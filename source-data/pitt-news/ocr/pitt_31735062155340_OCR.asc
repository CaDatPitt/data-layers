Berkeley Students Win

Full Faculty Support
After Demonstrations

By ALAN SCHLOSSER _

Students and faculty at the University, although often
unaware of the speciﬁc issues at stake, generally approved
of the Berkeley protests as being a legitimate exercise in
student rights. There was, furthermore, the belief that the
administrators of the University of California are men of sensitivity
and good will but they committed many tactical errors when
confronted with student demonstrations.

The University of California at Berkeley, for more than a week
the scene of mass rallies and protest demonstrations, returned to a
relative calm this weekend as the faculty senate, meeting in emer-
gency session, overwhelmingly endorsed student demands for un-
limited freedom in political activity,

The Berkeley Free Speech Movement (FSM), heartened by the
appearance of folk songstress Joan Baez, last week staged a massive
sit-in demonstration in Sproul Hall, the administration building. Pro-
testing a university ban on political activities at a traditional plot
of ground near Sather Gate, nearly 800 students were arrested in a
dramatic showdown with the California state police.

The next day, led by senior philosophy major Mario Savio, the
FSM executed a paralyzing student strike. In addition to undergrad-

\ uate boycotting, nearly 75 per cent of all graduate assistants refused

; to appear for their classes. Many senior faculty members joined the

graduate fellows in cancelling their classes as .a gesture of sympathy
for the arrested students, Furthermore, a student-faculty committee
raised over $80,000 to bail out the “prisoners”

' A Although the Free Speech Movement is a polyglot organization
{including such ideologically diverse groups as campus supporters of
‘Senator Barry Goldwater, the Young Republicans, the Young Demo-
crats, and the Marxist DuBois Club), is was apparent that the im-

Curriculum Questions Stir
Controversy In University

By LARRY BERNFELD ’
-Questions about the academic curricu-
lum raised at an SUB Forum panel dis-
cussion have resulted in a Welter of criti-

cism from students and administrators at
the University.

Panelists and members of the audience at
the Forum, “Advise .and Consent” directed ques-
tions pertaining to curriculum and the existence
of a curriculum committee to James Watson,
chairman of the liberal arts advising center. Wat-
son told the students that the advising center
worked within the limitations imposed by cur-
riculum; those seeking the possibility of change
should present their compliments to the curricu-
lum committee.

Forum series -chairman Warren Brennan, act-
ing upon .an audience suggestion, announced that

he would contact members of the administration _

in order to propose a Forum featuring a repre-
sentative of the curriculum committee. Brennan
and SUB chairman Mike Marcuse attempted to
locate the chairman of this committee but found,
in their inquiries, that a standing curriculum
committee does not exist.

Interested students and administrators have
submitted letters to The Pitt News expressing
their views on the questions raised at the Forum.

Russel Dixon, assistant -dean of the school
of liberal arts, has personally received inquiries
on this matter. Though he feels that students
have a right to be displeased and state their
disyleasure, he ‘strongly disapproves of a ‘‘we’ll
fix you” attitude which he sees prevalent among

students seeking to “overcome in two weeks .

what has happened in ﬁve years.” .
He stated that there is no ﬁxed curricul
committee in the sense that four or ﬁve men
have a permanent appointment and a perma-
ment job. The committee convenes from time to
time as the need arises and is not a ﬁxed entity.

"Dean Albert B. Martin was appointed to -

overhaul an old and antiquated curriculum. He
worked on it for a year,” Dixon said. It was then
submitted for final approval to a com-
mittee representing faculty of professorlal rank.

Dixon feels that student examination into
the workings of_the curriculum committee takes
it out of context and is improper. As a Parallel
Dixon suggested that,if he was, as a citizen. dis-
satisﬁed with higher education, he couldn’t go
to Washington and demand that the Committee
of Higher Education come before him to personal-
ly hear his complaint. -

Dixon does feel that a proper vehicle of
complaint exists--the right to petition. Students
can make their feelings known, he said, "by draw-
ing up a bill of complaint and by directing it to
the Dean of the School of Liberal Arts.” The vari-
ous committees involved “act only in an advi-
sory committee to the dean.”

Dr. Albert Martin, dean of the School of
Liberal Arts, is on a years leave of absence to

Nigeria. Dr. Putnam Jones, dean of the Graduate '

Faculty, is serving as acting dean of the School
of Liberal Arts. Martin, according to Dean Dixon
will return in September and would be interest-
ed in receiving complaints, Dean Dixon -feels

_Student Hit
On Bigelow

William Farmiere, a fresh-
man from Brentwood, was

struck by a car late Wednes-

day afternoon as it swung
._. around a truck which had
stopped to let two other Uni-
versity students cross the
-sizreet. The accident occurred at
‘I’ .‘j;.e crosswalks betwen the Cathe-
9 ‘ital and the Student Union.
3 Holding his right leg, Farmiere
g explained to a small crowd of by-
standers, “It just felt as if his
bumper hit me. I don’t think it’s
broken.” He was then lifted onto
a stretcher and placed in an am-
bulance. The small crowd of wit-
nesses and spectators that had
built up was pushed back to the
sidewalk as the ambulance sped
away.

The driver of the car was
Richard Beberidge of Perrywood
Ave. 'When Beberidge told one
of the ambulance drivers that he
had hit Farmiere, he was told to
Wait for a police car. '

Beberidge, a student'from the
Pittsburgh Institute of Aviation,
was accompanied by two other
students—from the same school at
the time of the accident.
;Pau1 Harvey, driver of the
‘duck, stated that before he knew
it he saw a car pull out and hit
Farmiere,

Traffic on Bigelow Ave. was
not obstructed by the accident.

JFK Fund Plans Scholarship

' By FRED FRANK .

The John F. Kennedy Schol-

Student’s Organization

their basic plans for the es-
tablishment of a scholarship
in memory of the late presi-
dent. Vasanth K. Bhat, chairman
of the meeting held last Tuesday,
announced that the organization
is seeking the support of other

student organizations on Pitts-  A

burgh college campuses to fur-
ther their scholarship goals.
Bhat announced that organiza-
tion will have three basic pur-
poses to (1) reﬂect the idealism
and leadership of President Ken-
nedy, (2) establish scholarships
to provide better educational op-
portunities for the students of
the world, and (3) to promote

mutual understanding between

students and scholars of the
world.

It was emphasized that the or-
ganization in Pittsburgh will
serve as the “alpha chapter” or
nucleus for the scholarship fund
and the students hope to expand
the organization nationally and
internationally.

The idea for the fund began in
the minds of several students
from local college campuses who
visited Washington in December,
1963, to pay homage to the mem-
ory of the late president. Bhat
pointed out, that students wanted
to establish an organization that
would be oriented to reflect _the

deep interest of President Ken-
nedy,"-in‘_ promoting student — -,c,u_,l-’ "

Sales Tax
Issue Still
Unresolved

By AL JANEZICA , ,

The University still hasn’t
received an answer on when
or if the ﬁve per cent state

sales tax on college textbooks
Will be lifted.

» During a college press confer- ‘‘

ence in Harrisburg last week,
Gov. William W. Scranton said
that though he is “sympathetic
to the idea” of nixing the sales

tax on textbooks, “we run into A

key problems.” Though he didn’t
elaborate, he did say that what
is needed to correct the setup -is
constitutional revision. “I would
support such constitutional revi-
sion,” he said. “It is the greatest
need in Pennsylvania.”

Late in October, Student Gov-I 1_
ernment received a letter from —

Gov, Scranton stating that any
action on the textbook tax would

have to be taken by the state 
legislators in its next full session, i

convening in January.

In a response to a question  "S
about state aid to private schools, . ’,
which includes the University,«.' I
the Governor said that he would
rather support the student",
through scholarships and loandlft

than subsidize the individual col-‘ 
lege or university. . -;_ .

“There are enough who want 1

A 1963 issue of Musical

 

A America nominated 22 year

of America’s most outstand-

cert for the Y Musical Society,

I it Miss Saks demonstrated that she

is a most outstanding young per-

" former, as well as a most beauti-
’ fu1 woman.

This winner of the Moscow In-

_ ternational Tschaikovsky Compe-

tition displayed remarkable ver-
satility,
Bach to Debussy. Miss Saks Was
most at ease with the romanti-

, cism of Chopin's “Pollinaise Bril-

lante” and the impressionism of
Debussy’s “Sonate.”

— . Her interpretation of the

Brahnm’s “Sonata No. 2 in F” re-
ﬂected this ﬂare for the emo-

, tional. At times she produced too

little dynamic contrast, in the
face of a continual emotional ef-
Musicologist Walter Nie-

did not condone impetuousness

Unfortunately Miss Sak’s open-
ing selection, the Beethoven “So-
nata No. 4 in C,” did not have

ticeable ﬂaw was the lack of rap-

?port with her pianist Edward

skill. The piano dominated pass-
ages, completely, partly due to
the score and partly due to Auer’s
lack of restraint.

Miss Sak’s wielded amazing
control with chords. She achieved
a vibrato effect primarily with

, her ‘bow, quite an unconvention-

al technique. The Allegro move-
ment of the Bach “Sonata No, 2
in D,” however, sounded a little
scratchier than is excusable and
the higher register lacked con-
trol. , _ _

The Debussy and Chopin pieces,
her last selections, demanded
exactly the technique which she

displayed throughout. The De-

 

bussy Sonate has a kinship with
the old Italian-French commedia
del’ arte. The abundance of piz-
zicatr; suggest the mandolin and
is vividly contrasted with ro-
mantic strains.

Miss Saks performed this num-
ber, which keenly reflects a re-
turn to the Roccoco, with feeling
for the varied moods. She
achieved real pianos and fortes
and again demonstrated good
bowing control. For the first time
tones from the highest positions
she effected clean and strong
of the cello. (The farther up on
the keyboard one plays the more
difficult the control.) Miss Saks
punctuated her skill and handled
the elusive harmonics quite com-
petently.

In Chopin's “Polonaise Bril-
liante,” Miss Saks also displayed
heightened sensitivity to the com-
poser. This selection demanded
control and strength of the high-

' er positions; and Miss Saks pleas-

ingly provided this. 'She was
particularly adept. on descending
passages, which rhapsodically
swept from the lower strings to
the top ofgthe bridge.

Miss Saks played her last nu.m-
ber without music .and the others"
with music. This is unusual. A
virtuoso generally memorizes his
repertoire. A young artist, Miss
Saks, has not yet attained this

level, Still, fora young artist,

her performance was outstand-
ing.

Sexuality Considered
As Inherently Good i

Collegiate Press Service
Human sexuality should be considered as inherently
good and as a result sex is fun, funny, and natural, the
Reverend Frederick G. Wood, Jr., of Goucher College told

his congregation recently.

arated from the rest of one’s ac-
- tivities and “assumed to be
fraught with" all kinds of special
meanings and mystical signiﬁ-
cance_,” he said.

“Sexuality itself is good,” he
said, “from the structure of the
human organism as male and fe-
male to. every conceivable act of
sexual self-expression, There is
nothing bad or dirty or pervert-
ed about it.”

The Reverend said he hadn’t
told the students “whether you
should or you shouldn’t or even
how far you should go,” because
to do so would be to violate ir-
responsibly individual freedom.

He said the primary implica-
tions of the concept that sexual-
ity is good are that sex is fun
and natural. “Because sex is fun,
it is freely chosen,” he said. “Be
cause sex is fun, it is not to be
understood ‘ as something which
we owe to anyone, whether that
obligation is understood in terms
of a debt to be paid after acer-
tain number of dates, or as con-
formity to the generalized~expec-
tations of a group.” ‘

By “funny” Wood said he was
referring not only to the humor’
attachedto sex, but to its playful,
creative aspects. ‘.‘And this means.
thatéthere are no laws attached
to sex,”.he said. “I repeat, ab-'
solutely no laws, Anyone who
tells you there are may be guilty
of mistaking. social and cultural
custom for divine sanction.

The fact that sex is natural
does not relegate it to the posi-
tion of being merely a natural
function which has one speciﬁc
purpose and no other, Wood said.

ural, and has the natural func-
tion of the nourishment and pres-

“Eating, for example, is also nat- V

  

Wood said students tend to take sexual expression far
too seriously and that they should quit doing so. It is sep-

ervation of the organism. But
most of my gourmet friends
would be rather abashed if I told
them that they should engage in
eating only for these purposes.”
According to the Bible sexualtiy
is more than good; it is creative,
and from this concept comes the
possibiliy of distinguishing be-
tween a hedonist and a belivcr.
Reasonably reliable methods of
birth control exist, Wood said,
but the control of fertility does
not appear to be the ﬁnal issue.
“Heterosexual union -is always at
least potentially creative of an-
other person-—a person, not just
some little baby who may be

viewed as a nuisance or .an un-'

fortunate inconvenience, but an-
other person, for whom his crea-
tors are deeply and intimately
responsible.” To disregard this
potential creativity is to deprive
sex of much that makes it mean-

maful

 _ He also said .“sex is creative as

a means of self-fulﬁllmen .”
“If sex is creative in the sense
of being a means of interperson-
al fulﬁllment,” Wood said, “then
perhaps we need to acknowledge
that sex may have something to
do with those relations we char-
acterize as -love relationships;

that is, relationships marked by ..

certain" V mutualities __of. grespmt-,
consideration‘ and 

“The "believer will ﬁnd himself
raising the question whether sex
outside of such a love relation-
ship is not at least potentially
destructive, rather than creative,
and therefore less than fully sex,”
he said. 7

Wood said marriage is a sym-
bol for this type of relationship,
but the content can exist without
the symbol, just as the symbol
does not necessitate the content.’

 

SANTA CLAUS visited the Towers Thursday night to help the students decorate the Christmas tree.

Year in Europe Study Program

By JACKI KATZ
The Regional Council for

International Education is
sponsoring a study year, a-
broad for 1965-66 at the Uni-
versity of Basel in Basel,
Switzerland.

This study program is special
in two ways, according to David
S. Hoopes, assistant director Of
the Oﬁice of Cultural and Edu-
cational Exchange (OCEE). “First,
it is sponsored by the Council,
and secondly, it is not a lan-
guage program and it has a speci-
ﬁc focus of study — European
Internationa1ism,” Hoopes said.

The Regional Council for In-
ternational Education cpnsists of
30 colleges and universities in
the Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West
Virginia area. Council headquar-
ters is at the University and Dr.
Shepherd L. Witman, director of
OCEE, is president,

' Since there is a movement in
Europe towards an international
organization, the program is at-
tempting to identify an “inter-
cultural” society, an inter-mixing
of impulses in art, literature and
drama. “The whole effort is to
ﬁnd that which, is European,
rather than what is national,”
Hoopes explained.

, The courses are ‘given by the
Americans. The Council also util-
izes European guest lecturers.
“The courses are designed along
the lines of American education
so that it meets requirements of
higher educational institutions
and that students will receive
credit,” Hoopes continued. Field
work for the piiogram is parti-
cularly in the cultural areas.

Although almost all of the
courses are given in English, a
Working knowledge of a modern
European language is required.
The program is a resident aca-

Year Abroad  

Program Set
By Institute

The Institute of European
Studies will conduct the ﬁrst
junior year abroad program

for American engineering
and mathematics students
at the University of Nan-
tes, France, beginning, in
Sept. 1965.

Students with junior standing
and a year of college French will
take French-taught courses in
their major ﬁelds while living in
private homes in Nantes. Students
will be able to take summer trai-
nee jobs in French industries.

The cost of $2,650 for the pro-
gram will include tuition, room
and board, transportation and
trips to Paris and the Alps. Ap-
plications are due by May 10.
Additional information may be
obtained from the Institute of
European Studies, 35 E. Wack-
er Drive, Chicago.

demic one with the classes at B3-
sel, Switzerland, and trips made
from there.

“This type of program is need-
‘ed to meet the demand and need
of students outside of the lan-
guage area,” Hoopes explained.’
This is the ﬁrst time the Region-
al Council is’ instituting a study
year abroad program. Basel ..is
located where France and Ger-
many meet the border of Swit-
zerland and form multilingual
communities.

Approximately 60 students will
participate in the 1965-66 pro-
gram, which is open to both men
and Women and to students out-
side the Regional Council schools.
Students from Regional Council
Institutes will receive priority
consideration if the program
reaches its capacity.

Students applying for the pro-
gram must have completed two
full years of college, and be jun-
iors while abroad. All candidates
must be majoring in the social
sciences or humanities, excluding
foreign languages. Also a mini-
mum B average is expected.

The candidate's major depart-
ment and dean must recommend
him, and he must have had at
least two courses in his major
ﬁeld and have studied modern
European history at the college
level.

Each student accepted will live

Cal Campus
Now Calm

(Cogztinued from Page 1)

Despite cries of “Marxism”
from the Hearst-owned San Fran-
cisco lkaminer and the general
disapproval of the nation’s news
media, it was very clear that
there was widespread discontent
among students and faculty mem-
bers alike. The FSM outdoor
rallies consistently attracted ten
to 12 thousand people, and as
indicated by the voting of the
faculty senate, the great major-
ity of Berkeley professors also
backed the movement’s reform
program,

The proposals adopted by the
faculty senate would give stu-
dents the right to espouse any
cause on campus and would make
students immune from univer-
sity disciplinary action for off-
Campus political activity. These
recomendations must now be act-
ed upon by the California Board
of Regents,

with a Swiss family during the
academic year. The students are
under the immediate supervision

of the American Program Direc- '

tor and his wife.

Cost of the progr.am, including
transportation from New York
to Basel and return, health in-
surance, tuition, planned excur-
sions, room and board, is $2,250.
The cost does not include room
and board during the Christmas
holidays, independent travel, pass
port expenses, gratuities, ship-
ment of excess baggage, books,
laundry, supplies, and other in-
cidental personal expenses.

A $10 application fee is re-
quired with every application
and is refundable only if the ap-
plication is rejected. All applica-
tions must be received by March
1.

Application forms are available
from the academic deans and
liason representatives of the Re-
gional Council schools. They
should be mailed to Regional
Council Study Abroad, 201 Amos
Hall.

The Regional Council is at-
tempting to co-ordinate efforts
in international projects, accord-
ing to Hoopes.

, Once upon a time, werare

a kingdom. It was the France
 of the 1930’s, and it fell un-
’ der the Nazis. Many French

citizens who didn’t like their
new government, including
Albert Camus and Jean-
Paul Sartre, worked under-
ground in the Resistance.

ple and other things. In or-
der to appreciate lif'e, he
says, we must always -be
aware of our fate, which
consists both of death and

3 ~ of a staggering burden of

responsibility, that freedom
which is our life. For him,
there i's no compulsion for
a conscious mind, no matter
what the circumstances. His
outlook still proves signifi-
cant to the marginal man:
the poverty stricken, the op-

, pressed, the captive, the’ali-

enated. We admire Sartre’s
and humanism
when he affirms freedom,

action and responsibility in ‘

‘abstract.

BUT HE goes further.
He holds that the most es-

. _ sential feature of man is a

freedom to be negative, e.g.
to refuse Nobel Prizes, and
this is more objectionable.

We might imagine Sar-
tre would contend, in his

that the philosopher must

Watson’s Ability

_g & Editor,’The Pitt, News:

 -_i _’ .lVice-Chancellor Alan Rankin’s

successor should be a man fami-
liar with student affairs, familiar

 with the administrative struc-

ture, and possessed of education-
al views which are both imagina-
tive and profound. Such a man
is James Watson, presently di-
rector of the Liberal Arts Advis-
ing Center.

In his directorship of the Cen-
ter, and in his participation in
last Friday’s discussion, Mr. Wat-
son has exhibited great intimacy
and Sympathy with the problems
of students (“If you don’t like it

when it isn’t. To Sartre, it
would seem, something can
be true only when (a) you
can't deﬁne it or touch it, or
(b) you can make some

cryptic statement about it, .

such as his defender’s gem,
“The philosopher must al-
ways be the ultimate sub-
versive.” " '

Much in Sartre may be
compared with Heraclitus,
a Greek philosopher who
flourished about 500 B. C.
His utterances capture
much of Sartre’s spirit: “It
is the opposite which is
good for us;” “Strif'e is Jus-
tice, and . . . all things come
into being and pass away
through strife;” “Men do

not know how what is at

variance agrees with itself.
It is an attunement of op-_
posite tensions, like that of

' the bow and lyre.”

IN 500 B.C., oracular style
was fashionable. In today's
world, though, where much
of Sartre’s thought is in-
spiring, the obscure, aphor-
istic style he uses so often
will not do. Similarly, it
seems there would be for
Sartre no world without a
Heraclitean strife or ten-
sion. The prize is good for
Sartre, thus, only when it
can symbolize strife, nega-
tion. Acceptance of the
prize, he assumes, would
commit him to a Western-
ized viewpoint, and thereby
destroy the healthy tight-
rope strung between East
and West. But as things
now stand, he can still “a-
gree with himself,” while
“at variance with himself.”

R. L. Bruckberger, in
The New York Times of No-
vember 15, says: “By refus-
ing the Nobel prize, it is the
legitimacy of all institu-
tions, and perhaps of the
social order itself, that Sar-
tre is attacking. He likes
to destroy; he likes to blow
up hard-won positions un-
der our feet. It is less easy
to see what he can construct,
other than an assemblage
of words.”

As has been the case

with most systematic phil-
osophers, Sartre spins a

indicates natural talent at sur-
vival in the bureaucratic jungle.

-It was not, however, until-last
Friday that the profundity-of his
educational philosophy was made
public. Contradicting the vulgar
view that it is only from courses
that are good, or moderately de-
cent, that students learn any-
thing worthwhile, Watson asserts
that “it is just as valuable to
take a bad course as it is to take
a good course, because you learn
what bad courses are like.”

The opportunity to make James
Watson vice- chancellor should
not be missed, for it is seldom
that a man combining so much
experience, ability and vision
comes along. Pitt deserves all of
them it can get.

world out of unique vocabu-
lary. Yet Sartre asserts em-
phatically that his philoso-
pl"-.y is unsystematic, even
anti—systemati'c. He too
weaves a matchstick world
of Words. -

Sartre notwithstanding,
we like to think that virtue,
justice, dignity,’ and free-‘
dom require no hypothetical
categories such as “for-it-
self,” “nihilation” or “nau-~

sea” as presuppositions.

_ OF COURSE, we must
work to help assure all men
the freedom to develop
themselves. But many men
are free and aware, and
realize it. Must they‘ all
write U. S. A.’s or paint
Guernica’s? I think not.
Men can utilize their more
objective, equally fulfilling,
equally “human” faculties
to advance critical inquiry.
To be philosophical is to
be able to see relations
which apply in all disci-
plines, and at the same time
to study critically the uses
of that reason which tries
to penetrate the world. To
contrast Sartre’s—or any—
synthetic philosophy with
“narrow, useless” philoso-
phy is to distort the panor-
ama of reason. The contem-
porary philosopher func-
tions not simply as a world-
machine creator, but labors
rather toward the end of
uniting different forms of
experience. He attempts to
distinguish and clarify, to
self-realize vvhile inter-as-
sociating. He must be able
to establish criteria for val-
id claims. He must have a
sense of discipline, and be
willing to admit of errors
including, at times, those in-
volving subjectivity. To de-
ny these characteristics is to
demonstrate an inadequate
conception of philosophy.
So let the philosopher
be politically “engaged.”
Let him act to improve the
lot of society. But don’t tell
him to construct a world out
of a mystical, neo-alchemi-
cal admixture of depth psy-
chology, sociology, ethical
theories, poetic ambiguity
and indigestion symptoms.

C g S‘ t t‘
. by Irv Garfinkel
The general press coverage of the United States and
Belgian civilians as hostages. They threatened to massacre
more to muddle than to clarify the issues involved. Few
students, or Americans in general, understand why the_
African countries would want to protest such an “obviously”
humanitarian mission. A littlehistorical background will
go a long way towards clarifying the situation.

GARFINKEL

When the Congo became independ-
dent in 1960, Moise Tshombe, head of
mineral-rich Katanga province, led a
revolt to secede from the Congo. Most
Africans blame him for the murder of
Patrice Lumumba, the ﬁrst Congolese
prime minister. Even after Lumum-
ba’s death, Tshombe fought the Con-
golese government and the United Na-
tions. Six months ago, after the U.N.
pulled out of the Congo, and when the
national government was on the verge
of collapse, Tshombe was asked to at-
tempt to form a government.

Lumumba’s followers, however, refused to recognize
Tshombe. Premier Tshombe now found that he couldn’t
suppress this revolt with his own army. So he began hir-
ing white mercenaries. Tshombe hired his mercenaries in
Rhodesia and South Africa. .With the help of these mercen- .
aries» and American planes piloted by anti-Castro Cuban,
and American mercenaries, Tshombe has been able to make
military progress in the civil War. -

YET THIS MILITARY progress was not without its
price. The mercenaries have been carrying on a slaughter
of blacks ever since Tshombe ﬁrst hired them. But white
terrorization of blacks does not make headlines in the U.S.

_ There were no pleas to send an aid mission to protect the

Congolese natives who were at the mercy of their white
South African benefactors. But if most Americans were
not aware of what was going on in the Congo, Africans

were.

As Tshombe’s army began closing in on Stanleyville,
then the rebel stronghold, the rebels took American and
Belgian ‘civilians as hostages. They threatened to massacre
these people if Tshombe’s army continued to advance. It
was at this point that the U.S.-Belgian mercy mission took
place. And in the process of saving our missionaries we

handed Stanleyville to Moishe Tshombe. If we bear in mind i A

that most Africans, to say the least, dislike Tshombe, their
protest becomes more understandable.

THE RESCUE MISSION by itself, however, is not at
issue. What is at issue is our policy in the Congo. To aid
and support a man like Tshombe is sheer stupidity.

We oppose the rebels because, supposedly, they are

Communists.

Yet once we interfere in the internal affairs

of another country to prevent a Communist takeover, we‘
become responsible for the alternative government. If we
claim the credit for -preventing communism in the Congo,

Vwe can not disclaim Tshombe.

But no man who hires white South African mercenar-
ies, can win the popular support of the Congolese natives.
Tshombe will never be able to rule without terror. The
rebels, with the aid of other African countries, will increase

the tempo of guerilla warfare.

Unless we immediately disassociate ourselves from
Tshombe, we will have another Viet Nam. Now that We've

rescued our missionaries, let us try to salvage our foreign .

policy.

Perhaps the faculty has not

then again, have you done all
that has been wished by the fac-

seems to be confused? You can-
not expect a’ red carpet rolled
down in front of you and neither

' can a professor expect that he is

stimulating every student.

I am sorry if you have a bitter-
taste in‘your mouth. This, how- —

ever, may be due to your own
stale and unchanging opinions of
Pitt. Pitt is changing and doing
an adequate job most of the time.

It is as important to support as

is to criticize, Both student and

Engineering colleges should integrate the social sciences with
their discipline; otherwise, two Washington experts warn, the engi-
neer will not be prepared for his future environment.

This assessment came from two men concerned with changing

defense department research requirements, arms control and disarma-

ment and their effects on engineering—-Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Arms Control Arthur W. Barber and Michael Michaelis, a

. researcher for the United States Chamber of Commerce.

Both men.see beginnings of a— trend away from defense-related
engineering. Instead, engineering will be concentrated on solving
such social problems as urban transportation, housing and exerting
the food supply. -

Barber noted that this movement has begun. He said that the fed-
deral government allows military research contractors to determine

if their companies can move into such civilian ﬁelds by changing

feasibility studies and some research to defense contract overhead
costs. ’

He cited a design for a technologically eﬁicient, lower-operating
cost design for a hospital which some West Coast defense contractors
are attempting to sell.

“Companies should deploy their major asset _ the ability to at-

I ,tack a major social problem through a massive technological system,”

Michaelis said.
“Technologically speaking, they could do it, but they are in-
hibited by laws, regulations, old codes and a tax structure which

‘ inhibits the use of available technical knowhow. These laws reﬂect

the past not the future,” he continued.
Michaelis noted that 70 per cent of university research is under-

written by the federal government, particularly defense-related

agencies.

“The danger,” he noted, “is that this creates young men to whom

the future industrial environment will be quite foreign. It might tend
to ‘create people who ﬁnd it hard to address themselves to mundane,
earthy problems.” .- ‘
’ Barber agreed. “Many engineers are now trained to ignore costs,
their primary .aim being to design a good product and at good qual-
ity. If engineers can’t take in economic factors, they are going to be
in difficulties even if they are quite competent.”

Michaelis said he did not think there is a need for curriculum
changes. “I suggest that“ universities take the lead, toward the inte-
gration of the scientist and the engineer with the social scientist.”

 

EX—Wave N ow Nursi

To Jane “Sage” N owlin, a freshman in nursing, a dorm-

. is a “barracks” and the cafeteria a “chow hall.” Sage, who

came to the University after serving three years as a
WAVE, and she still thinks in the Navy lingo.

Because Sage received a Navy scholarship — offered
as part of a Naval program to induce young women to join

the WAVES—she is directly at-
tached to the Nav.al recruiting
station in Pittsburgh. In granting
a scholarship "the Navy reserves
the right to choose to which
college a WAVE will be sent.

Sage, who joined the WAVES
after graduating from high school
in Dallas, Texas, held an I-LM3
rating (equivalent to a corporal)
when she transferred from the
WAVE base in Chelsea, Massa-
chussets, to the University.

While in the WAVES, Sage act-
ed as a corp WAVE in a hospital
in Chelsea, taking care of the
wives, mothers, and children of
servicemen. She “likes nursing
and likes the. Naval system of
nursing.” Nursing as a WAVE
seems easier to her than nursing
as a civilian because of the Navy's
“rigid chain of command.”

One advantage Sages sees to
WAVE life over the civilian life
of a college student is the ratio
of men to women. The smallest
ratio of Navy men to WAVES, at
any Naval base, is around ten-to-
one, compared with around three-
to-one at the University

“This trimester,” she indicated,
“is a period of adjustment be-
cause I’ve been out of school for
three years.” “No talking” had
ruled in her classes in boot camp
.and in corp camp. But, here, at
the University, “students are en-
couraged to speak up and to vol-
unteer to answer questions,” Sage
commented. “One of the ﬁrst
things I had learned as a WAVE,”
she wailed, “was never to volun-
teer!”

Sage, a member of Housing
Board, acts as historian for her
d0l‘mit0l'y and serves as a ﬂoor
representative and unofficial
“house mother” to the younger
freshmen.

Sage received her nickname in
high school when her geometry
class was given a theorem which
could be proven two different
ways. She solved the problem but
not by the method her teacher
wanted. The teacher remarked
that her solution certainly war-
ranted the name “s.,age”-—but that
she would still get a zero on the
Droblem if she didn’t solve it his
way.

Ronald Caplan is a graduate student in Eng-
lish and editor of the student literary magazine,
Ideas and Figures. Ronald Caplan is also a poet.

Today’s clothes and architecture are dis-
eased, Caplain maintains; clothing and jewelry
should be meaningful, not just something to put
on. Many girls remind him of machines, as they
walk down the street “all girdled” to please
men. . _

Caplan speciﬁcally criticizes the architecture
of the Towers Dormitories. “The ‘new dorms don’t
generate anything,” he explained. “They’re not

. beautiful because they’re not meaningful—no

matter how. pretty they look.”

The plants around the dorm seem to Cap-
lan like a small gesture to “really beautiful green
things” that could have grown there. “Sort of
like ﬂowers on a grave.”

He contrasted the Towers with the Pennsyl-
vania railroad station, which “looks like a place
where a man can sweat.” It seems “almost im-
moral to sweat in the dorms.” -

Gazing out the window, Caplan noted that
people curiously stare at holes and machinery
when buildings are being constructed. It is
strange that a hole fascinates people; but they
hardly notice the ﬁnished building, he pointed
out. A ‘ .
Caplan believes that anything one is not in-
terested in is not Worth doing. Yet, “lust abmlt
everything has something in it that can be in-

" teresting.” Simply walking and talking are worth

spending hours at, he asserted, quoting the poet
Zukofsky: “Talking is a form of love, let us talk.”

Caplan writes poetry because he likes to.
He writes just to see what he’ll write and to
arrange a few things that are on his mind. He
commented, “The mistake is to ask a person

ideas and iiiguresp      

RON CAPLAN
“Let Us Talk”

what kind of poetry he does; there’s a sense to
the word kind which infers that he’s not doing
his own work. If he is——that’s his kind.”

Later Caplan continued his self description.
‘‘i’m very middle class that is have a middle class
background and my people are middle class—,_”
he typed. “it’s nice being nioe—it is nice they
(his parents) love me and have their problems
which isn’t so nice but get worked out which
is nice.”

Ronald Caplan is middle class and he goes
to a middle class college——but he cares: “and my
middle class eyes see the university as sometimes
nice it does not impose so is nice but sometimes
makes me sad which is seeing workmen in the
cellar of the university with only light bulbs
hanging bare from a single wire and the Ina-
chinery cramped together you’d think they didn’t
have .a union but they do have a union but can
be fied anyhow so they don’t say much.”_

Defense Poses New Problem

By FRANK sMIziK
A defensive team played
against the Panthers last
Tuesday night, and they
found it tougher than play-

' ing an offensive team and

lost to the Wisconsin Bad-
gers, 80-63. Wisconsin dominated
the boards while giving the Pan-
thers few clear shots.

 didn’t play any de-
fense and this team did. We

e ‘V were forced into mistakes and
lost the ball several times with-

out getting a shot. We made
more errors than in any game
this season,” said Coach Bob
Timmons. .

Mark Zubor, the man who ‘beat
them last year at Wisconsin was
again the man the Panthers
could not stop. “He had his best

game‘ of the season against us

last season and his rebounding
and shooting hurt us again this
year,” said Timmons.

.“They had too much size for
us and our big men couldn’t box
them out underneath the boards.
They wouldn’t only get around
us butithey would also out-jump

 us and get tap-ins” said Tim-

1110118.

Zubor, who had 28 points, tied
his career high that he set against
the Panthers last year. He scored
mostof his points on tap-ins .and
on lay-ups.

One of the reasons for Wiscon-
sin having so many easy shots
was the zones press employed by

the Panthers. The team couldn’t
double team effectively to force
the Badgers into mistakes.

“We use that defense to make
the other team play faster and
hope that they shoot too fast or
throw the b.all away,” said Tim-
mons. “Our guys just C0uldI1”0
work it right and Wisconsin, with
some smart ball handling, and
passing beat our defense.”

“The guys are still green yet
and all we can do is go with the
‘sophomores that we have. They'll
make mistakes but they’ll im-
prove as they go along.”

One sophomore who did im-
press Tirnmons was Roth Mc-
Nally. “He did a good job .and
shot pretty well. I’m thinking of
moving Falenski to forward and
keeping McNally at guard,” said
Timmons.

“The position that we are real-
ly hurting at is forward. It
seems that Falenski has the soph-
omore ‘jitters, but. he is slowly
coming out of it. He started to
shoot more in the .Wisconsin
game and seems to be loser out
on the court.”

The Panthers still haven't been
able to get a balanced scoring
attack from all ﬁve men. They
also had another low ﬁeld goal
percentage as they shot only 35
per cent against Wisconsin.

Daryle Ruby was the high
scorer for the Panthers with 14

Spirited Second Half Play Nets

By JAY‘ ROSENSTEIN

Strong second -half play
has enabled the freshman
basketball team to post two
consecutive victories against
no losses.

Last Tuesday at the Field
House, the Cubs won their sec-
ond game in a hard-fought con-
test, 82-66, over Point Park Jun-
ior College. The half-time score
showed only a three point lead
for the hoopsters, 32-29. Ken Bol-
lens had led the offense in the
ﬁrst half with 20 points. The
Point Park 2-1-2 zone had given
the frosh some trouble in the
early going. ,

The complexion of the game

changed in the second half. Des-
I pite the fact that Bollens had to

leave the game early in the half
because of foul trouble, the Cubs
still scored 50 points in the per-

iod to settle the contest.

Bob Thompson scored 14 of his
18 points in the second half and
Frank Famularo hit for 13 of his
total of 15 points in the second
half. Bill Buck scored 11 points,
seven in the last period. Bollens
was--‘the ga.me’s high scorer with
23 points in about 23 minutes of

_ play.

“They played their game in
the third quarter,” said Coach
Carl Peterson. “They didn’t let
Point Park’s press bother them
.at all. In fact, they scored more

v off Point Park’s press than Point

Park did.” Petersonwasimpressed
with the speed and aggressiveness
of the Point Park squad. “Our
guards did ,one nice job in bring-
ing the ball up court,” he noted,
“that’s good against an agressive
team.”

In their ﬁrst game of the sea.-
S0n. the Cubs coasted to a 73-59

victory over St. Vincent's frosh.
They had leads of 14 to 16 points
throughout most of the second
half; Assistant Coach Tim Grg-
urich observed that “we controll-
ed the boards for most of the
game. The boys were executing
the box-out technique of rebound-
ing real well.”

 

Army.

Coach Grady never com-
mits himself to a pre-game
line-up until the day of the
meet. “I never give out my
line-ups to anyone,” he said,
“. . . even the boys don’t
know what they will swim
until the meet.” It keeps them on
their toes because they should be
prepared for anything.”

The swimming team devoted
much time to distance and con-
ditioning work during the pre-
vious practices. Swimmers exer-
cise themselves into condition
slowly while looking ahead to
the winter months. “They point
for the latter part of March and
the championships the big
ones,” he said.

It’s too_ early to give a fair
evaluation of the team but Grady
expects to “get a better line on
them after the Christmas vaca-
tion.” According to Grady the
sophomores are “coming along”
and will be ready for Army.

Grady said that he didn’t know
whether there would be practice
during vacation because some
boys will be going home but he
would work something out.

Besides Army, the team will
swim against Ohio University, In-
diana, Syracuse, and Bucknell at

home while traveling to Mary-
land, Miami of Ohio, and North
Carolina State. -

A dual meet with Wisconsin at
Michigan State on February 27
will complete the schedule.

Hard Meet with Army

Army opposes the swimming team at Trees Pool on
December 19 but ‘Coach Ben Grady isn’t overly excited about
their arrival. “I’d just as soon be in Florida,” he said.

“Army has a well-balanced team and is strong in every
event,” Grady said. Although the team is coming along
ﬁne,” Grady expects them to have trouble with “three-deep”

We get pretty concerned
aboutthe way life insurance
is often sold.

We're not in favor of a
client just buying a policy
and getting it over with. We
want him to understand —
what it's all about, how his
policy can be made to serve
a variety» of future needs,
how it will fit into an overall
financial program tailored
to his own requirements.

It’s this approach that
separates the professional
from the ordinary salesman.
And if you feel you'd be
more satisfied dealing with
a professional, we're at
your service.

Gym Team‘ Healing
 After Injury Plague

The gymnastics team is
quickly recovering from a
rash of injuries that have

plagued its pre-season work-
outs. The major question re-
maining is Whether the re-
covery will have been com-
pleted by the schedule opener,
Jan, 9, against Slippery Rock.

The big question mark is soph-
omore stand-out Ig Perez. Perez
injured his wrist over a month
ago and his training schedule has
been handicapped as a result.

“If Perez and another sopho-_ V

more, Jim Sacco, can round into
shape, they could mean -the dif-
ference between a good and bad
season,” said coach Warren Neig-
er. “The team will probably blos-
som according to their efforts.”

“Perez, when he catches up in
his conditioning, -could easily be
a six event man,” continued Neig-
er. “He’s probably the best paral-
lel bar man we have.”

Sacco, like Perez, has the po-
ten’£ia1—.of being a six-event con-
_tender. In  senior year at But-
ler High School he was the West-

": tern Pennsylvania All-Around

Ch3mPi0I1 in gymnastics.

Retllrning from last year's
squad, which managed to post
-only two victories, .are Tom Mi.
sage, Roland Jones, Dave Mc-
Kinnis and Jack Schwar.

Misage specializes on the hori-

_ zontal bar. Neiger terms James

the best side horse’ expert onthe
Squad. Schwar’s skills are exer-
cised on the long horse.

“We're strongest on the side

ital bar,” said Neiger. “An inter-
esting event to watch will be the
trampoline. It has just been add-
ed to the Eastern colleges’ rou-
tine.”

Gary Barr, thebest trampolin-
ist for the Panthers, is recover-
ing from minor surgery on his

that Dr. Martin is the proper ‘

man to see as it is his curricu-
lum under examination. The lib-
eral arts dean would in turn
confer with the deans of the
three academic divisions involved
who would contact the chair.
man and faculty under them.
“These problems,” he said, “are
not settled in an arbitrary man-
ner.” _

Brennan supported the panel
form of examining the problem

in the near future.

Marcuse supported these views.
“Any method which does not
provide for an open exchange of
ideas falls short in providing the
maximum amount of information
for all concerned. Letters, peti-
tions and editorials should not
be disregarded, but they lack
the give and take of a responsi-
bly conducted discussion.”
