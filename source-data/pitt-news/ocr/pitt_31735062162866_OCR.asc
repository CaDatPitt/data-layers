Results to Be Available
To Allin Booklet Flo.rInp:,

The Liberal Arts Cabinet has been authorized by thelad-
ministration to conduct a student evaluation of all courses at

the university.

The results of the evaluation in booklet form
‘made available to all students at a minimum cost. The eval-

would be

uation in each course would be concerned’ with the type‘ of

the . ability of ' the: ‘

book used,
teacher to present the material
and the number of papers and

tests that it would incur.

The booklet will serve a two-
fold purpose: ﬁrst, it will serve
the student as a source of prac-
tical information about courses;
second, it will; enable faculty
members to ‘become aware of
shortcomings w h i c h previously

had not been brought to their at-

tention. -
Selection of Data

There are two methods, both of-

which could be used in selecting
sufficient data for thejbooklet. One
would be to pass comment sheets
in the individual classroms. This
method will give a representative
sampling of all the classes under
consideration.
The other method would al-
low students to pick up comment
sheets at various places . about
the campus. This method could
serve as, a check.for the other,
since some students ‘may be
missing from class when com-
ment sheets are passed out.

A number of depositories would
be set up by the ‘Liberal Arts Cab-
inet where the completed evalu-
ation sheets would be turned in.
Compiling and tabulating the-.re-
sults would be done by the Cabi-
net, under the supervision. of Dr.
Albert Martin, dean of the School
of Liberal Arts. . .. '

Quality ' of ‘Evaluation ’
(According to James Groninger,
vice president of the Cabinet,
clearly written, thoughtful evalu-
ations would be weighed more
than vague likes. and dislikes.
Each evaluation sheet will
contain a brief introduction stat-

Shelley’ Berm an Lands
Good College Audiences

By LOIS DIAMOND

If Shelley Berman refused to be interviewed by nation-
ally known critic, Harold V. Cohen, of the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, would he permit -an interview with ‘a Pitt News
reporter, known in‘ the circle of those who read the Pitt
News? I was honered. He did.

The popular comedian was in Pittsburgh last week-end.

He made a special trip to the cityé

to perform at the winter formal
of the Pi Lambda Phi Fraternity.

I ~  “I was privi-
leged to work
for you,” Ber-
man remarked
at the end of
his chuckle-
ﬁlled hour of
telephone mon-
ologues (which
fulfilled h i s
contract to the
 exact second).
“I do not ﬁnd"
the college
audience snobbish.”

After two and one-half years
in show business, Shelly Berman
has become a favorite comedian.
As a product of the past decade,

he appeared on the “Fabulous
Fifties,” a television review.

Unwilling to respond to the
question, “How did you get start-
ed?” Berman answered, “Oh, that
would take much more than you
have room for. I began with dra-
matic acting—bit parts off Broad-
way and on television.”

Berman does notadvise young
people to enter serious dramatic
acting. “Actors can’t get work
. . . They starve. It’s easier to be
a comedian,” he admitted.

“I have no preferences to the
part of the count in which I
work,” said Berman. “Working for
everybody is fun, as long as peo-
ple are going along with me,” he
added in an after thought. “It is
a most gratifying experience to
perform for college people, he
commented. “They're hipper, _a
little more up, more perceptive.

“I have played in England,”
stated the comedian. Although he
did not ﬁnd much difference be-
tween the audiences here and
abroad, he did say, “America is a
hit.” Naturally, any audience is
difficult if a comedian is trying
to get across bad humor.

The laughter of an audience is
integral to my material,” continu-
ed Berman. “A singer can sing
his song without an audience . .
a. painter can paint without an
audience. But a comedian can’t
be funny without an audience.”

Agitated at being compared‘ to

SHELLEY
BERMAN

Mort Saul, Berman responded,
“Ridiculous! There is no compari-
son. He does topical humor. I’m
a dramatist of the human foible.”
Berman presents craicatures in
words.

“Where do you get your ideas?”-
I asked. “Something occurs tome
and I make it up,” said Berman.
“I write every work I say . .
I’m always adding new routines
to the old . . . People come to
see me ‘do. the things I do on-my
records. ‘Outside ‘Shelley Berman’
is my new.record,” he concluded.

 i Mixers to E valuations

The Liberal Arts Cabinet has taken a great step for-
ward in its newly-planned and authorized teacher and
course evaluation program. The program will result in the

, publication of an evaluation booklet that will include

critiques on the course work, the instructor and the text-

’ book used in the course.

— There is no doubt a use——-indeed; there is a need——for
such a program at the university. Once it is in full—scale
operation, the evaluation program can be nothing, but an
important aid both to those who are doing the teaching and
to those who doing the learning. _

‘ At various times the school cabinets have been criti-
cized for the lack of work they perform. In making a pro-

_ gram such as a teacher and course evaluation a reality, the

Liberal Arts Cabinet has justified its existence.

Perhaps this is just a starting point from which the
cabinets can branch out and delve more deeply into the
academic ﬁeld.

Why the 343

When it comes to ﬁnancial matters at the university, I

the two most hated items are tuition, especially tuition in-
creases, and the University Fee.

Although many students do not understand why they
must pay such an expensive price for their education in the
way of tuition, they nevertheless understand that by pay-
ing their $23 (almost $28) per credit they can take courses
here.  ‘

However, the University Fee presents no such cold,
hard, simple reason for its existence. The $48 fee constantly
comes under much criticism because its purpose is misun-
derstood. ._ T

The University Fee is not an activities fee. The concept
of an activities fee was dropped two years ago. Before that
time one dollar was taken from each credit of tuition and
placed into a student activities fund.

But today appropriations for student activities come
from the university. Thus, the money is taken from tuition,
state appropriations, gifts, grants, endowments and sales
of services.

As far as the $43 goe-s, it enters into student activities

only when any part. -of it which remains from its main use
is -placed into the universityfs general operational fund.
The greatest part of the University Fee, however, is

N earmarked for buildings—buying buildings and construct-

ing new ones. That is its main purpose-—buildings not ac-
tivities.

First Two Reasons Why

By David Brealtsfone

I have an alert friend who has been saying for
several years, “Our country is going to hell on a
toboggan and no one. is very concerned about it,
least of all college students.” A

He is, I suppose, what certain politicians would

Letters To The Editor

Elections Chailrrnain

Presents His Case
Editor, the Pitt News: V
Perhaps we should supplement
‘ some of the recent clownish ex-
changes in your newspaper in
reference to the political atmos-
phere of the university.

In your editorial of Feb. 10’

(“Upgrading th e Structure”),
you correctly enumerated the
primary functions of the Elec-
tions Committee. You went on
to imply, however, that because
ﬁve of the ten members of the
committee were connected with
the BIG Party, any crucial de-
cision of the committee would
have favored the party.

In previous Elections Commit-
tees when two parties prevailed,
the membership of the commit-
tees was made up of party sup-
porters, usually with both par-
ties having equal representation.
You yourself, Mr. Editor, as a
member of last spring’s elections
Committee, were an ardent sup-
porter of the PAP Party.

This year, with only one party,
a balance of membership was
again‘ struck; this time, however,
the balance was between party
supporters and party non-sup-
porters. ‘

The facetious comment which
one of the committee members
made in reference to the short-
age of candidates in the election
is far from representative of “the
thinking prevalent on the com-
mittee this year.”

The chairman, along with sev-
eral committee members, worked
behind the scenes to come up
with another presidential candi-
date. Perhaps there was a mo-

V ment when another presidential

aspirant could have been per-
suaded to run; unfortunately,

‘-'6

. this moment was either imper-

v

 

ceptible or inaccessible to us.
Other p ot e ntial candidates
must have‘ certainly been dis-
couraged by the screaming head-
lines: “Turner ‘Must’ Run.” It
must also be realized‘ that the
problem of “student apathy” is
far more general than the scope
of the Elections Committee.
The fact that the Elections

— Chairman must be .a member ‘of

SGA and the fact that T SGA
members are required to be on
SG-A committees accounts for the
interest of -some of this commit-
tee’s members in running for
election. We should be thankful
for the few who are showing a
continued interest in student
government.

In view of the open cynicism
towards the committee which
your editorial exhibits, I am sur-
prised that you never sent a Pitt
News representative to any of
our committee meetings after an
open invitation to do so; evident-
ly, the Pitt News is infected
with “student apathy.”

You were also quite unco-op-
erative by not printing subse-
quent information of the avail-
ability of petitions after an ex-
plicit request.

In conclusion, Mr. Editor, your
editorial of Feb. 10 has served
to substantiate the words of for-
mer Federal Supreme Court Jus-
tice Cardozo, who once stated
that “Wisdom in retrospect is
easy.”

For the philosophically inclined perhaps a few
seriousmusings might be in order. First, students
in the United States feel insigniﬁcant and power-
less in the face of the present ‘reality: the head-
long dash by powerful states "toward colossal war.
It is a delusion, I think, to call_ the arms race a
movement toward a ’permanent, safe, nuclear _

It is in reality a march toward attaining enough 4
weapons to eliminate the possibility of a counterﬁ-.
attack. American students are silent in the face
of the overwhelming equipment of this deadly

. contest, and believe the national myth that this
process is an inevitable, irreversible process. ‘
The Comfortable; Status Quo ‘

« Second, students join in the general worship of
the status quo, a veneration encouraged by a gov-
ernment convinced that the little things. are more
important than the big things, Little things are
conspicuous consumption and personal comfort for
those already. comfortable’. =

Big -things are national growth in vital indus-
tries, a greater provision for those not now par-
ticipating in the boom of prosperity, a more dis-
interested program of assistance to ‘the poorly- -

‘ labeled “uncommitted, underdeveloped countries.”

There is an aura of beatiﬁc faith about the

workings of the government, almost a mechanistic
belief that". we‘ are doing all theright things .be- '
cause it "would, in ‘fact, be impossible for us to do
-the wrong things. Progress‘ is equalgto pleasure,
not to invention. Far be it from a student to deny
our wealth. and strength. .

This brings me to the third and most..imp_or-tant>--'=
reason, as that applies most directly to this’ uni-
versity. I/will examine it at some length in the

only persons who would-_ handle‘ '

such matters. The papernever

was informed by the committee

of any of its meetings.
(Second, Mr. lgohrentz has to

be considered incorrect when he;“*

says we were unco-operativein
printing subsequent information
of the availability o_f petitions.
On Jan. .13, the main headline
in the paper read, “Election

.Petitiojns Available on Friday.”

(From that time until peti-
tions were ‘due, notices concern-
ing both individual and party‘
petitions appeared iniﬁve of the

-six issues. The dates of these

were Jan. 13, 20, 25, 27 and
Feb. 1. '
(The editor of this paper, as

a member of the 1959 Electionsgr

Committee, found it necessary to
issues which
came before the committee. In
three of these, two late indivi-
dual petitions and one late party
petition, he voted not to allow
the petitions. The petitions were
those of the Allied Collegiate
Party.

(He also was a member of the
editorial board of this paper
which voted unanimously to en-
dorse J. Kent Jarrell, a PAP

member, for the SGA presi--g

dency. Thus, Mr. Lohrentz has
interpreted these various decis-
ions to show that the editor was
an “ardent supporter” of the
PAP Party.

(Finally, this paper realizes
that under SGA, the Elections
Committee chairman had to be
a member of the governing
body. However, under the new
constitution anyone may be-

selected. to serve as committee

chainnap. There are many sen-"
iors from whom the president
the student body can chooserfor

man.) . ‘~

Disdain Study

"Contempt. of Congress” is the
title of the newly published book
by Dr. Carl S. Beck of the Poli-
tical Science Department and sen-
ior research /associate of the Ad-
ministrative Science Center at the
university.

The _ ﬁrst systematic study of
contempt of Congressional cita-
tions, Dr. Beck’s book is an ex-
amination of the way in which
Congress has exercised its power
to prosecute witnesses for refus-
ing to comply with demands of its
investigatory ‘committees. -

Although fourteen select and
permanent -congressional commit-
tees initiated contempt proceed-
ings in the period 1945-57, thema-
jority of these citations arose from
investigations undertaken by the
committee on Unamerican Activi-
ties of the House of Representa-
tives. '

The Usage of the contempt

tivities Committee serves as the
nucleus of Dr. Beck’s study.

Dr. Beck includes in his work
a record of all contempt citations
since 1795, and a case study of
those initiated by the Unamerican
Activities Committee from 1947-
57. '

The study. constitutes .a perti-

in the conﬂict of “individual lib-

“subversive activities.” '

.NYU Bows, 36-0, Spartans’ Next

 

Matmen Seek Win Tonight

The North bound Panthers are running into dangerousO

territory tonight when they invade the snow ‘covered cam-

pus of Michigan State. Rex

Beery’s matmen are seeking

their ﬁrst win of the year against the undefeated Spartans.
Peery rates Michigan State in the same classras the
University of Michigan, which handed the Panthers their

--only setback of the year. How-6

ever, he felt that the Cats should
have beaten Michigan and have a
good chance of upsetting L the
Spartans.

The-two classes in’which State
seems to be the strongest are the
123 and 137 pound divisions. Dick
Martin and Daryl Kelvington will
face Michigan’s" Glenn Hobes and
Norman Young respectively.

A Cats in-Workout

The meet tonight with Michigan

State will ‘be the second ‘within

. three days for the Peerymen. But

the match with NYU Saturday can
hardly be . termed more than a
light workout for the Panthers. as

. they swept. every weight class to

register their ﬁrst shutout of the
year, 36-0. As a matterof fact,
after the meet most of the team
went down‘ to the wrestling room
and worked out.
While winning their ﬁfth of
the year the Panthers scored five
"pins over weak NYU. One of
those pins did not count be-
cause NYU’s man was over-
weight and so the match was a
forfeit.

checkered woql shirt on a Washington or Idaho mountain
top. - Wednesday could be a collar-and-tie day. ‘

Dick is a- transmission engineerwith the Paciﬁc Tele-
, i phone and Telegraph Company in Seattle, Washington. He ‘

joined the company in June, 1956, after getting his.B.S.E.E. ' C

’ degree ‘from Washington State University. “I wanted to
work in Washington,” he says, “with an established, grow-
ing company where I could ﬁnd a variety of engineering op-
portunities and could use some imagination in my work."

Dick spent 2% years in rotational,on-the-j ob training,
doing power and equipment engineering and “learning the
business.” Since April, 1959, he has worked with micro-
wave radio relay systems in the Washington-Idaho area.‘

' When Dick breaks out his checkered shirt, he’s headed‘

facilities which provide a vital communications link be-
tween radar sites and Air Force Operations. “ '

A current assignment is a new 11,000 me radio route
from central Washington into Canada, utilizing reﬂectors
on mountains ,and repeaters (ampliﬁers) in valleys. It’s a

million-dollar-plus project.

“I don’t know where an engineer could‘ ﬁnd more inter-

esting work,” says Dick.’
