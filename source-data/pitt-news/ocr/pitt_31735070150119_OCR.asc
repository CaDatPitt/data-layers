In a Downtown rally, former presi-
dent Bill Clinton lauded President
Barack Obama’s performance as
commander in chief during Hur-
ricane Sandy, which devastated the
East Coast last week, saying that

"alone gives him the edge over Re-

publican presidential nominee Mitt
Romney in today’s election.

“To me, the election is fairly
simple  I think it’s the candidate
that got off the campaign trail and
went to work on Hurricane Sandy
with Democrats and Republicans
alike,” Clinton said to a crowd that
ﬁlled Market Square on a cold Mon-
day morning.

   

Polls on the eve before Election

Clinton gives last—e pit for ama

Day are showing a neck-and-neck
race as the two candidates ﬁght for

the necessary 270 electoral.votes -

that will seal a victory.

His stop in Pittsburgh comes
after Romney’s campaign placed
a new emphasis on Pennsylvania,
which holds 20 electoral college
votes. The state was previously
considered a lock for Democrats.

Republicans started running
ads’ in the Keystone State the ﬁnal
week of the campaign, and Romney
campaigned there Sunday. No Re-
publican presidential candidate has
carried the state in nearly a quarter
century.

Clinton spoke to the audience on
issues that speciﬁcally affect Pitts-
burgh voters. He praised the city

 

for rebuildng a new economy that

 

   

was based on health care, nanotech-
nology, information technology, ‘
ﬁnancial services and education.

“You are diversifying this econ-
omy by working together,” Clinton
said.

‘ Focusing on Pittburgh’s com-
munity colleges and universities, he
said Obama has sought to increase
the amount of workers with special-
ized training beyond high school
throughout his ﬁrst term.

“He’s revolutionized the student
loan reform bill  now students can
borrow the money at lower interest
rates and pay it back starting the
next year at a small percentage of
their income for up to 20 years,”
Clinton said.

While some students are struggling
to determine which candidate to vote
for in today’s election, those who are
votingfor the ﬁrst time may feel extra
pressure from a lack of experience
with the voting process.

Some ﬁrst—time voters, such as

. freshmanjared Muehlbauer, are un-

certain about the procedure.

“I don’t really know how the ac-
tual voting process works,” admitted
Muehlbauer.

The polls will be open from? am.

Robert Beecher, the governmental
relations committee chairman for Stu-
dent Government Board, explained
how to vote so students can feel more
conﬁdent entering the polls_.

Beecher recommends students set
aside 30 to.45 minutes to vote.

“It all depends on the time of day,

and if they go to one of the polling

locations on campus,” he said. “This
election has a lot of publicity, so I deﬁ-

nitely anticipate lines and hopefully .

We’ll wéatherthe weatherwhatever the weather,
whether we like it or not. Well, unless you’re a
Democrat on a rainy election day.

Mark Rom, an associate professor in the
Department of Government at Georgetown Uni-
versity, says that it’s “conventional wisdom”
that bad weather helps Republicans and hurts
Democrats.

According to Rom, Democratic voters are
generally more easily “dissuaded,” and bad
weather prevents them from going out to vote
more often than Republicans.

But this shouldn’t be the case for voters
in Pittsburgh in this year’s election. Accord-
ing to WTAE meteorologist Demetrius Ivory,
Pittsburgh should expect a “nice and sunny”
Tuesday, with a high of about 49 or 50 degrees.

“Tomorrow should be good weather for
Democratic voters,” Ivory said.

Even if the weather is bad, Paul Supowitz,
vice chancellor for government relations at Pitt,
doesn’t believe it will have a signiﬁcant effect
on voter turnout.

Not only does he feel that students will vote
regardless ofbad weatherbecause Pitt’s polling
places are indoors, but he also believes that the
student voters this year are eager to vote.

“The students this year are pretty motivat-
ed,” Supowitz said. “They’ll be able to tough

lather shouldn’t be deterrent Tﬁéiéﬁﬁ

it ou ”

Because polling locations are close by, easily
accessible and indoors, the University doesn’t
have the same protocol as other voting locations
in case of harsh weather, Supowitz said.

Typically at other polling locations, Supowitz
said, rides are arranged so thatvoters can easily
get to polling locations if the weatherisbad. This
isn’t the case for the University’s polling places.

“Every polling place handles things differ-
ently,” Supowitz said.

Although weathercanaffectvoter turnout, it
only does so “by a couple points,” according to
Rom. Because multiple factors go into deciding
the outcome of an election, the weather’s impact
might not be felt that greatly, Rom said.

Rom also points out that bad weather has
a greater effect on voter turnout in lopsided
elections more than it does in very competitive
elections.

John Sides, anassociate professor of political
science at George Washington University, agrees
with this point.

“Weather can depress voter turnout, but it
doesn’t do so in competitive elections,” Sides
said.

According to Sides, during lopsided elec-
tions, bad weather is more likely to cause voters
to not vote because the outcome can be easily
predicted. However, during competitive elec-
tions, voters are more motivated to get to the
polls, and this cancels out any effect that bad

weather could have.

This might have not been the case during
the 2000 election. According to a research
paper titled “The Republicans Should Pray
for Rain: Weather, Turnout, and Voting in U.S.
Presidential Elections,” by associate professor
Brad Gomez of the University of Georgia, Pitt
professor George Krause and associate pro-
fessor Thomas Hansford, of the University of
California-Merced, badweatherhas swung close
elections in the past.

According to data presented in the research
paper, if it hadn’t rained at all in Florida during
the 2000 election, more Democrats might have

come out to vote for Democratic hopeful Al’

Gore, potentially causing him to win the state.
Although “a number of otherfactors  may have
affected the Florida outcome,” the weather could
have completely swung an already extremely
close election into Gore’s favor.

Although 'Duesday’s forecast looks mild,the
aftermath ofHurricane Sandy could potentially
affect voter turnout in northeastern states. Al-
though it might be affected in those states most
affected by Hurricane Sandy, such as New York
and Newjersey, Sides doesn’t believe this will
have a major impact on the outcome of the elec-
tion, because both states are strong supporters
of President Barack Obama.

“The outcome isn’t in doubt,” Sides said.
“Hurricane Sandy will not affect overall out-
come.” I

a large student tumout. But if students go into
the polls informed, we should be able to keep
the lines down.”

Beecher said that when students arrive at
their polling location, they’ll wait in line to sign
in. He also said that if they’re ﬁrst-time voters,
they’ll be askedto show ID. However, this doesn’t
necessarily mean photo ID.

“TheID canbe somethingas simple as autility
bill with their name on it,” Beecher said.

Other forms of ID include a Pitt ID, current
bank statement, current paycheck, U.S. passport,
Pennsylvania driver’s license or PennDOT ID
card, or employee ID. p

A’ Beecherwent onto say that afterthe students
sign in, they will be directed to a booth with a
voting machine inside. Atthe William Pitt Union,
there will be 14voting machines set up that have
already been calibrated. Students can then cast
their vote straight-ticket or select individual can-
didates on the touch screen

Beecher wanted to stress the importance of
students voting early.

‘ “The polls will stay open until everyone in line
has voted, but it is important that students vote
as early as possible,” Beecher said.

Some students, such as freshmen Emily Fri-
gon and Caroline Owens, feel conﬁdent about
what to expect at the polls tomorrow.

“I’ve gone with my parents before,” Frigon

said. “I just don’t know who I’m going to pick  -

It’s going to be a tough decision,” Owens added.

Former President Biil Clinton meets supporters in Marliet Square after his speech sup-

porting President Barack Obama. Zach Schaffer | Staff Photographer

Pitt sophomore Emily Maccia said she
valued Clinton’s insight on Obama’s plan for
the federal student loan program.

“It’s very interesting, things that are not
said until you come to a rally. I learned things
about the election that I didn’t already know
about student loans and other political is-
sues,” Maccia said.

Point Park University sophomore Katy Al-
bert agreed with Maccia, saying that the por-
tion of Clinton’s speech dedicated to higher
education intrigued her. ,

“He spoke a lot to the college community
and made a lot of great points for student
voters to consider,” Albert said.

Pittsburgh has been a hot spot for can-
didates this election season. Romney is re-
portedly making his ﬁnal campaign stop in
Pittsburgh tomorrow before waiting out the
election results in Boston. Further details
have not been released. His last Pennsylva-
nia campaign stop was in Bucks County on
Sunday.

Obama made a campaign stop at Carn-
egie Mellon University during the summer.
Jill Biden, vice president Joe Biden’s wife,
also made a stop in Pittsburgh last month,
where she highlighted the accomplishments
of Obama and her husband.

Republican Vice Presidential candidate
Paul Ryan campaigned in August at _a steel
mill, and then he made a short speech toward
the end of October at an airport rally in Moon
Township. H

Clinton also stressed the need for women’s
equality in the workplace, bringing the audi-
ence back to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act
of 2009, which was the ﬁrst bill signed into

V law by Obama after his initial election.

“Equal ‘pay for equal work is not just a
women’s issue. Every 200 households has
a man there who wants his wife to get equal
pay for equal work, because it’s better for the
kids,” Clinton said.

The former president was introduced to
the stage by Democratic state Rep. Mark Critz,

who excited the Pittsburgh crowd by wearing ~

a Pittsburgh Steelers jersey. Critz faces re-

election against businessman Keith Rothfus
today in Pennsylvania’s 12th District.

State Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Allegheny, also
participated in the rally and generated en-
thusiasm among members of the crowd by
chanting “ﬁred up, ready to go” as he entered
the stage. Doyle encouraged the crowd to
stand up for a man who supports the middle
and working class by making sure to vote in
the election.

“Pittsburgh, tomorrow is a big election,”
Doyle said. “This is going to decide the future
of our country.”

Richard Trumka, president of both the
American Federation of Labor and the Con-
gress of Industrial Organizations, encouraged
voters to vote for the whole Democratic ticket,
and not just the presidential candidates.

“It’s time for us to win again with President
Obama, Vice President [Joe] Biden, Sen. [Bob]
Casey, Rep. Mark Critz and Attorney General
Kathleen Kane,” Trumka said.

Clinton concluded the rally by reminding
members of the audience of the implications
of today’s election for the nation’s future.

“Tomorrow, if you vote for your hopes and
not your fears, if you vote for unity and not for
division, if you think we can all go together,
then you will re—elect Barack Obama president
of the United States,” Clinton said. I

To the editor,

The article “Religion plays role in
voting” missed an important demo-
graphicwhen discussingthe religious
views of voters and the inﬂuence of
religion onvoting. Therewas no com-
mentary discussing religiously unaf-
filiated voters or voters who identify
as atheists.

Current polling data would sug-
gest that 19 percent of Americans are
unaffiliated with a church, including
6 percent of Americans who identify
as either atheists or agnostics. These
groups have been growingrapidly (an
additional4percent ofthe population

, /~ _.—«. «<" >—v« M... "i*>” ,'.,.-~.. .........,,., .. .- ’—.— H

in just the last ﬁve years) and illus-
trate a change in the way Americans
view the proper relation between
religion and government.

This also presents an important
challenge to politicians: how to man-
age the traditionally religious voting
blocks they need votes from without
disenfranchising voters who don’t
want to hear about the Bible during
a political debate.

Exploring consequences of voter
  apathy: Are We jaded and uninformed?

Nick Stamatakis and Rosie McKinley
The Pitt News Stcyff

Voters younger than 30 don’t seem
to care much about this election;
only 18 percent say they are fol-
lowing campaign news very close-
ly, according to the Pew Research
Center. The situation is bipartisan,
with young Democrats and young
Republicans both showing declin-
ing enthusiasm since 2008. Why is
this, and is it a bad thing?

Nick Stamatakis: I think there
are two reasons why enthusi-
asm is so far down. For one, the
candidates this year have built
their careers around never do-
ing anything too unexpected or
brash. Former Massachusetts Gov.
Mitt Romney probably picks his
clothes out weeks in advance and
approaches every decision with
businessman-like methodology,
not idealogical vigor. And Presi-
dent Barack Obama, while an
enticing candidate, is completely
incapable of selling overarching
principles with any conviction: Big
Bird and “Romnesia” don’t exactly
get people excited.

But more important is our gen-
eration’s fashionable cynicism. Ev-
erybody acts so jaded. Just because
Barack Obama didn’t ﬁx things at
once, we give up? Throwing our
hands up is understandable when
we are 80, not 22.

Rosie McKinley: With the ex-
ception of 2008, voter apathy
among young people has been a
trend in the U.S. for a long time,
so we can’t blame it on this year’
particular candidates. '

We are an incredibly busy gen-
eration. More of us go to college,
more of us volunteer, and with
the passage of Title IX, more of

us play sports than members of
any generation prior. Meanwhile,
with millions of people voting in
the election this November, we
may feel statistically insigniﬁcant.
What’s the point of taking time out
of our busy schedule to cast a vote
that doesn’t really matter?

We are also told that “Big Bird”
issues are silly. Instead, we are told
that to cast a meaningful vote re-
quires us to understand the com-
plicated intricacies of the housing
market or foreign relations. We
begin to feel that we are too igno-
rant of the “real” issues to vote.
But we are too busy studying for
our physics midterms to study up
on the election. We don’t have time
to study all the issues.

Since we feel ignorant about
complicated issues that suppos-
edly really matter, and Big Bird
issues aren’t important enough

i for a serious person, we never feel

prepared to vote. So most of us
don’t.

NS: I don’t buy the excuse that
young people are too busy. In
1960, the average college student
spent 40 hours a week studying;
today, we only spend 27 hours. We
aren’tjam-packed with activities.
And with the Internet, it doesn’t
need to take a long time to study
up on candidates. The 1960s

student needed to wade through ‘

stacks of newspapers. Today, we
only need a web browser.

But your point about students
feeling ignorant is interesting. I
have heard frequently that people
don’t know who to vote for, so they
just won’t. There are two reasons
for this, as far as I can tell. Either

sources for information are less
reliable, and ﬁnding “truth” is
more confusing, or people today
are just more lazy and don’t want
to put in the mental work to decide
where they stand on the issue.

RM: I think it’s true that we
don’t have the same motivation
to go out and ﬁnd the “truth” sur-
rounding the issues like genera-
tions previous. But I don’t agree
that it’s because our generation
is inherently lazy, so addicted
to computers and reality televi-
sion that we care more about who
punches Snooki this week than
we do about rhetorical punches
thrown in presidential debates.

I suppose it is more our feeling
that our vote just really doesn’t
matter. For one, because of the Su-
preme Court’s Citizens United rul-
ing, multi-million dollar corpora-
tions can contribute to campaigns
in the same manner as individual
citizens. How can I feel like I’m
making a meaningful contribu-
tion to a campaign by canvassing

‘ or making phone calls when the

other players are so big? It’s hard
to care about democracy when

you know it’s being distorted by-

corporations far more powerful
than individual voters. Why com-
pete when you know the political
winners will ultimately just be the
biggest economic players?

NS: But the problem you just
stated could actually be solved
if people paid more attention. If
money really does buy elections
(and it probably doesn’t: Steven

THE RIVETER

Who run the world? Why Beyonce is
wrong about women in government

~ 'lRosie McKinley
Columnist

I like attention. So beingawoman this
election season has really been quite
decadent. Every candidate, political
pundit and excitable blogger has been
talking about the importance of my
vote. Turn on CNN, Fox News or any
other news network and you might
start thinking that elections are de-
cided with our vaginas rather than
our minds. i

All this attention on the so-called

women’s vote — as though it is one ’

congruous block —- raises the great-
est irony of this election season. In
an election that has largely revolved
around women and the importance
of ourvote, there are surprisingly few
women actually running or already
holding governing power.

Across all branches of govern-

ment, women are underrepresented.
Female troops represent just 14.6 per-
cent of the American military. Just
three of our nine Supreme Court
Justices are women, which reﬂects
the disproportionately low number
of women at all levels of our federal
judicial system.

Most jarring and relevant for to-
day’s elections is the shockingly small
number of women in the American
legislature at both state and national
levels. *‘ "

Only 16.9 percent of our national

 legislature is composed of women.
. For comparison, Rwanda’s national

legislature is made up of more than
50 percent women, and the average
for national legislatures globally is
19.3 percent women. "

Places as far—ﬂung as Germany,
India and Brazil have elected women
to their highest govemingposts while
we’re stuck clinging to memories of
failed campaigns by Sarah Palin and
Geraldine Ferraro as disappointing
landmarks of American women’s

advancement toward political power.

And while we do have Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton as one impres-
sive example of the work American
women can accomplish in govem-
ment, even she is haunted by a side
story about her gender. Her brilliant
career will always be asterisked by a
role as the mere supporting character
in her husband’s juicy sex scandal in
the Oval Oﬂice.

Where are we, women?

Currently there are only 17 female
senators. Even if all female senatorial
candidates wintoday — which would
be a major and unlikely political vic-
tory forthe gender— women would
make up just 22 percent of the Senate.
In a stroke of good news, a record-
high number of women are running
for the House of Representatives. But
even if many of them win, women in
America will still be far underrep-
resented in the national legislature.

The situation is even bleaker at the
gubernatorial level. There are merely
six female governors for all 50 states.
Depending on today’s election in New
Hampshire, that number could fall to
four. Meanwhile, in our proud state of
Pennsylvania, there has never been a
female U.S. senator or governor.

This lack of women in American
government is not due to a lack of
qualiﬁcation. On the contrary, women
are increasingly more qualiﬁed than
our male counterparts. For the ﬁrst
time ever, we make up a larger part
of the workforce. We are going to col-
lege and getting advanced degrees at
higher rates thanAmerican men, and
many of these degrees are in ﬁelds
that typically lend themselves to po-
litical careers — the majority of law
students are women.

The underrepresentation is also
not because we are waiting for the
political world to catch up with the
number of women taking leading
positions in the academic and eco-

nomic spheres. Exactly two decades
ago this week, Americans celebrated
as the number of women in the Senate
tripled. Dubbed as “The Year of the
Woman,” 1992 sparked a decade of
increased political representation by
women. Two years later, 34 women
ran for governor. But by 2001, the
number of women in power seemed
to plateau. Over the last 10 years,
we’ve experienced stagnation in

governing power, even as women

continue to become increasingly

Relying on men to solve society’s

us with a campaign season like this
one, overwhelmingly dominated by
outrageously misleading claims about

just one indication of the good work
male legislators — the president, in

more women were campaigning, we
could have more intelligible discus-
sion on the dubious effectiveness
of reproductive rights restrictions,
the insuﬂicient legislation insuring
maternity care and other social in-

Think about it. Who is more

saying Obama is a communist: the
informed voter who did a little bit
of homework, or the person too
busy and disillusioned to look up
communism on Wikipedia? A na-

But the fact of the matter is,
the messages created by super
PACs and disseminated by the TV
commercials or advertisements
they buy are more complicated
than outrageous, obviously untrue

evidence suggesting that negative

Now I’d like to believe that most
Pitt students are knowledgeable
enough to know that these at-
tack ads are only partially based
in truth. Nevertheless, to under-
stand them frilly (so as to not feel
ignorant), we’d have to devote
considerable time away from our
studies or exhausting jobs at Chi-
potle. That’s a decision most of us
can’t afford to make.

NS: See, that does sound a bit
like whining to me. We don’t actu-
ally need to do fact checking on ev-
erything; that would be impossible
and time consuming. Even most
media organizations don’t have
the resources for that anymore.

But people should be able to

loosely identify with a general

governing philosophy, if nothing
else. And it should be expected
that people be smart enough, civic
enough and interested enough to
have some small concept of gov-

ernment. You can work at Chipotle’

RM: Loosely identify with a
general governing philosophy?
Even the very association between
political party and governing phi-
losophy is convoluted by campaign
rhetoric. The GOP claims to be
anti—government involvement,
but then pushes for government
invasion of the most private of
women’s rights. Meanwhile, the
Democrats advertise their party
as environmentally friendly, even
as Obama has paid little attention
to green energy in this campaign.
Any way you spin it, national elec-
tions are hard to understand.

So, I’d rather those people who
struggle to choose between Qdoba

all, rather than vote for whichever
party they mistakenly thought
best represented their interests
because they were too uninformed
to know the difference. I

News obsession drove Warhol’s work, exhibition portrays art

“Warhol: Headlines"

The Andy Warhol Museum
Oct. 14 through Jan. 6
wvvw.warhol.org

Not many people — even art enthu-
siasts — know that Andy Warhol
was a news junkie.

The Andy Warhol Museum
opened a new exhibit on the pop
artist’s obsession with contempo-
rary news media on Oct. 14. The ex-
hibition, titled “Warhol: Headlines,”
features more than 80 works that
represent Warhol’s key obsessions,
including celebrity, death, disaster
and current events.

“‘Headlines’ combines Warhol’s
love for newspapers and pop-cu1-
ture references,” Emily Meyer, the
assistant communications manager
at The Warhol, said.

Although the artist’s love of news
has always been a major theme at
The Warhol Museum on the North
Shore, there has never been a ma-
jor exhibition to further examine
how deep this journalistic obsession
goes. Warhol’s entire arsenal of ar-
tistic methods is on display in this

new exhibit, including paintings,
drawings, photography, sculptures
and ﬁlm.

Some of Warhol’s showcased
works are “A Boy for Meg,” “Daily
News (1962),” and “129 Die in ajet.”
Warhol depicted stories of celebrity

joy, celebrity scandal and everyday
tragedy in his art.

“Warhol: Headlines,” which is
organized by the National Gallery
of Art in Washington, D.C., debuted
in the nation’s capital last fall. Since
then, the exhibition has traveled
overseas with help from The Terra
Foundation for American Art, an
international art sponsor.

Last spring, “Headlines” was
on display at Museum fur Moderne
Kunst in Frankfurt, Germany, before
it spent the summer at the Galleria
Nazionale d’Arte Moderna in Rome.

The exhibit has made its way
back to the United States and is clos-
ing out its world tour in Pittsburgh,
where its artist grew up. Warhol —
who was born Andrej Varchola Jr.
but later had his name American-
ized to Andrew Warhola —, lived at
3252 Dawson St. in South Oakland
while growing up. For his collegiate

studies, he originally intended
to enroll at Pitt, but instead

COLUMN

Television takes stance on politics during election season

Anna Weldon
Impulse Editor

It’s Election Day, and it seems like
everyone —— even ﬁctional charac-
ters — is excited to vote.

Various television series make
indirect attempts to support a par-
ticular candidate in the presiden-
tial elections through subtle hints
and extreme characters.

Though it’s not uncommon for
public ﬁgures to endorse candi-
dates for the presidency, it seems
that TV shows take on barely hid-
den agendas. Silently casting their

ballot through ﬁctional characters, A

television series have a fairly large
impact on theirlviewers.

A clear example of these obvi-
ous endorsements comes in NBC’s
“The New Normal”  a series
that takes a look at how society is
evolving in relation to the nuclear
family.

“The New Normal” is a_ show
that follows David (Justin Bartha)
and Bryan (Andrew Rannells), a
gay couple that wants to have a

child, and Goldie (Georgia King)
and Shania Clemmons (Bebe
Wood), a mother and daughter
who move to Los Angeles to escape
the suffocating clutches of their
small—town home in Ohio. The two
families are changed forever when
Goldie agrees to become a surro-
gate mother for David and Bryan,
and their lives intertwine in every

» possible way.

On Sept. 25, NBC aired an epi-
sode called “Obama Mama” — a
clear attempt at using words to
indicate a political statement.

. Goldie’s grandmother, Jane (Ellen

Barkin), acts like a bigot through-
out the show, consistently deriding
David and Bryan’s relationship, as
well as people of other races.

In this episode, the cast focuses
on the presidential candidates:
former Gov. Mitt Romney and
President Barack Obama. There
is little reference to third-party
candidates. A

Jane publicly states her po-
litical opinion throughout the
show, making it obvious that she

will be voting for Romney. And
Bryan, who has a much more lib-
eral agenda, has come out against
Jane’s opinion to support Obama
—- a stage for TV-constructed ten-
sion that resonates throughout the
show.

Shania’s elementary class stages
a mock election that incorporates
poll booths and secret ballots. Af-
ter an entire episode of grilling her
with important political informa-
tion on the elections, she makes a
decision to vote for Obama based
off social issues in relation to David
and Bryan’s relationship.

Bryan, who is obviously thrilled,
asks Goldie who she plans to vote
for. In any attempt to remain ambig-
uous, Goldie refuses to respond,
saying that anonymous voting is
“the point of a true democracy.”
Though the couple respects her

. decision to be vague, Bryan quickly

adds, “Blink once for Obama, twice
for the Mormon.” With an exasper-
ated look, Goldie turns away just as
the camera ﬂashes to David, who
blinks twice, signaling to no one

other than the observant viewer
that he will vote for Romney.

Though the moment is subtle
and discreet, it still makes an ob-
vious attempt at one of the char-
acters’ endorsing the Republican
candidate without overtly say-
ing it. Unlike Jane, who can’t go
through an entire episode without
making a conservative comment
bordering on racism and bigotry,
David never proclaims himself a
Republican and frequently agrees
with his partner’s political views.

But this endorsement is more
than just a supposed liberal char-
acter favoring Romney. It takes a
current event — the election —
and applies it to the lives of the
characters in this progressive TV
show. It’s not new for TV to utilize
the election in a series’ production,
but it is important.

Though the show has disap-
pointed many viewers for its unre-
alistic character portrayals, it still
makes a statement. Other shows,
such as “Saturday Night Live,”
poke fun at the presidential can-

didates. Parodies of the debates,
as well as individual interviews
and announcements, including
Obama’s address to the country
regarding hurricane Sandy, don’t
discriminate in their hysterical —
and somewhat offensive — repre-

sentations of the candidates. Even '

“3O Rock” made a political state-
ment, with a debate between two
characters in a recent episode that
made jokes about the candidates.

The media impacts society’s
views immensely, and though not
every American voter has seen
this speciﬁc episode of “The New
Normal,” those who have seen it
could have been shocked by the
obvious attempt at supporting the
two primary candidates.

obligation to endorse both par-
ties or simply an unexpected
twist, “The New Normal” seems
to have surprised viewers with the
direction of its political material,
proving that a presidential elec-
tion affects everyone — even TV
characters. ﬂ

The Warhol gives Pittsburgh

“The Warhol will include a num-

There are seven pieces of art that
are new to the exhibit. These include
“Flash,” which is a depiction of Rob-
ert Kennedy’s assassination, and
“Andy Warhol Getting a Pedicure,”
which is one of the works Warhol
completed toward the end of his life.

“Headlines” is attracting many

He Americanized his name to Andrew Warhola, and then later became known as

Andy Warhol.

He attended Schenley High School and continued on to Carnegie institute of Tech-

He moved to New York City to follow his dream of becoming a commercial artist,
and during the 19505 and l’60s, he became well known for popular works such as
“Brillo Boxes” and experimental films, including “Chelsea Girls” (1966).

Warhol’s obsession with media began early, and he was famously quoted for saying,
“Don’t pay any attention to what they write about you. Just measure it in inches.”

He died in 1987 and was buried in Pittsburgh.

As the Pitt football team was blow-
ing a 14-point lead at Notre Dame
on Saturday afternoon, the Pitt
volleyball team was suffering its
own collapse.

With a 2-1 set advantage, the
Panthers (14-13, 5-8 Big East) had
the chance to earn the match vic-
tory against South Florida (14-12,

6-7MBigA East)  the fgurth s_e_t_,';
Butttthe B11ll"s stqjrmed back at  ’

the ﬁnal two sets and denying Pitt
what would’ve been a vital confer-

“We had the chance to close

7 out the match, but we just could
7 not ﬁnish,” Pitt sophomore Kate
_, Yeazel said after the loss. “We were
 not able to keep themomentum

on our side and that killed us in
the end.”

Fellow sop_homor__e Jessica
Wynn agreed, adding that in close

' games, every~-point is crucial.

“When the match is close, we

need to be able toﬁght until the 
end to get the ﬁnal points,” Wynn ;

said. “If the score is 20-20, it’s a
game to ﬁve, and we were not able
to get the points when we needed
them.” ' ” A 

The defeat prevented the Pan-
thers from leaping the Bulls in the
Big East standings; both teams are

ﬁghting for one of the eight spots
in the upcoming conference tour-
nament, which will be hosted by
Marquette later in November.

With the comeback victory,
South Florida moved into eighth
place in the Big East, while Pitt
dropped to ninth.

The Panthers started the ﬁrst
set of the match with a 10-6 lead

‘before the Bulls battled back to

force a 22-22 tie. Then, South Flor-
ida used three kills to end the ﬁrst

. set with a victory.

In the second set, the Bulls took

‘ the early 13-9 advantage after a 6-2

scoring run. This time, however,
the Panthers responded by scoring
the next four points to tie the set,
and both teams traded points until
a 20-20 tie was reached. The score
would be tied ﬁve more_ times, but
kills by Wynn and Alex Phillips
ﬁnished the set for Pitt, tying the
match. Phillips set a career-high
record for kills, with 15.

USF held the lead for most of
the third set, but the Panthers
put together a 7-0 run to bring
the score to 24-19, and Phillips
recorded another kill to bring the
set to a close and give the Panthers
the 2-1 set advantage. V

But Pitt failed to ﬁnish off the
match victory in the next set, al-
lowing the Bulls to cruise to a 25-19
fourth-set win. if

The ﬁfth and ﬁnal set — played
to 15 —— saw South Floridajufnp

out to a 6-1 lead that it never relin-
quished. The Panthers closed the
gap to 14-12, but a kill by the Bulls
ended both the set and the match.

“This match was an emotional
roller coaster,” Wynn said. “There
were so many momentum chang-
es, and in the future, we need to
keep our mental focus and push
to close out games.”

In the match, the Bulldogs held
the higher hitting clip throughout

the contest and also out-blocked

the Panthers, 21-10. For the Pan-
thers, blocking is something that
will continue to be a focus going
forward.

“We emphasize blocking a lot
in practice,” junior outside hitter
Monica Wignot said. “It has im-
proved, but we have to continue
working on blocking, especially
in one-on-one situations.”

Olfensively, Wynn led the Pan-
thers in kills with 19, while Alexa
Campbell and Yeazel added 15 and
14, respectively.

Senior libero Margy Acton re-

. corded 20 digs on defense, and

Delaney Clesen added 13. With her
performance, Acton moved into

Lakers, Thunder 0

{‘ Isaac Saul
Senior Sta_/jf Wrz'ter

The NBA__season is young, but it’s
never too to start speculating.
After less than two weeks. of
games, questions and concerns have
already begun to rise for teams. New
acquisitions have made their mark,
and team chemistry is beginning to
take form. With 70-some games left
to go in the season, it’s time to start
talking about what we’ve seen from
some big-name teams.
Los Angeles Lakers _
After starting the season 0-3, the
mediahawks began‘ to swarm Los
Angeles withéqquestioris‘ about the

ﬁltufe Wasthé blarkléustsr. deéiais
acquire star center Dwight Howard ‘

a bust? Was point guard Steve Nash
too old and too injury-prone? Had

Kobe Bryant lost a step? Would the

Lakers make the playoffs?

Of course, these ideas were fool-
ish. - "

The Lakers (1-3) had trouble get-
ting their ﬁrst win, but when they
dominated the Pistons 108-79 on
Monday night, they began to look
like the top-tier team their roster
implicates. Even without Nash, one

— of the greatest point guards of all

time, the Lakers managed to have
four players in double—digit scor-
ing and tallied 27 assists total on the
night. With Howard going for 28,
Bryant 15, Metta World Peace 18 and

l 1 Pan Gasol14, the Lakers proved they
‘are’o'1?ie‘ of the few teams who can

A maintain an incredibly balanced and

potent scoring attack, even without
a starter on the ﬂoor.

However, if I were a fan of the
Lakers, I would deﬁnitely keep
my eye on Nash’s fractured tibula
and the overall health of the aging
38-year-old star.

Brooklyn Nets

Although we’ve only gotten one
look at this relocated franchise, the
ﬁrst impression was a good one.

The Nets looked motivated, tal-
ented and athletic in their 107-100
win over the Raptors. Even more,
everyone seemed to be doing what
they were supposed to do. Fran-
chise point guard Deron Williams
recorded nine assists, young center
Brook Lopez showed why he is one

of the next big things on his way to
27 points and ﬁve rebounds, small
forward Gerald Wallace showed off
his defensive ability with two steals
and lockdown defense and newly
acquired shooting guardjoejohnson
recorded 14 points, ﬁve rebounds
and four assists in 40 minutes.

With this kind of team effort,
the Nets (1-0) could be a challenger
against anyone.

'Miami Heat

It looks as though the defending-
champion Heat (2-1) are picking up
right where they left off last season.

With the exception of their loss
to the highly motivated New York
Knicks —— playing in the wake of
Hurricane Sandy — the Heat have
looked incredibly powerful both

ffto shaky  in N BA’s opening weeks 

on defense and offense. It’s tough
to imagine a team like this being
stronger than it was last year, but

with the signing of an experienced .3?

pure shooter like Ray Allen, the Heat
might actually be a more complete
team.
Oklahoma City Thunder

The Thunder are going through
one of the most interesting transi-

tions in the league after giving up“

James Harden to the Houston Rock-
ets. Harden, who was the Sixth Man
of the Year last season, completed
the young-gun trio with Kevin Du-

three of them all ﬁnished in the tolxga,

—— Washington’s team name.

The newspaper defended its policy and
explained why other news organizations
should adopt it.

“I remain unconvinced by every argu-
ment I’ve ever heard that the name is not
a racial epithet, plain and simple,” Derek
Donovan, public editor of the Star, wrote.
“And I’ll even break my usual rule about
commenting on issues outside the Star’s
journalism to say that I ﬁnd it inconceivable
that the NFL still allows such a patently of-
fensive name and mascot to represent the
league in 2012.”

Donovan would go on to say it is not
“healthy” that this word still exists.

The term “redskin” is a dirty label based
on race. White settlers in western colonies
used the label to describe the skin tone of
the natives. Later on, these settlers would
use the word to count the number of Native
American scalps collected by trappers. The
term developed into a derogatory distinc-
tion between the former Europeans and the
American Indians.

Does that story sound familiar in mod-
ern—day times? Words like “colored” and
“negro” were used as derogatory distinc-
tions as well, but you don’t see the San Fran-
cisco Negroes taking the ﬁeld every Sunday,
do you?

The Native American population is one
of the smallest minorities in the country.
It is hard for them to gain the support of a
majority opinion. It should not be a matter of
majority support, but should be considered
as an ethical, empathetic situation that can
easily be solved.

Native Americans have been used as

mascots since the early days of sports, yet

“redskin” stands out as the most offensive
depiction.

Football fans overlook the racial issue
and proceed to support Washington’s team
name.

I feel the problem with Washington’s
name goes deeper than racism. It reﬂects
negatively on our nation as a whole. Since
Washington is our country’s capital, other
professional sports teams in the city have
adopted names such as the Senators, Dip-
lomats, Capitals and Nationals.

Washington’s NBA team — the Wizards
—— used to be called the Bullets. However,
the franchise announced its name change
in 1995 due to the heightened sensitivity of
gunviolence in the city.

This is the same problem that is happen-
ing with the Redskins. It is just not right to
have our nation’s capital portraying a ﬁgure
in our history that we degraded and shoved
into a closed section of our society.

What our nation did to this land’s natives
was inhumane, and is not something we
should celebrate every time Washington’s
football team scores a touchdown.

So if Native Americans feel offended by
our nation’s capital degrading their eth-
nicity in professional sports, everyone else
should, too.

The day after Donovan issued his state-
ment, ESPN’s “Around the Horn” took the
story on in debate. All four members of the
panel from around the country — honor-
able sports writers Jackie MacMullan, Bill
Plaschke, Tim Cowlishaw and Woody Paige
— came to an agreement that the word is
terribly offensive and ESPN should drop it
from its program. ~/

That is exactly what ESPN should do.

As the world’s largest sports network, it
has the power to have a huge inﬂuence over
how the NFL potentially could resolve this

issue. If “redskin” is no longer shown on
SportsCenter, NFL Live and even Monday
Night Football, maybe the fans would realize
that use of this word is wrong.

The appropriateness of Washington’s
name and logo, which is a picture of a Na-
tive American, has been debated since it was
officially registered in 1967.

The debates heated up in 1992, when
Washington made it to the Super Bowl
against the Buffalo Bills. The game was held
in Minnesota, which has the nation’s largest
Native American population.

Prior to the game, more than 2,000 Na-
tive Americans stood outside the stadium
and protested with signs that read, ‘we are
not mascots,” and, “promote sports not rac-
ism.” The American Indian Movement along
with the National Congress of American
Indians Voiced the event.

Shortly afterwards, the issue went to a
district court in Washington. Judges origi-
nally canceled the trademark on the Red-
skins’ name, but it was overturned in ap-
peals seven years later on the basis of laches,
which means the Native Americans did not
pursue their rights in a timely manner.

With a new franchise quarterback in
Robert Griffin III and the offensive style
that head coach Mike Shanahan has put
into place, it is time for Washington to turn
around and adopt a new name.

Now, I have a suggestion: Keep Washing-
ton’s logo and mascot the same, but change
its name to the “Warriors.” This would rep-
resent natives in a positive light without
changing much of the team’s characteristics.

Football fans need to think outside of
the sports world sometimes and realize that
some things that seem so second nature just
were not correct decisions to begin with.

So let’s ﬁx it.

So far, it doesn’t look like the trade has
helped the Thunder (1-2), who are still trying
to ﬁnd their rhythm. It’s early, and there is no
doubt Oklahoma City will be a playoff team,
but if Harden has proven anything since he left
for Houston, it’s that he is an incredible scorer.
Houston Rockets

In the off—season, the Rockets (2-1) pulled
together two of the biggest fan—favorite play-

oz ers in the league by acquiringjeremy Lin and

Harden.

In the Rockets’ ﬁrst three games, Harden
has scored 45, 37 and 24 points for an average
of 35 points per game. He’s shooting 52.9 per-
cent from the ﬁeld and has looked like not just

Ma leader, but a freak talent. As a nice compli-

‘ment, Lin is averaging 15 points, seven assists
and two steals per game.

If the Rockets can continue to get strong’

inside efforts from guys like Omer Asik (av-

eraging more than 14 rebounds per game),
this team could be a deadly dark horse come
playoff time. I

New York Knicks

I don’t know whether it was Hurricane
Sandy or the presence of another team in the
Big Apple, but this Knicks (2-0) team looks
like it has a desire that it hasn’t had in a very
long time.

The Knicks won their opening two games
for the ﬁrst time in 13 years. Carmelo Anthony
is averaging 28.5 points and 7.5 assists per
game, j.R. Smith is putting up 15 points and
six rebounds per game,jason Kidd is running
the show and Ronnie Brewer has been solid
off the bench.

But even with Anthony and the other stars
off to a quick start, the most telling stat about
this Knicks team is the 84 points it’s allowing
per game. This team is playing defense, and
it’s playing it well. If New York can keep that
up, there is no limit to its success —— proven
by the dominant win over the Miami Heat. %
