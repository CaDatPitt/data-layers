Canton University
Carries On Program
Despite Undeclared War

By S. S. KALWARY

Despite Ja.pan’s invasion,
eclucation and the pursuit of
foreign culture still persist in

war-singed China-

(fanton university recently
released the ﬁrst issue of the
Canton University Forum, the
first all-English journal ever to
be published by a Chinese school.
Kwok-Yung Fung, organizer and
director of the University’s Eng-
lish department, is editor of the
new semi-monthly publication.

The connection with Pitt? Mr.
Fung is a Pitt alumnus and in
3.935 received a master of arts de-
gree from the University. Prior
to his graduate work here, he
earned a bachelors degree at Du-
quesne university.

A resident of the states from
l923 to 1937, Mr. Fung devoted
most of his college years to the
study of English and the ﬁne arts.

Teachers Continue

Even without this connection,
the journal is newsworthy. Sent
to Dr. Benjamin H. Williams, pro-
fessor of political science, the pa-
per shows that war-timeielforts of

.Canton university have not en-

tirely blotted out pea
suits. ‘ w

The articles. in the eight-page
publication, are preceded by a
foreword by Canton’s president.
Following President A Ping-Chuan
Chen’s. message’ is Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-Shek’s manifesto,
issued immediately
after the fall of Nanking.

Articles of a peacetime nature
are “The Civil Engineers’ Role in
the Reconstruction of China,”
“The New Courses” and a disser-
tation on “The Poetic Principles
Discussed by Some English Poets.”
Among the four news items is a
feature on Dr. Williagls.

Dr. VVilIiams Honored

This story tells of Dr. Williams’
activities in behalf of China. Ac-
cording to the article, “Dr. Wil-
liams, educator, lecturer and au-
thor, is actively engaged in- the
Emergency Civilian Relief work
which is being conducted by the
Chinese Institute of Pittsburgh in
the United States.”

An interesting sidelight of the
growing popularity of the English
language in the Orient is the story
of the founding of the school’s
English department. In this item
Mr. Fung states, “The (English)
department hopes not only to aid
students in becoming proficient
in reading and writing Engl_ish,
but also fluent in this interesting
and valuable language.”

Concernir/ the use of the new
medium, English, the university’s
president says, “It is the aim . . .
to stimulate the student’s interest
in, and understanding of English

. As this ﬁrst issue goes to
press I cannot but have a feeling
of pride in the fact that the school
I serve is initiating a new project
in spite of the present unsettled
conditions.”

Men’s Health Director

To Explain Procedure
vOf Tuberculosis Test

“Doctors, Dollars, and Dis-
ease,” an interpretation of
group hospitalization, will be
presented by Abraliani‘ Oseroﬁ,
;director of Monteﬁore hospital,
at Inquiry Forum today at
12 :30 o’clock in 129 Cathedral.

In his address, Mr. Oseroff
will attempt to evaluate the aims
of group hospitalization, and will
explain the procedure of the plan
recently inaugurated by the Pitts-
burgh Hospital Service associa-
tion. »

HOSPITALIZATION

Dr. H. Clifford Carlson, direc-
tor of the men’s student health
service, will also speak at Inquiry,
giving a description of the free
Tuberculin tests now being admin-
istered in the drive conducted by
the health s_ervices and The News.

During the past year group hos-
pitalization has been a source of
heated discussion, among members
of the medical profession.

Some opposition to the plan has
come from persons who see in it
a step toward socialized medicine.
Its proponents claim that group
hospitalization will spread the use
of hospital facilities and reduce
the burden on the individual fam-
ily.

MONTHLY PREMIUM

According to the Pittsburgh
Hospital Service association plan,
the person subscribing to the serv-
l ice pays a monthly premium to the
association. If he requires care in
a hospital, he may go to any one
of the 14 Allegheny county merg-

ber hospitals.

The payment of small addition-
al amounts allows the extension
of this service to wives and chil-
dren of persons taking part in the
plan.

The meeting is open to stu-
dents and faculty.

ll RECORD SET‘
, The Tuberculin tests, open only
%to students in the University and
including no faculty members, are
given Mondays, Tuesdays and
Wednesdays; to the men at Falk
Clinic, to the women in 825 Cath-
edral.

The number taking this test has
already surpassed last year’s fig-
ure when only 187 students of-
fered themselves for free "volun-
tary Tuberculin examinations.

Note: The Pitt News will
carry an important announce-
ment in Wednesday’s issue for
students who have shown posi-
tive reactions on the Tubercu-
lin tests and who have been
urged to take X-rays by the stu-
dent health doctors.

Last year’s figures are interest-
ing in view of the factthat most
of the 187 students were athletes
—-hu.sky specimens with no
thought that the disease might
have touched them. ‘

Of these 187, 66 showed positive
reactions. Of .these, 14 took €x-
ray photos and five active tuber-
culosis cases, previously unsus-
pected, were found.

They Didn’t Know,
But They Discovered . . .

N a story appearing on page one today, we
read that last spring 187 students, all told,
took free Tubereulin tests.

Most of these 187, the story continues, were
University athletes, healthy and brim full of
life, to all outward appearances.

But. among these 187 test.-takers were found
ﬁve active cases of the dread Tuberculosis.

Two of these cases we know about, and be-
cause they offer a. contrast to the case we re-
ferred to the other day we shall repeat them.

Both these boys were at'hletes—-both looked
and acted like the picture of health. I

When Tubereulin tests were offered last
year, both boys presented themselves at Falk
Clinic, and were found to have positive Tu-
berculin reactions.

X-Ray photos were taken, and lesions were
found in the lungs of each. These Tubercu-
losis lesions were just in their ﬁrst stages. The
doctors at the Clinic explained the situation to
the boys, promised a full cure provided they
would take the necessary precautions over. the
summer.

Fall came a11d with it‘ basketball season.

One of the boy’s lesions had entirely disap- -

peared. He was a ﬁrst string basketball star
in the recent campaign. The other boy still
had some small lung infection and it was deem-
ed advisable t.o keep him out of competitive ac-
tion this year.

He is, however, taking a full schedule of
classes, and his lesions are healing rapidly.
The Tuberculosis tendencies of both boys were
caught "in time.

Tuberculin tests, absolute method of ﬁnding
negative reactions, and absolute method of
ﬁnding whether an X-Ray is needed, are be-
ing offered at no cost to the student today,
tomorrow, and \Vednesday of this week, at the
Student Health Services. ‘ '

 

Japanese Turtles
In vade, Campus

\Ve understand that the junior women of ‘the
,University-on Thursday last did l1oii1ageto_'tl1e
‘patron saint of Ireland, the honorable St. Pat-
rick, who is said to have driven the snakes
from the land. The junior woinenobserved the
occasion of the saint’s commemoration by an
Emerald Tea in Heinz House. '

\\’ha.t we fail to understand is how the junior
women ever got the Isle of Erin tradition some-
how confused with turtles. It was snakes--
deﬁnitely snakes—St. Patrick rid the island of.
So far as we have been able to determine, tur-
tles never have existed in the Celtic land.

\Vhich is the reason why we don ’t see the
reason for passing out toy turtle souvenirs.
The Irish will resent that. The turtles were
cute, no doubt, but We still think that interna-
tional repercussions ought to be considered.
Undoubtedly, the toy turtles at the Emerald
Tea were out of place.

And still worse is the fact that the turtles
were made in Japan. They were fascist toy
turtles. \Ve don’t like the fascists, and we
don ’t like their turtles any better. Vile are al-
together in favor of eliminating both fascist
war and fascist toy turtles from the face of the
earth. And we think we ought to begin by
eliminating the latter.

\Ve could easily be led to believe that the
junior women were engaged in fascist propa-

Sonnets

For The Very Young
By Milton G.

In which a Question is pointed at those who would
turn the melting Pot into a Distillery.
Americans are funny, don’t you think?
The men wear English tweeds and call it “style”;
They smoke cigars from Cuba and they drink
A liquid labeled Scotch. They make you smile.

The women dress in silk from old Japan;
They use perfume from flowers grown in France;
Their rugs are Turkish; furs, Canadian;
And Africa adds diamonds for romance.

They imitate the art of ancient Rome;
They praise the opera of Germany;

They purchase Spanish paintings for their home,
A building formed with Greek simplicity.

And then they scream: “Americanization
VVill save the country. We're for isolation.”

STOP and GO

Now I don’t want any of you gees getting me
wrong. I thought A Slight Case of Murder was a
damn fine picture, see. It wasiwritten and acted
by a bunch of allright guys so don’t go making any
cracks. .

Personally though I didn’t see that there was
much percentage in Marko——that’s E. G. Robinson——-
turning legitimate. Allright, so repeal did queer
up the booze racket, he could have found somethin’
else to do without bein’ honest about it.

Allan Jenkins and Eddie Brophy felt the same
way, too. Of course, they didn’t go shootin’ off their
mouth about it because Marko was mean when he
was crossed, but what the hell he didn’t have to re-
form. '

And Pm willing to bet that if he hadn’t gone

"long and stayed illegitimate he’da never had to
take his outa that classy girls’ school in France
and she’da never had a chance to get engaged to
that copper.

You know, that hurt Evlarko. His own daughter,
his own ﬂesh and blood goin’ for a copper. Gee.
I’da never th.ought anybody related ‘.0 him would
over :':'all for 71 :‘-tripe and brass buttons. But well

Boy believe zne I never saw that much :".oidin’
money in my life. Sad Sam, the bookie Little
Dutch stole the simoleons from, sure looked down
in the mouth and who wouidn’t losin’ ﬁve hundred
grand.

But those ﬁve hundred grand, boy they came 
just right for Marko. I-le’d a never saved the brew-
ery from those leeches from the bank who had the
mortgage without that dough. No, sir, little Marko
was right up against it. And with four stiffs in
the guest room, too. Geez what a ‘predicament!

It was tough Little Dutch had to get shot just
as he was holdin’ a full house with ladies and johns
tho. If that ever happened to me I bet I’d die.
Oh well, it was a good picture thanks to Damon

nd and Fury

, By fames R. D-onoghue
ENOUGH CRITICISM already has been leveled at the peri-
odical twistings and turnings of American foreign policy with-
out another jaundiced columnist piercinrr the atmosphere with

But columnist or no, a question is in order relative to Mr.
I-Iull’s \'ational~-Press Club speech of last. Thursday.
‘Nhat I would like to know—and I ask the question in a

purely non-partisan
what is an “entaﬁgling alliance.”
Are all alliances entangling? If
not, when does a particular alli-
ance become entangling? Do
some alliances entangle more than
others and if so, how much? More-
over, how is one to tell when, and
how much, an alliance entangles?

UNENTANGLINS

Going deeper into the technical
aspects of the question we run
across some more questions. Is
an understanding an alliance?
When does, an understanding be-
come an entangling alliance? Is a
‘convention an alliance? Is it en-
tangling? Does ‘the term alliance
comprehend sub rosa military and
naval agreements?

I think we must admit at the
outset that the term “entangling”
just doesn’t mean anything more
than a label to attach to something
that we don’t like. All alliances,
and the word alliance here broad-
ly covers all forms of agreements
between national states,- are en-
tangling to some degree or an-
other.

POLITICAL HORSEPLAY

The degree to which they be-
come sufficiently “entang1ing” to
excite public opposition is when
military or naval aid are prom-
ised in certain eventualities. And
every nation to a greater or less
extent must explicitly or implic-
itly enter into such agreements. It
is as impossible to visualize a sys-
tem of national states without al-
liances as it is to think of a ham-
burger sandwich without pickle.

When Mr. Hull advocates “par-
allel action” on the one hand and
condems “entangling alliances” on
the other, he is indulging in a

sense — is¢

quaint bit of political horseplay
peculiar to democracies. If our
foreign policy is to “parallel” that
of some other nation, obviously
we have to tell that nation what
we are up to, just as it fnustitell
us what it’s doing; otherwise both
i would fall all over themselves try-
ing to save the world from some-
thing or other.

In short there must be agree-
ment on a common course of ac-
tion. Now if Mr. Hull chooses to
say that this is not an “entangling
alliance” it’s all right with me_——-
but I do insist that it wreaks
havoc on the meaning of the word
“entangling!”

CAMPAIGN FOR WAR

Possibly the fault lies in the fact
that Mr. Hull is not abble-rous-
ing so much as he is suffering
from a state of mental indecision
chronic with statesmen of repre-
sentative democracies. Intellect-
ually, he ought to realize that he
cannot blow hot and cold at the
same time; he cannot pursue a
course of parallel action at the
same time he reaffirms our splen-
did isolation. As a matter of prac-
tical policy he ought to be one
thing or another. If publicly he
does not take a stand, we must
either assume that he too is in-
dulging in the frequently-charged
campaign to prepare the American
public opinion for war or else that
he just doesn’t know what he is
saying.

In any case his present position
is remarkably similar to that of
Sir Edward Grey, the English for-
eign secretary during the years,
1909-1914. And one gains scant

consolation from that.

is located on theright of the

Fifthavenue féhtraiice to the Cathedral, is one of the several

romance of the Old World;

Mr. Reginald Fairlie, descend-
ent of a famous royal Scottish
family, designed the interior arch-
itecture‘ for the "room. _ From the
seventeenth" century, chosen be-
cause of its lacklofiforeign inﬂu-
ence on Scottish"arch'itecture, he
gathered the inspiration for the
frieze. It ispatterned after the
frieze in the ancient Elcho castle
in Perthsire.

SCOTTISH CLANS

The frieze which is a decorative
panel is worked _out in a tri-an-
gular style with the badges ofjthe
different clans molded in the
plaster. Some of the badges of
the class included are: the heather
for Maclntyre and MacDonald,
oak for Stuart, pine for MacGreg-
or, deer for Scott and myrtle for
Campbell. Twenty clans in all
are represented in this frieze. On,
the ceiling of the Scottish Room
are designs of the national ﬂower
of Scotland, the thistle, worked
out in white plaster.

DOORS DUE SOON

The committee for the Scottish
Room, Royal Order of Scottish
Clan, Daughter of Scotia, together
with the architect, have decided
upon stained glass windows with
medallions of the four famous
universities of Scotland: St. An-
drews’, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and
Aberdeen.

Adapted from the design of the
‘carved entrance doors at Rowall-
an castle in Ayrshire, the doors of
the Scottish class room are skil-
fully fashioned. These
which are being carved in Scot-
\land, are due to arrive in Pitts-
burgh this month.

A huge wood-burning fireplace,
with its carved overmantle, has
{also been planned by Mr. Fairlie.

faniett Claims
Even Candid
Cameras Lie

Cameras can lie, no matter how

“candid” they may be, admits
Thomas M. Jarrett, University
photographic technician. They can
be made to distort the actual
scene by differences in elevation
or angle, and ﬁnally, by retouch-
mg.
I But retouching does not al-
,ways improve on the truth; it
'sometimes makes photographs
look worse, according to Mr. Jar-
rett. “I do very little retouching.
ll like to see lines in a man’s
lface. They show character,” he
l claims.

 

PREFERS COLOR

, Referring to the currently pop-
!‘ ular pliotogr:-.3hic hobby, Mr. Jar-
irett believes that candid cameras
{have their use, but that they will
g-not displace other cameras. He
jp-refers to use both a Speed
iGraphic and a portrait camera, as
well as a candid one.

At present, Mr. Jarrett’s spe-
cialty is color photography. Al-
though color prints represent a
new field at the moment, the pho-
tographer does not think that
they will become popular hob-
by: the cost involved is too great.

Mr. Jarrett, who was appointed
University photographer last July,
started his career as an assistant
to his father, one of the oldest
photographers in the city. During
the World War he served in an
infantry unit, as color sergeant in
the Twenty-eighth Division.

WILL DISPLAY PICTURES

Mr. Ja;;ett has exhibited his
pictures in approximately 50 dif-
ferent camera clubs scattered over
the country. His work was award-
ed the John Erickson trophy in
the Child Portrait class at the
Professional Photographers’ con-
vention, as well as certificates of
merit.

Within a few weeks one of his
‘pictures will be displayed in the
;Pittsburgh Salon at Carnegie Mu-
’. hibits in the country.

Buckeye A Hard

PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA

City   ock ey Crown At Stake
in Duke-Pitt Play-Off Tonight  

Starting out as high school
and prep champions, most of
the boys on Mike Peppes Ohio
State swiiniuing team are now
ranked in the upper hierachy
of the water. They will convene
with the “big ﬁsh in a little pond”
when they stroke against Pat
Corr’s Eastern Collegiate cham-
pions in the slow Metropolitan.
Club pool tomorrow evening.

It being the case of the big ﬁsh
from the ocean against the big
ﬁsh from the mountain stream, the
result would be given very sub-
stantial odds in Jack Doyle’s rat.-
ings. Hardier environment alone
could be considered the determin-
ing factor in OSU’s favor.

:14 =1‘ ‘—‘:'-

Just the same, the Buckeye na-
tional champions are going to get
more than a
ducking, e s -
pecially when
they plunge in-
to the water
against Milt
Lederstein and
Al B e a c o n .
There is a con-
siderable pub-
lic opinion that
is waiting to
see the big Le-
derstein swim
against an op-
ponent that
really will give him a race.

it  it

One of the stars of the Buckeye
brigade is a product of the local
swimming holes. Al Patnik, the
AAU titleholder, and a junior at
Ohio State, received his appren-
ticeship and original development
from two very prominent local
swimming men.

2: $ it

Prepping over at Taylor All-
derdice high, Patnik cameunder
the inﬂuence of Frank Hoar, a
Springﬁeld College man, who is
on the physical education staff of
that V institution of secondary
learning. Hoar is ‘a former Olym-
pic diver and tumbler himself. In‘
his short stay at Allderdice he has
turned out three interscholastic
diving champions, among which
was Patnik.

=.E =3 :1:

It was Jack Scarry, the well-
known tutor at the Homestead Li-
brary, who polished off Patnik.
Scarry put Patnik on the “giant
belt,” which is an instrument used
‘u training divers. The belt is sus-
pended on pulleys and is wide
enough to be wrapped around a
man’s waist and to hold him sus-
pended in air. Patnik developed
the muscles he now uses in diving
out of the water on this belt.

HAT “mighty little front line” will skate its mightiest tonight

at the Duquesne Gardens when it tries to pierce the Duquesne
defense in the ﬁrst contest of the two game Eastern division’s play-
offs. Reading from left to right they are “Arsenault-Killer” Taylor

Brittain, and free scorers Dick Friday and Bob Schooley.

Kappa Sigs Come Back --

Win Indoor Track Trophy

Last, ’l‘hursda,v evening, in the annual Indoor Interfraterniity
Track and Field Meet, the scant clads of the Kappa Sigma_ house
churned up the track dust to almost a suffocation clegree, and
collected twenty-three points to cop the track and ﬁeld plaque-

The Kappa Sigs hugged a t.wo-point advantage over Phi
Gamma Delta and an eleven point lead over Delta. Tau Delta.

who ﬁnished second and third, in¢

that order. Kappa Sig placed
fourth last year, whereas the run-
ner-up, DTD, salted away the ’37
trophy.

The individual events were run-
off in rapid and orderly succes-
sion, with Trainer Roland Logan,
freshman track - coach Jimmy
Potts and assistant dean of men
Robert -Corley in charge. Physic-
al Education majors assisted Lo-
gan, Pottsiand Corley.

The 200-yard shuttle, first in the
four field events, was won by the
Kappa Sig quartet composed of
Powers, Zolnoski, Weurtenberger
and Hoeveler. Time, 24.4. Phi
Gams were second best and Delts
third.

Kappa Sig’s quartet of speed
merchants ran away with the
eight-lap relay, with the best time
ever turned in for inter—frater-
nity competition, 2:26.5. The Phi
Gam’s pulled in a close second
and the Theta Chi’s ran hard to
place.

Powers, Zolnoski and Hoeveler
teamed up again, with Grimm
substituting for Weurtenberger,
for another ﬁrst, this time in the
important medley relay. Their
time was 3221.2. Phi Gam cinder-

men once again watched the Kap-
pa Sig heels cross the chalk line
ahead. Phi Delta_ Theta signed
in third. . '

Footballer Larry Peace, of the
Theta Chi clan heaved the shot 48
feet and six and a half inches, to
easily win the shot put match.
Konetsky, another gridder, Kappa
Sig, muscled the shot 32 feet, to
take second. .Phi Gam’s Pressel
was a strong third.

In the high bar event Phi Gam’s
P--ressel showed the way with a
ﬁve foot, two inch protest against
gravitation. Trump, Pi Kappa
Alpha’s only point-maker, left the
ground for a second and Wells,
Phi Gam, rated third.

Phi Gam’s Thurbon cinched the
broad jump, hurdling himself 21.6
into the saw dust. Grimm boosted
the Kappa Sig’s score with a sec-
ond. Delta Tau Delta’s Kennedy
sprang for a third berth.

The hop-step-jump affair, the
feature of the evening in so far as
fun is concerned, netted ﬁrst

credit to Thurbon. Williams of

Delta Tau Delta was second in. the
I circus event and Grimm, Kappa
Sigma, third.

It is the pleasant duty of this
reviewer to state that the sole
program,
“Death, I Do Not Fear Thee,” was
the bestinumber on the program.

FIRST-RATE SOLOISTS

The club is fortunate in pos-
sessing two ﬁrst rate soloists, Wil-
liam Cover and Andrew Feyka.
Cover, tenor soloist with the Glee‘
Club, sang the aria “Il Mio Teso- I
ra,” from “Don Giovanni” by MO-- I

zart.

His voice, always rich, has add-
ed several notes to its register,
and there is none of the strainingf
effect one noted in his solo efforts

Feyka sang an aria from VeI’di’§
“La Traviata." His voice is true‘
bass instead of the rather weak

baritone most often found in col- I

lege voices. Both of the soloists

gave encores.
FINNEY ARRANGEMENTS

Mr. Finney has written admir-‘I

numbers, ?‘Come Where My Love
Lies Dreaming,” and “Jeannie
with ‘the Light Brown Hair.” They
are delicate, and yet they utilize
all sections of the vocal choir.

of concerts.

, Also it was good to hear Sulli-
van’s ‘_‘Lost Chord” intelligently
performed. This piece’ is murder-
ed, both by the nasal outpouring
of church quartets, and operatic
-tenors who regard the piece as a
peculiar sort of endurance giiound
for holding onto high “C’s.”

Work is being conducted or will

The rooms now in the process of
being built are the Czechoslova-

vian, Scottish, and Swedish rooms,
which are located on the ﬁrst ﬂoor
facing the Commons Room.

Special doors have been de-
signed for all of the rooms. The
interior of these doors will be in
keeping with the plan of the
rooms, but the outsides will be
plank doors, with heavy wrought
iron hinges and handles.

The metal work, similar to that
on the Foster Memorial doors, will
