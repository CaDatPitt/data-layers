D. PROGRAM DIVERSIFIED

 

H The Thid Annual University Band
_. Concert will be given one week from
tonight, tomorrow and -Thursday at

the Carnegie Music Hall, and one of
the most attractive programs ever ar-
ranged has been announced by the
hand management. The diversiﬁed
program includes, not only the rendi-
tion of several famous overtures and
marches by the band, but has been
made doubly ‘attractive by the an-
nouncement that a. Saxaphone Sept-
ette will favor with several selec-
tions, “‘Mike” Mayers will liven
things with several comical readings,
whilea bassoon solo by Harry An-
chutz and a tenor solo by John In-
-gram add considerably, to the even-

, I ing’s entertainment to those who are‘
‘  - acq‘uai'nt-ed with their musical ability.
4 The program "contains four selec-
tions, composed by two well-.known
Pitt Alumni and two by men well-
known to the Pitt Student body, be-
.,cause of their activities with the Pitt
"Band, Coach Rocereto, for the past
seven’ years coach of the band, is the
I _author of two pieces, which are a
7; part: of the program-—one a march,
~;“T—he’Blue Ridge Division,” to be
played by the entire "body, and the
other is “Corole, in B Flat,” to be
played by the Saxaphone Septette.

in,

 

The former piece was first played be- '

fore the public at the Second Annual
‘Concert last May, at which time it
was still in manuscript form. The
respone of the large audience as-
sured it of great success. Since then,

it has been published and is being-

widely played by the leading bands

and Man Respectively

 

 

-The Saturday evening performance
of “All in a Day,” the annual Cap
and Gown production, on May 10, has
been set aside as “Alumni Night,”
because of the rapidly increasing de-
mand for seats by Alumni. Although
the advance sale has been the largest

Club, there are yetmany good seats‘
available, it has been announced by
the authorities. '

According to Assistant Director
Earle J.-Cox, Dent., ’25,
Day” will equal any performance yet
offered by the club, since the book is
exceptionally good, and
laughs from the chorus to the ﬁnal
‘ensemble. It will be played by an
cast and a good,
snappy chorus. ‘

It is believed that Pitt can feel
justly proud of Leo Hillery, Dent,

and who will again take a similar
part during the present_ season. Many

Theresa Kahn, supported the af-
firmative side of the argument. The

- By ELMER G. KLABER   .. C  

 The Panther Freshman baseball team, in aislow game Ll,L'a.stlLA.—i'T’:iiiési'

times, m’Laking}Lth‘e score 9 to 5. But

Coach ‘Barrett was after more than a’
win in the opening exhibition, and”

sent‘ in substitutes " freely. .Then
Schenley, with its more ‘”‘deVe1(L>l39d
Lnine,'st_epped‘to‘ bat and scored eight

run-ssvin the last three i-nnings, mak-

ing the ﬁnale 13-11. L ' -
One cannot say that either team
gave a L very classy exhibition, al-

thou’-gLh,the lSchenley players were

charged -with"only "four errors, while

the cubs were guilty of 'eleven.LL It
was a. typical opening gam.e, with an
abundance of hits. runs and “bo_IL1ers.’L’
Almost all the players. lacked that
conﬁdential ’ air and smoothness,

which come only after several real

struggles. .lAs.,aLresult, play dragged
at times and‘ became rather bore-
some towiardslthe end.

The ﬁelding of the rival shortstops,
Liggett of Schenley, and Dummer of
Pitt, was a feature of the game. The
former handled ﬁve ldiffioult chases
without, a slip, while Dummer com-
mitted only one. error in seven tries.
Another ‘encouraging high‘ spot was
thetwirling of Betti, who struck out

four of the enemy‘ and otherwise be-

wildered them With his slants, The
poor ﬁelding of his-somewhat “green”
mates lost the game.“ Botti was no
slouch with the hickory, slamming
out three hits——one .a double. Led-L

iHilli,A‘coming Ls‘hLot zputter; .Charlie
Paddock, sensational runner (if the is

‘reinstated by the A. A. U.); and Matt‘

Mcerath, the”New York cop who
throws the -hian‘1mer._ Possibly" the on-
ly local Lentrant who is almost sure of
the trip is Earle Johnson, _Edga.r
