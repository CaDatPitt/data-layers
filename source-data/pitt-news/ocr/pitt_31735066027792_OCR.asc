Provocation, division, and hostility were
the order of the day at the City—County
Building on Saturday.

As the Ku Klux Klan gathered on the
steps and spewed forth their message of hate,
they tried to turn the counter—protestors against
each other, recnrit members, and instigate vio-
lence.

The Klan opened with a prayer by Jeff
Beny, the Imperial Grand Wizard. Berry start-
ed by praying for a peaceful rally but tipped his
hand with the last line of the prayer: “If vio-
lence does break out, then let it be.”

He then tumed it over to the Klansman

“You people hate what you do not under-

I do understand.” '

He then went on to say that the Klan is
“not about hate. Over there is your hate group,”
he said pointing at the crowd.

The Klan speakers attempted to use fear
and hate to instigate violence in the crowd.
They goaded the crowd by accusing Pittsburgh
Steeler Rod Woodson of rape and saying that
the counter—protestors “belonged in a cage.”

A six-foot metal fence, a wall of police
officers in riot gear wielding 3—foot clubs, and
135 feet of space prevented an angry mob
from stomring nearly 40 Ku Klux Klan mem-
bers speaking on the steps of Pittsburgh’s
City-County building Saturday.

Thousands of onlookers surrounded the
building, many pressing themselves against
the chain-link fences that blocked each street,

 
 

waving signs and screaming obscenities.

Dozens of armed police canying hand-
held metal detectors set ched members of the
crowd as they entered the caged—in parking
lot directly across from the Klan rally.

Police prevented onlookers from smug-
gling in weapons, but once the Klan began to
speak, dozens in the parking lot began tearing
up the very ground they stood on and hurled
the chunks of broken asphalt at the masked,
ranting members of the KKK.

The intermittent drizzle and busload of Klansmen up the street
didn’t stop about 2,00() supporters from attending the Market Square
anti—KKK rally on Saturday. Speakers and bands spreading their
message of peace packed the stage for over three and a half hours.

dance, the event carrre into full swing.

Mayor Tom Murphy was among the
ﬁrst to takethe microphone and address the
crowd. His message was not one of celebra-
tion and sharing, but rather one of prepara-
tion for a longer battle against racism.

"The challenge is not to come together
to feel good," said Murphy. Instead, he said
the lorrg—terrn goal of accepting diversity “in
the boardroom and the political structure”
will be the difficult task.

fall. Behind the stage area. a mother lowered
her head beside her daughter. covered in a
rain slicker, and read her a speech by Martin

Those in the audience mixed thoroughly and talked occasional-
ly amongst themselves. Still, most focused their attention on the
speakers who were forced to change every two minutes to accom-
modate the long list of people scheduled to talk.

Andy Newman, the editor of In Pirrsburglz, delivered a speech
that struck at the heart of racism, and he vowed to continue his ﬁght
against it. His address, staggered with the swelling cheers of the audi-
ence, received sonre of the loudest and longest cheers of the day.

Monday, April 7, I997

Student government paid for a bus to
transport students to and from the city coun-
cil last week so that students could have a
means of getting downtown to voice their
support for the closing of Bigelow
Boulevard.

But only seven people rode the bus.

Student govemment also holds Town
Hall meetings every month as an outlet for
students to raise concerns about issues on
campus and talk to the administration.

This month’s meeting only drew 25
people.

"This has got to stop,” said Student
Govemment Board President Justin
DalMolin. “Students keep asking, ‘What are
you as the Student Government Board
going to do for me?’ Students need to start
thinking, ‘What can we as students do
together?”

While the Board attacked the student
body as “apathetic” at last Wednesday’s
meeting, few were willing to address the
issue that many students
may simply disagree with
the SGB’s goals.

Five of the eight SGB

showed disappointment in
the turnout.

DalMolin and Board
Members Christa
Douaihy, Brandi Miller,
David Eisenberg, and
Bigelow Boulevard Task
Force leader Jennifer Molluso were all out
on Bigelow last Wednesday trying to per-
suade students to get on the bus.

From 9 am. until 1 p.m., the board
members stood out on Bigelow, stopping
random students and telling them about the
bus and its purpose. Both Douaihy and
DalMolin said they felt as if they were try-
ing to sell something to the students, when
they were only trying to get more people
downtown to support the closing.

All seven students that rode the bus
downtown last week were acquaintances of
the five board members. SGB paid $121 for
the bus and used the Student Activities Fee
to cover the cost.

“It was ridiculous,” Douaihy said. “It
was a waste of money zuid a waste of time.
We practically had to beg people to get on
the bus. We put in a lot oftiine zuid effort into
this, and only a few students showed their
support."

port on the Bigelow issue may have serious

SGB voices frustration with

consequences on the SGB agenda for the
rest of the year. ‘

‘‘It is possible that the board may take a
look at the agenda and see which issues we
think the students will support and focus on
those,” Douaihy said. “As far as the
Bigelow issue is concerned, the board will
still keep our personal inﬂuence and
involvement.”

The board spent last week organizing
and advertising for the event. They passed
out ﬂiers, stuﬂ°ed them in campus mailbox-
es, dorm stormed, and set up a table on
Bigelow Boulevard the day of the event.

“We spent all week planning and get-
ting ready for this rally,” Molluso said. “And
there were only seven people that showed
up. I am very disappointed with the students
on this campus.”

DalMolin agrees. He said he thinks stu-
dents want the road closed, but they failed to
show their support.

“It was disappointing,” he said. “We
provided transportation and publicized what
we were trying to accomplish, but the stu-
dents didn’t take the opportunity to change

" ' ' * things.”

Though last Tuesday’s
Town Hall meeting saw a
, few more students, the
 outcome was the same.
Board Member Marquette
Bowman, who came up
with the idea for the meet-
ings, said that attendance
was sparse in the begin-
ning of the meeting, but it
climbed by the end.

“We’re going to keep
forging on,” Bowman said. “It is disappoint-
ing because we put forth so much time,
work, and effort for the students, and no one
really pays attention. We are doing these
things for them.”

Bowman said that the SGB will keep
the meetings because, he said, they are an
outlet for student opinion, and the meetings
don’t cost anything to run.

 
 
  

0 In other action at the meeting, several
student groups were on hand to hear the out-
come of the budget decisions made by the
Allocations committee and the Appeals
Board.

The board members approved some
requests for small amounts, but all the
requests for a large amount of money were
sent back to the Allocations committee and
the Appeals Board for further consideration.
The final decisions will be announced at this
week’s board meeting on Wednesday at
9:30 p.in. in Room 637 of the William Pitt
Union.

Protest

Because of the crowd’s size.
police could not identify or prevent
the ones throwing rocks.

When the first Klan member
marched out of the City-County
building to test the microphone, the
crowd rushed the fence, causing it
to warp and come apart.

Police charged forward to reat-
tach the fence, blasting several in
the mob with pepper spray to force
them back.

Waving American,
Confederate, and Nazi ﬂags, the
Klan poured out of the City—County
Building and ﬂooded the steps.
Ironically, because of the crowd’s
shouting and a poor sound system.
few of the Klan’s words could be
heard. .

Still. arms reached above the
fence and waved at the Klan. Some
had clenched ﬁsts, others raised
their middle fingers, and still others

C beckoned the Klan to take of their

masks and come into the crowd.
But not everyone inside the
fence was there to protest the KKK.
Randy Bartley and three
friends came all the way from
Connelsville, PA., to show their
support. Clad in Confederate ﬂag T-
shirts, Bartley and his crew stood
together in a tight circle, silently
watching the rally from behind the

_ crowd. .

“I’m here because we give
[blacks] too much,” he said. “[The
KKK] is here because they want to
show that you have to help yourself
and can’t expect the government to
give you equal rights.”

Bartley watched the crowd
mefully, but he never raised his
voice when he spoke. ‘Others who
shared his opinions were more dar-
mg.

Andy D’Marco was overheard
saying he supported the Klan and

 

FROM PAGE I

was soon sunounded by reporters
and angry protestors.

‘“Scuse me, sir! Ex-cuse me
sir!” shouted a black man named
Charles Alfaro, as he pointed at
D’Marco from between several
reporters.

D’Marco, his face red from
shouting, “I just said I'm against the
Jews because they started commu-
nism!” glared at him.

“Do you believe in God, sir?”
Alfaro asked him. “Do you believe
in God?”

D’Marco smirked, “No, I don’t
have to believe in God."

“Is that why you have hatred
and evil in your heart, sir?” Alfaro
asked.

D’Marco became enraged, spit
ﬂying from his lips as he shouted at
the crowd of people who had sur-
rounded him.

“Look back at history!" he
shouted “You’ll see! The Jews are
trying to make America commu-
nist!"

Police bossed the crowd back
and escorted D’Marco away. 4

“I wasn’t trying to harass him,”
Alfaro said as the crowd broke up.
“I just want to show that, hopefully,
we can understand these people,
and understand their negativity
rather than feed into it with rage.”

But Alfaro’s feelings were the
minority, as people continued throt-
tling the fence and hurling rocks
overhead. ‘

, “TI-IE COPS AND KLAN GO
HAND IN HAND!” chanted pro-
testors as police forced them off the
fence.

“Nobody likes us,” said one
deputy county sheriff. “The Klan
hates us; the crowd hates us and
calls us racists. It’s raining. God
doesn’t even like us. It’s my golf
day.”

The   cage: Protestors in parking lot get a close-up

look at the police guard, and a more distant look at the Klan.

A cameraman and reporter
from KDKA—TV, interviewing a
mother and her young daughter in
the midst of the mob, were sur-
rounded and had to race out of the
parking lot when people started
tearing the camera apart. ‘

The frightened mother and her
daughter squeezed between the
horde and retreated to the wall
behind the crowd, refusing to speak
to any more reporters.

City Council President Jim
Ferlo walked around the back of the
crowd and said he thought the
turnout was positive.

‘This is great,” he said. “It just
shows the Klan how Pittsburghers
feel about them. Death to the Klan
— I mean, death to their ideology.”

Mike Greisler, a Pitt student,
was overheard screaming at the
Klan, “It’s not about hate; it’s about
being dead! THE ‘KLAN
SHOULD DIE!”

Greisler said he thought the
Klan should be killed because “if
you kill hate before it can breed,
then it’s gone.”

When asked if he thought that
philosophy was similar to the
Klan’s, he said he “didn’t think so.”

 

Monday, April 7, 1997

“When I say the Klan should
die. I’m talking about killing people
who would be more than happy to
kill other people,” he said.

Greisler and several friends
agreed that violence "should break
out."

“I think we should go after
them,” said Greisler's friend, Matt
Flegel. “I guess some people would
get hurt, but as long as the Klan got
hurt then I think it would show peo-
ple what this kind of rally can pro-
duce. If other people got hurt, it
would still show how dangerous it
is to give the Klan the right to
speak.”

As the Klan blared their static-
ﬁlled message through the streets,

Greisler pointed at them and shook
his head.

“This is just embarrassing.” he
said, as more protestors shrieked
obscenities and hurled rocks over
the fence.

“They say they have the right
to speak because of the first amend-
ment!” shouted one man. “But if I
tried to exercise my... right to bear
arms and brought my shotgun in
here, even though it's legal. the cops
would arrest me!” ‘

A few moments later, an explo-
sion from one of the side streets sent
the crowd scattering for cover while
the news media rushed to get a clos-
er look.

“It’s just a ﬁrecracker! An M-
80!” the police shouted over the
fence. “Calm down! It’s a hoax!"

. The KKK ﬁnally ended their
rally, and the crowd quickly dis-
persed without incident.

When asked if he thought the
police were successful in keeping
peace, a deputy county sheriff
escorting people from the parking
lot simply shrugged.

“I don’t know,” he said. “I
hope nobody was hurt. Hard to call
this kind of thing ‘successful.”’

“I will continue to ﬁnd out how the media

 

and journalism contribute to racism,” he said to
the applauding crowd. Newman also warned
of “classism” and being‘ sucked into bigotry
while trying to ﬁght it.

He quoted Niets7che, cautioning, “One
who ﬁghts monsters should see to it that in the
process he does not become a monster."

Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg’ also
spoke. and denounced members of the KKK
as “prisoners ofa fonn of intellectual and spir-
itual darkness.”

After leaving the stage, Nordenberg said
he will continue to promote  broad—based

As the afternoon wore on, many mean-

Klan rally. A steady stream of those coming
from the Klan rally site willingly took their
places.

At one point in the early aftemoon, two
women walked through the crowd wearing
white cardboard “KKK dunce caps" with ines-
sages on them denouncing the Klan.

A drunken protester noticed the women

A section of the square, called “Kid's

signs.

Marissa Barash. depicted people —purple,
red, and green — holding hzmds and laugh-
ing. Undemeath the picture. she printed a
simple message: “We can do it. you can be
friends with anyone. so we can try."

Families stood watching the speakers
with their anns around one another.

Then, as slowly as it had subsided, the
rain began again.

While the aftemoon wore on, and the ink
began to bleed down the front of signs, the
message of peace slowly began to fade into
the steel gray Pittsburgh sky.

It began when a group of black youths,
dressed in dark shirts and black running pants
M their faces hidden behind black handker-
chiefs —— parted the crowd on their way to the
stage.

The crowd around them shufﬂed and
wide—eyed glances were shot from husband
to wife and peace protester to peace protester.

Speakers continued to deliver their mes-
sages of while the youths took their
place and waited for the microphone.

Introduced by a member of the National
Council of Urban Peace and Justice, their
message was deceptively delivered in the
cloak of a peaceful message.

“Unity will have to come from the corn-
nrunity and the ‘hood," said one of the

masked youths. He spoke of the oppression
faced in black neighborhoods and the lack of
opportunity to escape them.

As he prepared to leave the microphone
the youth looked out into the crowd and said
two words: “Black Power!"

The youths extended their arms in uni-
son with clenched ﬁsts.

Bewildered, the crowd stopped its mur-
mur. and most stared at the stage or shook
their heads.

One man, mouth agape, glanced at his
girlfriend and lifted his eyebrows in a look of
confusion and surprise.

The police again donned their kevlar riot
gear helmets and face shields as a precaution,
while the youths descended the stage.

Other speakers took to the microphone,
and eventually the protest became targeted at
attacking the Pittsburgh Police and seeking
justice for Jonny Gammage and other “vic-
ti ms” of the Pittsburgh police.

Slowly, the crowd ﬁled out of Market
Square, exposing the cobblestone streets
which had been covered by the hoard of peo-
ple just hours before.

Some walking away from the rally
stared at an elderly black man passed out on
a bench in one of the Square’s comers. He’d
been there since it began, clenching a bright
yellow peace rally ﬂyer in his left hand.
Occasionally, the seat of his worn and filthy
pants became soaked with urine which ran
onto the sidewalk beneath the bench.

While they gawked and spoke amongst
themselves about the man, no one stopped.
Instead, many left with their faces scrunched
in disgust, as the rally came to a quiet close.

by voicing his con»
cerns over the KKK
rally.

“I urge anyone
who’s going to take
part in the rally to go
with peaceful inten~
tions. The Klan is
counting on a riot
taking place outside
the fence,” says
Boyd.

Pitt student Joel
Thomas, a member
of the Anti~Klan
Grant Street
Coalition, was also at
the meeting. He said
that his organization
is a peace group that
has 50 citizens
trained as marshals.
Thomas told the
crowd that the
Marshals would try
to calm people if they
begin to get upset or
if a riot breaks out.

According ‘ to
Thomas, peopie
should have been
encouraged to go to
the raliy because it's
“important that [the
Klan] know they’re
not wanted here."

and goaded the protestors.

"lhat’s all you people do is destroy
things” said a Klansrnan only identiﬁed as
Scott, who did not remove his hood. “You
apes! You ﬁlthy animals! I can’t stand to look at
you!”

Edward Foster, the local front manfor the
rally, came up to continue the rage that the
police tried to contain.

“We want to thank Mayor Murphy and his
boys for the cage over there. It’s too bad that all
you white people have to be put over there to
smell the niggers,” Foster said.

“That fence will be a partition to a sector
of the United States. We will partition off part
of the United States this country and put them
ﬁlthy nigger apes in there.”

Thompson then took the podium back
ﬁom Foster and once again tried to describe the
Klan as a group of “good Americans.”

“I go in for the religious part of the Klan,”
Thompson said. “I believe in the book of
Revelations. I believe the end of the world is
near. I’m not against [rrrinorities] personally. I
just don’t want them to take away what I
worked for and what my forefathers worked
for.”

He then introduced Steve Bowers, a leader
in the American Nazi Party. Bowers stayed true
to the message that the rest of the group was
trying to put forth.

“I am an American Nazi, and I hate every-
body except the good white people who came
out to hear the truth,” Bowers said.

Bowers went on to say that the Klan was
not simply the 40 or 50 people who stood on
the steps of the City-County Building.

“This is just our rally crew. We have thou-
sands and thousands of other supporters.”

V‘  «:'."'* "- '..<'-:‘.:. . aw’
   

 

Foster took the microphone to cornpli-
ment Sam Bowers, whose relation to Steve
Bowers, if any, was never elucidated. He spoke
about the 300 acts of terrorism and I7 murders
that Sam Bowers was supposedly responsible
for. As he went on talking about cross burnings
and about having everyone’s attention in
Pittsburgh, he broke down and began chanting
“Nigger, nigger, nigger” at the crowd.

“I’m not a hate monger,” Foster said, as
someone set otf a ﬁrecracker in the crowd. The
press and the police rushed over to ﬁnd out
what was going on and came back to the cen-
ter of the buffer zone between the Klan and
anti-Klan when there was no incident.

The next speaker was Hank Clement, a
member of both the Klan and the Nazi party.

“I came here for one reason -— to start a
race war,” Clement said after a rant about the
inferiority of blacks.

Throughout the entire rally, people within
the anti—rally compound hurled pieces of pave-
ment, fruit, and even coins at the Klan. During
Clements’ speech, a rock landed on the steps.
At this point, the Grand Wizard, Berry, took the
podium and remonstrated the demonstrators,
‘saying that they were pelting sympathetic,
Jevvish—controlled press and innocent police.

“You don’t need to hit people because you
don’t like them,” Berry said in what may have
been the most ironic statement of the rally.
“Now, let’s settle down and have a nice rally.”

The rocks kept coming, and the Klan did
not remain so magnarrirnous about the missiles.
Standing safely 135 feet away, knowing they
would have a police escort to a secret location
outside of town, they called for the counter—pro—
testors to come to the front and ﬁght.

back  Foster said, holding up a
roller—skate wheel. “Come on up,” he yelled in
response to jeers ﬁom the crowd.

They ended their rally with two themes.
The ﬁrst was to try to recruit new members.
They read out phone numbers and addresses
for the Klan and the Nazi party, saying that they
were almost one in the same.

Clement then took the stand again, trying
to compare the Klan to the founding fathers.

“When Thomas Jefferson wrote the
Constitution, he did not look out his window
and see his black slaves picking cotton and
think that they were equal,” Clement said,
apparently unaware that Jefferson was in
France during the writing of the Constitution.

He also said the Klan was preparing to
make themselves even more visible and to start
a race war.

“We’re coming out, you folks. All stops
are out. You be prepared, nigger. I’m going to
turn my night riders loose,” said Foster. His
attempts to explain the ‘night riders’ were dis-
mpted by the failing of the public address sys-
tem.

They then invited those who were inter-
ested to corrre to a cross burning ceremony in
Punxsutawney that night.

The ﬁnal statements were the “thank-
you’s” from the Klan.

They thanked the police and press, saying
that they were good people and did their job.

At 2:55 p.m Beny said “It’s time to say
goodbye to all you niggers.”

This didn’t prevent another few minutes of
epithets and slurs. Finally, Foster stepped in and
said the city govemment told them they were
out of time.

“We’re outta here. Let’s go; pack it up.
Let's go, white people, ZOG [Zionist Owned
Government] said we’re out of time.”

With that, they left. The crowd itself
thinned out quickly afterward.

What effect did the Klan have? Two stu-

dents from Duquesne who attended the rally

had very ditferent thoughts.

“I was kind of supporting [the Klan]," said
Sean Hurst. “I like some of the stuff they have
to 

When asked what exactly he supported,
Hurst simply responded, “I don’t know.”

The other student with him, Matt
Keilman, had a different take on the rally. A

"Their goal is to piss people off and make
people mad. They feed off our anger,” Keilman
said.

One day isn’t enough

The Ku Klux Klan rallied downtown Saturday, and people
stood up, took notice, and spoke out against the hate.

Protestors were kept separate from the Klan members by a
chain—link fence, and throughout the City, the buzz was about
the Klan coming to town. V

However, the things the Klan stands for go on every day

regardless of whether a Klansman is standing in your backyard.

This past year, the General Assembly of Pennsylvania
ended aﬂirmative action within this state. It also passed a bill
into law which makes English the official language of
Pennsylvania; now, no other language can be legally recognized
within the state. This was done by elected ofﬁcials who don’t
ﬂaunt what they’re doing like the KKK does.

Are things getting better, or are they ge"tting~worse?

Rallies against racism, discrimination, and bigotry should
happen regularly whether or not the KKK is, in town. At the very
least, April 5, should be a day to rally for peace and unity regard-
less of whether or not there is a visible, malicious presence.

Although it isn’t standing right in front of you wearing a

“white cloak and pointed cap, hate exists every day. Not only

should we try to counter it by publicly rallying, there are a lot of
small things that we can do.

We must have no tolerance for discrimination and bigotry
in any form. If we hear or see someone acting in a hateful man-
ner, we should work to stop it. It takes more than standing in
Market Square for one Saturday aftemoon or hurling insults and
rocks at KKK members to achieve peace and unity.

When you go to the ballot box, vote for people who will
work towards your goals. Check the policy decisions of your
state representative and senator. Did he vote in favor of making
English the only legally recognized language in Pennsylvania?
If he did, do you still want him in office?

Some good can come out of the KKK coming to town if we
work to make it so that their dream of a segregated America won
through a race war doesn’t come to pass. Instead, we must work
to achieve peace and unity. It won’t happen in just one day.

SGB isn't evil, it's just misguided

 

The proverb says you should
not beat a dead horse; however, I
would like to set a couple things
straight and present a different view
on the whole situation. The subject
that I am referring to is the latest

SGB/Allocations controversy
involving the Student Recognition
Dinner. Every year, there is a con-
troversy that arises such as this.
SGB‘ requests a large amount of
money, Allocations recommends
denial, SGB sends it back for further
review, Allocations denies it again,
SGB overturns it, controversy
ensues. As a former member of
SGB, I have had the privilege of
being involved in such a controver-
sy during last year’s computer pur-
chase. I would like to point out why
these controversies happen, and
what I believe the real issues of this
particular situation are.
As usual, this controversy has
been blown out of proportion, and
the criticism has been exaggerated
past any logical rationale. What are
the issues? SGB plans a $6000 din-
ner and awards ceremony to
acknowledge the leaders of student
groups. So, why the controversy? I
am sure that there would be no con-
troversy at all if Allocations
approved the program. Yes, a couple
of unintentional oversights and
minor technicalities caused this to
blow up. Since it happened, people
have been making criticizing
remarks and accusations. Well, it is
in my opinion that the majority of
these are uninformed or simply not
true.
People have accused SGB of
abusing their power, spending
$6000 of our money for a dinner for
themselves, and not acting in the

students’ best interests. In defense of
their ethics, I would have to say that
SGB is not abusing their power by
ovenuling Allocations’ recommen-
dation; they are simply using their
ability to make a decision which
they were elected to do. One must
understand that the Allocations
committee is appointed by SGB to
make recommendations based
strictly on policy, whereas SGB is
elected to represent the needs and
concerns of the student body. In
doing so, it is often necessary to
make a decision on less bureaucrat-
ic foundations.

Next, we have the “free lunch”
factor. People actually think that
they are doing this for a free dinner.
As a former SGB member, I can
assure you that if SGB wanted a free
dinner, they would not have to invite
275 students, and it definitely would
not be made by Marriott. SGB free
dinners occur at establishments like
Hemingways, Mad Mex, and Fuel
and Fuddle, and they usually don’t
involve others. Is this ‘wrong?
Possibly, but some reward has to be
instilled to motivate students who
put the majority of their time into
something they get paid less than
$2.00 an hour to do. »

The third criticism I have hear
was that they were not doing this in
the students’ best interests. I instinc-
tively believe, based only on my
dealing with these students, that
these SGB members believe that
this program is in the students’ best
interests. The students on SGB are
not conspiring against the student
body or sitting in a back room dis-
cussing how they are going to waste
some of your money. They are not
evil nor unintelligent. However, I do
believe that they are wrong.
Whether they are misguided or sim-
ply not looking at the big picture,

this dinner raises many question
marks. First, this dinner and awards
ceremony is basically a pat on the
back for the individuals invited. I
am not saying these individuals
don’t deserve to get a pat on the
back, but who is doing the patting?
They are basically patting them-
selves on the backs and spending
their own money to do it. They are
also spending the money of those
who are not getting acknowledged
to do it. Who decides who gets rec-
ognized? There are over 200 student
groups, each distinctively different
than the other. What kind of criteria
could possible be used to compare
the Ambassadors for Christ and the
Fly Fishing Club, and what elected
responsibility is it of SGB’s to deter-
mine? Since there are well over 200
student groups and only 275 people
invited, how many different student
groups will be represented? After
you subtract SGB members and for-
mer members like myself, there will
likely be a minority of student
groups represented or even invited,
unless only one person from each
group is invited.

I do think that it would be a
good idea to acknowledge these stu-
dents, but I am questioning as to
who should be acknowledging
them, whether they should be pay-

ing for it, and if it is the responsibil— .

ity of SGB to plan and put on sucha
program when they have much
more pressing matters that they

could be dealing with. So, I think.

that I did a good job on this column;
why don’t I give you $25 to buy me
an award and dinner? I would also
like to mention that I have been
invited and am definitely planning
to attend.

Marc F riedberg hopes that the food
at the Student Recognition Dinner is
worth all of the ﬁtss.

The PPC does have a
liberal bias

In the recent ﬂap over the liberal bias
in the Pitt Program Council’s lecture pro-
gram, I must side with Matt Mills. By cur-
rent standards of measuring discrirriina-
tion, conservatives have been grossly
oppressed. The proportion of conservative

speakers appears to be drastically below ’

the proportion of conservatives in the stu-
dent body; and, especially since George
Stephanopolous cashed his check for 30
grand, I suspect the conservatives have
seen the glass ceiling from below. Perhaps
Mr. Mills was using irony to display the
absurdity of these typical discrimination
indicators. Or, maybe he wants to establish
a quota system to redress the problem. I
think he was just pointing out what the lec-
ture committee seems to have (uninten-
tionally) forgotten: many students at this
University, including many liberals and
Democrats, would pay to hear a speaker
from the Right.

Also, the PPC should avoid feeling
smug about the recent poll results pub-
lished in The Pitt News. The sample was

I not only not random, it was predictably
. biased in favor of the PPC. There is no sur-

prise that students in political science and
English literature classes — which tend on
average to draw more liberal students ——

School spirit cannot
be measured in sales  

I am sick and tired of hearing com-
plaints about the “apathetic students body”
at Pitt. Pride in our school should not be
measured in ticket sales. As with the
majority of students, I spend what free
time I do have doing the things I enjoy
doing. That usually doesn't include paying
money I don’t have to watch a team that
loses all the time. This isn’t high school or
a small college (see Gannon) where all
there is to do on weekends is go to the
games. As far as closing Bigelow, sure it
would be nice to have grass there, but I
think this University and its student body
have more pressing issues (and please stop
saying we need to close it for safety rea-
sons; it’s embarrassing). I cross several

ETTERS

other streets during the
day without any prob-
lem. Maybe we should
hire a crossing guard
from a local elementary
school. That sure was
nice of the seven non-
apathetic members of
SGB to take time out to
grand stand. I wonder if
they spent any money
on the project, not that

  

they would have to have it approved. I am.

very proud to attend Pitt. So please do not
mistake my lack of attendance at what few
events Pitt offers for a lack of school pride.
Now if you’ll excuse me, it’s almost time
for cheap beer night.

Computer plan
makes no sense

Computer and Information Services
(CIS) has armounced their plan for
upgrading the operating system on the
Intel-based Personal Computers (PCs).
They have decided to go with Windows
NT (NT), even though a Business
Consulting Firm found NT to be the slow-
est network operating system (NOS). In
the shoot out, NT came in as the slowest

Monday, April 7, I997

NOS ﬁle server, 27 percent slower than
the leader. Second place went to Novel,
which was 10 percent slower than the win-
ner. First place went to OS/2, the fastest
NOS for PCs.

OS/2 has several advantages over NT:
OS/2 requires less hardware, has more
device drivers, more native software, runs
more Windows 3.1 and DOS programs,
costs less, and has an easier interface to
use. In addition, OS/2 runs java applica-
tions natively, not just inside a web brows-
er.

There are only two reasons I can think
of why CIS would choose NT over OS/2.
The first is for security. NT is shipped with
built-in security. But even Microsoft has
adrriitted that that security is not proven
over a network; it is only shown on stand-
alone PCs. OS/2 does not have security
built in. Instead, OS/2 leaves security up to
third party vendors, which, by adding
another layer, adds more security.

The second reason that CIS may have
chosen NT over OS/2 is that they have
been duped by the Microsoft marketing
machine. We would hope that that was not
the case, but then we know of many other
questionable decisions made by the
University of Pittsburgh.

My only joy is that I will be graduat-
ed long before the change-over occurs and
will not have to suffer the transition.

China is the

 

 

A few weeks ago, I wrote an article
ridiculing the misconception many people
have that the Japanese are out to control
the world. I ended my column by noting
that any real threat to American prestige
in the Paciﬁc rim will come from China.
A few people, curious about why people
like myself are concerned about the
Chinese, suggested that I elaborate on
what I said.

With the death last month of Deng
Xiaoping, China’s leader and the man
who was with Mao Zedong communists
when they gained power in 1949, China
has increasingly found itself in the news.
Human rights groups have criticized
China for its harsh treatment of political
dissenters. Last spring, they also made an
attempt to inﬂuence the elections in
Taiwan, which was part of China prior to
the events of 1949, by holding military
exercises dangerously close to the island.
Revelations were recently made that
China attempted to gain a lobby in
Congress by contributing money to candi-
dates for their election funds (which,
thanks to the Republican majority, has
attempted to get a larger and larger
foothold on conducting foreign policy in
recent years. Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich, keeping his reputation as a
loose cannon in tact, bluntly told the

eastern economic threat to the U.S.

China leadership: “We want you to under-
stand that we will defend Taiwan.
Period.” It is lucky for China to have
found such a prominent American politi-
cian foolish enough to make such a rash
statement and give them the excuse to
label the United States as the aggressor).
\Vithout a doubt, China will continue to
be in the news this summer when Britain
voluntarily gives them control of Hong
Kong.

China’s actions over the last year
have worried people, but for the wrong
reasons. With a massive army of over
three million people, many people regard
China as a signiﬁcant threat to the securi-
ty of American allies in the Paciﬁc. To be
honest, I don’t see their military might as
much of a threat to the United States or
our allies. Our nuclear arsenal is 20 times
larger than China’s, and our weapons are
far more advanced. Also, if the Chinese
were ever to attack Taiwan (with whom
the Chinese government want badly to
reunify), they would have to contend with
the U.S. Navy. Oumumbered tvvo-to-one
and equipped with vastly inferior ships,
the Chinese Navy would be hard-pressed
to transport their troops across the few
hundred miles of ocean they would need
to traverse in order to accomplish the job.
China’s army is mostly a paper tiger. It
looks impressive, but it is not all that pow-
erful. I think that China’s true threat
comes from their burgeoning economy.

 

Whenever people think of China,
their first thought is to note that China is
the sole remaining communist superpow-
er left on the globe, and on the surface,
China does appear to be a land of
immense poverty. For every telephone in
the United States there are 1.3 people,
whereas in China there are 36.4 people
for every telephone. The per capita GDP
of the United States is $25,900, nearly ten
times that of China at just $2,660.

However, compared to the state of
China just a few years ago, the situation
was far worse. The secret of China’s suc-
cess (and the reason why Japan will like-
ly continue to be plagued with a stagnate
economy) is the communist leadership’s
willingness to be ﬂexible and ignore party
ideology when it becomes inconvenient.
Whereas the Japanese stubbornly insist
upon solving their economic problems

with an inﬂexible government bureaucra-
cy, the communist Chinese are more than
willing to decentralize their economy. In
1978, the state owned 78 percent of the
businesses and the remainder were collec-
tively-owned businesses which the gov-
ernment partly controlled. Today the state
directly controls just 34 percent of indus-
try, and 29 percent of the economy is
entirely private-owned. Thanks to these
reforms, the Chinese middle class is
growing. That sort of ﬂexibility and open-
niindedness to new ideas shows that
China will only continue to grow eco-
nomically in the future.

So what is to be done? There are two
schools of thought. There are those who
think that because of the abuse of human
rights, China is untrustworthy and ought
to be aggressively contained. On the other
hand, the Clinton Administration and oth-
ers feel that it would be a mistake to go
out of our way to pick a ﬁght with a coun-
try that will likely have the third largest
economy in the world in just a few years.
While Clinton’s critics charge that his pol-
icy is one of appeasement, it makes more
sense in the long run. If we needlessly
antagonize the Chinese leadership and
make them feel that they have no other
alternative than to ﬁght us, we run the risk
of inaugurating a . second cold war, or
worse.

Michael Berquist thinks that China is a
threat that needs to be taken seriously.

  Magic can
wait his turn
like the rest

 

Magic Johnson has managed to
get his name in the news yet again,
twice in about ten days now. The
good news is that Magic’s HIV level
has been reduced to nearly unde-
tectable levels.

In other news, Magic seems to
believe that he is.worthy of some
kind of exemption from the required
waiting period before entering the
Basketball Hall of Fame. It’s for a

noble cause —- he has made it known,

that he wants to enter the Hall with
Larry Bird, his long—time arch—rival.

The two probably should go in
together. They, and their teams, had
one of the all-time great rivalries in
the history of any sport. Magic’s Los
Angeles Lakers and Bird’s Boston
Celtics combined to win eight NBA
championships in the 1980s. The
three championship series they
played against each other rank among
the greatest the NBA has seen.

It’s a shame that Magic never
thought about all of that before. No
athlete except Muhammad Ali has
had a sadder postlude to his career

than Magic. Unlike Ali, it’s hard to‘

have any sympathy for Johnson, no
matter how much you’d like to.
Johnson has nobody to blame for his
Hall of Fame entrance situation
except himself.

Johnson has retired from the
NBA about a bajillion times. To retire
once and come back is OK. Michael
Jordan did that, and when he came

8 back, he was still the best player in

the game.

When Magic did that the first
time, he was still a good player. His
act started wearing thin soon. No

Panthers sixth at

Northeast Regional

Salyers leads Pitt tumblers,’  
may make trip to nationals

By making regionals, the
Pitt women’s gyrrmastics team
achieved a goal set by Head
Coach Debbie Yohman. The
Lady Panthers proved that they
were one of the top 35 teams in
the country.

“This should give us the
conﬁdence to move into the top
25,” said Yohman. “We have
been one of the most improved
teams, if not the most improved
team, in the region this year.”

Pitt proved the seeding to
be conect, as they went into
regionals as the sixth seed and
came back to Oakland with
sixth place in the Northeast
region. \V1th a score of 190.65,
the Panther tumblers were able
to beat Rhode Island, who
scored only a 187.425. Pitt was
not able, however, to overcome
the performances of Penn St.
(194.15), Kent St. and host

 

Massachusetts (19225), and
New Hampshire (192).

The real story Saturday
was the perfonnance of fresh-
man Samantha Salyers. Salyers
scored a 9.875 on the uneven
bars and ﬁnishedin a tie for first
place at the meet. If a gynmast
ﬁnishes in the top spot on an
apparatus, she qualiﬁes to go to
the national meet to compete
for the national title on that
event. Since Salyers tied for
ﬁrst, there has not been a deci-
sion made as to whether or not
she will travel to nationals.

Salyers’ performance,
combined with a strong 9.8
effort by Danielle “Freddie”
Alba, helped the Panthers to a
solid 47.25 on the uneven bars.

Alba,‘ who had what was
reported as season-ending
elbow surgery three weeks ago,
got a 9.8 on the balance beam to
ﬁnish third in the event. Her

Pitt got over a 47 on all the »

events. On the vault, Robyn
Senior closed out her collegiate
career by pacing the team with
a 9.625, to help her teammates

ished with a 48.15.

“Our performance on the
beam was a great mental lift for
us,” said Yohman. “After the

meet, we wanted to redeem
ourselves and prove we could
perform on beam. This perfor-
mance should give us conﬁ-

Pitt tennis breaks recorcl, downs Dayton

 

For the past two seasons, the Pitt

women’s tennis team has.improved on
the team record in wins.

This year wasn’t any different.

Pitt not only eclipsed last year’s
record of 14 wins by defeating Dayton 8-
1 Friday, they did so with three matches
and the Big East Tournament left in their
season. '

“Each year we set goals, and break-
ing the record (for most wins in a season)
was one of those goals,” said senior co-
captain Tamara Kalesnik.

“It was a very good win for us,” she
said. “We have to be pretty pleased with
it.”

Against a Dayton team that Head
Coach George Dieffenbach said last
week would “be a real test,” Pitt passed
with ﬂying colors by sweeping the dou-
bles competition and dropping just one
singles match.

The most interesting match of the
afternoon involved number two seed
Erin Shalbrack. Shalbrack dropped the
first set 3-6, took the second set 6-4, and
was behind 5-4 (but winning 40-Love) in

 

the third set when her opponent fell and
rolled her ankle.

“I think when I hit the ball V she
wrong—stepped,” Shalbrack said of her
opponent, who was taken to the hospital.
“She was really hysterical.”

“All Iremember is hearing someone
screaming,” said Amanda Hoffman.

Shalbrack, who won by injury
default, wasn’t without her own medical
problems. Besides her usual knee sore-
ness, Shalbrack was suffering a respirato-
ry infection. g V 1

“I was really sick, so I was really
drained,” said Shalbrack, who drank
orange juice between points. “I just tried
to play consistent and keep with it.”

Number one seed Fran Davis and
number six seed Alison Bucher won 6-2,
6-2, and 6-1, 6-2, respectively.

Pitt’s leaders in singles wins, third-
seeded Hoffman and ﬁfth-seeded Beth
Gang, increased their total to 18.

The lone singles loss came at the
hands of Kalesnik.

“It was really disappointing to lose
in the third set tie-breaker because I was
down 5-3 and came back to lead 6-5,”
Kalesnik said of her 6-2, 6-3, 7-6 loss.
“And then to lose, it was heartbreaking.”

In doubles, Pitt’s top tandem of
Davis and Shalbrack won 8-3.

“We played really well,” said
Shalbrack. “We needed a little adjust-
ment period. We went through a little
slump, and we got it out of our system.”

“I think it was a turning point for us.”

In other doubles’ action, Bucher

teamed with Kalesnik to win 8-4, and .

Hoffman paired with freshman‘ Diane
Mulligan to win 8-6. '

The ‘Panthers host Duquesne

Tuesday at 3 p.m. and travel to '

Morgantown on Saturday to take on the
West Virginia Mountaineers and the
Georgetown Hoyas in a crucial Big East
Conference dual match. 1

Pitt will square off with West
Virginia at 1 p.m. and tackle Georgetown
at 4 p.m. V

Freshman Gang is new to Big East
competition but understands the impor-
tance of Pitt’s ﬁnal match before the con-
ference tournament.

“All Big East matches are big
because they determine where we’ll be
seeded,” she said.

“West Virginia and Georgetown are
tough teams. It’ll be tough, but I think we
can pull it out.”

Loper voted league's best freshman grappler

talked-about Panther recruiting

Pitt wrestler Rob Loper was

voted 1997 Eastern Wrestling
League Freshman of the Year last
week. The award capped off a stellar
first season for the Panther’s start-
ing 126-pounder. V

“I feel very honored and excit-
ed,” Loper said of receiving the
award. “It’s gratifying to get some
recognition for all the work I put in,
and it’s also gratifying because win-
ning [the award] was one of my pre-
season goals.”

Loper broke Pitt’s all-time
freshman wins record this season.

His 31-13 record — which included

a 15 match winning streak —
eclipsed the 28-6 mark that former
Pitt great Pat Santoro put together
during his 1985-86 freshman sea-
son.

Loper finished second in the
126-pound weight class at the EWL
Championships, losing only to
Bloomsburg’s Brett Tullo in the
finals. He went on and had an excel-
lent tournament- at NCAAs, where
he was only one win away from cap-
turing All-American status. .

After the season he had, Lope
knew he had a fairly good chance of
capturing the honor. He described

class in recent history. The group
was ranked as the l0th—best recruit-
ing class in the country this season.

This year’s award marks the sec-
ond time in three years that a
Panther grappler has received the
honor. Chad Jesko, Pitt’s starting
134—pounder, wrapped up the award
following the 1994-95 season.

Panther Head Coach Randé
Stottlemyer feels the award is a pos-
itive accomplishment for the
wrestling program.

“We’re delighted that Rob
received this prestigious award.
He’s a very dedicated athlete, and
his performance at NCAAs demon-
strated he’s got the potential to
become an All-American. But the
most important thing for Rob is that
he uses this award as a stepping
stone to get to that next level.

“The [EWL] coaches vote on the
award, and I think that’s what makes
it such a great honor. The people
voting are guys who really know the
sport of wrestling.”

Stottlemyer also explained that
the award is especially impressive
since the EWL is one of the nation’s
top conferences. Fourteen of the 36
EWL wrestlers who qualified for
NCAAS went on to become All-
Americans.

The Pitt men’s rugby team par-
ticipated in the Pittsburgh City
Tournament this weekend. They
played three games and finished
second in the tournament behind
Sidney-Brockport College from
New York.

The Panthers opened the day
against a rag-tag team, created from
people from other teams just to fill
out the tournament. Pitt scored first
and had a pretty easy time of it from
there.

They played all of their players
in this game, Coach Dan Talbert
said. The Panthers went on to win,
20-12. The score indicates a closer
game than it really was. The subs
kept the score low, but the Panthers
were in control most of the after-
noon.

The second game pitted the
Panthers against Clairfield. The
Panthers once again came out on
top, 32-0. Pitt dominated this game
from the start. Again, the scoring
started early, which seemed to be
their key to victory this weekend.
With wins such as these, Talbert’s
job was easy.

Pitt was matched up against
Sidney-Brockport in the finals.
Sidney-Brockport struck first, about
ten minutes into the game. The

THE PITT NEWS ‘I ‘I

Rugby takes second at
Pittsburgh City Tourney

Panthers were able to tie the game
at five just before halftime.
Sidney-Brockport scored on a
penalty kick early in the second half
to give them an 8-5 advantage. They
punched it in on the try zone again

to widen the gap to 15-5 after the

conversion kick.

Pitt was able to muster a late

score during injury time to pull to
within three. This turned out to be
the last play of the game.

Pitt had played all day and came
out ﬂat, according to senior captain
Rob Mailliard. The Panthers had
done most of the scoring the rest of
the day but were held at bay during
the final game. I

“They scored first, and we just
couldn’t get it in gear,” Mailliard
said. “We just couldn’t get a rhythm
going.”

Apparently, the Panthers need to
score first to win if the results of the
day hold true.

Both Mailliard and Talbert
agreed that over the whole weekend,
the Panthers played the best they
had all season. The Panthers will try
to improve on their performance
when they travel to the Ohio Classic
Tournament next weekend in
Columbus.

The Columbus tourney will be
the team’s last this year. An alumni
game on April 19, marks the official
end to the season.

 

was, the lasting memory of his final
stint in the NBA will always be him
pushing around a referee, just days
after he publicly blasted teammate
Nick Van Exel for doing the exact
same thing.

Of course, that doesn’t detract
from the decade’s worth of basketball
that made Magic a shoe-in for the
Hall of Fame to begin with.
Unfortunately, Magic didn’t know
when to call it quits. Now, he’s paying
for his pride.

Magic blew his shot at going into
the Hall of Fame with Bird when he

 FROM PAGE 9 

decided to un—retire. Several times.
With the good news about his HIV
infection, there’s no reason to believe
that Magic won’t be around in five
years for his induction ceremony, so
there’s no reason to let him in early.
There are players even greater than
Magic in the Hall of Fame, and they
all had to wait to get in. By fighting
for an exemption, Magic only adds
one more pitiful chapter to an already
sad story.
