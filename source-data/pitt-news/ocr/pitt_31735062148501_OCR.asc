should adopt a policy of complete
(military and economic) isolation
toward all nations outside the west-
ern hemisphere in armed interna-
tional or civil conflict.”

Representatives of John Carroll
university will come here during
the spring to meet members of the
Men’s Debating Association in a
debate on another standard debate
question.

Two debating teams sponsored by
Women’s Speech Association will
fac-e Allegheny teams tomorrow at
3 o’clock on the twelfth ﬂoor.

solved: That the basic blame for the
present European War rests upon
the Allied Powers,” Lillian Clark,
C40, and Regina Heinz, C40, will
vie with the visiting affirmative
team. Mary Evelyn Hopkins, C40,
and Anna Tumpane, Ed4l, will de-
fend the afﬁrmitive against the
other Allegheny team. Estlier Mar-
cuson, C41, will act as chairman.

After the debates there willrbe a

tea given by Women’s Speech Asso-
ciation in 1201 Cathedral.

Humor Moises Broad Survey

Of World industrial Research

By Mary Sutphen
Scientiﬁc investigation was in general more beneﬁcial and helpful to
industry in 1.939 than ever before, despite the war and world disturbances.

This is the theme used by William
A. Hamor, assistant director of Mel-
lon Institute in a scholarly-written,
comprehensive survey of world in-
dustrial research for the new edi-
tion of “Industrial and Engineering
Chemistry.”

Mr. Hamor takes up the entire
ﬁeld of industrial research in the
United States and other countries,
and includes the manufacture of
plastics, industrial hygiene, glass
technology, textiles, metallurgy, etc.
The main advances have been in the
fields of synthetic organic chemistry,
fine chemicals, plastics, and textile
fibers.

The need of warring countries for
synthetic materials, fuel, and plas-
tics has brought many new discov-
eries in these ﬁelds. For instance,
nylon, the new Du Pont synthetic
silk, may be used for parachute ma-
terial, cellulose acetate is used for
soldiers’ goggles, and in Germany
synthetic wool is being made of po-
tato leaves.

Among the most signiﬁcant and
important American discoveries of
the year are the new safety glass for
automobiles, ﬁber glass which dif-
fuses lights, a new synthetic camph-
or which has broken Japan's mo-
nopoly on camphor, and 11371011 Silk
which again threatens a Japanese
monopoly. The Mellon Institute’s
own discovery is tenderay, a process
which increases the tenderness and
juiciness of beef.

Europe, Great Britain and Ger-
many have made the most important
contributions to industrial progress.
Most of these discoveries are adapt-
ed for use in the waar.

In G—e1~n';any, a great deal. Of fuel,
food and materials are being made
wholly or partially synthetic. Mr.
Hamor points out, however, that
Germany’s conquest of Poland and
Czecho-Slovakia has given her im-
portant mineral and oil reserves.
England is less dependent on substi-
tute products, but she too, has ex-
perimented with plastics and syn-
thetic products.

Adieu
News Bids Farewell
To Faithful Servant

One of the oldest contributors to
University student publications left
the campus this week.

Pounding out articles for the Pitt
News, the Panther, and the Owl for
over six student generations here
at Pitt, the faithful servant rang
up his last “30” on Friday with a
ﬁnal article for the News which
appeared in today’s issue.

“Remmie,” as his friends called
him, never took any courses at the
University but often donated his
time to whipping out an English
theme or batting out a term paper
for a friend.

He originally made his headquar-
tors in the old Y hut, then moved
to the seventh ﬂoor of the Cathedral,
sat around the eighth floor for a
while, was transferred to the thir-
teenth, and then back to the eighth.

Reason given for his expulsion
from the University was that he
was getting too noisy and unreliable
in his old age.

DR. ELMER D. GRAPER
addresses ICG

ICG lliefeting
Features Talk
By Dr. Graper

The Un:iversity’s delegation to a
model political convention will be
organized this afternoon in 132 Ca-
thedral at 3:30 o’clock at a mass
meeting sponsored by the Intercol-
legiate Conference on Government.

Featuring an address by Dr. Elm-
er D. Graper, professor and head of
the department of political science,
today’s conclave will climax the ef-
forts of local ICG leaders to develop
this year’s delegation to the student
legislative group which meets in
Harrisburg the week-end of
April 18.

In charge of the meeting will be
Sam Rodgers, C41, chairman of the
local delegation, and Be1’nard‘lVic-

Kenna, ’39, graduate assistant ir{p‘cs—“

litical science, faculty adviser to the
group.

Genevieve Blatt, ’33, ICG execu-
tive director, who is a former fac-
ulty member of the political science
department and former wo-men’s de-
bate coach, will explain the general
workings of the conference to the
assembly, Rodgers states. Other
speakers include Beth Howard, jun-
ior at PCW, ICG regional director
for this district; Esther Marcuson,
C41, assistant chairman. of the local
unit; and McKenna.

Purpose of the meeting which is

open to any student, according to
Rodgers, is to acquaint University
students with the aims and work-
ings of the ICG, an organization of
over 30 Pennsylvania colleges and
universities which annually meets
in the state capital buildings to
dramatize some phase of govern-
mental activity.-

Alumni Attend

versary of the founding of the Uni-
versity.

Featured on the program of en-
tertainment for the evening, pre-
pared by George Stewart, ’20, chair-
man, will be tours of the Cathedral
for alumni who have not seen the
progress made toward completion
of the building. Guides will be
provided for the tours which will
begin at 7 o’c1o-ck at the office of

Women Will inaugurate
Formal Rushing Season

At Parties Tomorrow

Eligible Freshman, Upperclass Coeds Receive
Invitations to Fraternity-Sponsored Aﬂairs

By Regina Heinz
_ Despite the quixotic explanation of Wo1nen’s fraternity rush-
ing that appeared Sunday 111 a downtown newspaper, women at
the University wlllparticipato in the traditional procedure as laid
down by Panhellenic Council when their formal rushing season be-

gins tomorrow.

All rushees have already re-
ceived their invitations for to-
morrow afternoon and eveiiing
and Friday evening parties. By
9:30 o-’c1ock Friday invitations for
the Saturday morning and evening
affairs will be in the officer of the
dean of women where they may be
called for by the rushees. The lat-
ter must be answered on the forms
enclosed with them by 5 o’clock
Friday.

Leap Year’s Day

Fraternities have not released
plans for their individual parties,
since the practice is contrary to a
nationally recognized Panhellenic
ruling’. However, each group is
boasting that its affairs will be
unique or particularly impressive.
That the first day is Leap Year’s
Day may be a clue to some of the
themes.

The times for the five parties as
stipulated by Panhellenic Council
are:

Thursday: 12:30 to 2:30; 5:3'o

to 9:30.
Friday: 5:00 to 9:30.
Saturday: 10:00 to 2:00; 5:30
to 12:30.
All orientation classes except

those for February freshmen are
being dismissed for the afternoon.
Fraternities are allowed one-half
hour to take rushees home.
Rushing Rules

-Rigiclly enforced -on this-eampusr. .-

is the ruling that a rushees may at-
tend only one party at a particular
time. No one is permitted to “go
from one party to another” despite
published statements.

Silence week begins Saturday
midnight and continues until noon,
March 9. During this time frater-
nity women will submit bid lists to
the office of the dean of women and
rushees will make their choices of
fraternities.

Pledging is scheduled to take
place Monday, March 11, for the
women who have been wearing the
ribbons of their respective fraterni-
ties during the day.

Open rushing season then begins,
extending from March 18 until the
end of the semester.

Quill Club Hears
Mayer, Hunter

Frederick P. Mayer, associate
professor of English, and J. Stewart
Hunter, instructor in English, to-
night will address Quill Club, hon-
orary, literary fraternity, on co-n-
temporary writers and writing.

George Hyde, C40, president, an-
nounces that the Ineeting will be
held in the eighth floor Men’s Tuck
Shop at 8 o’clock, and refreshments
will be served.

“Make Way For Tomorrow,”
starring Victor Moore, Fay Bainter,
and Beulah Bondi, will be shown
at tht Essefay Theater tomorrow in

o’clock. The feature deals with the
ﬁnancial insecurity of old age, and
grown children’s neglect of their
aged parents.

Graduate Describes War Censorship

“Somewhere in France, someone
is doing something or other.”

This bit of nonsense is typical of
the kind of article being sent from
the war zone in France, according
to James Eichelberger, ’38, former
graduate student assistant in po-
litical science at the University,
who spent six months last year re-
l70‘1"Eing for the Paris office of the
Chicago Tribune.

Yet in spite of the censorship
which imposes severe restrictions on
news writers, Eichelberger believes
that the censorship in France is
“gentlemanly,” when compared
with the operation of the German
and Russian censorships.

Eichelberger related his expe-
riences with the French censorship
at a dinner meeting of Pi Sigma

Alpha, honorary political science
fraternity, last Friday.

The French allow the writer to
see what is being deleted from his
stories, Eichelberger explained,
while the Russians and Germans
depend more upon blue-penciling
the article when it is ready for
transmission to foreign countries.

“There are always ways of fool-
ing the censor. It’s possible to get
in.1"orn~.ation out of any country with
censorship if you’re clever,” Etch-
elberger declared.

When the French began allowing
the movement of volunteer troops to
Finland, he explained that corre-
spondents in France ﬁled stories of
the growing popularity of winter
sports, adding innocent paragraphs
which told of tourists leaving for

Scandinavian countries.

“In spite of American suspicions
of the perﬁdious British. the Eng-
lish don’t censor political or diplo-
matic dispatches as strictly as the
Fx‘encl1,” Eichelberger said.

In France, he pointed out, the
motion pictures “The Last 0f the
Mohicans” and “Drums” were sup-
pressed, the first because it depicted
battles between the English and
French, and the other because it
showed scenes of revolt in England’s
colonial empire.

Censorship within France for-
bids any discussion of the war aims
of the allies or French relations
with Italy, because of the political

importance of these two questions,
he reported.

Lab for Social
Science Students

A laboratory for social science classes is again
organizing on the Pitt campus with the Intercol-
legiate Conference on Government issuing its an-
nual call for University delegates.

‘Ne are interested i11 the progmlltl Of the ICG
this year; and not simply because it is a state-wide
activity attracting what their publicity ofﬁce calls
“the best political science students in Pennsylva-
nia.” Ratlier we are watching what action these
students v..'il_l take in drafting a model political
platform and nominating whom they consider a
“model” candidate for the presidency.

We womler exactly to what extent these po-
litical science and economics students will put into
practical use the theories which they soak in dur-
ing class lectures.

"We recognize that the ICC is about the only
agency available to dramatize the material from
textbooks and lecture notes. \Ve see in the ICC a
challenge to Pitt students-—a stage where our
delegates can publicly demonstrate what they can
do with political philosophy when exposed to prac-
tical realities in this annual experiment in “test
tube” government.

Let’s Forget
The Bed Scare

We say forget the Communists. Like ghosts,
nearly everyone talks about them, nearly everyone
is afraid of them, but few people have actually
seen one.

If half the effort that is put into red scaring
were put into solving the problems of our society,
we should be a thousand times better off. And the
Communists would have nothing to “make the
world better than.”

And don’t believe the cartoon descriptions of a
Communist. VVe have met a couple in our ‘time.
No beards, no bombs; very disappointing.

The Pitt News-

The 1-]? Ball
Reports a Profit

For the first time in four years, the Interfrater-

nity B-all has not reported a loss. According to a

statement by chairman Al Eger, the University’s
most consistently money—losing dance has reversed
its usual form, made a proﬁt of some $200.

To the sponsors of large-scale University dances,
this news means that it is possible to pay a “big
3131119” band and still plan a ﬁnancially successful
affair.

To Interfraternity Council, this news means
that the LE Ball can stay out of the red in the fu-
ture if it is carefully managed.

To the 13 men’s social fraternities, this
news means that the old system of special as-
sessments against the houses to cover the deﬁcits
of unsuccessful I-F a.ft’airs is gone, replaced by a
ticket quota system which assures adequate sup-
port in advance of the dance.

To this year’s chairman, this news means that
he has overcome a four-year bugaboo, done a
highly creditable job of dance-management.

To Seniors Who
Feel Out of Season

The sun is ashinin’ to welcome the spring, and
with it comes nostalgia. For the park will soon
begin its annual call; and there will be pleasant
afternoons of talk over the bars, and more of
pleasant evenings with her or him . . . for it will
soon be spring. Spring again; spring for the little
freshman, for the brash sophomore, for the ambi-
tious junior; it’s the last spring for the tired senior.

All of this is to remind the tired senior that
before he or she settles down to the glorious ﬁnal
spring, he or she had better make application for
graduation before Friday. Else it won’t be the
glorious ﬁnal Springtime.

Columnist Decides to Turn

[This is Mr. Kalwary’s farewell appearance in the 9088113 ﬁ€ld- And

he is very happy about the whole thing.

Beginning with next Wednes-

——Kal’s note.]

By Kal Kalwary

This is my very ﬁrst sickroom newspaper piece .

. For the past

two wks I faithfully fed bad gin—tasting concoctions to what my medico
called “bronchitis” and “bronchial pneumonia” on alternate days .
Since my reading was limited by order of the MD, my bedside radio was

on most of the day . . .

Well, sir, that’s a real and incomparable adventure . .

I lent my ears to such gosh-awful
story plots . . Tripe direct from
the nation’s leading baking powder,
soap, and cereal companies .

All sizes and shapes of inane dra-
mas, each peddling some syrupy
philosophy, for the gullible middle-
class housewife.

The breakdown of western civil-
ization is not far off, Aldous Hux-
ley tells us . . . But, we don’t
have to be told . . Listening to
“Life Can Be Beautiful,” “Woman
of Courage,” “The Goldbergs,”

“Orphans of Divorce,” and the
like, we clearly see civilization
rapidly breaking up into bits small
enough for Red Cross contribu-
tions——for they accept the smallest!
. . You just haven’t lived until
you tune-in “John’s Other Wife!”

Only on Hearsay

Florence Goodside, dark-tressed
newcomer, I hear said, is getting
around, and with extraordinary
aplomb for a freshman . . Jerry
Hahn passes the word that she is
the intellectual type . . . But how

Tiny but terriﬁc Sam Camarata
has begun his well known limber-
ing-up exercises for the C&G chorus
. . . Handsome “Ham” Hamilton’s
honey—-Maryburt Murbacher——is up
and about once again . . . Joe Mc-
Cormick is a full-ﬂedge senior . . .
This is the first year since he has
been here that Barnsboro’s favor-
ite son has had no romantic en-
tanglements!

. . Cassiano can’t make up his

mind whether he should pay dues
to the Pi Lams or the Phi Kaps!

Frank Miller, the guy with the
gags and card tricks, has become

the freshman gals’ delight .

Gerty Foreman may only be see-
ing a little more of a certain tall

Commons Room citizen than any

other Pittman, but for some odd

reason she includes his pearl club
pin in her daily attire.

Hoeveler Throws CL!

Contrary to the ugly rumors rid-
ing the elevators, Nancy Welfer is
democratic . . She talks to me!

Conant Gives
‘Seven Year
Unit’ Plan

CAMBRIDGE, MASS.—(ACP)-—-
Education should be liberalized by
having the seven or eight year ed-

ucation of the professional man
planned as a unit.
This is the proposal of James-

Bryant Conant, president of Harv-
ard university, as “an attempt to
get away from the ‘pre-professional’
idea in college.”

Speciﬁcally, he asks that the med-
ical schools admit men provisionally
in their second year on the basis of
work done as freshmen.

“After that,” Conant explained,
“the man could develop on a cul-
tural pattern determined by the
graduate school and the college ad-
ministrators.” Such an arrange-
ment would remove the impulse
of the student to overconcentrate in
the sciences in order to impress the
graduate school admission commit-
tee. It was understood that the sug-
gestions were equally applicable to

ence, rather than in practicing.

Dean Reviews
Fraternities
In Post Article

Fraternities hit the headlines
again today——this time! in an article
by Fred H. Turner, dean of the
University of Illinois, in a Saturday
Evening Post article called “—And
Some Are Chosen.”

Presenting case histories which
he has encountered as dean of men
at Illinois, Mr, Turner presents a
picture of the beneﬁts and detri-
ments which the sorority or fra-
ternity will give to the individual
depending on the individual, the
parents, help extended by the deans
of men and women, and the view-
point of the fraternity or sorority
itself.

High School BMOC’s

Given some worthwhile notice in
the article are the high school
BM&BWOC’s who arrive at col-
lege thinking they will have the
entire campus Greek population
twined around their ﬁngers after
the ﬁrst day or two.

As for the age-old collegiate
question of fraternities vs inde-
pendents in campus positions, he
presents the argument that the fra-
ternities watch for students who are
outstanding in activities to add to
their list of members, and subse-
quently the balance! of Phi Beta
K.appa’s, ODK’s, Mortar Boards, and
the like, will naturally be to the
advantage of the Greeks. But, he
adds, this does not imply that no
independents get these honors.
Fraternities Well Established

Says Mr. Turner, “Fraternity or
sorority life is not essential-to the
student, but if these is no fratern-
ity or sorority life there will be a
substitute for it in some form,
either dormitories, organized houses
or group systems.

“Fraternities and sororities are
well established and are trying to
do their share not to make the in-
stitutions accept them but to make
themselves more acceptable to the
institution,” he points.

PiKA Bowlers
Oppose Amity
Club in Playoff

Newman Five Meets
Jerks Today in Finals
Of Floor Competition

Bowling will highlight the intra-
mural playoifs when the Pi Kappa
Alpha bowlers meet the Amity club
at 4:30 o’clock this afternoon.

The PiKA outﬁt has shown plenty
of ﬁne bowling, banking on Dittman,
Elling, Williams, DeRocher, and
Klingensmith to carry the load.
However, they will be minus the
services of Napier who graduated
in mid-semester. Napier bowled
consistently well for the fraternity
champs.

Amity will attempt to stem the
PiKA tide with Ed Murphy, Bill
Calhoun, Franchini, and Jack Hen-
ning.

The winner of the Amity-PiKA
contest will meet the lndustrials to-
Inorrow afternoon at 5:00 o’clock.
The following day the two losing
teams will meet.

Basketball will: have the title-de-
fending Newmans against the Jerks
this afternoon on the Trees floor to
determine which team will meet the
Phi Kaps. The comparative rec-
ords have the Jeks the stronger
on paper, for in their one-point win
over the Pitt club, they showed
themselves also to be strong defen-
sively.

The Newmans with a wealth of
good players will probably depend
upon Joe Kristufek, Phil Lynch,
Bennett, Dunn, and Snyder to carry
them to their second independent
tittle.

Fullback Ernie Bonelli, frosh
footballers Klotz and Malloy, and
Anania are expected to be in the
Jerks’ line-up at game time.

Pitt Spiked-Shoe
Brigade Competes
For IC-4A Crown

Established as a co-favorite in the
indoor ICAAAA championships,
Pitt track athletes make their third
trek of the season to Madison
Square Garden Saturday night.

According to New York newspa-
permen, pre—meet dope indicates
that the ﬁght for team honors will
center among Pitt, New York U,
Manhattan, and Princeton. Strong
relay squads place the Violets and
Jaspers in contending positions,
while the Tigers’ strength lies in
leading individual threats.

Panther hopes were given quite a
boost last Saturday when the Olson-
coached cindermen broke out in a
rash of record-shattering perform-
ances in the indoor championships.
Under conditions that would or-
dinarily thwart even the greatest
track men, they came very close to
the top marks the eastern collegiate
stars have been turning in at the
Garden.

Dave McDowel1’s ascendancy to
the Pitt high jump throne places
him in a spot to upset defending
champ Artie Byrnes of Manhattan
in the high jump. Frank Ohl and
Bill Carter can both make it hot for
Anson Perina of Princeton, defend-
ing broad jump titlist.

Panther Cagers Face
Fordham in New York

Team, Coach Hope for Officiating Break
At Gotham after F racas on Tartan Floor

In the ﬁrst battle o-f a Madison
Square Garden dual basketball bill,
coach Carlson’s Panther quintet
faces Fordham before an expected
crowd of 10,000 fans this evening.

The two teams met last year in
the spacious Garden with the Blue
and Gold going away at the gun by
the score of 40-34. Pitt’s “sopho-
more wonders” ﬂashed a brilliant
attack last year which held enthu-
siastic fans on the edge of their
seats.

Rams Strengthened

Several promising recruits have
have added strength to the Ram
roster. Though the Fordham aggre-
gation has lost a majority of their
games, they have always been a
pesty quintet before rabid home
town admirers.

As an added attraction, fans from
the Skyscraper City will see
Georgetown attempt to batter
through the stiff defenses of unde-
feated N. Y. U. The Violets have
stolen Long Island’s thunder this
by virtue of their 12 consecutive
wins.

Due to their defeat at the hands
of a scrappy Tartan quintet, the
Blue and Gold are even—stephen
once again as far as wins and losses
are concerned. Their record shows
seven wins and seven losses.

On: the short end of the score
only twice during the entire eve-
ning, the Panthers amazed every-
one Saturday night when they fell
victims to revenge-stimulated Skibo
team.

'.l‘arta.n.s Pull Surprise

The game was decided with but
four seconds to play when chunky
Jim Tumpane managed to grab
Scherer’s tip-off? and convert it into
a ﬁeld goal. Red Port had no more
than tossed the ball back into the
court when the game was over, and
Tech held the advantage, 46-44.

The Carl.sonmen hope for a better
break from the Garden ofﬁcials than
they received from Hetra and Mont-
gomery in the Tech c].ash. Previous
experiences with Hetra in the

Waynesburg and Geneva battles
were none too satisfying, and the
Farrell arbiter fairly outdid him-
self with his watchfulness Satur-
day.

Ed Straloski and Sam Milanovich
each lasted about eight minutes be-
fore drawing their fourth personal
fouls. In that time Straloski had
one shot from the ﬂoor, which he
missed, and Milanovich came
through with exactly one less than
Straloski.

The complaint of Pitt partisans
was not that the ofﬁcials called “raw
ones” on the Panthers, but rather
that they frequently ignored the
Tartan rule infringements.

Members of the squad enroute to
the “big city” are: Mel Port, Charley
Ptacek, Eddie Straloski, Lefty Zil-

Jimmie Klein, Sam Milanovich,

that should prove interesting since
both teams are smarting from recent

I going to get a job?” he is called
up to the employment oﬁice and
told how. The employment prob-
lem really isn’t as simple as all
that, but the bureau has continued
throughout the depression as one of
the University’s most successful
services.

Reorganized in 1933

Under the system put into effect
with the reorganization in 1933, the
bureau is made up of three sepa-
rate branches, the senior division,
the alumni division, and the part-
time division. The ﬁrst two of
these are combined under the same
administration into what is known
as the “full time” division; the lat-
ter division which concerns itself
with student employment was dis-
cussed in a previous story.

Early in the school year, each
registered senior is sent an applica-
tion blank from the bureau with the
request that he appear for a person-
al interview with Mr. Williams.
Both applicant and interviewer are
given an opportunity to become ac-

ing personal contacts with ﬁrms in
and near Pittsburgh, he speaks to
inﬂuential alumni and business
groups to publicize his bureau.

~ Mr. Williams has received enthu-
siastic response from national or-
ganizations in ﬁelds such as insur-
ance, marketing, petroleum, rubber,
steel, chemistry, electricity, and
utilities. Since 1933 these com-
panies have made a greater demand
for engineers than for other types
of students.
Employment Record

The bureau attempts to keep an
accurate record of the employment
status of every senior and alumnus
who has registered for employment
consideration. In this way, there
has been built up an extensive ﬁle
of available men who are experi-
enced in their respective ﬁelds. Out
of 117 placements from 1933 to
1937, 53' men were in this category.

Over 75 per cent of the men Mr.
Williams "AS placed are alumni.
Also included in the bureau’s ﬁles
are men who, through ﬁnancial or

provement in his last two years will
be made by Pi Tau Phi, scholastic
fraternity in the College. The Mar-
garet Enright Memorial award,
sponsored by Theta Phi Alpha, wo-
men’s social fraternity, will be pre-
sented to a woman student of high
scholarship—ranking and leadership
in activities.

Two fraternity women of high
scholastic attainment will be hon-
ored by awards from the Panhel-
lenic Council. To encourage schol-
arship among freshman women,
Mortar Board, honorary activities
