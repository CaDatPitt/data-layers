Restoring trust and respect in
public safety, overseeing Pitt’s
housing and food services and
revamping the parking system at
Pitt will be the responsibilities of
newly appointed vice chancellor
for business John DeVitto.

Senior Vice Chancellor for
Business and Finance Ben T uchi
has hired his former University of
North Carolina colleague to
oversee the departments of
housing and food aervices, public
aafety and parking and
transportation.

.“It will be his job to make sure
people at Pitt don’t feel insecure
going to a parking spot,” Tuchi
said. "lHe also] must do what is
necessary to revamp the parking
system at Pitt so that parking
passes are distributed fairly, and
most importantly, to re—negotiate
parking contracts with private
vendors.”

A tombstone has recently been unearthed by construction workers behind the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon Fraternity house adjacent to Sutherland Hall, the new residence hall complex behind Pitt
Stadium scheduled to open this fall. ' ‘

According to fraternity members,’ the tombstone was discovered Tues
carving out a hillside located behind the house during preparation for the construction of a new
back patio. The patio is being built as part of an agreement with the university for building the
new residence hall next to the fraternity.

0 ’Connor
calls for
changes
in attitude

By Gary Knapick
and Julie Sabol
T be Pitt News

Recognizing “a profound need
for better communication among
all constituents of the university”
and realizing that the
responsibility for changing the
“institutional culture" rests with
him, Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor invited university staff
members to offer suggestions for
change during the Staff
Association Council’s annual
Summer General Assembly.

But first O’Connor presented
some suggestions of his own.

“We’re going to try like hell to
get changes in attitudes.  We all
need to develop those human
qualities that make the workplace
a place you want to  O’Connor
said. “There is a new cast of
people operating in the Cathedral
and on campus there have
been changes as far as
responsibilities being assigned
to individuals.”

It takes more than people-
shufﬂing to bring about change,
O’Connor reminded the
assembly. “You can change
structures, you can make systems
more efficient, but you've got to
put care into the job.”

O’Connor also addressed the
need for a new atmosphere within
the university.

“There is, I fear, in certain

and designed a workable parking
system at the university. Before
his UNC position, he served in
the military as director of food
services for an army base.

“I’m anxious to be working-
with everyone up there. The
people I’ve met and talked to are
a tremendous group of
individuals. I’m looking forward
to working with the entire
university community,” DeVitto

said.

Questions concerning the circumstances of
Jeffrey Romoffs appointment to the newly created
position of senior vice chancellor of health
administration were raised at the Senate Council
meeting Monday.

Certain procedures were bypassed in Romoffs
appointment to vice chancellor, according to
University Senate President James Holland.

“That is a major change in the organization and

structure of the university, to have such a position,”
Holland said. “That seems to me to involve a
review process. The position itself required
discussion and input. Given that you have a senior
vice chancellor—level appointment, there are
proscribed procedures in which the chancellor
appoints some search committee members and the
Senate appoints some search committee members,
and then they doa national search. It’s a careful,

involved process.”

human compassion in the
workplace.

“Now that the structure has
been changed, now that the
people are on board, I would
like very much to increase the
sensitivity of the individuals in
management positions so that
they, along with [staff members]
 can create a workplace that is
compassionate, that is humane,
that is fair,” O’Connor said.

Cuts in state funding reﬂect hard economic times says Tuchi

By Jim Lakely
Sports Editor

A 3.5 percent cut in state funds to the
University of Pittsburgh reflects
Pennsylvania’s hard economic times and a
tightening of budgetary belts across the
board, according to Senior Vice Chancellor
for Business and Finance Ben T uchi.

“We know the state is in difficult times,
so we want to do our share to help,” Tuchi
said. “[The cuts were] pretty much what
we expected, but this is not a good sign for
the future.”

Pitt has been allocated $135.1 million in
basic state appropriations for the fiscal

year 1993, which began onJuly 1. Western
Psychiatric Institute 8: Clinic will receive
$7.7 million, with an additional $497,000
for its teen suicide center.Also included in
the revised budget, signed by Gov. Robert
Casey on July 2, is $119.3 million for
educational and general expenses, $6.2
million for Pitt’s medical school and $1.03
million for the dental school.

Pitt’s Board of Trustees has direct final
authority in budgetary decisions, and it
will be T uchi’s job to make this budget
work yet keep “after the fact” financial
decisions as painless as possible. This
could include cutting salaries, he said.

Tuchi said interplay between himself :

' and the the Board of Trustees when making

budgetary decisions, is crucial.
Projections as to what percentage of
Pitt’s state allocations would be cut have
varied over the past year. State Sen. Mike
Fisher said Casey's original" proposal was a
4.2 percent cut in allocations for Pitt, but
Fisher sponsored a bill ensuring that the

cuts would come in line with other state '

schools at a 3.5 percent cut.

“When I came here in June,” Tuchi said,
“the handwriting was on the wall as far as
what we expected in budget cuts. 3.5
percent is $5 million. That is a large pill to
swallow.” ‘

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor has

said great lengths would be taken to
ensure that tuition is not increased more
than 6 percent next year. Tuchi said he
doesn’t anticipate that promise being
broken.

The state’s promise to deliver $135.1
million dollars to Pitt is no guarantee that
Pitt will receive the money, T uchi said.

“I have never been in a state where all
the money comes in budgetwise,” T uchi
said. “It is not surprising [to not receive all
funds promised]. In North Carolina they
were never able to deliver on the budget.
It is easy to say that delivery is going to be
a bit shy of expectations. The question is,
‘What bur.”

Recognizing and encouraging
young chemists from all over the
world, Pitt Provost Donald
Henderson welcomed part-
icipants to the 24th International
Chemistry Olympiad being held
at Pitt and Carnegie Mellon this
week.

“I’m especially pleased to
welcome you young people who
are participating  and I want
you to know how proud I am of
you, of your accomplishments
and what brought you here.
That’s what we are all about at
this institution. We’re about
achievement, and you reﬂect the
basic fundamental values and
aspirations of our institution,”
Henderson said. '

The International Chemistry
Olympiad has a proud tradition
of recognizing and encouraging
the most promising young
IChO
International Jury Chairperson
David Lavallee said.

The Olympiad consists of a
variety of events, including
written exams, five—hour
laboratory practical exams and
Cooperative Team Events.

The Cooperative Team Events
are designed to foster a sense of
international cooperation,
according to the American
Chemical Society-news bureau.
The competing teams are made
up of ﬁve members, none of
whom may speak the same
language. ' .

In the beaker relay race, teams
try to complete a relay race in the
shortest time and must have a
minimum of 400 milliliters of
water in the relayed beaker at all
times.

Teams construct the tallest free-
standing model of a diamond
crystal in another team event.

Though it is an olympiad,
chemists not only compete
throughout the week, they also

‘attend lectures and tour the

area.

Speakers at the program
include Lavallee, American
Chemical Society President Ernest

Eliel, Henderson and City Council
President Jack Wagner.

“To the olympians  one of my
favorite quotes is ‘Small minds
talk about people, average minds
talk about events, great minds
talk about ideas.’ When I look at
all of you young people, I think
of ideas. And truly, in this very
complex world we live in, we
need you.

"You are the future of our world.
We depend on you,” Wagner
said at Sunday’s opening
ceremony.

The chemistry olympiad began
in 1968 with only three nations:
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and
Poland, Lavallee said. ,

“This year we have the highest
number of participating de-
legations ever, 33. These
delegations include very many
new nations that did not exist
when the first olympiad took
place,” he said.

This year students from Korea,
Mexico and Taiwan are
competing for the first time.
Observers from Israel and
Venezuela are also attending,

  

, elnternational chemists meet at Pitt for Olympiad  

Lavallee said.

This is the first year that the
IChO has been held outside of
Europe and the 24th year since
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and
Poland created the Olympiad in
1968, according to the ACS.

“The original Pittsburgh‘

proposal was written in 1988 
lItl' described the coalition of
public— and private—sector
representatives who were

committed to the idea that no,

other city in our country could
provide the human resources and
the facilities that are required to

make this event a success,” Local ‘

Organizing Director for ‘IChO
and Pitt Associate Dean of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences W.
Richard Howe said.

The United States team won
one gold, one silver and two
bronze medals and came in fifth
among the 30 nations part-
icipating in last year’s olympiad
in Lodz, Poland. The United States
has won three gold, 13 silver and
12 bronze medals ‘since it
competed for the first time in
1984, according to the ACS.

By Gary Knapick
Senior Sta_[)“ Writer

To his family, whose expectations for
his success as a businessperson were high
and whose appreciation of music and
poetry was minimal, he was at best a naive
genius. At worst, he was a complete
failure.

But to those who have tapped their toes
to “Oh! Susanna” or whistled the tuneof
“My Old Kentucky Home,” Stephen Foster’s
life was anything but squandered. And
while he may have died with 58 cents to
his name, his priceless songs of family,
selﬁdetermination and humanity served
to change and enrich a young nation.

The city that calls Foster its son is also "

home to the Stephen Foster Memorial,
located adjacent to the Cathedral of
Learning. The theater/museum/research
library houses an impressive array of
Foster memorabilia assembled-in large
part during the 19505 by Indianapolis
magnate Josiah Kirby Lilly, who felt “an
unpayable debt” to the songwriter.

The Foster Hall Collection, as it is known,
was presented to the University of
Pittsburgh in 1957. For the past 10 years,
its cataloging, finances, and preservation
have been the charges of curator Deane
Root.

Oakland cernetary datesback to Civil War

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, July”I5, 1992

 

By Pete Kapustynski

News Assistant

Soon after Pitt bought the eight-
acre Oakland Cemetery dated
back to the Civil War era that sat
on the Hill above Pitt Stadium,
the cemetery became the focus
of a seven—year legal battle.

In 1963, Pitt bought an unused
4,300 square foot section of the
cemetery and go_t the right to buy
the rest of the cemetery within a
year, according to the March 13,
1963, issue of The Pittsburgh
Press.

A snag developed in 1967 when
about 150 people came to
Common Pleas Court to protest
the moving of the bodies from
Oakland Cemetery to Mt. Royal
Cemetery in Glenshaw. Pitt
offered to move all ofthe graves
at the university’s expense, but

some plot owners did not want
their plots to be ‘moved to Mt.
Royal Cemetery. A petition
seeking approval of Pitt’s offer
was presented for the FirstTrinity
Evangelical Lutheran Church,
according to the September 7,
1967, issue of 7hePittsbu1gh Post-
Gazette.

According to the May 8, 1969,
issue of the Post-Gazette, Pitt
offered to pay plot owners who
did not want relatives’ remains
moved to Mt. Royal Cemetery.
Pitt offered $225 per grave and
$60 per unused plot. Protesters
said this was an unfair price.

In the closing hours of a hearing
in Common Pleas Court, Pitt
increased its previous offer to
$400 per grave and $100 per
unused plot to those who did not
want their plots moved to Mt.
Royal Cemetery, according to

Pitt won its seven-year battle

could begin as soon as possible,

according to the June 12, 1970,

according to the same article.

Following an appeal, Pitt once
again received approval to move
the bodies, according to the

When the moving began,
bodies were discoveredwhere
no graves were thought to exist,

The tombstone is that of an

Matt Major, the stone was taken
by construction workers
yesterday from the fraternity’s
chapter room without notice.

Construction workers would
not comment on the
whereabouts of the stone when
questioned yesterday.

Chris Lucchese of SAE said he
thinks the marker discovered by
workers wasn’t the only one.

“A worker told me Thursday
while he was working on the

there were four more discovered
and that they were taken away
soon after they were dug up,”
Lucchese said.

The gravestones appear to be
remnants of Oakland Cemetery,
a six-acre graveyard dating back
to the Civil War, which the
university bought from the First
Trinity Lutheran Church in

Oakland after a long court battle 1

from 1963 to 1972.
Approximately 5, S00 bodies and
1,420 markers were relocated
by the university as part of a
settlement with parishioners of
the church who were related to
the dead, according to the March

Clintonﬁnds
support at NY
convention

By Beth Kovaly
For The Pitt News

Thousands of delegates and
spectators alike gathered in
Manhattan as the 41st
Democratic National Con-
vention began Monday.

Clinton’s campaign office has
stated that it is using the
convention to “reintroduce”
Clinton.

Former Democratic Party
Chairperson John White said
Clinton will try to bring a more
personal side to major issues
and to focus attention on the
middle-class American people,
who, according to Clinton’s
office, have had a feeling of
neglect from Bush and Reagan
the past 12 years.

The convention speeches
called for a change, labeling
Bush as an “out—of-touch”
president ready to leave the
White House in November.

“We are feeling really good
right now,” Assistant Press
Secretary for the Campaign for
Clinton Ethan Zindler said. “We
hope to see our campaign
message bring the Democratic
Party and the country together.
Our message puts the people
first, above all else. I can’t think
of any past candidate running
on such positive feelings as
Governor Bill Clinton.”

Most of the major democratic
figures have thrown their
support to Clinton. However
former Governor Jerry B‘rown
has not. Clinton’s office said
the convention is backing his
detailed plan calling for a
“reinvestment in the people.”

Other areas of the plan include
more affordable health care and
accessible education. '

“The popularity ratings show
that Governor Clinton" has the
best plan,” Zindler said. “It’s
giving back to the community.
You’re helping the community,
you’re helping yourself.”

Foster

Continued from page 3
perforated metal plates used by
old—fashioned mechanical pianos
to compact discs, testify to the
timelessness of Foster’s art. And
his music quite literally echoes
through the tall room, one familiar
tune after another.

Maintaining such a collection
is about as cheap as it is easy.

“Almost all funds for operations
have come from outside gifts and
grants. Historically that’s the way
it’s been. Of course a lot of things
have changed since the Carnegies
and Lillys of the world funded
these little pet projects,” Root
said.

Nevertheless, Root is confident
of the memorial’s financial
survival. “Over a period of eight
years, I've been able to raise over

$500,000 for specific projects,”.

Root said.

That amount includes money
for a public radio show featuring
Dear Friends, the memorial’s own
in—house musical ensemble,
and for the climate-control
system.

Because admission to the
museum is free, Root said the
main financial goal of the
museum is to simply recover
costs.

Root’s work immerses him in A

Foster’s life. Day after day he is
surrounded by books on, music
by and possessions of the man.
He’s gotten to know him.

“I am convinced that Foster
came to realize a sense of mission

in his work.

That mission has to do with
cleaning up the minstrels and
doing away with the degrading
caricatures of African Americans
on stage. Instead of ridiculing the
way someone who is not white
looks, he tried to get away from
that and say ‘Look! This is
humanity.’

“The popular image is that
Foster was an apologist for the
old—order South, but I think that
image stems from the family’s

attitude and the image they
painted.”

Foster relayed his opinions on
the politics of slavery through his
songs sung by African Americans,
Root said.

In “Nelly Was a Lady,” Foster
expressed his belief that a higher
human law overrides a state
law permitting slavery, Root
said.

“You really could do a political
deconstruction of that song. It
would be fascinating.”

History

Continued from page 4

“The university went through
an enormous amount of work
to try to go through the records,
identify every grave, transfer
every body, do everything that
possibly could be done to
preserve whatever dignity there
might be in the burial site  but
some bodies were found where

they weren’t supposed to be.
The university has no control
over it when that sort of thing
happens,” Permar said.

Two graves that were missed
when Pitt originally moved the
graves were found in 1986
during construction of a parking

DeVitto
Continued from page 1

“John knows what is expected
from him, and it’s a tall order,"
Tuchi said.

That tall order includes getting
Pitt’s newest residence hall,
Sutherland Hall, ready for the
start of classes, feeding 5,000
new students in August,
negotiating a new food-service
contract and negotiating contracts
with independent private parking
vendors, Tuchi said.

“These needs can't be expected
to be put on hold. They must be
addressed now,” Tuchi said.

Tuchi has been criticized for
filling an $84,000—per—year

position without conducting a
thorough nationwide search.
Such a search would take at least
12 to 16 weeks, and Tuchi said it
was more important to fill the
position quickly to ensure the
smooth operation of basic
university functions when classes
begin in the fall.

“Food services and the
transportation system and
housing all have to be revamped
and in place by August,” Tuchi
said. “I had to either devote all
my attention to that or find an
executive who would be able to
deliver in that position.

“Our students and faculty are V

going to expect that their
demands are met by the 15th of
August, and [if we went through
the normal search process], our
only answer would have been to
wait,” Tuchi said.

“[Those who criticize] don’t
have to be responsible for

service,” he said. “Critics who

focus on the search process push
off responsibility on producing
but will not stop criticizing. We
must move on the issues.”
DeVitto has already met with
Student Government Board
members to discuss his role in

the university.

“We have problems that need
to be dealt with immediately,
and someone who can get that
done has been appointed,”
Student Government Board
member Jacob Brody said.

“I am aware he just appointed
DeVitto, and although on
university policy I believe
searches are necessary, due to
the timeliness of the situation, I
understand it had to be done,”
Brody said.

Tuchi has known DeVitto well
for two and one-half years.
Devitto was his first choice to fill

within the university
administration, he did ask for
caution.“I really hope we can
have a year of moving ahead

signal for me is the
appointment of the senior vice
chancellor for health
administration,” Holland said.

In other business:
oVice Chancellor for Student
Activities William Harmon,
representing the Chancellor’s
Task Force on Safety and
Security, recommended
adding a $25 to $50
transportation fee to tuition to
pay for a new shuttle service.

said.

After the opening remarks, O’Connor, Senior Vice Chancellor for
Business and Finance Ben Tuchi, John Wilds from the office of the
vice chancellor for administration and University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center Vice President for Budget and Financial Planning
Jeffrey Masnick addressed staff questions submitted at the beginning
of the meeting on notecards. Audience members were also given the
opportunity to address questions directly to the panel.

“There is much fear among the staff of the medical school that they

will no longer be University of Pittsburgh employees,” read one
question. .

O’Connor attempted to allay the fears of the staffers. “UPMC is an
integral part of the university,” O’Connor said. “If you were to work
for UPMC, you would be working for the University of Pittsburgh.
T hat’s why we call it the UPMC.”

One concern expressed by staff members is that some employees
of Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic could be transferred to
Presbyterian University Hospital. Such transfers were made at one
time during the Posvar administration.

See Stafﬁ page 14

Harmon, the total amount of
money raised by this fee would

Voter participation blues

With national party conventions well under way, the
American voter will be treated to a spectacular show of
partisan politics. But behind all the fanfare and quick one-
liners from party elites, the American voter still remains an
apathetic, passive creature.

Organizations concerned about the democratic office,
such as the League of Women Voters, pushed the U.S.
Congress to pass legislation known as the “motor-voter”
bill.

The legislation called for all states to provide mail—in
voter registration cards, like the ones offered to the
Pennsylvanian voter. Other provisions provided citizens
withthe chance to register during a driver’s license
application process or even when applying for
unemployment, welfare or other government benefits.
Although such legislation would seem to have strong
support — it passed in the House and Senate with
bipartisan support — President Bush decided to veto the
legislation on July 2.

Bush maintained the legislation would lead to voter

‘ fraud. Even though the “motor-voter” bill added harsh

penalties for voter fraud, Bush crushed a simple and non-
controversial attempt to bring the voter-registration process
into this century.

In some states, voter registration is possible only by
registering at a county segt. For many Americans, this
forces citizens to travel miles to exercise a fundamental
right. ,

It could be argued that if a person does not take the time
to register to vote, it is only the fault of the individual. This
argument is disingenuous. Most. states, including
Pennsylvania, offer voter registration by mail. For Congress
to mandate such a simple procedure is only reasonable.

Motor—voter provisions exist in places such as Washington
and have not produced the fraud suggested by Bush.

Driving beyond “motor-voter,” states or Congress should
separate jury duty selections from the voter lists. Although
jury duty is anirnportant democratic function and cannot
be underscored, selecting potential jurors from registered
voters serves to discourage registering to vote.

When comparing voter turnout in the United States to
that ofWestern Europe and other democratic nations, our
country’s participation ranks extremely low. Some figures
suggest that only half of the eligible voters register. The
time for change is now. -

Bush’s uncalled-for veto demonstrates his lack of interest

 in an active and healthy democracy. Until Congress can
‘muster the votes to override any number of his vetoes,

Americans will only have the opportunity to push the
change state by state. ‘
In this campaign year, when politicians are trying to

offer voters significant issues to ponder, the “motor-,

voter” bill should be taken out of park and allowed to ride.

BEDILLION

It’s Friday night. You are

partying hard. You are drunk as .

a skunk, wasted and completely
under the table. You feel great.
Suddenly, a hush spreads over
the room. The Pittsburgh police
(who by the way, are at your
service) have arrived with a paddy
wagon. You live in the apartment
that the police are approaching.
What do you do? What do you
have to do?

What don’t you have _to do?
What are your rights, duties and
obligations at this point?

You had better know, or you
could wind up in jail for the

_ weekend and be faced with some

wicked ﬁnes. Allow me to offer
you some answers and advice.

Pittsburgh is not unique. Night
after night police officers across
the country must make on-the-
spot decisions. They are in a no-
win situation. If they ignore the
signs of a potential problem,
parents and residents berate them
for not doing enough to control
the situation.

If they come in and start busting
people, they become the sworn
enemies of the students. They are
seen as having nothing better to
do than to harass college kids
trying to have a good time. To
add to an already bad situation,
officers often find themselves face
to face with defiant individuals
who really don’t know the
boundaries of their rights and
responsibilities.

The first misconception most

students have is that the police

l'l€€Cl 3. S€3.I'Ch warrant [0 enter

"their homes.

They don ’t/ All the police need
is what is known as “probable
cause.” Probable cause is defined
by what a “reasonable, prudent
person” would think in a given
situation. In layperson’s terms it
goes something like this: the belief
or suspicion by a reasonable,

prudent person that a crime is

' being or is about to be committed.

In other words, if Joe Shmoe
were to stand outside your place

Bill
Kendall

on the street, would he, by what
he could hear, see or“ smell, be

‘ able to figure out whether or not

there was a party going on inside?
This is all the police need in order
to come into your place. Even if
everyone inside is over 21, they
could just as easily write you up
for a number of things. '

These include, but are not
limited to, disturbing the peace,
creating a public nuisance or
simple disorderly conduct (a
police favorite).

My advice to you in this situation
would be to let the police officers
in to do what they will. The
alternatives could be ugly.

They could force their way in
and create a panic when all
tinderaged people head out the
windows and back doors. If any
of them get hurt or caught in the
process, you could be liable.

The police officers could just
say OK to your refusal to let them
in, wait and cite each and every
person that leaves the place for
public drunkenness. Usually, the
more you cooperate, the more
they will overlook.

Again, usuallythey are just there ‘

to let you know that your party is
getting a bit loud and thatyou
need to either quiet things down
or break things up. Of course you
have the option of being
belligerent to them, in which case
they are more likely to come into
your home and start writing and
cuffing. A

These same standards apply

Police actions rnisunderstoodl

when one is driving a vehicle.
You need not necessarily speed

or run a stop sign to be pulled A C

over.

A police officer has every right
to pull you over for no other
reason than a broken brake light.
If the officer smells alcohol or any
other substance with an obvious
odor after pulling the car over,
the officer is permitted to ask you
to step‘ out of the car so the car
can be searched. The same criteria
aPP1v- .

If Joe Shmoe were standing
outside your car talking to you,
would he, by what he could see,
hear or smell, be able to figure
out if there were any illegal
activities going on? That is all the
suspicion that a police officer
needs.

In order to put this in
perspective, think about walking
up and down the streets of
Oakland at night on the weekend.
When you walk by a place, nine
times out of 10 it’s pretty obvious
whether or not a party is occurring.
Put yourself in the shoes of the
police officers —- now you know

why their patience can be so.

short sometimes when they come
to your door and you act as if
nothing is going on inside. All
they are doing is pursuing the
obvious. Often times it is not
even that. Often times they have
to come to your door (just
following procedure) because of
the amount of calls from angry

P neighbors.

So the next time you find
yourself face to face with one of

Pittsburgh’s finest, consider what "

you have learned. here. It could
save you a lot of miserable time
and wasted money. I know, I’ve
been there.

Environmental follies

 

THE prrr NEWS, Wednesday, June 17, 1992

“Save the ?” campaign puts life on theearth in perspective

It was just a matter of time
before the first backlash against
the environmental movement
arrived. Like every topic, it has
two sides. George Carlin’s new
HBO special presents the second
and more realistic side. Although
my views are not as extreme as
Mr. Carlin’s, he makes some points
that cannot be ignored.

His general perspective mocks
human arrogance and stupidity.
The “Save the ?” movements and
the endangered-species lists are
paradigms of human arrogance.
For some reason, we as humans
feel the need to stick our noses
where they don't belong. Mother
Nature works in her own ways
and does not need our help.

Over the past century humans
have developed the attitude of
the “protector” of troubled
species. I would really like to
know at what point nature
delegated this job to us. We are
just another type of organism to
nature; she does not share our

prejudice for more intelligent or

beautiful creatures. Over 95

percent of all species that have _

ever lived ‘on Earth are gone.
Humans did not kill them all.

This is exactly what nature does.
She takes species from the ‘Earth
and replaces them with new ones
(including humans).

I will never understand why
we feel it is our “duty” to interfere
with or disrupt a process that has
been going on for 4.2 billion
years. Species have evolved and
died out before us and will do so
after us, regardless of our
protection.

These points are all in the
abstract. They are counter-
arguments to the ideals that
motivate species—preservation
foundations. On a practical basis,
these foundations are such an
insult to our own species that it
makes me ill.

On any given day one can walk
the streets of any given city and
count dozens of people who have
nothing. They have no money,
food, clothing, shelter or hope.

There is no justification for saving
thewhales when humans cannot
sustain even the-poorest quality

. of life. It is time to start donating

those worthless dollars to
Tim L
Desmond

humans, not to some ocean life
that nature will handle herself.
Keep in mind that we are one of
the most prosperous countries in
the world. One cannot imagine
the human devastation in more
underprivileged areas.

Probably the most apparent
example of human arrogance and
stupidity is “Save The Planet.”
We are so arrogant that we will
not call it “Save The Humans.”
The only reason we want to save
the planet is because our own
existence has become a process
of extinction. If we do not take
care of the environment, humans
will perish —not the planet.

Humans have such an arrogant
outlook that we feel we are

I destroying the planet. I find it

hard to believe our 200 years of
industry is going to annihilate 4.2
billion years of existence. Using
a model of a day representing
the existence of the Earth,
humans have been around for
no more than one second. Yet
we think we are a threat to the
planet.

The Earth has survived volcanic
activity, earthquakes, recurring
ice ages, bombardment by
meteors and so on. Nature" has
killed off billions upon billions of
species, including such massive
creatures as the dinosaurs.
Aluminum cans and plastic bags
are not going to destroy the planet

,— maybe humans — but certainly

not the planet. These materials
came from the Earth and
eventually will be re-incorporated
into it. —

The environmental awakening
is actually a fear of human
extinction. Humans are just like

any other species.‘-Nature does
not discriminate; we evolved,
lived and will become extinct
like many species before us. “Save
The Planet” could be labeled as a
type of denial.

For those of you
environmentalists busy saving
feathered birds and marine life,
save your time.

Put your work to better use by
helping fellow humans who need

it more than some big fish. The _

planet will be around for a long
time after we are gone. Do not
even think for a moment that we
are a threat to the Earth’s
existence.

Mr. Carlin is certainly not a
renowned scientist, but you do
not have to be a scientist to get a
grip on reality. Keep your
priorities in focus; after all,
someday you could be homeless,
being_deprived of help because
of a bird or fish organization.

Tim Desmond is a columnist
forThe Pitt News.

Columnist misses point

I would like to alert Bill Kendall that opportunities for
women and minorities are not abound or even commonplace.
In the June 17 Pitt News Kendall asserts that claims of
workplace fairness are whines and hatched by crack-pots
with a conspiracy theory paranoia.

This is not the case at all. Women and racial minorities may
be at an all time high holding corporate positions, as Kendall
cites from the first-class publication, USA Today, but when
you examine thelower echelons of the wage-earning scale
women and racial minorities are abundant. Black
unemployment rates are roughly double [those] of whites,

Letters

according to USA Today. Women still make 59 cents to the
average male dollar because women as a group occupy
lower paying job positions. Opportunities for a few, lucky
and maybe even tokens does not translate into a better
environment for women and blacks.

Finally, the article is cluttered with strange anecdotes
about how women in Hollywood are well off because
Michelle Pfeiffer is Catwomen and Pat Schroeder is one of
the 20 some women in a House of Representatives that
outnumbers women 15 to 1. There is also a strange analogy
concerning some widget factory. Next time come up with a
better example and read a little more about a subject you
obviously know nothing about.

Edward Washington
CAS

Your June 17 editorial on Bill Clinton flatly asserted
“Women want pro—choice candidates."

As Linda Chavez pointed out this very week on the news
analysis program To the Contrary, the assumption that women
are pro—choice is simply unfounded. Polls repeatedly show
that women (like men) oppose abortion in most instances,
and'in fact, that [women] tend to be more pro—life than men.
The largest national pro—choice women’s organization, the
National Organization for Women [NOW], lists its membership
at about 250,000; yet the largest national pro—life women’s
organization, Concerned Women for America, has a
membership in excess of 600,000 -—— nearly 2 1/2 times that
of NOW (source: National Encyclopedia of Associations
1991). In the real world, as opposed to the world of media
hype, women are just as politically diverse as are men. Their
views on abortion, as on other issues, span the spectrum
from liberal to conservative...

End of summer reflections

As a departing graduate from these hallowed
' halls, I’ve begun reflecting on some of the things I
have and have not learned at Pitt.

The things I didn’t learn, like how to balance my
checkbook or how to split an atom, are easy to
identify, but some of the things I did learn have left
me angry, confused and skeptical.

Lessons about ineffectiveness and slow change
at the university weren’t nearly as painful as lessons
about the hate, homophobia and bigotry that exist
at Pitt and in the world around

and the Black Action Society receive. These callers
never seem to take into account that those two
groups are among the most active and strongest on
campus. ' V

I have seen the medical center grow larger and

Will Night On Earth push Jarmusch into the commercial ring?

By Alon Orstein
Staff Writer

Not many people outside
Manhattan’s Bohemian belt (14th
Street to Tribeca) and perhaps a
few Tokyo boardrooms have ever
heard of Jim Jarmusch. T hat’s all
right.I’d never heard of
Margarethe von Trotta before I
went to New York University’s
film school and people were just
as incredulous: “What!? You never
saw The Second Awaleening of
Christa Klages, and you call
yourself a filmmaker!?” No doubt,
the swirling waters of pretension
can run pretty high when it comes
to the “art thing.”

Jarmusch’s latest cinematic
expression is called Night
On Earth, and basically that’s
just what it is. We are shown a
series of five shorts, all taking
place in major cities‘ of the
world. L.A., New York, Rome,
Paris and Helsinki get the nod.
The action in each segment, for
the most part, takes place in a
taxicab.

Also similar are the
interchanges between players. In
the Los Angeles scene, we get a
give and take between a bawdy
cabette (Winona Ryder) and a
slick casting agent (Gena
Rowlands). In New York, we
draw a colloquialism—spouting
brother (Giancarlo Esposito) up
against an immigrant clown
(Armin Mueller—Stahl) from East
Germany.

Paris features a bald cabbie
from the Ivory Coast (Isaach De
Bankole) and a blind passenger
(Beatrice Dalle) who lives on the
canal. Rome matches a priest
(Paolo Bonacelli) with a rather,
illustrative individual (Roberto
Benigni), while Helsinki rounds
out the whole evening. In each
instance we get a clash, a harsh
juxtaposition of sorts that carries
the drama and provides for more

than a few yuks.

Once again, Jarmusch proves
himself to be one of the most
refreshing and innovative young
directors-of the day. His style

continues to evolve along the

line with past accomplishments
(Down By Law, Stranger Than
Paradise).

Editing is left at a bare
minimum. Shots tend to hold on
subjects just a bit longer than
usual.Everything takes on a slow,
methodical pace. I left the theater
buzzed, almost lulled physio-
logically by the sculpted and
mellow progression.

jarmusch likes to explore. It’s
as simple as that. He examines
the little things, the snippets, the
conglomeration of nuances that
make up character and reality.
The latter is what he strives for
and achieves.

As with the driving "scene in

the final segment of Mystery

Train, we get the sense that this
stuff is really happening. People
just sit and do nothing; motions
and activity take place without
the trappings ofdialogue, a look,
a gesture, a posture. It seems so
basic, but in fact it’s almost
obscure.

Jarmusch is cognizant of time,
and he plays with it. Unlike so
many of today’s directors, he
actually seems to be recording
something that is directly parallel
to experience. To a virgin
jarmuschian this can be quite
astonishing. «

No doubt, this style has a
tendency to stray from the
narrative at hand. One of the
reasons Jarmusch falls by the
wayside is his lack of tightness,
but it really doesn’t matter. Like
the film itself, the actual shorts
are a series of shorts. The vignettes
within the vignettes (if you may)
are so absorbing that they carries
the film. His eye for detail and ear
for dialogue are so strong that

Robert Benigni confesses to a priest inNight On Earth, the latest from director, writer and producerjim

Jarmusch.

actual story in the traditional sense
becomes secondary.

Not ignoring the actors, from
top to bottom the performances
are superb. Ryder is perhaps the
most stiff, but Rowlands’ sparkling
rendition of an agent
extraordinaire pulls the scene
through. Mueller—Stahl is
downright charming. Most
notable though is Italian comic
Benigni, whose oration about
soft pumpkins and sheep (go
figure) approaches legendary
proportions.

You may ‘wonder after
watching Night On Earth or any
of his other “classics,” why
Jarmusch gets so little national
play. Is it the taxi thing, a city
centrism of sorts? Is it the first-
gear pacing, the lack of big-

name players? (Rosie Perez makes

V an appearance in "the New York

segment, but maybe that's
reacting.) Or is it the stigma, the
art thing, only for an elite few?

Someone once said art and
commercialism will never be
married.

I tend to disagree, but it’s still
a real enigma as to how certain
trends are dictated and
categorized. Is it really the “give
the people what they want”
excuse thing? Or is it just some

I group of $1,200-wearing Hugo

Bosses deciding with a swipe of
their gold—laden hands which
films get the wide release and
which get the circuit? Why should
Pittsburghers have to wait months
to see the Orion Classics and
Fine Line releases (the latter being

jarmusch’s warehouse)?

The country is no longer the
sliced white—bread basket it once
was, more a messy, mosaic than

anything, making it difficult to '

argue any place as the be—all,
end-all of typicality. Even a
stylized hipster like Jarmusch
would like to have his picture

playing on 1,400 screens rather O

than 40. _
It’s like Jerry Garcia said after
the Grateful Dead’s LP In The
Dar/e went platinum: “Shit, we’ve
been waiting 20 years for this.” If
permitted, the cream will rise,
and that isn’t necessarily a sellout.
And hey, we’ll always have
Margarethe von Trotta.

Royally Trucked:The essence of the Blues

Royal Trux: "The Premier blues band of the decade." Depending on which hue you see.

By MC Lingo
Staﬂ" Writer

If you’re like me, then you missed the Stones at Altamont, right?
And your knowledge of, uh, a live Yardbirds set originates with the
Jeff Beck—guitar-smashin’ scene in Blow Up (where the band choogles
on with a lo-fi freakout version of “Train Kept A-Rollin”)? Well,
Scatman Crothers may well be dead and gone but, uh, is the blues
alive? Yep-yep-yippee. You betcha.

With the demise of a1l—star bush—league rock sputnik Pussy Galore,
good things were left in the wake — one being naked pictures of

some Julia Roberts clone on Boss Hogg records —— but more’

importantly guitar hero Neil Haggerty starting the premier blues band

of the decade in Royal Trux.

Started in the late ’80s as a four-piece, less—than-cohesive blues
fractal, Royal Trux disintegrated into Mr. Haggerty and womanfriend
Jennifer Herrema. They traveled the country,’ soaking up drugs and
oozing out great blues classics like “Sanction Smith” from their

obscure first LP.

Their sound is a collage/mess of outta-tune guitar, Moog humpin’
and fake theme songs to drug-induced_TV shows that never made it
to prime time or even production. Their second record, Twin Inﬁnitiz/es,
is a blues record about “biological entrapment.” It’s a completely yin-
yang sort of circumstance, where elements of melody and theme
become very monumental in comparison to lo-fl blues sputterings.
T rux use outdated early ’70s technology to yank space age rawk from
Moogs, Roland space echoes, etc., and this is pretty OK.

Live, the Royal T rux are, by hearsay accounts, an improv blues
band of the finest sort: stripped down, sparse blooze filtered through

Cool   IX/or

By Jason Hillman
Managing Editor

And you thought Betty Rubble
was hot.

Cool World, a new animation/
live—action combination by Ralph
Bakshi, creator of the X-rated
cartoon Fritz tbe Cat, at least has
enough well-drawn, ’top—heavy
‘toons to make the average
Neanderthal who has a thing for
one—dimensional characters drool
in anticipation.

. There has been only one other
modern attempt to interpose
animation and live action (W/90
Framed Roger Rabbit?’), so
comparisons were inevitable. And
because this movie was not made
by Disney (the undisputed lord
of animation, I believe), there
was reason to believe that Cool
ll’/orldwould probably not match
up.

It didn’t.

Cool Worlds plot, such as it
was, centered on the existence of
Cool World, an animated parallel
dimension which is only slightly
connected to the real world, such
as it is.

Jack Deebs (Gabriel Byrne) is
a cartoonist who drew a comic
book called, by all coincidences,
“Cool World."

The characters in the comic
exist in Cool -World, so naturally
Deebs assumes that he created
this alternate reality. Where he
goes wrong is in thinking that
anything in this movie makes

ld awful in two or three diinensions

sense.

Apparently this alternate
universe had existed at least since
1942, when Frank Harris (Brad
Pitt) crossed over to Cool World.
In the 50 years since, he has
become a Cool World police
officer and has not aged a single
minute.

Deebs is especially interested
in Holli Wood (Kim Basinger), a
doodle, as the animated chara-
cters are called. Wood is an
absurdly drawn caricature of a
woman that Deebs lusts after.
Harris tries to prevent Deebs and
Wood from “doing it,” a cardinal
sin in Cool World.

It probably goes withoutsaying
that the animation and the
interaction between animation
and live action doesn’t match the
stuff in Roger Rabbit.

Paramount probably did not
have the patience or the
inclination to put the kind of
effort into Cool World that Disney
put into Roger Rabbit.

But what kills this movie is the
fact that it just doesn’t make sense.
No thought runs through the
movie straight enough to be called
a plot line.

And what are the rules?

First doodles are banging off 6

the walls, then they can walk
through walls. Deebs gets pulled
back and forth from Cool World
involuntarily, then suddenly he
can will himself from one to the
other. These inconsistencies are
small on their own, but they

By Brian Gallagher
Senior Staﬂ“ Writer

For the Panther women's swim
team and head coach David
Belowich, the 1992-93 season is a
new beginning  sort of.

Last season, Pitt’s 10-year

stranglehold on the Big East’

championship came to a
screeching halt. Team injuries and
improved competition — in the
form of Villanova and Miami —
saw to that. But for the 12th—year
coach, the road back up to the
top is not paved by the
achievements of the past but the
hopes of the future.

That hope is deﬁned by Pitt’s
talented pool of new recruits.

“Always in terms of recruiting,
you always want to try to replace
your senior class that graduated,”
Belowich said, speaking of the
departing quintet ofJanine Atiyeh,
Noelle Barry, Crit Gallagher,
Mindy Hennon and Laura—Lee
Sullivan. “We’re talking about ﬁve
quality individuals.

“I really feel very confident
about this year’s freshman class;
very similar to what I told you
about a year ago.”

At that time — October of ’91'to
be exact— Belowich raved about
his new recruits, going so far as to
collectively call them “a
tremendous class.” The ensuing
season proved'his prophesy
correct. At the Big East conference

meet in February, first—year
athletes ﬂourished, with Vicki
Geubtner, Christy Knobloch,
Laura Zdyb, Kara Sixbury and
Anne Marie Rose providing
valuable points to a Panther third-
place finish. Belowich said he
hopes the 92-93 season will be
more of the same.

In all, Pitt signed six recruits for
the 1992-93 season. Topping the
list of Panther newcomers are
Chantel Glover, a breaststroke
specialist and citizen of Canada,

and Jill Fletcher, a 6-foot-2-inch

freestyle sprinter from suburban
Buffalo, N.Y.
Glover was a junior national

‘qualifier at Boston’s Lexington

High School in the 100- and 200-
yard breaststroke. Along with
returning distance specialist Zdyb,
she is a member of the renowned
Bernal Gators swim club. Fletcher,
a junior national qualifier at East
Aurora (South Wales, NY) High
School in the 100 and 200
breaststroke, has only swum for
four years.

Belowich mentioned Fletcher’s
size (6-2) and success, despite
inexperience, as reasons to be
excited about the lanky upstate

S New Yorker.

“She brings a lot of potential,”
Belowich said. “And along with
Chantel, [she] will be looked upon
to fill some big shoes.”

expects the Pitt rookies to fill are

New recruit Sam Crowley, a shortstop from outside

said. “We recruit thebest players available, not necessarily [for

Following his recruiting philosophy of taking the best player
available, Jackson signed Crowley, whom he considers one of
the best players in the Philadelphia region. He was the MVP of

outstanding athlete who also played quarterback at Upper

Winning a baseball division title
is perhaps the most difficult
endeavor in team sports. A
grueling 162—game schedule to
decide only four playoff spots
completely dwarfs the smaller
seasons and bloated playoff
structure of America’s other major
sports. ‘

At the All—Star break, the Pirates
hold a tenuous 4 1/2 game lead
over the St. Louis Cardinals in
baseball's weakest division. And
with sports’ toughest test of team
endurance half over, it is an
excellent opportunity to give the
Pirates their midterm grades.
First Base:

Leyland’s platoon tactics have
worked beautifully in the outfield
and behind the plate. They do
not work here. The merry-go-
round of Orlando Merced, John
Wehner, Gary Redus and Jeff
King has been a broken record of
disappointment, disability and
disaster. Their combined efforts
produced a meager .210 average.
Leyland should just play the
switch—hitting Merced every day
and cut his losses. GRADE: D+.
Second Base:

Jose Lind was born to play
brilliant second base, bat eighth
and hit .260. Two out of three will
suffice. Through 88 games in ’92,
Chico is having his best year
defensively, turning the double
play withJay Bell like no duo out
there. But at the plate, Lind is

nationals in the 50-yard freestyle
this spring. She is the first
swimmer ever from PDR to be
recruited by Pitt.

The signing of Tymes is Pitt’s
gain, according to her PDR coach
Jim Ellis, who calls the recruiting
of his prized pupil “a bargain.”

“Alicia has a tremendous feel
for the water," Ellis said from his

stumbling at a .233 clip. While
always a better second-half hitter,
his first—half production is nothing
to do flips over. GRADE: B.
Shortstop:

Before thinking about what Bell
hasn’t done this year, recall these
names — Rey Quinones, Sammy
Khalifa, Bill Almon and Rafael
Belliard. Remember when the
Pirates couldn't find a shortstop
to save their lives? Seems like a
thousand 0-for-4 nights ago. Since
1990, Jaybird »has been Mr.
Reliable for Leyland and the Bucs,
and ’92 is more of the same.
Three full seasons with Bell as
number—two hitter and at short
should equal three division titles.
GRADE: B.

Third Base:

When the Bucs had Buechele,
they had one of the best gloves
on the corner, but he was an
overrated offensive player (only
a .241 lifetime average). The bad
news is that his replacements
(King and Wehner) will be even
worse. Now the Pirates rotate
mediocrity at both corners.
Midterm GRADE: B- but slipping
fast.

Catcher:

This is one platoon that works.
Mike LaValliere and Don Slaught
combine to hit .307 and drive in
27 runs and can both catch great
games. Not exactly all-star
numbers butstill better than most.
GRADE: B. ’ i ’
Left Field:

Mr. Big Mouth Barry Bonds
may not be Mr. Pittsburgh,,but he
is Mr. Left Field. He’s the team

Philadelphia office. “And I think
she has a lot of raw talent.
"With a concentrated strength
program, which she;.hasn’t had in
her previous training, she's really
gonna fly.”  _

own in a new environment —

Bucs recieve good midterm grddes

leader in RBIs, HRs, stolen bases
—— you name it. Simply stated,
Barry Bonds is the best player in
baseball, so enjoy him while he’s
here. GRADE: A+.

Center Field:

Mr. Pittsburgh number three,
behind Mr. Rogers and Mr.
Hockey of course, all-star Andy
Van Slyke is proving that his
great 1988 season was no fluke.
With a .340 average, “Slick” is a
legitimate threat to win the Bucs’
first batting title since Bill Madlock
in 1983, as long as his back holds
out. As for his defensive
capabilities, nobody does it better.
GRADE: A+.

Right Field:

Another platoon tactic that is

hurting the Buccos. The Kirk

Gibson trial was a total failure. -

Merced, Redus, Gary Varsho and
Cecil Espy gave the position
nothing more than a consistent
warm body next to Van Slyke. If
spark plug Alex Cole (.333
average so far) gets a chance to
play every day, this C— will change
to an A—. But in Leyland’s system,
don’t count on it. GRADE: C-.
Starting Pitcher:

_ While their win-loss records
don’t reflect it, Zane Smith (3.03
ERA) and Doug Drabek (140
innings, 2.95 ERA) have been
studs for pitching coach Ray Miller
this year. Both are guaranteed
seven—plus inning guys every fifth
day. When both faltered, Randy
Tomlin (10-5) kept the Bucco
cruiser aﬂoat by winning six in a
row. Number-four and -five

There are many things you will

never see Charles Barkley carrying
Christian Laettner’s baggage in

Then again, who would have
thought the Red Sox would be
leading the American League in
pitching and still be way out of

Predictions are a shaky

business. There is some stability V

in the world. Despite some great
young talent, the Cleveland
Indians still play in an ugly old
stadium and they still don’t win
much, so maybe there can be
valid predictions in baseball.

NLEast

Speaking of the Indians, the
whole National League East looks
like the star-crossed residents of
the “mistake by the lake.” The
Pirates have gone through some
stretches in which they looked
terrible this season, but they are
still on top.

Doug Drabek, Zane Smith and
Randy Tomlin are the only set
starters, and the bullpen is a
mess. Barry Bonds is back, but
he can’t do it alone. The recent
trade of Steve Beuchele to

.Chicago for brittle left—handed

starter Danny Jackson puts even
more of the burden on Bonds.
Acquiring speedster Alex Cole to
bat leadoff might help, but the
offense is no juggernaut. This
would all be so much easier with
John Smiley, who is currently
having a strong year for
Minnesota.

may be the best in the business.
The inﬁeld hasn’t lived up to
expectations and two solid
starters, Bob Tewksbury and
Donovan Osborne, aren’t enough
to win even this division.

The Cubs are another team
with two pitchers,,(Mike Morgan
and Greg Maddux) carrying the
starting rotation. That isn’t
enough with no established
closer in the bullpen and a lineup
with holes at shortstop, and two-

thirds of the outfield.

The Mets are a mess. The
defense continues to lose games
for them, and the offense isn’t
getting it done either. The pitching
is looking very thin with Bret
Saberhagen on the disabled list.
John Franco is still the only
dependable reliever, and he has
a sore elbow. If Bobby Bonilla

and Howard Johnson don’t start
crushing the ball soon, forget it.
NLWest_

Out west two teams are taking
charge. The Cincinnati Reds are
on top, with the Atlanta Braves
closing in. Both seem likely to
crush any NL East team in the
post-season.

The Reds are solid everywhere.
Whether or not shortstop Barry
Larkin and pitcher Rob Dibble
come back from tough first halves,
it could very well be a Red
October in the National League.

The Braves are still around
because of a strong starting
rotation, but they need bullpen
help and’ a return to form by
David Justice to stay with the
Reds. Some production from an
infielder other than Terry
Pendleton would help. I

San Diego is the best of the
rest. They can score runs with
anyone, but the pitching just isn’t
there, especially with staff ace
Bruce I-lurst on the trading block.

Down at the bottom are the
over-rated Dodgers. Good luck
finding one guy on this roster
living up to expectations.
ALEAST

The Toronto Blue Jays are
another team with too many guys
not living up to expectations, but
they keep on winning. Kelly
Gruber (.251 average), Dave Stjeb
(5.35 ERA) and Todd Stottlemyre
(5.52) are key guys who are not
producing. Juan Guzman
continues to dominate, as does
the bullpen, and Jack Morris
keeps finding ways to win. All-
Stars Roberto Alomar and Joe
Carter have been outstanding as
usual. Veteran Dave Winﬁeld
(.505, 14 HR, 47 RBI)ihas been
the key, making quite a few
general managers look very
stupid. 2

The Baltimore Orioles have
emerged from a pack of
pretenders to challenge the Jays
for the top spot. Youngster Mike
Mussina has stepped up big as
the main man in an erratic
rotation. Despite recent problems
and a goofy-looking beard, Gregg
Olson is a top—notch closer. All-
Star Brady Anderson and catcher
Chris Hoiles (.280, 14 HR) have
come up with big seasons to key
a solid lineup. They could
challenge all year ifthey can hold
on until Hoiles returns from a
wrist injury.

In recent years Milwaukee has
been home to a bad Brew Crew
made up of injury-prone stars
and bad attitudes. New manager
Phil Garner seems tofhave found
a better mix and has the Brewers
running a strong third in the
division. Paul Molitor is quietly
having a monster year (.522 avg,
10 HR, /l3fl{Bl, I5 SB). Third
baseman Kevin Seltzer has
rediscovered his stroke, and
Dante Bichette continues to

develop in right field. Still, it has i

been rookie shortstop Pat Listach
(.295, 29 SB) who has stirred this
batch into one ofthe most potent
offenses in the league. If the
slapped—together pitching staff
can hold up, Milwaukee could
make a run.

will also be beneﬁcial for
Tymes. The smaller “big—
city” atmosphere is the key.

“Pittsburgh will be an
ideal setting for ITymesI.
It’s not overpowering, but
yet it’s not a remote, small
town. It will let her grow
and find out who she is,”
Ellis said.

The fourth Pitt newcomer
is Susan Poorbaugh, a
middle-distance freestyle
specialist from Lancaster,
Pa. Also a junior national
participant, Poorbaugh
swam her senior season
exclusively at the Lancaster
Aquatics Club under the
guidance of Bob Herlinger.

Herlinger called
Poorbaugh “a terrific
person” who sometimes
suffers from “a lack of
confidence.” He said that
once she improves her
mental approach, “she’ll just
swim off her talent.

“I really hope and feel
that she’ll be a much better
swimmer
I-Ierlinger said. “She
sometimes thinks too much.
A lot of her talent has yet to
be tapped, but she’s a
dedicated, hard worker, one
who is really gonna help
Pill.”

Another Pennsylvania
native setto help Pitt is

Chrissy DiLeonardo from,

Philadelphia Neshaminy
High School. A breaststroke
and sprint—freestyle event
swimmer, DiLeonardo is
currently training for the
junior Olympics. According
to her club coach, Energy
Swimming’sJeff Emore, Pitt
is getting a solid athlete —
in and out of the water.

“I think she’ll do really
well at Pitt in class and in
competition,” Emore, a 1985
Panther graduate, said.
“She’s been training all
summer and should be in
fine condition by August.”
— Rounding out the
swimming class is Jenny
Doran, a butterfly and
distance freestyler from
Bakeland, Fla.

While the swimmers need
an injection of youth to
replace departing seniors,
the Pitt women’s diving
team has the luxury of
adding talented recruits to
a lineup that loses no one.

Along with returning

every diver from last year’s
team, coach Julian Krug
welcomes three new
recruits to the Trees Pool
deck: Mount Lebanon
graduate Sunday
Lewandowski, Amy
Spinnenweber ofCarlynton
High School and Cherry
Hill, N.j., native Diane
Maiese.
. With returning stars in
Donna Flatch, Anne Marie
Rose and Kara Sixbury, Pitt’s
women’s diving should be
as strong as ever.

“Along with who we
return, I expect our divers
to do quite well,” Krug said.

Minnesota Twins have reaped
the benefits of some Pirate
charity by getting John Smiley
without giving up any key
players. A starting rotation
anchored by Smiley, Kevin
Tapani and Bill Krueger has
taken Minnesota back to the
top of the division. ,Kirby
Puckett’s contract drive has
gotten the attention, while Kent
Hrbek, Brian Harper, Chuck
Knobloch and Shane Mack
quietly roll along to the top.

Now if they could just get the
Oakland A’s to play Cleveland
more often... Until a recent

ambush by the Tribe, the bash
brothers were back on top of the
West. Mark McGwire has
rediscovered his home-run stroke;
infielder Mike Bordick keeps on
hitting over .300, and Dennis
Eckersley is still the best closer
on the planet. Other than that it
has been a great juggling act by
Tony La Russa that has kept the
A’s in contention. That won’t be
enough over the long haul.
Texas is very much in range of
the top but just can’t put it all
together. It has assembled a
decent starting rotation with the
resurgence of Kevin Brown, but
the defense is a mess and the

offense isn’t as imposing as
expected with Julio Franco and
Rafael Palmiero struggling. Finally
unloading manager Bobby
Valentine might help.

The White Sox are also missing
something. Frank Thomas and
Robin Ventura can’t carry a
mediocre pitching staff on their
own. Tim Raines is no longer‘ a
premier player. Ozzie Guillen is
out for the year. Steve Sax and
George Bell must recover from
weak first halves for the White
Sox to fulfill their promise.
Predictions:

Jim LeyIand’s magic and an
MVP year from Bonds will be

SHTURDEY

enough to get the Pirates into the
playoffs again. just like 1990,
Cincinnati will sink the Bucs in
their hunt for Red October and
roll on to the World Series.

In the American League, the
Twins and Blue Jays will square
off for the second year in a row.
Last year, jack Morris carried the
Twins to a World Series
championship. This year he will
do the same for Toronto, as
immense talent overcomes
mediocre managing andthe Blue
jays finally win a world

“There is no intent to transfer anybody anywhere,” O’Connor said.

Some staff members persisted in their skepticism. “There is an
overwhelming concern, speciﬁcally among the staff of the medical
school. Rumor mill has it that the School of Medicine staff will
become Presby employees,” SAC president Joanne Rosol said.

Masnick assured the staff that such rumors were unfounded, and
O’Connor concurred. ‘‘I know of no plan for any other transfer
activities to the Presby corporate sector from our‘ health sciences,”
O’Connor said.

Many staffers felt that the transfer system, through which Pitt
employees can request transfers to other areas, simply does not
work. In one employee’s words, incompetent supervisors are often
simply transferred to other areas, leaving the staff to fend for itself.
In addition, the employee complained that the mechanisms of
affirmative action do not work, saying that once an investigation is
completed, resulting changes only beneﬁt those in management.
I-ler remarks earned a round of applause from the assembly.

“We need to evaluate and improve the transfer system,” O’Connor
said. “l would rather change the environment than transfer a person
out. We need to change attitudes.We really have to begin to treat
each other as we want to be treated  we have to develop honest
evaluations, and where there are difﬁculties, help these individual.,”

Other issues brought up at the meeting included health care plans,
maternity leave, supervisory evaluations and early retirement, which
O’Connor and Wilds said are currently being re—evaluated.

On health care, O’Connor said, ‘‘I can tell you we have instructed
ITuchiI and [the senior vice chancellor for health administration
Jeffrey Romoffl to go out and look at various fringe benefits and their
costs.” J

Though Pitt does have a maternity leave without pay, Wilds said
the university has been looking into a new maternity/family leave
policy for years.

O’Connor also said he understood concerns about who will

conduct evaluations of supervisors. “lfl worked for a jerk, I’d like J

to be able to say that to somebody,” he said.

One staffer asked O’Connor about Pitt’s retirement plan and
suggested that the university adopt a system that takes into account
both age and years ofservice.O’Connor sounded enthusiastic about
the idea. ‘‘I’d like to apply," he responded with a chuckle.

Wilds said that an early retirement proposal had been done earlier
and had been decided against but that the proposal could be
explored again.The forum was deemed a success by Rosol and other
members of the SAC.

“IO’Connorl is unique in encouraging open communication. He
has encouraged the commitment for open communication,” Rosol
said.

positions have been shuffled
between Bob Walk, who did his
annual groin pull, a former
reliever (Jeff Robinson), an
inconsistent young arm (Denny
Neagle) and a wild Russian (Victor
Cole). Newest Pirate Danny
Jackson can’t hurt as number-
four starter. GRADE: C+.

Relief Pitcher:

Stan “Boom Boom” Belinda is
among the league leaders out of
the pen (15 saves, 2.41 ERA), but
he has yet to earn true stopper
status in this rag—tag bullpen, and
for good reason. He is too
inconsistent to earn l.eyland’s
trust. Lefty Bob Patterson has’
done a great job in middle relief
and in spotty closer roles, while
Roger Mason has been hot and
cold. Sum—of—parts theory applies
in spades, but maybe this is the
year the other shoe finally drops
on this shaky bullpen by
committee. GRADE: C+.
Coaching Staff:

WithoutJim Leyland, the Pirates
would be as bad as the Mets. He
has the ability to block out

distractions and to get the most

out ofwhat the Bucco brass gives
(and takes from) him. He’s the
NL’s best. I-le wins becausehe
has done what so few modem
managers have done —— he’s
surrounded himself with a top-
notch coaching staff. His only
glaring flaw is his obsession with
the platoon. Alex Cole’s leading
off and playing right field every
day would lock up the division
for the Pirates. GRADE; —A.
Bench:

Leyland’s lackeys are a group
of overachieving, under-
appreciated Buccos. Reliable Gary
Varsho and Cecil Espy (.270
average) have provided timely
hitting as well as above~average
defense in the outfield. Lloyd
McC1end_on (115, 313, LF, C) and
Jeff King (all four infield spots)
give the bench some much-
needed versatility and occasional
pinch—hit punch. Overexposure
hurts their effectiveness. They’re
best if used on an interval basis
— meaning with a healthy starting
lineup. GRADE: B.

team is pitcher Dennis Terzich
(1-1, 6.04 ERA in 14 games).
Otherwise, next season’s team
will remain about the same.
Among those returning will be
starting pitcher Bill Junker (6-3,
4.21 ERA in 10 games), who had
an impressive season with the
Panthers in his nine starts. Jackson
said he hopesJunker can have an
equally good season next_year.
“If he stays healthy and can work
on an off-speed pitch, he can be
even better. He doesn’t have any
pressure on him because we have
other experienced pitchers.”
Although’ Pitt's pitching
improved last season, Jackson
hopes to add some more pitchers
as recruits. “We will recruit
pitchers with experience. The
pitching has improved, but we
need it to improve more.” In all,
Jackson said he hopes to add
four to five more recruits in the
next few weeks. ~
