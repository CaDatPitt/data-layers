Snow Blankets Oakland Area;
University Activity a Standstill

By PAT POLLINO

Winter unloosed its fury Sunday, dumping more
than a foot of snow on the Oakland community and
necessitating the cancellation Monday and.Tuesday
of University classes and most major events.

Area radio stations boomed out the message
early Monday morning that University classes were
to be cancelled. A number of students, mostly
commuters, showed up for morning classes in spite
of thevcancellation announcement, only to be re-
buffed by the virtual standstill of University
activity. . - ’

Resident students on the whole resigned them-
selves to the ‘dorms, a few venturing only as far as
the University mail center. Some welcomed the
change in weather, if only to cavort in the snow.

Contrary to the usual parades of students carry-
ing books, attache cases and the like, pedestrians
instead carried snow shovels and trudged along 0
foot-high, snow-covered sidewalks. '

Automobiles parked on Oakland streets were
blanketed by the two-day snowstorm. Several
students parlayed their acrobatic talents to rid
snow-covered vehicles of all-encompassing snow
screens.

Trallic ﬂow on Oakland streets was low Mon-

establishments. Many stores were closed as a re-_

day, as wascommercial. traffic in Oakland business

sult of the storm. V

Also closed for the day’s activity were a number
of University ofﬁces. ._

The University Book Center and libraries
were made available to students despite the in-
clement weather. Towers Cafeteria and Hunt
Room were in operation, whereas Schenley Cafe-
teria, Venetian Room and Tuck Shop w_ere in-
active. _

The absence ofoa number of regular employees
in the Towers Cafeteria resulted in the recruitment
of a number of dorm students whose part-time
work schedule does not normally include Monday.

Student Union Forum Series was cancelled.» It
has not been determined whether the forum, “‘Con-
servatism and Freedom,” will be rescheduled.

V A Monday evening program commemmorating
the centennial of Stephen Collins Foster was pre-
sented as scheduled, but without guest speaker

and Jay Willoughby, actor. V

Chancellor Selected
‘63 ‘Man of the Year’ G

Chancellor Litchﬁeld has still another honor to add to
his long list of achievements. The Junior Chamber of Com-
merce of Pittsburgh has named" him as its “Man of the Year
for 19633’ J ’ V 0

‘Chancellor Litchﬁeld’s selection was based on his “out-.
standjin-g academic guidance and leadership” since becoming
chancellor of the Univeisity in July, 1955. . 5

A banquet in honor of the Chancellor and 15 other.

award winners in Various categories will takevplace Jan. 27 at '

the “Man of the Year” banquet 

.. Some Accomplishments

Some of this year’s accomplish-
ments for which the Chancellor
was especially cited included the
space center, the Panther Hollow

Last January, he announced
that the University‘- would build
a space center in Oakland with
the aid \of a federal grant of ‘
$1,300,000. Then in June, he
announced that -the _Oakland

‘Corporation plans to build a
250 million-dollar research park .
in Panther Hollow.

The chancellor told Coach John’
Michelosen that he expected a
more daring football team in
1963. The team had a 9-1 record,
its most successful season since
1938.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld_ '
Named ‘Man of Year’ .
Also included in his 1963 accomplishments was the opening -of
three new regioﬁ/al campuses last September. ' J
Chancellor Litchﬁeld believes that the death of the University ,
as a city college has been a good thing. “When students come in here i
from California or Connecticut, we aren’t doing them a favor," he 7 '

said. “We're making it possible

Dr. Douglas Thompson, Director of the Student Health Service,
said about the recently released report on cigarette smoking: “It's
meaningful that scientists of this caliber have reinforced the views
expressed by other eminent scientists over the past ten years.

“This report has more meaning than the several individual re-
ports issued previous to it, because this report was made by a com-
mittee of eminent scientists, backed by extensive research.”

He also said that he doesn't think the report will radically
change the habits of people already addicted to smoking, “but it

.4 should greatly inﬂuence people who are thinking about starting.”

The report, which was the result of a fourteen-month evaluation
at 8,000 separate studies, said: . "

contributes substantially to mortality from
and to the over-all death rate.” '

The report, several hundred pages long, termed cigarette smok-
ing a signiﬁcant cause of lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, and cancer
of the larynx.

Smoking, it said, is also related to other diseases -— cancer of
the esophagus, cancer of the urinary bladder, peptic ulcer, amblyopia
(dimness of vision), and cirrhosis of the liver — but no deﬁnite cause-
and-effect relationship has been established for these diseases.

It also said: “In comparison with nonsmokers, average male
smokers of cigarettes have approximately a 9-to-10-fold risk of
developing lung cancer and heavy smokers at least a 20-fold risk.”

Lecture-Film Series

To Open Next Monday

Alpha Epsilon Delta, an international pre—medical honor
society, will present the ﬁrst program on its lecture-ﬁlm
series “Advances in Medicine” next Monday at noon in L9
CH. Dr. Albert L. Amshel, chief attending proctologist at
Monteﬁore Hospital, will talk on “Advances in Proctology.”

The series, nicknamed AIM, will consist of ﬁve such pro-

grams which will feature eminent¢

medical specialists from various
local hospitals. The programs will
be relatively non,-technical and
will be open to the entire Uni-
versity. AED has given each lec-
turer a free hand so that each pro-
gram will be different.

Dr. William B. Kiesewetter,
surgeon-in-chief at Children’s

.Hospital, will narrate the original

ﬁlms taken there during the sepa-

ration of Siamese twins last June
17 at the second program Feb. 3.
' ‘Caesarean Section

The Parke, Davis & Co.’s color
ﬁlm “Caesarean Section” will be
the feature of the third program
which will be held Feb. 17. Dr.
Henry Erving, chief of obstetrics
and gynecology at Western Penn-
sylvania Hospital, will narrate it
and will also discuss general ad-
vances in obstetrics. '

Dr. Frederick Amshel, chief
attending dermatologist at Alle-
gheny General Hospital, will
use color slides to illustrate his
lecture on diseases of the skin
March 2.

Following the showing of Parke,
Davis & Co.’s color ﬁlm “Cardiac
Catheterization” at the last pro-
gram March 16, Dr. Donald
Fischer, chief attending cardiolo-
gist at Allegheny General_Hospita1,
will comment on this relatively
new procedure for handling con-
genital heart disease. He will also
discuss modern methods of heart
surgery.

All Authorities

‘When asked about AIM, Norman
Edelstein, AED Historian and AIM
chairman, said, “We were very
fortunate in receiving such re-
markable co-operation from the
ﬁve physicians who will lecture
for us.” He said that each man is

in his specialty.
AED emphasizes that AIM is

designed for both premeds and
non-premeds and will be con-
tinued next year only if sulﬁ-
cient support is offered this
term, Edelstein said. He added,
“We feel that this series is the
hottest program to hit our cam-
pus in a. long time and we hope
that the student body will take
advantage of the lectures.”

Edelson ended, “The average
student at Pitt may never in his
lifetime have another opportunity
to see the general techniques and
surgicalpperations that will be
presented.”

WPDU Has Busy Weekend;
Garners Third at Illinois State

William Pitt Debating Union had

one of its busiest weekends last
week. It was highlighted by a
third place in the Championship
Division at Illinois State Univer-
sity, a ﬁrst place ﬁnish at the
Duquesne Freshman Tournament,
and a Best.Spe'aker Award at the
Akron, Ohio Freshman Tourna-
ment.

As stated by Dr. Robert P. New-
man, director of WPDU, they had
two Championship Division Teams
competing at Illinois State. The

.ﬁrst team of James Joseph, and

Martin Engels, was the only un-
defeated team with a 6-0 record
in the preliminary rounds. They
defeated Purdue in the quarter-—
ﬁnals. In the semiﬁnals, however,
they lost to Wayne State and plac-
ed third overall. The
Championship Team of Tom
Zaucher and Gerald Dzura had a
2-4 record
rounds.

Two varsity division debate
teams also competedat Illinois
State. . Although they won no
prizes, the. team __of Carolyn

' Szolis and Carol Durant had a

record of ﬁve wins ‘and one
loss. The other varsity team of
Ted; Danielson and Jim Moyer
had a 2-4 record. '

At the Duquesne Freshman
Tournament, the two teams’ over-
all record of ﬁve victories and one
loss gave them a ﬁrst "place vic-
tory. The team of Don Leet and
Joseph Bednar had a perfect 3-0
record, while the -team of Alan

Eﬁtorian   Man «Of The Year’

Last week Chancellor Litchﬁeld was named 1963 “Man of the Year”
by the Pittsburzgh Junior Chamber of Commerce, and his list of credits
’ is enough to win him the title of “Man of the Decade” —— at least as far as

 

1 the city of Pittsburgh and this University are concerned.

_- Since coming here in 1955, Dr. Litchﬁeld has built this institution
into a respectable university with more buildings, professors, students,
and expenses than anyone had previously thought possible. And if the
Chancellor is to be believed, and if the money is forthcoming, the future ..

_ ‘holds even more wonders than those he has been able to pull out of his

 hat in the past. V , ’

’ The trend of thinking this past year has ‘gone straight into the air.

The University is now in the midst of plans for the erection of a
multi—million dollar space research center; the Oakland Corporation, of

which Dr". Litchﬁeld is chairman, is well on the way toward building a
quarter-billion dollar research part in the air above the tracks‘ in Panther

‘Hollow; and tuition has recently climbed to a new height.

But all these things, even the rise in tuition, are merely mani-
festation of the principle of growth which has dominated the thinking
concerning this institution since.Dr. Litchﬁeld ﬁrst assumed his oﬁice.

The question which still remains unanswerednfor many of us is

. =;’A rMoh‘er of Mind .

 Student Education

Anthropologists tell us that
man is a rational animal. As

such it is only natural that men

‘have traits that are found in

the lower spe-
cies along the

ary c y c 1 e s .
Our intellect is '
the on e thing
that elevates us
from the depths’
in which other
animals w al— _
low. A univer- ’
sity is the place

 A where this intellect is supposed

to be nourished, and developed
so that it will have that keen
edge which makes us as human

beings superior. Yet a univer-

sity is the very place where pre-
cepts of developing our intel-
lect are often ﬂung to one side

' and the students treated as com-

mon animals.

We are not students to many
ofvthe faculty members but
mere, tape recording machines
or parrots who are given cer-

- tain set of facts and ‘opinions

and/then expected to relay the
information at the time of the
examination to the master who
knows it already because he
gave it to us in the first place.

The great minds in the ﬁeld

A ' , of education may well counter

that all we are taught in col-

_ lege is absorbed by our subcon-

scious and that what we con-
sider trivial at the moment will
be invaluable in our future un-
dertakings, that what we mem-
orize now will condition us to
cope with other similar prob-
lems, knowing how this one is
solved. They may even say that
college is the place where the
student must be exposed to ideas
of great, men of the past and
of present-day intellectuals hired
to dispense their knowledge to
us. ‘ '
This may all very well be true
but the fact remains that stu-
dents have 'a developing intel-

 

lect, and naturally think about

everything _they read and do.’

They also on occasion have con-
trary openion to those expressed
by an author or the expert who
reveals “the truth.” At such
time the student feels the need
and desire to express his
views and expects that they
will be properly weighed and
his right of expressionirespected.

Progress only comes about by
old ideas giving wayto newer
and more sophisticated ones,
and therevis certainly no guar-
antee that it will not be a stu-
dent who will come up with a
newer, better approach on the
subject under study. In any case,
the reaction that a statement or
a piece of writing produces‘
upon the students can not wait
years to be aired; they must be
revealed then or be bottled up
forever. Thus a very useful piece
of "criticism can easily be lost
by adherence to the present
principles of education.

In any case, a university is
said to bethe training ground
for developing and using of our
intellects. If it just acts as a
fact factory, then the goal stat-
ed is not achieved. If the stu-
dent is not given any chance to
exercise and bring into play his

‘intellect, then the university be-

comes of little or no use to the
student. He must go out into the
world still unprepared in the
use of his intellect and the facts
that the university makes avail-
able can as easily be obtained
by the student by simply pick-
ing up the book on his own time
and reading it. He may miss
live discourses on the subjects
he pursues in his spare time but
the deﬁciency can be made by
reading a critique by‘ a notable
person in the. ﬁeld. _
In most instances the. classes
are overcrowded especially in
Humanities, and the instructors
feel justiﬁed to announce that
due to the size of class it will
not be possible to entertain any
questions or comments from the

when is all of this growth going to stop and some plan announced for
the solidiﬁcation of the group already won. Admittedly there are many
areas in the University where much has been accomplished and many
improvements have been made, but where there is only the framework of
a good system and where much more effort is going to have to expended
before perfection is reached. This is the cast with the trimester itself, for
example, and‘ the distribution program for another. .

Yet we should not become impatient, because this University is
in the ‘middle of a reconstruction program the likes of which few colleges
have ever attempted. It_is an exciting programin that every student is

A Question of.C.|ass

Editor, The Pitt News:
Re: Bob $I.nizik’s column of
Dec. 9:

Where did Pitt suddenly ac-
quire all this class? Is this some-
thing new that comes with a
winning football team, which I
congratulate, or has it been
around for a long time? Where
was all that class last year at
-the ‘Pitt-West Virginia game?

The booing at that time was
loud and long, even though
there was no close decision to
get excited about. By the ad-

- mission of Bobby. Lewis and

Ben Jinks everything was called
as it happened, but still the
students with so much class‘ per-
sisted in booing the ‘West Vir-
ginia team and the referee. Pitt

-had some consolation though —

they had a chance to avenge
their loss; This chance they
won't offer Duquesne.

How much class do you need
to paint the Penn State lion

with PITT? I admit that there -

is not proof that this is the
work of a Pitt student, but I
also am fairly certain that
Penn State didn’t paint their
own stature. ' ' ’

Pitt’s good- taste was very

evident Saturday night during .

the time outs. The combo, so
thoughtfully provided by Pitt
and placed near the visiting
team’s student section, chose to
do their playing at the same

least.

ford their rival an opportunity
to cheer their own team.

- Of _course Pitt’s motive was
obvious; until last, year the stu-
dents at Pitt didn’t bother to
go to basketball games let alone
express any enthusiasm for the
team. The band’s playing would
hide the apathy of the Pitt stu-

~ dent body and at the same time

muffle the spirit of the Duquesne
group. I

All of this of course. does not
excuse the poor showing of cer-
tain ‘individuals at the game. I
particularly thought the booing
of opposing players and also
Harry Stuhldreher at the pres-
entation of trophies a show of
bad taste. But your concern for
the referees is somewhat more
than funny. Ever since specta-
tors have attended competitive
sports they’ve had the right to
disagree ’ with the ofﬁcials and
to voice this displeasure without
becoming vulgar. If you have
never booed an official then
maybe you -have the right to
condemn others, but I don’t be-
lieve you or any other specta-
tor at that game qualiﬁes.

As a spectator I don’t feel that
I can speak for the actions of
the team, its coach or any in-
dividual on the team. But I
noted the cries of protest_ which
sounded, when the MVP was
given to Willie Somerset. Some-

one obviously considered «Willie v

player. You said Duquesne could
do without him, yet when they
tried Pitt closed the gap to a
tie score. The pressure was of!
Pitt when he ﬁnally fouled out.
Your reasoning_ doesn’t make
sense to me.

Much of what happened Sat-
urday is very regrettable and

equally unexcusable. I do think".

it would be better in many ways
if the timekeeper was someone
other than a Pitt employer. Pos-
sibly one of the local high school
referees could be used. This
might save a few arguments.
Finally, Mr. Smizik, I have
now attended both Pitt and Du-
quesne and your assertion that
Pitt has more class inherently
is absurd. Not long ago Pitt was
a “commuter school” also. In
the past few years they have

_ advanced in size, scope, athletics,

and other areas. Be not mis-
taken though, cIass.doesn’t come
automatically w i t h expansion.
Noris it totally lost at one in-
stant. I. wait for the game in
which Pitt receives the wrong
end of a close call. But your
silly statg.-ments, if the Pitt stu-
dents decide to boo the referees

_ they will be lowering themselves

and taking your class with them.

Should Duquesne play Pitt
next year I will expect fo see
you and the student body of
Pitt applaude when Duquesne
accepts the trophy. Until then,

In The Spotlight

with Stan Schiveiger

‘~ One of the most lasting images in the entertainment
world has been the reputation of Walt Disney among the

world’s masses. Mr. Disney’s

past works conjure up the

image of a creator of cartoons and feature length, motion
pictures devoted to the perrenial child, theperson who re-
fuses to be bothered by the harshness and brutality of the
real, but who immerses himself in the animals, cartoons, and

'37 screwball characters that have made
 popular and tremendously rich.

Disney tremendously

“ Disney’s (latest creation entitled “The Sword in the

Stone,” is a very enjoyable

epic cartoon based on the.

legendary fables of King Arthur. Once more we return to
the glorious days of chivalry and the Middle "Ages to ﬁnd
an assortment‘ of characters that have taken their place in
the -hearts and spirits of anyone-who has ever read about
them. We see King Arthur, as a child, -dislodging the im-
mortal __sword, Excalibur, from the stone and thus proclaim-
/"“' 'ing his -true identity as the King of England.’ We see Merlin

the Magician, weaving various?-

spells over the inhabitants of the
imaginary’ kingdom of the Round
Table, and we see the deeds, the
suspenses, -and the wild adventures
of a long. ago ‘age that ‘holds a
peculiar but loveablev stronghold
on the imaginations of the -.public.
. The world of Disney is put to
work with care and intelligence
and it is apparent that a man like
Walt Disney knows what_the pub-
he wants and gives it to them in
his inimitable fashion. It is a

proud tradition in the history of‘

20th century American entertain-
ment, which began with a 10-
minute cartoon called “Steamboat
Willie,” and which has continued

uninterruptedly down to the very .

moment. Creations such as Mickey
“"" Mouse, “S t e a m b o a t Willie,”
:4 Donald Duck, Pluto, Goofy, Chip
“n” Dale, are now household tra-
ditions with children. And not to

.be denied, the creator from Bur-
bank, California, departed f1;om

the regular cartoon features 4 to

produce animated‘ works ‘on a

grander scale.

Disney’s devotion to children of
 all ages began with the- Three
~,.‘f Little Pigs who sang the theme

song of the depression, “Who’s
7 Afraid of the Big, Bad Wolf.” The
career then proceeded to such
fond remembrances as “Dumbo,”
“Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs,” “Pinocchio,” _“Cindar-
ella,” “Song of the South,” “Peter
Pan,” “Silly Symphonie,”_ and

many others. America went to the _

cartoons and came ‘away singing
A “When You Wish Upon a Star,”
S‘ rgand “Someday My Prince Will
Come.” These were faultless pro-
ductions _and whenever they are
revived they will command a great

and ‘loyal audience.
In the ﬁeld of nature ﬁlms and
in regular motion pictures such

as “The Absent-Minded Profes-
sor,” “Treasure Island,” and
“Pollyanna,” the Disney stamp

has been greeted with almost an

.7 aura of regality and even reli-
V giosity. It has become almost anti-
American to knock anything done
by the Walt Disney studio and I
am certainly not going’ to stick
my American foot in my A'merican
mouth and be brought up before
the House Un—American activities.
I think it would be safe to say
that the Disney product doesn’t
and has never meant to tax the
,__, mind. The-(main feature of his
-. < work has always been for the
sheer enjoyment and entertain-
‘ment contained in most of the
man’s creations. Indeed it has been
very rare when a production from
Burbank has failed to hit the en-

tertainment bulls-eye. The latest

production, “The Sword in the
Stone” holds true to every prin-
ciple that Disney has ever stood
‘for -— fun, games and frolic for

2,; everyone. Technicolor, music clev-
 er creations, and a wonderful
-"Waste. No pretense, no ostentation,
no intricacy on the partof Walt

Disney. He‘ makes the days-‘of the ‘

. youthfulKing ‘Arthur come to life

other amazing rung in the fan-
tastic Disneyu success and pop-
ularity “ladder.

color—naming) may ﬁll out with theircolor name entries,‘
Fair is fair. Incidentally, this sort of effort is called ‘jmer-ii

Wrestlers Bad Luck
’ Beganstln 1962

 

Wrestling coach Rex Peery must have felt like Napo-
lean would have felt commanding a campus ROTC unit
as he watched his wrestlers defeat defending Eastern

_ champions Syracuse last ‘Saturday.

The win over Syracuse was a pleasant surprise for
Peery, but the fact of the matter is that some of Peery’s
past teamswould have annihilated the team Syracuse
presented Saturday.

Syracuse had only four'mem-
bers of its championship team in
the lineup, and only two of them—-
123—poun,der Terry Haise and 177-

wrestling in their actual weight
classes. The other two —— 137-
pounder .Jim Murrin and 147-
pounder Dick Slutzky — were
wrestling at heavyweight and 157-
pound, respectively. 
Peery couldn’t have helped
but wonder what his team would
have done to the depleted ranks of

 

BOB SMIZIK

I Syracuse if he had the team he planned to have this.
_season. ' 1

But Peery doesn’t have that team. A fantastic string
of bad luck has robbed him of a team which would have
run away with Eastern honors this year and been a
favorite to win the National title also. ,
The run of misfortune began in August of 1962

. when touted sophomore Ken Warnick failed out of school

on a course he didn’t need to take. It ended last week

when Peery lost four ﬁrst string wrestlers — included

among them three potential Eastern champions —— due
to bad grades.
Jeffries A Family Man

Peery will be without Warnick, Tom Jeffries, John

Carr, Tim Gay, Bill Buchanan and Dave Clery this ’

season due, except in Jeffries case, to bad grades. J effries,
a 191-pounder, dropped from school before last season
to support his family.

‘ Peery began building a would’-be championship
team in 1961, when he brought in among others,
Jeffries, Gay and Ken Barr. Jeffries was so highly

, thought-of that he was considered a disappointment
when he ﬁnished third in the Easterns as a sopho-
more. He was tabbed as a sure bet to win the Eastern
title the following year. He never competed after his
sophomore season.

Barr, who didn’t even come here on a full scholar-
ship, surprised everyone by ﬁnishing second at 177-
pounds in Easterns as a sophomore in 1962. He did the
same thing last year and was the favorite to win the
title this season. A pre-season knee injury kept Barr out
of the Syracuse match, and his effectiveness this year
may be hindered by that injury.

Gay sat on the bench for two seasons, but got his
chance in Easterns last year and ﬁnished third. He fol-
lowed that up by ﬁnishing sixth in Nationals. He was
declared ineligible last week because of not having pass-
ed enough credits over the past two trimesters, even
though he had a QPA well above 2.0.

Three State Champions

Perry brought in the nucleus of his championship
team in 1962 when three former Pennsylvania high
school champions—Carr, Mike Johnson and Lee Hall en-
rolled here. Warnick entered with that group and after

'his freshman season was considered only behind four-

time state titlist Johnson asa prospect. He never wrest-
led .a varsity meet here.

Carr failed out last week. Only Johnson, Hall, Frank
O’Korn and Tom Heniﬂ? remain from the best freshman
wrestling team ever brought in here.

Peery put the ﬁnal touches on his team by bring-
ing in Dino Boni, Clery and Buchanan last year.
Clery won the pre-season Wilkes tournament 137-
pound title as_ a frosh, something even Johnson
couldn’t do. He also failed out last week, at the same
time Buchanan was declared ineligible.

If all had gone well — Peery could have started a
tournament team this year consisting of — from 123-
pounds to heavyweight — Johnson, Clery, Warnick,
Carr, Gay, Hall, Barr, Jeffries and Buchanan.

But Peery’s dream team never made the grade aca-
demically. Without them Peery faces the greatest coach-
ing challenge since he came here‘ in 1950 and had a
team that was winless in ten outings. '

LEWISBURG, Pa. -
Coach Bob Timmons’ Pan-
ther basketball team seeks
its third straight win (the
-Peru game does not count
in the team’s official rec-

ord) here tonight against Buck— '

nelll.

The Bisons made their record
identical with the Panthers, 6-4,
by defeating Gettysburg, 78-58,
Saturday. They have also lost
to Westminster, the team which
came in fourth in the Steel
«Bowl, 83-76, in a game player
here. a - x

Bucknell is having trouble
with its shooting this season,
hitting on only 37 per cent of

- its ‘shots. Athletic publicity di-

rector Brad Tufts said, “Things
are looking better. We broke
a three game losingwstreak on
Saturday night.” '
The Panthers will have to’
play a game similar to the
ﬁrst half of the Penn State
game to lose tonight. While
Bucknell’s record os the same
as Pitt’s, its competition has
not been of the same quality.
The biggest man on coach
Gene .Evans’ team is 6-foot-4

Lorry Hathaway from Mt. Leb- "

anon, Pa. Hathaway is aver-
aging almost -8 points a game
and 14 rebounds to lead the

-team in both departments.

‘Hathaway got off to a slow
start this season, not even start-
ing the ﬁrst three games. But
since scoring 26 points against
Westminster he has been play-
ing the type of ball that made
him the leading scorer and re-
bounder last season as a soph-
omore.

The other probable’ starters
are: 6-foot—2 Larry Kozella,

playing forward with Hatha-_

way, e i t h e r 6-foot—2 Tom
Mitchell ‘or 6-foot-3 Bill Head-
ley at center, and John Mathews

and either Don Hester or Karl

Like the Panthers, Bucknell
fouls often. They are aver-
‘ aging at little over 20 fouls per
game. Deﬁnitely they have
given up 68.7 points per game
while averaging 70.4.
Publicity Director Tufts add-
ed, “Pitt can expect both a man-
to-man and zone defense. We
don't have much height, but
we’ll try" to give them a good
game.” While this remains to

be seen, it is probable that the

game won’t be any worse than
the Panthers 107-6 win over
Dartmouth.

’Tonight’s game should be a
good warm-up for the West
Virginia game Saturday. A ma-
jor burden of the West Virginia
game will depend on Paul Krie-
ger. Krieger must not only
score and rebound, but also
must hold the Mountaineers
6-foot-8 Tom Lowry.

Krieger showed he is ready for
the job by getting 155 rebounds
against Penn State, six more
than‘ anyone else. Timmons
played him all the way against
State- “We need his experience
against those good,~big teams,”
said Timmons. .

Eastern Gym‘ League Changes. Scoring

New Rules Keep Scores Close

3,; FRED BERLIN

Judging from the score of last Satur-
day’s gym meet between the Panthers
and Syracuse '—— 147.5-144.5 in favor of the
Orange —- the matchwas an extremely
close one. Yet _it was a new type of scor-
ing system, rather than the talent of
coach Warren Neiger’s team which made the
match seem as close as it was. _

Under last year’s scoring system Syracuse
would have won, 54%-3811;, not a runaway, but
certainly not as close as the actual‘ score ap-
peared to be.

The reason for such a marked change was

the .recent decision by Eastern _,Intercol1egiate' -

Gymnastic League oﬂicials to revise the scor-
ing method in the ‘league. _
Under the old procedure a team received
six points for a ﬁrst place, four for a second,
three for a third, two for a fourth, and one‘
for ﬁfth. Any individuals’ score, which was
based on a rating scale of 100, had no effect
upon the total team scoring. Only his placing
effected the team score.
This season the ﬁnal outcomeis proportional
to the success of each competitor’s performance.
The maximum possible point total for any single

gymnast in any one event is ten and the team's
overall points are simply-the sum of each indi-
viduals score.

The use of this type of scoring gives a better.

indication of actual team ability. Under the old
method team A may; have had scores of 99, 98
and 97 in one event, while team B may have
scored 96, 95, and 95. While the competition was
very close, team A would have scored "13 points
to only three for team "B. 1
Under the new system team A would have
still led, 'but by a much na_rrower_ margin.
Team A would have "scored 29.4 points to 28.6
points for team B — a much more "accurate
account of what happened. , _
_ Panther coach Warren Neiger was pleased
with the newrule changes“ He said, “Before, it
didn’t matter how well anyone actually did. The
only important thing was what place they were
able to win. Using this new way, every boy con-
tributes to the score.” ' '

In Saturday’s Syracuse battle the Orange
grabbed off 17 places "in comparison with only
13 by the Panthers.. Syracuse had four ﬁrsts,
four seconds, two _thirds, ﬁve fourths, and two
ﬁfths, while the Panthers were accumulating
two ﬁrsts, two seconds, ‘ﬁve thirds, one fourth,
and three ﬁfths.

‘All-Opponent Team! Named‘ .
Football Team Picks,
Mira Over Staubach

By BOB DEQUINZE

Panther football players put an end to any doubt as
to who was the best quarterback they faced this year
when they voted George Mira of Miami as the signal-
caller on their all-opponent team. -

Mira gained the nod over unanimous all—America
and Heisman Trophy winner Roger Staubach of Navy.

Joining Mira in the backﬁeld - 
were Bill Wolski of Notre Dame,
Dick Lefridge of West Virginia and
Charlie Browning of Washington.
the team chose two fullbacks —
Lefridge and Browning —- since
both played such outstanding games
against them. '

The all-opponent ‘line consisted of
Jim Campbell of Navy and Don Caum
of Penn State at ends, Roger Foster of
. California and Dan Conners of Miami

at tackles, guards Rick Redman of
Washington and Bob Lehman of Notre
Dame and center Ralph Baker of Penn State.

Although Staubach led Navy to a win over the /Panthers
and Mira performed in a losing cause, the players apparently
were swayed by the sensational passing performance that Mira
put on. The Hurricanes may have won the game if some of their
ends had been able to hold on to more of Mira’s passes.

Mira was chosen as the outstanding back the team faced.

It was also the second straight year that Mira made the all-

opponent‘ team. Baker also was chosen forgthe second time.

Notre Dame’s Lehman was tabbed as the\ outstanding line-
man the’ team faced. The linebacker made 18 ‘tackles against
the Panthers. _ « ,

' Washington was cited, by the players as the hardest—hitting
team and !Navy, the only team to defeat the Panthers, was
voted the best team faced.

1964: YEAR OF DECISION

Well sir, here we go into 1964, which shows every sign of being

quite a distinguished year. First off, it is the only year since

1954 which ends with the Figure 4. Of course, when it comes

’ to Figure 4’s, 1964, though distinguished, can hardly compare
with 1444 which, most people agree, had not just one, not just,
two, but three Figure 4’s! This, I’ll wager, is a record that will
stand for at least a thousand years! ‘

1444 was, incidentally, notable for many other things/. It
was, for example, the year in which the New York Giants
played the Philadelphia Athletics in the World Series. As We
all know, the New York Giants have since.moved to San Fran-

. cisco and the Philadelphia Athletics to Kansas City. There is
a movement afoot at present to move Chicago to Phoenix-
the city, not the baseball team. Phoenix, in turn, would of
course move to Chicago. It is felt that the change would be
broadening for residents of both cities. Many Chicago folks,
for example, have never seen an iguana. Many Phoenix folks,
on the other hand, have never seen a frostbite.

There are, of course, certain difficulties cor.\‘)3cted with a
- municipal shift of this size. For instance, to move Chicago
you also have to move Lake Michigan. This, in itself, presents
no great problem, what with modern scientiﬁc advances like
electronics and the'French cuff. But if you will look at your
map, you will ﬁnd Lake Michigan is attached to all the other
Great Lakes, which in turn are attached to the St. Lawrence
Seaway, which in turn is attached to the Atlantic Ocean. You
start dragging Lake Michigan to Phoenix and, wi1ly—nilly, you’ll
be dragging all that other stuff too. This would make our
British allies terribly cross, and I can’t say as I blame them.
Put yourself in their place. What if, for example, you were a
British costermonger who had been saving and scrimping! all
year for a summer holiday at Brighton Beach, and then when
you got to Brighton ‘Beach there wasn’ t any ocean? There you’d
be with your inner tube and snorkel and nothing to do all day
but dance the Lambeth Walk. This, you must agree, would not
help make you NATO-minded! -

I appeal most earnestly to the residents of Chicago and
Phoenix to reconsider. I know it’s no bowl of cherries going
through life without ever seeing an iguana or, a frostbite, but
I ask you—Chicagoans, Phoenicians-is it too big a price
pay for preserving the unity of the free world? ‘

I feel sure that if you search your hearts, you will make the
right decision, for all of us—whether we live in frostbitten
Chicago, iguana-infested Phoenix, 'or narrow-lapelled New
Haven—are ﬁrst and foremost~Arnericans! '

But I digress. We were speaking of 1964, our new year. And
new it is! There is, for one thing, new pleasure in Marlboro
Cigarettes. How, you ask, can there be new pleasure in
Marlboros when that ﬁne ﬂavorfulblend of tobaccos, that clean
eﬂicient Selectrate ﬁlter, have not been altered? The answer is
simple: each time you light a Marlboro, it is like the ﬁrst time.
The ﬂavor is such that age cannot wither nor custom stale.
Marlboro never palls, never jades, never dwindles into dull ,
routine. Each puﬂ’, each cigarette, each pack, each carton,
makes you glad all over again that you are a Marlboro smoker!

- A Therefore, Marlboros in hand, let us march conﬁdently into
1964. May goodfortune attend our ventures! May serenity
reign! May Chicago and Phoenix soon recover from their dis-
appointment and join our bright cavalcade into a brave to-
morrow! ‘ en 1964 Max shuimu
* IF *

We, the makers of Marlboros, available in soft pack“ or flip-
top box in all ﬁfty states of the Union, wish to join Old Max
in extending good wishes for q Vliappgyg gggzgl peaceful 1964.
