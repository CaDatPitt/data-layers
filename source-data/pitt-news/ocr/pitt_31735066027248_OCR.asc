Master plan to lead Piﬂ into future

By Sandra Bennet, Nathan Hughes
and Ed Abolins
The Pitt News

[This is the third in a three—part series on
Oakland by'a Pitt journalism class. See
the Sports Section for a related story on
the Convocation Center.]

One thing community groups, Pitt stu-
dents and administration agree on is that
Oakland has its problems. The solution
has arrived, sort of — The Master Space
Plan.

A tome filled with diagrams, pictures
and maps, the Master Space Plan will
attempt to lead Pitt into the 21st century
by redesigning existing buildings, tearing

SEAC prepares for Earth Day

By Jennifer McGim1is
Staff Writer

Members of Pitt’s Student
Environmental Action
Coalition collected trash and
policed parking lots in prepa-
ration for the 25th annual
Earth Day this Saturday.

SEAC started off the week
with a Ticket America cam-
paign. SEAC ticketed cars on
the Pitt campus for violations
such as “unnecessary use of
vehicle,” and attached mes-
sages urging people to use p
public transportation to the -
tickets. °

SEAC ticketed on the South
Side yesterday and has plans
to ticket at the Community

College of Allegheny
County’s Earth Day celebra-
tion today.

SEAC held its second recy-
cling drive of the semester
Monday and Tuesday of this
week. The drive was sched-
uled to end today, but so many
recyclables were collected
during the first two days that
the drive had to be shut down
early.

“The bins were all full or

, overﬂowing after two days, so
 I think it went pretty well,"
‘ said Susan Curry of SEAC.

During the last Recycle
Week, Pitt collected over 400 ,
pounds of glass, 120 pounds = 
of ofﬁce paper, 50 pounds of
cardboard, 28 pounds of
alumninum, over 900 pounds

ones. Although it has no budget, esti-
mates for the total cost are $267 million.

Pitt has come up with Master Space
Plans before, as early as the 1960s. But
Jay Roling, director of community
affairs, said this plan is different than
ones from Pitt’s past.

The university has sought the insight of
faculty, staff, residents and students in
making the most recent Master Plan,
according to Roling.

“We would like it to become a living
document which the university will
update as changes are needed,” said
Roling. “It is not chiseled in stone. It is
our best thinking of what we want in the
next five, ten, twenty years.”

The document emphasizes areas of
agreement with the local community, but

has little on student housing (plans for a
new dorm were announced following
criticism after the release of the plan,)
public safety or parking (a consultant’s
report is forthcoming.) According to John
Wilds, director of the governmental rela-
tions office, the university is not really
going to expand.

“The figures aren’t there for the univer-
sity to make another expansion, but a lot
of people got hurt in the last one and
there’s some paranoia,” said Wilds.

Perhaps the paranoia also comes
because the Master Plan doesn’t have real
solutions for the parking or housing prob-
lems that have developed in Oakland.

Today there is an estimated 2,200 unit
deficit in housing at the university.

WIl'l1 new
meal plan

By Sandra Bennett

Members of the Resident
Student Association are
against the proposed changes

say any price increases are
unfair to students.

Although the BLOCK meal
plan will remain in effect next
fall, it will cost more money.
Each block will cost $5.50,
but students who choose to eat

locations like Eddie’s, will

SEAC plans to kick off
Earth Day weekend with a
demonstration encouraging
the use of alternate means of
trasportation. The rally, called
Critical Mass, will begin at 3
p.m. in Market Square.
Members of SEAC and stu-
dents from other schoolsiwill
join downtown and ride their

bicycles in front of the traffic
back to Pitt.

“We are protesting against
the unnecessary use of vehi-
cles,” said one of SEAC’s
Earth Day organizers, Kim
Catanzano. “Vehicles don’t
need to be downtown. We are
urging better bus transporta-
tion, better bike lanes and
walking transportation too.”

Following Critical Mass,

SEAC will hold a rally at the
WPU where they will be
joined by Campus Women’s
Organization, Students for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals,
Black Action Society,
Bisexual Gay and Lesbian
Alliance and Amnesty
International.

Miller said. “The only fair
plan would be an option of

that's not going to happen.”

Other students said the
quality of the food does not
warrant any increase in price.

“It’s ridiculous. The food
sucks anyway,” said student
Mark Nicholas.

Plan
°From page 1

Approximately 1,800 undergrad and 400 grad
beds are needed. Not to mention the intema-
tional students, married students and students
with children who have unique needs of their
own. One possibility is converting Allen Hall,
which is no longer suitable for classrooms,
into graduate apartments.

Wilds and Roling said tentative plans
include the creation of a dormitory at the site
of the old Burger King on Fifth Avenue. There
are possibilities of three four-story structures
to be built on the hill-side area of campus and
another dormitory similar to Sutherland on the
hill top.

The problem of parking is addressed in a
brief paragraph of the Master Plan. Roling and
Wilds spoke of the possibility of two new
parking sites, one next to the Towerview Lot at
UPMC and an underground garage across from
the Forbes Avenue side of the Cathedral, all of
which is speculative. I

According to Roling and Wilds, the main
thing to remember is that the Master Plan is
merely ideas and nothing the community
should fear.

Various citizen action groups have arisen in
Oakland to fight not just against the Master
Space Plan, but for what they consider the
well-being of Oakland.

Sue Golomb of the Oakland Planning
Development Corporation (OPDC), an
Oakland residents’ group that works closely
with the uni_versity and receives some universi-
ty funding, said she would like to see more
variety in Oakland’s shopping district. She
said more short-term parking lots would bring
more shoppers to the area.

The Oakland Neighborhood Alliance is also
concerned about the lack of parking for resi-
dents. ONA favors converting some of the
long-term parking garages and lots in Oakland
into short-term lots, which it thinks would be
more convenient for shoppers and visitors at
local hospitals.

However, the ONA and the OPDC are
against any plans to develop additional long-
term lots because they think the lots will just
cause more congestion. Instead, they would
like to see satellite parking based outside of
Oakland for commuters.

Parking concerns are also one of the reasons
the residents’ groups are against the newly
proposed Convocation Center. The groups said
they fear the center would add to the conges-

tion.

The battle over the Convocation Center has
united the community groups, which in the
past have disagreed over key issues concerning
the development of Oakland. A number of
groups are working with the university on the
Oakland Agreement, a comprehensive plan
and accord to be released in a few months. .

The controversy surrounding the center and
the future of Oakland stems mostly from the
varied and crowded nature of the community.

“Oakland is the most intensely used part of
the city,” said Eloise Hirsh, the Pittsburgh
director of city planning.

It is an area with a mishmash of uses -
commercial, institutional and residential.

“When you have intense use, you have con-
flict,” Hirsh said. ,

The city is planning a major rezoning of
Oakland. Oakland is important to the city
because it is a major employer (approximately
30,000 people work here) in a large residential
area (about 25,000 people live here), along
with being home to Pitt.

Zoning is a way for a city to control what
kind of land use can occur, where and how
dense and fast development will be. Conflicts
typically develop at the edges of certain dis-
tricts, for example, hospitals that border resi-
dential areas or fraternity houses that are next
to private homes. *

The last new zoning was done in 1958. It
wasn’t done in accord with the natural urban
development, according to Hirsh. Oakland is
overdue for a zoning overhaul. '

Hirsh said the city wants the locals to have a
big input in the process, so no definite plans
have been made, but the planning board is con-
sidering treating Oakland as a zoning district,
much like downtown. She said the city is also
considering changes in parking, including
more short-term spaces, to try to ease conges-
tion.

Hirsh would like to wait for community
input in the form of public hearings, focus
groups and discussions with community
groups.

Currently the plans for the future of Oakland
are in flux, but several issues will be resolved
over the next few months as rezoning takes
shape, the Oakland Agreement is announced
and the fate of many aspects of the Master
Plan becomes more clear. It will be a busy
time for Pitt -— with only five years until the
21st century.

(The following is a guest
column from Kathleen
George, the Pitt in London
program director.)

The Study Abroad

getting agent-interest in. Last
night a couple of us went to
hear Martin Amis read. My
classes, of course, go to the
theatre a lot as part of our
curriculum. We've seen
“Hamlet,” “As You Like It,”
“Measure for Measure” and
“Twelfth Night” for the
Shakespeare class. For
Contemporary Theatre we've
seen “Arcadia,” “Indian Ink,”
“Full Moon,” “Yiddish
Trojan Women,” “Inspector
Calls” and “Portrait of a

Woman.” Almost every-
body's favorites were
“Arcadia” and “Twelfth

Night,” but most of what
we've seen has been exciting.
As Kristin said, “People save
up all their money for years
to make a theatre trip to
London, and we’re doing it
and learning how to do it,
how to think about it.”

We also made trips to
Stratford-Upon-Avon,
Stonehenge and Bath as a
group. Stratford, of course,
was also a theatre trip. We
went to Shakespeare’s Globe,
which is under construction
and due to open in a year. We
had the Time Out theatre edi-
tor and critic Jane Edwardes
come to speak to the class
and Sam Walters, director of
the Orange Tree, spoke to us
at his theatre after a perfor-
mance. Some Royal
Shakespeare Company actors
from their “Twelfth Night”
are coming to class to do a
lecture/demonstration. Lots
of students have been going
to see things on their own —
everything from the big musi-
cals to Albee’s “Three Tall
Women” with Maggie Smith
playing the lead, and the vio-
lent American play “Killer
Joe” — which is a big hit
here. (Star-gazing note:
Garrin saw Patrick Stewart in
the Hard Rock Cafe but
didn’t bother him. I would
have.) »

LIVING - ARRANGE-
MENTS: The people who
decided to stay in Field Court
House, the dormitory-style
student residence in
Kensington, are happy with
it. Julie said there’s always
something to do. They like
being in the middle of
Kensington. “We’re a 15-
minute walk from Di,”
Maggie said. I think it was
tongue-in-cheek. The stu-
dents say they’re like a fami-
ly. They cook for each other,
tell each other to be careful
when going out, that kind of
thing. But the people on
homestays are (luckily) just
as keen about their arrange-
ments. The host families must
be doing a good job, because
Leslie, Kara, Adrienne talk
all the time about the dinners,
the children, etc. in their fam-
ilies.

INTERNSHIPS: The
internships are proving
worthwhile. Robert was at the
news station late on one of
the first nights in London

doing a big story. Garrin
spends a lot of time at the
publishing house he's placed
with. Kara says the differ-
ences in English and
American hospitals are sig-
nificant, and Andrea is work-
ing with a travel agent on a
conservation-work program
for the Canary Islands — “to
put something back into the
land and not just take out,”
she said.

TRAVEL: Additional travel
is a big part of the experience

Denise, Bob and Kara went to
Dublin by coach and ferry.
They loved,Dublin, Trinity
College, the Writer's
Museum, the tour of the
coastline and St. Patrick’s.
Six went to Paris and
Amsterdam and several to
Wales. Most of the trips to
the cities I’ve just mentioned
were organized by the Center
for Academic Programs
Abroad — our local contact
organization. The students
feel the trips are good, effi-

students spent Spring Break
in Scotland. Nicki wants
other students back home to
know London is a perfect
stepping stone to other coun-
tries and culture, a way for
non-travelled Americans to
get started in learning about
the world. It’s do-able, she
said, because a student has
the language to start, but it's
definitely not America.

“And it puts the States into

perspective,” Sarah said.
“From over here, you look at
America differently.”

ed in getting to Prague.

go up [to get more food,] but
as far as Eddie’s, they should
give the same equivalent [as
blocks cost] because you can
only go up one time,” said
Alana Kurtz, who plans to live
on-carnpus next year’.

RSA is urging students to
tell their parents about the
price increases. The group had
considered responding to the
proposed meal plan with a
petition, but decided against it
because they did not think
they had enough time before
the end of the semester.

-“I’m kind of in a bind as to
what to do because resident
students are required to buy
blocks,” Miller said. “Most
students living on campus are
unhappy and disgusted that
they have to cover for [Food
Service’s] poor planning. But
students don’t know what they
can do about it because they

are required to buy meal -

plans.”

RSA members said they are

afraid further changes to the
BLOCK plan will be made
during the summer, when
RSA and the Student
Government Board will not be
able to speak out in behalf of
the students. -
‘ Miller said he does not
believe Food Services seeks
enough input from students
when devising meal plans. He
wants to form a standing com-
mittee of campus residents to
work with the department.
Most students seem to agree
with the idea.

“I think a committee would
probably work,” said student
Scott Riley. “But there’s not
enough people who really
care. It wouldn’t work in the
Towers because the people are
too young, but it would proba-
bly work in the upperclass
dorms.”

with each other. “At 9:00 [p.m.]
we are having a candlelight vigil
for all the oppressed species on
earth; to remember all the ani-
mals and trees destroyed in the
past year,” Catanzano said.

SEAC is hosting a cainpout
on the union lawn Friday night

On Earth Day, from 12 to 4
p.m., SEAC and other student
and community groups are
putting informative booths up

talists will also perform
Saturday afternoon.

“We are trying to promote
unity — that’s the whole key of
this thing,” Catanzano said. “We
all need to work together to get
this to happen.”

“We are trying to steer away
from the usual Earth Day of cel-
ebration. For us, it’s not a cele-
bration,” Catanzano added.
“This is geared toward promot-
ing activism, renewing what's
been lost and promoting action
to ﬁx it.”

 Opinions   -

R? d f’ 'ng agendas

Last night, President Bill Clinton held a press conference in
which he addressed the recent actions by the Congress. The point
of his opening statement was welfare reform, challenging the
Congress to put a welfare reform bill on his desk by the Fourth
of July. His tone was somewhat conciliatory, and he must make
sure that his willingness to compromise does not compromise the
nation’s future. Children should not be punished for their parents.
As President Clinton said, training must be a part of any welfare
reform package in order to make these people truly independent.

“I was not elected to produce a pile of vetoes,” the_ President
said. But that does not mean he should be unwilling to use the
veto to prevent programs which are harmful to the American
people from coming into law. The programs which are being
ram-rodded through the legislative process are not the will of
“the American people.” They will benefitthose Americans who
have reaped the benefits of the growth in income inequality, but
they will not allow this country to move into the future.

President Clinton also said he is trying to help the debate in
this country focus on what is best for the nation to do. As he cor-
rectly pointed out, many people are becoming alienated by the

‘ debates in this country because they see it as dominated on both

sides by extremists. The debate does need to be recast, and the
president must make sure that makes the utmost of his position to
do so.

When asked to address issues such as affirmative action, the
president revealed his insight into the new issues facing the
American people. The problems facing the “angry white male”,
as one reporter termed them, were the fact that income is declin-
ing because of the emergence of technology, the collapse of min-
imum wage, the decline of organized labor and the tax and bud-
get policies of the twelve years before he took office. Recent sta-
tistics released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the
income of men in all groups except those with four or more years
of education has declined by as much as seven percent since
1979.

This country needs to redefine its agenda, not by the ideologi-
cal smoke screens thrown up by conservative think tanks who
think that economic growth is stifled by the breakdown of the
family. Families breakdown with the economy. If the top one
percent of this country had not been siphoning off all the wealth
and reducing opportunity for all but themselves, perhaps
America would not be facing the problems of social decay it is
facing today. .

President Clinton is right that we are in the middle of a historic
change. What the federal government does now will determine
how well this country fares in the next century. Now is the time
for people to stand up and be heard. Let the government know
that they must not undermine the future in their slash and burn
efforts to control the deficit. As President Clinton said, tax cuts
should target the middle class and aid in education, not serve to
exacerbate the growing inequality which threatens to destroy this
nation.

Have you got lire rogue sun time?

his is my last column

I for the year, so I hope

you'll indulge me by

allowing me to take forever

to get to the point. OK? Here
we go.

Recently I stumbled across
a gem of wisdom from the
most brilliant and profound
American philosopher of the
late 20th century, Jack
Handey. It went something
like this:

I wish I lived on a planet
that had two suns — regular
sun and “rogue” sun. That
way, when somebody asked
me what time it was, I’d say,
“Regular time?” And they'd
say, “Yeah.” And I’d say,
“Sorry, all I have is rogue
time.” It'd be fun to be a
stuck-up rogue-time guy. -

The fact that this was print-
ed on a daily flip-calendar
(“Deep Thoughts” by Jack
Handey, just $9.95 at any
fine bookstore near you) in
no way diminishes its sub-
lime nature. Never before
have I seen such a beautifully
stated description of one of
the fundamental dichotomies
of human nature: people want
to be “regular,” but they also
want to be “rogues.”

To be more explicit: There
are many people who take
comfort in knowing that they
aren’t abnormal. They want
to have things in common
with others so that they are
able to relate and enjoy inter-
personal contact with the
majority of the population
around them. These people
are roughly analogous to
Handey’s regular-sun time-
keepers.

On the other hand, there
are also many people who
derive pleasure from their
uniqueness. They feel that
they aren’t really individuals
unless they are obviously
separate and distinguishable
from the majority of the pop-
ulation around them. These
people are more or less
equivalent to Handey’s
rogue-sun timekeepers.

There is logical reasoning

behind both of these perspec-
tives, and flaws in both as
well. If one conforms to the
masses too much, then there
certainly is the danger of los-
ing the ability to think for
oneself. However, if one
completely withdraws from
society and rejects every
facet of it, one ceases to be a
useful member of the human
race. (I’m not talking here
about someone like Thoreau,
who wanted to be alone and
self-dependent but still pon-
dered the ways of the world.
I mean utterly rejecting
humanity, a la Jeffrey
Dahmer.)

However, most people do
not belong to either extreme.
Rather, they embody both
tendencies to some degree --

they want to be somehow
uniquely special while main-
taining the ability to function
as a part of human society.
Generally speaking, this is a
healthy attitude to have 
 but not always. (Finally!
The dull stuff is over. I told
you I’d get to_ the point even-
tually.) The problem arises
with the sad fact that many
people, upon reaching a cer-
tain arbitrary point in their
lives (frequently high school
or college), decide that
they’ve been regular too long
and it’s time to turn rogue -
but they lack the creativity
and sense of self necessary to
really be their own individu-
als. Therefore, they desper-
ately look around them for
other people who seem. “dif-
ferent” and imitate them
exactly. This is the main rea-
son one can find huge groups
of people all doing fruitless
things together, like:

1. Adopting the grunge
look, punk look, etc. There
is absolutely nothing wrong
with these looks in and of
themselves; everyone should
be free to appear exactly as
they wish, whether that
means a pierced nose, dread-
locks or a suit and tie. What I
object to is the entire phe-
nomenon of trends. If being

different is, in fact, the goal,
why go out of the way to take
on a persona that’s shared by
thousands of others?

2. Trying to revive the
‘60s counterculture. I’m
sure the ‘60s were a fascinat-
ing time to be a young
American, but 30 years have
passed since then. A changed
world demands new ways to
interact with it; Bob Dylan,
the voice of the ‘60s, would
have been the first to admit
this. Even if being a part of
Generation X is not so great,
if we slavishly imitate our
parents’ generation, we’re
not really rebelling, are we?
3. Getting wastedlhighl
stoned. I’m not going to
waste everyone's time by
going off on an anti-drug
rant, because it’s old hat.
Suffice it to say that there is
not one person on this earth
who is not capable of finding
their identity and having
plenty of fun along the way
without using a chemical
crutch.

The point that I hope I’m
getting across is a simple
one: it’s impossible to be a
unique individual by jumping
on to whatever this year’s
alternative/rebel/shock-value
bandwagon is. In other
words, being a nonconforrnist
by conforming to the other
nonconformists is a contra-
diction in terms. The only
way to be a real noncon-
formist is to think —— think
about the world, think about
your place in it, think about
what exists at the center of
your being that is indepen-
dent of the rest of the uni-
verse.

If anyone would like help
with this, or has questions of
any sort, feel free to call me.
I can be reached every day,
sometime after 64 o’clock.

I’m on rogue sun time, of
course. -

The Pitt News, Wednesday, April 19, 1995 4 T

The Internet must be protec

nee in a while a situation occurs
Othat brings to light the most
important amendment that our
founding fathers had the insight to cre-
ate. In fact, it is the First Amendment
and there is a reason why it comes first.

In case you haven’t read the First
Amendment lately, here is what it
says: ‘

“Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of reli-
gion, or prohibiting the free exercise
thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press, or the right
of the people peaceably to assemble,
and to petition the government for a
redress of grievances.”

Well, there it is, and as a very
intelligent man by the name of John
Frohnmayer, who I will be mention-
ing later, said: “Memorize the First
Amendment, it’s 45 words and will
take you 10 minutes.” .

The First Amendment protects the
right to believe in the religion we
choose, to be different entities, to
approach the government in dis-
agreement and most importantly to

communicate to others our beliefs. In
essence, the First Amendment is the
very tool behind democracy.

John Frohnmayer’s recent visit to
the university is a reminder to us
how important it is to protect the
First Amendment. As the former
chairman for the National
Endowment for the Arts, he took a
strong stand against Senator Jesse
Helms’ 1989 amendment to the NEA
appropriation. This amendment pro-
hibits obscene and indecent material
including depictions of sado-
masochism, homo-eroticism, the
exploitation of children or individu-
als engaged in sex acts or material
which denigrates the objects or
beliefs of a particular religion or
non—religion. The amendment was
writ-ten in response to a Robert
Mapplethorpe exhibit.

Excuse me, but doesn’t this contra-
dict everything the First Amendment
stands for? I can understand that
individuals may find exhibits of
pornography offensive, but then the
person should not visit the exhibit. It

ted by the First Amendment

is not the government's place to set
restrictions on what will or will not
be disclosed to the public.

The same is true of Senator James
Exon’s Communications Decency
Act which passed the Senate
Commerce Committee without hear-
ings in late March. In the name of
protecting the young and impression-
able, Senator Exon proposes
extremely harsh punishments on
those who post the lewd, lascivious,
filthy and indecent on the Internet.

In both these cases the government
is trying to protect people from being
exposed to obsenity, yet it never
even tries to define obsenity. What
one person finds offensive may not
be so for another. This protection of
Americans from being exposed to
“obsenity” gives the illusion to
mindless beings who can not actively
select the material we view. Just as it
takes time and effort to choose to go
to an art museum, the same is true
about pulling documents from the
Internet. It requires computer knowl-
edge and access to view pornograph-

7.

ic or obscene images on the Net. In
many cases a credit card number and
proof of age is required. Further,
there is technology available, such as
passwords, that can block youths
from accessing such offerings.
Instead of considering these options,
senators like Exon would‘ rather
infringe on our rights as Americans
and jeopardize the First Amendment.

Along with the many positive
opportunities free speech gives us,
we must‘ also realize it will occasion-

ally offend us. As John Frohnmayer '

said in a speech given at this univer-
sity, “If we are never offended, then
we better look out, because the views
that should offend us, and there are
plenty of them, are not being heard.”
I think Senator Exon should stop
worrying about Americans being
offended and get a'clue as to what
the Internet is all about and the many
incredible advantages it will provide
to this country.

Satire was barbaric

In the article, “Columnist
offers suggestions for using
death penalty” (The Pitt
News, April 10), Evan
Gallahou wrote,
“Furthermore,the rest of his
body (the criminal’s) could
be chopped up and used for
dog food and food for starv-
ing children in Third World
countries.”

It is not my intention here,
to ‘question the merits of his
various barbaric suggestions
clothed in - the garb of
“satire.” The reference, how-

ever, to the children of the .

Third World is loathsome,
and no amount of latitude can
accomodate his insolence.
His attempt to jest in this
morbid manner offends my
sensibility. Let none think
that he is being criticized for
being just politically incor-
rect. It is this public display
of ignorance and contempt
for a large part of humanity
that is objectionable.

I hope The Pitt News will
find it appropriate to write an
apology for publishing the
article. I

Poor Citizenship

I am absolutely amazed at
Denver Dash’s letter to the
editor on Tuesday.

Mr. Dash practices poor
mathematics, poor memory,
and poor US citizenship. He
forgets that in the United
States, there are three branch-
es of government. The leg-
islative, the executive, and
the judicial "branches. In
order for any bill to be
passed into law which includ-
ed spending bill, it must be
passed by two separate enti-
ties of ‘the legislative branch,
the House of Representatives,
and the Senate. During the
1980s, Democrats controlled
both houses, let me repeat,
Democrats Mr. Dash, passed
all the bills during the 1980s.
They agreed with Ronald
Reagan, and then gave the
bills they passed, to Reagan,
for him to sigri. He was not
solely responsible. Mr. Dash
forgot that some 280 other
people were needed to pass
the bills.

Mr. Dash also forgets what

IEIXCS,

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

inflation is. He should go
recalculate his numbers.
While he is doing that, he

should also look at the

amount of money the Federal
government received in
when they were
reduced. The income nearly
doubled in real dollars. What
went wrong was poor fiscal

responsibility’ with all the

money that the Federal gov-
ernment received. They used
all that extra ‘money and bor-
rowed some, to increase
spending on social and mili-
tary programs. The military
programs were reduced, and
the taxes increased since
then.

It is now time to reduce the
taxes and social spending and
practice sound fiscal deci-
sions regarding the debt,
something the Democrat con-
gresses have been able and
unwilling to do, whomever
was the President. Now, a
Republican congress is tak-
ing care of the deficit by
increasing revenue and
decreasing spending.

FIJI unfairly branded

This letter is in response to
John Cihon’s letter to The
Pitt News regarding the
Greek system. Yes, I said
Greek system and not FIJI.
The problem that the Greek
system faces today is, sim-
ply stated, a negative stereo-
type.

The brothers of FIJI have
taken it upon themselves to
attempt to repair the reputa-
tion of not only the Greek
system, but of the university
as a whole. We, as a fraterni-
ty, went out on our own and
performed countless hours
of community service, and
will continue to do so indefi-
nitely. Fraternal organiza-
tions should do more service
than simply participating in
Greek Week.

We realize that not only
has FIJI been branded,
but also the entire Greek
system. FIJI is trying
to repair the unwarranted
damage that has been done
to our reputation as well as
the reputation of the univer-
sity. V

Despite the allegations,

FIJI has been able to main-
tain our commitment to the
public. Our brothers are
active in the University and
in the community. ‘We
encourage our brothers
to participate in all campus
activities. FIJIs are actively
involved in university
sports, the IFC (its president
is a FIJI), The Pitt News
and many other campus
organizations, as we have
been for years. FIJI had
a very, successful spring

rush, placed second in Greek '

Week for Charity by raising

over $5,000 for Family A_

House and placed third in

overall Greek Week (even -

though we are on social pro-
bation).

FIJI has been an active
membervof the university
since 1863. The social ser-
vice activities highlighted in
the article were not the
result of sanctions, but
rather the continuation of
132 years of involvement
with both the city and the
University of Pittsburgh.

attractive, I’ve devised several reasons for tak-

ing advantage of the beautiful thing called
spring (i.e., discovering new and interesting excuses
for cutting class).

1.) Boring Classes — never overlook the obvi-
ous; this is probably the most applicable excuse,
for nearly every class, at some point, becomes
boring and/or repetitious.

2.) Coffee — the nearly universal excuse for
skipping anything ——- not enough coffee, too much
coffee, the pursuit of’ coffee, the making of coffee,
etc.

3.) Expensive Beverages Better Found
Elsewhere — (i.e., Mountain Dew), it is outra-
geous that Mountain Dew is now 65 cents (I’m not
overlooking Coke and Pepsi), and one can find, if
one is industrious, Mountain Dew at a cheaper
price (i.e., outside of class, at a different locale).

4.) People Watching —- one can get bored with
watching the same people in the same class; meet-
ing and watching new people is an exciting activi-

S ince the weather (by and large) has become so

ty, and most enjoyable.

5.) Lack of Completed Homework — well, if
one is unprepared for class, how much sense does
it make attending class to sit there idly, and smile
and nod? .

6.) Window Shopping — a wonderful activity,
one must catch up on every now and then; if only
to appreciate the finer things one cannot afford (of
course, this could lead to mild depression, another

_excuse that can be utilized).

7.) Crossword Puzzles — although I am not a
fanatic, I know people who are; to stop in mid-
puzzle disturbs one’s train of thought, and this

simply won’t do. One must either complete the T

puzzle or give up and toss it out.

8.) Death of a Pet — I realize this is morbid, but
valid. When my goldfish died, I was extremely
upset and found it difficult to concentrate. Now
that I have a dog, I find that his living makes me
upset and difficult to concentrate.

a.) taking care of one’s pet — pet care is time-
consuming, especially in the case of dogs, they

need walked, groomed, fed, run on Flagstaff, tons
of things. A pet alone can occupy a good majority

of one’s day, given one can “space out” pet care-

activities.

10.) Extracurricular Book Reading — a rather
moot point, but what the hell, an intelligent
excuse.

11) Kid Watching —— observing children at play
is most amusing, and can make one glad one is not
the authority figure in charge.

12) Good Company — an excuse in and of
itself; if one is with interesting people, why leave?

There is probably a myriad of other fabulous
excuses, nuclear war, power shortage so one can-
not rely on the digital clock radio, etc. Or, you
might just ﬂip a coin to decide if you’re going to
attend class, a tactic I often use. (Usually I employ
the two-out-of-three method.) These spring days
are limited, waste them while you can.

down, Pitt fans have once.
again suffered through a year
of mediocre sports teams. A
few teams have been good, a
few have been bad. Let’s
take a look at the ones I like.

Football — Johnny Majors
and Co. excited some fans
this year with a wide-open
style of football. The offense
was second in the Big East,
led by Billy West, who led
the conference in rushing. If
John Ryan started the entire
year and played at the pace
he did the last four games,
he would have led the nation
in passing proficiency. The
defense, on the other hand,
displayed more holes than

Convocation is center of controversy

B Sean Duncan 
Spins Editor "*~*--Ty ”  -. 1

The Convocation Center --
even the name itself generates
controversy.

“Call it what you want, dress it
however you want, it’s still a bas-
ketball arena,” Chairman of the
Oakland Neighborhood Alliance
Marshall Goodwin said. ‘”There’s
just no need for a Convocation
Center for 12,000 students.”

Out of all the proposals in Pit1’s
Master Space Plan, which is sup-
posed to transform the future of
the University of Pittsburgh, the
Convocation Center appears to be
the most controversial.

In fact, the two major parties
involved in the Convocation
Center, representatives of the
Oakland community and Pitt, are _ *
so in ﬂux that the project is cur-
rently at ground zero.

“Although we know what we
want, there has not been a date
set,” Athletic Director Oval
Jaynes said. “I know that sounds
vague, but there’s no time table.”

Oakland community represen-
tatives are concerned with the
problems of parking, traffic and
the true need for a center of this
magnitude. They believe Pitt's
money should go to more impor-

The proposed space for the Convocation Center is in the "OC" parking lot by Pitt Stadium.

‘Soccer —— The soccer team
struggled through a dismal
conference season, going 1-
6-1. Their non-conference
schedule gave them the
opportunity to finish above
.500 at 9-8-1.

Their grade? D+.

,Women’s volleyball —
The volleyball team was one
of the bright spots of this
Pitt sports year. They won
their seventh consecutive
Big East crown and sur-
prised Iowa in the first round
of the NCAA tournament
before losing to powerhouse
Notre Dame.

We have our first good
grade, an A.

Wrestling —- The wrestling
team had a very successful
season. They finished 21st in
the nation and two wrestlers,
J.J. Fasnacht and John
Withrow, earned All-
American honors. They beat
Penn State for the first time
in 19 years and grappled
their way to a 14-9 meet
record.

Uh—oh, our second good
grade, another A.

Men's basketball —— No
team on campus captured the
hearts of the remaining five
Pitt fans more than Ralph
Willard’s frick-frack crew.
Going into the season, five
wins would have been con-
sidered a success. But, the
Panthers, led by Jaime
Peterson, fought their way to
a 11-18 (5-13) record. Turn
to the “Guiness Book of
World Records” and you will
find that the Pitt team set the
record for close losses.

But good teams win those
games. They get a B-.

and _now they’re spending money
on a basketball court?”

Even with the Oakland repre-
sentatives’ obvious displeasure
over the Center, what's really
holding down the project is seri-
ous money and space problems.

Presently, the preferred site for
the Convocation Center is at the
northeast side of Pitt Stadium on
the “OC” Lot. The Center, which
would ultimately connect with
Pitt Stadium and all other athletic
facilities except the Cost Center,
is projected to have around 5,500
more seats than the Fitzgerald
Field House. Capacity for basket-
ball games will be somewhere
between 1 1,000-12,0()0.

But according to Jaynes, the
Convocation Center is much
more than a basketball arena.

ty like this. Not only will it recruit
athletes,-but it will deﬁnitely help
recruit students. I don’t think
there’s any more important need
than addressing the needs for stu-
dents.

“The Convocation Center
touches every student and faculty
member on campus. I think
there’s nothing more important
than a library and recreation facil-
ities. Students now are looking
for more than classrooms.”

According to Jaynes, not only
will the Center enhance students’
way of life, but it will free up the
other facilities like Trees Hall and
the Field House for intramural
and extracurricular activities.

However, Jaynes’ opinion isn’t
shared by everybody. Mary
McDonough, the coordinating
secretary and active member of

“I think taxpayers" money can
be used for something much,
much more important,”
McDonough said. “Pitt has

. tremendous. needs, and I don’t

know if this is one them. I think
the role of the university is to
educate.”

The Center will also be used
for graduation, concerts and other
activities. But Goodwin’ says con-
vocation needs can be fulfilled by
the Civic Arena and the'Center
won’t be in use much besides
basketball games, hence, it’s sirn—
ply a basketball arena. But the

state won’t provide funds for a ‘

basketball arena. It will, however,
fund a convocation center.
Besides the necessity of the
Center, parking and traffic ﬂow
seem to be the main concerns. It’s
documented that Western

Oakland (around the Hill District)
already has its share of parking
problems.'And with the addition
of 5,500 more seats, coupled with

the “OC” Lot being knocked out, 1

parking is sure to be more of a
problem.

“You already can’t move in .

Oakland,” Goodwin said.
“Where’s the logic? They’re
knocking out a parking lot, bring-
ing more people in. If you have a
problem, then address it, don’t
add to it”

But Jay Roling, the director of 2

community affairs, says situations
like parking can be handled.

“Most of the games are during
the evening,” he said, “and that
means the Presbyterian Hospital
parking lot is empty. But Western
Oakland is very concerned”

Still, the problem of uaﬁic ﬂow
remains. Jaynes says with the
Center being built, trafﬁc isn’t

going to change much.

According to Roling, he is tin-
kering with the idea of changing
trafﬁc patterns — for example,
prohibiting left turns from Forbes
onto Craft Avenue during speciﬁc

i hours.

“They’re not addressing those
issues,” Goodwin said. “You can
tell people they can turn here and
can’t tum there, but it’s not going
to help.”

While parking and traffic are
major concerns for West
Oakland, money is what’s hold-
ing the project down. Currently,
there are no architectural plans,

‘ no starting or finishing dates, no

certainty that the Center will be
built at all.

The state has allocated Pitt $13
million. The ballpark ﬁgure for
the cost of the Center is $42 mil-
lion. However, Penn State recent-
ly built a similar facility which
was in the range of $55 million.

There’s around a $30 million
difference that Pitt needs to come
up with. But according to Jaynes,
Penn State and Temple each
received about $30 million from
the state for their convocation
center. Jaynes is hopeful that the
state will allocate more. Until that
happens, Tom Hussey, the associ-

ate vice-chancellor for facilities

management and the designer
and builder of the Center, has to
sit on his hands until he gets the
go-ahead nod.

Although the Center will be a

costly project, the prospect of —

injecting more revenue into
Oakland is a positive one. Since
the seating capacity will be raised,
it would bring more people to the
Oakland area. Roling said that
1,800 more seats would be set
aside for students, and the
remaining 3,700 extra seats
would be for whoever wants to
pay.

“If you increase the number of
seats, the economic impact,
whether in restaurants or stores,
will definitely help,” Jaynes said.
“Most people in the neighbor-
hood are opposed to new people
coming in, but no question it will
bring the right kind of people.”

“I think it has some possibility

to bring in revenue,” McDonough

said.

Additionally, the Convocation
Center would help attract the top-
notch recruits. Head basketball
coach Ralph Willard says the
Center would push Pitt over the
hump as the university looks to
the future.

“Obviously, we had a great
recruiting class,” Willard said of

his 1995 class that’s  in the
nation’s top 10. “The Umversity
of Pittsburgh has tremendous pos-
sibilities. But recruiting at the top.
I think the Convocation Center
would put Pitt over the top.” _

“Go to any major university
and they have a convocation cen-
ter,” Jaynes said.

Not only would the Center lure
the top high school players in the
country, which would raise stu-
dent interest, but it would bring

 

big—time revenue to Pitt with all
the huge television contracts and
postseason invitations.

McDonough doesn’t see it that
way.

“It’s for bragging rights,” she
said. .

Despite all the controversies,
questions and problems, Jaynes
remains optimistic.

“I think it’s something that will
be built,” Jaynes said. “It’s some-
thing that’s a very critical part of
the University of Pittsburgh.”
