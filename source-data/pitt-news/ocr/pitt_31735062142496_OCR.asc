There is a Santa Claus. But he

He has an office on the ﬁrst floor

the Pitt student body as Chancel-

This year “Santa” Bowman
made sure that his students had
their Christmas trees. When he
learned that the scarcity of trees
was going to mean no trees for

several trees from his own farm.

become creative cooperators in the making of the world as
it is to be.

 A Prayer For Teachers And Students

It has been easier to tell our students about the motionless
past that we can learn once for all, than to join with them in
trying to understand the living present that must be studied
afresh each morning. From these sins of sloth may we be
freed. May we realize that it is important to know the past
only that we may live wisely in the present. Help us to be more
interested in stimulating the builders of modern cathedrals
than retailing to students the glories of ancient temples.

Give us to see that a student’s memory should be a tool
as well as a treasure chest. Help us to realize, in the deepest
sense, we cannot teach anybody anything; that the best we
can do_ is to help them to learn for themselves. Save us from
the blight of specialism; give us-reverence for our materials.
that we may master the facts of our particular fields, but
help us to see that all facts are dead until they are related
to the rest of the knowledge and to the rest of life. May we
know how to relate the “coal scuttle to the universe.”

Help us to see that education is, after all, but the adven-
ture of trying to make ourselves at home in the modern world.
May we_be shepherds of the spirit as well as masters of the
mind. Give us, 0 Lord of Learners, a sense of divinity of our
undertaking.——Glenn Frank.

Silverman Talks 

ln Philadelphia

In a lecture at Franklin Institute 
in Philadelphia last Wednesday 
evening, Dr. Alexander Silverman,”
head of the department of chemis,-I’:

try, cited the many uses of glass _

to date needed to win the war.

Dr. Silverman, who is recognized

as the foremost authority on glass’
in America today, explained the‘
uses to which glass is put in tanks,‘
liferaftsi,'

airplanes, automobiles,
insulations, photography, bearings:

in delicate instruments, and recent‘
developments inbending laminated,

plate glass.

“Every man and woman in the
service is equipped with a mirror
in his kit.” While one might not
think this is essential, said Dr. Sil-

verman, it is very necessary for ‘

morale. r

A new form of glass is foam
glass, a multi-cellular glass, which
islighter than water and thus may
be used in liferafts and life belts.

Its great advantage over the ordi- 1:
nary rubber and cork life preserv- -

ers is that it will not become water :
logged after many hours in the
water, as cork will, and will not 3
ﬁll with water and sink with only ‘A
a few bullet holes in it as rubber E

ﬂoats will.

Since Bob is writing the col-
umn today he won't be able to
announce his own pinning of
Ginny Sullivan, lovely TPA ac-
tive. The event happened last
‘Saturday night. A while back
Bob had mentioned that the war
was getting him down and that
he didn't care what happened.
However, he probably snapped
out of it Saturday night. (At
least she hopes).

Johnny Jenkins, one of the 47
club's smoother sophomores, got
hold of a bottle of Creosote last
week and really gave Delt Jack
Kelso the business. Every time
Jack would turn around he received
a few drops of the stuff in his
glass. Is that the way to improve
inter—fraternity relationships, John,
or did you think that Jack could
drink most anything and never
notice it?

The Delts have their Rumpus
room, the Phi Delts have their

Bum room, and now the Phi Kaps
have come up with their ace-in-the-

hole, the Blue room. However, only‘~

friends are permitted‘ to use it.

‘Pitt Can Be lustly Proud

Ol War Record to Date

Iy HARRIET ACKERMAN

When the “V” for victory be-
pomes more than‘ a sticker and
signiﬁes-the real thing. the Univer-
Iity of Pittsburgh will be able to
look back on its record with pride.

Today Pitt’s entire program is
devoted to furthering the war effort
Lon every front.

By inaugurating war courses
“for part-time students in cooper-
ation with the U. S. Office of Edu-
cation, Pitt has trained 15.922
students. 30 per cent of which are
women.

Over $20,8Q0 worth of stamps
‘and bonds have been sold by Pitt
students, surpassing the records of
any other college or university. To
':the United War Fund campaign

‘students and professors contributed
$13,600.

Another great contribution by
the university that cannot be
measured in dollars is the 694
pints of blood volunteered for the
Red Cross Blood Bank.

To keep ’em ﬂying, Pitt has
offered special aeronautic courses
for future pilots and ground crews
under the auspices of Civil Aeron-
autics Authority.

Women students and faculty
members have trained most will-
ingly for first aid classes that have
been offered periodically since Jan-
uary.

. Pitt’s greatest sacriﬁce has
been the 58 per cent of the alumni
men and women who are now
serving on all ﬁghting fronts, and
the 110 members of the faculty
on leave of absence to serve with
the armed forces. _

In the first year of World War
II, the University of Pittsburgh
has been mobilized.

he had “simple faith”

In Simple Faith

The shepherds saw a mid-
night sky
All bright and were dis-
mayed;
But, worshipping, they asked
not why
They worshipped unafraid.

The wise men by a star
were led
To Bethlehem and saw
The wonder-child; but no one
said,

“Why stand we here in’

awe?”

And we, in this strange time -

—l-ike them,
Not asking why it’s true——
Accept the spell of Bethle-
hem,
And courage comes anew;

For there are paths beyond

the mind,
Where reason never trods

In simple faith alone we find 

The help that comes from ;

God.’

ngineers Seek Hockey Return;
ittle Chance Seen For It Now

There is an investigation cur-
rently being carried on by one of
the committees of SFA into the
whys and wherefores of collegiate
hockey. It has been four years
since ice hockey disappeared from
the campus and if the student body
as a whole .hasn’t exactly clamored
for its return, at least the engi-
neers are quietly agitating. They
want it back. but on an intramural
basis.

One of their representatives pre-
sented the request to SFA and as
a result a committee was formed
to look into things. Their report
has not yet been made, but it
would seem unlikely that ice hockey
would, at this time, be again made
a part of the sports program.

Hockey is an expensive sport.
The equipment is costly and, while
water may be cheap, artiﬁcial ice
is not. The only place available for
play is the Garden ice, and hockey
on an intramural basis could not
hope to pay its way.

Pitt's ﬁrst Hockey was played
away back in 1909-10, but the
sport was dropped and did not
make a reappearance until 1916
and then it was a strictly minor
affair. It was not until 1938-39
that Pitt really had a hockey team.

They were members of the Penn-
sylvania-Ohio Hockey League. The
Pittsburgh members included Pitt,

Tech, and Duquesne, while Ohio
members included John Carroll,
Baden Wallace, Fenn, and Western
Reserve. The games were played
at Duquesne Garden where some
sort of a ﬁnancial arrangement ex-
isted with the owners whereby all
gate proceeds went to them, save
a certain small percentage allotted
to Pitt.

From a student standpoint, the
games were huge successes. Hockey
is one of the most popular spec-
tator games. It is fast and furious
and the students were not lacking

in appreciation, for they generally
packed the Gardens.

But at the close of the 1939 sea-
son Hockey was again dropped.
Various reasons were given, chief
of which was that it was too rough.
However, probably the actual rea-
son, although one that was never
officially given, concerned Pitt's
relations with Duquesne, for Pitt
could hardly agree to play D11-

qucsne in hockey while refusing to‘ '

play them in other sports. In any
event, hockey disappeared from
the sports schedule.

ny ELAINE KAIIN

In recent years no respectable
football team has been able to call
its season completed until all the
more revealing minutia, otherwise
known as statistics. has been bared

for public inspection. These statis-
tics have always been redoubtable,
impressive, and accurate. especial-
ly accurate.

However. this year’s statistics
will be different, the- difference
being that we added them up.
From here on in this essay will be
devoted to proving that ﬁgures
can lie . . . if we ﬁgure them.
That two and two make four is a
fact we spout only from memory,
having never been quite able to
prove it.

However we bravely tackled .the
mass of ﬁgures representing the
individual game totals of the
players.

We began with Dutton. The ﬁrst
time we added his total number of
yards gained the sum resembled the
National Debt. Dutton did place
third in the nation for ground
gaining honors, but our ﬁgure indi-
cated that he had not only spent 60
minutes of every game running up
and down the gridiron, but that he
had also run cross country, and
accompanied Willkie on his world
tour.

The second time we added the
ﬁgures, the total came down some-
what. This time it only resembled
the war debt. It wasabout this time

we decided to enlist the aid of an
adding machine. To date we claim
to be the only person who can use
an adding machine to produce the
fact that 235 minus 29 leaves a total
gain of 291 yards!

But in spite of us, the ﬁgures
show Bill Dutton to have wound
up with a total oﬁense mark of
1285 yards. He gained 675 yards
rushing and 610 yards passing.
Hoot Flannigan still holds the
Pitt record for most pass comple-

tions per season with 30. but Dut-
ton came pretty close with 26.
He broke Heller’s record for most
yardage gained per game'by gar-
nering 308 yards in the Ohio
State game. Heller’s record was
287.

Only other member of the Pitt
team to run up record signiﬁcant
yardage was Frank Saksa who
gained 114 yards on punt returns
in the Penn State game. He did not
break any of the Pitt records.

The ﬁnal statistics of the season
are about what you would expect.
(Carver added these up and they
are correct.) Pitt had a total of
1820 yards gained, while 2804
yards were run up against them. It
was a bad season and the ﬁgures
don’t make it look any better. They
only make it look worse.

Latest Player To Enlist

With Anthony “Primo” DiMat-
teo’s entrance into the air cadets,
Pitt’s 1943 football team loses one
of its most valuable prospects.
DiMatteo was well on his way to
being one of Pitt’s backﬁeld greats,
but now all his running will have
to be for Uncle Sam.

He graduated from Perry High
School in 1940 and was voted the
Most Valuable gridder from that
school by one of the local papers.

A sudden change in the Pitt line-
up for the Minnesota game brought
“Primo” into the limelight this
year, for it was he who grabbed
the kickoff following Bill Daley’s
touchdown and raced 98 yards for
a Pitt touchdown that, for just
about ﬁve minutes, tied the score
with Minnesota, which was as
close as Pitt has been able to get
to Minnesota since they began foot-
ball relations.

Unfortunately, DiMatteo re-
ported to the pre-season practice
sessions this year with a pulled
muscle in his leg and this injury
held him back all season.

He played at the wingback posi-
tion in a few games but the leg
injury did not permit him to stick
it out. Although it was he who
sparked his teammates to victory
in the Carnegie Tech contest, at
best he couldonly play off and on.

In fact, during the last ﬁve
weeks of practice he participated
in none of the more strenuous ses-
sions. And it is believed that an
operation may be necessary to

bring the leg around in good shape .

again.

DiMatteo was a good defensive
back and under normal times and
minus the injury might have had
an extraordinary instead of mere-
ly a good year. He was deceptively
small in appearance, although he
weighed 190 pounds and possessed
strong legs that made him an ex-
cellent runner.

With his enlistment into the Air
Cadets, DiMatteo joins a score of
his teammates who are already
enlisted in branches of the service.
Among those already in the en-
listed reserves are Mike Sotack,
Chick Gestner, Jack Durisham,
Jim Mariades, Jim Clowes, Joe
Costella, and Carlacinni. None of
these players has been called up
for active service as yet, but with
the new draft regulations it is ex-
tremely likely that many of the
boys will be leaving in February

or March and extremely unlikely
that they will be around when the
next football season rolls around.

This, of course, brings up the
question as to whether there is
going to be any football next year.

The schedule has already been an-'

nounced, but schedules are made
up several years in advance, and

hence this has little bearing on the

future of Pitt football.

But one thing is clear. You can,
maybe, get around the transporta-
tion problem by taking street cars
and buses, but there is absolutely
no substitute for a football player.
