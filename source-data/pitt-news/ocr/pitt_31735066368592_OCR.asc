The Student Government Board
is angered over the proposed closing
of the Internship office and is inves-
tigating ways to prevent its closing.

“The SGB has come to the conclu-
sion that the closing of the office is a
big injustice to the students at Pitt,”
President Mark Downs said. “Even-
tually, the admjnistration is placing
the Internship Office at a low prior-
ity, and what they intend to do is
eliminate the program.

“I knew the Internship Office had
been facing cuts year after year, but
the proposed closing caught me
completely by surprise." Downs said
that the administrations had not
informed him at all—he learned of
the closing through The Pitt News.

It is an important issue to the
SGB, Downs said. “We feel that the

Internship Office provides a unique
opportunity for students to gain
work experience in their chosen
fields.”

Nancy Denhart, director of thc
Internship Office, said in the event
that the Internship office is closed,
there are three possible solutions-
all three are unacceptable to the
SGB.

The first solution would be to give
the responsibilities of the Intership
Office to the Advising Center in the
Cathedral, Downs said,
though the Advising Center has
already been reduced drastically and
the advisors overloaded."

Another solution would be to dis-
tribute the Internship Office respon-
sibilities to the various departments.
That would mean if a student
wanted an internship in economics.

“even

he would have to go to the econom-
ics department.

“I don't think that it will work
because the Internship Office is now
centrally located——without a cen-
tralized location students may not
know where to go or that internships
in their ﬁeld even exist," Downs
said.

The third alternative‘ would be to
give the responsibilities of the office
to the Placement Center.

A According to Denhart, the place-

ment staff is already overloaded.

Alsothe internships WOUIQ take on
the appearance ofjobs—which they
are not. Internships are a way of
getting experience while earning
credits, Denhart said.

Data compiled by the Registrar’s
Office and the Faculty of Arts and

SGB Tackles Internship Closing  

Sciences shows that 725 students
applied for internships this year.
This figure does not include students
who visited the office for informa-
tion, resume and application assist-
ance and registration forms.

This year, 200 students registered
for 555 credits through the office. In
terms of tuition, the university
received $40,5l5 from these
students.

Originally, the Internship Office
was funded by a federal grant of
$35,000. The grant had certain
guidelines that had to be followed--
that students who accepted an
internship had to spend two terms
away from school (out of four years
undergrad). The federal grant
money was lost some time ago. Pres-
ently, it costs $20,000 a year to run
the Internship Office.

Coretta Scott KingTo Speak At Pitt

By PEGGY FERRI

Coretta Scott King, considered by
many to be a leading spokesman for
minorities, will be speaking at a lec-
ture entitled “The Living Legacy of

Martin Luther King, Jr.”tomorrow 

night at David Lawrence Audito-
rium. She is expected to speak about
the changing roles of both women
and minorities.

King has also recently been
selected by The Truman Award
Commission to receive the Harry S.
Truman Public Service Award. She
will share the award with her late
husband. The award is presented to
an outstanding public figure.

Despite her prominence, only 200
student tickets have been distributed
so far. The Pitt Program Council
(PPC), sponsor ofthe lecture, will be
making attempts to promote the lec-
ture one more time before the event,
according to PPC lecture chairper-
son Al Frioni.

“I'm bafﬂed by it," he said. He
added that distribution of the
tickets, free with a student l.D.. usu-
ally picks up at the door.

King was chosen by the PPC
because of her reputation and her
activities, which include founding
the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center
for Nonviolent Social Change,
located in Atlanta, Georgia.

Under King’s direct leadership,
the center promotes the concept of
nonviolcnce through seminars,
workshops and institutes for
teachers and community leaders.

Former PPC lecture chairperson
Elizabeth Barnett cited other rea-
sons for the selection.

“We chose her to fulfill part of our
constitution [presenting minority
programs] and because she is a defi-
nite leader," Barnett explained. “She
brings a great deal of prominence
with her, and she appeals to both the
black and white audience.”

The total cost of King's speaking
engagement has not yet been deter-
mined, she added.

King is sought continuously as a
speaker and lecturer. and she has
travelled extensively throughout the
world. Her book. “My Life With
Martin Luther King, Jr.” was a
major best seller and was translated
into 16 languages.

She is not on a lecture tour,
according to Barnett. King, instead,
does a few speaking engagements.

Her fame means that she must be
protected. The PPC, according to
Barnett, has arranged to have a
security guard accompany King

Thaw Hall: Part of Pitt’s Past

By MARY ANN KRUPA

. Behind the name of every building
at Pitt is a story of either a famous
alumnus, a revered former professor
or wealthy and powerful philanthro-
pist who donated a share of his for-
tune to the university.

The city of Pittsburgh was once a
breeding ground for rich and
inﬂuential individuals who amassed
their fortunes on the steel, coal, and
railroad industries that sprang up
along the banks of the three rivers.
Names like Mellon, Scaife, Carne-
gie, Hillman and Jones have found
their way to cornerstones of librar-
ies, museums and classroom build-

 

ings all over the university.

Many of these individuals
brought something more than their
wealth to the University of Pitts-
burgh, however, and Thaw Hall was
named for a man whose generosity
was matched by his dedication to the
progress of education.

Thaw Hall was the second build-
ing to be erected on the Oakland
campus of the university after it
moved from the downtown area to
officially become the University of
Pittsburgh, formerly known as the
Western University of Pennsyvania.

The cornerstone for Thaw Hall
was, in fact, laid on the same day
that the mines building, State Hall,

Photo courtesy of the University Archives

was opened up for inspection on
June 9, i909 and the same" day that
ground was broken for the medical
building, Pennsylvania Hall.

In September of that year, Thaw
Hall was occupied by the universi-
ty’s school of engineering, which
represented a large portion of the
university’s students at that time.

William Thaw, Sr. was the man
who headed the family that made
this building, and other important
additions to the university, possible.
His son, Benjamin Thaw, had given
a substantial amount of money
toward the erection of the structure
in order to honor the memory of his
father, who had spent a good deal of

his lifetime shoring up the prestige of .

Pitt.

Thaw, Sr. who was born in l8l8
and died in 1889, was one ofthe first
of the Pittsburgh philanthropists to
support Pitt when it was then the
Western University of Pennsylvania

and to take an active interest in mak- a

ing Pittsburgh an educational
center.

Together with his brother—in-law, _

Thomas S. Clarke, he owned and
operated a group of steamboat lines,
notably the Cincinnati and_ Packet
Line. In 1857, the partners took
charge of the freight business west of
Pittsburgh. Thaw, Sr. was responsi-
ble for devising the first through-

train system, and for the last eight ‘

years of his life, was director of the
Pennsylvania Railroad.

Thaw, Sr. had l0 children who,
upon his death, continued to make
valuable and generous donations to
the university in his honor. One of
these gifts was the Thaw telescope,
which was placed under the great
dome of the Allegheny Observatory
in 1912. The telescope was, for its
time, the most efficient and com-
plete instrument that the Observa-
tory had ever possessed. It helped to
make Allegheny Observatory a
leader in the world in the determina-
tion of interstellar distances.

Thaw and his son had long been
serious supporters of the work of
Samuel Pierpont Langley and
James Edward Keeler, former direc-
tors of the observatory and pioneers
in the field of astronomical research.

But the Thaw family, and the
Thaw name, was blemished by scan-
dal in 1906. For many Pittsburghers,
the name Thaw elicits memories of
one of the most sensational trials in
the history of the U.S.

One of William Thaw‘s sons,
Harry Kendall Thaw, married a
beautiful chorus girl and artist’s
model named Evelyn Nesbit in Pitts-
burgh’s Third‘ Presbyterian Church
in 1905.

Nesbit had been the former inti-
mate of celebrated architect Stan-
ford White and actor John
Barrymore.

On June 26, 1906, 34-year-old
Harry Thaw and his wife attended
the opening of “Mamelle Cham-
pagne" in New York’s Madison
Square Garden Theatre, which was
built by Stanford White.

When Thaw discovered that
White, his wife’s former lover, was in
the audience that night, he left his
table, took out his revolver and shot
the architect point-blank—killing
him instantly.

The itrialithat followed became i

one of the most sensational news
items of the day, for it was the first
time that sex had ever been dis-
cussed in an open court.

On the stand, Nesbit related that
rumors had been spread about Thaw
and his proclivity for sexual sadism,
but she claimed they were false.

Harry Thaw’s mother engaged the
lawyer Delphin Michael Delmas of
San Fransisco for a reported fee of
$100,000 to defend her son. Delmas
tried to prove that Thaw had been
insane when he shot White, but
Thaw issued a statement to the effect

that he was not crazy and was “glad‘*

he did it.”

'l‘haw’s defense was successful,
and he was committed to the institu-
tion for the criminally insane at
Mattawan.

ln l9 l 5, he was retried and acquit-
ted of all charges. On his return to
Pittsburgh, he was given a hero's
welcome by 1,000 people, who
escorted him to his mother’s home.

He was out of the limelight until a
few years later when a suit charging
him with the whipping of a young
boy in a Philadelphia hotel room
was settled out of court. He died in

Miami in 1947 at the age of 76.

Hand-in-HandFestival
Features Franco Harris

The fifth annual Hand-in-Hand
Festival for 'Pittsburgh’s handi-
capped children will take place in
Forbes Quadrangle this Saturday.

The “special guest” of this year's

‘ festival will be Franco Harris, a run-

ning back for the Pittsburgh
Steelers.

“The kids will be able to readily
identify with him,” Lisa Shumaker,
the festival coordinator said. “He is
very receptive to children and will be
an added highlight of the festival.”

According Shumaker, the day
promises to be as exciting as ever.

“Definitely, without a doubt, we
are as well organized—-if not more—
as ever for the festival,” Shumaker

' said.
One major difference between this .

year's festival is in the age limit of
handicapped children. In past festi-
vals, no age limit was enforced; 60-
and 80-year-old exceptional
individuals participated.

The older individuals—older than
most of the student volunteers— did
not, according to festival personnel,
facilitate a learning atmosphere,
which is one of the festival’s main
purposes. Thus, the festival staff

voted in November to instate an age _

limit of 21 years or younger for this
year's festival.

“I think it will be more educa-
tional and more enjoyable with
younger children,” Shumaker said.
“The age of the children coming to
this year’s festival ranges anywhere
from 8 to 21, but the average age is
around 8 or 9.”

Other special guests of the 1983
Hand-in-Hand Festival include the
Pirate Parrot, the McDonaldland
Grimace and Sparky the Fire Dog.

The festival will also feature a var-
iety of events throughout the day.
Two bands that sing in sign
language——Breakthrough and Beau-
tiful Hands—along with the Nursing
Student Organization and Delta
Delta sorority will stage acts.

What makes the day special for
the children are the student organi-
zations’ booths. Occupational thera-
pists’ “Pencil People,” the varsity
computer operators’ “Terminal
Games” and pharmacy students’
“Beat the Goalie” are just a few of
the 40 festival booth’s‘.

And what’s a festival without
prizes?

The Hand-in-Hand Festival staff
has been seeking out prizes all year
for the student booths to award.
Some of the prizes include a sand-
box play center, Gateway Clipper
passes, a radio and a score of stuffed
animals. ,

Lunch for both the student volun-
teers and children is provided. the
lunch buffet will consist of McDon-
ald’s hamburgers, Superior and
Armor hot dogs, cookies and ice
cream.

Three-hundred and fifty excep-
tional childrenfrom over 30 institu-
tions will be in attendance. Each
child will be paired with a student
volunteer—an activity in which
there “has been a tremendous
response.”

Medical personnel will be present
to ensure the children’s and students’
safety.

The festival will take place from
ll a.m.-4 p.m. Student volunteers
will report at l0 a.m., and booth
personnel and clowns at 9:30 a.m.

Pitt Seeking Student Input

(r)rIl1rIz(r(/_frr))ii ;)ag:(' ())IP

The only disadvantage to
owning your own system,” said
Bardsley, “is that the students
would be responsible for the
security and maintenance of the
system.”

However, this ownership
provides the student with
complete control of the system,
enabling him to take the system
home or use it for games and
other work.

On the other hand, if students
prefer to pay a standard fee for
the use of a superb university
computer system, Bardsley said
he estimates the cost to be about
$75 per term.

The disadvantage to this type
of system is that the student
wou-ld only be permitted access
through public terminals and
only during school terms.

The task force has made

progress in its attempt to‘

increase the amount of available
space for the terminals. Within
the next 18 months, Bardsley
expects the present space to
double, which would meet the
univeristy’s present de.nand.

“However,” he explained, “we
will need at least five times that
space to accommodate future
demands.” «‘

0 Should the university
implement an introductory
computer course in its
curriculum, and should that
course be required for all

students or simply available to _

'them? This question arises, he
said, because right now, between

one-third and one-half of the
student body is enrolled in some
type of computer course.

0 How would the students feel
about the implementation of a
computer-controlled mailing
system? Do they think it would
be beneficial‘?

“Such a system wouldenable
students to exchange messages
between each other without
having to use the postal service,”
Bardsley said. It would also
enable facutly and students to
not only exchange messages, but
to collaborate on homework
assignments, set up office
appointments and exchange
questions.

Such a system is available
.now, but at the present, it is not
accessible to many individuals.

Bardsley said he is planning to
distribute a document
containing a list of all questions
relevant to students to the entire
student body in the very near
future.

Pitt physics professor and co-
chairman of the Senate
Computer Usage Committee,
Paul Sheppard, is collecting
documents assessing the present
needs of the university for a
computer system and the
capabilities needed of a system in
the future.

Previously, Sheppard had
asked potential computer users

in all areas of the university—
including the medical school,
dental school and College of
General Studies—to think of all



possible uses for a computer
system in their department and
from them prepare a written
document to be returned to him.

The documents are now
beginning to arrive on his desk
and he said he expects them all to
be collected by the end of the
month.

“The next step in the process is
to organize the documents and
put together a picture of the
future (computer) needs at the
University of Pittsburgh,”-
Sheppard said. He said he hopes
to have a preliminary evaluation
prepared by the end of April.

Sheppard expects to see a
picture of a network ofcomputer
facilities at the university,
because that is the direction
computer technology seems to be
going. It is also a realistic way to
meet the needs of the entire
university.”

Bardsley said he would
welcome all student and faculty
suggestions. A forum on April 5
at Thaw Hall has been designed
for all potential users of the
computer system to be installed.

“Montgomery would be

65

perfectly happy to have any“

interested students join his
committee since it has not begun
working yet,” Bardsley said. The
main goal of the task force is to
get more students involved in its
efforts.

 Part-Timestudents Having Financial Problems

9





ft

La .............

Due to cutbacks in funding, many
college students are feeling the pres-
sure of obtaining aid for school.
Part-time students, especially, are
feeling this pressure.

“There has been a tightening-up
of policy by the federal government

in regard to continuing eligibility for ,

various forms of financial aid,”

lrwin Schulman, dean ofthe College,

of Arts and Sciences (CAS), said.

A new financial aid policy has
been instated recently which is more
stringent than the one in years past.
In order to qualify for financial aid,
a student must have completed at
least a minimum of 24 credits and

have maintained an acceptable
QPA.
“There will be a significant

number of students: who will be
caught by that standard and forced
out of school.” Schulman said.

Schulman said that it is difficult to
estimate what impact this new policy
will have. However, one effect it has
had this year is the reversal of the
trend of students’gaing on part-time
status. Under I0 percent of the stu-
dents are presently classified under
part-time status, a smaller percen-
tage than last year, he said.

“One way to account for this is
that the new policies on ﬁnancial aid
really penalize the student who
might wish to drop back from full-

‘time to part-time,” Schulman said.

“This jeopardizes his chances of
receiving aid in the future."

Schulman however, noted that
theirassumption may be incorrectw
that the reason there are less part-
time students is that it may be harder
to find part—time jobs or students
may rea.li7.e that it is to their best
benefit to go straight through four
years of college.

The lack of part-time" aid is
decreasing the enrollment not only
at Pitt, but at other schools also.

“It may be that people are going to
community colleges who might oth-
erwise be going to Pitt—just as we
are now getting students who are
coming to Pitt who might otherwise
be going to private schools,” Schul-
man said.

Schulman said that the difference
between Pitt and a community col-
lege is not as great as Pitt and a
private school (such as Carnegie-
Mellon University). “I don‘t really

see us losing that. great ofa number .
of potential applicants,” he said.

“I sympathize with the federal
government. If the federal govern-
ment is putting up the taxpayer’s
money to go to college that is a kind
of contract saying ‘in exchange for
my being a serious student, I will

remain eligible for continung finan- rt

cial aid,’ " Schulman explained; “If
the student does not fulfill his end of
the deal, then we have a right to cut
his aid."

Laugh
ltUp

‘ . Films about the adventurous, sometimes

mischievous, sometimes illegal, exploits of
college students are surely never made at Pitt.

Not only don’t we run around wearing
nothing but shaving cream——1ike students on
the coast—but we hardly ever move our
roommate’s bed into the hall. Into the show-
ers, sometimes, but never the hall.

Where is Pitt’s senseof humor‘? lt’s surely
not found scrawled on the walls. In place of
pearls like, “Why do Pitt administrators wear
high platform shoes...?” we have chalked
advertisements for the latest long-haired
friend of Jesus to come to Oakland.

There’s no humor in Pitt’s Greek “chariot
races”——a tough competition between the
sleekest brass beds in Pittsburgh——either.
Now we have campus police on hand, not to
break up the brouhaha, but to keep unsus-
pecting cars from interfering.

Where is Pitt’s sense of humor‘! is it
drowned by an overdose of grey stone walls?
Maybe it can’t find a place to park. Or per-
haps it’s been traded away for the grit it takes
to contribute 40 percent of the cost of a col-
lege education.

Certainly times are tough, but that's no
excuse for forgetting how to laugh. After all,

. even with inflation, how much can shaving
cream cost? How much extra effort would it

take to move that bed into the hall tonight?

How hard, finally, can it be to figure out
why Pitt administrators wear high platform-
shoes? It only takes one piece of chalk, one
sidewalk. Wouldn’t it be worth it to let the
world know that the reason is so their knuck-
les don’t scrape the floor when they walk?

Letters To The Editor
Waiting ForA Leader

Dear Editor:

I would like to respond to an edi-
torial reply which appeared in the
March 2l, 1983, issue entitled “Law
of the Land.” in that letter, an
unknown author made several
incorrect statements. I would like to
clarify them.

The Solomon Amendment did
propose that male college students
show proof of registering for the
draft before they can receive finan-
cial aid. The question concerning the
“student activists” is not whether the
draft should be mandatory but,
rather, if theamendment violates
students rights. I believe it does.

First, as a law it discriminates
against lower-income male college
students who are eligible for draft
registration, since they are the only
ones it affects.

Second, this law assumes that we
are guilty until proven innocent.
Students are forced to show proof of
registration before they can go to

school. lsn’t this America, where we
are innocent until proven otherwise?

Third, the law is a blatant act of
harassment against the 98 percent of
the registered draft-aged males in
college. While the government con-
tinues its witch hunt for the ellusive 2
percent who failed to follow the law,
they are also in the process of caus-
ing immense administrative
headaches.

We can expect to see many mis-
placed letters of certification, many
interrupted college careers and
many ruined lives due to minor
administrative snafus. Fourth, just
weeks ago a state supreme court
ruled the Solomon Amendment
unconstitutional, on the grounds
that it violates the individuals right
of being free of self-incrimination.

I am not trying to say whether
draft registration is wrong or right,
but I am saying the process that it’s
being used to weed out violators is
wrong.

While attending a student aid con-
ference in Washington earlier in the

Following God ’s

Dear Editor:

I would like to contend with some
of the statements made by clergywo-
man Chaffee concerning Christian
sexual standards in “The inside
Story" this past Wednesday.

Chaffee says she believes that due
to changes in society, the number of
singles, etc., the church needs to
respond by encouraging positive
attitudes toward whatever sexual
lifestyles people choose. Concerning
living together, she states,"‘lt is not
the ideal. perhaps, but I would never
say it is sinful.”

Chaffee makes a valid point in
saying that it's hard to maintain a
standard of confining sexual rela-
tions to marriage in today's world.
However. to say that this makes liv-
ing together acceptable is wrong.

The New Testament repeatedly
says that immorality(sex outside the
context of marriage) is sin. in fact, it
singles out immorality. saying. “Flee
immorality. Every other sin that a
man commits is outside the body.
but the immoral man sins against his
own body.” I Cor. o:l8 (NASB)

To say that living together outside
marriage is permissible in the church
is not a mere compromise of tradi-
tion. lt is a direct contradiction of
God's word. immorality will always
be a sin in God’s eyes. The response
of the church must be to adhere to
what the Bible says is true.

month, i met with members of stu-
dent delegations from across the
country. They all spoke about the
great accomplishments they have
achieved with regards to lobbying
their state legislatures as well as
within their own campus.

After listening for three days to
storiesof how marvelous “our" stu-
dents are, I began to wonder if the
reason Pitt students don’t get
involved is apathy, just as the
unknown author stated in his letter.
I realize however that it is not apathy
that stops students from organizing
against tuition hikes or restrictive
alcohol policies but rather lack of
student leadership—-only one SGB
member attended the student aid
rally in Washington, which was
funded in cooperation with the Pro-
gressive Student Network and SGB.

i believe the students here at Pitt
are willing to work for what is
important, however they cannot
achieve anything until leadership
emerges.

Plan

Christians were never called to
change their standards to “fit in"
with the world around them. God's
plan, as always, is best for all of us,
and Christians should follow it
regardless of what others do.

Warped Thinking

Dear Editor:

I greatly enjoyed the Inside Story
dealing with sex on campus. The
“Sex and Sinning"fcature. however.
did disturb me.

Both the .lewish and Catholic
faiths condemn sex unless it leads to
new life‘. somehow. this warped
thinking places us on the level of

animals.

As far as we know. man is the only
animal (other than some types of
monkeys) who enjoys sex for the
pleasure derived from it. The
churches seem to be saying that man
should engage in sexual activity in
order to procreate (that is. breed).
What it pity if this is their thinking
since there is so much more to inti-
macy than adding one to one and
coming up with three.

In a far corner ofthe fourth ﬂoor ofthe
library, a lone figure sat hunched over an
open book.

“Yellow,” he giggled, “pretty yellow.”

The fat yellow highlighter glided
effortlessly across the pages, line by line.
It made little squeaking noises as it
started and stopped. His long and bony
fingers trembled slightly as he dragged it
across each word. A strange expression
drifted overthis features, as he bent ever
closer to the table. He sat up.

_ “Yellow...it must all become yellow,"
he croaked with resolve.

His highlighting suddenly took on a
new urgency. Line after line fell under the
tip of his marker. Ten minutes later, the
entire book had been neatly painted a
lovely shade of ﬂourescent yellow. He
closed the book, bringing the cover into
full view. It read, “Greater Pittsburgh
White Pages.”

“Not anymore,” he snickered to him-
self in glee.

Slowly he stood up and
around, his eyes growing wide.

“Don't bejealous,” he whispered to the
remaining thousands ofshelved volumes,
“you can be yellow too!”

He stifﬂy walked over to the nearest
shelf and began to apply his pen to the
pristine pages of the other books. One by
one he tossed them to the floor, painted
completely yellow.

“London bridge is falling down, falling
down, falling down...” he hummed mer-
rily to himself, “Wooowooo! Choo Choo
Choo Choo!”

“Shhhhhh!” hissed the other patrons.

“It’s all yellow! Turning yellow, I’m
yellow too!” sang the man as he picked

his nose and did a dance.

“He‘s nuts. Call the police,“ cautiously
whispered a girl with enormous dark cir-
cles under her eyes.

“I love rock and roll, so put another
dime in thejuke-box babyyyyy!”

“Help us for crissakes,” mumbled the
pudgy librarian into the phone, “before
he gets violent.”

“I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy!”

“Wait till I tell the guys back at the
house about this one,” mused a stocky
youth in a blue alligator shirt, “Hey
buddy! Wasamatter, you gone bananas
or something?"

“Yes, we have no bananas, we have no
bananas today!" screamed the man as he
began to eat the nearest volume of The
Federal Reserve Bulletin.

Just then, a sigh of reliefand anticipa-
tion rose from the crowd of students that
had gathered around the stack, as two
police officers in blue walked in. They
hurriedly strode up to the man, wrestled
the marker from his clenched fist, and
gently but firmly subdued him. (“Snap,”
went the handcuffs.) One of the police-
men unclipped the radio from his belt
and pressed the “talk” button.

“This is officer Smith reporting, we
have apprehended and subdued a student

“ I0-4 Officer Smith, what is the nature
of the disturbance? Over.”

“Oh, hello Mable. Listen—you’d bet-
ter call the boys at Western Psych. for

‘yellow fever’. Over.”

“Oh no, not another one. That makes

“Finals.”

lt’s a nice sunny day in March, sometime
in the not too distant future. Two full-
fledged engineers, off for a visit back to their
old college haunts, sit around with a beer
and talk about things in the way that only
engineers can.

“Seems like it should be Engineer's Week
around here,” Bob says.

“Too bad Pitt's School of Engineering
went downhill after we graduated,” Ray
replies.

“The School of Engineering got a lot of
bad press after Benedum Hall cracked in
half that one day.”

“Whole school faculty looked silly—a
building for engineers built on ground that
had been tunnelled under. ‘Imagine how
Dean Williams had to explain that one to
whattzis name—you know, Bob.”

“The guy who succeded ol’ Wes? I think
his name’s Freeman.”

“That guy really inherited a mess,” Ray
said.

“Really. The Schenley Hall, er, I mean,

the Pitt Union renovation scandal, the med .

school losing its accreditation...”

“Not to mention the great computer cen-
ter crash—all five Pitt timesharin_g compu-
ters downor two weeks before final exams.”

“You can't really fault the man for that.”

“What do you mean? Hell, back in 1983,

there were only two graphics terminals for
the whole campus. Up at Rennselaer Poly-
technic back then, they had 36 of them avail-
able 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Every
engineering school I can think of had its
freshmen. writing computer-graphics
programs." .

Bob takes a deep swig of his beer.

“Nobody at this university seemed to real-

ize how big computers and the graphics that

go with them were going to get; No one here
back then seemed to feel that pictures could
explain things and help to drive points
across better than a textbook. Not only that,
it wasn’t only the computer center that
screwed up. I remember a buddy of mine
who wrote for The Pitt News. They pai'd
$85,000 for a microcomputer system that‘
had five terminals.” '

“Wasn’t that when Apple II’s cost $2,500
each?” Ray asked.

“Sure was.” -

“They were screwed on that deal.”

“It was part of that scandal."

“My tuition dollars at work," Ray said.

“Things didn’t change much after we
left-—it’s still easy to spend other people's
tuition money.” \

“Let’s go have another beer.”

“Best idea you’ve had all day, Ray.”

Athletics. How important are they to a
university? _

This question has appeared in various
forms on the pages of newspapers and maga-
zines and on T.V. over the past few months.

Here at Pitt, topics heavily debated
include the amount of money allotted for the
athletics department and its effect on
budgets for academic programs, the alleged
special privileges athletes get and reﬂection
of athletes‘ social behavior on the university.

Students around campus were asked,
“How important is athletics to the univer-
sity?" Many of the students questioned
viewed athletics in a favorable light, but
there were some negative comments.

Criminology major Jim Sweeney said,
“Without athletics, a lot of university func-
tions wouldn‘t happen because it pulls in a
lot of money. Idon’t think a university could
survive without an athletics department.
Not one as big as this.”

Lisa Vigliotti. a sophomore economic
major. also said she thinks athletics is impor-
tant because of the revenues it generates for
the university. “Football games are a,big

help forstudent morale,”shc added. “A high
student morale is beneficial to the
university.” '

One Pitt female said, “I think it is impor-
tant. You must have a social side to college. I
think Pitt athletics get carried away a little
bit.” She went on to explain by saying that
she thinks the athletic department has
lenient behavior rules and the athletes have
too many privileges.

“Very important. ‘They have such good
athletes here,” freshman Tara Bullock said.
She added, “The athletic programs seem to
come before other programs.”

Junior economics major Lisa Spears also
said that athletics is important at Pitt and_ it
may even be more important than academ-
ics. She went on to say that athletics is one
reason Pitt is a prestigious university. Spears
also said that the athletic teams, especially
football, are a major reason students choose
to attend Pitt.

“I think it’s very important because it
brings in money and gives people a chance to
look at the academic curriculum as well,”
said Michael W. Bar, 21 former Pitt student
who is now in the Navy, referring to the

short academic “plugs" during halftime that
are shown on national television.

Freshman Andrea Keller said athletics is
important for promoting school spirit. “If
you have more school spirit, you’re more
likely to enjoy the other aspects of school,"
she said. “[Athletics] provides something
different todo besides study, not only for the
players, but for the other students who
watch.”

Mark Gardner, a student in the Graduate
School of Public and International Affairs,
said athletics is important for the students
who participate because it gives them
encouragement and a “valuable experience."
and for the university because it gives Pitt
more national exposure.

“There is the problem of funding, and
what sort of priority athletics si'ioti.‘d get as
opposed to academics," Gardner said. He
also cited the few problems concerning the
behavior of certain athletes but said these
problems are not a reflection on the adminis-
tration or coaches. He said thcsc“problcms"
are not problems but rather a few isolated
incidents. “It [athletics] does have value, but

“I think it's important because it’s a
release from all the studying and mental
work tha_t goes into college,"senior Bill King
said. ‘‘I guess it makes money, but I never
really thought about it.”

Bruce Michelson, a sophomore mechani-
cal engineering student, said that athletics
generates a lot of finances for the university
and helps make a name for Pitt. Having a
name helps to recruit new students.

“It also gives athletes a chance to go to
school and get an education while doing
what they are best at,” Michelson said.

“I think it provides an outlet for students
from everyday problems,” Sondra Balouris,
a sophomore majoring in exercise science,
said. “It’s a release from pressures that tend
to be overbearing at times."

Halouris added that all of the teams
should be given equal attention and one
sport should not receive special attention
because it brings in more money. She also
said she believes there should be strict
enforcement of grade requirements before
students are allowed to participate in a given

' Ten talents from the surrounding

' “Coming On,” is a show that is a

The one-hour show ‘will be aired

in June on Disney Cable Network‘

(available to the Pittsburgh area

Pitt Students ‘Coming On’

Production executive of the Dis-
ney Cable Network Marlene Daly
explained that the DCN is geared
toward family entertainment.

“A national survey was taken, and

- statistics showed, hands down," she

said, “that people are tired of dirty
movies. Families are going back to
families.”

“Coming On” is hosted by stand-
up comedian and actor Jimmy
Aleck. Aleck has appeared on “The
Tonight Show” and was only the
second person in the history on “The
Tonight Show," after Freddie
Prince, who was asked to sit and talk
to Carson after his act.

Co-hosting the University of
Pittsburgh series with Jimmy Aleck
was Pitt All-America quarterback
Dan Marino. In additiond to prais-
ing the talent found here in Pitts-
burgh, Aleck joked ‘‘I’m used to
having cheerleaders co—host with
me—they’re much more prettier to
look at. l also had a ventriloquist
dummy as a co-host—it was much
brighter than Marino.”

“I am pleased to have been
selected to co-host with Jimmy
Aleck,” Marino said. He and all
associated with the production are
great. Since I am a communications
major, this was a great experience.’

One performer, Leland Gantt,
who sang to selections from the mus-
ical “Pippin,” said, “Although I am ,
not new to the business, this is my
first big break with a national cable
TV situation.”

David Negy, a 1975 Duquense
graduate who did a classical-comedy
piano piece with a banana, agreed
with Gantt. “This is a great chance
for national recognition.”

All of the performers were from
outside the campus community and
heard about the auditions through
press coverage, with the exception of

more biology major, was the piano
accompanist for Leland Gantt and
one other act.

AUSTIN, Texas—- A A Texas House Appropriations Committee has filed a
bill that would allow Texas state universities and colleges to create a foreign
student services fee.

The bill would allow the schools to charge a maximum of $150 per
semester to foreign students for the funding of foreign student services such
as orientation programs, immigration processing and cultural orientation.

The bill has the backing of university presidents, lawmakers and taxpayers
and is expected to pass with no strong opposition.

PHILADELPHIA~The University, of Pennsylvania is jumping on the
computer bandwagon, like many other schools in the mate.

The university is investigating ways of implementing a computer network
in the nine college dorms and the living-learning programs. The committee,
consisting of students, administrators and faculty, are currently discussing
the feasibility of installing a computer system in the dorms linked to other
computers in the university.

MILLERSVILLE, Pa.—Speaking at the annual Spring Convocation at
Millersville State College, Boston University president John Silber blasted
educator labor movements and “verbally abused MSC union members and
administration personnel with his authoritarian style."

The president ofthe faculty union harshly criticized Silber by saying, “He
believes the ideal faculty would bury their heads in the sand and let people
like him protect them.”

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Penn State University received a $250,000
Ben Franklin Partnership grant from the state government to start an
advanced technology center in central and northern Pennsylvania.

The grant, similar to those of Pitt and CM U, will enable the school to
invest the money it receives into two satellite centers in the Harrisburg-
Lancaster-York area and Erie.

Pitt also received $250,000 from the state to develop new technology
centers in the Pittsburgh area.

The Pitt News, Wednesday March 23,1983

The witch looms large in the pop-
ular imagination as a creature

- beguiling, mysterious and often

sinister.
In legend, she is portrayed as a
howling broomstick rider who ve xes

innocent to mischief.

Shakespeare often represented
her in story as an oracle while Holly-
wood portrays the witch as a kind of
Halloween cartoon figure—the ugly
crone in a black hat who uses a
magic wand to transform her vic-
tims into toads.

The word “witch” continues to
evoke a vivid pastiche of images,
and the mythical picture is a seduc-
tive one—for the witch embodies
the kind of power that many a lowly
mortal longs to possess. She repres-
ents danger, magic, invisibility and
ﬂight.

Historically, the witch and her
magic have been subjects of social
and religious controversies that
have erupted’ into bloody persecu-
tions of women during the period
between the 14th and 17th
centuries. , '

This phenomenon, the “Witch
craze,” is explained somewhat by

Pigs, Wars and Witches: The Rid-
dles of Culture.” He claims that in
the early Middle Ages, the church
held the official belief that sorcery
and magic were merely illusions pro-
duced by the devil and that to
believe in their existence was
heretical.

In the later Middle Ages, as the
church’s inﬂuence was threatened
by heretical sects and peasant rebel-
lions, the church attempted to

retrieve power and at the same time
shift the blame for poor social and
economic conditions from itself by
making scapegoats of the weakest
members of the weakest class-
females.

Thus, it became heretical not to
believe in the power of witches, for
they were to blame for causing
plagues, killing infants and livestock
and fouling crops.

Feminist author Erica Jong said in
her book, “Witches,” “The church
established itself as the seeming
guardian of the people against the
forces of evil——just at a time when
people were beginning to doubt the
church’s magic and perhaps to
wonder why they needed a church
at all.”
Confessions were extracted from
women under tortures so bestial
and sadistic that many victims
admitted they were guilty of having
intercourse with the devil, feasting
on the blood of infants, causing
impotency in men and swearing alle-
giance to the god of evil.
Hundreds of thousands of women
met with a ghastly fate at the hands
of the inquisitors during these three
centuries, and their testimony is
in volume after

.    

the dreams of children and lures the

Marvin Harris in his book “Cows, -

Witchcraft In The 80’s

The devices used to extract the
condemning information from these
women left them with the choice to
confess (by which they would
escape further torment by death
through the comparatively merciful
means of hanging) or to accept the
hideous fate of being burned at the
stake.

Declarations of innocence meant
that more inventive means of “test-

..ing” were applied. One was the

dunking stool, another the “iron
maiden,” which was designed to
pierce but not kill the victim when it
closed around her. Piercing was the
means of locating the “devil's
marks” that were alleged to be
insensitive to pain.

revivalist witches will tell you that
witchcraft is a religion, and some will
tell you that magic is secondary.

“A witch, you may be told, is a
worker of evil, but revivalist witches
will tell you that they promote the
good.”

The historian Elliot Rose
observed that the word “witch” is
“free to wander among a bewilder-
ing variety of mental associations.”

The word “witch” itself is taken
from the Old English word “wicce,”
which has its roots in the word “wic”
,or “weic,” meaning to bend or to
change.

Thus, the witch can be defined-
somewhat as the “bender” or “twis-
ter,” although many practitioners of

 

Gerald‘ Gardner, the notable 20th
century witch, claims that asmany
as nine million women and some

men were sentenced to death dur-
ing these three centuries on charges
of witchcraft.

But who, or what, is the witch?
She cannot be confined merely to
her mythical status as the black-
cloaked night rider, and her histori-
cal impact is too profound to be
ignored in light of the phenomenon
that occurred because of her.

Are there witches? Are there
women (and men) who can manipu-
late nature to their will, or is the
whole idea of witchcraft in the 20th
century just an eccentricity adopted
by individuals and definition seems
impossible.

Author Margot Adler, who wrote
the book “Drawing Down the
Moon," is an account of the revival
of paganism in America today, said,
“The word ‘witch’ is defined so dif-
ferently by different people that a
common definition seems
impossible.

“A witch, you may be told, is
someone with supernatural power,
but revivalist witches do not believe
in a supernatural.

“A witch, you may be told, is
anyone who practices magic,’ but

the Wicca maintain that the word
means “wise,” and that they are the
seekers of wisdom.

Today, said Adler, there is a
group of men and women who refer
to themselves as neo-pagan
witches, and their communities
have sprung up all over the United
States and Europe.

Adler called this “the revival, or
re-creation or new creation of a neo-
pagan nature religion that calls itself
Witchcraft or Wicca, or the Craft,
or the old religion.

“This religion, with its sources of
inspiration in pre-Christian Western
Europe, has a specific history-
clouded though it may be—and a
specific way of being in the world.”

Many of these modern witches
are reluctant to refer to themselves
as witches, since the word itself sug-
gests something negative. Others,
however, regard it as a word to be
reclaimed with pride.

One neo-classic pagan journal

stated that the term was “inapprop-
riate” because it refers to “A
decayed version of an older faith.”

“Some witches prefer the word
‘craft’ because it places emphasis on
a way of practicing maqic. an occult
technology,” Adler said.

A Wiccan priest in Colorado gave
perhaps one of the most definitive
descriptons of the craft revival when
he said, “To be a witch is to draw on
our archetypical roots and to draw
strength from them.

‘‘It means to put yourself in close
consonance with some ways that
are older than the human race
itself.”

This is perhaps the key to under-
standing the witch as the changer of
definitions and relationships.

Isaac Bonewits, an occultist, said
that witchcraft was a religion that
began in paleolithic times with a uni-
versal worship of the goddesses of
the hunt and fertility.

The pagans and the heathens
(which mean, literally, people who
live on the heath, a tract of waste-
land, especially in the British Isles) of
the rural areas were slow to be
assimilated into the Christian faith,
and many kept to the old ways or
worshipped in both religions for a
time.

Bonewits said that the new Chris-
tian churches were built on the
sacred grounds of,_t_h~e old religions. i

Q - - II A ~-

rv fry.-.s-.. 1

The names of festivals were
changed, but the dates were kept.

Christmas, for example, falls on
the date on which the winter solstice
had formerly been celebrated, and
all All Saints Day became the new
name for the ancient harvest rituals.

Margaret Murray, an anthropolo-
gist who stirred up controversy with
her book, “Witch Cult in Western
Europe,” said that when the Chris-
tian persecutions began, the old reli-
gion was forced to go underground,
since the conquerors turned the old
gods and goddesses into the devils
of the new religion.

She maintains that the old religion
was kept alive in secret and only by
small families. The only records of
the old religion were distorted ones
produced by its enemies.

The modern craft, however, is
dismissed in many cases as fraud by
scholars who claim that the origins
of witchcraft are based entirely on
myth.

Adler claims that matriarchal the-
orists are responsible for forming
the Wiccan myth and prompting the
revival. She also states that it is
important, when attempting to
understand the Wiccan revival, to
not take myth as literal truth.

“This does not mean that they are
false, only to understand them one
must separate poetry from prose,
metaphorical truth from literal real-
ity,” she said.

One witch who lives outside of
Pittsburgh explained her involve-
ment in the craft and what the craft
itself means to others in the area.

“To put it very simply, the craft is
something that puts me in touch
with the forces of the universe, of
nature and of the power that the
mind is capable of seizing when it

applies itself to a different reality.

“There is nothing fearful or evil
about what we do, but there is a
possibility for doing tremendous
damgage to the self, and others, if
this power is misdirected. ‘This is
true in other areas of involvement
besides witchcraft, however.”

Modern witches are somewhat
secretive about their number and
the specific nature of their practices.

She said that her practice is “life
affirming, nature affirming and self
affirming, and I don’t cast spells on
people. The bad things that witches
are supposed to do have captured
the public’s imagination over the
years, and there is a great deal of
cynicism about it today.”

How does she feel about the des-
cription of witch? “This is a word
that still conjures, if I may use that
word, up some kind of dark, emo-
tional images in people. To explain
what we do and what we’re all about
would take months,” she said.

Many modern witches have
declared that the feminist move-

ment is a force that connects with
neo-paganism and witchcraft and
have set themselves apart from the
mainstream of the, other practicing
cults. '

These women feel that the craft is
a religion originally and historically
conceived in “rebellion against
oppression, and do not think that
the craft is incompatible with
politics.

There are covens of this kind
springing up all over the country,
according to Adler, and apparently
the idea is not a new one.

In 1968, an organization called
WITCH was“ formed, and its
members engaged in various politi-
cal protest actions. It was consi-
dered at the time a fringe
phenomenon by the mainstream
feminist movement, but WlTCH’s
sentiments are being accepted by a
larger number of feminists these
days.

_In their first manifesto issued in
1968, they declared, “Witches have
always been women who dared to
be..._courageous, aggressive, intelli-
gent, nonconformist, explorative,
curious, independent, sexually liber-
ated and revolutionary. (This possi-
bly explains why 9 million of them
have been burned.)”

Beth (not her real name) said her
coven consists entirely of women
and their beliefs follow along the
lines of the feminist covens in the
country that believe witchcraft and
membership in the craft are part of
the natural birthright of women.
There are approximately 21 of these
covens in existence today, she said.

“Every woman _is com with a
power that is mysterious and intimi-
dating to men,” said Beth. “This is
their power of regeneration.

“We believe that this power links
us spiritually with the positive,
regenerative forces fo nature—all
that is constructive and life—giving.
We are the natural healers.”

Psychologist Dr. Ann Belford
Ulanov said in a lecture that the
witch figure “...takes energies out of
consciousness and pulls them
toward the unconscious to forge a
link between the two -mental
systems...

“We know that the roots of our
consciousness reach deep into the
non-human, archaic unconscious.
The witch archetype makes visible
to us the very depths of what is
humanly possible, the great silences
at the edge of being.

“The radical impact of the witch
archetype is that she invades the
civilized community. She enters it.
She changes it...she heralds the
timeless process of originating out
of the unconscious new forms of
human consciousness and society.”

Although many laugh at the
idea of astrology—the ability to
"read the heavens"—-as a serious
science, those same people often
read their horoscopes in the
morning paper to see what kind of
a day they will have.

Often called the oldest science,
astrology is far more than the
commercialized, hocus pocus gim-
mick itis often believed to be.

"An astrological chart is a map
of the heavens for a certain
moment, for a certain place," said
Harriet Friedlander, who has been
involved with astrology for 14
years. i

By preparing and reading
charts, Friedlander said that she
"taps the heavens."

”It’s all written there," she said.

According to a set of basic prin-
ciples of astrology published by
the American Federation of
Astrologers, the horoscope wheel
is ”simply a map or diagram
against which the astrologer pla-
ces the planets in order to study
them."

‘Your chart is about as

private as your IRS

report.’

®

 

The zodiacal constellations are
composed of fixed stars that lie at
varying distances from the earth,
according to the federation.

When modern Western astrol-
ogers speak of the zodiac, how-
ever, ”they are referring to that of
the signs, which has no relation-
ship to the fixed stars further out
in space.”

‘Charts differ slightly depending
upon where they are made, said
Friedlander, who has lectured
extensivley and has made televi-
sion and radio appearances on the
subject.

If all of the planets were visible
in Pittsburgh, for example, they
would be seen at slightly different
angles than if they were viewed
from another part of the world.

Fortunetelling, ‘ another
ancient practice, has always met
with an attitude of mixed skepti-
cism and fear. Tarot cards, crys-
tal balls and tea leaves are
traditionally known as instru-
ments through which one can
tell another’s future, and these
tools have also been the subject
of wonder and question.
verbal since fortunetelling has
become such a money-making
operation in recent years.

During the witch hunts of the
1500’s, fortunetelling, punisha-
ble by death, was taken so
seriously that practicing it
allegedly proved that one was a
witch.

According to Wayne Shumak-
er’s The Occult Sciences in the
Renaissance, “quasi-ration

Written

Because of that, a chart written
in Pittsburgh wouldn't be exactly
the same as one written elsewhere
in the world.‘

There are five kinds of astrolog-
ical charts, according to
Friedlander:

0 Natal, in which one's chart is
determined at birth.

0 Mundane, which predicts

world events. _

0 Horary, which is the closest to
fortune-telling. This type of chart

usually done in confidentiality.

"Your chart is about as private
as your IRS report," she said.

There are all kinds of people
actively involved with astrology;
it is not confined to those who are
interested in ”mystical." practices.

Those with mathematical incli-
nations are often interested in
astrology because of ”the study of
cyclic movements and their corre-
lations in events on earth,”

0 Election, in which one can
elect a good time to do something.

0 Medical, in which one can tell

the possible days that a person‘

may be prone to medical problems
and the probable time of manifes-
tation. Friedlander urges that only
doctors, not laymen, practice this
type of astrology.

One use that Friedlander has
found for a horary chart is track-
ing down items that her husband
loses, which, she said, happens
frequently.

”This is the typeiof. thing that
you can do," she said, ”[but] charts

She said that astrology is

Some turn to the field because
”it teaches them increased psy-
chological insight into human
nature." I

There are also those who turn
to astrology just for fun and
become surprised when it really
works for them. .

The Pittsburgh Astrology
Association has 75-100’ members
although as many as 300 attend
their monthly meetings, accord-
ing to Mindy Krupp, the associa-
tion's president.

The purpose of the group,
which began in 1971, is ”to pro-
mote the study of astrology and
provide for the exchange of infor-
mation among those who are
interested in astrology,” Krupp
said.

They also try to educate the I

 o

The

public about astrology, she said.
One of their most important goals
now is to change the general atti-
tude toward astrology from that
of a form of mysticism to that of a
serious science.

”We’ve worked very hard to be
professionals, not to be part of the
occult," Krupp said.

”It’s an eternal thing," Fried-
lander said. ’’I don’t think a person
can learn all there is about astrol-
ogy in a lifetime.” '

She believes that the aptitude
for astrology is innate, but the

ability is not always developed.

”Anybody can study it in a class
situation or with private lessons
or by self-instruction," she said.

One aspect of astrology that
many find disturbing is the ”fate
vs. free will" discrepancy. In other
words, if something is destined to
happen, some people don’t want
to know about it in advance.

The majority of astrologers
believe, however, that horoscopes
show ”latent potentialities,” not
necessarily specific events.

One can tell stress points from
astrology, Friedlander said, but it
is impossible to predict events
from it. _

Charts can now be set up by
computer, butiFriedlander likes to
do it mathematically. It takes only
a few minutes to write a chart, but
about five hours is needed to pre-

F0rtune- Telling: Fact Or Fraud  

People believed that predic-
tions of the future do not depend
on instruments or cabalistic rites
but on the ability of the teller to
coerce with demons for insight
into the future.

“The demon sees the event,
rushes at superhuman speed to
another locality and announces
that it is about to happen,” Shu-
maker said.

There have always been peo-
ple who doubt the ability of for-
tunetellers, however, and these
people have become more ver-
bal since fortunetelling has
become such a money-making
operation in recent years.

“You can’t know the future
until it happens,” said Richard
Bush, chairman of the Para-
normal lnvestigating Committee

what they do? They take money
from people.-

“They have a belief system;
they think that they do it for real,
or they pretend that they do it,”
he said.

Bush said that he believes that
fortunetelling is a fraud, despite
its long history.

“People have been badly
fooled for centuries and centur-
ies,” he said. “The reason there
is such a long history of this is
that people are so easily fooled.”

One Pitt student, an avid
believer in the occult, who has
been reading tarot cards for
about four years sees fortunetell-
ing not as a way to make money
but to understand people better.

She learned the skill of reading
tarot cards through a friend and
has done some research of her
own on the subject.

“l’ve always been interested in
the occult,” she said. “lt’s not
that I’ma 100 percent believer; I
don’t sit down and plan every
day by the tarot cards or by the
Post-Gazette generalized‘

‘‘I do it because I’m interested

said.

"You can tell the chemistry ol

she said, ”the strong and the weal:

”By having a chart read prop-

a lot better," she said. She encour-

Krupp also finds that one's
chart is often used as a counsellin

need further counselling, we send .

”There's nothing supernatura

”This is the most experienced

Krause, Panthers Find The Path In Florida Sun

.1»;-

By SCOTT DELLETT

In previous years, a trip to Florida
by the Panther baseball team would
mean one thing—-coming back to

Pittsburgh with a record well below
.500. Last year, a tour of the Sun- I
shine State gave Pitt a 0-6 mark. But «
things have changed this year. Cur- '

rently, the Panthers have compiled a

3-1 record during competition in the 

Gulf Coast Classic, being played in
Panama City, Fla.

Thc‘purpose of this annual trip is
to give the team some playing time
before coming back to the North
and the usually unpredictable
weather. But Coach Bobby Lewis

may have re-discovered an ace

pitcher.

Sophomore Aaron Krause, com-
ing back after surgery which caused
him-to miss all but three innings of
the I982 season, pitched a two hitter
as the Panthers shut out Brooklyn
College 8-0. Krause struck out ﬁve
batters as he showed some of the
form with which he earned a 7-0
record in I981.

“There's no doubt that Aaron is
not going to give up a lot of runs,
and that ‘helps us,” Lewis said.
Aaron was throwing really ﬂuid; he
kept the ball down and he stayed
ahead of the batters."

Bobby Lewis

“He had no problems Monday."

With the return of Krause, the
Panther pitching staff should have
plenty of depth. Of the four games
played in Florida, three pitchers
have thrown complete games.

“We have had very effective pitch-
ing,” Lewis said. “We were able to
build up so they can throw I20
pitches. The only way we were going
to take them out is if they had
problems.“

 

So far, the only pitcher who has
not gone the distance has been Jim
Cosgrove, who gave up four runs
and six hits in a 8-5 loss to Wright
State yesterday.

The hitting is also up to mid-
season form. Thus far, sophomore
shortstop Paul Westwood has been
the hottest Panther at the plate. In
the first game against Brooklyn,
Westwood was’ a perfect two for two
with two runs batted in. He con-
tinued this torrid pacewith a three-
hit game against Wright State with
two runs batted in.

Second baseman Mike Miller has
also been hitting the ball well. In the
first Brooklyn and Wright State
games, Miller went four-for-five.

Against Wright State, the Panth-
ers combined for 13 hits, but a grand
slam home run by Wright State's
Fred Blair was the difference in
Pitt’s first loss as the Panthers had
an early 3-2 lead.

“The hitting has been distributed
very well," Lewis said. “I'm excited
that we are hitting so well.”

Lewis is also pleased with the play
out in the field—a problem area for
any baseball team this early in the
season. ‘

Uievich Just Misses Elite

By SCOTT DELLETT

For Lady Panther swimmer Sue
Heon, performance in the NCAA
National Championships held last
week was another in the long list of
achievements of her swimming
career. For teammate Jan Ujevich, it
was a disappointing performance
shejust cannot figure out.

Heon gained All-America status
in four events and set a Pitt record in
a fifth. Meanwhile, Ujevich failed to
qualify in the two events in which
she was entered and therefore
missed the opportunity to gain four-
time All-America honors.

Heon, a junior, gained her third
consecutive All-America award in
the 500-freestyle with a time of 4:49,
good enough for eighth place. She
finished l0th in the 200-yard back-
stroke (2204). Her best performance
came in the 400-yard individual
medley, where she placed fourth
with a time of 4:2l.4 She completed
the championships with an eighth
place finish in the 1,650-yard free-
style. Heon also broke a school
record in the 1,000-yard freestyle
with a time of 9:57.

The combination ofall swimmers
competing in one organization---the
NCAA— and the decrease from I6
to I2 people making All-America
status made it harder to gain such
honors.

‘9

“This year was more difficult,
Heon said. “Last year we didn’t
swim against the entire nation."

Heon believed she would have no
problem becoming All-America in

. the 4()()-yard individual medley, but

she wasn't sure on the other events.

“I wasn't confident in the other
events,“ she said. “But _I came up
with some pretty fast times."

5“ ._ R,‘ ,‘,n ,. ._ ¢,’_g,_q_¢,_¢,__p,,y,,.«r., um. vnrmo, r 4.0..-9, iv, in V» ‘I. 0.. v. tutu

Earlier, Heon travelled to Sweden
and France as part _of the United
states team, competing in several
international meets. Her perfor-
mance in Europe—-including a
second place finish in the 400-yard
freestyle—help her prepare for
Nationals.

“I think swimming in Sweden
really helped me,” she said. “It was a
breakthrough for me. I felt the confi-
dence in my abilities when I came
back home.”

The difference in Heon and Uje-
vich may have been in their
approach to the qualifying heats.
Both were seeded in such a position
that they were forced to swim in the
first heats, enabling competitors to
set goals while the people opening
had to swim only against the clock.

“For me, it was easier to swim in
the morning," Heon said. “I didn’t
have to worry about the
competition.

“There's not as much pressure on
me in the earlier qualifying meets.’

Ujevich encountered problems in
her qualifying heats.

9

“Swimming in the earlier meets
put pressure on me,” she said. “It
made me more tense.

“I've swum in early heats before
and done well. Something affected

3!

me.

She still can't figure out what hap-
pened, though.

“I really don't know," Ujevich
said. “I thought I was ready to swim,
but it didn’t come together at the
right time."

Despite the efforts ofcoach David
Belowich, Ujevich couldn‘t qualify
in the I00-yard individual medley --
her final chance to do what only
seven Pitt athletes have ever
achieved.

Still, Ujevich didn't take the event
like a life or death situation.

“I was relaxed for the last race,"
she said. “I didii’t think it was a now-
or-never race.. ljust wanted to give
it my best shot.”

“Everyone did what he could. I
was prepared well enough.”

But she hinted that she would
have changed things if she had a
second opportunity.

“Looking back, I would do things
differently," Ujevich said. “But I
don’t have that choice."

Next season, Heon will have the
opportunity Ujevich had. But she
isn't looking at gaining four-time
All-America status as a goal.

“I don't think of going into
Nationals gaining three-time All-
America honors," she said. “I just
swim to improve my times. lt‘s a
matter of swimming fast rather than
going for a place.”

A goal far back in the mind of
Heon is the I984 Summer Olympics
in Los Angeles. Her progress in the
pool will determine ifshe will try out
for the team.

“It‘s in the back of my mind right
now," Heon said. “It depends on

‘how well I train this summer and

how well I perform in Nationals in
August.“

For Ujevich, the NCAAS was
probably the last competitive meet
of her career.

“As far as I'm concerned, it was
my last meet unless I swim in master
competition," sha said. “I've had a
long, good, rewarding career in
swimming. Now I'm looking
towards new goals."

One goal is taking the law boards
in June in order to get into a law
school in I984.

Sue Heon has some more swim-
ming goals to achieve. Jan Ujevich
will have the I983 NCAA National
Championship to taint an otherwise
brillant swimming career at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. ’

It lsn’t Size That
Counts For Track

By DALE MOORE

Lady Panther sprinter "Gail
Counts may never break the tape at
the end of a race while running at
Pitt. It’s not that Counts isn't fast
enough to get to the finish line first;
the problem is that she would proba-
bly run under the tape rather than
through it.

Counts, who is‘about as tall as an
oversized munchkin, is one of four
freshmen on Coach Elbert
Kennedy’s young squad. And des-
pite her size, Counts will play a big
role in the development of the
women’s track program at Pitt.

Counts comes from a family of
four girls. She -was not the first ofthe
family to run, but she was the best.

In her junior year in high school,
Counts was invited to the Olympic
training center and turned in one of
the fastest I00-meter times in the
state of New York, where she lived
until moving to Cleveland, Ohio,
before her senior year in high school.

Counts gives much of the credit
for her success to her mother. “My
mother is my inspiration and my
biggest fan. I have never kept any of
the articles, but my mother has all of
them."

Counts was heavily recruited as a
senior in high school. Some of the
interested parties were Big East rival
St. John's, Ohio University and
Kent State, along with many other
smaller colleges closer to her home

Barring such unfortunate happen-

“We have more depth than the

And the Panther baseball team

‘‘It’s nice having this good start,”
Lewis said. “We are playing good

Even though training and racing
puts a strain on her busy schedule;
Counts doesn't think of giving up
running. “IfI didn’t run, something
would be missing. As much as I com-
plain, I know if I stop running,
something would be missing,” said
Counts.

Not only would something be
missing for Counts if she gave up
running, but Pitt would be missinga
great deal. In the Big East Indoor
Track and Field Championships in
February, Counts figured in I8 of
the Lady Panthers 38 points for a
fifth-place tie, in the competition.
Counts placed third in both the 55-
and 300-meter dashes and joined
teammates Sue Torre, Marsha Haw-
kins and Renee Henderson to take
third place in the I600-meter relay.

only help the program down the

order to help the Pitt program move

  Will Escalating Salaries Put Squeeze On Pros

 By MARK ‘A. SINDLER

The cold, bitter wind coming off
Lake Michigan swept over a deso-
late man as he drew closer to the
barrel of a slowly fading flame for
which Chicago is known these even-
ings in February, when even the
bravest of souls would stay indoors.

It’s the year 2013, in a world fairly
similar to that of today. What‘s
haunting about this man is the life
he’s leading now compared to what
he had. More background is

‘I 93 necessary.

He wouldn’t normally be hunch-
ing over this 55-gallon barrel, except
this evening he couldn’t bear to sit

atop the storm sewer that usually-

emits warming steam. The alley in
which he stands serves as his normal
roosting spot, and his sleeping quar-
ters are provided by the nearby Sal-
vation Army outpost.

Just three years earlier, the man——
his name isn’t important since his is
the last of a dying'breed——was hit-
ting the NBA boards so powerfully
that the Bulls just cruised to the
championship with him leading the
way.

Those were the years. He hailed
from UCLA and was snatched from

‘ the draft’s first round after Chicago

completed some wheeling and deal-
ing with Cleveland, the NBA’s per-
ennial doormat. Folks would even
go out of their way to liken him to
the Wayne Gretzky of hockey or the
Hank Aaron of baseball.

Not any more. This guy’s just
lucky enough to scrounge up a cou-
ple of meals a day. He would give
anything to survive the day-to-day
torture he endures. He'd even go so
far as to mug an elderly woman for a
couple dollars in change.

He is an extreme case of the
extremes. After the turn of the cen-
tury, his employer, the Bulls, folded

1'3-3‘ because the NBA faced a dried-up

 

cash flow.

One might imagine that other
major-league sports leagues faced
similar tragedies, but that’s as far as
this writer goes.

Could the NBA ever really fold? Is
it possible that the NFL will remain
immortal? Will today’s 26 big-league
baseball clubs endlessly serve up
seven-figure contracts to ignorantly
naive players?

It remains to be seen as to whether
a ceiling will ever be established to
cut down the skyrocketing salaries
of today's professional athletes.
Case in point is the NBA; its players
are preparing to strike on Arpil 2.

BIRTHRIGHT

621-1988

Despite average earnings of

$220,000, the players want more and‘

are willing to threaten post-season
play to get a new contract negotiated
their way.

 

Such a possibility points to the
fact that today’s amateur athletes
hoping for a career in sports are hav-
ing their potentially financially-
sccure lives endangered by today’s
selfish professionals.

For example, Gretzky has a con-
tract for 25 years for $1 million per.
It’s people like Steve Carlton, who
had to have his contract renegotia-
ted to a tune of$l .l5 million for the
next several years.

Players such as these two threaten
to drive sports to Chapter II--
bankruptcy. Once that happens,
there’s no professional team for the
budding stars of today to join
tomorrow.

The NBA is close to reaching
bankruptcy soon. Only seven bas-
ketball teams show a profit while I5
others are absorbing losses like huge
sponges. Only a crystal ball could
tell which league will be next.

Of course there’s a worn-out argu-
ment that states: Pay TV will bail
out those teams not making it.

Sure, that makes sense»if you
just got your walking papers from
Bellevue. If it doesn’t, then why
don’t teams hold competitions in
production studies. Because if eve-
ryone’s going to stay home and
watch games on the tube, then who’s
going to pay the extra money to
travel to the stadium or the arena?

There would be no purpose in
holding games in front of multitudes
of screaming fans. We could make
places such as the Los Angeles Coli-
seum or the Meadowlands symbol-
ize white elephants.

This will never happen, but stable
professional franchises are slowly
approaching the endangered species
list along with the Bald Eagle. It’s
not going to happen next week or in
the next five years. One might even
draw the human-aging analogy here:
There is no way of stopping it.

That is, unless current trends——
trends that will see athletes earning
as much money as there are bananas
in Costa Rica-are sidetracked.
There is no one solution to deter this
dissolving process. This corner has
no possible solution.

That‘s the sad part of it all.
Today‘s professional sports teams
are so mired in red ink that it will
take them as long to get out of this
mess as it did to get into it.

That pitiful-looking man in Chi-
cago may be thinking the same
thing. He never imagined that the
$5.75 million contract he signed for
six years would lead to this.

However, he is illustrating the
moral of this tragic possibility.
Today’s professional sports team
owners better wake up soon—before
their current nightmare becomes a
reality.

Good friends will help you study angles  
when all you can think about is curves.

It didn't take a genius to tell your mind wasn't
on your studies. But it (ll(l take a eouple of

smart rooniies to (lo soinetliing about it.

So out tame the calculators. And the
(loughnuts. And they started drilling you
until you knew physics as well as

 

you know yourself.

When it was all over. you
showed them that there was

one more thing you knew

something about—- gratitude.
Toiiiglit. let it be l.oweiil)i‘iiu.

    

Lowenbrau. Here’s to good friends.
