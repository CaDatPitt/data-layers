Independents
To House Hops

0 Fraternities Promise
Surprise for First
Progressive Dance

Independent students will be the
guests of men’s fraternities for the
ﬁrst time on the University’s camp-
us at a progressive dance that will
open all fraternity houses to them

on Saturday night.

“We invite all University students
to visit every. fraternity house
whether they have dates or not,”
says Don Cefaratti, C40, chairman.
“Everybody is urged to come.”

In answer to an invitation written
by Cefaratti to the Independent
Party, Jack Hoeveler, C40, said,
“We’ll all be there 100 per cent.”

informality is the theme of the
progressive dance which will be
held from 8:30 to 12:30 o’clock. Ac-
cording to this plan, there will be
tag dances at each house, and the
necessity of dates will be eliminat-
ed.

Each fraternity house will vie for
a prize to be given for the 111051:
novel decorations. Refreshments
will be served at each house.

There will be a surprise for both
fraternity men and independent stu-
dents, according to Richard Weiss,
C40, who is assisting Cefaratti.
However, the surprise will not be
revealed until Friday’s issue of the
News. “It will deﬁnitely give the
independents an edge over the fra-
ternity men,” says Weiss.

Invitations have also been ex-
tended to both the Amity and New-
man Clubs and to the women’s fra-
ternities. Because of Lenten re-
strictions Phi Kappa is unable to
participate in the dance.

Institution

Pitt Professors
Prefer Partners

Professors don’t need marriage
relations courses!

This was brought out in a survey
of marriage ﬁgures. among the elite
of the faculty; 93.8 per cent of the
Un_ivers_ity’s professors are married
as compared to the national mar-
riage rate of only 61.1 per cent.

To put this into a more concrete‘
example, nearly. nine and one-half
profs out of ten are married. The
national ﬁgures, taking in even the
Ozark mountains, average only six
persons out of ten.‘ ‘The "marriage
rateamong profs doesn’t carry over
to other university employees, how-
ever. Only 67.4 per cent of the of-
ficers, faculty, and clerical assist-
ants of the University are married.
This is still above the national
ﬁgure.

The latter marriage rate was dis-
covered when 515 out of 1.581 per-
sons were found unmarried.

go beyond the ordinary realm of
emotion and to portray the sub-

“ conscious mind.

wfth the character development of
NI. Zero, a “waste-product of hu-
manity.” Bill Patrick, C41, will

Senior Court to Hear
Names of Candidates

Tonight members of the nomin-
ating committees of 20 women’s or-
ganizations will meet on the twelfth
ﬂoor from 7 until 9 o’clock with the
Senior Court of WSGA under Mary
Gregg, C40, chief justice, as a clear-
ing house for Women’s elections
which will be held April 10.

During the past two weeks the
nominating committee of the or-
ganizations have met to select two
candidates for . each office. The
clearing house tonight will serve to
prevent one person’s being nom-
inated for more than one office, says
Miss Gregg.

The names of nominees will be
released next Wednesday after the
nominees have accepted and have
been approved by the executive
committees of the various organi-
zations.

Each organiz.~‘Ion has special re-
quirements for the nominees for of-
ﬂce, but most selections are made
on the basis of service to the organ-
ization and personal ability.

Organizations which will have
representatives at the clearing house
include Women’s Self Government
Association, Young Women’s Chris-
tian Association, Panhellenic Coun-
cil, Womepfs ,,Athletic. Asspcjatipn,
Women’s Speech Association, Wo-
men’s Choral, representatives from
the class of ’41, ’42, ’43, and the W0-
men’s social. fraternities.

Nominees will be informed of
their nomination by the members
of Senior Court, Miss Gregg, Ruth
Manns, Ed40; Betty Batty, Ed40;
Glenda Fitch, Ed40; and Marjorie
Kuhbach, C40.

Court Decides Today
On McCormick’s Sanity

The sanity or insanity of John L.
McCormick, ex-College Senior on
trial for his life, will be determin-
ed today, according to the ruling
of presiding Judge Samuel E. Kra-
mer.

This decision is apparently in re-
ply to the state prosecutor’s demand
that an ofﬁcial determination of
McCormick’s insanity be made. The
prosecutor’s plea, made late yes-
terday,, proposed either to im-
panel a new jury for the purpose
of judging the sanity of the former
University student, or to let a board
of judges pass final decision on
the case. ' ~

Earlier yesterday, the defense
psychiatrist Dr. George Reeve, had
testified that McCormick was in-
sane when he committeed the “im-
pulse crime." Dr. Reeve contends
that McCormick is still insane.

Describing McCormick as the
type of person who goes to the

theater and laughs and crys at the
same time because the stimulus is
too great for his control, Dr. Reeve
testified that the youth felt an urge
to control and dominate his par-
cnts, and that he was emotionally
unstable in his home relationships.

The alienist derived his conclu-
sions following four lengthy exam-
inations of McCormick. A col-
league, Dr. Joseph Fetterman, is
expected to take the stand today
and corroborate Dr. Reeve’s state-
ment that McCormick was not in
his rational mind when he ﬁred
three shots at the guard while hold-
ing up the Cleveland office of the
Western Union Telegraph com-
pany on January 8.

His activities prior to the shoot-
ing were not impulsive. according
to the psychiatric report which in-
dicated that McCormick’s past life
was undoubtedly bound up with his
present predicament.

of the petition sent to director
of athletics James Hagan by
the freshmen. The petition set
forth a list of purported griev-
ances against the athletic de-
partment and was signed by
nearly all of the University’s fresh-
man football, track, and basketball
players.

It was the ﬁrst time that the
signers of the petition had been
known publicly.

Athletic director Hagan stated, in
reply to charges by the freshmen
that they had been unable to see
him, that he had seen. the petition
for the ﬁrst time on Monday morn-
ing when he returned from a busi-
ness trip to Chicago.

Hagan explained that only one
freshman had been in his office dur-
ing the period from Wednesday,
when the petition was ﬁrst pub-
lished, until Monday. That athlete
had appeared Monday to apologize
for having signed his name to the
petition, Hagan said.

“I haven’t talked to any fresh-
men about anything ﬁnancial at any
time this year,” Hagan added. “I
do not consider the employment of
the freshmen or their tuition prob-
lems as within the province of the
athletic department.”

“VVhen the boys go to see Ray
Coss about jobs or any University
official about other ﬁnancial aid, I
feel conﬁdent that their needs ‘will
be handled competently,” he went
on.

The Trustees Authorize
A University Couueil

Announcement by the University that a. teniporary Council of
facult_\' and deans has been organized comes as welcome news of

more than ordinar_v importance.

According to the resolution of the .:3oa1-d of Trustees, which
autliorizcd. the organization, the l.’niversity Council is to serve for
one year and to make rectnninendations to the Board concerning the
desirability of estal)lislii11g_>j :1 permanent council.

lf the suggestions from the report offered last. _\'ea.r by the inves-
Tl,4‘&ll'lll;:f committee of the Board ofi'Trustees apply to this Council,
itiwill serve as an d(.lVi.\‘0l‘_\' body on educational and adniinistrative
policies, and in addition will act as a medium. by which the faculty
Did)’ he made fainiliai‘ with l'nive1"sitj' affairs.

The organization of the new co11ncil indicates that a broad

representation of the i’acult_v and administration exists.

Five offi-

cers of general administration, 14 deans, and 49 professors of de-
partments throughout the lTiii.ve1°sity are members of the Council.

In order to be a vital force in University affairs, the Universit_\'
Council must be more than a mere debating society or body of

‘ ‘ Yes ” men.

lt is likewise essential that the proceedings of the

llniversity Council be made known to the faculty and students.

The potential importance of the work: of the University Council
is shown by Dean '\\'illiani T. Root:’s report on topics discussed by

similar bodies in other Imivcrsities.

This report shows that. facult_v councils in other schools have
discussed budget policies, faculty appointment, tenure, and advance-
ment, improvement of teaching personnel, improvement of scholar-
ship and lf’(3S(’.2ll‘Cl.l, public relations, athletic policies, and student

problems.

The need for a U.niversity Council was pointed o11t in the report
of the investigating committee of the Board of 'l‘1-ustees last year.

The eoininittee declared:

“In recent years the Administration has held few meetings of its
deans as a group, and the former University Council hos been allowed to

pass out of existence.
and the faculties .

Both these developments are regretted by the deans

“The trend away from consultation with organized groups in the
University has lost for the institution a unifying force, a sense of respon-
sible partnership which the individual dean and faculty member would
like to feel for the affairs of the University, and mu.ch expert advice
which could be helpful in the guidance of the University along paths of

sound policy.”

The formation of this new l.Tniversity Council places upon its
nieinbers the responsibi.lit_v of niaking its ex.i.stence worth. while by
.~thowing an active interest. in tlpie affairs of the University which

t‘ 011 (3 ("I'll  (‘Ill .

And the action of the Board of Trustees in authorizing a new
l'nivers'ity Council indicates an effort to Jnaiutain un.derstai1d1ng'
and cooperation between. teaeliing faculty and administration.

Note on

‘The American \Vay’

Since the Communists, Nazi Band men, and Christian. ltlrontcrs
ll&'lV0“'l99(‘l1 basking. in the glare ofIcondemnation for their little
sclieines, the reaction of many Americans has been to cry “Sup-

press them I’ ’

And with that cry being extended to many groups who are
merely dissenters from ma jority opinion, it is refreshing to note this

s.tatcment of President lloosevelt:

“ We must be constantl_v vigilant. against the attacks of intoler-

ance and injustice.

\\'e must scrupulously guard the civil rights
and liberties of all c'i.ti7.e11s. whatever their background.

We must

If reason is to prevail against

intolerance, we must alwa_vs be on guard.”

College Daze

Reports the Oregon Emerald, “Students and teachers on the south
side of Condom hall were startled Wednesday when they looked out the
window and saw, where before there was but a blank, soggy stretch of
lawn, a Japanese plum tree in full bloom. Discarding their first Alladin’s
lamp theory and a subsequent: idea based: on .the growing. power of. Oregon

Student Views Merit

Politics Question.
Editor,
The Pitt News:

‘Well, well, and well. So the little
men have found a new phrase.

“Merit in politics,” they cry as
they sip their beers and sit back to
watcli 3. halo of purity descend over
the top of the Cathedral. A rose,
my dear fraternity friends, by any
other slogan still reeks of political
putrefaction.

Having self-righteously discover-
ed that they were wallowing in a
bag of unorganized nepotism and
disorderly plum-passing, the little
men have done what seems to be
their only solution to the problem.
They have assembled, called in I—F
council, and decided. ‘to organize
t.'«:eir nepotism and plum-passing.
At best. it is graft without chaos.
Supposing

Let us suppose that the boys are
really serious about the matter, that
not one of them would think to give
his roommate even a small job on
a ‘tea-dance committee unless "that
roommate had a 2. average and was
morally. mentally, and physically
responsible. Let us suppose that
the thin 13 per cent will refuse to
<'=\*(-hanee political purity for po-
litical security. Just for the silly
fun of it all, let us suppose that
these virtuous virgins, having once
gained the power to do so, will
peruse a lengthy list of names and,

after much tedious deliberation,
choose only those men who are best
fitted for each post.

Can they, then, ﬁnd among their
rank the best candidates on camp-
us? I think not. They may point
with pride to their high scholastic
average, which is undoubtedly high-
er than that of the rest of -the camp-
us. Granting that attainment in
terms of quality points is the truest
index to general ability, where does
that leave the fraternity bosses?
Mjore People, More

I have always been under the im-
pression that in specialized ﬁelds,
particularly in politics, functioning
capacity of the cream of the crop is
a more important determinant than
that of the cross-sectioned average.
Concede line that point‘ and’ I will
show you that the independent 87
per cent can draw up a list of nom-
inees far more meritorious than that
of the fraternity 13 per cent.

It is not because of fatigue that I
fail to become speciﬁc here. It is
not because of excessive laughter
over the new~slogan that I fail to
name names and gripe about groups.
I am merely sitting back and pray-
ing for an answer so that I can
write more concerning the active
independent minority and the stag-
nant fraternity majority of SFA.

Waiting outside our political
walls, the Greeks seem out of place
in their wooden horse.

Kal D-i-ﬁlers With Ed’s Five “Greatest”

By “Kai” Kalwary
Bernhartlt Was
Pretty Good

Just a fraction of a glance back
in our history, the seer, critic and
informer of Hollywood and things
Hollywood, all rolled into one—Ed
Sullivan, told the Scripps-Howard
public who were‘-the “ﬁve greatest
performers” of all times. He tab-
bed Enrico Caruso, Charlie Chaplin,
Edgar Bergen, George M. Cohan
and Mickey Rooney, for singing,
comedy, more comedy, more com-
cdy and more comedy, in that order.
Like it? I don’t either.

Let’s knife Rooney ﬁrst, for he, by
his very mention with the other
four, insults most everybody. He
has become fabulous as a juvenile
mugger. He entertains most movie
addicts—-and you know who they
are. Since we eliminated the snub-
nosed one ﬁrst, let’s continue up the
list. Cohan, a mature mugger, en-
joyed his success in the sort of the-
ater stuff that sends a barber’s hat
ﬂying and a high school teacher
flag—waving. Cohan’s humor was
(this is written in the past tense be-
cause of the Irishman’s age and un-
employment) about as clever and
subtle as Eddie Cantor’s.

Bergen is okay in small doses.
He and his dummy are palatable
only on variety bills, even to movie-
goers. Bergen is a helluva good
wise-cracker, but'cer-t;ainly no ﬁn-
ished comedian. Chaplin belongs.
I-lis make-believe is both artistic
and signiﬁcant. I never heard Ca-
ruso on the stage, so I am obliged to
leave him with Columnist Sullivan,
and, unfortunately, surrounded by
the many faces of Mickey Rooney.

Sullivan is more to be wondered
at than laughed at. How could any

journalist pass unﬂinchingly by the
established artistry of Nazimova,
Johnt Barrymore, Victor Moore,
Garbo, Alec Templeton, the Marx
Brothers and so many, many others?
l’ve heard it said that Sarah Bern-
hardt, Fritzi Scheff, and Eva Tan-
guay were pretty good, too!

Diagnosis . .

But No Prescription I

“We have maintained in the state
universities and endowed colleges
that it is we who have trained the
leaders of the nation. The evidence
is against us,” said Dean Christian
Gauss of Princeton university, at
Pitt’s Scholar’s Day Assembly. He
named some outstanding Ameri-
cans who never had been exposed
to the academic life. He said, also,
that “our colleges must become in
the new age not centers of statistical
information, of compilations, but
centers of free creation.” Old and
brave words.

But Dean Gauss appears to be a
victim of the very system which he
criticizes. He uttered for over
thirty minutes, and didn’t begin to
create even one idea.

Need the Scho1ar’s Day commit-
tee go so far from home to be told
that so called institutions of higher
education are getting nowhere fast;
that few industrialists and few lit-
erators hold college degrees? Cre-
ative scholarship needs a stiff shot
ofadrenaline. And there are here
at Pitt some men who could have
gone beyond Dean Gauss’ diagnosis,
and prescribed for education’s ills.
Let’s look to them in the future.

Strike Loses
Momentum

Conté'n,ucrl from page one
ing and grounds.

Assistant coach Nick Kliskey, one
of those charged by the lreshmen as
having made “promises,” said that
his only. part in the affair had, been
to send the boys to Coss when they
indicated they needed employment
and to promise them that those who
held averages of 1.5 or better at the
end of the semester might receive
awards from the University in the
form of scholarships.

Both Kliskey and Hagan
Monday that they did not know the
exact nature of the scholarships or
the basis for their administration.
S.t.1*ikers Apologize

Kliskey also announced that eight
of the freshmen, among them some
of the leaders in the “strike,” had
come to him Monday, apologized for
signing the petition, and indicated
their intentions of attending prac-
tice tomorrow.

Business Manager John Weber,
another ofﬁcial named by the fresh-
men in their charges Friday, was
approached for comment Monday
but st'ated'only, “I have nothing to
say.”

Complicating the “strike" situ-
ation was the fact that the petition
had. been mailed in a Hotel William
Penn envelope, leading to suspicion
that outside ﬁgures were involved
in the picture.

Unknown Man

Although freshmen athletes in-
sisted Friday that the demands had
originated entirely within their own
group, Kliskey revealed late Mon-
day that one of the leaders of the
movement had told him that the
petitions had been supplied by a
man whose identity was not known
to the freshmen.

According to Kliskey’s informant,
the man had said, “You sign them.
I’ll take care of the rest.”

A t h l e t i c department officials
pointed out Monday that among the
signers of the petition, who were
protesting against, among other
things, long working hours, were
the names of four boys who are not
employed by the University.

Workouts at Stadium 

Monday afternoon in the dim re-
cesses of the Stadium indoor ﬁeld
coach Ralph Mitterling put 36 aspir-
ing baseball players through a pre_
liminary workout.

The pitching staﬁ now numbers
six men. Veterans Andy Johnson
and Joe Triolo, "  "
together with
D u k e transfer
Bob Geiger, hold
down the south-
paw division of
the. staff. Soph-
o m o r e s J a c k
Brady and Jim
Simpson and sen-
ior Milt Ripp are
the righthanders.

E d g a r Jones’
potent punch at
the pl ate has
caused Mitterling to ponder over
the advisability of wasting his of-
fensive value by using him as a
pitcher.

Last year’s outﬁeld trio, Al Butch,
Frank Goelz, and Ed Keiper, are
.back this season, but .with. eight
other candidates, not including
Jones, right at their heels. Phi
Delt footballer “Snuffy” Hughes is
among the eight.

First base is the most sought after
post on the inner defense circle. Ed
Ziolkowski, “Lefty” Drobnuski,
Glenn Grubb, and Bill Meyers are
all angling for the spot vacated by
Guy Guadagnino.

Eddie Straloski, Bob Foliart, and
Al Holbrook are after the inﬁeld
positions they held last year but
Mike Mitchell, Dave Myers, and
Ralph Fife are going to offer some
competition.

George Hartman, by virtue of his
part in last year’s campaign, holds

Phi Kaps Take Intramural Cage
Title in Sloppy Win over Jerks

By virtue of their 19-18 victory
Wednesday over the Jerks, In-
dependent champions, the Phi Kap-
pa quintet won the All-Intramural
basketball crown for the second
consecutive year.

So far as actual playing ability
was concerned, the game did not
bring out the true merit of either
team for they repeatedly were
guilty of bad playing. Poor pass-
ing, poor shooting, and rough play
characterized the game.

The fraternity lads took an early
lead in the game as Jim Herron net-
ted the ﬁrst ﬁeld goal and from
there to the ﬁnish the Phi Kaps
were never headed. Tom Hol-
loran sparked his team’s play in the
first half by breaking up enemy
plays and sparkling offensively.

At half time the score stood at
13-9 after last minute ﬁelders by
Anania and Stetler of the Jerks
brought hopes to their fast fading
team.

When the second half started, the
Jerks began to dominate play as
they came to life to move within
two points of the champions. Jack
Stetler was the Jerks’ leading light
as he played brilliant ball on of-
fense and defense.

All his work was in vain for the
passing combination of the Phi Kap
floormen began to work with ma-
chine-like precision to, retain their
lead. Midway in the half the Phi
Kaps suffered the loss of their
stellar center, Jack Glenn, via the
personal foul route. ,

With one minute to play the
Jerks scored a foul to bring the
score to 19-18; but the Fraternity
champs held the ball for the rest
of the game to become Intramural
champions.

Jack Stetler of the Jerks and
Tom Holloran of the Phi Kaps were
high scorers with nine points
apiece.

The Coldspots tangle with the

four-way tie for first place.

The Coldspots now hold the lead,
but if they lose Wednesday they
will be even with the De.t'rosters.
Snowﬂakes, and Penguins, each
with three wins and two losses. In
event of a Coldspot loss, the cham-
pion will be decided by a four-
team elimination series next week.

The Penguins earned their place
with the leaders last Monday when
they downed the Seals in a thrilling
game, 56-48. Lewis, star Penguin
forward, took all honors by break-
ing Artman’s scoring record by
two points as he garnered 22 mark-
ers on 11 field goals.

Thinclads Eye
Butler Indoor
Relay Crown

Seeking‘ another successful inva-
sion of the Midwest after their ﬁne
showing at East Lansing last week-
end, the University of Pittsburgh
track men this week-end make
their animal journey to Indianapo-
lis for the Butler university indoor
relays.

Makeup of the squad is still un-
determined, but the same men who
won points in the ICAAAA and the
CIC meets will probably make the
trip. Frank Ohl, the broad-jump-
ing junior, returns to the wars on
the boards after a month’s absence.

With Ohl back in the leadoff slot,
the chance of the mile relay team

to retain the title it has held for
two years becomes a pretty good bet
rather“ than a long shot.

One of the feature races of the
meet should be the duel between
Barney Ewell, sensational Penn
State sophomore, and Bill Carter
and Hap Stickel, the sparkling pair
of Pitt sophomores. Ewell took the
m-easure of the Pitt pair in the
ICAAAA 60-yard dash, but Stickel
ran the 75-yard dash in 7.5 last
week-end to come within one-tenth
of a second of the world’s record for
that distance.

Spring Intramural Entry Lists
To Reach Final Deadline Today

Today is the deadline for all entries in the spring intramural program
according to an announcement issued last Monday from the intramural

ofﬁce.

Actual competition will probably
get under way on March 20 although
this date is subject to change. Di-
rector Potts pointed out that the
date for the opening of the leagues
will depend a great deal upon the
weather. Continued cold weather,
in all probability, would force the
intramural oﬂice to set the date back
several days.

All berths in fraternity mushball
competition have been ﬁlled.

In the fraternity races, attention
will. be paid to golf, tennis, and
horseshoes, three sports Delta Tau
Delta teams dominated last year.
Since the Delts have displayed con-
siderable athletic prowess in winter
sports. many intramural followers
are conceding them a good chance
to repeat their title tactics.

Mushball play was overshadowed
last year by the Sigma Alpha 1VIu
squad who succeeded in preventing
the Delts from making the program
a virtual one team affair.

In the playoffs to determine the
intramural mushball championship,
the SAM boys were defeated by the
Independent winners, Gamma Gam-
ma Woos.

All but the golf matches will be
played “up on the hill.” Golfers
will play on the Schenley links.

and unseal the entire lot.

The original idea, according to
Loeb, was to Contact every under-
graduate in order to make plain the
tact that the Owl could be ’oo'..1ght
by an undergraduate, and that a
c:=.mpaign offering easy credit pay-
ment ot‘ $1.50 down and $2 on de-

livery would end this Friday.

Using the University’s special
mailing peimit, the staff hand-ad-
dressed and personally licked the
4.000 envelopes in time to make tire
lust mail on Tuesday. Mr. B.::tkin’s
special University of Pittsburgh
Day program at the post otﬁce Wed-
nesday morning delayed prospec-
tive Owl subscribers from rushing
in their $1.50 down for another day,
however.

First Exhibit

Fine Arts Gallery Shows
Iceland Artists’ Works

First exhibition of paintings by
Icelandic artists to be held in this
country , announced by the Amer-
ican Federation of Arts, will be on
view in the gallery of the ﬁne arts
department until March 30.

These oil paintings represent the
work of a remarkably competent
group of artists, a number of whom
are self taught.

Painting is not one of the arts
most deeply rooted in Iceland, but
through these paintings this group
has successfully portrayed the life
of their country. The works depict
the rugged character and the stern
simplicity hf the inhabitants of Ice-
land.

The connotation of color is rather
miraculous. Prevailing is a sombre,

almost austere tone, yet the clear
sharp quality of the noonday sun
shining on the snow is emphatically
in view.

Sweinn Thorarisson, who studied
in Denmark, portrays, through his
painting “Asbyri,” one of the
strangest phenomena in Iceland, a
huge rocky formation caused, ac-
cording to Icelandic mythology,
when the horse ridden by the god
Odin stamped his foot on the earth
and left this great cleft shaped like
a horseslioe.

European taste is reflected by the
figure paintings and landscapes sub-
mitted by Jon Thorleffson, who su-
pervised the decoration of the Ice-
landic pavili.on at the New York
World’s Fair.

Law Student .7Waintaiiis Hlgli
Scholastic Average, Fine ,l0llS

Holding five different part-time
jobs during the school term, Robert
A. Doyle, L42, has managed not
only to graduate from the Univer-
sity’s undergraduate school without
any outside ﬁnancial help, but also
to enroll in law school and main-
tain the third highest quality point
average of the freshman class.

The ﬁve positions occupied by the
law student include: working b-e-
hind the counter of the University
cafeteria in return for his meals;
ushering several afternoons each
week; acting as assistant librarian
in the law school_’s ﬁfteenth ﬂoor
library; clerking in a downtown de-
partment store on Saturdays and
holidays: and teaching English to
a sophomore class of high school
girls.

“Teaching school takes up more
of my time than any of the other
jobs,” Doyle said. “I must plan the
course in advance, prepare quizzes,
select references, and correct pa-
pers.”

On the basis of scholarship sev-
eral appointments to the editorial
board of the Law Review,»student-
edited publication, are made each
year. Doyle has received one of
these positions and added the Re-
view’s work to his already imposing
list of duties,

Moiitl1”s Busiiiess
Shows Net. Loss

Although the decided slump into
which business had fallen since
early December has been checked
somewhat, the line connecting Jan-
uary and February business condi-
tions on the graph extends deﬁnite-
1y ﬂoorward. In summary, that is
the report issued by the Univer-
sity’s Bureau of Business Research,
whose statement showed that busi-
ness activity for the month of Feb-
ruary is 11 per cent lower than in
January. ,;

However, the report shows,
financial conditions today repre-
sent almost a 25 per cent rise over
conditions of a year‘ ago.

The pronounced decline in steel
activity and in blast furnace oper-
ations accounted for most of the de-
crease in production.
