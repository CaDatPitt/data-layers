Students To Vote Once More In Poll
On Child Labor Amendment Question

 

Although it was announced in The

News Wednesday, that the Pitt Poll
of campus opinion had come to an end,
the Pitt Poll will go on—for another
issue at least.

The new question concerns child la-
bor, and is designed to determine opin-
ion on an amendment to the Federal
Constitution to regulate and prohibit
the labor of persons under 18. The
ballot for this question appears at
the bottom of this page.

At the present time a child labor
resolution has been voted by Congress,
but it has not yet been ratiﬁed by the
36 states necessary to make it an
amendment to the Constitution. Dur-
ing the past, Congress has sought to
regulate child labor through its power
over taxation and interstate com-
merce, but each time the Supreme
Court has declared the statute to be
unconstitutional,

The formal question on the ballot
is: “Do you favor an amendment to
the Constitution giving Congress the

power to limit, regulate, and prohibit
the labor of persons under 18 ?”

Ballots for this question will be
printed also in Monday’s issue of The
News, students are asked to ﬁll out
the ballot and drop it in one of the
ballot boxes placed around the cam-
pus. The boxes will be in Alumni
Hall, Thaw II-Iall, State Hall, Cathedral
lobby, and in The Pitt News office,
Room 709, Cthedral.

The campus poll is being sponsored
by The News in conjunction with The
Pittsburgh Press and the American
Institute of Public Opinion.

The Great American Tragedy

ROBABLY THE MOST discouraging picture in Amer-
ican life today, is the sorry mess we seem to be ma.k-
ing of trying to create an everlasting peace. One‘ won-
ders whether all the strong sentiment for peace is not
. . . . - H H
merely pious lip-service being paid to a worthless
cause. One begins to question the worthiness of our
present peace movements when one looks across the
country and notices the strange bed fellows that are
rallying around the banner of peace.

On the extreme right, we ﬁnd many patriotic organi-
zations preaching peace, while eulogizing great wars
and war heroes of the past. This group maintains that
ultra-patriotism and extensive preD?11‘ed11€‘-SS 3-T6 the 33'
lient factors necessary for peace at home, and abroad.
The American Legion preaches for “strong neutrality
legislation to keep us out of other nations’ wars.” In
the very next breath, they advocate an adequate national
defense. ,Why do we allow ourselves to be fooled con-
tinually by this pseudo-paciﬁst, fence-straddling posi-
tion? One can respect a man who will choose one side
or the other, but to respect one who jumps from side to
side as it suits his opportunism, is intellectual stupidity.

On the left side of our political see-saw, we ﬁnd as
many varying shades of paciﬁsin as there are French
political parties. On the extreme left, we ﬁnd the group
that will not participate in any armed conﬂict, civil or
international. Nearer the center, we ﬁnd those who
would ﬁght in “good wars, or just wars, hr defensive
wars.” From this point into the center, we ﬁnd various
groups favoring military sanctions; economic sanctions;
proﬁtless wars; government control of munitions; and
combinations of these and many other pet theories.

How can one be expected to maintain faith in an
American peace movement, when that movement has so
many diﬁerent bases, and means so many different things
to so many different people? If we are to achieve an
everlasting peace in the United States, we must bend
our efforts toward one end, with one purpose, and one
program for which all can bend their efforts. Peace is
impossible unless it embraces all, and it cannot embrace
all unless there is a unity of action and purpose. We
must submerge our personal ideas in order to attain a
common end. Without this, the American peace move-
ment can mean nothing, and can do nothing.—W. S.

 

Students In Politics

SEVERAL CAMPUS GROUPS will send official aswell
as unoﬁicial delegates to the Western Pennsylvania

Regional Conference of the American Youth Congress,’

meeting this week-end. The ﬁrst question that comes to
our minds is, Should students interest themselves in
politics? Should students try to solve certain questions
facing. American youth today? Educators across the
country have been looking for a satisfactory answer to
this question for years, and as yet no suitable answer
has been found.

When we begin to realize that one of the primary func-
tions of a university is to turn out educated, intelligent
citizens, qualiﬁed to grapple with the important issues
of the day, there can be no question that conferences
such as this one are important to a well-rounded
education.

At present, there can be no question.that the apathy
on the part of students to take a part in politics, even
school politics, is an unsound condition. If the leaders
of the society of tomorrow are to take any intelligent
part in the life of the community, they must be trained,
and where can they best be trained if not in the colleges
and universities?—W. S.

 

Hail New SFA

T HE STUDENT-FACULTY ASSOCIATION goes into

its third year of activity this week. The executive
committee has been selected, and is already laying plans
for a deﬁnite course of action for the coming year.

For the third year, student government will be in the
hands of the Student-Faculty Association, but from‘ all
sides one hears complaints that we have neither a fac-
ulty association nor a student association. It seems‘ that
in the past, toomuch emphasis has been laid upon the
selection of dance chairmen, and on “the selection of a
committee to investigate and report.” With the excep-
tion of a few, faculty members look upon SFA as a
three-ring circus, wherein “a committee is chosen to in-
vestigate and report.” Not only have the faculty lost
faith, but many students have also lost faith in their
student government, as demonstrated by the apathyon
the part of students to participate in campus elections.
A mere 129 votes was the absolute minimum for election
to this year’s assembly, out of a student body of over
4,000. H

New SFA members, your constituents request of you a
widening of the base of student government! Upon you
rests the responsibility of strengthening our conﬁdence,
as well ‘as that of the faculty, in student government,
our government.—W. S. .

More Scholarships, Fewer Battleships

£6 ENATE PASSES LARGEST peace-time naval ap-

propriation bill in the history of the nation!”
“The United States is nearer war than at any time since
1917,” declares Senator Gerald P. Nye. These and simi-
lar startling pieces of news are conveyed to us daily.
What is our nation coming to, anyhow? As we becoming
more civilized, or are we becoming more blood-thirsty?

The Nation clamors for peace, and the Senate votes
away 529 million dollars for the Navy for next year. The
Senate earmarks 115 millions for warship construction,
including the building of two ﬂoating-fortress battleships
in event that any of the other great naval powers start
building additional capital ships.

VVhile the Senate votes away $10,175,000 a week, to
be used during the next year, thousands of school chil-
dren are prevented from attending school, because either
they have no schools to attend, or their parents ﬁnd it
diﬂicult to provide them with shoes from an income of
ﬁve to ten dollars a week. After all, one must not ex-
pect senators to know how to manage to eke out an
existence on 90 cents per week for each member of a
family. All they can be expected to know is how to
manage to eke out an existence on $10,000 per year, plus
commissions accruing to all good senators who squander
529 million dollars on ship building for the beneﬁt of
certain ship builders. Maybe some day our senators will
wake up to ﬁnd that it is no longer necessary to make
bigger and better appropriations for navies—al1 poten-
tial victims having perished from the face of the earth.

After pledging to support the Constitution and the
government, let all senators. pledge themselves to more
Let us remove all
causes that might lead to the ruin of such a distin-
guished body as the United States Senate, and ultimate-
ly of the entire nation, by depriving them of such expen-
sive toys as 529 million dollar appropriation bills for
navies.——W. S.

Pederson. Discusses Details About Denmark

While Studying System In A

Visitor From Copenhagen
Lectures To Classes
In Education

- By William R. Murray
From the land of 3,500,000 people
and 3,000,000 bicycles, A. Ritsmar Pe-
dersen has come to study the Amer-
ican school system.

Mr. Pederson is a teacher from C0-
penhagen, Denmark, a guest at the
home of Dr. G. D. Whitney, professor
and director of vocational teacher
training. He is studying methods of
education used in the United States,
and has lectured to Dr. Whitney’s
classes in education and Dr. John A.
Nietz’s classes in comparative educa-
tion.

The educational system of Denmark
is quite different from that of Amer-
ica, according to Mr. Pederson. All
education is controlled by the federal
government from the capital, .Copen-
hagen. Five borgmesters compose
the governing body, one of whom is
head of the educational system. Un-
der him is the school director, through
whose ofﬁce all hiring and dismissing

of teachers is performed. Each‘school-'

has a principal and staff.

“The borgmesters correspond to
your mayor here in Pittsburgh,” said
Mr. Pedersen, “the chief difference
being that they do not go out in
public as Mayor McNair does.”

Classes begin at 8 o’clock and con-

tinue until 14 o’clock. (Denmark
uses the 24-hour clock.) Each class
has about 28 or 30 pupils. Most of

the teachers are men. The adult high
school, planned by Grundtvig, noted
Danish educator, is attended by farin-
ers’ daughters and sons, when they
have reached the age of 16..The boys
go to school for ﬁve months in the
winter, and the girls go for three
months in the summer. Most of the
students go for only one session. The
only thing in America to compare
with G1-undtvig’s system is the even-
ing school.

In order to become a teacher in
Denmark, one must attend the high
school for four years. The ﬁrst year
the students take 36 periods; the sec-
ond year, 38; the third year, 40; and
the last year, 40. After this course
has been completed satisfactorily, the
student is qualiﬁed to teach in the
elementary schools, If he wishes to
teach in the high schools, he must
take additional courses.

When making application for a po-
sition, a teacher must copy all his
papers and submit them to the school
directors’ office in Copenhagen, where
they are ﬁled. As soon as a teacher
is needed, he is notiﬁed. Once hired
as a regular substitute, he cannot‘ be
ﬁred without positive proof that he
has failed in his duty or committed _a
misdemeanor. If he is dismissed and
can 5-prove -that the ‘dismissal - was - un-
warranted, the government is obliged
to pay him a regular salary for life,
unless he obtains another position
with the government.

There is little unemployment in
Denmark, according to Mr. Pedersen.
The farmers work cooperatively, each
supporting the common slaughter
house, a dairy, and other economic
corporations of the community,

Guest Tells Of Homeland’s
Holiday Celebrations,
Teaching System

Holidays are celebrated with much
more enthusiasm than in the United
States. Christmas, Easter, and New
Year’s are the most important. On
Christmas Day, no sto1‘es except
bread stores are allowed to remain
open. All work stops at four o’clock
on the morning of the twenty-fourth
of December. No trucks are allowed
in the streets. Everyone goes home
to eat boiled rice and fried goose
steak. After a heavy meal, the fam-
ily goes into another room to view
the Christmas tree.

The family dances around the tree,
singing; they close with a happy
hymn to the tree. Each person col-
lects his gifts under the tree, and re-
ceives a glass of wine and some cake.
More nuts are eaten, and more candy.
“Finally,” says Mr. Pedersen, “we
roll into bed because it impossible to
walk.”

New Year’s is a combination of the

American Independence Day and
Halloween. Firecrackers are explod-
ediand ~much noise prevails. Res-

taurants are permitted to remain
open all night, a thing unheard of all
year, for there are no night clubs.

Mr. Pedersen will return to Den-
mark June 5. Dr. VVhitneY. W110 is
president of the Pittsburgh Council
of Adult Education, will accompany
him. He expects to remain in Copen-
hagen six or seven weeks to study
the school system.

(the maligned columnist)

In re: William Colker
Dear Bill: Your scathing of Monday noted and snick-
ered at. Not in defense of this column (tripe to you)

or his own policy, the writer wishes publicly to state
that he has made repeated requests to the student body
for tid-bits to include in the column; this was so- that
he could gossip about a representative cross section of
the entire student body.

The undergrads, however, have never complied with

an answer. The writer regrets that his scope of ac-
quaintances cannot include all of the student body; this
is, of course, most unfortunate, and through circum-
stances he is forced to write about only the people with
whom he’s acquainted.
. Please do not take this as an affront to your interest
in the News. Not being personally acquainted with you,
this columnist had to resort to such a method because
he is sure that the editor would not have accepted a
“Letter to the Readers” as  defense of the column. Be-
sides, it’s rather silly to write letters to newspapers.

Yours for better scandal.

P. S. Better lead an A No. 1 campus life, ’cause from
now on we’re Sherlock on your trail.

Nearly one-half of the students did not know the

Early Editions Of Owl Tell
About WUP, 1908 Faculty

 

Past Yearbooks Reﬂect Styles Of Puﬁ‘ed—S1eeve Days,
Include Copies Of Brashear, Holland Lectures

By Milton G. Lehman
While Editor Elmer and Business Manager Strong of the Pitt Owl go
over the ﬁnal galleys for the 1936 edition, and elected Editor Rogaliner and
Business Manager Goldstein make plans for “a different and unusual Owl”
next year, some thirty copies of previous editions lie stacked in the back

room of the Cathedral Library.

The Owl has ﬂown with the Univer 9

sity from the days on Cherry Alley
when Pitt was WUP, and has brought

along with it the evolution of the
school.
The copy of 1908, a small edition

about the size of your political science
text, was published by the junior class
of the University. Dedicated to Wil-
liam Thaw, donor of the Thaw Observ-
atory in Riverside Park, the book con-
tained copies of lectures of the late
Dr. Brashear, ‘noted astronomer and
professor, on Samuel P. Langley, in-
ventor of the airplane, and by Dr. Wil-
liam Holland, recognized authority on
entomology, on the North Side Observ-
atory, built in October, 1900. "

Of interest to the sophisticated Owl
reader of today are the pictures and
comments on the faculty of 1908. The
teacher's gallery occupies over 50
pages of the journal. The biographies
are unusual. One, on Dr. Edward
Stieren of the Medical School, ex-
plains: “Dr, Stieren is noted for hav-
ing a clear eye and a good ear. He prac-
tices what he teaches——wears glass-
es.” Another member of the faculty
is thus described: “’Dr. Hawkins
(John A.) is noted for his European
experiences. He insists on students
in the medical department bringing
in their own patients."

Following the lengthy treatise on the
professors, the. b0ok,carries on with
some 100 pages taken up by a list and
descriptions of every student in the

. school.

\

The space remaining is devoted to
description of activities. The Univer-
sity Courant, the combined Journey-
man, Panther, and News, was founded
in 1888, and is given a lengthy write-
up. The debating team, whose picture
shows it to be a group of men who
must have spoken through their mus-
taches, used as their standard sub-
ject: “Resolved: that the Tendency

‘of the United States Government to

Rapidly Increase its Navy is to be
Condemned.” And this was before the
war! Statesmen today are still won-
dering.

. In 1-912, the leatheretteowl changed
its form and some of its tradition by
printing pictures and writeups of the
sorority girls. One in particular would
shock the hairwashing blondes of to-
day: the sorors, one and all, wore
long, bushy hair, together with the
traditional full blown blouses and
puffed sleeves.

In 1920, when the Owl has assumed
something resembling its present
form, the foreword read: “We here-
with present an Owl that had caused
much work, some thought, and a great
deal of worry.”

But this hooting could go on for-
ever. Let it be said that the Owl has
changed since 1908, and, in its present
form which should appear on campus
soon, will be, to all indications, “the
real bird.” At least Editor Elmer
thinks so.

Summer Formals
In Order At Ball

Frank Dailey’s Orchestra Chosen
For Social Affair Of Seniors

“Dress for the Senior Ball goers,”
according to Charles Ebert, Jr., C,
chairman, “will not be strictly formal
but rather will be summer formal.” In
the past the phrase “summer formal”
to those who attend University dances
has come to mean white suits, tuxe-
dos, dark coats and white trousers, or
other dark and light combinations.

For women the proper dress is sum-
mer formal. But Ebert admits that
maybe the women will know better
than he what to wear.

Frank Dai1ey’s 14-piece Columbia
Broadcasting orchestra has already
moved from its stay at the Meadow-
brook Club in New Jersey, and has
started a road trip that eventually

‘leads to Pittsburgh, the Senior Ball,

and the bandstand in the main ball-
room of Hotel Schenley on Friday,
-May 22.

Four hours of dancing that night
begins at 10 o’clock. There will be a
Grand March, during which time the
favors and programs will be dis-
tributed. Ebert has not as yet re-
leased the name of the dance queen
for the evening, but it is rumored that
she will not be an undergraduate.
Tickets sell for $2.50 and may be pur-
chased from any member. of the com-
mittee, at the dean of men's oﬁlce,
Room 801, Cathedral, or from William
Daufenbach, Alumni Hall.

Siedle Announces Better
Prospects For Positions

Although placement of graduates in
education is still handicapped by the
employment of so-called “home-town”
teachers, there is an upward trend
in the prospects of this year’s crop,
announces Theodore A, Siedle, direc-

tor of the Teachers Appointment
Bureau.
Mr, Siedle has sent out from 75

to 100 recommendations for teaching
positions. “General secondary educa-
tion teachers are still the most un-
favorable placement,” he said. “Coin-
mercial, physical, and elementary ed-
ucation majors; and secondary educa-
tion teachers with unusual subject
combinations have the best chance of
obtaining positions.”

This year’s graduates who have al-
ready been placed are: Grace Siefert,
commercial education, at Martinsburg
High School, Blair County; Vincent
Weinman, commercial education, at
Masontown, Fayette County; Newman
Kamerer, physical education, at Aspin-
wall; and Lois Rex, English, in Ger-
man Township, Fayette County.

Four Students Selected
For Cap Gown Positions

 

William Blum, C38, Riaymond
Scheib, C37, Milton Brown, Ed37, and
Leopold F. Koeberlein, C38, will head
next year’s Cap and Gown shop.

Blum, who is the new production
manager, was assistant production
manager of this year’s show, and was
tapped into Undergraduate Cap and
Gown Club. He is succeeding Wilson
Griffiths, C37.

Ray Scheib, new business manager,

has spent three years on past Cap and

Gown business staffs. Brown will take
over charge of costumes from Charles
Bucher, C36.

The new publicity chairman, Leo
Koeberlein, is succeeding himself. He
handled news releases for “Out For

To Meet W.

Tracksters
Va. Tomorrow

 

Mountaineers Rate Even Chance To Upset Pitt Varsity;
Tost-Geclwilas Dual In Mile Run To Feature

It ’s been three years since the “Test Virginia “liill-billies” have
copped a track bill from the Olsonmen, but in tomorrow’s feud on
the Mountaineer track, they are given at least an even chance of

taming the Panthers.

_\Vith the ﬁrst event scheduled to start at 2 o’clock, freshman
and varsity squads of the two rival schools match strides in what
should prove to be two very close-decision meets.

With Art Thomas, VValter Good, and’

Andy Lasky far below par due to in-
juries, the Pitt varsity will start on
just about equal terms with the Mor-
gantown boys. Penn State, victor
over West Virginia earlier in the sea-
son, lost a ﬁve-point decision to O1-
son’s squad last Saturday, but those
injuries and the strength of the Moun-
taineers in events that show weak-
ness on the Pitt rating sheet would
make things even.

The little Panthers, like their big
brothers, have plenty of weak spots
in the ﬁeld events, and will depend on
fast sprinters and liurdlers to come
through to balance the score.

Tost May Upset Dope

Red Tost makes his fourth start
against Gedwilas in the mile run, fea-
ture event on the varsity program.
In their three previous meetings, one
in cross-country, Gedwilas has breast-
ed the tape ﬁrst every time. However,
tomorrow, Red is expected to upset
and defeat “Barney.” This has been
the Plumville, Pa., junior’s best year
in track to date, with three clean-cut
victories to his credit in as many
starts.

Gedwilas will team up in another
race, this time the two-mile run, with
Franklyn Theriault of the Panthers
in what is expected to be another
close race. This dual will be run
after the mile event, and Theriault
has an outside chance to take the
favored Mountaineer distance star.

Pitt should dominate the javelin
with Gene Taano a sure winner and
Sowiski and Cort Leigh battling for
the remaining places. However, in
the discus and hammer events, Pitt
has only Jim Fassinger as a likely
point-getter.

Pitt Weak In Hurdles

The situation in the hurdles is even
more discouraging for the Olsonmen
with both Good and Lasky on the
sidelines, and only Mike Sowiski to go
after the points.

Pete Bennett and Redmon Oden
should have the high jump pretty
much to themselves, and in the pole
vault Taano and Bob Gerrety are both
expected to place for the Panthers.

While their varsity mates are seek-
ing their third straight victory, the
Little Panthers will be shooting at
some kind of a record themselves. Ac-
cording to The News ﬁles there is no
record on the books of a Mountaineer
yearling decision over a Pitt squad.

Favored Mushball
Nines Win Games

PiKA, Theta Chi, Lambda Chi,
SAM Teams Cop Frat Games

 

 

Tuesday’s Intramural mushball ac-
tivity was characterized by diversiﬁed
diamond brilliance, ranging from ex-
cellence in the pitching box to power
from the home plate section where
all the batting is done. In the eight
games played, eight victories went
to the eight favorites.

From the pitching point of view,
merits should be given to Milt Tau-
berg, _Student Alliance moundsman,
and Harry Pinsky, who has been lob-
bing ’em over in the Interfraternity
leagues for three years with such ef-
fectiveness that Sigma Alpha Mu has
had to be reckoned with by many a
Greek titular aspirant.

Tauberg’s team, the Student Alli-
ance, continued to sit on top of the
Independent ﬂagpole by defeating the
Civil Engineers, 8-0, Tuesday at Up-
per Trees Field. Their other victory
was at the expense of Kappa Alpha
Phi, defending Intramural champions,
Since then they have been strenghen-
ed by the acquisition of Joe Garcia
and Aristotle Kopetas,

Pinsky Pitches Shutout

Pinsky’s performance put the Sam-
mies ahead of Phi Gamma Delta, 8-0,
and also put them in a. ﬁrst place tie
with Pi Lambda Phi for the League B
toga. Only one Phi Gam batsman
reached ﬁrst base safely, and that was
after two were out in the last half of
the seventh inning. Pi Lambda Phi
earned its second triumph by a 2-0 de-
fault from Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

Slugging was the keynote of the
Theta Chi, Pi Kappa Alpha, and
Lambda Chi Alpha victories. Six
home runs helped boost the Theta
Chi score to 24-14 over Sigma Chi in
the opening League C game. Lambda
Chi knocked out a. 11-8 triumph over
Phi Epsilon in the other C section
struggle. '

PiKAs Hit Hard

A PiKA bombardment blasted out
an 18-11 win over Delta Tau Delta in
the remaining hard-hitting game. This
was a League A affair, as was the

Golfers, Netmen
Meet Grove City
For Second Time

Panther Teams Favored To Repeat
Early Victories Over Grovers ;
Souchak Plays No. 1 Post

Playing their ninth consecutive
match away from home, the Panther
golfers travel to Grove City tomor-
row for a return match with the Grove
City College linksmen.

In the ﬁrst match between the two
teams at the start of the season, the
Pitt boys, playing on the local Al-
coma course, whitewashed the Grove
City lads, 9-0, in taking all the sin-
gles matches and the three best ball
matches.

Since then, the Panthers have look-
ed bad at times and looked good at
times, for the most’ part looking good
even in defeat. Tomorrow’s match
should, if the Panthers play the
brand of ball they are capable of, be
Panther Victory No, 4 of the season.

Coach Art Snyder will use almost
the same lineup as the one used
against Grove City in the ﬁrst meet-
ing. The only probable change will
be with the No. 1 and No. 2 playing
positions, where Frank Souchak will
move up from the No. 2 to the No. 1
post in Pat Symonds place. Symonds
will play in Souchak’s former posi-
tion.

Netters Aim For 13th
Consecutive Triumph

Believe it or not, Coach Dave
O’Laughlin’s Panther tennis team may
break an all-time University record
this season for a consecutive victory
streak. When the short-clads came
through with a triumph over Du-
quesne last Monday, it marked their
12th straight victory.

Finishing last season with a seven-
match streak, the netters added ﬁve
more thus far this season and hope
to get No. 13 tomorrow at Grove City.
The all-time record stands at 17. 0'

Wediiesday’s encounter with Car-
negie Tech was postponed when May
showers dampened the Stadium courts
sufficiently to make playing impossi-
ble,

To break the record, the netters
have anything but smooth sailing
ahead. After the W & J and Penn
State contests next week, the court-
men will take the road for a trio of
engagements, meeting Navy, George-
town and George Washington.

Navy will be the big question mark
on the trip, the Middies having been a
Panther jinx for the past two seasons.

Not much trouble is expected in to-
morrow’s match since the Pitt boys
have already downed the Grovers this
season by an 8-1 count.

‘Coach O’Loughlin will probably rely
on the same team that whitewashed
the Dukes. In that case the roster
would include Bob Madden, Ralph
Bald, Joe Madden, Roy Heckler, Irv
SOIOW. and “I’sa” Mogan. (some pun).

Choral Spectators
Brave Ill Winds,

Receive Reward

Tschaikowsky Ballet Is Highlight;
Other Numbers Reveal Abilities
Of Director, Women’s Group

By Robert Brown

Those people who braved the brief
return of winter weather Wednesday
evening to go to Carnegie Music Hall
were rewarded in hearing the W0-
m_en’s Choral present one of the best
University-sponsored programs given
here in the past season. The group
was under the capable direction of
Mrs. Gertrude N. Ayars.

Although Tschaikowsky's colorful
“Sleeping Beauty Ballet” was the ar-
tistic triumph of the concert, other
numbers revealed considerable mu-
sicianship on the part of the choral
and its conductor. Chief among these
were the compositions by three pro-
liﬁc composers of 17th century Italy.
It is this reviewer’s belief that more
numbers from this plrticular school
of music should be heard more fre-
quently on chorus programs, for al-
though it did not reach the levels ob-
tained by the German contemporaries,
Handel and Bach, it nevertheless pro-
du_c_ed music of a certain melodic
ﬂow and exquisite chording that has
never been equaled or recaptured.

Early Italian Songs

Marco Cesti, the Venetian pupil
of Carrisimi, was represented by his
“Vlfhere Sleeps My Beloved;” the
Neapolitan sonata writer Francesco
Durante by “Dance Little Maid;” and
Bassani by the beautifully shaded
“Rest and Slumber.” The Choral,
using the Deems Taylor arrangements,
gave these numbers good intonation
and proper subordination of parts to
make an essentially artistic presen-
tation.

More modern works were given by
the Choral in presenting Reynalde
Hahn’s “The Perfect Hour,” “The
Marriage of Roses” by the French or-
ganist-composer Cesar Franck, and
Fourdrain’s impressionistic “Along
the Willows.” Capable solo passages
were done by Carolyn Hall, Dorothy
Zimmerman, and Dorothy Swearer.

The quartet of the Choral chose to
render three numbers: Shubert’s ac-
companiment to Shakespeare’s “Hark
Hark the Lark,” Robert Franz’s
“Marie,” and the Kodaly arrangement
of the Hungarian folk song “See the
Gypsy.” The sheer melodic content
of the two German masters’ songs
were quite fully brought out, but the
difficult and tricky folk song with its
dissonances and odd jumps gave the
group some trouble.

Excellent Collaboration

Of course, the ballet by Peter
Iljitsch Tschaikowsky was the major
work of the evening. This great Rus-
sian apostle of melancholy left be-
hind him the morbidness of the last
symphonies, the quartets, the string
trio, and some of the songs to write
the charming and dainty music for
the old fairy tale of the sleeping
beauty.

The dancers, under the direction of
Miss Elizabeth Rearick of the depart-
ment of physical education, and the
Choral collaborated to give the work
a splendid performance. The major
dancers were Misses June Greene,
Peggy Donley, Marjorie Noah, Ruth
Anderson, Eleanor Sandberg, Mary
Jo Kunkle. The presentation was
further enhanced by the costumes de-
signed by Miss Eleanor Boland and
the skillful lighting effects by the
Pitt Players’ technical staff.

Good tone and sensible musician-
ship by accompanist Lucille Hamilton
helped to make the concert the suc-
cess that it was.

‘Back To Nature,’ Predicts
Reporter Of New Fashions

Back to Naure will be the slogan
of American people this summer. And
they’ll appreciate nature not only in
tennis, golf, and riding, but also in
the good old—fashioned ways, such as
ﬁshing, hiking, gardening, and bicy-
cling,” predicts the Fashion Reporter,
the semi-monthly publication of the
Retail Research Bureau of the Univer-
sity.

The latest edition of the Reporter
gives suggestions for the correct
clothes for each of the season’s major
activities.

For the tennis fans there are the
professional pique tennis dresses with
their thirteen gore skirts, or other
dresses appropriately short a11d full,
sleeveless and low-backed. Then there
are pleated shorts of gabardine or
heavy cottons with shirts of light
weight wool, and‘ long enough to stay
in shorts, action backs, and short
sleeves. Or maybe you would prefer
some culottes (the divided skirt is
the most important style development
of the season) in cool washable mate-
rials, such as pique or broadcloth,

If golfing is your favorite sport,
then you will want some shirtwaist
dresses in washable silks and syn-
thetics, cottons, lightweight ﬂannels,
and knitted dresses. Be sure that
your dresses have plenty of shoulder
room that won’t prevent that perfect
would-be-drive. The Fashion report-
er suggests skirts with fulness, of
light weight wool tweed with pullover
sweater or twin sweater, or with
shirts. of ﬂannel or cotton. Chilly days
will call for a jacket or vest of ﬂannel
or suede.

For a cool morning ride you may
choose jodhpurs in cotton whipcord,
linen if it is the heavy crush-resistant
type. Smartest colors are white,
ginger, yellow, gray and navy. Woolen
tweeds and gabardine jackets will be
perfect to wear with these.

Maybe you’re one of the coeds plan-

Cwens Plan Initiation
For 30 New Members

The traditional Anglo-Saxon cere-
mony of the formal Cwen initiation
will be held next Tuesday evening at
Heinz eH.ouse when 30 freshman wo-
men are inducted into the sophomore
honorary.

The ritual committee, with Martha
Fuller, C38, as chairman, is in charge
of arrangements for the banquet,
which climaxes this year’s Cwen ac-
tivities. Other members of the com-
mittee are Ethel Shrom, C38, Susan
Soyak, C38, and Edith Barnett, C38.

Kappa Phi Kappa

 

Kappa Phi Kappa, School of Edu-
cation fraternity, is planning a sum-
mer formal dinner dance at Bill
Green’s Terrace Gardens, to start at
6 o’clock on May 29. Mr. and Mrs.
Theodore A. Siedle will act as chap-
erons.

 

Sophomores Swap

Stories, Jokes

Tall stories, jokes, and ideas will
be the chief commodities exchanged
at the Swap Party the women of the
class of 1938 are sponsoring today
at 12:30 o’clock in Heinz House.

Guests are asked to come after
breakfast and bring their own lunch.
However, for box-office appeal, the
social committee, headed by Rose
Nugent, will seave iced tea. Vic-
trola music is also promised for
those who wish to swap dances in-
stead of abstractions.

Officers for the coming year will
be presented to the class by Janet
Hallock, the outgoing president.

ning to go on a bicycling trip after
school is over. If you are, then choose
a pair of culottes, because they allow
the required fulness, and second, be-
cause they can be smartly ensembled
with other items to make a costume
for any occasion. The Fashion Re-
porter suggests three-piece play suits
for bicycling, too. Shorts are worn
when in motion and skirt is added
when stopping in at the Inn.

For ﬁshing, the type of ﬁshing. the
climate and the place are the decid-
ing factors as to the clothes.

Overalls of gabardine, slacks, or
culottes may be worn if you are
actually planning to till the soil.

As for the wardrobe of the specta-
tor spcrtswomen, the classic shirt-
waist dresses are still the mainstays.
Important notes are stitched borders,
contrasting bandings, and the favorite
buttoned-dow11-the front treatment.

Cotton and linen dresses with inter-
esting color and detail treatment, such
as rick-rack edgings, petticoat ruffles,
and Tyrolean tricks are favored by
the Fashion paper.

Summer suits will hold an import-
ant place in the wardrobe of the
spectator. They may be had in cool
tropical suitings in white and pastel
colors.

Important fabrics for summer
dresses are printed wide Wale pique,
sheeting, peasant prints, acetate
sharkskin, dainty sheers, shantung
and silk linen.

Blue and white leads in the colors
for the summertime. Pastels will be
a bit deeper, the Reporter tells us, and
contrasting combinations are more
important than ever. Such colors as
sun yellow, rock brown, desert sand,
cactus green, coral reef and mountain
haze blue were inﬂuenced by the State
of California. Flower colors such as
dahlia, zinnia, violet, buttercup yel-
lew, shamrock, gladiola, and arbutus
will make your summer clothes even
more dashing.

Panther Has Coed
Editor For First
Time Since 1917

When Irene Matveak, Ed37, starts
arguing with the printers about the
next issue of The Pitt Panther, she
will be the first women editor of the
magazine since 1917 and the second
head lady of the Panther since its
beginning.

The magazine had its ﬁrst woman
editor, -Beryl‘Pape, in the fall of 1917.
Perhaps the exodus of men students
to the World War inﬂuenced the se-
lection of a coed——but the young lady

remained in office only until Decem-
ber, 1917, when publication of the
book was suspended. The exact reason
for discontinuing the magazine is ex-
plained in an old Owl as the fact that
“the book went from bad to worse"
and a private history of publications
states that the Panther had its tail
pulled because it grew a little too
frisky and aroused the displeasure of
the censors.

Publication of the Panther was re-
sumed in 1918 by ODK, but the edi-
torship remained strictly masculine
until this week when the publications
board selected Miss Matveak as next
editor of the magazine, replacing
Russell Connolly, C36.

The editor-elect is a junior in the
School of Education and confesses
she never took a journalism course
‘in her life. She started working on
the Panther last fall as secretary on
the business staff, advanced to the
editorial staff, and became associate
editor.. Concerning her work for next
year, Miss Matveak is planning to
keep the same general make-up of the
magazine, the only distinct change
being to substitute a sport page for
the men’s fashion columns.

Her other activities on campus in-
clude SFA, secretaryship of Delta
Delta Lambda, Xylon, and knitting.
