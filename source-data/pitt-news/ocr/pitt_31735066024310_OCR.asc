night visitation hours for members

satisfied with theiriactual living‘

arrangements.” I

RSA believes tight security and
privacy rights can be maintained by
continuing the current policy with
the exception that overnight guests
ofthe opposite.sex should be permit-

:—*’ ted in the residents’ rooms during

the week,‘ Schott said.

The other rules of the present pol-
icy would still apply, such as requir-
ing the roommate’s approval of

having_ a visitor and signing in and ~

out visitors, Schott explained.

“In most ofrvthe residence halls
there is no need to impose the pres-
ent policy of restricting overnight

site sex of the residents, because they

said. . I

feedback from the students that they
want the policy changed,” ‘Schott.
explained. ’

The RSA doesn’t believe -that the
recent survey done on thevisitation
policy is a fairrrepresentation of how
resident students really feel, Schott
said. ' ,

“A broader based survey with a
larger sample of resident students
should have been taken.”

The survey was too ambiguous
and did not ask the student to give a
simple yes or no answer to-whether
they wanted a specific change in the
policy, Schott said.

become the first Pennsylvania state

to strike, as a result ofan election to
take place Wednesday.

Wednesday's election, in which all
members of the campus police

excluding the three lieutenants, five
clerical employees and the director
of the department, will participate,
will determine ifthe Fraternal Order

the trade unions (Solidarity) get, the
more they want, and the more the
government promises, the lessit can

workers’ demand for higher wages
which, if granted, ‘would lead to

This would hurt the economy’ still’
more and cancel out anybeneﬁt
from the higher wages.

Visiting the United States as an .

Pitt News Staff Writer

John Zingaro is the Citizen's
Consumer Party candidate for one
of four City Council seats up for
re-election, including a special elec-
tion in May to fill the seat vacated by
William Coyne.
Mr. Zingaro is 26, single, and
A earned a B.A. in journalism and
communications from Point Park
College. He was formerly a VISTA
Volunteer (1976-78) and Executive
Director of the Pittsburgh Neigh-
borhood Alliance (1978-79), and has
spearheaded community drives and
/forums on behalf of health care,
labor and neighborhood groups.
Presently he is consumer representa-
tive for Allegheny County, member-
ship coordinator for the Semple

I. Street Co-op, and a writer for City

Times.

Pitt News: «How does this cam-
paign differ from your '79 campaign
when you ran as an independent
candidate?

Zingaro: In '79 I had to organize
the whole campaign from scratch.
The platform was a platform I drew
up myself without any input. It was
things ‘I percieved the city would be
interested in from the community
work I've done. It wasn't a group of
people who said, ’you’re going to be
our candidate and you're going to
run on this.’ I couldn't start until the
middle of August. I still got five
endorsements (Pittsburgh Federa-
tion of Teachers, 7-ll Democratic
Club, Pitt Professional Union, The
Political Club, and the New Ameri-
can Movement Newsletter). I think I
got more votes per dollar than any
other candidate. This year, I get to

A run year-round. l have three times

» the amount of time to organize, to .

fundraise, to get my name known.
My running in '79 was an isolated
electoral excercise.

Pitt News: How is your local cam-
paign a part of the Citizens/Consu-
mer cause?

Zingaro: This platform l’m
representing is part ofa national and
statewide movement. The Consu-
mer Party is I3 years old, based in
Philadelphia. lt’s catching ‘on state-
wide. We barely missed getting
ballot-status statewide. Nationally,
there is the Citizen's Party, and they
asked the statewide Consumer Party
to become their state committee. So
we have national, state and local
committees, with everyone agreeing
on -a course of action. My political
campaign is a part and parcel of a
national movement. We think a lot
of our problems locally have their
root causes at the national level.
When Barry Commoner came to
Pitt in September, he said I'm going
to tell you how to revive the steel
industry, ’but before he did that he
had to talk about how to revive the
auto industry because it's the biggest
customer of steel. Before he did that
‘he had to talk about how to go to
cheaper sources of fuel. So he talked
about our energy policies which are
geared towards non-renewable pol-
lutants as sources of fuel.

An important part of our cam-
paign is to show a relationship
between loss of funds at the city level
and an increase of funds in the mil-
itary budget. First, it has an effect on
the progress of the city as a viable
place to live. Second, it has an effect
on the progress ofthe world towards

. peace.It's a broad issue, but it really
does trickle down to your street. Our
national politicians are very confi-
dent that they are leaders by por-
traying the Soviet Union as
inherently aggressive. That’s not a
sign of leadership, that‘s a sign of
terrorism. We have the power to
solve problems. We have expertise
and knowledge, and I think that's a
position of strength our leaders

The Congress raised the military
budget and the result was land and
waste taxes were raised two years in
a row. Our biggest challenge in this
campaign is to break down the mil-
itary budget forthe actual terrorist
policy that it is, and to take away the
cloak of patriotism that national
politicians wrap around it.

Pitt News: How ‘does the military
budget issue translate into the City
Council race itself and city politics?

Zingaro: Every neighborhood
gorup you talk to wants better city
services. If you talk to the mayor,
he'll tell you that what people don't-
want is community advisory boards
or policy-making, say in City Hall.
What they want is their garbage
picked up. That’s what I want. The
Mayor thinks you can get more city

department directors at reconﬁrma-
tion hearings - the Water Depart-

ment Director and" the Fire
Department’ Chief. Caliguiri didn't
replace them until a year later. City
Council could have replaced any of
those powers seriously.

They have the power to conduct
investigations. City Council should
use its subpoena powers to find
information. When the closing of
J&L Steel was announced, Lloyd
McBride, president of the steel
workers, said that information we
need to revitalizeithe steel industry is
being held by the companies, infor-
mation that shows how much money
is being diverted out of steel into real
estate and chemicals and other
things. City Council should use its

America. In order for PPG to move
into that area, City Council had to
approve the zoning change. City
Council could have done some bar-
gaining to provide merchants free
access to whatever property they
wanted in exchange for a tax break
to PPG. At the time the PPG prop-
osal passed City Council, the local
Teamsters were picketing PPG
because of the corporations anti-
union activities in the south. City
Council could have made inroads
into organized labor by saying ‘If
you want this proposal approved,
you have to clean up your act in the
South.’ Instead, they uprooted the
merchants, paid no heed to the
Teamsters, and gave the corporation
what it wanted—a tax break.
There are some staples of life:

John Zingaro: "An important part of our carnpaign is to showa relationship between loss  ‘ ‘
of funds at the city level and an increase of funds in the military budget.” Roth phbto '

funds by calling for a recount in the
census, which is taking money away
from other cities—this is not a rea-
sonable solution.

How many Pittsburghers know
that Mayor Caliguiri signed a peti-
tion asking for the ouster of
Brszinski, which said he was escalat-
ing this militaristic view which was
causing our city to lose money?" In
essence, the Mayor is in sympathy
with our position that the military
needs to be reduced. City Council
has passed a resolution calling for
passage of the Transfer Bill now
pending in Congress, which would
transfer military funds to human
needs. So the Mayor and City Coun-
cil pass some sort of paper resolu-
tions and try to pass them off as a

public service, when, in fact, they--

have the civic resp.onsibility to edu-
cate"and organize people on those
issues by which, within a year, they

can affect -national. policy,-and the-..

national course of funds. Proposi-

. tion I3 is an example of how local

residents can influence public pol-
icy. This is a meaningful way of
bringing added funds for city servi-
ces. Police and fire departments
were both funded by revenue-..
sharing, which was cut by Congress
at a time it increased the military
budget. You have a genuine lack of
funding for human services

statewide.

Pitt News: How can City Council
best facilitate its power to improve
city services and the quality of life in
Pittsburgh‘?

Zingaro: The stereotype around
Pittsburgh is that City Council has
no power at all, that it's an advisory
body. We have a really strong Coun-
cil. but I don't think they know it.

City Council has the power to rat- '

ify or rejectany appointment by the
Whe

   
   

subpoena powers to try to find infor-
mation, to bring executives from the
steel companies into City Council to
find out this information and. with

steel workers, try to come up with a -.

solution to revive the steel industry.

City Council hasthe power oftax-
ation, not the Mayor. How do they
use that power? U.S.Steel is not revi-

talizing its steel industry all’ along I

the Mon Valley. Instead, it’s getting
into chemicals and into real estate.
The result is layoffs in Homestead

and the Mon Valley. The Mills are _

decaying. U.S. Steel says it will com-
mit itself to pollution.\control, but
instead, it'lo_bbies for just the oppo-
site with.the' County Commission-
ers. So what does thevCity Council
do to make U.S. Steel more respon-
sible to the community? They give
them a tax break on real estate,
which makes U.S. Steel‘s decision to
go into‘ real estate all the.-more
palatable. /-  ~ A «

Look at the problems: unemploy-
ment, pollution, being held captive
by non-renewable sources of fuel.

~Who makes these decisions‘? Who '

makes the decisions to lay offsteel ‘

workers? To pollute? These things
are deliberately planned and based
on one thing-making a bigger profit.

City Council has the power of taxa- .

tion. lthas the power to inﬂuence
industry right where it feels it-in the
pocketbook. They're going along
with the idea that corporations
which cause pollution, layoffs and
non-renewable energy exploration.
should be given money and incen-
tives. and say these businesses are
going to solve our problems.

PPCi is an exampleof acompariy
that usurped prime property down-
town _by, moving someesmall mer-

 
  
   
 

food, a job, fuel forgasoline and
home-heating oil, health care and

of Council and the Mayor should be ‘.

united on islto. protect the people/of
Pittsburgh such that these staples of
life do not go beyond the, means of
the average middle income tamily or
Pittsburgh, and aren't subverted to
large businesses. _

Pitt News: How "does your cam-
paign‘ impact directly on the
university?  1 I

Zingaro: Thetwu biggest indus-

tries in Pittsburgh are education and
health care,‘ of which the, biggest
employer" is the University of Pitts-'

employer _is the university. In ‘78 _

its commitmentto find adequate off- F7,

you fund adequate off-campus

and they think to provide adequate

garbage pick-up, police protection,

fire protection. The fire at the Chan-
ce’s R was, in essence, on the univer-
sity campus. That's an area the
university needs to impress upon the
city. ' «

Pitt News: What about the park¢;"*,'

ing problem in Oakland?

Zingaro: There’s a proposal by ‘

Pitt to build a parking garage near
Trees Hall before City Council.

Building more parking lots is not the_

answer. When you.,build more gar-
ages, you’re encouraging people to
drive into the neighborhood, caus-
‘ing congestion and an increase in car
pollution. It’s not addressing the
need for improved mass transit. The
neighborhood groups are negotiat-
ing with the hospitals and with Pitt
for sticker parking to give residents
first crack at parking. 1 think that’s a
stop-gap policy. I think the more
meaningful and, long-range policy
for Pitt would be to impress upon its
students and faculty members and

clerical workers to use mass transit.‘
and to do that they have to impress

upon PAT to do a better service, and
to do that they have tojoin with us to
get more funds from the military
‘budget; It isn’t an easy thing to dot?)
claim the military budget isn’t work-
ing in the best interests of the nation,
isn’t defending us, and is sapping

Student Government Board Creates Two New Committees

By VALERIE JACHIMOWICZ

lhe Pitt .\L‘\\s Stall writer

as The Student Government Board

5

\'

voted last week to approve the crea-
tion of two new standing commit-
tees. a Student Relations Committee
and a Governmental Relations
Committee.

Board member Terry O‘Rourke
explained that the Public and
Governmental Relations Commit-
tee was split into the two new
organizations.

One of the new committees will
continue as a lobbying organization
in the place of PGR. This organiza-
tion was renamed the University of
Pittsburgh Governmental Relations
Committee, committee Chairperson
Chip Roth said.

Roth added that the split was
made as a result of the need for a

Police Union

police for their

activities.

campus safety

So the major difference between
the two acts is that under Act I95,
the labor organization can strike to
settle wage and benefit disputes. and
under Act I I I the organization sub-
mits to binding arbitration with an
outside panel of three arbitrators to
settle the dispute.

In" addition to determing if Pitt’s
Campus Police will be represented
by the FOP as a collective bargain-
ing unit, Wednesday's election will
also determine if the campus police
will be forbidden from walkout or
strkes.

”The FOP, Lodge 99, feels it is
very unprofessional for a police
officer to go out on strike because
strikes by police invariably do more
harm than good,” said Sgt. James
Chester ofthe campus police who, in
addition to being actively involved
in changing the labor organization

public relations committee that was
discussed during the student govern-
ment retreat.

“We wanted to give the student
government board an opportunit_v
to address the need for better stu-
dent relations," Roth said.

He added “Now I'll have more
time to concentrate on politics and
securing the needed money for Pitt."

The committee that will be
responsible for public relations has
been named the Student Relations
Committee.

The main purpose ofthis commit-
tee, according to O‘Rourke, is “to
better direct the information flow
out of the student government
offices. I"

She added, “The committee will
be responsible for programming
events during the summer to make
student government more visible to
freshmen."

One of the major tasks ofthe Stu-

dent Relations Committee will be ’*

the publication of a Student
Government Newsletter.

The purpose ofthe newsletter is to
“inform students of the Board and
standing committees efforts and
achievements and to keep students
out of the dark in regard to what
Student Government is doing for
them," according to O’Rourke. '

“A lot of the apathy and miscon-
ceptions about student government
results from the present use of the
media," O‘Rourke said.

“Through this more centralized
information flow students will
become more aware of student
government." she added.

The formation ofthe two standing
committees necessitates a re-write of
the bylaws to include the new com-
mittees. An ad-hoc committee was
created to study both the bylaws and

status of Pitt's campus police is pres-
ident of the FOP, Lodge 99.

Chester predicted the election to
be successful in approving the FOP
as the campus police labor
representative.

”I feel there will be an overwhelm-
ing majority of officers who vote for
the FOP as their collective bargain-
ing representative,” C_hester said.

In the past 10 years there have
been two PLRB sanctioned strikes
and three to four unsanctioned wal-
kouts or strikes by the campus
police, according to Chester, actions
he described as ”contrary to the by-
laws of the FOP.”

In March, 1979, the FOP Lodge 99
received its charter but existed solely
as a fraternal or social organization.
Then in June of I979, Chester,
representing the FOP, petitioned the
state labor board to hold herings to
make a determination as to whether
Pitt was an employer under Act I I I
and whether the campus police ful-I

filled the requirements of the act.
After a series of hearings the PLRB
determined that ‘Pitt was an
employer under Act I I I, and the the
campus police fulfilled their require-
ments of the act, functioning the
”traditional” way police function.

Then in December, -1980, the
PLRB ordered that an election be
held to determine which labor
organization would represent the
police. Wednesday’s election will
determine this.

”The FOP Lodge 99 is primarily
directed by its own membership with

very little influence by state and
national lodges," Chester said. "The

members of the lodge who are only
Pitt police will have the primary
influence on the direction of the
lodge’s activities.”

An election decision to accept the
FOP as the bargaining unit would be
a ”benefit to the police officers, and
to the people who the police officers

“so-called Rural Solidarity," he said

it was “blown out of proportion" by
the Western media. He said that
unrest among farmers and peasants

“Strikes have been limited to only

He added that he believes the Pol-

By BETH INGOLD
The Pitt News Staff Writer
Members of the National Organi-
zation for Women (NOW) went to
Washington last Wednesday to
lobby federal representatives and
Senators to vote against the pending
Human Life Amendment, which
would once again outlaw abortion
and some forms of contraception.

Carol McCullough. vice president
of Pennsylvania NOW, said Con-
gressional Caucas was held in the
morning, followed by a short rally
and lobbying.

“We feel that this amendment is
very much against women‘s‘rights.
The lives of women of childbearing
age would be severely affected,”
McCullough said. “The object of,it
_(the amendment) is to control
women’s lives. it would forbid a
woman to make a choice in the most
basic parts of her life.”

“It’s a national lobby day so there
will be people coming from across
the country,” McCullough added. A
crosssection of organizations which
have human rights as one of their
goals, such as the American Civil
Liberties Union and Planned Par-
enthood, will‘~also be participating,
according to McCullough.

extraordinary maintenance, such as
(for) a fire," Jackson said. “if it
doesn’t, then there is another ques-
tion as to whether or not we are
responsible for extraordinary main-
tenance caused by their negligence.

“What we're dealing with is an old
contract that dates back to the six-
ties. and a lot of things have gotten
muddy» over the years," Jackson

Mary Ellen Tunney, PA vice pres-
ident of the National Abortion
Rights Action League (NARAL),
said many NARAL members ‘are
involved in the Washington trip as
well.

“NARAL of Pennsylvania
believes very strongly that abortion
is a private matter, and we support

the I973 Supreme Court decision'—

which made it legal."

The 1973 Supreme court case, Roe
vs. Wade, declared that abortion
was a private matter between a
woman and her doctor.

“There are several versions of the
Human Life Amendment. The one
that they (pro-life groups) are push-
ing most is called the Paramount
Human Life Amendment,” McCul-
lough said.

This amendment states: “The
paramount right to lifeis vested in
each human being from the moment
of fertilization without regard to
age, health or condition of
dependencyf’ '

woman. Some forms of contracep-
tion that permit fertilization but pre-
vent implantation, such as the
intrauterine device and some forms
of the pill, would also be banned.

McCullough said that no form of
human life amendment is accepta-
ble. “There is no such thing in
NOW’s view as an acceptable
human life amendment. Even if
exceptions such as the life of the
woman, incest or rape are thrown in,
it will not be acceptable to us. We
demand control over our bodies.”

“The anti-abortion people have
been marching on Washington for
eight years now and they’ve only
managed to get half as many suppor-
ters as NOW, ” said Tunney. “The
largest demonstrations in Washing-
ton for women's rights attracted
100,000 supporters. ”

Tunney pointed out that young
women today have never expe-
rienced illegal abortion. “Since they
(young women) became sexually
active, abortion service has been
available to them,” Tunney
explained. “The idea of abortion

Jackson went on to say that, at

this time, it would be too difficult to

safety technician said.

According io Rapp, who said he
thinks the investigation will prove

deﬁnite causation, one of the rea-

sons for the delay in finding the fire’s
source is because the Tower C. jani-

tors unknowingly disposed some of

the burnt parts needed for testing.

farfetched that it could never
happen, when, in fact, abortion has
onlygbeen legal for eight years.

“Young peope have to be made
aware of the fact that this is all recent
history and it’(legal abortion) canbe
reversed unless we do something
about it.”

McCullough said she belieyes the
trips to Washington are very effec-
tive. She attributes NOW’s 1979 suc-
cess in gaining the-three-and-a-half
year extension for ratiﬁcation of the
Equal Rights Amendment to inten-
sive lobbying. ‘

'“The anti-abortion people have

ters as NOW,” said Tunney.'“The
largest demonstration in Washing-
ton for women’s rights attracted

“Every poll that has been done
shows that the overwhelming-major-
ity of people in this country feel that
abortion should remain legal. The
only reason that this minority (pro-
life groups) has been successful is
because they are a one-issue group.
They don’t care about anyone else.”

McCullough said she did not per-
ceive the 1980 general election as a
swing of the country to the right.

“I think by no means did the coun-
try give a stamp of approval to such
things as the Human Life Amend-
ment, anti-ERA, or the whole right-
wing platform.

“In fact, in Nov. I980, NOW had
the biggest single-month’s member-
ship growth that we’Ve ever had in
our history, We had 12,000 people
join nationwide in November. We
think that is attributable to Reagan

winning. People became very much 4»

Information on upcoming activi-
ties to prevent thepassage of the
anti-abortion amendment can be
obtained from NOW\(92l-7272) or
NARAL (276-0191).

Tunney said the best parallel to
illegal abortion is Prohibition.

“If abortion becomes illegal, it is‘

going to be a disaster. It wouldlmean .

a lot of dead women. Restrictive
abortion laws don’t save fetuses,
they only kill women,” she said. I

Josh: Social lss

By TIMOTHY P. MCCABE

‘‘I‘m probably the first person to
be censored in the history of this
country,” proclaimed Josh McDo-
well, the wily recruit of Campus
Crusade for Christ.

McDowell, slated to speak last
night, today and tomorrow at 8 p.m.
in Benedum, Lawrence and Soldiers
and Sailors halls respectively, claims
he is not only a speaker but an enter-
tainer who was “born in Michigan at
a young age in a good old town
where they had to widen the street to
paint a line down the center."

Last night’s topic was “Resurrec-
tion; Where you can’t keep a good
man down.” Tonight it’s “Future
Tellers, What you don’t know, may
hurt you" and he‘ll wrap it up with
“Maximum Sex or, Is love still pos-
sible in a junkie world?"

Some campus critics have labeled
McDowell as a fraud and mislead-
ing, but McDowell promised he’ll
speak on the topic the way it’s
advertised.

“I’ll speak on maximum sex,’
McDowell challenged. “Some peo-
ple might interpret that as an orgasm
between the sheets. Others might
interpret it as a full relationship.
After they hear me they’ll see how I
interpret it:” .

But McDowell, who,will open the "

“I don’t mind hecklers at all,”

there were more ofthem. It makes it
more alive.”_

For McDowell, doing homework
means two hours of research for
every minute of his speech. “l’m sen-

you say. It affects peoples thinking,”
McDowell added. ’

“Almost all of the problems that we
face today, intellectually, morally,
socially, can be solved through a

is to go to heaven ‘and take as many

“I just referred to him as ‘you

through a smile. “It really backﬁred .
because the campus newspaper got
behind it and they had to have lawy-
ers monitoring the lecture,” he said.

The message provokes vehement

' response from some people for rea-

sons like background, prejudices, .
and negative experiences and pride,
according to McDowell.

“Also moral problems; Let’s'face
it, Christ is-goingto affect every area
of your life including moral relation-

Furthermore, he concluded that

The _l960’s were a time of social
upheaval, of idealists
changing the fabric ofa culture. But
with the l970’s came realization and
disappointment; solutions formed
too slowly, and activism gave way to
the “me generation." .

Ironically, a philosophy nurtured
in the 60’s and eventually oversha-

V dowed by yoga, pet rocks and medi-

-in objectivism in the»60’s after read-
ing Rand’s novels. I

Rand, who was born in Russia

with Rand's philosophy was Cyn-

Inflation «

Simply by predicting the factors which inﬂuence the
governor’s annual appropriation recommendation,
Pitt could have forseen this year’s loss in anticipated
revenue, enacted their cost—cutting measures, and not
have to blame inﬂation as the sole‘“culprit” for the_
tuition hike.

So, then, what or who are these financial culprits
who would so recklessly endanger the economic well-
being of the University of Someplace Special?

The State Board of Education, for one, appears as a
likely candidate for the job. This year the board
decided for the first time in its history to decide against
recommending specific appropriations for the state
and state-related institution, suggesting instead that.
the governor direct the funding into the Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance Act (PHEAA), the
state’s student loan program.

Normally, the board’s appropriation recommenda-

tion is approximated to the Holy Gospel by the gover-
nor. Last ‘year, the board recommended that Pitt’s
state appropriation be increased by 5.6 percent over

the previous year’s funding, the same figure adopted.

by the governor.

What this all points to is that ifPitt and the adminis-
trations ofthe other state and state-related schools had
kept their ears open to the proceedings of the board
leading up to their otherwise ill-fated decision, then
Pitt and the others could have sent out their high-
salaried lobbists to sway the board into making a
favorable appropriations recommendation to the

- gOVCI'I'lOI'.

What other culprits besides inﬂation added to the
minimal increase in state appropriations?

The federal government, no less. No, make that the
Democratic Carter administrations federal govern-
ment which discontinued $110 million in federal
revenue’-sharing grants to Pennsylvania. Although

this amount is only a drop in the bucket of Thom-

burgh’s $12.6 billion‘fiscal plan, it is $110 million
normally used to help the state’s general education
program. . .  _

“ In this case, if Pitt had anticipated this cut infederal
revenue grants, recognized the fact that the- state was

going to have to make up the loss in part through state
appropriations, _then Pitt could have pleaded its case
early, either to the federal government or to the state,
before the appropriations were made.

There is one more pre-game strategy Pitt could have
attempted before being spoon-fed this year’s appropri-
ation request: targeting its lobbying efforts toward the
members of the state government with the governor’s
ear rather than scattering theseefforts across the realm
of political power we euphemistically refer to as
Harrisburgf ,

These causes and strategies to avoid losses in antici-
pated state appropriations are extremely crucial in the
final analysis of the tuition hike which will take place
next year. If we see that cuts in appropriations are not
solely the result of the demon inﬂation, the the stu-
dents and Pitt's administrators will be in a better posi-
tion to avoid annual tuition hikes.

Inﬂation, due to its catch-all definition, has become
a cure-all medicine to thwart protests over tuition
hikes. But once the thin veil separating inﬂation and
actual as opposed to percept_ual causes is lifted, then
we’ll find our way out of the economic dilemma," and
pick up some additional appropriations and lower

. tuition along the way.

Another Vietnam? U.S. Supp

By DAVID HOUSTON

The United States today is sup-
porting and participating in the
slaughter ofSalvadorian people that
isjust as brutal, immoral and illegiti-
mate as our activities in Vietnam
from 1963 to I975. lt is perhaps

I more depressing and appaling as we

have the recent experience of Viet-
ham‘ to remind us of the carnage and
the national division and disruption
which accompanied it.

At this time El Salvador is ruled
by a ruthless junta which is nothing

I more than a military dictatorship

which our State Department calls
“moderate." ln the past year and a
‘half the junta has lost almost all of
the limited political support which it
had. Today it represents only the
most reactionary and facist ele— /
ments, certain large business inter?
ests and the military, less than 20%
of the political spectrum of
Salvador.

Thisjunta and its associated para-

. military groups or “death squads"

.have been responsible for over 90%

-A of the approximately 10,000 Salvad-

../

l

iorians killed in I980. The violence

and “disrespect for human rights“
have their origin in this government
and its military apparatus.
Thisjunta could not survive on its
own, and it is our enormous military

— aid whiehenables it to continue its

bloody reign. As the deathsin Salva-
dor have mounted, so has U.S.-mil-

if _ itary aid the Junta. ln 19.79 and I980

   
   

  

~i_t amounted‘ to about $2.5 million,

     

$l0.5 million or more. In addition
we have sent out own personnel con-
sisting of helicopter training teams
and counter insurgency planning
and assistance teams. We have had
these “advisors" in Salvador since
October I980.

U.S. personnel have also been
important in directing and carrying
out the “land reform" program in
Slavador. Like the "Land to the
Tiller“ program in Vietnam and
directed by the same American
“expert," the names of peasants who
desire land are collected andat the
same time information on those
active in organizing in the farms and
fields is gathered. Thousands of the
peasants have been murdered as a
direct result of the “Land to the
Tiller (Salvador)" program, and
manyu\of the 25,000 refugees from

Salvador in' the past year ﬂed rather .

than participate in the bloody “land
reform.“ In short, it is little more
than a front to permit the Junta to
murder its opposition.

The U.S. State Department and
Junta claim that the violence is
caused by left and right extremists,
but no other responsible investiga-
tors or authorities have found this to
begthe case.The Salvadorian Church
has made it «clear that the violence
originates with government security
forces and the right wing ‘“death
squads." The great church leader

QUESTIONS ON FROSTBITE.
’ FROSTNIPANDCOLDINJURY

WHAT IS IT?
Injury from cold results from loss
_ of heat from body parts, principally
exposed parts (ears, nose, cheeks,

fingers, toes, etc.). Frostbite refers to
actual freezing, frostnip to less
severe injury, and cold injury to
damage at above freezing
temperatures. ,_
WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?

Cold injury without freezing tends
to result in swollen, red, painful
body parts. The victim is commonly
not aware of frostbite until he sees
his pale, numb skin.
WHAT FIRST AID
APPLY?
Outside:

CAN I

When pale, numb skin is first

observed. simple rewarming is often
enough. A warm hand on a nose or
cheek or ear, warm breath or armpit
for cold fingers, or a friend’s warm
abdomen for cold, numb feet will
often prevent more serious prob-
Iems. DO NOT rub the frozen area
with hands or snow. This may make
the injury worse.

In a Warm Environment:

Rewarm the frozen part rapidly.
Warm water is best, ‘temperature
between l04° - l08° F. as measured
by a thermometer. ' The water
temperature should never be tested

with the frozen part and should feel
warm, not hot, to a normal hand or
elbow at room temperature. Allow
the immersion without bumping the
injured part. Rewarm until the
entire part is flushed; the final few
minutes may be intensely painful.
—Avoid dry heat-fire, heater,
hot water bottle; burns may
result.

—Avoid injury to the thawed

part.
—Clean gently with mild soap

or detergent and water, and.

cover with sterile or freshly
laundered dressings./t

——Avoid weight bearing and

the use of alcohol and

tobacco.
WHEN SHOULD I SEE A
.DOCTOR? '

Competent medical attention is
absolutely necessary for any but the
mildest frostbites; if blistering or
gangrene occurs, see a doctor.

PREVENTION - ’ ’
-Minimize heat loss from all part

of the body. In extreme cases, this

means covering all possible parts

expertise. This relationship has not
in tha past, nor is it presently, with-

rout problems. Commonly, the
Health Services professionals are
interviewed only to be misquoted or
“cut" resulting in oblique accounts
of the medical facts.

Most recently, two such episodes
‘occurred. Dr. Pam Bowen, medical
director of the Health Service, gave

she had given up valuable time only
to read a short article virtually tell-

not been retracted, nor reported
accurately, even after repeated
attempts to contact the News staff.

Shortly after the misrepresenta-

the guidance of the SHS, initiated
HEALTHLINE, a weekly question

Rhode Island games. Everyone fig-
ured and almost expected the Panth-
ers to blow another tight one.

But the script was re-written and
McMillian cooly sank both free
throws and Pitt eeked out a 73-70
win. To winning coach Roy Chip-
man the game, hopefully , marked
the end of tough losses and marked
the beginning of positive things for
his team.

“We feel pretty good right now.
We've got a tough stretch up ahead
of us and the team is starting to pick
up some confidence. We shot 75 per-
cent from the line today and that’s a
heck of a lot better than what we’ve
been shooting."

Only 3,235 fans showed up at the
Field House to watch the contest as
Cleveland State surely is not a name
team. They may have not been a
name team but CSU, make no mis-
take, was a good team. How good?
They were good enough to have
beaten Old,Dominion. They were
good enough to have had eight pro
scouts watching their jitterbug

Pan therette Swimmers Meet Princeton Tonighti

By SEAN BARNES

Pitt News Sports Writer

The Pantherettes, under head
coach Dick Bradshaw, meet with
Princeton tonight to see if Pitt can
make it seven wins in a row. Prin-
ceton is the defending Eastern
Champions, having beaten Pitt, the
78-79 Eastern Champions, the pre-

_ .‘ vious year. Both Pitt and Princeton
» _ were-tied with only one loss until last

week when Brown overcame Prin-

 ceton. This will be Pitt's toughest

meet this season due to Princeton's
strength all around. Princeton's
national breastroke finalist Char-

lotte Tiedemann will give even. Pitt's _ ,

national breastroke qualiﬁers a race.

 

 

guard Frank Edwards. They were
good enough to have a I3-6 record.

Ambushed last year by this same
team, the Panthers were determined
not to let the same thing happen
again this year. Sam Clancy, who’
was to end up with I6 points and 16
rebounds. summed up the team’s
feeling going into the game.

“We knew they were good and
have had this game on their minds
for awhile. We were ready for this

19

0116.

The game began as if it was going
to be a track contest as both teams
ran up and down the court at a fur-
ious pace. Pitt held the lead through-
out the half and in fact were only
down once by one point at 2I-20.
Leading the way was Sam Clancy,
who came thru with 10 first half '
points and 10 rebounds. The senior
appeared determined to prove to the
scouts that they had come to look at
the wrong player.

Although he was well aware ofthe
scouts, Clancy did not attribute the
performance to their presence, but
to his new leadership role on the M
team.

‘‘I’m trying to be a leader and to
take control of things.'When the
pressure gets tight we’ve been caught
sleeping lately and we’ve got to
change that.”

Clancy inspired play paved the
way for a 37-32 halftime lead. The
game was still very much in doubt as
the Vikings had shot a mere 37%
from the field and /were still within 5.
The second half started off much
different however.

Whether it was the halftime talk:
or just their own doing the Panthers
came as if they were shot out of a
cannon. On the strength of three
Carlton Neverson buckets and two
by Steve Beatty and Lennie McMil-
lian the Panthers built a 55-40 bulge
with l3:l0 remaining and were
threatening to turn the game into a
blowout. Dwayne Wallace, who fin- .
ished up with I2 points, explained
why the Panthers got off to such a
big lead. '

“The first 8 minutes of each half

‘are very important and we try to

play hard‘ and with intensity. You
don't want to fall behind early and
play catchup." He also went on to
add, “We’re not a bad team and we
haven’t played bad. We just have to
hit our free throws down the stretch

' and we'll be okay.”

Whether they got careless or CSU
started hitting their shots the Panth-

erslostthatlead.TheVikingsslowly came through with 14 points, is

new freshman.Theirdivingteam has
also expanded for the better.

But the Pantherettes under Brad-
shaw will be ready, having just.
defeated their last three opponents,
Penn State, Maryland, and West
Virginia by scores of I I 1-29, I I0-39,
and I09-40 respectively. Theilatest
win over WVU atTrees pool left Pitt
with five national cuts as well as
more Eastern qualifying times.

From the WVU meet, Jan Ujevich
made two nationalqualifying times
in the 50 and 200 breastroke. ,Uje-
vich also won the I00 IM, giving her
a triple win ineet as well as the I2th
fastest breastroke time in the nation.‘

Dwayne Wal/ace was one opfifive Panthers in -double figures during Pitt’s
73-70 win over Cleveland State Saturday. g t "

chipped away with a couple of three
point plays and soon were back in it
at 68-64. Wallace attributed the loss
of the lead to “lack of concentra-
tion" while Neverson said it was
CSU’s talent which brought them
back. Whatever it was, the Panthers
now had a ball game on their hands‘
and a loss was very much a reality.

The Panthers hung on however,
as Steve Beatty hit 'a free throw and
McMillian canned three of four
from the charity stripe. Beatty, who

Heof1’s time of 17:00.88 in the I650
free (66 laps), not~only destroyed
Pitt's team record by 32 seconds, but
also qualified her for nationals by
over 9 seconds and leaves her the
fourth fastest I650 swimmer in the
nation. Heon also made the national
I000 yard cutofftime against Mary-

' land the week before. Heon won the

200 back and was on the winning 400
yard free relay. «

Double winners for Pitt included
Amy Jackson in the 200 ﬂy and 400
free relay, and Nancy Henry in the
50 fly and 400 free relay. Pitt not
only won all but two events, but also

-swept first, second. and third in four ‘

of them, the 200 free, the 50 fly, and
the 9n_e and three meter diving.-. ..

‘‘I’m getting used to thetcollege

Clyde Vaughn Is Not Another Sa Clancy  

By AMIN GHOSSEIN
Pitt News Sports Writer

When Sam Clancy enrolled here

A— four years ago, basketball faithfuls

.‘\'

V

were predicting a new era for Pitt
basketball. Clancy was “The Fran-
chise" and the man who put Pitt
back on the basketball map. It‘s no
secret that when people mentioned
Pitt basketball, Sam Clancy was
also quickly mentioned.

Well, the Clancy era is almost

I over. Pitt’s basketball program has

been competitive but yet has not
attained the heights predicted of it.

With Clancy’s imminent gradua-

. tion, Pitt will have to look for a

player to replace him. Actually,
replacing a Sam Clancy is impossi-
ble, but easing his loss and bringing
some of his qualities is not. Clancy
provided Pitt with scoring, excite-
ment and a mastership in the art of
rebounding. Pitt, however, may
have found one such player. His
name is Clyde Vaughn.

He will have to fill some pretty big
shoes. "Aside from looks, where
Vaughn bears an uncanny resemb-
lance’ to Clancy, the comparison
stops. At'6’4”, Vaughn is smaller and
although the thick—thighed build is
still there, is a better shooter and in
fact plays a different type of game.
Whereas Clancy is at his best near
the hoop, Vaughn can‘hit a 20 foot
jumper with no problem. While
Clancy dominated the boards,
Vaughn has to work hard for
rebounds and cannot soar like
“Slam Bam.’’.' ‘

When Roy Chipman took over

Pitt basketball he also took over sev--

eral problems. For beginners, there
were the Tim Grgurich loyalists who

took unkindly to anyone replacing‘

their man. Then there was the fact
that he was inheriting a team which

was _losing its three top players._.,If_

Chipman wanted to put Pittiin the
big time he had. to bring the quality
players to a school previously
avoided by most blue-chip high
school players. Chipman wasted no
time.

Chipman quieted the Grgurich
fans and continued his commitment
to big time basketball by luring a
big-time player. From New Rochelle

_ (N. Y.) High School, where he broke

all of the school scoring records ’s
and had his jersey retired, Chip‘
manplucked Clyde Vaughn.

In an area which has produced the
likes of Rodney and Scooter
McCray, Gus and Ray Williams,
Earl Tatum and countless others,
Vaughn was the dominant player
and in fact the state’s leading scorer
ahead of North Carolina—bound
Sam Perkins and Matt Dougherty.
The darling of DePaul and Ala-
bama, Vaughn chose Pitt. Why?

“Seth Greenberg told me he’d
make me a great player by working
on all of my weaknesses and I
believed him,” said Vaughn.

Greenberg, the assistant coach,
had known Vaughn for two years
because he ran the Five-Star camp at
Robert Morris College. It was at this
camp, where Vaughn was the MVP
one year, that.the two got to know
each other so well. With Greenberg’s
cajoling, Vaughn choose Pitt.

He was expected to step right in
and become the force hecwas in high
school. It all appeared to be going
well, especially after the first exhibi-
tion game against St. Mary’s where
he canned I9 points.

But, Vaughn soon discovered that

high school basketball‘ is a far cry
from the college game. His weak-_
nesses, which had been overlooked
orjust had not surfaced against infe-
rior players, were becoming evident
against superior players. This did
not bother Vaughn, who rarely goes

without an ear-to-ear grin, and who-

realizes that
always be had.
He was beaten out by senior Len-

improvement can

"nie McMillian, who was the quicker
and better ball;h_andler._o_f.t_h7e.two. 

McMillian, "the more experienced
player, provided that extra that only
veterans can give. Chipman, also

. wanted to handle Vaughn carefully.

“You. can’t throw a freshman in

there and expect him to perform

well." said Chipman. “It’s not fair to
him or the team. he’s going to be
nervous and edgy. You have to ease
his progress."

Keeping true to his belief, Chip-
man nursed Vaughn along as he kept
the freshman as his 6th man. And he
came through with a few double-
figure games. Then came his big
break. McMillian was suspended for
a few games and Vaughn got the
start and he responded. Against
Indiana (Pa.), Vaughn scored 17 and
over the Christmas holiday he
scored 29.against James Madison in
the Virginia Tech tournament and
named to the All-tournament team.
In that game he shot a sizzling I4-I8
from the field. A’

g After a mild slump, Vaughn came
back with a 20 point performance
against Delaware State. In that

.game .he displayed his ability to

\\

score from the parameter with a
’deadly jumper, and from under-
neath the boards as well.

His-shooting ability is well docu-
mented. Mount Vernon (N. Y.)
High School coach Tony Fiorentino
whose teams have been in the top I0
in the country for four straight
years, claimed, that‘ Vaughn was
“one of the five best shooters in the
nation.”

Dubbed . merely as a shooter
Vaughn surprised many in the,Dela-
ware State game. Vaughn, however,
was not one of those surprised.

“I’m not a shooter, I’m a scorer.
There‘s a difference. I can score from
anywhere,” said Vaughn.

This label has been the base for
some criticism that states‘ that
Vaughn cannot play against a man-
to-man defense. I

“I don’t know why or who came
up with that notion. It just is not
true," he said.

So, the talent for sure is there.

Vaughn, has shown some brilliance,

but there is work to be done. And no

,._one. is ,quic_ker,,.tos,.,admit that then

Vaughn himself, ‘ .

f‘Over the summer, I plan to lose
l0 pounds to acquire» some leg
quickness,” he said. “I also want to
improve my ball-handling so I can
play guard in the future.” I

Love is
giving her ﬂowers on
Valentines Day

By MIKE MALLINGER

The Pitt News Staff Writer

Amid the confusion and physical _

carnage of a long basketball season,
basketball star Carlton
Neverson emerges as a player who
can look down the road to possible
pro offers while staying close to the
ground.

Neverson challenged his next
opponent, Penn State, before letting
himselfjump on the ﬂying carpet to
multi-year pro contracts.

“Right now I’m playing it game by
game," Neverson said. “About look-
ing forward
now...we have too many things to
look forward to this season."

Guards like Neverson generally
are not expected to muscle their way
to the boards from outside for
rebounds but nonetheless Neverson
averages five rebounds per game.

“You’ve got to stick it out with the
big boys," he said. A ‘

The team, Neverson asserts, is one
cohesive family. He said that close-
ness was necessary, in light ofcoach—
ing changes during the off-season
and denies dissatisfaction on the
team from seco_nd stringers who do
not get the gameexperience Never-
son does.

Basketball players ..are different
from the average Pitt student, Nev-
erson added.

“lt’s tough to look at it like anyb-
ody else looks at it,” he said. “We’re
not average students. We’re differ-
ent individuals because of what we
do. We're here to learn but«we’re
here also here to play ball.”

Neverson’s *-concentration is

:

to the pros right-

Order early to avoid‘Feb. 14th rush  .

divided between sports and his
studies. .

“I can’t let up on the books
because that’s why I’m in school...to
get my degree,” he said. “It would be

' a total waste to me ifl finish a great

ball career and didn’t have a degree.” -

With the pro basketball /season
underway, Neverson cannot help
looking toward a possible draft.
Now he sees his chances as slim.

“If I get.drafted as I hope I will,
I’m going to give it my best shot,”
Neverson said. “And ifl don’t make
it and l gave it my best, all 1 can say is
that I tried. If I do get that break

' that’s going to be the greatest thing

in the world.”

Basketball, Neverson added, has
given him the opportunity to meet
influential people’ in the city and he

expects that this fact will give him
advantages “down the stretch.“

“By showing them some of my tal-
ents off the court, they can probably
help me out," Neverson said.
“There‘s so many things going on
and the world‘s moving so fast right
now, that if you don‘t have any
brains people try to walk over you.”

Neverson sees his coach" as a sur-
rogate father.

“Your coach has got to be like
your father away from home," he
said. “He’s got to be the man who
keeps you together when you’re feel-
ing down.” V

This relationship occurs more
often with younger players who have ’
not decided on a direction at Pitt, he
added. I

Pantherettes Finish Fifth In Indoor Meet

By MARIE HUFF

-’- The Pitt News Sportswriier

The fifth annual Pitt Indoor
Track Invitational was a success for
the Pantherettes. The women
tracksters finished a fifth place over-
all, just two points behind fourth-
place Kent State. Maryland
repeated as queens of the extrava-
ganza, retaining the title they had
won last year.

Senior Gwen Murray led the Pan-
therette charge. Murray ran the 440-
yard dash in 56 seconds flat, settingia

.\ new Pitt record. The time also

earned the speedster a first-place fin-
ish. The quartet, composed of Val-
erie Strasser, Pam Gearing, Sally
Higgins and Murray, finished
second with a time of 9:36.3. This

also set a new Pitt record. The
record performance earned the four
a trip to the Eastern Champion-
ships.

“Strasser, Higgins, and Gearing
all ran splits that were their personal
best,” said Coach Alfreeda Goff.
“The girls shaved 10 seconds off
their previous best time, and we’re
excited about that.”

Strasser barely missed a Pitt
record in the one-mile run. The
impressive freshman ran a 5217.6
mile, good enough for fourth place.

Kathy Dvorsak led the field con-
tingent with a third—place finish in
the pentathlon. Close behind was
teammate Cheryl Williams in fourth
place. As expected, Juanita Alston
of Maryland won the event with
3826 points,‘smashing the old meet
