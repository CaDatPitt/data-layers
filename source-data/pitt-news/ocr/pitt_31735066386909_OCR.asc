Administrators
oppose Casey's
tuition program

By Matt Groff

Asst. News Editor

Pitt’s administration will oppose Gov. Robert
Caseys plan to combat the rising cost of tuition at
state—related and state-owned universities.

The plan included in Casey’s budget, the Tuition
Challenge Grants Program, offers the state-spon-
sored universities $200 of additional funding for
each full—time undergraduate student enrolled if the
university complies with certain requirements.

However, Pitt administrators said they see several
faults with the proposal which would give Pitt a
total of nearly $4.2 million more than the state has
appropriated to it for the next ﬁscal year.

Dennis P. McManus, assistant to the chancellor
and Pitt's chief Harrisburg lobbyist, said one reason
the administration opposes the plan is because it is
based on full-time undergraduate enrollment,
according to the Feb. 17, 1994 issue of the
I./1/z[L*ersit~).-i T imes. The plan does not compensate
for Pitt’s relatively high number of part-time and
graduate students.

According to the article, the administration said it
believes “the plan has set unrealistically low limits
on tuition” and gives the state too much control
over tuition, education and general appropriations.

The state’s tuition program requires, among other
things, that universities keep tuition hikes at or
below 4.5 percent. If Pitt exceeds the 4.5 percent
cap, it will only receive $9,000 above the amount
originally appropriated.

The administration is also investigating the possi-
ble effect that this plan may have on costs such as
the student activities fee. The Student Government
Board, the governing body of undergraduates, has
already studied and approved a fee increase from
$52 to $40. Such an increase may not be in compli-
ance with the state’s tuition program.

“We know there is a cap and we know there is an
S8 increase proposal,” SGB Advisor Joyce Giangarlo
said. “But at this point we do not know whether the
cap affects the activities fee increase.”

Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor and other Pitt
aciministrators will announce their position on the
matter at the Pennsylvania Senate Appropriations
Committee hearings next month in Harrisburg.

Clarke says legay needs refound

By Bryan Bender
Staff‘ Writer

The legacy of Marcus Garvey, an
early twentieth—century leader in
the struggle for African nationalism,
has been lost. And unless it is
regained, the freedom struggle for
all Africans will never be realized.

This was the message of historian
John Henry Clarke, whose lecture
in the William Pitt Union Assembly
Room last night was part of the _, \\
Black Action Society’s commemo— '0 . 
ration of Black History Month. by 

Garvey, born in Jamaica in the . 
late nineteenth century, traveled ‘
the world expousing his Pan-
African views and the need for a
return to the African continent by
all Africans, wherever they may be.

street of dreams and we must con-
tinue,” Clarke said.

Of all that has been taken away
from Africans, according to Clarke,
the most important is the concept
of nation. And the idea of blacks
returning to Africa is not new by
any means. It was around more
than 100 years before the emer-
gence of Garvey, he said.

“Before we went back physically
[if temporarilyl we went back men-
tally.”

Business School brings Monte Carlo night for charity

By Rebecca Baker
Staff Writer

A dream date, a trip to Florida and a cruise to the
Caribbean will all be given away at the Katz Graduate
School of Business’ Red Cross Charity Ball this Friday
night.

One lucky graduate student will win the round-trip
ﬂight to the Sunshine State. KGBS plans to auction
off and “sell” the trip to the person with the most win-
nings from the games, program organizer Todd Mason
said.

The charity ball will be “a Monte Carlo type of party
with gambling — the legal kind,” said Mason, who
serves as vice-president of the Student Executive Board
at KGSB.

Graduate students attending the party will pay $10

Those who do well at the tables can win a dream
date with one of the men or women on the auction
block. The “winner” receives dinner at a Mount

Even if a person loses at the casino games, everyone
has an even shot at winning a Caribbean cruise donat-

The trip will serve as the door prize of the night, and

“There will also be real small prizes given away, like

The charity ball is not open to everyone, however.
Only graduate students and guests over the age of 21
may attend the event.

“We can’t really say there’s going to be alcohol
there,” Mason said, “but if we say ‘over 21.”’

The amount of proceeds donated to the Red
Cross depends on how much money KGSB raises
over the cost of expenses.

Mason said he hopes to sell the majority of the 500
tickets available.

Continued from page 1

Clarke pointed to several
means for reaching this nation-
hood.

First, blacks must focus on
themselves by creating jobs and
opportunities for all, especially
here in America.

Black children must be told,
“If you love yourself you do not
put poison in your veins.”
Clarke said they must be
encouraged and given strength
in all endeavors.

For too long black children
have just been sent to school

with white children but have
not been told they are as intelli-
gent, he added.

For Clarke, what he terms
“essential selfishness” is in
order. Africans should look out
for their own interests to secure
survival.

Clarke also cited numerous
historical figures and events
which led to the need for libera-
tion, as expoused by many
leaders such as Martin Luther
King, Malcolm X and others.

He pointed to Christianity and
European colonialism as cul-

prits in the attack on African
culture, language and‘ religion
of centuries past, things which
also led to the slave trade.

But Clarke did not only point
the finger at whites. According
to Clarke, many leaders in the
black community have taken
money under false pretenses
and given fancy but empty
speeches preying on the misery
of African people.

Clarke said-blacks must take
the messages of their true lead-
ers in the context of all of black
history, not just that of the

LY...

twentieth century, to fully
understand their meaning.

He said blacks must not be
afraid to speak of Africa and the
desire to return and embrace
their ancient culture and tradi-
tions. Blacks must be proud of
all they have accomplished.

Clarke credits the founding of
the principles of mathematics,
the invention of the means for
mass production of shoes, as
well as many other technologi-
cal advances, to black people
around the world.

thought, Clarke pointed to the
existence of socialist societies in
Africa “before Europeans had
shoes.”

Clarke detailed in his speech
the life’s work of Garvey, the
strides he made and the aware-
ness he kindled among African
people across the globe. He
spoke of the level to which
Garvey inﬂuenced many leaders
in the black liberation move-
ment as well as leaders in gen-
eral.

And although Garvey’s efforts
to return many of African
descent to Africa weren’t
accomplished, his dream was
real and he had a plan. This is
something Clarke said he thinks
Africans of today have betrayed.

Clarke concluded by telling
his audience that to build an
African nation all blacks must
unite along all political and reli-
gious lines in honor of all the
great leaders in black history.

“We were royal once and can
be royal again,” he said.

Nursing

Continued from page 1

Also, seven teaching hospitals
are within walking distance from
Pitt’s campus, which Albrecht
said is “virtually unheard of” at
other schools.

Nursing students also work in
Oakland, Highland and
Aspinwall Veterans Affairs hospi-
tals. John Clochesy, assistant
dean for Clinical Affairs, said the
strength of the local hospitals
ends up being the strength of the
university’s nursing program.

Students in the School of
Nursing study nursing from the
standpoints of theory and clinical
experience. The first year is
devoted solely to theory.
Students use materials like CD
Roms, interactive videos and
medical models to learn the
basics of patient care.

According to Albrecht, the
Learning Resource Center allows
students to gain experience with
everyday tasks like changing
linen and bathing patients.

She said students are given the
opportunity to learn anatomy
and physiology visually with
models and a carpet that stu-
dents walk on to trace the path
of blood through the heart.
Students are also able to analyze
and participate in research with
hospital professionals.

Small class sizes and individual
attention are crucial to student

learning in both the Learning ,

Resource Center and in clinical
work done in the hospitals.

Theory lectures may contain up
to 120 people, but clinical classes
are very small and personalized,
Albrecht said. The School of
Nursing has one faculty member
for every eight to 10 students.

According to Albrecht, the clin-
ical curriculum begins during the
student’s sophomore year.
During the first term, students.
perform community work, such
as doing health assessments for
the elderly. Beginning in the sec-
ond temr, students go into hospi-
tals and gradually take on more
and more responsibility in
patient care. In their junior year
students take four clinical units
that last seven-and-a—half weeks
each. Students experience V med-
ical, surgical, psychiatric, mater-
nity and pediatric nursing in the
clinical units.

Junior Rachel Kramer said
nursing students are responsible
for doing everything that the
patient needs to have done.

Kramefs clinical clay starts at 7
a.m. and ends at 3 p.m. She said
she usually assesses the patients
past and current conditions, per-
fomrs any care needed, such as
giving injections or medication
and then documents all of her
work.

Some other activities of the
junior year include observing
deliveries, caring for neonates
(newborn children), health
teaching and caring for intensive-
care patients. Students get expo-
sure to a wide variety of care
styles and are given a chance to
“test their wings,” said Albrecht.

During the senior year stu-
dents have a class called

Transitions to Professional
Practice, which allows them to
spend more time in an area that
especially interests them.
Students in this course work with
a staff nurse and "share” his or
her patients.

Albrecht and Clochesy empha-
sized the importance of students
being able to understand the dis-
ease process and pick up on
symptoms quickly. They stressed
that the theory part of the nurs-
ing program is just as important
as the clinical because medica-
tions and methods of treatment
may have already changed

somewhat by the time a student
graduates.

Clochesy compared under-
standing the problem- solving
process to learning how to drive.
If you know how to drive a
Chevy you’ll be able to figure out
how to drive a Ford, Clochesy
said.

Kramer described the nursing
program as very competitive and
challenging. Nursing students
deal with everything from AIDS
patients to victims of child abuse.
“You get so attached to your
patients,” Kramer said. “It’s so
different than other majors.”

Don't let money toll/e
Money makes the world go around, the world go

around, the world go around 

Pitt’s administration has the opportunity to show that

those words are merely a song and not necessarily the

truth.

Last year, Pitt formed a policy that went into effect on
July 1, a policy that we commended. The policy grant-
ed tuition and bereavement benefits to same-sex part-
ners of Pitt employees. By taking this step, the univer-
sity recognized that same-sex couples, who cannot
legally marry, should receive the same benefits as mar-
ried couples.

Of course, this decision sparked some criticism and
opposition. J

James Flaherty, a member of Pitt’s Board of Trustees,
called same-sex relationships “illicit” and said, “If peo-
ple want to live together, that’s their private life, but if
they want the university to pay for that privilege, then
I’m totally against it.”

But that didn’t keep University Senate Council or Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor from agreeing that
same-sex couples were no more privileged or illicit
than any other couple.

Now objections are coming from another, and often a
very persuasive sector, those people who donate
money to the university. Twenty people have sent let-
ters to Pitt saying they do not agree with extending
benefits to same—sex domestic partners and threatening
to punish Pitt by withholding their donations for the
new undergraduate business school (Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette). 0

Although these 20 people gave Pitt a combined total
of only $1,000 last year, Lawrence Weber, vice chancel-
lor for institutional advancement at Pitt, has expressed
concern. “It’s a serious issue  I’m not a worrier, but it
does concern me whenever people express themselves
by taking action not to support the university for one
reason or another” (Post—Gazette). ‘

Although $1,000 may not seem like a lot of cash for
the university to lose, it should not -matter how much
money these people are holding over Pitt’s head. Pitt is
trying to raise $25 million for the business school, but
this goal should not undermine the entire school’s
commitment to education. ‘

"It must be remembered that Pitt is not a business, it’s
a learning institution. In keeping with this, the univer-
sity should shun prejudice and passing judgement and
should be more concerned with education than with
appeasement.

The university has made a move that not every
school would be willing to make, and it should hold
firm to its decision. This policy concerns human rights
which should not be ignored because of the monetary
threats of those who wish to impose their morals on
others.

To be a 'Rushie' is to

I want to comment on a sec-
tion of the Perspective page
known as the Letters to the
Editor. I have particular con-
cern considering two letters
that were published recently.

The first letter proclaimed
that there was too many
“Rushie” perspective colum-
nists. Now seeing how me and
Dickensheets are about the
only things associated with The
Pitt News that can be described
as conservative, you can under-
stand why I took it a bit per-
sonally.

Now this isn’t the first time
I’ve heard conservatives be
described as “Rushie,” or “Rush
Wannabes.” So I asked myself,
why am I “Rushie?” What
makes a person be “Rushie” as
opposed to simply conserva-
tive? The views I hold now
were a part of me since I was
six years old. Maybe they
weren’t formulated or articulat-
ed as well, but they were still
there. They were definitely
there before I ever heard of
some guy named Rush
Limbaugh.

So I began to feel maybe it
isn’t my message that’s
“Rushie;” maybe it’s my pres-
ence. Well, I don’t look like
Rush, and you couldn’t tell that
from the printed page anyway.
Maybe it’s my presentation. But
it’s impossible to use song
slugs and funny facial expres-
sions through print also.

And then it hit me. I make
sense and I use facts. If there
are any two things that liberals
hate, they are common sense
and facts. That’s becah iebof the
simple -reason thatigg
sense tells us that we would be
a lot better off without big gov-
ernment, and facts let us know
for sure that we’d be better off.
That's probably the thing that
ticks liberals off the most with
people like Rush, Dickensheets
and myself.

We remember, and when we
don't remember, we research.
After all, that’s the only coin-
mon thread.

What if, by some definition, I

‘ .
IllOI'l

am “Rushie?” What would be so
wrong with that? Why does it
upset so many people (because
the writer of this article is not
alone) that two of the perspec-
tive writers are “Rushie?” Is that
too much for one campus
paper? Yeah, you’re probably
right. T hat’s way over our one
moderate quota. But, I just
thought that tricky First
Amendment thingy was still in
effect  silly me.
I just try to put my beliefs on
the paper in the most clear and
honest way. If that makes me

“Rushie,” well then I’ll just take
that little statement as a compli-
ment and leave at that.

The second letter worried me
a little bit more. It touted off
about how the perspective
page was full of all these arti-
cles that try to tell people what
to believe. They all deal with
one issue or the other — gun
control, abortion, this or that.
The letter then went on to state
how this was so irritating and
why did all these people feel
the need to force their opinions
on the rest of us through the
perspective pages.
' Now, if you’re reading this
article, I want you to go back
and read the last few state-
ments over again  Done?

Both of these letters point to
a problem that I’ve detected
with readers of The Pitt News.
(That’s right. Not only does The
Pitt News have its faults, but it’s
readers do as well.) Among
other things. there is a basic
misunderstanding about the
purpose of the Perspective

page.

 

be logical

Correct me if I’m wrong, but
aren’t the Perspective pages
there to provide us, the stu-
dents, with an opportunity to
voice our opinions on issues in
a constructive manner? Why is
it that people feel they are
being forced to hear opinions
that they disagree with? First of
all, a real student seeks out
new ideas and alternative
points ofview. How else can
you ever test the validity of
your own opinions? Secondly,
who strapped you down,
pulled back youreyelids and
forced you to read the
Perspective pages? You have a
pretty good feel by now of
what you’re going to get when
you see “By The Book.” I

A lot of people have said,
“You columnists are full of
questions, but.I never hear any
answers.” Once again, I ask
you what is the purpose of the
perspective page? First of all,
I’ve heard a great deal of sug-
gestions put forth on the per-
spective pages. Even if that
wasn’t the case, it’s not the
responsibility of the columnist
to resolve all the problems of
the world. We’re students, just
like yourselves, and of course
we don’t have all the answers.
If we did, why on Earth would
we be paying this much money
to come here? As perspective
writers, we are here to share
our beliefs with the remainder
of the campus. Guess what?
That’s the exact same thing you
do when you write letters —
share your opinion.

So now, all I question is, why
this sudden outb; ak against
the. "perspective  I‘ don’:
know. Maybe, I just haven’t
been here long enough to
know if it’s sudden or not. Why
are there so many “Rushie”
columnists — two? I guess the
freedom of expression only
applies to artists dealing with
the Pitt Program Council and
not conservative writers on a
campus paper.

Buried

Gerrod Abrams‘ buzzer-beater buried the Panthers, 80-77, for their sixth consecutive-defeat.

By Jason Brame
Sports Editor

In basketball, as in life, all things must
come to an end. Be it relationships or
expectations, those things we most cherish
seem to never last.

That time-tempered adage was given cen-
ter stage last night for Pitt as three seniors
stepped on the Field House ﬂoor for the
final time in Panther blue-and-gold.

More importantly, however, a last—second
rally and the chance to knock off a confer-
ence big—boy ended abruptly, falling dead
at Pitt’s feet with one nasty shot.

In a scene that will live in redemption his-
toiy, Gerrod Abrams drained a buzzer—beat-
ing three-pointer to boost the Boston
College Eagles to an 80-77 victory over the
Panthers, hard-luck losers  again.

“A lot of our games come down to last-
second shots,” Boston College guard
Malcolm Huckaby, who scored a game-high
24 points, said.

“We just kept fighting our way back. We
were just fortunate to get a win —— very,
very lucky.” ,

“I guess it just wasn’t in the cards,” Pitt
forward Orlando Antigua said.

Abrams’ game—breaker came after he
missed a pair of break-away layups with
less than 28 seconds left that could have
iced the game for the Eagles.

“I was happy that I got Abrams another
chance,” Boston College head coach Jim
O’Brien said.

“We said in the huddle, ‘Make us win this
time.’ I’1n not sure we wanted that shot, but
I’ll take it.”

“It was definitely a set play,” Abrams said.
“I was very fortunate to [O’Brien] that the
coaches believed in me and gave me anoth-
er opportunity.” ‘

The play was designed for Abrams just to
get the ball and slash to the hole, but when
Pitt guard Ahmad Shareef cut down the
baseline, Abrams had to shoot.

“I knew when I caught the ball I was

had [Shareef] beat because I thought he was
on my side, so I was going to take him

It’s as plain and simple

as that three—letter.word that
perfectly sums up senior-cap-
tain diver Sean Braud’s attitude.

“I hate losing more than any-

sucks, it’s No. 1 or nothing.

“It’s the L—word to me. The L-

 and best friend'llMa-ft
Brady. “He dives with his heart
and soul and gives his entire

Braud’s winning attitude has
propelled him to heights that
are not measured by the meters
of the diving board.

“That’s been part of the rea-
son for most of my success, is
my overwhelming urge to win,”
Braud said.

rounds. He is also one of the
cornerstones of Pitt’s swimming
and diving legacy of winning.

“I wouldn’t want to be any-
where else,” Braud said of Pitt’s
10 straight Big East titles. “To be
part of such excitement —— it’s
just the best.”

Ironically, diving wasn’t even
Braud’s first love —— baseball
was, and still is.

“Ever since I started playing
baseball, that was it," Braud
said. “I wanted to be the fastest
kid on the team, and I wanted
to be the best hitter.

“I wanted all the erial
things atfirst. Iwa‘ '  1 the
trophies, I wanted all the
awards, because if I got the
award, it meant I was the best
this day or the best this year.

“I just wanted to be No. 1,
and that’s the way I’m with div-
ing now.”

Baseball was not just a pass-
ing dream for Braud. In the last
month of his senior year of high
school, he had to decide
between baseball or diving.

His decision boiled down to

Yeah, that’s right, three years
of diving.

Braud didn’t start diving until
he was a sophomore in high
school. His high school didn’t
have a diving board until his
school moved to a different
pool.

“I was listening to the school

Evans can't den

Pitt has finally offered Paul
Evans a contract extension. It is
a three-year contract with a pro-
vision that would allow the uni-
versity to extend the term
another two years following the
1995-96 season. Speculation is
that he may not accept the offer.
Evans has lost recruits because
of his unknown status and has
undoubtedly been embarrassed
by the way ‘he has been treated.
But no matter what anyone
says, he will stay in Pittsburgh.

He will stay because of his
son and new house in Fox
Chapel. I have a feeling that
Evans’ family will be foremost
in his mind when he makes a
decision.

Evans has received a lot of
ﬂak about being a poor coach.
His teams have frequently been
called underachievers.

But what about this little fact?
The last three Pitt centers have
played or are playing profes-
sional ball somewhere. Charles
Smith is the starting small for-

ward for the Knicks. Bobby
Martin is playing in the CBA and
is by far one of the most talent-
ed players in that league.
Darren Morningstar played and
started for the Dallas Mavericks
at the beginning of this season.

Current center Eric Mobley
will no doubt be drafted. That’s
a pretty good track record for a
coach who supposedly gets
nothing out of his
players.

Eric Mobley’s performance
Saturday at Fitzgerald was noth-
ing less than spectacular. He
torched Villanova for a career-
high 30 points and looked noth-
ing short of unstoppable in the
paint. Who’s the last big man to
put up a game like that at the
Field House? Does the name
Charles Smith ring a bell? No,
I’m not comparing Mobley to
Charles Smith. It’s just that
Mobley [showed everyone
Saturday that he has NBA
potential.

Brett
Fondrk

let’s slide on over to the NBA
for a minute. Is their a center in
the league better than David
Robinson right now? I

In the past few games, he has
averaged over 31 points and
nine rebounds a game, a near
double—double.

He had an NBA—high 50 last
night. Let’s look at the other
contenders for best center.

Hakeem Olajuwon?

Pittsburgh

Probably the second best but

not as quick or athletic as The
Admiral.

Patrick Ewing? Too slow.
Shaq? No jumper, no way.
The Spurs look like rocket sci-

entists for waiting on Robinson
to fulfill his naval commitment.
San Antonio is in first place and

they contend for the NBA
title.

finally righted their wrong and
got rid of their mistake, more
commonly known as Marty
McSorely.

McSorely and fellow defense-

man Jim Paek were traded away
to the Los Angeles Kings for ex-

Penguin center Shawn
McEachern and forward
Thomas Sandstrom. It is a great
trade, and not just for

Pittsburgh. Los Angeles needed
a physical defenseman, the
Pens needed some added scor-
ing punch with Lemieux and his
back being day—to—day.

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, Febﬂ 23, 1994

and at Pitt

Another trade rumor that
floated around had Ken
Wregget and Rick Tocchet
going to Detroit for Chris
Osgood and Paul Coffey. It
won’t happen.

To part with Wregget would
be even more foolish than the
preseason McSorely deal.

The Pens have fallen to third
place behind Boston and
Montreal, and that's been even
with Lemieux. It’s nothing to
worry about. It is better to have
Pittsburgh in third with Lemieux
than in first without him. Just his
presence on the ice, if even for
a few minutes in the playoffs, is
enough to carry the team
through a tough series.

So the Pens haven’t looked so
good as of late. But think about
this, they have made another
key late—season deal. It just may
be enough to put them over the
hump.

Win
Continued from page 7

At Pitt, Braud’s desire to win
has driven him to be one of the
best divers in the conference.

His first year he placed in the
top eight on both the 1- and 3-
meter dives at the Eastern
Seaboard Tournament.

As a sophomore, he missed
making the NCAAS — one of his
goals — by 0.3 of a_point.

This year Braud injured his
hand and wrist by hitting the
water the wrong way, but not
even an injury could hold back
his desire to win.

His first meet back, he fin-
ished second in the 3—meter,
and now he is “diving better
than I ever had.”

But sometimes when Braud is
not diving like he should, his
competitiveness gets the best of

him.

“It’s like a vicious cycle,” he
said. “When I’m on, I can’t miss.
But when I start missing, I get
upset. The drive is still there but
it goes into negative energy -
sometimes it’s bad.

“I want to win at everything I
do.”

And school is no exception.
Braud has been on the Dean’s
List every semester since sopho-
more year and boasts a 3.35
QPA.

“It’s the same winning edge in
school that I have in the pool,”
he added. ,

Braud has a dual major in the-
ater arts and communication.
After he graduates he plans to
take a year off and then go to
graduate school.

But donﬁt expect to see Braud

starring with Sharon Stone in
the near future.

“I don’t consider myself as
Laurence Olivier,” Braud said.

“I’m not sure what I want to
do. I’m exploring a couple of
avenues right now.”

One of those avenues is pur-
suing diving after college.

“It’s definitely a big possibili-
ty,” he said. “I still have that
fire.”

That ﬁre is the key ingredient
to Braud’s and the men’s swim-
ming and diving team success.
And although his team’s success
usually plays second fiddle to
basketball and football, it
doesn’t bother him.

“I’m not an athlete who needs
my picture plastered all over,”
he said.

“I just want to win.”

lead had dissipated to nothing.
Boston College fought back,
mostly on big baskets by inside
man Bill Curley and outside
gunner Huckaby.

“We really struggled for 40
minutes — we struggled offen-
sively and had trouble defend-
ing them at times, but our kids
willed themselves back into it,”
O’Brien said.

“It’s a tremendous win for the
reason that our kids really don’t
want to lose.”

But while the Eagles struggled
to get the win, the Panthers
fought down to their own ﬁnal
scenario.

The broken-wristed Sotiris
Aggelou dropped in an off-bal-
anced three—pointer to tie the
game after point guard Jerry
McCullough slashed for a basket
to cut the lead to two. With a
tied game, the Panthers attempt-
ed an inbounds pass that would
have given Mobley a chance to
put in a win, but instead of
shooting he tried a tip—pass to
Chris Gant, who was open
under the basket. The pass was
tipped out of bounds off of Pitt,
and Abrams followed with his
game-winning shot.

“[The play] was designed for
Eric to get the ball — it would
have been nice if he would
have caught that ball,” Evans
said. “Sotiris made the big shot,
but we have got to getother
people to hit it.”

“You couldn’t ask for a better
script,” Mobley said.

“It was perfect and I didn’t
execute. The play was designed
for me to be open, which I was
after Jerry set the pick. I defi-
nitely should have shot the ball
-— if I would have shot and
made it the clock would have
run out, if I would have missed
the clock would have run
out.

“I didn’t execute the last four
minutes.”

The Panthers were led in their
comeback from a seven—point,
first-half deficit by Antigua, who
hit ﬁve-of—six three-pointers and
finished with 19 points.

“Orlando hit some big threes.
He got the confidence on his
own,” Evans said.

“I’ve been struggling lately
and Sunday me and Sotiris shot
some threes,” Antigua said. “I
wanted to have confidence and
my shot.” *

Pitt Notes: The Panthers shot
45.6 percent in the game, but 55
percent in second half  Pitt
nailed eight—of-17 threes  BC
had one player with a double-

double — Curley, who pulled in-

12 boards to go with his 23
points. The Panthers had two —
Mobley (20 points, 13
rebounds) and McCullough (13
points, 10 assists)  Pitt out-
rebounded BC 40-34  Gant
was only two of six from the
floor, and finished with four
points and four rebounds 
The Panthers next play UConn,
the Big East's top team. They
are led by All-America candi-
date Donyell Marshall and super
rookie guard Doron Sheffer.
Donny Marshall and Kevin Ollie
help balance out the Top Ten
Huskies.
