CMU sophomore Ravish Momin dances to Rusted Root at last night's Syria Mosque street fair.

Mosque festival brings hope

‘  Gregory Flail ’ ’

. $‘ta_ﬁ“Writer

With the partially demolished facade of the
Syria Mosque as a backdrop, local performers
Rusted Root drummed yesterday’s Save The
Mosque celebration to a start.

The street fair signaled the beginning of a new
preservationist movement in Pittsburgh and drew

hundreds of concerned citizens to a blocked-off

section of Bigelow Boulevard.. , ~

City Council members Jim Ferlo, Bernard
“Baldy” Regan and Dan "Cohen emphasized the
power of a politically conscious community and
urged the crowd to support the designation of
the mosque as an historical landmark at today's
City Council meeting.

“We’ve got to ﬁght back,” Regan said. “We
have _to have you people, down at council
tomorrow, and if you’ve got a set of coconuts,
you will be down there with us. We need you!”

Performers and speakers clambered on and off
a makeshift tractor-trailer stage decorated with

star-spangled red draperies and a billboardwhich
displayed the “Gallery of Shame,” people that
the Preservation Pittsburgh committee deemed
responsible for the defacement of the mosque.
Members of the gallery included Pitt President J.
Dennis O’Connor and Mayor Sophie Masloff.
Another billboard prophesied the destruction
of other prominent landmarks, including the
Cathedral of Learning. According to Marshall
Goodwin, who attempted to obstruct the initial
demolition, many local landmarks may suffer the
same fate as the mosque. ' .
“[Preservation Pittsburgh] is going to be a
strong advocacy group to protect Pittsburgh’s
historical buildings because right now there’s

not a solid group in the city to do that,” Goodwin.

said. “We have a Historical Review Commission,
but they’re not really an advocacy group. The
mosque is really a good example of the fact that
there’s no one out there to protect our culture

and our history." .

Fraternities organize
memorial for victims
of motorcycle crash

By Kathy Kmiecik
sum“ Wﬁter

Pitt students Nathaniel Savage
and Eric Ulmer. will be
remembered in a service at Heinz
Chapel tomorrow at 1:30.

Savage and Ulmer werekilled
in a motorcycle accident at the
corner of Forbes Avenue and
Beeler Street on August 26. _

The service was organized by
Dave Cavenaugh and Sam
Johnson, members of Savage’s
fraternity, Phi Gamma Delta. The
service will be conducted by
Father Brian Summers.

The University of Pittsburgh's
Men’s Glee Club will perform at
the service. Speakers include Dr.
William Harmon, Vice President
of Student Affairs, Cavenaugh and
Phi Kappa Theta brother Brian

Lipinski.

Lipinski, a member of Ulmer’s
fraternity, was chosen along with
Cavenaugh to represent their
fraternities to speak in memory
of Ulmer and Savage.

Although both Cavenaugh and
Johnson are members of Savage’s
fraternity, they stressed that the
service is a joint effort involving
each of the fraternities and is
meant to honor both students.

They have met several times -

with Summers during the past‘
week and have tried to organize
a service that everyone can
appreciate, according tojohnson.

“The service is for anyone who
wants to come. Everyone is
welcome,” he said.

“We ask their friends to join us
in remembering them,”
Cavenaugh said.

CLEAN urges local action

By Gary Knapick

For The Pitt News

Pitt sophomore Dean Focareta
initiated an aluminum-can
recycling program several years
ago at his Catholic high school.
As the president of the Concerned

Leaders for Environmental Action 1

Now, Focareta is now among the
students who worked with Alcoa

to bring an extensive recycling ’

program to the entire Pitt campus.
While such large-scale
operations are nothing new to
the organization, its members
prefer to think on a smaller scale.
“If you only worry about large
things and don’t do localthings,
you only end up depressed, and
you never get things done.
Practical, localized information is
very important,” Focareta said.

Several of the organizations

ideas for future activities are aimed
athelping students “reduce, reuse
and recycle.” After trying
unsuccessfully to convince several
local eateries to stop using

Styrofoam cups, CLEAN members A

are now developing a reusable
mug program. (aptly named Mug
Yourself). Students using mugs
engraved with the CLEAN logo
could receive a discount on drinks
at participating restaurants.

A planned Trade and Giveaway

‘ Club will offer an alternative to ,

throwing useful items away.
CLEAN members also hope to
expand the current recycling
program to include newsprint
and glass. -
Planting trees on campus, litter
pick—ups and other hands-on
activities are also in the works.
Since its establishmentin 1989,

Choice Dollars, ‘which offers an
alternative to the conventional university
meal plans, is expanding to Dornino’s
Pizza. Currently, students can use choice
dollars at the Schenley Cafe and Cathedral
of Learning at Roy Rogers.

Pitt student Matt Razvillas said he eats
most of his meals using the choice—dollars
plan.

“Local businesses would be crazy if they
didn’t want [to be included in choice
dollars]. I heard that Domino’s Pizza is
making a killing. I mean, Oakland is run
by kids, and everyone goes out to eat,”
Rasvillas said.

Janet Latvala, owner of the Craig Street
Dorr1ino’s, said they are not “making a
killing,” but the program “has helped

 

sales, [but] I wouldn’t say signiﬁcantly at
this point. I don’t think many students are
aware that they can use choice dollars
with us," Latvala said.

Students who order from Domino’s call
in their meal-plan number from the back
of their ID, and the amount of the sale is
billed to their choice—dollars account. The
delivery person brings a receipt to be
signed by the customer.

While some students are worried about
their numbers being used without their
knowledge, Latvala said that there have
been no problems so far. “The students
have been very cooperative. They have
not tried to be fraudulent in any way,”
Latvala said.

James Beaver, director of Pitt's Housing
and Food Service, said it is unlikely that
many off-campus businesses will use
choice dollars because it’s too expensive.

“It costsapproximately $4,700 per year
for a business to operate in the program.
This includes installation of the equipment
and operation costs. Then the university
also wants a percentage of the profits, so
it can go back to the students in the form

- of money for dorm improvements and so

on,” Beaver said.

He also said the university should not
help fund the ‘costs of expanding the
program to off—campus businesses. “When
there is a surplus of funding in our office,
it is supposed to go to the dorms.

“For a while the Student Government
Board was checking into the possibility of
helping to fund the cost, but then if that
happens, it will be with your student
activities fee, which I don’t_ think is fair,”
Beaver said.

He explained that the 19- or 14-meal
plan has to be mandatory for ﬁrst—year

- .~ I  —.:\

 

s University food service extends Choice Dollars to Dornino’s

students to keep prices down. He
explained that if meal plans weren’t
required, the prices would increase
dramatically in a very short period of time.

“We have to have a meal plan for. the
students. We don’t allow any heavy
cooking in the rooms, and we try and get
student input," he said.

Beaver said a branch of the Student
Government Board meets periodically with

members of the management to voice —

concerns and make changes in the food
service. '

Joe Bowman, a junior, said, “I hated the I

cafeteria food. I never ate it. I ate a lot of
cereal. If you are a freshman, [the meal
plan] is good. When I was [a first-year
student], I didn’t even know Schenley
Cafe was here.” -

(77719 is tbeﬁrst installment of a
bi-weekly column written by
Frank Carter, director of the
Student Health Service.)

 Health care is expensive. Today
over 12 percent of the U.S. gross
‘national income goes for health-
care services. This amount is
projected to grow to nearly 15
percent of the GNP by the year

. 2000.

J ' Most people protect

. , themselves from devastating
medical expenditures by carrying
some form of health insurance.

Unfortunately some 37 million

_ people in the United States have
‘  no health insurance.

Many college students are
atnong this group of uninsured
» people. Surveys by the Student
, Health Service consistently

3 . indicate that 10 to 11 percent of
7' - . the students at Pitt are not covered
’ , by an insurance plan.

Additionally, many students are

dropped from their parents’ plan
upon reaching the age of 19.

The University of Pittsburgh

 \ (through a private insurance

  

company) endorses a student
accident and sickness-insurance
program so that large, unexpected
medical expenses may not force
a student to withdraw from the
university and/or be unable to
continue studies following
recuperation from an injury or
illness. This program has been
developed over the years by the
Student Health ' Insurance
committee. 9 V
This committee is made up of
representatives from the Student
Health Service, Office of Student
‘Affairs, Office of International
Services and the Office of Risk
Management. The committee
receives input from students,
particularly the Student Health
Advisory Board, on matters

' affecting the program.

The committee ensures that the
program is available to all
registered students and that it
complies with the requirements
of federal and state laws such as
Title IX of the Education
Amendment of 1972, which
requires that maternity beneﬁts

 

_ CARTER

be provided on the same basis as
any other disability, and
Pennsylvania Law 233,’ on
substance abuse which mandates
treatment.

This program is designed to
complement the services offered
by the Student Health Service
and Counseling Center. The
committee continually evaluates

the program to make sure it is ,

meeting the needs of the insured
individuals and returns as. much
as possible of the premium in the
form of medical beneﬁts.

The committee works hard to
assure that a balance is established

between necessary coverage and
the ability of students to pay the
premium. The program is bid to
insurance carriers.

Itis desirable to establish long-
term arrangements with the
insurance carrier and that bids be
maintained for at least three years,
provided service .is satisfactory
and renewal premium rates are
reasonable and based on paid
claims. ‘

The program was open for bids
this school year. The successful
underwriteris the John_Hancock
Insurance Company of Boston,
Mass. The premium is $407 per
student from the time of
enrollment until Aug. 28, 1992.

The last date for enrollment for
the year is Sept. 30, 1991. There
will be another enrollment period
in January 1992.

Every registered student should

. have received a brochure with an

enrollment card through the mail.
Additional brochures are
available at the Student Health
Service, located at
Brackenridge Hall.

Workshop creates better Writers

By Laura Gallagher

Staﬁ’ Wﬁter

Pitt's Writing Workshop helps
ﬁnd solutions for those who
want to become better writers.

“Our job is not to help make
a speciﬁc student’s text better.
It’s to make the student a better
writer. Often students come in
with a text and say, ‘It’s due in
two hours. Fix it.’ Our purpose
is to help them, not the piece of
paper  I prefer to get students
at the earliest possible moment
because if they can think out
what they’re going to do, the
writing task becomes much
simpler,” said workshop
director William Smith.

When instructors refer
students to the Writing

Workshop, some students think '

of it as a punishment, said
workshop tutor Geeta Kothari.

“Students are [at Pitt] to learn,
and the Writing Workshop
wouldbe a part of that learning,”
Smith said.

“One advantage is you can
have a non-teacher talk to you
 like Bill Cosby telling you
something as [Cliff] Huxtable.
It’s really the same thing that
your parents tell you,” Smith
said. «
Pitt sophomore Brooke
Kitzmiller said the Writing
Workshop helped her get an A-
in her literature class.

“It really helped. They knew

' what they were talking about.

They read the papers and
pointed out inconsistencies,”
Kitzmiller said.
Jennifer Birr, a
sophomore, also

Pitt
spoke

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 4, 1991

positively of her experiences at
the Writing Workshop. “I went
there two or three times. You
went there, and you asked them
about a certain assignment 
They actually guide you through
the assignments. But if you
didn’t have anything written
down, they wouldn ’t write it for
you,” Birr said.

Serving “everybody in the
university,” according to Smith,

the workshop sees faculty, staff -

and students ———”from ﬁrst-year
to doctoral students.”

After a slow first week, service
at the workshop picks up to 95-
to 1 O0—percent capacity
throughout the.term, Smith said. '
“They don't have much time to
breathe in there.”

The workshop has 12 to 14
tutors made up of English faculty
members and graduate students,
providing one-on—one sessions
lasting up to an hour.

“In that hour we assess
students’ strengths and
weaknesses. in their writing,”
said tutor Sylvia Hall.

The methods for diagnosing
writing problems vary from tutor
to tutor, Smith said. “Some look
at what the student has written.
Some never look at what the
student has ‘written. Some do it
by interviewing.”

Tutors usually do not have to
read an entire paper to diagnose
a writing problem, Kothari said.

After diagnosis, the tutor ﬁnds

a way for the student to see and-

solve the‘ problem. “Because
we will usually see the student
only once, we have to ﬁx the
problem in one hour,” Smith
said.

I . I l r « ¢ r 4 «

Tutors do not evaluate
students in any way and do not
proofread students’ papers; “We
get a lot of foreign students
coming in, wanting us to
proofread," Kothari said.

Tutors at the workshop often .

encounter “writing anxiety.”
“We generally talk with [these
students] and encourage them,”
Hall said.
“We generally see results,”
Kothari said. “There are some
students where nothing

, changes. But 4a lot of times, a

light bulb goes off, and they
stop coming.”

The workshop is not only for
writing classes but for resumes
and job applications as well.

“The Writing Workshop is
more at Pitt than a tutoring
service. It’s also a center for
research  It is an attempt to
service students but also to build
for the future,” Smith said.

The workshop currently has
a computer tutorial to help
students understand one of the
readings in the General Writing
text, Ways of Reading, Kothari
said.

“I’m currently working with
the Air Force on artiﬁcial tutors.
The computer» knows the
answers to your questions,”
Smith said.

The workshop also has a
program to. teach education
students _how to tutor. “It’s _a
mentor program,” Kothari said.

Interested students, faculty or
staff can call _the Writing
Workshop in advance to make
an appointment to see a tutor.
Students without appointments
are also accepted.

whether the remainder of the

According to Goodwin, pipes
have been moved, and some
partition walls have been torn

Others maintained a more
pessimistic view. John Murdoch,
who was arrested along with

Students hope O’Connor will Work on finances, minority concerns

By Catherine Goldstein
Staﬂ“ Writer

Since President J. Dennis
O’Connor began his reign on
Aug. 1, he has been quite visible,
from attending the president’s
picnic to redecorating his office.
Several students expressed their
concerns and opinions about
O’Connor, hoping he will be

CLEAN

Continued from page 1
CLEAN has provided students
with environmental information
through several workshops.
Featured at past gatherings were

speakers from groups including ’

the Group for Recycling in
Pennsylvania, the World

Federalists (a Pittsburgh—based '

enviro-political group) and the
Pitt faculty. Seminars typically
included a group discussion
period and a Greenpeace video.

CLEAN members have also
contributed their time and effort
to a variety of larger
environmental groups. Last year
the National Resource Defense
Council was the beneficiary of a
fund-raising concert featuring

I Rusted Root and Tiny Little Help.

The organization also collected
signatures for a Greenpeace-
sponsored petition calling for an

end to the practice of sending.

garbage to Third World nations.

More than anything else, CLEAN
members would like to see
students cooperate with existing
recycling programs.

CLEAN Vice President Holly
Hovis said, “My biggest pet peeve
is when I see that trash cans are
still full of [recyclable] cans.”

Things could be worse, as
treasurer Sarah MacMillan knows
well.

‘ As a transfer student from
Duquesne University, she
described the reaction to the
student environmental group she
started there as “a big joke.
Everyone made fun of it.”

At Pitt, students seemed much
more receptive to such a, group.
“They were really into it,” she
explained.

CLEAN President Focareta said
he addresses environmentalism
on a grass—roots, humanitarian
level and prefers low—profile
action as opposed to hype.

“I’d rather see people sort their
garbage than attend a rally,” he
said. -

A ‘few CLEAN members are A
selected annually to represent

their organization at the annual
convention of the Student
Environmental Action Coalition,
held in Colorado.

MacMillan said, “People are
always asking me, ‘What are you
guys doing about this?’ or, ‘What
are you guysidoing about that?’ I
can’t help thinking, ‘What are
you doing about it?”’~

relate well to students. He knows
what’s going on, on campus, and
I think he’ll keep an open policy.
He’s also very down to earth and
accessible. The several times I've
spoken with him, he has said
exactly what’s on his mind, and if
he can do something, he says he
can do it. If he can’t, he says it. I
think he’ll be a good president
and an asset to the school. What
we have to do is wait and see if
he can raise money. We know he
can spend it, but can he raise it?

so much on sports. The
scholarship money should be

focus on is emphasizing equality

black faculty and administration.
Mike Naylor
Senior

Speaking as a black student, I
feel that everyone had the chance
to come and visit the school, and
they decided to enroll here, and
personally I like it the way it is.
Although other black students
have valid points, there are more
important issues to be dealt with.
For example, the new president

When Eve McPartland began
working at Magee Women’s
Hospital a few years ago, one of
her main concerns was ﬁnding

In April 1988 when Eve
became pregnant, she and her
husband, Timothy, a research
lab technician at Pitt, had their
names added to the waiting list
for the University Child

Although that pregnancy
resulted in a miscarriage, the
couple remained on the list, and —
when their daughter, Carly, was
born more than a year later, they '
had just received word that a

the service — deﬁnitely get

Long Wait drawback of Pitt day care

Pitt students claims that the
center gives priority to
employees over students who
are waiting for openings, and
that the service is too expensive
for student parents to afford.

The Coalition for Child Care at
Pitt is currently lobbying the
administration for increased
availability of part-time care and
more affordable rates.

In spite of her wait, McPartland
now has both Carly, two years
and three months old, and her
second daughter, Sarah, nine
months old, enrolled in the
center and said she has never
had any problems.

“The staff is really supportive
— almost like a second family.

They know almost as much,

about the children as you do, “
McPartland said.’
_ With their first child,
McPartland said she and her
husband had a lot of questions.
“Being new parents, the ﬁrst
time they provided so much
information and help,” she said.

 

“At first it was hard, but now it’s
our lives, and they’re a big part
of it.”

‘ “It was much easier when we
had our second daughter —
having the same caregiver,” she
said. , .

McPartland, in-vitro
fertilization lab supervisor’ at
Magee, also likes the fact that
she can stop in and see her
daughters any time.

“They work with any
schedule,” she said, adding that
this is a plus for women who are
nursing.

McPartland said Carly is
benefitting socially from the
interaction with the other
children. ,

“There are not a lot of children
around our house, so for my
older daughter, it’s wonderful,”
she said.

The McPartlands live in
Brentwood in the South Hills.

Children at the center have a
daily schedule divided into free

I would like him to re—evaluate
how people spend money at Pitt.
For example, he can have $82,000.

to redecorate his office, but there’s »

no chalk in the classrooms. Maybe
there should be some kind of
board of teachers and students to
monitor the spending, because it
seems to be rather haphazard. I
would also like to see him do
more with recycling programs
and be more vocal about
environmental issues. There
should also be a community
project to clean up around school
and the Oakland area.

Amerzcan superiority

While the people of the Soviet Union, after decades of
repression, are experiencing their newfound freedoms
with an explosion of diverse opinion, Americans are
showing alarming intolerance toward dissent.

Since the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s, people have
begun using the phrase “un-American” to describe
everyone from critics of the government to critics of war.

Americans seem to want to forget that the First
Amendment not only guarantees free speech but also
encourages citizens to use this right to “petition the
government for a redress of grievances.”

When the framers of this country’s Constitution wrote
the laws by which Americans were to be governed, they
included many freedoms. Implied along with these
freedoms was a responsibility: the duty of each citizen to
hold the government accountable for its actions.

The First Amendment was not created to be an idealistic
right for which Americans should be honor\ed to fight.
Many people’s opinions of protesters seem to be, “I can’t
believe that you are complaining when our troops are
fighting.for your right to complain.” During Desert Storm

this was never more apparent, as opposition to Bush’s war

in the Gulf resulted in cries of “cowards,” “hippies” and
a variety of more explicit and angry epithets for Americans
who saw the war as unjustified.
The mistreatment of the troops during the Vietnam
conflict played a role in people’s attitudes during this war.
But the lesson of Vietnam we chose to ignore was the
government’s incompetence that bungled so many aspects

of thatwar and caused so many deaths.

-With communism crumbling in the Soviet Union, many
Americans have also displayed their intolerance towards
a different system - of government by criticizing the
theoretical basis of communism and blindly extolling the

«'57 virtues of American democracy.

As the USSR continues to become more diversified each
day and profound changes which are altering communism
irreparably occur every other hour, Americans fight for
what they believe in. “The Right to Burn” is included here.

Those who don’t agree with American policies feel that
the most symbolic way to express their discontent is to
burn the ﬂag of which we are supposed to be so proud.
The ﬂag which represents freedom at its finest — the
United States of America.

Whereas American pride was disintegrating a few years '

Qago, it has recently made a rapid recovery. We still believe

 up

 

that we are superior to any other country and that our
form of government is more powerful than any other.

This “blind patriotism” is hindering the judgment of the
nation as a whole. If Americans continue to believe that
they are ‘better than anyone else, we will self-destruct and
become as weak as the Germans were when Hitler came
into power.

Trying to improve your country is the best way to show
your love for it. ' .

Now that" school has started, it’s time to thinkof
the perfect vacation spot to spend Winter’ Break.
I’m sure that most people would opt for some place
like Florida or the Bahamas, but those people
would miss out on the hottest tourist trap of them
all. After all, there’s nowhere better to celebrate the

coldest season of the year than the place that’s’

famous for it: the Soviet Union.

These days, there’s more to do in the Soviet Union
than just visit the toppled statues of former leaders..

try to speak to the natives in their own language?

It’s a wonder Intourist, the ofﬁcial Soviet travel
agency, can stay in business. So I thought I’d help
them out with my own little “Post-Cold War Tour”
of the Soviet Union. ~

Skeptics will ask: What could possibly interest a
’90s tourist in these hip, post-glasnosttimes? It’s true
that the Evil Empire was much more fun to visit
when it wasn't so easy to get in. These days, I think
it takes more ' paperwork to get a Pennsylvania
driver’s license than it does to get a visa to visit the
Soviet /Union.Of course, that’s because over there

, no one can afford a car, so there’s no need for a

driver’s license. ,
Nevertheless, it’s very important to see the Smdiet
"Union now for the simple reason that come next
spring, the name will probably have changed to
“Soviet Confederationof .a Bunch of Little Tiny
Countries That Are Going To Be Really Sorry They
Ever Left.” 4 T ' -
The Soviet Union is changing so fast that the
poor people at Rand—McNal1y can’t even keep up
with it all. According to one friend of mine, even
the Moscow McDonald’s‘ is on the verge of forming
its own country. '
I think it would be nice to see the ex-Evil Empire
before Boris Yeltsin tries to get Major League

Hostage Resort on the Black Sea. Interested tourists
will also be able to tour the site of Gorbachev’s

, three-day captivity free of worry. (Security at the
resort has been considerably upgraded since the
coup.) The only, hitch is that you have to supply.

your own tape.

If you're going to visit the Soviet Union, though, , T
‘ you have to make a stop at the Baltic States. Now A

that Lithuania and Latvia have started granting visas
to Americans, travel there is now considerably
easier than it was a year ago. Of course the fact that
the Soviet soldiers are less trigger—happy helps, too.

The best place to visit in the whole country is the

Berlin Wall Memorial, a 1:1 scale model of that.

former barricade that protected East Berlin from the
West and vice versa. Located around the home of
Mikhail Gorbachev, the Wall contains a new piece
of graffiti that can only be seen by the trained eye.

It _ reads: “Dear Mikey — April Fools! —— from
Boris.T’ I wonder why everyone thinks the Russians
are so serious. ’ .

There you have it —.the best possible tour of the
Soviet Union anyone could come up with. There's
just one other small detail, though:

Don't tell Intourist that I sent you.

Sta_[)" Writer

With less than three days to go before
their season begins-, the Pitt soccer team
appears poised to pounce on their Big East
rivals. This year’s Panther squad is packed
with a strong core of returning starters,
along witl1 a good mixture of promising
rookies.

Leading the assault for Pitt is senior
midﬁelder and co-captain Nick Liberati.
Panther Coach Joe Luxbacher feels
conﬁdent that Liberati will supply both

_leadership and skill to help the team

‘throughout the course of the season.

Another returning starter who will be
integral to the Panther squad this year is
senior Mike Watson. Although Watson
will surely be a starter, it is not quite clear
whether he will be at defense or atsweeper.
‘ At the goaltender position this year will
be returning senior Tim Sobelman. After
sharing the goalkeeper duties last year

—with Jay Kapusta, Sobelman has earned
the starting position in the eyes of his
coach. ‘

“Tim is definitely the incumbent,” noted
Luxbacher. “However we do have some
strong, young goalkeepers who are very
competitive.”

Last year Sobelman lead the Big East in
goals against average, a statistic designed
to measure a goalkeeper’s ability to prevent
goals. ’

_. Some other players that Luxbacher.

pointed out are junior ].R. Perdue, senior

Ivanif  and"first—yeaIf.’_player -Erik 

Prex. Of Perdue, Luxbacher said. “His best
play is yet to come.”

He added that Amayo “is a very smooth,
experienced player who can score and
play well off the ball, opening up the ﬁeld
for other players."

  VC/oodson gives Steelers

 

One group of players that Luxbacher
seemed particularlypleased with are the
newcomers.

Prex, who led the WPIAL in scoring this
year, appears to have left a strong
impression during the preseason.

“Erik has good speed and he works
hard,-” Luxbacher said. Two other
noteworthy first-year players are Charlie
Wasson and Bobby Dyer. Luxbacher said
they “are both going to be strong players.”

‘ One major difference for the Pitt team
this -year is the change made“ to their
schedule. The Panthers have dropped a
few of the teams that they had consistently
beaten and added some more high-
powered teams. Two Division I_-A teams
that have been added are ‘Marshall
University and Canisus College. '

Besides the additions to their schedule,
the Panthers will again be tested by
members of their own conference. Among
the teams expected to be extremly
competitive are powerhouses Seton Hall,
Syracuse and Boston College.

As for team goals this season, Luxbacher
hopes his squad can play, “as well as we
can and to combine all of the individual
talents into a strong winning effort because
that’s what wins games.”

A major difference that Luxbacher sees
between this year’s sqad and last year’s is
that the present team ﬁnished strongly at
the end of their last season, and that
they’ve_ had a good chance to work
together. Other differences are that this
year’s team worked extremely hard over

" the summer and the -addition of a strong

first—year class. ‘

Aside from their coach’s positive attitude,
the players seem excited about the opening
game, and the team’s general outlook
appears positive. ,,

There were no Elvis sightings
reported at Three Rivers Stadiuréf
on Sunday. However Superman
made an appearance —- in the
form of Rod Woodson.

Woodson, an All-Pro performer
who held out for virtually the
entire preseason, performed as
though he had been in training
ca mp from day one. On defense,
he was absolutely outstanding in
pass coverage. He returned punts
(four to be exact) and one kickoff
for a combined total of 78 yards.
Not bad. Especially for somed/fé
playing in his first game in eight
months. _

But we're not just talking about
anyone here. We're talking about
Rod (Superman) Woodson.. The
same Rod Woodson who last
year led the Steeler secondary
with ﬁve interceptions. The same
Rod Woodson who a year ago
led the Steelers in both kickoff-
and punt-return yardage.

Said free safety Thomas Everett:
“[Woodsonl had a great game

no training camp at all  fresh-.,.

Woodsonis a world-class athlete

Redskins poised to make run at

By Michael Milliron
Staff Writer

Head coach Joe Gibbs makes
the talented Washington
Redskins that much better. He is
the best “x” and “o” man in the
game, a fact Buddy Ryan would
reluctantly attest to. Gibbs will try
to get more consistent play out of
quarterback Mark Rypien. If
Rypien gains consistency, he has
the supporting cast to take the
‘Skins to the Super Bowl.

Center Jeff Bostic is a “Hog”
holdover on an effective offensive
line that features All-Pro tackle
Jim Lachey. Washington will run
the counter trey with running
back Earnest Byner to death, until
a defense finally gets‘ tired and
gives up a big play in the fourth
quarter.

The “Posse” is still one of the
elite receiving corps in the
National Football ‘League. Gary
Clark is as a consistent a big play

V receiver as they come. Art Monk

is open more than 7—Eleven. Ricky

R‘ Sanders needs to bounce back

from an off year in ’90.
Defensive coordi-nator Richie
Petitbon does a masterful job of
managing his personnel.
Cornerback Darrell Green does

. an excellent job of containing the

$
it

most dangerous receivers.
Linebacker Andre Collins was a
real find in last year’s draft and
fits beautifully in the Redskins 4-

’49ers via Plan B to play middle

. linebacker. A big year from

defensive end Charles Mann
would be a plus. (11—5. The
Redskins are ‘due for another
Super Bowl appearance.)

The New York Giants will
have the stigma of trying to repeat
in 1991. This team has
uncharacteristically made a lot of
changes for a Super Bowl
Champion. Bill Parcells joins Bill
Walsh at NBC. Bill Belichick,
who probably would be the
Giants’ head coach had Parcells
made a decision sooner, has taken

 his defensive wares to coach the

Cleveland Browns. New Coach
Ray Handley has made a
controversial quarterback change,
going with Super Bowl winner
"Jeff Hostetler over Phil Simms.
Offensively the Giants will

“We have a lot of good, young
guys who will make us better this

€'!!‘,Iear," said Watson. “We are solid

at every position and I think we
can play with anyone.”

Sobelman echoed Watson's
bright appraisal of the team's
future by saying “we probably
have 15 guys who can start; we're
a very deep team."

Aside from Liberati, Luxbacher
plans on naming two additional
captains before the start of the
season.

The Panthers’ first regular-
season game will be Saturday,
September 7 at Geneva. The
Panthers’ first home game will be
Sunday, September 15 against
Big East rival St. John's, which
will also serve as the Panthers’
first Big East game of the season.

continue to emphasize ball control
and power football. That means
running backs Ottis Anderson and
Rodney Hampton going straight
ahead behind a giant offensive
line anchored by “Jumbo” Elliott.

, A weakness could exist at wide

receiver, where the Giants do not
have a “go to” guy. Tight end
Mark Bavaro is gone. Help may
be on the way in the form of
third—round receiver Ed
McCaffrey, who Bill Walsh
predicts will be in the Pro Bowl
soon.

New York will continue to win
because of their defense. Handley
is not replacing Lawrence Taylor
at linebacker. L.T. is no longer
the most dominant defender in
football, but it is unwise to incite
his wrath. The tradition of strong
Giant linebacking units continues
with'Car1 Banks, PepperJohnson
and Gary Reasons joining Taylor.
Defensive ends Leonard Marshall
and Eric Dorsey and nose tackle
Erik Howard form a very solid
front three. Mark Collins may be
the most underrated corner in the
league. Myron Guyton will head
hunt from his free safety spot.
(10-6, with another playoff
appearance.)

With QB Randall Cunningham
suffering torn knee ligaments in
the season opener, the
Philadelphia Eagles will face an
uphill battle to make the playoffs.
Things will still be interesting,
however, as the controversial
Jimmy Mac (Jim McMahon) will
be taking the helm of the Eagle
0. McMahon can still play, but
can a shoddy offensive line that
failed to protect the super—mobile

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, September 4, 1991

Vikings, Bears to face-off in NFC Central showdown

By Michael Milliron
Sta_ﬂ' Writer

It appears as though the
Minnesota Vikings will finally
employ an offense that will best
suit running ‘back. Herschel
Walker after mortgaging the
present and future for him. They
will feature a lot of one-back sets
with pitch-outs and off-tackle
plays. Walker still has a great
burst, is fast and is one gigantic
 well, you know. Plus he can
catch the football.

This new offense also means
that Viking receivers Anthony
Carter, a jackrabbit in the open
ﬁeld, HassanJones and Cris Carter
will be on the field at the same

: time. These guys rival the

Redskins’ “Posse.” Quarterback
Wade Wilson will be operating
behind an offensive line that can

both run and pass-block. Guard

Randall McDaniel and tackle Gary
Zimmerman are Pro- Bowlers.
T ight" end Steve Jordan is a
versatile player.

Due to Ronnie Lott’s age,
Minnesota strong safety Joey
Browner is the most dominating
safety in the NFL. He brings down
running backs with one hand.
This group hopes that defensive
tackle Keith Millard comes back
after week four and dominates
the interior of the line as he did
before his injury. The Vikes
possess numerous impact
defenders in end Chris Doleman,
outside linebacker Mike
Merriweather and safety Felix
Wright. Carl Lee has lost a step on
the left corner. (10—6, as the
Vikes love’ their last place
schedule and no pressure to win.)

Mike Ditkas’s Monsters of the
Midway are always masterfully
retooled by Chicago Bears’ Vice

President Bill Tobin, who has
never had a bust no. 1 pick. Last
year’s no. 1 selection of safety
Mark Carrier was widely criticized
until he led the NFL in
interceptions and brought
uncommon rookie leadership to
the secondary. This year’s rookie
crop has a few hidden gems in
defensive tackle Chris " Zorich,
receiver Anthony Morgan and
running back Darren_Lewis. Look
out for rookie free-agent
defensive end James Williams

(six-foot, seven-inches and 505

pounds) as an impact situational
pass rusher. .

The defensive line is losing
defensive tackle Dan Hampton
but is still ably manned by DTs
William Perry and Steve‘
McMichael and DEs Richard Dent
and Trace Armstrong. Middle
linebacker Mike Singletary
remains to lead the defensive

unit. Outside linebackers Ron
Rivera and Jim Morrissey could
lose playing time to John Roper
and Ron Cox, who possess more
big—play ability. Donnel Woolford
is a solid cornerback, and the
Bears hope Shaun Gayle can come
back from injury.

Running back Neal Anderson is
the Chicago Bears’ offense, as
attempts to improve the passing
game looked fruitless in the
preseason. Anderson is fast, has
great vision, is elusive,and runs
even faster with people chasing
him. Fullback Brad Muster
complements Anderson nicely.
There is concern over tacklejimbo
Covert’s season-ending injury.
Quarterback Jim Harbaugh will
look to have a couple of big plays
a game. The Bear receiving corps
probably could not be found with
a “Posse,” let alone play like the
“Posse.” (10-6 and the playoffs, as

Hey, what do you know? The
Tampa Bay Buccaneers have a
new head coach. Richard
Williamson replaces Ray
“Perplexed” Perkins. QB Vinny
Testaverde should benefit as
Williamson will open up the
offense. Testaverde has all the
physical tools to be a gamer.

Gary Anderson will be featured
as a rusher and receiver. Look for
a leaping Anderson to be landing
in the end zone with some
frequency this season. Reggie
Cobb will relieve Anderson some,
so that Anderson does not take
too great a pounding. Wide
receiver Mark Carrier will try to
revert to his ’89 Pro—Bowl form.

Floyd Peters has come from
Minnesota to coordinate the
defense. His first task will be to
convert Keith McCants to Keith
McCansas a DE in his 4-3 scheme.
McCants could be another
Doleman. LB Broderick Thomas
will try to realize his potential

McCants. The Bucs would like to
increase their speed at safety.
Wayne Haddix is a Pro—Bowl
corner, and Ricky Reynolds is
competent on the other side. (6-
10, as the Bucs suffer defensive
growing pains.)

Barry Sanders will keep the
Detroit Lions out of the cellar.
He is the biggest game-breaker in
football today. No one scares a
defense like Sanders.

The quarterback situation is
bleak. Starter Rodney Peete is
injury-prone. Promising Andre
Ware has been demoted to third
string. due to inept play in the
preseason. Second-stringer Erik
Kramer should not even be
wearing an NFL uniform.

The offensive line is adequate;
however they must adjust their
blocking to new schemes and
sets since

cornerback situation kills this team
and safety Bennie Blades can hit,
but has not been the center fielder
the Lions had hoped_for. (S-1 1, as
Fontes has unhappy holidays.)
The Green Bay Packers are

THE  NEWS, Wednesday, September 4, 1991

By Brian Berger
Showcase Editor

The Soviet Union is in trouble.
Not in the political reforms that
are sweeping that country, but
on the ice, where the once-
dominant Reds are in serious
jeopardy of being ousted from
the Canada Cup before the medal
round.

Ah, the joy of hockey in late
summer. And while the ice is
slick in some rinks across North
America, the play of the Soviets
has been anything but. On
Saturday, the USSR was stunned
by Czechoslovakia 5-2. Then on
Monday Team Sweden. got a late
goal from Tomas Sandstrom (of
the Los Angeles Kings) to deﬂate
a Russian third—period uprising
and lift the Swedes to a 3~2
victory. The loss puts the Soviets

at 0-2, in last place in the
standings and in a must-win
situation if they have any hope
of advancing to the medal round.
(Only the top four point-getters
qualify.) The Soviets have yet to
score a goal in each of the first
two periods of both of their
games and are 0-10 on the power
play thus far. V

While the Soviets struggle,
Team Finland surprises. The
Finns shocked Canada on
Saturday by dueling to a two-all
draw. Then on Monday, Christian
Ruutu (of the Buffalo Sabres)
scored a ﬂuke goal off the stick
of a Czechoslovakian
defenseman with 17 seconds
remaining to break a scoreless
draw and keep Finland unbeaten
and shockingly in a tie with the
Canadians for first place overall
with three points. Goaltender

Markus Ketterer has led the
Finnish charge by turning away
78 of 80 shots in two games and
recording the tournament's only
shutout (vs. Czechoslovakia).
Finland was projected to ﬁnish
last in the tournament but has
been led by Ketterer and a speedy
defensive team that has played
excellent positional hockey. The
quick Finns have beneﬁted from
the style of play of the tournament,
which has been a more European
and wide open style than the
more physical style played in
North America. Two former
teammates and Stanley Cup
ringwearers, Essa T ikkanen and
Jan Kurri, are the Finnish captains.

Team Canada remains the
squad to beat, though. The

defending Cup holders are led by .

Lord Gretzky and a host of NHL
stars.

The line of Gretzky, Eric Iindros
(who has looked very impressive)
and Luc Robitaille is frightening
and coupled with a line of late-
entry Mark Messier, Steve Larmer
and Theo Fluery gives the Habs
some incredible scoring punch.

Canada came out sloppy
against a .pesky Finnish team
before turning loose on Team
USA on Monday, thwarting their
neighbors 6-3.

As for the Americans, their
problem seems to stem from the
old Penguin problem: They can
score, but they just can’t stop
you. They've scored and given

up a tournament-high nine goals. -

Things will have to improve
defensively for Coach Terry
Taylor’s boys if the Americans
hope to advance.

Craig Janney leads all’ scorers
in Cup action with three goals

and two assists.
Sweden is an enigmatic team.

The defending World Cup, .
Champions return 11 players from  I

that squad as well as a host/of
NHL stars (Tomas Steen, Kjell
and Ulfsamuelsson, Ex-Canadien
Mats Naslund). But looked awful
defensively against 'the
Americans.

They dominated the Russians
only to give up the lead and then
win on a late goal. There is too
much talent on this roster for
Sweden not to have an impact.

The Czechoslovakians beat the

USSR then struggled against‘

Finland as they were blanked 1-
0. Not much is expected of this
team, which along with Finland
was left off the pre—tournament
medal—round predictions.

CB RobertMassey from the Saints.

DL Eric Swann was the big
gamble of the draft, and the Cards
took it. He may eventually be an
unblockable behemoth. DL Mike
Jones and CBS Aeneas Williams
and Dexter Davis were solid picks.

Woodson

Continued from page 10

two-time Indiana state champion
in the low and high hurdles. He
was also an all-conference
basketball player. Three years
ago he placed ‘second to

Washington’s Darrell Green ir2,,,,4

the NFL Fastest Man competition.
Last year he placed third.

Woodson is a player the Steelers
can ill afford to lose.

“Outstanding,” said Chuck Noll
about Woodson’s performance.
“He did a great job  returning,
playing, everything. I thought he
did a great job.”

When Woodson signed with
the Steelers less than two weeks
ago, he became the highest-paid
player in the club’s history,
surpassing quarterback Bubby

Brister’s annual $916,667 salary,”

Woodson’s new contract will
reportedly pay him an average of
$1.45 million a year for the next
three years.

Is he worth it?

The obvious answer is a big, fat
YES. _In fact, the Steelers may be
getting a bargain.

Woodson is only the second-
highest-paid defensive back in
the league.

After Sunday's performance he
deserves to be paid whatever he

wants because he is, simply put, I
, one of the best at what he does.

And that is play football.

With the possible exception of
Atlanta’s “Neon” Deion Sanders,
no other kickoff or punt
returnman generates the
excitement that Woodson does.
On defense he sticks to his man
like glue, rarely blowing a

‘ coverage assignment.

One can only imagine how

‘Woodson might have performeﬁtog.

had he been in training camp.

“I just went out there, and I
played basically well,” Woodson
said after Sunday’s 26-20 victory.
“I played well for the first game;
I have a lot of room for
improvement, but so does our
whole defense  we’re gonna try
to improve every game and every
day."

Woodson is the calm, collected
leader of a Steeler defense that
last year finished not only as the
NFL’stop pass defense but also
the league’s top overall defense.

Can we expect to see the
defense play as well this year as
they did last season?

“We have a long way to go to
get back [to] where we were last
year,” said Everett. “[But] we’re

- capable of getting back to where
