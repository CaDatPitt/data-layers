WASHINGTON, D.C.—The

Capitol steps‘ were the scene on‘

Saturday for_ the largest anti-draft
rally-since the late sixties, with a
crowd police estimated to number
over_30,000. . '
The "protest centered on three
demands: no registration, no draft
and no war, with the hope that
Congress might take the protesters’
demands seriously—en_ough not to
pass the supplemental appropria-
tions necessary for the Selective Ser-

vice System to be implemented, as -
proposed by -President Carter.
The rally was organized by the“-

National Mobilization Against the
Draft, ,a broad-based coalition of
religious, socialist, and black
groups, who had all furnished
speakers for the rally.

One of the speakers, Stokely Car-‘ 0’ 1 I 

michael of the All-African People’s

" Revolutionary Party, spoke excited-

ly of the need for organization of
the demonstrations against the
draft, praising Saturday’s rally. -

Organization was anything but. '
absent on Saturday,'with five weeks"

of planning going into the rally ac-.
cording to Patrick Lacefield, pro-

.ject coordinator of the National
' Mobilization of the Draft.

In cooperation with Washington
D.C.’s\ police department and

‘Capitol guards, fsawhorses had been

set up at the top of the Capitol steps
so demonstrators could not enter
the Capitol building itself.

In addition, traffic was rerouted

by police among Pennsylvania-

 

Avenue so the march to the Capitol,
led by a police captain, could move
safely. However, police were also
prepared for the worst. Dressed in 
riot gear and mounted on horses, 9
they lined the streets with heavy
concentrations in front of the White
House and near the Capitol _-
building. ‘ _ ' '
The organizers of the rally had
told demonstrators that it was to be

750 that voted last year. A lack of communication led to the seemingly ram-
pant wave ' of voter apathy, according to some candidates and CGS
"students. Numerous_prospective voters were turned away at the polls
because they did_n’t know they needed to have their identification cards
with the green validation sticker with them. After being turned away, many

did not return to vote, the candidates added. ‘
President Tom Hajduk was not available for comment on his victory,
but Means previously said that “win or lose, my campaign will have been a
success if I have gotten students interested in the government.”

_,,GoaIs Of Engineers’ Week: Use Skills, Hove Fu

 

By TERESA SOKOL
' Pitt News Staff Writer

If you thought St. Patrick arrived
lasi Monday, you must have been
mistaken since Pitt’s engineers are
awaiting his arrival during the 27th
Annual Engineers’ Week, March
24-29.

St. Patrick’s means of arrival
during the parade is just one of the
suprises planned by the Engineering
Week Planning Committee, accor-
ding to this year’s co-Chairpersons
Liz Aloise and Russ Frydryck.

The main premise of Engineers’
'Week at Pitt is to "give engineering

students time to take a break and to
use the engineering skills they’ve ac-'

quired in some fun and games, said
Aloise-

members of the Planning Commit-
tee have designed a new event called
“Enginuity” that will be held in the
Student Union Recreation Room
on March 25.

_The “enginuity challenge” this
year is to build a paper airplane that
will.carry a medium size egg, noted

.Frydryck. Sound easy? Well, not if

you consider that the airplane may
only be built out of used computer
paper, cotton kite string, and glue!
The event winners will be judged on
distance and time of flight,
Frydryck noted. . A -
Game night on Wednesday,
March 26 will feature a- new
Monopoly board that is over 10 feet

in length, according ‘to the co-'
chairpersons. Crambling. type

(V.

casinos are also setup by each of
the eight engineering departments,
Aloise added. » g i

The theme of Thursday’s parade

is “Pittsburgh Industry” and each e

engineering department has entered
a float representing this year’s
theme. These floats will be judged
and both Frydryck and Aloise said
that the parade is “rumored” to
have some exceptional floats this
year. The highlight of the parade
will be the arrival of St. Patrick
when the parade ends in_ front of
Benedum Hall.

The annual soap box derby on
Lytton Street and “gimmick,”
which features athletic competition
between departments in events like

the five-legged race,» the obstacle:

course, and the traditional t1’1g-o-
war, will be held on Friday, March
28 on the Cathedral lawn. '

Points are awarded during the

events of Engineers’ Week based on
departmental attendance and vic-
tories added Aloise. The depart-
ment with the highest cumulative
score, Aloise said, will win the
Shamrock Award, given at the
Shamrock Ball on Saturday, March

' 29. The site of this year’s ball is the

Syria Mosque; dinner is included
and music will be by Nightstream,
Aloise added.

Engineers’ Week, noted fAloise'
and Frydryck, takes all year to‘

plan,’ and the committee wants to
encourage all/Pitt students to attend
the events. _ - -

“We can't allow the President to

Representative Ted Weiss (Dem,

Representative Robert Kastenmeier
(Dem., Wis.) said. “Do not divide

Bella Abzug, former Represen-

President Carter to “come out of

“I dare him,” she shouted, shak-

But Abzug drew negative
responses from the crowd when she
endorsed Senator Kennedy for the
Presidential ‘nomination, because
she did not want to see President
Carter serve a second term.
“You have to use your power to
vote to defeat Carter,” she said.‘

she said, “We hope both men and

Reverend Barry Lynn, chairman
of the Committee Against Registra-
tion and the Draft (CARD) called
the Selective Service System “the
most inhumane ,. system created in
America in the last 100 years.”

“It is impossible to create a fair
and equitable system,” Rev. Lynn

.said,‘referring to the inequities of ‘

student deferments and occupa-

-tional deferments.

Rev. Lynn also criticized Presi-
dent Carter’s motives for draft
registration as a warning to the Rus-
sians.

“The Russians aren’t losing any
sleep over draft registration,” Lynn

‘ said. “The only people I know who

are losing any sleep are 18- and
19-year olds.”

Musicians included folksinger
Peter Yarrow of the group Peter,
Paul, and Mary, Michael Kessler, a
singer from Tennessee, and the cast
of theplay “Hair.”

The demonstration had all the
flavor of a sixties demonstration,
complete with colorfully painted
faces and burned American flags,
and most of the protesters were in
the age group_that remembered the
demonstrations of the Vietnam era.

There were young children along
with senior citizens, carrying signs
and singing chants with the en-

Anti-Intervention Group Opposes ;,

By SETH LUBOVE '
- Pitt News Staff Writer .

There are indications that the
anti-draft movement is not a group
of individuals who are solely com-
mitted to stopping registration for
the draft, but it is acoalition of
groups ranging from the
Democratic Socialist Organizing
Committee and the Communist
Workers Party to the Americans for

‘Democratic Action.

The Committee Against Interven-
tion, another group opposing draft
registration but ' possessing other
goals along the line of condemna-
tion of "United States and Soviet in-
tervention into Third World coun-
tries, sponsored a discussion Thurs-
day night. The discussion, held in"
David Lawrence Hall,‘ featured
Tom Onieal, ;coordinator of the
Pittsburgh branch of the Commit-
tee Against Registration and the
Draft (CARD).

Due to a conﬂict of schedules,
Rev. Elizabeth Scott, who recently
returned from a trip to Iran and
originally scheduled to speak, was
not able to appear atthe discussion,
but Onieal covered for Scott’s _
absence by presenting his own

arguments against possible United
States interventionin Afghanistan.

The United States is defending a
part of ' theworld “who doesn’t_
even want our military,”‘according
to Onieal,- citing Third World
discontent with United States in-
tervention in any determination of
its future.

“And who are we/going to de-
fend?” Onieal asked, referring to
the Afghanistan peasants. as a group
of “heroin peddlers and oppressors
of women’s rights.”

“If the United States is against
the government in ,Afghanistan

now, what kind of government are

they suggesting for the people of
Afghanistan? What kind of govern-
ment is the United States going to

support in Afghanistan?” Onieal?
_ said.

Onieal also raised military ques-
tions concerning’ the defense of
Middle Eastern oil..fields', referring
to the volatile nature of petroleum
products where no one would
benefit from their destruction.

“It’s hard to conceive of either
the United States or Russia fighting
in an oil field,” Onieal said.

Cheryl Tomko said that she, Hajduk and Huffner will work on getting
an effective lobbying group in Harrisburg. %

“No one as of yet has been able to do that,” she said.

In the past year, the council has opened more offices for the use of the .
CGS students. Tomko would like to see “the night school students have
more of the available services the day school has,” and will work to achieve
that goal.

Tomko also commented that since the three dollar activity fee increase
was not approved, the budget and allocations will be tight.

Dave Huffner, last year’s council president, said he wants to begin a
public relations campaign to change the image that many students, par-
ticularly day students, have concerning the CGS.

“Night and part-time students are looked down upon and viewed as
something different but they’re not,” Huffner said. “They are students
like all other students—as intelligent and dedicated.”

  Springtime at Pitt

It’s springtime at Pitt, a time when the thoughts of
all good college students turn to summer vacations,
spending time away from the books, graduation and
. . .fee increases.

Yes, this spring like all the springs past, Pitt
students face skyrocketing tuition, a reality that this
year rests entirely in the hands of the state’s
lawmakers.

But now students have discovered that they will be
faced with yet another increase with a proposal now

pending before Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs
Conney M. Kimbo to increase the Student Health
fee.

Although the administration refused to quote any
dollar figure for the increase, Student Health Ad-
visory Board Chairman Dawn Gideon said the ad-
ministration is hoping for a $6 increase over the ex-
isting $16 per term fee. p

In the past, the overall effectiveness of the health

' service has been questioned by more than one stu-~

dent. .
A major question in the minds of many is why the
service does not maintain weekend office hours.
Student Health Service Vice Administrator Ron
Eckley said that eight years ago the health service

‘open on weekends, but soon closed because the

center did not receive many patients on the
weekends.

But what about those few students who did call on
the health service on the weekends, those who were in
immediate need of professional medicalcare.

Those students were more than likely‘ eternally
grateful for there being some form of medical
assistance available to them. It is a lonely feeling to

be a freshman in a strange city and be sick knowing '

that the nearest medical aid is all of two days away.

It is true that the health center provides many
valuable services to students, offering laboratory
testing and x-rays and physical examinations aside
from reduced rate prescriptions.

Eh:  News

Page 4——-Monday, March 24, 19800

The question that should be on the minds of Kim-
bo and other administrators is whether the location
of the university, directly across the street from
Western Pennsylvania’s largest health complex, real-
ly dictates the necessity of a duplicate service on cam-
pus.

Kimbo should consider whether it is really fair to
students in these times of the ever dwindling dollarto
be forced to pay an even higher mandatory fee if any
at all for services that many students already pay for
via their parents hospitalization plans. These plans
usually entitle students to the same services provided
by the health center plus specialized services not of- “
fered by the Student Health Center.

For some students it is actually closer and more

convenient to go to one of these hospitals rather than
going to the student health center and then being
referred to a hospital. Surely, there is some alter-
native to forcing students to pay for duplicate ser-
vices by revamping the existing health service to in-
clude a plan covering those services not included in
most hospitalization plans.
' At this time we offer Kimbo a three-fold sugges-
tion: l)To examine not only the possibility of a
health fee increase, but also the usage of the current
fee. 2)To investigate the overall necessity of an on-
campus health service in its present form, and 3)To
determine if it is fair to impose a mandatory fee on
students already holding a comparable if not more
complete hospitalization plan. »

Ethnicity in 19805 Americo—Alive and Well Despite Changes 5

By JOSEPH C. HEIM

Another'Saint Patrick’s Day has
just passed- Saint Patrick’s Day
has become an American holiday,
even though it started as an Irish
holiday and transcended to an Irish
American holiday. ,It is a celebra-
tion of ethnicity, though the status
of what relevance ethnicity has in
America in the 1980s is still unclear.

The New American History

defines ethnicity as, “Of or pertain-

ing to a social group within a
cultural and social system that
claims or is accorded special status
on the basis of complex, often
variable traits including many char-
acteristics such as history. But is
such a force existent in American

I society in the 19803?

American society sprang from a

_diverse stream of ethnicity,

predominantly European in origin,
in the early 20th century. Other
ethnic groups had arrived earlier.
In the popular history, America
became known as the “melting
pot,” where all were formed into
Americans. This popular version of
"history was held for quite a length

A of time."

However, it was not wholly ac-
curate.‘ Such groups did lose their

    -°".9.‘f‘*?‘.i<1£**.1titv.»*W.n9t.who11v- As

  
   

Moynihan and Glazer remark, in
“Beyond the Melting Pot,” groups
became hybridized such as Afro-
Americans, who although not inte-
grated or assimilated into the
American mainstream, were still
different than their kinsmen re-
maining in the old homeland. Thus,
the melting pot is not true. But it
has been over twenty years since
Moynihan and Glazer’s classic
work, and their work, while
remaining insightful, is not
necessarily applicable to today’s
American society. '

In regard to the earlier question,
there is no one single answer to the
question whether ethnicity is on the
rise in American society in 1980.
One cannot generalize.

The earlier (those groups where
the majority» arrived early in this
century or earlier) arriving ethnic
groups have assimilated, but this
must be qualified. The assimilation
has been cultural, to a degree, as
opposed to structural. The dif-
ference between the two is minute
yet profound.

Many of those in the above areas
have retained some customs or
cultural vestiges, often as a result of
ethnic organizations. Yet, they all

_ha.Ve, for .the..'most part, accepted

   

the “mass culture.” Very few re-
ject apple pie, Chevrolet and
M¢D0f1ald’s or public schools.
After three or four generations,

identification with a historical-

homeland is’ tenuous at best in
today’s America. There may be an
identification with a cultural
organization, but not necessarily
with a previous homeland which
one may have never seen. Thus,

there has been a degree of cultural,

assimilation, in that there is no
wholesale. rejection of American
culture. '
This does, however, occur in
varying degrees. For example, the
newest immigrant ethic groups, the
Chinese and Mexican—Americans,
are likely to have exhibited less of a

cultural assimilation.

Structural assimilation has not
occurred to the same degree. Eth-
nicity in some cases, such as the
Mexican-American, is still often
complementary with socioeconomic
status. The lower social groups
often consist of large percentages of
certain ethnic groups. This is as
true today as when Charles Silber-
man wrote his “Crisis in Black and
White.” Granted, there have been
‘many government and private

initiatives in this area, but the above

is likely to remain a fact.

Some groups, though accepting
certain elements of cultural
assimilation, have still resisted
structural assimilation as a matter
of choice, though they, in reality,
just as some other groups, may not
have really had the choice. Gold-
stein, in the September, 1979, issue
of “Ethnicity,” believes this point
is especially true of certain Jewish
groups, those being primarily of an
orthodox nature.

Thus, ethnicity is alive in the
1980s in America, but it is much
like a chameleon, Occasionally
standing out, sometimes in comple-
ment with other variables,
sometimes not. .. Ethnic groups have
been affected by both cultural and
structural assimilation in a differen-
tial manner to the degree that,
although perhaps not the same in
composition as in years past, it is
still possible to speak out about
ethnic groups in America.

I By CAS Dean  

Recent editorials in‘ The Pitt
News have suggested that self-

ﬁdesigned majors in the College are

*being eliminated. That rumor is un-
It is true that some

students who have self-designed
majors have had serious problems.
Faculty advisers often . disappear,

' leaving the student stranded. The

guidelines for self-designed majors
are unclear. Often the courses the
student intends to take are no
longer available when he wants
them. CAS Council is now address-
ing these and other issues. We hope
to improve the self-designed major
in ways that'will make it an even
more attractive and rewarding op-
tion for students in the future.

* The Pantherette gymnastics team

-._finished a disappointing sixth at
eastern regionals at Penn State.
This resounding defeat extinguished
all hopes of the Pantherettes for a
bid to nationals this year. Last
year, Pitt’ ﬁnished third at easterns
and ninth at nationals.

Penn State won the eastern title
‘amassing 148.55 points, West
‘Virginia was second with 135.7,
Massachusetts third with 134.35,
Yale fourth with 132.7 and New
Hampshire fifth with 132.4. Pitt
scored 131.55 points.

teams with higher seasonal averages

would be coming along later.”

Pirates Beat White Sox in Grapefruit League Action

By The Associated Press

BRADENTON, Fla. — Second
baseman Phil Garner and Pirate
Captain Willie Stargell slugged
three hits apiece to lead Pittsburgh
to a 5-3 win yesterday over the
Chicago White Sox in exhibition

I  ' 2 baseball.

. Withthe win, the World Series
champions leveled their record at
.5-5. ‘Chicago dropped to 6-7 with

who place 13th with a 33.75, while
Evans was 15th with 33.25 and
Tressler 20th with 32.5.

“We didn’t have a great meet,“

. said Sanft. “With the way we were

\

performing, we wouldn’t have been
able to place third even without the
problems with the judges.’i

The highlight for the Pantheret-

, tes was the uneven bars, where Mar-

tino and Evans made it to the finals.
In the regular competition, Evans
scored an 8.65 and Martino had an
8.7. .In the finals, Evans had an 8.7
while Martino scored an 8.8. Both
gymnasts barely missed making all-
East, each by one-tenth of a point
or less.

In vaulting, Myra Bachuchin had
an 8.6, Gretchen Speich an 8.6 and
Martino and Evans were the high
scorers for Pitt with an 8.7 and 8.65

, respectively. According to Sanft,

they both should have scored nearer
to a 9.0.

On the balance beam, Tressler,
Martino and Evans all hit their
routines and had no falls, according
to Sanft. However, they scored
much lower than the coach_ ex-
pected, all scoring under 8.5. Karen
Zandi also hit her routine, but
scored only a 7.0.

In the final event, the floor exer-
cise, Sanft said the women were
underscored, from all the teams.
Tressler and Martino, who usually
score between 8.8 and 8.9 had only
an 8.2 and 8.15. Zandi had her
season high in this event, an 8.05.

“The scores were so low that the

audience booed enough to stop the '

meet, ’ ’ Sanft said.

The Pantherettes will not qualify
to nationals as a team, but accor-
ding to the coach, Tressler, Martino
and Evans could qualify individual-
ly. .

The White Sox took a 2-0 lead in
the top of the fifth on singles by
Ray Torres and Alan Bannister.
The Pirates responded with three
runs in the bottom of the inning to
take a 3-2 lead.

Pirates Dale Berra and Rod

rors. Garner drove them in with a_

The White Sox tied the game 3-3

But the Pirates took the lead for
good in the bottom of the seventh,
scoring two runs. Garner drove in
Tim Foli and then crossed home‘
plate on a single by Stargell.

Chicago ‘ third baseman Kevin

Bell led his team with three.

, Pittsburgh’s Larry Demery, 1-0,

6-1 for their fifth straight exhibition
triumph.

Ken Reitz drove in three runs for
St. Louis with a two-run single and
a sacrifice ﬂy. The 30-year-old
Forsch, the Cards’ starter, scattered
six Phildelphia hits.

Phils’ left-hander Randy ‘Lerch-

surrendered two walks and a single
in the second inning preceding
Reitz’ one-out single, a blow which
established a 2-0 St.. Louis lead.

Louisville and UCLA Collide For  Chanpionship

By the Associated Press

_ It began about three weeks ago
with 48 teams from every part of
‘the nation. Now it is down to two
teams who will meet tomorrow
night at Market Square Arena in In-

" V gdianapolis to decide the NCAA

champion.

In yesterday’s first game, fourth-
ranked Louisville, the only top-ten
team in. the final four, defeated
Iowa, 80-72. The second game pit-

_ ted ‘UCLA and Purdue, with the

Bruins winning 67-62.

A key in UCLA’s victory was the
play of senior Kik-e Vandeweghe, as
he effectively controlled Purdue’s
All-America center Joe Barry Car-

_rol. It’s, difficult to totally shut
down a player of Carrol’s ability
. but Vandeweghe neutralized him by

" 9...-4
, ,,, ,.

., ,vei'y ; aggressive play- Vandeweghe.

finished with 24 points as compared
to Carrol’s 17.

. UCLA took a 33-25 halftime lead
over the Boilermakers, which was
extended to ten points midway
through the second half. Purdue
fought back to within one point late
in the game. Then with 3:21 to go,
UCLA’s Mike Sanders hit two free
throws to give the Bruin’s a 59-56
lead. Sanders again hit two foul-
shots with, 1:51 left for a 61-58
Bruin advantage. Purdue closed the
gap on their next trip down the

‘ court as Carrol scored on a goal-

tending call to make it 61-60. Then
with 53_ seconds remaining,
freshman Michael Holton cboly
sank two free throws to putUCLA
ahead to stay, 63-60.

Despite the fact that UCLA was a

much smaller team than Purdue,’

~.  . 4
‘ \ A ' .
Pr-—--o ..—- ! ..._....._ -..-

the Bruins " outrebounded the
Boilermakers 22-20 in the first half
and the teams tied for the game,
52-52. "
Besides‘Vandeweghe, the Bruin
philosophy against the 7-foot-1-
inch center Carrol was to send in

several players and let them take '

turns pushing and shoving. James
Wilks, 6-7, Sanders, 6-6, and Dar-
rell Allums, 6-9, were all involved in
the action against Carroll. As a
result, Purdue had, trouble getting
the ball to their center.

The other semi-final was virtually
a one—man show as Louisvi1le’s
Darrell Griffith sank and slammed.
in 32 points, ,18 in the first half
alone. Grifﬁth’s performance led
the Cardinals to a 34-29 halftime

\

lead. ,

Iowa’s star, Ronnie Lester, met a_v

different fate than did Griffith.
With 7:47 to go in the first half, the
Hawkeye guard hurt his right knee
while falling to the floor after a
drive to the basket. Lester’s impor-
tance to Iowa is shown in the fact
that, while he is in the lineup, the
Hawkeyes lost only once; while not
playing, they are a .500_ballclub.
Louisville seemed to put the game
away with 7:03 left in the game as
they built up a 66-55 lead.
However, Iowa, who got here by
beating the East's two best teams in
Syracuse and Georgetown, refused
to die as the Hawkeye’s scored the
next six points to make it 66-61.
Iowa’s Bob Hansen scored with
3:52 remaining to bring the
Hawkeye’s,within four points. That
was to be the last gasp -as Derek

Smith and. Jerry Eaves-xscored

within twenty seconds to _ put the
Cardinals in command 70-63.
Freshman Rodney McCray back-

‘ed up Griffiths 32 points with 14 of ’

his own. Iowa was led by Kenny Ar-
nold with 20 and Vince Brookins
with 14 points.

Tourney hoops: UCLA with nine
losses, could set a record for most
losses by a tournament champion,
if they beat Louisville. The record is
presently seven losses by Al
McGuire’s Marquette War-
riors. . .Iowa finished the season
with a 22-9 record-. . .Purdue
finishes with ‘ a 22-10
record. . .Louisville comes in with
the most wins in the nation with

Pitt Tennis Team Aced in First
Competition of Year, Finish Last

By MIKE DICHIARA
Pitt News Ass’t Sports Editor

The Pitt tennis team opened their
season on a disappointing note,
finishing last in a four team tourna-
ment in Washington D.C. The four
teams which gathered for the
George Washington Invitational
Tennis Tournament were host
G.W., Boston University, West
Virginia and Pitt. This was also the
ﬁnal standings of the entrants.

The Panthers were first matched .

up against George Washington and
were shut-out 9-0. Pitt just couldn’t
manage to get untracked against the
Colonials, losing all six singles mat-

ches and three doubles.

Coach George Dieffenbach said,
“We lost a lot of three set matches.
With more experience and competi-
tion, that should be improved.”

Pitt next played Boston Universi-
ty and did a little better, winning
two of the nine matches. For Pitt,
Doug White won his singles match
over B.U.’s Larry Small. The match
score was 1-6, 6-2, 6-2. Then in
doubles, White teamed with , Kim
Roberts to defeat B.U.’s Matt Dat-
ta and Tim Heath by a score of 7-6,_
6-7, 6-4.

Pitt’s final opponent was WVU
and the Mountaineer’s defeated the

George Veronis by a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3
count. _

Then Pitt’s Kevin Quay defeated’
Scott Munro 3-6, 6-2, 7-5 for the
Panthers other victory.

Dieffenbach said afterwards, “I
was disappointed by the results but
encouraged by the play of the team.
They exhibited strength in the top
three positions and then adrop off .
in depth. Overall, everybody was
competitive. ’ ’

“Once the season gets well under

Panther

' By STEVE THOMAS
Pitt News Staff Writer

For Scott Winkler, growing up
around pools early in life did not
necessarily mean he would develop
into just a great swimmer. As he
approached ninth grade, you could
say he was involved in a kind of
“survival of the ﬁttest”~competi-
tion at North Hills High School.

“It was like the ninth graders ver-
sus the seniors,” said Winkler.
‘_‘Don Geyer was my first swimming
coach, and in ninth grade, I met
Rich Morris. He started me in real

\ diving, and I found I had more suc-

cess in giving than swimming.”
Winkler went on to achieve All-

_ American status his next two years

while diving with the AAU National
team.

“Al Coffey was the diving coach
at Pitt during those years,” said
Winkler. “When I visited Pitt, I
liked it and knew Pitt was always
great in diving. My parents were
very supportive in my upbringing,
and if I attended Pitt, they could

watch me dive. I always wanted to

do well for them.”

When Winkler enrolled at Pitt,

.he was quite aware that the road

ahead would be_one of intense com-
petition among the divers.

“Competition makes you
better,” said Winkler. “I still have
it with Pat Greenwell. It’s wonder-
ful‘ to be able to compete with

‘_ friends on a competitive basis.”

' As a freshman, Winkler wasted
little time in gaining respect among
America’s most prominent divers.
He was a finalist in the Eastems as
well as being an NCAA qualifier,
and during his sophomore season,
was named the Most Outstanding
Diver at the Eastern Champion-
ships, quite an honor for a
sophomore. He also journeyed to
the NCAAs again that year accom-
panied by the title, “Eastern Diving
Champion.” '

At the outset of his junior year,
Winkler promptly set records in
three-meter diving and dove to two
second place ﬁnishes, while ill. His
biggest victory came against Ohio
State when he defeated All-America
Stew Eberle.

“It was really great beating
him,” said Winkler. “I really felt
good all over.”
Winkler injured his leg after quali-
fying for the nationals.

“It was a big letdown,”  -
Winkler. “I worked out with the. ' A 

swimmers doing heavy nautilus

training under Fred Lewis, our ' 

swimming coach.”

"Winkler recovered though, and or A
new in‘ his ﬁnal year at Pitt, has _
reaped yet another reward. In.
beating Ohio State this year, he set .

new records on both boards, as

Pitt’s divers went undefeated all ' 

year.

“If I didn’t win, Pat (Greenwell)
did,” said Winkler. “There are so

many divers, and I would have been ‘ I I

fortunate to win just one of those
spots,” said _Winkler, referring to
his victories in the one- and three-
meter diving events against OSU,
when he was once again chosen as
‘Most Outstanding Diver.’

Glancing back at his career here,
Winkler is grateful he attended Pitt.

“I’ve been very successful here,” _

said Winkler. “I’ve helped the
team out, made friends, and have

had the best years of my life here.‘ .

Rookie diving coach Julian Krug is
outstanding, enthusiastic, and a
great person.’ We got the best one
when we got Julian. He has coach-
ed many all-Americans. Overall,

my four years under Lewis, Krug, ‘ — 1
and Bradshaw have been really ’ \

rewarding. I couldn’t have spent
my four years any better. Pitt is
just a fine school.” '

There is one goal left, which is -

finally within Wink1er’s reach.

_“My all-time goal is to be 

NCAA all-America,” said Winkler.. . V
“I think I can do it and I think allot '

of our own swimmers can do. it. 
what we have worked for.”-

After graduation, Winkler plans?" I" H: I
to attend dental school at Pitt, and

just might be the first dentist to’

someday receive the “most out-, ~\

standing dentist” award, to go
alongside his diving awards.

People are fanatics when it comes to their Pilot Razor Pointp

wig.

— They‘re reluctant to give them up. And when someone borrows one. 1

what happens is inevitable.

First, they love the way it writes. Really smooth and extra—ﬁne. They
go wild over its clever metal collar that helps keep the point from going
squish. Naturally they "forget" to give it back. although it's only 79¢.

This can be very embarrassing when they're caught in the act.

Others have pocketed Pilot's Fineliner pen, The one with the slightly

less delicate stroke. it's only 69¢.

So if you bor row someones Razor

Point or Fineliner pen
you'd better
be prepared
to pay the
consequences.
But, for much less than a ‘
dollar. you'd be smart
to buy your own.

From the Editors . . A.

To our readers,

Approximately one year ago on March
28, 1979, SHOWCASE Magazine was in-
troduced as the entertainment supplement
of The Pitt News. Today we gratefully
celebrate its anniversary with_ knowledge
that SHOWCASE has succeeded where
‘many other supplements have failed. It has

I passed its predecessor, 5th Avenue, and all

previous supplements of The Pitt News, not

only with one solid year of, publication, but 5

with, we feel, a higher quality comprehen-

siveness and timeliness of entertainment

coverage. ~ .

We wish to make clear. our indebtedness
to the founder of SHOWCASE, current
editor-in-chief Steve Guidas. Equally deser-
ving are the original editor, Mark Holan,
and Assistant Editor Forrest Buffenmyer,
both of whom still work with the magazine
in some capacity. They were pivotal in the
facilitation of SHOWCASE, and for their
experience and insight that has proven in-
valuable in the past year, we would like to
say thank you, and the best of luck in your

future endeavors. V _
As the newly appointed editors, we Wlll

continue to maintain the ideals that have
made SHOWCASE the unique magazine it
is today, while still striving and progressing
to expand our horizons and build upon our
solid editorial foundation. The youth of
the magazine prohibits us from making cer-
tain gains, but with time and persistence we
expect to eliminate» these problems and
move ever onward.

vMost important, however, are our
readers. Without you, SHOWCASE
Magazine would have long ago collapsed.
Our goal is to keep those people who read
.SHO WCASE regularly, while still being
able to attract new patrons with every issue.
Please feel free to write us or stop in our of-
fice on the fourth floor (417) of Schenley

_ Hall.

SHOWCASE is a student organization
and open to all interested and enthusiastic
writers, photographers, or just anyone with
a good idea. We are thriving on your in-
terest. Signed,

music and attitude.

Rock ‘n’ roll HAS usually sided with
blood and guts in any Man versus machine

albeit cautiously, as if it was the alien who
has long made its presence known, but only
now chooses to be examined. We must no
longer afford ourselves the self-indulgent
luxury of wallowing in the safety zones that
groups like the thieving Knack and just-for-
fun Rockpile make so comfortable. Those

who repeat the past are condemned to live

in it. ’

Allfthrough last ‘week I awaited the Pat
Metheny concert with increasing anticipa-
tion; however on Saturday night (March 22)
I was sorely disappointed. I

I did not expect to sacrifice every bit of
comfort in order to sit in an over-crowded
hall with very little if any stage visibility.

When we arrived at the concert I learned
that only 900 chairs had been set up while at
least l200J.ickets had been sold. Given the
intolerable conditions and the high price of
theltickets, I felt I had beencheated out of
$13.

The Pat Metheny concert could have
been both memorable and enjoyable had
the promoters at Duquesne not put their
profit so far aheadof the public’s.

  Karen Allen a

By DYLAN WILLIAMS

Karen Allen sat in her chair with
her knees propped against the table,
playing with a white pen and look-
ing toward the ceiling as she spoke
about her personal relationship to
the character of Jessica in her latest
film, A Small Circle of Friends.

“At 18, I know I wasn’t like
Jessica. At least not totally. She is
someone who gives off the feeling
of having been everywhere and seen
everything. She seems to have a
premonition of situations,’ and
always knows the right thing to say.
That’s not me. '

“I can identify with her drive,
though,” saidthe 28-year-old ac-
tress. “Once she puts her mind to
something, she sees it through. She
is someone who is like me internal-
ly, though outwardly we express
ourselves in different ways.”

Karen put her mind to acting at
the age of 19. “I left home
(Washington, D.C.) at 17. I was
close to my family but, you know,”
she said, gesturing to the air with
her hands. “I sang for a while with
my two sisters up until then, but I
found that singing was just too -
much fun for me to ever put in the
work needed to become a profes-
sional. So I went to college (George
Washington University) and studied
psychology, dance, and literature, A

“Than at 19, I toured South _
America and saw the Polish Theater
Companyand, even though the en-
tire production was in Polish, I felt
such an intensity of expression in
what I saw that I knew right then
that I wanted to be an actress.”‘

Karen tried out and won a part in
the play Saint after returning to
Washington, D.C.

“I was terrified at first,” she ad-
mitted, her eyes growing wide, “but
once you know you can do it, you
want to do it forever. So pretty
soon the fear turned into a type of
energy, and from this energy there
came, slowly, a little of the excite-
ment of acting.” The pen was
apart now, the cartridge, the spring,
and the two outside pieces lying on
the table. Karen shrugged and

34%,

started putting it back together.
“I used to write,” she said. “It
’ always amazed me how people

could make something out of
nothing, like writers do, Acting is
the same way, although I like acting
better because it’s done by col-
laborating with others, rather than‘
just between myself and a piece of
paper.” A *

Brad Davis came in with a box of
clothes from the cleaners, smiled,
and lay down on the couch behind
Karen’s chair. He was dressed in
.blue jeans, a gray short-sleeved
sweatshirt, and a scarf. He had
gotten his hair cut short since the
movie. ,

Moving to the subject of women
in films, Karen continued, “It’s
frustrating. So many of the parts
just aren’t real. No one is writing
good scripts for women right now.
They were a little while ago with
films like Julia’, but not now. ,

“Take my role in Cruising (where
she plays Al Pacino’s girlfriend).
That was so one-dimensional. It
made me angry, but—” she
gestured with her hands again as if
to express everything she couldn’t
say.

“Harvard made me angry,” said
Brad, sitting up. “They"threw us

out. "Can you believe that?”

During one scene in the movie,
Jessica hangs a war mural from one
of the buildings at Harvard.

“That’s why they threw us out,”
said Brad- “They knew we were
going to do it. They read the
script,.but they still threw us‘ out
like we were a bunch of protesting
hippies from the 60's.” Brad got up
and paced around the room.

“They were really narrow-minded
. about it. It surprised me just how
little things have changed.”

Davis, who won the Golden _
Globe Award for Best Male Acting
Debut of 1978 for his performance

'in Midnight Express, sees his role in
this film as pivotal in his movie
career. W

“They were both intense‘
characters (Leo and Billy), but one
was aggressively intense and the
other was more passive. They were
at different ends of the spectrum. I
knew Leo would be a challenge
after Midnight Express.” Davis
moved around constantly as he
spoke, always seeming to have other
things on his mind. Karen and he
joked about their singing ability,
about Brad’s brother, who plays a

_ transvestite in Cruising, (“Yes, my

 

test Film

brother the drag queen,” said
Davis, waving his scarf) and about
the draft scene in the movie where
all the men have to drop their
drawers.

“Was that you or a stand in?’f
Karen asked him. V

“That’s what I like, a nice tight
cast,” said director Rob Cohen,
entering with a bunch of grapes,
Marlboros for Brad, and Vantages '
for Karen. “This was a love and
friendship film, so a lot of good
things came out of it. When you
film a movie like The Exorcist,
weird things happen. There are
always cameras breaking for no
reason and‘sets burning down. But
in a film like this, everything stays
‘together. .

“I tried to set up an atmosphere
where everyone could contribute
their ideas,” said the bearded direc-
tor. “I don’t like to squash people’s’
creativity, or be hardnosed about
the way things should be done,

though in the end the decisions were.

mine.” Karen and‘Brad both agreed
this made work more enjoyable.
“This was important since we ap-
proached the film on a human,
rather than political, level,” said
Cohen. “Some of the language was

» looped for eventual television air-

ing, too. We substituted strong
sentences where swear words in-
terfered with important scenes.”

Room service entered with cham-
pagne. Cohen, a young director at
30, continued, sharing his own
closeness with the film.

"I wasn’t really that close to The
Wiz. I guess first because I wasn’t
black and second because I didn’t
live in Oz. But I did go through the’
60s and I did go to Harvard, so I
felt much closer to this film. I just
hope our nation can pull together
and avoid the narcissism that the
60s had.” I" ' ,

Cohen passed his grapes around
the room. By the time they got to
Brad, there was nothing left but the
stem.

“That’s all right, large circle of
friends,” he said, uncorking a bot-
tle. “I like these grapes better,
anyway.”

Pitt Electronic Music Concert
Frick Fine Arts Auditorium
March 27, 1980

Pitt Music Professor Robert Mor-
ris is excited.

Last September he introduced a
dozen or so students to the
fascinating world of electronic
music and this week they are staging
a concert. Staging, because much
of the repertoire lies in theatrics.
Concert, because instruments are
played (many of which are not syn- "
thesizers) and because individual
electronic music works will be
presented.

Morris calls the performance a
“culmination” of the efforts his
class has reached in “merging the
often technical world of science in a

—-meaningful way with a musical com-
position.” - 

From his exuberance one can
assume they have succeeded.

“I’m really looking forward to
the concert,” Morris says en-
thusiastically.

And what extravaganza it will be.
The class of electronic music
students have a unique idea in ,
mind: to provide a total sensual ex-
perience to the audience. Among

sight, smell, taste, and possibly even
touch,‘ depending on the mood of
the audience. There will also be a
hint, of the erotic. Some of the
events planned rely on yet another
sense—humor.

Incorporated within this contract
is an often ethereal, often intense
series of episodes which mirrors the
types of experiences encountered on
a day-to-day basis. Threaded
throughout, of course, will be doses
of experimental music.

The tentative title of the master- I
piece is “Impossible I
Combinations.” As suggested,
several dichotomous events will be
presented, and it will be part of the
audience’s job to detect them.»

Also, the concertgoers may beiasked
to participate‘ actively in the piece.

The first half of the concert. will

consist of the public debuts of the ~ _

students’ electronic compositions,
which are all entirely different, deal-
ing with the original textural varia-
tions to be found in music.

at 8:30 p.m. on Thursday, Mar. 27.

snowcxsr Interview

By MARK HOLAN A

Ben Shaktman is the General
Director of the’Pittsburgh Public
Theater, currently celebrating its
fifth season as Pittsburghx only
regional theater company.

InNew York, Shaktman has stag-
ed productions both on Broadway
and Off-Broadway. His production

.of."Good Day at the Theatre de
Lyons won an Obie for best Off-

~ ;Broadway production. In 1977 he
was named Man Of The Year in

_ Pittsburgh Theater by the Pitt-
sburgh Jaycees.

This SHOWCASE INTERVIEW

was the first Shaktman has granted ,
to‘ a collegiate publication.

SHOWCASE: This first question" is
terribly obvious, but /there’s been
some controversy recently about the
PPT’s production of Sam Shep-
pard’s Buried Child. How will your
stand against the media and subse-
quent appeal to subscribers and
potential patrons to “make up their
- own minds” affect the PPT?
SI-IAKTMAN: The so-called con-
.troversy stimulated by the responses
to Buried Child, was, I think, the
healthiest thing that’-s happened in
Pittsburgh theater since the birth of
the Public Theater. There is no
campaign against the media. It was
never an attempt, in a sense, to
criticize the critics. It_ was allowing
the Public Theater to express its
own‘ voice to its own audience, to
' have them read the critics and then
have them do the most important
things, and that is to make up their
own mind. It has aroused a ’
tremendous letter writing response
from our subscribers and people
who aren’t our subscribers. They
are being very critical of some of
‘ the plays we’ve produced and very
supportive of Buried Child.

All it shows, I think, is that
there’s no business like show
business. It’s a live
medium—professional theater—and
you can’t please all the people all
the time unless you give them white
bread. And people are getting
bored with white bread. I think the
critics helped open up a tremendous
can of vitamin pills, not a can of
worms.

SHOWCASE: What made you
decide to do Macbeth? There had
been talk at the end of last season
that you were thinking of Hamlet.
SHAKTMAN: Macbeth has been
one of the projects we’ve been con-
sidering since 1976 with Tom
Atkins.‘ ~Tom has wanted to play A
the lead role and his schedule and
our schedule finally gelled for him
to make the commitment that’s re-I

scheduled Macbeth (opening April
9). ' .

I chose to direct it because Tom
and I agreed on the basic thrust of
the play for today’s audience. I
became committed to it emotionally
in November of 1979 because I felt
that I had to find some way to
understand what was happening in

. Tehran. Shakespeare the poet,
‘ Shakespeare the political writer, and
Shakespeare the creator of great

roles on Lou Grant, Skag, and the

traordinary commitment of two
women: Joan Apt and Margaret
Rieck. They are responsible for the
birth’ of Pittsburgh theater—they
and the hundreds of people who
believed in them. I’m a profes-
sional theater maker. Having
grown up in the fifties and studied
the prospect of permanent theatrical
work, rather than gypsying as— a
director, I had a dream of being .
ableto create my own vision of a
theatrical ensemble, a theatrical in-

 

our subscribers, not all of them,
seem to have _a very personal stake
in their Public Theater.

' ‘SHOWCASE: If we commissioned

a painter,-to do a landscape of Pitts-
burgh Theater and told him it had
to include .a river, the finished can-
vas might well have the Public. A
Theater and Heinz Hall’s Broadway
Series on one side and the alter-
native and collegiate companies on
the other side. Do you see a bridge
in this painting? ,,If so, who is cross-
ing it and how often? If not, why
not?  ‘
SHAKTMAN: I think it’s an ar-
bitrary question and I think it’s a
bad painting. There is no real rela-
tionship between‘ the Broadway
series and the Public Th‘eater’s
repertoire. Most of the university
repertoire is more classically
oriented than the Public Theater’s.

I think it’s an artificial sketch.
For the sake of categorizing things
it may be convenient to’ lump the

If Shaktman’s Vision Propels Pittsburgh Theater

Broadway series and the Public
Theater because of the size of our
budgets. But that’s all. There is no
commonality.

What there is, however, is an in-
creasing richness of theatrical op-
portunity for the people of Pitts-
burgh. They can go to Theater Ex-
press and see a play End Game that
is entirely different in its texture
and tone than when they go to see
Deathtrap at Heinz Hall. Then if

. they had enough time they could

come to see Buried Child at Pitts-
burgh Public Theater. They could
go to Pitt and see this extraordinary

. extravaganza that (Attilio) Favorini

has created that no commercial
theater could ever afford to mount.
So in a week of theater-going in
1980 in the snowy month of March,
if you had the time, the money and
the energy, you could see five or six
widely varying kinds of theatrical
experiences.

So the painter should paint a col-
lage, not a split.
SHOWCASE: What is your
relationship with the collegiate and
independent theater companies in
Pittsburgh? Do you think that
yourself and other important theater
ﬁgures in the city should be making
consolidated efforts to form a real
Pittsburgh Theater Alliance?
SHAKTMAN: The relationship of
the Public Theater to the other
theatrical activities is, I’d like to
think, very supportive. We ask
them for support andwe respond
whenever they ask us for support.
I’d like to feel there’s a synergy bet-
ween the Public Theater as a fairly
large-budget institutional operation
and the other groups. Small com-
pany/large company hasnothing to

4 do with good theater/bad theater.

There’s been very exciting work
done since 1975, several groups»
have been spawned here. And I
don’t think it is, as some people I
say, because of the Public Theater.
I think Pittsburgh is a’ city whose
time theatrically is coming.

As far as the collegiate theater
goes, I hope that we are a source of
great excitement and living educa-
tion and living challenge. We have
the worst studentrush record of any
regional theater in America. I don’t
know why the students aren’t com-
ing. I can’t believe it’s because the
plays don’t attract them-. I certainly
think the Public Theater has got to
explore why more and morestudents
afén’t coming. I also think that
teachers of drama and students of
drama have got to analyze why

- they’re not coming toe-a theater that

is being attended by students and
professors from 250 miles away and
is being recognized by local,
regional, and national critics as a
theater at least to be reckoned with.
I think that’s one of our 1980-81
challenges; to find out how we can

I build a better bridge to the students.

But we can’t make them walk it.
SHOWCASE: I've heard from a
reliable source that ‘you’ve given
David Crawford (Stavrogin in Pitts-
burgh Lab Theater’s The Possessed
an Equity contract for Macbeth. Is
that correct? ‘
SHAKTMAN: (sharply) None of
your business. That’s private
business of the Pittsburgh‘ Public
Theater. Why are you asking that?
SHOWCASE: I want to know what
your opinion of local theater talent
is.
SHAKTMAN: Improving! Really '
improving. There’s more and more
opportunities for them to perform
now. More andmore people are
looking to theaters like the Public,
Theatre Express, Iron Clad, Metro
and all the others as perhaps a place
to get some work. The Pittsburgh

Writer Beatts Whips Audience With One-Liners

Ann- Beatts writes for Saturday
Night Live. She is as weird as some
of the sketches you see on the
show. She came to Pitt recently to
speak to stu_dents about comedy,
being a writer, and in her own way,
life in these United States.

“Don’t you think McDonald’s
cheats a little on the numbers?”
she said in the Schenley Hall
Ballroom. “Do you remember the
Beatles? Y’know, Paul
McCartney’s back-up group before
Wings...” She asked the audience,
“You’ve got to remember
Watergate. . .the five-part TV
series?”

She made most of us laugh last
Monday night. She said a week ago
last Friday that she would remind
the crowd, even warn them, that she
is not Chevy Chase. “Neither are '
you.” A small number in the
crowd knew that, but many people
who came to see her thought that
they would get a glimpse of Billy
Murray or Gilda Radner of one of
the other Not-Ready-For-Prime-

, Time Players. She had to tell them

at the beginning of the lecture that
it was all right to laugh. “In fact, I
encourage it.”

Everyone was nervous. They
didn’t know what to expect, _
because so many thought she was
going to act out a scene from a
“Coneheads” sketch, as the"Pitt,

Union Program Council had put on .

the posters and newspaper ads for
the event. “I didn’t write or create
the ‘Coneheads.’ Tom Davis and
Danny Aykroyd wrote the sketches.
Everyone makes mistakes, I guess,”

she told the crowd. .

“It’s really a mysterious way we
have of picking guests for the
show,” she said in private. “No
one person does it, we all put in our
ideas, and Alan (Zwiebel) and
Lorne (Michaels), both producers of
the show, decide according to who
has an open schedule for a given _
week.” ,

At the lecture, she told a captive
audience what kind of experience it
is for most hosts on the show.
“Candice Bergen did a show with
us and said that working with us is
a lot like being kidnapped. A lot of

hosts come back. It’s not for the

money, either. They just like being
close to their kidnappers, I guess.
Y’know, the Stockholm
Syndrome.”

You'd be shocked at the amount
of money that the hosts don’t get.
They stay at Berkshire Place for a
week for free. It’s live. There’s no
retakes or time to get somebody’s
best profile.”

She pulled no punches before,
during, or after the lecture. She
.walked around Schenley Hall hours
before the lecture wearing a
“Groucho” mask. She fit in well
with the scenery of Pitt students.
Many students just thought that it
was some off-beat coed parading
around trying to get attention.
From 12:30 in the afternoon last
Monday until the time of the lec-
ture, KDKA-TV’s Evening

l Magazine kidnapped her. After the
« program‘ council’s mistress of

ceremonies introduced the main
event, Beatts came out in a loose
wool sweater, ultra-tight pants, and

P.U;P.Ci. Nightclub
Student Union Ballroom
March 13, 1980

Just recently, the Pitt Union Pro-
gram Council presented another of
a series of successful events:

a nightclub, complete with come-
dienne, rhythm and blues vocalist
(with accompanists), and ,
refreshments. Everything was right
for a relaxing Thursday night with
entertainment so dynamic as to per-
mit one’s mind to believe that one

, was in Las Vegas.

The nightclub got off‘ to a fast-
paced start when Nancy Parker, a
witty, curly-haired blonde corne-
dienne from New York, took con-
trol of her audience with the first
several jokes. From then on,—she
never lost her rapport, bringing up
and poking fun at well-remembered

‘ events from childhood, including

Catholic Girls" High (because we
always were,Parker quips), the
school nurse (and her inability to do
anything for, you except make you
tea), and _the prevalent ritual known
as the high school dance (Parker
slips into her New York City
schoolgirl character and relates to
her girlfriend that “something fun-
ny happened” to her dancing part-
ner when she drew close to him for
a slow dance).

The donning of many different

voices and characters in her routines

had an invigorating effect on the
audience, which always remained‘
alert and attentive to each word that
passed her pert lips.

“The audience tonight was very
sharp,” Parker said in an interview.
“It seemed that they caught every
little thing I|s‘a_id.'That’s very '

'.~.L.A -1-J'.‘.

Comedienne Parker Makes G

refreshing.”

. At one point in her routine, she
delivered a triple pun, which was
met by Snickers, chuckles, and -
moans. She laughed on stage at the
variety of reactions.

“I enjoy puns,” she said later on, A.

“I’ve always had a fascination with
them. Sometimes you won’t get a
big laugh, but you will get a
response.” -

Perhaps Nancy Parker’s forte is
her ability to do impressions of
many female entertainment artists.
Confessing that she does watch an
incredible amount of television, she
asked for actresses from the ‘30s

‘_ and ‘40s. Coupled with the impres-

sions of Greta Garbo, Marlene‘
Dietrich, Judy Garland, Shirley
Temple, and Bette Davis, she also
mocked quite convincingly the more
contemporary‘Julia Child, Gloria
Vanderbilt, and Goldie Hawn.

“I like to be creative and
original, so I don’t do political
jokes,” Parker said. This explains
her choice of Jonathan Winters as
her favorite comedian. Winters is ‘
known for his hilarious unique
characterizations and his very inven-
tive ad-libs. I

“My favorite comedienne would
have to be' Lily Tomlin, but I don’t
really consider her a comedienne.
She’s more an actress than anything;
else.’.’ Parker isalso an actress; she
recently signed a dealwith NBC for
her own television series. '

Referring to the relative number
of comediennes, as opposed to com-
edians, Parker says, “We’re increas-
ing in number. Women are begin-
ning to -believe that they can be fun.
ny, even when they_ are not by
themselves.” She also criticized pro-
grams like The Tonight Show for
not exposing high-quality women

Writer Ann Beatts of “Saturday Night Live."
~.‘I would have worn something else, but I couldn ’I get these pants off. ’

outrageous spike-heeled boots. She
apologized for the pants, explaining
“I would have worn something else,
but I"'couldn’t get these pants off.”
She read some passages to the
crowd from a book she helped write
and edit entitled Titters. It was a
book of humor written exclusively
by women. She was bright, witty,
even comfortable behind the lec-
turn. Someof the men, though,
were intimidated. Some of her '
biting comments -prodded their egos,

comics. “Some of the comedians on
that show simply are not funny,”
she said.

And Nancy Parker knows comedy
when she hears it.

The second half of the nightclub
featured Mildred Jackson, a
22-year-old Pitt student, whose
stunning rhythm and blues vocals
were exemplary. Backed by John

and chased their open-mindedness
out of the Student Union ballroom
ﬁve minutes before they left. She
. promised the women that they

would be “10 percent funnier” by
the time she finished the lecture.
It’s uncertain whether or not the
women have become funnier or
more comicalsince the experience, /
but it has become obvious that
many of them had more fun‘ than
some of the guys that began moving
closer and closer to the exit doors.

Williams (piano), Carl Carrington
(ﬂute), and Daryl Harris (sax), , {
Jackson’s powerful, dynamic voice
filtered through the nightclub at-
mosphere and soothed the once gai-
ly hysterical audience. Eyes focused
on the stage, the mood became very
relaxed, and after the fifty tminute
set (and a standing ovation), the
evening came to an end.

Bill Cosby Tantalizes All
Retains Refreshing Humor

Bill Cosby
Stanley Theatre I — _ \
March 24, 1980 a
By FORREST BUFFENMYER

Bill Cosby recently /turned 42. years old

and has been doing comedy for about 15 A

years. All this experience produced a show
on Sunday night that was unbelievably fun-
ny and atypical of the usual xﬁodern com-
edy performance. Not so, apparently, for
Cosby. -

Most of the material was fresh and new,

which was a relief. Unlike some comedians,

like the early Steve Martin, Cosby doesn’t
rely on the same old stuff. He has a wealth
of material to choose from, and his story-
telling approach to comedy is conversa-
tional—that is, he puts himself down in the
seats with the audience.

Cosby achieves his particular brand of
hilarity the way he’s always done it——using
voices and sound effects; using extreme ex-
aggeration and his strong belief that despite
all evidence to the contrary, he is always
right and everyone elseis always wrong.

His crowd _was not, what was ex-

pected—about 80 percent white, everyone
dressed as if at dinner, and‘ nearly all over-
thirty. This must be some measure of his
success: that he'is able to draw from those
who don’t normally go to “modern” com-
edy shows. It was as if Wayne Newton or
somebody else of the “older” crowd of
comedians/singers was appearing;

Cosby discussed his old.neighborhoo.din
some detail, as well as his relatives, dif-
ferent ways to die, the dentist, his children,
and others, before leading to his big
f1nish—parents. Since the audience was
composed of about 50 percent of these type

,of folks, it went over very well. Those of us

who aren't parents (yet) still found it funny,

though; and herein lies" some of Cosby’s

magic——he is able to poke fun at both sides
of an argument simultaneously, and make
each side laugh. '

Cosby received a standing ovation. If
there is any tribute to a comedian who rare-
ly does public appearances, who doesn’t
write much, and whose last several comedy
records have been met with limited success,
this was it. Yes, there was a living legend at
the Stanley Sunday night, and his name was
Bill Cosby.’ « A A

» On Mar. l2,>The Lion Walk Arts Center at 420 N. Craig Street saw the greatest (collection of new wave bands ever
assembled in Pittsburgh. All together, ten groups performed that night. The music started a little after  and continued
' until 3:30 a.m.

The prime organizer of the event was Joe Soap of the band Carsickness. He described its purpose quite simply.

“We ’just played here a few times, and The Lion Walk was real helpful. The Lion Walk has been real helpful to local
bands, unlike other local art centers,” he commented before the extravaganza’s start.

The concept behind the benefit was to take the $3 donations collected_at the door and pour it back into a future

event. One suggestion was a better sound system for future shows. The beneﬁt then helps both The Lion Walk and the local
‘ bands.

- ex, Kicking off the proceedings were the garage punks, The Bible. Though the group specialized in poor renditions of
standards like The Kinks’ “You Really Got Me” and Led Zeppelin’s “Whole Lotta,Love,” they still got-a good round of
' applause. The band’s reaction was very self-depreciating.

“If you’ll clap for that, you’ll clap for anything,” announced lead singer Barry .§gurn.

Next up was another small combo: Sex Communique. Sex Communique was formed as a spin-off of the short—lived
Young Radishe_s.‘They. are distinguished only by a female lead vocalist named Dawn who occasionally played guitar.

Sex Communique featured 70s punk material and a» few originals. Most notable was their rendition of the Buzzcock’s

. — “What Do I Get.”

The first of the major bands to go on stage was The Cardboards. Featuring sax and synthesizer over guitar, The
Cardboards practice their own brand of avant-garde roc_k.’ Alternately cool and abrasive, they very much have an acquired
. ' . -- - — taste.

After a half hour set, the band left the stage with a cheerful au revoir from lead vocalist Max Haste. The Card-

board’s large following wasn’t going toilet the band get away that easily, though. The audience demanded, and got, an en-
-- _ . core. The band obliged with “Copacabana Suite.”

Following The Cardboards was The Dark and almost no greater contrast between sets was provided that evening.
While The Cardboards played ina somewhat “arty” style, The Dark came close to heavy metal in content. .

During their set, The Dark played an edgy, clean set of originals. Guitarist Tom Moran and bassist Dave Doremus

traded off vocals throughout their songs. The group closed out with “Working Class Hero,” the high point of their set.
The least well-received group of the evening came next—The Compulsives.

A development o.f The Shut-Ins (Pittsburgh’s first new wave band), The Compulsives have gone through many

changes. At one time led‘ by L.A. refugee Johnny Angola, the band is now fronted by long-time scene activist Reid Paley.
The band has further been augmented by a synthesizer player who goes simply by the name of Lawrenet?

Musically reminiscent of the late lamented N.Y. Dolls, the band plays in a hard, fast style, that, while raw, isn’t slop-

py. Adding spice tothis attack were Paley’s pouting-antics as front man and Lawrence’s “treatments” on his homemade

_ p e . synthesizer, of the rest of the band’s sounds.

A number of spectators felt that The Compulsives had unfairly jumped in front of The Whereabouts. Some reacted

by throwing trash and “suggestions” to leave the stage. Though irritated, Paley and Co. continued to the end of their set,
. and despite the negative crowd reaction, managed to come across with a competent show.

' Following The Compulsives was a group of people new on the local scene—-—The Whereabouts.

Made up exclusively of Pitt students, The Whereabouts played, hard, energetic Ramones-style rock. They put on a

good show considering that the band has only been together five months. Also noteworthy is that they played all original
' ‘ material. Among the featured songs were “Killed My Landlord” and “Klandesdent.”
Of The Guy Pnumone Trio, the less said the better. Actually a fairly large aggregation, The Trio uses instruments

like an-upright acoustic bass and violin to make avant-garde “music.” Pre-programmed noise is more like it.

A more interesting band was No Shelter. Theirrepertoire ranged from almost popish new wave to hard punk

material. Led by extroverted front-man John Creighton, No Shelter was not the tightest band that evening, nor did they
» have the most interesting originals. But, they were enjoyable, and for a local band, that’s what counts.

One of the occasion’s last two bands was Young Lust. As one of Pittsburgh’s most active and original .“alternative”

V  ' t ’ ‘ ' , bands, Young Lust have made a quick reputation as a hot live age.
Sporting a mix of R&B, pop and new wave influences, Young Lust has no shortage of strong material. Though the

band has gone through quite a number of personnel changes, front-man, Bobby Porter is still the dominant personality.
Energetic really isn’t enough to describe this man; hyperactive comes close, though. Porter also seems to be on a one-man
crusade to bring soul back to rock. He might just succeed on his own, too!

 

 

 

Though coming on late (around'2 a.m.), Young Lust soon had most" of the remaining audience dancing. They finish-
ed off with a long version of Lou Reed’s “Sweet Jane.”
The final group was Carsickness, the organizers of the benefit. Usually featuring a line-up of guitar, organ, syn-
, thesizer, and drums, Carsickness, was‘ a three-piece for the benefit due to their synth-player Dave being in the hospital.
Guitarist Joe Soap first apologized for “the thin sound,” and the band proceeded to charge into their set. Car-
sickness was the most British-inﬂuenced band that played "(having British guitarist Soap doesn’t hurt). The hard, basic riffs
. adorned with the fast and furious keyboard work was an attractive strategy. -
The hard-core crowd of local enthusiasts remained to cheerthem on'until 3:30 in the morning. On stage, John
Creighton with soprano sax and Bobby Porter came out to give Carsickness a hand, in what was a rousing send-off for the
. , . _ night.
Surprisingly, there was very little violence at the event, except for one numbing incident. Reportedly, a man was all
but dancing on top of several girls. Another man stepped forward to defend his girl, and in the fracas that ensued had his
thumb biften off. Several people said they saw the incident but no positive proof was made of the offender when the pcirce
‘ _ . arrived. 1
On a more amusing note, several out-of-town musicians attempted to_take over the show. Led by ex—Dead Boy
Cheetah Chrome, they heard about the benefit and said they'were going to show up for an evening of jamming, by
themselves. T-hough warned, these people came anyway. One member of this group tried to go on stage. MC and security
force Bobby Porter quickly discouraged him from playing. The rest of Chrome’s entourage took the hint.
Over 200 people came to the Lion Walk forthe beneﬁt, making it the largest social event on the scene, ever. Despite
the one incident, there was very little trouble as people generally concentrated on having a good time in" what amouhted to
, ' ' . one big party.
In the future, one should hope any comparable events are equally successful.

“The music must change; ”’
The Who

And so it has. For the Iron City Houserockers, it means steadily improving a good idea: get back to the basics of rock
’n’ roll. There have been several changes for the Houserockers in the last six months, a period which could be marked by
the band’s appearance at Pitt September 7, 1979, for an outdoor concert on the Student Union Patio and last Wednesday’
concert in the Student Union Ballroom. In general, though, this is the period after last summer’s favorable reviews of the
Houserockers’ debut album, Love’s So Tough, and before the scheduled June 1 release of the band’s second album, Have
A Good Time But‘ Get Out Alive, on MCA. These six months represent approximately one—sixth of the Houserockers’
three-year career. It is perhaps the most crucial fraction of time in their history.‘

“The biggest overall change for. everyone is seriousness,” emphasized keyboardist Gil “The Count” Snyder during a
January interview. “I’m not" interested in turning into The Knack; where all of a sudden snap—and there you are. Usually
that dgesn’t'last too long. I’m satisfied to make ,a career of this thing and if it’s going to take a long time, so much the bet-
ter.” 4 ' V , ' . , 9

Personnel has changedtwice for the Houserockers. In July, guitarist Eddie Britt joined the established line-up of ‘Snyder,
lead vocalist, guitarist‘ Joe Grushecky, Marc Reisman on harmonica, Art Nardini on.bass, Ned Rankin behind the drums,
and guitarist Gary “Slim” Scalese. Britt was needed to help fill in guitar lines and harmonies which had developed when
the band was recording Love’s S0 Tough. Coming from a background of reggae, country, and space-rock bands, Britt was
initially used‘ only on selected songs which Grushecky and Scalese couldn’t perform in concert. By the September Pitt show,

, -however, he was a regular member of the band. A ’ ‘ _

During the fall it became apparent that a seven-man lineup was not the answer. Good reviews by Rolling Stone,
Billboard, Cashbox, and other trade magazines, as well as the local press, could not spur record sales, which had peaked by
the end of the summer. The Houserockers fell back on lean times.,Besides, three guitarists looked indulging in a band
which stressed going back to basics. '

The Houserockers neededlto tighten up what was already a good act; they did not need to “beef it up.” Throughout the.
fall, Britt established himself as the man to support Grushecky and lead the Houserockers’ guitar attack. In mid-December,
rumors of Scalese,-leavingxthe band, or being dropped at the request of ‘the Houserockers’ management, Cleveland Entertain-
ment, began to ﬂow like beer in the Decade on Saturday nights when the band was playing. a

At the end of the month, however, the rumors and beer talk came to an abrupt end. Scalese broke his right hand after
slipping on ice.7He quite the band with hopes of pursuing more of a blues-type music when his hand healed. .

??;.“It was a mutual parting,” says Gurshecky. Fortunately for the Houserockers, it was a smooth transition, one which
many people never seemed to notice. ‘ 4

The Houserockers’ attitude of seriousness, patience and willingness to change may be one of the best" investments the
band has right now. Another is talent. Together, these two elements help the band pursue its bran of gut-level, urbanblues
in the rock ’n’ roll tradition of Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, John Lee Hooker and the early RI iling Stones. Joe
Grushecky elaborated on the Houserockers’ music during a November interview: ~-

“I’m influenced by the old stuff and the Rolling Stones, my all-time favorite band. The record reviewers all hit on
Graham Parker, J. Geils, Springsteen and South Side Johnny (when Love’s So Tough was released). But we’ve been playing
this music before we even heard of any of those guys. I think why it does sound like them is because we’re actually coming ‘
from the same inﬂuences as they are. ‘ ’ . ’

“Like South Side Johnny, I met a couple of guys in that band and they’re really into oldies. I. think that they listen to '
the same type of stuff and -want to make the same type of music. But it’s not a nostalgia trip; we don’t want to be like Sha
Na Na. We listen to that old stuff because its still relevant to us. I don’t think anybody has ever touched those early guys as
far asgbasic raw, emotional rock ’n’ roll. It’s what made rock ’n’ roll in the first place.” ' 4

Since September, the Houserockers have rearranged most of the material from their first album. They have also added
many new songs to their concert repertoire. Tunes like “Pumping Iron,” “Don’t Let Them Push You Around,” and “The
Price of Love” have become almost as familiar to locals as “Hide Away” and “Turn It Up.” The new arrangements of
older material have become particularly noticeable sincethe band started recording again. Melodies like “Whole Lotta
Sriakin Going On,” which Houserockers have refined into a highly stylized encore number, are the most ‘noticeable.

The Houserockers began recording the new album in early February at Media Sound in New York. _The project is about
65 percent complete and the band will return to New York next week to finish. According to Grushecky, the album will---
contain“1l songs and “a lot of surprises. We have a couple arrangements for some of the songs. And some of the songs
have never been played here.”  A ” —

Although the Houserockers are on budget and far from calling all the shots, the musicians agree that they do have more
freedom in the studio this time. ' - I -

“The main idea,” says Grushecky, “is to let us develop on our own.” More support, both from management and from
other musicians, is also evident. Ian Hunter and Mick Ronson, who the Houserockers toured with this summer, have been -
voluntarily helping in the studio. It is a big change from the in-again, out-again weekend recording sessions the
Houserockers did in Cleveland for the first album. ' ' '

Touring over the past six months has changed little in way of the types of concerts theband performs. Primarily, it has
been out-of-town club dates in the tri—state area and, occasionally, warm-up gigs for other groups. This provides an oppor-
tunity for the band to present its material to audiences that are generally’ uninitiated to the Houserocker experience. The
crowds are often skeptical of “that band from Pittsburgh,” but the Houserockers know itis their job to win over a greater

, following. Any glamor associated with rock concerts takes a backseat to hard work at these shows. ‘ '
puring a November concertat St. Vincent College, with the Southern-based Henry-Paul Band as top-bill, the
H:-;xserockers worked damn’ hard. Opening with “I Can’t Take It Anymore,” the band often had to play against the jeers
and menacingly raised pints of Jack Daniels coming from the mostly Confederate-minded crowd. Someone was throwing
pennies at Grushecky. ‘ I _

“There’s too many cowboys out there,” the singer remarked back stage at the end of the set. Nevertheless, he and the
rest of the band returned for an encore that many people in the auditorium were calling for. The Houserockers knew that
somewhere out there more people were beingconverted. I *

There is also a humorous side to the Houserockers’ concerts. Grushecky relates one concert experience with a perfect
Pittsburgh punchline: “The ‘classic concert we played was with Black Oak Arkansas and Blackfoot. Black Oak Arkansas
was all dressed up in cowboy clothes. Blackfoot was all dressed up like Indians. It was like the cowboys, the Indians, and in
the mill_ hunkies. I couldn’t picture where these guys were coming from.” '

‘Shadow Box’ Spotlights Dath For Ins

The ‘Shadow Box
Directed By Donald Wadsworth
Pittsburgh) Playhouse Theater Company

By COLLEEN MCDONALD

Morris the cat may have nine lives, but

’ he, also, in the end, faced the final hour like
' ‘all the rest. Death is a subject that is left un-

A I touched. We dare not confront it until we

are forced’ to, as are three terminally ill pa-
tients in Michael Cristofer’s The Shadow
Box.

Now in its second week at the

A , Playhouse’s Craft Avenue Theater, under
’ the direction of Donald Wadsworth, The

Shadow. Box is a revealing two-act play
which brings the sordid realities of. death to
the surface. .

Cristofer came to his subject matter
when he learned that two close friends had
terminal illnesses; He uses the metaphor
of “shadowboxing with death” as an activi-
ty we engage in on a daily basis. “We are all
terminally alive,”. he said.

His three characters: Joe, Brian, and

Felicity are in the midst offighting death - 3

and in the process each learns that he/ she is
still very much alive. The set. is three cot-
tages on an experimental “hospital

(Raymond Laine), a blue-collar worker in

his rnid-forties who has his wife and teen--

age son ﬂown into town for his last days.
Brian (James O. Prescott), a failure "as

writer, poet, and philosopher, lives in cot- ‘

tage Number Two with his lover, Mark
(Don Craig), a former ‘ hustler. Also,
Brian’s ex-wife, Beverly (Kate Young), a
cattish whore with a vulgar sense of humor,
arrives unexpectedly on the scene.

In the third cottage, Number Three,
resides a spry old lady Felicity (Carol
DePaul). She’.s wheelchair-ridden, has a
heart implant, one lung, and a plastic bag
for a stomach. ~
_ Felicity, along,with her daughter, Agnes

(Jill Wadsworth) has been having a “piss-

poor” time but she’s the fighter among the

three “terminals.” DePaul, a Pittsburgh.

area actress, director and producer, does an
outstanding job of depicting her character,
Felicity.

Young also excelsas Beverly, rewarding
the audience with _a lively performance as
she drinks -herself across stage and re-
accounts her adventures as an international

w h o r e . _
The tone of the play IS not wholly
serious, ‘but _a Kleenex would have been

- helpful, especially toward the end of the

play, when the entire cast faces the audience
with the sincere message that says, “seize
the moment”——grasp life while we still. can.

Cristofer’s Pulitzer Prize and Tony
Award winning play has a lot to offer.
Death is at its liveliest in The Shadow Box.

‘A Small Circle’ of War, Politics and Love In 605

A Small Circle of Friends ‘
Directed by Robert Cohen

By DYLAN WILLIAMS

Don't let the title fool you; A Small Cir-
cle of Friends is really a triangle. Set in
Boston between 1967 and 1971, the film‘
follows the lives of three Harvard students,
Loe, Jessica, and Nick, from their
freshman through their senior years. These

V years, charged with the turbulence of war

and politics that pervaded the late 60s, form_
a colorful backdrop to what is essentially a
love story. As director Robert Cohen,
Mahogany, The Wiz,. a 1971 graduate of
harvard himself puts it, “We were drawn
into the politics of the time because we
couldn’t escape them. It was a generational
obligation. Our lives were being shaped by
forces we didn’t create or understand.” The
challenge" of these forces turns some to
drugs, some to a commitment of social
change, and some to a renunciation of
humanity. However, like most students of
that time, Leo, Jessica, and Nick want only
to survive the challenge and put their own
plans into action. ‘

Leo, played by Brad Davis Midnight Ex-
press, is a bright, hustling young journalist
with ambitions of becoming a writer for the
New York Times. For as passive the
character of Billy Hayes is in Midnight Ex-
press, Davis. does a’ very convincing _turn-
around with the aggressive, self-assured
character of Leo in this film. His perfor-
mance is memorable in that, for all his
radical ways, Leo’s lifestyle ‘remains the
least affected by the war, the riots, and the
politics. His appearance, unlike the others’,
does notvchange throughout the four years.

Jessica, an affluent girl from San Fran-
cisco who learns that growing up involves
painful choices, not just expecting what she
desires, is played by»Karen Allen (Animal
House, Cruising). Just as Leo expresses
himself through his writing, Jessica has her
art. She is open and frank, with a bluntness
about sex which is saved by the actress’ ap-
pealing smile and easy-going attitude. In-
deed, Miss Allen glides through all the
blunt language, a sexually anti—male skit,
karate classes for women, and a probable
“menage a‘trois” near the end of the film,
without creating a negative aspect in her
character. She is smooth, and her ex-

Actor-Director Caan Just a ’
‘Plain’ Dumb in Lead Role

Hide In Plain Sight

By STAN MOYER

The .film Hide’In Plain Sight, directed by,
and starring James Caan is based on a true
story. True stories are usually about as ‘bor-~
ing as can be and this film is no exception.
And you get the feeling that the people
behind the promotion of this film had the
same response because the advertisement is
just a bit misleading, suggesting more of a

conflict than actually is the case: “In June,

1967; the U.S. Department of Justice ab-
ducted this man’s children.” Well, not ex-
actly, abducted. . ’
Torn Hackland’s (James Caan) ex-wife ‘
Ruth (Barbara Rae) marries a government
informer and they are required to move,
along with Tom’s two children, under the
Federal Witness Relocation Program. The
main business of the film is Tom’s search
for his children because no onehas told him
what has happened. But there’s no energy
in the script and the characters shufﬂe
-through ' the film, like. zombies,» slowing. _

 V ,€_l0WI1 the__pac_e to a crawl. _ .

 

At first Tom is cool. He’s a simple,
patriotic man we are told—“I never pro-

. tested nothin’.” But he gets the run-around

from all law enforcement agencies, from
local to federal. After getting a lawyer the
prospects of ﬁnding his children get better,
but there is soon another thorn in Tom’s
side: he loses his job at the tire manufactur-
ing plant and the film takes the liberty of
revealing the inequalities of the state
{unemployment system. Then Tom goes to
Washington, D.C. to talk to his Con-
gressman, who couldn’t care less about his
problem. Oh, the injustice of the Federal
Government! _

_ This film could have been called
Hackland vs. Department of Justice, but it
doesn’t come close to the impact of Kramer
vs. Kramer because, in the latter, both op-
posing forces are loving, considerate
parents and the young child is a well
developed character. But in Hide In Plain
Sight, one opponent is an impersonal
‘bureaucracy, while the other is a character
(Tom) whose simplicity borders on the

idiotic, accompanied by only an inferred ‘
. . bond . between fathemrgand ’ children.

(Continued on page 71')’ "

changes with Leo form the most energetic
and entertaining parts in the film.
Jameson Parker, (The Bell Jar) who
plays Nick, completes the triangle. Whereas
Leo has the ﬂash, dazzle, and style, Nick
has the substance. He is the conservative,
all-American boy who can compromise and
therefore survive. His involvement in the
times is less creative than Leo’s or Jessica’s,
consisting of reading publicly the names of
students killed in Vietnam. Parker’s perfor-
mance, quiet and straightforward, supplies
the stability from which Davis’ character is
contrasted and therefore gains total
believability. .
Strong supporting performances are put
in by John Friedrich, who plays Leo’s
freshman roommate Haddox, an idealistic
Eagle Scout from the South who
transforms over the years into a radical bent

on destroying the system, and Shelley
Long,» who plays a liberated female
newspaper photographer. .

A Small Circle of Friends contains shades
of Animal House in its portrayal of college
dorm life, Love Story. in its sense of humor
which is always somewhat ironic, and The
Way We Were for that distant tone which
comes from setting the action over a period
of years, though the time span tends to take
awayfrom the depth of the relationships.

While many recent movies have dealt
with the devastating effect of war on the
fighting men, it is interesting to see a film
which spotlights the homefront struggle,
not of the radicals, but of the masses of
youngpeople who wanted only to perform
their generational obligations, then simply
live their own lives. '

UP GalleryFeatures Art of Rosea-nnRadosevich  

7

By MYRLE KAYE

Roseann Radosevich Prints
UP Gallery
March 5 to April 6

Roseann Radosevich brought her
lithographs and drawings home to Pitts-
burgh this month. “Roseann Radosevich

Prints” will be at the UP Gallery through
‘A’/Espril 6 and offers Radosevich’s interpreta-

tions of life, most particularly her inter-
pretations of life as a woman.

Female figures dominate the pieces in the
show. The drawings lean toward being exer-
cises of reproduction, tending to concen-
trate on accurate portraiture. They possess
a precious quality. “New Bedford Memen-
to” is just that, a silverpoint rendering of a
girl to aid the memory. Twoof the large
drawings, “Lady Luck” and “A Grand
Lady,” are technically impressive, but im-
complete. “Lady Luck” reads as unfinish-
ed, construction lines and indications of in-
tended work detract from the mysterious
figure of the woman. . ‘

Radosevich’s lithographs are the meat of
the show, and they’re delicious. The women
in the prints achieve an unsettling univer-
sality. Radosevich creates richly vivid _
moods and emotions with her treatment of

. the figure, the figure’s environment, and

color.

“Rose of Memory, Rose of -Forget-
fulness” is the ﬂashiest print in the show.
The bright yellow rose exudes strength and
becomes as heavy with life as the women in
the print. The mood of the piece is lighter
than most of her lithographs and is cap-
tured best in the ﬂoppy angle of a woman’s
hat.

“Vespers,” “After the Storm,” and
“Turn Away My Lady” create much
darker moods. Radosevich utilizes stark

rooms, solitary figures‘, and deep har-
monious colors to push her prints into the
realms of loneliness, sorrow, and pain.

— The two strongest prints of the show are
two of the darkest. Radosevich avoids color
and relies on the simple strength of black
and white. Her finecraftsmanship and odd,

out-of-sync viewpoint in “Light throisiagh
the Window” gives the print a real power.
“The Drifter” shares that same power as
Radosevich uses a rocking chair, a pattern-
ed carpet, and a woman in a plaid shirt to
conjure a dramatic, ominous moment.
The greatest strength of Radosevich’s

show is the unity it achieves. She is able to '

consistently portray an existence of confu-
sion, struggle, and reality with a reﬁned,
delicate touch. Her artwork is beautiful.
' Her message is rawly human. She weaves
beauty and pain into a phenomenon unto
itself.

of support and ideas. It was
_ through him I applied to the Tyler
School of Art in Philadelphia. No
one said I could get in.“

The Tyler School accepted
Radosevich on the strength of her
portfolio and in her second year she
received an assistantship. She
graduated from and went on to join
the faculty of Southeastern Massa-
chusetts University, a small liberal
arts and sciences college near Cape
Cod. She has taught for seven
years as the only woman in the
department and works actively with
the board of trustees to improve the

status of women at the school_.
Each print in Radosevich’s show
represents at least one female
figure. ‘‘I work primarily with the
figure because I think it’s something
everyone can relate to. I like to
make"pictures that tell a story,
things that are more narrative. I do
a lot of work‘ ‘with the formal
aspects of the pieces, but the feeling
comes from inside. I work with
females because I work basically
from my experience, so in a sense
they are self-portraits. I want my
work to stand and I hope it says
something to men. If it reaches
women, that’s good. I’m glad. It’s

FiberArt Unfolds Rhythm

B.J. Adams Fiber Show
Artists At Work Gallery
March 1-March 31

If the purpose of‘ the Artists At Work

Gallery is to deliver what is contemporary

and new in art, they have succeeded with
B.J. Adams’ fiber show’,-Cadence. ,
A nationally known artist from
Washington, D.C., Adams’ work has ap-
~ peared world-wide from the Renwick
Museum Wearable Show in Washington to
the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural
History to.tl;e Textile Exhibition of 1977 in
England.  ' * ’ 
The Cadence collection represents a
departure from her other work. They are
kindred to
reliefs.  , _ —
The works are executed in fabrics of
heavy corduroy and velveteen to allow the
nap of the material catch and reflect light,
producing rich shadows and generating rich
textures.‘ Each piece is a singular color:
dark browns, beiges, and ultramarine blues.
Layered forms and shapes repeat one on
top of the other with the precision of

symmetrical patterns or forms that twist
and flow into sprawling lines...

The Cadence collection can be broken
down into two categories—the pieces that
stand on--their own as separate forms and
thepieces clustered into a unit.

Cadences One through Five grow and ex-
ist as separate entities. The layered forms of
cloth come together to create their own
edges. The lines flow into different direc-
tions and execute a sense of movement.

C,ad_ence. -Ten, comprised’ of 10* separate
pieces placed together as one unit, consists
of ‘anchored rectangle or squares. This,
neutral beige collage eminates from the base
of the square or rectangle. The pieces do
not stand out‘ or come to life as energetic
forms. The base holds down the flowing
‘direction of the lines and interrupts the
rhythm of the cadence. They become static
and motionless.. Cadence Ten loses the
rhythm and, dynamism of the larger works
that exist as forms by themselves.

The Cadence collection can be viewed
through March 31, at The Artists At Work
Gallery, 1500 Penn Ave., in the Strip
District, on Fri., Sat., and Sun. from 10:00
to 5:00, Mon. and Thurs. from noon.until
9:00. _ It’s a refreshing look at non-

\

tough out there.

“I think the full ﬁgures are eas-
ing out of my work. More prints
with parts of figures are happening,
-prints like"‘Waiting Room II.” I
think I’m moving more toward at-
mosphere and less hard lines. More
atmosphere for more mystery and
to imply a sense of what's happen-
ing,” she explained.

“I think I got my talent and ap-
preciation of art from my mother.

I went to the art classes offered at
Carnegie through high school. That
was important. They-were '
equivalent to a strong freshman
program.

“I really love Pitt. I loved going
to school here,” she said. “I went
to school with a very warm bunch
of people, a very committed group
of people. It was during the war
and everyone really believed in op-
posing our involvement in Vietnam.
Those years are unforgettable.” .

Who is Roseann“Radosevich?

She’s the daughter of Rudy
Radosevich, a man who worked at
J&L Steel for 35 years. She attend-
ed Pitt and has been making a 1iv- "
ing as an artist for seven years.
Stop in to see her prints at the
gallery on Forbes Ave. It’s nice to

have her back in town.

It is said that the Irish can make a song
out of any event or- happening in life. ‘Tis
“ true! Last Friday, the Clancy Brothers, the
well-known traditional Irish quartet, paid
Pittsburgh a “lovely” compliment to St.
Paddy’s Day, as they weaved a tapestry of
Irish life from their songs. "““
The three brothers; Paddy, Tom and
Bobbie Clancy and their nephew, Robbie
~-0’C'o'nnell, bounded on the Stanley Theater
stage dressed in Aran knit fisherrnen’s
sweaters and black pants, a mere 20 minutes
late. ‘‘ . .
The Irish may have no sense of time_,‘but
they make up foriit with their rhythm...and
- songs...and, stories.» The show was ceili
(kay-lee) style, an evening of traditional
Irish music,_song, dance and poetry. ’

rebel songs, some love songs, some sad

songs and we’ve got some-dirty songs that

we’ve cleaned up a bit and some c-lean songs
we’ve dirtied up a. bit.” ' A

' with lilting brogues and fanciful charm

were well-received. The crowd was typically

The quartet moved smoothly from one
song to another, stopping only for a joke or
a poem in between. Bobbie, Clancy, an ac-
complished musician, wandered. from ban-
jo to guitar to bodhram (goat skin drum).to
harmonica, while young Robbie‘O’Connell
stuck with the guitar.

The .Cl‘a‘iicys were not without a bevy of
lamenting ballads either. The audience

drew to a motionless silence as “The Green '

Fields of France,” a song about the death
of ‘a young soldier named Willie McBride,
was softly‘ sung. And “Come by the Hills”
sent a tear down the checks of many older
folkwho were born on the precious Irish

song.”

‘Backspace’ Frontrunner in Student Literature, Art

Backspace
Volume Six, Winter 1980

By ALISON MATIKA

Inside the soft, shining pages of
this little book you can find prints,
‘drawings, photography, poetry and
prose created by young, fresh artists
aiming their varied talents directly at
your imagination.. Backspace is a

7 .- very good creative publication, giving
a palatable taste of various techni-
V ques of artistry. The magazine is
created BY STUDENTS attending
(are you ready?) the University of
Pittsburgh. The university is men-
tioned- only to acknowledge the
amazing fact that, despite the
creative support the administration
‘generally and greatly lacks, people
are creating; writers are writing and
artists are drawing and printing. The
collection of writing in Volume Six of
Backspace is equally divided among
- -poetry, short prose and some very in-
teresting visual artwork. The artistic
arrangement and design of the art-
work, poetry and prose produce a
book organized to elicit the full effect
intended by its contributors.

Thepoetry of the magazine gives

 T . r v you ten poets. Perhaps seven poets

and three people who write poetry.
The reader is not deceived, taking

notice that some have tried harder ,

than others. Those poets who have
succeeded in stirring their readers are
Scott Howard Mann, Ralph Karsh,
»R.K., Beth Bateman—Newborg and

’ Greg Weller, to name a few; their
poems leave imprints on minds or
sharp, crisp sounds on lips or soft
melodies somewhere in between. The

poets are all very different; there is
something for everyone.

Taking into account aesthetic
differences, even if the idea, emo-
tion, situation or experience are
unappealing, there are poems in this
book undeniably effective. There ex-
ists in this volume of Backspace
perfected use of the English
language. Reading some of these

poems creates a beautiful artistic ex-
perience——leading one to read aloud.
Whether they create a delicate
distinction between abstraction and
the concrete or a restless, rhythmic
beat, these poems transform the
usual into the unusual.

The narrative points of view are
fun, interesting and intriguing; one is
compelled to read on.

A Probi

The Falcon and the Snowman‘
By Robert Lindsey
Simon and Shuster

TRW Corporation in California leaked.
It. seeped secret, valuable documents so
essential to national defense that it seems
incredible to believe that security for the

massive TRW aerospace plant had holes in’

it.

But there were holes, and even more in-
credible, the holes were found by a disillu-
sioned college dropout and a dope pusher.

Christopher John Boyce and Andrew
Daulton Lee, respectively, were those per-
sons who just five years ago found the-holes
in the California CIA communications
operation and began pushing out through
those gaps classified surveillance satellite
plans, leaking vital information to the
Soviets.

This is Lindsey’s first book. As a staff
writer -for “The New York Times” Los
Angeles bureau, he began covering the es-
pionage trials of Boyce and Lee in 1977.
From those court assignments, Lindsey

, begana careful tracing of the events that

ng Through CIA In
‘Falcon And Snowman’

led to the selling of plans for several key
U.S. surveillance satellites and other CIA
operations to the Soviets.

Though “The Falcon and The
Snowman” (a reference to Boyce’s love of
falconry and Lee’s dabbling in the cocaine

- trade) is Lindsey’s first hardbound product,

it is excellent. All the key components for
this fascinating story are there: a look into
the social environment of the early Seven-
ties that turned Boyce, a model Catholic,
into a disgusted youth who struck back by
using his job, TRW communications
relayer for the CIA, to leak documents to
Lee. The book also looks at Lee’s venture
into the drug world, an attempt to compen-
sate, probably, for his small stature that he
believed led people to brush him off as in-
consequential, a belief that eventually made
him mad for money, power, and notoriety
and to obtaining those by selling documents
to Soviets at the Mexican embassy.

It is difficult to read “The Falcon and the
Snowman” without feeling sympathy for
Boyce and Lee. The “screw someone else
before they screw you” mentality of most
of the last decade probably rubbed off a bit
on all of us. ‘ “The Falcon and the
Snowman” shows what happened to two of
those who put that ideology into practice.

haven’t changed much, the quality
of the Houserockers’ presentation
has changed remarkably. The band’
consistently improves its dynamic,
have-a-good-time stage persona.
The Houserockers almost never fail
at being an intense band and a fun
band. Once back in town, especially
at the Decade, Grushecky often uses
the band’s less memorable ex-
periences_ on the road as a narrative
during “I’m Lucky (1 Can Still

~ Rock ’n’ Roll).” ‘And the

hometown intensity of a Saturday
night crowd at the club where the
Houserockers got their start always
seems to add the words “In Pitts-
burgh” to the song.

It is difficult at this point to say
how successful Have A Good Time
But Get Out Alive will be for the
Houserockers. Undoubtedly, the
most crucial factor now will be the
number of people that catch on to

the band’s sound. For regardless of
how, important studio time,
managers, and promoters are to a
rock ’n’ roll band, in the end, it is
always the people who buy the
records and attend the concerts that
determines success. ‘

Yet the Houserockers themselves
have made the» most important con-
tribution‘ to their ultimate success.
Each member has worked hard and
contributed in his own way to the
effort. Each member continues to
do so with a quiet, but solid, sense
of determination. There is no turn-
ing back fdr the Iron City
Houserockers. They are in no rush
to get to the shining light of success
at the end of a tunnel. Perhaps
that’s because they’ve already had a
satisfactory glimpse of it.

Wednesday night, after following
the Houserockers since the
September concert, I heard “Hide

, Away” while‘driving_ on East Car-
. son Street inthe South Side. The

—In “White Wine and Jazz,”
Mark Collins defies and plays with
his readers; it proves an interesting
relationship.

—Richard S. Brodsky gives the
reader revealing dialogue with
descriptive images in a short story en-
titled “Uncle Pasya.” The image at
the topuof the stairs where the nar-
rator remembers his uncle is un-
forgetable.

The prose of Backspace provides
some pure moments and, like the

poetry, is worth reading. The reader .

is rewarded for the effort. The pieces
are short but, nonetheless, succeed in
cultivating attitudes in their readers.

It has been said that writers ought
to be influenced by as many great
writers as possible but be decent and
acknowledge the debt-or try and hide
it.

—Karen Metzinger appropriately
entitles the first section of her piece
“Benjamin.” The style reminds one
of William Faulkner’s Benji. She is
successful in her stylistic imitation
here and uses words well. Belief is
suspended, leaving ones imagination
open to the mood she creates.

—Michael Kane recreates the
“beat” generation, adapting the style
of Jack Kerouac to his piece called,

« “In the Gutter.” The style is a con-

tinuous ﬂow of ideas, sensations,
situations and events that seem as if
they could go on and on.

Kane's piece appears at the end of
the book, combining two wishes: the
specific desire to know where the

piece is going and the general wish ~

that the pages of the book would
continue. Backspace will talk to you.
Buy it and give it to someone you
love.

Metheny Group Performs Packed Evening of Jazz 

By CHRIS RASMUSSEN A

The Pat Metheny Group
Duquesne University
March 22, 1980

Three years ago, Pat Metheny and three
other, musicians presented their first con-
cert. The place: Pittsburgh,

Last Saturday evening, the Pat Metheny
Group returned. The night was 'a
memorable one:
dinary and the {facilities were horrendous.

Picture this. After locating the Peter
Mills Auditorium, you find‘ that the

' gymnasium-sized hall is packed, beyond

credibility ‘(and beyond the mandated oc-
cupational limit), with at least 1000 of the
2000 people seated on the hardwood ﬂoor.

Luckily, after the opening song,
“Heartland,"’ you didn’t seem to mind the
discomfiture anymore.

Metheny’s guitar work was fabulous,
drifting comfortably and confidently from
the mellow, soft_ jazz that he has become a

. -leading stylist in, to the driving complicated

rhythms which are associated with much of
the popularcontemporary jazz. He plays
with ineffable. force, his audience wrapped
in ‘his music like a.blanket.

D_irectly following “Airstream.” which

SHDWCASE on

, Albums

the music was extraor- _

featured the laid-back, soothing bass of
Mark Egan, the group launched into “April
Joy,” one of their older tunes, and then in-
to “Unity Village.” also performed were
two songs, as, yet unrecorded, the first
focusing-on a large-scale guitar solo which
swirled throughout the auditorium,
engrossing all in its rhythmic complexity

and masterful delivery, and ‘an extensive,

ﬂuid, keyboard solo by Lyle Mays. The se-
cond song began with the synthesized sound
of a helicopter bleeding into a quick-paced
tape loop which formed the base for an
abstract, almost surreal composition,

highlighting more of Mays’ work (chieﬂy _

on the synthesizer) and the intricate, equal-
ly impressive percussion work of Dan Got-
tlieb. '

The last song of the ninety-minute set
was “The Epic,” which, after its final
chord, sent the audience to their feet cheer- ,
ing. Everyone remained standing for the
encore—the intense, riveting title track
from their “American Garage” album. It
was a most satisfying end to a night of in-
comparable jazz. ’=

The next time the Pat Metheny Group
comes to perform, Pit_tsburgh\will be there,
waiting in the wings of the Stanley Theatre.
Or so it hopes.

Thelrony and
the Ecstasy

MAD LOVE
Linda Ronstadt
Asylum
Since the release of Heart Like A
Wheel in 1974, Linda Ronstadt has
been the queen of American pop
music. With the release of her
latest album, Mad Love, she is sure
to say there in the 1980s, for this is
her finest, most cohesive album
since Heart Like A Wheel.
_ Whereas Heart Like A Wheel was
basically a country album, ﬁlled
with forlorn ballads about faithless

love, her new album is basically new
wave, and Ronstadt’s singing is
tougher and more powerful than it
ever has been. l

The title song_.- written by Mark
Goldenberg, (who is a member of

‘ the Los Angeles based new wave

band, The Cretones) kicks off the
theme of the album—mad love, be
it defiant, angry or crazy. The
tough stance Ronstadt takes never
subsides, as she pushes her way
through such songs as “How Do I .‘
Make You,” “Cost of Love”
(another Goldenberg tune) and .
“Talking In the Dark,” written by
Elvis Costello. There is no trace of
self-pity in any of the songs nor any
of the country ballads that-Ron-
stadt always slipped into her past
albums. Instead there is an ironic

‘Hidein Plain Sight’ Bores

A (Continued from Page 8)

All the information is ‘given out to the au-
dience. We know where the kids are, that
they’re safe and why they were moved. This
restricts the direction of the film to one of a
character study of a father who has lost his
children. Fine. But-Caan’s attempt seems
feeble, half-baked at best. He goes through
theﬁlm shaking his head and sighing, sup-
posedly holding in hisrage-for the end of
the film. And if ‘one boring character
deserves another, Alisa (J ill Eikenberry), an
elementary schoolteacher, fills the bill

perfectly. It almost seems inevitable that.

Tom would meet such a person; after deal-

- ring with grade-school children all day it ,

probablyseems like a‘ break for Alisa to be

with the simple‘-minded Tom. Their scenes ,

together could be called “Barbie Meets

, Industrial-Strength Ken.” ,
This whole project is ridiculous from"

script to characterization. In one scene
where the characters are supposed to be
maﬁa the set is so cheap and the dialogue so
contrived that the whole affair looks like a
reject from" The Godfather. Let’s face it,
after Coppola's masterpiece you just can’t
put Italian-looking people in expensive
suits, have them eating lots of pasta and
sauce, and have everybody in the room kiss-
ing some old man’s hand to evoke mafia.
The effect is parody and the joke is on the
makers of this film.

This film is Caan’s directorial debut and
there is some good visual composition but
the film as a whole severely lacks any

redeeming qualities. With Can also in the '

lead role,‘ he just might have hit off more

than he could chew. And the first bite, the .

script,’ he should have spit out. It’s been
said that the truth is hard to swallow. Well,

. so is this film.

twist to her voice, as if she knows
it’s all just a game.

Ronstadt ﬂirted with Costello
in her last album with “Alison,”
_but this time she takes the plunge
with three Costello songs, and it is
this commitment which makes the
album so interesting. There is no

~ \ splattering of styles here, Ronstadt

sticks to a cohesive theme which
says, “don’t mess around with;

me.” Her vulnerability is ironic
rather than forlorn and this suits '
Costello’s songs just fine.

Ronstadt’s band, which features
Goldenberg on guitars, andsuch' old
favorites as Russ Kunkel (drums),
Waddy Watchel (guitar) and Dan
Dugmore (bass), seems hotteriand
more inspired than ever. The past
complacency of both Ronstadt’s

. singing and her band seems to have
given way now to a less studied,
more passionate sound. Perennial_
producer Peter Asher. «has done
a wonderful job in presenting a very
different facet of Ronstadt.

Linda Ronstadt has come a long
way since Heart Like A Wheel and
this album is a big step forward for

- her, but the two albums are similar
in their cohesive.view and style.
Whereas Heart Like A Wheel was
about a poor pitiful Linda, Mad
Love is about a tough, jaded Ron-
stadt. "

Don’t expect punk.

Cockburn’s

Dancing in 'I”he_Dragon’s Jaws
Iiruce Cockbum '
Millennium

Over the past few years, Bruce
Coclcburn has made a name for
himself with his jazz-tinged folk
music. More of a folkie, than an
anemic singer-song writer,
Cockburn has made a good name
for himself .in Canada, and a slight
impression in the U.S. '

Dancin’ Dragon

"" ‘ Dancing In the‘ 'ragon,_’s Jaws is? '

Cockburn’s fourth album, and it
stays to the style he has set before,
folk with faint jazz overtones. ‘
Cockburn isn’t out to run down, he

.keeps his arrangements restrained
and his voice controlled.

Where he does make an impres-
sion, if you listen a few times, is in
his lyrics. In his own airy way,
Cockburn’s'words are very intcnsed
and focused. Striking images ,
abound; for example, “Wondering
Where The Lions Are” features the
lines: Huge ‘orange _flying boat rises
off a lake/ thousand-year-old ‘
petroglyphs doing a double take.”
In the song “Incandescent Blue”,
the “concrete vortex sucks down
the wind/ it’s howling like a
violin.” ' .

Cockburn’s wordsare anything
but banal, and the melodies and
vocals match the lyrical thought.

Robert Gordon possesses a voice  1 ‘

that strikes more than hazy images
of Elvis Presley and his backup ‘

releases, because it blends the best
- moments of them (l976’s self-titled .

Warren Zevon, 1978's Excitable
Boy) into a smooth cohesive unit
that functions nicely.

There aren’t any weak moments

~ here. A general feeling of mystery
and intrigue, crazed violence and

’ heartache make up the record, with
songs ranging from the title track
“Bad luck streak in dancing
school/I’m down on my knees in
pain” to the sheer energy of the
track “Wild Age,” which combines
the Eagles’ “Sad Cafe” with an
earlier Zevon track, f‘Desperadoes
Under the Eaves,” but with the in- _
tensity of “Lawyers, Guns, ‘and
Money.” There are ballads, like

' “Bed of Coals” and “Empty-
Handed Heart,” both done with
Linda Ronstadt. In short, another
masterpiece by Zevon, featuring '
some of the best musicians Southern
California has to offer. ' .

If you, to'o, have been anxiously
waiting for two years, then you’ve_
got a real treat in store for you.
After a dry period in rock in recent _
