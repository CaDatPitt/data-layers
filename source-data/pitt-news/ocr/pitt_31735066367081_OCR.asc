The State Legislatures’ inactivity on the University’s state-related-
ness has prompted Student Government (SG) and Th'e Pitt News to co-

sponsor a rally Friday at noon in the Quadrangle.

“The purpose of the rally is to intensify University awareness that
there is agrave possibility Pitt will ‘not be made a state-related university
before the end of this fiscal year, which is June 30,” emphasized Fred N,
Frank, editor of The Pitt News. “If the Pitt\ bill is not passed in the first
three days of the Legislatures’ next session, the delay could last until as

late as September,” Frank added.

Frank and SG President Ralph Manning are co-chairing the rally,
which will give key participants an opportunity to explain the delay in the
Pitt bill.‘ In addition, prominent state-wide figures who have had access to

the particulars of the situation, will be invited to speak.

A TELEGRAMS HAVE BEEN issued to the following people’: Governor
William W. Scranton; Lieutenant Governor Raymond P." Shafer, Republican
candidate for governor; Milton J. Shapp, Democratic gubernatorial candi-
date; Rep. Martin P. Mullen, chairman of the House Appropriations Com-
mittee; Sen. Robert D. Fleming, chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee; Rep. Joshua Eilbert, House Majority leader; Rep. K. Leroy
Irvis, Majority Caucus chairman; Senator Leonard C. Staisey, Democratic
candidate ‘for lieutenant governor; Rep. Harry Markowitz, Republican
legislator; Senator John H. Devlin, Senate Minority leader; and Sen.

Albert Pechan, Senate Majority leader.

Speaking on the need for University support for the rally, Frank
commented, “The entire University community must attend the rally to
show the legislators our united support for immediate passage of the Pitt U  __
legislation. While nearly all the major legislators have expressed support , ‘ "  ’ ‘
of the bill, it still remains unsettled. This delay is causing much hardship
to many parents and students and is slowing up nearly all University oper-

. Manning echoed Frank’s remarks, saying that “It is the duty of SG
and The Pitt News to take the leadership in this situation, since both
organizations are responsible to every University student.” I
. ‘‘IN ADDITION TO the rally, SG is circulating a petition on state-_
relatedness throughout the general community and is instituting a letter-
writing program-in line with The Pitt News’ campaign,” Manning said.
“We are also planning a SG meeting this weekend to pass a resolution on‘
_ this issue,” he stated. ’
Manning’s and Franks’ move "came after a series of events which A
resulted in a stalemate between the Pennsylvania Senate and the House "
of Representatives. Gov. Scranton had agreed last week to sign legislation ‘
reducing the.University’s tuition to $450 per year for all full-time students. '
However, the Republican majority leaders in the Senate refused to pass
the University’s bill until the general appropriations bill is passed, claiming , _
that by their interpretation of the State Constitution all preferred legis-.- 4
lation (-i.e. general appropriations) must be settled before non-preferred_ - -I
legislation such as the University’s bill can be decided. '

A National Foreign Policy

P "Conference ‘in Washington

might be the last place one
would expect to find Uni-
versity’ administrators and
instructors. Nevertheless,

, eight of these educators, led by

Dr. David H. Kurtzman, acting

. chancellor, attended such a con».
 ference and were impressed with
 the “-international responsibility”

of American education.
The discussion of this responsi-

bility was presented by Charles- I

‘Frankel, assistant secretary of
state for cultural and education-
al affairs. Dean Rush said that
Frankel “spoke to the educators
as an educator.” _

“Today, we (the U.S.) have op-
tions with. regard to the way in
which we ought to deﬁne our re-
sponsibilities in the rest of the
.world,” commented Frankel. “But

'we do not have any option with

regard: to the question whether

I we have world responsibilities.

If we choose to use our power as
a ‘nation, we make a-choice that
deeply affects our fellows on this
planet. If we choose not to use

our power, this choice‘ also af-

fects our fellows.”

The U.S. can educate or misad-
ucatet for world responsibility,

. according to the Assistant Sec-

retary of State. He also welcomed
‘the Conference as a chance to in-
crease communication and thus
increase the strength :and the‘ in-
tegrity of’ both American educa-
I tion and foreign policy.

The Conference, remarked Dean
of Student Affairs Helen Rush,
“strengthened my conﬁdence in
the quality of men who are _di-'

' ,- recting our foreign affairs.”

Legislator Tells
Facts of State Bill

(The following is a statement
sent to Howard Ainisman and
Fred Frank in response to their
telegram.)

Thank you for your telegram
expressing concern over legisla-
tive delays on appropriations in-
volving the University of Pitts-
burgh. I hope a similar message
was sent to leaders’of the State
Senate.

Through officials of the Uni-
versity, with whom we House
Democrats have been working
very closely, you must know we
share your concern over both
the delays in appropriating funds
and in concern for Pennsylvania
students generally. The facts are
that the enabling bill and the ap-
propriations bill making the Uni-
.versity State-related and allowing
tuition reductions to $450 a year
for Pennsylvania residents orig-
inated in the House and was
passed by us some time ago. No
action, however, was taken by
the Senate until today, when I
understand that house ﬁnally de-
cided to move.

I hope any communication you
may have sent to the Senate to-
gether with the constant efforts
that House Democrats have tried
to exert in your behalf have
helped its members make up their
minds. That the Administration’s
position on this matter has been
untenable is illustrated by my
own public statement, a copy of
which I am enclosing.

Joshua Eilberg

In many ways, the status of
the University of Pittsburgh is
similar to that which existed last
year involving Temple and Penn-
sylvania State Universities. I call
to your attention the following
facts:

In response to repeated re-

' quests by myself, Representative

James J. A._ Gallagher, chairman
of the House Committee on High-
er Education, and other House
Democrats,“ the Governor called
a special session to consider legis-
lation on the University of Pitts-
burgh. This House has acted on
that special call. We have passed
two bills, one cna3_:l.ing the Uni-.
versity of Pittsburgh to become a
state-related institution and one
making an appropriation that
would allow a reduction in tui-
tion costs to Pennsylvania resi-
dents to $450 a year. Both bills
were sent to the Senate for ac?-
tion which has not, to date, been
forthcoming.

The Senate passed and sent to

' us only an enabling bill. We are

adamant in our intention that
the University ‘of’Pittsburgh and
its students be granted the same
status and advantages as were
granted to both Temple and

' Penn State.

We have received several legal
opinions, including one from a

, highly respected ,long-term \at-

torney for the Legislative Refer-
ence Bureau. Such opinions con-
tend there is no legal basis for
the Administration’s contention
that non-preferred appropriations
bills must not be enacted before
general appropriations bills. This
matter, '£h9_ °Dinions state, is one
that is left to the discretion of
the General Assembly. Accord-

"ing to a least one opinion, Tem-

ple University, for example, now
is a State-related institution, so
appropriations to it no longer fall

.into the category of non-prefer.
ﬁred appropriations.

‘We have often repeated that

7 students in Western Pennsylvania,_

as well as those in other parts of
the State, must be given the same

Letters to the Editor

provisions to apply to full—time
as well as part-time students. In
this regard, we also point out
that the Senate continues to drag
its heels on bills that would, in
eifect, reduce tuition costs to
Temple and Penn State students
attending those universities on a
part-time basis.

Aside from these opinions,
however, it is interesting to note
that this House passed unani-
mously a number of non-prefer-
red appropriations bills before
any general appropriations were
enacted. Unanimously includes
members of both sides. Can we
infer that even our Republican
colleagues have doubts about the
constitutionality of the Adminis-
tration’s position? A

Despite these legal opinions,
there is ample evidence that even
if the legality of the issue were
truly at stake, this Administra-
tion is using this issue and the
students of the Commonwealth
as political footballs. For exam-
ple, recent appropriations bills
were passed by both Houses and
signed by the Governor that
were clearly in the non-prefer-
red appropriations category.
Among these were bills involv-
ing the Moore College of Art, in
Philadelphia, and the off-campus
center of Penn State at the site
of the Olmstead Air Force Base.

Like many other things this
Administration has tried to stir
up, the bills involving the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh are being
used to cloud the real issue and
to stall for political advantages.
Our position last year and our
position today remain the same:
we will have three great univer-
sities in Pennsylvania as state
related institutions at which
Pennsylvania students can be
educated at the same minimal
cost. ’

Director Clarifies

dents from the Pittsburgh area
urging us to act on the bill’ cut-

of Pittsburgh.

As you know, this bill passed
the House of Representatives
April 20, 1966, by a vote of 195-5,
and was referred to the Senate
Appropriations Committee April
21, 1966, and this is where it lies
at the present time. Many of
these telegrams are accusing the
Chairman, Mr. Mullen, of being
the bottleneck.

I would certainly appreciate it
if you would notify the student
body that this is not the case.
The Chairman of the Appropria-
tions Committee and the Com-
mittee have never opposed a tui-
tion reduction for the University

of Pittsburgh. ‘

Five Fields,
TennisCourts
Constructed

By MIKE BROURMAN
While the rest of the Uni-
versity is hung up financial-
ly by the political antics of
the State Legislature, the Ath-

letic Department continues its,

rapid and expensive expansion.

The newest addition to the
athletic plant will be a complex
of athletic ﬁelds, presently under
construction directly behind Trees
Gymnasium, costing $1,800,000.

If this seems like a large
amount of money to spend on a
complex consisting of a football
practice ﬁeld, a combination

,3 baseball and soccer ﬁeld, three

9 dirt intramural ﬁelds, and sev-
en tennis courts, the principals
concerned are sure that it will
be repaid by a great impI‘0Ve*
ment in the sports program.

The University has not had its
own athletic ﬁelds since 1946,
and Director of Athletics Frank
Carver is sure that the new com-
plex will return the athletic pro-
gram to its pre-World War II
glory. '

Soccer coach Leo Bemis set the
general tone, saying that the new

4% ﬁelds will improve the soccer
 'team “conservatively, by at least
ten per cent.”

For the past few years the soc-
cer players have been forced to
practice at Kennard Field, a dirt

, ﬁeld owned by the city. This has

created. many problems, accord?

ing ‘to Bemis.

“On a dirt ﬁeld you can't pick
up the good skills. necessary in
soccer,” Bemis said. “You need
grass to pick up the ball control
type ofgame necessary in good

‘ soccer.”

There is also a great morale
boost in not having to use Ken-
nard, said Bemis. “Morale wise,
it is~not ‘a good place to work
out. There are no._facilities for
watering, _and in dry\weather the
dirt is just so much dust. Then

(

 

'4,» /

[T MIGHT look like one big patch of dirt, but by
next Fall this area behind Trees Hall is expected

 Athletic Growth Is Aided by Complex

to contain a football practice ﬁeld, a combination

mud.”

Another problem the new com-
plex will help solve is recruiting.
“Now whenla boy comes in from
out of town,” Bemis said, “I
don’t show «him our practice ﬁeld,
because most of these boys come-
from .schools with nice grass soc-
cer ﬁelds.”

When the new ﬁeld is com-
pleted, Bemis will no longer have
that problem. Neither will base-
ball coach Bobby Lewis, ‘whose!

teams have never had a ﬁeld they
could call their own, or tennis
coach Ben Pope who teams have
been forced to practice at two
courts and play matches at a
third. _

baseball and soccer ﬁeld, three dirt intramurall
ﬁ-elds and seven tennis courts. The cost is esti-
mated at $1,800,000.
