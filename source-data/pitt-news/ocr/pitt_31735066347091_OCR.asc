carried away an estimated $600

Dean Sell f D
Resigns Job  

Law School Dean W. Edward Sell
resigned yesterday, effective before
the start of the 1977-78 academic
year.

Sell submitted letters of resigna-
tion to the Provost’s Ofﬁce and the
Ofﬁce of the Chancellor and sent
open letters to Law Schoollfaculty
and students explaining the reasons

~ g for his resignation.

He said in his letters that he Had
accomplished his goals and “now it
is time for a new dean, with new
goals and aspirations.”

Sell, 53, began as an instructor in
Law in 1947 and has served as Dean
since 1966. *

“I’m convinced the burglary had
to be done by someone who knew
the area,” Campus Police detective
Charles Brevard said.

The point of entry, according to
Brevard, was -an advisor’s ofﬁce,
room 928, which has a door leading
to the center’s main section, suite
901, where student records are
kept.

“Suite 901"s door was locked. ’
The burglar would have had to know
the area to know that he could go
through 928 to get to 901,” Brevard
said._ . 

According to Brevard, Campus
Police believe the burglar was
looking for speciﬁc items because
some valuables were ignored.

“Only one little, section. was

broken into,” Kolec said. “At ﬁrst.
it looked haphazard, but . we,

remembered each ‘person’s ofﬁce
that was broken into has‘had tape
recorders or some other valuable

equipment in it in the last few.

The student files, according to
Koloc, were not disturbed.
Campus Police are continuing

- their investigation, but so far have

no suspects, according to Brevard.
“We have no suspects but quite
a bit of evidence,” Brevard said.
‘fWe are going to make compari-

Barbara Jordan, the . Texas
Congresswoman who keynoted the
July Democratic convention, prom‘-
ised yesterday that Jimmy Carter
and the Democratic party can solve
this nation’s problems.

Jordan, in a speech to Democrats
said that the President elected this
year will effect the nation’s policies
for at least a decade, and she dared
them to vote for anyone but Jimmy
Carter.

“Jimmy Carter is a new breed of
politician. People are tired of

-having their dreams bracketed in

budgetary ﬁgures, and the Ameri-
can people are weary of politicians

I 1‘ who talk as if the people are

responsible for their own prob-
lems,” Jordan said. “When Jimmy
Carter talks about 7.5 million

people who need jobs.” .

The University pfbposal offers a’

_ compensation of $70 per week with

The University is offering two
weeks vacation after one full year of
service, the source reported.
Vacation would increase to three
weeks for five full years of service
and to four weeks for 20 full years of

, service.

The Campus Police union,
Amalgamated.Plant Guards Local

years of service and six weeks
vacation for 20 years of service. This
proposal was modeled after the.
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic clerical workers contract. The
clerical workers contract was signed
by the University in February.

"The University’s proposal ..does
not include pregnancy beneﬁts for
the force's recently recruited’
females and the union is requesting
the addition of these beneﬁts to the
University's proposals.

‘ The number of holidays offered
to the Campus Police is also an issue A

in the negotiations, the source '

reported. The University proposal

offers seven holidays; New Year's

Day, Great American’s Day,

Memorial Day, Independence Day, ’
Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and’

Christmas Day. . g

The Campus Police union is
requesting the addition of four more
holidays that are included for
employes covered by the clerical
workers’ contract and for other
University employes. They include; ‘
Martin Luther King Day, the day
after Thanksgiving, New Yearis

CAE, Student Gov '1‘
Conflict At Meeting

BY R’1CH HARRY

Nearly 20 members of the
Collective for Alternative Educa-

day’s Student Government Board

exchange with the board.

The CAE members walked out
after they waited to present an
appeal to a committee on Student
Organization (CSO) recommenda-
tion that revoked their status as a
fully recognized student organiza-
tion. They were not allowed to
present the appeal, which they had

after the meeting that “a lack of

Law StuclentsObiect To

BY WILLIAM RENKUS
‘Members of Pitt’s School of Law
expressed dissatisfaction with the
reallocation of the graduate student
activities fee at a meeting yesterday
of the Graduate and Professional

Student Association (GPSA).

The law school members objected '_ V
.that the GPSA allocation. system

returns an equal percentage of
funds to the small graduate schools
as to their’s, which is the largest,
representing 600 members.

Each school presently receives an
equal share in the 78% turned back
to all graduate schools by the GPSA,
according to GPSA chairperson
Sandra Debourelando.

GPSA receives two dollars in
activities fees from each full-time
student and one dollar from each
part-time graduate -student for its
total funding, according to De-
bourelando.. .

“I am not sure all of the graduate
students are beneﬁtting from the

money they are paying in activities.

fees,” Debourelando "said, “In
some cases the graduate schools
'aren’t providing services and the

money is going into a few hands.”'

A proposal to increase the
amount of money turned back to all
respective graduate schools for
fiscal year 1978‘will be voted on at

Activity Fee Allocation

the next meeting.

The establishment of a comput-
erized center to refer students and
faculty for information inisuch areas

as social services, activities and.

housing was proposed by GPSA
representative Boaz Lazenger.
,“The problem today is all the
information available is scattered
throughout_ the University,” Laz-
enger said. “This center would

provide a systemized way to obtain -

inform ation-. ’ ’ -

The projected costs of the center
would be between $50,000 and
$100,000, according to Lazenger.

He said he hopes funding for the
center would come from the
University. J

Proposals for free notorization for
graduate students and a better
media campaign to inform graduate
students on , issues important to
them were put forward by GPSA
member William Voharas.

_ Graduate students are upset at
the lack of graduate student
housing, according to Deboure-
lando. .

“We are losing prospective
graduate students because they are
forced to live in broken down
apartments not ﬁt to live in,”
Debourelando said. “We have
been ﬁled under forgotten.”

that Student Government commit-

Weisband pointed -out the

SGB members linked lack of

stressed tighter SGB control over

"70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh "

The responsibility of the Remunerations Board is very heavy. They
must interpret, each year, the policy they created to determine which
7 student government and student organization leaders are to be paid for
‘their services.
jlhe present Student Government Board has been reimbursed for its
services since last year. But it was not a proposal railroaded through

I , committees and quickly voted away, as some opponents would lead one

to believe. Rather, the system evolved through a careful legislative
process that began late in the Mike Furick administration in 1975.

It took a long time to set up a remunerations system. It would take an
equal length of time to get rid of it. v _
, Remuneration is not a recent campus innovation. Past student
government administrations have approved and set up reimbursement

_p systems. Theywouldoperate for afewmonthsorafewyears until a
I group of people would run for office and pledge to abolish remunerations

and work for free. Subsequent office holders would work without pay
until the remuneration idea came up again.

The present payment system receives its funds from the student
activities fee to the tune of $15,000 per year. This is according to a

- precedent set in 1974, which also called for $15,000 to be allocated frolr.
' . the activities fee. Until then, Pitt's budget supplied funds to reimburse

student leaders.

Much can be said to, explain. why student leaders should be
remunerated. Many donate so much time and effort to their positions
that they are unable to hold a job. Remunerations helps provide money

‘lost due to their efforts. ‘

. But the students have merely approved of remlmeration indirectly.
'lhey voted for the student oﬂicials who voted to create the remuneration
process. A more direct system of approval is needed. , Al voter

 referendum should be included on next winter’s student government

election ballot. Then the students who care enough to vote will have a
say in whether or not studeht leaders should receive money for their
services. I The result can be taken as a vote of confidence/ no conﬁdence
in the system. A
Opponents to the referendum ask where students ‘who oppose

remuneration were when the hearings were being held. Half were in_

high school and the others, well, even if they didn’t care thenit is still
their activities fee that is being spent. They have a right, in a democratic

~ system, to say where it goes.

Others claim that if the remunerationsn system ' is subject to
referendum then the whole allocations system also must be. If part of
the allocation system is to come under question then the entire system
must, they feel. But the present allocation system was approved by

- voter referendum in November 1972 by a nine-to-one  The

remunerationsystem has not been approved by referendum in recent
Pitt history.

disapproved. But it is a risk that must be made when student dollars are

Professor Jennikins

The)/II do Anything to

BY MATTHEWAKENNEDY

The University community is
agog over the possibility of courses
here that describe in some detail
the goings on in black magic circles
and so on and so forth.

The ‘history of mysticism in
academic circles has always been a
checkered one, so it comes as no
surprise that the issue touches a
raw nerve in the bodies of so many
otherwise stoic souls at Pitt. .

One stoic soul in particular was a
professor named ‘Jennikins, ‘ who
can generally be found in th
drearier confines of an rank and

airless bar room on the corners of _

the campus. 1 .
As it happens some unfortunate
soul had brought up the subject of
Halloween, and v another fellow-
drunk described in lurid detail his
favorite paperback, “I was a Naked .
Witch in the Beds of Powerful’
Men.” '
Ordinarily a loud-mouth, Jenni-
kins was particularly piqued at the
mention'*of sorcercy and immedi-
ately began to raise his voice.
“Don’t tell me about black
magic,” J ennikins said ferociously,
waving a glass‘ of Stroh’s around
like a weapon. ' ’
“Right now there are people who
call themselves faculty members
who give credence to every demon
monger that comes down the »
pike,” J ennikins said viciously. “If
I has my way with those scum, I'd
have them all rounded up. and

 .  BY mm wAsELEsKl

Jimmy Carter's Playboy inter-

Y ,.view- (the whole thing) hit the
’ newsstands this week, and no

doubt a, lot of Ford supporters
blushed more at it than at Miss
November.

The Democratic nominee's now
famous remark on “lust” comes at
the end of nine solid pages of
questions and answers that remark-
ably serves to dispel more inquiries
about Carter than issue any new
ones.

The ﬁnal interviewing session
was over, a Carter aid had opened
the frontodoor of the Plains home

» _ for Robert Scheer, the writer of the

article, and Playboy assistant

p managing editor G. Barry Golson.

The former Georgia governor

"then ‘went into ‘what Scheer ,
‘ describes as “along, softly spoken
monologue that grew in intensity as -

lie made his ﬁnal points.” _
They mentioned. to’ Carter that

  

V religion,

   

nodded his assent and, according

to Golson in. a New York Times

article, he discussed “small_-town

human temptation_.’.’

In the course of that talk no

newsman later chose to seize on the
line, “I don't accept any domina-

tion of my life by the Baptist

Church, none,” which is about as
close as one can come to
repudiating one’s own religion
after being dogged on it incessantly
by the press, despite a John
Kennedy’s supposed shattering of
the religion barrier 16 years ago.
No, they breezed right over that
one, just like so many others they
let go by, answers that wouldn’t
have created the sensational
headlines the “lust” remark did,
but answers that would've claridied
the picture, suggesting Carter was
only as fuzzy as the press’ view of
him‘ was blurred. - . _
Answers like the one he gave to
they _' ‘fuzzy’ " a ‘issue itself: I;

members of ‘Congress. When any

. -question on an issue came up, they

Corman bill on health care, period,
no matter what's in it.’ If the
question was on employment, they
would say, ‘I'm for the Humphrey-
Hawkins bill, no matter what’s in
it.‘ But those bills were constantly

‘ being amended!  .

‘-‘..'..On _human rights, civil
rights, environmental quality, I

ment, on openess of government, '

attitudes‘ are incompatible.” '

a thrust through their hearts.”

The Trotskyite who ,sits in the
rear of the establishment, eyes
ever pinned to the front door,
ventured a small remark.

“Religion is the opium of the
masses,” the Trotskyite uttered.

“Go ahead idiot. Scoff,”

Jennikins said. “I happen to know .

personally that many of these
so-called scholars-at the University
will dabble in anything -to get
published, not to mention national
prestige.” _ '

“‘It was about two years ago at
the department that I spent a late
night in my office, working on
midterms. I was disturbed by

what seemed to be incoherent

noises issuing from the end of the
hall.

“Imagine my fear and disgrace
when, upon investigating, I saw
Doctor Hoboken, stripped to the
waist, dancing around a candle in

the center of the darkened hall.

- Jennikins took a pause ‘to_build
the tension of the scene, adding the
theatrical gesture of squinting and
visoring his balding forehead with
an equally balding right hand.

“Hoboken squeaked in alarm, .
stooped to grab some papers on the -

floor and shot down the stariway. I
chased him down to the third ‘ﬂoor,
but he dissappeared in. a puff of
smoke.” ’

“so what,” croaked a dean,‘

curled up by the taps. A. ‘

“So what? I’ll tell you so

than a month later one of my
monographs was rejected by a
national publication because they
said they'didn't have room in that
issue. And guess who-got his work

xprinted? Hoboken; T_hat’s “who!

 

Publish

“So what?” the dean muttered
and sank off his stool and onto the
ﬂoor.

Jennikins emptied half his glass '

of beer on the stricken man's head.

“Ever since then I take great-
precautions with my written work,

 Public Utilities Are’

BY GEORGE W. DULL

Calvin Coolidge, who got into the
White House on the strength of one
now-classical, sentence, “There is
no right to strike against the public
safety by anybody, anywhere,
anytime,” and who withdrew from
the White House politics with an
equally classical sentence, “I do
not coose to run for President in
1928,” would have been the ideal
Republican nemesis for the propo-
nents of television debates. Cal
Coolidge liked to suggest, now and

Last winter in Pittsburgh it
wasn’t quite as cold as Cal’s' New
England winters, but a couple of
old people did freeze to death
because their gas supply had been
cut off. These were tragic
incidents. No more - no less. They
occurred because it was legally
possible for them to occur.

Public Utilities Are

Public Necessities

(Continued from Page 4)

these are all accepted by everyone,
everywhere, everytime, as public
utilities, plainly a case of yester-
day’s luxury now become. today’s
necessity.

Today the question once more
stands before the American public,
“What is a public utility?” Since
today’s university students are the
taxpayers of tomorrow, and the
welfare recipients of a more remote
tomorrow, this question about
utilities directly concerns them.
Any debate, decision and conse-
quent policy-making about public
utilities cannot be left to only
corporate executives and politi-
cians - the general public must now
be included and not in the usual
surreptitious manner - open meet-
ings advertised in buried print in a,
daily newspaper. 5

Water, light and heat are no

. longer. just conveniences.. They are

basic ‘necessities in the material
culture and their availability affects
the common welfare. - The
production and ‘distribution of
water, light and heat should not be
left in elite hands or the control of a
select few; these are systems which
belong in the public domain and
must be put there. The utility
companies must be nationalized.
Such nationalization is long over-'
due. This is not to suggest a raise
in taxes but to emphasize a better
distribution of any profits - or,
better yet, the elimination of profits
where household consumption of
water, light and gas is concerned.
Thereare two other “conven-
iences”_ which are no longer

' "luxuries. These are the telephone

and. reasonably, with room for

argument I freely admit, television _

and telecasting.

The telephone is a "matter of ,
individual and community security
and well-being. Those who need
such service, especially the aged,

should be provided with local
service without charge. This
service should be unlimited. It

should include the right to gossip

’ for, in an emergency, the gossip

networks in a community frequent-
ly function more efficiently than do
the public ones. '
Television? Because broadcast-
ing and telecasting corporations
use airwaves they do not own,
airwaves which belong to all living
creatures, and without which free
use the corporations would soon be
out of proﬁts or out of existence, it
is only just "that television be
considered a public-utility in the

— mostyconcretef sense. For those

people without wage income, a TV
set and service should be provided"
- free. - ~
Further, there should be a public
television channel supported by the
government on which advertising

and propaganda_ of any nature”,

would be proscribed by law and the
proscription effectively enforced.
As of now no such channel exists in
the US. In the face of repressive,
selﬁsh entrepreneurshippassing as
free enterprise, little argument can
arise here about the free press or
Only the printed
sources of news and information
merit the protection of the First
Amendment.

It is high time to make utility
companies utilitarian for all. My_
thinking here is traditional; the
common good and the welfare of
individuals, as something other
than the economists’ "random
particles to be - dealt with by
computerized dehumanization,'
takes precedence over other
considerations in this case. The
onus-here is'on the elected leaders‘ ,

‘ -.1

  

If our politically chosen leaders
fail to act then organized protest
and forceful demonstration against
the utility companies is certainly
germane and worth thinking about.

Let me elicit the shades of the
Boston Tea Pary.
If the idea of putting the utility

_companies in the public domain

seems radical, let me point out that
only a few years ago the 40-hour »
work week, the minimum wage,
over-time pay, social security,
public health care, veterans’
beneﬁts, fair employment practices
and female suffrage, to name a
few, were radical ideas. George
Westinghouse, whose inventions
saved the lives of many railroad
men, was considered a radical by
some railroad operators.

Now the question “What is a
public utility?” belongs to the
young. It is properly a question for
discussion and debate by the
university-community at large.
Only here, on campus, there may
be hope of ﬁnding a solution
producing-common beneﬁts for all
Americans. I

craziness, one of them a passion tor
drugs.

“We’ll, in the ﬁrst place,”
Carter said, ‘‘I’m a human being.
I’m not a packaged article that you
can put in a little box and say,
‘Here's a Southern Baptist, and
ignorant Georgia peanut farm_er
who doesn’t have the right to enjoy
music, who has no ﬂexibility in his
mind, who can’t understand the
sensitivities of an interpersonal
relationship. He’s gotta be
predictable. He’s gotta be for
Calley and for the war. He’s gotta

be a liar. He’_s gotta be a racist.’ ”,

Blame it on just a tired Carter
tongue, or credit Scheer’s caginess
as an interviewer, but Carter, at
any rate, isn’t dodging on foreign
intervention (“I would never
intervene for the purpose of
overthrowing a government.”), the
Mayaguez affair (Playboy: “So_ it’s
a matter of degree; you would have

intervened militarily, too. Carter: I i

I would have done everything
necessary to keep the crew from

being taken to the mainland,»

yes.”), drug use and homosexual-
ity_ (“Victimless crimes, in‘ Vmy
opinion, should have-_ a very low

 

 

 

r

priority in terms of_'enforcing the
laws on the books."), the right of
journalists to maintain their
sources’ secrecy (‘‘I would do
everything I could to protect the
secrecy of sources for the news
media.”).

But the hottest potato in the
whole interview is one that isn't
issue-oriented or related to “1ust.”
It's one that Carter tosses at Scheer
and his profession: “The traveling
press have zero interest in any

issue unless it’s a matter of making:-_ ‘jig
a mistake....There’s nobody in the , 

back of this plane who would ask. an

issue question unless he thought he ’ 

could trick me into some crazy
statement.’ ’

Which Carter now knows is true

only to the point where he. tricks; 
himself into making some crazy 

statement, something I’m still
waiting for after reading the full
Playboy interview.

An elderly Russian woman
approached the two young Ameri-
can tourists and pleadingly shoved
a paper into their hands. The letter
said, “I have relatives in America.
lwant to go to America. Please tell
them._,” The,Americans nervously

‘ agreed and walked away rapidly.

“I was nervous. I had been told
about the KGB. We were
American’s and we were news-
worthy. Iwanted to stay neutral,”
said Vickie Dym, one of the two
women ‘involved in the above
situation. ’

Dym, a senior in philosophy and
classics at Pitt, .went to Russia as a
delegate of the -American-Soviet
Youth Forum, which participated in
the ﬁfth annual, American-Soviet
Young People's Conference in
Kiev, Ukraine this past August.

“I really thought I was going to
Russia to tour around,” Dym said.
“I’ve been to many conferences in
the;U.S. and they were low-keyed,
but this was totally different. To
the Soviets, I was an American
delegate coming to the Soviet
Union to present views on
American policy, on foreign pol-
icy,” Dym said.

Dym applied for the program"

early last summer and was put on
the waiting list because too many
women were already accepted. In
June, she received notice of her
acceptance and petitioned the Vira
I, Heinz Fund of the Pittsburgh
Foundation to sponsor her trip.

The cost of the whole trip to
Russia was $800, a sum which Dym
acknowledges is “incredibly inex-
pensive.”

“The Comsomal party (youth
party) paid for everything, our
hotels, our meals,” Dymsaid.

American‘ In Russia Gets Red Carpet Treatment

Vickie Dym, a Pitt senior, was one of 50 American studepts to attend
the fifth annual American-Soviet Young People’s Conference in Kiev,
Ukraine this past summer. Fifty Soviet youths also attended the

conference.

Fifty Americans met with 50
Soviet young people (“In Russia,
young means from age 19 to age
35"), in Kiev from August 14 to 28.

The American group left New
York on the 14th, and landed in
Moscow and proceeded to tour the
city for two days. They traveled to
Kiev next to officially open the
conference. Five days later they
left for Leningrad. After four days
in Leningrad, they found them-

selves back at their starting point,
Moscow.

A group of Soviet workers visited
Pittsburgh, and according to Dym,
who co-hosted the group, the
American treatment of the Soviets
was much different than her
reception.

’ “TV cameras were everywhere
we went,’ Dym said. “When we
were in Pravda, I was interviewed
by radio Kiev. We stayed in the

I town.

best hotels. We had police escorts

wherever we ‘went. We saw
factories and ‘met with their
directors, the bigwigs. The

Soviets didn't mess around. They
were very concerned with Ameri-
cans meeting Soviets. They were
trying to make a great impression

on us.”

According to Dym, the Soviets
got a totally different type of
reception in Pittsburgh. “Very few
people knew they were here and
they stayed in the YMCA down-
But it's American not to
make a big deal about things like
this,” Dym said.

“When we got off the train at
Kiev, a band was there waiting.
When we went to the theater the
whole theater stood up to greet us.
It was obvious they were trying to
impress us,” Dym said.

After a few days of coping with a
rigorous schedule, some of the
American delegates demanded free
time to explore the cities, and got
it.

“In Moscow, there is a feeling of
dead air around that really grabs
your throat. A lot of things there
were gray. The department stores
were lots of long corridors with a lot
of gray items,” Dym said.

“They had a great war there,
World War II, and you can still see
a great amount of destruction in
Moscow. After you’ve been there
you can see how the communist
state arose. The people needed
solidarity to survive,” she said.

It was the Soviets themselves,
and not just their cities, that
interested the Americans, accord-
ing to Dym.

“A lot of American delegates at
the conference weren't that bright.
The Russian-s had people who were
extremely well-informed. They
talked in statistics,” Dym said.
“At the conference when asked
questions the Americans would
respond with ‘I feel this,’ or ‘My
experienceﬂjs this’, but when we
asked the Soviets how they felt
"about an issue they. were dumb-

founded. In the conference
situation their opinions didn't
matter.

Although it was hard to get close
to the Soviets in conferences, it
became ,much easier in personal
situations. “We would be sitting at

.a dinner and toasting and they

would open up. There still is
something in a- smile, in atoast that
gets around idealogy,” Dym said.-

Some of the American delegates,

according to Dym, were paranoid -

about being in Russia and meeting
the Russian people and" others were
not.

initiated into the communist party

during their stay in the Soviet »

Union. _

“They had a ceremony which the
other delegates weren’t- allowed to
attend,” Dym said.

Dym and her companions had v

their share of tourist troubles in
Russia. She and her roommate had
a typically “American in a foreign
country” confrontation with their
Russian laundress.

“She knew we were American
and dumb and told us our laundry
would cost 40 rubles (52). We had
a few items but not $52 worth. Our
translator haggled her down to 20
rubles, about $30, which was still
crazy,” Dym said.

“We then realized that jeans

I were in the wash. She had decided

that since jeans were expensive in
Russia, they must be expensive to
wash too. We wound up giving her
bubblegum for her kids and 5
rubles,” she said. A

The American delegates, while

exploring the Russian cities,’

managed to get a sense of Russians
as a people, according to Dym.

.“I broke a lot of my cultural
mythology when I was there. I
never realized" how much James
Bond and~Dr.‘Zhivago were in the
back of my_..mind when I though of
Russia,” she said.

“The whole formula of the
conference was one of great

Graduate School of Public Health at
Pitt has been awarded a research
grant from the Division of Heart and
Vascular Disease of the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute

the epidemiological investigation of
high blood pressure in the young.

The grant will study the
‘ ‘tracking’ ’ of blood pressure levels
in children, testing the hypothesis
that one’s blood pressure_ levels
relative to other individuals of the
same age is ﬁxed early in life, so
that individuals tend to remain in
the same track as they grow older,

Attention all graduate educati-
on students. The Council of
Graduate Students in Education
(CGSE) wants you.

The main purpose of the CGSE, in
its fourth year of operation, is to
represent all graduate education
students. It has representatives on
all School of Education administra-
tion and School of Education
committees.

The CGSE hosts an annual
education colloquium, where grad-
uate students have the opportunity
to present papers on issues in the
ﬁeld of education. These papers are
published and bound and copies are
distributed throughout the Univer-
sity.

“The Colloquium creates a
platform for ideas. The students
present position papers on a phase
of education. Tlie»Colloquium gives
them a chance to have their work in
print,” according to Vera Gouke
Howard, the coordinator of the
CGSE.

The CGSE also publishes a A

quarterly newsletter called “Cog-
.nose.” The newsletter lists
meetings, services and activities of
concern to graduate education
students.

Rap sessions, are held four or ﬁve
times a month and serve as a place
to discuss_ problems with both
faculty, advisors’and other graduate
education students.

Another service of the CGSE is an
expanded course description for all
courses in the School of Education.
This description includes a week-by

course,
grading optionsfrequirements and
texts required. It states’ the course
objectives according to the instruc-
tor as well as the class ‘ size
expectations and prerequsites.

The CGSE has instituted two new
services this year. The first is.a
publishing workshop.

“As educators, we are expected
to publish,” Howard said. _“The
workshop offers many new educati-

onal experiences for the graduate
education students.”

‘The workshop, according to
Howard, will inform students on the
“ins and outs’ ’ of the publishing
business. _ \. 4

The newest and most functional
service of ,the CGSE is an
information and referral center.
The center opened in January,
1976, and is allied with the graduate
pre-admission center which is
located in the same ofﬁce. L

The center is designed to provide
information on “what is available
on campus” to both old and new
students. The center sponsors a
mini-orientation to allow the
students time to ask questions.

I Also available at the center are
lists of agencies that offerhelp for
such matters as employment,
housing, health, counseling, ﬁnan-
cial aid and other non-academic

Swine Flu--A Virus

A With a Vengeance

\.

BY BILL HUSACK

Swine inﬂuenza is radically
different from the influenza viruses
that have previously’ infected the
U.S. population and therefofe is
potentially dangerous.

It is unlikely that many Ameri-
cans have natural protection
against swine ﬂu since it has been

45 years since. any widespread:

human outbreak. ‘

The swine flu vaccine is a dead
virus vaccine. ‘Therefore, it is
impossible to contract inﬂuenza
from the administration of the
vaccine. Yet the dead viruses
cause the human body to produce’
effective antibodies against live
viruses.

Members of the general popula-

tion, 18 to‘ 65 years of age, will

receive the mbonovalent vaccine
(A/New Jersey); including preg-
nant women, who are encouraged
to take the vaccine. Members of

"the “high risk”— population will

   

 

receive a bivalent vaccine (A/ New
Jersey and A/Victoria).

This high risk_ group consists of

and ofﬁpeople jhaving; ~ pchronic

pulmonary disease, chronic heart
disease (particularly with rheuma-
tic heart disease), mitral stenosis,

diabetes mellitus, weakness or
paralysis of respiratory ‘muscles,

chronic liver or kidney diseases and
heavy smokers.

‘In addition, any member of the
general population who has a
known allergy to egg protein,
presently has a fever or _has
received any oth_er type of
vaccination with 14 days should
receive special doctors attention.

Information to date indicates that
ﬁve to ten .-percent of those
vaccinated will show an incidence

Lack of Nationalist
Fire Cause of War

BY PAUL MATHEWS

The current civil war in Lebanon
is the result of internal and external
forces "struggling to build a nation
where there is no nation, Israeli
political scientist Dr. Gabriel Ben
Dor said in a lecture at ‘Pitt
Wednesday. '

The crisis inLebanon stems from
internal forces attempting to Work
toward a compromise between the
political demands of various ethnic
and religious groups and an attempt
by Syria to balance the power of
these groups in such a way that
Syria could manipulate the govern-
ment to its own advantage, Ben

' Dor said.

“There is an absence of
nationalism in Lebanon,” Ben Dor
said, “because Lebanon was carved

by colonial powers and has no .
. history of its own. Lebanon lacks

the common cultural framework
essential to an effective political
community,” he said.

Cultural heritage necessary for
the creation of a nation requires
more than a ﬂag, a national anthem

and a vote in the U.N., he said. “It ‘

requires an understanding of the
complexity of nation building and a
feeling of nationalism that is strong
enough to supersede the particular
religious and ethnieloyalities felt by
the people,” he said.

In this sense, the, ‘crisis in
Lebanon reflects some of the
problems experienced by the‘
United States during its civil war,”
Ben Dor said. '

‘ ‘Lebanon is the last Arab state to
come to terms with nation building.
The other Arab nations have solved
this problem, and they paid a heavy
price. Lebanon is paying that price
now,” he said.

Ben Dor said the civil war is
essentially between the minority
Christians on the right, generally
considered thewealthy class, and a
majority alliance of Moslems and
Palestinians on the left, the working
class. .

The Christians, until recently,

held the majority in Parliament. The

crisis occurred as a result of the la 

Moslems’ and Palestinians’ at-

tempt to oust theIChristians from 
power and gain the dominant “ 
position necessary for their effec-V 

tive representation ‘in parliament.

“The Arabs and Palestinians do 

not feel the current power structure
reﬂects the demographic realities in
Lebanon,” Ben Dor said. V .
According to Ben Dor, with the
help of the Syrians the leftists were

able recently to force the Christians 7 '

into consenting to an equal

distribution of political control. _ The... 
Syrians, he said, were pleased with . 
this arrangement because‘ it upset « ,
the status quo and gave them the if
opportunity to mediate and judge
the government, giving them an 

advantage over the Israelis.”

new agreement because they are
the majority in Lebanon and they

want majority rule. They felt with a ‘ 

little more push“ from the Syrians,

the Christians could have been — ‘ll
brought to their knees and the’

‘power structure reversed to a leftist
majority in parliament. ~

The result, Ben Dor said was the 4 

leftist continuation of the fighting

and the Syrianyfsydecision to impose 7 
their own peace force in an attempt’ - ~'

to make the leftistsjcomply with the
Christian compromise.

Fighting has now broken out. 

between the Syrians" and the
Lebanese leftists, Ben Dor said. .
“The fighting will continue in
Lebanon until a strong enough
feeling of nationalism is cultivated

to overcome the present animosity -

between actions, or until the
Syrians can negotiate a peace
settlement by focusing the attention
of the warring factions on the Israeli
problem,” he said.

" Ben Dor-added that he doesn't
think peace will come to the Middle
East until the Arab states recognize
they can not destroy the. Israeli

Peer Contraceptive Education is
a new program being offered by the
Student Health Service. Student
volunteers are trained to inform
other students about birth control
and the services available to them
at the Health center.

Designed by Gerry Hyner, Pitt’s
health educator and Janet Devoe, a
registered nurse, the program was
initiated last month and is funded
by the $16 student health fee.

The 10 volunteers are all female,
according to Devoe, and are mostly
student nurses or Graduate School
of Public Health students. “Each
volunteer had to undergo a six to
eight week training session’ ’ Devoe
said. “Twenty-four new peer

‘educators are now being trained.

Male volunteers are welcome and

encouraged since a team approach
is used in the sessions."

The volunteers are taught about
pelvic examinations, lab tests and
all available methods of birth
control. “The system was
designed because students relate
better to other students,” Devoe
said. She said she hopes the
volunteers stay with the program
as long as they remain at Pitt.

The Peer Contraceptive Educa-
tion service is available upon
request to any student or organiza-
tion. So far, according ‘to Devoe,
the volunteers have spoken to
sororities —and various dormitory
groups about contraceptive meth-
ods. ‘

The volunteers also offer their
services on a one-to-one student
basis within the Family Planning
Clinic, utilizing ﬁlms, slides, and

«other visual aids in their demon-
strations.

Beforelthe health fee and the

covers a full range of services,
including examinations.

The Student Health Service’s
gynecology service covers a broad-
er range of gynecological pro-
blems, according to Devoe, than
the family planning services does.

Birth control inquiries should be
directed to the Family Planning
Clinic only, and services are
available on an appointment basis.
The Peer volunteers plan to be on
hand at Pitt's diagnostic clinic, Oct.
19 and 20, Devoe said.

Colombia Field Trip Slated

BY MARK PRESCOTT

If a two-month trip to Colombia
has always been your dream, then
the Latin American studies program
should interestyou. ~ _

Pitt’s Center for Latin America
Studies is offering an undergrad-
uate certiﬁcate in Latin American
studies to students who participate

in a winter term research seminar‘

and a spring session ﬁeld trip to

Colombia.

Twelve students, will be chosen
for the program on the basis of their
knowledge of the Spanish language,
emotional stability, self-motivation
and academic standing, according
to Robert Henderson, director of the
program.

- Those chosen will then take part
in a research seminar next term to
prepare themselves for the spring
session trip to Colombia. The
seminar, according to Henderson,
will give the students background in
the history, geography and social
structures of the’ regions in
Colombia that they will visit.
“Participants will design their
own individual research projects
and will also work on their
knowledge of the Spanish language
during the winter seminar,”
Henderson said.

According to Henderson, nine
credits will be earned for the
successful completion of the
seminar and the ﬁeld trip. These
credits will be applied ‘to the
certiﬁcate and also will be generally
accepted in the student's major
department.

The itinerary of the Colombian
ﬁeld trip is as follows: The ﬁrst
week will be spent in Bogota, the
next ﬁve days in Manizales and the
ﬁnal week divided between Med-

’ ellin and Cartagena.

V Manizales, according to Hender-
son, is the focal point of the trip.
Manizales, which is called “The city
of open doors, ’ ’ is the leading coffee
growing region of all Colombia. It is
there, Henderson said, students
will reside with Colombian families
and conduct research for their
projects. 7

Henderson, who lived in Mani-
zales for three years said, “It’s a
very attractive _and friendly city
which is located in the Central
Range of the Andes. The weather is
like spring all year round.” .

Manizales also has three univer-
sities, according to Henderson,
which will be great resources for the

students when working on their‘

research projects.
“I must stress to all applicants
that this is not a vacation but a

research program. But this does not
mean that students will not enjoy
themselves and have fun, Hender-
son said. Mainly they will be on
their own and will be expected to
create their own opportunities and
make their own Colombian‘ acquain-
tances.”

_ The deadline for applications was
to be today, but according to
Henderson, it will be extended
indeﬁnitely. Fo1;_more information,

American Studies, 216 Mervis Hall.

Previn at Helm of TV‘ Series

BY PAMELA EUSI

“Pink tickets in rows A-T. Try to '

’ ﬁll in the rows in front of the camera
ﬁrst.” With trepidation I thanked
the usher and sank into a plush
velvet seat in front of the camera.

"The “Big Event” was the
WQED-'_I'V taping of a Pittsburgh
Symphony rehearsal with Andre
Previn at the helm.

I was pretty early and since there
wasn’t much to attract my attention,

"I focused my thoughts on what was
happening onstage. Ilistened as a
couple of violinists practiced the
difficult runs and a clarinetist
played with a melody. Someone
(probably the orchestra librarian)

' - came out to arrange the music on

the conductor’s stand.

The high society of Pittsburgh

swished its way into special box
seats. A cellist immediately in front
of ‘me bowed some furious 16th
notes. Is this all for show, to make it
look good in the eyes of the
“beautiful people?”

Everyone probably is trying to
make it look good. That’s why this
taping is scheduled—to make the
orchestra look good, to shpw
America that Pittsburgh ’ s orchestra
is good. And why not in this year of
candidates’ debates (actually rather
"moderated chats)? Why can’t the
Pittsburgh Symphony take a stab at

’ TV? It seems everybody else is.

Beginning in early 1977 on the

~Public Broadcasting System,

WQED will present Previn and the
Pittsburgh Symphony in a series of
eight programs about various

 

ANDRE PREVIN

pieces of music and featuring
guests from the musicprofession.
This week's taping, the first of the
series, is tentatively entitled “Who
Needs to Rehearse?” and explores
the reasons for rehearsal in _a
professional orchestra.

The entourage for the taping
included a two-ton camera in the
middle‘ of a main aisle, four other
large cameras ‘staged around the
hall, 18 microphones, Previn’s
director from the British ‘Broadcast-
ing Company, Ian Engelmann.
Working with him’ was his assistant
director, Rosemary Sadler, WQED
producer Virginia Bartlett and a
score of technicians and assorted

Buddy Gage’s pedal steel guitar is ‘

“Fifteen Days Under the Hood”
opens the album on a light note.
The blended lead vocals of Nelson,

bassist Skip Battin ring through
crystal clear and Gage’s twangy
pedal steel medley is engaging.

The New Riders are one of .the
few bands who -can _ graft a tune
from another band or artist and do
justice to it. Nine of the 10 songs
on New Riders fall into this

‘ Chuck Barry's “You Never Can

searched for reassurance from the

_ Confusion reigned supreme as the,

technicians became busier with
each moment bringing them closer
to the taping.

The couple next to me was
engrossed in locating all of the
cameras for the broadcast. People
with headsets and microphones on
stage. Some‘
schoolgirls in back of me liked their
seats because their position afford-

attired in a red velvet cape swooped
down the aisle. She certainly ﬁts
right in here’, I thought. The lights
dimmed for the umpteenth time.
Everybody was gawking at every- —

Cameramen took their places

behind machines that wield such

enormous power, A cellist bent
down to talk to a handicapped lady

Mexican, Indian

Dances Celebrated

BY DENISE DAILBY

It’s rare to see a culture come
alive with such style and ﬂair as
Mexico’s Ballet Folklorico did on

Wednesday evening. They treated .

the audience at Heinz Hall with
colorful costumes and lively songs
and dances from more than 20
authentic Mexican fiestas, along
with several beautifully executed
Indian ritual dances.

This company, based in Mexico
City, has travelled throughout the
world sharing Mexican history and
society with other people. They
create‘ a unique style of dance

performance based on authentic

folk song and dance, but it is Ballet
that is never far removed from its
simple origins. '

The themesof the dances span the
full range of a long and diverse
Mexicanvheritage, from Pre-Colum-
bian Indian ritual and sacriﬁce
through colonial times of European
inﬂuence, to modern forms of
Mexican fiesta and ceremony.

The performance opened with an
intricate folk dance of “Los
Matachines.” The entire company
ﬁlled the stage in brilliantly colored
costumes. They began slowly,
weaving around each other with
heel-clicking steps—all to the beat
of a solitary drummer. By the end of
the dance, the ever increasing
rhythm of the drum had reached a
frantic pace, and ‘-the dancers’
clicking and swirling was an
Impressionistic blurr of color with
sound.

“Los Totanacas” provided a»
radical change of style. This dance
reveals one of the many rich
pre-Colombian cultures in Mexico,

th at of the Totanacas of the eastern

P and freedom of a noble animal that

coast. Their myths and rituals have
survived to this day.
consisted of two solo dances by the
Sun and Moon and a ritual dance by
tribe members in adoration of each.
Particularly interesting was the
“Dance of the Women Who Sing to
the Moon—Cihuatetotl.” The dim
lighting and slow, repetitive
movement created an eerie, hyp-
notic effect.
The most powerful solo perfor-—
mance was Emilio Ceron in “Danza
Del Venado” (The Deer Dance). It
is all the more exciting because the
dance is part of a living ceremony
among the Yaquis Indians of
northern Mexico. This tribe of
Indians, which remains an autono-
mous culture, continues to perform
this ritual dance before the hunt. It
is believed the magical power of the
hunted animal is acquired by
enacting its life and death through
dance.
In theBallet Folklorico’s version,
Ceron dances beautifully as_ he
creates a full image of the strength

is stalked and ﬁnally killed by two
Indian hunters. The boldness and
vitality of this piece were the
highlight of the program.

The company concluded the
evening with a-rousing performance
of the “Jarabe Tapatio”—more
commonly known as the Mexican
Hat Dance. Multi-colored stream-
ers were sent flying out into the
audience as musicians and dancers

persuaded the folks from Pittsburghii _
,.

,_z

to let loose and clap along.

Pittsburgh audiences should look
forward to future concerts being
brought by the Pittsburgh Dance
Council. The Ballet Folklorico de
Mexico was a fascinating glimpse of ’
a rich history and colorful society.

spy-thriller, is all that as paranoid’s
dream—or nightmare——could hope '
to be. The plot, when it comes to the
surface, is that old tale of an
innocent man suddenly ﬁnding
himself in the proverbial web of
intrigue, none of which he is able to '
understand. And he finds that
wherever he turns—ah, yes, the
old paranoia game.

Dustin Hoffman R stars as a ‘
graduate history ‘student, the
“innocent” man (a concept neatly
questioned in the ﬁlm’s context).
With him (or against_ him) are _
Laurence Olivier as a cool-minded
Nazi fugitive, Roy Scheider as a .
perfectly cast, efficient killing
machine, William DeVane as the
soft-spoken villain‘-type and Marthe
Keller (the only woman in the cast)
who is little more than an object in
her role as a foreign student.

Director John Schleslinger keeps
two parallel stories going neck and
neck for the ﬁrst hour and a half or
so, which may be a little plodding in ~
its resulting confusion. But then , as
the two storylines crash together,
the ﬁlm takes a turn into the
subcons'cious, dredging up the
favorite fears and nightmares.

The almost universal dread of
going to the dentist—a homely
enough act—is twisted into a

, horrible scene of torture, the sortof

BY JIM F ARERI

Self-proclaimed guitar virtuoso
Ted Nugent, America’s Ritchie
Blackmore, has erected another
monument to himself and American
rock’n ro1l——Free For All.

Nugent is a not too distant
descendant of the pre-Beatles era,
the 50s, the early days of rock when

the States still did the weaning.

There is no other recording guitarist
alive who has remained so
unimpressed by big rock names of
the last decade.

The progression from America’s
own early rock to Nugent’s Free-
For-All went unnoticed in the 60s
and early 70s. But now the final
product of a silent 15-year

evolution has arrived.

As in the embryonic stage of rock,
Free-For-All is strictly a straight-
forward album. What these men
can’t artfully create with their

A screaming vocal to ﬁll the gap. He

hands and mouths is left alone, and
for the better. Nugent has enough
talent and kick for 10 guitarists.

Nugent does a good job with th_e__~
old rock’n roll recipe of strong lead ‘

guitar supported by a thick, ever
present rhythm section. When the
guitar eases up, in comes Nugent’s

    
  
 

sounds like a country rock singer
energized by the corruption of the
city. Very American.

The best tracks are the fast ones.

Remember those fast 50s songs?-

Nugent does the same thing,
matching the quick chords and
drumbeats by racing his ﬁngers
along the fretboard. He hasn't
forgotten that rock and speed have a
tight, interdependent relationship.
Maybe being from Detroit has
something to do with it.

With one exception, all the cuts
on Free-For-All are worth their salt.
The high point of all of them comes

Engelmann stepped onstage to

explain brieﬂy about the taping and
that the audience would be pictured
at times in the program, that is ‘‘If
you’re good looking enough. If
you’re sitting next to someone
who’s not, ask them to move.”
After this short banter silence
overtook the hall_until Previn made
his entrance.

Dressed moderately in turtleneck
and knit slacks he addressed the
audience. Previn explained that the
point in rehearsing a professional
orchestra ’ is not so much the
execution of the music but the
cohesion of the conductor’s inter-
pretation of the piece with his
musicians.) He stressed the idea

- that “Every conductor has his own
interpretive likes and dislikes, his
own beliefs and his own failures.”

hear the oboes at bar 13, it’s too

After a rehearsal period, the
movement was played straight
through in ‘concert fashion. The
lights and tensions took their toll on
Previn. When he turned to speak to
the crowd again the beads of
perspiration rolled from his face.

A short break and then Previn
returned to explain the next piece,

looking for in this piece is rhythmic
clarity, subtleties of coloring and
some slight points of interpretation.

Rhythm was a slight problem for
the conductor. “The accent in each
group of six needs to be clearer.
Yes, what happens to the xylophone
before seven? Between bars 29 and
30 a lot of rhythmic hell is being
raised. Don't rush the triplets.”

Previn leaned into'the Spanish
melodies, blended with the rhythms
and danced to the music on the
podium. When he heard something
he liked he wasn’t afraid to let that
player know it. He encouraged the
oboe player at one point, “Now
really a broad triplet. That's nice.
Now stay there, that’s beautiful,
thank you.”

All the while the cameramen
glided their own instruments back
and forth as the.little red lights

blinked on and off at various places -

in the hall. Previn ended the
conducting of the recording of the
series’ theme music with a big
smile, turned to the audience and
said “And now comes the Beverly
Hillbillies or whatever,” acknow-
ledged the applause and walked off
the stage. And it was over.
The audience busied itself with
the task of leaving and I heard the
remnants of daily conversation
caught up again almost where they
were left off when the taping began.
The crowd’s callous reversion back
to the ordinary things of life shocked
and surprised me. Can't Pittsburgh
audiences ever rise about the
experience of living to appreciate
the touch of something other than
mundane?

Underrated Defense Called
To Deliver Panthers 1

.5 BY STEVESYBERT
Sports Editor

Lost somewhere between Tony Dorsett’s run for the Heisman Trophy,
the loss of, not one, but two ﬁrst-rate quarterbacks to injuries, and the
hanging questions "as to why the students at the number-two ranked
football school in the land don’t cheer, even when they ARE loaded and
feeling good, has been the more-than-outstanding play of the Pitt
Panther defense. ‘ I ,

. It could only happen in college football. In the _pros, which, for sheer
excitement, ranks nowhere near the collegiate game, the stress is placed
on defense and you all have, at one time or another, heard raging crowds
chanting “DEFENSE, DEFENSE”. and frightful tales of the Steel
Curtain, The Purple People Eaters and the Doomsday Defense.

But in college football, where the stress is placed on racking up those
points on the scoreboard, there are devices like diversiﬁed and exciting
offenses (the Wishbone, the Veer, etc.) taking the. place of the ordinary
“I” backﬁeld commonly used in the pros; there are the intense annual
rivalries; and there is the pageantry, and, especially, the cheerleaders.

So it’s not wonder you can still recite the Purple People Eaters of the

' Minnesota Vikings, but can't venture a guess at the Pitt front wall.
True, Dorsett is great. And so is Elliott Walker. And Gordon Jones.
And Jim Corbett, But let’s hear it for the defense, which has been
nothing short of super thus far and will be counted on even more now
that Pitt is faced with a quarterbacking dilemma and will perhaps not put
its regular amount of points on the board. ~

‘At present, the Panther defense is ranked high intwo of the four

9

5, yards per game on the ground (or less than what Dorsett gets on his own)
despite facing the most carries (240) of the top 15 teams rated.
The defense has given up only Spoints in ﬁve games (11.2 average)

and wouldhave had two shutouts (against Temple and I-Ollisville) had it _

not been for a pair of blocked. punts that were recovered in the end zone

manyoccasions orhave held after offensivelapses (12 lost fumbles, two-
interceptions) have given the ball away. ' ' ‘ ‘ ' -

our 50 in the second half,” said defensivecoordinator Bobby Roper,’
,.“and our defense gave up a total of minus two yards for the three
possessions.”_ ' . h _‘ T _ ' ' 
The individual‘e_fforts‘have been many. Bob J ury—-four interceptions.

3 Jeff Delaney——three interceptions. Randy Holloway-ﬁve quarterback
sacks. -Al Romano—three sacks. Arnie Weatherington and Jim
Cramer——60 tackles, apiece. Don Parrish—20 solo tackles. LeRoy
Felder—two interceptions returned for 50 yards. Add to that 10

recovered fumbles, an assortment ‘of batted down , passes and

immeasurable pressure and you have what might really be what makes"
Q‘ the Panthers tick. - I - ,
Holloway, Parrish and Romano are the leaders of the platoon,
according ‘to defensive line coach Jim Dyar. “That's the key to our
defense, the three inside people,” he said. “I learn a lot from them. I
like to ask them what they thinkvbecause they have a better feel of the
game by being in there than I do.” .
Opposing quarterbacks and runners also are learning a lot from the
Panther defense. Pitt is lucky. Hopefully it will take more than injuries

the defense tomorrow and'wave your red handkerchief just as fervently
as you do-’the‘green._ » " '

row with

defensive categories kept track of by the NCAA—-eighth in total‘
defense, the main 'category, allowing only 216 total yards perkgame to I
the opposition; and ninth in rushing defense, yielding a mere 113.8 ,

for touchdowns. ‘They have given the -ball over to the Pitt offense on‘ e‘

A “Our offense gave Louisville the ballthree times on turnovers inside "

“Miami not only has had this
history of playing against top-
ranked opponents,” Majors said,
“but they also have some very
strong and fast people to give you
quite a bitto be concerned about.
Their defensive line is one of the
quickest we’ve seen in several
years. And I feel it’s one of the
quickest and most mobile offensive
lines we’ve seen too.”

Majors believes, and is not
kidding himself, that Miami has the
ability to upset anyone on any day.
And ‘they do indeed have the
personnel. The team leader is 6-5,
248, Eddie Edwards, a senior
defensive tackle and All-America.
candidate who possesses ' burning
4.6 speed in the 40 despite his size.
Edwards, who recorded ﬁve sacks
in his first varsity game as a’
sophomore in 1974, could cause
some problems in the Pitt backﬁeld
if the quarterback (whoever it may
be) and the runners can't get their
timing together and properly run
the option.

But Edwards, who has seven
sacks already this season, will be
handicapped for tomorrow’s ' game
if he does play. 'The_key man in
Miami’s front wall has missed
practice for most of the week
because of the tragic death of his
mother in a trafﬁc accident.

Linebacker Earl Monroe and
safety Bryan Furguson supply the
other strong spots in the Hurri-
canes’ defense, which, if they know
anything at all about dealing with an
inexperienced quarterback, will be
keying -eight or nine men on Pitt's
potential problem solver,” Tony

rvuvev ' '

 

With the Pitt offense experiencing injury problems at theequarterback,

position, Cecil Johnson [60], David Logan [73] and the rest or the
Panther defensive platoon will be counted on if offensive problems

remain unsolved.

Dorsett, who. most likely will be
handed the ball more than the usual
amount of times. ,
The Pitt defense also will have a
tough job. The Hurricane backﬁeld
rates as one of the fastest in the
nation—-three members run a 4.5 in
the 40. Sophomore Ottis Anderson,-
the leading ground-gainer with 289
yards, is armed with cutting ability,
strength, power and quickness in

W getting through the holes that

Devlin photo pp
enabled him to log the most yards
(365) for a Miami freshman since
1945. .

Quarterback E.J. Baker, who was -

plagued with injuries as a freshman
a year ago, may miss the ‘contest
because of a sprained wrist. Senior‘
‘Frank Glover (18 for 36, 290 yards
last year) or junior George Mason (8
for 31, 99 yards) will be counted on
in case Baker cannot make an
appearance.

big, black ‘letters’ crying out-,
“TOMMYHAWK INDIANA.”
A These signs are not posted to
hide cracked brick or to cover
obscene pictures inked "on bulletin
boards, but rather to instill spirit
and enthusiasm——two well-known
words in Pitt fans’ vocabularies-
for the soccer match between the
Panthers (3-3-1) and up-and-com-
ing Indiana (Pa.) at 7' today at Pitt
Stadium. '

Why the move for enthusiasm?
Because that’s what Pitt needs if it
is to fulﬁll the hope of traveling to
the NCAA playoffs this year.

_ “We’re in good spirits _and good

should be a good game.
ready for it.”

You see, the Panthers, in order
to receive a playoff bid, must be
considered one of the four best
teams in the Pennsylvania-Dela-
ware-New Jersey area. Pitt moved
one step further from that chance
when its game at Bucknell,
perennial powerhouse, was rained
out and not rescheduled. pa

Now it will take a‘ superhuman
effort, an effort that must begin
with the Indians tonight. .

“We have to go on undefeated
and beat Penn State (the last home
game of the season) to go to the
NCAA’s,” Bemis conﬁrmed.

And going undefeated will be
rough, especially against Indiana.
Not only are the Indians 5-1-1,

In contrast, Pitt has scored eighty.

But on the brighter side, Pit_t’s .

statistics weren’t ‘as iinpressive as

Panthers defeated the Indians on

Can it happen again?

“Everyone I’ve talked to "says
they're a better team than last
year,” Bemis said. ,“They have a
lot of people back and have
aspirations of winning the Westefn

‘ Pennsylvania Soccer Conference ‘

_ this year. ’ ’ ‘

Which is entirely possible;-:

“He scares you every time he; _

too. Mark Nigh, Chris Connolly,

Panthers May Be Orange Bo wl Bound

, BY CRIS HALL

All week long, Panther coach
Johnny Majors and various assis-
tants have been on the lookout,
sometimes from high buildings and
armed with binoculars, "for Miam-
ians intent on learning more about
Pitt’s football team. Majors was
hoping to not ﬁnd any.

But tomorrow in Pitt Stadium’s
press box, two Miamians will watch
Pitt carefully and Majors will
supply them with binoculars, if the
occasion arises.

Committee, will view the Pitt-
Miami game, one of two Orange
Bowl games of the week. A
possible consequence for Pitt is a
million-dollar trip to Miami in late
Decmber.

“Pitt is not at the top of our list
right now,,but they’re close,” Nick
Crane, Orange Bowl Committee
team selection committee chair-
man, said yesterday.

“We spent the ﬁrst half of the
season seeing a lot of teams play,”
Crane said. “But from this point
on, we start to get serious.” The

other teams high on the commit-

tee’s list are Texas Tech, Mary-
land, Michigan and Ohio State.’
The other game the Orange Bowl
group will scout tomorrow involves
Maryland and ‘Wake Forest. The
Terrapins, undefeated and cur-
rently residing in the Top Ten,
would, like the Panthers, make a
good opponent for the Big Eight
champion, whose spot in the
Orange Bowl is already secured.
“Pittsburgh has a lot of things
going for it,” Crane said. “Tony

he wins the Heisman, and

  Netters “Brew” Rock  

BY JIM GEFSKY

Just like a can of Michelob, the

‘Pantherette netters experienced an
unexpected pleasure. On Wednes- _

‘day, they took full advantage of a
rescheduled match with Slippery
Rock by. giving the Rockettes a‘
sound 4-2 whipping. V
The standout of the match was
Janet - DeCostro who shut out
Slippery Rock's Trish McCall, 6-0,

. 6-0. Maria Paris wasalso a decisive

winner as ~" she defeated Kim
Davenport», 6-1, 6-1. Nancy
-Ballistreri had a somewhat tougher
time with her opponent, Sherry
Young, earning her ﬁrst set, 6-4,
then breezing through her second,
6-0. -

Pitt’s only singles defeat was a
heartbreaker. Janice Irwin defeat-
ed the Rockette’s Lois Nelson, 6-2,

in the ﬁrst set,‘ and was leading, 5-3,.

in the second, when Nelson made a
startling comeback, winning four
straight games to take the second
set, and taking another 7-6 set for
the victory. ‘

Pitt’s doubles teams split their

’ matches as, "Jan Brownstein_ and I
Terry Lies won in straight sets, 6‘-2, _
7.-5: and Pam ‘ Bachman. f3-H51’

     

F

  
   

   

   
  

' Bachman and Frey won the ﬁrst set,

6-2, but, unfortunately, they could
never quite break through inpthe
second and ﬁnally lost, 4-6 and 1-6.

Coach Nancy Gordon ‘was again
very high on her team, especially
DeCostro. “Janet played excep-
tionally well and really couldn’t
have done any better,” she said.

 Paris also looked righton top of

things. .

“Jan Irwin was involved in -an
excellent match, and even though
she was defeated, she played

strong, steady tennis. I know it’s p

just a matter of time until she'll be
consistently on top.

“The doubles teams, especially
Terry and Jan ‘played ‘very well
together. In fact, the whole match‘

was top quality tennis, even though _ '

some of the scores weren't
indicative of the quality of play.
The netters’ next match is their
home opener, a tri-match with
Michigan State and, Lock \ Haven
State at Trees Courts'atQ‘9 a.m.
tomorrow. ,
Lock Haven has the Stopper (yes,

‘that’s’ their name) sisters, and

doubles match. Lock Haven was.

very colorful team.

‘‘If Pitt is number one on
‘pick’-em" day (Nov. 20, the ﬁrst
day bowls can award invitations). I
think Pitt would be the number-one
choice of all the bowls.” _

Crane said Pitt's chances for an
Orange Bowl bid would be greatly
enhanced by a Michigan loss. '

“Pittsburgh is number two right
now, and that’s very impressive,”
he said. “And Pitt is the premier
choice for most bowls‘ if Michigan
should lose, say, to Ohio State.”

Michigan is one of the other
teams high.on the Orange Bowl
list, presumably at the top, but the
Wolverines will play in the Rose
Bowl if they win the Big 10-crown.
If they don’t beat Ohio State and,
consequently, don’t ﬁnish first in
the Big 10, they also will not ﬁnish

‘ahead of an undefeated Pitt team in

the polls.
So, it seems, if Pitt can continue
to win, even by low scores (“I don’t

‘think a low score against Miami

would hurt them--only a loss,”
Crane said), they should end up

number one on the list, regardless
of what Michigan does.

The Orange Bowl will trail only
the Rose in terms of ﬁnancial
reward to the participants, assum-
ing all tickets to the Miami stadium
are sold.

“If we sell all our tickets,” Crane
said, “we will give approximately
$1 million to each team.
Considering that roughly $250,000
is spent on expenses for the game,
that leaves about $750,000 for
proﬁt and I'm sure any program
could‘ use that kind of money.”

Pitt also would get 12,500 tickets
for the game. The school's ability
to sell the tickets, along with the
uncertainty concerning the out-

.come of Pitt’s Nov. 26 date with

Penn State, are the major factors
that could work against Pitt on
“pick-em” day.

But those points would be
overlooked if Pitt continues to win,
because, as Crane said, “atthis
point,
there.”

DRIVING BLIND IN PITTSBURGH

PITTSBURGH (AP)—James
Pyczynski calls driving “the most
dangerous sport around,” but
yesterday he drove a hearse across a
bridge and down four city blocks in.
Pittsburgh traffic blindfolded.

It was’ no ordinary blindfold.
Pyczynski’ s eyes were shielded with
bread dough, a metal mask was
placed over his face and a hood
covered his head. ,

‘Just in case someone wasn't
impressed, he piloted the aging
Cadillac funeral wagon through a

human obstacle course on the city’s

North Side with the blinders still on.
“You do this kind of thing very
carefully, ’ ’ he saidwith a dry humor
that probably comes with the
profession. ' ’_ ’ 
Pyczynski is a daredevil illusion-
ist. ,He "likes, to‘ be_ called "Loyal

His driving demonstration was a
publicity stunt for a Pittsburgh
March of Dimes haunted house
project which annually raises
almost $50,000 to ﬁnance research
on birth defects.

Last year Loyal James promoted
the project——and himse1f—with a
dramatic escape from a straitjacket
while dangling from a crane 200 feet
above Pittsburgh’s Gateway Cen-
ter.

He also broke the world record for
sleeping on a bed of nails, staying
on a porcupine palate for 26 hour
and 37 minutes: '

SWINE FLU SHOTS
WILL RESUME

PITTSBURGH (AP)—Swine
ﬂu innocolatins for elderly persons
will resume Monday in Allegheny
County, where the deaths of three
persons this week triggered tem-
porary cancellation of the program
in several states.

the vaccination of persons under
65 will begin as scheduled Sunday.

“The official explanation is the
three deaths were a coincidence,”
said Dr. Frank Clack, director of the
Allegheny County Health Depart-
ment, at a press conference
yesterday.

Clack said further tests would be
conducted because “it is hard to
accept the coincidence.

‘ ‘I’d feel better if we had another
explanation,”'he said. _

Health officials said the three
Pittsburgh deaths were a result of
natural ‘causes.

‘ ‘They would have died anyway,-’ ’
said Dr. Ray L. Titchworth,
chairman of the county health
board. He said all three had. had
chronic heart problems and two

for their shots.

When the program for highriskv
persons resumes, procedures will
be implemented to reduce stress,
which health officials believe ‘may
have contributed to the deaths.

“People waited in line’ longer
than they should have,” said
Titchworth. .

He said the countylhas sufﬁcient
supplies of swine ﬂu and A-Victoria
ﬂu vaccine and there is no reason for
senior citizens to crowd clinics to be
innoculated.

BUTZ GIVEN WARM
HoMEcoMING

FOWLER, Ind. (AP)—Wil1
Erwin worried almost to the last
minute about how to introduce his
old boss, Earl Butz. “Earl,” he said
when the moment was at hand, “I
want to welcome you back to
Indiana. Here they value people for
what they do, not what they say.’’’

Earl L. Butz, still the “Dean” to
the country folk of northwestern
Indiana, had returned——not in
disgrace for the obscene racial slur

that forced his resignation as -

secretary of agriculture—but as a
hero who sacriﬁced himself for the
good of his Republican party.

The occasion officially was a
$10-a-couple fund-raising dinner
for Erwin, Butz’ former assistant
agriculture secretary and now,
Republican nominee for "Congress
in Indiana’s 2nd District.

‘ But in reality, it was a
homecoming for Butz.

“We’re not kidding ourselves.
We know who's responsible for all
these people being here,” Benton
County Republican Chairman John
Barce said as he looked at the
sellout crowd of 800 at Benton
Central High School.

They were Butz’ type of '
people—the kind, Barce said, “who
havepretty hands, but not beautiful
hands; hands that show hard
work.” Their’ work also showed, he
said with a certain home pride, in
the surrounding ﬁelds, with bounti-
ful crops now being harvested.
