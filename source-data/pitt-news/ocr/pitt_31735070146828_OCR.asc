Students turn their heads down in distress as they watch the Miami Hurricanes defeat Pitt 31-3 at Heinz Field last night.

Marissa Meredyth
Staff Writer

While some students watched
Pitt play Miami last night, others
gathered for a lecture on the global
economics of oil prices.

The lecture, titled, “The Vega
Factor: Oil Volatility and Global
Conflict,” is the ﬁrst in a three—part
lecture series that focuses on water,
energy and conﬂict.

The goal of the series is to in-
crease local awareness on a wide
range of international issues, said
Veronica Dristas, outreach co-
ordinator for the Global Studies
Program of Pitt’s Center for Inter-
national Studies.

Kent Moors, a political science
professor at Duquesne University,
spoke at last night’s event.

An internationally recognized
expert for his work in oil and natu-
ral gas policy, Moors has been an
adviser for the American, Russian,
Kazakh, Bahamian, Iraqi and Kurd-
ish governments.

In the small gathering of attend-
ees was RaihanaA1 Nahari, a global
management student in Pitt’s Col-
lege of Business Administration.

The Pitt junior said it was in-
teresting to hear Moors talk about
how Saudi Arabia does not report
its oil reserve numbers.

Al Nahari, a citizen of the United

_ Arab Emirates, said she was curi-

ous to see if the UAE reported its

oil reserve numbers. '

Moors said that not having an

official report of Saudi Arabia’s oil
reserves makes ﬁnding the real
value of a barrel of oil extremely
difﬁcult.

“It’s the future contracts and
options — the paper, not the true
value 4 that is determining the
prices we pay,” Moors said. “That’s
what we call a bubble.”

According to Moors, oil prices
don’t come from the cost of a barrel
of oil. Investors essentially place
bets on what oil will cost in the
future, which can allow the price

to rise above the actual value of V

the oil. ,
The Global Solutions Education
Fund Pittsburgh and Pitt’s Global

  Lecture on oil market at Pitt

Studies Center, Center for Russian
and East European Studies and In-
ternational Business Center spon-
sored the event in the William Pitt

Union as part of Pi ’s International '

Week. ‘

The Global Solutions Educa-
tion Fund and the Global Studies
Center launched the Global Is-
sues Lecture Series in the spring
of 2002. The next lecture will take
place on Oct. 19, although no other

information regarding a topic has .

been issued.

“[The International Business
Center] and the Global Stud-
ies Center collaborates on many
events together since one of focus
themes is the global economy,”

31-3 at

To say that Pitt’s offense struggled to
moVetheballlastnightagainstMiami
would be an understatement;

In fact, in the Panthers’ (1-2) 31-3
loss to the No. 19 Hurricanes (2-1) at
Heinz Field, the offense didn’t even
pick up a ﬁrst down until Ray Graham
moved the chains with 5:59 left in the
second quarter.

‘We are one good play on olfense
rightnowandtwobadpIays,”Wannst-
edt said. “We’re not consistently doing
anything: throwing the ball, catching
the ball, blockingorrunning, Right now
we’re very inconsistent on offense.”

Theoffense onlymanaged138yards
through three quarters, as opposed to
Miami’s 276. Quarter_backTino Sunseri
went8for15with 61yards beforebeing
knocked out ofthe gamewithahead
injury in the third quarter. His backup,
PatBosu'ck, didn’tfare anybetter, going
5for9withtwo interceptions. _

“[Tino] got hit in the head, and he
told the trainers thathis visionwas not
right, so it was a medical decision,”
Wannstedt said.

Miamigotontheboardquicklyand

capped by a Damien Berry 1—yard run.

THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID

’ aitlyn Christensen
Columnist

My literature professor asked us to
write down three  that would
bringhappiness. One of rnyclassmates
wrote “love.” I had thought about put-
ting it down myself but wrote a short
list of material items instead. Love is
cliché.

Upon hearing love, however, my
professor, Uma Satyavolu, threw out
her arms in excitement. “Why, of
course!”

She went on to say that she had
taugl1t courses in Shakespeare, and
students shifted uncomfortablyintheir
seats when confronted with sonnets.

“It took me a long time to under-
stand adolescentlove,” Satyavolu said.
“Why, if someone says, ‘I am deeply,

Nobody woos anybody anymore,
notreally. If they do, it’s with latenight
texts and mixed messages. Ifsomeone
writes a love poem, she isn’t going to
share it. Ifsomeone really is inlove, he
won’t say it first I

Yet taken at face value, our reluc-
tance doesn’tseemto make sense. Fall-

ing in love should be easier than ever
before.’InAmerica, arranged marriages
are obsolete.-Wecanbe with the person
we really want to be with, regardless of
money or caste. We don’t even have to

get married if we don’t want to. Birth

_ can often have sex without becom-

ing sick or pregnant. Homosexuality
is more acceptable than in centuries
prior. V

In literature, characters onlyfall in

love when there is an obstacle — “Ro- _

meo andjuliet” isthe easiest and most
obvious example. And in the greatest

slept, who her favorite painter ms or
even her middle name.

Had it happened today,_ Dante
could have snagged Beatrice’s digits
inaheartbeat, andthatpartofthe story

- wouldbe over. There muststillbe some
sort of obstacle, Ithought. Ifthere isn’t
an obstacle, how is romance going to
survive? . V ..

Maybe love isn’t going to last for
long. Because it’s easier, we have the

opportunity to know too much about

it. We can date earlier, so many of us
know premarital sex —' there’s no
mystery there. We’ve been broken up
with, fooled aroundwith and stalkedby
overly sentimental exes. We’ve tasted
every type of ﬁuit, and it’s makingus
nauseous. A
Unwilling to believe that love is
on its way out, I stayed after class to
talk to Satyavolu. I asked her whether
there are obstacles now — challenges

ticswereaddailyinthemedia—that
one intwo marriages end in divorce, for
example. Orthat 51 percent ofwomen
are single, as The New York Times

reported in 2oo7..E.\/en if the reports

are inaccurate, even if not everyone

is getting divorced or dying alone, we '

still know that love is, above all else,
risky and irnpermanent. We’ve expe-
rienced the risk and irnperrnanence
for ourselves. " -
“Andallthose experiences makeus
cynical,” Satyavolu continued. “Which
is the greatest obstacle to overcome.
People havethis ideathat romantic love
isfor everyone.Thisisnottrue. Butthe
people who overcome their cynicism
are more likely to ﬁnd true romantic
love,to openthemselves uptotl1epos—

“Love is altruistic,” Satyavolu said.
“It is sex and it is companionship, but

thing because it also involves giving
more of yourselfthan you can ever
give to anyone else, more than you
can give to a friend or your parents or

“Love gives us the chance to.go

itt to hold job fair in, the Pete

Brody Engelhard
For The Pitt News

So now that Part One of the plan
— getting into college - is done,
it’s now time for Part Two — get-
ting a job. A

Despite the recession and the
rumors surrounding the current
job market, getting a job may not
be as impossible as it seems.

There are people, places and
events here to help. Pitt counselors
say the very ﬁrst thing you need to
consider when starting down the
job trail, is the Fall Career Fair at
the Petersen Events Center this
coming Thursday.

Before you start to think, “Oh,

-the Career  That isn’t for me,”

and turn the page, reconsider by
coming to understand the com-
mon misconceptions about the
Career Fair as well as some tips
given to us by workers in the Ca-
reer Development Office and the
Ofﬁce of Student Employment and

Placement Assistance.

1. “The fair is just for Business
or Marketing majors.” This com-
mon belief is utterly and complete-
ly false.’ Any major can ﬁnd appli-
cable areas at the Career Fair.

2. “Only seniors and juniors
need apply.” No matter what year
you are in school, counselors say

‘you should. go. The fair isn’t just

for seniors or juniors. The fair of-
fers access to alumni and graduate
schools and offers a great opportu-
nity to network — one of the most
important aspects of your life after
college. This year’s Career Fair will
have a networking area speciﬁcally
designed for those not currently
looking for jobs. _

3. “There is nothing there for
me.” Just because your career goals
don’t apply to the businesses at-the
fair doesn’t mean you shouldn’t

g0. Open yOl1I'- eyes t0 more pOS-.

sibilities and increased exposure
to the real world that awaits you
after college. .

4. “I am not looking for a job,

- why should I go?” The Career Fair

is for more than just people look-
ing for a job. In addition to these
factors, the Career Fair is also a
true reﬂection of the job market
today, and students with_a major
but without a career path in mind
should attend the Fair. You can

learn what your major has to offer '

in terms of the marketplace and
paths for you to follow.

So now you’ve decided to go to
the Career Fair — a wise choice.
But wait, now what? You can’t walk
in unprepared and empty-handed.
Here are some steps and tips you
can use in order to prepare for the

Career Fair.
The Career Development Of—-

ﬁce, located at 224 William Pitt
Union, should be your ﬁrst stop.
The CD0 offers career counseling,

. resurné critiquing and interview-

ing practice sessions. They have
walk—in advising, advising by ap-
pointment and even a plethora of
online options at their website
(careers'.pitt.edu) that include

electronic resumé reviews and
online chats.

After your time at the CD0 you
can head down the hall to 200 Wil-
liam Pitt Unionand into the Ofﬁce
of Student Employment and Place-
ment Assistance, better known
as SEPA. A

Next, you should start doing
your homework. SEPA posts a list
of all the companies that are going
to be at the fair on their website
(hire.pitt.edu) in advance. Find
out what companies you plan on
visiting, and look into ones that
sound interesting and learn what

they do. Knowledge about your‘

potential employer will not only
impress them in interviews, it will
help you decide what employers
are best for you.

After you’ve done the research,
made a list and possibly checked
it twice, it’s time to print out that
resumé you had checked. Print out
enough to cover all the companies
you are potentially interested in,
and then print a bunch more. It’s

never a bad idea to have more re-
sumés than you need.

Now it’s time to prep your
clothes. Yes, how you dress is im-
portant. By having your clothes
ready a night or two beforehand,
you’ll avoid last-second wardrobe
malfunctions. Recommended
dress is business attire for all se-
niors and business casual for all
others. - _
Finally, it’s time to prepare a
30-second introduction. As As-

sociate Director of the Career De-
. velopment Office Barbara Julius-

sen put it, .“When you go up to an
employer at the job fair, you want
to be the ﬁrst to speak,-‘You want
to extend your hand, look them
in the eye, smile and introduce
yourself and give them informa-
tion about you.” ,
When you introduce yourself,
you should include information
such as your year, major, areas of
interest, skills and experiences in
related areas. This will, help em-
ployers remember who you are

Some internships can turn into jobs  

Olivia Garber
Assistant News Editor

Any employment guide will tell you
that internships can help get jobs.
But for some Pitt students, intern-
ships can become jobs.

A recent study by the Wall Street
Journal said that nearly a quarter
of college recruiters ﬁlled about

50 percent of their job openings '

with students who had previously
interned at their company. This
trend has also been making some
headway at Pitt.

Jeffrey Whitehead was an in-
tern in the Study Abroad Office
before he was hired to work -there
full time. He’s currently its interim
director.

“Having the knowledge of how
[the] office operated certainly
helped [me] in [my] endeavor to
secure full—time employment,” he
said in an e—mail.

Cheryl Finlay, director of the
Office of Student Employment and
Placement Assistance, said in an
e—mail that having an internship

can be a major factor in a student’s
ability to secure a full-time posi-
tion in the company.

Caren Marcus, the writing
internship coordinator for the
English department, agreed, al-
beit cautiously. She said students
can get a job after completing an
internship, but “the stars have to
fall in the right place.”

Angela Radack, a senior at Pitt
and intern at KDKA, isn’t count-
ing on it.

“If they would offer me a job,
that would be great —_ but I’m not
banking on it,” she said.

Some students and administra-
tors say that while an internship
isn’t, a direct shoo-in for a job, it
can be a way for students to get
their foot in the door.

Ben Pilcher, who works in the
Study Abroad Office, has experi-
enced this ﬁrsthand. A

Pilcher, who interned at the
Study Abroad Office in the fall of
2005, started working there after
he graduated in 2006.

But he was careful to say that
the internship wasn’t the deciding

factor for getting the job.

“The big reason I work here
now is because a job happened to
open up,” he said.

Marcus adds that getting a job
post—intemship isn’t a given.

“Often it_has nothing to do with
the person. If there’s not an open-
ing, there’s nothing for them,” she
said. ’

Pilcher applied to morethan 50
study-abroad positionsand was
planning on accepting a position
at a different place when a spot

‘opened at Pitt. He said he had to

go through all the steps of applying
and interviewing for the vacancy.

Though his familiarity with
the interviewer made the process

more comfortable, Pilcher said it .

was all “very professional.”

Pitt’s annual Post—Graduation
Status Report said that 23 percent
of students from the class of 2009
who reported that they were em-
ployed after graduation cited a
previous internship as being the
most beneﬁcial factor leading to
their current position.

Radack said that although she’s

' The Pittsburgh area has followed the trend.
Duquesne, Carnegie Mellon and Pitt all report-

from 2005 to 2009, the University saw a 20

ROTC provides job stability, ﬁnancial   perks  

John Manganero
Assistant News Editor

Unlike many’ Pitt juniors, Hannah
Baker knows exactly what she’ll be
doing after graduation next year —
and it won’t involve scouring the
classiﬁeds.

Instead, Baker will oversee 40
fully trained and equipped U.S.
Army soldiers, plan their day—to—
day activities and possibly even lead
them into combat while monitoring
millions of dollars worth of high-
tech equipment._

In her future position, she’ll re-
ceive full health-care benefits for
herself and any dependents she
might claim. And she won’t have

any school loans to pay back.

Those prospects are partially
what drove Baker to join Pitt’s
chapter of the,Greater Pittsburgh
Army ROTC. When she completes
the ROTC program, Baker will enter
the military with the rank of second
lieutenant.

And although the additional

training and course work demanded
by the ROTC curriculum occasion-
ally eats into her free time,_Baker
and her fellow cadets enjoy a mea-
sure of job security that some other
Pitt students can only envy.

“The extra workouts and meet-
ings can deﬁnitely put a strain on
your schedule, but it helps ‘me to
have that kind of structure,” Baker
said last week in Belleﬁeld Hall,
home of Pitt’s ROTC program. “I
feel like I have less time,‘butI get

‘more done. And I know exactly

where I’m going.”
Like all students enrolled in
the ROTC program, Baker signed
a binding agreement with the U.S.
government. In exchange for four
years of active service, cadets re-
ceive ﬁill tuition and fees payment,
as well as a $600—per-semester
book stipend and a monthly liv-
ing allowance between $300 and '
$600. ’
Those perks don’t come free,
though. While at Pitt, cadets attend
four morningphysical-training ses- V
sions and one leadership workshop

_ “Leadersh1p

each week. _,

The major perk, Baker said, is
job security and entry wages ex-
ceeding $45,000 annually.

“I’ve had a job lined up since I

came in,” Baker said. “It’s deﬁnitely

comforting to know tha .”

From the outside, the ROTC of-
ﬁce is marked only by afew modest,
black-and-gold insignias reading

' ” and “Excellence” and
“Three Rivers Battalion.” Inside, the
office is spacious and well lit, with
six or seven wrap—around desks and
a conference room to one side.

In the ofﬁce, Baker’s command-
ing ofﬁcer described the major pros
and cons of joining the ROTC pro-
gram. He said that while many stu-
dents are drawn by the prospect of

» -full tuition payment, book stipends

and a guaranteedj ob, the program
isn’t for everyone.

“It’s not a free ride through
school, that’s for sure,” Three Riv-
ers Battalion executive officer Maj.
Todd Looney said. “But at the same
time, our cadets come out of school
with a sterling resume, and they

The best timesto apply vary

Estelle Tran
Senior Staff Writer

Housemates Sophie Rowen and Anne Wallace
worked on homework and casually checked
Facebook at neighboring computers in Hillman
Library on a quiet Monday night.

The pair of seniors — like many others at
Pitt — haven’t started applying for j obs yet.

Luckily for them, time is still on their side.
Théy’ve been preparing for careers for more
thanthree years, but now that they are prepar-
ing to leave the Pitt community for a spot inthe
“real world,” timing the application process
is key. V

Freshman through junior year

Cheryl Finlay, director of the Ofﬁce of Stu-
dent Employment and Placement Assistance,
said that the job search starts as early as fresh-
man year. Students should research potential
jobs and employers, network with teachers and
reach out to professionals for job shadowing
opportunities. »

Finlay encourages underclassmen to check_
out-the Career Fair because employers might
be looking for interns as well.

Mark Simon, UPMC’s manager of talent
acquisition, said UPMC posts new job and in-
ternship openings at more than 400 physician
practices, hospitals and ofﬁces regularly on
its website. 5

‘ Though Pitt students don’t have a golden
ticket to a job atVUPMC, they’ll be more com-
petitive if they’ve interned with the company.
Simonisaid internship programs like the sum-
mer associate program help him identify talent.
His department, human resources, has hired
several former summer associates for full—time
positions. ’

Septemberand October of senioriyear

Students should take care to prepare a re-
sume and letters of recommendation that they
are ready to send out quickly. Finlay stressed
the importance of researching employers so
that students can go into the Career Fair this
coming Thursday knowing who they want to
meet. _

- “_It’s a really good opportunity for students
to do some comparative shopping,” Finlay
said.- “I think you need to be open in your pur-
sui .” .

More than 40 of the about 200 companies
and employers at the Fall CareerFairwill inter-
view applicants in the William Pitt Union the
next day. Fifty-eight graduate schools and law
schools are also projected to attend.

After going to the Career Fair and meet-
ing recruiters, Finlay suggests contacting the
recruiter and thanking them for the informa-
tion within a few days. Recruiters travel from
career fair to career fair and forget students’
names among all of the handshakes and smiles.
Students can stand out by mentioning a spe-

ciﬁc question they brought up, somethingthey

discussed oreven what they wore.

During Homecoming weekend, SEPA puts
on a Pathway to Professions event, whichwill
be held on Oct. 28, to help students network
with alumni from around the country. SEPA
targets young professionals who will be helpful
during the hiring process. C

Finlay said in a follow-up email that more
than 19 percent of students found their jobs
through career fairs, on-campus interviews, the
FutureLinks system and networking events.

The Career Fair isn’t the only option, but it’s
a good way to get students thinking seriously
about applying for jobs, Finlay said. SEPA sur-
veyed students last year about how they were
employed. Twenty-three percent reported that
a previous internship helped. Sixteen percent
found their jobs through networking, 15 per-
cent contacted their employers directly and
14 percent found their jobs through Internet

job listings.

H No need to panic

Forthose who are graduating in December
or feel compelled to hang on to this article into
the spring, fear not.

“Just be up front with folks and the recruit-
er,” Simon said. b

He added that students should be as speciﬁc
as possible in their applications and not submit
resumes blindly. C

For UPMC, the recruitment cycle takes be-
tween six and eight weeks. There are general
hiringseasons, Simon said, but students should
apply for jobs as soon as they appear online.

“In terms of our ﬁscal year (July to June),

sometimes we wait to hire new positions until _

we better understand our ﬁnancial states. So
sometimes you see our summer months are
busy for us speciﬁcally,” he said.

Afterjune, different departments often start
hiring people when they know how much they
can allot for projects. .

Rowen and Wallace plan to apply for jobs

when they come back from winter break this I

year. Though many application deadlines would
have already passed, they have researched
many of the jobs they’re considering. Rowen,
a communication and psychology major, has

been looking for year—long internships with ,

sports teams. What team she’ll be.cheering
for, she isn’t sure. ' '

“I think it’s tough because we don’t know
where we want to live yet,” Rowen said.

Rowen and Wallace went to the same high
school in Lancaster County. .

THE MOUSTACHE COLUMN

Unisex corduroy capris pique yourfancy?.Get a job

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

 

 

College is an expensive proposition.
In the days of yore, everything cost a
lot less than it does now. You could
get by on a smile and the occasional
sawbuck from theparents. We at the
Moustache Club of America remem-
ber when draft beers were a nickel,
hamburgers were so cheap that
McDonald’s was giving them away,
Tamagotchi feverwas sweeping the
nation and nobody had ever heard
of iPods or American Apparel and its
unisex corduroy capri pants.
However, 1998 is atdistant mem-
ory — the dot—com bubble has burst
and things don't look very promising
for modern’ students. There are so
many more things to buy, including
iPods and American Apparel unisex
corduroy capri pants, and we have
so little money with which to buy

' them. One of the solutions to having

no money is to_ get a part-time job,

and lots of us have hopped on_ that .

bandwagon.
A According to some website, part-

time jobs date back to the Paleolithic

Age. Back then, college students who
needed the 0ld—Stone-Age equiva-
lent of iPods and American Apparel
unisex corduroy capri pants took
part—time jobs feeding dinosaurs,

washing mammoths, neutering ‘

saber—toothed tigers and the like.

’ These jobs were pretty mindless
and often quite dangerous, but an-
cient college students justiﬁed‘ this
to themselves by noting that their
employment would be temporary.
They were just hanging on until they
could accomplish bigger and more
impressive things, like discoveringa
new kind of edible berry or becom-
ing the shaman of their tribe.

Nowadays, we students have a

., host of less dangerous but certainly

no less mindless options for part-
time employment. One of the top

options is a position in the fast—food '

industry. By choosing to workat a

. fast—food restaurant, we can watch '
A our Economics 101 textbooks come

capable truthaof the invisible hand
like burning your real hand inside

Another thing you can learn at
a fast—food restaurant is what goes

into the fast food. You might have
gone throughlife thinking that
those delicious breakfast sand-
wiches were made from stardust
and dreams, but you’ll soon learn
that you were dead wrong: They are
actually constructed using a secret
combination of powdered egg sub-
stitute, processed cheese product

swiping a student _ID card or record-
ing a few names on a chart.

In our opinion, these are the ,

best jobs you will ever have, and if

you ﬁnd yourself forced to choose ‘

As early as next spring, this steel—built city
will replace its old foundations with silicon as
Google expands into a40,000—square-foot of-

' ﬁce in Pittsburgh’s Bakery Square development,

according to the Pittsburgh Tribune—Review.
The company officially opened it’s Pitts-
burgh ofﬁce at Carnegie Mellon in 2006 with
two employees. It now employs more than 100
people and is growing. The expansion of the
multinational corporation faces us with the
question: How is Pittsburgh’s economy going

— to change?

Google came to Pittsburgh because we are
home to some of the best computer scientists
and engineers in the United’ States. In the US
News & World Report list of best universities
for engineering and IT, CMU ranked 12th in

  Goog e, get prosperity

openings are already posted for positions in
software engineering and engineering opera-
tions at the Bakery Square ofﬁce. According
to the Tribune-Review, about half of Google’s
current Pittsburgh employees are graduates of
local universities. The company says it plans to
maintain its current ratio with the expansion.

It is also widening its applicant pool to include
applicants specializing in biology, business
and artiﬁcial intelligence. If the students stay,

Pittsburgh could become one of America’s great
cities. .

But merely tapping into existing talent is not
enough — in order for Google to be successful
in Pittsburgh, it must also tap into the city’s
existing personality. The common conception
is that people love Pittsburgh for Primanti Bros.
sandwiches, the Penguins and the Steelers, but
it’s more than that. Pittsburgh is unique for its
quirky neighborhoods, the Saturday-moming
Strip District and its underground music scene

 

the world this year. The Google ofﬁce’s close
proximity to CMU offers the opportunity for
close collaboration with experts in the ﬁelds
of Machine Learning, Computer Systems and
Robotics. -

The corporation’s local expansion means
that we can expect morelof those university
graduates to remain in the city after gradua-
tion, instead of moving to technical hubs like
the Silicon Valley. Although Forbes Magazine
ranked Pittsburgh atop‘-10 cityinterms of2009
job growth, many IT graduates still choose to
leave. A 2009 survey of CMU electrical and
computer-engineering graduates found that

A a whopping 24 percent moved to California,

Hawaii or Nevada to ﬁnd work after gradua-
tion. Forty-nine percent remained in the mid-
Atlantic region.

For the most part, it can be assumed that
graduates are not leaving by choice. The city
has one of the largest student populations inthe
country. The cost of living is fairly affordable

- and the city offers awealth of museums, concert

halls, parks, bars and restaurants —- prime
components to intrigue a young professional
population. Students leave because the majority.
of Pittsburgh’s economy is based on medical
research and pharmaceuticals. For those _not
going to medical school, job opportunities are
more restricted. M
Google could change this exodus of elec-
trical- and computer-engineering graduates
and provide the kick—start needed for the city
to embrace its youthful population. The web
company’s expansion provides the promise
of forging stronger ties between the city and

the talents emerging from its universities.Job ”

and concert halls.

The company seemed to do just that — tap _

into local culture — in Boston, where it recently
expanded intoa satellite oﬂice. Although Google

I brought parts of Silicon Valley’s aesthetics when

it arrived in the city, it didn’t attempt to make
Boston an exact reproduction. The Cambridge
office uses facilities that include a house band,
Tiki-jungle-decorated workshops and mini-
kitchens within 150 feet of every employee;
But the ofﬁce also had local touches, such as
murals of Fenway Park, the Boston skyline and
local beers. It also showed movies ﬁlmed in
Massachusetts.

The CMU ofﬁce imitates Google’s corporate
ofﬁces in Californiawith bean bag chairs, apool
table and a real-time screen displaying Google
searches around the world. Perhaps the Bakery
Square office will work harder to incorporate
Pittsburgh aesthetics into the company’s Sili-
con model. .

So a city founded on steel mills and industry
has a new tenant anchoring a transient popula-
tion.'If Pittsburgh’s best computer research-
ers and engineers stay in the city, the change
promises to start a chain reaction, attracting
more researchers, more jobs and more op-
portunity. When choosing where they want to
work, professors are attracted by the_ quality of
their co—workers and faculty members. All job
markets operate in much the same way. Google
will help provide potentialfor the city to bloom
and grow, in a continuation of the economic
revamping we’ve seen with the medical and
pharmaceutical ﬁrms. If more I'I‘ companies
follow Google here, the next few years are going
to be exciting ones for our city.

In today’s job searches, networking is key

Natalie Bell
-A8‘ E Editor

More often than you’d like, getting a
job is aboutwho you know. Sometimes,
you know the rightpeoplewithout even
realizing it.
Danielle Scott, networking coor-
_dinator in the Office of Student Em-
ployment and Placement Assistance,
helpedtwo Pittalurrmi——onewhowas
lookingforajob and onewhowaslook—
ing for an applicant — get in touch.
A Pitt alumnus had called her in
search of a gregarious applicant for a
job at State Farm Insurance. A week
later, another Pitt alumnus contacted
Career Services aboutlﬁnding a new
job. Scott had passed the State Farm
Insurance request around the ofﬁce
‘ and a career counselorwas able to put
the two alumni together to schedule
anintervievv. .
Scottistaskedwithgettingintouch
/with employers to help Pitt affiliates
ﬁnd jobs, especially by contacting Pitt
alumni with the Pitt Career Network,
the database she’sworked onthatlists
Pitt alumni. Scott offers students tips
on howtheycanuse the database suc-
cessﬁ1lly..
“I think e-mail is the best way —_

send e-mail, [or] if there’s a number
listed, call,” she said.

You never knowwho might end up
helping you ﬁnd your perfect job. Pitt
hosts seminars on crafting resumes
and interview tactics, but sometimes
we forget that networking is one of
the mostbasic and important skills for
venturing out into the work world.

“It’s amazingthe connections that
canhappen  and that’s what network-
ingis about,” said Cheryl Finlay, direc-
tor of the Office of Student Employ-'
ment and Placement Assistance.

Finlay said that evenﬁrst year stu-
dents can start networking. New stu-

I dents should make a point to connect

with their professors and advisers, get
to know other students and join clubs
and sororities orfraternities. Network-
ing early means practicing so you can
really shine by the end of college.

“You want to separate yourself
and you want to make yourself vis-
ible,” Finlay said. She explained that
some sources claimthe numberofjobs
landed through networking is as high
as 70 percent. With numbers of that
magnitude, it appears we should spend
as muchtime building relationships as
perfecting our resumés. And Finlay
said that effort starts before you’ve
even met a potential employer.

“Ithinkit’s importantforstiidents getting to know the person they’re

to get online [to look at the Fall Career
Fair directory] and do their strategyfor
who to approac ,” she said.

She also said that for her and for
many professionals she knows,seek-
ing someone out is the kind of extra
work they notice and appreciate.

“That goes a long way, it really’

doesj’ she said. ,
Tom Baker, amotivational speaker

and vice president of production for‘

children mentoringservice BigBroth-
ers Big Sisters of Greater Pittsburgh,
agreed. He said that students who
contact him by e-mail after speeches
—— even when they weren’t able to
speak with him directly — stand out

' for taking the extra step.

But students must continue to
make a lasting impression on aﬁiture
employer alter they send that ﬁrst e-
mailor exchange thatﬁrst handshake.
Networking, after all, is not just con-
necting with another person — it’s
makingsure they remember you.

, “It comes off a little bit disingenu-
ous when a student comes over and
they’re a little robotic about it and it’s
obvious they’re just networking to
network ... it doesn’t make you feel
speci ” he said. _

. Instead, students should focus on

speaking to. Baker mentioned that
when people come over andtalkabout
knowing his wife or engage him in a
conversation about one ofhis favorite
hobbies, such as sports, he feels more
at ease withthem. '

“It’s all about just being able to put
yourself out there. It doesn’t have to
be inaprofessional setting, just giving
off a professional, friendly vibe that’s
important,” he said. A

Anotherthingto remember: Even
though you’re there to impress em-
ployers with all your activities and ac-
colades, sometimes it’s better to ask
about the other person instead oftalk—
ingabout how great you are. ‘ ‘

“I think it’s really important not to

focus as much on yourselfin the con-_
versation as much as [on] the person

who works at the company you want
to work for  People like telling their
story,” Baker said.

And when you are talking about
yourself, Baker stressed how impor-
tant it is to justbe yourself, quirks and
all. Sometimes it’s those little tidbits —
like your involvement in a city sports
league — that people remember.

“To be honesttoo, I getto speakall
over the country. I’m a motivational
speaker, and sometimes even I’m alitftle

 people ofremember
that kind’ of thing,” Baker said.

~ Finally, and most importantly, after
you connectwithapotential employer,
follow up. Even if it’s just an e-mail to
tell them you enjoyed speaking with
them, itcangoa1ongway.~Bakerrecalls
an applicant who, after her interview,
wentto her car and wrote out athank
you note, bringingitback immediately.
He found her attention to detail im-
pressive and it cemented his decision
to hire her.

“Ifnothing else  ifsmdents start
doing stuff— makingsuretheyfollow
up  the faster, the better,” he said. ’

~ If all this still seems a bit intimi-
dating, Pitt is here to help. On Oct.
28, Career Services‘ will host Pathway
to Profession, its armual networking

event, where Baker will be a guest’

speaker.

‘.‘We understand networkingseems
scary. We try to ease that with this
event,” Scott said.

But remember: Though network-
ingcango alongwayinmakingbig
things happen, it doesn’t have to be

“It’s importantto notalwaysbesell-

For some grads, the
first job is overseas

Merritt Wuchina
‘ Sta_ﬁ'Wr_iter

To many graduates, it seems like there are only
three options after college: get a job, go to grad
school or go live with mom and dad.

_ Rather than accept the status quo, though,
some Pitt alumni have chosen to go abroad
and give back to the international community
through organizations like the Peace Corps and
WorldTeach.

ForPitt alumna Carrie Pavlik,joiningthe Peace
Corps wasn’t just any post-grad job.

“The Peace Corps is not about a career — it’s
about your life,” she said. -

Pavlikmajoredincommunications and studio
artand studied andvolunteered abroadinKings
ton,]amaica, duringherjunioryear. She decidedto
applyforthe Peace Co1psin2005 atthe beginning
of her senior year, leaving for Zambia in 2007.

But just because the Peace Corps isn’t your
“typical job” doesn’t meanthe applicationprocess
and time commitments are any easier.

“The application process is long ——' there are
essays, a background check and medical dear-
ances—-' and canlastanywherefromafew months
to ayear depending onwhenprograms openup,”
she said. ‘$0. typical Peace Corps service is26 to27
months  ’I‘here’s aprettyhigh dropout rate, butI
was abletostaythe entire 27months without even
cominghometovisit.” ' ‘ I I

Peace Corps volunteers canwork almost any-
where in the world, but can only select regional
preferences and not choose aparticular country.

Pavlik said she put Africa as her ﬁrst choice I

because 'she.“wanted avery rural and rustic ex-
perience.” ‘ " ' ‘ "

In Zambia, she worked as a Rural Education a

Development volunteer; which involved training
teachers and developinga school library.
I AlthoughPeaoe Corpsvolunteersareassigned
onlyto one program area— suchas Agriculture,
Health or Food Security —lthey stilldo service
projects in various ﬁelds.
Despite someculturaldiﬁerences, Pavlikfound

herselfadaptingwell to life in Africa and was not - :

ready to come back to the United States alter her
service. '

“It’s hard to conceptualize that afew days ago
you were living in a hut in Africa and now you’re
not,” she said. “In a way, it seems like you never
even left the United States. It’s depressing.”

' Aﬁzertheir service, Peace Corps volunteers are
paid $7,425, beforetaxes,toassistwiththeirtransi-
tion backto the states.They migl1ta1sobe eligible

For those who aren’t prepared to make a
two—year commitment abroad, the program

WorldTeach offers itselfas an alternative to the
Peace Corps.

Unlike the Peace Corps, World'I‘each is not an
American govemmentorganizalionbutisinstead
ﬁmdedbythe governments ofhost countries and
fundraising by volunteers.

According to the WorldTeach website, a year
inEcuador costs approidmately $4,900, but that
amount of money should be seen as an afford-
able cost of abroad, rather than just a fee
to volunteer. A

_ Volunteers canalso choose exactlywhat coun-
my they would like to work in.

Pitt alumnus'I‘imLaquintano gtaduatedwitha
degreeinEnglish inthe springof2001 and imme-
diatelylefcforaWorldTeach prograininEcuador
in the fall. He spent 11 months teaching English
writing, conversation and literature to students.

LikePavlik, Laquintano also spenttime abroad
duringcollege. He tooktwo semesters of Spanish
at Pitt and studied abroad in London. a

Still, hehadsome diﬁiculty adaptingto anew
environment. . .

“Forme, adaptingphysicallywas more dilﬁcult
than mentally,” he said. “I was ill constantly for
the ﬁrst threeweeks while adjustingto the food,
and I hadto leamto live at 8,000 feet[above sea
level] ...Ialso managedto teach aweek’sworth of
class with four different kinds of parasites living
inmy stoma ” -

Despite the toll onhishealth, he felthis experi-
ences abroadwere worthwhile. . -

“I drank rum with my host father and his
friendsaswewatched Ecuador qualifyforitsﬁrst

A WorldCup,”hesaid.“Itraveledthrougl1tl1ejungle,

throughcloudforestsandinthe Galapagos Islands.
I climbed volcanoes.”

Laquintano said that in addition to offering 0
many" adventures, thevolunteeringwasalsoagreat
way to prepare for a career. He currently works V

as an assistant professor of English at Lafayette
College." " 
“Volunteering at a nonproﬁt is a good wayto
acquire lots of responsibility — and thus good
professional experience — immediately after
 ”he said. “Ifyouplan on goingto gradu-
ateschool, ayear awayfrom highereducationcan
provide some much-needed perspective.” .
Like many post-grads her age, Pavlik hasn’t
hadmuchluckﬁndingajob giventhe state ofthe
economy. Instead, she plans to eventually live on
aself-sustainingrural farm.‘ ‘

To current students who are considering»

volunteering abroad alter Pitt, she gives some
simple advice: “Don’t wonder or worry about
whether it’s the right thingfor your ‘career path.’
Ifyou’re going to let thosetypes of thoughts get

. in the way, then Peace Corps isn’t for you. Even if

you get sick, even if you quit after a month, even
if everything goes wrong—-you’ll neverregretit.

Pitt helps students prepare for careers

Brian Pope
Staﬁ‘ Writer

College is sometimes compared to a four-
year job interview, Every course and activ-
 ity are the questions to which the student
must answer by. excelling academically and
socially. Then, of course, there are the actual
interviews.

Usually undergraduates do not have to
worry about jobs and internships until after
they have declared their majors. But the.
increased competitiveness of the job mar-
et has changed things to the point where
new applicants are inquiring about ways in
which Pitt can prepare them for the daunt-
ing task, Pitt advisers said. Luckily, there
are a plethora of hands—on oﬂices offering
the necessary resources for interview and
resume prep and networking etiquette.
The Ofﬁce of Student Employment &
Placement Assistance, or SEPA, is the pri-
mary place students turn to for solutions.
It opened in late 2008 and already SEPA
has managed to ﬁll a critical niche in the
University of Pittsburgh’s network of student
aid organizations. ,_

‘Under director Cheryl Finlay, SEPA offers

r

I‘

events over the course of the year to give
students the chance to interact with local‘

a variety of programs and sponsors many '

businesses.Job fairs including information
on positions in nearly every ﬁeld are'dis-
persed throughout each semester. These also

‘ include an On— Campus Student Employment

fair to highlight the many opportunities
within the limits of the Pitt umbrella for
professional achievement. .

“Knowing that you have impacted the
lives of students in such a tangible way by
equipping them with the resources and ser-
vices to help them connect with an employer
and ultimately making their dreams a reality
is the most fulﬁlling aspect of the work that
we do,” Finlay said. I

Other such programs include the Fall
& Spring Career Kick-Offweeks and Fairs.

- They are akin to the orientation activities

for freshmen, but instead of instructing stu-
dents how to interact with their peers, these
meetings focus on prospective employee-
to-interviewer relations. Some workshops
are targeted more towards the students
at the graduate level and/or those of the
pre—professional schools or those with very
deﬁnite career goals, but they are open to
everyone.

The 2010 Fall Career Fair will happen in
the Petersen Events Center from 10 a.m. to
4 p.m. this coming’Thursday. The _event is
sponsored by many well-known companies
like American Eagle Outﬁtters and the PNC
Financial Services Group. It is with their help

that this fair will include a higher number
of employers and graduate and law schools
in attendance than last year.

SEPA also champions the cause of mak-
ing on—campus jobs accessible to everyone
enrolled at Pitt, regardless of whether they
qualify for federal Work Study. Positions
include anything from a consultant in the
campus computer labs to a receptionist in
the William Pitt Union. The FutureLinks

‘kiosks located around campus provide up-

to-date info on openings at on- and imme-
diately off—campus businesses.
The poor state of the economy, which has

- persisted of the past couple of years, has not

been able to slow or even signiﬁcantly alter
SEPA’s grand efforts. .

“Our office continues to build relation-
ships with recruiters representing a wide
variety of professions to give Pitt students
the best opportunity for career success,”
Finlay said.

She recognizes that students have to
work harder to get ahead in today’s world.
It is also necessary for them to apply to dif-
ferent employers that highlight any one of
their strengths because they no long have
the “luxury” of being ‘choosy.

Sophomore Morgan Donovan became
acquainted with the career service office
at Pitt in the process of applying for Work-
study. — '

lessly following a formula of etiquette. A

“I wish that my position prepared me
more for my bigger career goals, but I do
appreciate the experience in time manage-
ment and budgeting that this job gives [me] ,”
said Donovan, who works in the Religious
Studies office in the Cathedral of Learning
and is enrolled in the College of Business
Administration. ‘

The knowledge that members of the SEPA
ofﬁce have is something that they desire to
pass on to Pitt students. It is also true that
landing a job will not be as easy as mind-

nuanced sense of professionalism will hope-
fully bloom in time for that “big” interview.
Until then, the work starts in the classroom
and depends on every choice each student
makes. ’

Other resources available to students
include:

—Pitt’s Career Development Ofﬁce, on the
second ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union —
This ofﬁ_ce teaches students how to search
for jobs and internships and how to network.
It also offers resume and cover letter cri-
tiques and reviews personal statements.

-The Career Development Center atJew-
ish Family 8: Children’s Service of Pittsburgh,
in Squirrel Hill — This center offers work-
shops on resume writing and cover letter
writing and offers counseling. I

still adjusting to the extra work, the intern-
ship is worth it because she’s able to experi-
ence the real working world.

“I like going to an office in the morning
and [being] around working people,’.’ she
said.

‘ Being around working people can reveal
an intem’s work ethic and talent, which can
also be a factor in landing a full~time job.

The ﬁve or six interns who work at the

Study Abroad Ofﬁce every term don’t always‘

become full—time employees. During the
seven years Whitehead has worked there,
however, three previous interns have taken
full-time positions. _

' Whitehead estimates that during his time A

at the Study Abroad Ofﬁce, there have been
about six vacancies.

“The position is open to whoever ap-
plies, but it’s nice when former interns apply
because we know what they’re capable of,”
Pilcher said.

Marcus said that cornpanieslike to hire

interns because they’re a proven commodity.

Instead of looking at a person’s proﬁle on a

paper, companies have seen how the interns
work, she said.

Pilcher adds that, often, the interns
end up being the best candidate for the job
because they have a proven record of suc-
cess, but it’s not automatically assumed that
they’ll be selected.

Rather, he said that theinternships are
away for students to get-the attention of
the ofﬁce. ’

Marcus adds that even if students don’t.

get a j ob after their internship, they shouldn’t
use that as an excuse to slack off.
She advises students to stay in contact

with the company because networking is

such a vital component in ﬁnding a job.

Stay in their radar, so when there is a job
opening — in any company — they’ll think
of you, Marcus said.

FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND
PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)'  

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their edu-
cation records: These rights include:

- The right to inspect and review the students education records within 45 days of the day the University receives
a request for access. Students should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other
appropriate program director, written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The University ofﬁ-
cial will make arrangements for access and notify the students of the time and place where the records may be in-
spected. lf the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that offi-
cial shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.

- The right to request the amendment of the students education records that the student believes is inaccurate.
Students may ask the University to amend a record that they believe is in a curate. They should write the Univer-

_sity official responsible for the record, clearly identify thepart of the record they want changed, and specify why it_

is inaccurate.

if his University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student
of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment Addi-
tional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notiﬁed of the right to a

hearing and is available at UP Policy and Procedure 09-08-Oi.

- The right to consent to disclosures of personally identiﬁable information contained in the students

education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without wnsent. One exception, which
permits disclosure without consent, is disclosure to school ofﬁcials with legitimate edurational interests. A school
ofﬁcial is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support
staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the Uni-
versity has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trust-
ees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting an-
other school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the offi-
cial needs to review aneducation record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. Upon request, the
University will disclose education records without consent to ofﬁcials of another school in which a student seeks or
intends to enroll. The University willforward records on request of another school. '

- The right to file a complaint with the US. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by University of
Pittsburgh to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers

tend to meet success both in their military time
and when they move to civilian life.”

Maj. Shawn Gralinski, who helps organize
recruiting efforts, echoed Looney’s points
about the rigors and rewards of ROTC life.

“For a lot of the cadets, it’s ﬂag and country,
but the job security and ﬁnancial aid is clearly
a main draw as well,” Gralinski said. “Not only
do you have a job lined up for graduation, but
there is virtually unlimited potential for ad-
vancement.”

Gralinski said there are about 220 cadets
spread across the 15 academic institutions
that contribute students to the Three Rivers
Battalion. Pitt has the largest proportion of
those cadets, with more than 70 graduate and
undergraduate students spread throughout
almost all the University’s schools and de-
partments.

CMU also has ahigh proportion, Gralinski
said.

He said a majority of the cadets stick with

A the program through graduation, though there

are ways to get out of the ROTC, program. To

, opt of the ROTC program, a student must pay

back everything the army has paid for, includ-
ing scholarships and stipends.
“Like any organization or group, we only

A want those people to participate who want to

participate,” Gralinski said.
Although ROTC recruits make up a sig-

- niﬁcant portion of those Pitt students with

military ties, many armed-services veterans
also choose to attend Pitt after leaving the
military. .

Currently, 430 veterans are pursuing de-
grees throughout the University’s branches,
with about 300 attending classes in Oak-

Today’s difficulty level: Hard  helps Veterans get

land.
Ann Rairigh, director of the Ofﬁce ofVeter—

. ans Services, said these students have strong

academic backgrounds and tend to transfer
credits from previous course work.
She said her office provides a number of

_services to help veterans adjust to campus life,
including military sensitivity training for fac- '

ulty and staff, resume and career development

workshops and networking events.

Her office also helps veterans transfer gov-
ernment Veterans Affairs beneﬁts to pay for a
University education. The amount of compen-
sation varies according to which GI bill a vet-
eran receives beneﬁts from and how long they
served, making Rairigh’s job a tough one.

“Some students can get all of their school
bills paid, while others only receive a couple
hundred dollars a month,” she said. “It’s all
based on time served.”

Rairigh said the University also partici-
pates in the Yellow Ribbon Program to help
pay for some of the costs forsome students
that the GI bills might not cover. The program
can help out-of-state veterans pursuing both
undergraduate and graduate degrees cover
additional costs and fees.

Rairigh added that the University also has a
grant fund to help out—of-state undergraduates

. receiving tuition coverage from the Post-9/11

GI Bill. If the undergraduate receives coverage
at\7O percent or higher, the grant can cover
the difference between in- and out-of-state
tuition.

“We try to do whatever we can to help our
veterans receive the education they deserve,”
she said. “It’s a full-time’ job, but it’s an impor-
tant one.” - "

enrollment rates. Arabic and Chinese language
study especially experienced growth.

Pitt has seen a similar jump, Rehak said,
adding that the enrollment in Arabic classes is
“higher than ever before.”

Rohan said she decided to learn Arabic be-
cause she wanted to study abroad in the Middle
East. A global studies major, she signed up for
the class even though she’d already ﬁlled Pitt’s
language requirement in high school.

Finlay said that students who study abroad
in addition to persuing language studies also
see an advantage.

“We have noticed that having foreign lan-
guage skills, in addition to studying overseas,
has helped recent graduates secure opportuni-
ties abroad,” she said.

Arabic is just another language for Rohan,
who has studied Spanish for seven years in ad-
dition to one semester of Irish Gaelic. She said
she might study French next year, after getting
back from the Middle East —

Although Rohan said her language ac-
complishments will make her “marketable
towards anywhere in the world,” there was
also a’ more personal reason for the foreign
language study."

Rohan is Irish, and she said that was what
compelled her to learn Irish Gaelic.

Rehak said that most people who learn Irish

NATIONAL NEWS

Unemployment

Robin Abcarian
Los Angeles Times (MCT Campus)

LOS AN GELES — It’s an old theory that’s ga1'n— ’

ing new political currency: By cushioning the
blow of unemployment for nearly two years,
jobless beneﬁts discourage recipients from
looking for work:

The claim, most frequently advanced by
conservative pundits and politicians aligned
with the conservative “tea party” movement,

is seen as afresh insult by the nation’s suffering '

unemployed workers.
Nevada Republican U_.S. Senate candidate

- and tea party favorite Sharron Angle, who is

vying for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s
seat, put itthis waythis summer: “You can make
more money on unemployment than you can
going down and getting one of those jobs that
is an honest job but doesn’t pay as much. We’ve
put so much entitlement into our government
that we really have spoiled our citizenry.”
Injuly, as Congress debated extending emer-

- - ‘ gency jobless beneﬁts, an economist from the

conservative Heritage Foundation said on PBS’
“NewsHour” that increasing unemployment
insurance payments to 99 weeks —- the maxi-

mum now available — had “created a bit of a
problem.” Giving help for extended periods,

added William Beach, “changes the behavior of
the people who are unemployed. They don’t look
for work as much as they otherwise would.”

' r In an opinion piece on the Fox News web-

liical rials

benefits a mixed bag

site, economistjohn Lott wrote that the un-
precedented length of today’s unemployment
beneﬁts “is almost like a drug addiction.”

Advocates for workers, and the unemployed
themselves, are pushing back. Last week, a Fa-
cebook group called Extend Unemployment
Beneﬁts, with nearly 4,000 members, received
a ﬂurry of attention. It is devoted to lobbying
for a bill introduced by Sen. Debbie Stabenow,
D—Mich., that would create a new tier of jobless
beneﬁts for those who have exhausted their
unemployment insurance. Pointedly called
the “Americans Who Want to Work Act,” the
bill would provide an additional 20 weeks of
ﬁnancial assistance. Unemployment compen-
s_a_tion is funded by taxes paid by employers,
not by workers. The average weekly check is
about $300. '

Dave Yocom, a 60-year-old college gradu-
ate, has been unemployed since 2008. After
recovering from a stroke at 54 that wiped out

‘liissavings, he left the high—stress restaurant

business and went to work for a construction
company that repaired residential ﬁre and water
damage. He said he is insulted by the idea that
receiving about $400 aweek in unemployment
diminishedhis desire to ﬁnd work, orthatitwas
comparable to drug addiction.

Critics of unemployment, he said, “are ei-
ther incredibly naive, or they . . . have quite

‘ the opinion of themselves if they think it can’t

happen to them.”_ .
Since losing his job, Yocom estimated, he
hassent out 50 resumes a week. He said he

Economy remains uncertain

Unemployment< 22

has received no job offers. He believes that his
age is his biggest impediment. That, and his
ruined credit score, which prospective employ-
ers often check.

His 99 weeks of unemployment insurance
ran out in April. He receives food stampsand
lives in his sister’s home in suburban Chicago.
His sister, unemployed as well, will receive job-
less beneﬁts through November. After that,
Yocom said, he’s not sure how they will make
ends meet.

James Sherk, senior policy analyst in labor
economics at the Heritage Foundation, agreed
that workers like Yocom are in terrible straits,
but said that suchsuffering does notchange the
fact that unemployment beneﬁts lead recipients
to have unrealistic expectations — particularly
in hard-hit industries such as construction or
automobile manufacturing. , '

“Encouraging someone to look for a job that
is not going to return is not ultimately helpful

to them,” Sherk said. “If you have two years of

beneﬁts, it’s natural to spend the ﬁrst six months
lookingforthe same job you had. Somewillﬁnd

jobs, butthe vast majoritywon’t, and they have‘_

A become less productive employees because their
job skills are deteriorating.” _
But Christine Owens, executive director of
the National Employment Law Project, an advo-
cate for workers and the unemployed, said the

point of unemployment insurance is to provide

T Pittsburgh’s

acushion that might protect against downward
mobility.

/ “There’s nothing wrong with the idea that
unemployment beneﬁts would actually enable
someone to spend a little more time looking
for an appropriate job — or, for that matter,
spending time in job training,” Owens said.
“You want people to improve their skills and

. ﬁnd a better job.”

In the current job market, there are nearly

ﬁve unemployed people for every job, according
to the Economic Policy Institute, a pro-labor
think tank. That alone, Owens said, means that
most unemployed workers are out of luck, no
matter how much they yearn for a paycheck.

She cited a recent Rutgers University survey
that found 73 percent of Americans have been
“directly affected” by the current recession,
meaning they had lost a job or had either afam—
ily member or a friend who lost a job.

Unemployment< 23

“We ﬁnd Americans have great sympathy
and empathy for the plight of the unemployed,”
wrote the surveys coauthor, Cliffzukin of the

John]. Heldrich Center for Workforce Develop-
ment at Rutgers. “The unemployed are seen as
wanting towork and trying hard to get jobs.”

Last year, stories popped up about younger
workers looking on the bright side of -layoffs.

and began a blog called Funemployment.
Mansinne, now a graduate student in coun-
seling at Cal State Long Beach, said she used the .
term to make a scary situation less daunting, not
to convey frivolity. Even while on unemploy-
ment, she spent many hours a week looking
for work. But not everyone was as diligent: “I
watched many of my peers take advantage of

. what’s intended to be a temporary solution,”

Mansinne said.
Unemployed older workers often don’t have
the luxury of relaxing. Susan Velcich Rodway, 52,

said she’s looked for work constantly since los-
ing her medical office job in May 2008. “Every
time you go to apply for a job, the line is a mile
long,” said Rodway, who lives in Des Plaines,
Ill. “You’ve got 1,000 people applying for ﬁve
or 10 positions.” , ..

Her family cars have been repossessed. She
and her husband, an unemployed forklift opera-
tor, downsized apartments, lowering their rent
from $900 to $775.

Both are taking online college courses. .

Rodway is studying medical transcription; her
husband is studying information technology.
When they ﬁnish, she estimated, they will have

$30,000 in added debt. . 

» Each week, she gets $192«’and her husband
gets $314 in unemployment beneﬁts. . A
“It’s easy for people who have jobs, insurance
and fancy cars to pass judgment,” Rodway said.

our shoes.” I ~

Margot 8: the Nuclear So and
So’s

Opening acts: The Lonely Forest,
Cameron McGill & What Army
Brillobox

4104 Penn Ave.

' ' Saturday at 9:30 p.m.

Tickets: $12 at the door

Only one band can give its songs

‘ names like “Let’s Paint Our Teeth

Green” and “Lunatic, Lunatic, Lu-
natic” and seem believable, and
that’s Margot & the Nuclear So and
So’s.

The eccentric band is touring in
support of Buzzard, its third and
newest album — or third—and—a—
half, depending on how you look at
it. A dispute with label Epic Records
led to‘ two simultaneous releases in
2008 — Animal! and NotAnimal.

‘ The new CD features the band’s
characteristically surreal, languid

lyrics and howling choruses.
Richard Edwards, the band’s
vocalist, guitarist and driving cre-
ative force, said that he chose the
title “Buzzard” because he “liked
the way it sounded, but it also
sounded weird. And since the last

album was called ‘Animal!’ it sort
of worked.”

Edwards and the rest of his
bandmates have been to Pittsburgh
before and are eager to return.

“They requested. to play the
venue. They’ve played ‘[at the Bril-
lobox] in the past, and they wanted

‘ to have their own event there,” said

Brendan Pester of Opus One Pro-
ductions, theagency that handles
Brillobox bookings..

 The new songs thatfans will hear
this Saturday were the product of
a bizarre approach to production.
Much of Buzzard was recorded in
an abandoned movie theater out-
side Chicago last winter.

Edwards said this method “was
a different way to do things. We try
to do each record slightly different
than we have before and hope that
it yields a different result.”

Furthering the eerie atmo-
sphere, the recording sessions took
place between the hours of 10 p.m.
and 5 a.m., using only candles as
light. '

“We were trying to create a dif-
ferent atmosphere to solicit differ-
ent things from the musicians. The
candlelight created a different vibe,
a little bit more personal than just
studio lights,” Edwards said.

Thankfully, Edwards had writ-

ten all the band’s new material
prior to the dimly-lit recording
sessions.

“I write the songs and then
bring the other musicians in, and

. we all work on them together, but

the writing is really just me in my
apartment,” he said, adding that

- he draws inspiration from “people

I overheard in a bar — anything I
can think of that inspires an idea
can result in a song.”

Edwards said he hopes the
band’s sound will continue to
evolve.

“I always hope the songs are
better on each album. I don’t know
if they are or not, but the energy [in
Buzzard] is a lot different from the
other albums,” he said. “We had a
lot more people involved this time,
a lot more live recording.”

In response to the band’s fre-
quent labeling as a chamber-pop
group, Edwards said, “I don’t really
identify with any of that stuff. It’s
just songs to me.” ’

However, he said the chamber
pop classiﬁcation was inaccurate
for the new album, which does not
feature strings or horns as previous
releases have. _

“It’s a lot of electric guitar and
some drums,” he said.

Edwards was inspired to name

” Arts 89’ Entertainment

j lridie band to go nuclear at Brillobox

his band after Margot from the Wes
Anderson ﬁlm “The Royal Tenen—
baums,” citing the pitch-black sui-
cide sequence as his favorite scene.
That could be a startling admis-

sion for newcomers to the band=,,z
perhaps, but for fans familiar with l
the groups’ surreal qualities, this
shouldn’t come as any surprise. I

New Hazlett Theater

Saturday at 8 p.m. I

6 Allegheny Square E.
http://ww.w.‘newhazletttheater.
org/event/?event_id=4o5
Tickets: $10 a . “

Imagine placing Bob Dylan, Norah.
‘Jones and Prince on a stage and
' telling them to make it work. Not
 an easy task, right? But despite the

seeming incompatibility of their
three genres, folk, jazz and funk
will all come together in a single

, room this Saturday.

Beginning at 8 p.m. at the New
Hazlett Theater with a special in-
troduction by hostsjoe Grushecky

and Rickwitkowski, musicians
Tom Breiding, Heather Kropf and
Anthony Rankin will perform in a
live acoustic show that seems more

A a jam session than an actual con-
_ cert. As is Songwriters Spotlight

procedure, the three Pittsburgh
locals will touch upon selections
of their original music and a song

» they wish they had written.

Grushecky said the most inter-
esting moments are when other
artists. join in atrandom to add a
unique dimension. '

“There are always a couple mo-
ments in the evening where hair
stands up on the back of your
arm,” Grushecky said. “It’s quite
an interesting evening.”

Throughout the night, each art-
ist has the opportunity to connect
with the audience more intimate-
l'y than at a traditional concert,

Grushecky said.

“What a more perfect way to
sit and perform your art in an in-
timate setting with our friends,”
he said. , » -

Rick Witkowski, the self-de-
scribed “sidekick” of Grushecky,
also noted the unique atmosphere
of the New Hazlett Theater.

‘ “People love the vibe of the
place,” Witkowski said. “The
magic is the room itself.” .

T The Northside venue, distin-
guishes itself from other theaters
by its design. Instead of a raised
stage, the room has slanted seat-
ing that faces downward. Perform-
ers are beneath the audience on
-a ﬂat surface that keepsthe two
less distant. p '

‘pl _Gru'shecky said he hopes that
hearing the music in its purest"

form will intrigu_e_ the audience.

-The three musicians are all local
artists, and each represents the
Pittsburgh music scene in a unique
way. ,
Tom Breiding is a folk singer
originally from West Virginia who,
according to Grushecky, writes
well—crafted stories for his songs.
By contrast, Heather Kropf’s jazzy
sound is a cross between “Norah
Jones and Carol King,” Witkowski
said. .

The third act, Anthony Rankin,
graduated from Duquesne Univer-
sity in 2006 with a major in sound
recording. Rankin said_the school
not only gave him an education but
also helped him make connections
