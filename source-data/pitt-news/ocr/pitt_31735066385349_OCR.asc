Pitt helps to plan
school in Hungary

By Kevin?-Gillespie

For The Pitt News

The university has been select-
ed to help create a Western-style
business management school in
Budapest, Hungary, the first
school of its kind in an Eastern-
bloc country. ' 

The International Management

. Center will be created through a
joint venture involving Hungary,
Italy and the United States, with
Pitt's Joseph M. Katz Graduate
School ' of Business and the
Center for International Studies
acting as the primary U.S. link.

The IMC’s main objective is to
provide Western management
training to Hungarian managers
in all aspects of the successful
running of a company, from de-
veloping a motivated work force
to creating accounting systems.

H.J. Zoffer, dean of the Katz
Graduate School of Business,
said, ”The International Manage-
ment Center is an unprecedent-
ed example of international
cooperation crossing ideological

and geopolitical lines to bring the
knowledge of the free market sys-
tem to the centrally planned

economies of east European
countries.

”We are challenged by the op-
portunity to help introduce
Western management theory and
technique to Eastern Europe,”
said Zoffer.

According to Zoffer, the main
challenge that will face the in-
structors at IMC will be the differ-
ent backgrounds and values the
students will have entering the
program.

Daniel Fogel, IMC academic
director and dean—elect, felt that
Pitt’s selection for this project was
based on its strong and ongoing
academic and intellectual interac-
tions with Eastern bloc countries,
and the strength of its business
school and Center for Russian
and East European Studies.

Zoffer said that the ”quality [of
Pitt’s business school] is undoubt-
edly the first factor used in the
selection process. But the
strength and quality of our inter-
national interaction, as well as
President Posvar’s tremendous in-
terest and support towards the
program also played major roles
in the end.”

sets goals

By Erik Kridle

Staff Writer

The newly elected members of
the Student Government Board
are making plans and setting
goals for their upcoming term in
office.

Anastasia Kawalec would like
to see the cafeteria improve its
service to the student communi-
ty by increasing the number of
hours it stays open for meals. She
explained that some students
miss one or more of their meals
per day because cafeteria hours
conflict with their class
schedules.

Trays of sandwiches could be
moved out of the cafeteria itself
and into the checker area where,
after lunch or dinner is over, hun-
gry students could be punched in
and fed, Kawalec said.

”Students will be able to grab
a sandwich and be on their way,”
she said.

Kawalec is also interested in
putting cable television in every
dormitory room on campus. She
feels this idea is supported by
nearly all dorm residents.

”I was thinking it could be
worked like the STS phone sys-

tem,” she said. ”You’d get a bill '

every month, and you'd have to

\

for '89

pay it or get disconnected from
the cable.”

”It would take talking to peo-
ple and a lot of work on my part,
but I think it would be worth it,”
she said.

Board member-elect Justin
Lawhead lived in an off—campus
apartment this past summer
where, he said, ’’I wasn't treated
fairly by my landlord.

”I would like to see student
government provide some sort of
legal aid to student tenants living
in the local area,” Lawhead said.
“This service would help stu-
dents get solid advice in dealing
with their landlords.”

. Lawhead said he isn’t sure
whether Pitt students are willing
to pay for such a service or
whether a local law firm would
be willing to provide such serv-
ices to students at discounted
prices. He suggested that the le-
gal counsel provided be paid for
partly by students and partly by
a university agency.

Board member-elect Julie
Shepard believes that Lawhead’s
plan has merit; however, she is
cautious.

”It’s something"! think needs to
be addressed, but before we
jump into anything we must look

HARRISBURG (AP) ~ Family
and friends of the late state treas-
urer, R. Budd Dwyer, who killed
himselfafter he was convicted of
federal bribery-conspiracy
charges, gathered in his former
office yesterday for the official
unveiling of his portrait.

After the private ceremony on
what would have been his 49th
birthday, the portrait of a smiling
Dwyer was hung in the treas-
urer’s outer office, next to a paint-
ing of the man Dwyer replaced
in 1981, Robert E. Casey. A por-

trait of his successor, G. Davis
GreeneJr., will be placed next to

his after Greene leaves office in

January.

Dwyer’s wife, Joanne, and their
children, Robert and Dyan, at-
tended the invitation-only affair,
along with about 25 former and
present Treasury Department em-
ployees and family friends.
Greene did not attend the
ceremony. ’

Mrs. Dwyer posed with the
portrait for a photographer but
said’ through a Treasury em-
ployee that she would not talk to
a reporter.

”She thought she would be

  Portrait unveiled in honor of Dwyer    

sad, but she was happy,” saidr

Jean Bilunas, who was Dwyer’s
legislative liaison and who
helped plan the ceremony. ”The
people who were here were peo-
ple who had been especially sup-
portive of the family during the
bad times.”

The ceremony offered a chance
to remember better times.
Dwyer, a former teacher, had
served in the state Senate before
being elected treasurer. He was
credited with modernizing the
department and had been consi-
dered a likely Republican candi-
date for lieutenant governor.

Bush to meet, not bargain, with Gorbachev next month

WASHINGTON (AP) -
President-yélect George Bush said
Monday he does not intend his
meeting ext month with Soviet
Presiden Mikhail Gorbachev to
turn intoia bargaining session, but

aides say they will go with 0P€“_

ears and minds.

”It will be President Reagan's
meeting,” Bush said. ”I’|l be
there as vice president of the
United States, and I expect they'll
be aware they're talking to the
next president."

Bush said that ”in terms of
specificity, in terms of my com-
mitting a brand new administra-
tion to specifics in arms control
or anything else, I'm not going to
do that.”

Since the second Reagan-
Gorbachev meeting, in Iceland in
1986, U.S. officials have been
wary of an anything—goes bargain-
ing session.

In Iceland, Reagan and Gor-
bachev discussed eventual elimi-
nation of all nuclear weapons,
upsetting U.S. allies in Western
Europe who rely on U.S. nuclear
deterrence.

Bush and his aides have told
the Soviets they will not be open
to hard bargaining at the meeting
scheduled for Dec. 7, in New

More heavy trading

NEW YORK (AP) — The slug-

two existing bidders, a record

indications that the multibillion-

County officials lose

PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Two AI-

resigned and a third was fired
over ”shoddy” administrative
practices involving documents
about the Ashland Oil Inc.
storage tank that collapsed last
January, officials said Monday.

Allegheny County police Su-
perintendent Robert Kroner said
the county fire marshal’s office
failed to properly review Ash-
land’s plans to reassemble a
storage tank that collapsed Jan. 2
in nearby Jefferson and spilled
about 750,000 gallons of diesel
fuel into the Monongahela River.

Kroner said detectives found
that internal documents were
poorly controlled, resulting in
some files being viewed by the
public.

By Sharon Kerestes
For The Pitt News

Through donations by The
Hillman Foundation, Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial Hall was recent-
ly able to restore five historical
paintings worth more than

. J $100,000.

Three of the five paintings on
display at the military and histo-
ry museum were given national
recognition when they were
reproduced by Time-Life for its
Civil War CIV book. One of the
paintings was also published in
London by Marshall Editions Ltd.
in its Great Battles of the Civil

War.

The restoration work was done
by the Gillespie Co. of Shadyside
and was just recently completed.
Ursula Schmidt, who is in charge
of rental information at Memori-
al Hall, said, ’’It took a couple of
months to do all five paintings.”

She also said that there are
some works in the museum that
still need to be done and some
which are in the process of being
restored.

Kathryn Bostedo, chairwoman
of the board at Memorial Hall,
said, ”There is much preservation
and renovation work needed."
But she added that these projects

The three battle paintings pub-

”Cavalry Charge at Gettysburg,”
the ”Cava|ry Charge by Colonel
Schoonmaker” and ”Farn-
sworth’s Charge and Death.”
These plus two others, ”Captain
Charles S. Preston” and ”The
Duel Between Kearsage and
Alabama,” were given to the
museum by the Grand Army
Republic post for preservation
and safekeeping.

In addition to paintings like
these, the military history muse-
um houses other Civil War and
military relics. The exhibits are
open to the public daily, free of
charge. Also available for refer-
ence and research is the Civil
War library.

said. 0
Shepard is disgusted with the

L lack of space available for study-

ing on campus.

’’I think we need an extension
of the hours Hillman Library is
open to students,” she said. ”This
is supposed to be a fine educa-
tional institution. It really hinders
the students when there is no
place nearby to study late at
night.”

If the library were to remain
open later at night and on
weekends for students to study,

there should be no reason why it
couldn't also be functional,
Shepard said.

Like Kawalec, board member-
elect Jill Phillips is concerned
with the eating habits of Pitt
students.

Phillips is encouraging Student
Health Services to provide more
educational programs in areas of
nutrition and sexual relations.
Phillips is also very critical of the
medical treatment she has
received at SHS and questions
whether the services provided
there are satisfactory.

Hold on to your hat:
Mr. Downey is here

On Sunday, Dec. 4, Pitt students will have the op-

portunity to participate in America's newest fad: yeI|- I

ing with Morton Downey Jr.

The Pitt Program Council used $10,000 of student
activity funds to pay Mr. Downey to speak here at
Pitt on the topic of legalizing drugs. The event
promises to be a popular and controversial one.

Technically, Morton Downey Jr. is a ”talk show
host.” However, his appeal to the American public
stretches far beyond simple communication. Each

—Morton Downey Jr. show offers viewers 60-minutes
of insults, sarcasm, pointless screaming and old-
fashioned scapegoating. Regardless of the topic, Mr.
Downey has demonstrated his ability to transform an
audience into a ‘street gang. In our society, it is no
surprise that he's a syndicated hit.

Much of Mr. Downey’s audience stems from col-
lege campuses. In scheduling Mr. Downey, the Pitt
Program Council acted in the tradition of entertain-

Morton Downeylr. is not a legitimate public figure

On television, Mr. Downey may appear to address

On Dec. 4, one shouldn't expect Mr. Downey to
provide any insight to the debate of drug legaliza-
tion. However, it should be quite a show.

I am from a small town in Mon-
tana called Columbia Falls. I
don’t really know why it was
named after waterfalls, because
it's in the middle of the Rockies
and there really aren't any falls
around. Maybe it was because of
:all the people who fell off of the
mountain.

The town, or village, I should
say, is about 50 miles from the
Canadian border and about a mil-
lion miles from modern civili-
zation. '

There is one movie theater, a
post office and a B&B (equivalent
to a Giant Eagle). There is a Piz-
za Hut, though, and a Mc
Donald's about 20 miles away...

So why the reminiscing about
Cowboy Land?

Frankly, most people I have en-
countered here have no idea
where Montana is. If I weren't
from the state, I probably
wouldn't know either.

A little clarification: Montana is
a really big piece of land between
North Dakota and Idaho. (Be-
vond Idaho is Washington, get

Latest statistics show that about
750,000 people live there. That's
like taking Pittsburgh and the sur-
rounding area and sticking it in
the middle of nowhere. (As if it
isn't already... oops, sorry
Sophie.)

So what’s so damned wonder-
ful about Montana thatwarrants
space here? Well, I’m really sick
of listening to cowgirl jokes and
it really isn't such a bad place af-

Once again, Vince Carey has
seen fit to show his lack of school
spirit by verbally attacking the
University of Pittsburgh Varsity
Marching Band in one of his
”sports” articles. The article to
which I refer is in The Pitt News
of Nov..14, I988 on page 16. I
feel that the Pitt Band performed
one of its best halftime shows
ever, and I'm not just saying that
because I happen to be the drum
major. We put a lot of hard work
into creating a show to entertain
the football fans during a game.
We put in too much work to have
a misinformed ”sports writer” de-
grade‘ us. Why is a sports writer
commenting on the band in the
first place? His poisonous barbs
do not reflect very well on his
professionalism or that of The Pitt
News, because itappears The Pitt
News supports unprofessional
and uninformed opinions. 

I believe in freedom of speech
provided one has some
knowledge of the subject at hand.

Vince Carey has no such know--

ledge, for if he did, he would not
have printed such ignorant re-

marks in his articles. I defy him

to invest the time, money and
dedication that is required to

I learn how to play an instrument,

twirl a baton and dance, or spin

ter all.

For ski buffs (cross—country and
downhill both), there are many
undiscovered resorts that the pa-
trons of Vail have yet to find. The
lines are shorter and the‘ ride
down more exciting. Seven
Springs doesn't even come close.

There is a huge beautiful place
called Glacier National Park,
which is right on the border of
Canada. There are still leftover
glaciers sort of hanging around,
and there's even a pink one. (Old
Milwaukee beer filmed a com-
mercial there not too long ago,
’cause you know it just doesn't
get any better than this.)

Custer had his last stand in
Montana.

There are a lot of Native Ameri-
cans still there. There are some
obscure tribes called the Flat-
heads and the Blackfeet. Unfor-
tunately, our society still looks
down on Indians, and they're sort
of having a difficult time.

There are people from the '60s
who dropped out of society liv-
ing up in those thar hills. There

a flag so that he can enjoy the
marching band experience.
Perhaps if he would have invest-
ed the time, money and dedica-
tion that it takes to learn how to
write professionally, then maybe
he would have learned to

ing about them. 

Brian K. Lincoln
Drum Major — Pitt Band

Bush was not a clear victor

Thomas Danyluk — [...] To be
quite honest, I was perplexed by

your editorial last Thursday. [...] .

If I am to understand Mr. Dany-
luk correctly, the premise of his
argument is that ”Bush was the
clear choice of a conservative
America.“ [...]

First of all, a 54 percent margin
does not represent a ’’clear’’ vic-
tory. It does not represent that
George Bush has a ”clear” man-

date as our next president. Mr.

Danyluk, it means that for nearly
every other person that you meet,
that you speak to  that person
voted for Mike Dukakis. Thus,

are also a couple of Vietnam vets
who have cabins in remote areas
of the state.

Believe it or not, there are still
cattle drives from Colorado up to
southern Montana, and yes, there
are cowboys with real ‘hats, real
boots and real chewing tobacco.

The continental divide goes
through the state.

Montana is split into mountains
on the left and prairie on the
right. There are deserted oil rigs
that stand in memorial to the
booming oil days.

Patrick Duffy's parents used to
live in Montana, before they got
killed in a bar.

The Church Lady of Saturday
Night Live fame is from the state.

A lot of people carry guns; in
fact almost everyone does. No
wonder Dukakis lost the state.

There are lots of horses, too.

Doesn't sound all that bad
now, does it?

I'd like to clear up some myths
now, about people from
Montana:

1. My name is Jessica, not

deserves more recognition

with this percentage now’ in per-
spective, it does not representla
”clear” anything, except that you
clearly do not grasp the fact that
George Bush won —. but by only
in terms of the slightest margin.

If you insist upon referring to
George Bush's claim that he has

~ a mandate with the ”people,"

then you ought to recognize that
the people were sharply divided.

Secondly, if Bush were a ”clear '

choice of a conservative Ameri-
ca,’,’ then why do the Democrats
control the House and the
Senate. (Oh, whoops — forgot
about that, didn't ya, Mr.
Danyluk?)

The fact is  that your writing
reflects a’ very shallow level of
thinking. Defining ”main-
stream” America was a concept
that the Republican used during
this election to paint Mike
Dukakis as some type of political
misfit. [...]

Jessica-Sue or Jessica-Joe Bob.
2. I don't say y'all or howdy.
3. I don't ’rassle cows neither.
4. I don't chew.

5. I cook my meat first.

6. I don't have any checkered
apparel, although the sound of it
is appealing.

7. I have a pair of cowboy
boots, but I bought them in Penn-
sylvania.

8.» I'm not bowlegged.

9. I don't think Merle Haggard
is groovy. I don't have one Way-
lon or Willie album. I like the
Doors, Siouxsie and the Banshees
and, of course, Elvis.

So I hope this piece of silliness’
has cleared up some misconcep-

tions about people (cowboys and ‘

cowgirls alike) who are from the
West. '

time to read this far. Y'all come

Women's swim team loses first to Virginia

By Chris Bosak

Staff Writer

The Pitt women's swim team
dropped a hard-fought battle
against Virginia on Saturday,
175-125. The loss brings Pitt's
record to 3-1.

«Virginia, a top-10 team, led
throughout the whole meet but
never pulled too far ahead of the
Lady Panthers. Halfway through
the meet, Pitt trailed by only 22
points.

"I'm proud of the way they

  SPORTS

responded,” said Pitt coach
David Belowich. "We swam
against a top-10 team, and [Vir-
ginia] swam like a top-10 team.

''It was a good effort all around.
I'm pleased with everything ex-~
Cept the final score. I don't like
to lose."

The final score may have been

‘ a low point for Pitt, but some

great individual efforts highlight-
ed the day.

Two Pitt school records were
broken — one by Karin Masal in
the 200—yard breaststroke, and

Wrestling team gives  
strong performance at
weekend's tournament

By Mike Rampa
Staff Writer

Wrestling coach Rande Stott-
lemyer is optimistic about the up-
coming season after this past
weekend's Ohio Open tour-
nament.

Four Pitt wrestlers placed in the
top 10: Scott Hovan (150) was
fourth, Dave Ciafre (150) placed
sixth, and Jeff Turner (158)
finished fourth.

Defending national champion
Pat Santoro (142) lost to rival
Mike Cole from Clarion Univer-
sity and placed second.

Stottlemyer acknowledged’ the
fact that Santoro will have his
work cut out for him this year in
order to stay on top. "Right now
he's going to have to fight for his
life, but without a doubt, he's
willing to pay his dues," Stot-

J tlemyer said.

Several wrestlers performed
surprisingly well, namely Matt
Rizzo, Robert Simpson and Chris
Baer. Stottlemyerhopes their per-
formance levels will remain high
throughout the season.

In order for Pitt to have a suc-
cessful season in the Eastern
Wrestling League conference,
Stottlemyer hopes to keep his
wrestlers in the right weight class-

es. "We can stay with most teams .

in the conference; we've got to
pull together as a team and stay
healthy," he said.

Injuries are already taking a toll
on the squad. Jeff Turner is out
with a knee problem, and Perry
Miller is sidelined with a shoul-
der injury which is nothing seri-
ous according to Stottlemyer, but
he will be out of action for a
while just asa precaution. Sean
Gibbs should be back on the mat
shortly. 1

"We’re not the best or the
worst team in the conference, but
we are very competitive. When
people talk college wrestling,
they always mention the Big 10,
the Big Eight and the EWL; and
we're right up there with some
excellent teams,” Stottlemyer
said.

This Saturday, the team will
travel to Lock Haven, Pa., to com-

the other by Laura Lee Sullivan in
the 100 breaststroke. Both Masal
and Sullivan are freshmen.

Masal swam the 200 breast-
stroke in a time of 2:20.77, break-
ing the old record of 2:21.98 set
by Jodi O'Neil in 1984.

"During warm—ups, I didn't feel
like I was in shape to break a
record,” Masal said. "It's ex-
citing.”

"She's awesome," said team-
mate Krissa Ratliff as she put her
arm around Masal.

Cavaliers too much for men's swim
team to handle in first loss of season

By Scott Campbell

Staff Writer

The men's swimming team
suffered its first loss of the season
to an excellent Virginia team,
134-109, on Saturday, but
seemed pleased to have stayed
that close to the 15th-ranked
Cavaliers.

''I don't think we've ever
[swum] against a team that's been
ranked that high in my history at
Pitt, and we were right there with
them,” said Coach Dick
Bradshaw.

The loss dropped Pitt to 3-1 for
the season.

The Panthers fell behind early,
64-29, after losing four of the first
five events. The two teams swam
evenly the rest of the way, but as
soon as Pitt made a move they
were squelched by the Cav:lie.':
in the next event.

"It stayed pretty close, but
somehow they always found a
way to win,” said junior Tim
Adams, who led Pitt with two in-
dividual victories and was also
part of the winning 400-meter

freestyle relay team with Bill
Folger, Matt Porter and Eric
Daum.

"On paper, they looked to be
a lot better than us, but we swam
really well. Actually, we swam a
lot better than we thought we
would,” said Adams.

Pitt posted its best marks-this
year in nine of the 13 events, in-
cluding Adams, who won the 50
freestyle in 21.23 seconds and
the 100 freestyle in 46.78.

"For this time of the year, I was
definitely happy with the times,
especially against a good team
like Virginia,” said Adams, who
would like to get down to about
20.4 and 44.8 seconds in the two
events in order to qualify for the
NCAA Championships at the end
of the year.

Other victories for Pitt were
netted by the diving team, which
won both of its events for the
third—straight meet.

Once again, junior John Shar-
key and senior Vernon Yenick led
the way.

Sharkey won the 1-meter event
while Yenick finished second. In

the 3-meter, Yenick edged out
Sharkey for the top spot. Sharkey
and Yenick have combined to
win every diving event so far this
season. _

In other events, Mike Kozlina
finally proved to be human. The
junior from Aliquippa lost his first
events of the year.

Kozlina lost his best event, the
200 backstroke, to Glenn Houck,
an NCAA finalist last year.

Houck and Kozlina, along with
1988 Olympic silver medalist
David Berkoff from Harvard, are
considered three of the best back-
strokers in the country.

"Houck and Kozlina had a
couple of good races. Houck
won this time, but we'll see what
happens next time,” said
Bradshaw.

That "next time” will come
Dec. 1-3, when Virginia returns
to participate at the Pitt Invita-
tional.

Bradshaw said that Pitt should
do better against UVA at the in-
vitational meet.

’'I think even though we lost to-

mance of 1:05.93 in the 100
breaststroke broke Pitt's old
record of 1:06.08 also set by
O'Neil.

''It felt great," said Sullivan. ''I
guess I was a little surprised."

Ratliff was upset in the 1-meter
diving competition and finished
second. The inspired Ratliff
turned in an excellent perfor-
mance in the 3—meter dive and
won that competition.

''I had a really good meet on
3-meter," said Ratliff. ''I don't like
to lose twice in one day."

qualifying meet to be held in
March.

Laure Walczak took first place
in the 50 free style, with an in-
pressive time of 00:24.45.

but came up with 10 second-
place finishes, most of which
were close seconds.

The Pitt women's volleyball
team, fresh from capturing the
Big East championship, at-
tempts to qualify for the NCAA
tournament at Arlington,
Texas this weekend.

The Lady Panthers (23-8)
will be competing in the
Texas-Arlington Volleyball
Classic, where they will be
challenged by the seventh-
ranked Mavericks of Texas-
Arlington, 17th-ranked Lady
Wildcats of Arizona and the
Aggies of Texas A&M.

Pitt's first round game on Fri-
day night against Texas-
Arlington (23-3) is crucial to
the Lady Panthers’ NCAA tour-
nament hopes. Since the Big
East champion no longer
receives an automatic tourna-

to qualify as an at—large entry.

If the Lady Panthers defeat
Texas-Arlington, they will be
given serious consideration by
the selection committee; if

they defeat Arizona on Satur-
day, they will be in the NCAA
field.

Despite Texas-ArIington's
national ranking, Pitt has a
legitimate chance at beating
them. Two weeks ago at the
Western Michigan Invitation-
al, the Lady Panthers threw a
scare into Texas-Arlington be-
fore ‘being defeated by a
16-14, 15-5 and 18-16 count.

As for Arizona, Pitt has al-
ready defeated the Lady Wild-
cats on their home court this
year. On Oct. 14, Pitt defeat-
ed the contingent from Tucson
in a classic confrontation by
the score of 7-15, 15-13,
16-14, 14-16 and 16-14.

Texas A&M, while a solid
squad, should not pose any
particular problems for the
Lady Panthers, particularly if
they win their first two
matches.

Pitt coach Shelton Collier
feels his team has a solid shot
at pulling off a few surprises.

Bradshaw said. ’’I think we know

’’It won't be a surprise or any-
