Flaherty Wins Co

PITTSBURGH

Allegheny County Commissioner,

winning election with his running

mate, incumbent Thomas Foerster,

and Republican Clerk of Courts

Robert N. Peirce. .
Peirce displaced Dr. William

Hunt as the minority member of

the three-man commission.

With 1,083 of 1.309 p_recincts
.§,-reporting, Flaherty had 169,194
/ Foerster 163,268; Peirce

,1/votes;
145,960 and Hunt 143,241.

A number of minor party and
independent candidates trailed
with very small percentages of the
total vote.

Flaherty, the brother of popular
Pittsburgh Mayor Pete Flaherty,
unseated Democrat Leonard
Staisey in the May primary.

Staisey and Foerster have had
their share of differences with
Mayor Flaherty through the years,
most notably on the moribund
Skvbus rapid transit project, but

' Foerster and the Flahertys closed

ranks as the commissioner’s

255-campaign progressed.

It was Jim F1aherty’s first try for
public office, although he has

FASC Talks
Budgeting
Participation

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
Faculty participation in budget
matters and tenure decisions
dominated discussion in yester-
day's Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Council (FASC) meeting.

In line with a University Senate
Council proposal to create budget
policy committees at the school
level throughout Pitt, FASC began
deliberations on a method for
implementation.

“The two options here could be
to use the entire FASC as the group
mentioned- by Senate Council, or to
create a special committee that is
wholly or partially ap ointed,” said

Money, Not Morals,
Th rottled ‘Throat’

BY CONNIE GIEL

Funding for showings of the
-movie Deep Throat was denied not
on a moral basis but rather for
monetary . reasons, according to
Student Government (SG) Alloca-
tions Committee. member.

But Sanford Silverberg, presi-
dent of the Amateur Radio
Association (ARA), the group
requesting the funds, insists the
funding refusal stems improperly
from moral and legal compunctions
held by Allocations and Student
Activities Director Dan Meloro.

“They've said they only reason
we can’t show it is because we

. could make more money on another

ﬁlm,” Silverberg said. “But that's
saying we can show a ﬁlm but not
this ﬁlm, and that’s a moral
judgment.” ‘ ’

Allocations member Kevin Joyce
said the ARA doesn’t really need
the money, at least not as much as
its estimated proﬁt of $1,700.

Berns--“WhoRu|es Pitt?" r 

BY NORM MARTELLO,

Pitt is paid for by the state
government and controlled by a
small self-perpetuating Board of
Trustees made up of the corporate

elite of the City of Pittsburgh,

according to Neil Berns, aﬁocialist
Worker’s party representative. ‘

Berns, a steelworker at U.S.
Steel’s Clairton Works, spoke to an
audience of approximately 20 on
Monday at a forum entitled “Who
Rules Pitt?”

“The University of Pittsburgh is
st‘ate—related, but it is governed
entirely by the Board of Trustees of
the University,” Berns
“That Board of Trustees also
governs its own affairs and makes
its own bylaws.”

He explained the bylaws provide
for 36 voting members on the
Board, including 12 charter trus-
tees appointed with a mandatory
retirement at age 65.

“They’re essentially a holdover

said. ‘

,from Pitt's days as a private

institution,” Berns said. “When
,Pitt became state-related, these
charter trustees were brought
along and the same people who
controlled Pitt then control Pitt
now.” ' '=
The otheriBoard members are 12

commonwealth trustees appointed .

by the state, six alumni and six
term trustees elected annually by
the Board. There also are four
non-voting members, including the
chancellor, Berns noted.

“I think it is interesting to note
that Chancellor Posvar is a charter
trustee of the University,” he said.
“This has not been the case
generally with the chancellors at
the University of Pittsburgh.”

He said the trustees have
dominant inﬂuence in appointing
term and alumni trustees and that
the inﬂuence of commonwealth
trustees was “rather small.”

“Pitt’s Board of Trustees exhib-
ited the attitude, not of similarity to

the state government, which
relatively honored the formation of
unions, but an attitude more
reminiscent of the steel trust, the
Mellon interest, one of adamant
and unalterable opposition to the
formation of the unions,” Berns
charged.

Board Chairman William H. Rea
“has an enormous amount of
power at the University since the
chairman appoints the members of
all standing committees of the
Board with the exception of the
executive committee,” Berns said.

He listed business interests in
which charter trustees serve as
ofﬁcers or ‘directors. They include
Western Electric, PPG Industries,
Hillman Coal and Coke Company,
Gulf Oil, General Electric, Mellon
Bank and Pittsburgh National
Bank.

“I can go on and on,” he said.

Pitt Board members also are
involved with WQED, the boards of

(Continued on Page 3)

“You have to know several

things about the ARA before you
judge,” Joyce said. “The ARA
needs only $50 to purchase

equipment, and there are easier .'

ways to make 50 bucks.”
Silverberg said an additional
$80, denied by Allocations, is
needed to buyvother materials.
“Therefore it’s not a question of
$50,” he said. “The ARA has a

‘right to try to make as much money
as possible’, as would any student ’

organization."

Joyce explained the decision was-

consistent with Allocations ﬁlm-

«funding policies. When an organi-

zation wants to show a ﬁlm,

. Allocations usually requests it to

join with the Franklin Pangborn
Film Club in co-sponsorship,
Exceptions are made for films

Pangborn does not show, he said,

as they are considered legitimate
requests for funds. ‘

“We didn't think it.»was right to
put up the $600 needed to book the

film,” Joyce said. .‘‘It .C_1i_dn’t seem '

necessary." . V . .

BY GEORGENE KALEINA

The annual Writers’ Conference will not be held this
year because of lack of funds, according to Assistant
English Professor Lee Gutkind.

Several students complained about the Writers’
Conference cancellation. “The Writers‘ Conference was
the only outlet on this campus where students could
personally meet with professional writers," one student
said. “I learned a lot about writing from the
professionals."

Another student said, ‘It's disgusting that students
won't be able to get ﬁrst-hand viewpoints from writers.”

The Writers’ Conference budget was cut by one-third,
according to Gutkind. “The Student Activities Ofﬁce
reduced the budget by $1,500 and without that money, I
couldn't pursue it." Gutkind said. “lt’s very difficult to
raise that extra money."

Approximately $2,000 from CAS, $500 from the English

 .,.. .....z.. .;  g.

ticket sales made up the budget last year, Gutkind said.
“With so much money cut this year, we couldn’t do it.”

The Conference was responsible for fundingwriters’
travel, hotel and food expenses, as well as a small
honorarium, according to Gutkind. “We usually kept these
costs at a minimum," he added.

The Writers’ Conference has had writers such as John
Knowles, Nelson Algren, Helen Thomas, Tom Mcl-Iale and
editors from various ‘magazines, including Esquire,
Atlantic and Sports Illustrated.

“This conference was the only activity that brought the
English departments from branch campuses together,"
Gutkind said. ‘

CAS Dean Robert Marshall said, however, the money for
the Writers‘ Conference still would be available. “The
question is how much, and we would have to ﬁgure that

out," he added. “I allotted so much last year because I was '

so pleased with it."
‘ Student Activities Director Dan .Meloro said he cut the

budget was reduced by 132. “We had to cut left and right

to account for this,” Meloro said‘. “We didn’t have the‘ ‘Z I

money and had to cut somewhere.”

Meloro said therewould be no change in the budget
according to the ﬁve-year budget forecast. “The budget

will decrease annually and we have to cut accordingly,” he 6

added. “The Writers’ Conference was our only real
programming activity and there was no return on it.” '

Because student activities funding was taken away, it

should not mean a “death blow” for the program, Meloro

said. “The».program should be re-evaluated.”

“When you consider that possibly only 250 students I

beneﬁt from this program, it's feasible to think there’s 400
students who want equipment for a psychology lab or
basketballs for intramurals,” Meloro said.

Gutkind noted Pitt is one of the few colleges with a
writing program that does not have a writer-in—residence or
a reading program to bring in writers for a day, or tyvo to

Further decision on the matter
will come at the next FASC
meeting, including the matter of
student participation in the budget

FASC also discussed the upcom-
ing full Faculty of Arts and
Sciences meeting on tenure policy,
at which the recently revised
Schulman Resolution will be
considered along with other plans
for involving faculty in the tenure-
awarding process.

The Schulman Resolution sur-
faced in the last full FAS meeting,
but debate never came to a close as
a result of a quorum call that found
the meeting short of neccesary
attendance. .

The resolution calls for a
“multi-tier” review system of
tenure decisions, similar to one

"now . used at Camegie-Mellon

workers, research support person-
nel and other non-professionals
excluding managerial and supervi-
sory personnel.

PSEA representative

Butera said this unionization effort
had nothing to do with efforts
currently underway by the PSEA in
the area of collective bargaining for
faculty. -
. “There’s no connection,” Butera
said. “This is simply a case of
people wanting the terms and
conditions of their employment
spelled out in a binding legal
contract.” ’ '

If the University rejects the
request for joint recognition or
elections, the next step would be to
petition the State Labor Relations
Board and conduct hearings on the
matter, Butera added.

Because the support personnel
are employes of a state-related
institution (Pitt), the unionization
effort comes under the‘ Public

(Continued from Page 1}
have been scheduled for December
6 in David Lawrence Hall. The
booking is not yet conﬁrmed, but
Silverberg aid the ﬁlm is available
for University use on that day.

The Deep Throat booking agent,
David Reinback of the New
York-based SRO Entertainment,
said he and Silverberg had an
understanding when the film
tentatively was booked that SRO
would take the risk upon itself to
forward the ﬁlm without advance
ﬁnancial backing.

“Sanford told me it was
University policy not to show a ﬁlm
unless it has ﬁnancial backing, so
no one gets stuck," Reinbach said.
“So, because of my faith in the
guaranteed response of Deep
Throat, ltold him I’d cover for it.”

But inherent in the SRO backing
was Reinbach’s further under-
standing that the ARA would clear
the way for the ﬁlm showing. “He
told me there might be trouble at
Pitt, and I said that's his
responsibility," Reinbach said.

When told of the Pitt funding
ban, Reinbach said, “Student
Government ought to be an

accurate reflection of campus
desires and tastes. It should be
more an agency of students and
less a reflection of the cinematic
tastes of the departments that run
it."

An unofficial poll taken by
Silverberg showed 85% of students
asked “Do you think the ARA
should be permitted to show the
film Deep Throat on campus?" said
yes. Most people supporting the
showing said they did so because
the University should not be able to
censor it, Silverberg claimed.

Since the booking agent already
has guaranteed the funds, the ARA
no longer is concerned primarily
with the Allocations decision. “But
we'd like to have Student Govern-
ment fund us," Silverberg said,
“because we want to have that kind
of backing in case we have to go
through Meloro and (Vice Chancel-
lor of ' Student Affairs) Alfred
Moye."

“As far as Dan Meloro's decision
goes, I think he's already decided
not to let us show the ﬁlm—he's
just waiting for the Student
Government’s decision," Silver-
berg complained.

MADRID, Spain (AP)—Five

trustees of Carnegie-Mellon Uni-
versity and Chatham College, the
boards of Presbyterian, Children’s
and Mercy hospitals, the Pitts-
burgh. Symphony and the Pitts-
burgh Ballet, Berns noted.

“The charter trustees direct the
cultural, artistic and corporate life
of the City of Pittsburgh. To the
best of my knowledge this doesn’t
include any women, blacks, Jews
or Catholics, or trade unionists.
Just the businessmen, the corpor-
ate elite of Pittsburgh.

“This is the pattern of most
major universities in the‘United
States.” Berns said.

He referred to a nationwide
survey to show that college and
university boards of trustees are
86% male, 67% 50 years or older,
5% under 40 years old, 58%

Republican and 1.3% black.

“Their children go to the Ivy
League schools. They go to
Princeton, Yale, Harvard, but they
certainly don’t go to Pitt,” he said.

Pitt provides an educated labor
force of white-collar workers, which
is the fastest growing segment of
the American labor force, and
teaches a business ideology that

maintains a society in which "these
same trustees are running just
about everything,” according to
Berns.

He added that the University
temporarily absorbs surplus labor
so students “are not on the job
market raising the level of
unemployment.”

“The University of Pittsburgh in
large part funded by the govern-
ment is doing the basic research
that corporations don’t want to pay
to do themselves,” Bems said-

To change the power structure at
Pitt, “you have to change the
structure of the society as it exists.
You have to change the people who
control that society. ‘

“That’s a very far-reaching goal
that won’t come about easily, but I

think it’s a goal that is realizable,”
Berns said.

In a discussion following the
speech, Pitt student

showing Pitt's average QPA‘ is

rising and that the University said 

it would go on a campaign to force
the QPA down to 2.0.

“Pitt is trying to produce
students who will ﬁll the increasing"
number of technical and adminis-
trative jobs that the economic
structure requires,” she said. “It

is certainly not one bit interested in ' r ,
developing the full intellectual, . 

artistic abilities of its students.

“‘It’s trying to produce not the
best, but the mediocre.” '

Tuition Hike Defense

\ --*-~-~-rr/

7

Under the banner of education as a right, rather than as a privilege,

ﬂtudent Government Board (SGB) member Mark Satinoff is trying to

» devise a plan that would prevent tuition hikes at Pitt.
Through appealing to national student groups and schools whose
students have been successful battling hikes and program cutbacks,
' Satinoff intends to make their methods work here. A
His philosophy throughout last summer’s tuition hike problem and ‘
the ensuing struggle by Satinoff and SGB President Lany Platt to have ‘ G

the level-one budget released was that studentpower lies in numbers.

. Satinoff called the START-UP lobby effort ineffective right from the i s
start, and now he sees the need to educate students_ in University

ﬁnances.

He will have no easy task arousing a student body concerned more

with grades than with politics.

. . We mustn't let this difficulty stand between Satinoff’ s efforts and

our wholehearted support.

In retrospect, the problem with START -UP was the naivete students
displayed in rushing off 2,0()0 superﬁcial letters to state legislators, ._ --
. hoping Pitt’s aid would be increased automatically.
' Satinoff’ s objective is to inform students about hikes and cutbacks - - --
so, in the event of another crimch, they will act rationally and perhaps

this time to their own beneﬁt.

Cool, reasoned convincing, which would have to be used at Satinoff’ s
teach-ins, is probably the hardest way to win‘ someone over since it
‘uses no gimmickry. Satinoff hopes to lay all the cards on the table and

show students how toplay out their hand.

As we did during the call for the level-one, we strongly back
Satinoff’ s renewed and unceasing efforts. He certainly has his work cut

out for him.

Guest column

‘BY RICHARD F. ULRICH

This article is a brief response to
the‘facts and precipitous optimism
found in Dan Mulholland's “A
Case for Nuclear Reactors," which
appeared recently in the Pitt News.

He ,is wrong about several
economic factors—uranium is in-
creasing rapidly in cost as it is in
short supply (ask Westinghouse).
Reactor costs are skyrocketing.
The unknown life span of large
reactors, if much under 30 years,

' would make nuclear power the
grandest fiasco in investment
history. Only 70 large plants are in
operation, mostly for four years or
less. Even after recent cancella-
tions, twice that many are on order.
Average use of planned capacity is
only 55%, and it possibly decreases
after the first few years of
operation. Cracking pipes, etc.,
have meant additional “down"
time.

Ralph Nader, as Mulholland

  Advice for the Unaware

BY JOHN METCALFE

Because I have been a student for so many years,
and l have grown old during those many years,’
almost to the point of being venerable, I am
zonsidered a graduate student. Actually, it wasn’t_
zhat simple. I did have to graduate in order to
become etc...At any rate, one of the privileges of
graduate students in the English Department is that
they have mailboxes. I" have had one for about a_
year, excluding a brief period last spring when, in a
reorganization of mailboxes, mine vanished. It just
winked away, like an eye that would never open
again.

Graduate students are much like other students.
They have no direct way of knowing their condition
and standing from one day to the next. They are
likely to behave in odd existential ways if they are
mysteriously extirpated from that honorable
company of those who have mailboxes in the
department.

No matter. I was restored to grace; whether I had
given offense and later been forgiven, or had been
brieﬂy forgotten and then remembered, the effect
was much the same.

I felt restored. For the first couple of weeks 1
would dredge my mailbox with a smile that was
almost a. song on my lips. Whoever was
mimeographing all that stuff was thoughtful enough
to include a copy for me.

Today I am busy being disenchanted. True, there

minutes of the. meetings of the past; advertisements
of coming events; even heartfelt pleas for
cooperation in worthy and potentially rewarding

r causes. Among all this there was a serpent.

It seemed harmless enough. It was dittoed on the
‘ same dull paper in the same pale purple as almost
everything else in the academic world. It was not
even typed; it had been scrawled in human
handwriting directly on a mimeograph master.
It was disarmingly simple. I will give you the
entire text, except for the address:

reveal, and a company name at an address in
Pittsburgh 15222. There was no mention that the
address was a well-known building downtown, nor

that the ﬁrm was an employment agency which

occupies a suite on an upper ﬂoor of that building.

An innocent person like myself might go home
whistling and composing a resume for the person
who had advertised so charmingly. An innocent
person like myself would almost certainly come out of
the experience with a suspicion not only of having
been VlCtIm1Z€d but of being about a thousand dollars
poorer than before.

Venerable age confers few beneﬁts beyond the odd
mailbox in the department. If there are children,
they will be ungrateful; if there is expertise, it
already will be outdated; if there is wisdom, it will be
irrelevant. However, we, the ancient, may be able to
pass along those expensive lessons that not only
fester in our spirits, but still lurk waiting for new
young victims. 0
extra charge, I will tell you what it cost me nine
hundred dollars to learn. Employment agencies
propose to match job-seekers with jobs. Sometimes
they succeed. They examine the job-seeker, put him
or her through a few aptitude tests, presumably look
into character. police records. and the like, and seek
out firms that might want to hire such a person.
Sometimes a person is placed. Payment, based on a

‘percentage (between 8 and 20 percent of a year's

wages) is due before the job begins. Unsecured

' loans are going at annual percentage rates of 20 to 24

per cent--at reputable lenders.

Employment ofﬁces relieve their client employers
of the trouble and expense of maintaining their own
personnel offices. Do the grateful client employers
pay them for this relief? If they do, the employment
agencies bill the job-seekers as well.

Perhaps the person or firm that introduced this
noxious offer into my mailbox and many others hoped
the habit of research, which is the common property
of all graduate students, would be extinguished by
the force of greed and hope, and that nobody would
even consult the telephone book to expose the fraud.
Perhaps they already have victims committed to
paying thcmureal sums for possible jobs. I might
easily have been one such. ' f

it is bad enough‘ to be. assaulted at the home
milllbox; we have all learned to expect that. But’ to

‘effusions of the

says, strongly opposes current
nuclear development; but most
Americans don't know that. Mul-
holland quotes a recent Harris poll
(commissioned by a reactor con-
struction ﬁrm). Thus for one
question the poll revealed “64%
believed nuclear power was safe;
but in the same poll, less widely
reported, (“Not Man Apart,”
mid-October, 1975), 61% of those
who previously favored nuclear
plants in their community would
change their opinion if Ralph Nader
opposed construction." Does this
“render_Nader's position unten-
able," as Mulhollandsays?

The thermal pollution problem
has been “solved" by creating
huge banks of fog. Nuclear power
requires more cooling than conven-
tional power. Core wastes, so far,
are stored in steel and concrete
tanks that won’t last 50 years.
Tanks can't be too big or the
corrosive fluid boils. Underground
storage must not_leak for 80,000
years. .

The risk calculation scenarios for
nuclear plants have been criticized
strongly for arbitrariness. Proper
design and construction are as-
sumed. Human error and sabotage
are ignored. “Deaths" remain few
when assessed over 50 or 100
years, instead of'over the particle-
emitting period. What to do with
old worn-out power plants (ie, 30

. Letter

Fatal as Fatal Can Be

years from now) may be a problem,
since scrapping-is difficult.

Mainly, problems of technology
and safety have stymied nuclear
reactor development. An invest-

ment of $120 billion (Mulholland) isIT“>:

massive, but the old problems
remain. With international politi-
cal terrorism, certain problems
have increased. Is nuclear energy
feasible without a police state?

The Federal government invests
several billion dollars each year on
nuclear development. This year
non-nuclear development jumped
to $70 million. That is a disparity
that indicates the “ecologists"
have not made much impact where
it counts.

I can agree with him only on the
point that conventional plants have
problems, too——namely, air pollu-
tion. Spending "on this
conservation, or solar power’ or
efficiency or population control.
might be wiser and more proﬁt-
able. It is sure that the risks fall in
a different league.

a Deep   ThroatBan

The current discussion about
whether ‘Deep Throat should be
shown has many far-reaching
implications and should not by any
means be dismissed.

Deep Throat has not been
“banned” in this state. The “local
communities” have not made a
moral judgment on this ﬁlm. The
question raised is why this
administration has indeed made a
moral decision concerning the
showing of this ﬁlm?

Money-making for a student
organization should be left entirely
up to that student group. This or
any other administration should not
put on the robes of moral judges for
the sake of a select interest group.
I speak of the alumni.

This is a sensitive issue I'm sure
for the administration because of
its basic economics. Cash flow
from the alumni stops and the
pillars of education crumble. The
alumni can go to hell, as far as I’m
concerned when it meddles with
my school and my time. - Just

, because a “sensitive” issue pops
up all hell breaks loose for the’

image makers.

If it were the administration
only, things wouldn't be so‘ bad,
but it is compounded by the
allocations committee’s actions.
They too aretaking the reins and

decision ‘making processes into;
..  their. gru..bb.y. :har.1;.1s.. =.S.tudv.ent =.f1!l.ldS.'=_,

should be utilized for students
activities. Students should reap
the harvest, as it were. If this type
of policy decision is difﬁcult for
them to make, then possibly a
students’ referendum should de-
cide the question.

ARA has theright, the student
right, to show the ﬁlm; a ﬁlm not
legally deemed as “immoral.” If
anything from this melee is
immoral it is the responses from
Student Government and this
administration neglecting certain
“inalienable rights.” Artistic
expression is being judged by a
handful of ignorant movie goers
who wouldn’t know a good ﬁlm if
they saw one. Deep Throat
certainly isn't the Potemkin of the
seventies, but who am I to tell you

.you can't see it?

law, which allows the President to
control the raises as it is. Nowhere
does it occur to him to ask why the
AFGE is making these demands, so
that one is left with the sense that
once again a “big labor” group is
out to milk the nation and the
public through unreasonable pay
demands.

Ritchcy must live in a deifferent
world than the rest of us; in our
world, the world of people who
depend on wages and salaries, the
biggest “economic gun" aimed at
our lives is the double spectre of

continued inflation and recession
-(stagtlation). Between July 1, 1974
and June 30. 1975. the cost ofliving
in the United States rose an
average of 9.3%. This means that
workers whose pay was increased
by this amount have this year the
same real income or purchasing
power as last. ‘

AFGE members were scheduled
to get an 8.66% pay hike, below the
cost of living increase but still
enough to keep -abreast of it.
President Ford and the . Senate
reduced this to 5% giving them, in

weé1neé.da7y“.Ii.II$:«ic&ernber: 5;? .2-gt-.;sl . ~

effect, a pay cut of 4.3% in their
new contract. ‘ , 1

Assuming he is aware of this cut
at all. 4.3% may not seem like
much to Ritchcy. But for many
families in this country it repre-.
sents the margin between income
and fixed expenses necessary, for
example. .to send a son or a
daughter to college. -

Ritchcy is disturbed that AFGE
has threatened to call on its 300,000
members to vote against President
Ford. Why is it economic
“blackmail" for working people to
press for what is not even a cost of
living pay raise and not “blackmail
when big business gets its way with
higher prices in the White House
and Congress? Does Ritchey think,
for example, that if President Ford
had held oil and gas prices down,

the big energy corporations would

Hyperspace, distant

terms are familiar to the most

how close do they come to reality?

dream up their layman’s course
about the world of frontier physics.

“We decided that science fiction
was a good framework to teach
physics in,” Butler said, forking
beef Stroganoff in the Scaife Hall
cafeteria between classes. “I was
personally fed up with the way
physics was presented in introduc-
tory courses. It’s nothingmore
than a forced march through 300
years of physics, more of a history
course than anything else. ‘

“We wanted a course for people
who have no physics background,
in fact no science background. You
see the physics department is very
large, but there are relatively few
students taking the required
courses outside of majors.”

Butler and Eichen, both science-
ﬁction fans, conceived the idea of a
science-fiction cum real science
course, and almost dropped the
idea immediately, ﬁguring it would
never survive. ,

“First we said ‘oh, wow!’ Then
we said ‘never!’ ” Eichen stated.
“But we talked _to people and it
started to happen. Some profes-
sors thought we were going to be
giving science credits away for
studying green monsters...”

After a recent class, a young

woman was arguing with Eichen
about the possibility of making
people younger, turning back the
'chemical clocks that age people by
taking the human body, disinte-
grating it, reversing the spins and
velocities of the particles and then
reassembling it.’

“Maybe you can’t do it with the

workings of space travel.

One of the instructors for the
course is David Butler, a lean
graduate student 'in physics at Pitt.
What’s he studying?

“Two dimensional solids,” But-
ler said, and grinned wickedly at
the layman’s confusion.

It is precisely the layman’s
confusion and the undergraduate’s
fear of physics that inspired Butler
and his associate, Elliot Eichen, to

whole system,” she said heatedlV.,_

“but you could do it with the
particles.” '

“No, no,” Eichen replied,
shaking his head, “You could
never do it. The probability is
incredible. Given an infinite
amount of time you could reassem-
ble him. But that’s a long, long
time.” '

From there the conversation took
a sudden_turn into philosophy and a
battle over the applicability of the
deterministic theory of history.

Eichen rubbed his curly beard
from time to time and ﬁnally
announced he had to -go to dinner.
The argument continued all the
way to the elevator.

“In my opinion, this course is

. working,” Butler said,.listening.

“The problem with the old style
physics, in fact the way it’s usually
taught, is that there is no room for
enthusiasm or imagination, feeling
that one should not encourage
imagination in the same way one
does not encourage sex.”

"I’ve always felt there was a
connection between science ﬁction
and real science.” Eichen said.
“Right before the Manhattan
Project, there were two groups of
people who understood what
splitting the atom meant: a handful
of nuclear physicists and the
readers of Analog, - a sci-fi
magazine.” .

“In fact, the FBI went to the
editor of Analog when they were
starting the Manhattan Project and
told him to quit printing stories
about it. He was giving away vital
secrets.

“Well,.the editor showed him a

list of Nazi scientists who had
Analog smuggled into Germany.
He said if he stopped publishing
the articles, the Germans would
catch on, so he kept printing them,
and the FBI said OK.”

Butler and Eichen teach two
sections to 43 students, and since
its start in September there have
been almost no drops or withdraw-
als, an amazing track record for a
“physics” course.

.Undoubtedly Physics 89 will be
popping up on time schedules
again next fall, according to Butler.

Back in the cafeteria, Eichen had
a sudden ﬂash, a way of explaining
which is‘ “left”
“right.”

“I know it!” he said, dashing a
diagram on a napkin with a
fountain pen. “It’s simple really.
You just find out what their rotation
is around the Sun with the Dopple
effect and then if...” V

Eichen had snapped his arm up
in excitement, sending a splash of
ink into his left eye.

Butler laughed and handed him
another napkin, and the great
revelation had to wait.

Legal Awareness Ison Your Side

BY KATHRYN KIMBALL

A Pitt student paid a rental
agency $30 for an apartment list,
returned the next week, and found
the office cleaned out. The student
contacted the Legal Awareness
Committee (LAC)———it found the
people and tipped off the District
Attorney.

A woman was ﬁred from her job
at Burger Chef. She consulted
Legal Awareness——it spoke with
the manager, who in turn offered to
rehire her. She refused, but now
holds another position with the
University.

An average of 75 students,
faculty, and University employes
per week seek help from LAC on
problems ranging from theft and
arrest to child support and divorce
questions.

"We're not attorneys so we’re
not allowed to give advice on an
exact course of action,” said LAC
member Jimmy Love. “We can
give alternatives and options.”

The law firm of Weisman,
Swartz, Passaflume and Trimm is
kept on retainer for consultations.

'A lawyer referral service is also

available at a student discount.

LAC is working on a possible
class-action suit against Oakland
landlords.

“We’re in the process of
bringing in complaints and getting
cases together,” said LAC Public
Relations Coordinator Margaret
Masterson. Students with com-
plaints should go to the LAC office
at 306 S.U. with the lease and any
correspondence concerning the
complaint.

“Drugs used to be a main
problem we handled, but people
and that problem have mellowed
out." said LAC representative Tom
Doman. “Now landlords are an
increasing problem.” '

“This month in particular we’ve
had a lot df complaints about

people not getting their security
deposits back," Love added. “The
vast majority of complaints are
about landlords in South Oakland."

“Our highest frustration is from
landlords,” he said. “They’re
shrewd, have money behind them,
and they're not receptive to college
kids. But a number of people have
initiated lawsuits through this
office, so maybe they’ll think twice
before trying the same things again
next year."

LAC is also meeting with the
Housing Office to discuss changing
the University dorm contract.

“There are a number of
inequities we'd like taken out of the
contract," Love said. “There is an
automatic waver allowing students
to be moved out of their» rooms
without choice. That would not be
allowed to happen in a landlord-
tenant situation. but the University

Franklin Pangborn Film Society proudly presents

551'“

FEDERICO
FELLINI'S

gets away with it because it's
automatically in the contract."

It does not happen often, but
“even one student per year is too
much," Love said.

LAC also would like to adapt the '

damage clause in the contract so
that an entire floor is not held
responsible for damage done by
someone who was not caught.

Informal sessions have been held
to have the contract changed for
next year and, according to
Masterson, the Housing Office has
been cooperative so far.

__“LAC and the Campus Police are.
working toward the common goal of
providing for the best interests of
the students," Masterson said.
“Many students don't understand
the extent of the power of the
Campus Police. They are actual
policemen with the power to arrest,
not Pinkcrtons as some campuses

!

have} .

To promote better relationships
between students and the Campus
Police, LAC will sponsor a party
later in the term. At a date to be
announced, students will be able to
attend an informal gathering where
they can talk with and question the
police. '

“We can count on the Campus
Police nine times out of ten to call
us if a student is in trouble before
taking him downtown,” Love said.

“A good relationship with the
police is to the advantage of all of
us, and, they've been very
cooperative,” Masterson said.

LAC has a 24-hour-a-day phone
service. The committee can go to
arraignments, get reduced bail and
provide a defense counsel for
students appearing before the
Campus Judicial Board.

  ‘lmpudent’ Tells Trivia Tale

BY DAVID ASHLEY

The Studio Theatrels presenta-
tion of J.I. Rodale's An lmpudent
Wolf, directed by Mary Beth
Fisher, comes across as a kind of

A Laugh-In version of something akin

to the» trial of Alice in Alice in
Wonderland. Lacking Carroll’s
intellectual cleverness however,

it Rodale has written a potentially

engaging piece of trivia that
becomes more or less entertaining

according to the talent and creative ' E

energy of those involved in its
production.
The script itself is hardly

‘V ._memoi'°able, perhaps with the

exception of having as its basic
comic notion the concept of the
“trial” of a loquacious, positively
Shakespearian Wolf, with the

‘ ‘ plaintiff a little Red Riding Hood

that evidently would feel more at
home in a night club than in a
nursery story. _

Unfortunately, this idea is really

‘about the only example of comic

invention that can be found within
the structure of the play itself.

*Apart from the amusing absurdity

of this opening gambit, the cast,
in delivering the lines Rodale has

' created, has very little with which
to work. '

It is a credit to the director and
cast that the University production
of An lmpudent Wolf is a moderate
success. One individual perform-
ance is little short of brilliant; as for
the others—Tricia Sweeney as a
pouting, lip-wetting Red Riding
Hood. Amy Borteck as the

Granny with highly ambivalent
feelings towards the Wolf, Lance
Ringel as \the delightfully incom-
petent District Attorney, and Joe

smooth-talking but sensitive ani-

give highly creditable perform-
ances. , ’

‘ Who is this Paul Simon who
writes about old lovers, small
towns and baseball?
' A new Simon? Rather an older
one, judging by his new album,
Still Crazy after All These Years.
Simon’s music hasn’t changed
all that much from his days with
Art Garfunkel. Superficially his
music is less serious, sometimes
gospel, sometimes Latin, but the
essence of Simon remains un-
changed. His lyrics still bite, and
though he does little crusading
anymore,he still manages to get in
a few well-measured barbs now
and then. He’s maintained his folk
simplicity and even during times of
brass orheavy strings, he comes
through like a boy singing in the

A ' ‘woods, slingshot in hand and with
. holes in his sneakers. ‘

(two years) follow-up to There Goes

\' ‘ Rhymin’ Simon, an album thought
i by some to be too Top-40.

Simon does an about face on this
one,. every song of which deserves

'  7 ‘FM exposure. = Vi », -

  

 

The title cut sets the mood for
this window-fogger. “Still Crazy
after All These Years” is a tired,
almost down-and-out song about a
guy who just keeps going ’and.
going; why—he doesn’t know, he
just does. Still crazy.

A really good interlude of sax
(everybody’s using ’em these days)
and strings occurs in the middle,
sounding crazed and mixed up at
ﬁrst, but eventually building into‘
the sax’s strength, underscored by
the steadiness of the string section.

“My Little Town,” which, as you
must know by now, is sung with Art
Garfunkel, is probably the most
satiric piece on the album. It also
has the most forceful finish you'll
hear from loner Simon.

Simon can also be genuinely
funny, as he was on’his last album
in “Loves Me Like a Rock” and
“One Man’s Ceiling Is Another
Man’s Floor.” This time “5O Ways
to Leave Your Lover” and “Gone at

. Last” (his hit with Phoebe Snow)

provide all the humor you’re going
to get on this record: “Just slip out
the back, Jack; Make a new plan,
Stan; You don’t need to be coy,
Roy; Just set yourself free.” And
that’s plenty.

“Some Folks’ Lives Roll Easy” is
almost country, but Simon keeps it
out of the fire with some bluesy
sax, a string accompaniment and
the music world's first ﬁnale ever
written for cymbals and drums.

Simon slips in a few digs on
“Have a Good Time”: “So God
bless the goods we was given. And.
God bless the U.S. of A. And God
bless our standard of livin’. And
we’ll all have a good time.” ‘

Hymnal and slow to the point of
solemnity, “Silent Eyes” is the

making only a few errors in
judgment. He is so consistently
funny that if this’ play had any
intrinsic balance‘ne would have to
be criticized for upstaging the other
characters. _
Whether leaning back in his
chair to shoot imaginary aircraft
out of the sky during‘some dull
arguments from the Wolf, sala-
ciously crouching‘ on his desk while
Red Riding Hood is in the witness
box, or shredding law books with
the petulant challenge, “Who says
I can't make a mockery of the
law?" Robinson displays a comic

inventiveness and sense of timing

that is truly outstanding. In fact he

  Bad

“...and a Pina Colada, my friend.”

Steely Dan is a dildo in William Burroughs’ hip classic Naked Lunch.
Most of Dan's fans (as well as most of rock’s so-called underground
literati) are probably unfamiliar with Burroughs’ novel, but that is no
matter. Suffice it to say that it is something worth reading and
something some people would consider “obscene.”

Steely Dan is"‘obscene" only once in a while (“Show Biz Kids”)-
That isn't one of the most dynamic songs Dan has written. It achieved
more than enough undeserved attention from critics who sit and write
but do not listen. It's the show biz kids that Steely Dan ain't.

There has been one American rock band that has encompassed all
the values of our country and at the same time projected new values for
a saddened group of young people to grasp. That group was Buffalo
Springfield. Springfield never received attention and today is as
underrated and overlooked as Dan.

Whereas Springfieldformulated and created a new musical style
(with the advent of Latin rock, “Uno Mundo”; jazz rock, “Everydays”
and country rock, “Kind Woman”) Steely Dan has carried on these
innovations with a much more sophisticated style and
approach...engineering and total songwriting ability.

The team of Fagan and Becker has produced 38 tunes that have
flown over America's head. The lyrics have been either esoteric, so
that most buyers won’t stop to listen, or too complex, so that critics
can't figure them out. There is always the possiblity that they mean
nothing except to Mssrs. Fagan and Becker.

Many of those lines come from College days from Annandale when
these two met. Their interest still lies in jazz, espcially the masters like
Charlie Parker and Coltrane. The more intricate melodic lines with
interwoven harmonies are-Fagan’s doings because of his involvement
with structure. , _

The song that gave Steely Dan a slight push into the business was
“Reeling In the Years.” Most folks remember the ripping guitar solo
that fuzzed out of the car speakers. Interestingly enough, that solo was
pel’f01‘n]@d by a friend, Elliot Randall, who sat in on the sessions. Dan
earned“§i’n early notoriety among the disco army with “Do It Again,” a
song that remains the most despised by many, and I refuse to play it
when I want to hear “Dirty Work” (easily one of the best Dan has
written). . '_

So what does it mean if you can't figure it out in English class? It

means that Steely Dan is the second-best American rock band (next to
Springfield). It means that it is a bunch of geniuses and nobody knows
about them. It means that their lyrics (no matter how _esoteric) are
reaching and poignant in a meaningless world. Steely Dan has made
‘sense to me when -no other Godforsaken act has.
' The helplessness of “Fire Inthe Hole” means much more than any
politico’s ravings about wage-price controls or hiring practices. If not
for Dan's acceptance of the'world as a world and not‘ a forum for
personal exposition, then for the cynical hysterics regarded all too
often as irresponsible by critics.

,Like an adjunct lotus-positioned hvnerbole. “Bodhisattva” is this
generation’s musical Bhagavad Gita. But any spirituality this
generation may realize should be felt soon. It is getting late for all of
us. The energy Steely Dan still exudes is an example for us. The insight
should be closely examined. For this group, Steely Dan is important. It
is good. AS a matter of fact, I have heard rock and roll..-

 

Art Collector Builds Gallery

BY MREA CSORBA

‘‘I want to raise the quality of .

artistic taste among collectors,”
says Michael Berger, who on
weekends opens his home in a
public exhibition of fine art.

I The idea of a weekend gallery
began when friends urged Berger
to share his private art collection
with the public. The first exhibition
was in 1967, at the small Shadyside
apartment the Berger family
occupied at the time.

Since then, the Bergers have
moved to 5820 Howe Street. On
Saturdays and Sundays from 2 to 5
p.m., the 'family’s ante room,
dining and living room serve as a
public art gallery.

A Berger puts together five shows
annually from October to March.
The first showing was an impres-
sive display of the intricate
geometries of Escher. The abstract
realistic drawings and graphics of
Philip Pearlstein carry the middle
weeks while the fall season
concludes with “New (Prints from
Arakawa.” ’ "

Majorilig in business ‘oriented

subjects at Harvard, Berger dis-'

covered his keen interest in art
through the busy‘ social life of his
roommate.

“My roommate’s Saturday mor-
ning art-history class conflicted
with his weekend dates. I audited
the course for him to get the class
notes. Those lectures whetted my
interest in art.”

Later, Berger attended night
school at Pitt for an MFA in art
history. " .

forward like John’ Had/licek, Dr. J‘

and maybe Billie Jean King poised

Spalding at every commercial
interval?

Whenever, however, wherever,
whyever, the day is coming. And
when it does,‘Pitt Coach Jean
Condo will have the Pantherettes
ready to conquer opponents, to
dominate headlines, to be the
counterpart of Wooden’s Alcindor-
ized, Waltonized UCLA.

Admittedly, the Pantherettes are

in. the building stages. The team is i

very young and this year’s
schedule is formidable, pitting the
Pantherettes against some of the
toughest teams in the region.
“We have a very strong
schedule," Condo said, “because

of the participants in the Eastern

 

Regional Championships, which

the Pantherettes will host. And the
inferences, the implications, can
boggle ~ the mind into double
dribbles of excitement.

“The girls are dedicated, very
sacriﬁcial, very coachable,” Condo
said. “We have a very intelligent
squad. They have very good
basketball sense. It's just a matter
of the coach putting it all together
so it's smooth, fluid and devasta-
ting." .

As for the mainstay of the
Pantheretteattack, Condo stresses
defense.

“We believe the whole progres-
sion in basketball is made by the
defense. We're going to use
man-to-man, zone presses; _we
have a press called the Spider that
we'll use this year, and we have
another new onebut it’s secret.”

“We think if we play good
defense, the offense will take care
of itself,” Condo continued.

“This year we're going into a
little more patterned offense, but
we are looking for the fast break if
it's there. We're mainly a running
team.

Condo has two returning vets to
. guide the team. Debbie Jones, an

addition from the volleyball team,

plays center much like Walton did 

in collegiate days.

“She is probably the most agile it

Condo said. “She's tremendously" -

force in a game." _ ‘ " ”

Against West Virginia

Pitt Mounts Stretch Run

BY JIM SPANOS

The Pitt-West Virginia football
rivalry is, well, as old as the hills.
What's unusual about the shootout
that will take place in Morgantown

on Saturday is that more is at stake

this year than has been in the past.

The Panthers are ranked 14th in
the United Press International Poll
this week and hope to be there next
week too, while West. Virginia
would like to regain the Eastern-

    

DENNIS MOORHEAD
power recognition it lost after the
39-0 thrashing at the hands of Penn
State three weeks ago.

One person in the middle of the
affair is safetyman Dennis Moor-
head, a personable individual who,
along with the other 10 defensive
players, would like nothing more
than to stop the Mounties’ offense
as efficiently as they stopped
William and Mary, Duke and
Syracuse this year.

“This late in the season things
are getting interesting,” Moorhead
said. “We can make our season a
great success these next three
games or we can make it a
disastrous one. West Virginia’s
main thing is their offense; they’ve
got real strong running backs, and
if we can stop their running attack
it would suit me just ﬁne.”

Artie Owens is to the Mounties
what Tony Dorsett is to Pitt. He is
averaging a hefty 7.5 yards per
carry this year, and leads the team
in kick returns; Fullbacks
Heywood Smith and Ron Lee pose
another threat to Pitt, and Owens’
backup, Wayne Woods, is also a
competent runner. - WVU is
averaging 370 yards in total offense
per game, running out of the veer.

Head coach Johnny Majors said,

“Hockey” Pucked Over

And here they all come, as the
Yogis head into the stretch run.
With only three remaining in the
contest, it appears to be a four-man
race. Smokin’ Stouffer and the
Grand Wazoo remained tied for the
top spot with 12-3 records this

The most bitter disappointment
of the week was registered by
Gunner Spanos. whose mediocre

“We better be ready.”

Moorhead is -an oddity in‘ the
Panther’s starting lineup—he’s
one of only three seniors on the
defense (Randy Cozens and Tom
Perko are the others). So, for the
third year in a row, Pitt has a
“young” team, and a good
example of that is the defensive
secondary, where Moorhead is the
veteran. Jeff Delaney, Bob Jury,
James Wilson, Jim Farley, Leroy
Felder and Larry Felton have been
shifted to and fro throughout the
year, and keeping track of them is
like finding the whereabouts of

    

your girlfriend when you’re out of _

town.

As a unit, the defense has given
up just 257 yards in total offense
per game, and in this case statistics
don’t lie. Moorhead is second on
the team in tackles (behind
linebacker Arnie Weatherington)
and has played a deciding role in
Pitt’s wins over WVU the last two
years. At Mountaineer Field in
1973, Moorhead had an 80-yard
interception return in the Panthers’
35-7 victory, and last year he and
the rest of the “D” held WVU to

What is Pitt Hockey?

What Is It Doing Here? 

BY STEVE SYBERT

When is a team not a team?
When it’s the Pitt Hockey Club.

Just what is the Pitt Hockey
Club? Well, it is not supported by
the Pitt athletic department, it
offers no scholarships and it does
no recruiting. All it does is win
hockey games.

The Hockey Club will begin its
sixth season of play with the
Second Annual Pitt Invitational
Hockey Tournament on November
29 and 30 at the Civic Arena. It
may be a good idea to be there if
you'd like to see just how far the
“team” has come.

Five years ago", the club’sfaculty
advisor, Dr. Mike Sherman, and
Joe Testa, a former player,
initiated the current hockey pro-
gram at Pitt (there was a team from
1937-39). The club originally
received generous support from
Student Government, but since
that time, the amount of money for
the club has decreased year by
year. Once last season the club
suffered a fate similar to that of the‘
Penguins—bankruptcy. ,

But through hard work and
dedication, the Hockey Club has
bounced back and is preparing for
the most rigorous schedule against
tough Eastern independent compe-
tition.

They were drawn to Pitt because of
its academic reputation, not be-
cause a coach coaxed them to
come.

Several of the players could have
gone to Denver, St. Louis, or
Canadian-border and New England
colleges with full-scale varsity
programs, but chose Pitt because
education came first.

The Hockey Club looks profes-
sional.. As Coach Len Barcalow
says, “They are just like the pros.

You don’t see guys with theiifs —
headgear half on or crooked, and a '

guy with his socks dragging down
around his ankles or his jock
twisted up around his ear. They
look professional even when they
come out.” »

The days are gone when the club
was forced to practice at midnight,
or later, perhaps once a week, or
twice if lucky. This year the team
practices two "afternoons per ‘week
at the Civic Arena and holds a
scrimmage every.Monday night at
the North Park rink.

The schedule is full of formidable
opponents. Penn State, Navy,
Cincinnati, Ohio U., Drexel,.
Carnegie-Mellon, Duquesne and

the others will give Pitt all it cai‘3"’~.
