I Student initiative for a smoke-

free campu

Jessica Iacullo
For The Pitt News

1 As Mick Brennan lit the cigarette dangling

from his lips, he commented on ,a potentially
looming reality: a tobacco—free Pitt campus.
“Ilike being able to smoke on campus,”

. Brennan, a sophomore majoring in informa-

tion science, said. “It’s convenient.”

Student Government Board member
Graeme Meyer, a sophomore majoring in
bioengineering, is pushing a tobacco-free
policy on Pitt’s campus, starting with an on-

’ linesurvey to gauge students’ opinions on

going tobacco—free. The survey has garnered
154 responses since itwent live April 15 on the
Student Government Board website.

In the 19-question survey, Meyer asks if
students would be comfortable with any of
three options: creating designated smoking-
areas, making Pitt completely smoke-free or
banning all tobacco products on campus. The.
survey also asks whether students use tobacco
products, including electronic cigarettes and

other smokeless tobacco products such as I

chewing tobacco. ,

Afcerevaluating student responses, Meyer
will decide which of the options, if any, would
be best to include in a proposal to Pitt admin-
istration. Meyer has not started drafting a

proposal as of April 16.

Meyer said the initiative comes from a

‘health standpoint, particularly the correla-

tion between smoking and lung cancer and
the effects of secondhand smoke.

Meyer is alsoconcerned with upholding
Pitt’s title as one of the healthiestcollege cam-
puses in the country. According to Greatlist.

com, Pitt ranked 12th on the list of healthiest -

colleges in 2012. b
“With such a medically. atttmed commu-
nity, it just doesn’t seem right to not have that

s goes I ive
policy,” Meyer said. I

Meyer’s policy would come in the wake of
Pitt’s failure to make Greatist.com’slist in2013, ’
of the healthiest college'campuse_s, of which

Virginia Techwas the only Atlantic Coast Con-‘ ’

ference school. Greatistcom compiles the list if ,
' using nominationsfrom readers, information if
- ‘on the Internet relating to health services at

schools, student surveys from College Prowler, ’

asite of college reviews'writ,ten‘by students, . 
The Princeton Review and avalue—based scor— . A ’

ing system for’ each school in consideration
forthe list. : '

" Meyersaidheworked closelywithMarian
Vanek, the directér of Student Health Ser— Q
, vices, to assemble the survey, which is cur-

rently aimed at students. Facultymay take

the survey as well, but Meyer -said students:
are the primary concern at this stage in the.
surveying process.. ' I 2 ’ A V

Meyer said the Wellness Committee, a Stu-
dent Governmént Board committee, Student
Health and the Healthy U, a Student Affairs
health initiative, willassist with the distribu-
tion of paper copies of the ‘survey through‘
tabling, ﬂyer distribution and social media.

“We support the ﬁndings of thesurgeon
General that tobacco use in any form, active
and/or passive, is a health hazard,” Vanek said
inanemail. “Thus, we support Graeme and his
team with their efforts to evaluate the poten-
tial ofthe University becomingatobacco-free
living and learning environment?! ' i

_ Meyer said he did notwantto bombard S111-
dents with emails about the survey, butrather,
hopes they will ﬁnd it on the SGB website.

“It has the potential to render them inef-
fective, as peoplebegin to ignore the emails,”
Meyersaid. V -

he said he has not contacted many administra-

determine his next step based on the survey
responses. ‘ d

“When you smoke around other students,
you are subjecting them to secondhand
smoke,” Meyer said. “It’s about respecting
people’s right to clean air.”

Brennan expressed conﬂictingsentiments.

“I don’t think I harm others with second-
hand smoke,” Brennan said. “There’s other
air.”

Meyer said he’s researched many successful
tobacco-free campaigns, including those at
University ofMaryland, Ohio State, University
of Michigan and Michigan State University,
which do not impose harsh punishments, if
any, and said this approach seems more ef-
ﬁcient than strict enforcement policies em-

ployed by other universit1'es.For instance, at

Ohio State University, smoking is prohibited ‘

on all university-owned and operated prop-
erties, and students or faculty who eitness
direct repeat offenders can report them to
their Student Conduct Councils.

Meyer said he is not prepared to make a
ﬁrmstatement on how repeat offenders would
be punished until he has the survey results,
but said that they would likely go through the
University judiciary systemjustlike those who
break other campus rules

For Meyer, the main priority isn’t the A

University’s enforcement but to “promote
awareness _and use peer pressure to enforce
the policy.”

Meyer’s initiative comes at a time when
the University System of Georgia, an organi-
zational body of public institutions of higher
learning in Georgia, will enactaban on smok-
ing, including e-cigarettes. The banwill apply
to all 31 universities in the system and will
begin Oct. 1, 2014.

Advertising is changing. Spelling
out “bologna” and using a cuddly
polar bear to sell soda doesn’t cut
it anymore. Nowadays, if you re-
ally want to sell your product and
attract a large audience, you have
to get creative, and a lot of com-
panies are doing this by jumping
on the social justice bandwagon.

In reaction to these cam-
paigns, a pivotal question has’
emerged: Are the messages of
social justice behind these ad-
vertisements. somehow degraded
because their primary purpose is
to sell us something?

Personally, I don’t think it
matters. I '

Let’s look at Honey Maid.
Honey Maid’s newest ad shows
an array of families -—- including
homosexual couples —— enjoying

graham crackers: Apparently
watching homosexuals eat gra-
ham crackers is really upsetting

' to some people, and Honey Maid

received a slew of angry letters.
Instead of throwing away the hate
mail, Honey Maid hiredtwo local
artists to create a sculpture out of
it that spelled out “love.”

It was a smart move for Honey
Maid. The response cemented
Honey Maid’s status as a progres-
sive, liberal company —— and also

, got its name in the public spot-

light. And the move was low-risk.
Sincenine out of every 10 letters

Honey Maid received were in sup-

port of the company’s original ad,
Honey Maid knew that pushing
its progressive angle even further
would isolate few consumers.
Victoria’s Secret is another
company that recently joined

the social activism brigade with

MC? Camgzus

Modern. advertising: It’s not so bad

its “Pink Loves Consent” adver-
tising campaign. The ads feature

models — all of whom represent '

different races and body types

» — wearing underwear with slo— ‘
gans such as, “No means no” and _

“Consent is sexy.” The website
even goes as far as having a “Then
and Now” page in which Victoria’s
Secret reveals how some of its
underwear used to promote rape
culture. According to the “Pink
Loves Consent” website, Victo-
ria’s Secret previously made un-
derwear sporting slogans like “No
peeking” and “Sure thing,” which
the company now says promotes
rape culture. “

It is social advertising at its
ﬁnest — the key word being ad-
vertising since both companies
are still trying to promote a prod-

uct. But I don’t see that as problematic. The
companies ultimately want to make money
from these campaigns, but their aim for
proﬁt does not diminish the importance of
the messages behind the advertisements.

The ideology of tolerance and open-

ness, which the advertisements address,

requires greater publicity and demands
further discussion. And what better way to
place such ideologies in the spotlight than

to have them touted by big-name brands?

The question of advertising intention
came to the forefront with the video “First
Kiss,” which features 20 strangers meet-

ing for the ﬁrst time and then kissing. The ..

video is ﬁlmed in black and white and set to

depressing, sappy music. The video went

viral almost instantly, gaining nearly 77
million views in just four weeks.

But people became upset when they
realized that the video was all part of a
campaign for Wren clothing, an indie

never tried to hide its involvement with
the advertisement — the video opens with
“Wren presents.” But people were shocked
_ that the video’s primary goal was to sell
clothes using models who play strangers
meeting and kissing for the ﬁrst time.
Does that make the video any less mov-
ing, any less important?
It doesn’t matter why the video was
produced. If people like the message and
‘ ﬁnd it inspiring or emotional, does it mat-
ter what the company’s intent was?
‘Also striking is that people are more

upset with the Wren clothing campaign
than they are with the Honey Maid or Vic-
toria’s Secret campaigns, as though social
issues are allowed to be commercialized,
but romance and love are not.

Advertising campaigns with messages
of social justice force the public to think
and reﬂect upon important issues, and that
is ultimately the most important facet to
take away. Yes, companies aim to make a
proﬁt, but that doesn’t change the impor-
tance behind their messages. I

FormerPitt News EIC prepares

Britnee Meiser
For The Pitt News

Anthony Breznican is widely recognized
as an Entertainment Weekly senior movie
writer and Academy Award reporter, but his
journalistic roots began with The Pitt News
in the late ‘9os. The former editor-in-chief
makes his ﬁction debut in the new coming-
of-age novel “Brutal Youth,” which will be
releasedjune 10. The story focuses on high

' school freshman Peter Davidek as he enters

the corrupt and dangerous environment of
Saint Michael’s Catholic School.

After witnessing an appalling act of vio-
lence on the first day, Peter and his friends

learn to stand up to theiroppressors and nav-

igate their way to survival using unconven— .

tional and entertaining methods. Through

- a combination of thought—provoking action
and dark humor, Breznican epitomizes the
horrors of high school.

The Pitt.News spoke to Breznican in an
email about the challenges of growing up, his
time at Pitt and how to make it as a writer.

The Pitt News: You went to Catholic
school around the same time as protagonist
Peter Davidek. How much of your experience
is reflected in the ﬁctional Saint Michael’s‘?

Anthony Breznican: A lot of my memo-
ries of school and teenage life are reﬂected
here, although, the volume is dialed up on
the dark and demented parts. Growing up

to release debut novel, ‘Brutal

isan ugly, awkward business for everyone.
There are always people willing to elevate
themselves by stepping on your neck. But
what we remember once the dust settles
are the peoplewho reached out and helped
us through. That’s what I drew on — those
vital friends who shielded us when we felt
crushed.

TPN: Peter seems to be a bit of an under-
dog when he ﬁrst signs up for Saint Michael’s.
Why do you think readers will be able to
relate to him? '

AB: He’s this 14-year-old kid who just
wants to slip by under the radar, go unno-
ticed and not make trouble for himself. But
right away, he gets drawn into this crisis at
the school, and that sets off a whole chain

of events for him — good and bad. Now, he
could have laid low, but he felt compelled to
help, to do the right thing.

We all want to do good and stand for

something. I believe most people start out '

that way, and at some point, it gets beaten
out us. Ifwe’re not careful, we go from being
the one willing to run out and help, to the
one pushing over the statues. I think that’s
something anyone can relate to. We all know
what it’s like to feel scared, and the lucky
ones ﬁgure out how to avoid letting that fear
harden into a kind of bitterness. ,
TPN: The cover image is very powerful‘.

Pappas argues that Candida is a true
masterpiece with themes and humor that
transcend its age.

“It’s still funny and exciting because the
subjects he writes about and the arguments
he makes and the jokes he makes still matter
today  [and] are still interesting and funny,”
Pappas said.

Pappas said that Shaw’s development of
Candida’s characteras an intelligent and influ-

considering the time period in which the play

said, referring to her cat who was receiving
almost as much attention from visitors as
McLaughlin’s zany, cartoonish, critter—themed
sculptures and prints. g

One furry collage of a little grey cat sat back

in herworkshop among jars of clay and paints. g

“That’s reaicat hair, you know,” she said,
smiling without looking up from her register
as she ﬁnalized a purchase.

Artists, activists, musicians and the gen-
eral public convened April4on Penn Avenue
in Garﬁeldfor Unblurred, which is held on the
ﬁrst Friday of every month. For more than
a decade, the gallery crawl has showcased

after the event in a phone conversation. “But
it’s a ﬁm time too. Artists are accessible, and
people come up andtalkwith you, which is the

great  hope it carries on this way for a
while.” At one point, rain brieﬂy poured over
the crawl, causing everyone to ﬁnd shelter in

the nearest gallery. Then,-the skies opened up D

to reveal a rainbowperfecﬂy arched across
Penn Avenue that provoked gallerygoers to
dance and celebrate in the street. As much
of a cultural celebration that it is, Unblurred
is more than just an art showcase. Many dif-

“Noah”

Directed by: Darren Aronofsky

Starring: Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly,
Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins

Grade: C-

If you had told me in 2006that “The
Fountain” wouldn’t end up being Darren

Aronofsky’s worst movie, I’d have assumed ‘a

you hadn’t seen it.

But alas, in 2014, Aronofsky gives that
stunningly overblown passion project a run
for its money with another one — the de-
cidedly secular biblical adaptation “Noah.”

Much of the conversation surrounding
the ﬁlm has been obsessed with the cre-
ative liberties taken in adapting its sacred
source material. But for a piece of narrative
and ﬁlmmaking, accuracy and efficacy are
not always congruous. Aronofsky never

pretends to attach any type of a “based on

a true story” tag to “Noah,” so the differ-
ences are forgivable, but the bland action,
excess and narrative ineptitude are not.

Just like the ﬂood he portrays, Aronof-
sky’s “Noah” is a disaster — a $130 million
disaster.

The story’s a simple one. Maybe you’ve
heard it? Noah (Russell Crowe) has a series
of visions from “the Creator” (Aronofsky’s
spin on “He—_Who—Must—Not—Be—Named”),
signalingthe apocalypse through‘ an earth-
ly water main break. To prepare, Noah
and his family build a wooden cruise ship
for a’ co—ed pair of every living creature
on Earth. a

All the while, Tubal-cain (Ray Win— l

stone), who brutally killed Noah’s father
when he was a boy, rallies up an army
to attack Noah and his family. When the
ﬂood eventually strikes, it sweeps all of
Tubal-cain’s army away save Tubal—cain,
who sneaks onto the ark. Noah predictably
devolves into a state of madness, as most
alpha—male authority ﬁgures do during the
apocalypse, and threatens his own fam-

ily when they disobey the Creator. Your ‘

Sunday school teacher might have left out
those details."

Above all else, “Noah” is another gar-
gantuan—budget..action ﬂick with a lot on

‘Noah’: Darren Aronofsky’s $130 million disaster  

its mind, which is a recipefor disaster
more often than not. Aronofsky‘isn’t subtle
about his messages: the corruption of man,
environmentalism, preserving resources
as well as a possible nod to veganism all
take center stage. But very little of this

navel—gazing can amount to much when_
s giant, rock,-encrusted angels are stomping
’ around the earth. :

For ,.all of his high—art ambitions,
Aronofsky ultimately falls into thergenre

trappings of other massive action tent.
; poles. The rock—encrusted angels, or
“Watchers,” bear a similar stature, de-

structiveness and badly written dialogue

‘ to those CGI robot cars. For all his auteurf

ism, Aronofsky ﬁlms his action scenes just
like the next guy, with copious amounts of
chaos, destruction andnoise. They can be
a mind—numbing blur, which makes the
moments of astonishing beauty seem like
even more of a letdown. A

In the midst of all the pandemonium,
“Noah” makes room for some captivating
sequences, as we’ve come to expect from
all Aronofsky joints. Noah tells his children
the story of creation, Adam and Eve and

V Cain and Abel, accompanied by a gorgeous
,andpoff—ki1ter full-CGI visual of the stories.
‘Aronofskyeven sn-eaks in some gorgeous

accelerated documentary—style footage

. of water spreading throughout the earth,

along with a POV shot from the ﬂood’s

ﬁrst raindrop as it falls onto Crowe’s face. a

And somehow, thecharactergdrama in
“Noah,” which has been one of Aronofsky’s

strong suits in the past, falls remarkably ,

ﬂat. Before the ﬂood, we’re treated to some
laughable scenes with Noah’s grandfather,
Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins): Hopkins’
Methuselah plays up the wise and nebulous
old man trope to the verge of parody, par-
ticularly during a moment whenhe blesses

* Noah’s pseudo daughter~in—law (Emma
_Watson) with the power to conceive.

Methuselah’s blessing inevitably leads
to some inner—fami1y'turmoil‘on the ark

with a furious Noah, who doesn’t quite .

approve of,intervening.with the divine.
And in the ﬁlm’s ﬁnal act, Aronofsky puts
some of the message-making on hold for
several scenes of extensive melodrama.

Offense again proved to be a problem for
the Panthers baseball team, which only
managed two hits in a loss at Kent State,
as Pitt was unable to capitalize on starter
Casey Roche’s longest outing of the season.

The Golden Flashes (23-12, 9-3 Mid-

American) did not allow the Panthers a hit -

after the ﬁrst inning as both hits coming
in the top half of the ﬁrst frame, providing
Pitt starter Roche with no run support in
the loss at Olga Mural Field at Schoonover

Stadium.

The 4-1 loss marks another tough out-
ing for the Panthers because of their in-
ability to score runs when they need them.
Of Pitt’s nine losses in April, seven include
games where Pitt’s offense could not put
more than two runs on the board, includ-
ing last night’s game against Kent State.
With the loss, Pitt’s road record has now
dwindled to 6-13 this season, and the team
is now mired in a six-game losing skid’.

afternoon bundled up in heavy coats and
winter hats. The weather has been indica-
tive of Pitt’s play as of late: cold, having
now lost seven games in a row after drop-
ping both games to the visiting Seminoles.

The Panthers knew they faced an uphill
battle taking on the eighth—ranked team
in the country in a doubleheader, but they
were not prepared for Seminole shortstop
sensation Maddie O’Brien, who ﬁnished
with two home runs and seven RBI in the
two-game sweep of the Panthers.

the‘ Panthers’ bats seemed alive and well,
forcing Kent State pitcher Michael Clark
to throw 46 pitches in his fourth start of
the season.

Senior Stephen Vranka led off the

CC). Spirits ran high in the home team’s
dugout as it kept the pressure on early,
having at least one runner in scoring po-
sition in each of the ﬁrst three innings.

Even Pitt starting pitcher Alexa Larkin
dealt a quick six-pitch third inning, con-
tinuing the scoreless tie. She was throwing
at all areas of the plate, keeping batters
guessing and working out of jams.

“We made decent adjustments at the
plate, and the pitching staff showed im-
provement,” said head coach Holly Aprile.

However, O’Brien hit a solo home run

' in the top of the fourth to jump out to a 1-0

lead,,erasing Larkin’s early success. From
that point, Florida State’s play started to
heat up, and the team didn’t turn back. ‘

At the beginning of the ﬁfth inning,
Florida State added another run and
grabbed a 2-0 lead. The Panthers re-
sponded quickly in the bottom half with
a Tori N irschl single to left ﬁeld, scoring

game with a double to left ﬁeld, giving the
Panthers some life. After a sacriﬁce bunt
by outﬁelder Boo Vazquez a_n_cla walk to

starting pitcher Roche, Vranka eventually‘

crossed home plate for the ﬁrst run of the

II off upset of No.8

junior ﬁrst baseman Carly Thea all the way
from‘ﬁrst base on a ﬁelding error, making

"the score“2-1.

Junior pitcher Savannah King came in

- relief at the start of the sixth inning and

was very effective, shutting out the.Semi-‘
noles by only surrendering one hit until
O’Brien belted her second home run of the
game and 20th of the year, increasing the
Panthers’ deﬁcit to 5-1.

In the end, Pitt was only able to add
one more score courtesy of Thea, and the

valiant effort ended with Pitt suffering a’

5-2 loss.

The Panthers gave Florida State pitcher '

Lacey Waldrop all she could handle in her
complete game victory. Waldrop moved
to 27-4 on the season after pitching seven
innings of one-run ball. Larkin was pinned
with the loss for Pitt, dropping her record
to 6-8.

his record to 2-1. ' I

Pitt struck out 10 times and left nine
runner_s stranded on base. They did not
advance a runner to third base after the
ﬁfth inning. ' . _ ‘

Vazquez spoke about the team’s recent
struggles at the plate.

“We have to. be consistent in having

quality. at-bats,” Vazquez said. “If we hit
balls hard, good thingsqwill happen.”
Wednesday’s loss is the Panthers’ ninth
in.their last 10 games, dropping them to a

ond inning, only to face a red-hot O’Brien.
She cashed in with a three—run double,
giving her seven RBI for the day and a 3-0
lead for the visiting team.

Pitt battled back in the bottom of the
second with two runs of its own. Kaila Ba-
latgek scored by a Florida State throwing
error, and the next batter, Jordan Fannin,
slapped a double down the third base line
to trim Florida State’s lead to 3-2.

Once the top of the third inning began,
Pitt seemed to run out of steam. What
began as hopes for redemption was soon
muddled by a long ﬁnish to the afternoon.

Florida State cruised to another vic-
tory, scoring seven more times to win 10-3.

out nine in ﬁve innings of work.

Ashlee Sills’ RBI single to left ﬁeld in
the sixth provided the only scoring play for
the Panthers beyond the second inning.

Consequently,» Pitt increased its losing
streakto seven games and recorded its.
14th loss in ACC play.

The obvious standout of the afternoon
was O’Brien, whom the Panthers wanted
no part of as the second game lingered
on. The Panthers intentionally walked
her four times in game two after hitting
for a perfect batting average on the day
and smashing two home runs.

Pitt will look to bounce back this Friday
and Saturday when it hosts Georgia Tech
for a three-game series. I

right now, and we are working to get
through it,”]ordano said. “We have to get
our conﬁdence back and play through it.”

Roche provided the sole bright spot
for Pitt in the game, tossing a solid four
innings in a losing effort, giving up two
runs (one earned), three hits and one walk
on 57 pitches.

Roche’s two runs came in the fourth ’

. inning after Zarley Zalewski reached base
on an error by Pitt shortstop Dylan Wol-
sonovich. Kent State ﬁrst baseman Cody
Koch promptly smacked an RBI double
down the left ﬁeld line, bringing Zalewski
home on the play.JeffRevesz added an RBI

’.

single of his own. Kent State tacked on two

more runs before the game’s end.
There’s no telling when the Panthers

will get back into the winning column, but

T they have a golden opportunity to do so at

home this weekend against 20th—ranked
Clemson in a three-game series with ACC
implications. ~ _ .

Senior pitcher Matt Wotherspoon,
much like the rest of the Panthers, is look-
ing forward to coming back to Pittsburgh.

“I think we’re comfortable athome,”
said Wotherspoon. “If we play hard, we
will put ourselves in a good position to
win the series.” V

The Panthers and Tigers will face off in
the ﬁrst game of a three-game set Friday
at 6:00 p.m. at Charles L. Cost Field in the
Petersen Sports Complex. I
