headed by Alan Papernick, Col.
’59; Bert O’Malley, Col. ’59; Denis
Lichtman, Col. ’59; and Bob Bar-
rickman, Col. ’58; is to ac-
quaint the, incoming male stu-
dents with the Pitt fraternity sys-
tem.

Under the rushing rules adopted
by the IF Council, no prospective
rushee may enter a fraternity
house during informal rushing;

i however, he may meet fraternity .

representatives. on campus.

Any violation of this rule will
be handled by the IF Judicial
Commission for a decision, and
thento Dean Biddle for appro-
priate action.

The» period of formal rushing
will begin at 8:30 a.m. Monday,‘
Sept. 30. Formal rushing will con-
tinue through Saturday, Oct. 13.
During formal rushing, the rushes
may attend as many different.fra-
ternity events as possible in order
to get an overall picture of fra-
ternity life at Pitt.

The bidding will follow form-

, al rushing, and bid cards .will be

in the Dean of Men’s oﬁice
Monday, Oct. 14 and Tuesday,
Oct. 15. A . ,,
Any upper classman whose
name does not appear on the
freshman‘ rushing list and who
wishes to be rushed should contact
Mr. Roy King in the Dean of Men’s

' ofﬁce.

Dr. Quick Heads
Set-Up Work On
Student Calendarf

A formidable problem as a

school of Pitt’s scope and size

is scheduling of events ac-
cording to retired Registrar
Dr. J, G. Quickuwhopis in
charge of a University calen-

dar which will "include “major”
student events, as well as func-
tions of other segments in the Uni-
versity. . A
A pro-tem committee has been
established to keep “up—to-date”
and, to certain extent, to regulate
the student calendar. Dr. Quick,
Dr.. William Swartzbaugh of the
Student Union, and Mrs. Virginia
Mllgan and Jack Hardman from
Dean of ,Women’s and Men’s Of-
ﬁces respectvely are the Univer-
sity staff members. ’
Student representatives are
John Strauch, Dick Mattern, Al
Berman, Kyra Mock, and Kent
Jarrell of the Congress Com-
mttee system and Millard Am-
dur of the Pitt News.
Eight events were considered
by the committee so important
that the period during which they
are to be held will be termned
“protective” indicating that no
student organization may schedule
an event at the same time. A list-
ing of these is as follows:
Dedication of Student Union-
Tuesday, October 8, 3 to 5
p.m.

Fall -Convocation-—Tuesday, Oc-
tober 22, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Homecoming Dance——Saturday,

November 2, evening.
Pittsburgh Symphonetta—-

from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. every day.

Problem Solving

Placement Service.

If there is sufficient demand,
meetings other than those men-
tioned below will be scheduled at
different hours to accommodate
students who are unable toattend
these meetings‘ because of class
conﬂicts.

A Companies’ To Visit

All students who will receive
degrees in 1958 are invited to use
the University Placement Service
in -ﬁnding their career positions.
Hundreds of companies will visit
the campus this Fall «and Spring
to interview prospective grad-
uates.

It is recommended all those
approaching graduation be reg-
istered with the Plaﬁement
Service, regardless of their
post-graduation plans. The

Thursday November 7, 8:30
to 11 p.m.
Christmas Ball'—— Friday,
cem'°ber 20, 8 to 12 p.m.
Honors Convocation—Wednes-
day, April 16, 11 to l p.m.
Tap Day—Wednesday, May 7,
afternoon. "
Spring Festival Dance—Satur-
day, May 10, 8 to 12 p.m.

In addition to these “protective”
dates, it is hoped that the ﬁfth
hour during which the “Mid-Day
Series” will take place, will serve
very limited use for organization-
al meetings and activities. All
events to be scheduled for the
Union must be cleared with Dr.
Swartzbaugh first and then with
Mrs. Milligan or Mr. Hardman.

Social events must, as usal, be
registered in the Dean of Wom-
en’s Office. The Pitt News will
feature this year a weekly calen-
dar of events important to under-

De-

graduate students.

   

Placement Service To Present
Employment Briefing Sessions

A series of placement brieﬁng sessions has been sched-
uled in order to inform students concerning the Placement
Service and the subject of employment in general.

All students who will receive degrees in 1958 are urged

to attend one of these meetings. Brieﬁngs will be conducted

by Dr. Paul M. Sherwood or Mr. Walter Ritgnour of the
.. .

Placement Service almost regu-
larly receives requests for in-
‘formation about graduates who
are looking for positions.

It is easier for all students to
register before graduation, have
credentials on ﬁle, and be pre-
pared to use the Placement Serv-
ice if the necessity arises.

/Schedule Listed

The brieﬁing session schedule is
as follows:

Place——University Counseling
Service Library, Room 205
Schenley Hall. Time——for all
Senior Engineering, Science and
Math Majors graduating in Feb-
ruary, June or August, 1958:

October 4—10 a.m. and 2 p.m.

beneﬁt of evening school students
and alumni. The office will be
open on Saturday mornings by

location of the placement bureau
is on the second ﬂoor of Schenley
Hall.

CAFETERIA

Cafeteria congestion could be
eleviated if those students
whose schedules Permit would
go to lunch before 11:30 a.m.
or after 12:30 p.m. Cafeteria
hours are 11: a.m. to 1:30 p.m.

 

days when Men’s Conference
meant dinks, Pitt ties, and hazing,
according to Dr. Swarts.

He stated that Pitt recognizes
the problems that confront the in--
coming student. A scientiﬁc.ap—
-proach will be presented to solve
academic, social, and personal
problems. The techniques will aid
freshmen in getting 0 to a good
start in their academic and social
life at Pitt.

This year instruction will be
given in problem solving. Learn-
ing how to recognize a problem
and how to cope with it will be a
prime objective. This is a tech-
nique for getting answers to prob-
lems which have not arisen before.

Test scores received during
orientation week will be evalu-
ated in terms of each student.

The results of these will help

the instructor and student to

form a plan of study.

Instruction in how to take and

. pass objective and essay tests will

be covered thoroughly. This is an
important factor as many high
schools have omitted the essay
test from its curriculum.
Activities Evaluated

- There will be a complete,break-
down of all extra-curricular ac-
tivities... The evaluation of each in
terms of which are the most
proﬁtable both academically and
socially for the student will be
made.

A representative from each
department will outline the re-
sponsibility of student and in-
structor. This will include what
is expected of the student and
what the department expects of
him in terms of tests and home-
work.

The Placement Bureau will
point out career opportunities,
the advantage being that the stu-
dent will be more able to aim his

Men’s Conferences

Take In New Topics

Under the sponsorship of Men’s Council and Dr. Donald
E. Swarts, Men’s Conference is moving into new ﬁelds. Ten
instructors assisted by 35 student counselors are conducting
35 Men’s Conference sessions a week.

The purpose of Men’s Conference is to help the student
become well rounded in his studies and social life. This pro-
gram is a vast change from theﬁ

\

course of study to the demands of
a,_ career.

Dr. Swarts ‘said that this year
Men’s Conference is geared to the
end of higher caliber freshmen.
With this forward thinking it will
help Pitt graduates to cope wth
the many comple problems of a
complex age.

Members of SC

Attend Retreat
For Fall Termi

Student Congress held its
1957 Fall Retreat at Camp
Karondowanna on Sept. .21-
22. The program for this
event was planned «by John
Strauch, Col. ’60, social chair-
man of Congress, with the help of

,Jark Hardman, Dean of ‘Men’s ad-

visor. -

Phil Parkinson, president
0 Congress, in his opening
remarks stressed the importance
of co—operation and a united front
in coping with the problems of
Student Government. He added
that vice—president Jan Swensen,
Col. ’59, would serve as co—ordi-
nator of the committee system.

Congress members were re-
freshed on their purpose and re-
sponsibilities to the various seg-
ments of the University family.
The group was addressed by Dr.

William Swartzbaugh, Director of”

the Student Union, Saturday eve-

ning. He discussed in his speech

the possible evolution of student
government and its eventual rela-
tionship to the Student Union
Board.
Government Discussed

It became obvious to the Con-
gress members that the Union
Board would mushroom beyond
all expectations. Swartzbaugh,dis-
cussed details which appeared
hazy in the proposed plan for a
University of Pittsburgh Student
Government Association. The

question of whether student gov- ~

ernment should have the power of
the budget to certain groups was
hashed. ,
An informal dance contrib-
uted to further uniﬁcation of
the group. On Sunday morning,
Chaplain Luccock provided in-
spiration to the group with a.
sermon on the individual’s in-
ﬂuence on others during his
lifetime and its great signiﬁ-
cance from biblical times to the
present. After a brief recrea-
tional period with intermittent
rain, Congress committee heads
reported on summer progress.
Appointments chairman, How-
ard Rossen, Col. ’58, announced
appointment of PittiChest chair-
man, Gene Klein, Bus. Ad. ’59,
and Student Discount, Adam
Sommerstein, Col. ’59. The student
discount program, Rossen stated,
has been temporarily discontinued
due to lack of response on the
part of students holding cards.
The new chairman will attempt to
determine why the program failed
and how it might eventually be
reinstated.

importance of returning books on

  Eliminate Ute Negative

L A Men’s Conference has long been considered by some
as time—wasting and by others as priceless. Now the C115-
pute can be resolved. A ‘V V

A new outlook adopted by these counselling and edu-
cational programs is oneiof .meaty, practical 1nstruct1on.1n
the arts of learning, The techniques of success are being
taught. ‘

Not only are the student—administration teams show-
ing the freshmen the obvious technical skills and handi-
crafts for success incollege life, they are also giving some
rudimentary principles and fundamental patterns for logi-
cal thinking in any.future endeavors of the freshmen.

The new program is faster—paced and much more valu-
able than former tie—selling campaigns. The Freshmen are
expected to react with more vigor to this high caliber orien-
tation. Those who fail to take advantage of these instruc-
tions will undoubtedly assume a back seat to their class-
mates throughout their college careers. The back seat may
even be ejected in the newly accelerated academic life at
Pitt.

The practice of selective admissions will show its merit
in theacceptaince of this new program. Never before has
the University chosen with such care the huddled masses
beside its golden door. Not all the students were guaran-
teed to last through four years of college life but they were
in a much better position to do so than those who pre-
ceded them. A

Now the test will come under ﬁre. There is a rough
road ahead for that old Pitt reliable, the one-pointed, With-
drawn, and Incomplete student. After all, this is the age
of the well—rounded, projected, and total man.

Trimester Trial

By GORDON CLOWNEY

At a recent press luncheon Chancellor Litch-
field expressed his hope of having the new tri-
mester program in effect by next September.

This program, whichlhas been mentioned by
the Chancellor several times since his arrival at
Pitt last year, would consist of three terms of 15
weeks each. If adopted, the plan, - ' ' ' 
would enable a student to earn hi
degree in less than three years,_
instead of the four that it now;
takes. ‘ /

As an optional program, thi
could be very welcome indeed t
the student who wishes to get hi
schooling out of the way in

hurry and enter his vocatio
than is now possible. . ,,

It would also be a money saver to the Univer-
sity because greater use could be obtained from

  
   
  
  
 

 

. the.,classrooms and other facilities by’ their pro-

longed use. ,

On the other hand,” there are many students
who, for various reasons will not be able to, or
will not want to avail themselves of this plan of
study.

Time To Work

Lack of money would be the largest single
factor to dissuade a student from taking advan-
tage of the accelerated program. As it is now,
most students take advantage of the long ‘sum-

_ mer vacation to work and earn all or part of their

tuitionifor the following year.

By going to school 45 weeks out of the year,
one would hardly have enough time to work and
replenish dwindling resources each year. Dr. Litch-
ﬁeld has stated that loans would be mad?) avail-
able to those students who ﬁnd the ﬁnancial bur-
den»too diiﬁcult. The loans would be paid back
over a period of years after the individual gradu-

 

     

“It would be far better,” the Chancellor said,
“for the student to forego those months of summer
work at low rates of compensation, to borrow the
money from loan funds established for the pur-
pose, and to merge into the professional world
several years earlier, and thus invest the time he
has saved in work at appreciably higher rates of
return.” i

However, if any sizeable number of students’
wereto adopt the trimaster idea, and rely, as most
of‘ them probably would, on borrowing money,
from the University, would there be enough in
the “till” to accommodate everyone? The program
could not function without the support of a large
number of students, since it would not be worth

the trouble and expense to operate the third term 7-

if full advantage were not taken of it.’

Starting In Debt

‘A student entering under the trimester plan,’

and not receiving help from home, scholarship aid,
or, and the new regime seems to frown upon this,

A working part time, would be hopelessly in debt »

when he graduated and began earning a living.
It’s debatable whether ‘this is worth the advantag

of starting a year or so earlier. a
Another thing that may limit the number of

studentsattempting to tackle the year round pro-

gram would be the constant drudgery of attending
school, full time, for 45 weeks a year. It would
take quite a bit of stayingspower to attend classes
for almost three years without the beneﬁt of a
sizeable vacation somewhere along the line.

Most students seem to appreciate the long break ,

each summer. It not only gives a- person the op- ’*

portunity to earn money, but also to take a break‘
from the long mental grind, and be ready to work
when school opens again in the fall.

S0 What itrseems to bpil down to is _“you pays
your money you takes your choice.” From some
it will be good, for others it probably will be bet-

Shirt Cuff Comments

Overset

By JIM MARINO

Every so often in the course
of human events an accumula-
tion of odds and ends are gath-
ered into an editor’s drawer and,
although each is deserving of
some comment, none of these
tidbits are worthy of lengthy dis-
course by itself. .»

In newspaper terms, the left-
over type that piles up at the
compositor’s stone or worktable
as the pages of a newspaper are
set into their respective forms,
is called overset. This column,
then, is an accumulation of im-
portant but brief facts which
never ﬁt otherwise in the paper.

‘First of all, the orchids of suc-
cess should be presented to
those who worked to make
Freshman Week the inspiring
success that it was. Dr. Cath-
erine Allen, a very recent ad-
dition to the Pitt family, wast-
ed no/time in organizing what
was undoubtedly the best—at-
tended Freshman Mixer that
ever was»held at Pitt.

No less successful was the
Herculean effort by Dr. William
Swartzbaugh, director of the

deserved elaboration, this year’s
Freshman class may be consid-
ered the best received in the
University’s history.

The,Kickoff Dance was also
an unexpectedly well-attended
affair. A spirit was seen glow-
ing in the usually ﬁshbelly—pale
Pitt crowd. Even in the dust
cloud atmosphere of the Field
House something seemed to
mold’ the group into an un-
typical oneness.

Under conditions less favor-
able than those of the modern
and comfortable Union, the
Men’s Banquet came off in an-
other show of unusual spirit and
warmth. The lofty and unbeliev-
ably stifling banquet room in
Soldiers Memorial became a
place of interest and inspiration.
The program was stimulating.
The food was mediocre, but no-
body paid much attention or, if
they did, they mercifully waived
comment.

So the freshmen attended and
listened and learned and gen-
erally made an excellent ac-
counting of himself during the
week. But at the contest between
Oklahoma and Pitt on Saturday
the older members of this in-
stitution showed an equally poor
interest and more typically apa-
thetic attitude.

group, has set the. pace for
cheering at football games. So
much so that when they were
moved from the student section
two years ago reaction ran high
and they Were soon returned to
their place of prominence in the
student section.

L But on Saturday a new crowd
faced the playing ﬁeld. A sneer-
ing, sarcastic group who spoke
in jeering tones and loudly
criticized where before they had
cheered. The example spread
through the stands until all
cheering stopped and once again
the great rock of cold indiffer-
ence sat upon the fans. No sound
of cheer or warmth was heard
through three long losing aquar-
ters of the game. The ﬁne old

tradition of trolley-borne apathy .

was carried into Pitt once again.

The spark-plug of life and
noise in the student section A-
Block ‘P’ —— was like a mosaic
tombstone reading clearly, “Here
Lies The Great New Store-
Bought Rebirth of Pitt. Dead
Before Reborn.”

It is heartening to know that
eventually, through really fresh
stimulation from the residence
halls this campus life may be
revived at least for several
years. The rapid organization
and original ideas of
groups will soon replace the old-
er thinking which has merely

_ shown itself to be increasingly

fruitless in recent years.

Editor’s note: This is the sec-
ond ofpthree articles about the
recent tour of the Pitt Players’
production of “Brigadoon” to
U.S. Air Bases in the Azores,
Iceland, and Bermuda.

By ROSALIE GLAND
Behind them glittered the

  light of Maine, before them

lay nothing but . dark and
e\mpty ocean, as the Pitt Play-
ers and their advisorsl wing-
ed their way north to Ice-
land on a Military Air Transport

. plane.

A brief stop was made at the
Harmon ‘Air Base in Newfound-
land where the thermometer read
38 degrees, a sharp contrast to the
110 degrees they had endured at
lV'cGuire Air Base, New Jersey a
few hours before. ,

At 11:00 p.m. they took off on
the longest leg of their ﬂight.

Continuous Daylight

“At midnight we saw the sun
setting on the left side of the
plane, and, at the same time ris-
ing on the right,” reﬂected Michael
McHale, director of the Pitt Play-
ers. "‘From then on until we re-
turned to McGuire six days later,
we saw no night, no ~‘arkness——
just continuous daylight. It was
the most fantastic thing I have
ever seen.”

Nine hours later the southern
loomed in the
distance — a moss—colored rock
surrounded by black ocean.

, “Arriving behind schedule, we

were escorted to the air base at
Keﬂavik by ﬁghter planes,” Mr.
Msﬂale remarked. “Keﬂavik is
a rather large base and the city
is the second largest in Iceland.

All the Players were impressed
by the clearness and coolness of
the atmosphere. The countryside
was, on the whole, barren and
without vegetation.

Greeted Warmly

“We were greeted very warmly
servicemen of all three
branches,” Mr. McHale comment-
ed. He especially expressed ap-
preciation for the kind attention of
Major Thomas Duggon, personnel
ofﬁcer. _

During their six day stay the
troupe put on four performances

‘in an unusually ﬁne service club

with a completely equipped stage.
The audiences numbered between
1200 and 1500 men each perform-

“The servicemen were most re-
ceptive,” commented Betty Chi-

appetta, Ed. ’58. “We were treated
like royal guests.” ‘

Betty added that it was amazing
how hungry the men were for
news of home. “It’s a great feeling
to know we’ve really made them
happy.”

The Air base at Keﬂavik is the
transport depot and stopover for
all ﬁights between Europe and
North America.

Mr. Mcﬂaleitermed the Ice-
landdefense system amazing. He
noted that three branches of our
armed forces, the Army, Navy,
and Air Force, as well as the
Strategic Air Command con-
stitute a tremendous network of
defense. , .

“Iceland is ready,” he sum-
marized, ‘Not even a row boat
can come in if not authorized.

Visit Station

Some of the Players spent a day

at the Rockville Radar Center, an

isolated defense statior located
on barren rock land several miles
from the base. There they were
privileged to watch our radar
system at work tracking down
planes and detecting their alti-
tudes.

The Azorian government
frowns upon U.S. personnel fra-
ternizing with the natives. The
Players noticed that the Ice-
landers, though polite, were

. cool and impersonal.

June 17 is Iceland I" dependence
Day. Miss Margaret Covert, chap-
erone for the group and Fred
Horn, Engr. ’58, chose this day
for a ‘trip to Reykjavik, the capital
of Iceland, ﬁfteen miles from the
base.

‘FOOTBALL THROUGH THE AGES

The football frenzy is upon us. But let us in the midst
of this pandemonium call time. Let us pause for a moment
of tranquil reflection. What is this great American game
called football? What is its history? Its origins?

First_of all, to call football an American game is some-
what misleading. True, the game is now played almost
exclusively in America, but it comes to us from a land
far away and a civilization long dead.

Football was first played in ancient Rome. Introduced
by Julius Caesar, it became one of the most popular
R_oma.n sports by the time of Nero’s reign. The eminent
historian, Sigafoos, reports a crowd of MMCLDDXVIII
people at the Colosseum one Saturday afternoon to see
the Christians play the Lions.

_ With the decline of the Roman empire, football fell
into disuse. The barbaric Huns and Visigoths preferred
canasta. Not until the ﬁfteenth century A. D. did foot-
ball emerge from its twilight and rise to its rightful place
in the ﬁrmament of European sports.

Which brings us to September 29, 1442, a date dear to
the hearts of all football fans. It was on this date, accord-
ing to the eminent historian Sigafoos, that a sixteen-yeah
old lad named Christopher Columbus tried out for the
football team at Genoa Tech. He failed to make the team
because he was too light. (He weighed at the time only
twelve pounds.)

And why, you ask, is this date-September 29, l442—

so dear to the hearts of all football fans‘? Because young r

Columbus was ‘so heartbroken at not making the team
that he ran away to sea. And if that hadn’t happened,
he never would have discovered America. And if Columbus
hadn’t discovered America, the world would never have
discovered tobacco. And if the world hadn’t discovered
tobacco, football fans never would have discovered
Marlboro-——which, as every fan knows, is the perfect com-
panion to football. And why shouldn’t it be? Look what
Marlboro’s got . . . Filter . . . Flavor . . . F1ip—top Box . . .
Eon can’t buy a better smoke. You can’t smoke a better
uy.

The end of football in Europe came with the notorious

“Black Sox Scandal” of 1587, in which Ed Machiavelli,

one of the Pisa mob, paid off the University of Heidelberg -

Sabres to throw the championship game to the Chartres
A. and M. Gophers. It was a mortal blowto football on
the continent. ‘

But the game took hold in the American colonies and
thrived as it had never thrived before. Which brings us
to another date that remains evergreen in the hearts of
football lovers: December 16, 1773.

On. that date a British packet loaded with tea sailed
into Boston harbor. The colonies had long been smarting
under the English king’s tax on tea. “Taxation without
representation,” they called it, and feelings ran high.

When on December 16, 1773, the British ship docked
at Boston, a semi—pro football team called the Nonpareil
Tigers, coached by Samuel (Swifty) Adams, was scrim-
niaging near the harbor. “Come, lads,” cried Swifty, see-
mg the ship. “Let’s dump the tea in the ocean !”

With many a laugh and cheer the Nonpareil Tigers
followed Swifty aboard and proceeded to dump the
cargo overboard in a wild, disorganized and aba.ndoned
manner. “Here now!” called Swifty sharply. “That’s no
way to dump tea overboard. Let’s get into some kind
of formation.”

Andthat, fans, is how the tea formation was born.

  Panthers Need Win Over DUCkSi5

Gridders F ace
Strong Ducks

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

One swallow has never made a
summer and accordingly, one
game rarely symbolizes a season.
With that thought uppermost in
their minds the Pitt Panther foot-
ballers travel to the Far West this
week for the first of two games
against Paciﬁc Coast Conference
foes.

The University of Oregon will
be the Blue and Gold foe on Sat-
urday night in Portland. The
game will be played at Mult-
nomah Stadium and the ﬁrst head
bumping will occur about 10:00
p.m. (Pittsburgh time). Southern
Cal will bethe foe a week later.

The Panthers will be out to win
their second game in as many
years from the Ducks. Last sea-
son, the locals pulled out a— 14-7
decision at the Stadium. Ex—Pan—
ther boss Len Casanova again
will direct the wing—T speedsters,
with hopes of evening the score.
End coach Ernie Heﬁerle scouted
the opposition in their. victory
over Idaho by a 9-6 count.

“They impressed me more de-
fensively than offensively,” com-
mented the observer. “They have
good team speed and excellent
backs.” Coach Hefferle also add-
ed, “They have backs that can
go all the way. They are deﬁnitely
better than last year and could
win the Paciﬁc Coast title.”
Sooners Show Mid-Season Form

Physically the Jungle Cats are
in good condition for the upcom-
ing fray. The team will concen-
trate on stopping the Oregonians
running attack and the campaign
to strengthen the second team will
continue as before. Today is the
last afternoon of practice at home
as the team will ﬂy to the coast to-
morrow morning. Final drill will
take place at the playing site.

Last Saturday saw the fear-
some Red and White of Okla-
homa University extend their
record winning streak to 41
games at the stadium. Scoring
once in the second quarter and
thrice in the third, Bud Wilkin-
son’s Sooners marched to a con-
vincing’ 26-0 triump. Displaying
“mid-season form,” to use
Pitt Coach John Michelson’s
words, the visitors moved re-

lentlessly to their win via land

and air.

.All-American halfback Clendon
Thomas was the game's leading
ground gainer with 86 yards and
he picked up a T.D. to boot. Four
out of eleven attempted passes
were good for 78 yards and the
other three scores. The third
Sooner weapon was the oft- neg-
lected quick kick which Thomas
used to striking advantage.

Bowen Shines On Defense

Coach Michelson cited the Ok-
lahomans speed as the biggest fac-
tor in their Saturday conquest.
ii. addition the ﬂuidity of their
unlookedfor multiple offense was
a surprise. The head man agrees
with his assistant Hefferle that
the Blue and Gold will have to
guard against the same speed
when Oregon takes the ﬁeld on
Saturday.

Bright spots for the Jungle
Cats last Saturday were the
kcking and defensive work of
Dick Bowen, the running of Bob
Stark, and the pass catching of
end Art Gob. ~

The colorful spectacle on the

BemismenAwait Opener

  After Three Weeks Drill

A feeling of optimism prevails at Kennard Field where
Coach Leo Bemis is preparing his 1957 edition of the Panther
Booters. Even though ten lettermen are returning along
with an All—American, Bemis still will not predict a better
record than last year’s 3-5-1. “We’ll have a better team this
year, but playing a tougher schedule means we ,may not

have a better record,”

. Bemis.

Adding to Bemis’ worries is the.
early beginning of the Soccer
schedule. This year the Booters
open up a week earlier against
Akron University at the Akron
Rubber Bowl. This Saturday’s tilt
will be the opener of the soccer-
football doubleheader. Akron and
Muskingham will tangle in the
football ﬁnale.

The tension of the tough sched-
ule may be somewhat eased by
the return of last year’s All-
American and this year’s team
captain Jerry Bressanelli. Along
with Bressanelli will be the teams
leading goal getter last season,
Sam Hazou.

Giving these double letter win-
ners ample support will be one
year veterans Bill Eisinger, Ron
Goga, Jack Horox, Dick Hopkins,
Charles Kane, and Bob Sadosky.

player in high school is most like-

Ducks Seek Revenge
On Softened Panthers

By MURRAY CHASS ,

Len Casanova, the coach who could not win with the
Panther eleven of 1950 and who has since been out in Eugene,
Ore., with the Oregon Webfoots, will have a half and half
team ready for the Panthers this Saturday night at Portland.

Fortunately for Casanova,

could possibly offset the poorer half. His better half hap-O
pens to be the backfield, whch$ i

one of the halves is good and

includes seven lettermen.

Strangely enough, three of
these backs will be working on
their third letter in football for
the Webfoots (all English instruc-
tors please excuse—that”s what
the book says).

And going still further, the half-
back and fullback of ths group
hold the number one and two
spots in ground gaining totals in
the Paciﬁc Coast Conference for
the past two seasons.

The halfback is Jim Shan-
ley, who is a light, 170 pounds
and is only 5 feet, 8 inches off
the ground. His taller and heav-
ier line-bucking mate is Jack
Morris. Together, Shanley and
Morris have rushed for a. total
of 2184 yards in 1955 and 1956.
The first of those two years, in-
cidentally, was the first on the
varsity for this talented pair.

The other fellow who has two
letters to his credit is Quarter-
back Jack Crabtree. Crabtree is

ﬁnally getting his chance at the

starting signal—calling spot after
acting as understudy to another
Crabtree, Tom, for two seasons.’

Mondale After Fourth Letter

The fourth player in Casanova's
better half will be Charlie Tour-
ville, a junior. Tourville, another
small boy at 167 pounds and 5
feet, 9 nches, doesn’t qualify for
the‘ two-letter clique. But then
again, he’s only a junior.

As for Casanova’s other half,-
there are a few bright spots in
it. One of these is Guard Harry
Mondale, 5 feet, 6 inches, 198
pounds. Mondale probably holds
the distinction of being the lone
gridder in the country to have
already garnered three letters.

0n'the showing or rather no-showing of the Panthers.

Everyone that saw, heard, or read about the game was concern-
ed with what happened to the Panther offense, defense, and speed
that Coach John Michelosen was supposed to have this season.

Against Oklahoma it never materialized. In fact, most fans
at the game were wondering whether or not they had their dates
and places mixed and weren’t really watching a dummy scrim-

’ . mage practice. The offense never got started. The backs were

held tight at the line of scrimmage and could only get credit
for a total of 86 yards at the ﬁnal gun. ' ’
Then too the question arises as to whether or not the Jungle
Cats should have opened up their offense earlier in the game. Ok-
lahoma, expecting a‘ power offense, prepped their defense in that
direction and were able to thwart almost every line play.
Many, local fans are now beginning to doubt whether or not

‘the grid prognostacaters know what they are talkingiabout when
they‘ chose the Panthers between eight and ﬁfteen in the Nation
‘during pre—season ratings.

But you have to take into considerationlthe past record of
the Oaklanders. The Panthers have been known as a come back
team. For the past two years the Panthers" have come back after
a few bad games to accept bids to the Sugar and Gator Bowls.

‘ Before the Jungle Cats can hope to repeat, they will have to
prove them selves against such improved teams as Oregon, Southern
California, Notre Dame, Army, and of course arch-rival Penn State.

‘Freshmen Drill  ~
At Trees*Field

Coach Steve Petro’s freshmen—
37 in all--began drills in earnest
Tuesday for another rugged four . '
game schedule. As’ before the
team will use Trees Field for
their practice sessions.

The opening tilt will be against
arch-rival Penn State on October
19 at the Nittany Lion’s den. This
gives Petro four weeks in which
to round his squad into playing
condition. C

This year’s team is one of the
biggest as well as one of the heav-
iest since the l953 freshmen squad
which saw Darrell Lewis, Corny
Salvaterra, and Bob Pollock as
team members just to mention a
few. A
Some of the freshmen shaping
up are Jim Cunningham, Jack
Kreider, Bob La Rue, Pat Mor-
sillo, John Sakal, Ed Schrockrnan.

There’s a growing suspicion
around the News office this
week that Editor Jim Marino
has been studying the football
dope charts again. How else can
campus grid experts explain the
mysterious eight for nine record
which the famous indoors
sportsman hung up in the ﬁrst
week’s Yogi Poll?

Perhaps a “Samson” story in
reverse is at the root of the cur-
rent Marino Miracle. Mgrino’s
crew cut had grown to the sin-
ful length of three ﬁfths of an
inch last week, but he happen-
ed to pick the games before he
had that “load taken off his
mind.” This week, back down to

1. Uniform grading: you get exactly the blackness
you want. . . from every pencil, every time.

2. Proven needle-point strength for line after
long line of unchanging width.

3. Proven smoothness——thanks to Eagle's exclusive

The Coe Kohawks, now fa-

The not—so—fearless forecast-

closed guesses. Determined D.R.

.i -Only Diet.-zgen Slide Rules
have these great features

Professional engineers say’ Dietz’gen's new slide rules.
embody the greatest advances in design in more than B
a quarter century. Dietzgen's exclusive Micromotic
Adjustment permits perfect alignment of the scales at
all times. Simple resetting of one screw does it. The
end plolesmeed not be loosened; fit and action oflho
slide is never disturbed. , C

Dletzgen's automatic slide tension insures perfect
slide action wherever and whenever these rules are
used. Slides cannot bind or stick-—nor become loose
so errors may result from accidental slide movement.‘
These are truly great slide rules. Important new scales
added. New super-safe carrying case. See them at
