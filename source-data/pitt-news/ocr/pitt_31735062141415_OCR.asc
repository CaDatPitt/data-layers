Women Recall Old Custont
With Impressive Ceremony

A weaving line of light from Thaw
Hall grounds to the top of Univer-
sity Drive and down the steps to
Heinz House , on Wednesday night
marked the yearly renewal of one of
Pitt's earliest traditions for women——-
Lantern Night, with more than 400
lanterns carried by white-clad fresh-
men women and’ their big sisters. It

- was a far cry from the short night-

gowned procession which ﬁrst wound
its way from the Linharathome at the
top of the drive long before Heinz
House was built. , .

The program presented on Wednes-

day is- an elaboration of the script,

composed ‘by Margaret Messer, presi-
dent of  S. G. A‘.-, nearly a decade
ago, who, with the help of Dean Amos,
changed the old,hazlng'cu,stom of es-

conting freshmen in long-sleeved night
gowns and old-fashioned night caps
on a trail over the university grounds,
into an impressive ceremony with its
lanterns now symbolic of the light
which guides through darkness into
wisdom.

The speech by Pa Pitt. welcoming‘
the freshmen into Pitt life, which was
read by Genevieve Blatt, chief justice
of Senior Court, and Alma. Mater’s
explanation of Pitt Ideals, read by
Rose Marie Demestichas, president -of
W, S. G. A., have been kept almost
verbatim from the manuscript of Miss
Messer, who was graduated in 1924,

ities record in her class and with the. A

Given University’s
Pledge Action

Objectors Ask Reasons

 

Student Council [today was on rec-
ord as being opposed to the actions
of a campus minority and the “news-
paper sensationalism” which followed
the introduction -of the University's

‘loyalty pledge int-o registration pro-

cedure.

Voicing its approval of a statement
presented by President Reed Rose,
Dent. ’33, Tuesday night, Council up-
held the action of the University and
denied that there was any strong rad-
ical group on the Pitt campus.

. Meanwhile a group of eight stu-
dents. members of the Pittsburgh
branch of the National Students’
League, and the League for Industrial
Democracy met privately also_ Tues-
day night and drew up a‘pet,ition;re-.
questing Chancellor ‘Bowman to make
a public declaration explaining the
meaning of the pledge.

-‘ The text of Rose's statement, which

was presented to a downtown report-
er who attended the meeting, is as
follows:

“In the past few days an effort has

been In,a,d§e> by local newspapers to

capitalize on the news’va1"u’e‘of”a “big
story” concerning thepledge signed
by students at registration. .

“The article and the editorial in to-
day’s issue of the Pitt Weekly express-
the opinion of the students. Most cer-
tainly the situation has been a case
of smoke without ﬁre. ~

“As I view the situation it is an
individual matter which became
closed after the student signed the
pledg’e, or did not sign it.

“The absurdity of the idea of a_
strong radical group among Pitt stu-
dents is shown by the small percent-
age of four out of 7,000! students so
much as questioning why they should‘
sign the pledge. The pledge was
drawn up to establish this fact.

“Such proof demonstrates that the
so-called disturbance was due to a
minority action on the campus com-
bined with newspaper sensationalism
and does not represent student
opinion.” 3

Copies of the protesting __ petition
were said to be in circulation -0-n the
campus and it was indicated that they
would be presented to the Chancellor
Monday. In three citations dealing
with the pledge the petition. protests
the vagueness of the words “purpose
and regulations of the University of
Pittsburgh,” asserts that the wording
of the pledge is so -extreme it could
not ‘be "taken conscientiously by any
state or congressional legislator, and
alleges that the pledge is out of har-
mony with the purposes of a. liberal
university. ‘

Mountaineers Hope to
    Meet   Pitt Eleven On
Even Terms Tomorrow

By FRANK L. Bowman, JR.,
Sports Editor of the West Virginia Athenaeum.

I

Morgantown, W. Va., September 28.———The 1932 edition of Coach
Earle “Greasy” Neale’s Mountaineer football team is, despite the
3—O setback it received last Friday night from Duquesne University,

. a powerful aggregation.

“ This year’s Mountaineer team has suﬁered the loss of-seven
lettermen from last season, including Capt. Johnny. Doyle, quarter-
back; Leo Dotson, fullback; Jake Subulsky, halfback; Lawrence

'0 Belle and Ike Lewis, tackles; Leland?

Brown, guard, and Bob Hamilton, end.
The new — combination is being
formed around the nucleus of nine
lettermen, who returned to school,
plus the stars of last year’s -freshman
team. The most notable of thesoph-
omores is Eck Allen, who will carry
the 7weight as ‘ﬁeld general for -the
' "Mountaineers " during the season.
Allen has the ability to mix his plays
and is also] an exceptionally -good man
ar. passing, and running the ball.
It‘  Backs Plentiful

Coach Neale has chosen him..as the

‘fblocking halfback” to carry most of
the rough work on his shoulders.

State, was a sensation in the practice

a very poor account of himself as a

night last Friday and_ most likely

‘game. If he does not play as ‘expected

‘an above-the-average kicker.

. V Lineup Uncertain.-

Except for a... few old reliable vet;
erans most of the players did not
know at any time whether or not
their positions were secure» until
Coach Neale announced the lineup for
the opening game with Duquesne. A
question. mark has been hovering over
all positions on the team, and many

of them are not settled yet. 1

At this time the lineup for the_Pitt
game has not been selected, but the"
following backﬁeld men and the fol-
lowing line is the most probable start-
ing combination:

Sortet and Goodwin, ends; Vargo
and Schweitzer, tackles; Zirbs and
Anderson, -guard-s; fschwartzwalder,
center; with Slate, Allen, Canich and
Marker in the backﬁeld.

West Virginia, as usual, will enter
the Pitt-Mountaineer game as the un-,
derdogs this _ Saturday, and most of'
the football fans here still keep a lit-c
tle ray of hope burning, wishing that’
some day, perhaps this year, the;
Mountaineers will “take over” the
Pitt Panthers.

Panthers Leave For
W. Va. Today

When WestVirginia wins a football
game, that’s news for Morgantown,
but when -West Virginia happens to
beat Pitt,.the football season for the
Mountaineers is regarded as a howl-
ing success. e . ,

One obstaclehas stood in the.-path
of the Mountaineers having a suc-

‘cessful season by? beating Pitt, and

that is the fact that Pitt has usually
proven much too good for‘ “Greasy”
Neale’s lads, Tomorrow afternoon,

Neale gets another "chance to defeat! »

the Panthers, and despite some of. the
best publicity that has come . from
Morgantown in many a moon, the real
money will be on the Panthers, with

. few takers. , —

Both teams have played but one
game’ apiece this season, and West
Virginia's showing against the Dukes,
as‘ compared with Pitts. showing
‘against Ohio Northern points to a
Panther victory by at least two touch-
downs. . ' _

Pitt’s starting lineup is still uncer-
tain, and may not be known till game
time. However, the b-a'ckeld‘of Reider,
Heller, Hogan, and Weinstocki are
sure starters. Tormey will again see
that the ball goes where it's called
for. ’

Skladany will be paired off’ at end
with either Daily or Wojcihovski,
while Hoel, Hartwig and. Ormiston
ﬁght it out for -the two tackle positions.
Onder and Cuba are almost certain.
starters at the guard posts. 0

Faced by the possibility of being.
stopped by the beefy Mountaineer
line, Pitt is likely to throw more
passes than has been their custom in
their past games at Mountaineer field.
The student body, and the cash cus-
tomers are likely to see the. Heller
to Reider touchdown, pass Worked ‘at’
least once, and the Heller to Skladany
skit may go over ‘big when least ex-
pected”. In‘ ‘addition, Mountaineer
fans can stop to ﬁgure that Reider
also throws passes.

A large squad will leave the Sta-
dium today at four o'clock, thirty-ﬁve
footballers making up the party. In

addition to those mentioned above,

Cutri, Nicksik, Sebastian, O’Dell, Mun-
gas, Matesic, Weisenbaugh, Luch,
Timmons, Rocker, Meredith, Love,
Se-iffert, Oleojnicksak, Seigel, Katz,
Stark, Shotwell, Valenti, and Wilkins,
and Rocker will make the trip. Coach

': Themerit of a plan to provide a Student Union organization and,
- eventually, some kind of a building where undergraduates might RS-
sociate‘ in their leisure time, should bring the whole-hearted support
‘ of-the student body. Already the College ‘Association. and representa_-
tives of other activities sponsoring dances throughout the year have.
 indicated their willingness to get behind the movement.
l_'. * Its immediate beneﬁt—that of Providing a ‘series of dances at a.

low, uniform price-—is enough in itself to enthuse the ﬁnancially de-
pressed undergraduate. _ The additional beneﬁt to the student body of
 a* Student» Union “building”,cannot be questioned. But whenand

where the building?

IT IS going to be difficult for many undergraduate men students
who do not live in Pittsburgh to obtain even part—time employment -in
‘ « the city this year. A large number of these students are wholly de-
pendent uponarrangements which will enable them to earn their liv-
ing.‘ One way University peoplecan help these boys is to take them
intd their'homes and give them" either or both room and board in
_- x,cl1_a_i1g§_for services,rendered~. The urgency for this kind of help
_s great.’ Members of the faculty can further aid such a plan by
calling it to the attention of their friends outside the University.
The employment Bureau for Men will act as a clearing house. - Tele-
