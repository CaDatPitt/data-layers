This country was founded on
some of the greatest principles of
the world~ freedom, justice and
the pursuit of happiness. It was
also founded on genocide,
hypocrisy, war and defeat.

This is the greatest country on
the face of the Earth. It is full of
unused libraries.

This is the richest country on
the planet Earth. It is full of
hungry people.

These are just three of the many
contradictions found in today's
world, Pulitzer prize—winning
playwright August Wilson said
Thursday at Pitt’s Honor’s
Convocation.

Wilson, a Pittsburgh native
whose poems and plays depict
African-American life, was
awarded an honorary doctorate
in humanities by Pitt Chancellor
J. Dennis O'Connor at the
convocation. But his response
wasn’t a speech espousing the
virtues of a higher education.
Wilson instead urged the
audience of honorees and their
families to leave the “old school

politics of business as usual.”
“The question you have to ask
yourself, and particularly you,

the best and the brightest," Wilson ~s

said, “is whether you are going to

become a victim of society.”
Society, he said, is full of

contradictions that can no longer

be- ignored. He used the Statue of

Liberty as an example:

“We have a huge statue sitting
in the harbor of New York,”
Wilson said. “It says, ‘Give me
your tired, yours:-I-poor~, -your
huddled masses yearning to be

es to effect change

free.’ If we don’t mean it, take it
down. Change the sign. ‘Give me
your tired, your poor, your
huddled masses — except
Haitians, except Mexicans, except
Poles.”

Nowhere are the contradictions
more evident than in relations
between whites and blacks,
Wilson said.

“I do not stand here and say
that we African Americans are
victims, but rather that we both,
black and white, are victims of
our history," he said. “And our
victimization leaves us staring at
each other across a great divide
of economics and privilege that
each year, each decade, widens
into a gulf.”

“We are tired of bleeding,”
Wilson said of African Americans.
He cited recent incidents in New
York City and Howard Beach as
examples of attitudes that are
becoming increasingly popular
in conservative America.

The 30 million poverty— stricken
people of African descent in this
country demand accounting,
Wilson said.

City Council member Jim Ferlo has ascended

from the dust of the demolished Syria Mosque to '

head a crusade designating Oakland a historic
district.

A staunch advocate for the preservation of the
Syria Mosque, Ferlo has made a proposal that
would hinder the demolition of any other historic
buildings in Oakland.

In a preliminary council vote last Wednesday, the
vote was 6-1 in favor with two abstentions, including
council President Jack Wagner.

The final vote will be cast on Tuesday, and Ferlo
said he feels he will again have the council’s
support. ‘

“Out of the ashes and destruction of the Syria
Mosque has arisen an important preservation issue,”
Ferlo said. “The demolition of the Mosque exposed
the fact that we are irresponsible concerning

institutions [like the Mosque]. Nothing is sacred.,
and we want to preserve and protect our institutions.”

The Mosque was destroyed by National
Development Corporation so that Pitt could construct
a new medical building.

“We applaud the university for all it does, but we
just can’t roll over and let it do what it wants,” Ferlo
said. “I’d like to see Pitt expand in underdeveloped
areas. ldon’t want to see offices where the Mosque
was.”

Aside from helping to enhance the Oakland
community, Ferlo cited two major reasons that
motivated his quest to preserve historical
buildings.

“We will never again have the opportunity to
amass the architects, engineers or capital that was
present at the turn of the century, when buildings
such as the Mosque were built,” Ferlo said.
“Secondly, those types of building materials don’t
exist anymore in our society. This got me to rethink

Heart disease is reversible and
disease-causing plaques that form
in coronary arteries can go away,
according to Dr. Nead Barnard.

Barnard, author of The Power

_ of Your Plate, and president of

The Physicians Committee for
Responsible Medicine, spoke
Saturday at the annual Vegetarian
Taste-Fest, sponsored by Animal
Advocates.

The Taste-Fest featured eight
meat—, egg- and dairy—free entrees,
as well as various desserts. Booths

sponsored by groups such as the
Mobilization for Animals and the
East End Food Co-op sold t-
shirts, food products and cruelty-
free beauty and cleaning
products.

At least 600 people attended
the event.

Barnard spoke about the, role
of diet in heartdisease and cancer.

“The problem is that heart
attacks occur 4,000 times a day in
this country, and a woman dies
of breast cancer every twelve
minutes," he said. “These things
are diet related and doctors have
not been using the tools that they

ought to to impact on them.”

Heart disease is the No. 1 killer
of American adults, but Barnard
said he believes that doctors have
not tried to really solve the
problem.

“I believe that constitutes
national malpractice, because
there are things that people can
do to take power into their own
hands, to change their risk of the
leading killers in America today,”
he said. i

Cholesterol and saturated fat
are the primary causes of heart
disease in the U.S., he said.

BiGALA sponsors awareness Week CORRECTION

The Pitt News encourages its readers to

9- Educating and making the

community more aware of issues
facing gay students is the major
goal of this week’s bisexual, gay
and lesbian awareness days,
members of Pitt’s Bisexual, Gay
and Lesbian Alliance said.
“We’re very excited about all
the events; we worked really hard
to put this together and we feel
we did a good job and our efforts
will pay off,” Todd Kinavey, co-
president of BiGALA said.
Awareness week is not a
National Coming Out Day, it is a

..special'annual week that Pitt's

BiGALA group organizes to
address gay, lesbian and bisexual
issues specifically related to Pitt’s
campus.

The highlight of the week is
featured speaker l)r. Marjorie l lill,
director of the office for the
Lesbian and Gay Community for
Mayor l)inkins in New York City.
She will be speaking Wednesday

at 8 p.m. in the WPU Ballroom.

Hill, who has been involved in
many areas of politics, plans to
address race, gender, sexual
orientation and how people can
work together to achieve common
goals, Linda Jarrett, co-president
of BiGALA, said. '

On Monday, Tuesday and
Thursday the club will be staffing
an information table on the
ground floor of the union which
will have pamphlets and
information regarding a variety
oftopics such as family, women’s
and human rights issues, as well
as other areas of interest. They
will also have petitions for people
to sign on different topics each
day.

Safer sex workshops will be
conducted by The Pittsburgh
AIDS Task Force for both men
and women on Tuesday at 7:30
p.m. in the WPU.

‘‘I hope all the people come to
the safer sex workshops. The
workshops are for both men and
women and are not broken down

for specific sexual orientations.
Everyone is welcome. They will
try to address the concerns for
the audience that is there,”
Kinavey said.

The week wraps up with a
panel discussion regarding
discrimination at Pitt.
Representatives from Affirmative
Action, theJudicial Board, Office
of Residence Life and Office of
Student Affairs will be in
attendance to direct students’
questions and concerns to the
offices that can assist them if they
are discriminated against or
harassed.

Also on Thursday, regional
representatives for the 1992 March
On Washington will be guest
speakers.

Following the week of events,
BiGAlA will be restructuring their
weekly events so that they can
better serve the needs of the
lesbian, gay and bisexual
community, Kinavey said.

“We are restructuring because
we want to make sure we do

serve as a social, educational and
support group, as well as political
group. We’ve been very active in
politics this semester, and we
want to let students who may not
be interested in politics know we
have a lot to provide for them as
well,” Jarrett said.

On Monday nights they will be
having rap groups for men.

“These are informal groups
where new members can learn
about BiGALA and discuss issues
of coming out,” Kinavey said.

Tuesday night’s rap groups for
women will be held at 7:30 p.m.,
with similar content.

“We’ve found that often times a
person who is just coming out or
dealing with problems feels more
comfortable talking with
somebody of the same gender
and that’s why we hold two
sessions,” Kinavey said.

Wednesdays will be a
discussion topic which will be
decided on beforehand and will
be advertised so anyone who

Program celebrates the arts

By Donna Pesansky
Staff Writer

Faculty and students from the
arts and sciences departments
joined together on Saturday to
present a “Celebration of the Arts"
festival for alumni. _

“The purpose of the day was to
give alumni an alternative
to the football and basketball
games, to bring them back to
campus and tell them about
various departments within the
arts and sciences, with the main
focus on the arts,” Rebecca
Micheals, director of
development for the arts and
sciences, said.

The day’s activities included
musical compositions from
students and faculty,

, presentations on artists in today’s

society and scenes from plays
written by Pitt students.

There were also all-day exhibits
sponsored by the English,

music and theatre arts
departments. Over 140 alumni
participated.

One of the favorites of the day,
according to Edward Foote, an

alumni since 1931, was a speech
by Lee Gutkind, a professor in
the English department. Gutkind
discussed the story of medicine
framed in the life and death drama
of real people.

Foote’s wife, Mary, said,
“It really brought tears to my
eyes.”

The last presentation of the day
included a scene from Union
Station, a play written by Pitt
student Marta Effinger, winner of
the 1991 American College
Theatre Festival’s Lorraine
Hansberry Playwriting Award.
Efﬁnger discussed the making of
the play and how it was a product
of her imagination, not a real-life
story.

“People always assume that
I’m one of the characters,” Efﬁnger
said.

She stressed the importance of
creativity and imagination. The
scene, put on by actors from the
Kuntu Repertory Theatre, was
about a non-biological family
living together and trying to reach
different goals by combining their
resources. .

SGB trains student leaders

By Julie Sabol

Asst. News Editor

Helping student groups function more
effectively in the university and showing them
better organizational techniques were the main
goals of the Student Government Board-
sponsored Leadership Conference held this
Saturday.

“It benefits the university when student groups
run smoothly and this conference helps them to
do that,” said Bryan Bender, SGB board member
and coordinator of the conference.

The conference was open to all student groups

who wanted to attend. It featured a variety of
workshops that addressed the various needs of
student organizations. Twenty—five
representatives from various campus groups
had registered to attend.

The sessions dealt with topics including group
motivation, planning, inter-organizational
cooperation, recruitment, assertiveness, publicity,
communication and how to conduct an effective
meeting.

Many of the students who attended currently
hold or will be holding leadership positions in
their organizations next year. They said they felt
the conference would help them to improve
their group. ,

“I hope to gain some new insights into the
basic problems that any organization has to deal
with,” said Sean McClearn, the vice—president of
University Democrats.

After completing a full day of workshops,
students appeared satisﬁed with the conference
overall. 0

“You realize you aren’t the only club with
problems and you aren’t the only club with
successes. I probably learned more from the
other group's experiences and how they solved
their problems than from what the facilitators
had to say,” Dina Scardamalia, president of the
Resident Student Association said.

A major downfall of the conference was the
lack of people who attended, according to the
students.

“The idea behind it is great, but the benefit
enhances as the more groups get involved with
the project. If others knew what content was
offered, more groups would have sent
representatives,” said Anthoney Moody, the
founder of the newly formed Roteract chapter
on campus.

“I thought the sessions went well, it could
have been a better turnout, but it was still
worthwhile. I’m sure all the participants gained
some things they can take back to their groups,”
Bender said.

said.

He added that the “university should
be a model of society, not a reflection.”
When meeting with suidents, Harmon
said he often takes time out to ask
them questions about who they are
and what they are doing.

He said he not only wants to know
what needs to be done to help improve
their years at Pitt, but likes to get to
know students on a personal level.

“I like to know about students.
Sometimes when they come in, I'll just
talk with them, even though we might
not have any official topic to discuss,”
Harmon said.

When looking‘ toward the future,
Harmon would like to see the union of housing and
resident life, Resident life concerns the living conditions
of the on-campus students and housing deals with the
changing of light bulbs and cleaning.

Harmon also oversees the operation of the cafeterias.
And on occasion will eat at the Towers, where he
described the food as pretty good.

He , said the reason so many students dislike the
cafeteria is because, “when you eat 2-3 times 8. day, it gets
tiring. Familiarity breeds contempt.”

When he is not working, he is either spending time
with his wife Beverly, who works at the Learning

Once a year, Dr. William Harmon,
vice-chancellor of studentaffairs,slam  
dunks a basketball. ' 

“And not with one of those baskets  ~
that are lowered, either,” said Harmon,
who attended Johnson C. Smith
University on a basketball scholar- /
ship.

While in college, Harmon was also 
on the Student Government Board 
and secretary of the first-year-student
orientation group, which was
considered to be the most powerful

, group on campus.

He says that he was a non-traditional
student and that may have been the
reason ‘why he was so successful in
college.

Before attending JSU, Harmon served four years as a
pilot in the Air Force in Viemam. He said this taught him
to be a little bit more mature focus.

Harmon is in charge of the counseling center, resident
life, student activities, student health, international services,
food services, learning skills center and housing.

His job concerns are making a student’s years at Pitt as
enjoyable as possible. I

But with many types of students with different
needs, Harmon said it can be hard to please
everyone.

“Pitt has a very diverse student population. It attempts
to respond to their needs. Where we get into the
perception of being non—responsive is when the responses
are not what the students want. In some instances, a non-
response might be just the same as a response. A classic
example is what happened in the Pre-Law Society.

not going back to Europe. We are both here to stay.
We are both settlers.”

Wilson urged the audience to question their
futures.

“What are you going to do when it’s your turn to
sit on the boards of hospitals and the art museums?
What kind of education are you going to have when
it’s your turn to run the universities?” he asked.

“We suffer from a failure of the imagination,” he
said. “This is still an enormously wealthy country

and meaningful ways of life for all its citizens. We
have the means, all we need is the will.”

Wilson ended his speech with a bitter order to the
audience: “It’s your life. Go live it.”

Before Wilson’s speech, over 400 students were
honored for scholarship and leadership in the
university. Provost Donald Henderson presented
the undergraduate academic honorees, saying, “You
will provide inspiration for those who will be ‘
honored in the future. This is a day of celebration for
the entire extended university community.”

Kristen Zagst, a Chancellor’s scholar, university
scholar and winner of the Emma Locke award,
responded for the academic honorees, comparing
the university to a castle, “In which we search for
jewels of knowledge to attain wisdom. We, as
beneficiaries, must create new rooms to explore in
this castle.”

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Monday, March 23, 1992

By Heather York
Sta_ﬁ"IVr1'ter

Jack White earned degrees from N otre
Dame, the University of Alabama,
Kansas State College-Fort Hays, Utah
State University and the University of
Georgia.

Of course they all bear titles like
Doctor of Poolology, Master of Billiard
Science and Bachelor of Billiards, but
he won’t say that part.

He will say, though, that he earned
$17 million playing pool last year —
“more than the president earned
illegally.”

And he says his ‘pool cue — the one
he keeps in a case engraved with “Jack
White, Internationally Famous Pocket
Billiard and Trick Shot Artist — is
worth $12,000.

The “self—proclaimed, registered
pervert” displayed his pool-playing
talent in the William Pitt Union’s
recreation room on Thursday between
jokes and jabs at his opponents.

“I have attained perfection,” White
said, “and I promise that if anyone
beats me here I will pay $100 to every
person on this campus.” Minutes after
the promise was ‘made in front of
nearly 100 onlookers, White lost a
game to Jeff Jones, one of Pitt’s best

‘ pocket billiards players.

“He cheated,” White said.

.White has been playing. pool since
he was 8, growing up in the ghettos of
New York City, he said.

His father played pool, and his uncle

. was a world champion.When he was a

kid, he says, he practiced pool eight

Pool pro shows off tricks

hours a day, seven days a week. Now
that he’s a professional, he lives in
Beverly Hills, where he says the gate to
his estate is 3 1/2 hours from his front
doon

He doesn’t practice anymore; he
doesn’t even own a pool table.

“What would I practice? Missing?” he
asked. “I can’t get any better.” ,

White, who’s high run in pocket
billiards is 519, is the only professional
billiards player to have entertained at
the White House. He takes his show to
over 200 colleges and military bases a
year, and he is also a professional
instructor.

He’s been to Pitt many times before,
and when he comes back he says he
always sees the same people.

“I just know no one graduates from
this university,” he said.

“He’s rude and crude, even if he is a
great pool player,” said senior Dave
Miller.

“Go on,” White said, mopping his
brow with a $1,000 bill he pulled out of
his suit pocket. “I’m rich. You can’t hurt
my feelings.”

In between jokes White showed off
his talent and gave a few lessons. “Lesson
1 is how to control cue balls and abuse
your opponent,” he said. “The best way
to abuse your opponent is not to miss.
Let me show you.” 0

As he explained the different
techniques of a world—famous, pocket
billiards and trick shot artist, Jack White
let his cockiness slide and said very
softly, so no one would really hear him,
“But seriously, the kids here are
dynamite. I really love them.”

Heart

Continued from page 1

“As your cholesterol level goes down,
your risk of having a heart attack
diminishes, but it doesn’t stop at 200.
Every one percent drop in your cholesterol
level leads to a two percent reduction of
risk,” he said, citing an experiment that
found that people whose cholesterol levels
are 150 and under do not have heart
attacks.

Barnard said that cholesterol is found
only in animal products and never in
plants. It is a waxy substance that forms
plaques on the coronary and carotid
arteries, causing heart attacks and strokes.

He notes that these plaques can also
cause impotence.

“By age 60, one out of every four
American men is impotent,” he said. “Just
as a lifetime of eating fatty foods causes
plaques to block the blood supply to the
heart, so that the heart doesn’t work so
well anymore, and just as those plaques
block the blood supply to the brain, so
that the brain doesn’t work so well any
more, this happens in all parts of the
anatomy, and the result is impotence.”

To support the beneﬁts of a vegetarian
diet on heart disease, Barnard cited an
experiment in which patients treated with
the American Heart Association's
recommended diet developed larger
plaques, while the plaques of patients on
a vegetarian diet shrunk.

Barnard said that cancer is the number
two cause of death in the U.S., and breast
cancer is the number one cause of death
in American women.

“In the rural parts ofAsia, where the diet
is quite different from ours, where rice is
the main thing they eat and vegetables are
second and animal products are a small
part of the diet, cancer is quite rare,”

Barnard said. “It’s not genetic, because if
a Japanese woman moves to this country
and raises her daughters here, they have
the same risk of breast cancer as the
women around them."

Barnard said that in addition to a high-
fat and low-ﬁber diet, alcohol, birth control
pills and refined sugar have been noted as
possible risk increasers. 0

According to Barnard, scientists knew
about the relation of diet to cancer 10,
years ago but the public never received

the information. He believes that Breast

Cancer Awareness Month, a program that

promotes early detection but not

prevention, is partly to blame.

“They don’t talk about prevention, and -

I always wondered why not, until I learned
that it is a program launched by Imperial
Chemical Industries, which manufactures
a breast cancer chemotherapy," he said.
“They have refused to put in any
information about preventing this disease.”

The PCRM developed their own breast

cancer information service, which

encourages prevention. The number is 1-
800-US-LIVES.

Women worried about osteoporosis
should also know that dairy products will
not help them, said Barnard. .

“There isn’t anything in milk that anyone
needs,” he said.

He cited studies that prove milk has
absolutely no effect on bone density.

“High protein diets cause calcium to
leak out of the bones,” he said. “If you
want to have strong bones, lower the
protein content of your diet.”

Barnard said that there are no safe dairy
products. In addition to being sources of
cholesterol and fat, milk products have
been implicated in cataracts and ovarian
cancer

' While it may not resemble the games on
,. Mount Olympus, Pitt's Greeks kept the

Olympic spirit during the Greek Week

. Olympiad on Sunday.

The fraternities and sororities who
participated were divided into six different
teams, called match groups.

Match group four dominated the
competition, winning four of the eight
events. The group was comprised of
members representing Delta Delta Delta,
Phi Kappa Theta, Kappa -Alpha Theta,
Sigm_a_Chi and Phi Delta Theta.

“We didn’t have any plans for the events.
We were just going to let things happen
and have a good time. We got lucky and
got'placed in a good match group. We’re
pleasantly surprised with our success,"
Chris Forney of Phi Delta Theta said.

The events began with a tricycle relay
race ‘in Forbes Quadrangle, which resulted

participants tipping over and falling from
their vehicles.

“I didn’t think it would be that tiring.
My tricycle gave out. Next year we should
use 10—speeds,” Anders Fritzen said.

The tricycle relay race was followed by
a bubble gum-blowing competition.

Match group one memberjeremy Weiss
of Pi Lambda Phi described his technique
for the contest: “First you smoosh the gum
and breathe on it for mist. Then you chew
and chew, and then blow. I’m going to
make sure I have a nice consistency and
hold my breath for five minutes before I
begin,” Weiss said. I

Match group six representative Amy
Miller of Sigma Sigma Sigma said, “There
was too much pressure. I’ve been practicing
since before spring break. Two minutes
was not enough time for the sugar to
dissolve in the gum. I was disappointedl
couldn't blow my biggest bubble.”

The gum contest was followed by
belching and screaming contests.

Greeks

Continued from page 1
Participants in Greek Week are
attempting to raise over $100,000
for UCP to purchase equipment
that will help UCP clients live

I fuller lives.

“One way in which the Pitt
Greeks are helping the clients [of

I  UCP] reach their full potential is

by creating the Pitt Greek
equipment fund. The money from

if _ this fund will supply the clients

with something as simple as a
page turner to something as
complex as a computerized touch

. talker,” Greek Week overall co-

Chair Reid Sadler said.
In addition to money, Pitt's

Greeks have also donated their

time through four volunteer
events.

“The fraternities and sororities
who participated in the honorary
brother and sister program not
only helped the clients in their
struggle to be integrated into
society, but formed meaningful
friendships. Both parties have
retained lasting memories from
the time spent together,” Greek
Week overall co—Chair Kim
Fricchione said. ,

UCP Board of Directors
member Irene Nelson thanked
the Greeks for embracing people
with disabilities. “You’ve done
more than raise money and write
checks. You've given from your
hearts,” she said.

Demetrius Pappan, president
of Pappan Iiamily Restaurants,
has been a corporate sponsor of

Greek Week for nine years.
Pappan said it was the energy
and excitement of the Greeks
that made him and his father
want to be a part of Greek Week.
City Council member Bob
O’Connor, who became involved
with Greek Week nine years ago,
when he was an employee of
Pappan, said, “Each year it's
gotten better and more organized.
[Greeks] bring in fresh ideas and
expand on their predecessors.”
“Greek Week highlights all that
is good and positive of the Greek
system. This is the most

Chancellor of Student Affairs Bill

Over 400 of Pitt’s Greeks braved
the 30—degree weather to light a
ceremonial torch at the informal
opening ceremonies, which were

open to the entire Greek comm-.

unity, last Thursday evening.
The ceremony started by

lighting a small torch at the United

Cerebral Palsy home on Centre

clients formed a human chain
_and walked the torch from the
home to the William Pitt Union
lawn. The crowd cheered as the
ceremonial torch was lit.

‘ “I’m very proud of the entire

THE PI'I'I' NEWS, Monday, March 23, 1992

 

By Heather Gahres
Staﬂ" Writer

Despite the muddy course and cold
weather, over 1,000 people, including
Santa Claus, participated in Greek
Week’s five-kilometer walk/run
Saturday afternoon.

This year spirit chairs added a twist to
the run. Each fraternity and sorority was
asked to have at least one participant
run or walk in costume.

“We wanted to do something different
to make it fun. The guy who dresses up
as a waiter in the Boston marathon
inspired us,” Erika Weigel, spirit co-

‘ chair, said.

Eric Kiefer of Phi Delta Theta walked
the race dressed up as Santa Claus. “We
wanted’ somebody in costume, and
[Santa Claus] is the only one I own.
Walking the race as Santa was neat.
Cars were beeping, and a lot of little

. kids were freaking. People were going
nuts,” Kiefer said.

Members of Sigma Chi placed first
and last in this year’s race, repeating last
year’s placement.

Sigma Chi member Steve Sponseller,
who was the ﬁrsl Greek to cross the
finish line, said, “I’m happy that I could

Santa Claus participates
in Greek Week 5k race

since we won last year.”

Last-place ﬁnisher Louis Arbetter of
Sigma Chi said, “I had to pace myself. I
had to make sure I didn't get too far
ahead at anytime. I really couldn’t get
caught up in the race.”

The winners of the race said the
coursewas muddy and slippery. Some
people even fell at the beginning of the
course.

Fourth-place winner Ian Deardo of Pi
Kappa Alpha said, “It’s a good race. The
course was a little messy, but I think it
was faster than last year.”

After finishing the race in fifth place,
Rob Marshall of Phi Gamma Delta said,
“It was a tough race, but it was for a
good cause. Now it’s Miller time.”

The first sorority member to finish the
race was Crystal Corle of Chi Omega. “It
was tiring and muddy, but I loved
running it,” Corle said.

Student Government Board member
Derrick St. Clair, who is also a member
of Delta Tau Delta, ran the race with his
pet dog. _ ,

“I ‘think it’s great that over 1,000
participants came out to help United
Cerebral Palsy and to bring the whole
Greek system together to prove that
with our combined efforts we’ll
accomplish anything,” St. Clair said.

keep the tradition of Sigma Chi alive,

Olympiad
Continued from page 6

Events co-Chair Jeff Rosenthal said the
belching event did not portray a negative
image of Greeks since 10 years ago there
was a chug—a—lug contest. Members ran a
race, and they had to chug a beer at each
checkpoint. “We wanted an event that
would be like these events but wouldn’t
be too bad. Fun and games will be fun for
everybody,” Rosenthal said.

Match group four won the event with a
burp by Erin Walker of Sigma Chi. “I have
been practicing,” Walker said. “I knew
there were 20 extra points for creativity, so
I decided to belch, ‘Let's go Greek Week.’
Through all this craziness, we’re helping a
lot of people. That’s the main thing.”

Match group five won the screaming
event. Kimberly Buse of Kappa Delta
screamed for 4.06 seconds at a volume of
4.5 decibels.

The events then moved to the small
pool area of Trees Hall.

The swimming competition began with
an alligator raft relay race. Many of the
participant’s rafts ﬂipped over during the
race. Match group one member Coleen
Cerkan of Sigma Delta Tau said, “The
hardest part of the race was getting on the
alligator. I just used my legs and kept my
eyes closed.”

The teams then had to have one male
and one female participant from each
match group tread water and blow a
pingpong ball across the water without
using their hands.

For the Final relay event, seven plastic
rings were thrown into the pool with each

match group’s number written on them. “

One swimmer from each group had to get
the rings and place them on the pole from
biggest to smallest.

Matt Brady won this event for match”
group four. “Whenl first started, I tried to
find all of the rings marked number four.

1 Then I looked to see where the next one
I needed was, and then I’d swim to it,” he
said.

Brady is a member of Pitt’s swim team
and competed in
Championships.

The highlight of the evening was the
synchronized-swimming competition.
Each match group had a representative
from each house participate in the event.
The teams found out which song they
would be performing at the competition.
They were then given 10 minutes to
choreograph a routine. The song they
were given was Beethoven’s fifth
symphony.

Match group one became human
fountains, spitting water out of their mouths

.in order. ,

Match group ﬁve incorporated a group
cheer into its performance, and match
group six member Kristen Licht was thrown
into a double back ﬂip.

“It was a blast. I was afraid I'd hit my
head, but I trust these guys,” Licht said.

The winner of the event will not be
announced until later in the week.

As is customary with the Kuntu
Repertory Theatre, an audience
discussion followed.

The audience was impressed
with Effinger’s work and
complemented her for the
dedication it took to write and
produce the play.

After the conclusion, tours were
offered for the Stephen Foster
Memorial and the UP Gallery,
which featured holography and
mixed media works by R. Scott
Lloyd.

It astonished me that dou

I be found guilty of rape.

First, look at the facts of his
dysfunctional social history.
Newsweek magazine reported at
the time that Tyson “has been
sued by several women who ac-
cused him of fondling them.” Also,
consider that he was involved in
a rocky marriage to actress Robin
Givens —— a marriage well publi-
cized for its violence and torment
of Givens.

So if you cannot believe that
these examples of abuse can re-‘
ally leave people guessing, be-
lieve it. They did.

But new facts arise in this case.

three counts: one countof rape
and two counts of criminal devi-
ate conduct.
He could face up to 60 years in
prison, but he won’t. As a matter
of fact, in the Indiana legal sys-
tem, seven to 11 years is probably
all of the sentence that Mike Tyson
will serve.

Rape is a serious crime, no
matter who commits it. Yet on

Monday, Feb.. 10, the verdict came
down as guilty, and Mike Tyson
paid his $30,000 bond an_d walked
away a free man. I was under the
impression that rape was a major
felony and that felons were hand-
cuffed and removed from the
courtroom surrounded by police
officers.

Instead, Mike Tyson walked
out of the court with his manager,
Don King, and police officers
protecting him from the press and
his fans. I may be mistaken, but a
criminal should not be protected
from the public. Rather the public
should be protected from the
criminal.

It seems that perhaps Mike

Tyson is getting the celebrity
treatment rather than the criminal
treatment. ,He is a criminal, and

‘yet he is free to do as he pleases

until his sentencing.

As a matter of fact, according to
The Pittsburgh Post—Gazette, until
his sentencing, it is possible for
Tyson to have a scheduled bout
with Evander Holyfield to regain
his heavyweight title.

The Pittsburgh Press predicted
a complete Mike Tyson resur-
gence after his sentence is served.

My question remains: Is this the
proper message to be sending
people — young and old? Rape is
a crime; however it's not treated

as one that deserves a full punish-
ment.

Mike Tyson is a role model for
lots of people, and I think that we
are sending these people mixed
messages.

I-le committed a crime that is
punishable by law and perhaps
he’ll serve some time, but after h\
does serve less than 12 percent of
the full possible sentence, he has
the opportunity to make a full
comeback and even regain his
title without an unforgettable scar.

So, once again, society is saying
that it is alright to commit a major
felony because there will be an-
other chance for criminals, re-
gardless of what they have done.
I think not.

I think Mike Tyson's celebrity
status is gaining the upper hand
in this matter. In fact, it is justice
that should have the upper hand.

Media’s coverage choice questioned

So you want to make it on the
evening news?

There does not seem to be any
hard and fast rule for what it takes
for your story to be shown on the
news.

The world is so full of events
and happenings that a half hour
cannot come close to covering
everything. News organizations
must make choices about what
they will show each night on their
broadcasts.

This decision—making process,
which is necessary for all news
programs, involves value judg-
ments. By airing one story and
not airing another, there is an
indication about which issue or
topic is more important. So when
we watch the evening news, we
are seeing the stories important to
the directors and writers at each
station. _ ‘

In our society, this process has
many implications for our lives.
We rely on televised news to
keeplus updated on the world
around us. '

By watching the stories impor-
tant to the decision-makers l at
each station, we are" developing
their view of the world. News

power in this system._ -

Even though there is selection
in the news business, there are
some general rules for what should
definitely make the news. Most
every night,’-we can see stories

about the latest murders, robber-'

Election year hatred onrise

‘organizations hold a great deal of _

ies and accidents not only in our
area but around the world. When
the stories are particularly grue-
some and bizarre, such as with
Jeffrey Dahmer, the news will
devote continued coverage. We
all have an inclination to know
more about these cases and about
the individuals.

I was entranced when I heard
the voice of Jeffrey Dahmer
wishing he could somehow bring
his victims back to their families.
He sounded just like anyone else.

Beyond these areas of common
interest come the choices of the
various organizations. We are
lucky that there are not enough
murders, robberies and the like to
fill a 30-minute program. So what
are the rest of the stories about?
Many are about children, animals
and the environment.

There is a. very strong practice
among all news organizations to
highlight abuse and hardships
suffered by children. A few years
ago there was great devotion to
the story of Jessica McClure, who
was stuck at the bottom of a well
in Texas. In Allegheny County
last year there were continual

stories about Steven Selfridge, who -

was mauled by a group of dogs. ’

The news gives lead status to
kidnappings and babies found in
garbage cans. Stories of physical
and sexual abuse from around
the nation are part of the news —
even on CNN.

Children are a precious, im-
portant part of our society. When
bad things happen to them, there
is immediate sympathy. The
people at the news hope that
these sympathetic feelings will
keep these pathetic things from
happening to other unlucky
children. _ '

Recently, stories about animals
have had important places on
news broadcasts. We hear about
it when heinous acts are per-
formed on other creatures. Last
month there was a story about
mistreated dogs brought to the
Pittsburgh area from a kennel
down South. There were pictures
of the malnourished dogs, in-
cluding one of a little puppy who
was drinking milk in someone’s
arms. When we see a cute animal
mistreated, we feel angry.

Another story about dogs came
from New England where a
greyhound kennel burned to the
ground. Unfortunately, the racing
dogs were all locked in their
cages. The fire chief called the
kennel a “ﬁretrap.” There were
stories from the ﬁreﬁghters about
being able to hear the cries of the
dogs but not being able to help
them. By showing these stories,
newspeople show their deep

Racist speech has been bolstered by the
present recession. As the so-called middle
classes face the economic stagnation that has
plagued the U.S. since the ’70s, politicians are
feeding off racist hate, looking for political
opportunities. .

In the latest war of the words, U.S. Sen. Ernest
Hillings of South Carolina will surely fuel
greater hostility between politicians in Japan
and the United States.‘

On Monday, March 4, while touring a factory,
he suggested employees “Draw a mushroom
cloud, and put underneath it: ‘Made ih America
by lazy and illiterate Americans and tested in
Japan. This artistic suggestion was supposedly
in reference to remarks made by Japanese
Parliament speaker Yoshio Sakurauchi, who

claimed American workers are lazy, illiterate

and lack a good work ethic.

Hollings’ warped comments about the elimi-
nation of thousands of lives illustrate an all too
common solution to problems in our world —
kill, maim and destroy.

As well as Hollings comments, syndicated
columnist and Republican presidential candi-
date Patrick Buchanan embarrassed conserva-
tives with his inane comments a few months
back.

Buchanan suggested that the United States
import the remains of the Berlin Wall and erect
it as a barrier to keep out “Zulus and other
undesirables.” Once again the outsiders, the
dark-skinned, are blamed for the plight of the
poor, white, middle class.

It would be nice instead to erect a wall
around Patrick Buchanan and Sen. Hollings to
contain their racist hate. American industry is in
trouble; however the Japanese and other “out-

side undesirables” are -not at fault. As a nation,
economic growth— particularly in the area of
electronics — is stymied. After World War II,
the United States was the only nation left in
tact with a strong industrial base.

In today’s world, competition comes from
all sides: Asia, Europe, Central and South
America.

The United States will no longer be the

single industrial force on the planet. Economic A

restructuring right now is testimony to the
fact. '

“Our“ competitive edge is only worsened
by government policies over the last 10 to 20
years. During this time, education has slumped.
Human services have been sacrificed in order
to maintain a monstrous military establishment.
Even presidential candidates are trying to
ease voters by promising to reyive these dead-
end jobs.

Our nation does not need to manufacture
high-tech warfare; the industrial base should
emphasize the goods that people around the
world demand. We must think in terms of a
global economy. Hollingsfcomments reflect
frustration on the part of many disadvantaged
workers in the country. But anger should be
directed at policy makers and at corporate
America.

Developing a strong infrastructure in the
United States is not a difficult task, yet it has
eluded the administration, Congress and
planners in power for the last 20 years. Now
is the time to begin construction on a new
America. ,

Clowns like 'Hollings and Buchanan have
nothing to contribute to recovery. Instead
their hate will only mask the real problems
facing this country.

feelings about the inhumane A 3

treatment of animals.

In the past few years there has
also been more of an emphasis
on the environment in the news.
This is a product of increased
awareness of our deteriorating
surroundings.

During the war in thelPersiar_1

Gulf, news organizations tem- Q
pered the military successes by’

discussing the environmental ef-
fects of the oil-well ﬁres set by the
Iraqis in Kuwait.

They had scientists making so-
bering predictions about envi-
ronmental catastrophes. Fortu-
nately, the fires were extinguished
much sooner than anyone ex-
pected, and the damage was
minimized.

Last month, there was a story
from Albertville, France, about
environmental concerns over the
Olympics. _ »

Some of the residents despise
the overdevelopment of the Alps
in order to accommodate the
Games. By giving airtime to this
story, the news offers worth to the
argument. V

Having concerns and priorities
is a natural part of human life.
Newspeople are ‘ no different‘.
However people who give us the
news must remember, they have
the means to express their pri-
orities as well. _

Pitt lacrosse remains in first with 12-6 Win over PLC

By Jeremy Swarbrick
Staﬂ‘ Writer

_ Playing the uncustomary role of the
underdog, the Pitt lacrosse team overcame
a three-goal deficit to defeat league rival,
the Pittsburgh Lacrosse Club, 12-6, last
Thursday night at Pitt Stadium.

The victory for Pitt (5-1, 5-0 league) was
its first ever over PLC and puts Pitt in firm
control of first place in the Allegheny
Lacrosse League with only four games
remaining.

If the Panthers can hold on to first, it will
be the third time they have done so in the
past three years.

Over the break, Pitt defeated league
opponents Washington and Jefferson 17-
3 and last week and scored a 7-6 victory
against the neighboring Tartans from
Carnegie Mellon but dropped a game to

non-league opponent Gardne r-Webb (NC)
in Baltimore, Md., 14-3.

As usual, Pitt opened up the game
slowly, but unlike its past games, this time
the opposition was able to make Pitt pay
for it.

PLC opened the scoring early, getting its
first goal just 1:20 into the first period.
Throughout the opening quarter, Pitt
peppered the P LC net with good shots but
was not able to cash in on any of the 12
first—quarter opportunities."

In the second quarter, things appeared
to get worse for the Panthers as PLC was
able to beat goaltender Scott Knowles for
two goals in only the first 2:11 of the new
period.

This opened up a 3-0 lead early in the
second with the first goal bouncing off of
a Pitt defender in front of the net and the
second coming off of a turnover in front.

With the game possibly slipping away
early, the Panthers turned up their high-
powered offense, which has been
averaging over 13 goals in their previous
league games, and clamped down on the
defensive end of the field. Their effort
paid off as Josh Gochnauer pierced the
PLC net for the Panthers’ first goal of the
game, coming at 4:29 of the second and
just three minutes later, Eric Kaveny scored
another goal to cut the PLC lead to one at
3-2.

Any momentum the Panthers had seized
was given back to PLC as Pitt repeatedly
took careless penalties and gave the ball
away numerous times on the power play.

With the period winding down and Pitt
still trailing by a goal, Ed Croot fed
Gochnauer in front of the net for his
second goal of the game, knotting the
game at three apiece.

The tie only lasted 11 seconds as the
Croot-Gochnauer combination answered
the call again, this time with Croot getting
the goal to give Pitt its first lead of the
game, 4-3. Croot’s~goal capped a string of
four unanswered goals for Pitt, which
closed out the first half with the lead, a
lead that would never be seriously
threatened again. -

Pitt came out at the start of the second
half much the way it left it only 15 minutes
before, on a roll.

Dave Kounas ripped a hard bounce-
shot from about 15 feet out that beat the
PLC goaltender to the top half of the net,
giving the Panthers a 5-3 lead

With a two-goal margin, Pitt began to
dominate the game, especially on the
defensive side of the field. Defensemen

but that didn’t exclude him from
pre-event jitters. After all, he was

“I got caught up in where I was

was concentrating on not being

temperatures near 80 degrees,
Kolesar defeated Butala for
the regional title and the spot

A at nationals.

“The whole thing was really
stressful,” she said. “I cried
after I won; it was mentally
exhausting. I was nervous
about the whole weekend”.

‘The reward, however, was
sweet. Kolesar will compete
for the national title in Denver
as one of 16 regional champs,
a far cry above where she was
three and a half years ago,
when she discovered pool.-

“I had no clue what anything
was,” she recalled. '“I was
petriﬁed to walk in the room,
so a friend dragged me in
there. I just kept watching
better players.”

' Kolesar said she credits
much of her development and
success to Pitt’s billiards club
and its founder, Don Broggi.

“The club really helped me,”
she said, “and Don helped me
prepare”

A business and stats major
who commutes from East
McKeesport, Kolesar is on the
“five—year program.” But
besides pool and classes, she
also works at the Biomedical
Sciences building 21 hours
per week.

“I used to skip class to
practice, but now I try to put
school first and balance it
out,” she said.

Kolesar said she sees
shooting pool as a social sport
— one in which players can
compete and have fun at the
same time. But because she is
a woman, there are times
when the fun disappears.

“You want to play better
people, so I try to play guys
because they are usually
better,” Kolesar said. “But guys
get mad when I beat them.
Once they find out I shoot
well, they get real serious,
and itshould be a-social sport.”

Pool is a male-dominated
sport, but women are making
inroads, according to Kolesar.
Still, at the regional
tournament, men
outnumbered women by a
ratio of over 2 to 1. Kolesar
said there are never as many

. women as men, but women
are slowly balancing the
scales.

for it. I wasn't concentrating on
what I was doing until the race
was half over. Your concentration
can leave you pretty quickly, and
it is hard to get it back.”

Boyd and Kozlina were not
alone in their attempts at Olympic
glory.

Their head coach, Chuck
Knoles, was there for support
and advice. But Knoles is probably
not the best person to have around
if you need to be calmed down.
Boyd can testify to that.

“Chuck was there, but he would
be walking around doing
coaching things and I was doing
my own thing, and we would
bump into each other,” Boyd

said. “Right before I swam, he
would try not to be around
because he didn’t want to make
me nervous.”

“I have a reputation of being a
nervous coach —— so much so
that there is a running joke with
the team: ‘OK, the meet’s about
to start. If you want to talk to
Chuck, you'll have to go up in the
stands because he can’t stand on
the deck,”’ Knoles said.

“When Don [Boyd] swam, I got
so nervous that I had to "kneel
down and hold onto a platform
because my head started spinning.
It is probably similar to watching
your wife go through childbirth.
It’s a scary and exciting experience

to watch my swimmers step up to
the blocks in a big meet like that,”
he said.

Boyd swam a lifetime best in
the 200—meter breaststroke at the
trials, and when that time was
converted back to yards it
qualifyed him for the NCAA
Championship meet. Besides that
little bonus, the experience at the
Olympic trials taught both the
athletes and the coach some
valuable lessons.

“I’ve learned not to put so
much pressure on them,” Knoles
said. “I’ve also learned never to
say you can’t do something. Don
was telling me over and over
again that he was going to [qualify

for the] finals in the 200
breaststroke. He convinced
himself that was what he was

going to do, and he went out '

there and did it.

‘‘''Every time I go to a big meet-
like this, I begin to understand I
more about how important the A
aspect ofT

psy.chological
swimming is.” ,

“While watching the top guys,
I saw that they didn’t let their
nervesbother them,” Kozlina said.
“They were very collected behind

the blocks. Any meetl go to now,
I will notbe psyched out because"

I know if I can make it to this

meet, I can hold my own 

anywhere else.”

 Whoever started calling the
. Pittsburgh Pirates the Bucs has
 a sick sense of humor. It is a lack
Tof bucks that is slowly tearing
V apart a team thatshould dominate
- the National League East for a
few more years.

I The two-time defending
] division champs lost some role
 players after the 1991 season.
They filled in the gaps and won
- the title by 14 games last season,
"only to suffer an even more
‘damaging loss: Bobby Bonilla.
Worse yet, he went to the rival
Mets, leaving the Pirates’ chances
at repeating very much in doubt.

Still, the legacy of long—de parted

. General Manager Syd Thrift might

have kept the Bucs on top. When

 he started the team’s return to

‘respectability in the mid-’80s, he
built the team on pitching and
defense.

The Pirates were still as good in
those areas as any team in the
National League. More

 importantly, Thrift brought in

IICS t0 W

x.

Manager Jim Leyland, the best
manager in the league.

New GM Ted Simmons was off
to a good start. His first deal,
unloading unwanted pitcher Neal
Heaton for Kirk Gibson, was a
gem.

Gibson is beat up, but he can
still hit for power (16 homers last
season, two less than Bonilla)
and he can still run (18 stolen
bases last season). He provides a
solid bat off the bench and
insurance in case Orlando Merced
is needed back at first base or
Andy Van Slyke’s back worsens.

Then Simmons made a major
mistake. The trade of John Smiley
to the Minnesota Twins for two
prospects, only one of which
might help this year. Waiving Bill
Landrum from an already
questionable bullpen doesn't
help.

Simmons said that potential
free agents Barry Bonds and Doug
Drabek will not be traded, but he
also said finances were not a
concern in the Smiley deal, so
why believe him now?

some problems that aren’t money-
related. Andy Van Slyke’s recent
back problems gave the team a
scare, but it is Jeff King’s back
that is the key to the team. If he
is healthy, the lineup issolid.
They will miss Bonilla, but they
still have enough offense with
Van Slyke (.265, 17 HR, 83 RBI),
Bonds (.292, 25, 116, 43 stolen
bases), Steve Buechele and
improving, young playersJay Bell
and Merced.

The pitching may still be the
best in the division. Drabek may
never get back to his Cy Young-
winning level of 1990, but he will
do better than the 15-14 of last
season. Zane Smith has been one
of the top left—handers in the
league for the last two years.
Randy Tomlin must come up big
to take Smiley’s role, and Bob
Walk must stay healthy. Rookie
Paul Miller or Denny Neagle, a
pitcher acquired in the Smiley
deal, will take over the No. 5
spot.

Stan Belinda will get another
chance as closer, as will Rosario
Rodriguez. Brian Fisher could step

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Monday, March 23, 1992

in somewhere if he is healthy.

A key to the pitching is a top-
notch defense, with Gold Glove-
winners Van Slyke and Barry
Bonds and two guys who
deserved it, third baseman Steve
Buechele and second baseman
Jose Lind. The Don Slaught/Mike
Lavalliere platoon continues to
provide stability behind the plate.
Merced should be a defensive
improvement over Bonilla in right
field.

The New York Mets have
problems everywhere
defensively. Off-season
acquisitions have made them
better and the Smiley deal may
have weakened the Pirates
enough for the Mets to take the
division, but they did not address
their defensive problems.
Accusations of rape against Doc
Gooden, Vince Coleman and
Daryl Boston hanging over the
team won't help either.

Bonilla was a defensive
weakness in Pittsburgh, but he is
the best here with Howard
Johnson in center (are they nuts?)
and Coleman in left. This team

in another NI. East crown despite losses

has power pitchers, which means
lots of ﬂy balls, and with this
group, lots of adventures.

The infield isn’tso bad, butyou
have to wonder how much old-
timers Eddie Murray and Willie
Randolph have left. How__long
will this offensive-minded team
carry the questionable bats of
Chris Donnels (.225 in NY last
season) and Kevin Elster (.241, 6,
36)?

Even better question: Can
catcher Mackey Sasser throw the
ball back to the pitcher? If he
can't, that returns the duties to
less-than—threatening Charlie
O’Brien (. 185) and Todd Hundley
(.133 in the majors).

This team will score. Coleman
leading off and the big bats of
Bonilla (.302, 18, 100), Johnson
(.259, 38, 117,_30SB) and Murray
(.260, 19, 96) following is a
nightmare for opposing pitchers,
but the bottom of the lineup is
questionable.

The pitching is questionable,
even with the addition of Bret
Saberhagen. Doc Gooden is no
longer dominant, ‘even if he is
healthy.

David Cone supposedly
established himself as a
dominating pitcher last season,
but he was only 14-14 with a 5.29
ERA. Sid Fernandez finally lost
some weight but injured his knee
again. They" still have no fifth
starter. The bullpen is a mess

despite closer John Franco.

The Mets just have too many
problems to move to the top of
the division. I

The team most likely to step up
if the Pirates falter is the St. Louis
Cardinals. .

The bullpen, mostly Lee Smith's
dominance, carried the Cardinals
to second place last season. Todd
Worrell returns to make a strong
relief corps even better. Too bad
the starters are such a problem. If

_ Joe Magrane returns, the staff

might be decent, but that is very
much in question.

The offense is counting on a
beat-up Pedro Guererro and a
washed-up Andres Gallaraga to
carry the power load. Don’t bet
on it. That is even if Guerrero can
handle left ﬁeld, which he couldn’t
a few years ago with the Dodgers.

Bet on youngsters Todd Zeile, '

Felix Jose and Tom Pagnozzi to
carry the offense. The Cards aren’t
good enough to overtake the top
teams, but they could take the
division if more talented teams
falter.

The Chicago Cubs might move
up or they may fall lower. Yet
again, they are counting on a
beat-up -pitching staff to come
through. Healthy, the starting
rotation of Mike Harkey, Mike
Morgan, Greg Maddux, Danny
Jackson and Shawn Boskie or
Frank Castillo is good enough to
take them to the top of the
division, butJackson and Harkey
can’t stay in one piece. The
bullpen lacks depth and a closer.
Free—agent pick-up Dave Smith
(0-6, 6.00 ERA) was a bust last
season.

The Cubs will probably have to
bash out wins with their bats, and
they can do it. If anybody is going
to get $7 million, it should be
Ryne Sandberg (.291, 26 HR, 100

RBI and a Gold Glove). Andre
Dawson (.272, 31, 104) and
George Bell (..285, 25, 86) are
dependable power producers,
and count on Mark Grace to
come back strong after a
disappointing year. Third base
and center ﬁeld are still problems.
Eternal prospect Shawon Dunston
is still inconsistent.

The Philadelphia Phillies are
a team getting it together. They
already have a solid beginning
with john Kruk (.294, 21, 92) and
the ever-irritating Lenny Dykstra
(.294 and 24 stolen bases in 65
games). '

Wes Chamberlain is a
developing star in the outfield.
Dave Hollins was impressive in a
second—half debut at third.
Veterans Mariano Duncan and
Wally Backman will battle
youngsters Mickey Morandini and

Kim Batiste for playing time in
the middle inﬁeld.

Losing Rickey Jordan for six
weeks with a broken jaw will
hurt (and probably already does,
if you ask Jordan).

The young pitching is getting
there. Ivan Dejesus, Terry
Mullholland and Tommy Greene
have shown they can pitch. Now
they have to do it consistently.
The rest of the rotation and the
bullpen are questionable. Closer
Mitch Williams can be
dominating, but he does not
inspire conﬁdence.

A lot of young players will
have to develop very quickly for
the Phillies to contend before ’95.

It is going to take a lot longer
than that for the Montreal
Expos

Dennis Martinez deserves a
better fate. He is the only
dependable starter, and there is

no dependable relief pitcher. The
outﬁeld of Ivan Calderon, Marquis
Grissom and Larry Walker is
impressive, but where is the
infield?

Tim Wallach went south in a
big way last year. Delino
DeSheilds also struggled. They
must come back strong, and a
first baseman must be found for
L’equipe de Montreal to return to
even a respectable level.

It all comes down to a four-
team race. The Mets and Cubs
proved they could fall apart last
season, and the Pirates seem to
be on the brink of a similar fate,
especially if they trade Bonds.
The Cardinals seem solid but not

spectacular.
Look for the Pirates to win their
third—straight division

championship on the strength of
the fewest question marks and
Ley1and’s guidance.

Eric Mobley sparked Pitt back

Florida does not have the
personnel to match up down
low. It has one of the SEC’s
smallest front lines. First-year
center Andrew DeClerq is very
quick on the offensive blocks
and is developing into a solid
force, but behind him there is
no size. The 6-10 DeClerq
