coming to
Pittsburgh

Sierra Starks

Pittsburgh might soon start look-
ing more like Gotham City than
it already does.

Batman will be making an ap-
pearance in Pittsburgh this sum-
mer, as “The Dark Knight Rises,”
the third installment in the most
recent Batman series, is set to
film in the Steel City.

Upon the reaching of an agree-
ment between Warner Bros. and.
the Pittsburgh Film Office, four
to six weeks of shooting is now
expected to take place Downtown
and in nearby locations.

“We.are thrilled to be welcom-
ing the Batman ﬁlm to Pittsburgh
and eager for the economic im-
pact that our city will experi-
ence,” Mayor Luke Ravenstahl
said in a statement released by

the Pittsburgh Film Ofﬁce yester-
‘day. “This is another example of

the growing ﬁlm industry in our
community, and we will be rolling
out the red carpet for them.”
The ﬁlm, which will mark the
conclusion of director Christo-

A pher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, will"

once again star Oscar-winner
Christian Bale as the Dark Knight
himself.

Nolan will also produce the
ﬁlm with his longtime producing

Lawyers, politicians
talk Marcellus Shale

Andrew Shull
For The Pitt News

The statewide issue of natural gas
drilling touched down once again on
Pitt’s campus, with experts on both
sides adding to the debate.
Attorneys, students, engineers
and scientists gathered in the Uni-
versity Club ballroom yesterday to
discuss legal and environmental is-
sues associated with Marcellus Shale
gas drilling. The industry could affect
hundreds of thousands of people’s
employment statewide, as well as the
environments in which they live.’

Yesterday’s symposium comes
at a turning point for the industry.
Gov. Tom Corbett’s current budget
proposal calls for no extraction tax
on Marcellus Shale, alegislative deci-
sionwhichwould make Pennsylvania
the only gas-producing state without
such atax. The proposal represents a
shift from former Gov. Ed Rendell’s
policy ofbanning drillinginstatefor-
ests and pursuing an extraction tax.

The debate’s importance was evi-
denced by the opening address of Lt.
Gov. Jim Cawley — the head of the
Marcellus Shale Commission, abody
put together by Corbett to address
drilling issues.

Cawley and Corbett have said that
they want to pursue environmentally
sound, but not overly restrictive, reg-
ulation of the drilling industry. Other
states have pursued a different angle
in approaching the Marcellus Shale
issue. New York placed a year—long
moratorium on drilling in 2010.

The keynote speaker for the after-
noonwas Kathryn Klaber, president
and executive director of the Mar-
cellus Shale Coalition, a group that
represents the business interests of
the various industries involved in all
stages of natural gas production. .

“ ust because you are pro—envi—
ronment doesn’t mean you need to
be anti-business,” she said.

Klaber argued during her speech
that drilling is safe, and that the pri-
mary concern of many environmen-
tal groups is mitigatedby the amount
of space between the shale deposits
and the aquifers.

Klaber said that there have been
no conﬁrmed cases of groundwater
contamination from natural gas
drilling. .

But Pitt law professor Emily
Collins said that groundwater con-
tamination is only one of the many
environmental issues that could arise
from Marcellus Shale drilling. ‘

During her speech, Collins.

stressed that many of the steps in-
volved in fracking can have negative
environmental impacts. ’

She pointed to improper disposal
of the ﬁackingﬂuid, in_eﬁ'ective treat-
ment of that ﬂuid, spills and improper
well construction, air quality issues
from the combined effect of all the
wells, solid waste sent to landﬁlls
that aren’t designed to handle such
substances, naturally occurring ra-
dioactive materials that can come
up during the fracking process and
water withdrawals as all potential
hazards. .

Klaber said that there are a num-
ber of environmentalists working
within the indusuy, and she encour-
aged students who are interested in
environmental issues to look into
ﬁnding new ways to make the process
safer from within the industry.

Natural gas drilling, known as

“fracking,” begins by drilling un—'

derneath groundwater aquifers and
then horizontally into the shale for-
mations. Then tiny cracks are blast-
ed into the rock layer, after which
pressurized water with additives is

Students make Pitt’s case

campaigns at Pittwill continue and that students
should stillvisit their representatives.

During Pitt Day, many students had a difficult
time meeting with their representatives because
the House and Senatewereinsessionthroughout
the day. .

Sophomorejames Dougheny met with State
Sen. Elisabeth Baker’s legislative director, who
assured Dougherty that Baker, R-Dallas, was not
in support of such drastic cuts. 2

“Itwas reallyanencouragementto hearthat,”
Dougherty said.

Some students had more luck meeting with
legislators. Sophomore Reid Goldberg met with
State Sen. _]ohnPippy, R-MoonTownship, and State
Rep. Randy Vulakovich, R—Glenshaw. Goldberg
saidthatPippywas againstthe drastic cuts, while
Vulakovich said they were merited.

Goldberg also met two staffers along with a
group of students. And although the students
weren’t given anypromises ontheﬁitureoutcorne

ofthebudget, Goldbergsaidthe triptoHarrisburg
wasworthit. '

“It’s stacking the deck against Corbett, and
this shows it’s notjustaDemocratandRepublican
issue, but an issue about students,” he said.

Stieber said that the Pitt Day in Harrisburg

' had “passion.” .

State Reps. Dan Frankel, D-Pittsburgh; Matt
Smith, D-Pittsburgh and Kortz and State Sen.
Jay Costa, D-Pitisburgh, condenmed the drastic
cuts to higher education in the main rotunda in

ﬁunt of a staircase packed with Pitt students and
admin’ 1strat1' ‘on.

“Support our education, the future of our na-
tion,” the students chanted.

Frankel saidthatwhen Corbett announced the
budget proposal, he emphasizedﬂiatbalancingthe
$4billion deﬁcit would be a “sharing sacriﬁce.”

But Frankel said the cuts have been “placed
squarely on the backs of students.’ ’

He addedthattherewillbe no Marcellus Shale
extractiontaxunderCorbett’s budget—apointof
contenﬁon for many students and legislators.

Kortz emphasized that students need to be
proactive, and Smith said students should ﬁght
foraﬁﬂl restoration of funding. ‘

“There is no excuse to ask students and fami-
lies to bear the full brunt of the burden,” Frankel
said. a c I

Sophomore Leah Farinola said she has three

thatsheis alreadyhavingadiﬂiculttimepaying

that Pitt will have to experience cuts because of

The water contains sand particles, which
keep the cracks from closing, allowing the natu-

‘Dark Knight’
bright light for
Pittsburgh  

itt doesn’t offer a Certiﬁ-
Pcate in Damsel Studies, nor

should it — polishing a state
of distress doesn’t exactly prepare
college students for the villainy of
the modern job market. Instead,
bright young college—aged people
are charged with ﬁghting society’s
evils and being heroes.

However, often there come
times when youthful audacity de-
ﬂates under situations aimed to
depress - not unlike the effect
of Pitt’s NCAA defeat not too long
ago. But as of yesterday, at least we
young Pittsburghers can put our
self-doubt away. After recovering
from upsetting losses on the court,
we will ﬁnally get a chance to live
in the company of heroes.

Yes, that’s right. Batman is
coming to Pittsburgh. Yesterday,
ﬁlm director Christopher Nolan
announced that the third install-
ment of his blockbuster Batman
franchise will take place in the Steel
City. While the exact ﬁlming loca-
tions are still in ﬂesh-out mode,
cameras are set to start rolling this
summer, with the cinematic prod-
uct expected to hit theaters in]uly
2012, according to the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette.

As gas drillers suck the safety
from our waters and as the gov-
ernor sucks the funding from
our schools, we think an inﬂux
of pectorally gifted, big—name ac-
tors could only do wonders for this
city — not to mention the extra
economic boost a hungry cast
and crew and ﬁlming permits will
bring. If Downtown’s buildings
look as “beautiful” on screen as

 Look   .........

Nolan describes them, perhaps the
’Burgh will gain wider recognition
— at least among moviegoers —
as more than just a dusty former
steel town mainly ﬁlled with either
21—year—olds or 65-year—olds.

Despite its small size, Pitts-
burgh has long been a favorite of
Hollywood big shots; not only did
Pittsburgh bear zombie classics
like “Night of the Living Dead”
and “Dawn of the Dead” from its
bridge-bespeckled loins, but you
can ﬁnd ’Burgh scenes in ﬁlm fa-
vorites like “Silence of the Lambs,”
“Flashdance,” the original “Angels
in the Out:ﬁeld” and even “Robo-
Cop.” While this has been nice and
all, as the sixth-highest grossing
franchise of all time, the Batman
series could offer a level of acclaim
never before experienced by the
likes of Yinzers.

So with that said, we’d like to
prescribe a few valuable tips for
Pitt students to keep in mind as
they start to shape up for their
big—screen debut (and because
Christian Bale’s massive pecs won’t
be won over without some hard
work):

1 - Take a shower. Yes, at least as
of press time, it’s possible to bathe
in Pennsylvania water without re-
ceiving a bromine overdose.

2 - Clean your teeth. Let’s make
the Batman crew glad they didn’t
choose to shoot in West Virginia.

3 — Work on your personality.
The good people at the Princeton
Review rated the Pitt student body
as the eighth happiest in the na-
tion in 2010 —-— don’t prove them
wrong. Fm

Thursday at 8:30 p.m.

Hosted by the Pittsburgh Contem-
porary Writers Series

Event free to the public

The best story Ernest Hemingway
ever wrote, in his estimation, was one
sentence long: “For sale: baby shoes,
neverwom.” Ifbrevitywas the writer’s
rallying cry, it’s a safe bet he would be
a Lydia Davis admirer.

Davis — who will give a free lec-
ture at the Frick Fine Arts Audito-
rium this Thursday — is famous for
controlled vignettes that run as short
as a paragraph or even a line. Unlike
Hemingway, however, Davis’s ﬁction is
arrestingly self-conscious, and lauded
as such by authors likejonathan Fran-

zen. Also unlike Hemingway, Davis is '

an established translator, with a rep-
ertoire encompassing everyone from
Flaubert to Proust.

The writer recently spoke to The

Pitt News about artiﬁciality, followers
and the problem with the word “ex-
perimental.”

The Pitt News: Many of your sto-
ries seem to transpire almost entirely
within a character’s mind. What do
you think are the advantages of this
approach, as opposed to the more
extroverted narratives readers are
familiar with?

Lydia Davis: I don’t know about ad-
vantages, but it’s closer to what actually
happens in my own life — it feels less
artiﬁcial to me than creating scenes of
the more traditional kind. I am always
interested in the mind and how the
mindworks, howfeelingswork-—that
sort ofthing——andIcanlookat it more
directly, cleanly, clearly by working that
way [rather] than in the more tradi-
tional way, when the material’s more
removed and more obstructed. I guess
that’s the advantage for me.

TPN: In an interview with liter-
ary magazine The Believer you said
character interaction, aswell, seemed
artiﬁcial because it’s hard to recollect
entire conversations. Is artiﬁciality
something you’re constantly trying
to bypass when you’re writing? How

did you develop that sense of artiﬁ-
LD: Oh, it’s hardto say.Istartedout

by writing more traditional stories  A

Maybe it was one long story that took
forever to get rightthat made me impa-
tient, ﬁnally, inseuingup scenes. That
story took abouttwo yearsto get right.
Obviously not two years of working
every day, but coming back to it again
and again. I felt much happier when I
stopped writing that way and wrote
shorter, short, short stories. Even those
were not necessarily based on my life
or coming from my head, but they felt

more immediate, and they didbypass _
alot ofthat artiﬁciality. Theywere sort '

of fable—like stories. So I think that’s
when I broke free of the more tradi-
tionalforms, butl do keep comingback
to them now and then, in one way or
another.

TPN: You’ve often expressed dis-
satisfaction with terms like “experi-
mental writer.” Do you think writers
should be evaluated as part of a group,
or is it more appropriate to evaluate
them on a purely individual basis?

MUSIC COLUMN

Musical shares Kuti’s life with public

Patrick Wagner
Music Columnist

Broadway musicals have tackled the intrigue of
love, the urban jungle and dancing Nazis with
equal fervor in the past, but last year a number
of high—proﬁle producers, includingJay—Z and
?uest1ove, put togethera show called FELA! that
ﬁnally reinnoduced a revolutionary from the
perspective of the stage.

FelaAnil<ulapo Kutiwasn’t likely to raise many
frat roofs before his death in 1997, but his music
could dance the soles off a shoe in the 23rd cen-
tury. Born in 1938,»Kuti grgadually accumulated

a vast array of inﬂuences after forming his ﬁrst i

band in early 1960s Nigeria. Around 1969, he

 .- .started9al!ingtheﬁ1si9I!_9ffiuﬂcjazz andvarious 3
‘ indigenousstylestl1atheplayedwithﬁs‘band';75?'

by then named Africa ’7o — “afrobeat.”

Perhaps one ofthe best introductions to what
this complex combo sounds and looks like is an

early video made by Cream drummer Ginger
Baker, who traveled throughout Africa in 1971
to learn about various rhythms and improve
his technique.

Baker’s video shows Kuti wearing a broad

I smile, dancing like a maniac around a night-

club ﬂoorwhile singing, seemingly directingthe

movements of tlie music and his fellow dancers

with asubtle ease. Movement isaword which de-

scribes the video well, and especiallywith sucha
plethora of polyrhythm — morethanone “beat”

going on at a time — there’s a sense of urgency

that commands it.

That urgency carried over into, or perhaps
from, Kuti’s ideology, whichwas complexly Pan-
African and socialist. The very language he sang-
in — pidgin English, made up of proper Brit-
ish English and Nigerian dialects — reﬂected a

choice on his part to communicate in the com-*  A
-Orchestra took up the afrobeat mantel in 1998

mon language of Nigeria’s various groups.
His lyrics often commented on various con-

tentious issues and, although Nigeria’s press was
state-rum  the 1970s, the musician would 1

also share  opinion in print. He’d buy ad space

to e)q)loitaloophole inthe system and write col- _

umns about any issue on his mind. The columns
eventually stopped because of controversy, and
even some members ofhis band leftbecause the
political pressure was getting to be too much.
With an afrobeat orchestra of guitars, keys,

 percussion and horns, Kuti’s songs were backed
f with the best supporting musicians he could ﬁnd
throughout his career. His kit drummer, Tony A

Allen, still has the impressive skill he honed in

One of Kuti’s classics that’s deﬁnitely worth
picking up by itselfis his 1975 record E>¢>em2'w

the title track, the epic builds as jazzy piano" and
guitar chords interplay and theswarmof rhythm
gradually envelops the song. Whenwe ﬁnally hear
Kuti chanting with his band, it’s almost a sen-
sationally warm remembrance of the incident.
“Water No Get Enemy,” the other song, is jazzier
still andfeels likeataste ofMiles Davistakenwith

' He continued to make records both with Af-

THROWING A KIRSCHBALL

Best teams rarely take trophyin C

Connecticut, Butler and VCU just the latest examples of the parity in the NCAA"l5Tournamerift

Lauren Kirschman
Staﬁ Writer

Every year, certain events in
March Madness are almost in-
evitable. There will be upsets and
buzzer beaters, overtime games
and controversial calls. It’s what
makes the NCAA Tournament
exciting and, in my opinion, the
greatest spectacle in sports.

It’s everything a sports fan
could want. It’s one-and-done.
You lose, you go home.

The playoff—style determina-
tion of a champion is exactly what
many people — myself included
— are practically begging for in
college football. 2

But did the best team in col-
jglege basketball win this, year

when the Connecticut Huskies

K

celebrated their championship
Monday night? No. The hottest
team in college basketball won
the title.

That’s what it often comes’

down to in the NCAA Tourna-
ment. Talent matters, sure, but

it seems that luck, match-ups and '

hot streaks at the right times mat-
ter more.

There are few years when I can
say I believe the title game came
down to thebest two teams in
the country. North Carolina and
Illinois in 2005 comes to mind.
In a battle between the two No.
1 seeds, the .four—loss‘Tar Heels
defeated the one—loss Illini in a
classic championship battle.

But overall, I still believe Il-
linois was the better team that
season. And while National
Champion Maryland was prob-

ably the country’s ‘best team in
2002, it didn’t face off against
the nation’s second best squad
in ﬁfth-seeded Indiana.

' I still wholeheartedly believe
that Pitt was the best team in the

is all that matters. And maybe it
is. But there’s something to be
said for a strong regular season,
and there’s definitely something

to be said for regular season con-

ference titles.

Maybe Kansas’, Ohio State’s
and Pitt’s seasons this year will
be forgotten, but I think that’s
a shame. All those upsets are a
big reason why March Madness
is such a phenomenal event, but
they are also good reasons to re-
member that the trophy doesn’t
necessarily end up in the hands
of the nation’s best team.

Connecticut lost its last two

games of the regular season, go- ,

ing down 65-56 to West Virginia

and 70-67 to Notre..Dame. Then

the Huskies rolled into Madison
Square Garden and guard Kemba

Walker decided that they were ’

done losing. That was that.

teams in Georgetown, Pitt, Syracuse and
Louisville. Connecticut used that momen-
tum to power its way through the NCAA
Tournament, ﬁnishing the season by cut-
ting down the nets on Monday night.

Some people say conference tourna-
ments drain a team’s energy. Walker and
the Huskies disagree.

But during the regular season, the Hus-
kies ﬁnished ninth in the Big East. Ninth.
They received no bye in the Big East tourna-
ment. Looking at the entire season and not
just the NCAA Tournament, Connecticut
wasn’t even the best team in its confer-
ence this year.

The Huskies weren’t even close.

Then there’s Butler, a name that pains
Pitt fans in a way only Villanova can du-
plicate. The Bulldogs were _a No. 8 seed
from the Horizon League. They finished
the season with 10 losses.

Connecticut’s Kemba Walker led his team to a Big East tournament championship and
~ an NCAA national title to end the season.

But they got hot at the right time. So did
VCU, which ended up in the Final Four, but
which no reasonable person would argue
was legitimately one of the best four teams
in the country this season after the Rams
snuck into the NCAA Tournament with a
No. 11 seed.

Butler managed 41 points in the Cham-
pionship game while shooting 18 percent.
While Connecticut’s defense deserves a lot
of the credit, the Huskies shot 34 percent
themselves — including 29 percent in the

' first half.

The first half of the game was nearly
unbearable to watch. Many experts called
this year’s National Championship the ug-
liest ever.

But in the end, the Huskies will be re-
membered as the 2011' National Champions
— even if Connecticut wasn’t the nation’s
best team. I
