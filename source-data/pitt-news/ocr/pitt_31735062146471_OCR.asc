It was reported in the columns of

the Panther some time ago that the.
early fundsv of‘ Campus Week had" as-
sisted in the purchase of a‘ new fur
coat for John Stewart, alias Johnnie.
Proof of innocence alleged to have
been furnished by Johnnie has been
sustained by a certain restaurant
manager in Oakland, it is said, and
every effort is being made to retract
the statement and to clear Johnnie in.
the eyes of the student ‘body. This is
a diﬂicult. job -for they all know him
and realize his great weakness. The
latest reports however, should free
the boy from suspicion in that regard
for he is now inthe trammels or the
‘law. The coat in question was not

purchased at all.‘ _Mr. Stewart has
witnesses to prove that he acquired
this coat at the Collegeillnn where it
hung innocently on a rack with a
number of others. A r

* if this is the case, and we are in-

CHANCELLOR SURVIVES

 

. Pitt College, May 26,’ (Very special
advance wire): Pitt’s great foam.
week for 1924 passed out into history
most ﬁttingly and properly Friday
night at Motor Square Garden; and
what a passing out! The headline
says, “breathless success”, but that's
only to fool the prohibition oﬁicers;
everybody had a breath. '

_ The migratory dance was 2,. moving
spectacle. Sixteen couples migrated
clear to the West Penn Hospital, and
two hundred and twenty-seven ,more
stood still and let the fraternitiesyml
grate around them in a beautiful per-
ambulating circle.

The push ball row was disappoint-
ing. Not more than twenty were de-
lightfully injured and only four mor-
tally, these last losing theirheads.
Happily, many of the spectators threw
their arms out of joint tossing bottles
at the reieree.

crowned on,Thursday, but it is hoped
