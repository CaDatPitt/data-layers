First Brief

The play concerns Morgenhall’s
ﬁrst Dock Brief. Fowle, the de-
fendant is without relatives and
funds. Therefore, he is entitled to
choose any barrister to defend
him. Morgenhall has been chosen.

The action proceeds to depict

the efforts of Morgenhall, who

Book of Criticism

-Dr. EdwinfM. Moseley will

Modern Novel, at the Book
Center on April 2, at 4:15 p.m.
The book has ‘been recently

promises to be a milestone in con-
temporary literary criticism.

Dr. Moseley, who is ‘clean of the
faculty and professor of English
at Skidmore College, has analyzed
the Christ ﬁgure and story as they
appear in many modern novels.

The study begins with three
fairly orthodox variations on the
savior-archetype: the Tragic He-

Ribonuclease Molecule
Partially Synthesized

By lVIATTI-IEW SWETONIC

Dr. Klaus Hofmann, chairman of the biochemistry de-
partment, has announced that a team of researchers under
his direction has performed the ﬁrst partial synthesis of an
enzyme ever carried out in a chemical laboratory.

At a special press conference held last Monday morning
in Scaife Hall, Dr. Hofmann stated that the successful
synthesis has provided a “real breakthrough in enzymeo-

logy.”

Importance of Enzymes
The important of enzymes to the body, explained Hof-
mann lies in the fact that “every reaction which occurs in
a living cell is enzymatically controlled.” A

The synthesis
ﬁrst 13 amino acids in a chain
of 124 that make up the ribo-
nuclease molecule. This mole-
cule is directly involved in the.
breakdown of ribonucleic acid
in the body. This acid is the
chemical substance involved in
cell reproduction.

In a letter to the March 20
issue of The Journal of the
‘American Chemical Society, Hof-
mann reported that the partially
,synthetic enzyme has 70 per cent
of the activity of the natural pro-
duct. ‘

Interesting Phenomenon

“It is especially interesting,”
mused Hofmann, “that you can
leave out such a large part of a
peptide chain and still retain 70
per cent activity. _

, “However,” he continued,
“why it is only 70 per cent ac-
tive and not 100 per cent I
don’t as yet know.”

Hofmann, however, was quick
to deny that his experiments have
produced life in a test tube. “I
believe,” he stated, “that an en-
zyme is still a dead molecule and
that there is still something miss-
ing. Maybe in ten or so years
some one will be able to say that
he has synthesizedlife in totality
— but not now.”

The experiments took Hofmann
and his staff over a year to per-

“Viewed from the standpoint of
an institution of higher learning,
any form of discrimination under-
mines the supremacy of reason in
relation to sentiments.”

Landlord Behavior

The statement comments on the
behaviour of some landlords in
the area that discriminate in rent-
ing the living quarters. “The Uni-
versity . . . should examine its
own attitude to charges of the
discrimination made by any stu-
dent, faculty member or ad-
ministrative personnel.”
The Association statement ques-
tions the University policy on in-
ter-racial dating. “Are there overt
hints and suggestions by admini-
stration officials that they frown
upon such relationship? If so,
does such action emanate from
parental pressures?'0r does it re-

form. “Much of our work,” he ex-
plained, “was tuned to discover-
ing important information regard-
ing the ribonucleus molecule’s so-
called ‘active site’ — that portion

which holds the key to an en-

zyme’s function.”

Hofmann believes that the
discovery of an active site in a
speciﬁc molecule could answer
many basic biological questions.

“This discovery,” he added,

“has no immediate commercial or

pharmaceutical advantage. All we
have done is to learn something
fundamental but very important
about enzymes.

Catalysts
“Enzymes are the catalysts in

all life functions,” Hofmann con- '

eluded, “therefore, we have taken
a long step toward understanding
the chemical basis of life.”

Assisting Hofmann in the syn-
thetic formulation were Dr. Wil-
helm Haas of Germany, Dr.
Michael J. Smithers from England,
Dr. Yecheskel Wolman of Israel,
Dr. Noboru Yanaihara of Japan,
and Frances Finn, _‘a graduate stu-
dent. y ‘

Dr. Hofmann has been at the
University since 1944. He -was
named chairman of I the depart-
ment of biochemistry’ in 1952 and
a year later began the studies
that led to the synthesis of the
natural hormone ‘ACTH three
years ago.

EX-Ambassador Lands
I British Colonial Policy

By MARCIA

BERNSTEIN

Sir Hugh Foot summed up many of. the rewards of
diplomatic life in one simple statement at his Midday talk
Friday afternoon when he quietly stated “I shall thank God
for the rest of my life that I can see how much good is done
when men come together for reconciliation.” ‘

At the outset of his lecture, Sir Hugh noted that Britain

was coming along in the goal that‘

it has set for itself. All but ﬁve
per cent of the one—time British
colonies are now independent.
The ex-British ambassador to the
United Nations added that all of
' “decided
to stay in the British Common-
wealth except four; Burma, Ire-

- land, Union of South Africa, and

the ‘United States.”““ .
Nigeria Example ‘

Taking Nigeria‘ as an example,

of the work Britain is trying to
do, Sir Hugh explained that his
government is “trying to bring
all, the people together, working
with them in order to form a free
Federation ‘of, Nigeria.

“Where there has been the

greatest possible difference, we

have shown how‘ much good
can be done when men are’
brought together,” headded in
reference to Nigeria. where 200
different tribal Wlanguages _are
spoken. ‘ ’

Drawing‘ a‘ parallel between‘

conferences and working with
colonies that are prospective new
nations,‘,Sir Hugh gave his audi-
ence some advice given him by a
Greek oﬁicial: “Beforeiyou go into
conference, stop and ask
yourself what you want to do,
when you leave, stop. again and
ask yourself ifyou have achieved
it.” .
‘ Past-Governor

'As a past governor of many of
the ex-colonies, Sir Hugh pointed
out that when a colonial nation

.‘‘leaves on the day of indepen-
‘ dence (of the colony), it should

leave a disciplined ‘army, drawn
from the people, and a disciplined
police. ‘

“When you've seen a com-
plete lack of authority, it is
something you never forget,”
he explained. “Good order is
necessary for good govern-
ment.” _

Speaking of the differences to
be found in Africa, Sir Hugh des-
cribed the continent “as a house.
In all of the separate rooms work
goes forward. In the cellar, a
fuse is lit which will blow; the
whole house sky high:”

Common Qualities
He went on to say that “all

"these, new nations have certain

qualities in ‘common. As well as
we think we understand them,

they understand us better.’ These‘

people have had to watch. You
know your superior better than
your inferior. And they say ‘what
you do speaks. so loud, I cannot
hear what you say.’

“They are not going to‘ be
fooled by the United States,
Russia, or Britain. They ‘pro-
pose to think ‘for themselves,
speak for themselves, and form
their own conclusions.”

Sir Hugh does not object to this
at all. He thinks “that people
should rule themselves. I believe
in national independence. These
views were popular in this coun-
try in 1775. Of course, you car-

ried things a bit too far. You had
agitators and resorted to violent
action.” ,
Hope of World

The African nations are offered
as the hope of the world by Sir
Hugh because they “are determin-
ed believers in the UN. The big
countries like it when it suits
them. The small nations are deter-
mined to maintain it.”

“There is a" new idea in the
world,” he stressed. “When a
new dispute takes place, it is
not just the. two disputants in-
volved. The Secretary-General
and his team bring a new test
to the dispute —- a test of in-
ternational advance.

‘The world with a balance~of

terror between the East and the

West is in a precarious position.
The initiative or the Secretary-
General and his team,” he con-
tinuéd, “searching for -a solution
based on international advance
backed by new nations may be
decisive.-”

‘I Students’ Participation

In World Events Noted

Editor, The Pitt News:
The article by Barry Gross,
“Demonstrations ‘R i n g e r s’ ”
(March 20), while entertaining

' and undoubtedly applicable as a

caricature to some “student
demonstrators” overseas, is mis-
leading. It also shows a lack of
-understanding of the very im-

portant role played by students

in“ many areas of the underde-

’ veloped world.

The university students of
Latin America are justly proud
«of this important role in their
countries’ affairs. In their un-
countries, which

of social and economic equality
and liberal democracy found in
the United States, their action
indicates the fundamental dis-
:satisfaction°-with th-e status quo
and a very worthy desire for
progress. I

Latin America is indeed
blessed in that its students are

not immersed in the political -

apathy‘ of the young American
intellectuals. The role played by
Latin American students is, in

V the majority of cases construc-

tive and in accordance with the
most liberal and progressive
values of their societies.

It took the energetic voice
of. Venezuelan and Peruvian
students to tell the American
people just, how hated a man
Mr. Nixon is among the intel-
lectuals. ‘

In Bolivia in 1952, students
were prominent in bringing to
‘power thewﬁrst progressive and
popular government the country
'has had.

In Columbia in 1957, students,

the opposition. ,

were inﬂuential in overthrowing
the dictator, Rojas Pinilla. In
Cuba, students effectively op-
posed the hated Batista, and
since then, some have become

disillusioned with the .Castro
regime and have actively joined

Whatever side they ‘might be
on, they are working for what
is or what they ‘believe to be the
welfare of their people and the
progress of their country.

In Paraguay today, students
constitute the only effective’op-
position inside the boundaries of
the country to an odious tyrant
who is ‘unfortunately supported
by the United States, yet whose
existence is ignored by the vast
majority of’ American college
students.

In Brazil, students expressed
the will of the Brazilian people

 for a strong republican democ— ’

racy to ﬁght for the interests of
the Brazilians. Countless other
examples could be‘ cited—some
from personal experience. But
perhaps Mr. Gross ,.would not
believe .me because I don't
wear a dark trenchcoat.

I would venture to add ‘the
opinion that the supposed older
look, of at least Latin American
college students vis-a-vis their
American counterparts, has lit-

tle to, do with chronological age. ,

Pedro J. Lintner
L.A. Senior
(Editor’s N o t e : Columnist-
editor Gross says that he does
understand the role in politics
played by real students and
commends to the attention of

Public Law 87-793    

Newspaper offices are deluged by, wallow in
and often thrive upon news releases, brochures and
organization bulletins posted_ from every conceiv-
able, and -often inconceivable publicity closet on
the face of this organization- "'
whacky world. G en e r ally,
printed ' tub—thumpings from '
off-beat organizations -present
no problem to the newspaper;
either they are newsworthy‘
enough to rate» a few inches in"
the columns, nutty enough to
rate an editorial, or nonsensical
enough to be plunked into” the.
circular’ ﬁle cabinet.

One political sheet recently
has created a bit of a disturbance in the thinly-
carpeted iofﬁce of the editor of this newspaper,
however. It is a publication which has not reached
my desk \yet. The. Federal Government won’t allow

 

its delivery without my written permission.
Monday, I‘received a’ disturbing card from the
Cent~raliPost Office in New York City. Its, main
portion, a brief paragraph, can best explain the
disturbance, as it is the actual irritant: A
Message to Addressee. ‘ -
“T-his office is holding unsealed mailed matter
addressed to you from ‘a foreign: country. Under
Public Law 87-793, the Secretary of the Treasury

has determined this mail, to be Communist propa-

ganda. It cannot .be delivered to you. unless you
have subscribed to it, or otherwise want it. Please
check the appropriate space? under “Instr.uctions”
on this card and return the card. If your reply is
not received by the date indicated, ‘it will be as-

sumed that you do not want to receive the pub1i.— .

cation(s) listed, or any similar publication. This
mail will then be destroyed.” A‘ / '
Under the “Instructions” section of the _card, I

’ . By Matthew Nesvisky

Students, but I‘m really not sure and have no way

of telling. The Post Office, you see, won’t let me’

have my mail.

iPublic Law 87-793 has presented a real dilem-
ma for me, I’m sorry to say. I am, frankly", afraid
to ask the Sleet-and-Snow Boys to send me the
mail. If my Government is so afraid of the effects

.of distributing such mail, what view, then, would

they take of people who demand ‘to read it? Will. A

they keep a list “for future reference” of college
editors who demanded pink propaganda? Will this

hurt my chances of applying for a government job _

some day? Honest, -I don’t wantpany trouble. _
B-ut questions will bubble to the top. First off,
how did’ the Government determine that this mail
was “Communist political propaganda?” Oh yeah,
they, said the mail was‘ “unsealed.”.And‘hey, how

‘ did that mail get unsealed?'And hey, I can under-

stand their, assumption that I don’t want the mail
if they don’t hear from me, but how can they as-
sume that I don’t want to receive any “similar

publication?” For how, may I ask, can they deter-p '

mine what is a similar publication and what isn’t?

For thatpmatter, how canal determine any damn‘

thing about the mail it‘ I don’t even have the
slightest idea what it is?
Too Risky? _ ‘_

These questions really disturb me. I don’t want
to risk the chance of being accused.subversive.
Call me chicken, but being painted pink is no

’ laughing matter in these rather high-strung days.
>'St'ill,‘I’feel an obligation to hear- all voices» out,

and how can I ever form a logical opinion on this

propaganda, "if propaganda it is, without ‘seeing
it? It just seems un-American to do otherwise,

-but at the sameitime, -the American Government
feels it can shoulder that responsibility. for me. .'
Lhaven"-t been able to ﬁgure out what todo
yet. This may be one -off the most important decis-
ions of my life; one which may affect my political

thinking for the rest of my life;~- one which may ‘

affect my Government’s view of me for the‘ rest of
my life. '

And so thecard remains on my desk,_as yet

Politics   I

’ Although students 1,; the United States general-
ly consider the Central and South American count-

tries as “underdeveloped,” the students of Latin’
America are far ahead of their northern neighbors‘

in at least one important re-
spect—political influence. Both,-
the type and extent of political?
inﬂuence exerted by-the Latin
student can be seen from a quick’ '
glance‘ at events. in our hémis I
phere. _ " -
"Very recently,‘ for example, ‘
Latin students have "played in-
strumen-tal roles in the over-
_throw of dictatorships in Cuba :
and Venezuela. In fact, accord-
ing to the February i961 issue
of Journal of Politics, “the intense and relatively
continuous political involvement of youths is char-
acteristic of most Latin American political systems,”

Venezuela is a pa-rti-.cu_la-rly interesting example,

of the political inﬂuence of students because all the
major political parties in that country today origin-
ated in University groups.
Betancourt ,S!l'irred _
President Romulo Betancourt" began his political
career and his party when he stirred up trouble
against the dictator'Juan Gomez. Fearing for his
political, and perhaps physical, life, Gomez wasted
no time in throwing Betancourt and_ over one
hundred other students into jail in 1928. Later,
under the dictatorship of Perez Jimenez, the stu-
dent agitation against the government became so
serious that in 1952 Jimenez closed Central Uni-
versity and kept it closed until the fall of 1953.
The agitation was the making of most all the

University students, but it was said that the law -

students generally started the trouble, and if
there seemed to be a chance of reprisals from the
Government, they always managed to let others
be punished. The engineering students, on the other~
hand, upheld their. t'raditiona‘l reputation for being
-the“most1-conservativ-e.,;‘ ‘ ‘ i ‘ '-

  

 

 

 
   

 ,By iTi‘hornas. Pilate

’ ‘After. ‘having played such a mags rule iu» the

eventual .toppli.n:g of Jimenez, students were the‘
deciding voice in the drop-ping of professors, said i

to have favored the dictatorship. In July» of 1958,
when it was rumored that .a military coup was"
eminent, a large but orderly demonstration of sup-
port by «students armed with weapons showed the
democratic" Venezuelan government on whom much
of its stability depended. '

Venezuela is typical of the political “situation of.
most Latin American countries. J.anio Goulart, for -

example, needs the support of labor and the far
left for the stability of his Brazilian Govern‘.-men-t,
and most of the far left a-re students. In Cuba,
the long-surpressed antipathy of the students for
the Batista regime quickly changed to exultant
empathy with Fidel Castro, \

Not All Innocuous _ A .

By comparison, the political activity of students
in the U.S. is no where near asinfluential. How-
ever, it would be incorrect btosay that all campus
political activity is inocuous. For example, a wide-
spread protest by University of California students
forced the administration into making ROTC non-
compulsory. Demonstrations bfy Berkeley and San

. Francisco students will keep the House Un—Ar_neri-

can Committee away from San Francisco for a
long time.

But perhaps the most interesting comment
typifying the Very small, but signiﬁcant, “revolt”
on the U.S. campus comes from E. J. Hobsbown in
the New Statesmgn, quoting a US. college student,
“So I made up my mind,” said the unidentiﬁed stu-
dent, “I said screw the future. If that’s the future,
I don’t want any part of it. So I’m notgoing to
worry about being ﬁred from a job andra career
and all that. I’m going out and do something.”
However, whether the support of the University
student will ever be as critical to the lU.iS. govern-
ment, as Latin student support is to his, remains
to be seen. But an analysis of why‘ the Latjf; student
does have such s zovt/7:91:12» fsvhoiuq

7 ' Complaints about the drain
on the local economy by tax
faexemptions granted the ex-
lpanding University were an-
_swered by Chancellor Edward
fH.5Litchﬁeld March 19 atthe
Engineering and Mines Alumni
Dinner, sponsored by the Engi-
jneering and Mines Alumni As-
sociation. .
it The Chancellor stated that
money brought into the Pitts-
burgh area from outside the dis-
trict deﬁnitely exceeds that lost
_in taxes not collected on the in-
. creasing amount of University-

owned property. All real estate
owned by educational institutions
is automatically non-taxable.

' There are two main sources of
.money coming into the district,
said‘ the Chancellor. The ﬁrst is
that which comes from the large
'number of out of town students
‘who pay tuition and frequently
room and board to the Univer-
,sity. This money is in turn used
. ‘for the salaries Df local residents,
 who work for the school, and for
supplies purchased in the area.

V The students themselves also
4-" spend money in the Pittsburgh
district. Faculty members,
.whose suport is to a great ex-
tent provided by tuition, are
another considerable source of
revenue for the community,
V which woulld not be present if
It were not for the University.

A second source of money
coming into the area are the nu-

 ,an;ts a.4na Tuition

merous government and private
grants which support the increas-
ing amount of research carried
on by the University faculty.
These make up a growing in-
vestment in such projects, which
is eventually distributed through
the community. '

Dr. Litchﬁeld feels that this
ﬂow of money into the area more
than offsets real estate tax losses.

He also explained- that the
School of Engineering and Mines
is the next area of top priority
in the University’s expansion
plans. 17 million dollars will
be the cost of the new Engineer-
ing and Mines building to be
constructed on the site of the
present Logan Armory and the
dental clinic.

The administration hopes to in-
crease the engineering faculty in
numbers and competence and to
expand the amount of research
carried on. A better integration
with the other areas of the Uni-
versity is also a part of its fu-
/ture program.

In connection with this integra-
tion is the National Aeronautics
and ‘Space Administration pro-
gram, already in progress at the
University. The -project, which
will attempt to coordinate a to-
tal effort of the school, including
particularly the areas of the na-
tural sciences and health pro-
fessions, aims at two goals.

The ﬁrst is to solve any prob-
lems of space that the Univer-
sity faculty and facilities can
encompass. The second I objec-

..,_’ ,_/,-.

tive is to ﬁnd means of addi-
tional build-up of the area’s
economy from educational and
research developments. The ad-
ministration feels that the
“spin—off” from such work will
stimulate local business and in-
dustry.

At the dinner, the announce-
ment was_ made of a full one
year [scholarship from the alumni
office for a high school senior
with superior academic ability
and an interest in engineering.

The award is in honor of Dr. G.

R. Fitterer, dean of the School
of Engineering and Mines, who
will become Distinguished Pro-
fessor of Metallurgy in the de-
partment.

Program m Spam
New York University will institute a program this fall

at the University of Madrid leading to a degree of master
of arts in Spanish through their school of Graduate Arts and

Sciences.

The program has developed ‘from an undergraduate
level started in 1958 between the two schools.

“There has been a growing 4

demand among American stu-.
dents for a graduate program
in Spanish that would fulﬁll re-
quirements for American de-
grees while at the same time
offering study under some of
'Spain’s most distinguished pro-
fessors,” stated Dr. J. Richard
Toven, chairman of the NYU

ispanish department and co-
ordinator of the graduate pro-
gram.

Students in the program take
two graduate courses at NYU’s
second six-week summer session
from ‘July 29 to September 6.
They then enroll for a 24 credit
minimum load at the University

of Madrid.

These courses, including 15
credits required in ‘courses open
only to graduate students, are
identical with courses offered at
NYU but are taught by full-
time professors of the Univer-

sity of Madrid’s Faculty of
Philosophy and Letters, accord-
ing to Dr. Tpven.

Attendance and periodic exami-
nations are obligatory, and ﬁnal
semester examinations are requir-
ed for degree credit. .

LOUD ROARING marked the entrance of St. Patrick this year. The
bearded boy in green, who always manages to make the scene in
some unusual conveyance, came by dragster this year. Originally,
plans called for him to burn down Bigelow on two wheels only,
but spectators crowding the street cramped his style, so he came
in on four points, in what was still impressive style.

OUT OF THE SNAKE COUNTRY, summoned to lead the Engineers
down the bill for their annual invasion of the lower campus, came
St. Patrick. This year, he supposedly turned his powers that once
rid Ireland of snakes to the problem at hand — parking meters.

ALL WAS NOT PLAY during the event-ﬁlled Engineer’s Week. On
Thursday, at 11 a.m., Jim Guion, co-chairman of Engineer’s Week and
president of the Pennsyvlnaia Society of Professional Engineers, is at the
rostrum for one of the seminars conducted. It was the end of a debate
at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall —- “Resolved: That the Federal
Government Should Subsidize Automation.”

 

AS IF SPONSORING St. Patrick were not enough, the Metallurgi-
cal Engineers also gave the campus these battered bunnies.

Outlook Dim for   Gymnasts

Gymnastics Coach Warren Neiger has named six men on the Panther team to parti-
cipate in the NCAA Gymnastics Championships Friday and Saturday at Fitzgerald Field
House. Neigernamed Ed Zamecnik,iJack Leh ner, Bob Pingatore, Ed Stim, Roland James,

and Tom Misage asithe entrants. 4

Neiger will enter Zamecnik in
the six all-around events. Zamec-
nik, ‘who has had a disappointing
season, showed good form in the
Eastern "championships and placed
fourth in the Olympic all-around.
He has the best chance of any
Panther to place, according to
Neiger. .

Zamecnik also will be the top
Panther in the high bar an‘d the
parallel bars. “Ed is looking very
:good -on the high bar in recent
workouts,” commented Neiger.
“He looked better than he has all
year.” ’ ‘C

Jack Lehner, the top long horse
man, is also given a_ good chance
to place by Neiger. Lehner was
the most productive Panther gym-
nast during the dual meet season,
scoring‘ four victories and two

seconds in long horse competi-
tion. Lehner also placed fourth
in the Eastern championships.

Lehner also will be entered in the
still rings.

The other entrants are not
given too rnuch chance to qualify
for the ﬁnals. Ed Stim, a good
performer in the high bar and
parallel bars, will have to turn in
a greatrperformance to qualify
_for_.the ﬁnals. Bob Pingatore, who
has been erratic all‘ year, will
enter the long horse and floor ex-
ercise. Off his dual meet perform-
ances, he does not appear to have
much chance of . qualifying.

A possible dark horse in the
side horse competition is Roland
James. James’ haslooked excel-
lent in several dual meets, and
sloppy in others. If he can put
two good performances together,
he could score some points.

Tom Misage will be the sixth
man for the Panthers, but he is
entering, just for the experience,
according to Neiger. Misage will
participate in the horizontal bar.

The full rundown of Panther

[entrants are long horse——Zamec-

nik, Lehner, Pingatore; side horse
—- James, Za.mecnik, Stim; paral-
lel bars — Zamecnik, Stim; high
bar —-— Zamecnik, Stim, Misage;
still rings —— Zamecnik, Lehner,
Pingatore; ﬂoor exercise——Zamec-
nik, Pingatore; Olympic all-
—around—Zamecnik.

The Panthers have not had an
NCAA champion since Torn Darl-
ing won the still rings title in
1959. Last year All-American Earl
McConnell scored the best
Panther performance in four
years by capturing third place in
the floor exercise.

This year’s outlook for_ scoring
NCAA points is not encouraging,
but a ray of optimism shines be-
cause the Panthers placed more
men in the Eastern ﬁnals than
every’ -team besides Penn State
and Syracuse. The potential for
a decent showing is there. It is
only a matter of using it.

Hot Weather Comes;
Gridders Begin Work

By ART FLEISCHNER

Sixty-six football players,
out‘ in '70 degree temperatures
tice. The first session was one
condition of the ‘ﬁeld.

While most of the -players

including 30 lettermen, were
Monday to start spring prac-
week late due to the rain and

took ‘advantage of the incle-

ment weather to study, several coaches were travelling to

different high schools, talking to.
players they are trying to have
enroll here. _

John Naponick, the most
sought—after player in the state,
however, was unavailable to
Panther football coaches the last
two weeks. Naponick, 6—foot-9
and 285-pounds, was playing cen-
ter for Norwin High. He led them
to the state ﬁnals where they lost
despite Naponick‘s 28 points.

Likes Hometown
‘ Naponick was also selected on
the All—Star football team as a
tackle. He is reportedto have had
over 100 offers from colleges all
over the country. Pitt has a good
chance of getting Naponick be-
cause he has expressed a desire to

play before his friends and
family.
Another top prospect is

Uniontown’s Ron Sepic. Sepic,
is both an All-State basketball
and football player. His high
school career is similar to that
of Brian Generalovich’s, but the
Panther grid coaches hope that
Sepic doesn't make the same
decision -as the General and '
stick to basketball.

Sepic has also had offers from-

schools all over the -country. The
Uniontown end seems to have
narrowed his decision to Pitt and
West Virginia. If he does decide
on WVU, he will be the sixteenth
player to do so.

Levine Twins
Swim at NCAA
This Weeliend

Rob and Ron Levine have been
working out of Trees Hall pool in
preparation for the NCAA Swim
Championships at Raleigh, N.C.
this weekend. They have been
using a unique pacing machine
that runs at different speeds and
allows them to practice in si-
mulated competition.

Rob will compete in the 200-
yard backstroke, 500-yard free-
style, and 1650-yard freestyle. Ron
will swim in the 100 yard free-
style, l0O-yard butterﬂy and 200-
yard butterﬂy.

The 1650 will be a new event
for Rob since it is not swum at
University meets. Ron will also
be swimming in the 100 yard
freestyle for the first time this
year.

The competition will be strong
this year as perennial power-
houses such as Indiana, Southern
California, Ohio State, and East-

ern champ Yale,’ will all com- ~

pete.

Field House Set For
Championship Meet

. By AL BLUMKIN
Final preparations are under way for the 21st annual
NCAA Gymnastics Championships which will be held at
Fitzgerald Field House Friday and Saturday. The teams are
beginning to arrive and the gymnasts are working out at

the Field House.

The equipment and apparatus has been changed for
the meet. New equipment has arrived and is being used
in the workouts. There are new sets of parallel bars and
still rings. The Nisson_Company‘ has also provided two new
horses, a new horizontal bar, and a trampoline. New mats
for the free exercise competition have also arrived.

The gymnasts and coaches will start at Webster Hall

Hotel during the days of the meet.

The hotel ,will also be used for 8

the annual meeting of the Nation-
al Association of Gymnastics

Coaches and the Rules Commit-
tees.
- Scoring System

The individual scoring will be .

based on the system of the Fed-
eration of International Gymnas-
tics. This system rates the per-
formances on the basis of ten as
high score rather than 100, which
is used in Eastern and Midwest-
ern competition. There will be
four judges who will rate the
gymnasts. The highest and lowest
scores will be dropped and the
two, middle scores will be aver-
aged for the individual score.
Team scoring will be based
on an 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 sys-
tem. In case of a tie for first in
any event. both teams will be
awarded ten points. If there is
a tie for tenth place in the pre-
liminaries, both men will be al-
lowed to perform in the ﬁnals.
Trophies and medals are award-
ed to the ﬁrst ﬁve ﬁnishers in
each event. There are also team
trophies which are awarded at
the end of the competition. Each
school is permitted to enter ﬁve
men in each event.

Neiger Predicts

‘ Coach Warren Neiger expects
this tournament to be “one of the
best ever.” “Everything is in
order, the competition will be
good, and tickets are selling rap-
idly for the ﬁnals.” ‘

Neiger established Michigan
and Southern Illinois as the co"-,
favorites in the team competi-
tion. ‘With Gil Larose and
Arno Lascari, Michigan will be
tough to beat, but Southern
Illinois has the depth to do it,”
he said.

 

Q‘?

Tom Seward

Mike Henderson
Seek Gymnastic Crown

Neiger also rates
Penn State, Southern California,
and California highly. California
was unbeaten for the second
straight year in Big Six competi-
tion, while Southern Cal only lost
one dual meet. Southern Cali-
fornia is the defending team
champion and should give a good
defense of its title. ‘

The applications for entries
closed last Friday with a record
total of 42 schools entered. There
will be close to 200 performers in
the preliminary round, and of

these, 80 will qualify for the =

ﬁnals.

Tickets are selling fast for the
Saturday night session, but there
are still many available. The sales
for the preliminary sessions on
Friday afternoon and evening are
going poorly, and there are plenty
of tickets available for these ses-
sions. Student tickets are 50 cents
for each preliminary round and
$1.00 for the ﬁnals on Saturday.

Xth in Nationals

By BOB SMIZIK

Observers at both the Eastern and NCAA wrestling

tournaments had a hard time

swallowing the tale that the

A‘ Panther’s 157 pounder Tim Gay had not wrestled in a
A varsity dual meet this year.

The speculation was propounded when Gay ﬁnished
third in the Easterns, and sixth in the Nationals last

Coach Peery

, Angry at Mat
;iReferee’s Call

Mike Johnson’s loss in the
' ﬁnals of the NCAA 123-pound

A ‘ championship last weekend

was as disturbing to Rex
Peery as it was to Johnson.

The coach was still com-
plaining about the officiating
Monday afternoon. Johnson look-
ed like a sure winner in the over-
time against Mike Nissen, after
they had battled to a 6-6 draw
-in regulation time, when he es-
caped from the Nebraska ace and
then took-him down. '

When in control of Nissen,
Johnson turned him on his back

, ‘for what looked like a predica-

ment and two points. The official
said no, and acocrding to Peery
it cost Johnson the match, even
though he was later pinned.

Had To Ride
“If Mike had gotten the predi-
cament he would have led 5-0 and
could have let Nissen escape,”
“Peery said. “But with only a 3-0
lead he had to ride and risk get-
ting reversed.” Johnson was re-
versed and pinned with only ﬁve
' seconds remaining in the first
“period.

Johnson, by the way, was the
youngest wrestler in the ﬁnals.
at 19 years. Nissen is 24 and
Phil Kinyon, who lost to Kirk

Pendleton in the 157-pound
ﬁnals, is 27.
Pendleton’s win over Kinyon

was the biggest match of the
tournament since no two grap-
plers came in with bigger reputa-
tions. Kinyon owns three Big
Eight championships and a Na-
tional title.

, Wanted Title
_Pendleton had been beaten
twice in the NCAA ﬁnals and a
glance in the locker room before

, the match showed how badly he
wanted the championship this
year.

He was so emotionally ﬁred-
up that he could barely control
himself and Lehigh Coach
Gerry Leeman had a. difficult
time keeping him calm. On the
mat it was a different story as
Pendleton decisively beat Kin-

'yon, 5-2, and ﬁrmly entrenched
himself as one of Lehigh‘s and
the East's all-time greats.
Pend1eton’s title gave the East-
, em Intercollegiate Wrestling As-
sociation four titles, with Jim
Harrison, Mike Natvig and Jim
Nance being the other winners.
This was more than any other

‘weekend.

Gay was simply in a bind here
because of line-up difficulties and
formidable opposition from his
own teammates. He had to beat
out Jim Harrison and John Carr
for a spot in the line-up.

pursuit as he was in trying to
drop his weight to 147 pounds
where his chances appeared much
better.

When Carr dropped down to
147 pounds for the tournaments,
Gay got his chance and made the
best of it. '

Gay made, perhaps, his finest
-showing in losing to Kirk Pen-
dleton at Nationals. According
to Lehigh publicity man Sam
Connors, “Gay gave Pendleton
the toughest match I ever saw
Kirk win." This was before
Pendleton beat Phil Kinyon for
the title, but still quite a com-
pliment.

Despite his ﬁne showing in
tournament action, Gay may have
just as tough a time in making the
dual-meet lineup next year.

Although Harrison graduates,
leaving a vacancy at l67—pounds,
there is the possibility that Lee
Hall,__ the 177 pounder this year,
will step in at Harrison’s old spot
and Ken Barr will move down to
177 pounds.

Peery, however, dismisses this
possibility. “It would be too hard
for Hall and Barr to keep their
weight down that low.’' he said.

If Gay can live up to his tour-

inament placings, however, Peery

would be happy enough to give
him another chance next year.

Baseball Coach Bob Lewis Looks
Forward to Better Catching Corps

Five Receivers Vie
For Starting Position

On Panther Ball Club

By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ

This year’s catching staff
should be stronger than last
year’s, according to Panther
baseball coach Bobby Lewis.
The main reason for this is
competition. Five men are out
for the job.

“Whenever you have ﬁve men
out for one position, each one
really has to work,” Lewis said.
"Last year we only had one
catcher, so -he could afford to
make mistakes. This year the boys
know that if they don’t come
through, someone else will be be-
bind the plate.”

The incumbent catcher, Mike
Supsura, will have to battle Tim
Grgurich, Bill Bodle, Doug Cham-
bers, and Stan Janicki for the
backstop job. As of now, Lewis is
uncertain of the starting berth.

“They can an catch. The guy
who starts will be the guy who
hits the best. It’s that simple,”
Lewis, said.

Wants .250 Hitter

“I’d like to get at least one hit
a game from our catchers. Just a
.250 or .260 hitter is all we need.”
Last year, Supsura played in ev-
ery game and batted .140 with
only three runs‘-batted—in.

Tim Grgurich, who lettered as
an receiver two years ago, is not
likely to give Lewis the punch
he wants. As in basketball, his
strength is defense, not offense.
When asked about his batting
average, the catcher replied, /‘‘I
don’t want to remember it. It
was real low.” ~

  
  
  

 

mks SUPSURA
Seeks To Retain Job

Grgurich may have glue in his
glove, but he also has it on his
throwing hand. He is a decided
liability with men on , base.
Against Penn State two years ago,
he had 11 bases stolen against him
in six innings.

Young Hopeful

The most promising newcomer
seems to be Doug Chambers, a
transfer student from Johnstown.
Chambers might have the hitting
ability Lewis seeks. He played
sandlot ball in Johnstown last
year, batting .306.

Pitcher John Carlisle and out-

ﬁelder Dick Wagner both played
in the same league before joining
 Lewis’ squad.

Another catching hopeful is
Bill Bodle, who plays halfback
on the football team. Bodle bat-
ted .250 in alsandlot league in
Chicago last summer.

 _. Stan Janicki is the ﬁfth can-

‘ didate for the position. He played
his high school ball at Lockport,
batted
around .400. Lewis thought Ja-
. nicki was jar freshman, but when
'_ he learned the young receiver was
5 a sophomore, he just smiled.

Lewis concluded that all ﬁve
catchers have defensive ability,
but the man behind the plate on
opening day will be the best bit-
ter.

Does a man really take unfair advantage of women

when he uses Mennen Skin Bracer?
All depends on why he uses it.

Most men simply think Menthol-iced Skin Bracer is the best
after-shave lotion around. Because it cools rather than 
Because it helps heal shaving nicks‘ and scrapes. Because it

helps prevent blemishes.

So who can blame them if Bracer’s crisp, long-lasting aroma

just happens to affect women soremarkably?

Injuries to Important Runners

Rees’ Main Worry for Opener

Injuries to three of his top
point—getters are track Coach
Carl Rees’ biggest worry as he
preps his team for its outdoor
season opener, April 6 against
Army at the Stadium.

" Co—captains Joe Friend and
Vance Carter and hurdler and
high—jumper Jack Whiteford are
all bothered by minor injuries
that may keep them out of the

Friend, the thin-clads leading
hurdler, in addition to being a ﬁne
sprinter and broad jumper, has a
pulled hamstring muscle, the
same ailment that afflicts White-
ford, Carter is down with a
sprained ankle.

Warm weather is the best
remedy for their injuries,” Rees
said. “When we had a chance

to get outside two weeks ago
it did the boys a lot of good and
the good weather we’re having
now should make them better
sooner, although I don’t know if
they’ll be ready for Army.”

The loss of these three against
Army, which is stronger than
usual this year, could be disaster-
ous for the Panthers. They repre-
sent the Panthers best in four ev-
ents, the hurdles, high jump,
broad jump and 440—yd. dash.

Author to Review Book
On Christ Pseudonym

(Continued from Page 1)
ishment, and Archetypal Son in
Lawrence’s Fathers and Sons.-

Later, in the book Christ ap-
pears as a youthful German
soldier in Erich Maria Remar-
que’s All Quiet on the Western
Front, as an unconventional
preacher in John Steinbeck’s
The Grapes of Wrath, as an im-
prisoned Bolshevik leader in
Arthur Koestler’s Darkness at
Noon, or as a convicted murd-

erer in Albert Camus’ The
Stranger.
As he presents the various

ﬁgures of Christ, Dr. Moseley ex-

. plains how many modern novelists

use symbolism, allegory, and
myth to present their religious
themes. However, he warns read-
ers against intellectualizing any
novel and says the reader must
experience a story emotionally be-
fore he will be able to criticize
it fruitfully. He writes, “Creative
writing demands creative read-
ing.”

“The Commonweal” issue of
March 22, 1963 calls the ‘book
a_ common reader's introduction
to comparative mythology, as
well as a study of the problems
of the artist in society. It says
that the book is written in a
readable style that is pleasantly
free from technical jargon.

The Pittsburgh Press calls Dr.

facets of the boo ,” she said.
“Also, I would like to see better
coordination of the staff as a
whole so that each staff member
would, have an overall view of
the book as well as his relation

to it."

Concerning the actual publi-
cation of the book Miss Korn-
feld explained that she would
like to see it remain as much or
even more student centered
than it is now.

Vrana, a junior English major
is also the Druids Sophomore Man
of the Year. Recently elected cor-
responding secretary of Druids,
an honorary for sophomore and
junior men, he is" also a member
of Phi Eta Sigma, freshman scho-
lastic honorary, and Pi Delta Ep-
silon, national journalism honor-
ary.

Past Experience

Current layout editor of the
1963 Owl, Vrana served as edi-
tor of the Polaris student hand-
book. He served as a host for
“Pitt Preview” this year.

“We are going to try our lfest
to make everyone in this school
care about the Owl,” the new
business manager said. “We will
promote the Owl the best way
we can through advertising and
sales.”

Members of the Owl executive
committee who selected the new
editor and business manager are
William Stanley of the Fine Arts
department; Mrs. Agnes Starrett,
director of the University Press;

A Joel Filner, current editor of the

Owl; William Schneider, current
business manager of the Owl; and
Irving N. Rothman, director of
publications.

All appointments of the execu-
tive committee are subject to the
approval of th e publications
board which will meet on Friday.

Moseley’s work “a product of ad-
vanced and highly literate ap-
proaches to the study of litera-
ture, and is likely to have a wide
effect on future criticism."

Born in S. Carolina

Dr. Moseley was born and rais-
ed in South Carolina. He received
his BA degree at the College of
Charleston and his MA and PhD
degrees at Syracuse University.
He has taught at Syracuse and
Evansville College and has been a
Professor of English at‘Washing-
ton and Jefferson. In 1961 he be-‘
came Dean of Faculty and Profes-
sor of English at Skidmore. ,

The recently published book
by Folley and Burnett, The Best
American Short Stories, lists Dr.
Moseley’s story “Off Duty"
among the “distinctive” short
stories in American magazines
in 1961. Also Dr. Moseley has
edited with Robert Ashley
Elizabethan Fiction published
by Holt, Rinehart, and Winston.

Dr. Moseley has published both
fiction and criticism and has lec-
tured extensively in the ‘areas of
his special interests, the Renais-
sance, the historyof the novel‘,
and contemporary literature. Re-
cent articles by him have discuss-

ed such diverse authors as Edith «

Wharton, Robert Penn Warren,
and the “beat” and “angry” writ-
ers. He is currently engaged in a
book length study‘ of the English
novelist Kingsley Amis.
