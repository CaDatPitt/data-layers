Doctor Is 0ut!

An irate junior entered the
Dean of Men’s Oﬁice last Wednes-
day to register a complaint about
student health facilities at the
University.

After the preliminary interview
with the secretary his case was
headed by one of the DOM assis-
tants.

It seems that he had gone to
the Health Service Office to get
medical approval to participate in

.-a sport. He found that the doctor

was out of town and there was no
assistant.

The DOM Olfice found out from
the Health Service that in the
case of seriously. ill students a
local hospital would be called. But
what about aspiring athletes?

Congress Overrules Parkinson
On Junior Worthies Selection 1

. “By linvx MARINO

Student Congress has overruled its president and
straightened out some tangled rules of membership for the
committee to select this year’s Junior Worthies for Men.

Junior Worthies are selected from the men and women
of the Junior class and honored annually at Tap Day. From
these.students a Senior Worthy is selected for men and

women.

In the past the group has served
as the selecting committee for its
successors, chaired by the Senior
Worthies and aided by representa-
tives from various school and ac-
tivity areas. ,

This‘ year Phil Parkinson, a
former Junior Worthy caused
some temporary confusion by
sending letters to presidents and
editors of various organizations
asking them to select the Junior‘
Worthies.

The letter was signed naming
Parkinson as chairman.

According to a member of the
committee which selected the
present Worthies, precedent held
that the group would select its
successors with outside help ap-
pointed by them.

Parkinson argued that the lack
of precedent prompted his action
and that several membersof last
year’s Junior Worthy group were
excluded from this selection com-
mittee intentionally because “we
can do without them.” ‘

The letter stated that if the
recipient of the letter could not
attend the meeting, he could
send a replacement. The only
qualiﬁcation stated for the re-
placement was that he be a sen-
ior man.

Congress ruled Monday that all

Junior Worthies will be present on
the committee for selection. No
ruling was made on the precedent-
breaking chairmanship of Parkin-
son.

A protest will be lodged on his
chairmanship at the selection
meeting on Thursday, Apr. 10, ac-
cording to several members of the
committee. ‘ B C

dents that funds will
available for the 1958
Award.

‘ All Junior men are urged to
apply by the committee chairman
Adam Sommerstein, Col. ’69.’

One of the purposes of the
Study-Travel Scholarship as ori-
gin_ally announced by Interfra-
ternity Council is to “encourage
widespread student interest in in-
ternational affairs.”

The deadline for applications "

is Apr. 9. Last year the presen-
tation of the ward to Ed Kolti-
ska, Bus. Ad. ’58, took place at
the “annual” Spring Common
Rooms Ball Apr, 6. ‘

Section ﬁve of the byi-law§iun-
der which the award is presented
states; “The annual grant given to
the Awarclee shall be determined
by the Standing Elections Com-
mittee before the person is select-
ed and s‘nall.not be less than $800

Last year’s awardee, Koltiska,
selected under the same provis-
ions, was awarded an amount sub-
stantially belowthis figum.

Koltiska states in relation to
this year’s grant: “It is vitally
important that the IF Council
insure sufficient funds for the
awardee before the selection is
made.

“This is the only way that the
award can be of value to‘ the

nwardee and IF. Traveling on a

‘S’h0estring makes it impossible
for a winner to grasp the full store
of knowledge that can be acquired
in such a short period of time.” s

F urman Repudiates
Low Tax Possibility

Lt. Gov. Roy Furman took the stand Friday that state

taxes cannot be lowered.

He spoke at a program sponsored by "the United Inde-
pendent Party held in the Student Union Ballroom.
Furman believes that since 50 cents of every tax dollar

goes into education, 30 cents into health and welfare, and

only 20 cents into running the:
state affairs, no feasible way exists
to lower taxes.

Seeks Co-operation

The gubernatorial candidate
in state government and the fact
that he strives for co-operation
with the “other party” as much as
possible.

He spoke of the emergency
tax measure he sponsored in the
state "legislature during the
height of the depression which
is “still on the books twenty .
years later.” He said he felt it
necessary to tax the people to
feed the people and rationalized
success of the taxation with the
fact that it has been continued.

Candidate Harold Stassen stated
at Pitt that muchgof the money
being channelled into the state
government is being wasted but
proposed extension of '/the, sales?
tax if necessary to carry out his,
program. 1

by the same group, but claimed
that it was a complete surprise to
him at the time. .

He asked several times rhetoric-
ally what is wrong “with my long
record of service to the state and

, nobody had told him the speciﬁc

reason for the dissatisfaction of

“I am perfectly willing to be

Kunde Enjoys Position As l\light Manager

Widely Travelled
In Mediterranean

By LORRAINE LESOON

The old adage ‘.‘No one is
indespensible” is not always
true. '

The falsehood in this state-
ment is exempliﬁed by Her-
bert Kunde, night manager
of the Student Union.

An illustration of the many jobs
the night manager has taken on
can be cited in a typical conversa-
tion between Kunde and a student
aid.

Aide Answers Phone .

“The te1ephone"is ringing Mr.
Kunde . . . Sit down Mr. Kunde
. . . I’ll answer it Mr. Kunde . . .
Which button do you push Mr.
Kunde? . . . Mr. Kundeeee, you’re
wanted on the telephone!”

He is able to relax only after
the whereabouts of the music
room is discovered,!a number of
room keys are distributed, di-
rections are given as to the vi-
cinity of eating places, and a
logical explanation is given as
to why the cigarette counter is
closed.

He was the assistant manager
of the former Schenley Hotel for
23 years before resuming his pres-
ent position at the University of
Pittsburgh.

While at the Schenley Hotel he
came into contact with such celeb-
rities as .Lily Pons, Janet Leigh,
Paul Douglas, Henry Fonda, Janet
McDonald, Marion Anderson, Ro-
berta Peters, and Isaac Stern.

Met Ball Players
He also met the players of such

'jprofessional ball teams as the New

 

Boss On The Nightbeat Kunde
A Good Memory For 23 Years In Hotel Work

York Yankees, Brooklyn Dodgers,
Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds and
the St. Louis Browns.

Kunde has also had the privi-
lege of meeting and talking to
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt. ~

Kunde points out that one of
the most important factors neces-
sary for success in the hotel busi-
ness is a good memory.,“Although

I would sometimes forget a name,

I would never forget a face.”

One of the guests of whom
Kunde has a vivid recollection is
the gentleman who, unable to
obtain an alcoholic beverage on
a Saturday evening, flew to
Mexico for a martini.

Although Kunde has travelled
all through Mediterrarean Europe,
and the Near East, and has met a
great numberof people, he has
yet to experience. anything more
thrilling than his day to day ad-
venture with‘ youth.

Kunde stated, “In the Student

Union there is never a dull mo-
ment and always a new experi-
ence. The students are very un-
derstanding and . appreciative of
whatever you do"! for them.”

Lauds Students

One of the characteristics of the
students that Kunde feels de-
serves recognition is their co-op-
erativeness. Kunde stated, “One
evening an elevator got stuck be-
tween ﬂoors in Schenley Hall. Stu-
dents clad in everything from
daytime attire to P.J.’s came run-
ning to the rescue.

Although their good intentions
were not utilized they were will-

Kunde believes “that his job is
not only to manage the Union but
to make the students feel as much
at home as possible. In his rare

moments of leisure he can be
found relating some of his past
experiences to the residents of
Schenley Hall,

He has a profound interest in
his work. Kunde said, “To meet

“Jockey brand underwear
made me a brighter star!”

“ ‘You can’t play Cyrano if you wear baggy underwear!’ the
drama coach told me. That was the day I bought my ﬁrst pair
of Jockey briefs. Quel ﬁt! Quel comfort! Ilooked better and,
amazingly, even my superb acting improved. Jockey briefs‘ had
made a dramatic change in my career!

g “Now I get all the starring roles, thanks to comfortable
Jockey brand underwear. And I wouldn’t think of accepting a
substitute. You see, only genuine Jockey brand briefs are tai-
lored from 13 separate, individually shaped pieces. That is the
reason they give you such a smooth, comfortable ﬁt!”
