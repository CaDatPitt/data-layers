Allegations about misuse of money don't affect board's operations

Lisa DiRenzo.
For The Pitt News

Student Government Board
members say the current alloca-
tions committee controversy
will not affect their day-to—day
operations.

"We're going to keep
moving on," said SGB President
Justin DalMolin.

All 10 members of the allo-
cations committee resigned last
week, stating in their resigna-
tion letter that they could no
longer stand "the gross misuse
and manipulation" of funds by
SGB officials and the alloca-
tions committee chairman,
Gerald Klayman.

The resigning members pro-
duced documentation showing
that DalMolin and other SGB
members spent hundreds of dol-
lars on food, cars and lodging
during several two-day trips to
Temple University.

DalMolin confirmed that he
did stay in a four-star hotel and
rented a Lincoln Town Car on
one of his visits to Temple.

Although the former alloca-

tions committee produced docu-

ments to prove its claims,
DalMolin believes that its accu-
sations are not true.

"Believe about 50 percent of
what you see and none of what
you hear," said DalMolin.

To give Klayman a chance
to clear his name of allegations
of wrong-doing, WPTS
Promotions Director Steven
Gasowski invited him and two
members of the former alloca-
tions committee, Jonathan
Boone and Joseph Mills, to dis-
cuss on Gasowski's weekly
radio talk show the appropria-
tion of allocations funds.

Boone and Mills declined
the invitation, but Klayman
accepted.

However, Klayman did not

     

show up for the talk show. He
said he wasn't able to be there
because of academic responsi-
bilities that "slipped his mind"

when he told ‘Gasowski he
would participate.
Because of Klayman's

‘absence, Gasowski called the

SGB office to speak to board
members about ’ the allocations
accusations.

Gasowski said he called the
SGB office approximately four
times in a two—hour period but
the SGB secretary repeatedly
told him that DalMolin and his
board were out of the office.

However, according to a
sign outside the SGB office,
board members David
Eisenberg, Brandi Miller, Ryan
Weidenmiller and Brian Riemer
all have office hours during the
time period that Gasowski
claims to have called.

"I was disappointed
Klayman did not show and no

She said

one from SGB could speak to
me," said Gasowski. "I gave
them a chance to defend them-
selves to the accusations facing
SGB and allocations."

In addition, the board avoid-
ed commenting on the allega-
tions at last week's SGB meet-
ing.

During the open-ﬂoor por-
tion of the meeting, one student
voiced her dismay about the
board's spending and said some
members of the board should
resign.

"We can discuss this after
the meeting," said DalMolin.
"The open ﬂoor is meant for,
comments."

After the meeting, though,
DalMolin went into his ofﬁce
for about 20 minutes before
anyone had an opportunity to
speak with him.

members expressed their "full support"
for their president and his actions.

"Justin is completely competent.
Screw them all." said Christa Douaihy,
the SGB president pro tempore.

SGB Business Manager Brian
Riemer reiterated his belief in
DalMolin's competence.

Some other students agreed with
DalMolin's board members.

"I back up the SGB," said Jamie
Maguire, a Pitt senior. "I think if stu-
dents knew all the details behind the
allocations scandal, they would not be
so critical."

She did not elaborate on her com-
ments.

Some students said an article in

last Monday's The Pitt News that
addressed the allocation committee's
walkout sided with the former commit-
tee members.

"I don't think this is a b1ack-and-
white issue," said Lisa Steinbruec, a
Pitt sophomore. "Allocations is a part
of SGB, and they're not perfect,
either."

Joyce Giangarlo, the associate
director for student activities, claims
the SGB will not be fazed by any alle-
gations and will continue to carry out
its plans. These plans include choosing
a Freshman Affairs Committee and
creating a Pitt-proud community.

"As far as I'm concerned," said
Giangarlo, "it's business as usual."

THE PITT NEWS

UPMC finally merges with
hospital in the North Side

Hillary Stevenson

Staff Wrlter

Telephone operators at the Passavant
Hospital use a new greeting when they
answer phone calls.

They now add the name of the hospi-
tal's new partner, the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center.

UPMC officials armounced Tuesday,
Sept.l6, that their medical empire now
reaches to Passavant's location in the
North Hills.

Passavant joins Shadyside Hospital,
St. Margaret's Hospital, the Aliquippa
Hospital and the Washington Hospital as
ones which have come under the UPMC
umbrella in recent years. The Passavant
Hospital will be known as UPMC
Passavant. A

The merger ends almost two years of
negotiations between the hospitals‘ admin-
istrators. It also signals the beginning of a
multirnillion—dol1ar con— I
struction program in the
community.

"A new era begins
today in the North Hills,"
said Ralph T. DeStefano,
president and chief execu-
tive officer of UPMC
Passavant, in a written
statement. "This joining
together of two strong
organizations that share a
common vision for the
future of health—care deliv-
ery in the region will
enhance our long-standing
service to the community."

UPMC President
Jeffrey Romoff said the
merger will improve the
service that the organization provides.

" [It's] only the beginning of the com-
mitment we have made to northern
Allegheny County. VV1th this partnership,
we seek to become the major provider of
health care in the area," said Romoff.

UPMC's affiliation with Passavant
began in 1995 when they signed an affili-
ation agreement. The accord made it pos-
sible for the two to cooperate on clinical
programs; the institutions started their
largest joint program, the University of
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, in July.

Robert Henderson, spokesman for
UPMC Passavant, said merger negotia-
tions began in November 1996. Last
January, Passavant's board of directors
wrote a letter of intent to merge with
UPMC.

"It is common for hospitals to merge
together and become a driving force in
health care. The consolidation of hospitals
across the country has been going on for a
few years now," stated Henderson.

He continued, "Here in Pittsburgh

you have Allegheny General and their

He said

pyramid system. You also see insurance
companies forming allegiances. It was
only a matter of time before it came to
Pittsburgh."

Passavant, a 272—bed facility, was
established in 1849 as the first Protestant
hospital in the United States. Henderson
said the personal approach to medicine
that Passavant patients are used to will
continue.

"Passavant will keep its community
ﬂavor," Henderson proclaimed.

Romoff added, "The ultimate beneﬁ-
ciaries will be the residents of the North
Hills, who will be able to take advantage
of the latest medical treatments and tech-
nology close to home."

The $138 million construction pro-
gram will add to the care residents expect
from Passavant. Romoff said renovations
should be finished by 1999.

There will be a three—story patient
wing added to the hospi-
tal's existing east wing. A
new office building, an
assisted—living facility and
a 400-car parking garage
also will be built.

"These are bold and nec-
essary plans which will
allow us to offer a contin-
uum of care by providing
comprehensive services
to a broad segment of the
community," said
DeStefano.

The clinical aspects of
the Passavant Hospital
shouldn't change, said
Conrad Coriato, employ-
ment manager at UPMC.

"We're not going to
inconvenience patients. For example,
we're not going to make them come all the
way from the North Hills just for an X-
ray," Coriato explained. "But we are going
to try to absorb administrative ﬁmctions."

Coriato said consolidating adminis-
trative tasks could result in job losses but
also create new opportunities.

"Employees have mixed emotions
about the merger. Whenever there is a
merger, most see it as an opportunity to
advance. However, not everyone is jump-
ing up and down for joy. Experience with
other mergers shows that there is mostly a
chance for an employee to grow," contin-
ued Coriato.

Henderson conducted a marketing
survey a few years ago in which North
Hills residents were asked how they
would feel about cooperating with
UPMC. Henderson noted that the survey
responses were favorable.

Quoting one community member,
Henderson said, "We have had the high
touch, now we'll also have the high-tech
touch."

PIZZA

I don’t think I’ll be buying from the ‘O’
anymore.”

However, the owner of the "O," Sid
Simon, said he hasn’t seen any decrease
in business since the price increase. He
pointed out that customers are still get-
ting a “good product at a good price.”

Simon cited the recent minimum-
wage increase from
$4.75 to $5.15 an
hour and the rising
product costs as rea-
sons for the 70—cent
per pizza increase.

He also pointed
out that the "O" has-
n’t raised its pizza
prices in three years.
“The cost of raw
materials went up,
but we didn’t raise
prices. We absorbed
it.”

FROM PAGE 1

When told that
Antoon’s offered a cheaper pie, Simon
said, “If they can afford it, God bless
‘em.”
Abraham thinks that Antoon’s will
be blessed and can afford to continue
selling its pizza at the lower price. “The
pizza’s going to stay that price for a
while,” he said.

Simon said that Antoon’s low prices
are just a tactic to draw in customers. “In
a year or two, they’ll be raising, too,” he

She said

  

THE PITT NEWS

said.

But for now, Antoon’s low prices are
good enough for many students. When
Rachael Lilienthal was told that pizza is
cheaper at Antoon's than the "O," she
said she would go to Antoon's.

Then she asked how late Antoon’s
stayed open. “Open ‘til two [a.m.]?
Umm  nice,” said the sophomore. “I’ll
deﬁnitely try it.”

Student Daniel Fradin
said that he knew Antoon's
' was cheaper, and, as a
result, he would try its
pizza.

"I like to try new
things," Fradin noted. '

Then the senior added,
"I think it's really odd that
the 'O' needed to raise
prices. They're open all the
time and are always busy.
But it's still a good d ."

‘ Both Antoon's and the
"O" sit relatively low on
‘ the pizza price scale com-
pared to other local establishments. For
example, the Pizza Outlet charges $9.62
for a 16-inch cheese pizza. A Papa John's
pie will set you back $8.35. Sorrento's
pizza is $7.50. And Larry & Carol's
pizza costs $7.40.

For some, the 70—cent increase at
the ‘'0'’ isn't really bothersome. Senior
A.J. Sharp said, "I really don't care and I
don't really understand how they kept
them so low anyway."

1959 —— Nikita S. Khrushchev, secre-
tary general of the Russian Communist
Party from 1953 to 1964, ended his
eight-day nationwide tour with a lun-
cheon in Pitt's Student Union Ballroom
and Supper Room.

Students and faculty members
viewed the luncheon proceedings over
numerous television monitors located
throughout the campus.

Five hundred guests attended the
luncheon and over 300 press corre-
spondents from around the world had a
luncheon of their own in the student-
union cafeteria.

Pennsylvania Governor David
Lawrence and Pittsburgh Mayor
Thomas Gallagher served as joint hosts
while Chancellor Litchﬁeld presided.

Outside of the luncheon,
Khrushchev's personal physician
toured the medical center as various
Russian officials met with members of
the faculty and administration at Pitt.

1989 — Pitt Police Chief William
Brennan was the focus of an internal
investigation concerning questionable
promotion techniques he used while
director. Charges of sexual harassment
were also included in the inquiry.
Months prior to the investigation,
Brennan revamped the promotion
process "to pick the people who are the

THIS WEEK IN Pm HISTORY

most attuned to our new service philos-
ophy."

Some believed Brennan coached
certain officers before they appeared
before the promotion board, evaded
promotional guidelines and promised
jobs without providing them.

Female employees also said that
the language they encountered while on
the job was "too loose and offensive."

While the investigation was under
way, the department continued to oper-
ate according to normal procedures.

1995 — In one of the largest alcohol
raids in recent Pennsylvania State
Police history, officers arrested over
200 Pitt students cited for underage
drinking at Zelda's Greenhouse, a
South Bouquet Street bar which has
since been closed.

The raid was a result of an under-
cover operation initiated by the Bureau
of Liquor Control Enforcement.

Fo1ty—three minors and another
210 individuals who turned out to be
minors with improper identiﬁcation
were cited.

The owner of Zelda's, along with
10 other employees, was charged with
selling alcohol to minors and gambling,
said state police.

Across the Nation

ANNAPOLIS, Md. — A North Carolina
medical researcher says that healthy ﬁsh
caught in toxic waters could develop lesions
after leaving the water.

Joanne Burkholder, a professor at North
Carolina State University, spoke Monday at
the ﬁrst meeting of a panel formed to discuss
the ﬁsh—killing microbe affecting several
states, including Pennsylvania.

The panel expects to meet for six weeks
and propose a policy for battling the bacteria
pﬁesteria. The organism is known to kill ﬁsh
and is believed to cause short-term memory
loss in humans.

Burkholder said that anglers should wait
a day before eating ﬁsh they catch, to deter-
mine if the ﬁsh are healthy.

The governors I of Maryland, West
Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina,
Pemrsylvania and Delaware agreed Friday to
lobby the federal government for help in
tackling the microbe.

that nothing took place between Albert and

He also described Albert's accuser as
someone who , "collected" celebrities and
who bragged about her relationships with
media personalities. .

"Being a celebrity is not enough to con-

Doctors will test AIDS
vaccine on themselves

About 50 very couragwus people may help prevent
the world from bexzoming infected with AIDS.

A group of doctors and public-health advocates have
volunteered to be the ﬁrst humans to be injected with a
weakened strain of HIV. They say thatAIDS research is
important enough for them to risk their lives testing a vac-
cine. Frfty healthy people are willing to contract the virus
in hopes of ﬁnding a viable way to prevent AIDS.

We applaud them

It takes a lot of courage to volunteer for something
like this. According to a doctor who has volunteered, few
have the bravery to step up, and that is why vaccine devel-
oprnent has proceeded so slowly until now.

Not many scientists have worked on developing vac-
cines because most don’t expect anyone to volunteer as a
human guinea pig. VV1th that assumed roadblock, recent
research has focused on treatment and therapy instead.

A vaccine is not really a cure; it’s a prevention. A vac-
cine infects people with weakened HIV to prevent them
from getting a stronger strain that could lead to AIDS.

Protease inhibitors are the main focus of treatment
research now. These drugs, in many cases, have been able
to all but remove every trace of HIV from the blood-
streams of infected persons, and the drugs are being

improved constantly. But protease inhibitors are treat-

ments intended for after infection. They are not preven-
tion.

Condoms may provide statistically effective preven-
tion, but they are not 100-percent effective. And there is
always the remote possibility, especially with a virus that
is so widespread, of HIV becoming airbome.

Contrary to what many believe, ending the threat of
AIDS would not mean that prorrriscuity would overtake
the world There are plenty of other sexually transmitted
diseases for everybody to worry about, and plenty of other
reasons to practice monogamy, safe sex or abstinence. We
are not talking about making the world safe for carefree
sex. We’re talking about making the world safer for
human life.

Itreaﬂirms our faith inhumanity thatso many healthy
physicians risk their lives to ﬁnd a cure.

Wewishthemthebest,andextendourthankstoﬂrem
for their selﬂess compassion.

OPINIONS

I hate bad news.

As a member of society, I’d much
rather hear that the status quo is just
ﬁne. But as a member of the media, my
hope for universal benevolence is a tad
bit selﬁsh

Every time someone does some-
thing wrong, people get angry at the
press for covering it.

Since we broke a story last week
about the student govemment’s
$11,0()0 summer, I’ve gotten many
angry letters stating The Pitt News
should not have bothered to investigate,
let alone print, such a thing.

What a load of nonsense.

The story was about how all 10
members of the allocations committee
resigned to protest what they consider
excessive spending of student funds by
SGB President Justin DalMolin during
the summer.

The committee questioned ﬂights
around the state, expensive rental cars,
a weekend getaway, enormous costs for
food, bands, T-shirts and parking
spaces. They thought these were just
extravagant perks that SGB felt like
giving itself. V

They produced documents prov-
ing these expenditures occurred, and
they felt strongly enough about the
matter to resign —-—- en rnasse.

But people still said I shouldn’t
have written about it One gentleman
from Pitt’s marketing deparlrnent said
articles like mine cause low alumni
donations.

Itamazesrnethatpeoplethinkwe
should ignore the protest of 10 people
who worked in SGB for years, or brush
off students whose job was to make
sure that money was spent properly.

The committee already has a his-
tory of being ignored by SGB. Last
year, student—govemment ofﬁcials
spent thousands of dollars on lobbying
efforts around the country despite the

      

The Pitt News

objections of the allocations committee.
SGB spent thousands on a dinner at the
end of the year, again ignoring the
protests of the allocations committee.

When the committee came back
this year to see how much money was
spent over the summer by their boss,
Allocations Chair Gerald Klayrrran,
and by SGB President Justin DalMolin,
they just couldn’t accept it anymore.

DalMolin says he spent the money
visiting other colleges to start a
Pennsylvania student lobbying effort,
which, frankly, is a great idea.

But the outrageous sums of money
DalMolin spent on things like ﬂights to
Philadelphia, Lincoln Town Cars and
four-star hotels are the issue.

The allocations committee’s job is
to monitor spending. Its members ques-
tioned why DalMolin spent thousands
of dollars on these trips when he could
have spent a fraction of that cost renting
a University car, driving to Philadelphia
and staying at a Holiday Inn.

Throughout the three-hour inter-
view, DalMolin could say only that
these things were “for the good of the
students.” He also said he wrote per-
sonal checks giving whatever he didn’t
spend on those trips back to the activi-
ties fund. Unfortunately, he can’t pro-
vide canceled checks to prove it.

DalMolin paid for a $170 parking
space with student frmds, even though
Pitt was willing to supply him with one
for free. DalMolin says this was a mis-
take. Klayrnan also took a parking
space. He says he needed it because he
spent so much time in the student-gov-
ernment office.

I believe him. He sure had a lot of
documents with his signature on them.

The committee took issue with the
way SGB “bent the rules.” For exam-
ple, SGB held a $5,000 concert and
printed up more than $1,000 worth of
T-shirts in the past few weeks -— both
expenses that no other group is
allowed. This makes things diﬂicult for
the committee when it has to turn down

essenger for bad news

other groups for ﬂre same things.

DalMolin said SGB shouldn’t
have to follow those rules and that the
committee has no authority to make
SGB obey it.

Then there is the photo.

It was a sensational photo, no
question —— but it was not sensational-
ism, as some believe.

First of all, this was not some can-
did photo pulled from the depths of
someone’s drawer. The SGB members
posed for this photo, and made sure that

two things were clear". They were hav- .

ing a great time, and they were holding
cans of beer.

Then they posted about a dozen
copies of the photo around their oﬂice,
on bulletin boards and at desks. Their
adviser, Joyce Giangarlo, even had one
hanging on her oﬂice wall.

Funny thing to decorate an oﬂice
with considering it makes the whole
trip look like a junket.

Yesterday, Pitt officials said SGB
should have spent its money better but
that it didn’t violate any nrles.

But what happened to all of this
money? Why doesn’t DalMolin show
some receipts and ask his bank for
some shred of evidence that he gave
back surplus frmds ﬁorn these trips?

Why are people ignoring the con-
ﬂict of interest in this situation? SGB’s
budget should be separate from the
activities fund if SGB wants to control
the fund.

The fools who say the press is
responsible for making people “feel
bad” about Pitt should consider such
questions — after all, it’s their money
being spent on luxury cars and extrava-
gant getaways.

Nobody likes bad news. But good
or bad, it’s our responsibility to report it.
It’s your job to decide whether you
care.

Well, the football polls are out.

In recent years, telling a Pitt student that
"The football polls are out” was like telling
Bachman-Turner Overdrive that Billboard
had released its most recent Top 40 chart list.
While I don’t pretend to understand the col-
lective psyche of Bachman-Tumer Overdrive,
I would guess that its members’ reactions
ranged from “So what?” to “Hey, we were on
that list once.”

Such was this school’s reaction. Until
now. '

The Associated Press, the world’s most
esteemed group of journalists, with the excep-
tion of the Weeldy World News stalf, ranks the
top 25 Division I college-football teams after
each week of action. ,

Pitt, sorry to say, didn’t make the list.

However, the AP is a diverse group of I

writers, some of whom have vastly dilferent
opinions than others on football. For instance,
while one writer might vote Penn State the top
team in the nation, another writer might not be
so stupid.

So, there are invariably some teams that
receive votes in the poll but do not crack the
overall 25—team list.

The fourth team on that non—Top 25 list,
we at The Pitt News are proud to report, is the
University of Pittsburgh Panthers.

This makes us ranked 29th in the country,
thanks to 26 votes cast by AP writers who
probably caught a little bit of our
Homecoming magic on ESPN.

As an added bonus, we’re leading»

Wyoming! They’re 30th. Unfortunately, the
hated Golden Eagles of Southern Mississippi
are ahead of us by 40 votes in the 28th spot.

North Carolina State and Air Force make
up the rest of the also-rans ahead of Pitt, and
Arizona’s 177 votes were enough for it to
crack this week’s Top 25.

In other words, we’re four-bad-ga1nes-
by-ranked-opponents away from national
respectability, an assured bowl berth and Pete
Gonzalez doing SportsCenter commercials.

Unfortunately, other polls aren’t as nice.

used to be the USA Today/CNN poll, which
used to be The United Press International poll,

this ranking, whileAir Force’s 120 points beat
Pitt by 107 and get it into the Top 25.

Volleyball takes
Tennessee tourney

Matt Grove

Staff Writer

Military units are often
characterized as having a
strong “esprit de corps” — a
belief in preparing oneself
for battle, giving one’s best
and never letting a fellow
soldier down.

Similarly, after a recent
team meeting, the Pittsburgh
Lady Panthers volleyball
team votedto choose “esprit
de corps” as its motto.

The team lived up to its
motto this past weekend.

Pitt raised its record to
6-4 with a pair of wins over
Tennessee and Iowa in the
Tennessee Tournament. The
Lady Panthers downed the
host Lady Volunteers in a
grueling ﬁve-set match
Friday night: 8-15, 12-15,
15-2, 15-13 and 17-15.

“We really turned a 180
this weekend against some
great competition. The idea
of ‘esprit de corps’ instills
the idea to do your best
every day and be ready for
battle,” said Head Coach

Cindy Alvear. “That’s going

to be what Pittsburgh volley-

ball is.” . .
Alvear said that as the

Lady Panthers watched the
‘football team upset Miami

Thursday night, they felt a
sense of pride in their
school, and that the victory
really changed the team’s
psyche.

“When you get a boost
like that from a fellow team,
it’s great,” said the coach.
“They don’t care what any-
one thinks; they just go and
do what needs to be done.”

Freshman Marcia
Thiesen, who was named to
her second all—toumament
team, and sophomore team-
mate Paula Zemrowski led a
balanced Pittsburgh attack.
Thiesen, a 5-foot—1 1-inch
outside hitter, led the
Panthers with 16 kills and 25
digs, while Zemrowski
added 16 kills and nine digs.

Junior Jessica Van Der
Mallie (15 kills)‘ and fresh-
man Stacy Renick (13 kills)
were also named to the all-
tournament team. Junior

Tara Haefner, the touma-
ment MVP, had a game-high
59 assists in the win.
Tennessee had four
players in double-digit kills:
Chris J estilla (19), Kelly
Hanlon and Kim Obiala (13)
and Courtney Huettemann
(12). Allison Stricklin added
a team-high 57 assists for
the Lady Vols, who dropped

Von D Mill (finishing the spike) had 16 kills vs. Tennessee.

 
      

to 3-9.

In the championship
game on Saturday, Pitt
defeated Iowa in straight
sets, 15-9, 15-9 and 15-7.
Once again Thiesen,
Zernrowski, Van Der Mallie
and Haefner led the way for
Pitt.

College to 0-0 tie

Patrick Robertson

Staff Writer
The Pittsburgh men’s soccer team maintained its

 

undefeated record by tying Boston College 0-0 on
Saturday. The scoreless tie raised Pitt to 3-0-3 overall,
and 2-0-2 in the Big East.

The Panthers battled the Eagles in the midﬁeld for
most of the game, with neither side making much of an
offensive push.

“This team [BC] is very similar to Notre Dame,”
said Pitt Head Coach Joe Luxbacher. “They are big,
strong and toug .” Pittsburgh also tied the
defending Big East champs, the Fighting Irish, in the
Panthers’ conference opener. The score of that contest
was 0-0. '

Saturday’s weather was not good soccer weather
—— constant rain and cold temperatures -- and both
teams had trouble controlling the ball.

“The wet turf made it tough, but both teams had to
deal with it,” said Luxbacher.

The University of Pittsburgh
women’s soccer team traveled to the
University of California at Irvine to play
in the Nike/UCI Invitational last week-
end. It ﬁnished the weekend with a 3-0
loss to host UC Irvine and a l -1 tie against
Oregon State in the four-team tournament
at Anteater Field.

Irvine went up early in the first game.
Nicole Bucciarelli netted her sixth goal of
the season and gave UCI a 1-0 lead it took
to the half. She got a cross—ﬁeld pass from
Michelle Kaping and blasted it into the
net.

Irvine had 14 shots on goal in the first
half, compared to Pitt’s one. Panther
keeper Ilene Ravich made six saves in the
first half to keep the game close.

The Panthers fared no better in the
second half. They took only two more
shots, to ﬁnish the day with just three
attempts at the UCI net. UC Irvine blast-
ed l0 more shots at Ravich, who made
ﬁve saves in the half.

Freshman Stephanie Rigamat scored
for the Anteaters from six yards out at
51:58 on an assist from Bucciarelli and
Danica Holt. Laura Lamb added Irvine’s
final goal at 74:12, with a shot from the
left, about 18 yards from the net.

The Anteaters’ keeper, Kristen Roy,
recorded her third shutout of the young

season. She combined with Jennifer

Roy only made two saves on the
night, as opposed to Ravich’s 11. The
Anteaters racked up 24 shots on goal,
overwhehning the Panther defense with
the most tries against its goal since Notre
Dame took 36 shots in its Sept. 12 game
against Pitt.

On the same night, Brigham Young
University blanked Oregon State 1-0 to
set up a match between the Lady Panthers
and the Lady Beavers. Against OSU, the
BYU Cougars scored the game’s only
goal, with fewer than 90 seconds remain-
ing, to advance to the ﬁnals.

BYU came into the tournament as the
only ranked team —— No. 15 — to be
invited.

Pitt Head Coach Roland Sturk started
Nicole Bashor in his net this game with
hopes of a more favorable result. The
Panther offense responded by blasting 17
shots at Beaver netminder Kristen
Dulacki.

OSU got on the scoreboard first with
a Libby Christensen goal at 33:27. She
headed the ball past Bashor off an assist
from Lindsay Allori. Bashor had left the
net and made it an easy target.

In the 56th rriinute, Pitt midﬁelder
Rachel Beitges set up a Renee
Spampinato goal. Sparnpinato blasted a
shot from six yards out to tie the game.

That goal ended the scoring for the
game, resulting in a 1-1 tie. Bashor ﬁn-
ished with seven saves and Dulacki
turned away eight Panther shots.

The Panthers still gave up 18 shots,
but they managed to squeak out the tie
anyway. Vanessa Madison led the Lady
Panthers with three shots on their way to
17 total tries.

BYU beat the home team to win the
round—robin tournament. The Lady
Panthers’ losses in the tournament
dropped them to 1-4-2 on the season.

The Pitt women will start the meat of
their Big East schedule with three confer-
ence away games then return home to
play in the Backyard Brawl on Oct. 8

against West Virginia.

cares about.

What do all these numbers mean?

Not much, truthfully. Being ranked 29th
in the country doesn’t win us any real prizes.
It’s doubtful the Associated Press will even
chip in and buy us a new north-end—zone
goal post.

It is, though, a national reﬂection of the
college atmosphere that had its genesis with
the Southwestern Louisiana game and its
coming—out party at Homecoming.

Top 25 teams do the kind of stuff Pitt
has started doing this season, both on and off
the football ﬁeld Among these are:

- Holding leads against good opponents and
bad opponents. ‘

- Forcing turnovers when they need to force
turnovers.

- Winning at home.

0 Inviting the Golden Knights to parachute in
on Homecoming.

- Losing at Penn State.

0 Copying the entrance music and video
montage from the Chicago Bulls so blatant-
ly that fans half expect Phil Jackson instead
of Walt Harris to emerge from the tunnel.

0 Allowing fans to tear down a goal post.

0 Changing logos. .

0 Having the athletics director install a really,
really expensive scoreboard, and using it to
run interviews with the athletics director.

- Most importantly, winning on
Homecoming, in front of 40,000 people.

When a number of those 40,0()0 people
descended onto the Pit Stadium turf, we saw
another important facet of Top 25 football —
a student body that cares about its football
program. _

Panther football is no longer one of
many unattractive Options for a Saturday
afternoon or a Thursday night. Last
Thursday made this obvious to any remain-
ing skeptics.

Not to overdo it, but the view from the
press box was staggering. The student sec-
tion, which was ﬁlled to the rim of the stadi-

um, was pouring out more noise than a 747
jet taking off in the middle of an Ozzy
Osbourne conceit.

The noise reached its crescendo after
John Jenkins stepped in front of Ryan
Clement’s last pass of the ballgame. The
clamor then divided into two groups: one of
mass hysteiia, and the other of still—level—
headed football fans who shouted to Jenkins,
“Get down! Get down before you fumble!”

0 Finally, Jenkins fell over. The crowd
screamed in unison. A

Then, the preparations for the onslaught
began. Police farmed out across the ﬁeld
Students began pushing against the railing.
Gonzalez began kneeling the ball.

The press box’s occupants began wor-
rying — according to the clock and the num~
ber of Hunicane timeouts remaining, it

would be necessary for the Panthers to punt,

the ball away on fourth down and thus give
the Hurricanes one last chance at a victory.

This just goes to show you that people
in the press box can be idiots. The clock ran
out despite our calculations, and the fans‘
began to swarm toward the middle of the
ﬁeld. They then started breaking olf toward
the unguarded goal post, and proceeded to
break it.

A The mass hysteria was deafening.
Reporters were on their feet in silence, ignor-
ing their duty to pursue the objective truth.
Instead, they were staring in awe at the mass
of Panther pride.

“I never thought I’d see  said a
reporter to my left. The reporter to my right
had already gone down to rush the ﬁeld.

“Is this great or what?” he asked later.

It was great. And for one night, regard-
less of what national polls will tell you, we

ed with a full-extension dive, which just

tipped the ball away from going to a

wide-open Eagle.

Kopp had the night’s best shot at a
goal. Garry crossed the ball in front of the
net and Kopp headed the ball just out of
reach of the Boston College goalie —— and
right over the crossbar.

“We played hard, but didn’t use the
ball as well as we should have,” noted
Luxbacher.

In the second half, BC opened play’
with a 35-yard blast that just cleared the
top of the Panther net. It would be the
best chance for either team for most of
the period.

Boston College had a comer kick late
in the game. The Eagles had a chance, but
Pitt defenseman Chuck Kotuby made a
great save by knocking the ball just wide
of the post.

“Chuck was where he should have
been. That’s how we drew it up,” said
Luxbacher.

After the teams battled for 60 score-
less minutes, they began their first over-
time period. After neither team scored in
the 15-minute period, the teams began a
second overtime. It yielded an identical
result, so the game was called a draw.

“That’s not what we wanted, but we
have to take it,” Luxbacher said of the tie.

The result kept the Panthers in a good
position in the Big East and maintained
their undefeated record. According to
Luxbacher, all of the teams in the confer-
ence are playing well, so there should be
some upsets this year.

Pittsburgh faces another test Friday
when it plays at home against Big East
Conference member Rutgers. This will
be the first of two conference contests
over the weekend. The Villanova
Wildcats come to Pitt Stadium for a 1:00
matinee on Sunday, Sept. 28.
