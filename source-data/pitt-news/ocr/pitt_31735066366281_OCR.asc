SG Senators Support,  
(Denounce Eric Stern’s
Unexpected Move

By NANCY FUCHS
The Student Government
(SG) Senate's reaction to
the resignation of President

Eric Stern was one of sur-
"prise and sadness mingled

with hope and conﬁdence in
SG’s ability to carry on. In a
statement circulated on. campus
Friday, Stern expressed his wish
to “help create a Student Gov-
ernment which will be a viable
government” outside the frame.
work of that body. ‘ U

Senator Jim " Janis, whose bill
‘was the impetus for Stern’s res-
ignation, said that “I am very
sorry to see a President resign
because we do not agree with his
position.

, “I know, however, that the Stu-
dent Government can continue to
be inﬂuential in the area of stu-
dent affairs,” he added. “I shall
not resign because I believe in
this basic principle.”

Senator Charles Hollander said,
“Should Eric's resignation stand,
I think it would be the most un-
fortunate event concerning SG
this entire year because a person
can only ﬁght for what he wants
within the body that can accom-
‘pnsh it.” ' ‘ "

He felt the “Senate has sealed
its fate as a representative body
for, the students. It has rather
accepted a status as an advisory
committee for the administra-
tion.”

Senator John Ruskay, chair-

man of the P-itt Progressive Par- -

ty,' announced that “although we,
have failed to convince the en-
tire Student Government of our
basic philosophy, we shall stay
in (SG) and continue to use every
available means to make Student
Government the only representa-
tive body of the students."
Calling it “unwise for Eric
Stern ‘to resign because the Sen-
ate did not comply with his

views,” Senator Toby Sandler felt '

“conﬁdent that SG will adjust to
this ‘votatile’ situation and‘ be-
come a properly functioning body

’ allocate the activities fee.”

under the worthy leadership of
Jerry Hogan and Marcia Bern-
stein.” '
Vice-President Marchia Bern-
stein described herself as “shock-
ed, saddened, and even a little
frightened‘ by tonight’s (Thurs-
day's) proceedings. I do not feel,
however, that this is the end of .
Student Government here.
' “I have faith and conﬁdence in
this group that remained,” she
continued. “I am sure that under
the leadership of Jerry Hogan we
can at least lay the basis for a
strong Student Government in fu-
ture years and carry out\,all the
business before us in a principled
and efficient manner.”
President H0£an expressed his
“great respect and deep appre-
ciation for the members of _\the
Senate who remained.” He prom-
ised to present the details of the
various programs which need to
be started in this 'week’s (Thurs-
da-y’s) Presidential report. V
Stem’s statement to the stu-
dents explained his reasons for
resigning. The statement read:
“As president of Student Govern- _
ment I was only a ﬁgurehead for
a "government which does not
represent the wishes of its elec-
torate.” ' '

Stern ‘called SG’s relationship
to the administration “servile, It.
misrepresents students by seat-
ing vice-presidents of selected or-
ganizations. It has refused, in the
face of administrative opposition,
to maintain its original position

demanding a referendum on this.
issue. Student. Government has
reduced itself to an unpaid em- ’
ployee performing clerical work
for the" University.” '

Of the two senators who walk-
ed out of Thursday’s meeting in
sympathy with Stern, Jerry Ro-
sen has announced his intention
to remain in the senate and Rich-
ard Shweder described his posi-

tion as “indeterminate.” ’

NEW STUDENT"

By NANCY FUCHS

Student Government (SG)
President Jerry Hogan and
Vice-President Marcia Bern-
stein took their oaths of of-
fice before a group of sena-
. tors, -advisors, and interested
students in the SG office, Friday.

According to Hogan, the oath
was administered to give SG an
official ‘head. Former SG Presi
dent Eric Stern" told Hogan he

would submit a written resigna- -

tion to be read at Thursday’s SG
meeting.

‘Stern resigned his position as
SG President at last Thursday's
meeting after the passage of a
bill establishing a method of se-
lection of two members for the
student activities fee allocation
committee.

Calling the Senate “a mere fac-»

ade for democracy,” he an-
nounced that he did not “choose
to be axiigurehead for a demo-
cracy that does not exist. I here-

JOHN RUSKAY
Against Motion

«. (Continued from Page ‘1)

The bill states that it
'~‘»‘,akes precedence over any
other legislation passed by

the 1965-66 Student Gov-
ernment Senate which deals
with this subject.

‘The-debate on the bill center-
ed_j_ around the student referen-

 proposal‘ which had been
defeated at the Sept. 23 SG meet-

tudent body to choose either, an
llocations committee selected
fl part~by both so and Student
_fl?airs Committee. Stern, in his
residential report, urged pass-.
age..of the referendum to give
udents a chance to express their
L pproximately 739 students had
adsigned a petition urging the
enators’ to have a student refer-
_ndum. Stern asked: “Are we to
eny these students the right to
.ote on an issue they want to
ote on?” He answered: “If we
6, we are not a democracy.”
Many senators had prepared
eeches on the question of the
llocations committee; and a stu-
ent referendum. Senator Janis
id: “We are not debating the
iiethod of selecting a. committee;
 are debating the basic prin-

ciples of what a Student Govern-
ment should be at the University
of Pittsburgh.” Heurged the Sen-
ate to accept the decision of Vice-
Chancellor, of Student Affairs
Helen Rush-, who ruled that the
solely SG-selected allocations
committee was unacceptable “be-
cause we have sworn to obey the
constitution.”

The constitution was under ﬁre
by some senators who did not
consider it binding because there
is no veriﬁcation of its ratiﬁca-
tion by the student body.’

Janis suggested that after the
allocations committee is estab-
lished, SG should draw up a_new
constittuion giving itself the
rights _to be the “sole decision-
maker in certain, deﬁned areas of
student activities.” This constitu-
tion would be taken to the Sen.
ate and then to the student body
in a referendum. ‘

Senator Charles Hollander,

countered the argument of Sena-
tor Janis with the statement: “It

is the democratic and right dc: ‘

cision to pay no heed, in this case,
to an administraitve dictate. . . .
To go along with the decision
reached by the administration in
this case is to deny our own
constitution.

mary responsibiliity of SG is to '

In reply Senator Martin En-
gels asked_ “what difference it

ment does, since, in either case,
it’s going ‘to be student repre-
senting students . . . taxation
with representation.”

He ‘explained that when he
asked. Senator Shweder what
would ’happen—if the Administra-
tion ignored the results of a. stu-
dent referendum, Shweder pre-
dicted a “volatile situation.” En-
gels speculated , that a “volatile
situation” might mean sit-ins,
riots, pickets, or demonstrations.
He felt all were undesirable.

“If we let this referendum go
through,.no matter how large or
small the vote, We are helping
to create that ‘volatile situation’
which I’m sure very few want,”
Engels concluded. Students in the
.audience hissed’ at Senator En-
‘gels’ remarks.

Senator Ruskay demanded the
Senate “demonstrate that a Stu-
dent Government at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh can_ and must
be more than advisers. If we ac-
cept this veto from the adminis-
tration we accept the role of ad-
viser.” Therefore, he said, “Let
us call for .a referendum of the

' student body because it is right.”

he refused to name any profes-
sors with whom he is dissatisﬁed
Dean Halliday appraised Profes-
sor Kenneth Cummins of the bio-
logy department as “the ideal
person to teach the course” and
said that the opinion of the stu-
dents was that it was “a smash-
ing course.”

As for the courses which are
being taught poorly, Dean Halli-
day suggested that perhaps, until
better suited professors are found,
a. few courses should be drop-
ped from the curriculum. The
number of courses to be. dropped
would be only “one or two at
the most.”

Dr. James Kehl, new clean of
liberal arts, in speaking of the
possibility of future improve-
ment of present professors, felt
that “any man who has pride
will try ,to improve” and that
“it’s not wise to exercise a ‘club’

He warned the students against
expecting any immediate drastic
changes: “You can’t call up Pro-
fessors X and tell him to make
his presentation more provoca-
tive” and expect him “to change
overnight.”

Speaking of the size of the en-

in the natural science depart-
ment, Dean Halliday pointed out
the large discrepancy in equal
interests. In psychology 80 there
is an enrollment of about 400,
whereas in physics there are
only ten or 12 students enrolled.
Although he found the students
to be fairly correct in their eval-
»uation of most of the courses,
Dean Halliday was very disap-
proving of the methods used by
the students to come to their con-
clusions. He said, “Evaluation of
teaching is one of the most diffi-
cult tasks a department head or
dean has to face,” and that they
“can use help and advice. Great
harm can be done if this is done
in an irresponsible manner.”
As an example of the evalua-
tion being done in an “irrespon-
sible manner,” Dean Halliday
said the students spoke to only
ten students out of .a class of 180
and that this was a “very poor
sample. The only rational thing
to do is to ask every student in
the class, a 100 per cent sam-
ple.’«’-He also suggested that the
“students should have profes-
sional advice,” perhaps by em-
ploying the testing service of the
Department of Psychology. Dean.

Halliday felt that the students '

should “keep it up but do a bet-
ter job.”#_A,_,

 Eric Stern has made his, ﬁrst constructive contribution to Student
Government (SG) by resigning as president. Under his guidance, Student
Government became stagnant for its first six months of the year.
 Stern’s mere absence does not mean an automatic rejuvination of
”St',udent Govermnent. Jerry Hogan must provide the leadership SG lacked
in-der Stern.
0 He must not hesitate; he must act. He must not be indecisive; he
must decide. He must not be meak; he must be aggressive. He must not
it and philosophize, he must stand and act. ,
0, The starting point is obvious. Hogan must present his legislative
utline to the Senate this week to begin guiding SG from regression to
ccomplishment. -
_ Four long-range issues must take priority :‘ allocation of the activities
05 ee, .constitutional revision, revision of the University Handbdok, and re-
evaluation of the relation of SG and Student Affairs Committee. If SG
3‘does not complete these four tasks this year, _it will have accomplished
(nothing, even without Stern. V A
Two‘ members for the allocations committee should be selected, the
:‘cornmittee’s criteria established; and organizations notified of requirements.
The allocations can be completed by the end of this trimester.

, The validity of the SG constitution has been questioned. Whether it
divas ratified or not six years ago does not affect its being obsolete now.
Open contradictions exist between the,,SG constitution and the University
lhaﬁdbook. There are also several areas’ where the constitution either makes
noiprovisions or is unclear. ‘ ' E

For example, the University handbook places Student Affairs above
SG. The SG constitution makes SG the sole representative body of stu-
dents. The University handbook restricts SG authority to those areas not

‘covered _by other student organizations. If a question of jurisdiction arises,

-he Council was to disband it, which he could -do by simply

_  As the news of the Emperor’s action came to the Coun-
il, the old Scribe rose, his body shaking with anger, and
ried, “I have recorded many Councils and they have always
   served your Emperor well. Do not think for
a moment that what John tells you are his
real reasons for hating this group. You chal-
lenge his power but in a different way from
that which he claims.” .
 “YOU CAN never really subvert his power
"j for he still controls the armies of your
 realms, He hates the Council because it is
ﬁlled with noblemen and noblewomen of dig-
nity, who are of a quality equaling that of

the SG constitution gives SG precedence over any other student organiza-
tion. »
‘Also, the SG constitution fails to delineate fhe precise role of the
President as representative of the senate and specifies no procedures in
cases. of resignation.

While the SG constitution can be revised by an SG committee, a com-
mittee of SG Senators, faculty, and administrators should be established
to revise the University handbook. Policies are outdated, poorly phrased,
and insufficient.

The SG President and Vice-President and other members of the Stu-
dent Affairs committee should prepare a joint resolution revising the rela-
tion between SG and Student Affairs. The abolition of Student Affairs and
placement of its student members in SG should be given,thorough consid-
eration.

Besides the long-range issues, SG must resolve numerous short-range
problems. Homecoming is currently meandering its way to failure. The
Spirit Award was dropped withouticareful evaluation..

A student-library committee was approved three weeks ago; no one
has been appointed. The Liberal Arts ‘Cabinet has not been formed. Last
year interest in student savings at the Book Center reached a high momen-
tum, nothing has been done this year. ‘ A i

Student Government has been rightfully asserting its rights to more
jurisdiction, only the means have been wrong. Opportunities still exist.
The potential of SG senators still exists. A leader is the necessary element.

Stern Explains Resignation

The following is a letter circu-
lated by Eric Stern, Friday, the
day after his resignation as Stu-
dent Government President? 'I t is
printed in its entirety.

I owe to you, the Students of
this University, an explanation-
an explanation of Why I resigned
from the presidency of Student
Government. The. reasons are

quite simple.

As president of Student Gov-

ernment I was only a ﬁgurehead

for a government which does not
represent the wishes of its elec-
torate. Its relationship to the
administration has been servile.
It mis-represents students by seat-
ing vice-presidents of selected
organizations. It has refused, in

_ the face of administrative opposi-

tion, to maintain its original posi-
tion that Student Government
should allocate the Activities Fee.
_It has ignored ‘a petition signed
by 800 students demanding a ref-
rendum on this issue. Student
Government has reduced itself to
an unpaid employee performing

clerical work for the University.

For these reasons, it is impos-
sible for me to honestly repre.
sent the students who voted for
me and still retain my position
in Student Government. How-
ever, it is still my duty to serve
you as best I can, to represent
student interests, and to help

create a Student Government.
which will be a viable govern-

‘ment. I shall do so.”

DOWN ANDV our

,, ‘ . "DURHAM, N. C., OCT. 9 — It was evident what was
wrong with the Panthers on Saturday, the best men on the

uad weren't in the line-up at all times. The most obvious
imes were when Duke had the ball.

According to Blue Devil Coach Bill Murray, “thetdown
d out pass has been our bread and ‘butter’ play for ﬁve
ears.” The Panther coaches knew it, the players knew it,
'u_t Duke still had little trouble completing the pass every
1me they tried it. » ‘
 Granted the down and out pass is one of the toughest
fasses to defend against, but adjustments -can be made when
it is completed six times in a row. The Duke receiver was
far from nimble footed when he ran his pattern. Many times
 he pattern was so evident that it couldbe seen by anyone
.,in the stands.

’ IF THE PASS PROTECTION was bad then the pass
ush was worse. Panthers expected a running game from
. he Blue Devils, and must have forgotten to put the pressure
K‘ n the passer while they looked for an imaginary ball car-
rier to tackle.

_ "There is not'a team on the schedule that will not now
‘ pass against the Panthers, and they are foolish if they don’t.
Scotty Glacken had so much time to pass and spot his re-
ceivers that he even turned and smiled at‘ the TV cameras
{once or twice while dropping back.

. The Panthers aren't ready for two platoon football if
 ,‘that’s the best defensive unit they can put in. If other
 coaches can play the best men they have when the situation
rcalls for it then the Panthers can also. ’

» , AS MENTIONED BEFORE, the pass defense couldn’t
éadjust to the down and out pass. One way of adjusting
would be to put the best defensive backs out on the field.
’._The two best cornermen that Pitt has /are Eric Crabtree
and Bobby Dyer. Agreed these men can’t play sixty 1nin-
futes of football, but they can be put in when the situation
‘calls for it. ’

_ To understate, John Michelosen has had a problem with
his defensive, unit. They, haven’t progressed as far as they
zgrnight have. If it wasn’t for Josh Novogratz and Jim Flan-
Ihigan making the tackles all over the field the gridder
‘wouldn't have a chance against Podunk U. 1

- As the situation stands now it will be an exciting sea-
on, but excitement and victories don't necessarily correlate
when speaking of the 1965 Panthers.

DURHAM, N. C., OCTOBER 9 — The football team
lost their second game in a row before a national television
- audience at Duke Saturday. The 21-13 loss was the third of
the season for the gridders and their record is now 1-3, while

the Blue Devils continued undefeated with a 4-0 mark.
Coach Bill Murray seemed pleased as he sat talking
with the press after the game. “Scotty Glacken called a con-

sistent game and proved to me
what a ﬁne team leader he is,”
said Murray. ,. W

Head coach Bill Murray was
impressed with Eric Crabtree and
Ken Lucas. “What makes Crab-
tree a great player,” said Murray,
“is that he has the willingness
to ,pull away and is willing to
ﬁght. for that extra yard.”

He praised Lucas but also noted
a weakness in his play. “Lucas is
a. calm, cool and poised quarter-
back and is accurate with his
passes. If he has a weakness it is
that he isn't quick enough to
scramble.”

Although Lucas wasn’t quick
enough to scramble, he had Eric
Crabtree who was quick enough
to lead the Panthers to their ﬁrst
touchdown. They marched 95
yards on the opening kick-oﬁ and
it looked like the gridders re-
membered their offensive formu-
las from the week before. -.

“The odds were about 50-1 that

a team will score from their own _

ﬁve yard line,” said Murray. In
fact since 1957, it has only hap-
pened against us twice and one
of them was today.”

Crabtree was the big threat as

Outshoot Kent, 24-7  

Booters Stop Kent State

For Second
/ _ ‘_
By GEORGE LIES
Kent State ‘tried, but no-
thing -could stop the soccer
team’s combination _of run-
ning and hustling which
gave coach Leo
booters their second win,
3-1, at Forbes Field last Satur-.
day. i
In the ﬁrst quarter .after the de-
fensive fullbacks realized Forbes
Field was 25 yards shorter than
Kennard Field, Cal Bonawitz
kicked a penalty shot with .20 sec-
onds remaining, and put the soc-
cermen ahead, 1-0. And until the
closing minutes of the ﬁnal per-
iod, the booters and goalie Lou
Cepanec had .a shutout as they

_contained Kent State’s offense

and showered their defense with
24 shots. Kent took seven shots.

Throughtout the ﬁrst half, the
soccer team penetrated Kent’s de-
fense, but not enough to score
as attack after attack failed.
Many times the booters’ shots
were on a direct line with Kent’s
goal, but these shots traveled
high over the goal.

After trapping an opponent’s
head ball, Ferd Sauer did this,
kicking the ball over the goal,
and into the scoreboard. Another
time towards the end of the half,
George Somrhers booted one over
the goal, hitting .the‘ baseball
park’s right ﬁeld screen. . ,

When the soccer team didn’

’ go down the middle of the ﬁeld,
they went to, the sides. R.ight\
wingers Bob Racunas and Sal
Tavares both had scoring chances
deep in Kent territory, but nei-
ther scored.

“In the ﬁrst half, we had too
much halfback dribbling, but then

, we used the sidelines. We caught

Kent napping when they had too

many men in the center of the .i

ﬁeld and no one guarding our
wings.” Bemis said. ‘

er ﬁeld hurt the defense because
Kent’s halfbacks kicked high
shots over the defensive men’s
heads which allowed their for-
wards to fast break. “Because our
play contained Kent’s team, our
fullbacks stationed themselves
rights at midﬁeld. When Kent
kicked those high shots, the de-
"fense had to hustle back to the
goal,” said Bemis.

In the second half, the soccer
‘ team opened a wide lead. First it
was D.ave Shaﬁer who scored. A
scramble forthe ball with three
Kent-fullbacks in front of the

tween two of them and to the
right of the surprised‘ goalie. Dom
Milillo received credit for an
assist.

talotta from mid-ﬁeld passed
down the sideline to the unguard-
ed Travares. ,Tavares shot, but
goalie Alex Iswarienko blocked it

fall easy prey to Sauer.

. Kent State’s goal came. on a
disputed penalty shot with Jim
Spasic handling the honors. ‘One
of the booters touched the ball
with his hand. Automatically the
opposition gets a free kick, but
the referee said that the ball was
touched within the _ 18-yard area
of the goal which gave ‘Kent the
penalty .shot., The soccermen ar-
gued the ball was touched out-
side the goal line. This direct
kiclr would allow the booters to

The second touchdown was

The strategy for winning a cross-coun-
try meet is to bunch up the squad and have
them finish as close together as possible.
The Panther runners did just that Satur-
day against Navy, but they bunched up too
far back in the pack. .

As a result, Navy was able to defeatthem,
19-42. The Middies sweptv all of the ﬁrst seven

places with the exception of second, which was

captured by Dave Eichenlaub.

Eichenlaub led the ﬁeld through three of the_
four miles on the course. But Ned.Lawler,pWho

won the event for Navy, passed him at the three-

mile mark and sprinted to an easy victory.

“We didn’t run our race,” was coach Carl Rees’

comment. “Our strategy was for Eichenlaub and

" Hinchberger to lead at the two mile mark, but

I-linchberger, along with a couple of others tight-
ened up at the mile mark and dropped too far
back.”

Hinchberger ﬁnished a disappointing ninth be-
hind Frank Handelman, who ran his best race of

the season.
