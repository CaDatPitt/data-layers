Moderate Upswing In Industrial
Volume ‘For 1935 Predicted
By Students, Faculty

Following a course pursued by
a rep1'ese-nt.at.ive of The Pitt News
in interviewing prominent indus-

trialists in regard to business con-

ditions in_1935, a News reporter
sought" and sometimes found the
attitude of faculty m_embers and

_University students on this subject.

According to Dr. John M. Ferguson,
assistant professor of ~ economics,
there will probably be a moderate up-
swing in the volume of business in
1935_ Dr_ ‘Ferguson stated that this

.prediction, was subject‘ to the con-

tinued mastery of the President over
Congress, a.nd that the political tac-
overwhelming im-
portance that reasoning men would
refrain from prophecy. —

Leonard Mark.s,'C35, has this -to say
on the subject: “Economists have
predicted that 1935 will be a period
of readju_stme.nt when wages and
costs of material goods will conform
more nearly to price index. Under
these‘ conditions it is inevitable that
a normal state of affairs will result.”

Other faculty members and stu-
dents could not be pinned down in re-

.gard to this matter and their remarks

were both evasive and facetious.
For instance, Dr. James G. Charles-

'w'or'th, assistant-_ professor of political
_science, said: -

“Elbert Gary is dead, and Charlie
Schwab has taken his place. I am

"not Charlie Schwab. There is no pre-

diction, as anyone who makes a
prophecy leads with his chin.”
Char1esfForeman, C35, editor of the
Owl, decided that there would be as
many conditions in 1935 as there were

' the past year.

Donald Campbell, C35, another
prognosticator, declared: “PI‘0SD€0IS
are getting better, and I have a con-
ple now myself. Things are looking
up and there are more jobs and more
dough.” ' - ,

Al Dixon, C35, business manager
of the Panther, declared that the
"Panther is far ahead of last year.
“The advertisements are better and
we ‘are getting more of them,” he
said. '

Bob Willison, BA35, remarked:
‘There will be a general trend up-
ward in 1935.
that for the man who sells ca-sh reg-
isters there will be a 30 per cent in-
crea.se ove-r 1934.”

Another soothsayer, Russ Connolly,
C35, declared: “I have ‘allhope for
the future. I come from a line of Re-
publicans that go back a long way. I
am the first Democrat in the family,
and I attribute everything to Wash-
ington. Particularly department stores
are picking up. Why I had’ a chance
to work in a department store my-
self over the vacationlbut I turned it
down. Also the fur business is ’Wa}’
aheavl of where it was at this time
last year.”

The last of the predicters was
George Strong, C36. He stated: “We
are in a period of revolution and up-

— heaval. I think~1935 wiil be the Karl

Marx year of economic history.”

The state of Pennsylvania at the
end of the present biennium, May 31,
-1935, will face a total deﬁcit of $36,-
200,000, according to the ﬁrst report
of the state tax and ﬁnance commis-
sion released Saturday. , " .

Dr. Marion K. McKay, professor of
economics and a member of the com-
mittee, reported that “unless emer-
gency measures can be quickly pro-
vided by the legislature, this is the
situation confronting the state.”

The total deﬁcit includes a cash
-shortage of $21,200,000 and :1. $5,000,-
000 appropriation for relief purposes,
which must be set aside by the legis-
lature, _ ,‘  ’

“Under the circumstances the ad-
ministration will ﬁnd it difficult, if
not impossible, to meet the current
payroll and other necessary state ex-
penditures,” says Dr. McKay.

Dr. \Villian1 T. Root, head of the
department of psychology, also had
a few words of warning to deliver on
the dangers of regarding an I_ Q. too
seriously. “Contrary to common be-
lief," said Dr. Root. “I. Q.’s do not
always remain constant. The I. Q.
that some of these freak children
have may be the result of some spe-
cial,_training which puts them very
much above other children of their
age, but which would not necessa»;r-
ily indicate that those children will
be above normal five or six years
later. Moreover, not all l.‘Q.’s ate
based on the same test. One niuht

renieniber primarily that an I. Q. is;

only an approximate estimate of .a
child’s intelligence based -only on his
his achievement in a particular test
that has been set up.” 2
The psychology department ale
claims that there is no mystery at alll
connected with an I. Q.. that if airy-
thing it will benefit a person to know
exactly what his limitations and ab}-
ities are,’ so that there is no reason
for not telling a person ju‘s_t'_what
grade he has made on an intelligence
test. The department members are
willing to tell individual students
what their rating is on the examina
tion given to all entering freshmen by
the psychology department. '

Traces Tradition
Of World Unity

Social, Not Individual, Rebirth
Called .Essen_tial Theory
Of Jewish Prophets

By James Donoghuc

Speaking before a luncheon audi-
ence Friday in the jointly—sponsored
YM-VVHA and YM-\VCA_ noon forum
series, J, Middleton Murry, English
author and lecturer, stressed the es-
sential continuity of Jesus, Spinoza
and Marx.

‘Through the three Jewish prophets
of the modern world,” Mr. Murry said,
“the Jewish tradition has persisted and
is of signiﬁcance to us today. The
Jews are people who discovered mou-
otheism, and with them it reached
the state of an ecstatic apprehension
of the universe.”

According to Mr. Murry, with the
rise of Jesus there came an under-
standing of “a new ethical relation"
from which grew “universal toler-
ance,” exempliﬁed in the doctrine of
“love your neighbor.” “The teachings
of Jesus are far beyond us today as
they were when they were first-up
tered.” he declared.

Jesus “Sought Death”

The author of “The Necessity of

,Communism” believes, however, that .
iwhen Jesus’ doctrines were rejected

because they were “a challenge to the
letter of the law.” he deliberately
sought death in Jerusalem as'a sym-
bolic sacriﬁce that he might by his
death, introduce a new world by a ﬁat
of his will, “Through his death Chris-
tianity succeeded to the turbulent
heritage of the Jews." ‘

“Benedict Spinoza appeared after
Christianity had begun to put more
emphasis on the purely unessential
things. However, for me to give a
complete picture of Spinoza in ten
minutes after lunch, is too much,”
the speaker confessed.

In connection with Spinoza, Mr.
Murry pointed out that Spinoza in-
sisted that man was not a free agent
but “is subject to the laws of Nature
and is not ‘imperium imperio.”’ Ac-
cording to Spinoza he must arrive at
“;self-consciousness” as an ethical
dutsv ._   - . .

“Spinoza was. a. r-estater.n‘éint' of
Jesus," he asserted, “and both insist-
ed on a loss of individuality.”

Marx Continues Heritage

Karl Marx, according to Mr_ Murry,
must also be considered as a contin-
uation of Spinoza and Jesus. “Marx
is compatible with, and is the evolu-
tion of. Jesus and Spinoza,” he
stated, “in that he insists on social re-
generation and not individual regen-
eration." _ .

The signiﬁcance of these three
prophets today. Mr. Murry declared,
lies in the fact that “at the present
time world unity exists, and that
unity has become an economic real-
ity."

The English author statedpthat he
believes the world will become uni-
fied politically and socially and that
such uniﬁcation is inevitable.

“However,” he concluded, “it took
the genius of these three Jewish
prophets to foresee this.”

IT VVAS VVILL-O-THE-WVISP LIGHT that the

local -‘ representative of the -Scr_ipps-Howard- ,

newspapers gave Thursday, and if the People Find
Their Own _VVay, it, will not be from reading the
article, “Pitt Liberals Seek Charter.” ‘H P

The story reviewed student attempts last year
to obtain a permanent charter for a campus cl1ap-
ter of the League for Social Just.icc—nat.ional so-

ciety which iiivestigates social questions and which

has helped to obtain remedial social legis_lat.ion in
Pennsylvania and other states. The story inferred
a reactionary character to the denial of the char-

tcrby a committee of the now dead-and-buri-ed

Student Council.

So far, so good. Speaking of the renewal of the
petition for a charter this year, however, the story
declares:

“However, the assembly"s small, but power-
ful Executive Committee, on which sit the in-
ﬂuential Dean of Men and Dean of \Vomen, in
a meeting lastmonth denied the right. of the
Organizations Committee to go before the big
legislative body for a ﬁnal decision on any
question. ’ ’

No more. No mentionof the fact that the Uni-
versity Assembly, “t.h'e big legislative‘body,”sub-
sequently upheld nearly unanimously the right of
the Executive cominittee to have its subcommittees
report to itself. Or no mention of the fact that
“the big legislative body” so voted only because
of a. clause in the constitution of the Student Fac-

ulty Association, which guarantees any member of

“the big legislative body” the right. to submit any
question whatsoever to that body, and which as-
sures to that body the essence of legislature in the
duty to ratify or reverse the acts of the “small,
but powerful Executive committee.”

The charge that “the Executive comniittcc is in
a position to bury requests and recommendations,
without anybody ever ﬁnding out what. happens,
in the manner of the pickling coniniittecs in the
Legislature,” is moreover pretty unimpressive.
Without following further the intriguing line of
.t-.h__0i1gl_1t about the Legislature, it is hard to see how

-a. question like, for instance, the League for Social

Justice charter petition, could be buried, “with-
out anybody ever ﬁnding out” what happened, or
without the question being disinterrcd before the
whole Assembly. Even if the Executive committee
yearned to be a star cl1amber——which it shows no
sign of yearning for-—t.he committee is neither
small enough nor skillful enough to carry it off.
The University Assembly is doubtless not the
best-of-all-possiblegovernments in the-best-of-all-
possible-worlds. But it shows no sign of delegat-
ing its responsibility by an iota. If the student
ineinbcrs of the League for Social Justice receive
their charter, it will be from the hands and by the
responsibility of the whole Assembly. The whole

Assembly will similarly be responsible if the char-
ter petition 1S allowed to fail.
* * ¥l=

 PE'l‘l'l‘lON for a charter should be granted,

and it should be granted as soon as possible.

It 1S'dlfﬁCl1lt., _indeed, to imagine what social,
economic or political questions university students
should not be given every encouragement to ex-
amine. A chapter of the League for Social Justice
on the campus would give students of the Univer-
sity the advantage of League research and the ex-
pcriencc of League speakers and investigators. It
would help to unite students here with a whole

United Statesfull of students facing similar eco-

nomic terms; unemploymcnt and blocked oppor-
tunity for trained, keenly ambitious youth.

The League should be_cl1a1'te1'ed ‘because of the
need for expert and critical analysis of the world
into which we, as students, are about to jump or
be thrust. _

It should be chartered because of the need for
free discussion in a university which seeks to ed-
ucatc a_ free people.

The League should be chartered because it has
an excellent reputation for unselﬁsh, social inter-
cstedness.

The Executive committee should favorablv re-
port the matter to the Assembly tomorrow night,
and the Assembly should ratify speedily. The As-
sembly would do well to become charter members.

The

True Artist Wiiii
Eury Ego In

Drama

 

By Edwin P. Banks

HERE ARE TVVO types of famous actors: the ﬁrst
is always himself no matter what role he plays; the
second is a different; individual in every new part.

Garbo, John Barrymore, Arliss and Cornell belong to
the first group. Each must always reveal his person-
ality. Garbo is inevitably Garbo (as the worshipping
critics proclaim) whether she is Queen Christina. or
Anna Christie. Arliss is Arliss whether he is Disraeli,
the Jew of Venice, or an old English gentleman. It is
forever the “I” which this type-is bringing to the audi-
ence; and because that “I” is charming or mysterious or
exceedingly clever, the public applauds it.

0 THE OTHER class belong Muni, Hayes and Hus-

ton. These actors are their characters. They may
possess just as strong a consciousness or their ego, but
they -submerge it in their creation of the moment. Muni
is Scarface when he plays Scarface, and he is- the Fug-
itive when he plays the Fugitive.

It would be silly, of course, to uphold one style of
-ac-ting to the exclusion of the other. We enjoyboth.
But the “I” actors are being praised out of proportion
to their histrionic ability. ‘Let the critics prostrate them-
selves before Garbo all they care to; but although they
are bewitched by their strange glamour, do not let them
translate that glamour as acting perfection. Do not let
them call Cornell a great actress simply because she has
an ineﬁably lovely manner of folding her hands.

as an actor, forget his technical polish, and make us
live only with the individual he is portraying. After his

performance is- over, we will remember his skill, per-,

ha.ps, but not until afterwards. If we see his character-
ization and not him above his characteri-zation—~then he
is a great actor. = ~

However, I still- like -Garbo, and-= Mae West is so de-
lightfully American.

To Lie Or Not To Lie Is
Asked By Psychology Test

By Robert Raven
AVE YOU EVER changed an answer on a test paper
after having seen som.eone’s else paper?

Have you attempted to use slugs to operate a slot
machine? ‘ ‘

Such were the questions that suddenly jarred the coni-
placent, lackadaisical student: out of his habitual, irre-
sponsible world. Out of a clear sky he was accusingly
confronted by the halliicinatory ﬁnger of his conscience,
roaring, “DID YOU or DID YOU NO'l‘, answer me truth-
fully?”

The students of the psychology classes were exposed
to a. barrage of a hundred and thirty such questions in a
questionnaire which they were requested to answer by
the psychology department. The questionnaire was made
out by Mrs. Rhinehart, assistant to Dr. Root, the head of
the Psychology department, for the purpose of making
comparisons of honesty between various occupational,
religious and age groups. Names were not required to
be signed since only the group responses were wanted
and not individual responses.

To give a true picture of the agony that these vic-
tims endured, a list of some of the questions follow.
Most of these questions were answered “frequently" and
“always or at every chance.”

Have you failed to return a borrowed umbrella?

Have you misrepresented your experience when ap-
plying for a job?

Have you voted more than once at a single election?

Have you silver, towels, or any other souvenirs from
hotels, restaurants, trains, etc.? A '

Have you turned your speedometer or tampered with
it in order that the entire mileage would not be re-
corded? (To sell it).

Have you “just loafed” on your employer's time?

Have you taken a newspaper or a bottle of milk from
the door step of some one else?

Have you used a. set of signals to communicate with
your partner in a card game?

Have you listened in on the telephone conversations
when you have had the opportunity?

Have you tried to avoid paying your fare?

Do you “sponge" when you get the opportunity?

Have you attempted to make a telephone call at a
pay station without paying for the call?

Have you consciously violated parking rules?

“Many acts of dishonesty,” however, reassures Mrs.
Rhinehart, “are performed at some time or other by
the ‘best’ people. Normal people are not strictly honest."

new movement. Many went to such
extremes as to make their works

writings of E, E. Cummings, Gertrude

so incomprehensible as not even to

two American writers who were free

_.the first of the American writers sans-
ciilottes.

Cynic Mencken And Clan

 But the rapid, post-bellum changes
in 'our economic and social structure
effected another revolt in our literary
history. Cynicism in its extreme form
made its appearance in the 1920’:-'. Its
protagonist. was and still is H. L.
Mencken and his retinue—if there are
any left. The inﬂuence he exer-ted
over the literati of America. was al-
most unprecedented. His philosophy
qontainecl no embodiment of social re-
form. Mockery for mockery’s sake
was their motto_

1 Therein lay the great fallacy of Mr.
_Mencken’s tlioughtz He could have
been, had he a triﬂe more keenness,
the apostle of the new proletarianism
—-the movement ’which is steadilv
gaining strength with contempora.1'yit
luminati. But his cynicism could no
more endure than could “art for art's
sake.” Cynicism can only prevail in
a’ time of transition when all our aims
and values are in a state of chaos.
Old values are too ‘r.-aiikrupt to in-
spire; new ones are too-iinfornied to
challenge or compel. However, as

's_§)on as the old‘ values are proved

wanting and then forsaken, and the
ncw values have managed to crystal-
is succeeded by aim

gun. "
Thus, today, when cynicism is
‘No.-longer rampant and Mencken
_is intellectually dead, American.
_literature finds itself in the begin-
ning of a new era. The three out-
standing movements of our decade

are (1) the new regionalism, (2)

.the new humanism, and (3). the

new proletarianism. Thenew re-

“gionalists would have us turn
back to the land for our inspiration,
realizing, hence, it the -great" ad-
vantage of an agrarian over an in-
dustrialized civilization. '

This movement, incidentally, is akin
tothe program of Mahatma Gandhi, in
that they both embody a-back-to—the-
la'nd-movement in order to avert the
exploitation of imperialistic countries,
This new regionalism is reactionary.
Revert; To Classics

The new humanism, the leaders of
which are More and Babbit, would
ever, the only movement. which
of American life is the new proletar-
ianisni. It alone refiises to turn back!
either to classical antiquity or to the
soil for its tradition. It is seeking——~
and at present with remarkable suc-
cess—~to create a new literature out
of the vast resources of the proletariat.
It is the movement which deals with
immediate change. It is not afraid of
reality. Margaret Anderson in “My
Thirty Years’ War" expresses the
sentiments of those who are afraid of
the truth. “My greatest foe has been
reality. I have been ﬁghting it suc-
cessfully for 30* Years.”

Thornton Wilder in “The XVoman
of Andros” and other writers like him
continue to dodge the truth. Instead
of dealing with the struggle between
capital and labor, with the masses,
with urban life, with tangible sub-
jects like coal workers, factory labor-
ers. racketeers, Wilder seeks escape to
Rome, Greece or Peru.

The salient concern of the pro-
lctarian writer is to reveal to the
worker the historic destiny of its
class. The revolutionary writer and
critic, while they do not relegate
craf'ma.nsliip in writing to a minor
position, realize that art is no longer
a thing apart. Art must serve man-
and not man, art.

\Vith the death of individualism,
and with the impotence of the two
reactionary movements. new human-
ism, and the new regionalism, it is
inevitable that American literatiire

May I humbly suggest that The Pitt

Panthers Shaded Again

By Duke_s__l_n Thriller

Miss Scoring Chances In Final Moments After

Strong Second -

Half Comeback

By Charles A. ﬁnch

VVhat.ever gods there be who hover over the

dium basketball

sta

pavilion when Pitt battles Duquesne, they are still a little sour to-
ward. Pitt. Friday night the Panthers put on a. sensational spurt late
in the second half to come from a position of eight points to the rear

of the Dukes up to a spot just one

point ahead. But at the last min-

ute those rul.ers of the basketball destinies changed their minds again
and turned in a verdict in favor of Duquesne. The count was 27
Q

After Vvalt Miller had made him-
self a place in the hearts of all Duke

supporters by slipping in a foul shot

togive the men from the Bluff a. one-
point advantage with only a couple of
minutes to go, both Noon and Cribbs

‘missed out on tosses from the foul

line and Roderick stole the ball from
to
watch his carefully aimed shot spin
right oﬁ of the rim. Birch added an-
other free throw for Duquesne with
only seconds more to play and the
Panther had but one more scoring
chance.

It found Wainio toeing the foul-
line for a single penalty shot just as
the time clock showed 14 seconds re-
maining in the game. The slim one
arranged to miss the shot purposely
so that his tall teammates, Pete Noon
and Claire Cribbs, might grab the
ball from the backboard and bump in

the necessary two points. The Dukes.-
fhowever, had ~diff_ierent.
gathered in sufficient numbers toipre-‘

ideas and
vent such a coup and the timer’s gun
ended it all then and there.

The game had everything. There
was good basketball and there was
bad basketball. ,There ‘W.'3I‘.e thrilling:
long shots made and heartbreaking
short shots-missed. There were colli-
sions galore, one of which sent
Messrs. Wainio and Serany crashing
into the boards behind one basket
with all the aplomb of a couple of
kids diving into a hayloft.

Coaches Have Fun _

There was Duquesne’s coach, Chick
Davies, stomping up to the scorers‘
‘table and pounding said table with a
pound vigorous enough to keep its
legs wobbling yet, while he announced
to one and all that “there is not
three fouls on Kweller.” There was
smiling Doctor Carlson blithely ask-
ing Referee ‘I-Ietra “why do you sup-
-pose we give these scorekeepers
pencils?” after Hetra ha.d altered
Kweller’s status on the books.

It all began like a pretty tame eve-
ning of basketball. Emrick started
the scoring for Pitt with a ﬁeld goal
and Roderick added a foul. \Vithout
:1 word of warning Serany popped 111
two fouls for the Dukes and little
Paul Murphy put all of his 115 pounds
behind one to send it right through
the hoop from far out. Here the Pan-
thers took time out to get their bear-
ings, but they failed to locate them
for the remainder of the first half,
which ended at a score of 14-10.

Field goals by Noon and Cribbs
early after the intermission were of?-
set by similar efforts by Miller and
Serany. Then Murphy did some more
damage to the Pitt cause by throwing
in another long one. Two fouls by
Serany and one by Kweller brought
Pitt its darkest hour, with the score-
board reading 22-14 for the Dukes.

Then the Pitt quintet roared into
action as if someone had just remem-
bered to turn on the ignition and the
Panthers had the Dukes backed into
:1 corner and ﬁnding themselves one
point behind after the sudden turn of
affairs. Every man on the Pitt start-
ing ﬁve contributed to this outburst,
with Cribbs sending in the basket
which put happiness in Pitt-hearts
for the ﬁrst time since the outset of
the game.

Prosperity Soon Departs

The celebration was as short as it
was sweet, however, as Myers. sub-
bing for the ﬁnally banished Kweller,
made good on a foul shot. What Mr.
Miller and Mr. Birch-. did then‘ with
their fouls was all that it took to
make up the docket.

It just didn’t seem to be in the
cards for the Panthers to win the ball
game. The ball handling during the
first half and for a part of the second
half was not at all like that of a Pitt
team in top form, while the Panther
shots seemed to be hitting every part
of the rimbut the inside.

The fact remains that the Dukes
heat the Panthers in equal combat,
with all hands on deck and all guns
booming. ._ There is no getting away
from the point that the Duquesne ﬁve"
of Birch, Miller, Kweller, Serany, and
the tiny Murphy played their heads
off to win that ball game. It is all
that can be said before another day
of reckoning comes up on February 8
when the two outﬁts clash again.

Swimming Team
Heads Eastward
For Two Meets

Franklin And Marshall, Delaware
Scheduled For Panthers
On Successsive Days‘

This week-end Coach Pat Corr’s
varsity swimming team will travel
eastward to meet two of the East's
strongest tank squads. The Pan-
thers will meet the Franklin and Mar-
shall team on Friday night in the
Lancaster pool, and on Saturday night
the University of Delaware swimmers
will be the opponents of the Pan-
thers -at: Newark, Delaware.

Both universities aremembers of
the Eastern Intercollegiate I-Swimming
association. By winning these two
matches and downing Tech later in
the season the Pitt team stands a ﬁne
chance to tie if not to win ﬁrstplace
in the conference standings. For the
past ﬁve seasons the Panthers have
either won or tied for the champion-
ship in this league.‘ ' A

Coach Corr is hoping that the re-
sults will be the same as last winter,
when the-Pitt team defeated both op-
ponents quite handily, This-, Con-
believes, will be much more difficult
inasmuch as he lost four of his high
point-scorers through graduation. To
make it tougher still, the freshman
swimmers moving up to the vaslty
havenot come up to expectations.

In the breaststroke event the team

:as hit hard by the loss of Herman
Adlersberg and Joseph Schmeiler.
This season Corr will have to rely
on two men accustomed to swimming
backstroke to handle the breast-
stroke event. These are John Stir-
anka, a sophomore and former city
interscholastic backstroke champion,
and Vvilliam Swazuk, a junior, with
one year of va.rsit_v experience.

Harry Geyer and George Meyer
will perform in the diving event,
which job-was so capably .handled
by John Carik for the past three
years. Carik ﬁnished three years of
Va-1‘Sii-Y competition, taking ﬁrst
place in every dual meet but one.

Other entrants include" Russ Lind-
berg in the 440 and backstroke
events, Captain Jack. Denny in the
220, Paul Stinner in the 50.'and VVil-
liam Ruhe and Harry Geyer in the
100-yard freestyle event.

All members of the varsity and
freshman swimming teams are re-
quested to report to Trees Gymnasium
tomorrow at 5 o’clock for a group
picture. It is important that all
swimmers report promptly.

The Carlso-nmen defeated the veteran

Pitt ’s‘ All-East Gridmen

Expected Back Tomorrow

After spending perhaps the ﬁnest
Christmas vacation of any students in
the University, Pitt’s three represen-
tatives on the All-East, football team
are expected to arrive in Pittsburgh
tomorrow. .

Miller Munjas, Izzy Weinstock, and
Doc Hartwig are the three, each of
whom starred in the New Year's Day
game when the West defeated the
East in a charity grid affair in sunny
California.

Munjas was captain and quarter-
back for the East, whi-le Weinstock
and I-Iartwig played a good portion of
the game at fullback and guard, re-
spectively.

Planning Dance

Executive committees of all four
University women’s classes will
meet today at 12:30 o’clock in

bility of having an all-University
women’s dance the ﬁrst weekend
of next semester.

If the plans are approved by the
committee and the dance is sched-
uled, there will probably be an-
other dance next fall. Since the
women’s classes are the only or-
ganizations on campus not subsi-
dized by the University, these
dances will bring enough money
into the treasury to pay the expen-
ses of the year.

Thus the dance next fall would
put. enough money into the four
treasuries to provide for 1935-1936
expenses according to Frances
McLaughlin, C35, president of the
senior class. Miss lVlcLaughlin
called the meeting today.
