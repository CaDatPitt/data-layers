New program focus of three
year weight control study

By Rich Cholodofsky

For The Pitt News

Development of a new, more
effective behavioral weight con-
trol program for adults with Type
II diabetes is the focus of a 3-year,
$950,000 study at the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine. ‘

The study, funded by the Na-
tional lnstitutes of Health, is
needed to help understand the

best ways fo_r patients to safely.

lose weight by changes in their
exercise program and eating
habits.

Changes in the patient’s eating

S habits in this study are accom-

plished by a very low-calorie diet.

Project coordinator Elaine Blair
described the diet of 400-500
calories of very lean meat, fish or
fowl, as being safe.

”The diet itself is very safe.
There are also two project physi-
cians on duty as well,” said Blair.

Blair explained the study as
”Asking whether our standard
program of a 1,200 calorie, free-
choice diet‘ with exercise, used
alone, or in combination with the

very low-calorie diet will work.

better.”

“The low calorie diet will help
people lose more weight immedi-

ately, but what we want to find ’

out is whether it is more effective
in the longjrun,” she said.

 

The treatment for people with

'-Type ll diabetes is weight loss,

which will improve blood sugar
and decrease the risk of heart
disease.

Type II diabetes, or adult onset
diabetes, ails 60 to 90 percent of
all overweight adults with dia-
betes. These people control the
disease by watching their sugar
intake through careful eating, tak-
ing of oral medicine or injecting
insulin.

The other, more severe type of
diabetes is Type l diabetes, also

called child onset diabetes. It af— .

flicts normal and” “underweight
children. The only way of con-
trolling this is through the injec-

tion of insulin. , W V

Editor in Chief

Pitt basketball player Rod
Brookin, who witnesses placed at
the scene of last Friday night's al-
leged crime in south Oakland in-
volving three Pitt basketball
players, has been the victim of
mistaken identity according to his
girlfriend, Brigitte Williams of
Penn Hills. '

Eyewitnesses of the incident -
which involved Pitt basketball
players Jerome Lane, Demetreus
Gore and Steve Maslek alleged-
ly beating up Joe Prezioso and
Robert Scott, both 20, in their
apartment at 3821 Dawson St.

— Brigitte Williams
in Monday's edition of The Pitt

News Scott and another victim,
Chris Gariti, both said they saw

Brookin at the scene of the‘al— '

leged crime. _
But on Tuesday Scott and Car-
iti retracted those statements.

Gariti told the Pittsburgh Post--

Cazette, "it all happenned so fast
that I'm not sure who did it.”

Scott said that he doesn't
remember seeing Brookin at the
party or when the alleged assault
took place.

Williams said that she picked
up Brookin at the Lothrop Resi-
dence Hall on Lothrop Street in
Oakland where he resides on Fri-
day night at approximately 7 p.m.

She said Brookin spent the
whole weekend in Penn Hills
and wasn't in the vicinity of the
Oakland area again until the fol-
lowing Monday morning. ‘

”Rod was really upset when he V

Reagan denies he authorizedassassination plan

WASHINGTON —— President
Reagan, denying that he ever
signed any document authorizing
an assassination, said Wednesday
there is ”an awful lot of fiction”
being spread about the late CIA
Director William J. Casey.

”There are a lot of things he is
being charged with right now,
and I don't think any of them
have a basis in fact,” Reagan said
in response to reporters’ ques-

‘tions after a White House
ceremony. .

White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said the presi-
dent telephoned Casey's widow,
Sophia, after Mrs. Casey disput-
ed’ writer Bob Woodward's ac-
count of an interview with her
husband while he was hospital-
ized with his fatal illness. He said
the president ”offered his sup-
port” to Mrs. Casey in the call
Monday night.

Reagan was asked Wednesday
about allegations in a book by
Woodward, assistant managing
editor of The Washington Post,
that Casey arranged for Saudi
Arabian intelligence units to un-

dertake three covert operations
including an assassination at-
tempt aimed at Sheikh Mo-
hammed Hussein Fadlallah,

leader of the Shiite Moslem-fac-I

tion known as the ”Party of God”
in Lebanon.

”Never would I sign anything
that would authorize an assassi-
nation,” he said. ”I never have,
and I never will, and I didn’t.”

 Biden continues to
attack Robert Bork 

WASHINQTON — Joe Biden,
an angry, frustrated man when he
abandoned his presidential can-
didacy a week ago, seems
relaxed and rejuvenated as he

helps lead the battle to block

Senate confirmation of Supreme
Court nominee Robert H. Bork.
- The Democratic senator from
Delaware has been conducting
the ‘Bork hearings this week with

more humor and bite, poking fun
at himself and quizzing witness-
es with new verve.

Biden announced his with-
drawal as a candidate on Sept.
23, after confessing painfully to
plagiarism in law school and
exaggerating his academic record
when confronted by a heckler
during an earlier campaign stop.

 while Reagan still
says Bork is okay 

‘WASHINGTON _ President
Reagan, fighting to keep his

Supreme Court nomination of
Bork alive, urged the Senate

Wednesday to ignore a ”cam-»

paign of disinformation and dis-
tortion” against the conservative
jurist. -

He did not say whom he was
accusing of such a campaign.

Reagan, in a speech to support-
ers at the White House complex,
said his nominee represents the
mainstream of U.S. legal thought,
and he hotly disputed the idea
that Bork is a radical who would
upset the balance of the court.

’’I do not believe the United
States Senate will succumb to al-

lowing the special interests to

-choose Supreme Court mem-

bers,” Reagan said.

The president, in the latest in a
series of speeches designed to
counter recent polls that have
shown the public is turning
against Bork, argued that those
opposed to the nomination had
twisted Bork’s record and misin-
terpreted his writings as a legal
scholar. -

State Department not
happy with Iran ban

WASHINGTON — The State
Department said Wednesday it
shared the Senate's distaste for
Iranian‘ policies but questioned
whether a ban on all imports
would change them.

”We want to be sure whatever
we do is effective in achieving the
objective we share with Con-
gress, which is to bring about a
change in Iranian behavior,”
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
said.

The Senate voted 98-0 Tuesday
in favor of an import ban. A sharp‘
rise in oil imports from, Iran
prompted the move. '

UA W and Ford reach
agreement; GM next

DETROIT — United Auto Wor— ‘

kers members ratified a job-
protecting contract with Ford Mo-
tor Co. by a 72 percent margin,
clearing the way for intensive
negotiations with General Motors
COrp., the union said Wed-
nesday. -

”This strong margin of endorse-
ment confirms that the member-
ship at Ford recognizes that we
achieved our No. 1 goal, which
is greatly enhanced job security,”
UAW President Owen Bieber
and Vice President Stephen
Yokich said in a statement.

Yokich said the agreement will
be signed at 3 p.m. Monday at
Ford headquarters in Dearborn.
The union said it will not release
the vote count.

The 104,000 active UAW auto-
workers at Ford completed voting
on the pact Wednesday morning.
The agreement slows the rate of
attrition by half and greatly
reduces the reasons for which
Ford can lay off workers.

  Programs for black students not

By Frances Sansig
News Editor

Editor’s Note: The following

article is part II in a series of five

articles dealing with racial
prejudice nationally and at the
University of Pittsburgh.

The University of Pittsburgh is
one of 15 state—owned schools
under a court order initiated in
1983 to desegregate the higher
education system by the end of
the 1987-88 school year. (The
order came about in response to
a lawsuit filed in 1970 by the
NAACP.)

In view of the statistics, it is ob-
vious why some saw the need to
institute this mandate. Whether
or not the University of Pittsburgh
and other universities are meet-
ing the goals as specified by the
order remains in question.

For instance, according to the
American Council on ‘Education's
Fifth Annual Status Report 1986,
black undergraduate and gradu-
ate enrollments declined signifi-
cantly betwen 1980 and 1984,
while Hispanic and Asian enroll-
ments increased at both under-
graduate and graduate levels.
Blacks received fewer bachelor's
and master's degrees in 1984
than in 1978, while other minori-
ties advanced at both levels. _

The report concludes, alarm-

« ingly enough, that while minori-

ties are growing in number, they

continue to be underrepresented:

in post-secondary education.
Jack Daniel, associate provost

for undergraduate education at

P_it_t, saysthat first_ly, many people

have misconceptions-‘»about black

students. .
”The most recent recipient of
the Rhodes Scholarship at Pitt
was a black student. Several
black students are Chancellor's
Scholars. Other black students
partake of the honors college's
curriculum offerings. Yet, there
are some teachers who assume
that every black student who
enters their classroom is an

 THE pm N:ws,n..,..aay,s October 1, 1937 .

educationally disadvantaged stu-
dent,” said Daniel.

Daniel said that because most
black students are first-generation
college students, they are not
well enough informed to obtain
the maximum education benefits

from their university.
”Hence, they need a support

system-,” he commented.

It appears that the resource net-
work that currently exists for
black students has been amputat-
ed at the pulse.

”Many faculty members estab-
lish relationships with students
that go beyond the classroom.
They help students prepare in ad-
vance. They, in short, extend the
classroom learning situation,”
said Daniel. ”There is not enough
opportunity for this to happen
with black students.”

According to Daniel, there are
many faculty members who do
not know enough about the
general cultural backgrounds, the
cognitive skill levels and learning
styles of black students, and as a

-result, they often proceed with
, pedagogical styles that are not the

most appropriate for black
students. ‘

Monique Sims, chairperson of
Pitt's Black Action Society, sug-
gests that ignorance about black
culture is cultivated at the
elementary school level.. A

”For hundreds of years, we've
[blacks] been taught about Euro-

. pean culture. We're all human

beings, but our experiences are
so different. I heard some
statistics at a seminar I attended.

Black students who go to a pre- .-1
dominantly white school — the‘ ‘F

dropout rate is 70 percent. There
just aren't enough black mentors,
faculty, etc. On the other hand,

I heard that when black students -

attend a predominantly black

"university, there's a 70 percent

chance they'll graduate.”
According to the ACE report,
college achievement test scores
are one of several factors closely
related to the retention rate of

blacks at universities.
Upon first glance, it seems con-

tradictory to note that the.

Scholastic Aptitude scores of
minorities have made tremen-
dous gains this year. But upon
closer inspection, one finds that
though the black-white SAT
difference has been reduced by
50 points in 11 years, the SAT
scores of black and white stu-
dents are a long way from parity.
This is according to Donald M.
Stewart, the college board
president.

What are programs like Affir-
mative Action doing to alleviate
situations like a disproportionate
amount of white Anglo-Saxon
males in the work force, which
could and does include universi-
ty professors?

”Let’s just say, I think Affirma-
tive Action could be better,” stat-
ed,Sims.

One of the express goals of the .
BAS is to bring staff and faculty-

together with the black student
body. ’’I really think we need
more black faculty and more
black professors at Pitt,” said
Sims.

Associate-Provost Daniel said
there is really no one to blame for
the lack of significant, sufficient
programs for black collegiates:

”Placing blame would still not
solve the problem. There's a great
need to have more black students
in the natural sciences, health
and applied sciences, but without

additional support, such as work?

Staff Writer _

”We always have people in
here,” according to Roberta Shef-
fler, cashier at the 7—EIeven near
the Towers. ”When I say we're
busy until [2 a.m.], that means
that. you have a line of people, a
steady line of people.”

It seems that Pitt students take
full advantage of the stores on
campus that are open 24 hours a
day, seven days a week. Whether
the store is Sheetz, on the corner
of Oakland and Forbes; Co-Go's,
on the corner of Meyran and
Forbes; or 7—EIeven, across from
David Lawrence Hall, people can
be found inside at almost any
time, buying anything from
coffee to Coke to cookies.

”It’s like, right now, in between
studying, [7-Eleven] is close
enough that it won't take that
much time,” said Mike Zone, a
freshman living in the Towers. ”I

run down here and get back up,

to my room, to start studying
again.”

Because of the around-the-
clock business, these stores ex-
perience all kinds of different,cus-

tomers. During different times

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October I, I987

throughout the day, business
changes. Early in the evening,
around 8 p.m. to II p.m., busi-
ness is brisk, and a fairly broad
variety of items are bought, most-
Iy food.

”When I lived at home I didn't
have dinner until 7:30 p.m.,” said
freshman Eric Weber, who
bought bread, peanut butter, jel-
ly and Fritos. ”Now I eat at 5 p.m.
to 5:38 p.m., and later I get
hungry.”

Often, late at night, the crowd
is mainly comprised of people
who have just left the nearby
bars. The items they buy are
usually simple and fairly minor.
”Cigarettes, drinks and mun-
chies,” according to Co—Go’s em-
ployee ’Ken Polit, who will be
attending Pitt in the fall. Sheffler
said she agrees. -”When the bars
close at two in the morning, peo-
ple come here wanting chewing
gum, change or cigarettes.”

After two or three in the morn-
ing business tends tosubside, but
only for a few hours-. Early birds
begin showing up around 5 a.m.
for coffee and, snacks. Not many
Pitt students are around at this
time, but cab drivers and police-
men often grab something to eat

ores convenient for students

at these stores before going to
work on the streets.

These stores may be open all
night, but not without a price. An
II—ounce bag of Doritos costs

$2.06 at Giant Eagle and costs‘

almost a quarter more at
7—Eleven. Two liters of Pepsican
cost up to twice as much at a
24-hour store than at Giant Eagle.
But the close‘ proximity and late
hours seem to make these stores
more attractive to students.
”We cater mostly to kids. I
mean, we don't sell pet food, and
we don't sell baby products,”
said Sheffler. This is evident by
the fact that most items come in

one size —- usually the smallest —

one. A big exception is the chip
and cheese doodle section,
which takes up a whole aisle in
each of three stores. An obvious
favorite-sale item, they come in
all sizes and varieties.

The fact that these stores de-
pend mostly on student business
and are fairly small in size com-
pared to Giant Eagle may be the
reason why students like to go to
them. It may be why they also
shop there in the daytime as well
as the night.

will undergo multiple bypass surgery
Thursday to correct blockages in all three

arteries to his heart, doctors said after con—_

firming he had a mild attack sometime
within the last month.
Dr. William F. Pierce, who will be in

Dr. David Leaman, chief of cardiolog

‘at the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center,
said the governor has an excellent chance
of a‘ full recovery.

‘Casey, whotook office in January, will
remain in control of the state throughout

the surgery, which will take four to five

hours, said his chief of staff, William
Keisling.

”Except for the duration of the surgical
procedure A and the immediate post-
operative period, the governor will not be
incapacitated or disabled,” Leaman said.

He said Casey should be able to work
full time in six weeks, but Keisling said
the governor plans to do some work next
week. Pierce said the governor was in
good condition, and the operation should
be routine.

“By Monday, he will be asking the A

Senate Republicans to get on with the

state's business,” Keisling said.

Casey was admitted to the Medical
Center on Tuesday after Leaman noticed
an abnormality on an electrocardiogram.

Leaman said the attack occurred after

Aug. 31, when Casey underwent a rou- .

that time showed a minor abnormality —
but not one symptomatic of a heart attack,

_ ludge acquitted of assault
charges stemming from '86

PHILADELPHIA — A Philadelphia elec-

tion judge has been acquitted of charges‘

that he assaulted a woman -during the
May 1986 primary election and broke
election laws. ' ‘
Muncipal Judge Michael J. Conroy ac-
quitted Bernard Fisgaer, 62, Tuesday.-He
had been charged with indecent assault
and violations of the state's election code.

Court documents said he was accused -

of sexually harassing and grabbing the
breast of Marilyn Kossef, a candidate run-
ning against his wife for Democratic com-
mitteewoman.

Fisgaer was also charged with illegally

' Scientists say effects of

acid rain are overestimated

PITTSBURGH — Faulty,“50-year—old_
studies have led many scientists to over-
estimate the effects of acid rain, research-
ers told coal industry representatives
Wednesday.

”What’s emerging here is the evolution
of science,” said Edward C. Krug of the
Illinois State Water Survey. ”Our early
thinking was simplistic.”

Krug was one of more than 500 indus-

' try, government and university officials at-

tending the fourth annual Pittsburgh Coal

-Conference. The conference began Tues-

day and ends Friday. _ V

His studies of 19 lakes in the Northeast
in the 1980s was featured in a recently
released government report that claimed
acid rain poses no immediate threat to the
environment.

But environmentalists claim the study
was political propaganda and a distortion

, of the scientific reports on which it was

based. They are pushing for new controls
on the motor vehicle, power plant and

undergo heart surgery

factory pollutants that cause acid rain.-

The Reagan administration has resisted
additional controls on the grounds that
not enough is known about the causes
and effects of acid rain to justify the enor-

. mous costs.
Krug said in the past, scientists failed to —

consider the natural acidity of some
waters, leading them to believe they were
more acidic than they actually were.

Committee says consumers
getting ripped off bigtime

HARRISBURG —- Consumers are prob-
ably being ripped off because many
scales at places like grocery stores and gas
pumps aren't adequately checked for ac-
curacy, members of a legislative watch-

dog committee said Wednesday. :

Lawmakers on the Legislative Budget
and Finance Committee said more

needed throughout Pennsylvania, and
there mustjbe acoordinated effort with
county officials to remedy the problems.

”Weights and measures enforcement is
continuing to be a problem in Pennsyl-

Exec can’tget enoug steel tomeet demands

By Earl Bohn

Associated Press Writer

Job cuts, plant closings,
productivity improvements and
import controls have meant the
return‘ of profits for American
steel producers after long and

devastating financial losses.

The -industry’s turnaround has
meant something else to Russ
Weidner.

”Right now we can't buy for
love nor money a pound of steel
for delivery in 1987,” said the ex-
ecutive vice president of Paragon

Industries Inc-.,- a Glenpool,
Okla., producer of welded drill-
ing pipe. ”We just can't get
steel_.” -

Paragon’s raw material. is hot-
rolled steel, a relatively low-
value, semi—finished' product.

much steel as customers were
demanding, the 4—year—old com-

pany could triple its current sales

of approximately $1 million a
month. . »

”The market now is pretty hot
because our industry has gone
through a dramatic change in the
last 12 months,” he said.

With oil prices edging higher,
about 1,000 drilling rigs are in
operation in the United States, up
from around 600 last year. When
oil prices collapsed, the rig count
fell from nearly 4,000 early in the
decade, and drillers and their
suppliers took the plunge as well.

Similar forces have been at
work in the steel industry. An
abundance -of American metal
and cheap, imported steel collid-
ed with sluggish demand from oil
drillers and other steel users:

To match their diminished cir-
cumstances, steel producers
closed plants, slashed work
forces, trimmed wages and suc-
cessfully lobbied for import con-
trols, 'which have contained
foreign steel to roughly one—fifth
of the U.S. market.

With imports getting less U.S.
business, American producers are
experiencing higher demand.
Surviving domestic mills are be-

ing used more efficiently, order
books for most products are filled
through year's end" and prices
have stablized in the bargain.
”It’s more of a supplier's mar-

’ ket than it's been in quite some

time,” said Robert Toothman,
spokesman for National Steel
Corp., one of Paragon’s suppliers.
National’s mills are running vir-
tually flat out, and its order book
is full into January for its major
products: hot-rolled, cold-rolled
and coated sheet, he said
Tuesday. ‘ ’

”Hot rolled usually lags the I

others, and it's right out there
with them, maybe even leading
the pack,” Toothman said.
The sounds of satisfaction can
be heard.in some quarters.
”The people who used to be
able to snap their fingers and
have every steel company in the
world groveling at their feet are
finding that they have to do a lit-
tle more waiting,” said an execu-
tive for another major producer
who spoke on condition he not

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October 1, 1987 A

Dukakis-

Continued from page 1

Dukakis, a candidate for the
Democratic presidential nomi-
nation, at first refused to ac-
cept the resignation of
campaign manager James Sas-
so, who distributed the tape,
but Sasso and another staffer
resigned Wednesday af-
ternoon.

The disclosure came two
days after Dukakis said he had
interviewed all of his paid
staffers and was assured none
was the source of a videotape
showing that Biden had bor-
rowed, without attribution, a
moving and apparently per-
sonal passage from a speech
by British Labor Party leader
Neil Kinnock.

’’Although I had no
knowledge of this, as a candi-
date in this campaign I accept
full responsibility for it,” a
grim Dukakis said at a morn-
ing news conference.

Dukakis called Sasso’s ac-
tion ”a very, very serious er-
ror in judgment," but added,
”l think his contributions as a
public servant outweigh the
mistake.”

However, Sasso told report-
ers later that he persuaded
Dukakis to accept his resigna-
tion. Dukakis also accepted
the resignation of Paul Tully,
the campaign issues director
who was aware of the video
distribution, Sasso said.

Tully had joined the
Dukakis campaign after work-
ing for former Senator ‘Gary
Hart, the erstwhile Democrat-
ic front-runner who was
brought down by his associa-
tion with model Donna Rice.

Leslie Dach, a‘ campaign
-communications specialist,
was appointed acting manager
of the campaign.

Dukakis said he telephoned
Biden early Wednesday and
apologized. ‘

Biden withdrew’ from the
race last week amid con-
troversy over the tape and
other incidents of borrowed
rhetoric, and over disclosures
that he had misrepresented his
law school career.

In Washington, Biden had
nothing to say. ’’I think you
ought to talk to the governor.
I have no comment at all,” the
Delaware senator said.

the normal way of doing
business.” _

Other factors have complicat-
ed life among steel users like
Paragon.

Service centers, which buy
from mills, process the metal and
sell to users, apparently zigged
when they should have zagged
during the August-January Unit-
ed Steelworkers walkout at USX
Corp., the top U.S. steelmaker.

Anticipating that USX would
launch a price war to regain its
market share after settling with
the union, ”the service center
people really let their inventories
go down,” the executive said.
”They expected  a blood bath.
They felt, ’Let’s wait and fill‘ up
on cheap steel.’ ” ‘

‘USX returned to production
gradually, and prices held. Pipe
inventories were already low in
the oil patch because of the drill-
ing slump.

Polit said, ”You do get a lot of
people who do their shopping for
the week here, which I don't
know why because we are pret-
ty expensive.” .

These stores also do a lot of
business with students who are
studying late at night. ”We’ve got
these big mugs for soda drinks.
Well, [students] pulling [all-
nighters, especially around finals
time, they'll come in and buy one
of these cups and fill it with

‘ coffee. And sometimes they put

something like 18 sugars in it.”
said Polit.

Students cramming for a psy-
chology, anthropology, biology

A or any’ kind or manner of exam,

have no time to sleep. ”During fi-
nals we sell a lot of coffee, alot
of caffeine pills, a lot ofjunk food
to help [students] stay awake to
study and stuff like that,” said
Sheffler.

It seems that even a higher
price’ does not deter students
from shopping at these stores fre-
quently. Mainly because of the
short walk, these stores have be-
come 24-hour miniature super-
markets and study savers to
hungry and tired Pitt students.

Woman should tell

daughter

Q: Right after our wedding, we
left for California. Six months
later, our daughter was born. We
have always told her that her
birthday was May 30. In fact it
was Dec. 30, and someday she
will discover this.‘ Do we have to
tell her before she finds out for
herself?

WESTSHEIMER

A: Yes, I think you should tell
her before shefinds out for her-
self, or that precious t'rust be-
tween parent and child can be
endangered. You have to under-
stand yourself that your little
secret is not really anything to be
ashamed of, even if for your own
reasons, you prefer to keep it
quiet. 50 you can tell your daugh-
ter about it sometime in a
pleasant and natural way.

I won't say when to tell her.
Your mother's instinct will pick a
suitable age and occasion. You
can tell her that you have always
celebrated her birthday in May
instead of so close to Christmas
or Hanukkah because you and
her father were in love, and so
much in love that she was con-
ceived before you got married,
and you decidednot to attract too
much attention to_her real birth
date for a while. But that you real-
ly were in love, and you both
wanted to have her and were
very happy when she came.

' And now she is a big girl and
can understand, so you are tell-
ing her about her real birth date.
And now she can choose which
date she wants to have her party
on, Dec. 1 or the May 1. iwouid
definitely do that because it gives

the truth

her a part in deciding which will
be her special day. .

Q: My husband is always
touching himself down there in
public. It is a habit, but he gets
mad ifl mention it. Sometimes he
says he doesn't do it; sometimes
he says everyone does it, and it
isn't polite to notice, and some-
times he says something very
rude. H_e is really all right, but
how do I get him out of this
habit?

A: Put him in the hands» of a
custom tailor, who will see that
his clothes fit, and he doesn't al-
ways need to be adjusting. Or
buy him a kilt —- it is said to be
so comfy. And every time he
does touchhimself, scratch your
breast or your armpit, -and do it
so he can see.,He doesn't want
you doing this, so he'll quit.

Q: I met a Navy man,.and we
got along fine. We argued a lit-
tle, but then we talked things out,
and it became a great_ relation-
ship. Now he’s gone, and I’m
worrying that he may not return
or may come back not feeling the
same way. I worry about having
him off on long cruises if we get
married. Six months is a long
time apart. Does this sound like
something that could work out?

A: I am no prophetess; I have
no crystal ball — but you can take
steps and at least know that you
have done your best to keep this
going and to find out how it
works out. Don't let a silence fall
between you like a curtain -
write to him, send him postcards,
and ever better in this era, send
him some cassettes of your voice
telling him what is going on,
what you are doing, how you
miss him. Do that, and don't sit

and worry. Go out with friends, ,

keep your lifegrolling along.

FM, alias WYEP, a community ra-

complete rebirth.

Those of you that have gone
native to Pittsburgh recall the
”good ol’ days” of WYEP,
whenever their transmitter was
functioning, that is. Back then,
the station called itself communi-
ty access ~.radio.

WYEP always filled a void on
the FM dial that many listeners
appreciated. Although they used

L -to broadcast in mono, there was

never one commercial aired on

     

their station.

”We’re stereo now and broad-
casting with 1,200 watts,” said
WYEP Program Director Mikel
Ellcessor, ”and over half of our
staff are previous members, while
the others are familiar with the
WYEP radio tradition but offer
fresh ideas.”

”Our transmitter was literally
rebuilt by General Manager and
Chief Engineer Doug Bostrom;
Our transmitter was one of the
reasons that we were off the air
since October, 1985,” said Ell-
cessor. WYEP came back on the
air at 6 a.m. Sept. 10.

”We abandoned block pro-

image of what WYEP is, and
we're doing our best to accoma—

Two Women who
make a revolution

By Larry McShane

Associated Press Writer

NEW YORK — After appear-
ing in two movies, playing on
three, million-selling albums
and making the cover of Roll-
ing Stone magazine, Wendy
Melvoin and Lisa Coleman
still wonder if people know
them. —

”We have to think of it in
those terms, because there's a
lot of people we haven't
reached,” said Melvoin, the
guitarist with the Revolution,
Prince's multi-faceted backup
band, for the past five years.

The light rapping on their
debut album, Wendy and Lisa,
is a change from their days un-
der Prince’s purple reign,
when Melvoin and key-
boardist Coleman helped the
Minneapolis superstar break
musical and motion picture
ground with a series of ever-
evolving records. .

Coleman was a fixture on
Prince's records dating back to
Dirty Mind in 1978, while
Melvoin wound up joining the
band in time for the multi-
platinum Purple Rain movie
and soundtrack. They played
on the subsequent Around the
World in a Day and Parade
LPs and appeared in the disas-
trous movie, Under the Cher-

ry /vloon before the band went
its separate ways.

Along the way Prince began
recording their music: ”Some-
times It Snows in April” and
”Mountains” from the Parade
LP were co—written by the pair.

But unlike the rock-funk fu-
sion perfected by Prince, Mel-
voin and Coleman brought a
lighter, jazzier feel to their
project.

”Sounding like the Revolu-
tion wasn’t a concern of ours,
but it was of a lot of other peo-
ple,” said Melvoin, who co-
wrote most of the album with
Coleman in the studio. ”No .
‘one knew what to expect from
the two of us.”

The pair knew what to ex-
pect from one another — they
grew up together in California,
where their fathers were ses-
sion musicians in Los Angeles. A

”We’ve been familiar with
one another since wewere in
diapers,” Melvoin said in a tel-
ephone interview from Los
Angeles. ”We know our limi-
tations, and try to convince
each other we have none. It's
a bicycle built for two.”

After the dissolution of the
Revolution, the two went into
the studio within two weeks
and began working on the al-
bum — self—financed without
a record contract.

WHY WE A  
NEVER LET OUR
SALADS EXPOSE
THEMSELVES L

IN PUBLIC.

  

By Lisa L. Currin
For The Pitt News

Art speaks to thousands of
different people speaking thou-
sands of different languages.
Finding an artist who transfers a
language akin to our own ”Pitts-
burghese” from the streets to the
canvas is not a common occur-
rence. But Robert Qualters has
managed to do so.

In his exhibition that is current-
ly on display at the Marcus Gor-
don Gallery on South Craig
Street, Qualters has teamed up
with Jane McCreery and has
created a series of drawings
based on her poetry. Another in-
spiration was the medieval Book
of Hours, which is also the name
of the show.

A book of hours was a hand-
written diary used in private de-
votions. The manuals were for

laymen who documented their

vigils.

 

Artist captu res daily routine

Qualters’ art and McCreery’s
poems traverse the hours and
exist as small vignettes of the
boredom and the wonder each
day offers in varying degrees.

The drawings speak more of a
spontaneous interpretation than a
meticulous translation of the 24
poems that accompany the com-
positions.

The drawings speak a language
that resembles a ”visual Pittsbur-
ghese,” and for that reason are
esoteric. But, of course, Robert
Qualters is in every sense of the
word a Pittsburgh artist. He was
born in McKeesport, and his
work reflects his ties to the city.
Therefore, it is no wonder that his
drawings have a strong Pittsburgh
feel, and that the poems become
a part of that visual stance.

But there is also a certain eclec-
ticism in the collage-like styling
of the drawings. They are a
"pastiche of our daily rituals per-

formed out of habit and without

‘concentration. It is the poems that-

give meaning to the hours of the
day and create an introspective
fantasy. ‘

This is art of the moment, sus-
taining a sense of the‘present
while the present is still in effect.

In a chaos of color and strong an- en
gles, the mixed—media drawings ‘

capture the rhythms and confu-
sion of the day.-

Each drawing is an invitation to
ponder the moment it encapsu-
lates. So, in viewing the exhibit,‘
it is worthwile not to rush through
but to take the time to get in-
volved. ’

Overall, the impression left by
the drawings is not indelible be-
cause they do cater so much, to
the rue of the moment. Yet, to
stopand muse over the minutes
that pass so quickly in the course
of a day is what makes this ex-
hibit so enjoyable.

I . For the last four years, I've been
ll. : renting a house in a rather com-
»  fortable, urban residential area.
What's intertesting about my
. situation is that, through the
' years, I've shared the house with
graduate students from a variety
' of nations — Algeria, Egypt,
Burundi, France, Japan and South
, Korea — and a host of Americans
 A whose hometowns ranged from
Laurinburg, N.C., to Pinckney,
Mich., and from New York City
to Los Angeles.
Why would a person put him-
self through culture shock so
 often? Part of the reason is that
-' my landlord controls who comes
and goes. This is good because
_ the responsibility of finding
f housemates has been taken away
 from me-. And when my landlord
_,is,unsuccessful in his search, I
 havethe place to myself — with
no change in my rent. The other
part of the reason is that the setup
-,1. is so educational.
Having been privileged
it enough to sit in on many break-
  fasts, ’ which, at times, have
j. resembled sca|ed—down UN
 daybreak briefings, many of my
‘ misconceptions about other na-
‘"7 tions and their p_eople‘V,,have been
_top_pled'. You knfA(_)}2.v,;_;,hc>’vi/“people

as the first misconception to end
up in rubble.

When considering the inevita-
bility of cultures and personalities
butting heads,, you'll find it
strange, I'm. sure (as I have), that
the major shocks I've received
haven't come from my foreign
housemates. I've had a more
difficult time understanding and
getting along with Americans.

Apart from religious convic-
tion, what's shocked me most has
been how much _my foreign
friends and acquaintances know
about our country and how little
we Americans know about theirs.

Take, "for example, my friend
from Algeria. V A

In the two years we've lived
together," we've established a
solid friendship. The funny thing
is, our relationship has been
much more intimate and reward-
ing than most of those I'd estab-
lished with American’s who've
passed through the house.

The other night, a couple of us
were sitting around watching
good, old American MTV when

Andy Warhol's name came up in

conversation.
My Algerian friend immediate-

4 ly chimed in with some thought-

ful observations about Warhol,
his work and the counterculture
in general. But what of my mate
from the thriving metropolis of
Los Angeles? The name Andy
Warhol meant nothing to him.
I have to tell you that, in the
pastfew years, my American
housemates have embarassed me
time and time again. How is it
that a person who grew up half-
way around theworld can quote

lines from Bob Dylan's songs i

when my American housemates
sometimes get Bob Dylan‘ con-
fusedwith Matt Dillon, the sheriff

_ '~‘-,_r,f‘\'I;T,.1,j§.Fi"'€‘._6:l'_.',is so rich in so_-many

 
 

and, if he's straight with you, he'll
admit’ it (though sometimes
grudgingly). Why would so many
foreigners want to come here if
this were noftrue?

I was touched, one evening, by
a story a foreign friend had told
me about his route to America.
He was and still is in this coun-
try pursuing advanced studies.-

He told me of the intense com-
petition in his country to be one

of those selected to -receive a_

scholarship to study in America.
Only a handful were to get_the
nod, and when it came to the end
of the evaluation process, he had
done well but was considered a
borderline candidate. ‘

The way he tells it, he
panicked. He had dreamed of
traveling to the United States
since hewas five years old. He
had watched many American
movies and read much about
America and the West. He was
completely taken and was com-
mitted to making thejourney.

After an agonizing wait, he was
made aware that he would in-
stead be sent to school in Paris.
Now, to you and me, that doesn't
soundbad. To him, it was his
worst nightmare come true.

In the weeks following this
notification, my friend made all
the rounds, nonstop, to all the
pertinent government offices. He
barely slept. His message was

_ this. "I’m going to the United

States, or I'm going nowhere’."’
He felt as if his life was being
taken from him.

After much perseverance, the
powers—that—be yielded. He got
his chance to come to the Unit-
ed States and has been here
studying ever since. ’

What impresses me about my

friend is that, while I enjoy listen- ~

ing to his speech_,—.—_he occasion-

_ ”a"ll.y-g mispr',orjounce's _. things,-',
.‘;:.;tI19i18h his accenti'trteke$.it.is0uPd1:.

Foreign views yieldcultural shock

language as well as or better than
most Americans I know. He's into
the Hollywood films and loves
Madonna and nightclubs. In
short, good or bad, he appreci-

_ ates America more than any of

the Americans I've lived with.
If I've learned anything from
my friend, it's that America is
truly the place to be in the world.
I have alsolearned how Ameri-
ca is often perceived overseas,

_ which isn't always good. This has '

helped to ‘soften my inbred
American sense of hegemony
and complacency.

And I've learned that we
Americans, despite the fact that
our nation is just over two centu-
ries old, have a viable and, in
many ways, enviable culture of
our own. It's a shame more of us
don't realize this and take advan
tage of it. i _ ’

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October l, 1987

‘I3

Coach may face difficult decisions

 

JOHN
ENRIGHT

While the set of circumstances
involving the alleged beating of
a few‘Pitt students by three mem-
bers of the Panther Basketball
team is still in question, one thing
is for sure. Basketball coach Paul
Evans will be under an inordinate
amount of pressure when decid-
ing upon proper punishments for
Jerome Lane, Demetreus Gore
a_nd Steve‘Maslek _— the alleged
attackers — if -they are found
guilty of the crime.

Defining it more narrowly,
what is the proper disciplinary ac-
tion for Lane and Gore— two of
Pitt's best players -— if their ac-
tions are ascertained as guilty?

What about Maslek? Well, let's

be honest._‘He, really doesn’t_
mean anything to Pitt's national

championship hopes. That fact
alone should make it even more
interesting to see if equal punish-
ment is handed out to Gore, Lane
and Maslek, given that charges
are pressed against them, and

they are found guilty of those

charges.

Other comment-worthy rumi-
nations from the angst-filled
abyss:

0 I took my first test of the year
yesterday, and after taking exams
at this university for three years,
it's incredible how my views of
test—taking have changed.

Three different attitudes have
prevailed from my years of fret-
ting over exams. One, I no longer
get nervous. Two, I no longer
really care how I do. And three,
I've reduced the amount of time
I spend guessing to almost zero
seconds.

As soon as I know I'm not sure
of an answer, I've already started
to fill in B. -

0 Why I ever was looking for-
ward to this school year, I'll never
know. Whoever is enjoying their
senior year, please come see me
at the William Pitt Union and ex-
plain how you've managed to do
so.

°There’s a rumor going
around that certain university em-
ployees have been given free

, tickets to football games.-‘to report

on the behavior of the students.

Whether or not that is true,
anyone who judges the Pitt stu-
dents’ behavior as distasteful has
never seen what a really rowdy
collegiate crowd is like.

However, playing night games
will undoubtedly raise the num-
ber of students who get intoxicat-
ed and act belligerently.

Why? _ ‘

Well, it's a lot easier to get up
at noon to start drinking for a 7
p.m. game than it is to crawl out
of bed at eight or nine in the
morning to tailgate for a noon or
1:30 p.m. start.

And the Pitt Athletic Depart-
ment was wondering why stu-
dent attendance at football games
has been down the last few years.

Afternoon games don't cut it
with a college crowd that likes to
drink.

0 For those Bloom County fans
out there, Berke Breathed won
the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for
editorial cartooning, which
caused quitean uproar among
the nation's top editorial car-
toonists.

They didn't think a cartoon
strip which comes out six days a
week and that fails to pinpoint
current political and social issues
deserved consideration.

Criticism of Breathed also
stemmed from the fact many feel
he got the idea for Bloom County
from one ofthe characters in
Gary Trudeau’s Doonesbury

strip.

I happen to think Breathed’sl '

strip provides an excellent com-

»menta.ry on society. What I like s

most is that Bloom County

doesn't take itself so seriously; as '

many other strips and all too
many editorial cartoonists do.

0 Speaking of cartoon strips,»

, trust me, Zippy The Pinhead is on"

the way soon. No, he hasn't been
kidnapped. He's just been on a
long vacation.

0 The feeling among college
journalists is that you don't need
a degree nearly. as much as you
need good clips of the stories
you've written to get a newspaper
job.

Well, now that I don't think I
want to get into journalism,

maybe I better start taking aca— K

demics seriously.

But considering my views of
test—taking, it's probably too late.

0 Doesn't it seem a little
strange that a Pitt student has yet
to walk into the bus lane on Fifth
Avenue and get nailed by a PAT
bus?

Don't worry. It will happen be-

fore the year's over.

0 Don't despair. There's only
72 days left until the last day of
fall classes.

Encouraging, isn't it?

/ohn Enright is the editor in I.

chief for The Pitt News. _

In a nutshell 

The other night in a bar room, I saw one man turn to another, who
had been pesteringhim with drunken nonsense. "Son,” he said, ”you

bettercalmyourself, because if you don

Western here for a minute.”

Trust me 

Well, in fine Ramones tradition, they
have a\N EW drummer. It seems thatClem
Burke lasted only two weeks. They've
replaced him with one of their past drum-
mers, Marky Ramone. I guess Clemmie
Ramone sounded too stupid  Locally a
similar situation is going on. The drum-
mer for The Cynics retired his drum sticks.
The garage gods auditioned a bunch of
bangers and found a replacement.

He quit after one rehearsal (no
comment).

Anyway Bill Von Hagen came out of
retirement until another replacement is
found.

If you're interested, call Greg at

745-6468  Looks like Arista will be put— .

ting out a new Patti Smith album at the
begining of 1988 .;. Locals The Heretics
will be putting out their first single
”Search and Destroy” very soon.

It will be on Get Hip Records. I’~m dy-

ing to hear the flip side of ”Lesbian
Grudge Match!”  If you are a fan of
Roland S. Howard(probably best known
for his work with Nick Cave) you must
hear his new band, These Immortal
Souls.

They have a 12 inch called "Marry Me
(Lie, Lie)” that is hauntingly outstanding.
It's an import on Mute Records  The
Balancing Act will be in town on Oct. 15.
These guys are a terribly unpretentious,
folky-but—powerfu| must-see.

Hear their song ”A Girl, Her Sister and
a Train," and I guarantee you won't be
able to stop humming it for 3-5 hours.
They have a new album out next week.
 Can you believe Aztec Camera has a
new slab 0' vinyl on the way?

Lead singer,-Roddy Frame is the guy El-
vis Costello hailed as the entire future of
rock ’n’ roll. This is Aztec Camera’s third
record. - I guess we'll see.  Another
WPTS Birthday Bash is creeping up on us
(they're either 3 or 4). This year it's featur-

Membranes and other stuff

ing Johnny Rhythm & the Dimestore 45s,
Hector in Paris, The 11th Hour and The
Affordable Floors. (I hear the Floors are
now covering Led Zep's ”Cashmere.”
Hmmm, do I really want to hear that?)

Details are forthcoming  Pere Ubu is
reuniting and taking it on the road. They'll
be in our town on Oct. 29. It just so hap-
pens that in a real schlock/rock magazine
from Nov. 1979, I found I review of Pere
Ubu that says ”  we can't figure it out,
but we know that the more we listen to
it, the more hypnotic it becomes. Try it
if you dare."

The rest of the review was way off—base,
but the above still applies.  There's a
rumor that John C. Mellencamp will be
in town in. November. You heard it from

me first. His latest, The Lonesome lubilee -

is one hell of a record. To borrow an ap-
propriate observation from. a friend of
mine: Although it's the first ofJCM’s last
six records that hasn't blown the one be-

. fore it away (got that*?), The Lonesome

lubilee picks up where Scarecrow left off. 

Mellencamp will be 36' on Oct.-7.

 

Here are some exciting things that hap-  *?i='
pened this week in history: Sting will be  
36 on Oct. 2.  Janis Joplin died on Oct. I "V

4, 1970.  Two big things happened on

Oct 6 — in 1966--LSD was outlawed and ‘ 

in 1980 John Lyndon was arrested for as‘-
saulting a b_arman.  On Oct. 8 in 1980,
Bob Marley collapsed while performing
in Pittsburgh, and Johnny Ramone will
turn 37.

I GOT A LETTER THIS WEEK!! It's from I,

a band called 1221. I've never heard

them, but the letter said the band includes ’ 
men that I ”wouldn’t throw out of bed, 

even if they ate crackers." I like them al-
ready! If you want to know about 1221
call their hotline at 731-7415.

If you want to know more about me, "

send a letter addressed to Lovely Lola Fee

But it gets worse. His full name
is Bart Savagewood. He tests fight-
er jets for the navy, catches sharks
for fun, wrestles alligators and
benches 290 pounds. Opus calls
him ”The Human Chin.”

Opus’ life is rejuvenated when
he becomes a Boinger. A Boinger
is a part of Billy and The Boingers,
a quasi-punk, heavy-metal rock
band headed by Steve Dallas, the
slovenly leader of the band.

Steve is a lawyer who is tired of
defending murderers and rapists
and opts for a job where he doesn't
have to wear a tie. Thus begins
Deathtongue, a four—piece band of
tongue-strumming Bill Cat, Hodge
on drums, Opus on rhythm elec-
tric tuba and Dallas as the
manager/singer/songwriter.

Morsholl Clork/The Pitt News

Boston College plans to groundon Pitt

By Christopher Sepesy

Sports Editor

Time keeps on s/ipp_in', slip-
pin’, slippin', into the future 
There are some people at least
who would like to see a few ex-
pected visitors fly like eagles this
weekend, namely the Pitt Pan-

thers. They would like to see

them take flight over offensive
lines, under defensive feet and
away from possible goalmkers.

And who are these unwanted
winged intruders?

Namely the Eagles of Boston
College.

"We're concerned about the
match—ups this weekend," said
Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried.
’'It could get tricky. They are a
very tough football team who
could possibly take us by surprise
like Temple did if we're not
careful. ,

"And," he continued, "they
are definitely both the best offen-
sive and defensive team we've

- faced to date. Jack Bicknell is an

outstanding coach. And he is also
a true gentleman.”

Well, this "true gentleman" is’.

at the present time trying to make
an gentleman's agreement with
his own squads. He doesn't know
how they'll react to the Panthers
or how the Panthers will react to
them.

There are going to be some ex-
plosions this Saturday and only
the final buzzer will determine
who will emerge v.ictorious,"-said
Bicknell. "Mostly, though, it will
be an explosion of philosophies.
Basically, either they're going to
hurt us, or we're going to hurt
them.” ' ’ 4

The volatile philosophies in
question here are the offense pat-
terns of each team. Boston Col-
lege . uses a multiple offense
system, while the Panthers,
although they may state they» use
the Run and Shoot, have primar-
ily used just the Run this. year.
And this could be due to the
enormous presence of Craig

".lronhead" Heyward, a player

Bicknell has already seen.
"He's monstrous in power,”
said Bicknell, "and could tend to
be unstoppable if the opposing
team isn’t‘prepared."' '

  'Bic,_kn_ell , —_knows_ or ,».wi.a; he i

 

speaks. when talking about ‘run-
ning backs. Last weekend, he and
his team faced the Penn State Nit-
tany Lions (a team about which
every Panther fan knows) and
their star running back Blair Tho-
mas. Let’s just say Thomas gave

. the Eagles a pretty good workout

in the 27-17 Penn State win.

"He wasvery, very quick,”
said Bicknell, "and- purely an all-
around athlete. I think Heyward
could prove to be the same way.

'’I just hope Heyward can slow
down during the second half, and
that we will be able to contain
him.”

One of the major questions this
week is just how much Gottfried
will be using Heyward, since that
last week he had him in for the
whole game against West Vi_r-
ginia. And even though he has
been referred to by Pitt's Sid
Gillman as "a 10 pack back —
he'll get through even if he's car-
rying six of theirs and four of
ours," his fatigue nearing the last
quarter was clearly evident. Hey-
ward's replacement has been

Adam Walker forythe. last few“,
' gajrr‘_i_:e_'s,)' and 7.Walker. =_h*as_ shown-

 

that he too might just have the
right stuff. ’
’'I hate to take-Craig out of the

v game,” said Gottfried. ''I really

like tc/)__have his presence on the
field. He has that natural ability.
to lead, and that's what any
coach wants on the field at any
time. Both he and Sal [Genilla]
really know how to take charge.
"But the one really good thing
about Adam [Walker]," Gottfried
continued, "is that he is really a
darter and really picksup the
pace of the game.” _
Another clash of wills during
this game might be the quarter-
back spot, the "Shoot" part of
each of their offenses. Boston
College's Mike Power, who has
accumulated 1,100 yards'already
this season in only four games, is
obviously talented and ex-
perienced. Pitt's Genilla has been
showing of late .some signs of
weakness and inaccuracy.
What do the coaches think?
"Genilla, although he has
made some mistakes, is an excel-
lent quarterback," said Bicknell.
"He’s got a, good release and has

f ;g,r‘ea_t' balance,‘ 3,35%.-;¢hat.'s .so_r,n‘¢-_..V'

thing you need to be in the posi-
tion he is in."

"Power has an exceptionally.

strong arm and has outstanding

accuracy,” said Gottfried. "Our. ,
defense is really going to have t0‘. 

be on their toes."

Overall, though, both coaches
hope to see a game -which will
actually prove a victory.

"Pitt presents problems for any
team," said Bicknell, "but espe-

cially us. You always have to play”
them like a wild card, and if.

we're not careful, they're going to
get us. ‘ _ ’

"We can't take this game light-
ly,” said Gottfried., "We've got

to give them all we've got. A lot ‘

is resting on this game."
But Bicknell added this,

"Thelast two weeks we've i

played hard but don't have any-
thing to show for it. I hope all that
changes because I don't want to
be down on Sunday."

It should be safe to say the Pan-'

_thers will be happy when the Ea— =  . 

gles of Boston College get on that _. “

«' S Staff Writer

This Saturday's lineup of games
in college football has got to be
just about the weakest offering of

' _» the year. It’-s almost enough to

make me wish the NFL strike

. iW€I'€ over.

Sure, Iowa vs. Michigan State,
Auburn vs. North Carolina and
Pitt vs. Boston College are pretty
decent games, but they're just not
in a class with Nebraska-Arizona

S» J State, Michigan-Notre Dame or

Auburn-Tennessee —— games
which we've seen during the first
four weeks of the season.

The dead giveaway to a lean

' week in college football is when

Wake Forest vs. Army is being
televised throughout the
Northeast.

' But the week is not a total loss.
At least two games are more than
worthy of their national television
audience.

Miami at Florida State may be
the best game so far this year. The
winner of this game should be
made No. 1 in the polls if Okla-
homa struggles at all with Iowa

, State, but don't count on it.

Pitt gra

JOHNSTOWN, Pa. (AP) ~ Ron
Sams has lost 30 pounds and
some of his ability since he last
played pro football, but he sud-
denly finds himself as the Pitts-
burgh Steelers’ most experienced
offensive lineman.

‘ ‘ Sams, who joined the Steelers’
‘strike-team workouts Tuesday,
was cut by the New York Jets last
year after previously playing for
the Green Bay Packers and Min-

 

Florida at LSU is worth watch-
ing, if only to see what the real
meaning of home-field advantage
is. The winner of this game also
happens to have a great shot at
the Sugar Bowl.

Last week's record — 9,-3

For the year — 13-8

Miami-26 Florida State-24

I've never been more im-
pressed with a team than I was
with Miami last week as they
romped all over previously 10th-
ranked Arkansas 51-7 at Little
Rock. Some say expectations are
too high at Florida State, but their
31-3 victory over Michigan State
says otherwise. A great game.

Michigan-35 Wisconsin-3

Wisconsin has some of the
most loyal fans in college football
filling their large stadium week af-
ter week to watch mediocre foot-

ball. This week, Michigan fans '

will once again fill Michigan
Stadium to watch superior
football.

Ohio State-24 Illinois-10

The Illinois program is sagging,
and doesn't figurejto improve on
last year's 4-7 record. Ohio State
proved itself last week in tying
LSU in Baton Rouge.

ANALYSIS

Pitt-20 Boston College-10

A win against BC will raise
Pitt's record to 4-1 and bring
them to the edge of the Top 20.
Boston College deserves a better
fate than the 2-3 record they will
carry after this game.

West Virginia-30
Carolina-7

This game is actually some-
what of a breather on East Caro-
lina’s ambitious (stupid?)
schedule. Some breather.

Upset of the Week

Michigan State-24 Iowa-17

Michigan State will rebound
strong from the 31-3 beating ad-
ministered by Florida State, but
their athletic director should still
be castrated for scheduling USC,
Notre Dame, Florida State, Iowa
and Michigan to open the season.
On second thought, maybe he

Second Upset of the Week

North Carolina State-26
Georgia Tech-24

The Wolfpack shocked the
ACC last week with their 42-14
rout of Maryland. Freshman quar-
terback Preston Poag started his
first game last week and may be
the spark that ignites NCS.

LSU-14 Florida-10

Freshman running back Emmitt
Smith gained 173 yards on just
20 carries last week for Florida,
but LSU will take a major step
toward returning to the Sugar
Bowl with this win.

Tulsa-27 Kansas State-10

I'll bet you think Tulsa is pret-
ty bad in losing to Oklahoma by
65 while gaining just about 50
yards in total offense. Well, KS is
the worst team of the 20th cen-
tury. Really. Look it up.

UCLA-21 Stanford-10

Stanford is the biggest disap-
pointment of 1987 at 0-3, going
on 0-4. Gaston Green, who has
been slightly disappointing so far
for the Bruins at running back,
needs a big day to put himself
back on the minds of the Heis-
man voters.

Sams tries comebackwith

nesota Vikings. The former
University of Pittsburgh guard
weighs 240 pounds, 30 pounds
less than he weighed with the
Jets.

Sams said he doesn't "come
with any guarantees" but is anx-
ious to see if he still can play. He
is the only one of the Steelers’
nine strikebreaking offensive line-
men who has played in the NFL.

Moss provides leadership

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

A ”I see myself as a role model
on this team,” said senior mid-
fielder Dave Moss. ”I go out there
and try my hardest each game,
and hope for the best.”

This year's Pitt soccer team has

a strong lack of experienced play-
ers. Only three seniors have
returned from last year, and head
coach Joe Luxbacher has had to
do a great bit of shuffling. Yet
with Moss on the field, he knows
that there is somebody to count
on.

”Dave is definitely one of our
team leaders,” said Luxbacher.
”He is one of themost consistent
players around. Dave gives his all
every game.”

Moss grew up in State College,
Pa., the heart of Nittany Lion
country. Still, he never gave
thought to attending Penn State.

’’I’d have to say that 99 percent
of my high school class decided
to go to State,” said Moss. ”It
would have seemed like four
more years of high school. I
didn't want that, I wanted to get
out on my own. I wanted a
change of scenery, just get away
from the area for awhile.”

This year, ‘Dave has been trou-
bled by a slipped disk in his back;
Yet he has still managed to be an
offensive force on a teamthat has
seen its offense disappear during
games. In seven games this year,

Moss has compiled five goals and '
-a number of assists. '

”Dave is a real positive force
out on the field,” said junior
defenseman Matt Segedy. ”His

injury has hampered him during ,

games, but he seems to be able
to‘ overcome it. We really count
on his scoring.”

_”I don't let my back bother
me,” said Moss. ”I just take a
couple of days off here and there,

but it is going to hurt me for the
rest.of the year. I just won't let it
alter my performance during a
game. I'm just going to play now
and worry about it later.

”Joe [Luxbacher] deserves all
the credit for the team. He came
here when Pitt soccer was noth-
ing, and really turned it around.
He is very knowledgeable about
the game, and that makes him a
good coach. He has a way of get-
ting the best play out of every-
body. He deserves a lot of respect
for that/’said’Moss. ' .

Off the field, Moss is a physics
major and a good student. A
”Sometimes it is hard to get all of
my work done. Especially on
long road trips. Riding on a bus
for four hours is not the best way
to study. A few times my work
slips, but I wouldn't give up one
for the other. I enjoy playing soc-
cer very much.” ' -

Even with the lack of ex-’

perience, Dave still sees a good
mix of players.

I ”We have a lot of potential on
this team, once we get everybody
working together. In alfew games
this year we haven't had I 1 guys
playing at the same time. That‘
hurts our chances, and gets us in
trouble. With a good effort by
everyone, we can beat anyone,”
said Moss. '

Dave has been a starter for all
four of his years at Pitt. There
have been a lot of changes
around him in those years, yet he
has seemed to be able to stand
aboveit

’’I’m never worried _ about
Dave,” said Luxbacher. ”I just
put him out there, and once the
whistle blows he gives his best.
If all of my players were of the
same caliber as Dave, I wouldn't
have many problems at all.”

Moss and the rest of his Panther
teammates will face Canisius Col-
lege on Wednesday Oct. 7, 7:15
p.m. at Pitt Stadium. '

these people? How long is this
going to last?’ ” ’

”But after a couple of lessons,
things started coming together.
They're improved. They learned
quickly. They are very promis-
ing,” Greene said.

’’I’m disappointed the players

' aren't getting the chance to play,

but I'm excited and pleased about
the opportunity these young peo-
ple. are getting -because of the

H .~ "strike/’ he said.

The Steelers have given out
some of their veterans’ numbers
to the strike team — Louis Lipps’

This is rock ’n' roll.

 

No. 83 has gone to wide receiver
Mel Anderson, for example.

”i don't recognize these guys
as players, and lreally don't have
a whole lot of respect for them,”
said nose tackle Edmund Nelson.
”And it's very hard for me to like
them as human beings, if you
really want to come down to it.”

Nelson told the Pittsburgh Post-
Cazette that a player should try
to win an NFL job during train-
ing camp, not during a strike.—

”l don't think they realize the
weight of what they're doing,”
Nelson said. ’’I think they're in
there thinking it's some kind of
joke and ‘Well, heck, I'll make

myself a few bucks and pass the -

time.’

’’It doesn't come down to that.
You're a strikebreaker, and [you
are] being used by NFL manage-
ment to‘ put pressure on actual
NFL players, and therefore  I
don't really have a good feeling
about them,” he said.

Nelson said striking players
will picket Three Rivers Stadium
next week when the strike team
begins practicing there. .

”They’re trying their best to
stay outof town, but sooner or
later, they're going to have to
come to Pittsburgh, and I'll be

glad to see them. I'd like to ‘see’

them have the audacity to come
to Pittsburgh,” Nelson said.

Pitt students bring home the gold in karate

By Thomas Zuck
Staff Writer

Three Pitt students competed- in
the National Police Athletic
League T'ae—Kwon-Do & Karate
Championships, Sept. 18-20, in
Columbus, Ohio.

Brad Bentz, David Schurz and
Brian Volpe were representing
the newly formed Western Penn-

sylvania Police Athletic League.‘

The three qualifiedfor the nation-
al championships by winning

their respective classes at the

Sept. 13 Police Athletic
League/UPT Open Invitational
Martial Arts Tournament held in
Donora, Pa. .

Bentz took the bronze medal in

the heavyweight advanced divi— .

sion. He had some difficulty ad-
justing to the international rules
that were in effect, as opposed to
the American rules that were in
affect for the PAL/U PT tour-
nament. ‘
Curtis Smith, Bentz’ instructor,
said, ”He [Bentz] should have
been in the finals. He outclassed
the guy, but it came down to a
judge's decision.” _
Some of the differences include
the length of the rounds as one

. progresses toward the finals. The

early rounds were two minutes

each of continuous fighting.

When they got to the semifinals,
there were two two-minute‘
rounds of continuous fighting.

The other glaring difference
was that in Tae-Kwon-Do, the
judges look mostly for kicks in-
stead of punches.

Schurz captured the gold
medal‘ in the men's ‘lightweight
black belt division.

”I didn't expect to do so well,”

he said. ”I was viewing it as a
learning experience.”
An experienced fighter, Schurz

has participated in this type of a.

‘tournament for some time.

”I wanted to keep my hands up
and not get knocked out,” he
said. ”I did’ not win this tourna-
ment because of anything special
I did. My stamina was not where

I wanted it to be, and my train-

”I won this mostly because of
my prior training — when you
feel that you can't throw another
punch you have to throw two.”

Schurz also had to endure a
longer 'fight.alorig with the7Hiffer-
ent rules. , _

”Nine minutes is a long time to
fight. In the end, it came down to
who wanted it more. Luckily,rI
wanted it more,” said Schurz.

Volpe, fighting in his second

‘tournament, also viewed it as a

learning experience. ’’I didn't
really know what to expect,” he
said. 9 .

Volpe, a natural middleweight,
was pushed up into the

L heavyweight division. His inex-

perience in tournaments did
work against him, which he
found out too late.

”I threw alot of hand,tech-
niques, which I found out later
they rarely scored,” said Volpe.

self next .time.”

3.’:  “Part of the Pitt volleyball team's
‘success this year (their record is
f ; 13-2) is due to the performance

of outside hitter Denise Frawley.

Frawley, atjunior from Thorn-
wood, NY, leads the team in kills
(156) and is nationally respected
for her spiking. Head coach Shel-
‘ton Collier said, ”Denise has
‘played a major role in our suc-

I _ cess this year.”

 Before deciding to go to Pitt,
.'Frawley sent Coach Collier a
videotape about which he said,
”I was more impressed with

' ..-Denise than with any other play-

er I've ever recruited.”
Frawley chose Pitt because,
”|t’s one of the best divisional
_schools. I liked it when I visited,
and Coach Collier is a really good

'l*coach/"

' For‘ the "past two summers,
Frawley has gone to the Nation-

al Olympic Festival. Only the top‘ '

48 collegiate players, age 21 and
under, are chosen, and they help

Olympics. Frawley said, ”The
level of play is so high and ad-
vanced."

So far-this season, Frawley has
been named to two all-
tournament team — at Temple
and at the Purdue Classic. At Pur-
due, Frawley was the only Lady
Panther selected. Frawley’s per-
formance was also a key factor in
Pitt's victory against Georgia.
Coach Collier said, ”Denise was
outstanding. She, lead our win
with 15 kills.”

Collier went on to say, ”I’m
very proud of Denise. It's gratify-
ing for me as a coach to see so
much progress. Because of her
improvement, attitude, determi-

' nation and consistency, it's been

very rewarding for me to work
with her.”

Collier said, ”This year, Denise
has made a lot of gains. She's
showing a lot of leadership, and

she has made tremendous de-

velopments in defense. She's
grown into an excellent all-

mented, ”It used to be impossi-
ble for her to train as hard as
necessary. But this year, she
hasn't had as many problems,

and she can practice much hard-

er. Plus she doesn’t have to sit out
as much.”

Frawley added, ”|t’s frustrating .

because for two years, I've
earned a starting position in the
Olympic Festival three. matches,
and both years by the middle
match, I had to sit out. But this
year, it hasn't been as bad. "I've

time last year, I couldn't practice;
I just played in the matches.’_’.

Frawley feels that this year's
team could go all the way; ”We
have more experience this year.

Six of our starters returned from-

last year. We have some pretty

solid players, and that will pay 0 '

One of Fraw|ey’s goals for this

five-strikeout performance against
the Mets as just one game this
season. He didn't buy momen-
tum carrying over until next year.
’’I don't think you carry any-

_thing over from one year to the

next. Heck, last year we finished
strong and everybody thought we

vwere going to win it big this

year.” J.

He said what he has to do is
remember why he started win-
ning, why he’s pitching better.

”That’s what I have to carry
over,” he said.

Phillies’ pitching coach Claude -
‘Osteen attributes‘ Carman’s im-

provement to two things.
”He’s_ challenging the hitters

more. ,He’s stopped nibbling.’

He's using his good fastball and
curve and mixing them up.” _
The other is junking a split-
finger chan‘ge—up. Elia and Osteen
convinced him the pitch was
hurting more than helping.
”Since he junked the split-
finger, his fastball hasmore ve-
locity,” Osteen said. _
Carman said the pitch he threw
to Wilson in the fourth was a
mistake. _
”I meant to bounce a curve in
the dirt, because I know'he’lI
chase a breaking pitch. But I

.didn’t bounce it. Igot it knee

high._” . . .

Carman said beating the Mets
made the victory even more
special.’ ' '

PREGAME

THE PITT NEWS FOOTBALL SUPAPLEMENTB

PlTl' STADIUM, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

The winner of this one mig

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer

Forget any corny similes about Panthers
grounding Eagles and Eagles out dive-
bombing Panthers. From the looks of
things, Saturday's Pitt—Boston College

matchup is gonna be nothing less than at

knockdown, dragout dogfight minus any
consolation wreaths. And here is the un-
disputed evidence why:

O Respect. One thing the BC Eagles

have somehow not managed to earn, at
least in the sea—to—shining-sea perspective,
is the year-in-year-out respect of the rest
of the country's programs and fans. Sure,
when the magical Doug Flutie was be-
hind center, everbody peaked through the

keyhole to see what the Eagles were do-

ing — commotion is always caused when
the circus comes to town. But since
Flutie’s been gone, BC has once again be-
come ”another one of those eastern
teams” in the eyes of the Barry Switzers

Ploul.Kromer/The Pitt News

 

and Bo Schembechlers of the game.

Pitt, on the other hand, has already won
the acknowledgement of the country with
its magnificently dominating perfor-
mances of the '70s. That's why the poll-
sters were so quick to land the Panthers
at No. 16 after the team won its first two
games. Hey, BC won its first two games
and had trouble making USA Today's Top
25. Tradition somehow has a way of
speaking for itself when it comes to popu-
lar gridiron opinion.

Where does respect come in to play?
The Eagles have already lost to national
powers USC (23-16) and Penn State
(27-17). Another loss here, and recruiting
advantages will be about nil for head
coach Jack Bicknell’s squad. As for the
Panthers, they've got to beat everybody
to keep the steam pumping in the pro-
gram's uphill search for resurrection.

0 Bulk versus Bulk.The football will be
caught between a hard place and a rock
when these two teams take the field. Pitt's
defensive line averages 6-foot-5, 260
pounds. Some pretty big boys, right? Their
tango partners on BC’s offensive line
check in at an average of 6-foot-4, 275

9 pounds. Pitt takes an inch but gives 15

pounds. Look for the Eagles to attempt to
run dead up the middle, thereby neu-
tralizing Pitt's overall quickness.

0 The Aerial War. BC isn't trying to fool
anyone‘— it likes to throw the football.
Junior quarterback. Mike Power has
thrown for over 1,100 yards this season
while completing 57 percent of his pass-

pm vs. BOSTON COLLEGE

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 3, 1987, 7:00 PM.

ht Drove all  

es. ”Boston College is solid at that posi-

tion,” said Pitt head coa_ch Mike

Gottfried./’He’s definitely got a strong‘ _'

arm, and that concerns us.”
0 Meanwhile, Power will be throwing

into one of the top secondaries in the-

country. Pitt's pass defense has allowed

only 133.5 yards per game, the 20th~best_ 9

mark in the Division 1 football. However,
Power will provide the unit with its tough-
est test so far this season."

0 A Revenge Factor? Although coaches

and players never like to admit it, you al-- 9 ll

ways want to knock off the guys that
knocked you off before — call it the sports
section of human nature. in 1985, BC

came down to Pittsburgh and stole away .

a 29-22 victory from Foge Fazio’s Pan--. 
thers. A sleight-of-hand, right—before-your-  ‘i 
very-eyes kind ofa loss. True, the present ' ' ’

coaching staff was off in Kansas or some

-other bizarre sector of the map at the

time, but a relatively big majority of the
players were around for that Fazio foot-
ball folly; it's pretty certain they remem-

ber that ”defeat stolen from the jaws of.
victory” feeling. And tempers could flare.

Despite all of these conjectural points

of interest, BC will be, without question, .

the toughest opponent that Pitt has faced
this far into 1987. A couple of breaks

against Southern Cal and Penn State, and  ' l

BC could be boasting an unblemished
record —— it's been that close. As for the
Panthers? After watching the team's per-
formance slump over the past two weeks,
it's gonna take a much improved effort to
— oh, what the heck — ground the Eagles.
