Student Government Board
member Ahmie Baum’s resigna-
tion was accepted by President
Bernie Payne yesterday, leaving

— the Board with a vacancy that could

be ﬁlled before the end of June-.
In a letter to Payne, Baum said
he had mixed emotions concerning

the Board’s actions and effective-

ness during its ﬁrst four months in
ofﬁce. While saying he hoped the

Board accomplished its goals, he i

said he believed students could

a have expected more from Payne’s

Board than they have received.

Payne yesterday said he ac-
cepted Baum’s decision with “deep
regret,” and that “it has been a
pleasure serving with him,” but
added he found fault with Baum’s
stated reasons for leaving.‘

“Government, takes time,”
Payne said. “Some people don’t
realize the procedures and bureau-
cracy involved and don’t want to
wait for things to take place.

“I .don’t think the Board has
wasted time working toward its
goals,” he added. “It could be that
some expected too much from, us
too soon.”

Payne said the process of
selecting a replacement for Baum
would begin next week, with
applications being taken and
interviews held before any candi-
dates are brought in for a Board
vote. i

lBut SGB member Dave Hesi-

found this month, the Board, which
must elect the replacement by
majority vote, would wait until
September before choosing a

. SUCCCSSOT.

“We will be using a very
demanding ‘set of criteri‘a,”A Hesi-
dence said. ‘‘If we can’t find
someone worthy of the position
over the summer, we’ll
because ﬁnding a - good Board
member is our biggest concern.”

This is the second consecutive
year a Board member has resigned
shortly after being elected. Last
year,,Sue Turner resigned and was
replaced by Gary Tweed, who was
reelected this past January.

Sophomore linebacker Al Ches-
ley, heir apparent to a starting
postion on next season’s Pitt
football team, has been suspended
from the squad after being arrested
Tuesday night with another Pitt
student on drug-related charges.

Chesley, 19, of Washington,
D.C., and Mark Williams, 22, of
East Liberty, were arraigned after
city and campus police ofﬁcers

acting on an anonymous tip’

obtained a search warrant and went
to Chesley’s Tower C room shortly
before 6 p.m. I
According to police, Chesley
responded to the officers’ knock by

holding the door and shouting,
“Throw it out the window,” Pitt
officer Gary Moses said he saw a
quantity of suspected cocaine being
thrown from. the window of
Chesley’s fourth‘-ﬂoor room.

Police also said Chesley ran from
the room andiwas apprehended in
the dormitory basement. One
report had Chesley ﬂeeing his room
after picking up a bag of suspected
marijuana, while another ofﬁcer
said Chesley told police he wished
to “get a drink” and ran from the
hallway.

Charges against Chesley in-
cluded three counts of narcotics

Memorial Book Fund

By PETE DICKS‘

A puzzling inﬂux of contributions
to the I-Iostetler-Curry Memorial
Book Fund within the past six weeks
has postponed the termination of
the collection, which began one
week after the Langley Hall
explosion January 20.

The fund will be used to purchase
library books and a book display in
memory of Carleen Curry and
Patricia Hostetler, killed in the
blast.

The collection, which was ex-

SGS To Appoint Editor

By DEANNA LOUISE

‘Applicant interviews for Night
Times editor will begin next week
due to a judicial interpretation of
School of General Studies Student
Cabinet bylaws, which allowed that
body to ﬁll the post despite the
passing of the April 30 deadline.

Alden Bowen, coordinator of the
campus judicial system, told the
cabinet “rule of reason” condones
the appointment.

Student government agent Sue
Thompson said Bowen reasoned

“the bylaws exist so things can be‘

accomplished,” and suggested the
April 30 date be waived under
circumstances which have delaysed
the appointment two months.
During the winter term, Night
Times staffers made time-consum-
ing attempts to establish student
government legislation giving the
paper structural autonomy from the
cabinet.

A strict interpretation of the
bylaws would have left the night
school newspaper without an editor
until next spring.

Three persons, including one
Night Times staffer, have returned
to the cabinet applications for the
vacant position.

Traditionally, the editor is
appointed by the cabinet upon the
recommendation of the retiring
editor.

The cabinet recently rejected
bylaws that would have scrapped

this procedure and established
annual in-house Night Times
elections.

Former Night Times Editor-In-
Cheif Bob Podurgiel, who joined
ranks with News Editor Dan Kohut
last winter and resigned his
position because of alleged cabinet
attempts to determine the paper’s
content, said he is unsure if he will
offer the cabinet his recommenda-
tion of the best qualiﬁed applicant
to ﬁll the post.

“I.don’t know what their intent
is,” Podurgiel said. ‘‘If they are
going to set up a semi-respectable
paper, I’m willing to cooperate.

“But if it’s going to be a public
relations sheet...”

Since the cabinet rebuffed the
newspaper’s bylaws proposals,
' former Editor-In-Chief Joe Wanso-
lich, who testiﬁed at the hearing,
requested the formation of a
joint-committee to study the
paper’s gripes.
“It sounds like a good idea,”
Thompson. said.

Meanwhile, Podurgiel stressed ‘

friction between the two organiza-
tions will continue unless the
paper’s problems are investigated
further.

Contributions Growing

pected to have been completed two
weeks ago, has been bolstered by
donations from campus organiza-
tions, particularly fraternities and
sororities.

Dave Hesidence, the SGB

‘member coordinating the collec-
tion, said, “About three weeks ago I
began the process of shutting down
the fund, but in that time we’ve
received some rather large checks
from some fraternities. What I’d
like to do is let it oontinuefor a
couple of weeks and see if money is
still ﬂowing in. If so, we’ll keep it
going.”

Most of the $739 collected to date
has beenreceived within the past
several weeks.

Hesidence was-surprised at the
relatively small amount of money
collected, despite publicity which
included newspaper articles, ads,

' and letters to organizations de-

scribing the collection. “I was very
disappointed by the total. I
expected a larger response. The
fund was initiated in enough time to
pick up on the sentiment,” he said.
As a result, a new ‘campaign for
funds might be reinstituted next fall
when more students are on campus.

evidence. Found in his room‘ and
on the patio below were a tin foil
containing suspected cocaine, a
quantity of suspected marijuana,
eight capsules, of suspected "dan-
gerous drugs, a smoking pipe and a
one-gram scale.

Chesley and Williams, who was
charged with possession of mari-
juana and tampering with evi-
dence, were released on nominal
bond Tuesday night. Chesley was
accompanied at the arraignment by
attorney Samuel Sciullo and Pitt
head football coach Jackie Sherrill,
who acted “as a concerned parent
would, since the. kid’s folks were in
Washington,” according to one
witness.

Sherrill announced yesterday
that Chesley, whom, former Pitt
coach John Majors said “would be
an All-American before he left
Pitt,” was suspended from the
footballteam “pending completion
of all legal aspects of the case.”

The arrest was Chesley’s fourth
since he came to Pitt on a football
scholarship two years ago.’ On
Nov. 5, 1975 he was arrested by a
city police officer who charged
Chesley' with harrassiing him
during the issuance of a traffic
ticket. Chesley was found guilty in
that case and ﬁned.

Plant Mania in the Green

By PATTY TASCARELLA

The plant boom is a phenomeo
non. Only a few years ago, most
people would be lucky if they could
identify an African violet, let alone
pothos or a Coleus plant. Now
greenhouses from coast to coast are
reporting an alarming increase in
thefts. And even supermarkets are
loading down counters with cacti
and trailing vines.

Plants vary in popularity. Some
people prefer spider plants an
piggy back ‘which, grow new little
plantlets on runners; others opt for
cacti and jade plants because they
need little watering, and some
favor ﬂowering plants like begonias

choice, it seems as if everyone
wants to turn their domain into a
miniature jungle.

Where to buy plants is a problem
for most people. While magazines
urge you to buy from florists or
greenhouses, in all likelihood, the
English ivy that you eye in the
florist’s window and the 50 cent’
special at Woolworth’s were
started from the same parent plant.
The difference is in the advice
you’d receive from the trained pro
and the salesgirl. But you can find

for succulants such as jade plants,
dry out the cutting for a couple of
days before planting (otherwise, it
will rot).

the‘ bad dreams you ever had.
Seen through Nathan’s eyes,
there is the well meaning Julius
Billette (John Pringle) who only
wants the best for his brother with
wife Paula (Trish Beatty) and

daughter Julie (Erin ~Walsh). Julie

provides the unnecessary love
interest with closes out the play.
There is Nathan’s run-in with the
outside world in the persons of Mr

Arthur Schnittler and Dr. Sergei N.
Levetov (both John Pringle), ﬁne
German sons of Adolph and
Sigmund.

Nathan’s sex life ranges from
Apple, a Greek goddess and
anarchist, and Velocity the stew-
ardess, a high ﬂyer, to Space‘
Queen, a terrorist of the sexual
revolution (all played by Penelope
Van Horne).

The. play, conceived and directed
by Bill Royston, is subtitled “a
comedy of romance for the
pleasantly insane. ’ ’ It promises and
delivers just that. What we see
through Nathan’s eyes is not unlike
the exaggerated, terrifying and
humorous world of Woody Allen.

Julie Billette is the only character
who breaks style and unhappily she
sticks out like a photograph in a
gallery of impressionism. She and
the winning of a large amount of
money in an art contest pop the
enjoyable ﬂow of almost slapstick
comedy and attempt to give an
otherwise fantastic world a foothold
in reality it doesn’t deserve.

Blasko--Soccer Part of His Life

By TOM FISHER

. Soccer has been important in the
life of Kim Blasko, a recent Pitt
graduate and member of the Pitt
Panther soccer team.

Blasko became interested in
soccer during his freshman year at
North Hills High School.

“A couple of my older friends
who were juniors at North Hills
were interested in soccer, and I
began to play pick-up games and
practice with them,” said Blasko,
who lettered in soccer in his junior
and senior years.

“Soccer appealed to me because
itwas fast moving, ever changing,
inexpensive to play and easy to
learn and understand,” he con-
tinued. “Soccer allowed me to
improvise in different situations,
but the game was not easy to
play.”

Then it was on to Pitt for a

FENCING TOURNAMENT

and Salle D’Armes de Saurer of
Pleasant Hills will be held at the
Multi-Purpose Room in Trees Hall

until 3 or 4 p.m. Fencers from
Pittsburgh, Carnegie-Mellon, West

“Challenge of the Sexes” mixed
competition.

degree in civil engineering and a
continuation of his soccer. career.

Blasko explained, “I chose to
attend Pitt because the University
had a good engineering depart-
ment and I wanted to stay close to
home.”

Blasko played soccer for four
years and received varsity letters in
his last three, playing at the center
fullback position as a junior and
right fullback as a senior.

“I improved my overall soccer
skills and developed a better
‘game sense,’ which was an
awareness of the events of the
game around me,” said the former
senior co-captain of the soccer
team.

Further proof of Blasko’s self
improvement was his attainment of
all-star status in the Western
Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Soccer
League (an NCAA affiliated divi-
sion to which Pitt belongs) in his
junior year. He narrowly missed
being named as a league all-star for
a second time in his senior year.

Turning his thoughts to the
Panther soccer team, Blasko
offered some insights about’ where

the team stands now and where it
can go in the future. H

In reference to the soccer team’s
1976 record of 4-7-3, Blasko said,
“We played a very good schedule,
which included eight nationally
recognized teams and local power-
houses like Grove City and Slippery
Rock. Although we had a very
good defense, we lacked a scoring
punch.” '

As to the future of the Pitt soccer
team, Blasko said, “Chances for
success are very good. The team
lost only two seniors. They have
the talent to have a good season
this year.”

Blasko offered two suggestions
to bolster the soccer program.

“There is a need for more money
to attract quality high school
players. Pitt is competing against
schools which offer full four-year
scholarships,” Blasko explained.

He also mentioned the need for a
full-time assistant soccer coach
because it is difficult for the head
coach to work with and supervise
30 players at one time.

Blasko next mentioned Coach
Leo Bemis.

“Coach Bemis was a nice man
and very knowledgeable about
soccer. He had a low-key
approach, like Danny Murtaugh,
the late Pittsburgh Pirate manager.
He didn’t get you up for a
game—that was left’ to the

players,” Blasko said.

Soccer still plays a part in his
life. He currently plays soccer in
an amateur/semi-professional
league out of Akron’, Ohio. In the
future, he is open to the possibility
of refereeing soccer games and/or
coaching ayouth team.

One of the most talked about
concert tours in years, Emerson
Lake and Palmer’s 1977 American
tour, will be rolling into the Civic
Arena on June 18.

The show was originally sched-
uled for Three Rivers Stadium, but
due to seating and technical
difficulties it was moved to the
Arena. V

Known for their pioneer fusing of
British rock with great classical
composers, this is Emerson, Lake
and Palmer’s first American tour in
over three years and accompanies
the release of their new album,
“Works Vol. I.”

Accompanying the group will be a
70-piece orchestra and 26 tons of
equipment carried in 14 equipment
trucks. This equipment is needed
for the band to reproduce the
momentous orchestral sound on the
“Works” album.

Pittsburgh-born John Davidson
returns to the city for seven

from Wilkinsburg, is noted for his
semi-regular appearances on TV’s
hit game show, “Hollywood
Squares,” as a frequent guest host
of “The Tonight Show," and as an
occasional co-host of “The Mike
Douglas Show.”
