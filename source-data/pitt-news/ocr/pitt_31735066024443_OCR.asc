Head Lice Infcst

By sue MCFARLAND

Pitt News Staff Writer

The campus-wide panic following
the diagnosis of more than 40 cases
of head lice among residence hall

A students is unwarranted. according

to Dr. Pamela Bowen, of the Stu-
dent Health Service.

Since the discovery of the first
case of head lice Tuesday evening,
the Student Health Service has been
hit with a steady deluge ofmorethan
500 students seeking information
about and examination for the
infestation.

“There really shouldn’t be any
panic,” Bowen said yesterday.
“Today alone, we have seen about
300 people and have diagnosed only
one case.” — '

At this point the outbreak seems
to be “well under control,” Bowen
said.

Although the majority of diag-
nosed cases occurred in residence
hall students, there have been a few
cases diagnosed am‘ong.commuting
students, Bowen said.

There are a number of common
misconceptions surrounding head
lice.

“Head lice don’t only occur
among the lower class sections and
they aren’t a sign ofa lack ofcleanl‘i-
ness,” Bowen said.

“Head lice can be transmitted by

sharing combs, hairbrushes, pillows
or beds,” Bowen said. “Contrary to
some popular myths lice cannot
jump from one person to another.
There must be some direct touching
or sharing of personal articles.”

In response to the tremendous
number of inquiries concerning the
outbreak, the Health Service will

  Do Pre-Exam Courses Really HelpStudent“

By MARY KAN E_
Pitt News Staff Writer.

1

For eight weeks, .lohn—an aspir-

linglaiw student,—listened to tapes,

practiced taking tests, and studied
material atihome. He spent $300, but
he thought taking a preparatory
course ‘was the only way he could

 achieve a high score on-his Law,
7 School Admission Test (LSAT).

Each year, nationwide prepara-

tory testing centers like Stanley’-

Kaplan and Amity offer programs

designed to help students score well-'

on admission tests for colleges, law,
medical. and. graduate schools. But
do these courses really help?

_The answer depends on who you
talk to. Representatives from Stan-
ley, H. Kaplan Educational Center

‘and Amity testing said students who
took their courses scored approxi-
‘mately l0O points above the national
average. ‘ . - ' . ‘

But Joseph Merante, director of
Pitt undergraduate admissions, said
the p'repara'tory courses aren’t really

- a factor in improving test scores.

The ETS (Educational Testing Ser-
vice) ‘say they have not found any
discernable improvement _among
students who took the courses,
according to"Merante.

“Generally speaking, they (the
courses) don’t have a lot to-do with
significantly improving test scores,”
Merante said. “Improvement
depends on many. factors.”

7 Merante added he would ’ not
recommend preparatory courses

.-unless a student is unusually fright-
ened and believes he needs it.

Pitt News Staff Writer

William Robinson is a Demo-
cratic member of City Council run-
ning for a second term of office in
this year‘s Council race. He is chair-
man of the city’s Planning, Housing
and Development Committee.

—PITT NEWS: What do you view
as the main issues of this campaign?

ROBINSON: A very important
issue is lack of cleanliness in the city.
1 think Pittsburgh can be a cleaner
city. I have been advocating for
three years the establishment of a
Clean City Commission, like the one
in Atlanta. It is an effort to bring
together government, business and
community groups to seriously
address our overall ground environ-
ment problems-animal control, lit-
ter control, our lands, our parks,
and our buildings. It would be sup-
ported with government money,
going about cleaning up Pittsburgh
as a government priority. I thinka
clean city is very much in keeping
with the Renaissance.

The next big thing is that I think
we need to work on and work with
the developers to make sure the
Renaissance II, which. will occur
over the next three to four years,
involves local people and local busi-
nesses. The first obligation of City
Council is to the people of Pitts-
burgh. I see no reason to invite
developers and not ask them to
seriously address the concerns of
people who live here: jobs for our
people, business oportunities for our
people, stimulation of our local
businesses. That will make the
Renaissance meaningful for those
who live here and those who will
come.

The third area of concern is to
begin to seriously look at our finan-
cial situation: meaning co-
operation between Council and the

administration to look at the tax
structure in such a way that we don‘t
put any added burden on the wage
earner. I think the average wage
earner has enough burden with all
the wages and fees. I have advocated
an increase in the land tax, which
could have reduced our revenue
burden. -

We have the mechanism in place
and we have enough money in city
government and from taxes not col-
lected to fund the Environmental
Services Commission, and to con-
tinue the loop bus project. The loop
bus is a prime example ofa program
that has provided a direct service

and addresses a major concern in the
city, yet there doesn't seem to be a
committment on the part of govern-
ment to fund the loop bus. I believe
we have the money to fund it. lt’s a
case where we have to reorganize
our priorities.

PITT NEWS: Do you think the
Oakland Plan has a good chance of
being successfully implemented?

ROBINSON: The Oakland Plan
is a bold step at attempting to bring
together diverse interests in a spe-
ciﬁc community; to address very
specific problems and to let everyb-
ody let the other person develop
their own thing. lt’s not easy,
because you're trying to bring
together factions and groups that
have a natural tension between
them. The business community has a
good chance to benefit if develop-
ment is handled in a proper fashion.
In a limited form they have the
capacity to aid community groups
and organizations if they so desire.
The Oakland Plan has a tremendous
potential. There are good people
working for it. It depends on how
much they give and take to serve the
common good. It‘s much better than
the process that has existed in Oak-

to me the university ought to more
fully utilize that office. By using the
PUC_S, Pitt will be doing itself and
the community a great service. The
office is there and can be a valuable
ally to other parts of the city and a
valuable ally to citizen's groups and
organizations.

PITT NEWS: How could the
housing problem in Oakland be
approached by the university?

ROBINSON: I think perhaps the
university needs to address student

housing principally and leave other ’

types of" housing to community
groups and organizations. I-’m con-
cerned when the university goes

beyond area directly related to edu- _

cation. This is perhaps when com-
munity groups‘ become a little
concerned; It probably needs to be a‘
promotor and initiator to get some
sort of local development for hous-
ing of faculty and staff, and not give
community groups and organiza-
tions the feeling they're being run
over, overwhelmed. This could be

handled at the highest levels of the’

university, even if they developed a
University Housing and Develop-
ment Corporation that was separate
from the university but with univer-
sity input to get outside experts in
housing. .
PITT NEWS:

ROBINSON: I’m an advocate of
trying to provide funding to neigh-
borhood groups and organizations
to try to attack environmental prob-
lems. I'm not for government giving
up its responsibility to spend and
administer tax dollars.
Neighborhood problems should
be attacked ona broad, city-wide
level. We have to give neighborhood
groups and organizations the same
courtesy and respect we give devel-
opers and big businesses: to offer a

PITT NEWS: Do you favor Tom
Flaherty‘s proposal to elect Council
seats by district?

ROBINSON: I believe there is no
evidence at this point to suggest at
large or district elections by them-
selves provide better services. The
issue of whether or not we should
change the system should be depoli-
ticized. The issue should be raised in

a nonelection year so no one voting -

should follow the advice of Lewis
Mason who said, ‘What’s the rush?’

Although Bowen said it is not

some basic guidelines to students:

—lf a student has had direct con-

The outbreak of head lice has
caused no major curtailment of cam-

the Greek Blood Drive which was
cancelled because ofthe outbreak of
lice.

—Those persons exposed to diag-

yourself," Hyatt said. “They expose
you to time pressure, and get you
used to the idea of taking standard-
ized tests."

Hyatt said a student could get as
much value for the money he spends
on a preparatory course by using it
to apply to more schools.

“l’m not saying they (the courses)
don’t work,” Hyatt said. “But the
results can be achieved in other
areas. Preparatory courses are not
the only secret to success. its one
way. They don’t work for everyone.
They work forfsome.”

Kaplan courses for the LSAT
consist of eight four-hour sessions,
with taped lectures and take-home
.material included.

“This is not a cram course,"
Kaplan said. “Cram courses can’t
often help. But long courses can be
an educational experience. If you
practice and work, you will increase
your score.” ’

The cost for the Kaplan LSAT
course is $300. An Amity course for
the LSAT is administered during

' one weekend and costs $160.

Incest is taboo. Yet sexual abuse
of children continues to plague
society significantly.

One out of every five women and
one out of every 11 men has been
sexually abused by the time they
reach age 18, according to a national
study of college students.

“One third of the 540 sexual
assaults reported to Pittsburgh
Action Against Rape (PAAR)'in
1980 were children under the age of
18,” said Rhoda Mills Sommer,
child services coordinator ofPAAR,
a non-proﬁt organization.

However, researchers unanim-
ously agree that the reported inci-
dence of interfamilial child sexual

abuse (incest) represents but the tip
of the iceberg, Sommer added.

Juvenile Court Judge Patrick R.
Tamilia commented that the most
prominent form of incest occurs
between the father and daughter.

“Incest is very often part of the
particular family culture,” Tamilia
said. “We see girls who have been
sexually abused since the time they
were five or six years of age.”

Sommer said the average age in
which a child is first sexually abused
is between five and 14 years old, and
the incidents of abuse continue for
an average of eight years.

Part of the problem is that child-
ren are in many ways taught to be
victims.

“They don’t know that there‘s a
difference between good touches

The Pitt News, Friday,‘ Mafrchp, 1931

and bad touches," Sommer said, “or
that they have a right to their own
bodies.

“The child feels betrayed, power-
less and distrustful of others’ inten-
tions. She may feel that because it
has gone on for so long and since she
hasn’t told anyone, she is to blame.
That feeling of powerlessness is very
important. lt’s something the child
will carry for the rest of her life.”

Tramilia stated that the major
stumbling block-in the way ofprose-
cution is the enormous pressure put
on the child.

"‘The child starts to feel guilty,
that she's breaking up the family,”
he said. “The father will promise to
get counseling or to stop drinking.
He’ll promise anything.

“I was discussing this with District

Attorney Colville and the presiding
Judge of Criminal Court, Judge
Dauer who said that in his judicial
career of seven or eight years, he has
only had two cases of incest.”

“The reason that the cases don’t
reach him in Criminal Court is
because by the time the police get
involved and the prosecution is
started, the child has either recanted
or the evidence breaks down and the
case never gets into court.”

“It takes a minimum of a year to
work through the ordeal if you're
successful,” Tramilia said. “lfyou’re
not successful, it comes to the point
that the child must be removed or
the father must be kept out of the
house.”

“lt’s an ongoing process. We
review the cases, we talk to counse-

lors, we get the family back in court
every three or four months to see
what’s going on. Many of them, we
do get back together with some assu-
rance that this is not going to be
repeated."

Sommer said that the actions ofa
father who sexually abuses his child
is many times his reaction to the
high-level stress of today’s society.

“The threat of intimacy is the fear
of being rejected,” she said. “The
father feels that with his own child,
he’s not going to be rejected.

every 11 men has been
sexualls abused by the‘
time they reach '18, ac-:
cording to a national
study of college stu-
dents

“He feels inept at negotiating
interpersonal relationshilps, does
not have skills in caring and sharing
emotionally with others and focuses
only on his needs and feelings. He is
a psychological child in the physical
guise of an adult," she said.

An inter-agency task force dealing
with rape, has developed a subcom-
mittee on child sexual assault, _
Sommer said. “Our agency and a
number of other agencies including
Children's Hospital, the police and
Judge Tramilia are attempting to
coordinate services that will be
offered to children and to let people
know that we’re available.”

Tramilia explained that he’s mov-
ing towards the emphasis of counsel-
ing because of the difficulty in
prosecuting child abusers. Even if
the child abuser does go to jail,
which is usually only for one year to

18 months, the interactional prob-

lem has not been solved,‘ and so the .

child is still in danger.

“We can probably be much more
effective and do better for the child
as well as society in resolving this
problem by using this technique of
counseling and monitoring the
[situation than we can by simply
‘treating it as a criminal problem and
putting people in jail,” -Tramilia
said. ' '

A basic step to over-

has served to keep

-to prevent it and treat

PAAR offers free child, indiviual, T

family and group therapy. _

“I believe that one ofthe purposes
of therapy is toteach people how to
meet' their needs in healthy ways,”

Sommer said. “Play therapy is avery '

natural healing for children and a
very important way for a child to
work things out.”

A counseling group for women

who were sexually abused children
will beginatthe end ofthis month or
early April. A

SGB

Budget Hearings
The nine members of the SGB
Allocations Committee are now
busy four nights a week reviewing
budget requests and making initial
preparations for the budget hearings

that begin in three weeks.
According to committee member
Kris Messner, a total of $350,000
will be allocated next year to the
SGB committees, seven major gov-

ernance groups (Resident Student «

Association, Interfraternity Coun-
cil, Interhonorary Council, Panhel-
lenic, Black Action Society, Student
Nursing Organization, and Engi-
neering Society), and 80 student
organizations.

After reviewing each budget
request and interviewing group
representatives separately, the Allo-
cations Committee will submit its
recommendations to SGB. 1

Committee member James Shel-
ton reported that things are running
smoothly and, on schedule for the
budget hearings set for March 23,
April 6, and April I0.

. Carpool Program

The SGB Commuter Affairs
Committee is putting together a car-
pool program for next fall to alle-
viate problems that face commuters
because of the closing of the Park-
way and the increasing price of
gasoline.

...an increase of even
one-half to one percent
could mean ’ an
additional $3 million.’

 
The committee has received a
great deal of assistance and informa-

_ tion from the Federal Department

of Transportation and its “Share-A-
Ride“ program, said committee bus-
iness manager Peter Karlovich.

According to Karlovich, 30,000
commuting students will be mailed
an optical scan sheet (similar to a
computer answer sheet) sometime in
August. They will be asked to fill it
out and return it within a three week
deadline. Students will then be
matched up with other students liv-
ing within a given radius of them and
a list with this information will be
sent to them.

“This will definitely be an annual
thing," Karlovich said. “If it is very
successful, it may be possible to run
it twice a year, both fall and winter
terms.”

The Commuter Affairs Commit-
tee has also submitted a request ask-
ing that the university-owned
parking lots near Trees Hall and
Panther Hollow offer a reduced rate
for a carpool of three or more
students.

The way Pennsylvania trains its
teachers ‘may soon undergo drastic
changes if State Education Secre-
tary Robert Scanlon has his way.

A spokesman for the Department
of Education yesterday said the
proposals by Scanlonwill call for
the following:

Development of a teachers act,
making teaching a profession the
same as law or medicine. “Pro-
fessionalized education,” the
spokesman called it.

Development of a “profes-

Placement of “rigorous admis-
sion standards" for those enter-
ing all levels of educational
training.

Development of a licensing
program “around the needs of
the human being as opposed to
the organizational structure of '
the schools.”

Providing an “induction year”

would “assist teachers in adjust-
ing.” Also under this heading,-
would fall a program for “eva-
luating the individual”
periodically. -

Development of a “licensing
board controlled by the profes-
sion.” This is a very controversial
area the spokesman said. I ’

The changes, if passed, would not
affect teachers now practicing, the
spokesman said.

Several reasons were cited for the

proposals, including the need for
improvement of school personnel to

go along with improvements in the 

schools themselves; the need for bet-

ter utilization of recent “technologi- 

cal developments in education”; and,

the need for “periodic examina-"sf
tions” to see if schools are “serving 

the needs of the society.”

Public hearings will be held on the I 
proposals in April and May‘, and 
modifications will be made if 

needed, the spokesman said.

The days of the V-8 engine, pro-
duction line limousines, and 20-
cents-a-barrel crude oil have gone
the antiquated way of the horse and
buggy, said Paul Hammond, co-
director of the University of Pitts-
burgh’s Energy and .Environment
Center, umbrella organization for
Pitt’s Energy Policy Institute.

“Those days are gone forever,” he
said, referring to cheap oil prices.
And oil prices will continue to rise at
a higher rate.

There are disputes about how
rapidly energy prices will increase,
but they will continue to increase,”
Hammond said. i

mond, is due to the four—fold
increases OPEC imposed in 1973
and their doubling since. It is also
due to inconsistent economic poli-

cies of the Reagan administration, .

he added.

“It has taken the price controls off
oil and may hurry up the decontrol
of natural gas, which is a way of
letting market price increase the
demand for higher priced supplies,”
he said.

“On one hand they are saying let's
do less to push synthetic fuels into
the market. On the other hand, let’s
let the price of energy go up and
advance to induce private invest-
ments to increase supply," he added.

His solution may involve govern-
ment intervention to hold pump pri-

ces to a minimal level, should
economic conditions warrant.
“There are a couple ofthings that
the U.S. government might do. One
is to, in effect, increase subsidies or
the protection of gasoline prices so
we pay at the pump less than the
market price. A

“It simply means the government
absorbs the cost,” Hammond said.

The Energy and Environment
Center was established two years
ago by the chancellor “in an attempt
to be responsive to the growing con-
cerns with energy and the intersec-
tion between the environmental
concerns and energy problems,”
Hammond said.

“The role of the center has been to
seek funding for research, and

   

oak éknofs.

 

The Pitt News, Friday, March 6, 1981

Cheap Oil Prices: Gone Forever?

mainly through government sour-
ces. We have been able to generate
research funding," he added.

The center has assisted professors
in the engineering, chemistry and
economic departments in obtaining
funds in energy—related areas.

The center has a small budget and
acts as a broker between govern-
ment and various departments ofthe
university.

It is not a think tank, Hammond
maintained, looking back to his pre-
vious employment with the Rand
Corporation. A think tank situation
would lead to undesirable conse-
quences within the university.

“lfwe were to sell out a think tank
and hire people directly if they were
faculty members, we wouldibe in
competition with the deans and
other claimants of university fund-
ing," he said.

The Reagan energy solution,
according to Hammond, is to pre-
vail within the United States over
foreign sources economically. This

' solution will mean higher energy

prices.

“We will become more‘independ-
ent of foreign oil and other energy
sources quicker if we pay, within the
country, the international market
price for energy,” he ‘said.

Developing nations will find diffi-
culty meeting the current interna-
tional market price, and that fact
will slow economic development.
The United States, Western Europe

and Japan have absorbed the price
increases, Hammond added.

He concluded that the oil com-
panies will find the going difficult as
a result” of antipathy and suspicion
by the American public, inflamed by
higher oil prices, but said that the
problem is similar to the problem of

drilling dry wells. They cannot

expect much sympathy, he said.

“The oil companies are competent
and not weak. They have to live in a
world of opinion. Public opinion
has an effect on policy,” Hammond
said.

“They ought to be able to cope
with that problem," he added.

One result of that public outcry
has been Congress‘ willingness to
institute windfall proﬁts taxes,
which is strongly political, he said.

“It doubtless stems from some
populist attitudes in this country
that are hostile or suspicious of the
oil companies,” he added.

Another manifestation of public
suspicion has been grumbling over
oil company investments in uranium
and coal. There is the possibility that
the companies may withhold oil
supplies, Hammond said.

“One can be sympathetic with
their notions that they want to con-
tinue to be in the business of supply-
ing energy, decades ahead. But -in
doing that, they arouse two suspi-
cions. One is that they want to with-
hold supply, and that they want to
corner the market,” he said. I

On the brink of the U.S. proposal to step up eco-

nomic aid to the El Salvadoran “civilian”junta, the .

Social Democrats of some Latin American nations
have offered their services to act as mediators between
the governments and the Democratic Revolutionary
Front. —

During the Carter Administration, the U .S. pledged
limited involvement in El Salvador. But as the slau"gh-
ter continued in that country, the former president
must have seen a need to intervene. Perhaps it became
apparent that the poorly organized Salvadoran
government would collapse, without being shouldered
by a superpower. By the time Carter left office, El
Salvador was receiving more economic, as well as
military assistance. . _

The United States’ role, or the impression of their

be addressed through collective bar-
gaining, which will‘ enable the
faculty to begin to recover its lost
sense of community of purpose and
action.

The university expanded rapidly
in the 50s and 60s, and disciplines
and subdisciplines became increas-
ingly specialized. As a result, com"-
munication across departmental
lines became more difficult, despite
energetic efforts by many at interdis-
ciplinary research and teaching.

But these factors would have haldl

less impact institutionally, had it not ’

been for theeffects of economic hard
times in the 70s. When resources
became scarce,’ competition among
different parts ofthe university, and

among individuals, began to over- ,

shadow efforts at cooperation.

The administration deplored the
effects of inflation and inadequate
appropriations, and it did attempt to

combat them. But at the same time,_ _

it took advantage of the weakened
position of faculty in the academic

emphasized teaching, between Oak-
land and the regional campuses,
between the natural sciences, social
sciences and humanities, between
departments, and on and on.

There are inclusive faculty bodies

_which might have tempered these

divisive trends—the University
Senate, the faculty councils, and so
on. But‘all too often these were

unable to counter the advantages of
the administration, with its secret
budgetary processes and claims of
ultimate authority in all areas of uni-
versity policy and practice. Most
faculty gradually stopped attending
senate and other meetings, with-

finessed or simply ignored by the
administration, and often has been.

The best way for the faculty to
'overcome the fragmentation, disaf-
fection and powerlessness just des-
cribedis through the achievement of
collective bargaining. Bargaining
restructures the relationship
between faculty and administration
in a way that gives the faculty real
legal status, and an appropriate

’ degree. of power to defend its collec-

tive interests and to participate
effectively ‘ in the university's
decision-making processes. It would
strengthen the Senate and other
organs ofgovernance by givingthem
contractually recognized functions
and powers. It would give the faculty
greater access to budgetary informa-
tion in a comprehensive, rather than
piecemeal, fashion.

-declined, insisting that the negotiations take place

U.S. priorities seem confused at this point. While
the opportunity arose to reduce the conﬂict to a peace-

to increase the junta’s ammunition. -

countries intervene, to_whom will they talk? Although
the U.S. has begged off on mediated involvement, it
seems that they have all but let the conﬂict be a direct
one. They refused an opportunity to negotiate the
peace, but they felt it was their place toload the junta
with military hardware to escalate the murder.

The Democratic Revolutionary Front has every

' right to request negotiations to take place with the’
United States. The crumbling, economy of Duarte’s

country would indeed have collapsed if the U.S."hadn’t
risen to the task of bailing them out. The Revolution-
aries want to handle the problems of the country with
their true opposition, and that is the United States and
their aid. ’

The U.S. has acted as mediator to the El Salvadoran
conﬂict. Unfortunately, their mediation has been one
that only increased the violence in that country.

the Social Democrats, then it would become increas-

‘And That’s The W ay It W as’

By LARRY LU NSFORD

There is a bit of history that is
going to take place tonight that not
only will be emotional for those ofus
in the media business but to all lay-
men alike. Walter Cronkite gives his
final newscast as anchorman of the
“CBS Evening News” tonight.

Walter Cronkite has already
joined such journalism greats as
Ernie Pyle and Walter Lippman in

as though the
reporters were

attempting to make
history rather than
report it.

the annals recognizing the true pro-
fessionals in the field. The 63-year-
old newsman has dedicated himself
to five decades of researching, ana-
lyzing, investigating, and reporting
the intricacies so vital to the media.

Not only is he one of the most

g.;espected newsmen among his col-

leagues, but Walter has been named
by pollsters as the most trusted per-
son in the country for many consec-
utive years. At a time when those in
the news media are giving politicians
a run for the lowest position of
respect in the country, it is indeed a
tribute to a person of the former
profession to receive such an annual

ihonon

'(
l

We are the first to admit that the
journalism profes_sion could use a
little housecleaning right now. Not
since the days of yellow journalism
has public opinion been so tainted
against the media. The exposes dur-
ing the Watergate era by the
Washington Post brought laurels to
the business for several years, but

C ollective-Bargaining

The bargaining organization
itself, whether the Pitt Professional
Union or a United Faculty coalition,
would represent allthe faculty in the

Q;-.provost‘s area bargaining unit. It

would continue to be democratically
organized and run. lt would provide
assurance of due process and an
effective grievance .procedure for

the intense competition that fol-

lowed has seen not only the print.
.medium but the broadcast medium

as well stoop toilevels not known
since the muckraking days of old.

Getting the scoop first has always
been the key to success among media
'rivals;'yet, recently such jumps on a
scoop have led to the premature
reporting of news on events that
never occurred, and red-faced repor-
ters attempt to make amends for the
errors on the air or in print. The
fiasco at the Republican National
Convention last summer comes to
mind. The scramble there among the‘
reporters to learn first who would be
the vice presidential nominee was
hideous and outright embarrassing
for the profession. At times it
seemed as though the reporters were
-attempting to make history rather
than report it. The hostage crisis
gavethe media anotherchancetoact
irresponsibly, and unfortunately
many members did. especially in
dealing with -the families of the
hostages.

This, however, is not intended to
be a lament for the media, but it is

nice to know. that_even in less pros- ‘

pe_rous times for the profession,
there is still a person there who
represents the best the.business has
to offer. Walter Cronkite worked
diligently for many years to reach
the apex of achievement. His zeal
and his integrity are reﬂected in his
style of reporting. He does a tho-.
rough job in his work, and even
when the highly conservative nature
of the CBS Network tempered the
newsman’s remarks, Walter was
powerful enough to protect hisjour-

'nalistic rights and report the news as

he saw it.

During the hostage crisis, Cron-
kite was chided by some critics for
continuing to- close his ,, newscast
each day by givingthe number ofthe

' day that the hostages had been held

captive in lran. The veteran news-
man recognized thetimmense news
value of the event and the potential

every individual, with the final step
being impartial arbitration, not an
administration decision. 2

Achieving collective‘ bargaining
would not re-establish a community

of scholars at Pitt overnight, of

‘course. But it would offerthe faculty

a real chance to regain its sense of"

sharing common interests and goals,

crisis that each day’s captivity held
for the world situation. That is why
he reminded us daily that the con-
tinued captivity was a major world-
wide news event. ,

Last summer, New Republic mag-
azine reported that Cronkite would

be honored to accept the vice presi- '
dential position on John Anderson's ‘

independent presidential ticket.
Even though he didn’t deny the mag-
azine report, Cronkite announced
that he wasn’t interested in running
for political office. There were many
of us at the time who hoped that he
would seriously consider the
possibility.

Cronkite said in an interview with
Parade magazine last year that-he
looked forward to relinquishing the
CBS position so that he could begin
to voice his opinions. publicly on
national and international affairs-
a freedom he hasn’t been allowed by
CBS officials. We look forward to
hearing the personal versus the pro-

fessional views of the man so dedi— _

Eastern 8 Final Four “to Battle at Civic Arena?

Pitt Opens vs

Rhode Island

By MIKE DICHIARA

Pitt News Sports Writer
“If he has to come out on crutches,

he’ll start,” said Pitt coach Roy

Chipman about Sam Clancy's injury
condition for tonight’s semi-ﬁnal
matchup between the Pitt Panthers
(16-1 1) and the Rhode Island Rams
(21-6) at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena.

Pitt has been playing well the last
month’ and a half, according to
Chipman, and the main key is
Clancy. Ever since an ankle injury
during the Massachusetts’ game two
weeks ago, Clancy has continued
playing, although not being 100 per-
cent healthy. ,

Pitt’s other key injury is to Paul
Brozovich. He twisted an ankle
against West Virginia two and a half
weeks ago at the Field House and sat
out the next game against
Massachusetts.

“Right now, we’ll be starting Bro-
zovich at center, Clancy and (Len-
nie) McMillian at forward, and
(Carlton) Neverson and (Dwayne)
Wallace at guard," said Chipman.
“The only possible change to that
would be if Brozovich re-hurt him-
self during practice or just couldn’t
run well. Then (Steve) Beatty would
start.”

Rhode lsland's starting five,
according to assistant coach Claude
English will be Jimmy Wright and

‘Marc Upshaw at forward, Horace
“Pappy” Owens and Phil Kydd at
guard, and Roland Houston at
center.

In the one previous meeting ofthe
two teams, Pitt lost to Rhode lsland
62-60 when the Rams’ Kevin Comp-
ton sank two free throws with one
second remaining in the game. The
Panthers at one point owned a 10-
point lead before being outscored by
the Rams 19-7 down the stretch.

Rhode Island got to the semi-
finals by beating a stubborn Massa-

' chusetts team 53-48 in Amherst,
Mass. Pitt defeated Rutgers at the
Field House 67-62 to propel them
into the contest.

The Panthers have two ofthe top

10 scorers in the Eastern Eight this
season. Clancy, who finished third,
and Neverson in seventh place, are
averaging 16.4 and 15.2 points per
game, respectively. The Rams have
three players in the top 20 in Wright,
Upshaw and Owens. They have
averaged 15.2, 13.7, and 12.7 points
per game respectively.

The key for Pitt will be to stop the ‘

scoring combination of Owens,
Wright and Upshaw. In the first
game, Upshaw led the Rams with 20
points, Owens had 14 and Wright
had 10. Wright was also dominant

- V under the boards with 10 rebounds.

The Rams are also a big team.
Wright and Houston stand 6-foot-8,
and Upshaw is 6‘-foot-6.9

Both Wright and Upshaw finished
among the top 10 rebounders in the
conference.

The Rams‘ objectives will be to
shut down the recent production
from Pitt’s guard position. Both
Wallace and Neverson have been
scoring points by the bushel over the
last three weeks of the season, and
that has been. a spark for the
Panthers.

In addition, Clancy, Brozovich
and Beatty will be under pressure to

    

 

second remaining.
Things to look for:

Pitt vs Rhode Island
TIPOFF : 7:00 p.m., March 6, 1981 at the Civic Arena

LAST MEETING: Pitt lost in the closing seconds as they couldn’t hit a basket
in the last three minutes and missed their last six foul shots. Rhode Island won
the gams 62-60, when freshman Kevin’ Compton hittwo free throws with one

Pitts Sam Clancy’s ankle will have to allow him to play
adequately and a 16 point, 12 rebound preformance like he had against Rutgers
would not hurt. The panthers live and die by their 1-3-1 zone and it will have to
neutralize RI superheight. Look for Chipman to go early to his bench if things
aren’t going well as he did against Rutgers.
RI will have to handle the crowd which should be a sellout. Rhode lsland’s

“Tiger” Paul Auslander’s gets the

Eastern Eight’s number.

When summer comes to Pitts-
burgh, long after the Pitt basketball
season has ended, Tiger Paul Aus-
lander packs his bags and heads for
the neon lightslof the Las Vegas
strip. And of course, the casinos.

Two summers ago, Auslander

Cortez, a casino which specializes in
taking bets on sporting events.

“I used to keep the scored and
pitching changes posted inning by
inning, or 1 would announce when
somebody hit a home run, or wha-
tever;" Auslander said. “l’d root
while 1 did it, and pretty soon there
were crowds gathering just to watch
me.” .

But Auslander is better known to
the sports crowds of Pittsburgh for
his nine-year tenure as Pitt’s most
visible cheerleader for the Panther

Tiger Paul predicts he’ll be up to his old tricks at the Eastern 8 tournament this weekend.

‘Tiger’ Paul Predicts Eastern 8.

' is the source ofthe following predic-

ti'ons about the outcome of tonight
and tomorrow’s Eastern 8 Playoff
action at the Civic Arena. The
winner will be the Eastern 8's repre-
sentative at_ the upcoming 1981
NCAA championship tournament.

Before he got into the predictions-

about the Pitt-Rhode‘-lsland and
Duquesne-West Virginia semi—fmal
match ups, Auslander’ had a grain of
wisdom for all the prospective

.:.gamblers hinging their wagers on his

esteemed advice. -
“I'm probably the last person
you’d want to ask about this," Aus-
lander said, laughing. “If the people
are really worried about their
money, l’d advise them to re_ad what

1 said and choose the other team. '

But, l’1l try.”
Here’s how

shapes up. ,
Pitt—Rhode lsland: “The key -to

the game will be if Pitt plays as well

the tournament

as they can. _If they don't, thenl

expect them to get beat- by Rhode
Island,” Auslander said. The Panth-
ers will need a total team effort
against the taller Rhode, Island

squad, who enter the ematchuplévithja =

 

21-6 record and a share of the East.-
er_n 8 regular season championship.

Auslander doesn’t count Pitt out of _

the game, despite the Ram’s impres-
sive credentials.

_ .“Rhode Island had a tough time in
their opening playoff_ game against
Massachusetts, which is a veryrweak
team. 1’give Pitt the edge because of
that. We can win it but it will be a
tough game,” Auslander said. A

Auslander likened this year’s
game with Pitt’s semi-final encoun-
ter with a‘ strong V/illanova team in
the 1978 Eastern 8 tournament.

“Pitt ‘played very well against Vil-
lariova in that game and still lost by
two. This game should be another
close one," Auslander predicted.

Duquesne-—West Virginia:' “On

« paper, 1 favored Duquesne to take

the championship before the tourna-
ment started," Auslander said.
“Even though they had a hard time
defeating George Washington in the
first round, 1 think the Dukes will
beat West Virginia.'’' » C
“West Virginia has had. injury
problems, also. The loss_ of (Greg)

Nance takes away from their team.”

Dukes Face
Tough WVU

‘By MIKE DICHIARA g
Pill News.Sports Writer

1n the second game of tonight’s
tournament doubleheader, the
Duquesne Dukes'(l9-8) will meet
the West Virginia Mountaineers (20-
7) at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena in
the Eastern Eight semi-finals.

The Mountaineers ahd Dukes
splitthe season series one game each
this year. West Virginia won the first
meeting 73-61 in Morgantown back

in January. They had four players in V

double figures for scoring, led by
Russel Todd with 15, Greg Jones
and Diego McCoy with l4‘each, and
Quentin Freemanwith 1 1.

West Virginia totally dominated
the" game. They out-rebounded
Duquesne 37-29, outshot Duquesne

- 58-47 percent and had more assists,

18-9. The only bright spot for the
Dukes was Ronnie Dixon who had
27 points to lead all scorers.

The re-match at the"Civic Arena a
month later was a different story.
Duquesne won 69-64 in a very physi-
cal battle under the boards.
Duquesne won the rebounding war,
led by Bruce Atkins with 21. He
battled with West Virginia’s Phil

Collins who had 15 rebounds. Thea

Dukes outshot’ the Mountaineers
48-33 percent from the floor and had

.more assists, 18-9. »

“We’re not a healthy basketball
team right now,” said West_Virginia
coach Gale Catlett. “We also haven't

' played well lately. We had a lot of

trouble with (St.).Bonaventure at
home.” 6

. Jones is the _main question mark
in the Mountaineer lineup. Accord-
ing to Catlett, he is only playing at

about 70 percent capacity but will 53*

in the 1i_neup..Jones is the league’s
fourth leading scorer with'_an aver-
age of 15.8 points per game. He also
led the league in assists withan aver-

g age of 4.5 per game.

In addition to Jones, Todd is aver-
aging l 1.4 points per game, which is
good for 20th in the league.

Duquesne’s leading scorer is Ron-_
nie Dixon with a 17.3 average, which

is seco‘nd only to Earl Belcher ofSt-. J

Bonaventure for the conference

. lead. Bruce Atkins is.'averaging..L5:5

points per.gam_e to_ ranksixth and
John Moore is 13th with a 140
average. ' ’

“Moore wasikicked in ,the let?‘

against GW,” said coach Mike Rice.
“It started to hemorrage and’ he
wasn’t_ab1e to practice. But it’s the.
same as for Clancy, he will play no
matter what.” A ’

Atkins. is the tower of strength
under the boards for the Dukes. He
led the conference with 12 rebounds .
per game and also in field ‘goal per-
centage with 59 percent. '

The big advantage that the Dukes
have is the home court advantage.

“If we had to play at the F1

could win," said, Rice. (“But at the

‘As the Pitt Pantherettes head into
the first round of action in the East-
ern Regional Women’s Basketball
Championship, a career is coming to
a close for a highly successful guard
named Lori Dolby. The 5-foot-6
senior from Clarion has played an
important part in Pitt’s stellar cam-
paign, solidifying the Pantherette
attack in several areas.

Dolby, a transfer student from

.9..Edinboro State, stepped’ into the

starting line-up for first-year coach
Judy Saurer with all the necessary
credentials. Last year, at Edinboro
the sharp-shooter rippedithe nets for
552 points, placing her fourth in
Mid-Atlantic Conference scoring
with an 18.4 average.'This year,
Dolby is averaging 10.9 points a
game for the Pantherettes.

“At Edinboro, we didn’t have an
inside game like we do down here,”
explains Dolby. “I don’t have to
shoot the ball as much at Pitt as 1 did
at Edinboro.”

Although the’Dolby isn’t shooting
as much, her shots are_ sinking at a
much higher success rate despite the
stiffer opposition she plays against

?"with Pitt. Dolby is hitting at a .476

clip for the Pantherettes this year,
compared to a .415 clip for Edin-
boro last season. In her career, the
master of the outside shot has

dumped in 1,420 markers for a
career average of 13.5 tallies a
contest.

“Lori has a very quick release,
which is a tremendous asset to her
shooting,” said Saurer. “She is our
zone breaker, because she can sink

the outside shot with consistency-

and her quickness allows her to get

5/, open.”

An excellent all-around athlete,
Dolby lettered in track and volley-
ball as_ well as basketball at Clarion
Area High School. Dolby was also
honored as team MVP in all three
sports. However, the modest guard
insisted that she was not a star in
high school.

“Coach, Saurer made me the
player 1 am today,” stressed Dolby.
“She is a practice coach, using the
time to prepare us well for each

\game and to work on each._player’s

'~’/ivyeaknesses."

Saurer, who also coached Dolby
at Edinboro, claims that one of Dol-
by’s greatest attributes is her con-
stantdrivefor perfection. '

“Lori is her hardest critic. She’s
extremely tough on herself, and she
turns around and; works hard to
improve the area where she feels she
is weak.” Saurer goes on to explain
further, “There was a time when l
wsa uncomfortable with Lori hang
dling the ball. Now, 1 relax while
she's dribbling because she has
worked so hard and improved her
bal1—hand1ing so much that 1 feel
confident sheacan handle it."

Although most of Dolby’s success
is credited to her offensive explo-'
siveness, one cannot ignore her def-
ensive prowess. Her quick hands
and “game instinct” allow Dolby to
play a zone defense or a man-to-man
with equal intensity and a great deal

'_ of effectiveness. Perhaps the most

amazing statistic in Dolby’s defen-
sive game is the fact that she did not
foul out of a game all year.

The key to Dolby’s success at Pitt
can be traced to her ability to adjust.

According‘ to Saurer, Dolby’s'
adjustments encompassed four mam

areas.

“First ofall, changing schools and
teams in your senior year calls for a
lotjof sacrifice.‘ Lori had to make.a
personal adjustment, leaving friends
and teammates at Edinboro and
coming to Pitt.”

Dolby, once at Pitt, had to try and
fit into theteam. She had to adjust to
a different style of play, brought
about by the type of personnel on
the squad. Finally, Dolby had to
accept the fact that she was not the
premier scorer at Pitt as she ‘had
been at Edinboro.- '

“A lot of players wouldn't make
the switch from being the big fish in
a little pond to being a little fish in a
big pond like Lori did,” says Saurer.
“I admire her for making that.kind,
of sacrifice."

“l likeibeing on a team where eve-
ryone contributes in their own way,”
said Dolby, a studio arts major. “It
was hard to change, but it was a
welcome change. It feels good to win”
a game with a-total team effort."

Lori Dolbyiis a first-rate example i

of the success that can be reaped ’
through hard work and self-

sacrifice. The move Dolby made

from Edinboro to Pitt is like moving
from the minor leagues to theimajor
leagues, and if you make it in the
major leagues, you are one of the
select few.~ Lori Dolby made the
move, improved her game, and now

stands as one of those select few.

itt Overcomes Errors ;Downs Eas

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
Pitt News Sports Editor

After the match between the Pitt
Panthers and East Stroudsburg
Wednesday night, the two opposing
coaches met at mid-court, looked at
each other and just shook their
heads.

“That was .a lot of garbage,“ said
Pitt head coach Ray Reilly.

“We had more garbage than you
did,” said East Stroudsburg coach
Bob Sweeney -

In a contest littered with sloppy
play and lackadaisical performance,
Pitt emerged from the league match
with a win,’ l5—l, l5—ll, l4—l6,
l6—l4, mainly because East
Stroudburg was better at playing
poorly than the Panthers were.

The quality of the match was sur-
prising. Going into the match, Reilly
anticipated a stiff test from East
Stroudsburg, which entered the con-
test with a 7—2 record. The Panth-
ers ( 1 1-7) were coming offa 10-day
layoff to face a team that Reilly feels
will challenge Pitt’s attempt to
repeat its third-ranking this year in
the Eastern Collegiate Volleyball
League. .

The layoff, plus the recent lack of
practice time of Panther setter Dave
Baird, the quarterback of the Pitt
offensive attack, hampered the
team’s passing and timing, said
Reilly. Baird missed the last 10 days
of practice with a strep throat, and
practiced only one day with the team

before the match. Timing is crucial"

to the varied offense Pitt runs, espe-
cially between the setter and hitter.

“Our timing was atrocious,” said
Reilly. “It had to be the worst it’s
been this year. Our offense just
didn’t work consistently. There’s no
doubt the layoff hurt us.”

Panthers were able to overcome mistakes and spike East Strousburg into submission Wednesday night

V The Panthers started the match in
good form, roaring past East
Stroudsburg l5—~l in the first game.
Pitt worked its spiking attack and
blocking virtually at will as East
Stroudsburg suffered from an array
of unforced errors. The failure to
execute well in the basic fundamen-
tals, like passing, prevented East

Stroudsburg from mustering any
offensive attack.

Although East Stroudsburg had
to drive sixvhours to reach Pitts-
burgh, Sweeney said the trip wasn’t
an excuse for his team's sluggish
brand of play.

“We just weren't ourselves’

tonight,” said Sweeney. ‘‘We’re nor-
mally quick offensively and defen-
sively, but we didn’t play like the
team we have.” *

“They lulled us to sleep in that"

first game. We came out really fired
up and I expected a tough first game
from them,” said Reilly. “They were
just flat and it rubbed off on us. We
began standing around too.”

East Stroudsburg finally came to

life in the third game and struggled _

to win- it l6—l4, as the Panthers

took their turn to make the mis-e

takes. Neither team seemed intent

 

on winning thegame, as the score
stayed deadlocked at l4—l4for sev-
eral exchanges of ~ service. East
Stroudsburg, faced with the match
loss, finally took charge, to win the
game and prolong the match.

Despite all the “garbage", Reilly
won’t refuse the win. But for East
Stroudsburg, losing the match
makes its poor quality of play even
harder to swallow.

It should be relays, and more
relays for the Pitt men, lucky enough
to have made the IC4A’S indoor
track championships to be held at
Princeton University this weekend.
The bulk of,the panthers will be
competing in the one and two mile
relays. Larry Kinney is the only non-
relay participant and he has quali-
fied for the triple jump.

The two mile relay teams consist
of Todd Colas, Joel Albers, Terry
Gallagher, and Conover. Coach
Mike Agostinella is confident that
the two mile relay team should do
extremely well and feels that they
stand a good shot at winning.

is not expected to do as well. Agosti-
nella feels that this team should
place but was hesitant in predicting a
win.

Larry Kinney stands a good
chance at victory. Already having
tripledjumped 50"7 (third best in the
East) Kinney if anything should
place high.

The Pitt track team is not relay
oriented because many of the relay
participant have qualified for other
events. Joyner, a sophomore quali-
fied for the 600 meters but it is on
AgostineIla’s orders that the running
will be limited to relays.

“The trials and the semifinals are
held on the same day and that’s six
races. This schedule is not conducive
for more than one event,” Agosti-
nella said.

 

Predicts
Eastern 8

mnrinuedfroni [7029 ’“'‘’I"‘'

Auslander said that these factors,
combined with West Virginia's dec-
lining quality ofplay oflate will send
Duquesne up to the next rung in the
tournament.

“It looks like a Pitt—Duquesne
final for the first time. That’s what
I’d like to see anyway,” Auslander
commented.

If there is a Pitt—-Duquesne con-
frontation in the finals, Auslander
hinted the game is almost too close
too call.

“Based on the first two games, it’s
hard to say what will happen," Aus-
lander said. “Rice hurt his team in
the second game at the Arena when
he put ‘Duquesne into a stall to pro-
tect their lead. There was still about
nine minutes to go, and Pitt was able
to get back in the game late, even
though Duquesne finally won by a
point.”

“I like both schools, so it's hard to
call this game. I hopes-Pitt wins.”

Auslander was willing to specu-
late on the possibilities ofa National
Invitational Tournament (NIT) bid,
should neither Pitt or Duquesne win
the Eastern 8 Final.

“A Pitt—Duquesne NIT game
would bring in a lot of money and
draw a lot of peopleito the Arena,”
Auslander said. “And let's face it
that’s what the NIT is interested in is
games that willmake money.”

“Last year’s game was a big suc-
cess, and they drew a sellout, but
Rice had to make a telephone call to
the NIT and he finally sold the idea
to them. If the Dukes win the tour-
nament, I don't know if Pitt will get
in with a I6 or 17-12 record.
Duquesne probably has a good shot
to go to the NIT should Pitt.win the
Eastern 8, because they have a bett_er
season record.” L

As for the chances ofa Pitt—West
Virginia game in the NIT tourna-
ment, Auslaner said itrwould proba-
bly depend again on whether
someone could sell the idea to the
NIT.

“There might be something there.
I know a lot of West Virginia’s fans
com_e up to Pittsburgh for the East-
ern 8 games and the tournament, so
it could happen. If I was picking it, I
think that the chance of a Pitt—-
West Virginia game would also be
good if it were played in Morgan-

Track Team Into Easterns

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Assistant Sports Editor

Members of the Pitt Women's
track team, who have distinguished
themselves in the regular season, will
take part in the Division ll Eastern
Association for Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (EAIAW)
Indoor Championships" at Boston
College starting Friday. Entered
from-Pitt are: the two mile relay
team of Gwen Murray, Valerie
Strasser, Sally Higgins, Pam Gear-
ing; shot putter Peri Radecic; and
Kathy Dvorsak in the pentathlon.

Even before they have had a_

Gwen Murray hopes to spearhead the Pitt women tirackstersi t a successful Eastern show-ing

 
 
 

chance to run, the relay team suf-
fered a setback when Gearing pulled
up limping with an injury. This
injury is going to hurt as Dvorsak
may -be forced to run in her_place,
greatly reducing Pitt’s chances.

The two Pantherettes with the
best chance of capturing honors are
Murray and Radecic-. Murray, who
will compete in the 300 meters at the
Easterns, has already achieved, a
much higher goal. Already con-
firmed for the Nationals, Murray
hopes that she will take the 300 and
400 meter titles. Regardless of the

still win» or finish amongst the lead-
ers at Easterns. '

Radecic, has enjoyed a very con-
sistent year and also is a threat to
win in the shotput. Others who will
be competing are Strasser, in her
specialty the 1500 meters and Hig-
gens, also in the l500 meters. This
fact of two 1500 meter specialists
shows the Pantherette depth. Dvor-
sak will also be entered in the gruel-
ing pentathlon. ”

Apart from Gearing’s key injury .
the Pantherettes hope to do well at
Easterns and hopefully move on to
Nationals where Gwen Murray will '
already be waiting.

By SAUL MARKOWITZ

Pill New Stall Writer

He's not as well known as, let’s
say, Hugh Green or Sam Clancy, but
to Pitt Hockey fans right winger.
Dave Forry is as important to his
squad as the two players mentioned
above are to their sport.

Forry has accomplished a lot
since he began playing hockey at the
age of l2. He decided to participate
in the fast-paced game because
hockey was “a different sport to try."

Forry enjoys reminiscing about
the first time he played hockey. He
began his career in his home town of
Lititz, Pa, a small town outside of
Lancaster. When Forry first stepped

other members of his team were
more skilled at the game than he
was.

But, after much hard work and, as
he stated, “long hours on the ice,”
Forry became confident enought to
play for a club from Hershey, Pa.

Before coming to play hockey at
Pitt, Forry played for four different
clubs: Lancaster and three teams
from Hershey. After being onthe
Hershey Junior lcers, Forry was
well-rounded enough to be chosen
for the Hershey All-Stars.

Forry added that “just to play on
Hershey, go on to the All-Stars and
then be chosen to be on the Pitt
hockey team was one goal that I’m

glad l accomplished." A

The road to Pitt was tough for
Forry.

“I always wanted to be better," he
said. “After a while things started to
work for me."

And work well they did. Forry,
since joining Pitt, has become the

g fourth leading scorer on the team.

His fine play and outstanding skat-
ing ability are evident immediately
when watching a Pitt game.

Did Forry ever think of playing
hockey for a career?

“I hope that one day my dream of
being an engineer will become a real-
ity," he added. “But if a great offer
by a hockey team comes along I
might just consider it. The option is

always open.”

Forry commented that he feels
that his success in hockey is mainly
due to the constant reinforcement by
his parents. “They support me l00
percent. That’s why I went so far. 1
couldn‘t have done it without their
support.

One problem faced by Pitt this
season, Forry believes, is the lack of
fans in attendance. “The team has
the capability to do better, but we
need more support by the fans,”
Forry said. “It will give the team
more of an incentive to win.

At‘ the beginning of the season

Forry was unsure about what it was‘

going to be like to play for a colle-
giate team.

onto the ice, he noticed that the

“Ex—coach Larry Newell changed
my attitude toward hockey," Forry

said. “Plus the attitude of all the

veterans toward the freshman has

_ made things pleasant for me. Eve-

ryone is close and it is a good
feeling.”

Only a freshman, Forry looks for-
ward to three more years with the
Pitt Hockey Team;

when process industry companies select
C-E Lummus to design a process or build an en-
tire facility for them, they are guided in their de-
cision by the excellent reputation of C-E Lummus’
engineering staff and our record of technical ac-
complishments-over the past seventy-five years.

Our product is our expertise, and our pro-
fessionals are the source. That’s why we seek,
hire, train, and promote the best qualified engi-
neers. If you’re one of them, we have a great deal
to offer you.

At C-E Lummus, you will be on the lead-
ing edge of energy and process technology. You
will be involved in project assignments that will
test your ingenuity and reward your achieve-
ments in ways very few companies and industries
can match. . ‘

You can also expect plenty of diversity at
C-E Lummus. We've got experience in just about
every industry that needs a process—from the
petrochemical, chemical, synfuel, and agricul-
tural, to pulp and paper, food and plastics.

Your areas of involvement could range
from helping design a facility, to developing a
new process concept, to applying—and even
pioneering—an advance in environmental engi-
neeﬁng.

Consider joining the team industry looks
to for leadership.

- I urgently need fellow travelers. Trip
is a university travel tour. Will consider
bein a third or fourth in a room Larry
34l- 879, mornings.

The quickestway to get  
emergenc money.

 

An emergency stop for repairs can
wipe out even the best-heeled traveler.
Luckily, all you need is the price of a
phone call to get you the money before
your car gets ‘off the lift. Here’s What to
do when you need money in a hurry.

1: Call home. Report the situation, and

tell the folks they can get emergency
cash to you fast by phone.

2 I Ask them to call Western Union’s
toll-free number, 800-325-6000 (in
Missouri, 800-342-6700), anytime, day or
night. They charge the money and the
service fee to their MasterCard* or

Western Union Charge Card Money Order. .

 

VISAT card. A Western Union Charge
Card Money Order, up to $1,000, will be
ﬂashed to the Western Union office or
agent nearest your emergency.

3 I Pick up your money—usua1ly within
two hours——at the local Western Union '
office or agent. There are 8,500
nationally, except in Alaska.
Conveniently, about 900 locations are
open 24 hours. It’s that easy. * '

Be sure toremind your parents about
our toll-free number. It’s all they need to
' call Western Union to the rescue. r

‘The MasterCard _name is owned by Interbank Card Association.
‘The VISA name is o’wned by VISA International.
