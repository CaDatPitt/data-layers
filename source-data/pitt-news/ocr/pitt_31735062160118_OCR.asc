A Better Chest

The'Spring section of the Pitt Chest is i

currently roaring to a successful climax.
When the sponsors get together to count
the receipts over the weekend, they should
ﬁnd ya gratifying pile of cash. They have
managed to combine the ordinarily painful
process of extracting money with entertain-
ment and, from all indications, the combina-
tion is ideal. ‘ '

In fact, the methods used’ this last week
are so good that they should also be used in
the fall. Then, the Chest could mix in some
amusement with the appallingly uninspir-
ing tacticsof classroom solicitation. Few peo-
ple are moved to part with their cash by the
‘speakers who hit them during class hours.
f It might even be better if the Chest chair-
Omen got together and decided to restrict
their campaign to one week in the entire
year, instead of the traditional two. There
is no real reason why they cannot now de-
cide to do this; there are plenty of reasons
, why they should.

rglf there were only one drive per year, the‘
administrative costs would be pared in half,
all of the enthusiasm which is now divided
could be channeled into one supreme effort,
and the student body would not feel that it
‘ exists for no other reason than to shell out
cash.

The argument becomes even more persu-
asive when you consider that during the fall
most. of the large charities in the city are
also conducting their fund—raising programs.
The student, if he is a commuter, is hit both
at home and in school, and it is your guess

i as to.how many other places. ‘ _ '

' _ Moneyi contributed to the,Pitt C‘hest,un-

I der whatever. circumstances goes to worthy
causes. The'more money collected the bet-
ter. One of the best ways to increase the
totals is by doing what the/Chest did this
week and doing it only once a year.

"in Our laml"

, According to the calendar spring is oili-
cially upon us today. But we didn’t need a
.~calendar to tell us, for spring is a state of
* mind as well as a state of nature. We pass
along toyou one of the oldest expressions
,. of that state of mind because it expresses,
,’more or less, our own. It was said by Solo-
mon long before we were born.
“‘For lo! The winter is past, the rain is
over and gone; the ﬂowers appear on the
' earth; the time of the singing of the birds
is come, andthe voice of the turtle is heard

.ilE;asy Does It
  W JOHN Kuuwlen

We see by today’s Pitt Poll thait the local profs
(at least‘some of them) are in favor of allowing

students to do a little on-campus‘ campaigning for
’ their off-campus political favorites.

A .good sign. It’s hard to ﬁgure why or how the
opinions of a bunch of political amateurs, (which
we are) could be interpreted as the ofﬁcial views
  of the administration.

Since students come here to
practice reading, speaking, writ-
ing, and all kinds of other things,
it doesn’t make sense that they
shouldn’t be allowed to practice
what to our way of life is almost
as important: politics.

In a way, though, you can’t
blame the administration_ for
_ handling the business with kid
gloves. Professional politicians as a class seem to
have remarkable sensitive natures, and are liable
to get their feelings hurt at anything not obviously
in their favor. .

. they’re making honey, and you're bound to get
 stung. «

The Intellectual Equinox

JACK MARKOWITZ

People with calendars no doubt
remarked yesterday the arrival
ofspring as expected.

' Actually the day of the equinox
is of minor signiﬁcance except
for keeping calendars in order.
Of greater import to the indi-
vidual person is that first day
each year,‘ usually in February,
when he looks to the heavens at
5:30 in the afternoon, and, gaz-
ing at his __friends with a wild

surmise, says, “Gee, the days are *

getting longer.” It is a source of
annual amazement.

Maybe, someday educators will
get progressive enough to squeeze
eight months of school into six,
and end the school year on the
ﬁrst day ofspring. .

When the weather ‘gets good,
the intellect has a tendency to
rebel. That is the time when a
student gives up concentrating on
a text book afterthe ﬁrst ten
minutes, suddenly rationalizes
that Life (with a capital L) is
more important than books, and
‘(lashes out into the mad Spring
air.

It becomes very easy to con-
vince yourself that a walk un-

der the azure is more valuable
than the best of printed pages.
-Autumn is the time for read-
ing, and if profs wanted to get
the best out of their students,
they I would pile on the work
then. The autumn temperature
has the effect of encouraging in-
tellectual pursuits in the student.
A book is a cold weather friend.
But spring is the season of dis-
content. You want to be in other
places, walking with other guys’
girls. In effect, you want to do
anything you are not.doing now,
especially if you are doing school
work. , ;
Two goals——fun and knowl-

.edge—vie for the soul of the

spring student. K n o w l e dyg e
doesn’t have a chance.

In a few weeks, couples will be
sitting out under the saplings on
the Cathedral ‘lawn.

The student needs to see that
sight only once, and he’ll be con-

T vinced that the only reasonable

philosophy for spring is Omar
Khayyam’s:' V
A book of Verses underneath
the Bough,

A Jug of‘ Wine, a Loaf of Bread

Ugly Men
~ LOIS FOIGHT
Michigan State News

An epidemic of men
throughout the United States. As a means of rais-

A ing money for chest drives and other philanthropic ‘

projects, “Ugly Man” contests are a favorite.
At Michigan State, where the contest has just been
concluded, $1,693.51 was the toga}. '
made from the voting.
The Daily Collegian

At Penn State, the staff of the
Collegian circulated a fake; pe-
tition among the studentsto ﬁnd
out how many would read it
through before signing their
names. Fifty per cent signed the
“so-called” petition for free-
dom. *‘

The trick sentence was hidden in the middle of

, a paragraph: “We give the bearer of this petition V
permission, upon receipt of our signature, to hang .~ ”

us by the necks until dead.”

,Of l65 students approached, 81 willingly signed‘  

the petition. But, moaned the Collegian, “The un-
fortunatepart of it all is that only 37 of the 84
who wouldn’t sign noticed this deadly sentence.”

The Review -»_ _

At the University of Delaware, the, Committee
on the Coordination of Student Affairs set up a rule
governing the appearanceof women in men’s resi-
dences.

The rule: ‘,‘Women are not allowed to visit
in fraternity houses of men’s dormitories at
any time except on the occasion of social event
which has been approved by the dean of
women and the dean of men.”

In callenginglthe rule, the Review editor pro-

posed the question: “When the weather is incle-v

ment, is it permissible to allow women to wait for
men for a short time within the house instead or
on an exposed porch or step?”

The answer came back, “No. Courtesy would
require that women should not have to wait and

careful planning would keep this situation from

arising?“

DEAD EYE——Bill Noroski, senior gunner for Sgt. Paul Bryan’s
corp, is exactly that shooting from the prone position.
ﬁred a record-breaking 291 against Carnegie Tech and California
Teachers in a triangular meet this year. He hit the bulls eye ten

straight times.

NorosIci’s 280 :P*a:ces
Title-Seeking Riflers

By RU SS FRANKE

Bill Noroski is one Panther
who is at home on the range,
regardless of whose range it is.

He has been one of Sgt. Paul
Bryan’s leading riﬂemen against
all opposition for the past three
years and his shooting is a good
reason why the squad is battling it
out with West Virginia for the
Greater Pittsburgh League cham-
pionship.

And Bill recently wrote his
name into the record book by fir-
ing a 291, the highest in Pitt his-
tory and only nine points away
from a perfect score.

Leading Squad

The 20-year-old chemical en-
gineering senior is currently lead-
ing the squad -with an individual
average of 280. Last year he led
throughout most of the season. but

Noroski

was finally topped by Andre Le-
vino and shared second-place hon-
ors with Newman Howard at 281.

Bill will take his parting shots
in league competition next Wed-
nesday when the Panthers clash
with the Mountaineers for the title
on the Washington and Jefferson
range.

The next meet for the locals,
however, is carded for this Sat-
urday when they journey to New
York for the Buffalo Regionals.

High School Staff

Championship competition is
nothing new to Bill, for he was a
three-year member of the Munhall
High team, which is a perennial
winner in high school circles.

There he became‘interested in
the sport for the ﬁrst time, and
set out with his trusty Winchester
on the trail to Pitt.

Hitting Surprises

Mittmen Powerful

The Panther baseballers took up where they left off last
week by going outdoors to stage another hitting barrage.
~ In the longest session held so far, Coach Ralph Mitter-,
ling sent his charges through 15°

innings of inter—squad play Tues-
day at the stadium shuffling the
lineups in an effort to find the best
combination.

Hitting Surprising

And it looks as though that
combination‘ will be made up of
the boys with strength at the plate,
since every ﬁelding position is
overcrowded.

Bobby Lewis, Mitterling’s assist-
ant, says, “The way they have been
hit_ting is surprising. We’ve
switched a couple of the boys
around to new positions to get
more power, and they have been

coming through.”

7 Too Early To Tell

“Of course, I don’t have my
pitchers throwing too hard yet,”
warns Mitterling, “so it’s a little
early to tell how our batting will
shape up later on.”

Mitterling is giving everyone a‘
chance to nail down a spot on the

i

, club, and doesn’t expect to 'make

any ﬁnal decisions until sometime
next week.

“The more outdoor work we get,
explains the coach, “the sooner
we’ll know just who is going to
play.”

Tonight’s IM Sports Carnival will open the Field House

doors for the ﬁrst time to the students.

. During the months that it was being constructed, th
Field House was heralded as a big thing for Pitt stu-
dents. But unfortunately the clicking of turnstiles seems
more important to the Universityithan the enjoyment of

the . students.

fact that the

The ﬁnal strike that knocks

and into the remodeled Stadium
is the fact that so many WPIAL

At the same time. these high
school stars at e performing‘

officials approached the University
for the Friday date for the Ava-

down in preference to IM Carnival

this affair will be staged annually.

be played the width of the Field
House rather than the length.
In other words the length of the

V ﬂoor tonight will be about 80
feet, whereas the Panthers used
a 112-foot hardwood this past
winter.

If the Pitts would use -an 80-
foot ﬂoor, they would not only be
nearer to the basket against a zone
defense, but they would also be
conserving much needed energy
for running the Figure Eight.

Pitt's Gibson Lab
  Finds Important
  Cancer Diagnosis

By JACK MARKOWITZ
Photography by Sanford Gorby

The treatment of brain cancer has always been hampered
by one basic obstacle—the impossibility of knowing, without
opening the skull, where the tumor actually is located in
the almost completely bone-surrounded brain.

But today ingenious scientists at Pitt’s Addison H. Gib-
son Laboratory are “seeing” through the baffling obstacle of
skull by a new method that makes it possible to locate, be-
fore surgery, the majority of curable brain tumors.

The method Worked out at Gibson does not constitute a
cure for cancer. Dr. Campbell Moses, director of the lab lo-
cated in Old Mellon Institute on O’Hara Street, cautions that
the ‘tumor “localization” method is only a helpful diagnostic
technique to aid brain surgeons in operating on tumors with
greater certainty and effectiveness.

 In the Gibson lab’s process, the location of a tumor is
found by a device similar to a Geiger counter. _ __

First step in the method is the injection of alradioactive (Above) MEASURING AND MONITORING-——Robert
solution into the patient’s blood stream._ This solution cir-
culates to all parts of the body, but as it circulates through
cancerous tissue, part of it leaks into _that tissue from in-- _ _ _ _ _ _ _ V _ _ _
 blood vessels. After a half—hour, during which-» time “°“s °°“t"“‘““">' "3'd‘°a"‘“’° ‘°d“‘°’ ‘° be ‘“_’°°“’d 1"
the blood stream circulates many times through the _body, the blood stream of a brain tumor patient. On the right
most of the radioactive solution will have collected in the is Jgseph H_ Sunder, holding a monitor to determine
cancer, while very little of it enters the healthy parts of t_ e
body. The cancer thus becomes a small pocket of radio-
activity. i , _

' A Geiger counter—which measures the amount of bars ‘O 9"‘ °5 h*“"mf“1'ad‘3“1°“-
radioactivity in a given place—can then be passed over
the body, and where the counter ﬁnds the greatest amount
of radioactivity, there is the cancer.

But before the method could be perfected, the lab had
to ﬁnd the right radioactive material for injection and, most
important, had to develop a more accurate radiation counter
than the Geiger. ‘ .

On the first problem, the Gibson people ‘got an assist
from Dr. George Moore of the University of Minnesota, who
suggested the use of radioactive iodine dissolved in a liquid

chemical called ﬂuorescein. The iodine proved successful.

acc1.irate'‘"than old countem - When» the Nechaj counter is placed next to the skull,
rays from the radioactive cancer strike a sensitive grain in
the head of the counter. When hit by a ray, this grain im-
mediately “scintillates,” or lights up, and the tiny flash oi
light is recorded and counted. The closer the counter ap-
proaches to the location of the cancer the more counts are
recorded. The counter is delicate enough that only a small
amount of radioactive solution need be injected.

Dr. Moses estimates the patient undergoes no more
danger of harmful radiation than he would from taking
an X-Ray picture.

But technicians who use the localization method-. clini-
cally (it has been used on over.90 patients at Presbyterian-
Women’s Hospital) cannot simply pass the counter at random
over the skull.

, Gibson workers Agatha DeLacio and Clem Russ employ;
a precise technique, by which the counter is placed in 38 sta-
tionary positions around and over the patient’s head. For each
position, a radioactivity count is marked electrically on a_
graph. ' ~
One more step, employing a foam rubber model of the '
patient’s skull, completes the process of localizing the tumor.
The 38 counting positions are marked on the model. Re-
ferring to the graph paper, a lab technician pierces the model
with a long needle at every position where a high count was
registered. The model is then turned over, and where the
needles intersect", the cancer is located. ‘
Dr. Moses emphasizes that the process is effective only
when the cancer is at the surface of the brain. If it is -deep
Within the brain, no matter what positions the counfer is
placed in, the counts will be almost the same, and  con-
clusions about the location of the cancer can be mace.

The new method offers some hope for the es rly de-
tection of surface tumors, which are operable. But no
conclusive resuIts,,can yet be estimated, Dr. Moses said.
He added that at present it is best to consider the local-
ization method as a technique to be consulted, along with

V other diagnoses, by brain surgeons.

SC Polls Students
On By-laws Change

Student Congress will present a questionnaire to the
student body next week to obtain the reaction and opinions
of students on some legislation coming up in Congress.

Dan Berger, chairman of

the poll committee, has sched-

uled a list of question which deal:

with the proposed change in SC
by-laws.
The revision would open Con-

. gress positions to the students and

include representation from or-
ganizations rather than strictly
from junior and senior classes.
Sample Questions '

The poll will include the fol-

lowing questions:

1. Do you favor open cam-
paigning such as soap-box
oratory, posters, etc?

2. Do you think more people
would vote as a result of open
campaigning‘? . '

3. Do you think open campaign-
ing would put more qualified peo-
ple in these positions than the
present system of restricted cam-
paigning does?

At the present time, representa-
tion in Student Congress is appor-
tioned to the junior and senior
classes and the proportion of men
and women in these classes.

Direct Presentation

There is now sentiment toward
giving representation in Congress
directly to campus organizations

In line with this, the poll asks:

1. Are you in favor of this new
idea? I

2. Do you think this plan would
increase student interest and par-
ticipation in Congress?

Another question to be asked
concerns the payment for the Owl,
which is now sold through Owl
salesmen. Congress would like to
know: Would you be willing to
pay a fee (no more than $1) at
each registration (to be included
in the registration fee) so that on
graduation you would automatic-
ally receive a copy of the Owl?

Taken Next Week

Berger said that the poll will be
conducted Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday of next week.

Another idea that Congress is
trying to put across is the use of
suggestion boxes. Tom Piemme,
chairman of the committee, has
obtained seven new, suggestion
boxes which he will post strategic-
ally throughout the building.

The boxes were made by the
Schenley High School manual
training classes for the price of
the materials used.

Piemme hopes to stimulate more
interest in SC aifairs by getting
student opinion through the boxes.
