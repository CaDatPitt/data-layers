Looking out at the crowd of students wearing
“We Love Nordy” t—shirts, Chancellor Mark A.
Nordenberg smiled as he began his speech of
gratitude to Pitt students.

“These ‘We Love Nordy’ shirts are just short-

RIVERHOUNDS

White shirts with the slogan, ‘Release Your
Inner Hound,’ could be seen around the
stadium in Station Square.

With excitement in the air, the River-
hounds organization and its supporters
hope that a fate similar to that of the Pitts-
burgh steel industry will not befall the team.

On March 27, Riverhounds Events
Center, LP, owner of the Pittsburgh River-
hounds and Highmark Stadium, ﬁled for
Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court for the Western District of Pennsyl-

vania. According to federal law, Chapter 11
Bankruptcy Protection provides companies
with temporary relief from their creditors
as they try to restructure themselves, and
is frequently called reorganization bank-
ruptcy.

Kutney will rely on the legal system for
help.

“Within the next 13 weeks, we’ll put
a plan together, and we’ll go before the
bankruptcy courts and hopefully they will
allow us to move forward with our plan,”
Kutney said.

The Pittsburgh Riverhounds soccer
team formed in 1999 and now plays as a
professional team in the United States soc-
cer league system, often called the Ameri-
can soccer pyramid. Before moving to
Highmark Stadium, which was completed
in April 2013, the Riverhounds were a sort
of ‘nomad’ soccer team, playing around
the Pittsburgh area on high school ﬁelds,
including Chartiers Valley High School in
Bridgeville, Pa.

The bankruptcy, while shocking to
many, will not affect the Riverhounds’ busi-
ness operations. The team plans to operate
as scheduled according to an ofﬁcial state-
ment on its website.

“It was a little bit startling when the an-
nouncement came out, but we quickly un-
derstood what [the bankruptcy] was about,
and the Riverhounds continue to be just as
supportive, if not more so,” Robert Gilbert,
an associate professor of marketing and
business economics at Pitt, said.

Gilbert teaches Projects in Marketing,
a course that gives students ﬁrst-hand ex-

perience in a temporary advertising agency
called ProsInMotion, which works with the
Pittsburgh Riverhounds.

In the past, Projects in Marketing stu-
dents have worked with clients such as
Honda, Mazda and the National Football
League. According to Gilbert, his students
have come in ﬁrst place in national market-
ing competitions while working on their

Giuifrida hopes that ProsInMotion’s
campaign will help the team in its journey
towards restructuring.

“I think our campaign really helped
them. Today, everyone was wearing their
shirts on campus, and everyone was talking
about it. I am glad that happened.” Giuf-
frida said.

Gilbert explained that ProsInMotion

projects.

Maggie Giuffrida, the director of public
relations for ProsInMotion and a senior
marketing major , said she saw the news
of the bankruptcy on television and was
surprised.

“We had class that day, and once we real-
ized that it was Chapter 11 and understood
what that meant, we continued everything
just the way we were working,” Giuffrida
said.

operates as a “working marketing agency”
with four main departments, including re-
search, campaign strategy, advertising and
public relations. '
The agency meets with clientsand strat-
egizes a plan to target Pitt students.
Students from the class placed ‘join The
Pack’ signs around campus to promote the
Riverhounds brand to Pitt students. The
campaign featured selling tickets, hold-
ing events with the players, promoting the

company on social media and closing out
the campaign with a tailgate at Highmark
Stadium before the game on Saturday.

For Gilbert, after working with so many
high proﬁle companies, the Riverhounds
project was a breath of fresh air.

“It’s very different from working with
the Steelers or the Pirates,” Gilbert said.
“The players are very approachable. We’ve
shot videos with them, and they came to our
event that we had on campus and hung out
with students.”

The strategy worked.

Gilbert said that ProsInMotion had suc-
cessﬁilly sold the allotment of tickets that
the Riverhounds had given to the agency.

“We are thrilled with how it’s gone so
far,” Gilbert said.

Although-the team currently plays in
the United Soccer League’s Professional
Division the Riverhounds will become a
Houston Dynamo — a Major League Soc-
cer team — affiliate in 2014. The team has
hopes to continue moving up to become a
Major League Soccer team as well.

“We have a 10-year plan in which we can
prove that Pittsburgh is a market that can

"sustain an MLS franchise,” Kutney said.

The team’s fans, including Daniel Yost,
director-at—large of the Steel Army, believe
in the possibilities for the Riverhounds
franchise as well.

“This city has always been built on many
different ethnic groups,” Yost said. “Many
of them are Europeans and soccer is the
biggest sport in Europe. It really gives us a

chance to all get together a support a single

cause: the Riverhounds.”

While the Steel Army is independent of
the Riverhounds organization, the groups
frequently work in conjunction with one
another.

Yost had been working for the past six
months to organize the Steel Army’s activi-
ties for the 2014 Season, including a sports
version of an army-style march of the Steel
Army members into Highmark Stadium,
featuring drums, bazookas and trombones.

ProsInMotion’s efforts haven’t gone un-
noticed, either.

ish, came to the season opener with his

each Friday of this semester to planning We
Love Nordy Day.
Elizabeth Mattingly, a freshman nursing
major, was ecstatic upon receiving a T-shirt.
“I waited 40 minutes for a shirt, but it was
worth it,” Mattingly said. “I’m happy that the
tour groups of potential students got to see this

’ eventastheywalkby.”

Laura Kelly, a sophomore psychology and
English major, volunteered at the event, which
she saidwould be the onlyWe Love Nordy Day.

_ “I’m excited to be able to help with such an
event,” Kelly said as she passed aroundatray of
vegetables to attendees. “It’s a great way to show
Chancellor Nordenberg our appreciation.”

Amelia Brause, asenior majoringinnatural
sciences, was walking through the event and
noticed that the volunteers needed help, so
she assisted those already working.

“I’m extremely impressed and happy with
the turnout for this,” Brause said. “I’m happy
he gets to be recognized by the students at such
an event like this.”

Lynne Miller, who works with commuter
studentprograms in the Ofﬁce ofstudent Life,
shared similar sentiments on helping outasshe
handed out smiley face cookies to thecrowd.‘

“It’s a ﬁm atmosphere,” Miller said. “I’m
excited to be here for it.”

Nordenberg spoke at the event, keeping
the crowd engaged and smiling with him the
whole time.

“I couldn’t be happier. I couldn’t be more
grat ,” Nordenberg said at the conclusion
of his speech.

Members ofthe Resident Student Associa-
tion marched to the event carrying signs that
displayed the appreciation that each residence
hall had for Nordenberg. The marching stu-
dents also chanted “P-I—T—T” as they walked.

Neil Diamond’s “Sweet Caroline,” normally
played at Pitt football games and known to
students as a school anthem of sorts, prompted
attendees to sing along at the event.

Lauren Kucic, a sophomore studying mar-
keting, enjoyed the event——— especiallythe free
food.

“The event is really cool, and the ﬁee food
is nice,” Kucic said. “[Nordenberg] does a lot
of different things for the smden .”

Jordan Shoup, president of the Oakland
Zoo, Pitt basketball’s ofﬁcial student section,
recalled a memory ofNordenbergthat shewill

“He wants to make things better for the
long run, not just the short run,” Shoup said.

According to Shoup, Nordenberg was al-
ready an honorary member of the Oakland
Zoo, but the ceremony made it permanent.

Nordenberg expressed his feelings about
the day and the event dedicated to him.

“I thinkthatthis event is unbelievable, and

Pitt’s campus. Craver was unaware of the
bankruptcy until informed at the season
opener. .

As the Riverhounds and the Wilmington
Hammerheads fought for possession on
the soccer ﬁeld, Craver said he was glad
that he was helping the club amidst the
restructuring.

“I am glad that we can support a club
that will hopefully help the community,”
Craver said. “Soccer is becoming a huge
sport in the United States.”

Though the team lost 4-3 on Saturday, it’s
clear that the team experienced a victory off
the ﬁeld. The Steel Army expressed those
sentiments during the game. According
to the Riverhounds and their supporters,
though, they are ﬁghting for much more
than rising from bankruptcy.

“I believe that we can win, I believe that
we can win,” they chanted.I

Millennial stereotypes undermine
solutions to generational problems

Nick Voutsinos
Columnist

As a 20-year-old working college
student, it’s frustrating to know
that I automatically belong to a
category of Americans described as
self-centered, shiftless freeloaders
who physically cannot stop taking-
selﬁes.

This caricature of the millennial
generation —— one the American
media has painted time and time
again — is frustrating for me be-
cause ﬁrstly, I can stop taking selﬁes
whenever I want. Secondly, ‘media
pundits and politicians constantly
use this stereotype as a scapegoat
for the dramatic increase in unem-
ployment among my generation.
But unemployment is rising not only
for the kids depicted by the media,
but also for minorities on the lower
end of the socioeconomic spectrum.

7 ‘For instance, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor recently released a re-

port on the latest trends in national _

employment. Thelreport presented
promising data for most: the overall
unemployment rate dropped to 6.7
percent. But the job market appar-
ently has not been as receptive to my
generation. Accordingto the report,
the unemployinent rate‘ for 20- to
24-year-olds isat about 12.2 percent,
and it’s‘ at»about14;5 percent for 16-

to24-year-olds» . - - . 3

lennials, and it should spark dis-
cussion and debate on how to ﬁx it.
Unfortunately, however, during my
daily online news browsing, I came
across an article on BBC that imme-
diately brought the discussion away
from rational discourse and once
again toward the aforementioned
stereotypes.

Beneath the article’s headline,
“Why can’t the selﬁe generation
ﬁnd jobs?”, was a photo of four
blonde Caucasian girls sporting
large—rimmed sunglasses and pos-
ing excitedly at what appears to be
an outdoor music festival.

The headline and the picture
divert the reader’s attention away
from the issue of millennial unem-
ployment. The fact of the matter is

And the reality
is that there
are scores’ of-
young people

who are trapped
in long—term
unemployment
because they
go uneducated
and unnoﬁced.

that these preconceived notions ,

placed on millennials —..- depicting
them as conceited, social-media-
crazed kids who take everything for
granted — clouds their status as the
generational category that makes up
a large percentage of unemployed
Americans. “

And the majority is not white,
carefree college students, as the
picture under the headline depicts.
Rather, the majority is all too often

made up of poor and undereducated‘ .

minorities.

According to research by the
Economic Policy Institute — a non-
partisan think tank that seeks policy
solutions for social and economic
problems —- the unemployment
rate among millennials aged 16 to 24
was almost doubled for blacks and
Hispanics, at 32.5 percent and 24.2
percent in 2010. And of those aged
25 to 32 who have bachelor’s degrees
or higher, the unemployment rate
is at 3.8 percent as compared to 8.1
percent for those with two-year de-
grees and 12.2 percent for those with
only a high school diploma.

Therefore, according to the num-
bers, the average unemployed mil-

lennial is hardly the white suburban

kid with a liberal arts degree living
in his or her parents’ basement. So
then why does the media continue to
paint this picture of our generation?

Unfortunately, I cannot give a
good reason for why the pundits do
it, because I simply cannot make

.’ sense of it. Nonetheless, it’s.an ab-

solute travesty that these prejudices
continue to be promoted, given that
a large group of millennials —— who
obviously do not represent these
stereotypes -— need real help, not
a lecture, when it comesto getting
a job. .

Therefore, the discussion led

by media punditsand politicians,

must focus on the reality of the situ-
ation. And the reality is that there
are scores of young people who are
trapped in long—term unemploy-
ment because they go. uneducated
and urmoticed. I

quire applicants to have some kind of work
experience. And being an underprivileged
millennial without the opportunity to gain
a college degree, while at the same time
facing a job market still recovering from
recession, certainly does not help_one gain
employment. .

schools can expand work experience pro-
grams that can teach young Americans the
skills needed to compete in the job mar-
ket without a costly college/tech school
education. The Obama administration,
for instance, has recognized this need, as
demonstrated in the recent grants it has
provided to Maryland high schools to in-
tegrate work experience programs into the
schools. These programs will give students
highly marketable skills in areas like infor-
mation technology and healthcare, which

they would not normally receive from a high
school diploma. 4

This policy should be applauded because
youth unemployment costs the United
States $25 billion a year in lost tax revenue.
Furthermore, according to Tim Donovan’s
article in Salon magazine, if the Department
of Labor took 600,000 new apprentices into
its Registered Apprenticeship,Program, this
would generate a return of $74.4 billion in
social beneﬁts to the U.S. economy. _

Clearly, then, targeting the poorer mi-

norities of the millennial generation — who
are in dire need of these opportunities -
could help tackle the unemployment prob-
lem plaguing my generation. But ﬁrst we
need to shift the focus toward these kids,
rather than the ones posting pictures of
their lunches on Instagram.

In other words, the spoiled white kid
stereotype needs to go, for the sake of those
who actually need attention, not for the ones
who apparently crave it. I

ARTS and ENTERTAINMENT

PAlNTlNC:S

Jack Trainor
Staﬂ Wrz'ter

Local artist Ron Donoughe has earned a
reputation for his Pittsburgh cityscapes
since he moved to Lawrenceville in the
‘80s, drawing attention from ﬁlmmakers
and local admirers alike. Known for his
Lawrenceville and Downtown scenes, the
Pennsylvania native is now expanding
his talents beyond his corner of the city.

In an ambitious project he calls the

. “9O Neighborhoods Project,” Donoughe

has been painting scenes from all 90 of

  cs poait, hoe nib

Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods in alphabeti-
cal order since last September. But paint-
ing is only half of the project.

The other half, perhaps the most im-
portant part of the project to Donoughe, is
his blog, where he posts a photo of every
painting and a blurb about his visit to each

~ neighborhood.

The project has become more of a so-
cial experiment,” Donoughe said. “What
happens when an artist just shows up
randomly and starts to work, and how do
people respond to that?” Apart from dis-
covering the character of places he’s never
been to before, Donoughe also interacts

with people from each neighborhood
through his project, which “has been a
greater learning experience” for him. A

These interactions not only make the
trips more memorable for Donoughe, but
they also work some magic on the art.

Once, when he was painting a church
in Mount Oliver, a man approached
Donoughe and told him how he had been
baptized in that very church and shared
the history _of the neighborhood -— all
without Donoughe having to ask. These
interactions are what make the project
so valuable to Donoughe.

“That’s why I didn’t work from pho-

ed at tim  e n

 
 

tos,’.’ he said. “That give and take really
gets into the spirit of _the.painting. You
get more passionate.about it, because
there’s a'story b’e_hind it. Lalmost hate
to see it end.” A3 4. .

Once all 90 neighborhoods are paint-
ed, Donoughe is unsureA‘_whéjtIhe;’ll do next.
He has a mural project in .C‘_a_mbria County
that he willgbegin to workpjon once all 90

About two months ago, Schoolboy Q re-.

leased his well—received Oxymoron on

Top Dawg Entertainment label. With‘ it, V

Top Dawg Entertainment — which in-
cludes big names such as Q, Kendrick La-
mar, Ab-Soul andjay Rock — cemented
its place on the frontlines of West Coast

hip—hop. Last week, however, Top Dawg .

Entertainment released a record that
falls a little bit out of sync with the label’s
established image: 24-year-old East Coast
R&B singer SZA’s new EP Z.

A slow, contemplative collection of
brilliant R&B tracks, the EP is simulta-
neously nothing like anything the label
has put out before and one of their best

releases to date.

The EP isn’t packed full of big—name
features, although checking the list of
producers on the EP gives readers names
as disparate and established as Mac Mill-
er and Tom y Moi. Instead, SZA runs
the show with a mix of her alternately
soulful, saccharine and ethereal vocals
and the judicious use of tracks whose
inﬂuences run the gamut. A

Some tracks, such as the album’s de-

. cidedly minimalist and hypnotic opener,

“UR,” settle nicelyinto the modern alter-
native R8zB canon alongside Jhene Aiko
and Frank Ocean, while others employ

_ ‘8os—styled synth beats as effectively as

Toronto band Austra, and still others
bare more soulful roots. Yet no matter
what sort of style she chooses to adorn
her impressive voice, it’s SZA’s beautiful,
arresting openness that makes each track
worth hearing. Bring it all together, and Z
is the rare album that makes you stop and

ST. VINCENT

St.Vincent wowed the Pittsburgh crowd

Shawn Cooke
Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

If there’s one thing that seems out
of place on St. Vincent’s “Digital Wit-
ness” tour, it’s drummer Matt]ohnson’s
bass drum.

Eschewing the stark-“St. V” logo
from the cover of St. Vincent’s self-
titled record, his drum sported a lone
Jon Stewart-Stephen Colbert bumper
sticker, which may or may not have been
a souvenir from the band’s recent per-
formance on “The Colbert Report.”

Annie Clark’s fame has been rising
exponentially in the last several months
with the “Colbert Report” visit, an ap-
pearance on “Portlandia” and, most
recently, teaming up with Nirvana to
perform “Lithium” at the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame induction ceremony. So
for an act that will, on future tours,
likely be playing for much larger crowds

than Friday’s indoor Stage AE show, the
sticker is an endearing suggestion that
maybe this powerful frontwoman and
her band are still adjusting to the fame.

But Clark, or Clark’s dynamic stage
persona, suggests quite the opposite.

In an interview with the Pittsburgh
Tribune-Review, Clark adamantly as-
sured that she doesn’t assume a charac-
ter of any type, but rather ﬁnds interest
in “exploring all the intricacies ofwhat
it is to be human.” But on stage, Clark
embodies the traits of a robot, wild

running, running, rattle behind me,”
for a rousing performance of “Rattle-
snake.”

Most of Clark’s songs, at least from
her latest album, are propelled by this
zany, bouncy energy, which she match-
‘es with highly choreographed perfor-

Reverse,” Clark and keyboardist Toko
Yasuda alternately fluttered from the
front to the back of the stage in a syn-
chronized marionette dance. To match
the explosive tribal drumbeat of “Year

hands and marched with high knee-
kicks. But unlike many 21st century pop
stars, dance and physicality weren’t the
only sources for dazzle.

 In addition to pitch—perfect and
emotive vocals, which are far too eas-
ily taken for granted, Clark proved that
she’s an eccentric guitar shredder, first

geon,” with an authority and confidence

The Clemente Museum a testament to one of Pittsbu1°gl1’s legends

Jack Trainor
Staff Wrz'ter

Pittsburgh is known to idolize its sports stars,

. an obsession reinforced through statues and

public spaces named after the greatest ath-
letes to pass through the city. Even in Oakland,
Mazeroski Field, a softball ﬁeld, honors the
loyalty of the career-long Pirate Bill ‘Maze-
roski, who played in Pittsburgh for nearly
20 years. -

There is also the Roberto Clemente Bridge,
connecting PNC Park with Downtown, which
honors perhaps one of Pittsburgh’s most be-
loved idols, the late Roberto Clemente. If this
weren’t enough, a majestic golden statue was
built in his honor outside the park’s gate, like
a tribute to a god.

But out of sight from PNC Park and on the
outskirts of Lower Lawrenceville exists per-
haps an even greater tribute to Clemente: The
Clemente Museum, an old ﬁrehouse-turned-
museum exclusively exhibiting Clemente’s
legacy.

“Through the museum, we are able to

continue the legacy of Roberto Clemente
not only as a baseball player, but an amazing
person and his humanitarian efforts,” Duane
Rieder, founder and local photographer,said
in an email.

The museum is home to the largest collec-
tion of Clemente memorabilia in the country,
if not the world, thanks to the help of Clem-

ente’s wife Vera Clemente , whom Rieder met I

in 1994 whﬂe working on a calendar project.
Rieder quickly became interested in her sto-
ries about’Clemente. I
According to Rob Ruck, professor of his-
tory at Pitt,-I part of the museum’s success is

the close-relationship between Rieder and ~

the Clemente family. --

“Duane has obviously gained the family’s

trust.”Ruck.said- .

Vera and Rieder developed a close rela-
tionship. Vera, who resides in Puerto Rico,
visits the museum at least once a year, drawing
large crowds of Clemente’s friends and family.

The Clemente Museum is constructed en-
tirely in homage to the great right ﬁelder. It
is a nonproﬁt organization with the sole mis-

sion of, according to the museum’s website,
“preserving the legacy of ‘The Great One,’ as
his fans affectionately called him.”

, Much ofthe museum’s content, from leas-
ing contracts to doctor’s notes, comes from
Vera’s. personal collection. Each item has its

own story unseen from the public eye.f'1'on1°ie»"3‘*

when Clemente was still playing.
“You really don’t know what this place is

like until you get here,” Rick Milsom,  tour ‘
guide at the museum, said. Milsom joined the L ,
museum in August after retiringﬁ’omacareer_i,

asahistory teacher. j I , ' I

The basement is home to Rieder’s own

wine brewery, Engine House 25, which has .
V hosted all kinds of celebrities who have toured

the museum, from famed sports broadcaster

Bob Costas to Pearljam singer Eddie Vedder.

Most celebrities who visit leave behind
a signature in recognition of their tribute to
Clemente.

“We are very lucky to attract the athletes,
coaches and celebrities that we do,” Rieder
said. “Most of them come to see us because
they are either huge baseball fans, are Puerto

Rican like Roberto or maybe their parents

loved Roberto.” ,

Rieder said that current professional base-
ball players and otherathletes will often visit
the museum while in town to face Pittsburgh’s
teams. But while it attracts famous out-of-
towners, Ruck thinks the museum’s value has
yet to be ﬁilly comprehended by the city.

“I think it will play a more important role
in preserving Roberto’Clemente’s legacy in
years to come,” he said. V '

But with the popularity the museum en-
joys, it has undoubtedly started not only pre-
servingbut also solidifying Clemente’s legacy
as one of Pittsburgh’s mostlbeloved heroes.

“[The Clemente Museum] is an underap-
preciated asset to Pittsburgh,” Ruck said. I

stare at the speakers, unsure of whether

you want to call up that old ﬂame, or just
stare at a picture of her and cry.
Nowhere is this more apparent than
on the EP’s second track, “Childs Play,”
where a feature from Chance The Rap-
per —— last year’s biggest breakout art-
ist -— only heightens the emotion. Over

- a stripped-down track that puts reality

in slow motion, SZA sings about child-
hood memories and unrequited love so
poignantly that you feel like you’re right
there with her as she rips the heads off of
her Barbie dolls with the detached misery
of a lonely little girl.

When Chance The Rapper takes
over the song, chiming in before SZA is
through singing, it’s a gorgeous confes-
sion in an empty hotel room. He cracks
one-liners and prattles on brilliantly:
“I only write rhythm to the tardiest of
tempos/ Only ride shotgun when the car
is a limo.” But there’s a sense of ennui
in his ﬂow — the feeling that all of the
success can’t quite ﬁll the void.

Top Dawg Entertainment labelmate
Kendrick Lamar puts on an equally im-
pressive —— and painfully heartfelt -
showing on “Babylon,” but .in both_in-
stances SZA’s presence controls the mood
of the track. She’s giving these rappers
the right space to express an emotional
depth that doesn’t get to show through
on their biggest hits. .

The amount of hype and scrutiny that
SZA — who up to this point has quietly
released a small handful of EPs and told
Billboard magazine that, as recently as
last year, she was working the ﬂoor at a
New York Sephora store —- faced leading
up to the release of E was unquestion-
ably a product of the “next big thing”—
obsessed age of Internet stardom. But
so is SZA. -

is what you should put on once everyone’s
gone home and you realize that you’re

‘ that made the minimalism and quiet

intricacy of their solos all the more
impressive. On record, an Annie Clark
guitar solo is rarely ﬂashy, but in a live

« setting, it squeals, doubles in length

and blows apart the lush calm before
the storm. I

‘ . One such hurricane, the solo of al— '

bum Strange Mercy’s “Northern Lights,”
had a minor hiccup when Yasuda’s
theremin, the backbone of the song’s
chaos, wasn’t coming through over the
monitor. Clark proceeded as normal and
brought the shredding up to Johnson’s
drum platform, ignoring the absence
of chaos.

After Clark collapsed and rolled
around for an erratic performance of
“Krokodil” to close out the main set, she
reemerged in a black dress and jacket
with massive shoulder pads for a chill-
ing encore. -

From atop a towering three-step
platform, Clark stood alone with her
guitar, illuminated by a single spotlight,

and belted out her best song, “Strange
Mercy.” '

Much like the album version, the
performance was an arresting and

emotionally direct rendition of a song .

with lyrics that avoid easy resolution.

I ever meet the dirty policeman who

ders the particulars meaningless. And
the underscoring of the whole song by
gorgeousuarpeggios, coos and humsto
ﬁll in the band’s absence made it the
sho_w’s most transcendent four minutes.

Just for a moment, Clark abandoned
the wild dance moves, guitar virtuosity
and distant expressions to assertively

30 years aft their zeith, Meta|lica’s act wears thin

Jackson Crowder
Senior ;S'taﬁ” I1/riter

It’s strange to look at Metallica as they
stand today. Graying, poorly dressed
and on their third bassist, the metal
gods have gotten old.

The fact that Metallica hasn’t faded
to obscurity after a 23-year lapse in
quality is a testament to how beloved
it is within the musical pantheon. To put
things in perspective, “Enter Sandman”
predates Justin Bieber’s very existence
by close to three years.

The years since the release ofits wa-
tershed self—titled album in 1991 have
seen the band fail in new and spectacu-
lar ways. Apart from “Fuel,” Load (1996)
and Reload (1997) were dreadful, aban-
doning the band’s thrash metal roots
completely in favor of a more chart-

to be improving, the band dropped Lulu
in 2011, a collaborative album with Lou
Reed that was, in a word, weird — and
not in a good way.

This comingjuly marks the 30th an-
niversary of 1984’s Ride the Lightning, a
masterwork monument to thrash metal
and unbridled boyish energy. In the fad-
ing Metallica catalog, Ride the Lightning
is often thought of as the album before
the venerable Master ofPuppets (1986)
rather than as a truly stand-alone re-
cord. While it lacks the slick production

ning possesses that joyful touch of ama-
teurism that made ‘80s thrash metal so
good. Metallica consisted of men on a
mission with Master of Puppets, making
it, from a technical standpoint, a better
album than its predecessor. But music is
not objective, and Ride the Lightning is
just more fun, making it one of the most
important thrash albums ever.

This is not, however, to impugn
Master ofPuppets, a truly wonderful
album whose title track is the undis-
puted thrash metal anthem. Rather, it

pets built on the massive leap taken
between Kill ‘Em All (1983) and Ride
the Lightning, stripping it of its inno-
cence but dragging it into adulthood
and allowing the band to conquer the
musical world. It can’t be overstated
that Metallica achieved real commercial
success while being one of the heavi-
est acts around. Master ofPuppets,
sold 300,000 copies in its first three
weeks. Since then, it has been certified
6x platinum by the Recording Industry
Association of America.

 Andjusticefor All (1988) under-
standably took on a more melancholic
tone after the death of bassist Cliff Bur-
ton, but still made sense in the con-
text of the band’s earlier work. Then,
Metallica (1991) took the band in an
entirely new direction — one that, ini-
tially, brought it immense commercial
success but has also made it something
of a cautionary tale in the heavy metal
world.

The lesson to learn is an uncom-
forfable one, worsening the tension
between artistic sensibilities and com-
mercial success. It’s that sometimes,
trying something new is a really bad
idea. It can make a musician rich but
can also make the fans who loved them
most turn their backs.

Th'at said, there is a happy, lesson
within the larger and more disheart-
ening one. During their ‘80s heyday,

, Metallica proved that bands can be in-

credibly popular and successful while
staying true to themselves and main-
taining musical integrity. Perhaps more
importantly, its example goes to show
that any art form has potential to sell if
it’s executed well e ugh. There should
be more than a few people who find that

Potential rule
changes go  
against Pitt style

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staﬁ” Wrz'ter

Longbefore Georgetown and Oregon tipped
off in South Korea to start the 2013-14 men’s
college basketball season, the NCAA basket-
ball rules committee made amendments to
three primary rules.

The changes limited hand-checking on
defense, granted offensive players with more
leeway in block—or—charge situations and fa-
vored an offensive player’s ability to move
without the ball. As a result, scoring and ﬁeld

‘ goal percentage increased in-the NCAA-Tour-

nament-, and year-long increases were seen in
attempted free throws, ﬁeld goal percentage
and 3-point shot percentage. \

We’re now eight months removed from
the committee’s offseason decisions, and
the committee, run by head coaches, is again
seeking to change the game. _

The committee met with a handﬁil of me-
dia members last week in Dallas, and many
presumed that theyear-old foul rules and

their results would dominate the discussion. V

This was not the case.

Instead, committee members addressed
rules that officials could enforce in the game
in the near future, asserting their opinions
on each possibility.

If all the proposed rules are ever admin-
istered into gameplay, the result would be
detrimental to Pitt coachjamie Dixon’s pat-
ented slow—paced, defensive-oriented style
of basketball.

Of the possibilities, the ﬁrst that struck me

' as a Pitt—killer is the proposal to widen the key.

No dimensions were revealed, but I as-
sume that if the court were to adopt a wider
lane, the NCAA would meet the NBA’s dimen-
sions of 16 feet. Keys in college basketball are

Pitt aims to snap cold streak, host Penguins

Dan Sostek
Stcyjf Writer

There is something about Youngstown

State’s baseball team.

The Penguins, for whatever reason,

have coaxed the best and the worst out ,

of Pitt thisseason. On March 18, with
the Panthers coming off a 3“-game sweep
at Virginia Tech, Youngstown State vis-
ited Charles L. Cost Field." I

Pitt cruisedto a 12-1 ‘victory over the
Penguins and proceeded to win its next
four contests and seven of the following
nine games, both of which still mark
season-best stretches.

Of course, right after Pitt’s loss at
Home against West Virginia, the Pan-
thers lost 7-6 on April 2 at Youngstown
State. Then they dropped six of their
next seven games.: ‘ _ T .

Now the ice-cold Panthers return

home to Charles L. Cost Field this af- P

ternoon at 3 p.m., having lost eight of
their last nine games —-including the
consecutive defeats against West Vir-
ginia and Youngstown State — looking
to once again right the ship against the
Penguins._

Pitt (16-19, _8-10 Atlantic Coast Con-

ference) hasdalready eclipsedlcits floss .

total from all of last year, when it posted
an impressive 42-17 record, and the
team’s next loss would mark the pro-
gram’s third 20—loss season in the past
five years. While that statistic seems
inevitable, the Panthers would love to
delay it as long as possible, and at least
past Tuesday afternoon.

While no announcement has been
made, expect freshman T]. Zeuch to take
his turn on the mound against the lowly
Penguins (6-23, 1-7 Horizon League),
whose dismal season includes a 2-17
record on the road. 1

The Penguins have hit a total of ﬁve
home runs, with senior inﬁelder Phil Li-
pari leading the way with three. Fresh-
man utility player Alex Larivee leads the
Penguins in batting with a .333 average,

TJ Zeuch has posted a 2.68 ERA in 26 2/3 innings. Heather Tennant| Staff Photographer

a mark that would be tops among Pitt’s
batters as well.

But recently, the Panthers have
shown that that doesn’t mean much.

They suffered a ‘second consecutive
sweep on the road against an ACC op-
ponent, this time at the hands of the
University of Miami Hurricanes. The
series in South Beach, which was seen
as a chance for the Panthers to gain
some much needed ground in the con-
ference’s Coastal Division standings,

did not go Pitt’s way. The Hurricanes’ .

pitching staff stymied Pitt’s offense,

which scored a total of four runs in the
three game series at Alex Rodriguez
Park-

But the Panthers’ bats have been
dormant long before their trip to the
Sunshine State, as the team has failed
to score more than six runs in a game
since March 22 against Duke.

The batters will get their chance
against a weak Penguins’ pitching staff,
which doesn’t have a pitcher with both
three or more starts and ERA under

currently 12 feet wide. This, in turn, would
bring on more slashing movesto the hoop
by guards and less body—banging on rebound
opportunities.

In bothcases, Pitt would suffer.

Dixon traditionally recruits guards who
are mid—range shooting artists, but who lack
the ability to bulldoze their way to the rim.
His teams also pride themselves on strong
interior rebounding. Last season, Pitt’ﬁn—
ished 21st among NCAA Division I teams in
offensive rebounding efﬁciency, grabbing a
staggering 37. 3 percent of offensive boards,
according to KenPom.com. F

Additionally, a wider key would pave a
wider path for teams with athletic swing-
men to score more easily because players
who proﬁle like Talib Zanna, Pitt’s center
this past season, may be positioned farther
from the hoop, making it more difﬁcult to

provide help—side defense.

The idea would also force teams into
having more dimensional rebounding.
Zanna’s 8.6 rebounds per game, which tied
for third best in the ACC in 2013-14, might
have dropped to 6.8 as a result.

A second changewhich, if put into effect,
could legitimately cause Dixon to lose some
sleep is reducing the number of timeouts.

Dixon loves his timeouts. Rarely has a
recent game gone by in which Dixon and the
Panthers had timeouts left in their pocket.

Dixon epitomized this strategy March 1,
when he elected to call a timeout with Lamar
Patterson en-route to a game—winning, right-
handed layup with 2.7 seconds left in a game
at Notre Dame.

Dixon had just called a timeout ﬁve sec-
onds earlier, too. ,

Limiting timeouts would certainly cripple
his ability to execute his game plan, but self-
declared “fan coaches” certainly would not
mind. Dixon’s critics often believe better

success would come if he provided his squads
with less micromanagement and more free-
lancing opportunities.

The committee also discussed an idea
that would continue offensive teams’ 10-sec-
ond backcourt allotments out of timeouts
rather than resetting the clock, which could
only hurt Dixon’s teams, since he only shows
ﬁ1ll~court presses when losing in late-game
situations.

Even coaches who opt to throw full-court
presses against Dixon’s teams to disrupt their
early movement would ﬁnd success in that
route. The concept is a lose—lose situation
for Pitt. I

, Sure, these ideas might hurt Dixon’s sys-
tem, but the fourth and ﬁnal concept that
stuck out —— reducing the shot clock — would
kill his chances of succeeding.

Committee members addressed a ﬁve-
second cut, which would bring the shot clock
down to 30 seconds.

The implementation of this rule would
give coaches like Dixon, such as George-

town’sJohn Thompson III and Virg1'nia’s Tony
Bennett ,face two options: adjust their late-
shot clock systems or surrender their jobs
and coach high school teams.

Last season, the Panthers used up 19.1
seconds per possession and came 286th
in average possession length according to
KenPom.com. ’

BYU ﬁnished ﬁrst — or last, depending
on how you value patience — as it spent
just 13.9 seconds per possession looking for
a shot.

This means that, with his current offense,
Dixon’s teams would get a shot up every 24
seconds. And without a late-in—the—clock
playmaker capable of getting a basket in ﬁve
seconds, his offense would crumble.

Certainly, it’s hard to speculate whether
these hypotheticals could ever become re-
ality.

But the meetingwas reportedly not let out
until one committee member, Art Hyland,
who is currently the secretary—rules editor for
the NCAA men’s basketball rules committee,
glanced across the table with a stern look.

“We’re not done,” he said.
