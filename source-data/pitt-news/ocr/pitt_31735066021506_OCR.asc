UPMC officials say Cowell bill will hurt research

By Chris Koberlein
For T be Pitt News

I

Pitt medical center officials and v

professors said the Cowellbill is
not the best way to open records
to the public because it would
interfere with university
operations.

Thomas Detre, president of the
University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center, said he can appreciate
the commonwealth’s desire for
accountability, but there should
be a balance between what will
benefit the university and what
the commonwealth wants to
know. -

The principle of opening
records to the public is fine, but
the bill should be implemented
to prevent public scrutiny from
hindering the functions of the
university, Detre said.

' All information in researchers’

contracts, such as the length and ‘
terms of the contract, becomes ._

- /

available once the contract is
written, according to Detre. Public
knowledge of these contracts
could disrupt negotiations, he
said.

“The time has come for a quiet
discussion of the pros and cons.

.It cannot be settled through

publicity and the media,” Detre
said.

Jeffrey Romoff, the vice
president of health sciences, said
he agrees with Pitt President J.
Dennis'O’Connor that the bill
would hurt research. O’Connor
“has expressed the opinion of the
majority of the faculty,” according
to Romoff.

Associate Provost for Research
Wilfried Daehnick said, “It
depends when the information is
made public. The question is
when and how many details to
provide.”

Although research details aren't
made available to the general
public, they are made available

to state and government auditing
agencies, he said. '

It is important for the university
to be up front with how money is
being spent on research projects,
he said. But the information must
be made available in an orderly
fashion, he said.

Daehnick’s main fear is that if
the bill is passed, anybody “off
the street” can demand
information on research projects
and their cost. It would be costly
and time-consuming for this
information to be given on
request, he said.

Daehnick said he doesn’t want
Pitt to be an information center
rather than a research center.

The bill could lead to a
bu_reaucracy to meet the public’s
demands, which could prove
costly for Pitt, he said.

Youngest transplant

Byjackie Estkowski
Staﬂ" Writer A

The youngest heart transplant
recipient in the world, 25~day—
old Sarah Kelton, was slowly
weaned off her respirator
yesterday afternoon.

Children’s Hospital of
Pittsburgh spokesperson Toby
Trosky said this was a big step for
Kelton, but the infant may have
to go back on the respirator.

“lt_’s not unusual, though, for a
heart transplant recipient to go
back on for brief periods, but the
doctors didn’t have to dothat to
Sarah yet,” T rosky said.

Kelton is now under an oxygen
tent for an indefinite amount of
time to help her breathe.

“The doctors are cautiously
optimistic about her condition,”
Trosky said. “They will be
watching her very closely.”

Kelton’s sternum has been
closed for a few days, and she

-When Nicaraguan police

‘stopped political poet Gioconda

Belli, she thought she was going
to be arrested for a trafﬁc violation.
“But when they saw the picture
on my license, they said, ‘Oh,
you're the poet!” Belli said in a
“conversation” with University of

9 Pittsburgh students yesterday.

“Nicaragua is the paradise of
poets. People are proud of their
literary figures. They’re our
celebrities.”

Belli, who was exiled from
Nicaragua for three years because
of her ties to the National
Liberation Front, said poetry has
a significance in Nicaragua that it
lacks in the United States.

“When I conduct a poetry
reading, the auditoriums are
packed. Soldiers, people from
-the street, everybody is there.
The people love poetry;

i Everybody has their own poem,
W and sometimes they bring them

up to you afterwards so you can
have a look at them. It’s like a
national sport."

But television takes the place
of poetry in the United States, she
said.

“Television is the opiate of the
masses. We are being stupidified
by this box in our living rooms. It
is very sad.”

Belli said political poetry reflects
“the longing for utopia that exists
in every human heart.”

 

“[Political poems] are an act of

faith and hope. I've never read a
political poem that was
completely desperate,” she said.

She has published two novels

)

and five books of poetry, V
including the Casas de Las
Americas prize-winning poetry
compilation, Line of Fire.

Political poetry could be the
ultimate tool of political change,
she said.

“If we were able to
communicate, war wouldn't be
necessary,” Belli said.

Nicaraguan ‘poetry is unique
because it embodies the real-life
experiences of the poet and
because it compares political
struggles to “epic quests.”

“There is [a] heroic air to our
poetry that comes from being an
active participant, a combatant.
Our dictators are like dragons 
The poets are the white knights’
fighting for a better world," she
said. ‘

The poet, who held a job in the
Nicaraguan bureaucracy before
beginning to write seriously,
realized that her poetry was
needed. “What I was doing,
anybody could do. What I could
write, nobody else could write.”

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, October 3, 1991

Belli believes the greatest poetry
survives the passage of years and
makes timeless statements about
human existence.

“This is what makes writing’

good political poetry so difficult.

The subjects are very urgent, very _ A

pressing. One must try to
transcend that immediacy by
reﬂecting on human feelings."

Belli worries that because
Middle Eastern issues grabbed
the world’s attention, Latin
American issues will lose their
importance in- the eyes of the
West. 7

‘‘We’re going to be the losers in
all of this,” Belli said.

Belli’s talk was supplemented
by a reading of her poetry later
yesterday evening. She will serve
as keynote speaker at the Hispanic
Literature Conference to be held
this weekend at Indiana University
of Pennsylvania.

_The event was sponsored by
the Latin American Studies
Association, thel-Ionors College
and the department of English.

Bush .
Continued from page 1
congratulating local Cub Scouts
Edward and Michael Stabile for
their “first-rate job” in leading the
audience through the Pledge of

Allegiance.

Bush expressed his reluctance
to see Thornburgh leave his
position as U.S. attorney general
but said he is looking forward to

“seeing Thornburgh back on

Capitol Hill as the next senator
from Pennsylvania.

Bush marvelled at the
accomplishments of Pittsburgh.
“What is it about Pittsburgh? What

is it about the water? The Steelers, I

the Penguins, the Pirates and
now Dick Thornburgh. You are
all blessed, and I hope you know
it,” Bush said.

Thornburgh “is a leader the
voters across this state already
know and trust,” Bush said. _

He considers T hornburgh a
good candidate for the Senate
because “itwould be great to
have a Pennsylvania senator who
is familiar with the national-
security requirements of the
United States of America, and
Dick has personally dealt with so
many foreign leaders.”

Thornburgh and Bush have
made several trips to the Soviet
Union in recent months to help
the Soviet government work
toward establishing democracy.

“The [United States] has stood

, steadfast for democracy and

always will,” the president said,
as he pounded his fist on the
podium. : '1

Bush‘ said Thornburgh led the *

campaign in ‘devising the
proposed Republican anti-crime
bill.  A ‘

“As the nation’s chief law
enforcement ofﬁcer, Dick led the
fight against crime, and under his
leadership we proposed the most
comprehensive crime package in
American history.

/ “It is time to get violence and

drugs out of our neighborhoods,
out of our workplaces and out of
our schools I am more
convinced than ever [that] we can
win this war against drugs, and
when we do, great credit should
go to Dick Thornburgh and the
state of Pennsylvania," said the
president.

Bush highlighted ’Ihornburgh’s ,

accomplishments as governor.

The president said that when
Thornburgh took office as
governor, Pennsylvania's
unemployment rate was among
the 10 highest in the nation and
had dropped to among the 10
lowest when he left office.

The state’s deficit had also
turned into surpluses, “something
of a contrast at what we are
seeing recently,” Bush said. v

“We need more Republicans in‘
the Senate,” Bush said. “So I'll just
simply say to all of you, just keep
up the ﬁght. [Thornburghl has
the strength he has earned and
deserved. Send me this great man,
and help our cause in
Washington, D.C.” 1

State and national political
figures praised Thornburgh for
his work and dedication to
Pennsylvania.

Republican National Committee

member Elsie Hillman said, “We
respect Dick for his competence
and commitment as a public
servant. [He has] served with
diligence and distinction.”

Hillman went on to praise
George Bush, “a man I truly
believe is my friend."

Hillman welcomed
Thornburgh, a native of
Pittsburgh, as “someone who will
rise again" -in Pennsylvania
politics.

If elected, Thornburgh will join
other Pennsylvania Republicans
including Sen. Arlen Specter and
congressional representatives
Tom Ridge and local Pittsburgher
Rick Santorum, all of whom
attended the luncheon.

' Santorum said “having a senator
from western Pennsylvania helps
the rest of us.‘ With the loss of
John Heinz, this state needs

someone with the experience of
Dick’ Thornburgh, who has
already developed great working

"relationships with other delegates

from the Commonwealth. Arlen

Specter knows the other side [of
the state], while Thornburgh

knows this side — not to say that
they both don’t know the issues
affecting the whole
Commonwealth.” _

A Republican—in—training Colleen
McDonugh attended the luncheon
as an early gift from her father for
her 10th birthday. ’ «

McDonugh met the president
and had her photo taken with
Bush. She glowed all afternoon in
the wake of Bush’s remark: “You
look pretty today.”

Also present at the fund raiser
was former Pitt President Wesley
Posvar, who said he is enjoying
his retirement. “[Butl I’ve been

very busy with my international
duties. I’ll be goingto Europe

 Government efforts to halt the
dmg trade cannot succeed, said
Buckley, the founder of the right-
wing National Review magazine.
The $20 million spent in the failed
“war on drugs” should be spent
on education about drug abuse
instead, he said.

Futile efforts to control ' dmg
use in tlie United States has stalled
American politics to the point
where the 1988 presidential race

was reduced to a contest of “which '

of the two candidates hated drugs
the most," according to Buckley.
A He said the legalization of drugs
would limit drug-related crime,
which increases along with the
price of drugs.
Legalization is the only
alternative to “living in a despotic
society" such as Singapore or

Malaysia, where drug use is
punishable by death, he said.

Buckley, 65, also offered his
opinions on the “politically
correct” movement, which seeks
to integrate multiculturalism into
college curriculurns, outlaw “hate
speech” and stop the use of
“sexist” terms such as “chairman”
and “policeman.”

The PC movement is dominated
by “people who occupy positions
of prestige  and make fools of
themselves,” Buckley said.

He said a college in New
Hampshire had recently voted to
punish people who use the word
“freshman.”

The alternative, “freshperson”
was “grating to the ear” as well as
being a ridiculous word, he
said.

Women should not be

concerned with eliminating
gender-designating language,
according to Buckley.

“When you go to lengths of
that kind, you have become a
caricature of yourself."

Buckley said PC supporters
don’t realize that everyone is not
offended by the same things.

Consequently, ‘it becomes,

difficult to enforce vague laws
prohibiting offensive speech and
actions, he said.

“Nobody has succeeded in
drawing an entirely plausible line
between your and my rights under
the First Amendment,” he said.

The zeal of the PC movement
can backfire. “If people become
obsessive about it, there’s a revolt
against it  [The issue] is_ only
resolvable by an appeal to good
nature and intelligence.”

Buckley discussed the
upcoming presidential election
and criticized allowing all citizens
over 21 to vote.

He said everyone should be
protected under the law, but only

_the well—informed should be

allowed to cast ballots.

He cited statistics that one-
quarter of first-year college
students in Texas could not
identify Mexico. These people
should not be allowed to vote,
Buckley said.

But he stressed he did not
advocate a government by the
elite, saying he would rather have
“the country ruled by the first
2,000 people in the Boston
telephone book than the entire
faculty of Harvard University."

He said he did not expect the
Roe vs. Wade decision ‘to be
outlawed soon.

To‘ be successful in making
abortion illegal, the pro—life
movement should concentrate on
getting the fetus declared a citizen,
Buckley said.

-He criticized the American
public’s reliance on the Supreme
Court as an “ultimate moral
tribunal.” He related an anecdote
where a man wouldn’t say how
he felt about forced busing “until
the Supreme Court ruled on it.”

In a press conference before

the speech, Buckley said his
endorsement of tattooing people
who are HIV-positive was only
intended to stop the spread of the
disease, not to stigmatize people
with AIDS.

“When people think of
tattooing, they think of
Auschwitz,” he said.

He supports President Bush's
proposed cuts in the nuclear
arsenal but thinks more money
should be spent on the Strategic
Defense Initiative, also known as
“Star Wars." '

Buckley, a
commentator and columnist, has
also written detective novels and
books about sailing and travel..

His long-running television
program, “On the Firing Line,"
interviews national newsmakers
and politicians. A 4

The speech was sponsored by
the Pitt Program Council. V

PPC lecture director Joanne
Fiamma said it cost between
$10,000 and $15,000 to bring
Buckley to Pitt.

where the resources are being
allocated, according to Daehnick.

“There are certain things the
public should know about
because they are taxpayers," said
Todd Evans, an assistant professor
of biology.

Evans said some research at
Pitt could have been made public,
but it has always been “up to the
administration, ” and he was in no
position “to make those kinds of
decisions.”

Political science Professor Irwin
Schulman said he wants to see
average salaries of professors

instead of exact salaries and
names.

Schulman said publishing the
details of research contracts would
eventually cost the university
more money. Contractors might
not be willing to sell or publish
the lower prices they are giving
the university because other
clients would want the same price,
he said.

Schulman said he doesn't want
the bill to “lump [Pitt] together
with other state agencies,” and it
wouldeventually not be treated
like a university.

According to Schulman, it is in

the public’s best interest to see
where their money is going as
taxpayers and to see where the
students’ money is being spent.
But the Cowell bill would open

the university to scrutiny that‘

could interfere with its operations,
he said.

The Cowell bill, which was
proposed by State Rep. ‘Ron
Cowell (D-Wilkins), would
amend the state Right to Know

Act of 1957 and make public —
financial records and research ,

projects of the four state-
associated universities: Pitt,
Temple, Penn State and Lincoln.

 jCKeeping the records shut

‘I The Cowell bill, which is stalled in the state senate,

 iwould open the ﬁnancial records of Pitt and other state
?universities in Pennsylvania.

Last month, when Pitt President J. Dennis O’Connor

‘publicized his opinion of the Cowell Bill, the university
community was shocked that O’Connor was denying us
. the “new era of openness” we were promised.

I The latest (and not very surprising) blow came from

,, other high-ranking university officials yesterday: They,
too, do not agree that Pitt’s records should be public

knowledge.
Thomas Detre, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center

~ president, Jeffery Romoff, vice president of health sciences

and Associate Provost for Research Wilifried Daehnick
believe that Pitt’s financial dealings should be closed to

‘the public.

The basic fact is that most of the public would not be
interested in all of Pitt’s finances and research. The press,

I ‘however, would be.

Where research money goes must be public knowledge.
If the government had not decided to investigate Pitt
earlier this summer, it is possible no one but those
involved would know about Pitt’s $259,089 unjustified
allocation of funding. A

Todd Evans, an assistant professor of biology, said,
“There are certain things the -public should know about
because they are taxpayers.” Certain things, yes. Everything,
definitely. t‘ . f '

L? Pitt is handed thousands of dollars for research every

.  by the government. This money’s purpose is ‘solely

that — research. Unfortunately those funds aren’t always
used for that purpose.»  1 g _ .
 Pitt" has=.sperit research -  5n*eyr.on ‘stationary, vacations,
food and other questionable items in the past few years.
Without the Cowell bill, these expenditures will not be
made public knowledge in the future.

The University of Pittsburgh has an obligation to the
students and faculty who support it. Lavish expenditures

and rnisallocation of research funding must be stopped,

but without the threat of public knowledge of all
transactions looming over administrators,‘ these

Pitt should be a research center and not an information
center, Daehnick said. That is correct, but it should not be

_ a spending center, either — as-the government investigation

proved it has been.

Some believe that the opening of Pitt’s records would
open the university to unnecessary scrutiny that would
interfere with Pitt’s operation as a university.

Assuming Pitt has been run “like a university” in the past

few years, this observation would be true. However all

evidence points to the fact that Pitt has slowly but surely
become a business. The approval of the Cowell bill will

- not only terminate the ‘recent adrninistration’s behavior,

but it will also prevent Pitt from allowing the
misappropriation of funds again.

Miles Davis, the innovator of jazz

Miles Davis died. It’s a funny
thing about jazz musicians: When
a great one like Miles dies, we
always mourn what could have
been." No matter how old Miles
was, he was going‘-to do} more.
You knew that. I '

“rI,can’t, recall the first time I

heard Miles, but he was the kind _,

of musician I wanted to be. I took
up the trumpet for no particular
I‘C3'_SQl'l—’l1_l'1[ll It hea_r_d‘Miles..I do
remember, the particular album,

Kind ofBlue. It will remain on the '

list of my favorite albums. When
I was young, I didn’t realize how
important the musical directions
on that recording were: the

modality, the expanded role of,
the piano and bass. I just thou ght”

that this was what music. was
supposed to be: the emotion, the
peaks and valleys, the lyricism.
There aren’t many people who
could “tell" the story of a song
like Miles could.

I quickly realized that I was not
Miles Davis, nor even close, as far
as talent and skill went. But I will
never stop listening, trying to
guess his next move in a solo or
wondering why he followed one

Derek .
Wﬂlis
way instead of another in a song.
That’s- the beauty of jazz and of
Miles: unpredictability.
Miles was s‘uc..h,a;1e.ad:=:r.  sq
many types of jazz. He was bop,

. cool, avant-garde, fusion, electric,
‘everything. His presence and
_ guidai§1ce—left us with such diverse}

‘musicians as Chick Corea, John
McLaughlin, Herbie Hancock and
Wayne Shorter. Like many jazz

Wgreats, he willingly brought

younger players ‘into his life,

_.teaching them and giving a gift

that was so rare,

If you listen to, say, John
Coltrane’s recordings with Miles,
you can easily recognize ‘T rane
as a talented but raw saxophonist

After he went out on his own,
Coltrane paid tribute to his former
mate — as so many musicians do
—by being a leader and innovator
himself.

Innovation is an important word
in jazz, but sometimes it is

~overused. There are very few real

innovators, and of course Miles
was one of them. I don't know
how many times I bugged my
mother to buy me a mute because
Miles’ sound was so neat. ’

That’s’ the real sound of Miles,
to me,.'Ihankfully there are many
examples ofhis ‘work left for us.
But favorite way of listening
to Miles, was when I.w_a_s down or _
tired on 1a“ humid August night 
with Miles,’ soft but sharp muted i
sound wafting on ..the air. = .. . .. _-, 

The blues has many forms, but I
I like Miles’ way the best A ' " ;

I never met Miles (I saw him
once), and I feel the worse’ for
not having the chance. But I am
thankful that I can almost know
him, whenever I want, just by
slipping in a tape. 1

I can hear him in all kinds of §
ways, from his frenzied bop to 
his airy coolness to his sorrowful :
ballads. §

I have an album of_his called -0%
Miles Smiles. I sure hope he is
smiling, because he brought so



much joy to me.

BiGALA responds to ‘incident’

We would like to respond‘ to the recent Pitt News
coverage of the harassment incident between
members of BiGALA and a member of the College
Republicans. We feel that the tone of the Sept. 26
article implied that this incident was part of a

conﬂict between BiGALA and the
College Republicans. [.. .lBiGALA,
as an organization, was not
involved in the incident, and it is

not part of an attack on the College Republicans.
The incident occurred between individuals, some
of whom are involved with BiGALA, and an
individual who is a member of the College
Republicans. Any statements that this incident is an
attack on the College Republicans by BiGALA are
false. We feel that the incidentshould be resolved
by the individuals involved. It is our intent at
BiGALA to provide a safe atmosphere[...] We hope
that this letter clears up any misunderstandings that

may have occurred.

Letters

comprehend why we should allow criminals to
possess guns. The entire purpose of the Brady bill,
. [...] was to allow a seven—day waiting period before
the purchase of a handgun, in order to check the
buyer’s criminal record. Who can justify allowing
criminals to just walk in a store and leave with the
purchase of a new gun? I also believe that high-
powered assault weapons should be outlawed. [...l
Finally I ﬁnd it outrageous that gun-control
advocates are accused of restricting the Bill of

Brady bill necessary

Regarding Gary Houston’s article “Gun "control
laws not necessary" on Sept. 26, I feel the opinions
of gun-control advocates should be fairly 
represented. [...] I also believe that law-abiding

persons have the right to keep
and bear arms, as guaranteed by
the Second Amendment.
However I find it hard to

article, “Let’s do away with today's lenient, slow- i

Coen Brothers create another classic in Barton Fink

By Rob Penman
Stajf Writer

About a week ago I was on a field study
to the Midwest, a place where the earth is

ﬂat, professional basketball players have

warlord status and a farm—fed breakfast is
the order of the day. One of the highlights

of the study was my viewing of the Coen V

brothers’ latest film, Barton Fink. For
starters, I’d like to preface this by saying
that after four plus years here, and one at
another university-(which is also in the
Midwest), I can chat it up. But when I
choose a film, I’m looking for the blowup.
That is my primary interest in the cinema:
who and what blows up, and with what
frequency; replicants, a private dick’s
alienation from modern life, Brando's
insistence that a small backwater has to
bop  that’s-what I like. Barton Finle
definitely falls into this category, but the
blowup is within the internal landscape of
nightmares, hate-frenzied dismemberrnent

fantasies and peoples spiritually unrnored 
drifting thought the Americarfdepression ’

of the 19405. . _
Speakin-g of the ’4_Os, it's been less” than

a year: since the"C'oe‘:n brothers, Joel 

director and Ethan the producer, released

MiZler’s Crossing. Here one sees ‘the’ F’
struggles of the Irish, Ita1ian"and'JewishT-‘

mobs in a big, ﬁlm—noir metro, presumably‘

Chicago. The _film_is an excellelntstudy for ‘

any anthropologist in its p'r'ooiog* the
loyalties, politics and motivations of human

behavior, from the running of a city to the}
complications of intimate relationships. . .

‘ Then there’s Blood Simple, the best of A
the Coen genius." Beginning with the"
panning’, _o_f_ vast”_Texas:foil. __ﬁeldslan'd E; H

Emmet ‘\_7fialsh:_s solilo “I"don’t care if

   

.you’re the Pope of Rome, president of

Europe, Man of the Year  something can
always go wrong. No guarantee.”

One is propelled into a world as isolated
and desolate as the state itself (last count
has over 17 time zones), where in order to
survive the cast must plot out each other’s
destruction. By ‘the end, your mind is
orbiting Orion’s belt, psychologically
parsecs away from the rights and wrongs
you were toldas a little one.

Back to Firile. Fink, played by John
Turturro, is like many of us here in the big
one of learning. He has a utopian vision
for us all — a vision where each of us can
stand up and be counted. And as high
falutin’ Manhattan playwright Fink sets
out to do it on Broadway, in fashion very
similarto Clifford Qddets, who spieled his
way thr_ough the ,’40s as a true—to-life,
socially—conscious. liberal.

' A From’ the pit of hisgut, Fink feels that the
toils of kings, and ‘queens are an

overexposed literary theme; furthermore

the "average stiff _‘,(like myself) has _little

‘ inte"'rest"'in such strife. Good point. But

from there he takes it one step further, he
envisions himself as the fountainhead of

7-an entirely new theater, a theater that

wholeheartedlylmirrors the passion of the
common man. It’s atough call and a very
tough move to u,jpr_oot,ari upper east, '70s,
sl'1irt—and—tie guy and dive into a world of

grotgut hooch and lice. , -'

But this is what Ba”-rton valiantly does.

,He checks into hotel Styx with the hopes
I of- fine-tuning; his vision via some
‘sightseeing.

Taking the advice of a fellow scotch-

_.’_an'_d4water chum,_ Fink, heads wesyto
Hollywood so hefcan A) Establish" more

-.: -. r-:\I~/. 

screenplays for the "pictures (or pikchas.
As in other Coen flims, we see the full
employment of vernacular of the day) and
B) get that first-hand experience of the
working class by living with and writing
quality, B-wrestling pickchas (if there is
such an animal) for them. _

Upon arriving on the west coast, Fink’s
very fragile, ivy—covered, wa11ed—in psyche
has holes smashed in it. One of the chief
hole-bashers is Jack Lipnik, the mercurial
head of Capitol pickchas, a regular “get-it-
done-last-week, gold—trimmed caddie,
who-loves-you—baby," whack.

Although he had dismissed Fink’s
playwriting as kinda fruity, Lipnick wholly
embraces Fink as the man who will produce
volumes for Capitol, insisting that he gives
that Barton/Fink feeling to Capitol
pickchas. .

Next we see Finkchecking in at his self- ’

chosen slice of art—deco hell. Enter a
I down—on-his-luck," permanent resident of
hotel lonely, John Goodman, who shares
I with Bartonhis troubles and worries.
In turn Barton spiels to him about a
, vision of a people’s theater and his own
anxieties, which he calls navigation of the
troubled waters of the mind. Each time
Fink brings up the notion of his revolution
of the theater, Goodman tries to impart his
own insight_ of being a product of the
unsung with the preamble, “I could tell
you stories“ _, _ V _..  '
But each time Fink cuts his spiel short.
, Fink would rather wax pale and half-

'ba_k_ed notions of who and what the

 working class is than stick to concrete

"empi»ri"cal>;_and emotive data from

«‘ }G_oodmanf§:1'ftestimony. Right within the
 3 hotel room Fink has a truly

c,irC1e's by writing“

tragic: ﬁgure‘— not classically, like Hamlet

or a character in a poem by Byron, but a
good old boy, shaman, trying to scratch
out a living within the conﬁnes of the
same art—deco inferno.

Changing focus to Coen brother-

filmmaking, like their other efforts the
Coens propel harpoons of horror at you
that produce wrenching winces within the
depths of your genitals. I _

For example, a scene where Barton
battles with his roommate, which happens
to be a mosquito; What starts out as a very
funny sight gag instantaneously transforms
into one of the sickest, cerebellum—
cauterizing images that would turn Travis
Bickle green. ‘ -

Fluids are another disturbing them‘e.:
Goodman suffers from a chronic ear
infection; the milky, lmolasses—textureed]

fluid drolls out of his ear straight on to}
your retinas. Another ﬂuid is the semené '

This movie is the first for

is more, digestible and
uplifting than Gilliam’s
norm. But the movie is
filled with little touches
of him, especially the
cinematography. The
shadowy backgrounds
and the images of decay
are powerful.

One scene, at a train
station, is pure Gilliam
brilliance. Parry follows
Lydia through a mass of
people who suddenly
start waltzing. It is an
eerily beautiful scene.
This is also the first time
Gilliam has had two
powerhouse Hollywood
actors in leading roles.
(Sean Connery and
Robert DeNiro did
cameos in earlier films.) The
character Parry, a semi—babbling
lunatic, seems to be made for

the idea "of friends/ partners who

it works nonetheless. It seems
thatjack is the protagonist of the
film, but Parry is the main
character.

Williams dominates the scenes
he is in and ﬁlls up the screen
with his exuberance. This is an
Oscar—quality performance.

Supporting actresses Plummer
and Mercedes Ruhl (who plays
Anne, Jack’s girlfriend), give
strong performances and even
steal a scene together. But some
of the most memorable scenes
are of the homeless people that
Parry hangs with. They have many
of the thought-provoking
moments. They contrast the
yuppies (“They don’t fall in love;
they only negotiate love
moments.”)

The Fisher King is a modern-

Gilliam’s direction and Williams’
acting leaves you feeling  I

worth watching more than once.

By Mike Shanley
Sta_[f Writer

For the past five years
California’s Trotsky Icepick has
been redeﬁning exactly what a
good pop band is — what a band
is, for that matter.

In 1986 guitarists Kjehl (rhymes
with hell) Johansen and Vitus
(rhymes with fetus) Matare got
together as an outlet for songs
they couldn’t play in current bands
(100 Flowers and the Last
respectively). When they got a
band together, their initial idea
was to change its name for each
show they played. The idea was
partly a joke and partly due to the
fact that they had trouble getting
shows. I

In keeping with that concept,
they released two albums in 1986,
each titled Poison Summer. One
was credited to Danny and the
Doorknobs; the other was by
Trotsky Icepick, despite the fact
that bothwere virtually the same
band. The second name
(musicians’ slang for ear—piercing
feedback) eventually stuck.

Unlike a lot of bands at that
time, which were happy jangling
around in REMvi1le, T rotsky/the
Doorknobs had songs that went
beyond standard college rock (if

that was even a relevant term at ,

that time).

They were a good combination
of Vitus’ pop hooks (carried over
from the garage rock he played
in the Last) and the driving
intensity that was part of 100
Flowers’ twisted pop punk.

On top of that, the band had
great witty lyrics. “Hit Parade,"
from the Trotsky album, tells the
tale of a guy who’s been dumped
by his girlfriend, left with nothing

but her album collection. “Her ‘

records are over at my place / I’m
gonna melt them down to
hairspray / the note she left me
said, ‘Dang’ / she didn’t have a lot
to say.”

But of course like all great
underground bands, few people

.; AA:-:-'.A 

fanzine circuit heard the good
words of Trotsky. The Poison
Summer albums ‘were both
released by the band on their
own small Old Scratch
Grammophone label.

Things took a change for the
better when SST signed the band
and released their next album,
Baby. 1

Changes in the lineup (John
Rosewall andJason Kahn became
the steady rhythm section)
solidiﬁed the band’s sound, which
can best be described as
aggressive pop. Songs like “A
Little Push at the Top of the
Stairs” were catchy with an
unnerving feel to them. Lyrically
Vitus railed on the government

(“Big Daddy,” which actually.

foretold the last election before it
happened), brainless club-goers
(“Bury Manilow”) and
commercialism (“Don’t Buy It”):
And the guitars sliced through at
you.

For 1989’s El Kabong former
100 Flowers memberJohn Talley-
Jones took over the vocal duties,
which really added to the band.
Jones’ lyrics and delivery seemed
to mix sensitivity with a feeling of
mental decay. On one hand there
are upbeat cuts like “Astronomer,”
about a guy who has designs on
a babe whose only interest is in
the stars (though he does get her
in the end),._.t..-.~. But then “ 106

To piafme pops  Tiiotsky Icepick

can’t tell if it's about death or
‘something less intense. The
album’s closer, “Say Goodnight,”

really ends things with a bang. In «

under two minutes we find our
protagonist framed for murder
by God, who tells him not to
worry because “The sun he made
won’t be coming out/ So saaaaay
goodnightll” Intense stuff and an
appropriate way to end the ’80s,
let me tell you.

C Trotsky Icepick’s newest

offering, The Ultraviolet
Catastrophe, just came out a few
months ago.

After all the force of El
Kahong, the new album sounds
surprisingly down—to-earth. Jones
doesn’t sound as deranged as
before. y

Despite this, there are still some
great moments to the album,
especially the title tune, which is
one of the most beautiful things
to come out all year. And the
dark humor and sarcasm still
abounds. Plus they’re still more
exciting than REM.

Trotsky Icepick is now in the

- middle of its first east—coast tour,

and they’re stopping in Pittsburgh
tonight at the Upstage. V

Also on the bill are locals Karl
Hendricks (recently of
Sludgehammer) and Bone of
Contention.
I Forget your Friday classes, and
come on out to The Upstage at

The kind of person that wouldn’t like Karl Hendrick’s I Hate,
This Party 7" is the same kind of person who won’t say “fuck”
in mixed company. In fairness to that type, I would ‘say;
Hendricks delivers a supremely upliﬂing manifesto to thepassions
of our lives. .

The spirit of this 7" hearkens back to when Sludgehammer
(Hendricks’ other vehicle) was copping Dinosaur instead of
Bitch Magnet. Although Hendricks can’t escape those damning
N. Young/ J. Mascis tags, he retains more originality and pure,
ballsy pluck than most local geek-rock efforts. '

Production on the four cuts is rough but couldn’t be otherwise.

I “Beergasm” and “She’s the Shit" are V8-soaked romps through

the kind of angst-ridden, teenage aches and pains that post-
puberty forgot. “Ride You Home” is lovesick pleading at its most
spoiled. All four songs have this bittersweet, nostalgic aftertaste
that is nowhere more heartbreaking than on the crooning “Fuck
Shit Up.” Calling up the pimply, mugged ghosts of alcohol and
adolescence, Hendricks does not fail to wrench a tear for those
bygone years. I v
Hendricks, as you may know, is The Sassiest Man in Rock and
Roll. His mere presence inspires goodwill to all, and “IHate This
Party’ is a take-home piece of that...um...swellness.
Hendricks plays with Bone of Contention and Trotsky Icepick
tonight at The Upstage...and wins!/

Whatever the case, it’s no secret

that advertisers believe in some '

mysterious connection between
our willingness to spend money
and our desire to get laid.
Unfortunately most American
advertisements that use sex as
their underlying (or overbearing)
sales pitch are completely based
in fantasyland.

What does that say for all of
you dorks out there with busty
Budweiser babes hanging on your
bedroom walls? ‘

Foreign advertisers, on the other
hand, appear to treat the subject
from a perspective based in
reality. Treat sex as the natural,

It is tough to absorb them all,

The No. 17 Pitt Panthers enter
this Saturday’s game against the
Maryland Terrapins hoping to
regain the momentum they lost
during their of_f—week. p

Last Saturday the Panthers
rolled into the Hubert H.
Humphrey Metrodome after

,_ taking one Saturday offand barely

escaped with a win to keep. their
undefeated record intact.

The offense never seemed to
get rolling against the Golden
Gophers. Every time they started
movingthe ball, something bad
happened.

Curtis Martin broke a long run
to move the ball into at least easy
field-goal position, but
quarterback Alex Van Pelt was
sacked and fumbled. Scott Kaplan
missed four ﬁeld goals and was
replaced on the Panthers’ last
extra-point attempt by Don
Silvestrl. .

The Panthers got inside the
Minnesota 20-yard line seven

"-1" 7+’-' :’,v-I —'-9'!‘-.~.~?«.‘%‘“ '

 

times and came away empty-
handed seven times. V
This performance came from
the same offense that averaged
31.7 points in its first three games
against Temple, Southern
Mississippi and West Virginia. It

ran at will over its opponents and I

had put the Panthers out of striking
distance for a comeback‘ by
halftime. ,

The one bright spot that came
from the Minnesota game was the

- emergence of first-year running

back [Curtis Martin. Martin gained
170 yards on 18 carries (most of
them coming in the second half)
and one touchdown. For that
performance he was named the
Chevrolet Player of the Game for
the Panthers.

The Panthers’ defense and
special teams continued to lead
the team and make the big play,
like Chris Hupko’s blocked punt
or Steve Israe1’s 40-yard punt
return. The defense last season
stopped opposing offenses like a
sieve stops water.

to a speedier team from
Oklahoma. _ .

They got burned for 45 points
by Erickson, McGuire and Co.,
from Miami, last year. They lost
to Temple at home and lost to
Penn State in Happy Valley.

This season, however, has been
different. Very different.

The linebacking corps, a serious
liability a year ago, has become
the leader of the Panthers’
defense.

Pitt’s highest recruit, Tom’

T umulty, from nearby Penn Hills
High School, has Panther fans
thinking back to an inside
linebacker named Olsavsky.
Tumulty leads the squad in

tackles with 44, including 15.

against Southern Mississippi. He
also made the first tackle of the
year for the Panthers playing in
his first collegiate down.

T umulty’s counterpart at inside
linebacker, sophomore Charles
Williams, has also become a team
leader. , '

Williams made 33 tackles while
playing in 11 games last season.
This year he has already made 35
tackles in four games. _

This Saturday will prove if the
Panthers can come back from a
tough game to win the following
week. A V

The contest at Pitt Stadium

, marks the ﬁfth time that the two

teams have met, with each team
winning two.

The last time these two squads
bashed heads was Labor Day
1986, when the Terrapins
defeated the Panthers 10-7 at Pitt
Stadium.

Maryland also won the meeting
prior to that, a 1983 13-7 Terrapin

‘ win in College Park, Md. The

series started in 1912, when Pitt
defeated Maryland 64-0.
Maryland enters this game 1-2
after three straight home contests
against Virginia, Syracuse and
West Virginia. They defeated the
Cavaliers 17-6 in their season
opener, then lost 31-17 to the

_ : Orangemen and 37-7 to the

- 13-Mountaineers. ‘Q

l -  This game marks the beginnin
. of a three-game road trip for the

Terrapins. After Pittsburgh, the
Terps travel to Atlanta, Ga., to
takevon Georgia Tech in an ACC
matchup. Then they go to
Winston-Salem, N.C., to face
Wake Forest. S

The 4-0 Panthers, on the other
hand, enter the toughest part of
their schedule.

After Maryland they travel to
South Bend for a game against
Notre Dame. Then they return
home for a Big East game against
Syracuse. _

Pitt’s record is its best start
since 1982, when the Panthers
won their first seven games before
losing to Notre Dame. The
Panthers finished that year 8-3
before losing to SMU in the Cotton
Bowl. The Panthers started out
1989 3-0 before ' tying West
Virginia 31-31.

If the Panthers defeat Maryland,
it will be the first time in many
years that they enter a game
against Notre Dame with a better
record. The Irish lost to Michigan
in their first game of the year.

Hamilton leading defensive cbozrgefor Pant/oers

By Rob Pugliese
Staﬁ" Writer

For Opposing offenses, Pitt
defensive end Keith Hamilton is
a time bomb waiting to explode.

At 6-feet, 7-inches tall and 290
pounds, Hamilton is an imposing
figure, ready to unleash a
combination of straight-ahead
power, quickness and Outside
speed possessed by only a select
few at any level of football.

“When you turn on the film
and watch Keith Hamilton

, playing, you have to get very
emotional,” said head coach Paul

Keith Hamilton is enjoying his best season as a Panther this year.

Hackett. “It’s awful exciting to
watch this man play football.”
The junior from Lynchburg,
VA.,is Off to his finest start as a
Panther, with 21 tackles, four
quarterback sacks and six tackles
for losses in only four games.
Last week Hamilton almost
single-handedly dominated the
line of scrimmage in Pitt’s 14-13
win over Minnesota. He made
eight tackles, -including two for
losses, and had another sack. His
constant pressure on elusive
quarterback Marquel Fleetwood
wreaked havoc in the Gopher
backfield.
Statistics do not begin to tell

the story for Hamilton’s efforts.
Hackett describes Hamilton’s play
thus far as “scintillating football."

He entered the season as a
first—team, preseason All-
American in many publications
and was regarded as one of the
most intimidating forces in college
football. In 1990 he led Pitt in
sacks for the second consecutive
season, with 9.5, and was named

-to Football W/eek1y’s sophomore ,

All-America team. As a first-year
player Hamilton arrived on the
national scene with nine sacks
and was named Freshman of the
Year by the Sporting News as
well as an honorable mention

All-American and ﬁrst—team All-
East by the Associated Press.

Hackett called Hamilton’s
impact on this team “dramatic.”
Many players have stepped up
their game a notch or two in Pitt’s
4-0 surge, and Hamilton has been
at the forefront, a leader that the
defense counts on every play.

f‘I think this team has a lot of
chemistry. We’re more cohesive
than at any time,” Hamilton said.
“There are no individuals on this
team. There are no stars on this
defense. I heard Steve Israel say,
‘It’s like one big machine.’"

Lately Hamilton has turned up
an already devastating game two
or three /levels, but he said that
his approach was simply to go
100 percentevery play, something
he was often criticized for not
doing last season.

“You're always going to have
criticism, but I just felt there was
some things I was going to. do
differently,” Hamilton said.

Hamilton will tell you that he
has yet_tO play his best football.
He was used primarily as a pass-

-,..,\.

 
  
   
 

rushing end in his first year and»
admittedly had some trouble
adjusting to his new role in -
defensive coordinator Fred’
vonAppen’s defense last season.
Now Hamilton is a more,’
complete player. He haslf
improved significantly versus the
run and feels that the Panther I
defenders have jelled due to a
better grasp of the system with "a .

, full year under their belts.

Pitt’s defensive line has always 
been laden with talent and ._ "
expectations, but it has rarely‘ f A
met expectations. According to  '
Hamilton, the difference this
season has been the new attitude
and work ethic.

“We've always had the talent,
but unless you go out and do the .
job, give 100 percenton every
play, it won’t get done,” he said.

After facing a mobile
quarterback like Fleetwood, _
Hamilton said thatjim Sandwisch.
and the Maryland offense will Q
present a different challenge.

“By no means can we look"

first Panther to compile a 100-
yard rushing performance since
Richards did it last year against
Oklahoma— a span of 11 games.

“It made me feel so much more
confident,” Martin said, referring
to his performance against
Minnesota. “It just feels good. It
feels so good, I didn’t know what
to do. I didn’t know how to react
to it.”

For his performance he was
named the Big East Offensive
Player of the Week.

“I never really expected it,” he
said. “I never expected to even
come to college and playfootball.
When I saw I'm Big East Player of
the Week, it was a big thrill for
me.” .

Unlike the majority of first-year

players, the 6-foot, 180-pound

tailback has been -getting the
opportunity to display his skills
early in his college career.

He’s making an impact on a
team that wasn’t expected to be
where it is: undefeated at 4-0 and
clinging to a Top 20 national
ranking. 1

Even though Martin has yet to
start a game, he’s still the team’s
leading ground-gainer, with 250

yards on 42 carries. He’s averaging
six yards a carry and has scored
two of Pitt’s four rushing
touchdowns this year.

Said Panther head coach Paul
Hackett, .“The thing about Curtis
is we never thought it would
happen so fast because we never
thought we’d have to play a
freshman. But what happened
was the opportunity presented
itself. I think he knew in recruiting
when Curvin [Richards] wasn’t
gonna be herethat the job was
going to be open, and Ivthink
what shocked us is how quickly
he has absorbed all the
information — not his skill as a
runner, his skill as a player; we
knew that. What we didn’t know
is how quickly he could learn all
the things we’ve given him and
take it out in the heat of the battle
and perform. And that’s the thing
that’s so exciting. Imagine, he’s
got three and a half more years.
It’s marvelous!"

As a high—school senior last
year, he stepped onto the football
field for the very first time and, in
11 games, rushed for 1,705 yards
on 229 carries and scored 20
touchdowns.

He earned ﬁrst-team All-State
honors and sparked the interest
of several of the nation’s top
programs.

Miami, Penn State, Georgia
Tech and Southern Cal all came
knocking on his door.

However when it was time to
decide on a college, he chose to
stay close to home. ~

“I always liked Pitt,” he said. 5‘If
I played college ball, this is where
I wanted to play.”

Playing football wasn’t always
on his mind though.

“I didn’t plan on playing at all
until my 11th grade year," Martin
said. “I sort of was tempted to
play by my mother and [other]
family members, and I got hurt
within two weeks, and I just
figured I'd give up on football. I
didn’t want to play anymore.”

But before his senior year began
his coach had a long talk with
him and convinced him’to give it
another shot.

Both were glad he did because
in four straight games he rushed
for over 200 yards. Not bad for
someone who had never even
played before.

“When we saw him play in
high school, we knew what he
could do,” Hackett said. Martin is
contributing to a Pitt backfield
that ‘was depleted by the loss of
Curvin Richards to the National
Football League and Ronald
Redmon to injury.

In the preseason, Glenn
Deveauxsand Jermaine Williams
emerged as the top contenders
for the starting tailback slot.

“He’s very fast,” said Pitt running
backs coach Skip Peete. “He has
the ability to run away from
people and runs extremely hard
for a guy his size.”

With that in mind, it's probably
safe to assume that he’ll be seeing
plenty of action throughout the
remainder of the season.

Martin is listed as the first-
string tailback for Pitt's game
against Maryland.

“I think that Curtis has a
tremendous future,” Hackettsaid.

The Pitt offense will be trying
to avoid a repeat performance
this week.

After an uncertain, ineffective
offense (the lone exception being
Curtis Martin) struggled in the
Metrodome, Pitt head coach Paul
Hackett faces another defense
which is tough against the pass:
the Maryland defense.

Laden with seniors and led by
a strong front line and a quick
secondary, the Terps have made
it difficult for opponents to pass
this season. They give up an
average of 172 yards in the air,
which is lower than Pitt’s stingy
mark of 175/yards.

Unfortunately the Terps are like

Minnesota in that they give up '-

extension

By Derek Willis
Asst. Sports Editor

University of Pittsburgh
basketball Coach Paul Evans
agreed to a new contract
extension yesterday, announced
athletic director Oval Jaynes.

Terms of the multi—year deal
were not disclosed.

Evans, 46, has an overall career
record of 344-167 (a winning
percentage of .673) in 18 years of

 collegiate coaching. His record at 
:_-.=-*-.-P.=itt' «.is&:-» 99- 5'7 ‘ ~(:6:55  awinning = —

percentage) in ﬁve years. Evans
has won more games in his first

five years than any other _
basketball coach ingPitt’s history. I '

«Evans was hired as Pitt’s 11th
coach on March 27, 1986, after a
six-year stint at Navy. His 1986
"Navy team, with Al1—American
David Robinson, advanced to the
NCAA East Regional Final. His
first two Pitt teams were Big East
regular-season champions. Pitt
has an overall conference record
of 51-38 during Evans’ tenure.

The Panthers have had three
20—win seasons under Evans,
including last year’s 21-12 mark.
The team also made four trips to
NCAA Tournament,
advancing to the second round in
1988, 1989 and 1991.

Evans began his coaching
career in 1973 at St. Lawrence
(N.Y.), where he coached for
seven years and won six
conference championships.

carry. In another similarity to Pitt’s
last" opponent, the defensive
backs are among the team leaders
in tackles.

One factor in Pitt’s favor is that
the Terrapins have given up 68
points in their last two games,
after holding Virginia to six in
their opener.

The leader up front is tackle
Larry Webster, a 6—foot, 5-inch,
268-pound senior, who is a four-
yearstarter. Webster has 16 tackles
(tops among the down linemen)
and one sack. Noseguard Ralph
Orta and right tackle Lubo
Zizakovic are also fifth-year
seniors. Zizakovic is an imposing
6-8 but has not been very effective
this year. “It’s no secret that we’ve
been pretty good on defense the
last few years]? said Terrapin
Coach Joe Krivak. “Most people

The defensive line will change
frequently, operating in a multiple

Hines and Mark Sturdivant often
line up as down linemen. Hines,
another fifth-year senior, has two
sacks, while Sturdivant has 20

Pomtbersfozce similar T 9130 oﬁense

By Derek Willis
Asst. Sports Editor

The Pitt defense might have to

look twice when it lines up against .

the offense of Maryland this
Saturday. After all, the Maryland
offense is very similar to the one
Pitt runs.

“This style of offense is a high-
percentage, low-interception, get-
the-ball—to—the-runners-and—1et-
them-do-something-out—in-the-
open,” said "Pitt head coach Paul
Hackett, referring to the Terrapins.

Let’s see: Maryland completes
60 percent of its passes, has two
interceptions in four games and
two tight ends lead the team in
receptions. Sound familiar?

That fact should be a little

comforting to Hackett, after facing

an unknown Minnesota offense

. last week. People are still trying

to figure out the Gophers.

To prepare, Hackett will do the
logical thing: Have the first—team
offense and defense face each
other more in practice. “This week
we will practice againsteach other
a lot,” Hackett said, “because we
have a very similar philosophy
and style.”

There are several differences

‘in the Terp offense, though. The

featured weapon is H-back Frank
Wycheck, who lines up nearly
everywhere: tailback, fullback,
wingback and even tight end.

The 225—pound sophomore led ’

the Atlantic Coast Conference in
receiving last year . In three games
Wycheck has 16 catches for 143
yards. “He gives us that versatility, ”
said Maryland Coach Joe Krivak.
“I’d like to have a couple of guys
like him.”

Wycheck isn’t much of a threat
to run, even though he is
occasionally in the backfield. He
hasn’t even carried the ballthis
year. Same goes for Wycheck’s
backup, Chad Wiestling. Despite
not starting any games this year,
he ranks second in receptions
with 11, indicating how important
the H—back position is.

The runners in the Maryland
offense are Mark Mason and Troy

Jackson. Mason, a sophomore
with dazzling speed, leads the
team with 260 yards on the
ground and two touchdowns.
“He does some things you don’t
coach,” Krivak said. “He has the
potential of making the big play
for us."

Mason alternates with the
senior Jackson. Depth isn’t a big
concern in a largely one-back
offense, but if either Mason or
Jackson goes down, it will be.

The key, according to both
coaches, is ‘senior quarterback
Jim Sandwisch. Sandwisch, a
former walk-on, led the Terps to
a season-opening victory against
Virginia but was injuredfor most
of the next two games.

Sandwisch has 283 yards
passing, completing 58 percent
of his attempts for no touchdowns
and two interceptions. The Terp
passing game has only registered
one passing score this year, while
throwing six interceptions.

The receiving corps itself does
not play a large, role. The leading

-wideout is Richie Harris, who

Name

STUDENT HOMECOMING EDITION

has four catches and the lone
touchdown. Harris is all of 5 foot,
10 inches and 144 pounds. Split
end Gene Thomas has 18 yards
in receptions in 1991.

The offensive line sports
another dominating senior center
in Mitch Suplee, a 270-pounder.
Three juniors and a first—year
player round out the line, which
isn’t particularly big and has
allowed 10 sacks.

The tight ends are used mainly
to block; starterJoe Cooper hasn’t
caught a pass yet.

Overall this is an -' offense
struggling to find a leader at
quarterback. If Sandwisch is
healthy, then he'll be the man.
But the offense has yet to assert
itself.The team has managed a
meager 255 yards of total offense
a‘ game. A defensive key for Pitt
will be the play of the linebackers,
who must adjust to a different
offense. “This is a much different
game for the linebackers,’”’
Hackett. said “They’re going to
have to come up and make tackles
and contain the runners.” ‘

Smith Will give’ Pitt   H  
tickets to deserving 
Pittsburgh children J

Former Pitt basketball star Charles Smith is giving back to the Q
Pittsburgh community. ' T ’

Smith, now entering his fourth season with the National.
Basketball Association’s Los Angeles Clippers, has entered into S
a promotional agreement with Kelloggs. The agreement deals, "
with playing cards featuring the collegiate careers of current
NBA stars. Smith has specified that part of the proceeds be used
to provide tickets for Pitt football and basketball games to
deserving children who might not be able to otherwise see a
Panther game. i_.

“Kids should not be denied the chance to see Pitt football or
basketball just because they can’t afford it, ” Smith said. “Hopefully,
some of these kids will now have the chance to enjoy these J
sports, even if it's only one time.”

Under the program, tickets are being distributed for Pitt’s next
two home football games: Maryland this Saturday and Syracuse ,
on Oct. 19. The Pitt athletic department supervises the distribution
of tickets. _

“This is a generous and valu able contribution by Charles, one‘
that certainly will produce tangible benefits both to the Pittsburgh
community and to the Pitt athletic department,” said athletic’ T

By Brian Berger

Showcase Editor

For the first time since the 1983
New York Islanders won it, the
Stanley Cup returned to the Patrick
with the joyous May victory of
the Pittsburgh Penguins. Mired in
mediocrity since the early ’80s,
the Patrick is now ready to make
the leap to the NHL’s top division,
_hoisted atop the Pens’ shoulders.

There’s no reason to believe
the Pens will falter from the top
as long as Mario Lemieux is
healthy. If he goes down, the
Pittsburgh Penguins’ hopes at
a repeat will be crushed. Lemieux

“is again ready to attack Wayne

Gre_tzky’s scoring records, but
some problems remain for the
Penguins.

Scotty Bowman is the new
coach and will attempt to continue

 

the Badger’s way. Forget it. Let
Lemieux coach, and while he’s at
it, he can give up some of his
salary to sign Ron Francis. Mario
says he wants 215, as in Gretzky’s

- point record, but he’ll need a N o. .

2 center like Francis, who is
dangerous, to ease the defensive
load he’ll face each night. Francis’
signing is a must. The rest of the
offense is lethal with all-stars
Kevin Stevens and Mark Recchi,
as well as Jaromir Jagr , Joe
Mullen and a host of grinders.
The defense is led and let down
by the burnin’ Paul Coffey. His
power-play contributions and
ability to carry the puck are
unparalleled; so is his back-
checking at times, as he follows
opponents to the net. Larry
Murphy is a quality triggerman
and played the best defensive
hockey of his career under

Johnson’s system. Ulfsamuelsson
provided all the right muscle,
and Gordie Roberts was the
unsung hero of the defense. The
rest of the players are young, big
and/or qualified. Keys to the team
will be its hunger and how well
Johnson’s positive aura and
system rubbed off. Tom Barrasso
is great at home and has hopefully
put the past behind him after a
tremendous postseason.

The N ewJ ersey Devils scored
a serious find in the free-agent
market, as they were awarded
Scott Stevens as compensation
for Brendan Shanahan. Eric
Weinrich is coming off a brilliant
rookie season; Bruce Driver is
vastly underrated and Alexei
Kasatonov is world-class.
Viacheslav Fetisov hasn’t been
the player the Devils thought he
would be. TommyAlbelin played

' solid D after recall from Utica,

and Lee Norwood is a bruising

veteran. Deep, sound and mean

makes up the Devils’ defense.
With the addition of Stephan

Richer, the Devils continue their
fine tradition of scoring wingers.
John MacLean is one of the
league’s best snipers (45 goals,
although he’s out for a month),
and Claude Lemieux is a villain
with a touch (30 goals).

Chris Terreri is the pipe man
and a good one. With Stevens,
he’ll be pushing for an all-star
berth. Sean Burke’s career in New
Jersey seems to be over , but he
makes nice trade bait. If Lou
Lamoriello can land a play—making
center (see Winnipeg) for his
services, uh—oh. The Devils have
a history of locker—room turmoil,
and headcase Richer’s addition
and Steven's unwillingness to
-report do not help. As usual,
Coach Torn McVie’s job is in
jeopardy.

“No heart, no heart” are the last
gasps we’ve heard out of the
NewYork Rangers camp, as the
Rangers were eliminated by

Washington last spring. Is this the.

team that spent 87.5 percent of
that year in first place, or is this

 2‘ Penguinsto hold off Devils in strong Patrick Division

the team that the punchless
Capitals dropped like luggage in
April? Tough call, but the Rangers
of '91-’92 will have some new
faces for the Madison Square
Garden faithless to throw at.
Offensively the Rangers have
some firepower. Mike Gartner
touched net 49 times last year,
while Bernie Nicholls added 75
points. Consistent left wing John
Ogrodnick added 26 goals to the
campaign last year, but the
Rangers’ scariest feature is their
plethora of young talent. ‘
The Ranger defense is small,
and that hurts. Brian Leetch and
James Patrick form the best 1-2
punch in the East. But around the
net the Rangers suffered, as David
Shaw, Randy’ Moller and Mark
Hardy remained healthy but
almost scared to clear the crease.
Mike Richter is super as a net
protector. If’ Smith gets his man
on D and even a few youngsters
gel, the Patrick brass is up for
grabs. The Rangers are apparently
very close to striking a massive

4&5

deal for Mark Messier, which“??-

would immediately give “heart,
heart” to the Nueva Yorkers.

From the top three to the bottom
three there is a huge dropoff, but
thanks to some off—season
dealings, the Philadelphia
Flyers should sneak past the
Capitals. I

The F lyers, after being skipped
in the playoff dash the last two
years, got busy this spring.'First
Philly acquired the rights to Jarri
Kurri then shipped him to LA for
some much—needed defensive
help. Steve Duchesne arrives to
lead an interesting blend of
backliners. Duchesne racked up
62 points a season ago and gives
the Flyers the point man their
power play desperately needs.
Bruisers Kjell Samuelsson and
Terry Carkner add muscle, and
several youngsters show promise.

Rick T occhet remains the Flyers
top goal—scorer and is a proven
all-star. But alas, Tocchet should
receive some help thanks -to
newcomers Rob Brind’Amour,
Dan Quinn and Brad Jones.
Brind’Amour could find his niche
on T occhet’s line. Quinn is crafty

..-1

I?

but weak and could be hated by _

the Spectrum fans. Jones is a true
“Flier” — fast, with an accurate
shot. Mike Ricci is ready for prime
time, and Pelle Eklund and Murray
Craven (both 19 goals) should be
helped ‘with new linemates.
Believe it or not, the Flyers’ first
two lines aren’t bad. Steve Kaspar

also comes over from LA as a top"?-

defensive forward and great face-
off man.

Ron Hextall is the go—to goalie,
and if he stays healthy or out of
trouble, he can be awesome. He
can also be terrible. Ken Wregget
is major trade bait, and with Pete
Peeters gone, 21-year-old
Dominic Roussel could be the
Flye-12 backup. If Hextall is
healthy, that’s fine; if not, Wregget
will have to remain, and the Flyers
will be stuck with a goalie that is
worth something on the market
(see Winnipeg). ’

Defense and penalty-killing are
where it’s at in our nation’s capital,
where the Washington
Capitals reside. Don Beaupre’s

For The Pitt News
The Pitt soccer team used strong
team defense Wednesday night
to gain a 0-0 tie with Marshall
University in a match packed
with excellent goaltending. A
‘Pitt netrninder Tim Sobelman

 made 10 savesren route to his
fourth shutout of the season. h
The Panthers applied early"

pressure on the Marshall defense,
only to be denied by first—year
goalie Ryan Payne. Pitt captain
Nick Liberati attempted a shot off
an indirect free kick, but Payne
made the save, one of 13 on the
night.

Later in the half, Payne denied

- midﬁelder Ted Noethling with a

graceful punch save of a rocket
shot from the top of the box.
“IPaynel came up big all night,”
said Sobelman, who was
impressed with the Thundering
Herd keeper.
_A positive sign in the match
was the solid defense, in particular

"'.."_;’7?]|,;_".'_It‘A“: - -V -- an r‘ v- I 3- ~ , >

senior defender Scott McCurry.
He drew the tough role of
shadowing Marshall’s top
offensive threat, senior Kurt
Mueller. The “O” beside the
Marshall score is a tribute to the
job McCurry did on the potent
forward. ' ' , _ A I

“McCrury was all ‘over [Mueller].
He shut him down,” said a positive
Sobelman, who deﬂected the
credit for the shutout to his
teammates. “We still had a few
breakdowns but were much better
than Sunday.”

Sobelman matched Payne save
for save, including two big saves
on shots by Thundering Herd
midﬁelder Michael Glasgow, who
proved to be Marshall’s top threat.

The first came off a Marshall
corner kick. Glas glow one-timed
the crossing pass on goal, only to
be thwarted by the agile Pitt
tender, who lunged left to make
the save. Sobe1man’s second
“theft” was a diving save of bullet
shot from the left corner of the
goal box.

Basically, the Capitals’ forwards

Kelly Miller led the team in goals

Hamilton left no doubt about

meat of their schedule.

THE pm NEWS, Saturday, October 5, 1991

Devins rebounding from injuries to pace women ’s tennis

By Chris Franklin
For The Pitt News

The ball was hit long by Erika
Devins. She had just lost the
point to her opponent and would
eventually lose the match. But
there was something strange
about this scenario. She was

- smiling.

Yes. Smiling.
‘ “If I mess up, I just try to laugh
it off,” said the Pitt junior.

Devins must not smile or laugh
too much, considering she has an
8-1 record in singles play this
season. In fact, she has not even
lost a set in her victories. Her
strong showing has led Pitt to an
impressive 7-2 mark. Devins has
been very pleased with the season v
thus far. '

“I was very surprised [at the

team’s start]. I was excited,” said
Devins. “We have a lot more
depth this year, which has helped
us. Everyone on the team gets
along, and that makes it fun."
Devins hopes to avoid injuries,
which have plagued her collegiate
career. During her first year she
pulled a groin muscle and missed
a month. _ ’ _
That was nothing compared to
her injury last year. Devins
underwent a bone scan, which
revealed a stress fracture of her

. femur. This setback put her out

of action for about four months.
Because of her injuries, Devins
believes she has something to
prove .

“I haven’t improved since I've
been here because I’ve always
been hurt. Just to stay injury—free
is a goal for me,” Devins said.

Coach George Dieffenbach said
Devins’ injury last year really
slowed the team.

‘‘It really hurt the team. We
were below .500 in the fall, and
when she came back we almost
reached .500,” Dieffenbach said,
referring to last year’s 10-12
record. When Devins was healthy,
she posted a 9-3 mark.

Dieffenbach said Devins is an
invaluable member of the team.

“She’s a consistent tennis player
and a very hard worker. She's
one of the most coachable players
on the team,” he said. ‘

Dieffenbach added that a big
reason for her success this year,
in addition to her ground strokes,
is an improved mental game.
According to Dieffenbach, Devins
has “developed an ability to stay
relaxed under pressure." _

Devins agreed with her coach’s
assessment.

“I think I’m a lot more mentally

A tough now. It used to be a really
_'big weakness for me, but I’ve

learned to relax more,” she said.

Aside from using her talents in
singles action, Devins teams with
her partner in crime, Julie LoPrinzi,
to form Pitt’s most dominating
doubles pair, This season the two
have an 8-1 record, losing only to
an undefeated California (Pa.)
squad. Devins has been LoPrinzi’s
partner since their ﬁrst year.

“She’s my roommate and my
best friend. I can’t imagine playing
without her," Devins said. “We
know how to encourage each
other. We know when to say
something and when not to say
something.”

Coach Dieffenbach said he likes
the way they complement each
other on the court.

“Julie is more aggressive, while
Erika is more consistent. Erika is
becoming more aggressive
though,” he said. “They’ve played
a lot of matches together. I’m
hoping it pays off in the Big East
Championships.”

The championships are to be

Devins, who majors in both
business and psychology, is no
stranger to tournaments. While
attending Owen J. Roberts High
School in Pottstown, Pa., she
placed highly in many national
tournaments and one
international tournament.

She credits her father who was
a frequent tennis player with
introducing and teaching her the
game.

“I remember one time [my
family] went on vacation. My dad
was playing, and he showed me
what to do. I just picked things
up real easily,” Devins said. “He
became my coach.”

After graduating from high
school, Devins was recruited by
many schools, including Penn
State, Syracuse and George
Washington. Her father suggested
that she visit Pitt, which didn’t
exactly excite her.

“At first I thought, ‘There’s no
way I’m going to Pittsburgh.’ But
afterl visited there for a recruiting
weekend, I loved it. I loved how
[the university] was close to the
city, but there was a campus
there. I also loved the coach and
the players,” said Devins, who

'6»

chose Pitt over Louisville in her .

final choice.

Coach Dieffenbach has to be
pleased with Devins’ play this
season and her attitude.

“She always has a positive
attitude,” Dieffenbach said.

Even on those rare occasions
when she’s losing.

The first big Big Ten
showdown, and the way
Michigan State is going this one

Rob, hook up the beat, and I’ll

lay the plan—o.

Iowa comes in with a balanced
offensive attack led by Senior QB
Matt Rodgers, who could thrust
himself into the Heisman spotlight
with a win and big game here.
Rodgers is tossing at a 57-percent
clip with 6 TDs and 1 interception.

His boy is wingback Danan
Hughes, who is averaging 24
yards a catch. The backs are
deep and average 225 yards a
contest, while the line is
mammoth, averaging 280. A
classic showdown of midweste rn
beef vs. beef.

The defense has allowed an

average of 243 yards per game.
Granted, they thrashed Hawaii,
Northern Illinois and Iowa State.
They're strangling against the pass,
and defensive end Leroy Smith
leads a formidable pass rush with
4 sacks.

They’ve impressed so far, but
they’ve played dogs.

We saw the Wolverines fail in
their assault on the No.1 Seminoles,
but don’t fret. ,

The boys in blue will come
