SCORE

small businesses

By Joel A. Bloom
The Pitt News‘

In the dog-eat-dog world of small
business, where the rate offailure far
exceeds that of success, a helping
hand is always welcome.

That is-the reason for SCORE, the
Supervisory Corps of Retired Exec-
utives, which is a 20-year-old group
designed to provide assistance and
counseling to those interested in
starting their own small business.

As the name indicates, SCORE is
operated by retired business execu-
tives. One such former businessman
is Robert Cameron ofthe Pittsburgh
SCORE chapter. Cameron’s busi-
ness experience includes .over 40
yearsin the steel industry and 10
years in the petroleum chemical
engineering field.

“There is no fee charged for our
services,” Cameron said. “We volun-
teer our time to those who ask. Our
purpose is not to lend people any

_ money. We will, however, guarantee

up to 90 percent ofa bank loan. The
main reason for this being the
majority of those starting out in bus-
iness lack the capital needed to

helps

start.”
SCORE is hardly confined to the
Pittsburgh’ area. The organization
has chapters nationwide with a
membership total nearing 12,000.
“The Pittsburgh chapter has 45
members and serves most of western
Pennsylvania,” Cameron said. “We
go north up to Erie and as far east as
Harrisburg. We also have satellite
chapters in Erie, Charleroi, Greens-
burg an'd Indiana. I would say we get
about 1,400 requests annually.
“There has always been a trend
toward opening your own business,"

he continued. .“With mounting-

unemployment, more and more peo-
ple are becoming inclined toward

opening their own business, if only

for the fact of being self-employed.

This trend has become more preval-~
ent, especially within the last four or
five years or so.

“It’s hard for us to tell right now
whatrour success-failure ratio is,” he
said. “I would have to say that about
80 to 90 percent of those who come,
to us initially at least get their busi-
nessstarted.”

The Pitt News tried to interview
businessmen aided by the organiza-
.tion, however, Cameron said. It is
the policy of SCORE not to release
the names of clients.

New aid for jobless

By Patti Vishensky
The Pitt News

As government statistics released
in last week’s Post- Gazette show, the
national recovery from the recession
has not hoisted Pittsburgh out of its
unemployment rut.

Connie Rapp, co-chairman of the

Counseling Center’s Support Group '

for the Unemployed, saw the need
for a support group for the unem-
ployed here at Pitt. Along with
partner Linda Weis, Rapp is form-
ing a group for the benefit of those
who have been hunting for ajob but
can’t seem to find one.

The acceptance of nominations
for the second annual Chancellor's
Distinguished Teaching Awards
Program was announced Friday.

The program, conceived by
Robert L. Wolke, dean of the
Faculty Teaching Development
Program, awards $1000 to as many
as eight distinguished professors, .05
percent of eligible faculty, and
$10,000 to each professor’s school.

support group is “job searching.”

This award is similar in purpose,
according to Wolke, to those given
by individual schools, such as the
School of Medicine’s “Golden
Apple Award” and the CGS “Apple
for the Teacher Award.” It's
intended to be a tool for raising
faculty morale, he said, and support
for quality teaching rather than an
incentive for those who would seek
such an award for prestige’ and
profit. But it is in no way a substitute
for programs designed to improve
teaching methods, Wolke added.

Business study abroad

By Ann Cifra
For the Pitt News

A Pittsburgh organization ena-
bles area business students not only
to study abroad but to receive prac-
tical experience by holding intern
ships in foreign countries. '

The local chapter of AISEC, a
French acronym for the Interna-
tional Association of Students in
Economics and Business, was
founded by CMU students in 1976.
The primary functions of the group
are‘ to promote business manage-
ment skills and international cultu-
ral awareness.

The organization puts most of its
emphasis ‘on its International
ExchangeProgram. This program is
a reciprocal student exchange,
which means that the local commit-

tee must get support from local com-
panies in order to be able to send
Pittsburgh business students
abroad.

The internships abroad typically
last from two to four months and
include work in various business
fields. Two AISEC students from
Pittsburgh traveled to Japan
recently to work in marketing,
market research and banking. One
CMU student worked last summer
in Bristol, England, as a manage-
ment trainee and was involved in
production, computing and
accounting.

The Carnegie-Mellon branch has
also hosted business students from
abroad. Vincent Ricquart, a French
business student in Marseilles, came
to Pittsburgh in late July to begin a
two—month internship at Equibank.
About to enter his third year as a

business graduate student, he has
interned during each of his years in
business school. Last year, he
worked near his home in the south of

France doing a market study for a '

shipyard.

Ricquart has worked in financial
management while at Equibank. In
addition to the practical experience

he gained through participation in .

AISEC, he noted that there have
been other benefits. He said of his
internship at home, which was also
set up by AISEC, that “most of all, it
opens you up to business people in
your own town."

Ricquart said another advantage
to the program was that he didn’t
find himself alone when he arrived.
He met other AISEC students here.
Even his roommate was a foreign
AISEC student. Also, any problems

WASHINGTON (UPI) — Walter
Mondale said this weekend that he is
not planning to “upstage anybody”
by meeting with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko. The
Democratic presidential candidate
added that he does not believe that

the Russians are trying to play both —,

sides against each other.

“I can’t be used._ I’ve been
around,” he said.

Last Monday, Reagan announced
that he would meet Gromyko in
Washington on Sept. 28. It would be
the first meeting of his presidency
with a top Soviet official. Mondale
said he would meet with Gromyko
one day earlier in New York. _

White House spokesmen said that
the administration had no “advance
knowledge” of the Mondale-
Gromyko meeting and they declined
comment. Mondale said he did not
consult the White House or S'tate
Department because, in his words,
“I know what I’m doing.”

Mondale said the main arm’ of the
meeting would be to underscore the
importance of renewing negotia-
tions on the controlling of nuclear

 “The Pitt News, meaty“, September 17,1984

weapons.

WASHINGTON (UPI) — Presi-
dent Reagan relaxed this weekend,
while Walter Mondale was busy
with news conferences and meetings.
One reason for that might be some
recent voter surveys.

A Newsweek poll shows Reagan
leading Mondale by a whopping 18
percent. Fifty-seven percent of those
surveyed indicated that they favor
the Reagan-Bush ticket, white 39
percent backed Mondale-Ferraro.

An NBC poll puts the figures a
little differently, giving Reagan a 62
percent favorable vote to Mondale’s
32 percent. ‘

But by far the biggest landslide is
forecast by Horace Busby. The
former Johnson White House aide
predicted that Reagan will receive
493 votes in the Electoral College
compared to a_ paltry 11 for
Mondale.

Still, former Democratic presi-
dential hopeful Gary Hart warned
against succumbing to what he calls
“the ‘politics of despair.” “Polls do
not account for the fact that we have

passion on our side,” said the Colo-
rado senator.

On a slightly different tack, most
Americans surveyed by the Lou
Harris Organization feel that there’s

 

a need for a strict separation of V

church and state, and they said that
Walter Mondale would do a better
job of keeping them separate.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (UPI)

—— State lawmakers return to,

Harrisburg this week, and
among the decisions they’ll face
will be one on the construction
of hundreds of miles of new toll
roads.

House Democratic leaders
expect a resolution of differences
between the two chambers over a
bill ‘authorizing construction
and repair of nearly $4 billion
worth of toll roads. .

Lawmakers are scheduled to
spend three weeks in the capital
before taking a break to cam-
paign for the Nov. 6 election.

This was the deal: Jackson’s concert promoters want
sole access to the profits to be made by anything remotely
or directly generated by the concert. The promoters
offered the vendors at Three Rivers $1,000 each not to
show up for the concert and allow their own vendors to
sell Jackson memorabilia. The 27 souvenir vendors voted
and refused the buyout.

One should not think the unions didn’t have their own i

reputations and pocketbooks to think of in their decision.
The unions refused the highest buyout offered to city
vendors (six percent of the Jacksons’ vendors’ gross), a
move they wouldn’t have supported without strong
support from the Teamsters Eastern Conference.

The Teamsters union to which the vendors belong,
local 250, brought out some heavy hitters from Maryland

to give just that added support the local needed. The final '

vote to refuse the Jacksons’ offer overturned the

unsupported vote of l3-ll to accept the buyout on

Tuesday. .

Pittsburgh is not the first city to balk at the buyout
offer. The Jackson operators have had to up the ante in
other cities including deals to split concert profits with
vendors. But the Pittsburgh vendors refused to allow the
concert promoters to dictate their work ‘policy, and they
should be commended for it. Even if the vendors’ union
had its own proﬁts in mind, the vendors themselves acted
justly. .

Since the concert tour began, the concert promoters
have taken shameless advantage of the media hypeand
fanaticism over Michael Jackson. The promoters used

operators are trying to get their piece of Michael's pic, but
the gusto and bravado with which they manipulate tour
cites is unprecedented. The millions of records bought by
fans of the Jacksons have made them all quite rich, and
now,they are going back for that-last dollar under the
mattress, of the last loyal fourteen-year-old. _

The people of this city stood to collect close to $250,000
in taxes from the concert. The fans of Michael Jackson,
too, would have profited from the show. It is not the fault
of the vendors that the Jackson tour probably will not
come to Pittsburgh, but the fault of the greedy,
profiteering concert promoters and their inﬂexibility in

just how many millions of dollars they’ll take home_this '
year. _ .

Letters to the Editor

I agree with J. Picone on one of
his points: there is perhaps nothing
more sickening or more tragic than
the image of a 21-year-old run down
in the street in front of his school.

There is also, however, nothing so
irresponsible as the image of a 21-
year-old darting out into the heavy
traffic of Fifth Avenue. Looking
before crossing, crossing with the
light at designated corners and not
crossing bet/ween parked cars are the
stuff which first graders, if not kin-
dergartners, are weaned on.

That raceway, as Mr. Picone ref-
ers to Fifth Avenue, is a major tho-.
roughfare. With consecutive green
lights come consecutive red lights,

' most of which are equipped with

clues for the pedestrian, such as
“Walk” and “Don't Walk.” In order
to'be the best protected campus in
town, would Mr. Picone have the
chancellor hold each and every col-
lege student's hand across this
street? Establish kindly crossing
guard matrons on all corners? Aren’t
we a little old for this kind of
treatment? _

_ Furthermore, if Mr. Picone is

Indeed going the speed limit of 25

Rod Lincoln, but also that'of the
average bicycle. More to the point,
though, in confronting Mr. Picone’s

important 21-year-old off his

Dogs relieve themselves in the
street or on parked cars; people do
not; or do they? It is a sad social
commentary when Pitt students are
seen, alone or traveling in bands,
answering the call of nature in°var-
ious parking lots on campus during
the night. -

When confronted regarding this
animal-like behavior, the obnoxious
aberrations’ defense is to puff up
their biceps, prepared to defend
their ri "hts like a provoked blow-

the word “MEN” on most doors
there lies a full array of personal
hygiene equipment. Could it be that
simple? Maybe the truth lies within
the background of the grunting
blowfish. The fact may be that this

' lowly species grew up in a‘ world

totally devoid of procelain and the
resulting stench of their immediate
surroundings caused them to puff
up. Likewise, the grunting may be
the result of inﬂamed nasal passages
caused by the odors of urea.
Whether the present situation is
caused by an insecure past coupled
with an unsure future or just a
healthy rebellious attitude toward

good hygiene, the fact remains that ‘

most Pitt students do not need the
aggravation of hosing down their
cars each day. So to all you grunting
blowfish out there,. this Bud’s for
you; let's just hope you can hold it in.

Since watching the two

The Democratic Party .under
Walter Mondale has turned away
from its past of progressive thinking
and positive leadership to one of a
party of apologists. The domestic
policies he proposes are old New

ineffective. In foreign policy, he

‘apologizes and blames the U.S. for

problems everywhere. This is not
what thepublic wants to hear. This
is not what the public needs.

progressive, positive leaders. But
Carter and Mondale were and are
both political wimps. The US. does
not have to be a world bully. But our
allies and position-in the world
demand that we hold a positive,
effective position of leadership.

Mondale sounds like a return to.
Jimmy Carter, who was a disaster.
The, public in this country is
enjoying the new found position of
leadership in the world. ‘Walter
Mondale’s rhetoric does not sound

like he wants to keep it.-

His domestic rhetoric is not
appealing, either. By calling for a tax
increase, he scarésgoff many voters.
The country is in ‘the middle. of an
economic turnaround that keeps
bafﬂing the experts. As the experts
keep calling for a slowdown and tax

increases, the recovery keeps rolling
along much to their chagrin. Voters
see this and wonder about
Mondale’s wisdom of tax increases.

‘5. . . Carter and Mondale
were and are both
political -Wimps . . .

)1

Walter Mondale is the wrong man
for the Democrats.

But what about Ronald Reagan?
He, on the other hand, is a very
positive thinker (rose-colored

glasses, maybe). The country is’

turns out apologists

better off now than it was four years
ago and that is hard for any
candidate to beat. In foreign policy,
the U.S. has taken a tougher stand
than in the past. We are perceived as
a stronger nation. But at what risk
and cost?

All of this was, however, a

‘position obtained at high risk and

cost —- record deficits, dead Marines
and larger nuclear arsenals. Now I
know what some are thinking, but it
was not the U.S. who walked out of
the START Talks. It is the Soviets
who are now being obstinate. They
played Reagan’s hand but he had the
cards to beat them. The real bottom
line question, though, is: Are we
more secure?

Finally, Reagan’s biggest asset is
‘his ability to convince people he is
right. He has done that with great

style recently, and ‘that is his best
device for
problem. If he can convince enough
people that his solution is correct
and might work, it just might work.

For American "consumers,
confidence is the word and the
confidence is running high. It is his
positive approach that is so
appealing to voters and it is this, in
the end, that will win him re-
election.

As for me, I’m not convinced by
either. But since I also believe in my
right and responsibility to vote, for
the second election in a row, I will
not vote for a major candidate. In
1980, it was John Anderson. . In
I984, it will be a write-in vote for
Gary -Hart. He is the candidate that
upholds the Democratic traditions
of progressive, positive thinking.

Primanti’s  

is
coming

By llona Segedy
The Pitt’ News

Primanti’s, the Strip District’s
legendary restaurant that prides
itself on serving the best sandwich in
Pittsburgh, is opening a branch in
Oakland. The new restaurant
expected to open before or shortly
after the Pitt-WVU clash on Sept.
29, will stand on the site that for-
merly housed “Deli On Tap” and
“Fatso’s.” ‘

Pete Landis, owner of the new
Primanti’s, said that he and his two
partners, Jim Patrinos and Nick
Nicholas, have wanted to branch out
for several years. The three ulti-
mately chose Oakland because, as
Landis said, “It was the most logical
place.” Banking on Oakland's char-
acter‘, Landis expects to establish a
broad and strong clientele ranging
from hospital workers ‘to. Pitt
students. , b

The new Primanti’s is to bea re-
creation of the one in‘ the Strip Dis-
trict. Since the early l930’s, the
restuarant served night-shift
workers in the Pittsburgh freight
yards, which accounts for the restau-
rant’s late hours — not opening until
midnight. The Oakland restaurant‘s
hours will not compare with its Strip
District counterpart, but it will
match its atmosphere, menu and
prices. -

The Oakland Primanti’s.will open
at 7 a.m. Monday through Saturday
and will close at 2 a.m. on week-
nights and 4 a.m. Friday and Satur-
day. These hours will probably
appeal to a wide variety of people.
Landis is hopeful that he‘ will draw
crowds of students from Pitt, CM U,
Carlow.and Chatham, particularly

‘after the Oakland bars close on tra-

ditional drinking nights. He
expressed the desire that “people
have the best time they can when
they come here." ,

The atmosphere of Primanti’s wil —

definitely be unique to Oakland.
One might sit and socialize over a
beer and sandwich, or pick up food
or a six-pack to take out. There will
be a total of 80 seats available in the
balcony and bar area —— ample room
to enjoy a rowdy atmosphere com-
plete with loud music, a dark wood
decor and picture of the Strip
District.

The Strip‘ District Primanti’s
prides itself on its cleanliness, rea-
sonable prices and fresh food — as
its Oakland branch will. Everything
served in the restaurant is .made
fresh daily and every sandwich
comes hot off the grill and complete
with the famous tomato, potato and
coleslaw combination. Although
best known for its Cheese Steak, Pri-
manti’s menu includes a variety of
sandwiches priced between $2 and
$2.50. Six competitively priced beers

. will be on tap with pitchers available

and a variety of six packs will be
ready for take-out. Soft drinks will
also be served.

Landis is confident that he will

V establish a successful business here

in Oakland. On his inevitable com-

.petition with the “O,” Landis said, “I ~

don't feel that we’re in competition
with anyone. If wesold hot dogs,
we'd be in competition with the ‘O’."

Granted, both the *0" and Pri-
manti's are famous for their special-
ties — the “O" for its hot dogs and
fries, and Primanti’s for its unique
sandwiches. And there's always
room for specialty foods in Oak-
land. But it'll be interesting to see,

— once Primanti’s'opens, which spe-

cialty is favored. a

Recent study forecasts teacher crisis 

WASHINGTON (USPS) — The
nation is facing a teacher shortage so
severe that the least academically
qualiﬁed could become “the tenured
teaching force for the next two
generations of American

schoolchildren," according to a
recent study-~by the Rand
Corporation.

“The nation‘s teaching force is

, changing dramatically,” the study

says, as the number of well-
educated, experienced teachers
diminishes rapidly. Older teachers
are retiring, and younger teachers
are leaving the ﬁeld for other
occupations. But, the Rand study

and other surveys suggest, neither I

the quantity nor the quality of new
teachers is sufficient to replace those
who are leaving.

What the Rand survey calls “a
crisis in teaching” may be brought
on by changing American
demographics, the failure of the
education system to' attract and
retain the more qualified teachers,
and the failure of American
education schools to maintain
adequate standards.

Demographic trends have become
a problem because after more than a
decade of declining enrollments in
elementary and secondary schools,
the children of the post-World War
II “baby boom” generation will
cause a surge in elementary school
enrollment beginning around 1985.
At the same time, however, the
college-age population from which.
most potential teachers are drawn
will continue to decline throughout
the ’80s and into the 905.

Furthermore, academically-
inclined women and minorities,

once restricted to teaching as a‘

professional option,‘ are ‘now
moving into ﬁelds which offer better
pay, better working conditions and
better chances for advancement.

‘Fewer and fewer choose, let alone

feel obliged, to take up teaching.
By 1988, Rand says, the supply of

new teachers “may satisfy ' only‘

about 80 percent of the demand.”
But incentives to join the teaching

‘profession are dropping even faster

than the supply of new teachers.
Teachers’ salaries, low to begin
with, have declined 15 percent over

.the past decade. Salaries in general

have risen 15 percent. -
More damaging, however, is a
trend toward rigid bureaucracy in
education that cuts deeply into job
satisfaction and the non-monetary
rewards of teaching. And, according

' to the Rand study, those teachers

most discouraged by _ rampant
bureaucratic interference, lack of
autonomy and heavy paperwork are
the ones who are most qualiﬁed and
most extensively prepared to teach.

Nevertheless, the most disturbing
failure is on the part of the nation‘s
education schools, not the education
system.

One-third to one-half of the

I nation’s education schools are

nothing but diploma mills and
should be shut down, said Emily
Feistritzer of the National Center
for Education Information at a
Washington press conference two
weeks ago.

, Small institutions that have
proliferated in the past 10 years tend
to have low or nonexistant stand-

ards for entering offinishing teacher
training programs, she said. A-
While the number of teacher
education graduates has dropped by
more than half between l973 and
1983, the number of undergraduate
teacher education programs has
actually increased by 1 l5, Feistritzer
claims. This is possibly because
education programs can earn a
school considerable amounts of
money with only a fraction of the
capital investment that other
programs such as engineering
require. But to keep going at a time
when qualified applicants are scarce,

  The Pitt News, Monday,’ September 17‘, 198}:

these schools have had to keep
standards low and output high.

Feistritzer’s research shows that
more than 90 percent of all
education schools do not consider
high school grade point averages a
criterion for admission. And 82
percent do not set SAT cutoffscores
as a minimum requirement-

Only 47 percent of the schools
require any test for the completion
of their programs, and -only five
percent demand that prospective
teachers pass a test on the subject
they plan to teach.

Feistritzer’s previous work has

been published by the Carnegie
Endowment for the Advancement of
Teaching, and a recent ABC News
special report echoes her findings.

ABC reports that in California,
one-third of‘ all the graduating
teacher candidates failed a test of
basic skills in reading, writing and
math skills. In Houston, Texas, .
more than 40 percent of new
teachers failed a basic skills test.
And in Montgomery County,
Maryland, one of the nation's most
afﬂuent areas, 45 percent of English '
teacher applicants failed an English
test.

“Schools
prepare teachers for our classrooms
are in danger of becoming academic
wastelands," said ABC’s Marshall
Frady. \\

Over the past 18 months, the
Rand study asserts, there have been
major reports calling for higher
educational standards, increased
course requirements, and other
major reforms designed to increase
the quality of instruction. “But,” the
study goes on, “the crisis now
emerging in the teaching profession
could preclude the attainment of the
other reforms being urged.”

Reagan plan to lower teens summer wages

WASHINGTON (USPS) —— A
Reagan Administration proposal to
provide summer jobs for unem-
ployed teenagers by establishing an
experimental sub-minimum wage is
currently before Congress.

Dubbed the “Youth Employment
Opportunity Wage Act,” the bill
would permit businesses to hire
workers 19 and under for $2.50 an
hour, subject to some tight restric-
tions. Employers would, for
instance, be forbidden to ﬁre,
transfer or demote any workers
hired before the act takeseffect in
order to replace them with cheaper
teenage labor. Not even the wages of
previously hired teens who might
otherwise qualify for the “opportun-
ity wage” could be cut. Only tempor-
ary, summertime workers would be
eligible for wage. '

The act would establish the
opportunity wage as a pilot program
running from May through Sep-
tember of 1987. After that, Congress
would receive an evaluation of the
program’s results before taking
more permanent action.

Labor Department projections
indicate that the special wage rate
would open at least 400,000 and pos-
sibly as many as 640,000 new _iobs

tor the most chronically unem-
ployed sector of the economy.
Umemployment among all youth
is currently hovering between I9 and
20 percent, more than twice the
national rate of joblessness. But
average figures understate the sever-
ity of teenage unemployment in

‘America. Unemployment of rela- ‘

tively affluent white teenagers is
only I7 percent or so, but unemploy-
ment of black teenagers is a catastro-
phic 43 percent.

‘ Such inability to find jobs can
have long-term effects far more dev-
astating than a short-term lack of
constructive things to do. Studies by
the National Bureau of Economic
Research have shown that work
experience is a key determinant of
wages in the first four years out of
school. Data suggest that each year
of work experience may be asso-
ciated with a 10 to 20 percent per-
manent increase in wages. Other

studies indicate that the discipline of
even part-time employment eaiily in
life ‘makes workers better able to
hold a job later on.

  

Opponents of the ill, most nota-
bly the AFL-CIO, insist that the

plan would take jobs away from _
"union workers and give them to

younger ones. Organized labor lead-
ers seem to think that the opportun-
ity wage act sets a dangerous
precedent, even if it does have strict,
built-in limitations backed by sub-

‘ stantial criminal and civil penalties.

Supporters of the bill before Con-
gress are quick to point out .that the

youth opportunity wage act would
provide valuable employment expe-
rience to nearly half a million tee-
nagers at virtually no" cost. Current
federal youth employment pro-
grams, which would not be cut by
the bill, provide 718,000 summer
jobs for youth at a cost of $725
million.

Nevertheless, with unusually
broad-based support from such
diverse groups as the National Con-
ference of Black Mayors, the Feder-

ation of Independent Business, the
National Association of Minority
Contractors and the National Res-
taurant Association, backers of the
bill are confident that it will pass
before the end of the month.

The Youth Employment Oppor
tunity Act could be leading the way
for a number of other programs
lesigned to reduce unemployment.
The Urban League, for instance, has
recently proposed that inner-city
teens be exempted not only from the
minimum wage but also from Social
Security taxes. The National Associ-
ation of Minority Contractors h‘s

suggested that the Youth Employ-
ment Opportunity Wage Act be
combined with a Targeted Jobs Tax
Credit program to provide further
incentives for hiring disadvantaged
youth. Several ﬂat tax proposals
would drop anyone making less than
$14,000 a year offthe tax rolls com-
pletely. And after being locked up in
committee for two years, Rep. Jack
Kemp’s enterprise zone bill is gath-
ering new support.

The fate of the opportunity wage
act could foreshadow important
developments in American politics.
Successful passage of the bill could
mark the emergence of a new con-
sensus on reducing unemployment
led by the once-polarized factions of
minority leaders and self-styled
“populists" like Jack Kemp. And
successful implementation ofthe bill
might bring on a rush of similar
plans to spur economic growth in
targeted areas by preferential tax
policies and by selective-reduction of
government regulation. A rush_ of
plans just in time for the 1988
elections.

Graduate
ouﬂook

(USPS) — An expanding econ-
omy made the job outlook for this
year's graduating class brighter than
it was in 1983, according to the Col-
lege Placement Council's annual
Salary Survey Report.

The number of job offers to recip-
ients of bachelor’s and master’s
degrees was higher this year for
nearly all disciplines, with almost
10,000 more job offers going to
graduating seniors than in July,
1983. Starting salaries, however,
were largely unchanged, although
certain ﬁelds did record salary
increases of two to- five percent.

Engineering graduates, as in the

past, received the highest starting
salary offers. Petroleum engineers
received the best offers, averaging
$29,420 and $26,556 respectively.

Other disciplines, such" as the
humanities, social sciences, compu-
ter science and business fields all
recorded wage inceases. Graduate
programs, including MBAs, also
recorded substantial increases in job
offers and salaries.

The Salary Survey based its data
on offers, not acceptance, made to
college graduates in various fields
between September 1983 and June
1984. Submitted data originates
from .187 placement offices at 162
participating colleges and_
universities.

said.

Gillespie is in a unique positon to
contribute to the team; she is
Collier’s first substitute for both
Young and Wexell.

“Sally has been our jack-of-all-
trades sub,” Collier said. “She likes a
challenge, to be put in the position
where the team has its back against
the wall and she has to come in and
make a difference.”

Gillespie’s attitude is one of
adjustment to anything that might
happen to her team. “We have to
adapt,” she said. “Each player has to
contribute. We’ll do what we have to
do."

Wexell is the center of Pitt's
unusual serve reception tactics. As
the team’s back court specialist, it is

her responsibility to receive as many
serves as possible. Collier maintains
that his is the only team in the
country to utilize that method of
attack. . ' A -

“She is our No. l back court
player, and' without her doing that
puts pressure on the rest of the
team,” Collier said.

Gillespie and Rupp agreed that
Wexell’s absence will be noticed.
Rupp called Wexell “the greatest
passer on the team" but added that
Wexell’s’ absence “makes us get
better faster. She’s got a lot of things
that she adds to the team.”

Rupp also noted that Wexell is an
effective spiker, but she added that
Gillespie would be “hitting high-
hand from the outside.”

Gillespie, who will be helping

Rupp set tomorrow night, placed
responsibility for taking up slack on
the rest of the team. “Kris is a key
with our passing, ” she said. “The
rest of us will have to be more
consistent.”

» The injuries and illnesses to these
players result in increased playing
time for other athletes. Pat Belcher
is a senior whose knee and shoulder
problems have “reduced her

effectiveness," according to Collier. ‘

“We’ll be relying on her more. She
no longer has the luxury of being a
part-time player but will be a major
factor in every game,” Collierstated.

Freshman Louise O’Shaughnessy
is another beneﬁciary of the team’s
health problems — she will be
starting in the team’s first regular
season match. Collier said he is

confident in O’Shaughnessy’s ability
to go into the game and play
effectively.

Despite the continued setbacks,
the team’s goals have not been
altered.

“Our goals have not changed at
all,” Collier said. “We are still very
committed ,t9\attaining certain
goals. We’re still prepared to knock
off a couple of Top 10 teams.“

Duquesne and IUP are not high

pertinence nonetheless. “It‘s

“They knocked the hell out of the
offensive line,” Fazio added. “They
blasted the tight ends, they blasted
the backs, they blasted the line, they
blasted the quarterback. Everyone
got manhandled. They were . so
damn quick getting in there, we
didn't have a chance to blow them
off the ball."

All the while, OU’s top defender,
end Kevin Murphy, had to leave the
game after getting injured on the
second play of the game.

The Panthers gained 96 yards in
the first half to OU’s 140, with 60 of

those coming from Congemi’s six "

completions on 16 tries. The running

A game in the first half‘? Get out a

metal detector to unearth it. The
Panthers netted 32 yards for the
entire game. Before Congemi left, he
completed 1 I out of 27 for 149 yards.

Wallace's nine receptions were
good enough for 135 of Pitt’s 217
passing yards.

Under Congemi for three quar-
ters, the offense took on direction-

- less tendencies. For most of the first

quarter, freshman Charles
Gladmanhstarting at tailback, got
the call, but often Pitt drives fizzled
with Congemi incompletions. By the
time the second quarter rolled
around the Panthers mixed it up so
much, one wondered who was
confusing whom.

The kicking game, a shining star
two weeks ago, crashed to earth
against OU. Punter Chris Jelic was
called upon six times in the first half,
finishing the day with a lackluster
29.1-yard average after eight kicks.
Once in the first quarter he fumbled
the snap and got off a 10-yard punt.
At the start of the second quarter an
OU punt hit special teams‘ man
John Lewis in the back, OU reco-
vered and drove for its first TD, a
Bradley sneak. Eight minutes later,
Sooner end Mike Aljoe pressured
Jelic, who scrambled for three yards
before being hit at OU’s 48. Bradley,
seven plays later, dove over from the
l-yard line again.

“It's way too easy to lay the
blame,” All-America tackle. Bill
Fralic said without pointing fingers
at anyone in a cemetery-like locker
room. “We all played had. We

_ could’ve played. better, but so could

the defense, so could the offense.”

Next week Pitt’s first road game is
against Temple, the same Owls who
faced Penn State last season in a
similar 0-3 situation. “I really think
we can come back," Fazio said. “We
have to learn how to play football,
learn how to catch, learn how to
tackle. We have to learn how to play
60 minutes of football.”

Facing Norman conquerors in
lO66, Anglo-Saxons couldn’t have
felt any less dispirited.

Another illness, another setback.
This type of thing happens early in
the season, and it has been
happening to the Pitt women’s
volleyball team with nightmarish

- frequency. Teams overcome early

season setbacks, if they are good
enough to. Only this time, the
ailment may be serious enough to
crush hopes of victory laurels on the
golden court of the Big East
tournament.

Three players will be unable to
participate in tomorrow night’s tri-
match at Duquesne, where Pitt will
take on the Duchesses at 6 p.m. and
Indiana University of Pennsylvania
immediately after. Two of them are
at least second-year starters.

“Judy Young was one of our top
spikers,” said coach Shelton Collier.

.“She was really a team leader,”_

setter Cathy Rupp stated.

Young was named to ﬁrst-team
All-Big East in leading Pitt to a
second-place finish in the conference
last season and should be in her
fourth season as a starter. The
spikers have once again set their
sights on the conference title and
upon upsetting several of the Top 10
teams they have taken on ——but that
before Young contracted
mononucleosis.

‘Add to that injuries to freshman '

Krista Zeiner and serve reception
specialist Kris Wexell, and one
might conclude that Collier and his

players have quite an uphill battle —

ahead of them. Not so, according to
Rupp.

“Emotionally, [the rash of
injuries] can be a letdownior it can
work the other way, as it seems to be
doing,” explained Rupp, a second-
year transfer from Ohio. “If practice
is any indication, the other people
will pick it up.”

Young and Rupp are usually the
setters in the team’s 6-2 offense,

hitters and two setters. Young, who

The Pitt women's tennis team
opened its season Friday afternoon
impressive win over
Carnegie-Mellon University on the
Lady Tartans’ home courts.

The Lady Panthers won seven of
the nine matches played —— five of
theasix singles matches and two of
the three doubles.

Senior Rhonda Gibbs played

V nearly flawless tennis, winning her

singles match 6-3, 6-1 over the Lady

A Tartans’ Laurie Arendas. Gibbs also

prevailed in her doubles play 6-0,

‘6-4.

“It felt good out there,” Gibbs
said. “I think the volley was the
strongest part of my game today. I
was, just more aggressive [than
Arendas]. Most girls won't rush the
net, but I did."

, Coach George Dieffenbach was
more than a little pleased with his
team’s performance. “They played
much better than I expected. Every-
body played well; nobody really had

-a bad day. We got up .for this

match.”

Dieffenbach gives much of the
‘credit to the Lady Panthers’ success-
ful start to attitude. “There is a lot of
motivation on this team. We are
going to work, work, work. There
was a lotof improvement out there
today." _

Jodi Levine, No. 1 in singles, won
in two sets 6-4, 6-4 over Darla Mes-
sick, but said after the match she

is knew she should have played better,

Not onlydid this match mark a

new season, but also heralded the '

-collegiate tennis debuts for four
freshman members. Carrie D_eVera,

some anxiety before the match.

“Sure I was nervous, very ner-
vous. But the butterﬂies went awav
once the match wore on,” said De-
Vera, who won 6-l, 6-2.

Another freshman, Stephanie
Nelson, was involved in the day’s
longest match before defeating Liza
Reed 6-! , 2-6, 6-4. One consequence
of her first collegiate match was, she
said, “tiring.”

Nelson also was bothered by a
case of pre-match nerves. “It was
scary to start to play,” she said, “but
once the game got going it all came
back to me.”

The most impressive performance
of the day, however, belonged to

Gibbs, who seemed to get better as

her matches wore on.

In trying to account for this sea-
son’s improved play over last, Gibbs
said, “I played in a lot of sanctioned
tournaments over the summer
where the competition is very tough.
I still have a long way to go before
I'm at the point where I_ want to be,
but with more work, I know I’ll get
there.” ‘ - j

A Sophomore Jenny Leach was
another doubles winner, knocking
off Leslie Inglese 6-1, 7-6 in her sin-
gles match before teaming with
Gibbs for a victory in doubles
competition. V

The only Lady Panther to drop a
singles match was sophomore Col-
leen Driscoll, who lost to Andrea
Benowitz 2-6. 3-6. Driscoll said she
was “outfinessed” by_ Benowitz but
vowed, “I'll revenge it at our next
match.”

That chance will come tomorrow

when the Lady Panthers play host to -

Washington & Jefferson at Trees
Courts. Match time is slated for 3:30"
