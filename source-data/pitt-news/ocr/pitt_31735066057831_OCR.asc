- Elections code plays large role

By Kevin Kramer
Staff Writer

With a disqualification and a write-in
candidate, the elections code has
played a larger role than expected in
this year’s Student Government Board

elections.

So at the presidential debate last
night, the registered candidates tried to
clean up the elections and highlight

their platforms.

  Shuttle

says Pitt

By Mark Gordon

News Assistant

Pitt’s shuttle system is
defending its reputation after
an accusation that it stole
riders from Port Authority
Transit, while assuring riders
there will be no change in
the Shadyside/Squirrel Hill
route.

“It’s Pitt’s position that we
are not stealing any riders
from the Port Authority,”
said John Morgan, Pitt’s
assistant director for trans-
portation.

Pitt is on the defensive
because of a Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette article on Oct.
29 that said the Port
Authority will not allow a
private bus company to pro-
vide service in the
Shadyside/Squirrel Hill area.
That private bus company is

according to Morgan, runs

they have to apply for a per-

Center to study domestic violence

By Lauren Sable
For The Pitt News

The Center for Injury Research and Control
(CIRCL) at the University of Pittsburgh has
received two grants to participate in a multi-
center study of domestic violence.

Pitt will conduct the study in conjunction
with the Johns Hopkins University, San
Francisco General Trauma Foundation and
Indiana University of Pennsylvania.

CIRCL received the grants, totaling 340,000
dollars, from the Center for Disease Control on
Oct. 3, 1994.

The two projects will focus on different areas
of domestic violence. One will focus on evalu-
ating the training ‘emergency room personnel
receive in identification and recognition of

domestic violence victims. The other will spe-
cialize in the evaluation of treatment programs
for men who abuse their wives or partners.
“Domestic violence is one of the most impor-
tant causes of serious injury in women. In 1990,
5,328 women in this country were victims of
homicide, and six out of every 10 of these
women were killed by their spouses or intimate
acquaintances,” said Dr. Jeff Coben, director of
CIRCL and an assistant professor of medicine
at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
The first grant is for a research project in
conjunction with colleagues at the Johns
Hopkins University and the San Francisco
Trauma Foundation.
The program will evaluate newly developed
programs geared toward training emergency

UPMC serves academically and medically

By Nicole Walz
For The Pitt News

Many hospitals occupy
Pitt’s campus, but most stu-
dents may not be aware of
how they relate to the univer-
sity.

The University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center

(UPMC) is composed of.

Presbyterian University
Hospital along with Falk
Clinic, Montefiore

University Hospital with Eye
and Ear Pavilion, Western
Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic, the Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute and the schools of
the health ‘sciences.

“All of the hospitals are
academic medical centers
with research and treatment

functions,” said Jane
Duffield, director of the news
bureau for UPMC.

The students are probably
most familiar with the six

schools of health sciences —
medicine, nursing, health-
related professions, dental
medicine, pharmacy and the
Graduate School of Public
Health.

“Getting a hands-on expe-
rience inside the hospital has
been a good learning oppor-
tunity for me,” said senior
Jennifer Dolan, a clinical
dietetics and nutrition major.
“I really enjoy interacting
with the patients.”

Montefiore is a full med-
ical and surgical hospital
which is in conjunction with
The Eye and Ear Institute
Pavilion. The institute spe-
cializes not only in eye, ear,
nose and throat treatments
but also head and neck can-
cer, balance disorders and
maxillofacial surgery.

LONDON — Researchers
announced yesterday the start
of tests on a possible cancer
vaccine which uses the
patient’s DNA to help protect
the body.

Cancer vaccine tests are
already underway in many
countries, but scientists from
the Cancer ’ Research
Campaign said theirs was the
first to employ DNA in pre-
venting the disease.

It is hoped that the vaccine
will stimulate the body’s
immune system into attack-
ing tumors. Since the vaccine
would use the immune sys-
tem, scientists said it
shouldn’t cause any side
effects. — Reuters

Moments before

WASHINGTON — The U.S.
Supreme Court was urged
yesterday by a Clinton
administration lawyer to

uphold a law barring posses-
sion of firearms near schools.

Drew Days, the administra-
tion’s chief advocate before
the court, told the justices
that Congress acted within its
constitutional powers by
adopting the law.

The 1990 law which makes
it illegal to have a firearm
within 1,000 feet of a school
was struck down by a U.S.
appeals court in New
Orleans.

At question is whether
Congress has the authority to
pass the law or whether it is a
local concern. — Reuters

WASHINGTON — With 35
of 100 Senate seats and all
435 seats in the House of

A large voter turnout tradi-
tionally helps Democrats,
analysts said, and if there is a
poor turnout, Republicans
will likely benefit. .— Reuters

or so members of the
Baha’i Student Organization
with students from Pitt,
Carnegie Mellon University,
Duquesne University and
Chatham College.

“You do not have to be a
Baha’i to attend the meet-
ings,” said Mahboobeh
Safaeian, one of the group’s
members who hopes to
expand membership here on
campus.

“Fifteen years ago there
was a Baha’i group on cam-
pus which was very active,”
Safaeian said. “Just now
we’ve finally had enough stu-
dents to start the group up
again.”

“To be a Baha’i, you have
to say ‘I’m a Baha’i,”’ she
said. “Just because you are
raised as a Baha’i doesn’t
mean you are one. You must
believe it.”

Baha’i faith was founded a
century and a half ago and is
among the fastest growing of
world religions.

In only a century, the
Baha’i faith has become the
second-most widespread reli-
gion after Christianity, with
members from virtually every
nation, culture, ethnic group,

profession and social or eco-

nomical class.

The essential message of
Baha’u’llah, a Persian noble-
man from Teheran, is unity.

The faith follows
Baha’u’llah’s writings, which
include a few long works and
15,000 documents called
“Tablets”, which currently are
translated into 802 languages.

“To deny one religion is to
deny all religions,” said
Safaeian, who like all Baha’is
works toward the oneness of
humankind, equality of men
and women, racial integra-
tion, economic justice, uni-
versal education, the harmony
of science and religion, the
adoption of a universal auxil-
iary language and the estab-
lishment of a world federal
system based on collective
security.

“We are like a little U.N.,”
she said.

Lucien Randazzese, a grad-
uate student at CMU and one
of the group’s members, said
it is not at all difficult to be so
open-minded. “I couldn’t
imagine it otherwise,” he
said. “Interracial marriages
have always been encouraged
by Baha’i faith.”

to church,” said Randazzese.

“We have our own unique
calendar for activities which
has 19 months each with 19
days,” he said. “On the first
day of each month we have a
feast, usually held at some-
one’s house.”

Each week the Baha’i
Association and a guest
speaker hold meetings where
they discuss topics that will
help spread their faith.

One recent guest, Bernal

kids.”

“It was my choice,’ said
one of the group’s members,
Jamila Bookwala. “That was
what I found so fascinating
about the Baha’i faith.”

“We study 24 hours a day,”
said Randazzese. “Excellence
in all things is a Baha’i funda-
mental.”

There are more than
5,000,000 Baha’is worldwide,
with about 50 in the Greater
Pittsburgh area.

Institute looks to remedy
problems of inner-city

By Fred Bigelow
For The Pitt News

Pi.tt’s Institute for the Black Family “will become a
national resource for remedying problems of our inner
cities,” according to Jerome Taylor, co—director.

“The mission of IBF is to enhance the viability of
black families through research, program, policy and
training initiatives,” said Taylor.

There are four areas of research related to the insti-
tute’s interest in viability: cultural identity, spiritual ori-
entation, wellness and relational intimacy, according to
Taylor.

“Upwards of 33 percent of blacks identify with white
racist conceptions of blacks as mentally deficient and
physically gifted,” said Taylor.

“We are studying the implications of radical separa-
tion from one’s culture of origin,” said Taylor. “It is
associated with high levels of alcohol consumption,
depressive symptoms, heightened aggression, low self-
esteem and impaired relationships.”

According to Taylor, IBF is formulating some “libera-
tory strategies” that go to the remedy.

The institute has been looking at spiritual orientation
in relation to problems in the black community, said co-
director Huberta Jackson—Lowman.

“We’ve been working on a study which looked at

ing with us in our class-
rooms and sharing com-
mon incidents of success

and failure.

Questions about words
and terms are often impor-
tant to clarify. Diversity,
affirmative action, equity
and non-discrimination are
related but different.
Affirmative action allows
us to address issues of mis-
representation. Making
strong and continued
efforts to attract and retain
groups of people who have
been denied access to
opportunity is a necessary
step toward creating an
environment that is excit-
ing and nourishing because
of its diversity. These envi-
ronments are able to set
goals which mandate fair-
ness in rewards and pun-
ishments and are capable
of evolving in order to
accommodate new realities
and relationships.

“Are we making progress
or are we sliding back-
wards?” is the question
asked after an attempt to
struggle with a new opin-
ion or behavior has result-
ed in strained or severed
communications. If the slo-
gan “no pain. no 
makes sense in physical
exercise, isn’t it a good

guideline for emotional
and intellectual growth as
well? '

The recent Minority
Education and Professional
D e v e 1 o p m e n t
Opportunities Conference
exposed our campus to
dozens of young people
from historically black col-
leges and universities all
over the country. They
watched our faculty and
students try, sometimes
succeeding and sometimes
failing, and they took away
with them a very positive
sense of who we are.
“These students had the
same dreams and motiva-
tion that I also had, but
what is most important is
that these students repre-
sent the future breed of sci-
entists of minority origin,”
stated Juan Ramon Feliz
from Long Island
University. Primrose
Musingarimi of Howard
University wrote, “It was
an incredible" and unforget-
table weekend  [and it]

sion about the graduate
school I would like to

ing examinations in the emer-
gency room for many reasons.
One reason is that women feel
threatened by spouses or pos-
sible retribution to their chil-
dren if they disclose that their
injuries are from abuse.

Emergency departments are
also very crowded and not
very private. The atmosphere
is not conducive for develop-

ing a patient-doctor relation-

ship.

Emergency personnel are
also not always trained to rec-
ognize the signs to detect and
to start intervention to break
the cycle of abuse and to let
the women know there are

other options such as shelters.
The Pennsylvania Coalition
Against Domestic Violence
and Family Violence
Prevention Fund in California
are two organizations which
have developed training pro-
grams for hospital emergency
departments better to recog-
nize the signs of domestic vio-

spouses or partners.

“With the increase in domes-
tic violence, there have been
projects established to counsel
men who are abusing their
partners and how to stop it,”
said Coben.

These programs are very
similar, yet very different.
Some programs are three

“Our project will be to eval-

The study will require three
years. There will be six hospi-
tals in Pennsylvania and six
hospitals in California
involved. Half of the hospitals
will receive the training and
the other half will not. The rate
of detection will be measured
in each hospital as well as the
effects of the detection.

Refreshments served.

Some are required by the
courts, and some are volun-
tary. Some are closely linked
with shelters, police or crimi-
nal justice.

“The bottom line is nobody
really knows if they work in
prohibiting further abuse and
threats,” said Coben.

The second project, which
will also take three years, will
study four different types of
programs and compare them.
Two hundred men will be
studied at each site.

The men, as well as their
partners, will be followed over
time to determine whether the
programs make a difference in
their relationships.

Coben, who graduated from
the University of Pittsburgh
Medical School in-1984, has
been with UPMC since 1990,
where he was first an attending
physician in the emergency
room of UPMC. He then
developed and established
CIRCL during 1990-92.

CIRCL, was selected for the
grants out of 94 applicants. Of
the seven grants awarded,
CIRCL will be participating in
two of them.

CIRCL’s approach is unusual,
because domestic violence will
be approached as a medical,
not a social, issue.

“Injuries, intentional and
unintentional, are a major pub-
lic health problem which
needs to be approached as a
disease,” said Coben.

By approaching domestic
violence as a medical, not
social, problem, CIRCL will
identify risk factors and high
risk groups in order to develop
programs to implement and
evaluate.

In the past, many programs
have approached domestic vio-
lence in conjunction with
criminal justice systems.

“There are a number of bat-
terer programs around the
country, but little has been
done to determine which
approach is most effective in
reducing domestic violence
and injury to women,” said
Coben. “Our ultimate goal is
to end the cycle of domestic
violence and to prevent further
abuse and injury.”

Elections

°From page I
pate in last night’s debate, but she did
pose a question to the candidates.

Scardamalia asked why the student
government board had such a negative
attitude toward her as a write-in candi-
date.

But both Crowell and Golden dis-
agreed with Scardamalia and men-
tioned that her status was due to her
own actions. ~

‘‘If you consider yourself a serious
candidate, you could have done the
same as Heath and I did,” said Crowell
in response to her question.

Golden said, “The elections code was
established, and every student with a
2.5 QPA had the option of running for
president.”

Elections Committee Chair Heather
Heinrichs explained that all registered
candidates needed to file a petition and
application with the committee by a
deadline. She said Scardamalia did not
meet the deadline and was unable to
become a registered candidate.

Though Golden and Crowell agreed

in the area concerning the elections and
candidates, they expressed differences
in other areas, particularly Pitt’s
Master Space Plan.

Golden, during his term on Pitt’s
Student Government Board, said he has
focused on the creation of a lower-
campus intramural recreational facility.
He said the facility, which will include
a huge weight room and indoor track,
will improve the quality of life on cam-
pus.

“It will be a building that builds
character as well as fitness,” Golden
said. “It is also a great recruiting tool
for students interested in coming to
Pitt.” .

Crowell, on the other hand, said the
building of a campus multi-cultural
center is more important than an athlet-
ic facility.

“Right now, we don’t have an
African Cultural Center or a Women’s
Center,” said Crowell.

As a member of PACWC, the
Provost’s Advisory Committee for
Women’s Concerns, Crowell said she

has helped to define the proposed
Campus Women’s Center.

Though she said there would be no
problem sharing a building with other
cultural groups, she is unsure as to how
they would respond.

“We have to find out if each group
will accept having one floor. They may
want an entire building,” said Crowell.

But Golden discussed the problems
he has with the culture center. “We
can’t just throw up a building in
Oakland because everybody wants
one,” he said. “Space is a hard thing to
find.”

Though Crowell said she was pleased
with last night’s turnout of about 100
students, she was disappointed with the
passivity of the audience.

Some of the questions posed by the
audience dealt with combating student
apathy and the discrimination which is
being used by Pitt’s Reserve Officer
Training Corps program.

The ROTC policy of discrimination
against homosexuals is not in compli-
ance.with the university’s policy.

Morgan said.
Morgan said Pitt’s
Department of

Transportation wrote a letter
to the Post-Gazette, outlin-
ing the mistakes in their
story.

“The article was an embar-
rassing misrepresentation of
the facts regarding the provi-
sion of shuttle services
between Squirrel Hill and
Shadyside and the
University of Pittsburgh,”
Morgan said. “The Port
Authority gave the Lenzner
Coach Lines an eight-month
extension through May 1,
1995.”

The P0st—Gazette reported
that PAT did not give per-
mission to Lenzner because
the routes competed with
their own. The story also
said that due to the pending
sale of Lenzner, PAT is in a
position to halt the new
company’s right to provide
service in the area because
the state Public Utility
Commission grants them the
right to approve any new
operating agreement.

The letter, signed by Vice
Chancellor for Student and
Public Affairs Leon Haley,
also said that Lenzner is not
stealing any riders from PAT.

“The vast majority of the
riders are University of
Pittsburgh students and
employees who access the
shuttle service on the exist-
ing and approved routes in
order to attend class and for
university-related employ-
ment,” Morgan said.

Morgan said he wanted to
assure the Pitt community
that the Squirrel
Hill/Shadyside shuttle bus
will continue to run and the
only change that would take
place before May 1 would be
the addition of busses to the
route.

“We propose to add addi-
tional service. We will prob-
ably run another bus to han-
dle the excess load,” Morgan
said.

Morgan also said Pitt plans
to talk with PAT too and
work out future agreements.

“We are in discussions
with PAT to try and come to
a solution,” Morgan said.

Opinions

Justice department errs

Everyone has heard the story. In Union County, S.C., two
young boys, 3-year-old Michael and l4-month—o1d Alexander
Smith, were buried on Sunday. The boys drowned in their
mother’s car on Oct. 25. The story made national news as the
mother, Susan Smith, fabricated a story of carjacking.
However, the news was even bigger when it was revealed that,
in all likelihood, she is responsible for the murders.

This story has shocked the nation, added to our already ram-
pant concern for crime and virtually demanded a response from
the upper echelons of the Justice Department. Well, they
responded, and they did so with what threatens to be a bigger
miscarriage of justice than the actions of one delinquent moth-
er.

The guidelines issued on Sunday by the Justice Department
say that law enforcement officials should assume foul play in
every missing-child case and that parents should be given poly-
graph tests as soon as is practical. Furthermore, the manual
suggests the early use of polygraphs because suspects or par-
ents may not yet sense an “accusatory purpose.”

These guidelines raise a number of legal and moral issues. It
is not wrong to assume foul play in every missing—child case, to
respond “as if the child is in immediate danger.” However,
attempting to administer lie detector tests to parents is patently
ridiculous and a violation of the parents’ civil rights.

First, attempting to use lie detector tests in this situation is
irresponsible. It has been proven that lie detectors are not com-
pletely reliable, especially in situations of high stress. Now cor-
rect us if we’re wrong, but if one’s children have disappeared,
this strikes us as a high stress situation for the parents. This
thereby makes the results from a polygraph even more ques-
tionable than they would normally be.

Secondly, to use these tests for an “accusatory purpose” or
what may potentially be an accusatory purpose, before arrest-
ing someone as a suspect, is a violation of civil rights. We do
not live in a police state. Law enforcement officials should not
be allowed to administer lie detector tests at will. Whatever
happened to innocent until proven guilty?

Certainly there are some situations in which parents commit
foul play against their children. But in the vast majority of
cases, the parents will have no knowledge of what has actually
happened and will be in a very distraught state. To allow and
encourage the police to act in an accusatory rather than sympa-
thetic manner is the height of irresponsibility. Also, consider
the consequences when an innocent parent fails a polygraph.

There is no other crime, let alone suspected crime, for which
police are allowed to start acting in such an accusatory manner
without any evidence. The incident in S.C. was a tragedy, made
all the more vivid because it involved innocent children. But let
us not violate their memory by allowing the federal govern-
ment to use this case to prey upon our fears and to take away
our civil rights.

.;_:China in 1972,
Taiwan’s diplo-
matic star

Columnist began its decent
 9 into being con-
. sidered a non-
country by the
international community. Only
a handful of nations risked
offending Beijing by establish-
ing ofﬁcial diplomatic relations
with the Republic of China. In
1972 the P.R.C. took over
Taiwan’s seat on the United
Nations Security Council, and
Taiwan was kept from admis-
sion into the UN. China fur-
ther had its international reputa-
tion boosted in 1978 by estab-
lishing diplomatic relations
with the U.S. after a visit to
Washington by Deng Xiaoping.
In the nearly two decades
since then, Taiwan’s govern-
ment and its people have
focused on economic develop-
ment and political reforms
which have brought the nation
to the brink of democracy. In
fact, by 1996 all public offices,
including the presidency, will
be elected by the people.
Despite massive amounts of
propaganda from both Beijing
and Taibei, the people of
Taiwan seemed content to work
hard and to improve their stan-
dard of living. With that goal
nearly complete, there are signs
that Taiwan will not remain‘
content with its isolation from
international organizations
indeﬁnitely. ‘
From Taiwan’s perspective, it
is not difficult to see why the

people clamor for indepen- I

dence. Taiwan is a nation of 21
million people that has become
one of East Asia’s “four tigers.”
In many ways, Taiwan has
more in common with the other

three tigers of Singapore, Hong

 

Kong and South Korea than it
does with China. There are two
reasons for this: one is econom-
ics and the other is culture. In
1992, Taiwan’s per capita
income was $11,000, and the
government had $90 billion in
foreign exchange reserves. In
1993, Taiwan became the
world’s 14th-largest trading
economy and has begun to ﬂex
its muscles in Asia by investing
heavily in southern China and
the Newly Industrialized
Countries (NIC’s).

From recent surveys in
Taiwan, it appears that an
increasing number of its citi-
zens are listening to what used
to be considered a radical inde-
pendence party. While the num-
bers are still relatively small,
the most recent polls report that
27% of Taiwan’s people now
support full independence,
which is an all-time high (The
Wall Street Journal 10/3/94).

, The question that comes to
‘mind when looking at these sta-

tistics is: why the increase in
the number of people calling for
independence?

'1 believe that this is where
culture and socialization come
into play. Over 90% of
Taiwanese were born in
Taiwan, and many of them have
never even been to the main-
land to visit. These people
clearly do not have the same
sense of longing for the “home-
land” as the older generations
once did. Secondly, while
Taiwanese are ethnic Chinese,
they have their own distinct cul-
ture, a different dialect of
Chinese and a completely dif-
ferent set of Chinese writing
characters.

But the most profound differ-
ences lie in the fact that
Taiwan’s young people have
grown up in a much more afﬂu-
ent and open society, and this
has affected the way that they
look at both themselves and
their country. It is this cultural
background and a grow

I .

   

ing

desire for nationalism among
the youth that is fueling their
desire to see a Taiwan that is
not diplomatically isolated from
the world community.

These feelings are starting to
trickle down into politics. Since
last Sept., Taiwan has made two
formal bids to join the U.N. On
Sept. 21 this year, the U.N.
General Committee refused to
include the R.O.C. bid from the
General Assembly agenda. This
latest rejection, however, is not
likely to stop the government
from pursuing Taiwan’s admis-
sion into both the U.N. and the
World Trade Organization. This
political activity has been spear-
headed by a government white
paper which expressed the view
that Taiwan wants to be recog-
nized as a “sovereign political
entity” that can join intemation-
al organizations.

One thing that must be
included in this debate is how
China will react to these
changes should they eventually
occur. I think that as long as
China is admitted into the WTO
before Taiwan, Beijing will not
react with anything more than
some derogatory rhetoric.
However, I do not believe that
the Chinese government will
agree to Taiwan’s admittance
into the U.N. while the remain-
ing hard-liners are still alive. As
for Taiwan’s declaring indepen-
dence, it should be remembered
that China has very strong and
valid feelings about Taiwan.
The Chinese have considered
Taiwan to be part of the main-
land since it was repatriated in
the Qing dynasty. The govem-
ment, and many of the people,
still consider it to be a province
of China. China has long
declared that it would invade if
Taiwan claims independence. I
don’t think that time or eco-
nomic development will make
that threat any less real.

Alabama and Auburn can
pass Saturday’s tuneups
against Mississippi State
and Georgia, their Nov. 19
season-ending showdown in
the Tiger’s “Busted Bowl”
will be the first game with
final AP poll implications.

If the underrated Crimson
Tide win, they’d still have
to win their bowl game for a
shot at the national title.

But if Auburn wins, it’s
22-0 record the past two
seasons, coupled with wins
over Florida and ‘Bama this
season would put it into
position to share the nation-
al championship.

And considering how
close to the paw Auburn has
had to play it under the
eagle eye of NCAA proba-
tion, that 22-0 record is
awfully impressive.

A lotmore impressive
than the eleven-course meal
the Nittany Lions have been
dining on this season.

Penn State will beat
Arizona, Oregon, or
Southern Cal in the Rose
Bowl to go 12-0.

None of the teams the
Lions beat will finish the
season with fewer than
three losses.

Even if they are the only
unbeaten, untied team in the
country after Jan.1, I
wouldn’t give’em the title
with a patsy schedule like
that.

Because provided there’s
not a major upset, unbeaten
Nebraska and once-beaten
Miami are scheduled to
meet in the Orange Bowl.

If Nebraska wins, they
stay atop both polls and win
the national title.

But a Miami win, along
with the Florida State win
would give them enough
clout to hop PSU into the
top spot.

Even Florida and Florida
State hold outside shots at
the title. And if the winner
of the Nov. 26 meeting in
Tallahassee wins its’ bowl
game, l’d jump them over
Penn State.

You wanna know why?

Because Penn State sucks.

Bobby and Mike Dyer continue Pitt tradition

Mike Dyer saw his brother,
Bobby, get into a scramble
with a large Seton Hall play-
er. Noticing the player about
to blindside Bobby, Mike
jumped in and knocked him
over

Teammates always look out
for one another, but when

“I thought it was a neat lit-

Between these brothers
there is a friendship and not
much of a rivalry.

Mike and Bobby’s mother,
Carolyn Dyer, said she and
her husband, Jerry, worried
about the problem of a rival-

last year and discussed it
with both of them before-
hand.

“There’s always a rivalry
between brothers, but they’re
also really good friends,” she
said.

Adelman is living the dream of his

team, received the telephone call he’d
been aching to get.

The call came from first-year coach at
Loyola, Chicago, Ken Burmeister.
Burmeister told Adelman that a vacan-
cy on the coaching staff was his for the
taking.

“I told him ‘I’ll be in tomorrow,”’
Adelman said.

Suddenly, four months removed from
college graduation at the age of 23,
Adelman had achieved what he’d been
striving toward for most of the last
decade. He became an assistant basket-
ball coach at a Division I school.

The next time Adelman picked up the
phone, it was to call his good friend and
mentor David Kaplan.

“He was so excited. All he said was,
‘I’m a Division I coach,”’ Kaplan said.
“He was absolutely elated.”

It was appropriate Adelman, a native
of Highland Park, Ill., chose to call
Kaplan first. Kaplan, who runs a bas-
ketball scouting service in Illinois
called The Windy City Roundball
Review, was instrumental in Adelman
landing his new position.

Adelman met Kaplan when he was 14

years old at_a summerhoop camp prior _

David Adelman was a Pitt student man-
ager for ﬁve years.

to his freshman year in high school.
Kaplan was his camp coach. The fol-
lowing summer Adelman determined
his calling in life was to be a basketball
coach.

After spending the next year working
with the Marquette University camp, he
was ready to join Kaplan’s staff. It
wasn’t long before he became the assis-
tant director, working from 7:30 in the
morning to 7 at night at Kaplan’s sum-
mer camp, which attracts the top high
school players in the Midwest.

“Every summer my responsibilities
grew,” Adelman said. “This summer we
were almost doing it together I was
doing so much.”

The responsibilities heaped on
Adelman included every aspect of the
camp. Kaplan still refers to Adelman as
his “right hand man.”

When Adelman was choosing a col-
lege, he looked for a school that had an
up—and-coming basketball program. In
1989, that program was Pitt. He spent
five years as a student manager with the
Panthers under former head coach Paul
Evans and his staff.

That’s where Adelman developed his
coaching methods and his knowledge of
the intricacies of the game.

“He’s a great evaluator of talent,”
Kaplan said. “He can look at a high
school player and tell you if he can play
at the level he’s coaching.”

Evans trusted Adelman enough to uti-
lize him as a scout of the strengths and
weaknesses of Pitt’s opposition.

“He could give a scouting report as
well as any of the coaches,” Steve
Buchman, the Panthers’ current-head
manager, said.

“I can’t ever express in words how
[the former Pitt coaches] treated me,”
Adelman said. “They never treated me
like some punk manager. They always
explained to me the philosophies of
basketball.”

But Adelman’s time at Pitt wasn’t all
work. There were periods where the
managers and players got to enjoy the
moment.

“On our manager staff, there was a lot
of freedom,” Adelman said. “Coach
Evans really allowed us to be social and
have fun socially.”

There was the 1991 road trip to

Soccer star Prex

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

One of the brightest
careers in Pitt soccer history
has come to an end. Senior
forward Eric Prex has played
his last game for the blue
and gold.

In his farewell season,
Prex was pursuing two goals
that have not been

approached in quite a few

years.
In the first goal, the single
season assist record of 12 set
by Dave DeEmido in 1969,
Prex fell
just short

son with

“ I

something nice to attain,”
Prex said of the career goals
record. “It didn’t happen, but
so much good has happened
to me at Pitt that I can’t
complain.”

The second and most illus-
trious record, which is Pitt’s
career goals, is held by Pitt
head coach Joe Luxbacher
with 35. Prex finished his
career with 29 goals and 26
assists for 55 points.

“I was closer to getting the

assists record,” Prex said.
“But neither record was a top
priority for me. Personal
records happen but only with
a great team behind you.”

Once again, Prex finished
the season as the leading
scorer on the Pitt team. This
was the third out of four
years that Prex accomplished
this. In 1991, Prex scored
seven goals and three assists
to finish with 17 points. The
following season, Prex fin-
ished with 28 points, 10
goals and eight assists. Prex
did not lead the team in scor-
ing last season because of a
broken arm that hampered
him during the season. He
finished with four goals and
four assists.

Being coached by the man
that he was chasing in the
scoring race has proven to be
a positive experience for
Prex.

“He [Luxbacher] priori-
tizes things well,” Prex said.
“He has helped me a lot; he
has always kept me
focused.”

“Eric felt pressure to carry
the team this season,”
Luxbacher said. “He felt he
had to be the one to win
games for us.”

In the disappointing season
that Pitt had this year (9-8-1
overall, 1-6-1 conference),

to the NCAA tournament,”
Prex said. “None of that hap-
pened this year, and that is
what is really disappoint-
ing.”

Prex started off the season
by scoring the game-winning
goal in Pitt’s first two games
of the season against
Bucknell and Buffalo.

Perhaps the lowest point of
Prex’s senior season came in
his last home game against
Syracuse. The game ended in
a 0-0 tie. However, Prex had
two penalty kicks, one in
overtime that could have
won the game, and missed
them both. ‘

“I felt responsible for that
whole game,” Prex said. “I
make those shots in my
sleep, and I didn’t. The hard-
est practice of my life was
the very next day, going and
facing my team. It was real
hard for me to swallow.”

Prex got over the Syracuse
loss and scored what turned
out to be the final goal of his
collegiate career in the sec-
ond half versus Slippery
Rock. The Panthers won the
game 3-0.

The final game of his col-
legiate career was against
arch-rival Penn State. Pitt
lost the game 4-0, but it was
an emotional day for Prex.

that we pretty much accom-
plished the same things.”

“We’re both better in dif-
ferent ways,” said Bobby, a
senior and tri-captain of the
team. “I think I’m a better
athlete. I think he’s a better
soccer player.”

Luxbacher said both are
top players and starters for
the team. Bobby, the sweep-
er, has had eight shots, with
one assist this season. Mike,
a sophomore midfielder, had
12 shots, one goal and five
assists for a total of seven
points.

“Both are good at what
they do,” Luxbacher said.

He said the difference
between the two is that
Bobby is more laid-back
while Mike has a shorter
fuse.

Off the field, both brothers
agree that there are the occa-
sional fights and arguments,
but nothing too serious.

“We get along pretty well.
We don’t really fight too
much,” Mike said.

The Dyer brothers started
playing soccer when Bobby
was 7 and Mike was 5. Mike
started because of Bobby and
played on his team.

As they were growing up,
they both played for
Beadling Soccer Club teams.
Then they played for Peters
Township High School in
McMurray, Pa.

from home in McMurray, has

Bobby and Mike grew up
attending Pitt football and
basketball games.

“Bobby and Michael were
some of the few [Pitt] kids at
the 1981 Sugar Bowl,” she
said.

Mike said his

cessfully in the collegiate
ranks, he said.

Bobby and Mike also
spend time playing soccer
with their two younger
brothers, Jeff, 16, and Joey,
13.

“We all love soccer  it’s
a family affair,” Carolyn
Dyer said.

She said the high school’s
soccer field is almost in their
backyard, two minutes away,
and they always play there.

They said the younger
brothers probably have antic-
ipations about coming to
Pitt.

“After our games, they
both like to go down on the
turf.”

“They always look out for
their younger brothers,”
Carolyn Dyer said. “The
younger kids absolutely love
going down to their apart-
ment and spending the night.

a strong sense of family,”
she said. .

Prex

°Frompage 10

“I was real excited to
play against Penn State,”
Prex said.

“I have always had some
bad feelings towards them,
because I was recruited by
them and then they just
lost interest in me.”

Prex, who hails from
nearby Chartiers Valley
High School, chose Pitt
because of location.

“My family comes to all
the games,” Prex said.
“They like to watch me
play.’’

Prex, majoring in biolog-
ical sciences, will stick
around Pitt next year to
complete his collegiate
degree.

“Up until now there has

always been next year and ,

the next year,” Prex said.
“There isn’t that now, but I
do know that I have anoth-
er year of school left.”

“I will miss soccer a lot,”
Prex said. “There is no
next year for me. I’m start-
ing to realize now that I
am really going to miss it.”

Teammate. Bobby Dyer,
also a senior, has played
with Prex for four years.
The two of them have
shared the good times and
the bad.

The best of times for the
two of them were in 1992
when the Panthers set a
school single-season
record for victories (12)
and advanced to the Big
East tournament.

The Pitt News, Wednesday November 9, 1994

“Eric has understood his
role as a player in the last
four years,” Dyer said.

“He has provided stabili-
ty up front. He has helped
a lot of guys come along,
especially the first year
guys.”

“With Eric, you knew
that he would be ready,”
Luxbacher said. “You
could count on him for
four years.”

The future for the Pitt
soccer team is uncertain,
but the one guarantee is
that its cornerstone for the
past few years will be
missing.

“We have a big gap to
fill,’’ Luxbacher said. “Not
just Eric, but all five great
seniors.”

“Our parents could make
our games, and we could
make our little brothers’
games. We go to them all the
time,” said Bobby.

Next year the Dyer family
will only be coming to see
one Dyer son play at Pitt,
since Bobby is graduating.

“I don’t have any regrets.
Joe [Luxbacher’s] a good
guy, and he’s a good coach. I
got to play with all my
friends,” Bobby said. “I
wanted to come to Pitt. We
both "had different options;
we could have gone other
places.”

Luxbacher said he will
miss.Bobby, as well as the
other seniors, since they are
the cornerstone of the team.

“I definitely will [miss
Bobby next year.] I think
we’re losing some good guys
this year, including my
brother. I’m going to miss

playing with them,” Mike
said.

Bobby, a rhetoric and com-
munications major, said,
“There are a couple of
options still with soccer to
go. Whether I take them I
don’t know yet — still up in
the air.”

Whatever he does, he said
he plans on coming to soccer
games next year.

“I’ll probably live down
here. Even if I move back to
home or wherever, I’m not
going to leave the area,”
Bobby said.

With both of them playing
together on the team, neither
of them have regrets.

“I’m definitely glad I
played with Bobby. I defi-
nitely did enjoy playing with
him. We both played in the
back; I thought that was
fun,” Mike said.

Bobby agreed. “It’s been a
very enjoyable experience,
and I’m very glad we both
made the decision to do it.”

Adelman

°Frompage9

Syracuse where Pitt got
blown out by the Orangemen
on national television. After
the game, Pitt center Darren
Morningstar threw his shoes
around the room in frustra-
tion. Morningstar left his
shoes lying on the locker
room floor. The managers
gathered them up and later
hid them fromhim.

Later in the trip,
Morningstar ransacked his
room looking for the shoes
and had to board the bus to a
game at Boston College in
front of the coaching staff in
just his warmup suit and
socks. It was 10 degrees out-
side.

“That really taught him a
lesson that he shouldn’t

leave his stuff lying around,”t

Adelman said.

Adelman’s fondest experi-
ences at Pitt were being asso-
ciated with Pitt’s 1991 trip to
the NCAA tournament and
the Panthers 18-point trounc-
ing of Kentucky in Rupp
Arena the following year.

“The experience we got
and the experience those
coaches gave me, I don’t
think many regular students
could get that,” Adelman
said.

“He’s a die—hard Pitt guy,”

Kaplan said. “He absolutely
loved his five years there.”
Adelman said that man-
agers play a bigger part of
the team than most people
expect and that theyjare as
knowledgeable as the players
about what is going on with-
in the team. »
“When you have a team,

“I don’t think you can get a
job without knowing some-
body, but you also have to
know what you’re doing,”
Buchman said.

When Burmeister inter-
viewed Adelman for the job,
Evans called to voice his
approval. Kaplan also spoke
to Burmeister in support of

“If I hadn't done what I did for coach
Evans and Pitt, there is no way I could

even fathom getting a job in college bas-

ketball.”

— Loyola assistant coach

you have a family,” Adelman
said.

“You’re on the road, at
practice and in the offices
with the coaches. You really
feel like you’re a member of
the team.”

Today, a few weeks away
from coaching his first game,
Adelman still has to remind
himself how far he has risen
in such a short time. Yet, he
had plenty of support to help
him get where he is now.

Adelman’s aptitude.

“He’s the hardest worker
I’ve ever seen,” Kaplan said.
“He doesn’t know the mean-
ing of the word relaxation.
Most people you have to
motivate to work, I have to
get him to back off.”

“I would never want to be
terrible at something,”
Adelman said. “Everybody
tells you how well you’re
doing and all of the sudden
you’re in a room with eight

college coaches and you real-
ize you’re not even halfway
good yet.”

Adelman’s job is a restrict-
ed earnings one and he isn’t
allowed to do off-campus
recruiting, but he is loaded
with responsibilities. In addi-
tion to the on-court coaching,
Adelman runs summer bas-
ketball camps, handles
recruiting on-campus, works
on promotions and scouting
and has to keep track of
player academics.

“If I hadn’t done what I did
for coach Evans and Pitt,
there is no way I could even
fathom getting a job in col-
lege basketball,” Adelman
said.

But, being an assistant,
Adelman is only halfway
toward the only goal he’s
ever gone after ——- becoming
a head coach.

“You have to be true to
yourself,” Adelman said.
“Players see through
phoneys. They see your true
personality.” "

“The thing about David is,
I’d let my son play for him,”
Kaplan said. “He’s got a
great personality. There’s not
a cocky bone in his body.

“I think David Adelman
will be a‘Division I head
