Chancellor Previews

, _ By DONNA CONSIDINE
In his Inaugural Address last Saturday, Dr. Edward H.

expressed his readiness to accept both the authority and the
responsibilities of his position. , V ' _

Speaking of our aim to make this University one of the
nationiis ﬁnest he stressed the importance of regarding it
asa total institution. “Each faculty functions as part of a whole univer-
sitv. Each student lives in an academic World greater than his own
college. Each administrator and each trustee must serve a total edu-
cational program, and not merely the speciﬁc portions in which he
may have the greatest personal interest.” a

“The Function_s of a Modern‘ University” was the first of,.D.I‘.
Litchﬁeld’s three main points. He stated that large l.1l’ll.V:eI‘SltleS.d1ffeI‘
greatly in their concepts in that some emphasize teaching and lgnore

He added, “Some are attentive to their community responsibilities,
. . Some are dedicated to teaching

merit.” . V _ . . -
According to the chancellor ﬁve functions performed by. univer-

new horizons; development of new insightsiand values; integration
of knowledge; and development of the whole student.

In relation to the imparting of knowledge, administrator found
that too often it crowds out the other functions. He believes that‘ the
discoverey of new knowledge should not be identiﬁed merely with
research, “whereas, it is a creative, intellectual process dealing with
philosophic, artistic, and speculative subjects of far broader con-
cern. Too often the professor turns to it after’ he has ﬁnished his
teaching.”

Citing the third function, that of applying knowledge, Dr. Litch-
ﬁeld observed that “Biologists knew that human blood could be typed
for almost a generation before blood transfusions came into general
practice of medicine. Thusia concept of the University as a total in-
stitufion should include the transitionpfrom discovery to application.”

‘Integration concerns the exchange of knowledge “from one the-
oretical area to another, as well as from the theoretical to the applied
areas” according to the chancellor. He pointed out that counselling
services and more non-classroom academic programs can help de-
velop the whole student. “The University must be concerned with
his personal values, social attitudes, emotional maturity, as well as
his intellectual abilities.” .

The newly inaugurated educator declared “We should be clearly
understood, then, as committing ourselves to undertake all ﬁve
functions.”

The second of his three main questions was “For Whom Does ~

the University Function?” He answered that in addition to the\.stu-
dents, “Our alumni certainly constitute another group toward which
we have responsibility. A man’s university would have much the
same role for his continued intellectual growth as his church has
for his spiritual growth and well-being.”

Litchﬁeld also advocates service to the professional areas
through cooperative research, joint seminars, informal communica-

tion between teacher and practitioner, libraries with facilities for

both students and professionals, etc. J 7

He suggests that the relationship between the university and a
new institution, the publicly held business corporation, should be
close and complementary and that their “claims on each other should
be reciprocal.” \ C 4

The chancellor’ went on to say “Next to the student body, our
most freely accepted responsibility is to the state. This is as it should
be.” Finally he explained that a university functions for the world of
scholarship. “It is at once each of the groups of which we have spok-
en, all of the groups combined, and the constantly unfolding world of
knowledge per se.”

The last question which the chancellor sought to answer was
“How Does the University Propose to Perform Its Function?” In his
ﬁrst point he stated “I propose that we commit .ourselves to the
proposition that every student be given both a liberal education and
professional training.” _ _

Dr. Litchﬁeld supported tri-mesters of ﬁfteen weeks each in the
school calendar.in order that a student may earn his degree in less
time.

Concerning the ﬁnanci_al situation he said, “It would be_far better-
for the student to forego those months of summer work at low rates
of compensation, to borrow‘ the money from loan funds established
for -the purpose, and—to merge into the professional world several
years earlier, and thus invest the time he has saved in work at ap-
preciably higher rates of return." ’

Talk 18 P tanned
By CSO Group
This  fternoon

“Our Present Family, Church,
and State Structures Should be
Replaced” is the topic for an open

noon at 3:30, in 144 CL.

‘Leader or the discussion is Don-
ald Nicolson, Col. ’57, who will
open the program with a brief
presentation of his views on the
subject.

Mr. Nicolson will attempt to
explain why these institutions are
inadequate for our present world
situation . and our subsequent
survival. His proposal for a solu-
tion is largely based upon Dr.
B. F. Skinner’s books, Walden
Two and Science and Human Be-
havior.

Plans are now under way to
establish an experimental society
in Cambridge, Mass., similar to
the ‘one proposed in Walden Two.
Following completion of his
graduate studies in psychology,
Nicolson intends to become a be-
haviorial engineer in this experi-
mental group. '

The discussion following his’
talk is open to students and fac-
ulty of the University. The pro-
gram is presented under the aus-
pices of the Council Of Scholastic
Organizations. '

First Loss

On Thinclads, 691/3 - 612/3

By STEVE BUTCHOCK ,

Two records fell at the Sta-
dium on Saturday, and Pan-
ther Coach Carl Olson gained
added prestige as the worst
track Kprognosticator of the
season (he predicted a Pitt
rout), but it still wasn’t enough to
stop Notre Dame from edging the
Blue and Gold tracksters, 691/3 to
612/3. ,

The ﬁrst record was shattered
on the initial track event of the
meet when the Fighting Irish’s
heralded mi-ler-Dick DiCamillo—-
Govered the distance in 4214.4 to
surpass the time of 4114.6 set by
ex-teammate
1954. An assist should be given to
Panther Jim Moore who pushed

DiCamillo for nearly the entire I"

distance before his ﬁnishing kick
tell just short of overtaking the
Irish ace. .
_ The second record was a little
-more pleasurable to the Blue and
Gold because it saw their big
weight man-—Wes King-re-es-
tablish a discus record he had set
earlier , in the season against
Miami .(Ohio). King arched the
"discus 156 feet, 41/2 inches to bet-
_,1;er his old mark by nearly seven‘
feet. ~
" Relay Decides Meet
a Another Panther surprise was
Ron‘ Siemon, a sophomore from
"Shaler Twp., who notched ﬁrst
place in the high jump with a
jump of 6 feet, 3 inches. This was
Siemon’s' best leap of the season.
iNotre Dame’s Jack Cote was sup-
posed to have had an easy time
in this event, but wound up third

The anchor lap matched Pan-
ther Charley Heﬂin against the

last lap, but the driving Panther

and into the homestretch, but the
jet-propelled Le w i s ’ blistering
tape drive opened the gap again to
about two yards for the vital win
which gave Notre Dame the meet.
The time was 3216.5.

One thing that could have
been an important factor in the
Panthers losing. the mile relay
was the fact that one of the
earlier runners had a chance
to pass the Irish runner imme-
diately" after he received the
baton. Instead, he elected to
save his kick for the long back-
stretch which put the locals ﬁt
a two-yard disadvantage going
into the anchor lap, the margin‘
of victory. ‘

Herb Carper appeared to be at
peak form again as he won the
100-yard dash in :09.7 from team-
mate Jim Donahue and Lewis.
The difference between Carper
and the third-place man was one

Cost’s Timely Hit Sparks
Will Over Mounties, 3-2

By MURRAY CHASS 

Corky Cost’s two—out double in the seventh inning on
Saturday enabled sophomore Bill Hamilton to make ‘West
_Virginia his third straightimound victim, 3-2,

The win at the Mountaineers’ park was the ninth of the
season for the Panther mittmen against seven losses.

In traveling the distance for his third victory against

only one setback Hamilton scat—¢

tered eight hits and walked three.
He struck out ﬁve. A Mountie
sophomore, shortstop Ronnie Ret-
ton, was the only opposing batter
to do any damage to Hamilton,
collecting three safeties and'scor-
ingt one of West Virginia’s two
runs.‘
VVild Throw Helpful

— -Both teams scored in the first

inning. With two men down in the
Panthers’ half of the ﬁrst, short-
stop Jim Dunlap socked a single
to left. ‘Joe Walton, who led the
local hitters with a double and
a pair of singles, moved Dunlap
to second with his first single.
Ron Hoover hit back to Ret-
ton at short whose throw to sec-
ond got away from Nick Zegrea,
and Dunlap came all the way
around to score. .
The Mountaineers went ahead
in the bottom of the initial frame
on just a couple of hits as Retton
and centerﬁelder Jim Senay tal-
lied. .
Cost Hits Double
Hamilton settled down after

this and shut out the home team
therest of the way. West Virginia
hurler Tom Cook was just as ef-
fective until the sixth inning
when the Panthers tied the gilme
at 2-2. In. this frame they put to-
gether two extra base blows for
their run. A .

Walton doubled, and then
Hoover drove him across with a
triple.

The Jungle Cats won it in the
next inning. After Cook had re-
tired ﬁrst baseman Mike ‘Tuchak,
Fred DeLost singled. Hamilton did
his part as he sacriﬁced the stocky
catcher to second. Then Cost, who
had been held hitless until that
point, unloaded his game-winning
two-base hit. '

The Panthers weren’t so for-
tunate in their contest withcity
rival, Duquesne, last .Wednesday
at Mellon‘ Field. The Dukes’ Fritz
Binder proved too much for Coach
Bobby Lewis’ nine as he held
them to three hits and struck out
15 in the 7-2 victory.

~Pitt, simultaneously with sev-
eral others of the nation’s schools
of social work, is,for the ﬁrst time
developing an undergraduate pro-
gram to give students a back-
ground for graduate study in so-
cial work and related ﬁelds.

As a result of intensive study.
a program has been mapped out
to offer a liberal arts education
‘ based on selected areas of study
which will provide the student
with an understanding of so-

ciety and its problems.

During freshman and sopho-
more years, undergraduate will
take at least two courses in Eng-
lish and a year of sociology, his-
tory, psychology, biology and eco-
nomics, plus electives in the social’
sciences as well as physical edu-
cation or military science.

During their last two‘ years -
in the program, students will
take social statistics, sociological
research and social agency in
the community.

Beginning in September of 1957, the School of Business¢

Bus. Ad. To Start New Curriculum

Administration will change from a four-year course to an

upper division course of two

years. The school will then

function in a manner similar to that of the School of Edu-

cation.

Business administration has made this change to strength-

en its program in the business:

education in liberal arts for its
professional students.

At the present time a student
in the School of Business must
have at least 40% of his credits in
a school other than business. The
new system will give the student
more liberal arts courses and will
help broaden his educational dis-
cipline experience.

Beneﬁts Listed

Vincent W. Lanfear, Dean of
the School of Business Admini-
stration, explains the beneﬁts of
the new program to the students.
“By the time‘ students are ready

~ to begin their business training, ,

they will have had two years in
which to adjust to. college life,
and will be that much more ma-
ture. "
“Students ‘who have found
themselves unsuited to -college
life and particularly those un-
suited to a career in business,
will have made their readjust-
ments during the ﬁrst two years
at Pitt. For this reason mem-
bers of the business administra-
tion faculty will have fewer
students and will have more
time for individual instruction
of members of their classes.”
The student will be able to tie
his courses in more closely with
the liberal arts approach since he
will have a background in liberal
arts. This background will» help
him in his business studies.

Two Years In College . ,
By having the student enter the
School of Business at the begin- ‘
ning of his junior year, the school
will know the student’s abilities
from his first two years of aca-
demic work in the College. -It can,
therefore, upgrade its course with
more conﬁdence. This move will
also put more emphasis on the
graduate level. ‘
‘Under the new program, stu-
dents will register in the Col-
lege for their ﬁrst two, years,‘
during which time they will
take a pre-business administra-
tion course. b
Early in the second semester of
their sophomore year, students
wishing to. major in business will
apply for admission to the, School

‘THE THUNDEIEKING MARCH,
or PROGRESS

S Today, as everygne knows, is the forty-sixth anni-
versary of the founding of Gransmire College for Women
which, as everyone knows, was the ﬁrst Progressive
Education college in the United States. —

Well do I recollect the tizzy in the academic world
when«Gransmire ﬁrst opened its portals! What a buzz
there was, what a brouhaha in faculty common rooms,

what a rattling of teacups, when Dr. Agnes Thudd Siga-D

foos, ﬁrst president of Gransmire, lifted her shaggy head

i and announced deﬁantly, “This here is no stuffy, old-
fashioned college. This here, by gum, is Progressive

Education. We will teach the student, not the course.
There will be no marks, no exams, no requirements. We
will break the iron mold of orthodoxy, hey.”

u

 

Well sir, forward-looking maidens all over the country V A

cast off their fetters and came rushing to New Hampshire
to enroll at Gransmire. Here they found freedom. They.
broadened their vistas. They lengthened their horizons.
They unstopped their bottled personalities. They roamed
the campus in togas, leading ocelots on leashes. ~

And, of course, they smoked Philip Morris. ‘ (I say
“of course.” Why do I say “of course”? I say’ “of course"
because it is a matter of course that anyone in search
.of freedom should naturally turn to Philip Morris,‘ for
Philip Morris is a natural smoke, with no ﬁlter to get;
in the way of its true tobacco taste.) ’ .

But all was not Philip Morris and ocelots. There was

“work and study too —- not in the ordinary sense, for there

were no formal classes. Instead ‘there was a broad
approach to enlarging each gir1’s potentials. ~

Tz?Ke:é 602256 car//ed  6

Take, for example, the course called B.M.S. (Basic

  

Motor Skills). B.M.S. was divided into L.D. (Lying =

Down), S.U. (Standing Up) and W.» (Walking). Once’
the student had mastered L.D. and S.U., she was taught

_ to W. -— but not just to W. any old way! No, sir! She

was taught to W. with poise, dignity, bearing! To incul-

cate a sense of balance in the girl, she began her exercises ,

by walking with a suitcase in each hand. (One girl, Mary
Ellen Dorgenicht, got so good at it that today she is bell

, captain at the Dink1er—Pla.za Hotel in Atlanta, Georgia.)

When the girls had walking under their belts, they
were allowed to dance. Again no formality was imposed.
They were simply told to ﬂing themselves about in any
way their impulses dictated, and believe you me, it was

, quite an impressive sight to see themgo bounding into

the woods with their togas ﬂying. (Several later joined E‘

the U. S. Forestry Service.)

There was also a. lot of. ﬁnger painting and gourd
rattling and sculpture with coat hangers and all like that,
and soon the fresh wind of Progressivism came whistling
out of Gransmire to blow the ancient dust of pedantry
off curricula everywhere, and today, thanks to the pic-
neers at Gransmire, we are all free, every man-jack of us.

If you are ever in New Hampshire, be sure to visit
the Gransmire campus. It is now a tannery.
©Max Shulman, 1957

And be sure to light a Philip Morris when you visit Gransmire,
or anywhere else for that matter, because Philip Morris is
always a naturally perfect companion and brings you this
column each week and is ignitable at either end.
