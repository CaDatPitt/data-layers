Fact-finding lesgislative hear-
ings were held in the Steven Fos-
ter Memorial Thursday and Fri-
day by the higher education sub-
committee ' of the State House
Committee on Education. Stu-
dents, faculty. and administrators
testified formally before the sub-
committee ‘in an effort to relate
University problems to the legis-
lators to help them formulate leg-
islation for 1970-71.

Rep. James J. A. Gallaher (D.-
Bucks County). chaired the sub-
committee proceedings of the 15
legislators. The hearings were the
fifth in a series held at various
state-related schools throughout
-the state.

The first da_v of the hearings
was devoted to testimony from
students.

Ten undergraduates and two
teaching fellows participated on
Thursday.

Joshua Chasan, a History De-
partment teaching fellow and pro-
minent campus activist. was first
to testify. Speaking on "Commun-
ications and Power" Chasan
charged the hearings were "an
empty. though well-intentioned
liberal gesture at practicing dem-
ocracy." However. he later stat-

ed that he felt the hearings did '

provide the opportunity for stu-
dents and legislators to non-vio-
lently confront each other.

Chasan stated he had no con-

‘crete recommendations for the

sub-committee. but added. "Edu-
cation has to be about life. and
people aren't learning about life
at the University."

Chasan concluded by inviting
the legislators to attend an infor-
mal get-together of students later
that evening at the Common Facil-
ities Building if they really wish-
ed to communicate with students.

John Seidman. another History
Department teaching fellow. tes-
tified next on change in the Uni-
versity and University financial
problems.

"Chaos on campus is inevitable
because the University is in the
process of democratizing.“ Seld-
man claimed. He also criticized

NOTICE TO STUDENT AID
RECIPIENTS

Students who have been
awarded financial assis-
tance for the winter term
should go to the Student Aid
Office. Room 325, Schenley
Hall. to pick up their aid pa-
pers between now and Dec.
21.

This applies to all stu-
dents on aid except those in

the states policy of "forcing men
like Chancellor Posvar and Vice-
Chancellor Montgomery to spend
a substantial portion of their time
begging for funds."

Raymond Seymour and Phil
Vaglica, both seniors, followed
with testimony defending the pre-
sence and crediting of ROTC on
campus.

Seymour pointed out three gen-
eral reasons for the reestablish-
ment of ROTC on a credit basis.
The first was "the need for liber-
ally educated officers in the arm-
ed forces.“ Seymour established
his second point that the students
want an accredited program by
stating. “On three different occa-
sions students have showed their
support of the ROTC program."
Finally. he showed that ROTC is
not deserving of the attacks it has
received that purport that the pro-
gram lacks academic merit. He
stated that there is room for dis-
cussion in the ROTC classroom.
that instructors must know and do
use teaching techniques. that the
standardized textbooks are only a
base and the instructors only use
them as such. that removal of in-
structors can be requested. and
that appointees to teaching posi-
tions in ROTC are subject to ad-
ministrative review. Under ques-
tioning by the committee. Sey-
mour gave the opinion that “ROTC
will die out within three years at
the University.“

tioned at length by the legislators.

Staff Writers

The Higher Education Sub-Com-
mittee Hearings continued in the
Steven Foster Memorial on Fri-
day. Morning discussion centered
on the Health Professions and the
CAS.

The first person to testify be-
fore the committee was Dan Mac-
er. assistant vice chancellor of the
Health Professions. He spoke on
the objectives of the Health Pro-
fession Schools and on their finan-
cial problems. Answering the com-
mittees more specific questions
were Dean Donald N. Medearis of
the Medical School and Dean Mar-

guerite J. Schaefer of the Nursing.

School

Next to testify was Dean Je-
rome Schneewind of CAS. Noting
that the legislature was consider-
ing using a credit-hour formula
based on a large student-teacher
ratio for determing appropria-
tions. he said that such a system
would dotimuch more harm than
good. As an alternative. he sug-
gested figuring out what it would
cost to have a one—to-one student-
teacher ratio for about 40 of the
students credits. and a one-to-50
ratio for the other credits. With
such a figure available. the Uni-
versity and the legislature could
meaningfully negotiate.

Schneewind also urged addition-
al funds for minority group stu-
dents, saying that many encount-
ered difficulties far beyond the
necessities of tuition, room and
board, and books. Many have trou-

Governor Raymond Shafer expressed in no un-
certain terms his disgust with the failure of citizens
to understand the present state financial crisis.
Speaking briefly with a Pitt News representative
before being hustled off to Chancellor Posvar‘s pre-
game reception Saturday. the Governor gave vent
to his feelings about the situation. '

“I am sick and tired of citizens standing up and
saying we should have more money for colleges and
penal institutions. and in the next breath damning
anyone who raises revenues to pay for these re-
quests." he said. "You may definitely quote me on
that." -

When asked about the effectiveness of student
petitions concerning action on PHEAA scholarship
funds that have thus far been withheld due to the leg-
islatures failure to pass a taxation program. Mr.
Shafer merely shrugged his shoulders.

“I wish students would understand that only the
legislature can provide appropriations. I can only
offer recommendations, which I did over ten months
ago when I introduced my personal income tax pro-
posal. It’s time for the legislature to act now.”

The Governor commented on the role of the leg-
islature may take in controlling University activ-
ities. He stre.<sed that the legislature has the re-

sponsibility to determine that appropriations are
properly utilized. but should exercise no political
control over internal University policies.

"The University is an entity in iteself and must
make its own decisions.“ he explained. However. he
admitted that the legislature could exercise its pero-
gative to cut financial aid if the University failed to
observe certain educational standards. which he
described as "minimal."

The Governor concluded by stating, “We are in-
terested in educating young men and women at the
University with minimum political interference.
Nothing should be done to harm the system of Uni-
versity self-government that now exists.”

Governor Shafer. who had come to the Universi-
ty to attend the Pitt-Penn State football game as the
guest of Chancellor Posvar. laughingly vowed to
maintain a "magnificent neutrality” when asked
which team he would be rooting for. *

and by the "absence of state plan-
ning for higher education.”

To ‘aid the University in plan- - I

ning its program, Montgomery of-
fered suggestions to the represen-
tatives. He asked that the state

congress establish a way of meas- L i~ "’
. uring a social need for products

of this University so that it may

produce people of those profes- V 

sions needed.

He requested that the state. let
the University know well in ad-
vance. at least six months before
the start of a term, the appropria-
tions it will grant.

“The cost squeeze in higher ed-
ucation willgetiworse while the
productivity goes down,” he em-
phasized. The University needs
better class size to raise that pro-

ductivity and more money to meet

the needs of disadvantaged stu-
dents without lowering it produc-
tivity. “We will let the taxpayer
know this is necessary for society.
Help us. as we will help you, to let
the taxpayer know.” I

Testifying on the housing situa-
tion of the University was John
Vrana, director of housing. Mem-
bers of the sub-committee ques-
tioned the feasibility of inspecting
off-campus housing for students
and setting up certain mandatory
guidelines for landlords if they de-
sired to be listed with the Univer-
sity. Vrana stated that the land-
lords wouldn't need to be listed
since the demand for off-campus
housing is so great.

._ BAS Chairman

Birt Wants Aid Alerted

by I. CALIENDO
Staff Writer

”"The Commonwealth Scholar-
ship and Loan Program is ade-
quate but there are many draw-
backs.” Cecil Birt of the Black
Action Society (BAS) opened his
testimony before the sub-commit-
tee on Thursday with this state-
ment.

He listed the first problem of
the black student as one of refer-
ence. “Most banks refer students
seeking loans to the financial in-
stitution with which their fathers
deal. Coming from a poverty level
family, the student has no prior
relationship with a financial insti-
tution. An added burden is the re-
luctance of banks to give these
loans because of the low interest
rate.”

"A major problem,” reports
Birt, “is that the contemporary
definition for financial need in-
cludes only room, board. tuition.
and sometimes books. This is not
enough for the disadvantaged stu-
dent.” He pointed out the need for
adequate clothing. Another ex-

A ample is the commuter who fails

to get a balanced meal becasue
his family cannot afford to buy the

food.

The BAS representative also
stated that there is no guaranteed

. __ aid because no money is available.

When questioned by the state
legislators. Rep. J. Gallagher ask-
ed him if the financial aid officer
offer was of any help with these-
problems? Birt replied, "Help is
limited. A student is told that a
national defense loan is not for
him but he is not told what is best
for his need.“

Rep. Fischer inquired if Birt
thought black students weren't
getting the full attention of the fi-
nancial officer of if they were be-
ing discriminated against. "I
wouldn't say that. but the help is
inadequate. The BAS is trying to
acquire more money and make
sure_students know the money is
available."

Birt stated that black students
are not only generally financially
deprived but also culturally de-
prived.

Birt suggested the SATs are

. not a good measure for admit-

tance to Pitt. L
“Should the standards be low-

ered for blacks?” questioned Rep.

Homer.

“I don't conceive lowering
them but altering them. The ver-
bal part of the college boards is
alien to the black community."

Is the IQ a better standard of
admittance? asked Rep. Homer.

.“No. tests are not geared for
people from the black commun-

ity. We must change the school
system. We ‘must provide a better
opportunity at the secondary and
elementary school level for pre-
‘paring blacks,” replied Birt.

The quality of education also
concerns the BAS chairman. "Ed-
ucation must be relevant to what
students want to do during their
lifetime.

The University can become rel-
evant to the student and the sur-
rounding community. People
scream about the money allocated
to the universities. The Universi-
ty should provide functional pro-
grams for the community. Two
intercurricular innovations have
made a start: 1) the self-design-
ed major. and 2) the black studies
program. Both are being hamper-
ed by lack of money."

When finally asked if cultural-
ly disadvantaged white students
should benefit from this program
also. Birt responded. “Toa cer-
tain extent. but I see the danger of
it becoming a totall_v white pro-
gram."

program as "adequate.“ but cri-

. ticized local banks for reluctance

to grant loans to many Black stu-
dents.

Queried by the sub-committee
as to the quality of University ed-
ucation, Birt stressed the need for
an expanded Black Studies pro-
gram. “That which is relevant‘ to
a white student is not always rele-
vant to a Black student,” Birt
said. He further testified that the
University co-operates with Black
students “as far as possible,” but
if often hampered by financial lim-
itations. .

The "Commuter Problems" was
presented to the sub-committee by
Ira Weiss and Victor Willem. sen-
iors and co-chairmen of the Com-
muter Association.

Willem and, Weiss placed major

emphasis on commuter parking
and transportation difficulties.
They stressed also the need for
more on—campus commuter facil-
ities. In a joint statement they
charged. "Both the University and

Parking Rates’ High

As Commuter Priority

The Commuter Students As-
sociation is busy working to solve
the commuter’s main problem —
integrating him totally into
the University community. One
of the commuter’s pressing prob-
lems is finding parking spaces
near the Cathedral of Learning
and close to classroom buildings.
Mr. Chenits Pettigrew, advisor
and director of the Commuter
Students Association, believes that .
because commuters are the major-
ity of the student body, they should
definitely have the opportunity
experience complete integration
in the University community.

The area immediately surround-
ing the Cathedral of Learning
is 2000 parking spaces short, but
there are three major parking
lots in the vicinity that contain
available parking spaces. The

Bates Street parking lot at the
intersection of South Bates and
Oakland Avenue has 150 avail-
able spaces. Another.150-space
lot operates on South Craig
Street. More parking is available
at Panther Hollow near the B &
0 Railroad.” All of these lots of-
fer low parking prices.

Anthony Miscamera, traffic
commissioner of the city of
Pittsburgh, has announced that the
city staff will re-survey its me-
ters to see if time limits can be
expanded. '

The Commuter Association
needs support to increase and
facilitate its organization.

. . ._ In order to com-
municate suggestions or ques-
tions, commuters can contact Mr.
Pettigrew in 1217 CL or at ext.

the Commonwealth have been de-
relict in their responses to the
needs and best education of the
commuter.“

The next student to testify was
Elizabeth Zicherman, president
of Panhellenic Association. Miss
Zicherman discussed the changed
role of the sorority on campus and
the need for more sorority hous-
mg.

Stressing individuality. she
said. "No longer can you think of
Greeks and picture any set of ster-
eotype." Miss Zicherman attri-
buted the new sorority image to
the "specialization“ of individuals
and the new emphasis on com-
munity projects. She was inform-
ed bythe sub-committee that the
state could not finance ‘sorority
housing unless student were
granted space on an "equal basis.“

Senior Diane Ulyon and sopho-
more Carl Van Horn testified on
"Unwelding Administrative,
Structure" when the hearings re-
convened later that eveing."

“Our frustration with admin-
istrative operation stems from
what is ultimately a poorly defin-
ed flow of power in decision mak-
ing for University policies,” they
said in a joint statement. The two '
expressed their concern to the leg-

islators that the state might take
over too much control of Univer-
sity policy. '

The legislators assured Miss
Ulyon and Mr. Van Horn that the
"University should govern itself."
but stated it did have the power to
influence curriculum changes
through appropriations if the need
should occur.

The last formal testimony was
presented by Michael Edelstein
of Relocating Student Organiza-
tion and Jo Dumbach of the Asso-
ciation of Women Students. Edel-
stein and Dumbach outlined the
problems faced by students forced
to live in apartments in the Oak-
land area due to lack of sufficient
University housing.

The shortage of available apart- '

ments, landlord exploitation of
students through excessive rents,
and deplorable living conditions
were the problems stressed. They
concluded by suggesting that leg-
islation be passed to control stu-
dent rents and to provide approv-
ed off-campus facilities.

The sub-committee then opened
the hearings for general partici-
pation. Students. faculty and ad-
ministrators both asked and an-
swered questions of the legisla-
tors concerning any problem they
wished to discuss.

In addition. he stated. "I don't
know if we have the authority to
set up minimal housing and safety
standards for students who are
over 21."

Also testifying Friday afternoon
was Richard Rose. who was there
in a double role: as director of the
regional campuses and as director
of ROTC. He explained that the
ROTC program provides the op-
portunity for a military career
and gives future officers the best
education.

He detailed the academic back-
ground of military professors,
stating that many have their mas- ‘
ter’s degrees and all have bache-
lor’s degrees. In the future, he
stated, there will be a greater de-
mand for military professors with
master’s degrees.

Several of the representatives
were distressed over the fact that
Roses statement that the FAS
removal of academic credit for
ROTC is a “detriment to enroll-

ment.“ but found some comfort in
Rose's additional statement that
there is now a faculty committee
established to "relate the ROTC
programs to the college in the
most effective way."

‘Dr. Lloyd Bell. assistant vice
chancellor of program develop-
ment and public affairs and direc-
tor of urban and community serv-
ices. testified on the "irrelevant
school system." He criticized a
system which "assumes that we
are a homogenous’culture" bas-
ed on the myth of the melting pot.
"It is time to recognize." he
claimed. "that America is not a
homogenous culture."

He asserted that the “produc-
tion line” approach to education

must be re-examined, and that ed-g

ucation must relate to the human
experience. “I don’t need to know
the chemical composition of water
to enjoy it as a human experi-
encef’ ’

 Page 4—THE PITT NE WS—Monday, November 24, 1969

by BRUCE BEAUMONT
Cadet P10 Staff, Army ROTC

/ Why join R.O.T.C.? It’s not mandatory, yet several hundred ca-
gdets still participate in the Army ROTC program here at Pitt, though
the elimination of credit by the College of Arts and Sciences has sev-
erely cut the freshman enrollment. This writer comes from a school
where credit is givenfor ROTC, and enrollment was required for the
I first year; but out of the one-thousand—plus frosh who are required to
I I enroll, about two hundred re-enroll as sophomores. About one hundred
 of these will last the full four years to graduate and be commission-
‘seed. a

Why? Patriotism? Perhaps, but patriotism is “out” these days, so
 » few admit it. Several sophomores in the ROTC program at Pitt were in-
 terviewed and asked why they re-enrolled in ROTC.

, “I’m going career.” This was the least popular answer. It takes
 a special kind of man to make the Army his career; evidently, few col-
: lege graduates are willing to spend their lives working for what are
usually below average wages (compared to the white collar and execu-
f tive’ jobs a college grad can usually expect) and hardships (separation
, . from their families, frequent relocation). Still, the lure of travel, ex-
 , citement, and adventure claims a few.

, 1 By far the most popular answer was “to get in and out of the ser-
2 vice!’ Perhaps the ROTC program has spawned a new kind of draft-
  dodger — one who would rather put in his time as an officer, a leader,
V“ rather than as an enlisted man. The idea has merit; after all, why spend
two or three years bowing to the whims of some hard-nosed sergeant
when you can have the more pleasant task (and position) of com-
‘ manding troups and using those four years of hard work you put in to
9 get that degree.

Credit for ROTC work is another touchy subject. It seems that
most critics argue that ROTC has little practical value for the noncar—
eer soldier. Perhaps so, for the dolt who has slept through his classes.
ROTC trains the college student to be a soldier, granted; but more im-
portantly, it trains him to be a leader. Leadership traits are vital to
get ahead in any business today, and most employers will admit that
_ r : those employees who have been good leaders in, the service show excel-

. lent qualities of drive and initiative in business.

I So the arguments against credit for ROTC are flimsy. It seems,
however, that those who have taken credit away from ROTC cannot be

. as ‘~‘-neutral” as they claim to be. If Military Science is voluntary, no

1 student is going to sign‘, up for acourse that he doesn't want or isn’t

interested in, even if it isworth credits. But take away the credits and

you‘ do ROTC a disservice, for- few are going to put up with work that

amounts to a three credit ‘academic course, but receive nothing in re-
turn-. No credit is not “neutral” — it is negative incentive.

at It seems,-then, that most sophomores jointed ROTC because they
‘wanted to; they feel they can get something out of it while at the
j same, time fulfilling their military obligation. All of them agreed that
_ROTC. is not mere “marching around.” but that it is an academic sub-
ject and should be given credit as such. Perhaps a serious dialogue with
theperson or persons in charge couldsee credit restoredfor all" for
ROTC at Pitt in the near future. ‘ V

Reﬂections From Africa

Special to the Pitt News
by PAUL STROLLER
Former Editor, Pitt News

(Ed. Note: Paul is now serv-
ing in the Peace Corps in Africa.)

I live without electricity in
Tera.

It’s a very simple thing to say —
living without electricity —— but
it has profound repercussions on
my life and my attitudes. It has
changed my environment. Even-
ings are different. Each night
at seven o’clock Yacuba lights the
Petromax lamp and we have a dim
night light. Yet, evenings do not
last very long. You can’t sit around
watching television; you can’t go .
the corner McDonalds restaurant;
you can’t even walk around ‘be-
cause 'of our friends the scor-
pions and cobras. And since most
people sack out around nine o’-
clock. (except when there’s a
dance on) there is no place to go.

These circumstances ‘keep me
inside the grounds of the C.E.G.
(secondary school) compound. Gen-

-erally I read by dim’ Petromax

light or I play "bules”—a French
game similar to bowling. All of
us— my French colleagues — go to

bed around 10:00 o’clock. because .

the hot Nigerian sun really drains
our energy.

This routine must sound boring
to a "vivant” American living in
the midst of so called “revolu-
tion.” However, my life‘ (per-
haps routine is a harsh word) is
not at all boring, ltis simple. By ‘
taking away the factor of elec-
tricity, I find myself outside the
influence of electronic circuitry.
Lightning quick news is a mem-
ory, more or less. I receive most
news two weeks after the fact.
And I don’t watch television com-
mericials; I don’t read newspap-
er advertisements (except in The
Pitt News) which I receive two
weeks late). All of these factors

W(titiltg

by BOB GING

help remove me from a mental
to a physical orientation of life.

Without electricity and with
the realities of living in Africa, I
simply don’t have time to wonder
about my identity crisis or as Paul
Goodman would say my "inte-
grity crisis.” I don’t have time to
worry about my virility, good 01‘
bad looks, worth or worthless
news, slavery or freedom. No I
only have time to live and make
sure that I will live without pain
or disease the next day.

You see, in the United States,
the land of health, people take
their bodies for granted. ’ When
water is taken from a tap in the
U.S. people think nothing of it. In
a restaurant, people drink water
without wondering whether or not
its healthy. People take showers
showing no concern whatsoever
to the relative safety of the water.
People in the U.S. eat foods with-
out thinking. After all most foods
must pass a test for sanitation
given by the Pure Food and Drug
Administration. At the dinner ta-
le; Americans smile and eat in
what seems to me an understand-
able ingnorant state of euphoria.

I can not share those luxurious
American habits. I do not have run-
ning’ water per se. My water is
either taken from some well or
the lake surrounding Tera. The
water is, to be sure, contaminated
byurine, crap, amoebas, baseli-
lary viruses, germs causing hepa-
titus, and other minor maladies.
Fortunately, I don’t have to worry
about Schistosomiasis. Most peo-
ple in the U.S. have probably
never heard of 7‘schisto.” It’s a
disease existing only in the tro-
pics. People become infected by
swimming in water infected by
snail larvae. Most water holes in
Africa carry "schisto.” Once in-
fected, a person can never be cur-
ed. Symptons like bloody urina-
tion, chronic stomach cramps, and
bladder and sphincter problems
can only be controlled; they can’t
be cured.)

Polluted water existing in a
small town with no filtration sys-
tem is unsafe to drink. First the
water must be filtered. After
that it musteither be boiledor
treated chemically with iodine
or chlorine. Then it is ready for
use. I treat my water chemi-
cally.

Water, however, is the first of
many living problems. All meat
consumed must be well cooked.
Most meats here are contaminated
by flies carrying all sorts of mal-
adies. Some of the meat has worms.
It is generally not safe to drink
milk or eat milk products. In

Nigeria, for example, most of the
cases of Tuberculosis are caused
by milk consumption.

Future life problems are caus-
ed by "les bestiales” (insects).
The mosquitoes here, for ex-
ample, are twice the size of mos-
quitoes in the U. S. And more im-
portantly, they are the chief car-
rying agent of many maladies.
First and foremost is malaria. I
probably have malaria right now.
However, it lies dorment in my
liver because I take a drug cal-
led Aralen once a week. If I
were to forget to take Aralen for
about two weeks, I probably
would suffer an attack of malaria
that could result in death. Malaria,
however, is caused by the mos-
quitoes that bite in the evenings.

The other mosquitoes, the ones’

who bite during the day carry a
series of viruses called filariasis.
When I was living in Naimey I
thought I had Bascillary Dysen—

tary — it may have been Filar- .

iasis. At any rate, I was bed rid-
den for three days with 102 tem-
perature,-aches and pains, and vio-
lent “runs.” Christ one day I went
to the bathroom 24 times.

I have to keep clean. It’s “so
very easy to become infected by
some organism. Cuts, for ex-

. ample, have to be cleaned meti-

culously. Even a scratch can cause
potential tetnis. In spite of our in-
noculations we must be aware of
here we are walking. Allsorts of
thorns and “cram,-crams” can be

the source of puncture wounds

that could cause tetanus.

A lastly but exceedingly im-
portant factor about living in Ni-
ger is the heat. In March, April
and May temperature can exceed
150 degrees in the sun. There-
fore it is necessary to drink about
4 “litres” of water a day. If‘I,
for example do not follow this
routine, I could become nautions,
experience violent “runs,” stop
sweating, become dyhydrated, and
die. f

So you see, with all these fac-
tors interjecting themselves into
my life, I just don’t have time
to be hung—up about the values of
my life. I’m too busy living in the
old sense of the word.

I suppose each one of us must
pay some sort of price for.our sit-
uation. The price I pay for my
constant and slow faced life is a
very physical existence. There-
fore I am not free; no one is. But
I have become quite used to most
of the physical realities of Africa.
But the adjustment takes time.

Wow! I could groove on a ham-
burger and milkshakel.

In Bureaucratic Lines

Staff Writer

Last year. the Office of the Registrar announ-
ced that it had adopted a new policy of register-
ing students for courses. By this new system. stu-
dents no longer had to wait for weeks to find out
that they were closed out of the courses they want-
ed. Last year, students still had to wait.

Thisyyear, the institutionalized bureaucracy has
adopted a new policy of “instant waiting.” While
the girls in the office talk to their boyfriends on
University phones, powder their noses, and run out
for lunch, the students wait in line for hours.

This is not only a problem in the registrars
office, but in the financial aid office as well. If a
student manages to drag one of the secretaries away
from her personal life long enough tohelp him, he
usually loses more money than he gains.

Today. when our tuition is going up every year.
and scholarship money is going down. it’s ironic.
how the bureaucracy at this University is so
amazingly inefficient. .

If one were to walk into any given office.‘ on

any given day. he would probably be referred to L

 

Mrs. Smith, a ninety year old veteran of bureau-
cratic technique, down in 313. Proceeding to 313,
the student would find that Mrs. Smith is in con-
ference, and is going to tea right after, but maybe
Miss Baker in 419 can help. At 419, the student
finds that Miss Baker isthe one Mrs.- Smith is in

conference with, and is sent back to the office’

where he originally started.

Getting back to the original office, the stu-
dent stands and waits as the secretaries looklat the
wedding pictures of one of their recent colleagues,,
finally getting disgusted and leaving.

It may seem humorous, but the bureaucracy at
this University is important, and shouldn't func-
tion asha‘ comedy routine. How many students re-
ceive incorrect invoices, due either to human error
or a mistake by the infallible computer? How
many students get their scholarships late, or lose
money because the people who should work these
things out are too busy goofing off? And’, fellow

students, as you stand in that long line, waiting 1
I to get closed’ out of your courses, ask yourself

once or twicexwhere the money to keep this leth-
argic bureaucracygoing is coming from, ~

  

Heartless Few
Laugh During
Serious Play

Editor. The Pitt News:

It it possible that there are peo-
ple in this world who laugh at
death‘? Is it possible that there are
people in thisworld who laugh at
war‘? Are there people who could
sit and watch a father send his 19-
year—old son off to war to be kill-
ed. and not be moved‘? Who could
watch that father. a grown man.
cry tears of frustration. anger.
and heartbreak—and laugh‘? —

A few people. and one young
gentleman in particular. laughed
at all of those things at Saturday
night‘s performance We Bombed
in New Haven. This young man
laughed out loud. at the wrong
time. in all the wrong places. For-
tunately. it didn't ruin the perfor-
mance. But the laughter upset the
actors with whom I talked.

It probably upset the actors for
the same reasoniit upset me. It
shattered the idealistic philosophy
I had that people are basically
good: that everyone has a heart.

Sure Henderson didn't really
die on stage; sure. We Bombed in
New Haven was only a play (what
an ironic statement that is. if
you‘ve seen the play): and there
wasn‘t really a war. But Hender-
son stands for the thousands of
young men who have been killed in
all the senseless wars that have
ever been fought. and particular-
ly the one were in now.

 

 

How Our Readers See It

 

If the young man who laughed
during the play couldn't see this.
he is either very insensitive or
very stupid. For the sake of my
idealistic philosophy. I hope the
latter holds true. But if it is the
former. I send his parents my
heartfelt condolences. Their son
isn't alive: he doesn‘t have a
heart.

Salper’s Letter

Nonsense! I .'

Editor. The Pitt News:

When a reader of The Pitt News
can become distressed at seeing
pictures of "female candidates
for Homecoming Queen.“ and
“seriously question the academn-
telledtual and social validity of
contests such as this." I am con-
cerned. To poke fun at. to attack
earnestly. or to disregard -Miss
Salper's letter (Nov. 7 edition of
The Pitt News) deserves some
thought. I

After taking two sentences to
state her inordinate feelings re-
garding the competition. she asks
a question of great apparent com-
plexity. If this question is genuine
in the sense that she wants an an-
swer. I will avail myself at her
convenience. If the question is a
vehicle for stating presumedly
true propositions. then attention

should be drawn (considering

Miss Salper's academic position)

to these propositions:

—l 1) The competition is a way of
selecting the prettiest of pretty
girls. ‘

—l2l There is a cultural pattern
of defining American women.
primarily in terms of physical
rather than intellectual attri-
butes.

-13) Given a class "American
women“ it is logically possible
to define the class. or for that
matter a particular individual
of the class. in terms of intellec-
tual attributes.

—(4l If 12) is true. it is a gravely
mistaken notion.

-15) If (1) and (2) are both true.
then (1) re—inforces (2 ).

I submit that each of these pro-
positions fall into at least one of
the following classes of proposi-
tions: (a) false. (bl unverified. or
(c) non verifiable.

The next sentence mentions that
Homecoming Queen competition
has a detrimental effect on the ed-
ucation of "both young women and
men. because it gives a prize to
the best object not to the best per-
son." Disregarding the dubious
conclusion and the more dubious
fact that the conclusion follows
from the premise. and the most
dubious fact that someone. some-
where coulddetermine how to find

 out if the conclusion followed from

the premise. I wish to draw atten-
tion to the premise. This I think

would make an excellent topic for
some industrious student writing
a term paper on perhaps "How
Language Can and Does Fail to
Communicate“ or "Should Lan-
guage Skills Be a Criterion for
Academic Promotion?"

In reference to Miss Salper‘s
last comment. I doubtiif the Uni-
versity does have a "policy" con-
cerning beauty contests. but if it
does it should not “reconsider" it
as Miss Salper suggests but rather
dispose of it and concentrate on
more substantial issues. With so
many other a-intellectual activ-
ities sanctioned by the Universi-
ty. the Homecoming Queen com-
petition should not be the first ac-
tivity discontinued even if it is
conclusively shown to have some
detrimental effect on our young
women and men.

Miss Salper’s letter merits no
more notice than drawing atten-
tion to its nonsense. I find it incre-
dible that such an ill-conceived let?
ter should be submitted for print
by an assistant dean and assistant
professor. What she actually had
in mind by writing her letter re-
mains a secret. but if she intend-
ed to discourgage emphasizing
feminine beuaty. or to suggest
that feminne beauty per se is not
a proper subject for popular judg-
ment. I hope she has failed to be
persuasive. If she wants to give a
prize to some "best person" I en-
dorse her elevated (? ) aspirations.

 In State-Relatedness

 Arnold Cites Distortion

Coordinating and planning last year’s House Education Communi-
cation hearings was “just part of the job” for Russ Arnold. Arnold. the
director of the Office of Commonwealth Relations. is the man primarily
responsible for keeping lines of communication open between Harris-

burg and the University.

"Both the University and the General Assembly have distorted
views of each other.” he said. "That makes my job more difficult. But.
"since Pitt became state-related in 1966, it’s vital to the University's in-
terests to maintain open channels with Harrisburg."

Yesterday’s hearings were designed to give the General Assembly
answers to what is really happening at the University. and to give the

F laherty
Analyses

Pitts Status

Hugh E. Flaherty. Governor

T Shafer’s secretary for Legislation

and Public Affairs, clairifed the
exact status of the University as a
"state-related” institution. Flah-
erty also claimed the University‘s
financial outlook for 1970 would be
grim if no taxation program is
passed by the State Legislature by
the end of this year.

I "Pitt, like Penn State and Tem-
ple, is state—related. not state-

I owned,” Flaherty said. "When a

school is state-owned it is wholly
financed and controlled by the
state. Many students fail to dis-
cern this basic difference."

The Governor’s secretary
stressed that the University is a
“quasi-public” institution. Con-
sequently, the University is joint-
ly controlled by both private and
state authority. But, inherent in
the state-relatedness status is the
legislature’s “appropriation pow-
er.” By failing to appropriate or
by cutting off University funds,
the Legislature can seriously ham-
per University operations. 4’

This year, for example. Flah-

L erty pointed out that the Gover-

nor asked for more money than

ever before for higher education

in Pennsylvania in an attempt to
provide all students with the best

possible educational opportunities.

However. since the legislature
has not acted upon the Governors

~ personal income tax proposal. nor

offeredany “viable alternative.“
Flaherty expressed grave concern
that next year the University may
be forced to raise tuition. cut

 down on services. or even close

its doors.

"The money to operate the Uni-
versity has to come from some-
where," he said. "and unless the

‘ legislature acts soon. it will have

to come from’ the students‘ own
pockets."

University community an oppor-
tunity to question what is really
happening in Harrisburg.

Stating that just meeting and
discussing problems is a step in
the right direction, Arnold ex-
pressed encouragement to the
University response to the hear-
ings.

"Hopefully. the University com-
munity will come to a better un-
derstanding of what the processes
really are in Harrisburg. and
that’s an important part of my job.
too." he said.

A former executive of the Bor-
elle Corporation. a Pittsburgh lab-
oratory supply company. Russ Ar-
nold joined the University staff in
March. 1969. He had previously

been active in alumni affairs and I

had headed the alumni portion of
the Engineering drive. -

Since joining the Office of Com-
monwealth Relations, Mr. Arnold
noted that he did not sense dissat-
isfaction with the University's
state-relatedness. ‘

The $950 subsidy state resident

students receive and the fact that’

one-third of the University's in-
come comes from the Common-
wealth were the prime reasons he
gave for the lack of real opposition
to the current set-up.

Since the General Assembly
holds the "purse strings" for ap-
propriations vital to the Universi-

ty operations. Russ Arnold stated ,

that his office has a sensitive and
important function to perform.

Langer Evaluates U.S.,

Japanese Relations

by DIANNE ULYON
Staff News Writer

Paul Langer is one of six RAND
Corporation experts who urged
the United States government to
make a unilateral withdrawal of
its troops from Vietnamwithin a
year. Langer and his associates
presented their stand in an Octo-
ber letter to The New York Times.

Last Friday. before the Univer-
sity Council on Asian Studies.
Langer discussed United States
relations with Japan.

From the United States’ pers-
pective it has seemed that “we
are doing a great deal and Japan
is doing little." But in recent
years the rise of Japanese eco-

nomic growth (third in the world I.
their rising importance in inter-
national affairs. and the evidence
of a new nationalism brought
Langer to ask the question. "What
will they do with this power?"

While the United States is grad-
ually phasing out its control in
Japan, Langer asked, “Do we
really want them to fill this gap?”
cautioning that “they may move
too fast.” ’

“I do not see them entering into

a wide-coalition to defend other ,

International Bazaar

Offered Exotic Gifts

Anyone looking for unusual or
exotic gifts certainly could have
found them at the International
Gift Bazaar held Thursday and
Friday. Nov. 20 and 21. from 11
a.m. to 6 p.m. _in the Pittstudent
Union Ballroom. Sponsored by the
YMCA and the YWCA the pro-
ceeds will be used for some of
the Y’s pet projects.

One was aware of a foreign at-
mosphere from the moment he
walked through the door. Vivid
colors dominated the tables heav-
ily laden with exotic items from
more than ten different countries
while Spanish and Grecian folk
music blared in the background.

Articles of clothing were di-

verse and beautiful: dresses and _,

shirtsfrom India. Mexico and Ja-
pan: figured ties from Indone-
sia: and ruanas. or wool panchos.
from Columbia. Leather hand

bags and arm bands came from
Argentina. Mexico and Spain.

Jewelry of all styles, shapes and
sizes was one of the more popular
items. An assortment of ivory,
turquoise, and tortoise shell
bracelets, earrings, and pins from
several nations, along with many
beaded items, were available.

In the way of novelty itemswere
Taiwan‘s famous hand-carved
Buddha's. ebony and light wood
figurines of Kenya's and Tanza-
nia's wild animals. and an assort-
ment of ash trays. Other big sell-
ers werethe incense and strobe
candles from India. The incense
came in sticks. cones. and cakes;
incense burners were also avail-
able.

With the wide variety of delight-
ful items to choose from. no one
could leave the bazaar empty-
handed.

Langer noted that particular in-
terest of the Japanese in the
Straits of Malacca which is im-
portant to their economic enter-
prises. There is a "great deal of
talk. but I don't see a Japanese
navy (developingi." '

“While they will venture forth,
they will rely on political and dip-
lomatic methods . . minimizing
military strategy in favor of eco-
nomic and political strategy.”

Langer does not foresee any
strong military policy until the
Japanese can test the Chinese and
Soviet Union's responses. In case
there is a failure of either of these
nations to respond. it is quite
"conceivable that there will be an
abrupt change in (Japanese! mil-
itary policy."

THANKSGIVING HOURS

:. Woodstock Captured On Screen 

Since last summer's Music and

Art Fair burst on an unsuspecting
nation. "Woodstock“ has passed
into the language of the current
college generation.

It has become both a password
and a symbol. It is also the mem-
ory of taking part in that incredi-
ble mass of music. surrounded by
400.000 of the friendliest. most
peace-loving people on the face of
the earth. A happy. joyous. music-
al. muddy weekend when the out-
side world though we were having
a disaster. and we knew that we

_ were having no such thing.

Now it has reached the screen.
Warner Bros. will soon be releas-
ing "Woodstock." a full-length col-
or feature film directed by Mich-
ael Wadleigh. a 25-year-old grad-
uate of Columbia Medical School
and NYU. and possibly the top-
ranking cinematographer to be
tuned in to the specialized wave-
length of today's rock music and
folk scenes.

Wadliegh is a far cry from the
usual product of the Hollywood as-
sembly line. A gaunt, intense char-
acter with straight, shoulder-
length flaxen hair and an invari-
able wardrobe of faded levis,~ bare
chest and ten-inch-high Navajo

. V hat, he has spent his days for the

last two months in a vast, Kafka-
esque working loft above a run-
down block off Broadway in New
York, surrounded by thousands of
feet of “Woodstock” footage.

The production office rarely had
to spell out the address - the
sounds could be heard five blocks
away — and the finished feature
film came together under the cri-
tical eye and enthusiastic encour-
agement of a constant stream of
visitors ranging from the who and
festival promoter Mike Lang to
Joe Cocker and Country Joe and

« the Fish.

Wadleighs associate and the
film’s producer is Bob Maurice. a
gangling CCNY graduate who is
undoubtedly the first producer in
major motion picture ranks with
an electric-shock hairdo that could
outshine Tiny Tim.

Together, Wadleigh and Maur-
ice put together the preparations,
equipment and immense under-
30 technical crew that covered the
Music and Art Fair. The achieve-
ment was not a minor one. By the
time the first long-haired children

   

of the love generation appeared on
the horizon above Bethe], N. Y.,
the “Woodstock” film crew were
already in place on the actual site,
Wadleigh supervising a team of
20 camermen and backed by a vir-
tual film-maker’s army that in-
cluded eight camera assistants,
six documentary sound men, 14
performance sound engineers and
synchronizations specialists, six
still men and 30 producation assis-
tants.

by ED CONLEY
Associate Sports Editor

Despite the Panthers poor
showing in the last quartergof
their 27-7 loss to Penn State
Saturday. Carl DePasqua' consi-
ders his first year as head coach
of the Jungle Cats a success.

“The big thing we wanted to es-
tablish was a style. a scheme of
football that would traditionally
represent the University of Pitts-
burgh and pay tribute to the
staff.“ he said after his gridders
had faltered. following nearly
three quarters of deadlock foot-
ball against the Lions.

"The future's impressive. We‘ll
continue to play the hard-nose
game. We're hoping to surprise
many teams.

The Panthers surprised a lot of
people in the game against the
Lions. Joe Paterno’s undefeated
gridders couldn’t move away from
the Cats until the final period.

With 59 seconds left in the third
stanza. Charlie Pittman put the
Lions in front. 14-7. by crashing
over right tackle for four yards
and a touchdown.

That big score materialized be-
cause of a 71-yard punt return by
Lion linebacker Dennis _Onkotz.
The versatile Onkotz won the
games Most Valuable Player
award for his efforts which in-
cluded two punt returns for 109
yards. one pass interception. and
eight defensive tackles.

“Denny’s that type of player,”
Paterno said. “You get into a
tough game like that, and he can
turn it around.”

Paterno seemed to know what
he was talking about. The Panther
offense had been‘ having its prob-
lems in the second half «for in-
stance. no first downs). but the
Cat defense—which had been stop-
ing many Lion drives—loosened
up slightly after the long return.

The weaking of the Panther de-
fense permitted two more scores
for the Lions in the final period.

Pittman ran 17 yards for an-

2 other TD, and Don Abbey romped

18 yards for the final six points.»

Paterno admitted after the
game that he feltthe Lions would
have a few problems getting the
nations tenth best rushing attack
underway.

"I think Pitt’s defense played
real well.” he said. "We expected

them to. We felt that our running
was our strength and that their
defense was strong against the
run.

“I'm just glad we were able to
throw the ball. If we wouldn’t have
we wouldn’t have been able to do

' anything.”

Chuck Burkhart. the Lion quar-
terback. was forced to go to the
air more often that he normally
does. but the signal caller who has
never lost a collegiate game was
equal to the task. ’

He completed 13 of 21 at-
tempts for 178 yards. and it was
his arm that gave the Lions im-
portant first downs in the first
half.

The biggest play for Penn State
in the first period was a pass in-
terference call that resulted in a
first down on the Panther 15-yard-
line. Two plays later Franco Har-
ris took a pitch-out from Burkhart
and scampered 24 yards for the
game’s first score.

In the second quarter John Stev-
ens recovered a Lydell Mitchell
fumble on the Jungle Cat 32-yard-
line for the Panthers. The offense
couldn't move the ball. though. and
Joe Spicko was forced to punt.

The Lions rushed ten men on
Spicko. They missed the ball. but
got too close to Spicko and a
"roughing the punter" penalty
gave the Panthers a first down
on the Lion 37-yard-line.

The Panthers picked up some
momentum and moved with rela-
tive ease on a couple of Jim Friedl

to George Medich passes and
some power smashes by Tony Es-
posito and Denny Ferris. Esposi-
to went over the goal from six
yards out to even the score.

Penn State threatened many
times before the Onkotz runback.
but the Panther defense held
ground when it counted.

The first half ended on one of
those impressive defensive

stands. The Panthers stopped a
Lion drive at the Jungle Cat sev-

game.

thers and his 23-yard field goal at-
temp was wide. But the Jungle

PN Photo by Koenig

Congratulations Cats!

THE PITT NEWS SPORTS congratulates head
football coach Carl DePasqua, his staff and the play-
ers for a job well done in the '69 season.

The 4-6 mark registered by the gridders is the
best since 1963 when the nationally ranked Panthers
were 9-1. The total of four wins is one more than the
number of victories over the past three seasons
combined.

Statistically, the gridders scored a total of 166
points this season, as compared to the total of 99
last year.

The 166 point total is the most for a Panther
team since 1965.

In opponent scoring, the Panthers gave up 287

points, the least since 1964. Although the 287 points_

given up is hardly an impressive figure, the bulk of
the total was amassed in the four lopsided losses:
UCLA, 42-8; Oklahoma, 37-8; West Virginia, 49-18;
and Notre Dame, 49-7.

This season also marked the first time since

1963 that the Panthers were not shut-out in a con-
test.

since Billy Reynolds in 1952. Esposito missed elips-
ing Re-ynold’s mark and thus becoming the leading
ground gainer since Marshall Goldberg by a mere
five yards.

Quarterback Jim Friedl set a season touchdown
pass mark, as he threw 12 scoring tosses. And sopho-
more wingback Steve Moyer narrowly missed a sea-
son receiving mark, as he fell shy of Skip Orszulak’s
total of 50. In addition to Moyer’s 48 catches, split
end George Medich caught 39, and Bill Pilconis had
19 receptions.

Ferris led the team in scoring with 42 points,
followed by Esposito with 36 points and Medich with
32. Ferris was also the second leading rusher with
459 yards.

With the 1970 season a mere ten months away.
it's also encouraging to note that a lot of -familiar
faces will be around again next fall. Offensively, the
top four leading ground gainers all return, along with
the top two scoring leaders.

ing sophomore first team all-America linebacker

All-American Richey  

' by JERRY MYERS
The annual National Collegiate Athletic Association cross
country championship are being run today at-Van Cortland Park
in New York City. Participating are a hundred colleges, includ-
ing a harrier contingent of Jerry Richey and Mark Vornhagen.

A field of -over 500 harriers have entered the mammoth
meet with Phi1adelphia’s Villa-nova University going in as the

_ favorite. The Wildcats became the

choice after their ‘relatively effort-
less victory in‘ the IC4A's last
week at Van Cortland. Villanova
scored 60 points last ‘week a full 78
points ahead of the second place

school. Harvard.

The best long-distancemen in
the country are running today. in-
cluding Mike Ryan of the Air
Force Academy. Art Dulong of
Holy Cross. Marty Liquori and

Donald Walsh of Villanova. Keith?
Colburn of Harvard. Byron Dyce

of New York University. Oscar
Moore. Jr. of S. Illinois. and Ker-
ry Pearce of the University of Tex-
as at El Paso. V

Ryan, last year’s NCAA cham-
pion, will be the favorite to de-
fend his crown. He is expected to
get stiff competition from Art Du-
long, who streaked past a heavy
field last Monday to win the IC4A’s
by a 100 yard margin over Villa-
nova’s Don Walsh. Dulong’s time
was 24:06.8. .

City. He is recovering from an ail-
ing leg and finished 30th inthe
IC4A‘s. Moore. Dyce and Pearce
are also former Olympians.

Richey will attempt to improve
on his sixth place finish of 1968.
Richey was officially acclaimed
as an All-American after last
year's meet and there‘s a good
chance he will do it again. His
fourth place finish at the IC4A’s

last week is a good indication of

his chances. Richey also finished
fourth in the IC4A’s‘ last year.

Richey will be running against

a former foe, Ryan, who he has‘

battled -both in the Olympic trials
and in the championship meet last
year. Ryan beat Richey by 36 sec-
onds in the 1968 race.

participated in another local meet
ton Saturday. Dave Cheseborough
finished sixth and newcomer Mike
Schurko finished second. Schurko

Soccermen Lose

Finale To PS U

by BILL NAAB

The soccermen were anxious to whip Penn State Saturday
afternoon and end the season with a winning record, but disap-

pointingly the booters fell, 3-2.

Had Coach Leo Bemis’ boys hung on for a victory against

the Nittany Lions, the booters would have achieved their first
winning season in four years. As it turned out, however, two di-

rect kicks in the contests final

four minutes in addition to a slip-l
pery playing surface cost the

squad their sixth win of the sea-

son. The booters 1969 record

stands concluded at 5-5-1.

_ "When the top layer of the field
thawed out. the footing became ex-
tremely slipperyrlt gave me the
shivers when the goalies went af-
ter the ball;— they could barely
stand up." Bemis said.

Despite the perilous playing
surface, one player performed as
though he were running on a tar-
tan track. Penn State’s Eric Al-
len happens to be a track man and
his speedy sprints consistently
baffled his counterparts. ~

"We were especially watchful
for him." Bemis acknowledged.
"He‘s dangerous on straight
break-throughs. It seemed every--
one had bad footing but him." A

"My theory is that he could run
so fast that he didn’t have to use
all his speed _and therefore could
run more sure—footed. The other
players had to run at full speed
and had trouble changing direc-
tions. Allen had little difficulty
outrunning our fullbac’ks.i"

As in other booter losses this

year, the soccermen controlled
most of the contest and suddenly
late in the game fell prey to a

quick tally or two. In all five boot-R

er losses one goal was the margin
of defeat.

The booters scored in the first
period when Trexler accepted a
pass from DiEmidio and then lin-

ed a low head shot into the net..' 

DiEmidio took a long second-per-
iod kick from Trexler and imme-
diately became involved in a
scramble in front of the Lion net.

However. he gained control of the‘

ball and ran it in past the goalie.
At the end of the half. the booters
led PSU 2-1.

Both teams played evenly in the
third period. All the "damage was

inflicted in the games last four §_ 

minutes when Kerry Krause.
hampered by poor footing under
the crossbar. dove in vain for Eric
Allen’s 20 yard direct kick.

Then. with only two minutes re-
maining. a Lion booter smack-ed a
35 yard kick which strayed wide
of the, goal. However. a penalty
was called and the Lions knocked
the winning goal into the far cor-
ner of the net.

Hoopsters Awaiting Rut

MIKE CALDWELL
Leading Scorer Last Season

by BILL NAAB
Staff Writer

Next Monday night Coach
Buzz Ridl’s basketball squad
visits Rutgers University and
the decisions upon which the
game hinges are as yet waver-
ing.

Ridl is still manipulating nine

' players. who have a chance of

starting. in his daily drills. He
probably will not point to a start-
ing five until the weekend preced-
ing the season‘s opener.

One thing is certain. though.—

Junior College All-American trans-
fer Cleveland Edwards will not be
available for action in the Rug-
gers battle. Edwards hasn't work-
ed out since he sprained his ankle
two weeks ago in practice.

Meanwhile, the other hoopsters
are little more than a scrabble of

names in contention for five start-
ing positions. The array of com-
petition for a spot on the big five is
distributed accordingly: two in-
side positions — Paul 0’Gorek,
Mike Patcher, and Jerry Causer.

Another inside spot—Mike Paul,
Mike Riggle, and Rob McFarland.
McFarland missed practice all
last week after he suffered an an-
kle injury.

Glancing at the quantity and
quality of athletes involved in the
battle for the ‘two guard positions.
one can't help but realize the dog-
ged competition. "We‘ve been al-
ternating guards from workout to
workout. They're all playing and
shooting well. Right now. (Bobl
Petrini. (Kentl Scott. (Mike)
Caldwell. (Billl Downes. and
(Steve) Lewis are all right in
there. Lewis and Downes have
good driving and dribbling ability
under pressure." stated Ridl.

gers Opener

Within the past week. the hoop-
sters have met localbpposition in
two scrimmages. Due to NCAA
regulations. however. Ridl is forc-
ed to clamp the publicity on either
preseason match-up.

If the roundball buffs are a bit
baffled by Panther personnel and
strategy, they are no doubt mysti-
fied by the Rutgers quintet. In-
side aces Bob Greacen (now in the
NBA) and Doug Birtell have grad-
uated, but Ridl has cautioned that
a 6’8” sophomore named Kaplan
may be a stimulating force in the
rival attack. Also, junior John Mc-
Fadden will return and add quick-
ness to the opposition’s offense.

In analyzing comparative
strength. Ridl mentioned. “Well
meet stronger physical teams than
Rutgers. We won't be outmatched
in size against Rutgers as we’ll be
when we meet some other
schools."
