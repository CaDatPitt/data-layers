Plan Passage

By JACK CRITCHFIELD
Director of Student Aid

In 1963-64, the University
of Pittsburgh, through na-
tional Defense Student
Loan Funds and through
its own resources loaned
$459,065 to 1033 students.
Many of those students’ re-
ceiving loans were unable

‘ to borrow the total amount

,./

needed and were forced to

reduce their credit load,

and/or to seek additional

aid from some other source. 4

Approximately 500 ad-.
ditional applications for
loan, assistance were re-
ceived from needy stu-
dents, who were denied
aid because of insuliicient
loan funds. ‘

Of the prospective fresh-
men admitted for the pres-
ent academic ‘year, 738 ap-
plied for ﬁnancial aid. It
was necessary to deny aid,
including loans, to 220 of
these students because of
insufficient lda n funds.
Loan assistance was neces-
sarily denied to an addi-
tional 250 upperclass, pro-
fessional, and graduate stu-
dents for the present tri-
mester. I

The University present-
ly has almost $550,000 per
year in available loan
funds. This ﬁgure in-.
cludes the loaning of an-
nual repayments from
students who have _'grad-
uated. ‘

To fully meet the re-
quests from needy qualiﬁed
students, already identiﬁed,
there is a present need for
one million dollars in-loan
funds or twice as much as
is now available. This esti-
mated ﬁgure does not in-
clude the undetermined ad-
ditional need for those able
high school students who do
not even _ consider college
enrollment because of no
financiallresources or pres»-

Both of the United States Senators from Pennsylvania
have come out enthusiastically in favor of the State

Higher Education Assistance Agency amendment to be"

voted on in next Tuesday’s election.

On October 17, Senators Joseph S. Clark, Democrat,
and Hugh D. Scott, Republican, issued a joint statement

,correcting‘ the “erroneous belief expressed by opponents

of the student loan amendment that the loans involve

outright grants, not in the public interest.”

Senator Scott underlined the fact that this "is a
loan program, not a giveaway plan, with provision
for student repayment following graduation. '

According to Clark, the passage of the amendment
will be “a vital step towards increasing the number of
college graduates so necessary for theeconomic improve-
ment and advancement of the Commonwealth.” , ’

The Pennsylvania Committee for Higher Educa-
tion Loan Plan, of which "the Senators are honorary
chairmen, has been conducting a campaign to inform
voters about the need for the loan program.

Both Senators stress the need for such a program if
the state is to be on an equal footing with the surround-
ing states of Ohio, New York, New Jersey and Virginia,
where loans plans are now in effect. ‘

ByLoanAmend1nent

0 November 5 Election Will Decide

011 Future Of ,_E.(lucation Agency

Appearing on the ballot in next Tuesday’s election
will be a proposed amendment to the Pennsylvania State

Constitution which would establish a State Higher Educa- .

tion Assistance Agency with the power to guarantee re-
payment of loans made to needy ‘and qualiﬁed students

‘through the banks and other private lending institutions.

The bill authorizing the formation of the Agency

passed the State Legislature unanimously on August 7,‘-

1963. In the House the vote was 197-0 and in the'Sena1e
50-0, and now the bill must be presented to the people
for their approval. V

The funds to operate the Agency have already been
appropriated and will not require thelevying of any new
taxes. The $500.00 authorized, it is hoped", will be sufﬁcient
to.generate as much as ﬁve million dollars in loans.

' - Three Qualiﬁcations '

To receive a loan under the new Amendment, :31.’-iv--‘

dentsmust be in good academic standing, Pe‘nnsylva1s‘E‘-‘i

residents, and have completed their ﬁrst year in college.’

 

‘ I_would like to address this letter to the students, their parents, and to the -
alumni of the University. The proposed student loans program to be voted .on on
November 5, is one that we all have a stake. in. We students and, our parents realize.
the urgent need for such a program. Yet we must insure success at the polls. On
November 5, it is up to the students who are eligible and their parents to approve

this loan proposal.

_ Here in Pennsylvania wehave noprogram for making loans available to col--
lege students. New York distributes 50 million dollars alone a year in scholarships.
This 1S not counting the state’s loan progragm, The lack of state support ‘to Students
has prevented a great number of students from attending college.

. 1“ Pe1m5)’1VaY1i'3 0111)’ 23 Percent of the graduating seniors on 1962 went
on to attend a college or university. The national average was over 50 per cent.
The problem appears even more acute when it is broken down further. Forty-
four per cent of the states: above average students have not gone to
college. Certainly this is a grave problem which the loan amendment will

/

make great strides in solving.

Naturally, before voting for such a proposal one should be certain what ‘it is
about and where it shall lead 'us. Students will be able to borrow up to $1000 a
year or up to $5,000 for their undergraduate and graduate’ education.

I ' Also, it should be remembered that the state appropriation for the loan proposal 1
IS only being used to back loans made by private institutions and banks.

As spokesmen for the student body, I urge all to support Amendment 1A. It is

a proposal that should have the full support of every parent and (goncemed in-
dividual in the state. The program would go along way to provide the funds needed’
to enable the thousands of Pennsylvania students who are presently unable to con-
itinue,-their‘. higher education to do so, It will also ope:n the door to the establish-. . j - sch

No Scholarships it
Although the amendment
authorizes the State to es-

ture, the “ present program
includes no clause which
would grant students

I   International Program

Called’ ‘Pioneer Step’

'\

/
‘

Last week’s International Week
program, co-sponsored by the Stu-
dent Union Board and the Inter-

national Student’s Committee, was
a “pioneer step in promoting in-
ternational awareness through an
exchange of ideas and culture,”
according to Bhasi Nayar, co-
chairman of the ISC.

Nayar pointed out that Mayor
Barr, The Pittsburgh Council for
International‘ Visitors, The United
Nations Association of Pittsburgh
and all administrative offices con-
cerned “cooperated fully to pro-
mote the success of the program.”
He stressed the fact that the pro-
gram was aimed not only at stu-
dents, but the people of Pittsburgh
in general.

University Initiated

He also noted that‘while the
University is taking the initiative
in the program, mainly because
the University has such a large
number of foreign students, the

«program has as one of its pur-

poses to unite the international in-
terests of students at all the area
universities_ and colleges, and to
arouse the interest of the general
public in this respect. .

He added that “this is very
important in view_ of the in-'
creasing role . of‘ the University
as a center of learning. to people
abroad. If the-tempo of the In-
ternational Week is , maintained
it will add to the. image of Pitt

j abroad.’; He noted that this pro-
gram has already taken an ac-
tive step in that direction.

According to Joan Gelfond, co-
chairman of the committee, one of
the problems faced during the first
attempt at the type of] program
was obtaining active participation
from students. “While the re-
sponse to the social aspects of the
program was wonderful, we were
disappointed in the amount of peo-
ple who turned out for its intel-
lectual endeavors.”

Forum Series

She was refering to the Forum
Series on the American Image-,
and others of similar nature, and

stated that this _program “was very
valuable because it In a k e s any

American listening aware of the
attitude abroad toward America.”

_ Co-chairman Nayer said that
the committee was very pleased
with the success of this initial step
in cultural exchange, and Miss
Gelfond pointed out that the Uni-
versity had alloted a budget to the
committee, which on the basis of
this year’s success might be in-
creased.

She added, “We hope to grow,
but we Aneedtmore active people.”
With. hespect to what type of
growth the committee aspired to,
Miss Gelfond said, “We need both
suggestions and_ people to carry
out the ideas. This is an opportu-
nity for interested students to take
an active part.” .

Crisis No.7: Comeback?

Dear Dick:

I am writing this letter "to you on behalf of »

the many newspaper columnists across the U. S.
A., who ‘long for your return to this country

after many months of assumed disappearance. We
have waited in vain for some
statement about your presiden-
tial aspirations in 1964, and ex-
cept for some mild (for you,
old boy!) reports about your
doings in Europe with the
Commies, the waiting period
seems to be continuing.

Now, Dick, we realize that
you have had a hard time of it.
Losing two elections in two
years is not pleasant for any— -
one, especially when you know
the voting was rigged in both cases.

Dick, we

know you’re a good American, even if the major- H

ity of Americans don’t think you are. Frankly,
there has been so much speculation about these
non-entities called Republican candidates, that
We felt you might need some urging to overcome
your r_eticen’ce.' ’ V '

Then, too, Dick, our life has been rather dull
without you. We miss your‘ wife, and your
daughters, and that dog of“yours, bless its little
heart. Harry Truman misses you, too — and even
General Eisenhower wishes you were back to
spend some weekends at Gettysburg. Really,
Dick, the time is right for you to make your move.

If you don’t run for the presidency soon, ,.

Herblock is going to start picking on somebody
new — like Barry. So let me tell you about the
offers which have been available to "you. First,
Lyndon Johnson is forming-—a night club act —

and wants you to co-star with him- Some patter, -

It wouldn’t require any real preparation. Second,
if you are interested in the Presidency, we have
been thinking -about possible running-mates for
you: "Margaret ‘Chase-Smith, General Bonner
F<?11€1‘S, Murray Chotner, Admiral Redford, George
Humphrey, Ezra Benson, and Roy Cohn are (all
available (hurry if you want Cohn).

We urge you to return to the “old Dick Nixon”
we knew and loved. A well-placed knee-lift al-
ways ‘disables the opponent, as we used to say in
California.‘ But Dick, there are some things we
think you Should change. First,’ much as we love
your darling wife, please have her change her
name. Everytime you said “we can’t stand pat”
in 1960, thirty thousand old biddies decided
against you as a wife-hater. Lord knows, we’ve
had enough trouble with that marriage bit this

1 year! ! .

Second, make a return visit to East Berlin by
next Spring ~ and this time have one of your
daughters pointing her ﬁnger in some Commie’s
nose —— just like her old man! !

Third, make your hints about incompetence in
the government stronger ‘and more" frequent.
Whatever you do, don’t offer any concrete sug-
gestions — just repeat “appeasement, appease-
ment!” .

Also, have some pictures taken ofyou playing

gtennis, or shopting, or climbing mountains. The_
_' K_enn€dYS_started this crazy physical ﬁtness stuff

and we have to use it, disgusting as it may be.
As a closing thought, you will be happy to
knowthat if you do decide to run, we will guar-

C In The Spotlight

toith Stan Schweigerd

   

%;.4-.,,_

the motion picture that offers

Sir Carol.Reed has discovered aformula in dealing with

something to the viewer, with

each new ﬁlm. The noted director—producer from England
has .had great success with the suspense ﬁlm as he demon-
strates in a simple and delightful style the manners of traps
into which human beings can fall. His latest production, “The

Running Man,” is a straightfor—°

_,,ward and breezy divertissement

that builds and builds, and
" achieves a sense of drama and
suspense that is highly entertain-

ing.

Laurence Harvey, Lee Remick,‘

and Alan Bates combine acting
forces under the directors skillful
hand and they are manipulated

- against each other. as the objects

of a chess game. This chess game

_ is very simple. “The Running
Man” deals with Harvey’s suppos-
ed death, the insurance that his
widow collects, and their attempt

to spend-the insurance
money, with Harvey
changing his identity
and .re—marrying the
grieving widow. It is

gets the money and flies to Spain’

to meet Mr.’ Harvey. Alan Bates
portrays an insurance investigator

twist of fate, which folds up the
chess board and throws the objects
into total confusion.

Getting back ‘to the directors

_ formula,  is apparentvthat given
an intriguing script to work from
ﬂipplus a handful of competent ac-
E tors, and adding certain deﬁnitive
_, touches that have been gathered to-
-.5 . gether from years of movie exper-
191109. ‘the result will be interesting

and worthwhile. This gives the di-
rector a chance to show his hand

to the other card players and Mr,
vReed’s hand is a full house. The

  

 

panorama of thespanish‘ country-‘

side, the pictures of small town
4' peasant life, and the sudden cli-
--fﬁamaxes, one after another, definite-

 

duct. Script performance, camera,
diafogue are all subordinates to
the work of the director.

The performers are quite good.
Laurence Harvey is playing a
_Britisher’for the ﬁrst time since
..his great work in “Room at the

ly make the ﬁlm a di_rector’s pro-“

Top” and the only thing that
could be said to that is amen. This
able British per-
former has been
cast as a south-
erner in “A Walk Harvey

on the Wild Side”

and “The Alamo.” He was a north-
erner in “Butterﬁeld 8” and “The
Manchurian Candidate.” In this
ﬁlm Harvey is re-nationalized as
an actor and the results are very
enjoyable. Lee Remick looks
beautiful in color and her acting
is adequate. I think it will be- a
long time coming before she _gets
a role such as the one she had in
“The Days of Wine and Roses.”
Alan Bates is new to the Amer-

Repairiaied

tion to the screen. I-Ive registers
solidly_ as an actor and his looks
are that of. an individual quite
apart from the Hollywood pretty-
boy image. _

However, in the long run, “The
Running Mari” is a director’s ﬁlm
and Carol Reed is at his best. An-
other part of his formula might
"be toinclude the word “man” in
-his titles. The man who gave us
“The Third Man,” “ThetMan Be-
tween,” and “Our Man in Havana”
has followed suit with “The Run-
ning tMan” and produced» an en-
joyable and suspenseful film that
is also interesting andfun for the
average ﬁlm-goer.

In Face of Criticism 

Beano Cook shrugs off

criticism the way Jimmy

Brown shakes off tacklers. Repeated blasts at Beano have
failed to get him down. Instead he comes bouncing back
with as much zest as the Cleveland fullback.

The latest barrage of abuse hurled at Beano is a

result of the play-by-play

Pitt look bad.

explained. “I called the
the way I saw it. And the

way I saw it, Navy outplayed Pitt.”
Wasn't a cheerleader
Beano continued, “People are

‘ always complaining about announ-
cers that are cheerleaders. Well I didn’t lead cheers. I

was impartial.

“If they want someone that’s going to. spend the
whole. game rapping the- officials or rooting for the
home team they better get someone else, because if
they ever ask me to do it again I’ll announce the

same way.”

/Beano is only living up to his old motto, “I don’t
care what you say about me, I can take it.” He doesn’t
mind being criticizedeven if he feels it was unjust.

Before anyone gets the wrong idea about Cook it had
' better be said that he is for Pitt 100' per cent, the im-

pression he left over the air

to the contrary. As he says,

“I root for Pitt '-with my heart, not with my mouth.”

. Denies Skrfemenf

Beano denies that he said, “It will be a miracle if
Pitt wins,” at the start of‘the fourth quarter. “I know I,

commented, “but I’m. pretty

what we’ve heard Beano

wasn’t too far wrong on

what he said. Navy badly outplayed. the Panthers

By AL BLUMKIN

Despite the disappointing loss to Navy last
iveek, there was one. facet of play by the
Panther gridders that was outstanding. The de-
fensive ends played their ﬁnest game in
recent years.

“They were terrific,” said end coach Ernie
EHeﬂ:'erle. “This was the best performance I’ve
seen since I’ve been here.”

The ends, particularly Al Grigaliunas, Joe
Kuzneski, and Gene Sobolewski, kept tremend-
 ous pressure on Roger
Staubach all game. The
Middie quarterback, a
Time Magazine cover
boy, lost 93 yards at-
tempting to pass and
was held to minus 33
yards rushing for the
,_ game. .
' Mindful of Panthers
There were times
,  when this pressure was
reminiscent of certain Panther quarterbacks who
spent the whole game looking at the sky in
recent years. “This was the best any team has
done against Staubach in a year and a half,”
said Hefferle. , .

Hefferle was high in his praise of Gene
Sobolewski. “He doesn’t play often,” said the
coach, “but he will be in there more after
that performance. There were moments when
I thought
Staubach permanently.”

The coaches held a light workout Monday in
-starting preparation for the game with the
powerful Syracuse Orangemen Saturday. The
players are still trying_ to shake off‘ the defeat
which stopped the four-game winning, streak‘
and which dropped. the Panthers to 12th in the
United Press International football rankings.
. Can’t Look Back

“We have no time to look back to last week,”
said head coach John 'Michelosen. “This "Syra-

SUCCESSES. -

The Orange’s most impressive performance
was this past week when they slaughtered at
good Oregon State club, 31-8. Walley Mahle,
their ﬁrst string quarterback, was hurt, but
substitute Rich King passed for two touch-
downs and displayed a Syracuse passing at-
tack which 'was barely noticeable in their
previous games.

Someplayers think the Panthers will come
back. .“I think we got all the mistakes out of
our system,” said safetyman Glenn Lehner.
“We’ll be ready for them.”

Won Last _Year

Last year, also on Homecoming Day, the
Panthers played their best game of the season
in humbling‘ the Orange, .24-6. Syracuse was
held to minus 11 yards rushing as the Panther
line put on a savage display of tackling. This

- year may be. diﬂerent. .“Last year they were all

inexperienced sophomores. I expect a rough
contest,” said Michelosen.

The squad is expected to be in good physi-
cal shape. Most of- the players are still shak-
ing off the bumps and bruises from the Navy
contest. Tackle Ernie Box‘-ghetti, nursing a.
sore leg',,was the only one who did not par-

ticipate in the workout Monday. He is ex- '

pected to be ready for the contest Saturday.

The gridders will spend the rest of the week ’

ironing out the ﬂaws which cropped up in the
Navy- game. A top performance will be neces-

'sary if the Panthers are to win “their fourth

consecutive Homecoming game.

‘Bailey Best Runner

By WAYNE HANSON '
Unbeaten by any of his
teammates so far thisseason,
John Bailey has established
himself as one of the best run-
ners in cross—country and long

distance track in recent years."
Cross country and track coach

runner we’ve had in cross-country
since 1958. He is very conscienti-
ous and a consistantly hard work-
er. He gets along well with the
'other members of the team and
becomes annoyed with ‘himself
when he_ performs’ poorly.
“However, he seldom runs poor-
ly. He is probably the most con-
sistent and dependable ‘runner
we’ve had in years and has one of
.the best records'for dual meet
competition.”

 

Loops Advance

High School Star

Bailey makes his home in Ken-
nett Square, Pa., where in high
school he established himself‘ as
one of the best distance runners
in the school’s history. While there
he earned ﬁve varsity letters,
three in track and two in cross-
country.

As a senior in high school
Bailey captained the cross-coun-
try team and was its leading
runner for the second consecu-
tive year. In track he ran a 4:29
mile to rank fourth in the state.

A junior majoring in English
and writing, Bailey plans to go on
for his masters and then to teach
in high school; In addition he feels
that he might like to coach track.
He added “I enjoy traveling, in-
tramural athletics, singing an
listening to folk music.” '

was the third best runner on the
squad, but because of his deter-
mination and pre—season practice
he has moved into the number one
position ahead of -the two men
that beat him last year.
Commenting on the team’s
3-3 record so far this season,
Bailey said, “The group in gen-
eral isn’t running up to poten-
tial. We have a good team and
should be doing much better.”
The arduous task of running
cross-country for the last eight
years has not dampened Bailey’s
enthu"'1sm for the sport. “I like
cross-country” he- said.- “It’s a
challenge to me more than any

 

thing else. The challenge is to try .
to get in front of every one else"

and stay there.”

As far as his teammates are con
cerned he has fully beaten the
challenge. .

Amendment (14) ‘

on November 5 ti:

To . achieve“ growth and, ‘development Pennsylvania‘ A
must forge a stronger link between youth and higher

education. But today there is a wide gap between

youth and opportunity for higher education in our ’

Commonwealth.

I Third largest state in population, Pennsylvania."

is outranked by 26 other states in the percent of
college-age population going. to college.

. I llalf the high school graduates in Pennsylvania
are college material, yet less than a third go to
cohege.

I Sixteen out of 100 capable» students do not go
to college because they lack _the funds.

It islclear that ..financial aid is needed to develop
Pennsylvania's most vital resource-—its youth.

Closing -T he Gap: It is almost impossible for a stu-
dent to “work his way through college” today. Costs
are higher and he must study harder. Yet we can
narrow the gap between the opportunity _for higher
education and our youth with a_ student repayment
loan program similar to those carried on in New York.
Ohio, New Jersey and other leading industrial states.
New taxes are not needed because this is an interest-
bearing loan plan, not a giveaway program.

Vote Forrstudent Loan Amendment: College oppor-A
tunities can be put within reach of thousands of»

“YES” vote this November for the student loan

Are More Loan Funds Needed? Despite various
private and Federal loan programs, a recent survey
of Pennsylvania colleges and ‘universities showed the
need for atleast $8,000,000 in additional loan funds.
Withoutgthis help one in four students will continue‘
to be turned away because of limited loan funds.

,How Much Will The Student Loan Program Help?
Quite a bit. Educators estimate that at least 12,000
students can benefit by loans averaging $600 the
first year the program starts. _

“How Will It Work? "Not a giveaway program, pas--' _
sage of the student loan amendment will enable 7.
Pennsylvania to set up a Higher Education Assistance

Agency. Such anagency has already been authorized
by unanimous vote of the State Legislature. The new
agency will guarantee repayment of loans made to

students by banks and other private lending insti-— .

tutions at uniform interest rates. '

To Qualify: N Astudent must (1) be a state residentf
(2) complete the first year at an approved institution
of higher education; (3) demonstrate the need for

‘financial aid; (4) maintain good academic standing.

How Much Can- Be Borrowed? Up to a $1,000 a
year, or a total of $5,000'beginning in the second
year of college and continuing throug_h two years of
graduate school. A ~

How’ Are. Loans Repaid? - Repayment begins six
months after graduation and must be completed with-
in five years’.

IT'S UP TO YOU: -You can HELP close the gap in
