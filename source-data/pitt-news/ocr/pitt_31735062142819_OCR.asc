WOMEN TO

TUNNEY DENIES DISLIKE FOR

CO-ED REPORTER

“Mr. Tunney, is .it true that you
don't like women?” - 1

“False! Absolutely erroneous,”
and the heavyweight champion of
the world blushed like a freshman
to a weekly co-ed reporter.

“What about our Pitt co-eds?”

“They’re just dandy. I like them
a. lot.”

But the mighty Gene added ner-
vously, “This is the nicest stadium
I’ve ever seen. You ought to turn
it over for a big boxing bout.” And
then he felt on safer ground.

“Which side are you for?”

“Non-committal.” Then with a
smile: “I was with’Pitt the ﬁrst
half and now I’m with Tech.”

_“And what do you think of the
game?”

“Well, Tech’s winning alright,
but Pitt's playing a good game.”

“What is your favorite sport?”

~“0utside of boxing? Football,"

He spoke in a ‘well modulated
voice. Fluently and_ forcefully he

  

 

he greeted officials and players and
thentossed the -coin. The Panthers
won the toss. During the ﬁrst half
he sat on the Pitt side. It was hard
to tell where most eyes were»focused,
on the game or on -Tunney. But at-
the end of the first half as the cham-
pion walked across the -ﬁeld to the
Tech section, every co-ed on each
side stood up and watched the cham-
pion until he disappeared from view.
Boy scouts crowded around to meet
him. And to have shaken the hand
that shook the hand of Gene Tunney '
was the proudboast of each of the
forty odd members of the Pitt Band
after Richard Skidmore, leader, ob-
tained the honor of being the first
of the band to greet the champion. -
Tunney smiled most of all be-
tween halves when eight clowns
from Tech, dressed in colorful cos-
tumes composed .of nightgowns,
vests and red trousers, and pink
georgette dresses, played a mock
football game in which they put over
some Nick Altrock stunts with great
success. The champion smiled
throughout the whole performance.

Problems of Cathedral

Students To Be Given’ An
-Opportunity To Solve '
' Doubtful Points

The problems of the Cathedral of
Learning-« will be open to settlement
from the ‘-suggestions of students
within ten days, according to anran-

Weber, supervising engineer of Pitt.-
-Weber said that as soon as the proper
forms were «printed, they would be
placed in boxes- -in the‘ offices of the
various deans, and‘ in stduent ac-
tivities’ rooms.- , - ,

The ﬁrst‘ problem to be placed be-,
fore the student body for suggestions
will be the question of the desired
type of dining" service to be offered
in the new building. Weber said that
it was a. problem to meet as to
whether cafeteria service, or regular
dining service, or “short-order” serv-
ice was what the students wanted.
Another difficulty to be settled, he
said‘, was the type and sizeof the
dining room or rooms in the-Cathe-
dral of Learning. All these problems
.and more will .be open to. student
criticism and aid within a short time,
Weber said. 5

Forming of Association Puts
All Schools On An
Equal Basis

LARGE POLL IS EXPECTED

The association movement reached
the college this morning, when the
only undergraduate _school on the
campus without one began balloting

 

 

‘ on class and association officers. A

ﬁeld of forty-six candidates ﬁlled the
ballots which are being cast today at
Room 107% Alumni hall. The larg-
est poll in the history of the school
is expected, according to Townsend
Friedman, chairman of elections.
Three of the offices to be ﬁlled are
_,without nominees, ,no- nominations
being. made for secretary and treas-
urer of the senior class or for secre-
tary of the -junior class. The’ Stu-

' dent Council . is to determine the

manner in which the vacant posi-

-tions will be ﬁlled, said Friedman.

Four other offices are each sought
by only one candidate.

Different colored ballots for each
class will have printed on each the
names of the candidates for the col-
lege association, nominees for the
athletic representative, and candi-
dates for the respective class offi-
ces.

Voters will enter the balloting
booth by the left door and leave by
the right. No one will be permitted
in the room except the individual
voters and the- election committee.
All campaigning and political stunts
will thus be barred from the polling
place, stated Friedman.

Nominees for Offices

All students of the college are en-
titled to vote for the candidates of
the association, athletic representa-

cers.

For the college association there
are two candidates for president, By-
ron A. Baur and Harold A. John-
ston; two for vice president, L. Rod-
man Block and Dane Critchﬁeld; two
for secretary, Catherine Fleming
and,Josepli Greenberger; and two

“Intellectual, scientiﬁc, and i- all
non-athletic activities hold a more
important place in City, College ac-
tivities than athletics,” _said -Dr. E.
Jockers, instructor of’ German ht

Pitt. Dr. Jockers, a _former instruct-
br of German at City College in New

 

York, City and in European schools, ‘

is also continuing his specialized
work in'thei ﬁeld of modern "German
‘l_i_terature.--  U ' " 1 . '
 In declining to givean opinionof
the student body at Pitt, its prob-
lems’ and relations with the faculty,
Di: Jockersstated that he has not
been here long enough ‘to g_et~.ac-
quaintedwith them. “I have seen
much good work done here,” he ad-
ded, “but I cannot yet Judge the
quality of your standard work.”
' Dr. Jockers, who obtained his
Ph. D. at the University of Straus-
burg in "Germany. has studied and
taught in many. European schools.
‘Dr. Jockers_ said that the -steel.
mills of ‘Pittsburgh thrilled him

‘ more than he had ever believed any-

thing could. Artistic buildings in
the Schenley district, and especially
the ﬁne collection of art in Carnegie
Institute -received his‘ praise.

}halff‘a century was connect.ed1__as -an

was a sister of Mrs; McCurdy. Mr.
Browne had two sons and two daugh-

were members of the Belleﬁeld Pres-

and the tract subsequently lay open.

Politics I _
With fall elections near-1y__ completed, there comes
to the ‘office the perennial run of comment bemcaning
 student "apathy toward ‘campus politics and political
’ oﬁices. Only 25 per cent of the voters ‘inthe school
of Business Administration visited the polls last week
‘ and-, with college selections in full swing today, three
ofﬁces to be ﬁlled are without _n'omi_necs. , _ ..  .  _
. The situation is not unusual; it is chronic.- It is,
directly traceable. to the indilferehce of the student
dared --at that conditions arelnot Worse; i " . l
The students can hardly-be blamed for their indif-._
ference. In the ﬁrst place, many of the oﬂices are, un-
important. Minor class oﬁicers, for example, have
little or no_duties,.anc_1 few honorsﬁ,-,jl‘he voter, wheth-
. er'he be busy or not," refuses"té§ke time"to-~b0ther
 with balloting on such petty matters... , " V '
, Then, too, college political »08l‘ecrS,, at the. .ibesl'-{last
such a short period is a ridiculous;' one in which to
formulate any deﬁnite policies,  out any__{.eﬁnite

j‘itin;1e;. Year in andvyear out new oﬁicers take the va-

that student interest, however. smallwcontinues, and

Think It om
Do students at Pitt think?
For; the moment, at least, we are not intensely V
‘interested as to whether they think about-‘what_ their
. instructors ‘say in -the classroom or what. their text-
" book says-. We take it for granted that they do;.
otherwise they could not continue their college career
for ‘any considerable length ‘of time. ' 
A I I. But do” students at Pitt ever reﬂect upon the mul-
titude of; questions relating to their lives as students
at a university, other than -those directly associated
, with their speciﬁc curricular va.ctivity;? Have“ they
 ever thought why they are. in college, why; theytake
"the courses "of study they do, why there arejsuch
’ things as extra-curricular activities, or why .an:'edu-
~i..cation? I ” T‘

that Judge decided to do it.

Not that Vanity Fair is entirely
worthless. _ _
Fair has brought some really great
ﬁgures before the’ eye of the Amer-
ican public. It has introduced Metro.-I

vic’s work to its readers. It was one -‘

of the ﬁrst‘ or'gans‘to recognize the

‘But’ Vanity Fair. has its faults,‘

too.~ It has made a typographical

darling of the Oakland‘ illuminati.‘ It
has published the. pictures of more
nonentities in its asinine ;»Hall of
Fame than one would think” existed.
Listen to it, and you might belieye

that George ..Gershwin:..is the great"

American composer. .

‘But its cheap fault is that it is
insincere- The shallowness of it is
too deep to be coveredby beautiful
typography, and pictures. It, has de-
luded thousands by its cheap, ﬂashy
culture. The things it usually es.-

I '1-ejad with ‘real interest the edi-

there was an overemphasis on the
responsibility of the organization. If
you will consult W;ebster’s Interna-
tional Dictionary (.U_nabrido:ed) un-
der “co-operation’?, you will ﬁnd that
to co-operate is to‘ act join_tly_ with
