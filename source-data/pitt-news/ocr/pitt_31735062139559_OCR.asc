Speedy Decision

On Cii‘y’s $20,000
Tax ‘Unnecessary’

Though a city tax of more than
$20,000 hangs over the Stadium, the
University does not have to hurry its
decision on whether. or not to battle
the tax, according to John Weber,
business manager.

“The decision may be made in two
weeks or it may remain under con-
sideration for a year and it half,” Mr.
Weber declared.

The ‘city taxed the Stadium after
declaring it was “unnecessary” to Uni-
versity life. The county announced it
was illegal to tax the Stadium because
it was "necessary.”

The board of trustees, meeting in
March, may consider the tax ﬁght at
that time, Mr. Weber said. In the.
meantime, the University stands on
record as intending to "ﬁght any tax
laid on the Stadium,” 21. statement
made recently by Charles F. C. Arens-
berg, University attorney -before a
county hearing.

Director In Conference

 

Frank VV. Shockley, director of the
University Extension , Division, and
president of the National University
Extension Association, will‘ be in
Washington, D. C. tomorrow to confer
with Dr. K. W. Studebaker, United
States Commissioner of Education,
and Dr. George F. Zook, director of
the American Council of Education in
the interests of the NUEA.

Ho-lgar Johnson Warns All Would-Be
Investors, Stresses Insurance Need

 

“The investment of money is proba-
bly the greatest specialty in Ameri-
can industry today.”

Thus did Holgar Johnson, C22,
speaking here at a meeting of the Pitt
Business Institute Monday afternoon,
warn all ‘N ould-be investors against in-
dulging in wild speculations when
they would be competing against corps
of men trained in_ observing business
trends. - -

Developing his topic, “Economic as-
pects of life insurance.” Mr. Johnson
explained the great part that insur-
ance plays in the retirement of the
“economically obsolescent” by taking
care of money management. “Life in-
surance,” he said, “is a cooperative
institution where the whole commu-
nity prepares for the time when one
of their number will meet misfortune.
More than 90 billion dollars worth of
life insurance is circulating in Amer-
ica today.”

The fact that the Government
might take over the business doesn’t
bother him, he said. He stated that
the life insurance business has been
operating on a code since 1906 and

that, “in plain English, this ‘is pc-.rhaps
the one thing that has kept it honest.”
But as for reducing the cost of opera-
tion, the government could “only cut
out the high-salaried executives and
p-ut in politicians.” He added that
state laws prohibit the existence of
cut-rate companies.

Mr. Johnson denied any faith in the
“Townsend schemes.” He spoke of
a personal pet theory which would
have everyone at the age of 65 retired
and would help solve a good deal of
unemployment.

However, Mr. Johnson was strong
in his belief that railroads would not
be replaced by trucks, boats; or air-
planes for a long time. He felt that
railroads would ultimately adjust
themselves to the things they were
best ﬁtted for.

The afternoon discussion meeting
was the last session of the Institute
open to all students in the School of
Business Administration. Membership
cards may be obtained from Wilson
Loos, C35, chairman, or from the of-
ﬁce of the dean of the School of Bus-
mess Administration.

however, the Mayor could not be
reached for information on what his
attitude on the City Manager plan
would be. _

Speaking last January before the
largest crowd ever to meet at an In-
quiry club forum, the Mayor enlarged
a discussion of “Temperance” to in-
clude an exposition of the single-tax
theory, and ably defended his position
against a barrage of student ques-
tions.-.-.-  _

Field Narrowed

The uncertainty surrounding
the future of Cap and Gown may

for the spring show.

The field of candidates has
been narrowed down from 16 to’
four, several Pitt alumni having
been eliminated from the com-
petition. ‘

Theodore W. Biddle, assistant
dean of men andvchairman of the
production committee of the
Graduate club, in a statement con-
cerning the appointment of a di-
rector, said:

“The Graduate club does not
feel that the selection of a direc-
tor is imperative at this time.
Several other applicants may peti-
tion for the position and we feel
that all applications merit a thor-
ough investigation. The club, how-
ever, would like to decide on a di-
rector at the earliest possible
date so that rehearsals can start.
We intend to lengthen the period
of preparation and rehearsal for
this year's show.”

The Daily Illini

NLY SUBCONSCIOFSLY and vagely does the average student

seem to realize that America is passing through a. revolution, a
revolution which is altering the lives of millions of individuals to-
day, and changing the lives of millions tomorrow. . . .

- Approach a student on the question of the New Deal, and the
following cliaracteristic reniark will be obtained. “I'm for it, I guess.
I was making $15 a week last summer and the NRA raised it to $18.”

There his thinking process seems to have ended. He might as
well take a correspondence course in etiquette as attend a university.
However, this typical answer is an evidence of a cer'tain attitude the
average student has on world aﬁairs. He is interested in the small
whirl of affairs which directly affect his temporary and petty inter-
ests. He has forgotten to read, to think, and to ponder.

Of course, the student is busily engaged with committees, coke
dates, and sororities and fraternities. He does not have the time to
investigate trivial aﬁairs such as our government.

Because it is the “thing to do,” most students read the headlines
of the daily newspaper. They feel obliged to be informed as to
whether the President is in Honolulu or Chicago, and whether hand-
some Tugwell has startled more lawyers with his ﬂuent vocabulary.

It has been said that. the student. lives in an artiﬁcial world, that
he is only pushing away outside affairs because he must all too soon
face them at the end of his college days. However, what is the pur-
pose of a college career if it is not a preparation for the world of to-
day? VVhether he likes it or not, recent governmental legislation
will become a vital concern in every student's life.

The Michigan Daily

Al’R.OPOS OF THE present eifort in certain quarters to purge the

schools of all that is “un-American,” the Indiana Daily Student
reports that it has uncovered evidence of a radical tendency in the
public school system of which Mr. Hearst may not be aware.

First grade pupils in Indiana. and possibly many other states, it
is claimed, are taught to salute the ﬂag with these highly question-
able words: “I pledge allegiance to the ﬂag of the United States of
America and to the republic for which it stands—onc nation, indivis-
ible, with liberty and justice for all.”

HANGES INEVITABLY occur in this brief or transient world.

Most of these we welcome greatly for they mean to us an evi-
dence of spiritual, intellectual. or material progress.

FURTITERMOR-E, what if there were a deﬁnite leftward swing

among college men? \Vit.h a substantial number of their recent
graduate brethren tramping the streets in pursuit of jobs that do not
exist, is it small wonder they pause to question a social and economic
-order that has left twelve millions without work and closed new ave-

311188 of employment? Villietlier capitalism can be patched up enough

to absorb all these (a.nd the 150,000 more young people whowill be
thrust forth in June and 1nan_v more Junes to come) or whether

America will have to pace in Mr.‘ ‘John Strachey’s‘ footsteps, is a

burning problem only to be solved by a courageous generation.

The sad truth of this whole matter is that until the actual pros-
‘pect of departing from his academic cradle looms dangerously near,
the undergraduate scarcely pauses to think of the Why ’s and VVhere-
fore ’s of the economic and political heap around him. If happily lib-
eral professors set themselves up as prophets to cry in the wilder-
ness, so much the better. After all, the Brain Trust has succeeded
rather well in VVashington so far!

“There the tragedy rears its gloomy head, Messrs. Swansong-
singers, is in the fact that all too few of these students allow them-
selves to be touched by new ideas. There is more reactionary horse-
power generated at one football game in an American college today
than in a. month of expert political science lectures. -

Still More

The man who cannot afford to get down oﬁ his perch and move
about among his fellows is wasting his time at a modern university.

All the wisdom and learning that he may accumulate will not save.

There are two kinds of students who brag about their grades,
those who make mostly A’s and those who come up with ﬂiinks.

It is necessary for the A student to describe how his high marks
were made in order to avoid misconception that he might be an apple
polisher. The ﬂunkers must tell how they were discriminated
against or else how little, after all, they really studied.

Strange as it seems, no one at the University will admit that he
or she is a triﬂe dumb. Those who ﬁnd themselves up to their ears
in ﬂun.ks usually carry it oﬁ with a sophisticated shrug iniplying—-
“Boy, do I get around.”—The Daily Kansan.

To the thinking student mind there must come a wry smile
when he reads of the travesty of $400,000 being oﬁered to the uni-
versity for an armory while competent, beloved members of the fac-
ulty are snatched from us. The cost of maintenance of such a barn
might well be saved for keeping the luminaries who are still with us.
Let us hope that the destiny of \Visconsin is something more than

The Satires Of Swift Still Hold

True In Modern World——Maurer

By Herrymon Maurer

HE VICTORIAN GENTLEMANI or the Victorian gentlewoman was built,

quite miraculously, without any organs, or any muscles, or any natural
processes. He had a. mouth, of course—-for the Victorians liked to eat and
drink, however much they refused to consider the results Of Such aCti0I1S—-
but in the public mind the mouth opened upon a. gunny-sack full of solid
cement. In short, the Vi-ctoijians had a great dislike for frankness, however
much they may have admired suggestiveness. But that. is another matter.

Pearlman Berates Lack Of Ecdysis
In Present, Past Peoples Of World

By Raymond R. Pearlman

FTER SEVERAL QED’s and GMC’s and NRA’s, Spinoza ﬁnally proves in
one of his theorems the noii-existence of an extra mundane deity. My
own theory, I admit, is not so recondite as his, but (thank God!) it, rather
illogically however, disproves the existence of an omnipotent and omniscient
creature. Simply stated, it is this: Had any God created man, he surely
would have had sufficient foresight to grant him a period of ecdysis as the

crustacea. and insects have. Q. E. D. There is no God.
But seriously speaking, it would bee

their reward. Unfortunately, whilei
we have not inherited their prejudices, 5,
we have inherited some of their con-it
clusions.

Of course the Victorian mind reject-
ed Henry Fielding as promptly as the
mind of our age receives him. The

.Victoi-iaiis disliked Fielding’s frank-

ness. his vitality, his realism. Where
They disliked,
also, the frankness of Dean Swift;
they disliked his truth, for it thrust
home too often. They dismissed him,
as they dismissed Fielding, by an-
nouncing that his character was
warped and that his writings were the

product of a diseased mind. Vlforse
than that, they libeled him by ex-
purgating Gulliver’s Travels into a
fairy story.
Modern Victorian Ideals

But we are little better than the

Victorians, for we, too, dismiss an
author who disturbs our prejudices,
although we act more subtly and
speak of the dismissal in terms of
psychology and truth. Instead of try
ing to understand the real character
of Dean Swift, instead of making the
obvious application of his tirades to
ourselves, we look upon his satire as
an exp-ression of a hat.e purely per-
sonal, a hate which proceeded from
the fact that he was disappointed and
revengeful. Having accepted this
idea, which ﬂourished in the 19th cen-
tury, we go the Victorians one better
and read Swift, happy in the thought
that we are equipped with suitable de-
tense mechanisms. Or, if we be with-
out hopes or illusions, we say, “there
is truth, but what of it?” But I am
not disillusioned, and I have hopes of
suggesting the applicability of Swift
to our own age.

To that purpose shall we examine
the classic form of the misrepresenta-
tion, ’l‘ha.ckeray’s essay on Swift. Be
it said in Thackeray’s favor that he
had a real, if distorted, appreciation
of 18th century writers, and that for
the following passage he should not

be sentenced to eternal damnation,’

but should suffer for only a. few years
the tortures of hell: His bitterness
(Swift's), his scorn, his rage, his sub-

. sequent. misa1ithr_0py~are ascribed by

some panegyrists to a deliberate con-.
viction of mankind’s unworthiness,
and a desire to amend them by casti-
gating . . what satirist meditating
an onslaught on society or an indi-
vidual, can’t give a pretext for his
Thackeray s1_1gge_sts
Swift's qualities are the resultof dis-'
appointment affecting a mean mind.

Swift And Vanity

He came closer to a true evaluation
of the 18th century individual in his
characterization of Beatrix in Henry
Esmond. Beatrix is the lady who tries
desperately to be successful material-
13’. and S0Cia11Y. who realizes ' the
foolishness. the silliness, the cowardli-
ness of her own nature. yet who can
do nothing about it. This is not only
Beatrix, it is a large-sized part of high
society in the 18th century. It is
Jonathan Swift, who recognized vanity
and ambition when he saw it, who
could not change but could only mock.
Thackeray might have seen Swift in
this light had Swift not been so
pointed, in a word, not so effective a
Satirist. But, to his eternal credit,
Swift spared neither himself .nor any-
one else. Satire is satire, and ~the
18th century is the 18th century. The
two don't mix.

Besides, one of the basic prejudices
of the 19th century-—ai1d of the 20tli—
gave him support. Thackeray looked
upon people from an individualized
point of view. Small part of a per-
son's nature depended, according to
this theory, upon the nature of the
age in which that person lived. Peo-
ple were to be explained in terms of
their own natures acting in the abso-
lute. A measure of truth there is, no
doubt, in this theory if it be applied
to the comparatively stable and well-
functioning Victorian age. It becomes
misleading when applied wholesale to

other time of decay and change.

But, say you, what. support do you
have for your theory that Swift ex-
presses his age and differs from his
contemporaries only in keenness and
penetration? The word betrays the
man. It is not difficult to see the self-
seeking politician in the Short Char-
acter of Lord Wharton. The Tory
propaganda. in The Conduct of the
Allies stands apart from passages on
the folly of war and the desirability
of peace. But it is strange—perhap~s
not so strangewthat anyone .. should
make of Gu|liver’s Travels or A Mod-
est Proposal anything but a forceful
diagnosis by an expert who spared no
one, not even himself. But it has
been done. Thackeray among others
did it.

Thackera.y’s Bogey Man

He disposes of .a Modest Proposal

by refusing to understand Swift's
method of satire. Swift, when he
used this method, described cold-

bloodedly and carefully, all the while
concealing outraged feelings by a cool
front, some extravagant. and prepos-
terous scheme; then, by a few deft
strokes, he would suggest the siini-
larity of this revolting plan to the
actuality of themoment; he would go
farther and show that even this awful
method——-in this ‘case. _.the . eating of
children of the poor when they were
a year old———was more humane than
their real treatment. But no, Thack-
eray did not see. the obvious; he pre-
ferred to accept the Modest Proposal
not as a satire. but as the diabolical
suggestion of a mean old man. Swift,
he says, “rages against children . . .
Could Steele, or Goldsmith, or Field-
ing, in his most reckless moment of
satire, have written anything like the
Dean's famous ‘Modest Proposal’ for
eating children? No one of these but
nielts at the thoughts of childhood,
fondles and caresses it. Mr. Dean has
no such softness, and enters the nur-
sery with the tread and gaiety of an
ogre.” ‘ ' _
Wliereupon' Mr. Thackeray——truly
the only satire of the Victorians was
directed against s_al;ire—~descends upon
G€||llVeI"5 Travels with phrases such
as these: “As for the humor and con-
ductof this famous fable, I suppose
there is no person who reads but
must admire; as for the moral, I
think it horrible, shameful, unnianly,
blasphemous; and giant and great as
this Dean is, I say we should hoot
hi'in._” So here we are. An author
may write something that is “horrible,
shameful, unmanly, blasphemous,”
but yet we must admire “the humour
and conduct.” We are to admire, per-
h'a.'1)s, the »sk'illfu'l ‘handling of a razor
by a man who can kill no fewer than

» ten adults and 20 children!

ijAI_1d in speaking of the last part of
Gulliver's Travels, A Voyage to the

.Hfouyhn_hnms, Mr. Critic says that it is

like the hero hiinself: “A monster

gibbering shrieks, and gnashing im-

.pr.ecal;ions against mankind———tearing
down all shreds ofmodesty, past all

sense of manliness and shame; ﬁlthy.

in word, ﬁlthy in thought, furious,
raﬁging, obscene.”_ Dear Mr. Critic,
think not of hooting M1‘. Dean before
you stuff cotton- in your own ears.

‘Enough of the Victorian age. In
many ways, heaven knows, it sur-
passed ours. Leave out the quarrel
wiith obscenity and you have the mod-
erfn complaint against Swift. Any
se_lf—coniplacent age will go to any

the analogy too far—-if we humans
could cast off our old ideas and preju-
dicial notions. Most men as they ad-
vance in years become obsolete and
incapable of keeping up with the in-
tellectual world. Thus it is with great
artists who in their closing days be-
come effete and who continue to hold
the same views they held 20 years be-
fore. ‘ They become like preachers
who continue to preach» at 70 what-
they were instructed to teach at 20.
Ah, for an intellectual rejuvenescence!
Wadsworth and Twain would have
given their right arms for it. Neither

realized he was “through” 20 years
before his last work.

The End Of Wells

VVe ﬁnd a good example of this in
H. G. Wells, who has recently at the
age of 69—and who is 69 intellectual-
l_v——published his Experiment in Auto-
biography. Perhaps \Vells does real-
ize he is through. For he named the
book Experiment in Autobiography,
and what an experiment it is! It
marks the complete extinction of a
once imaginative and proliﬁc writer.
The verve of H. G. Wells has been
early
method of thinking. That is the trou-
ble with Wells. He is still living in
the 1920's, 15 years behind his time.
His kind of writing and thinking is
well—nigl-. altinodisch. We need only
turn to his chapter of “The idea of a
planned world.” The seer Mr. Vvells
writes: “It has been the refrain of
my lifetime that Marx, antagonized
Property and the expropriated too
crudely, and that he confused mere
limitation and unhappiness with the
rarer and more precious motive of
creative discontent . . He looked,
therefore, to the indignant proletariat
evolved by his own imagination as the
sole driving force of his revolution,
and he stamped the theory of the
Class War upon human affairs with
immense and fatal determination.”

Now the truth "of the matter is that
Mr. W’ells has not yet caught up to
Marx. lHe is still thinking in terms
of the “rugged individualism” of the
“twenties." He made a complete mess
of the Fabian society, the pseudo-Lib-
eral Verein of the last half of the 19th
century.

In all of Mr. Wells’ works he has
failed to think in terms of social
categories. In Ann Veronica he in-
terpreted society through this revolt-
ing maiden, instead of ‘understanding
her in termsi of the so_c_ial set-up. He
-has, furthermore. never been "very
much concerned with the lower
stratum of his people. The mining
towns, the factory workers, the slaves
of England, he has never given serious
thought. He has been content to en-
visage fantastic, meaningless Utop-ias.

The Fecundity Of A Man

Few writers have been so proliﬁc as
Wells. (An entire card box at Carne-
gie Library is needed for his works).
Yet despite his fecundity he has al-
ways, and especially recently, seemed
to me a. devitalized writer. Preoccu—
pied with the development of his own
native ability, he has lived a rather
selﬁsh life. There seems to me to be
something more vital for an artist
than the creation of utopian worlds,——
something more vital than the gloriﬁ-
cation of one's ego, something more
vital than giving expression to one's
every thought, merely for the sake of
expression. How can a man even at-
tempt to call himself a great artist
when he is content to sit around and
cater to eternal daydreams! Especially
when the world ﬁnds itself in such a
plight as today. I suggest to you, Mr.
VVells, that you should, like your fel-

low individualistic writers, cease

Cagers Meet Undefeated

Titans In Stadium Tonight.

 

Two Athletic Events Scheduled For Saturday Evening;

Matmen, Basketeers

Oppose Mountaineers

 

1t‘s examination time up at

\Vest.niinster college in New \Vil-

z{iiiigtoi1' today, but ‘it isn’t the exams which are uppermost in the
minds of the \Vest.iiiinster collegians. F or there: is not a single stu-
dent in the whole school who would not trade an “A” in Psych or a
passing mark in English for a. basketball victory over the Panthers

at the stadium toniglit.
Ever since last year when the

Panthers chopped out a 32-26 vic-

tory over the Titans here at the sta-9

dium,all citizens north of New Castle
have been awaiting the time when the
\Vestininster men would get another
try. _Tll€» chance comes as the Titans
are riding on the crest of a nine-ganie
victory streak and percliing right up
at the top or‘ the district ﬂoor stand-
ings.

Four of the ﬁve cagers who took the
floor against Pitt last year may be
called upon by Coach Johnny Lawther
tostart the ball game tonight. Law-
thcr can rest, assured that these boys
will be out for revenge and it is very
likely that they didn't pace the ﬂoor
until 4 o'clock this morning, as it is
reported they did last year.

‘Wes Bennett, the district's leading
scorer, will be here again, anxious to
continue the scoring activities which
have brought him a 15-point ii game
average this season. Ray Sweeney,
the diminutive forward who caused
Pitt followers several periods of heart-
failure with successful long shots last
year, will be here again. So will
Swede Huiineke, the man who played
a great game at guard that night, and
his mate at the guard’ posts, Wilhelni.
Pete Leyshock, the other member of
last year's first team, has been de-
clared ineligible and his place in the
lineup will be taken by Backus. Back-
us will likely appear a.t the center
position, sending Bennett to forward.

The Panthers Will Be There ’

All that the Titans have to ﬁgure
on, however, is that Dr. Carlson and
his basketeers are ready and waiting
for that ball game, too. The Pan-
thers appear to have hit their true
stride and are anxious to clear up- any
little ideas people may have that they
aren’t quite the ball club they were
last year.

The regular Pitt ﬁve will be ready
to start and with all indications point-
ing to a hot game, the Cats can be
counted upon to shoot the works". If
they Clo, there may be a lot of sorrow-
ful students up in New Vvilmington,
toniorrow. And it won't be the ex-
ams. either.

In the preliminary to the varsity
game, the Pitt freshmen will tangle
with Dormont high. The freshmen
appear to be going places ever since
their loss to the Duke Plebes and
should make it hot for the Boro boys.
The game starts at 7:15.

The probable starting lineup:

Pitt -Pos. Westminster
Hughes  Bennett
Cribbs..  ‘Sweeney
Noon Backus
Emrick  Hunneke
Roderick  ‘Wilhelm

Time of Game: 8:15 o'clock.

Meet Mountaineers Saturday

Another strong quintet comes to
battle the Panthers this week when
the West Virginia team meets the Pitt
ﬁve Saturday night on the Stadium
ﬂoor. Coach “Sleepy” Glenn leads his
proteges against Pitt with only one
black mark on the Mountaineers’
slate to date, that being a defeat by
Duquesne last week at Morgantown.

After the basketball teams ﬁnish
their battle, the stadium ground crew
will unroll the wrestling mats on the
pavilion ﬂoor and the wrestling teams
of the two schools will settle another
little argument on the mats. The
matches will mark the opening of the
wrestling season for both teams.

Captain Art Detzel, who has been
suffering from inﬂuenza for some
time, will be lost for the opener, and
in his absence, Norman Evans, a 125-
pound_er, will take the role of acting
captain.

In the 118-pound class will be Ber-
ziard Babcock, while the 135-pound
will ﬁnd either William Cover or
Lloyd Conley starting. Russell Bedil-
lion is the most likely candidate at
the 145-pound class, Richard George
is Oster’s choice for the 155-pound
event, and Arthur Willets is the prob-
able starter in the 165-pound match.
Two members of the football squad
will take care of the 175-pound divi-
sion and the heavyweight class, Earl
McC-ue in the former match and
Leonard Rector‘ in the latter.

 

Panther Runners A
In Buffalo Meet

Kiger, Kirkpatrick Enter Junior
Indoor Championship Races

 

 

Two Pitt track stars will be seen in
action at the National Junior Indoor
track and ﬁeld championships held in
Buffalo, New York this week end.

Fred Kiger, speedy quarter-miler
for the Panthers, will enter his spe-
cialty, the 400 meter event, and
Cli-arles'Kirkpatrick, outstanding dis-
tance runner for the Blue and Gold
will attempt to add further laurels in
the 1,500 meter run.

Both Kiger and Kirkpatrick will
face the stiffest sort of opposition run-
ning against some of the outstanding
runners of the east and mid-west.

Aside from the activities of these
two men, the practice drills will be
lightened a bit until after exam week.
However, Coach Olson will probably
send a mile—relay team to the Melrose
Athletic club meet in New York on
February 2. At the present time, it
looks as though the team of Kiger,
(Jonnelly, McDonald, and Groat will
comprise the outﬁt to be sent.

After the Gotham meet, the indoor
season will be officially opened, as far
as the team is concerned, with the tri-
angular meet at Morgantown, \Vest
Virginia on February 9 with the Moun-
taineers and Nittany Lions forming
the opposition for the Panther track-
men,

Bob Madden, Frank Broida
Advance In Net Tourney

Bob Madden, University tennis
champion, and his doubles partner,
Frank Broida, Pitt law school student,‘
continued their advance in the Pitts-
burgh Golf club tennis tournament,
