 

City budget to cut Oakland fire truck

By David T. Welch

and Megan Bertino
T be Pitt News

The mayor's planned budget
Cuts will remove the ﬁre engine
which responds to 80 percent of
the calls from Pitt’s campus,
Captain of Fire House 14 Bryan
Devine said.

Pumper engine number 14,
which carries water and hoses,
will be removed from South
Oakland, leaving only a ladder
truck in the ﬁre station on the
cornerof McKee Place and Louisa
Street.

Responses to fires in South
Oakland would come from House
10 on Allequippa Street and
House 11 in Shadyside, with
backup coming from companies
in Greenfield and Duquesne,
according to City Fire Chief
Charles Dickinson.

Dickinson said the response
time to ﬁres will not be affected,
but Devine said the responses
would depend on the time of day
and weather conditions.

“It’s the initial one or two
minutes that make a gigantic
difference,” Devine said.

According to Glenn Cannon,
city public safety director, a
pumper can still be at a ﬁre in
South Oakland within the
maximum five—minute response
time. ' »

This response time is achieved
72 percent of the time throughout
the city, according to Cannon.
Cannon claimed that under the
reorganization a pumper will
arrive at a fire within five minutes
92 percent of the time.

Essentially, removing the
pumper truck has shut down the
South Oakland ﬁre house, Devine
said. Keeping it open without the

pumper is “a facade to appease
the public. The majority of people
will see [the ladder truck] in the
garage and be satisﬁed.

“If I were a Pitt student, _ I
wouldn't live in lower Oakland,”
Devine said. . 4

, The reorganization comes after
a recent study commissioned by
Mayor Sophie Masloff to
determine where cuts in the ﬁre
department could be made.

The initial results advised that
the city shut down eight ﬁre
houses in the 55—mile district, but
the city has decided to close only
one ﬁre house and redistribute
vehicles and fire fighters.

According to Cannon, 16 fire
fighters must respond — to 1 each

alarm. Currently, there are three‘

people per truck. Under the

reorganization, there will be four

fire fighters per truck so there

Report of Pitt police
numbers inaccurate

By Lisa Raff and

Catherine Goldstein
The Pitt News

At last week’s Student Government Board meeting, Director
of Public Safety William Brennan said the university employs
about 100 police officers and security guards combined. But
according to a roster of commissioned personnel of the
department, there are actually 45 patrolling ofﬁcers and 16
security guards. A .

Brennan’s 100—person estimate represents ﬁve administrative
personnel, 13 supervisors, 16 security guards, two dispatchers,
three part—time guards, two detectives and 4S_ campus police
ofﬁcers. - v ,
_ These numbers add up to 84. Brennan said he only included
uniformed officers in his previous count of 100, but police
ofﬁcer Karen McKee-Jones said she was surprised at the large
number and asked Brennan if his calculation was accurate.

McKee-Jones said Brennan told her the number also included
desk attendants who work in the various Pitt dormitories.

“I included only uniformed officers in my count. The ﬁgure
of 100 does not include desk attendants,” Brennan said.

Desk attendants for the Litchﬁeld Towers, Forbes Hall and
Lothrop Hall areemployed by K and S Security Incorporated
and are not supervised by public safety, according to JoAnn
Woodson, director of the Office of Residence Life.

The William Pitt Union is staffed by two officers employed by
K and S. These were counted in the 100-ofﬁcer estimate, and
are supervised by the public safety department, according to
Brennan. 1   I  A

“I have nothing to hide or reason tolie,” Brennan said.

Graduate and undergraduate enrollment at Pitt for this .

semester is nearly 27,000, making the ratio of campus police
ofﬁcers to students 1 to 600. Carnegie Mellon University
employs about 20 to 25 campus police ofﬁcers, according to the
CMU public-safety department. There are 7,500 undergraduate
and graduate students at CMU, and the ratio of ofﬁcers to
students is about 1 to 300.

Colloquium honors philosophy professor Rescher

By Cindy O’Leary
For T be Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh honored
philosophy Professor Nicholas Rescher
with a three—day colloquium Nov. 15 to 17
to mark three decades of service in the
departments of philosophy and history
and philosophy of science.

The colloquium addressed topics such

as How Scientists Represent the World,
Philosophical Skepticism and Limits of
Knowledge. The host of international
speakers included professors from the
London School of Economics, Princeton
University, Brown and Georg-August
University in Gottingen, Germany.
Philosophy faculty members from Pitt and
Carnegie Mellon University participated
as commentators. Rescher described the

Pitt to install   new president

By Scot Ross
Managing Editor

The installation’ ceremony of
Pitt President]. Dennis O’Connor
‘on Feb. 28 will coincide with the
university’s 205th anniversary,
Provost Donald Henderson said
yesterday.

The university will also be
reviving Founder’s Day for the
ceremony to mark the signing of
the charter that created the
university, Henderson said.

Henderson has created a
committee to oversee the events
and activities of the installation
which includes administrators,
faculty, staff, as well as Student
Government Board President

Brent Saunders and Black Action
Society Chair Marta Efﬁnger.

“This occasion will thus-

celebrate the spirit of beginnings:
for a log cabin built in the 18th-
century wilderness and for a new
president today. At the same time
it will celebrate one of humanity’s
most noblest creations - the
university,” Henderson said. 1

Henderson said he hoped that
Founders’ Day could be a source
of academic inspiration.

“Each year, we could conduct
seminars of national and

international ‘caliber, hold-

appropriate academic ceremonies
and honor our community
purpose and spirit. We will be re-
inventing a fine Pitt tradition."

event as a “panoramic look at the current
state of the art of philosophy.”

Rescher said philosophy allows students
“to uncover layers of knowledge and be
exposed to a rich intellectual tour of
theories of thinking and theorizing.”

He said his main approach to philosophy
is an attempt to merge or create a moderate
opposition between the idealistic and
pragmatic approach. The idealistic

approach deals with abstract ideals, such .

as liberty. The pragmatic or practical
approach centers on the “nuts and bolts
issues,” of daily life, ‘Rescher said.

The colloquium was sponsored by the »

Center for Philosophy of Science, the
Department of History and Philosophy of
Science, Department of Philosophy, the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the
Provost of the University of Pittsburgh.

Coping on Campus

Resolving conﬂicts key to good relationships

In the lastcolumn I wrote about
the problems some students may
develop when their distaste for
conflict is so great that they hide
their true feelings or quietly suffer
many indignities to avoid anxiety
elicited by conflict. It was
suggested that conflict is a normal
part of life and that it is through
the expression of conflict that we
learn more about Ourselves and
others.

There are other students who
are not afraid of engaging in
conflicts but have trouble
resolving them. They may see a
conflict as a win—lose situation
and get so concerned about
winning that they focus only on
their own arguments and never
hear what the other person is
saying. Others may get so lost in

some important relationships.
While conﬂict can deepen a
relationship if the people involved
argue fairly and remain open to
each others’ points of view,
sometimes the discussion can
deteriorate into an angry
emotional exchange. If this
happens, it is probably best to
step away from the argument
and come back to it later, when
both people are ready to utilize
healthy conflict-resolution
strategies. The two people
involved might then agree, for
example, to stick to the topic that

even in non-diisputive discussions
by listening without interruption

to the other person’s point of
view, restating what has been
heard and allowing the other
person to clarify what hasn't been

When two people handle a

both are likely to see some merit ‘

move toward a resolution that
can be satisfactory to both. When
one person wins an angry
exchange, both people invariably
lose. Conﬂict and the expression

a sign of increasing personal

Masloff endangers students

Mayor Sophie Masloffs brilliant plan to remove the most
important fire truck at the station at Louisa Street and
McKee Place may leave many South Oakland residents
worried about the possibility of not being rescued in an
emergency.

The firehouse now possesses two trucks — one with
water and hoses and one with a ladder. The water engine
will be eliminated due to budget constraints, thereby
hinderingthe effectiveness of the department in case of

. an emergency.

“If I were a Pitt student, I wouldn’t live in lower
Oakland,” said fire house captain Brian Devine.

The water truck responds to 80 percent of the fire calls
made from the University of Pittsburgh campus. Although
City‘Fire Chief Charles Dickinson claims the removal of
pumper engine 14 will not affect response time, it is
realistic to believe that lives may be in jeopardy if water
is not immediately available to extinguish a blaze.

In an area heavily populated with college students
(which have proven to be careless in some instances),
accidents are bound to happen. The penalty for
irresponsibility and debauchery, however, should not be
loss of life — which is a strong possibility if truck number
14 is removed from the station which serves us.

South Oakland is a prime target for large fires with
equally large losses of life. Old buildings are crammed
together along the streets, many jammed full with students.

In addition, the inadequate upkeep of many of the

buildings owned by inefficient slumlords also targets
South Oakland as an area which demands that fire-
fighting forces be nearby, alert and ready to respond.

On—campus sites would also be affected by the budget
cuts. ~ - '

If there were a fire in the Towers, Schenley Quad or
even the Cathedral of Learning (incidentally the highest
point in Pittsburgh), the ability of the fire department to
contain the blaze and prevent a high-rise disaster would
be inhibited for the sake of a balanced budget.

It’s no secret that Masloff wants slick ads around
election time announcing how she was able to keep the
city’s ledgerin line.

As she looks toward the votes these ads will garner,
perhaps she should look at the constituency she has
alienated and put in jeopardy.  V ' A

The University of Pittsburgh is the city’s biggest employer
and produces jobs as well as consumers to stimulate the
local economy.

Face it, Oakland would be a ghost town without Pitt.
This does not mean that students should expect extra
consideration; however, they should have the same
protection that other areas in Pittsburgh receive.

Like for instance, the mayor’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood.

OK, maybe not. I’ve got an even better idea.
The Argentines should ask Great Britain for
colonization. This may sound a bitridiculous,

_ especially since the  Argentina'had ‘anything -

to do with ‘a Euieiiean power, the‘ British wiped the
southern hemisphere with them. '

Actually there are a lot of advantages to this idea.
First of all, Argentina would be able to change its
monetary system from the austral, which is worth
about 10 percent of a paper clip, to the British
pound, which is worth roughly the equivalent of
Rockefeller Center. This new monetary system will
not only revive Argentina’s economy, but think of
the paper they’ll save by printing less money.

Of course, given how cheap rain—forest land is
these days, the savings aren’t that great, but every
little bit helps.

Another great advantage for Argentina is that it
won't be tempted to steal sheep from the Falkland
Islands anymore. After all, both will be servants of

arteries. So what kind of rationale
does Great Britain have for colonizing some poor,
innocent South American country? .

That’s simple. They didn’t colonize it in the past.
And you can’t expect the queen of England, who
is still the crown sovereign of Canada (yes, Canada),
not to put a British foothold in South America.

One slight disadvantage of this whole thing is the
fact that England isn’t in such hot shape herself.
Even so, I don’t think the problems facing England

will extend all _the way down to South America.
\Take' the‘poll‘ta‘x for"ir'ista"nc‘e:. Sure, it’s caused a lot

of riotsin England, but I think it’s a pretty safe bet
that in Argentina there are better things to riot over
— things like selling the cadavers of ex—leaders to
rich, American idiots.

Aside from having his country become a territory,

‘Menem doesn’t have many options. He could try

suing Andrew Lloyd Weber for his use of Evita
Péron’s name and likeness in his musical, Evita./, but
I doubt that would succeed. Besides, the lawyer’s
fees would'drive the country even furtherinto the
ground,‘ andgright now even the Falklands have a
better economy.

Colonization isn’t really such a bad thing, anyway.
In the glorious days of imperialism, there was no
such thing as hyperinﬂation or budget deﬁcits or
S&L bailouts.

Hey, wait a second.

I wonder if we could get the British to reconsider
the United States?

Negative connotations spur anger

This letter is in response to the
letter entitled “Soccer coverage
incompetent." My concern, my

Letters

I have a suggestion: Pitt is a
highly diverse institute, so get to
know different people and learn

anger stems from this quote in

about different cultures.

Some may argue that the

 

the letter: “That there are a few
spectators does not frustrate me

nearly as much as the incompetent
reporting done by Ybe Pitt News.

Imagine a Haitian covering an ice

hockey game  “ After reading
the letter, I felt the need to educate
the author about people.

How dare you imply that a
Haitian could not report on an ice
hockey game. Most Haitians are
of African descent, and through

 

my interpretation you don’t
believe (consciously or
subconsciously) that an African
could report on an ice hockey
game. Why not? Was it your
intention to insult people of
African descent with your poor
analogy?

Using analogies with negative
connotations toward people of
different cultures and ethnicities
are offensive and degrading!

For future reference, people of
African descent are strong people
capable of doing anything we so
desire.

I’m quite sure that writing an

article about an ice hockey game_

would not be that great of a
challenge compared to our past
and present challenges!

Pitt hosts Big East volleyball championships

By Ryan Buncher
Stqﬂ‘ Writer

Pitt hosts the Big East volleyball
tournament this weekend at
Fitzgerald Field House, much to
the chagrin of the rest of the
conference. The Lady Panthers
are powerful enough without the
homecourt advantage.

The Panthers are 25-6 and
ranked in the Top 20 in the

nation. They went undefeated in «

the Big East conference this year,
last year and the year before.
Head coach Sue Woodstra has
yet to lose a Big East match. Pitt
also enters the tournament on a
10—match w‘inning
including a three-game

I dismantling of its top challenger
for the conference title, Villanova,
on Nov. 10.

The last three conference
players of the week have been
Panthers. Senior co—captain Sue
Zonneville won it three weeks
ago. Sophomore outside hitter
Ann Marie Lucanie, who is second
in the conference in kills with 4.4
per game and defense with 3.76
digs per_game, was next in line.

5 Senior co-captain Dee MacAulay,

third in blocks with 1.25 per
game and fifth in hitting with a
.302 percentage, got the honor
last week. Pitt also has the
conference assist leader in first-
year setter Annemarie Mernagh,
who has averaged 11.3 per game.
Pitt is also relatively healthy;
senior outside hitter Bridget Gary
is the only question mark.
Woodstra said they will have to
“wait and see” if she will be
available this weekend. .

Boston College is Pitt’s first— :

round opponent, Saturday at
11:30 a.m. The Eagles failed to
win a Big East match all season,
winning only three of 24 matches
overall. The Panthers dispatched
them in three games, 15-5, 15-8,
15-5, on Oct. 18 at BC. The Eagles
are not huge, having only three
players who are six feet tall.-Junior
Heather Cody is the only of the

streak, ‘

three who had any playing time
in the last meeting with Pitt. It
was 5-foot, 9-inch seniorjennifer
McEnroe who had a strong match,
with eight kills, no hitting errors
and seven digs.

The other half of the bracket is
a matchup of fourth seed
Georgetown (21-13, 4-3 in the
Big East) and fifth seed Providence
(20-9, 3-4). The Hoyas won the
regular season match, 15-5, 15-8,
11-15, 15-11. Georgetown sports
two conference leaders in 5-10
junior outside hitter Simone
Kollman (first in kills with 4.6 per
game) and 5-11 senior middle

_ hitter Lisa MacDonald (blocking,

with 1.86 per game).

Looking at the second round,
which will be at 8 p.m. Saturday
night. Pitt has beaten both teams,
but Providence was the only team
in the Big East to take a game
from the Panthers.

The other side of the seeding
begins play at 9 a.m. on Saturday.
Villanova, the second seed, faces
off with seventh seed UConn (10-
17, 1-6), The Huskies are one of
only two teams in the conference
with a losing overall record;
Boston College isthe other.

Villanova actually has the best
overall record in the conference,
30-5, with only one conference
loss. The regular-season match
Oct. 26 was very close, going five
games before Villanova won by

scores of 15-9, 15-8, 12-1 5, 14- 16,

15-13. .

The winner of that match will
face the winner of the match
between third—seeded Syracuse
(19-10, 5-2) and sixth-seeded

..Seton_ Hall (16-13, 2-5). ‘Syracuse

lost. to.only Pitt and ,\_/illanlova in
conference, and it is the biggest
team in the country, with eight
players six feet or taller. That
includes the conference leader in

hitting percentage,  middle...
blocker Jessica Paarleberg, who-

hits at an outstanding .383 percent.
She is also second in blocks with
1.31 per game and was the one

player who gave Pitt trouble in

the Panthers’ three-game sweep
of the Orangewomen on Oct. 27.

.A.nni¢. Parisien is. third in. hitting .

and’ ki11s,,‘,’aii<i‘z§iid}ea Carson. ls
fourth in hitting and leads the
conference in defense with 3.81
digs per game.

The overall defense, which Pitt

head coach Sue Woodstra labeled
terrible, is the problem on this
team. Still, they did blast Seton

Hall 15-7, 15-3, 15-5 in the regular .

season.
Villanova still has to be the

favorite to play the Panthers in

the championship match Sunday

Pitt News File Photo 2
Senior Dee MacAulay leads Pitt in search of its fourth straight Big East tournament title this weekend.

at 2 p.m. Pitt did dominate the
Nov. 10 match at Fitzgerald Field
House, but the Wildcats had

..played two matches the previous
"day,’including a loss to Akron,

and Pitt had been off for over a
week. That just means it will be
closer this time.

National collegefootball playoff system needed

I’ve been hearing this voice, this annoying
echo in my head, for about a month now.
No demonic spirit or anything. Just a
constant echo. It says, “College-football

playoff!” Not by coincidence does this _

echo take place exclusively on Saturday
afternoons. Last Saturday the muffled echo
became a lion’s roar. Just as Florida State
kickerjerry Thomas’ last—minute.f1eld-goal
attempt went inches wide, handing Miami
of Florida a 17-16 win, the now “Huskie”-
sounding echo began screaming, “Dammit,
college-football playoffl”

Well, it got me to thinking in “devil’s
advocate,” antagonist-type fashion. Why
should there be a college-football playoff?
What’s wrong with the present political
crapshoot or, rather, traditional bowl system
that determines the champ? Let me put it
this way: Consider the earth-shaking
repercussions of such a change.

1. Comparison with another playoff
system: college basketball. Look how
predictable “March Madness” has become.
Every year, the same story — An intense,
two-week tournament featuring only the

most deserving teams in the land. The
games are generally described as gut-
wrenching, action-packed and exciting.
Pretty pathetic stuff, huh?‘Wouldn’t want
college football to stoop to such a level of
play, now would we?

2. What will become of the “experts” on
the tube — those overpaid commentators
and ex-jocks who argue about bowl
matchups and poll positions? With a fair
national playoff, what will Beano Cook

question: What will every groggy, hungover
male do from noon ‘til midnight on New
Year’s Day without those eight bowl games?
Maybe communicate with the female
species? Like whatshername? Your wife or
girlfriend. Naah. Too risky. The
conversation could get deeper than the
usual game-day banter, like “Get me a

‘beer, hon” and “Pass the pepto, babe.”

Speaking for all males, we're not ready for
this.
4. The welfare of

and Lee Corso have
left to bitch about? I
worry that these

Brian Gallagher

athletic directors:
What’s left to do

pundits might focus
their attention on (I’ll say it softly) relevant,
sports-related issues. For example, the
mystery of student-athletes (Do they exist?)
or, worse yet, crooked athletic programs?
(Which team has more “generous” alumni?
Auburn or UNLV?)

3. Concern for the U.S. male population.
With this playoff deal, there won’-t be a
need for all those bowls, especially onjan
1. (I still can’t believe they cancelled the

"Cherry Bowl.) What’s even worse is this

I

should bowl-
negotiating duties be relinquished? The
bowl process is a great outlet in which ADS
everywhere can get rid of all that pent-up,
sinister, cut-throat political energy that
makes up the typical AD persona. In the
true, amateur-sport bowl spirit, ADs spend
most of the fall schmoozin g bowl committee
members, fighting to give their “student-
athletes” a memorable college experience
and the school a cool couple of millions.
Even when they set a strict date on which

ADs could start negotiating, it didn’t stop
them. A full three weeks before the signing
date this year, all major bowls were set.
(Now don’t think this group of ADs includes
former Pitt AD Ed “But you said you’d pay
me!” Bozik. That’s giving him too much
credit. Pitt's impeccable bowl bids during
his tenure — more times than not — left
deserving Pitt teams either home for the
holidays or at bowls which didn’t feel
obliged to pay Pitt for participating. You
can’t say he was in it forthe money.) Ok,
I’ll stop. I just worry about what they’ll‘do
all fall semester, that’s all. I’m just that kind
of caring guy.

I guess what I’m saying to my echo is
this: If you see any good coming from an
event that is equally fair and exciting; that
windbag commentators can’t bitch about;
that athletic directors have little inﬂuence
over and that doesn’t take up every minute
of a spectator’s life, then you’ve lost me —-
out the door, on the parkway. Listen, I
gotta get ready for the bowl season. The
Raisin Bowl is only three weeks away. Go
Bowling Green!

C0616/085, athletes sbould S/907/tld cooperate with media

It just never ceases to amaze
me the way people, speciﬁcally
sports personalities, avoid
interviews, dodge certain
questions during an interview or
get upset about a certain question
that is being asked.

As a sportswriter for four years
(I have written for The Pitt News
for two and a large, daily paper
in my hometown for two), I have

seen the way people dodge
questions and have heard more
excuses than anyone could ever
imagine.

Bob Maselli

These men and women, who
assume the responsibility of
“spotlighted human" when they
take on the role of athlete or

coach, don’t like sportswriters.
They feel that people, such as
myself, are always against them.
“We want to hurt them or find all
the ‘dirt’ on them we can. We will
do anything to get people to read
the newspaper.” These are just
some of the comments that a
sportswriter must hear day after
day after day. ‘

players don’t understand is we
really want to get their side of the
story. No honorable, respectable,
professional sportswriter would
do anything other than that.

Now I’m not so naive as to not
know that there are some
sportswriters in the ﬁeld that just
want to hurt someone’s career,
give a certain team a bad name or
just look for stories that cause
controversy, but because of these
few people, sports personalities
judge all sportswriters with this
in mind.

We want to get the story straight.
They fail to realize this simple
fact of life. Sports personalities
are in a position where they are
in the public spotlight.

The public pays to see them
play or supports them in some
manner, and they deserve to get
their views . expressed.
Sportswriters are here to get that
message onto paper for the fans
to read. Coaches-, players and
support staff personal owe it to
their fans to get the message
through.

Just to give an example, about
a month ago I interviewed a
certain head coach of one of the
sports teams here in western
Pennsylvania.

Now I talk to many different
coaches in a week, so nobody
will know who I’m talking about.
In this particular case, one of this
coach’s players was in trouble,
and I asked in so many words
what was going on with the

situation. Well, needless to say
this coach got a tad upset with
me. I mean, all I asked was a
simple question.

Instead of getting upset with
me, he could have simply said,
“Right now we are dealing with
the situation as it goes. There’s
nothing really to say at this time,
but all I can tell you is we are
taking care of it and I’ll let you
know something as soon as it
happens.”

This would have sounded much
better.than, “I have nothing to
say on the matter. It’s none of
your business. Who do you think
you are asking that type of
question? It’s a personal problem
for this athlete and all parties

_ involved.”

“Well, sir,” I said. “I just wanted
to get your side of the story
before I put anything in the paper.
There are people talking, and we
want to get the story straight.”
Needless to say, this coach wasn’ t
much help.

This is just one instance that
has happened over the past two
years, even though I could go on
forever.

It’s a shame that some bad
writers have to ruin it for the rest
of us, but I guess that's life. The
important thing to remember is
that sports personalities must not
generalize. They must help the
sportswriter help them and get
the story across to the fans who
love them and want them to do
well.

will not be an overload of
equipment at a ﬁre. “IWe need]
better efficiency [30 we] can stop
using quarter-of—a-million—dollar
fire trucks as taxicabs,” he said.
Since no fire fighters will be
laid off, many of them maintain
that they are protesting the
proposal in the interest of public

safety, according to House 10 fire
fighter Brian Mofﬁtt.

“We care about the public. They
pay us. We care about their
houses and their children, ” Mofﬁtt
said.

The proposal cannot go into
effect until it is passed by City
Council, which has not yet set a
voting date.

ROTC

Continued from page 3
including day—night land
navigation and ambush
techniques.

Eight members of the Air Force
ROTC learned with the first- and
second-year students.

The last combat of the exercise
occurred when the Ranger Club
and the first- and second-year
cadets conducted a joint ambush
on the junior cadets, who were
returning from an assault. Cadre
members were highly impressed
by the performance of the

attacking cadets.

“Better start bringing out the
body bags,” Major Murraysaid,
referring to the high number of
“casualties” produced by the
ambush.

The FTX concluded with an
awards ceremony for cadets
who showed superior
performance in physical fitness
and academics.

“We have some stellar
performers here. I think it’s
important to recognize them,”
Cassetori said.
