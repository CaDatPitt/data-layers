Wiﬂ Address 

First Meeting 

I)r. James C. Charlesworth, 

sociate professor of political sci-I
ence. will speak at the first organ- 
ization meeting of the lfniversityg
(lclegation to the 1939 Intcrcollc-I
giate Conference on Governmentl
in 216 Cathedral at 3:30 o’clock to-{
day, Miss Genevieve Blatt, executive '
director, announces. All interested.
students are invited to this meeting,
Miss Blatt stated.

The purpose of this meeting, ac-
cording to Saul Dizenfeld, C39, vice
chairman of last year’s delegation, is
to elect officers for the local group.

Freshmen Invited

“This is one of the few activities
in which freshmen are on an equal
level with upperclassmen,” declaresl
Dizenfeld. ‘

The meeting this afternoon should
attract all those students who are in-
terested in American government,
including those enrolled in the gov-
ernment course and in political sci-
ences and social sciences.

Founded in 1933 by Miss Gene-
vieve Blatt, L36, and John P. Brack-
en, C33, the ICG has grown from a
class room laboratory to a permanent
organization composed of students
representing over 30 Pennsylvania
colleges and universities.

Model Legislature

Miss Blatt, who has been execu-
tive director of the past ﬁve confer-
ences announces, “Our purpose is
simply to provide means whereby
students may learn exactly how
their government operates.”

ICG sponsors dramatizations of
governmental activity every year in
the state capitol at Harrisburg. This
year, from April 20 to April 23, it
will hold a model unicameral state
legislature which will operate under
the provisions of the model state con-
stitution adopted by the National

Quill_Club Requests
New Student MSS.

Quill Club, honorary literary fra-
ternity, is prepared to receive man-
uscripts from those students desiring
admission into the club, announces
Robert Brown, C39, president.

Manuscripts may be of any length,
and the subject matter may be band-
led in essay, short story, verse, sketch
or other approved literary forms.

“We are interested primarily in
discovering whether the student has
been able to make use of the tech-
nique he has secured in class,” Brown
said. “Therefore, although he may
possibly do his best work in writing
themes, we wish to see what he can
do with one of the larger forms.”

Entries may be turned into the
main office of the English depart-
ment, 2004 Cathedral, or into The
Pitt‘News office, 1330 Cathedral.

Quill Club will meet tonight in
1201 Cathedral at 8:15 p. m.

Clergy ‘Propagandize Religion’ I

Before Monday Forum Audience

A
7

By Fred S. Robie
Speakers of three faiths presentedl

their ideas and answered questionsi

for a group of about 100 students at,
lVlonday’s Inquiry Forum. ‘
As he introduced Reverend A. J.
Muste, pastor of the Labor Temple;
Presbyterian church of New Yorki
City, Rabbi Hailperin of the Tree of
Life synagogue, and Dr. L. C. O’Con- '

nell, dean of the School of Pharmacy, 
Dr. Bernard C. Clausen, pastor of the f
First Baptist church, explained thati
this presentation of Protestant, Jew,’
and Catholic representatives is the
latest step in a movement for “pro-
pagandizing religion.”

Reverend Muste divided the main-
tenance of the democratic processes
into four parts. as he tried to an-
swer the question, “Do
Democracy?”

He said that: (1) racial and religi-
ous tolerance on our own door-
step as well as abroad is essential;
(2) freedom of speech and discus-
sion for the person with whom we
fundamentally disagree is necessary;

We Need
I

.
I

(3) we must have a struggle for eco-
nomic justice; and (4) there must be
opportunity for free association in
order that an individual might have
“elbow room” to express his desires.

Rabbi Hailperin expressed the
same View when he said, “Every in-
dividual is an end in himself and
must not be made a tool of another.
The situation hinges on the differ-
ence between religious ethics and
non—religious ethics.”

Non-religious ethics, he illustrated
[as those which allow a person to
isupport communism or socialism
;when his economic station is low and
Ito uphold a capitalistic plan when
lhe becomes wealthy.
;ethics, he deﬁnes as one which re-
Iquire a consistency of behavior.
Dean O’Connell explained the mis-
Iunderstandings of the Catholic
!church, as he pointed out that the
IChurch believes in the “intrinsic”
gvalues of the individual. He went
Ion to add that the rights of individ-
’uals cannot be transgressed by any

group.

Hobby Clubs

Latest project of Men’s Council
is an effort to organize hobby
clubs at the University. This will
satisfy a need that has long been
felt by both students and faculty
members, according to Morton A.
Weissman, BA40, chairman of hob-
by clubs.

Realizing that there are many
hobbies represented among the
students, Weissman says, “Men’s
Council aims to ﬁnd out what these
hobbies are and to give the stu-
dents with the same hobby a
chance to get together.”

Men’s Council plans a display
showing the collections of various
members of the hobby clubs to be
placed in a showcase, probably
during Spring Festival week.

Interested only in getting the
students together and providing
them with a place to meet, lVIen’s
Council will leave the organization
work and election of officers upto
the individual members of the
clubs. .

Faculty-members as well as stu-
dents are invited to participate in

Reports Excellent
Student Response

“Reports from several groups
which sponsored Monday’s Campus
Conference activities indicate that
the program is receiving satisfactory
response from the student body,”
says Dr. S. P. Franklin, professor of
religious education, local chairman.

Opportunities for the faculty and
campus groups to get together and
discuss the place and importance of
religion in modern life are being
made possible daily through the pro-
grams. Today’s activities will be
emphasized in the Schools of Pharm-
acy and Law and among YM and
YWCA groups.

University Mission and the group
of local and out-of-town speakers
will continue to appear before groups
in seminars and=.:1specia_1 meetings to-
morrow and Friday, when Religious
Emphasis Week will be brought to a
close. Carnegie Institute of Tech-

Women are also hosts to the speak-
ers who have participated in nearly
30 events at these schools as well as
the University program.

In addition to the regularly sched-
uled meetings, students with prob-
lems or ideas have been invited to
approach speakers in an effort to
solve the problem through a personal
interview. Such interviews can be
‘arfanged at the personal interview
desks in the various schools.

A booth has been set up on the
ground ﬂoor where students may ob-
tain literature pertaining to the con-
ference and matters of religion and
philosophical living. At the conclu-
sion of the conference on Friday,
campus leaders will appear on a
WWSW radio program to tell “What

it was found that 21 quorum was
not present, and that a vote could
not be taken. The o_11<-stion for :1
vote was called at the conclusion of
the meeting, after many members had
Ieft.

Earlier in the day, the Executive
Committee of SFA had designated
Francis Durkin, BA39, as iets,'repre.—_
sentative on the executive board of
the student committee investigating
the refugee problem. ' '

During the course of the discussion
last night, Durkin emphasized that
his appointment to the committee‘
does not necessarily mean SFA ap-
proval of the plan. The Executive
Committee's action in appointing him,-
he said, was merely indicative of a
desire to investigate the possibilities
of the plan.

Sipes Objects

Immediately after Hoeveler had in-
troduced his motion, Brooks Sipes,
C39, declared opposition to any plan
helping “aliens.” He said, “We’re
not taking a negative attitude, but
our policy should be to alleviate our-
own problems ﬁrst.”

Sipes then proposed a counter-plan .
to raise funds to educate American
students. He proposed that SFA
should instead express itself in favor
of aid to Americans, claiming that
“it is useless to try to provide for the
intellectual well-being of foreigners
when we are not providing for the
physical well-being of Americans.”

Representatives to the executive
board of the committee investigat-
ing the refugee-aid problem were
announced yesterday by Panhel-
lenic Council and Interfraternity
Council.

Betty Batty, E6140, president of
Panhel, was designated to repre-
sent her group on the comn1itliee,.-
Members of the Panhel executive
committee--:-f individuallyaiexpressed ,

themselves as favoring the p,!'0-~ _

posed student-refugee project.

Bernard Cashdollar, BA39, In.ter'-—-
fraternity Council president, will
act as the men’s fraternity delegate -
to the committee.

Attacking Sipes’ criticisms, ‘Ed’:

Springer, C39, said, “If it were clear‘

that we were taking money from‘:

Americans, I would be against the"

plan.” He then pointed out ‘ that
heretofore there had ‘been no stu-
dent-sponsored plan to help anyone,

and called Sipes’ views “narrow,Ina—

tionalistic, and dangerous.”_. .

Bernard Cashdollar, BA39, ex-
pressed himself in favor of aiding
both refugee students and Americans.
He likened the proposed refugee-aid
plan to the activities of the American
Red Cross in helping victims of dis-
aster regardless of nationality.

To clarify the status of the project
as it now exists, John Martinco, C39,

Sing Results

With ‘it Pays to

By Regina Heinz

“It pays to advertise” sang the
members of Kappa Alpha Theta Mon-
day evening at Heinz House, as proﬁts
promptly came their way in the form
of a loving cup signifying that they
had won ﬁrst place in the annual
panhellenic sing.

Alpha Delta Pi’s skit was judged
second best, and last year’s winner,
Zeta Tau Alpha, took third place.

This year the theme for the vari-
ous sketches was “Advertising.” Each
group selected the slogan of an ad-
vertised product and patterned a skit
around it.

The prize-winning Thetas were
costumed to represent various pro-
ducts such as electric lamps, cleanser,
toothpaste, paint, cigarettes and jello.
Each slogan was sung and connected
with one of the other fraternities. The
“Two Perfect Little Maids” who were
the subject of the last song repre-
sented the Thetas.

A barber shop quartet helped
dramatize the “5 o’clock” tragedy

which members of Alpha Delta Pi
were sure Gem blades would have
averted.

ZTA’s brought campus politics into‘
their skit. Both John Downie and
Jack Hoevler were impersonated and-
insisted that “I’d Rather Be Right.”

The other fraternities advertised:
various products. Phi Mu’s skit was
about Aunt Jemima’s flour, while
Kappa Kappa Gamma’s was based
on the International Correspondence
school. Chi Omega members
“Watched the Fords Go By” and Del-
ta Delta Delta women sang about
Wheaties.

Clove Gum was the subject of the
Phi Sigma Sigma sketch. The Al-
pha Epsilon Phi subject was Palm-
olive soap, while Delta Zeta’s theme
was Four Roses. Beta Sigma Omi-
cron women sang about Atlantic
White Flash and members of Beta
Phi Alpha’s used Chase and Sanborn
coffee as a theme.

A Forum Gets
‘Undue Publicity’

EVE licard a little comment recently about

the 21111011111; of publicit_v we have been giving
Inquiry Forum iii The News. \V'l1y, ask the
critic.~;, should an organization the nature of the
For111n, whose attcnda11ce is not always too i1np1'es-
sive, be consistently given such prominent space
in the paper‘?

Our answer to that is twofold: (1) \\'e think
Iiiquiry Forum a very wortllwhile organization,
presenting as it does discussions of pressing prob-
lems of the day by informed and capable speakers;
(2) V‘Vc think l11quir_v ﬁlls :1 need on campus which
both the Uxiiversitv and other, more representative
ca1np11s organizations have secnliiigly failed to
recognize.

The first poi11t is quite obvious and self-explana-
tory. The second, although growing partly out of
the ﬁrst considcrzition, is important in that it re-
veals an unusual situation on campus.

As far as we can recall, not one University-wide
asse1nbl_v, touching upon vital current problems,
luis been sponsored by the University or other cam-

that

pus group during the present school year. To be llfalgler ;  Mirijﬁrfhatls N; :‘tie”A‘l;1“nge an: ‘glhngy

pep assemblies, in fact; and there have been ﬁne
concerts and musical programs.

But it has been quite awhile since students have
been given an oppo1't11nit_v to hear any prominent
speakers on p1'essi11g problems of the day, political,
socieil, cc-.011o111lc. and cultural.

This. we think, is 21 situation which should be
deplored. Students at the University, we are c011-
vinccd are eager to hear opinions on and to discuss
current affairs. Just witness the success of the cur-
1'enti“Ca1npus Cont'c1'encc on Religion and Life.”

l11quir_v Fo1'u111. in the llllll(lS of niany, ﬁlls this
void wliich the Uiiivcrsity, SFA, and other eligible
01‘g‘:111izatlons have apparently neglected to fill. It
teiidis to at least? pm-tia]l_v slakc the thirst of an in-
tcllect11all_v parched student body.

Just as long as this is the case, The News will
oonthiue to give full and adequate publicit_v to an
.org;u1izz1tiou which it considers quite wo1'tl1wl1ile.

‘One: More Country

OT ‘S.O.loug ago, it seems, everybody was talk-
ing about Czechoslovakia and l1ow it had been
“sold down the river” by the world’s “democra-
cies. ” Today, with much less protest and decidedly
less bystander interest, the same thing is happen-
ing in Spain.

Only Spain (we refer, of course, to the Loyalist
govcrn1ne11t) is still ﬂoundering around in the mid-
dlc of that river. struggling desperately to keep
from going dow11 for the third time.

Twice already the Loyalist government has

down the river, to the fate of all reorganization bills.

According to reports from Washington, one of the
major measures to be considered by the current session
of Congress is government reorganization, which last
year raised such a nation—wide controversy resulting
in the failure of a somewhat similar measure. The
writer, in this column, explores the background of pro-
posals for administrative reorganization.

Franklin D. Roosevelt is not the only president who
ever wanted to tamper with the administrative structure
of our federal government. Every chief executive since
Theodore Roosevelt has had an urge to “reorganize”
when he viewed the inefficiency caused by existence of
outmoded executive machinery. Congressmen and oth-
ers familiar with the subject admit the need of reform,
but they differ as to how it should be accomplished.
Theodore Roosevelt took the ﬁrst step when he ap-
pointed the Keep commission to investigate inefficiency
in several administrative departments. The commission
found, among other things, that positions and salaries
were classiﬁed according to an act of Congress passed
50 years before. Recommendations to Congress Lior
modernizing the system were ignored.

During Taft’s term the problem became so acute that
Congress was forced to enact budgetary measures to cut
down on waste of government funds.

By 1920 Congress awoke to the need of reform and
created the Joint Committee on Reorganization. The
Committee reported bureaus serving under wrong de-
partments, similar services scattered among several dif-
ferent bureaus, bureaus lacking proper control, and bu-
reaus having no connection with any of the ten depart-
ments.

In that year, Congress authorized a federal budget
for which the president assumed responsibility. But no
plan for departmental reorganization has since gained
enough supporters to insure passage. In the meantime,
Congress created many new agencies to handle emer-
gency legislation during the depression; consequently,
the old 2'-.d1ninist1'ative evils have been greatly supple-
I-nented.

Before Hoover went out of ofﬁce, he submitted a plan
which :1 hostile Democratic Congress killed; today a
president and Congress of the same party are no nearer
agreement.

Or Educate Aliens?
Editor, The Pitt News,

Dear Sir:

Your recent editorial on “Charity
Begins at Home” prompts me to ask
the following questions:

Has it ever occurred to you that
there have been withdrawals of
splendid American students from this
as well as other universities and col-
leges purely because of lack of funds
with which to continue their studies?
Don’t you think that it might be bet-
ter to expend your energies in help-
ing to return these students to classes
rather than in‘ supporting a plan of
help to aliens?

Americans vs. Foreigners

Has it ever occurred to you that it
is better to FEED Americans than to
EDUCATE foreigners; or do you
place alien intellectual welfare ahead
of American physical welfare‘7.’

Has it ever occurred to you that it
is open to question whether or not
foreigners, with a different language,
with different legal and social insti-
tutions, of a diﬁerent common heri-
tage, a diﬁerent political philosophy
and a different social outlook make
better American citizens than those
born here? Does a common interest
have no weight in inﬂuencing your
choice of ﬁelds in which to apply
your humanitarian principles?

Do you believe in the principle of
starting many things and ﬁnishing
none? Or would you suggest that we
inaugurate a campaign to help an-
other University build a Student
Union house instead of a campaign
to build one here? The principle is
the same. '

- Applauds Humanitarian Principles
I applaud your humanitarian prin-
ciples but question your choice of a
ﬁeld in which to apply them.

You are hereby invited to join the
now organizing group which intends
to spend every available cent that
can be raised on AMERICAN stu-
dents. In case you accept our invita-
tion to join us, you will be expected
to memorize our slogan:-our only en- v
trance requirement. Here it is:
MILLIONS FOR AMERICAN STU-
DENTS; NOT ONE CENT FOR FOR-
EIGNERS.

Sincerely yours,
Brooks N. Sipes. C39.

(We’re seriously considering your
kind invitation. But, shucks, M-r..*
Sipes, we never were much good at
memorizing. I.<:n’t there any other
way we can qualify?—The Ed'ltor.)

COLLEGE JOURNALISM ‘1

Nat Finney, l‘/Iinneapolis Star:

“The level of college journalism has
increased substantially the past few;
vears. The colleges are more alert‘,
"oclay than formerly in recognizing:
things of news value.” 3

CAMPUS OPINION §
President Dexter M. Keezer, Rec-(ll
College: ‘
“The general understanding that
schol'.)rs are necessarrly free mu:
would be promoted if there r3..r.li-
ated from our colleges and univer-
sities news reflecting the wide range
of opinion on coni1'oversi<:.l issues

pus.”

Dr. Clyde M. Hill. Yale 'University: 2

“We have too many people teach-6

‘Charity’. . Comeback
Boos Not Apply

Editor, The Pitt News.
Dear Sir:

As a still-interested alumnus, I
have followed—irregu1a1'ly_. to be sure
——the progress of your cause in The
News. Lacking the knowledge, as
well as the desire, to comment on the
broad aspects of the drive, I am nev-
ertheless intrigued by a particularly
quaint axiom which has been raised
in protest to the plan.

I refer, of course, to that old stand-
by: “Charity begins at home.” I have

heard it declared with great convic— =

tion by various students, and I imag-
ine that it has appeared in letters to
the editor of The News.
Local Students Not Forsaken

And well it might. Nobody who
has attended school during the last
several years; who has watched the
gallant ﬁght for an education made
by some of our students; who has
seen the hopes of high school class-
mates smashed by ﬁnancial problems
——none of us—would suggest that
these people should be forsaken for

outsiders. To my knowledge, no-
body has.
The refugee campaign, which at

worst seems to reflect our national
sentiment on the more general prob-
lem of refugee treatment, is a tem-
porary movement: to meet a tem-
porary situation. As yet, there have
been no proposals to establish, say,
a Bureau of Refugee Education.
When there are, they will have little
in common with the current" drive.
Clearly, the hu_mani:tarian aspects

'of the drive cannot be matched by

patriotic maxims, however signiﬁcant
they may be in normal times. Nor-
mally, the refugee is not “always with
us.”
Home Conditions Play Part
The reason deserving Pittsburgh
boys and girls do not go to college is
not that they merely cannot afford it:
it is that they must work to help re-
lieve the ﬁnancial strain at home.
Considering this, as well as the
temporary nature of the drive. one is
inclined to believe that the “Charity”
line does n.ot quite apply here.
Sincerely,
Richard Cooper, C38.

Little realized is the severity with which the latest departure
-from the ranks of the day—by-day—dwindling football coaching staff
strikes . . . Mike Milligan, who follows Josh to the land of sunshine,
was one of the most capable instructors the department ever had . . .
he handled, simultaneously such assignments as the freshman club,
the guards, and the supervision of gridiron scholarship . . . he will

be missed . .

His withdrawal makes the third of
the post-season period there
are rumors of more to come . . . soon

. replacements will probably be
forthcoming in the next few weeks
. . the word seems to be that there
is a likelihood that more seasoned as-
sistants will be contracted . . be-
ing that the departures have been
among the veteran staff members
similar men will be sought
which takes us back to the ’34 team

-considered by many as one of the
University’s greatest Captain
Doc Hartwig was one of the guards
and the great Weinstock was the full-
back . . the “Doc” is now coach-
ing a high school team in the West
Virginia hills . . . Weinstock, who, in
the light of pure fullbacking was
ranked as one of the best, has served
time in the post-graduate pro-league
and also put in a semester as fresh-
man tutor for the Carnegie plebes
. . he is now on the loose .
both are men of experience . . a
quality that seems to be in demand

and both know football as it
should be known . . .

The bust-up of the Eastern Inter-
collegiate Basketball Conference,
promulgated at the PAA the other
day was certainly not unexpected

. since the Panthers depledged,
the Conference days were known to
be numbered . . . with regard to the
Conference, we pick Elmer Ripley’s
Georgetown Hoyas to get the last
licks in on the plaque this
choice comes after watching every
team in action except the Mountain-
eers, who are virtually out of the
running.

Best in the way of shooting, the
Hoyas appear to be league’s most
capable although the unpre-
dictable Panthers might lock them
up in a three way tie .

tions for an improvement in the

That never-failing sign of spring,
a baseball team’s ﬁrst workout, ap-
pears tomorrow afternoon when
coach Ralph Mitterling gets his ﬁrst
look at the boys who will do the
pitching and catching for the ﬁrst
Pitt baseball team since 1924.

Only those men eligible for varsity
competition will report to Gate 3 of
the Stadium at 3:30 o’clock tomor-
dow, the frosh waiting until later in
the month to show their stuff.

The probability that football play-
ers will not go out for the team be-
cause of the conflict of the schedule
with spring football training may
prove a blow to the battery corps.
Ben Kish’s recent trip to the hospital
with appendicitis ruined one excel-
lent hurling prospect.

Athletic record cards, signifying
varsity eligibility, must be obtained
by all candidates and completed be-
fore reporting for practice. The
cards may be secured from Mr.
Whitson in the Stadium equipment
room where further information re-
garding them will be given.

Equipment, eonsisting of old
clothes, tennis shoes, and ﬁelders’

gloves must be supplied by the boys
themselves, the University provid-

‘ing catchers’ mitts and balls.

Candidates for manager and as-
sistant managers should report to

WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY

By Bill McElwa.in

A dearth of top-notch battles in
Engineering and Independent bas-
ketball competition this evening
still leaves the way open for some
of the two circuits’ less potent
contiiigents to push themselves
farther up in the respective races by
victories.

With Caldwell leading the way,
the Chem Seniors are conﬁdent of
erasing the feeble Industrial ﬁve and
strengthening their grasp on third
place when the two clubs tangle in
the Stadium at 7 o’clock.

The last place Bunnies should give
little trouble to the YMCA boys in
the 7 o’clock Trees Gym game, while
the same condition exists in the 8
o’clock match up at the gym featur-
ing the fourth place Ramblers
against the hopeless Demons.

Back at the Stadium at 8 o’clock,
the Metallurgists have an outside
chance to swing into the middle of
the title race when they oppose the
AE & ME club. The latter group is
now in second place with three vic-
tories and only one loss.

With Croker set for another star-
ring role, the division leaders, the
unbeaten Oil and Gas quintet, are
heavy favorites to take over the
Chem Frosh and their high scoring
Caldwell in the 9 o’clock Stadium
ﬁnale. The O. & G. crew has rolled
up ﬁve wins without a reverse since
the season began.

Kappa Alpha Psi and the Dents,
neither of whom are going any-
where, battle, if it can be called that,
for seventh place in the Trees Gym
at 9 o’clock show. Both clubs have
records of two games to the good
with ﬁve on the wrong side of the
books.

The Arrows, Independent loop
standard bearers, stayed in ﬁrst
place the easy way last Friday when
their opponents, the Ramblers, either
got lost or were frightened away with
a forfeit the result.

Another failure to appear gave the
All—Stars their second win as the
Dents stayed away from their sched-
uled engagement.

Pitt Club, paced as usual by Bul-
let Bill P.uskin, eliminated the
YMCA by a 24-17 count. Ruskin ac-
counted for 10 of the winners’ tallies,
Reichold getting eight for the Y
crowd.

By lVIike hlitchell

Last Monday night. at Gainbier, Ohio, the Pitt mernien severed
Kenyoii College '5 wiiiiiiiig streak of twenty-seven victories when they
stroked ahead by a decisive 52-‘I23 score. The victory helped compen-

In the Ohio State meet. which was witnessed by nearly 7,000 spec-

tators, the national ranking Buckeyes?

captured first in all the events except
the 50-yard freestyle, in which co-

finish mark a hair breadth ahead of
OSU's Howell.

The Pitt—Kenyon meet was a battle
between the champions of the East-
ern Collegiate Association and the
Ohio Conference, respectively. When
Kell)'Oil~ became a member of the
Eastern Conference this year for the
first time, its chances of displacing
Pitt from its Eastern throne were
considered high, due to its impressive
record. However, the Corrians vic-

The Chem Frosh pulled up to an
even .500 for the season by upsetting
the Chem Seniors, 24-19. Hunt’s
eight markers led the Frosh witli
Caldwell sparking the Seniors with
one point less.

Despite Bill Williams’ 10 point
burst, the Chem Juniors easily took
over the Civil Engineers by a 28-19
margin. Ralph Hafer, reserve tackle
on the once powerful Sutherland
Scythe, dipped into his scoring re-
sources for eight of the victor’s
markers.

The Oil & Gas aggregation re-

better than the Electrical’s ace,

Pitt’s capable relay team split
even in a pair of contests over the
week-end. Last Friday the Panthers
ran in the Penn AC games in Phila-
delphia, where they succeeded in
setting a new record for their event
although their mark was later equal-
ed by Princeton and Georgetown.

Because of the large number of
entries, the relays were run off in
heats with three teams being in each
heat. Running in the ﬁrst heat of
the evening, Pitt’s opponents were
to be Penn State and Temple for the

Remain In Race

Eddie Straloski’s sharp-shooting
and ﬂoor maneuvering propped Pitt
on the best end of a 43-41 score
against Georgetown’s Hoyas Monday
night, in the Stadium.

The ﬁrst three minutes of the con-
test the few spectators were treated
to some snappy passing exhibitions
by both ﬁves. And it wasn't until
3:05 that Straloski warmed the net
for Pitt. From this point on the
Blue and Gold controlled the action
during the entire ﬁrst half. George-
town’s courtmen just couldn't ﬁnd
their mark. The score at the half-
time was, Pitt, 23—Georgetown, 18

Straloski topped Kurtyka for high
scoring honor by merely one point.
His grand total was 16. McGowan
registered ﬁve buckets for 10 points,
and Pitt’s Kocheran and Paifrath
were next in line with 8 apiece.

Relay Team Sets Ma,rk
In Philadelphia Win

trouble. Their time of 3 minutes,
29 seconds clipped four seconds off
the old record.

The next day Coach Olson had his
men in Boston where they partici-

pated in the Boston AC games. Run-
ning against Fordham for the East-
ern Seaboard title, the Panthers suf-
fered a let-down and ﬁnished up a
poor second. Larry Tregonning, sub-
stituting for Johnnny Woodruff, was
forced to run with a blistered foot,
caused by tight shoes, but the race
was already lost when he received
the baton.

Next meet for the locals will be
the NYAC meet in New York
this Saturday. In addition to his re-
lay team, Olson will probably take
Ken Ryden, hurdling ace. Although
he is out of the hospital, Johnny
Woodruff will be unable to run for
several days yet.

These games in New York Satur-
day are ranked among the high points
of the indoor season. With two meets
serving as experience molders, the
Pitt relay team should be about set
to step out almost to the point where
it was last year when Johnny Wood-
riiﬂ‘ was running anchor.

Indian Secretariat
Talks on Religion

Attired in typical Indian re-
galia which included turban and
ﬂowing cloak, Samuel Masih, for-
mer member of the India secre-
tariat, gave a colorful account of
“Christianity’s Contributian to In-
dia” at a Monday afternoon semin-
ar in 149 Cathedral.

Mr. Masih pointed out the en-
lightening influence of Christian-
ity in the development of India.
Citing chieﬂy the effect of Ma-
hatma Ghandi’s control among the
castes, the role of the Yogis, trans-
migration, and the proposed bill to
outlay polygamy and polyandry,
he drew parallels between pro-
gress in government and progress
in education and religion.

The keynote of the Indian edu-
cator’s address struck at the sud-
den elevation of women’s stand-
ards in‘ India, as the result of
Christianity’s inﬂuence.

Churchman Talks

To Journalists

Public interest in the vital part
religion is now playing in world
affairs is increasing, according to
the Reverend Roswell ’P. Barnes,
associate secretary of the Federal
Council of Churches.

Speaking on Monday before
Robert X. Graham’s journalism
class, on “Religion in the Newspa-
pers,” Reverend Barnes said that
because of this increasing impor-
tance, the nation’s press is now
treating religion “much more seri-
ously.”

Reasons for this rising interest
and importance, Rev. Barnes point-
ed out, may be attributed in part
to the rise of totalitarian states.
One of the outstanding issues in
the battle of totalitarianism vs.
democracy is religion.

“Religion thinks of man as an in-
dividual, which is in opposition to
a totalitarian regime's idea of
man,” said Rev. Barnes.
