In an effort to promote volun-
teerism and corrlmunity out-
reach at Pitt, the University has
formed a new committee and an
afﬁliated student organization.

This committee, known as
the Pitt Serves Committee,
represents the culmination of
more than a year’s work by sev-
eral members of the University
administration and will host

*rHI=.”c

the Student Civic Engagement

Committee, its student arm. Al-
though whether or not these two
initiatives will create a campus
environment more amenable to
volunteerism is uncertain.
“The Office of Pitt Serves
cannot simply plan service proj-
ects, it must be the catalyst for
a much-needed cultural shift at
the University of Pittsburgh,”
said Pitt senior and SCEC Execu-
tive Directo_r _Wasi Mohamed,

SCEC, which hopes to play a
large role in volunteerism and
community outreach at Pitt in
the future, is a subset of the
larger Pitt.Serves Committee
and will fall under the Ofﬁce of
Student Affairs. SCEC hopes to
serve as a resource for students

ing for volunteer opportunities -

Pitt alumna Deborah Walker joked that the
female freshman students she addressed
had received many letters from the Univer-
sity, but she had one more letter to share
with them.

In it, she shared with the young women
how Pitt has shaped her life and how it will
shape theirs. -

“Everything I am, everything I have
achieved and everything I will become is a
result of my 30 years at Pitt,”‘said Walker,
who manages the Office of Student Conduct
and obtained her undergraduate degree at
Pitt in 2001 and master’s degree in 2003.

Walker was addressing the more than
630 female students and 45 alumnae who
took part in the 93rd annual Lantern night,
an annual event at the Heinz Memorial Cha~
pel Sunday evening.

The tradition, which is Pitt’s oldest,
began in 1920. Since then, female alumni
have served as “ﬂame bearers,” carrying
candles and lighting the lanterns of new
Pitt students in a night that is meant to
symbolize the transference of the “light
of learning.” ‘

Cheryl Huttenhower, Pitt alumna and
mother of third—generation Pitt student
Danielle Huttenhower, lit her daughter’s

' candle Sunday night as a symbol of the
passing of knowledge from generation to
generation.

“It’s great that she is going here and
following in my footsteps,” said the elder
Huttenhower, a 1982 Arts and Sciences
graduate who also holds two master’s de-
grees from Pitt. ‘-

Lantern Night Chairwoman Juliana
Shayne invoked tradition in her opening
remarks to attendees.

“As you participate, you are demonstrat-
ing your wish to become an integral part

' of the University,” she told the female stu-
dents. “As you seek knowledge, remember
the ﬁrst students and faculty of years ago in
your efforts as you begin to follpw them.”

Two student speakers, Pitt senior Caro-
lyn Lewis, president of the Collegiate Pan-
hellenic Association at Pitt, and.Dani Per-
due, president of the National Pan-Hellenic
Council, advised the students on how to
make the best of their years at Pitt.

“Find something that truly challenges
you,” said Lewis. “Something that chal-
lenges you to your core. Makes you think
about the world in a different light and
changes you as person.”

Perdue, a second—generation' Pitt stu-
dent, advised the young women to “think

  Pitt
welcomes

class of
2017

Danielle Fox
Stqff Writer

The elected leader of Pitt’s'student body
made it his goal to be accessible to students
of the Class of 2017.

During the welcoming remarks by Stu-
dent Government Board president Gordon
Louderback, he asked the incoming fresh-
man class to save his email address in their
phones. He promised he’d be there if they
had any questions as they started school.

“As student government president, it’s
my job to represent you by working with
Pitt administration, local and national rep-
resentatives to advocate for Pitt students,”
he said. _ A

Louderback was one of four speakers
to address Pitt’s largest freshman class
to date when he spoke at the Freshman
Convocation Wednesday afterno'on, which
took place at the Petersen Events Center.
In addition to Louderback, several senior
administrators welcomed this year’s fresh-
man class of about 3,500 students.

Provost and Senior Chancellor Patricia
Beeson noted that Pitt has been an institu-
tion for more than 225 years. Even though
the students were new to this “honored
tradition,” she told them, “you are now
our future and we are counting on you to
make the world a better place.” ‘

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg spoke to
the students about Pitt’s previous achieve-
ments before their arrival on campus.

Speciﬁcally, the University received a
positive external assessment of its prog-
ress from a team representing the Middle
States Commission on Higher Education,
an independent educational accreditation
company. Nordenberg noted that Pitt has
ascended to the top ranks of the country’s
ﬁnest universities for research.

“By any measure, this reputational

Students packed into the -Petersen Events
Center on Sunday from 2 to 5 p.m. for the
annual Activities Fair, shuffling from booth
to booth with hopes of getting involved on
campus or simply acquiring an array of
free T—shirts. '

The goals of the Activities Fair are to
help students ﬁnd organizations on.cam-
pus that interest them and to encourage
campus involvement. Gina Scozzaro, the
business manager of the Student Organi-
zation Resource Center, said the activities
fair hosted 345 student organizations this
year out of the 400 that are registered with
SORC —- about 15 more booths than were
present last year.

Scozzaro said that between 5,000 and
7,000 students attend the fair each year,
searching for groups to join. The fair is open
to both incoming students and upperclass-
men who are looking to get involved.

To attend the fair to recruit members,

a registered organization must register on

the SORC website. ‘

“We do see a lot of sophomores that
come that ‘didn’t really get involved their
freshman year, so now they’re looking for
something extracurricular,” she said. “We
keep growing every year. We get more or-
ganizations every year and more groups-
come to the fair every year.”

She said that a large portion of newer
groups on campus are organizations de-
voted to service, such as/Global Brigades.

' Siyu Xiao, a senior molecular biol-
ogy major and the campus chairwoman of
Global Brigades, said that the organization
focuses on international development in
Panama, Honduras, Ghana and Nicaragua.

There are ﬁve chapters of Global Bri-
gades at Pitt —— including environmental,
business, medical, public health and water
—— which collaborate with one another in
different ways. Xiao said that the Activities
Fair is really important to the organiza-
tion because it’s a great chance to recruit
students, especially freshmen.

Activities Fair promotes campus involement

“There’s opportunities for any student
with any major or interest to get involved,
not just abroad, but also on campus if they
can’t afford to go abroad,” Xiao said.

Another new organization on campus
is Off The Hook, a club instituted over the
summer by Emily Blume, a junior majoring
in English literature.

“Oif The Hook is a community of stu-
dents from all backgrounds  who are look-
ing for an alternative to the hook-up culture
by recognizing each person’s dignity and
promoting mutual respect,” Blume said.

Off The Hook looks at issues of sexual
integrity from an intellectual standpoint as
opposed to a religious standpoint and pro-.
vides a supportive environmentfor students
to discuss these issues with an open mind.

“One of the most important things [Off
The Hook] wants students to know is that
there is, in fact, a way to live a full, ﬂourish-
ing college life without feeling the need to
have casual sex or casual hookups,” Blume

Construction projects
advance over summer

Em Maier
Assistant News Editor

When Rebecca Lebens returned to Pitt
— and the country — after a year study-
ing abroad in Europe, she was surprised
to witness the changes on campus since
her departure.

“I came back, and there was a whole
new dorm that I’d never heard of,” Leb-
ens said.

Before her departure, what is now
Nordenberg Hall was a small parking lot.

“In a way, I’m getting to know the
campus and Pitt all over again, but it
could be more interesting than seeing
the same things all over again.”

The University completed eleven
construction projects over the summer,
many of which were only begun after
classes ended in May. In addition to a
new dorm and extensive renovations to
the bookstore, several other facilities

on campus haveundergone signiﬁcant
renovations. While some of these proj-
ects included new construction, others
aimed at modernizing facilities.

The Graduate School of Public Health
continued renovations on both Parran
and Crabtree Halls. The project in-
cludes a ﬁve—story, 57,000-square—foot
addition along with renovations in the
building’s labs and auditorium. In 2006,
the University decided to spend $40
million for the construction project in
the school of public health’s buildings.
The state granted an additional $32 mil-
lion, according to Pitt spokesmanjohn
Fedele.

Classrooms in Salk Hall, David Law-
rence Hall and the Information Sciences
Building were also reconﬁgured with
new white boards, audio—visual com-

TeleFund, Pitt’s telephone fundraising
service, suspended its calling operation
for a few weeks to take time to con-
sider new ways to communicate with
Pitt alumni.

“The way the world communicates
is changing,” said Albert Novak, a vice
chancellor in the Office of Institutional
Advancement, which oversees Tele-
Fund’s operations.

Starting Aug. 19, TeleFund’s student
callers were on paid leave following a
misunderstanding that led the students
to believe they were out of a job entirely.
The service, which raises funds for Pitt
through phone calls, has been suspend-
ed as Pitt considers how to adapt the
service’s operations to the current ways
by which people communicate.

TeleFund connected with more than

10,000 donors to raise more than $1.2
million in fiscal ‘year 2013, according
to Novak.

The misunderstanding among the
service’s employees occurred after
Christopher Bell, senior executive di-
rector of annual programs and commu-
nications for the Office of Institutional
Advancement, relayed the message that
the TeleFund calling service would be
temporarily suspended.

He said he was clear that the opera-
tion was suspended while the Office of
Institutional Advancement considers
new options, not that the student call-
ers were suspended.

But the following Monday, Novak
realized there had been a mistake in
the message relay. Comparing it to a

ponents, energy—efﬁcient lighting and
upgraded acoustics.

The large lecture rooms in David Law-
rence Hall were redesigned because of
requests from bothstudents and faculty,
and the changes have created a more
collaborative space. For example, the
development included new seating, al-
lowing chairs to turn a full circle to en-
able better discussions and interactions.

Construction.project_s over the sum-

mer also included extensive changes to

the William Pitt Union. ‘ _  e H

The Union’s Assembly Room, which
has held dance workshops, poster fairs
and lectures, was rebuilt extensively.
Ceilings, ﬂooring and the stage were
stripped and redesigned. Performances
that use the stage now have a host of op-
tions available to them, including vari-
ous lighting scenarios, digital projectors
and an improved sound system.

The renovations-have also affected

on-campus menu options.

August 26, 20i 8 | The Pitt News | vvvv\/v.pittnevvs.com

The Union is now home to a Taco
Bell as well as increased seating space.
An updated Quick Zone, now twice the
size ofits predecessor,‘ sits in the same
location beneath Towers. Additionally,
Market Central opened “Towers Treats,”
an ice cream and dessert booth.

While ice cream may be nice on lazy
afternoons, it’s not the ideal break-
fast food. The ﬁrst ﬂoor of Amos Hall,
which previously housed a fitness cen-
ter, will now instead be occupied by
the Oakland Bakery and Market. The
bakery won’t be a cafe for dining and
studying, but will accept dining dol-
lars j‘anc_l;1Panther'.Eunds for payment,
in additionltlo  and credit cards.
Fedele was unable to compile the costs
of the other construction projects that
tooklplace over the summer before the
time of publication.

the undergraduate education it provides, ‘

from theiresearch it produces, to the ex-

Nordenberg left the students with

three pieces of advice: take care of busi-
ness, take ﬁill advantage of thepwide range
of available opportunities and take good
care of yourself. ' _

A Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey
told students that they did not just choose

University also chose them. . V
“You wouldn’t.be here if we didn’t have
unwavering faith in you and your abilities.

We believe that all of you can and‘ will be

classroom,” she said. ‘ _ h -

Humphrey also encouraged the stu-
dents to experience all that Pitt has to
offer both inside and outside of the class-
room and listed the successes the‘ Univer-
sity’s graduates have achieved. She told
the students that their time on campus
will not only beneﬁt them intellectually,
but it will also expand the way they think
and help them develop as people.’

Humphrey told studentsthat in four U
years, their resumés would tell only part

of what they accomplished.

“But your character will be known by
many, and the actions you have taken will
tell the real story of the life that you have ’

tion, Student Affairs, is trying to have too
much of an inﬂuence on how students
volunteer,” said Pitt senior Mary Mal-
lampalli, who previously served as chair-
woman of Student Government Board’s
Community Outreach Committee and
as an early member of the Pitt Serves
Committee.

She said that volunteering is a very
personal experience for students and
that subjective participation draws stu-
dents to philanthropic causes of par-
ticular interest to them. That experience
then stays with them for the rest of their
lives. ,

“But when Student Affairs takes ad-
vantage‘ of having 17,000 able—bodied
young people  it defeats the purpose
of vo1unteerism,” she said.

Mallampalli expressed concern that
SCEC and Pitt Serves could streamline
the process to the point of depriving vol’-
unteerism of its true purpose, thus creat-
ing an environment in which students
are encouraged to en gage in community

outreach for the sake of resumé,-building

. or other artiﬁcial motivators not based

in philanthropic aims.

“The University shouldn’t be manu-
facturing anything,” she said.

But those who are part of the Pitt
Serves Committee and SCEC are very
conﬁdent in the initiatives’ potential
to change Pitt’s culture of volunteerism
for the better.

Formation

Pitt Serves, according to Vice Provost
and Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey,
came into existence a little more than a
year ago whenthe Ofﬁce of the Provost
asked the undergraduate deans to come
together and examine the undergradu-
ate experience in a holistic,way to re-
evaluate the total experience.

“Out of that meeting with the under-
graduate deans  many things came for-
ward as things that would be good to
enhance,” said Humphrey. “One concept
was the notion of how we provide service
to the community and to the region.”

This meeting kindled a desire for

.campuswide service that taites a more

concrete and centralized form and led
to the creation of Pitt Serves, which is

a subcommittee composed of faculty,
students and staff. _

In addition to Humphrey, members
of the Pitt ServesCommittee include
administrators from Studenfvolunteer

Outreach, the Ofﬁce of Community and.

Governmental Relations, the-Commu-
nity Outreach Partnership Center, the
University Honors College, the School
of Nursing, the Office of Cross Cultural

and Leadership Development, the School V

of Pharmacy and the School of Social
Work, among others. Mohamed is cur-
rently the only student on the Pitt Serves
Committee. b

“We all came together to talk about,
how dolwe enhance student service on
our campus?” Humphrey said. “And we
took this notion of Pitt Serves and said,
‘If we are going to enhance undergradu-
ate student service, what do we need to
doto create, enhance and take [service]
to another level?” ~ '

The committee outlined a number of
goals, including Pitt eventually appear-
ing on the President’s Higher Education
Community Service Honor Roll and the
Princeton Review’s list of top schools

for service. It also invested in software V

programs that track and account for the
overall economic impact on the region
made possible thanks to student service
and pointed to other institutions that
the-committee considers to be national
models. ’
“These universities approach civic
engagement with the same care as they
would their academic research,” Mo-
hamed said. ’
The committee’s exploratory sam-
pling took it not only to the University
of Pennsylvania, but also Indiana Uni-
versity, Purdue University and others.
“We took a very academic approach

to benchmarkingand researching who’s I

good at what they do,” said Tracy Soska,
the co—director and co-principal inves-
tigator of the University’s Community
Outreach Partnership Center and the
University’s Continuing Education Pro-
gram. . ,

leadership and governance. He said an
increased, Universitywide expansion of
amenities for volunteerism such as this
would be of benefit to Pitt students.
“You realize that other schools do
have solidiﬁed ofﬁces for service and a
more solidiﬁed presence on campus,”
Louderback said. “I think that we do a
great job, but with theamount of stu-
dents we have, we could do better. And
with this initiative, we could do better
and give back to our community a lot.”
But Mallampalli disagrees.
Incentivizing volunteerism

, She said she considers SCEC to be a '

“pseudo—student organization.” She feels
that Student Affairs isplucking out stu-
dents to take part in projects by offering
them too many.incentives.

“If people want to volunteer, they’ll
volunteer. It’s a personal thing, but we
shouldn’t necessarily be incentivizing
people by saying, ‘Oh, come here and
have some pizza, a free T_-shirt and some

OCC credit,” she said.

SCEC Co—Executive Director Mona
Kazour conﬁrmed that volunteer project
participants will receive OCC credit as
well food and transportation. She also
said she was certain some form of T-shirt

' will also be given out.

Kazour disagreed that OCC credit,
food, transportation and a free shirt
constitute “incentivizing” the projects
as a means of drawing in participants.
She said she has a different idea of what
it means to incentivize a project.

“I don’t feel like volunteering should
need an incentive,” Kazour said. “I’m not
going to pay you'to do service.” 1 .

Although Kazour saidshe won’t pay
students, all ‘of the SCEC committee
chairs received a stipend to help alle-
viate the cost of housing, as they were

_ mandated to spend their summer at Pitt

working on the program to prepare it
for its debut.

This stipend was designed to help the
chairs pay for their rent as they worked
on their respective committees and on
the volunteer group as a whogle. Accord-

Mallampalli feels that Pitt Serves and
SCEC represent a shift in the goals and
aims of Student Affairs, from which SCEC
will be based,
“I think Student Affairs’ values have

‘really changed over the past year from

‘Let’s do what’s best for students’ to ‘Let’s

‘ do what makes Pitt look the best.”’

Pitt Serves — and by extension, SCEC
—— looked to create an entity that would
work with all service—related student
organizations on campus to help them
as they work on their projects and to

. act as a liaison between organizations.
It also aims at being a means for these '

organizations to better communicate
with Student Affairs. V

Although SCEC’s mission is similar
to that of Student Volunteer Outreach in
many respects, the former organization
will absorb the latter. «

However, they_will operate out of an

“SVO will continue to have a direct

Director of Student Life and Associate
Dean of Students Kenyon Bonner. “SCEC
will be another component of that.”

Bonner said that while SCEC won’t
serve as the centralized unit of the for-

For The Pitt News

By the end of this academic year, Pitt
will utilize a $350,000 grant from the
National Science Foundation to expand
the Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology.
On Aug. 8, a ceremony at the labora-
tory’s location in Linesville, Pa., cel-
ebrated the coylmmepncejment of building,
construction. University funding will
also supplement the N SF grant to create
a lab facility estimated to cost $1.2 mil-

—. lion. The 3,600 square—foot addition is

expected to be completed by‘April 2014.-
The lab, run '

laboratory

PLE expects the new facility to at-

tract researchers worldwide. Though
speciﬁc projects for the lab are yet to
be determined, a new sterile lab area is
projected to be a hot spot for endeav-
ors in molecular and microbial biology.
There will also be an area for wildlife
study, specifically targeted at the study
ofpbirds. _ l  7

Pitt now offers 11 to 12 courses at

‘ PLE‘ as compared to'only seven or eight
in 2007. According to Relyea, students

have told him that the hands-on courses

reconsidered. But, he says, “until we get
to that point, it will continue to support
what it supports.”

An anonymous donor has been ﬁ-
nancing Pitt Serves and its pilot pro-
grams, but the groups hope to draw in
an endowment that can give them more
ﬂexibility to carry out their mission in
the future. And according to Soska, all of

the schools benchmarked have centers
named for their endowments.

“I believe we are making the kind of
impact that someone will want to endow
this center,” said Bonner. “I’m hoping,
I’m praying that someone will come
through for us and endow the work that
our students are doing.”

When asked if there was any fore-
seeable reason in her opinion as to why
SCEC’s budget wouldn’t be shared or
made public once it was later ﬁnalized,
Kazour responded, “Oh, not at all.”

The freshman orientation service
projects that were completed Aug. 23
were done in conjunction with SCEC.
But until the group can boast a more
solidiﬁed track record and well—known
presence on campus, some students’ re-
actions remain mixed.

“It is PR,” Mallampalli said. “And I
think that 90 percent of what Student Af-
fairs does is PR with activities like this.”

SGB membersowmya Sanapala said
that whether or not SCEC will be a useful

asset to student organizations “remains
to be seen, to be honest.”

She is interested to see how the re-
lationship will take shape because of
the overlap between already existing
volunteer groups. It will streamline the
way students interact with volunteering,
she thinks, and the way SGB works with
that, as well.

In order to increase its own efficiency,
SCEC is divided into six committees with
a different Pitt student serving as the
head of each. V

Sara Klein will serve as the director of
fundraising, Natalie Rothenberger as the
director of public and internal relations,
Bennett Garner as the director of educa-
tion service projects, Niaz Khan as the
director of health and wellness service
projects, Shivani Patel as the director
of community—based service projects
and Michael Beckman as the director of
environmental service projects.

Each of these positions will run a com-
mittee that allows interested students to
be involved in the Pitt Serves process.

“However, while I was creating the
committee structure, ’I realized that
there was no single, uniform model that
could work efficiently for each and every
committee individually,” said Mohamed.

Instead, each committee will be struc-
tured differently. H

Currently, those involved with the
project are uncertain whether SCEC
committee chairs will receive any sort
of ‘stipend or compensation for their

. work beyond the housing stipend they

already‘ received. _ .
Humphrey stated/that Pitt Serves will

make a program coordinator available to ’

student organizations that help to pro-
vide resources, and SCEC will work with
that program coordinator as a support
system for said student organization.
She saidthis setup is one the University
doeisn’t currently have.

Sanapala said she thinks the SCEC
could help groups with similar goals
work together effectively. But she also
said it’s possible that SCEC will risk hurt-
ing smaller groups because of the poten-
tial for redundancy in terms of projects.

To prevent this redundancy, she said,
SCEC should support smaller student

Peduto envisions rapid transit system in Pittsburgh  

Danielle Fox
Staﬁ’ Writer

Pittsburgh’s Democratic mayoral can-
didate is proposing a massive public
transit project, one that he says will
benefit Oakland and the city’s student
population.

Bill Peduto said his ideal model for
an expansion of Pittsburgh’s light rail,
commonly referred to as the “T,” would
connect most ofthe city through lines
that ran north, east, south and west,
which would cost several billion dollars.
But his proposal has drawn criticism
from his Republican opponent, former
state constable Josh Wander, who be-

lieves the city cannot afford the project p

and favors expanding transportation
through private enterprises.

Any actual decisions regarding pub-
lic transportation must be determined
by County Executive Richard Fitzger-
ald, who is proposing a similar plan
for light rail expansion highlighting
the development of a bus rapid transit
in Oakland, rather than the light rail
proposed by Peduto.

Peduto, the city’s District 8 coun— ”

cilman, said- if he is elected to office,
he plans to establish a light rail line
that connects with the‘ existing system
Downtown. As part of the expansion,
Peduto is envisioning a light rail line
that would go through the North Side
neighborhoods to Cranberry Township,
which is about 20 miles north of Down-

town. Another new light rail line would '

travel through the West End neighbor-
hoods to the Pittsburgh International
Airport, which is about 20 miles west
of Downtown. He would also build a
rail line that would run along the East
Busway to Monroeville, which is about
15 miles east of Downtown along that
route. . - ~

.Bu‘t Peduto’s rival opposes this vision
to extend the light rail.

Against a ‘government Santa Claus’

Republican candidate Josh Wander
said it would be “particularly cruel” to
the region’s young people to pretend
such a project was possible singe neither

the state nor federal government could
afford to fund the multibillion-dollar
project. In his assessment, members
of the generation currently attending
college or entering the workforce would
have to forfeit some of their incomes in
order to pay for this project.

“Unlike my opponent I have no in-
tention of attempting to fool the fine
residents of our city into believing that
there really is a government Santa Claus
and that this government Santa Claus
plans to shower billions of dollars on
Pittsburgh,” Wander said. ,

Oakland are limited.”

Currently, a parking pass for Pitt
parking lots costs between $386 and
$340 for commuter students, and
between $736 and $680 for resident
students. Since Pitt currently has an
agreement with Port Authority of _Al-
legheny County, the agency handling
public transportation in the city and its
surrounding areas, that allows students
to utilize the company’s services with-
out paying fare, students may be able
to ride the proposed light rail for free.

Port Authority spokesman Jim

“We need to expand our transit
network because transit is the
lifeblood of our city.” ’

Bill Peduto

But Peduto insists that expand-
ing light rail transit would stimulate
growth. '

“We need to expand our transit net-
work because transit is the lifeblood of
our city,” Peduto_ said in an email. “We
can’t increase the number of j obs in our
city if the people who need them can’t
get to them and there’s no way we can
build enough parking to allow every
person to drive to work.”

One of Peduto’s target areas is the
neighborhood Pitt calls ‘home. Oakland
is home of the three of the largest em-
ployers in Pittsburgh—UPMC Health
System, Pitt and Carnegie'Mellon—

which bring a ‘heavy flow of traffic to

the area. Peduto said his plan would
reduce traffic congestion, lessen the
need for cars for students and provide
a good investment for the universities.

Rebecca Belan, former president
of the Commuter Student,Association
said, “Light railwould be helpful, for
students, particularly from the South
Hills, where transit ways into the city/

Ritchie said 5,276,481 riders used a Pitt .

I.D. to ride the organization’s buses and

V rails for the 2013 ﬁscal year, between

July 1, 2012 and June 30 of this year. .
Laying new tracks

The Port Authority of Allegheny ‘ I

County currently operates a 26.2-
mile light rail, or “T”, that runs along
North Shore and Downtown Pittsburgh
through the southern part of the‘ city.
Port Authority spokeswoman Heather
Pharo said in an email that more than
27,000 ridersuse the transit service on
an average weekday.

In 2012, the Port Authority complet-

_ ed its most recent expansion to the light

rail, a 1.2—mile extension that connects
Downtown with the North Shore that
cost $517 million.

Pharo said the addition increased

rail ridership by an average of 18.2

percent. .

L _ Mark Magalotti, a Pitt senior lec-
turer on transportation engineering,
said extending Pittsburgh’s light_ rail
further is a feasible idea and would be

the best option in ‘expanding public
transit.

“By going underground [with light
rail], you are going to create quicker
service, and you aren’t going to have
traffic congestion on the street,” Maga-
lotti said. . V,

The primary way the éxpansion’s
design plan is being studied includes
the light rail operating underground
from downtown to_ Oakland. '

Light rail operating underground
was the preferred option in the East-
ern Corridor Transit Study Transitional
Analysis to Locally Preferred Alterna-
tives (ECTS-TA), which aimed to look

for ways to efﬁciently expand transit. .

It was sponsored by the Southwestern
Pennsylvania Commission (SPC), the
Westmoreland County Transit Author-
ity (WCTA), Allegheny County and the
Pennsylvania Department of Trans-
portation.

“You don’t want to put the light rail
vehicle on the street because it’s going
to‘ cause a lot of traffic on Forbes and
Fifth Avenue,” Magalotti said.

Research projects have ‘proven that
additional light rail in Pittsburgh would
be feasible for decades, but Magalotti
said high costs have prevented proj-
ects from ensuing. He estimated that it
would cost between $800 million and
$1'billion to develop light rail‘ transit
from Downtown to Oakland.

Peduto estimated that his entire
proposal would cost several billion
dollars and would take up to ten years
to complete necessary planning and
construction.

» “However, that doesn’t mean it’s
not possible and it doesn’t ‘mean we
can’t push to get parts of it done sooner
rather than later,” he added. ,

In order to fund his public transit
project, Peduto said in an email that
he would try to use proglramssuch as
the state-level Redevelopment Assis-
tance Capital Program and the federal
Transportation Investment Generating
Economic Recovery, both grant pro-

grams intended to stimulate economic
growth, in conjunction with private
investments.

Jay Pagni, a spokesman for the Penn-

, sylvania Office of the Budget, said that

it was possible that the RACP could
grant funding for certain aspects of the
light—rail project, depending on how
speciﬁcally Peduto said he would use
the grant money. “ ‘

“It really would depend upon what
the plan would look like once it was
submitted,” Pagni said.

Eligibility for RACP is evaluated
based on criteria that include the proj-
ect’s potential ﬁnancial and community

’ impacts and the number of jobs it is

expected to create.

According to the U.S. Department
of Transportationwebsite, TIGER is a
t-hree—tie_red program that is based on
the extent of a project. Congress al-
located $1.5 billion for TIGER 1, $600
million for TIGER II, $526.944 million

grants to fund projects that have a

signiﬁcant effect on the nation, a re-

gion or an urban area. Figures for 2013
weren’t available.

The website stated that grants “fund
projects that have a signiﬁcant impact
on the Nation, a region.or a metropoli-
tan area.”' p

The Department of Transportation
was unavailable for further comment.‘

Amie Downs, a ‘spokeswoman for
the ofﬁce of County Executive Rich
Fitzgerald, said in an email that the
mayor does not have formal authority
over the Port Authority, an agency of
the county government. Any decisions
would have to be made by the county
executive and conﬁrmed by the county
councﬂ.

A Downs said that although County
Executive Richard Fitzgerald’s would
like to expand existing light rail ser-
vice, his plans do not completely align
with Peduto’s. ,

Fitzgerald would like to see a light
rail line that goes north toward Cran-
berry or west toward the ‘airport.

“In a perfect world, we would obvi-
ously love to see light rail in the Oak-
land/Downtown corridor,” said Downs.
“But realistically, in order to see some-
thing done soon, it would have to be
bus rapid transit.” I

Bus rapid transit is a mass transit
system that operates mainly in a seg-
regated lane and features bus stations
with off board fare collecting and el-
evated boarding platforms.

In April, Pittsburgh was selected
as one of four cities to receive part of
a $1.2 million grant from The Rock-
efeller Foundation to develop bus rapid
transit. The foundation awarded the
money to the public affairs firm, Global
Strategy Group who is partnering with
Bravo Group, a Pittsburgh public advo-
cacy ﬁrm to support research and raise
awareness about the need for BRT and
its probable success in Pittsburgh.

Kim Whetsell, account executive
at Bravo Group, Inc., said Pittsburgh
was chosen to receive grant funding
because the Allegheny County Port
Authority’s transit development plan
proposed a BRT system that would con-

nect Downtown to Oakland and because
of the efforts being made by Get There
PGH, an organization comprised of30
Pittsburgh institutions, including Pitt,
that is calling for new bus rapid transit
systems.

“There is great potential for eco-
nomic development opportunities
within the proposed route for imple-
menting BRT,” she said.

Although Port Authority has plans in

‘motion to extend public transit through

bus rapid transit, Wander said he would
try to solve problems with public trans-
portation through private enterprise
to “end the Port Authority’s monopoly
status in the region and empower other
providers.”

Furfding additions to the public
transit system, Wander said, would
force the ‘local government to cut so-
cial programs. A

Carbon emissions increase alongside
American skepticism  

Nick Voutsinos

Columnist
Long before the industrial rev-
olution, carbon was recycled
naturally through the transfer-
encelbetween the Earth, oceans
and the atmosphere. This cycle
is life—sustaining, yet if humans
keep pushing this pattern to
its limit, carbon will soon no
longer be able to recycle itself
naturally.

And this will inevitably hap-
pen unless we immediately start
to. hold ourselves accountable
for the exacerbation of global
climate change and begin to
seriously reconsider how we
use energy. However, there is
serious doubt that humans are
part of the problem, which of
course is slowing down any
real action to reduce carbon

errfissions. Until we recognize
the consequences our actions
have created, the environmen-
tal harm will soon reach a point
of no return.

For now, the natural carbon
cycle continues to suit human
needs, but the environment is
starting to lose its ability to
keep up with human activities,
thus vastly altering it. The
biosphere, which typically is
responsible for absorbing car-

bon before it rises up to the

atmosphere, has dramatically
shrunk in size due to the growth
of citiesand the decimation of
forests. As carbon emissions
increase and the sizes of forests
. decrease, the less effective the

biosphere will be at absorbing“

carbon. In fact, if trends con-
tinue, it will no longer be able

‘to sustain any more carbon at

all. According to BBC News,
European forests are actually
reaching a “saturation point” in
which a great number of trees
will no longer be able to absorb
carbon.

This is evidently another
sign that our carbon footprint
is getting much larger. Yet,
despite the signs, cumula-
tive global action has not yet
been-taken to seriously reduce
emissions. Though the United
Nations has made. anveffort
through the Kyoto Protocol,
the protocol is only as strong
as its participants —- and, of
course, the countries emitting
the most carbon have nothing
to do with this effort. ’

Coincidentally, these same

Pittsburgh home to
host of hidden happy
hour spots

Sophia Al Rasheed
C0Zum72z's2f

While most other students spent their
summers going on vacations, earning
money or getting into shape, I spent
most of mine trying to mask the pain
of an unpaid internship and standard-
ized testing. In short: I went to a lot of
happy hours. .

I quickly found that although my
favorite Oakland happy hour loc_ations
were ideal for my income (which was
nonexistent), they became a bit boring.
When we live in such an accessible, enjoy-
able city, there is little reason to stick to
habit. If you do some research on places
to go in the city, you can surprisingly
enjoy it on a budget. Below you’ll find my
favorite places I’ve found in Pittsburgh
— they get the seal of approval from a
woman who really, really appreciates
good food and drinks. These aren’t loca-
tions for binge drinking and borderline
forgetting that the night happened, but
they allow you to actually enjoy the city
while you take some stress—relief time.
Best of all, you can enjoy these places
with about $10 in your pocket.

Wine Night at Up. in Shadyside '

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, this
classy lounge has a half—off wine bottle

special, making it a perfect place to share 3

a bottle with a few friends, whether it’s
to ‘end a long day of work or get an early

start to the weekend. For those people V

who know their wine, the selection will
have you quickly returning. For my fellow
wine noobs, the staff is very knowledge-
able about the subject and eager to help
you find something you enjoy. I

Mad Mex in various locations

If you’re on a gluten—free or vegan diet,
this placeis not for you. For those who
enjoy good wings and beer, this place

is heavenly. Half-off drafts and half—off.

wings guarantee you’ll be happy this hour

(from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m,/ on weekdays).
."For tequila lovers, you probably already
know their “big azz margaritas” are half
off as well — although I can’t guarantee
you’ll accomplish a lot with the rest of
the night if you start it this way.
Emi_liano’s in the South Side

This.is' a nice switch from Mad Mex

if you’re looking for a similar selection
of food and drink. From 4 to 6 p.m. on
‘weekdays, they have half—off appetizers
(sorry guacamole fanatics, this isn’t in-
cluded), half-off house margaritas and
half- off drafts in addition to a daily spe-
cial. The quality of the food and drinks is

something to see for yourself. The service A

is great, they know how to mix tequila
and it’s a nice break from the less—classy
cocktails we typically ﬁt into our budget.
The Porch at Schenley in Oakland
The Porch deﬁnitely isn’t the cheap-
est place in Oakland. However, if you are
going to spend $10 during unwinding
time, I recommend sitting outside and

V ordering a drink. Cocktailsat The Porch

are arguably the best cocktails you‘ can
find around ‘Oakland. Happy hour drink

specials are 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. and pizza is

half-priced after 9:30 p.m. on weekdays.
Plus, if Pittsburgh weather allows you to
sit outside, cherish every second.
. Rock and roll bingo in Tiki Lounge
‘in South Side _ '
This isn’t necessarily a happy hour,
but who wouldn’t want a chance to win
prizes while out on the town? On Tues-
days, games are free to play, and you can
win free drinks, gift cards and other fun
prizes. This is the perfect medium for
people who enjoy doing an activity other
than dancing while drinking. _

countries happen to have the largest
economies, directly in line with the
mindset that being environmentally
friendly is not exactly business—friendly
— at least if you’re trying to_ attract the
investments ofvwealthy oil companies.
And unfortunately, the United States
happens to be a prime example of this
thought process in action. In fact, most
of its population remains skeptical that
the burning of fossil fuels is even caus-
ing any serious environmental damage
at all, despite the signs in Europeand
elsewhere. This skepticism is growing
rapidly: In 2007, 71 percent_of Ameri-
cans believed that the burning of fossil
fuels exacerbates climate change. In
2009, it dropped to 51 percent, and by
2011, the number of Americans who
believed this was down to 44 percent.
This is a very steep ‘decline in an
amazingly short amount of time and is
most likely correlated with the vast pro-
paganda campaign funded by various oil

tycoons across the United States. From
2002 to 2010, these wealthy individuals
have secretly funneled about $120 mil-
lion to groups whose main goals were
to spark doubt in the scientific data
behind fossil fuel’s involvement with

burning of fossil fuels. Despite this con-
sensus among scientists, the corporate

world continues to deny their claims in

order to maximize its own short-term
proﬁts and power by fiercely lobbying
against any environmental regulations.

fuel subsidizer. And along with the huge
tax breaks oil companies receive from
the U.S. (up to. $4.4 billion every year),
traditional energy isn’t going anywhere
for a long time. ‘

Unsurprisingly, these trends have led
the U.S. to be the second-most-polluting
country in the world, emitting 5,492,170
metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2010
— right behind China. So even though
the U.S. represents only 4.5 percent of
the world’s total population, it’s burning
enough fossil fuels to make up for the
entire developed world.

That being the case, unless the U.S.
starts to change its attitude and reduce
its carbon emissions, chief economist
for the International Energy Agency
Fatih Birol warns that “we will end up
beyond what scientists tell us is the min-
imum. The door will be closed forever.”
We see the effects of carbon emissions
now with European forests and rising
sea levels, but the longer America waits
to regulate its emissions, the more dra-
matic the consequences will be in the
long term. I

I every Pittsburgher should see. It follows

the title as interestingly as you could

are reasonably priced).

This summer I’Ve done both reward-

exploring the city of Pittsburgh. It is cru-

work and play simply for sanity reasons.
These places that I’ve frequented add to
the overall attractions Pittsburgh has to

August 26, 2518 I The Pitt News | vvvvvv.pittnevvs.com V 29 '

Students must take advantage of

community Nordenberg Hall promotes

. Rohith Palli
Columnist

The wait is over: Walking from Soldiers 8:
Sailors Memorial Hall to the Litchﬁeld Tow-
ers no longer requires going around Thac-
keray Hall or back to the intersection of Fifth
Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard. More impor-
tantly, Mark A. Nordenberg Hall is complete.
Nordenberg Hall is the new building at the
corner of Fifth and Thackeray avenues. It is a
modern,'dormitory-style freshman housing
facility with wireless Internet and air condi-
tioning, among many other amenities. The
building is designed with a lot of great fea-
tures — a great location, sustainable design,
indoor bike storage (ﬁnally!) and alayout that
emphasizes community. But it has potentially
fatal drawbacks, as well — a huge cost and
unnecessary TVs in every dorm space.

One of the most impressive features is
the building’s environmental focus that will
likely guarantee it LEED silver certiﬁcation.
‘LEED certiﬁcation requires both that a build-
ing meet a certain set of rigid standards
and also that it score a certain amount of
points in aﬂexible scoring system that rates
buildings out of 100 points with six bonus
points available. The standards include a 20
percent reduction in water use and storage
and collection of recyclables. Categories in
the points system include on—site renew-
able energy and use of recycled materials
for construction. .

In this system, a rating between 50 and

59 points will confer a silver certiﬁcation. '

The expectation of a silver certiﬁcation indi-
cates that Pitt could have. done better, but it
is nonetheless an achievement. Though Pitt
may have some measures to take in becoming
a truly green campus — such as not overheat—
ing buildings and watering grass during the
day —- this is a huge step in the right direc-
tion. Hopefully the Pitt administration will
keep environmental priorities in mind during
ﬁxture construction projects.

More importantly, there is an emphasis
placed on community in the layout of the
building. A plethora of evidence exists that
students perform better when they have a
sense of belonging. Dean of Students Kathy
Humphrey told the Post- Gazette that reten-

tion rates between freshman and sophomore

_ year are higher for students who feel they are

part of a community and that these students
generally have more success at Pitt. Hence,
fostering dorm-based communities in the
right ways should be the priority when de-
signing a new dormitory. -

But the layout of the architecture isn’t
the only thing that contributes to creating a
community. Senior Mark Tumblin, aformer
RA, said, “From what I’ve seen, the most
important factor in having a good ﬂoor com-
munity is the personalities of those on the
ﬂoor and how well they get along  I think
it’s more helpﬁil to view communal space

as just a bundle of potential, as opposed to A

always thinking of a lounge as a bonus.” It
doesn’t just matter whether the space exists:
It has to be used properly.

The televisions in each room, in addition
to costing lots of money, will likely work
against the purpose of creating community.

5 There is no doubt that some students
mightwatch TVtogether and use it as a jump-
ing—off point for building connections, but
others will do just the opposite and sit in their
own rooms watching their own televisions.
Critically, even the students who are able
to build connections would have done just
as well with TVs in common areas instead
of hidden away in dorm rooms. Though it
seems like a modern, smart thing to do, these
TVs stand as the result of a major blunder.
Regardless, with the right RAs and students,
a community will ﬂourish.

With the wrong students, Nordenberg
Hall may just turn out to be an overhyped,
expensive hotel. The University spent $59
million on construction. This means that Pitt
spent almost 24 percent above the national
average of $5,900 per student — a total of
$9.13 million more than the average school
would have spent for a dormitory holding
the same number of students. For that much
money, the Dietrich School of Arts and Sci-
ences could bestow 56 full—tuition scholar-
ships each year for the next ten years.

It is up to the group at Nordenberg Hall
to take advantage of their edge in housing,
deny the pull of their anti-social ﬂatscreens
and create avibrant community. I

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

When it came to addressing some of the
questions surrounding this year’s Panthers
football team, head coach Paul Chryst
found a number of answers during train-
ing camp. \

Tom Savage won the starting quarter-
back job, and Tyler Boydworked his way up
the depth chart and will start opposite red-
shirt senior Devin Street at wide receiver
for the Sept. 2 game against Florida State.

While Chryst searched for answers, both
new and old faces vaulted their way into
contention for playing time in the offensive
and defensive backﬁelds.

James Conner

Conner originally received a scholarship

to Pitt after a standout performance as a *

defensive .end at a recruiting camp held
by the Panthers a few years ago, but he
will now start at running back against FSU.

Conner began playing the position in .

his senior year of high school at McDowell
High, and he ran 155 times for 1,680 yards

and 21 touchdowns as he led his squad to‘

the quarterﬁnals of the PIAA Class AAAA
playoffs.

Even still, Conner isbstill learning as he
continues to “earn the right to more reps,”
in the words of Chryst.

“He’s learning,” Chryst said. “Mistakes
aren’t necessarily bad, because you can
learn from them.” V '

' That learning experience included three
weeks of practice against a defense that
ﬁgures to be one of the toughest in the ACC
this season. In the meantime, Conner is
focused on the little things as he lines up
across the likes of Aaron Donald and oth-
ers in practices. .

“I know our defensive line so well, so
the big runs aren’t really happening right
now,” Conner said. “I know they’ll happen
during game time, but right now I’m just

The Panthers look for depth at receiver and tight end, among other spots, by shuffling player posiions. Bobby Mizi |Visual Editor

Position switches help fill holes onPanthers roster

paying attention to details and working to
build my conﬁdence up.”
Jaymar Parrish _

_ While Conner starts-at halfback, his
fullback may not be redshirt junior Mark
Giubilato but freshmanjaymar Parrish," in-
stead. Parrish, out of Gateway High School,

, was the No. 25—ranked prospect in Penn-

sylvania and continued to earn more reps

with the prohibitive ﬁrst team as camp .

progressed. _

' Parrish came out of Gateway as a tight
end and linebacker and led his team in
tackles while he averaged 19.2 yards per
catch. Parrish’s hybrid skill set now places
him in contention to not only play fullback
but to offer versatility out of the backﬁeld
as an H-back.

For now though, Parrish is doing “most-
lyfullback things” as he works to make
himself a presence on the ﬁeld. Multiple
practices saw the,6-foot—2, 230-pounder
wreaking havoc against physically over-

 

matched cornerbacks and safeties in 11-

’ on-11 rushing drills.

And with roles at the fullback and H-
back positions, Parrish has taken the learn-
ing curve in stride.

“The coaches try to keep it simple for
us,” Parrish said. “They keep it in a context
where we can understand the plays and get
the feel of everything.”

Barn Bradley

Pitt’s defense has little room for new?“

comers, as it returns 10 of 12 starters from
a unit that ﬁnished in the nation’s top 20 in
yards allowed per game in 2012. But so far,
Bam Bradley has made a case for himself

to start at one of the linebacker positions_._*

“We hope he’s starting to realize his
potential,” Chryst said. “I thought he was
doing some good stuff early in training
camp, and now he’s got to get back in the

Camp L> 4%“

Possible wild card playoff
means modified game plan

Francisco Liriano has been the staff ace throughout the season. MCT Campus '

Tyler Pecyna
Assistant Sports Edzfor

A lackluster August for the Pirates, who have

‘ played .500 baseball forthe month, has tight-

ened the National League Central standings.

While the Pirates play through their dol-
drums, the third-place Cincinnati Reds have
caught ﬁre, posting a 14-7 record through 21
games in August and moving to within 2.5
games of the division lead.

St. Louis, tied with Pittsburgh atop the
standings, has sustained its winning pace by
going 14-9 for the month.

In other words, it may be_time to start

, adjusting posbseasonpredictions. No, I’m

not implying the Pirates are going to collapse
and fall out of the race altogether. All I am
suggesting is that the team should prepare
forthe worst playoffscenario: battling in th
do—or—die single play—in game. “

A one—game series requires high—risk,
high—reward strategies — a blueprint that
takes no consideration of the future and places
all emphasis on the single game at hand. In
other words, each inning should capitalize
on every player’s strengths, every platoon
advantage. So who then toes the rubberforthe
Pirates as the starting pitcher, should they ﬁnd
themselves in the wild card playoff?

The answer is too obvious: The starter is

the most effective pitcher, the guy who most
frequently hurls that little white sphere and
misses the stick of wood his opponent swings.

Based on a single statistic, there are actu-
ally two pitchers who would suffice for the
team —Jason Grilli and Francisco Liriano.
And the statistic to determineas much is con-
tact rate —— the self-explanatory metric that
indicates how frequently a pitcher throws
the baseball andthe batter swings and does
not whiff.

The less the ball is batted into play, the less
damage can be done.

Accordingto Fan_Graphs, Grilli has limited
hitters to a 69.5 percent contact rate. Hitters
have swung and hit Liriano 69.8 percent of the
time. For reference ofhow dominant these two
have been, consider how the league average-
contact rate hovers around 80 percent on -a
yearly basis.

It’s dangerous business, gauging aplayer’s
worth with one stat, but it’s also dangerous
business deciding the outcome of a season
in a single game in the first place.

I should point out that FanGraphs writer
Dave Cameron suggested a similar strategy for

» the Braves before last years one—game playoff,
- recommendingthey use closer Craig Kimbrel

to start. In2012, Kimbrel posted a 61.1 percent

  Panthers shut out Dukes in

SGHSOI1 opener

Tyler Pecyna E
Assiszfant Sports Editor

The Pitt women’s soccer team began
its 2013 season with a 1-0 victory over
Duquesne on Sunday —-— the lone goal
tallied by sophomore midﬁelder Roosa
Arvas;

Arvas put the Panthers (1-0) ahead of
the host Dukes (1-1) in the 43rd minute
with her goal, a 25-yard shot and score
assisted by senior forward Dana Delle-
Femine. In the 83rd minute, Arvas nearly
doubled the’ Panthers’ lead when she ﬁred
a shot that caromed off the crossbar.

Junior goalie Nicole D’Agostino record-
ed ﬁve saves en route to blanking the op-
ponents for her fourth career shutout. Pitt
head coach Greg Miller praised D’Agostino
and the other defenders — seniors Caro-
line Keefer and Morgan Sharick and junior

Jackie Poucel — for their work in the back,
but saw room for improvement.

“They all did a great job of putting out
ﬁres,” Miller said after the game in a press
release. “We could have done a better job
of not putting them in a position to make
those plays, but they did a fantastic. job
of disrupting Duquesne’s ability to try to
sneak ‘one in on us.” -

Duquesne outshout Pitt on the‘ day,
15-12, though both squads managed ﬁve
shots on target. I

Three of Pitt’s shots were taken by for-
ward Carly Seneca, one of four freshmen to
start in the Panther lineup, before she left
in the 41st minute with a right-knee injury.
Midﬁelders Ella Vanhanen and Siobhan
McDonough and defender Kaila Jenkins
also got the nod as ﬁrst—year players in

Freshman recruit
Chapman dismissed _
from Pitt football team

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Former four-star quarterback
recruit Tra’Von Chapman will
not return to the Pitt football
team, as announced Friday
morning by Pitt head coach Paul
Chryst.

“We believe it is in everyone’s
best interests that Tra’Von pur-
sue his academic and athletic
careers at another institution,”
Chryst said. “We wish him the
best.” .

Chapman had been under
disciplinary suspension since
April 30 as a result of charges
stemming from an alleged as-

sault involving Chapman and his
then—girlfriend. Chapman later
pleaded guilty to the charges and
served a three-day jail sentence.
Chapman had been at Pitt
since the spring after graduating
early from Theodore Roosevelt
High School in Kent, Ohio, in or-
der to enroll early at Pitt as well
as participate in spring practice.
Chapman entered Pitt as a four-
star recruit at the quarterback
position, and the No. 12 overall
quarterback in the Class of-2013.
Over the summer, Chapman
did not attend classes at Pitt,
nor did he participate in Pitt’s
training camp, which took place
during the past few weeks. E

NCAA grants Randall
hmmaﬁmedmﬂﬁmwl
C after transfer

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt transfer Derrick Randall
has been granted immediate
eligibility after his waiver was

- granted by the NCAA, as re-

ported by Mike DeCourcy of
Sporting News. 

Randall, who transferred
to Pitt from Rutgers’ basket-
ball program, requested the
waiver after Rutgers ﬁred for-
mer basketball coach, Mike
Rice, in relation to allegations
of player abuse by Rice.

Randall transferred to Pitt
in June, and will now provide
immediate depth in a front-

court that lost centers Steven
Adams and Dante Taylor to
the NBA Draft and graduation,
respectively.

As a freshman, Randall av-
eragedjust 2.1 points and 1.5
rebounds per game as a Scar-
let Knight and came off the
bench to play just 8.2 minutes
per game. _ -

The 6—foot-8, 240-pound
forward from Brooklyn, N.Y.,
‘should see time on the ﬂoor

his transition to center and
freshman Mike Young makes

swing of things.”

Bradley, a redshirt freshman,
came out of Trotwood—Madison
High School in Dayton, Ohio, as a
defensive back who racked up 60
tackles with ﬁve interceptions‘ as
he led his team to a 15-0 season

that culminated with a state title. I

Now, two years later, Brad-
ley is playing linebacker and ran
with the. ﬁrst team later in train-
ing camp. But that’s not to say the
path had no obstacles as he tran-
sitioned from safety to linebacker.

“It was harder than I thought —

it was going to be,” Bradley said.
“I’m used to having everything
in front of me playing safety, but
now I have to turn around and

look behind me, so it’s a bit of a

change-up.”
Bradley took full advantage of
the opportunity offered to him

I when Todd Thomas temporarily

I left the Pitt football team during '

training camp.. But he isn’t yet sat-
isﬁed, despite increased reps with
players who most certainly will
line up against the Seminoles on
their ﬁrst offensive series of 2013.

“Even though I’m out there, I
feel like my spot isn’t solidiﬁed,”
Bradley said. “I don’t want to get
caught up in being with the ﬁrst
team because those older guys,
they’re seasoned veterans and
even their spots aren’t locked up.”
‘ Anthony Gonzalez

Three years and three posi-
tions after Gonzalez came to Pitt
as Pennsylvania’s No. 7-overall
player in the Class of 2010, it
seems Gonzalez has found a home
as one of Chryst’s starting outside
linebackers. It’s a home in which
Gonzalez feels he belongs.

“I feel real good here and am
playing really well,” Gonzalez
said. “The coaches have told me
I’ve been playing well, and obvi-
ously there’s room for improve-
ment, so every day I just have to

41-

keep getting better.”

Gonzalez played in nine games
in2o12, made astart atthe strong-
side linebacker slot in the BBVA
Compass Bowl and recorded ﬁve
tackles against Ole Miss. Gonzalez
started the season as a safety -—
the position he played at Liberty
High School — but he moved to

linebacker when injuries wreaked -

havoc on the Panther linebacking
corps.

“We’re happy with him,” .

Chryst said. “He’s got a pretty
good football sense and football
IQ. Combining that with getting

comfortable at a spot, hopefully

he keeps growing there.”

Now, it looks like Gonzalez

may enter the season at the top
of the depth chart at the Sam line-
backer slot guided by a simple, yet
effective, focus.

“Whenever you have to make
a play, make it,” Gonzalez said.
“Put yourself in a position to make
plays, and also put other people in
a position tomake plays.” I "

contact rate — the lowest rate in 2012.
Cameron then explained that Atlanta
would be better off using the rest of its bull-
pen and even starters based on platoon splits.
Finally, Cameron argued, Kris Medlen would
come in for the ﬁnal three innings or so. In
2012, Medlen got his chance to pitch in the
starting rotation on]uly 31 and proceeded to
allow no more than three runs in any start.
In other words, Cameron‘ said the Braves

     

   se 

The similarity between the 20_12,Braves'
and die 2013 Pirates is that both bullpens
dominated, recording some of the best statsin
the National League. One of those numbers is
winprobability added (WPA), a counting met—.
ric that factors how a player’s — or, group of

to the likelihood of winning the game.

Over the entire 2012 season, the Braves
had a 7.14 WPA. Stated simply, the relievers
added about seven wins to Atlanta’s record.
In 33 fewer games, the Pirates’ 2013 bullpen
has posted a WPA over 10.

But while the 2012 version of Medlen and
the current version of Liriano have compa-
rable numbers, the former had pitched pre-
dominantly from the pen the same season.
The latter has not done so consistently since
2006. /

So what we’re looking at is a better bullpen
and a premier option to start the game for
the 2013 Bucs.

Give Liriano the start and let him go three
innings. In the ﬁrst three innings, Liriano
has held opponents to a .574 on-base plus
slugging percentage. In the fourth through
sixth innings, batters have an OPS over 80
percentage points higher.

sponded in the 65th minute when senior
defenseman Patrick Soltys redirected
an opposing player’s shot past Panthers
keeper Dan Lynd.

After a Detroit header hit the bottom
of the crossbar, the Panthers were able
to counter and take the lead. Off a set
piece, senior forward Ryan McKenzie
perfectly connected with junior forward
Chu Chu Onyeukwu for the Panthers’
second goal of the match.

Detroit got desperate following Pitt’s
goal, refusing to quit. With just 6:19 left
to play, Titan freshman midﬁelder Aid-
an Kuhls found fellow freshman Adam
Clauss, who directed a shot across the
box and past Lynd. The tying goal stood,
as the two teams played to a 2-2 draw.

Following the game, Luxbacher was
not pleased with his team’s effort down
the stretch. A

“When you’re up 2-1 late in the game,
you want to be really safe. But we took
some risks, and they caught us,” he said.

Pitt 2, McMaster 0

On Sunday, the Panthers played a
complete game at Urbanic Field. The
turnovers were eradicated and the Pan-
thers dominated play.

“We played much better soccer to-
day,” Luxbacher said. “We didn’t create
as many chances as we would have liked,
but we hadva lot of the ball.”

And while the Panthers may not have
had a lot of chances, they capitalized
when possible to tally two goals.

In the 11th minute, Onyeukwu took a

   

feed from Wrobel, and fired a strike into

the back of the net. The goal marked the

second day that Onyeukwu has scored.

The Panthers continuedto dominate
the ball through the rest of the first half,
as they held on to the slim 1-0 margin.

The Panthers picked up ball pressure
to start the second half, and it would
lead to a few more chances, one of which
resulted in a goal.

In the 70th minute, junior midfield-‘

er Dan Prete corralled a loose ball and
scored Pitt’s second goal of the game.
The Panthers held on for the rest of the
game, concluding the team’s exhibition

 

 

season.

The three games were a success for
the team, as the Panthers played every
single member ofthe roster in hopes of
seasoning young players.

“This weekend was about getting
guys experience,” senior defenderjohn
Cordier said. “Looking forward, this is
going to prove to be invaluable. It was
important to see which guys can step
up for us when it counts.”

So, as the season approaches, the Pan-
thers feel extremely confident looking

every time she scored.” .

Most of the chances to celebrate, how-
ever, were in practices rather than games.
Arvas ﬁnished with just three goals in 19
matches, but she did rack up eight assists
— so the team adapted to allow for “2
Chainz” to remain a ﬁxture on the ﬁeld.

The moniker now serves to identify
one of the Panthers’ set pieces, a dead-

ball opportunity to set up an offensive at-
tack or maintain possession. With either
approach, Arvas is the maestro sure to
orchestrate the process.

This could be rattling, being relied
upon to serve a cross from the corner and
ﬁnd a teammate’s head or drive a ball on
goal from 20 or 30 yards out.

But Arvas, who stands at 5-foot—8 with
fair skin and light blond hair, does not
feel the pressure, which is perhaps why
she answers so cooly when asked what
deﬁnes her ability to pinpoint free kicks.

“I don’t know,” she said nonchalantly
with a soft-spoken Finnish accent. “My
technical skills are so good that I can put
the ball [in the] same place every time.”

Arvas said she has always been the one
to take set pieces since she was young,_
thriving on the exposure to carve out a
niche on the ﬁeld. Such conﬁdence has
resonated with her teammates. '

“Her free kicks are awesome. They’re
always spot-on,” Keefersaid. “I’m never
nervous when Roosa has to go take free
kicks. I always get this feeling that some-

thing good is going to happen whenever
she has those [opportunities].”

Though the Kuopio, Finland, native
has carried one aspect of her game across
nations, she is quick to admit to having
sought on—ﬁeld adjustments after ﬁrst
tasting the NCAA style of play. 2

“The American way [of playing soccer]
is so much faster and more physical than
Finnish soccer,” Arvas said. “It was a chal-
lenge at ﬁrst to adapt, but now I think I’m
playing faster and getting more physical.”

The accolades prove her smooth tran-
sition: Last year Arvas earned Fourth-
Team All-American honors, was named
Big East Women’s Soccer Rookie of the
Week on Aug. 27, led Pitt with 14 points
and ﬁnished third in the Big East in as-
sists. ’ .

Of course, Arvas said she came to Pitts-
burgh —— more than 4,200 miles from her
home in Kuopio — to experience how
other countries play soccer, make the nec-
essary modiﬁcations to her game and bet-
ter prepare for a future in the sport after
college. But even the up-tempo, grinding
play Arvas encountered on the ﬁeld was
not as much of an obstacle as having to
communicate in a new language on a daily
basis. Though she has studied English
since third grade, she said the curriculum
she encountered focused mostly on gram-

. mar, with few opportunities to speak the

foreign language outside of class.

So when she returned to Kuopio -for the
summer after her freshman year, Arvas
was relieved to speak Finnish and con-
tinue competing on the ﬁeld.

She returns with a regained conﬁdence
that had at times been lost during her
ﬁrst experience stateside. And now that

ARVAS

Pitt has moved to the ACC, the toughest
college soccer conference, success comes
at a premium and any morale boostsare
needed.

Freshman forward and midﬁelder Ella
Vanhanen is one of those boosts, a fel-
low Kuopio native, former teammate and
longtime friend of Arvas.

Vanhanen remembers the ﬁrst time
she met Arvas, her voice perking up to
describe the scene.

“The ﬁrst time I saw Roosa she was
shooting, scoring on the goal,” she said. “I
was looking, like, ‘She can shoot!’”

The two have high expectations in re-
joining forces for the season, with Van-
hanen citing Arvas’ ability to connect
on passes in the wide spaces of the ﬁeld.
They’ll feed off each other — Arvas as
part—mentor, part-maestro —— upping the
Panthers chemistry.

But does one year and one player really
make that much of a difference? Is Arvas
ready to again leave behind her love of
ruisleipa (a Finnish take on rye bread) and
saunas (considered a necessity to Finns)
to face a foreign language and staggering
ACC opponents?

Just ask Keefer.

“Now that [Arvas] is back, she’s deﬁ-
nitely a lot better [with English] ,” she said.
“It’s so much easier to have conversations
with her -— she’s picked up on sarcasm
and jokes around [the team] a lot more.
She’s in better shape this year than she was
last year. Her transition this season has
been a lot better than it was last season
already — and we’re only two weeks in
[to practice].” I

By this point, the Pirates would hopeto
have taken a signiﬁcant lead on their oppo-

nents or at least be inaclose game. If the latter
is the case, go with Cameron’s advice and play
the platoon matchups: lefties Justin Wilson
and Tony Watson face right—handed bat-
ters while righty hurlers Vin Mazzaro, Jared
Hughes and Bryan Morris face lefty hitters.

Should the game be a blowout in their fa-
vor, the Pirates have long-relieverjeanmar
Gomez to pitch up to ﬁve innings — his lon-
gest outing in 2013.

The Braves went the traditional route in
their wild card play-in against the Cardinals.
They started Medlen, who allowed ﬁve runs

— two earned — in six and one—third innings
and sent in their dominant relievers after-
wards. But it was too late for them to protect
any type of lead, resulting in a 6-3 loss and
the end of their season.

The alternative pitching plan seems con-
voluted. But, considering the fact that the 162
games preceding the wild card playoff are
irrelevant, game theory should not be boiled
down too simply.

Of course, the easy alternative is to win

the division, but as always with the Pirates,
it’s best to just prepare for the worst. I

Be smart, safe, and don’t
jeopardize your future.
