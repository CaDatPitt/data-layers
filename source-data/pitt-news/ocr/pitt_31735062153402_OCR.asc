Oxygen. I V I 11
Comingi  a distincttrelielffrom the
common impression that European’
-scientists have had a ‘close monopoly
on all original work, Pitt students. are
pleased to remember that the manwho
made themost important discovery in
tho.Vhis.tory of chemistry was at resi-
dent of Pennsylvania and is buried
within the boundaries of this state.
Dr. Francis ‘C. Phillips, of the,Schoo1,
of Chemistry, recently -viVsited.*th.e

‘ home of this famous man at Northum-I

berland, Pa., and -has prepared for
readers of the Pitt Weekly the fol-
lowing‘ account of thefamous ;man’s
work: ‘_  V‘ ‘V  -
_‘fAs_studen{ts -of chemistry we are

[told that the discovery of oxygen and

of the part ‘played by it in combustion
was made by Sclieele
., “After this -meager’ statement", the
textbooks wander off into the details
"of the science’ . and it is -not, until

‘much laterjin the student’s — course.

thatlthis discovery begins to be recog-
7nized as thepgreat turning point in
the history of chemistry; that before
athe’ discovery of‘, oxygen -scientific
chemistry had no real existence; that
no single discovery in latter V tyimes
A done“ more for the adv ce “
discovery, so profou «.3 achange wa
wrought in chemical theory that these
two investigators and many of their.
-contemporaries were unable to realize
‘its. full signiﬁcance, and thecomplete
interpretation only followedlater. at
the hands. of the ‘French philosopher
Lavoisier.” . .  1. ~ »

“In the history of chemistry no
chapter is of greater interest -to
‘chemists than that relating to the
«work of Priestley and Scheele, and
fortunately the early literature of the
science gives ’us much of detail as to
the character of their work and as_to
the lives and personalities of these
famous investigators.  p
, “Joseph Priestley was ‘an Englisﬁ
clergyman of scholarly attainments,

who, as a Unitarian, was classed as a-

dissenter from“ the »doctri:_nes of the
‘Church of England. His [spare mo-
ments he devoted to the ‘study of ex-
perimental chemistry and more par-
ticularly to the ‘investigation of gases.
He contributed many article-s to the
scientiﬁc journals of the time and pub-
‘lished numerous works upon religion,
in most of which the defense of Uni-
tarianism was the theme.”. .
“Priestley found that the air con-
tained in a bell jar over water, vitiate-d
either by the burning of a. candle or
‘by the breathing *0-_f a small animal,
‘may,-again-»become fitted for the sup-
'port of life“ or combustion by adding
to it the_ gas obtained by heating red
oxide of mercury, or by the gas from
plants ‘growing in -water; that the’ air
vitiated in either way owes its prop-
erties to a gaseous body, identical with
that evolved _by. the action of oil of
vitrol upon marble. . He used the

commit ourselves. Neither the right

But we believe that the best c"ourseTLfor

at least, Lwhatever the ethics of its
conduct, acted with -commendable
speed and decision. Those are good-
qualities for .a governing body to have,
and we were~TgladL to .see them Lcome
out. The mix-up brought to light sev-
eral important oLbstac1fefs to the future
success» of student .gove_-rnment, which
the Senate is re1sponsibLlLe fer solving,
and which-concern the relation of the
studen_Lts,ofL the professional schools to

this game, it can take little» away from
his credit in turning out the team he
has after losing so many of his last
year’s stars. - L 
The style of play ofthe two elev-
ens is almost entirely different. Pitt
depends almost entirely on its terriﬁc
off-tackle and end plays, and with the
interference working with the clock-
like precision that it has displayed in
seine of the games this year, it will be
difficult to" stop. Opposed to this type
of action is the tactics "employed by
the Washingtonians. ~ With a backﬁeld-
that isnotably weak in line plunging.
they have been compelled to resort to
aerial tactics and it has been along
these lines that their coaches have
been «drilling them.

Weakness against this line of‘ attack
was shown last Saturday against Al-
Llegheny, bu-t——-the game this Saturday
is another proposition. _
- Pitt will enter the game with letter
men ﬁlling every position. Fry, Has;

a tings, DeHart and Williamson compose

a backﬁeld that has few peer-s,in the
country today. Both on the offensive
and the defensive this quartet of back-
ﬁeld stars display a'\b/rand of football
that could hardly be improved. , The
Pitt line today is Without doubt ‘th

strongest that ever represented‘ 01

Uni. Peek at center outclasses any
other passes in collegiat ranks. His
playing has been one of the features
of every game played by his team this
year. Both Eastern and. Western
critics are hailing “Bob” as the great-
est man at his position. Soppitt and
Sutherland, the Blue and Gold’s two
giant guards, have outplayed every
‘pair of guards they have met this
year. Thornhill and Hockensmith, at
tackles, are two of the men whom
“Joe” Duff coached and both are put-
ting up a brand ofball that is ﬂatter-
ing ‘as to Duff’s ability; to coach the
line_Lmen. Holding down. the wings
are Herron and Carlson, with Sies,
the new man from the west coming
strong. “Pat’? and “Red” are able
successors of the capable ends that
have played on the University teams

7 in the last decade. "Their playing, al-

the not of the sensational nature, has
been steady and effective. For fur-
ther. info as to their ability inquire
of Spiegel of last year’s W. and J.-
team, who considered them two of the
best ends he had evergplayed against.

The Red and Black team will enter
the game with a number of new men
t.aking' the‘ places of the’ men who
‘represented the college team for the
last two or three‘ years. Wesbecker,

Several -of the newspaper scribes
were fanning between halves of the
game Saturday and the consistent

work of ‘‘Ted’’ Frry was remarked. One ‘

of. the older of the critics held’ that
he was the greatest fullback that ever
wore-the Blue and Gold with the pos-
sible exception of “Tex” Richards.
Fry’s work this year, taken game af-
ter game, has been one of the chief
factors of the team’s success. One
line of play that he does not get cre-
dit due him is in running interfer-
ence for his backﬁeld mates. At this
line of. play he is a close second to _L

Students March to Memorial Hall
Headed by Student Band to
Participate in Exercises.

The Elizabeth Steel Magee Hospit-
al was dedicated last Wednesday, the
exercises being held in Memorial Hall
at eleven o’c1ock. Lead by the stud-
ent band, the academic procession of
students and faculty marched to -the
Soldiers’ Memorial hall, where learned
men paid tribute ‘to Elizabeth Steel
Magee and her eminent son, Christo-
pher Lyman Magee.

The Right Rev. C-ortlandt Whitehead
of the Pittsburgh Diocese, Protestant
Episcopal Church, gave the invocation,
and .M¢I‘. Self the president of the
‘board of trustees of the hospital pre-
sided. i x :

Dr. Jones, the first speaker address-
ed the assemblage, using as his sub-
ject, “Christopher Lyman Magee and
His Gift.”  -

“The hospital is more than a mem-
orial of marble and granite,” said Dr.
Jones, “This memorial will live long
after memorials of stone have crum-
bled away because it was given out
of the kindness of a man who loved
his fellow men.

“It will be an undying witness of
thenobility and kindness of this man-
It will express the gratitude of him.
No man was better known than Mr.
Magee and he was loved by all who
knew him. . _I

“He was a man of great -kindness
of heart and his kindness was inborn.

“In his heart of hearts he cherished

the name and.memory of his mother .

and it was his love for her and for wo-
mankind that -caused him to erect the
hospital.”

Dr. Ziegler,’ the medicaldirector of
the Magee Hospital, spoke of the
plans that have been made for the
management of the hospital.

“The best thing that can ever» be
said of Christopher Lyman.Magee is
that he loved his mother,” said Dr.
Ziegler.’ “In her name he has given
all that he possessed for the cause of
humanity. As a" result, the Elizabeth
Steel Magee hospital will ever be re-
garded as a monument» to Mr.~Magee
and a memorial to his‘ mother. Be-
cause of the nature of the work which
the hospital will do itbecomes more
than this. In no other way could the
double purpose which Mr. Magee had
in mind been so effectively accomplish-
ed.

“The ﬁrst and last thought will be
for the best interests of its patients,
and, whether they be ‘rich or poor, its
aim will be to give them the best that
modern medicine aﬁords and for what

institution i-t will send the gospel of
good obstetrics far and wide through
the physicians and nurses trained
within its walls, and will be the
means. of providing competent ob-
stetric care for thousands of women
who_wi1l never see the hospital and
who will be reached in no other way.

“In contemplation of the generosity

and sympathy,‘ the goodness of heart-

and the wisdom of Mr. Magee we
have a true and imperishable image

of a man. Well may we join in say- I

ing of him as was said of the Noblest
Roman of them all. ‘His, life was
gentle and the elements so mixed in
him that nature might stand up and_
say to the world——,-this was a man.”’

Chancellor McCormick then address”-
ed the assembly on the subject of the
“Magee Hospital and Medical Educa-
tion.” A

Dr. Mc-Cormick said, “The Magee
hospital was founded by one who car-
ed profoundly for motherhood and
whose thought went out to the
mothers of the land. It has every
facility the most modern science and
skill could devise, in order to bring
as nearly as possible to perfection
the skill essential to health in the

child. \ — 1
- “Such an institution has before it a
future of usefulness far beyond the
capacity of the most vivid I imagina-
tion to depict. As a teaching insti-
tution and in making‘it such the wis-
dom of the trustees is most sincere-
ly to be commended-—it will turn out
sessed of knowledge and skill ‘com-
mensurate with the high service they
are to render to the nation.’’.

The conclusion of the exercises was
marked by the conferring of the hon-
orary degrees of doctor of laws by
Chancellor McCormick upon Dr. John
W. Williams, dean of the Johns Hop-

tubes carrying lo-oped iron wires, 
ilar -to modern explosion pipettes, for
mixtures andi
oth_er apparatus far in advance of his}
time were in constant use. He made
analyses of atmospheric air and show-
ed that besides the portion, which sus-
-tains life there is a residue which,:
although not directly poisonous,,can-
not support life or ﬂame.

“But while Priest1ey’s fame’ as a
scientist was spreading, his preaching
of Unitarianism brought him more
and more into disfavor with the clergy
and with the populace and in 1791 his
house in Birmingham was sacked’ by a
mob of fanatics and burned to the
ground, entailing the loss of his lib-
rary and lab-oratory apparatus. After

cided, in 1794, to migrate to America,
where he planned to join avparty of
English colonists, who aimed to settle
u_p0I1 a tract of three hundred thou-
sand acres of forest land in North-
umberland County, Pennsylvania, but
as the colonizing plan was abandon-,
ed, he built a house at the town of‘
Northumberland, facing one of the
great branches of the Susquehanna
River.

“Priestley remained a persistent de-
"fender of the phlogistic theory
throughout his life an.d while he -still
carried on laboratory experiments in
his new home he continued to write
upon theological subjects and’ strove
from time to time to recall the French

chemists -to the belief in phlogiston. ‘

“He died of heart aﬁection in 1804.
“On July 31st, 1874, many of the
chemists of the United States and
Canada gathered together in North-
umberland where, standing at the
grave of Joseph J . Priestley, memorial

hundred years before, and on the same
date a monument to Joseph Priestley
was unveiled in Birmingham, England,
the place in which he had been so
cruelly illtreated as the victim of mob
violence m-ore than a century ago. I
“Priestley’s home in Northumber-
land still stands, facing the broad and
beautiful river and the mountains
‘just beyond. It was indeed a fasci-
nating experience. to me to stand re-
cently in that old laboratory and fancy
the famous experimenter at work up-
on oxygen, and a great pleasure to
meet, some of his descendants, the
Misses Jean B. and Annie S. Priestley
great-great grand-daughters of the
Rev. Dr. Joseph Priestley, known for
their good-works far beyond the lim-
its of the quaint old town of North-
umberland and who so worthily repre-
sent the name -of the great master,

ALL INDUSTRIES" .

 

DEPEND ON SCIENCE 

Forcefully pointing out the absolute
dependence of industry upon science
for its improved methods of produc-
tion, Dr. F. R. Bacon, director of Mel-
lon Institute, spoke last Friday ev -
ing before the Allegheny Coun

ley Hotel. - , ,
Manufacturing is rapidly becoming a
system of exact scientiﬁc processes.
In describing this close relation be-
tween science and industry, Dr. Bacon!
said: r .
“Manufacturing operations, whether
physical or chemical, must be based
upon research’ if they are to be car-
ried out with success; in fact, the in-
dustrial proﬁtableness of today is de-
rived from efficiency in production,
and this eﬂiciency has resulted from
the work of the industrial researcher,
the scientist who devoted his time to
perfecting manufacturing processes
and equipment as well‘ as investigates
the problems which are created» by
every development in manufacturing.
The investigatory work in mnaufac-
turing is largely of a chemical na-
ture, and -accordingly industrialists

have learned in recent years to rec».

ognize chemistry as their pathﬁnder
and intelligence bureau. Ten thou-
sand chemists are now engaged in
pursuits which affect more than
1,000,000 wage-earners ‘and produce
more than $5,000,000,00.0 worth of
manufactured products each year.
“The formation of the Naval Advis-
ory Board by Secretary Daniels is
distinctly an oﬂicial recognition of

of ‘‘Bull'' Durham than in a" pound of any other
