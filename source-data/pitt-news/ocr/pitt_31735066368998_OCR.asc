SGB Assembly Urges
Progromh Reforms

By SUE McFARLAND
. Pitt News Staffwriter

The Pitt Union Program Council
and its policy onebooking concerts
came under fire at yesterday’s
bi-annual Student Government

Board assembly meeting.
The controversy began when SGB
member Jan Medoff submitted a
proposal to the assembly, which
/consists of representatives of every
recognized student organization on

campus. Medoff’s proposal called D

for alteration of the present
Program Council contract between
the SGB and the Ofﬁce of Student
Activities, which states that all
concerts must be done “under the
auspices of a promoter.” '
Medoff asked that the contract be
severed, allowing the Program
Council the option of staging
concerts under the direction of a
professional promoter or, as had

man. and comes from an excellent’-

family,” Sherrill stated. A -

Sherrill conﬁrmed that Delaney".s
version of the incident this
weekend is different from the
report on the incident.

“I ‘haven’t talked to the
policeman,” Sherrill said. “I read
the report and I listened to Lindsay.
There are conflicting reports.”

According to police, a friend of
Delaney’s—Keith Waldron—tried
to enter Lothrop Hall Saturday
night. without any identiﬁcation
while carrying some beer. When
he refused to leave the building,
Waldron was arrested. by Pitt
Police.

It CcirterUnveils Voluntary Wage, Price Guides

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON — President
Carter unveiled a largely voluntary

new set of wage and‘ price

guidelines last night andpleaded
with the nation “to give this plan a‘
chance‘ to work.” ’

* “We must face a time of national’
austerity,” Carter said in remarks
prepared for a speech broadcast to
the nation. ’ “Hard choices are
_necessary- if we want ‘to avoid
consequences that are even worse”

he said. The president,‘speaking‘

from the White House Oval Ofﬁce,
set a guideline of 7 percent in 1979

forlincreases in wages andfringe
beneﬁts and‘ a complex price
guideline aimed at holding increas-
es to approximately 5.75 percent
next year. _

Carter said that if the program is
‘successful this would translate into‘
an inﬂation rate of 6 per cent to 6.5
percent in the next year, well below
the current rate of about 8 percent.‘

He said he would ask Congress
to enact tax rebates for workers
who comply 5with the 7 percent
wage guide and ‘who would suffer
when inﬂation exceeds that level.
Carter called it “real wage

insurance. ’ ’

As part of his new assault on
inﬂation, which the president said
would be his administration’s' No. 1

domestic priority in the coming‘

year, Carter pledged:
-To cut the federal deﬁcit to $30
billion or less next year.

-To fill onlyone of every two new .

job vacancies in the government for
“an indeﬁnite period.” a

-To ”oppose any ‘further reduct-
ion in federal income taxes until we

have convincing’ ‘prospects that A

inﬂation will be controlled.”

-To seek legislation ‘bringing

increased competition in the
railroad and ‘trucking ‘industries.
Earlier yesterday, Carter signed
into law a measure that will phase
out federal regulation of air fares.
Carter said the federal Council
on Wage and ‘Price Stability, which
presently has _a staff of about 30

persons,’ will get 100 additional‘

employees and will “monitor” all
collective bargaining ‘contracts and
the pricesof the top 400 firms in
the nation, those with annual sales
of more than $500 million. ' ‘
.“These standards are fair,”
Carter said. “They are standards
that everyone ‘can follow. If we do
follow them, they will slow prices
down——‘so that wages will not have
to chase prices to stay even.” 1
Carter said that cutting‘ the
federal deﬁcit. and foregoing future
federal income tax cuts would

require “national” austerity” and‘

“hard choices.” ~ _

_ “I intendto make those hard
choices,’.’ Carter said, adding ‘that
he would continue to veto spending
measures if necessary to “keep
our nation ﬁrmly on the path of
ﬁscal restraint.” Carter said his
limits on federal hiring would mean

a reduction of more than 20,000 in ‘

the number of permanent federal
employees budgeted for this year.
However, .a rider attached to the
recently enacted civil service
revision bills requires Carter to out
the federal workforce by about
30,000 to 40,000 persons.‘

Carter appealed to potential
critics of his anti-‘inﬂation program
to give it ‘careful study before
attacking ‘it. ' _ '

, “These proposals, which give us

a chance, also deserve a chance,"
he said. “If, tomorrow, or next
week, or next month, you ridicule
them, ignore them, pick them apart
before'they have a chance to work,
you will -have reduced their chance
of succeeding.”

Carter said his program can
work, given’ time, but won’t
produce any ‘immediate, dramatic
cut in the inﬂation rate.

“If there is one thing ‘that I am
askiriggof every American tonight,
it is to give this plan‘ a chance to
work—a chance to work for us,”
the president said.‘

Initial reaction from members of
Congress was generally support-

' ive. Sen. Jacob K. Javits,-R-N;Y.,

said after being ‘briefed by Carter,
“I think as a ﬁrst step it ;will get
considerable Republican support
because it’s doing something.”
Rep. Robert Giamo, D-Conn.‘,‘said
“I believe it’s a very real ﬁrst step
to get things under control.”
However, Senate Minority
Leader Howard Baker of Tennessee
and House Republican Leader John
Rhodes of Arizona ‘signed a
telegram sent to the presidents‘ of
the commercial networks demand-
ingequal time to respondto the
president’s anti-‘inﬂation speech.

Then-President ‘Richard Nixon, r

usingauthority that a Democratic
controlled Congress forced on him
over his own objections,‘ imposed
mandatory wage and price controls
in 1971 when inﬂation was running
at about 6 percent a year. The rate
dropped to 3.4 percent in 1971 and
1972, but shot up to 8.8 percent in
1975 after controls were lifted, and
12.2 percent the following year.

California Voters Decide Anti-GoyReferenclurn

By The Associated Press
SAN FRANCISCO—-The decade
that carried homosexuality from
whispers and scholarly studies to

' loud national debate reaches a

‘on a question

milestone next month with the ﬁrst
statewide vote on rights of
homosexuals. 1 _

On Nov. 7, when Californians
decide Proposition 6, they will vote
stated against
homosexuals’ rights. The proposal
would require school boards to fire
or refuse to hire any teacher judged
unﬁt because of public homosex-
uality or advocacy of homosexual-
ity.

Critics say the proposed law
would clamp a tight lid on teachers’
rights to speak out in support of

_ civil rights for homosexuals, in or



33’

out of the classroom. Advocates
say such rights are outweighed by
those of parents.

- Latest public opinion polls
indicate the vote will be close. The
initiative is one of the most

emotion-charged on the ballot.

Coming nearly 10 years after a
New York City bar riot signaled the
beginning of the gay rights
movement, Proposition 0 will be
the ﬁrst statewide test of public
sentiment on a right rebuffed by
voters in several cities recently-that
of homosexuals to jobs.

On one side is a conservative
state senator, John Briggs, who
appeared with singer Anita Bryant

in Miami, Fla., in 1977 to lead the
ﬁrst widely publicized repeal of gay

rights ordinance. He returned with
an evangelical vow of all-out war
against homosexuals.

On the other side, arguing that
current law can deal with improper
classroom behavior and that Briggs
is trampling human rights, stand
most major elected state ofﬁcials, a
dozen school boards, leading clergy
and a staunch conservative, former
Gov._ Ronald Reagan. '

Briggs concedes he came up with
the homosexual issue to boosthis

Moraiarboard Advice
Helps Undergrods‘

By J. J. SCOTTMAN

When choosing classes becomes
so frustrating you’re ready to
add-drop your life, there are fellow
students who may be able to help.‘

Members of the senior honorary,
Mortarboard, have started a stu-
dentadviser service to supplement
the University’s advising system.

“Any student who wants advice
on courses, professors ' or the
registration process. in general can
call or see us at 31.1 Schenley Hall,”
explained David Tepper, Mortar-
board president.

The service, which was created

with the support of the Inter-.

Honorary Council willpublish a list
of advisers names, phone numbers,
majors and career objectives, he
said.

Tepper added, “If a student
wants to ﬁnd out about Economics
15, for example, he. can ‘call
someone on the list with an
economics major to obtain informa-
tion.”

The advising will be aimed at
helping primarily freshmen and
sophomore students in the College
of Arts and Sciences, "he said.
Eventually he would like to include
student advisers from the other

‘- schools so the service would be open

to every student. »_

Fred Koloc, administrative spec-
ialist for -the CAS advising center
said “the idea of peer counseling is
great.” ‘

“We spend a lot time training our

advisers on the various areas of
distribution,” he said, “but the
largest weakness of the advising
process is that no adviser can ever
know what every course is like.”
_ According to Koloc, the service
was experimented with during the
past year, through freshmen
orientation.

“We gave the advisers a list of
Mortarboard members and their
majors. If the student wanted
another student’s perspective, the
adviser was supposed to pass on the
information,” he said.

One CAS adviser, Debbie Lips-
cher, said although the service has
potential, she hasn’t been suggest-
ing it to her students.

“I usually give them names of
other (faculty) advisers in speciﬁc
areas, such as health related
professions,” she said.

“They (students) have problems
contacting professors and advisers.
Freshmen, especially, tend to get
overwhelmed by the vastness of the
University. Calling‘ a stranger

the professors and courses.”

might be difficult,” Lipscher
added.

Tepper explained that the
addresses of the student advisers
will be available for students who

“feel less anxiety about writing their

questions._

“In the future, if students have
enough interest, we will maintain a
centralized office where a student
can stop to speak to the adviser in
person,” he said. “We eventually
would like to establish a ﬁle on all

candidacy for the Republican
gubernatorial nomination. He
trailed badly in the polls and
dropped out before the June
primary.

However, he garnered 500,000
signatures on petitions to qualify
the initiative on the November
ballot. »

“It’s the hottest social issue
since Reconstruct-ion,” he said.

, Harvey Milk, a member of the
San Francisco Board of Supervisors
and self-professed homosexual,
has debated Briggs on the
proposition and charges the sena-
tor is just using the issue.

“At ﬁrst I thought he was
sincere. But having ‘met him three
different times in debates, I realize
he is lying in his teeth on the issues
and he knows it,” Milk said. “He
comes from the same school of
politics that Hitler did—'playing on
people’s fears.”

. Opponents of the initiative have

ads and in many areas provided
speakers to various groups. Milk
notes that in selected areas like San
Francisco, “where gays feel more
secure,” there is a door-to-door
effort. I

The campaign against the
initiative, spearheaded by diver-
gent groups of homosexual rights
activists, has _recruited broad
support. .

The California Federation of
Teachers, other unions, most major
newspapers and civil rights leaders
argue that it is unnecessary, was
proposed to pamper Briggs’ ego
and is a threat to constitutional
rights.

only, ‘‘I think the laws we have on

When speciﬁcally asked for his I 0;

 How hiring you can cost somebody $45,300

93,0()0,000 Americans now hold jobs. But that won‘t mean
much when you look for a job, yourself. You’ll have tough
competition. You’re among 17,000,000 more Americans

4 looking for work over -the next ten years; That's how many

new jobs America must create, including yours.

It‘s going,to cost a lot of money. Before you get a dime of
salary, whoever hires you will have to buy tools, office
space, factory equipment and buildings—the things it takes
to let you do your job. The average cost to companies is now
$45,300 for each job.

We don’t mean you can’t be hireduntil your employer
finds exactly $45,300. You might walk-into an existing job.
But don’t count on it. Not with 17,000,000’ competitors.
Some companies can hire you for less than $45,300. But
others—heavy industry, for instance——.need much more. At
Armco, our cost is now $57,520 a job. " '

That money must come from whatever a company has

profits. A company might borrow against
future profits to make you at job. But still‘,
profits pay for jobs because that’s the
only source companies have.

If you asked your friends how much the
average U.S. company clears in profits on
each dollar of sales, chances are many of
them would guess 25¢ or more. The truth
is 5¢ or less. That’s not much to put to
work to make new jobs. ~

any skeletons in his closet, they
certainly would have been exposed
by now, and his opponent is holed
up inside a high school classroom
dissecting frogs, not issues.”

The lieutenant governor candi-
dates have become a highly
scrutinized duo in Pennsylvania’s
gubernatorial race. The 31-year-old
Scranton, -a political novice, owes
his identity to his father—a former -
governor, reluctant presidential
candidate, United Nations ambass-
ador and Republican idol.

Democratic candidate Robert P.
Casey owes his success to a man he
has never met. A biology teacher at
Allegheny County’s Taylor-Allder-
dice high school who has been
campaigning part time, Casey has
the identical name of the popular
former state auditor general who
ran unsuccessfully for governor.

Republicans have tried to goad
Casey into the fray, hoping to
capitalize on an apparent weakness.
Gubernatorial candidate Peter F.

  

TAI-El  

Flaherty has tried to defuse the
controversy by pointing the ﬁnger
at Scranton.

‘ ‘I read Scranton’s brochure. He
says he published three newspapers
that his daddy gave him, and none
of them made it. And for six years
he searched the world to find
himself in transcendental medita-
tion. I think we have to weigh a few
of these things, ’ ’ Flaherty counters.

The younger Scranton has
undergone quite a metamorphisis
since graduating from Yale in 1969,
settling into what he calls a
comfortable niche.

Gone are the, pony tail from his .

shoulder lengthhair and the blue

A Needed
Change for
i Programming

/

Ina meeting more like a three-ring circus than an
‘organized Student Government Board Assembly,
bﬁard member Jan Medoff yesterday presented a
motion to amend the Pitt Union Program Council
by-laws to allow the council to schedule concerts
without using a promoter. As the contract now
stands, the program council must use a promoter to
schedule any concerts.

During her defense of the current system, council
Chairwoman Tammy Haddad cited the success of the
Chuck Mangione concert as proof that using a

promoter does work. Any time Haddad hears talk of .

trying to schedule concerts without a promoter, she
recites a rapid-fire list of reasonsxwhy independent
concert scheduling can’t work. She mentions the dif-
ficulty of getting a concert hall; the possibility of last-
minute cancellations; the risk of losing money, and

reasons why the program council shouldn’t schedule

concerts without using a promoter. .
Though her points seem valid, Haddad forgets to

council’s record is not unblemished in its attempt to
schedule concerts. The program council failed in its
attempts to schedule a concert for Black Week in
November. Its record is not a,glowing 1-0, but a
rather lackluster 1-1. This glaring failure to schedule
a concert is especially embarrassing since the coun-

cil’s charter specifically calls for it to give special .

consideration to programming for minorities. If the
program council could have had the option of
schedj ling a concert without the use of a promoter,
they might have been able to arrange some concert
successfully. Without that alternative, the council
managed only to buildvresentment and
ween the council and BAS. r

The Black Action ‘Society can even smirk, “I told

you so,” in_ the face of the council’s failure to

schedule any Black Week concert through a
promoter. The society originally opposed the
provision that required concerts to be scheduled
through promoters, and its fears now seem to be fully
justified. Black Action Society ‘had successfully
scheduled concerts without using any promoters in
the past, and the first try to arrange a concert for
them through a promoter turned .into a complete
flop. V 4 »

In the face of this grievous blunder, Medoff’s
proposal seemsmore than essential. ‘The clause
requiring use of a promoter too tightly ties the hands
of the program council when it tries to arrange con-

hostility bet-_

remove the_strait jacket the promoter requirement
now places on the program council. Medoff himself
states the advantage of his suggestion most aptly.
“The option should be there for student groups to do

their own programming, go-.through a promoter or A

i subsidize student tickets. The more options there

are, the better PUPC can serve students. ”

The motion still allows the council to use
promoters if it wishes; there is no radical change in
the program council’s methods. Medoff’s proposal
expands the alternatives the program council can use,
so Haddad and her council members should be glad
they have more ways to schedule concerts. -

As Haddad stresses, using no promoter presents
certain risks, but those risks are necessary ‘if the
program council is to be able to present concerts to
satisfy all students in all cases. As Medoff puts it,
“Sure it’s a risk, but everything’s a risk.” ' .

A BY PATTY TASCARELLA

‘ This fall's lineup of new
television‘ shows is further evidence
of both the lack of imagination in
network executives and the deter-
iorating taste of the American
public.« ~ ‘

Perhaps it is unfair to claim the
tastes of the viewers has gone
downhill. After all, for every
“Dallas” or “Taxi” of this season,
there were vast audiences who
tuned in regularly to catch the
of “Ozzie and
Harriet.” And on the‘plus.side,
even landmark comedies of the
past such as “Your Show of
Shows” have been surpassed in the
depth of satire by “Saturday Night
Live.”

Television shows themselves are

A no worse than in past years—the

problem lies in the addition of sex,
vulgarity and cheap spin-offs to
capture an audience.

as

C

The man most responsible for
these trends is Fred Silverman,
currentxprogramming head of NBC.
Silverman was lured away from
ABCthis summer by a consider-
ably higher salary. He made ABC
first in the Nielsens ‘by buying
several sex-oriented shows such as
“Charlie’s Angels” and
Boat.” He also created a-winner in
“Happy Days” and recycled it
successfully as spinoffs—-“Laveme
and 4 Shirley” and this year’s
comedy hit, “Mork and Mindy.”

“Shows like ‘Fantasy Island’ are
mind candy,” Producer Aaron
Spelling, creator of that show once
euphemized. ‘The logical after-
thought, that mind candy hastens
decay of the brain, is left unspoken.

Silverman’s new campaign at
NBC is taking a sideways twist-
the new shows included “Who’s
Watching the Kids?” (about Las
Vegas showgirls) and “Waverly’s
Wonder" (Joe Namath ‘as the male
sex symbol, already cancelled), but
sex was not given the focus it had

Get the Facts Straight

, I am writing in response to the
column “Camp David’s Lack of
Palestinians,” written ‘by John
Hess. It seems Mr. Hess has his
facts confused.

Mr. Hess speaks of, “. . .the
Middle East wars that have been
waged for the last 30 years . . . in
response to Israeli expansionism.. .
.” No Middle East war to date has
been a result of expansionism on
the part of Israel. Wars of the past
30 years have been the result of
Arab expansionism, counteracted
by Israeli defense. This was the

_case in 1948, 1956, 1967 and'1973.

Also, Mr. Hess claims that the
Zionists ran the Palestinians off
their land -to set up their own
settlements. If Mr. Hess had done
any research at all, he would be
quite ‘aware that any land used by
the Zionists for settlement between

1935 and 1947_ was payed for,-or

\ allocated to the Jewish Agency by».

the British government.‘ (Has Mr.
Hess ever heard “of the. Balfour
Declaration ‘of 1917?) .Official
records also will show that the

little extras thei

Jewish Government ‘appealed to 

the Palestinians to remain ‘in
Palestine and help develop the
new state. '

One final‘ error made by Mr.
Hess was in callingthe PLO the
accepted representatives of the
Palestinian people. Statistics will
show the vast majority of Palestin-
ian people reject the PLO com-
pletely and condemn their violent
actions.

I hope in the future, The Pitt
News editorialists will take the time
to research their editorial materials
before writing. I was very
disappointed to find such a lack of
‘correct fact in a high quality
newspaper such as The Pitt News.

,_ 1, weanesainnosiober   

This letter is a response to Cris
Hoel’s column-at-large, which
appeared in the Oct. 18 issue of The
Pitt News, “Little Information
Breeds Rumours in Lothrop Hall.”
While. Mr. Hoel recognized the
dangerous mixture of “fear,
imagination, and lack of informa-
tion,” he also points to another
fundamental inconsistency that
repeatedly has arisen at this
University, not recognizing a need
before it becomes a catastrophe.

From personal research of past
Student Government elections, ‘I
have come across a presidential
candidate whose platform empha-
sizes, among other things, the need
for increased dorm security. The
election was held two years ago, and,
sadly, the _candidate was defeated.
Upon reviewing campaign plat-

forms of candidates in this past
election, no presidential candidate
even mentioned the need for dorm
security and only one board
candidate addressed the issue of
“campus crime.” Needless to say,
this candidate was also unsuccessful
(at this point, it is much too late to
apologize for my own neglect of such
an important facet of campus life.
Hopefully, someone will learn from
my mistakes). Only now, when the
lack of residence hall security has
resulted in the rape of two Pitt
females in less than one month, is
responsible action being taken. If
you’ll pardon the cliche, ‘it’s almost
like closing the barn door after the
horse has escaped. '

Mr. Hoel also points to perhaps a
considerably more. important issue,
which I believe i_s'not entirely unique

to security (or lack of it) in Lothrop
Hall. Mr. Hoel quoted director of
housing Don Hughes as saying,
“There is cause for concem...but I
don’t think there’s cause for alarm. ’ ’
The question I have is, who is Mr.
Hughes trying to kid? Not one but
two resident students have been
violated in less time than it takes
many students to register for
classes. If this is not alarming, why
is so much effort being made to
increase dorm security? '
While trying not to moralize about
the brutality and inhumanity of rape
andits consequences on the victim,
the psychological trauma and
feeling of humiliation these two
women will have to contend with
should alarm even the most
chauvinistic administrator and per-
haps encourage him (or her) to

“Failing to Recognize a Need at Lothrop Hall

prevent future violations of female
students. If no one else is alarmed, I
sure am.

I can understand that as an
employee of the University, Mr.
Hughes should be concerned with
the protection of students and the
maintenance or order, but to brush

‘off these incidents as laxity on the

part of students by saying, “an area
still can be only as secure as the
residents make it,” seems to [me
totally irresponsible. If the students‘
in any of Pitt's dorms are supposed
to be as responsible for protecting
themselves as Mr. Hughes would
like us to believe, maybe they should
be issued handguns along with their
room keys, and then we could lay off
some of the campus police. Laugh if
you want, Mr. Hughes, but it wasn't

underlying the politics of rape in
general, but also, the picture you
paint of ’ the _“Scared stiff,”
over-reacting
‘girls’ of Lothrop Hall, is blatantly
oppressive. ,
Iworked in a rape crisis center for
two‘ years and have encountered
your attitude thousands of times;
from police, from judges, from
medical personnel, from potential
witnesses. The general attitude is to
degrade the victim, or potential
victim, in one way or another. Your
way has been to trivialize ‘the
occu/rances by __trying to .make the
women of Lothrop appear silly and
scattered.— What might have been
meant as a plea for factual
information has been read by many

‘women here at Pitt as one more ~

male attack on women (the verbal
rape which spawns the physical
rape). _ ~

Your sentence, “The number of

rapes rose as the rumors ﬁltered
through Lothrop’s halls, ” in context
only can be read to mean that women
were inventing the rapes through
rumors. Is it so hard to believe that a
rape could occur here at Pitt? Is it so
hard to believe that the rapist may be
a student who goes through
security?’ Is it so hard to - believe
when you, as spokesman for the
male institution you represent, can

make such statements as, “public .

image /is a stake,” and “rape is bad
for a school”? And then quickly
add, “but rape is worse for a girl.”
You have no idea what is worse for a
“girl” when you don’t even see us
as women and insist on keeping us
down under at the ‘ ‘girl’ ’ level even
in dealing with rape. ’

Your position‘ in this article
reminds me quite painfully and
angrily of the many attempts at
discrediting the victim (woman) by
the defense‘ attorney (usually

always male.) You do this first by
drawing a verbal composite of the
rapist as some kind of cartoon
character big _foot. You then move
on to state the “only reliable facts
come from a male security officer,”
who was. not raped or even at the
scene of the rapes, so how does he
know more “facts’ ’ than the women
who actually were attacked? The
reliable facts are, according to the
reliable security officer, “that
rumors were understandable, but
an overreaction.” And you follow
this up by saying of the rumors that,

‘ “little, if any, of this has been or will

be proven, most was a product of
fear and lack of information.” How
much of what has happened in
Lothrop was rumor or actual rape is
still unknown, and should not be
judged by you or any campus
securty ofﬁcer. Rape is very real,

READING, Pa.—Businessmen
frustrated by government red tape
can count ‘on Peter F. Flaherty to
listen to their suggestions, the

a By The Associated Press -
~ JERUSALEM—The Israeli Cab-
, inet adjourned after a seven-hour
ession yesterday without taking ’a
ecision on the draft of_a peace
treaty with Egypt. President
Carter has urged the Israelis to
ccept the document but some
ministers expressed reservations.
" ;Speaking to reporters after the
_ engtliy session, Prime Minister
 Menachem Begin said, ‘‘I hope the
" Cabinet will end its discussion
(tomorrow, _and that it will also
 make the decisions.”

Williams, who said he is a
registered Republican, touted
Flaherty as a candidate who would
work to ease rigid government
regulations, which he said covered
“how much to pay employees to
what kind of locks to put on the
men's room doors.”

Flaherty’s stern-looking audi-
ence was swirled in pipe smoke,
and the candidate appeared ner-
vous until midway into his
20-minute spech.

“Instead of you being out there
inlthe audience and me up here
talking, I should be out there with
you telling me what to do,” said
the former Pittsburgh mayor,
warming up to the crowd.

“Govemment should not be

 

telling you how to run your
business.”

Flaherty pointed to his ﬁnancial
record while mayor, where he cut
the city's payroll and ran a
deﬁcit-free budget, as proof of his
businesslike approach to govern-
ment.

Flaherty’s-Republican opponent,
Richard L. Thornburgh, has been

' critical of that record, charging that
the city suffered from such ’

wholesale budget slashing.

“I established a record as a good
manager of one of the country’s
major cities,” said Flaherty,
repeating one of his favorite
campaign themes. “My opponent
has no record so he attacks mine.”

“Everybody is analyzing,’ said
Deputy Prime Minister Yigael
Yadin. “I hope there will be a
conclusion tomorrow."

Finance Minister Simcha Ehrlich
told Israel radio after the meeting
he hoped the draft would be
ratified today. But the radio
quoted Energy Minister Yitzhak
Modai as saying the draft “raises

doubts whether this means real
peace or just a tactical step which is
not‘ real peace.”

‘0fﬁcial sources conﬁrmed press
reports that Carter cabled Begin to
urge Israel to accept the draft,
saying the negotiators had produc-
ed a good agreement.

But after 11 hours of discussion
Monday and yesterday, the Cab-
inet had neither accepted the draft’
or issued new instructions to its
negotiators. Meanwhile, Saudi
Arabia expressed a “better under-
standing” of the peace accords
after a 24-hour visit to Saudi Arabia
by President Anwar Sadat’s special
envoy, a senior Egyptian president-A

ial aide said in. Cairo.

The ofﬁcial, who asked not to be
named, said the "special envoy,

Sayed‘Marei, “explained in detail _

the agreements so far reached”
during the treaty talks in Washing-'
ton. The spokesman ‘said,
however, that it was “premature to
say that Saudi Arabia has fully
endorsed” the peace‘ accords.

Sudan is so far the only‘ Arab
country that has publicly come out
in favor of Egypt’s peace overtures
to Israel. -

Ofﬁcial statements‘ in Cairo and
press reports here indicated both
countries would ask for changes in
the 10-page text and] annexes,

\

which emerged last weekend ‘after
Carter intervened to get past
obstacles.

Also in Cairo, Prime Minister
Mustafa Khalil said Sadat had
some technical remarks about the
text’s mention of linkage between
the treaty and progress on the
separate Palestinian" problem.

The Israeli Cabi'net"s deliber-
ations were secret, but newspapers
reported that Begin‘ was satisﬁed
with a bare mention of linkage in
the,text"s preamble, through the
newspaper Haaretz, _in "an unsourc-
ed report, said Begin had reserva-
tions about the military arrange-
ment for Israel’s withdrawal’ from
the Sinai Peninsula.

Westinghouse Plea Rejected

WASHlNGTON—A guilty plea by the Westinghouse
Electric Corp. in connection with a bribe to a foriegn official
was rejected yesterday by a federal judge who was angered
at the government's refusal to reveal publicly the names of
those involved in the case.

U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker refused to
accept a negotiated plea that called for the company to plead
guilty to 30 counts of ﬁling false statements with the
government and pay $300,000 in fines. _

“I will not accept it," Parker told government and

Westinghouse lawyers. “Gentlemen, I will leave you to’

The Justice Department said lawyers were examining
their options—to drop the case, move for a trial or disclose
the information about the foreign country and official
involved. ' -

Anti-—Virus Drug Approved

WASHlNGTON—In what scientists say .is a major
breakthrough against viral diseases, the Food and Drug
Administration approved yesterday a new drug to treat a
deadly infectious brain ailment.

“Approval of this drug is particularly noteworthy because

_it holds out the hope that some day we will be able to treat
successfully other viral diseases,” said FDA Commissioner
Donald Kennedy.

The drug, Vidarabine, was developed by Parke, Davis &
Co. of Detroit, which plans to market it under the trade name

Jascalevich Innocent

l-IACKENSACK, N.J.—A jury yesterday found Dr. Mario
J ascalevich innocent of murdering three hospital patients,
while a judge released New York Times reporter Myron A.
Farber from a jail where he was conﬁned for refusing to turn
over notes in the cases.

The jailing of Farber and leveling of ﬁnes against The
Times had focused nationwide attention on the conflict
between the rights to a free press and a fair trial. The case
may still be taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court.

The jury had received the J ascalevich case Monday after
1‘/2 hours of instruction by trial judge William Arnold.
“Murder by poison is ﬁrst-degree murder,” he said’.

Premeditated murder, by law, carries a mandatory sentence
of life in prison, he added.

J ascalevich had remained free'on $150,000 bail.

The 12 jurors and one alternate, after being sequestered
overnight, returned to the Bergen County courthouse to

review testimony by a toxologist who said it is impossible to

ﬁnd curare—the muscle relaxant that prosecutors claim
Jascalevich used to kill three patients in. the mid-1960s—-
10 years after the deaths. ~ . -

Proving the presence of curare was considered key to
J ascalevich’s prosecution. ,

Shortly before theverdict was announced, Superior Court
Judge Theodore W. Trautwein ordered Farber released
fromvthe Bergan County Jail on a civil contempt penalty.
Trautwein said a six-month criminal penalty would be
suspended. The judge said that since the case had gone to
the jury, he would no longer keep Farber imprisoned for
‘withholding his notes as evidence.

Rizzo_ Takes Backdoor

PHILADELPHIA—Mayor Frank Rizzo made a back-door
exit, from his birthday party after a number of uninvited
guests showed up chanting, “Vote No” on the proposed
City Charter change. '  _r is _T,_-_._,,’ .., .

Rizzo, who‘ turned 58 on Monday, was 'eEélie'bratiii"g'i7‘-aiit as‘
party thrown by supporters at the headquarters of the
Committee to Reform the Charter. _ ‘ 

Campaigning for a charter change that would allow him to
seek a third term, Rizzo opened gifts that included‘ three
boxes of cigars, homemade banana bread, a stickpin and a
bottle of cologne. ‘

Outside the headquarters, about 20 supporters of the Stop
Rizzo Coalition, attracted by a sound truck blaring the
mayor's praises, gathered to protest the proposed charter
change.

One man stood beside the door and recited: “Humpty
Dumpty sat on the wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
All the king’s horses and all the king’s men couldn’t put
Mayor Rizzo together agaon.’' - '

Grim-lookin g Rizzo campaign aides brought several of the
mayor's supporters out to the sidewalk. One supporter said
he wanted to avoid trouble because “there are crazies on
both sides." ' *

the assembly meeting. He said he
believes it is the right of student
organizations to discuss it before
any formal action“is taken.

“This is something that I always
felt was wrong and it's about time
that it is changed,” Medoff said.
“The time is now for students to put
their foot down and demand this
change.”

Haddad blasted Medoff for his
statement. “I’m surprised that Jan
has taken such a strong stand on
changing something that he was
one of the strongest supporters of,’ ’
Haddad said. Later she pointed out
that it was Medoff who drew up the

_original contract between the

Student Government Board and the
Office of Student Activities.
“Medoff has not been to one

amP"5'

PUPC meeting all year and has
refused to support us in any way,”
Haddad said. “I’m especially
annoyed with his presentation
today, which showed no facts.

“It was really nothing more than
an emotional display. He said that
he acted today as a concerned
student but a concerned student
would have facts to back him up.”

The Program Council as a whole
came under attack by Mark
Holloway ‘of the Black Action
Society who called for $70,000 of the
$110,000 allocation received by
Program Council to be turned back
over to the Student Government
Board for reallocation to various
student organizations.

“PUPC was given $110,000 this
year and didn’t even have to bid,”

Holloway said.” -I think that much

of this money has been used in the

wrong way.”

Holloway said the Black Action
Society hopes that the Program
Council will be restructured to
include more student input from all
student organizations.

Haddad answered Holloway’s
charges by saying that any student
is eligible for membership in the
Program Council.

' “PUPC is not staffed; it is

“completely run by students and

anyone is invited to join,” Haddad
said. “Our main concern and top
priority is the students.”

After lengthy discussion on
concert programming and restruc-
turing, the Program Council
conceded that a stalemate had been

“There are some gripes with

as concert programming goes, I was

buying into concerts through

‘Iron City’ Brewery Keeps Pouring It On  

By LEONARD ROMBERG ’

American beer brewing was a “ma
and pa”-business in the 1700 s. In
1978, brewing companies are
among the Fortune 500.

Pittsburgh, once the gateway to
the west, has had its share of'suc-
cess in brewing history. The city's
first major brewery, located near the

3!'2.Point, produced 5,000 barrels a

-year. The king of the local breweries,
Pittsburgh Brewing Co. (maker of Iron
City beer), now produces that much
beer in a day.

The original ' Iron City Brewery
opened in" 1861. After its merger
with 21 small breweries in 1899, it
became Pittsburgh Brewing Co. The
company survived Prohibition, ex--
panded its operations, and remained
Pittsburgh’s top brewery. It now em-
ploys 275 workers (it began with
25), and brews and packages all its
beer at one Liberty Avenue plant.

3;» But there is more to a brewery’s

survival than size and production.
Today, Pittsburgh Brewing Co.

budgets tens of thousands of dollars. -
for TV and‘ radio campaigns to

promote its many beer brands.)
Creative packaging is another

promotional'device necessary to .

boost sales. -

In ‘contrast to national brewing
giants such as Miller and Anheuser-
Busch, Pittsburgh Brewing Co._is a
predominantly regional brewery. Its
goal is to stay number one in its own
backyard. 1

“Iron City beer enjoys the number-

‘Wione position in the Pittsburgh

marketplace, and has for some time,”
said John S. de Coux, company vice
president in charge of advertising.
"Consolidation of regional beer com-
panies has lessened the competitive
situation we once faced. There are
fewer companies now."

“Market segmentation," the
division of the beer market with bran-
ds such as premiums, light beers,
and domestically produced beers
with imported names, also has altered
the brewing industry, de Coux said.

“We feel a regional brewery needs
more than one brand to survive
today,” de Coux said. “As many

messages into the market as

0}?!‘ , .4‘

 

brands as can be funded should be in
the market.”

Dr. Coux charged Miller and
Anheuser-Busch were the originators
of this practice. Smaller breweries
are forced to follow their lead.

Sierra, a higher-priced premium
beer, and Iron City Light, a low-
calorie brand, are Pittsburgh Brewing
Co.’s_ answer to the market segmen-
tation problem. So is television ad-
vertising aimed at a male audience 21
years old and up.

process:

ted to sugar. ‘

0 THE BREWING PROCESS

While there are many ways to brew beer, which vary in processing details
and materials, the following is a general description of the modern brewing‘

Barley (malt) is ground in a mill and added to pure hot water in a giant mash
.5, tub. The mash is heated. Another combination of corn or.rice with a little
malt is mixed with water in a cooker and heated to boiling point. -
The second mixture becomes gelatinized and is added to the first mix.
The new combination stays heated until the starch in the grains are conver-

After this mashing process is complete, the mash is filtered through lauter
tubs which retain the unsoluble protions of the grains. The new, extract,
wort, is poured into the brew kettle where it is boiled.
Hops are then added, giving beer its familiar fragrance and flavor. The
wort is later passed through a hop separator to remove the extracted hops.
_ The wort is codedand then prepared for fermentation with sterile air, so

the yeast will grow. Yeast is added and over a 10-to-12 day period its
,3, metabolism converts carbohydrates to carbon dioxide and alcohol. The fer-
mentation converts the wort to beer. 0

Carbon dioxide is removed, liquified and added to the beer during its later '

storage. The beer and yeast are separated and run through coolers into
primary storage tanks. After the beer has matured it is transferred to secon-
dary storage tanks. The storage usually lasts two or three months before the
beer is filtered and packaged into bottles’, cansand kegs. '

I

Although a_ novice beer drinker
may not notice the difference bet-

ween premium and light beer,- their
-composition is not the same. ’

“All beers are made in the same

-manner, but differ in materials," said

Tony Dalesandro, the company's
master brewer.

Different amounts of malt (barley),

corn and hops are used in brewing a
regular lager beer (Iron City), a cream
ale (Robin Hood) or a premium
(Sierra). “The best and most expen-
sive hops, imported from Germany
and Czechoslovakia, are used in
Sierra," Dalesandro said.

Light beer—whose production has
added many more beer drinkers, in-
cluding women, to the market—is
produced by adding enzymes to
beer. This drastically reduces the
carbohydrate level, and thus the
‘calorie count.

Beer brewing is a two-to-three-
month process. (See the box below
for further brewing information.) At
Pittsburgh Brewing Co., the brewing.
cycle is started eight times a day.
Each batch of beer consists of 600
barrels (there are 31 gallons per
barrel). The plant runs 24 hours a
day, and brewing ceases only during
cleaning . periods, usually held on
Fridays.

As any beer can collector knows,
Iron City, Robin Hood, Sierra and Iron
City Light are just the most common
products of Pittsburgh Brewing Co.
Bonzo, Mustang, 905 Light, Tech
and Olde Frothingslosh are among

the over two dozen brands the com-'

pany once marketed or currently is
selling.

One reason for the variety of beer
brands is that Pittsburgh Brewing Co.
has, over the past six years, bought
the rights to brands made by

«breweries that were going out of_

«V

business. These included August

Wagner and Queen City Brewing in .

Cumbertand, Md. Beer made_at the.

Liberty _Avenue, plant now is '

packaged under the old labels.
“There is still some volume to be
done in the home markets of the
closed breweries," de Coux said.
“These, are unfunded brands. We

don't spend any money to promote

 

them "

 

Although the company sells beer.

throughout the country, its general‘

marketing range lies within a radius

bounded by -Johnstown, Erie,

Wheeling and Stubenville.
Promotional beer brands, such as

’ the Iron City Steelers and Super Bowl
series, also help to boost the com--

|oany's sales, de Coux said.‘ A
minimum‘ of 10,000 cases must be
produced in order to call a beer a
brand.

Then there is the strange case of '
Olde Frothingslosh, developed as a _,
joke 22 years ago. Its can features

an obese woman in a bathing suit.

“A local disc jockey, Rege Cordic,
was spoofing beer ads by talking
about Olde Frothingslosh, a beer that
had foam on the bottom, and was
pale, stale ale brewed with 'hippity
hops,’ ” explained de Coux. “So one
of~our people said to Cordic, ‘What
would you sayif we put out an Dlde
Frothingslosh and made fun of it?’ "

The beer, originally advertised asa
holiday brew, was a big success. It
now sells a minimum of 20,000
cases per year andits campy can is in
its seventh edition.

Despite its promotionalgimmickry,
the brewing industry is big business.
Almost three dozen companies com-
pete in the national market, and‘
regional breweries must use
magination to survive.

Pittsburgh Brewing Co. is deter-
mined to do just that, even if survival
depends on thecharms of the lady on
the Olde Frothingslosh can. \

  Beers That Make Students Foam at the Mouth

By CRIS HOEL

Pitt's campus is a fragmented one,
populated by commuters, night
students, graudate students, Greeks,
dorm residents and apartment-
renters. But while this splintered
group has been unable to form a
unified ‘student body, it is drawn
together when choosing a beer.
Miller and Stroh’s seem to be the
brands preferred by most Pitt stu-
dents.

The biggest brew across the
nation is, and has been, Budweiser,
and Iron City continues to corrode
the pipes of about one-quarter of Pit-
tsburgh’s beer-drinkers. But Oaklan-
d's students, distributors and bar
owners agree that Miller and Stroh’s,

' recent risers in suds surveys, are.

ovenivhelming favorites at Pitt.

Students interviewed for a Fifth
‘Ave survey gave Miller 34 percent of
their “favorite brand” votes; Stroh’s,
with 27 percent, was the only other
beer to be named by at least 10 per-
cent of the 200 students surveyed.

Miller Lite, the massively promoted
newcomer that contains fewer
calories and less alcohol than Miller
High Life, was third, with 9.5 per-
cent

Miller, second to Budweiser
across the country, is fourth—behind
Stroh’s, Iron City and Schmidt’s—in
Allegheny County. Stroh’s is eighth
in the national rankings (it was 10th
eight years ago), trailing such locally
unfamiliar labels as Olympia and
Heileman.

Distributors serving Oakland affir-
med the campus survey results.
“The students are buying Miller
throwaway bottles and Stroh’s cans,"
a spokesman at Craig Distributors in
North Oakland said. “A good percen-

tage of our business is with studen-
ts...mostly cases. And the college
bars go for Stroh’s and Miller, too."

“About 80 percent of our
business involves Pitt,” Sharon
Bellisario of Me|linger’s Semple
Street beer distributor said. ‘‘Miller is
first, Stroh’s is next and they're
drinking a lot of Lite now."

Once September's students hit
Oakland, they drink. a lot of
everything, according to Bellisario.
"We might move 50 half-kegs during
August,” she said, “but when Sep-
tember rolls around, it probably’.
_comes "to 350.”

Another large-volume distributor at
Pitt is Pete Maracini, who handles
only Anheuser-Busch products. “We
handle about 75 percent of Pitt's
fraternities,” the general manager at
Maracini’s said, “and they're pretty
good beer drinkers. Most of them
take Busch, especially for parties, but
they're buying Bud and Michelob,
too."

Maracini employs a campus
representative (Paul Doughtery of Pi
Kappa Alpha) in an effort “to generate
good will and for promotion pur-
poses," the spokesman said.

Dougherty said Busch Beer, an

Anheuser product, is consumed
frequently at Pitt, though students did
not put Busch on their list of favorites.
They drink a lot of it," he said. “Any
good fraternity party will go through
six or eight kegs, and most of them
buy Busch.

“Once there was a party after the

. 1976 Pitt-USC "game _ when they

went through 15 half kegs—that’s
120 cases of beer—in one night,”
Dougherty said.

“Students have changed their
tastes, though not so much in the

very recent past," said Bill Gormley
of Gustine’s, a Forbes Avenue
restaurant and bar that attracts many
evening students. “Stroh’s and Miller
are the big beers with night students
and day students,” Gormley said. ‘‘I
don't think there's an awful lot of dif-
ference between the two groups,
though the night students might drink
a bit more of the premium ‘beers.

“A couple of brands have fallen by
the wayside," he added. “Iron City is
being bought like it once was, and
Schlitz and Schmidt's—which used to
be popular with students—aren't
even asked for anymore."

“l-t’s Miller and Stroh's," agreed
Pete Mitchell," owner of Mitchell's

.Tavern (Centre and Craig, North

Oakland). “And it's been that way for
a couple of years. The students are a
good group—they're a big part ofthe
business here at night—and you'll
hear a lot of them saying ‘Miller’ and
‘Stroh’s,’ though Michelob and
Heineken are doing all right.” 3

“Students buy a lot of pitchers,"
said a bartender at the Luna, another
North Oakland student bar. “And
here, that's Miller and Iron City Light.

Bottled Miller is a good seller, though, 3

and so is Miller Lite. »

“Schr_nidt’s, Bud and Iron City
don't sell too well these days,” the
bartender added, explaining the swit-
ch that has seen Miller grab a growing
part of the student market during the
past few years. “And we don't even
carry Schlitz anymore.

When students want a six- or nine-
pack and don't want to pay tavern
prices, they head toward the Original
Hot Dog Shop, which has been
selling beer—a great deal of it-to Pitt
students for years.

“With students, Stroh’s is number N

one,” Sid Simon, owner of what he
called “The Big ‘O,’ " said. “And
number two would be Miller.'’

Simon said Stroh’s edges Miller
because of price. “Stroh’s is
cheaper," he said. ‘‘If prices were
equal, Miller would kill the others.

“There's a real rat race in the beer
market," Simon said. . “Miller's
marketing makes its beer so hot that
they can raise prices all the

\

time...they've done it three or four 5

times recently. And. everyone else

follows Miller.
“But people would buy Miller no

matter what they charge," he added.

“It’s good beer."

The best beer buy in Oakland must
be Simon's “special,” which gives
the consumer six 16-oz. cans of a
featured brand for $2. “We started
the special when we began to sell
beer here, about nine years ago,”

Simon said. “Our first special was
Stroh’s, for $1 .65. But that beer was
so slow then that we couldn't give it

away. We ran that stuff as a special .

for ‘three years straight, off and on.
But no one would buy it. ‘ ,

“Then it got big,” he said. “And
we didn't have it for a while because
there was so much demand we
couldn't get it."

 The rise of Stroh’s has largely
been-restricted to the area between .
Michigan and the’East Coast, while
the Miller surge has been-and is ex-
pected to continue to be—national in

nature. . But their current popularity at
Pitt's Oakland campus is un-
mistakable. ‘And their success, ac-
cording to those who know local
beer, may not yet have come to a
head. ' 0 '

Collector Find Cans AreAIuminum niiques

By CRIS HOEL

At the Delta Tau Chi house, John
Blutarsky crushes Carling Black Label
cans, head-on, against his forehead.

At Pitt recently, others have been

S bashing Miller, Stroh’s and Lite cans,

lengthwise, into their foreheads.

Everywhere else, beer" drinkers
have been tossing empties along coun-
try roadsides, throwing them in" the

  

vicinity of wastebaskets, using them as
ashtrays or. pencil-holders or ‘tying

7 them to newlyweds’ bumpers.

, But beer cans are not always
treated with such disdain after their
contents are a blurred memory. More
than 100,000Americans collect the
cans, and Pitt student Steve Guidas is
one of them. '

_“l wasstaggering home from a party
one night during my freshman year,
and sitting outside my Towers door
was an empty Coors can. I managed to
get it on a shelf inside my room, and
that was the beginning. '

“The next night'l was drinking

Stroh’s from a can at a party and l star-
ted thinking about that Coors can.
I took the Stroh’s home, and the collec-
tion was growing.” ' _
That was three years and, for
Guidas, more than 400 different cans
ago. ‘‘I like my collection, and_there is
some good stuff-in it,” Guidas said,
“but it's small compared to some I've
heard about or seen at can-ventions.”

Guidas has all of the cans most Pitt
students. have seen and he also has
gathered some more unusual
pieces—a ‘batch of Bicentennial
editions, the first pop-top can (issued,
incidentally, by _lron City) distributed in
the world, several obscure foeign cans
not found even in catalogs and con-
tainers ranging in size from 7 oz. (Pab-

 

,%

st) to 25 oz. (Foster's_Lag‘er).

, -Why is a Pitt" student interested in
empty beer cans, especially “cone-

tops” that resemble bottles and “flat-

tops that require an opener?

"Building a collection like this is
great,” Guidas said, “for lots of
reasons. One of the most important is
the cost-'—this hasn't cost me a cent,
other than whatl paid for ‘the beer. It's
a lot of fun once you get started, and

other people are interested, too, since .

S it's fairly uncommon.

“It isn’t like collecting stamps or
coins, where the person with the most
money has the best collection,” he ad-
ded, “and drinking the beer is a hell of
a lot more fun than licking those stam-
ps.”

Guidas has been able to amass a
sizeable collection‘ without making a
substantial investment due to the
trading he does. ‘Beer cans are plen-
tiful—limited editions are rare, since
the brewers wish to sell as ‘much beer
as possible—so the main problem is

« acquiring cans from‘ other portions of
the country. ‘ T

g It is easy for Guidas to buy a, case of
Olde Frothingslosh, a humorous label
. that the Pittsburgh Brewing Company
markets at the end of each, year. But it

is difficult for someone in Arizona to lay _

hands on.Olde Frothingslosh, which is

a favorite novelty can among collectors.

Thus it is an even trade when
-Guidas surrenders a few Olde
Frothingsloshes and receives, in
return, several A-1 beer cans imprinted
with the Phoenix Suns’ basketball
schedule. ‘

Not all cans come from so far away.
‘‘I_ was down at an Oakland distributor

 

couple of years ago,” Guidas said,
“and I started to talk with a woman who
worked there. I told her about my

collection and she said her husband

had found a bunch of old flat-top F&S

beer cans. The brewery was defunct
and the cans didn't have a pop-top,

r so I was interested, since I had just

started collecting.

“The cans still were full, but they

S were 24 years old. So I thanked them

for the can they gave me, took it home
and put it on a shelf in the living room.

"The can got mixed in with some
other not-so-old cans I needed, and

. my mother put them in the refrigerator.

l told my father to be sure to open
those cans from the bottom ifghe
opened them at all. '

"He apparently ran out of beer one

_ night and went for the l-T&S...the beer

shot straight to the ceiling, but thecan
was OK." '

There are stories behind even those
cans for whose contents Guidas can-

A not account:

“A friend went to Europe 8 While
back,” he said, “and I asked him to
bring back a few cans.

“He got a little carried away and
broughtenough cans to fill a shopping
bag...but he tried to fit them in his suit-
case. He had to leave his pajamas in a
hotel room in Belgium."

Some of Guidas’ more interesting
cans originated overseas. He has a
Heineken can produced in Holland that
sports a red star; locally available
Heinekens carry a white star‘ becuse

' the company did not want its beer to

be associated with Communism.

Mark Zola, 34, a wage-laboring

 _ steelworker currently on strike again-

st Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Com-
pany, is this year's Socialist Workers’
Party candidate for governor of
Pennsylvania.

Not that very many people know
that, of course. Unlike the
newspaper and television roadshows

 put on by his Democratic and

Republican opponents, Zola's cam-

:1 " paign is not a media event. So when I

called his Pittsburgh headquarters
asking for an interview, the

V arrangements were made without dif-

ficulty. Access to the candidate
during a qneqjay campaign trip was
no problem. The Party, -it seems,
welcomed the publicity. .

Ten o'clock, Saturday morning,

 September 23rd: The sun outside
 - was white and warm, and I was sitting

in the Militant Bookstore on Penn

 Avenue—SWP campaign network,

East Liberty branch—waiting for Zola.
Behind my chair, neatly stacked on
shelves near the storefront window,

_'V ‘V were a hundred or so paper-bound
,‘ volumes of classical and contem-
~. ; , porary socialist literature, all for sale.

The Marxist-Leninist canon was well
represented by the various

 Manifestos, Criticisms and Strategies

available, and the works of Trotsky
were given a prominent place. Stalin,
on the other hand, did not seem to be
on the Party's recommended reading
list.

The SWP, I later learned, was

 V founded largely as a reaction against

the “Stalinization" of the Russian
revolution. A small group of American

 communists—among them, James P.

Cannon, a radical internationalist who
is now one of the Party's patron sain-
ts—fol|owed Trotsky’s lead in 1928
and condemned Stalin's “false
politics'_’ ‘ of_ nationalism and
bureaucratization. Shortly thereafter,

 [ Cannon and a few others were boun-
' - ced from the American Communist

Party. Ten years later, on Jan. 1,
1938, they formed the SWP at a

 mini-convention in Chicago.

The new revolutionary elite
organized the P'arty along Trotskyist
ideological lines, and Cannon hailed it

h - as "the restoration, the revival, of

genuine Marxism as it was expoun-
ded and practiced in the Russian
revolution." The Bolshevik Party of
Lenin's day was identified as the
paradigm for true revolutionary
praxis, and the SWP entered the
1940's believing, as ever, in the
eventual triumph of the working
class. Cannon and many others went
to jail under the Smith Act during the
war years, and the Party was cut
deeply by Mccarthyist enthusiasms
in the early 1950's, but it remains
alive and active in the electoral
process today.

Still, the SWP suffers from the

same basic problemthat haunted it

 40 years ago. Now, as"

then—despite the membership's faith

if «in Marxist doctrine, despite the
 g remarkable dedication of its quasi-

professional leadership, despite the

_ rhetorical prowess of its streetcor-_
» ner-based ideological auctioneers-

the Party is still suffering from a
severe dearth of left-leaning, class-
conscious, politically interested

‘_ _ proletarians.

Around 10:20, Zola came striding
in, full of breakfast and political
energy. My first thought was

Zola: Socialist Campaigning in a Capitaliststate

that—cliche or not—this man didn't
look like a politician. Short and thin,
with a bristlebrush moustache tucked
under his nose, Zola was obviously
no vested and shoe-shined frequen-
ter of anybody’s Capitol. In his brown
doubleknit pants, blue chambray
workshirt and dull-yellow, square-
bottomed tie, he looked—whether by
design or by nature—decidedly
working class.

Along with his campaig/n manager '

and two others, Zola and I wedged.
ourselves into a staff Chevy for the
drive to Marianna, a small mining
community in southern Washington
County. We were going out, as they
say in the trade, “to meet the

people." Responding to the working V

class demands of our driver (it was
his staff Chevy), Party members each
chipped in a dollar for gas.

\ Two-barreling down interstate 79,



the candidate opened up. He talked,
as politicians will, about his platform: -
Shortening the work week to 30
hours with no cuts in pay; using the
“war budget" to finance a public
works program;_'shifting the tax bur-
den onto the corporations;
nationalizing banks and major in-
dustries when possible; women's
rights; abortion rights; black rights;
Latino rights; no nukes; no death
penalty; Pitt Out of South Africa and
on_ and on. In the manner of
politicians, he continually returned to
simple, concepts and major themes.

More than anything, he wanted to talk

V about the need for a labor party.

“The Democratic Party claims to
represent both Henry Ford II and the
auto-worker on his assembly” line in
Detroit,” Zola said. “We don't think
that's real. We think the assembly
line worker is the loser_ in that com-
bination.

“The working class has different
interests than the capitalist class. A
labor party would represent those in‘-
terests, and it would represent the
huge majority of people in this coun-
try. Most Americans are part of the
working class . . 

“But is there really any kind of
class consciousness
American workers?" lasked. Plat-
forms and labor parties are important,
I was thinking, but they weren't‘what
I'd come for. Pretensions of incisive,
insightful, intellectual political jour-
nalism were dancing in my head. I
wanted to talk aboutMarxism, and its
potential for success in the American
political marketplace.

“Class consciousness is
developing," Zola replied. “Yeah, I
see it. I'm not saying everyone thinks
this way, but there's definitely a layer
of younger people . . . and a layer of
older people who remember the
1930's and 1940's and are begin-
ning to get theirjuices up-again.”

Geriatric juices were not quite
what I was looking for, so I tried a

among .

tougher question, one that I thought
would get to the heart of the thing,
one that would stimulate some fast-
paced theoretical discourse (as. if
“fast-paced theoretical discourse"
weren't a contradiction in terms).
Surely the socialist had something
sensational for the readers.

“Will it take," I asked in mymost
leading tone of voice, “will it take a
violent revolution —as Marx thought it
would—to overthrow the capitalist
system?”

“Well," Zola answered, shrugging
his shoulders just a little, “it’s kind of
up to the small handful of people who
now rule this country. Just like every
other genuine social transformation,
it's going to be a huge outpouring of
the great majority of people. But it's
hard to say how it's going to happen.
if we went by all past examples, it's

more than likely that the small number

  
  

of people who run society today are
not going to want to give in
peacefully.” _

That was all—as matter-of fact as
that. It appeared there would be no
lurid or nefarious revolutionary-
quotes from this politician. The
destruction of the capitalist order is.
so inevitable, Zola seemed to say, it
will really be quite mundane. Just a
“huge outpouring of the great

- majority of people."

I looked out -the window at the
windswept Washington ‘County far-
mland, and wondered.

-Zola joined the SWP in 1968,
during the heyday of the movement
against the Vietnam War. Living in
Philadelphia at the time, he helped
organize some of the major anti-war
demonstrations of the late 1960's
and early 1970's. For several mon-
ths, he was the civilian editor of The
Ultimate Weapon, an anti-war GI‘
newspaper at Fort Dix, N.J.~ In 1970,
he ran for lieutenant governor and
lost-decisive|y—getting less than
3,000 votes to winner Ernest Kline's
;2,043,029. Two summers ago,
having joined Steelworkers Local
2789 as a machinist apprentice at

Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel, Zola '

was involved in Ed Sadlowski’s un-
successful bid for the USW

. presidency.

Relaxed and confident, Zola is a
convincing speaker and a devoted
socialist. Though he is an activist
rather than an intellectual, he knows

his doctrine and is comfortable with

its polemic. (Indeed, anyone who
has read as obscure a work as Fat
Cats and Democrats —and Zola says
he has—must be thoroughly steeped
in socialist political analysis.)

Zola“ believes that the Democratic
and Republican parties are subser-
vient to corporate interests, and he is
convinced that there can be no real
freedom or responsibility in a profit-
motivated, capitalist-controlled

‘ ‘American

economic system. He is, to a large
extent, probably correct.

He also believes—wrongly, l
think—that racism and other cultural

' maladies are primarily the result of
capitalistic economics. He seems to
think that the key to a just and
equitable society lies in working class
control over government and in-
dustry.—proletarians running society
in what they perceive to be “their in-
terests." And he believes—strongly
enough to run for governor—that the
working. class is getting more
politically conscious, “more open to
alternative political solutions."

It is this last problem—working
class acceptance of radical alter-
natives-that must concern Zola and
the SWP very much, especially now.
Having chosen to use the electoral

process as a way to promote Marxian’

dogma, the SWP .must depend on a
large or growing constituency if-it is
to maintain any credibility in the public
mind. Yet that constituency is vir-
tually non-existent.

Unionization, perhaps more than
anything else, has impeded the
“pro|etarianization" of the American
working class. it has helped raise the

general standard of living in this coun-4
' try to a level far beyond that which is

normally considered to be ex-
ploitative or oppressive. And, while

unionization has enabled workers to .

band together and feel the strength
of a consolidated front, ithas done so
under the banner of values that are
inimical to the idea of a socialist
revolution: free enterprise, private
ownership, maximization of individual
wealth and security.

There is something else hap-
pening in American society right now
that bodes ill for Zola and the
SWP—something that can't be‘
blamedon socialists, though they are
made to share in the penalty. Among
the middle class, the working class

- and the Iumpenproletariat alike, there

is moving across the face of our post-
Vietnam, post-Watergate, post-
prosperity culture, a deep-seated and

' cynical disdain for politics—of any

sort.

Arriving in Marianna, an old com--
pany town presently servicing
Bethlehem’s No. 58 mine, our group
split up, having decided to go door to
door and cover as much territory as
possible. ._’This was United Mine
Workers country—heartland_ of the

message had to be delivered here, if
anywhere. Zola and I started at the
first in arow of identical, unkempt
houses, houses thrown together by
some capitalist coal company a long
time ago, houses seriously lacking
any architectural aesthetic. A‘ short,
fat, black woman in a safety-pinned
pink bathrobe answered the can-
didate’s knock.

“Yeah?”

“Good afternoon! My name is

, Mark Zola and I'm running for gover-

nor on the Socialist Workers’ Party
ticket. . 

“Oh, yeah?" The woman im-
mediately took her eyes off the man

in the doorway and found things to .

look at in the upper left corner of the-
front porch.

“Yes. Did you know _I was running
against Flaherty and Thornburgh?"

‘‘I didn't even know they was run-
nln’." - -

“l see. Uh, are you registered to
vote?" _

“Naw, I don't vote. Don't do no
damn good anyhow." ‘

Czechoslovak Room Reflects 

By MARY JANE MCKEEVER

( This article, the second in a series
on Pitt’s Nationality Rooms, deals
with the formation of the Nationality
Rooms committees and the history of
the Czechoslovak Room . The
author is. a Nationality Rooms tour

guide.)

One evening in 1926/, Chancellor
John G. Bowman spoke to a group of
about 1 ,OOO steelworkers, their
wives and children in Duquesne,

“You came to America not to
stay,” Bowman said. -“You came to
make money, and then to go home.
But most of‘ you are not going
home...and your children are growing
up to become citizens‘ of the United

States. Tell me something. Are we _

to have a better United States, or a
worse one, because you came? Did
you bring some ideas or ways of
living that will make a better United
States? If so, what did you bring?”

Bowman wanted both to involve
Pittsburghers in the University and to
‘demonstrate the contributions
various ethnic groups had made to
the Pittsburgh community. -A few
days after his speech in Duquesne,
he contacted Ruth Crawford Mitchell,
then a lecturer in sociology at the
University. Mitchell soon began to
meet with various ethnic groups to
devise plans for infusing Pittwith the
spirit of their cultural heritages.

“She (Mitchell) gave out trust and
affection...and before long, each
group had worked out a plan to build
a room at the University and to ex-
press in that room what they con-
sidered of most value in their
heritage," Bowman wrote in his book
Unofficial Notes. ‘‘...In effect,-the
national ‘groups were to become
teachers of these values to the folk of
Pittsburgh, and so tobring about
good will and understanding.” A

By 1927, Mitchell and several
other persons had drawn up
guidelines for the construction of the
first 18 Nationality Rooms. Each
room was to depict a period in the
country represented prior to 1787
(the year in which the United States
Constitution was ratified and the
University was founded). Native

_ construction materials, architects and

artisans were to be employed as
much as was possible. No political
symbols or living persons were to be
represented in the room.

The_ 18 Nationality Room commit-
tees formed by 1930 had respon-
sibilities beyond the initial construc-
tion guidelines. First, each commit-
tee had to raise enough money to

commission an architect. After the

architect developed a design that met V

with the approval of Mitchell and the
committee, the design was submitted
to the University architect; After his
approval was obtained the committee
was allocated space on the first floor
of the Cathedral of Learning.

Size of the space allocated
depended on the space available, the
design of the room and, most impor-
tantly, the financial resources ‘of the
committee. Bake sales, dances and
private donations were among the
means used to raise money to con-.
struct and decorate the Nationality
Rooms. The resources of the people
of Pittsburgh, not the University,
were responsible for the completion
of this project.

“The stones of the Commons
Room can bear witness,” said
Bowman. “There, each of the rooms
was dedicated, often before a
thousand or more people.”

The Nationality Rooms completed’,

between 1938 and 1957 include:
Czechoslovak, Italian, German,

.Hungarian, Polish, Irish, Lithuanian,

Rumanian, Swedish, Chinese, Greek,
Scottish, Yugoslav, English, French,
Norwegian, Russian and Syria-
Lebanon.

Many of the Nationality Room»

Committees are still active, and

sponsor scholarships for summer‘

study abroad. _‘
Three new nationality rooms

currently are under consideration: . .

Armenian, Ukranian and African
Heritage.

THE CZECHOSLOVAK ROOM

Czechoslovakia, a nation com-
posed of Czech and Slovak provinces
once governed by the Austrian Hap-

. sburgs, came into existence on Oct.

28, 1918, when the Czech National
Committee assumed the government
of Czech lands. Two days later, the
Slovaks joined the Czechs to form a
single state. ‘A republic was

- established on Nov. 13, and Tomas

Garrigne Masaryk became the first
president of Czechoslovakia the next
day.

Masaryk believed in the equality of

all people. When he married Char|ot- .

te Garrigne he took her name as his

middle name; all of their children

carried it as well. _ o

Stanley Protrednik, a member of
the Czechoslovak Nationality Room
committee since 1945, once worked
as a gardener at Hradcany Castle in
Prague, where Masaryk lived.

“One morning, I was working on

two trees,” Protrednik -recalled.
“President Masaryk ‘came up to me
and said, ‘You are like a doctor; you
care for the trees.’ I care for the
people.’

“He never liked security men
around him,” Protrednik continued.
“Once, in the country, he was sitting
with many peasants around him. He
saw the security men with the guns in

1968 to August 1968), when the
Czechs rebelled against Soviet rule,
an investigation of ‘ Jan Masaryk's
death was undertaken.

“Jan Masaryk was a very brave ‘

man," said Stanley Pro.trednik. who
last saw Masaryk at a dinner in 1942.
“ln 1945, before he returned to
Prague, people warned him not to go
back. Yet he went back. Jan told his

friends that he had promised his ‘

 

FRANKS

their shoulder holsters ready. He
shooed them away, saying, ‘What
could happen to me here? I am
among my people.’ ”

In 1937, two years before his new
Republic was occupied by Germany,

. Masaryk died. Czechoslovakia was

occupied for six years during the war,
years in ‘which its universities were
closed and in which its government
was-in exile in London, under the
leadership of Dr. Edouard Benes.

, When Benes returned to Prague
after the war, he was accompanied
by Jan Masaryk, Tomas Masaryk's
son. Jan Masaryk had promised his
father, shortly before the older man's
death, that he would remain by
Benes’s side.

. Czechoslovakia was liberated from

the Nazis in May 1945, but it fell im-

mediately under Soviet domination,
as determined by’ agreements made
at the Yalta and Teheran Conferen-
ces. The Soviets were so anxious to
maintain their control of the area that
on May 5, 1945, when the citizens of
Prague revolted against the Nazis,
they refused Gen. T Dwight D.
Eisenhower's offer to send Gen.
George Patton's army into Prague.
Patton's army was 60 miles away at
the time; the Soviet troops were 120
miles away. Two thousand Czechs

_ died in the two days it took the

Russians to reach Prague._

Jan Masaryk was named Foreign
Minister of the new Czech gover-
nment, the only non-Communist
member of the Cabinet. He held
some hope that democracy could
return to Czechoslovakia, and his
name was symbolic of Czech
nationalism. ‘

Jan Masaryk was found dead on .

the ground, three floors below the
open window of his apartment at
Czev Palace, on March 10, 1948.
Government officials and in-
vestigators termed the death a
suicide. Many people, "in view of the
threat Masaryk posed to Soviet con-
trol of Czechoslovakia, doubted this
judgement. Hundreds of thousands’
of people filled the streets of Prague
for Masaryk's funeral procession.

sary of the birth of his father, Tomas .-

Masaryk.

“May l say thank you that you

 ‘In the October 1978 issue of
“Record Review Magazine,”
Freddie Hubbard described his
self-imposed creative exile of the
past four years. “I became caught
in the middle of jazz-rock fusion,”
he said. “All my peers, my
friends, were recording commercial

trying to play hot licks and it just

wasn’t worth it.” _

Lab Theater's ‘Empire Builders’ Thrillin

ByMARKHOLAN '

If you’re‘in the mood for a good psychological scare during this

Halloween season, consider seeing “The Empire Builders,” now
_ playing ast the Pittsburgh Laboratory Theater. This one act play will
give you more shocks than any high-budget horror ﬂick or its sequel.

The play is the creation of Boris Vian, a German whose work has only
recently been recognized in this coutry. Besides being a playwright,
Vian was also a poet, novelist, translator, singer, jazz trumpeter,
chemist, /medical pharmacist and civil engineer. Ill throughout most of
his life, Vian wrote “The Empire Builders’ ’ in three hours after learning
he had just two months left to live. He died of a rare heart disease in
April 1959 at the age of thirty-eight, two days before the first
performance of his play.

“The Empire Builders” concerns theemacabre fate of three family
members and their maid who are pursued by an unknown fear that is
represented by a series of recurring high-pitched whines and a
mummy-like “Schmurz’f played by David Lindberg. -Literally
translated, Schmurz means deathly pain. (Vian wrote many of his
literary works under the pseudonym Adolphe Schmurz.) V .

Rather than face this fear, the family and their maid continually flee
from it. They don’t leave their home in hopes of finding some less
haunted abode. Instead, they keep gathering their belongings and
retreating further up the steps of their apartment house.

Radios, clocks and living essentials are left behind in these frenzied '

midnight retreats, but in their fear and ignorance the family makes do,
or at least feigns to. No one will return downstairs because of the fear of
the unknown, and as the playjprogresses, anyone who does descend
disappears in a horrible death scream.

As the players retreat further up the tiered stage, a member of the

family is sacriﬁced. Mug (Romana Fischer), the sassy maid, quits her‘

job and storms out of the apartment. She is the first to die. Zenobia

(Patty Pelez), the daughter, the only one who questions the meaning of
the ever-present Schmurz, is killed when she leaves to borrow a bed
from the neighbors.

The mother, Anna (Trish Beatty),does not make it to the top tier with
her husband Leon. The theater is plunged into darkness, there is a
scream, and in the second scene, only Leon and the Schmurz remain.
_ Leon is played by Bingo O’Malley. Director Bill Royston considers
him one of the area’s fmestactors, and the compliment is certainly well

‘ deserved. His mad monologue is "frighteningly excellent.

_ - _ I

\

“Man is the only animal that is not ananimal,” quivers Leon as he '

explodes into a fit of schizophrenic rationalizations, clutchingat thelast

vestiges of his materialistic world: a sword, his ﬁeld marshal’s uniform A’

and cap, one of his wife's dresses and ﬁnally, a meat grinder. _

The intimacy of the Lab Theater sets the horror of “The Empire"

Builders” right down in the audience's lap, and the surprise ending is

sur.e to give your heart thebest work out it has had in months. Happy

Halloween.

die-hard fans and the odd disc jockey who’ll play him, however, no one
knows who Gallagher is. , .

What has kept Gallagher back is his image—'he has none.

Some popular musicans make headlines through drug busts, getting
sued by ex-lovers or breaking up hotel rooms. Gallagher’s music has
always stood on its own without the gimmicky frills. The unfair result:
he’s unknown. I

In Pittsburgh he gathered a great deal of airplay on WYDD-FM when
the station was truly free-form; he has been ingored as of late, not only
here but throughout the United States. .

In fact, when Gallagher was scheduled to headline a specially priced

‘Thanksgiving show at the Civic Arena two years ago, It was cancelled

when the promoter realized there would be more readies and band
members in attendance than people.

After two years of inactivity, during which time he returned to native
Ireland to ponder his musical direction and next career move, Gallagher
re-emerged recently with a new album, “Photo-Finish.” ,

Only his longtime bassist, fellow Irishman Gerry McAvoy, has been
retained from the old band lineup. Completing the new three-piece
Gallagher band is youthful Scottish drummer Ted McKenna, a longtime
member of the topsy-turvy Sensational Alex Harvey Band.

Gallagher's three-piece unit adds to the long list of guitarists sailing on
shaky commercial waters of late——such as Alvin Lee of Ten Years Later
and Kim Simmonds of Savoy Brown—who have returned to the
basic-power trio lineup. ‘

If anything, Gallagher’s return to basics serves as a type of defiance

0 toward. public indifference to his music. Instead of sweetening his

approach, Gallagher's three-piece attack on “Photo-Finish” is rawer
and more primal than justabout anything you’ll hear today.

The album maintains Gallagher’s love for blues-based rock, as
Gallagher cranks out the rockers like there is no tomorrow.

“Shin-kicker,” “Brute, Force and Ignorance,” “Shadowplay” and
“Photo-Finish” all exhibit his gritty and energetic slide guitar and
complex blu_es_leads, while his pleading, yet masculinegvoice rings with
conviction. ' ’ ' I

. ;,—.

' Gallagher is a man who certainly needs some sort of break if he is to _

catch on in America and match the super-star status he always ‘has
enjoyed in Ireland and Great Britian. ' _

Undoubtedly, with the release of “Photo-Finish,” he will be on tour
throughout’ the United. States _and opening -shows for acts who can’t
touch him as a performer or musician. ' I . '

The hard-working Gallagher has released quality musical products for
the last five years, and ' once people begin cleaning out their
disco-infected ears, Gallagher may emerge as a star, for he is one artist
who still believes in pulling music from his heart and guts. ‘

Super rockers Aerosjnlth, the hlghpolnt of the film “Sgt.1Pepper’s Lonely Hear-
ts Club Band,” will stop In at the civic Arena Nay. 9. ffhe band is currently on a
coast to coast tour. I - ' .

Wednesday, October 25, 1978—Page 15_

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt soccer team is sure to
have its hands full at Pitt Stadium
tonight when it meets the toughest
opponent of the season, the Nittany
Lions ‘of Penn State. Penn'State
has lost to only three teams this
year—Indi'ana, San Francisco, and
Hartwick—the top-rated teams in

the nation. .

Penn State is led by All-America

'7 candidate Jim Stamatis, a mid-

ﬁelder who has been considered for

“Sports  

Panther Boaters Certain To Find Nittanies

the Olympic team. A number of
Penn ‘State players have been
members of the Lehigh 1 Valley
all-star team alongwith Panthers
Mark and Karl Nigh‘ and‘ Jeff
Shireman.

“In the last three or four /years
Penn State has improved
immensely,” said Karl Nigh. “We
play well against‘ them at home
because we’re always _up' for‘ this
contest.” .

Another Lehigh Valley all-star,
Jeff Shireman, ‘sees ‘Penn ' States’

defense as exceptional, even
though it no longer has Matt Bahr.

“lf Penn ‘State has lost anything
from last season, it would be losing
Matt Bahr at fullback, who plays’
pro soccer, even though he is still
eligible to kick for their football
team,” said Shireman. “They still
have an excellent ‘defense and a
great amount of talent.” .

Under the tutelage of coach
Walter Bahr, Penn‘ State is well

versed the fundamentals of soccer ,

exhibited by Stamatis’ and‘ Ken

Olympic team.

McDonald’s tryout with the
McDonald is
considered to have a dangerous
head shot and a hard shot with
either foot. Another outstanding-
factor in the Penn State lineup is
goalie Danny Gallagher. Even in
losing to national powers.
Gallagher only’ has allowed one ‘or,
two goals to be scored.

Working with the regular rota-
tion, Pitt junior John Bonessi will
start the game in goal.

“This is the ﬁrst full season ‘I've
been able to play at Pitt,” said-

aﬂandful 2   ‘

Bonessi. -“I know Penn ‘State will
be the toughest team we’re going
to have to face this seasorriiribut I
think we’ll still be able to compete
against‘ them.’ ’

The Panthers, if they hope to
compete against‘ PennfState, must

cash in on their scoring opportuni-, 

ties, something they’ve failed to do
in the past. The Pitt defense also
must be ready to stop the powerful.

_ Game time for contest is set for 7
pm. Students‘ should enter Gate

     lmposter To Be Exposed in Annapolissaturday

Pitt News Staff Writer

It might be more appropriate if _it
were—a masquerade party instead of
a football game.

{Just as the endof the costume
gala’ signals the removal of the
masks; the f1nal'gun,in Saturday’s

is-gcontest between 15th-ranked Pitt

and 18th-ranked Navy at Annapolis
will remove the facade from a top
20 imposter. »
Navy, adorned with a 6-0 record,
brings the nation’s' most frugal
defense into’ the game, a unit, that
has allowed but 24 points this
season, ranks first in total defense,
ﬁrst in scoring defense (4.0 points
per game) and‘ second in both
rushing and ‘passing defense (71.2
and 72.2 yards per game, respect-

‘ ively).

Pitt stands at 5-1, is loaded with _

Florida State’s ﬂying‘circus out of
the end zone last Saturday.

Navy, however has run up its
impressive statistics against‘ ‘the
likes of Connecticut, Virgina ‘and’

William & Mary. Pitt, on the other ’

hand,‘ has shown tendencies of '
complete offensive and ' defensive

' breakdowns and has not defeated a

ranked team in the regular season
since 1976. Saturday’s game will
go a long’ way in determining‘

exactly what team is _deserving ‘of ,

what. .
“Maybe ur defense has played
well because we haven’t' played

7;5,good'offensive teams,” said Navy



coach George _Welch. _ “That
helps.” , .
“I couldn’t ask very much more
of our football teams, “Welch

team has yet to play four. solid
quarters of football. The defense

7 has had its moments‘and_'so has the

offense, but.-never has the two units
chosen the same, game for their
better performances. Turnovers
also have been a major problem,

» “We moved the 'ball against‘

Florida State, only’ we got rid of it

at the wrong times,” said Sherrill. ‘

“If not‘ for the turnovers, we would
have put 20 points‘ on the board.
Maybe we can put handles on the
ball or something.”’"

  Jackson Assumes Bench Role

« ByKARENKADILAK

Pitt News Staff Writer '
With Dave I)iCiccio scheduled to
return after sitting out a week with,
arm injuries, Ricky Jackson doesn't

expect another starting assignment

at defensive end, although he
excelled in Pitt’s 7-3 win over

Florida State. _
1 ‘ ‘No one’s really ‘discussed it with
me,” Jackson \said early this week.
‘ ‘I just kind of think Chico (DiCiccio)
is going to start.

‘ ‘He deserves it, ” the sophomore
said about DiCiccio. “He has more

‘ DiCiccio,

around ﬁve years, and l’ve been
here for two. He has more

That being the case, Jackson,

who made a team-high 14 ‘tackles.;,.

Saturday, doesn't mind playing
behind DiCiccio, although he
probably could start on many other
teams.

“No, it doesn't bother me,”
Jackson said. “I believe I’m one of
the best defensive players on the

”team._Ia ﬁgure’ I’ll get my chance

when Dave leaves.

“I don’t try to compare myself to
” Jackson continued. “I
believe I'm faster and more physical
than DiCiccio, but he’s way ahead of
me as far as experience
concerned.” -

Starting. his first game Saturday,

Jackson,‘ sacked‘, the ’ quarterback *

Sherrill explained the Panthers
sought to control the, ball against’
the Seminoles rather than try to
take advantage of Florida State’s
weak secondary.

“We tried to keep "the ball as-

much as we could instead of

‘ ‘I was up for Florida State, ’ ’ said
Jackson, a three-time all-state
selection at Pahokee High School in
Florida. “I had played with a lot of
their players in some high school
all-star games. I wanted to prove I

was the best.” 

According to the 6-foot-3, 210-
‘pound Jackson, team bragging
rights were also at stake. _

“I wanted to beatthem,” the
sophomore said. “When I go home,
I don’t want the people down there
saying we lost and that they had a
better team.’’ | «

Sherrill. “We didn't want to get
into a shoot-out with them; we

Although the Pitt offensive is

playing there. i‘ . '

“I didn't think they could win 
many games as Pitt, ” said J ackson.

Jackson can't wait until 1980, the
next time Pitt plays Florida State.
By then, he expects to be a full-time
starter.

“I want to show the folks 6‘a?k
home I can play,” he said. “I come,
from a pretty small high school,
with only about 80 in my graduating
class. No one’s really made it big in
football.”

V Meanwhile, Jackson plans _to
concentrate on the other Panther
opponents‘. ’ '

I

“I think I can do’; something in

every game to help this team win,’’. ,

said Jackson, who last season
intercepted two passes, one “of
which he returned for a touchdown.

In what was billed as the top
match of the young‘ season,
defending Western Pennsylvania
Intercollegiate Bowling Conference
champion Robert Morris fell to
undefeated and ﬁrst-place Pitt, 2-1.

In the ﬁrst game the teams
traded the lead throughout the ﬁrst
ﬁve frames with neither side
showing anyweaknesses. The
Presidents soon caught fire,

' though, as they ﬁred strike after‘

strike to take the lead’ and ‘coasted
to a 954-851 victory. Mitch Haber’s
212 and ‘ freshman Joe Nemetz’s

195 led the Panthers, while Don ,
‘Genalo led the Presidents‘ with a

225. .

Panther Mark Suekoff’s brilliant
236 and’ Nemetz’s -204 led the
Panthers in the second ‘game. Pitt
opened with an awesome barrage
of strikes and ‘held on to take the
second‘ game, 936-836. Robert
Morris closed the gap with a cluster
of striked of its own, but Pitt put on
the heat and took a 100-pin‘victory.

It was now one ‘game apiece with
Robert Morris holding ‘a slim 3-pin
lead. V - _

The game opened with some
consistent shooting ‘by both teams;
the lead seesawed. When the
Presidents‘ tried putting ‘Pitt away
with a barrage of strikes in the ﬁfth
and ' sixth frames, the Panthers

, stayed right with them and ‘threw .

’ Panthers,

their own ﬂurry. Goinginto the
10th and ﬁnalframe, the two teams
were dead even.

The teams’ ﬁrst bowlers each
missed his mark. It_was now down
to the ﬁnal‘ four bowlers on each
side. When Nemetz spared and the

,Presidents’ Dave Hinkes missed,

the Panthers took a one-mark lead.

Steve Fendler spared for the
and when the_

Presidents" Mark LaRosa missed
his shot, the Panthers gained a
two-mark lead. Coppedge and ‘the
President’s Dennis Quinn ‘both
spared, andwhen Suekoff struck
for the Panthers, the game was out
of reach, 872-837.

The Panthers averaged an

impressive 178 a game per man, ~

while Robert Morris averaged 176.

“We looked very sharp in all
three games today, especially the
second,” said Fendler. “Our team
showed a great deal of poise in
bouncing back after losing ‘the ﬁrst
game by 103 pins,"and this gave us
the momentum we needed for that
crucial third game. I believe we
have the ability to stay in first place

. and have a good chance of winning

the WPIBC title. ’ "

The Panthers’ next home match
will be Nov. 11 at Strand'Lanes.

Next week Pitt ventures to J

Duquesne.‘

Pantherettes Achieve

‘ ‘By CINDY NATALI

Pitt News Staff Writer ’

Optimism rings out in the

preseason voices of most coaches,

but few teams make it through their

seasons without some discrepancies

between prediction and perfor-
mance.

But the Pantherette tennis team

has shown strength to go with the *
‘ high expectations of coach, Nancy

Gordon and assistant coach Irma
Pytka. . .

“Everything is turning out about
what we thought,” Pytka said.
‘-‘We know exactly where we stand
with our team this year.”

The team demonstrated its power ,
7 throughout a busy week of ﬁve
" matches. Three wins improved its

record to 8-3. A -
Pitt lost both matches in a

triangular meet with Penn State and A

the University of Pennsylvania last

weekend but then triumphed over *

Slippery Rock, Cincinnati and
Northern Kentucky.

Despite the 7-2 loss at Penn State
and the 5-4 setback to Penn, Pytka
was pleased the matches were so
close against those power teams.

“Scores of many of the matches

- could have gone either way,” Pytka

said. \ ~ _
Maris Paris, Pitt’s top player,

4 provided the “real excitement of

the day,f ’ Pytka said, by overpower-
ing Penn State's top player, Joy
McManus, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, for the ﬁrst
time in their numerous meetings.

Still undefeated in singles this
year, Randi Belkin easily defeated
Joan Bachenstose to run her win to
11 matches.

The ﬁrst team of Paris and Jan
Decostro battled hard in both sets
before losing, 7-5, 7-5, to Gail
Ramsey and McManus. In third
doubles, LaFuria and Belkin
struggled for three sets but dropped
_a 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 match to Carol
Daniels and Bachenstose.

Penn nipped the Pantherettes in
doubles for its victory. The teams
tied in singles play, but a costly loss
in a close doubles match squelched
Pitt’s victory hopes. I

‘ ‘We have a very strong first four
singles, but ourstrength drops after
that,” Pytka‘ said. _

But Pitt didn’t need to battle hard
to register an 8-0-1 win over visiting

 Preseason Expectations  

Slippery Rock ‘I last Wednesday.
Darkness forced a draw in the fifth
singles match. Jan Brownstein and
Cathy Echendorf had split sets, 6-4,
.5-7, when play was called.

The Pantherettes competed with
two schools for the first time on last
weekend's road trip. Pitt swept

- every singles match from Cincinnati
Vto'w-in 8-1 last Saturday. 7

“They’re just building their
team,” Pytka said. ' “.They have
young talent and some nice players,
but they need work. They have a
new coach who is‘ doing a lot with
the team.” "

In singles play, Paris downed '

Pitt overpowered Northern Ken-

matches went beyond two sets.

In singles, Paris crushed Pam
Reeves, 6-1, 6-3. Decostro beat
Annette Fischer, 6-4, 6-0. Belkin
shutout Joni -Pilli, 6-0, 6-0, and
LaFuria downed Christy Kappes,
6-1, 6-1. Brownstein defeated Kris
Odor, 6-1, 7-5. Thesole singles loss

came when Lori Brandewai beat -

Weinberg, 7-6, 6-1.

'- Pitt changed its doubles teams
around for the match. In ﬁrst
doubles, . ‘LaFuria ‘and Decostro
swamped Reeves and Fischer, 6-3,
6-3. Aloe and Mazocca won, 6-1,
6-2. ’

“They (Aloe and'Mazocca) were
really supposed to be third, but we
put them in second to give them
stronger competition,” Pytka said.
“They played well."’

Pitt plays its ﬁnal match at
Maryland tomorrow and Pytka
expects a tough match.

“We’re not exactly sure how

. that’s going to turn out,” she said.

By The Associated Press

NEW Y0_RK—Gaylord Perry, the
A ' 40-year-old right-hander for the San
Diego Padres, became the ﬁrst

' pitcher to win the Cy Young Award_

in’ -both leagues when he easily
captured the National League honor
yesterday.
The Baseball Writers Association
of America, announced the result,
which came from the voting of two
of its members in each of the NL
cities. And it was a landslide for

Perry, the oldest winner ever of the.

coveted pitching award.

Perry, the only pitcher named on
all 24 ballots, received 10 ﬁrst-place
votes and a pair of runner-up
ballots. The ﬁve-three-one point

system gave him 116 points, far
outdistancing Burt Hooton of Los

Angeles,‘who had 38 points, Vida
Blue of S Francisco, with 17
points, an J. R. Richard of

- Houston, with 13 points.

Blue and Richard each picked up
a ﬁrst-place»vote and were followed
in the balloting by relief pitcher
Kent Tekulve of Pittsburgh (12
points), Phil Niekro of Atlanta (10),
Ross Grimsiey of Montreal (7),
reliever Rollie Fingers of San Diego
(1), ‘Tommy John of I.os Angeles (1)
and rookiej Don Robinson of
Pittsburgh (1). _
4 Perry, 21-6, topped the 20-victory
mark for the ﬁfth time in his
magniﬁcent career that stretches

back to his major league debut with

the San Francisco Giants in 1962.
He has also won 19 games twice and
18 games once.

Perry, ‘whose NL record is
155-115 and American League_mark
112-91, led the Padres to their best
season ever, a fourth-place ﬁnish in
the NL West with a record of 84-78.
Perry also has pitched for Cleveland
and Texas in the AL. His other Cy
Young Award came in 1972, when
he was 24-16 for Cleveland.

The 1972 award came in his first
year with the Indians after he was
traded by the Giants. The Cy Young
trophy he picked up yesterday also
came the ﬁrst year following a
trade.

The Texas Rangers, who acquir-
ed the 6-4, 215-pound pitcher from
Cleveland during the 1975 season,
apparently felt his best years were
behind him, dealing the ageless
wonder to San Diego for pitcher

Perry admitted in his autobio-

his Cleveland years, that he once
threw a greaseball, but maintains
now—with a smile, of course—that
he throws a mean forkball. He says
he’s glad the opposition thinks he

7 Coach and AD Posts   J

By The Associated Press

COLLEGE STATION, Texas-
Texas A & M head football .coach
and athletic director Emory Bellard
who reached the saturation point
with the alumni grumblingabout
his program, "resigned yesterday
although he had the best record in
the Southwest Conference the last
seven years. A

Bellard, the father of the
Wishbone-‘T and one of- the
strongest recruiters of schoolboy
football talent in the‘country, gave
no _ reason for his ‘shocking
resignation.

He had his resignation statement
read to the team, then went ‘into’
immediate seclusion in his office.
Offensive coordinator Tom Wilson
was named the interim head coach
and associate athletic director
Marvin Tate was promoted to
interim athletic director.

Even Bellard’s wife, Mary Kay,

didn’t known Bellard was resign_- »

mg. . ,
“The ﬁrst I heard about it was
today...l guess he just reached a
saturation point with all ’ the
unhappy alumni”
Bellard. x

Aggie Trainer Billy Pickard said.
“The players _are in shock. They»
loved Emory and ‘played for him as
hard as they could. Injuries to key
personnelkept them from perform-
ingat their best. The coaching
staff and ‘the head coach gave all
they could give. It just didn-’_t work
out. The football gods just didn’t
look down on it. '

“The kids love Tom, too. He’s a
wonderful man and ‘a great fello_w.

‘‘I’m happy that«we’re winning,
and I’m happy we're doing it with"

T

said Mrs.

He’s not a bit happy now. Of
course, every assistant coach
aspires to be a head coach. lt’s an
unfortunate set of circumstances.”
Ironically, Wilson was a finalist
for the Texas Tech job last year.
He was beaten out by Rex Dockery.
Despite an overall record of 7‘
48-27, Bellard failed to please the
highly vocal Aggie alumni ‘who
wanted a Cotton Bowl caliber club.
The grumbling‘ became louder ‘~

after the Aggies lost to the Houston 

Cougars 33-0 and the Baylor Bears
24-6 the last two weeks. In both
games, the Aggies failed to score a
touchdown.

Just two weeks ago the’ Aggies
were the No. 6 ranked team in the
nation. A _’ ﬂ ’ '

, Rumors swept the Aggie campus
after Bellard failed to _show for his
noon press conference. Sports
information director Spec Gammon
also coi1ldn’1 be found. .

In his announcement, Bellard
said, ‘ ‘Under existing ‘circumstanc-
es, I feel that it is best that I resign

my position a's'director of athletics 

and head football coach at Texas
A&M University.’

“Texas A&M is » a great
university and ‘will. always have a
special place in my heart. To all of
the ‘great people who have
supported our program, I say thank
you- for your loyalty and‘ friend-' '
ship.”

The»Aggies were 4-2 for the year
after opening with resounding
victories over Kansas, Boston
College, Memphis State and ‘Texas
Tech.

-so many young people, but we’re

going ‘to have to put one big game
together offensively and defens-
ively this week,” said Sherrill.

‘ “This could be a very opportun-
istic week for us,” Sherrill
continued. 7 “If we can put some
things together we’ll have a chance
to get into the picture of a lot of
things.”
