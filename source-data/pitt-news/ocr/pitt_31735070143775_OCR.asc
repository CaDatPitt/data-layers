Friends remember professor

by Angela Reno '
For t/ac Pitt Ne wa

Fifteen students gathered in 15_O1 Posvar
Hall last night to remember Pitt professor Keiko
McDonald, who’ died last weekend. ‘

A small group of McDonald’s students
gathered in her usual classroom to watch the
movies she showed, including “Madadayo”
and f‘MacArthur’s Children,” and to take turns
sharing their favorite memories of her.

‘‘We’re doing this because»
we love her,” said Pitt senior ‘ ‘
Mark Prascak. She_ was a .
“unique individual, always
loving and giving, and she
always put her students
ﬁrst.” .

The students who gathered
in Posvar made up just a
small percentage of the lives
she touched. In her 36 years‘
at Pitt, McDonald, who was

We're doing this
because we love

‘ ‘her.

4 Mark.
Prascak

Before the ‘movies were shown, students V
spoke about McDonald’s kind spirit, big smile,

_ warm personality and loving nature.

They said she was a down—to—earth individual.
They also reminisced about her wildly colored
wardrobe, speciﬁcally the bright sneakers she
wore to class. i ' -

Per her request, her students called her Keiko,_
not Professor McDonald. ,Many of them said
she was more than a teacher:_»Sfhe was a friend. _

Gautamjayanthi, a senior who had McDonald

~e _ as an adviser, said that McDonald"
“had a magnetism about her.”
She was “so full of life.”

_ Most of the ﬁlms McDonald
showed in her classes highlighted
teacher—student ‘relationships,
which she fostered throughout
her career. ’ ‘

One of‘ those movies was
' , “The Last Samurai.”

 A former student

- teaching assistant,
Taper, compared McDonald’s

I

and

the chairwoman of the East
Asian Studies Department,
taught thousands of students,

many of whom sent letters, ﬂowers and notes.

"of remembrance. An informal memorial sits in
the East Asian Studies Department. A _
Sympathy cards have been sent from places as
far as Japan, where many of her former students
, either work or study. g_ V. ‘
According to her teaching assistants,

McDonald supported her students by writing‘

.letters of recommendation to help them study
abroad and further their knowledge of Japanese
culture and cinema. _— -

_ ._ she used to describe it. He said,
“The cherry ~blossorn represents the ‘samurai

because it was fragile, here for a few hours and
then blown away. She was likeja cherryiblossom.

She was here, and thenfshe left.” _ b V

The University. has tentatively scheduled
a formal memorial service for McDo_n'ald in

Football

Hawkeyes attempt to prey

by Emily Steiner
Staﬁ’ IV/‘its/'

Comingoff acrucial victoryagainst
Buffalo two weeks ago, the Pitt football
team resumes action tomorrow at
noon at Heinz Field against the Iowa
Hawkeyes 0

Thanks to an off week last
weekend, the Panthers (1 -1) had plenty
of time to prepare for the challenge of
 their only Big Ten opponent of

Iowa head coach Kirk Ferentz,

it has not yet allowed a touchdown

Pitt victory necessary to recapture momentum

by Zack Chakan
Adazlitzz/zt Sparta E9it0r

   

In a 12-game college football
season, every outcome is
signiﬁcant.

But Pitt’s showdown with Iowa
tomorrow could have the same
effect on its 2008 campaign that
its opponent’s home state usually
yields for political primaries.

If the Panthers fall at Heinz
Field yet again, they might as well
drop out of the Big East race.

A Now with a record of 1-1,
Dave. Wannstedt’s team was

‘smoked - at home by Bowling

Green in its opener three weeks
ago. -

It appeared after the defeat
that the loss may not have
been so bad, until the Falcons
subsequently lost to Minnesota

(possibly the worst team in the
Big Ten) and Boise State.

Pitt rebounded to beat
Buffalo, but the opening loss
makes the Iowa contest even
more important.

If Pitt loses to the Hawkeyes
and drops to 1-2, then future
games on the schedule won’t
look as winnable as previously
believed.

Iowa is a middle-of-the-
road Big Ten squad at best. It is
undefeated at 3-0, but two of those
victories were demolitions of
Maine and Florida International
— not exactly Michigan and
Florida.-

Then the Hawkeyes struggled
to put away Iowa State last week,
scoring two fourth-quarter
touchdowns to win. One of those
scores came on a punt return.

Iowa has a quality running
back in 5—foot-11-inch, 235-
pound Shonn Greene. Greene
already has tallied 359 yards on
only 55 carries, but he’s the only
positive of the Hawkeye offense.

The team hasn’t settled, on
a quarterback, with both Jake
Christensen and Ricky Stanzi
laboring to succeed. If Iowa
wants to score, it will go through
Greene.

Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz was
a hot up-and-comer in 2004,
after leading his team to three
consecutive 10-win seasons.
Since then, the Hawkeyes have
only won 22 games.

Ferentz, who was considered
for NFL jobs leading into 2005,
runs a pro-style of football that is
similar to that of Wannstedt. As a
result, don’t expect many points

in this game, especially with the
limited number of offensive
weapons on Ferentz’s side.

But Pitt does have those
weapons. LeSean McCoy lacks
a 100-yard game on his 2008
resume, which is all the more
reason to expect a breakout.
Derek Kinder and Nate Byham
have been under-utilized.
Jonathan Baldwin hasn’t caught a
pass yet.

The artillery is there, so now .

the Panthers have to use it.

As unfortunate as it seems,
this game may come down to the
battle in the trenches. On both
sides of the line, Iowa contains
big and strong players, while
Pitt features leaner and quicker
athletes. 0

If the Hawkeyes stack the box
and overpower Pitt’s offensive

line, McCoy might have another
long day. If the Panthers assert
themselves, however, they could
pile on the points and go on
cruise control..

Over the past two years, Pitt
lost early affairs to .Michigan
State, a different Big Ten foe, but
one with a similar formula as the
Hawkeyes. Those losses proved
that Pitt wasn’t ready enough or
good enough to be a consistent
winner.

With one simple victory
tomorrow, in front of what
should be another decent crowd
and against a less-talented
opponent, the Panthers would
make a speedy turn back on the

Cathedral Cafe

Location: Cathedral of Learning, Ground
Floor

Hours: Monday-Thursday, 10:30 a.m. — 6
p.m.

Friday 10:30 a.m. — 3 p.m.

Saturday and Sunday: Closed

What You Get: Sushi, Chick-ﬁl-A sand-
wiches, salads and deli foods

Kelsey Says:

Cathedral Cafe is perfect for grab-
bing lunch between classes with friends,
but the Cathedral can get pretty crowded
at lunchtime. The prices are relatively
high, but overall the Cathedral is one of
the better on—campus places for eating.

I got a chicken quesadilla from Home-
town Favorites for lunch. In retrospect,
asking for the chemically “enhanced”
chicken may have been a mistake. Like al-
most all places on campus, the meat was
just OKand pretty greasy. Next time I’d
go for the vegetable quesadilla because the
cheese and tortilla were good and grilled

fresh. .Made with fresh peppers and onions,
it looked tasty, too.

Noah Says:

Where could you expect to ﬁnd a caf-
eteria with fried chicken, customizable
sandwiches and sushi in the basement of a
humongous skyscraper-castle? Sodexo has
invaded the ground of the Cathedral! The
Cathedral Cafe is hit or miss. Sometimes
you can ﬁnd enough Chick—ﬁl—A and Tsu-
nami Sushi to feed an army;other times you
must scavenge for a scrap of fried breading.

The sushi is what most people come for
and what I decided to purchase, although
I’d just as much rather go to Sushi Boat on
Atwood for better quality and less money.
Yet, one thing that wound me up was when
I got a cup for water, the staff charged me
for a cup of ice  even if there was no ice.
The charge is a quarter, which adds up to
maybe a dollar a week. In 40 weeks, that’s
40 dollars. I’m no math major, but college
is already costly as it is. Don’t charge me for
my water cup.

Kelsey Says:

For healthy eaters, The Schenley Cafe
probably isn’t your place of choice. Three
of the main places to eat are an express
Pizza Hut, a smoothie and ice cream sta-
tion and Strutters, which features fried
chicken, fried chicken sandwiches, fried
chicken wings and fried potatoes. There’s
also a Sub Connection where you can get
sandwiches, as well as the Culinary Clas-
sics, which has a variety of Asian food,
pastas and other “home—style” foods.

chicken (which I later discoveredwas sup-
posed to be General Tso’s) with fried rice
and an egg roll. The chicken was fried and
covered in an inherently delicious sweet
sauce, but the fried rice was tasteless and
bland. And, alas, the egg roll was sad and

SOggy.

Noah Says:

The thing about Pizza Hut is that no
matter what you get, it’ll be so greasy that it
will melt in your mouth. Not that I’m say-
ing that’s a bad thing, but if you’re wary of
the fabled Freshman 15, then Pizza Hut is
going to scare the crap out of you. Still, hit-
ting up Freshens to get a smoothie (one of
the healthy ones, not the super awesome ice
cream and Kool-Aid with cherries smooth-
ie) could balance you out. Don’t forget
about Culinary Classics —— it’s the Univer-
sity’s hidden Chinese food spot on campus.
Sub Connection is a faux Subway, except its
subs are so soaked in Italian dressing that
you just might drown in vegetable oil.

The Perch takes the best of Market Central

chicken sandwich much more enjoyable
than the Chick—ﬁl—A chain. The sandwich
was messy, messy, messy, but it tasted like
it’d been made with love.

The Perch at Sutherland

Location: Sutherland Hall, Upper Level
Hours: Monday—Friday 5 p.m.—9 p.m.
Saturday & Sunday: 10 a.m.—3 p.m., 4
p.m.—_9 p.m.

What You Get: Soup, salad, sandwiches,
dinner-related Food, Asian cuisine and
steak fries

Kelsey Says:

Sometimes second time is the charm, or
at least that’s the case with Sodexo’s new-
est dining facility, The Perch at Sutherland.
Market Central’s new little sibling has many
of the same characteristics: a sandwich sta-
tion, a diner with burgers and grilled chicken
and a station with daily changing cuisines.

» As similar as the two may be, I think
The Perch has one—upped Market Central
with better food, a lot of choices and better
ice cream ﬂavors. But don’t get too excited.
The Perch has horrible hours. It’s only open
from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays, and let’s
be honest here: Most college students aren’t

exactly going to bed at 10 p.m., so students
on Upper Campus only have Sutherland?s
Quick Zone for late night pangs of hunger.

For dinner, I had the Freshno Pita Pock-
et from Matos. It had red pepper hummus,
provolone cheese and vegetables inside a
fresh pita. It was healthy and tasted like real
food — not something you can always get
from on—campus cafeterias.

Noah Says:

Sutherland really does have it better:
nice, open rooms with a commanding view
of Oakland, the basketball courts and swim-
ming pool of Trees Hall right next door,
big red roofs and steak fries. Yes, steak fries.
The Perch at Sutherland has taken the best
of Market Central and combined it into a
smaller room with a smaller crowd.

You can get whatever you want, usually
without a 10 or 15 minute wait. You want a
cheeseburger? Barn, you got it. Asian noo-
dles? Whoosh, here they are. Steak fries?
Not only are they ready for you, but they
are just waiting to be taken in a bin sitting
on the counter. No waiting for steak fries.
It’s a dream come true.

And though some of the Asian cuisine
is so—so cafeteria food, if you’re willing to

Market Central

Location: Lobby of Litchfield Towers
Hours: Varies by station, but most open
past midnight

What You Get: Anything you’d want from
an aIl—you—can—eat, restaurant—style buffet/
cafeteria  although anything can get old
after a week or two

Kelsey Says:

MC, Market, Marke or whatever you call
it, Market Central is the ﬂagship of Sodexo’s
facilities. It’s got plenty of options for every-
one. The quality isn’t quite up to scratch with
some other on-campus dining facilities, and
it’s always freezing down there, but there are
a lot of options to satisfy your craving until
2 a.m. when the Flying Star Diner closes.

I went the healthy route and had stir~fry
from the 360 Degrees Grill, my personal
favorite, and a salad from Tutto Fresco.
The veggies were fresh and tasty, but the
texture of the rice was a bit odd. The salad
bar had a nice selection, though they were

which led to a mild scuffle over the dress-
ing. Overall, however, my dinner was nice
and healthy.

Noah says: .

Ah, the creme dela creme, the place
where they herd all the freshmen to graze:
Market Central. You could practically sur-
vive off Market food for your entire life if
you have no set standards. I mean, if you’re
accustomed to an enormous home—cooked
meal, Market Central will make you cry
tears of sadness. But if you can’t even ﬁnd
non—expired milk at your real home, then
step right up; Market’s for you.

We’re all trying to maintain a healthy life-
style, so there’s a salad bar in the back, but to
get to the peas and cucumbers you have to
go under the sneeze-guard and reach your
way to the back. What also makes Market
unique is the 360 Degrees Grill, where you
can pick whatever you want from the grill,
and it’ll be fried up for you.

On the other hand, I chose to go all out
and accept the fact that I am gaining 15
pounds this semester. You can stock up on
cheeseburgers, pasta, pizza and french fries.
That’s the way to stay in shape.

Whether you’re sick of Market Central,
awake studying late at night or just have no
time to sit down to eat between classes, it’s in-
evitable: You’re going to need groceries.

Now, where can you ﬁnd a store that sells
groceries? For most students  on cam-
pus, it comes down ‘to two main options: the
Quick Zone convenience store next to Market
Central and the IGA grocery store on Forbes
Avenue.

The grocery boasts a wide ‘selection of
edibles and a variety of bath products, over-
the-counter medicines and paper goods, but
its location, roughly three blocks away from
the Towers lobby, makes it slightly more of a
trek for students  in Schenley Quad or Li-
tchﬁeld Towers. This is especially true for the
Towers folk, as the Quick Zone can be reached
from the dorm’s lobby without going outdoors
— a luxury in typical Pittsburgh weather.

While both stores accept Panther Funds, I

the Quick Zone will also accept  dollars
from the Pitt meal plan. ’ '

“I don’t use Panther Funds or cash usu-
ally, so 1 either shop with Dining Dollars at the
Quick Zone or at the dollar store,” said fresh-
man Mike Woodhull.

 

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

Vuick stops face off

Dining Dollars are only usable at campus-
owned facilities and can be difﬁcultto get rid
of by the end of the semester, so being able to
use them on provisions is convenient

"I don’t know that much about the Quick
Zone for groceries. I usually only go there to
get a salad or sandwich for lunch or some-
thing,” said freshman Paulina Gonzales.

In terms of ambiance, the Quick Zone is
very much grab and go, whereas IGA encour-

ages customers to linger over those important‘

gustatory decisions. And while the University
does represent a large percentage of its pa-

tronage, IGA shoppers, as opposed to Quick .

Zone-ers, are not exclusively students.

Comparing the pricing of basic items
shows that the Quick Zone tends to be more
expensive than IGA for most edible items,
though many students living independently for
the ﬁrst time are surprised and aghast at how
expensive g_roceries_,are everywhere.

The same half gallon of milk will cost $3.09
at the Quick Zone and $1.88 at IGA. Easy -_Mac
Ready Serve, a staple component of the aver-
age college diet; can be obtained for only 99
cents at IGA, as opposed to the $1.39 at the

Quick Zone. Cereals such as Cheerios are 50 _

cents less at IGA. Single servings of yogurt
cost $1.59 at the Quick Zone and 83 cents at

IGA.

The Quick Zone does have IGA beat on

cookies at 33 cents (averaging 45 cents at IGA)

- andsome fruits (79 cents at Quick Zone, 99
cents at IGA), but in general, Pitt students,

wanting convenience  have to" pay for it
Even still, there are those who find the com-
paratively cheaper IGA to be pncey.

“I went to IGA once, but it seemed pretty

expensive, so I don’t think I’ll go backj’ said

’ freshman Sam Becker when asked where she
preferred to shop. “I don’t reallyilike the Quick
Zone either, though. I’d rather go to Target if‘

the Waterfront wasn’t so far away.”

So while there are options abound for
groceries in Pittsburgh, if you want to stick
in Oakland, take a risk and walk three blocks.
Your bank account will thank you.

Be it busyness or laziness, let’s face
the facts: Sometimes, you need to eat a
microwave dinner.

Thousands of students eat microwave
dinners every night. As a service to- our
readers, I decided to let The'Pitt News
pay for my dinners for six nights under

the condition that every night, I sampled —

p a different brand of microwave dinner.
Anything for a good story.

To make this study scientiﬁc, I sam-
pled the same basic meal —— macaroni and
cheese — from each competitor. While
tasting, I evaluated the dishes on an ar—
ray of criteria including deliciousness,
healthiness (or lack thereof), how ﬁlling
the food is andvthe length and complexity
of the “cooking” procedure.

The purposeiof this study was to ﬁnd .

the best mac—and-cheese microwave meal
on the market, although ‘the journey was
just as fulﬁlling as the destination.

While I had never

_ heard of Amy’s Mac-

hope that its organ-
ic ingredients.would
soothe my increas-
ingly angered arter-
ies led me to buy this mysterious meal.
With virtually all ingredients prefaced by
the word “organic,” I couldn’t help but
feel semi-healthy as I ate my meal, un-
til a glance at the nutrition facts changed
my mind: 410 calories for 255 grams of
food, compared to Lean Cuisine’s 290
calories for slightly more food.
While I found solace in the fact that I
could ﬁnd most of the ingredients in my

 

refrigerator, the finished product fasted

no more impressive than anything else
found there. Call me crazy for expecting
a frozen dinner to not taste like a fro-

zen dinner, but many of the other mac.

a moment to reminisce on the cheese’s
thin, watery texture and lack of taste.

my stomach full, I still felt empty on the

will get as close to an authentic City of

you can find everything from Italian sau-
sage sandwiches and fresh salads to more
interesting between—the—buns fare, such
as the vegetarian-friendly Vegetable Flo-

onions, tomatoes and melted provolone.

which the norm is a 22 oz. mug of frosty ale.
Skip those puny pints —— Gene’s 22’s are not
only huge, but also impressively affordable.
Add to the mix the bar’s tiny, hole-in-the-
wall nature, the competitive darts games that
often erupt out of nowhere and the fact that

Peter’s Pub is Oakland’s quintessential col-

scene in Peter’s. There are enough tables
that one’s almost always open to grab a
seat and share a pitcher with some friends,
more than decent bar food and good times
all around. Ever seen someone staggering
through Oakland wearing a Viking hat? Well
you should’ve wished him a happy 215‘ birth-
day — Peter’s rewarded him with the subtle
cap that seems to say, “I’m legal now. Will
you buy me my 19* shot.” And Peter’s is the
closest Oakland gets to a real live rock club
—— the bar regularly features live music and
themed dance nights on the second ﬂoor.
Nobody loves Pitt like Peter’s.

bar room. A big, rectangular bar greets you,
and the cold air rushing in from the open

up your drink, walk further into room num-
ber two. See that stage? Stop by on a Tuesday
night for one of the most ridiculous and fun
karaoke nights out there. Keep on truckin’
to room number three and you’ve got some
bar staples: two pool tables and the bath-

V extra yummy sushi in his Oakland restaurant.

Despite having a Forbes Avenue

4 address,--Taiwan Cafe is one of the four

Asian restaurants" on Oakland Avenue.
An almost secret—looking ﬂight of stairs
under the ‘ yellow awning on Oakland
leads down into a large basement dining
area. And for those older than 21, the
restaurant boasts a large selection of

six packs and 40s to go. Along with the

typical American domestic beers, Taiwan
Cafe also has imports, like Tsing Tsao.

Friendly faces greet Asian food lovers  

The menu is very basic, and it
doesn’t have nearly as much choice as, say,
Szechwan Express. Don’t worry, though,
you can still find traditional Asian dishes
like 10 mein, as well as some curry dishes
and Taiwan rice noodles. They also serve
tasty milk and green teas with tapioca
pearls, as well as smoothies and specialty
milkshake smoothies. ’

The ﬁrst floor consists of a

bar looking onto the street, two tables .

(more upstairs) and a small sushi bar. The

upstairs is similar to Sushi Boat’s eat—in_

section. Oishii Bento literally translates

to “yummy lunchbox” in Japanese, a

name that accurately reflects the fare.

Klavons hearkens back to a better ice cream past

by Halyse Domencic
Staff)" Wrz'terr

Everyone remembers their first

time.
b Except for me. My memory was
i wiped about ﬂve or six years ago.
Having my first sundae at Klavon’s Ice
Cream Parlor drove my first experience
with ice cream into the ground like a
ﬂaming meteorite.
I can say that I never enjoyed ice cream
’ until I delved deep into what Klavon’s had
' to offer.

My fascination began when my
oldest sister and my dad argued about how
to say “Klavon’s.” My dad insisted it was

_. “klay-vins,” but my sister was certain it was
“kluh-vawn.” My brother—in—law would
often tease my dad, telling him he sounded
like Professor Frink from The Simpsons.
HOYVIN-GLAVIN!!

I quickly learned, however, that
in the realm of ice cream, Klavon’s — no

matter how it’s pronounced —— is king.
Over the hill and through the
Strip District, the little ice cream parlor,
located at 2801 Penn Ave., is a delicious,
o1d—fashioned slice of Pittsburgh. Brightly

colored plastic chairs, neon signs and
balloons attract the attention of curious
customers.

Those who enter the parlor are
treated to a delightful spectacle. Art Deco
lamps, antique phone booths and even a tin
ceiling, along with toys and knick—knacks
from the ’20s and ’30s, decorate the shop. .

Customers can sit in wooden
booths or tables in the middle of the
store. For an old—fashioned feel, there’s
also a marble counter with stools made
to look like Coca—Cola bottle caps. Sitting
here gives customers the best view of the
parlor.

The menu offers plenty of variety.
Klavon’s stocks Hershey’s and Reinhold’s
ice cream ﬂavors, including some that
are lactose and sugar—free. Plus, there are
multiple syrups and even whipped creams.
Customers can order classics such as
the Tin Ceiling Sundae or a banana split
called The Strip District Split. Or they
can break the mold by creating their own

_ combinations.

The number of ﬂoats, milkshakes, egg
creams, malts and sodas only support the
conclusion that if something can be done
to ice cream, Klavon’s will do it.

PLAZA

Daring ice cream fans can get
their picture taken and posted on the wall,
but not before finishing the eight~scoop,
topping—drenched Super Bowl Sundae.

If ice cream isn’t for you, the
shop serves fresh deli sandwiches daily, as
well as soups and salads.

No matter your choice, you
are sure to be greeted by one of the
eight Klavon siblings. Audrey, Geraldine,
Gloria, Jane, Jimmy, Mark, Mary Ellen
and Raymond all take turns behind the
counter.

“If you got Klavon’s blood in
you, you work,” said the oldest sister, Mary
Ellen.

Raymond, who sports small-
framed glasses and a handlebar mustache,
taught in Pittsburgh public schools for 30
years. He retired eight years ago, but the ice
cream parlor always held a special place in
his heart.-

“He dreaded going back to
school after the summer because he loved
Klavon’s so much,” said Audrey.

The shop is deeply rooted in the
family, and second—oldest sibling Raymond
will fill customers in on it. '

was a drugstore owned and operated by
Pitt Pharmacy School alumnus james
Klavon and his wife Mary, the siblings’
grandparents.

“It wasn’t unusual for drugstores
to sell ice cream in that time,” said
‘Raymond. “So there were coolers and
syrup pumps.”

On St. Patrick’s Day, March 17,
1936, Pittsburgh experienced the worst
ﬂood it ever weathered. The ﬂood caused
water levels to rise almost 46 feet. A plaque
on the shop’s ceiling marks how high the
water rose.

The family lacked the money to restock
prescriptions and boarded up the shop.

“When our grandfather died in
1979, we weren’t sure what to do with it.
We always played here as kids, but there
was nothing left at this end of the Strip,”
said Raymond.

Beneath the sewage stains
and dust, however, all the old ice cream
equipment remained.

“W/ell, none of us are pharmacists,
and there’s no competing with pharmacies
like Rite Aid,” said Raymond. “The
equipment was all here: freezers, syrup
pumps, everything. Everything is authentic,

In January 1999, Klavon’s
reopened, but not without its problems.

Two days after being featured in a
local newspaper, the Klavons were forced
to dispose of the prescriptions leftover
from the shop’s pharmacy days.

“Look at this one: sedative
number two,” said Raymond, holding up an
empty glass bottle. “The main ingredient is
cannabis.”

They called Richard Lithko of
the Pitt School of Pharmacy to help them
discard what they could. The remaining
prescriptions, including things like a drug
called strychnine, which causes muscular
convulsions that can lead to death from
exhaustion, were donated to the School of
Pharmacy.

Bottles, tools other
pharmaceutical items remain on display
in some of Klavon’s many glass cases.

Cone, and this is the scoop that made it,”
said Raymond, pointing to a picture and
then the ice cream scoop he has on display.
“The scoop was hard for quality control, so
it was removed in the ’60s but stayed in the
main store in Oakland.”

“I was talking to Mrs. Isaly one day, and
she told me one of the managers put some
of the scoops in a landfill and another into
poured concrete. So, they were thrown
and scattered all over the place. One day,
a friend of the family bought a bunch
of scrap metal, and this scoop was at the
bottom.”

Audrey said the scoops begin
selling at $700 on eBay.
