I Pitt Researcher Feared Dead In Crash

 

By PEGGY FERRI

A University of _ Pittsburgh
researcher was among those pas-
sengers killed yesterday when Soviet
fighters shot down a Korean Air-
lines jet off the eastern Soviet coast.

Chung Soo Yoo, an adjunct pro-
fessor in the School of Pharmacy,
was on his way to South Korea to
teach a university seminar on crys-
tallography, his area of expertise. It
was his work in this area that led to
his invitation to teach in South
Korea. V .

Yoo’s colleagues were shocked by
the news of his death.

“He [Yoo} was one of the leaders

in this research,” Pitt pharmacy pro-

fessor Dr. Donald Abraham said at",
a press conference yesterday. “He

was an energetic scientist and well-
liked. A
“He was very warm,” he added.

Yoo, 46, was born in) Seoul,

’ Korea. He later became an Ameri-

can citizen. He was married and had
one daughter. His widow, Sung-
Wha Yoo, did not issue any
comment. '

Abraham knew Yoo when he was
an undergaduate in the 1960s and
later when Yoo became involved
with research at Pitt and in the Vete-
rans Administration hospital. A

Much of Yoo's work as a research
chemist was concentrated in crystal-
lography and the study of anti-
bodies and proteins. Yoo received
his doctorate from the university in
1971.

In a statement issued yesterday,
Chancellor Wesley Posvar said,

V ‘Months of discussion, count-
less interviews, stacks of vitae
and a search committee's recom-
mendations have ended with the
selection of Pitt's new provost.

Chancellor Wesley ‘W. Posvar
has named Dr. Roger Benjamin,
associate dean ' and executive
officer of the College of Liberal
Arts at the University of Minne-
sota, senior vice-chancellor and
provost at Pitt.

Benjamin replaces Rhoten
Smith, who retired from his post
June 30 after 12 years as provost

. at Pitt. Benjamin will assume his
duties here in October after com-
pleting his work at Minnesota.

The selection ended a process,

that began last December with
the selection of a l2-member
search committee that included
both elected and appointed
members as well as graduate and
undergraduate student repre-
sentatives.

The search committee
reviewed the applications of over
100 candidates—one-third of
which were seriously investi-

There is a bill stalled in the
U.S. Senate subcommittee. that
has some Pitt students and
‘ administrators nervous about its
implications if it’s not passed by
the full Congress by December.
One person in particular, Kar-
rie Budzinski, student agent for
the College of General Studies, is
concerned about the bill and has
initiated measures to ensure its

passage.

Senate Bill -249, or the
Employee Educational Exten-
sion Act (Taxation on Tuition
Assistance), will place a morato-
rium on the taxation of tuition
assistance by the federal govern-
ment if passed by Dec. 31.

“Right now, we’re. taking
action for it to get through the
subcommittee,”V_Budzinsky said.
“Then it has to get through the
senate committee, the full Senate
and finally, through the House
by the end of the 98th Congress."-

Currently, students who

companies such as Westinghouse
or PPG Industries, do not have
to pay taxes on the amount of
assistance they receive. If S249
dies, they will have to begin pay-
ing taxes on that assistance
beginning in January 1984.

Because there is a large major-
ity of evening students who do
receive tuition assistance from
the companies they work for, this
will be ‘a financial burden and
some will also be taxed.

For example, an undergradu-
ate student‘ who has a parent

,'velling is a shocking international

incident,” Posvar said. “It indicates

either incompetence or lack of disci- ’

pline for proper restraint by Soviet
armed forces in carrying out their
routine border surveillance.”

According to reports, the South
Korean jet was en route from New
York to Seoul. The jet violated
Soviet air space and was then
downed by a missile.

Dr. Jonathan Harris, a Pitt asso-
ciate professor of political science
whose concentration is the Soviet
Union, said he was surprised by the
incident. '

The area holds great military sig-
nificance for the Soviet Union, Har-
ris said, but the action of shooting
down a civilian plane is an extreme
overreaction.

“I ‘don’t think the Soviet side has
engaged inwan act of provocation.”

gated—before making its final
recommendation of five to the
chancellor.

“I’m very pleased with [the
selection],” Sarah Thomason,
associate professor of linguistics
and member of the committee
said. “I think we are very fortu- ,
nate to have him [Benjamin].”

Posvar described Benjamin as .
having “strong administrative
experience relative to our needs”
and said that at age 41, Benjamin
“holds promise of long and valu-
able service as air academic
leader.’’ ,

Benjamin conceeded that he
ranks among the younger pro-
vost in the country but stressed
the value of his past experiences.

“I think I have paid my dues,”
Benjamin said. “I have a good
deal of administrative expe-
rience, if not in terms of time
then certainly in combat. These
have been critical years [at Min-
nesota]. It certainly feels like a
long time.”

Benjamin also served as a pro-
fessor of political science at Min-
nesota and has written and
studied extensively in the fields
of post-industrial societies (i.e.
Britain, Japan and the U.S.) and
comparative political econom-
ICS.

The quality of undergraduate
education in this country or

more accurately its improvement

fits in to Benjamin’s world view
of the university, including Pitt.

“You [Pittsburgh] are really
not competing with Cleveland
anymore,” Benjamin said, “you
are competing with Seoul. If we
are going to compete, we're
going to have to do a helluva lot
better job in terms of really edu-
cating our people.”

Benjamin sees the opportuni-
ties for improving the education
available at Pitt; particularly
with the cooperation of those

“They may have been following
orders in an orderly fashion,” he
explained, “two warnings, then

-shoot." He added, however, that had '
the plane been’ American, it would i

not have been shot down.

Harris said the American
response should be to make it clear
that unarmed civilian aircraft
should never be treated in this way.

“It [the incident] produces_7short
-range bad effects in ourrelations,

but I don’t see it as leading to any- 1

thing else,”’Harris explained. “It will
be easily forgotten——both sides will

forget what they want.”

“The potential for joint ven-
tures and new kinds of experi-
ments in education and research
between the’ university,
Carnegie-Mellon University and
corporations is enormous,” he
said.

Benjamin says that those
opportunites will take time but
he thinks that immediate steps
can be taken to improve the func-
tion of the provost’s office.

“I hope to make the provost
office a little more visable and a
little more central to the function
of the university,” he said. “From
what I’ve understood, I don’t
think it’s been exploited as much
as ‘it possibly could‘.

“I want to reorganize the
structure of the office,” he added.
“It sounds very complicated‘ at
the moment.” - j , i

Beyond. those changes, Ben-
jamin says he only has “a lot of
ideas.” ‘ A

“The quality of the institution
is mixed, and it can improve,” he _‘
said. “[Pitt] has got collections of
people in anthropology and phi-
losophy, with international repu-
tations. In other departments,
there is a good deal of improve-
ment that could occur.”

Overall, Benjamin liked what
he saw_in his three, short visits to
Pitt.

“I don’t think [Pitt] knows
how good they are,” he said. “[It] _ «
is a very strong university."

He brought along some other
interested members of the family
who echoed that opinion.

His wife—known in the aca-
dernic world as Allison Stones—-
will be joining the art history
department at Pitt where she will
continue her studies as a medie-
valist. She is currently working

illuminated
manuscripts.‘ -

ui_.;.field adviser for

By TOBY TROSKY

Sometimes it is better to sit
back, observe and evaluate
before considering any changes
that need to be made in an organ-
ization. That is the policy for
Bridget Guernsey, the new
adviser for Pitt’s fraternities and
sororities.

“The fraternities and sororities
have a lot of untapped resources
and potential, but before I can
make any suggestions dealing
with how to modify ‘or revise the

system, I have to see how things

work,”—Guernsey said.

As assistant director of stu-
dent activities, it is Guernsey’s
responsibility to serve as adviser
to the Panhellenic Association,
the lnterfraternity Council and

. the Greek Week Committee.

Working within the Greek sys-
tem is not new to Guernsey. She
served as the national collegiate
Alpha Chi
Omega, her sorority at Ball State
University. Later she went to the
University of Cincinatti, where

a project required for her‘ mas-
ter’s degree in counselor educa-
tion at the University of
Cincinatti._

Good communication
between the students and faculty,
is often hard to achieve at a large
university, but discussing any
problems that arise should not be
too difficult thanks to Guern-
sey’s open door policy.

“Her door is always open, and
she is always willing to talk to
us,” Ed Polovina, co-chairman
for the Greek Week Committee
said. *

Greg Wilson, Interfraternity
president agrees.

“She's really easy to talk to,”
he said. “She’s helpful, receptive
to new ideas and has lots of good
ideas of her own.”

Although Guernsey has only
been at Pitt for a short time, she
is aware of what is going on
around her, and is already think-
ing about various aspects of the
Greek system that need to be
revised. .

‘‘I would like to increase the

 

 

 

system, both within the univer-
sity and externally.” Guernsey
said. Revising Panhellenic rush
is also on her agenda. A

“She’s been a big help when it
came time to revise the bylaws
for Panhel," Lynn Weinberg,
Panhel president said. “She sat
down and spent a lot of time on
it.”

“In the few days that I have
been working with her, she's
been very helpful. If she doesn’t
know the solution to a problem,
she’ll take it on and find the solu-
tion. She is assertive and over-
comes any obstacles that she
encounters along the way," Wil-
son said.

The students spending the
most time with Guernsey are
very pleased with her and are
looking forward to working with
her.

“We want to surround our-
selves with people who are going
to be able to give good advice to
help us make good decisions,”
Polovina said. ”Bridget is one of

Opinion

  Playing
Charades

Minorities have been the focus of so many politi-
cians’ thoughts lately that one would think an election
year is right around the corner.

President Reagan has been courting women, blacks,
Hispanics and others so much since midsummer that
it’s hard to believe that the election is still 14 months
away. He’s eaten tacos in the West and attended
women’s club luncheons all over the country, while
assuring us that he is a staunch supporter of civil and
women’s rights.

Fortunately, there are some people beginning to see
through Mr. Reagan’s charade.

Speaking at a religious convention last week, a Rea-
gan aide told Southern blacks that things are getting
much better for them and that the president has been
and always will be fighting for their rights. The people
at the convention tended to disagree with him and told
him stories about living below the poverty level.

Reagan made a call to Lt. Col. Guion Bluford on
Wednesday, congratulating him for being the first
black man in space, “paving the way for others.”

Yet, where was Reagan on Aug. 27, when 250,000
marchers, many of them black, retraced the steps of
the 1963 march led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.?
Even a member of the administration was nowhere to
be seen. That doesn’t sound like good politicking.

Even Reagan’s reluctance to make King’s birthday a
national holiday shows that he is not a supporter of
civil rights; and if he does make it a holiday between
now and November 1984, it will only be a move to
snare a few votes from the black population.

Reagan’s standing with women isn’t so hot these
days, either. Justice Department -official ‘Barbara
Honegger’s resignation Iastjweek paved the way for
Reagan’s falling out —— and.quick tries at reconcilia-
tions — with the women of this country.

Honegger called Reagan’s efforts to eliminate sex
discrimination in federal and _st_ate laws a “sham”.
Shortly after that story hit, Reagan and his aides were
scheduling press conferences, luncheons and trips to
shopping_ malls to tell women not to believe
Honegger’s charges.

President Reagan's attempts to woo the support of
blacks, women and other minorities should not be
tolerated by those. who can see him for what he really is
- -- a politician out to get himself votes and nothing
else.

“Reagan has yet to prove to the American public that
he is in favor of civil and women’s rights. He’s said he is
hundreds of times, but he has yet to act upon those
words. He did appoint Sandra Day O'Connor to the
Supreme Court, but that was a token effort at best and .
one that should not be taken too seriously.

If Reagan could just put a few actions to go with his
words, maybe the whole country, and especially the
minorities, would be much betteroff.

Football season is here. If you’re

whose team has had the consistently

«outstanding football record Pitt has,

you’re probably caught up in the

be wondering why the cost of 2: sea-

You might also wonder why the

Who were those people who
stood in the sweltering heat,
clothes soaked with sweat,
throats dry and hoarse? People
of both sexes, all age groups and
all races and who carried signs
demanding peace, jobs and
freedom. '

These were the marchers on
August 27 of this year. They had
come to Washington, D.C., on
the same date of an earlier march
on Washington which had

occurred 20 years ago at which

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., had_
delivered his historic speech in
which he spoke of a dream of.
justice and peace and racial
equality.

The march on August 27 was
organized to dramatize the fact
that despite some progress in

.some areas the dream is still far

from being realized.

\
The marchers were casually
dressed and were—for the most
part—not professional political

activists. If they had been, con-

sidering their number (estimated
at 250,000), the march would not
have been necessary.

King’s Dream

These were people who spent
most of their time working in fac-
tories, teaching in schools, pro-
viding services in hospitals and
agencies or searching for
employment.

But they were also frustrated
and angry with the policies of the
current administration and with
the weakness with which the
Democrats have responded to
the challenge from the
Conservatives.

They came from unions, leftist
political groups, religious organ-
izations, fraternities, sororities
and community groups.

They chanted, “The people
united will never be defeat-

Young children rode on the
shoulders of adults and clutched
an array of brightly colored bal-
loons and banners.

As this enormous multitude of
humanity snaked its way
through the streets of Washing-

and from distant parts of the 

country.

The marchers listened to the
speeches from the podium, par-
ticularly those of Stevie Wonder
and Coretta Scott King. They
discussed, the prospects of more
intensive community organizing
in the future and preparations
for the 1984 elections.

They sang songs which have
come to symbolize the move-.
ment for social justice, songs

such as “We Shall Overcome” 15?’

and “We Shall Not Be Moved."

As weary marchers with ach-
ing limbs soaked their feet in the
ice-cold water of the misty foun-
tains near the Lincoln Memorial,
it became clear by their mood
conversations that this march

A chubby-faced black youth
ran through the fine spray of the
fountain. He wore a powder blue
shirt with a picture of King

working for the universitsv does
not have to pay tuition. If that
student has an annual tuition bill
of $2,400, his parents will be
taxed for that money that they

are not even making, if the bill ,

dies.

Budzinski and the CGS stu-
dent cabinet held a meeting Wed-
nesday night to devise plans to
make sure the bill is passed. Two
CGS representatives will be
appointed to meet with Sens.
John Heinz and Arlen Specter to
get their support for the bill and
ask _both of them to co-sponsor
it. Heinz is a member of the
Senate Finance Committee and
Specter is a member of the
Senate. Education Committee.

A legislative aid to Heinzsaid
although the senator is suppor-
tive of the bill, he will not co-
sponsor ‘it because of two
provisions that were recently"
added. One provision would give
tuition breaks to spouses of
employees of companies and uni-
versities and the second clause

, would give financial ‘assistance

for travel time between work and
classes. .

The aide, who wished to be
unidentified, said Heinz is reluc-
tant about those provisions
because of the current ecomonic
status of the country. He said
when Congress reconvenes Sept.

cussions on those two provi-
sions, but he said he doesn't see
the bill being held up because of
them. ,

“lf Sen. Heinz were asked to
vote with those provisions, he

' would vote yes because he’s

always been a supporter of edu-
cational financial assistance.”
ln addition to approaching
senators, CGS is also planning to
hold a letter—writing workshop

-for students to draft letters to

their representatives, with sta-
tionery and addresses’ provided
by CGS.

“We’re also asking that stu-
dents and corporations through-
out Pittsburgh develop petitions

V on their corporate letterhead and

ask their representatives to co-
sponsor the bill,” Budzinski said.

“lt‘s going to affect everyone
in the university because fewer

' students would be attending

school because of the fact they
won’t be able to afford to,” she

, said. “I want the administration

involved in, or at least made
aware of this, because it’s really
going to affect Pitt.”

If all else fails, Budzinski said
supporters of the bill might be
able to get it into the Senate in
the form of an educational bill,
but action may not be taken on

that until 1985.

Photos

Hillman Library’s Archives of
Industrial Society has been given
over 16,000 photographic images
by the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie
Railroad (P&LE) depicting the
history of the P&LE from 1903
to 1970.

The photographic records of
the P&LE, along with other his-

torical documents and business .

records, captured railroad oper-
ations and various aspects of life
in the cities, small towns and
rural areas along the P&LE’s
lines in southwestern Pennsylva-
nia and eastern Ohio.

The Pitt’ ‘News, Friday September 2, 1983

Newsbriefs

The bulk of these images exists

as negatives, a large number as '

8x10 glass plates. The collection
also includes a number of prints,
the most recent of which are the
work of nationally-known
photo-documentarian David
Plowden. Complementing the
photographs are over 2,000 feet
of 16mm movie film which depict
such things as railroad work
crews in the 1930s, various con-
struction projects and a parade
of boats on the Monongahela
River.

This collection will be made
available to the public by the
Archives of Industrial Society
after technical processing of the
materials is completed.

CALLBACLKS ON SEPTE

GOOD by C.P. Taylor

‘ - Set in Germany in the l930’s,

Good chronicles the moral
capitulation of a professor
who unself-consciously
becomes the intellectual
defender of Nazi policy. The
playwright constructs his
indictment of the protagonist
out of little acts of selfishness,
cowardice and betrayal. Band

music and a strain of black _

comedy provide ironic coun-
terpoint. Ours will be the ﬁrst
production of the play since

its Broadway triumph.

Directedby Gillete Elvgren.

Curse of the Pink Panther’

65‘

Showcase, Friday Septemberi2, 1983

$l%¢&*¢

By RICHARD SATER

A gold star for anyone who
remembers that the actual Pink
Panther is a valuable diamond with a
cat-shaped pink figure at its center.
Following the gem (stolen) from one

owner to another has been the ‘

"periphery, at least, of the films in the
Pink Panther series. Let's see: there
was The Pink Panther (1964), A Shot. in
the Dark (also 1964), The Return of the
Pink Panther (1975), The Pink Panther

Strikes Again (1976) and The Revenge of .

the Pink Panther (1978). The key player,
Peter Sellers as the intrepid Inspector
Clouseau, died in 1980, bringing to an
end...wait, not quite. There was The
Trail of the Pink Panther (1982) and now
the new one, The Curse of the Pink
Panther. But...how?, V

The plot is simple: seems Inspector

Clouseau has been missing for a year; ,

public outcry demands that he be
found. ”If France's greatest detective
is missing, get the world's greatest
detective to find him” runs the rea-
soning. Apparently, few are aware of
Clouseau’s...ah...minor discrepan-
cies. Chief Inspector Dreyfus (stillla-
gain played by Herbert Lom) is,
however; with the aid of a computer,
he selects instead the least likely can-
didate for the search—in this case,
Detective Clifton . Sleigh, NYPD,
characterized by screen newcomer_
Ted Wass. (”Is that ‘slay’ as in ’kill'.7”

‘he. isvasked.‘"No," he replies. ”It’s

Robert Wagner, Tedd Wass, Capucine and the late David Niven from Blake Edwa1_'ds'Cur,se of the Pink Panther.‘

’sleigh’ as in ‘one horse open’.") T

Decadence has flourished during
Clouseau’s absence; his possible reap-
peararice does not excite the pro-vice
factions. The Mob decides to slay (as
in ”kill’_’) him; I

There's the expected lot of pain- i

and-destruction gags, and Lom is the
victim of much of it with the others

after Our Hero receiving the rest as .
Sleigh remains unscathed. He has
. quite a bit of trouble with simple,.pas-

sive objects like doors‘ and umbrellas
and toys. He stumbles through,the
chaos of his own making with a fool's
luck, and choreographic "just in the
nick of time” saves him. A similar
kind of annoyance is generated by
those old Road Runner-and Coyote
cartoons. '

Wass is given little chanceto act; he

mostly stares through his eyeglasses i

with wary disbelief and mouths dia-
logue like "you don't say” with dead

seriousness. Nor does he ever lose .

the colorless Clark Kent—type stodgi—
ness. This brand of bungling myopia
is supposed to register as endearing
or at least as comic, but it fails to do

a either.

Wass carries heavy responsibility
in the crucial role, and to his credit, he
doesn't imitate Peter Sellers,
‘although Sleigh is as clumsy and

bumbling as Clouseau ever was. The

funniest extended sequence involves

.Wass and an inflatable Instant Com-

New Screamer Is

By FRANK DICIACOMOW

Another Stephen" King novel has‘

been fashioned into celluloid, and
once again, .the result proves that it
was a mistake. Cujo is the latestfilm

rendition of a King horror master-.

piece, and while it is not a total waste,
itfalls short of scaring the viewers
the way he would have wanted it to.

The meat (or should I‘ say flesh?) of
the problem is that Stephen King is

. too good at what he does—he knows

I

exactly how to send his readers
imaginations runningright into the
tunnel of horrors. Moreover, he
intensifies their fright by lacing his
plot around a series of intricate and
accurate characterizations and tangi-
ble monsters (such as the rabid St.
Bernard which represents the horror
of Cujo). A Stephen King novel shows
that he not only knows how to scare
his audience, but how to_scare them
in the security of their own‘
backyard——he_ brings terror to the
neighborhood. « '
So, Cujo should be scary. Like Polter-

panion at a French cafe. The_rubber
doll, acquiring a hole in her upper
thigh, loses T air and needs several
urgent refills.

The Curse of the Pink Panther follows
the venerable Film Comedy Recipe:
thin plot embellished with slapstick
fights, a car chase and wholesale por-
tions of unsubtle humor. Worse, it's
too often predictable. An obligatory
love interest is thrown in—her name

is Juleta (Leslie, Ash). At a crucial

point during some sort of Mardi Gras
festival in Spain, she proves to be a
martial arts expert. ‘

The search for Clouseau is compli-
cated by the fact that "he" appears in
the film with his identity changed via
plastic surgery. His _lady friend,

ihéalth‘ resort operator Countess

Chandra (Joanna Lumley),'temporar-
ily has possession of the Pink
Panther, and the trio plans to live in
luxury and anonymity. These awk-
ward workings ill-conceal the unden-
iable fact‘ that Sellers is quite dead.
Only the French accent and allusions
to the past remain, amounting to
polite necrophilia.

Top-billed David Niven reappears

together are pleasantly nostalgic, the

R’eallyOl

geist and Halloween, it‘ takes place in a
quasi-suburban neighborhood that
reeks of conformity and the everyday

trials of ”modern life.” However, like

most films, Cujo lea-ves very little to
the imagination, and that is why
every movie version of a King story,
except for Carrie, has been disappoint-
ing. The story’s villain is a dog, so,
despite the excellent make-up work
on the St. Bernard, Cujo still ends up

looking like a cockeyed version of Old

Yeller.

Cujo deals with two families: an ad
agent's textbook wife and kid and a
redneck car mechanic's terminally
disgusted wife, kid and dog (Cujo, if
you haven't figured it out by now).
While the grease. monkey's life is
apparently repulsive, the ad man's

situation is not so peachy, either. His:

wife, played by Dee Wallace (that
actress from E. T. who has that con-
stant ”my midlife crisis started at 21"
look on herpface), is having an affair
with the neighborhood carpenter-—

nicest in the picture and regrettably
short. Their connection with the

main plot of Curse is tenuous. A‘

shame that they couldn't have been

the focus. Curse is to be David Niveh’_s._
I last film. Impressionist Rich Little felt

obliged to announce that he'd dubbed
much of Niven’s dialogue which-
due to the illness affecting the late

r.actor’s speech—was difficult to

understand. Mr. Little might have
kept shut about it. David Niven

than that. __ ‘

Director Blake Edwards has guided
the series since its inception, and he
handles the familiar stuffwith his
usual dexterity. It's not really a bad
film, just relentlessly mundane. ”I
have ahorrible. feeling we are seeing
history repeat itself," says Lom,
aptly, early in the film. The familiar
cartoon panther prowls the tedious

title sequence, and Henry Mancini’s.

still-good score is put through its
paces again. Location filming in Spain
and France is used to advantage.‘

The real curse_of the Pink Panther
is Sellers. Will Edwards continue his
series with Wass? Inadvisable. With
Sellers gone, it is decidedly time‘ to

put the panther to sleep. The last line _

of the film is given to Charles Litton:
”Never look a gift horse" in the
mouth.” What? I it ‘

Yeller  

monsters in the closet.

The two families intertwine when
the ad agent brings his Jaguar to the
grease monkey for repair work. This

.- is where the nightmare begins._‘Cujo«

makes his appearance about this

time, but he doesn't begin his reign of’
terror until later in the film when '

Wallace and child bring the other
family car to get fixed——only to dis-
cover that the only thing open for
business is C1ijo’s foaming
mandibles.

The movie, except for the conclu-
sion, follows King’s novel pretty
closely, and it even replaced the
schlock of a lot of gore with the terror
of some pretty scary growling and
screaming. However, that is the_clos-
est Cujo comes to letting the audience
useiits imagination. The dog, no mat-
ter how pus-ridden, is no substitute

for the murky horror of the readers’

imagination. Consequently, Cujo
proves that, when it comes to Ste-
phen King, Technicolor is no match
for gray matter. ‘

REVERSE THE CHARGES
By Samuel Simon and Joseph Waz Jr.
Pantheon

Historically, the telephone com-
pany is ”The Telephone Company,"
an awe—inspiring, mystical corporati-
ono of large and hazy proportions
which helps our fingers do the walk-
ing. Untilrecently, Ma Bell has been
.the big star of the show, but recent
legislation hasaimed at de-regulating
the industry.

Telephone bills are a fact of life;
you want the service and you pay for

it, but actually, there are some _a-lter- I

natives -to the Bell system, particu-
larly for frequent long-distance

‘ caller. Reverse The Charges, by ‘Samuel

Simon and Joseph Waz, Jr., is a useful
"consumer guidebook to the whole

lprocess. S_ubtitled"How to "Save

Money on Your Phone/Bill,” the book

offers easily understandable and

accessible information and tips on
equipment, wiring the system, rates,
and more. Many areas offer budget
long distance rate systems (Pitts-
burgh has a service called ”DART")
which allow toll calls at substantially
reduced rates, subject to some res-
trictions. And did you know that it is
now legal to buy your own telephone,
rather than rent from the phone
company? The pros and cons are dis-
cussed in detail. .

The authors ‘suggest reading the
consumer guide at the front of your
telephone directory and also examin-
ing your bill carefully—make sure
you understand why and exactly
what the Charges Cover. You may be
paying for services your are not
receiving. Relevant addresses and te-
lephone numbers are included, along
with the procedures for handling
Complaints and queries. 

Reverse The Charges is a product of
the Telecommunications Research
and Action Center, -dedicated to

also real

that he had managed to escape the
Country. The time is today, and Adolf
Hitler, ”the one out of hell,” is disco-
vered alive in the Amazon. Five Israe-
lis, following questionably authentic‘
directions, stumble onto the man's
encampment
swampy wilderness; and he is old, old.
The searchers arrange to Carry him

out, to get him to San Cristobal and ’

air transport. A
News and rumour travel quickly
over the globe as opportunists and

the Curious plot and wonder. Inter‘.-,

esting legal questions arise: how Can

.one man be put on trial for the I
‘murder of six million people? Who

should hold the tribunaL—the United
Nations? Germany? Suppose Mr.
Hitler is senile or insane.» What then?

The last Chapter of the book gives
Hitler the opportunity to speak, to
defend himself. ”Perhaps I AM the
Messiah, the true Messiah,” he says
in part. ”The Reich begat Israel.
These are my last words.” His rea-
soning is complex and startling. And
disconcertingly convincing.

The Portage to San Cristobal of AH. is
steeped in Jewish lore and history.
Steiner's literary style iststriking and
at times confusing, but his tale is
powerful and disquieting.

Houses or HORROR
By Richard sWiner
Bantam ’

Creaking doors, slamming shut-
ters and things that go ”whoosh” in
the night are not only figments of
‘John Carpenter movies, but they are
phenomena in houses
throughout America. That's what
Richard Winer tries to prove, any-
way, in Houses of Horror

Houses of Horror is a Collection of
twenty said-to-be-true stories about
grisly ghosts and restless spirits
which haunt Certain American edifi-
ces. Some of the stories are about
spirits of the average person haunt-
ing a home, while others deal with
the spirits of famous people, like
Harry Houdini and Abraham Lincoln.

All of the structures Winer writes I

about. have one thing in common:
they include at least one (and as many
as ten) spirits wandering around.
Some of these ghosts search corri-
dors of houses, hotels and theaters
for a particular purpose, while others
hang around earth apparently just
for the hell of it.

Whether you are an avid believer in
seances and spirits, reading for want
of reference material, or a skeptic of
the supernatural, Houses of Horror
makes a good bedtime story. And if
you hear a distant moan or if the
shutters slam for no visible reason,
remember—it was probably just the
wind....

THE HANDS» IN EXILE
By Susan Tichy.
Random House

In Susan Tichy’s first collection of
poems, she introduces a powerful
new style of American poetry. Most
of the works are set in the Middle
East, where Tichy lived in a kibbutz
(collective farm) during 1977. Des-
pite the poverty, tension and political
warfare throughout the Middle East,
Tichy manages to Create a profound
simplicity and Charmin her writing
while living in a place where beauty
and’ violence exist together.

Tichy’s style is mainly free verse,
written in a manner that is very easy
to read. There is a poignancy to her
themes, and she exudes a subtle
power that can hold the reader spel-
lbound for hours. A

The Hands In Exile is an example of a_
very down-to-earth attitude about?
life. Susan Tichy I writes in the-
assured manner of a person who has

sought» self-identity and has found it '

amidst a land occupied with exiles and
refugees. In her poem ”When I Stop

,. Work...," Tichy summarizes her love

for the land and her hope for the

.future in ‘the first sentence of the

poem: ”When I stop work and rub my
face, I rub soil of the~Promised Land
into my skin.”

For a first Collection, Susan Tichy
demonstrates a sensitivity not usu-
ally found in modern poetry. For any
fan of the genre, The Hands In Exile is
an enjoyable experience.

Well, if you've been in College at

Au-thor Lawrence Graham spent four

the uninitiated prospective collegiate.

The information is likeably-

and of some use as an overview, but
like the simulator in driver education

”You'll find dishonest students

CHINESE MASSAGE THERAPY
Translated by Hor Ming Lee and
Gregory Whincup

Shambhala

Massage - the respectable variety
- has its place in medicine. For years,
the Chinese in particular have been
exploring the therapeutic possibilites
of massage, developing techniques
which have proven useful in the
treatment of headaches, ulcers,

sprains, bruises, fractures and other
maladies. '
Chinese Massage Therapy, compiled at
the Anhui Medical School and Hospi-
tal in China, details the processes
involved and their specific applica-
tions to 31 medical problems "from
minor to severe.” Massage Therapy is
NOT touted as a miracle cure-all;
combining Eastern practices with
Western medicine, however, is a logi-
_cal and sound concept.

Comfmonly-used aCupoints——‘
anterior view

The handbook is aimed, naturally

enough, at the experienced therapist . A

and other professionals in the health
field. . Common techniques are
explained; the text is adequately illus-
trated but thoroughly intimidating.
This is no game for amateurs. The
”responsible layperson" nevertheless
gains an overview of Clinical massage
and respect for those who practice
‘ the art.

There are fairies at the bottom of
our garden. Steve Kravette's Get a job
in 60 Seconds is as thoroughly unbe-
lievable as its title. Naturally, it takes
a lot more seconds than that; the cru-
cial minute refers to the first 60
seconds of contactbetween the job
applicant and the interviewer, "clear
seconds of undivided attention from
your prospective employer focused
on you.” Maintain that interest and
you will get hired.

Kravette’s book does make some
valid (if common—sense-ish) points:
first impressions are _important. Pre-
pare for your interview; be enthusi-
astic and truthful during it and follow
up afterwards. But whatever sound
advice the author has to offer is lost

a in the unbearably coy packaging—the
_ insistent optimism and even the para-

graphing and sentence structure
(Reread the first three sentences at
the top of this for an example.)
Let's play Getting A Job. Kravette
advises setting up a" Job Game and
playing by your own rules until you
achieve your goal. ”By the time you
finish this book, whateverhas been
stopping you fromgetting a job will
stop stopping you.” The style reads as
condescending; it's hard to hide the
fact that Kravette has been a free-
lance writer for some years. His
explanation that he'd consulted a
. number of experts‘and included their
observations in the book doesn't
quite work when he refers to them as
”the sales manager for a well-known
sporting goods brand...” and so on.
Positivism is useful, but Get A ]ob in
60 Seconds suffers from overkill. Some
reworking could streamline the sty-
listic excesses, and perhaps a more
realistic title could be attached.
"Iglhere’s more to getting a job than
t is. ‘ ‘

HOW-MUCH IS TOO MUCH?
By Leonard Gross
Random House

Alcohol issone of the common
denominators of life. To drin’k'or not
- for many people -— is a daily deci-
sion, but few like to think seriously
about their liquor consumption. The
mere mention of alcoholism is taboo;
the term ”socia’l drinking” serves as a
huge blanket inst-ead. . '

Leonard Gross’ -How Much Is Too
‘ Much? The Effects of Social Drinking
addresses -itself to the situation. Even
a moderate degree of alcohol con-
sumption generates ”cases for cau-
tion" - the possibilities of cirrhosis,
cancer, hypertension, birth defects.
But there are studies which indicate
that small quantities of alcohol taken
on a regular basis can prolong life by
permitting ”the blood to flow more
freely through the arteries and ther-
eby make the heart's work easier.”
But as Gross quickly points out, con-
clusive proof has not been estab-
lished.

How much alcohol intake is consi-
dered medically non-risky? ”A drink a
day, two at most, the drinks no
stronger than 14 grams of absolute
alcohol apiece” is Gross’s guarded
conclusion. How Much Is Too Much? is
tolerable non-fiction, matter—of—fact
rather than melodramatic, and tho-
roughly researched. Because of the
controversial nature of the argu-
ment, Gross’ book functions as an
‘inquiry, presenting the available
information and leaving the final
answer to the reader's discretion.

This is the chance for Tennessee

‘ﬁieoach John Majors to gain revenge.

Majors, generally known as the sav-
ior of the Pitt football program, has
not experienced the same success in

, Tennessee, where football is second

only to religion.The 35-32-l record
since leaving Pittsburgh in 1976 is
far from the expectations of the
loyal Volunteer following, the group
that ran former head coach Bill Bat-
tle out of town despite a 59-22-2
record during the early l970’s.

The hopes of Majors, a former
Tennessee All-America tailback in

éhe l950’s, to bring a national cham-
-pfionship to ‘ Knoxville will be

rekindled tomorrownight, when the
Vols take on the Panthers before a
boisterous sellout crowd of 91,000-
plus at Neyland Stadium.

Besides meeting his former team,

which he took from thelowest

depths to the pinnacle of collegiate.

football in four short years, Majors
and the Volunteers have an addi-
tional motive—getting.even for a 30-

—_.‘g»‘6 whipping by Pitt in 1980.

“Sure I’d like to beat Pitt,” Majors
said. “I’d ‘be a bad football coach
and a selfish individual if I said I
would not want a win.”

’ However, the win won’t come
easy according to Majors, despite a
quote attributed to him about Pitt’s

‘question mark at the quarterback
position.

“I never said Pitt didn’t have a
quarterback,” he said. “I’m not that

.g.; dumb. I never made the statement

if that Pitt does not have a
quarterback.

All-America candidates Fuad Reveiz (left) and Jimmy Colquitt

“I have some big concerns for our
first game against Pittsburgh. I ‘d say
that you really don’t know what to

expect. It’s a big factor getting of to a

big _start to build attitude and
confidence”.
Two areas that Majors doesn’t

have to worry about are at quarter-

back and the kicking game. Alan
Cockrell gives Tennessee what Pitt
doesn’t have—experience at a key
position. The 6-2, 218 lb. junior

2021 yards and 12 touchdowns, set-
ting three Vol season passing
records in the process. C.

If the quarterback situation is
bright, the Vol kicking game shines
like newly polished shoes. Both pun-

ter Jimmy Colquitt and placekicker
Fuad Reveiz are legitimate All-

America candidates.

  T op 20 Lady Spikers Goal    

By MARK A. S|NDLER'

Top 20 Or Bust.‘

Heretofore let it be known this is
the theme that will be as much "a part
of women’s volleyball coach Shelton
Collier’s thinking as the crack is a
part of the Liberty Bell. '

Collier and the Lady Panthers

begin their season tonight in the
Field House against no less than
four other schools in the Pitt Pre-
view tournament.
, ' Reaching the nation’s elite in such
matters is not only a long shot for
the ll-membersquad, but exceeds
perhaps all other expectations that
Collier has for his team’s play. .

Entering town will be Akron,
Loyola of Chicago, Navy and East-
ern Michigan. The tournament,
which starts at 7 p.m., is a fresh start
for everyone, even though the Lady
Panthers likely heed only those two
squads from Loyola and EMU.

The rest is, well, standard material ‘

for such a classic.

Still, Collier is, and always has
been, one not to look with gloating
eyes from the sidelines.

“The question is whether we can

V take a team after one week, with two

freshmen, and beat teams [that have
been] practicing for three weeks,”he
said earlier in the week.

“This early in the year, two weeks

 is a lot. Two-a-days multiplied by 14

is 28 practices. This concerns me."
An informal consensus of the
opposing coaches tells him indi-
rectly that such worries are
unfounded. Just the same, the Lady
Panthers have been on the hard-
woods for a little over a week. Why
they started so late (when Collier
was really set to begin earlier in
August) is a question only the
athletic administration can answer.
No matter how many weeks any
of the teams has been preparing for
the start of its schedule, that same
consensus revealed that all five
teams will be beginning with
trepidation. - '

continued from page nineteen

Colquitt averaged 46.7 yards per
punt in 1982, second only to Iowa’s
Reggie Roby. A nephew of Steeler
Craig Colquitt, the junior broke his
uncle’s record for punting average
by two yards.

Reveiz’s statistics are also impres-
sive. The 5-11, 220 lb. junior set a
NCAA record for most field goals

. over 50 yards (8 for 10 from that

distance) and from inside the 50 yard
range (13-17) hitting a total of 27 for
31 for the 1982 season. At one point,
Reveiz hit 14 field goals in a row and

hit a record 60-yarder against Geor- I

gia Tech. .

The last time Pitt faced such a
deadly kicking game was against
Florida State in 1982, where the
Seminole duo of Rohn Stark and
Bill Capece played a major key in
ruining the Panthers’ chance for a
national championship.

‘ Just like Florida’s stadium, Ten-
nessee’s Neyland Stadium provides
ample room for the Vol fans, and an
excess of 90,000 screaming fans can
intimidate the most veteran team.

Majors disagrees on the crowd
factor, but only slightly. .

said. “I prefer to play here than any-

that many teams love it here. They
cut loose and love it. They get really
excited.” . ~.
And they are probably ecstatic
over the number one pre-season
ranking given by Sport Magazine.
Such a lofty prediction is down-
played by Majors, especially consid-
ering the author of the article was

former. Pitt sports information?’-

director Beano Cook.

“I think [Beano] was trying to
have some fun,” Majors said. “He’s a
big Pitt man. He was quoted there in
the Memphis papers that he did that
to get back at us. —

“To come from 10th in the confer-
ence in defense to No. l in the coun-
try has got to be one of the greatest
miracles in the world.”

Fortunately for Majors, the heat
by the ‘vicarious Vol fans has not
compared with what Battle faced.

Majors can understand the pres- 

sure Panther head coach F oge Fazio
faced last year. ‘

“Foge had one tough kind of job a
coach can have,” he said. ‘‘I wouldn’t
envy that position. He had one of the
toughest in the‘ country. He was told
to win all of the games and you just
can't do that.”

The monkey is off Fazio’s back. It
still remains on Majors’.

During training camp at Edin-

was the Denver Broncos’ Hal Dyer,
who had been on the same staff as
Foge Fazio at Cincinnati in the mid-
"705. “There are a lot of prospects

said. “I think they got a break by not

Bill Sapio, a junior defensive end
from Vorhees, N.J., who had moved
up to a starting position but then
was held out of a full-scale scrim-
mage because of an ankle sprain,
standing on the sideline beforehand,
said, “This is like putting food in

Loyola Pitt ’s Main Challenge

“I‘m always uneasy going into the
first match,” Collier said. “I’m look-
ing forward to it, but you're appre-
hensive about how the team will
play. «

“We’re only concerned about
what happens on our side of the net.
We want to win our matches; we’re
concious of that. To me, we have to
win all four to be the stepping stone
to the Top 20.”

To be sure, it will beia precarious
walk at least. Loyola presents the
best opportunity to knock off the
Lady Panthers early. It defeated Pitt
last season, in mid-September at the
Cleveland State Invitational, only
one of seven losses in 49 matches.

Coach Carolyn Bellows will pose
a stiff upperhand as she brings along
three four-year starters. All seniors,
the trial between the two schools
may be decided by middle hitter/-
blocker Mary Oskielunas and Bel-
lows’ two 6-2 offense-oriented

setters, Alda Pleirys and. Carol

Slowinski. -

If ‘anything, Bellows respects
Collier.

“lf Pitt has the same people they
had last year, we’re in-for a dog-

, fight,” Bellows said with a hearty

laugh. “Shelton always puts out a
good, strong team. Someone else

and I were talking about Pitt the V

Lady Panther team is aggressive.

 “ iTlie‘Pit‘t‘Niew-s, Friday'Sep'tem‘beri2,‘l983 a

“They play every match hard and
with a lot of intensity."

What Collier will counter with on _

his side of the net is still undecided.
It was earlier thought that middle
hitter Ulana Kohutiak suffered shin
fractures in her right leg. X-rays
later disproved that. Freshman Sue
Hoover, to drop a name, might be
inserted as a replacement, though
Collier said another frosh, Kris
Wexell, is coming out of preseason
training as tops on the squad.
Drawing on the first-team All-Big

A Eastmaterial that Kohutiak is, Col-

lier -did disclose that he “would be
very surprised if she didn’t win back
her spot by tonight.” .

. What is certain is that setters Judy
Young and Cathy Rupp, both jun-
iors, will start this weekend and
hence initiate Collier’s fresh attempt
at going only with the 6-2.

And to avert near-catastrophe,
that is the sole reason Collier has
devoted almost all practice time to
serving technique. ‘

“We're definitely sacriﬁcing other
skills to serving,” he said. “This is the
route for conﬁdence;.[the players]
know it’s. a vehicle
confidence.

“A -volleyball team is only as
strong as its weakest link, because
other teams go after that. Your
strongest link means nothing.”

the game. Another one similar in
idea is that which EMU coach Frank ‘
Fristensky, Czechoslovakian by
birth, has on-his hands.

Coaches should be so blessed.

“We stress very much teamwork,"_
Fristensky, entering his second year s
at EMU, said of his 15 players.

“I believe that even though we had
problems last year[l6-19 problems],
that’s a reﬂection of the previous
year. And this is what I would say is

, where you get 15 players and they are
very, very equal.” '
Coming off a year before, during
which Fristensky had no chance to
personally recruit, he comes in with
solid credentials. On paper, that is.
' Also‘ utilizing a 6-2 offense, he will
employ freshmen twin sisters Laura
and Lisa Hayes as setters. Both
recently played for Michigan’s Class
A state championship team.
Satisfying his craving for a “fast
offense," Fristensky has primarily
focused on serve receiving since
opening practice sessions August 12.
“I believe that serve receiving is
going to be the key of our offense
and we ran 80-90 percent of training
camp going over that,” Fristensky
said. “It's really improved a lot since
then, but you never know when
some mistake will come. We'll have ,
to see how they can adjust to the
serve receive and topthe set.”

And so it goes. Just as uncertain
Bellows remains, Collier equally
"imparts a starting team with “not

“It’s been driving people to play

W. responsibilities

By CHARLIE O'HARA

After a season of disappointing
injuries in 1982-83, the Lady
Panther gymnastic team is looking
forward to what should be a differ-
ent story in 1983-84.

It seems that last season, with the
loss of several important members,
the team was _often faced with the
misfortune of compelting with fewer.

” than the permitted number of com-"'

petitors in many of the season’s
meets. I

“This season, that problem should
be remedied as several injured gym-
nasts are recuperating and, four
freshman gymnasts capable of
breaking into the starting lineup are
joining the team,” Coach Donna
Sanft said. ’

Among the injured Lady Panthers
of a year ago was Lisa Shirk, who
became the school’s first national
champion back in the spring of 1982.

-§9.fter suffering ankle problems last

season, which kept" her from com-
peting throughout the season, Shirk
underwent reconstructive surgery in
March on the ankle. ‘
Presently she IS in excellent physi-
cal condition aside from the» ankle
which is still a question mark.
Whether Shirk returns at top
form or _not will obviously have a
bearing on the team's success, but

_,__ that doesn’t mean that thellgady ‘J
“*5-"'Panthers don't have some quality

personnel,

The other returning seniorsare
Babbie Flock, Karen Martin, Eve
Singer and Sara Strickland.

As a freshman, Martin placed
10th at nationals on the uneven bars.
At the northeast regionals in 1982,
she placed 5th in the balance beam,
the uneven bars and the all-around

_ competitions.

The rest of the senior leadership
will fall on the
shoulders of Flock, Strickland and
Singer. ' .

As for returningjuniors, the Lady

‘-'5‘ Again, That Name....

Pittsburgh Maulers’ general man-_
ager Georg/e Heddleston has
announced the appointment of two
new assistant coaches and two front
office staff members to the United
States Football League team.

I Joining head coach Joe Pendry’s
staff will be Ellis Rainsberger and
Frank Lauterbur. The former will
assist in the player personnel depart-
ment, and the latter is the defensive

‘ line coordinator.

Rounding out the announcement
list are the hirings of public relations
director Bill Keenist and equipment
manager Mike McVean.

Rainsberger, 50, who was the
offensive backfield coach of the
Denver Gold last season, brings 26
years of coaching experience to the
Maulers. Prior to his Denver stint,
Rainsberger spent 1978-82 as offen-
sive coordinator of the Winnipeg
Blue Bombers of the CFL.

After reaching All-Big Seven per-

‘former status, the Kansas State

alumnus moved on to Drake Uni-
versity (1959-61), where he was
assistant offensive and defensive line
coach. In 1962, Rainsberger was
appointed head coach at Washburn
University, compiling a three-year,
mark of 17-10.

One year later (1965) he served as
linebacker coach at Kansas, before
moving to Southern Illinois as head
coach in 1966.

Prior to relocating in Wisconsin
in 1973, Rainsberger spent six years
as both offensive and defensive
coordinator at Illinois. '

Lauterbur brings 34 years of
coaching experience to the Maulers,
including 11 on the professional
level. Those stints were with the Bal-
timore Colts (l955-56); Los Angeles
Rams (1978-81); and the Seattle
Seahawks, with whom he was defen-
sive line coach in .1982. '

Panthers have Debbie Dabkowski
and Michelle Poulis. ‘

Both battled with injuries last sea-
son. For Dabkowski, it was a mix-
ture of rehabilitation and
competition. After she damaged her
knee at the Junior Olympics in
August of 1981, she was redshirted
for the 1981-82 season.

Poulis competed with injury last
season after sustaining knee damage
with which she was able to perform.

Of the four returning sopho-
mores, Jackie Calderone and Kristy
Pieters appear to be capable of mak-
ing big contributions to this season’s
squad.

Calderone, despite battling a
tough case of tonsilitis throught the
entire competition season, scored
well on the balance beam and vault.

c .1983 Beer Brewed by Miller Brewing Co., Milwaukee. WI

“This past summer, she worked
very hard at conditioning and is
much improved in all events,” Sanft
said.

Pieters, after much early success
last season, was injured and missed
the majority of the season.

“Kristy has rehabilitated her knee
and has been training all summer,”
Sanft said. “She is a gymnast who
has a high level of difficulty in every
event.”

Other sophomores, Diane
Mauder (vault and balance beam
specialist) and Lori Miller (balance
beam specialist) are also considered
to be contributors. _

As for the new recruits, there are
four.

join the Lady Panther squad. Quite
a bit is ‘expected ‘from them in only

their first season of competition, but _

by all indications these additions
should be welcome and could come
in quite handy for the team that had
almost as many major injuries as‘it
had competitors.

As for the schedule, the Lady
-Panthers have November meets at
Slippery Rock and home, as host of
the Pitt Invitational on the 19th.

December finds the ladies making
one appearance in Morgantown for
the West Virginia Invitational.

In January, Pitt hosts New
Hampshire and Slippery Rock and
visits Michigan State and West
Virginia.

For February, trips to Clarion,
Georgia and Florida are slated as

well as a home showdown with Penn
State. ‘ - .. .

In March, the regular season
winds down and post-season begins.
The Lady Panthers finish their home
season with a meet against James
Madison, and the season finale is ati
Maryland. Late in the month+-
(March 23-24)—the NCAA region-
als are scheduled, and in the first
week of April, the NCAA Nationals
will be held on the campus of the
University of Utah.

Making predictions is tough for‘
this squad due to the overwhelming .
number of injuries sustained a year
ago, but if health is a virtue present
during the upcoming season, then
the Lady Panthers could very well be
a force to be reckoned within the
east. ‘

.rj,'

By CHARLIE O'HARA

L, With the loss of senior captains

Chris Femiani and Mike Lloyd to
graduation and one of last season’s
freshman standouts, Kevin Garren,

to injury, the Pitt men’s gymnastic .

squad has quite a challenge ahead as
the beginning start of the 1983-84
training season nears.

Returning from the ’82-’83 team
that finished ranked 18th in the
country are two senior standouts,
Dave Smith and Frank Kratz, as

well as two sophomores, Matt-

Peters and Mark Klafter, who a year
ago. suprised many with apparent
ease in making the step up to colle-
giate competition. '

Panther coach Frank D’Amico
has high hopes for these four.

“We’re excited about our season,”
he said. “We have four very solid

. :- -_- ;,‘ -_Z.f' . . - , ._ \. /3:

returning all-arounders. Dave
Smith, who has qualified for nation-
als in his first three seasons, will be
gunning to become the school’s first
four-time qualiﬁer. In addition to
Smith, Frank Kratz, Matt Peters
and Mark Klafter will all be working
on the Olympic compulsory excer-
cises in an effort toready themselves
for possible Olympic trial
qualification. ’

“The all-important factor is keep-
ing injury free. If these four can stay
injury free, then I think we could
possibly improve on our ranking of
18 from last season.”

As far as the No. 5 man is con-
cerned, there could be help from any
number of competitors.

“Having lost our’ two side horse
specialists, Mike [Lloyd] and Chris

[Femiani],.we will need some sup-_

port from freshman recruit Mike
Mealie,” D’Amico said. “Mike, as a
senior at Ambridge High School,
won the Pennsylvania state title in
the side horse. We’re hoping that he
will bring immediate aid.

“Another guy I feel we can count
on this year is Eddie Miller. Eddie is
a junior this year who really
impressed me last season with some
of the things he did. After having
much difficulty with ﬂexibility, he
was able to work through all that
and turned in a pretty successful
season.”

D’Amico also mentioned three
other freshmen who could possibly
be of some assistance. Jim Gemelas,
also of Ambridge High, and two
walk-ons, Ben Rovee and Dem
Perosky, both of whom appear to
have good chances of sticking.

As for the schedule, the Panthers
will have more than their share stiff
meets.

After a stern seven-week condi-
tioning period beginning on Sep-
tember 6, the Panthers will open
their schedule the first week in
October with the Greater Baltimore
Open, at which several of the top
eastern teams are expected to
compete.

The Panthers’ home slate of meets
is to begin with their toughest com-
petition of the season.

The famed Japanese national
team will appear at Fitzgerald Field
the first week of December.

Thanks to their hosting of the
Japanese, the Panthers will miss the
Farmingdale Invitational—one of
the best proving grounds for any
team in the East.

Among the other meets D’Amico

consistency that will get them to the

came up short last spring.
