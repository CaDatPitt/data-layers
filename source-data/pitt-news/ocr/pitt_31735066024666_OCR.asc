Pitt panel evaluates

Persian Gulfconﬂ

By Gary Knapick

Senior Staff Writer

Onjanuary 16, 1991, Pittsburgh
Students for Peace President Erin
Bush attended a conference to
discuss solutions to the Persian
Gulf war. Halfway through the
panel discussion, a camera
operator from a local television
network announced that the aerial
bombardment of Iraq had begun.

“That sort of made the
discussion moot,” Bush said.

“Desert Storm: One Year Later,”
a panel symposium sponsored
Thursday by the PSfP and the
StudentAction Union, confronted
many of the same questions that
were being asked one year ago.

The symposium was the
realization of a wish expressed
by PSfP member Glen Groden to
Provost Donald Henderson
during November’s Presidential
Forum.

At the forum, Groden and other
PSfP members said the panel
discussion would help to
counterbalance the university’s
strong emphasis on Defense
Department research. When the

ict
students asked Henderson to
sponsor such an event,
Henderson responded, “I’m not
your daddy. You organize it, and
I’ll even pay for lunch.”

Henderson kept his word,
giving the PSfP with use of the
ballroom of the William Pitt Union
and food, as promised.

“Our objective today is to show
different sides of the issue,” Bush
said. “We will do this in an
objective manner so that you can
come to your own conclusions.”

The symposium was sponsored
in conjunction with the Student
Action Union because “the name
Pittsburgh Students for Peace

showed a little bias,” according‘

to Bush.

In her opening remarks, Bush
said such a discussion was
necessary because the war was
“an issue that divided families
and friends.” Bush said her
generation was “brought up to
think that war couldn’t happen in
our lifetime. Of course, on Jan.
16, it did.”

A panel of four faculty members
offered their opinions on the Gulf

Pitt’s Board of Trustees decided
the university will use $250 million
to buy real estate in Oakland, to
pay for capital projects and to
reﬁnance its debt.

The trustees approved the $250
million bond issue at its executive
committee meeting Thursday. Pitt
plans to use $75 million to
refinance debts, $50 million for
routine capital projects and $98
million for new projects.

The bond amount also includes
$50 million to repay the university

for capital projects funded
previously out of the‘ operating
budget.

Of the $98 million the board's
executive committee approved
$27.5 million to build residence
halls near Pitt Stadium and $29.6
million for projects like improving
the library system and renovating
classrooms.

The university will also spend
$13.2 million to buy an Oakland
building on Forbes Avenue and
$16.5 million to purchase the
Bellefield Towers at Fifth and
Bellefield avenues. About $4

Vz'z/tom urges students to emulate Martin Luther Kmgjr.

By Alissa Smith
For The Pitt News '

Joshua Silverman/The Pitt News
Civil-rights leader C.T. Vivian

In a commemoration Thursday for Martin
Luther King Jr., guest speaker C.T. Vivian
stressed that the “great ones don’t really
die. They remain with us.”

Vivian, a nationally known civil-rights
leader and consultant on diversity in the
work force, said although the opponents
of the civil rights movement are tid of King
they cannot stop people from following
him.

Vivian urged students to become the
Martin Luther Kings of today, stressing that
King’s work must be carried into the
future. “[Dr. King] was preparing us for the
21st century,” he said.

According to Vivian, a 21st—century

following in King’s footsteps would mean
creating a need for change, no longer
depending on white male attitudes,
working on a give and take between the
races and putting humanity ahead of

_ technology.

He advised future leaders in the audience
to remember.that it is not the education
they receive, but how much dignity they
establish for black America by using it that
counts. ~

One member of the audience, Janeen
Williams said, “I think that statement was
[Vivian’s] most important because it gave
students a better reason to go to college
than just the hope of getting a good job.”

Williams said most students don’t have
a real sense of what will happen after
graduation. She agreed that fighting for

black dignity was a goodway to start.

Vivian’s speech, followed by a question-
and—answer period, sparked not only a
standing ovation, but a desire for more
discussion.

Many students met for a reception
afterward to talk in greater depth with
Vivian and each other.

Pitt sophomore Tony Russ said he left
the Assembly Room with a greater
motivation to make a differerlC€ than
when he entered.

‘‘I feel like going out into the streets right
now, “ Russ said.

I Activities like this and others scheduled
for February’s Black Histofi’ Mom}? mun
make long—term changes, Russ said.‘ I
think it's a start. There is such a segfegamn

‘For T be Pitt News

Even though it’s unlikely
anAm'malHouse-style food fight
will break out there, students
shouldn't be able to get their

diplomas without eating at least
a semester’s worth of meals in
the Towers cafeteria. University
dining, with all the complaints
and imagined stomach disorders
involved in it, can be an integral
part of the college experience.

“It’s a cool thing to cut on the
cafeteria,” saidjulianne Fordyce,
director of residence dining.
“People don’t realize that we are
basically here to please the
students.”

Among changes made to the
dining service this year, the most
important is food service’s
response to all student
suggestions, she said.

Last semester students asked
for Fruity Pebbles, more
hamburgers and pizza at dinner.
Now the sugary cereal is stocked;
hamburgers are served twice a
week, and pizza is available for
lunch and dinner on Monday,
Wednesday and Friday.

“If parents find out that
hamburgers are on twice a week
they’d probably have a he-art
attack,” Fordyce said. “It’s what
the kids want, no matter how
you look at it.”

The food service has started
the React to Management
program to let students write
verbal comments about their
suggestions. Once a month, a
table is set out in the cafeteria
with a notebook for students to
leave anonymous messages.

The only one from last
semester not acted on was the
request to serve fruit juices all

day long, instead of only at‘

breakfast. “The university has to
make the decision on that. We’re
waiting for. them to decide."

Another way for students to
voice an opinion is to attend
food-committee meetings held
once a month. The meetings are
posted on the bulletin boards in
both Towers cafeterias and are
open to the public.

Fordyce gives tours of the
cafeteria before each food-
committee meeting. “I do it
because people don’t believe
we use name-brand products.
They think the storeroom is full
of black and white boxes.”

Instead, the room is piled high ‘

with huge boxes of General Mills,
Quaker, Campbell’s and Hunt’s
products.

“It’s the same thing you get at
home,” Fordyce said. “Just in
bigger containers.”

Pitt food service solicits student complaints

Fordyce also responded to
rumors that the university uses
grade C beef.

“That’s just not true,” Fordyce
said. “We use all choice meat.
We have specs we have to
follow, and that’s one of them.”

All menus are sent to a
corporate dietician who makes
sure they are nutritionally sound,
Fordyce said.

“We are very health
cOnscious,” she said. “We have
vegetarians and people with
stomach problems we try to
please.”

Of course, everyone will never
be satisfied with each meal
served at the university
cafeterias. But the next time you
wonder what is in those
vegetarian burgers or you think
your roast beef is looking green,
you can do more than just
complain to your friends.

Panther gun club still fighting

for re-opening of riﬂe range

Byjason Billings
The Pitt News

The Panther Pistol and Riﬂe
Club is still pressing the
administration to re-open the
Trees Hall shooting range,
which was closed in March 1990.

Club members, along with
the campus police, ROTC
cadets, and Lambda Alpha
Epsilon members (a national
honorary society for criminal
justice majors) used to use a
shooting range in the basement
of Trees Hall, which was built
in the 19603.

Pitt Facilities Management
closed the range after a bullet
ricocheted there, said Bill Lester,
who graduated last April and
was the original founder of the
club.

There has been no official
word on when the range would
reopen, but the possibility
remains that it could open by
the end of this academic year.

“Trees [Hall range] was close
and convenient— a good place
to shoot,” club President John
Haller said.

When the range closed, the
membership in the club
dropped from a little over 100
members, most of whom were
“casual shooters,” to its present
roster of 30.

Now members drive one or
two times a semester to a public
shooting range in Wexford that

is owned and maintained by
the State Game Commission.
There is a $5 entrance fee, and

‘The main motivation for carrying [a
ﬁrearm] is for self-defense. Of course,
there is no other logical reason to carry a

gun.

-John Haller, riﬂe club president

members must use their own
guns.

When the Trees Hall range
was still open, members were
allowed to use the .22 pistols
and riﬂes owned by Pitt. These
firearms.cannot be removed
from campus, so members must
use private guns when they
shoot in Wexford, Haller
said.

The cost of shooting is much
higher because members must
travel from Pitt to Wexford and
back. There is no transportation
cost when the range is on-
campus.

The club is now involved in
negotiations to reopen the Trees
Hall range, Haller said;

Pitt Facilities Management
estimated that it would cost the
university $84,000 to clean the
range and upgrade the
ventilating system.

According to Haller, the
resource Range Development
Department ofthe National Riﬂe
Association said that figureis,
grossly exaggerated. The club
is now looking into the cost of
an outside contractor to clean
the range.

The Panther Pistol and Riﬂe

99

Club began in April 1986 with a
mission “to promote safe and
responsible use of firearms for
target shooting and
competition,” according to
Haller.

The club has also taken a role
in helping to combat gun control
legislation. “Some people do
need guns,” Lester said.

“lPeople who use guns for
target practice] and ﬁrearms
have a bad reputation around
some people,” Lester said.

If someone does not break a
law when using a firearm, there
is no reason that they should
give it up, said Lester. R

“lPPRCl does not encourage‘
or discourage people to carry
guns. It’s an individual’s
decision,” Haller said,"['Ihe club]
is not here for some public
safety thing nor as a response
to crime. The club stands by its

mission defined in its
constitution.” ,
“Personally, the main

motivation for carrying la
firearm] is for self—defense,”
Haller said.

“Of course, there is no other
logical reason to carry a gun,”
he said.

Dollars option rising

By Kellie Burkett
For The Pitt News

No cash, no time and no stomach for the Towers cafeteria —,

any alternatives? The Pitt food service offers Choice Dollars. Not
only is it accepted at four restaurants, with others waiting in the
wings, but the bill usually gets sent home. ll

Choice Dollars works through your student ID like the other
meal plans and can“ be used at Schenley Cafe in the William Pitt
Union, Second Plate in Forbes Quad, Roy Rogers in the
Cathedral of Learning and Domino’s on North Craig Street.

Beginningjan. 27, Choice Dollars will be accepted at Towers
Express, the convenience store located in the lobby of Tower
B.

According tojames Beavers, assistant director of the university
housing and food service, the Choice Dollars plan has become
more popular each semester since its creation in September
1990.

“The same meal at the same place and at the same time every
day can be quite boring,” Beavers said. “With Choice Dollars,
the variety of meals, surroundings and mealtimes is a benefit.”

Domino's on North Craig has been a part of Choice Dollars
only since last semester, but it’s already attracting students.

“I got Choice Dollars when Domino’s was added,” said Pitt
senior Suzanne Burkhart. “It’s perfect when you need pizza and
you're too lazy to walk anywhere and too short on cash to have
it delivered. Just ﬂip thetip and your plastic.”

Choice Dollars will be a part of the Towers Express by Jan.
27. Getting three candy bars for a dollar and a gallon of milk
without putting your shoes on or grabbing your wallet has
never been easier. '

“Choice Dollars is better than eating in the cafeteria every
day,” said Pitt student Diane Boyle.”There’s more variety
without having to go out and pay cash for it.”

Beavers said many Oakland establishments, such as Baskin-
Robbins and Pizza Hut, have shown interest in participating.
Nonelhave committed as of yet.

Choice Dollars can be purchased at the meal ticket office and
_can also be used to purchase meal tickets for the Towers and
Lothrop dining halls. For off—campus students or students with
another meal plan, there is a. $50 minimum. . A

T For residence—hall students without another meal plan, there
is a $250 minifnum. Additional choice dollars can be purchased
throughout the semester.

Japanese and has written
several books about
Japanese literature and
culture.

“We have a really great
Asian studies Program at
Pitt,” he said. Rimer said
his main goal is to build the
program so that students
know the Japanese
language and have a real
sense of what life is like in
Japan. .

“I want students to learn
more about Japanese
culture because that’s how -
Japanese people think,” he
said. »

“I think they’ll do muc
better in their work and
their research if we could

build up that aspect of the
program.”
Rimer said many

American students are
interested in learning about
Japan.

“We have more students
in the language than we
can possibly accomm-
odate,” he said.

Rimer said he was glad
to take the position at
Pitt because Pittsburgh
was originally his
hometown.

When he left Pittsburgh
to attend college, his family
moved out of state and he
hasn’t been here since the
19505.

“It’s wonderful to

War before the discussion was
opened to audience members.
Despite the efforts of the PSfP to
maintain neutrality, Major Robert
Murray of Pitt’s ROTC found
himself alone on the pro—force
side of the argument after illness
caused GSPIA’s Michael Brenner
to stay home.

Murray said that he spoke only
from his experience as a three-
month observer and participant
in Desert Storm and repeatedly
defined his role as a soldier.

“I’m not called upon to conceive
policy,” Murray said. “As a soldier,
I don’t judge policy as right or
wrong. I don’t have that luxury. I
can only execute it and hope that
it was right.” Murray’s speech
was largely historical in nature.
“Being a soldier, I know only the
options that I was given. I can’t
comment on what could have
worked or might have worked. I
can only tell you what did work,’f
he said.

The objectives of the war were
the immediate departure of Iraq

.from Kuwait, the restoration of

pre-war territorial boundaries, the
restoration of Kuwait’s legitimate
government and reassurance from
Iraq that such “offensive

misadventures” would inot be
repeated, according to Murray.
The major admitted that while
the first three objectives were
rather clear, the fourth objective
was “open to interpretation.”
To Murray, military actions were
almost an inevitability. “There
was no movement on the part of
the Iraqis to leave Kuwait. It soon
became apparent that military
operations would be necessary."
Murray described the level of
destruction in Kuwait as
“significant” and said that the
destruction would have been

.‘‘much, much worse” if the United

States had given Hussein more
time to withdraw. “I can assure
you that no American soldier
takes combat lightly,” Murray said.
A member of the audience later
commented on the lopsided
debating strengths of the panel.
Bush said that every attempt was
made to create balance and that
the PSIP actually had to reject
some faculty members who
wanted to speak against Desert
Storm. ,
Bush said she even asked some
ofthe panelists who spoke against

emilitary action to “play devil’s
advocate” and speak in favor of

Desert Storm, but none would.

Murray also made it clear that
his views did not represent “a
monolithic ROTC position” and
that the large number of cadets in
the audience were not there to
offer organized support to Murray.

“They’re here at the invitation
of the organizers, just like any
other students,” Murray said. Bush
said that she and other PSfP
members put fliers announcing
the event in the ROTC’s
mailboxes.

Sandra Halperin of the political
science department said the
debate that lingers after the Gulf
war is not about whether or not
removing Iraq from Kuwait was
good. The real debate, according
to Halperin, is about whether the
use of force was preferable to the
alternatives.

“Out of many alternatives, our
government‘ chose the least
desirable policy,” Halperin said.
The U.S. government chose the
military option “because it was
the most dynamic way way to

show U.S. resolve against anyff

attempts to change the status
quo,” according to Halperin, who
described the war as a “feel-
good, action—packed media
event”

Halperin said keeping Saddam
Hussein and other despots in
power was in the U.S. national
interest “because they are so
effective in controlling their
populations.”

The government is still “spoon-
feeding” incorrect information
about the causes, evolution, and
consequences of the Gulf war,
according to Halperin. Because
the media do not independently
research war events, Americans
still get only “rehashed, recycled
misinformation” about the war.

Most of Halperin’s speech was
spent attacking popular
arguments in favor of military
action.

“exacerbated conﬂict”

Desert Storm did nothing to
enhance U.S. prestige, Halperin
said. “No one doubted that the
U.S. would use force. No one
thinks better of us, either.”

Halperin said the United States
wasn’t coming to the aid of a
friend when it invaded Kuwait.
She described the Kuwaiti
government as “anti-democratic,
anti-American, [and] feudalistic.”

To say that Desert Storm helped
to bring about the Middle-East
peace conference is “an incredible
distortion of the facts,” Halperin
said. In reality, trends toward
peace in the Middle-East pre-
date the war and actually occurred
“in spite of the war,” according to
Halperin.

Halperin said Saddam Hussein
would have sold oil at low prices
because he needed oil revenues
for infrastructural improvements,
thus invalidating the argument
that the war was necessary to
ensure a cheap oil supply.
Appeasement analogies drawn
between Saddam Hussein and

“Hitler arelinvalid because they

omit external‘ constrain-ts-on
Saddam’s ambitions, Halperin

said.

Those who argue that the
United States had to fight Iraq so
th-at aggression wouldn’t be
allowed to continue forget that
we allowed aggression to persist
for eight years during the Iran-
Iraq war, Halperin said.

Middle East,
Halperin.

Desert Storm “left the problems
as a ticking time bomb to explode
in the face of future generations,”
she said.

Iris Young of GSPIA said that
the Gulf war was “a senseless,
stupid war” and a year’s
retrospection hasn't changed her
mind.

“The war accomplished one
thing: It got Iraq out of Kuwait.
This objective was achieved at
enormous costs. There is no
evidence that this couldn’t be
done by other things,” Young
said.

Young called the Gulf war “the
most popular war since World
War II” and said the “manufacture
of consent” through mass media
was critical in keeping it that
way.

“Before the war, people’s
opinions were extremely divided”
but any division was “blanked
out of memory once‘ the war

according to

began,” Young said. A
An example of what Young

called “consent'b'y deceit” was
the televised Senate testimony of
an “anonymous” Kuwaiti girl who
described horrible atrocities on
the part of the Iraqis, including
the throwing of babies from
hospital incubators. Recent
reports indicate that the girl is
actually the daughter of the
Kuwaiti ambassador to the United
States. »

Young said such deceit causes
the public to think, “If they’re like

that, they deserve a war against
them.”

Public consent was also
manufactured through racism and
incorrect information, both of
which materialized in the form of
xenophobia against Arabs living
in the United States, she said.

“In order to make war more
comfortable for Americans, the
Iraqi people had to be presented
as not quite human,” Young said.
As an example of this
dehu manization, Young told of a
National Public Radio reporter
who said that the United States

.managed to minimize human

casualties in the Gulf war.

“He should have said ‘American
casualties,” Young said. “He
slipped." _

Young said that the denial of
information to the American press
was actually worse than
censorship because the media
didn’t even have material of their
own to censor. “The media went
right along,” she said.

“The American people were
fired up” and had no opportunity
to‘ know the extent of the
destruction in Iraq, according to
Young, who said the war was
presented as nothing more than
“a sports event.”

“One of the key aims of whatl
call ‘Operation Desert Massacre’
was not simply the restoration of
the feudalistic aristocracy of
Kuwait. In George Bush’s own
words, we wanted to create a
‘New World Order,”’ said Jules
Lobel of Pitt Law School.

\

Lobel is one of 50 lawyers who

‘filed a lawsuit against President  

Bush for going to war against the
Constitution. . - g
In his argument, Lobel drew an

analogy between the occupation I S

of Kuwait by Iraq and the “illegal”
occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip by Israel and pointed
out inconsistencies in US policy
in dealing with both. “Nobody is
lifting a finger to sanction Israel,”
Lobel said.

“It is my contention that the
present Israeli government
doesn’twant peace. In fact, peace
is the worst thing that can happen

to them,” Lobel said, pointing to I

Israeli stubbornness in the Middle
East peace talks.

Lobel accused Israel of
“systematically changing the
character of the Occupied

Territories” through illegal_

settlement and deportations and
said U.S. aid to Israel was
subsidizing human rights abuses
there. I

“We were successfulin getting V
Iraq out of Kuwait but not in Av A

advancing the rule of law and
peace in the MiddleEast,” Lobel

said. He concluded his talk by.

saying that the Gulf war was a
“policy in vain” and countless
other soldiers like Murray will
continue to fight and die in the

Middle East as a result of that I

policy:

A candlelight vigil in front of

honor of all those who died in the

George Bandik is now living
his dream of teaching at Pitt’s
chemistry department.

Bandik said teaching chemistry

is something he’s “always wanted

to do.” V

He grew u p in North Braddock
and did his undergraduate work
at Penn State.

He said his desire to get away
from Pittsburgh for. a
while prompted him to enroll
there.

He earned his undergraduate
degree in biological chemistry
from Penn State in 1980,.and
came to Pitt for his graduate
studies.

He has been here ever
since.

A The coordinator of the
undergraduate chemistry
program at the time, Dr. Safford,
was planning on retiring.

Bandik was attracted to Pitt
because he was offered Safford’s

job.
Bandik describes Safford as his
role model for teaching.

Bandik greatly admired
Safford’s personal interest in all
of his students and tries to emulate
him in his classroom and by
having an open-door policy at
his office.

“I think that’s very important. I
try to have a lot of interaction,”
said Bandik, although he admits
it’s very hard to make his classes
personal when he has 300
students. - «

Bandik teaches a nursing
chemistry class during the fall
term and an organic chemistry
class in the spring and summer
terms.

He is still the undergraduate
program coordinator for the
chemistry department, and he
advises undergraduate chemistry
majors on developing their career
choices.

Bandik is also a faculty adviser
for the Pitt chapter of the American
Chemistry Society Student
Affiliate, a nationwide
organization of chemistry majors
with 845 chapters across the
country. i ‘ ,

He is in charge of the chemistry
department’s Saturday Science
Academy, which brings in
students from local high schools
for hands-on experience in
chemistry laboratories in the hope
of sparking their interests in
science.

Bandik cites the importance of
this program in light of recent
news stories about how America
is falling behind the rest of the
industrial world in science and
technology.

Bandik said this is his way of
reaching out to students who feel
intimidated by science or who
are simply disinterested it it.

Explaining something relatively
complex and having students
understand it is another great
pleasure for Bandik.

When asked what is his all—'

time greatest joy in teaching,
Bandik simply says, “Students,
without a doubt.” '

When CNN chose to hold a live
town meeting it needed to find a
city representative of the rest of
the country, according to Haddad.

“We chose Pittsburgh because
it really reflects what’s going on
in the rest of the nation. Some
people are doing really well;
others are not doing so well. It’s
not the worst-hit city, but it’s- not

they haven't asked me about it, but
it’s been in the news a lot. That

most common questions about
health insurance, politics and Dan

_ Quayle (just for kicks).

What is the big deal with our
health insurance? '
Good question. I'm not entirely
sure what's going on with the health

thats in shambles.

As you can see, this whole mess
is tugging at the heartstrings of
even our representatives. Even
George Bush has attempted to come
up with a plan to get us out of this
mess.’

Oh, yeah? What’s that?

I was getting to that. According
to Sunday’s Pittsburgh Press, Bush
has devised a plan to turn the
whole insurance scam — I‘ mean,
business — over to the private
sector.

How does that solve anything?‘

You see, President Bush hopes

—-that a competitive market will re-
 sult in cheap-but—quality health

insurance, figuring that things like
supply and demand and all that
other stuff you slept through in
Econ 10 will provide mass cover-
age for everyone but still be pretty
low.

Wow. That sounds pretty com-
plicated.

best of us

Then maybe you shouldn’t have
slept through Econ 10. As you can
imagine, the Democrats aren't too
crazy about the whole thing. They
claim (and they probably have a
point) that ‘private enterprise is fine
for selling things like shoes, but not
for health insurance. Which, to
their credit, may explain why the
Democrats have never called for a
national shoe insurance policy.

Then whatdo theDemocrats want
to do? '

The Democrats want to turn over
the burden of health care to the
government, which sounds like it
would be the best of both worlds.
People could still choose their own
doctors, while the feds foot the bill
for all of it. It's basically the same
system they have in Canada.

You mean we stole this idea from
the Canadians? Like we did with
Wayne Gretzky?

Um, I guess you could look at it
like that. I like to think we’re
emulating their system, which
seems to work pretty well.

How well does it work?

Have you ever seen a sick Ca-
nadian?

Good point. What if this system
doesn’t work? Do the Democrats
have a backup plan?

Funny you should ask; as a matter
of fact, they do.

This other plan, called “Pay or
Play” in the Press, makes employ-
ers choose between covering

‘ their employees or contributing to

a big health insurance “pot” that
would cover people without insur-
ance.

Well, that’s enough for now, I A

guess. Heard anygood Dan Quayle
jokes?

No. You’d better wait until the
Democratic convention.

{'23-AA“ ..——_< .4. A

We are fast approaching the be-
ginning of primary season, the stuff
that political junkies live for.
Democrats are going to try and
score big on domestic issues, an
area of perceived weakness for the
president. One of the ways that
Republicans will counter is to try to
ﬂog the Democrats once again with
the “quota issue”. It is absolutely
true that any supporter of affirmative
action is likely to be hurt by" this
issue. The unfortunate thing is af-
firmative action is a good, fair and
just policy that is misrepresented to
the public and misunderstood by
just about everyone.
For about the last 15 years op-
ponents of affirmative action have
been able to frame the argument.
Affirmative action, it is claimed, is
unfair to workers because the most
"qualified people get passed over
for jobs while many unqualiﬁed
people get promoted. It is also
seen as unfair to employers because
they are denied the beneﬁts of
hiring and promoting the best and
most talented workers, thereby
lowering productivity and effi-
ciency. Even the benefiting mi-
norities lose out because they are
not being encouraged to improve
themselves through fair competition
for jobs. Furthermore, those who
are truly talented find their abilities
are unfairly suspected. This all
sounds very convincing, and the
fact that it has almost nothing to do
with reality has not slowed the
criticism.
One of the problems with the

  Mark
Carlin

merit argument against affirmative
action _is that it suggests that for
most jobs there is one clearly quali-
fied candidate. In reality, that is
rarely the case. Most jobs have a
number of fully—qualiﬁed appli-
cants; the trick is picking which
one. This is where affirmative ac-
tion comes in. If a group of people
is qualified, why not give a pref-
erence to some members of dis-
advantaged groups? The point of
affirmative action is not to set ar-
bitrary quotas but to set fair stan-
dards for job eligibility and give
some preference, on occasion, to
members of minority groups that
meet those standards. In fact,
Johnson vs. Transportation, the
most celebrated example of the
courts backing the promotion of a
“less” qualified minority member
over a "‘ more ” qualiﬁed white male,
clearly illustrates this point. The
general media presented this as a
case of a woman who was pro-
moted instead of a man, even
though he had a higher score on a
test given to determine promotions.
What was rarely mentioned was
that she received a 73, and he got
a 75. No one can reasonably sug-
gest that a two—point difference is a

significant indicator of likely job 1

performance. By any reasonable
standard these are equally qualiﬁed
employees, and the business is not

ing quota

Proponents of affirmative action

going to be hurt by promoting the
woman. The Supreme Court rec-
ognized this and upheld the
company's affirmative action plan.
But shrieks of reverse discrimina-
tion were heard as commentators
inveighed against the unfairness of
this decision.

Another problem with the argu-
ments against affirmative action is
they assume that people actually
hire and promote on merit. How
many of you have had to work for
completely incompetent jerks or
watched some blithering idiot get
promoted over a score of genuinely

. talented and hard—working people?

If you thought this might just be a
personal experience which is an
exception to the rule, you’re wrong.
Numerous studies on the psychol-
ogy of hiring have shown that
merit is one of the least considered
factors when deciding who to hire
and promote. In fact, a whole host
of not entirely rational factors enter
into the decision-making process.
Forinstance, the mood of the person
doing the interviewing or how close
someone’s office is to the boss’s
(the closer the better) is sometimes
involved in the decision. The most
important factor in both hiring and
promoting turns out‘ to be how
similar, in terms of appearance,
tastes and interests, someone is to
the person doingthe hiring and
promoting. Merit hiring and pro-
moting sounds great, but most of
us know the real world just doesn’t
work that way.

Since most of the people doing

need support“

the hiring are white males, this
suggests a distinct disadvantage to
minorities. All affirmative action
does is give some preference to the
only people coming to the hiring
and promoting game without

preference. If we hire and promote A ' ' H ‘A

white men for reasons other than

merit, why do we insist on merit _ '

alone for minorities? It is sort of like
saying, “I’ll hire Bubba ‘cause he
can spit real good but not a minority
member because he ain't qualiﬁed.”

Where is the fairness in this? If 

afﬁrmative action programs force

an employer to set standards for 

hiring and promoting, then I don’t.-
see the harm in promoting people
who meet those standards on the
basis of their membership in a
minority group. .

It's almost as if opponents of
afﬁrmative action simply don’t want
to give up their unfair advantage.
Equal opportunity is all well and
good as long as I get mine ﬁrst.
‘There is'an unspoken hint that

white men have a right to jobs and - "I

for everyone else, work is a privi-
lege. Hopefully in this election‘
someone will have the courage to

stand up and defend afﬁrmative‘

action. Hopefully the voters will
not be swayed by misleading and
even racist campaign advertising

againstaffirmative action. Hopefully . 

fairness and justice will not be
treated as issues that only apply to
white men.

      Swimmers

outclass

’ W VU; lose

to Penn St.

By Jim Lakely
Staff Writer

Pitt’s men's swimming and
diving team experienced easy
victory and surprising defeat in
action this weekend.

Friday, West Virginia visited
Trees Pool and was not able to
give the Panthers much of a
challenge, falling by a score of
174-67. Head coach Chuck
Knoles, perhaps in an attempt to
mend his ailing team, did not
enter his best swimmers in their
strongest events but was still able
to cruise to the easy victory.

“I thought we’d have trouble
[against WVUJ but we didn’t,”
first-year student Matt Brady said.

Pitt- placed first in all but two
events and swept four of them.
Winners included Eric Cornell in
the 50-yard freestyle with a time
of 21.74, Jonti Bacharach in the
100 backstroke (54.25) and the
consistent Don Boyd in the 100
breaststroke (59.31).

The Panther divers totally
outclassed the Mountaineers with
a‘rout of their own. Sophomore
Sean Braud won both the one-
meter and three-meter events with
scores of 310.95 and 323.35,
respectively. Senior Phil Cruz
placed second in the one—meter
and third in the three-meter while
Michael Naylor took second and
third respectively in those events.

Saturday’s dual meet with 18th-
ranked Ohio State and a shaved-
and-tapered Penn State team was
not nearly as easygoing for the
Panther swimmers. Penn State
was the overall winner, scoring
142 points. The Buckeyes bested
Pitt by a mere tenth of a second
in the deciding event,'the 400
freestyle relay, to capture second
place.

Itwas even a somewhat difficult
afternoon for the divers. Braud,
who won the one-meter, was
Pitt’s only diver to place in the
event. But the Panthers bounced
back to form on the three-meter
board. Braud, Naylor and Cruz
placed first, second and third,
respectively.

Swimming is a sport where
preparation for a meet is
paramount. Those who train
exclusively for a meet will usually
win. Pitt, more concerned with
peaking for the Big East
Championships next month, did
not consider this a must—win
situation. Penn State, on the other
hand, trained so that they would
peak for this contest, a
development that puzzles Knoles.

“It fails me to think ofa reason
for [that strategyl,” Knoles said.
“They need to prepare for their
own Big Ten championship meet.

“The only way that Penn State
can beat us is to shave and taper,
and that is precisely what they

Panthers deied first Big East road win, 83-79

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

SYRACUSE, N.Y. —Last
year the Pitt Panthers and the
Syracuse Orangemen faced
off in the Carrier Dome to
decide first place in the Big
East Conference. The
Orangemen sent the Panthers

packing back to Pittsburgh

with an 89-68 whipping.

Star forward Billy Owens
scored 33 points and grabbed
16 rebounds, and sporadic
center LeRon Ellis contributed
19 points and 13 boards to
the Syracuse victory.

Saturday, the.Panthers and
the Orange faced off again in
the Carrier Dome for a shot at
first place in the conference.
This time the game was closer,
but the result was the same as
Syracuse handed Pitt an 83-
79 loss. The Panthers have
now lost three games in a
row at the Dome after winning
their three previous contests
in the building. *

The loss dropped the
Panthers to 11-6 on the year,
3-2 in the Big East Conference,
good for fourth place.
Syracuse pulled into a tie for
the top spot with the shocking
Villanova Wildcats, improving
their overall record to 13-1 ,5-
1 in conference play. The
Orange’s only loss this year
was to the Panthers on Jan. 8
at the Civic Arena.

Like last year, two players

stepped forward to lead the

Orangemen. First-year
phenom Lawrence Moten, a,
virtual unknown when the
season began, poured in 32
points and snagged 10 boards,
and highly-touted forward
David Johnson added 21
points and 10 rebounds of
See Game, page 16

SYRACUSE, N.Y. ——Outside
the Carrier Dome the
temperature’ was below
freezing and, to make matters
worse, a 12-inch snowstorm
was brewing.

Inside the Dome, however,
there was plenty of heat, most

of it coming from the hands of

Syracuse first-year player
Lawrence Moten, who scorched
the Panthers for 32 points,

including 20 in the second half

as the Orangemen avenged
their only loss of the season.

“This was just a heckuva win, ”
Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim
said. ‘‘I think that Pittsburgh's
by far the best team we’ve
played this year —— it’s not
even close.”

Said Moten: “They’re one of

the best teams because they’re
bigger than us and they know
how to use their strength —-
that’s to get the ball inside to
their big guys.”

This was a game that Pitt
could have won. Heck, they led
44-41 at the half. But Syracuse’s
first-year sensation 'Moten
played like a man possessed.
He went 14 for 18 from the free-
throw line, grabbed ten
rebounds, dished out three
assists, blocked two shots and
had one steal. He had help
though, from teammates David
Johnson and Adrian Autry. The
three players combined for 69
of Syracuse’s 83 points.

Moten, who set a Syracuse
first-year player scoring record,
is a virtual lock for the Big East
Rookie of the Year award.
“Lawrence is pretty good,”
Boeheim said modestly. “This

[was] his kind of game.”

“I love these type of games,”
Moten said. “That's what the Big
East is all about. I’m glad to be
a part of it.”

The Panthers, however, have
their own rookie sensation in
Orlando Antigua, who came off
the bench Saturday to lead the
Panthers in scoring with 18
points. Antigua may have also

- worked his way into the starting

lineup because in 22 minutes of
action, his contribution consisted
of four rebounds, one assist and
a blocked shot.

Antigua has come on of late.
Over the last seven games he
has converted nearly 81 percent
of his free—throw attempts.
Against the Orange, he went
four-for-five from the stripe. In
the second half he only managed
to score six points and ran into
foul trouble. Then again, he had

Moten, Antigua making big impressions

By Brandy L. Simms
Staff Writer

the unenviable task of trying to
guard Moten and senior guard
DavidJohnson, a preseason first-
team all-conference selection.
“Antigua really hurt us early,”
Boeheim said. “That was the big
disappointment that we had.”

Boeheim and his troops, at 5- —

1, now find themselves in a tie
with Villanova for first place in
the conference standings.

However, both Pitt and
Syracusewere predicted to be
near the bottom of the
conference standings. Granted,
the conference regular season is
far from ovér, but the Panthers
and the Orangemen are a lot
better than people thought they
would be.

“Pittsbu rgh’s very, very good,”
Boeheim said. “Both these teams
will prove by the end of the year
that the preseason picks might
not have been too accurate.”

I even had a good weekend,

Now the sports world has to go
and get me upset. Actually, it was
that Towers cafeteria food and

0The firing of
Pirates GM Larry
Doughty upset
me. I have to
rename my

sue me.) The thing that bugged
me is that it reportedly wasn’t
said boneheaded move (the fiasco
leading to three prospects —
including Wes Chamberlain ——
going to Philadelphia for Carmelo
Martinez) or his other ones that
earned him the boot. Does
anybody remember him trading
three prospects for shortstop Rey
Quinones or the signing of Walt

Yet Doughty definitely had his
moments. Getting veterans Steve
Buechele and Zane Smith was
expensive but necessary. Getting
Jay Bell from Cleveland for Felix
Fermin was a steal. (Then again,
how hard can it be to outsmart
Indian management?) He was GM
for a team that won the last two

Senior Sports Writer

Pitt’s wrestling team is probably
not welcome in the state of Ohio

‘ any longer. The 24th-ranked

Panthers travelled to Ohio
University on Saturday looking
to bounce back from a tough
Eastern Wrestling League opener,
and the result was two huge
victories over Ohio opponents.
In the opener, Pitt came up
with a dynamite 18-16 victory
over 8th-ranked Ohio State, then
took out Ohio University 22-15.
Friday night Pitt lost a hard-fought
match to 20th-ranked Lock Haven,
25-17, at Fitzgerald Field House
in their EWL opener. After a hectic

. weekend, the Panthers’ slate holds
. at 3-2, but the future is looking

strong after Saturday's effort. Head
coach Rande Stottlemyer said

' . beating the Buckeyes was the

biggest win Pitt has had in a long
time. ‘ . , ,

"“4We showed-=a lot of character,
and the camaraderie among the

8 guys was great,” Stottlemyer said.

“It all came right down to the
bitter end and could’ve gone
either way.”

“It’s the best win for us since
I’ve been here, ” Scott Hovan said.
“It was a great performance by
everyone on the team. We just
pulled together and everyone on
the team wrestled great.”

There were a couple keys for
Pitt’s performance against Ohio
State. First, the Panthers found a
way to win the “swing” matches,
something that they haven’t
always done in the past. Saturday
also marked the return of junior
Bobby Simpson to the mat.

‘Simpson won 31 matches as a

sophomore two seasons ago but
missed last season due to
academics. Despite the long lay-
off and lack of workouts, his
impact dented both Ohio St. and
Ohio with Simpson snatching two
Wins. 6
“He gives us experience; we
just don't have anybody until
Steve [Budman]; and.Bobby gives
us a lot more experience,”
Stottlemyer said. “He’s only been

working out since Monday and
steps onto the mat and wins two
big matches.”

Hovan and heavyweight Perry
Miller both wrestled to perfect
weekends. Hovan avenged one
of his three defeats by winning a
rematch with Ohio State’s Ken
Ramsey. Hovan also won a 4-3
decision against Ohio U. Ramsey
is currently ranked third in the
nation at 158 pound weight class,
and Hovan is ranked ﬁfth. Ramsey
defeated Hovan at the Midlands
Championships by a 10-8 margin,
but Hovan came back on Saturday
and, despite battling a case of
bronchitis, won a 3-2 decision.

“We really needed that,”
Stottlemyer said. “He’s been sick
and he wrestled real smart.”

“I didn’t really wrestle that well
atMidlands, I felt,” Hovan said. “I
knew I could beat him. I had to

‘go out and wrestle him smart.”

Although he added three

-victories to improve to 13-3, this
~ weekend was strange for Hovan.

“I usually don’t get into too

_ many one-point matches; it’s kind

THE PI'I'l' NEWS, Tuesday, January 21, 1992

of rare,” Hovan said. “And now I
get three of them in a row.”

Miller posted‘ two more
dominant performances with a 9-
2 decision against Ohio State and
a 15-2 against Ohio. The Panthers
counted on Miller (12-3) time
and time again and he continued
to respond.

“He’s got the eye of the tiger
right now,” Stottlemyer said. “He’s
just Mr. Consistent for us. I keep
telling the guys just stay in it and
he’ll win it for you. Coach
Beichner and I havetremendous
confidence that he’ll do that.”

Sean Gibbs lost a tight match to
the Buckeyes’ Mike Shick (ranked
fourth in the nation), but came
back and hammered his opponent
from Ohio U.

“Both Coach Beichner and I
have been really pleased with his
progress,” Stottlemyer said. “He’s

starting to realize that he can.

wrestle with those top ﬁve or six
-kids in the nation.

First-year wrestler Joe Plouse
turned in a tremendous effort
and earned the first two wins of

his collegiate career: a 7-6 decision
against Ohio St. and a 6-3 decision
against Ohio U. Plouse got off to
a slow start this season when a
broken jaw forced him to miss
almost five weeks of training. But
Stottlemyer said that P1ouse’s
conditioning has improved and
he was very pleased by his
progress. Stottlemyer has been
satisfied with the improvement
of his younger wrestlers but
stressed that the upperclassmen
must continue to raise their
performance level.

“We’re gonna win with our
upperc1assmen,” he said.
“Anything that these other guys
give us is icing on the cake.”

The Panthers expected a stern
test in their EWL matchup with
Lock Haven, and that’s exactly
what they got. The outcome
turned on one match — the 150-
pound battle between Budman
and Lock Haven first-year wrestler
Pete Ventresca. At this point the
Panthers were down 13-3, but
figured to score in the higher

for the NFL will ,,come out next
month. Based on past history, we
all know the Steelers will take in
only the cheapest talent instead
of doing something to help
themselves. For one example of
a missed opportunity, James
Lofton of the Bills was left
unprotected last off-season. He
probably wouldn’t have wanted
to leave the defending AFC
champs for a team that missed

the playoffs last season, but‘“the
right money offer might have
done it. Lofton could have been
the consistent deep threat the
team lacked.

-Paul Coffey, the most proliﬁc

weight classes. Budman came
out very strong, quickly taking
down Ventresca twice in the first
period for a 4-2 lead. The second
period heated up and Budman
held on to a slim 4-3 margin after
two. Budman appeared to be in
control, but the third. period
proved to be disastrous for the
Panthers with Ventresca pinning
Budman and giving Lock Haven
a huge momentum swing.

“Obviously, I was very
disappointed,” Pitt head coach
Rande Stottlemyer said. “I think
we wrestled well enough to win;
missing Bobby [Simpson] really
hurt us. Obviously, where we
lost the match was 50. We had an
upperclassman wrestling a
freshman and we get pinned.
There’s no way we lose that
match. That’s a nine—point swing.

“.It’s hard to explain; if he just
hangs on to win, we win the meet
by a point.”  .

Stottlemyer felt that
conditioning was a decisive factor
in the outcome, with-this being

only Pitt’s third dual-meet of the‘

season and Lock Haven’s 15th.
Pitt’s big guns were blazing, as
usual. Hovan battled to a gutsy 2-
1 decision over Kemal Pegram.
Sean Gibbs (177) locked up with
Ron Coffel in another tremendous
match. An early takedown left
Gibbs in control from sta-rt to
ﬁnish, but Coffelbattled the entire

match before Gibbs prevailed 3-
1. The duels kept getting more
intense and climaxed at the 190-
pound weight class with Jeff
Kloiber up against Lock Haven
junior Dale Budd, who was
named the EWL’s Wrestler of the
Week. Kloiber’s' takedown put
him up 2-0, but Budd quickly
reversed him to knot the match at
2-2. Kloiber earned one point for
an escape and led 3-2 after the
first period. In the second, Budd
again reversed Kloiber and
appeared in control with a 4-3
lead. The third period intensified,
and when the horn sounded, the
match ended in a 5-5 draw.

“That guy was really tough; I
lost to him 4-3 last year,” Kloiber
said. “I felt like I should’ve really
beat him this time. I'll see him
again at the EWL’s."

Miller continued to dominate
against undefeated Larry Walker
(80). Miller wrestled aggressively
throughout the ﬁrst period and
owned a 3-2 lead after one. Then
Miller struck with the swift and
sudden decisiveness that made

him an All-American last season .

and pinned Walker :31 into the
second period.

“We’ve proved ourselves
because of what we did out at-
Ohio,” Miller said. “A lot of the
guys are relaxed now and are
used to the atmosphere, so they’re
going hard. This was a big
conﬁdence _boost.”

remain out of the lineup with a
shoulder injury.

Geubtner credits the “no
pressure” atmosphere that
surrounds the team for her
improvement. “He [Belowich]
doesn’t put a lot of pressure on
us," Geubtner said. “If anything,
I think it comes from within. If
you do your best, then inevitably
it’s gonna work out for the team.”

Yet another pleasant surprise
for Pitt was the efforts of Margaret
McClurg and Laura Zdyb in the
1000—yard freestyle.

McClurg, a sophomore from
Lakeland, Fla., finished second
with a time of 10:43.65, while

Zdyb, a first-year distance
swimmer from Acton, Ma., placed
third in the event.

This unselfish attitude is a
common thread that binds this
group of athletes.

Senior captain Janine Atiyeh
admitted that while the team has
fewer swimmers than in past
years, the team is staying positive;
looking not for excuses, but
solutions. “In a way, [with fewer
swimmers] it’s good and in a way
it’s bad,” Atiyeh said. “It really
forced us to get together as a
team. Recently we regrouped,
totally set our goals this week —
— on Big Easts and the rest of the
season —— and everyone pulled

together tonight.”

This “pulling together" idea was
evident in the performance of
Christy Knobloch. Knobloch
placed first in the 200-yard
backstroke and second in the 200
butterﬂy.

Another Panther who delivered
was senior captain Laura-Lee
Sullivan, who won the 200-yard
breast stroke and took second in
the 200-yard individual medley.
Sullivan was also part of Pitt's
winning 400—yard medley relay
team.

Renne Ric/rcio, who captured first-

speciﬁc parts of our racing Istarts,
finishesl,” Belowich said. “As for
tonight, it was nice to win, but it’s
nicer to win when you overcome
adversity.”

The adversity he is referring to
is the number of injuries the team
has incurred over the year, as
well as the loss of two swimmers
who quit the team (Jill Comeau
and Julie Rocks).

“We’ve really gone through
some turmoil this year,” Belowich
said. “And the way they overcame
that and performed tonight, I’m
very, very proud of them.”

Pitt returns to action next
Saturday at home against Big East
favorite, Villanova.

Game———

Continued from page 12
his own.

This year’s contest was close
the entire way. Neither Pitt nor
Syracuse enjoyed a lead greater
than eight points in the entire
contest, and there were 11 lead
changes and eight ties.

“We just aren’t doing the little
things,” Pitt head coach Paul
Evans said. “We just didn’t match-
up with those two guys [Moten
and Johnson] tonight, and it hurt
us.”

The. game started out with the
two teams trading baskets until
the 16:03 mark. At that point,
Syracuse went on an 11-2 run
capped by a Moten layup to take
their biggest lead of the game at
19-11 with 13:59 to play in the
half.

The Panthers then began to
chip away at the lead, eventually
regaining the lead at the 5:23
mark when an Orlando Antigua
layup made the score 30-29.
Antigua led the Pitt comeback
effort with eight points Over that
stretch.

The Panthers extended their
lead to as much as eight before
going into the locker room with
a 44-41 advantage. .

Moten led the Orangemen back
in the second half. After the
Panthers opened up a five-point
lead on a driving layup by forward
Chris McNeal, Moten completed
a three—point play on a layup and
a free throw after a Jerry
McCullough foul.

The lead switched back and
forth until the 4:46 point. After
Sean Miller hit two free throws to
give the Panthers their ﬁnal lead
of the game at 73-71, Moten
canned arreight-foot jumper and
converted a free throw that
resulted from a Gandhi Jordan
foul to give Syracuse a 74-73
advantage which they never
relinquished.

Pitt threatened late in the game _

but could not convert. After a
McNeal jumper cut the Orange’s
lead to two points at81—79, Moten
made one of two foul
shots,puttin'g Syracuse up by three
with 21.9 seconds left. The
Panthers inbounded with a
chance to sink a three—pointer to
tie the game.

McCullough, however, decided
to drive baseline and had his 15-
footer blocked by Moten to kill
the Panthers’ hopes.

“We were playing for the three,”
Pitt center Darren Morningstar
said. “Some people got out of the
offensive set, and Jerry tried to
make something happen."

did. On even ground, Pitt is
decisively better.”

“We are not going to
disrupt our season because Penn
State decides to shave,” Brady
said.

But even a shaved-and-tapered
Nittany Lion team could not
outrace Pitt by much. They won
many of their races by very close
margins. According to the
coaches, the meet was a valuable
learning experience.

“Emotionally, it is a big kick in
the teeth,” Knoles said. “We swam
as fast as we could and still got
beat. It really left a sour taste in
our mouths. Why did we have to
compete on uneven grounds?”

Knoles seems anxious to get
another chance at the Panther’s
rival.

“We will outscore Penn State at
the NCAA’s,” he said.

“Going against a shaved team,
we were still able to hang very
tough,” assistant coach Mark
Davin said. “It pushed the guys to
swim faster. We are on the right
track and it would be nice to kick

-Villanova’s butt next week.”

Despite the sour feelings, the
coaches were pleased with Pitt’s
showing against Ohio State. The
Buckeyes, like Pitt, also did not
shave and taper for this meet, so
the level of competition was very
close, with the difference being
decided in the ﬁnal relay.

“It is important to go head to
head with a top 20 team when
you haven’t done that before,”
Knoles said. “I was very
encouraged with the way they
hung with Ohio State.”
