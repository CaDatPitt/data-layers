Legislators Rekind|eThoughts of ‘Tuition Credit Plan

. By SUE McFARLAND

Pitt News Staff Writer

HARRISBURG—The possibility

, of a type of tax credit plan is being

rekindled in the mind of at least
one legislator if state-related
universities do not receive an
increase in appropriations for the
coming year.

Rep. Ivan Itkin (D-Allegheny)
initiated the tuition credit proposal
two years ago when fear arose that
state colleges and universities
would be forced to drastically
increase tuition because of low
state appropriations.

“The tuition increase wasn’t
necessary because the appropria-
tion was above and beyond what we

provided for the universities
originally,” Itkin said from his

. Harrisburg office. “But this year if

we have to give more money we
might as well give it to residents in
the form of a tuition credit.”

Itkin said legislators will not be
hasty in passing a tuition credit
plan unless they are first assured
that it is the only alternative.

“We are not in the type of
situation whereby the universities
scream for money and we just go
ahead and provide it,” Itkin said.
“The administration will be subject
to intensive interrogation before
the‘ house appropriations commit-
tee and if there is a definite need

New Draft Legislation:
Antlnvasion of Privacy

By JOHN RIGHETTI
Pitt News Staffwriter
Five military service draft bills
currently before Congress may
cause social, economic and ethical
problems, according to participants

in a discussion of the draft push.

' Chaplains

‘the young are different

The discussion, ‘which was
sponsored by the University
Association and the
Pitcairn-Crabbe Foundation, was
held Monday in the Student Union
Venetian Room.

One bill could possibly invade
privacy, permitting the Selective
Service System to investigate all
draftee records, including school
and mental health records, said
participant Thomas Kerr.

Kerr is a professor in Carnegie-
Mellon University's Graduate
School of Industrial Administra-
tion.

“In essence, this bill is saying
from
everyone else. They can be denied
privacy,” Kerr said. “Waiving
(privacy) would be a serious
intrusion into the lifestyle of these
people.”

Should the United "States, Kerr
then asked, “a democratic nation,
create this involuntary and compul-
sory act in peacetime?”

Kerr referred to problems
conscientious objectors would have
with any new draft systems, calling

the push for a draft “a Catch-22 '

situation.’ ’

He stated that, since new draft
registration would be computer-
ized, conscientious objectors would
have no opportunity to state their
objections until they are actually
drafted.

“Then, when he (the objector)
goes before the board with his
objections, they can say to him
‘Why didn’t you mention this
before? You’re just saying that

-_:Inside today ’s Pitt News

now that you’re drafted,’ ” Kerr
said.

He advised young people con-
sidering themselves conscientious
objectors to write a letter stating
their objections to military service
and file it with a spiritual advisor or
counselor to document proof that
the objection/decision was made
long before they are drafted.

Kerr also commented on a
national service bill which is
related to the ﬁve military draft
bills before Congress, requiring
some form of nationalservice for all
young people.

The bill would require either
military or civilian service—for
example, service in the Peace Corp
or Volunteers In Service To
America program, he said.

“National service appeals to the
public,” Kerr said. f‘I guess
people over 30 think it's dandy. But
it may be a violation of the 13th
Amendment, which doesn’t state
you have to be an ex-slave.”

The 13th Amendment states,
“Neither slavery nor involuntary
servitude, except as punishment
for crime whereof the party shall
have been ‘duly convicted, shall
exist within the United States or
any place subject to their jurisdic-
tion.”

Kerr proposed that the push for
the reinstitution of military draft
was more an economic move than
military.

“It’s supposed to be a way of
keeping the young off the streets,”
Kerr said.

In concluding, he stated that the
cost of reinstituting the draft would
be an enormous burden on the
American people in a time of
inﬂation.

after that we will institute the

“But it will only be if and when
these adminstrators can make a
legitimate argument.”

The tuition credit plan would call
for $50 to be subtracted from the
students invoice each term. This
credit‘ would be given to all
Pennsylvania residents who are
full-time students at any state
school. Part-time students would
receive a proportional amount of
credit for each course enrolled in.

There would be no income
restrictions and the credit program
would not effect the Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance

Agency (PHEAA) loans or grants
received by many students.

“We have many people in
Pennsylvania who have made it
clear they want legislators to be
more efficient in spending dollars
even if the projects are worth-
while,” Itkin said. _

Richard Chess (D-Allegheny)
advocated increasing the number
of grants to students enrolled in
state-owned or related schools.

“Instead of giving thelincrease
across the board we’ll give it in
grants,” Chess said. “Let Pitt
decide how much it costs to operate
and we’ll do that instead of giving
it to the university in one lump sum
with no predetermined purpose.”

Chess said he is not in favor of
increased appropriations to higher
education-

“From how I read my district I
don’t think it is warranted,” Chess
said. Robb Austin (D-Westmore-
land) is uncertain how the
legislators will move on appropria-
tions to higher education.

I “You’re looking at a person who
is very much in favor of increased
appropriations for higher educa-
tion,” he said. “I have no
problems with that but I do have a
problem with (Gov. Richard)
Thornburgh’s approach to taxes.

Gymnast Still Seeks Pitt Aid

By TOM McALO0N
‘ Pitt NewsStal'fWriter

A former Pitt gymnast paralyzed
as a result of a 1972 accident at
‘Trees Hall said “absolutely no-
thing” has happened since he
staged a sit-in in the Cathedrals
Commons Room, demanding and
ﬁnally winning an audience with

Chancellor Posvar last October.

Thomas A. Cardamone, 26, of
Bethel Park, occupied the Com-
mons Room October 20 to protest
the lack of movement in his quest
to have a negligence suit against
the University settled out of court.

Cardamone lost the use of his
legs and arms after falling from a
pair of exercise rings in 1972 while
practicing with the gymnastic
team.

t“Posvar promised to help in

whatever ways he could,’ said
Cardamone. ,

Since that meeting, Cardamone
said, the only help Posvar has been
able to offer has been of an
educational nature “for which I am
very grateful.”

Posvar has offered Cardamone,
who ‘graduates in April‘ with a
degree" in education, help in
pursuing a Masters degree. But,
according to Cardamone, Posvar
has been unable to help ﬁnancially,
because this would cause a
“conﬂict of interest” with pending
court decisions.

Cardamone lost his negligence
case against Pitt 10-2 in Jan. 1978.
On Aug. 3, Common Pleas Court
Judge John P. Flaherty denied a
retrial motion and Cardamone’s
lawyer, Louis R. Tanasi Jr., is now
preparing for a retrial proposal

before the State Superior Court.

The appeal is based on three
discrepancies.

First, William W. Faulk Jr. and
Charles Erny, two jurors for the
trial, knew or worked with the
Cardamone family and should have
been disqualified, Ca-rdamone
claims. Flaherty permitted the jury

to go home after presentation of .

evidence, then returned them to

deliver their verdict. - Third, the '

matter of paid insurance payments

was introduced early to sway the

jury, Cardamone believes.
Another decision pending before

~ State Supreme Court deals with the

equity aspect of Cardamone’s
three-segment lawsuit. Two other
aspects of liability and damages are
covered by the pending retrial case
before the State Superior Court. '

Romance, warmer weather and final exams draw

Austin believes the budget
should first be ﬁnalized before
passage of such tax increases.

According to Austin, Republican
control of the House will be a
deciding «factor if Pitt and other
state-related schools gain more
appropriations.

“The Republicans arenot going
to stop the governor and say they
don’t agree with him on his tax
plan or his plan for higher
education,” Austin said. ,“And the
Democrats just don’t have the
votes. So without some type of

won’t see any type of increase.”

“I might like to think that a
lesson was learned from last year,
which was a real mess when the

universities ended up raising
tuitions and paying back loans at
higher interest rates. ”

Students from the Common-

» wealth’s state-related schools con-

verged on the Capitol Monday to
lobby for increased appropriations.

Among those students were mem-
bersof Pitt’s Public and Govern-
mental Relations Committee who
canvassed the offices of legislators
from Western Pennsylvania.
Although lobbying for the same
purposes, students from the

House Majority Whip James
Mandarino (D-Westmoreland)
does not believe the “bad
press” given the Common-
wealth by the Penn State public
relations department will ad-
versely effect the chances of
_ state-owned and ~state-related
schools from receiving increas-
ed ‘appropriations. .

The controversy occurred
when officials at Penn State
began a massive media lobby
to secure more appropriations

‘for the coming fiscal year.

In a letter to Stanley
Ikenberry, senior vice-chancel-
lor for administration at Penn
State, Mandarino cited the
public relations ploy as contain-
ing “misleading” and “self-
serving” information.

“Unfortunately, your cam-
paign is likely to hurt your
cause and the overall cause of
higher education,” the letter

reads. “for it belittles what is,
in fact, our state’s signiﬁcant
program, and your -reactions
will only confuse the general
public about Pennsylvania’s
general posture toward higher
education.’ ’

“Penn State wasn’t the only
school carrying on this type of
activity but it is the only school
that I actually saw the
literature that was circulated to
the media,” Mandarino said
from his Harrisburg office
Monday. “I. ,don’t think the
efforts by Penn State really did
justice to the status of the
contributions that are made by
the Commonwealth to higher
education . ’ ’

Mandarino cited what he
believes is a strong legislative
commitment to supporting
state-related and state-owned
schools.

Of the total $5.4 billion
general budget for,the current
year, 49.5 percent ($2.6 billion)
was devoted to education,

’ cutbacks, ’ ’ Mandarino’s letter

according to Mandarino. Of
that amount, 22 percent ($592
million) was devoted to higher
education. Mandarino said this
means that one half of all
spending goes to education,
where it must compete for
money with transportation,
welfare and health services.
“The background informa-
tion sheet included in one press
kit points out that since 1972
the university has been requir-
ed to make more than $19
million in internal budget

read. “Yet, in the cover
memorandum to the press kit,
you suggest that Penn. States’ ,

deavor to offer editorial writing ,
assistance to newspapers.”

‘‘If this is what Penn State
employees do with their valu-
able time,” he added, “one.
can only assume that there. is
room for more budget cut-
backs.”

“There are surviving veterans of

. the Ho‘Chi Minhiperiod (in North

Vietnam) who have a vision of
unification,” he stated. k"‘(It is) a
natural transition of development

~ to turn French (North Vietnamese
thought) into a new federation of

allied Indo-Chinese states, a
federation of great states so as to
have more importance and weight
in that section of the world.”

Existence of such’ attitude, he
said, may cool down the Vietnam-
ese situation and prevent escala-
tion, including one that would
involve the Soviets: ' '

“Not to take into account
(uniﬁcation factors in Indo-China)
is to lower yourself to the CIA level

of intellect,” Lattimore comment-
» ed. 2

He also argued for more
complete analytical processes by
journalists, political analysts and
other world political thinkers, not
only with regard to Indo-China but
all world nations.

“We have to allow for...
common-sense analysis not only in
Vietnam and Indo-China but all
over the world. ‘ (We need) really
enlightened, progressive political

perception in America and Eur- '

ope,” Lattimore said.
Toward Indo-China particularly,

state-related schools actually work-
ed against their counterparts from
the ‘state-owned schools. 

Pitt students argued that while
state-owned schools received a
seven percent increase under
Thornburgh’s I proposed budget,
the four state-related schools
received only a 4.6 percent
increase.

Also included in the committees
argument was that Pitt’s School of
Medicine has received no increase
in the past five years although its
tuition has gone up 284 percent.

Many of the legislators believe
that colleges and universitieh’
should carry the responsibility of
implementing internal cutbacks.

Pitt students answered these
requests by citing the proposed
closing of the Titusville campus
and the curtailment of the
Alternative Curriculum program as
major cuts at Pitt.

The theme of the lobbyists trip to
the capitol was to “sell” Pitt to the
lawmakers.

Lobbyists cited Pitt as the largest
employer in the city, generating
almost $102.2 million each year for
the state and $27.8 million for th
city and county. ‘

The» Public and Governmental
Relations Committee will continue
its lobbying trips to Harrisburg
until a ﬁnal decision is made
concerning appropriations.

Slno-Chinese political expert Own Lattimore said Monday there is little chance that current military action in Vietnam
will escalate. Lattimore was at Pitt to address an honors program luncheon;

he said, there exists on the part of
political analysts, “a tendency to
think the lowly Indo-Chinese can’t
think for themselves, that it all
depends on who gets there first,
the Americans or Russians.”

Lattimore added that the attitude
toward Indo-Chinese leaders as
“stooges, puppets, quislings-——is
nonsense.” ‘ I

Pitt News Staff Writer
Pitt’s campus bus will now run
on a set schedule of stops,

according to Student Government.

Board members Cindy DeMatteo
and Tom Kunkel.

DeMatteo and Kunkel, along
with SGB member Helen Gianella,
met with University Parking
Administrator Jan Thomas last
week to ﬁnalize the changes.

The changes, taken from student
recommendations compiled in ex-
SGB member Jan Medoff’s Cam-

pus Bus Survey, include a switch
from a four-runs-per-hour schedule
to three-runs-per-hour.

The bus will now stop at the
Pennsylvania Athletic Association
Building on the hour, and will not
leave until the top of each hour if it
arrives early.

“The bus will be used more if

people can count on it being there
at such-and-such a time,” De-
Matteo said.

The driver, who is allowed an
hour break each day, according to a
contract with ownerJ. W. Schmitt

and Company, will be allotted three
twenty-minute breaks—from 9:20-
9:40 a.m., from noon-12:20 p.m.,
and from 2:20-2:40 p.m.

The new schedule was formu-
lated when it was determined
economically unfeasable to pur-
chase another campus bus to run
through parts of Oakland that the
existing bus did not. 7

“Our original contention was to
purchase a new bus,” Kunkel said.
“But that would cost $57 thou-
sand.”

A By MARK HOLAN
Pitt News Staff Writer
A rally sponsored by the Labor
History Colloquium of the United
Steel Workers of America was held

Monday night to support striking ~

members of the Newport News
Shipyards.

A near capacity crowd filled
Room L-9 of Clapp Hall to hear
local‘and national labor represent-
-vatives describe the strike involving
some nineteen thousand members
of USWA Locals 8888 and 8417.
The strike began last December.

The workers are on strike against
Tenneco, owners of the Virginia
shipyard, the largest navel con:
struction site in the country. The
company has refused to recognize
the union and has denied workers.

The university had paid all of
Cardamone’s bills from June, '1973
to July, 1976, totaling $100,000.
Cardamone said these payments
were “stopped in Oct., 1976.

Cardamone believes his case can
be settled’ out of court by
arbitration.

Clothing and Textile Workers
called the United States Govern-
ment a “union busting agency”
because of its ties to Tenneco
through Navy contracts.

He called for national support for
the workers and an investigation of
Tenneco. '

Dropkin also addressed the issue
of the “non-union horror” in the
South. He said the strike at
Newport News must be won as the
“battle for ' a unionized South
enters a new age.”

After speaking, Dropkin donated
a $1,000 check to Lynn Williams,
Secretary of -the USWA Inter-
national.

Williams, then spoke on the
two-year history of the labor
struggle at”Newport News, claim-
ring that the workers voted
overwhelmingly to unionize over a
year ago.

“I’m just asking for justice and
hoping for arbitration as the tool,”
said Cardamone. “That way any
student injured could use arbitra-
tion as a tool to settle their
grievances.” -

Williams said.

Daniel Marguriet, President of
District Six, United Electrical

ing that the key to progressive
labor was organization of the

He also called for “carloads and
busloads of support” for the
striking workers at Newport News.

New Draft Legislation Found to Violate Rights

“I think it’s interesting to note
that the bill is proposed by Rep.
Paul McCloskey of California,”
‘Donelan said, “and that one of the
‘ideas he has tested for civilian
service projects is young people

that?”

   

" lawn.

Donelan also cited economic
reasons for the draft push.

“Instead of untrained, unem-
ployed 18-year olds coming out of
high school, we’ll have untrained,
unemployed 21-year olds coming
out of the service,” she said.

Donelan stated that the Selective
Service System and the Defense
Department do not want a draft.
She said they have discovered that
a stand-by registration would not
increase mobilization signiﬁcantly
and that they favor the enlistment
program,

“With the enlistment program,
they are getting highly motivated
people who theycan train and who
are going to stay for awhile,” she
said. - “With a draft, the people
would be in-and-out too fast for
them to train to be of much use.

“The only reason so many

The problem is not the quality of

advertisements.’ ’

She also asserted that the draft
will hurt the enlistment program
that brings in motivated indivi-
duals.

“If those who would enlist see a
draft, they'll think there must be
something wrong with the service if
they have to force people to join,”
she said.

Concerning women and -the
draft, Donelan said the military has
always utilized women when
needed, discriminating against

them in certain areas. She said
that women are in combat even
today.

She also stated that the proposed
draft is being used as a weapon
against the passage of the Equal
Rights Amendment.

‘ ‘There are those who tell women
if they support the ERA that they
will be eligible to be drafted. The
government fully intends to draft
women if one of these bills passes.
If it didn’t, the men would take it to
court,” she said.

Palestinians, Israelis

Demonstrate at Film

Campus police responded to a
minor disturbance at Lawrence
Hall Monday night as Israel
sympathizers handed out leaflets
prior to a pro-Palestinian ﬁlm.

The ﬁlm, “The Palestinians,” a
two-hour documentary narrated by
Vanessa Redgrave was presented
by the Anti-Imperialist Student
Union and the Palestinian Solidar-
ity Committee.

Lt. Arie Foreman of the campus
police said ‘after “some dialogue”
was exchanged between pro-Israeli
and pro-Palestinians, police‘ re-
sponded at approximately 7:44
p.m. - i

There were no arrests made.

“It appeared as if it might get
out of hand,” said Foreman. “We
spoke to leaders of both parties and
told them their responsibilities,”
Foreman said. “Both sides
cooperated. ’ ’

Between 15 and 25 members of
the Youth Institute for Peace in the
Middle East and the Pitt Hillel
Club were in the lobby starting
7:30, distributing information in
protest of the film and displaying
posters. P
_ According to witnesses, people
began shouting slogans and pro-
Israeli students responded,’ singing
Israeli songs.

of social response,” Daniel commented. “We
should honor the intellectually talented but not
honor young people as sterile machines with minds of
photographic material.’ ’

Anyone with his eyes open can see the

 deterioration of social concern among students since

the 1960s. While the Vietnam War once served as a
rallying point that spurred doubts about all society’s
institutions, the end of the war has brought a spirit of
ennui with the ‘birth of this decade’s “me
generation.” Everything but thehuman suffering
around them now seems to be the concern of most
students at Pitt. Instead, students crave after the

ellusive high grade average and theweekly drunk at

the inevitable Saturday night party. - .

This growing unconcern breeds the most amazing
ignorance among students, if they are not talking
about a subject directly related to their field of study.
it seems engineers, chemists,
economists or biologists do not care about something
unless they have to know it in order to pass next

-week's final exam. -

As a result, Pitt and other universities are breeding
a world of college educated students unable to cope
in the real world. Although they might know how ‘to
fulfill the specialized tasks required of them in a job,
many students seem unable to think or realize the

impact or importance of theiractions. The students,

become mindless cogs who. fitvnwell into a
bureaucratic maze, but who could ‘never serve as

O

Page 6—Wednesday, March 21, 1979

made their groups all they could be. Now, student
groups are struggling constantly to find members to
keep their ranks filled. When they do manage to find
members, the students often lack the initiative and
energy to make the organization excel and seem in-
tent only on compiling an impressive list of activities
for their resumes.

To even think that these same narrow minded
students are to rule our city, state and nation in the
future is frightening indeed. If they are unable to

_ comprehend theworkings "and problems of student

government profoundly, it seems doubtful these
students can ever solve the problems of energy,
pollution, poverty and inflation that plague our
nation.

Our only hope lies in a problem so large it will
awaken students and show the problems in the world.
Unfortunately, it may be too late for us all when
ignorant people try to solve a problem beyond their
comprehension. ‘

I am writing in response to the
editorial “Grads for sale” and the
subsequent cartoon by Tracy
Franks concerning the University
Placement Office’s public rela-

‘ tions/ advertising program. My

comments will be aimed at
correcting some of your erroneous
assumptions and assertions by

simply relaying the facts about our *

program and the corresponding
results—some of which have
amazed us.

Last summer a marketing re-
search class in the Masters of
Business Administration school
undertook a study for us to
determine the extent to which
small and medium size employers
knew about or used college
placement ofﬁces. We knew that
large employers like United States
Steel and Westinghouse frequently
used our services. However, we
had a feeling there were many

. smaller employers (social services,

small businesses, etc.), which did

not. The research study supported
this theory by showing over 50
percent of the employers surveyed
in the Pittsburgh area was not
aware of college placement offices
in general nor the University of
Pittsburgh’s in particular.

Yet, this same group hired
college graduates annually, many
through employment agencies,
which in turn charged fees to the
students, the employer or both.
This was not a case of employers
by-passing Pitt in favor of CMU,
Duquesne, Harvard or whomever.
It was just a simple fact that they
were not aware of university
placement offices and the service
they could offer. \

In‘ an effort ‘to change this
situation we embarked on an
innovative approach of alerting

” employers to our services through

advertising. The whole thrust
behind this unique campaign was
to encourage employers to call us
when they hadvemployment needs.

An obvious‘ question—is the
advertising working? .

Well, contrary to Franks’ cartoon
which would lead one to believe
that employers would not hire
people from a school that adver-
tises, our campaign is working in a
big way. Consider the following
facts: the advertising through
radio and billboards started on
Feb. 15 and is continuing. In
comparing this time period with the
same_ period a year ago, we can
examine the number of jobs that
have been called into our office.
The following numbers reflectthe
increase in call-in jobs this year
over last:

Sciences V “P 20%
Engineering “P . 53%
Computer Science “P 150%
Business (Both for

Business Majors & -
Liberal Arts) “P 153%

that these percentages reﬂect
increases in real, honest-to-good-
ness jobs. Jobs which we canpost
on our board or to which we can
refer qualified candidates. Jobs for
which our students need not go to
employment agencies or pay a fee.
Jobs which will lead to professional
employment of a good number of
our graduating students. «-

Is this increase in jobs due to our
advertising? Yes, .to- a major
extent. Every job opening called
into _our office is logged as to title,
employer, and how the employer
found out about us. The results so
far show that the great majority of

. employers calling in were stimula-

ted to do so by one of the ads.

If one were to survey the more
than 1,500 students registered with
our ofﬁce, I am sure they would tell
you one of the most difficult things
about looking for employment is to
try and find who is hiring and for
Through the
advertising program, we have
made this part of the search just a
little easier for our students.

Does advertising work in increas-
ing employer awareness of univer-
sity placement offices? You bet!
Does‘ it cause “slick sales meth-
ods” that unfairly coerce employ-
ers into hiring students? No! You
see, there is still an important step
called the interview, which will
always be the ﬁnal stage before
hiring. Our advertising approach is
strictly a way of helping students
and employers get together. The

AdvertisingBrz'ngS ‘Bottom Line’of Greater/1 id forGrads

end result-——whether or not a‘
student is hired—will still be based
on his or her qualifications.

The success of our advertising
program is due in no small part to
the very competent staf of the
News and Publications Depart-
ment. Their efforts have greatly
contibuted to the professional look
that has won praise from employers
exposed to it. It is nice to know that
in a day when highly technical
professional media approaches are
used and expected in every walk of
life that we have such a competent
resource at our disposal.

Finally, it would appear at this
writing that our campaign has
generated a signiﬁcant increase in
jobs being called in. This is
certainly an important criteria in
judging success. However. ano-
ther criteria is how it is viewed by
one’s colleagues. There has been a
good deal of interest expressed by
other college placement offices
around the country in the cam-

paign.
Whether it sets a national trend

’ remains to be seen, butit isa new

method that works in helping
generate greater interest in place-
ment offices by employers. This in
turn means greater assistance for
graduating students, and that’s the
bottom line isn’t it?

Decade Deserves Credit as IstA rea Showcase Club

Mr. Harrison Stackpole’s article

-S “Bar Setting No Place For Big

Name C~ncerts”(The Pitt News,
March 7) does a disservice to the
students in the Oakland area, to the
Decade, and to the concert-goers of
Pittsburgh. Stackpole, clearly, has
no conception of what a “show-
case” club is all about.

Showcase clubs like the Roxy in
Los Angeles, the Agora in
Cleveland‘, the Bijou in Phila-
delphia and the Bottom Line in

New York are widely regarded as J

the best places in the country to see
live music. Unlike acoustically
poor arenas and halls where most
of the audience is hundreds of feet
from the performers, showcase
clubs provide a unique feeling of

intimacy.

Until now, Pittsburgh has had no
equivalent to these clubs. Up and
coming groups either skipped the
Pittsburgh or had to warm up
usually hostile audiences at the
Stanley or Civic Arena. But, now.
some enterprising people are
trying to provide Pittsburgh rock
fans with an opportunity to see
fresh new acts in a smallvenue.

Already such critically acclaimed
groups as Steve Forbert, the
Ramones and the Fabulous Poodles
have dazzled audiences at the

iDecade and more promising new

groups are scheduled to appear.
Best of all, it’s right in our own
backyard-Oakland.

Mr. Stackpole’s conclusions are

generally unfounded and rather
naive. One of his primary
complaints is that he is being taken
advantage of by “exorbitant cover
fees and jacked-up liquor prices.”
Actually, the cover price is $4 and
drinks are $1.25 to $1.75.
Considering the current price of
concert tickets, the cover charge is
a bargain.

Certainly the drinks cost more
than at other Oakland bars, but
they are not showcasing nationally
known rock acts. How does he
think the Decade manages to pay
for these groups? The cover charge
barely pays for the talent—the
Decade has to make money
somehow. Basically, for the cost of
watching a mediocre group in the

last row of the Stanley, you can
share the thrill of an electrifying
perfromance with" those on stage
and have a couple of beers to boot.

With regard to Mr. Stackpole’s
comment about limited seating,
this is in fact one disadvantage. of
showcase clubs. Not everybody
who wants to get in will always be
able to do so. But it is precisely the
limited space of the club which is
its primary advantage.

The club's small size provides for
optimal acoustics (yes, you can
actually see a concert and hear
every word). Even if the club is
packed (as the Decade usually is),
nobody is more than a few feet
away from the stage, so everyone
can see.

Sure the Decade has some
problems. The stage is a littletoo
low and the staff is still a bit
disorganized, but the Decade is‘
just starting out as a showcase
club. There should have been an
article in The Pitt News not only
congratulating the Decade for
ﬁnally providing a spot to see some
of the best new talent in the
country, but also encouraging
anyone interested in live music to
check it out. Mr. Stackpole can
continue to enjoy watching concerts
with binoculars in airplane hang-

. ars. The rest of us can see rock‘n’

roll performed the way it should be.

Reply to Presumptuous Prof and Views on Iran,

Professor Maurice Sussman
complains in his ‘recent letter to
The Pitt News that he is overcome
with a sense of ennui because of my
previous letter, which suggested
that his reach concerning matters
of politics exceeds his grasp. Well,
if it is any relief to Sussman I find
having to respond to his ever more
curious dispatches even more
tiresome.

Sussman charges that I criticized
his style of expression rather than
the substance of his letter. He is
right, of course. That is precisely
what Idid and what I meant to do

and if the reason why wasn’t made

clear in the first letter it should be
perfectly clear now. Sussman’s
initial letter presupposed to teach
my colleague, Richard Cottam,
about Iranian society, politics and
history. He did not claim merely to
be offering an opinion; he claimed
a ‘ superordinate knowledge which
he continues to claim in his most
recent missive. In the Feb. 12
issue of Newsweek, Cottam is
referred to as‘ “one of the
best-informed American scholars
on Iran.” Maybe presumptuous
was ‘not the right word after all;
respond more
properly to ‘ ‘chutzpah. ’ ’

One thing Sussman, and perhaps
Ms. Karen Steed too, need to learn
is that opinions are a proverbial
dime a dozen. Sussman is surely
entitled to his as Ms. Steed is to
hers and that is a part of what
constitutional democracy is about.
But it ought to be recognized as
well that where one person’s
opinions are as worthy as anyone
else’s (regardless of how ill-formed
or non-analytic ‘I they may be),
where the wheat cannot be
separated from the chaff is fool’s
paradise. The right of expression
does not command with it the right
to be taken seriously. «Ms. Steed is
in a lesser position to understand
this, V but Sussman is in a

pre-eminent position to grasp this
point if he is capable of doing so.

In a recent essay in the New York
Times Book Review section, the
historian Paul Robinson wondered
why the “best intellects” (Ein-
stein, Chomsky, etc.) could at the
same time live in two intellectual
worlds———the one of their scholarly
and scientiﬁc endeavors and the

other of their “pop” political
writings. The latter, Robinson
concludes (and I agree), are

maddeningly simple-minded and
intellectually indiscriminate. Why
can people of otherwise great
intellectual distinction be so
intellectually ﬂat when they talk

‘ about politics, history and society?

The answer that Robinson suggests
is that such people often think that
the study of politics, history and
society is not a matter to be taken
seriously, one that anyone may be
able to undertake with relative
ease. Sussman would do well to
read Max Weber, who describes
the vocation of politics as “a strong
and slow boring of hard boards. It
takes both passion and perspect-
ive.’,’ What Weber claims to be
true of the vocation of politics is
equally true of its scientiﬁc and
historical study. Sussman is‘ surely
over-bubbling with passion; it’s his
supply of perspective that is scant.

Equally scant apparently is his’

capacity to distinguish between a
statement describing someone’s
values (as Cottam tried to do with
Ayatollah Khomeini) and norma-

’ tive agreement with the subject’s

outlook.

Speaking of passion,
comments about a bibliography
that I am purported by him to have
found suspect, Sussman produces
both a logical non-sequitur and a
cheap play to emotions. My
original comments on this matter
were in fact meant to be
patronizing in that *Sussman’s
recommended reading for Cottam

in his A

was a bit like bringing two lumps of
coal to Newcastle. Contrary to
Sussman’s presumption, political
scientists spend a good bit of time
thinking about relationships in
society and in politics between the
“secular” and the “sacred.”
Nevertheless, his original inclusion
of Ben-Gurion as someone to read
on the matter of secular-religious
relationships was perversely in-
structive since Ben-Gurion was the
prime minister of. a liberal
democracy which also has many
theocratic elements to its state
constitution. How could Sussman
have missed the irony?
Ultimately, what Sussman offers
up in his letter as a “bibliography”
(I didn’t mean for him to take my
original comments as at request for
morel),
tragedy of the holocaust. This, of
course, is neither a bibliography
nor is it in any way germaneto any
point about the relationship be-
tween religion and state. More-
over, as a co-religionist of
Sussman’s, I am hardly in need of
his gratuitous offering up of an
event that he thinks provides him
with a“ direct pipeline to moral
virtue and correct political judg-
ment. Perspective, if Sussman had
any, would lead him to conclude
that attempts at genocide are
common enough even if none has
been managed on the scale of the
tragedy which befell the European
Jews. ‘ ‘
Sussman’s letter closes on an all
too familiar, if nonetheless, hyster-
ical note regarding the anti-Israeli
responses of the new Iranian
regime. This is no place for an

‘extended discussion of the comp-

lexities of Middle Eastern politics
although I, trust that Sussman
might grant that
complexities. But _it is a proper
place to disabuse Sussman of the
view that there is an easy equation
between anti-Zionism and anti-

is a reference to the

Semitism.

Sussman accuses Khomeini of
religious bigotry, a matter which I
am unable to assess although it
should be noted that upon

Khomeini’s return to Tehran he _

was met at the airport by the chief
rabbis ‘of Tehran and he has also
verbally guaranteed the religious
freedom of the small Jewish and
Christian minorities. From the‘
charge of religious bigotry, I
assume that Sussman is accusing
the new regime of Iran of
anti-Semitism. The evidence he
employs to justify this accusation,
however, is that the new govern-
ment handed the Israeli embassy
over to the Palestine Liberation
Organization, an act of anti-Zion-
ism. Sussman would have to be
even more naive than I think he is
not to realize that the Israeli
government was deeply enmeshed
with the Shah’s- regime and
particularly its security apparatus.

I do not claim that the Israelis may
not have had reasons important to
their own security for undertaking

such deep Israeli involvement in

which conduces to the hostility of

Pitt Prof Stars in LctbTh

’ ~ By MARK Ho. AN

_ Pitt News Staff Writer

Christopher Rawson will be appearing in’ “Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead,” opening this Friday at Pittsburgh Laboratory
Theater. ' «

Rawson. a professor in Pitt's English Department. will be playing
Guildenstern, opposite David Crawford as Rosencrantz. He describes
his character as being highly rational, constantly worrying and
figuring-out probabilities. Rosencrantz. in contrast, is softer and more
accepting.

"Guildenstern is the angles ‘as compared to the curves of
Rosencrantz," Rawson said.

Rawson, in his 11th year at Pitt. said he likes to act whenever
possible. The last play he performed in was "When You Coming Back
Red Ryder" in 1976.

How does Rawson feel about his stage work as opposed to his
classroom duties? ~

“l’m especially happy to be doing ‘Rosencrantz and Guildenstern’
because the play has been worked into many college curriculums,"

999

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, of course, are minor characters in

the Shakespeare play. In this production (written by Tom Stoppard), ’

however, they share the lead.

Interestingly, Stoppard has incorporated the scenes from “Hamlet, "
which Rosencrantz and Guildenstern make appearances into his play.
He has used the original language.

The rest of the play is Stoppard’s own language. It is modern and
does not attempt to be Shakespearian. Rawson described the language
as being “incredibly clever.” . ’

Rawson said he was particularly impressed by word games.

  Greek Week A

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Greek Week got off to a racing start Monday with the annual chariot
race and continued last night with Talent Night—but the big news
is—there’s more to come, folks.

“I think we’ve had a lot of interest expressed in Greek Week--not
only on the part of Greeks, but from non-Greeks as well,” said Greek
Week co-chairman Eugene Manasterski. —

Non-Greek involvement has been exceptionally strong this year.
According to Manasterski, Friday night’s formal at the Hilton Hotel
will include “several tables of non-Greeks in addition to Greeks taking
independents.” Attendance at the formal, incidentally, is well over
900 persons.

Upcoming events include today’s Chugging Contest, which will take
place in various Belleﬁeld and North Dithridge fraternity houses; Fun

, Night; Games People Play; table games such as chess and cards slated

for tomorrow at the Student Union; and Friday’s formal and Saturday’s
Stephen Stills concert at the Stanley Theatre. ‘

Winners for the Chariot Race were the team of Delta Sigma Chi, Phi
Kappa Theta, Sigma Sigma Sigma and Delta Phi Epsilon.

Over 1,121 pints of blood were donated by Pitt Greeks during the
annual Blood drive in January. ‘Fraternities and sororities that
achieved full participation are: Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Chi
Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Zeta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa
Kappa Gamma, Sigma Delta Tau, Sigma Sigma Sigma, Theta Phi
Alpha, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Delta Sigma Chi, Delta Sigma Phi, Delta Tau
Delta, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Kappa Theta, Pi Kappa Alpha and Pi

I .,)Lambda Phi.‘

/

One of the more popular events’ was Monday’s “Hammer Out
Cancer in Your Lifetime,” sponsored by Delta Sigma Chi. Participants
tossed in a quarter to pound a beat up car parked on the Student Union
lawn. Proceeds went to the American Cancer Association. V

‘ ‘Quite a "few people, like myself, whohad tests that day were glad to
drop a couple bucks in the bucket for that,”, Manasterski said.

prompting either a fee increase or a
cutback in services.

Although the Health Service has
received outside funding over the
past three years, this funding is

Robinson. »

The fee was installed in 1977,

way, she said, is to “promote

service.” She added that more
preventional and educational pro-
grams were needed to promote
intelligent use.

“Preventative and Educational
programs will help to make
students aware of which ailments
require treatment and which do
not,” she said. “Students must be

Robinson pointed to the Family
‘Planning Service. as a model of a
ﬂow-cost preventional and educa-
tional program. ‘

“Preventional and educational
programs represent a fair return on
the students dollars and will help
them lead a longer, healthier life,”
Robinson stated.

A staff of three full-time doctors,
eight nurses and two nurse
practitioners provide medical care
ranging from general and internal
medicine to gynecology and der-
matology.

“The goal of the service will
always be to provide good primary
care and education at a cost
effective price,” Robinson said.

Greeks Have Fun at Annual Tlniht Sow ,

By JIM LEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer
“It’s more fun than anything,”
said Greek Week Talent Night
co-chairman Pattie Adair at last
night’s talent night, performed by
several of Pitt’s fraternities and
sororities before a near capacity
audience at the Jewish Community
Center.
A’nd judging from the competi-

tion, it was.

Eight Greek groups performed
musicals and comedy skits to the
theme “The Greatest Show on
Earth.”

Delta Delta Delta, Phi Gamma
Delta ‘and Alpha Epsilon Phi
opened the evening with “You

‘Would Have Done the Same” a

musical number from the Broad-
way show “Chicago.” '
Alpha Epsilon Pi, Kappa Kappa
Gamma, Pi Lambda Phi and Delta
Phi continued the musical trend

with the theme from “Cabaret,”

while Alpha Delta Pi, Sigma Delta
Tau, Delta Sigma Phi, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon and Lambda Chi Alpha
featured Jackie Becker’s vocals in
the haunting song “Moon Dance.”

Comedy took. preference in the
remaining group performances.

Sigma Sigma Sigma, Delta Phi
Epsilon, Phi Kappa Theta and
Delta Sigma Chi brought a
“Saturday Night Live” weekend
update segment to the stage.

Chi Omega, Sigma Chi, and Pi
Kappa Phi did a medley of
commercials while Theta Phi
Alpha, Kappa Delta, Zeta Beta Tau
and Kappa Sigma showed what it
would be like to have The Three
Stooges at a fraternity party.

After Delta Zeta, Pi Kappa
Alpha and Triangle sang ~.“Tele-
phone Hour” the night finished
with Kappa Alpha Theta, Delta Tau
Delta and Phi Delta Theta
performing movie scenes in a
“Masterpiece Theatre” takeoff.

“We really worked hard in the
last month and a half to put on a
smooth Talent Night,” said co-
chairman Chris Maranuk. “And it
went pretty smooth.”

The results of talent night
competition will be announced at
Friday’s Greek Week Formal.

In addition to the regular skits,
there were some unjudged acts
formed by independent Greeks
such as Nagle and the Numbnutz
who performed the Rolling Stones’
“Shattered” and “Brown Sugar.”

“This was a big step for us,” said Dave Wolfson, public

relations director of the Spirit. “We were able to expose ‘

100,000 people to a game that the majority had never seen
before. The reaction of all these people was the same as

Unhappiness Not Always Mentioned in Happy Valley
SDOFIZS SITOFIZS

Anytime a college student has a skirmish with the
law, it’s bound to_be newsworthy, especially when
those students are also football players and they
come from Pitt. But events of the past few weeks
have shown that not all trouble on college campuses
is restricted to the Oakland area. One event, in par-
ticular, has escaped most Pittsburghers.

Several weeks ago, a brief item was buried near the
back of one of the local papers. It dealt with a
freshman football player at Penn State, yes, Penn
State, who had been convicted of rape and morals
charges. Unknown to most, that player had even
been arrested. But such is the case at Penn State and
State College, where there are not" major newspapers
to blurt out news of Penn State footballers and their

I off-the-field exploits.

This little piece of news must interest Pitt followers
who are tired of reading about Pitt players arrested
for one crime or another. But even more interesting

By SAMUEL SCIULLO

    

is that not one of the players has ever been convicted
of that crime in a court of law But opposing schools
are not below bringing up Pitt’s history of problems,
either as a selling point for recruiting, or as am-
munition to fuel anti-Pitt arguments.

Despite the spotless conviction record Pitt owns,
there remains a contingent of people (law-abiding
citizens, opposing coaches, etc.) who voice stark

disapproval when the accused isn’t either kicked off

the team and out of school,,incarcerated, or both.
These people base their opinions on accusations, not
court rulings. This is why the Penn State situation is
rather intriguing. »
Reportedly, the player involved will be suspended

from the team for one year (the article failed to men-
tion any sentencing), but will reinstated to the team
the following season. So what Joe Paterno has done
may be a first in college football history. Hehas
taken a player now with a black and white striped
shirt, made it an indirect redshirt, and will put him in
a blue or white football jersy in two years. Amazing
as it may seem, Penn State, the much publicized
producer of pioused pigskinners, may have a con-
victed rapist on its roster in two years.

Several other incidents graced the sports pages
during the past few weeks. Eight University of Ken-
tucky football players were arrested and charged with
sexual offenses. And down in Morgantown, home
of the Mountaineers, one player has been convicted
and is currently doing time while several others have
been suspended from the team by Coach Frank
Cigneti, who, unlike another coach, has not been
afraid to lay down his toughness and treat players
accordingly, regardless of his value to the team.

 
 

Stu Swanson is one of eight Pitt swimmers in Cleveland.

  Tankers in Cleveland for NCAA’s

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News‘Staff Writer
Eight Panthers will compete in
the NCAA Swimming and Diving
Championship that begins tomor-
row at the Cleveland State
Natatorium. I
Representing Pitt will be Mark
Schuman, 100-yard butterfly and
200-yard individual medley; Stu
Swanson, 200-yard backstroke;
Mickey Termin, 100-yard freestyle;
Pat Greenwell, one and three-
meter diving; and Scott Winkler,
three-meter diving.
Meanwhile, Rick Carter, Bob
Greenwald, Schuman and Termin
will swim in the 400-yard freestyle
relay, while Mike Connor, Schu-
A man, Swanson and Termin team up
in the 400-yard medley relay.
“We hope we can swim our best
times because if we do, we’ll score
some points,” Panther coach Fred
Lewis ,said._ I ’
“It’s hard to say, however,

rwhether we will be nationally

ranked,” Lewis continued. “We’re

in that in-between time where we
rest and taper out, so it’s really
hard to say how we’ll do.”

Team scoring in the NCAA’s
determines national rankings.’

Pitt’s strongest events are
probably the 100-yard butterﬂy and
the 400-yard medley relay, al-

though Lewis, in his first year as

Panther head coach, expects good
showings by Schuman in the
200-yard individual medley and
Termin in the 100-yard freestyle.
“We aren’t seeded as well
individually as we were last season,
but we’re looking forward to doing
better as a team,” Lewis said.
Pitt didn’t score in last season’s
NCAA’s, held in California.
Defending champion Tennessee,

to battle for the team title. _

What Do Pitt’s Stetler and Tony Dorsett Have in Common?

By ANGELA VAVITHES
Pitt News Staff Writer

Swimmer Kathy Stetler proved
that men don’t have a monopoly on
athletic talent when she earned
All-America status before a home-
town crowd Thursday night.
Stetler is familiar with this honor,
in fact, she and Tony Dorsett are
the only Pitt sports stars who were
All-Americans four consecutive
years. Last year she was also Pitt’s
ﬁrst individual national champion
since 1960.

In Dorsett’,s case, the honors
made him a sure first round draft
pick, but Kathy has a lengthier
selection of opportunities.

Her plans include the Amateur
Athletic Union (AAU) National
Championships in a few weeks.

“From AAU nationals they pick
the top two or three for the Pan-Am
games and other foreign trips,”
said Kathy. “After that I don’t
know what I’m going to do.”

Professional swimming does
exist and is proﬁtable. “I don’t
want to become a professional
swimmer,” Kathy added. “I don’t
want the pressure of thinking I
have to finish second in order to

pay the rent. Individual sports just
aren’t like team sports. With
swimming you just work to perform
well, with the Olympics as the
ultimate goal. Even at the top you
try to go faster. I don’t think I’ve

peaked yet. I’m swimming my best

times ever.” -

Kathy, from nearby Oakmont,
started her long journey to the top
when she was only 8 years old in
her hometown country club. Like
thousands of children around the
country, she practiced swimming

every day in the summer. After a
few years, Kathy entered a New
Kensington YMCA program where
the competition was more varied.
As a high school senior, Kathy
joined Pitt swimming coach Dick
Bradshaw’s AAU team. The team

Kathy Stetler (center lane) achieved All-America status for four years.

Canevin Grad Lachowicz Makes  
His Pitch to Panther Coaches

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer
Allen Lachowicz has yet to pitch
for the Panthers, but already he’s
made Pitt baseball history.

The freshman from McKees
Rocks is the ﬁrst Pitt baseball
player to receive a full athletic
scholarship.

Pitt usually awards free tuition
and books to most of its baseball
players. Lackowicz, a pitching star
at Canevin High School, receives
both, plus room and board.

“At first, Pitt wanted to give me
just books and tuition, but I
wanted to live on campus,”
explained Lachowicz, who was also

Indiana.

recruited by Ohio State and
“I didn’t know if I could
get room and board until Coach
(Bob) Lewis called me the next day
and told me I could have it."

The extra investment should pay
off for the baseball team, hoping to

improve last season’s 11-17-1

record. Probably the best high
school pitcher in Western‘Pa. last
season, Lachowicz is expected to
start this season.

“Allen’s been very impressive in
practice,” said Lewis. “He has an
excellent attitude, is a 3.0 student
(industrial engineering), and over-
all, is just a fine young man. We’re
happy to have him."

Drafted by the New York Mets
last summer, Lachowicz" turned
down a shot at the pros to attend
Pitt.

“l still want to play pro ball, but I
think it’s important that I get my
education first,” the freshman
said.

Last season was Lachowicz’ best
by far. In leading Canevin to a
second consecutive Western Pa.
Interscholastic Athletic League
(WPIAL) playoff berth, the six-
foot-three, 182-pound pitcher won
11 and lost only one; averaged 13

ion (Kathy), Bradshaw’s club went
on to give Pitt a nationally ranked
distance swimmer, Dale Pﬂaumer,
and a high school champion, Jan
Udjevich. ' i

The demands of swimming leave
little time for a leisurely social life.

“I haven’t missed anything,”
said Kathy with a big smile.
“Swimming is so much a part of my
life that I don’t know if I’ve missed
anything. I get along well with
everyone on the team and I don’t
feel any pressure from an_yone but
myself.”

There is something Kathy
believes is wrong with amateur
swimming.

“The government should supply
funds——it’s ridiculous not to be-
cause swimming is so expensive.
In college they pay for transporta-
tion and hotels for meets but in
AAU, you have to pay for
everything. If you're good but

can’t afford it, you just can’t go to
meets, it’s not fair.

“Some people just don’t have
the opportunities, like the children,
to start when they’re still young.”

A team of Pitt students, playing a game
known as “Ultimate Frisbee,” placed second
out of four schools in a local college
tournament last weekend.

Pharmacy student Randy Strausser, captain
and organizer of the team, describes the game
as.“something like soccer.”

Seven-man teams play on a football field
setting 70-yards-long, ﬁfty-yards-wide, with
25-yard end zones. The idea is to whirl the
frisbee to one’s teammate and eventually
score by reaching a player in the end zone.

“It’s basically a non-contact sport,” said
Strausser. “An interception or dropped
attempt turns possession over to the other
team. Two 22-minute halves are played. 1

Pitt’s record was 1-1-1 in the round-robin
tournament, with a‘ win against Indiana
University _(Pa.) 11-9, loss to tournament
champion Carnegie-Mellon 4-10 and tie with
West Virginia University, 12-12. '

'CMU's team is co-ed, added Strausser, but
Pitt remains an all-male team. The tourna-
ment took place on the Tartan’s football field.

Strausser organized the team last term with
a few frisbee enthusiasts and now the squad is
comprised of 30 members. Frisbee is not an
NCAA-afﬁliated sport but the team does
belong to the Mid-Atlantic South Conference

of the International Frisbee Association.

sate; “We’re hoping to play the University of

Everyone has an excuse for not seeing their doctor
about colorectal cancer. However, every year 52,000 men

P I and women die of colorectal cancer in this country alone.

Two out of three of these people might be saved by early

detection and treatment. Two out of three.

So what is your excuse? Today you have a new,
simple, practical way of providing your doctor with astool
specimen on which he can perform the guaiac test. This can
detect signs of colorectal cancer in its early stages before
symptoms appear. While two out of three people can be
saved. Ask your doctor about a guaiac test, and stop

.excusing your life away.
