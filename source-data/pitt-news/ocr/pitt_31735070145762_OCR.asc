dorm expansion

University to fund construction and renovation

Gretchen Andersen
Staﬁ"Wri ter

l Pitt will add dormitory space to L0-

throp Hall and Bouquet Gardens, as
well as fund a renovation project in
the William Pitt Union. Some phases
of the expansion plans will be com-
pleted by 2011.-

The Property and Facilities Com-
mittee of the Board of Trustees ap-
proved $46 million for construction
and renovation projects Wednesday,
$15 million of which comes from
the stimulus package. The plan also
includes money for new laborato-
ries and building projects at Pitt’s
regional campuses. .

The housing expansion projects
are part of the University’s effort
to cater to a “strong” demand for
on-campus undergraduate student
housing, according_to the meet-
ing’s agenda. Pitt currently offers

. guaranteed housing to half of the_
. undergraduate population — stu-

dents are no longer guaranteed af-
ter their freshman and sophomore
years, University spokesman John
Fedele said.

He said the projects will not allow
for three years of guaranteed hous-
ing, but that they will “provide more
ﬂexibilities for transfer students 3?

The dormitory expansion proj-
ects will add 47 newbeds to Lothrop
Hal1’s first ﬂoor, which used to house
ofﬁce space for UPMC. This space
will be transformed into additional
undergraduate housing consistent
with the style of the other dorms.

Lothrop Hall now houses 676

A students. According to the agenda,

the project also includes expansion

 

for Lothrop Hall, Bouquet Gardens and Union

of existing bathrooms to “accommo-
date shower facilities, new ﬁnishes
and ﬁxtures,” as well as a new study
lounge, wireless internet access and
“improved security.”

Pitt will use the property at 315
Oakland Ave. for the Bouquet Gar-
dens expansion. Currently, those
residences house 496 students, and
the project will increase capacity
by 150 to 200 by August 2011, the
expected.occupancy date.

The University also plans to con-
struct a new dorm that will be nine
to Histories and will create 500 new
beds, Executive Vice Chancellor]e-
rome Cochran said.

“We are still in a design stage,”
Cochran said. “There is no project
start date, but the location will be
below the University Club, across
Fifth Avenue from Towers.”

The Lothrop Hall expansion
will cost $1.56 million, whereas the
Bouquet Gardens project will cost
$2.8 million. The money for those
projects will come from auxillary

reserves and auxillary debt, parts a

of the budget generally reserved for
housing and food services.

The funds approved for the
Union project will be used to reno-
vate the ninth floor. According to
the agenda, the plans include a new
student study area and lounge, of-
ﬁces for Residence Life, Pitt Arts and
a chaplain, a 20-person conference
room, a kitchen and storage areas.
New energy-efﬁcient lighting will be
installed, and the heating, ventilat-
ing and air conditioning systems will
be upgraded. ‘

The changes will last until the end

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said he
did notknowwhatwould happen after

schedule in the summer, anyway.

He said he didn’tthinkthe changes

money. .

Career Fair to feature more employers

After rescheduling its dates because of the February snowstorm, Pitt ’s Career Fair will host 129 companies next week. -

Eric Shannon
Sta_[fWrite1"”

Despite the rescheduled date,
more employers will attend the
University’s Career Fair next week
than were scheduled to attend it
on its original date. '

The fair was originally sched-
uled for Feb. 10 and 11, but the
Office of Student Employment and
Placement Assistance changed the
dates to Monday and Tuesday af-
ter a historic snowstorm stopped
the city’s operations for several
days. ' o

Monday’s fair will host techni-
cal employers, while Tuesday’s
will host non-technical ones. It
will run from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
both days in the William Pitt
Union and is free for all Pitt stu-
dents and alumni.

Employers seemed to adjust
quickly to‘ the schedule change
—— nine employers pulled out of
the fair, but 13 more signed up. Ac-
cording to the SEPA website, 129
employers will attend the fair.

But rescheduling presented
problems for some students.

Kumiko Tomazawa, an ac-
counting major, was prepared for
the ﬁrst date. ‘

“The problem is this week and
next week isvmidterms for me,
and it’s right before spring break,”
Tomazawa said.

' Other students, such as infor-
mation sciences student Lauren

Mazzotta, "found that the new.

dates are more convenient. ~

“It’s easier for me because I
wasn’t prepared the ﬁrst ti'me,”_
Mazzotta said. “I’m just glad they

.didn’t. try to have it when it was

snowing.” »
Monica Varela, special events
and marketing coordinator for the
fair, said SEPA considered several
factors when choosing the new
dates.’ The ofﬁce’s workers con-
sidered whether the William Pitt
Union were open for space and the
fact that many employers need-
ed to complete their candidate
searches before spring break.
Varela saidit’s hard to tell if
the rescheduling translates to

  greatcare just
got faster.

more or less jobs offered because
each employer offers different po-
'sitions. '

The nine employers who can-
celed include Wal-Mart Stores,
Grant Street Group, Raytheon
Company, Macy’s, Philadelphia

they will remain visible on cam-
pus conducting on-campus infor-
mation sessions throughout the
semester,” she said.

V This disparity in employers at
the fair could be problematic for
some students who were inter-

 

' The fact that it’s closer to graduation is a
good thing. I think more employers are
looking for people right now.

Tianna Hedges

Teaching Fellows, Kurt J. Lesker
Company, American Contracting
and Environmental Services, Fer-
guson Enterprises and U.S. Gen-
eral Services Administration.
Varela said many companies
are still interested in Pitt stu-
dents.
: “Many have assured us that

ested in speciﬁc companies.

“I was interested in Grant
Street-Group, but I understand
that they had to cance ,’i said Ti-
anna Hedges, a computer science
major.

I She remained optimistic about
opportunities at the fair and said
she planned to attend both days,

even though the second day will
be for non—technical companies.

“The fact that it’s closer to
graduation is a good thing. I think
more employers are looking for
people now,” she said.

Civil engineering major E.].
Regula said he wasn’t sure if the
fair were right for him.

“I was going to go to the ﬁrst
one [in February], but after it got
canceled, I went out on my own
and did research and found a lot of
things,” Regula said. “I probably
won’t even be able to go anyway,
because of class.”

Cheryl Finlay, director of the
Office of Student Employment and
Placement Assistance, said she
hopes students will use the fair
to ﬁnd not only jobs but intern-
ships as well.

Because of the lack of time
for planning before the resched-
uled events, there‘ will not be any
“career kickoff” events. But the
Career Development Oﬂice has
been reviewing resumes during
walk-in hours and is still prepar-
ing students for the fair.

SOME IJNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM

No job lined up? Rock out

Taking a risk after graduation could be your only chance to pursue dreams. I

Jacob Brown
' Columnist

   

If ever there were asocial barometer
foryoungpeople inthe United States,
it would be rock ‘n’ roll. '
As the music of youthful rebellion,
rockhas served to carry meaningful
messages to different generations
of listeners. But the messages over
the last 20 years have served as little

more than a platform for confusion

and failure.

During the early and mid-1990s,
the grunge era told people our age
that it was OK to become social re-
cluses, to hate life and everything it
entailed.

For all of its fallacies, grunge at
least had a direction. Following it, we

hadasloppymixofmainstream punk _

— mostly about parent-hating and
drug use —- and some pop—rock. Al-

‘ though there were some standouts in

the 1990s, most of it was rubbish.
Into the 2000s, rock has further

morphed into a convoluted mess that

doesn’t relate to its audience. Ifnoth-

ing else could demonstrate just how
bad it’s gotten, N ickelback had the
top—selling rock album of 2009. _

Back when ' singers actually
brushed their teeth with a bottle of

Jack instead of simplytalkingabout it
for shock value, the music was great.
Instead of consistingpurely ofwhiny,
irritable impertinence, rock used to
tell America’s youth to aspire to be
somebody. ‘

Rock inthe 1970s and 198oswas
about havingagood time andtaking
whatever you could ﬁt into a suitcase
with you on your exodus to Los Ange-
les or New York. It was about living
foryour dream, takingachance and
hopeﬁilly making it big.

p I’ve thought about this for the
better part of this week. As you read
this, I am in New York preparing for
what I’m hopingwill be the ﬁrst step
of the rest of my life, professionally
speaking. .-

Instead of skin-tight, leopard-
print spandex, I’m wearing a suit.
Instead of a guitar, I’m wielding a
briefcase with my portfolio and a
few copies of my resume in it.

Make no doubt about it, I’m shoot- _
ing for my chance to become a rock
— star, too. Chances are that by now,

to throw my MP3 player out of my car.

she wanted to be a professional mu-
sic video dance choreographer. She
was thinking about moving out to
California on awhim to see what she
could do. But I don’t think she ever
got past the planning stages.

In mentioning this, I’m not advo-
cating dropping out of college and
chasing something that isn’t there.
But you’re only young once, and do-

today’s job market, but it could be
your only opportunity.

Over the past four years in col-
lege, I_’ve learned much more outside
of the classroom than I have inside of
it. But if ever there were a class that
taught me something useful, it would
be ﬁnance. “The greater the risk, the
greater the reward,” my professor
said almost daily. It’s a shame I got a

’ C in that class.

My professor’s point also stands.

outside of the realm of discounted
cash ﬂows and interest rates. Recent
college grads sometimes come out
with a sense of entitlement that a
diploma that cost ﬁve or six ﬁgures
ought to land them awell paying job
immediately. Let’s face it, that’s not
usually the case.

Last July, Trina Thompson, a
graduate of Monroe College in the
Bronx, sued her alma mater for
$72,000 because she couldn’t ﬁnd

a job, CNN reported. Her story reads
like the lyrics of a Good Charlotte
song. ’

Her graduating GPA was a 2.7,
and I haven’t found mention of any
activities outside of the classroom
she participated in to make herself
more marketable. It takes more work

just going through the motions to get
anywhere, though. '

Reﬂecting back on elementary
school days, we all wanted to be as-

tronauts, paleontologists and, yes,
even rock stars. But getting older
has made our generation reprioritize
life, as it does with every generation.
Askworkingprofessionals whatthey
wanted to do when they were young.
Chances are it wasn’t what they’re
doing now. A

Inevitably, “dream” jobs are
coined as such because few people
ever get past dreaming about them.
Often, they take more luck to getthan

anything else. Gene Simmons was a
school teacher before meeting the
members of what became KISS. But
he seized his opportunity when it
arose, giving up the security of his
day job.

Similarly, I have no idea iftakinga
400-mile trip to New Yorkis asmart
idea, but I’m about to ﬁnd out. Let’s
rock and roll.

MOVIE REVIEW

Warner Bros. ﬂick anything but a ‘Cop Out’ I

‘Cop Out, ’ featuring Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan, offers authentic action and comedy.

Noah Levinson
Staffwri ter
“Cop Out” ,
Starring: Bruce Willis and Tracy
Morgan
Dir: Kevin Smith
Warner Bros.
Grade: B+

“Cop Out” starts with a beautiful
shot of New York but sheepishly pans
over to the grittier Brooklyn, all to the
sweet melodies of the Beastie Boys’
“No Sleep Till Brooklyn.”

It made me realize that all of these
fancy cop movies take place in New
York, and rarely do ﬁlms make crum-
my Brooklyn their setting.

But that’s what Kevin Smith likes
to do — take the underappreciated
and give it some appreciation.

He made Leonardo, N.]., the home
ofjay and Silent Bob in “Clerks” and
“Clerks 2.” He even made Monro-

eville, Pa., the site of “Zack and Miri

Make a Porno.”

Half of the reason Smith uses
these places is to make fun of the
small—town feel and hopelessness
of it all, but it also shows a more true
depiction of the United States.

“Cop Out” follows the two New

York City Police Department oﬂicers
(Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan) as
they try to retrieve a stolen vintage
baseball card from some drug-deal-
ing d*cks in Brooklyn. .

Willis’ character needs to pawn
the card to pay for his daughter’s
wedding. If he doesn’t, her new step-
father (jason Lee, “My Name Is Earl”)
will grudgingly cover the expenses —
and will not let Willis forget it. -

Willis and Morgan work well to-
gether in “Cop Out” because they
play off each other with every op-
portunity they get — half of the ﬁlm
contains their banter about random
things. A

Each actor has his own persona,
which a ﬁlmmaker gets to manipu-
late. -

Take Willis, give him an estranged I

wife, a skyscraper in Los Angeles,
Austrian terrorists and a “Yippee-ki-
yay” catchphrase, and bam — “Die
Hard.”

It’s the same for Morgan. Give
him Goregasm, and you have “The
Legend of Dong Slayer.” Give him
Liz Lemon, and you have “:30 Rock”
on NBC. '

But in “Cop Out,” both seem so
stripped down that they only need to
bring themselves to the ﬁlm.

It also helps that Seann William
Scott, who has mostly had voice roles
lately (“The Promotion,” “Mr. Wood-
cock” and “Role Models”) brings his
ﬁinniest work to “Cop Out.”

Scott plays a parkour—addicted
burglar who gets caught by the of-
ﬁcers. ~

One of the most hilarious scenes
of the new decade by far occurs when
Willis and Morgan drive Scott’s char-
acter around intheir undercover cop
car.

Kevin Pollak and Adam Brody are

ANALYSIS

ligar Lindsay,

Kieran Layton
A&E Editor

 

Dear Lindsay Lohan,

1 read your interview with British
tabloid The Sun, and I must admit,
I’m impressed. You ﬁnally came clean
about your cocaine and alcohol abuse
(among other things), and you really
seem like you want to turn your life
and your career around.

But wait, shhh, what's that wheez-
ing sound? Oh yeah, it’s your career
struggling to catch one last dying
breath before ﬁzzling out completely.

In your case, Lindsay, I think this
interview mightbethe epitome of“too
litﬂe, too late.” You have pretty much
become irrelevantto everyone except

those who still seek to turn a proﬁt
from your once-celebrity — namely,
your father Michael Lohan. Even your
motherDina, , has started showingup
at events without you.

Your father, however, is still pub-
licly ranting about your safety, striving
togethis name on, attheveryleast,
the most obscure of gossip blogs. You
have publicly denouncedhimasarela—
tive, but hey, he deﬁnitely gets an A
for effort.

A tell-all exposé with The Sun
should have been a limelight-hogging
exerciseinfamewh*ring, butyou barely
made a splash this week in the celeb-
rity gossip roundup. Sure, you gotyour
name back on Perez Hilton’s website,
buthaveyoureallyheardanyonetalk

ght your dad at home

aboutanyoneother'thanTigerWoods -

recently? I didn’t think so.

Of course, the sad demise of your
status asa “serious actress” was in-
evitable.As ifyourhard-partyingways
and public dispute with your father
weren’t enoughto kil1yourcareer,your
general lack of quality project involve-

“—

‘Georgia Rules’

— what, exactly?
Certainly not the
box oﬂice. "

ment might be the nail in the coffin.
“GeorgiaRules” ——what, exactly? Cer-
tainly nottheboxoﬁice. “I Know Who
Killed Me” —Iknowwhatkilledyour
career! I- could go on all day.

If you want to salvage any piece‘

of your acting career, there are a few
things you need to do. First, stop ﬁght-
ingwithyour dad— in public. You two
have alot oﬁssues to work out, butthey
are issues that shouldbe discussedbe—
hind closed doors, not over Twitter.

Next, pick your projects careﬁilly.
No, yourﬁrsttopless nude scene in the
upcoming “Machete” doesn’t count. I
rememberatimewhen critics consid-
ered you a great talent. Find your next
“Mean Girls” and runwith it.

Finally, get your personal life in

‘ order. Samantha Ronson might have

been a ﬁin detour from reality, but
the drama has derailed your life to
the pointwhere even straight-to-DVD
projects wouldbeconsidered excellent
opporttmities. .

Now, I’m going to go watch “The
Parent Trap” for the 300th time, and
reminisceaboutthe pre-partyingdays
when you still had a beautiﬁil career"
ahead of you.

And when you were still a ginger.
Takecare, ’ *

Kieran Layton (and the rest of the
world) '

P.S. Just to clarify, “Dancing With
the Stars” would be taking two giant
tango steps backwards. You shouldrft
be that desperate.

Roboto gears down

The Mr. Roboto Project will close its doors — for now.

1 _ Eric Shannon
Staff‘ Writer

Proliﬁc Pittsburgh rock venue, The Mr.
Roboto Project, will close after 10‘years
in anticipation of moving to a new loca-
tion. ' ' .
Located just outside of the city limits in
a repurposed storefront, The Mr. Roboto
Project can barely hold 100 people.

A Yet some of the most notable bands of
the past decade, including Against Mel,
Bright Eyes, Death Cab for Cutie, Ted
Leo, Q and Not U and The Weakerthans,
have played at Roboto on their ascent
to fame.  T ‘ if P.

But the true heart of Robotolies in its
service to local Pittsburgh bands.

The creators modeled The Mr. Ro—
boto Project on the idea that anyone can
be a member, anyone can book his own
show and anyone can attend the shows
— meaning that no drugs, smoking or
alcohol are permitted.

“Ten years ago, there was nowhere in

4 the city for smaller sized bands to play,”

Brian Gruetze,-a member of Roboto, said.
“People got and essentially pooled money

   5-7,12-14

'%AYAiﬂSATlBBAY8PM
SIRDAHPM

and looked for spaces to open. Just on
people’s good will, good effort and faith
this could work put in the time and energy
so bands can play.’’

Despite Roboto’s success, the city has
changed, and the members feel like its
time in Wilkinsburg, Pa, has ended and
have decided to stop runni'ng shows at
the current space after Sunday. .

They have now started looking for a
new location to reopen The Mr. Roboto
Project, but there is no concrete plan
yet. 

For now, everybody prepares to close
the venue with a series of farewell shows
this weekend.

Early premier at Madison Square Garden

Just weeks away from the Big East Tournament, Pitt travelsto New York to play. St. John’s tomorrow.

Kyle Craig
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team’s trip
to Madison Square Garden on Satur-
day could greatly affect its chances

at the same historic venue in two

weeks.

Tomorrow at noon, the Panthers
travel to New York to play St. John’s
(15-12, 5-10) in their last road contest

 ofthe regular season.

At the beginning of the week, No.
12 Pitt (21-7, 10-5 Big East) was eyeing
a prospective Big East regular—season

Big East standings. Three of Pitt’s
ﬁve conference losses have come
against teams with a losing record
in Big East play. The top eight teams
get ﬁrst-round byes in the 16-team
tournament.

A slip-up against the Red Storm
would drop Pitt into a logjam in the
middle of the Big East standings with
No. 13 Georgetown, Marquette and
Louisville -—, all three teams are 9-6
in the conference.

February 26, 2010 l The Pitt News I wWW.pittneWs.com

With Kennedy failing to excel,
junior Justin Burrell came off the
bench to score 14 points for the Red
Storm, a mark that ties his season
high. Another bench player, junior
guard Dwight Hardy, contributed 12
points in the ﬁrst matchup.

V Despite being absent from the
starting lineup, Hardy is the Red
Storm’s second leading scorer. He
averages 10.6 points per game and
has a 39.7 3-point percentage.

The Panthers need a better de-
fensive effort against St.John’s than
they turned in Wednesday night
against Notre Dame. The Irish shot
55.6 percent from beyond the arc
and converted half of their ﬁeld goal
attempts (22-44).

Meanwhile, the Pitt offense
sputtered — particularly Gilbert
Brown, who scored three points and
went 0-5 from behind the 3-point
stripe.

St. John’s is attempting to ﬁn-
ish a regular season with a winning
record for the ﬁrst time since the
2007-08 campaign. The last time the
Red Storm qualiﬁed for the NCAA
Tournament was 2002.

’ WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

Bearcats to host ﬂaky Panthers Saturday

 

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team
fell back into bad habits against
DePaul on Wednesday, four days

~.» after it played arguably its best

conference game against Seton

Hall. .

When the Panthers (14-12,
4-10) travel to Cincinnati (11-15,
4-10) for a 2 p.m. game Saturday,
they will look to return to the play
that helped them go on a three-
game winning streak before fall-
ing to DePaul.

When the Panthers played

Seton Hall on Feb. 20, they
committed, 14 total turnovers,
including just eight in the first
half, pulling away for a 78-57
victory.

It was Pitt’s largest margin
of victory in conference games"
this yea .

The low number of turnovers

was a win in itself, as the Panthers
average 17.8 miscues per game.
Versus DePaul, the Panthers
turned the ball over 20 times.
Pitt also started to show some
offensive balance against Seton
Hall, as five different players
reached double ﬁgures.
Taneisha Harrison led the way

one has to contribute. We’re a

players out on the court need to

Only five players scored for

‘the Panthers in the loss.

Harrison and Sims combined

. to shoot 14-27 from the field. The

rest of the team shot 6-33 and
combined the Panthers shot 33.3
percent from the ﬁeld.

In contrast, Pitt shot 51.6 per-
cent against Seton Hall, its high-
est in conference play.

Furthermore, the Panthers
jumped out ‘to a lead against

Seton Hall, a lead they sustained
for the victory. '
Against DePaul, the Panthers

‘ fell behind early and were unable

to recover. .

“When you have a lead, your
shot just goes a little-biteasier,
your defense looks a little bit bet-
ter and I think you can rebound a
little bit better,” Berenato said.

However, one statistic re-
mained steady for Pitt between
the two games. Cole pulled down
a career—high 22 rebounds against
Seton Hall and followed that per-
formance with 18 boards against
DePaul. . 3

“Chelsea [Cole] was a beast

today gettingthe double—double,” _

Berenato said after the Seton Hall
game. “We [the post] are real-
izing that we can jump and re-
bound, and that it’s fun.”

‘ In order to defeat Cincinnati,
Cole must continue her strong
rebounding. Also, it’s essential
that the Panthers return to a low-

er turnover total and balanced
scoring. If they can do that, it’s
unlikely that they will fall behind
early. ‘ . ' ,'
Cincinnati is an experienced
squad, with four upperclassmen
as its top scorers. Three of those
players average double ﬁgures.
Senior guard Kahla Roud-

ebush leads the team with 13.1 ’

points per game.

Junior Shareese Ulis and red-
shirt junior Michelle Jones add
11.6 and 10.2 points, respec-
tively. ' '

Jones also pulls down a team-
high 7.2 points per game. Jones
was redshirted in the 2007-08
season but returned last season
to bring power to the boards for
the Bearcats. J

In their last game, the Bearcats

fell 64-43 to West Virginia. Roud- ‘

ebush led the team with 15 points,
while Ulis added 12 points. No
other Cincinnati player reached
double ﬁgures._ '
