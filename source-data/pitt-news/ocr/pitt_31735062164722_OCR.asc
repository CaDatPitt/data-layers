A * Humphrey Midday

Speaker Thursday

Vice-President Hubert H. Humphrey will address the
University at the Stephen Foster Memorial at this Thurs-
,day’s Student Union Board Midday Series at /3:30 p.m.

Afternoon classes will be cancelled only at the discre-
tion of the individual instructor.

The Vice-P-resident’s appearance will be his second at
the University within seven months. He appeared as vice-
presidential candidate last “October at a rally sponsored by
the University’s Young Citizens for Johnson-Humphrey.

Humphrey, a pharmacist by
profession, began his political ca-
reer as mayor of Minneapolis in
1945. During his term he began

» his struggle for equal rights by
establishing the nation’s ﬁrst .

Municipal Fair Employment Prac-
tices Commission.
‘He ﬁrst achieved national at-

‘ 76 tention when, at the 1948 Demo-

cratic Convention in Philadel-
phia, he led a successful ﬁght for
a strong Civil Rights plank in
the platform.

Humphrey went on from two
terms as mayor to become the
ﬁrst Democrat that Minnesota
sent to the United States Senate.
His rise to power in the Senate
was a slow and hard process be-
cause of his close identiﬁcation

Hubert Humphrey
with the liberal wing of his par-
ty and his outspoken criticismof
Senate operations.

In 1961, he was elected ma-

jority whip of the Senate and

co-sponsored such proposals as
the Test Ban Treaty and the
Civil Rights Act of 1964. Presi-

dent Johnson, in commenting on

the passage of the Civil Rights
bill. said that without Hump-
hrey “it couldn’t have happened.”

Brothc1‘iIiAntoninus

By KAREN TOKAR
"Brother Antoninus, Do-

minican lay brother and

modern poet, addressing the
Midday audience, Wednes-
day, in the Student Union
Supper Room declared that
a poet cannot lie; “the truth
of the unconscious finds ut-
terance because there are
moments of travail when
man is impelled to search for
the trut .”

At times obscure and difficult
to comprehend, Brother Antonin-
us preached that man must over-
come the tyranny of the ego and
come to terms with the other
side of one’s self, the uncon-
scious, before he can be free.

Before reading from his book,

The Crooked Lines of God, Broth-
Antoninus paced the stage and
stared at the audience, his face
trembling with anguish. He said
later, “I came to encounter you,
to confront you, but it is so
painful.”

Later rat the coffee hour in the
Lower Lounge, Brother Antonin-
us said that the poet participates
in a mode of language that helps
a culture solve the problem of
aliznation which everyone exper-
iences.

“A poem breaks the dominance
of the ego; it clears things up
and lets man see and understand
what he has known all his life,"
he added.

Brother Antoninus felt that in
the struggle between masculinity
and femininity, ﬂesh and spirit,
man must bring the two anti-

(Continued from Page 1)

Plans for the national teach-
in originated at the Kennedy In-
ternational Airport meeting of
representatives I from universities
across the country, including Dr.
Colodny, as a member of the
University Committee on Prob-
lems of War and Peace.

Dr. Colodny maintains that the
“academic world is involved up
to its neck in government policy
as it is their own ﬂesh .and blood
who are running policy opera-
tions. We hope to ventillate all
alternatives thoroughly. at the
teach-in.”

“The Great Society can never
be reached. if a "policy of im-
perialism is adopted,” Dr. Colod-
ny declared.

    

Dean Cooley

Dr. Silbey noted that the teach-
in will serve two purposes, pro-
viding education and exterting
pressure on the government. “We
must ask ourselves two questions:
Does the bombing lead to the risk
of further escalation? -Does it

to? “The answer to the ﬁrst ques-
tion is ‘yes’ to the second ‘no.”’

Those speaking at the teach-
in do not share a single policy
on the war and hope to iron out
their differences.

The nation-wide teach-in, Saturday, to protest United States policy

    

 

7 in Vietnam is the next opportunity for display of student involvement at
; this University.

The interest in South Vietnam is achieving the same level of intens-
ity that Civil Rights has aroused. Forty campuses throughout the ‘nation

  have already conducted teach-ins on this subject, the purpose of which is
- I  both to inform students on what is happening in Vietnam and to act as a
 A pressure tool against Washington.

These teach-ins could degenerate into, a propaganda grist mill for

1 those opposing Vietnam policy. Although there might appear to be an

equal opportunity to present the case for our involvement, there really
isn't one. _ _
During the demonstrations in Washington over the weekend of

_ April 17 there were teach-ins held at various colleges throughout the na-

tion. In every case there was ample opportunity for members of the

A opposition to speak. Few did. Those who did express their views were

usually assailed quite bitterly by the opposing speakers, including faculty

l‘lieTeachi-ln—  Trap for the llnwaryii

McBundy, special assistant to the President. Judging from the previous
teach-ins, hepshould expect the worse. He will be up against some-of the
most literate and well informed people on this continent. McBundy is at
a disadvantage because he is privy to secrets which he cannot disclose.
Where he could probably answer his critics decisively, his knowledge pre-
vents him. This is not to say that the arguments he will put forth will
not be logical nor morally sound. They will be; it is Just that there are
no ready made solutions for Vietnam.

For this reason it is much easier to criticize severely and logically

than it is to defend. This places McBundy and all those in favor of our .

policy at a supreme disadvantage. These people will also find their opposi-
tion‘ both vocal and Well prepared. «

This teach-in is an excellent thing for students to attend. If they
feel it is morally right, they should ‘become involved and support it. But
they ought to only attend this teach-in with their eyes, ears, and minds
open. They should be aware that it is being staged by mostly anti-Vietnam
people and groups, therefore giving i_t a decidedly anti-Vietnam flavor.
For this reason, students should listen very carefully to the arguments

, and also from the audience. ,
This particular teach-in is featuring a confrontation with George

| LETTERS TO THE EDITOR | I

I Student Protests

O’Brien Column

I Editor, The Pitt News:

It's your own fault, Pvt.

‘ O’Brien.

Sorry, but I'm afraid I have
no sympathy for Jim O’Brien’s,
complaints (Pitt News, April 28
and May 3) concerning the life

i ” of an Army private, for he had

the opportunity to make a great-
er contribution to his country’s
defense, and perhaps a more
pleasant one, too, through the

” Reserve Oﬁ‘icer’s Training Corps

(ROTC) as offered here at Pitt.
Since the Army needs men with

4 skills that range from account-

ing to veterinary, and from there
to journalism, the -Army would
have been better able to use
O’Brien’s particular skills had he
been trained as an officer.

Unfortunately, O’Brien is part

of a segment of our population

who would rather “sit and wait."
Their reasons for not wanting to
serve vary;_but they belong to a
segment in which the Dollar Sign
is “in” and the old ideal of
service is “out.”

Pvt. O’Brien also’ stated that
the Army is “anti-intellectual,”
a charge which I feel is both un-
just and untrue. The enlisted
men in the Army can be likened
to the “blue collar” workers of
industry; they are largely as-
signed to tasks in which brawn,
not brain, counts. As the blue
collar workers of industry, some
of the enlisted men in the Army
have not graduated from high
school.

But, unlike most companies,

I ~p The Question of Service

the Army has a system of schools
in which those men who have
not ﬁnished high school can gain
a high school diploma. ‘Army edu-

cational programs go further,-

though. The 'Army encourages
those. men who have graduated
from college to continue working
for advanced degrees. Many times
the Arxmr helps ﬁnance or grants
leaves of absence for those who
desire to take advantage of this
opportunity.

I feel that every person owes ~

our government some form of di-
rect service. I do not say that
ROTC is the only ﬁeld through
which this service can be direct-
ed, for it is not. But I do feel
that those who have had the op-
portunity to take advantage of
this program and who would
rather sit back hoping that they
will not be called upon to serve
should not complain when they
are ﬁnally called upon.

Editor, '1‘he,Pitt News:

I read with interest and with
some degree of amazement your
editorial of May 3, titled “An
American Tragedy.” The “sad”
tale of one Pfc. O’Brien, a young
man with a talent for “cute”
writing, served up the making of
the editorial stew. Reading be-
tween the lines, I sense that
O’Brien wrote with his tongue
in his cheek and with his sights
set on what the reader wants to
hear. — _

The editorial’s lament about
-the valuable college talent being

longest.

wasted is perfectly valid. But
wherein lies the blame? Is‘ it in
the principles upon which this
country was founded? Is it in the
legislation enacted by our gov-
ernment? Is it in the minds of
our young men who in too many
instances deny their responsibil-
ity for safeguarding our Ameri-
can way of life?

“The American Tragedy” is to
be found in the individual’s dis-
avowal of his social and ‘moral
obligation as a citizen, a ten-
dency that is quite prevalent.
The college student by virtue of
his talent and education has an
opportunity to make a signiﬁcant
contribution in a leadership role,
but generally looks the other
way and seeks to beat the draft.
If he fails in this selﬁsh goal, he
has no one to blame but himself.

Our armed forces have tradi-
tionally looked to the university
students to provide the neces-
sary leadership, but today unfor-
tunately the sense of giving and
sacriﬁce is too often overpower-
ed by a strong force, self-interest
—a real tragedy in America.

_ '_I‘oda.y’_s two letters to the editor_ deal with the question of military
obligation. Since this area IS of great importance to so many students, it
should be made clear that these two letters do not say the last word on
the su-bJect. Here are a few brief comments on their contentions.

~ . To be sure, much of the populace “disavows its
social and moral obligations.” Granting this, though,
We n_eedn’t conclude what Lt. Col.,Hollis has, that
meeting obligations ipso facto involves .several years
in the army. It is doubtful whether the army is
either the best way or the only way of fulfilling a
person’s obligations.

THE PEACETIME army benefits its country
only symbolically, that is, as a show of strength.
The man who W1S'heS_ to Work toward the concrete

_ improvement of his nation should consider service
of other sorts: the Peace Corps, VISTA, teaching,

army provides a minimum of the opportunities for creative leadership
which Lt. Col. Hollis implies exist. In other Words, whereas Lt. Col. Hollis
says, “The college student by virtue of ' his talent and education has an
opportunity to make a significant contribution in a leadership role, but
generally looks the other Way and seeks to beat the draft,” the reasonable
move for many would be to replace the word “but” with “and therefore.”

The question arises also whether affirming the importance of an
army necessitates that one -believe in compulsory service. In fact, even the
Defense Department doesn't contend that all men should be in the army,
for its ordinarily defers married men and students.

Let us inquire further: are the ROTC boys all duty-motivated? If '

they are, then why are so few of them‘ concerned with other social and
political obligations? Surely it requires no perversion of values to believe
that he who tutors for HEP serves as well as he who drills on the Cathe-
dral lawn ' ‘

The issue, then, is notione of serving or not serving,--but rather of.

The "Pittsburgh Play-
house’s production of Mary,
Mary was not great, but it
is worth seeing. It can be
recommended as a witty mo-
ment at the theatre.

The plot of Mary, Mary
deals with the effects of the
planned meeting of Bob and
Mary McKellaway, portray-
ed by actor, director, play-
wright William Glennon and
Doris Hackney, respectively. Bob
and Mary are. brought together
for the ﬁrst time since they plan-
ned their divorce nine months
earlier. Bob _ Jones successfully
portrays Oscar Nelson, lawyer,
adviser and wit, who arranged

the meeting to cle.an up a

“slight” mistake in Bob’s income
tax.

Bob’s salary from the publish-
ing ﬁrm he headed was less than
the amount he spent-$6,000 less.
Not only does Bob have ﬁnancial
troubles, but he also has a com-
munication problem. No matter
what he says to his wife, -he re-
ceives a biting. retort. He also
must face up to his frivolous fu-
ture wife, Tiffany Richards, por-

\

 

  Mary, Mary

trayed by the beautiful Lynn
George. Tiffany is a health-con-
scious, non-smoking, apricot-eat-
ing, wealthy young lady; just the
opposite of Mary.

Despite her frivolous ways she
does have something in common
with Mary—insight and straight-
forwardness. She is intelligent
enough to know that Bob is still
in love with Mary. Included in
this is a middle-aged, handsome
actor, Dick Winston, portrayed by
John George, who wants to pub-
lish a book to save his dying
name.

Dick falls in love with Mary
and treats her like the lovely
woman she really is. He wants
her to go with him to New Or-
leans where he has to make a

personal appearance.

The Playhouse production,
thoughtnotvery original, did get
the plot across very well. The
show started off slowly. Cues

were not timed right, causing-

some of the most humerous lines
to be ruined. However, as the
action developed and the actors
warmed up, the timing improved.

William Glennor kept the show
on its toes. His transitions from
calm to panic to calm to panic
were successful. Glennon left

ment.

much to be desired at the begin-
ning of the third act in which
he supposedly had been up the
night before. He went on to an ex-
cellent portrayal of someone who
took sleeping pills instead of
vitamins.

Doris Hackney’s portrayal of
Mary ﬂuctuated throughout the
whole show. At times she kept
the timing up to par. During her
second scene with Dick, Doris
played a convincing “happy” on
champagne. The Last scene in
the show between Bob and Mary
lost its humor because of late
cues, but the rest of Miss Hack-
ney’s performance added to rather
than subtracted from the show.

Lowell Zacks’ set was beauti-

‘ful. It was, at the beginning of

the play, the only thing that gave
the play any realism. One felt
very much at home if he had
ever lived in a New York apart-

6 10-0 Streak

By TOM SACKS

The inevitable finally hap-
pened to the baseball team
yesterday, when Penn State
snapped» the mitters’ ten
game Winning streak with a
C 2-1 victory in the ﬁrst game
6f a doubleheader at State.
The Winning run for the Nit-
tany Lions was unearned in
_in‘. the bottom of the seventh
inning.
. The mitters bounced back in
 the second game to win 7-0 be-
»_ hind the pitching of Lee Brueck-
el. The team had extended its
unbeaten record to 10, beating
Westminster, 11-3, last Wednes-
_ day. The Slippery Rock double-
. ' header, which had been sched-
_i ‘tiled for Saturday, was canceled
V due to confusion over the playing
site.

 

 

- - In the ﬁrst game at Penn State,
A the mitters tied the score, 1-1, in
 ‘o the top of the seventh inning.
" Sophomore Phil Nasaralah sin-
gled and stole second base. Catch-
er Doug Chambers singled to
drive him home. '

V What followed in the bottom
H .-of‘ the seventh inning appeared
- . to observers as if the Panthers
had taken hints from State on
how to lose ball games. Penn
State, now 6-7-1, had committed
29 errors in its ﬁrst six games
,' this season.

 

 

 , With one out and men on ﬁrst
 and second, due to successive
C " errors by shortstop Steve Kienzl
and ﬁrst baseman Barry Wetzel,
coach Bobby Lewis replaced
starting Dave Blyshak with Don

; Stock. There was already .a one

C ball count on the batter facing

Stock. Stock became the team’s
 scapegoat by pitching seven
it,’ straight balls, walking across the
" winning run.

Blyshak was credited with the
loss after winning three straight
games. He gave up six hits in six
innings.

 

_ In the second game, the mitters
 V A erupted for ﬁve rims in the sixth
 inning, adding single tallies in

the third and seventh. The Nit-
_ b tany Lions contributed to the

nines scanty six hit production
with three errors and six walks.

Tom Beckett and Bill Bodle
 is were the key batters in the sixth,
. each hitting a two-run single. In

mum MAZUREK continued his consistent batting against Penn State

yesterday, but the mitters still lost. Dave Blyshak lost the ﬁrst game,
2-1, but Lee Brueckel won his fourth game this year, 7-0, in the

nightcap.
the second game, Fred Sauer

collected two hits and Chambers 

hit a home rim.

Brueckel picked up his fourth .

win without a loss, allowing ﬁve
hits and striking out six.

The baseball team, which is i

now eyeing a NCAA- bid, travels
to California State tomorrow.
They return Wednesday to -face
West Virginia in what will prob-
ably be the most crucial game of
the season. The Mountaineers
are perrenial leaders in the
Southern Athletic Conference.

They are led‘ by ace pitcher
John Radosevich. He has been

in ‘l'.he‘_‘i20p ﬁve of NCAA strike- .

out leaders for two years, and
currently has the top average in
the nation with 16.9 strikeouts
per nine inning game. He has a
7-1 record this year.

The golf team shot a’ combined
score of 602, ﬁnishing fourth at
the Indiana State Invitational
Golf Tournament last Wednes-
day. Penn State won the tourna-

host Indiana by one stroke with
West Virginia placing third.

Phil Fassett and Bill Baloh
both shot 83 for the team’s low

scores.

The golfers remain winless,
but Torn Connors, the Chartiers

Longshots led the field Saturday as the track team de-
feated Colgate, 76-66, giving them a season record of 3-3.

Sophomores were the key to the team’s Victory, Win-
ning four events and scoring 37 of the squad’s 76 points,
Coach Carl Rees got excellent performances from soPh0-
mores Paul Lambert, Frank Handleman, Dave Sallach, and
Dave Hangosky.

Lambert won the 120-yard hur-
dles and took second in the 440-
yard hurdle event, while Han-
dleman scored his ﬁrst points of
the season, winning the two-mile
I‘1.II1.

Hangosky had his best per-

gain a ten point advantage on
the tracksters. The two-milers led
by Handleman and Eichenlaub,
with John Bailey taking third,
made up the deﬁcit.

beating Ken Perry, 6-3 and
Dick Bloch, 6-1, 6-8, and 6-0, in
the second. He is 8-0 this season.

Bloch accounted for the ten-
nismen’s only match points in
the home contest. After losing
the ﬁrst set, 3-6, he came back to
defeat John Hefner, 6-2 and 6-1.
Bloch teamed with Marty Liebe-
witz in a doubles match for the
second match-point, downing
Dave Rankin and Tom Hanna,
6-3, 5-7, and 6-4.

Coach Ben Pope gave two fac-
tors for the shutout loss at Mor-
gantown. “They had that home
court advantage and, of course,
Perry had to go home and Dick
Belzer replaced him in the line-
up,” he said.

“Sam Donatelli put up a good
ﬁght against their number one
man (Eddie Ray), but lost twice
(8-6, 7-5, and 6-4, 7-5),” said
Pope. “Sam’s a steady player with
good form, but he comes up
against some top players in that
hot number one position.”

Donatelli’s singles record thus

on the sophomores to score some,
points for us and they did it

second to Lambert in the 120-
yard hurdle event.

In other events, Luddy Hay-

leapof 22 feet eight inches, but _
reinjured his leg and could not
run up to par in his other events.
Mort Stanﬁeld won the pole vault
and ﬁnished third in the javelin
throw.

against Colgate. With (Luddy)
Hayden not up to full strength,
Lambert and Poellnitz must score
as they did. I also think Sallach

Jim LaValley, another sopho-

second week in a row. His height
was six feel; one inch. Distance
runner Dave Eichenlaub ﬁnished
second to Handleman in the two- ~

In the featured races of the

Colgate swept both the 440-

and shaving.

  

Crazy diet, ridiculous hours

Your skin doesn’t stand much of
a chance against them.

Pay a bit more and
get the cordless ’

REMINGTON” LEKTRONIC II.
The diet and the hours you

can’t do much about.

 

The LEKTRONIC II puts a different
complexion on shaving.

4 tiny rollers on top of the big shaver
head protect like bumpers. Make sure
you get in close, but not too close
for comfort.

Once you're there, 348 cutting edges
take over. They're honed from surgical
high-carbon steel, so things never get dull.

Behind the scenes. there's the most
powerful motor in electric shaving. Works
on rechargeable energy cells without a
card (_also works with a cord, if‘ you
forget to recharge). Frees you to shave
when you want. Where you want. And
there's no slowdown around tricky
neck or chin areas.

Get yourself the cordless REMINGTON
LEKTRONIC II Shaver. lt’ll give your
skin a fighting chance.
