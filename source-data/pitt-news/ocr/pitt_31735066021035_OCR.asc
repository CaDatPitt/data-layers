Representatives of the Pittsburgh Police, North and South Oakland citizens’ organizations
to "comb" out differences they had with fraternity party noise.

By Scot Ross

9 News Editor

After 15 years of disputes over
fraternity party noise in North
Oakland, an agreement was
made on Friday designed to pre-
vent conflicts between the Pitt
fraternities and the Oakland
residents.

The agreement was instituted
under the auspices of the Inter-
fraternity Council, the Panhe|Ien—
ic Association, the North
Bellefield Area Citizens Associa-
tion, the South Oakland Citizens

Q Council Inc. and.‘ Officer David

McNutt of the Zone 6 Pittsburgh
Police.

Negotiations were handled by A

the Pittsburgh Mediation Center
for over a year before a settlement
was reached.

Helen Schlenke, president of
the Bellefield association, said
that the terms of the agreement
lead her to believe that this will
be a successful venture.

”If they are going to cut down
the noise, and clean up, then the
problem won't be there,”
Schlenke said. ’’I must say, in the
last couple months, they have
tried to comply. There has been

a significant improvement.

”You had those fraternities, and
all those people and no regula-
tions. It was really bad,”
Schlenke said.

IFC President Jim Venturella
was unavailable for comment.

Under the terms of the accord,
a ”task force” comprised of the

groups that signed the agreement ~

will meet on a regular basis to
discuss troubles and grievances.
Of the individual groups, the
responsibilities are as follows:

With the 110th anniversary
of the Pittsburgh National
Guard under way, some stu-
dents are still unaware that a
commitment of one weekend
a month with the Guard can
help to earn money toward the
costs of higher education.

Being honored is the 28th
Infantry Division, which is the
nation's oldest division, dating
back to 1879.

The celebration, named
Operation Muster-89, has
been formulated in order to in-
form people about the actions
of the Guard.

”We primarily wish to get

Guard celebrates 1 10 years

the word out on what we do,"
said Sgt. Jim Fike. ”It’s more of
an information type of thing
than anything else.”

National Guard activities in-
clude such things as serving
local communities during
emergencies like floods and
tornadoes.

What most people are not
aware of is the fact that the
Guard is not a full—time mili-
tary commitment. .

Members are referred to as
”citizen soldiers,” spending
approximately two days per
month being trained.

This is the biggest reason
why the Guard could prove
beneficial to college students.

”We don't get many
recruits,” said Fike. ”Most

think they need to prove more
of a commitment.”

As a result of a new GI Bill,
working for the Guard one
weekend a month will earn a
student $110, with an addi-
tional $140 gjven toward edu-
cation costs, bringing $240
directly to the student each
month.

Also, the National Guard
employs a program where it
will repay student loans of up
to $20,000.

Fike said,‘ ”There are not
many freshmen involved be-
cause it usually takes students
about a year before they real-
ize how much money they

to establish a ”house monitoring”

system that will check guests in"

and out, control noise, assure
clean up by 10 a.m. and a desig-
nated person to answer com-
plaints over the phone.

0 The IFC will oversee the
agreement and decide on judicial
infractions within its jurisdiction
against any houses, as well as
educate the houses about penal-
ties they could be subject to in
the event of violations.

0 Panhel will educate its mem-
bers and offer support for the
agreement.

0 Community representatives
will work to create better rela-
tions between themselves and the
fraternities. In addition, they will
encourage the public to deal with
individual fraternities about com-
plaints, rather than just call the
police.

0 The Zone 6 police will pro-
vide the IFC with complaints
received and ask the public to
contact the fraternity houses with
grievances that can be resolved
without the aid of police as-
sistance. ’

Activist Davis pleads
for basic human rights

By Marc Hopkins
Staff Writer

The struggle for human rights
was the focus of Angela Davis’
address last Friday evening in the
William Pitt Union.

Davis, author and activist, who
was twice run as the Communist
Party, U.S.A.’s vice presidential
candidate, appeared before the
capacity crowd as part of a ser-
ies of events sponsoredby the
Black Action Society in honor of
Black History Month,

Davis reminded the audience of
the progress made in the instruc-
tion of Afro—American history,
noting that it originally lasted

only one week.

”Now one month, it is ironical-
ly the shortest month,” said Da-
vis. ”Afro-American history

should be learned 365 days a V

year.”

Davis also offered her views on
the political system. ”For the past
eight years a professional actor

has been at the helm of the

government,” said Davis.

The Reagan administration
”has created the illusion that ra-
cism no longer really exists,” said
Davis.

She said Reagan believes that
if racially inspired violence oc-
curs, it is only a prank, and that

Tower pledges not to drink alcohol if confirmed

WASHINGTON (AP) —
Defense Secretary—designate John
Tower said Sunday that he is not
an alcoholic and issued an ex-
traordinary pledge not to take a
single drink if he is confirmed by
the Senate to head the Pentagon.

As Tower defended his reputa-
tion in nationally televised inter-
views, Senate Armed Services
Committee chairman Sam Nunn,
D—Ga., accused the White House
of leaking information from the
FBI report on Tower and threa-
tened to reopen the hearings on
the nomination and subpoena
anonymous witnesses quoted in
the agency review.

The committee voted 11-9
along party lines last Thursday to
recommend that the full Senate
reject Tower's nomination, with
Nunn citing allegations of exces-
sive drinking by the nominee.

In his first interview since the
vote, Tower denied that he was
an alcoholic, and with his un-
usual promise sought to allay
fears among his former col-
leagues and remove the obstacles
to his confirmation.

-------------- . . . . . . ---------------

SUMMER LANGUAGE PROGRAMS

The full Senate is expected to
take up the nomination on Wed-
nesday.

”| hearby swear and undertake
that if confirmed, during the
course of my tenure as Secretary
of Defense, I will not consume
beverage alcohol of any type or
form, including wine, beer or
spirits of any kind,” Tower said.

Tower also vowed that if he
broke his pledge not to drink, he
would step down. .

’’Twelve years ago, I gave up
spirits,” he said. ”I used to be a
pretty good scotch drinker. I ha-
ven't tasted scotch in 12 years.
After that I had only wine, and
perhaps an occasional martini,
occasionally a little vodka with
smoked salmon, caviar, some-
thing like that. That was just oc-
casiona|ly.”

Tracking the perfect

panacea for research

In 1986, Dr. Howard Cantekin started a controver-
sial public debate with Pitt about the objectivity of a
study done on a drug called amoxicillin. He charged
that because the companies that make the drug have
donated large sums of money to the university's
otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat) department, the

results of the study, which recommend the use of the —

drug, are not necessarily valid.

Welcome to the real world, Dr. Cantekin.

It has often been said that there is no such thing as
a free lunch, and there is certainly no such thing as a
free research project. One way or another, every study
finds funding, whether it be from the government or
from private industry or individuals. Everything must
be paid for, and therefore, potentially everything, in-
cluding results, can be bought and sold.

The thing is, doctor, that if all results were bought,
a substantially different attitude regarding the nation's
use and abuse of chemicals would exist. If it were as

oeasy as funding research, then we would be ableto buy

our cigarettes in packages white and pristine, free of
any ugly surgeon general’s warnings. After all, the tobac-
co industry has been one of the richest and most in-
fluential groups of research sponsors in American
history. And they have had an effect on tobacco—related
research. It is just that, for the most part, research is car-
ried out with two important factors, which keep it rela-
tively honest.

The first factor is the concept of the double-blind test.

0 To ensure fairly objective results, half the patients in

most studies are given a placebo — that is, a pill that
produces no discernible effect — and the other half are
given a regular dose of the medication being tested. The
doctors evaluating the patients are not the same doc-
tors who administer, unknowingly, either a placebo or

' the drug. lfthey just say ”Yes, it works,” they run'a risk

of confirming the placebo, which means that the drug
is about as effective as sugarin treating ailments.

The second factor is even more simple. Perhaps some
people are inherently honest. If that is too much to ask,
then the question of whether or not a company wants
to become liable for distributing a harmful substance
"as a medicine should be raised.

Whatever the case with amoxicillin, there is one basic
conclusion which is necessary for the progress of phar-
maceutics through research — eventually, we have to
trust the results. .

l\ew pistols overdue

"The city of Pittsburgh has announced a breakthrough.
The Pittsburgh police SWAT team IS now going to be

-3 equipped with semi-automatic weapons. _
SWAT stands for ”spectal‘ weapons and tactics.” The '

handgun previously issued for the team was a Smith
and Wesson .38 special pistol. A six-shot revolver —
hardly a ”special weapon.” Narcotics officers carry a
“Sig-Sauer P—220, which is a 9mm semi-automatic. It is
easily loaded using a clip, can be fired 15 times before
reloading, and shots can be fired in quick succession.
This is one of the weapons being discussed as a possi-
bility for the SWAT team. V A ,
It is about time. It is ludicrous.that policemen in a
divisiondesigned for the utilization of special weaponry
should be carrying a dinosaur for a gun.

 

   



American history desegregation

As February draws to a close,
another Black History Month
comes to an end. George
Washington Carver, Harriet Tub-
man, Marion Anderson and other
memorable figures of the past
will be put back into the files till
next February comes around; in
our nation's schools, the pictures
of Dr. King and Louis Armstrong
will be removed. Many people in
academia, both black and white,
view Black History Month as a
positive means for enlightening
people as to the achievements of
black Americans.

But I would like to suggest that

Black History Month as an educa-
tional medium is only a sem-
blance of the racial apartheid that
existed in the United States 20
years ago. Black Americans have
had to endure separate bath-
rooms, separate water fountains,
separate educational facilities —
and the last relic of this kind of
thinking is the continued support
of Black History Month. Let the
words sink in: BLACK HISTORY
MONTH. Segregation is still
segregation, no matter ho_w

The inspiration for a generations

Of course everyone has
watched Scooby Doo, consider-
ing that it has been on, in one
form or another since 1970.
Whether it was Scooby Doo,

‘ Where Are You? or Scoobj/'s All-

Star Laff—a-Lympics or any of the
other incarnations, it was always
basically the same. In later years,
Fred, Daphne and the Mystery
Machine were ditched, but Scoo-
by always had one loyal friend —
Shaggy. ‘ v I

LOU GRIECO

In the 1950s, most television
characters were conformists. Af-
ter the upheavals of Vietnam, a
new breed had emerged — the
antihero. Shaggy was a social
misfit. Fred always sent him with
the dog, where they would in-
evitably become embroiled in
some snafu.

If Dustin Hoffman could be the
”normal Joe" in The Graduate,
Shaggy filled a similar role for a
society not sure of itself.

‘Fred was the winnerin the ser-
ies. Daphne would never have

considereddating Shaggy. Even _ Pussycats I

  

celebrated or accepted.

History is a sequence of events
that affects people irrespective of
color or ethnicity. So the question
has to be asked — why isn't his-

tory taught in the context in
which it occurs? During ll
months of the year, children are
taught that Thomas Edison in-
vented the light bulb, but they
have to wait for February to learn
that a black American, Louis
Latimer, created the filament
which enables the bulb to glow.
Or that Charles Drew was the first

surgeon to perform open—heart
surgery.

The time for the desegregation
of history is long overdue, not
only for the purpose of teaching
America's history in the order in

- which it occurred, but also for the

psychological message it sends to
young people everywhere —— that
the history of the Afro—American
is so insignificant and inconse-
quential that it has to be taught
within the confines of 28 days,

Velma preferred being with Fred
and Daphne.

But he didn't care.‘Shaggy re-
jected them, as he did the rest of

the hypocritical society that op-_

pressed him. His appearance was
unkempt, and he truly represent-
ed the "beatnik” lifestyle. Ever
wonder why he always had the
munchies? '

Shaggy's dependence on
”Scooby_Snax” mirrored a gener-
ation of young people expanding
their minds, without explicitly ad-
dressing the issue of drugs on a
Saturday morning cartoon.

As a young man searching for
an identity, the character of Shag-
gy was versatile enough to fit into
a plethora of situations, and so he
found his way into other, more
upwardly mobile cartoons.

Alexander, from /osie and the
Pussycats is a prime example. In
the cool, hip world of rock mus-
ic, he could find a niche where
he could be productive and
useful.

His usefulness didn't fade
when they made the jump to out-
er space; His resourceful nature

,' proved invaluable in getting the

There are still those in the 1 
world of academia who insist that

or even in the next five years. In

response to this, Dr. King said:

Davis urged the audience to
guard against the barriers to
progress, citing the conservative
decisions of the Reagan Supreme
Court and the election of ex-
Crand Wizard of the Ku Klux
Klan, David Duke, to the Loui-
siana State Legislature as ex-
amples.

”Racism is a serious problem in
the 1980s; over the last eight
years, racist violence has erupted,
which frightens those who lived
in the '50s and '60s,” said Davis.

Davis explained that racism es-
tablishes the foundation for the
rise in anti—s'emitism, anti-
feminism and the discrimination
against gays and lesbians.

 

The struggle for human rights,
Davis said, has enjoyed some vic-
tories in the last eight years of the
Reagan era, among them the
large attendance of the 25th an-
niversary of Dr. King's March on
\/Vasiiington, the rejection of
Robert Bork and the presidential
campaign of Jesse Jackson.

6Celtics starting over with younger players

Even before the National
Basketball League season began,
the Boston Celtics knew they
were in trouble.

Four starters — Dennis John-
son, Larry Bird, Robert Parish and
Kevin McHale — were at least 30
years old, and the fifth, Danny
Ainge, was 29.

Fifty-four games into the sea-
son, age is not a problem. Rather,
lack of it is. .

Perennial All—Star Bird played
only six games before undergo-
ing surgery on bone spurs on
both of his ankles. Ainge was
traded to the Sacramento Kings
last week for former first-round
draft picks Joe Kleine and Ed
Pinckney. '

And a bench that used to go
none-deep is now stocked with
players some may never have
heard of: Ron Grandison, Ramon
Rivas, Mark Acres, Kevin
Gamble. _

and 12 rebounds as the Huskies,
15-9 overall and 6-8 in the con-

iigference, kept alive their slim

wins.

Nineteen of those wins are at
home. The Celtics have only two
fewer losses than the struggling
Washington Bullets, 21-31.
Boston has yet to beat a team
with a winning record on the
road. And Boston finds itself in
the not—so—enviable position of
holding the final playoff spot in
an eight-team format.

A once seemingly invincible
team has become nothing more
than ordinary, and even less than
that on the road, where the Celts
sport an abysmal 6-21 record.

Many say this should not come
as a surprise. While the rest of the
league restocked with fresh,
young talent, the Celtics plodded
from championship season to
championship season with the
same group of All-Stars. As age
caught up with them, so would
the rest of the league.

But that's not even the case.

With Bird gone, the Celtics have
come to rely on McHale and Par-
ish more than ever, and they have
come through with flying colors.

Parish is second in the league
in rebounding, averaging over 12

per game. His field goal percen-
tage, as always, ranks in the top
10.

McHale is still the same long-
armed rebounder and staunch
defender that he has been since

his days as the Celtics’ sixth man.

Even Reggie Lewis, who
swings between small forward
and shooting guard, has filled in
well during Bird's absence, aver-
aging over 16 points per game.

No, individual performances
are not the problem. Chemistry

As the Celtic starting five move
toward retirement age, the youn-
ger players have yet to become
entirely acclimated to the Boston
system. Without Bird, who can
create from any point on the floor
and make every one of his team-
mates a better player, they may
never get a chance to participate
in the so-called Celtic ”mys-
tique" that has carried the team
for so many years.

With Bird and Ainge gone, the
Celtics have fewer offensive
threats, particularly from the out-
side, where they are virtually in-
effective. Shut down Parish and
McHale inside —— which, of
course, is no easy task — and you

_ What hockey really needs are better fights

fl

 

Brian O'Neill has been one of
the busiest men in hockey this
season. O'Neill is in charge of
disciplinary actions given to NHL
players who demonstrate unac-
ceptable levels of violence, spe-
cifically with a deliberate attempt
to injure another player.

This has been hockey’s ugliest
season. The violence displayed
on the ice has been a far cry from
the "fist fights" one usually thinks
of. The problem is that players are
refusing to keep their sticks
down. Instead of using their lum-
ber to control the puck or legally
tie up a player driving to the net,
the NHL is currently using sticks
as weapons.

guin games this year, and I have
not seen one good fight yet. All
these "tough guys” seem to do is
push and shove and grab each
other and wait until one of the
referees jumps in to break it up.

Most notable was the game I at-
tended when the Penguins en-
countered the Rangers for the first
time since the Shaw—Lemieux in-
cident. Now, granted, there was
a lot of hype about getting back

at the Rangers for what they did
to Lemieux, especially from en-
forcer Steve Dykstra. However,
absolutely nothing happened ex-
cept some wimpy jersey pulling,
a lot of name calling and a lot of
empty threats.

Hey guys, if you say you're go-
ing to do something about an in-
justice done to your team, then
please, do something.

Players simply have no respect
for one another. Years ago, if two
players were going to fight, they
just dropped the gloves, went at
it and eventually saw who the
victor would be.

Today, nobody fist fights for
fear of being thrown out of the
game. Instead, tension builds
throughout hockey games to the
point where somebody uses his
stick as a lethal weapon. Instead
of being thrown out of one game,
he'll get suspended for one or
more games for an action which,
if committed on the streets,
would label him a criminal.

Hockey, by nature, breeds frus-
tration, harsh physical contact
and escalating temperaments.
What better way to relieve your-
self of this than a fist fight?

Now don't go thinking I'm a
sadist. I'm simply trying to choose
the lesser of the two evils. Tell me
how a bunch of frustrated play-
ers are going to relieve their ten-

sions by pushing, shoving,
finding new ways to insult each
others’ mothers, and having this
little tiff broken up by a referee.

Ever notice that players hardly
ever drop their gloves until a
referee comes into the picture?
Guys — if you are really angry,
if you want to fight, drop your
gloves and start hitting each other
BEFORE the ref gets to both of
you.

But all this wimpy shoving, su-
pervised by an NHL referee, sim-
ply leads to even higher tensions
which result in unacceptable
types of violence which are few
and far between compared to the
tiffs that brought them on.

I transferred to Pitt from the
University of Vermont, and I used
to travel to Montreal to watch the
Canadiens play. I remember the
I987 playoffs when Montreal
took on Philadelphia. I went to all
four games in the Forum, and
right before one game, both
teams (including the benches)
dropped their sticks and their
gloves during the pre-game
warm—ups and pounded the day-
lights out of each other. The en-
tire series was marked by good,
physical, crisp hockey and an oc-
casional fist fight. There was no
stick swinging or wimpy jersey
tugging — hockey like it oughta
be. My, what a pleasure it was to
watch. .

fashioned brawls come back to

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, February 27, T989

6 Pirates’ Dunne hopes that winter
league will get back rookie form

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

BRADENTON, Fla. —- Most
major leaguers reported to camp
last week, but Mike Dunne’s
spring training began in
November.

The Pittsburgh Pirates’ right-

O hander was the National League's

9

top rookie pitcher in 1987, going
13-6. He slumped to 7-11 last
season as he ‘ battled control
problems and, just as important,
his confidence.

Dunne, determined to figure
out why his earned run average
climbed almost a full point last
season, volunteered to pitch for
the Pirates’ Florida Instructional
League team last fall.

Pirates pitching coach Ray
Miller welcomed the chance to
test Dunne’s arm — and get in-

side his head.

”Mike’s a quiet guy, an in-
troverted guy, and it was a
chance to get to know him bet-
ter as a person, to work with him
for four or five hours a day with
no fans and no media around,”

9 Miller said. ”I think he learned a

lot himself. ‘

”By the end of camp, he'd
come up with a new pitch [the
curve] and was helping teach the
younger pitchers. It was great to
see him standing there in front of
a group, teaching some kids who

A were obviously in awe of him.”

Dunne, 26, didn't get as much

5 respect from opposing hitters last

season. Theyibegan laying off his
”out” pitch, his sinker, and as
Dunne consistently fell behind in

the count, his other pitches, es— ‘

pecially his slider, weren't as ef-
fective.

”He’d get behind in the count
and he'd start questioning himself
and he'd lose his confidence,”
Manager Jim Leyland said. ”Ray
had a lot of success with him in
the fall and. he's happy with the
way he is throwing the curve.”

’’I was throwing it for strikes [in
the Instructional League],” said
Dunne, who reached terms Satur-
day on a one—year contract. ”I
know I was facing prospects, hit-
ters who are two and three years
away from the major leaguer, but
they're still hitters.” ,

If he can regain his control,
Dunne said, there's no reason
why he can't be effective as he
was in 1987, when he had a 3.03
ERA. ’

I ”To blame what happened last
year on the sinker is just an ex-
cuse,” he said. ”What I've got to
do is start throwing the first pitch
for a strike. When I fell ‘behind

last year, I'd try to lay it over the
middle of the plate.

’’I couldn't get in a groove. I'd
win one game, not make it to the
fifth inning in the next game, then
I'd get a no-decision.”

Dunne started the Pirates’ sea-
son Opener, but went on the dis-
abled list a day later with a
strained muscle in his rib cage, a
nagging injury that first deve-
loped in spring training. He
returned in May.

In nearly the same number of
innings (170) as he pitched in
1987 (163), Dunne walked 20
more batters, struck out two few-
er and gave up 20 more hits. His
ERA jumped to 3.92.

”But I don't feel like I had a bad
year,” he said. ”My record was

7-11, but we won eight of the
other 10 games I started, and I
think my pitching had a lotto do
with it. I just didn't get the wins.”
Miller knows how important a
well Dunne would be to his staff
this season. The 6-foot,
2OO—p0und Dunne took off 15
pounds in the ‘off-season and
reported to camp ”stronger and
lighter and as good of shape as
I've ever been,” Dunne said.

”People ‘said he had that
sophomore jinx, but I looked at
the statistics, and I know he had
a lot of quality starts for us,"
Miller said. ”This season, he's got
a new pitch and he's healthy.
He's back to being Mike Dunne.”

Celtics

Continued from page 7

Paxson and Johnson are on the
verge of retirement, leaving only
Lewis and Shaw in the backcourt.
Even with age at every position,
the Celtics desperately need a do
it—all guard in the upcoming draft.
Todd Lichti of Stanford, perhaps?
He'll almost certainly be availa-
ble in the middle of the first
round, where Boston will pick,
should they play at the same rate
they are now.

The Celtics believe they helped
themselves in the frontcourt by
picking up Kleine and Pinckney.
Perhaps. Kleine was a lottery pick
from Arkansas in 1985. Pinckney
was the 10th overall pick in the
same season. However, both are
merely average players in a fran-
chise whose fans have become
accustomed to superstars.

weekend, the end of an era is
nearing in Boston.

Bird, who has said that he will
play into the 19905, was expect-
ed to return by March, just in
time to give the Celts the lift they
needed to get into the playoffs.
His return has now been pushed
back until at least mid-March,
and should it take longer than
that to become rehabilitated, Bird
will likely sit out the rest of the
season rather than jeopardize
what little time remains in his il-
lustrious career.

McHa|e, despite his contribu-

tions to the great Boston teams of

the early 1980s, may become
trade bait before next season.

Johnson is already on his way
out, supplanted by Shaw. Kleine
will likely play the middle when
Parish retires, unless the Celtics
can package a trade as they have
done so many times before.

Lewis will continue to start at
one position or another even if
Bird returns.

The Celtics will not fold; that is
certain. But in the upcoming
years, a transition will take place
in Boston. By 1992, the Celtics
will still be fighting. But this time
it will be to earn recognition and
respect, not their 18th world
championship.
