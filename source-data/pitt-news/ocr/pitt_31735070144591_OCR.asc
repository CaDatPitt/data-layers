oust

humans again

by Kelly Thomas
Staﬁ” Writer‘

The carnage is over. The zom-
bies won.

“Humans vs. Zombies,” a
c_ampus—wide game of tag played
at colleges across the country,
wrapped up another successful
game at Pitt last week.

While tabling for the event in
Towers before the game started
on Feb. 1, Shane Price, the group’s
vice president, said the game pro-
vided a fun escape for students.

“It breaks up the monotony
of walking to classes,” said Price.
“It becomes fun.”

Business manager Tim Cogan
agreed.

“lt’s also entertaining to shoot
strangers with Nerf guns and for
them to be OK with it,” he said.

The point of the game is to
stay human as long as possible.
All players except three original
zombies start out as humans and
try to beat back the growing zom-
bie horde. Humans carry Nerf

guns, balled—up socks and foam
swimming noodles in place of
shotguns and chainsaws to im-
mobilize their zombie rivals.
When a zombie has been
tagged, he cannot turn a human
into a zombie for 15 minutes. If
this were a real zombie attack, it
would be like shooting the legs off
the zombie and waiting for him
to crawl up the stairs_ to your hid-
ing place to eat you. Zombies tag
humans when they ﬁrmly touch
the human, and they must do so
once every 48 hours or starve to
death. The human must then turn
over his corpse for consumption
by the zombie and then succumb
to the zombie horde.
Cogan said that games usually
run. from 10 days to two weeks.
“After two weeks players get a
little tired of playing,” he said.
This semester, unlikeprevious

ones, the club plans on running‘

two games. Price pointed out that
people who buy Nerf guns for
the game like to get more use out

If you ever caught Kevan Smith
 between  reps at quar-
terbad<, chances are it wasn’t because he
was tired.

He might have  been 
his other position.

“He told me  football prac-
tices thathe would squat down betwwi
plays to practice his catching,” saidWalt
Smith, Kevan’s dad. “I don’t think he
ever gave up the opportunity that he
mightbeabletbplaybaseball.”

Now Kevan doesn’t crouch be-
tween reps, but  them. After
ﬁnishing last football season as Pitt’s
with the team, Smith dedded his ﬁitiure

Pitt psychology professor Rich-

when it comes to couch bunting but
as a social psychologist; he understands
how  behavior changes when
people gather in a group.

’ “There -is considerable evidence
that people misbehave more often in

 

 

groups than they do when alone,” said

Moreland in an e-mail, ‘.‘and this gap ,

in behavior gets worse the larger the

When people ﬁnd themselves in

Moreland, they tend to feel

quickly spread to dozens of other colleges,
high schools and military bases, according
to its official Web site.

Depending on the school, the games can
be complicated or simple. Some schools
write stories and use plots as backdrops for
their games, while others plan missions for
their players to make things more intense.
For example, Goucher’s storyline involves
a meteor with alien microbes to turn its
students into ﬂesh—deVouring zombies.

A mission could include having a group
of humans “securing” a location and then
being rewarded with bonus points or anti-
zombie vaccinations. Some schools make
these missions mandatory, but Pitt does
not. ,

Murphy said the game is usually played
at smaller campuses. She’s not sure it works
out as well on city campuses like Pitt’s.

“I only heard that someone almost got
pushed into trafﬁc,” she said. “I don’t know
if they actually were, but I could deﬁnitely
see that happening. Some people got a little
too into it.”

Murphy said that she was interested in
zombies and what might happen in an ac-
tual attack.

“It is really scary to play the game be-
cause you’re being hunted down,” she said.
“I was recognizable —— an easy target.”

Price said there have been some injuries
during the course of the game, but all play-
ers have been required to sign waivers since

the game became an official club registered
with Pitt last spring.

“They haVen’t blamed anyone for it or
anything. Everyone seems to realize that
these things can happen. They just Visit the
hospital (if necessary) and then move on,”
he said in an e—mail. '

Cogan added that most injuries were
caused by normal rough-housing.

“Mostly the normal bruises will happen
when you trip or get a door closed on you,”
he said.

Although “Humans vs. Zombies” is
open to any Pitt students and faculty mem-
bers, the game requires that players spend
at least severalhours on campus a day, so
the majority of players live on campus.

“Most of the people playing now are
the people who started,” added Cogan.

Some of those players have attained
legendary status within the game’s com-
munity. P

“Everyone’s heard about me,” joked
Cogan.

He said that in the spring 2007 game
a player who managed to stay human
throughout the game earned the nickname
“Captain America” because of a giant blue
noodle and his efforts to protect other hu-
man players.

’“He ran around shuttling people plac-
es,” said Price.

Price added, “There was a guy named
Twitchy. Because he was very twitchy.”

Part of the reason for this re-
striction stems from the desire of
families of the deceased to keep
the matter private The military also
believes the practice spares the sol-
diers’ loved ones from competing
with the press: Essentially, if the
media will be there to cover the ar-

 rival of the bodies, some families
 feel obligated to be there as well.

A soldier’s decision to join the

 military is a public act. He foregoes

 some soldiers get killed in action.
 But upon their bereavement, their
E role, responsibility and title as sol-

diers do not simply disappear.

The ongoing wars in Afghani-
stan and Iraq occur half a world
away from American soil. Save
for the occasional bumper sticker
asking U.S. civilians to “Support

 Our Troops,” some Americans

undoubtedly feel disconnected and

 uninﬂuenced by the real scope of

' these wars. In a large sense, civilians

back home can’t be held account-

able for seemingly apathetic dispo-

of fallen troops coming home.
The image of a casket draped in
an American ﬂag provides an im-
age of unparalleled sacriﬁce in the
name of patriotism and service to
our country. Such an image will
surely stir feelings even in those
who don’t have immediate family
or loved ones serving overseas,

This image also brings the war
into perspective for the thousands
whose only connection to the wars
comes from TV updates, news
headlines and radio sound bites. It’s
upsetting to hear statistics d tailing
the number of soldiers killed in
combat, yet the image of even one
soldier’s cofﬁn unloaded from an
aircraft captures a reality that
statistics sometimes can’t match.

The reversal of such a cont:ro—
versial policy would be in vain if
Americans dwell on these feelings
of gloom, though. Perhaps media
coverage would spark increased
resentment toward these wars, or
perhaps it would stir a sense of
poignant pride in the fallen sol-
diers. Either way, a turnaround of
the policy would strengthen Ameri-
cans’ connection to our wars over-
seas.

Hope for 'hopetastic' stimulus

 
    

by Lewis Lehe
Columnidt

Congress passed the Senate’s ver-
sion of the economic stirnulus plan
last Friday. Nearing $800 billion, the
stimulus is the largest single piece of
fiscal policy in US. history.

While Congress was  its
heels, one brave man was pushing
his own economic stimulus plan for a
decade That man is Matthew Lesko
His suit is covered in question marks,
but Matthew I.esko has the answers
-— gobs and gobs of answers and un-
beatable values for unbeatable Ameri-
cans with American values Before
Congress ever decided to dole out
billions for energy, health, infrastruc-
ture and tax cuts, Matthew Lesko told
people how they could do the same
and more with  laws and gov-
ernment programs

"What is the point of an economic
stimulus plan?

We’re in a recession. A recession is
sort of a paradox if you think about it
Somehow there are the same amounts
of machines, workers and knowledge
as a year ago, but a lot less stuff is
getting made There are unemployed
people who want stuff, and other un-
employed people who can  it to
them Yet somehow they just cannot
employ each other to get the stuff
they want: Clearly, stuff is broken.

As long as that stuﬁ is broken,
most people with money are scared
and want to save it in case  get
even worse But as everyone steps

‘i up their saving all at once, prices and

wages start  and the debt people
owe becomes an even greater share

of their income. So by saving more
quickly, consumers and companies
actually grow deeper in debt.

A stimulus is meant to invigorate

whatjohn Maynard Keynes called the
“animal spirits” of business people
It is meant to make companies con-
ﬁdent that spending money now on
stuff —— stuff like machines, buildings,
research,  and labor — will re-
turn proﬁts in the future Optimism
becomes a self—fulﬁlling prophecy:
Each business’ investments go well
because workers and other businesses
are  to spend While everyone
is busy  new processes and
technologies are discovered that let us

make even more stuff with the same

amount of stuff

But a stimulus is only sleight of
hand. You’re getdng more money
now, but your taxes will have to pay it
backinthe ﬁiture. If folks thinktoo
hard about the debt, theyfll just save
the stimulus money for later. And
then we’re back where we started!

The stimulus has to make people
feel like theyfre  free stuff
If that makes them invest, and the
economy grows, to some extent it will
actually be free stuff since now there’s
more economy to tax and pay back

as .
H A stimulus is only sleight of
hand  If folks think too hard
about the debt, they’ll just save
the stimulus money for later.
And then we’re back where we

started!

Enter Matthew Lesko! With titles
like “Gobs and Gobs of Free Stuff,”

and gobs of it.

But alas, as if deliberately oppos-

ing Lesko’s efforts, President Obama ,

sober manner send a frank message .

Obama has pulled off. America is in
a ﬁx that demands something more
than hopeful —— something “hopetas-
tic” Obama needs to start  up
words like “hopetastic”

Obama could get people spending
more if he rolled into a random strip-
mallparkinglot, drivinga car covered
in question marks, stepped out wear-
ing a suit covered in question marks
and confirmed Lesko’s conviction that
“The government has gone crazy!”
This should be Obama’s next
speech: »

“I am feeling HOPETASTIC! We

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com'

    

by Mark Kozlowski
Columm}/t

Recently I had an old Motown
song stuck in my head: “When you
believe in  that you don’t un-

derstand, then you suffer. Supersti- -

tion ain’t the way.”

Even in our supposedly enlight-
ened, post-atomic, post—microchip,
post-Internet era, silliness abounds.
Some people refuse to step on
cracks in the sidewalk, some won’t
pick up a coin unless it’s facing
heads up and some athletes won’t
even wash their socks until they
lose a game.

A lot of these superstitions
don’t make much sense. First, why
is 13 considered unlucky while sev-
en is lucky and, say, 17 and 19 are
completely undistinguished? All of
these numbers are prime. Granted‘,
seven is the most likely roll on a
pair of dice, but if weplay dice
with dodecahedrons, that is, a solid
with 12 faces, 13 would be the most

 
 

. Science should

likely roll.

The luckiness or unluckiness
of__a number varies by culture. In
Poland, for example, you shouldn’t
give somebody a dozen roses —
odd numbers are the way to go.
The number seven is considered
unlucky in China, yet six and eight

, are lucky.

Astrology is another big super-
stition. Philip Plait, in his excellent
book “Bad Astronomy,” explains
how gravity and electromagnetic
effects ——-' two mechanisms re-
sponsible for other planets’ sup-
posed inﬂuence on Earth’s func-
tions — are miniscule because of
the vast distances involved. From a
gravitational standpoint, the moon
has much larger effects on Earth
than other planets do, which we see
clearly in the tides.

Tackling every single supersti-
tion extant is not possible, yet these
two are popular ones. Why do peo-
ple believe in them?

The ﬁrst explanation relates
to human psychology. We tend to

. remember the things that are note-
worthy, like James Harrison’s 100-

/

supersede superstition

yard runback, and forget things not
so noteworthy, like the disappoint-
ing TV commercials. When our
superstitions correctly predicted
something,- we remember that oc-
casion. We quickly forget, however,
those times we walked underneath
a ladder and were not run over by
the 71A. Forgetting when a super-

‘ stition was wrong and remember-

ing when it was coincidentally right
reinforces the belief but never dis-
credits it.

.2’

Big deal if some people ‘won’t
leave their house because the
Queen of Cups and the Jack of
Napes turned up the last time they
. consulted their tarot deck. At least
they aren’t busy crowding the 71A
that you failed to get hit by. .

~ E?

Superstition also seeks to explain
those phenomena that are other-
wise unexplainable. Early mariners

— a superstitious bunch indeed -

did not have Doppler radar, long-
term climate studies and NASA

satellites toexplain something very
important to them: the weather.
Shooting an albatross seemed as
good a -reason for misfortune as an
area of persistent low pressure ——

_ and humans want to understand

things. Why else did we ever start
studying the world and developing
the very science that allows me to
laugh at superstition today? These
‘superstitions pre-date science and
have been around long enough for

i them to be firmly ingrained.

The ﬁnal and perhaps ‘most
compelling reason that folks trust
superstitions is that they don’t want
to face the Shakespearean postulate

. that “The fault, dear Brutus, is not

in our stars, / But in ourselves.”
When it comes to a bad test
grade, for example, it’s always much
easier to blame something other
than your poor study habits. Maybe

you were born under the constella-

tion of Cygnus. Superstition serves
to excuse our faults and ﬂaws.
So why should the scientiﬁcally

‘minded care about ‘superstitions?

Big deal if some people won’t leave
their house because th'e Queen of

Cups and the Jack of Napes turned
up the’ last time they consulted their
tarot deck. At least they aren’t busy
crowding the 71A that you failed to
get hit by.

Well, we should care. People
make a lot of money from this
kind of claptrap: A Web site of-
fered a numerological reading on
my relationship status, for the low,
low price of $29.95. I think they
even threw in the shipping and
handling. '

Personally, I’ll take a  to
lunch for that price and probably
get a better result ’

Finally, superstition and scien-
tiﬁc misconception are often com-
palnions.

In an era that demands scien-
tiﬁc solutions to major problems
like global water shortages, food

difﬁculties and alternative energy,

an ignorant public is no’ asset.

With any luck’, we can leave su-
perstitions behind us and realize, in
the words of Stevie Wonder, “Su-
perstition ain’t the way.”

To the Editor,

If anyone at the University needed convincing that The Pitt News is a trashy publication, last Fridays “Sex

Issue” put that issue to bed — pun intended. ~

. last Fridays edition, which for the record contained no news from the day before, read more like a Playboy
thananewspaper. Iflwantedthelatestoirthe  club  aboutthetrendiestcondoms oraporno
review,Iwouldhavefirstlookedinaseedycomerstore. Noviglknowtoreach fpracopyof ThePittNews

When a porn stars biography takes precedence over campus news, the disconnect between the publication - .
and its purpose as a newspaper is complete and indisputable. Tell me, how" many people showed up for the job
fair on Thursday? How about Richard Sobo ’s “Jews in Ugan ” presentation? What about CWO’s rendition

of “The Vagina Monologues” that opened Thursday night? Too tame to print?’

To the Editor,

I was disappointed to see the‘ photograph accompanying “A safe sex life is a

_ happy sex life” in last Friday’s issue. The picture of a girl tearing open a condom
with her teeth ‘exhibits a very unsafe sex practice. _

Condoms should always be ripped open with your ﬁngers so as not to damage

the condom and defeat its very purpose of protection. For an article, and an entire

issue about safe sex, I expected images to complement the words that encourage
safe sex practices. ' T

Excluding Pitt students en-
rolled in thejazz studies program,
the question “just what is Afro-
Peruvian jazz music?” mightihave
crossed your mind.

“Nothing is set invstone,” said
Alegria. “Afro-Peruvian jazz is a
vehicle for improvisation.”

4 In geographic terms, Afro—Pe—
ruvian jazz is a style differentiated

        

from American and Latin jazz in
its speciﬁc celebration of the mu-
sical traditions created by African
slaves on the coast of Peru.
Musically, this form of jazz
hesitates in using the standard
rhythmic patterns illustrated ‘by
its popular Afro—Cuban predeces-

SOI. ~

The clave, a rhythmic device‘

used to frame song structure in
most forms of Latin jazz, is not
_present in the group’s preferred
playing style, which separates it
from something like a salsa.
“There are different levels of
rhythm in Afro—Peruvian jazz,”
said Alegriaf
doesn’t use patterns‘, which makes
the music sound more African.”
Still a little confused?

A “Mouth to Mouth” has finally
come to Pittsburgh, and not just in
Valentine’s Day activities.- Quantum
Theatre’s latest production is filling
the Cultural District with drama.

Frank, played by Ken Bolden,
is a rniddle—aged gay man who ex-
plores his relationships through
a dialogue that is both emotional
and hilarious in playwright Kevin
Elyot’s drama.

Boos, whose prodigal son has just
returned home ‘from an eye—open-
ing study abroad experience. From
there, it becomes the tragiciirony
of life intertwined with comedic
conversations. —

It’s the ‘story of middle-aged
Americans, through a study of re-K"
lationships, failed and attempted.
opportunities, and most of all, the
difficulty of communication.

‘.‘I think that "college-aged kids
will see their parents, maybe they I
can see them through an objective
light to try to understand where
adults are coming from,” said
Boos. '

But, it might also be a chance
to laugh at “old” age, pushing back
the responsibilities to which real
adults must commit.

Boos wanted to show “Mouth”

since she first saw the play nearly
10 years ago. Now, as the mother

of a teenager about to go off to
college, she is beginning to under-
stand the fear and excitement that

“I did not see myself as Laura
when I ﬁrst saw the play, but now

said.

Boos has a unique.perspec-

Quantum Theatre in 1990 with a
mission to “bring forth artists forg-

believes in the “primacy of the per

She works with actors to help

them hone their craft and make the ‘

— aren’t fairy tales.

In its essence, “Waltz With

his apartment to kill him. Intrigued

and disturbed, Folman sets off
on a quest to recapture his own
memory of the war, for better or
for worse. -

“Waltz With Bashir” falls
into one of ﬁlm’s most eccentiic
genres: the animated documen-
tary. This means that the recorded
conversations — usually between
Folman and others —- are real, but
the scenes are drawn, instead of

. ﬁlmed.

The movie begins with a
frighteningly real rendition of the
friends nightmare. The dream
world is doused in a blue-yellow
color scheme, and the dogs are
made more intimidating by the
exaggerations of animation and a
harrowing electronic soundtrack.
From there, we’re taken on a diz-
zying journey through the minds
and memories of Folman’s fellow
soldiers. , -

Just after the ﬁrst few inter-
views,‘ Folman’s memory comes
ﬂooding back in fantastically sur-

real anirnatiori, adding to the dark‘

collage of stories the  pres-

that’s wheeling crazily through the
night. See a young Folman stalk-
ing through the underbrushas an
RPG flies past him. See a young
Folman watching an approaching
van in the night through the cross
hairs of his weapon.

But Folman does not conﬁne
himself to just interviewing sol-
diers. Psychiatrists and TV anchors

’ all help make this a study of not just

theI_.ebanonWar,butrnemoryitself.
Of course, every ﬁlm must
have a climax. Of particular inter-

.est to Folman is where he and oth-

ers were during the infamous mas-

sacre of Palestinians by Lebanese '

Phalangists in the Sabra and Shatila
refugee camps. In this way, the last
30 minutes of “Waltz With Bashir”

when the credits begin to roll.
The choice of animating such a
ﬁlm seems odd at ﬁrst, but after
it’s done, you get thesense that it
couldn’t have been made any other
way. In cine'ma, animation equals
freedom — the freedom to delve
freely into the fantastic, without
costly special effects.

For instance, there are two song

sequences that the ﬁlm couldn’t .
have carried out nearly as effective—,

ly without animation. _Ari Folman
owes a great deal to his director of
animation, _Yoni Goodman, who
was able to turn people’s vague
memories into vivid, unforgettable

sequences. .

' “Waltz With Bashir” is one of
those few ‘movies that attempts to
do a lot — in this case, investigate,
illuminate and articulate the Leba-

. non War —— and actually succeeds.
The eclectic puzzle pieces of these‘ .
veterans’ stories are put together i

just right, and the resulting picture
is a harrowing one.

It would have been nice to get a
sense of closure at the end, to hear
Folman or one of his friends give‘
a monologue that would tie every-
 together once and for all,
but the ﬁlm’s raw ending packs a
punch that’ll leave viewers reeling.

interpreting responses to the Lebanon War.

Alegria's sextet to groove

Afro-Peruvian, page 10

expression while respecting and honoring
the history of jazz in both the American
and Latin genres. ~ .

“It is a form of musical storytell-
ing about different places,” said Alegria.
“We want the audience to have an ap-
preciation and joy for what we do.”

The sextet consists of prominent jazz
musicians Freddy ‘.‘Hu_evito” Lobaton on
percussion, Hugo Alcazar on drums, Yuri
Juarez on guitar, Laura Andrea Leguia on
saxophone and Ramon de Bruyn on bass
guitar and vocals with Alegria featured on
trumpet. _

Born in Lima, Alegria is one of Peru’s
most celebrated performers. “Famous”
runs in the ‘family as Alegria’s grandfather
Ciro was Peru’s most famous novelist and
his father Alonso is Peru’s most acclaimed
playwright. ‘ 0 T

Alegriareceived his formal training in
the United States, receiving a doctorate in
jazz studies from USC, a,master’s from City
University of New York and a bachelor’s
from Kenyon'College. He is _currently the
associate director of jazz studies at NYU.

‘ On his latest recording, Nuevo Mzmdo,
Alegria collaborates with musicians Tier-
ney Sutton, Bobby Shew and Russell Fer-
rante. ‘

In the past, he has performed with mu-
sical legends Maria Schneider, Placido-Do-
mingo and Ingrid Jensen.

“The material Gabriel and his associates
are producing is nothing short of historic,”
said Shew. V S

Alegria chose the trumpet to be his
weapon of choice b_ecause “it is a powerful
instrument that dictates what is going on in
the music.” .

Inﬂuenced by the music of jazz legends
Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock, Alegria
returned to his Peruvian roots after receiv-

. ing his collegiate education about ﬁve years
ago. The Afro-Peruvian Sextet followed a
year later.

Alegria and company offers to take fans
of the genre straight to the Peruvian coast
for some firsthand experience with the re-

' cently established “Tour Peru” concept.

In 2008, an audience of about 40, in-
cluding four college students, left with the
band on a 10-day musical tour of Alegria’s
native country. Three college interns under
the tutelage of Alegria also made the trip.

Traveling with the sextet by bus across
the Peruvian countryside, tour-goers were

treated to spectacular ‘cuisine, scenery and ’

music. ,
Continuing the successful endeavor. in
-2009, Alegria’s “Tour Peru” with all the
ﬁxings will cost a patron less than $2500
plus personal airfare. Alegria’s Pittsburgh
performance will cost considerably less at
only $25.50 per ticket.
Gabriel Alegria’s

Afro-Peruvian

Sextet will play The Cabaret at The--
atre Square for one night only, return-—-

ing to Pittsburgh after a two-year hiatus.

. “There is an energy we want people to
experience,” said Alegria. “Come away hav-
ing fun.”

tions a pleasure to. watch. Actors often act in
spaces that enhance their work. In pastiper-

formances such as “Breakfast with Mugabe,” -
the play was held in an ofﬁce building where I

remodeling was occurring.

Space is once again an important part of
this play. ‘

Like Quantum’s other plays, “Mouth to
Mouth” is not set in a traditional theatrical
space, but rather in a Downtown loft, look-
 over other apartments. The space is in-
timate and forces the audience to step inside
the characters’ lives, literally. .

“We were going to use someone’s actual
apartment, setting the stage in the family
room, right in front of the master bedroom,”
said Boos. .

_ Eventually, they developed the urban

space, using the building’s characteristics to .

highlight today’s city existence.

Throughout the play, the characters never
leave the stage. They might leave the central
area to go ‘into the background or play the
piano, but they are never out of the audi-
ence’s view. 0 A

“It is weird when you are in the  off-
stage, and then onstage aga.i_n,’.’ said Boos, but
in this way, the character is constantly devel-
oped, even when not speaking.

The setting of “Mouth to Mouth” gives
actors the ability to say so much more by be-
ing off ‘ screen ' '

Quantum Theatre has a unique ability to
work with artists and space to create plays
that explain and explore. “Mouth to Mouth”
should prove to be the ‘same. .

i just because Valentine’s Day is over, the
“Mouth to Mouth” doesn’t need to end. i

I knew that if I didn’t accept that of-
fer that it might slip out of my ﬁngers”

Walt saw that eagerness come
through in his son, who he’d seen star
through every level of baseball and
thought would pursue baseball in the
future.

“Football came along in his senior
year when he went to a couple show-
cases and workouts, and that’s when
things started blossoming,” said Walt
“It took over his life for six to eight
months, and I guess he fdt like the op-
portunitywith footballwastioogoodtzo
pass up?’

Smith was a talented quarterback
As a senior, he threw for 1,538 yards
and eight touchdowns for a 1-9 Seneca

_ Valleyteam,andhewas ratedasone of

the top 50 quarterbacks in the country
by Scoutcorn. So his decision to follow

3 football wasn’t outrageous when he

signed his letter of intent in February
2006. But, he wanted to keep the idea
of a baseball ﬁiture alive.

That meant one of two possibilities:
trytoplayboth footballandbaseballat
Pitt, which Smith  wanted to do,
orbedraftedhighenoughbyanl\/[LB
club and be offered a contract juicier
than playing college football and 
a free education.

The latter might not have

I spoke with his baseball coaches and

special.’ And that’s when they had men-
tioned that he seemed to be leaning to
wards football.” '

Jordano couldn’t compete with
football. Pitt football can  out 85

Now a catcher, Pitt's Kevan Smith is back to playing the sport in

which he excelled his entire life.

to Blue Jays and the Pittsbuigh Pirates,
who even followedhim toroad games

As close as the scouts‘ got with

Smith, though, he saw them back away 4

upon mention of the ‘ ‘C’ ’ word -—— col-
legs-

"The word around the  ‘

borough was that my education was
important to me,” said Smith, “and if
they got me as a pick, the chance wasn’t
 for meto  of the
whole football scholarship

“I was a litt:le nervous because as

ucation was real important to me,” he
added. ‘hndl uied notto show thattzo
the MLB scouts, because I didn’t want
to limit my opportunities with that part

So with no guarantees from any-

Fifty rounds passed, though, and
Smith’s name didn’t appear on any
team’sdraftlist. Soitwas Pittfootball
for him. He joined the team at quarter-
back and redshirted his freshman year,
put on some muscle and showed a
heap of promise, often labeled as Pitt’s
strongest arm. In thespnng of 2007,
Smith and current starter Bill Stull jock-
eyed -for the starting job

Though Stull won it out of 
camp the next August, Smith started
three games when Stull was lost for
the season with a thumb injury in Pitt’s
opener He threw for 202 yards in the
next game against Grambling State,
and started at  State and at
home against Connecticut. He was
eventually passed over, though, for
highly recruited freshman Pat Bostick
And when Stull came back healthy for

Pitt guard Shavonte Zellous, shown playing against Notre Dame, scored 16
points Sunday night, but it wasn't enough to push Pitt past Connecticut.

Connecticut slams
Panther Women  

by Robbie Kleinmuntz
Staﬂ Wrtter

The Pitt women’s basketball
team’s seven-game  streak
came to an  halt Sunday
night as it lost on the road to No.
1-ranked Connecticut 9542.

The Panthers, sporting their pink
uniforms in honor of the legendary
Kay Yow, who died of breast cancer
last month, scored just 21 points in
eachhalf. Itwas the least No.19 Pitt
(18-5, 8-3 Big East) scored in one
half in school history. It was also the
Panthers’ worst loss since 2002 when
the Huskies beat them 112-43.

Pitt’s Shavonte Zellous led the
Panthers with 16 points and ﬁve re-
bounds. She was the only starter who
shot better than 40 percent for Pitt.
Shayla Scott had eight points and six
rebounds, and as a team, Pitt shot 25
percent overall,  2—of—19 from
3-point range

Connecticut (25—0, 11-0), the only
unbeaten team in the country, darted
out to a 22-3 lead at the 14:31 markin
the ﬁrst half and never looked back
The Huskies had big contributions
from just about everyone, as it was
the second time this season in which
all five of the Huskies starters scored
in double digits.

Renee Montgomery scored 20
points for the Huskies It was Mont-
gomeryfs 127th consecutive start Be-
fore the game, she became the first
active player to have her jersey put up
in the Huskies of Honor.

Connecticut also had solid pro-
duction ftom Maya Moore, who

scored 18 points and grabbed 12 .

rebounds. She’s scored in double
digits for the Huskies in every game
this season It was her 14th double-.-.
double on the year.

But Pitt isn’t the only team that’s
seen what Connecticut can do. The
Huskies have been unstoppable all
year. Their smallest  of vic-
tory this season was an 11-point?
win against  Tech (82-71) in
their season opener. Connecticut has
already beaten three teams ranked
in the top 10 by a  of 28.7
points.

Pitt hasn’t ‘beaten Connecticut"
since 1993 — a span that stretches
over 24 games The Panthers have
not beaten the Huskies on the road
since 1986. Connecticut now leads
the all-time series against the Pan-
thers 37-9. "1

Pitt, which is now 3-4 against
ranked teams this season, will face
Villanova at home on Wednesday at
7 p.m.
