Sweeping Changes

Of Student Senate

By JIM NELSON

Student Government. president
Richard Sobota’s plan to com-
pletely reorganize SG to make it
a “truly representative organiza-
was
transferred into a subcommittee
after a short question and answer
period Monday.

Sobota’s plan calls for the sen-
ators to remove themselves from
office, and elect into power the

presidents of Men’s Council, As- '

sociated Women Students, Inter-
fraternity Council, Pan Hellenic
Council, Dorm ‘Council, Women’s

-Dorm Council, Engineering and

Mines Cabinet. and Business Ad-
ministration ‘Cabinet (until i965).
Same Old Problem

In presenting his plan, Sobota
said that the Senate knows that
one of its major problems is in
elfectively representing the stu-
dent body. He pointed out that
this is not at new problem but
that it has existed and been ig-
nored for many years.

“The reason for this problem
is the large number of schools
in the University and the many
governing‘ bodies.” Sobota said.

“With so many governing bodies 7

on campus, SG should try to co-
ordinate these bodies rather
than not recognize them.

“The presidents of these organi-
zations should be the Student
Government. They should work
with a president, vice-president,
secretary, and treasurer elected

by the student body. These gov-‘

erning heads are best qualified to
work with campus activities and
problems because they are more
aware of them than people ran-
domly elected.” Sobotacontinued.

New Funds Designated  
For Atom S

  masher

By TRUDY WEISS

Almost a million dollars has
been awarded to the University by
the National. Science Foundation
for use in large scale nuclear in-
vestigation.

The $977,000 grant will be used
mainly for a new 18 million elec-
tron volt atom smasher, which
will, in effect, replace the Univer-
sity’s 14 year old cyclotron now
housed in a building between Old
Mellon Institute and the new
parking garage on O’Hara Street.

A staff of 40 scientists at the
University will make use of the
new apparatus in their investiga-
tion of nuclear structure.

Theoretical advances in the
knowledge of nuclear ﬁssion, re-
quiring ﬁner measurement ol en-
ergy levels in the nucleus, will be
facilitated by the new machine,
which will enable separate meas-
urements ot the nergy levels in
and around the nucleus.

One of Six Recipients

The atom smasher will be built
bv the High Voltage Engineering
Corp. of Burlington, Mass., and is

expected to be completed late in‘

1963.

A government agency, the Na-
tional S-cicnce Foundatioifs pur-
pose is to help further scien-
tiﬁc research on projects of in-
terest nationally, through money
grants.

Over four million has recently
been granted to six universities
for the three stage accelerators,
which are expected to play a key
role in the closer studies of nu-
clear structures.

The program at the University
will receive up to two million in

Panthers to Remain

At Campus Stadium

By BARRY GROSS
University football fans don’t have to worry about street-
car schedules to the North Side; the Panthers will continue

to play" at Pitt Stadium.
Recommendations made

by the Pittsburgh Regional

Planning Association called for the Panthers to play at the
proposed municipal stadium on the North Side, and for Pitt

Stadium to be cut down to seatO

15,000 for other athletic events.

But Edison Montgomery, direc-
tor of Institutional Planning at the
University, indicated that the
University did not favor these two
suggestions.

“Our position," Montgomery
said, "is that we would like to
continue to play at the Stadium.
The suggestion to switch to the
North Side might be considered a
minor flaw in a blueprint for Oak-
land which we feel is overal.l fav-
orable to the University."

Consider Dorm Students

Montgomery went on toiexplain
why the University would like to
stay at the Stadium. “If this pro-
posal had been made ten years
ago before we had many dormi-
tory students, it would have made
no difference.

“Commuters could travel to
the North Side just as they
travel to Oakland. But now we
have to think of all the dorm
students.”

“Also,” he continued, “we can
imagine scheduling trouble in Sep-
tember at the proposed North Side
Stadium. if professional ‘baseball,
professional football, and college
football. all used the facilities
th.ere."‘

Cites Parking Problem

Montgomery said that the city
would want the University to use
the North Side Stadium for two
reasons. First, the rent the Uni-
versity would pay would help de-
fray the cost of the Stadium; and,
second, the city parking authority
would gain revenue from fans
using their proposed parking ta-
cilities for the North Side.

Parking, Montgomery feels. is
now a problem in Oakland.
“Speciﬁcally, the problem is
free parking,” he said. He
pointed to the 0’Hara Garage
which the University owns and

has leased to a parking lot op-
erator. '

Although the prices charged are
the same as those for lots such as
the Syria Mosque lot, the O’I-lara
stays only one third ﬁlled.

“People are in the habit of
parking elsewhere,” Montgomery
concluded.

not enough. You must have
power to have a strong SG, but
we can’t ask for it. We want to

Concluding the presentation of

that this is a big sacriﬁce. In
voting yourself out of otlice, you
are not degrading yourself or
Student Government. If you
look into the future. you can
see how we will be beneﬁting

A tsmic Horizons

Federal recognition of the physics department as one
of six in the country to share in over four million dollars
for basic research marks a major plateau in the Univer-
sity’s quest for “academic excellence.”

The $997,000 grant given by the National Science
Foundation indicates two things: ﬁrst, that the University
has accomplished signiﬁcant results in the ﬁeld of nuclear
research with cyclotron, and second, that the NSF has
conﬁdence that the University can equal or surpass this
performance with superior equipment in the form of an
atom smasher. V I

The installation of the new 18-million electron volt ma-
chine will enable University physicists to expand the scope
of their research. Through the atom smasher, then, the
city’s master plan to make Oakland both a natural science
and health science center could be more easily fulﬁlled.

But above the prestige that federal recognition lends
the area, is the opportunity which the grant has presented
the University and its personnel. The scientiﬁc contribu-
tions which could come from the small buff-brick building
between Old Mellon Institute and the parking garage could
be some of the most important ever made by the University.

The investigation of nuclear energy explores the basic
structure known to man. Further work in this ﬁeld could
very well lead to discoveries as signiﬁcant as the concept
of the atom itself.

When such possibilties are considered, the implica-
tions of the grant far outweigh any immediate honors pres-
ent. The advantages presentation of the atom smasher offers

to students, faculty, or the University are only secondary I

in the total situation. Through its grant, the University has

been given the opportunity to contribute to the world- be-_

yond its academic sphere.

German Universities

By Jurgen Schafer

What are the universities in Germany like? I

was asked the other day. Are there freshmen? --

No, there are not. Are there colleges? -—- No, there

are none. Do you have reading assignments? -
No, we do not. Have you many papers to write? —-
No, we have not. Are there tri-

mestral examinations? -—- No, ’
none at all. Do you have a sort.
of grading system? -- No, wef

your dormitory? —— Oh yes, w
do. Are there any alcohol regu-i
lations on campus? —-—‘ No, cer
tainly not. It all begins to sound,
like great fun to study at a Ger- :
man university, however such is 
not the case.

In ‘the imagination of the
poor American freshmen, nearly choking in the
thick, unwonted air of rigid academic discipline,
there rises the picture of Alt—Heidelburg. A snug
small town of picturesque small houses, dating back
to at least the 17th century, a Renaissance tow.n-
hall with a cobblestone market—place in front,
crowded by dapper young fellows wearing student
caps, on their cheeks the scars of their duels, walk-
ing leisurely to one lecture, say from 11 to 12 noon,
after having had their morning beer_. In the after-
noon our student is having a canoe-ride with his
sweetheart, in the evening attending either a
fashionable dance or engaging in a drinking bout
in his fraternity, singing until early morning.

Most of the old German towns have severely
suffered from the last war. They have been par-
tially rebuilt in the old style, but since the uni-
versities are not museums, most of their new build-
ings represent the modern effective bee-hive con-
struction of concrete, glass, and steel. Most of the
research laboratories and university clinics are
equipped according to the latest standards. But,
though the construction is feverish at all the Ger-
man universities, it cannot cope with the one out-
standing problem grimly facing both the organiza-
tion and the underlying idea, the training of an
elite of the German university. This problem is

 

.worsened by the steadily and rapidly increasing

number of students, which has doubled and tripled
since pre-war days. The latest numbers are ap-
proximately 25,000 students in Munich, 14,000 in
Cologne, 11,000 in Munater to name some of the
largest. This means theseniors and the graduate
students, as the American freshmen to junior level,
are still included in the “gymnasium,” which a stu-

  
  
 
 

    

dent normally leaves at the age of 19. Those num-
bers mean that one professor sometimes lectures to
as many as 1,000 or more students, and a class of
100 to 200 students is considered normal, if not
small.

Nof Augmented

Since the professorships have not been aug-
mented in any considerable degree, personal at-
tachment for a professor and respect for hls.1-epu—
tation has always been a greater factor in electing
courses there than in the U. S. But with the in-
creasing number of students, many of them are
happy enough to have at least one interview with
their professor just before their final ‘examination.

The German student is less guided and to a
large extent free to pick and choose those subjects
and lectures he likes or thinks appropriate. Un-
fortunately, this results only too often in confusion
and bewilderment, especially at the beginning. as
there is no advisory or tutoring system to help him.
His serene academic life is not disturbed by papers,
tests and other diverting challenges, but it is nor-
mally overshadowed by one big (mostly ﬁnal) ex-
amination. Competition. is keen and the standards
are high, and one may well. find after four, ﬁve,
six or even more years of study that his Alma
Mater has not been impressed with the quality of
his work and that no degree will be granted.

It is much easier to make generalizations about
German universities since all are state supported.‘
Consequently, there is no problem of, fund raising,
and the fees to be paid are nominal by American
standards. Yet the cost of living is high, especially
since a shortage of housing for the students has
made the rent enormously high.

Lots of Work

But in spite of the fact that a student’s life

means a lot of work in Germany and success is

often doubtful, you may still enjoy it. There are C I

ﬁve months of vacation each year (March-April
and August-October) and the remaining seven
months are pleasantly interrupted by more vaca-
tions and holidays.

Many of the university towns are famous for

the.ir cozy or arty student bars (where one needs 

no ID card) and some of them have retained at
bit of their medieval flavor. The scenery of some
of the middle-sized universities as Tubiugen, Frei-
burg or Marburg is just idyllic, but if you are more
interested in true metropolitan life you may go to
Hamburg, Berlin, Munich or Frankfurt. There is
much here that is beautiful and worth seeing which
cannot be adequately described, an academic life
Very different from the American.

Student Cov't. View

Editor, The Pitt News,
I think I should make very

clear the context of/my remarks
at last Monday’s meeting of the
Student Government Senate, as
reported in your issue of No-
vember 22. Your reporter was
essentially accurate in his quota-
tions but I am ‘concerned that
the context be clearly establish-
ed. My concern was with the
present organization of Student
Government and the difficulty in
carrying out the basic functions
of any governing group under
such a complex structure.

The leadership and the mem-
bership of the Senate, while in-
dividually competent and sin-
cerely interested in the welfare
of the student body, cannot ad-
dress themselves to the real
needs of our own students be-
cause of the intricacies of the
organization. Rather than spend
an inordinate amount of time on
ﬁlling the Senatepositions and
receiving reports from commit-
tees of the executive and judicial
branches, I suggested either dis-
solution or immediate attention
to a new organization to replace
the present.

My comments relating to a
trimester-oriented work—s t u d y
program, campus religious life,
and library hours were all dis-

cussed at previous Senate meet-
ings, as were various schemes
for reorganization, but all seem-

ed likely to be forgotten in
continuing attempts to make the
present Student Government
structure “work.”»

I pointed out that administra-
tive officers, like students and
faculty, sometimes get so in-
volved in programming for both
the present and the future as to
unintentionally neglect ’ s o m e
very present student needs.

If the Student Government
group fails to focus student
opinion, to act effectively as a
liaison between the total stu-
dent body and the administra-
tion, it is neglecting its most
basiofunction. The absence of
a University-sponsored program
in religion, the need for a work-
Study pmgram in ‘cooperation
with industry, a request for
longer library hours on week-
days -—- these were simply ex-
amples of concerns raised by
students and previously discuss-
ed by the Senate which I feared
would drop out of sight in our
struggle with “system” rather
than “function.”

Although I am quite frankly,
“disappointed” and a little “dis—
couraged” with the accomplish-
ments of Student Government
this fall, I want to assure the
Senate of my continued interest
and support regardless of its de-
cision on reorganization. I

hope that The Pitt News will‘
support us in our earnest at-
tempt to more effectively present
student opinion to a most re-
ceptive and interested admin-
istration.

Drinking in Stadium
Decriecl By Students

Editor, The Pitt News,

With all the talk of making a
wet campus out of our already
wet campus, I would like to say,
what I think of drinking our
campus. Drinking is disgusting.
Especially is this so at football
games, where the bottle holders
become so tipsy that clothes of
innocents get ruined. Many
times after the tipsy stages the
group of drinkers become so
rowdy that ﬁghts start and the
participants make fools of them-
selves. This was the case at the
USC game when a ﬁght broke _
out behind me, and ‘before I
knew it the boxers were rolling
down the bleachers on top of my
friends and I, sending one of my

>-

‘ friends to the hospital and bruis-

ing a few others. The person 
sent to the hospital happened to ’
be an alum and I was very em-
barrassed that this was the best
foot that present University
scholars could put form,

Engineer Says ‘News"
Lacks Taste, Fair Play

Editor, The Pitt News,

Your notice in Letters to the
Editor stating that “letters con-
taining misst"*~'-vments or lacking
in good taste and fair play will
be rejected” makes mc wonder
why you don’t apply the same
policy to the contents of The
Pitt. News.

Jim O’Brien’s
ments on “Upsala
fraternity spirit at the Home-
coming. dance are not a symbol

caustic com-

Downsala”

of good taste and fair play.
Perhaps he should applaud
them instead for three weeks of

intense’ work which resulted in
a winning display which excel-
lently represented him and his
University to his city. Or does
he consider The Pitt News as
just a symbol by which he can
express his inane opinions? If he
is to criticize such a construc-
tive school spirit, then all he
does is condemn himself.

iThe second example of this
same trend is your editorial
“Teeters Totters.” In light of
Pat Teeters’ record on this cam-
pus, you have completely run
afoul of any system of good
taste by criticizing her resigna-
tion. It seems that people of
ability are always harped at by
the mediocre majority when they
refuse to continue to carry the
load for them.

Your attitudes seem to place
you at the head of, this latter
group. Be eternally grateful that
she and a few others helped the
rest of the inadequates on this
campus; at least for a little
While.

Pat Teeters Defended
By SU Board Member

Editor, The Pitt News,

' The editorial, “Teeters Tot-
ters” in the Monday, November
20 issue of The Pitt News may
have contributed the ﬁnal blow
to the demise of one of the most
outstanding and capable students
at the University of Pittsburgh.

I have felt ‘very fortunate in

being able to work with Miss '

Teeters in the last few months
as she attempted, for the ﬁrst
time in the recent history of gov-
ernmental affairs, to inject some
meaningful thought and action
into this area.

It had seemed that there was
some hope for a “come-uppance"
from the usual bickering about
points of procedure, Us and
Alcohol, etc., to a higher level of

. students participating in Univer-

sity life.

Pat’s endeavors to interest,
pompous elected groups to make
some contribution to the long-
neglected area concerning our
fellow international students was
met with suchtremarks as “Why
should we do SG’s dirty work?”

Why for that matter should
any undergraduate do the “dirty
work" that governmental or-
ganizations usually require? It
has seemed to me of late that
all of our so-deemed student
leaders have been keeping their
minds in some insulated dome
known as status, or should I call
it “statusitus‘?”

Pat has never been afflicted
with this common college poli-
tical cold, which may explain
her discouragement.

Contrary to the editorial, Pat

has given SG value and direc-
tion, but not the common afflic-
tion. She has had the courage to
remain herself, and in doing so,
she has made no statement to
“those students who elected her
last spring.” ,

I think that Miss Teeters has

A. too much respect for those stu-

dents to point out the .obvious---
that maturity and constructive
positive action do not revolve
around the concepts of “involv-
edness” or “Bobby’s Bright Bits
of Bull.” - -s...

Rather maturity or the devel- .

opment of such means maintain-
ing a proper balance between
the worthwhile and the worth-
less, the worthless being. the ex-
isting state of adolescent gov-
ernmental activities on this cam-
pus.

No, I really don't think that
Miss Teeters wanted to be an-
other Joan of Arc or Patricia of
Pitt. Here is one lone voice say-
ing. for what it’s worth,‘ “You
have my respect,‘ Pat.” And
wouldn't you agree, Eclitor of
Th.é'Piti N ems?

Penn State Co-Ed Hits
O'Brien As ‘Unethical’
Editor, The Pitt News,

At the present time I am a
student at the Pennsylvania
State
having obtained a few issues of
the so—called “student" news-
paper, The .Pitt News, I was
greatly honored to read a few
articles writtei. by Jim O’Brien,
Sports Editor.

The speciﬁc articles to which
I am referring are the ones in
which Mr. O’Brien blamed cer-
tain Panthers for losing a recent
football game. In "my humble

University. Last week,

opinion these Panthers should ‘

feel honored as each must be a.
one-man team. _

The purpose of this letter is

not to. uphold the honor of in-
dividual Panthers, but to investi-
gate the lack of professional
ethics which _is evident in Mr.
O’Brien’s writing. Is it necessary
to delve intm a person’s an-
cestry,--andi mannerisms to meet
a deadline? Or is it simply that
John Michelosen needs a scape-
goat in order to justify his los-
ing season? '
A Being somewhat familiar with
the policies of the Pennsylvania
State University on such matters
as these, I am sure Rip Engle
would have defended his players
and not let this kind of article
continue.

In reference to the remarks
concerning Mike Ditka, does Mr.
O’Brien claim to be psychic in
that he can predict the actions
of another individual in a cer-
tain situation?

We here at the Pennsylvania
State University are taught to
realize that teamwork is impor-
tant, that one man’s action can-
not win or lose a football game.

Poor Chapel Attendance .

Questioned By Student

Editor, The Pitt News,

One of the most important
parts of a student's life should
.be,lin my opinion, religion. On
our campus we are fortunate to
have"a beautiful chapel, a world-

famous cl air and inspirational
ministers - all of which are
available to the students every
Tuesday afternoon, at noon.

Due either to lack, of interest
or lack of publicity, the Tues-
day services are attended by a
very small number of students.
I would hate to think that those
people who attend the services
are the only students to whom
religion means something on this
campus.

mustered up enough courage to ask her the all-important
question: “Will you Wear my 4-H pin?” ‘

“Yes,” she said simply. They shook hands then and squeezed

eyes were a triﬂe moist, who can blame them?

For a timethings went swimmingly. Then a. cloud appeared.
Mary Ellen, 11; seems, was a. rich girl and accustomed to costly

Health Center Dedicated to Alan Magee Scaife

Scaife Planning Aids Medical Research

Less than two years ago, ap-
proximately 300 guests met at
a special dinner to dedicate
the new Health Professions
Center to the memory of the

man who planning and dedi-

cation helped to make it possible,
Alan Magee Scaife.

The guests, consisting of mem-
bers of the Board of Trustees of
the University, six major Pitts-
burgh hospitals, and representa-
tives from other leading Pitts-
burgh civic and industrial con-
cerns, heard Chancellor Edward
H. Litchﬁeld, Dr. E. R. McClusky,
vice chancellor of the Health Pro-
fessions. Gwilym A. Price, chair-
man of the Board of Trustees of
the University and Leon Falk, Jr.
chairman of the University Devel-
opment Committee, speak of
Sc-ail’e’s accomplishments. _

Helped Raise Millions

They reviewed his
planning and development of the
Health Center, his leadership in
the 1952-1954 campaign which
raised the 19 million dollars for
the construction of. the Health
Professions Building, and the
other ways in which Scaife served
t:he University from 1949 until his
deth in 1958. _

Price called Scaife one of “the
leaders of a beneﬁcient revolu-
tion such as the world had not
seen before . . . He understood
that we need not return to the
l930’s. He knew that we could
advance far beyond the econ-
omic gains made during the war.

“And he was convinced that this
could best be done by Americans
working for themselves, among

V themselves, in their own commu-

nities, with theirown means.”

According to P r i c e, “Scaife
helped to initiate the planning of
our (Pittsburgrrs Renaissance. He
provided leadership—-the prime
requisite for getting something
started and finished.

Loved Pittsburgh

“He had,” continued Price, “two
strong convictions about the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. He believed,
ﬁrst, that it could and should be-
come one of the really great uni-
versities of the world. To this end
he devoted himself with a striking
intensity of purpose.

100‘/0 Student Increase

The University’s program of in-
formal courses for adults has ex-
perienced a 100 per centlincrease
in enrollment over the fall term
of 1960, and a 500 per cent in-
crease over the fall of 1959 when
the school first began.

The Universit:y’s Evening Oliice
announced today that 918 persons
will complete the 19 courses this
term. This number compares with

» 1960’s 433 persons and .l959’s 152.

Among those attending the cur-
rent classes are 27 persons over
65 years at‘ age who are required
to pay only three dollars per
course. Sixty—six persons are en-
rolled at specially reduced rates
for married couples.

Studies show that the most
popular course is “Speed Read-
ing” which is taught by Thomas
Leiper. supervisor and teacher
of reading at Mt. Lebanon High
School. Over 1289 students are
presently enrolled in the ﬁve
sections devoted to the course.

The Evening Office reports that
the demand for “Speed Reading”
is such that it has already been
necessary to limit enrollment for
a similar course which will be
offered during the Winter term.

The area of business ranks sec-
ond in enrollment ﬁgures. “In-
vestments—-Wise and‘ Otherwise”
has been attended by 113 per-
sons. The course, which will be
given again this winter, is taught
by Leroy A. Shattuck, Jr., pro-

Twelve colleges and universities
including the University will su-

determine the physical fitness
tit’ )'oung‘ people between the ages

l0 and 17.

The tests, to be given three
times, at six week .intervals, were
prepared by the President’s Coun-
cil on Youth Fitness.

There will be seven areas to
determine students’ strength and
ability. including average number
ct’ push—ups or pull-ups within a
speciticcl time interval; average
ctlistance in a standing broad jump;
and the average time for the 50

Vvatclicd for Gains

M l"

instructors in the schools will
give the tests and determine
“:'x‘L‘lhel' the studcnt’s physical

abilities have improved during the
intervals between each of the
three testing periods.

Chairman of the physical ed-
ucation department of the Uni-
versity, Dr. Karl Oermann, is
chairman of the pilot study for
the tri-state area. He also
served as conference co-ordi-
nator in 1958 when Pennsylva-
nia ran a similar study.

The current study is a response

to a request by President Kennedy '

that schools and colleges in the
"US. renew their efforts to
strengthen the physical ﬁtness of
this country’s youth.
Study Under Way

Last July, the President said

that, “Although today’s young peo-

ple are l‘undamen.tall‘y healthieri

than the youth of any previous
generation, the .majority have not
developed strong, agile» bodies.
The softening process of our civ-
ilization continues to. carry on its
persistent erosion.” A
Two of the schoolsunder the

U-nivcrsity’s supervision have
already begun the extensive
-tests.

Both Wilkinsburg and North

Hills high schools are working to
complete the series of physical
ﬁtness tests. In the near future,
other area schools will be invited
by the University toparticipate in
the pilot study.

All of the,statistics gathered

from the University and the other’

11 areas will be processed by the
State College Physical Fitness
Center and the Pennsylvania De-
partment of Public Instruction.
After processing, the data will pe
sent to the President’s Council on
Youth Fitness.

Plans call for state-wide
nation wide program to be

Business Grad Council

To Include

Executives

The advisory council for the University’s new Graduate
School of Business will include 21 top executives from major
U.S. industrial, commercial, and financial firms, announced
Dr. Marshall A. Robinson, dean of the school.

The executives represent corporations in the ﬁelds of
banking, merchandising, power, electrical equipment and ap-

pliances, investment,
and glass, transportation, auto
manufcaturers, metals, and oil.

The Graduate School of Busi-
ness was formed when the former
undergraduate School of Business
and the Graduate School of Re-
tailing merged this fall.

Leads to Master's

It offers a course leading to a
master's degree in business, as
well as a doctoral program.

All qualiﬁed candidates with

a. bachelors degree in liberal

arts, the sciences, engineering,
or business may enroll in the
school, which represents a move
away from undergraduate spe-
cialization in business at the

University.

According to Dr. Robinson, the
21.‘ member advisory council will
“provide a continuing link to in-
dustry in this area, and will help
focus research activities and edu-
cational programs on the present
and long-term needs of the busi-
ness community.”

Links Business

“We are fortunate in having on
this panel men who are ‘deeply
convinced of the necessity of ad-
vanced education for business-
men. With their cooperation, we
expect the Graduate School of
Business to make major strides in
the improvement of management
training and academic research
for the pressing business problems
of our time," he said.

Chairman of the advisory
council is Avery C. Adams,
chairman of the board of Jones
and Laughlin Steel Corp.

Members are Frank E. Agnew,
Jr., president of Pittsburgh Na-
tional Bank; Buckley M. Byers,
president of A. M. Byers Co.; M.
A. Cancelliere, president of West-
ern Pennsylvania National Bank;
Streuby L. Drumm, president of

B y Upperclassmcn
. By JIl\'I O’BI{IEN
All that is left in the wake
of the disastrous football sea-

an epitaph. These are the
times‘ that try men’s "souls,
someone once said. The Pan-

ther football players today must
feel like survivors of an atomic
bomb tall-out, stepping forth from
a bomb shelter.

“What is‘ there to do now?”
They must surely ask themselves.
All there is to do is get some long,
lost sleep and try to rid the mem-
ories of the seven defeats, and
dwell contentedly on the three
wins.

For a dozen of the players, they
probably drew a deep sigh of re-
lief after the Penn State game;
For once there would not be the
foreboding thought of having to
practice every night the next
week, sweating and toiling on the
field till dark.

End "of Road

The Penn State finale marked[
the end of college careers for 123
Panthers and they should not
graduate without some mention.
Foremost was Fred Cox, the burly
halfback who was the most valu-
able player on the team, and
kicked his way to glory this year.

Larry Vignali was chosen on
a second team All-American se-
lection recently. Larry is mar-
ried, has a handsome baby boy
and is in the Dental School.
Vignali has been a standout at
guard for three years.

Vignali‘s pal, Rege Coustillac,
survived a siege of injuries which
plagued him throughout his ca-

reer, but he was always there to
make the big stop, t'rom his cen-
ter linebacker position.
C-Boys Go

Cox wasn’t the only C-Boy.
There was Bob Clemens who only
played in one game this year at
peak shape. His loss to the team
this season was devastating. Last
year he led the team in rushing;

their season Saturday when they
travel to Johnstown to engage
Johnstown Center College.

Leading the attack for the Cubs
this year is Terry Holder, former
ace for Fort Cherry High, who
sparked them to the State Class
B Championship last year.

Other scholarship players are
Tom Roantree, who starred for
Wilkinsburg in his high school

days, Belle Ve1'non’s Daryl Ruby,
Bill Mclntryre of Beaver and Bob
Richardson, who hails from New
Jersey.
Peabody Player Starts

The probable
against Johnstown will be Holder,
Roantree, Mclntyre, Ruby and
Brian Fisher, a scrappy
backcourt ace from Pittsburgh’s
Peabody High. .

Because it is the first game
of the season, Coach Carl Peter-

second unit extensively. This
team will probably be composed
of ‘Richardson. Barry Wetzel,
Andy Alex, Ron Supransic, and
Carl Rizzo.

Inspired News Hawks

Beat Daily

Col legians

By HIRAM SHMEDLEY _

For a while last Saturday it looked as though the Cow-
ards of the Penn State Daily Collegians would chalk up their
fourth win in a row over the Pitt News Hawks. However, the
Hawks were not to be denied and fought back from two de-
ﬁcits to cop a 13-12 win at Schenley Oval.

After the Cowards took the opening kickoff,

ily marched downﬁeld as John.
Black tossed three

(Methuselah)
yards to Ray (True Coward) But-
ka, for the score.

The sensational passing combo
of Jim “Juggernaut” O’Brien to
Pete “The Russian” Bochonak led
to the Hawks’ initial score.
the bloodthirsty Coward line bear-
ing down on "Juggernaut” he
calmly spotted his teammate on
the 22 yard line and “The Rus-
sian” sped into the end zone for
a 57 yard score.

With the score tied 6-6 Black
hit John “The Bomb” Beague
with a 42 yard touchdown heave.
Once again the Cowards failed to
convert.

Bochonak thrilled the crowd,

With

they stead-

by taking the second half kick-
off and racing 61 yards for the
tying tally. On an option play
O’Brien hit Steve “Bulldog”
Beloﬁ with a pass for the extra
point to clinch the win.

Another standout for the Hawks
was Art “Big Daddy” Fleischner
who was “Juggernaut’s” favorite
target when short first down yard-
age was needed.

One player who deserves men-
tion is Barry “Chicken” Cross
who handled the safety position
for the Hawks. “Chicken” who
was run over by his own team-
mate early in the game intercept-
ed a pass tovstop a fourth quarter
Coward drive.

 

 

Grapplers Count on Sophbmores to Handle

Upper Weiglit Classes For 1962 Campaign

The 1962 version of the Panther
wrestling team could shape up to
be one of the finest in Rex Peery’s
eleven year tenure at Pitt.

The big question mark for the
grapplers is the sophomore crop,
which has showed up quite well
thus far, but has yet to face the
true test of
match competi-
tion. If the
grapplers are to
be a strong unit
it will be up to
the newcomers
to win in the
u p p er weight
classes, where
the squad was p
woefully weak “  '
last year. RICH MARTIN

The squad’s tentative starting
lineup would have four sopho-
mores in it. Tim Gay, who has
the inside track on the 157 pound
class, although he is being pressed
by Augie Arrigone and Paul Wil-
son, Ken Barr, Tom Jeffries, and
Jeff Ware or John Telesky, are
all sophomores who should be
starting. A

Panther/s To Use

Hank Luisetti, the author of the

ford who says that “racehorse
basketball stinks,” would scorn
the play of the 1961-62 basketball
team if they hold trueito form.
“We're going to speed up our at-
tack,” says Coach Bob Timmons.
“We’1l be using’ two clubs in or-
der to keep. a fresh five on the

Still, Timons’ thinking
parallel to Chancellor Edward H.
Litchﬁeldi's expansion talk. “This
will be a building year,” the ami-
able mentor reasons. Ready to
initiate his ninth year at the helm,
Timmons will be depending a
great deal on-an influx of un-
proven sophomores. .

The biggest losses from last
year’s quintet which compiled
a 12-11 record are John Frid-

NICE GUYS FINISH LAST

It was Leo “The Lip” Durocher, one-time manager of

the New York Giants’ baseball team, who uttered the im-

mortal words above. The theory has been disproved several

times, of course, bu.t it merits thought when one scrutinizes
,,..t.he athletic situation at Pitt.

The Pitt football team has just tacked up a 3-7 mark
for the second-guessers, alumni, and experts to take pot-
shots at all winter. If anyone argues what might have been,
toss the 10-9 squeaker over Sout.hern California and the 10-7
Miami win in their faces. We should’ve lost both.

Then we would be 1-9 and the food for thought would
be mighty tangy. Inevitably the public is going to hypo their
“get rid of the coach” hymn to a startling crescendo. Coach
John Michelosen is the object of public scorn once again.
Numerous Virtues

Everyone I meet in t.he street chastises me for not blast-
ing Michelosen. I end up extolling the virtues of the man,
paraphrasing Grantland R.ice’s immortal lines about “how you
play the game” and other such hogwash, but always back-

» . ing against the wal.l as the debate heatens.

The reason that I could never stick the needle into
Miphelosen is because I know the man; they know the coach
as the scoreboard portrays him. I know that Michelosen is
the swellest fella you’ll ever come across. He’s your friend
it’ there ever was one.

The same holds true in the athletic department.
Everybody is a nice guy. “And the trouble with athletic
director Frank Carver,” all his employees sayeth at vari-
ous times, “is that he’s too damn nice.”

_ The coaching fraternity at Pitt ranks with the “ten most
gregarious guys in town.” They all have Pepsodent smiles.
friendly greetings, and heartwarming personalities. The list
is massacred when you ask for a winning record in their in-
dividual sports. VVe still go on losing to smaller schools who

,._i give no athletic aid, “but have everything to gain by beating
a big school like Pitt."
No Pride

We have nothing to do but swallow our pride, and appar-
ently some athletes lack. pride. “The only thing that keeps
this football team from being a great one,” All-American
“Biggie” Goldberg has said, “is the personal pride in win-
ning.”

And winning is important! “If we are not going to em-
phasize winning. what shall we emphasize?” Fritz Chrisler,
the University of Michigan’s director of athletics. said at a
dinner last year, “Shall we emphasize losing --- the other al-
ternative?" .

“America didn’t become a great country by losing,
either in athletics or in the world of commerce. And it’s

not very comforting to come in second in a war.” ’

Sure, winning isn’t the only yardstick by which to meas-
ure 3 coaclfs ability, but at least he should be expected to
win.

At every other school in the country, including the puri-
tan Ivy League, a coach must produce. At Pitt no coach has
to produce. The atmosphere must spread to the athletes.
They must be indoctrinated into the laissez-faire school of *
thinking. “After all,” they can ask, “who cares?”

Too many recruits get a scholarship in hand, and figure,
‘.l‘l‘vIy loaﬁng days have just begun.” They're not pressured;
their schblarships aren’t in danger. Everyone else has to
produce. Why not the athletes? If I don’t get a 2.75 or better
(QPA) I lose my scholarship. A 2.75 in other words means
that I won the game of grade getting.

Pitt. is a school where one more-win than losses con-
stitutes a winning season. We emphasize mediocrity.

There's actually more
rich-flavor leaf in L&M
than even in some un-
