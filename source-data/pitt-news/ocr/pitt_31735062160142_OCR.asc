Three Slates Appeal

For Voters’ Favor

,Three slates, three platforms, and the usual
keep-it-under-your-hat atmosphere are pushing
new life into this year's student elections. A

Interfraternity Council became the latest group
to enter the slate-making business on Wednesday
night. The ﬁnished product was named the IF—-
Integrity F'oremost—Slate.

This IF Slate will battle in the elections next-
Wednesday against two others, the Merit Party and
the Good Humor Slate. ~ ‘

Incumbent Congressman Larry Adler—-backed A

by the Merit Party in Wednesday’s_election—deliv-
ered 21 blast at Interfraternity Council early vWed-
nesday in a statement to the News.

He said, “IF had a list of approved candidates
before any other students or groups did . . .”

lAdler further said that “for the ﬁrst time in a
few years the ofﬁcers of IF Council have shown
themselves to be politically swayed for personal
gain,” and that "‘there is no need for an IF Slate
this year.”

The three slates show a -mixtureof fraternity
men and independents and each support strong can-
didates.

The Merit and Good Humor slates both boast
several strong fraternity and independent candi-

Play Roles Climax

By GENE WEINSTEIN

When Pitt Player curtain
time rolls around the begin-
ning of .May for Thornton
Wilder’s “Our Town,” Pitt
students will see Bob Gard-
ner and Cyril Wecht, taking
their last bows. The two poli-I
ticians-turned-thespians will
be ending their collegiate activi-
ties careers closely associated, as
usual.

Wecht has the lead role, that of
the easy going stage manager,
while Gardnerportrays the editor
of the town paper, Mr.7Webb~.

" Two of the biggest of the
BMOC, Wecht and Gardner
have gone through much of
l’itt’sl hectic activities mill to-

« gether. Neither has fared too
poorly. ,

Top;man in Student Congress is
president Cyril Wecht, while co-
player Bob Gardner sits in the
.vice-president’s chair. In Men’s
Debate, the positions are reversed.
The, Congress veep is Debate’s
commander-in-chief, while prexy
Wecht serves as assistant manager,
second in the line of command. g

Gardner also acted as President
of the state debater’s, convention
this year.

. , Top IM Men
The two actors have long been

order in Inter—fraternity Council.
Both have been presidents of their
respective fraternities. Wecht is a
Phi Ep, while Gardner sits in the
Pi Kappa Alpha booth. ~

, There is not space enough to list
~'Wecht’s complete activities log,
but, among other things, he is bus-
iness manager of Players. Gard-
ner. has appeared in past Players’
performances last summer.

, Out of Character .
Gardner’s role in this produc-
tion, that of» the editor, doessat ﬁrst
glance seem to place him out of
character. Those familiar with the
tall po1itico’s, record recall the
stinging criticism he directed at
the News for conducting a “witch-
hunt” against the Food Service.
lWecht, too has long been a
stormy ﬁgure on the eighth floor. "
Loungers in the DOM lounge oc-
casionally hear one of the now
famous Wechtisms, “I’ll break you,
Reese,” complete with gestures.
The term is a ﬁgurative one, of
‘course.
Careers Finished
. With the Players’ production
near the end of the semester, the
thespians will be winding up their
affairs on campus. Wecht plans to
go to medical school, while Gard-
ner intends to enter the employee
relations ﬁeld. Their acting days
will be over when scarcely begun,
but the two are glad they are clos-
'ing their careers with “Our Town.”

Na Political Clubs «

. The_ University’s committee on recognitions has decided
, that this campus is no place for political clubs. They did not
3 say there was anything wrong with engaging in political
"activity off-campus, so it seems safe to assume that we“ can
mouni as many soapboxes as we- wish just as long as they
are not set up here." - ‘
’ The ,committee’s decision came Monday after they had
heard the spokesmen for two of the proposed clubs outline .
their plans. Their action effectively closes thedoor on legal-
ized politigal activity on campus during this important elec-
tion year. Any diehard student politicians who continue to “
organize groups in favor of this or that candidate will

henceforth be engaged in subversive activity. a
A  xx: ‘ :1: =3:

_

Apparently the ”committee was not influenced by the
long list of other schools, both state—supported»and’ private‘,
which have given the stamp of respectability to political
 _olubs.«Princeton, Yale, Harvard, the University of Califor-

'nia, the ,‘University of North Carolina, the University of
Michigarr and Penn State among the leading schools‘ have
either tolerated“-political clubs for many years or have re-
 centlyigranted them recognition. , ,~
 ~ The ‘committee imaintained that the clubs would be
‘only transitory, that they would be partisan and therefore

rfor“ students to join groups oﬁcampus. No one felt that
ugtory. But, then, so are the major groups off—campus transi-

 tory in that sense. They exist primarily to put people of
 whom they approve into ofﬁceby‘ serving as a standard

, 5" Obviously the clubs would have ‘been partisan but that
this would preclude-serving as a ‘broad educational base
isnot immediately obvious. Pagtisanship initself is not

i distasteful and, infact, is the real basis for political and
commercial activity in this country. It is onlythrough the

 competition of ideas for a place in government that any real
. progress is made... ’ ‘ '

. But lrrrking behindgthe negative decision was the fear
’ that political clubs might endanger. our appropriation from
Harrisburg. Penn State, which is wholly state—supported,

apparently was not too worried about this possibility. ‘
We don’t think that there was even. the slightest chance

political groups. We think that the committee on ‘recogni-
tion was seeing bogey men under its bed.

The political clubs would have brought students closer
to the election than they have ever" been. After all, the
University encourages the student to make Pitt his head-
quarters for the four years that he is here, but now in a

.;very important ﬁeld of activity‘ he is; driven away. A
g ' iWe on The Pitt News have access ‘to student .news-
papers from all parts of the country. In a great many of
the nation’s colleges we know that students are taking a
 large part in the coming election. Here it will pass us by.
 ,  We would like to predict that a great many other things,
‘iincluding new students, will soon be passing us by. The
a committee has made an unwise andold-maidish decision.
A :VVe",hope they will reconsider their action and approve the
clubs. ‘ ‘

A common sight on the 18th floor these days is
seniors, hurrying into Dean Crawf‘ord’s office, hav-

ing their credits checked. To graduate, the class of

’52 must present 120 credits, plus two for gym, or
the ROTC equivalent. .

While the precise number of credits may vary,
this type of system is common throughout the land.
Although the credit system has
its defects, it certainly ‘makes for
easy classiﬁcation.

For each course passed, stu-
dents are “credited” with a cer-

‘Student government is unique among demo-

an election issue. This is no fault of the people

in it, nor of the» administration that advises, it,’

nor of thevoters that elect it; In fact, it is no fault-
at all, but just part of the nature of student gov-

in Where does the blame lie for ‘these educationa

is largely at fault, the credit system. Andthere is 

much to substantiate this viewpoint.

By DON SCHURNIAN

I At the half,-way mark of
spring football drills, Coach
“Red”t Dawson has come to
but one deﬁnite conclusion-—that
he definitely has problems.

His most baffling stumbling
block is inithe quarterback slot
where coinpetition is especially
keen. .. _

“Of course, it’s still a little too
earlyto sayranything deﬁnite,” t-he
ex-lV,lSC mentor concedes.

But, with Dawson’s budding

seems to be stale-mated between
two “and a half contenders.

Henry Ford, who was expected
to, be a strong dontender, under-

mainder of spring drills.
Ford played solely on defense
last year, but Coach Dawson in
making a distant observation says,
“Ford may have to play on both
defense and offense this year.”

take the mound against til! Titans

Apr. 3. .

Two games with Ohio Univer-

‘squad. has been practicing reg-

ularly at Schenley Oval. And up
to now the rookies have been the
most impressive. C

“The most encouraging thing
about this squad is the number

He could point out,
where Napoleon had

Years’ War could have been stymied in twenty
Minutes, if he had only been consulted.

He didn’t, ‘however, know Women. As he-
demonstrated by forgetting his girl's Birth-
day. She, naturally, was Incensed. Sent him
a chilly letter canceling their date for the

‘ Spring Weekend, three Days away, and
announcing that She was 'I'hrough._Forevcr.'

Fortunately, he was a Man of Infinite Re-
source. He waited until Thursday, then
hiked to the Western Union ofﬁce and sent
a telegram’. Very casual . . . to wit: “-Sorry
you can’: make Weekend. Under circum-
stances, am dating Eloise Witherspoon. You
may have seen her Picture when she was
