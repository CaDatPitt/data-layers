“I ’m quite happy to turn
the board over to someone
as responsible as ilim. He
will do a good job. ”

—— Luke Kluchko

1985 SGB president.

“I’m quite happy to turn the board
over to someone as responsible as Jim.
He will do a good job," Kluchko said.

Mumma defeated Dan Taylor with
a landside victory in the race for the
office of SGB president. He received
,l.5ll votes to Taylor’s 810. the largest
margin of victory for an SGB president
in four years.

“The inaugural ceremony is a great
way to end the campaign. Its a fair
start for the new board members. It’s
also a fairwell for the old board
members," said Mary Helen Teeter,

an elections committee member.
"The 1985 board members deserve
this. They did a lot of hard work.“ said

Chuck Quinlan. assistant chairman of

the Student Relations Committee.

The board and committee members
attended the inaugural ceremony last
night in the student union Ball Room.
The event was organized by the elec-
tion committee. headed by Linda Bod-
nar. ‘‘I’m very pleased with the ban-
quet.“ she said.

Members ofthe university’s faculty
and administration. including Vice
President of Student Affairs Conney
M. Kimbo and Pitt President Wesley
Posvar were present.

"I always have the highest expecta-
tions for SGB. It is an outstanding
organization and a vital part of our
university.” Posvar commented. '

Kimbo offered several suggestions
for the new board during his welcome
address.

vHe urged students to pursue their
ideas. to be serious about their leader-
ship and to work as a team. “Become
a model for other students to follow."
Kimbo said. 9

“Use the system. When the system
doesn’t work, put time and effort into
changing the system. If you need our
help or advice. seek it.” the vice presi-
dent of Student Affairs continued.

In his farewell address. Kluchko
recognized the 1985 committee
Chairpersons. “It has been a very
challenging year. We pledged to base
our decisions on research and fact. We

Waiting  and waiting 

Once again, students are faced with waiting in lines — very
long lines. First they must register for classes, then they must
pay their tuition. All of these require patience and supportive
shoes. Lastly, of course, students have to buy their books at
Pitt’s book store (above). Well, why not? What’s one more line?

did disagree but we acted as a unit,”
he said. “We have learned not only to
appreciate our rights and privileges but
those of others too.”

“We are nine people faced with the
challenge of representing 20.000. Our
success depends greatly on how well
we are able to recognize the concerns

. of the student population. However, it"

is one thing to realize what problems

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

exist. but it is another to be able to
solve them". said Mumma in his ad-
dress to the new student government
board.

“Whether or not we accomplish our
most important goals will be the test of
‘our term. With a sincere desire for im-
provement. quality decision making
and an emphasis on group effort. we
have a strong basis for success."

Pitt’s Women’s Studies urges reform

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh should
attempt to eliminate sex—based inequi-
ties in faculty salaries and increase the
number of women in administrative
and tenured positions during the next
year, according to a review of the Pro-
vost’s Planning Document.

The view is entitled “A Women’s
Agenda for the University of Pitts-
burgh.” and was prepared by the Pro-
vost‘s Advisory Committee on
Women’s Concerns.

The study stated there are no women
among the top administrative positions

and in some areas there are either no
or few tenured women.

The report also stated, “Sex-based
inequities in faculty salaries will be
eliminated; and a ﬂexible fringe beneﬁt
package that provides options reflect-
ing employees’ multiple roles.
lifestyles and life-stages [should be im-
plemented]. " g

The Provost's Advisory Committee
on Women’s Concerns recommended
that the university provide an instruc-
tional budget to aid in new course
development for the Women’s Studies
Program and “instructional backing to
pursue external funding.”

The study also recommended new
job security and career opportunities
for female support staff. It said the
university should improve its classifica-
tion system to recognize the executive
functions of many staff positions. The
advisory committee is urging Pitt to
develop a “centrally administered
salary pool to provide the financial
resources for staff displaced through
re—allocation and cutbacks and to
enhance upward mobility through
transfer or promotion.”

The study also advised Pitt’s ad-
ministration to develop an affirmative
action program for women vendors.

Public education faces potential cuts

Public education will be facing a new
fiscal crisis in 1986 as the nation’s

*~ schools prepare to grapple with a

potential wave of federal cuts that
threaten to throttle the education refomi
movement and exacerbate a myriad of
other school problems. said the Na-
tional Education Association.

“Many states have begun the first
steps to improve the quality of their
schools. but now they will likely be
burdened with devastating cuts to
balance the federal budget over the next
five years." explained National Educa-
tion Association President Mary Hat-
wood Futrell, in assessing the nation’s
education picture on the eve of a new
year. ‘

Futrell noted that the cuts, triggered
by the recent federal legislation man-
dating a balanced budget by 1991,
would come at a time when schools are
confronted with several major
problems:

0 the recession in the farm states and

its impact on rural schools

0 the effects on schools of the con-
tinuing “Rust Belt" recession in the in-
dustrial states

0 the rising tide of children who live
in poverty

0 the high school dropout and il-
literacy rates

0 the increased rate of drug and
alcohol abuse among youth

0 the upsurge. of single-parent
families

The House Budget Committee
estimated that the spending cuts could
slice education and other domestic pro-
grams by 4.6 percent by March 1, with
deeper cuts —— 30 percent or more -
in 1987 and beyond.

What’s more, Futrell explained,
schools are already feeling the impact
of the farm crisis in America’s
heartland as the cruel combination of
falling land values, slumping prices for
farm products, high interest rates and
declining exports are driving thousands

of families off their land. The resulting
crisis of rural America is reflected in
the exodus of people and businesses
from small towns and a decrease in the
tax base and funding for rural schools.

The crisis of rural America rivals the
continuing plight of older industrial
communities in the “Rust Belt” states
of the Northeast and Midwest, Futrell
said. and could portend what’s in store
for the rest of America.

School districts in agricultural states
are caught in a “pincer movement” of
declining state and local revenues.
Shortfalls in state revenues have
resulted in — or are expected soon to
result in -— across-the—board budget
cuts in Nebraska, Iowa, Idaho, Arkan-
sas. Colorado, Minnesota and
Oklahoma, the education association's
president added.

At the same time, the older industrial
communities in Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Indiana, Illinois and other “Rust Belt”

Khadafy seeks support from allies against U.S. boycott

Libya — According to an aide.
Libya’s Col. Muammar Khadafy
sought the approval of European na-
tions that rejected Reagan‘s economic
boycott at a meeting Wednesday night.
Khadafy told Western diplomats that he
would extradite any terrorists found in
Libya. Yet one diplomat. at the same
meeting. said that Khadafy also warn-
ed that he would “become a madman"
and strike at U.S. warships and military
bases in Europe if the United States
takes any military action against Libya
to retaliate for Libya’s alleged role in
international terrorism. Khadafy again

I denied Reagan's charge that Palestinian

terrorists directed from Libya were
responsible for the Dec. 27 attacks on
airports in Rome and Vienna that left
19 people dead.

NASA readies
shuttle for launch

Florida - - Although NASA made no
promises. engineers at Florida's Ken-
nedy Space Center said they think they
can get the beleaguered shuttle Colum-
bia into orbit today if the weather is
good. Columbia‘s on—again—off-again

mission has been an emotional wringer
for the ships seven—member crew.
Time is rapidly running out to get Col-
umbia into space to prevent schedul-
ing problems. NASA has scrubbed the
launch five times — the latest being
yesterday morning.

Yesterday, technicians found and
removed a five—inch instrument which
had gotten into the fuel line. The
scenario now is for a blastoff this mor-
ning. but weather prospects look
gloomy. Predictions are for a heavy
cloud cover and light rain in the area.

U.S. diplomats
to return from tour

South Africa — Six U.S. Represen-
tatives said they will prove they care
about the plight of South Afriea‘s
blacks when they return from a tour of
a squalid squatters‘ camp outside Cape
Town.

The delegation. led by Democrat
William Gra_\' of Pennsylvania. promis-
ed to tell Americans about the horri-
ble conditions in the shanty town. and
said they will ask for more U.S. aid.

Grey made the pledge in a small.
dusty schoolyard at the squatters‘ camp

at Cape Town. “We care  and we
will demonstrate that when we go
back." he said. ‘

Bobbies ready
for terrorism

LONDON — International terrorism
has brought to Britain an image most
never wanted to see. Police on anti-
terrorist patrols at London‘s Heathrow
Airport began carrying submachine
guns yesterday in the first open. routine
use of the weapons by the traditional-
ly unarmed bobbies.

Member of Parliament Clive Soley
said he's not sure the armed patrols are
the most effective method of deter-
rence. Soley deplored what he called
a “dreadful drift in Britain into an in-
creasingly armed police force."

One British traveler at l‘IC2lllll‘0\\'
commented. “lt certainl_\' spoils the im-
age of the British bobby. And it's get-
ting more and more like America."

But Airport Police Cominander Pat

Carson defended the move. saying if

a terrorist began indiscriminately
shooting passengers. police need to
"get at him quickly and take him out“
to save lives.

Weinberger fights
budget cuts

WASHINGTON —— Defense
Secretary Weinberger used the issue of
Soviet nuclear missiles as ammunition
in his ﬁght to block budget cuts for the
Pentagon yesterday.

Hoping to keep military spending in-
creases intact at three percent.
Weinberger charged that Moscow has
deployed 45 SS—25 missiles ~ a
strategic and mobile nuclear intercon-
tinental missile.

Weinberger made the disclosure to
back up arguments that the United
States can‘t afford cutbacks in military
spending. At the same time. ad-
ministration sources said President
Reagan has decided to ask Congress for
slightly more than $311 billion for the
Pentagon for next year. The figure
below the original plan for a $354
billion budget.

new trial in its battle with Pennzoil.
The move by the nation’s third largest
oil company had been expected. At the
heart ofthe matter is the $11.1 billion
court judgment Pennzoil won last
month. That’s when ajury agreed that
Texaco broke up the merger of Penn-
zoil and Getty Oil so it could take over
Getty for itself. The motion for retrial
lists 320 alleged errors in the original
trial. It also questions the qualifications
of District Judge Solomon Casseb and
asks that he remove himself from the
case. The move from Texaco comes
less than one day after Pennzoil broke
off talks aimed at reaching a possible
settlement. Pennzoil rejected the Tex-
aco offer and called for a federal in-
vestigation into news leaks concerning
the deal.

‘ ‘Hazing ’ ’
Examined

Over the past several months, a behind—the-scenes con-
troversy has been occupying the university student ac-
tivities administration and the local fraternity communi-
ty. Allegations were made last October that two students,
one from Pitt and one from Duquesne University, were
injured during pledge rituals (commonly known as ‘ ‘haz-
ing”) for the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. This week, after
investigations and a hearing, the allegations were proven
to be true and the Student Activities Office revoked Omega
Psi Phi’s charter until at least 1990.

The activities and functions of fraternities in general
have not been beyond reproach. In the worst case, frater-
nities have in the past been labelled as institutions which
propagate conservatism and elitism on campus because
of their strict heirarchical structures and adherence to codes
of sexual and racial segregation. In the best case, frater-
nities have been viewed as houses of refuge for inebriated
football players who attack unsuspecting young women
lured into parties with promises of free beer and “a good
time.” It is to the credit of those few progressive frater-
nities which realized the need for change that the above
criticisms can no longer be raised unequivocally.

But the violence inﬂicted upon those pledges of Omega
Psi Phi leads one to question what actual progress has been
made in reforming the function of fraternities in the cam-
pus community. How many unknown Joel Christians and
Kevin Jenkins are there now rising up through the
brotherhood ranks of other fraternities? Are they better
people for having gone through what they did to get there?
Such questions must be answered, whether publicly or
privately. That someone must suffer a fractured jaw or
a shattered eardrum to participate in a student organiza-
tion is an act of inhumanity bordering on the absurd.

It is particularly unfortunate that the Omega Psi Phi in-
cident involved a student occupying a public position on

‘campus. But perhaps this misfortune will incite us to more
earnestly reflect upon neglected themes which in fact in-
volve us all.

We welcome comment and criticism.

Letters to the Editor

Maintenance Department Negligent

It was immediately apparent upon
entering my Tower B room that a ma-
jor disaster had occured. On the floor
was approximately 3‘/2-4 inches of
water and about ‘/4 inches of black film
and rust. In addition, the room was
filled with steam, creating condensa-
tion so severe that water droplets were
falling from the ceiling. In all, the room
was a wreck. How did this occur, you
might ask? Well. let me describe the
events that led to this climactic disaster.

It was a chilly day in October. My
roommate and I decided to have our
heater fixed before the cold weather ar-
rived. At that point we began putting
maintenance request forms into the
Towers Desk to have the problem
resolved. This formality was diligent-
ly carried out for three weeks with no
results. It was then that I personally
filled out numerous forms and handed
them all in at one time. only to watch
the person throw them in the trash.
Finally, after four weeks of informing
the resident advisor. the Resident Stu-
dent Association. the resident director
and other influential people. the only
thing the maintenance office would
listen to was a very blunt request from
my roommate and me to have the prob-
lem checked into.

Finally the maintenance crew made
their debut. only to tell- me the job
would have to wait until after the
weekend. Monday arrived and happi-
ly we were visited by men dressed in

the standard grey Pitt maintenance
uniforms. All morning they worked on
that heater. Then at 10:30-a.m. they
turned on the hot water to test the lines
by pressure. Supposedly there was a
blockage in the copper line. and this
technique of using high pressure would
blow it out ofthe line. And that it did.
At 11:40. not only was the plug re-
moved, but a gusher of hot steam and
water was pouring from the heater.
And where had the maintenance men
gone? Let’s just say they were nowhere
to be found. After we cleaned up the
mess, our heater still was not repaired.

Looking back over the incident. I
feel compelled to make a few com-
ments. First, I would like to commend
the housing office again for their
superb job in dealing with this dilem-
ma. There was no hesitation in sending
someone to check on the problem.
Also. I feel the resident director should
be commended on his effort over the
pastﬁre weeks in working to remedy
the heating problem. However, I am
strong/_\‘ upset by the incompetency and
negligence of the entire maintenance
department, as they are to blame for
this ordeal. Recently. I’ve learned that
the heater had been damaged for three
years. Is this department so backed up
with work that they cannot repair a
heater in that length oftime, or has the
level of responsibility to serve this cam-
pus effectively deteriorated over the
course of its existence?

I challenge the maintenance depart-
ment to respond by improving their
quality of perfomiance. A university of
this size requires a competent, respon-
sible maintenance service. Also. I re-

generated by on—eampus housing. the

The stresses from decaying
prisons come right back at us, par-
ticularly in the city. A punishment-
oriented prison system creates the
worst imaginable corruption, decay
and mental breakdown. It does not
protect society in any way, beyond
the extreme examples of prisoners
for life; instead itjust increases the
burden by making prisoners even
more unmanageable and leaves
communities ever more plagued.
Overcrowding. above all. makes
community violence and crime
more likely because more correc-
tive institutions have to turn away
offenders. Time and time again the
most knowledgeable minds have
told us that punishment isn‘t the
way to go. Every pain. every breath

Criminality In Modern Times

hidden away in those dark. cruel
chambers is another pang in our
social conscience, and worse — it
is another promise of future
cruelties to wreak havoc on inno-
cent lives. Prison should be a place
of the utmost privacy, maintained
by the utmost resolve to keep
prisoners quarantined from socie-
ty; but, above all, it must be a place
of compassion, help and rehabilita-
tion, even for those who must never
be set free again. ‘
Economically. society can't af-
ford to live in the remote mentali-
ty that several American genera-
tions have enjoyed. Criminality in
modern times will thrive on the
false premises of our civilization
unless something is done. The

belief in force, guns and violence
is very widespread. We sometimes
witness the hideous spectacle of
elected representatives of public
policy behaving like animals; and
those of us who are still sensitive
feel our skin crawl. And, God help
us, it is almost too late to do much
about it. However, building ap-
propriate prisons is the place to
begin.

Each citizen bears the respon-
sibility. sometimes an unlucky one,
to heed the warning signals in peo-
ple. to make time available for peo-
ple with troubles. Only by such sen-
sitivity can we hope to avoid the
terrible anarchy of belligerent
leaders presiding over torture
chambers. —

The Pitt News. January 10. I986

The Bare Bones/Steven Seel  
Caution Advised When Seeking Off—Campus H ou s i n g

Warning to all freshmen or prospec-
tive housing lottery losers: Be careful
in your choice of landlords and think
twice before signing that lease.

Huge mildew stains spot my peeling
bathroom ceiling. The water pressure
in the shower is too low. My sink drain
gurgles every time I flush the toilet.
The ceiling paint in the dining room
also is peeling — directly over the
table. There is a constant draft of cold
air from my uninsulated and poorly
caulked windows and door. My
carpeting is extremely worn (and I
mean extremely worn), and the fur-
nishings in our so-called “furnished”
apartment either are poor or non-
functional. All this for only $400-a-
month rent plus some electric (the heat
and stove are gas).

So. what then attracted Inc to this
apartment? It was roomv and spacious:
it was furnished; it struck me as having
a certain character; and it was in a fair-
ly decent section of Oakland. But, most
of all. it was my Iandlord’s promise to
repair. within the first month. all that
needed fixing in the apartment. With
that promise. it seemed like a decent
deal. I was truly convinced that my
landlord was not trying to rip me off.

Now you think, “Well, you got
ripped off and it was your own fault.“
True. I won’t argue with that. and I am
not trying to pin the blame on anyone
else. I can only blame myself for get-
ting into the situation. I always seem
to get in trouble when I start trusting
people I shouldn’t trust. I think I’m
basically a good judge of character

(being a reasonably intelligent college
person). and my landlord seemed like
a person I could trust. But I got burned.

So. it is my fault that I'm in this lease
for a year. but the fact remains that my
apartment still is in the same condition
as the day I moved in. It also is fact
that my landlord promised to have the
apartment repaired by October. and. as
of December. it still is not done. He
has even been reminded on several oc-
casions. Sure. there are ways to force
him to fix the apartment. like putting
the rent in escrow or calling the health
department. but that creates a huge has-
sle for me. I am a college student with
limited time. Besides that, why should
I have to threaten my landlord for him
to do what should have been done
before I even moved in?

To the best of my knowledge. a
landlord should be responsible for the
property he owns and rents. A landlord
also is a businessman. and satisfying
his clients should be his first priority.
I don't think many businesses could
survive. operating the way some col-
lege apartment landlords do. So. I
guess renting apartments to college
students is really a great money-making
proposition. but it is at the expense of
the student who signs the lease.

I ask you. at a $400—a-month rent and
with a $400 security deposit (for
damages!). is a little maintenance too
much to ask? At least some of the pro—
fit should be put back into the
business — that's how businesses are
supposed to survive. It is strange that
a businessman should need to be told

US, USSR In Danger Of Losing Control Of Events In Middle East

In the wake of the Rome and Vien-

mention Gavrilo Princip. who once
plunged InLIch of the world into war.
He was the youth who. after first
having botched an attempt to kill
Archduke Francis Ferdinand. heir to
the Austro—Hungarian empire. later
stumbled upon the royal motorcade
quite by accident. He fired twice.

chest and his plump wife. Sophie. with
one to the abdomen. It was June 28.
1914, and WWI had begun.

In the plethora of terrorist incidents.
that one must stand out. Within a
month. all of Europe was at war and
by 1917 so. too. was the United States.
Nine million combatants died in that
war. governments and dynasties

and both fascism and communism.

now the name of a square in the
Yugoslavian city of Sarajevo. was
some shot.

Of course. the war Princip triggered
was a war waiting to happen. Condi-
tions were right for it. Everyone knows
that now; not everyone knew it then.
In fact. the escalating retaliation for that
single terrorist incident soon got out of
hand — one nation calling the bluffof
another and no one having the wit to
back down. We still are dealing with
the consequences.

History is too perverse to ever repeat
itself exactly. But the situation in the
world today. particularly in the Mid-
dle East. has some of the same
elements that prevailed in l9l4. The
important nations of the globe are
bound to one another by a series of
alliances and friendships. They. in
turn. are wedded to people and
organizations over which they have no
control. In the Middle East. the Soviet
Union — obnoxious and unprincipled

— supports anyone‘ with the four— or
five—word vocabulary necessary to de-
nounce Israel. It even goes so far as to
arm Muammar Khadafy. the wliacko
leader of Libya.

The United States. while in better
company. is not a lot better off. It now
waits to see what its friend—cuIn—client.
Israel. will do in retaliation for the air-
port massacres. Will it once again at-
tempt to punish Palestinians in
Lebanon. even though they might have
had nothing to do with the terrorist
acts‘? Will that mean taking out the
Syrian surface-to-air missiles in the
Eastern Bekaa‘? Will that mean conﬂict
with Syria and. by extension. with its
patron. the Soviet Union? It is hard to
say and harder to know. In 1982.
Israel‘s punishment of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization amounted to a
war in Lebanon from which it only
recently extricated itself.

The game could get out of hand. We
wait on the actions of Palestinian

crazies (sincere or not. what does it
matter?) and. sometimes. Israeli zeal-
ots. like Ariel Sharon. More responsi-
ble men now guide the Israeli govern-
ment and its army. But they are men
with their own agendas and needs —
their own security concerns — and the
United States is hostage to that.

The obligation ofall governments is
to ensure that terrorists. whatever their
cause. do not get their way. The Soviet
Union in its support of terrorist groups
(and. until its own diplomats were kid-
napped in Lebanon. its refusal to con-
demn them) has not helped matters.
And the United States. byjoining with
Israel to exclude the Soviet Union from
the Middle East “peace process."
gives the Soviet Union no role in L"‘
area where its importance is obvious.
As the Israelis are beginning to
recognize. if it takes the Soviets to arm
the Syrians. it takes the Soviets to
restrain them: Put another chair at the

to take care of business. A landlord
could never charge such high rent for
such a poorly maintained apartment if
the university and its students were not
nearby. Landlords should value and
respect the students that earn them their
living.

I've related my experience so that
others might avoid the situation I’m in
now. When you sign your lease, be
satisfied with the way the apartment
is — it might never be any different,
no matter what your landlord says.
Also. don't think that if your gas and
water are included and you have a gas.
stove and gas heat. that your electric
bill won’t make up the difference. Be
careful in your choices and don’t rush
into a lease —- it could be a mistake that
gives you headaches all year long.

The airport massacres are ominous
acts. Like the purportedly original plan
of the Achille Lauro hijackers. to sail
as tourists to an Israeli port and there
to kill as many people as possible. they
seem to be suicide missions. The zest
for Inartyrdom. up to now a Shiite
phenomenon. seems to have infected
some Palestinians. especially youths
raised stateless in refugee camps. The
threat to world peace. always great. is
now greater.

Gavrilo Princip was proof that ter-
rorism matters. that its consequences
can be more horrible than its horrible
acts. He serves to remind that retribu-
tion. no matter ifeffective or deserved.
can amount to an escalation and
perpetuation of violence. History
laughs at big powers and their deluded
belief that they can control events.
Once again. the sane think they can
control the mad. Princip didn’t know
much. but he knew better.

Pitt landscapes Cathedral lawn for coming bicentennial

By Jack Burkman

Staff Writer
The Department of Physical Plant

has recently completed the first leg of
an extensize project designed to
upgrade the grounds surrounding the
Cathedral. According to maintenance
director Ken Soergel, the project was
inspired by a number of factors. Aside
from being aimed at beautifying the
campus, Soergel said the work is
somewhat commemorative and con-

’ cerned with-safety as well.

"With the univcrsity‘s bicentennial
coming up, we wanted to add a bit of
new landscape to the campus." hoergel
said.

He said he also believes the
Cathedral grounds were done for prac-
tical reasons. Prior to the renovations.
a group of hedges were dangerously
close to the bus lane on the Fifth Ave.
side. These hedges, Soergel continued,
not only partially impeded bus traffic,
but they made mow—plowing an ordeal.

“The Port Authority called me all
the time,” he said. “We plowed the
mow into the bus lane and they [PAT]
moved it right back to the sidewalk.”

To combat this problem, Soergel
stated that the hedges were moved back
and a number of stone payers were in-
stalled between the shrubbery and the
sidewalk as a sort of “catch area” for
now.

Soergel alleges that the rejuvenation

of the Cathedral grounds had become
a practical reality if nothing else. The
lawn, Soergel said, had begun to ap-
pear piecemeal and somewhat
unorganized.

“We took out a lot of the trees and
hedges,” he said. “Some trees had
already been removed because of new
water and steam lines. Others were
lost. Some had outgrown their

usefulness.”

Soergel pointed out that the project
was quite extensive and no doubt
costly. '

“We removed over 43 old shrubs
and replaced them with about 100 new
ones,” he said. “We also added
roughly 600 evergreens. The hedges,
in particular, were in a very severe
state of decline. We replaced over

1,000 hedge plants with a different type
which will hold better.”

Soergel and Richard McLellan,
director of the Department of Public
Plant, agreed that much more must be
done with the Cathedral grounds. Ac-
cording to McLellan, the university is
“only about 30 percent of the way
through” with this project. He said that
what has been done might be regarded

 

Maurice Pisciottano/The Pitt News
as some sort of “step program".
Soergel, too, stated that the work was
incomplete “and that some upgrading
of the area near the Heinz Chapel might
take place, possibly, next fall.”

Both men mentioned that while the
university purchased all the new plants,
independent contractors were respon-
sible for the actual installing of the
shrubbery.

states are still suffering from the effects
of the 1981 recession. Since the start
of the 19805, cities and towns in these.
states have lost jobs, factories,
businesses and people.

Futrell called attention to a recent
report by the Business Advisory Com-_
mission of the Education Commission
of the States which disclosed that
millions of children and youth are at
a “greater risk of being lost to society
as productive individuals.”

These are children, the report noted,
that have the potential for success, but
they lack the skills, family support,
discipline and motivation to make it in
everyday life.

Whenever the name Steven
Spielberg appears, it consistently
transforms pupils into dollar signs and
those same eyes into tear-beaded
hollows. When E. T. The Extra-
Terrestrial became America's top
grossing film, Spielberg’s “magic,” as
it has been labeled, became an all-
encompassing timbre of tiny feet flux-
ing in and out of theater doors all
across the land of bread and honey.
After two years of nothing but Steven

dam our tearducts as The Color Purple,
directed by Steven Spielberg, inun-
dates film houses nationally. The tim-
bre has now swelled into thunder as
the boy genius has finally matured to
cinematize adult situations appealing
to the adult-minded.

When Alice Walker agreed to allow
Spielberg to film her Pulitzer Prize-
winning novel The Color Purple, she re-
quested that the story must accurate-
ly detail the book’s original format, and
one—third of the technicians must be
black or third-world. Her wishes were
honored, and the final product

blossomed forth to become the most
artfully crafted and superbly acted
drama of 1985. »

theatergoers with their first smattering
of tears; but what appeared to be the
forefront of a strong cinematic 12

the depths of Sylvester Sta|lone’s

Dear Editor, Teen Beat. Hipness isn’t something

[Concerning] your article on Friday,
Dec. 6 e— all the world may be a stage,
but Upstage certainly isn’t the real
world.

The definitive sign of unhipness is
having to make a “do and don’t”
checklist to define how hip you are. if
you need a list, then face it — you’re
not too hip!

Any Type A nerd with a dollar and
a LCB card can put on Girbaud jeans
and dance with his reflection and look
cool three nights a week.

Leave the crass generalization to

you can order from the Commander
Salamander catalog.

If the hip-cool—and-groovy crowd
would calm down and show some
originality, instead of following
prescribed guidelines, Upstage could
be a pretty cool place.

Hors’s Neck sings with lyricism and power

HORSE’S NECK
By Pete Townsend

Houghton Mifﬂin Co.
By George Kresak

Few musicians" have made better
use of rock music as a means of ar-

itistic expression than Pete Townsend,

formerly of The Who. In Townsend’s
music there is ever a balance struck;
an integration of what is base and what
is lofty in the human experience. ills
musical compositions erupt in a kind
of raw power suggestive of the
tempestuous riot of emotions and
desires that is only too familiar to us
all. Yet the naked energy of his music
is tempered with a lyricism that is as
haunting as it is beautiful. These
elements, that have made Townsend’s
music so memorable and have placed
him among the most seminal of rock
musicians, are very much in evidence
in Horse’s Neck, Townsend’s fine,
well-considered first book.

This volume, a collection of in-
tegrated, compelling vignettes, fairly
pulses with life as it chronicles with
painful candor the follies and failings
of a tormented soul in search of
transcendent beauty through life and
through his art. There is revealed in
Horse ’s Neck a fine sensibility at work
struggling to cleave through the muck
of reality and to know life intimately.

The horse becomes the central
metaphor in Townsend’s account of

his grapple with
childhood memories,

side to his love. imperious, adolescent
yearnings and growing carnal desire
come to corrupt his innocence and his
symbol of purity is devoured by lust.
Ever in pursuit of his lost innocence,
yet ever bound to fail, he falls captive
to a destructive, crippling disso-
luteness. in the end, Townsend,
although not quite easy, quiets the tur-
moil of desire and learns to strike a
balance, as it were, between sensual-
ity and purity in sort of uneasy
coalition.

This revealing interior look at Town-
send’s life testifies to the finitude of the
flesh and the paucity of sexual desire.
The tragedy of his years of excess is
that the pure love that has always in-
spired his art had become lost to him
as he gave himself over to an
obsessive indulgence in tawdry sen-
suality. It is not until he escapes his
enslavement to sensual excess that he
is able to rediscover some essential
part of the purity of youth and to im-
bue his art and his life with renewed
dignity. ,

it would be misleading to give the
impression that this volume is not
without its flaws. For all its merits,
Townsend’s prose is awkward at times

and there are sections that seem plod- '

ding and stilted. But what Townsend
lacks in refined literary tools he makes
up for in earnestness and instinctive
lyricism. While Horse ’s Neck is hardly
great literature, it is, for the most part,

a skillfully written, well-packaged work -

that is well worth the reading.

Pat Benatar

learns to

usesex the hard way

SEVEN THE HARD WAY
Pat Benatar
Chrysalis Records

Pat Benatar has run the gamut of
pop emotion. From early hits like
“Heartbreaker” and “Treat Me Right”
to 1984’s album Trop/co and its no-
nonsense pop fluff like “We Belong,”
her career has mirror-imaged her own
personal life: desirable young starlet
joins band, falls in love with guitarist,
gets married, has baby. Can’t you just
hear it: We be/ong/We belong
together?

Well, she’s back on the streets.
Seven The Hard Way is her seventh
album. On the one hand, it’s a realiza-

. tion of how long it took her to get the

big hit she’s always wanted, while on
the other hand, it’s a kick—ass affirma-
tion that she hasn’t forgotten what it’s

like to be out on her own, alone and _

lonely. Remember her dressed in a
black leotard, leaning languorously on
the radiator, staring out the window,
waiting for her lover to come back just
so she could kick him right back into
the alley? That was 1979’s In The Heat
Of The Night, the tough Benatar debut
album, the sultry, sweaty girl-next-door
who took no guff from anybody, the
heroine with a melting multi-octave
voice.

Much of Seven The Hard Way is just
as sultry. The album opens with “Sex
As A Weapon,” a rollicking excursion
into jealousy that’s also a wonderful
video idea (even if the video readily

dispels the presumption that the song
is a conscious turn on Benatar’s part
against Neil Geraldo, her guitarist and
husband). You really do know how to
strut that stuff, she sings, like she’s just
caught Geraldo sucking down ice
cream sodas with the candy striper
from behind the counter. Also strong
is “7 Rooms Of Gloom,” a rumbling
remake of an old Ho|land/Dozier/
Holland tune with Benatar unleashing
perfect doses of energy, spirit and
emotion.

With the exception of “lnvincible,”

the album was produced entirely by.

Neil Geraldo. Benatar hasn’t called on
long-time producers Keith Olsen or
Peter Coleman for this one. After
1984’s miserable Tropico, that might
have been a wise choice. Geraldo’s
done nice work here: guitars lash out
at the right times in harmony with
Benatar’s voice and, for the first time
since Get Nervous, the keyboards on
Seven The Hard Way seem to compli-
ment rather than compete with
Benatar’s big-band rock sound. As a
result, band members blend together

' more convincingly than in the past.

“Walking In The Underground,” with
its passionate vocals, ominous horns
and hollow synthesizer, echoes ‘‘In

The Heat Of The Night,” while “Le Bel .

Age” and “Run Between The Rain-
drops” are the tamer undertakings.
Side one closes with “Red Vision,” a
song that glares with a vehement vocal
performance; actually, it contains the
most apocalyptic bass Benatar has
{HT ' 3*

“{~‘§

ever snarled her way through.

Better still is theclosing cut, “The
Art Of Letting Go,” in which Benatar
strips-down her soul, admitting she’s"
human, admitting she’s capable of lov-
ing and of being hurt by love (The more
I love, the less / know/About‘the art of
letting go). it’s an engaging Benatar
staple that shows off her voice without

Page 11 '

 

becoming arrogant or overbearing.
Although some Benatar fans may
realize Seven The Hard Way is nothing

profoundly new, it’s affecting,
theatrical rock and roll that puts Pat .
Benatar’s heart back on the line.

This is love
LOVE

Sire Records

Simple Minds came to the fore-
ground of new music by playing songs
with catchy, repetitive hooks that
started as tense, hushed melodies and
built up to dramatic, near-anthemic
conclusions. The Cult knows this prin-
ciple well, and puts it to effective use
on their album Love. Multiple layers of
William Duffy’s guitar work build one
on another, turning each song into a
hypnotic example of impassioned, pro-
gressive rock music. By a|bum’s end,
it’s hard not to feel exhausted after ex-
periencing so much energy and fervor.

Love opens explosively with the
enlivening “Nirvana.” Duffy’s guitars
slam chords and pick out flowing runs,
while lan Astbury’s vocals soar above
the instruments. After such an intense
track, one might expect other cuts to
seem pale, but The Cult never backs
down. “Rain” chugs along to the beat
_of the album’s guest drummer, Mark
Brzezicki of Big Country, while bassist
Jamie Stewart slaps a note for every
whack of the drums. “Revolution”
thins out the sound a bit, emphasizing
chord changes and soft, “ahh-ing”
background vocals. “Black Angel”
contrasts the haunting minor chords
and amplifier tremolo of its verses with
an airy chorus.

The Cult often ends up labeled a
’60s-esque psychedelic band, a
classification the group seems uncom-
fortable with. While “The Phoenix”
does recall such music with its chants

of Fire and Astbury’s command, Well,
‘dig this! and occasionally, especially
on the title track, Duffy’s soloing recalls
Jimi Hendrix, The Cult seems firmly
entrenched in the '80s. Love sounds
bigger, fuller, cleaner than anything
out of the paisley underground, and
has an almost indescribably unique
musical identity. Surely The Cult has
been influenced by ’60s rock, but just
as surely, the group has used that as
a springboard for creating its own
sound. _

The Cult’s album Love may not be
for everyone. The band’s entrancing
melodies are played with a rough,
hardcore edge that for some might
make the record difficult to listen to at
first. But if one takes the time to get
wrapped up in these intense, original
songs (if one doesn’t fall for them right
away), Love proves to be quite a re-
warding musical venture. If you’re in
search of unique, aggressive sounds,
begin your new year by discovering the
exciting, adventurous record Love
from The Cult.

FORBIDDEN FRUIT
The Blow Monkeys
RCA

The press release accompanying
the Blow Monkeys’ Forbidden Fruit ep
lists critical comparisons with Mark
Bolan and T. Rex, -Roxy Music and The
Style Council. Quotes accompanying
the pictures of the band members on
the record sleeve seem like grand

testimonials. Mick Anker said: “The
bass is an extension of my being,
every note a heartbeat, every string a
limb.”

Saxophonist Neville Henry added: ‘‘I
live only for the sound of my horn.” If
nothing else, the Blow Monkeys cer-
tainly seem serious about their music
and ready to take on the biz’s best.

But much of this five-song collection
falls far short of the expectations one
might have after the critical praise the
band has received. This 12-inch “bo-
nus” record amounts ‘to little more
than a throwaway; practically unintel-
ligible vocal ramblings, by Jamaican
singer Eek-A-Mouse, add to the clut-
ter of “Sweet Murder’s” instrumental
workings, and “Kill The Pig” turns
from a boring salsa exercise into a
listless attempt at rap.

The ep’s first song fares much bet-
ter, however. The title track, produced
by former Style Council producer Peter
Wilson, shimmers with Dr. Robert’s al-
ternately breathy and dynamic vocals.
The fullness of the sound, topped by
smooth horn work, gives the track a
spellbinding richness. “The Optimist”
is a pleasant, if forgettable, upbeat
rocker, while “My America” builds
around engaging tinny, phlanged

guitar strummings and hazy lyrics: My -

America/ I ’m not in love with her  If
we all turn together/ lt’ll be forever.
Forbidden Fruit seems to be an at-
tempt at highlighting the stylistic diver-
sity of the Blow Monkeys, but, in the
end, it only frustrates the listener.
While this collection has its trappings,
it certainly hints at the excellence a
cohesive, full-length effort might pro-
duce, if cuts like “My America” and
“Forbidden Fruit” are any indication.
The Blow Monkeys’ big claims did

make me sit up and take notice; now
l’m eager to have more of their
material make me do the same thing.

Del Amitri:
pure pop

DEL AMITRI
Del Amitri
Chrysalis

The freshest new sound of 1986
comes from a good-natured Scottish
quartet who call themselves Del Amitri.
Working within the venerable tradition
of Anglo-pop, but with an
acousticlelectric guitar sound and
vocal arrangements uniquely their
own, Del Amitri make for some of the
most purely listenable rock music
you’ll hear for a long time.

At their best, which is almost
everywhere on this album, the band
sounds like a happy hybrid of The
Smiths and XTC, except that the
vocalist (whoever he may be — the lp
comes with little information) has a
distinctive north country burr.

At their worst, which is only for
fleeting butdistracting moments, the
band’s fondness for major-7th chords
and tight harmonies leads them
perilously close to America (“Horse
With No Name”) territory.

But that is the only possible com.-

" plaint about what is otherwise a pretty

damn wonderful record. Starting with
the one-two punch of “Heard Through

a Wall” and “Hammering Heart,” Del

Jewel of the Nile: Michael Douglas’ little gem

By Lori Faiella

It was so romantic: a wedding at

just about to complete their wedding

finger  when  out of nowhere a
blazing pirate ship appears, crashing

focuses on the circumstances and
perennial victimization that many
black, Southern women endured dur-
ing the early twentieth century, and
their later emancipation as indepen-
dent women who were capable of
economic and emotional self-
sufficiency.

While the casting and plot is
centered around black orientation and
attitudes, the main theme behind the
film is the evolution of women from Vic-
torian domestic slaves into dignified,
capable people. The film from this
viewpoint then analyzes the in-
cestuous birth of Celie’s two children,
her status as a 14-year-old child-bride,
her sisterly bond to Nettie (Aksua
Busia), and, most significantly, her
emotional and intellectual awakening
vis-a-vis the nightclub chanteuse Shug
Avery (Margaret Avery).

From the opening pan through the

but a thrilling two-hour adventure has
begun.

In The Jewel of the Nile the famous
couple from Romancing the Stone
have returned in another extravagant

adventure. Produced by Michael.

Douglas, who also produced Romanc-
ing the Stone, The Jewel of the Nile
contains the same off-beat humor. It
may be a little corny, in the tradition of

purple field of posies, Celie’s tender at-
tachment to Nettie is established, cen-
tralizing the film’s theme of feminine
bond and the alienation of women
within the tyranny of masculine
domination. When Pa (Leonard
Jackson) sexually relieved his emo-
tions upon the pubescent Celie, hein-
stills a distaste for male supremacy in
her being, effectively causing Celie to
embark upon a life with emphasis
placed upon female relations; conse-
quently, it is not unrealistic when Celie
bonds herself to Shug during her bat-
tered marriage to “Mr." Though their
on-screen mise en scene suggests a
lesbian relationship between the two
characters, its presence within the nar-
rative is not repulsive or unsubstan-
tiated; but, with respect to its PG-13
rating, Spielberg apears once again to
be toying with the boundaries of the
Motion Pictures Board of Review’s
continued on page 13

the romance novel, but the timing and
the charisma that exists among the
characters help to make the movie fun
and entertaining. -

The film brings back the al|—familiar
cast from its predecessor. Michael
Douglas plays Jack Colton, the free-
spirited adventurer still in love with his
“favorite” romance novelist Joan
Wilder, played by Kathleen Turner.
The chemistry created between the
two of them in Romancing the Stone
remains. Ralph, the puny antagonizer
played by Danny Devito, is back to
cause the couple as much misery as
possible while he continues to seek his
fortune. Ralph is indeed the true idiot
of the film,_ the one who always gets
the blame, whether he deserves it or
not. DeVito’s other roles include Louis
DePa|ma, the dispatcher on the hit
series Taxi, as well as several movie
parts.

The Jewel of the Nile is a wild adven-
ture that takes you from the thrilling
French Riviera to the sandy,
dangerous deserts of North Africa. The
adventure begins when Joan is prop-
ositioned at a reception given in her
honor. The current African leader,
Omar Kalif, wants Joan Wilder, the in-
ternationally known romance novelist,
to write his story. Of course, she ac-
cepts, leaves Jack and is taken off in
a blur to Africa.

Jack, feeling like he has just lost it
all, runs into his old enemy Ralph, who

is hiding in a garbage dumpster. Ralph
is still after the “Stone” from Romanc-
ing. As Jack tries to reason with the
slightly insane Ralph, he is proposi-
tioned by an Arab tribesman. All that
is required of Jack is that he come to
Africa immediately to help rediscover
the “Jewel” which willin turn bring him
closer to Joan. The two of them are
once again entangled in the same web
where they can bravely risk and save
each others’ lives.

The plot is a crazy one, overlapping
in various parts, crossing in others, but
in the end it is resolved nicely. The
“Jewel” isfound and returned to its
proper place, but there is no profit
made in this one because of the nature
of the jewel —— it’s not a typical gem.
Although no one walks away financial-
ly wealthy, with the exception of Ralph
— who finally gets something for all his
tortures, he even makes a few friends
in this one — everyone sails away hap-
py and satisfied once again.

The Jewel of the Nile is a fun kind
of film, and some of the lines and
scenes are hilarious. Imagine a group
of nomadic Arab tribesmendancing
with a huge box to “Get Down and Par-
ty.” Although humor filters through the
movie it does not lack suspense. Jack
and Joan find themselves face-to-face
with death on several occasions, in
situations remarkably resembling
those she has written about in her own
savagely romantic novels.

definition of parental guidance. is les-

bianism an appropriate theme for

young teenage audiences, even
though the film itselfis difected toward
an adult population?

While sexual awareness is, in
essence, the beginning of maturity, the
film also emphasizes the importance
of education. After Nettie’s stay at
Celie and Mr.’s farm home, Celie
responds to Nettie’s initial need for‘fur-
ther understanding through an open
reading of Charles Dickens’ Oliver
Twist. And in what appears to be the
most structured and fluid edit within
the film, the young teenage Celie’s
hesitated speech evolves aurally into
a steady flow of competent diction. So,
while Celie refrained from speaking in
the presence of Mr., her psychological

', __ interior was unmistakably literate. We

gain this proof through her ability to
capture Shug’s admiration, and like-
wise through her growing confidence
as a vocal member of her familial and
community environments. After “Pa”
tells her, “You have .the ugliest smile
I’ve ever seen,” she begins to cover
her mouth with every fleeting amuse-
ment; but later, after realizing that a
smile non-verbally conveyed joy to
others, she banners her pearly whites
and progresses to speak her attitudes
and beliefs.

While The Color Purple emphasizes
the 40-year transition of the singularly-
named Celie, we gain a strong sense
of her community by way of her
relatives and friends. The film
recognizes the importance of com-
munication within cloistered settings,
as a means to keep the ever-changing
tones of society’s placement of women
publicly accessible.

When Celie confirms her self-
admittance into adulthood and in-
dependence, we imbibe a determina-
tion and strength which is not

characteristically part of mainstream.

King: Taste of Your Tears

I must confess that I hate this guy’s
last single, “Love and Pride,” so much
that I approached this one with a
distinct bias. Happily, though, this
song is leagues better than its dance-
hump predecessor. lt’s a nice, fluffy
pop tune with a catchy chorus. Even
King’s annoying voice doesn’t ruin it
entirely, so I can give this a fairly firm
recommendation.

Stay away from the re-mix, though.

B
The Alarm: Strength

There are altogether too many
bands imitating U2 these days. The
Alarm, however, were the first and are
still the best of the lot, and unlike The
Cult, for instance, they have their own
identity. Mike Peters’ voice has im-
proved a few notches since the band’s
initial ep, and the group as a whole has
gotten its chops down pat. Still, it ain’t
the real thing. B

Clannad: A/most Seems (Too Late to
Turn)

I recently saw a British TV movie ti-
tled Harry’s Game, and was much
more interested by the theme music

models. Celie is dependent on herself,
and, in a manner that is attributed to
strong individuals, she se|f-commiting-
Iy becomes a pillar within her environ-
ment steadfast and ready to face the
immediate future — closing her eyes
to the past. Consequently, as Steven
Spielberg remains a statue of success
for Hollywood, it is Whoopi Go|dberg’s
performance as Celie which solidly an-
chors The Color Purple as a keystone
within Hollywood’s narrative arch of
non-racial depictions of non-white
situations. The Color Purple is the one
to watch come the March 24 Academy
Awards presentation, which will

decidedly forecast whether Spielberg

will be the one to watch in the future.

Amitri waste no time declaring their ter-
ritory: tight, well-constructed songs
with hooks lurking around every cor-
ner and sudden eruptions of three—and
four-part harmonies that make your
heart leap. And the production is so
crystal-clean you could bathe in it.

The record then winds its way
through a variety of moods, exploring
the various stages of malelfemale rela-
tionships (and God knows there aren’t

many expressly heterosexual bands’

around these days), always with taste,
tenderness and compassion.

The only problem is that you may
have difficulty finding this album, but
I urge you to make the effort. You
could try calling Jim’s Records and
pestering them to get more copies (I
bought the last one), or you could write

Or you could come to my place and

than by the flick itself (which actually
wasn't all that bad). That song, which,
it turns out, is titled “Theme from
Harry’s Game,” appears on this four-
song maxi-single by a mysterious Irish
band called Clannad. Clannad writes
songs in the Celtic mode, with lilting,
distinctively Gaelic melodies, but in-
stead of playing accompaniment on
traditional acoustic instruments, they
use, believe it or not, synthesizers.

This may sound horrible, but the ar-
rangement works beautifully since the
instrumentation is generally way in the
background, the songs being for the
most part an excuse to show off the
female lead vocalist’s gorgeous voice.
The four songs span the band’s last
three albums, dating from 1982.

If you’re feeling adventurous and
want to hear something a bit different
but very, very lovely, take a chance on
this band’s music. This record is a
good introduction to it. A

The song starts and gets into the verse
sounding very ordinary, but just as you
start to think nothing interesting will
happen. the melody takes a gorgeous

    
  

  

   

twist and launches into a great, rabble-
rousing chorus. While there is no
sense of spontaneity, each aspect of
the song being obviously planned and
plotted for a specific response, the
musical ideas are solid enough to
legitimize the rather contrived song
structure. There is no doubt that the
Thompsons sat down and said “Let’s
write a hit single,” but they can be
forgiven. Unlike, say, Phil Collins, they
interpret their new-found popularity as
a responsibility to be interesting, not as
a luxury to be exploited. And they keep
you humming.

ZZ Top: Sleeping Bag

I have never claimed to be “cool,”
I have never claimed to be “fun,” and
I have never liked ZZ Top. Not even a
little. I am not amused by their cute lit-
tle videos or their cute little beards. I
do not like their “buzz-saw” guitar
solos. I do not, nor have I ever, found
anything even slightly interesting or
funny about them.

Their new single is exactly the" same
as any of their recent singles. I need
not describe it. You, being an
American between the ages of 18 and
25, will like it and buy it. I cannot
change that. I can throw my own copy
out the window, which I have just done.

Music has suffered a great blow with
the loss of D. Boon. He was killed in
an auto accident in Arizona on Dec.
22.

Dennes Dale Boon created one of
the most successful underground

. bands — The Minutemen. The Minute-

men’s success stemmed directly from
their original and eloquent style of con-
veying social commentary.

While each of the Minutemen —
George Hurley on drums and Mike
Watt on bass — is quite masterful on
his instrument, it was D. Boon’s jazzl
blues/punk guitar style that gave their
music its distinctive edge. His lyrics,
well, his lyrics speak frankly, in-
telligently and truthfully:

What is peace to the people
who work the land and die in

war? It was learned in a game
that was played by us. All who
held the top of the hill from the
rest was called the King, and /
can ’t believe it all was good for
humankind and l have to read the
lies between the lies. Is it peace
to point the guns, is it war to fire
the guns? We would run with all
of our might, push the King off to
take the hill and to learn who was
King and who made a better serf. '
Believe in this: We are part of a
whole we call the Earth.

D. Boon
“King of the Hill” 1985

People familiar with The Minutemen
know that D. Boon was not only a
guitarist and poet, but also an ac-
complished painter. He created the

Most people don’t know what D.
Boon was really like.

Dennes was completely sincere
about his work. He believed everything
he wrote. He performed his music with
his soul. His often-cynical revelations
were tempered with a mysterious sen-
sitivity. I don’t think commercial suc-
cess would have bothered Dennes, but
he never sacrificed his integrity to
reach the lowest common denominator
we call “the mass market.” Open-
mindedness was the key to his entire
lifestyle. Without the slightest bit of
pretension, D. Boon became a promi-
nent spokesman of the thoughts and
fears of his fans. He was a really nice
9UY- _

The Minutemen’s last lp, Three Way
Tie for Last, came out just before D.
Boon’s death. It is a very good album.

Pitt looks to take luster off Pearl

Dwayne “Pearl” Washington

A

Chaz Palla/The Pitt ews

 

 

orts

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

For Pitt guard Curtis Aiken, Friday’s
game with the Syracuse Orangemen at
the Carrier Dome and his expected
showdown with Dwayne "Pearl"
Washington will be a test.

However, the real test may be
Washington's ability to guard Aiken.
who enters the Big East contest as the
second leading scorer. He has averaged
21 points in his first three conference
games and trails only St. John’s Walter
Berry (26.3 ppg) in points per game.

In four prior meetings, Washington
has never guarded Aiken as Pitt’s
shooting guard. Before this season,
Aiken’s responsibility was to run the
offense from the point. That role
changed when Aiken moved to
shooting guard a few games back.

As for an Aiken—Washington
showdown, it is more of a media hype,
said Aiken, who would rather
downplay such a confrontation.

“Everyone likes to build something
up that isn’t really there,” Aiken ex-
plained. “I’11 attack this game the same
way I would enter any other.

“Being that we’re two players from
the same state and that we’ve played
against one another many times, peo-
ple feel there’s something extra there.
I’m used to it now and it doesn’t bother
me at all. We’re actually pretty good
friends off the court.”

Syracuse will put its unbeaten record
and No. 4 national ranking on the line
against the upset—minded Panthers. Pitt
will enter the Carrier Dome 10-3 on the
year and 2-1 in conference play. The
Orangemen, 12-0, are 3-0 in the Big
East and 1 1-0 at home. Pitt has struggl-
ed on the road at 2-3, with two of those
losses coming prior to Chipman’s
change to a three—guard lineup. _

The new look the Panthers have

\ shown is giving its opponents all it can

handle — and then some. Since the
lineup changes. the Panthers are 5-1,
with the only loss being to St. John’s
in overtime 78-75.

Normally this game would be dif-
ferent from others, but this isn’t the
samebasketball team ofthe past. This
team has the conﬁdence that it can win
anytime and anywhere in the Big East,
and Chipman, their departing spiritual
leader, is making sure that this is
happening. 5

“This game is like any other,” said
Aiken. “There aren’t any changes and
we’re more confident now.

“After beating Georgetown and
playing with St. John’s, when we ex-
ecute I feel we can play with anyone,”
Aiken continued.

If Pitt is to execute its game plan and
play well tomorrow in Syracuse,
Charles Smith will surely be in the mid-
dle of things. Now that Smith has been
moved to the center position, he’s
responsible for battling sophomore
standout Rony Seikaly, the league’s

Page 15

leading rebounder with 11.3 per game.

Seika1y’s improvement in play since
last season has helped the Orangemen
get off to a fast start this season. The
6-10 center from Athens, Greece, had
a career high 20 points in a Big East
win over Villanova. No one is more
aware of Seika1y’s ability than Smith
himself. _

“He’s a really good player and it will
be a tough game for me,” Smith said.
“It’s definitely my biggest challenge so
far.”

Along with Seikaly, WendelliAlexis
and Raphael Addison are also among
the league’s top 10 rebounders. For
Chipman, rebounding power can be a
major headache. ‘

“We have to improve our rebound-
ing,”Chipman said. “With our smaller
lineup, we have to have five guys
crashing the boards at all times.”

Another guy who figures to be in-
volved in such aggressive action around
the boards is Pitt freshman Jerome
Lane. At 6-6, Lane said he must over-
power the bigger 6-9 Alexis to com-
pensate for the latter’s experience and
steady offensive skills.

“I must play as hard as I can against
[Alexis],” said Lane. “He has maybe
better shooting and more experience,
but I can dominate the boards because
I’m stronger than him.”

Notes: The game will be televised
locally by WTAE-TV, Channel 4. The
game begins at 8 p.m., with a, crowd
of 29,000 expected.

_BC halts Lady Panthers win streak

By John Enright
Staff Writer

Last night the Lady Panthers basket-
ball team lost a Big East game against
the Boston College Eagles by a score
of 69-57 at the Fitzgerald Field House.

The Lady Panthers were led by
seniors Kim Gannis and Kim Tirik with
24 and 14 points, respectively. The
Eagles were paced with five players in
double figures. Forward Marie Grant
led the Eagles with 13 points despite
shooting 4-16 from the floor.

Head Coach Kirk Bruce was ob-
viously disappointed with the loss.“I
hope we learned a lot tonight. The top
echelon teams in the Big East come to
play every night and it showed.”

ii; The Eagles took the early lead over

the Lady Panthers at 10-3 and extend-
ed that lead to eight points on two oc-
casions. The Lady Panthers cut Boston
College's lead to 22-20 late in the half,
but went into the locker room trailing
30-25.

According to Bruce. that was the key
juncture of the game.“At the end of the
first half we were there with them but
we didn’t get the job done."

The Lady Panthers came out strong
in the beginning of the second half.
scoring the first eight points to take a
33-32 lead, their first lead ofthe night.
But the Eagles hung tough and took the

, ,;‘,1ead for good at the 16-minute mark on

Q

ajump shot by Kathleen Sweet. But the
Lady Panthers never quit. as they cut
the Boston College lead to 61-55 late
in the game. but they ran out of gas.

The Eagles shot extremely well from

the foul line (19 of 22) while the Lady
Panthers struggled at 9-18. Besides the
lopsided free‘ throw shooting, the
Eagles were able to win the game
because of the strong play of Marie
Grant. Grant crashed the boards for 11
rebounds, causing havoc for Pitt all
night.

Sally Madeira and Leslie Bjerstedt
aided the Eagles attack with combined
12 of 15 shooting from the floor.

Once again, leading scorer Kim Gan-
nis ‘was the standout performer on the
Lady Panther squad. Besides her 24
points. Gannis played stingy defense,
coming up with three steals. “Nobody
is going to stop Kim from scoring, but
she has to improve her defensive play.
And tonight she did.”commented
Bruce.

The loss broke a four—game winning
streak for the Lady Panthers and drop-
ped their record to 6-5 overall and 2-2
in the Big East. Boston College raised
their record to 8-4 and 2-2 in league
play.

The schedule does not get any easier
for Pitt .as they begin an ll-game
period in which they will play eight
road games. The Lady Panthers travel
to Syracuse tomorrow afternoon.
Syracuse knocked off the Lady Pan-
thers last year in the first round of the
Big East Tournament. Pitt’s next home
game is Wednesday evening at the field
house against Big East rival St. John's.

Notes: The loss was the Lady Pan-
thers first ever against Boston College.
Guard Kim Tirik played a strong game.
adding four steals and three assists to

go along with her 14 points. Tirik now
places eighth on the Lady Panthers all-
time scoring list with 686 points.

The Pitt wrestling team stunned -
10th-ranked Lehigh University
last night at Trees Hall as the two
teams battled to a 21-21 tie. The
Panthers had built up a 21-9 lead
following pins by seniors Doug
Haines and Eric Wertz at 158 and
167, respectively, but held on in
the end to draw even blood.

Following an exchange of deci-
sions in the first two bouts, Pitt
senior co-captain Kyle Nellis
pinned Jim Frick at 1:54 of the
first period to get things rolling for
the upset-minded Panthers.

In the next match, freshman Pat
Santoro battled Pete Yozzo, the
second ranked 142—pounder in the
nation, to a narrow 7-6 decision
for Yozzo. Santoro, from

 

Pitt wrestlers proved formidable adversaries.

Bethlehem, Pa., the home of
Lehigh University, led four dif-
ferent times in the match before
falling in the end. However, it
was Santoro’s intense perfor-
mance that spirited the back—to-
back falls from Haines and Wertz.

“Our kid’s wrestled their hearts
out and we got the big pins we
needed,” said Coach Rande Stot-
tlemyer. “I know Pat (Santoro)
feels bad, like he lost the match
for us, but that’s not the case. This
will keep him hungry knowing he
can wrestle with the best. Now he
knows how good he can be.”

Wertz, who collected the big-
gest pin over Kerry Retrievi, was
certainly inspired by Santoro’s
gutty performance. “He’s a spark
to this whole team. His non-stop
motion gets all of us to work even
harder, especially the upper
classmen.”

  Pitt surprises Lehigh

Lehigh coach Thad Turner was
also equally impressed, not only
with Santoro but with the entire
Pitt team. “We felt it would be
tough coming in, and it didn’t sur-
prise us at all. I knew when Rande
(Stottlemyer) first took over that
he would get this team going and
he’s doing that right now.“

Following consecutive pins for
Pitt, Lehigh fought back in the
ﬁnal three weight classes with two
decisions at 177 and at
heavyweight. With the help of a
forfeit at 190, the Engineers did
save a hard fought tie.

Pittsburgh — 21. Lehigh — 21

Pitt track at OSU

By Roy Bigler
The Pitt News

This Saturday the men’s and
women’s track teams will be
traveling to Ohio State University
to compete in a tri—meet with Ohio
State and West Virginia. It will be
a test for Pitt as neither the men nor
the women have seen action since
before the Christmas break.

“They are not in as good shape
as they should be, but we have
been practicing hard all week,”
said head coach John Vasvary.

In the four years that Vasvary
has been the head of the track pro-
gram, Pitt has not been able to
defeat either West Virginia or Ohio
State in dual competition. “They

are two ofthe better teams around
and we really will have to prove
ourselves." Vasvary said.
According to Vasvary. the men's
team does not have the depth to run
away with the meet. They tend to
lack significant performances in
some events, competitors in others;
and the field events are the weak
point. “We have some guys dou-
bling up just so there is somebody

in that event and because of that,  ’

there will be points that we will not
be able to pick up,” Vasvary said.

The Panthers would like to do
well in this meet, but in order to
do so, they will have to perform as
a team and cannot rely on a few in-
dividual performances to makeup
for what they lack in depth.

Lady Panthers open season

By Julia Stitely
For The Pitt News

The Lady Panther gymnasts open
their home season this Saturday at 2
p.m. against Temple University. Pitt
beat Temple last year, and a win this
Saturday can get the Lady Panthers’
season started on the right foot.

Temple is not to be taken lightly.
however. Pitt Head Coach Donna Sanft
said, “Temple should be improved.
They were a good team last year."
Temple hired a new coach in October
and this may be a disadvantage.
However, Sanft added, they will
benefit from a good recruiting year.

The Lady Panthers are a young team
this year, with only two seniors and one
junior, but they have experience as last
year’s entire squad is back. Seven
sophomores and four freshman will
provide the needed depth.

Swimmers’ win streak on line at Penn State

By Gary Geller
For The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s swim team has
been one of the most successful
varsity sports at Pitt in the past two
seasons. The Lady Panthers have
amassed a 16-meet winning streak,
including an undefeated 9-0 record
in 1984-85, and a 7-0 record thus
far this year. The Lady Panthers’
program currently is ranked 16 in
the nation and first among teams in
the East.

Victories over early season foes

The Pitt women ’s swim
ming and diving team will put
it ’s I6—meet winning streak
on the line this weekend when
it travels to Penn State for a
dual meet with the Lady
Lions.

The Lady Panthers will be
paced by Jodi O’Neil, shown
here at the right. 0 ’Neil is a

junior from Webster, New
York.

The Lady Panthers are
coached by David Belowich
and Julian Krug.

Kent State, Virginia, Syracuse and
Brown are impressive accounts of
the Lady Panthers’ strength in
swimming. Last month at the
Clemson Invitational, which was
held in Puerto Rico, Pitt defeated
all three opponents easily, and in
the process, sharpened their skills
for upcoming meets.

A crucial meet will take place
tomorrow at 1 p.m. in State Col-
lege when Pitt takes on Penn State.
This meeting will match two of the
strongest programs in the East.

Penn State currently is ranked third
in the East. The Lady Nittany
Lions team also is undefeated and
it will pose a great challenge to the
Pitt swim team.

According to Coach David
Belowich, Pitt’s success is due to
hard work and teamwork.
Belowich said, “In order to be suc-
cessful, we must keep doing things
together with strong performances
from everybody.” He hinted that
the Penn State meet will be the
toughest on the schedule this year,

Chaz Palla/The Pitt News

especially considering that there is
such a big rivalry between the two
schools.

Belowich said he thinks both
teams are quite evenly matched and
for Pitt to win, everybody will have
to contribute with top perform-
ances.

Among common opponents this
season, both Pitt and Penn State
have beaten Virginia and Syracuse
in dual meets. An extra factor,
which weighs in Penn State’s
favor, is the fact that the meet is
being held in State College, which
could give the Lions an added
psychological edge over Pitt.

Penn State swimmers to watch
out for include Jeneane Wilkins in
the sprints, sophomore Cathy
Zoranski in the 200-yard butterﬂy,
200—yard freestyle and the
200—yard individual medley.

Pitt will counter with junior
Tracy Pﬁster and freshman Tricia
Rickert in the 200-yard freestyle
and with junior Jodi O’Neil in the
200—yard individual medley. One
of the top 200—yard butterﬂyers in
the East,
Haughton, will have to give a
strong showing to help defeat Penn
State.

In the sprints, Pitt will call on
two—time NCAA All—America
Susan Hickman to anchor their at-
tack. Also, two of the fastest
sprinters in the East, Cindy Rose
and Alicia Dugan, will have to con-

sophomore Judy _

Page 17

tribute with solid performances.

The team’s enthusiasm is equal
to its winning potential. At the
beginning of the season, before the
numerous victories took place,
Belowich said, “We believe we’re
among the best teams in the coun-
try. There’s a lot of planning and
theory put into practice in our pro-
gram. That, and the fact that we
have a group of talented, deter-
mined athletes, enabled us to have
the kind of season we had last
year.”

NFL Roundup
Dolphins favored as season closes

Last season. the wounded Chicago
Bears scraped. clawed. kicked and bit
their way into the NFC Championship
game. just to be not only beaten but
also blanked by a dominating San Fran-
cisco team, 23-0. The 49ers went on
to win Super Bowl XIX. while the
Bears quietly licked their wounds and
plotted for the next eight months. em-
barrassed and angry. Real angry.

Chicago came out of their dens in
1985 roaring. playing like a team
possessed. They ripped through their
regular season schedule. posting a lofty

15-1 record, then squashed Little Joe
Morris and the rest of the New York
Giants in the first round of the playoffs.
Now they are back to the point where
they fell short last season -— in the NFC
title game, eagerly awaiting the arrival
of yet another West Coast opponent.
the Los Angeles Rams.’ This time. the
Bears are healthy and confidently
grooving to their “Super Bowl Shuf-
fle.“

Well. the media has bombarded the
public with info on the new Monsters
of the Midway throughout the entire
year, so to refrain from bleeding a
stone. here’s a brief rundown on their
upcoming 12-5 opponent.

The Ram defense is loaded with
talent, especially in the secondary. Los
Angeles snatched 29 passes from op-
posing quarterbacks this season, and
will probably steal a few from Bear QB
Jim McMahon. Linebackers Carl
Ekern, Mel Owens and George An-
drews all had tremendous years and
will prove to be a hindrance to the great
Walter Payton. Los Angeles’ defensive
line is only slightly better than average.
but seems to get the job done each
week. By no means will the Bears have
an easy time scoring points, but 

Offensively. Los Angeles comes in—»

to the game looking almost like plain
vanilla: Eric Dickerson off left tackle.
Eric Dickerson off right tackle. Eric
Dickerson past defensive tackle.
linebacker and through the secondary.

The Pitt News. January 10. 1986

By Thomas Danyluk

The former SMU racehorse piled up
L234 yards rushing during the regular
season. then tacked on another 248 in
last week’s playoff against Dallas.

But here‘s the catch: Stop Dickerson
and the Ram offense can collapse like
a house of cards.

With ex—CFLer Deiter Brock behind
center. the Ram passing attack is com-
parable to a black hole — null and void.
Receivers Henry Ellard and Drew Hill.
and tight end Tony Hunter all could
start for almost any NFL team. but
Brock. the supposed Man with the
Golden Arm, hasn’t put up the big
numbers that were expected of him.
Los Angeles‘ passing game is mediocre
at best in the warm California sun. In
freezing Chicago, it should stiffen up
like a figure in some Hollywood wax
museum. then gracefully retire for the
season. The Bears will bounce Brock
around like a pinball. then tilt the Rams
to the score of 26-7.

While Los Angeles and Chicago go
head—to-head in the cold Midwest. the
two remaining AFC clubs will be
sweating out the minutes before their
4 p.m. kickoff in the steamy Orange
Bowl. New England and Miami. both
members of the AFC Eastern Division.
will meet for the third time this year.
The two teams split their previous
clashes, with the Pats winning the first.
17-13. and the Dolphins taking the sec-
ond in a Monday Night spectacle,
30-27.

Anyone who watched Miami’s
heroic come—from-behind win over top-
heavy Cleveland knows that the
Dolphins’ tragic ﬂaw is their inability
to stop the run. While this undeniable
truth sends haunting chills up the spines
of the Miami faithful, New England is
licking their underdog chops. waiting
to kick their Sherman tank running
game into high gear. 1,227-yard gainer
Craig James, the former backﬁeld part-
ner of Eric Dickerson at SMU. is the
key to the Pats‘ success on the ground.
As he goes. so does New England.-

Miami’s sometime Swiss cheese

defense will be keying on him.all after-
noon. obviously. but a new problem
lies in the condition of the Patriot
receiving corps. Greyhound Irving
Fryar will miss the contest due to a
freak household injury he suffered on
Wednesday. While putting a knife in
a kitchen drawer. Fryar accidentally
sliced two of his fingers. The injury res
quired 10 stitches. one of them required
to bind a severed tendon.'

If the Dolphins somehow stop the
New England rushers. the Patriots will
need a formidable passing attack to
keep them in the contest. Stephen Star-
ring will replace Fryar in the lineup and
team with stalwart Stanley Morgan at
the wide out positions. Quarterback
Tony Eason directs New England‘s of-
fense. with wiley veteran Steve Grogap
as a capable backup.

Defensively. New England is solid.
as the Los Angeles Raiders will attest.
Last week, Raymond Berry's “D"
stifled the Raiders throughout the en-
tire second half of_ their divisional
playoff. Defensive backs Ronnie Lip-
pett and Fred Marion will be return-
ing home to the stadium where they
played their college ball for the Miami
Hurricanes. Along with Ray Clayborn
and Roland James, the Patriot secon-
dary will need an outstanding effort to
handle the volatile Marino passing
scheme.

Linebacking is a deﬁnite strong point
for the Pats, with Andre Tippet and
Steve Nelson as their big-play
defenders. The defensive line is steady
and sometimes impressive, but quite
penetrable even to a weak running team
like the Dolphins.

The key to this third Dolphin-Patriot
matchup lies in two aspects: If Shula’s
squad can put a lid on James and his
gamebreaking backfield cohorts, they
can win handily. The other is Dan
Marino’s pass selection. If he tries to
force the ball to his wide receivers. it
could be a long afternoon for Miami.

Still. take the Dolphins in a first-half
brawl, 24-13.

The Pitt News, January 10. I

i Choosing a long distance

ompany is a lot like choosing
a roommate.

        

It’s better to know wht ty’re
like before you move in.

Living together with someone for the ﬁrst
time can be an “educational” experience.

And living with a long distance company
isn’t any different. Because some companies
may not give you all the services you’re used to
getting from AT&T.

For instance, with some companies you have
to spend a certain amount before you qualify for
their special volume discounts. With some »
others, voice quality may vary.

But when you choose AT&T, there won’t be
any surprises when you move in. You’ll get the

same high- quality,
used to.

With calls that sound as close as next door.
Guaranteed 60% and 40% discounts off our Day
Rate-so you can talk during the times you can
relax. Immediate credit for wrong numbers.
Operator assistance and collect calling.

So when you’re asked to choose a long dis-
tance company, choose AT&T. Because whether
you’re into Mozart or metal, quality is the one
thing everyone can agree on.  
Reach out and touch someone?’

AT&T

-     The right choice.

trouble-free service you’re
