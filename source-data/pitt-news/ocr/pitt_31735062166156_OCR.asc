Chapel Music Has
Same Quality As in

French Cathedral’

By JOHN L. STRAUCH

Frederic Lotz, official Uni-
versity organist, looked up
from the gleaming white keys
of the Heinz Chapel organ and
said, “Don’t call me Mr. Lotz
. . . Please , . . Call me Fred.

Everybody calls me Fred.”

Ever since his arrival.at -Pitt.
fourteen years ago, this short,
spectacled musician has been

“Fred” to his University friends. «

‘i,'Before 194i, Fred played in a
great many churches throughout
the country, serving almost every
religious denomination. ’

Although not a graduate of
any music academy or college,
Fred studied under several pri-
vate tutors and did seminar
work in Paris. In 1919 he
studied under Isadore Phillips
and gave recitals in cathedrals
throughout northern France.

Today that same organist who
played in the ancient Gothic cath-
edrals of Europe now gives recit-
als of the same quality lfere in

-Heinz Chapel every Monday,
Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday
from 1 to 1:30 p.m., recording
them for broadcast over station
WDUQ. Surprisingly and very
unfortunately, few Pitt students
take time to attend these sessions.

When asked what kind of music
he usually plays, Fred answered,
“Oh, I play all kinds of music . . .

 

Phot by Don Herr

ORGANIST for the University is Mr. Frederick Lotz who recites
daily, except Wednesday at the Heinz Chapel from 1 p.m. to 1:30
p.m. Fred came to Pittsburgh in 1942 after a career as a profes-
sional organist in many churches throughout the country.

all kinds. Then he added quickly,
“Except that which is no music at
all.”

“Organ music,” he went on to
say, “is a beautiful combina-
tion of many things . . . of
mythology and literature and
art . ._ . that has grown down

0 9 9

through the ages.”

‘He looked down at the organ
again. “Why the organ,” he said
reaching up to wipe a smeared
spot from one of the stops, “is the
most versatile of all the instru-
ments.” He held up a ﬁnger, sig-
nalling for me to listen.

Then he began to play softly.
Suddenly the music swelled to a
deafening roar, then very quick-
ly decreased in volume to a soft

slyly. He then adjusted the stops
in front of him, and the music
that came from the organ
sounded identical to that of the
plucked strings of aharp. Re-
adjusting them, he made the
music sound like tinkling church

- bells, then a deep—toned French

horn, and ﬁnally a brassy trum-
pet.

“If people would just take time
to come and listen to such beau-
tiful music by such great compos-
ers they would be repaid many,
many times.” He sighed deeply
and looked down at the organ
keys. “But today all it is, I guess,
is ‘hit the nail hard on the head
take home a heavy paycheck.’ ”
Then he added sadly, “There isn’t
enough attention given to the
ﬁner things . . . the more im-
portant things.”

The mellow strains of rich
organ music began ﬁlling every
corner of the near empty chapel,
blending with the beauty of the

and intricately-carved Gothic
architecture. I felt relaxed to
ﬁnd myself away from the
hurry and worry of The Cathe-
dral, sitting quietly in a dark-
ened chapel listening to soft
organ music. «

“Why write about me?” he had
asked sincerely. “If you want to
write about something, write
about ‘the beautiful chapel and
the organ and the great music of
the masters. No, you don't want to
write about me.”

He forgot one thing, though. He
is an inseparable part of. all of
them . . . the chapel . . . the organ
. . . the music.

 Homecoming Headaches

“ It would be a pleasant task if we could step right into
the prevalent Christmas spirit today and write a benevolent
editorial about good will and Christmas cheer, but unfor-
tunately we can’t. There exist a few gripes among a large
number of students at the University that should be ex-
pressed atthis’time——gripes—-about Homecoming 1956.

Mark Rubc 21 em and his committee are to be com-
mended on all of the ﬁne phases of Homecoming that took
place this year. They were well-planned, interesting, and

,.colorful. But the reason that some of these events ever
A ‘came about at all is due only to the persistence and -hard
work of the student committee, alumni, membersgof the
Dean of Men’s staff and a few others. Cooperation with
‘ the student body did not come from all departments of

the University and from all administrative ofﬁcials.

There is no doubt that this year’s homecoming could
have been one of the best yet. There were excellent ideas
held over from last year that were to be included in’ this
year’s program-—-as, for example——the ﬂoat parade in the
Stadium. Clyde Barton, Secretary of the Alumni Associa-
tion, expressed the View of many alumni last year When«, he
said in a letter to Richard Cunningham, assistant to the
Dean of Men: , » 0 , -

“I am sure you must agree with others that the ﬂoats
added ‘quite a bit to‘the setting. Homecoming this year

, looked like a real Homecoming and I hope we can continue

the same sort of thing in the future.” ,
This year, however, the student committee was stopped

I in their attempt to hold the ﬂoat parade in the Stadium

Saturday afternoon. The reason—-extra stands were to be
placed on the ﬁeld to handle the expected overﬂow crowd
for the Army game. “The overﬂow crowd of 56,000 people”
didn’t ﬁll the entire Stadium let alone the extra stands on
the ﬁeld. .

But even if they had, we wonder’ if it is asking too
much to request that the stands never be put on the track
for a Homecoming game regardless of the drawing power
of the opposing team. ’ When you consider two things: (1)
the amount of time and work put into these ﬂoats by the
sororities and fraternities, and (2) that it was the wish of
the alumni last year to have such an event take place in
the Stadium, then it appears to be a much sounder idea to

"have an entire Stadium of people view the parade instead

of the approximately 1500 who saw it Friday afternoon in
the Schenley Plaza. '

To say that there did not exist a close association be-
tween students and alumni during the week end is to put
it mildly. When the sororities planned to hold brunches
for their alumnae Saturday morning, they were stopped
because, as the sororities were told, the brunches would dis-
rupt the natural routine of the houses which would be un-
fair to the non—sorority women. ,

- Here a student attempt to bring alumni and students
together was prevented. ,.

It should be noted at this point that Pitt students have
often been criticized for a lack of school spirit. The criti-
cism most times has been justiﬁed. But after witnessing the
lack of cooperation that was characteristic of several home-
coming events, we can’t help wondering-if school spirit——
when it ﬁnally is shown-——isn’t dampened quite a bit by the
words “you can’t do this.” ‘ , ,

The problem of student-administrative cooperation is
certainly not a new one and the solution not the easiest to
ﬁnd. Perhaps the answer to Homecoming lies in the sug-
gestion to organize a committee that would include repre-

I sentatives from all areas concerned with Homecoming. We
admit it may not be the ﬁnal answer, but it certainly sounds
A like a step in the right direction. . . i S

Chess, Like Music

‘Power To Mak

By Barbara Cherington
Few things besides music and art are under-
stood and enjoyed internationally. One of the few
is a game which originated 2500 years ago: chess.
In the vicinity of India, this mind-"challenging
contest began. Popularity of the game spread
through Persia, and the Moslems introduced it to

» Europe. There, by the 13th century, the entire con-

tinent adopted the Asian game.

methods of pay began. 1851 dates
the ﬁrst international chess
tournament which was in Lon-
don and which has continued
annually ever since-

Since the beginning of chess
in 500 BC. sundry combinations
of plays on the M64 squares have
been analyzed. N E a c h entices
minds the world over to think ahead even ten
moves so as to outwit‘ opponents. Unique feats have
been mastered by various chess. players.

Blindfold Master

Blindfold simultaneous chess is one of these

 

feats. Master at this unique accomplishment is ‘

George Koltanowski, winner of national and inter-
national titles‘ in blindfold simultaneous chess. Re-

was his during a former blindfold simultaneous
match.) T l

, Winner of State chess championship recently
was William Byland of Pittsburgh. Byland played
and defeated about 12 University students in a
match here last year. (The Pitt Chess Club has in-
vited him to return for another simultaneous match
this year.) ’

International Contest

Chess awards are given annually to colleges.
Pitt has been asked to send chess delegates to a

chess. The only requirement is time. Author’ of
The Game of Chess, Dr. Seigbert Tarrasch, has said:
“Chess is a form of intellectual productive-
ness, therein lies its peculiar charm. Intellectual
produetiveness is one of the greatest joys-—if not
the greatest one—of human existence. It is not
everyone who can write a play, or build a bridge,
or even make a good joke. But in chess everyone
can, everyone must, be intellectually productive
and so can share in this select delight . . . Chess,
like love, like music, has the power to make men
happy.” *

e Me 

By Stuart Shmith

Many of us as students take
the University with its beauty
and campus life for granted, but
what about the person that sees
ourschool for the ﬁrst time?

Persons who stroll past the
campus in the fall or spring
might think that it is a large
military school as they watch
long columns of uniformed men
march to rythmic cadence -across
the lawn. In addition they see
men in uniform walking through
the halls, and going to classes,
followed by officers of the Army
and Air Force, which no doubt
adds to their opinion. ,

Tour Through Chapel
A walk through the Commons

Room or a tour through Heinz
Chapel with the choir singing,

‘ the organ playing, and students .

"leading the services, might cause
them to imagine that Pitt is a

I school devoted to training future

ministers and religious leaders.

Watching students hard at work

in the‘ ﬁfth, sixth and seventh
ﬂoor libraries could form an im-
pression that much time is de-

‘ voted to burning the midnight oil,

but a look at couples swirling
to a waltz at the Christmas Com-
mons Room ball, would indeed

_show them that “Jack” is a dull »

boy.

After leaving the main campus,
if they went on a tour of Clapp
Hall and the numerous engineer-
ing buildings, the school would
probably take on an air of re-
search and development geared
entirely to the scientiﬁc ﬁeld.

Going from there to the medi-
cal buildings and the nurses’
home, not forgetting all the hos-
pitals, would change that air to
medicine, and the sight of men
and women dressed in white,
could make them think that Pitt
is nothing more than a great
medical‘ school. In addition, since
Pitt is the home of Dr. Jonas
Salk’s research and development
($5 the Polio Vaccine, it would

make it seem even more so.
Emphasizes Athletics
When the tour
Field House, Pitt Stadium, and
Ellsworth Center, the sight of the
football team working out, phy-
sical education classes doing cal-
isthenics, and the basketball
team practicing, makes the school
look as if it emphasizes athletics,

, and must turn out many physical

education instructors. ‘
They also might consider Pitt a‘
haven for tourists when they are

cathedral for a breathtaking view
of Pittsburgh. pi

Of course when the visitors’
tour comes to an end, they real-

ize that none of these schools-P

make up the entire University,
but that each has its ,_Dart in

making the University of Pitts- ;

burgh“ the great educational in-
stitution that it is. These facts"
are not given to just a few peo-
ple, but to many from all over
the world who visit our school
each day.

Letters to the Editor

Editor, The Pitt News:

Jay Butler, in his article “And
Everything In Its Place,” (Nov.
12) proves that he is a very ﬁne
writer; Some of his opinions,
however, lack the high quality of
his prose.

In his stand for art, Butler has
come out with an unproved at-
tack on science, evident in sev-
eral cutting phrases. He says that
our expanding t e c h n oil 0 g y
“clutches at its slide rule with
hot little ﬁsts.” “Hot little fists,”
a phrase depicting .child—like

traits, certainly does not exempli-
fy our expanding technology but
only echoes arrogance,

Mr. Butler later refers to sci-
ence as “the cult of the microm-
eter” and “the brotherhood of the
Bunsen burner.” Despite their
rhetorical effectiveness, t h e s e

.comments, which are actually

generalities placing all scientists
in one small queer-looking group,
show a deﬁnite lack of under-
standing coupled with disrespect.
Then Mr. Butler states that
science may sneer at the idea
that art and artists are indispens-
able. Surely one can see that the
basic principles of scientiﬁc rea-
soning make scientiﬁc sneers
impossible. A sneer is the ugly
symbol of self-righteousness, and
science which progresses by dis-
proving many of its own theories
can therefore sneer at nothing. ~
Furthermore, scientists them-

selves are very comprehensive

-football rally

people who continually serve Mr.
Butler and everyone else with
advances that stem not from a
critical attitude but from a deep
love for humanity. ,
I wonder if Mr. Butler consid-
ered men like Dr. Salk when he
wrote, “It is time for the scien-
tist to come down from his ivory
tower and reorient himself.” I

also wonder if Mr. Butler con-.

siders himself a part of the “in-

sulated mess of society” which

he claims must “come down out

of the trees and relearn to live.”
Joseph Ungar, Pre-Med
Col. ’59

Editor, The Pitt News:

Monday morning following the
in Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial Hall, I was
walking up Bigelow Boulevard
just as the students left the rally.

Ahead of me was a frail, old,

   

lady going in the opposite direc-
tion from the students who were
walking four and ﬁve abreast on
the sidewalk.

This lady was forced up onto
the terrace of the P.A.A. by the
students. I quickly stepped ahead
of her and secured a path, only
by incurring several head-on
collisions with students. «

We frequently hear comments
from the public regarding the
attitudeof Pitt students, whom I
have always loyally defended
against such criticisms. I am
wondering whether perhaps these.“

criticisms are justiﬁed. Surely

one of the ﬁrst lessons a student
should learn is the lesson of
c o m m o n courtesy. Apparently
some of the Pitt students have
not yet learned this lesson.
Very truly yours,

Package Deal’ ' Offered

SC Scans Expenses To Miami

By MILLARD AMDUR
Student Congress is investigating the various modes of
transportation for a student trip to the Miami game. The
least expensive offer was that of Regina. Air Lines. Round
trip fare from Regina is $75.24 or $88.65 in a package deal
providing two nights at a quality hotel, transportation to

and from the airport, and a ticket to the game.

Airtime is ﬁve hours each way.

Capital and Eastern Airlines
provide no group rate. Their
regular fare is $39.06 per round
trip. By chartered Greyhound bus,
the trip would cost $40 for a
group of 37 students a saving of
$16 over the standard round trip
rate. By Greyhound, the travel
‘time each way is 36 hours.

The Baltimore and Ohio Rail-
road has a group rate fora min-
imum of 25 students in coach
at $65 for the round trip. The
train trip takes 30 hours.

Without the interest of the stu-
dent body in such a project, Con-
gress will be unable to organize a
student trip. Students who desire
to take advantage of one of these
offers should sign the appropriate
list available at the Student Desk.
A $5 deposit will be required.

Rally Held

Committee Chair-
man, Stanley Goldberg, Col. ’59.
announced that a pre-game pep
rally might be held prior to the
Miami game, depending upon the
departure time of the team.

Art Steinberg, Col. ’57, spoke
and structure of the Pitt Indepen-
dent Association. The new or-
ganization will be known as Or-
ganization on Student Affairs.

The Athletic Committee lav-
ishly praised the success of
Block P, the student demonstra-
tion section. Members of the
committee felt that it added
“immeasurably” to the enjoy-
ment of spectators.

The problems connected with

‘~"‘this year’s homecoming will be

eliminated by a co-ordinating
committee of all the groups in-
volved. Floats next year will be
paraded inside Pitt Stadium,
should the students desire so.
Proposed Plan

Bob McCabe, Col. ’57, reported
to JC on a proposed. plan for or-
ganization of a Judicial Commis-
sion to enforce the conditions of
the rally pact. Council approved
formation of the commission un-
der McCabe’s plan. The commis-

sion will act as an enforcement,

LITTLE sronnas WITH BIG MORALS
First Little Story

Once upon a time when the inventors of the airplane
were very small boys, the roof on their house developed
a terrible leak. A repairman was called to ﬁx it. He set
his ladder against the side of the house, but it was a
very tall house and his ladder was not quite long enough
to reach the roof.

“Sir, we have an idea,” said the boys who even at that
tender age were resourceful little chaps. “We will get
up on top of the ladder and boost you up on the roof.”

So the boys climbed to the top of the ladder, and the
repairman came after them, and they tried to boost him
up on the roof. But, alas, the plan did not work and they
all came tumbling down in a heap.

MORAL: Two Wriglzts don’t "make a iruxng.

Second Little Story

Once upon a time a German exchange student came

from Old Heidelberg to an American university. One A

night there was a bull session going on in the room next
to his. “Ach, excuse me,” he said timidly to the group of
young men assembled there, “aber what is that heavenly
smell I smell?” *

“Why, that is the fragrant aroma of our Philip Morris
cigarettes,” said one of the men. »

“Himmel, such natural tobacco goodness!”

“It comes in regular size in the handy Snap-Open pack,
or in long size in the new crushproof box. . . . Won’t you
try one?” ‘

“DanIceschb°n,” said the German exchange student
happily, and from that night forward, whenever the men
lit up Philip Morris Cigarettes, he never failed to be
present.

MORAL: Where tIze'rc’s smoke, tlzere’s Meyer.

Third Little Story

Once upon a time Penelope, the wife of Ulysses, had
herself a mess of trouble in Ithaca. With her husband
away at the Trojan War, all the local blades were wooing
Penelope like crazy. She stalled them by saying she
wouldn’t make her choice until she ﬁnished weaving a
rug. Each night when her suitors had gone home, Penel-
ope, that sly minx, would unravel all the weaving she
had done during the day.

 

      
    

  

 W.   .. i. /

‘Veil sir, one night she left her rug lying outside. It
—rained buckets, and the rug got all matted and shrunken,
and Penelope couldn’t unwind it. When the suitors came
back in the morning, the poor frantic woman started
running all over the house looking for a place to hide.

Well sir, it happened that Sappho, the poetess, had
come over the night before to write an ode about Penel-
ope’s Grecian urn. So she said, “Hey, Penelope, why
don’t you hide in this urn? I think it’s big enough if you’ll
kind of squinch down.”

So Penelope hopped in the urn, and it concealed her

Opening Victory
Rides on Balance,
High Scoring Duo

By ED KOLTISKA
.With the Panther gridders

Bowl—ing, fading away, Coach ’

Bob Timmons willbe kicking
off the basketball season this
Saturday night as his hoop-
sters travel to meet the North
Carolina State Wolfpack.
This will be the third meeting
between the two schools with
North Carolina State dominating
both games, 77-42, and 62-54.
Coach Timmons will be out to
better last season’s record of

15-10 which was the best season
for the Panthers since the 1940-41

V campaign.

Veteran Team To Start

A veteran array will start the
Wolfpack contest with the excep-
tion of Don Hennon, a sophomore
from Wampum. Hennon was the
high score on the freshman team
last year.

Vlteturning from the 1955-56
squad are Co-captains John
Riser of Washington and Bob
Lazor of Canonsburg. Chuch
Hursh of Irwin and’ Julius
Pegues from Tulsa, Oklahoma,
will round out the starting-
lineup.

This year Coach Timmons will
have added strength in returning
lettermen ‘Barry Brautigam of
West View, Howard Lester of
Pittsburgh, Milan Markovich of
Aliquippa. John Laneve of New-
ell, W. Va._. and Phil Kleiman of

Pittsburgh.

Booters Lose
To Penn State

For the ﬁrst time in three
years, Coach'”“‘Leo Bemis’ soc-
cerman ﬁnished the season on

the unfavorable side of the
.500 mark.

The locals’ 3-0 loss on Satur-
day to the defending National co-
champions, Penn State, gave them
a ﬁnal chart of three wins, ﬁve
Although
the Lions were not as strong this
year as they were in 1955 when
they and Brockport were NCAA
co-champs, they nevertheless out-
classed the sophomore-dominated
Panther eleven. _

John Lawerence, outstanding
Lion. goalie, ‘continued his su-
perb play in the nets in gaining
his sixth shutout of the season.

Sam Hazou wound: up as the
Oaklanders’ leading scorer for the
season with ﬁve goals while
Chuck Kane was the runner-up
with four. In all, the Panthers

could score only 16 goals, a rather '

poor average for ten games. Their
opponents did slightly better with
a total of 24 points.

Bemis was naturally disap-
pointed as far as wins and losses
go; but he expressed satisfaction
with the play of his inexperienced
sophomores. “Those boys who are
in their first year of varsity soccer
played better than I had hoped.
Some of them had never kicked
a soccer ball before this year. We
have a good nucleus for 1957.”

The only front line booters who
will not be back next year are
Ben Cheshelski, Paul Griffiths,
Jack Hill, and Dennie Neuman.

' A host of sophomores will get
their first taste of varsity ex-
perience this year. Heading the
list are Dave Sawyer of Mt.~
Morris, New Yam, Lloyd Simp-
son of Irwin, and Robert Ver-
derber of Pittsburgh.

Sophomores gridders Art Gob

den of Homestead will join the
squad at the conclusion of the
football season.

State Stresses Offense 4

The Panthers will meet one of
the top ranked teams in the na-
tion in North Carolina State. Last
season the Wolfpack aggregation
won 24 of their 28 game schedule.

In doing so, the Wolfpack
averaged 83 points a game while
yielding 71 points to the opposi-
tion.

Although North Carolina State
lost four starters via the gradu-
ation route, Coach Everett Case
is expected to have a top-flight
team ready to meet the Jungle
Cats. Their biggest loss was All-
American Ronnie Shovlik.

Team Improves
With the Panthers in practice
since Oct. 15, Coach Timmons has
seen marked improvement in his‘
squad. The Patther hoop mentor
says, “This year the squad has
more speed and is moving the ball

much better. Riser and Lazor re-
ported to practice in better phy-
sical condition which has imporv-
ed their playing game.

“Pegues has improved on his
drive while both Hennon and
I-Iursh have shown better shoot-
ing ability in practicesessions.”

The Panthers chances of pull-
ing an upset will hinge on a
balanced scoring attack. Lazor
in two years has scored 804
points while Riser has found the »
mark for 751 points.

The school record for a three-
year high total of 930 points is
held by Ed Pavlick during the
seasons of 1952-54.

Both Lazor and Riser are cer-
tain to break this record although
Pav1ick’s mark of 622 points in
one season is expected to stay in-
tact. 1

Pegues and Hursh, both with
only one year of action behind
them, are 011:‘ to a good start scor-

The satisfying part is what it should have been; the dis-
heartening aspect is what it actually was. These two words—-

satisfaction and disheartenenment-—describe the 1956 Panther
harriers better than any others. Satisfaction stems from the

regular season record of 5-1; disheartenment from their
eighth place ﬁnish in defense of the IC4A championship whic
they won for the ﬁrst time last year. “

The only dual meet loss was to Penn State, 21-34. It
came when Vince Timon, sensational sophomore runner, was
,..’£1ospitaliied with food poisoning, and the other'Blue’and
Gold hill and dalers were still recovering from various ail-

’ irnents. , i ‘

More signiﬁcantand heartbreaking, however, was the
locals being unseated by Michigan State in the IC4A’s. Next
-to the NCAA crown, the IC4A title is the highest honor that
can be associated, with a cross-country team. vAfter winning
last year, one hardly could see how they would fail to re-
peat this year. -‘ , ‘ ’

Returning were veterans Arnie Sowell, J im‘Moore, Wen-
dell..Harford, Thorton Smith, Jack Shubert, Tom J essup, and

‘Perry Jones. These seven would form the nucleusfof another

gychampionship team. Sophomore help would be found from

among Vince Timon, Paul Jessup, Dale Fauser and Paul
Christof. All would be ﬁghting to edge into the seventh
spot. There was little doubt that Timon would be the seventh
member, though.

Hehas all the equipment——stamina, spéled, and spirit—to
be a great performer on the cross-country trails. As a fresh-
man Coach C551 Olson avoided running Timon against the
varsity because he was better than most of them at that
early stage. Olson did not want to “show ’em up,” and since
freshman were ineligible for varsity competition, Vince was
groomed under the grace of an observing Olson who has de-

veloped him into one of the best runners in the country. In 2

the recent IC4A marathon, Timon ﬁnished third, only 22
«seconds behind the winner-—Henry Kennedy of Michigan
State. , .

The IC4A mark of 24:30.2, set by Charley Capozollj of
Georgetown 111 1952, was not only erased by the ﬁrst place
ﬁnisher Kennedy (24:01.8) and the second man Lewis’ Stieg-
lity (24:24) of Connecticut, but Vinnie’s time of 24:26 for
the thlrd spot also topped the record.

Sowell’s deserving trip to’ the O1
successful, wrecked the Panther chan
one—two punch against the ﬁeld. .

Another severe blow was dealt the Blue and Gold wh n

Brighten Horizon
For Coach Neiger

. T h e Panther gymnastics
team is rounding into form in
preparation for its third sea-
son of varsity competition.
The expectations] for the Uni-
versity’s youngest athletic
group are high according to Coach
Warren Neiger who says, “This is
potentially the best team we have
had yet.” i -

This year’s squad has an ex-
cellent veteran backbone of per-
formers who will be reinforced
by several new varsity men. At
present, plans call for a twelve-
man team, with the possibility of
a few additions.

Heading the list of holdovers
is the versatile Jack Hammond,
a junior, who placed ﬁfth in last
year’s NCAA championships in
the ﬂying rings. Hammond is a
consistent performer in four‘ dif-
ferent events. Another NCAA
place-winner is junior Tom
Darling, who ﬁnished second in
theiﬂying rings event.

Other varsity returnees include
junior Jirn Mulvihill, a specialist
on the.high, parallel, and hori-
zontal bars; senior Don Shima,
tumbler; seniors‘. Joe Lamartine
and John Petrakas on the side
horse;*Charles Kerber, horizontal
bar; and rope climber Dave Ruber.

Three sophomores and a junior
constitute the new blood of the
team; Soph Don Neeld is a tum-
bler as is Dave Hirst, a soph, who
also competes on the ﬂying rings
and horizontal bar. Sophomore
Ron Kohn and junior John C'aco-
lice are new rope climbers.

The Blue and Gold acrobats will
initiate their season on Jan. 12
against West Chester State Teach-
ers, an early victim last year. Al-
though the team broke even in
1956 on an eight-match schedule,
a tougher slate of nine meets and
two tournaments is in the ’57
ofﬁng.

panther  _M.-...... an  
ide Bowl Fu

By MURRAY A. CHASS

To Dec

 

Exceptfor a little matter of classes, the growling Panther
gridders may be able to take an extended vacation deep
down in the land of sunshine and bikini bathing suits.IF they
put the initial loss on the record of the Miami Hurricanes.

If the Jungle Cats get by the de-6

fense-minded Hurricanes, they
would still‘, according to various
bowl officials, have a chance to
travel north to Jacksonville and
the Gator Bowl, or even west to
the Cotton Bowl at Dallas.
Usually, bowl teams are al-
ready select-, '
ed by the
second week
in December,
but this year
is an excep-
tion. It seems
that both the
Cotton and
Gator Bowl
‘c o m m ittees
are willing to
wait until Pitt tackles Miami
before they decide where to
send invitations. v
Glenn Marshall, chairman of
Gator group, says that one selec-
tion will possibly be .,made after

Marshall further indicated that
Wyoming and Syracuse are the
two non-Southern teams being
considered besides Pitt. In Syra-

not be as foolish as the Lambert

On this point, Petro and his
assistant coaches Dick Manson,
Dick Deitrick, and Rudy Mat-

Sepsi, a pre-dental student,
comes to Pitt highly touted. In
his senior year of high school foot-

to the All—American High School’s
second team.

For the third straight year Tom

been hampered by injuries most
of this season. V

The All-Chemical team players
are chosen mainly for their schol-

Having played four years of

year at Brownsville when the
regular fullback got hurt. From
that time on, he remained in
Coach Warner Fritsch’s lineup.

Starred in All-America Tilt
He led the Big Six Conference
in scoring in his junior year and
ﬁnished among the top three
scorers in his senior season. Both
times he was named to the Big
Six and Fayette All—County all-
star teams. As a senior, he also
was named on the All-State’s ﬁrst
team after having placed on the
second team the year before.

Selected to play in the All-
American game in Tennessee

Ex-Panther Star
Priatko Continues
Career in Service

Bill Priatko, former Panther

role at center last August.

and second string centers from
last year’s squad.

Priatko showed that it doesn’t
take him long to learn a new posi-
tion as he played in all of his
team’s games without even mak-
ing the ‘minimum number of mis-
takes expected. And defensively
he was an oustanding linebacker.

A ﬁrst lieutenant assigned as

side ‘such scintillating stars as
Ralph Guglielmi, Dan Shannon,
and Minnie Mavraides of Notre

Maryland; Al Barry of Southern
California; and Chuck Frank of
Michigan State.

Another player who took full
advantage of Priatko’s stalwart
blocking was Billy Reynolds, a
former Panther star in his own

As Courtney Wins ‘300’ Title

Arnie Sowell, the runner
who was given the best chance
to bring Pitt its second Olym-
pic gold medal, failed in his
attempt to win the-800—meter
race. In fact, Sowell failed to
win any kind_of medal at all as he
ﬁnished a disappointing fourth in

day at Melbourne, Australia.

were the right ones. They were
the trio who ﬁnished ahead of
Sowell in thatorder.

Courtney, who has been the
local star’s favorite foe for the
past three years, proved that he
had “it” in the race that count-
ed. His. time of 1:47.’? was the
fastest any runner has ever’
done the “800” in an Olympic
race. Sowell’s 1:483 also broke
the old Ga/mes’ record, but for

senior saw his dream of a little
piece of gold in his frail, sweaty

hands evaporate. ' ~
