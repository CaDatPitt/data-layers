Aim of the cam-
paign is to raise

Leaders of the
drive also :plan' to
establish .a ‘Dr.
John 53. .Suther- jﬁosenberg
land Senior Football Award” with
anysurplus funds which may be acol-
lected. ‘This award'will‘be present-
ed annually to ‘the senior football
player with the highest quality .,-point
average.

.Dr. John .G. ..Bo.wman, Chancellor
of .the .University,.-made the ‘first con-
tribution .to the campaign, which '=b.e-
gan xwednesday. ,>In -.-addition “to -:the
student drive, faculty “members, al-
umni, and Pittsburgh business .-lead-
ers are being solicited for contribu-
tions by a joint committee headed
by Emil Naric, BA40, founder of the
project.

At a meeting of the student, facul-
ty, and alumni committees Tuesday
night, plans were made for the com-_
pletion "of the campaign.

Printing ‘Shop of
About  Tons

University Uses

By ’ George Hyde

If-students werezasked who printed
the ‘posters around the University
they~see and read each "day, most of
them would not -know that they were
done under the .direction of ‘George
W. Langdale, xsuperintentlent of
printing at the University. Proba-
bly most of them =.woul‘d not even
know that the University‘:has.=:a,print-'
ing shop of its own.

Yet posters are just :.one of many:
printing jobs done 'by :-Mr. 
dale’s department. Approximately‘
six tons of paper are used “for »print
jobs each year. Dance "tickets, Uni-
versity office forms and "stationary of
all kinds, small catalogues, dance
programs, for Heinz Chapel and Fost-
er Memorial, convention literature,
and textbooks are some of the other
types of material printed.

NEXT T0 GYM

A11 summer session bulletins and
The University announcements, a
bulletin distributed to faculty and
administration members, are also
printed at the shop, which is located
in the long frame building next to
the gym.

Mr. Langdale started the shop in
1917. At that time the shop was in
the dental inﬁrmary next to the old !
Mellon Institute. Later it was!
moved to its present location, where
it has been for the past 18 years. i

While he was doing his printing}
work, Mr. Langdale also attendedl
afternoon, evening. and Saturday;
classes, and in 1922 he graduated'
with a Bachelor of Science degree
from the School of Education.

21 YEARS

During his 21 years of association
with the University, Mr. Langdale
has watched the growth of his de-
partment parallel that of the Uni-
versity. When he started in 1917 he
had one press and he was the sole
stall‘ member. Now his shop has four
presses, and regularly employs ten
persons. The department takes up
one—quarter of the building, and is
comprised of an office, composing
room, press room, and stock room.

Since the total enrollment of the
University is approximately 11,000,
Mr. Langdale has plenty of work.

Ruth Miller Claims Current Crop
Of Hoofers Make Model Pupils

By Gertrude Messeroff
Slowly the waltz came to a close,
the last tinkle of the ivories died
down, and Oscar Shelfler, C42, took
-his arms from around Dave "I'.uckaer,-
C41. ‘

“At Your Service,” nodded -her
blonde head approvingly. The piano?
started again and the -boys “lined, up
for ..a French “can-can” number.
This number, conﬁded Miss Miller, is
the .one the ‘boys like best. 0
PLEASING PERSONALITY
The boys are model pupils, an’?! catch
on quickly to the most i"
steps,” she said. The boys themsel-
ves think Ruth Miller a model teach-
er, with loads of patience and a-
pleasing personality. As one “cute
little girl” stated, “she teaches what
will please with thegreatest of ease.”
A contract with the Alvin theater
prevented Ruth Miller from accept-
ing Cap and Gown’s invitation 'to
teach the dancing routine four years
ago. She has been dancing in Pitts-
burgh theaters since she was a child,
and has produced her own shows in
St. Louis, Milwaukee, Chicago and
other cities.
'I’A.'I‘RIOTIC SPIRIT
In Pittsburgh Ruth Miller pro-

shows. She did all kincls of dancing
at the Penn theater when it first
opened, at the Stanley, and the En-
iright. Of her work at the latter
itheater, she laughingly tells of the
,time she was doing a toe-dancing
‘solo and thought she could dance on

lights and the edge of the stage,.
At rehearsal, all Went well.

But during the performance she
danced toward the run and looked
up over the audience, just as the
white spotlight turned. Blinded by

to ﬁnish her steps, and fell into the‘

ing an American ﬂag which had beeni
decorating the stage. Ever since,
Miss Miller has been kidded about
her patriotism.

W0 weeks ago. Jan Masaryk placed in the

(I‘{.‘.ze-clioslovak room the dedication message of his
innnortal father. and asserted that Czechoslovakia,
“corner

of the Cathedral."

Czechoslovakia was then a tiny, twisting Euro-
pean state, bounded on the north by Poland, on the
.<:ou‘r_l'i b_v Hunga1'_v. and in all other directions by
Nazi Germany. Now it is no longer conﬁned to
boundaries, no longer limited to sprawling central
European countryside; it is now World-wide in
scope, existing in the hearts of all respecters of
truth and fair dealing and decency. And the . . .

New Czechoslovak Room . . .
conseqiiently, has developed into more than an or-

'(linar_v nationality room. It has become a symbol of

dcmoc1'ac_v in a world which is rapidly being made
Safe for autocracy. And it preserves a cross-sec-
tion of the culture and heritage which have
.<4i.a.n1ped that country indelibly on the pages of

_'ll istory.

llluch has already been said about the brutal
crime that has been perpetrated upon a defenseless
people. Any more comment on our part would be

._1_ncrel_v rehash.

iut we would like to take on the role of prog-
nost.icator or historian of the future, and make an
obs-c1'vatio11 which is, of course, pure econjecture
on our part. Adolph I-Iitler’s latest move, in taking
over Czechoslovakia. seems to us the ﬁrst step in
the downfall of the brown-shirted Feuhrer.

The hostile reception the conquering Hitler re-

ccivcd in Prague is the harbinger of . . .
Danger Ahead . . .'
_At‘t.er the Munich deal. Hitler was really “o11 top
of the world," with the acquisition of artiﬁcially-
incitcd Sudetens and luke-warm Austrians, with
little ei"fcc'live outside opposition.

Now he has acquired a protectorate over deﬁn-
i:"r~‘._v liostilc elements. who will never rest until tlney
.~:;-c the conqueror overthrown. Napoleon and Alex-
ander the Great made the some mistake, and both
pz‘n,i(l dearly.

Oppression is nothing new to the Czechs and
Slovaks. For centuries. they have had their ups
and downs, mostly downs. Both the Czechs and
the Slovaks, the latter betrayed by a bumbling
sccessioiiist lllll’lOl‘ll_V, will no doubt. make certain
that. present conditions will be only “tenipo1'a.ry.”

l\l:(‘E‘.l1\‘.'llll(’, the central European developments
have rczarulted in all sorts of unorthodox adjust-
ments by the opposing‘ nations. In France. a dc-

Au Revoir

To Jack Hoeveler who formerly ﬁlled this space on
Fridays. He did a mighty ﬁne job—if you don’t be-
lieve us, ask him.

Sam Rosenberg will not be collecting the ducats
tonight at the Military Ball he will be inside
dancing with Sametta Seligson. Others on the ﬂoor
will be . Eddy Catalino and Marg Winter .
Eon Boyd and Betty Toddie Gray VVeIler and
Ginny Childress . . Ray Gripp and Jane Bell . .
Dick Page and Louisa Gabbert . Tom Hart and
PCW‘s Betsy Colbaugh Jim Detillo and Peggy
Brennan . . Al Ceveris and Jean Ivory.

Thursday last the Engineers held their annual stunt
smoker and the IE5 pulled the Wool over their opponents
eyes and carried off the cup for the third straight year.
Give all the credit to fern engineers Francis Fisher and
Ann Logue who were conspicuously placed in the front
row and caused the other departments to cut the laugh
getting parts from their skits.

Pipe Comment

Every one wanted the word on that snappy little
wooden shoe that Jimmy Baldwin was smoking this
week so we got the straight story. It is deﬁnitely a
pipe and it was brought from the Dutch West Indies
by Jim’s parents who recently vacationed there. Ruth
Mcﬂenry, who has steadied with Jim for nigh on to
eight years, received some exquisite hand carved coral
bracelets.

Tom Brigham is carrying a newspaper clipping of
his secret passion close to his heart these days and from
good source we l.earn that she will be in town for the
dance tonight the first date Tom has had in a
long time.

Charlie 1\/Iathias got up early today to meet a train
bringing his Military Ball date from Buffalo.

Joe McCormick was seen racing through the down-
stairs corridors the other afternoon and in earnest
pursuit was Susan Rigby. When they ﬁnally quit the
chase and stopped for breath we questioned them
about their actions. Joe responded with, “I told her I
was busy.” Bill Murphy was seen riding with snow
from the mount . . mercy what a girl!

When Emil Narick is in his home town he is a con-
sistent dialer of a certain Elm Grove number . . yet
when he is in this town and that certain party previ-
ously mentioned blows in the idea of phoning never
enters his mind. The truth fellows is this . . . -the girl’s
name is Betty Hannig and she goes to Mount Mercy.
Ask Emil why he never calls . . we can’t ﬁgure that
answer. I

Going South
Herb Stoecklin and former Pitt sigh getter Bob
Sully leave April sixth for the land of the blue grass.
Their destination is the U of Kentucky and their
dates are two of that school’s coeds. g

They’re playing football in the Commons Room

Collegians Temperate,
Says N atiorewiele Poll

By Student Opinion Surveys of America:
(TOPYIRIGIIT. 1939

AUSTIN, Texas, March 23.-—ln expressing his atti-
tudes on the ever-present problem of drinking, the
average American college youth is quite a liberal.
Briefly, results of one of the most signiﬁcant studies
yet conducted nationally by the Student Opinion Sur-
veys of America show that:

1. Eight out of every ten are opposed to the
return of prohibition.

2. Only 34.8 per cent think collegians drink
too much.

3. Almost six out of every ten admit they
drink.

Although prohibition and drinking in general are
not such newsworthy topics as when the Eighteenth
Amendment was still part of the Constitution, one often
hears the comment about the excessive indulgence of
Joe College. Perhaps the inhabitants of American campi
are biased about themselves, but a rather large majority
of them holds that college students as a Whole should
not be classed with those who habitually go over the
line The country-‘.vide poll taken for The News and
other member publications, points out that 65.2 per
cent are of the opinion that students are moderate
drinl-;ers.

While aware that liquor does create 3 social problem,
9. still grecitcr majority holds that a law against it is
not the w:—iy out. To the question, “Do you favor the
return of prcbibition?”——

YES, said . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..21.6 per cent
NO, said . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..’78.4 per cent

In asking, “Do you ever drink?” interviewers for the
Surveys meant any kind of indulgence in alcoholic
beverages. The poll, of course, does not reﬂect the de-
gree of drinking, but rather attempts to present the at-
titizde of college youth on the subject and to discover
actually how many do drink, or at least admit they
drink. The results show that almost 60 per cent say
they do But exact ﬁgures cannot he arrived at, because
in the tabulations have to be included those who may
have wished to conceal what they consider ‘their “guilt”
CI‘ Wanted to be boastful. Those who refused to answer
were not included in the results.

' The Question:

“What effect will the recent Eu-
ropean developments have on the
 United States?”

§The Answers:

:Clair V. Duff, L40.

3 There seems to be no end to the
]territorial demands of the dictator-
iships. Sooner or later the democ-
fracies, especially the United States,
lwill be forced to abandon their
glackadaisical attitude and intervene.

I

lAlbert Schnupp, E1140.

I Things look bad in Europe at
l, the present time, but I believe
‘ that this is only a sample of the
! situation which will spring from
; ItaIy’s demands on France. I be-
lieve that Germany and Italy are
cemented together more than ever,
and with cooperation of Japan the
three Fascist powers are ready for
; a showdown.

Once London and Paris are
bombed, I believe it will be al-
most impossible to restrain Amer-
ican public opinion.

Ruby Pernell, C39.

War is the most probable outcome
of the European situation. The U.
S. would probably be drawn into it
if it should last very long. I think
it will be interesting to see how l.ong
lvlussolini will sit back and let Hitler
take Europe. The strings on his
“second” ﬁddle may break.

 

George Bozic, C41.

I think that our common inter-
ests with England will eventually
end up with our forming an alli-
ance against the dictatorial powers.

Charles Fischer, C4-2.

If war should come in Europe and
if the U. S. should refuse to ﬁnance
Gern1any’s enemies I believe that a
period of forced prosperity would re-
sult here followed by another de-
pression at the war’s end.

Mitterling Must Drive
Pitt Baseballers Hard
11 Outdoor Workouts

Mentor Plans
First Practice
Tilt Tomorrow

Don’t look now but there are
people in the Pitt Stadium seats!
For the sake of the record, let
it be said that the people" (three
of them) are student managers of

coach Ralph I\litterling’s baseball
team, and they are chasing balls that
have been slammed up into the
stands by the Panther sluggers.

Out of doors this week for the ﬁrst
time, the boys have been teeing off
frequently on batting practice pitch-
es in an effort to convince Mitter-
ling that his club packs a punch.

Mitterling, as yet, seems uncon-
vinced, his only remarks being that,
“‘It’s still too early to make claims.
Wait until we've had a little more
Work.”

On the face of it, Mitterling’s po-
sition the next few weeks is unen-
viable. Forced by poor weather to
limit his club’s workouts to mere in-
door warmup sessions in which the
boys sweated the frost out of their
arms, the Pitt mentor ﬁnally got his
team out on the diamond Monday,
just three weeks from the opening
game with Georgetown.

In those three weeks, Mitterling
must slash his squad to 25 men,
pick his varsity, and hold tryouts for
a freshman team. The one bright spot
in the landscape is the fact that the
pitchers, alone of all the prospects,
have been able to practice under con-
ditions approximating those affect-
ing their actual play on the ﬁeld.

Weather permitting, the Panthers
will get their ﬁrst chance to show
their stuff in competition when two
pick-up teams clash in an intra-club
practice match tomorrow afternoon.

Although Mitterling would only
reply, “We’ll see,” when questioned
Wednesday about the makeup of his
inﬁeld, the prospects seem to have
been sifted to ten_ or eleven hopefuls.

The starting quartet will proba-
bly include Guandagnino on ﬁrst
base, Patterson at second, Bob Foli-
art, former Langley High star, at far
corner, and either basketballer Eddie
Straloski or Al Holbrook, former
Allderdice High ace, at short stop.

The left side of the inner defense
cordon, although it would be capa-
bly ﬁlled by the men previously

Scheiding, and Eddie Hughes

are
close behind the now-favored four-

some. First base may also be cov-
ered by either Drobnuski or Gus
Troy.

George Hartman and Salko seem
in as the back stop boys. The carrot-
thatched Hartman should be the
front line receiver, although Salko
will keep him moving.

From the dozen or
who appeared for the ﬁrst practice,
the probable starters now number
ﬁve, two lefties and a trio of right-
handers. Joe Treola and Andy John-
son, the southpaws, have displayed
plenty of smoke but both have a ten-
dency to revert to the traditional
lefthander’s weakness, wildness.

Lanky Red Pommerschein and Ed
Lawry both seem to boast fair con-
trol as their chief found asset, while
Haluska, unusually short for a pitch-
er, still manages to put a great deal
of zip on his deliveries.

The outﬁelders are still a puzzle,
weeding out being the chief problem
facing Mitterling. From a lengthy
list of candidates, ﬁve or six men
must be chosen with Milt Ripp fair-
ly sure ofione of the spots.

Back from the Butler Relays, the
Pitt track team gets a rest from var-
sity competition until April 15 when
the University Handicaps are sched-
uled at the Stadium in the season’s
first outdoor meet. A week later
Temple opens the Pitt dual season
on the Stadium track.

The Panthers, as a team, weren’t
exactly the stars of the Butler meets
last Saturday but in several events
the Oaklanders turned in above par
performances.

Only one ﬁrst was recorded by the
Gold and Blue runnersand that, as
usual, was credited to the crack mile
relay quartet, running against such
topnoch opposition as Michigan and
Ohio State.

Frank Ohl, lead-oil’ man, jumped
away to a ﬂying start and gave the
Panther thinclads a slight lead. On
the exchange of batons, Farrara in-
creased the gap between Pitt and the
nearest rival. However, Al burned
up his reserve too early and when
Gtaf received the baton, he was two
yards behind the leader.

Graf proved his ability at this point
by regaining the lead from Michigan
and had picked up a two-yard lead
when “Long John” Woodruff took
over. Woodruff stayed out in front to
the finish and the winning time was
3220.8.

I-leaving the shot put 49 feet, 10
inches, Pitt‘s John Bazk placed sec-
ond behind Watson, Michigan col-
ored ace who was the outstanding
man in the meet.

In addition to his shot put win,
Watson placed ﬁrst in the broad
jump with a leap of 23 feet, 10 inch-

 

es. a foot better than defending
champion Frank Ohl. Ohl ﬁnished
fourth.

Other Pitt athletes to place were
George Clifton in the pole vault and

sophomore McDowell in the high
Jump.

quesne just have to ﬁnish their
1938-39 hockey series. Like Ten-
nyson’s “Book” and Glenn Cun-

ningham, it seems to go on for-
ever.

The boys will be at it again to-
morrow evening and, should Pitt
win, another game will be played
some time next week. Reason: after
the Dukes won the first playoff, 3-2,
Monday night, the two clubs return-
ed Wednesday and after 115 minutes
of the longest hockey game ever
played at Duquesne Garden, the
match was stopped with the score
deadlocked at 1-1.

EVEN GAME

All in all, it was the most even
game played here this year. Pitt
had 15 penalties for 17 minutes while
the Dukes were chased into the box
14 times for a total of 18 minutes.
The rival goalies, Ellis and Lunger-
ich, had 62 and 64 saves respective-
ly.
Harry Foster scored for the Dukes
in the second minute of the second
period and Clyde Shiring equalized
at _the start of the third frame. From
then on, it was merely a matter of
endurance.

EXTRA SESSIONS

-A 10 minute overtime followed
the regulation three periods, then in
painful succession, came four 15
minute “sudden death” sessions.

The Panthers came back on the
ice to play a sixth overtime but a
conference involving the coaches, of-
ficials, and a few other people re-
sulted in a decision to call the whole
thing off and play again next week
if necessary.

Probably, Pitt was the fresher
team at the finish, for while the

The Duquesne score came, as did
the Panthers’ initial tally Monday,
at the start of the second period.
Bill Vance skated into the right cor-
ner of the Pitt defense zone, drew
three or four Pitt men his way, then
slid a perfect pass across the goal
mouth to Foster who batted it past
the helpless Ellis at 1:51.

Shiring’s score flashed the light
at 1:35 of the next period when he
blazed the puck past a group of Du-

Nominating candidates on the ba-

sis of merit, thirteen men's social

fraternities organized their coalition.
Wednesday night and arranged the’
nominees slates for the spring elec-T
John Downie,§

tion, according to
BA39, Delta Tau Delta.

. . , i
Besides arranging slates, for the.
usual spring elections, the fraterni-I
ties introduced the merit idea into:
A. 1
L0 ;

IF council and have arranged
have candidacies for that group
passed on for fitness by committee
of the council and members of the
dean of men’s office.

GRAPEVINE REPORTS

A steering committee including
Jay Reich, C39, Pi Lambda Phi; Bill
Edmunds, M39, Phi Gamma Delta;
and Downie, has been set up to han-
dle the executive work, but actual
control of the plans remains in the
hands of the fraternity caucus.

Beyond the change to the merit
system of nominations, no other part
of the party platform has been ar-
ranged as yet.

Meanwhile grapevine reports
clude:

Prior to the Wednesday night cau-
cus, the fraternities had had a hectic
time since their original caucus last
Sunday afternoon, and rumors of
new rifts were current every day.

N O COALITION

At one time a group of eight
houses were in touch with indepen-
dent leaders and were arranging a
coalition similar to the one that oc-
curred last year. The arrangements
fell through due to inability to de-
cide on the CA nominee, and to_ the
fact that the independents were un-
willing to give up their strongest
candidates to run. on a combined
slate, as well as to the fact that
both independent and fraternity
party unity was threatened by the
deal.

Rare Marica   

By Phyllis Cohen
Mrs. C. V..Starrett, assistant pro-
fessor of English, has a rare plant in
her office in the Cathedral.

Familiarly known as Marica—the
Mysterious, because its bloom is so
mystifying, this Brazilian Marica is
an unusual plant. It is especially
interesting, since its bloom gives the
appearance of a miniature orchid.

Some morning late in February, a
mid suddenly thrusts itself out near
the tip of what appears to be an or-
dinary leaf. The leaves are sword-
shaped, and there is a superstition
that the plant doesn’t bloom until it
has developed at least 12 sword-
shaped leaves. It takes several years
to acquire enough strength to bloom.

A half hour later he petals spread
and the ﬂower is in full bloom. The
ﬂower itself has no stem, emerging
directly from the leaf.

Coloring is most vivid, ranging
from white to blue or violet, with
brownish purple in the center. The
standards are curled in large, wide-
sweeping falls. From the center of
the ﬂower, the stamens are thrust
upward like a cluster of spears.

The Marica is a thirsty plant, re-
quiring much water, especially when
it is in bloom. But it is an easy plant
to raise, since it can endure steam
heat and sudden changes in temper-
ature.

By seven o’clock in the evening,
the blossom has curled up into a tight
ball and died.

The l‘-.Iarica owned by Mrs. Starrett
is ap-proximately four years old. It
was given to her this winter by her
mother-in-law, and already it has
bloomed twice since

until Easter.
