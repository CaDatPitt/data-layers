  Alpha Phi Alphacelebrates 100 years on Pitt’s campus

Kathleen Fennell
Staff W rzfer

Alpha Phi Alpha’s Omicron Chapter,
Pitt’s ﬁrst officially recognized mi-
nority group, celebrates 100 years of
achievement and diversity this week-
end with a variety of events focused
on honoring the past and encourag-
ing diversity. .

The Omicron Chapter was th
14th of its kind to be established, but,
nationally, Alpha Phi Alpha became
the ﬁrst intercollegiate black frater-
nity when seven men at Cornell Uni-
versity originally founded it in 1906.
Today, there are eight active members
on Pitt’s campus. Members of the
Omicron Chapter say this weekend’s
celebration, which includes the grand
opening of an exhibit commemorat-
ing their 100 years on campus and a
Centennial Ball, will leave a lasting
legacy on Pitt’s campus.

Matt Sauers, current president of
Alpha Phi Alpha’s Omicron Chapter
and a senior ﬁnance major in the Col-
lege of Business Administration, is
proud “of Alpha Phi Alpha’s past role
in aiding minorities on Pitt’s campus.

“There’s a lot of pride that comes
with being the ﬁrst minority organi-
zation on Pitt’s campus,” Sauers said.

Among the alumni of Alpha Phi
Alpha are Martin Luther King Jr.,
Supreme Court Justice Thurgood
Marshall and W.E.B Du Bois. Speciﬁ-
cally within the Omicron Chapter,
alumni include John Woodruff, an
Olympic gold medalist, Chris Dole-
man, a member of the NFL Hall of
Fame, and Mal Goode, an ABC News
correspondent.

“It’s amazing, the legacy that’s
been left behind. We’re really trying
to recognize that  no matter what in-
dustry it was, if there was an African-
American male doingwell, it seemed
like he had one tie or another to the
fraternity,” Sauers said.

Over two years of planning and

the work of just under 40 brothers _

have gone into makingthis weekend
possible. Sauers wanted to invite the
community to experience the event
with Alpha Phi Alpha.

“This is somethingwe really want
to share with the entire University.
This isn’tjustfor brothers of the Omi-
cron Chapter. It isn’t just for broth-
ers of Alpha Phi Alpha. It’s really for
the University of Pittsburgh and the
greater Pittsburgh area,” Sauers said.

One of the weekend’s most her-
alded attractions is the grand opening

of the Omicron Centennial Exhibit,

SGB seeksaccess solution to online Readership Program

Mahita Gaj anan
Stqff I/Vrzifer

Afterbeing reinstated on Pitt’s cam-
pus last semester, the Collegiate
Readership Program’s problematic
dispersal system has yet again come
to the attention of the Student Gov-
ernment Board.

Since its inception on campus
in 2011, the program, which grants
students free access to The NewYork
Times and USA Today newspapers,
has run into several snags. SGB sus-

pended the program temporarily in.

January 2012 after learning that Pitt
community members not paying for
the newspapers, which is funded
through the $80 student activity fee
paid by non— College of General Stud-
ies undergrad students each semes-
ter, were picking up the publications.
The program was reinstated in April
2012 after the installation of swipe-
access lockboxes, but in September
2012, The Pitt News reported that
the lockboxes opened for anyone
with a Pitt ID. Now SGB leaders hope

to alleviate these concerns through a
renewed focus on ﬁnding alternative
funding sources for the Collegiate
Readership Program.

In a meeting held Thursday ‘

morning, members ofSGB met with
representatives Ian Dryburgh and
Laura Reino, from USA Today and

' The New York Times, respectively,

to discuss the Collegiate Readership
Program. With the representatives,
the Board members went over sta-
tistics from the past two semesters
and talked about different ways to
advertise aspects of the program.
Currently, aside from the hard
copies of the newspapers provided
in lockboxes campuswide, the pro-
gram offers online versions of The
New York Times and USA Today.
Each day, 260 Pitt students can ac-
cess The New York Times’ website
for a 24-hour period. An unlimited
number of PDF versions of USA To-
day are available to students online.
According to SGB president Gor-
don Louderback, the main focus of
the Readership Program this year

will be the push to move students
toward online reading because on-
line editions are cheaper and more
sustainable. Otherwise, the Board
will look into ways to spread the cost
of the program so that it won’t be
shouldered solely by Student Activi-
ties Fee—paying undergraduates. For
the fall semester of 2012, the Read-
ership Program cost about $19,000,
Louderback said.

SGB member David Rosenthal
said the Board had to employ better

advertising and marketing tactics to .

raise awareness of the online edi-
tions. The instructions to access The
New York Times and USA Today are
available on the my.pitt portal.

“I haven’t heard of a lot of stu-
dents utilizing this service,” Rosen-

_ thal said.

Rosenthal acted as SGB liaison
to the representatives and said he
thinks the Readership Program is
beneﬁcial to the student body.

Current ideas for advertising
online access include tabling to try
to talk to students directly and in-

structional Videos showing students
exactly how to access digital ver-
sions of the newspapers. V
But the SGB’s push toward digi-
tal copies of the newspapers has
brought about new challenges.
According to Rosenthal, any stu-

I dentlwith a Pitt email address —

which includes graduate and College
of General Studies students + can
also access the online editions of the
newspapers. Because the implemen-
tation of the online editions of the
newspapers is still in a trial period,
both newspapers are allowing the
University access to them for free,
Rosenthal said. But when the trial
period comes to an end,the Board
will have to ﬁgure out how to restrict
the online access.

He added that there was no spe-
ciﬁc end date for the trial period but
said that it would occur once student
interest in the program increased.

Board member Sarah Winston
declined to comment on the cost
of the program after the end of the
free trial period.

Louderback plans to talk to

« members of the College of Gen-

eral Studies Student Government
and the Graduate and Professional
Student Assembly to get them to
contribute ﬁinds and make access
to the newspapers equal. His will
be a continuation of former Board
Presidentjames Landreneau’s at-
tempt to gain extra funding for the
program last year.

Despite the new concerns, SGB
members say the implementation
of the lockbox system has yielded
noticeable results.

According to Rosenthal, approxi-
mately 75 percent of the newspa-
pers delivered to the University were
picked up during the fall semester.
Louderback said that the pickup rate
last spring was 86.7 percent,and he
pointed out that the percentage fell
after the implementation of locks
on the boxes. ‘

According to Louderback, the

Along with the IBWA, some

sota College Republicans attacked

Benedict, claiming it to be part.

of the free market system and,
therefore, a violation of Ameri-
can freedom.

But a campus—wide ban on
bottled water would not limit
people’s freedom to choose water,
because it would still allow access
to water at fountains and hydra-
tion stations throughout campus.
Rather, choosing to boycott bottled
water is an expression of freedom.
Bringing your own reusable bottle
to campus is a modern and simple
form of student activism against a
multi-billion dollar industry that is

harmful to the environment.

At ﬁrst glance, banning bottled
water might seem far less glamor-
ous than war protests or the Free-
dom Rides. The ban won’t make
Pitt into Madison, Wis., in the late
1960s, and none of us will sud-
denly become modern—day Ma-
rio Savios. But in a post-Citizens
United world, in which the actions
of the individual have been greatly
marginalized, joining the move-
ment away from wasteful bottled
water would be a meaningﬁil politi-
cal expression that would serve as
an example that college students in
this generation can be more politi-
cally active than simply buying a

’ pair of TOMS and calling it a day.

So sure, getting a green roof
on Posvar Hall or replacing the
10A with a ﬂeet of Toyota Priuses
would be a bit more impressive,but
banning bottled water is a signiﬁ-
cant and realistic way to make our
campus more environmentally
sustainable. Already, our Student
Government Board is working
with University administration to
encourage students use reﬁllable
water bottles by installing hydra-
tion stations throughout campus.
As students, we have started doing
our part by using the stations, and

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor, _

Upon my initial read of The Pitt News article about the Pennsylvania Organization for
Watersheds and River’s “River of the Year” contest, I was insulted by the characterization
of the Lackawanna River in Northeastern Pennsylvania. With a second read, I realized that
you were only comparing the Monongahela to the Schuylkill River.

Did you deem the Lackawanna River not worth a second mention?

As a Pitt student back in the early ’8os, I observed the movement to improve the health
of the Monongahela River to make it a destination. After years of seeing their city become
polluted, primarily by the steel industry, the citizens of Pittsburgh began taking their wa-
tercraft into the rivers and enjoying parkland riverbanks. I recall participating in a River

Regatta at Point State Park in a vessel buoyed by empty beer kegs strapped together by
fellow employees of a local restaurant. ‘

I also lived in the Philadelphia area for 10 years. The Schuylkill River is also great,

meandering through the suburbs, passing its spectacular Boathouse Row and the Phila-
delphia Art Museum, coursing through the city before emptying into the Delaware River.

The Monongahela and Schuylkill are already great. 1

So now it’s time for another river to have its renaissance — the Lackawanna River.

Please vote for the Lackawanna! Progress. is being made for this river, which, in" the
not-so—distant past, was considered a place to dump trash, discharge mine drainage and
collect sewage. A . _ _ _ ‘

The Lackawanna River is now ﬁsh-able, swim—able, hike—able and kayak-able.

The Lackawanna River deserves to win this award; the prize money will be put to good.
use. The Lackawanna can and will attain the same class as the aforementioned rivers.

  WRESTLING

After wake-up call, Pitt pre

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

Following its ﬁrst Eastern Wrestling
League loss since February 2009, the
No. 17 Pitt wrestling team will face a
huge challenge in No.2 Oklahoma
State this weekend. ‘
With seven ranked wrestlers —
six in the top ten—the Cowboys, who

arecomingoffabig18—12winoverNo. -
v 4 Iowa, will pose the biggest challenge

the Panthers have faced this season.

Despite the lofty team ranking and
many highly rated wrestlers belong-
ing_to its opponent, Pitt has focused
on improving itself in preparation

. for Sunday’s meeting in Stillwater,

Okla. With ﬁve ranked matchups at
this meet, the Panthers will surely
be tested as they take on the nation’s
second-ranked squad. ’ _

“We’ve just been focusing on the
things we need to improve on as a
whole,” junior Shelton Mack said.
“Making the adjustments we need
to help us become better wrestlers.”

Considering the team hadn’t lost
an EWL match since early 2009, it
comes as no surprise that the ‘coach-
es were disappointedin the team’s
performance against then-No. 24
Bloomsburg this past Sunday. How-
ever, the coaches hope that theloss
will be enough to wake up some of
theunderachieving wrestlers.

“The coaches gave a speech

Bloomsburg and our progress thus
far,” redshirt senior Zac Thomusseit
said. “They are really disappointed

team more accountable for the rest
of the season. So I think this will
help the intensity in the room and
tighten things up coming down the
home stretch.”

The Panthers know they can’t sirn-
ply move on from the loss. In order
to improve, they must learn from the
errors they committed.

“No one likes losing, but you can
always learn and build ﬁ‘om your mis-
takes,” redshirt junior P.J. Tassersaid.

Each wrestler will try to limit his
own mistakes, but many have also
been putting extra work into study-
ing ﬁlm in order to prepare for top-
ranked matches.

“Fve been watchingsomeﬁlmfor
the upcoming match against Okla-

V homa State,” Mack said. “Seeing how

[No. 5_]on Morrison] wrestles and
ﬁguringoutagame plan so I cancome
out on top.”

Mack, ranked 15th, will wrestle
in one of the ﬁve meetings between

ranked wrestlers when he takes on
Morrison.

Sunday’s heavyweight match will
be a top -10 matchup.’Pitt’s No. 9 Tho-
musseitwillmeethistoughest oppo-
nent of the year, No. 3 Alan Gelogaev.

Thomusseit doesn’t like to watch ‘

his opponents’ film and instead, pre-
fers to work on improving his own
mistakes.

“I really don’t like watching
ﬁlm on my opponents,” he said. “I
wrestle a lot better when I just go out
and work my game plan instead of
watching out for what the other guy
is going to do.”

However, he has spent time in the
ﬁlmroomthisweek because Gelogaev
has an atypicalwrestling style.

“But the Oklahoma State guy is
a little different than the rest of the
guys at the weight,” Thomusseit said.
“Heis a big, freestyle wrestler that
likes to hit big moves by throwing his
opponents. So I amwatchingﬁlm this
week to ﬁgure out a way to stay out of
his throws.”

Three more ranked bouts are
scheduled for Sunday. One of these
will be between Pitt's No. 11 Tyler Wil-
ps and Oklahoma State’s No. 3 Tyler
Caldwell at 165 pounds. Another, at
184 pounds, pits No. 14 Max Tho-
musseit of the Panthers against the
Cowboys’ No. 15 Chris Chionuma;

Lastly, Sunday’s biggest matchup
is scheduled for No. 2 Matt Wilps of

Pitt taking on No. 5 Blake Rosholt of '

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

Tllree teamstied atop conference standings

Nate Barnes
Senior Staff Writer

Through about two and a halfweeks
of Big East conference play, most
teams have played four or ﬁve games.
And only three teams remain unde-
feated in conference play. Two are the
conference’s heavyweights, Syracuse
and Louisville.

But the story of the Big East thus
far has been Marquette.

At this point, though, the league
has parity —— beyond the triumvirate
currently ruling the conference, no
other team has less than two losses
in conference play.

Here’s thesecond rendition of the
Big East Breakdown.

1. No. 1 Louisville (16-1, 4-0 Big
East)

Louisville jumps up this week
based mostly on its rise to the top
of the overall rankings. In their ﬁrst
game as No. 1 this year, the Cardi-
nals almost lost the ranking as UConn
held a 34-28 lead over Louisville at
the half on Monday, until it rallied in

’ the second halfto win. Rick Pitino’s
team will continue to become more

formidable with each game played by

Gorgui Dieng, who recently returned

from injury. ' ,
Saturday, the Cardinals take on

Syracuse at the KFC Yum! Center in
Louisville to determine who holds
early supremacy in the conference.

2.~No. 6 Syracuse (16-1, 4-0) I

The Orange rose one spot in the
overall rankings Monday, but so far,
they have played arguably the weak-
est conference schedule of any Big
East team. ’Cuse started with games

Oakland 2025 plan to leave lasting changes on neighborhood  

Pat McAteer
Assistant News Editor

A collaborative effort by some of
Oakland’s most prominent insti-
tutions could leave the neighbor-
hood almost unrecognizable to
current students who return to

V Pitt 13 years from now.

Spearheaded by the Oakland
Planning and Development Cor-
poration, whose headquarters‘
is located on Atwood Street, the
Oakland 2025 Master Plan is a
long—term comprehensive rede-
velopment effort focused on im-
proving housing, transportation
and greenery within Oakland.

Pitt students could feel the ef-
fects immediately because of the
plan’s renewed focus on battling
negligent landlords and a cracking
down on partying. A

According to the outline for
the plan, which is available on

the OPDC’s website, two of the

primary initiatives are providing
housing for “diverse new gener-
ations of residents who choose
to live where they work” as well
as community building through
“reinforc[ing] neighborhood
identity and increas[ing] social
capital.”

OPDC Executive‘ Director Wan-
da Wilson said the OPDC planned
to “massage the real estate mar-
ket” by discouraging property

One of the main portions of the Oakland 2025 master plan is improvement of transportation. Courtesy OPDC I

owners from converting homes
into rental units as well as incen-
tivizing families of professionals
in the area to move to Oakland.
Additionally, Wilson said, the
housing portion of the plan in-
cludes a renewed focus on ordi-
nance code violation enforcement

_ through the reactivation of Oak-

watch, OPDC’s neighborhood code
enforcement project. She added

that Oakwatch also plans to curb '4
the number andsize of parties --

particularly in Central Oakland.
While Wilson acknowledged
that Oakland will always have a
high demand for affordable hous-
ing for undergraduate students
from Pitt, Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity, Carlow University and

other local colleges, she said i
‘OPDC hopes to dive_rs_ify,_the.popu-W 0'

lationthroughout the neighbor-
hood."

“We hope to move the median
age up a little bit,” Wilson said.

Pitt Spokesman John Fedele
said in an email that the plan’s.
focus on enforcing ordinance
code violations and battling un-
safe behavior coincides with the
University’s._housing-—goals. But,
he said, Pitt’s main focus is on

expanding on—campus housing.

“The University has always
been concerned with the avail-
ability of safe, affordable off-cam-
pus housing,” Fedele said. “The
University focus on housing over
the last 15 years or so has been to
develop more on-campus housing
to meet the demands of incoming
undergraduate students.”

The planning stages of the ‘
Oakland 2025 Plan included res-
idents from North, South, Cen-
tral and West Oakland as well as
"Pittsburgh community leaders,
representatives from the local.‘
universities, local college students

‘ and private businesses like UPMC.

Fedele said that the University

was represented on the Oakland »

2025 Master Plan’s Steering Com-
mittee, which helped facilitate
grassroots organization among,
members of the community,
“The Assistant Vice Chancellor
for Community Relations served
as the University’s representa-
tive,” Fedele said. “The University
provided thecommittee with a

, variety of in-kind services, such as

providing meeting space through-
out the development of the plan.”

In addition, some Pitt students
participated in the implementa-

tion and public relations process,”

Websites can help students evaluate prospective landlords

Tegan Hanlon
Senior Staﬁ‘ Writer

As a Pitt undergrad, Adam Gorzel-
sky had landlord problems, and he
wasn’t going to just roll over.
Here and there, petty issues
bubbled at his Semple Street apart-
ment nestled in South Oakland,
and they eventually culminated
in a December 2006 boiling point.
Leaving Pittsburgh for the

, holidays, Gorzelsky, then a senior,

turned down the heat at his resi-
dence, only to return to a repair-
man and a cranked-up, 80—degree
thermostat. This led to exorbitant
costs paired with an indifferent
landlord.

“We asked, ‘Could you maybe i

help us out with this heating bill?’
and he said, ‘Absolutely not,”’ Gor-
zelsky, 27, recalled of the January
confrontation.

Gorzelsky’s is an off-campus
housing complaint swimming in

a pool of grievances about short-
term student leases and the land-
lords behind them. To meet these
concerns, online rating and survey
sites have popped up — one even

designed by Gorzelsky himself, '

who was propelled to give students
a voice after his less-than-pleasant
rental experience.

After the heating predicament,
Gorzelsky, who graduated from
Pitt Law School in 2010, taught
himself Ruby, a programming lan-
guage, and in June 2007 his web-
site, www.landorslum.com, went
live. The site allows users to rate
their landlords from 1, “slumlord,”
to 5, “great,” in categories such
as maintenance, availability and
friendliness.

“The hope, initially, in creating
it was to at least hold the landlords
accountable,” Gorzelsky said. He
worked with an ever-evolving
chain of volunteers to maintain

the website. “What we hoped to

do was not so much spotlight the
poor landlords, but spotlight the
ones that did a really good job.”

Originally aimed to serve only
the Pittsburgh community, reviews
on the website quickly expanded
to rentals in places as far as Ha-
waii and British Columbia after a
reporter from the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette highlighted the website for
a 2007 front—page story.

Now, almost seven years after
its birth, the website boasts more
than 6,000 users who have ranked
more than 800 landlords.

While Gorzelsky, an attorney in
Latrobe, Pa., admits that he hasn’t
looked at the site in years, reviews
continue to trickle in.

“I can’t think of a single re-
quest that wasn’t fulﬁlled within
a 24-hour span of time,” read one
posting regarding a North Oakland
landlord, submitted by an anony-

, ITIOUS 1.1561‘.

The positive reviews are coun-

tered by those of less-pleased rent-
ers, including a post addressing a

McKee Place apartment that states, .

“Yup. These guys stink,” and labels
them as ‘‘slumlords.’’ .
Similarly ..to the website’s cre-
ator, David Rosenthal, a Student
Government Board member and
central Oakland dweller, is well-
versed in the horror stories sur-
rounding never-returned security
deposits and landlords who show
up unannounced at apartments.
“You walk down the streets, and
I swear you can probably ﬁnd so
many violations ofhousing codes,

and a lot of landlords are shirking

their duties,” Rosenthal said.
Thus, Rosenthal has taken on
off-campus housing as one of his
SGB initiatives this term, hoping
to increase the advertisement of
services offered by Pitt’s Office
of Off-Campus Living, such as its
landlord reviews and seminars on

tenant rights (the next information

session will be held at 127.lNorthg
Belleﬁeld Ave. on Tuesday, Jan. 22
at 6:30 p.m.). ‘

“Pitt does already have its rat-
ing service, but it’s not really well-
publicized,” Rosenthal said, refer-
ring to the “Landlord Survey” on
Pitt’s Off-Campus Living website.

Students‘ must login using their
PittNet credentials to access the
results, a summation of data from a
survey sent out to more than 9,000
Pitt students annually in April or
May since the 2006-2007 school
year. « '

“We were receiving a number
of complaints from students about
the quality of housing in the mar-
ketplace‘, so we partnered with
SGB to develop a tool that would
allow students to know what other
students”experiences were with
regard to off-campus apartments,”-
Pitt spokesman John Fedele said

The creepy creatures that lurk ominously
inside closets and beneath beds are not
entirely fictitious.

While bed bugs and rodents grip adult l

homeowners with fright much like Sully
and his crew of havoc-wreaking mon-
sters from “Monsters, Inc.,” the patent of
their scariness lies not in their enormity
or ferociousness but in their subtlety ——
their capacity to hide in cracks and crev-
ices: dark recesses ofbox springs, behind
baseboards, in squeaking drawers and
tiny water pipes.

Bed bugs and rodents might frighten
renters, but they seriously affect a home.
With knowledge of these pests,_ how to
prevent them and the means to extermi-
nate them, residents can feel conﬁdent
in their home’s livability.

Though there is no complete defense

_system, there are simple and cost—ef-

fective pest prevention techniques. An
insect interceptor, which can be placed
beneath the legs of a bed, impedes bed
bugs’ journey toward a bloody meal by
trapping them in what “resembles a plas-

Todaro, an entornologistfor the Allegh-
eny County Health Department. _
Avoiding rats is a simpler task, root-
ed mainly in basic domestic upkeep and

maintaining a “comprehensive ‘effort to

eliminate the things that rats‘are attract-

ed to” such as food and garbage, Todaro
said. A f ' .
Since bed bugs depend on the. trans-

 hitch rides in their»prey’s coat pockets

Feared critters infest homes, best handled by professionals g

. or luggage, defense techniques are often

enacted too late, especially because the
infestation of an apartment could have
begun on a different continent.

When you have an infestation, how— ,

ever, one of the most obvious symptoms
exploits a singular flaw in the pest’s cam-
ouﬂage, something a homeowner can-
detect without seeing: odor. Bedbugs,
whose Latin name literally means “bug

of the bed,” smell sweet like berries while -

rats smell rank like ammonia, according
to the Centers for Disease Control’s web-

‘, site. These smells, coupled with a few

other telltale signs (small, reddish welts
for bedbugsj chewed wires ‘and small
holes in your house for rats) can indicate
that you’re housing some freeloading and

. destructive roommates.

Despite the negative connotations
that surround having a bug infestation,

bed bugs “have nothing to do with so-

cial class or cleanliness of the structure

where they are found, and ‘anything that ‘

produces carbon dioxide is a target,” said

Off-campus students take simple steps to save [money p  . .-

Natalie Daher
S tajj” I4’rz'ter

Early on a Sunday evening, Alicia Henry
returned to her freshman—year stomping
grounds to do some affordable laundry. As
a senior exercise science major, Henry ﬁnds
that the $1 Panther Funds swipe to clean her
clothes in the Towers laundry room is far
more thrifty than using the coin-operated
washers in her apartment complex.

For Henry, small changes to save a buck
such as these are helping her to grow into a
responsible adult. V _

“It’s little things that force you to grow
up and not have to depend on your parents
as often,” she said.

' Since parents generally handle the util-

ity bills at home, off-campus living intro-
duces students to an entirely new realm of
real—world duties. And aside from cheaper
laundering, ‘there are a variety of other
tricks that students can utilize to cut back
on spending. Additionally, students like
Henry show that learning money-saving
tactics can help with more thanjust keeping
wallets full.
' Megan Yarish of Forbes Management,
which owns both converted Victorian hous-
es and apartment buildings in Pittsburgh
neighborhoods such as Oakland and Sha-
dyside,,recommends that students be con-
scientious of how much heat and electricity
they are consuming.

“Some properties offer all utilities in-

cluded,” she said. “But if-you do need to save
on electric bills, keep heat lower, even if it’s
gas heat, because your thermostat usually
runs off electric, as well.”

Yarish noted that residents have the, op-
tion to call the electric company to get a re-
cord of how much electricity they are using
on adaily basis. — -

“[The electric company] can give you
a daily reading of your bills of how much
electric you’re consuming,” she said. “You
can correlate that with how much electric
you were using or how high your heat was
that day.”

Since there are fewer daylight hours in . .
the winter, electricity bills often peak as '

students generally turn on their desk lamps
earlier in the day.

“Do your homework at the library,” Yar-
ish recommended. “It” [also] does help, with
the studying to go outside the apartment.”

For times when leaving the apartment
or house is not a feasible option, Oakland
landlord Diane Datz advises not leaving
lights on in rooms that are not being used.

“If you’re home and you’re in your bed-
room studying, there’s no need for the
kitchen lights‘ to be on for four hours,” Datz
said.

Datz alsooffered a piece of advice for
weekends or nights away from students’
off-campus housing. She recommended
purchasing a timer and programmable
thermostat to control when the lights and
heat are on, even when students are away.

“Youvdon’t want to leave the house dark

if nobody’s there — that’s just for security,” A

shesaid. “But leaving a single lamp on rath-

’ er than an entire room saves a lot of money.”

In addition to the increased lighting

A required in the winter, the dropping tern- '
peratures are often coupled withlong, hot
_ showers. T ‘

“If you want to wash your hair twice a
day, you can only wash it once a day,” Datz
joked. A I

Cold water should also be used whenev-
er possible —.— when dishwashing, shower-
ing and especially doing laundry.

“Some washers have a setting — wash
cold and rinse warm,” Datz said. “I do al-

— most everything in cold water, even towels ‘

make it out ﬁne — using hot water is much
more expensive.” _
» Forstudents such as Henry who do their

laundry at the Litchﬁeld Towers and those ' ’

who use the machines at their apartments
or houses, it is always cheaper to clean
clothes in full loads.

“Some people want to [wash] three or

four items,” Datz said. “But Iwould wait for
afull load of laundry.” ' r ' "
When the end of the lease rolls around,
many apartment complexes, including Lo-
bos Management’s Bentley Apartments on
Fifth Avenue, require tenants to shampoo
the rugs. before leaving. Representative
Averill Blanchard noted that more afford-‘
able prices can be obtained when doing
business with particular companies.

“We have carpetcompanies that we do

-recommend, because they give better deals

because they are used to our company,”
Blanchard said. “They can usually get’ it

done for under $100.” > T

In some cases, off-campus living doesn’t
meanin an apartment with some friends,
but rather, at home with parents. For local
students such as -Ksenia Ermakov, com-
muting is the best option when it comes to

V saving money.'"As a freshman majoring in

rehabilitation science, Ermakov. opts to live‘
at home and make the _22—minute commute
to the University every day. '

Ermakov carpools every other day" with X

a friend, and they alternate who pays the $5
parking fee inalot they found nearby. ,. _
“It’s free to live at home, and it saves a lot
of money with the dorms,” she said.
When it comes to food, Ermakov tries

to ﬁnd friends with swipes who can bring --

herto Market Central or other dining halls
on campus. But she also enjoys B_ruegger’s
Bagels for an inexpensive breakfast» and
Qdobafor lunch. > ‘ ‘

“I have to eat, butl don’t go to Panera ev-

ery day,” she said. . p e I
The “need to ea ” mentality is also

shared by Henry, who has learned strate-
gies for thrifty grocery shopping and cook-
ing in order to eat in more than she eats out.

“But [cooking] takes away from things
I used to do,” Henry said. “Certain things
become more important than spending
money on alcohol and partying.” If

GOING MENTAL

How to rent an apartment that’s
good for your mental health

Tracey Hickey.
Columnist

Renting for the ﬁrsttime is intimidating. You
have to assess whether a landlord is trustwor-
thy, perform a rapid cost—beneﬁt analysis on
the size, location and cost of a place, decide
how safe the area feels and often get three or
more people to agree on a house or apartment
before somebody else closes on the deal.
Hopefully when you’re doing all of this,
you’ll be in an ideal frame of mind. But no
one is in an ideal frame of mind all the time.
Whether you suffer from a mental illness or
you’re just a stressed college student, one of

the best things you can do foryour ﬁiture self .

is to keep in mind the details that make your
life more bearable when you’re under a lot of
pressure and look at every apartment through
the lens of one of your bad days.

I don’t have any prescriptions foryou, only ’
recommendations. As with most things in life, I

money will ultimately determine where you
can live, and roommate situations are subject
to complicated social dynamics and the whims
of fate. That said, I know from experience
that things that seem like extras when you’re
healthy will become life-saving necessities
when you’re in the throes of mental illness,
stressed out, in the middle of a breakup or
whatever the unpleasant case might be.
Your physical environment is important to
your mental well-being, and this goes beyond
how much space there is and whether the
bathroom is tolerable. A lot of people ﬁnd
their mood affected by the seasons, and the
gloominess of long, dark Pittsburgh days can
be aggravated by a dimly lit apartment. How
big are the windows in this place? Are the

lights good? And if not, is it because of bulbs A

that can be easily replaced? Is there a ﬁre
escape, roof access or a nice porch that you
can rely on when you need some fresh air?

A Check in with yourself, and decide how
important it is to you that a place where
you’re living for a year looks nice or is in a
nice area. Think about the details. If you’re
moving in somewhere with hardwood ﬂoors,
and homeyness for you is synonymous with
carpet under your feet, you’ll need to invest in
throw rugs. If a place tl1at’s otherwise perfect
is intolerably dim, you might want to really
consider a light therapy lamp like the ones

they use to treat seasonal affective disorder. .

Think about your walk to campus. It’s ac-

ceptable when you’re feeling well — will it '

look 10 miles longer when you’re in the middle
of a depressive episode? Will that prevent
you from going to class? Does your path pass

anywhere near a bus stop? Be realistic;after '

living with yourself for at least 18 years, you
know whether living in Squirrel Hill willaifect
your class attendance.

For example, I personally try never to live
more than two minutes from a reliable food

source. I’m not talking Market District — CVS
or Sunoco will do — just as long as I can go
there at nearly any hour to buy milk, eggs,
soup and Easy Mac. Don’t get me wrong — I’d
rather not subsist on ramen and gas station
hot dogs. But I have occasional depressive
episodes, and if I don’t really cook, and I have
a breakdown while living more than ﬁve min-
utes from a convenience store or small‘ gro-
cery, I’ll eat nothing for two weeks but cold
pizza and shame.

Likewise, on—site laundry, which might
look like a luxury when you’re healthy, could
be the sole determining factor in whether you
ever have clean clothes next year.

No matter what your baseline level of men-
tal health is, probably nothing will determine
whether your renting experience is tolerable
more than the people you end up living with. I
personally recommend that anyone with de-
pression, no matter how introverted, should
try to live with at least one roommate, and the
roommate should be someone’ that person
can conﬁde in. You don’t have to live with
your best friend — and if your best friend is
pushy or overwhelming, you shouldn’t — but
you should try to live with someone you feel
comfortable telling up front thatyou have
mental health issues. It would also be ben-
eﬁcial if that person doesn’t overreact when
you’re struggling and will quietly check in
with you if you’ve been missing for days. If
you have depressive episodes with low energy,
you might beneﬁt from the positive peer pres-
sure of having other people whose lives are
affected by whether or not you get out of bed
and do the dishes. If you have social anxiety,
you should be able to ask that your roommates

deal with your landlord, repair people or cable l

company if the thought is making your throat
close up, in exchange for your doing an extra
set of dishes here and there. a

For that matter, how hands-on is your
landlord? Does he or she live nearby or (God
forbid) on the premises? I was told in no un-

I certain terms that you should never live with

your landlord, and I’ve never met someone
whose experience doing so was pleasant. At
the same time, you want your landlord to be
quick to respond if your heat doesn’t work in
the winter. And if you’re not assertive enough
to advocate that, you want to have a room-
mate who is. _

Likewise, clarify the procedure for your
landlord showing your house or apartment
.to prospective tenants. How much notice will
you get? Can you dictate times when_he or she
can’t come around? Decide well in advance
and agree on these terms with your room-

mates so you’ll be able to present a united .

front if your landlord starts traipsing in with
next year’s batch of renters without regard for
your feelings or privacy. I ' ’ ~

' IN MY OWN WORDS

Live on campus to  effort and  snooze time

Naomi Borrebach
Opzmons Editor

What’s more sad and pathetic than be-
ing an upperclassman in college and
wandering home to an apartment kitch-
en devoid of any food except ketchup,
questionable leftovers and stale cereal?
Being an upperclassman, living on cam-
pus, losing your ID and eating Easy Mac

‘ three times a day until you fork over $20
to Panther Central so you can ﬁnally go -

to Market and eat at the William Pitt
Union food court again.

For many Pitt students, past fresh-
man or sophomore year, college life
means movinginto an apartment close
to campus for the lucky, or a bus ride or
long walk away for the less fortunate.
However, some of us choose to stay on
campus — whether in on—campus apart-
ments, suites, or, in my case, Greek Life
housing — where getting to class only
requires waking up 15 minutesbefore
the hour'(or 10 minutes, on a lazy day,
or 5 minutes past start time on days
when I’m OK with being late).

There are a lot ofbeneﬁts to living on
campus as an upperclassman —— for ex-
ample, I don’t have to go grocery shop-
ping ifl don’t want to, I don’t have to

 

worry as much about safety issues as I

might have to ifI lived off campus, and '

Panther Central changes my light bulbs
—— plus, I really do enjoy living with my
sorority sisters. Living on campus as an
upperclassmanextends the (relative)
coziness and (possibly sheltering) safe-

Central, you don’t have to worry about
conserving water for the sake of spend-
ing less on your water bill. However, it
might come as a rude shock when, after
being sheltered by on-campus life, my
fellow on—campus dwellers and I have
to make our way out into the real world

ty and comfort of freshman year to the
rest ofyour college experience.

Some of the best parts of living on
campus include not having to negotiate
with landlords, manage bills, pay for In-
ternet and other things that I’ve heard
people have to do to “be an adult.” When

everything is paid directlyto Panther ‘

 

and rent our first apartments. Since one
of the main points of college is avoiding
the real world and adult responsibili-
ties, living on campus is prime.

I enjoy living on campus because I
get to live with a group of people I like
and because it’s extremely convenient.
But it’s not for everyone. For those who

want a taste of the “real world,” for
those who harbor resentment toward
resident assistants and security guards,
Panther” Central or authority ﬁgures, or
for those who want a large kitchen of
their own to cook elaborate meals in,
living on campus is probably not a good

_ ﬁt.

Another issue to consider is cost. In
general, living off campus is consider-
ably less expensive than living on cam-
pus, especially for those who a_re able to
split a house or apartment with room-
mates. Signing a contract to live in some
on-campus buildings requires students
to sign up for meal plans —— which, while
convenient, are certainly not the most
cost—effective way to eat. Those who
live in residence hall buildings, even in
suites with kitchens, such as Amos Hall,
must. purchase a meal plan; those in
apartrrient—style buildings, such as Bou-

V quet Gardens or Ruskin Hall, are not re-

quired to get a meal plan.

Although a lot of people move off
campus after . freshman year, remem-
ber that we have guaranteed on—campus
housingthroughijuhior. year — and the
convenience of living on campusmight
make it worth it. I ,

READERSHIP

' last spring count the number of papers
picked up over the span of 40 days, while
statistics from last fall count the number
of papers picked up over a span of 75 days.
SGB Board member Michael Nites said the
discrepancy in pickup days was a result

~“"of the program ending and then becom-
ing reimplemented last spring once the
lockboxes arrived.

Rosenthal, too, stressed that the 75
percent pickup rate is noticeably lower
than the pickup rate from last spring.

“That can be attributed to the boxes,”
Rosenthal said.

Currently, the newspapers are held in
locked boxes located in different areas
of the campus. To access a newspaper,
a student has to swipe his or her Pitt ID.

Board member Sowmya Sanapala said
the reduction in the pickup rate is a clear
sign that the lockboxes have been effec-
tive. Now, she said, the challenge is limit-
ing the access to these resources online.

“Since we’ve started paying more at-
tention to the program, we’ve been able
to tailor who the papers are going to,”
Sanapala said. “Now we’re looking to
make sure the online access to The New

York Times is restricted to undergradu-
ates only.”

Sanapala reiterated that the Board will
have to look into ways to share the cost
of the program. .

If that plan falls through, Louderback
said the Board members will look into
ways to make the lockboxes exclusive to
Student Activities Fee-paying undergrad-
uates. One way to do this will be to hook
the boxes up to an Internet line that will
determine whether the swiping student is
technically allowed to take a newspaper.

“We don’t want to close out access to
the graduate students and CGS students,”
Louderback said. “This is Plan B.” I

Dan Scullin, a senior urban studies major,
said that as an intern with OPDC, he participated
in sharingthe news of the plan with members of
the community as well as leaders oflocal institu-
tions. He added that one of his responsibilities
was creatingavideo of the Oakland 2025 Master
Plan’s launch patty.

Overall, he said, the plan beneﬁts members
of the Oakland community, young and old.

“There are a lot of good things in the plan
that I think can beneﬁt students and residents
alike,” Scullin said. 7

Members of the Oakland community also
served as contributors to the plan’s creation.

Hanson Kappelman, who lives at the cor-
ner of Fifth Avenue and Neville Street in North
Oakland, said his experience as a facilitator at
national issue forums and domestic speeches
drew him to the plan’s development stages.

For him, the plan represented an opportunity
to help others in the community where he lived.

“To a certain extent, where I live and howl
live is working quite well for me, but I’m aware
that there are people in Oakland for whom that’s
not necessarily the case,” Kappelman said.

In particular, Kappelman said, the need for a

' Port Authority bus route that loops through Oak-

land was of interest to him. But he also said that
the dichotomy between long-term and short-
term residents was a point of interest among
participants in the plan’s development stages.

He said some of these issues included the.

poor conditions that some students live in as
well as “disruptive parties and the illegal be-
havior they tend to foster.”

. Although the Oakland 2025 Master Plan was
unveiled Dec. 18, Wilson said its planning has
been in the works for more than two years.

Wilson said that in the spring of 2011, the
OPDC hosted a large-scale community event that
“kicked off the process.” She said this process
included a series of community dialogues, and
the information gained during these sessions

A was used during the planning sessions that be- I

gan in the summer of 2011.

Wilson said itwas important for every neigh-
borhood to have a plan to ensure that everyone.
“moved forward in the same direction.”

“You have to develop a set of strategies of
how you’re goingto get there and have everyone
on the same page,” she said. I

Freshman Grant Van Hom’s ‘parents presented
him with a choice before he began college this
year. The native of Penn Hills, a Pittsburgh sub~

 urb about 30 minutes from campus, was given

To the option of either living in the residence halls
zj or getting a new car. Van Horn chose the car.

Now, as a commuter student, Van Horn

, experiences both the beneﬁts and pitfalls of
;__f travelling to and from campus each day.

“Being a commuter changes how you feel

' about college. It feels like more of a job,” Van

 adifferent set of challenges than studentswho : »~ »

   
 

Horn said. 9
Students who make the daily commute face

call Oakland home. With traﬁic, parking and an
assortment of other obstacles, students who
travel into Oakland each day say the journey is
always unpredictable. But Pitt commuters often
identify their greatest challenge as connect-
ing to the Pitt community. Luckily, Pitt offers
a Commuter Student Program to foster this
connection. .

“They did little things to try and get com-
muters involved in school. and have events
where we feel like we’re a part of the university,”
said senior Matthew Plutt, a former student
employee for the program. A

The Commuter Student Program hosts dif-
ferent events such as movie nights and a Hal-
loween party. In the past, the program served
breakfast as well. It also offers a lounge inside

< Nordy’s Place in the William Pitt Union where

students can hang out in between classes.
Plutt used to be a commuter assistant and
helped organize those events. Other tasks
he took on as a commuter assistant included
making sure the commuter lounge was in good

~ working order, writingblogs about subjects that

might interest commuter students and offering
events in and around the city for commuters.
“We come to classes everyday and go home.
We’re not traditional students living in dorms,”
said Plutt, a commuter himselffrom near the
Waterfront shopping area. “Sometimes you
have to reach out to commuter students to let
them know they can get involved as much as
students who live here.”

Plutt said.;théit his ﬁrsfyearghe was riot in-
volved in school activities ibutwas morefcicused
on his grades. However, in his second year he
became a lot more involved in commuter eyents,

eventually attaining the position as the§com—

muter assistant and even joining the glee club.
“Once you take the first step and get involved
in things, it’s easy to meet people and get con-
nected and feel a part ofthe University,” he said.
Seniorjason Bigenho also got involved;in the
Commuter Student Program and was aj com-
muter assistant. Bigenho lived in Baldwin with
his parents for his ﬁrst two years of college, but
now lives on North Craig Street with friends.
“Getting involvedwith commuter programs
helped memeet a lot more people, and it-made

some really good friends.there;*’=Bigenlio said.

The Commuter Program offers students a
commuter meal plan as well as a locker in the
Cathedral to hold their books.

According to the Commuter Student Pro— I
grams website, lockers can be rented at a rate *

of $6 for one term and $3 for each additional
term. The meal plans offered by Pitt to com-
muter students are identical to that of students

living in apartment-style accommodations of- 7

fered by the University as well as students living
off campus. - , g

Pitt’s Commuter Student Program officials
directed all inquiries regarding the number of
commuter students at the University to Pitt
spokesman John Fedele, who was unavailable
for comment.

Before he was a commuter assistant, Big-
enho was not too involved at Pitt and said he
felt very disconnected from the school. Since
he became more involved by joining student

. groups including Circle K, Musicians United

Sounding in Charity and Model UN, he feels a
greater sense of belonging.

Like Bigenho and Plutt, Van Horn found his
niche at Pitt by participating in a club. '

To get involved, Van Horn joined the Pitt A

racing team. He indicated that getting involved
helped him meet people and feel as though he
is a part of the University.

“It deﬁnitely helps you at least recognize

' people on the street,” Van Horn said. “You don’t

' Pitt’s rating system is much more
lengthy than that of Gorzelsky. It’s a four-
tiered survey separated into categories:
landlord, apartment interior, apartment
exterior and overall student opinion,

adequate.” Students award their landlord
with a letter grade in each area.

As students get through each year
in college —~ and as their lottery
numbers for housing selection get
a teensy bit better —— their hous-
ing situation gradually changes.
First comes the jail—cell—sized dorm
rooms of freshman year. Second, the
slightly bigger digs Student Housing
coughs up. And then, it’s off to the
ﬁnal frontier: an off—campus house
or apartment. - '

Students all over campus put on
their big boy or big girl pants and
leave, the safety ofa security—guarded
dorm to set out on the mean streets of
Pittsburgh. With the lease signed and
a shiny new key in hand, they relish
in the sense of excitement that they
had been hiding since their moms
and dads kissed them goodbye on
the first day of college.

While it can be a very exciting
time, it’s important to remember
that “with great power comes great
responsibility.” What could be the
biggest responsibility of all? Properly
decorating your new apartment.

Decorating a new place might
seem overwhelming, expensive, or
strictly for those who aren’t plan-
ning on spilling Natty Light all over

the ﬂoor, but sticking to a few simple
rules makes the process quick and
inexpensive for new tenants. Putting
a little bit of effort into an apartment
can take itfrombeingatypical, dingy
college house to a new go—to hangout
for study sessions, pre—games and
dinner parties. After all, this is an
apartment, not a dorm‘room.vYou
aren’t a freshman anymore, so it’s

time to upgrade your decorating

game.
Before channeling your inner

interior designer, there are a few
things that need to be done. First,
measure. Don’t buy that big, moth-
eaten, but oh—so—comfortable couch
from Goodwill until there is an exact
record of the size of the rooms that
are being decorated. This will make
it a lot easier to single out exactly
how big or small the furniture and
appliances should be to make sure
everything ﬁts.

Another preparatory measure is
to read over the lease and see if your
landlord has any restrictions as far
as decor goes, such as nailing up any
pictures orposters, painting the walls
or applying any window treatments.

When all of the nitty-gritty is out
of the way, it’s time for the fun stuff.

pace with lively decor for less—than—average home

tral theme for each room. It can be
one ortwo colors, a general mood or
any other singular idea that sparks
your interest. Maintaining some kind
of theme throughout the room will
keep the decorations, and therefore
the room as awhole, cohesive.
Since the majority of the houses
and apartments in Oakland have seenk
better days, certain aspects of the
rooms are going to be less than stel-
lar. Cover up a dirty carpet with a new
throw rug, preferably darker in color
so it will cover up your own inevitable
stains. Target and Walmart have fairly
cheap rugs that will double as a good
focal point for the room, so check
out their websites for some options.
Other common victims of past
tenants are the walls. A bad set of
faded spots or water stains will take
a room from a cozy space to an asyas...
lum in no time. If your apartments
lease allows you to paint the walls,
think about putting on a fresh coat,
even if it is just on one wall. No matter
what the color, it will be sure to add
an unexpected touch to a bland room.
There are other ways to get
around the restriction of not splash—
ing a new layer of paint onto what al-
ready seems like dozens coated onto

of Pittsburgh. According to the CDC, bedbugs
do not spread diseases and — aside from
causing itching and loss of sleep —— are fairly
benign.

Rats, however, according to the CDC, can
spread up to 37 diseases, including salmonella.

“Any animal that is at home in a sewer”
—— one of the common ways a rat may enter a
home — “spreads bacteria and pathogens in
a house,” Todaro said.

Rats are attracted to wet and warm envi-
ronments and can ﬁnd comfort under kitchen
sinks and basements, entering through holes

as small as a quarter in a house’s foundation.

Instinct might instruct a rash and immedi-
ate removal of these pests, with home-safe bug
repellents, mousetraps, and some fervent vacu-
uming, but according to the Allegheny County
Health Department, athorough inspection and
removal of pests by a professional is the safest

way to thwart their spread and destructiveness.

Elizabeth Pabor, a Pitt senior, discovered
some rats living beneath her sink last year and
was “scared about her kitchen being sanitary,”
she said. In an attempt to exterminate the rats,
she purchased no—mess mousetraps, which
failed to help, and eventually she had to contact
an exterminator.

“If you have an infestation, contact your
landlord or professional pest control com-
pany,” Linnan advised.

Do—it-yourself techniques, including wash— ,

ing sheets, vacuuming for bedbugs and setting
up traps for rodents, are not thorough enough.

“It requires a comprehensive pest control
effort. In apartments and condos they are hard
to get rid of,” Linnan said.

The CDC suggests speaking to a landlord
so that he or she can inspect the spaces of all
adjacent neighbors. While getting rid of an
infestation can be difficult, professional pest-
control experts provide the best hope for as-
suring that your unwanted housemates are
gone for good. I

the walls. Urban Outﬁtters has awide selection
of wall—sized tapestries, ranging from forest
scenes to maps, all for under $40.

Now it’s time to consider wall art. Pictures
from high school taped to the wall in the shape
of hearts, stars, or the letters “P—I—T-T” just are
not going to cut it anymore. Sites like Etsy of-
fer custom artwork to put up, while sites such

as Pinterest offer DIY options for artsy types. '

If you happen to be dead set on sticking
with the picture theme, try attaching them to

a corkboard for a cleaner look or, better yet,
framing them. A popular trend in wall art is a
bunch of individually framed photos of differ-
ent sizes and styles in a common color scheme,
such as black, silver and white.

While dressing up the walls is relatively
simple, revamping a cheap piece of furniture
can be diﬂicult. Look into slipcovers to update
an old couch, and think about using some left-
over paint from the walls on awooden chair or
set of drawers.

As long as you stick to the central theme
of the room, whether that is blue and green,
“cozy” or “Star Wars,” everything will eventu—
ally pull together, and you’ll be the envy of your
friends in no time. ‘I

Although commuting has its setbacks, it also
has its perks. Accordingto Bigenho, commuters

maintaining close relationships with friends
from high school and more easily upholding a
close—knit relationship with family.

the idea of livingwith someone he doesn’t know.

_ “Iwou1dn’t do anything differently. I like my

Plutt said that living as a commuter was
his decision and one he made in order to save
money.

“At ﬁrstl hated it because I metall these kids

After a Saturday contest with USF, John

and a home contest against No. 1 Louisville.

A  ' In the last week, the ‘Scarlet Knights

knocked offSt.John’s on the road but came
home to suffer a loss from Cincinnati. Eli
Carter and Myles Mack are still scoring a
bunch, averaging over 29 points per game
between the two players.

10. St.John’s (10-7, 2-3) .

The Red Storm have been quite an in-
triguing team this season, highlighted lately
with wins over Notre Dame and Cincinnati.
But turning rightaround, St.‘]ohn’s also
dropped contests to teams such as Rut-

gers and Villanova. With the conference’s ,

second-leading scorer in D’Angelo Harrison
(19.8 ppg) on their side, the Red Storm will
have chances to win a lot of games — the
only question is if they can do it consis-
tently. ’

11. Villanova(11-6, 2-2) .

With Wednesday’s loss against Pitt,
Nova has now dropped two Big East games
in a row and‘after an away game against
Providence will face Louisville, Syracuse
and Notre Dame. Based on the stagnancy
displayed by the Wildcats’ offense Wednes-
day and their inability to get stops down

the stretch, Jay Wright has a lot of work on

his hands.
12. Seton Hall (12-6, 1-4) ‘ ‘-
Although likely to ﬁnish? as one of th

bottom-feeders, the Pirates have played '

some of the conference’s best teams very
well. For about 32 minutes, Seton Hall hung

around with No. 1 Louisville and recently ‘

lost to Marquette by only seven points.
13. DePaul (10-7, 1-3)

DePaul’s lone conference win came A
against Providence onjan. 5. Since then, the '

Blue Demons have lost two straight games
and will have an interesting matchup with
St. John’s on Saturday.

14. Providence (9-8, 1-4)

As far as the Friars are concerned, they
didn’t have the worst of weeks last week.
Providence picked up_a 12-point win over
Seton Hall and lost to Georgetown by only
nine points. Baby steps, right? -

: 15. South Florida (9-6, 0-3)

USF really hasn’t been in a position to
win a_Big East game yet, and that probably
won’t change, moving forward. Recently,

Louisville defeated the Bulls with a harsh .

26-point demolition. I
