UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Chancellor Suggests
Discipline,  No.t Code
As Cheating Solution

“Better discipline and supervision” were cited by Chan-
cellor David H. Kurtzman as an answer to the University’s
cheating problem. Dr. Kurtzman suggested this solution as
an alternative to the proposed honors code. ‘

Drawbacks to the honors code include putting. the stu-
dent “in the horrible situation” of having to testify against

those he sees cheating, Dr. Kurtz-
man pointed out. He also men-
tioned the size of the University
and the high emphasis placed on

grades as reasons why the code.

would not work. “The pressure
of ' the draft and admission to
graduate school almost forces one
to cheat,” the Chancellor reﬂect-
ed.

In lieu of an honors code, Dr.
Kurtzman recommended the use

‘or proctors. He suggested that

proctors be undergraduates as
well as graduate students, mak-
ing the position an honor instead
of merely a job.

The Chancellor noted that test
questions should be such that “it
wouldn’t matter if a student had
a book open or no ” but interpre-
tation of reading and lectures
should be required. I ' '

Dr. Kurtzman emphasized that
students should improve their

sense of honor even under the‘

present system, especially when
a dishonest grade will make an
honest one look lower by com-

‘ parison. Students owe it‘to them-

selves to report cheating and try
to get rid of it rather than to
cheat themselves, he added.
Chancellor Kurtzman did not
feel that an honors system was
necessary in the graduate schools
since “if a graduate students
does not know h'is work, he risks
failure in his profession.”

based on the acceptances from.

each area.

Programs like this are in effect
in many prominent state and pri-
vate universities throughout the
country. Nudelman emphasized
that such programs are often
very instrumental in the future
universitiy lives of the partici-
pants. High school seniors will
be able to get a better idea of
what the University offers, while
committee members will gain
new perspectives by meeting
with people from every school of
the University.

Several meetings have already
taken place. At one large local
. high school a party was given one

Sunday afternoon for all high
school students who had been ac-
cepted here. Afterwards Nudel-
man discussed the value of the
conversation and found that none
of the high school participants
were left with the feeling that
the University could be cold and
impersonal.
. Nudelman noted that the pro-
gram is supported by both the
former and new SG, the alumni,
the faculty, and the administra-
tion.

Applications for the committee
maybe picked up at the SU desk
and must be completed by Feb.
21. Students from all schools and
at any level are eligible if they
have a 2.0 QPA.

Question of M eth.od”—Pa.ge Four)

fall, resident‘ students will be charged a $40 per term increase in ’

This sets the total cost for room . '
and -board at $1,000 for two
terms of residency. _ '
‘The biggest single factor neces-
sitating the rent raises, noted
Smith, is the yearly rise in wages; .
Generally, these wages increase I;
ﬁve percent yearly. To meet the
rising costs, fewer maids also.
will be employed. ‘ z a

Smith explained that the maids ‘A
would clean rooms once every ‘
two weeks instead of every week. A -
Also, he announced that they‘ ‘
would not change bed linen but
would collect soiled linen and
leave clean linen for the student
himself to fix.

The change in fees, remarked .
Smith, adds up to a total that is
still less than that charged‘ at , 
many other schools. Syracuse and
Boston University, for instance, V"
charge a larger fee and provide
even less maid service, accord-

resident, students either rent  A
en from a separate business con-
cern or return soiled linen _to
some central point rather than
having it delivered to them.
When the decision on these ,,
changes was made, suggestions to ‘ 0
reduce more drastically the maid --
service and to institute the rent 
increase this spring were r,eject- *:
ed, said Smith. Personnel prob» 
lems and the lack of facilities in ..
the Towers for student pick-up .,
and delivery of linen made these.
suggestions impractical.
' Smith noted that there are no
indications of an increase in
charges for board. “Some would
have liked to increase this (board.
fees), butthis increase in room‘
rent is enough,” explained Smith.
The new rates are the ﬁrst i
change since the fall of 1966
when the present rates were
established. ‘

Exchange Program 

Pitt Students To Go South

An educational exchange with
Tuskegee Institute has been
scheduled between the YMCA’s of
the University and Tuskegee for
March 1-5. The exchange will pro-
vide students with a ﬁrst-hand
View of the southern Negro and
White communities since the
Federal Civil Rights Acts.

' Dr. Morris Berkowitz, sociology
professor‘ and advisor of the
group, stated, “The purpose of
this _trip is to expose northern
students to the conditions of

southern Negro in the South and‘
throughout the country. Particu-

lar attention will be paid to un-
derstanding the assumptions un-
derlying the education which the
Tuskegee Institute students are
receiving and the implications

this education has for the roles.

which these students -are pre-
pared to assume after gradua-
tion.” Through student-faculty
seminars and informal conversa-
tion at Tuskegee, “students will

be requested to compare this set
of assumptions and processes
with those underpinning their
own education at the University.’-’

The exchange also provides

plans to include a number of
elementary and high school stu-

dents from disadvantage neigh-

borhoods. A special program is
devised to expose the students to

different vocations and various
aspects of a college education.
Two seminars on Wednesday,
Feb. 15, and Feb. 22 in 151 CL
at 4 p.m. will provide prepara-
tion for the trip. The deadline
for applications has been extend-
ed to Friday. For more informa-

AMEN UNDER 25!

HenrykSzeryngPerformsTschaikowsky

by ADRIENNE MILLER

This Friday evening, un-
der the direction of the in-
ternationally famous Italian
conductor, Carlo Marie Giu-
lini, Henryk Szeryng will
perform T_schaikowsky’s Vio-
lin Concerto in D major.

“Barbarously terrible" was the
evaluation of Tschaiko-Wsky’s ﬁrst
and only violin concerto after its
premiere in 1881. Although
Tschaikowsky dedicated the work
to Leopold Auer, the most ac-
complished contemporary violin-
ist in Russia; Auer refused to

‘ play it on the grounds that it was

too diificult.

Two years later, Adolf Brod‘-
sky, a young violinist‘ on his ﬁrst
European tour, presented the con-

certo in Vienna. Brodsky -received
a warm reception, but the com-
position met with cat-calls" and
scorn. “The violinist A. Brodsky,”
wrote one critic, ‘—‘was ill-advised
to make his ﬁrst appearance be-
fore the Viennese public with
this work. The Russian composer
Tschaikowsky certainly possesses
no commonplace talent-but rather
one which is ‘forced. Laboring af-
'ter genius his results are taste-
less and lacking in discrimina-
tion.” a;
Tschaikowsky was heartbroken.
One month after this disastrous
premiere he wrote-—“This season I
have no luck. The Maid of Orleans
(ballet) Iviéili not be given again;
Onegin. (opera), ditto; Auer intri-
g11eS~.ag“tV!¢,i;1s:t.‘ﬁt.hve Violin Concerto;
no one plays’ the (second) Piano
Concerto; in short,‘ things are bad.

Undoubtedly, I should have gone
mad but for music. Music is in-
deed the most beautiful of all
Heaven’s gifts to humanity wan-
dering in darkness.”

Leopold Auer ﬁnally attempted
the concerto in November, 1893,
15 years after «it was completed.
Auer was so enthused b-y'the re-
sults that he insisted of teaching _f
it to all of his pupils, including '
J asha Heiﬁtz, Mishe ‘Elman, Na-
than Milstein, an_d Efrem Zimbal-
ist. Alas,. Tschaikowsky did not
attend this successful concert for
Auer’s performance was a me-
morial to the composer's death.

Today this same violin concer-
to ranks with the most popular
and beloved compwitioiisi This
popularity makes it easy to for-
get that the concerto is as diffi-
cult as it was when Auer ﬁrst"

  

 

refused to perform it.

This will be Henryk S;eryng’s
ﬁfth annual appearance with the
Pittsburgh Symphony. If his per-
formance of the Tschaikowsky
Violin Concerto this year equals
that of the Beethoven last year,
the concert will be magniﬁcent.

Method  youc.nR......

Anyone who believes that he is attending a great institution would
naturally want the most qualified‘ students to.be admitted to his school.
Recently the University at the suggestion of Student Government decided
to allow students to participate in the process of freshmen recruitment.

The administration hoped the students would help in the establish-
ment of Secondary School committees in their home towns. These commit-

tees would meet with young people who have applied here. The members

of the committee would speak to these potential freshmen about the advan-
tages -of attending Pitt.

iTo our mind, if a Pitt student had time to participate in no other
activity, he should find time to work on this program. With the Admis-
sions Office flooded with appl-icationis it is impossible for University
officials to meet with prospective students and answer all of their questions,
The need for the Secondary School Committee is obvious.

_ When the Committee recently asked for students to participate only
nine people bothered to sign up, This is a disgusting turn out considering
the importance of this project.

Two hundred people are needed to make the School Committee project
_a success, If the administration were to say now that students cannot
take on responsibility when handed it, they would have just cause for such
statements. Let’s show the University community that We as students are

capable of serving and strengthening our alma mater.

Do We Want To Fight Poverty?  

By Hobart Harris

lem. American papers would
pick up the story and soon a
new and cry would spread

across the country. In no ‘

time at all, poverty would
suddenly ‘become important
again.

The Great Poverty Race———
why not? It is a sad com-
ment on any culture when
such things should even be
joked about, but anyone who
has followed the behavior of
this country the last ten
years or so knows that it
certainly won’t be accom-

seems such a shame that we
have ﬁnally gotten to the
‘point where we can afford
to make this country a de-
cent place to live for all of
its citizens and then choose
not to. We all deserve peo-
ple like Ronald Reagan and
his tuition increases; it is
inexcusable that only the
poor must suffer from such
abominations.

Student Criticizes
SGAs‘Inefficient’

Editor, The Pitt News:

I have heard many criticisms '

of the Student Government (SG)
during the recent campaigns, but
nobody has ever come to the real

reason that SG is poor. It’s in-
A efficient government is no gov-

ernment at all. The SG activities

. are well advertised, but poorly

executed. I will agree that a few
_-mistakes are excusable, but too

— many amount to incompetence.

You question the cause of stu-

dent apathy? The students are

slightly soured on their univer-
sity. If the government can gov-

_ ern half-heartedly, the students

can cheer «half-heartedly. Then

they wonder whythey don’t have

any fun at sports events if they
ai'en’t drunk. They get the wrong
idea of school spirit, associating
it with a giant beer_ mug.

But back to this monster of
ineﬁiciency which we call the
SG. During the Book Exchange,
I left aifew books in the care of
the SG. I came back a few days
later and was informed that I
must return in still a few more
days. I came back and nobody
was there. Now after trying re-
repeatedly for two weeks to get
into Room 320, I was told that I
couldn’t get my money because
the slips had probably already
been destroyed. The Book Ex-
change‘ is supposed to offer a
service, but if I had wanted to
throw money away, I'd have done
it myself. A concerned govern-
ment would have discarded only
the paid slips, and contacted
those who hadn’t come around
for their books or money. This
would ‘have taken very little
time and no money. Oh, you say,
we shouldn’t expect this of a
government which has so much
else to do. Well, isn’t. this the

least they could have done? Af-

ter all, the money that the ‘stu-

-dents didn't pick up was chan-

neled into a student activities

I Recommend Abolition of-Draft

Student Leaders Meet In New York

Cr

:

..$

 

Leaders of 15 student or-
ganizations representing
both political extremes call-
ed for the abolition of the
draft and the encourage-
ment of voluntary service in
humanitarian pursuits at a
conference. held Sunday in
New York city.

The student leaders included
members of the Students for a
Democratic Society, Young Amer-
icans for Freedom, and the Youth
and College Division of the
NAACP. The conference was
sponsored by Moderator, a na-
tional student magazine.

The resolution read: “The pre
sent draft system with its inher-

ent injustices is incompatible’

with traditional American prin-
ciples of individual freedom with-

in a_ democratic society and . . .
for this reason the draft should
-be eliminated. An urgent need
exists within our society for

young people to become in the _

elimination of such social evils as
ignorance, poverty, racial dis-
crimiination and war.”

The 15 student leaders said
that while they believed the res-_
olution reﬂected in many‘ cases
the opinions of their member-
ships, they had signed the state-
ment as individuals and not on
behalf of their groups.

Gregory Calvert, national sec-
retary of Students for a Demo-
cratic Society, said he opposed
the draft because it provided the
military manpower necessary‘ for
“American imperialism and an‘
aggressive ‘foreign policy abroad.”

David Franke, editor of the
New -,,Guard, __a ‘publication of

Young Americans for Freedom,
said he wanted -the draft elimi-
nated because “it’s against in-
dividual liberty” and is “one of
the most totalitarian measures
on the books.

Unlikb Mr. ‘Calvert, Mr. Franke
said he favored American in-
volvemeht in Vietnam.

Mark Roseman, director of the
Youth and College Division of
the NAACP, said that while he
had some reservations about the
abolition o-f conscription and total
reliance on voluntary armed
forces, he was opposed to what
he called the inequities of the
current draft and thought that a
system of voluntary national serv-
ice would be “much closer -to the
American ideal than our present
system.”

Playing a tight defense and a ball con-
trol’ offense, the Panther basketball team
gave West Virginia a near-scare Monday
night in Morgantown before succumbing, ~

81-62.

The Mountaineers have only lost once

on their home court in two years and’ des-
pite a stubborn eager effort, WVU wasn’t about to
lose twice. After leading at halftime by seven.,
31-24, West Virginia gradually expanded their edge
to 13 points, 50-37, and won going away at the

end.

At the same time", the cagers were working the
ball for the good-shot. Making the shot good was
‘another matter. The Panthers simply missed too
many opportunities to pose a serious threat.

Len Kalata and A1 DiFrischia were the chief
Jffenders. Kalata hit on two baskets in 14 tries,
and DiFrischia wasn’t much better with two ﬁeld

goals in 11 attempts.

On the plus side for the cagers was the shoot-
ing of Pete Smith and the work underneath the
boards of Jim LaVal_ley. Smith tallied consistently
from outside, ﬁnishing the game with 19 points.
LaValley, locked in a tough physical struggle with
WVU’s Carl Head and Bob Benﬁeld, scored 14
points and pulled down 12 rebounds.

Panther coach .Bob Timmons had instructed his
team before the game to use a semi-freeze, hoping
torattle WVU and force them into mistakes. His
strategy worked, especially in the ﬁrst half. The
Mountaineers turned the ball over nine times be-

Ken Bollens got into, foul trouble early, and

as a result, the Panthers’ second—leading rebounder
couldn’t provide LaValley with much support. Bol-
lens eventually fouled out, as did Steve Steven-
son. After scoring 25 points against Fordham, Bol-
lens contributed but three against West Virginia.

On defense, the cagers effectively shut off the
Mountaineer fast break, a feat they couldn’t ac-
complish in the game at the Field House. In com-
paring the two games, Panther publicist Dean Bil-
lick felt that the cagers “played much more re-
spectably in Morgantown. They got back real fast
to stop West Virginia’s offense. If they hadn't, it
could have been a 40 point rout.”

RON WILLIAMS led the fast-breaking West Vir-
ginia Mountaineers in a route over the Panther
quintet Monday night in Morgantown.

The Panthers were able to maintain ball con-
trol despite the ever present full court press em-
ployed by WVU. In fact, early in the second half,

the cagers cracked the press for a couple of easy

E-6 Staff Sergeant»Troy ‘Kelley -bucked the higher-ups
and got what he wanted. -Now he wants to tell everyone

about it.

For embedded in the far, dark reaches "of Trees Hall, an unknown
underground fortress guards what he has fought for six years to
build. It’s a riﬂe range and now he won't be stopped in his attempt
to publicize Pitt’s one and only varsity riﬂe team.

Shooting, a sport unto itself, was revived at Pitt by Kelley in
1960.‘ His team had operated as a club in the Western Pennsylvania
Riﬂe Association, and just this year, it became a “varsity sport.”

Before it became a varsity team, the group’s early history paral-
led the movements of a nomad tribe. In 1960, the team ﬁredunder

by ROY JACOBS
Sports phenomena tend to
run in cycles. One year might
be a big year for quarter-
backs or for base stealers.

The next year might be a
big year for halfbacks or for
power hitters.

In wrestling, this is a big year
for 130 pounders. And Larry Cuba
is ﬁnding this out the hard way.
Cuba is a sophomore wrestling
in the 130 pound class for the
varsity. In six dual meets. so far
this season, he’s only managed
one win—a pin against St. Fran-
cis.

It’s just that each time he goes
out on the mat, Larry knows he’s
facing one of the best..He’s al-
ready wrestled against the likes

' of Don Milone of Temple and

Gary Fowler of. Army, and the
toughest is probably yet to come
when he faces either Mike Caru-
so or Joe Peritore of Lehigh.

But Cuba’s prepared himself
for the worst.

“When I started wrestling this
year, I didn’t expect to win all
of them or even most of them.
But I didn’t expect to draw so
many tough guys.

I’m glad I’m wrestling for the
experience I’m getting,” he con-
tinued. “As they say, experience
is the best teacher, and I think
the only way to wrestle _well is to
wrestle the better guys.”

Still, a 1-5 record is not some-_
thing that is easily rationalized
away. Cuba makes no alibis. '

“I didn’t expect to be doing
as poorly as I am. I’m almost
completely dissatisﬁed with the
Way things have turned out.”
Everythingstarted out ﬁne this
season andswent well until he-
injured his shoulder in practice
against Rich Shildt.‘

“The pin against St. Francis
gave me conﬁdence,” he explain-

ed. “I hurt my shoulder after

Navy, and since then I have no
confidence when I’m on my feet.”

Cuba explained that his injured
shoulder hampers his takedown
style, and he favors the shoulder
because it pains him when he’s
involved in wrestling when stand-
ing. To compensate for his weak
arm, coach Dave Johnson ' has
started him working on take-
downs to the opposite side.

“After the injury ﬁnally clear-
ed up, I ‘found that I had lost

  

able to start strengthen’ it this
week.”. He goes on, “I 'nk the
coach understands that my shoul-
cler bothers me. He keeps telling
me to remember ‘your sophomore
year is a year of experience.”
Cuba speaks about the future
a little more enthusiastically.
“I’ll probably be at 130 again.
The competition should fall off a
little, and I’ll be that much bet-
ter.” He adds, “Things won’t be

4. They are decadent, degener-
ate, and morally corrupt. Many
children of rich families play
truant the whole day long and
spend their time in clubs drink-
ing, merry-making, and indulging
in orgies of debauchery. Some of
them even operate clubs them-
seves so that they can loaf all day
long. A Harvard University stu-
dent went so far as to opennly
bring in a group of prostitutes and
run a brother inside the school.
To girl students the Harvard cam-
pus means a prohibited area to
be dreaded. Unescorted girls dare
not walk on it. It has been the
scene of robberies, molestation
and all sorts of bad things!_

At the American Massachusetts
Institute of Technology there is
by tradition a bad custom of
ragging new students. It is per-
fectly legal for senior students to
humbug the newcom_e_rs.iA “school
regulation” is in force whereby
a student, having just entered
the school, is blindfolded, taken
to the suburbs, and then allowed
to grope in the dark for his way
home. It was in this Way that a
new student once fell into a hole
of frozen water and got drowned.
And, in the view of many senior
students, this innocent boy who
had lost his life “deserved it!”
This bad custom of ragging new
students, called “dragging the
corpse,” is prevalent in many
American schools.

Girl students in America are of

a lower class. Harvard Universi-
ty admits no girls but has setup
a separate institute for them. Su-
perﬁcially this looks like mere
segregation of girls from boys.
In reality it is discrimination
against the girl students. Large

 

Students Condemned

numbers of university girls study
domestic science. All day long
what they. study is how to marry
wealthy husbands of their choice,
how to manage their home af-
fairs, and how to help their hus-
bands climb up the ladder. These
represent the outlook on life of
many an American girl student.
Any Work Is Better
Than Teaching; One by One
Professors Switch to
Other Occupations

The poor academic results ob-
tainable from a university of this
description can be readily imag-
ined. The low standard of Amer-
ican education is really astonish-
ing. The death of teachers. is an
outstanding reason for this.

The professors in American
universities receive very low sal-
aries. Their pay is generally one-
third and even one-half lower
than the income of workers in

‘other social occupations. This be-

ing the treatment of university
professors, there is no need to

mention the salaries for second-

ary school teachers. When a sum-
mer or winter vacation comes,
the problem that worries the pro-
fessors most is how to make their
living during the long, long holi-
day. Many of them are forced to
change their calling to become
vwaiters, to toil as farm hands or
to act as circus clowns. Any
work is better than teaching; nat-
urally they have no heart for
teaching.-So strange are the edu-
cational circles in the United
States! University students are
being brought up only to become
waste products, and the teachers,
one after another, are switching
themselves over to other occupa-
tions. American educational en-
terprises are rotting!
