Details Surrounding Arrests Are Unclear

By MARK A. .S|NDl.ER

In the wake of ‘thearrests of two
football players early Sunday morn-
ing, numerous conflicting reports
and details surrounding the incident
are slowly surfacing. Already, the

’ two city newspapers have given dif-

ferent accounts of senior Dave Puz-

 

News Analysis

zuoli’s and sophomore Dennis
Atiyeh’s arrest around 2 a.m. Sun-
day. The local television stations

\have also released differing reports.

There has yet to be consensus on
when the arrests were made. When
the two players. were apprehended,
some reports said it was about 1:50

‘a.m.; others said 3 a.m. This is signif-

icant in that most bars in the Oak-
land area closearound 2 a.m., and
when thearrests were made, a very
large and, boisterous crowd was
attracted to the scene. If the arrests

occurred at 3- a.m., there would have

probably been few people on the
street.

On what street the arrests were
made is also a matter of controversy.
Although it is agreed that Forbes
Ave. was indeed the scene, it is not
known whether the intersecting
street ., was Oakland, Bouquet or
some other street.

Police were called to handle an
alleged disorderly conduct call. The
caller or callers mentioned.Zelda’s
Greenhouse as the place of inci-

dence. However, the exact location _

is still in question. When contacted
by The Pitt News, Charles Nucci,
owner of Zelda's, said the opposite
was true. '

“It happened nowhere near my
place,” Nucci said. “Someone called
and said that the whole thing
occurred in front of Zelda's; that’s
not true. Everyone's been calling me
and asking for the details, but I've
told them all that there wasn’t even
anything happening all night.

“In fact, we were closed already. I
was inside counting my money and"
didn’t hear that we were involved
until the news came on yesterday
[Sunday]."

Upon contacting a nearby bar, the
Sanctuary, The Pitt News learned-
that there has been a two-month ban
on football players entering the

Father Mulcahy Confesses All

By BRIAN BALK

When William Christopher set ,
foot on stage last night, he appeared
little like Father Mulcahy, the char-
acter he portrayed for l 1 seasons on
the television series M*A"'S"'H-

Dressed in a traditional suit and
necktie and without the wire rimmed
glasses for which he. is so well
known, his high-pitched, timid voice
was ‘the only characteristic that
remained of the preacher. -

It wasn’t until Ch/ristopher went
into a rendition of his life ‘as an actor
that the real character behind televi-
sion’s man of the cloth emerged.

“I’m not a real priest,” Chris-
topher said in front of the 700 who
were in attendance. “I just happened
to be at the right place at the right
time 11 years ago. *

Christopher first told of how he
got involved in acting. Many actors
start their careers as a secondary
character, but Christopher started '
as a groundhog. S

“I was a good groundhog——in fact
I was spectacular,” he admitted. “I
knew if I could be a groundhog, I
could be a good actor someday—my
plans started there.” '

As he reminisced about his colle-
giate days and his rookie acting
debuts, he began to undress. Under-
neath his traditional garb appeared
the black turtleneck, complete with

army fatigues, which made him one '

of TV’s most_ beloved fathers.

Once he was bedecked in his
familiar M*A*S*H apparel, he
jumped into a sermon. The sermon
revolved mainly around challenges
and what the future holds.

“My friendiexpressed words tell-
ing me that I’m not getting out oflife
all that I should,” Christopher said.

His sermon was filled with pro-
found thoughts and philosophical
ideals, but the actor in him still

showed vividly through. Through-

out his sermon, he made humorous
analogies that real priests would
rarely ‘make.

“Life is like a sardine can with
most of us looking for the key to
open it,”-’ he amusingly preached.
“There is always that little piece in
the corner that just doesn't come
out—just like life.”

After extolling enough moral
anecdotes, Christopher went into a
history of the M*A "‘S"'H series.

“We never expected M*A"'S*H
was going to work as well as it did,”
Christopher said.

Christopher explained that part
of M"'A*S*H’s success lies in its
depth. “We are not a flat show as
many TV series are,” he said.

“The most exciting part of doing
M*A *S*H is that we got to do the
wonderful detailed work that actors
love toido," he said.

Detailed work such as going line
by line through the script and spot
improvising were just parts of the six
months spent ﬁlming M"'A*S“‘H
each year. The series also gave each
character the ﬂexibility to develop in
the manner he chose, he said.

Unofficial sources claim that Puz-

Various reports claim that Puz-
zuoli was asked by police officers to
leave the Oakland area ‘on one or
two other occasions that evening.
Those same reports do not account
for Puzzuoli’s being asked to leave
or his acting disorderly. —
The only point about which all
reports agree is that both were heav-
ily intoxicated. Police at the No. 4

Subject Of

Complaint I

By CHRISTINA CLINTON S

l

A representative. from the Legal.

Awareness Committee i" planning
to file a complaint against Pitt’s
department of public safety because
of what he calls an “inadequate”
investigation by the department in

' regards ~to-.an.ass.a_u_lt incident that
— happened last year.  " ' 

James" Brady will be filing the

complaint sometime this week with

the assistant vice-chancellor of busi-
ness and finance John Vrana against
the entire department, not just the
police officer involved.

On Sept. 15 of last year, Lewis
Pearson, a Pitt student, claimed that
he was verbally_ and physically
assaulted by campus police officer
Vernon Barkley outside of Lothrop
Hall. ‘

Pearson, his brother Anthony
Pearson and a friend, Lyden Van
Johnson, were in Lothrop Hall and
creating a disturbance; they were
asked to leave by the desk attendant,
Mildred Olden, police reports said.

Pearson said they left the building _ T

when Barkley appeared and told
them to leave, but Barkleysaid Pear-
son became “verbally loud and
alarming to the public.” According
to.the report, when Barkley made
Pearson assume the search position
outside, Anthony Pearson and Van
Johnson grabbed him in an attempt
to free Lewis Pearson. Barkley said
this was when he arrested Pearson.

Pearson said, in a suit filed later,
that while he was leaving Lothrop,
Barkley began shouting at him in an
angry tone. After some words were
exchanged, Barkley ran up behind
Pearson with a night stick, grabbed
him and pushed him into a parked

car, Pearson said. In order to keep i

from getting hit, Pearson said he
ducked under the officer’s arm and
in the process struck him in the face.

Barkley grabbed Pearson again,
the suit said, and attempted to strike
him when his brother and Van John-

son pushed Barkley out of the way,”

freeing Pearson.

Pearson then ran down Fifth"
Avenue up to Darragh Street, and
Barkley caught up with him and

Details Are Unclear

when the person is driving a vehicle.
In trying to contact the arresting

officers, The Pitt News found that '

all were unavailable for comments.
One officer, Carl Metz, is off on sick
leave after appearing to be in good
condition on TV Sunday afternoon
on the corner of Forbes and
Oakland.

Reports detailing the condition of
injured officer DeVelma Coleman.
also differed as to her condition.
Some say‘Coleman suffered a frac-
tured spine in Sunday morning’s
scuffle. Others say that she is in
Montefiore Hospital with a broken
neck. Some say she is in stable con-
dition;others say she is in satisfac-
tory . condition. These are all
signiﬁcant differences in medical
terminology.

Meantime, the two players
involved are tight-lipped about the
entire matter and are awaiting their
March 2 preliminary hearing in the
Public Safety Building, downtown.
Both players are under orders from
their lawyers not to speak with
anyone.

However, Atiyen, a 6-3, 210-lb.
linebacker, admitted that he is sim-
ilarly confused about what is being
reported on his and Puzzuoli’s
arrests.

“I can't have no comment,” he
said. “All I can say is that the facts
they’ve been writing are mixed up.
My lawyer doesn't want me to say
nothing.

“It's hard to keep here and not say
nothing. After the preliminary hear-
ing, 1 might be able to say a couple
things and make a couple of
statements.” _

Before that hearing, Atiyeh did
say that he and Puzz_uoli would like
anyone who witnessed Sunday’s

incident to call the stadium office for ,

testifying purposes.

Once the players were arrested,
both were detained in the County
Jail until bail was posted. Charges
stemming from the arrests include
terroristic threats, obstructing traf-
fic, simple assault, aggravated
assault, criminal mischief and disor-
derly conduct. Each player was
charged with different counts for
each offense. ‘

Rumors have also been circulat-
ing that the incident was one of
police harrassment. An unidentifiet
source at the scene of Puzzuoli’s
arrest claimed that upon Puzzuoli’s
being led into a squad car, Coleman
brought her nightstick down over
his head and broke it. It was after
that happened _that Puzzuoli

allegedly threw Coleman against the [

car and injured her entire back.

managed to hit him with the night
stick, an act which required Pearson
to be treated at Monteﬁore Hospi-
tat, the suit said.

Barkley was once again held back
by Anthony Pearson and Van John-
son, and the three escaped to Monte-
fiore Hospital where they were
apprehended by Barkley, other cam-
pus police, city police and Montefi-
ore police. It was then that Pearson
was arrested by the campus police,
the suit said.

Pearson went before the Student
Judicial Board on Nov. 11 and was
found guilty of assaulting Barkley.
As a result of that hearing, Pearson

then filed a suit against Barkley
demanding his resignation from the
university.

William T_ucker, the director _of
the department of public safety, said
the incident was going to be treated
as an i-nternal police matter and the
department would investigate Pear-
son’s charges.

On Dec. 16, Brady, representing
Pearson, wrote a certiﬁed letter to
Tucker asking him about the status
of the investigation and’ why he or
his client was not-contacted about
the investigation‘. Tucker wrote a let-
ter to Pearson on Dec. 21 and to
Brady on Dec. 22 stating that the
investigation took place and Barkley
was not wrong in his actions towards

Pearson. But Brady said he is not
satisfied with that.

“I’m not saying that they didn’t
investigate, but at best, it wasn‘t an
adequate investigation,” Brady said.
“We suspected that when they said it
was going to be treated internally,
that it would be buried.”

Brady has sworn affidavits from
four of the five witnesses who claim

they were never contacted by the  ’

police when the department was
supposedly conducting its investiga-
tion of the incident. '
Tucker had no comment about
the complaint, but reaffirmed that
the department “found no wrongdo-
'ing on the part of the officer
involved.”

William Chris topherLo0ks At Life After M *A *3 *H  

1 By Tool: ERKEL

William Christopher sat.
. absorbing the rays of unexpected»

sunshine that came with the past
few days’ sneak preview of
Spring and expressed a ‘sense of
peace that he was ‘feeling about
himself and his work, Although
more imposing physically than
_ he appears in his on-screen
fatigues, Christopher ‘gave off
the same air of serenity he has

'5";/vtbrought to the character of

Father Mulcahy on the long-
running series M*A“'S*H. .

“Things have worked out well
for me,” Christopher said. “I
think I'm pretty much at peace
with the world.”

Christopher chose his words
‘carefully when he spoke yester-
day_ before his lecture at David
Lawrence Auditorium. His eyes
appeared creased with fatigue as
he recalled moments of the past
I 1 seasons at the 4077th as if they
had been ﬂeeting moments in an

 actual war.

Just as all of America’s
M*A*S*H faithful wait impa-
tiently to see next week’s final
episode, a two and a half hour
special that will mark the end of
both the series and its subject-
the Korean War—Christopher
himself wondered how» the end
would look, having not seen

’ﬁ1ﬁ5H"(")'f the“fi1tale.j-»~ 

“I’m looking forward to seeing ’
it," Christopher said. ‘‘It’s my
hope that it will turn out as excit-
ing and good as we wanted it to

I be. We’re very’ priviledged to

/Iifhave a big end show...a lot of

‘ 0);‘

  weu. PAY YOU TO an INTO
SHAPEK  IS ysnnrn.  

“shows go out without much
style.”

Christopher said‘ that he has

been prepared for the end of
M*A "'S"‘H since talk of “the last
season” surfaced two years ago,
pointing out that he knew it

wouldn’t go on forever. But will
it?

Christopher will join Harry
Morgan and Jamie Farr in a new
series .that will begin production
in July. The show \will portray
their respective M *A“S*H char-
acters stateside and the writer

will be long-time M*A*S*H

staffer Larry Gelbart.

“I alwaysifelt I could do more I

as Mulcahy,” Christopher said.
“I’d like to see him do more
comedy. This new show is about
three friends and their relations
will have comic possibilities.”

He sees the problems caused
by typecasting as a price you
have to pay in order to continue
to work.

“I think you can learn as an
actor working in almost any-
thing,” Christopher said. “Work-
ing a lot is the most important
thing and M"‘A*S"'H gave me
that chance.”

While many have seen
M*A*S"‘H as America’s prime-
time deliverer of political and
moral commentary, Christopher

’ questioned those perceptions.

“I think it’s very dangerous to" '

go around being pompous about
M*A*S*H ,”Christopher said.
“The basic thing we were charged
with was entertaining.”

He thinks that theseries deve-
loped into a stronger show as the
years went by, adding that the

transitions made necessary * by’
- changes in the cast allowed the

writers to inject new blood into
both the characters and story
lines.

“As the show went on, Alan
[Alda] developed a lot of clout
and was able to make himself
heard,” Christopher said. “If the
writers wrote scenes that he felt

A would come off as hollow, [he]

didn’t hesitate to tear into them.

There was quite a bit of dialogue».

that was actor-supplied.”
Christopher struggled to call

’ part
_;s;c.h2d.u1e-

any single episode his favorite
although one, entitled The Inter-
view, seemed particularly clear in
his memory. That episode, lar-
gely improvised by the cast, was
inspired by Edward W. Mur-
row’s interviews with the troops
in Korea which had been seen by
head writer Gelbart.

He did sound discontented
with some aspects of his charac-
ter’s portrayal, suggesting that"
the bumbling, naive side of Mul-
cahy had been overplayed.
Christopher said that he attemp-
ted to handle things like the “his
sister, the sister”'storyline with a
touch of humorous intent but he
appeared to doubt his success.

“I think that character [his sis-
ter] could become a real charac-
ter,” Christopher said, looking
ahead to his new proiect.

“It’s not another M*A*S*H,"
he said.. “It’s essentially about
three friends. The important
thing is to have an entertaining
show.”

20th-Century-Fox, who owns
the M*A*S*H characters, had
the show’s producer, Bur-t Met-5'
calf, -under contract for another
year so they approached him
with the idea for the spin-off.
CBS responded so favorably to
the idea that the usual procedure
of making and selling a pilot has
been sidestepped and the show
will go straight into producton as

.‘:r;::‘;n.,,,V.., .,_,

Next week’s airing of the
M *A *S*H special will be the last
seen this season; the returning
Alice will take over the time slot.
Christopher hopes that CBS will
reconsider airing reruns over the
summer as a way of welcoming in
the new show.

Regardless, Christopher
insists that he’s very lucky to be
continuing on as Father Mul-
cahy and very happy to be a
working actor.

' . Christopher discussed all the tran-

‘Ironically, Christopher, along

“We all sat down and talked about
the series, but through the efforts of
some, we decided to continue,”

He then revealed some entertain-

clips of M*A"‘S"'H out-takes that
were not suitable for television. The

"clips, filled with profane language,

contained everything from Colonel
Potter's (Harry Morgan) falling flat
on his face to Radar O’Reilly’s (Gary

dropped his pants in one particular
scene.

By PAM CYGRYMUS.

A team of Pitt doctors are looking
into ways to treat recurrent attacks
of genital herpes using interferon.

Currently, the only treatment for
genital herpes is acyclovior, which
lessens the symptoms of a first
attack but does not prevent recur-
rences, Dr. Monto Ho, the professor
and chairman of the department of
microbiology in the Graduate
School of Public'Health and chief of
infectious diseases in the School of
Medicine, said a more effective
treatment than acyclovior is needed.

“We hope to determine whether
topical applications of interferon
can decrease the severity and hasten
the healing of recurrent genital
herpes,” Ho said.

Joining H0 in the research are Dr.
George Pazin, assistant associate
professor of medicine, Dr. James
I-larger, assistant professor of
obstetrics and gynecology in the
medical school, and two virologists,
Dr. John Armstrong and Dr. Mary
Kay Breinig.

The patients of the study, men and
women over 18, will receive topical
ointment for five days. A topical
ointment is one that is applied exter-
nally to the blisters.

Half of the of the patients receive
interferon ointment, and half will
receive a placebo, which will allow
comparisons between the control
group (placebo group) and the

experimental group (interferon
group).

Pazin said that whether or not the
patient gets interferon is “almost
secondary.” lHe said that he believes
all patients will benefit by the study
because it is very important for peo-
ple with genital herpes to be able to
discuss it withsomeone.

Although there is no formal coun-
selling, Pazin said the patients have
the opportunity to ask questions and
to gain a better understanding of the
disease.

Interferon, a natural anti-viral
protein made by the body, was .dis-
covered in the late 1950s. Ho has
been involved in research using the
drug since its discovery.

According to Breinig, interferon
is being studied as a treatment for
genital herpes because it has been
successful in the treatment of oral
herpes.

The study of the effect of inter-
feron on oral herpes was conducted
between 1976 and 1978 by Pazin and
Ho. Patients who underwent
surgery to correct severe facial pain,
“trigeminal neuralgia,” caused by
damage to the trigeminal nerve,

seemed prone to recurrent attacks of ‘

oral herpes.

Oral herpes causes blisters com-
monly. known as coldsores in the
area of the mouth. Once a person
has been infected by the virus, oral
or genital, attacks recur
periodically.

  Herpes Treatments Attempts

Interferon and a placebo were
administered to patients undergoing
the surgery for a total of five days:
the day before surgery, the day of
surgery and,three days following
_surgery.

The results showed that of those
patients receiving the placebo, 83
percent had a recurrence of oral
herpes. Only 47 percent of the group
treated with interferon suffered a
recurrence. Also, the attacks occur-

ing within the interferon group were

milder and of a lesser duration than
the attacks that occurred in the
placebo group.

This study demonstrated that
interferon is effective in suppressing
oral herpes recurrences, Pazin said.

According to Pazin, there are two
critical problems concerning genital
herpes. First, the herpes virus has
the ability to get into the nerve
bodies that supply the genital area.
Second, the virus remains dormant
in the nerve bodies and causes recur-
ring attacks of painful blisters in the
genital area.

The first study concerning the
effects of interferon on genital
herpes was begun two years ago. The
study, systemic interferon (by injec-
tion), involves only women who are
experiencing their first attack of
genital herpes. This _
makes it difficult to get volunteers—‘
to date,_only 38 women have partici-
pated in the study. ’

The new drug, Accutane, was
developed by Hoffman-Roche and
first tested by National Institute of
Health in Bethesda, Md. ‘

According to Dr. Lawrence
Richard Feldman, who is heading
the study, the drug could be classi-
fied as a miracle drug.

“We did clinical tests on patients
at various dosages and found that it
was very successful,” Feldman said.

The results of the study doneat
the National Institute of Health dis-
covered that 90 percent of the facial
lesions and 70-90 percent of the back
and‘chest lesions cleared when the
medicine wastaken.

Accutane is a revolutionary drug
because it is a synthetic compound.

 

‘<1,



Vitamin A was found effective in .

healing acne, but it had many side
effects when taken in large doses,
Feldman said. _

“Accutane is a synthetic com-
pound that works on the same lines
as Vitamin A but has fewer side
effects,” Feldman said.

One of its side effects is that it 5

dries up 90 percent of the skin's oil.
However, according to Feldman,
“that’s the price you have to pay‘ to
have clear skin.”

Another of the drug’s characteris-
tics is that it is teratogentic—-it can
can cause birth defects if pregnacy
occurs when a woman is on the med-
ication. Feldman added that once a
women patient is off Accutane for a
month’s time and has her normal
menstrual cycle, she is safe for
pregnancy. .

Feldman, a staff doctor in the der- ,

matology department, is attempting
to study the medicine's effect on less
severe cases of acne. To do this, he
is organizing experimental groups
with moderate acne problems.

The experimental groupswill be _

monitored frequently (four months
on the medication and four months
off) and blood will be checked on a
regular basis. ‘

Feldman is currently seeking
volunteers for the study. In order to

I E qualify for the study, a subject must

have at least five lesions on each side
0 his face and must be in good
physical condition.

If you would like to participate in
this study, please call Feldman at

Board

By PAUL CORREA

The Student Government Board
reviewed and accepted a tuition
freeze proposal at last Friday’s
meeting.

The proposal, submitted by the
Governmental Relations Commit-
tee, was approved by a unanimous
vote. The resolution stated that Pitt
students have been faced with
increasing tuition for the last five

guconsecutive years. Pitt's tuition is
” also the fourth highest of all state-

funded universities. Many services
to the students have been cut (such
as the geography department and
varisty sports), and PHEAA student
aid has not increased its student
allotment for the 1984 ﬁscal _vear.
“Be it resolved that we, the Stu-
dent Government Board, do hereby
petition the Board of Trustees of the

S University of Pittsburgh to maintain

tuition levels for the 1983-84 year at
current 1982-83 levels.” .

Board member Mindy Goldberg
presented the resolution on behalf of
the Governmental Relations
Committee.

The Student Government Board

‘heard three requests from the Heinz

Chapel Choir. The first request was
for $2,881 for the rental of Carnegie
Music Hall to hold a concert on
April 30. The Allocations Commit-
tee recommended that the request be
funded with one stipulation-—that
the concert be held earlier than April
30.

According to James Shelton,
chairman of the Allocations Com-
mittee, the reason for the stipulation
was “most of the student body goes
home after finals, and I cannot fore-
see a big student turnout.”

James Cunningham, president of
the choir, said it would be impossi-
ble to move the concert date. Cun-
ningham said, “The music we are
performing is very difficult, and we
need the time to practice.” He added

that the choir would be unable to i

practice during finals.

Board member Jeff Schaffer said,
“I’m all for the concert program, but
seeing that student money will be
used and seeing how late in April it
will be, I don’t see how the program
will attract any students.” Shaffer
added that if the date were moved
up, he would be “happy to vote in
favor of the request.” ,

The board voted to fund the
request with the stipulation recom-
mended by the comrnittee.

Cunningham argued that, histori-

3 cally, the SGB had funded profes-

sional musicians and soloists and
that “suddenly it was not the case.”
He said the choir “cannot limit itself
to solely a capella work” and added
that only two of the six pieces it is
planning will require professional
accompaniment. _

The second and third requests by
the choir were for $1,000 and $1,800.

’ 

The $1,000 request was for 10 pro-
fessional musicians. The $1,800 was
for live soloists in the choir‘s pro-
duction of Oedipus Rex. The com-
mittee’s recommendation was to not
fund either request. Shelton said
that the Heinz Chapel Choir should
do a concert that doesn't require
professional musicians. “We’re not
here to fund professional musi-
cians,” he said.

Allocations member Ann O’Con-
nor said, “The reason we have such a
problem with the professional musi-
cians and soloist is that we get the
impression that the decisions are
coming down from up above, that
they (the choir) have a director who
is saying, ‘These are the pieces that
we are going to perform and go to‘
the SGB and ask for funding.’ Our
concern is when do the students
come in and why can’t they say,
‘Let’s do a piece that we can handle.’
The impression I get is that their
director says, ‘Let’s do this piece,
and if we can't do it, we’ll hire pro-

A fessionals. Well, is this a student

organization or a professional
organization?” ‘

Shelton said that by approving
the request “we could be setting a
dangerous precedent, that of fund-
ing professional performers.”

The board voted to reject the com-
mittee’s recommendation on the
request for musicians 5-2. That

request goes back to the Allocations

Committee for reconsideration. The
request for $1,800 was also sent back
to the Allocations Committee after
President Mark Downs decided to
withhold his vote. "

In other business, Masada, one of
the sponsors of I-srael Week, submit-
ted two programs to take the place
of the ones cut_by the board last
week. ‘

Instead of a wine and cheese
party, Masada will bring in Senator
Joseph Biden to lecture at ‘a cost of
$1,944. The board voted unanim-
ously to approve the lecture.

I The second program was a recon-
struction of the Purim Party that
was cut last week. As it stands now,
the “cultural” segment of the party
will be held during the first hour and
the “social" segment of the party will
be held afterward. The board passed
the program at a cost of $516. An ad
campaign for Israel Week at a cost
of $410 was also approved.

A request for $1,436 was submit-
ted by the Nursing Student Organi-
zation to attend a nursing
convention in Baltimore, Maryland.

In committee reports, the Legal
Awareness Committee reported that
it is working on a “very important
case.” The case involves a student
who accused a campus policeman of
assault. The committee, in investi-
gating the case, found that on Nov.
15, 1982, the student filed a com-
plaint against the campus police.
Upon further investigation,‘ the
committe found that the campus
police had said they turned it over to
the intern_al affairs department.

Legal Awareness spokesman Jim
Brady said that “we have sufficent

Apartment renters in Oakland are
at the mercy of landlords, and most
renters pay for their mistakes.

Experienced renters know that
finding an apartment near campus is
not easy and that ﬁnding a decent
one is almost impossible. Landlords
in the Oakland area know large
numbers of students are desperate
for a place to live. The condition of
many Oakland apartments is de-
scribed by renters like Ed Astley as
rundown, dirty and, in a few cases,
almost uninhabitable, .but most
landlords still receive too many dol-
lars for their rooms.

“If you’re going to live in Oak-
land, you're going to take what you
can and pay the cost,” Mary Lou
Sosso of Pitt’s Off-Campus Housing
Office said.

The Housing Office lists apart-
ments which landlords submit for a
fee of $10. Acco/rding to Sosso, the
university leaves the quality of the
apartments to the students.

She added that students should
not be misled by advertising of a
university listing. When most’ off-
campus units are advertised, they
are built up to be much more than
they really are.

The primary source for apartment
information is the university hous-
ing listing located in the Housing

The Pitt News, Wednesday February 23, 1983‘

Oakland Renters Face The Old Problems

Office and newspapers like The Pitt
News.

According to Sosso, landlords
come in two categories--private
renters and realtors. She added that
there are good and bad landlords in
both categories.

A building can have 20 or 21 vio-
lations and still remain open, she
explained. But still worse, she said, _if
a tenant complains and action_ is
taken by the city, the tenant is then
displaced and has no place to live
until the problem is corrected-

The problems a tenant might have
are handled by city departments,
which also take care of health prob-
lems. But the system is a no-win
situation for tenants, according to
Sosso.

which can be awhile.

The problems of each renter differ
from one building jto the next.
Upkeep and maintainance, how-

, ever, seem to be the biggest prob-

lems in most apartments.

Mary Braithwaite, a sophomore,
spoke about her landlord, “He’s not
interested in the building, just in
making as much money as he can."

“They made it look like we were
getting a lot for our money when we
were really getting the shaft," Nor-
man Kerr, a junior, said. ‘

Astley, a first-year apartment ren-
ter explained that when landlords
showed him the apartment, they
showed him the nicest one in the
building and not the one in which he
now lives.

Apartment leases can be used
against the tenant, Kerr said,
because they utilize the fine print.
He was referring to Daniels Realty
Company, which started charging
tenants for natural gas by installing
meters for each unit. '

“We trusted too many people,"
Braithwaite said, commenting on
the same issue.

Harriette Mullooly of Daniels
Realty Company declined to com-
ment on the gas meter situation‘.
“Anyone can look (at an apartment)
and judge for himself," she said.

The problem many face is a lack

I of response from their landlords.

“I do like this place, but there's
been too many problems while living
here. ‘If the landlords wouldn’t own
so many buildings, the problems
would be taken care of faster and
more efficiently,” Kim Stevens, a
sophomore nursing major, said.

—-Page7

' “I'd go through someone who has
one building, not the whole block,“
Braithwaite said, again referring to
Daniels Realty, which owns a
number of units on McKee Place.

Rental prospects in Oakland are
limited to the Housing Office, which
has a few suggestions to make things
easier, according to Sosso.

One of the most important tips
when looking for a place to live,
according to Sosso, is to look at dif-
férent places and not simply sign the
first lease.

It is also important to start look-
ing in April or May for a fall apart-
ment. The renter should also
consider whether his landlord is
being honest.

For example, will he keep the
security deposit or honor com-
plaints? She added that these are
things that should be considered
before signing anything.

The Housing Office is interested
in helping people get the best deal,
according to Sosso. They need help
from students to provide this
service.

Sosso said the Housing Office‘

runs a “student comment file,
which is operated so students can see
what former tenants have said about
various apartments. Students are a
main source of information in this
area, and she added that she encour-
ages people to file comments, both
good and bad, on all apartments.

Politics
, And
Poﬂuﬁon

The recent uproar over toxic wastes and Super
Fund mismanagement by the Environmental
Protection Agency has all the elements of a fast-
paced spy novel: paper shredders, charges and
countercharges of corruption and Reagan’s
adamant refusal—-then agreement——to release
certain documents. For Americans sensitized to
scandal, the situation sounds all too familiar.

The relationship between the EPA, members
of the Reagan Cabinet and environmentalists has
not been one based on trust. The Reagan admin-
istration has continually favored the relaxing of
federal regulations governing air pollution, acid
rain, toxic wastes and‘ the turning over of wilder-
ness areas to strip mining and business concerns,
and members of his cabinet, especially Secretary
James Watt, have blamed the environmentalists
for everything that's wrong with this country.

- Matters are getting worse.
Since the abrupt dismissal of EPA’s adminis-

trator in charge of toxic wastes, many questions

have been raised that leave Reagan and his poli-
cies toward environmental issues in an embarrassing
position. Now, with EPA administrator Anne Gor-
such (now Anne. McGill Buford_) playing a_game of
politics with toxic waste, the suggestions that
certain documents needed as evidence in Con-
gressional investigations have been erased ‘or
altered abound. -

If this is more than supposition, it onlyiadds to
the drama; if not, then those concerned would do
well to clear the air. If this is not done, claims that
the Reagan Administration shows favoritism to
business and polluters of the environment will
prove reasonable.

The present situation is inexcusable. Over 400’
toxic waste sites considered dangerous to the
public health have been listed for clean-up, but
the EPA has been too-slow in doing anything
about the mess. The purpose of the Super Fund
was to pay for cleanup operations immediately,
avoiding time-consuming litigation—which is
what the administration and the EPA are caught
up in right now. _

George Orwell would have liked the title of the
EPA, For an agency that protects the environ-
ment, something in which we all have a stake, it,
has used at best questionable methods.

I Letters To The Editor

Dear Editor:

In the article that appeared in the
Jan. 5, 1983, publication of The Pitt
News, R. Butko spoke out about her
feelings towards the athletic depart-
ment cutbacks. As of Jan. 1983, the

 

athletic department cut the men’s
volleyball and women's field hockey
teams. Butko posed a solution, sug-
gesting other cutbacks that should
be made to allow continued funding
for volleyball and field hockey, but
these were not realistic. In addition,
Ibppose the idea of saving athletics
without even thinking of the aca-
demic programs that are facing cuts.

Butko complained that, during
the time that she played field
hockey, there were never any specta-
tors due to poor scheduling of the
games. Although she was at Pitt for
four y_ears, she did not mention ever
attempting to solve this problem.
Why the appeal now, after this deci-
sion has been made? Why didn’t she
fight the system and do some public
relations for her team? ' -

Columns

The Pitt News encourages
and accepts column submis-
sions from interested faculty,
students and staff. All sub-
missions should be typed and
double-spaced on non-
erasable paper. The subject
matter is left to the discretion
of the author. All submis-
sions should be addressed to
The Pitt News, Fourth Floor
Schenley Hall, and should
I include the writer’s name,
phone number and university

The first‘~solution she proposed

' was to reduce the amount of money

allotted to the football players’
dinner fund. The football team
brings money into the school but is
always the first to be attacked when
money is needed in other areas. She
said that the guys should eat at
Burger King, as her team did. But it
is likely that a football player would
order triple the amount of a normal
individual in a fast food restaurant,
consequently defeating the idea of
saving money.

Butko then talked about the sup-
port Penn State offers all of its var-
ious teams. Does she realize that
Penn State is a . state-supported
school while _ Pitt is only state-
affiliated? While Penn State teams
are good and have the support of the
students there, teams like the
women's field hockey team at Pitt

Boycott

Dear Editor:

I would like to address the
increasing problem of burglary inci-
dents in the Hillman Library. Being
a recent victim of this crime, I would
bet whatever money remains in my
checking account (after purchasing/
a duplicate set of this term's text-
books) that the criminal is someone
who is not a member of the adminis-
tration, faculty or student body of
the University of Pittsburgh.

1 bﬁieve that the only solution to
this rising issue of “rip off the stu-
dent who needs a drink or a visit to

We’re One Of TheBest  

have not been playing all that well
for some time. As an undergraduate
student, I’m sure that the team she
attacked the most, football, is one
she supported also.

Butko may not have seen the full

)"

range of our economic troubles. It is— _

not only athletic teams that are fa-
ciryz cuts—other programs here to
help minority students are in trouble
as well. For example, the English
department of UCEP has been cut
this year and maybe the entire pro-
gram next.

Finally, how can she say that her
pride in Pitt is fading? I am sure that,
like most students, she came here for
an education, not athletics. To stu-
dents at Pitt, I say be proud that we
have a reputation for being one of
the best.

the restroom” is to require display of
validated Pitt ID for admission to
the library. Instead of using the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh’s Hillman
Library, the non-Pitt population
oould game the public Carnegie
Library. Because there is no admis-
sion charge for use of the Hillman
Library, my belief is thatgwe do not
need the burglars—they need us and
our belongings.

In conclusion, I feel that we
should innovate the present library
system and boycott the student
body's export of possessions to the
unwelcomed criminals.

Q

What If They Come   For   You ?

Dear Editor:

I read with interest the conflicting editor-
ials in the Feb. 11 issue of The Pitt News in

\ "“relation to “McCarthyism, red-‘baiting and

the nuclear freeze movement.” I commend
The Pitt News for its stance in support ofthe
freeze movement and its exposition of the
McCarthyite tactics implemented by the
Reagan Administration and ‘neo-
McCarthyites like Jerimiah Denton and
Jesse Helms, who are attempting to discredit
the freeze movement,
However, Scott Rex’s “Communists and
the ‘Freeze’ Movement” astonished me. I
find it appalling that Rex would even write

' such contradictory trash as “I’m all for com-

munists speaking their mind, but they
should not be permitted to join the freeze
movement."

This statement in and of itself is blatant

“red-baiti_ng." It apologizes for the
McCarthyite attacks of the Reagan Admin-
istration and breeds an underlying anti-
communist sentiment. Hisclaim that “all the
communists want to do is split the move-

Does Rex not remember the FBI’s
“COINTELLPRO" counterintelligence
program, which spied on and inﬁltrated

tions during the ’60s and '70s? Rex should

merit” is even more utterly ludicrous. Rex
should only examine the record of the CIA

_ and FBI in relation to splitting movements

and note that the U.S. government and its
various intelligence agencies are the main
culprits inthis field.

examine the role of the FBI in the assassina-
tion of Black Panther leader Freddie Hamp-
ton, whose widow just won a $1.6 million
lawsuit against the U.S. government and the
smear campaign they mounted to discredit
Dr. Martin Luther King. And most recently,

Rex shouldreview the role of U.S. govern- V
. .ment agents in the “Greensboro Massacre,”

in which five members of the Communist
Workers Party were gunned down in cold
blood by Ku Klux Klansmen and Nazis.

Agents of the FBI and the Bureau ofAlco-
hol, Tobacco and Firearms had infiltrated
the Klan and Nazis, armed them and pro-
voked them into shooting the CWP
members.

The history of U.S. government subver-
sion and harassment of its own citizens has
not diminished and in fact continues to a
great extent today.‘ Reagan's executive
order, allowing the CIA to spy for the first
time within the continental U.S., is an exam-
ple of the continued erosion of civil liberties
in America. Reagan has not stopped there in
his effort to turn back the clock on the free-

. dom of dissent in the U.S.

He has done his best to gut the Freedom of
Information Act and broaden the scope of
“executive privilege” in classifying and re-
classifying information. His assault on the
Fourth Amendment is another alarming
characteristic of declining civil liberties and
freedom of dissent.

As a matter of fact, the scope of U.S.
clandestine activities at home and abroad
has increased dramatically. Since Reagan’s
executive order the FBI and CIA have
mounted incredibly sophisticated cam-
paigns to entrap people. What began under
Carter with Abscam, which resulted in the
entrapment of various senators and con-
gressmen and continued by entrapping John
DeLorean and his cocaine deals, has set up
an unprecedented apparatus to spy on U.S.
citizens. I

They have also turned this campaign on
the mass of the American people who are
involved in the nuclear freeze movement, the
unemployed and the countless other organi-
zations opposed to Reagan’s assault on the
poor and working peoples of the U.S. Cou-
ple this with what The New York Times calls
“the most ambitious paramilitary campaign
mounted by the CIA in nearly a decade” in
Nicaragua to overthrow the Sandinista
government and you see a police-state appa-

ratus matched sincetthe days of Richard
Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover.

On all fronts, the Reaganities have
regressed to the infamous days of the “Bay of
Pigs" and the CIA disinformation cam-
paigns of the Vietnam War period.
McCarthyis_m and the anti-communist
smear campaign to discredit the freeze
movement are intentional attempts by the
Reagan Administration to slander legiti-
mate dissent and to carry through with his
plans to escalate the arms race and stall any
serious arms negotiations.

Reagan also must resort to the ugly tactics
of McCarthyism in face of mounting opposi-
tion to his economic programs at home and
his interventionist policies abroad. While
millions of Americans are out of work and
countless others are homeless and malnour-
ished, it is easy for Reagan to label anyone

' who apeaks out a “communist." He must use

such disinformation to divide the American
people while he continues to bail out the
Pentagon and the arms manufacturers, who
benefit greatly by producing weapons of
mass destruction, and to continue his givea-
way programs to the wealthy elite of the U.S.

The anti-communist atmosphere perpet-
rated by the Reagan Administration and
Scott Rex are startling. This hysteria
heightens the police-state mentality and
apparatus in the U.S. and promotes distrust
among those concerned with such issues as
the nuclear freeze. It detracts from the main
argument——whether or not we should con-
tinue building nuclear weapons and prepar-
ing to win’ and survive a nuclear wa_r——and
strengthens the hand of those who seek to
factionalize us.

Scott Rex, and others of his kind, should
take this to heart and realize the service they
provide for the Reagan Administration and
the Cold Warriors in the Pentagon.

It brings to heart a famous quote muttered

by Pastor Martin Niemoller, who survived a" '

Nazi concentration camp in WWII Ger-

‘On all fronts, the Reaganites
have regressed to the
infamous days of the “Bay of
Pigs”... ’

many. He said, “In Germany, first they came
for the Communists, but I did not speak up,
for I was not a Communist. Then they came
for the trade unionists, then the Jews...
When they came for me, therewas no one
left to speak up."

Such misinformed rhetoric spewed about
by the Rexes and the Reagans, only spreads
distrust, creates disunity and tightens the
grip of the Cold Warriors in Washington.

I wonder what Mr. Rex might say if they
came for him?

In the 1960s and early ’70s, the
draft was an issue that caused
much uproar- and rebellion
against what many viewed as an

unjust society. An issue that

touched every aspect of life—-
moral, religious and legal-the
draft was a source of hatred and
fear in young people on college
campuses across the country.

Becauseofthe mass draft reg- ’

istration called for under the
Carter Administration, and
more recently, a requirement
that all eligible students register
for the draft as a condition to
receiving federal aid, it is once
again an issue presentedbefore
American students. ‘_
This time around, however,

’ the stormy feelings of the 1960s

have given wayto a general atti-
tude of apathy, and the strong
protests on moral and «ethical
grounds have dwindled to tacit

~ compliance in the face of a

nationwide economic struggle..

Advertisements encouraging
eligible young men to register
say that by registering with
Selective Service (the adminis-

’ tration that runs the draft), one

is not actually signing up for the
draft.
“That’s the same thing as say-

ing that the post office is not the

mail,” said political science pro-
fessor Michael Johnston. “They
[the Selective Service] say that
by registering they get an idea of
what kind of manpower is
available.”

’ Johnston believes that this
registration was a response to

the situation in Afghanistan in
_ 1979. “Carter needed to ﬂex a

little muscle,” he said.

Taking it a step further, a fed-
eral law has been passed that
requires all eligible students to
register with Selective Service

’ before receiving Title Four fund-

ing, which is federal financial aid.

This requirement will affect

about 14,000 students at Pitt.
Daniel May, director of

-Admissions and Student Aid at
Pitt, is currently chairing a com-
mittee to determine how. the
new requirement will be imple-
mented. May has several con-
cerns about the operation of this
regulation.

The Pitt News, Wednesday February 23, 1983

Sign of   The

“The Selective Service is
going to incorporate [the
requirement] with the affidavit
[students’] saying they’re using
the [Title Four] money for their
education. The problem is, they
have to verify it,” May said.

Just the fact that Selective
Service must produce a letter of
verification for every student
who has registered is a concern
to May, not to mention the
follow-up procedures his office
must take to obtain the stu-
dents’ letters.

“Once we set this mechanism
up, we’re going to be able to
accept these ,letters from thou-

get a job,” he said. “This thing
never would have ﬂown in the

.1605.”

If the requirement is over-
turned, May said that he

believes it will be because of,

pressure on the administration
rather than pressure from the
students. .

Stephen Somers, an aid to
Sen. John Heinz, said that there
is little chance of this legislation

being overturned because of its .

“apple pie and baseball”
connotations.

“Once you have this sort of’

‘patriotic gesture’ by Congress,”
Somers said, “you’re going to

thing I do is talk about whether
there is going to be adraft.”

Although there is no active
drafting at the moment, Hahn
said she believes that Selective
Service is planning to have a
draft soon. a

“All that has to happen in
order to begin drafting young
men is for Congress togive the
president the power to -order
inductions,” she said.

“I’m giving the information-
what the law and the regulations
are. Regulations can change

 “.

sands of students,” he said.

“There’s a whole number of
things that can go wrong. _
“Anytime you’re following up
on as many students as we have,
that creates a lot of work.”

Timing will be an important
factor when dealing with these
letters, according to May, who
calls it “an administrative
nightmare.”

For example, if a student says
that he lost his letter—or never
received it-—do— they give him the
loan and wait for the letter, or do
they withhold the loan?

May does not- know yet how
his office will enforce this regula-
tion, but he doesn’t predict,-that
there will be many violators. An
undergraduate at Duquesne
from ’65 to ’69, he said that there
is a difference in concerns-of the
students now as compared to
the draft registration of the ’60s.

"When I started [college];
Animal House mentality was a
lot of it,” May said. “Then you
got into the political thing in the
’60s and early '70s. Then things
changed again and were not as

militant.”

He said that students now
want an education because of
the tough economic situation,
and there is less student acti-
vism than during the previous
draft era. ‘ L

havea hard time finding any leg-

There hasn’t been a great deal

although it has already been
taken to court by the_ University
of Minnesota.

“Ask an American if it makes

to actually fighting, Somers said.

. “There are all kinds of things you

can do besides shooting a gun at
some poor villager somewhere.”

Nevertheless, many do feel
that the draft is morally wrong-
about 500,000 people haven’t
registered for this recent draft.
There are already fourteen peo-
ple in the United States. who are

than 10 days to decide whether
they want deferment, postpone-
ment or a conscientious
objection.

A conscientious, objector is,
according to the law, any person
who by reason of religious train-
ing and belief, cannot participate.
in war in any form. Also any per-
son who, for reasons of moral
and ethical values that they hold
in the same standards as reli-
gious beliefs, will qualify for this
classification. T

“My personal theory is that
everyone is a conscientious
objector if they just knew it,”
Hahn said. “Not many people
would put themselves where
they might have to kill another
human being at the order of
somebody they didn’t know very
well and maybe didn’t respect.”

As a draft counsellor, Hahn
goes through a list of reasons to
be deferred with the young man.
She has about one such inter-
view a month, “but this month I
have already seen two, and two
more are‘ lined up.” .

She also is visited occasionally
by a mother who does not want
to see her son drafted.

values—and it is against the law
to avoid the draft registration.
“The young people have to

 realize that this [regulation of

financial aid] isn’t taking any-
thing away from them,” Somers
said. “It ishelping them to see
that they have to obey the law.”

The federal regulation is being
eased at Earlham College, a
Quaker school in Richmond,
which is giving financial aid to
students who » are denied it
because of the regulation. Yale
is also considering implementing
such a procedure. 

According to Somers, the reg-
ulation is clearly an enforcement
of Selective Service, rather than

it.”

May agrees that this does not
relate to budgetary cuts.

“Right now there’s a feeling
that I don’t think it has anything
to do with the budget or cost-
cutting,” Somers said. “If you’re
going to get federal money,
you’re going to comply with the
law. I think that’s the hammer.

“There’s enough federal regu-
lations instituted that are used
for budgetary means.”

“Back in the middle ’60s,
when the first anti-war demon-
strations were going on, there

I ston said. “It was a very emo-

tional issue ;. I’ don’t think many

He added, ‘‘I would guess peo-
ple around here will go along in a
pretty resigned fashion.”

  Selective Service

The Solomon Amendment is
a law recently passed by Con-
gress that requires all male stu-
dents that are applying for
federal ﬁnancial aid to register
with the Selective Service.

The law was passed last

summer, but the government -

has been lax concerning its
enforcement.

This coming fall, however, the
government plans to enforce the
law, and this means that all male
students who are not registered
for the Selective Service will be
denied financial aid. .

' The Amendment affects some

14,000 students at Pitt (including —

the branch campuses) who
receive in excess of $25 million.

Various 'students around
campus were asked if they regis-
tered, and why or why not. This
produced a variety of answers.

“(I registered) because I was
supposed to; it is the law,” said
one Pitt student. “(Selective Ser-
vice) made it clear that it was just

a registration and not a draft. If it ,

was a draft,I don’t know what I’d
do.”

“It’s ‘foolish to - resist register-

yet,” junior Bryce Swan said.

Michael C. Zeigler, a junior,
agreed. “They said that we had
to. It’s not like we're going to
war, anyway. If (a war) is tomor-
row, I'll just be a draft evader,”
he said. ‘

Currently, those who refuse
to register face a $10,000 fine

. and a five-year jail sentence.

This is why Keith Christian, a
junior, registered.

“By not signing up, you’re put-
ting yourself‘ into hot water,”
Christian said. “You just sign up
and nothing happens.”

Adrian Hodge, a junior CGS
student, spent four years with
the coast guard and has been a
veteran since last year.

\

“I’m in the - reserves now,”
Hodge said, “so I’ll be one of the
first to go.” '

strong opinion to voice about

whether the government has the
right to impose such a law.

an unfair stipulation for school.”

“Everybody should register,
but denying financial aid is black-

“and that’s not a good policy to _

Margaret Mosites, “why should

“I guess it is necessary for
people to obey the‘ law...al-
though I don‘t advocate military

who ‘is also a veteran. “I can see
arguments for both sides.”

Tim Sperry, a member of -the
War Resistors League, said
about the Solomon Amend-
merit, “These young men are
being punished for standing up
for their beliefs.”

He also said that he was not
surprised at the passing of this
law, but appalled by it.

One draft resistor said that his
reasons for not registering were
“really clear and obvious”:

 “I can’t conceive being part of .

 SYRACUSE, N.Y. — “To say

of an understatement," Panther
head track coach John Vasvary said
following the team’s surprising

The Panther total of I03 points

- was bettered only by an outstanding

In the hurdles, it took a Big East

Despite winning the outstanding
performer award, Kingdom was not
satisfied with his performance.

“rm pleased with my time in the

taking second place," he said. ‘‘I
wanted to win. I made too many
mental mistakes, but I was at a dis-

something to do with it."

Along with Kingdom, several
other teammates made it quite clear
that Pitt track and field is a force to
be reckoned with in I983.

Todd Colas won, holding off a

5 Run With The Determination Of Many

came away with fifth place and their A

By DALE MOORE

SYRACUSE, N.Y. — The Lady
Panther indoor track team surprised

’ everyone except themselves this past

weekend at the Big East Indoor
Track and Field Championships
held in Syracuse, N.Y.

With only five runners, Pitt tied
for fifth place in the Big East with
Boston College, both tallying 38
points. Villanova ran away from the
field, followed by the University of
Connecticut, Syracuse, St. John’s,
Pitt and Boston College, George-
town, Providence and Seton Hall.

“We came in here with ﬁve girls
and ran with full teams of 20 girls,"
Pitt coach Elbert Kennedy said.

Tying for fifth was an incredible
feat when the Pitt women only par-

_ ticipated in only six different events. .

With just a few more girls, Pitt could
have placed higher in the standings
because many of the events——t-he
relays especially—only had six
entries, which meant that no matter
how slowly the last place team ran, it
was awarded one team point.

“There were a lot of cheap points
this weekend,” Syracuse coach
Andy Jugan said. “If you have the
bodies to put on the track, you can
pick up points.”

The Lady Panthers may not have
many bodies, but Kennedy will take

quality over quantity any day. And
the five Lady Panthers gave a new
meaning to that phrase this
weekend. .

Sophomore Renee Henderson
ran away from the field in both the
55-meter dash and the 300-meter
dash after winning her qualifying
heats in both events. No one chal-
lenged Henderson on her way to the
twin victories and both of Hender-
son’s times established meet records.

Freshman Gail Counts was not
far behind teammate Henderson as
she placed third in both the 55- and
300-meter dashes. In the 300-meter
dash, Counts missed placing second
by only three one-hundredths of a
second.

Henderson and Counts came
back to team with Marsha Hawkins
and Sue Torre to place third in the
1,600-meter relay.

Torre got the Lady Panthers off
and running with one of her best
times for the 400-meters, 59.7
seconds. Counts kept contact with
the other competitors, but the
fatigue from running the heats and
finals in the two earlier events
started to take its toll nearthe end of
her leg of the relay. Hawkins made
up for the lost ground, and the Lady
Panthers were battling for third
when Hawkins passed the baton to
Henderson.

Henderson settled into third place

with two girls running on her
shoulder. Coming out of the last
turn and into the home straighta-
way, both girls made their move to
pass Henderson, who found the
strength to hold both of them off.
Also turning in a good perfor-
mance for the Lady Panthers was
distance runner Amy DiFrancesco,
who ran a personal best in the
women’s 3,000-meters to place
eighth against some of the strongest
competition to be found anywhere.
The weekend was not without dis-
appointment for the Lady Panthers,

however. Hawkins, ahead in her
heat and the leading eventual winner
of the 55-hurdles, hit the last hurdle
before the finish line and fell, caus-
ing her to lose a spot in the finals.
Hawkins, however, came back from
the fall to run an outstanding leg of
the l,600-meter relay and help Pitt
to place third.

The Lady Panthers went up
against some very big odds this
weekend and came out winners.
While competing in only a third of
the events and against teams with up
to four times as many people, they

heads held high.

There was probably one thing
they did that was not very nice. By
running and placing the way that
they did, the Lady Panthers are
probably causing eight other Big
East coaches around the league to
lose some sleep worrying about what
the Lady Panthers could have done
with a full squad.

For the opposition, it would be a
nightmare, but for Kennedy and the

&‘-j,‘_ . ._

Pitt Lady Panthers, it would be 

dream come true.

Pitt Track Has Arrived

By DALE MOORE

SYRACUSE, N.Y.—As the bus
stopped in the Arby’s parking lot
and its occupants began to argue
over the virtues of the various eating
establishments present, a voice rose
above the rest, and all noise and
movement ceased.

“Listen up a minute,” Pitt Panther
track coach John Vasvary said as he
stood up and made his way to the
middle of the bus. Vasvary was now

about which grade school teachers

hungry athletes listened as if in a
trance. 9

“I think the women should be con-
gratulated on tying for fifth place
with only five girls. They did a heck
of a job,” Vasvary said, and the bus
erupted with noise and cheers in
response.

“And for the men,” said Vasvary,
“I think this ‘weekend you have
gained some R-E-S-P-E-C-T.”

Again there was noise, but not as
much as before, as some of the men
just nodded with pride.

But what was purely dream mate-

defeated Georgetown 65-63 in what
may soon become known as The
Fitzgerald Pit House.

It took another rerun of The

Still, it took more. There was a
game MVP, but it was none of the

Pitt’s third upset of a nationally-
ranked team in as many weeks,
probably can’t dribble a ball. His

But Tiger Paul Auslander, who
rises only slightly above Ewing’s
knees, was storming the sidelines
again Saturday, turning over 7,000
fans into screaming maniacs. It
would’ve_ taken a sonic boom to rise
above the crowd’s noise in the
second half.

And Georgetown was rattled. The
Hoyas held a seven-point lead with
slightly over four minutes to play.
Then Auslander went into his act,

people stunned and looking over
their shoulders; the Pitt women are
rapidly gaining on the rest of the Big
East. Competing with only live girls,
the Lady Panthers squad ran with
and defeated teams that had up to 20
members.

After arriving in Syracuse Friday
afternoon, the teams went to have a
light practice at Syracuse’s Manley
Field House where other Big East
teams were also practicing.

Rodney Dangerfield would have
gotten more respect and attention
than the Panther coaches did that
afternoon. It seemed like no one
knew the Panther coaches or had
any desire to get to know them.

It didn't take long for the Pan-
thers and Lady Panthers to get the
opposition’s attention during the
trials on Saturday. Terry Gallagher
started Pitt out on the right foot by
winning his heat of the 500-meter
run, and things were off and run-

ning. The next four Pitt entries also_

won their heats, and if the competiti-
on couldn't see Pitt, they certainly
could hear them.

be content with just watching the

when their .teammates were
announced and filled the nearly
empty field house with noise when
they ran.

While both teams were pumped
up for the meet, the events of Satur-
day afternoon pushed them higher
than any pep talk ever could.

Upon boarding the bus to return
tothe hotel after a good day oftrials
and just placing third in the distance
medley relay, the Panthers learned
that the Pitt basketball team was
down by ll points and things were
looking bad. However, when reach-
ing their rooms, they found the
Panthers up by two over George-
town. '

When the game ended, the third
floor of the Holiday Inn in Syracuse
turned into a miniature Fitzgerald
Field House, and some of the
Panther track team started talking
about their chances of winning the
Big East.

With the basketball team’s win
and learning the next morning that
both the men and women had won
the Big East swimming titles, the Pitt
track teams were ready to compete

SYRACUSE, N.Y. — This past
weekend can be tagged as the begin-
ning of the Vasvary era for the
Panther track team.

In much the same fashion that
Johnny Majors turned around the
Pitt football program in the 1970s
or, more recently, that Roy Chip-
man turned Pitt basketball into a
competitive force in the Big East,
Panther head coach John Vasvary

championships and turned it into
the Big East runner-up. .

When he was appoined head
coach in September, there was a
great deal of optimism, but it is hard
to believe that even the optimists
would have predicted this much suc-
cess this early.

“When I look back to what I
thought about back in ‘September
and where we are now, I’m just very
pleased,” Vasvary said. “It’s hard to
put into words. ‘

“I think we went as far as we could

have in this meet. Everyone we
entered competed to the best of his
ability. It was a super effort.”

If it were up to Vasvary, the credit-
would all go to the competitors, but
the team members won't ever let
Vasvary live down the impact he has
had on them.

“He is the reason that we finished
second in the Big East,” junior Bill
Moorehead said. I

“He took the same group of guys
who were nothing a year ago as a
team and turned us into the Big East
runner-up. That_says it all,”distance

country.

TRACK NOTES: Tim Lewis,
before being disqualified in the semi-
finals, ran an IC4A qualifying time
in the 55-meter dash‘
....Geary, who was the lead-off man
on the 3,200-meter relay team was
pushed down entering the back-
stretch on the opening lap. In the
process, the team lost close to 100
meters. and was unable to recover.

A Vasvary Dawn‘ Of New Pitt Track Era

“He's a classy guy. He makes
things happen. He loves what he’s
doing. He’s the best coach I‘ve ever
had,” sprinter Mario Joyner said.

This team can be compared to so
many of the Cinderella teams that
have accepted challenges that
appear out of reach, but they some-
how manage to meet them.

Maybe this past weekend’s perfor-

mance was an upset to the confer-
ence‘smembers, but as far as Vas-
vary is concerned, it was
characteristic of the type of team
Pitt has. ’

“They went_ out and earned the
respect of the Big East, which says a‘
whole lot,” he said.

“They took on one of the best con- ~
ferences in the country and were
right there. They have come a long
way, but they earned what they have
received; it has not been given to
them.” -

The Panthers now know that they
can believe in themselves, which is
something that not too many of
them could say at the beginning of
the season. Much of this credit has
to be awarded to John Vasvary.

3- :‘I'Ile ebruary. 23 ,. 1'98 3

g (“By MARK A. SINDLER

After competing in two matches
in a three-day period, the Panther
volleyball team found out what-it is
like both to experience the fruits of
victory and to accept disaster.

These are what the Panthers
encountered facing Edinboro State
this past Thursday and George
Mason on Saturday at Trees Hall.
The Panthers easily defeated Edin-
boro 15-5, 15-5 and l5-13. As Coach
Ray Reilly pointed out, the outcome
of the match could have been pre-
dicted by just taking a look at Edin-

”»gboro’s program.

“We did well; there was really no
competition,” Reilly said. “[Edin-
boro] doesn’t really have a strong
program, although they do have
some scholarship money.”

Despite an anemic lineup, Edin-
boro made the final game a nail-

Clarion
Downs 

biter once Reilly decided to go with a
primarily-freshman lineup. With
Tony Zortea and Barry Goldberg
setting the final game, Reilly gave all
the freshmen playing time.

It was not a gamble, he said, but
an opportunity to give the inexpe-
rienced the experience that will be
needed later on. Besides, the Pan-
thers were already _up two _games to
none when Reilly decided to experi-
ment and see whathappened.

“The entire freshman bench got a
little playing time,” he said. “We
went to a 6-2 offense with two setters
instead of just one setter. It was all
an excellent opportunity for playing
time.”

It probably would also have been
an excellent opportunity for some-
one to suggest that Pitt not show up

_for its 7 p.m. encounter with George

Mason on Saturday. The Patriots
blasted the Panthers 15-13, 9-15, I5-

’4 and 15-1 1. It was an upset Reilly
who offered the post mortem.

“Terrible, horrendous; use any
descriptive word you want,” he said.
“We passed poorly, we played no
defense, Chubbyfs (senior Dave
Baird) setting was terrible; it was a
bad night.”

Reilly believes the team “psyched
itself right out of the match.” It was
not a match in which he could point
to one or two factors, there was just
a total tearri breakdown.

In fact, Reilly added, George
Mason was the team that Pitt should
have defeated. The first team was
started for each game, but to no
avail.

“Mason is a good team,” he said,
“but I still don't believe they’re as
good as us. They never have been—

they don’t have as good coaching,

they don’t have as good an athlete;

all-around we are a better,funda-
mental team.

“We did play like it, but Mason
was playing great; they took advan-
tage of everything we did wrong.”

The evening’s crowd seemed to
aid the Patriots’ cause. Of the 200-
250 in attendance, a large majority
were rooting for George‘Mason.
Coming off a tournament win at
New Jersey Institute of Technology,
at_which there were no ranked teams
competing, George Mason attracted
an entourage of followers at Trees
Hall since the program recruits
heavily in this area.

Besides the attendance factor,
however, Reilly attributed a succes-
sion of weak practice sessions last
week to the Panthers’ listless perfor-
mance against George Mason. To
that extent, he blamed himself.

“From my point of view,” the
fourth-year coach said, “it possibly

could have been rnv fault. We had a
couple easy days of practice going
into [the Patriots’ match] and
worked on some mental things other
than physicali ‘

“I think I would take the blame——
but at the start, I didn‘t see any need
for it. I thought [the players] were
ready from past competition.”

In retrospect, Reilly did indeed
give George Mason due respect. His

—playsets were running sharply, he

said, but added that the Patriots

_-—-'P"age»2'i

were able to pick up the crosses and 

x’s “and thingslike that. “

“They played pretty much the way..

we have played against Waterloo
and Penn State," he said. “The
played our game." “

The thing is, if Pitt did not give its
game away, the outcome may have
been different.

The Pitt wrestling team ended its
dual meet season on a sour note,
losing to Clarion 37-6 Saturday.

The gym was packed for Clarion’s
season finale, and this took its toll

I on the Panther squad in more than,-
one way.

 “Sure, the crowd had an effect on
our guys, but I think it had a bigger
effect on the official,” head wrestling
coach Rande Stottlemyer said. “I —
was very angry with the officiating,
but I’m proud of the team because

" they fought back.” -

The score was no indication of
how close the match was as the
Panthers—plagued with recent
injuries—had to depend heavily on
their reserves.

Ciccarello started off tough,
throwing Throckmorton to his back
early to go up 4-0. After Throckmor-
ton worked to get off his back, he
reversed Ciccarello to put the score
at 4-2. Ciccarello escaped, but
Throckmorton took him down
again, leaving the score at 5-4.

Throckmorton then bar-armed
Ciccarello to his back for the last 30
seconds of the period, barely missing
the pin and moving ahead 7-5.

In the second period, Throckmor-
ton escaped but was taken down to
put the score at 8-7. Throckmorton
escaped again, but another Cicca-
rello takedown tied the match at 9-9
to end the period.

In the third period, Ciccarello
went /ahead for good by scoring an
escape and takedown early on.
Throckmorton scored another
escape, but suffered a takedown for
the fifth time, 'pu‘tting the score at

In the first period, Ammon
started off by attempting a head-
lock, but Wertz countered to get the
takedown. Ammon escaped and

the extra point, ending the match in
a tie.

The Panthers lost another close
one at 158 lbs., as Clarion freshman
Nate Carter managed to hang on in
the last period to edge Pitt’s Jeff
Jelic 8-7.

Jelic started strong by taking Car-
ter down at the edge of the mats to
go up 2-0. Carter escaped, but Jelic
double-legged him to the mat to take
a 4-1 lead. In the process of another
Carter escape, Jelic locked his hands
illegally, ending the period at 4-3.

In the second period, Carter
escaped and took Jelic down to go
up 6-4. Jelic ended the period with
an escape.

In the third period, Jelic escaped
again to tie the score at 6-6, but Car-
ter regained his lead, by ta_king Jelic
down. The match was delayed sev-
eral times after that, as both coaches

said. “They [George Washington]
sent the wrong player out to shoot a
foul shot, and she made the first one.
When the mistake was discovered,

’ the player who had been fouled was

permitted to come out and shoot her
two shots. *

“That’s not what it says in the
rulebook—we should have gotten
the ball. When I pointed this out, I
got a technical [foul]. That_’s three

points, and in a two-point game, you

have to protest a call like that.”

Neither team made much use of
substitutes. George Washington
utilized only seven players, with four
of the starting five playing the entire
40 minutes. Lady Panthers Bruce,
Miklasevich and Tirik played exten-
sively, while the other three posi-

tions were alternately ﬁlled by five,

other players,

Kelly Gallentine scored 31 points
for George Washington, and team-
mates Kathy Marshall and Ruth
Moses added 15 and 9 points,
respectively.

The loss breaks a six-game win-
ning streak, dropping the Lady
Panthers’ record to 16-9 overall. The
team has five wins and two losses in
conference play, with one Big East

remaining. \

Tonight the Lady Panthers travel
to Big East rival Villanova; the
Wildcats have 12 wins and 12 losses
overall and are 3-3 in conference
action. ‘

Villanova is led by 5-9 junior
guard Nancy Bernhardt, who has
16.7 points per game and 6.6
rebounds, and 5-9 senior guard
Kathie Beisel, who averages 14.7
points and 7.1 rebounds per game.
Probable starters are 5-1] Noreen
Kemethei, 5-8 ‘A Courtney Vander-
slice and 5-10 guard Rosemarie
Burke.

The Lady Panthers play their final 8

home game Saturday against
Rutgers at the‘ Fitzgerald Field

and one non-conference game,-pg, House.
