With the help of a $69.1 million state
grant, Pitt will begin the largest re-nova-
tion and construction project since the
building of the Cathedral of Learning in
the 1920s. The money comes from
Governor Robert Casey’s “Operation
jump Start” program.

“We are pleased to participate in
Governor Casey’s Operation Jump Start
and grateful to the governor and the
General Assembly for providing this
opportunity,” Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor said. _

“We would like it to be next to

Hillman Library, but that may not be
possible for problems we haven’t fore-
seen,” O'Connor said.
-A $28 million academic complex of
offices, classrooms and labs. This com-

  Therapy

could help men

in contemporary society

By Rebecca Baker
Staff‘ Writer

Richard L. Meth, author of “Men in
Therapy” and professor at the University
of Connecticut, gave his views about men
in contemporary society to an audience
of mental health professionals at Pitt dur-
ing an all-day conference on Friday.

Meth spoke about men’s relationships
with women. “Men and women really
misunderstand each other’s behaviors,”
he said. “There’s a lot of posturing, like

- ‘I’m right, you’re wrong.”’

According to Meth, the judgement
errors made by women and men stem
from the fact that men communicate bet-
ter on a physical and sexual level, while
women relate on more of an emotional
and social level. _ - ’

“While women say ‘I need to feel emo-
tionally intimate before I have sex,’ men
say ‘I feel emotionally intimate after sex,”’
Meth said. ,

“Men and women speak different lan-
guages because of the levels on which
they communicate,” he said. “When men

say ‘I'm private about my feelings,’ it’s a
euphemism for ‘I’m unaware of my feel-
ings.”’ V

Meth also examined the emotional iso-
lation men often go through. “Most men

move away from fulfilling their emotional.

needs. There is an ‘I have to be strong’
attitude that evolves. When men go into
therapy, they really don’t know why they
need to talk. They’re unaware that the
process alone can be helpful. They just
want to know the outcome,” Meth said.

Meth also discussed men’s relationships
with their fathers. He encouraged men to
recall early -images of their fathers by ask-
ing questions such as “What was he like?”
and “Was he a strict disciplinarian?”

Meth’s book, co-written by Robert ‘S.
Pasick, approaches the role of therapy in
helping men understand themselves and
the world around them. Meth also said
that college—age men go through the
same types of emotional conﬂicts as
older men, except that college-age men
straddle a line between non—traditional
and traditional ideologies about dealing
with various emotions.

depression
screening

By Holly Affeltranger
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
Center, Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic,
United Mental Health and the
National Depressive/Manic
Depressive Association spon-
sored a free depression screen-
ing last Thursday that was held
as a part of Mental Health
Awareness Week.

The depression screening
included a video presentation
and print information on
depression, a lecture on adult
and child depression and a
depression questionnaire’ was
distributed.

The video presentation
viewed was called “Depression:
The Storm Within.” This video
showed several cases of people
with depression and their
agony of coping with depres-
sion to their progress in thera-
py. * _

Associate Director of th
Mood Disorder Module Dr.
Haskett lectured on adult
depression during the screen-
ing.

“Depression is used for very
normal and understanding feel-
ings that we all have at differ-
ent times,” Haskett said. “And
the same word is also used for
a significant, severe and dis-
turbing illness that people will
suffer repeatedly. So one of the
first things to things we have to
talk about is what exactly we
mean by depression.”

Depression has many more
symptoms than just feeling
down. Some of the symptoms
of depression include: moodi-
ness, irritability, decreased
energy, changes in eating pat-
terns and sleeping patterns,
negative outlook toward the
future and the loss of interest
in activities that before seemed
pleasurable. People who have
most of these warning signs
will not get help for them-
selves.

Day of Action may
aid Arhuaco Indians

By David Weimer
For The Pitt News

Members of Pitt's Amnesty International may
have been disappointed with student response
to their Day of Action as they waited for a
crowd that never came.

“Someone’s life is on this table, not some .

ideology out in space,” said Chris Chrysovergis,
group coordinator, referring to stacks of infor-
mation sheets and petitions.

Chrysovergis and Amnesty International sup-
porter John Merritt set up a display table in the
William Pitt Union as an attempt to gain sup-
port for the,Arhuaco Indians, an indigenous
population in Santa Maria, Columbia, that has
become victim to human rights violations.

Amnesty International decided to hold its
petition drive and letter writing campaign on
Oct. 12 “because it’s Columbus Day, and what

happened 500 years ago is still happening

today,” Chrysovergis said.

According to Chrysovergis, Amnesty
International is trying to raise the awareness
that human rights violations are still occurring
today around the world in the forms-of torture,
extrajudicial execution and government-sup-
ported disappearances. -

Many students walked by the display show-
ing only passing interest in a poster that the
wind kept blowing over.

A petition on the table sported a handful of
signatures, and there were about as many let-
ters written by students. j

“Apathy,” Merritt said. “We’re here, and the

people know we’re here.”

“If you really care about freedom of expres-
sion you should stop and sign [the petitions

and letters], it only takes 10 seconds,” Merritt

said.

Amnesty International at Pitt sponsors
urgent—action letter writing tables each week
for those students interested in the plight of
the Arhuaco Indians and other international
causes.

African-‘American artists
celebrate their heritage

By Beth Kovaly
Staff Writer

Local African-American artists
are showcased this week in the
William Pitt Union art gallery.

The seventh annual “Images
From Pittsburgh Black Artists: A
Celebration of a Heritage,” fea-
tures 20 area artists and their
work in the Union’s Conney M.
Kimbo Gallery.

Pieces range from the traditional
— watercolors, acrylic and pencil
— to the unique — oil and sand,
nail sculptures and gesso on can-
vas. There are paintings and pho-
tography in color or black and
white. ‘

Vice Chancellor of Student
Affairs William Harmon and his
executive assistant Gary Houston
have worked to bring the show
into its seventh year.

Houston said the exhibit was
originally begun by the former
student affairs Vice Chancellor,
Conney M. Kimbo, for African-
American artists in the Pittsburgh
and western Pennsylvania area.

“I think Dr. Kimbo, when he
started the show, felt that there
was a lot of African—American tal-
ent in the area that wasn’t given
an -opportunity to exhibit their
works,” Houston said. “He wanted
to provide the general community
with that opportunity.”

The art is judged by a juror,
who is asked to select four of the
best works exhibited. The top
four artists receive $250 each. The
juror this year was Pitt graduate
William E. Strickland, who has
been involved in many cultural
and arts organizations, including

One of the winning pieces,
“Phoenix,” is a wood construction
by Elizabeth Asche Douglas. It is
rich wood carved in shapes,
curves and solid blocks rising
upward in swirling patterns.

Douglas is a Pitt and Carnegie
Mellon graduate whose works are
in private and permanent collec-
tions. She has had several one-
artist shows.

The art works are also available
for purchase. “Phoenix”-sells for
$925.

Houston filled in the back-
ground of a second artist.

“Carlos Peterson, one of last
year’s award winners, deals in a
wide range of things, from purely
creative to commercial art  a
very accomplished artist,”
Houston said. Peterson also
received an award this year.

A third work on display is
“Unseen People,” an oil on canvas
by Herbert Edwards. It shows a
couple walking on the street look-
ing straight ahead, as homeless
people sit on the sidewalk and
watch them stroll by.

"We have had students in the
past, but we haven't had any this
year," Houston said.

Houston said the art show
receives favorable comments each
year, from both the artists and
from people who come to see it.

“Last year, people  with Alcoa
downtown were so impressed
they contacted a lot of the artists
and took [the show] down to the
PPG building,” he said.

The show will continue from
now until Oct. 17.

Pitt gears up for this year’s l-fnited

By Frank Porco
Staff Writer

Four hundred thousand dollars is a
lot of money. But Pitt plans to exceed
last year’s United Way campaign
amount by 10 to 20 percent this year.

But according to Bernie Koperek,
assistant vice chancellor of Special
Services, Pitt is expecting a bit of a
struggle to reach its goal because of
all the controversy surrounding the
United Way’s former President
William Aramony, who resigned in

February.

According to Koperek, more people
are going to be at the poverty line or
below this year with the shape of the
economy. This means that all the peo-
ple who are going to be at poverty
level are at risk of being short on
clothing, food and probably educa-
tion.

“There are 170,000 citizens who are
below poverty level in our area,
56,000 of these are children,” Koperek
said.

Koperek said that the United Way is

an agency that steps in before the
government agencies do, providing
the early intervention measures such
as teaching people new skills.

At Pitt, Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor recruited Vice Chancellor
for Student Affairs William Harmon
to be chairperson of this committee.
Harmon then recruited volunteers
who will meet with United Way rep-
resentatives. The volunteers and rep-
resentatives will plan schedules for
the campaign, according to Koperek.

The university has cooperated with

the United Way for over 20 years,
Koperek said. Pitt has just come off a
successful campaign last year where it
increased the year’s donation by 13
percent.

The faculty and staff have options
of how they can contribute. They can
either take a payroll deduction or
write a check.

“Pitt people have been generous
supporters of the United Way. We

don’t like to pressure them, we just 

call on them to make a decision,”
Koperek said.

When Pitt’s Resident
Student Association formed in
1973, it combined the Men’s
Dorm Council and Won1en’s
Housing Board as one gov-
erning body.

From the start, RSA was not
only overcoming the preju-
dices against women in posi-
tions of power but also specu-
lation by the university about
the need for a student organi-
zation to govern the welfare
of students living in residence
halls. —
After meeting with universi-

ty officials, RSA was granted

an office and recognized as a

student organization.

-The RSA Office is currently

a renovated storage room

1 located between the Tower A
_ :Hand-in-Hand Office and the
A lobby of Tower A. To" this

day, RSA still operates out of
the original office it estab-
lished 19 years ago.

RSA’s purpose is to serve as
the united voice of Pitt stu-
dents living in the residence
halls. Created by students for
other students, RSA exists to
help provide an atmosphere
conducive to individual and
group experiences for the
5,000 students living in 11 res-
idence halls.

“As Pitt students, it is our
right to change the university
to suit the needs of the stu-
dents and administration
equally,” Vice President
Michael Metrik said.

RSA isresponsible for rec-
ommending revisions of hous-
ing policies and rules, striving
to improve the living environ-

ment in residence halls, pro-

moting social activities on
campus and responding to
student concerns on ways to
improve the university.
Students are ._unaware_ of
RSA because about four years
ago, student apathy allowed
the university administration
to begin enacting decisions

RSA improves living conditions

concerning student welfare,
RSA ofﬁcers said.

Once the students delegat-
ed their authority they
reduced the power that stu-
dents, especially RSA, had in
enacting decisions within the
university.

The upcoming year is
intended to be the rebirth of

RSA. To begin this uprise, RSA

is going to review all policies
dealing with the welfare of
students.

RSA President Dina
Scardamalia said, “We [the
officers] believe that there
comes a definite time for
change, and we believe the
time is now.”

RSA is the organization that
once did, and once again will,
bring the needed changes to
the university.

Peace COTPS are loo/eing
for a few good volunteers

By David Weimer
For The Pitt News

The Peace Corps wants to
increase its number of volunteers
from 6,800 to 8,000 by 1993
“because of all the countries in
Eastern Europe opening up,”
Frank Higdon, the Corps’ campus
representative, said.

Historically they have done well
at Pitt, Higdon said. Each year
about 50 applicants from the uni-
versity are nominated to take part
in Peace Corps programs.

In 1961, the Kennedy adminis-
tration established the Peace
Corps to give Americans the
opportunity to participate in inter-
national development. The Corps
has a grass roots focus, and vol-
unteers work in small villages,
said Higdon.

It has three missions: to teach
people to help themselves, to.
educate people in other countries
about Americans and to teach
Americans about people of other
cultures.

While he was there, he made
close friends with the people.

“I’ve been back about four
times,” Balia said. “The ties don’t
wither away that easily.”

Today, the Corps is active in
more than 60 countries, including
Latin America, the Caribbean

islands, Africa, Asia and the newly “ ’

Peace Corps volunteers take
part in the transfonnation of these

The requirements for joining
are simple: have experience or

events. “It’s an opportunity to
understand Latin America.”

Ruiz-Merroth, a volunteer,
said this is the first year
that the “Encounter of the
Continents” has taken place.

She said that the Rosebud
and El Ultimo Cafe have “been
very generous giving time and
space for art exhibits and
artists.”

Connie Acosta, staff member
at the Center for Latin
American Studies, said,‘ “This is
a way of commemorating the
last 500 years. It’s not a tribute
to Columbus but rather a way
of celebrating artistically and
culturally the traditions of Latin
American cultures.”

Security guards at City Center
Mall are participating in a sensi-
tivity training course as a result
of an incident that occurred earli-
er tlfis summer during the Gay
Pride march downtown.

The security guards harassed
and physically attacked partici-
pants of the march for publicly
displaying affection. The issue
was taken to Stonewall Union, a
local gay rights lobbying organi-
zation, so charges could be filed
against the mall. Stonewall
Union set up the courses for
security guards.

Mark Dittmer, office manager
at Stonewall Union, said that
security guards from the mall
will participate in an ongoing
sensitivity training course that
began July 15.

Beer drinkers unite

(T7915 is the first of a semi-regular feature on archaic,
ridiculous laws that we feel need to be repealed)

It’s Sunday. You just got back from breakfast and
yunz are pumped up to watch the Stillers —- but there
is one important ingredient missing — BEER’ L

Because we are cursed to live in a state founded by
Quakers and ruled with Puritan values, we cannot
purchase beer (the staple of tailgating) on game day.

Any Pitt student that has hosted a party ‘on a

Saturday night has experienced the panic and frustra-_

tion that sets in as the midnight hour approaches.
Because when the clock strikes midnight that keg
turns into a pumpkin. In just one example of archaic
Pennsylvania state laws, why is this ordinance still in
effect? What constructive purpose does it serve to pro-
hibit the purchase of alcohol on the Christian Sabbath?
Are our lawmakers just paternalistically trying to save
us from the evils of alcohol?

It is absurd that you can’t buy alcohol in a supermar-
ket or a convenience store in Pennsylvania like you
can in nearly _every other civilized state. Why do our
lawmakers find it necessary to legally separate the
purchase and consumption -of beer from that of non-
alcoholic beverages? Harrisburg is treating us like chil-
dren — incapable of making responsible consumer
decisions concerning alcohol if it is convenient to pur-
chase it. Does the fact that buying beer at the local
beverage center requires more paper work than filing
a police report force us to be more responsible citi-
zens? No. -

The only purpose our current beer laws serve is for
the state to more easily regulate the ﬂow of our cash

, _ and our brew.

Therefore,‘ we need asolution that will solve two
interrelated problems: (1) rid the government of the
regulatory burden and‘(2) allow customers to pur-
chase beer uninhibited. .

Another question is why only on Sunday’s can you
not purchase beer? From sundown on Friday to sun-
rise on Sunday is the Jewish Sabbath. Why is-there no
law protecting the‘ sanctity of that religion’s holy day?
This “Quaker state” is 200 years behind the times con-
cerning this law, and the time for action is now since
we are just beginning the big holiday drinking season.

The beer—loving citizens of Pennsylvania have been
silent too long, and as college students (and major
consumers of alcohol) we have the numbers to form a
powerful special interest group. We must urge‘ our
state legislature to repeal Pennsylvania’s Sunday prohi-
bition law and encourage the free ﬂow of beer.

To paraphrase Karl Marx: The beer drinkers of this
university have nothing to lose but their chains. They
have a world to win. Beer drinkers of Pennsylvanian
universities, unite! ' t A

Pitt needs leadership from instructors

The University of Pittsburgh
boldly announces a sad state of
affairs when it employs TAs
and TF5 that clearly don’ti'want
to or don’t know how to teach.
Please don’t get me wrong,
most TAs at Pitt do a great job.
However, fiscal pressure is so
great on some TAs that many
of them relegate themselves to
the “dregs” of teaching simply
to qualify for financial aid
money. What ever happened to
the TA that has a love for
teaching? Over the years, it has
become apparent to me, that
some TAs have no such love.

A case in point comes to

‘ mind. Recently, I had the plea-

sure of having a TA, whom out

. of respect I won’t_ mention, tell

me in front of the whole class
to, and I quote “shut—up.” Now
perhaps, with me being an

V older student, I am not “with

it." However, not being en
vogue aside, I just can’t seem
to conclude how instructing

students to “shut-up” promotes?

an open learning environment.
This teaching technique seems
to run counter to Pitt’s main
mission —- a quality education.
Department chairs who think
they are budgeting human and

fiscal resources wisely by,

employing inferior quality TAs
like this one, are neglecting
their civic and educational
duties. Everyone loses includ-
ing the community, the univer-

sity, the student and most

importantly —— the TA who
never learns how to teach.
Appointing TAs blindly forfeits
our most important asset, the
nation’s future and prosperity.
Unfortunately, some of those
in a position to remedy the
problem of poor TAs never do
so. They claim, “It’s not my
job,” or “We followed policies
and procedures” or “They are
just undergraduates and they
will go away because they are
not serious.” Do you want to
know why this posture sounds
all too familiar?
_ The problem is that these

folks themselves are followers.
They don’t want to upset the
apple cart that is established
administrative bungling within
their departments. Basically,
these authorities are as afraid of

administrative repercussions as if

am I and the rest of the stu-
dents in my class.
Well, I’m damn tired of fol-

  . Letters 

lowing a group of followers
who promote poor teaching. I
want to be a leader. The only
way I can learn to lead is by
asking lots of questions and
observing other leaders. Too
often, TAs that don’t want. to
teach, as in my case, remind us
exactly of the type of dictatorial
leaders we don’t want to be. In
sum, I guess I am learning
something at Pitt —— how not to
lead.

Unfortunately, I still get the
impression that Pitt is running a
deficit in the leadership field.
We can start improving this
inadequacy’ by establishing
minimum teaching standards
for TAs to follow. This way,
TAs that want to teach will
teach, and TAs that only want
advanced degrees‘ will work in
non—teaching support roles
toward those aspirations. It’s lit-
tle wonder to me then, if Pitt is
a barometer for the rest of the
nation, why an overhaul of the
educational system should be
America’s first charge.

Reimbursement plan crazy

If ' the SGB president is
awardedla full scholarship,
then does it follow that the
leaders of fraternities, honor
organizations, clubs and the
like be awarded? Can you
imagine the hypocrisy come
election time? Who would not
want a ‘full scholarship? I will

not support any election where
my money is going to pay for
someone else’s tuition. In my
opinion, Pitt does not need
“politics” incorporated into the
student representation.

Christine Anicka
Senior, Information Science

I am writing about all the
excitement over the “scholar—

l ‘ ship” or“‘rei"mbursement” that

the SGB president will receive.
I just have one question that I
hope everyone else here at this
university has thought about at
least once: If there's so much
extra money lying around from
our Student Activities fee that
we’re giving it away to one
individual — then why isn’t our
Student Activities fee lower?
Isn’t this place wasting enough
of our money? '

Abortion a private decision

all the ensuingletters I thought
I should write to give one

off with I was once in a Pro-

Life group. Being raised-

Catholic of course it was
through my church. I left the
group realizing that my life
could change drastically if I
simply absorbed the morality
structure of said group. I do

. not consider myself pro—life or

pro—choice. I am simply one
individual who feels I should
have control over my own
body and my own morality. If I
actually got pregnant I honestly
don’t know if I could have an
abortion, but it is not my place
to tell anyone else how to live
their life and I don’t_ want any-
one to tell me how to live
mine. Save this article for when
you’re 25 and see if you agree.

Worker strife
hurts everyone

The past year has witnessed an enor-
mous problem surfacing in Pittsburgh —
labor strikes. The P.A.T. bus strike crip- ,
pled the community physically as The
Pittsburgh Press strike has crippled the
community intellectually. The recent deci-
sion of the E.W. Scripps Company to sell
the Pittsburgh Press has unmasked the
human factor in the dispute.

It is easy to forget that the “players” in
this “game” are" people. People that have
spouses, children and families. People
that will suffer without the income needed .
to survive today.

Before forming your own opinion on
this issue, consider the facts.

The shutdown of the Pittsburgh Press
occurred after the Press locked the team-
sters out of the building. The teamsters
agreed to waive contractual rights for two
years in order to end the dispute. The
Press then escalated its demands.

The two sides were 15 jobs apart -— the
Press wanted to eliminate 275 and the
teamsters agreed to 260. At this point, the
Press increased the number to 325.

These are three tangible facts about the
labor dispute. Mr. McConnell, vice presi-
dential candidate for the International
Teamsters Union No. 7, gave me some
insight on the effect of the strike on
union members.

A total of almost 1,200 employees are
out of work; 1,200 people with obligations
to support their families. Many union

Desmond

members will be forced into early retire-
I ment. Some union members are ...i

aged employees that will be left with no '
other choice but unemployment coinpen—
sation. Although these facts oversimplify
the dispute, they are still accurate.

The point is that the recent disputes in
Pittsburgh are not sporting events. The
two opposing “teams” do not shower and
go home after a match. These are real
people in a real situation. ’

The attitude taken by the E.W. Scripps
Company in its decision to ‘sell The
Pittsburgh Press permeates. our entire soci-
ety. At any point of conflict, bail out. It is
simply easier to turn your back on the
problem then deal with it. I

If you cannot hack reading 100 pages

If you have a fightwith your spouse, get a
divorce.» The divorce rate does not hover
around 50 percent because people try to
solve their marital problems. My mother
used to tell me that the neighborhood brat
that would “take his ball and go home”
had a lot of growing up to do. I am in no
way taking an anti—corporate position. My
parents are not union members, and I
have no relations with any union member.
While I cannot generalize labor-owner dis-
putes based on this one in particular, Ilcan
make a judgement on this strike.

It makes no difference how you View
this dispute because nobody wins. The
workers loose their jobs; the community
loses its paper and the owner loses a
major source of income. Hopefully the
optimistic outlook for all parties will come.
true. E.W. Scripps will sell the Press and
the new owner will settle with the unions
in a humane manner. I have one last com-
ment for E.W. Scripps — take your ball
and go home because nobody wants to
play with you anymore anyway.

Graduateschool bring

To many graduate school
is a career development or
enhancement endeavor that
is not only a measure of
intellectual achievement but
a source of economic secu-
rity and inner satisfaction.
Such an endeavor requires
a person to commit oneself
to one field while either
abandoning other career
choices or putting them on
hold. Given these circum-
stances, graduate students
are at the mercy of the uni-

, versity and, most impor-

tantly, the professors who
take great care in making
decisions about the future.
Unfortunately, it appears
that some — only some —
professors at this institution
do not take this responsibil-
ity seriously, and as a result
the lives and careers of
individuals are treated like
recyclable cans (discarded
by a user who knows that a
new one will be available
when needed and who

. thinks he or she is doing

some social good).

' Recently, a friend of mine
took a Master’s comprehen-
sive exam that would deter-
mine her status as a gradu-
ate student and ultimately,
her career options. After a
period of deliberation, her
committee informed her
that she successfully passed
the exam and would be

this. As she left, she

given the approval to con-
tinue her studies. But when
she received the anticipated

letter, she was disturbed to
discover that she was grant-
ed her Master’s degree but
not permitted to continue
in her graduate studies. The
inability of her committee
to inform her of this distinc-
tion was not the end of this
unsettling problem but only
the beginning.

Upon receiving the letter,

she approached her advisor
to find out why she was
not informed that she

However, the only solution
he could give her was “to

and “to apply to other

how forget two years of her

I answer to the more impor-

tant question: \Vhy was she

ciencies until after her pro-
gram was completed? The

or is it a process in which

ate student are carefully .

addressed by the professor
in order to develop the
intellectual capabilities of
the student?

The experience became
much. worse as she went to
the department’s studerlt.
representative board. The
president of this board with
care and, I am sure, empa-

student boards are just
sources of prestige collec-
tion, where can students
turn to insure that they are
treated in a fair manner
throughout their graduate
experience?

These problems need to
be addressed. They are not
only about administrative
procedure but also, and
more importantly, about
individual lives. Currently
the system of guarding stu-
dent rights is dependent on
the mercy of the professors

and powerless, if not
incompetent, student
boards. This situation

invites some professors to
be irresponsible which can
mean a loss of thousands
of dollars, prestige, eco-
nomic security, self-esteem

and peace of mind for‘

some graduate students.
-_S.tu.de_nts_, at any level,
deserve and should
demand more control in
determining their futures. If

we are committed to con-
stantly promoting a com-
munity of learning and
scholarly endeavor then
students need more of a
voice in building this com-
munity. At the moment,
some students are cement-
ed firmly in a foundation
that is used to build only

the prestige and power of

some professors.

We need to condemn this
wretched old structure, tear
it down and erect a new
one based on the blue-
prints that most professors
already use to help fulfill
the dreams and desires of
all students.

Now I am not arguing for
the creation of a better
objective measurement to
determine the future of
graduate students. We all
know that “objective”
devices have a tendency of
masking ‘the ideological
foundations that hide
behind it. ~

If such a device is creat-
ed, then we will only con-'
tinue to place the burden

-on the student to prove

his/her intelligence while
the responsibility of the
professor and the institution
are ignored.

. I do call for a heightened

‘consciousness of some pro-

fessors to realize the moral
and human obligation they
have to help students
develop the ‘intellectual
capacity that we-all have,

and most importantly, I call

upon students to demand
this basic right and protest
any abuse of it.

Anti-rape artwork on campus insulting

When I came back to my apartment
from mylfraternity house, I had no
idea what I was about to come home
to. One of my roommates pounced
on me as I reached the top of the
stairs.

“I hate feminazis!” .he was scream-
ing at the top of his lungs. “I hate
@#$%&' feminists!”

. Hewas, as most are, disgusted and
appalled by the graffiti work of an
anti—rape and anti-pornography group
around campus. You have probably

_ seen its work. The two most prevalent
pieces of “art” at the University of
Pittsburgh are octagons with the slo-
gans “Stop Raping” and “Dead Men
Don’t Rape.” »

A female classmate (the said radical
feminist) engaged in a discussion with
me and my roommate about these
fine works of art. She adamantly
thought that these slogans “would
make men think twice about raping
women.” Now, most rational people
can understand how amazingly naive
and absurd this statement is and how
this would justifiably make my room-
mate upset.

“So how do you feel about the slo-
gan ‘Dead Men Don’t Rape?” my
roommate asked her.

“Oh, I love that one,” she said with
a smirk. ~

After hearing this, I was able to
understand my roommate’s irritation
about the whole thing.

Here’s the point: “Stop Raping” and
“Dead Men Don’t Rape” are both not
only ineffective at bringing to light
this serious issue, but they are also

counterproductive and offensive.
When I first saw the slogans, I didn't
think of rape. What I thought. of was.
finding the persons who had done
this and breaking their legs off at the

' knees. Was I alone?

Obviously not, as was evidenced by
the tantrum my roommate threw.
These slogans are a huge affront to
men. They assume that 1) a ‘majority

of the male population rape women,

or are planning to do so; and 2) rape
is motivated by a male instinct to
humiliate and degrade women. The

. Nat
Finkin

slogan’s argument is that because
dead men cannot rape women, it
would be better if men were dead.

It’s almost funny until you realize
there are people out there‘ who actu-
ally believe this. Both the assumptions
and the argument, as most reasonable
and intelligent people can figure out,
are irrational and entirely false.

Rape isn’t a crime against women. It
is a crime against nature and society.
And it’s motivated by a psychotic
need to dominate and control the
environment. Unfortunately, the fact
that women are physically inferior to
men makes them the most convenient
target. However, remove women from
the environment (i.e. prison) and rape
still occurs. Only this time it’s against
physically weaker men.

This is not to say that because
women are physically weaker than

men that they ask to be raped. No.
one asks to be raped. But rape is not’

about the degradation of a woman,
and contrary to the belief of these
anti—porn activist groups, it is not
encouraged by pornography.

Watch any pornographic movie.
What you will usually find is a stoic,
unfeeling man being used by a
writhing, lust-filled woman. The

woman shouts out commands to the’

male love-slave who obediently fol-
lows them. How does this portrayal of
‘a man lead to rape? The answer is, it
doesn’t.

I know, I know. People who dis-

agree with this will have volumes of

statistics to shove down my throat.
And what I also know is that most of
the research that is used by anti—rape
and anti-porn groups to substantiate
their claims was compiled by biased
researchers who define rape as “any
act of sex.” V
They feel that all sex is an act of vio-
lence perpetrated against women. The
research and the researchers should
be dismissed as anti—male propagan-
da.
For those of you who sprayed these

slogans on campus or for those of ,

you that actually think that they are
helpful, they aren’t. They are offen-
sive and insulting. The men who rape
others will not be affected by your
slogans. _

And the rest of us will just be
pissed off by them.

Volleyball learns another lesson at ND

‘By Chris Weber
Staff Writer

If this season can be characterized as a learning

experience for the Pitt women’s volleyball team, .

then the 1992 Golden Dome Classic at Notre Dame
this weekend proved that school was in session.
Playing against some of the top competition in
the country, the Panthers showed their inconsisten-
cy and youth, falling in succession to Long Beach
State 7-15, 6-15, 9-15, Notre Dame 6-15, 5-15, 0-15

_ and Florida State 6-15, 15-12, 15-9, 10-15, 11-15.

Pitt is now 7-9 overall, 1-2 in the Big East

, Conference. Despite these defeats, Pitt showed

glimpses of its vast potential, something head
coach Sue Woodstra feels is a victory in itself.
“I’m very proud of our team,” Woodstra said.

I “We matured a lot this weekend, and I am pleased
J with our effort. Our girls never quit trying and that -
A says a lot about their desire to win.”

Pitt began the weekend facing a Long Beach

: State team ranked third in the nation. The 9-1 49ers

boasted a starting lineup featuring two All-

C - I Americans — 5-foot-7-inch senior setter Sabrina

Hernandez and 6’2” middle hitter Danielle Scott. In

«addition, Long Beach also featured 59’ senior

Christine Romero, a powerful outside hitter and

Pitt closed the gap to within four points at 10-6

to be the difference as they dug the ball exception-
ally well and double—blocked Pitt hitters Lucanie

While other teams at Pitt may
attiactmore of the headlines, the
Panther lacrosse team takes a
certain pride in just grabbing
wins + a distinction they have

gladly become accustomed to in ~

the past three years.

The team is coming off of its
most successful season yet, a
third straight Allegheny Lacrosse
League (ALL) title and a dramatic

climb to the championship of last

spri.ng’s Pittsburgh Lacrosse
Shootout. ’

But this year’s team faces a »

new hurdle — and that is uncer-
tainty. _

That uncertainty stems from
the fact that Pitt will no longer be

‘ competing in the ALL but will

join a new league this year —
the National Collegiate Lacrosse

League (NCLL). The NCLL fea-
tures 25 lacrosse teams ranging
from western Pennsylvania to
North Carolina. The NCLL is
comprised of teams from Penn

State, Bucknell, Georgetown and '

Howard University that Pitt has
never played. or scouted before.
This could be a problem for the
Panthers, who became more
than familiar with the members
of their own league.

Pitt will get its first dose of
league action this weekend when
the team travels to Maryland to
compete in the NCLL’s preseason

' fall tournament. Only then will

the Panthers be able to size up
what seems to be stiffer competi-
tion than the previous local
league provided.

Pitt will also compete in the
annual Mountaineer Invitational,
hosted by the University of West

iW0men’s tennis remains in familiar place: last

5 By Tom Schneider

Staﬂ“ Writer

The Pitt women’s tennis team
entered this year’s Big East
Tournament trying to ﬁnish higher
than last place — a spot the team
has occupied since the tourna-
ment began in 1982.

They will have to wait at least
another year to make that dream
come true. ,

The Lady Panthers could not
win a match against the awesome
talent in the Big East, as they once
again ended up at the bottom of
the standings once all of the
points were tallied. ' T h e
No. 14, nationally-ranked Miami
women emerged on top for the

second straight year, surviving a

, scare by upstart Syracuse. The

lady Orange were trying to regain
the Big East title they owned in
1982, ‘84 and ‘85.

The rest of the conference
offered little resistance to these
two juggernauts. The final match’
in every division, singles and dou-
bles, featured a rnatchup of Miami
and Syracuse.

The Orange got off to a surpris-
ingly quick start against the
defending champions winning the
championship match in the first
three rounds of the singles com-
petition. However, the Lady
Hum'canes quickly bounced back

with victories in the ﬁnal three .

singles championship matches as

well as the finals in the top two
divisions of the doubles round.
Syracuse came back to win the
final doubles championship
match but ended up with a final

score of 62 points — just short of
.Miami’s 64. '

The final standings were: Miami
64, Syrac-use 62, Providence
35, Seton Hall 26, Georgetown
23, Boston College 21, Villanova
17, Connecticut 14, St. John’s 7,
Pitt 0. _ .

In the tournament, the Nos. 1
through 6 singles players from
each team competed in six differ-
ent divisions or “ﬂights” ir1 the,sin-
gles round of the tournament.

In Flight A singles, Pitt’_s No. 1
player, Julie LoPrinzi, faced off

-.

against Villanova’s top seed
Carolyn Daley. Daley won in
straight sets (6-1, 6-3). LoPrinzi
faced Boston Coll_ege’s Hope
McAndrew in the consolation pro
set quarterfinals and lost 8-4.

In Flight B singles, Villanova’s
Kelly Barnes, made short work of
Pitt’s No. 2 seed, ﬁrst-year player
Alison Baker, with a straight set
(6-0, 6-0) victory. Baker also lost
her consolation match to Melissa
Robbins of BC, 8-3..

Pitt’s Erika Devins had a tough
chore in her Flight C singles
match as she was pitted against
Corinna Bode of Syracuse.

Bode won a tight battle in the‘

first set and stearnrolled through

the second as she defeated
Devins (7-5, 6-0). Bode
would eventually go on to
win the Flight C singles
crown by defeating Julie
Downs of Miami in the
ﬁnal match [64, 7-6(8-6)].

-Devins lost to Maria
Rapchinski of St. John’s in
her consolation match, 8-5.

The tough competition in
Flights D, E and F was very
unkind to Pitt players Marla
Zielinski, Josie Neiswenter
and Carie Voda. The line
score looked like a Sunday
bagel brunch at Hillel as
the three Lady Panthers
failed to win a game in
their opening matches
against fierce competitors
from Syracuse," Miami and
Villanova.

Zielinski was blanked by

‘Jenna Switzler of Syracuse

(6-0, 6-0), who would
advance to the Flight D
final against Miaini’s
Michelle Fry. Fry won in
straight sets (6-3, 6-3). '

Neiswenter A lost to
Miami’s Bettina Sonneveld
(6-0, 6-0), who went on to
defeat Sara Dickson of
Syracuse in the Flight E
championship match (5-6,
6-0, 60).

Voda dropped her Flight
F match to Vrllanova’s Amy
Santaniello (6-0, 6-0).

In Flight A doubles, Pitt’s
No. 1 team of LoPrinzi and
Devins lost in straight sets
to the University of
Connecticut tandem of
Barrett/Fuller (6-1, 6-2).
They also dropped their
consolation match to
Villanova’s Daley and

Virginia. Last year, the Panthers
managed a strong showing at the
“Mountaineer” but eventually
bowed out in the quarterﬁnals to
the powerful team from SUNY—
Buffalo.

‘ The strength of this year’s
squad is primarily in its depth. As
in the past, the Panthers again
have the luxury of a sizeable and
talented pool of players to exe-
cute their “run—and-gun,” offen-
sive-minded system. S
Returning this year on attack
are Ed Croot and Josh
Gochnauer, whose last season
contributed heavily to the
Panthers highly-touted scoring
attack. At the midfield position
Pitt again will have the services
of Craig Leslie, Darrell Schmitt,
Chris Rice, Eric Kaveny and
explosive scorer Lee Stember to
add to a Panther offense that led
the ALL in scoring last season.
Defensively‘ the Panthers lost a
solid player in Pat Condo.
Fortunately, ‘last season’s
Pittsburgh Lacrosse Shootout
defensive MVP, Luke Fox, will
return along with Jeff John and
Chris Baily. Senior captain Tim
Kenkel will anchor a stingy and

hard-hitting Pitt defense that-

gives up about as many goals per
game as Scrooge did gifts on
Christmas.

In goal, veterans Scott Knowles
and Mike Shiner will both see
plenty of time, and their experi-
ence will be counted on to stabi-
lize the Panthers’ last line of
defense. '

Recruiting is the lifeline of any
successful team. Instead of
rebuilding their program every
year, the Panthers just seem to

reload. In addition to an already
wealthy supply of talent, joining
the team this year are players
Scott Gordon, a transfer from
Wooster College, at attack and a
first-year rear guard from Long
Island, John Foris.

Head coach Gary Neft sees the
fall season as the time when the
new players can assimilate their
skills with those of the veterans
and be ready for the regular sea-
son games and tournaments that
are played in the spring.

“I think  year about four or
five new guys will see extended
time,” ‘Neft said. “One on attack,
one on defense and possibly two
rniddies.”

By season’s start, Neft’s goal is
to be about six deep at the attack
and defensive positions and also
be backed by about three to four
competitive midfield lines.

As strong as this team is, it
does have its weaknesses as well.
Neft said that the team’s biggest
problem is its lack of focus and
poor attendance at practices. This
can be seen at times on the play-
ing field.

The Panthers had a dangerous
tendency to fall behind in games
very quickly last season by four
or five goals at the end of the
first period. Against the sub—par
competition the team faced last
year, the Panthers could rely on
their streaky offense to score 10
to 15 goals per game and pull
themout of even the deepest of
holes. Against the better competi-
tion likely to be confronted in the
new NCLL, such comebacks may
not be possible.

Neft said that to be successful
the team must be better prepared
to play from the start and not

Sleep study needs participants .

 

he University of Pittsburgh seeks volunteers to parti-

have to rely on the late game
surge that was commonplace in
games past.

“Eventually, I want people to
stop taking a starting position for
granted,” Neft said. “We have so
much depth that no one is safe
with a starting position. I think
that will promote an internal
competition for spots on the
team. The most difficult opposi-
tion should be met everyday at
practice.”

Usually upbeat and optimistic
about the team’s chances for the
upcoming season, Neft is a little
more skeptical about his team
this year. He said that all he
wants now is for the team to put
in a good showing at the

Mountaineer and NCLL presea-
son tournaments. Eventually in
the spring, he said that he wants
them to win their division and
qualify for the NCLL playoffs.

“I’ll tell you what, ask me after
Oct. 16 how I think we will do
this season, and I’ll be able to
give you a better answer,” Neft
said.

In addition to the two tourna-
ments, this fall the Panthers will
also play a number of games
against old ALL opponents such
as Carnegie Mellon, Duquesne,
the Pittsburgh Lacrosse Club,
Slippery Rock and West Virginia.
All of the Panther home games
are scheduled to be held at either
Pitt Stadium or the Cost Center.

in game three with good block-

as exceptional serving in clutch

five games.

Early on, Florida State’s 58”

Notre Dame.

-The Panthers came out with
little emotion and quickly fell
behind to the Irish 8-0. Notre
Dame went on to win the game
on a service ace,15—6.

Pitt fared no better in game
two. The Panthers offered little
resistance, making mental errors
on defense as the Irish jumped
out to a 10-1 lead before Pitt
called timeout. The break in the
action only delayed the
inevitable 15-5 Panther loss.

Pitt seemed to wake up in
game three, moving with more
quickness, but was unable to
gain any points on serve. An ace
by Notre Dame broke open the
scoring and the Irish never

looked back. They went‘ on

behind the hitting of outside hit-
ter Christy Peters (13 kills) to
blank Pitt, 15-0. ,

“The younger players started

to assert themselves in that
game, and they showed a lot
more desire which carried over
into the rest of the match,” she
said.

Fueled by the play of Yanik,

along with good digging by 53”
first-year defensive specialist
Laura Horvath, the Panthers
stormed back in game two,
breaking out to a 4-1 lead. Sarah

. Mikla also played well adding to
the inside attack.

“It makes such a difference

"when you have a strong attack
in the middle,” Woodstra said. “It
opens up so many things on the
court for the outside hitters.”

Lucanie benefitted from the

improved attack, blasting kills
against one-on-one blocking to
stake Pitt to an 8-3 lead. The
Seminoles came back, however,
behind the blocking of 6-1 junior
middle blocker Vicki Zinkil,
bringing-Florida State back to tie
the game 10-10.

Yanik, however, rose to the

occasion blocking Zinkil and
delivering a quick kill to -power

Zinkil to a 7-2 advantage and
held off a late Pitt rally for the
15-10 Win.

In game five, Pitt turned to
Lucanie, who garnered 28 kills
for ‘the match, as well as first-
year outside hitter Sara Mitchell.
A"kill by Lucanie pushed Pitt out
to an early 2-1 lead, but Florida
State’s 5’11” sophomore outside
hitter Deanna Bosschaert (.19
kills) made the score 8-6 in favor
of the ‘Noles with a cross-court
smash.

The match went back and
forth until Ramos led the
Seminole charge as they pulled
away to a 15-11 win.

Still, Woodstra said that the
lost match was a victory in its
own way.

"‘I can’t express how pleased I
am with our hustle and desire to
win,” she. said. “These are the
types of games now that we may
not win but with the experience
we gained from this weekend,
we will in the near future. If
thesegames were like mountains
for us to overcome in the past,
they are only small hills for us to
get over now.”

The Lions faced Cal-
