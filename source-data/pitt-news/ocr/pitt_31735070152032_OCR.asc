MEWS BASKETBALL

Duke p
decimates Pitt
late to win

Nate Barnes
A, Sports Editor

The Panthers took an early lead Monday night,
outplaying the Blue Devils in Duke’s ﬁrst visit
to the Petersen Events Center in team history.

But in the game’s ﬁnal nine minutes, No. 17
Duke outplayed No. 18 Pitt to defeat the Pan-
thers 80-65 in a game Duke head coach Mike
Krzyzewski, college basketball’s winningest
coach, called “hard-fought.”

Duke (17-4, 6-2 ACC) outscored Pitt 28-14

after the Blue Devils clung toa 52-51 lead with
9:41 left in the game. The run began with a
3—pointer from Quinn Cook out of a timeout,
then it continued with multiple threes made
by Andre Dawkins, whom Krzyzewski called
the “difference” (in Duke’s 

“We got some looks for him, my players got
looks forhimthen all of a sudden, boom —we
had a double-digit lead,” Krzyzewski said.

Dawkins ﬁnished with 20 points off the
bench and shot 6-of-7 from 3-point range to
account for nearly half of his team’s 13 makes,
the most an opponent has made against Pitt
(18-3, 6-2 ACC) this season.

Jabari Parker led all scorers with 21 points
next to his 11 rebounds. Amile Jefferson also
posted a double-double with 14 points and
10 boards, while Rodney Hood chipped in

0.18 Pitt Monday night at the Petersen Events

Students play the basketball ticket system

Chris Puzia
Stcyj’ Wrz'ter

For fans of Pitt basketball, last night’s game
against Duke may have been the most highly
anticipated home game all year. For other
students, it provided an easy way to make
a quick proﬁt. ’

During the days leading up to the game,
students sold their tickets —— normally sold
online by Pitt’s Athletic Department for $5
each —- through Facebook and other meth-
ods for prices ranging from $20 to more than
$100. Tip—oif for the game took place 7 p.m.
Monday. Doors opened for the game at4 p.m.

Ryan Foley, a sophomore majoring in

employers 

health information management, said he
and his friends split the cost of a $70 ticket so
an additional friend could attend the game.
Foley said he knew a friend from class who
was selling a ticket, so he exchanged money
for the ticket in class.

If demand for a game is=high enough, such
as for last night’s Duke game, the Athletic De—
partment normally awards the tickets based
on a lottery system through which students
who previously attended more games than
others have a better chance of receiving a
ticket. Students who do not receive a ticket
through the lottery process often resort to
purchasing tickets from those students who
did.

In the days leading up to most big-ticket
basketball games, student Facebook groups
— including graduating class pages and a
page titled “Free and For Sale,” through
which students buy and sell items — buzz
with posts from students trying to swap cash
for tickets. This was the case for last night’s
Duke game.

Typically, a student comments or mes-
sages a suggested price to another student,
and once the two parties agree on a fair deal,
they meet at an agreed—upon location to ex-
change the printed ticket for cash. Students
could also email an electronic copy of their

Campaign aims to reduce plastic bag usage  

Luke Raber
Staff Writer

While shopping at the local Giant Eagle
supermarket, Liza Boulet usually becomes
more concerned with other customers’
plastic bag usage than the contents of
her own grocery list.

“I see people putting lunch that they’re
about to eat into a plastic bag, then just
walking around a corner and eating it,”
Boulet said. “It’s very disconcerting.”

Boulet’s concern over this wasteful-
ness spurred her “Bring Your Own Bag”
initiative, which aims to reduce plastic
bag usage on campus through a bag quota
policy starting Feb. 3. Boulet, the student
sustainability coordinator for Pitt’s De-
partment of Housing and Dining Services,
andjess McDonald, the student sustain-
ability coordinator for Sodexo, partnered
to develop the project.

To notify students about the new poli-
cy, Boulet and McDonald, both senioren-
vironmental studies majors, have tabled
in Litchﬁeld Towers Lobby and near the
Quick Zone under Towers since jan. 15,
put up signs near the cash registers in
University dining facilities and created
a Facebook event. They plan to table in
Sutherland Hall and the Cathedral of
Learning, and they have an interview
with WPTS Round Table to spread the
word about their project this week.

The policy limits students to 15 free
plastic bags per semester at University
dining facilities, including Quick Zone
stores in Towers and Sutherland Hall,
Oakland Bakery and Market and the food

Events Center and Cathedral of Learning.

Cashiers will monitor students’ bag
usage by scanning students’ university
IDs if they use a plastic bag at a dining
facility. If students exceed their 15-bag
quota, the cashier will charge them 25
cents per ‘bag. Students can pay the fee
with cash, credit, Dining Dollars or Pan-
ther Funds.  '

Boulet said the cashierwill automati-
cally charge students the 25-cent fee if
they do not have their University ID and
opt to use a plastic bag.

According to Boulet, the initiative
should make students more conscious
of daily habits that may be harmful to
the environment.

In its ﬁrst semester, the fee for_ex-
ceeding the bag quota will only apply to
students. _

McDonald said the fee will not apply to
faculty members because they generally
do not carry their University IDs every-
where, as most students do. ‘

But cashiers will still ask faculty mem-
bers to show theiriUniversity IDs with
their purchases to monitor the total num-
ber of bags used per shopper throughout
the semester. _

If faculty members do not have their
Pitt IDs with them, it will be impossible
to track any bags that they use,'McDon—
ald said.

According to Boulet, depending on the
policy’s success, faculty may be subject
to the bag fee next semester.

Alternative bags will also be available
to reduce the use of plastic bags.

When the policy begins, Sodexo will

Zone stores, which are located in Suther-
land Hall and Litchﬁeld Towers, so stu-

dents can still carry their items without

using plastic bags.

According to Boulet, the price of the
reusable bags is still undecided but will
fall between $2 and $3. if

Jim Earle, the assistant vice chancel-
lor for business.at Pitt, approved‘the
campaign. .

_ Earle, head of the Department of
Housing and Food Services. at Panther
Central, said he hopes. the policy changes
the mindset of the student community.

“It helps to make students aware of
practices that may be harmful to the envi-
ronment and hopefully encourages them
to reduce behavior that could have a nega-
tive environmental impact,” Earle said.

The Student Government Board En-.

vironmental Committee and student or-
ganizations including Free the Planet,
Students for Sustainability, Take Back
the Tap and the Pitt Green Fund, support
the campaign. F

McDonald said an undetermined por-
tion of the bag fee will go to the Pitt Green
Fund, a student—run organization that
helps support and ﬁnance student-led
environmental sustainability projects,
and the rest will go to Sodexo, since the
company will front the cost of the reus-
able bags. V”

Susan Fukushima, Sodexo’s resident
district manager, conﬁrmed t-hat Sodexo
would cover the up-front purchase of the
reusable bags.

ticket and coordinate a later time to exchange A
a money.

In the Oakland Zoo, seating is determined
on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served general admis-
sion basis. As a result, Foley and his friends
landed a spot near the front of the line of eager

fans at the Petersen Events Center by 5:30 '

—p.m. on Sunday waitingto claim their seats for
last night’s game. The group slept overnight

in the Petersen Events Center lobby to secure ~

seats at the front of the Zoo. Foley said _that his
spot in line would inﬂuence his willingness
to purchase a resold ticket to enter the game.

As it stands, the Pitt Athletic Department
has measures in place‘to combat students
reselling tickets to other students.Justin Aci-
emo, assistant athletic director for ticket sales
and operations, said the name on each ticket,
the name on the student’s University ID card

and the name that appears on security staff’s A

scarmers upon scarming the ticket barcode
must match.

Because of this policy tickets cannot be
transferred between students. But students
weigh their options, and some choose to take
the risk. ' _

“Based on the Syracuse game last year, I
would be reluctant to use a resold ticket if I
was at the back of the line,” Foley said. “The,

craziness is gone then, and [security] would .

check your ID more [closely]. At the front of
the line, it can be too crazy for tha .”

Aciemo said the rules the Athletic Depart-
ment has put in place aim to reward students
who have accrued loyalty points by attending
men’s and women’s basketball games. He
said the Athletic Department hasn’t pursued
disciplinary measures against students at-
tempting to use another student’s ticket to
enter games in the past and did not know if
the department would penalize such actions
in the future.

TICKETS

Another tactic students sometimes use is
the alteration of names that are printed on
tickets via image-manipulation software so
that they will match students’ IDs. Students
also sometimes sell multiple copies of the
same ticket. In both of these cases, multiple
tickets will carry the same barcode, which is

assigned to just a single student. Because of »

this, only the ﬁrstperson to have the barcode
scarmed will be able to enter the game —
all others will be, denied admittance by the
security scanners.

Acierno said that to his knowledge, he is
not aware of any student who had achieved-
admittance to attend basketball games in the
Petersen events Center with a re-sold ticket..

Security staif denied Foleys friend admis-
sion at the door because the barcode on his
ticket didn’t scan. But Foley said the hiked
ticket price — $70 — wouldhave been worth
it if his friend got into the game.

“You would remember this game for the
rest of your life,” Foley said via text message
from the line at the Petersen Events Center.
' Aciemo said he’d be receptive to a change

in the system to allow students to transfer p

tickets to one another if students expressed
interest. ' .

“If there’s a consensus -that they’d like
some ﬂexibili , we’re always open to listen-
ing to new ideas from the students,” Acierno

sa1d. A
Acierno added that many systems the

- Athletic Department implements now are

“student-driven.”

“We didn’t come up with the loyalty points
and lottery system on our own,” he said.
“This is all from workingwith the students.”

Although Foley said he would be will-
ing to pay increased amounts for tickets to
big games, he disagrees with the morality
of students proﬁting from other students.

“It is absolutely unethical,” he said. “Their
intentions are purely to make money. They
should help their school out and go instead
of trying to make a quick $100.”

Foley said he is okay with students resell-
ing the tickets, but has an issue with students
who proﬁt from reselling by charging more
than the ticket’s face value.

Nour Shahab, a junior majoring in psy-
chology, said although she disagrees with
students proﬁting from ticket sales, she, too,
paid extra to get one.

, “I really don’t think reselling tickets is
right,” Shahab, who paid $30 for a student
ticket, said. “Students pay $5, and it is unfair,
especially if student buyers have no intention
of going to the game.”

Shahab said getting into the game with a

resold ticket was her main concern, rather
than the University’s policy on reselling

. tickets.

“I just wanted to get into the game,” she
said. “I didn’t want to spend all this money ‘
and still not get into the game.” '

But security staff turned Shahab away at
the door whenshe tried to present her resold
ticket because the ticket wouldn’t scan.

“It’s frustratingbecause I spent the night
at the Pete, and so I wasted so much time,”
she said via text. “They told me my ticketwas
denied and that I had to leave.”

But for some, the business deals are a
wise operation.

Andrew McDonald, a senior majoring
in economics, said he was not awarded a
ticketduring the initial lottery phase, but
he still planned to bargain his way to game
admission. .

In an effort to attend the game without
breaking the bank, he purchased two tickets
— one for $25 and one for $35 — and then
resold one of the tickets for $60.»He kept the
other ticket for himself, ultimately breaking
even in the process.

“I got turned down at ﬁrst [by security
staff] ,” McDonald said. “But then I went and
got the guys ID who I bought the ticket from
and then got in.” _ ‘

McDonald said he had no issue reselling
student tickets to other students to make
a proﬁt. "V '

“In college, you can never pass up an op-
portunity to make a little money,” McDonald
said. “There is no such thing as price gouging
if there is a market for it. I think that bigger
games should cost more to get into instead
of having a lottery system.”

McDonald, like Foley, said there are times
when security does not check tickets closely
enough, and as a result he has never felt com-
pelled to alter a ticket. '

“[Security staff] never pay enough at-
tention to the ticket or ID to know that the
ticket wasn’t mine,” he said. “Getting caught
with a doctored ticket would probably bring
more consequences than using a ticket that
wasn’t mine.”

Last night’s contest against Duke marked
one of the games that every fan would circle
on his or her calendar at the start of the sea-
son, and ticket prices reﬂect that. According
to StubHub, lower level club seats were sold
for more than $1,000. I ‘A

Although student tickets are only $5 for
students who are granted tickets, Foley said
system revisions may need to occur to make
reselling at higher prices more diﬂicult.

“I know a lot of kids with lots of loyalty“
points who did not get tickets,” Foley said. “I
also know people who request tickets just to
resell them. If you want a ticket, you should
be able to get one.” I

COLUMN

Performance-enhancing drugs provide

ethically sound solution to inequality

Natalie Russell
' Columnist

In October 2012, Lance Arm-
strong was stripped of seven Tour
de France titles_ and an Olympic
bronze medal. His charge? Using
performance-enhancing drugs dur-
ing training and competitions. The
widespread backlash he received
speaks volumes about where most
people stand on the issue of using
performance-enhancing drugs: It’s
cheating, and cheating is unethical.

There is little debate in the lat-
ter argument —— that cheating is
unethical — but what’s problematic
about this charge is the ﬁrst part:
thattakingperformance—e-nhancing
drugs is equal to cheating. But writ-
ing it off simply as cheating ignores
reality.

In the fantasy world where win-
ners and losers are sorted out by
their hard work, cunning, skill and
other controllable factors, what’s
too often ignored is the role of
genetics. Hard work and training
aside, athletes whose genes produce
more erythropoietin (EPO) will al-
ways be better disposed to win the
Tour de France. What performance-
enhancing drugs do, in this case, is

artiﬁcially stimulate the right cells
to produce more of the chemicals
necessary for greater stamina,
speed, etc.

In a genetically superior per-
son, the same expression could be
produced naturally. This natural
inequality is considered perfectly
fair to the athletic community, yet
an artiﬁcial equalizing through
performance-enhancing drugs is
deserving of public humiliation.

Protests against performance-
enhancing drugs aren’t entirely
baseless, however, since there is
some truth to the dangers of taking
largerthan the recommendeddose
and catering to your body’s needs
during the recovery process. How-
ever, both of these problems would
be solved through close supervision
by a medical professional. Although
some athletes have the privilege of
obtaining performance-enhancing .
drugs legally, studies have shown
that the majority of players get them
from foreign or underground mar-
kets.

This question is certainly worth
exploring, since Armstrong is far
from alone in his guilt. Between
1996 and 2010, 80 percent ofTour
de France medalists were also ac-

cused of being “tainted by dop-
ing.” But whether it’s steroids for
the Tour de France or Adderall for
ﬁnals week, the relevance —— and
prevalence —- of performance-
enhancing drugs extends beyond
worldwide sporting competitions.
Since it’s commonly accepted
that takingperformance~enhancing
drugs is cheating, there’s no need to
rehash this side of the debate. But
let’s apply this same concept to an
academic setting. Students whose
brains naturally produce higher lev-
els of dopamine and norepineph—
-rine perform better on cognitive
tests than those with lower levels.
So say there are three students
taking a ﬁnal exam: one has natu-
rally high levels of both chemicals,
the second exercises before the test
to “naturally” stimulate a higher
production of the chemicals and a
third takes Adderall to artiﬁcially
increase chemical production. In
the eyes of the academy, only one
student is at fault. The same logic
applied to PEDs used by athletes
also applies to those used by stu-
dents. Without medical supervision,
PEDs for the classroom also come

with the risk of addiction, heart complica-
tions, higher blood pressure, weight loss and
an assortment of other medical problems.
But_once again, it’s worth noting that col-
leges and medical schools have reported a
stimulant abuse rate as high as 43 percent,
meaningthat medically supervised drug use

could dramatically reduce abuse rates on f

campuses across the country.

It should be pointed out that all perfor-
mance—enhancing drugs come with a limit
in terms of mental and physical beneﬁts. At
this limit, the chemicals in question willreach
the maximum capacity for improved per-
formance. A user could theoretically exceed
this level, but this would only have a negative
impact on performance and even threaten the
user’s health. This too—common consequence
is why careﬁ1l,lprofessional monitoringis so
crucial when usingperformance-enhancing
drugs. Misuse and physical harm are much

, more likely when the use of these drugs is

so scandalized. '

If chemical levels were measured and lev-
eled across the board usingperformance—en—
hancing drugs, effort and self—determination
would then become key factors in a competi-
tor’s success. Provided that the drug use is

safe and supervised, it makes logical sense
to allow performance-enhancing drugs in
competitive settings. -

Though there’s some debate in the scien-
tiﬁc community, many studies have conclud-
ed that genetics are the strongest predictors
ofﬁiture success. A high IQ is often correlated
with other genetic advantages, such as physi-
cal attractiveness, good health, mental stabil-
ity, social ﬁtness, height and strength. Higher
IQs are also correlated with higher education
levels, higher incomes, greater marital satis-
faction and generally higher levels of reported
happiness. These possible connections prove
that hard work isn’t usually a determining
factor of success. For most of us, the ﬁxture
is written from birth.

So how should we view these advantages?
Should we shrug them off as the unavoidable
selectiveness of the genetic lottery? Euphe-
mize them with terms such as “giftedness?”
Or present inequality as “diversity” to make
it more palatable? V

The most obvious and easiest solution
would be to chemically equalize these dif-
ferences through the use of performance-
enhancing drugs. Some might feel uneasy
by this proposition, as it has a somewhat
dehumanizing implication: that talent and
the human experience can be reduced to for-

.mulas and functions. But there are so many

LETTER To THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

The American Lung Association in Pennsylvania released its State of Tobacco Control
report card onjan. 22, and .the Keystone State got two ‘F’s — one for poor cessation coverage,
the other for tobacco prevention funding. Not good.

. ’ It frustrates me that despite having a clean indoor air law, the state still allows smoking in

some bars and all casinos in Pennsylvania. That’swhy we only got a ‘C’ grade for “Smokefree Air.”
We should be getting rid of all exemptions to the cleanindoor air —-— and earn an ‘A’ next year!

It hasn’t even been six months since my husband, Bernie, died from lung cancer. There’s
no doubt in my mind that he got that terrible disease from cigarettes.

Bernie smoked formore than 30 years. He tried quitting many times. He tried the patches,
he tried prescription drugs, he tried e~cigarettes, he even tried hypnosis. The science has proven
how addictive nicotine is —— why are we not doing more to help people quit this addiction?

Since Bernie’s death, I’ve vowed to do all I can to spare other families from the heartache I feel
now. I’ve been tellingfamily, friends, anyone who will listen, that we have to do more to increase

smoking cessation programs in Pennsylvania. Let’s get smokers all the help they need to quit. ‘

The American Lung Association is working hard to help smokers quit and to clean up the
air we all breathe. This report reminds everyone there is lots more work to do. Let’s all get
involved — for our loved ones and for ourselves.

Phipps Conservatory’s master gardener,
Dave Buresch, talks about orchids as one
would a lover. He speaks in complex so-
liloquies about their personalities, delicate
beauty and the speciﬁc but simple ways to
care for them. To make an orchid bloom
is an art; to allow one to die is not simply

The room Buresch is in, the temporary
home of more than 100 orchids, is curated
and maintained with the help of the Or-

rounded by the seductive plants and facing
a small group of collectors on the opening
weekend of Phipps’ orchid show, which runs

The orchid’s beauty is elusive, both be-
cause it’s transient — in bloom for only
two to three months — and because it’s
difﬁcult to characterize. The exhibit was
undeniably stunning. The room was almost
radiating with the saturation of color from
gradations as subtle as White speckled with
yellow and as bold as deep purple crawling

white Phalaenopsis orchids. They looked

light on the beauty that makes people like
Buresch love these ﬂowers with such deep
passion.

orchids. According to Buresch, in the 18th

CONCERT REVlEWr

Pixies play with aWe—striking precision at Carnegie Music Hall gs

John Lavanga
A€£>°E Editor

As the last forceful barks of opening act
FIDLAR’s hard—driving single “Cocaine”.
ricocheted around the Carnegie Music
Hall’s ha1f—empty auditorium and the band
took their leave to little fanfare, it was hard
to shake the nagging feeling that Saturday
night’s Pixies concert was going to be a
depressing case of shoving the right hand
into the wrong venue.

This was, after all, the Pixies ~— the
band whose’ greatest tracks bear titles such
as “Debaser” and “Wave of Mutilation.” It
was the band that followed up the release
of their greatest album, Doolittle, with
relentless inﬁghting and an on—stage in-
cident involving frontman Black Francis

chucking a guitar at bass player Kim Deal. .

seats and the eerie sense that the ghost of
Andrew Carnegie was standing up in the
rafters, silently judging the attire of the
fnidd1e—aged ex—punks who made up the
majority of the audience.

The anticipation of disappointment
persisted as the band stepped on to the
stage, sporting the sort of casual attire
that would’ve looked ﬁne at Mr. Small’s
but was rendered pedestrian when juxta-
posed with looming organ pipes and the
decorative plaster ceiling. That band cur-
rently consists of three original members,
Francis, guitaristjoey Santiago and drum-
mer David Lovering, as well as new bass-
ist Paz Lenchantin. Lenchantin replaced
Kim Shattuck, who was ﬁred in November.
Shattuck had previously replaced Deal,
who quit earlier in 2013. _

However, as soon as Lovering counted
the band in for opening song “Bone Ma-

that a lot of black women had to act as

of white women are becoming more vocal

comes with its own set of social changes
and issues — one of which is, “How do

a fraction of society in that title and in

amount of power because she can pass,
but at the same time, marginalized power

pass late in the second half, the referee
asked Pitt freshman forward Michael
Young to take a step back, to give Hood"
more space.

By then, Pitt’s hopes of overcoming
a double-digit deﬁcit were draining, as
were the majority of the shots the Blue
Devils had taken throughout the con—
test, but Young backed off, anyway. The.

rules say he had to. Or maybe he stepped
back because he was used to the move -
the Panthers were allowing that kind of
breathing room all night.

Duke created the offensive space nec-

essary to shoot 13—of—25 from 3-point

range and 48 percent from the field,
lifting the 17th-ranked Blue Devils to.
a 80-65 win against the _18th—ranked
Panthers Monday night at the Petersen
Events Center. T
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said the
formula for opening the court to allow for
the Blue Devils’ uncontested looks was

to exploit Pitt’s defense

just patience and a bit of penetration.

Pitt coach Jamie Dixon agreed.

“Our breakdowns were often, early
and continued throughout the second
half,” Dixon said. “I don’t want to take
away from [Duke] because they made
the shots and they had the patience, but
we simply put ourselves in a hole by not
being able to get shots.” '

Krzyzewski broke down the recipe
a bit more speciﬁcally than those two
ingredients.

“Rasheed [Sulaimon’s] penetration
helped,” Krzyzewski said. “Quinn [Cook]

 penetrated on a couple plays that he
made with Amile [Jefferson], to go along
with what Andre [Dawkins] was doing,
gave usthat margin.”

Krzyzewski named four of his players
who perfected the recipe. But he made
the beneﬁciary of the masterful spacing,
Dawkins, a senior guard, seem like an
afterthought. Yet Dawkins was anything
but, usually the one to cap a clinic on ball
movement with a clean—looking 3-point
jumper.

“Andre, we got some looks for him,”

Krzyzewski said,,quickly interjecting, ‘.

‘.‘My players got looks for him. All of a
sudden, boom, we have a double—digit
lead.” ‘

Dawkins ignited that explosion of a
lead, sinking six of seven 3-pointers and
ﬁnishing with 20 points. But since he
played for just 15 minutes, it was almost
like he found away) for the wick to burn
more quickly thanexpected.

Krzyzewski wasn’t wrong in first say-
ing that Duke provided Dawkins with
the open looks. He made it clear with
his actions on the sideline that the Blue
Devils needed to be busily working the"
ball around.

With a little more than two minutes
to play, Krzyzewski rose from his bench
seat and put one foot forward. He put his
hands together, then pushed them away
from each other, parting the air. His play-
ers noticed, distributed the ball through-
out Pitt’s exhausted defense and went up,
75-62, on a 3-pointer that Dawkins nailed
from the left corner.

“Andre was the difference,” Krzyzews-
ki said. “You go 6-of-7 from three, that’s
pretty darn good. That’s just darn good.”

Krzyzewski wasn’t the only one strug-
gling for the right words after the game
ended and the enthusiasm had been
sucked from the Petersen Events Center.

Sophomore guard James Robinson,
redshirt senior forward Lamar Patterson
and Young sat in the news conference,

She added that some even brought up couches,
from which students watched “a lot of Gram-
mys,” accordingto Kramp. Others passed the
time cookingbacon, hot dogs and s’mores on
a grill outside.

Butthe “Pete Sleepover” wasn’t organized;
rather, it “just happened,” as Shoup explained.

“We didn’t really advertise it just because
we didn’t want to promote people missing
class,” Shoup said. “We kind of planned to
bring doughnuts, to bring pizza, we kind of
planned that kind of stuff. Butwe really didn’t
promote or organize.”

Kramp was a little more open with his
intentions, saying the overnight stay was a
“good excuse to skip class.”

Included in the actual planning was pro—
viding the food mentioned by Shoup. Pitt
head coach Jamie Dixon helped distribute
doughnuts from Dunkin’ Donuts at 9 a.m.,
and students received pizza at noon courtesy
of Chevrolet. "

The real prize, though, wasthe chance for
seats as close as possible to the game’s action ,
Monday night, which made sleeping through
a cold night in the spacious Pete lobby worth
the wait.

“I tried to sleep, which was very challeng-
ing,” Kramp said. “It was really cold in here
at night.”

But if students were adequately prepared,
the night was bearable.

“Inside, it was pretty chilly, but people
stopped coming around midnight, so the
doors weren’t opening anymore,” Shoup said.
“As longas you were on ablanket-—— the ﬂoor
is cold, but it was alright.” A

Others preferred a night in Litchﬁeld
Towers to a night on the ﬂoor at the Pete, as
another group of freshmen found themselves
last in line an hour before the Oakland Zoo
opened its doors at 4 p.m.

John DAlessio, Edwin Mellett,Jim Kearney
and Nick Bittner all had different reasons for
their belated arrival, from Kearney wanting
to sleep in his own bed to Mellettleavingwith
his ﬂoormates simply because they woke him
up from his nap.

A little strategy factored into their plans,
as well. _

“We ﬁgured we’d still geta seat,” D’Alessio
said. “We still want to be inthe upper student
section, that was our goal.”

But why spend a night on aﬂoor, let alone
show up an hour early to wait in line for a
basketball game? Especially when other, more
important games have been played at the Pete
andwillbe played in Pittsburgh (see: vs. No. 2
Syracuse, Feb. 12).

“My dad hates Duke,”‘D’Alessio said. “My
sister goes to North Carolina, so we just hate
Duke.”

Shoup’s passion, however, is relatively _

more Pitt—related.

“VVe’re 9-0 versus the top ﬁve teams, we
have an impact here,” Shoup said. “We have a
great home advantage, so if tl1at’s whatworks,
we might as well keep it going.”ﬁ

with 13 points.

Freshman forward Michael Young,
who guarded Parker for most of the
game, chalked his team’s defensive in.-
ability up to “mental mistakes.”

“We were switching and didn’t
switch, or simple things like hedging,”
Young said. “They just got a lot of open
shots. A lot of open shots lead to a lot
of open makes.” ‘

On the other side of the ball, the Blue
Devils were able to stop Pitt from scor-
ing after the two teams spent the first
30‘ minutes of Monday’s game trading
basket after basket. ‘

The adjustments made in a timeout
helped, but the focus of Duke’s defense
was on one player. ' _

“We started switching a little bit
more, and you just try to make sure
[Lamar] Patterson doesn’t stick daggers
in you,” Krzyzewski said. “He’s such a
big—time.player, so ,_our.,defense of him
throughout the game, but especially
during that period, was critical.”

Patterson, a redshirt senior forward
who was honored earlier" in the day as
the ACC co-Player of the Week for the

- most recent week, scored 14 points but

shot just 4-of-14 from the ﬁeld, because
Hood’s length allowed him to deny the
ball from Patterson in the halfcourt.
“We missed a couple shots in there,
and they did a pretty good job denying
the ball,” sophomore point guardjames

Robinson said. “They rebounded well,
and that led to .us having bad looks on
offense.”

While Patterson couldn’t pull I

his team down the stretch, Dawkins
stretched Duke’s lead to 15 points.

“[Dawkins] was hitting and that gets
you going,”'Patterson said. “Then we
were leaving him open, which wasn’t
smart.”

Because the Panthers couldn’t stop .

the Blue Devils’ devastating perimeter
attack, Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon
pinned the loss on his not having the
defense adequately prepared.

- Late in the game, Dixon also thought
his team was unable to maintain the
focus it had in the first half.

‘-‘We got impatient,” Dixon said. “Ob—

1 viously we were up, then down by one

or two.” .

As the offense went away due to
Duke’s defensive adjustments, so did
Pitt’s chances of winning.

“Us being able to score, we were
able to keep it somewhat close, but for
the whole second half we didn’t play
defense,” Robinson said. “Once we
stopped trading buckets we didn’t get
many stops.”

Even though Pitt stayed close for the
game’s first 30 minutes, Dixon didn’t
disillusion himself with the way his
team defended a potent Duke offense
all game long.

“Our defense wasn’t good enough to
win and our rebounding wasn’t good
enough to win,” Dixon said. “In the sec-
ond half itjust continued.” I

looking dejected, drained and disap-
pointed. Their voices barely rose above
murmurs, and Robinson sported a small
scratch under his left eye —- tangible
evidence of the crushing defeat.

“We made a lot of mental mistakes
on defense,” Young said,'begrudgingly.

 

“We were switching [sometimes], and
didn’t switch [other times], or simple
things like hedging or being slow on
hedges or not being there for rushed,”
he added, laying out the basketball jargon
explaining what prevented the Panthers
from getting a hand in the Blue Devils’
faces.

Then Young simpliﬁed Pitt’s gaffes:
“They just got a lot of open shots. A lot
of open shots lead to a lot of makes.” I
