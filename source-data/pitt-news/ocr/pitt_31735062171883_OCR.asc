Brunetti To Assume

WPGH Leadership

by LORETTA HORRELL
As of April 1, WPGH, the Uni-
versity’s radio station, will be un-
der new management. Bill. Brun-
etti was elected general manager

v of the station Sunday evening.

Two members of the Executive

Board were also selected Sunday‘

evening.

The Executive Board consists of
five members, one of whom is
the general manager who presides
as the committee’s chairman.
Two members are elected and
two members are appointed by
the general manager.

The elected members of the
Board are Joe Wingfield and Phil
Dephanitis. The other two mem-
bers have not yet been appointed
by the manager.

Brunetti has worked at WPGH
since his freshman year at Pitt.
By charting the radio’s progress
of the last three years, Brunetti
has found that the graph of quality
has progressively decreased. He
plans to improve the quality of the
radio station.

Satisfied with the basic music
format and sports coverage,
Brunetti plans to improve news
coverage, advertising, publicity
and editorials.

“I’d like the news broadcasts
to be more than a reading of the
UPI (United Press Internation-
al),” said Brunetti. “I also plan
to have campus events covered
and broadcasted.”

Advertising, purchased by the
campus community and city has
also declined. “Only the ads with
the Pitt News-reciprocal trade
out deal—-has remained constant,”
stated Brunetti. “All other ad-
vertising is practically nil."

 

Lacking the proper publicity.
the station does not appear to at-
tract a large student audience.
Brunetti attributed this to poor
reception in the dormitories and
an uninformed student body.

In an attempt to inform incom-
ing students, Brunetti plans to
distribute a four to five page

pamphlet, describing the station,
the various departments, and
types of programming, to fresh-
men during orientation.

In the past, the general mana-.

ger has rarely exercised his priv-
ilege of editorializing. Brunetti,

. planning to fulfill his responsibil-

ities, feels that editorializing is
not only a privilege, but “a duty"
of the manager.

Three projects: improvement
of trade-out-ads with the Pitt
News, establishment of net-
works with the four branch cam-
puses, and the organization of
monthly meetings with the gen-
eral managers from the two other
college radio stations in the city,
WRCT (Carnegie-Mellon) and
WPPS (Point Park College), also

are a part of Brunetti‘s improve-.

ment strategy.

Millett   Defines Humanist,   
Feminist Perspectives  '

by JUDY VOLLMER
Night Editor

“We must be dedicated to the
idea of non-violent change and to
the growth of humanism.” de-
clared Kate Millett, renowned
feminist, educator, and writer, in
an address here entitled “Sexual
Politics.”

Calling for profound and lasting
institutional and psychological
changes in our present culture in
her talk Monday, Millett said that
the sexual politics that are re-
sponsible for denying women their
humanism can be overcome, “if
our interest is moral. Unless we
take on the characteristics of our
oppressors, we will not become
the oppressor. Intellectual change
could take away the need for vio-
lence and oppression. _

“There is a specter haunting
America,” Millett stated, “that is
sustaining a condescending and
generalized attitude toward Wom-
en’s Liberation. Other movements
are called ‘liberation,’ but we're

patronizingly dubbed ‘lib,’ and put
aside as insincere, and a joke.” *
MEDIA MISREPRESENTS
Millett went on to explain that
the media in America is respon-
sible for misrepresenting the
aims of women in the movement.

“The media is the public rela-
tions outfit of the establishment,
its purpose, trying to keep women
from uniting. The women’s move-
ment is classified as a white, mid-
dle class organization, uncertain
and faction-ridden.

“Since the media is the exclu-
sive information source of the
American people,” Millet added,
“it repeatedly reinforces de-
grading stereotypes of bra-burn-
ing and frenzied rhetoric.”

In actuality, Millet said, the
women’s movement is deeply con-
cerned with economic, cultural,
and psychological differences be-
tween the sexes, differences that
“force women into submissive
roles, in employment and in the
family.”

Greeks to Lead, Adapt

by LEE EILS

The Greek System is‘ not dead,
is not dying, and will probably not
die on American colleges and uni-
versity campuses. Such is the
opinion of Willard F. Rockwell,
Jr., chairman of the board and
chief executive of North Ameri-
can Rockwell Corporation. Rock-
well discussed the future of Greek
societies before assembled
Greeks at Monday nights Alumni
Dinner.

The dinner, sponsored by Pan-
hellenic Association and the Inter
Fraternity Council. was held at
the Hotel Webster Hall and drew
Greeks from the various men‘s
and women‘s fraternities as well
as their alumni, some of whom
were Trustees of the University.

Rockwell raised the question of
whether the Greek system is a
collegiate institution “whose exis-
tence is in jeopardy." Qualifying
his statements with statistical
evidence, Rockwell pointed out
that membership in individual
houseshas dropped three per cent
nationally, but that membership
and number of chapters have
grown nearly 100 per cent in abso-
lute terms. This he interperts as

the potential strength of women's .

and men's fraternities.

During the administration of
Dr. Eric Walker as President of
Penn State, Rockwell was ap-
pointed chairman of an ad hoc
committee to investigate the state
of the Greek system at that uni-
versity.

Rockwell's committee
two primary conclusions from the
study—there exists a need for
both changes in the pledging pro-
grams of Greek Societies and im-
provement in academic achieve-
ment by fraternity men and wom-
en. Rockwell said the latter is
important to advancement in in-
dustry as well as in other fields.

Adaptability to change and,so—
cial responsibility were deline-
ated by Rockwell as two ultimate
goals for Greek societies. Point-
ing to the social revolution oc-
curring in the United States,
Rockwell urged Greek men and
women to “either lead it, stop it,
or get out of it.” Fraternity peo-
ple, he said, “have the opportun-
ity and ability to become more
active than the activists."

Preceeding Mr. Rockwell’s ad-
dress were speeches by Mary
Jane Trunzo, president of Pan-
hellenic Council, and Paul Sym-
zcak, president of the Inter Fra-
tcrrxity Council. Both Trunzo and
Symzcak stressed the need for so-
cial awareness on the part of the
Greeks.

Mary Jane views the role of
women‘s sororities as that of
"collectively working for the ben-
efit of man in society."

“I view the Greek system as a
complete microcosm of society
today.“ commented Paul Sym-
zcak. According to Symzcak. his
efforts will be concentrated in an
all encompassing public relations
program which can sell the Greek

0€F4P4 

drew v

system by demonstrating “the
need for relationships among col-
lege men and women” and the fra-
ternity’s desirability as a means
toward this end.

Rockwell pointed to the fact that
Greek societies are the only cam-
pus institution at Pitt which can
draw 18 per cent of the student
body on a voluntary basis. “Stu-
dents themselves want fraterni-
ties,” he said.

Rockwell, who heads one of the
nation’s 30 largest industrial cor-
porations was a 1935 graduate of
Penn State University and broth-
er of Kappa Sigma fraternity. He
is a past National President of
Kappa Sigma Fraternity and a
former trustee of Penn State and
is presently chairman of the gov-
erning board of Point Park Col-
lege.

In 1969,. Rockwell was appoint-
ed to a three year term as a mem-
ber of President Nixon‘s Citizens

‘ Advisory Committee on Environ-

mental Quality and, in 1970 he was
named vice chairman of the Na-
tional Industrial Pollution Control
Council and a member of the In-
dustry Council for the Depart-
ment of Defense.

by JERRY WEBSTER
Staff Columnist

In her address Monday in the
SU Ballroom, Kate Millett expres-
sed the feminists’ colicern-for
what she jokingly coined “Kid
Lib.”

She saw children as the ulti-
mate victims of the cultural stu-
pidity of sexual prejudice. They
must learn the cruel lessons of
strictly-prescribed social and
temperamental sexual roles, devi-
ations from which bring even
crueler derision and ostracism.

A The bottom of the pecking
order is reserved for them—and
they become the shipping boys
of their mothers’ frustrations.
They are the “chattel” of their
parents just as women are the
“chattel” of their men.

Progressive educators are also
into “Kid Lib.” Listening to Kate,
it seems apparent that women,
as well as children, are the vic-
tims of what Silberman, in “The
Crisis in the Classroom,” calls

. “mindlessness.”

It depends on a total absence
of humanity and on stereotypes,
traditions. and prejudices. Child-

ren today are subjected to treat-
ment everyday that would raise
the roof if applied to an office.

No one expects a businessman
to sit still and quietly all day
behind his desk. ask permission
to use the washroom, or to
accept passively the coercion of
his boss, and yet a child is a
“discipline problem” if he or
she doesn’t do any of those
things.

Children are the victims of
stereotyping just as women are.
How many times have you
heard that little girls are made
of “sugar and spice and.every-
thing nice,”‘ and that little
boys are made of “snips and
snails and puppy dogs’ tails"
and never thought twice? It
seems that most adults look at
children “ as either incorrigible
trouble makers or delightful
little toys to dress up and play
with.

OLDER KIDS USEFUL

When they get older they’re
there to exploit—“take out the
trash! Watch your little sister! ”—

or to boost the ego “Johnny is so 4

good at math, just like his

father." Children are seen as
something nice to have around
the house, sort of like an early
American diningroom set— “be-
cause we like that homey feel-
ing.”

When they’re little they’re
supposed to be cute, when they’re
bigger, they’re supposed to shut
up and get good grades.

At Children’s Hospital, where
I work as a volunteer, I’ve seen
children with beds full of “cute”
stuffed toys and nothing to do.
After all, there are only so many
things you can do with a bed
full of stuffed toys—lie on top of
them, underneath them, throw

them out of the bed, at the other ‘

kid in your room, at your
mother, or at the nurse——and then
you’d get swatted for doing most
of those things, anyways. Rather
than learning what a child is
really like, what its needs and
wants are, most adults are most
concerned with what they’re
“supposed” to be.

I’m not saying that parents
don’t genuinely love their child-'
ren any more than say that men
hate women (actually, I've heard
some rumors that the opposite is
true). Both groups are, how-
ever, the victims of pervasive
and often unconscious preju-
dice.

Progressive educators, whether
they carry the label of Open
Classroom, Integrated Day,
Montessori Method, Summer-
hillian, or Free School, want to
dissolve what John Holt terms
“the myth of childhood," and

develop schools which realize
the real nature of the child.

They throw out the desks, the
text books and the lesson plans
and build exciting and flexible
environments where children
can talk, laugh, move, and really
learn. -They don’t discard the
basic traditional academic skills,
but they tear away the coercive-
ness and compulsion and make
learning the joy it should be.

SCHOOL NOT THE ANSWER

Only part of the child’s life
is spent in the school; it can
never hope to totally undo harm
done in the home. As Kate said,
the responsibiilty of parenthood
“is too important for one per-
son,” especially who has no
other outlet for her frustrations
and feelings of inadequacy but
the home and perhaps a bridge
club and the garden club.

Parents have to learn to love
the child in an accepting, rea-
listic way. They have to re-evalu-
ate their reasons for having
children, for a child that is
nothing but a security blanket
for an insecure mother, or a child
that is conceived to “carry on
the name” is going to have.some
real problems.

Just as women are the interiors
of men, children are the interiors
of women. They are shoved
around by their mothers in the
home, and their teachers in
school. Mothers and teachers
are doubtlessly necessary, but
it’s time to reevaluate their

roles and attitudes.
We’re with you, Kate!

Editor,
I disclaim the direct quota-

tions attributed to me in the ,

article of March 12. In an hour
and a half interview, I stated my

position to Miss Hoenstine both .

calmly and clearly. She was ob-

viously confused when she wrote 7

the article.

Frederick Gottlieb
Assoc. Prof. of Biology '

Conley Right:
Editor : '

I would like to defend Ed Con
ley’s editorial on the Committee

on Student Organizations. This
editorial was recently criticized-

by Charles Liggett, Chairman of
the CS0. .

After turning in the applica-

tion for recognition I had to  
wait more than two weeks for an  
application, A   L’

appointment. . The
stated that an appointment would

be scheduled withina week. The I I '97
meeting with the CS0, . itself,_
was very successful even though‘ so

some of its members never

showed up.

At the meeting I was told that . II 
a letter confirming the club's _ — 

recognition would be sent to

me in a week or two. The letter- . V 
was apparently typed Feb. 3, a

day after our meeting.

I assume then that it began’:

to go through the various chan-
nels of “red tape” on its final!
journey of confirmation. It was
not mailed until March 9, con-
cluding its eight week voyage
through Student Government. '

I believe that any inefficiency‘, 

in Student Government is due to

the bureaucratic structure of the  .

organization. And I, like ~Ed,
hope these problems can be alle-

viated by the new constitution  
and new members of Student A

piece are team-teaching a new course

tury Women Writers. The course Wt"
examine fiction of American women

through use of tapes, records, movies

and informal discussions.

"Even a confirmed feminist

' would have to admit that Nor-

man Mailer’s The Prisoner of
Sex is skillfully, even brilliantly
written. He artfully seduces
us into the essay by several mag-
nanimous admissions. He admits

, that after his fourth divorce he

has retreated to Maine with five
children and a mistress where he
learns by experience the mind-
rotting quality of housework.

. Since he has never been able to

live without a woman, he admits
A that he remains a Prisoner of

‘ Wedlock. On a larger scale, he

is also willing to admit to the
overt economic exploitation of
women. ’ '

Once we are seduced into
the essay, however, we discover
, just how abandoned is the cause
of female equality despite these
easy admissions. For Mailer, far
from seeing a value in equality,
would rather preserve the very
iexploitations and elite drone
hierarchies that help to consti-
tute the problem in the first
place.

Though he admits it is deaden-
ing, Mailer is quite ready to
argue’ that he would refuse to
divide housework with a woman
unless her work were as import-
ant as his. Anyone who has con-

pride in his art would realize
that he would never think that
any woman’s work-short of child-
bearing- was as important as
his own.
cause of art always justified
exploitation and the existence of
\elites?

Mailer’s real gripe with wo-
men’s liberation is, in essence, a
Romantic protest against the
technologizing of sex, for he
would preserve the mysteries
and mystifications that surround
nature, sex, and women. He likes
darkness and dangerous ambigu-
ities. At his outrageous best he
is capable of arguing that the
awesomeness of sex has been
ruined for men ever since the
woman’s fear of death at child-
birth has been removed. From
across the darkling plain of the
battle between the sexes, Mailer
insists» not merely that love is
warfare, but that love is “more
stern than war. ”

Shrouded with the ultimates
of death and dread, sex for Mail-
er is a sacred mystery, a dark
process which humans should
approach with wonder, because
through sex they connect them-
selves with Eternity. The techno-
logical rationality of the pill de-
stroys all this tantalizing ambigu-
ity, because for Mailer the more
deliberate, predictable, and cer-
tain our acts are, the less feeling
and -value, they inspire. Specific-
ally, he fears that woman's de-
mands for liberation will lead
inevitably to extra-uterine gesta-

EXOTIC HYBRID

If Mailer’s enchantment with
mysteries together with his loath-
ing of technology sounds familiar,
it is probably because his argu-
ents place him firmly in the
nineteenth century among the
other great reactionary essayist-
moralists. His major points rep-
resent a sort of exotic hybrid
engendered by the mating of a
Carlyle and a Henry Adams,
with a little Marcuse thrown in
to put people off the scent.

From Adams he inherited
the technique of writing autobi-
ography in tne third person and
the insight that cultural criti-
cism can be made apocalyptic
by opposing woman, and the
meanings that have accumulated
around her, to the world of value
that that technology creates for
itself.

From Carlyle he inherited a
mystico-transcendental biology
(one wonders if Mailer’s women,
lashed by virtue of their wombs
to Eternity, are tied by Carlyle’s
“organic filaments”). He learned
from him, too, the tumbling,
oracular style and the strategy
of liberally sprinkling one’s
arguments with abstract and
mystical terms—Creation, Mys-
tery, God——to create the illusion
of power in one’s prose, a veri-

table divine afflatus that con-

vinces an audience that a prophet
is speaking. -

And Mailer’s contemptuous
rejection of the single, per-
missive sexual standard (be-
cause it is a fake reconciliation
of what has to remain an asym-
metry—man and woman) , is
framed in an argument designed
to resemble Marcuse’s critique
of the one-dimensional man of
modern technological society. '

Finally, one must protest that
Mailer, like Erikson, and Freud,
would confine woman entirely to
the achievments of her biological
nature—her womb“ as the neces-
sary ecological balance to‘ a
male’s ego.

But perhaps we have to con-
vince .Mailer that technology
and life do not have to be in-
exorable opposites; that woman’s

ren, to become an artist, or to

THOMAS NETTER

“I am commencing an undertaking
without precedent."
- - - Daniel Defoe

For many, the essay is a dead
art, having gone the way of rhym-
ed poetry and black and white
film-making. Although it still
appears in such journals. as the
Modern Language Association
and Foreign Policy, by and large
it is considered elite or at least
overly formal. Yet those who do
write essays are often afflicted
with the desire to write minia-
ture doctoral theses, condensed
verbiage full of hackneyed phras-
es and formal transitions. And of
course, there is the usual amount
of squabbling and fighting
over minor points of semantics,
clever use of words to I make
points, the perils of logic, etc.

It ‘is as refreshing as it is
read Normal
Mailer for he departs from tra-
ditional essay-form. In The Pris-
oner of Sex he writes in the third
person as‘ he did in Of a Fire on
the Moon and The Armies of

NORMAN MAILER
the Night. Yet Mailer has out-
done himself this time; writing

 

on moon landings and peace
marches is one thing. Writing
a refutation of the leading
spokesman for Women’s Lib-
eration is another. It is certain
that the "latter of the three is
the more volatile.

MAILER vs. MILLETT .

At this point the review de-
serves a pause; having not read
Sexual Politics, Millett’s refuta-
tion of Mailer, it would be ab-
surd for me to either rational-
ize Mailer or defend Millett. A
book review should not be a
forum for political debate; its
focus should be on the writer and

his work. Let Mailer stand on
what he says; no review could
hope to adequately condense for

mass consumption so sophisti-

cated a debate.

In addition to Mailer, Millett
discusses Miller, Genet and
D. H. Lawrence. Calling her a
literary technician, Mailer pre-
sents his case that Millett has
taken these writers out of
context, made them say what
she wants to say, used them for
the purpose of demonstrating
the amount of male chaurinism
which is rampant in today’s
society. In his refutation, Mail-
er also states his position on Wo-
men’s Liberation, and that
personally, would preserve
older values whether they
decent or not. ’

“BOURBON PRINCE”

Mailer has achieved the status
of “Bourbon Prince” over the
years, and it hasn’t been a re-
sult of his quiet sobriety. A
graduate of Harvard in 1943 he
received a degree in Engineer-
ing, joined the service and
fought in WW II out of which
came his novel. Since then he
has written a number of novels,
but at the present his forte‘
seems to be the non-fiction
essay. or novel, depending on
the length. 4

He has written on the presi-
dential conventions, the marches
on the Pentagon and the moon
launch. It seems oddly coinci-
dental with Millett’s View of
Mailer that he thinks Ernest
Hemingway was the greatest
writer of all time. Rather than
call it emulation (for much of
Richard Brautigan’s writings
are distinctly Hemingwayian)
it seems to be a‘ case of Mailer
and Hemingway being men 'of
the same stripe, both tough,
brutal and having equal ideas
towards alcohol and women.

the
are

‘Yet just as Hemingway saw
a value vacuum in the Post
WWI era in which he wrote,
so Mailer see’s another vacuum
in the post WWII era. Heming-
way sought to establish a new
esthetic, a new form of writ-
ing, showing rather than telling.
Mailer, who many wonder how
he can take himself seriously,
is sly and clever. He writes

prolifically yet at. the same time .

‘Travelers’ T 0 Meet

' by CAROL SCATES

Going Abroad? That’s the top-
ic of a program sponsored by the
Study Abroad Office for students
or faculty planning a year
abroad. Everyone is invited to
attend the program in the S.U.,
March 24th, from 2-5 pm.

Patrick Mechem, Advisor of
the Study Abroad Office begun
in September, stated, “The
program is meant to acquaint
students with all the services
available to assist them in their
plans”. He cited the University
Travel Service and the Immigra-
tion Service as examples.

Hotels, duties, innoculations,
inexpensive means of ‘travel to
and from Europe, and difficul-
ties that a student may get into
while in Europe or in the process
of getting started will be dis-
cussed, as well as any questions
the students may have.

Highlighted will be a panel
of international students, whose
discussion will center around
what students are doing in their
own respective countries, and
how Americans studying there
can _fit in.

.When asked about initiating
the process of going abroad, Mr.
Mechem stated, “Our office, an
advisory center, is a good place
to start. We have various pro-
grams that a student may select.
After he or she chooses a pro-
gram, then their academic ad-
visor must approve of the pro-
gram for obtaining college cre-
dit. Afterwards, arrangements for

He added that language should

not be a deterrent to a student’s
wishes to go abroad, or finan-
ces. “

“Financially”, he stated, “it
costs about the same to attend
the University of Pittsburgh,
give or take a few hundred. It
used to be that only a wealthy
student went abroad. Now that
costs have lowered, our office
would like to help more students
study in Europe.”

The English department has added seven new writing cours-
es to its curriculum for the fall term. Although the new cours-
es are the result of the dropping of the freshman English com- .
position requirement, they are open to all undergraduates and 
cover many aspects of writing. The listing of the courses fol- ’

 Despite missing two regulars (Phil Gefsky, who has a knee in-
Jury and Bill Mantis, who has the flu) the Pitt Ice Hockey Club
 asily defeated the semi-pro Johnstown Junior Jets by the score of

The skaters were led by Dick Solberg who scored twice within
/hirty-three seconds in the furious first period which saw Pitt score a
° enomenal eight goals. The one period outburst matched the team’s
op total in the first game against C.M.U. in which Pitt buried the

Other goal scorers besides Solberg for Pitt were forwards Dick
Van Antwerp, Dave Bahnson, Denny Browne, Bill Glenville, new-

Browne’s brother, Kerry, 2 de-
fenseman, had to leave the game
early in the first period when
he was checked heavily into the
boards and ‘had to have several
stitches administered.

Team captain Joe Testa said
that the game was rough. He
was attacked twice by a “big
fat enraged slob” who charged
Testa and knocked him down be-
fore he was pulled off by the
linesmen; The Johnstown play-
er was assessed a misconduct
while Testa was not given a
penalty.

Testa thought this was hum-
orous and made the mistake of
smiling at the kid. The “enraged
slob came at me like a mad

‘ bull and again knocked me to

the ice and proceded to tear my
clothes off before officials stop-
ped him from completely strip-
ping me,” Testa related. “I got

‘ a few punches in myself,” noted

a smiling Testa.

“It was a very interesting
game, but we slowed down at the
end,” said Testa. Goalie Mark
Lieberman who made twenty
saves remarked that the Jets
“looked pretty good. They
made‘ several good plays that
turned into goals.’ ’

Wessel Diving In Daytime

To Prepare For Nationals

With only eight days left un-
til Nationals, Pitt’s top diver
Dave Wessel, is found practicing
during the day in Trees Pool in-
stead of the normal evening
work-out time. 5

Coach Dick Bradshaw explain-
ed the change in times. “David
will be diving during the day at
the NCAA’s and if you’re not
used to the light intensities they
can throw off a dive. However,

.he will be well set with the pre-

sent work-outs.”

by MIKE MILLER

A two week absence from the
wrestling mat is something most
grapplers would dread. but for
Craig Tritch, it may be the secret
of his success.

Despite the layoff, Tritch was
one of only two Pitt matmen to
qualify for the NCAA tournament
in last Saturdays District Two
regionals. ~

“Around January or February
the wrestling season gets kind of
long," says Tritch. “The guys are
trying to keep their weight down
and they’re working themselves
to death and it gets to be a drag.
It‘s a stale period and I think I
missed it.”

Penn State was on the grapplers’
schedule during the “stale per-
iod” and Tritch found the side-
lines a painful place to be.

“I really. wanted to wrestle
Penn State. It’s a big rivalry. We
kind a hate them for their auda-
city.”

the Nationals. but this year a
qualifying tournament was intro-
duced.

' “I thought I could do the job at
the Easterns. Previously an East-
ern champ had a lot of prestige
but its not that way now. With the
qualifiers it’s different.”

The same optimism prevailed
at the qualifiers.

“I went down there with more
confidence than I had for any dual
meet this year,” said the sopho-
more wrestler. “I thought there
would be no competition. but it
was a differentstory when I got
there.“

To be sent to the Nationals a
wrestler must place in the top
five in his weight class. Tritch
placed sixth, but the fourth place
wrestler decided that he didn’t
want to compete and resigned.

  

Tritch. who helda 6-1 record
at the time of his knee injury. will
head for Auburn University next
weekend for the big tournament.

His chances for success are
“slim and none.“ but he laughed
as he said it.

“But I really have to approach
it with a positive attitude or there
is no use going.”

Despite the slim chance for a
victory, Craig looks forward to
the tournament.

“I want to see what I can do.“

It’s 89 ways better than a Volkswagen.

The car you see before you has almost twice
as much trunk space as the Volkswagen Beetle.

it gives you a smoother ride and a shorter turn-
ing radius than the Beetle.

It even has a longer lasting, more powerful en-
ginetharithe Beetle. .

All told, this car has 89 things you've never

  

 

in fact, it's so superior to the Beetle, we couldn't
call it the Beetle anymore.

So we gave this car, whose mil‘d-mannered ex-
terior masks its ‘true identity, a new name.

We call it SUPER BEETLE. '

what changes you would like to see occur next year by presenting your ideas at the
nominating and election meetings.
