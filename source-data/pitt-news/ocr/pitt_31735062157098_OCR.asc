He’ gained national prominence for the Universitythrough

Sutherland left Piitt after an administrative fracas similar

statement, “I know" Mike and I
know his work. In fact, it Mike
wanted the job, he could come
down here tomorrow and I would
hire him.” .

“I sympathize with Milligan’s
problem and I understand what
he is up against,” he continued.
The Scotchman said that in his
opinion, the Pitt schedule was the
toughest in the country.

In addition, the lack of ade-
quate manpower made the job
doubly hard, he said. When asked

. aboutthe griping of some of the

ballplayers he retorted, “all play-
ers gripe. If they had had a win-
ning season,- they would have
‘ idolized Milligan.”

Sutherland pointed out that

“most of the criticism against Mil-

ligan lay in his supposed lack of

offense.” He discounted this say-

brlng eleven men back each
week.” -

The gaming tables are still
intact at the Phi Ep house,
there’s no padlock on the door,
and four of Lt. Lawrence Ma-

stopped blushing.

Tracking down an illegal
gambling report, the Raiders
visited the North Dithridge fra-
ternity house Saturday night
with the best intentions of ax-
ing up the place in good law
enforcement tradition.

All the elements of a casino
they found; a peep hole door,

“Joe Palooka” until the sleuths
showed their badges, roulette
wheels, dice boards, and piles of
money. Stage money, that is.

Saturday was Monte Carlo

As a result of a tangle between
Helen P. Rush, dean of women,
and Student Congress orators,‘led
by Bob Dickey, Congress’ Consti-
tutional Committee must once
more go behind closed doors and
do a rewrite job on the “Purpose”
clause of the newly rewritten By-
Laws.

Debate hinged on the mystical
connotations of the word “super-
vise.”

The By-Laws are Congress’ code
of regulations, which the Consti-
tutional Committee revised this
year, delegating expanded powers
to Congress through the “Pur-
pose" clause.

But Miss Rush interpreted the
wording of the clause to mean
that Congress might dictate to
WSGA , and the Pan-Hellenic
Council. Miss Rush and members
of Congress produced various in-
terpretations of the “Purpose”
clause.

The passage reads that Student
Congress shall have’ the power

an opportunity to recommend

Court earlier this week.

tion blanks were‘neither votes nor

After an exhausting debate,

T. A. Perkinson seldom was ac-
quainted with the people whom
he supposedly assigned to ignom-
iny by membership in the frater-
nity.

Another characterized Dr. Fer-
guson as “the only professor who
doesn’t treat students as two-year-
olds.”

For further details see also
story on page 5 about Fred
Robie's proposed Panther boy-
cott.

The Council, acting on behalf
of more than 1,000 fraternity men,
met at the Delta Tau Delta house,
4712 Bayard Street.

As accepted by the Council the
motion read: It i s moved that a
letter be sent to the Pitt Panther
with copies to the Pitt News, Dr.
John M. Ferguson and the Publi-
cations Board strongly criticizing
Alpha Sigma Sigma fraternity in
giving dubious honor to Dr. Fer-
guson. Interfraternity Council be-
lieves that a public announcement
would be in order denouncing this
action. -

Louis Johnston, associate professor
of political science and adviser to
Student Congress, made an analy-
sis of the clause which satisﬁed
Miss Rush and all concerned, He
contended that:

1. Student Congress has the
right to study any aspect of Uni-
versity affairs that affect the un-
dergraduate student body.

2. Student Congress might make _

studies and recommendations on

the above to appropriate funds to
University or student organiza-
tions.

3. Student Congress would have
the right to require an informa-
tional report whcnever it wants
to conduct a study.

Miss Rush had no objections to
such an interpretation. Congress
had no real objections. The clause
was eventually reassigned to the
Constitutional Committee for re-
wording, and Congress went on
to pass other features of the bill.

lIoom  for. Dancers
Revelation by Bill Saalbach, office of the

dean of men, that statistically, the Military
Ball was overcrowded brings to a head the

‘problem of what to do with Pitt Dancers.

The need for a large ballroom becomes

,more and more pressing as the student body

takes an increasing interest in student activi-
ties. Last May, the Spring Festival found it-
self in crowded‘ conditions at Hunt Armory———
more than 5000 attended. This year’s Mil Ball

‘ welcomed a. conservatively.estimated.”4000 per-
 The Spring Festival of 1948 has chartered

-Chesarena, _out beyond Aspinwall, in order to
accomodate an expected 5000 dancers.

The problem is more than crowded condi-‘

tions, although this isenough. Actually, be-
cause of the amount ofmoney required to lease
Hunt Armory, Mr. Ticket Buyer isn’t getting
his-money’s worth. Far from it, he continually

ﬁnds himself in the position of the cheated Mr.-
Milquetoast.

Pitt needs facilities for its student body.

This is a requirement long before the famed’

“committees” reports beget action.

Last fall, the University was warned that it
might ﬁnd itself owner of a combination ﬁeld

house and student union. The plan was moving

through to completion when this fair city of
ours, the one which ﬁnds itself compelled to
charge 10% tax on amusements, couldn’t keep
its ﬁngersout of the proposed ﬁeld house. And,
so, the threat neiier materialized. Or, at least,
it is stymied by decidedly loyal local govern-
ment. =

This overcrowding of dances will persist
until Pitt does something to correct the situa-
tion. And correction is in the construction of
a dance floor of sufficient size, ample check-
ing facilities, adequate accoustics . . . a
suretv with the construction of the proposed
Pitt ﬁeld house.‘

.W0rth ‘ Borrowing

. There has been a great deal of talk about .
the place of the college student in the politi-

cal atfairs of his college and his country. Most-
ly, it ’s just talk. Occasionally, however, some
sincere, interested group does -a little serious
thinking and planning. And the results, not
surprisingly, are often good. ' .

The other week the National Intercollegiate

Christian Council’, an organization associated ,

with the YW and YMCA, held a regional con-
ference in Pittsburgh. Part of the discussion
at this meeting centered aroundaprogram for
making college students more effective citi-
zens. A tentative plan was mapped out at the
conference to operate within the framework
of a body to be known as the Commission on
Eﬁective Citizenship. The .commission’s ﬁve
major responsibilities are set forth thusly:
“keep abreast of government policies, select
the issues of most interest to students, make
Christian judgments on them, recommend ac-

tion to the cabinet, keep the campus informed.”
To enable the commission to function effec-

tively, discussions, bulletin boards, lectures
from competent advisers and authorities, and
trips to "see government in action are envision-
ed. Further, the commission is to encourage
students to participate actively in campus poli-
tics and, in so "far as they are able, in national

- politics.

We hold no brief for the NICC, nor for any
of its affiliates. We merely take notice of its
program as an illustration of what can come
out of a conference of college students who are
thinking seriously about meeting a situation.
A similar program, we feel, one somewhat
larger in scope, might help to solve the politi-
cal‘ problem which is apparent on many_ of
the country’s campuses.

 Days. of Barber Shops

 

And Bull Sessions
Beyond Recaﬂ

13,

"'-'—""-—-' William J. Cafrow

I get ill hearing about the “good old days.”
With each new change in American mores ,a pa-
triarch rouses from sentimental memories to con-
demn our rather loosely knit way of ‘life in 1948
A. D. . _

There is something inﬁnitely disgusting to
me in listening‘ to one of the hoary fringe of-
fer an unsolicited description of the great
xolden ‘eras long gone by. But to most of my
aver-sions there usually can be found an ex-
ception. ! occasionally agree with an apostle
of yesteryear . . . about barber shop bull ses-
sions, for instance.

In the old days, men «ranted and gestured and
the barber waved _ his scissors dangerously close
to my ears and, with my father, I would go away
convinced that I had witnessed a conference of
statesmen which no Washington confab could rival
in profound thought and sage decisions.

A few weeks ago I waited my turn in a
barber shop while the men in the‘ chairs\ and
the barbers made verbal" bets on who would
be “Queen For A Day” on the stridently hilar-
ious radio program then in progress.

The program plans call for the selection of a
“queen” from a number of contestants rated by
audience applause on their choice of a prize should
they win the coveted title.

Supporting the male heritage to unqualiﬁed
comfort, the memin the barber shop cast their
votes for the woman who wanted an easy chair
so that she might sit on something other than
the ﬂoor while her husband stretched out on
the living room couch, admittedly the only
article of furniture in the household designed
for sitting. . ,

In competition with women who asked for an
evening at a swank nitery or ,a secluded tete—a—
tete with Errol Flynn, the lady whose posterior
was fast developing ﬂoorboard callouses won, hands
down. . V

The boys in the barber shop were ecstatic
over the victory of their candidate. The whole
agitated world could suddenly have burst in
another attempt of humanity'at self-destruc-
tion’ while one small but typical portion of
the intelligent American public preferred the
supervised giddiness of a woman’s radio show
to the effort entailed in discussion of other f
affairs: political, economic, and social.

As I‘. started to say, this hogwash about the
good old days has the potential for misery incar-
natewbut I’ll concede the cronies a point now and
then. Barber shop quartets may have disappeared
from the American scene with no crippling loss
to our civilization. With the substitution of manu-
factured entertainment for barber shop bull ses-
sions goes another of the few "remaining vestiges
of the cracker barrel democracy that helped make

-our United States a rather nice place for men who

had minds of their own and, even within the
range of my limited memory, had an inclination
to use them once in a while.

Joe Mooney’: Quartet

Music
Notes

"a

Opens Weeks Run

Downtown of Cape

Je.rry Newberg

Opening at the Copa this Monday is a grand
group called the Joe Mooney Quartet. The quar-
tet consists of Joe Mooney (piano and accordian),
Gate Frega (bass), Andy Fritzgerald (clarinet and
sax), and Jack Hotbp (guitar). Mooney does ‘the
arranging, writes many of the tunes, and sings the
vocals in the soft style of Nat “King” Cole.
The quartet gives with a. new brand of
jazz that’s quiet-—even the old school parents
can enjoy these wonderful arrangements. Its
latest Decca release is “Stars In Your Eyes”
backed with ““Lazy Countryside.”

WAX WISE

With the exception of .a number of gifted vo-
calists, few women have attained any considerable
standing in the ﬁeld of popular music. However
there has never been any question about the po-
sition of Hazel Scott as one of the foremost pian-
ists, vocalists, and composers in the popular idiom.
Why the build-up? Well, it’s because of her new
Columbia album “Great Scott.” Miss Scott has
gathered a group of popular songs and several of
her own exciting compositions, playing them with
her own deft and unmistakable touch. The album
contains “Love Me Or Leave Me” 0 “Emaline” 0
“Love Will Find A Way” 0 “Mary Lou” 0
“Dancing On The Ceiling” 0 “Brown Bee Boogie”

A statement of policy from the
Pitt News is certainly in order.

Will the Pitt News continue to
permit itscartoonists to make vi-
cious personal attacks _on students’
who support political views differ-
ing from those of the cartoonist?
Will it continue to devote a con-
siderable amount of space to pro-
pagandizing the poliﬁcal opinions
of its editors in disregard of its"
objective news reporting function?
If the answer to these questions
is “no,” public apology should be

‘Alla Mistake’

The Mystery of the Crowded
Ballroom was clariﬁed but not
completely solved by statements
" from William Saalbach, assistant
, to the dean of men, and Military
-Ball Committee members this
week.

     
 
   
   
   

  

Their explanations followed a 2

cwave of outcries from disgruntled
istudents.
1 Complaints stemmed from the

‘jammed conditions at last Friday’s «
,‘Military Ball. More than a few of -

ithe tickets holders ‘claimed that  '

the number of dancers practically
"precluded the possibility of danc-
ing.

‘All a. Mistake’
According to Saalbach, it was
i, all a mistake. The committee tried
. in vain to ‘‘limit the ticket sale
of 1400.”

But the sudden snowballing

' sales caught the committee mem-
bers unawares. They were una-
j ble to notify salesmen in time to
prevent the purchase of more than
A 1550 tickets——sorne 150 over the
limit.
\ “It was simply a case of not be-
ing able to notifjg our salesmen in
time,” said Saalbach. “We agreed
to call off sales on March 5 when
1200 were gone but by the time
we got in touch with our 30 or
more salesmen they had almost
sold out.”

Final accountings showed that
between 1700 and 1800 tickets
were put in the hands of the
salesmen. Very few were turned
‘ back. .
2300 Tickets Printed

The University printer made up
2300 tickets
members averred that past exper-
ience showed that it was neces-
sary to print nearly double the
amount put on the block.

‘ But Mr. Saalbach refused to ad-
mit that the excess sale was sole-
ly responsible for the crowd
which jammed three dance ﬂoors,
two lounges and overﬂowed into
the hotel bars and nearby cafes.

The dean of men's assistant
concluded that far more people
attended than purchased tickets.
Some, he thought, used pass out
checks. Others simply managed to
sneak past the gate.

. Dance Chairman Frank
Schaughency pointed to the fact
that 1000 pass out’checks were. in
- circulation by mid-evening as evi-
dence that much of the crowding
was caused by poor utilization of
dancing space.

General Walter Love
Biggest Yank of all

Grad *i:lamed
As Top Army
Dental Officer

Brigadier General Walter D.
Love, a 1915 graduate of the Pitt
Dental School and a native of El-
mont, Pa., has been appointed
deputy chief of the dental divi-
sion, office of the surgeon general,
it was announced recently.

A member of the Delta Sigma
Delta and Omicron Kappa Upsi-
lon fraternities, General Love has
seen 31 years service in the Unit-
ed States and numerous foreign
countries. ,

Entering the Army in 1918 as a
Reserve officer, General Love was
commissioned in the Dental Corps
two years later. The General serv-
ed in the United States until 1926
when he was transferred to Tien-
sin, China, where he completed a
three—year tour of duty.

After an assignment to Scho-
ﬁeld Barracks, Hawaii, which end;
ed a year before the Pearl Harbor
attack, General Love was sent to
Fort Knox where he was Camp
Dental Surgeon while the fort was
being expanded and built up as
the home of the Armored Force.
For this service he was awarded
the Army Commendation Ribbon.

In the fall of 1944 he was order-
ed overseas where he served as
chief of the dental service in a
2000-bed General hospital in the
India-Burma thea r. Returning to
the states in March 1946, he was
assigned t the dental division,
office of t e surgeon general, as
chief of the personnel section.

humorous generalizations, snappy
pieces of patter, and brilliant re-

through the Tuck Shops counting
cadence in precise military man-

three saluting (lefthanded) was in
vogue in the area of the elevators
with the operators being the re-

Cries of “they can’t draft me”
and “remember the Alamo” were
two of the favorite expressions.

Although Truman’s speech _ was
hazy in the minds of most the re-
draft of veterans in addition to
UMT seemed deﬁnitely assured
in their ﬁlled heads. Some looked
on it, “if it had to be it had to be"
and they would try to get back
into the good deal from which
they were discharged. One boy

money. He was going to run out

Seventh Floor Paintings

Depict ‘Life of C hrist'

The deeply moving story of
Christ is realistically revealed in
the modern Byzantine style of
Constantine Abanavas’ paintings,
“A Cycle of Religious Paintings,”
on exhibit in the ﬁne arts library
during the month of March. _

American-born Abanavas spent
most of his early youth in the
Greek island of Lemnos, returning
to New York in 1938 to study at
the American Artists school and
later at the Art Students league.

In this, his second one-man.
show, he uses rich stained-glass
color effects, made more startling
by the excessive use of heavy
black patterns and ﬂattened, elon-
gated ﬁgures.

This is especially noticeable in
his composition “Mother and
Child,” which has been claimed
as Abanavas’ most brilliant piece.

Combining free rhythmic strokes
with bold. colors, Mr. Abanavas
has sense of ﬁneness of design, yet
retains the aesthetic effect of his-
work. ,

The tightly drawn “Cruciﬁxion”
and detailed “Descent from the
Cross” are among the more styliz-
ed paintings highlighting the ex-
hibit.

These paintings were recently
on display in the Contemporary
Arts gallery in New York and won
wide acclaim from critics there.
The New York World-Telegram
deﬁned the artist’s work as a
“completely modern idiom to pro-
ject traditional religious subjects.-”

“Resurrection,” holding a prin-
cipal place in the exhibit, reﬂects
the artist’s religious ferver, despite
the distortion of some of the ﬁg-
ures. Similarly the “Head,” though
unreal and odd if taken on the
surface, ‘ shows real beauty and
emotion upon closer inspection.

Student Union

Servesas 'Model Building'

Visitors to an amazing building at the University of Wisconsin

hear comments like this:

“The building does a two million dollar business annually.”

“We serve 60,000 hamburgers
a month!”

They are talking about the Me-
morial Union on the campus —
probably one of the most amazing
college buildings in the world.

The Union boasts ﬁve different
dining halls, a theatre “second on-
ly to Radio |'City,”, workshops and
small stages, hotel rooms, ball-
rooms, and an art gallery. ’

, Boycott of Current 'Puniher'

Fred Robie, instructor in the
speech department, advised his
classes Wednesday to boycott the
Panther magazine on grounds that
it shows “gross indiscretion and
poor ‘taste.”M

Robie referred to the inclusion
of Dr. Ferguson in the Alpha Sig-
ma Sigma article. ..

He said that “To include Dr.
Ferguson in the classiﬁcation of
Alpha Sigma Sigma with all of
its, implications shows a warped
character“ on the part of the indi-
vidual who wrote the feature.”

As a student and instructor at
Pitt, Robie knows Ferguson well.
He feels that Ferguson has done
much fol» school spirit at Pitt by
his continuous support of student
activities.

In Robie’s’estimation the state-
ment “lovable” would be ngarly
accurate, if not placed under the
title of Alpha Sigma Sigma.

—The most effective protest to’

Panther editors against such ma-
terial as Alpha Sigma Sigma is a
student boycott, believes Robie.

All My Sons’ Tops

 

l Year's Dramatics
» By Dick Kovar I
‘‘.All My Sons.” In print that doesn’t mean much of ‘any-
thing; in, print the whole. Pitt Players show is but a skeleton
of a gripping emotional experience that-must be felt.
E c It can be felt in Foster Memorial Hall tonight and tomor-
row night, as it was at last night’s opening and at the dress
,1 rehearsal which prompted this review. ,
F \Vhen Bill Aul. speaks those words near the end of three

.acts of the most awe-provokinge
drama, it is humanly impossible‘

7 to keep your heart anywhere but
in your throat; and even if you
know beforehand the ﬁnal, awful
climax, the shock starts you from
the edge of your seat, where
you’ve been for at least twoiacts.

The play doesn’t need a pro-
fessional cast; the Players don’t
act, they live. No one could read
the lines without being for a mo-
ment one of Arthur Miller’s ordi-
nary persons under the terrible
strain of his unbelievably real
plot. ' I ~

Bill Aul is not a tall, dark en-
gineering student; he is a warm,
-human old man who has made a
human mistake and is slowly re-
alizing how far-reaching the re-
sults of his ‘mistake have become.
And Josephine Bosco is not out of
this world; she is so much a part
of it that she will never be young
Jo Bosco to this writer again; she
is .poor, broken Kate Keller who
has seen her whole world shatter
in a single day.

The second leads, Mel Silver
and Angie Giallombardo, if ,,less
outstanding than the two veteran
players,‘ are no less real in their
characterizations. No one player
could be called the most import-
ant,‘ since the basic idea of the

_ play is to show how completely
one person’s acts affect not only
his immediate neighbors, but can
touch and entangle people not
even remotely connected with him.

“All My Sons” proves its point

,any shouted sermon, or any mor-

alizing essay or novel; yet the
punch of the play is not in its
moral, but in the creation of emo-
tion which is ordinarily only ex-

-perienced ﬁrst-hand.

To even sketch the plot would
be useless; few of. the Broadway
critics who praised “All My Sons”
tried to. But the writer will stake
his position on the News-that a
full house tonight or tomorrow

.night would create a student de-

mand for a return engagement
next week. Compared to the three-
night “All My Sons,” “‘Mable’s
Fable” was. a disgusting waste of
theatre—goers’ money, yet the Cap

and Gown show had crowded and.

even packed houses for almost
two weeks. It ain’t logical!

Contab Holds

Final Session

Three days of training in em-
ployee publications "closed today
as the department of journalism at
the University and the Pittsburgh

Plate Glass Company ended their
conference. V

Final sessions of the conference
were held this morning at 9:30
and featured Dr. Alexander Sil-
verman, head of the chemistry de-
partment and world authority on
glass, who spoke on “The Last
Decade in Glass.”

High spots of the confab were
speakers, headed by Robert X.
Graham, head of the Pitt journal-
ismdepartment, and_Norman L.
Park, company publication man-
ager; a special chapel service, and
a tour of the Nationality Class-
rooms for the delegates.

Attending the conference were
members of the English and Jour-
nalism departments of the Uni-
versity, approximately ﬁfty cor-
respondents representing plants of
the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Com-
pany,‘ writers and editors of the
house bulletins in this district, and
students interested in employee
publications.

Remedy for Cheating

Ind Hands of Faculty A

"Responsibility for the eventful enforcement of an anti—cheating
campaign is going to rest with the faculty according to opinions of
the student -members of the committee investigating the problem.

Atithe recent meeting, views of the faculty members wer sup-
plemented by the student opinions many (if which stated that ac-
tions ‘of the instructors ‘fostered the cheating in certain; courses.
Cited were profs ‘who failed to watch classes during tests or those

who walked from the room during’

exams.

Due to the large body of stu-
dents, of a homogeneous nature,
an honor system would be imprac-
tical if not impossible to adminis-
ter. This opinion concurs with
that of a high University oﬁicial
interviewed earlier.

The student investigators were
nine male students selected by
Men’s council to aid and present
student views to the committee of
deans working on the problem.
The increase of cheating has been
alarming faculty members for sev-
eral semesters and the probe has
been in progress since last No-
vember. ‘

Dean Holbrook of the Engineer-
ing school was in charge of the
meegng ‘devoted to the cheating
problem. One committee member
proposed that a suspension of a
few months, as a penalty for
cheating, would be better than

complete suspension.

Other suggested remedies have
included establishment of faculty
disciplinary committees, in each
of the ‘schools. In answer to the
Chancellor’s request for a uniform
policy for both students and fac-
ulty, the committee is expected to
have a plan for release by the end
of the semester. .

5 Along with Orator John Rozan-

ski they had represented the stu-
dent body on the Committee.

Both Thompson and Lynn ex-
pressed severe disapproval with
downtown newspaper writers who
“have proven in their coverage
that they have not read either re-
port completely. We do not fee ,”
they said, ‘that the portions deal-
ing with personalities were the
most important recommendations.”
A Newspapers Misrepresent

“We recommend seven points.
Only two dealt with personalities.
In fact, only a small fraction of
either report dealt with person-
alities. The newspapers failed to
present a comprehensive picture
of the basic recommendations of
either report.

“Furthermore they made some
statements contradictory to both
reports which proved they had not
given them a thorough reading.

“The public should remember,”
they cautioned, “that this report
was requested by and drawn up
speciﬁcally for the Chancellor of
the University and the Board of
Trustees who already had some
familiarity with the situation.

Not Intended for‘ Public

“Had the intention been to in-
form the public, as the newspa-
pers would have us believe,” they
emphasized, “the report would of
necessity have been more detailed.
We feel, nevertheless, that the
recommendations are speciﬁc.”

, Lynn pointed out, “both reports
were far more in agreement than
the papers have led people to be-
lieve. They deliberately over-

Lynn, Thompson Declare
Publicity ‘Unfair’

By John Golightly

commensurate w i t h

Walter" Thompson ,.

Urges “realistic attitude . . ."
looked the positive aspects,” he
said. ‘

Asked what they considered the

most important points in the Stu- ‘

dent—Alumni Committee report,
Thompson and E Lynn readily
agreed to the following:

“First, the University must
adopt a realistic attitude toward
athletics.

Must Deﬁne Powers

“Second, establish a speciﬁc sys- _

tem of channels inthe adminis-
tration of athletics with clearly
deﬁned separation of powers. Suf-
ﬁcient authority should be given

the Department of Athletics for it 
to function efﬁciently and without

delays.
“Third, improve physical facili-

ties for all sports. The University,_
must make a deﬁnite decision im-

mediately as to whether ' or not
Pitt will play ‘big-time’ ‘football.
If we are, facilities and conditions
must be brought up to a level
‘big-time’
schedules.

“We feel that the majority of
students and alumni have made
clear their desire for a return to

the type of football Pitt was 

known for in the ’30’s.

“However, if the decision is to
de-emphasize, F the schedules must
be de-emphasized as well as ma-
terial and facilities. The Univer-
sity and its athletes can no longer

be made to suffer the humiliating

defeats that have become so com-
mon. '
Adopt Deﬁnite Policy

“Our athletics must no longer
be made to pay for ﬁnancial bur-
dens for which they are not re-
sponsible. This situation can be
remedied only by immediate adop-
tion of a deﬁnite, realistic, all-in-
clusive policy.

“Whatever the decision, a con-
certed effort must be made to re-
establish good will with alumni
and students.”

Despite their disappointment
with the adverse publicity and the
“unfair attitude” of the downtown
dailies, they continue to hope a

constructive athletic policy will be p ‘

formulated for the University.

less search for good hurlers, al-
though perhaps not as famous, has
been asdesperate as the Cincin-
nati Reds’ long quest for a left
ﬁelder.

Not since 1941 when the Pan-
former
Pittsburgh Pirate and Cincinnati
Red, and Edgar “Special Deliv-
ery” Jones, now of the Cleveland
Indians, has Mittexjling had a
combination of good pitchers.

But if three promising rookies-—
Rudy Hudec, Miland Mortimer,
and Bill McClurg-—continue their
good form Mitterling may actually
have a pitching staff. Hudec and
McClurg are righthanders and
Mortimer, a southpaw.

Mitterling has tempered his en-
thusiasm over the «trio by caution-
ing that “it’s still too early to
judge their ability» accurately.”
But he conceded that “so far,
they’ve looked very pleasing.”

Old Sarge, however, has been
forced to turn some of his atten-
tion away from the batterymen
when inﬁelders and, outﬁelders
turned out this week. More than
20 appeared and more are still
drifting in.

The number of inﬁeld and out-
ﬁeld candidates was twice as large
last season, but the ‘decrease is
due; largely to the new ruling
which sidetracks ifreshinen from
varsity sports. ’ .

RENO. Nev. ' (IP) —— Changesﬁ _ , ' i —
that could affect the organization V
of every high school in the land
are under consideration now by a
national nine-man committee of
leaders in the education ﬁeld, ac-
cording to Dean F. W. Traner of
the School of Education. Univer-
sity of Nevada.

P u r p o s e of the committee,
known as The Commission on
Life Adjustment. Education for
Youth, is to advise the nation’s
high schools in gearing courses to /
meet needs of the times, Dean
Traner stated, since surveys have
shown that too many young peo-
ple are receiving an obsolete edu-
cation at the present time.

The conventional high school
course today is planned on the as-

sumption that all students will

seek higher education upon grad-_-

, . nation, and is, therefore, directed

 ” ’ more to the entrance requirements

 of institutions of higher education
than to actual living conditions to ‘
be met by the students who do
nat go to college.

Plans of the commission call for
guidance in such down-to-earth
subjects as home and family life,
job hunting, budgeting, use of
leisure time, understanding the
necessity and dignity of all types
of labor, civic responsibility, and
training for democracy.

Dean Traner explained that the
work of. the commission will be
considerably hampered by tradi-

. tional folkways regarding the type‘
 ,_ of work done in high schools, since
the academic subjects demanded
in college entrance requirements
have almost always made up the
substance of the high school cur-
riculum.
