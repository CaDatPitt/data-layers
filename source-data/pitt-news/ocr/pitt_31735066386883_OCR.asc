SGB works
to obtain
Women ’s
Studies
major

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

To fulfill Pitt’s goal of being a
diverse university, Student
Government Board members
Julie . Crowell and Deena
Buchanan said they believe Pitt
needs to offer more in '\X/'omen’s
Studies beyond the certificate
program which is currently in
place.

“A lot of other prestigious uni-
versities have a Women’s
Studies major,” Buchanan said.
“Pitt has a certificate program,
but most people don’t even
reali7.e it exists.”

According to Crowell, other
universities such as Temple
have extensive programs
including an undergraduate
major and a graduate program.
Crowell said when she contact-
ed other schools in the Urban
13 cohcerning their Women’s
Studies program,‘she found that
many schools offered various
options.

“lOther schools] would ask if I
wanted to speak with the
\X/omen’s Studies center,
women’s academics center or
the women’s major center,” said
Crowell. “If someone would call
Pitt to inquire about a women’s
program, they would get one
small office.”

Crowell said Pitt’s lack of
Women’s Studies options islout
of place in the Urban 13.

“[Pitt] is comparable with
these schools in statistically and
in other areas," Crowell said.
“But [Pitt] offers no more than a
certificate program in Women's
Studies."

Buchanan said it is possible
for students to design a major
with the Women:‘s Studies pro-
gram at Pitt, but it is a difficult
process.

Because of the bad weather in January,
the Inter-Fraternity Council voted to have a

second spring rush this week.

IFC President Brian Rifkin said the num-
ber of pledges was down. “Usually we get
130,” Rifkin said, but the number of
pledges for the first rush totaled 101.

Rifkin emphasized that rush was not just
for first-year students, but also for upper-

class students.

In July, the Black Studies Department will be
knownas the Africana Studies Department.

Brenda lierrian, chairperson of the department.
said the department focuses on the perspectives
of blacks in Africa and Africa’s diaspora.

“While there are black people in Europe and
Canada, there are large numbers of blacks in the
U.S. and the Caribbean." lierrian said.

The department, which was founded in 1968,
was started because nothing was being taught
about African—Americans at Pitt. according to

With 44 students majoring in Black Studies. and

as electives, the program is growing.

Dennis Brutus, a professor from the. depart-
ment, has been on sabbatical for most of the

welcome the changes because it indicates a
broader study area.

“There is a growing interest both in Africa and
African—American issues,” Brutus said.

Interdisciplinary majors not alienated from grad school, jobs

By Jennifer Sikora
Staff Writer

(Editors Note: This is the sec-
ond part of a two-part series on
tbe Liberal Studies Opt-ion.)

Interdisciplinary Studies
majors may wonder about grad-
uate school and employment
prospects, particularly since
their degree is self—designed and
often perceived as generic.

Formerly known as Liberal
Studies, the title of the degree

was changed this semester to
one that would better describe
the program, according to CAS
Advising Director Fred Koloc.

“‘When you think of Liberal
Studies  people think that it's
not a real major,” said Liberal
Studies student Mark Czap.

“I like the new name better
because it -is interdisciplinary,”
said junior Elizabeth Mania,
who designed an International
Studies program.

,_Registered for the fall of 1993

were 153 Liberal Studies stu-
dents, each having designed
their own programs. But despite
the changed name of the
degree, all students in the pro-
gram receive a Bachelor of Arts
in Interdisciplinary Studies.
There is no provision on the
transcripts to list the names of
the main concentrations of each
program or to title each pro-
gram differently, according to
Koloc. That means all
Interdisciplinary, Studies majors

have degree titles that are indis-
tinguishable from each other.
To prevent giving an unfo-
cused impression during job
interviews, Koloc said he rec-
ommends that students list their
concentration titles on their
resume and bring copies of
their programs to interviews.
“Once lemployersl hear what
Interdisciplinary Studies is,
they’ll realize it’s a good thing,”
said Koloc. “The idea behind

starting Liberal Studies was to

make your college education dc
exactly what you want it to do.”
He said students should be con-
fident and proud, not apolo-
getic.

“I think it is different than a
more general degree  because
an employer may not know
what the student wants,” said

May. In order to overcome neg-
ative perceptions, she said

RSA sponsors u romantic ride on tlae river

Byjennifer McGinnis
For The Pitt News
The Resident Student

Association is winding up
its year of activities with
the annual semi-formal
Valentine’s Cruise this Fri-
day on the Gateway Clipper
Fleet.

Tickets for the Feb. 11 event
are being sold all this week in
the Towers Lobby for $15 per
couple and $8 per single.

The eveningwill kick off
with a free jazz concert
featuring the Heinz Chapel
Choir at 9 p.m. in the William
Pitt Union’s Blue Room.
Beginning at 1() p.m., three

buses will leave from the union,
providing students with free
transportation to the Gateway
Clipper Fleet at Station Square.

Representatives from the RSA
will collect tickets and board
students starting at 10:50 p.m.
Students will be asked to show
identification upon boarding if
they wish to take advantage of
the cash bar on the boat. Disk
jockey Todd Neufeld will pro-
vide music while the boat emis-
es from 11 p.111. to 2 21.111.

RSA president Meg Ott said
that dress for the semi-formal
can be  basically anything but
jeans.” Women wear dresses
that range from “Sunday best” to
eveninggowns or old prom

dresses, while men generally
wear a suit and tie.

After the Valentine’s Cruise,
the RSA will shift its focus to
planning for next year. RSA will
hold elections for new execu-
tive officers between Feb. 28
and March 1. RSA is also plan-
ning an end of the year banquet
for all residence hall council
officers, advisors and executive
board members in late March or
early April and a retreat for the
newly-elected and departing
officers.

Ott said the purpose of RSA is
to  serve as a liaison between
the students and the administra-
tion  RSA tries to find out the
likes and dislikes of students

and helps students adjust to res-
idence hall life, she said.

In the past, RSA has spon-
sored student services such as
refrigerator rentals, fruit basket
sales during finals, an annual
blood drive and the Holland
Hall Haunted House each fall.
RSA also worked with the
administration to get cable into
the residence halls.

All students who live in resi-
dence halls are automatically
members of RSA. Ott said that if
students want to become more
involved in RSA activities, they
can do so by attending their hall
council’s monthly meetings and
voicing their opinions to their
representatives.

tact with so’meone else
from another race or culture
daily, and it’s worth get-
ting to know what others
have had to go through as a
race.

Brenda Gordon, a first-year
student at Pitt recently complet-
ed a Contemporary Black
Drama course.

“I like to act, and because
it’s a black course I thought
it would be different,”
said Gordon.

“It was coming from an
African perspective, and you
learn different things about
Africa and Kuntu drama,” she
added.

Gordon said the course got
people out of their shells and
could possibly lead to a broader
interest in African culture. ,

Another student who took
courses from this department
out of interest in the African cul-
ture was Laura Steinig.

Steinig, who took
Introduction to Africa and
History of Caribbean Slavery,
said that her initial reasons for
taking the classes were to fill a
foreign culture requirement, but
after attending a few lectures
she took an interest in the mate-
rial being taught.

Steinig said she learned a lot
about African customs, religion
and politics.

“Because I’m Jewish, I know
the history of my people and
what they have been through,”
she said, “but black people have
been persecuted for years and
years, and I wanted to learn

their history.”

dents need to present them-
selves as creative and career-
minded.

“There are some Liberal
Studies majors who are very
marketable,” said May. She
said the best job candidates
are those who have high
grade point averages, active
involvement in campus orga-
nizations, leadership roles and
experience related to their
major.

May also said Interdiscipli-
nary Studies students may find
it easier to get into careers
usually restricted to certain
degrees. She said students
should make an extra effort to
market themselves because
employers often look at the
total package, not just the
major.

“I think most students who
take [Interdisciplinary Studiesl
are self-starters,” said Mania. “I

think it shows you take initia-
tive, that you’re more multi-
dimensional.”

“As long as people don’t use
it as an excuse to not commit
to anything,” said Marti
Moore, a career counseling
coordinator. Moore also said a
graduate’s major is not an
important attribute listed by
employers.

Moore, who works with
undergraduates needing
career guidance, said students
should take advantage of col-
lege by doing purposeful
work. Her list, like May’s,
included student activities,
leadership roles, internships
and related work experience.

Interdisciplinary Studies stu-
dents can count up to six
credits in internships toward
their degree. For those whose
programs involve Internation-
al Studies, Study Abroad can
also be included as part of

their major.

Czap, who designed a pre-
elementary education degree,
said he used to be worried
about getting into graduate
school. He said Interdiscipli-
nary Studies provided him
with the well-rounded educa-
tion desired in teachers.

Some graduate schools do
not base admissions decisions
on a student's major. Jane
Lohman, assistant dean for the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs, said a
self-designed degree can work
in a students favor.

“It is definitely a bonus
because it shows extra effort
and motivation,” said Lohman.
“It also shows a sign of inde-
pendence.”

Koloc said potential candi-
dates should not be discour-
aged by pre-existing percep-
tions that the degree is “a joke
 Most people don’t realize

that your major is only one-
fourth of your college educa-
tion." _

Some of the more common
Interdisciplinary Studies pro-
grams are those in pre-ele-
mentary education, Cultural or
International Studies, environ-
mental issues, Com-
munications and Media
Studies and medical/health
issues.

The Advising Center recom-
mends that proposals for the
Interdisciplinary Studies
option be submitted by the.
end of the students sopho-
more year — but no later than
the end of the junior year
(before earning the final 3()
credits of the degree).

“If they’re a potential
Interdisciplinary Studies stu-
dent, they should be. thinking
about it early,” Koloc said. “If
they do it too late, it’s harder
to put it together."

There will be a news writing seminar Saturday from 3 to 5 in 434 WPU.

Buchanan and Crowell
are continuing the work
of previous SGB board

and are hoping to see
some progress soon
when they survey student
groups about the project.
They've recently met
with Marianne Novy, the

well as with Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis

According to Crowell,
they plan to design sur-

“We are drafting a sur-
vey specifically for cer-
tain student groups,”
Crowell said. “We are
also looking to women

port.” ,

Before the survey is
taken, however, Crowell

Self-extinction /eey to diversity

In July, the Black Studies Department will become
the Africana Studies Department. Student Government
Board members are pushing to have the University of
Pittsburgh offer Women’s Studies as a major, not just a

‘certificate. Yet, programs like this should become, in

the words of Professor Jaroslav Pelikan of Yale
University, “self—extincting.”

These programs make a positive contribution to the
university community by expanding the range of sub-
jects that are studied. These programs increase the
awareness of the students, but they also increase the
awareness of the disciplines whose techniques they
use to create their department’s body of material. For
instance, the Africana Studies department has used
social sciences and humanities to promote the study of
blacks and black perspectives. Thus, by being involved
in these areas, it has increased their awareness of these
subjects and perspectives.Women’s Studies has under-
taken a similar approach in addressing concerns which
relate especially to women. Currently, Pitt offers a cer-
tificate in Women’s Studies which allows students to
add a focus on these issues in their regular course of
study. This prevents compartmentalization of these
important issues which have a place in every field of
study.

However, before leaping ahead to create new ‘depart-

ments, the true purpose of these programs must be
made clear. Their goal should be to increase diversity
within the academic departments as opposed to creat-
ing a new department. By creating new departments, it

makes it easier for traditional programs to ignore the ~

contribution of other significant groups. By denying
these .people’s roles, the entire field of study is impov-
erished. Those who would seek a full major in subjects
designed primarily to promote richness in traditional

fields should consider whether. their interest could be

best served by focusing on these subjects within one
of the traditional departments of the university. If not,
then they should make liberal use of the university’s
Interdisciplinary Studies option, which is designed to
open these avenues of study for those students who
have a serious interest in pursuing such studies as a
subject in and of themselves.

Far from being an acceptance of the status quo, mak-
ing such programs self-extincting provides for ﬂexibili-
ty. Because they do not have to take a broad
approach, each department can develop a program of
courses in these different groups which will allow even
those who do not wish to major in these areas to
broaden their own world view. This will allow them to
make a stronger contribution in their own field.

Finally, through the assimilation of these programs
into traditional fields, more groups will come to be
represented and true diversity will finally be achieved.

Teachers’ views

The practice of teachers
using their classrooms as plat-
forms to promote their own
political beliefs is a serious
problem at the University of
Pittsburgh. It is also a problem
that has received virtually no
attention from the studen_t
body, The Pitt News or the uni-
versity’s hierarchy.I wonder if
Chancellor O’Connor has ever
sat in on a class to see firsthand
what kind of faculty the univer-
sity employs. Obviously not,
because if he knew what kind
of radical politics were being
promoted in some of his class-
rooms, he might realize that
he’s wasting his money.

First off, it needs to be said
that I am not attacking Pitt’s
faculty as a whole, but rather

the growing number of select.

teachers who base their cur-
riculum on how they can best
promote their liberal agenda. I
attack liberal teachers solely
because there seem to be so
many. It is rare that one
encountersa college professor
who promotes conservative
ideals, though that would be
just as unfair to students seek-
ing an objective education.

As a film major with a con-
centration in' English literature,
I admit that I have probably
encountered more overgrown
left—wing radicals than the aver-
age student. Indeed, the reign-
ing hero of the English depart-
ment appears to be Karl Marx.

Despite the fact that Marx’s
ideology has failed throughout
the world, many Pitt professors
persist in teaching it. In addi-
tion, a great number of these
teachers use their power to
promotelsocialism, militant
environmentalism, homosexual-
ity, the alleged “oppression” of
the traditional family and of tra-
ditional gender relationships
and, in the case of at least one
prominent history professor,
communism.

Teachers are in a position of
authority in a classroom situa-
tion. The majority of students
will be inclined to believe the

teachers interpretation of the
issues at hand, or at leastgo
along with that interpretation
for the sake of a good grade.

iThe result, particularly in the

case of the former, is a trust in
the professors views. This is
based on the assumption that
the teachers views are more
enlightened than those of the
students.

Realizing that they have this
power to basically brainwash
their students, many have
seized the opportunity to bom-
bard them with their favorite

eradical causes. This political

preaching always comes at the
expense of a quality education.

Last year, for example, I had
the extreme misfortune of
being in a Soviet history class
taught by the aforementioned

Michael
Gilbert

professor. Day after day he
used his power as teacher to
bash the American government,
the Republican Party and the
Reagan era. At the same time,
this historical revisionist praised
the virtues ‘of Karl Marx, coin-
munism, Lenin and even
Joseph Stalin, one of the great
mass murderers of all time. For
our midterm exam, we had a
choice to either write an essay
that rationalized Stalin’s violent
regime in the 19305 or to write
an essay that condemned
Stalin. -

We were advised, however,
that the second choice was
“too hard to prove,” and we
had a better chance of receiv-
ing a high grade if we wrote
the pro-Stalin paper.

For our final exam, we were
asked to fill a blank page of
our exam booklet by writing “I
love Lenin! Long live Lenin!”
The professor even brandished

aren ’t enlightened

a Communist Party me.mber—
ship card one day. How did
this go over with the students?
They loved it, laughing at his
anti-American jokes and falling
for his biased view of history.

Last semester, I was enrolled
in an English class in which vir-
tually every reading assignment
had a liberal message. Class
discussion topics often includ-
ed gay rights, racism and
"inequalities” in family struc-
tures and gender roles.

Any time I raised a conserva=
tive viewpoint on such topics, I
was uniformly hissed and
scoffed at by the other stu-
dents, who obviously had been
numbed into believing the pro-
fessor’s politically—correct agen-
da.

The hypocrisy involved in
this problem is astounding.

Radical Marxists and socialists *-

are accepted as required read-
ing in these courses, and most
students, already caught up in
the radical campus atmosphere,
buy into this politically—correct
garbage.

"At the same time, if a
teacher came into class and
announced that the syllabus
would include such works as
Rush Limbauglfs “The Way
Things Ought to Be,” Howard
Stern’s “Private Parts,” or regu-
lar viewings of “Morton
Downey Jr.” reruns, students
would most certainly rebel. The
teacher would probably be
labeled a sexist, racist homo-
phobe by the student body,
who would probably see to it
that he or she was fired.

Political biases severely deter
students’ ability to objectively
learn. I do not suggest a
McCarthy-style witch hunt, but
I would implore students to
speak out against teachers who
consistently shape their courses
around their own political
views. I urge them to think for
themselves in the future,crather
than buying into their instruc-
tors’ personal opinions.

Pitt’s men’s and women's
gymnastics teams will both try
to overcome injury difficulties at
home this weekend.

Friday at 6 p.m. in Trees Hall
the Lady Panthers will host
Eastern Michigan University. On
Saturday, James Madison comes
to town to face the men (Trees
Hall, 1 p.m.). Then on Sunday
the women travel to Eastern
Michigan to complete this hock-
ey—like home and home. series.

So far, this season has been a
frustrating one for the women's
team. Close losses coupled with
untimely mistakeshave ham-
pered the efforts of this young
bunch.

“We have :1 very talented

team with a lot of desire and
great attitude,” Pitt head coach
Debbie Yohman said." The slow
start can be attributed to injuries
which have affected some key
people.”

Four of these key people who
have suffered serious injuries
are Shannon Brown (hand),
Deena Daller (knee), Tracy
McKenna (tendonitis) and
Michalene Myers (ankle). This
goes without mentioning the
other members of the team who
are injured but still competing.

The team has been led this
year by sophomore Brenda
Stevens and rookie Robyn
Senior.

Stevens has consistently per-
formed well in the all-around
after being limited to uneven
bars last year. ‘ -

Senior has been a pleasant
surprise. to the team.

"Robyn holds the season's
highest all-around score and is
capable of the big performance

on any given night,” Yohman
said.

The team as a whole has
improved with each meet.

“The team has improved in so
many aspects unseen to the
public," said sophomore co-
captain Bethany Toellner. “Our
strength, endurance, mental atti-
tudes, and overall appearance
are 100 percent better than last
year. Every meet we learn from
our mistakes, which can only
make us better.”

The gymnasts most likely to
compete this weekend are
Christine Battista, Lori Buck,
Michelle Cole, Meg Johns,
Senior, Stevens and Toellner.

As for the rest of the season,

Ochs follows hockey

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

Mario Lemieux once spoke of
how his father gave him his first
push towards hockey stardom
very early on, when Mr.
Lemieux poured water on the
living room rug and allowed it
to freeze, giving young Mario
his first skating rink. “

Not surprisingly, tales of cur-
rent NHL stars learning to skate
almost before they learned how
to walk were, and still are,
rather commonplace in
Canada's hinterlands, and even
in the city rinks of Boston and
Minnesota.

It was during this same peri-
od, when the little Lemieuxs
and Gretzkys of the world were
taking their first steps toward
the Hall of Fame, that a young
Harold Ochs was dreaming
those same dreams.

But Ochs, the fiery head
coach of the Pitt Hockey Club.
did not have the luxury of an
ice rink on every corner when
he was growing up. In his
neighborhood. children were

dreaming of playing profession-
al football or baseball.

You could drive for miles and
miles in Harold’s neighborhood,
and you’d probably pass up 10
baseball fields before you hap-
pened upon an ice hockey rink.

It certainly was rough for a
budding hockey talent to grow
up in the steel-mill areas of mid-
196()s Pittsburgh. But that didn't
stop Harold Ochs. '

“When I was six years old, my
father built an ice skating rink in
our backyard," Ochs said. “He
put a bull rope up that we could
hold onto. and after about four
days we were confident enough
that we could skate without the
bull rope, so he took it down.
That was my first ice skating
rink."

Ochs‘ early start on the ice
and lifetime of hockey knowl-
edge have been nothing less
than godsends to the Pitt
Hockey Club.

Last year, the Panthers were a
ship without a rudder, floating
about in an ocean of medioc-
rity. Now. after annihilating the
league's top team on the road.

the team is not looking back.
Senior co—captain Johns said,
“My main goal is to get the team
focused on all the great things
we can accomplish  We have
to start performing to our poten-
tial.”

These sentiments were
repeated by Yohman, who said
that the goals for the rest of the
season are “to continue improv-
ing, especially consistency,
qualify for ECACs and Regionals
while there is still time and
reach our potential and
beyond.”

The men’s team comes beaten
and bruised into Saturday’s
matinee with James Madison.
Injuries have decimated the

Penn State—West, and embar-
rassing one of Pittsburgh’s best
collegiate teams, Duquesne,
they are taking on the form of a
huge ocean liner on a collision
course with the WPCHA cham-
pionship.

“I think these guys can taste
(a championship),” Ochs said.
“We have four or five of the
best players in Pittsburgh on
our team, and all around, we
are good enough to be a cham-
pionship team.

“They had the talent already.
They just needed someone to
lead them in the right direction.”

It’s been a rough road on the
way to the Panther bench for
Ochs.

After finishing his high school
hockey career at nearby Carrick
High, Ochs, like many others at
the time, was unsure of the
direction in which his life was
headed. As the result of a lack
of initiative and a largely care-
free attitude, Ochs lost several
years of his life which could
have been spent on developing
his already—excellent hockey

Panthers’ lineup. Sophomore
Karl Chan is out for the season
with a shoulder injury, and fel-
low sophomore Jason Lannie is
doubtful for the remainder of
the season with an ankle injury
suffered Jan. 15 at Navy.

Junior Mike Solpietro (shoul-
der), sophomore Brian Narvaez
(foot) and rookie Chad
Schieken (ankle) are all ques-
tionable for this weekend.

Genaro Severino, winner of
last weekend’s Great Lakes
Championships All-Arpund
competition, will once again
lead the team. That event was

held at James Madison
University.

Recently I was reading a not-to-be
named Canadian music mag and dis-
covered, to only slight surprise, a

review of the Touch n' Go debut of_

local superheroes of Indie rock, Don
Caballero. In this review "the Don", as
people in the know call them, were
referred to as the best thing ever out
of Pittsburgh- a mighty tall claim, con-
sidering we've had both Dennis Miller
AND Strikin Distance emerge from the
Steel City. I suppose, however, that
Don Caballero (I'm not in the know...)
is worthy of Pittsburghian historical
significance, so perhaps you should go
see what they've learned on their
recent, extensive II.S. tour. The band
will be playing to an almost certainly

charlie kohlhase quintet

Ever since jazz music came to
life over half a century ago, it
hasn’t been uncommon for
musicians to play in more than
one band. Members of big
bands could be found playing
or recording with quintets on
their off—nights. Rhythm sec-
tions of bands found them-
selves pretty busy.

The tradition still carries on
today, and it's no less evident
in the Cambridge, Mass. scene
which houses the jazz label
Accurate Records. Saxophonist
Charlie Kohlhase figures into
the scene, having played with
Either/Orchestra and the
Mandala Octet, in addition to
his own quintet. This Sunday
night, the Kohlhase quintet will
visit the Titled Square
Coffeehouse at Skibo Hall for
an evening of rollicking music.

Kohlhase, who plays both
alto and baritone sax, first
became interested in jazz after
hearing the horn—playing of
Marshall Allen (of Sun Ra’s
Arkestra) and Eric Dolphy. The
music of Roscoe Mitchell of the
Art Ensemble of Chicago and
Thelonious Monk left a strong
impression on him as well.

“When I heard Monk for the
first time, my ears went ‘ding, 
he said in a 1990 interview,
“and they haven’t come down
since.”

Although Kohlhase was pri-
marily self-taught on his instru-

role in New York’s avant garde
jazz scene in the ‘60s. ‘
In 1987, Kohlhase joined the

music and adding a sense of

Twenty Buclas

Directed by Keva Rosenfeld

Written by Leslie and Endre
Bohem

With Elisabeth Shue, Steve
Buscemi, Brendan Fraser and
others

The premise for Keva
Rosenfeld’s first fiction film has
the odor of Richard Linklater’s
S/ac/eer— only instead of wan-
dering after random people, the
camera follows the journey of a
20—dollar bill as it circulates
through various characters and
stories.

If it sounds like a gimmick,
it’s because it is, but fortunately
screenwriters Leslie and Endre
Bohem have managed to use
the twenty-spot as more than a
simple vehicle and incorporate
it cleverly into the many con-
verging plots.

Concerns about money per-
vade the psyche of all the char-
acters in one way or another.
Struggling writer F.mily’s
(Elisabeth Shue) father disap-
proves of her choice of a
poverty-level career. The naive
Frank (Steve Buscemi) lets his
greed get him into trouble with
Christopher Lloyd’s jimmy,
who is sort of the sensei of
knocking off convenience

stores, giving lessons for living
along with criminal training.
(This impression, however,
could be due to the subcon-
scious influence of Shue’s
Karatelﬁd past.)
Like most films that deal with
a lot of loosely connected char-
acters, this film doesn’t allow us
to get truly involved with any
one character enough to inspire
much passion.
’ Rosenfeld is more concerned

with the clever construction of
theendless coincidences that
allow the characters to ricochet
off one another.

This sacrifice of character
depth gives the film a matter-of-
fact, cutesy attitude which could
have proved fatal.

T here; is one crucial moment
where the film teeters on the
edge of the sinkhole of nauseat-
ingly adorable entertainment.

(Brendan Fraser) is offered the
same twenty that threw his life
into a downward spiral a sec-
ond time by a well-meaning
bowler (played by Matt Frewer,
the former Max Headroom).
Had he taken it again and pro-
pelled the film in this direction,
it would now be trying to scrab-
ble its way up the sinkhole
walls with the likes of Macauley
Culkin and the Olson twins.
Fortunately, Rosenfeld avoids
this overly cliched route and
wraps up all his narratives in a

neat, acceptable package.

Twenty Buc/es is often too
cute with its coincidences and
its humor, and it might inspire
in you the desire to smile con-
descendingly at it and pat it on
its head, but hopefully its sin-
cere lack of pretention will
allow you to relax and be enter-

The Frampton Brothers
Don ’r Fall Asleep  Horrible 7791‘ ngs Will Happen
Bogus

After four years, locals The Frampton Brothers
have been places. They had a showcase gig at
CM_I’s Music Marathon in New York City, and they
recorded much of their new album in Seattle.
That album, Don‘? Fall Asleep  Horrible Ylyings
Will Happen offers fifteen rockers straight from
the garage.

Well, it’s a clean garage. Conrad Uno of
Mudhoney and Young Fresh Fellows fame pro-
duced three tracks, and Charlie Chesterman of
Scruffy the Cat produced the others, but it’s not
an underproduced indie gem. It has.a polished
sound, and an even mix of guitar, bass and
drums.

The average song length is a brief two—and—a—
half minutes, and -the Framptons waste no time
filling each with fuzzy guitar hooks and tongue-
in-cheek lyrics.

A perfect example of this style is found on
“Like an Oliver Stone.”

Forget about the Bob Dylan reference in the
title. Singer/guitarist Ed Masley pouts, “I know
that it would be untrue if I were to blame this
whole damn revival on you  an obvious, but
humorous, stab at the director’s obsession with
the ‘60s and the Doors.

The song mixes jerky guitar rhythms and jangly

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, February 10, 1994

arpeggios over a driving rhythm section augment-
ed by an organ played by Burns Stansfield of the
Harmony Rockets. The Iggy Pop scream adds a
nice touch, too. Imagine the Poisies (a Frampton
fave) mixed with Soul Asylum and equipped with
wit.

While Iggy Pop wants to be your dog, the
Framptons want to be your furniture. Four clicks
from Bill Haller’s drumsticks and the song takes

' off in a punky stammer.

The drums are simple, but solid, as is Dave
Vandervoorfs bass playing. Sean Lally is show-
cased with a wah-wah guitar explosion, followed
by a quick droning solo.

In contrast, “Johnny Wonder” sounds like the
10,000 Maniacs meets the Black Crowes. It has a
‘70s guitar vibe coupled with organ (Stanfield)
and mandolin. by Stephen Gredette, both from
the Harmony Rockets. This is the “deep” song.
Masley asks, “Johnny Wonder, I wonder could
you answer me please  why in the world would
the world just bring me to its knees  Word-play
makes it palatable.

Don "t Fall Asleep  offers its listeners a pleas-
ant surprise by digging up R. Dean Taylor’s
“Indiana Wants Me,” a mid—tempo narrative about
running from the law.

Although it was a Top 10 hit in 1970, it is a
refreshing choice, in contrast to recycled Sabbath.
Despite the loud guitars, little is different from the

original. The Harmony Rockets
do a nice job at, uh, supplying
harmonies to Masley’s vocals.
Of course, there is an element
of jest present in this rendition.

One of the members makes
an attempt to mimic the siren
sound at the end of the origi-
nal. The song ends with a cho-
rus of laughter.

This perversity is what sepa-
rates the Frampton Brothers
from one of the countless ‘6C-~
’70s revival bands. They don’t
seem to take themselves too
seriously, and they know how
to be cynical without sounding
elitist or militant.

While some songs border on
the edge of silliness, most are
clever. Along with I)orz’t Fall
Asleep ..., the l3rother’s have
another album, I am (.'urioz.1s
(George), some 7”s and appear
on Bonograpb, a Sonny Bono
tribute that Masley rounded up
featuring the likes of Peter
Holsapple, some Smithereens
and the Young Fresh Fellows.
It’s always nice to find a band
that seems to be having so
much fun. It’s even nicer when
they’re from your’ hometown.

Captain Howdy

“The Best Song Ever Written"
/”Dino’s Head” 7” single
Shimmy Disc

In The Exorcist. Captain
Howdy was the demon that
talked to Linda Blair through
her Ouija board. Now Shimmy
Disc Records has unleashed a
new but equally monstrous
Captain Howdy — a collabora-
tion between the label's head
honcho Kramer and Penn
jillette, the speaking half of the
magic team Penn and Teller.

Though Penn has garnered a
reputation as a comedian/magi-
cian, few people know of his
work as an equally ingenious
singer.

He performed in Bongos,

Bass and Bob (as Bass), an off
the wall trio who released an
album in 1988 which boasted
such unsung classics as
“Temporarily Like Bob Dylan,”
“Gun In My Hand And I’m
Waiting for My Woman,” (he
wants to protect her) and “(I
Wear) The Clothes of The

Dead.”

As a member of bands like
Bongwater and Shockabilly,
Kramer has done his fair share
of twisting with pop music in its
various forms.

His production credits
include local bands ATS and
Boogie Man Smash as well as
King Missile, who started out on
Shimmy Disc.

Both Kramer and Penn like
their work to sound a bit
overblown, and they both ham
it up on “The Best Song Ever
Written,” a backhanded tribute
to classic rock.

A sea of guitars blasts off the
song, and Penn comes roaring
in not long after, setting the
tone of satire.

The song itself is not the best
one ever written. Rather, it
salutes the song. However,
Penn never names it specifical-
ly, only its chord changes: “The
best song ever written goes G-
D-A—D/ I think you can figure
out which I mean/ It has the
chorus that goes ‘Baby, baby,
baby. baby  And the chords

iiirmir la  airs:

Monday, February 14
WPU Room 543 9:15 PM

Mandatory for those competing

    
  

change with every chorus.”
While “The Best Song” doesn’t
come close to the best work of
either guy, it’s not just a one-
joke tune either. In fact, it
improves on repeated listen-

ings.

The real gem comes on
“Dino’s Head.” The B-side
recalls Bongwater’s finer

moments, when Kramer accom-
panied Ann Magnuson’s surreal-
ist/black humor monologues.
The Captains seem to realize the
comparison since the piece
ends up trashing the former
Bongwater vocalist indirectly.

“Dino’s Head” starts with
Penn telling a very detailed
story about performing in Las
Vegas and his attemptto get a
decent shower in his dressing
room.

In a way that only Penn can
do it, he transforms himself into
“a redhaired actress on a situa-

~.—.

S‘-7
tion comedy” who decides to be
a “mainstream-sub-star—lyric—
writing person" for alternative
bands, juxtaposing mainstream
acceptance with indie rock
credibility.

Anyone
Bongwater’s history knows that
Kramer and Magnuson, who fits
the above description, had a
falling out over the above issue,

who knows

resulting in the demise of the
band.

Yet the fact that Kramer and
Penn decided to sensationalize
the issue on a record almost
makes them seem kind of petty.

But who cares? These guys
thrive on walking the fine line
between humor and obnoxious-
ness.

Besides, Penn rambles so elo-
quently that you can’t help but
feel amused.

of gay men swooning over that
fierce diva. What they share,
however, is ‘an obsession.

The opera queen appears to
be overwhelmed with the joy of
opera. Each opera queen has
favorite arias and especially an
obsession with a diva. \‘(’ith the
attention of an antique enthusi-
ast, detail to the dame is crucial.

Opera queens have to know
every nuance. Any self—respect—

A diva. too, may act like a star

Party.” In the album’s liner notes
for that song, Kohlhase said,
“Suppose Mothra did meet
Frankieand Annette.” He wrote
“Dyani” as a salute to the late
South African bassist johnny
Dyani. At the time of the
recording, the quintet featured
the front line of two saxes and a
trombone, a twist on the usual
horn section. “It occurred to me
a while back that I’d never
heard this particular combina-
tion before,” Kohlhase said.
“There’s a lot of

out there, but I don’t know of

THE PI'IT ms,  pa;

Who wants to be No. 1 in
men’s college basketball this
year?

The crown of No. 1 has been
passed around like a hot potato,
and the polls have had more
changes than Michael Jackson’s
face.

There have been six different
teams in the top spot, and eight
times overall there has been a
new No. 1 team. Kentucky,
Arkansas, Kansas, UCLA, Duke
and North Carolina (three times)
have all reigned supreme.

Defending champ North
Carolina, who is No. 1 for now,
seemed like the elite team in the
preseason — with the rest of
the teams battling it out for sec-
ond. The Tarheels looked
unstoppable on paper after they
got top recruits Rasheed
Wallace and Jerry Stackhouse
and only lost George Lynch to
the NBA.

But that’s not the case. Parity
dominates the college ranks,

Best of college hoops continue to do No. 1 shuffle

and as a result, the Top 25 poll ‘

is in disarray.

College basketball hasn’t seen
so many changes since the 1988
season when Doug Smith’s
Missouri Tigers played volley-
ball with the No. 1 ranking with
the potent Oklahoma Sooners
(Stacey King, Harvey Grant and
Mookie Blaylock). Then, out of
nowhere, Danny Manning and
the Kansas Jayhawks came from
the depths of the NCAA
Tournament to win it all.

No one wants to claim No. 1
— in fact, no one can even stay
at the top for over a week.

Carolina lost to UMass in the
Tip-off Tournament to start the
season off — opening the door
for the Hogs of Arkansas.
Apparently, the Hogs weren’t
Hogwild enough because they
lost to Florida within a week.
You get my point.

Finally, UCLA looked like
they would be a legitimate No.
1 team. With Ed and Charles
O’Bannon, point guard Tyus
Edney and 7-foot—1—inch George
Zitek, they looked for real. But
as recent history would have it,
another PAC-10 (the Chicken
Bone Conference) team choked
— losing two in a row, first to
Cal then to a pathetic Notre
Dame team on national televi-
sion.

' Who knows, maybe Pitt could
be No. 1? Oh, I forgot, it’s
February.

And when it’s February, it
marks the final chapter of the
season when teams start to gain
momentum going into the
NCAA Tournament. A

So who? Who has the fuel to
power their school straight to
the top?

Obviously, all the teams that
were No.1 have a good chance,
with the exception of Kansas,
but there are some other teams
that might take the crown.

The Big East's own UConn
has as good a shot as any.
Donyell Marshall is making a
strong campaign for Player of
the Year with his dominating
inside and out play. Pitt felt the
wrath of his skills, as has every—
one else he has run into. But the
Huskies are not just a one—man
gang. The supporting cast is not

I'u%0, -1994

so shabby either. They have the
outside shooting with Doron
Sheffer and Brian Fair, and a
solid bench. Look for UConn to
make some noise in the touma—
ment.

California has perhaps the
best 1-2 punch in the country in
Jason Kidd and Lamond Murray.
Granted, they don’t have the
depth like the other teams, but
Kidd is an X—factor type of play-
er who can change the whole
complexion of a game.

Another team who will do
some damage is Indiana. Any

Sean
Duncan

team coached by General
Robert Montgomery Knight has
a shot. Damon Bailey is finally
getting out of his expectation’s
shadow and is becoming the
player that brought Knight to an
eighth—grade game. Alan
Henderson is blossoming into a
big-time player. He is the lead-
ing rebounder in the Big Ten
and is a polished all—around
scorer.

Louisville has the best starting
five in the country. Behind the

inside play of Clifford Rozier
and the outside gunning of
Dwayne Morton, the Cardinals
can be very hard to stop. The
only thing that may hold them
back is their skimpy bench.
There are two reasons for the
emergence of the Atlantic 10
Conference in the last couple of
years — Temple and UMass.
Temple’s awesome trio of
Aaron McKie, Rick Brunson and
Eddie Jones are next to unstop-

pable, but like Louisville, their

bench hurts them.

Coach John Calipari has his
talented UMass team playing
with enthusiasm. The play of
Lou Roe and Marcus Camby
down low is often too much for
teams to handle, and when the
chips are down, they canturn to
money—man Michael \‘C’illiams
for the clutch shot.

Only time will tell who will be
the real No. 1 team when March
rolls around. Until then, the
polls will continue their chaotic
shuffling.

skills.

Then, in the mid-1980s, Ochs’
life took a complete 180-degree
turn for the better. Ochs said
that marriage at age 26 and
a newfound relationship
with God gave his life new
meaning. '

“I just didn’t have my [priori-

ties] straight earlier in my life,”

Ochs said. “llt was tough] grow-
ing up in Pittsburgh, where
hockey was not very big. How
many NHL players have come
out of Pittsburgh? None.

“I regret [not playing earlier],
but you can’t cry over spilt milk.
If I would have worked harder
at it when I was younger  if I
would have done things a little

- different  I really think I could

have gone somewhere. But
that’s in the past.

“I have to give God a lot of
credit for the change in my life.
He made me a stronger person.
I think that [religion] keeps me
happy and balanced in life. If
God"s for us, who can be
against us?”

Ochs said his trust in God
also gave him the desire and ini-
tiative to chase after the dreams
that he had let slip by him for all
those years.

File Photo

The Pitt hockey club has found success with Harold Ochs at the helm.

career began in 1984, when he
signed a minor-league contract
with the Springfield, 111. Kings
of the Continental Hockey
League.

After playing one season with
the Kings, Ochs entered the
minor-league hockey draft in
1985 and was picked up by the
Virginia Lancers of the Atlantic
Coast Hockey League.

Then, in 1987, Ochs signed
with the Johnstown Chiefs of
the East Coast Hockey League,
and enjoyed some of the most
vivid memories of his profes-
sional playing days.

In Johnstown, hockey has
become sort of an obsession.

I The 45,000 seat Johnstown War

Memorial regularly features

thousands of screaming Chiefs’
fans wearing Indian headdress.
It is generally considered the
epitome of small-town, minor-

_ league hockey.

Johnstown got this reputation
from the hockey movie Slap
5190! starring Paul Newman,
which was filmed in Johnstown.
The Chiefs’ head coach, Steve
Carlson, even starred in Slap
Shot as one of the notorious
Hanson brothers.

“That was an incredible time
in my life,” Ochs said. “Just
being there, playing in front of
thousands of people, was a
great experience.

“I am glad that I [played pro-
fessional hockey]. Most people
say ‘I would have liked to do

that,’ or ‘I think I could have
played in the minors.’ I proved
to myself that I could play (pro-
fessional) hockey.”

Now, six‘ years removed from
the long bus rides and constant
grind of minor league hockey,
Ochs passes his years of experi-
ence on to the Panthers.

His knowledge of the intrica-
cies of the game has given
Pitt the edge it needs to chal-
lenge for the WPCHA champi-
onship.

Coaching the Panthers keeps
Harold Ochs in constant contact
with the game that he loves,
and even revitalizes the memo-

ries of professional hockey that

are still rra-::<:1i iﬁ his iiiiﬁd.
Minus the headdress.
