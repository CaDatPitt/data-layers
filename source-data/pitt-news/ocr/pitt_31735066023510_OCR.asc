  ROTC Needs Officers to Fill Opened Positions 

By TERESA SOKOL

Pitt News Staff Writer
The ROTC Simultaneous Mem-
bership (SMP), is a new program

i designed to ﬁll ofﬁcer positions

currently‘ open in the Army
Reserve, according to Capt. Ed
Bradley Jr., assistant professor of
military science at Duquesne
University.

“This is avoluntary thing, one of

the many ‘options available to

ROTC cadets. Since the discon-
tinuation of the draft, there are not
enough ofﬁcers to ﬁll the positions
open in the Reserve,” he said_.

ROTC cadets choosing the.’

program can now enroll both in the
ROTC program and enlist in the
reserve programs. SMP changes
previous policy which did not allow
an individual to participate in both
programs at the same time.

SMP enrollees also draw money
from both sources by belonging to
this new program. Cadets in the
ROTC Advanced Course receive a
$100 stipend a month for each of
their last two years
program, Bradley noted.

In the reserve program, the
cadets will be called “ofﬁcer

candidates” and will receive at
least $70 per month for part time
training, such includes 16 hours

per month, with an Army Reserve

unit in the area.

“The officer candidates will not
be enlisted personnel, but under-
studies to various officers in
reserve units! It’s comparable to
training to become an executive,”
Bradley stated.

Besides the monetary benefits,
Bradley feels that this program,
which‘ will be offered to the 55
Army ROTC candidates on Pitt's
campus and to others around the
nation, offers many intangible
benefits.

“The leadership and manage-
ment skills ROTC and Reserve unit
members learn are looked for in the

civilian community. On Reserve
weekends, cadets will meet many

ofﬁcers who hold higher level ‘

executive‘ positions in the civilian
world. This -may give them the
edge in the employment world.” i

This program had not been
offered before this summer,
Bradley noted, because one could
not draw payment from the two
federal programs at the same time.

scientsits; and because we.lack the
expertisein that field, we will bring
in outside instructors and con-
sultants to keep the courses in the
humanities perspective. There will
be instructors working with this

,program from the various social

science departments. Those that
come to mind are economics,"
political science, and sociology,”
McDuft'1e said. _ .

The courses will be team-taught
by two or more members of the
Hispanic Department and by others
in the Social Sciences. As a matter
of fact, there will be an outside
faculty member from Carnegie-
Mellon University, Professor
Yvette Miller, teaching a course-in
Chicano Literature.”

initiating the funding of the courses

ment of Hispanic Languages feels

Nixon Reviewing Office Possibilities

1‘),

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—Fo_rmer Pres-
ident Richard M. Nixon is
reviewing I several possible locat-
ions in mid-town Manhattan for his
government-paid-for ofﬁce, which
he plans to move from California to
New York early next year, ofﬁcials
say. ’

Although details are not avail-
able, the cost of the office could
range from $100,000 to $280,000 a
year,,based on Nixon's request for
space and what sources say the
bids are asking in price-per-
square-foot. '

The cost for moving-the ofﬁce
furniture would be-an additional

$7,000 to $8,000 government
sources say.

Nixon notified the General
Services Administration on Oct.
12 that he would need office space
in New York City when he moves
into a $750,000 Manhattan ‘town-
house he purchased last month’.

The GSA, the government’s
landlord and supply agency,
advertised for the space in The
New York Times’ classiﬁed ads,
requesting 4,000 to 8,000 square
feet of “first-class air-conditioned
office space in Mid-Manhattan.”

GSA officials said several offers"
were received and forwarded to

Nixon, who is expected to decide
which one he wants—if any-
within about one month.

However, the officials refused to
say how much the bids were for or
where the prospective ofﬁce sites
are located. They said information
on unawarded bids was conﬁdent-
ial.

Sources, who asked not to be
identified, said the bids ranged

from about $25 to $35 per square " '

foot.

Aides to Nixon were unavailable
for comment about the new office
or its cost. Nixon is expected ‘to
move to New York in February.

About 40 Iranians invaded the

When the unarmed students

the U.S. Marine guards did not try
to repulse them and instead took to

In Tehran, Abolhassan Bani
Sadr, recently put in charge of
Iran’s Foreign Ministry by Ayatol-
lah Ruholla Khomeini, told French
radio interviewers “n‘o compro-
mise, no negotiation, is possible,”
over Iran’s demand that the United
States extradite the ousted‘ Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi to Iran to
stand trial for his life.

Bani Sadr said he would not be .

satisﬁed if the. deposed monarch,
hospitalized in New York for cancer
treatment, were merely expelled to
another country.

Even » if the shah dies in the
United States oris expelled, Iran
would still hold a trail, “because it ‘
is the Americans we want to judge
for their misdeeds.” he said.

The Iranian revolutionaries
blame the shah’s U.S. allies in part
for the’ crimes they say — he.
committed against the Iranian
people during his 37-year reign.
They contend, too, that the U.S_.

more than a “spy center” -actively

- The Tehran embassy hostages
“were arrested by the students,
not by the government,” Bani Sadr
said, although they have Kho-

Seizure Of U.S. Embassy
Sparks Demonstrations

By The Associated Press

‘ Despite pleas for calm from
President Carter and other officials
and prohibitions against parades,
the seizure of the U.S.’Embassy in
Iran sparked more demonstrations

sunday in the..United States.

In Washington, between 150 and
200 people, mostly_ young and
apparently students from capital-
area colleges, gathered in a steady,
chilly rain outside the Islamic
Center and marched near the
Iranian Embassy.

One group of protesters across
the street from the center set fire to
an Iranian flag. That brought
cheers and chats of “Down with
Khomeini” as passing motorists
honked horns in. support.

The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khom-
eini is the Moslem leader of the

Iranian revolution in which the,

Shah of Iran was deposed. Other
protesters "chanted “Deport, de-
port, deport,” apparently atrefer-
ence to Iranian. students in the
U.S., while a sign held by some
demonstrators read: “Free Ameri-
cans or Face the Consequences.”

When_the demonstrators walked
toward. the embassy, about two
blocks from the center, city Deputy

Police Chief ‘Robert . W.~ Klotzt

warned that they could not carry
picket signs, chant or stop, but
would be allowed to “walk by the
embassy like and other, American
citizen.” ’ 

Despite the warning, the mar-
chers stopped in front of the
Iranain Embassy, and police in riot
gear and mounted on motor

scooters moved on them and
hustled the crowd away.

, At least one woman demonstra- -

tor who argued with an ofﬁcer over
tactics was struck in the face by a

‘policeman.

Jordan Fox, president of the

University of A Maryland student _

association, said the demonstration
was “a student-to-student effort”
to express American student
concern for the 60 Americans being
held hostage by the Iranians.
Federal officials have prohibited
demonstrations on government
property in Washington, and the
district’s mayor, Marion Barry,
ordered city officials not to issue
parade permits to either pro-or
anti-Iranian demonstrators.» The

  No Need   '
For Violence  

As frustration in the 'United'States has grown over
the continued detention of approximately 60
Americans by Iranian students in the U.S. embassy in
Tehran, some people in this country have
senselessly attacked Iranian students here. In the
most drastic case, Americans charged an anti-shah
demonstration by Iranian students and beat and
kicked the demonstrators. At Pitt, the atmosphere
has been more subdued, with only occasional anti-
Iranian statements. However, one foreign student
was approached by two Americans in an Oakland bar
and asked whether he was from Iran. The two
continued to molest the student until he convinced
them he was not an Iranian. -

' Such violent outbursts can do nothing to win the

release of the Americans heldvhostage in Iran, and
can only serve to heighten the tensions between the
United States and Iran. If the students holding
the hostages and the government of Ayatollah
Khomeini take these attacks to be support for the
shah and rejection of thepredominate Iranian view
of the shah as a criminal‘, they might be pushed to
carry out the threat of killing the hostages—an

outcome that must be avoided.

Equally senseless are those reactions who urgean
immediate military intervention to punish the
Iranians. for their glaring breach of the rules of
diplomacy and for theinchallenge to the sovereignty

‘are nothing less than an

the shah to Tehran, Iranian students in the United
States cannot be held responsible for the holding of
hostages in the U.S. embassy, and attacks on them
infringement of

-.4 I

fundamental human rights. Military intervention _

would have a similar effect, killing innocent civilians
who would be unlucky enough to be caught between
the forces of Iran and the United States.

Jimmy Carter’s approach to the
crisi‘s—constrained statements, attempts to win
international support and diplomatic
negotiation—seems, -«at this point, the most
reasonable response to the U.S. embassy’s seizure. 15»
is the only response that could result in the eventual
release of the hostages, and Americans must help
Carter complete this goal by refraining from
outbursts of frustration that end in violence against
Iranians in the United States or in political pressure
for armed intervention.

A sobering fact that might help Americans temper ,

their anger over the actions of the actions of the
Iranian students in Tehran is that all this might not
havehappened if the United States had not been such
an adamant supporter. of the shah from the 1950s
through the 1970s, first backing his overthrow of a
democratic government, and then aiding him with

By SAMUEL SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer

Morgantown, W.Va.-That huge
sigh of relief you may have heard
around 4:30 Saturday afternoon
probably came from Mountaineer
, Field, where the Pitt Panthers
<5. managed to hold off a determined
West Virginia team, 24-17 in the
ﬁnal game ever at 55-year old

‘Mountaineer Field. _

, It iust’ may have been the most
emotional football game Pitt has
played in recent history. Just listen

.- .' to what. the respective coaches,
 .» J Jackie Sherrill and Frank Cignetti
'5 had to say about it.

“It was an exciting game,” said
Sherrill. “Maybe a bit more
exciting than I would have liked.
Playing down there for the last time
certainly gave their players a lot
more incentive.” ’

Cignetti, like the rest of the
Mountaineers,. was gracious in
defeat. “Emotion was a great part
of the game, but don’t take
anything away from our football
team,” he said. “I’m proud of

. ~ them.” ’

  

And he had good reason to be‘

pleased. Just when it appeared
Pitt might’ put the game away with
_  " leads of 17-3 ‘and 24-10, the
 A Mountaineers fought back to within

a touchdown, and set up a dramatic‘

‘last few minutes of the game.-
In the first half, Pitt clearly
showed its physical superiority, but
had trouble proving it on the
scoreboard due to offensive mis-
takes. After Jerry Boyarsky
recovered quarterback Oliver
Luck’s fumble on the first play from
scrimmage, Dan Marino returned
the. favor, muffmg a snap from
’ center.

But the Panthers weren’t.to be
shut off completely. After Randy
McMillan fumbled on the one-yard
line, Luck was intercepted by Terry
White.

The Panthers moved well on the
ground, with Artrell Hawkins
gaining 48 yards on five carries,
and Rooster Jones scored from a
yard out and Pitt led 7-0. V

Again, the defense held, and
with Marino mixing the offense
well, Mark Schubert came on to
kick a 42-yard field goal, giving Pitt
a 10-0 lead at. halftime.

  Panthers Stir: the Hicks, 24-17 *  

 

jcoaeh Jackie Sherrill and the Panther football team let out a big sigh of relief following Pitt’s 24-17‘ defeat of

West Virginia Saturday.

“There’s no question as to who

was dominating the game in the
ﬁrst half,” said Sherrill. “Mis-

takes kept us from putting ‘more ,

points on theboard. _

Marino was intercepted early in
the_ third quarter,. giving West
Virginia excellent field position.
But the‘ Pitt defense; which held
WVU to 12 yards rushing in the
first half, thwarted the ground
effort once agin, and WVU had to
settle for a 22-yard field goal by
Steve Sinclair.

When Pitt came back and made
it 17-3 on an eight-yard pass from
Marino to Benjie Pryor, the game

seemed to be over, considering
Pitt’s defensive performance up to
that point.

“I know we couldn’t get much of
a running game going out there
today,” said Cignetti. “I’d have to
look at the ﬁlms to see why, but-it

seems they gave us a pretty good '

whipping, /physically, up front."

“When you have a defense like Pitt 4

has, you canrtry a lot of differen
things,” he added. '
But West Virginia seemed to do
a few things of their own.
offense began to move, led by
Luck, the sophomore from Cleve-
land who is an excellent scrambler

and passer; especially on the run.

He eluded Pitt linemen time after
time, and ran for several‘ first
downs. He completed only 12 of 30
passes, but managed to hit
important tosses to the tight’ end,
Mark Raugh, and’split ends Darrell
Miller‘, and Cedric Thomas. The
latter caught a 19-yard scoring
strike from Luck to make the score
17-10. He got the pass off just as
Pitt end Ricky Jackson delivered a
crunching hit‘.

Pitt countered with a four-yard
touchdown run by Fred Jacobs, and
once again, Pitt looked safe.“-.

But after Reggie McLee returned

the ensuing kickoff to the WVU 40,
and Pitt got called for a pass
interference penalty, the Mount-
aineers_were knocking on the door.

A pass to Raugh put the ball on the -

Pitt one, from where Luckkept on
the quarterback snead to make it
24-17. I

Pitt took over on its own 20, and
on third and two from the 28,
Marino hit Benjie«Pryor for a huge
gain o.ut to the 43, giving the
Panthers some field position
breathing room. Marino, still cool
and calm, found secondary receiver
Ralph Still at the WVU 28, where
Still made a great leaping catch
along the sidelines.

But just to make things even
more dramatic, Jacobs fumbled the

ball over at the 20. From there, on, _
~ fourth and 16, Luck was’ inter-

cepted by Jeff Pelusi, who decided
to’ show off his running‘ ability for
several yards, until he was hit and
fumbled the ball back to West
Virginia at the 22, making it an
automatic first down, because

"there had been ’ a change of
V possession.

Not to be outdone, Luck threw
another interception, this one to
JoJo'Heath, (Heath-’s second of the
afternoon) and Marina sat on the

V’ » ball for the final two plays, and Pitt .
, made the nostalgic afternoon even

a bit‘ sadder. ._ 1 .

situation looked grim. Sure, they were holding onto
a 17-10 lead against a gutsy West Virgi.nia,team—-but
the Mountaineers. had just scored and recovered a
fumble on the following Pitt drive. Behind the
/urgings of the vociferous Hoopie fans and the ﬁred-
up play of the WVU team, everything was set for a

‘ glorious come-from-behind victory on the last day of

1 Mountaineer Field football.
It had been billed as an emotional last game at

I Mountaineer Field and so it was a fitting farewell to

the grand old stadium. The standing room crowd,

perfect game, but what it did see was a hard-hitting
game filled with a lot of great plays. ;

But as usual, it was the play of the Panther defense
that allowed Pitt to escape Morgantown victorious.
There were so many key plays in the game, but if one

V had to spotlight one aspect of the defense that

shone, it would be the secondary. Terry White, the
star of last week’s victory against Syracuse, was
extremely evident with his ferocious tackling and an
‘ interception. ‘

White, after some early season troubles, has begun

to play with much more confidence and is asserting

himself 1 as one of the key figures in that tough
Panther defense. White talked about the game
afterwards, “The crowd noise pumped us up so
much that we were ready for them. I think I've
finally adjusted to playing cornerback and I feel very
confident. We knew we were in for a tough game
and we were well prepared. ”

Another member of the secondary that played well
was Jo] 0 Heath. Health, who had been touted as all-
America in pre-season but had not performed up to
expectations due to injuries, picked off two passes
including one late in the game that led to the
clinching score. Heath seemed excited by the
performance of the secondary and gave credits to all
his teammates.

“Terry White has really come along as a player
and this has strengthened our team. Lynn (Thomas)
and Carlton (Williamson) have both played steady
ball and we feel confident that we can play with
anybody. The crowd pumped us up and I think we

The offense once again put on a terrific display of
movement inside the twenties, but made a lot of
mistakes. Bob Gruber, starting left tackle,’ talked

about this but did not have a reason for the mistakes, ,

“I really don’t know why we make so many
mistakes, but I do know that we have to cut them
out. We can still improve our running game and we
definitely have to eliminate turnovers. ”

“But I do feel we are of top ten material and we're
just as good as a lot of teams. It was an exciting
game and that was due to'the turnovers, but it was
great due to all the fan support and that really got us
going,” said Gruber.

It was an important win "for the Panthers, who
proved they could win under tremendous crowd
pressure. It was also another game in the learning
process for Dan Marino, who still has a long way to

'go, but is showing signs of greatness. For the Pitt

defense it was business as usual and once again it
proved itself to be sound.

With the combination of great defense and
adequate offense, the Panthers made sure the last
day of Mountaineer Field was not a happy occasion
in Morgantown. '

A‘ the ﬁrst runners

After onelong year of waiting for
another shot at qualifying for the
NCAA cross-country _champion-
ships, Gary Siriano made the most
of Saturday’s qualifying meet at
Lehigh by placing 11th in a field of
over 300.

Siriano, who missed qualifying
for the NCAA meet by one place in
1978, was ’ third out of six
individuals who will advance to the
championships meet, to be held
next Monday at Lehigh. Eight of
in the race
qualified with their teams and
therefore were not counted in the
scramble for individual qualifying
spots.

The Pitt senior’s time of 31:16
was his best ever for a 10 kilometer

(6.2 'miles) cross-country course
and his high finish was a little
surprising to not only some of the
better-known runners he defeated,
but to Siriano himself. '

“I got to the four-mile mark,” he
said, “and I was up there around
14th place thinking, “What am I
doing so close to the lead?”

“I was in front of so many really
good runners, I thought it wouldn't
last,” Siriano said.

It did, and so Siriano becomes
the rﬁrst Panther athlete to
represent his team at the NCAA
cross-country meet since Mel Boyd
and Dave McDonald in 1977.

Despite his best run ever,
according to Siriano, it was
probably, the worst heever felt in
preparation for a run: “I didn’t

think I would do well,” he said. “I
just felt weak‘, kind of nauseaus.
Maybe it was just the importance of
the meet that got to me.” -
Penn State won the team title
with 75 points. Next in the team
competition was Villanova (107),
Manhatten (108), Farleigh Dicken-
son (131) and Bucknell (136).
Villanova star Sydney Maree was
first. across the line in 30:05,

followed by Marty Ludwikowski of
Manhatten and Solemon Chebor of 
Farleigh Dickenson. Pitt’s Randy 2

Bailey placed l10th.

Except for" Siriano, the ‘cross-
country runners will join the rest of
the Panther tracksters in prepara-
tion for an indoor meet at Bucknell
on Dec. 1.

RALEIGH, N.C.—Penn State
placekicker Herb Menhardt’ saved
his best for last to lead the Nittany
Lions to their sixth win-a 9-7

“Herb is a confident kid, and I

walked onto the ﬁeld,” said Coach
Joe Paterno. “But in the 30 years
I’ve been coaching, it was the

The Wolfpack had just edged out
a 7-6 lead when Scott Smith led his

The Pitt women's volleyball team

— was dealt one of their worst losses

of the season Friday as Penn State
defeated the Pantherettes, 15-5,
15-7, 15-4. -
“We just got clobbered,” said
head coach Mike Hebert. “I lost
count of all the mistakes we made.
We didn’t play well at all.”
. The Pantherettes will be seeded

‘. ﬁrst‘ when the Eastern Regional

2119.79 A

Championships are held here
beginning Thursday, while Penn
State is seeded fourth.

“Penn State played a .perfect
match and if they play like that this
weekend, they'll win the region-

. als,”. said Hebert. “If we playﬂlike

we did, we won’t win anything.”

Hebert said he has no explan- .

ation for the inconsistency of the

Pantherettes’ play this season.‘
“The players really work hard in

said. “It’s nothing we’re doing

wrong and we’re certainly not
panicking about it.”

Hebert was quick to add that the
entire team didn’t play poorly and
he singled out two freshmen for
their ﬁne play.

“Julie Gaul and Ellen Mangus
played a really good match,” he
said. “In all aspects of the game,
those two did a ﬁne job.”

In preparing for this weekend’s ~

regionals, Hebert said’ the team

won’t be doing anything different. ~

’ “We're not afraid to play

a lot tougher ,.teams than Penn

The regionals begin on Thursday

changed this season in that only

participating. Seeded behind Pitt
are Rutgers, Maryland, Penn

According to the coach, there is

no one (area in which the
Pantherettes are weak, except in
moments of inconsistency. And in
those moments, he said, Pitt is
weak in all areas. ——~

‘ ‘Our passing has been strong all

year," said « Hebert, “with a
passing percentage of between 65
and 70 percent.”

He continued, saying that Pitt's
blocking average and the team will
work on that during the week;
particularly the outside blocking.

“Our hitting, or attacking, is the
strongest part of our game,” the
coach added. “While our serving

is deﬁnitely the weakest part.” '

Concerning the team’s setting;

one of the most important aspects
of the sport, Hebert said, “At
times our setting has been very
good and at times it’s been just
