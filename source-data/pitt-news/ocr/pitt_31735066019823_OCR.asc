Pittsburgh
mourns  
mayor’s
death

By Marc Duchin
Editor in Chief

Hundreds of people, including
governors, senators, congressmen
and city officials, gathered at St.
Paul's Cathedral yesterday to
honor the late mayor of Pitts-

 burgh, Richard S. Caliguiri.

”His love for the people of
Pittsburgh was eternal,” said
Greensburg Bishop Anthony G.
Bosco in his eulogy of Mayor
Caliguri. ”With Dick Caliguiri,
the words which came to me im-
mediately were strong and
gentle.”

Among those attending the
funeral were Governor Casey,
Philadelphia Mayor Wilson
Goode, Steeler chairman Art
Rooney and Pitt President,Wes—
ley Posvar. v

”Mayor Caliguiri was a very
good mayor at a very critical
time," said Dr. Posvar. ”He was
very sympathetic toward our
[Pitt's] economic goals.”

Dr. Posvar said that though
Mayor Caliguiri did not directly
influence Pitt administration, ”he
brought everyone together.

Over a thousand people attended the funeral of Mayor Caliguiri in St. Paul Cathedral yesterday.

”He was a man of personal

charm, modesty, sensitivity and’

great courage," Dr. Posvar said.

There is a feeling of anxiety
and anticipation in the mind of
at least one law professor at
the University of Pittsburgh.

John E.AMurray, Jr., a former
law school dean at both Pitt
and Duquesne, was recently
named as Duquesne Universi-
ty’s first lay president.

Commenting on his goals at
Duquesne, Murray said, ‘'1
think, in general, the same
plans that any president would
have in the sense of academic
excellence. Duquesne has
some very strong areas aca-
demically, some very strong
teachers and some fine scho-
lars. I think any president
would want to enhance that
academic reputation."

Murray recognizes Du-
quesne as ”a combination of
academic excellence, and a
spiritual tradition and a focus
on values." 1

He maintains that these fac-

Pitt law professor
ready for Duquesne

tors at Duquesne have been
enmeshed for many years, and
that he will do his best to con-
tinue this as well as enhance it.

The fact that he is the first
layman president in Du-
quesne’s 110-year history
doesn't bother Murray. Con-
sidering that being a priest was
not a requirement, Murray
said he feels comfortable with
the position.

The feeling at Pitt, however,
is that while Duquesne is gain-
ing a president, Pitt is losing a
respected professor.

Pitt President Wesley Posvar
lauded Murray as ”a great
citizen of the University of
Pittsburgh, and the epitome of
the best of faculty. He is a
great teacher and a great scho-
lar. His reputation. among
former law students is almost
legend, and of course we'll
miss him.”

”At the same time,” Posvar
said, ‘'1 am utterly enthusias-

tic about his appointment at

dress uniforms. Caliguiri’s wife,
Jeanne, entered the Cathedral
with sons Gregg, 18, and David,
15, on each side. The mayor's
casket was brought into the
Cathedral at 10:35 a.m.

The service was televised on

KDKA, WTAE, and WPXI and the
Cathedral remained filled for the
length of the service, which end-
ed at 1:00 p.m.

”The service was very fullfill-
ing,” said Dr. Posvar.

Others attending the funeral

were senators Heinz, Spector and
Jubelirer, Erie mayor Louis J. Tul-
lio, and Mayor Sophie Masloff,
Caliguiri’s successor.

”She [Masloff] is a fine person
with great integrity,” said Dr.

Waterski club still without boat

By Mindy Boffemmyer

Assistant News Editor

With waterski season fast ap-
proaching, the Pitt Waterski Club
may find itself up the river
without a boat.

in January, the Waterski Club
submitted a request to the Stu-
dent Government Board for allo-
cations of $7569 to cover the
costs of maintaining a boat over
a two—year period.

According to Waterski Club
Presidentjohn Huber, the money
requested would cover 60 per-
cent of the costs involved in leas-
ing, insuring, docking and winter
storage of a boat for the club's
use.

Huber said that once the club's
budget was approved by the SGB
allocations committee, lawyers
from a boat leasing company
drafted a lease for the club. But
the budget still had to be brought
before the entire SGB for ap-
proval.

At a ‘meeting to discuss the
Waterski Club budget, the SGB
took a vote to approve funding
for the first year with the stipula-
tion that the club could only ask

for 75 percent of this amount the
following year. The vote was ta-
bled with four of the members
voting in favor of the proposal,
two against it and two members
absent, according to Huber.

SGB President Craig Jackson
said that the Board tabled the
vote to get more information.

”At a later meeting [of the
SGB], they weren't going to ad-
dress the Waterski Club,” Huber
said. ”But I asked ‘when, if ever,
are you going to address this?’
and they decided to vote then.

”The vote was a four to four
deadlock, so Craig Jackson
passed the gavel and voted
against it,” Huber said. '

”The Board just didn't feel that
there was a need for that much
money,” said Jackson. "They got
three or four thousand dollars last
year as a start—up for equipment.”

The allocations committee then
met to rewrite the budget so that
the new proposal could be vot-
ed on by the entire Board. Huber
said that the SGB told him he
would be contacted for this meet-
ing but said that he wasn't
notified. J

The allocations committee pro-

posed a budget of approximate-
ly $3,000 for the Waterski Club
and this proposal was passed by
the SGB.

”That was fine but it didn't get
us a boat. We had to have the
money for the boat by June 1,”
Huber Said-

Jackson said that in order to‘

fund the organization, the Water-
ski Club might consider raising its
membership fee or fund raising.

Huber then organized a meet-
ing with Terrence Milani and
Joyce Giangarlo of the Office of
Student Activities, Joseph Caval-
la of the Office for Student Affairs
and members of the SGB to fur-
ther discuss the budget.

After this meeting, the SGB
decided to review the Waterski
Club's initial budget request.
Another vote was taken but none
of the Board members changed
his or her vote. Since Jackson
decided not to vote, the budget
stood at $3,000. .

”We’ve only been here for a
year and we're going to have to
fold, not because we don't have
enough people interested, but be-
cause the Board won't give us
enough money,” Huber said.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, May II, 1988

   

Mob boss Scarfo acquitted of 1984 slaying

  PHILADELPHIA — Reputed mob

boss Nicodemo ”Little Nicky"
Scarfo grinned with glee Tuesday
and raised his hand in a victory

’ salute after a jury acquitted him

and eight associates of the 1984
slaying of mob rival Salvatore
Testa.

”Not guilty,” forewoman Ollie
Minze intoned 27 times to the
charges of murder, conspiracy
and possession of an instrument

of crime - three for each defen-

dant —— and friends and relatives
in the crowded City Hall cour-
troom cheered, and wept and ap-

-plauded.

”I love the American judicial
system,” Scarfo’s son, Nicodemo
Jr., said after the jury verdict, a
day after arguments ended in the
eighth week of the trial.

He had been in court every
day, with other relatives, giving
visible support to his jailed father,
an Atlantic City, N.J., cement

 contractor said by authorities to

head the Philadelphia-southern
New Jersey mob. The regional
crime family has been decimated
in the past decade by bloody in-
ternal warfare, arrests and con-

victions.

The 59-year-old Scarfo, nattily
attired in a navy gabardine suit,
has been in prison since his arrest
in January 1987 for conspiring to
extort $1 million from a Philadel-
phia developer, and now is serv-
ing a 15-year sentence for that
crime.

The acquittal was the second
court victory in six months for
Scarfo, who was cleared in De-
cember on drug charges.

Stunned by the verdict, Assis-
tant District Attorney Barbara
Christie asked that the jury be
polled. The eight women and
four men, asked on each count
whether their decision was ”not
guilty,” responded loudly in uni-
son, ”Yes.”

Ms. Christie had described
Scarfo as ”an organized-crime ex-
ecutioner” who marked mob
members for immediate death
when they questioned his
authority.

She had demanded that the
jury ”pin on these defendants the
labels that in justice and in law
they do richly deserve — mur-
derers," but the jury refused af-

NEWS BRIEFS

ter deliberating less than five
hours.

The courtroom broke into
cheers and applause again, and
the defendants embraced their
lawyers and then waved happily
to the jury as Common Pleas
Judge Albert Sabo called for
order. 1

When quiet was restored the
judge told the jurors they had
”performed a very important
function in the administration of
justice.”

Pope begins five day
tour of South America

LA PAZ, Bolivia — Pope John
Paul II began a tour of South
America's poorest country Mon-
day with an appeal to its people
”not to lose hope.”

”I will spend five days among
you, sharing your aspirations,
seeing first-hand this nation
stricken by poverty and a lack of
development and resources,” he

said in an arrival speech at the La
Paz airport, which is 13,150 feet
above sea level and ringed by
snow-capped Andean peaks.

President Victor Paz Estenssoro
said in a welcoming speech that
the visit would help bolster the
flagging spirits of Bolivians.

From the airport, the papal
caravan descended to La Paz,
which is 11,930 feet above the
sea in a mountain ravine.

The vehicles moved down a
cliffside highway that was lined
with tens of thousands of people.
Crowds cheered and waved ban-
ners of yellow and white, the
Vatican colors, and the yellow,
red and green Bolivian flag.

The pope, standing in the glass
booth of the popemobile,
traveled 11 miles through the city
center to the papal nuncio’s resi-
dence, where he is staying.

Reagan denounces
Regan’s tell-all book

WASHINGTON -— President
Reagan was quoted Monday as
telling a luncheon guest that
Donald T. Regan’s tell-all book
was ”a bunch of falsehoods" and
the White House denounced it as
a ”breach of confidence.”

Syndicated columnist Carl Ro-
wan, who had lunch with Reagan
on Monday, quoted the president
as calling the book by his former
chief of staff ”a bunch of false-
hoods” and saying, ”’I’|I be
damned if I'll just stand by and let
them railroad my wife.’”

Rowan said the president told .

him a three-month period of ac-
tivity following his July 1985 col-
on cancer surgery ”had nothing
to with astrology," as maintained
in the book.

Murray said of the past

entire community... that those

There is absolutely no point in

New fraternity considers colo

By Scot Ross

Assistant News Editor

Within the Greek community,
steps are currently under way to
bring a new chapter into the Pitt
fraternity system.

According to IFC president
Chuck Farinella, Phi Sigma Kap-
pa has contacted Assistant Direc-
tor of Student Activities Bridget
Guernsey and the IFC with the
hope of establishing a chartered
colony at Pitt.

”A chapter may be invited to
colonize [at Pitt] if it obtains a
simple majority vote of IFC,’’

Farinella said.

He explained that after cor-
responding with Tim Vojtasko,
Director of Expansion at the Phi
Sigma Kappa national office in In-
diana, that if accepted at Pittgthe
new fraternity will seek members
following the regularly scheduled
Pitt Greek rush.

”They will not compete with
the other fraternities during rush.
They are looking for people who
want to start a fraternity,” stated
Farinella.

Vojtasko commented that
being a previous resident of Pitts-
burgh gave him the idea to start

a Pitt chapter. ”Right now, we're
are exploring the possibilities,"
he said.

Farinella expressed optimism

toward a Phi Sigma Kappa chap-
ter at Pitt. So far, he has contact-
ed four fraternity presidents and
stated that he did not foresee a
problem.
» He added that the destiny of
Phi Sigma Kappa will rest with
the vote of the IFC at the Sept. 6
meeting.

Farinella said, ’’I’m in favor of
it. Although I am only one per-
son, I support the addition of Phi
Sigma Kappa.

City police and paramedics wore black ribbons across their

Posvar.

Dr. Posvar also said that he
could see no reason for Mayor
Masloff to change any of
Caliguiri’s policies.

Mayor Caliguiri was elected
Council president in 1977 and
became mayor in April of that
year, replacing Pete Flaherty,
who was appointed U.S. deputy
attorney general for the Carter
Administration.

Caliguiri’s most praised poli-
cies included the Renaissance 2
project, in which he oversaw the
construction of new downtown
buildings, reorganization of the
city's public safety services and

the intiation ‘of’ a ‘public-private ’

partnership for the Pirates base-
ball team which raised $45 mil-
lion and enabled the Pirates to
remain in Pittsburgh.

Dr. Posvar spoke highly of
Caliguiri’s Strategy 21 project in-
volving joint city-county support
for area development projects
receiving state funding, including
Pitt's technological center and the
midfield terminal.

Fourteen months ago, Mayor
Caliguiri was diagnosed with
amyloidosis, a rare disease in
which protein fibers interfere
with internal organs. In Decem-
ber of 1987, doctors implanted a
pacemaker to regulate his heart-
beat and in the following months,

Lisa Berry and her niece, Catherine Harkins, were part of the many Pittsburghers
that mourned the death of Mayor Caliguiri. The two were part of a prayer vigil in Beechview.

Mourners from the entire city and beyond paid their respects to Mayor Caliguiri as his casket
was displayed in the rotunda of the City-County Building on Monday. 1

Getting her act together hurts

The other day, my aunt and I
had a bit of a falling out. She was
under a lot of stress taking law
school finals, and I have been los-
ing my mind trying to move into
a new apartment. I wasn't think-
ing straight because I had so
much on my mind.

I gave her the wrong address of
my new place and she wasted
time that she really didn't have

stress delirium. I was laughing at
the ridiculousness of the concept
”get your act together,” and the
fact that intelligent people use
this expression. I decided that
there is only so much that can be

much at once. And what good is
it to tell a person to get his or her
act together? When someone has
a lot hanging over her head, the
last thing she needs is to be
reminded that it's there.

I decided that day that I've
been striving for years to get my
act together and I'll decide for
myself just how to go about do-
ing so. At this point, when I was

Okay, Soitwag funny_Aﬁera||, ridicule. The motto of this ad— sy in the Reagan constellation. any quackery, from the benefits ﬁq

few of us had associated the Age
of Aquarius with the Reagan
Ascendancy. We thought of Ron
as more old values than New
Age, more Stars and Stripes than
Stars and Planets.

We worried about the in-
fluence of Elliot Abrams, not
Mars; about Jesse Helms, not
Jupiter. Sure, the guy came from
Hollywood, where people ask
you your sign the way they ask
you your profession in the east.

But that was history, like his un-.

ion work.

So when the news about astrol-
ogy in the White House came
out, it was played for the chuck-
les. Voodoo economics and lunar
foreign policy. I looked at Linda
(no relation) Goodman's "Love
Signs” to find out why Don Re-
gan the Archer would tell on
Nancy Reagan the Cancer. It
turns out that they were always
as different as Day (Nancy) and

P ‘night (Don).

As usual, the president and his
inner circle managed to laugh
with us, having learned that
there's nothing like a self-

deprecating ‘chuckle to turnaway“ ‘

ministration has been ”Just kid-
ding, folks.'’ I could see Nancy
Reagan polishing up her act for
the next Gridiron Club musical.

But at some point in the hilari-
ty, MacNiel/Lehrer Newshour did
one of those earnestly evenhand-
ed debates about astrology, and
I lost it. My humor, that is. There
was Jeremy Stone, president of
the American Federation of
Scientists, facing off Darrell Mar-
tinie, the astrologist known fond-
ly in these parts as the Cosmic
Muffin.

As far as I'm concerned, getting
your horoscope read is on par
with getting your colors done.
(I'm an Aries and an Autumn.) It's
like reading your personality pro-
file on the placemat chart in a
Chinese restaurant. But a serious
debate on the validity of astrolo-
gy? A serious believer in the
White House? Two of them?
Give me a break.

What stifled my laughter is that
the image fit. Reagan has always
exhibited a fey indifference
toward science. Facts, like num-
bers, roll off his back. And we've

This time, it was star-gazing.

that became a serious issue for
the sober "MacNeil/Lehrer." Not
that long ago, it was Reagan's
support of creationism that resur-
rected a more prolonged and dis-
ruptive debate. Creationists
actually got equal time with
evolutionists. The public was
supposed to be open-minded to
the claims of paleontologists and
fundamentalists, as if the two
were scientific colleagues.
Before that, it was "Star Wars,"
the most costly "science" fanta-

The president just plain old be-
lieved in an impenetrable shield
around the United States. While
a galaxy of scientists protested, he
clapped for this Tinkerbell and
we paid $12 billion.

It's been clear for a long time
that the president is adverse to
science. He treats the scientific
method as one of a range of in-
teresting tools for problem-
solving, just a notch or two be-
low intuition. (Where is Bill Ben-
nett when we need him?)

In general, these attitudes fall
onto friendly American turf, be-
cause most of us today share not
only a touch of superstition but
a bushel of scientific skepticism.
We've seen "facts" come and go.
We've seen the evidence and the
experts shift. Few of us bow be-
fore experts or footnote every
idea with comedian Elaine May's
old line: "And that man's a
doctor!"

But at the outer edges, this
skepticism about science turns
into a kind of naive acceptance
of non-science, or even non-
sense. The same people who
doubt experts can alsobelieve

of laetrile to the eye of the newt
to the movement of planets. We
lose the capacity to discriminate,
to make rational — scientific —
judgements. It's all about the
same.

No, I don't think the Chief
Aquarian made crucial world de-
cisions by a celestial calculation
that's as accurate as the measure-
ment of the flat earth. But this as-
trological news is in keeping with
his fuzzy approach to science.
On a pop quiz, would he really
know the difference between
physics and metaphysics?

How much worse, you ask,
could the last seven'years have
been if there had been an as-
trologer in the cabinet? Would
the wisdom of the zodiac have
been less valid than the wisdom
of Oliver North? Well, I will al-
low a small chuckle. But for the
next eight moons, cross your
fingers, don't step on any cracks
and wish upon a star.

Sandoz,

By Stephen Gebeloff

For The Pitt News

/oin the Crowdis the first album
to be released by the group San-
doz. The band is comprised of
professionals who enjoy making
music together. Centered in Pitts-
burgh, they generally play in the
Oakland/Wilkinsburg area.

Sandoz features Mark Brown-
ing, a employee of the Pittsburgh
Aviary, on harmonica and acous-
tic guitar. Providing the bottom
for the band is Steve ”Punk" Cun-
ningham on bass. Cunningham
spends his work time dabbling in
biology.

David Dorwart is a pharmacist
who dresses up as the lead
guitarist for the band. Keeping
them all out of jail is Bill Maru-
ca, a lawyer, on keyboards.
Rounding out Sandoz is Mark
Weakland; he makes music a
major and not just a hobby.

Their latest release contains
nine original songs that reflect the
spirit of their live performances,
hence the title. In order to capture
the energy of a live performance
on the album, Sandoz used a
recording of their fans from one
of their live performances and
mixed it into Maruca’s ripping
guitar lead to give the listener the
effect of being in front of the stage
at a Sandoz show.

Bass player Cunningham's
"Soon You'll be Mine” follows
with its reggae feel and good vo-
cal harmonies that create nice
change from the upbeat rock tem-
po of ”Come and Join the
Crowd.” Next is Browning's
”Back on the Right Track.”

R & B changes as well as his own

soulful harmonica work. Wrap-
ping up the first side of the album
is a Grateful Dead-inspired
”Ec|ipse."

The production of the album
shines on this cut. Guitar over-
dubbing along with Maruca’s
keyboards and organ work create
a powerful, driving song from
start to finish.

Side two of the album offers a

variety of styles. The diversity of
the entire album is due the alter-

, nation of lead vocals (four of the

five members sing lead at some
point) and the sharing of song-
writing. In addition, Sandoz used
two local artists to add saxo-
phone and fiddle, which compli-
ment the songs nicely. In all this
is a well put together album

Sandoz’s live performance is
an experience not to be missed.
In addition to their original
material, Sandoz has over 200
cover songs in its repertoire.
Covers include songs from The
Band, Little Feat, The Grateful
Dead, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison
and Warren Zevon, just to name
a few.

Wednesday, May ll, I988

Unlike many bands today that
will always play the same show,
Sandoz plays a different show
each time out. This diversity is
due in part to the large song list
and Sandoz’s ability to improvise.
Once a song has begun, the mu-
sicians keep their ears open, mak-

Catching onto the
Rhythm and Wretches

By Lee Sharra
Staff Writer

There is almost always some-
thing happening in Oakland's
growing music scene every Fri-
day and Saturday night. Last Fri-
day was no exception. Two of the
area's best bands, Johnny Rhythm
& the Dimestore 45s and the Lit-
tle Wretches, played the Electric
Banana that night. Both bands
performed throbbing sets that left
me babbling incoherently for
several days afterward.

I've seen the Wretches about
12 times and they are still one of
my favorite bands. Putting that
bias aside, the Wretches still
managed to impress the hell out
of me with new arrangements of
many of their old songs. Whether
it was the sum total of their more
than six years of playing together
or their recent studio experience
of recording 16 new songs for a
new album, the Wretches were
tighter than I have ever seen them
before.

They opened their set with a
funked-up version of ”Born with
a Gift" with a new middle eight
that added more of a bluesy feel.
Their new bass player added a

nice fat underbelly for the rest of
the band to work over, adding
something that the recorded ver-
sion of "Gift" lacks. Their revved
version of ”Dirt" really kicked as
well. Guitarist Bob Wagner and
violinist Chuck Wagner inter-
wove melodic leads and harmon-
ic riffs that created a more
organized, thought—out sound.

They played most of the songs
that their fans have come to love,
including "Pleasure Seeker" and
”One Heartbeat Away." The
Wretches also did a tremendous
version of Patty Smith's ”Because
the Night." Other covers were
The Who's "Substitute” and the
Animals’ ”We Gotta Get Out Of
This Place.” Their new bass play-
er really got off doing his best
John Entwistle impersonation on
"Substitute."

I spoke with Bob Wagner after
the set and he mentioned that the
Wretches had just completed
filming their video for ”Born with
a Gift.” Filmed at Trees Hall, the
Wretches star as a band perform-
ing at a high school prom. It
seems a little far fetched, but Bob
said that he saw a rough cut of the
video and that it looks better than

The songs flow nicely and keep
the audience on its feet, with
most of the audience dancing the
entire night.

”The enthusiasm of our fans is
a real turn on for us. We try and
capture the energy of our fans
and put it right back into the mus-
ic,” said Mark Browning. ”The
most important thing we try and
do is make the show fun and ex-

citing for our audience,” Brown-
ing added.

Sandoz’s next show is on May
28 at 10:00 p.m. at the Elk’s Club
7750 Penn Ave. in Wilkinsburg,
so come and Join the Crowd.

even he had expected.

Johnny Rhythm and the Dime-
store 455 came on next and
played a loose set. This was prob-
ably due to the fact that they're
involved in the hectic process of
recording demos for the album
contract they won at the Tri-State
Rock Competition.

Johnny Rhythm is currently be-

like Elvis Presley's (and every-

Their music sounds like a cross
between late '50s bubble gum
pop and early Who/ early Clash
three-chord melodic rock. Ed
played a mean rhythm guitar and
sang all of the songs. He also
played slide guitar and debuted
his brand new harmonica on
”Prince Charming.”

Lead guitarist Long Tall Slim
sang back-up vocals and inter-
wove melodic fills throughout the
set. Bassist Dave kept things
steady while doing some interest-

ing Mike Mills-style runs.

They played all their big WPTS
hits,including ”Fallin’ On Back In
Love,” ”She’s Just A Girl” and
their first single, their jibe at
mainstream commercial ra-
-dio,”Radio Americana.” They
also played their ”First Waltz,” a
3/4 time send up of love songs.

Ed Masley writes all of their Q

material and inserts his quirky wit
throughout. He creates bizarre
characters like the gun-happy
twistoid in ”Take You Away.” As
testament to this, he told me that
he had just completed a song
called ”Why does everything
sound like David Byrne.”

Johnny Rhythm will be playing
the Banana again on May 20, but
if you can't wait, you can see him
this Thursday at the Graffiti em-
ceeing the Pleasure Headsl Herit-

End of spring drills poses questions for fall

By Kirk Swauger

For The Pitt News

To some collegiate football

J ,goaches, spring practice is a non-
‘eventful requirement, a time to
keep the players’ minds on the
game, a time to occupy when
there is precious little else to do.
To Pitt head coach Mike Gott-
fried, however, it was a necessity.
Gottfried realized at the begin-
ning of spring drills in late March

that there were more questions
than possible answers. His
responsibility was to discern
some of the possible solutions -
not all of them.

In that regard, Pitt's spring was
successful.

"I think spring practice is im-
portant,” Gottfried explained two
days after its conclusion. "You
get twenty days to improve

without the pressure of a

ballgame."

Former Pitt receiver
~ Da wkins shining with
I ArenabaIl’s Gladiators

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

When wide receiver Julius
Dawkins left the University of
Pittsburgh after the 1982 season,
he left a definite mark on the
school.

Now, five years later, he's ‘nav-
ing an impact on Pittsburgh foot-
ball once again.

Dawkins, 27, is in his first sea-
son of Arena Football, playing
defensive back and wide receiver
for the Pittsburgh Gladiators (2-0),
who are tied with the Chicago
Bruisers for first place.

Dawkins has been off to a fast
start, catching 10 passes for 145
yards and four touchdowns in the
first two games of the season. He
also has three tackles, a pass
deflection and a fumble recovery
to his credit.

In the April 28 season opener
at Detroit, Dawkins was named
Little Caesar's "Ironman" winner,
an award given to the best two-
way player in the game.

Although this is a new sport for
Dawkins, he's taken a real liking
toward it. "It’s exciting. I love it.
It's the most exciting game I've
ever played,” said Dawkins. "It
is football, only this type makes
it more interesting.”

The way Dawkins has per-
formed this season, he hasn't
missed a beat from college.
Dawkins played for the Panthers
from 1979-82 and still holds two

Pitt receiving records: most
touchdowns in a game (four) and
in a season (16). ,

Dawkins is fourth on the all-
time Panther receiving list with
1,457 yards and 10th on the scor-
ing with 138 points (23 touch-
downs) and led the team in
receptions for the 1981 season
(46). He was a member of the
1982 Senior and Hula Bowl
teams.

He was also named to Kodak's
Second Team, UPI and AP All-
America first team and Playboy
Second Team All-American.

Dawkins was drafted by the
Buffalo Bills on the 12th round of
the 1983 draft and stayed with
the team before he voluntarily left
prior to the 1985 season.

"I had a bad camp in 1985 and
there was a lot of competition,”
said Dawkins. "I was making a
lot of mental errors, so I made the
choice easy for them.”

Dawkins was taken by the
Gladiators as a territorial pick and
made the team. But it wasn't an
easy transition.

"You have to do a lot more
conditioning, that's for sure,” said
Dawkins. "In the NFL, you
played one position, so you're
not on the field all the time. You
were good ‘there’, you special-
ized in one position.

"Going both ways, you're
constantly on the move‘. It's pret-
ty hectic," he added.

Please see Dawkins, page 10

He learned this about his 1988
team:

What were supposedly defen-

sive weaknesses — the secon-
dary, linebackers and depth on
the line — should not be reason
for concern. What were suppos-
edly offensive problems still
could be.

"Defensively, we answered all
the questions. We know what we
have," Gottfried said. "Offensive-
ly we have a lot of work ahead

of us. There are decisions that
have to be made."

Here are some answers, ac-
cording to Gottfried:

0 Strong safety Louis Riddick
and cornerbacks Cornell Hollo-
way and Alonzo Hampton
proved themselves capable of
stepping into the secondary for
three graduated National Football
League draft choices — Quintin
Jones, Gary Richard, and Billy
Owens.

0 Sophomore Jeff Christy is
maturing into the solid player
people expect him to be, and
Prentiss Wright — after a season
at fullback and a brief look in the
secondary —— may have found a
home at weakside linebacker.

0 Freshman Richard Allen will
replace Tony Siragusa, who had
surgery on his right knee, at
defensive tackle.

0 Dan Crossman is a suprising-

ing represented this year.
"Over the last three or four

years, the meet has gotten better_

and better in the type of perfor-
mance we've been getting,” Vas-
vary said. "It's been a meet where
people have, in fact, run very
fast."

The Pitt Invitational will begin

at} R-U1-.90 Satucdax at Pitt §Ia<ii: .3 .

Walker and Brian Davis are a
couple of elusive, breakaway
tailbacks.

Here are some questions:

0 With Darnell Dickerson
missing spring practice because
of a thigh injury and with Larry
Wanke winning the John Michel-
son Award as the most valuable
back in the spring, who will be

"the quarterback?

0 Will Pitt's running game be
able to compensate for the depar-
ture of All-American tailback
Craig Heyward?

”When we get to Johnstown
for fall camp, offensively we'll
have some questions, including
depth at tailback and who the
quarterback is going to be,” Gott-
fried said. "Defensively, I know

Basketball teams land recruits

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

Although the two Pitt basket-
ball programs, the Panthers and
the Lady Panthers, have taken
different courses in the last few
years, they do have at least one
thing in common —— their number
of recruits.

To date, both teams have
signed only one recruit, with the
Lady Panthers seemingly getting
the better of the deal.

0 Lady Panther head coach
Kirk Bruce signed Sandy Baker, a
5—foot—l1 forward“ from Quad-A
state champion Altoona High
School, during the early signing
period in November.

’’I think she's the best player on
that team,” Bruce said, which is

quite a compliment, considering ‘

Altoona finished the season 33-0
and won the ”mythical national

championship,” as Bruce said.

Baker is the only player Bruce
will sign, and he's highly optimis-
tic about her chances to succeed
at Pitt. ’’I didn't recruit her to sit
on the bench,” Bruce said. ’’I
think by the time she leaves, she
can be a Sally Sheerer—type
player.”

Sheerer was team captain as a
senior this year and led the Lady
Panthers in scoring and rebound-
ing as a junior.

”She [Baker] likes to get in

there and mix it up,” Bruce said.

0 While Bruce signed his
recruit long before the season
ended, Paul Evans didn't sign
anyone to the Panthers until last
Thursday.

Evans inked Gilbertlohnson, a
6—foot—8 forward from Lees-
McRae Junior College in North
Carolina who averaged 10.6
points and six rebounds per game
last season. ‘

Pitt has until the end of the
week to sign any other recruits.
