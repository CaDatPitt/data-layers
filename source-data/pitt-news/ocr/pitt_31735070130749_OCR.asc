Eric Pearman leads groundbreaking ceremonies‘ for the new Jewish
University Center on Forbes Avenue last Wednesday.

By building the new Jewish
University Center, local Jewish stu-
dents will finally have a place to

‘gather for study, social [events and‘

services., _
The new facility is five times

— larger than the current center, which

is a rented second—ﬂoor walk-up
of Forbes
Avenue and Craig Street in
Oakland.
At HiI1el’s current location, it’s
impossible to hold religious ser-
vices. . .
Although the current center
can’t accommodate the

Jewish college students living_in the

3,500‘.

  forward to new home

area, sophomore Anna Nys says the
new center will provide, a critical

‘meeting place for alumni, parents

and students.  _ . _ A

‘Pitt Hillel President Nir Golan ,
lauded the strategic location .-;.c.en-'
tered between Pitt and .Carnegie
Mellon ‘University on » Forbes
Avenue — and the ample space —-—,
12,000 square feet; ‘

“The facility will be large
enough to hold all denominations’ of
services at onetime, host our Friday
night dinners, any parties we have
through the year, and still have

ample space for lounges, computer 1

stations and a 1ibrary,’f-Golan said.
It’s much more than a building

A sobering ruling

for The Pitt News

SHANNON McLAUGHL|N'
News Editor

Students will have to continue
to shop around for the best drink
specials intown by reading The
City Paper and InPgh Weekly, as
The Pitt News has been forced to
continue excluding alcohol adver-
tising from its pages. ,

" In a ruling released by the Third
Circuit Court of Appeals on
Thursday, District Judge William L.
Standish decided that The Pitt
News’ first amendment rights were
not being violated by the controver-
sial Act 199. Standish heard the
case along with three other circuit
judges. 4 .

Act 199, an amendment to the

Pennsylvania liquor code intro»

duced in 1996, precludes The Pitt
News and “any booklet, program
book, yearbook, magazine, newspa-
per, periodical, brochure, circular
or other ‘similar"publication pub-

lished by, for or in behalf of any
educational institution” from pub-

lishing ‘alcohol-related ads.

‘ The state law was designed to
help curb underage drinking as well
as binge drinking’ on campus by
both adults and minors. :

Witold “Vic” Walczak, head of
the Pittsburgh chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union,
which represents The Pitt News,
argued that by dictating advertising

,-‘within the student newspaper, state:

officials were. dictating content, and
were therefore in violation of the

First Amendment, ‘according to --
,Control Board, who

Standish’s ruling. , _
Additionally, Walczak argued

that the law violated the First

Amendment freedom of the press

. guaranteed to Pitt News advertisers-

and the 75 percent of its readership

that is 21_ years of age or older.
The Commonwealth, represent-

ed by J. Bart DeLone, deputy attor-

ney general within the Appellate,

Litigation Section in Harrisburg,
successfully argued that The Pitt

News may have been able to assert
its own First Amendment rights, but
that its arguments on behalf of
advertisers and readers had no
standing.

“We were not surprised by the
court’s ruling,” DeLone said in a
telephone interview.

DeLone held that The Pitt News
was ineligible to assert the rights of
third parties, including readers and
advertisers, because the newspaper.
had not incurred any direct injury,

nor did it have any close, ‘personal

relationship with the third parties it
was trying to represent.

The only other _circumstance
under -which the court» would have
allowed The Pitt News to represent
readers and advertisers is in the
instance that readers and advertis-
ers were unable to represent them-
selves. .

The court’s decision reads that
the newspaper “lacks standing to
challenge Act 199 on behalf of
these third parties.” .

A - The court found that The Pitt
News could not represent the inter-
ests of advertisers or readers

because it “has not demonstrated.

that the advertisers  or -its adult

readers have any impediment to‘

bringing their own suit’ to challenge
the statute.” _

»“It’s suicide [for advertisers to
join the case]!” said Walczak,
explaining that Pitt News advertis-
ers declined inclusion in the litiga-
tion.-“No advertisers were willing to
join the court battle. Walczak said

the advertisers feared retaliation‘

from state police and the Liquor
enforce Act
199. '

While Walczak argued that The
Pitt News loses $17,000 in potential
advertising revenue on ’a yearly
basis, the court found the only eco-
nomic — damage suffered by the
newspaper to be “indirect” and
“incidental.” » - V '

Marketing and web design may be
established fields, but two local busi-
nesswomen are providing their interna-
tional clientele with new techniques to
do both. I

By doing this they are writing one
more chapter in Pittsburgh’s technolog-
ical success story. .

Carolla Zap and Andi Rieber, own-
ers and founders of the graphics design
firm Blue Rider Design, operate exact-
ly the kind of start-up the region needs,
said Dione Cahillane, assistant director
of the Institute for Entrepreneurial
Excellence. ’

“‘Blue Rider’s success is not only
great for Rieber and Zap, but it is also
great for the city of Pittsburgh as it is
proof that young, enterprising profes-
sionals can and do succeed here in the
Steel City,” Cahillane said.

Using a combination of graphic

arts and communication ‘design, the
firm designs Web sites and specializes
in a marketing technique called brand-
ing. »
Branding involves engineering cor-
porate identity through consistent
application of logos, ads and the media,
crafting the client’s image to fit its tar-
get market. 

For example, a soft drink compa— I

ny’s design must fit the niche in the
cola market. It must show that the prod-
uct meets a need within the scheme of
existing competitors. The alternative -—
a random image pitched to the general
consumer market — is less effective;
“We’re putting a new spin on a
business that has been around for the
last five years,” Rieber said. “We fuse

art and technology — and we’re push-

ing technology.”

Web site design was born around
1994, the year Rieber and Zap graduat-
ed from Carnegie Mellon University’s
fine arts and design program. ' V

“CMU was the birthplace of the
Internet,” Rieber said. Being surround-
edby this new technology gave the duo
a head start on capitalizing’ on the fast-
emerging market.

After CMU, launching a start-up
was the next logical step. Although
both Rieber and Zap were offered jobs
in major companies, they chose to stay
in Pittsburgh and pilot their own.

After operating out of their home
for several years, Rieber and Zap want-
ed to expand their services, so they
turned to Pitt’s Small Business
Development Center.

Funded through the State of

Pennsylvania and the Small Business
Administration, Pitt’s center offers
counseling and classes to 827 clients
last year. A public service organization
of the Katz School of Business, the
SBDC helped secure more than $11
million in various forms of public and
private ﬁnancing for clients.

Speaking from her eofﬁce on the
second ﬂoor of Bellefield Hall,
Cahillane said Blue Rider was a

dynamic mix of technologicalexpertise V

and marketing innovation.

The strength of the company is that
it accepts the client’s input, Cahillane"
said. “The client’s image is consistent
with what the company wants.” ,

Currently, the SBDC is seeing an
increasing number of start-up business-
es organized by people under the age of
35. Among this category of young pro-
fessionals, computer— and Internet-
based companies are also increasing.

“Young people are more seasoned
and ready for the marketplace at an ear-
lier age,” said Cahillane, explaining the
trend of young entrepreneurs

_ In addition to the emergence of an
electronically savvy generation, local
youths are going out on their own
because traditional hiring giants like
Mellon Ba11k and Alcoa aren’t employ-
ing as many people.’

To‘ meet the needs of Pitt student
entrepreneurs, the SBDC will open a
resource exclusively for them this fall
called Panther Labworks, which will
serve as an incubator for student inno-
vation. ‘

SBDC representatives helped Zap
and Rieber draft a business plan and
strategy for growth. Under the center’s
guidance, Blue Rider Design acquired a
state-of—the-art office in the Strip
District in October 1999 and also

' upped its staff and resources.

Blue Rider has acquired a national
clientele including Westinghouse, Fuel

Clip and Entigo’s Intrane. I For every A,
client, the firm researches new tech- "

niques and applies the latest technolo-

gies to the most recent characterization *

of the market.

The firm recently won the Small A

Business Administrations ' Young
Entrepreneur of the Year award for
Pennsylvania.

According to Ray Becki of the A’
Business
Administration, Rieber and Zap’s”‘

Pittsburgh Small

dynamic personalities make Blue Rider
Design successful. _

“They’re both very outgoing and
creative, and they’ve applied that ore»  » «

ativity to their business,” Becki said.
“Their willingness to take a chance is
what small businesses are made of.”

Honors society recognizes
outstanding humanitarians

AARON OGLETREE

The Pitt News

In the “Oresteia,” the ancient
Greek poet Aeschylus asks the ques-
tion, ‘,‘What? Is it a crime to help the
pious man, above all, when his hour
of need has come?”

The National Society of
Collegiate Scholars believes that not
only is it not a crime to assist those

H in need, but a virtue that should be

promoted through recognition among
one’s peers.

“The NSCS was created withthe
knowledge ' that with scholarship
there is a responsibility to develop
leadership and a duty to perform ser-
vice,” said NSCS Executive Director
Steve Loﬂin.

In aneffort to advance the lead-
ership skills and community involve-
ment for undergraduate freshmen
and sophomores throughout the
country, the N SCS is a selective,
non-profit, national honor society
that attempts to develop its mem-
bers’ sense of civic responsibility.

The NSCS provides “an opportu-
nity for college students to meet stu-

dents ‘with similar interests,” said’

Ciara Ginyard, a student assistant for
the NSCS.

One of the students recently.
accepted to Pitt’s NSCS chapter is
Renee Hartley, a sophomore business
major.-

Hartley believes that- her educa-
tion at Pitt isallowing her to excel in
fulfilling her career ambitions.

The high quality of Pitt teachers

 she has encountered is one of the

reasons for her advancement in and
out of the classroom. Pitt’s course
work options have allowed her to

incorporate her favorite classes —

mathematics and computers, while
still fulfilling her degree require-
ments.

But the plethora of options avail-

able has caused her to be uncertain ‘

about the career path she will ulti-
mately choose. I

Hartley, who describes herself as
“open-minded, shy, and a sports
lover,” unfortunately has not been
able to participate in extracurricular
activities because of her dedication
to maintaining good. grades.

But she plans to become an
active ,member in the community
once established in her career.

She believes that assisting others
should not be ‘limited to providing
financial relief to the needy, but
should include a physical presence
inserted into the given project.
Hartley asserts that she will not only
donate money to needy causes, but
become an active volunteer in vari-
ous projects. -

Hartley’s goal is “to be happy,
successful, and to make a difference
in the community by helping less
fortunate people through volunte_er—
ing.’.’

Ambition similar to hers is exact-
ly what the NSCS is hoping to col-
lect as they transform their potential
into reality. A

The NSCS has already made
great progress as an honor society in
its own right. Since its establishment
in 1994 at the Georgetown
University, the society’s accomplish-
ments include the creation of 100
chapters throughout the United
States, more than 100,000 members
and 53,000 new members.

Hartley and several others will
be recognized for their accomplish-
ments during an induction ceremony
at Pitt this fall.

Pitt wins four National
Resource Center awards
again .

The University Center for
International Studies ' at the
University of Pittsburgh has once
again received major national recog-
nition with the U.S. Department of
Education’s redesignation of four of
Pitt’s area studies programs as
National Resource Centers. The des-
ignation carries withgit an award of
approximately $3.5 million.

“It is gratifying that, once again,
,Pitt’s status as a national leader in
-‘international education has been
affirmed,” said UCIS director

Burkart Holzner. “Given the intense— .

ly competitive national environment,
which has only become more com-
petitive over the years, this is, a
tremendous success not only for the
University, but for our entire region.”

‘_‘This designation will allow us to
create even more opportunities» here
at Pitt for internationally-minded stu-
dents and faculty.”

The~NRC program is authorized
through Title VI of the Higher
‘Education Act and administered
through the Department of
Education’s International Education
and Graduate Programs Service.
Through NRC, the Department of
Education provides grants to colleges
and ’ universities to - strengthen and

maintain U.S. capacity in foreign lan-
guages and international studies
expertise. Included in the NRC grants
are foreign language and area studies
fellowships to assist graduate stu-

dents in those fields.

The Asian Studies Program,'the
Center for Latin American Studies,
the Center for Russian and East
European Studies, and the Center for

West European Studies (which hous— _

es one'of only. 10 European union
centers in the United States) are the
four programs at Pitt which were des-
ignated as NRCS. These UCIS centers
have held NRC distinction for more
than two decades. In addition to these
nationally recognized centers, Pitt is

‘also the home of theglnternational

Business Center, a joint venture of
the Katz School of Business and
UCIS,'federally recognized and fund-
ed as a Center of Excellence under
Title VI (Part B) of the Higher
Education Act.

did not want to declare this statute
unconstitutional,” Walczak said.
“Factually, it’s not incidental,” he
said. “This is a law intended to
affect [The Pitt News].”

Walczak attempted to prove that
by eliminating alcohol advertising,
the length of each issue of The Pitt
News was affected, thereby affect-
ing the paper’s content. '

He also argued that the lost rev-
enue affected the newspaper’s abil-
ity to purchase new equipment and
renovate its facilities, giving it a
disadvantage in comparison with
other newspapers able to publish
such ads-

The current ‘legal battle stems

P from a 1997 incident, in which the

specials. After battling the issue
in court, The Pitt News’ lawsuit
against the Pennsylvania attor-
ney general (and various others)
has perplexingly failed.

Here’s the lowdown: The
law is crazy. It’s unconstitution-
al, depriving The Pitt News of

-its freedom of speech, dictating

the contents of an independent
paper.,Even the University has-
n’t tried to manhandle the rights
of the press. '

Is our audience really so
impressionable?,We don’t think
so. We know that 75 percent of
Pitt News readers are. either 21
or older. The other 25 percent
are surrounded by alcohol
advertisements; who could miss
the silhouette of Absolut vodka
gracing the ,back of Time, or
Captain ,Morgan’s grinning
pirate face splayed across a bill-

‘: board? Beer commercials air on

network TV, before the eyes of_
toddlers. Ads in a school paper
won’t fill the streets with colle-
giate whinos. Stacks of The Pitt
News lie next ti) InPgh Weekly
and The City Paper; both papers
print liquor ads,’ and both are
free. A grade schooler could
pick them up.

And how come the attorney
general hasn’t descended upon
the Daily Pennsylvanian’, the
University of Pennsylvania’s
school paper? They. still have
alcohol-related ads. Not to be
catty, but if the state is going to
implement a ridiculous law, let’s
not leave anybody out. 

Ironically, we ‘can print
advertisements for tobacco, off-
shore gambling, pornography
and strip clubs — all the stuff
that moralists hate —.and the
businesses paying for the ads
don’t get fined. Older editions of
The Pitt News were largely
based on the cigarette industry.
If marijuana and cocaine were
legal, we could advertise those,

’too. Why should alcohol be any

different? Will alcohol advertis-
ing destroy lives, while gam-
bling won’t? The argument is
obtuse, and therefore, so is the
law. - .
One last thing for the attor-

Historicizing the head injury

'8 I recently noticed a headline that stated
that a group of concerned soccer dads had
invented protective headgear for the much-

too-violent sport of soccer. While soccer

may be considered’ as violent sport, in which

' feet pound a grassy turf and legs trip other

legs, I’m still not convinced headgear is nec-
essary. But before examining this important
issue, I’d like t6 walk through history and
lookat the storied past of sports and head
injuries. _

It all began with the Greeks (didn’t
everything?) who had the novel idea of chal-
lenging strength and endurance not in battle
but in Olympic games. While the Greeks did
make strides in diplomacy, they

used in athletics because of the
Greeks’ superior medical knowl-
edge: They feared that helmets
would iriterruptfthe b1ood.ﬂow to
the brain. These beliefs were based on com-
plex theories about the universe proposed by
Plato and Aristotle. These beliefs are still
taught invuniversities today to deter the use
of helmets in young student athletes.

As a result, many students were impaled
through the head playing catch with javelins
ore‘ knocked unconscious with discuses.
Hence, the Greek Empire fell to the Romans
because all the young student athletes were
killed off due to a lack of headgear.
Nowadays, this problem has been corrected;
athletes no longer play catch with the javelin
until they’ve strapped on a helmet.

The Romans learned from their prede-
cessors and became the first to introduce hel-
mets into sport. While most Romans were
mere spectators, they were in fact concerned
for the well-being of their Christian athletes.
They found that the "lives of the gladiators
were lengthened by the use of a helmet. I
believe ‘it was one of the Caesars — there
were a lot —'—— who noted that a broad sword
or battle axe to the cranium (Latin for head)
doesn’t do anyone any good and spoils the
body for later cruciﬁxion. ‘ .

They passed the tradition onto medieval

CARL

SCHNEIDER

 

England, a time of chivalrous sport. Two
men on horseback and clad in armor would
take up the helmet and lance and charge at
one another in the name of sports entertain-
ment (a term that would not be used again
until the late 20th century with the rise of
professional wrestling). Their first attempt at
safety gear was a failure as it provided too
much cranium protection. The knights’
vision was so impaired that luck, not aim,

.. determined the outcome of the match.

Hence, the English soon gave up such bar-
baric sporting events for the more gentle-
manly pursuits of rugby and yes, soccer.
(Many argue that soccer fans should wear

sport of fencing was popular
among the upper class nobles
who, like the Greeks, were more
concerned with academics than
athletics.

This trend of helmetless sport continued
until the modern age when athletics became
available to everyone. Quarterbacks discov-
ered that it was not healthy to get hit across
the head and neck by a 300—pound man.
Baseball players required helmets when
pitchers began hurling balls over ninety
miles an hour past their bare temples.
Eventually even hockey players began wear-
ing hehnets, although they still denounce the
use of a mouthpiece (fewer teeth improves a
player’s Canadian French).

But what’s so dangerous about soccer?
Throughout history there have been many
dangerous sports — Roman gladiators
swinging maces at one another, knights
spearing one another, ugly hockey ﬁghts -
but soccer? Are soccer moms and dads too

loverprotective of their kids’ craniums? I

think so. Soccer isn’t violent enough to war-
rant an on—site doctor let alone a hehnet.
Besides, just imagine how silly all those 10-
year-olds would look running around in
shorts with buckets on their heads. What’s
next? Basketball and Ping-Pong, no doubt.

Bself-interested Ia

Activists have made the past few
years monumental, turning normal
protests into self—interested money-
making ventures.

The first major target was the
“big tobacco” companies Phillip
Morris and R.J. Reynolds. The initial
cause was understandable: to halt the
accused child-oriented marketing
tools, such as the late Joe Camel.

This plan made many concerned
parents happy and seemed quite logi-
cal, but in time it wasn’t enough. The
children weren’t the only ones affect-
ed by these tobacco companies; long-
time smokers with health problems
from the habit were due compensa-
tion.

Individuals sued, demanding mil-

lions from the companies they sup-

ported for many years. Suits moved
to the state and federal levels, and the
tobacco companies settled, paying
hundreds of millions of
dollars to states, individu-
als and the federal govern-
ment. Further punishment
required tobacco compa-
nies to institute a public
anti-smoking campaign
toward teenagers.

tions to the federal revenue. This
hurts the farmers who were told to
switch from farming cotton and other
cash crops to farming tobacco, as the
government that encouraged them to
switch is attacking the
companies who write the
farmers’ paychecks.

The anti—smoking
campaign has given us
the “Think. Don’t
smoke” commercials —— not nearly as
catchy as “think before you drink,”
but equally ﬂawed. Many underage

Pitt students think before they drink .

drink, not ‘whether to drink.

Evidence of the effectiveness of

the anti—smoking campaign may be
seen in the new freshman class this
fall. Though most freshmen are 18
years old, smoking usually begins
years before, and a television com-
mercial probably did not deter them
from the habit.

The anti—smoking Web site
“thetruth.com” is disappointing, to
say the least. You might expect to
find the number of aliens kept in Area

51, but one quick look at the site and '

most will simply browse on by. The
rest of the government’s share of the

tobacco companies’.settlement is lost-

in the system. Most of the money has
simply been redistributed to various
government programs, hence a bud-
get surplus.

So what’s next? Guns. That’s
right, the hot topic Rosie O’Donnell

doesn’t want you thinking about

unless you’re on her side. The battle
cry was again for the children,

13,000 of whom are being killed,

every year. Or is it 13 every day? Or
nine? Or two? Facts have become so
muddled that complaints are impossi-
ble to believe. Lawsuits are failing,
so a new target must be found.

‘ Now for the new target, fast food.
Most prepared _food has" a higher fat
content than h0me—cooked food,
which is leading the time-pressed
American public into a downward,
overweight spiral. Health problems
caused by obesity are obvious _-——
heart disease, diabetes and countless
others. People are working longer
hours and have less time to cook,
forcing families to eat at restaurants.

So what should be done? Perhaps

a lawsuit against the fast-food com— _

panies is in order. After all, their

products make American children fat..

Maybe People for Ethical Treatment
of Animals could join in the suit; I’m
sure they have a few complaints.

Maybe an excise tax on prepared ~

food is the answer. Jack up food
prices to increase government rev-
enue and begin an anti-restaurant

campaign, encouraging families to ‘S '

eat at home. .
People will now have toiwork

longer hours to afford the same food,

allowing them less time to prepare

food. Thus, the American people will .

have to eat at restaurants because
they have less time to eat. What a

beautiful Catch-22; Joseph Heller
himself couldn’t imagine a better‘_

example.
Lawsuits are not the solution to

. such societal problems. The solution

is to start at the source of the prob-

-lem, the individual decision-maker.
.That’s you. "

Nicholas R. Sobocinski never resort? ‘

ed to an unnecessary lawsuit.

If you haven’t seen a sci-fi ﬂick in
the past 20 years, then you might fall
for the all explosion tricks that most
sci—fi/action ﬁlms are employing -
you know, the ones that are being used
to make obscenely expensive films.
“Titan A.E.,” an animated feature deal-
ing with an alien race that destroys

Earth in an attempt to eliminate the
human race, uses these same tricks, but

does it in such a conventional way that
audiences might have to stiﬂe a few

’. yawns.

The story begins in 3028, where,
the narrator explains, the human race
has mastered space travel and has been
around the galaxy. Due to Earth’s

exploration of space, the planetis dis- K

covered by an evil alien race known as
the Drej. The Drej, for no apparent rea-
son, fear the “huma_n spirit” and decide
to attack Earth. The human race

defends itself but is helpless because V
the Drej are made entirely of energy.
Unable to kill the Drej, the human race7

is forced to board spaceships and ﬂee

earth_. .
This is where the main character of
Kale is first shown as a 4-year-old

alien satellite. By this time humans are
near extinction, surviving mostly on
“drifter colonies” in space and consid-

only chanceto reunite the human race,

 Grunge like it’s goin’ outta st

CYNTHIA YOGMAS

Explosion and Boss Hog. Within the last decade  ~ A V   A  

Staff Writer

Grunge is not dead. In fact, forget everything you ever
' thought grunge stood for, because it never happened, not
this way. Royal Trux epitomizes true grunge —~ sweaty,
dirty rock—and-rollers with bad attitudes and a rock star men-
tality. Charisma like that hasn’t been seen‘ since the classic

rock era of the ‘70s.

Royal Trux had their fair share of ups and downs over
the last decade and a half. Jennifer Herrema and Neil
Haggerty, masterminds behind the Trux, could very well be
rock’s classic couple. Both recovered ﬁom heavy drug
addictions, both dragged through the toil and trouble of
major label status, and here they-are, survivors, coming back

to kick dirt in any doubtful "faces.

Royal Trux emerged from the ashes of the demise of
legendary rnid-’80s noise-rockers Pussy Galore. Haggerty
played guitar for the band until the bitter end. When P.G.
split (apparently on bad terms), he focussed on Writing and
" recording with his then-live-in girlfriend Herrema, and thus
came the birth of the Trux. Some of the other members of
HG. later branched off to form the Jon Spencer Blues

  
  

‘ andahalf, T1ux’s music went through several nec- . ‘   V l . _ 1
essary metamorphoses. Their first few albums on ' ' ‘ — 7
the indie label Drag City were released when Jen
and Neil were deep in drug addiction, and it shows
irrthe rambling, nearly incoherent noise rock that
could only be, if anything, a very acquired taste. In
1995 they signed to major label Virgin Records for
a brief stint of two albums in two years. Now, home
again at Drag City, Trux produced several albums
with their now clean and drug-free status. More
toned down than before, the inﬂuence of the
Rolling Stones andgother classic rock bands is more
apparent. Their music is much more accessible to
the picky, ever-changing tastes of rock enthusiasts.

As production and recording speed demons,
Trux has released 13 albums in 10 years. Haggerty
and Herrema even produce several other bands
under the title “Adam and Eve.” They are currently on
tour promoting their latest release, Pound for Pound.

With classic rock appeal and a knack for bad-ass,
in-your-face performance, Royal’Trux are wild and
wonderful. And the best part about them is that you

* always feel a little dirty after listening. V

The Pitt News

Audiences won’t be fooled. Just
because they’re sitting in a magniﬁcent
new theater, a less—than-dazzling script is
still going to be noticed.

For example, “Ferris Wheel”p
opens the brand-new Henry
Theater.
Heymann (who also
serves as the
show’s set designer)
is a. former faculty
member at Pitt. The
space is a quaint 150—seat
thrust stage located in the
former lower lobby of the
Stephen Foster. Memorial.
The Heymann marks the third
new theater -to open in
Pittsburgh in the last six months,

CMU’s Chosky Theater. ’,
While the venue itself is quite
spectacular, the play is not. The setting _
is July 1969 at Kennywood Park where
four cousins gather together for a cele-
bration. The party is in honor of‘ Lisa
(Elena Passarello), who is returning from
a stint “somewhere.” As the play unfolds,
secrets about each of them are revealed.

They were tough to spot, but they were there.
Lost in the blur of birdies made by former
Penguins star Dan Quinn, five former Pitt football
stars also competed in last weekend’s Mellon
Mario Lemieux Celebrity Invitational, held at The
Club at Nevillewood. 4 —

For every birdie or eagle by Quinn or A1 Del
Greco, there was a missed par putt by Marty
Schottenheimer or John Congemi. For every drive
right down the middle by tournament host
Lemieux or tennis great Ivan Lendl, there was a
hooked shot in the rough _by Mark May or Bill

with the players rallying to raise money to fight the
deadly disease of cancer. a

One person with a unique perspective was» for-
mer NHL star John Cullen. Cullen was diagnosed
with cancer in 1996 but battled back to return to
the ice, a similar situation to the one that Lemieux
went through in the mid-’90s when he fought
Hodgkin’s Disease.

“Anytime I can do something to raise money

for the fight against cancer, I will do it,” Cullen ,

said. “This tournament is a wonderful thing.”

And. for every great approach shot by retired

approach that landed in the sand trap, hit by retired

mellows in his retirement. He seems to

me. The former Chicago Bears quar-

Mike Schmidt also left an impression
on me. Schmidt, who is supposedly

Former Pitt baseball stars Lydic and Coughenour sign contracts with Astros

BRAD CUPRIK .

"Colorado in the early

Assistant Sports Editor

It didn’t take long for recent Major League

Baseball draftees Joe Lydic and Jory Coughenour to
sign on the dotted line.
" The Houston Astros signed Lydic and
Coughenour, and both players will report to the
short-season A—league Auburn Doubledays of the
New York-Penn League on Friday.

Lydic, a third baseman, who is tied for first on
Pitt’s all—time home run list with 33, had one year
of eligibility left. A

“The original offer was a little low, so we
got them to come up a bit,” Lydic said in a
phone interview yesterday.

, Lydic got help from a personal
advisor who also helped
David Nied sign with

1990s and current
Arizona Diamondback
Steve Finley.

The terms of
Lydic’s signing
bonus were not

released by Lydic.
However, he

said that he and

Coughenour will

each receive $850 a

month for living

‘expenses and food,

as well as $20 a day

on the road

and $10 a

day at home

for meal rations.
The contract ‘gives

the Astros rights to both play-

. ers for seven years and six seasons, but new con-

tracts have to be signed each year.

The only way the contract becomes void is if
either player is traded to another organization.

The two players were among seven draftees that
the Astros signed on Friday, with Lydic being the
highest of Houston’s picks to sign a contract. '

The Doubledays play a 76-game schedule,
starting Tuesday at Jamestown and running through
Sept. 6.

The New York—Penn League also features the
Williamsport Crosscutters, an affiliate of the
Pittsburgh Pirates.

Auburn, is located about six hours north of
Pittsburgh, a few miles east of Syracuse, N.Y.

The Doubledays are named after Abner
Doubleday, who invented the game of modern
baseball in the mid—1800s.

The team’s logo is of an 1800s baseball player,

complete
with a
_ large, curly
mustache, swinging a hat.
“The bus rides will be a lit-
tle tough, but we’re used to them
at Pitt,” Lydic said. '

Coughenour, a senior last season,
was selected in the 20th round and agreed
with Lydic’s assessment of bus rides, but was
still extremely excited. _

“I’m ready to go up,” Coughenour said. “We
only have a couple days of practice and then we
start.” . . ' .

Coughenour was the Panthers’ top pitcher this
year with a 5-5 record. He struck out 52 batters in
76 2/3 innings pitched.

After the season is finished, both players will

probably play in the Instructional League in the
fall, but if not, Lydic said he will take classes at
Pitt, as he is just 30 credits from graduation.

Sunday, June 25

   

 

Although none of the former‘
Panthers were in contention for the
overall championship, they had to
feel better when they saw‘ the scores
of players like Charles Barkley and
Lynn Swann. Barkley shot 97-111-89
to finish next—to—last, only to be out-
done by Swann, who shot 109-110-
114.

Barkley’s therapy for his strug-
gles seemed to be his humor, as he
showed after finishing up his round

L at the ninth hole on Sunday.

“Lynn, are you fishing?” Barkley
yelled, as Swann attempted to
retrieve his ball out of the water.

After Swann found the ball and
finally got on the green, he lined up
to hit his putt, only to hearBark-ley
say, “I might be wrong, but I don’t
think this putt is to win the champi-
onship.” 

Swann was diplomatic about his ’
golf game. ‘ V

“_I like to play the game, but‘I

' don’t get out nearly enough to be
good,” Swann, said. “I just enjoy
playing" in this tournament because
the participation really helps people.”
