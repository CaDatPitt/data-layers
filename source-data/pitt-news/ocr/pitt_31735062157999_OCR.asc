SchoolPact
Renewed ? ?

Student Congress, at their

Oct. 4 meeting, Voted for the

renewal of the Rally Damage
Pact, but according to inter-
views with student leaders of Car-

‘ negie Tech and Duquesne, nothing

has been done to carry out their
plans.

The pact requires the four local
college Student Councils involved
to pay for damages done after
victories if the guilty parties’ can-
not be found‘.

Pitt News contacte_d George
Mile student council president
of Carnegie Tech, ,who said, “I
don’t know anything about it.”

Miley mentioned that he was
circulating Tech’s pact from last
year, which is a watered-down
version of the proposal made by
Emil Herman this year. .

Tech’s agreement does not go
so far as to hold their student
council responsible for any ﬁnan-

cial damage done by their stu-.

dents.

A telephone interview with
Antonie Misiti, head of Duquesne’s
student body, brought the same
reply as Miley’s. Misiti wanted to
be “briefed” on the whole situa-
tion, for apparently he was never
contacted, leaving him, completely
in the dark.

He suggested however that Pitt
send a representative to their
next student council meeting on
Oct. 28, At that time, Misiti sug-
gested, the whole Duquesne coun-

cil might be approached on the’

matter. -

Invitational ' 

Debateincn

Pitt’s-debating team, under
the direction of Robert" New-
man, will travel to Purdue
University Thursday to take
part in the seventh annual
Invitational Forensic Confer-
ence. I’

Seventeen colleges and univer-
sities, ranging from. the United
States Military Academy in the
East to Utah in the West, will
debate the topic, “Resolved: That 
the United States should extend
diplomatic recognition to the
Communist government in China.”

Irving Bloom, Col ’56, and Bob.
Dickinson, Eng. ’55, will defend
the aﬂirmative side while Paul.
Balles, Col ’55, and Danny Levitt,
Col ’56, argue for the negative.‘

Last year Pitt’s Negative debat- ’, J
ers were undefeated in the Pur-
_due tournament. In estimating his
team’s chances this year coach
Newman emphasized that Pitt
will be up against predominately
Big 10 oppositioh. “This is our ‘
ﬁrst big" event of the year,” he
said. “We can’t predict an_ unde- .
feated record now but we expect
to come back with a decent show-
ing.” _ .

Other schools entered in the 
tournament include Au-gustana * 
College, , Case, ‘ Illinois, Indiana,
Kentucky, Michigan State, Mis-”
souri, Notre Dame, Ohio State,
Purdue, Southern Illinois, Army,
Utah, Wes’tern Michigan and Wis-
consin. “ 

Last «Tuesday four debaters ,'
gave their Purdue topic a trial
run before the Oakmont-Verona
Rotary club as part of a program
to increase community interest in
the affairs of the day.

 iln Reply .. .

15,511 persons seem to .have attached themselves to a -

stigma according to a reader of the Post-Gazette who signs
his name I AMEN. ,3, . ,_ .

, A letter appeared on the editorial page of the Post
last, Friday in which a “long time resident of . V. . this fair
and‘ glorious city” stated thatimmediate steps should be
taken to change the name of the University of Pittsburgh

 because his many friends say, “I see you got beat ‘again ,

Saturday,” thereby -assuming that the city and the’ school
are common ground. . _ ‘
Educational institutions such as the University of Pitts-

~ burgh were established in order to -obliterate such crass ig-

norance but apparently this aim has been /faulty, at least
in the case of‘ AMEN. , 4 e _ '
I don’t know how AMEN feels, but we at the University

‘are justiﬁably proud to say that we are a part of a school

which produces such men asDr. Jonas Salk and. his col-

leagues who have worked unstintingly for years in a grim

battle against Infantile Paralysis.

We take, pride in the'Varsi_tyi Marching Band, one of
the ﬁnest in the nation’; and we are proud of our athletes
for, even when they lose, they need not excuse themselves.

Pitt is perhaps the most distinguished university in the
world from the standpoint of architecture but it is much

’ morethan just‘ a skyscraper. It is 15 thousand students

working hard and oftimes late. into the night for a sound
education. Each ofthese persons is striving for a background
of knowledge upon which to build not only his life but
the lives of generations yet unborn.

Such determination cannot be overlooked for it was
just such determination which formed the basis for the
United States. The television set in the living room, the
car in the garage, and the supersonic aircraft ** ﬂying at
invisible heights, all had their conception and resultant
birth in the brains of men who had been taught to think
logically and clearly and had then set out to systematically
transform their thoughts to eralities.

It is to such men as these that we must turn when we
stop to wonder what"has made America the country that
it is today. And it is to the schools of the nation that we

"A football contest is as many-

referee, sees things through a

STUDYING MADE SIMPLE .

I have passed my thirty-ﬁfth birthday, and my dewlaps droop and
my transmission needs oil. More and more my eyes turn 1nwa_rd,
reminiscing, sifting the past, browsing lovingly among my souvenirs,
for at my time of life memories are all a man has. . .

And most precious are the memories of college. It still makes my

I pulses quicken and myold glands leap to life just to think of it.

Ah, I was something then! “Swifty” my friends used to call _me,
or “Rakehell” or “Candle-at-both-Ends” or “Devil Take the Hind-
most.” My phone was ringing all the time. “Come on, Dev1l-Take-t_he-
Hindmost,” a cohort would say, “let’s pile into the old convertible
and live up a storm. I know a place that serves all-bran after hours.”

So it went-—-—night after mad night, kicks upon kicks, sport that, ‘
wrinkled care derides, laughter holding both his sides. “Come on,‘

“Candle-at-Both-Ends,”, my companions would plead, “sing us an-

other two hundred verses of Sweet Violets.” _
“N 0, my companions,” I would reply with a gentle but ﬁrm smile,’

“we must turn homeward, for the cock has long since crowed.”

“’Twas not the cock,” they would answer, laughing merrily.

“ ’Twas Sam Leghorn‘doing his imitation of a chicken!”

And, sure enough, ’twas. Crazy, madcap Sam Leghorn. How I
miss his gaiety and wit! I never tired of hearing his imitation of
a chicken, nor he of giving it. I wonder what’s become of him. Last
I heard he was working as a weathervanegin Tacoma.

Oh, we were a wild and jolly gang in those days. There was Sam
Leghorn with his poultry imitations. There was Mazda Watts who
always wore a lampshade on her head. There was Freddie‘Como
who stole a‘ dean. There was Cap Queeg who always carried two
steel marbles in his hand. There was Emily Hamp who gilded her
house mother. ’ V

Yes, we were wild and jolly, and the wildest and jolliest was I . . .
But not right away. I blush to admit that in my freshman year I

- was dull, stodgy, and normal. I ﬁnally corrected this loathesome

condition, but for a while it_was touch and go. And, dear reader-—-
especially dear freshman reader-——be warned: it can happen to you.

The makers of Philip Morris have bought this space so I can
bring you a message each week. There is no more important message
I cangive you than the following: College can be beautiful. Don’t
louse it up with studying. . _

That was my mistake..‘At ﬁrst, cowed by college,  studied so much
that I turned into a dreary, blinking creature, subject to dry-mouth
and fainting ﬁts. For a year this dismal condition _prevailed—but
then I learned the real function of college. And what is that? I’ll tell

A you what: to prepare you to face the realities of the world. And

what do you need to face the realities of the world? I'll tell you
what——poise, that’s what you need. And how do you get poise? I’ll
tell you how: not by keeping your nose inga book, you may be sure!

Relax! Live!- Enjoy! . . . That's how you get poise. Of course you
have to study, but be poised about it. Don’t be like some clods
who spend every single night buried in a book. Not only are they not
learning poise; they are also eroding their eyeballs. The truly poised
student knows better than to make the whole semester hideous with
studying. He knows that the night before the exam is plenty of time

' to study.

Yes, I’ve heard that lots of people have condemned cramming. But
have you heard who these people are? They are the electric light and
power interests, that’s who! They want you to sit up late and study
every night. so you’ll use more electricity and enrich their bulging
coffers. Don’t be a sucker!

Clearly, cramming is the only sensible way to study. But beware!
Even cramming can be overdone. Take it easy. On the nightibefore
your exam, eat a hearty dinner. Then get a date and go out and eat
another hearty dinner. Then go park someplace and light up a
Philip Morris. Enjoy the peaceful pleasure it offers. Don’t go
home until you're good and relaxed. 5

Once at home, relax. Do not, however, fall asleep. This is too
relaxed. To insure wakefulness, choose a chair that is not too
comfortable. For example, take a chair with nails pointing up
through the seat——or a chair in which somebody is already sitting.

Place» several packs of Philip Morris within. easy reach. Good
mild tobacco helps you to relax, and that's what Philip Morris is——
good mild tobacco. But Philip Morris is more than just. good mild
tobacco; it is also cigarette paper to keep the good mild tobacco from
spilling all over the place. _ s ,

Now you’ve got the uncomfortable chair and the"-Philip Morris.
Now you need light. Use the lit end of your Philip Morris. Do not
enrich the electric power interests.

Read your textbook in a slow, poised manner. Do not underline. It
reduces the re-sale value of your book. Always keep your books in
prime re—sale condition; you never know when you’ll need getaway
money. , ' .

As you read you will no doubt come across many things you don’t
understand. But don’t panic. Relax. Play some records. Remove a
callus. Go out and catch some night crawlers.

Relax. Be poised. Stay loose. And remember—if things" really close
in, you can always take up teaching. , ~

For the first time in IM history,

more widespread participaton in
IM sports. ' ‘

Under this set-up all IM teams

“ will strive for one trophy, the

winner being proclaimed as the
Pitt champion instead of the IF
or Independent champ.

At present the IF teams and the
Independent teams play among
themselves, sending their cham-
pions against each other to deter-
mine the campus champion.

stretch. .

But the upcoming triangular
contest with Army and Manhattan

as a major stumbling block in

possibly shed some light on what
to expyct from the Olsonmen in

allowed only two goals in four

Favored Penn State To Open
Season for Frosh Gridders

By BERNIE MORRIS

Injuries continued to be

the major stumbling block as

the Panther Freshmen squad primed for its opener with. a
heavilyfavored Penn State eleven.

Seven gridders were on the injured list and only three
were expected to dress for the inaugural. Gordon Oliver,
Bill Fogler, Russ Willis, Fred Benke, Jim Theodore, Joe
D’Addio, and Gene Minarchick head, the casualtyllist and

only Theodore, Folger, and Wlllls¢

will see any action against the
Lions. I
Two of the speedsters, half-
backs Theodoreand Willis have_
been withheld from all contact

work and the coaching staff has -

been unable to get a line on
their performances.

No definite starting lineup has

been announced, but as of the

moment the following boys appear
to have the edge in the battle for
a staring berth:

Ends, Karl Gustafsen and Ed
Humeston; tackles, Ron Kissel and
Dick Carr; guards, Gene Uccellini
and John Guzik; center, Jim Saba-
tini. The backﬁeld will probably
be ‘composed of Tony Capparelli

a, hard-hitting back from Beaver

_ Coach Steve Petro, when quer-
ied about his squad, said, “We still
have a lot of work and we’re not
nearly as far advanced as I would
like to be.”

Word leaking out of the Penn
State campus is that their
freshman squad is one of the
very best. They are reputed to
have a heavier team than their
varsity brethren and this could
forbode trouble for the Pan-
