Brennan says ojﬁcers followed procedure in Towers incident

Byjohn Temple
Staﬂ’ Writer

The Department of Public Safety has
determined that the police officer who
struck Pitt student Ryan Fitzpatrick with a
nightstick while trying to stop a fight did
not break department policy.

“We had a variety of different stories
from people, but the basic core of the
thing indicated that [Fitzpatrick] kept ﬂailing
his arms and hitting the police ofﬁcer who

of Public Safety William Brennan said.
During a three—week investigation, the

‘ department interviewed 11 witnesses of the

incident, some of whom said the officer
used excessive force. But Brennan said the
majority revealed that Fitzpatrick, who is
charged with assaulting a police officer,
continued to strike out after being pulled
away from the other man.

“I don’t think you can really compare
this incident to what happened in Los
Angeles,” he said. “There was one blow,
the resistance was overcome, and that was

the end of it.”

On Nov. 1, Fitzpatrick and a man who
was unaffiliated with the university were
fighting on the Towers patio when two
campus police officers pulled them apart.
Several students in the crowd at the scene
protested when one officer struck
Fitzpatrick, knocking him down.

Fitzpatrick’s aunt, Audrey Fitzpatrick
Smith, sent a letter last week to the depart-
ment calling for the termination of the offi-
cer and protesting that Fitzpatrick was
arrested while the other man was released

at the scene.

“We break up a lot of fights on campus
where we don’t charge anybody with a
crime,” Brennan said. “Neither individual
was charged with the fight. The only
charges were the assault on the police offi-
cer.”

Brennan, who is drafting a response to
Smith’s letter, said that the department
found 16 student witnesses and scheduled
interviews with them.

Over 80 members of the Pitt
Greek system packed the Inter-
Fraternity Council meeting
Tuesday night to find out who
would be the next IFC officers.

Pi lambda Phi member Jeremy
Weiss won the presidency in a
race that was tied after the first
round of voting. The revote result-
ed in Weiss winning by a single
vote over Edward lift of Delta Tau
Delta.

Weiss ran on a platfomi focused
on building organization within
IFC. In his speech to the voters, he
stressed that IFC must improve the
monitoring of social events and
extend rush to minorities and non-
traditional students. He expects to
make steady progress during his
term, which begins injanuary.

“I think we need to concentrate
on the relations between fraterni-
ties,” Weiss said. “We must refomi
the monitoring process to be less
biased and encouiage more inter-
fraternity social events. When we

can achieve’ this unity, we will nat-
urally have a more successful rush
because we’ll all be working
together —— not against each
other.”

Ifft, who passed out his detailed
plans for IFC in his presidential
bid, was elected external vice
president over challengers Larry
Semovitz and Sean Robertson. In
his speech, he explained that he
could help Weiss pursue his
objectives for improving the orga-
nization.

In the discussion before ballot-

is elected next IFC President

ing, several members endorsed
Ifft, citing the close presidential
race and the advantage of having
two people qualified to be presi-
dent serving on the executive
board. l

“I think [Ifffs election] is excel-
lent. There may be some refonns
to have his position more involved
in rush,” Weiss said. “He will be a
great asset, I think its in the IFC’s
best interest to have both of us
serving as officers.”

In prepaiing for rush, Weiss will
also be working closely with Phi

THE PI'lT NEWS, Thursday, December 3, 1992

Reduce stress during ﬁnals without resorting to food

inal exams are coming. This- is

the time of the year when stress

levels reach an all-time high. For

manystudents, increased stress

leads to increased eating. It is not

uncommon for students to increase

their food intake by almost 1,000 calo-

ries a day while studying for final

exams. If it takes 3,500 calories to gain

one pound of weight, one could easily

finish the semester with a few extra
pounds

000
Favorite snack foods of Pitt students
tend to be high in calories, fat, sugar

_and salt. Mo-st college females need

about 1,200 to 1,500 calories a day to
maintain their weight; malesabout
1,800 to 2,000. One “snack” of about
700 calories would take care of half of
a female’s calorie needs for a ‘day and
one third of a male’s. Below are exam-
ples of popular snack foods:
Snack Food_

Calories per “snack”

-potato chips, 8 oz. bag 1,140
-peanuts, one cup 985
-cookies, chocolate chip,10 720
-crackers, 1/2 of 10 oz. box 700
-donuts, four 650

»-microwave popcorn, one bag 530

\

Most students feel that it really
doesn’t matter what the food is as long
as they have something in their mouth.
Many say that after a while the food has
no taste, and eating becomes uncon-
scious. Before they know it the bag or
the box is empty. So why waste calories

 

on food you aren’t tasting and probably
won’t remember eating?

If you have to have a snack while
studying, choose foods that are lower in
calories — foods that will fill you up
but not out. Below are some examples
of healthy snacks:

-yogurt, 8 oz. carton 240

-vanilla wafers,10 210

-popcorn, air popped, six cup 180

-fresh fruit, two pieces 115

There are more’ healthy alternatives to
reducing stress while studying. Many
students find a brisk 15-minute walk
helpful.

Others benefit from the relaxation
techniques and skills they learn in
Stress Management Workshops. And
then there are some who don’t wait
until the last minute to write papers and
study for finals.

These students report very little
stress. No matter what type of student
you are, the bottom line is to pass.

The Student Health Service and the
Pitt Program Council are offering three
Finals Survivals Workshops that will
offer tips on test—taking, time manage-
ment, relaxation techniques and nutri-
tion. 5

They are scheduled for Dec. 8, from 2
to 2:30 p.m. and 5 to 3:30 p.m., and
Dec. 9 from 6:30 to 7 p.m. All work-
shops will be held in the William Pitt
Union, Room 510.

Pitt student pistol-whipped near stadi

Byjohn Temple
Staff Writer

A 17-year-old male allegedly
pistol-whipped a male Pitt student
with a long-barrelled BB handgun
near the Pitt Stadium Monday
afternoon.

‘ According to campus police, the

student was walking past the cor-
ner of Sutherland Drive and
Allequippa Street at 5 p.m. when
the 17-year-old and a companion
approached him. The two sus-

pects asked if he wanted to buy
some “stuff” and the student
declined. '

\Y/hen a friend of the victim
drove up and stopped, the 17-
year—old pulled out the BB hand-
gun, pointed it at them and said,
“You want some of this?” The sus-
pect then began striking the stu-
dent on his headlwith the gun
barrel.

A university security guard saw
the incident and radioed the carn-
pus police who arrived to find the

J

suspects walking down Darmgh
Street. The suspects began to run,
and the officers followed and
stopped them between stadium
gates three and five where the
youth pulled the gun on the offi-
cers.

After a short stmggle, the sus-
pect dropped the gun and the offi-
cers arrested him and his 21-year-
old companion, neither of whom
is al’riliated with the university.

The annual Heinz Chapel
Choir Christmas Concert will
be very different this year, but
still traditional in the Christmas
spirit.

This year the candlelight per-
formance will be carols from a
variety of international places.
The a Cappel/a choir will be
singing carols from Mexico,
Czechoslovakia, Hawaii, Korea,
the Ukraine and songs dating
back to Medieval times.

The international theme was
not intentionally planned for
this year, said John Goldsmith,

‘director of the ‘choir for four

years. ,
“It just sort of happened," he

1 ‘said. "I found all this beautiful
_ A music.”

Christmas favorites are also
included in the concert, with

the-audience invited to sing

along during the program.
The choir will begin the con-

cert from the balcony, and
then will circle around the
chapel to sing carols by can-
dlelight. '.

Angel Hoyt, a sophomore in
the choir, will be singing a
solo in Spanish with Pitt music
professor Jim Ferla accompa-
nying on guitar.

Although the choir does not
use instruments, exceptions are
made occasionally for solos.

This year it is a guitar; last year

it was a harp.

“I’m pretty nervous because
the building is so big, but I’m
excited too. I’m really looking
forward to it,” Hoyt said. She
will be singing Joaquin
Rodrigo’s “Coplillas de Belen,”
which means “Carols of
Bethlehem.”

“Everyone should come,” she

C said. “It’s really worth it. It’s all

done in a cappella and it’s
really amazing.”

Art Start

gallery
moves to

warehouse
By Beth Kovaly

Asst. News Editor

A four-story warehouse
on Fifth Avenue stands
vacant —— except for this
weekend

The old Merchant’s Bank
Building, 1410 Fifth Ave.,
will be a showcase for
amateur artists. The show,
“A Tinder'Box,” includes
paintings, photography,
sculptures, installations,
performance and music as
Art Start puts on its second
show in Pittsburgh.

Art Start, a non-profit
organization, converts
vacant warehouses into
non-traditional gallery set-
tings for local and regional
artists. ‘

Jennifer Swan, Pitt stu-
dent and one of the orga-

. nizers for the event,
stressed the opportunity
for amateur artists to show
their work. 0

“A lot of professional
galleries won’t display
amateur artists,” Swan said.
“This is a place where peo-
ple who aren’t necessarily
professional artists can dis-
play their art.”

Pitt student Mark
Ingraham, also an Art Start
organizer, said the ware-
house space‘was donated
for the show.

“There’s been a big
response in Pittsburgh, to
what’s going on,”
Ingraham said. “We’ve had
a lot of support from the
art community.”

Art Start targets areas
needing positive energy to
combat violence and
drugs, according to
Ingraham. The first show,

. held in the Pittsburgh Soho
area, brought local com-
munity interest and expo-
sure for young artists,

Ingraham said.

Featuring over 150
pieces from over 30
regional artists the show
will ramble throughout the
four stories of the ware-
house. A jazz band will
also be playing on one of
the ﬂoors.

The show opens this
Friday, Dec. 4 from 7:30-
until 10:30 p.m. It will also
be open throughout the
weekend from noon until‘
5 p.m.

 

Lothrop Hall RAs get

Staﬂ Writer

Whipped cream pies ﬂew at
Lothrop Hal1’s resident assistants
Tuesday night as part of the
Lothrop Challenge, a fund-rais-
ing contest sponsored by the
Lothrop Hall Resident Student
Association.

“We haven’t had any other
fund-raisers this semester
because we’ve put all our efforts
and energies into this,” Lothrop
RSA President Floyd Thoma
said. “Most RAs do it because it’s
for charity.”

Fifth ﬂoor senior RA Debra
Aisenstein, who was the first
“victim” in the activity, agreed
with Thoma’s statement and
admitted residents’ willingness
to take part in the event. “I
know there are a lot of residents
who can’t wait to do this. I don’t
think I am [a tough RA], but I
think some of the residents do,”
she said.

Telescope once again
protested by SEAC

By David Weimer
Staff Writer

Pitt’s Student Environ-men-
tal Action Coalition (SEAC)
will “rufﬂe some feathers”
today when they stage a
protest against the university’s
possible involvement with the
Mount Graham International
Observatory in Arizona.

Matt Peters, an SEAC repre-
sentative, said that the rufﬂing
event will begin at 11 a.m. at
the Cathedral fountain, and

‘ the media has been invited by

the environmental group to a
press conference beginning at
noon. Peters said his organi-
zation has already contacted
radio and television-stations
including KDKA and WTAE,
as well as local newspapers
In Pittsburgh and The City
Paper.

Olivia Kissel, press corre-
spondent for SEAC, said there

are definite goals the group
hopes to achieve through the
protest.

“Our short-term goal is to
get an audience with
[Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor]; we have people
who can come in from
Arizona who are knowledge-
able about the [telescope] pro-
ject itself, the plans that the
University of Arizona has for
the project and the [American-
Indian] people out there who
are opposing it,” Kissel said.
“We think that [observatories]
are vital and they are impor-
tant, but not at this site.”

She said that O’Connor had ’
previously agreed to talk with
people who oppose Pitt’s
involvement after speaking to
a Greenpeace member during
SEAC’s “sleep-in” vigil on the
William Pitt Union lawn Oct.
12.

Schott down

“We got rid of that trouble-making nigger,” said Marge
~ “Adolph” Schott owner of both the Cincinnati Reds and
an old Nazi arm band.

That’s right ladies and gentlemen. The great old
American pastime, upon which heroes have been made,
legends immortalized and classic literature written, is at _it
again. Only this time Major League baseball is showing

. its dark side and the growing list of embarrassments with

which it has come to be associated.

Mom, baseball and apple. pie ——- the most American
things known to humankind. It’s only appropriate that
baseball should find itself grouped among the other two.
Mothers find themselves getting very little help, apples
sprayed with insecticides are found to be carcinogenic,
and baseball is going down the toilet. S

It seems as if almost every Major League baseball sea-
son’ is embroiled in controversy before it even starts. First
it was Dodger General Manager Al Campanis, who was
removed from his job for making racial remarks, then it
,was Pete Rose for gambling, then George Steinbrenner
for shady business deals and now Cincinnati Reds owner
Marge Schott for extremely damaging racial remarks,
such as “Jew bastards” and “million-dollar niggers.”

An investigation, which included the two league presi-
dents, has begun to find out the degree of Schott’s mali-
cious racial and ethnic comments. If the commission
finds the allegations against her not to be in the ‘best
interests of baseball, then it can suspend her.

Just to make a small prediction about this possibility of
suspension the ACLU can’t even find a reason to support
her.

To set the record straight though, regardless of how
ruthless Schott’s comments were, we do not  she
should besuspended or removed from baseball solely
because of the comments she made. As a matter of fact,
the comments made by Schott are not even the issue.
Marge Schott, just like everyone else in this country, has
the right to be a racist if that is what she pleases.

The real problem is that as an employer in a joint enter-
prise such as baseball her remarks not only hurt the sport
on moral grounds but pragmatic ones as well. Baseball is
outside the normal “competitive” practices that much of
corporate America faces. Collusion is very much a part of

the successes of this sport. No team can sell a team with-

out majority consent, and many decisions are taken mul-
tilaterally. Therefore, the actions of Schott could have
very deep implications — in terms of its financial posi-
tion as well as its moral standards — for the rest of the
league owners.

— If Major League baseball finds the allegations aimed at
Schott to be accurate, then it should take whatever puni-

.tive actions are necessary to suspend her. It’s done so

with everybody else involved; it should do so with its

CRs ignorant about homosexuality

Eric Lurie, head of public
relations for College Repub-
licans, says that “... the cur-
rent Department of Defense
policy. [banning gays and les-
bians from the military] is not
discriminatory because homo-
sexuality is a chosen type of
lifestyle.” (The Pitt News, Nov.
24) CR’s position on this is
most queer, indeed, because
it is in contradiction with the
DOD’s own construal of
homosexuality; the DOD
ejects gay personnel for iden-
tity, not for behavior. In the
most famous case of Joseph
Steffan, would-be graduate of

Annapolis Naval Academy
(written about in The Pitt
Nezvs, Nov. 17), a battalion
commander was ejected only

 

for saying he was gay, not for
any punishable behaviors. On
the flipside, military policies
allow for male personnel
“caught in the act” of gay sex

to be retained if they will B

deny being homosexual and
rationalize that they were
influenced by the unavailabil-
ity of women. The policies
are not against acts, they are
against gay identity and the
affirmation of it.

The idea that homosexuali-
ty is a “chosen” desire is too
ridiculous for comment. And
as for “chosen  lifestyle,”
the only such choice lesbians,
gays and bisexuals have is to
either be yourself or hate
yourself.

I. Casey/The Pitt Nes

Junior center Eric Mobley had a strong game inside against St. Francis.

By Cory Vvalborn
Senior Staff Writer

A missed three-pointer, a nice
layup, another missed shot and a
beautiful perimeter jumper. Rerun
this cycle for 40 minutes, add the
jitters of opening night and the
score says Pitt 89, St. Francis 75.

This up-and—down performance
was what the 5,489 in attendance
witnessed as an over—matched St.
Francis squad could only shoot
from three—point land while it
watched a taller, bigger, stronger
Pitt team take control.

“We played a little tentative, a
little passive,” St. Francis head
coach Tom McConnell said. “Pitt
was ‘too much inside. We played

for a while, but they were so"

wide, so physical, they wore us
down.”

But from the first tip off of the
season at Fitzgerald Field House,
the Panthers were not wearing
anyone down. They were incon-
sistent.

“We played well in spots,”
Panther head coach Paul Evans
said. “Then we played poorly in
others.” .

“In the first half we were up
and down,” Panther guard Jeny
McCullough said. “We missed a
lot of shots.”

McCullough then took it upon
himself to lead Pitt in the second
half. The sophomore guard
scored 17 points in the game, but
his seven-in—a—row ‘sparked a sec-
ond—half surge that ignited Pitt to
its first “\Y/“’ of the season.

“McCullough was a bright spot,”
Evans said. “He was in control
most of the time. I was pleased
with his play.”

“It was time to take over the
game,” McCullough said. “It was
all hustle to get everybody into it.”

Getting his team “into it,”
McCullough saw the results.
Fellow guard Ahmad Shareef was
just plain powerful. His 10 points
on silky-smooth jumpers and
rock-solid defense showed that he

is confident in his talents.

“Ahmad’s been playing really
well in practice,” Evans said of’
Shareefs outside-perimeter shoot-
ing. ‘ _ ‘

While Shareefs conﬁdent shoot-
ing was helping Pitt’s needy out-
side game, Panther forward,
Antoine Jones, back after a year
off, was very powerful. His two
massive dunks showed that he is
back stronger than ever.

Pitt, which ﬂirted with the Red
Flash in the first half, maintained
an average lead of 10 points. St.
Francis only managed to stay
close with excellent three—point
shooting from guard Bryan
Gandee.

Wanting‘ to watch all the players
he could, Evans used 12 Panthers
throughout the game. In a first-
half dominated by the usual first-
game errors, Pitt used its muscle
advantage and plugged away at
St. Francis. At half, the Panthers
held a 38-29 advantage with

Committee approves three
football Coaching options

By Rob Pugliese
and Brian Berger
T be Pitt News

Three high-profile candi-
dates for Pitt’s head football
coaching job have been
approved by the Screening
and Advisory Committee,
according to WPXI—TV.

As reported on the 5250
p.111. and 11 p.111. newscasts
last night, former Pitt head
coaches Jackie Sherrill,
Johnny Majors and
Louisville head man
Howard Schnellenberger
are the three. Sherrill, the
head coach for nationally-
ranked Mississippi State,
came to Pittsburgh within
the last 24 hours to meet
with Pitt officials and has
apparently emerged as the
leading choice.

Sherrill coached Pitt from
1977 to 1981 and compiled
the finest winning percent-
age in school history (.842),
going 50-9-1. In Sherrill’s
five-year reign of glory, Pitt
finished among both AP
and UPI’s Top 10 four
times, including back-to-
back number—two UPI rank-
ings in 1980 and 1981. The

‘Panthers also won four of
five bowl appearances.

Majors, who was forced
out of his job at Tennessee

_previously brought

three weeks ago, came to
town Tuesday in a
University of Tennessee air-
plane and appears to be
Pitt’s second choice.

Majors guided Pitt to the
National Championship in
1976 and then bolted for
Tennessee the following
season. He left Pitt with a
recordof 33-134, for a .714
winning percentage that
ranked him fourth on the
Panthers’ all-time list.

Schnellenberger, fresh off ’

a 5-6 season at Louisville,
has also been confirmed
as a candidate. Schnel-
lenberger’sCardinals
whipped Pitt 31-16 at Pitt
Stadium on Nov. 14. Inside
reports indicated that this
lopsided loss was the
deciding factor in Paul
Hackett’s dismissal as head
coach.

Schnellenberger has
turned the Louisville pro-
gram around since his
arrival in 1985, leading the
Cards to the 1991 Fiesta
Bowl with a 9-1-1 mark. He

gram out of the shadows

up-tempo attack

By Brian Gallagher

Sports Assistant

Ice on the dribble-drive,
Ahmad knockin’ down the
baseline “J5” and
Daddy” shaking the Field
House irons.

Though Pitt’s_ 89-75
blowout of an undersized

St. Francis squad looked

more like an official scrim-
mage than a legitimate sea-
,son—opener — more substi-

tutions than a hockey
game — glimmers of the
spectacular up—tempo

Panthers’ attack were in

ample supply.

Whether it was the
impressive dunk exhibition
by center Eric Mobley or
the dish—and-bomb antics
of guards Jerry McCullough
and Ahmad Shareef lead-
ing the attack, the 1992-93
version of Pitt basketball

-was in full force at
Fitzgerald Field House last
night.

Playing his first regular
season game as the floor
general of the Pitt offense

and replacing departed Pitt ‘

guard Sean Miller,
McCullough led the team
in scoring with 17 points
on seven—of-12 shooting.
Along with running the
Panthers’ offense, “Ice”
showed his stuff on the
defensive end —— shadow-
ing an array of Red Flash
point guards in his game-
high 33 minutes of action.
For Pitt head coach Paul
E-vans, top honors in the

sometimes—sporadic Pitt .

sprintfest was McCullough.
The seventh—year coach of
the Panthers was especially
pleased with his point
guard’s control and intensi-
ty on both ends of the
court.

“I thought he was the
bright spot ltonightl,”
Evans said. “He was in
control most of the time. I
was pleased with his play.”

While Evans was pleased
with McCullough’s control
of the Pitt offense, “Ice”
took to heart his coaches’
promise before the season

Panther men swirn and dive into Pitt Invitational

By Josh Roth

Staff Writer

This weekend the Pitt Men’s
swimming and diving team will
host the seventh annual Pitt
Invitational meet at Trees Pool.

The University of

Pitt volleyball
1/z'sz'l;9 Stanford
in NCAA ’5

By Cory Walborn
Senior Staff Writer

The California sun, a gold— ’

en-brown tan, a nice, white
sand beach and volleyball.
What a perfect daydream‘ for
these snowy December days
in Pittsburgh.

For the Pitt volleyball team
it is time to wake u.p
because this is no daydream,
it is reality. The Panthers are
pitted against the second—
ranked Stanford Cardinals in
the first round of the NCAA
tournament this Friday and
should welcome the warmth
rolling off the Pacific Ocean.

Travelling west to meet the
powerful Cardinals is also a
homecoming for Pitt head
coach Sue Woodstra.
Woodstra, born and raised in
California, attended Southern
Cal and was an All-American
star for its undefeated 1977
national championship team.

This trip might just be a
case of survival for the
young Pitt volleyball squad.

“Realistically our chances
are pretty slim,” Woodstra
said of the possibility of the
shocking upset. “Everybody
will have to play way above
everything we have done in
the past [to have a chance of
winning].”

Playing Stanford (26-2), a
team that only lost two
matches the entire season
(both to top—ranked UCLA),

will not be easy for the-

Panthers (.18-13) and the
player—to-player match-ups
will not be in Pitt’s favor.
Pitt’s top players, outside
hitter Ann Marie Lucanie and
setter Annie Me‘=1'~‘r-it1‘gl1,""“'will
equal things out at those two
vital positions. But it is in
the middle where the
Panthers will fall short.

.Playing first—year players

Alyssia Yanik and Sarah
Mikla, Pitt has no one close
to Stanford’s A1l—American
middle hitter Bev Oden.

“Bev Oden —— now there’s
a talent,” Woodstra said.
“She was the last person to
be cut from the U.S. Olympic
team.”

Oden, a senior, has plenty
of experience and should
give the Cardinals a tremen-

dous advantage. Pitt’s Yanik '

and Mikla are just not in the
same class as Oden.
Woodstra said that setter
Kari Wendell was another
player to watch on the
Cardinal roster. Woodstra
also said Stanford has the

advantage off the bench.

Panther women's swim,
dive hosts Invitational

By Matt Silverman
For The Pitt News

The seventh annual Pitt
Invitational begins tonight at
Trees Pool as the Lady
Panthers host the University
of Maryland, Miami (OH),
Virginia Tech and the
University of Connecticut in
the three day meet.

After a two—and—a-half-
week layoff, Pitt is looking to
set the tone for the second
half of the swimming and
diving season with victories
over this eclectic group of
opponents.

The University of Maryland
brings in a small team with
only 13 swimmers and one
diver. The Terp’s top swim-
mer is sophomore Christina
Burch, who is seeded first in
the 50- and the 100-yard
freestyle events. —

Virginia Tech brings in a
program that is in its final
year of representation, as
Tech will cut women’s
swimming and diving pro-
grams from its varsity sports
slate next year..

The Panthers defeated the

Hokies in a dual meet three
weeks ago.

UConn brings in a program
that is on the rise in the Big
East.

Led by senior captain
Jennifer Lyons, who is
seeded in the top three in
several events, the Huskies
are looking to compete
strongly in the same pool
where the Big East
Championships will be held
in just over 12 weeks.

Pitt women’s swimming
head coach David Belowich
said that Miami (OH) is the
“team to beat” in this meet.

The Redskins bring in a
large team (26 swimmers
and two divers) and are on
the outskirts of a top—20
ranking.

They are seeded first in
three of the five relay events
and have six first—place seeds
in the 13 individual events.

With a 2-2 record in dual
meet competition this season,
the Panthers would like to
take advantage of the cham-
pionship style format that

Staff Writer

The Pitt Panthers are on their
way to Honolulu to play the
Rainbows of the University of
Hawaii this Saturday.

The Rainbows are the most
obscure top-25 team in the
country, currently ranked 25 in
some college football polls.

Preseason polls predicted
Hawaii would be near the bot-
tom of the Western Athletic
Conference, so the Rainbows
pulled a big surprise by coming
into the game with Pitt sporting
a 9-2 record. That is even more
of a shock considering the
Rainbows lost one of their best
players, junior split back Jeff
Sydner, who departed one year
early to take a crack at the NFL.

Hawaii has beaten some for-
midable teams this year, includ-
ing Brigham Young and
Colorado State. Also, the
Rainbows have not lost at
home yet this season and have
averaged over 44,000 fans per
game this year.

Rainbow head coach Bob
Wagner is in his sixth season at
the Hawaii helm. He served as
an assistant coach the previous
nine years before that. His
overall record at Hawaii is 43-
27-2.

The Rainbows are considered
to be a small team by Division
I standards, but they more than
make up for their size with

I

‘®

their excellent team speed.
Their forté on offense is run-
ning out of the option, but
starting quarterback Michael
Carter is just as adept at step-
ping back and throwing when
need be. Carter has run for 508
yards and 10 scores and has
thrown for 715 yards and five
touchdowns

Carter’s main weapon is
handing off (or pitching) the
ball to running back Travis
Sims, who has run for 1,375
yards and eight touchdowns.
This one-two punch has the
ability to wreak havoc on an
opposing defense.

“We have to control these
two guys to have an opportuni-
ty to win,” said Sal Sunseri, Pitt
interim head coach. “We are
going to have to stop their full-
back.”

Hawaii’s main offensive
weapon is placekicker/punter
Jason Elam. He was a presea-
son All-American as well as a
member of Playboys All-
American team and Kodak’s
All-American team.

“[Elam] is a real weapon,”
Sunseri said. “He has kicked a
55-yard field goal this season.
So our defense will really have
to try and hold back their
offense.”

Hawaii is not all offense
either. It plays very tenacious
on defense and has led the
WAC conference in defense

THE PIIT.,N1*ZWS, Thursday, December 3, 1992

jomfcm, Pippen lead charge  imaginczify NBA two-on-two show

By Stephen Liss
and Rob Pugliese

The Pitt News

For some unfortunate fans, the
novelty of the National Basketball
Association’s 1992-93 season has
already started to wear off. \Vrth
the season just five weeks old,
Michael Jordan’s incredible 40-
point performances, Tim
Hardaway’s nasty cross—over drib-
blesand Karl Malone’s spectacu-

A lar post-up moves are becoming

such regular OCCUITCIICCS that the

casual pro-hoop fans are quickly

turning their attentions toward
1 less deserving pastimes.

In order to help dispel this sud-
den loss of interest, we’ve decid-
ed to elaborate on a great idea
that Street 6- Sm-itl9’s Magazine
dabbled with in its 1992-93 NBA
preview. The article hints that
instead of the usual slam-dunk
and three—point contests, the NBA
should schedule a two—on—two
tournament highlighting All—Star
Weekend in February.

We got so excited over the

S potential match—ups of this hypo-

thetical event that we spent hours
speculating which teams would
send which players and who
would win. Here’s our synopsis:

Chicago Bulls:

Hands down, the Bulls would
be an odds on favorite to win the
whole thing. Because Michael
Jordan and Scottie Pippen are so
versatile, other teams would need
to choose tanderns to match up
with these two, rather than send-
ing their best two players. These
two studs easily set the tone.
They do have one weakness —
no post defense —-— which certain
teams will be able to exploit.
Odds: 1-1

Atlanta Hawks:

Dominique Wilkins is as good
as anyone when it comes to cre-
ating a shot. He’s a threat from
outside of 15 feet, but you can’t
chase him out there or you’ll be
reading the advertisement on the
back of his shoes. Match him up
with this year’s probable rebound
champion Kevin Willis, and
you’ve got a squad every bit as
good as the Pippen/Jordan duo.
Odds: 2-1

9"”/.

Charlotte Hornets:

Larry Johnson’s a no-brainer,
but who do you send with him?
If you send Alonzo, who handles
the ball? Mugsy Bogues? No way!
He might be able to dish to
Johnson, but the other teams
would post him up and score at
will. Our choice is a healthy
Kendall Gill. He can score, dish
to the big man, and at 6 feet, 5
inches he’s got the right build to
guard some of the elite point
men, including Mr. Chicago.
Odds: 10-1

Cleveland Cavaliers:

We had a lot of fun with this
team. The best two players on
the Cavs are Mark Price and Brad
Daugherty. But two—on—two is a
different game. Price couldn’t
guard a guy like Jordan or even
Gill’. The nod goes to Gerald
Wilkins. He can create his own
shot while providing the “D” to
stopany backcourt player in the
NBA. Daugherty is also a premier
scorer, but his defensive skills are
suspect, and his jump shot is
mud outside of the paint. Send
Wilkins with defensive giant Larry

Nance and you’ve got a squad
that can fill the hole from any-
where on the court while provid-
ing impenetrable defense. Odds:
8-1

Dallas Mavericks:

The Mavs could send ﬁve play-
ers and still lose. But if you had
to pick, and we did, send Derek
Harper and Terry Davis. Odds:
1,000-1

Denver Nuggets:

Chris Jackson and Dikembe
Mutombo. Jackson can stick the
“3” while Mutombo cleans up the
slop underneath. That’s if they
played Davis and Harper.
Otherwise this weak tandem
would get toasted by most of the
other teams. Odds: 60-1

Detroit Pistons:

Joe Dumars is the point man
and along with Olden Polynice.
Rodman can’t score, Woolridge
can’t.play defense and Aguin‘e’s
over the hill. Odds: 300-1

Golden State Warriors:

If they had to chose two, the
Warriors would have to make a
few decisions. If they went with
pure scoring it’d be a no-brainer

with Chris Mullin and Tim
Hardaway. They wouldn’t play
any defense, but once they got
their hands on the rock they’d
never miss. Mullin and Billy
Owens is a better combination.
Owens can play big men while
the nimble Mullin plays point and
shoots the eyes out of the sucker
guarding him. Odds: 20-1

Houston Rockets:

The Rockets can offer a com-
petitive duo with Kenny Smith
and Hakeem Olajuwon, but don’t
expect them to take home any
trophies. Odds: 20-1

Indiana Pacers:

Reggie Miller and Detlef
Schrempf are a pretty solid
squad. Miller can drive, shoot
and defend while Schrempf rips
down rebounds. But Pippen
would have his way with the
sloth—like sixth man. Odds: 38-1

four of the past five years.

The Rainbows play a 4-3
style defense, and even though
they lost seven starters from
last year’s defense, they had
plenty of players ready to pick
up the slack.

Their top defensive players
are lineman Maa Tanuvasa (72
tackles, four sacks), defensive
back Carlos Anderson, inside
linebacker Louis Randall (62
tackles) and free safety Bryan
Addison (team—high 74 tackles
and four interceptions).

In this first—ever meeting
between Hawaii and Pitt, look
for the ‘Bows to play a fast-
paced game on offense where
they try to keep the Panther
defense on the field. This tactic
is especially effective because
most teams are not used to
playing in the Hawaiian heat.
This may be the one reason
why the Rainbows are unde-
feated at home.

On defense, expect Hawaii to
rely a great deal on pursuit.

“JMU swam real well against
us earlier, so I expect them to
swim well this weekend as

.well,” Amato said. “And from

what I’ve heard, Connecticut
has a good team this year.
There are really a number of
good swimmers on each team.
This meet will give us a chance
to use our depth.”

The Panthers hope to use this
meet as a chance to improve on
their times going into the rest of
the year and possibly meet
some NCAA-qualifying times.

“We have some young guys
who are really swimming better

’ right now than they ever have

in their lives,” Amato said. “We
have a few guys right now who
really could make the NCAA
times this weekend. We should
really see some fast swimming
this weekend, and if we happen
to get some NCAA times, OK.
These guys really get pumped-
up for a meet like this.”

The Pitt Invitational will start
Thursday night at 7 and will run
through Saturday evening with

the finals starting at 6:30.

“They have very good
depth,” Woodstra said
about the solid play of
Stanford’s bench.

That depth is something
Pitt does not have the lux-
ury of. When Pitt goes to
its second team the talent
level drops off consider-
ably in comparison to
Stanford.

But even with the talent
drop-off, Stanford head
coach Don Shaw is still
wary of the Panthers.

“It’s supposed to be a
mismatch,” Shaw said. “It’s
a match we’re supposed to
win. But l[Pittl has
absolutely nothing to lose.
You just never know.”

Looking only at the sta-
tistics, Shaw said that
Lucanie seems to be the
Panthers’ best player. But
he also said he will do
nothing to change his
Cardinals’ game plan.

“We are going to play

our game,” Shaw said. “We
will make adjustments as
the match progresses.”

Competing in the first
round of the NCAA tourna-
ment is nothing new to
Woodstra and her Pan-
thers.

In 1990, Pitt won its first
match ever in the NCAA
tournament by defeating
Ohio State.

But Pitt fell on hard luck
as it was demolished by

volleyball powerhouse

Nebraska in the second
round.

Last year, Ohio State
took revenge on Pitt and
quickly eliminated the
Panthers in round one.

Coming off that loss and
the loss of six seniors, it is
a surprise that Woodstra
has her team back into the
“big show.”

Even though the odds
are against Pitt to get to
the second round,
Woodstra is still upbeat.

“It’s a good experience,”
Woodstra said of the
upcoming Stanford match.
“We will hopefully learn
some things.”

While learning some
things out in California,
Woodstra will also get to
see some friends.

“My family may come up
[to Stanfordl,” Woodstra
said. “It will be nice to see
some people.”

One person Woodstra
will see is her long-time
friend Shaw.

“We coached at the Pan-
Am games together,” Shaw
said of his friendship with
Woodstra. “She is a great
person and a great coach; I
respect her a lot.”

Whether it will be a
learning experience or a
chance to see old friends,
the opportunity to ‘travel to
the West Coast will be a
welcomed break for a suc-

cessful season —— definitely

a daydream.

Shareefs 11 points and forward
Chris McNeal’s 12 points showing
the way.

The more-insp‘ired second half
started with McCullough grabbing
an inside rebound and laying it in.

He then turned around on the

Panthers’ next possession and
iced a three-pointer. Before the
Flash knew what hit them,
McCullough had stolen the ball
again for an easy two.

Starting his own seven-point
rally, Pitt continued to dominate
as more players got in on the act.
Junior center Eric Mobley scored
eight points as he hung once
again from the Field House n'ms.
Mobley also made three—out-of-
four free throws with a much-
improved softer shot.

“I took my time on my free-
throw shots,” Mobley said of the
secret to his early success from
the line.

First-year players Garrick
Thomas and JC transfer Marlon
Rhymes showed promise in the
game. While only scoring a total
of 11 points between them, both

that the Panthers’ “O” would
open up and let McCullough
do what he does best — cre-
ate. He showed that ability
particularly well in the sec-
ond half, when Pitt turned a
palatable lead into a laugher
midway through the half.

“I thought it was time to
take over the game —
encourage the team with
defense first,” McCullough
said. “That’s why I came out
with all hustle.

“There are more options
taking the ball to the hole.
You can pass, foul, score. [It]

defense. In the second half, I
felt we ran the ball well.”

Providing McCullough with
a potent foil at off guard was
the rangy _Shareef. In his 22
minutes of action, the junior
from Chicago rang up 10
points On four outside rain-
bows and an inside putback
of a missed shot.

While Shareef only shot
five-for-13 from the field,
Evans said he was pleased
with what he saw from his
starting off guard.

“Ahmad’s been playing real
well in practice lately,” Evans
said. “He was a little tight
[tonight], but I think as he

loosens up you’re going to
see him [get better].

“Most of the shots he did
make were perimeter shots.”

While Shareef ranged from
the outside, one Panther who
bowled and rolled on the
inside was Mobley. Though
not starting (because he
missed practice for class) but
playing just 15 minutes, “E”
was an intimidating force —
tallying 11 points on three
dunks and an improved
three-of-four performance at
the foul line.

While Mobley didn’t see
many passes come his way

racing and diving repre-
sents.

The usual Big East and
NCAA standards allow
swimmers to race in a
total of seven events, but
only three of these can be
individual races.

With an open format,
coaches in this invitational
can race swimmers in as
many events that they
choose enabling them to
find the individual swim-
mers’ best events.

“Virtually every one of
my swimmers is swimming

in at least four events,”

Belowich said. “Some of
my swimmers are swim-
ming in up to six different
events.”

Besides getting a good
look at his swimmers,
Belowich said he will also
look at this weekend as an
opportunity for his team
to find itself competitively.

“It is a chance for this
team, being as young as it
is, to define themselves as
winners. I would not be
surprised if a lot of best
times come out of this
meet,” Belowich said.

With five top seeds in
the individual events and
two in the team events
and 11 individuals seeded
fifth or better among the
individual races, expecta-
tions are high for success

, this weekend.

First-year swimmer Jill
Fletcher, who tops the
rankings of both the
100- and 200—yard breast
stroke for this meet, said
that this weekend will
give Pitt the opportunity
to race its fastest
races until the Big East
Championship.

“I think this is a very
good chance to see what
it is like in a Big East—type
of meet,” Fletcher said,
adding that she and the
other first—year swimmers
are looking to see what
they are made of under

situations where they are
expected to win.

“Being seeded first gives
you confidence, but
it also puts pressure on
you since being ranked
second or third would
give you room to move up
and surprise,” Fletcher
said.

Belowich will look at
this weekend as a gage of
his team’s potential for the
rest of the season.

“This meet has a lot of
influence and a lot of
learning for me about the
rookie swimmers,”
Belowich said.

He said that this week-
end he hopes to success-
fully measure how well
his team has meshed
together the experienced
with the unexperienced
swimmers.

“The collective chem-
istry on the team is very
good, and I think that that
is going ‘to manifest itself
into good performances
this weekend,” Belowich
said.

In the diving competi-
tion, Panther Coach Julian
Krug says that this week-
end’s field‘ will provide
competition for his divers,
but that this meet pales in
comparison in importance
to the Big East and NCAA
Championships at the end
of the season.

Nevertheless, the
expanded format of the
diving events will allow
each diver to dive more
times and to experiment
with more difficult dives.

The competition begins
tonight at Trees Pool at
7:00 p.m. with the timed
finals.

On Friday and Saturday
the preliminaries will be at
10 a.m., followed by the
the finals at 6:30 p.m. The
diving commences one
hour after the preliminar-
ies.

be Sedale Threatt at the point
with Vlade Divac in the post.
Divac isn’t close to being
among the better big men in a

, two-on—two showdown but
_ he’s a lot better than Perkins or
Worthy. Odds: 75-1

Miami Heat:

In a five—on-five game
Ronnie Seikaly is a stiff. In a
two-on-two gig he’s not a bad
tool to have down low. We
pair him up with Glenn Rice.
Odds: 32-1

Milwaukee Bucks:

The Bucks don’t pose a

major threat at guard or up

front. They do possess one of
the best defensive players in
the NBA with Alvin Robertson,
but he can’t score as well as
Blue _Edwards. Whatever
match-up they send won’t rnat-
ter, but we chose Robertson
and Mr. Softie Frank
Brickowski. Odds: 900-1

Minnesota Timberwolves:

Chuck Person and Christian
Laettner. Odds: 60-1

New Jersey Nets:

Derrick Coleman combines
the ability to fill it up with the
tenacity to guard even the
craftiest big men. He’d get
schooled by an Olajuwon or
Ewing, but he’s a better choice
than center/stiff Sam Bowie.
Team him with Drazen

Petrovic. Odds: 40-1

New York Knicks:

The Knicks have a. great 12-
man team — by far the deepest
in the league, but a two-man
squad won’t do justice to one
of the greatest centers ever.
Patrick Ewing and Rolando
Blackman are our choices. Ro
can guard Jordan while Ewing
takes Pippen to school. Odds:
25-1

Orlando Magic:

A year ago Orlando would
have 1,000—1 odds, but a lottery
pick later they’re our favorite
couple. Nick Anderson,
the fleet-footed guard, can
score on ‘and defend any
backcourt player in the NBA.
Team him up with the one-
man gang Shaquille O’Neal and
you’ve got a winner. The Bulls
would need to send Jordan,
Pippen and Horace Grant just
to stop the Shaq down low.
Odds: 2-1 5

Philadelphia 76ers:

Hersey Hawkins and Arman
Gilliam. Odds: 150-1 ’

Phoenix Suns:

You could send a healthy
Kevin Johnson and Barkley,
but KJ‘ doesn’t have the girth to
play one—on-one “D.” Send
Dan Majerle. Thunder Dan can
control the offense and fill the
hole. Don’t miss against this
team, it’ll never give up a

rebound. Odds 3-1

Portland Trailblazers:

This is the only team that
could send two guards and be
very competitive. Terry Porter
and Clyde Drexler combine the
speed of a Spud Webb with
the strength of a Nick
Anderson. Odds 15-1

Sacramento Kings:

Mitch Richmond and Lionel
Simmons. Odds 45-1

San Antonio Spurs:

David Robinson and Sean
Elliot are a terrific twosome.
Odds 3-1

Seattle Supersonics:

Shawn Kemp and Gary
Payton. Kemp’s a mean beast
on the boards, but Payton’s too
streaky to do justice at the
guard spot. Odds 32-1

Utah Jazz:

Easy. Karl Malone and John .
Stockton. Hope Karl can draw
the double team on “O” and“
make up for-Stockton’s weak-5'
ness on “D.” Odds 9-1

Washington Bullets:

Pervis Ellison and Tom
Gugliotta. Pervis is one of the
league’s steadiest in the middle,
and Gugs can handle smoothly
for a big man. Odds 38-1

Jordan and Pippen run this
show, but Anderson and the
Shaq could be the ones cele-
brating back home in
Disneyland. ‘

Local Theater goes Ho-Ho-Ho

J Inspecting Carol spoofs Dickens classic

Holiday Memories fill

the

By Michelle Kleinsak
Staff Writer

Around the time when the
Salvation Army bell pierces the
air and Kaufmann’s acquires
more red sequins than any one
person could ever dream of
wearing, more conservative
regional theaters gear to churn
out their annual productions of
Charles Dickens’ A Christmas

' Carol. The classic, which has

always been a money-maker in
the leanest 0’ times, is the
foundation for Inspecting Carol,
an unlawfully funny spoof just
in time to ‘tis the season at the
Public Theater.

The play follows the format
of a play within a play; a con-
cept introducing us to the peo-
ple behind the scenes of a

vMidwest regional theater’s

annual rendition of the pre-
dictable A Cbrtstmas Carol. The
start is a bit slow, but that may
be because the plot needs time
to develop. Once it gets going,
the laughs hit you like consec-
utive blows to the gut, barely
giving you time to recover
before the next one comes at
ya. It’s the inability to predict
what’s going to happen next, in
an otherwise predictable situa-

T tion, that gives Inspecting Carol

D Christope C (L and avid Wolos-Fonteno star in Public Theater's Inspect Crol A

an edge over the run 0’ the
mill, sappy family values of in-
your—face Christmas melodra-
ma.

During rehearsals the audi-
ence meets a typical man_ic
crew of theater people. The
news is dropped that the

National Endowment for the

Arts is cutting the Playhouse’s
funding to nil. This, in addition
to the arrival of a stranger
whose dream is to act, and an
ensuing case of mistaken iden-
tity lay the base for the confu-
sion that follows. Add to that
an overbearing, politically cor-
rect famous actor and a neurot-
ic artistic director’ and you get
some pretty hilarious moments.
One of the best comic
moments is when aspiring actor
Wayne Wellacre desecrates a
Shakespearean monologue in
an audition that proves to be
sheer hell for the rest of the
troupe to watch. The rest of the
play is" filled with one—liners,
mostly with a healthy jab of
political innuendo, that result
when Wayne and Larry, the
famous actor, collaborate on a
reworking of the script. In their
revised version, the Cratchits
become a dysfunctional family,
and Scrooge is asked to ponder
how much‘ different life would

be if Mrs. Cratchit never gave
‘birth to the litter. This provides
an opportunity for some hits on
federal funding for abortion.

Another issue that arises is
the lack of multicultural com-
panies in the theater industry.
To please the NEA, a token
‘African-American actor is hired.
This highlights the color
boundaries and the token
minority business that exist in
relatively open artistic venues
like theater.

Director David Saint puts the
cast in excellent physical situa-
tions that maxirnize the sitcom
quality of the play. There is a
lot of physical comedy, but it
always remains fresh and never
becomes annoying. Alma
Cuervo brings the perfect insid-
er kind of knowledgeof stereo-

typical theater people to her

portrayal of Zorah Bloch, the
director. Christopher Curry

. does the same with his portray— V

al of prima donna actor Larry.
Inspecting Carol is a well-
needed look at the holidays
because it doesn’t take itself
too seriously the way most sea-

sonal shows, and people do at V

this time of year.

Inspecting‘ Carol runs through
Dec. 20 at the Pittsburgh Public
Theater.

City Theatre stage

. I av 

ing in City Theatre's Holiday Memories.
’ By Lori M. Bossert
Staff‘ Writer

Despite what the retailers and shopping malls would like
us to think, Christmas is a special season of love, wonder
and magic. If you’ve been having trouble believing this, I

. highly recommend seeing Holiday Memories, currently play-

ing at the City Theater on the South Side.

Holiday Memories, directed by Susan V. Booth, is a nos-
talgic look back at Christmas and Thanksgiving during the
early part of the century. Booth’s production has the feel of
an old Currier and Ives pr/int come to life -— not from elabo-
rate settings, costumes and effects, but from an incredible
sense of lo_ve'that underscores every line spoken. This play
has a lovely type of sentimentality that is everpresent, yet
never overpowering.

It’s actually a simple show. Four characters play out two
of Truman Capote’s autobiographical short stories of his
boyhood in 19305 rural Alabama. Adapted for the stage by
Russell Vandenbroucke, the stories have been kept fairly-
pure and uncut. Truman Capote (Jeremy Lawrence) and
Buddy (Capote’s younger self, played by Jim Hall) are on
stage for the entire show, taking turns narrating the two sto-
ries —- “The Thanksgiving Visitor” and “A Christmas

’Memory.”' The plot of both stories if focuses on

Capote/Buddy’s special childhood relationship with his
elderly cousin, Miss Sook (Ann B. Davis). Miss Sook is a
special individual — “She herself was not more than 12
years old mentally, which is what accounted for her purity,
timidity, her strange unexpected wisdom,” explains Buddy
early on. It is this mix of purity, wisdom and childlike won-
der that makes Holtday Memories the joyful experience it is.

All of the other characters in the two plays are performed

Dec. 6 at the David Lawrence
Auditorium. A local
“Lollapalooza” show will take
place as four local favorites
perform on the Pitt campus.
WPTS-FM (98.5), the University
of Pittsburgh’s student-run
radio station, and the Rainbow
Kitchen have put together a
lineup for a benefit concert to
aid the soup kitchen.

The bands, all well known in
the Pittsburgh music scene, will
take the stage at 5 p.m., and
the audience is encouraged to
bring non—perishable food
donations for a discount at the
door

Mike Ivan of WPTS was moti—
vated enough by his daily bus
ride to Pitt to organize the
event. “I caught my bus in
Homestead for two years,” he
said, “and I was pretty
depressed by‘ the situation. I
wanted to do something to
help the homeless and the
[Rainbow] Kitchen.”

The bands: Thin White Line,
Bad Genes and Pittsburgh’s

own “Three Amigos,” The Karl
Hendricks Trio, are all favorites
with the college crowd, as is
newcomers Wormhole, led by
Mary B. The show is open to
the public and those who bring
a food donation will receive a
$1 discount off of the ticket
cost.

“The bands were all eager to
do this show,” Ivan said, “They
all know about the homeless
situation.”

Thin White Line is a familiar
group to the Pittsburgh area,
they’ve been around for years,
expect the same good stuff
from them as in the past.

Bad Genes are Pittsburgh’s
answer to political rock, loud
punk style with lyrics that
count. Listen for them to play
“Rock the Boat” at the benefit.

And the one band that
doesn’t quite mesh with the
rest is the Karl Hendricks Trio,
this ultra—hip garage rock band
plays with an old-fashioned
good-time attitude.

There will also be informa-
tion booths for several universi-
ty affiliated organizations at the
event. All of the proceeds for
this event will benefit the
Rainbow Kitchen. WPTS is also
planning several concerts for
the upcoming semester.

Feel the local noise as W/PIS
throws a gig to benefit the

ARC ANGELS A

of the

Guide

trilogy

Douglas Adams
Mostly Harmless
Harmony Books

This book is called
“the fifth book in the
increasingly inaccurately
named Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy trilo-

The title, of course, is
from the first book in the
series by Adams. It is
what you would find if
you looked up ‘Earth’’ in
a copy of the fictional
computerized book The
Hitchhiker’s Guide to the
Galaxy.

For those who might
not understand this, a lit-
tle background is in
order.

The series was origi-
nally based on a radio
play in England. The
radio series was based
on an idea Adams had
when he was travelling
Europe and using The
Hitchhiker’s Guide to
Europe. It was later
made into a trilogy of
books: The Hitchhikers
‘Guide to the Galaxy, The
Restaurant at the End of
the Universe and Life, the
Universe and Everything.

. At some point in all this

it was a TV series on
BBC as well.

Later came the fourth
book in the series,
Goodbye and Thanks for
All the Fish.

The story begins with
the destruction of Earth
to make way for an inter-
spacial bypass. The hero
of the books, Earthling
Arthur Dent, is rescued
by a friend of his, Ford
Prefect. Unknown to
Arthur, Ford was not an
Earthling but a writer for
The Hitchhiker’s Guide to
the Galaxy who was
stuck on Earth while

. doing field research for

an entry on Earth. The
story follows Arthur and
his growing group of
associates on their
adventures through the

. galaxy, using the Guide

(thus the title of the first
book) to help them
along the way. The read-
er is helped as entries
from the Guide occasion-
ally appear in the text,
telling the reader about a
planet, alien race, etc.
The latest installment
starts in typical Guide
style, using typical Guide

Stone sounds like a furious combi-
nation of Frank Zappa and Henry
Cow-style arty prog-rock, sludgy
thrash metal like the Melvins and
downtown New York jazz improv.
As a result, Ruins has crafted a
highly-original style on wacky-titled
songs such as “Grubandgo,” “Zasca
Coska” and “Vexoprakta.”

The most amazing thing about
Ruins is how much it can do with
only two people. New bassist
Masuda Ryuichi entered the picture
via Sodo, the best reggae band on
the rural coast, but there’s no
Rastaman Vibrations here. His five-
stringbass adds top—end harmonics
to a brooding, driving bottom, all in
the space of each furious jam. And
if that’s not enough, Yoshida occa-
sionally inserts guitar fills, which
he's been known to play on his lap
while drumming, while singing
unintelligibly in a high, squeaky
voice.

Burning Stone is certain to end
up one of my favorite recordsof
the year. However, if you purchase
it and find that your thirst for Ruins
has not been slaked, try its first
Shimmydisc LP and the recently
released five-song 7-inch “on
Madison’s Public Bath label at your
local indie store. Ruins is infamous
for downing a bizarre blend of
beer, vodka, sake and wine coolers
while on tour, seemingly to no ill
effect. Let’s hope the group mixes
its drinks here sometime soon.

another omen of time-travel confusion
to come):

“The history of the Galaxy has got a
little muddled, for a number of rea-
sons: paitly because those who are try-
ing to keep track of it have got a little
muddled, but also because some very
muddling things have been happening
anyway. One of the problems has to
do with the speed of light and the diffi-
culties involved in trying to exceed it.
You can’t. Nothing travels faster than
the speed of light with the possible
exception of bad news, which obeys
its own special laws. The Hingefreel
people of Arkintooﬂe Minor did try to
build spaceships that were powered by
bad news, but they didn’t work partic-
ularly well and were so extremely
unwelcome whenever they arrived
anywhere that there wasn’t really any
point in being there.”

This book, like the fourth, is some-
what differentgfrom the first three. One
aspect I particularly noticed was the
use of cutting—edge theory and cyber-
punk—style technology. For example,
nanotechnology and virtual reality are
used, and one character has a ﬂexible
TV screen implanted in its wrist; It
‘seemed kind of jarring after the previ-
ous Ihumorously fictional pieces of
technology like the infinite improbabil—
ity drive and the bistromathics drive.

The plot was engrossing. It involved
Ford trying to solve the mystery of the
new ownership of the Guides publish-
ing company and the changes they
were implementing in the Guide.

Mostly Harmless is prefaced by the

pens. Anything that, in_happening,
causes something else to happen, caus-
es something else to happen. Anything
that, in happening, causes itself to hap-
pen again, happens again. It doesn’t
necessarily do it in chronological order,
though.”

This warns us that the story to come
is one of those time-loop, alternate-
reality, alternate-timeline type stories,
which, in fact, it is.

WARNING! SPOILER PARAGRAPH:
In this story we find Fenchurch has
disappeared from her seat on a space
ﬂight with Arthur, and no real reason is
given. Two Trillians exist: one in
space, (who has given birth to Arthur’s
daughter, Random, by getting his
sperm from a bank, at random) and
one on Earth — a newscaster, who
regrets not leaving Earth with the two-
headed spaceman that she met at a
party years before. Meanwhile, when-
ever Arthur tries to travel to Earth, it is
a totally different alien world each time
he arrives.

I won’t give away the ending except
to say I felt it was very unsatisfied, A
doubly so if this is going to be the last
book in the series.‘ Another sequel may
redeem it somewhat. « ,

One reason is that I foundthe
fourth book didn’t seem to be as bad
as I first thought when read back—to-
back with the first three books. So it
may seem with number five, if there
happens to be a sixth book. Which, if
it happens, may cause...

Japan used to be a land of
shrouded mystery, but now it’s just
a busy place where they make
VCRs faster and better than we do.
And as if it weren’t enough to dom-
inate the automobile and electron-
ics industries, now they’re also
making better tunes, vis-a-vis an
exploding underground music
scene.

If you’ve been living in a cave,
you probably didn’t hear about the
Boredoms, the Japanese group that
opened for Sonic Youth last month
at Metropol. The Boredoms is com-
prised of sufficient superstars to put
out its new CD on Warner Bros. in
Japan, but in the United States it is
still small potatoes, associated with
the N.Y.C. indie label Shimmydisc,
known for popularizing King
Missile and Bongwater.

Another Japanese band on
Shimmydisc is the bass/drums duo
Ruins, who has just released its sec-
ond stateside record, Burning
Stone. If you thought the Boredoms
was too spastic and thrashy, just
wait ‘til you hear Ruins — these
two guys channel more construc-
tively-controlled B.T.Us than the
luminous bituminous on the cover
can produce. ,

Ruins began when drummer
Tatsuya Yoshida wanted to start a
new group after his old outfit YBO2
broke up. I have one live Japanese
pressing by YBO2 where it tears

   Memories

Continued from page S-1
by two actors, one male and
one female (Thom Delventhal
and Patrice DeGraff-Arenas).
These strong, versatile perform-

V _ ers play everything from neigh-

borhood bullies to Buddy and
Sook’s stern, imposing

‘ iguardians. Each is given ample

chance to shine, especially
Delventhal as schoolyard bully
Odd, whom Sook invites to the
family Thanksgiving celebra-
tion.

Jeremy Lewis gives a fine
performance as Truman

Capote, the narrator of the

play. He blends gracefully with
Hal1’s Buddy, who is a pure
delight from beginning to end.
The two work together with
the ease and precision of a
vaudeville team together for
years, cross-blending their lines
and actions perfectly.

Ann B. Davis will surprise

theatergoers who can’t forget
her days as the “Brady
Bunch’s” housekeeper Alice.
Her portrayal of the simple,
sweet Miss Sook is natural and
convincing. She encompasses
both the childlike abandon

and ageless wisdom of the

character with grace and beau-
ty.
The set heightens the nostal-
gic qualities of this memory
play. The set is dominated by a
photo album featuring chang-
ing , images from
Truman/Buddy’s memory.
Scenic designer Tony Ferrieri
has created a look which is the
perfect complement and com-
ment upon the show. Likewise,
William O’Donnell’s lighting

‘bathes the actors in the warm,

golden light which colors our
happiest memories.

‘Holiday Memories is a lovely
show filled with simple wisdom

and deep feeling. Well worth
seeing, it is the sort of show
that reminds us what the true
meanings of the holiday season
are —— the spirit of love and
friendship which are hopefully
present in our lives all year
long.

Holiday Memories runs through D

Dec. 20 at the City Theater on
the South Side, and that means
fun for all. For instance, you
can get into the holiday mood
with a nostalgic chat with Ann

B. Davis after the performance ‘

on Sunday Dec. 13. Or, for the
college crowd, enjoy a two-for-
one discount on Dec. 8 and the
15. Also on the eighth is the
“Brady Bunch” loole—al-tlee day.
Yep, dress up as your favorite
Brady and win ticleets to the
City Theaters upcoming produc-
tion of the Baltimore Waltz. As
they say, it’s more fun than the
mall.
