ODK has really picked itself a Man of the Year in its award to John Vrana.

Probably more than any other single person, Vrana consolidated this year's stu-
dent leadership into ’a unit, not at a sacrifice of promoting success for individual organ-
izations, but along the philosophical lines that student leadership in general wants to be
recognized as responsible, that it wants its views considered by the administration, that
each, in its own area, Works for the same goal—the importance and the satisfaction of

the student body.

He carried on Marty Landy’s idea of the President’s Council more intensely, using
the diverse ideas of the representatives from each part of the student body—the Greeks,

-. . the housing units, men's and Women’s governing organizations, Student Union Board,
I " publications’——to arrive at projects to beneﬁt them as a whole.

The most immediate need was ﬁnancial, as it seemed to be throughout the Univers-

-L I ity, and for this reason. it was obvious to the student leaders that pressuring the ad-
" ‘ministration for a larger Student Affairs appropriation was a dead end. Vrana initiated

a , drive, therefore, to get student organizations funds from other sources—the proﬁts
from the 11) cards, the Book Center profits the pending Activities Fee—all of which not
only would give student activities more money but put the distribution of those funds in
the hands of the students themselves. ‘
, Vrana similarly pushed for Service Awards for qualiﬁed student leaders and draft-
ed operating rules for a Calendar Committee where the students co-ordinate their own

social calendar.

The 1965 ODK Man of the Year has set a precedent: he has made the position of
Student Government president one of leading the students as a whole, rather than merely
the head of another independent organization. He had truly earned the inscription on his

stone in the ODK walk.

I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR I

Student Wants
Carver Fired

Editor, The Pitt News:

In View of the current Univer-
sity program to slash unnecessary
costs from its budget, I would
suggest that Pitt should dispense
with the services of Frank Car-
ver, self-proclaimed hypocrite.

In the years since Mr. Carver
became athletic director the
sports teams at this school have
become a source of increasing
embarrassment for both students
and alumni. A quick look at the
performances of the winter sports
teams is enough to make any
reader of The Pitt News ignore
the sports" section entirely.

An athletic director’s job is to

provide the best possible players

and coaches, Under Carver’s ten-
ure, Pitt has not only retained
the services of a large number
of “nice guys” but also has failed
miserably in recruiting.

Major college athletics is a
business proposition and anyone
who doesn’t recognize this fact
has spent too much time at the
Carnegie Tech campus. A college
which wants to stay big-time in
athletics must recruit or else
have losing teams.

Mr. Carver’s daily excuse for
failures in recruiting has been
the high academic standards of

if " the school. What Mr. Carver fails

to understand is that Pitt must
engage’ in much more recruiting
because the standards of Pitt will
continue to increase in the com-
ing years,

But Mr. Carver is content to
go bumbling along in his unique
way and get athletes on a hit-or-
miss basis. Perhaps, Mr. Carver

. is too lazy to earn the salary

which Pitt so ch-aritably gives
him or else he is totally lack-

ing in the ability to do a capable.

job as athletic director of a ma-
jor university.

Pitt’s athletic program can
only be evaluated by the records

‘ V of its teams. Using this criterian

on Pitt doesn’t have much of an
athletic program and Mr. Carver
should be quickly ﬁred. If Mr.
Carver must remain with the
University, perhaps he and the
other “nice guys” in the Athletic
Department would be better suit-
‘ed to work in such an area as

 the Office of Student Records.

More Comment
On Cheating

Editor, The Pitt News:
There has been a -great deal

of confusion in the discussion of-

cheating in the University and I
believe that this is -because the
fundamental issues have been
overlooked, perhaps deliberately,
to avoid the hard thinking the
problem deserves, This is an at-
tempt to refocus the discussion
along fundamental lines_

The motivation to cheat, when
the student is insecure of his
prospective performance on an
examination, is clear. He wants
to pass the course so that, even-
tually, he will get a diploma and
the security of a job. Whether or
not he will be able to perform on
the job competently does not
matter to him while he is con-
fronted with the need to be
graduated from college.

Frequently the fact that there
is little relation between his per-
forrnance in certain courses 01
study and eventual performance
on the job because the courses
lack relevance and “on the job
training is generally recognized
as, standard procedure from the
point of view of employers. Nev-
ertheless college training ought
to be signiﬁcant and useful other-

wise it should be abandoned. The .

best way to prevent cheating is
not to moralize over codes of con-
duct (though this helps) and
harden the policing (which is
effective), but to remove the need
for cheating.

The problem lies in the fault
of the faculty in not formulating
a signiﬁcant course of study, not
specifying its objectives( or ter-
minal behavior) clearly, not con-
ducting a teaching procedure
which properly leads to these ob-
jectives, and not properly check-
ing continually the progress of
learning. '

If this analysis of. the problem
is correct, then a constructive ap-
proach would require the fac-
ulty to reconsider its activities
and solve a number of problems:
(a) Can the intellectual capacity,
knowledge, skills, and legitimate
goals of an individual college
student be accurately assessed?
(b) Can an individual course of
study be outlined for the student

 .- .-W-.- ...-..Libera.1..Arts ,’66  .mso...tbat...he..can...grovv..e&ectiizely

 .11

   

toward his goals? (c) Can a
teaching procedure be made
available so that the student can
maintain (or even increase) his
motivation, improve his know-
ledge and skills, and be made
continuously aware of his prog-
ress in learning through appro-
priate testing? If so, a ﬁnal ex-
amination would be little more
than a formality, if, indeed, it is
.at all necessary.

The proof of learning would
be a cummulative improvement

in performance in a course as .

obvious as the improvement in

performance on a musical in- '

strument one is‘ learning success-
fully to play. Occasional cheat-
ing on a campus is evidence of
a sick student, but widespread
cheating is evidence of a sick
institution. There is not cheating

in situations where there is ex- A

capable students who are aware
of their steady progress to sig-
niﬁcant goals,

Student Wishes

Stern Failure

Editor, The Pitt News:

People tend to get the govern-
ment that they deserve. Last
Wednesday, Pitt got the govern-
ment it richly deserves. The stu-
dent body elected a president
who was unable to even get a
running-mate, due to inertia, not
inability I presume, nor a party
to endorse him as heading its
slate. To lead their student gov-

.ernment, they chose a man who

hardly has the image of a nor-
mal Pitt student or of .a student
government president.

I myself have only two hopes.
One is that this mistake, farce
or abortion will not be repeated
in the future and that the parties
of the student government will
act in a rational, responsible
manner, that is as a check upon
presidential irresponsibility.

Meanwhile, we are stuck with
him for a year. I wish him all
possible failure, especially with
his plan to affiliate with NSA
and his desire to make a co-op of
the book store.

E y We A re Fight‘  g

- Second of a Series

In my last article I showed that it was false to claim
that we are defending freedom and democracy in Viet Nam
because South Viet Nam is neither free nor democratic. If
this is the case, we must be in Viet Nam for one of two
rea}s{ons: either our prestige or our national interest is at
sta e.

Now if _we say that only our prestige is at stake, then
we are admitting that we made a ‘mistake by getting in-
volved in Viet. Nam in the ﬁrst place. Because if we had not
become involved our prestige Would
not. be at stake. More important, if
our prestige is our only concern, in-
creasing our involvement is insane.
Rather our goal should be to with-
draw under circumstances ‘that in-
volve the minimum loss of prestige.

Thus the only justification for
our continued presence -in Viet Nam,
let alone an expansion of the war, is‘
that a victory for the Viet Cong
would be a serious blow to our na-
tional interest.

 

G 

FIRST WE MUST clearly deﬁne the proper objectives
of our foreign policy in Asia. Our primary aim is to prevent
China from achieving hegemony over the Asian continent.
This aim, however, should be clearly distinguished from a
myopic anti-communism.

As Senator Frank Church points out in the Feb. 14
issue of the New York Times Magazine, containment of
China and simplistic anti-communism cannot be equated.
Yugoslavia though a Communist state has proved useful in
Europe for our Russian containment policy. It might be
added that the other East European countries though still
Communist are no longer mere satellites of Russia. Their
contacts with the West are growing every year.

In Asia, thehistoric factors are every bit, if not more,

favorable for a similar policy. We have only to give these

factors a chance to operate.

Not many people are aware of the fact that the Chinese
have been the historic enemy of the peoples of Indo-China
for_over a thousand years. (See any history of Southeast
Asia.) Yet now Ho Chi Minh, president of North Viet Nam,
is constantly proclaiming the everlasting friendship be-
tween his people and the Chinese. To say that H0 is overly
friendly with China simply because he is a Communist and
they are Communists is to overlook the Yugoslav-Soviet
and the Sino-Soviet splits.

HO CHI MIN H is friendly with the Chinese because
they, along with the Russians, supported his efforts to win
independence from France. We on the other hand, sup-
ported, and in the south of Viet Nam, eventually replaced
France. South Viet Nam would not now exist if we hadn't
interfered. In the eyes of Ho Chi Minh——and all too many
South Vietnamese —— the United States has replaced the
French as the white imperialist power.

The Chinese are thereby able to pose as the champion
of the Asians. Our presence in Viet Nam makes race an
issue. Racism overshadows nationalism. The result is that
the traditional enemies, the Vietnamese and the Chinese, are
thrown into a deep embrace. It should also be noted that
even though they are not communist, Burma and Cam-
bodia also have moved closer to China.

Our policy brought about exactly the opposite of our
desired goal; it has actually contributed to the expansion
of Chinese influence. A continuation of such a policy is
not, therefore, in our national interest.

Those who insist that a Viet Cong victory in South
Viet Nam would be a blow to our national interest base this
View on the so-called domino theory. In my ﬁnal article-I
will argue that the domino theory is based on false assump-
tions. And based on the previous analysis, I will offer an
alternative to our current Viet Nam policy.

Gymnasts Gain Even
Season with Victory

By TOM SACKS
The gymnastics team finished up its season with
an even won-lost record — an accomplishment Which
might be termed modest by many, but in view of past
performances it can be considered quite an achievement.

The 84-40 win over Georgia Tech Mondaymarked
the ﬁrst time the gymnasts had broken even in four
years. Last year the squad recorded only two wins.

The highlight of Monday's ﬁnale, which was plagued through-
out by unpolished Tech performances, was Dave MCKinniS 011
the still rings. His 9.4 rating, performed in the nearly empty,
Field House, indicates that he might be able to hurprise some
judges in the EIGL championships this coming weekend at
Temple.

Jim Sacco won the all-around with a. ﬁrst place on the
horizontal bar, second on the parallel bars and ﬂoor exercises.’
third on the side horse and fourth on the still rings.

Senior Roland James closed out his dual meet career with
the top rating on the side horse. He was followed by McKinnis,
who also had placed ﬁrst in the ﬂoor exercises.

lg Perez captured two ﬁrsts on the parallel bars and long

‘horse, plus third place ﬁnishes on the still rings and floor

exercises.

Coach Warren Neiger is taking six men with him to the
EIKL’s and hopes to be surprised by at least three of them.
“We had a goal set at something a little over a .500 season, but
we kind of suspected this,” said Neiger. “McKinnis put on quite

As Penn State prepares
for the NCAA triple-header
at the Palestra this Monday,

the Panther basketball team
faces Carnegie Tech at the
Skibo Gym tonight.

The near win against the
Lions tired out the hoopsters,
according tocoach Bob Timmons.
Consequently, the team practiced
yesterday in their‘ only prepara-
tion for the game against the
Tartans.

Timmons probably doesn’t re-
gard the Carnegie Tech squad as
a major basketball power. He
remembers the 83 -52 beating
that the Panthers gave them in
the season’s opener. Perhaps he
also remembers Don Keefer, the
5’-10" center that outrebounded
Bob Lovett, the hoopsters lead-
ing rebounder.

If so, Timmons has little to
worry about, Keefer scored three

Rees Prepares For IC4A;
De1Vecch-io Goes in 600

“Stay loose,” said track coach Carl Rees to Bill Del-
Vecchio during the week between the Baltimore Invitational
and the Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of
America (IC4A) Championship meet. .

, Rees had good reason for him to stay loose. During the
Baltimore Invitational, De1Vea:hio placed third in the 600-

yard run, ﬁve yards behind two
Olympic pacers. “I was disap-
pointed in my ﬁnish,” said Del-
Vecchio, “. . . but I felt Satur-
day's race was my best effort
this year.”

Prior to this year, he competed
in the 220 and the 100-yard dash.
He switched to the 600 and es-
tablished a Field House record.
“In longer races, you get a chance
to test yourself but in that last
meet, I wasn’t used to the track.”

DelVecchio also ran in the
mile relay with Dick Crout, Fred
Poellnitz, and Luddy Hayden.
The team placed behind Ameri-
can University and runner - up
Villanova.

“Their time could have been

‘better but their ﬁrst experience

with the sharp banks and cmves
of a small track proved trouble-
Some.” said Rees. “Of course,
there is no small track to prac-
tice on aroimd here.”

In addition to taking DelVec-
chio to New York, Rees plans to
enter Hayden in the broad-jump
and hurdles and Jim Flanigan in
the shotput. “I hope those two
and (Damien) Koch, in the mile,
and (John) Bailey (two mile)
qualify so they can score points
in the ﬁnals.”

One can only wonder what the
freshman basketball team's sea-
son might have been if two of
their starters had not been aca-
demically ineligible.

Without Bill Buck to provide
the needed scoring ability at the
center post and without Bill Bor-
ellis to spell the overworked
guards, the Cubs lost ten of their
last 12 games to ﬁnish the sea-
son with a 4-12 record.

Ken Bollens emerged as the
prime frosh prospect for next
year’s varsity starting team. He
averaged a little less than 20
points per game during the sea-
son,

Frank Famularo, according to
coaches Carl Peterson and Bob
Timmons, is capable of playing
good varsity ball. He came on
very strong in the last few games,
hitting with his jump shot from
the outside and also driving in
for layups. His points against
Slippery Rock was second high
game only to Bollen’s 36 against
Steubenville.

LONDON DOCK

  

By BILL CABIN

Jim Alcom had football
scholarship offers from Min-
nesota, . Virginia, and Wil-
liam and Mary two years ago,

‘, but went to Bethany. Now he is

here,

Alcom led Penn Hills High
School to two consecutive 8-1
records, while gaining All-State
honorable mention as a quarter-
back. “I talked with someone

_ , from Pitt towards the end of my

senior season,” said Alcorn, “but
nothing ever came of it."

Although he played varsity ball
as a freshman, Bethany proved
too small for him. “I wanted to
go to a bigger school nearer to
home,” said Alcom. “I talked to
one of the football coaches, and
he told me I would have to pay
the ﬁrst year, but after that I’d
get a chance for the team.”

“We can not encourage people
to transfer schools,” said back-
ﬁeld coach Bimbo Cecconi, “but
he came here on his own and

3 rm hoping hem ﬁt in and help

us, He's got a good strong arm
and a lot of desire, and I’m
anxious to see him this spring.

“I never saw him play high
school hall myself,” continued
Cecconi, “but some of our play-
ers saw him and thought highly

’‘,‘of him."

Although Alcom worked with
the team last fall, this year will
be his ﬁrst time going both ways
against the varsity line. Besides
the varsity line, Alcorn must
compete with ﬁve other quarter-

‘ . aback candidates including Ken

Lucas, Ed James, Tippy Pohl,
Bob Bazylak, and Pete Elliot.

But competition does not de-
ter Alcom. “I ﬁgured there would
be good players at any big school,"
said Alcom, “but I have a good

7" --passing game, and intend to go-

»as far as I can in athletics.”

“We will start practice consi-
dering all quarterbacks being on
the same level,” said Cecconi.
“In the spring we'll determine
whether we'll use specialists or

-- ruse them both ways. Alcom is

probably more of a passer than
a runner, and if he ﬁts into the
team, then it will be a different
story.”

Athletics for Alcorn include
varsity basketball. “I have two

-‘years of eligibility here and orig-
‘anally planned on going strictly

for football. But Tim Grgurich
talked to me and if things go all
right, I think I’ll go out for bas-
ketball."

Swimmers Bypass Easterns

’By GEORGE LIES
The Eastern Collegiate
Swim Meet is scheduled for
March 12 and 13 at Yale

and the National Collegiates,
March 25-27 at Iowa State
but the swimming team's en-
tries in both championship meets
number zero.

Due to a lack of depth and
quality in his squad, coach Ben
Grady can send no one to the
spring tournaments, Grady fore-
saw this weak year and labeled
it a “rebuilding season.”

Andy James emerged as Grady’s
early season tournament candi-
date but he couldn’t make the
cut—off times. James might have
been entered in the 50-yard free-
style but “it would be too ex-
pensive to send a man for only
one event,” said Grady.

Bolstered by a good crop of '_
' ‘ Attention SENIOR 8; GRADUATE MEN Students-U.S. Citizens

freshmen. the team will be ham-
pered by inexperience next year
but not a lack of depth. “Of
course, you can’t prepare for the
future unless you're sure all the
swimmers will return,” said

After obtaining the freshmen
swimmers’ times in all four
strokes, Grady determines the
best event for the boy. Some-
times, as in the case of Bob Dat-
tola, a swimmer will switch his
event. “In high school I swam
backstroke,” said Dattola, “but
now I swim in the breaststroke
because other fellows were fas-
ter in the back than me.”

This ear six records were tied
or broken; the backstroke time
was set twice. Phil Reynolds of
Bucknell broke Army's Paul
Bucha’s record by 3.8 seconds in
the 200—yard backstroke, swim-
ming it in 2:20.

Bucknell also established a
new 400-yard medley relay rec-

cord of 3:-19.6, breaking Mary- ANDY JAMES _

Young men of ability can get to the top fast at
Boeing. Today, Boeing's business backlog is
just under two billion dollars, of which some
60 per cent is in commercial jetliner and heli-
copter product areas. The remainder is in mili-
tary programs and government space flight
contracts. This gives the company one of the
most stable and diversified business bases in
the aerospace industry.

No matter where your career interests lie-
in the commercial jet airliners of the future
or in space-flight technology—you can find
an opening of genuine opportunity at Boeing.
-The company's world leadership in the jet
transport field is an indication of the calibre
ofpeople you'd work with at Boeing.

Boeing is now pioneering evolutionary ad-
vances in the research, design, development
and manufacture of civilian and military air-
craft of the future, as well as space programs
of such historic importance as America's first
moon landing. Gas -turbine engines, transport
helicopters, marine vehicles and basic re-
search are other areas of Boeing activity.

Whether your career interests lie in basic or
applied research, design, test, manufacturing
or administration, there's a spot where your
talents are needed at Boeing. Engineers, math-
ematicians and scientists at Boeing work in
small groups, so initiative and ability get max-
imum exposure. Boeing encourages participa-
tion in the company-paid Graduate Study
Program at leading colleges and universities
near company installations.

We're looking forward to meeting engineering,
mathematics and science seniors and graduate
students during our visit to your campus. Make
an appointment now at your placement office.
