Organizations Give ‘Aid

Contributions to aid in the pub-
lication of the Servicemen’s edi-
tion of‘ The Pitt News have been

received from various student or-

ganizations on campus. Men's

' ’-Council topped the list with a
‘ ‘generous appropriation; Student

organizations which also lent a

Gmembers of the faculty, and stu-
dents lined the aisles. Army and
gold-braided Naval oiﬁc-ers, work-
men in overalls, and people from
the neighborhood joined to pay
tribute to our late lea-der.

Dr. William R. Farmer preach-
ed a brief service.gHe said, “At.a
time like this words are inade-
quate to express the depth of this
immeasurable -disaster which has
happened to our country and to
the world .and to all that makes
the world worth living in.

“I\ -will make no attempt to
eulogize -our late President. All
that anyone ever criticised him
for is gone now. The only thing
we know now is that he was our
lea-der and that he is dead; the
Commander—in—Chief of our ﬁght-
ing forces, and he is dead; our
President, and he is dead. All the
other is .gone. But all that We
loved him for has -become an in-
spiration.”

The service was opened with
the reading of the ninetieth and
twenty-third psalms and the ﬁf-
teenth chapter from the ﬁrst Cor-
inthians «by Raymond F. Britt-ain.
The Chapel choir sang.

Day and evening classes were
can-celled at noon, and all social
events were postponed. The grav-
ity of the studentabody was all-
inclusive. In one class, a student
a-dmonis-hed, “Shh,” as the pro-
fessor walked to «the rostrum. A
number of instructors could not
continue their morning classes.
Students sought out the quiet of
the Commons room, or stood on
the lawn gazing at the ﬂag at
half-mast.

Greetings to you who repre-
sent the University of Pitts-
burgh in the different branches
of service throughout the world.

We at home are reminded of
you -daily: The service ﬂag in
the Commons Room now has
8,664 stars. Not a week passes
but some of you on leave drop
in for a friendly visit. Your
letters give us a glimpse of
your strenuous life. The daily
war news lets us know that
you are succeeding gloriously
‘in what you have set forth to
do.

All this makes us feel near
you, proud of you, and deeply
grateful for your part in pre-
serving our democracy and its
institutions. What you are do-
ing out there guarantees to
American children a thousand
little things which are a sacred
part of our heritage.

Our prayers are for your
safety. .
R. H. Fitzgerald.

1 Hello! ' '

, Here we are-with another servicemen’s issue of The Pitt

_News,. written especially for our Pitt men and women in the

‘Armed forces all over the world. The staff considers it a privi-

lege and a duty to edit this issue-—-a privilege, because we are

writing for men and women who know the deprivations and

'.__gg,aunt realities involved in this war, who are in training camps

f_,nd_ on foreign soil so that people like us can walk into -the

Fifth avenue entrance ofthe Cathedral every day-—a duty, be-

,'cause you are, in all respects, still one of us, still interested in

aithe happenings, the activities, the people of the University.

_ g,  this edition, we have endeavored to print everything

 -you might wish to know. There are news stories and articles of

5yourselves and your former Pittt friends; “Frat Facts” has in-

I-ipformation concerning your fraternity; two special features
about staff members of the University and campus activities at
present have been incorporated so that you might have an idea
what’s going on during your absence; lead stories and the
;spoI'.ts page deal with prevalent news about your school.

' - At this time, Pitt has an enrollment of 30% men and 70%
2W;ome.n. Of the men, over 300 are returned veterans, Every
-semester, we get an increasing number of ex-GrI’s, navy men,
marines, seabees and air corps returnees. Some of them have
attended college here before entering the service. Others are

eginning or continuing their education under the GI Bill for
theﬁrst time at Pitt. \Ve have a special vete-ran’s association
for them, one that is continuously growing in numbers, and the
mien, once more, are starting to become more prominent in our
activities. When you return, the veteran ’s association will
.pr;obably be more decided in strength, even a greater institution
at Pitt than it is now.

, ,. Pitt is doing its best to carry on until you come back to us.
Thescope of our social life, of course, has been narrowed, and
 dances are not as numerous as they were formerly. A few
' our ac.tivities.aren’t asexpansive as before—for instance, the
blication of The Panther, our magazine, has been discontinued
.fl1,_i;_il after the war. YMCA membership is li1nited———(Freshman
Canip was a one-day affair on campus last fall.) Pitt Players
do not stage as many productions as when you were here. These
and others are waiting for your leadership and participation.
Hpwever, Spring Festival and many familiar traditions are
 flifnctioning. The students want to keep Pitt as you remember it,
so that you might melt into our group once more and become an
mportant factor in the continuance of our activities. VVe don’t
ant you to have to build us up to what we were when you left.
,  You have with you always the best wishes of the faculty,
I-he students, The Pitt News staff—of us who want you to
‘ome-back soon. Not long ago, The Pitt News printed 21. story
, bout,J0e, the janitor at State hall. Joe said all he wanted was
to _“see the familiar faces of the boys” at the Hall once more.
That is the ever-growing sentiment of everyone of us. In our
own way, we are doing our utmost to insure your quick return
Pitt has continuously gone over the top in school war bond
ampaigns, but we know it is you who are doing the most.
‘ ‘Now, through The Pitt News we send you our regards and
eetings. Until we see you walking into the ’l‘uck Shop with
math book in your hand, until you’re with us once more in
hestudent cheering section at the football games, you have our
od—1uck remembrances. ‘
 Don’t forget that Pitt’s here, waiting for everyone of you
0: come back. May that great day come soon!

All you Pitt men and women in
all parts of the world probably
stop every once in a while and
wonder “Is the Tuck Shop still. the
same? Who’s who in the Dean of
Men’s Oﬂice?” or “Is Ann still
answering those millions of phone
calls?”

If you were to return tomorrow
you would ﬁnd things pretty much
as you left them. You would be
met by' Mr. Daufenbach’s cheery
greeting, and incidentally here’s
his message to you. “I have
missed a lot of you boys at "Pitt
dances in the past two years. You
have the Heinies and Japs on the
run now. Keep up the good work
and never give them a break; they
have proved that they never give
you one!!”'

“I hope I am here to greet you
all when you return.” That’s the
wish of Ann, the chief switchboard
operator and she says “I miss you
all-—-John Bracken, Bill Rial, Dick
Harmon, Jack Punzals in particu-
lar. Hurry back.”

Mr. Arthur has returned to the
dean of «men’s ofﬁce ‘after serving
as a Lieutenant in the Naval Air
Corps for almost two years. Miss
Rowbottom, editor of the Pitt News
43-44, secretary in the ofﬁce, is
now employed with the Hospital
Service Association. A new ad-
dition to the staff of the dean of
men is George Hoffman, former
captain in the air force. Mrs.
Dorﬁeld’s only remark was, I love
you all and hope to see you return
soon.” Mr. Brittain, assistant to
the dean, was recently made a
member of ODK.

Speaking of the Tuck Shop, we
know you will immediately re-
member the man with the news-
paper, “Doc” Ferguson. He was
given 'a blue leather brief case for
Easter by‘ the “Tuck Shop Gang.”

Of course, all of you sociology
students remember Dr. Elmer.
Some real news about him is that
he has just written a book entitled
“The Sociology of the Family.” It
has not yet been published. 9

Any of you brilliant people who
were fortunate enough to receive
an honor scholarship will remem-
ber Mr. Quick, registrar, with
whom you had that important in-
terview. Mr. Quick reports that
in interviewing scholarship candi-
dates this year, more boys are
planning to go to college than ever
before.

Dr. Stinchcomb reports business
as usual in the classics department
and says “We are thinking of you
wherever you are, and we know
you are everywhere. Good luck to
each.”

You men interested in business
ﬁelds will be glad to hear that

v Dean Lanfeaar and staff are revising

their curriculum to ﬁt the'needs of
the returning veteran. They
would like you to feel that their
interest ’ follows the graduates
throughout their business careers.

Letter To Editor

March 13, 1945
J. G. Quick, R-egistrar
University of Pittsburgh
Pittsburgh 13. Pennsylvania
Dear Mr. Quick:

I want to call your attention to
the ﬁne work done for us by one
of your aiﬁiliated groups in hope
that you may be able to give them
some publicity in the Pitt Neius.

I refer to the Phi Epsi1on'Pi
Mothers Club, headed by Mrs.
Ben Halpern of 5447 Guarino
Road. This club was the ﬁrat or-
ganized club to sell bonds at Pitt,
as I understand.

Althou.gh they hav-e only 40
members, their bond sales are

amazing. Since the beginning of

1944 Mrs. Halpern has turned in
receipts amounting to $198,000.
Small groups such as this one
are -the backbone of our existehce.
There are few ways in which we
can -express our appreciation for
such ﬁne work, .-but we do believe
that :p'Ll‘bllCll;y is the best pat-on-
the-back. Therefore, I hope you
will do what you can.
Very truly yours,
MYRA ELMERS,‘
£Boo'th Chairman.
To the Editor of the Pitt News:
‘The events that took place at
noon of March 28 in the Tuck
shop, will long live in the mem-
ory of a certain Pitt professor of
economics. To all those of the
Tuck shop gang who honored me
far beyond my deserts in the pre-
sentation of an ‘all too expensive
brief case, go my heartfelt thanks
and my very sincere best wishes.
You should not have done it, gang,
but since you have, you may‘ res-t
assured that all of you have done
immeasurably more for me than
I ever have" for you.
What a gang you are! _
John Maxwell Ferguson.

A CHANGE
Student Editorial,
Pitt Evening News

, Change is as inevitable as
the passage of time. All things
change — the faces of loved
ones, the ‘friends Wh-have cher-
ished, the ideals we have be-
lieved in. If then, just‘ once in
our experience, we know some
person who remains always .the
same, always serene, stable,
and unchanging, that person
becomes a symbol of security
and permanence. , , '

Chancellor Bowman has been
that symbol to our University.

dAssists Vets"

(Ed. Note: The following United
Press news story is reprinted from
the Puerto Rico jigorld Journal,
March 3, 1945.) 

The 300 ‘returned war veterans
studying at the University of
Pittsburgh —— under the GI bill,
disability legislation, or on a reg-
ular tuiution -basis-—have made the
office of the Dean of Men their
post headquarters.

' The Dean of Men, Theo-dore W.
Biddle, meets -each returned serv-
iceman, and hears each tell his
own story in his own way. Then
Dean Biddle outlines the school’s
facilities, suggests courses for the
veterans, and introduces him to
students who have mutual inter-
ests.
His oiﬁce, Dean Biddle says, is
a “place of clearance” for “prompt
and complete” veteran counsel-
ing. “We want to make it easy
for the veteran to get started.
The veteran, Dean Biddle be-
lieves, does best as a regular stu-
dent in a regular program, where,

.while he gets the consideration

his problems warrant, he is “right
at home” and in no sense one of
a special group.

About a third of the 300 men
are former students of the univer-
sity.

Lehman Follows

Career in Army

Who says you can’t follow a
career in the Army‘? Sgt. Milton
Lehman, after entering the 104th
Medical Regiment then transfer-
red to the Public Relations Divi-
sion, established himself in the
work for which he was best
trained and -best suited, as staff
member of the Stars and Stripes.

In February, 1944, Sgt. Lehman
wrote of his experiences in Tu-
nisia and Sicily in the ‘‘Infantry
Journal.” Soon after this, he was
presented with the Sigma Delta
Chi professional journalism award
for editorial accomplishments with
the Stars and Stripes. His latest
article entitled “Poets in Pup-
tents” appeared in the New York
Timeh Magazine for March 11,
194%.

Aviation Courses Open
To Future Students

Future students in the‘College of the University of Pittsburgh
can be graduated with a “major” in aviation, that is with at least 24
of the 120 credits required for graduation earned in navigation,

meteorology, or geography.

In recommending that aviation be made a subject in which stu-

dents can specialize, the curriculum committee reports:
“As with other industries in the past, the aviation industry will

undoubtedly ﬁnd a growing neede
for -college trained men and wom-'

en. Institutions which provide
regular four year college courses
which include the opportunity to
develop and render effective an
interest in aviation will perform a
valuable service. Past and present
experience both in civilian courses
and in army training programs can
be a sound} basis on which an ex-
panded aviation program can be
built. Let it be said here with the

"new meaning that the University

of Pittsburgh points to the skies.”

In the freshmen and sophomore
years, certain subjects will be re-
quired. In the junior and senior
years, however, the program is to
be ﬂexible, changing with changes
in the aviation industry. It will
include opportunities for ﬂight
training. Since all other under-
graduate ‘schools of the University
can contribute special instruction,
the cornmitltee recommended the
new program be established on a
university-wide basis.

The college -co-mmzittee is head-
ed by Dr. James S. Taylor and
has as members, Dr. Whitford B.
Shelton, Dr. Richard Hope, and
Dr. Florence Teagarden.

Gilpatrick Awarded
Air Medal in Italy

Lt. ‘Ralph B. Gilpatrick, bom-
bardier of a B-24 Liberat-or in the
15th Air Force in Italy, was re-
cently awarded the Air Medal for
“meritorious arhievement during
aerial ﬂights over enemy terri-
tory.”

He is authorized to wear the
Distinguished Unit Badge as a

-member of a heavy bombardment

group which. has been cited by the
War Department for “outstanding
performance of duty in armed
conﬂict with the enemy.”

Lt. Gitpatrick attended the Uni-
versity for the school year 1942-43.

Besides the aviation “majors,”
a number of elective courses are
open to students specializing in
other ﬁelds. These electives in-
clude civil air regulations, ele-
mentary meteorology, geography
for aviation, the h-istory of air
power, navigation, physics and
ﬂight and «climate.

Nurse Serves
Overseas

Lt. Margaret J. Newcomer, an
army nurse with the 193rd Gen-
eral hospital somewhere in
France, ‘has been overseas since
last November. Before the 193rd
went to France and took over a
French hospital, sre spent some
time in the land of—as she puts
it—“heather, castles, Loch Lo-
mon-d, and chubby youngsters
with red cheeks and an incessant
chant of ’any gum chum’.”

In France, the hospital was in
an advanced sector for a time,
but the movement of the armies
put it in a communication zone,
so that Lt. Newcomer writes the
set-u-p is now very nice. 1

She is proud of the job the
hospitals are doing, and her let-
ters are full of such passages as,
“Soldiers are wonderful patients.
For many of them, the 193rd Gen-
eral is the ﬁrst touch of a decent
life they’ve had in months--the
ﬁrst ‘bed, sheets, good food,
warmth, cleanliness, and of
course, American girls ﬂuffing
their pillows and kidding with
them. They rarely speak of their
wounds.”

‘Lt. Newcomer attended the
School of Nursing at Pitt in the
spring semester of 1942-43.

Fortress pilot, 1st Lt. Chester 0.
Burford, former student at the

1 December 3, for the big bombers

after the formation had come back

A . to rest, Lt. Burford’s plane was

circling the home ﬁeld at last——
but only one engine out of four
was in full operation.

For him and his crew, it was
the end of a grim, day-long strug-
gle against the airplane itself. It
began with the number one en-
gine, where suddenly the pro-
peller was whirling at monstrous
‘speeds, the phenomenon called a
“‘run-a-way prop.”

Few mechanical conditions
threaten greater danger. There
was the chance that the propeller

5 ‘ shaft would snap, hurling the
‘ blade against the nose of the ship.

“I fought it as well as I could,”
Lt. Burford said. “It was no use.

was able to feather it, though,
and so we went ahead with one
engine on the debit side.”
Meanwhile, the number four en-

He tried the number one engine

renewed its wild dervish dance.

For hours he was engaged in a
desperate manipulation of the
controls, alternating_ﬁrst one, then

engines, drawing from them every
bit of power that would keep the
plane moving even a little further
on its slow, homeward way.

Mercy Story

From Lt. Col. James M. Mul-
len, Pitt graduate, who has been
base dental surgeon at Mitchell
field, N. Y. army air base for three
y.ealP8, comes this story.

He was talking to one of the
soldiers who had been a prisoner
of  and was rescued when our
troops drove the Germans out of
the town where he was hospital-
ized.‘ The soldier was on patrol
duty in a very swampy section
when he was severely injured by
88 millimeter shrapnel in the right
leg.- For 12 h-ours he lay there

under a terriﬁc bombardment. He ‘

had a rosary in his pocket which

he kept as a remembrance of one

of his Catholic bud-dies. In due

‘ time he heard a noise, and looking

     

up he saw two of our boys walk-
ing nearby with their hands over
their heads and 'a German guard
behind them. He called, “Kam-
erad,” and the German stopped,
raised his gun and said, “Trick,”
and was ready to kill the wound-
ed American, thinking he had a

 grenade in his hand. Our

soldier raised the rosary in the
palm of his hand and asked him
not ‘-‘to shoot. The German, recog-
nizing the rosary, came closer and
examined him. The German found
our soldier severely wounded and

‘had the two American prisoners

carry him to a -barn ‘behind the
German lines. “So there still is
some religion in some of the Ger-
mans,’f concluded Lt. Col. Mullen.

Musical Organization
Presents Concert

A concert will be presented by
the musical organizatiin of the
University on Friday, April 20, in
the Stephen Collins Foster me-
morial. It will begin promptly at
8 o’clock. There is no charge for
admission, but it will be by ticket
only. Tickets may be secured from
members of the organizations or
from the Information room. The
members may obtain tickets in
the dean of men’s‘oﬂ‘ii~ce.

After the concert, all members
of the music groups and their
guests are invited to a supper at
10 o’clock in the Army Mess hall.
Following this, will be the semi-
formal Spring Fever dance in the
Cathedral gym. '

In preceding years, it has been
the custom for each musical or-
ganization of the University to
present an annual concert. Be-
cause -of war conditions, the only
groups able to give these have
been the chorals, which have
maintained an active status but
h.ave been handicapped by the
war-time circumstances. In No-
vember, 1944, however, Mr. Rob-
ert L. Arthur, the former director
o-f the band and the orchestra,
returned from duty with the Navy,
and found that there was suffi-
cient student interest to make
plans and rehearsals worthwhile.
Today there are 38 members each
in the band. manage-d by George

 

Wright, and the orchestra, man-
aged by Ted Levy.

The Men’s Glee club, which dis-
-banded after an excellent min-
strel show three years ago, has
become active again, and now has
18 members. Dick Hargrave, E,
serves as president and Mr. The-
odore ‘M. 'Finney is the director.

Woman’s chloral, the only “all-
girl” group included, also under
the direction of Mr. Finney, will
forego its annual concertto work
in cooperation with the other
groups this year, President Eve-
lyn Kusserow, Ed., announced.

It was thought advisable to
present a combined concert at
this time rather than to offer each
organization in an individual per-
formance. Each of the musical
organiza-tions has in normal times
included in its annual calendar
many performances in the com-
munity as well as concert tours.
A return to -such a program of
activity is anticipated as soon‘ as
conditions permit.

It is the hope of the concert
committee, consisting of Mr. Ar-
thur, Mr. Finney, Ann Henry, C,
Evelyn Kusserow, Ed, Beatrice
Love, Ed, -Grant Lee, C, Ted Levy.
C, Al Pontiere, C, an-d George

take advantage of this opportu-
nity to see and hear the musical
talent of Pitt.

S-F Group
Initiate Series

Of Luncheons

Commencing this _afternoon,
Wednesday, Pitt students and fac-
ulty will initiate a series of in-
formal get-togethers in the Army
Mess hall. These lunc'heons will
be held at Oak Table in the Mess‘
hall at 12:3-0 each day. ‘

Richard Barnhart,

C, social

chairman of ‘Student Congress, re- 
vealed that the suggestion of Oak. “/7

Table luncheons was ma-de at a
meeting of Student Faculty Rela-

tions committee and Faculty Sen-. 
ate. The idea, referred to Stu-a 

dent Congress, was put -on an

experimental basis
“The idea proved success»ful,”
said Barnhart, “and will be ini-
tia:ted on a daily basis this noon."

Accor-ding to Miss Rush, many

members of both the student body it
and the faculty have long favored .' _

this arrangement. They feel that
informal get-togethers of this sort
wi.ll help t-o break down the feel-

ing of aloofness sometimes caused _

by the necessarily formal‘ rela-

tions between student and pro- ‘-

fessor that exist in the classroom.
“By breaking ‘down this feeling
with such arrangements as Oak

Table,” Miss Rush said, “students,

can learn to know the faculty,

not as their «teachers alone, but "

also as their personal friends.

“The present arrangement,” she’ I’
that the Social .

concluded, “is
committee of Student Congress
will each day invite six students

‘and four faculty members to the 

Oak Table.

Here it is! No longer does the
spring festival show have to be
referred to as “That show” (or
other unmentionabl-e titles.) No, .
’tis time; the judges have pon-
dered deep and long, -and
emerging from perspiring con-
ference decided on “The Sky-
scraper Capers.”

The lucky, lucky author of
our title is Ross Bush, C, and
to him we award two tickets for

I-F Spring Card
Gets Under Way

Competition began early last
week for the I-F ping pong cham-
pionship. The Pi Lams jumped in-
to an early lead by winning three
straight matches, one of which was
against a strong Phi Ep team.

Each match consists of’ four
singles games and one double/s
game. The winner must take at
least three out of the ﬁve events
in order to capture the match.

Although the SAE’s won the
championship last week, the play-
offs haven’t as yet begun for the
second place position in the I-F
basketball race. The Phi Eps are
slated to play the Phi Gains in the
ﬁrst game: the Pi Lams drew a
bye. The winner will play the Pi
Lams for the number two berth.

Every one of these letters is from

Capt. Glenn E. Musser, ’42, has
recently returned to the States
from a base somewhere in Green-
land, where he was stationed for
almost, two _ years. .

Lt. "Charles J. Miller is current-
ly in France with a 9th Air Force
medium bombardment group, a

their job is to “Strike the Hun,
where it hurts the most.”

Captain Robert B. Gump, ’42,
is stationed at the 170th General
Ho.spital in France. He says, “This
is a tent hospital, but we have
concrete floors and electricity. So
we are really well off.” Capt.
Gump also tells about meeting
A1 Kalirys in a little Stratf*ord-on-
Avon town, while on a recent
leave in England.

Capt. Norman W. Mochel ’42 has
had a unique experience, while
serving as an administrative of-
ficer with a Heavy Bombardment
group in_ Italy. Due -to cheapness
of labor and materials in war.-
time Italy, Capt. Mochel waspable
to hire a group of laborers to_
build him .a tone-room house,
where he is now living in com-
parative luxury in a location close
to his base. Capt. Mochel is also

.a member of FWHNSTB or Fa-

Now that preparations for Pitt’s spring show, “The Skyscraper
Capers,” are in full swing, the directors are having one horrible time
keeping their cast informed on rehearsals time. One day the cast
members to rehearse in Stephen Foster, the ‘next day it’s the Cathedral,
so of course they break up all -the Tuesday Musical performances by
barging into the Social room at the wrong time. 1

Oh, it’s really dreadful! Mr. Hodges, director, is getting “Tele-

That’s us! That is, it’s: the Comedy

Promoted

Leland D. Baldwin, former 1i-
brarian for the University of
Pittsburgh and now historian of
the 12th Air Force in Italy, has
been promoted to Lieutenant
Colonel, it has been announced
by the War department. ,

Overseas since August, 1942, Lt.
Col. Baldwin has seen service in
England, North Africa, and Italy.

Since arriving overseas, he has
served with both a troop carrier
wing and in headquarters of Major
General John K. Cannon’s 12th
Air Force, compiling with his
assistants, the achievements of the
12th as it strikes at enemy lines
of communications, installations
and personnel in the Mediterran-
ean Theater of Operations.

Lt. Col. Baldwin was graduated
from Greenville (Ill.) College in
1921 with an A.B. degree and
eleven years later gained a Ph.D.
from the University of Mi-chigan
in history and library science.

Evening Classes Show
Variety of Occupations

A letter carrier, a milkman, ‘a shoe repairman, and a piano re-
pairman are among the 3,672 taking evening classes at Pitt. A physi-
cian, a meteorologist, two missionaries, and 19 ministers are also at-
tending. So are three Army and two Navy men. There are two bor-
ough clerks‘ and one constable, 10 housewives, and one domestic who
are evening students. Two are bank tellers. Two are automobile
salesmen. Two are beauticians. From 50 to 100 are accountants.
¢The same number are engineers or
nurses, and 243 are teachers.

Of more than usual interest, is
a report on new students in Pitt’s
late afternoon, evening, and Sat-
urday classes. The report, ﬁrst
of its kind, is based on a ques-
tionnaire issued to 1,000 new-
comers to the Pitt campus the past
fall. Its purpose was to ﬁnd out
what adults want to study and

Sgt. Wroblewski Serves
In 15th Air Force

Sergeant iHarry F. Wrobleski, 19,

former student at the University,
is a ball turret gunner on a 15th
Air Force Flying. Fortress and a
member of the oldest heavy bom-
bardment group in the Mediter-
ranean Theater of Operations.
His group ﬂew the ﬁrst Flying
Fortress bombing mission over
Europe on August 17, 1942 against
the railroad yards of Rouen,
France, and has ﬂown more than
400 combat missions, bombing
enemy installations in almost
every Axis-dominated country

to Dr. Frank W. Shockley, director
of these classes. He explained:
“An additional reason was our

large evening enrollment, the
largest since before the war. With
so many new people on the campus
 we needed to know something
~ ;’ about them, what studies they
want.” _

The questionnaire shows one
very deﬁnite trend in education,
according to Dr. Shockley who
said: 1

“The largest number is more
interested in liberal arts courses
than in anything else. That may
seem strange in war times, but it
is not so diﬁicult to see when one
realizes that those who needed it

doing jobs for which they were
trained, either in the service or at
home.” '

The new students have elected
courses in English, in the classics,
in music appreciation, and in his-
tory with considerable numbers in
mathematics and chemistry.

As for reasons for attending the
University, for 462 it was “to in-
crease knowledge and general cul-
ture” while 445 said they were
there because they were “working
towards a degree.” Some 3'16
wanted to “do better work on the
*» present job” and 148 said they are

W“ " here to “prepare for a new job.”
Of the 1,000 questioned, only 54
said they were attending Pitt be-
cause they were interested in a
particular course.

Experiences

F In Service

Pitt, with the largest veteran
enrollment in the nation, is one
of the few schools that can boast
o-f h-aving students who have ex-
perienced the hell of present—day
warfare, and who can recou-nut ad-
ventures that must remain in the
story-«book for most of us.

Two Pitt men whose lives have

met the uncertainti-es of mod-ern ~

war are Barket Haddad and Wil-
liam Dale Connolly. In the intelli-
gence branch of the artillery,
Haddad was with the famed First
Infantry -division in North Africa.
He took part in ﬁve major African
campaigns .and was wounded at
the battle of Kasserine pass. His
adventure there tells how he had
to ﬁght his way back to the Allied
lines which had receded 27 miles;
how -after -hand-to-hand battle,
he was missing in action for ﬁve
days. When he was found, he was
immediately hospitalized and ship-
ped to the United States where he
recupe-rated at the Valley Forge
General hospital. In May, 1944,
he zcceived an honorable dis-
charge, and came to Pitt last Sep-
tember where he enrolled in the
School of Business Administra-
tion.

William Dale

Connolly, of

Franklin, Pa., enlisted in the Navy '

at 17. After training in aviation
at Pensacola —— Florida training
base for nearly two years--he
went .-overseas in May, 1942. His
-ship was part of the famous Task
-Force 58, and as a member of the
Fleet Marines, he saw action at
Millanie ‘Bay, Cape Gloucester,
New Britain, Marsrall Islands,
and Truk. He was commended for
his action in these battles by Rear
Admiral Mitcher. Having received
head injuries in February, 1944,
he was hospitalized for several
months,‘ and ﬁnally discharged.
He is now studying Aeronautical
Engineering here at Pitt.

Block Awarded

  

Second Cluster  

Staff Sergeant Gerald L. Block,
former Pitt student, has been
awarded the Oak Leaf Cluster to
his previously won Air Medal for
“meritorious achievement” while
participating in bomber combat
operations over Germany and
enemy occupied Europe. (This is
the Sergeant’s second Oak Leaf
Cluster in lieu of additional Air
Medals.)

Sgt. Block, armorer-gunner on
a B-17 Flying Fortress, is a mem-
ber of the 91st Bombardment
group, veteran heavy bomber unit
of more than two and one-half
years service in the European
Th-eater of Operations. He recent-

Bliley Lauds
Red Cross

Worliers

Veteran Bob Bliley, C, has a
lot to say for the American Red
Cross, and he speaks from experi-
ence.

Bob was stationed at Green-
wood air base, in training to be
a warrant oiﬁcer, when he was
in an accident that resulted in a
-broken neck. After a few weeks
at the Greenwood base hospital

he was sent to Kennedy General
Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.

During his convalesence at
Memphis, the Red Cross workers
helped Bob keep his mind off the
cumbersome brace and cast he
wore by talking with him and
keeping up his spirit. He tells of
one woman who made him over-
come his discouragement by tell-
ing him she had spent six years
in hospitals for injuries which
have made her lame. “She made
me feel I could recover, as she
did,” he says.

The organization supplied a
library on wh-eels for «bed-ridden
patients. Two recreation halls
kept the boys in practice with
ping-pong and other games. Trans-
portation to and from town was
provided for the patients by the
Red Cross, and workers often in-
vited them to their homes for
meals.

Bolton Receives
Rank of Major

Dr. Howard A. Bolton, a grad-
uate of Pitt Medical School, class
of 1937, has recently received the
rank of major in the Southwest
Pacific area. He is the assistant
chief of medicine, serving with the
Pitt Medical unit in New Guirféé
since last summer.

For a year following his entry
into the army in July, 1942, Major
Bolton was stationed at Fort Lewis,
Washington, after which he went
to Walter Reed hospital, Washing-
ton, D. C., where he specialized in
the study and treatment of tropi-
cal diseases. He went overseas in
January, 1944, and spent six
months in Australia before being
sent to New Guinea.

While at the University, Dr. Bol-
ton was assistant health director
under Dr. H. C. Carlson and a
member of Nu Sigma Nu frater-
nity. He is a graduate also of

I _’ F aberman Reports  

In War-Time France

Dean of Men Biddle receives daily letters from Pitt servicemen
scattered over the earth. From these members of the “Pitt Clubs,”

organizations of Pitt servicemen

wherever they are found, come

stories of life in war countries that are graphic in their portrayal of
what our men are now experiencing.

One of thevmany interesting reports of life in war—time France
has come to Dean Biddle from Lt. Martin Faberman, a Pitt man of

several years back. Lt. Fabermane

is now stationed in Paris, France.
His let.ter presents a vivid picture.

“My experiences, in compari-
son to most of the other boys, are
very slight,” he wrote. “But, they
are worth some memories. I have
seen a great deal of France. In

fact, I have seen enough. Experi-

ences add up to expectations of in-
cidents that usually occur where
there is ammunition. Some have
been close; others were fun. But,
I’m still healthy, happy, and sober!
I think my biggest thrill thus far
has been a visit from General
Eisenhower to his Depot. He
seemed very well pleased, and
made our Depot Commander, who
was a Lt. Col., a full Colonel right
on the spot. Yep, Ike’s visit was
the best. We have had quite a bit
of other ‘brass’; yet, that visit just
topped them all . . . Our Christ-
mas explosion was pretty good,
but we aren’t permitted to say
much about that now. I guess
that’ll just have to wait for our
meeting back in Pittsburgh.

“I have also managed to obtain
a few souvenirs. Namely, a Ger-
man Lugar and a Gestapo Auto-
rnatic. Ammunition for those are
no problem because our supply
does not stop with Allied ammo.
We have a large quantity of Ger-
man ammo, too, since this place
was one of the Germans’ main
supply points.

“My living conditions have
changed considerably since the
last time I wrote you. Our men
are now living in a beautiful
French Chateau. We ﬁve oﬁicers
have a private home, completely
f‘urnished——all for ourselves. I
have the swellest innerspring mat-
tress! So you see, I have no right
to complain. My comforts are
about the best that can be ex-
pected under the prevailing condi-

Dent Student
Sees Australia

For any readers who may be of
the Dentistry class of 1921, here is
something of interest from one of
your former classmates, Major
Walter S. Hanna, probably one of
the first Pitt graduates to answer
the call to the colors. He was
called to active duty October 1,
1940. After spending 17 months
at Fort George G. Meade, Mary-
land, he was shipped overseas and
landed in Australia on April 6,
1942. Major Hanna has seen a lot
of the show, from the beginning to
the end, in New Guinea. At the
end of rtre ﬁghting in New Guinea
he was wounded by shrapnel from
a J ap bomb, for which he has been
awarded the Purple Heart. At the
present time, he is somewhere in
the Dutch East Indies serving as
chief of oral surgery at the 132nd
General hospital.

Major Hanna said he has met a
lot of Pitt men overseas and hopes
to see them again after the war.

By Ed Citron, Sports Editor

, With the ﬁrst drills scheduled for June, football is once
again popping back into the picture. And, speaking of football,
here ’s one that Knute Rockne sprang once at a spring “skull”
session. He aimed to have a squad of quarterbacks.

‘‘All right,” he opened up one day at the blackboard,

“we’re playing Southern Cal next fall and we’re starting now.
Williams kicks off and Flanagan brings it back to the -25-yard

line. What ‘play should they call, “Pete “J”

“Pete” Weibel was a bear-like nfreshman who lacked ex-

perience and mental alertness.

“Pass,” he answered. The squade

laughed.

“Funny, eh?” Rockne snapped.
“Pete’s all right. Williams passes

, over the line to the end; Niemic,

who should be covering, is scan-
ning the stands to see if his new-
est girl is in section 23, row F,
seat 12--the play goes for fifteen
yards. Next,'O’Boyle?”

“Off-tackle.”

“Not bad for a glee clubber, Jim,
not bad. The Trojan end has just
called Rastowski a bolshevik and
they make ‘six yards over our
debater. What play, Pete?”

“Pass.” ' V

“No good this time because
Niemic has located his girl but
sees her talking to a movie actor
and so rushes up savagely to
ground the ball; of course he
might have intercepted and run

‘for a touchdown but he wanted to

do something vicious. Flanagan?”

“Oﬂ3—tackle.”

“No ‘good; our line has ﬁnished
it’s conversation and stops them
with two yards in three tries.
Parisienne?”

“Ki-ck it.”

‘ “Art lugs it ten yards along the
sidelines to our thirty, being care-
ful to get out of bounds at the last

-minute. Pete?”

“Pass.”

.“We’re playing football, not
basketball. You know—eh? All

.right—just so it’s clear in your

mind. We pass to Weibel who
misses the signal and is busy
blocking the halfback while the
ball rolls ‘down the ﬁeld. Collins?”
“Punt.” '
“Flanagan kicks to their thirty

where they put .the ball in play.”

Southern Cal, kicking a ﬂeld
goal, led at the end of the half,
3-'0. Swinging into the final
period, the score was still* 3-0.

“All right, twopminutes to play,
their ball on their twenty, third
down; our line has stopped them
cdld and they're playing for time.
What play, Parisienne?”

“Better have them punt now.”

“Guess you’re right. Here it
comes—-oh, a beauty, to Parisienne
who catches it on the run, at mid-
ﬁeld, sidesteps the end, and works
his way downﬁeld. Art is_ a tough
guy--gives ’em snake-hips and
slips ’em stiff arms. He’s forced
out of bounds on the thirteen.”

“Minute and a half. Quick now?”

“Flanagan off left tackle.”

“Nine yards. Time for two
plays. Quick, Art.” Suddenly Art
shouted, “Whaddya say Pete?
Can you do it?” “Gimme that
ball,’’ Pete cried. “I’1l do it in
one.” Careful, ‘Pete—you’re tip-
pin’ off the play,” Rockne warned.
. Eyes ﬂaming, on his feet, “Makes
no difference, they can’t stop me.”

“There goes Pete,” Rockne cried,

‘fOh what a dive—he’s over, wait
;—-the referee is looking for the
ball—touchdown.”
_ The squad gathered around Pete,
congratulating him. His shoulders
twitched and his chest was out
farther than usual. -

Back in his office Rockne com-I
mented, “Couldn’t let ’em lose.
And, don’t forget, Pete made that
touchdown; in his head he's all-
American right now and'that’s just
what he needs.”

Carlson Ready for

April 23r-d marks the opening
of the ﬁrst war-time spring bas-
ketball training at Pitt. Dr. Carl-
son plans to put his proteges
-through an eight-day condition-
ing period, with practice sched-
uled on Monday,‘Tues-day, Thurs-
day and Friday of the two weeks.

Last year, and in the past war
years, the Carls-onzmen have been
getting late starts in their warm-
up sessions, which has been a
great hindrance in develop-ment of

'their offensive game. Not only has

this late start put the doctor’s
ﬁgure 8 behind the eight ball, but
also the late arrival of the ‘foot-

G Mitter1ing’s men, aided by the

Fates who have favored them
with perfect weather, have been
working out in intra-squad games
at the stadium for the last ten
days. There has been an average
turnout of about twenty-ﬁve
every afternoon. With things
shaping up as they are, the pros-
pects for a s-uccessful season look
mighty promising. C
Although ‘a ﬁrst team has, as
yet, not been selected, a tentative
ﬁrst string aggregation has been
pieced together. Bobby Lu-cchino
and Virg Fassio, a frosh pair,
have teamed up Was b.atterymen.

.McC1ure, another ﬂin.ger, has also

shown plenty of -stuff in practice
sessions. Cavorting around ﬁrst
base are Marsiglio and Johnny
Lozar, ‘both veterans of last year’s
squad.‘ At second base, hard-hit-
ting Red Matthews is back for
another season. Delancey, a classy
-ﬁelder, has {been at the shortstop
post while .Sa«m Consentino is
holding down the hot corner. Sam
has also been lbatting in the clean-
up slot in recent practice tilts.

In the outﬁeld there’s Joe Kielb,
last ye-ar’s catcher, in center and
Zim-movan in left. In right how-
ever, there’s a wide open fight
with about four men trying to
catch on. Pager, on last season’s
team, may have a slight edge on
the others. —

Spring Sessions

ball zplayers due to their daily
gridiron -drills, has set him back.
Dr. Carlson hopes to develop
two continuities in spring train-
ing. Each continuity has a num-
'ber of plays developed around it.
Last year the Panthers learned
but one continuity and used it
throughout the season, ending up
with an 8-won-and-4-1-ost record,
losing only on foreign soil. Ifthe
Panthers -prove themselves mas-
ters of their coach's offerings,
they might make it the second
Win ’em All season for the doctor
in his 24 years of coaching at the
Skyscraper University.
