Did you ever see four cats playing
cards?

In spite of our tendency to think
of cat drawings as merely “cute”and
dismiss them as such, the cats of

\ “Bernard Farmer’s Cats,” an exhibi-

tion currently on display at Pitt, are
drawn with quick, spare use of line.

Farmer’s- cats stand in for human
counterparts in situations that satiri-
cally comment on art, politics and
everyday life. ’

Also on display are two paintings
and a collage, done by Farmer in
1963, 1968 and 1974, respectively.
These are abstract images of muted
color and simple form that nicely
balance the quickness of the draw—
iags with a cool reserve.

The cat drawings are part of a
larger collection donated to the
Henry Clay Frick Fine Arts Library
by Alex and Anne Lowenthal and
their family. The collection appears
in a book, “MIAOW! MIAOW‘!”
published by Methuen London Ltd.

The Lowenthals received the
sketches in letters from Farmer, who
continues to work in London. The
paintings and collage were donated
by the Lowenthals to the University
Art Gallery, University of
Pittsburgh. ‘

The drawings will be on display at
the gallery until Feb. 15. M

The Pitt News, Wednesday, February 6, I985

  special people such as government

approved

WASHINGTON (UPI)— Aftera
year of delay caused by persistent
questioning of Edwin Meese’s
ethics, the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee voted l2-6 yesterday to
recommend approval of his nomina-
tion for attorney general. The vote
was close to party lines, except for
two Democrats whojoined Republi-
cans to vote for Meese. One ofthose
Democrats, Howell Heﬂin of Ala-
bama, said he decided to give Meese
“the benefit of the doubt." The full
Senate is expected to vote on the
nomination after returning from the
President’s Day recess later this
month.

Two other nominees for the Rea-

gan cabinet also were approved by a
Senate panel yesterday. Both won
unanimous committee ’ approval.
The two are Donald Hodel for secre-
tary of the interior and John Her-
rington for the Department of
Energy. President Reagan’s choice
for education secretary, William
Bennet, was OK’d’ by the committee
last week.— He’s expected to receive
full confirmation by today.

In another change in the adminis-
tration, officials announced today
that Patrick Buchanon will be the
new director of White House com-
munications. The conservative com-
mentator was a speechwriter for
Richard Nixon when he was presi-
dent. Buchanon will replace David
Gergen, who left the White House
more than a year ago.

Soviet air
disaster reported

MINSK, U.S.S.R. (UPI) ——
Word is just beginning to leak out of
the Soviet Union about an air disas-
ter that could involve foreigners and
high Soviet ofﬁcials. A provincial
newspaper reported yesterday that
an Aeroﬂot jetliner crashed Friday
near the Minsk airport. The plane is
believed to have carried 80 people,
and casualties are reported. The rea-
son foreigners and Soviet officials
are believed to be among the dead is
that the Soviet media rarely reports
plane crashes unless they involve

leaders and foreigners. Western
sources in Moscow have heard
reports recently that 19 generals and

in a plane crash. But it is not known
if it is the same one.

Bill introduced

WASHINGTON (UPI) — A bill
has gone before Congress to help
prevent the same kind of industrial
chemical disaster that killed 2,500
people in Bhopal, India, last
December. The bill is backed by law-
makers from three industrial north-
eastern states. It asks that factories
and warehouses be required to tell
local authorities about any poten-
tially dangerous chemicals they han-
dle, and to train police and
firefighters to deal with such disas-
ters. The bill was authorized by
James Florio of New Jersey. He’s
backed by congressmen from New
York and Pennsylvania. Florio said
there have been repeated cases of
chemical releases that could
threaten people's lives.

Violence breaks

out in Seoul

SEOUL, Korea(UPI) —_ Violence
against next week's South Korean
elections broke out in Seoul yester-
day. Witnesses said approximately
3,000 people took to the streets for
an anti-government rally and about
200 were arrested as riot police
moved with tear gas to disperse the
crowd. The protest was the largest in
Seoul since the student protests of
1979 and 1980. The rally was called
by a coalition of 322 civic, religious,
literary and labor leaders who
oppose the Parliamentary elections.

Florida convict

ATLANTA (UPI) - Carl Songer

several months. Songer is a Florida

  

 
     
  

 
       
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
     

convict who was scheduled to go to
Georgia's electric chair this morning
for killing a rookie state trooper in
I973. It looked like all his appeals
had run out, and he would have to
keep his date with the chair. But a
federal appeals court in Atlanta
stayed his execution on Monday,
pending a full hearing on his case.
The move means no action can be
taken against Songer for at least sev-
eral months. Songer has claimed
that he was using drugs at the time
the trooper nabbed him in a stolen
car and does not remember shooting
him.

Canines cause
town grief

FREMONT, Calif. (UPI) —— A-

problem of canine proportions faces
the city of Fremont, Calif. At issue
are Dennis and Dell Underwood’s
four miniature Pinschers and nine
Great Danes. The dogs became a
problem when one of the huge Great
Danes peered over a six-foot fence
into the yard of neighbor Jim Aus-
tin. Austin was scared, and so was
his Afghan hound, which howled.
Austin reportedly threatened to
shoot the next canine head that
appeared over the fence.

Animal Control officers were con-
tacted and said the Underwoods’ 13
dogs violate the city ordinance that
limits a household to seven small
dogs or five large ones. The Under-
woods said they cannot obey the
ordinance and asked city council to
bend the law, at least until the 13 are
reduced by attrition. Said Dennis
Underwood, “These dogs are just
like our kids."

He said the couple would rather

move away with the dogs than give
any of them up. As far as the city
council is concerned, a spokesman
said, “This is not the average case of
abused, starving dogs in filthy sur-
roundings.” According to the
spokesman, the Underwood pre-
mises are “super-clean, the dogs
well-fed and groomed and the
Underwood family most coopera-
tive.” Not only that, out Austin, the
next-door, neighbor who com-
plained, is complaining no more. It
seems Underwood put up a new
fence.

Pitt blasted
by Temple

gymnasts

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

It was one of those days when you
wish the other team didn’t show up.
The men’s gymnastic team arrived in
Philadelphia last Saturday expect-
ing a tough meet. What they got
from the Temple Owls was a per-
sonal demonstration on near perfect
precision. In simpler terms, Temple
was overpowering.

“They beat us man for man,” re-
plied head coach Frank D’Amico.
“The judging was near perfect. If we
would’ve done our best I still think
we would’ve lost. They deserved to
win.”

One previous concern which did
not serve as a factor in the meet was
the judging. Temple head coach
Fred Turoff arranged for the use of
four judges (instead of the usual
two), an ideal number for the con-
troversial sport.

D’Amico had no complaints. “We
did good but still had some costly
breaks," he said. “I’m not upset. If
you let the losses get you down,
you’re going to be in big trouble.”

In scoring an incredible 273 points
(Pitt had 260), the Owls managed to
set their own school record.

The deadly combination of youth
andtalent proved too much for the
Panthers as the Owls demonstrated
.. .i:gm onluanfngta in nearly every
event.

“We really didn’t do well in any
one event,” remarked All-East per-
former Matt Peters. “I think we did
the best we could. They had a few
transfers whom I’d never seen
before.”

One factor which may have
affected the Pitt performance was

ﬂoor routine.‘

Chaz Palla/I The Pitt News

the constant wear-and-tear the team
has gone through in the past few
weeks

“We went in there with our spirits

high, but it seemed like the traveling
really wore us down,” freshman
Jorge Sanchez added. “We expected
a tough meet and we got one."
_ Unfortunately, there appears to
be no letup in store for the Panthers
as they must face powerful Division
I teams in the next few weeks,
including Indiana State, Eastern
Michigan and Ohio State.

“We would like to keep our scores
up in order to get into the national
ratings," D’Amico stated. “It’s going
to be really rough, though, consider-

ing whom we have to face."

Nevertheless, the Panther attitude
is still on the upswing, something
they cannot afford to be without.
Pitt will host Eastern Michigan in a
key meet on Saturday, Feb. 16.

“It will be good to come back to
our fans,” said D’Amico. “The
crowd at Temple was a little ignor-
ant, sometimes jeering at inappro-
priate times.”

Whatever the case, the Panthers
will be striving to return to their win-
ning ways very soon. “We’ve got to
get our record back up,”sophomore
Kevin Garren concluded. “It’s no
fun to lose.”

Powerful Penn State women hand
Panthers disappointing loss 81-73

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News

Pitt and Penn State. No matter
what the sport, whenever these two
schools clash, the outcome is always
exciting, and last night was no
exception.

The 10th-ranked Penn State Lady
Lions visited Fitzgerald Field House
on Monday night, and headed back
to Happy Valley with an 81-73 vic-
tory, but it wasn’t easy. Penn State,
who already defeated Big East co-
leader Boston College by 42 points
earlier this season, found the goings
a little rougher in the Steel City.

Varsity

Press Box
Drugs

The University of Maryland is starting a drug
testing program for its athletes  in Sports
Briefs. 

Why are some teams comprised of Pitt stu-
dents "varsity" and others not? 

Penn State coach Rene Portland’s
seasoned squad proved too much for
the Pitt players as they pulled away
in the end and ended Pitt’s chances
for a major upset. i

Both teams exchanged leads
throughout the first half. Seniors
Jennifer Bruce of Pitt and Kahadee-
jah Herbert of PennState took turns
exciting the crowd, each with a daz-
zling array of moves. At the inter-

mission, Herbert had already tossed A

in 20 points while Bruce was good
for 15.

Pitt held heralded freshman Suzie
McConnell of Seton-LaSalle High
School in Pittsburgh scoreless
throughout the first half. Pitt’s Lisa
Fubio made her presence known,
grabbing two steals and keeping
McConnell in check.

_See page 15

In the meantime, McConnell’s
counterpart, Pitt guard Kim Tirik,
was in the process of playing, per-
haps, her best game of the season.
Tirik went into the locker room at
the half after dishing out six assists,
scoring eight points on 4-4 shooting
with two steals and the score tied
33-33.

Pitt coach Judy Saurer substi-
tuted freely throughout the first half,
as nine players saw action. In a
manner uncommon to the Panthers
of late, the squad enjoyed a good
half shooting-wise (58 percent),
compared to Penn State (44
percent).

Both teams came out ofthe locker
roomsiand began the second half
much the same as the first ‘half. Her-

Panthers finish strong,
deck Duquesne 77-61
before “audience”

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

Nearly four years separate the last
two occasions Pitt and Duquesne
stoked the intra-city basketball
rivalry that no longer is.

Ever since that inflamed Eastern
Eight championship game, the sea-
sonal how-do-you-do has deterio-
rated faster than several of the more
memorable Panther-Duke clashes.

Both schools and their basketball
don’t create any more memories
lately. Least of all Monday night at
the Civic Arena, where the Panthers
stomped the Dukes 77-61. Not that
there wasn‘t any excitement, due
solely to a team whose nine-man ros-
ter held several leads over the more
talented Panthers. Plus, Pitt (12-7,
3-5) committed I3 first-half turnov-
ers and Rick Suder ceaselessly
launched on-target volleys after
intermission.

Most of all, though, the Panthers
haughtily sensed blowout before
gametime and never finalized court
proceedings until 5:43 remained.
Forward Darryl Shepherd tipped in
a Keith Armstrong shot for a 63-51
lead.

“Over and over he sai A this game
is not a cakewalk,” Shepherd said of

Chipman’s pre-game “pep" talk.
“Over and over that this is a serious
game. Most of the players took it
seriously,—but we had to play Suder
and we didn’t realize how good a
player he is.”

Indeed, Duquesne’s marksman at
forward completed five straight
shots in the first four minutes of the
second half, putting the Dukes up
40-39 before Chipman called
timeout and plugged in a man-to-
man defense.

He pulled Pitt’s typical zone and
had Shepherd blanket Suder. The
cover held Suder scoreless, though
he led Duquesne with 15 points.
From there, Panther freshman
Charles Smith awakened, scoring 17
of his game-leading 23 points in the
second frame and leading all with 16
rebounds.

“He shot the ball as well or better
than anyone I’ve seen all year,
Shepherd said. “He could‘ve been
worn down, but he’s a zone player.
In man, he can’t operate as well.”

Suder’s shooting stretch wouldn’t
have mattered had Pitt not commit-
ted all but four of its 17 total turn-
overs in the first half. The Panthers
shot 50 percent compared with the
Dukes‘ oppressive 29.4. Yet Pitt
only held a 32-30 halftime
advantage.

P.S. -McKees.

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News

The Pittsburgh Hockey Club is
now ll-2-1 after outshooting Penn
State-McKeesport 40-13. The
Panthers managed to skate one step
closer to the championships by
upsetting the Saints, 9-1.

According to freshman left wing
Marc Bowers, the players were
rather aggressive as the Saints tried
wholeheartedly to gain their first
win of the season. “It got a little
rough. It was a little vicious at the
end. Penn State was frustrated
because they haven’t won a game all
season,” explained Bowers. “From
the beginning of the game, a couple‘
of their guys were really hitting hard.
We hit them back.”

Bowers assisted in two Panther S
goals on Sunday and has been gain-
ing the respect of his teammates
throughout the season. “He can

bert and Bruce battled over and
over, while Tirik and Fubio con-
tinued to hound McConnell. But, as
is the case with all great players, it
was only amatter of time before
McConnell would break loose.

And break loose she did. McCon-
nell scored her first two points after
she was fouled by Lisa Fubio and
converted the foul shots at the 10:25

. mark. Pitt led at the time, 49-45, but

from that point on, the Lions never
looked back. McConnell scored all
15 of her points in the ﬁnal 10 min-
utes of the game as Penn State
pulled away and finally revealed
why they were ranked No. 10 in the
nation.

The final score read 81-73 in favor
of Penn State, but in this gamethere
were few losers, but a lot of stars.
The evidence lies within: ’

0 Kim Tirik — The junior point
guard faced her biggest test of the
season, and graded well. Tirik fin-
ished with 16 points on 8-9 shooting.
All her shots were from outside of 15
feet, including three +20 footers late
in the game. In addition, Tirik
handed out 11 assists, grabbed three
rebounds and had two steals as she
and Bruce kept Pitt alive throughout

rebounds and added two steals and a

mark in career scoring.

0 Kahadcejah Herbert —— Herbert,
Penn State’s answer to Bruce, fired
in 30 points, but only missed two
shots the entire game and was a per-
fect 5-5 during the all-important
second half. The senior forward also
pulled down six rebounds and added
four steals.

9-10 clutch free throws down the -

assists and five steals.

For Penn State, the win marked
their sixth consecutive victory as
they attempt to catch St. Joseph’s in

The Pitt

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News

Contrary to not-so-popular
belief, no, Virginia, there is not a
“Pitt hockey team." Pitt does have a
registered hockey club which is com-
prised entirely of Pitt students but is
not sponsored by the university.

According to Terry Milani, asso-
ciate director of student activities,
the ice hockey club is a registered
organization at Pitt but is not certi-
fied as a recognized activity and
therefore is not supported by Pitt. In
other words, if you want to play
hockey or any other non-recognized
university sport, you’ll have to pay.
Since the university does not spon-
sor the hockey club, it cannot in any
sense of the word be called the “Pitt
hockey team” or affiliated with Pitt
in any way even though every
member of the “club” is a Pitt
student.

Confusing, huh? I guess “Pitt” is
‘sort of a registered trademark only

to be used by those teams which the
university can afford to support.

Why doesn't Pitt support a varsity
hockey team, rugby team or men’s
volleyball team? Did you ever
wonder how it is decided which
sports will be varsity and which will
not?

I called sports information and
associate athletic director Dean Bil-
lick gave me a rather lengthy list of
criteria which the university uses to
determine which sports should be
varsity. At the top of the list is
whether the sport is NCAA desig-
nated, followed closely by how
expensive the sport is to operate.
Also included are the level ofinterest
from the students, what kind of
recognition would be brought to the
university and whether the facilities
are available.

Since there is no ice arena on cam-
pus, the university would have to
rent one (if there was a “Pitt hockey
team”) and renting ice time is not
cheap. Presently, the ice hockey club
holds its games and practices at
Lakevue Ice Palace, near Butler.

hundred dollars and the university
cannot afford such an expense at
this time.

Although the university does not
support this team, should these ath-
letes be overlooked entirely? The
hockey club competes in a league
with such teams as Duquesne, CMU
and WVU, and holds an impressive
ll-2-l record. Don’t the non-
supported teams deserve the same
kind of recognition as the varsity
teams?

The reason I am so bent on this
argument is that, lately, the Pitt
News sports desk has been getting
several complaints about the recent
coverage given to the hockey club.

3‘ i’<'l\'i‘:Tr‘;7"’3I>’5i‘[/ .?‘I."’.zi/i 

Hockey is a winter sport and
nowhere is it written that The Pitt
News can only cover varsity sports.
By now you’re probably wondering,
“What's the matter with this nut‘? Is
she obsessed with hockey or what?"
Maybe, but this argument goes
much deeperthan just hockey.

I am very defensive of hockey
because, as you may have guessed, it
has become my favorite sport.
Growing up in a family of NHL
addicted brothers who eat, sleep and
think hockey every moment of the
winter months, I, too, became a
hockey-aholic. Eventually, Ibecame
oblivioussto the fact that not every-
one viewed hockey as such a big
deal. Often, I found myself in argu-
ments with people who felt that
hockey wasn‘t such a big sport in this
area. It took my younger brother,
Vince, to set me straight.

“Hockey isn’t big around here
because most people don’t under-
stand the game. If they just went to
one game, I bet about 50 percent of
them would go back again,” he said.
. Well, that’s true with most sport-
ing events, I suppose. Many of the

things we say we don’t like are things
that we never bothered to try.
Maybe if we took the time to attend
a sporting event that we supposedly
don’t like, eventually we might
understand what was goingon and
come to enjoy it. ,

We are conditioned to believe tha
football and basketball are the only
true collegiate sports. Don’t get me
wrong, I have nothing against foot-
ball or basketball. But why doesn’t
Pitt get as big a turnout for the gym-
nastics meets or the swim meets as it
does for the football and basketball
games? Is it that swimming and gym-
nastics are not interesting sports, or
is it that we don’t understand these
events as much and don’t care to try
them?

Come on, Pitt sports fans, as the
old saying goes, try it, you may just
surprise yourself and really like it.
At the very least, it would add some
variety to your life. Pitt has a lot of
talented athletes, both varsity and
non-varsity, who are worthy of
recognition. But they can’t all be
found on the football field or basket-
ball court. I

skate well and he's proving he can
put the puck in the net,” said left
wing Jim Godwin.

“Before the season is over, I think
that Marc will score a couple of big
goals for us," acknowledged co-
captain Jim Lang. *

The Panthers also competed in
two exhibition games with Ohio
University over the weekend. Only
half the team was able to make the
trip, leaving the Pittskaters at a dis-
advantage against Ohio University,
which is one of the top club teams in
the country.

While the Panthers lost both
games, they appreciated the oppor-
tunity to skate with this high inten-
sity team and felt that the stiff com-
petition in Ohio left them better pre-
pared to face arch rival Duquesne on
Saturday.

The Panthers last battled
Duquesne in December only to be
left with a disappointing 6-3 loss.

_ Will they fare better on Saturday?
“Only time will tell,” said Lang. “I
just know we have to play our best
game to beat them.”

The Panther defense will be with-
out senior Tom Dieffenbach, who
has been left idle after a knee injury
he sustained in the CMU game on
Jan. 27. Dieffenbach has proven to
be an effective member of the
Panther defense, and the hockey

 

club may have to make son
changes in the lines to compensate
for Dieffenbach’s absence. “Tom
has been playing very well lately,”
said Godwin. “If we reshuffle the
defensive pairings, we should get by
OK.”

Puck Notes: Defenseman Damon
Brown served a one-game major
roughing suspensionat Saturday’s

a Penn State game and will be back on

the roster for the Duquesne game.

Duquesne boss Satalin

tries to put troubles in past

By Jim urban
The Pitt News

Many local basketball junkies
opted totstay home Monday night
rather than venture downtown to
witness the annual battle between
Pitt and Duquesne. More than one
self-pronounced hoop expert on the
streets of Pittsburgh was heard to
say, “Pitt’s gonna blow ’em away.”
Such was not the case. The ﬁnal
score read 77-61 in favor of Pitt, but
this was no cakewalk for the Pan-
thers. Give the credit where it
belongs. The man’s name is Jim
Satalin.

Let’s face it, Pitt had a superior
team. Coach Roy Chipman’s start-

ing lineup included three high school‘

All-Americas while Satalin’s lineup
included three guards, a 6-6 forward
and a freshman center. The question
is, how on earth did Pitt trail 40-39
with just under 15 minutes
remaining?

Before we answer that question,
let’s first take a look at the Duquesne
season thus far. Since the fall semes-
ter opened, Duquesne lost the servi-
ces of six scholarship players. The
first four, Emmett Sellers, Ronnie
Stevenson, Greg Harrison and Eric
Compton, were lost to university
suspension after they were accused
of rape by a female student over the
summer.

Next, center Tom Harvey was
ruled ineligible by the NCAA. And
finally, guard Evie Waddell left
Duquesne and returned home to
Evansville, Ind., during the Christ-
mas break. Four of the players men-
tioned, Sellers, Harrison, Stevenson
and Harvey, ﬁgured big in Satalin’s
plan for this season. It was in the
cards that this was_ going to be a
dowzt,y¢.a.r..f.°J, ‘P3. D.3’l.‘E§-. .... .
m'¥es,' indee‘d,"the -Dukes are M2
overall and 3-7 in the Atlantic 10,
but just like last night, they always
seem to give every team they play a
run for their money. How did they
manage to give Pitt such a game?
“The coaches did a good job prepar-
ing us,” said senior guard Pat Far-
rell. “We played very good defense.”
Farrell and his backcourt mates,
Collins Dobbs and Rick Suder,
caused havoc in Pitt’s backcourt
throughout the first half. Pitt com-
mitted 17 turnovers in the game, 10
of which were by the guards.
Duquesne’s l-3-I defense with
Dobbs at the point caused Pitt prob-
lems most of the night, especially
Gore, who committed six turnovers
himself. “Collins Dobbs is a helluva
player at the top of the 1-3-1,” said
Farrell. “He really makes things
happen."

Suder, the junior from_Center
High School, downplayed his role.
“That’s Pat [Farrell] and Collins
[Dobbs] that key our defense,” said
Suder. “I just look for the ball."

Suder threw the biggest scare into
the Panthers when he hit ﬁve bombs
to open the second half. “Rick got us
off in the second half," said Satalin.
“He is a great shooter. He took the
same shots in the first half, but he
was leaning too much and he was
off.”

Suder thought that maybe his
scoring , binge hurt more than it
helped. “I hit those couple jumpers,”
said Suder, “and I think everyone
else started looking for that type of
shot, and we got out of our offense."

Was thisjust another loss in a lost
season for Duquesne? Not on your
life. “We wanted this one bad!" said
Farrell.

Suder agreed, saying, “We're ca-
pable of beating them, we just have
to play 40 minutes instead of 37 or
35."

Satalin and his team have a great
deal of doubt in the immediate
future. Satalin could have Sellers,
Compton, Stevenson, Harrison and
Harvey back next year along with
everybody but Farrell, or he could
get only Harvey back. Whatever and
whomever he gets, you can bet
they’ll be competitive. ’
