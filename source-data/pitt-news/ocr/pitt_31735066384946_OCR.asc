Rally
centers on
pornography
awareness  

By Erik Kridle and

Samuel Koda
The Pitt News

Mayor Sophie Masloff declared
Saturday, Sept. 10 as Pornogra-
phy Awareness Day in Pittsburgh.
The event featured speeches, ral-
lies and a parade, aimed at ac-
quainting citizens to the
problems with pornography.

”We’re not just talking about

dirty words and dirty pictures,”
Don Wildmon, founder and
president of the American Fami-
ly Association, said in an address
to a group of approximately 100
AFA supporters Saturday in the
Epiphany Catholic Church.
”You are talking about women

who suffer rape; you're talking -

about children who suffer child
abuse. It [pornography] breaks
down moral inhibitions. It causes
us to perpetrate crimes. ...”

Wildmon defined pornography
according to Webster's dic-
tionary.

”.Basically, today's Webster's
says it's writings and pictures
designed to sexually stimulate.”
But Wildmon added, ”There is
another side of pornography. It is
a lucrative business.”

Later in his speech, Wildmon
spoke of Martin Scorsese's con-

 Student leaders discuss

racial tensions at Pitt

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

Tension between all ethnic
groups must be evaluated, not
just those between blacks and
whites, according to Student
Government President Craig
Jackson and Black Action Socie-
ty Chairperson Celeste Myers,
who met Thursday to discuss ra-
cial tensions on the Pitt campus.

A representative from an Asian
group, which is not certified by
the university, was not present at
Thursday's meeting, contrary to
plans.

At the meeting, Jackson com-
mented that a quote that ap-
peared last week in The Pitt
News may have misrepresented
his views on racism.

In the article, Jackson said,

. ”Some racial incidents are not

unfounded.” Jackson explained
that he would like to clarify this
and said that he ”can understand
how people feel in certain in-
stances, but that can't be carried
to a whole race.”

Myers had commented that she

felt uncomfortable with Jackson's
comment but now understands
what he meant. »

When asked if she felt there is
a racial problem at Pitt, Myers
said, ”There is no doubt ingmy
mind that it does exist on cam-
pus, but it's very subtle.”

To the same question, Jackson
responded, ”It’s not something
you can just see, because it's not
like the level it was in the '60s.”

Myers added that she feels that
there is not a good intermix of
students on campus, in that
separate ethnic groups tend to
stick together and not interrelate.

Myers explained that difficul-
ties in mixing racially may arise
for students who come from a
segregated home atmosphere

into a large, ethnically diverse en— .
vironment like Pitt's. She said that T

the change can be difficult.

It is important, she said, that
people become educated about
ethnic differences so that stereo-
types are not allowed to develop.

Jackson and Myers both feel
that the most important thing to
accomplish is to know how the
university community feels about
racial relations. .

With the help of Dr. Jack L.
Daniel, assistant provost for Un-
dergraduate Programs, the SGB
and BAS will be distributing a sur-
vey to Pitt students aimed at rev-
ealing racial tensions.

The survey will specifically ask
students how they see racial re-
lations between other students,
students and faculty, students and
the minority community and
minorities in the classroom.

The questions in the survey will
be general in that no particular
race will be singled out.
However, participating students
will be asked about their own
ethnic backgrounds.

[Both group leaders said that if
results from the survey do point
to extensive racial tension, they

Palestinian

By Scot Ross

News Editor

Objecting to what has been
referredto as an apartheid—like
situation, approximately 75
people marched down Fifth
Avenue Friday, protesting the
Israeli treatment of Pales-
tinians.

The march, which ran from
the Islamic Center at 3339
Forbes Ave., up Bigelow
Boulevard, down Fifth Avenue
and eventually back to the
center, was aimed at making
Americans aware of the plight
of the more than 4.5 million
Palestinians subject to Israeli
occupation on the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.

According to information
published by the center, "|_The
Palestinians] cannot vote.
They are subject to arbitrary
arrest and torture. Everyday,

treatment protested

another farmer or another
house owner finds his land or
home confiscated by the Israe-
lis for ‘security’ reasons and
eventually bulldozed for a
new Israeli settlement.”.

The center claims that since
the election of Rabbi Meir Ka-
hane and Generals Sharon and
Eitan to the Knesset, who have
openly advised that the Pales-
tinians be driven out of Israel
with the use of violence, the
number of anti—Arab attacks
has increased.

Yusef Ali, who participated
in the march and described
himself as ”an American
citizen concerned with the
plight of the Palestinians,”
said, ”We would hope to
make [people] aware. We
would hope to eventually af-
fect the policies of the city
government, the state govern-
ment and, of course, the na-

tional government as it
concerns the whole Palestini-
an question and the rights of
the Palestinian people.

”I would like the [United
States government]/’ Ali said,
”to have a more equitable and
a more just position; that is, to
not just have a pro—|srae| posi-
tion regardless of ‘whatever
they may do or whatever
atrocities may be committed 
on both sides.”

He added that the U.S. J

government considers a vio-
lent act by the Arab side ”ter-
rorism” but deems similar
action by the Israelis as ”ap—
propriate behavior or human
rights behavior,” and that this
needs to stop.

The Islamic Center believes
that ”there will be no peace in
the Middle East until the rights
of the Palestinian people are
recognized and implemented."

Iraq use of chemical warfare raises new fears

Man Commits Suicide sey last year, Thomas said.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Iraq's
use of poison gas against its Kur-
dish minority is prompting con-
cern that other nations bogged
down in armed conflict might
resort to the ’’silent killer” in vio-
lation of a universally accepted
ban on use of chemical weapons.

According to U.S. officials,
there is little question that Iraq's
use of mustard gas against Irani-
an forces influenced Iran's deci-
sion to end their 8-year old
Persian. Gulf war last month.

Almost immediately after the
cease-fire took effect, ' Iraq
launched an offensive against its
Kurdish minority as suspected
collaborators with Iran. Tens of
thousands of Kurds were forced
to flee into southern Turkey.

Last week, about nine days af— ,

ter the first reports of Iraqi chem-
ical warfare began to circulate,
Secretary of State George P.
Shultz said he was convinced the
allegations were true.

Shultz accused the Iraqis of
”unjustifiable and abhorrent” be-
havior. The Senate ‘then unani-
mously approved stringent
economic sanctions against Iraq.

Iraq's minister of state for for-
eign affairs, Saddoun Hammadi,
met with Shultz on Thursday and
called the charges ”absolutely
baseless.” ‘

But well before the latest Iraqi
assault on the Kurds, a number of

rz. :-

United Nations investigations
concluded that Iraq —— and to a
lesser extent, Iran — had engaged
in chemical warfare since 1984.

Philly Scarfo trial
to begin this week

PHILADELPHIA (AP) —
Nicodemo Scarfo and 16 associ-
ates will go on trial this week on
charges that they conspired to
carry out a systematic and violent
series of crimes, including nine
murders, to make money and
perpetuate their power.

They are accused of plotting
four murders, shaking down drug
dealers and other criminals to
share in their illegal profits and
running gambling and loan-
sharking rackets.

But Scarfo and his associates
have scored major courtroom vic-

tories in the last nine months,

winning acquittals on murder and
drug charges.

The stakes are high for federal
prosecutors. ”From a morale
point of view, this is a very, very
significant trial,” said Frank Friel,

the head of the organized crime ,

intelligence division of the
Philadelphia Police Department.

The ‘defendants are being
prosecuted under the Racketeer

tions Act, which makes it a crime

Raid on radicals
yields explosives

TOKYO (AP) — Police seized
mortar launchers and more than
300 pounds of explosives in a
raid on a warehouse used by a
radical group, news reports said.

The warehouse, on the out-

skirts of Niigata city, 160 miles
northwest of Tokyo, was rented
by the radical Chukakuha group
in the name of a construction
company, the Kyodo News Serv-
ice reported.
- The group has claimed respon-
sibility in recent years for attacks
on Tokyo's Narita airport, the
U.S. Yokota Air Base and Osaka
police headquarters.

, Kyodo quoted unidentified
police sources as saying the ex-
plosives found Saturday included
330 pounds of potassium chlo-
ride, a chemical used in making
explosive materials, and mortar
launchers that had not been as-
sembled yet.

Police believe the group has
about 5,000 members.

EFFORT, Pa. (AP) ~ A Roma-
nian man killed his estranged
wife and her mother and then
shot himself with a .38—caliber
handgun, the Monroe County
coroner said Sunday.

Nicolae Vutca, about 48, of
Parsippany, N.J., shot himself in
the head after fatally shooting his
estranged wife, Dorina, 45, twice
in the head and his mother-in-
law, Maria Vacariu, 65, once in
the head, coroner Robert M. Al-
len said.

Allen said Vutca was not a U.S.
citizen and there was no identifi-
cation available to determine his
precise age. .

The three bodies were found
Friday inside the home of Alex
and Elizieta Miricea, of rural Ef-
fort, Monroe County deputy
coroner David Thomas said. -The
dead women had been staying
with the Miricea family since Au-
gust, when the couple separated,
according to Thomas.

”Apparently it (double murder-
suicide) was the result of his es-
trangement with his wife and the
problems they were having,” Al-
len said. » ‘

Ms. Vutca had obtained a

The baby was not harmed.

The Miriceas left the baby with

NewAdd/Drop system Racism

’receives mixed reviews

By Rich Cholodofsky

Staff Writer

An attempt was made to make
add/drop and registration easier,
faster and more comfortable for
students.

0 Add/drop, which ends tomor-
row, is the first real test for the
new system since being initiated
in mid-June.

The system, which used to con-
sist of class cards that had to be
pulled individually, now operates
on an on-line computer system.

Now, when a class is dropped,
it immediately becomes available
for another student to pick up.

The other major change in the
system was the office's relocation
from C3 to G1 in Thackery Hall.

”The switch is an attempt to

cmake the line more comforta-
ble,” said Assistant Registrar
David Carmen.

’’It gives the students a chance
to sit instead of standing in line.”

The student enters G1 to be
checked in at one of the two
desks at the front of the room to
have his or her clerical work
taken care of.

After being checked in, the
add/drop slip is taken from the
student, who then goes and takes
a seat until being called over to
one of the desks.

”The new system is better for
both parties. For the most part, it
will be better for the students.
Hopefully, it will be more per-
sonal and comfortable,” Carmen
said. '

”The system can check class al-
ternatives. This way, the opera-
tors can show, on the screen,
what's available and let students
pick and choose,” he said.

The new system also features a
student inquiry terminal which
students can use to check the sta-
tus of classes.

”We are still getting our feet
wet. Both parties are going
through an acclimation process.

”We’ve gotten a lot of compli-
ments,” said Carmen.

The system change has been
received with mixed reactions
from those who have gone
through add/drop. T

”l think it's a lot better because
it is more personal. There is final-
ly a place to sit down. It's also
faster,” said David Ludwig, a Pitt
junior.

’’It is a better system, but more _

improvements need to be done,”
he said.

Pitt sophomore Leigh Jacob
said, ’’It is not as efficient as last
yean

Jacob, who waited in line over

an hour, said, ”The waiting in the,

line and the sitting down takes a
lot of time. You sacrifice time for
efficiency.”

Freshman Jamie Kazacos said,
”From what I hear, it's better.
They know whether a course is
full right away.” 8

Maureen Hopbell, a Pittjunior,
said, ”lt’s OK. I don’t_ know if it's
any faster. You get in the door
and you think you are at the head

are not certain as to what their
next step should be.

Jackson said, ’’I’d like to see
some kind of open forum, but I'm
afraid of it becoming some kind
of bitch session where you get the
radicals from all the sides dis-
criminating [against] each other.
Then it's worse than when you
started.”

Jackson said that he did not
know whether the 5GB had ever
attempted a program aimed at
improving racial relations, but
that ”now is the time to deal with
it."

Myers said she does not know
what to do if survey results point

to racial problems.

She explained that she is a Resi-
dent Assistant and that she invit-
ed all people on her ﬂoor, as well
as throughout the residence halls,
to come to a ”get acquainted”
picnic sponsored by the BAS.

”This is my opportunity to let
my students, on my floor and
throughout the residence halls,
know that anyone is encouraged
and is welcome to attend any of
our programs,” said Myers.

Myers added that white people
are permitted and are welcome in
the BAS. She said that she does
not know whether there are any
whites in the BAS at the moment
because the membership is quite

extensive and because members
are not asked about their race
when joining.

A final draft of the survey is ex-
pected to be completed by Fri-
day, with distribution to begin the
following week, according to
Jackson.

-Myers said that she plans to
give the surveys out at all up-
coming BAS events.

Jackson said that he would like
to see the evaluation of the sur-
veys completed by October. He
added that, to make the survey
statistically correct, he would like
to see response from 10 to 12
percent of all of Pitt's under-
graduates.

Auction
held for

athletics

By Marc Duchin
Editor in Chief

Pitt alumni and other guests
paid hundreds of dollars for
items ranging from computers
to football jerseys at the Pitt
Golden Panthers Auction,
held Saturday night at the Wil-
liam Pitt Union.

The event lasted approxi-
mately seven hours and each
guest was charged $35 a din-
ner plate for an opportunity to
bid on donated items includ-
ing Pitt merchandise and spe-
cial trips.

According to Golden Pan-
thers Auction Chairman Ray
Cappelli, all money raised will
assist in increasing the number
of endowed athletic
scholarships.

”We hope to make it an an-
nual event,” said Cappelli.
”We haven't had it for two
years and now we started it up
again.”

"In addition to a live auction,
guests participated in a silent
auction and a ”Ba|loon Sale”
earlier in the evening. The bal-
Ioon sale offered guests a
chance to win valuable items
by purchasing $25, $50 or
$100 balloons. The highest
purchase in the silent auction
reached $1,600 for a cellular
telephone valued at $2,000.
Some bids dropped as low as
$10.

. Other items sold in the silent
auction included a $260 pur-
chase of former Pitt football
star Hugh Green's retired jer-
sey and a $340 private tailgate
party for 25 people at the

Pitt/Notre Dame game. Form-

er Steeler quarterback Terry
Bradshaw's game jersey was
sold for $225 and teammate
Joe Green's game jersey went
for $210.

In the live auction, former
Pitt quarterback Dan Marino’s
retired jersey was sold for
$500. Also, a dinner for six
people at the home of Pitt
head basketball coach Paul
Evans was purchased for $
1,000 by Pitt alumnus Dr. Jim
Barber.

”I’ve been a Pitt fan all my
life,” said Barber, class of '71.
’’I’m a plastic surgeon by trade
and I used to listen to Pitt
games long distance from Los
Angeles on the phone."

Jack Conners, Pitt class of
'59, said he enjoyed the auc-
tion's ”personal_ things” the
most. ”Col|ector’s items,
coaches’ items, the things no
one can afford,” he said.

Cappelli explained that the
endowment of scholarships’ is
important for the access of
funds for various athletic
programs.

’’All this money [raised by
the auction] is put into a bank
account, and it's invested in
other ways,” he said. ”The in-
terest out of that money funds
the scholarship. It's just
another method to pay for a
scholarship, like we give a
football player. This enables
other money that is normally
provided for scholarships for
athletes to be freed, to put
money in to programs to fur-
ther the [athletic]‘ program.”

”I was amazed with all the crit-

Hopbell, who waited about 45
minutes, said that on one occai-

office opened, and she only wait-
ed 20 minutes.

”Coming early is your best

er, found the statement in the ear-
ly part of the film, that it does not
represent the historic Christ, to be
offensive.

Although he admits he won't
see the movie, Baily said that he
doesn't need to view it to ”know
that it is wrong.

”I don't think you could do that
about anyone else in this culture
and get away with it,” noted
Baily. ”You couldn't take any po-
litical, business, ethnic or reli-
gious leader and put a film up
using his name, then in the begin-
ning have a disclaimer and say
‘this is only one man's artistic im-
pression.’ "

 

The meeting was held prior to
a motorcade through Downtown,
intended by the AFA to focus at-
tention on the hazardous effects
of pornography.

The 11 a.m. motorcade, offi-
cially recognized and endorsed
by Mayor Sophie Masloff, was
composed of AFA members and
other religious opponents of por-
nography.

Although 1,500 to 2,000
demonstrators were expected for
the procession, the Pittsburgh
Police Traffic Division later
reported that approximately
1,000 turned out.

Singing ”Amazing Grace” and

’’Battle Hymn of the Republic,”
the participants carried placards
condemning pornogrphy, as well
as abortion and drug use.

Charlie Shufelt, parade mar-
shal, said the way to deal with
pornography is through its
sponsors.

’’If they [sponsors] insist on
promoting things that the com-
munity feels is morally reprehen-
sible —— bad for the community,
bad for children — we'll just sim-
ply stop buying their products.”

Shufelt called The Last Temp-
tation of Christ ”an instance of
pornography.”

Racism inthe ’BOs
in danger of growing

Last week, members of the Black Action Society and the Stu-

. dent Government Board met to discuss the extent of racial.ten-

sion on campus.

As a result of that meeting, the two groups have decided to
issue a survey aimed at divining students’ feelings about racism.

Ideally, the survey would show that the perceived tension be-
, tween different racial and minority groups would be shown to

be nothing more than a huge misunderstanding, that the years
of subjugation and then alienation between-the races was sim-

ply the result of historical feelings unjustly transferred to the

current generation.

Ideals, though, are almost by definition impossible.

It seems that a better description of the situation at Pitt would
be considerably ‘less favorable to the majority of students. There
is very little new terrain to. be covered in the discussion of ra-
cism since thé“i"i/videspreadl civilrights movements of the '40s
and '50s. During those periods, the questions of racism were
so clearly defined, so painfully obvious,ithat any progress was
major, and any gained ground was newsworthy. - V

Presently, however, there has been something of a codifica-
tion of thought about racism.

The modern incarnations of yesteryear’s racists point to af-
firmative action programs as evidence that the reversal of dis-
crimination has gone too far. There are students on campus who

will in one breath claim to be free of racial prejudice, and in v

the next profess a desire that another group — blacks, whites,
Asians, anything - would just wake up as well. Racism in the
'80s is not the pronounced set of animosities it was earlier in
this century. Now, it is a subtle set of differences that can only
eat away at the tenuous progress made thus far.

The record number of charges
filed aga_inst Margaret Kelly
Michaels for sexual abuse of chil-
dren, I 15, has focused our atten-
tion on a problem many have
chosen to ignore.

Every now and then, we are
forced to examine the ramifica-
tions of what occurs when a par-
ent's worst fear is confirmed, that

his or her child has been sexual- ‘

ly abused.

In the enigmatic case of
Michaels, what remains in ques-
tion are several things, the fore-
most being, did she actually
commit these crimes? Doctors are
asking if possessing the capacity
to commit such offenses
precludes having been diagnosed
with a mental illness, and I'm
wondering —— if what prosecutors
have convinced the judge of was
correct — how she could have
been privy to such a relatively

large number of exorbitant activi-
ties without being discovered for
four days after she terminated her
employment?

While evidence for or against
a child abuser has been more
clear—cut in other cases, what

makes that of Michaels so unique
is the fact that witnesses to the tri-
al seem to be either totally con-
vinced of her guilt or have serious
doubts of it -— leaving no serious
”middle ground” except that
created by the media forum.
For 20 children to corroborate
a ”story," we'd have to take into
account that the whole story is
that Michaels did bad things to
children. But on the other hand,

Dressing for the electrician

I was playing tennis when I was
called off the court by my wife.
She said excitedly over the
phone, ”The electrician is com-
ing in an hour.”

”He’s been saying that for a
month. Why should we believe
him now?”

”Because he initiated the call.
I know he'll be here. It's a feel-
ing I have.”

When I arrived at the house,
my wife was dusting furniture

and fixing the flowers. ”You bet—.

put on a shirt and tie. I don't want
him to think we can't afford
him.”

”But he's only an electrician,”
I protested.

”He’s more than that. He's the
key to our entire fuse box
problem. Something has been
blowing every electric appliance
in the house, and I'm not going
to take itanymore.” '

I showered and put on my best
dressshirt and Italian silk tie, plus
the blue blazer I save for British
royalty and American workmen.

My wife was chilling a bottle of
wine. ’’I hope he likes Pouilly

truth? Or, if nothing actually hap-
pened, could I have been
coerced into making up a story

It would be like a big game.

I remember a time when I was
in fourth grade -— I would have

”bad kid" in the class of bringing
itching powder to school. The
teacher reprimanded him right
away, and after he was out of the
room, she began to ask the rest

”If he doesn't like us he'll walk

want him to know that we be-

don't want to lose an electrician

”What do you discuss with an
electrician?” I asked.
”Benjamin Franklin. After all,
he was the father of electricity.

I Then there was Thomas Edison.

Electricians all think Edison is the
cat's meow.” I

, ”I could talk» to him about the
stock market,” I said. ”I under-
stand anyone who is a licenced
electrician automatically be-

lied, because I wanted to itch,
too.

I've also observed this desire to
”agree with the other kids” in my
9-year-old cousin. She, like her
peers, has been instilled with so
much information from relatives,
educators and television that she
often has a difficult time deciding
what is the right thing to do.

However, this scope of infor-
mation, as endless as it is, has
been far too narrow, just enough
to put a squeeze on our children;
but this mental vise does not al-
low for adequate dissemination
of information. That is, not until
the vise is wound too tight and it
snaps do we realize what the
problem is.

are certain people who should

My wife said, ”I’m so nervous.
It's been so long since I met a
man who works with pliers.”

”Be your natural self,” I told‘

her. ”An electrician puts on his
pants one leg at a time, just like
the plumber.”

”I’d feel better ifl had cleaned
the basement."

”You’re worrying too much. I I

wouldn't be surprised if, after he
knocks off the bottle of Pouilly

guess we should consider it an
honor that he would even stop at
our house,” shesaid. ”Do you
think we should call the Larri-
mores? They have been waiting
for an electrician for four years.”

”That would be rubbing it in;
Besides, I'm not sure they would
know how to behave in front-of
a licensed electrician. For all we
know, they would fall to their
knees and make damn fools of
themselves.”

consequences of such actions to
the best of their comprehensive
ability? When games are put on
the market for children to play,
warning them against the dangers
they may face, how can it possi-
bly fail to make it all seem like a
big game?

When we engage in such
”preventive” tactics as that, are
we tapping the root of the
problem or merely shaking the
leaves on the tree‘?

One of the things I did not like
about the Michaels trial was that
the children were all were inter-

It will be interesting to see how
child abuse cases are handled in
the future.

I am not convinced either way,

This past weekend, the Pitt
women's volleyball team was
soundly defeated by three of the
elite teams in the sport.

Playing in the inaugural
Regional Challenge Cup, the
Lady Panthers were defeated by
the third—ranked University of Pa-
cific on Friday evening by a score
of 15-6, 15-7 and 15-3.

On Saturday, Pitt ran smack
into eighth-ranked BYU and the
sixth-ranked University of Texas
team.

Grossman,

Despite a stronger performance
against tournament host BYU
than exhibited the night before
against Pacific, the women from
Pitt came up on the short end of
a 15-4, 15-7_ and 15-6 match.

Turning up their intensity a
notch higher was of no avail for
the Lady Panthers. Despite out-
digging the Lady Longhorns from

Defensive end Burt Grossman
has been one of the most consis-
tent starters for Pitt over the last
two years.

Each of the last two seasons,
Grossman finished with 80 tack-
les. Last season, he was named
‘second-team All-East by the As-
sociated-Press and a first-team
ECAC All-Star.

’’I feel much better coming into
this season than I have for any
other season since I've been
here,” said Grossman.

Against Northern Iowa two
weeks ago, Grossman led the
defense with nine tackles and
two-and-a-half sacks. He kept the
UNI offense off-balance all day.

How did Grossman feel after
that first game?

”Uh,‘ sore,” Grossman
laughed, ”No, really, I do feel
pretty good.

”The game was sort of a lopsid-
ed victory. We had a lot of ques-
tion marks on defense. You can't
get those questions answered un-
less you put them in a game situ-
ation. We got a lot oflmistakes
out of the way, but as far as a real
test, we'll have to see this week
[against Ohio State].”

Being an older member of a
young defense, Grossman will be
counted on as a team leader.

here for four years, so he has to

Heinz Pak is 21 years old, tall,
blond, thin, a Pittsburgh native
and an extremely strong left-
footed kicker. Mark Mostinckx is
26 years old, stocky, was born in
Brussels, Belgium, and is a strong
right-footed kicker. Pak has
played mostly in America, while
Mostinckx has toured throughout
Europe.

If it sounds like the two new
guys on the Panther soccer team
are polar opposites, well, they
are. However, both men will be
of extreme importance on the
offensive line as the first game,
against Slippery Rock, ap-

Mike Gottfried said. ”He’s got the

‘playing experience, and he

knows the defense as well as any-
one. So we're going to be look-
ing for big things from him this
season.”

Grossman realizes this will be -

a big part of his game this season,
but he doesn't want to have the
notion of leadership to hold him
down.

”If I am considered a leader,
then that's great,” Grossman said.
”I just want to do my best to help
the team and keep us on top. If
being a leader is the way I can
help out, then that's the way it
Is.”

Grossman is from Bala Cyn-
wyd, Pa., and attended Arch-
bishop Carroll High School. In
1985, his senior year, Grossman
had the second-best shot-put
throw in the nation of 63 feet 9
inches.

This season, Grossman was
awarded the Glenn ”Pop” Warn-
er Award as the most valuable
defensive lineman during spring
practice. The preseason awards
didn't stop there.i

He was named a first team
preseason All—American by the
NFL Draft Report, which also list-
ed Grossman as the highest rat-
ed defensive end in the nation —

Athlon All-East team. The Sport-

Both players are patient, artic-

swering questions — traits which
are directly related to their play-
ing style.

Coach Joe Luxbacher hopes to
utilize these valuable characteris-
tics to create a more patient,
thoughtful and effective offensive
line.

Both Pak and Mostinckx trans-
ferred from Community College
of Allegheny County this year,
and Mostinckx is quick to point
out the advantages of a soccer
program at a large university.

decided disadvantage from the

fort, Frawley was unable to per-

”Denise was personally disap-
pointed that she was unable to
perform at 100 percent for her
team. The illness hampered her
play and concentration against
other All-American candidates,’-’
said Pitt coach Shelton Collier.

Additionally, Pitt has a relative-
ly inexperienced lineup replacing

As Collier noted, ”A lot of our
players are not used to playing
major roles against nationally

Despite the losses, the Pitt
coach was grateful that his team
was able to participate in a tour-
nament with a Final Four-type at-
mosphere.

When asked to, comment on
the Lady Panther’s play in the
tournament, Collier commented,
”We are making a great effort,
but our play has been inconsis-
tent. The level of play exhibited
by the other teams in the tourna-

ment is nothing we can't match
on our side of the net, but the
other teams did it consistently.”

Though disappointed by his
team's performance, the Pitt,
coach was afforded the opportu-
nity to try a number of lineups,
as well as trya lot of players in
different roles in an effort to so-
lidify his team for the future. He
is hoping his team has emerged
from the tournament with a
lineup he can use for the rest of
the season.

to zero against Nebraska and
then won 24 matches in a row."

able starters and both are confi-

Healthy Mulvihill an asset to an
otherwise young volleyball team

By Ed Kuznik

For The Pitt News

With her 1987 volleyball sea-
son cut short due to injury, Pitt
senior Nora Mulvihill is looking
to come back with a vengeance
in her last year of play on the col-
legiate court.

Mulvihill and Denise Frawley
are the only seniors left from last
year's 37-6 NCAA Tournament
squad. The 1984 Norwin High
School graduate occupies the
middle-blocker position for the
Lady Panthers.

In high school, she was a mem-
ber of ”Vo|leyba|l Monthly’s Elite
Fabulous 50" (a compilation of
the top 50 players in the country),
and has carried that level of play
to Pittsburgh, being named an
All-Big East selection in 1986.

Mu|vihil|’s success story start-
ed IO years ago when she decid-
ed to get on the Norwin
volleyball bandwagon. At the
time, the Knights were the premi-
er team in Pennsylvania, so she
found it to become
motivated.

easy

Mulvihill blossomed into one
of the most sought-after players in
the United States her senior year.
She narrowed her college choices
to Pitt and Penn State, and when
the time for the decision came,
Pitt coach Shelton Collier and the
university's nursing program won
out over Happy Valley.

Mulvihill stated, ”He con-
vinced me that I could have a
nursing major and play here.
He's gone out of his way for me
ever since; he’lI sign me out late
so I can get in all my classes. I
came here because I felt Shelton
really cared about his players.”

Mulvihill had a great sopho-
more season at Pitt and was well
on her way to having her best
season ever in '88 before the in-
jury bug hit. She went down mid-
season with a severely sprained
ankle and was out for over six
weeks.

Needless to say, a huge chunk
of her season was taken away,
probably costing her several post-
season honors. Mulvihill plans to
make up for that time this season.

’’I thought I was playing well
before the injury,” she said. ”I
don't think I contributed much af-
terwards, even though I did play
in the last few matches.

”But I've hail a good off-
season. My ankles are holding up
well and I didn't have to get sur-
gery when I thoughtl might have
to. We worked well in rehab.”

Things appear to be straight-
ened out in her life in '88, and
both Collier and Mulvihill realize
how crucial her presence on the
court will be.

”This season she's come in
great shape,” Collier said. ”If
we're really going to be success-
ful and gain a national ranking,
a lot depends on how well Nora

plays.”

”I want us to win the Big East,”
Mulvihill added. ’’I want to try
and lead by playing well and by
example.”

If that can indeed happen, who
knows how far Pitt can climb the
volleyball ladder?‘

Nebraska
shocked by

Bruins in
41-28 loss

By Hillel ltalie

Associated Press Writer

A hot first quarter left UCLA
coach Terry Donahue with a
warm feeling.

”The fans were on fire, the
team was on fi re; everything was
clicking, everything was work-
ing,” Donahue said after the
Bruin 42-28 win.

”That was the best quarter of
football I've seen in my tenure at
UCLA,” said Donahue, who
earned his 100th victory since be-
coming the Bruins’ head coach in
1976.

Troy Aikman threw three first-

’Skins defeat   Steelers,
30-29, on last-minute
field goal by Lohmiller

By David Ginsburg

AP Sports Writer

WASHlNCTON — The Pitts-
burgh Steelers didn't make the
kind of mistakes that show up in

the box score, but their effort

against the Washington Redskins
left Coach Chuck Noll complain-
ing about his young team's
numerous miscues.

Steelers quarterback Bubby
Brister had a second week
without an interception.‘ Pitts-
burgh amassed only 24 yards in
penalties and fumbled only once.
But that wasn't good enough to
stop. the Steelers from absorbing
a 30-29 setback at the hands of
the defending Super Bowl
champions.

’’If you want to be a champion-
ship football team, you have to
eliminate the mistakes we
made,” Noll said. ”We couldn't
afford them  we had some

a coverage errors. We had some

protection errors.”

6 One of the boo-boos will sim-

ply read ”kick failed” in the scor— V

ing summary. But when Harry
Newsome couldn't handle Mike
Webster's bouncing snap on a
conversion, Pittsburgh missed
what turned outito be an impor-
tant extra point. ’

”There’s no excuse for that. I
just didn't execute,” said the
36-year-old Webster. ”You prac-
tice that [for] 15 years...”

Gary Anderson, who kicked
three field goals but never got a
chance to put his foot to that ill-
fated conversion, said, ’’It always
seems that when you miss one
extra point it has a way of getting
back at you. And, of course, this
one did."

Brister had nothing to be em-

barrassed about after completing
12 of 28 passes for 258 yards and
two touchdowns. He also ran for
a score on a third-and-goal play
from the Redskin 6-yard line.

”Brister’s play was fine,” Noll

said. ”He came up with the big .

plays and did a good job.”

Said Brister: ”Coming into the
game, you'd have thought 29
points would have been pretty
good for us. We executed our
game plan like we worked it all.
week.” »

Wide receiver Louis Lipps

caught three passes for 98 yards,

and his score on an 80-yard play

marked his first touchdown since '

December 1986. He had only 11
receptions last year after battling
a hamstring injury, and he al-
ready has seven catches this
season.

His touchdown came midway
through the second quarter after
he faked out Pro Bowl corner-
back Darrell Green and then
caught a Brister pass in stride
along the right sideline.

”We knew we could make

some big plays on them, and we \

did,” Lipps said. ”That’s one part
of the game we didn't’ want to
come up short on.”

While the Pittsburgh offense

.1 came up with its. share of pivotal ,

plays, the defense didn't. The
Steelers had only one sack and al-
lowed Washington quarterback
Doug Williams enough time to
accumulate 430 passing yards.

”We had a hard time getting
pressure on Williams," ac-
knowledged Noll.

”We played hard but didn't
make the big plays we needed to
win,” added cornerback Rod
Woodson. *

2 country.

”He is a lot more mature this
year,” Gottfried said. ”He has
played well here in the past, and
we'll need even more from him
this year.”

Grossman doesn't see the
revamping of the defense as
much of a problem.

”We are a little young, but we
have a lot of good people here,"
Grossman said. ’’I think we can
be just as good as last season.”

Some players like playing
weaker teams, like UNI, for the

V first game to get some of the mis-

takes worked out. Grossman
agrees with this, but only to ‘a
point.

”For a really young team, play-
ing a weaker team will help
everyone out,” Grossman said.
”Everybody makes mistakes, and
against a weaker team you can
make up for them. But overall, I
think, everybody on the team
likes playing against harder op-
ponents.”

But when opponents line up
against Grossman and his team-
mates, they may wish they were
playing Northern Iowa.

you don't always have the play-
ers and that kind of soccer can
tire a team out very fast.”

Mostinckx has been back play-
ing competitive soccer for two
years. Previously, he sustained an
injury to his shinbone which re-
quired surgery and kept him out
of action for a while.

Pak, being a natural left—footer,
is a hot commodity on any offen-
sive line and admits this unique
trait is a major contributing fac-
tor as to why he will probably
start.

”The tendency in soccer is that
most players are right—footed. Fac-
ing a |eft—footed kicker, the goalie

is not sure where the ball is go-
ing to go. With a right—footed
player, you can figure out where
the ball is going because goalies
play against them in practice all
the time.”

There is absolutely nothing
conventional about a left-footed
shot. The ball rotation is different,
and the angle at which the ball
approaches the goal is different
whether the shot is from the left
or the right side of the field.

Both Pak and Mostinckx are
optimistic about Panther soccer
this season. ’’I hope we win the
Big East and beat Seton Hall

[ranked fourth last year],” Pak’

said. ’’I think we have the team

to do it.”

Mostinckx, coming off a suc-
cessful season at CCAC, said, ”I
really think we have a team that
can force something this year. I
think we're going to have a good
season and hopefully, we'll do a
lot for Pitt soccer.”

This year, Luxbacher’s squad is
solid and loaded with talent, but
still fairly young. Pak and
Mostinckx have a good deal of
high—level playing experience be-
tween them and should bring pa-
tience and maturity to the field.
They may prove to be the key in-
gredients in Luxbacher’s formu-
la for success.
