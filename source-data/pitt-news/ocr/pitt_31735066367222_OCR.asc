Chancellor Gives Talk;

Hot Issue

Charges and
c h a r g e s‘ were abundantly
voiced as the Monday meeting
of the Senate heard argu-
ments for and against the
eviction of the Pershing Riﬂes
Organization from its offices in
the Student Union. -

Dick Moriarity, president of the
Student Union Board, reiterated
the opinion of the Board that the
Rifles did not carry on sufficient
activities to merit the full—time
use of its office.

“We have two criteria to guide
our decisions in allocating office
space,” Moriarity said. “The ﬁrst
is ‘What is the room actually be-
ing used for?’ and the second is

‘What has been the past conduct‘:

of an organization in the build-
inga-?n

It was alleged by Moriarity that «

members of the Rifles had used
the office to play cards and thus
break a University regulation.
In a previous statement, Com-
mander Engel of the organiza-
tion in question had said that
his; unit was not well informed
concerning SU regulations. Mo-
riarity fpetaliated by stating that
the rules the building are
7:/1'itte1'1;,}‘gnievery lease which is
signedU?by,._ office occupants.

In further discussion, Moriarity
said that Major Banks of the
ROTC staff had assured him that
facilities would be made avail-
able to the riflemen in the Cathe-
dral if they were evicted.

Engel retorted that the afore-
mentioned Major had told him
that there was absolutely no space
available in the Cathedral.

‘Moriarity then said that tem-

porary ofﬁce facilities will be

afforded in the SU for Pershing

Riﬂes in the event of their evic-

tion.

The Senate recommended that
the defendants be permitted to
appeal the eviction decision be-
fore the Student Union Board.
But the consensus of the Senate
was that Board decisions are ﬁnal
oniquestions of office space allo-
cations.

The Senate also approved a
resolution to have TV sets sup-

/plied" in University recreational

K areas for World Series viewing.

The sets will be placed in the
Hunt Room and Tuck Shop.

Also at the meeting, the Uni-
versity’s Health Service for res-
ident students came under sharp

Kennedy Runs Ahead of Nixon InPoll

By BARRIER A. VVEHNER

Senator John F. Kennedy holds
a solid lead over Vice President
Nixon, according to voting opin-
ions of Pitt students polled last
Wednesday.

The question asked at this first
of a series of weekly polls was “If
the presidential election was held
today for which candidate would
you vote?”

Fifty-five per cent of the cross
section of the student population
polled gave their support to the
Kenn_edy—Johnsor’1 ticket, while 43
per cent supported the Nixon-
Lodge ticket and two per cent
were undecided.

, Weekly Polls

Each week student interviews,

under the direcigron of ,,the_ Pro-

gram for Practical Political Edu-
cation, will poll a different sample
of the Pitt student population.
The results will be carried in each
Wednesday’s edition of the Pitt
News.

Parental choices, as indicated
by students polled, were ob-
tained from a question on the
family voting behavior. There
was almost an even split be-
tween the two parties——37 per
cent for the Kennedy-Johnson
ticket and 36 per cent for the
Nixon-Lodge ticket-

Fifteen per cent of the students
polled replied that they were un-
decided, and 12 per cent didn’t
know what their parents choice
would be.

The majority of students in-

terviewed ranked foreign policy,
national defense and the domestic
economy as the most important
issues in the 1960 election. Reli-
gion was mentioned by only a
few students. as being signiﬁcant.

Liberal Arts undergraduates
demonstrated the greatest Ken-
nedy support, 85 per cent, com-
pared to a professional and
graduate school high of 63 per
cent for Nixon. In general, Ken-
nedy support poll tended to in-
crease in relation to years of
college.

Other breakdowns showed that
58 per cent of the male students
favored Kennedy, and Nixon was
favored by the female students by
the same margin.

This annual address to the en-
tire University body, symbolizes
the central intellectual purpose
of the University. The topic of
the chancellor’s address has not
been released. ‘

Dr. John Geise, assistant chan-
cellor of student affairs, said,\“I
feel confident that all members
of the University Community will
want to hear Dr. Litchﬁeld's an-
nual address.

“Those who have heard his pre-
vious reports to the student body
have always felt a sense of par-
ticipation in the vast development"
taking place within the Univer-
sity.”

Last year, Dr. Litchfield’s ad-
dress, “Reflections of a Chang-
ing Time,” dealt with the ad-
vancements the University has
made and revealed to elevate it
to an even higher academic level.

Some administrative offices will
be closed in order to give staff
members an opportunity to attend
the program.

In addition to the Fall Convo-
cation, the Honors Convocation in
the Spring and the Graduation _in
June are also annual ceremonial
events which symbolize the basic
intellectual purpose of the Uni-
versity. .

Executive Board
Announces Rally

For Miami Game.

Chuck Isler, president of the
student body, announced at Mon-
day’s executive meeting that a pep
rally is planned for Friday in the
quadrangle at 7:30 p.m.

“Although the Michigan State

game was well supported, the
team needs some momentum to
get going,” he said. “That momen-
tum can come from a successful
and well-attended rally.”
1 “The lack of enthusiasm is a
problem here,” Isler said. Mem-
bers of the executive committee
feel that fraternities and sorori-
ties are not lending enough sup-
port ‘to the rallies.

In order to offset V" major ob-

‘jections, "the time for the rally

was set late enough so as not to
interfere with the dinner hour and
early enough not to interfere with
the evening's activities.

According to Isler, there is not
much cheering from the student
section, outside Block “P.” “There
are students who want to cheer at
the games,” Isler said, “but the
apathy displayed by many others
discourages them.”

No cars will be premitted in
the quadrangle during the rally.

To start with, every Corvair has a l>1nlget-
pleasing price tag. And (.}orvair goes on
from there to save you even more. With
extra miles per gallon . . . quicl\'er—tlnan-
ever cold-start warmup so you start saving
sooner . . . a new extra-_cost optional
heater that warms everyone evenly. Riding
along with this extra economy: more room
inside for you, more room up front for
your luggage (sedans and coupes have
almost 12% more usable trunk space).

And our new wagons? You’ll love them——-
think they’re the greatest. thing for
families since houses. The Lakewood
Station Wagon does a mar)-sized job with
cargo, up to 68 cubic feet of it. The Cretan-
brier Sports Wagon you’re going to have
to see—it gives you up to 175.5 cubic
feet of space for you and your things.

Corvair’s whole thrifty lineup gets its pep
from a ‘spunkier 14:5-cu.-in. air-cooled rear
engine. Same rear-engine traction, same
smooth 4-wheel independent-suspension
ride. See the polished and reﬁned 1961
Corvair first chance you get at your
Chevrolet dealer’s.

 

Spare tire is in the rear in coupes and

front.

Graduate students at the University are ﬁnally beginning
totunite and do somehting for themselves. Under the leader-
'ship'of  Putnam Jones, dean of the graduate faculty-, and
a psychology graduate, Forrest Jewell, a committee—form
of government is being instituted whereby graduates will
be able to take an activeinterest in the University.

m  'A former plan started just last Fall has been abandoned
because of lack ofinterest, but the present system should
work because only students willing to Volunteer will be
lnicharge. - ' ‘ ‘

, The group will have no immediate constitution, be-
cause, Jewell said, he would rather see ‘an organization
that really exists ‘than one on paper. ’ I A
~ It will be of great beneﬁt to the University if the grad-
iuiates are able to forma coalition. to present their problems
p s a block. ' I

 I Almost.4000 graduate students, not including those in
pthe-professional schools, are studying here at Pitt. There
.is dgﬁnitely a need for an organization to present the
‘graduates’ problems to the administration, and to’ offer a
wocial program. I L _
. This new form of government perhaps will be the
answer. It will contain ﬁve committees, the main one be-
ing for-the speciﬁc purpose of improving graduate rela-
tions. It will concern itself with such problems as inter-
departmental communication and teacher evaluation.

1 This committee will also seek a lounge similar to the
Tuck Shop where graduates may congregate and discuss
the more important issues of the day. .

Another committee of importance is the social com-
. ‘mittee. Thisigroup would plan dances, parties, and other
9, social functionsspeciﬁcally for graduate students.

I Students who have worked in organizing this govern-
ment should be commended for their interest in the welfare
pf theigraduates. ’

Hopefully, their fellow students. will actively support
the program which has been so greatly needed for a number
of; years. “ . '

Now comes the.surprise.
in. the smaller stadium shows

I, aboutithree times as much school

spirit, support. and énthusiasm
as its larger counterpart. \

By this time you are probably
asking yourself “what does this
_prove.?” '

The answer is very simple:
the average high school cheer-
ing section shows less “apathy”,
and more school “spirit”‘than
does the entire University of
Pittsburgh student body.

The words “apathy” and “spirit” have become
serious problems at the University.
would like to reprint a portion of an article from.
the September 28 Pitt News which quoted Dr.
Ronald Pease..of the Dean of Me4i’s Ofﬁce as
saying: “There were more band members than stu-

dents at last Friday’s pep rally.”

on to advise the University Senate to concern
itself with the lack of “spirit” and “apathy” among

Pitt students.
Shift the Blame

There will undoubtedly be some who will blame
it on the weather, police, greased goal—posts, home-

work, or some other reason.

Letters to

‘Core Agreement’ ‘
Found Ridiculous
Editor;\The Pitt'News:

With surprise and irritation I,

read in The Pitt News an Article
on the Core Agreement. Permit
me to repeat it:

“I AGREE that I will not give ‘

or receive assistance during ‘an
examination.

I FURTHER AGREE I shall‘
advise the instructor in charge if
I observe others giving or re-
ceiving assistance during an ex-
amination. _ ~

‘fl STAND with‘ the core group

in this agreement.”

This poorly written statement
is absurd. I cannot understand
how such a thing ever got start-
ed. _ .

Perhaps it’s the« result of the
investigation conducted by a
well—known ‘Pitt student in
search of the methods and ex-
tent of cheating on campus. (He
probably failed to learn how to
cheat). If the Core Agreement
is the result of such dragon-
hunting, the investigator is truly
a ranking disciple of McCarthy--
Joe, not Charlie.

Or perhaps the‘ Core» Agree-

ment is just an attempt to in-

, stitute an‘ honor ‘system at Pitt
(whatever good that is). If so,
its author, is probably just one
of those well-meaning persons
whose exuberance has flown out

of‘ hand. I suggest that he run

and catch it.
' In either case, the resultis
stupid. :: .. '

I cannot see how ‘anybody with

any intelligence would bother to-

concern himself with such ab-
surdities.'Whyp not devote, one’s‘

' energies ,to. more valuable pur-

- suits like 'cleani.ng_library win-

pdows. This will shed all -[kinds of .
_ light on higher, education.»

A closer‘ look at .;this gob of
prose reveals something quite
interesting. If “assistance” is,_’,in-
terpreted as meaning direct aid
to, or from, others, there is
nothing in the oath that gives
Core members any causepto ree-

frain from'cheating' individually. .
They can remainzupright Cores.

Core Critic Argues
Honesty Is Personal
Editor, ’I"he’Pitt News: '

I remember, when I was a
counselor at a” summer camp, one
of my duties wasto check each
evening to be certain that the

‘campers had taken care of their

personal cleanliness. I consider-

ed this a reasonable task; be-
cause I realized that at camp
‘there are many other things
which clutter a‘young mind. The
last of their thoughts is personal
habits. ‘

On the other hand, a college
student is not a young child and
is not a person whose mind is
so cluttered with extraneous
thoughts that he forgets personal
habits. In fact, these habits» seem
to be a most important factor in
their lives. One of these personal
habits, andl emphasize personal,
iis honesty. , .

, If an individual wants to be

dishonest, it’s his own business,
his personal business. Ilfeel cer-
tain that one day this dishonesty
will catch up with him; but I
donft ‘believe it takes a core of
oath-spouting students ‘to hasten
the process. , ‘
And what of these people who
are taking the oath‘ not to be dis-
honest and to turn”in».any stu-
dent’ they see being so. I have
always. felt that a person de-
grades‘ his‘ ownpfine qualities by
talking of them. A'good—hearted
_person lowers my admiration of

. him the moment he _tells me of the

good things he’s'_done. In the same
respect, an honest « person i‘ makes

me wonder about his honesty when

he begins taking oathscabout it.

I I can picture ‘mid-terms: all is .

quiet," all are working at their
exams.‘ Suddenly, the door bursts

Pitt News Editorial
‘garried Too Far’

ulllv IVV ICII

' Editor, The Pitt News:

We/ would like to voice our
opinion on the subject of the
World Series, alsubject apcertain
editorial writer so unreasonably
dealt with in an editorial entitl- "
ed “Ringside Seats.”

Granted, it may be unfortunate
that our university is located di-

‘ rectly adjacent to Forbes Field.‘

But it seems completely absurd
to say thatvthe vibrating cheers
will disturb delicate lab experi-
ments. This is carrying things a
bit too far. A

It may also be true that hund-
reds of out_of town visitors will
invade our campus, but it is
doubtful that they will desire
sightseeing tours through our
beautiful Cathedral. ‘They have
/come to our city to see one thing,
our Pittsburgh Pirates. , V

The Pirates have been faith-
fully followed for 33 years by
loyal fans, many of whom no
doubt are Pitt Alumni. It seems
quite out of place for one nar-
row minded individual to so sev-
erly criticize our national pas-
time and in doing so criticize
our expressed congratulations to
the Pirates on behalf of our uni-
versity. This .should be enough-
evidence that our Pitt News edi-
torials should at‘.least support
our National League Champions.

iUniVersal Disarmame

‘Passing the Buck’:

For ‘Unsuccessful.

Plans Harmful A

By SHEILA MALLINGER

Universal disarmament, ac-
cording to Norman Thomas,
Thomas, note Socialist leader,
is the only means by which

~.—’ we can eliminate the fear cre-

ated by nuclear weapons.

Although the fear of war did
exist in previous years, said
Thomas, its psychological effect
was not nearly as great as in our
time, for never before has man
had the ability to completely an-
nihilate the human race.

‘-‘Men don’t really hate war,"
Thomas said. Actually, they cher-
ish the power, honor, and prop_—
erty that they gain from it.

Limited VVa.r Absurd

Thomas believes that war is a
primitive means ofsettling differ-
ences, and the notion that we can
carry on a limited war while we

it are in possession of nuclear wea-

pons, is absurd.

“We ought to renounce the
weapons we can’t trust ourselves
to use,” Thomas said, “because
someone‘ is going to want to
win badly enough to use them.”

“The United States government
has never sincerely demanded
disarmament strongly enough to
use police power to enforce it.”

Leaders Want Life
“It is true,” he continued, “that

the Russians are difficult,‘ and

that we are wary of trusting them,

,.,--but it is also true that Khrush-

chev wants to live and he wants
his people to live.”

Thomas feels that we’re harm-
ing ourselves when we place
blame for the failure of disarm-
ament on others, for we don’t
act like people who want dis-
armament. The pentagon has
said that no plan for total dis-
armament is workable.

Thomas disagreed that a strong »

Students from the freshmen

Fresh Gridders
Tangle With WVU

By MARSHALL ROMEO

The fresh gridders travel to
Moundsville, W. Va. tomor-
row night to meet the West
Virginia fresh.

Both teams have played
one game and each came out

with a victory. The Panther Cubs
whipped Indiana State 27-0 while

S the Little Mountaineers squeaked
pout a.21-20 victory over Penn

State.

Cat Coach Lou “Bimbo” Cec-
coni is satisfied with the way his
boys have shaped up. There was
never any doubt how good. the
backﬁeld was but the line has
been the big question mark.,They
showed tremendous improvement
in the [game with Indiana and in
scrimmage against the varsity. I

Cecconi’s lineup will not un-—
dergo any‘ drastic changes but
there may be a few shifts in the
line in order to strengthen the
middle, The game with In_di-
ana showed Cecconi that there
were several halfbacks. that
could. be used as substitutes

 without weakening the team.

West Virginia has only 19 boys
on scholarships this year compar-
ed with 53 brought in ‘last ."€"dI‘-

‘\make 'up in quality. They have

five Panther tackles. However,
leading the Cats on defense lately
has been Paul Hodge and Jim
Cunningharir/1”.
Hodge Leads Cats

‘ Hodge, a senior linebacker, was
credited with 13 tackles last week.
“Hodge has been doing a ﬁne job
on defense,” Coach John Miche-
losen said. “He along with Cun-
ningham have been keeping our
defensive team strong.”

The C-Boys again look like
the runners that helped the Pan-
thers finish the season last year
with three straight wins. Bob
Clemens picked up 83-yards in

i 12 carries last Saturday. .
However, the C—Boys would
still be luke-warm if it hadn't
been for Jim Traﬁeant, a sopho-
more from Youngstown Ohio.
Traﬁcant completed eight of 15
passes for 102 yards last week.
His passes did more than reach
their targets, they prevented the,
defense from concentrating their}
attack at the center of the line,;

The Blue and Gold booters

travel to Michigan this Satur-
day to meet a power packed
Spartan soccer squad. The
Cats have no idea of what to_

expect since the tentative

sophomores and only two letter-

The big gun of the Spartan team
is all—American center forward
Cecil Heron. Heron set the MSU
individual scoring record last year
with 18 goals in nine games.

Fullback Gerhard Grentz, the
only other letterman on the start-
ing team, will have to ﬁght it out
with two top sophomores. Jerry
Papachristou and John Gelminsi,
for the starting spot.

Michigan Stronger

“Our ball club s h o u l d be

which won seven and lost two,”
said Coach Gene Kenney. “They

EDITOR'S CORNER

Alan Gillespie

AT THE MOMENT OF FIRST EXPOSURE to his
audience the publisher of every new publication
feels a strong compulsion to stand forth and
make a few self-introductory remarks, and I am
no exception. Here is an occasion when I feel it
is important for me not to resist the temptation.
For Paperback Review is, in a way, a revolu-
tionary document—a kind of “Common Sense,”
we hope, for the new age of the book industry.

THE PURPOSE OF PAPERBACK REVIEW is not to
celebrate the Paperback Revolution. That is
hardly necessary. But we here make it our busi-
ness to provide a headquarters for the conven-
ience of the men and women, students and book
lovers who won that Revolution in the ﬁrst place.
Certainly we do not regard paperbacks as the
Cinderellas of the book business. We look upon
them as the..most vigorous and signiﬁcant part
of the book trade, that partof it in which partici-
pate the Americans who do the most reading and
who get the most out of what they read. With
this issue of Paperback Review, then, we inaugu-
rate a survey-and-review medium which will
treat paperbacks with all proper seriousness and
completeness. Paperback Review is not a simple

, catalogue of the 12,000-plus paperbacks which

have been published since 1939. -What we have
done is to gather together a staff of 17 re-
nowned American scholars and specialists, ask-

‘ ing them to cull out of the legions in print the 500

titles which strike them as having the most to say

I in 21 different major ﬁelds;comments on these

selected titles have been added by members of
Paperback Review’s staff. The advantage to
everyone is obvious: we provide the reader, and
the manager of the local bookstore, with a prac-
tical guide to the titles, that at least one platoon

  Paperback 
   Wonderland

, The small book has
hada big

eﬂect on education

_ by MARK VAN DOREN

A BOOKSTORE IN "mass DAYS of paperbacks has become
a, wonderland. For anybody who may stroll in, it is a
paradise of titles, banked in such profusion that one some-
times despairs of ever getting to the end of them. Indeed,
that would be diﬂicult to do, and on second thought it
is good that this is so; for to move among them is to get

4 a kind of education on the way, as if the bookstore were

a library whose stacks were full of surprises. Not the least

”°i7‘irtue of a library is the trick it has of letting you know

’ .

about books of whose very existence you never dreamed. .

You go in for one book, but you ﬁnd dozens of others
which in time you hope to read. You find, furthermore,
whole types and systems of books of which you hitherto
have been unaware; you uncover subjects, you stumble
into sciences, you break through walls beyond which
there are worlds of words you never supposed would be
put together so. It is a bewildering experience, and it does
the mind good to have it.

; —ToDAx' THE TYPICAL STUDENT keeps rows of paper-

backs before him on his desk or on the shelves above his .

bed, and they are the very stuff of his intellectual exist-
ence. Some of them he has been required to buy for
courses; yet if he is typical, most of them are discoveries
and possessions of his own. They may be biographies;
literary studies; reference works. They may indeed be
anything. And therein liesthe revolution. The literature
of the world is at his hand—or, ideally, it might if he had
money enough and if the publishers kept on bringing out

- new titles forever. And these books are literally of every

/

_;kind. The American student, that is to say, has now
capght up with the student of Europe and South America,
who long ago could take it for granted that new books
would be paperbound—-new reprints, too, and editions
of old works that a purchaser was free to bind as he
pleased as soon as he was sure he wanted to keep them.

Nor THAT THE SITUATION is entirely new in the United
States and England. In a sense it existed during the 19th
century, when for example there was Bohn’s Library (or
libraries, for the thing had branches), which reprinted

hundreds of books in a uniform binding at a moderate‘
price. The binding was cloth, but a student in those days
was lucky to have many books of great worth put within
his reach. And there were other such series, some of them
indeed with paper backs. My own memory goes back to
the early years of this century, when the student’s best
friend was Everyman’s Library. It still is his. good friend,
but it has taken on competitors, and theyihave taken off
the cloth. I was in college between 1910 and 1914, when
a volume of Everyman cost 35 cents. And there were
hundreds of Everyman’s—-eventually, I believe, well over
a thousand-whose titles I’ poured over on the jackets
and ﬂyleaves without believing I could ever own them all.
But I did end up by owning a good many. More, of course,
than I could afford, as is the way with students. And some
of these I never read; I simply looked at them and planned
to read them, and showed them proudly to my friends.
Most of them, however, I did read and have with me
still. In a very real sense they were my education, which

I gave myself. A student is most a student when he buys’

books—cheap ones, they must be—-and hoards them as if
they were a secret wealth, come at by devices quite his
own. So with my Everyman’s, whose gilt backs were a
constant delight to my eye, just as their contents were
something Icould almost think I had conceived myself.

A little later there were the World’s Classics, and still
later, when I was no longer a student, the Modern Library.
Then came Pocket'Books, in paper. I suppose the revolu-
tion started there—-unless it started afterward with the
Penguin Books in England and the Anchor Books in the
United States, for out of their example ﬂowedthe tide
of titles I began by describing. And still it ﬂows, happily
with no end in sight. Once more the literature of the
world, but on a scale not imagined before, lies at the’
student’s hand.

And naturally, ‘no less at the teacher’s. The college
bookstore is his playground, whether he goes there merely

V as a reader or_ as one who plans a course his students will

follow. But he is ﬁrst of all a reader. I see- him, eager
at the racks, ﬁngering and‘ leaﬁng books whose titles
astonish him, for he had not heard that they were out

in paper covers. I-Ie exclaims to himself, or to a_ colleague
standing by, and charges more merchandise at the desk
than he can afford. And sometimes a course is born at
such a moment: a series of texts outlines itself for him
so clearly that he ﬁnds it hard to wait until students will
be reading with him in a newly surveyed ﬁeld.

, PAPERBACKS HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED TEACHING, as well

as reading. And not merely because they are cheap. The
main reason is that they are plentiful. Of course there
is a connection: they are plentiful because there are more
of us who can buy them. But it might have followed from
this that titles would proliferate as they have done. That
they did proliferate is a tribute to the sagacity of the
publishers who had faith in the market for good books.
It is an unlimited market, the record seems to show.
Books that sell by the thousands in cloth sell by the tens
of thousands in paper, a ratio which more than reﬂects
the difference in price. It is as if we preferred paper
covers for their own sake. And in a sense we do, partic-

ularly now that they are being sofreshly and invitingly»

designed. Their purchaser has turned into a collector of
them, somewhat as I was once a collector of Everyman’s
Library. Yet.the basic fact is the plenitude of titles. Also,

there is the teacher’s assurance that he can assign whole '

books which the student can own and mark up for him-
self. There is a great difference between the two experi-
ences. And all the more so when the books the student

' owns can stand before him on his desk as a meaningful

series, in the humanities or otherwise.

The price, of ‘course, is not always low. It begins at
35 cents where Everyman once was, but it climbs from
there to as much as several dollars for big works for
which there will not be an immense demand. Even then,
however, the cost is relatively low; and the decisive fact
is that the big work-for instance, Sandburg’s Lincoln-
gets printed at a price and in a size which any student will
ﬁnd feasible. The ultimate consideration is the wealth
of output. There was nothing like it till our time. We are
lucky to live when we do, at least so far as good books
are concerned. .

The World in
Paper Covers

by BERNARD SHIR.-CLIFF

ONE AFTERNOON IN APRIL, 1953, a reporter from the Saturday Review went up to the
Doubleday ofﬁces in New York. He wanted to ﬁnd out about a new series of paperbacks
called Anchor Books. The man he spoke to was J ason. Epstein, “a young man in a white
button-down shirt and gray ﬂannels,” who, at 24, must have seemed very young
indeed to be in charge of so large an undertaking. Eighty thousand copies of the ﬁrst
four titles had just gone on sale in the bookstores, and another eight titles were
announced: An Essay on Man by Ernest Cassirer, Studies in Classic American Liter-

ature by D. H. Lawrence——the titles were of a breath-taking austerity, and the idea, if it’,

worked, would open up to the paperback market a whole new range of books formerly

available only in expensive editions or from libraries. Epstein did not seem worried '

tr

about their sale. The success of Mentor and Penguin books in 50-cent editions indicated
that a market existed for even more erudite selections. I

“Anchor seemed like the obvious thing to do,” Epstein said-“to provide really good
books at prices the majority could afford. . . . It’s an act of faith in the existence of that
market that we went ahead and did this.” He paused for a second, then added, “I guess
that sounds kind of romantic.” .

The sales were even more romantic: three of the ﬁrst four titles sold out within
weeks, print orders were soon stepped up to 37,500, and the Second Paperbound
Revolution was under way. By the end of 1954 there were seven publishers in the ﬁeld
(including such serious competitors as Alfred Knopf’s Vintage Books, the paperback
version of The Modern Library, Beacon Books, and Evergreen). ’

«L

TODAY THERE ARE ABOUT 45 active publishers in the high-priced paperback market.
Roughly they can be divided into two classes, according to initial printings,” price, and

format. Those who publish in the “pocket” format (Anchor, Vintage, Harvest, etc.) "

generally run a lirst printing of 10,000 to 20,000 copies, priced at 95 cents to about
$1.65. The “big” format books—-printed from the plates of the original hardicover
edition—come out in editions of 3000 to 10,000 copies, and are usually priced at $1.45
to $2.95 (though some cost $7.50 or more). /

IA rundown of some of the best-selling titles of 1959 gives a startling picture of the
popularity of supposedly “diﬂicult” books. Leader for the year was The Organization

lishers of high-priced paperbacks will provide about 800 additional titles for you to
consider this year, and will sell, including backlist, over 10 million books. I i

To shift from the high-priced paperback to the mass—market editions, youhave to
make several sharp adjustments in your thinking. Here the paperback revolution has
been going on since 1939, there are only about a dozen publishers, and the outlook for
1960 is not 10 million copies sold, but 300 million. Prices are low—concentrated at 35
and 50 cents. First printings start at 100,000 copies, and the big books of the year will
sell a million copies and up.

THE FIRST OF THE MODERN paperbacks appeared in June, 01939, when Robert De
Graﬂ launched Pocket Books——a name that has become almost the generic word for
paperback books. It is hard to imagine that the giant industry of today started from
such slender beginnings. With an investment of $30,000 De Grad and Simon and
Schuster produced the ﬁrst ten titles. Printings were only 10,000 copies, but the handy
size, the 25-cent price, and-—above all——the selection of titles won immediate success.
Within a month Pocket Books were on sale nationally, and four of the original titles-
Lost Horizon, Five Great_Tragedies of Shakespeare, Topper, and Wuthering Heights-
eventually sold more than a million copies each. By the end of the first year, Pocket
Books was solidlyestablished, with 34 titles in print and 1,508,000 copies sold.

The race was on. In August, 1939, Ian Ballantine introduced Penguin Books from
England. Avon began publishing in 1941, Dell and Popular Library entered in 1943.
Bantam Books came along in 1945. By the end of 1946, paperback books were selling
at the rate of 65 million a year. In 1948, Kurt Enoch and Victor Weybright bought out
Penguin and started the New American Library. In the same year came Permabooks,
Doubleday’s ﬁrst venture in the paperback market. Pyramid started in 1949, and Gold
Meda1—the ﬁrst house to publish all original titles—in 1950. In 1952, Ballantine Books
began issuing new titles simultaneously in trade and paperback editions. By 1958,
Ace, Berkley, Hillman, and Monarch rounded out the list of newsstand lines.

There is probably more excitement in the publishing of mass-market paperbacks
than anywhere else in the book trade.- With 1200 titles coming out every year, competi—
tion is ﬁerce. Publishers ﬁght for space on the racks and for the lead titles that will
bring importance and extra sales to their lists. In recent years,» guarantees in the
neighborhood of $100,000 have been reported for reprint rights to such titles as
Possessed; and Dell is

Have you
noticed the
latest style

in heroes?

by TERRY SOUTHERN

l

  Into the

ONCE EVERY GENERATION a character steps out of a page

of ﬁction who is so original and so real that he shakes
the semantics of an entire culture. Not merely his name
becomes a part of the language, but his attitude-—or, more
precisely, his perspective-—adds a’ new and permanent
facet to our awareness. lt is as though, during the night,
another eye had developed. V

This ﬁctional character is, in fact, the unexpressed
cultural image of the particular epoch in which he ap-
pears, like a composite microcosm, as if the whole society
were bunched at the wrong end of a telescopic mirror
and reduced to a single startling image. Startling, for an
image of what has not yet been expressed is necessarily at
ﬁrst unrecognizable—otherwise it would already exist.

Readers who have not yet picked up on the most recent
popular hero of British ﬁction are in for a treat. Here at
last is a breed of three-dimensional protagonists: original,
convincing, and sympathetic. The senior representative of
this new school of heroes is James ‘Dixon, of Lucky Jim,
a young university instructor in medieval history. There
is a Tom Ewell quality about Dixon, a sort of inherent

good faith and pleasant reticence. He is not consciously -

a rebel, and in fact he would like, above all, to be able
to take things seriously. But there is always something
in him, and in the situation, which makes this impossible.
In these situations, Dixon, because of his basic humil-
ity, isalways ambivalent as to who is at fault, he himself
or society. But it does not, of course, take the reader
many pages to decide. This is not to say, however, that
this literature is primarily concerned with “social criti-
cism,” as is often supposed. The most striking single
quality which is common to all of these heroes—Dixon,
‘Jimmy Porter, Sebastian Dangerﬁeld, Charles Lumley,
Billy Liar, . Larry Vincent, etc.*—is precisely the one
which also is present in the existentialist hero: an acute

, sense of the absurd. And if there arises out of this qual-

ity (as there almost inevitably will) a sharp irreverence
for the powers that be, the status quo, the establishment,

 

'’*'In order of appearance, and available in the following edi-
tions: Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis (Compass), Look Back
in Anger by John Osborn (Bantam), The Ginger Man by
J. P. Donleavy (Berkley), Hurry on Down by John Wain
(Knopf), Billy Liar by Keith Waterhouse (Norton), Happy
as Larry by Thomas Hinde (Criterion). Other “standards”
of this genre include The Sandcastle by Iris Murdoch (Vi -

'king), and Room at the Top by John Braine (Criterion).

The “new hero,’ as playednby Laurence

or Society, it is incidental. This remains true even if
its “social criticism” ﬁnally appears, in the popular view,
to be the most salient feature of the work. That is to say,
from the creative standpoint this aspect is still merely an
effect, not a cause. What seems to have happened here
is that the “heightened sensitivity” which was always a
traditional characteristic of young heroes in English
ﬁction now equates, as in existentialist literature, to “an
acute sense of the absurd”—the one is inconceivable with-
out the other, or, in fact, the two are synonymous.

ON THE AMERICAN scENE the companion image to
Lucky Jim Dixon has not yet come into being. Excluding
the exiled hero of Henry Miller’s two Tropic books,
which even were theyrnot banned would now be out of
date, the nearest creation there has been in this combina-
tion of candor and sensitivity is Holden Caulﬁeld, the
young hero of Catcher in the Rye. This is a considerably
lesser achievement, however, because Holden Caulﬁeld
is not an adult but a child-and candor leading to irrever-
ence in a child, however advanced, is bound to be fairly
innocuous.

It is no great trick for an author to create an “original
character”——he has only to lend “a curious gray cast to
her single lidless eye.” The real feat, of course, is to
create a character who is original and yet not psycho-
logically freakish; and the greatest coup du métier of all
is to make that character the one person in the story‘with
whom we most deeply identify. This is exceedingly rare,
though less so, of course, in life than in literature-because
in life one does occasionally meet strange and unprece-
dented people (often the very sort that novels warn
against)and, after a few emancipating experiences, ﬁnds
them to be quite worth while after all. Unhappily, the
characters and events in a book are almost invariably
drawn from the author‘s literary experience, rather than
from life or from imagination. Consequently, what he
undertakes in his work, and almost without realizing it,
is merely to imitate——to imitate the imitations of previous
imitations——until at last he does become a famous pro-

fessional and, in accordance with his drive and ability,‘

at ﬁrst—, second-, or third-rate hack.

0 N THE OTHER HAND, a writer of serious pretensions or,
more accurately, one who writes out of some deep per-
sonal impulse, consistently strives to create original char-

acters in the manner of, say, Faulkner, and is frequently
successful. The rub is that these characters most often

have only a highly specialized appeal and generally a

negative quality. It is the difference,» for example, between
Popeye of Sanctuary, an original, and Arthur Winner of
By Love Possessed, a copy. Therefore, the birth in print
of a really new and yet widely sympathetic ﬁgure is a rare
and felicitous occasion indeed, even though, as in most
births, the conception may have been strictly accidental.

' ONE SAYS THAT A THING IS ORIGINAL, but of course i

nothing, ever is. The grandfather of all these young Eng-
lish heroes is Waugh’s Guy Crouchback. This is signiﬁ-
cant, because whereas Crouchback was a blasé aristocrat,
the new hero is——I believe without exceptionwfrom the
lower middle class. Crouchback was an incorrigibly ir-
reverent young man in the British colonial service in
Africa, so sophisticated that on one occasion»(Black
Mischief), having gotten himself lost in the jungle, he
came upon some natives (“frightfully dirty they were,”

he recalled later in the comfort of his London club,~

“rather ﬁerce, too”), had a meal with them, only to learn
afterward that the main ingredient of the cannibal stew
had been his ﬁancée. (“It was all too horrid, of course-

tasted rather sweet, actually.”) Crouchback is hardly the ’

sort of person the man in the street could readily identify
with; he is too blasé, too insensitive, too humorless, and
too rich. Not so with Dixon and the others—there is noth-
ing fanciful or unsulfering about them; ﬂrey are, on the
one hand, the dregs of society and, on the other, the
salt of the earth . . . evoking both pathos and admiration.
That they are blasphemous in a godless age is the crown-
ing wonder. As acultural image, their enduring appeal
is that which comes with the sigh of relief when, having
at last actually caught a glimpse of one’s full-face reﬂec-
tion in the glass, one ﬁnds that, while it can hardly be
called ideal, it is still, all things considered, not nearly
so bad as one might have expected—and, in fact, might
even be said to have one or two passable features.

From the literary (or entertainment) standpoint -it is
certainly worth a peek, meanwhile wondering just what
manner of man the new Leatherstocking will be, or the
new Jake Barnes. The prospect is an exciting one.

Terry Southern, a native of Texas, is the author of two
novels: The Magic Christian (Random House) and Flash and
Filigree (Coward-McCann_).,

. Awake! for Morning in the Bowl of Night

Has ﬂung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight:
And Lo! the Hunter of the East has caught
The Sultan’s Turret in a Noose of Light.

. We were in study hall when the headmaster walked in,

followed by a new boy not wearing a school uniform, and
by a janitor carrying a large desk. Those who were sleeping
awake, and we all stood up as though interrupting our
work.

. In that pleasant district of merry England which is watered

by the river Don, there extended in ancient times a large
forest, covering the greater part of the beautiful hills and
valleys which lie between Sheﬂield and the pleasant town
of Doncaster.

A throng of bearded men, in sad-colored garments and
gray, steeple-crowned hats, intermixed with women, some
wearing hoods, and others bareheaded,’ was assembled in
front of a wooden ediﬁce, the door of which was heavily
timbered with oak, and studded with irdn spikes.

. I was ever of opinion, that the honest man who married and

brought up allarge family, did more service than he who
continued single, and only talked of population. From this
motive, I had scarce taken orders a year before I began to
think seriously of matrimony, chose my wife as she did
her wedding gown, not for a fine glossy surface, but such
qualities as would wear well. '2

. When 1 was a _small boy at the beginning of the century I

remember an old man who wore knee breeches and worsted
stockings, and who used to hobb-le about the street of our
village with the help of a stick. He must have been getting
on for eighty in the year 1807, earlier than whichdate-I

suppose I can hardly remember him, for I was born in .

1802.

. I celebrate myself,

And what I assume you shall assume,
For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.

While the present century was in its teens, and on one sun-
shiny morning in June, there drove up to the great iron gate
of Miss Pinkerton’s academy for._young ladies, on Chis-
wick Mall, a large family coach, with two fat horses in
blazing harness, driven by a fat coachman in a three-

. cornered hat and wig, at the rate of four miles an hour..

In the castle of Baron Thunder-ten-tronckh in Westphalia,
there once lived a youth endowed by nature with the
gentlest of characters. His soul was revealed in his face.
He combined rather sound judgment with great simplicity
of mind . . .

in 1619 to the incidents at Clinton and Little Rock, this

SEX HISTORIES OF AMERICAN COLLEGE MEN
by Drs. Pb y//is and Eberhard Kronbausen 75¢

“Silence and embarrassment surround the very discussion
of man’s sexual nature. Thus, numerous young men and
women reach the age of nubility with incomplete, inac-
curate and anxiety-ridden notions regarding behavior
which is to play an important role all through their adult
existence. The two authors, both trained in psychology
. . . have dealt with their subject boldly and directly, and
their naturalistic and optimistic orientation may have a
therapeutic effect on those readers (parents, teachers
and young people themselves) who are in need of this
type of enlightenment.” — Library Journal.

THE CAUSES OF WORLD WAR III
by C. Wright Mills 50¢

The author of White Collar and The Power Elite has

“He is eloquent, fervid, at times diﬂicult, never wasteful
of words, and completely out of patience with this idiot’s
race between the- United States and the U.S.S.R. which
could conceivably wind up with the reviewer, the reader
and the reviewed — all completely right and all com-
pletely dead.” - R. L. DUFFUS, The New York Times.

STRIDE TOWARD FREEDOM
by Martin Luther King, Jr. 50¢

“Martin Luther King is a~product of Southern civilization
and some day the whole South will take pride in his
achievement. In STRIDE TOWARD FREEDOM Dr. King tells
how he and his colleagues were able to set the pattern of
victory through non-resistance‘ regardless of any provo-
cation. Some day all of America will look back upon this
phenomenon as one of the greatest stories of our heri-
tage.” —- HARRY GOLDEN.

said to have paid a whopping $235,000 for the right to publish
Return to Peyton Place as a paperback original. With big guar-
antees go big print orders. A real blockbuster of a book will start
oﬁ with a printing of a million copies. If the publisher has guessed
right, he has a winner that may run up a two- or three-million-copy
sale in one year. If he is wrong, he pays his guarantee, swallows
an enormous return of unsold books, and tries to ﬁgure out what
happened. ‘ ,. . 1

Books are not like magazines. They do not go out of date, and
their sales vary widely by title, by region, even by district in the
same town. Alert wholesalers have reﬁned their techniques by
sending out bookmobiles and training men who specialize in the
distribution of books. Even so, there are problems. The average
retail outlet has room ‘ for only a fraction of the active titles.
With 100 new titles appearing every month, older books must
give way. »

F ACED wxrn HARD PROTBLEMS, the publishers are coming up with
some ingenious solutions. They publish a “series”—-such as war
books—-in which new titles reinforce the demand for the old. They
work with distributors and booksellers to set up “full-line” shops
where a purchaser can ﬁnd as many as 5000 diﬁerent titles always
in stock. They reach for the top of the ﬁction audience with novels
like The Ginger Man, A Death in the Family, and Decline and‘
Fall. They compete with the high-priced paperbacks for the col-
lege market with lines like De1l’s Laurel Books, New American’s
Mentor series. They sell to the high schools through the Teen
Age Book Club (which distributed 10 million books through the
schools last year), and by bringing out their own series of classics
speciﬁcally designed to meet the need for low—cost books for
required and supplementary reading in school. They are deter-

mined to win and hold an ever ‘greater share of the book trade 5

not only in America but throughout the world. But they could
fail-for a great wave of paperback publishing swept the country
back in the 70’s and 80’s but vanished completely by 1900.

Will history repeat itself? Publishers concede that it may—if
production costs run too high, if television or some new medium
draws people away from reading, if our civilization itself fails to
provide the coming generations with the skills and incentives to
read. But they don’t believe that any of these things will happen.
The taste for book reading is growing, the population is rising,
and the forecasters predict that by 1965 paperbound books will
be bought and read atthe rate of more than 900,000,000 a year.
William L. Shirer, journalist, author, and member of the council
of the Authors’ League of America, has given this assessment:
“The whole economic future in writing and publishingprobably
lies in these paperbacks.” ‘ \
