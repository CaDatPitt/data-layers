IA/Wpo«ssible' solution to the recent problem “of what speakers

Monday’s Town Meeting.

’ should appear before University audiences” presented itselfat

This solution involves the use of student-faculty round-
table discussions; for if all campus roundtables could be as ex-
citingly thought-provokin.g as last Monday’s, many of the vis-
iting speakers could remain uninvited without severe loss to
University intellectual standards.

It may be the roundtable of last Monday was exceptional in
the amount of interest and spirit displayed by participating fac-
ulty members and students; it may be that the subject, “What
is America’s part in a world at war?” is of such vital import
that any discussion on it would be a whiz-bang success; at any
rate the reports that were touched off by that roundtable will
be re-echoed in faculty cubbyholes, in the classroom, in the
smoking rooms, in the Faculty club, in bull session, or in seminar.

As we are writing this edit with the vision of verbal bloody
noses and mouses fresh in our delighted retrospect, we may not
be doing justice to off-campus speakers when we suggest that
less of them and more of the faculty can do the trick, but the
sight of staid professorial dignity being lain aside in favor of
partisanship and emphatic opinions " convinces us that these
roundtables would continue to serve up tasty tidbits of diversi-
ﬁed knowledge and would begin to cement student-faculty rela-
tions on a more personal and human basis.

To stop raving and get to the point:

Last Monday’s session

“High Tor” opens tonight on
the Foster memorial stage as
Pitt Players present Maxwell
Anderson’s Critics circle award
play to the public.

Curtain for both performances rises
at 8:15 o’clock.

The cast, directed by Buell White-
hill, assistant professor of English,
is headed by James Dunn, C43, as
Van Dorn, the role created by Bur-
gess Meredith in the prize-winning

Broadway production. Hulda ‘Tul-
ly, C41, and Louise Rowland, Ed42,
have the feminine leads of Lise and
Judith, Van’s ghostly and earthly
love, respectively.

Major roles will also be taken by
Dan Cannon, C41, as Skimmerhorn;
Paul Demerit, C44, as Biges; Bob
Ryan E41, as DeWitt; and Jules
Cubernek, Ed41, as Captain Asher.

Others appearing in the cast are:
Sam Rodgers, C41; Jerry Lieber,
BA41; Alex Endy, C44; Dave
Barkan, C44; Allen Gould. C43;
Aldo Icardi, C43; Bob Glenn, C44;
D. L. Moses, Ed44; Chester Band-
man, BA43; Bob Soles, BA43; and
Joe Portnoy, C44.

All the action in the drama takes
place on and around High Tor, a
magniﬁcent headland facing the
Hudson river. The three-act com-
edy is concerned with the actions
of a double-dealing ﬁrm of real
estate men who try to steal the

‘ mountain from its owner.

The play has been described by
critics as a “whimsical, delightful
play, a rare study of character de-
velopment as affected by the eco-

 -nomic demands--of - present-day con-“-

ditions.” It is written in the same
blank verse form as Maxwell An-
derson’s successful stage and screen
production, “Winterset.”

announces Richard Harman, C41,
student chairman of the affair.

Designed to honor 200 University
fettermen and the freshman football
squad, the assembly will take place
in the Commons Room Friday eve-
ning and will feature prominent
sports ﬁgures, both on and off
campus.

0. H. (Fritz) Crisler, head coach

lhiufenhach Says Pitt Dances
Haven ’t Changed Very Much

By Charles Camarata

“Black Bottom or Doggie, stu-
dents like to dance as much today as
they did 15 years ago," says Wil-
liam" Daufenbacn, ‘assistant to ‘the
dean of men, who hasimissed only
one University dance in 15 years.

Bill’s familiar ﬁgure has been

, seen at every school dance since

1925, and will doubtless be seen at
the next one. Therefore, it is ﬁtting
that a thumbnail history, taken
from Bill’s private records, be pre-
sented.

In the ﬁrst place, the enthusiasm
hasn’t changed; students would still
rather dance than study. The at-
tendance at school dances has re-
mair.o.~1 the same, but Bill remem-

Of Foreign Trade System, Complete Isolation Policy for U. S.

By Irwin Rosen

Professional dignity was cast
aside in a heated argument last
Monday at Pitt Town Meeting’s
panel discussion of “America in a
World at War.” Jibes about “bi—
ology professors who profess to
know something about economics”
hurtled through the air. No names
were named and no personalities
mentioned, but faces reddened as
the discussioneers howled about
unidentiﬁed colleagues with “ab-
solutely no grasp of world affairs.”

One faculty member, in attempt-
ing to clarify the issues of the dis-
cussion, labeled the whole proceed-
ings “superﬁcial, and answering
none of the vital problems of the
day foremost in all our minds.”

Advocating a policy of complete
isolation for the United States and

‘opposed by four other members of

the faculty on the panel and one
from the audience, Dr. Samuel H.

Williams, professor of biology, found
himself virtually alone in the “iso-
lation” opinion as he stormed, “Let’s
mind our own business and not
stick our neck out looking for trou-
ble.’i’

Most of the others on the panel
agreed entirely or in part with the
idea that “isolation without the
collapse of our entire foreign trade
system is impossible. Economic ties
depend upon political bonds.”

The other faculty members par-
ticipating in the discussion, all shar-
ing the “interventionist” sentiment
presented above by Dr. Alfred P.
James, professor of history, were:
Dr. Carl Stotz, assistant professor
of geography; Dr. Benjamin H. Wil-
liams, professor of political science;

Blossom L. Henry, assistant profes-
sor of modern languages, and, aid-
ing the majority from the audience,
Dr. Francis D. Tyson, professor of
economics.
The panel was presided over by
Roy H. Umble, instructor in speech.
LThe ﬁrst question presented to
the panel by Mr. Umble was “What
are some of the speciﬁc problems
facing America in a world at war?”
Each faculty member had a dif-
ferent opinion to volunteer in an-
swer to Mr. Umble’s query as this
high-spirited Town Meeting swung
into action with a reply by Dr. Stotz.
He said that “America must be pre-
pared to take the lead after this
war, and not be a second rate fol-
lower, but must be a powerful ﬁrst
rate nation.”
Dr. James offered the solution of

domestic problems as a step toward
the leadership suggested by Dr.
Stotz when he said “Let’s do some-
thingiabout our employment prob-
lem as the first step in national de-
fense.”

Then Dr. Stotz, joined by Miss
Henry and Dr. Ben Williams, pre-
sented the Orient as a possible
sphere for the development of our
“leadership,” pointing out new, un-
developed markets.

At this point Dr. Samuel Wil-
liams brought forth his isolation
argument, to which he clung veh-
emently throughout the discussion.

“Leadership!” he declared. “Let’s
talk about leadership after we’ve
solved our own problems. Let’s
first set up a strong economic sys-
tem within our own country. How

bers the time when they “didn’t
know where to put them” at one
dance in Hotel Schenley ’way back
in the Twenties.

Decorations today don’t compare
very favorable with the "ones, they
used to have. Dance committees in
the earlier history of the school
thought nothing of having a full-
grown fountain in the middle of
the ﬂoor. Real water and every-
thing! Once they had the floor
represent the ﬁrst deck of a ship,
and the only way one could get on
or off was by means of gangplanks.

The price per couple at the Jun-
ior proms used to be $10, which in-
cluded such items as a four-piece
dresser set as a favor. With boxes
stacked along the walls up to the
ceiling, couples used to dance to the
music of Red Nichols, Isham Jones,
Zez Confrey, Ferdie Groffe, and
Ollie Naylor. .

Dances are still held in the same
places—Hotels William Penn, Web-
ster Hall, Schenley—although a few
were held in Duquesne Gardens
and Motor Square Garden. The
majority used to be held in the
Hotel Webster Hall.

You wouldn’t think it, but de-
portment at dances today is some-
what better than in the years pre-
ceding the depression. There was
a time when Bill used the student
ﬁle from the dean of men’s office
to check the incoming couples at
the door to keep out shady—looking
strangers. He says that isn’t neces-
sary any more.

“Outside of the fact that dances
don’t have the grandeur they used
to have, they are as frequent, have
about the same number of students

“attending, and are looked forward

to as enthusiastically as in 1925,”
says Bill in summing up.

Guest Editorial:
On %Var Aims

Tender minded idealists should concentrate
on writing poetry, not editorials.

For, as poetry, your recent effort, War Aims:
What and Where, might have been entertain-
ing; but as an editorial it was disturbing.

The editorial takes a cursory glance at the
whole of western culture, including the United
States, and ﬁnds every part of this culture
equally vile and ugly and evil. The editorial
is the conclusion of a puritan who divides every-
thing into either good or bad———black or white.

White is the ideal society in which is found
neither racial prejudice, nor religious bigotry,
nor economic injustice. This society has never
existed anywhere except inside the heads of a
few poets. Yet by comparing existing societies
with this ideal picture, the puritan makes the
real world utterly black and valueless.

The choice is a fictitious one. Here and now
there exist a Nazi society and an American so-
ciety-—-no ideal ones.

This American society like all societies feeds
itself in part on social and political garbage—
repression of minorities, economic injustices.
There can be no objection to men who are fear-
less enough to lift the lids from our American
garbageacans. But I can and do object to the
implication that Americans dine on a steady
diet of offal.

In the United States we also have such things
as an independent labor movement, free intel-
lectual inquiry, and the toleration of divergent
opinions and groups. Even more important than
th;e‘“sTe"is““-’the promise of the democratic process
which allows" dissatisﬁed individuals to organize
political pressure groups without fear of a
Gestapo, provided only that these individuals
have enough guts and intelligence to organize.

In America moreover we know garbage when
we smell it. The Nazis have declared the high-
est end of man is to engage in the violent sub-
jugation of so-called inferior races. Garbage
has become, for them, a digestible delicacy; the
Aryan supermen possess superstomachs as well.

A In ‘the face of this racial nonsense we must
afﬁrm" that our society is worth saving, worth
ﬁg"ht‘ing"'”for; yes,-“if need be, Worth dying for.
Puritans who repudiate this society because
parts of it are evil, should learn that politics is
not like love. In politics you can compromise
with your principles and not lose a shred of
your virtue.—Sam Rodgers, C41.

Comnson
Sense

By Gerald Ziskind

I protest the sophomoric and ir-
responsible charge that we are in-
escapably headed for war. Even
self-appointed peace-mongers, who heretofore

 

the
blatantly proclaimed their deathless hatred of war, now
throw up their hands in disgust and cry, “What’s the

use! We’re already in!” I refer, of course, to our
provincial—minded isolationists, our pacifist appeasers,
and most ﬂagrant of all, the superﬁcial and cynical col-
legiate “liberals” in our midst.

Hiram Johnson of California, the isolationist sen-
ator, utters Cassandra-like larnentations, warning that
we are virtually in the war. Senators Bennett Clark
and Rush Holt, who fought every proposal for aid to
Britain, predict our immediate involvement in the con-
ﬁagration. And now collegiate pundits and editorial
writers join the dolorous chorus, bleating about the
helplessness and doom of our generation.

I say that these defeatists are the most insidious
and debilitating element in Americanlife. If we be-
come involved in war, their irresolution will be to
blame. These advocates of aloofness and inaction are
either so naive or superﬁcial that they cannot under-
stand this vital fact-——that by aiding Britain we reduce
the likelihood of having to sacriﬁce our youth in a
head-on collision with a victorious Germany.

Pox Vohiscum

Zealots for peace are so afraid of war that their
timidity invites disaster. Blind to the fate of neutral
European countries, they moan when America seeks to
avoid the pitfalls and suicidal errors of nations now
defunct. Britain and France, Holland and Belgium
alike feared to assert themselves because of threats of
war. We know the consequences. When the show-
down came, the appeasers were confronted with a foe
more ﬁerce and formidable. Proﬁting from this lesson,
America refuses to sit sinugly by and, in the name of
neutrality, await ultimate strangulation.

Our government knows that the Nazi regime is our
sworn enemy; that Hitler, if he wanted a pretext for
assault, could have found provocation long ago in our
expressions of pro-Allied sentiment. Yet the German
Reich is not at war with us———and will sedulously avoid
any overt declaration of war—so long as Hitler realizes
that the immense potentialities of America’s industrial
plant can be mobilized to deliver a knockout blow for
freedom. We can with safety and assurance bolster
the bulwarks of our democracy by aiding Britain to
weaken Hitler.

Why can’t we adhere to this program? Why can’t
democracy dynamically assert its will to survive? What
sacrosanct law foreordains that the shipment of arms
to Britain commits us to send troops as well?

Who, Us ?

Many so-called isolationists, I suspect, seek to stale-
mate aid to Britain, not because of sincere paciﬁst con-
"victions, but rather because of their dislike of British
“imperialism.” They want to see Eng1and’s social or-
der and civilization smashed so that India and Africa
can be “freed.” This amazing reasoning reminds one
of the man who burned down his house because the
kitchen ﬂoor was dirty. It is a pathetic and deranged
notion which only a crack—pot communist or hyper-
intellectualized college “liberal” could envision.

The great majority of Americans believe profoundly
in democracy, valuing this way of life too highly to
entrust it to blind Fate. They will not idly await the
outcome of German aggression. Rather, they believe
that by realistic appraisal of facts and forthright action,
we can aﬁect the shape of things to come. By our
decision to aid Britain with all our resources, we con-
found the prophets of gloom and capitulation at home,
and vigorously assert before all the world our positive
program for democracy, our indomitable determina-

tion to preserve the frontiers of freedom throughout
the world.

In Defense of Ourselves

The Kappa Kaper itemized in this

large, and inestimably enlightening
to ourselves. It proved one thing
Very deﬁnitely: we have many avid
readers, who, bless their hearts, be-
came our public.

At long last we found we had a

More Evidence

For Journeyman
Editor, the Pitt News:

Most of us like to talk, to read,
to communicate with other human
beings. A few of us insist upon
articulate expression in writing, a
serious expression of thinking, even
artistic thinking, perhaps.

The Journeyman was a deﬁnite
incentive for serious writing. But
its career was sporadic and short-
lived, a fact which testiﬁes to a
slovenly-minded student body. It
seems much blame has been placed
on the faculty. I think the real
blame lies with the students. There
were calls in the News for mate-
rial, a rather pitiful attempt to sup-
ply a fund of material that should
be forthcoming in volume from a
modern university. One feels a
little ashamed to admit that we
have no literary publication. A
literary publication can be bad if
the 600 people majoring in English
make it their responsibility to see
that that publication is supplied
adequately. I think such a publica-
tion is far more important than a
football team, than a News, than a
Panther; more important, probably,
than any single class.‘

The rehabilitated Journeyman
must not be a half-hearted attempt.
It must be as good as we can make
it. Its standards must be estab-
lished on the highest level and
maintained. It should not fall short
of American Prefaces; we can at-
tempt to rival American Prefacves.

The purpose of this letter is to
make every News reader aware, of
the need for a Journeyman. It is
hoped that all students of the Uni-
versity would show their interest
by buying, reacling, and criticising
the magazine. Contributions from
any student dealing with literary
material would, of course, be con-
sidered. I think it would be wise
to extend the scope of the magazine
to include the contributions of the
faculty.

_ I hope the Journeyman will again
come into existence; we all want it.
We want to see what we think,
nicely bordered on white pages. We
want to be able to hand the little
magazine to Harvard men and
say,‘ “This is our literary publica-
tion. ’ It’s good,” and know it”s good.

‘The Lone Rmtger’

Is Disarmed
Editor, the Pitt News:

“Bobby” Hamilton “views with
alarm” the recent restrictions im-
posed upon ﬁrearm owners in
America. Bobby believes that
everyared-blooded Pitt man should
have a gun in order to defend the
Cathedral.

From Indians? Nah. The Hoev-
eler boys? Nuh—uh. The Dents,
then? Nope, but you’re close. Bob
doesn’t say exactly but I gather
from all these subleties about Ger-
many and Italy that he wants civil-
ians to be armed against invasion.

Dear Bob, are you aware that the
government has just drafted sev-
enteen million men to be properly
trained with great big honest-to;
goodness guns in preparation for the
same invastion? Also, that quite a
number of people think this draft
is a hell of a waste of time and
money?

No kidding, Bob, I don’t think
you are too serious about civilian
gun ownership as a measure against
invasion; I think you’re just irked
because you probably had to reg-
ister that old twenty-two pistol you
used to “tote.” (Tote is cowboy talk
for carry.) You know, “the one that
saved your life when you used it
with intent to kill, the one that you
didn’t have the time you were al-

most killed by another man who
did.”

Bob, you said that when you car-
ry a gun you are free, free like a
mountaineer.‘ From what? The
vicious alley cats that stalk Forbes
street? Of course, you mean rob-
bers and malicious attackers. And
you would have the nervous little
bookkeeper , use a gun when the
street thief tries to steal his $18 pay
check. Defend himself, hell, he’d
be dead before he ever found the
pocket where he kept his gun. And
even if the little dope did kill the
robber, would he consider it worth
saving the $18, if he had to kill a
man to do it?

I have always felt that killing a
man was essentially wrong; fur-
ther, that most murders would not
happen if some angry crackpot
didn’t have handy access to a gun.
How many times have we heard
the hysterically dramatic lines “I
don’t know——all of a sudden the

gun was in my hand—-and“ then-‘*1 

heard a loud explosion——and—I
didn’t mean to kill anybody.” Of
course you didn’t. So you gave the
funny man with the red splotch on

‘his“"shirt a shot of your best bour-

bon and promised to send his son to
college. And now the darn kid
Wants to go fraternity! I
No, Bob, I don’t like guns. But I
like you. So I’m going to round up
some of the boys and we will all
chip in and buy you a pair of boots
and breeches for Christmas. May-
be if the kitty is big enough we
will get you a Buck Rodgers rocket
belt, too. _

Pitt Cagers Initiate

Seventeen-Game Card
With P37 is con sin Squad

Carlson-liloached Passers Swing
Through Midwest in Vacation

Into the strongholds of Western
Conference basketball next week
rides Pitt’s 1940 basketball squad,
and the Panthers must live up to
the prophecies of their most optim-
istic followers to beat down the
challenges of ﬁve tough Big Ten
squads, four of them perennial Con-
ference title-contenders.

Even the opening game with an
inexperienced Wisconsin ﬁve that
won only 5 out of 20 last year will

H. C. CARLSON
win some, anyway

be no set-up. The Badgers have
built a fast offense around Gene
Englund, 6 foot 4 inch ball hawk
who last year was top center in the
conference.

Illinois and Northwestern, re-
spectively, who tied for fourth in
last year’s Big Ten standings, catch
the “Busy Bee” Panthers next. The
Wildcats have a veteran quintet of
Captain, Al Butherus, Don Claw-
son, Don Kruger, George Benson,
and Henry Clason, though the loss
through ineligibility of Dick Klein,
second highest scorer in ‘the Big
Ten last year, is a break for Carl-

. .son’s boys.

Flashing their basketball .wares
against Butler University two days

' before Christmas, Pitt's ice—cream

eaters move out of the Big Ten cir-

. cle, and smack into one of the best

teams in the Midwest, victor in 17

out of 23 last year and 47-36 win-
ner over the 1939 edition of the
Golden Panthers.

Football all-time great, Bennie
Oosterbaan matches strategy with
basketball’s leading inventor when
Michigan’s Wolverines attempt to
repeat last season’s 44-35 triumph
over the Panthers. (You’ve guessed
it; Pitt lost quite a few ball games
last year.)

Up’n Down Wolverines

Like the Panthers, Michigan was
consistently inconsistent in the ’39-
’40 season. Victors in 9 of their
first 10 basketball battles, the Wol-
verines started downhill after they
passed the half-way mark and
haven’t been the same since. But
like the Panthers again, Ooster-
baan’s gang is experienced.

Ohio State’s Scarlet and Gray
horde is the ﬁnal adversary await-
ing the Panthers. Frequent Big
Ten top—notchers, Coach Harold
Olson’s boys play a tricky brand of
ball that often sends scores sky-
rocketing. From Columbus, if they
can still make it, the Panther bas-
keteers go home for celebration and
rest, until their ﬁrst home game
with Westminster on January 7.

The week of rest doesn’t register
as time wasted. Comes the new
year the Pitt courtmen wade into
Westminster and Penn State at the
Stadium, tackle Carnegie Tech at
the Skibo gym, and meet Waynes-
burg at home.

Trips to Duke, Army, Geneva,

Olson Expects

200 Candidates
At Trackhouse

Over 200 candidates are expected
to be in track uniforms before the
ﬁnal call is sent out, it was stated
by head coach Carl Olson late last
week, pointing out that all stu-
dents will have an equal opportu-
nity to make the squad.

Up until Wednesday of last week
only ﬁfty of this number had re-
ported to the trackhouse ready for
active practice. However, a large
number of new freshmen is expect-
ed to push the ﬁgure much higher.

In calling for the candidates,
Coach Olson stated that track work-
ed for both the individual and the
school beneﬁt, the latter by his ﬁne
teams, and the students by the fact
that the workouts will aid them
both physically and mentally.

Especially are freshmen invited
to try out for the track team Coach
Olson said. Although they will be
forbidden to compete in intercol-
legiate track meets, they will be
thoroughly trained in the funda-
mentals. Later, probably in the
early part of February, a novice
meet will be held at the trackhouse
at which time the ﬁrst year men
will have a chance to show their
ability.

‘This season, the squad shows
plenty of promise, although it is a
little too early yet to make any
predictions. Certainly, the Panth-
ers will miss the performance of
such ﬁne trackers as Al Ferrara,
Frank Ohl, Al McKee, Johnny
Bazyk and Bob Sulkowski. How-
ever, veterans Bill Carter, Happy
Stickel, Red Jessup, Larry Tregon-
ing, Del Anderson, and a ﬂock of
others may lessen the shock of
their graduation somewhat.

Thus far, the Panthers have been
engaging mainly in light prelimin-
ary workouts. The Blue and Gold
trackers are getting into condition
for their opening meet sometime
after the ﬁrst week of January.

“Students still desirous of trying
out for the indoor, track squad
should report to the Stadium equip-
ment room and draw out uniforms,”
the Panther mentor stated.

biggest gabfest of the 1940 season last Monday
morning. No, it wasn’t the 73-0 shellacking of the
Washington Redskins by the Chicago Bears. That
event was dwarfed into insigniﬁcance by the furor
created with the Sun-Te1egraph’s “ALL-America
team to end all All-America teams.”

Naturally, one of the chief reasons for the sen-
sation was the fact that Tom Harmon was omitted
from an all-America teainby the selector, for the
ﬁrst time this season. However, we think that
his omission was entirely justiﬁable.

The fact that Mr. Burris Jenkins works for the
Telegraph was quite evident‘, for his selections in-
clude only four characters from his rival comic
pages, seven choices coming from his own.

We support his backﬁeld. Superman would
undoubtedly ﬁll the fullback slot very capably.
Mandrake, at quarterback, would present the
trickiest oﬁense known to the game, while Popeye
and the Phantom make as ﬁne a pair of half-
backs as ever donned cleated shoes.

Where We are inclined to disagree is at the left

moved from right guard to X-9’s tackle post, and
Pat Ryan of “Terry and the Pirates” fame would
take the Lone Ranger’s terminal berth. We sim-
ply can’t‘ see the Lone'Ranger streaking for a pass
from Superman on Silver, unless a new rule is
entered into American football.

At the vacated guard spot, we’d place Captain
Easy, for who could we ﬁnd for a better charging
gridder to plague enemy backﬁelds and lead in-
terference. Our line would now look like this:
Pat Ryan, left end; Lothar, left tackle; Joe Palooka,
left guard; Tarzan, center; Easy, right guard;
Li’l Abner, right tackle, and Flash Gordon, right
end.

\Ve don’t know whom we could schedule with
this team. Certainly the Cicago Bears would be
no match, especially with George Connelly coach-
ing this outﬁt. Imagine the Bears getting any-
where against a 6-2-2-1 defense with Superman
and Tarzan backing up the line, the Phantom and
Mandrake at the defensive halfbacks posts for pass
defense, and Popeye as safety man.

Mayor to Lead Group

In Political Discussion

BusAd Students
Gather Tonight

Cornelius D. Scully, ’04, mayor
of the City of Pittsburgh, will
lead a symposium on “Problems
of Municipal Groveriiineiit” to-
night‘ at 8 o’clock before the
economics discussion group of
the School of Business Adminis-
tration. The meeting will be held
at Theta Chi fraternity, 249 Dith-
ridge street.

The meeting is open to all stu-
dents. Pat Gismondi, graduate stu-
dent in economics, will act as chair-
man.

The economics discussion group is
sponsored by Reuben J. Slesinger,
instructor in economics. It is sched-
uled to meet every three weeks off
campus, usually at Mr. Slesinger’s
home.

Speakers who have addressed the
group this year include: Dr. Elmer
D. Graper, professor and head of
the department of political science;
Dr. Benjamin H. Williams, profes-
sor of political science; Dr. John H.
Ferguson, associate professor of eco-
nomics, ‘and Herbert J . Cummings,
graduate student assistant in eco-
nomics and business.

The idea of the meetings, accord-
ing to Mr. Slesinger, is to present
ideas on social problems to students
informally, and to give students the
opportunity to know the faculty
better.

“I want to emphasize,” he said,
“that the meetings are devoted\pri-
marily to the students, not the
faculty.”

Chinese Professor Discusses
Yenching University at Banquet

Dr. William Hung, professor of
history at Yenching,‘ university,
Peiping, China, paralleled the Uni-
versity to the Chinese school at the
initiation ceremony of Phi Alpha
Theta, honorary history fraternity,
in the College club last Saturday.

Having been inducted as an hon-
orary member back in 1930, Dr.
Hung this year witnessed the in-
auguration to the fraternity of Dr.
Oliver H. Elsbree, associate pro-
fessor of history; John Dodds, grad-
uate student; Joan Braelt, C41;
Annie Ross, C41; Harry Law, Jr.,
Ed4l, and Sally Thigpen, C41.

Membership requirements include
at least 18 credits in history with an
average of 2., an interest in stu-
dent activities, and a general 1.
average in all other subjects.

After praising the originality of
the Cathedral of Learning, Dr.
Hung compared the University with
Yenching. Yenching, he revealed,
has modern laboratories, gymna-
siums for men and women, and a
unique recreational center "located
on a small island in a natural lake.

Italian Room

Continued from page one

nounced by Father Di Francesco,
prominent Italian-American pastor.
The prayer will be followed by a
recitation of a few lines of the
poetry of Dante Alighieri, famous
Italian author, by Larry Tornese,
C41, president of the Italian club.

The room itself is described by
Mrs.,Ruth C. Mitchell as “a sym-
bolic manifestation of the spirit of
the Renaissance coupled with the
spiritual atmosphere of the Italian
monasteries, where the learning that
made the Renaissance possible was
kept during the dark ages.”

Plans for the room were orig-
inally designed by Ezio Cerpi, archi-
tect in charge of the restoration of
historical buildings in monuments
in Tuscany, Italy. The ﬁnal plans
and construction of the room were
supervised by Albert Klimcheck,

' University architect.’

The ofﬁcial dedication of the room
has been indeﬁnitely postponed, and

. will come when a fresco, depicting

the ﬁrst woman to be admitted to
an institution of higher learning,
University of Padua, is completed.

The fresco is to be done by Gio-
vanni Romagnoli, foremost Italian
painter of women, and recent win-
ner of the International art exhibit.
V Dr. ‘James Stinchcomb, professor
and head of the department of
classics, and M. A. DeVitis, associ-
ate professor of modern language,
are marshalls.

Checks Check in

Despite Defense

The long-delayed ‘NYA pay
checks‘ have ﬁnally I arrived,‘ the
ﬁrst ones coming in last Saturday.
These cover the ﬁrst working

tween September 23 and October

Robert J. ‘Munce, director of
University NYA and instructor in
sociology, reminds student workers
that these checks do not include
the second period, which ended

believed to have caused the delay
in forwarding of wages from the
local distributing center in Phila-
delphia.

IF Continues
Drive to Help
Needy in City

Although changed somewhat in
form, the annual Interfraternity
council Christmas drive to aid needy
Pittsburgh families will be contin-
ued this year, it was decided at :1
meeting of the executive commit-
tee on Monday. Only monetary
contributions are being requested
this year because the various wel-
fare organizations prefer handling
such donations.

The welfare organization, which
will be selected by the committee,
will then be better equipped to de-
termine the need of each family and
to determine how much shall be
given to each. Every contributor
will receive an account of expendi-
tures of the money which he has
contributed.

Invitations to contribute have
been extended to all organizations
and individuals in the University,
states Walter Renton, M42, Lambda
Chi Alpha, chairman of the com--
mittee in charge.

One hundred per cent cooperation
from some 600 fraternity men has
again been promised. This assur-
ance, along with the help of the
other organizations and individuals
on the campus, is expected to swell
the total food received this year to
a new high.

Contributions should be taken to
the oﬁice of the dean of men, 809
Cathedral, states Robert R. Corley,
assistant dean of men. A thermom-
eter, indicating the progress of the
drive, will be erected in the alcove
off the Commons Room.

General opinion of the committee
was that “the larger the number of
contributors, the larger the ﬁeld
will be for this unexpected Santa
Claus to cover.”

This Evening . . .

at 8 o’clock Dr. Alexander Silver-
man, professor and head of the
chemistry‘ department, will speak
on “Glass: Today and Tomorrow”
in Carnegie Music hall.

Town Meeting

Continued from page one
can we talk about ‘leadership’ when
millions of Americans are ill-fed,
poorly—clothed, and living in dilap-
idated shambles of houses. We’re
in no danger of military invasion,
but we do need economic defense.”

Then Dr. James and Dr. Stotz
launched a dual rebuttal on the
speech of Dr. Williams when they
said “Even if we should make the
internal gains you (Dr. Williams)
spoke of, they would none-the-less
be subjected to pressure brought on
by external conditions.”

Dr. Tyson made his contribution
to the “interventionist” forces on
the panel when he asked Dr. Wil-
liams, “How can we be in a posi-
tion to aid in the securing of a
‘just peace’ after this war if we do
nothing to see that that peace isn’t
dictated by a victorious Axis?”

The biology professor retorted, “If
we remain aloof from the struggle,
and do not subject ourselves to the
prejudices which would naturally
result from participation in such a
struggle, we would be better able-
to suggest, in a cool, unprejudiced,
objective way, a just plan for
peace.”

Dr. Stotz then pointed out that
the United States should not sup-
port a plan similar to the Versailles
treaty which “would give political
freedom to a nation economically
dependent upon a bigger power.”

The non-isolationist case of the
majority of the members on the
panel was best summed up by Dr,
James when he said, “If England
holds out, the United States will be»
virtually assured of peace, but,
should she lose, we will be at war
1 or at least thirty years witha vic--
torious Axis.”

Following the dismissal of the-
meeting by Umble, the discussion,
enthusiasm on both sides running’
high, extended on into the next‘
hour.
