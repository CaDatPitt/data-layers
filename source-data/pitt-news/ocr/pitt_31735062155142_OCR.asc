- Sammy, Theta Chi, ZBT Punished
Three Fraternities on Probation;

Dean of Men’s Off

 (Edt'to'rt'al, Page 4: Face the Facts)

By BOB SMIZJK

Three University frater-
nities — Sigma Alpha Mu,
Theta Chi and Zelta Beta
Tau —- have been placed on so-
cial probation by the Dean of
Men’s office. It was reported that

the probationary periods will last 7

until the start of the winter
trimester.
Although Assistant Dean of

Men and Fraternity Adviser Park--

er Enwright refused to conﬁrm
the probations, The Pitt News
learned of the suspensions from
the presidents of Sarmny and
Theta Chi and an officer of ZBT.

The disciplinary actions came
only one week after Pi Lambda
Phi’s social probation had been

‘ lifted. Pi Lam had been on pro-

bation from September until No-
vember 6*for rushing violations.
Both Ed Mastin, president of
Theta Chi, and Steve Gershman,
president of Sammy, admitted-
their fraternities had been placed
on probation. - _
Jerry Wishy, ZBT president,
offered only a “no comment.”
The statements by Masten and

Gershman were in contrast to

what Dean Enwright had to say.
He said, “I have no comment on

any disciplinary action that may_

or may not have been taken.”
Later, however, he admitted
something was Vwrong when he
said, “Nothing has been ﬁnalized
yet.”

Masten said, “That’s correct,”
when asked if Theta Chi had been
put on social probation. He add-

ed that “the probationary period
is for quite a long time.” But
then he said that it did not last.
past January.

Gershman at ﬁrst refused to

I. comment on the probation, but
later admitted.“we are on proba-

tion. Those things happen.” He
would not say how long the pro-
bationary period lasted.

Neither Masten nor Gershman
would say whether the proba-
tions had anything to do with
the house inspection Dean En-

wright carried out on Homecom-‘

ing weekend. He reportedly vis-
ited every house checking for
violations of interfraternity reg-
ulations on the main ﬂoors and
upstairs.

Inter-fraternity Council Presi-
dent Norm Himes said, “I can
make no comment on what has

happened. Any comment will
have to come from Dean En-
wright or the individual frater-
nities.” it

Although the terms of the pro-
bations 1 have _not" been _made

known, in the past social pro-‘

bation usually meant ’that ‘fra-
ternities were not permitted to
have parties, nor were they per-
mitted to have girls in the house.

The most severe probation
placed on a fraternity in recent
years occurred last November
when Phi Epsilon Pi was placed
on .a tight Ptobation which did
not permit them to have social
events or to participate in athle-
tics. The suspension, which also
threw seven members out’ of
school for a term, was not lifted
until this September.

   

Two — Year Future
Slated for Campus

By AL JANEZIC
The University of Pittsburgh’s new J ohnstown Cam-
pus, said Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld, was never in-

tended as a four-year school.

It was designed, he said, to provide facilities for graduate pro-_
fessional work and for undergraduate work of “two years plus."

The Chancellor replied to an editorial in the J ohnstown Campus
student newspaper last week that claimed the branch college has
been betrayed and pushed down to a two-year level after hopes were
high that it would be .a four-year school.

The editorial asked if the Chancellor has “reneged” on comments
he made there two years ago that suppos-
edly implied a four-year status for the
Johnstown branch.

When contacted on Sunday, Chancellor
Litchﬁeld said that the University has been
planning for “half a dozen years” to build
regional centers as “across the boardVcam-
puses and not merely undergraduate
schools.”

The expanded graduate professional pro-
gram of the new campus, said the Chan-
cellor, will greatly increase the University's
service to the J ohnstown area. But,.he said,
the undergraduate work was “not to be a
complete complemen .”

 

Lltohﬁeld

The dispute arose over the remarks attributed to Chancellor’ A
Litchﬁeld on a visit to Johnstown on Nov. 14, 1962, when he said: ‘ 
“It is most beﬁtting that the biggest single step yet taken in »the_ 

University’s program of regional-service the new plan for_aﬂcoIn-

plete complement.of _facilities for amiddle-sized ‘college.  _

J ohnstown.” »

On the same day, the general campaign chairman of the new
Johnstown Campus drive said: “One of the unfortunate results of

seeking a college education is withdrawal of young people from their
homes in and around Johnstown. They go away to college .
graduated and seek employment elsewhere. This situation can be cor-

rected through an expanded college here. Our young people will be ‘

able to stay at home while attending college . . .”

Remarks such as these apparently have‘ kindled the hopes of .
J ohnstown residents. A top-level J ohnstown Campus administrator ~
remarked that on several occasions Chancellor Litchﬁeld had said:

that there is a “distinct possibility of the J ohnstown Campus becoming
a four-year school.

The Chancellor said Monday, however, that he had no further
comment to make on how ‘the confusion may have occurred. a

“Death” is a late invention in evolution, Harvard Uni-

organisms, as by fission.

Dr. Wald followed the distinc-
tion made by the 19th century
biologist August Weismann by
saying that there exist two “lines”
of cells, the germplasmand soma.
Germplasm is the genetic ma-
terial, and some is all the re-
mainder of the body.

=.In this distinction lies the key
to “the origin of death.” “The
germplasm is immortal; it need
never die,” Dr. Wald said. Then he
added, “Death is the discarding of
the soma.”

Experiments with both rats
and medical students point to
the fact that sexual drive and
hunger can account for a “hun-

rodents leave their normal feed-
ing-grounds as a. gesture of “bio-
logical altruism,” according to Dr.
Wald, as this act best thins out
the population to a size propor-
tional with the available food.
Man’s dreams of “immortality
of the ﬂesh,” Dr. Wald said, are
unfortunate. “We as men have
fallen in love with the soma,” our
mark of individuality, yet “all

behavior is contingent on an un-

conscious realization of mortal-
ity.” In terms of social considera-
tions, life span has not proven

Business Research Bureau
Reports Decrease in Index

The general business index for the city of Pittsburgh fell sharply dur-

ing the ﬁrst week of November.

The Bureau said the index lost 6.4 percentage points, setting it

at 100.6 per cent of the 1957-59 base.

Steel operations in the area, compiled by the" American Iron and
Steel Institute, fell from 130 per cent to 129 per cent, also based on

In 1057-59 average.

An increase in coal production
and a marginal increase in elec-
tric power generation, though,
raised that index from 101. to
101.6 per cent.

Shipments index also advanced,
with gains in the coke, coal, iron,
and steel and river sectors, to
boost the index to 104.4 per cent,
up 3.2 percentage points.

The Bureau said the loss in
the general business index can
be attributed to a decline in car
registrations, a part of the index
trade, which dropped from 117.3
-per cent to 91.6 per cent during
the week.

Gross dollar sales of downtown
department stores for the four
weeks ending November 7 were
6.3 per cent ahead of sales of a
comparable four weeks of 1963.

ALWAYS .

Make sure you have enough
water in the radiotor. And in
the winter add antifreeze. Put
on chains, to have eﬁicient
traction in the snow. Except,
naturally, if you drive a Volks-
wagen. In this case, just turn
the key to start the engine and
drive off. Go and keep going.
This is just ONE reason for
Volkswagen being the leading
import. Far ahead in front of
the rest in performances, ser-
’ vice, and also in resale value,
of course. Call M. W.T.l\/Iotors,

of that media, serves to report what is happening —- everything that is happening as
space and staff permit. Unlike the function of a public relations department it does not
‘ serve to rose-color its coverage. '

A basic distinction — to those who think enough to make it. But unfortunately
part of this college campus which, like any other institution of higher learning, is con-
sidered a pinnacle of American thought, has not taken much time to ponder.

Three fraternities were put on social probation this week and to a newspaper
staff this, along with the Chancellor’s reply to the J ohnstown Campus and a Philosophy

of Science lecture on death, are part of what is happening at this school at this time.
It is our intention neither to scandalize the Greek system nor to pretend that we heard
-nothing of the story. Both are unfai'r to our readers. Both deny our fulﬁlling our re-

sponsibility.

Unfortunately the people involved do not see it this way. It is news if the Inter-
fraternity Council sets up a scholarship fund. It is gossip if three out of the fourteen
fraternities on campus are put on social pro. It is news when the Midday Series pre-

, sents Albert Burke. It is scandal when a professor refuses to attend a luncheon fo-r
 Burke because he doesn’t want to be associated with his ideology. _ ‘

When the IFC case was investigated, two people hung up on the reporter. This
was none of his business, they told him. But when was The Pitt News going to cover
more of their philanthropic programs? Typically, they had turned The Pitt News into

' a service organization, a public relations sheet, a naive account of college life — how

 

stimulating everything is academically, how much healthy fun is had at all social func-

tions, how smoothly all administrative functions —— such as registration — go every

brisk, red and gold fall.

But’ wait —— a story on registration problems is good, basic news to the complain-
ing student though scandal to the Office of Student Records. It all depends on your
viewpoint. From our standpoint, what is happening is news. Lack of co-operati‘on
might mean distortion which, if the people involved would think about it, could be even
more harmful to their own selfish ends.

Innovator Needed

 

  Your Move, Mr. President

A -‘Lyndon Johnson’s sweep-‘

infg victory, although it was
less a mandate for the Pres-
ident’s program than it was
a massive endorsement of
the politics of moderation,
produced even greater Dem-
ocratic majorities in both
houses of the Congress. The
Democrats, while maintain-
 , ing their two-to-one Senate
‘ majority, managed to cap-
ture an addi-
tional 40 seats
in the House
of Represen-
tatives. There
would seem
to be more
than a kernel
of truth in
Richard Ro-
 vere’s faceti-
SCIILOSSER ous remark
"that ours has become a “one-
and-a-half party system”;
but, as was proven in 1937-
1938, mathemati'cal majorit-
ies do not mean, ipso facto,
vworkable majorities. Thus,
. if this next congressional
. session is to be a fruitful
one, vigorous and prudent
, leadership must continue to
-. be exerted by the President.

Among House liberals
there is bound to be agita-
» tation for rules changes. The
White House, through its si'-
lence, has given tacit ap-
proval to the much discuss-
” ed proposal to “purge” Rep.
[John Bell Williams of Mis-
. sissippi and Rep. Albert
 Watson of South Carolina,
 two conservative Democrats
 who openly supported Sen-
ator Barry Goldwater for
president.

Democrats have urged - that

 

the pa.rty caucus be strength-
tened and delegated more
power in selecting commit-
tee chairmen, that a 21-day
limi't be imposed on the
Rules Committee to prevent
obstructionist tactics, and
that each congressman be
required to issue a public
statement of his assets.
These recommendations,
which constitute an ambi-
tious and highly desirable
set o_f rules changes, can be
realized only if the Presi-
dent commits himself to
such reforms.

Medical care for the aged,
financed through the social
security "system, is appar-
ently getting top priority by
the Johnson Administration.
Wilbur Mills, - chairman of
the omnipotent House Ways
and Means Committee, has
announced that he will not
delay action on the bill. This,
coupled with the huge Dem-
ocratic majority, would
seem to assure prompt pas-
sage of the medicare legis-
lation.

It is one thing to engineer
the enactment of the Ken-
nedy medical care proposal,
but it is another matter to
develop original solutions to
the problems of education,
poverty, and tax reform. To
eliminate the gross inequi-
ties in our tax structure, to
breakthe cycle of poverty,
to formulate a national edu-
cation policy — these are
some of the questions with
which Lyndon Johnson will
be confronted in domestic
affairs.

In Viet Nam the United
States must sooner or later

make the inevitable choice

       
 

By Allan Schlosser

between a policy of: active
involvement and a policy of
withdrawal. The present
American posture vis-a-vis
Viet Nam, which might be
described as one of “peri-
pheral security,” is not only
untenable but dangerous.

IN NEGOTIATIONS with
our European allies, Wash-
ington stubbornly insists
that they adopt the multi-
lateral nuclear force, which
is utterly incompatible with
their national interests. Gen-
eral de Gaulle, of course,
emphatically rejects the
MLF on the grounds that
the United States would not,
in the event of a thermonu-
clear war, come to the de-
fense of Western Europe.
The MLF, one fears, is at

best a naive construct of the

same American minds which
manufactured the myth of
the “Atlantic Community.”
Charles de Gaulle, so often
accused of excessive nation-
alism and megalomania, re-
mains the only Western lead-
er who has consistently un-
derstood the realities of in-
ternational relations (e.g.,
regarding the inherent ana-
chronisms of NATO an-d the
emergence of an indepen-
dent West Europe).

In short, President J ohn-
'son’s .legi'sl:ative successes
during the last session of
the Congress were largely
tactical; that is to say, he
applied his energies to en-
acting John Kennedy's rec-
ommendations. In the next
Congress, Lyndon Johnson
will necessarily be cast into
the dual role of tactician
and innovator.‘

Gives Opinion
Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to comment on
Allan Schlosser’s generally per-
ceptive article (The Pitt News,
Nov. 11) dealing with the repeal
of California's fair housing law.

One implication of the article
was that the “lunatic right wing”
and the “vested real estate in-
terest” passed Proposition 14, but
the fact is that many “good and
decent” people voted for it. Even
allowing for ambiguity in the
wording of the proposition, it

_ seems that white backlash was

operative. However, white back-
lash is not new, it’s just that
new white people are aware of it,
too.

Until 1963, California had no
fair housing law and many states
still do not. The laws in existence
in states like Pennsylv.ania are
generally inadequate and not
really enforced, in spite of the
good intentions of many sincere
people. Urban renewal, that pana-
cea of liberals in the 40’s, has
become little more than Negro
removal as cities and states fail
to deal with the conditions that
cause ghettos. The city of Pitts-
burgh owns numerous dwellings
that don’t meet the standards of
its own housing code. And so on,
ad nauseam.

It seems that there are areas
in which our democracy does not
function too well, and white
America is just beginning to dis-
cover that fact. Mr. Schlosser
states that since the franchise
failed justice, the courts must be
consulted. Without questioning
this necessity, one must ask:
What happens if the courts rule
against the appeal? Are we sup-
posed to be good sports, sit back,
and wait for “the man” to get
religion?

Editor, The Pitt News:

The reader was particularly
disturbed by the exaggerations
and distortions in the editorial
“California Calamity” by Allan
Schlosser. By what standard’ does

Mr. Schlosser appoint himself the

Letters To The Editor

, judge of California's maturity? Is

   

   
  
    
        
      
   

it because the people disagreed
with Mr. Schlossers philosophy
on this issue? Would he place
the majority of the citizens of
California in the extremist cate-
gory because they voted for Pro-
position 14? We think not.

But neither can he blame its
passage on the contention that it
was phrased misleadingly with-
out indicting the democratic pro-
cess requiring a responsible elec-
torate. “

M. Schlosser slurs Cardinal
McIntyre for being one of the
few- clergymen who realize that
he should be trying to improve
the moral attitude of his people
from ‘the pulpit, rather than hav-
ing_ his problem conveniently
legislated away with no real
change in public attitude.

Mr. Schlosser blasted Senator
Goldwater for hypocrisy on the
issue, yet in California this “mat-
ter of local concern” was left up
to the people, whereas in New
York it was not. Senator Gold-
water, I am sure, would have
been satisﬁed had the New York
school bus question been subject
to public referendum. This mere-
ly points up the fact that gov-
ernment is being taken from the
people as if they were not quali-
ﬁed to decide their own future.

Mr. Schlosser’s . guilt by asso-
ciation policy of tying conserva-
tism to right wing radicalism be-
cause of their agreement on cer-
tain issues is ludicrous. It is
analogous to tying liberalism to
communism because- both ideo-
logies preach absolute social
equality.

The right to economic pursuit
is the backbone of our advanc-
ing civilization.

The civil rights problem must

‘ be taken at the roots, by improv-

ing the morals of the populace,
so that the majority of Americans
will approve of these laws. This
is the only true and lasting solu-
tion. In the meantime, remember
this government is still of the
majority.

Johannes Brahms finish-
ed his Third Symphony at
Wiesbaden in the summer
of 1883. It was one of the
happiest periods of his life.
He was fifty years old, se-
cure in fame, and, from his let-
ters, practically tripping over
melodies in the countryside. His
Third Symphony quite naturally
renders this exuberant mood. It
is free ﬂowing, reminiscent of
Beethoven's Sixth, and is char-
acterized by the notes F, A ﬂat,
F, Frie aber Froh (“Freed but
happy”), which are heard at once

in the opening measures.
Unhappily, Leopold Stokowski’s
rendition of Bram’s Third, at the
Pittsburgh Symphony in Syria
Mosque this week-end, seemed to
overlook all this. Whereas the
opening movement should have
been as serene as Brahms himself
must jiave felt while writing it,
Stokowski saw ﬁt to state the
principal F, A ﬂat, F theme in a
rather erratic fashion, and then
continued to consistently change

tempos every chance he had. The
resultant movement, instead of
being a uniﬁed whole, was ununi-
ﬁed .and spasmodic, more like
the city than the countryside.

In the second and third move-
ments, Stokowski, who served as
guest conductor, seemed nearer
to Brahms’ intentions. Especially
in the Poco allegretto did Stokow-
ski capture the wistful quality
of the main theme, which is one
of those rare creations that can
triumph in anyone’s interpreta-
tion.

Whatever Stokowski accom-
plished in the second and third
mt.-veaments he completely des-
troyed in (the last, however. This is

.the only movement in the sym-

phony where real power and ten-
sion is required, so that the beauty
of the second theme can clearly
rise above the tension created in
theﬁrst. But here, where Stokow-
ski could have used all the gusto he
so badly misused in the ﬁrst
movement, he saw ﬁt to restrain
the orchestra so that the subor-
dinate theme could only meekly

lift its head for passing recogni.

THE BIG BLONDI  

By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ
Panther linebacker Marty Schottenheimer has the same affinity

.for ball carriers that sulphuric acid has for sugar. When sulphuric

acid and sugar are mixed, the acid seeks out the molecules of water
in the sugar and destroys the sugar, leaving nothing but a charred
mass of cinder. After being hit by Schottenheimer, some ball carriers

feel the same way.

Army coach Paul Dietzel praised the Panthers’ linebacking, al-
though he refused to single out Schottenheimer. “Their linebackers
are good,” he said. “They seem to be all over the ﬁeld.”

e Included in that “they” was Schottenheimer. When quarterback
Carl Stichweh ran to his left, he ran into Schottenheimer. When he
ran to his right, Schottenheimer caught him from behind. That’s the
kind of lateral movement the pro scouts like to see in a football player.
It’s the kind of lateral movement that should make him all-America.

Notre Dame coach Ara Parseghian praised Schottenhe-imer’s play

against the Irish two weeks ago. “He’s a helluva ballplayer,” Parseg-

hian said. “He played a good game against us.”

Parseghian should know how good Pitt's big blond is. In the ﬁrst

A. “quarter Notre Dame likes to single out the opposition’s defensive ball-

player and run right at him, ﬁguring if they can run through the
opposition’s best, the rest will come easily, and the game is won early.
_That’s why the Irish ran right at Schottenheimer in the ﬁrst
quarter. “That’s the ﬁrst time I can ever remember a team running
right at me like that,” Schottenheimer said. “They usually try to go
to one side of me, but never right at me.”. . .
Schottenheimer should be all-America. If he doesn't make it,

The cross-country team
finished ninth in the IC4A
championships held Monday
in New York City’s Van
Cortland Park. Georgetown
won the meet with N otre
Dame, Villanova, and Michi-
gan State placing second, third,
and‘ fourth respectively in a ﬁeld
of 23 collegiate teams.

The ﬁrst Panther to ﬁnish was
Dave Eichenlaub. He took 15th
with a time of 25:56. Damien
Koch ran -llst, Frank I-Landelman
ended up 46th, with Fran Shor
67th and John Bailey 86th in a
ﬁeld of 250 runners.

The race was won in 24:41 by
a Notre Dame runner.

The harriers were in good posi-
tion for the ﬁrst mile. There
were ﬁve Panthers in the top 30
after that ﬁrst leg. According to
Captain Bailey, the team was
then in good position to win the

 

meet. However, the extremely
fast pace wore down the runners
during the second and third miles
-of the ﬁve mile race.

The harriers beat many good
teams including Syracuse, Army
and NYU. Penn State, however
(defeated by the Panthers dur-
ing the -season), topped them by
three points. Bailey attributed
this to the fast pace set by the
superior teams. “We tried to stay
with a pace that we weren’t ac-
customed to and it told on us,”
he said. He noted that only Eich-
enlaub kept a steady pace and he
placed 15th, coming from behind.
Bailey felt that if each harrier
had run his normal race “we
would have all been in the top
35.”

The mild, misty weather play-
ed no factor in ‘the outcome:
Bailey said that the track wasn’t
too tough despite the narrow

By FRANK SIVIIZIK
Coach Paul D-eitzel of Army is having as much trouble
beating the Panthers as he does beating Navy. For the
second time in two years the Panthers over-powered the
Army defense. The Panthers have scored 52 points to the

Cadets’ eight.

In the last two games this season the Panthers have

made impressive showings. Coach
John Michelosen gives much of
the credit to the offensive line.
“Any time that the team has
been moving the ball like we
have been doing it is because of
the offensive line,” explained
Michelosen.

The offensive line has given
the Panther runners bigger holes
to run through, and the. ground
game has been much more suc-
cessful as a result.

Faulty play and Penn State
challenge the soccer team tomor-
row at 2:30 p.m. at the Stadium.
The booters’ lack of fundamental
skills has hampered their attack,
while losing them four consecu-
tive games.

In their last two games, the
booters have outshot the op-
ponent, 33-19, while being out-
scored 5-2. They made 10 per cent
of their shots, and Bucknell made
33 per cent of their shots, as
Bucknell beat them Saturday.

“A good shooting percentage
is 20 per cent,” said Maryland

coach Doyle Royal. The booters‘

have shot six per cent in their
last two games.

The booters lack proﬁcency in
the fundamental skills of pass-
ing, shooting, and trapping. “We
just don’t have ﬁnished ball play-
ers on our squad,” said coach
Leo Bemis. “They lack the high-
ly developed skills our opponents
have had in the last three games.”

Poor shooting was obvious in
the second game of the season
when they outshot West Chester,
but lost, 3-2. “Our problem wasn’t
getting through their defense,”
said Bemis after the game, “but
it was scoring once we had the
ball.” -

When the booters beat West
Virginia, 3-1, in the fourth sea-
son contest, their shooting was
still inefficient. “Our shots either
went over the net or at the

goalie,”
McNulty.
This fallacy is not inherent in
the players, but has been aggra-
vated by Bemis’ coaching. “I
should have worked the team
more Kon basic skills,” admitted
Bemis. “I assumed they had suf-
ﬁcient skills and ﬁnesse, but they
don’t.” *

Penn State has a 4-4 record
and must win tomorrow to gain
a winning season. Despite their
record, the Nittany Lions beat
Bucknell 8-0, and lost close de-

T. R. Thomsen, B.S.M.E., University of Nebraska,

important to him was the fact that our young engi-
neers play vital roles right from the start, working
on exciting engineering projects in communica-
tions including: electronic switching, thin film cir-
cuitry, microwave systems and optical masers.

Western Electric’s wide variety of challenging

, Professor Parker, who is the
E * visiting Andrew Mellon professor-
of romance languages and litera-
ture, took issue with English and
French literary critics who tend’
to ignore the contributions of the
Spanish in the area of the pi-
caresque novel.
He described “a tacit conspira-
, oy of, critics of French and Eng-
lish novels to ignore contributions
of the Spanish novel.”

Parker explained how “realism
was ushered in with the Spanish
picaro” and how this led to the
birth of English and French real-
ism, seen. in novels such as Moll
Flanders. by Defoe, and Gil Blas,
by Lesage.

Parker also attacked those crit-
ics of the picaresque novel who
I feel there is an “incompatibility
of the novel and moral beliefs

his eye open, but it is against his

 
  
      
  
   
 
  

   . Spanish Novel Monday

By FRED FRANK
Professor Alexander Parker opened the Mellon Lecure
Series Monday night by discussing the area of “The Picar-

esque Novel In Spain.” Professor Parker called the Span-
ish picaresque novel a significant -example of “the explora- ‘

tion of the problem of deliquency.”
A picaresque novel is a type of prose of Spanish ori-

tragic character torn against him-
se .”

Summarizing his point, Parker
emphasized that in this period
(16th to 17th century) “Spanish
literature shifts away from hu-
man values to recognition of the

basic weakness of the human be- »

ing.”

Parker, professor of hispanic
studies at the University of Edin-
bore, and considered an expert
in the Golden Age of Spanish,
Literature, will give a second lec-
ture Thursday on “Literature and
the Deliquent.”
