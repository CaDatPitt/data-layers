BOYNTO-N,‘ Percy H.: -SOME
CONTEMPORARY AMERI-
CANS. ' ' ..
Many of -_us after reading a

book. would like to know some-
thing about the author and his
other work. This little book
gives us just the added infor-
mation’ we want. - v ’

‘ COE, George‘A.: WHAT AILS
OUR YOUTH?"  ‘
“No simple formula will do

justice to the situation of mod-_

ern young people. Youth is ai-1:,
ing, yet‘ the ailment is not spe-

ciﬁcally a disease of youth but ,

of a general social order that is

out of order. ..The purpose of
the book is -to achieve a sym-
pathetic understanding.” _

COHEN, Helen L.: ONE ACT

,PLAYS BY_.MODERN AU-
THORS. ' .. —
“The one act play; is admira-

ble in itself,.as a medium of art. 1

It “shows thesame relation to

the; full-length playas the short-

story’ shows—to'tl_1e novel. The

. method. ofthe one act play at

. its best is similar to ‘the-method
employed by. Browning in his v
dramatic monologues.“ . ‘
FRANK, Glenn: AN AMERI-

CAN LOOKS AT HIS

WORLD.’ ' -

“A seriesof lectures given to
the faculty and studentsof the
University of Delaware. The
author is a man of discriminat-
ing judgment and sensitive to
the inﬂuences that are "sweeping

. through ‘America and the world.
Not only has he the‘ ability to
think but the powerof compe1l- _
ing others to think.”
HERRICK. Frances H.:

BON THE NATURALIS-'1‘.

Vols. _ .

“Audubon. was one of ‘ those
rare spirits -whose post-humus

‘ famehas grown with the years.

. He did ‘one. thing in particular,
that of making known to ‘the
’ world the birds of his adopted ‘
land, and did it so well that his’
’ name will be held in everlasting .
remembrance. His great folios
are now the property of the rich
or of those fortunate institu-

— tions which have either received
them by gift or were enrolled -
among his original ‘subscribers
and wherever found they are
treasured as the greatest of
show, books.” A set of these-
folios is contained in the Wil-
liam and Mary Darlington Me-
morial Collection of the Univer-
sity Library. and will be shown 1
upon request to any one inter-
ested in these rare and bea.uti- .
ful volumes. ’

LANG, Andrew: POETICAL

‘ WORKS OFANDREW LANG. .
4 Vols. A '
“My mind is gay but my soul -

is melancholy,” so the author

once said of ‘himself; and it is
this union of gaiety and melan-
choly that gave him his person-
ality. No collection of his -verses
could therefore be complete and

_ representative which did not"
draw from both these sources.
PUPIN, Michael: FROM IMMI-

GRANT TO INVENTOR.

“The inventor of the “Pupin
coils” arrived in this country -
with only five cents in his

= pocket and admitted to the im-
migrant officials that the only
Americans he knew were Lin-
coln, Franklin and Harriet
Beecher Stowe.”

STEELE, Wilbur D.: LAND’S
END AND OTHER STORIES.
“The author ﬁnds as much

drama in the life of the Portu-

guese ﬁshermanon Cape Cod as ‘

Conrad has found in the south-

ern seas. It is safe to say that

the rich human‘ embodiment of ~
the stories’ collected in this vol-
ume assure them a permanence

- in our literature.-” "

“Last week this University of‘
‘Nebraska celebrated ‘Engineers’
Week’ which is an .annual affair.
The week ‘given over largely _to_
engineering activities. “A ‘Pep"‘
rally early in the week, a ﬁeld, ’
day on Tuesday, the parade on
Wednesday. On Thursday even-
ing the -various‘ engineering lab-
orataries were all open to the
public and an exhibition of the
work of the various departments.
This ‘begins about 7:30 and from
that time until -10:00 the build-
ings are visited by several thou-
sand pcople, The week endswith
a dance on Friday and‘ a ban-'
quet on Saturday. The events of
the whole week are planned and
carried out by the students.

“One of my young instructors
who is teaching some of the work
in architectural engineering sug-
gested to the students in this
subject that they make a model
of some building showing a type
of modern architecture to  used
as the ﬂoat» in the parade for
the Architectural Engineering "J
Department. You will at’ once
recognize the model chosen, On
account of‘ possible interference
with trolley wires it was not
practical to make the model the
full 52 stories.” ‘
Enclosed with the letter was a

newspaper clipping telling of the en-

gineering parade referred to and» a

photograph of the model. This,is
