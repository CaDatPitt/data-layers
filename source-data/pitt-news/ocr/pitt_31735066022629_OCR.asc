Provisions Mode For Pitt's Disabled

By KAREN TAROLLI
Pitt News Staff Writer

The following list can be found in
Roget's ‘International Thesaurus to
describe two words: “Impaired,
weak, incapacitated, cripple,
unable, incompetant, inadequate,
inept, unfit, defective, and yes,
even idiot and imbecile.” '

Surprisingly, those “negative”

words are synonyms for handicap- '

ped and disabled. According to
Tom Galante, the Coordinator for
Disabled Student Services, these’
people are “students first, their
disability is second.” Fortunately, a
large percentage of the students and
faculty here at Pitt see things
Galante’s way.

Though there are few blind,‘deaf,
or wheelchair students, the campus
has made accommodations for
them.‘ The housing office
guarantees housing in the specially
equiped rooms in Tower C, and
Bruce and Forbes Halls. Special ac-
commodations range from lowered
mirrors and light switches to
modified doors and table phones.

Over the past year and a half, the
University has spent $180,000 to
put curb cuts in the sidewalks
within the campus for students in
wheel chairs. ‘But access within the
community is still very difficult and
sometimes impossible. Galante
said, “people are in an island situa-
tion.”

Once the student leaves the cam-
pus, traveling is almost impossible.
The city has agreed to put curb cuts
in Fifth and Forbes Avenues, and
from Craig Street to McKee Place
to make transportation more conve-
nient.

Many of the handicapped
students ,,that atte_nd Pitt commute
from their homes, where they have
families and jobs aside from being a
student. But for those who are
residents, campus life is very similar
to the community. Because the
students are integrated within the
university so well, the crossover to
community living is easier accord-
ing to Galante. '

The office for Disabled Students
Services has several work-studv

;

students, and a number of
volunteers. These people are there
to aid deaf, blind, and wheel chair
students in any way that is needed.
Aside from reading tests to blind
students and interpreting lectures
for the deaf, the office is also ac-
tively ‘involved in recruting. han-
dicapped students from area high
schools, according to Galante.

ltseems that many high school
counselors are not aware of the ser-
vices that are provided for the han-
dicapped at Pitt; Dawn Gideon, a
recruiter assistant, has spoken by
phone to high school counselors
and handicapped students of the
available services.

 -

There won’t be any “dirty” conversation in this telephone booth, thanks
to the elbow grease provided by this hard worker.

“Many counselors told me that
the student wanted to attend a
smaller campus because it would
have better services,” Gideon said.
Their lack of information kept
them from applying to Pitt, she ad-

ded.
CORRECTION

In Monday’s edition of the Pitt
News, the quote attributed to
Tom Onieal when he referred to
the Afghanistan peasants as
“heroin peddlers and oppressors
of women’s rights” should have
been attributed to Rob Toy of
the Young Socialist Alliance.

Taking Care
Of Business

 Congratulations are in order to the newly elected

f members of the College of General Studies Student
*' , Cabinet Council. The newly elected president Tom

Hajduk and his four council members—Dave Huff-
ner, Cheryl Tomko, Mary Hagan and Mary
Phillips—will represent the night school students
during the coming year‘.

"One of the newly elected official’s chief concerns is
the image of CGS, formerly the School of General

 

Studies. The Council members already have a head
start since the school’s name was recently changed.
The night school has endured years of misconcep-
tion by those enrolled in CAS and other day pro-
grams as well as local employers. People seem to
think thequality of education offered by the college
is lower than that of “normal” higher education pro-
grams. ~ »

This perception, of course, is false, in that the
night school offers basically the same programs as
does the College of Arts and Science. The main dif-
ference in the two schools is that one convenes at

' nightiwhile the other operatesduring the day.

The new council andits president will have a tough
job ahead of them since this misconception of CGS
has existed so long. y

There are other issues that the CGS Student
Cabinet Council must deal with.

Like all university student bodies, there is a pro-
blem with apathy.'Apathy, in its most obvious form,

occurred during the CGS election as evidenced by the
voter turnout. Only approximately 300 voters took
part in the election, a mere fraction of the entire CGS
student body.

A solution to the problem of apathy is communica-

tion. And, perhaps the best way to open up the com- f

munication channels between CGS students and the
council is to quickly reinstate the publication Night

Times, which folded earlier in theterm, mainly due

to financial difficulties.

The Night Times, as described by CGS leaders, is
the official organ of the Student Cabinet Council.
Since its (temporary) demise, night students have
been without an effective source of valuable informa-
tion. Reestablishing the Night Times will alleviate
this problem. I

There are other problems of course but the three
listed above may well be the. most important. .We

hopethe newly elected Council members serve their

constituency well and we wish them good luck.

 Letters

I am writing again to the Pitt
News, this time in response to Mark

I Collins, CAS.

Mr. Collins seems not able to see

. the forest for the trees. This is evi- .
I dent in his critical letter wherein he

tries to be logical, but falls on his
face!

If ‘Mr. Collins will re-call, there '
-. was one word which was in large
.__capital letters: Involvement._ That,
 Collins was my theme. Not

anywhere did I say, or mean to imp-

" ly, that the right to disagree has

been or will be abridged.

My intention, which eluded Mr."

Collins, was to point out that while
we are at a University, we should
try to milk this experience for all it

I‘ offers. Later in life we will use these

experiences to guide ourselves in
making decisions. How we ac-

us later on. .
When you have a complain
about a service or a product, do you
ask to see the manager, or phone
him, or write to him a letter? If you
do, I’m sure you will get results
and/or the attention you deserve.
Or do you complain- to your
neighbor, or to your roommate?

Certainly the latter ‘action cures.

your frustration, but does it solve
the matter? Of course, it doesn't!

The point is, Mark, that personal
visits, personal letters, personal
phone messages are universally
given more weight, than comments
made to vent frustration. This is ap-
plicable to life far after you
graduate from this institution.

Despite your Militant-type,

fewer than show up at a good

It looks like the well-planned at-

Bring Back ,

Grgurich. I

This letter is being written in
what we feel is the best interest of
both the University of Pittsburgh
and its recently rvesigned basketball
coach, Tim Grgurich. It is the direct
result of a specially held executive
board meeting this date.

Our growing membership
represents well over 20 basketball
coaches working at high school,
junior college, college and universi-
ty levels. We speak for the entire
spectrum of basketball coaching in

complished “this and that” will aid I

nuing efforts to bring unity to the
sport in this area.

Since we know the capabilities,
character, dedication and loyalty
(especially to Pitt) of this man we
find it appalling that the athletic ad-
ministration at that school has
taken such a negative stance concer-
ning this matter. Pitt has definitely
lost the support of the silent majori-
ty of coaches, players, and fans
who know how effectively Tim
Grgurich ' has- represented his
university in the entire tri-state
area. He has, through endless sum-
mer camps, caused literally
thousands of kids to come to know
and identify with Pitt basketball.

The decision of the Pitt ad-
ministrative hierarchy not to sup-
port Tim Grgurich and the Pitt
basketball program he worked so

hard to develop will have a negative ,

public relations effect upon the
University for years to come. It is
inconceivable how little they know
or care about the tremendous sell-
ing job he has done for his school.

More incongrous is the fact that a
$25,000 per year job can mushroom
into a $40,000 per year job in the
space of 4 or 5 days. Tim Grgurich
bled for his University and his
players. Is his reward to have some
outsider come in to replace him who
has no vested interest in Pitt or the
kids of greater Pittsburgh other
than the color of the money of-
fered?

By MARK NITOWSKI
Pitt News Staff Writer
* Each spring, hordes \of college
students spend their Easter break
roaming the beaches of Florida, fre-
quenting famous watering holes like

i “The Button”’and the “Playpen

South,” or just soaking up the hot
Florida sun. It’s no wonder then
that members of the Panther
baseball team were seen happily
squeezing their sunglasses and golf‘
_clubs in along with their equipment
before setting off early Monday
morning for the Deland Recreation

. Invitational Baseball Tournament,»

hosted by F1orida’s Stetson Univer-
sity. But, for one.particular Pan-
ther, the trip to Stetson won’t be
any vacation—it’ll be more like a
homecoming. ‘

“‘Stetson’s six hours from my
house,” said Panther junior Rich
Kline. “My parents will be coming
up. Just to be back home fora
while will be nice.”

One of northern college
baseball’s most serious drawbacks
is bad weather, which was never
more apparent than during the Pan-
thers’ futile excursion to Navy last
weekend. The Panthers were blown
out, not by‘ the Middies, but by the
50 mph winds that happened to
grace Annapolis. However, Kline
sees no reason for the Panthers to

worry about any type of cancella-I

tions down south. ,

“We might not get rain one
day,” predicted the Miami‘ resident.
“This time of the year is
beautiful. ’ ’

What concerns Kline the most is

that the warm wonderful Florida.
sun might turn out to be his team- '

mates worst enemy.

“It’s going to be a lot hotter than
people think. It will take a lot out
of our pitchers and catchers. After
innings I can
guarantee they’ll be tired,” warned

' Kline.

4 “It’s going to be real sticky,” he
added. “The sun here and the sun
in Florida are really different——it
just beats down on you. This time
of the year it might as well be sum-
mer.’_’

With all the talk of the balmy
summer weather, it may be a

wonder why Kline would even think '

of spending his college days here in
Pittsburgh.

“Part of my family is originally
from Pittsburgh,” said Kline. “My

Louisville Defeats UCLA in Toumey ﬁnals

The Louisville Cardinals, behind
the strong play of senior Darrell
Griffith, defeated the UCLA Bruins
Monday night, 59-54, to win their
first NCAA Tournament. The
game was close throughtout, with
the final score being the widest

» margin of the game. -

Early on, both teams were very
cold, missing easy jump shots and
layups. UCLA led’at halftime

_28-26 but both teams shot under 40
percent from the floor for the half.
UCLA led on the strength of

8-for-8 free throw shooting, com-
pared to 4-for-9 for Louisville.
The game had a quick pace as
UCLA’s freshman speedster Rod
Foster_ ran all over the court enroute
to 16 points, leading Bruin scorers.

,Griffith is another speedster who

has 42-inch vertical jump and led all

scorers with 23. No other Cardinal.

player finished in double figures.
UCLA’s senior Kiki Vandeweghe
did not havean outstanding game,
although he scored 14 points
toward the Bruin effort. ‘ He was

not in the offense early on and
seemed to be stumbling around the
court-, ultimately blowing an easy
layup which could have put the
game away for the Bruins.

With 4:32 left in the game,
UCLA’seemed to be well in control
as Vandeweghe scored to put the
Bruins up by four points. But Grif-

fith took charge and about a minute ‘

later, with the Bruin defense flock-
ing around him, Griffith flipped the
ball to Jerry Eaves for-an easy 16
footer. ’ ' 1 " "

The next Louisville possession
resulted in Eaves slicing through the
defense for a layup which tied the
game. UCLA coach Larry Brown
answered that with a timeout to try
to slow down the Cardinal momen-
tum. ‘_

UCLA came out of the timeout
and immediately turned the ball
over as senior James Wilkes threw_
an errant pass off the‘ inbound play.

squad raises the question of how
much better the quality of amateur
baseball might be in the southern
part of the country. '
“Here in Pittsburgh, it’s football

"and basketball,” said Kline, “in

Florida it’s football and baseball.
There are leagues all year round,
and it’s possible to play in three
leagues at a‘time..

“It’s not talent at all,” continued
Kline, “because wherever you go,
you’re going to. find .good players.
It’s just that they're outside and it’s
so popular. They’re just more
polished.” .

So what’s in store for the Pan-
thers in the Sunshine State? Kline

wasn’t_ around when Pitt traveled to 

a comparable tourney in California
a few years back, but he’s willing to
wager that the Panthers will fare i‘
better this time around.

“The thing in California is that .
they invited a lot of teams that were ‘
baseball oriented; a couple schools
from the west coast and teams with
real good programs like Missouri,”
said Kline. “That was some of the
best competition in the nation.

“Stetson’s different. They’re in-
viting northern teams to come‘_.«
down—-more or less to help the nor-
thern teams. Stetson, like any other
Florida team, is willing to play
anybody, just to get the games in
before (NCAA) tournament time,”
added Kline.

According to Kline, though, Stet-
son won’t be the only team in the
Deland tournament prepping itself
for a legitimate shot at an NCAA
bid. -

“The thing I like most about our
team is that we’ve got the ex-
perience,-” said Kl-ine. “A lot of the
guys that came in my freshman year .
are still here. We have a good
nucleus. We also have the pitching;
it’s just a question of whether it will
hold up. If we get the pitching
throughout the season I do think
we'll win. The hitting and the good
defense are already there.”

As for Kline personally, throw
away the stat book; his mind is set
on one goal—and one goal only.

“The only thing I’m concerned

‘about is for us to win and get into‘

‘the NCAA’s,” he said. ,“I know

’ we’ve got the team to do it. I really

don’t care about my average or any

type of statistics. When I’m up at .

the plate I want to get my job‘ done,
whether it’s bunting the guy to
second base or a big hit that can’
knock in a few runs. I'm a team

«player and I want to do something

to‘ help the team because I know we

= have.the guys to win. this year.”.

By The Associated Press
BRADENTON, Fla.—Manager
Chuck Tanner got some unexpected
help early in the 1979 season. Tan-
ner’s Pirates acquired shortstop
Tim Foli from the New York Mets
for veteran Frank Traveras. .
' What did this mean in Pitt-
sburgh’s drive to the National
League East pennant?
“Foli was the glue we needed to

it solidify our defense in the infield,”

Tanner said. “I’m not down
grading Taveras. He’s a fine player.
But he was erratic in the field.”

A veteran of 10 major league
seasons, Foli not only provided
good defense and worked in concert
with second baseman Phil Garner

on defense, he hit .291, 42 points-

over his lifetime average.

“Foli does the ordinary things ex-
traordinary,” said Tanner at the
Pittsburgh spring training camp.

“He makes all the playsat short-
stop, makes the double play better
than anybody in baseball. He comes
across the bag, has a strong, ac-
curate arm and ‘is not afraid to
make the play in a crowd.”

How does Tanner account for

‘ Foli’s emergence as a hitter after

years of frustration at the plate?
“When he came over from the
New York Mets, we weren’t wor-
ried about his hitting. We wanted
his defense. But we changed his
swing from a long‘ to a short
stoke,” Tanner said.
Can he expect Foli to do it again
in 1980?
-“Why not?” asked Tanner.-
“He’s the same ball player. He
and Garner are more familiar. I
guess if he hasganother good season
they’ll say he can’t.do it again.”
Foli has a fine knowledge of
baseball which probably is why his

teammates wrote .“Mgr” manager
in front of his name on the top of
his locker. .

“Aw, they’re just practical
jokers,” insisted Foli. “They write
something on top of »everybody’s
1ocker.”

Foli says playing with- a world
championship team has boosted his
morale after a career with mostly
also-ran clubs.

“People over here know how to
win, what it takes to win, and I
guess I just became part of’ it. It’s

    Added DImensionFor Pirates  

no complicated thing. If we stay
healthy we’ll do it again,” Foli
predicted. _a'_’\,

Foli refuses to worry about the
doubters who say he can’t repeat his
1979 performance.

I Bruins Bow at Handsof Cardinals  

(Continued from page 7)
Denny Crum proceeded to call a
timeout and put the Cardinals in a
slow-down offense. That backfired
as Tony Branch took the pass and
fell, resulting in a jump ball with
Mike Sanders. ’ '

The 6-foot-6 Sanders easily won
the tip but it went right to
Louisville’s Wiley Brown, in easy
position for a layup. Vandeweghe
challenged Brown and came up with
the money block. Unfortunately for
the Bruins, the ball went out of

pool, including distance swimmers
Brian Goodell and Bobby Hackett.

“There will be good sprinters in
the 50- and 100-meter events,” said
Winkler. “The times should be
very quick.”

Greg Louganis, a silver medalist
in the 1976 Olympic Games, returns
to defend his title in the sprint
events and will be challenged by
Carter, who is third best in the na-

ticrnat the present time. Swanson, ‘

a ieturning all-America is ranked
ninth nationally and will hope to
repeat once again this year.
“We’re expecting big things from
everyone,” said Winkler. “I’m
hoping to make the top 12 divers,”

he added.

' For Winkler, being the lone
senior on the team to make it to na-
tionals, it would be especial-ly
rewarding to move one step closer
to the Olympics. He has set

 

numerous records throughout his
four years at Pitt, and qualifying
for the Olympic trials would be
quite an ending to an illustrious
career. The Panthers are now‘the
top team in the East and have the

At r..-........

opportunity to gain even more
recognition nationwide with an im-
pressive showing‘this week.
“They’re a great bunch of guys,”
said Winkler. “We’ve been work-
ing hard all year. There’s no

Should the Panthers battle the
waves to victory, it will be on to the
Olympic trials in June for them, as
their quest to represent the United
States in Moscow continues.

Louisville Flies High After NCAA*Victory   

LOUISVILLE, KY.—Mayor
William Stansbury welcomed the
NCAA championship Louisville
Cardinal basketball team home
Tuesday by proclaiming this “the
year of the Cardinals” in Louisville.

Gov. John Y. Brown Jr. ﬂew the
team to the state capitol in
Frankfort to be honored in his~of-
fice.

A predawn welcome-home rally

planned at the University of
Louisville was called off because of
the tumult surronding the team bus
when it arrived about 2:30 a.m.

Girls did handsprings, boy shin-
nied up utility poles, fans whooped
and hollered, got drunk,‘ climbed
buildings, screamed and sang and
lit a bonfire as the bus rolled in.

City and university police decided
the crowd, including 50 or .60 fans
who climbed atop the bus, was too

Even the players, triumphant

‘ after their 59-54 victory over UCLA

in the championship game Monday
night, were taken aback.

“This is pandemonium,” said-

Derek Smitht, whose _two free

throws with 52 seconds left helped

nail down the victory a few hours
earlier. '

“There ain't no way I’m getting
off this bus,” said Poncho Wright.

“These people are crazy,” said
Rodney McCray. “They’re going
to break the windows.”

People banged on the side of the
bus while others climbed on top,
The roof began. to buckle and it ap-
peared for a while it might give way.

The streets were littered with
thousands of bottles and cans. The
fans had gone wild. '
