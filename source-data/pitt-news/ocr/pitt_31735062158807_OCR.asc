Wherein Co-ed
Fashions Are Given

The Twice- Over

By FRANCES FASHION.

Pitt undergraduate women

will as_ usual this winter com-

,bine with ﬂair the newest in

town wear with the smartest in
campus wear. 4
Because so many Pitt’ co-eds
travel to ‘school by vehicles patron-
ized by commuters from many
other walks in life, they keep up-

: to-the-inintue in town dlress. They

are cautious of freak fashions.
Their friends at other colleges may
wear only campus-togs. But Pitt
women do and will take advantage
of their opportunity to use the en-
tire fashion market.

Symbolic of Pitt women’s style '

is simplicity. -
Their clothes do not detract at

tention from their facial expres-

sions and lithe ﬁgures. Louisa

"Mulligan, that young creattor of
style who recently visited Pitts-

burgh, emphasized ﬁrst, good sim-
ple lines. Then, fabric and color.

This season ‘we will be slim as
saplings! Our shoulders will be
free from tricks.

Our skirts straight as columns
and any fur we wen“ will not be
bulky. Two featured furs of the

season will be protective enough

in small quantity; these are skunk
and opposum—-both hard wearing
and ﬁting our style.

Ah! Accessories

Accessories are bound to make
or break this year’s chic. eW hear

and read now about mass and
'bulk of jewelry.

We believe the smartest mod-

erns on asd off campus will love

the heavy old jewelry as much as
their great-grandmothers, but that
they will wear only a slall quan-
tity of it at a time. '

Hats are extreme. We are al-
ready investing in stove-pipes
with and without brims. The next
investment could well be a low
pillbox.

Some two or three of our ac-
cessories will probably match both
in color and in design: perhaps,
hats and goves of anteope.

Imagination has been used in
the designing of our gloves. Per-
haps our favorite pair will be non-
chalantly brief with square ﬁin-
gers; ifwe drive to.school, may-
be we will favor a two-faced pair
with palm of leather and suede
back. Probably, we will wear one
pair of saddle stitched gloves.

Today is perfect suit-weather.
Our favorite suit can be worn
brisk mornings and all day with or
without the jacket. Suits will not
be packed away until ‘spring by
wise co-eds, but will be worn
through the winter under your
swagger sport coat.

iwatch Taffeta

For informal dress, co-eds will
continue not to feel dressed-up.
Ve_lvet with and without lace is
special right now. Soon we proph-
esy taffeta will be taking its place
in the fashion spot-light. In our
whispering campaign of taffet,
we will use velvets to emphasize
waist-lines, shoulders, and hem
lines. '

We anr our mothers knit and
crochet our sweaters and, occa-
sionally, a dress.

We will be wise to match our
yarn to a stunning skirt and com-
plete the ensemble.

The hand embroidery on our pet
afternoon dress gives us more
credit for domesticity than we de-
serve. On our best formal we leave
out the secret that it is not our
skill with the needle for which we
are to be commended. But instead,
our skill at buying for ourselves in
the vast style market. We cannot
take credit for the formal’s gold
embroidery or gold kid appliques.

Bead,s too, ﬂabbergast us when
we attempt to analyze how these
could be: set into military designs
on our dresses. _

 The prints will represent a
‘ cross—section of contemporary
artists whose work is of such

merit as to deserve wide public
recognition, Professor Hovey says.
,Examples of conservative and so-
called modern art will be included
and even realistic and sur-real-
ist art. The prints Wil show a wide
range of subject matter rendered
in different techniques.

From Placement
Bureau Director

An increasing demand in the
business world for college women
is reported by Miss Frances Mc-
Laughlin, assistant dean of women
in charge of the University’s
placement Bureau.

During the past year 82 gradu-
ate women and 424 undergraduate
women were placed in jobs by the
bureau, an increase of 40 per cent
over placements by the bureau for
the previous year, and an increase
of 21 per cent over the 1935-36
ﬁgure.

Moreover, the minimum salary
offered graduates is 16 per cent
higher than a year ago, Miss Me-
Laughlin reports, and adds that
the average salary offered is 9 per
cent higher than the minimum.

Five types of positions which
were ﬁlled most often by Pitt wo-
men during the year, Miss Mc-
Laughlin says, were: secretary, ac-
countant, saleswoman, laboratory
assistant, and receptionist. The
ﬁve types of positions for which
there are the greatest number of
temporary jobs for under_-grad-
uates are: saleswoman, waitress,
office clerk, camp counsellor, and
‘typist. "  3 "

Bureau for Meiii.

lllore ‘jobs ffor'l)otl1 graduates
and under—graduates is the theme
of the statistics. _'

A total of 301 full—time jobs
were found for Pitt graduates in
the year ending’ June 30. Three
hundred and ﬁve placements were
made during the previous year.
Accounting for the drop was “a
slimmer supply of available men.”

Nevertheless, gains over other
years wereievident. In 1934-35
only 232 were placed, and in 1933-
34 only 86 found jobs through the
Bureau.

Of the men—-many of whom
are, of course, employed-whose
applications are on ﬁle in the
Bureau", 597 were jobless when
the books were closed this year
-—as compared to 739 without
jobs in 1936.

During the year the Bureau re-
ceived requests from employers
for 929 graduate applicants, and
2,336 men were referred.

BETTER CONDITIONS

The gross annual income of all
301 graduates placed during the
year totaled $452,740—represent-
ing a saving in employment agen-
cy fees to Pitt men of more than
$20,000

The report declared:

“Our inability to ﬁnd qualiﬁed
applicants for many positions--a
condition we did not face a few
years ago—certainly reflects im-
proved general business condi-
tions.” 3

The Bureau was unable to com-
ply with reauests;.;f0r .Iner.i from
124 employers. '

Student employment also show-
ed an encouraging trend.

Pitt men earned more than $50,-
000 in part-time jobs secured by
the Bureau during the year, an
average of $32 per student-job,
and an average of $123 per student
registered at the Bureau.

MORE JOBS

Secured during the year were
1,647 student jobs, as compared
with only 1,373 in the previous
year. ‘

In National Youth Administra-
tion employment, 525 undergrad-
uate men and 40 graduate stu-
dents were placed. Their earn-
ings totaled $5l,329—an average
of $86 per undergraduate and
$158 per graduate.

That’s The Word°

FRANCES MCLAUGHLIN

While no woman student ﬁnds
it possible to earn all her Univer-
sity expenses at the same time she
is carrying a full schedule of
classes, there were at least six Pitt
women who earned sufficient

money last year to pay for tuition,
lunch, and clothes.

Of the 764 -job Vacancies report-
ed to the bureau this year, 506 re-
sulted in placements. Al“’tota’l-=of
1258 jobs were not ﬁlled, Miss Mc-
Laughlin reports, because no qual-
iﬁed . persons available, ‘ qualiﬁed

persons did not want them, or be-

cause jobs'were not
suitable.

Chief limiting qualiﬁcations are
lack of experience and lack of
skills, p r i m a r i 1 y stenographic
skills, Miss McLaughlin says.

“Companies are becoming in-
creasingly selective in the women
they employ,” she states. “They
want to reduce turnover by select-
ing a ‘winner’ at the start. They
seek students of high academic
standing and experience in extra-
curricular activities, plus that in-
tangible qualiﬁcation, ‘personal-
ity.’ ‘

. .O_PPOR'l‘UNITY SOUGHT

“While the companies are selec-
tive, the women are also selec-_
tive,” she adds. “They would
rather wait for a position in the
ﬁeld in which they have been
trained than to take a better-than-
average salary
Moreover, Pitt women seem to
prefer a smaller job with opportu-
nity for advancement to a good-
paying position with no future.”

Miss McLaughlin reports an en-
couraging increase in calls ‘for
part-‘time; V‘ workers in offices “of
lawyers, brokers, insurance mana-
gers, doctors, and business men for
the current year. Althoughclasses
did not start until September 20,: a
number of students started to

BETTER FRESHMEN

Moreover, Registrar Quick said,
the trend toward more freshman
with upper two-ﬁfths high school
records continued on the increase
this year.

This year, 1,074 students are en-
rolled in the Graduate School; 230
in Medicine; 54 in Law; 39 in
Dentistry; 25 in Retail Training,
and 2,608 in late afternoon, even-
ing and Saturday classes.

Off—campus centers have a total
of 528, a 39 per cent gain over
last year.

Other gains for totals of all
classes are:

The College, ﬁve per cent; En-
gineering and Mines, 13 per cent;
Business Administration, nine per
cent; Education, -16 per cent;
Graduate, 14 per cent; Even-ing
Division, nine per cent.

PREDICTS 12,000

As cause for the gains, Mr.
Quick saw:

“Comparative industrial im-
provement has made it possible

emprasized, “that in Engineering
and Mines‘ and Business Admin-
istration, which suffered the larg-
est enrollment decreases during
depression years,’ the ‘most pro-
nounced improvement has taken
place.”

He predicted that 1937-38 resi-
dent student enrollment will ex-
ceed 12,000—close to the registra-
tion ﬁgure of 1928-29.

Troubles

Writing on “Low-Rental Hous-

i Francis D. Tyson, professor of eco-

nomics, says in the September’
number of the Pittsburgh Re-
view that the new Wagner-

Steagall Federal Housing Loam
Bill is “a step forward.”

Admitting that the measure be-
came law in a somewhat weak-
ened form, he believes that it willl
never—the-less be workable-

“It remains to be seen whether‘
the amendments, which at first.
seemed to emasculate the measure,
are really crippling,” he says.

“The law makes available to»
cities and states five hundred mil-
lion dollars for housing loans; andt.

these may under certain stipula-
tions run as high as 90 per cent oﬁ

Dr. Tyson concludes his article‘
by saying that the problem of low-
rent housing is a diﬁicult and
complicated one, demanding tech-
nical proﬁciency and superior
management.

“We may scarcely hope for rapid
progress,” he says. “What is more,
large issues of economic and so-
cial welfare are at stake. Besides’:
the immediate beneﬁts to the low-
er income group to be directly’
helped, larger possible advantages
to the community as a whole are
also involved, including the reem-
ployment of appreciable numbers
of the unemployed and the possi-
ble stimulation and stabilization
of business over a long period of
years.”

Realm Of Gold

NTIL I DISCOVERED the Alldred Room

I had always thought of college libraries
as places where one went to do “required
readings,” or to dig out facts for some exact-_
ing professor. “You’ll ﬁnd it in the library,”]
suggested long golden oak tables, hard golden!
oak chairs, and oak framed pictures of “Old
Faitliful Geyser” and the “Ruins of the Coli-
seum,” alternating with slightly chipped busts
of Caesar Augustus and Minerva the Goddess!
of \V'isdom. 5'

I think perhaps Mr. Peter Alldred must
have known just such libraries, because he (or
whoever established the Alldred Rooiii) made
it so different from the ones I had known. The
first time I wandered into the Alldred Library
I had the feeling that I had somehow entered
by mistake the livingrooni of some distin-
guished and successful author, who not only
knew and loved books, but who had the. means
to buy all he wanted of them. It seemed, too,
the sort of room where one was supposed not
only to read, but to enjoy reading. The chairs
were really comfortable; the rug and venetian
blinds and lamps were all chosen by soiiie-
body who knows what a good library should
look like.

And when the pleasant young lady in charge
came up and asked me if she could do any-
thing for me, I asked, “Is this room to be
used by everyone?”

“This is the browsing room," she said; “you
can read aiiytliiiig you want in here so long
as you read it for pleasure. There are'several
other library’ rooms where you can study.
This is the place to come when you want to get
acquainted with authors wliose iianies are not
on the required list. whose books you have al-
ways wanted to explore.”

So I €’Xl)lOl'(3(l. And I found biograpliies,
travel, novels, diaries, and all kinds of really
interesting stuff. I had just started to read,
“Loreiizo the Magniﬁcent,” and I was deep in
the exciting business of the fourteenth century,
when a. sudden glance at my watch told me
I must rush to class. I went up to the librari-I
an. reluctant to give up Lorenzo. ;

“I hate to leave this book liere,” I said.i
“You don’t have to leave it here,” the li-Z
brai-ian said. “If you sign up for it in the‘;
general library dowiistairs it will be sent (lO‘\Vll|

Listen To Reason
By
Dr. Richard Hope

To be victorious over oneself,  to attain the
greatest victory.

Two American Presidents whose personali-
ties have caught the popular iinagination conic
to mind. Theodore Roosevelt, by sheer per-l
sistency, conquered his delicate physical constitu-
tion; Franklin Delano Roosevelt, his paralysis. Vic-
tory in the battle for health was perhaps, in the
case of both, their victory. ,

Paderewski endured the most rigorous discipline
in order to achieve the technique which was es-
sential to his success as a concert pianist.

Augustine spent the years of his youth in dissipa-
tion. One of the fruits of his conversion was self-
control. Having attained mastery over himself, he
became a noted Father of the Church.

At the age of 40, Thomas Hobbes, the celebrated
seventeenth century English philosopher, studiedf
geometry. He was determined‘ to overcome this
lack in his knowledge.

Why waste our lives ﬁghting ghosts when there
are real and more powerful enemies closer at hand,
even within ourselves? Most of the troubles we
fear never come. They are ghosts, grim spectres
we conjure out of our own imagination. An idle

formidable foe for us to conquer.

Why spend a lifetime battling with our fellow-
men? We may put the same amount of energy to
more constructive uses. By controlling our hatred
we may change our supposed enemies into friends.

Men naturally like to tight at times. But philo-
sophers like James and Santayana have argued
that we may apply our fighting instincts to subju-
gating the forces of nature, or to the playful exhi-
bition of physical skill. Hence they have proposed
the conservation of natural resources, sports, and
similar enterprises as substitutes for war.

Health, artistic skill, good character, knowledge
are among the countless traits we may win by self-
mastery.

Consider: at what points may you gain your
greatest victory, the victory over yourself‘?

Pitterpatter...

It all started innocently enough. Until registra-
tion day, the ‘Big Apple’ was no more a part of
Pitt life than ‘The Bird.’ Then up stepped Wind-
ber’s gift to Delta Tau Delta, ‘Pete’ Gimber.

For it was ‘Pete’ who introduced the craze
the campus via the Bayard street fraternity lodge.
It is said that Gimber picked up the -dance this
summer in Baltimore and put it down again in the
Delta Tau parlor as he taught all the brothers how

to

to ‘peel’ it.

Who is the attractive senior woman in the
School of Education who pays for her educa-
tional measurements, statistics, and other courses
by acting as a model for art classes at Carnegie
Tech?

And, while we are at it, who is the English major
in the college who is, as freshman composition in-
structors would say, “one of the hottest ivory ‘Lick-
lers in the business?” ’Tis said he has played the
piano for Rudy Vallee, has been on radio programs,
and, in case you are interested, can be heard over
WJAS every Wednesdaynight at 8:15.

That is not a seismograph machine which
Rosemary Lutz dangles on :a chain. That hap-
pens to be an alarm-clock model of a watch.
And the time. just to be different, is Paris time!

Scooping the Panther——what coast—to-coast hitch-
hiker, a freshman in the college, has his transcon-
tinental thumb exposed in the coming issue of the

D. C. Schultz and William B. Me-Kenna, co—chair—

Seek Student Opinion

. Furniture And»

Appointments
Installed

Student opinion and suggestions,

las well as advice of experts in

interior decoration, will be- care-
fully considered as the furnishing
of the Cathedral of Learning
Commons Room goes forward to
completion. Introduction of fur-
niture and lighting ﬁxtures has
been begun in the Commons Room
and, according to Cathedral plan-
ning department officials, con-
structive criticisms as to their ﬁt-
ness will be welcomed.

Because of a desire to provide
furnishings for the Commons
Room that will be entirely in
keeping with the atmosphere of
the great room, the planning de-
partment announces that great
care is to be taken in its decora-
tion; and this means, it is said,
that the outﬁtting of the room will
proceed slowly so that a wide
range of opinion can be obtained
and helpful suggestions sought.

Ketterer Is Decorated

The chief consultant on the in-
terior decoration of the Commons
Room is the well known Gustav
Ketterer, who decorated the Na-
tional Archives building in Wash-
ington, the Supreme Court build-
ing, the Detroit Art Museum, and
many Atlantic City hotel interiors.
He is soon to make another visit
to Pittsburgh to judge the samples
of furniture and lights already on
trial. in the Commons Room.

The pieces of rough, unﬁnished
furniture now to be seen in the
Commons Room indicate the kind
of furniture that is contemplated.
It will be massive oak and will be
ﬁnished in old English design. The
present tables are several feet long
with tops two and three quarter
inches thick. They are as yet un-
varnislied and uncarved. There
willbe smaller tables also liar-
monizing with the surroundings,
and benches and chairs will be
provided thioughout the great hall
for approximately 300 students.

Lighting Arrangement

The same policy that is to be
followed in selecting the movable
furniture has been followed, and
is still being followed, with refer-
ence to lighting effects, the plan-
ing department reports. It is be-
lieved, however, that, after hav-
ing tried out a number of possible
ways of lighting the Commons
Room, the most effective method
has been determined.

Third Fashion

Contest Held

For the third successive year,

, Vogue magazine offers Senior wo-

Chancellor John G. owman to rep- 3 men Opportunities in the fashion

field. To the winner of Vogue’s
“Prix de Paris” contest goes a
year’s employment on the staff of
Vogue—-six months in New ork
and six months in Paris. To the
runner up goes six months in
Vogue’s New ork office.

Then, if the winners prove
themselves capable workers, they
may be employed permanently on
the staff of Vogue.

The contest is actually a cor-
respondence course in fashion and
it its application. Every contest-
ant will learn a lot about style, the
sponsors promise. What’s more,
each year of this contest, ‘Vogue
has aided in placing an average of
20 young women each season with
department stores, advertising
agencies, manufacturers and other
commercial establishments.

Entrants in the contest must be
members of the graduating class
of 1938 in a recognized college or
university.

Application must be made by
November 20. Entrance blanks
and contest rules may be obtained
at the Office of the Dean of Wo-
men.

For Commons Room

7

The difficulty noted in most
methods tried has been that they

’ tended to make the height of the

room seem less, an effect not to be
desired. It has been found, how-
ever, that by hanging lighting
ﬁxtures in the small vaults near
the piers these lesser.’ vaults are,
seemingly, pulled down and the
main vaults, by contrast, are made
toappear higher.

Other problems in lighting are
to keep too much light off the
ﬂoor, making the great hall too
much like a library or auditorium,
and to distribute light throughout
in such a way as to contribute to,
rather, than destroy, the inspiring
mood of the Commons Room.
These problems will be met with
carefully designed and placed wall
brackets and candelabra. These
ﬁttings are being designed by
Samuel Yellin, world famous
worker in wrought iron.

Stebbins Scores
Twice in Sluggish
Display

Starting slowly, after Marshall

—-Goldberg’s ‘ ‘first dash, then show- 6

ing increased lethargy until late
in the third period West Virginia
saw hopes of at least a “moral”
victory‘ over Pitt. Jock Suther-
land’s Panthers concluded Satur-
day’s game with West Virginia in
.a two-touchdown fourth quarter
for a 20-0. win.

Things looked very dark for the
Mountaineers in the ﬁrst quarter
when Goldberg took the kickoff
out of the air and trundled it back
to the West Virginia 28-yard line
from about a step behind the
Pitt goal. The Elkins ﬂash was
pinned against the sidelines, or

-else he might have kept on for a

touchdown.
The well-organized and always

«enthusiastic West Virginia cheer-

ing section was so shocked, that
not until its gold-garbed battlers
on the ﬁeld had stopped Pitt short
-of a score, did they wake up.-But
stop Pitt, at least the Pitt varsity,
was just what West Virginia was
able to do the ﬁrst period.

Following Biggie’s run the
Panthers were able to pick up a
first down on short jolts by Sta-
pulis, Goldberg, and Patrick. They
put the ball inside the ten-yard
line, and prepared for a touch-
down.

But the Mountaineers held, and
held well. The Pitt’s lost the ball
on the one, and West Virginia
promptly kicked out only to see
Goldberg run the ball back twen-
ty-ﬁve yards.

Patrick nulliﬁed this with a
fumble, and West Virginia again
kicked out of danger. The Pitt
power was on again, for one of its
short spurts, and two first downs
were chalked up. Then the Pitt
line took a rest and without inter-
ference the backs were unable to
gain, once more losing the ball in
‘the shadow of the West Virginia
goal.

By the start of the second pe-
riod the Mountaineers had backed
the Panthers up as far as the
"West Virginia 30, and Jock sent in
an entire new team except for
Patrick who remained at full.

Then Johnny Urban, who had
been left out of the halfback’s
scoring derby a week ago, put his
name among the breakaway run-
ners for 1937 by scampering 30
yards for Pitt’s ﬁrst score. He had
to push his interers out of the
way going through the line.

For the next twenty minutes
the game belonged to West Vir-
ginia. The Pitt blocking was far
below par. A succession of Panth-
er right halfbacks had trouble in
clearing the line of scrimmage.

On into the second half the
Mountaineers went, beginning to
carry the ﬁght to the Rose Bowl
champions.

Finally a series of plunges, fol-
lowed by a beautiful run by
Clark, West Virginia’s sophomore
left malfback, brought the West
Virginians within thirty yards of
the Pitt goal. Only clever defen-
sive work by Goldberg and Larry
Peace, who got through the Mor-
gantown interferers, kept Clark
from scoring.

This was the last gesture on the 3

part of the Glenn—coached ma-
chine. From that time on it grad-
ually wilted. Starting late in the
third period Pitt put on its one
sustained march of the day for its
ﬁrst score.

It was Dick Cassiano, and Steb-
bins for one ﬁrst down. Then it
was Stapulis and Stebbins and
‘Cassiano for another, with the
latter making his contribution
good for 15 yards.

Stebbins hit for a dozen yards
as things began to look better for
the right halfbacks from Pitt.
‘With the second team line work-
ing as Pitt lines should, Stapulis
went for six more, then Stebbins
broke away at right end, and went
21 yards for the second score of
the day.

West Virginia couldn’t keep the
ball, and Pitt scored almost im-
mediately following the
kickoff. A penalty left the Pitt at-
tack way down ﬁeld, but Dick
Cassiano cut inside his own left
end for two gains of eight and six
yards. A minute latter and he
went outside for 40. Stapulis
banged center for six more, then
Stebbins ran wide for eight more
and another touchdown.

Sleepy Glenn’s outﬁt was not
through, however. With the Pitt
third team in action, Kelly Moan
began to toss strikes and before
the Pitts could get collected the
West Virginians had a first down
on Pitt 21/; yard strip. V
» But here the Pitt reserves held.
The line tossed the Mountaineers

running attack back" twice, and:
the first pass fell incomplete. Then '

West Virginia went -wide for

what looked like a score, but'a.

goal-line fumble was recovered by

t

stime of 23:16, trailed by Pitt’s

Cassiano for a touchback, and
the folks went home.

Pitt outgained West. Virginia in
all departments of play, but pass-.
ing. The Panthers picked up 289
yards by rushing the ball to West
Virginia’s 50. Pitt tried only two
passes, completing ii short one for
a two‘-yard gain West Virginia
took the air seven times and hit

‘ Panthers Start Slowly,

the mark three times for a total
gain of 42 yards. First down were
ten to four.

-The game proved that West
Virginia is coming back, and that
Jock Sutherland will -have to do
something about the Pitt line on
the offense if the Dukes.,are to be
kept from repeating their 1936
triumph next Saturday.

Purdue

Much to the surprise of every-
one, including Coach Carl Olson,
Pitt’s cross-country team opened
its season with a win on Saturday
morning by beating Purdue over
the Schenley Park course by a 21-
34 score.

Pitt has one veteran back from
last year in George Zamborski.
The rest of the Pitt team is made

Band To Play
At Fordham

Athletic Council announced last
week that the Pitt Band will go
to the Fordham game in New York
Saturday, October 16. It was at
the Fordham game of last year,
that the band established its repu-
tation as the “best in the East.”

Approximately 130 members
will make the trip. According to
present tentative arrangements
the Band will leave from Pitts-
burgh early Friday morning, and
arrive at its New York hotel that
evening. After the game they will
board buses for Pittsburgh.

It is expected that the Band
will again win acclaim for the
University by its performance in
New York. Movements displayed
at the West Virginia game indi-
cate that the Band will be in good
training for the Polo Grounds. Al-
fred Baumann. E38, band manag-
er and captain is arranging for

some combined displays with the

Fordham Band. Band members
scheduled to make the trip will be

‘announced at rehearsal October

1 Jottings

When it‘ looked as though West
Virginia was going to hold Pitt
to a 7-0 score at Morgan-town on
Saturday, merchants of that town

began to edge out of the Stadiuni

to board up their windows. It

would have been a real moral Vic- A

tory for the Mountaineers, and

West Virginia student body can be‘

trusted to appreciate a victory.

 

Something was wrong with the
Pitt right halfbacks’ helpers on
Saturday. Not until late in the
third quarter was Curly Stebbins
able to shake himself loose. Fre-
quently the Mountaineer line was
halting Pitt’s tries at the enemy
right in the Panther backﬁeld.

 

Duquesne University will ﬁeld a
snappily dressed band against Pitt
this week. The Duke musicians
now number 70 pieces, and will be
attired in brand new uniforms.

 

Bandy Dick Cassiano did right
well by himself once he got into
action on Saturday.
at carrying the ball he picked up
72 yards.

Bluff Eleven

Stronger Than .
Last Year

Saturday is the Day, the Pitt
Stadiumthe Place, and the Du-

should want to know the center of
interest on the Pitt campus this
week.

One week short of a year ago
Duquesne went into the Pitt game
favored to lose. Pitt had just
beaten Ohio State and Duquesne
was only a warmup for Notre
Dame week later.

Then came rain, a fast charging
Duquesne line, and George Mat-
sik. The rain made an open run-
ning attack for both teams impos-
sible. The Duquesne line had the
Pitt interferers missing assign-
ments. Mr. Matsik broke into
the open in the second quarter and
ran some 70 yards for the ﬁrst——
and thanks again to the Duquesne
line and the Duquesne secondary,
the only score of the day.

Since that time the argument as
waged increasingly hot. Should
Duquesne have beaten Pitt?

Saturday should tell whether
the Dukes were merely fortunate
in getting Pitt on an off day or
whether Clipper Smith’s outﬁt
really is a first class power. Both
teams will be able to ﬁeld prac-
tically the same team, both suf-
fered equal losses by graduation.

After beating Pitt, Duquesne
stumbled against West Virginia
Wesleyan and then Detroit.
Smith’s outﬁt erased the sting of
that Wesleyan defeat by running
up 39 points of the Bobcats last
Friday night.

Saturday there will be no talk
of Pitt being off, for if any team
ever had an incentive to win, Pitt
has that.

But can Pitt do it, despite the
presence on the Panther roster of
so many _ﬁne football players?
Pitt has met more rugged oppo-
sition than Duquesne thus far, but
Pitt scouts who have watched the
Dukes play have been impressed
by the workmanlike attack of the
Nightriders.

Scouts who have watched Pitt
have not gained the same im-
pression. There has been no great
Pitt line play, as of other years.

Jock’s starting lines have not
clicked as Pitt starting lines
should.

When Sutherland digs into his
reserve he usually is abale to sit
back and see his backs go ﬂeeting
by for scores. But the Panthers
are slow starters, Sutherland made
three changes in his starting line
against West Virginia, and the
Pitt team still took a quarter to
get going. V

The Duquesne line isn’t going
to be as easy as Wesleyan»’s or

Dukes Present Threat

Vquesne game the Event, if anyone V

The Duquesne
offense is going to be a lot more
potent, with Brumbaugh, Matsik-,
McKeeta, Onder, Bechtloff, and
Karrs on hand.

The Dukes will go to the front
Saturday matching Pitt in weight,
and experience on the line. There
‘will ‘be’ little ‘to’ choose from in
the two backﬁelds. Pitt’s superior
running attack being matched
by the aerial attack always on tap
at Duquesne.

Sometime this week Sutherland
must whip his team into the men-
tal edge that it had before the
Notre Dame and Washington
games a year ago. It will need
that edge to combat evenly the
crusading spirit always possessed
by the Dukes when they step into
the Pitt Stadium.

After years of sitting down low,
the Pitt bandsmen will view Pitt
games from an improved position
this season. One of the nrst moves
of Jimmy Hagan, new athletic di-
rector, was to put the musicians
up in the stands where they could
view the game, instead of on the
ﬁeld-level grand-stand.

If you have seen about 126
girls around campus wearing
bleu and gold ribbons, and if
you have wondered whether or
not they were privileged fresh-
men, the answer is they are our
privileged transfer students.

At a dinner, given by the
transfer committee of WSGA
last week, the transfers from
Frick and from 43 other col-
leges were entertained, dined,
and presented with the distin-
guishing ribbons.

These blue and gold banners
are “how-do-you-doers”, meant
to remind Pitt women that
transfer girls are strangers just
as are the freshmen women.

After the dinner, an election
was held for the three transfer
members of the WSGA transfer
committee, and the following
girls were elected: Madge Cul-
len, Ed 38, Frick; Doris Nehrig.
Ed 39, Johnstown, and Jose-
phine Andrews, C 40, Bethany
College. They will cooperate
with the regular committee in
planning social aairs for pres-
ent and future transfers.

3* Robert. R. Gaw, alumni member of the

Board of Trustees of the University and general chairman for

the drive.

ness. Administration.

The special campaign to enlist

twomen graduates in the affiliated

Alumnae association will be di-
rected by Miss Rosemary McMa-
hon, a teacher in Knoxville Junior
High School.

TEAM CAPTAINS MEET

In preparation for the member
enlistment, which begins October
12'and continues for 15 days, the
membership chairmen and 150
team captains will meet in Hotel
Schenley tonight, tomorrow and
Wednesday evenings to select
prospective mebers from the lists
of the 16,000 men and women
graduates of the University who
live in Allegheny county.

Two other prominent Pitt alum-
ni Holgar Johnson alumni mem-
ber of the University’s Board of
Trustees and head of the tri—state
branch of the Penn Mutual Life
Insurance Company, and Earl
Crawford, ﬁrst vice-president of
the Alumni Association and dis-
trict sales manager of the Contin-
ental Rubber Company, will be
vice chairmen for the campaign.

“Our drive will be based on per-
sonal contacts,” Mr. Gaw has an-
nounced. “With 1,000 workers in
the ﬁeld we plan to call personally
on every one of the 16,000 poten-
tial Alumni Association members.”

First plans of campaign details
were outlined September 27 at a
dinner meeting in the Factulty
Club for president and member-
ship chairmen of constituent asso-
ciations. 0 '

 A tremendous amount of detail
i‘s involved in the preparations for
the intensive membership drive,
according to Don F. Saunders, act-
ing secretary of the General Alum-
ni Association. The ﬁrst task, Mr.
Saunders said, was the addressing
of 16,000 membership application
cards—one for every man and
woman graduate of the University
living in Allegheny County. From
these cards were prepared master
sheets listing alphabetically the
names of this army of potential
members.

The ﬁrst step in forming the or-
ganization of workers was the ap-
pointment of membership chair-
men for the nine constituent as-
sociations. The chairmen, in turn,
named team captains, and each
captain then selected four workers
for*his team. Every team will be
supplied with the names " of ﬁfty
member prospects.

 ’ Starts October 12
,,The campaign will open Tues-

NE of the University’s most
