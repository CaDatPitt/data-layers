Shooting on Forbes ends fatally

One killed, one injured
in fight outside WPU

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

A fight that started outside the Original Hot Dog Shop
early Saturday morning left one person dead and another
wounded.

Franklin Lockett, 20, of Homewood, was shot and killed
a block away from the “O,” where police said a verbal
fight between four to six people began around 4:30 a.m.

The fight then moved inside cars driving down Forbes
Avenue toward the Cathedral of Learning and, according
to police, a gunfight began at the corner of Forbes and
Bigleow.

Lockett was killed of a gunshot wound to the chest,
according to the Allegheny County Coroner’s office.
Another person was shot and injured in the gunfight and
taken to Presbyterian University Hospital, but his name
was not released.

Pitt Police Chief Rick Boyd said neither individual
involved in the shooting was a Pitt student and he didn’t
know what started the fight.

An investigation of the shooting is being conducted by
Pittsburgh City Police, and no one could be reached for
comment.

  Pulling cm all-nighter
withilie Piﬂ Police

I By Anthony Breznican
Senior Staff Writer

At eleven o’c1ock Thursday evening, the night crew
of Pitt’s Campus Police assembled in the Public
Safety office for roll call and briefing.

The meeting was delayed by a group of young boys
who were arrested earlier, but still had to go through
fingerprinting. There were six of them altogether.
None looked older than 13.

The officer in charge of the outgoing shift, Sergeant
Price, told me they had been arrested for breaking
into cars. ’

“They’re about this big,” Price said, holding his
hand about three feet from the ground. “But with their
mouths are going you’d think they’re about this big.”
He held his hand over his head, and rolled his eyes. 1

' After the kids were taken away, the assembled offi-
cers were called for roll, and broke up into their vari-
ous assignments. I waspaired with two different offi-
cers that evening, one on the North»Oal_<land.beat for

Mo keover in works  

  for review board    

By Cesca Antonelli
Staff Writer

By the end of March or early April, anyone who does
research on human subjects at Pitt, including at the Medical
Center, is going to be dealing with new regulations and dead-

’ lines to get their research approved.

The Institutional Review Board (IRB), which approves all
human subject research, is overhauling their department.
There will be new guidelines, many new staff members, new
forms and new information that groups doing human subject
research will need to know.

The IRB was established as a protection for research sub-
jects. In order to do research projects involving people, the
researcher has to submit a protocol form describing the pro-
ject to the IRB for approval. If a project is deemed unsafe or
possibly harmful to participants, it isn’t allowed to proceed.

Last year, the IRB processed more than 2,000 protocol,
according to Jeannie Barone, the operations manager.‘ The
IRB currently has four staff members. ' V '

When the changes are made, that number will grow to 64.
They. will establish four subcommittees, each with '16 mem-

bers from various disciplines. The subcommittees will each ‘_

Oakland for the remainder of the ride along.

Rich Hamilton was the first officer I was paired with that evening. He .

has been on the ll p.m. to 7 p.m. shift of the North Oakland beat for the
past 20 months. “It’s not bad some nights,” Hamilton said as we cruised
past the fraternity houses away from Sutherland Hall. “The cold tends to
keep them in,” he said. “Then again, the bars are always full. You just
never know.”

He flicked on the right alley lights and checked the back doors to Old
Engineering, Thaw, and SRCC buildings as we drove down University
Drive. -

Officer Hamilton has the hardened look of a man who’s seen a lot, his
eyes always searching as if daring the blackness beyond the headlights to
surprise him. The time he’s spent patrolling North Oakland has been pretty
good so far, he said.

“Mostly it’s been pretty quiet,” he said. “There’s a few parties and all
that get out of hand. Sometimes I park the car and go on foot to talk to
some of the kids. I tell them ‘these are the rules,’ and if they follow the
rules we’ll get along, and we won’t have any problems.”

Hamilton said that most of the problems caused are alcohol-related.

_ “Mostly we see kids drinking and getting drunk. Some of them get drunk

and fight amongst themselves. Other than that, most kids up here are

Hamilton said the worst thing he’s seen happen up there so far was in the
fall. “We found a guy from the projects who was pistol-whipped up on the
hill,” Hamilton said. “Someone snuck up behind him and beat him, and
robbed him, then just left him there.”

I I The night I rode with Officer Hamilton turned out to be one of the quiet

ones. We spent our time following the car assignment through North
Oakland and out to Pitt"s Chancellor’s house on Devonshire Street. “It’s
empty as of now,” Hamilton said, “but we still check it to make sure every-

thing’s okay. Usually it’s pretty dead out there.”

A little after 1:30 a.m. we got a call that a party was going on in one of
the suites in Bruce Hall. The Resident Director on duty, Kishma DeCastro,
was brought on the scene by Officer Kathy Gaus of the South Oakland car
assignment, my second partner for the evening.

“We have to get the R.D. in here. It’s the only way we can get into the a
room,” Hamilton explained as we rode to the sixth floor of Bruce Hall in
an elevator packed full of officers. “Otherwise, you have to get a search
warrant to enter the room.”

“Unless somebody invites you in,” Officer Gaus explained to me later.
“Sometimes, that even ‘happens! I like when there’s a bunch of people
smoking dope in the room, and they answer the door with a joint in their
hand. Makes our job easier, I guess.” .

Once the door was opened at the suite, the police confiscated the party
ball the residents had been joyfully consuming and dumped it down the
drain of the shower. The students were charged with violation of university
policy and were told they’d have to attend classes concerning the dangers
of underage drinking.

After that, I joined up with Officer Gaus to begin another patrol of South
Oakland.

Later, Gaus would explain to me that none of the campus police like
busting kids for underage drinking, but that sometimes it has to be done.
“We really aren’t out to ruin anybody’s good time,” She said.-“There isn’t
any quota system where we have to catch a certaininumber of underage
drinkers every night.” 

Gaus said that safety is the key issue when dealing with underage drink-
ing. “We just want people to be a little responsible,” Gaus said. “We just
want them to follow the rules.”

and Holland Halls Thursday evening.)

Barone said.

The combination of the
biomedical and psychosocial
categories will especially
affect those people doing
psychosocial research involv-
ing children. Rather than fil-
ing a traditional assent form,
those researchers will have to
switch to the consent form
used by the biomedical sec-
tion. Barone urged anyone
affected by the switch to call
the IRB to get directions
about how to fill out the new
form.

There may also be changes
to the procedure for reporting

The IRB keeps a log of these

Opinions

Safety smokescreen

Last Thursday, Pitt instituted its much—advertised Student
Walking Escort Service. Now if you are out after the shuttles or
VanCall stop running, you don’t have to brave the wilds of
Oakland alone, right?

WRONG!

The escort service will only operate until 2 a.m., which means
you’ll have to leave the bar before last call if you want someone to
walk you home. Since the escorts really aren’t there to allow you
to drink a little bit longer, think about another consequence of the
limited hours. This also means you will have to leave the library
before it closes at 2 a.m. if you don’t want to walk home by your-
self.

In theory, the escort service is a good idea, and the university
and the SGB should not be faulted for trying to make it happen.
However, in a more practical sense, the escort service is not worth
the time, effort and money put into creating it.

Aside from the limited hours of operation, the escort service has
a very limited range of movement. Escorts will only escort stu-
dents around main campus, which does not include anything in
North or South Oakland. If you do not live in a dorm, you don’t
get an escort home. If you want to go to a building on the hill
(like, say, Pennsylvania Hall) you have to go by yourself. If you
live in Sutherland or one of the Greek houses on the hill, you’re
stuck.

The escort service does not travel beyond the most well-lit areas
of campus. The only places you can get an escort are the places
you wouldn’t necessarily need one. Of course, things can (and do)
happen on Forbes and Fifth Avenue, so you may still want an
escort.

So what is the escort going to’ do if something does happen?
Escorts are not armed with anything other than a radio, and they
are not trained in self-defense. The only training escorts receive is
in situation avoidance. How much good is that going to do when
someone pulls a gun and shoots you? Is the escort going to jump
in front of a bullet? Probably not, and he or she shouldn’t even be
expected to. About all an escort could do is walk you to a hospital,
except that the hospitals are outside the allowed range of the ser-
vice.

Instead of concentrating so much time and money into what is
apparently a public relations scam to make this school sound safer,
the time and money should be used to actually make the campus
safer. ,VanCall and campus shuttle services should be extended to
24-hour services, so that students who live outside of main campus
can get home safely. If these services were extended, there would
be very little threat to anyone who used them, since the possibility
of being attacked is avoided. If you’re in a vehicle, you’re a lot
less likely to get jumped than if you are walking next to another
student. Every shuttle doesn’t need to run 24 hours a day, but there
should be safe transportation available to any student at any time
to North and South Oakland as well as on campus.

And the nominations go to...

Maybe Steve Forbes isn’t
this election’s pretender, like
Gary Hart, Pat Robertson
and Ross Perot have been in
years past. Maybe he’ll come
from nowhere to take the
Republican nomination and
win the Presidency. But
don’t bet on it.

If, however, these strange,
normally unelectable tycoons
pooled their money with
other million- and billion-
aires and started a third
party, they could certainly
beat the two major parties.
They could call themselves
the Eccentric Party and have
their convention in Newport
or Grosse Point. Like the
Republicans, they could have
a three-initial nickname: the
CRG, for Creepy Rich Guys.
And like the elephant and
donkey, they could have
their own animal mascot —
the goose. Why a goose?
After the Spruce Goose,
Howard Hughes’ mammoth,
expensive and non-function-
ing airplane. I can’t think of
a better metaphor for govern-
ment and, in Hughes, I can’t
think of a better creepy rich
guy of legend to represent
the party the way Lincoln
and Jefferson represent the
Republicans and Democrats.

Of course, there would be
a problem with the plan,
namely this: every. creepy
rich investor would want to
be President. Luckily, the
executive branch has some-
thing similar to a board —
the Cabinet. Forbes could
still be President if he invest-
ed the most money, and less-
er partners could fill Cabinet
slots. Hereare my choices
for these slots. Confirmation
may be tough for some of
them, but the party. ought to
be able to buy the necessary
votes.

The Secretary of State.

would have to be Perot, last
election’s creepy rich guy.
He could grace the planet
with the kind of diplomacy

on
enry

that has made him friends
the world over, from Mexico
to Iran.

But as important as foreign
relations are, the federal
deficit is even more impor-
tant. That’s why I’m nomi-

nating CRG Bill Gates for ‘

Treasury. Not to be Secretary
of the Treasury, but to be the
Treasury. He could trade his
assets for the government’s,
and the deficit would be
gone overnight. The only
drawback to this plan would

be a new federal law mandat-

ing that all adults buy
Windows95, whether they
own a computer or not.‘

Fora while, the Secretary
of Defense slot looked like a
tough one to fill. After all,
the rich are not known for
their military service, and
several are known to have
charged the Pentagon $2,000
for things like toilet seats.
Then, from nowhere, came
Pennsylvania’s» own John E.
duPont to fill the void. Who
else could lend Army tanks,»
howitzers and machine guns
if they_ever ran short? Plus,
he could save the department
millions by hiring shadows
on the wall-for such jobs as
Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Next, my choice for
Attorney General. Who else
but O.J. Simpson is qualified
to run the world’s largest
crime lab, especially "its
blood-handling facilities?
Besides, with every U.S.
Marshall and all FBI, DEA
andd3”‘ATF agents under his
command, cooperating with
every border and national
park police officer, the “real
killers” will probably be
found the day after the inau-
guration.

My Commerce Secretary
has only a civil case pend-
ing, but then again, so does
Simpson. And he lives only
forty miles from the White

House, in Baltimore. Art
Modell knows more than
anyone about interstate com-
merce, plus he’s rich and
creepy. He’s perfect.
The.Secretary of Education
must be a real “hands-on”
guy who loves kids so much,
he’d give up his marriage for
them. There’s only one CRG
who fits that description, and

he hardly needs an introduc-

tion. In case he does, howev-
er, I present your new

’Secretary' of Education:

Michael Jackson. And since

he’ll be in the schools and '
out of the studio for at least a

four. years, the country will
be doubly blessed.
For balance, the Eccentrics

‘may want to pick someone

who is clearly liberal in
order to get the broad sup-
portneeded to win an elec-
tion. The problem is that
while many creepy rich guys
will admit to alcoholism,

greed, insanity, wife-beating’

and egoism, few will admit
to being a liberal. That’s why
the new-party can’t let Ted
Kennedy get away from
them. Kennedy would be a
great Transportation
Secretary. The harder he
worked, the less highway
carnage there would be. and

not just because he’d be in‘ '

the office instead of behind
the wheel. He’d make sure

the bridges were safe, for

instance. And he would man-
date automotive safety fea-
tures other secretaries hadn’t
dreamed of, like pontoons.

With billions of dollars, -

people of all political
philosophies, and more ego
than brains (an absolute must
in the executive branch), the
Eccentrics, in my opinion,
could not lose the elect_ion.
At least, they couldn’t until
the major parties came up
with candidates better than

‘ Clinton and Dole.

Sports
Whining
athletes are
a growing

 

Columnist
Mike
Kovak

ost people have heard
the old proverb
“Sportswriters are the

lowest scum on the face of the
earth.”

For decades, sportswriters have
been reviled by the public and,
more importantly, athletes.

Why should athletes, especially
professional ones, despise the
media so? The fact is that many
of these athletes that curse the
warriors of word are the lowest
scum on the face of the earth.

Over the 1980s, many, not all,
athletes have quickly become
money-hungry, endorsement-
seeking punks with the loyalty of
Princess Diana.

Former Pittsburgh Steeler
offensive lineman Leon Searcy is
an example.

Searcy left a team that went to
the Super Bowl for the
Jacksonville Jaguars, a team that
won three games last season.
Searcy was a key ingredient and a
beloved member of the organiza-
tion. He was popular with team-
mates and fans.

Obviously, that doesn’t mean
anything to Leon. Even though
Searcy has never played a down
in the Pro Bowl, he received the
highest contract ever for an offen-
sive lineman and drove a knife
through the backs of Western
Pennsylvania and the growing
legion of devoted Steelers fans
everywhere.

Searcy signed a ﬁve-year con-
tract worth $17 million to go to a
team where it will be a miracle to
make the playoffs in those five
years.

- The Steelers were willing to
offer Searcy a five—year, $13.5
million to stay on a Super Bowl
team, but I guess that extra $3.5
million was just too much to pass
up. (I bet he could have pawned
next year’s Super Bowl ring for
$3.5 million.)

Searcy’s loyalty is garbage, but
it was justified by going to a
garbage team where, hopefully,
he will deteriorate into a garbage
player.

It could be argued that the
NBA is overﬂowing with little

In the opening six minutes of the Pitt Panthers’ Saturday matinee
against Villanova, the Panthers exploded to a commanding 15-2
lead.

It took 36 minutes for Villanova to recover, but led by Kerry
Kittles’s 25 points, the Wildcats crawled from the.Field House with
a 67-64 victory. They are the third top-ﬁve squad to make such an
escape this season.

“Seems like the same thing over and over,” said Pitt forward Chad
Varga, who scored 18 points and grabbed seven rebounds in the loss.
“It’s frustrating.”

Early in the contest, it was Varga who frustrated the Wildcats,
scoring nine points before Villanova could manage its first field
goal. An early dunk, a baseline jumpshot and a three-point shot from
the top of the key showed off Varga’s versatility. '

What Villanova Coach Steve Lappas called “good perimeter
skills” from Varga, mixed with outside shooting from Vonteego
Cummings and Kevin Willard, gave Pitt a 12-1 lead at the first

-media break. Jason Lawson finally managed a Wildcat field goal at

the 13:07 mark, dunking a Kittles miss to cut Pitt’s lead to 11.

“I thought that we started to do a good job on [Varga] with about
seven minutes to go in the first half,” said Lappas, whose squad
began clawing back into contention after containing the Pitt forward.

A man-to-man defense that stopped the Wildcats early began to
show some weaknesses, especially when Kittles moved to the point
and drew coverage from Willard.

Mismatches led to fouls, and Villanova managed to stay in the
ballgame by sinking 12 of 16 from the stripe in the ﬁrst half. The
last six points of the half were ‘Nova free throws, with the final two
coming from Kittles with four seconds left on the clock. It added up
to a 35-34 Pitt lead at the break. Villanova shot 78 percent from the

' line for the game.

The Panthers’ overall offensive play overshadowed a 9 of 13 per-
formance at the stripe in the first half. In the second, Pitt would not
be so fortunate. ,

Neither team could put together a run early in the second, as the
teams traded baskets and the lead for the first twelve minutes. Pitt’s
first chance to pull away came at the 7:51 mark, when a Lappas
technical put J erry McCullough on the line‘ with the Panthers ahead
53-49.

House. The loss dropped the
Lady Panthers’ record to 4-20
and 3-12 in Big East play, putting
them in jeopardy to break the
school record for losses of 21.
“We might have been over-
matched in this game, but we’re
not consistent in the areas we
need to be,” Bruce said. I
In an effort to “shake things
up,” Bruce started freshmen
Kellie Nelson and Gina
Montesano in the backcourt and
Alecia Balich up front. In turn,
he benched point guard JoJo

. Guzman, shooter Stephanie

Petho and forward Melissa
Thompson.

“I don’t know if it was a
benching, it was more like shak-
ing things up,” Bruce said. “They
had better practices.”

The end result, however, was
the same. Notre Dame jumped
out to a 11-0 lead before
Montesano finally hit two free
throws at the 12:49 mark to crack
the scoring column.

“They were nervous,” Bruce
said of the freshmen. “Alecia
missed a lot of shots she usually
makes, so that’s a good indica-
tion she was nervous.”

It wasn’t just the freshmen that
were nervous. Pitt shot a collec-
tive 21 percent in the first half as
Notre Dame went into intermis-
sion leadirig 37-18.

Five Notre Dame players
scored in double figures, with
forward Beth Morgan leading the
way with 18 points.

“Notre Dame had it all,” Bruce
said. “They had the inside work-
ing and the outside. Plus they
play good defense.”

The Irish’s good defense was
apparent. Besides shooting 21
percent in the ﬁrst half, the Lady
Panthers were held without a
three-point field goal in the ﬁrst
stanza and shot a skimpy 33 per-
cent for the game. They also
turned the ball over 32 times and
only had nine assists, opposed to
Notre Darne’s 24.

Conversely, the Irish shot at a
55 percent clip from three-point
land and 49 percent _from the
ﬁeld.

Montesano, who Bruce said
was one of the few bright spots
all year, led Pitt in points,
rebounds, assists, minutes, steals,
shots and turnovers. She tallied
15 points, six boards, three
assists, two steals and seven

turnovers in 30 minutes of-

action.

_ Center Latia Howard notched

14 points and Petho scored nine.
“Just because we started fresh-

men doesn’t mean we’re chuck-

ing in the season,” Bruce said.

I’iIt wrestling drops to PSU and

By Kevin Lilley
Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling squad dropped
two dual meets in two days last
weekend, falling to West Virginia
19-13 on Friday and dropping a 16-
15 decision to Penn State on
Saturday.

  
   

The losses dropped Pitt’s meet
record to 13-7-1, and may cost the
team their national ranking. The
grapplers were ranked 21st by the
Amateur Wrestling News before this
weekend’s bouts.

Nationally-ranked J.J. Fasnacht
and Mark Bodo were Pitt’s only
wrestlers to register two wins for

Pitt freshman Joel Giroski, wrestling at the 177-pound weight class, lost
both matches over the ‘weekend to Penn State and West Virginia.

the weekend. Both were ranked fifth
before their matches. Fasnacht
improved his overall record to 28-3,
while Bodo’s two decisions pushed
his mark to 25-3.

Fasnacht’s opponent at 142
pounds from West Virginia was
Dorian Hager, ranked 10th national-
ly before the meet. Fasnacht earned
a 3-2 decision in the match, pushing
Pitt to a 10-3 lead in the contest.
The Mountaineers fired back, win-
ning the next four weight classes
before Bodo’s victory over O’Dell
Tucker brought the Panthers back to
within three at 16-13.

Heavyweight Pat Wiltanger, ninth-
ranked before this weekend, had a
chance to at least tie the meet for
the Panthers, but was upset by
unranked Jim Howard. Howard’s 3-
1 decision dropped Wiltanger’s
record to 23-3 on the year, and gave
the unranked Mountaineers their
seventh team win of the season.

“He’s beaten Howard several
times before,” said Pitt 167-pounder
Brian Matusic, who dropped a 4-2
decision in the meet. “They’ve
always been close.”

Wiltanger recovered with a 9-3
decision over Penn State’s Matt
Gaul in the next day's meet, but it
was not enough to stop the Nittany
Lion victory. The sixth-ranked
Nittany Lions opened up a 16-12
lead before the heavyweight bout,
with four team points coming from
top-ranked 150-pounder Russ

WVU over weekend

Hughes’s majority decision over
Pitt’s Brett Gould. While the squads
split the 10 matches evenly, the one
extra point given for the majority
decision gave the match to Penn
State.

Mike Ziska earned Pitt’s only
majority decision of the weekend,
winning his match over WVU’s
Jason Taylor by a 14-5 margin. John
Richey was Pitt’s only other winner
on Friday, scoring a 9-7 victory at
134 pounds. The loss against West
Virginia was Pitt’s first in the
Eastern Wrestling League.

Matusic and Chris Stevens each
recorded victories against Penn
State on Saturday. Matusic upped
his record to 30-7 with a 5-2 deci-
sion, and Stevens’s 3-1 victory at
118 pounds pushes his mark to 7-16
on the season. _

Matusic downplayed the back-to-
back away matches, saying that “it

was tough, but I don’t think it ‘

affected us a lot.” He also stated
that Head Coach Rande Stottlemyer
used the same wrestlers in both
meets to “prepare us for the national
tournament.”

Pitt’s next meet is this Friday,
Feb. 23 at home versus Lock Haven.
It will be the team’s final home
meet of the year, and its last dual
meet before the EWL champi-
onships, which begin on Mar. 8.
Lock Haven is currently ranked
eighth in the nation, and is "unde-
feated in the EWL.

score at 56-52 when Wildcat John Celestand
fouled Willard hard, sending him out of the game.

Garrick Thomas came off the bench to shoot the
bonus shots for Willard. Perfect up to that point in
Big East foul shooting, Thomas’s shot clanked off
the rim.

“I felt very confident putting him in in that situ-
ation,” said Coach Willard.

The miss gave Villanova momentum, and a

Kittles 3-pointer gave the ‘Cats a 59-56 lead with

four minutes to play.

“You should shoot 80 percent [from the line] at
home,” said Varga, whose team shot 69 percent
from the stripe. “If we do that, we win the game.”

Varga showed off his skill at the stripe with 1:20
left in the game, sinking two in a row to pull Pitt
to within two at 66-64. A Pitt defensive stand
forced a travelling violation on Alvin Williams at
the 46-second mark, but a McCullough miss on
the next possession sent some fans toward the

exits.

Pitt’s _last gasp came after a missed Williams
free throw with 10 seconds left. A quick time—out
gave Coach Willard time to call the final play, but
an offensive breakdown forced an ill—advised shot
by Andre Alridge that fell short.

“Andre got a bit too close,” said Vlfrllard, who
also stated that the last play was “the story of our
offense in close games this year.”

Varga called the final play “just another exam-
ple of not executing,” also saying that “with six
seconds, people just got rushing.”

Varga’s 18 led all Pitt scorers, with McCullough
also breaking double digits at 14. Cummings
scored four points to go along with his team-lead-
ing six assists.

Despite his last-minute troubles, Williams man-
aged 19 points for the VV1ldcats. Lawson ﬁnished
with 16 and, combined with Williams and Kittles,
accounted for all but seven points of the ‘Nova
offense.
