Report Shows NO LOSS, NO Proﬁt;
Paul Specht’s Orchestra Pleases

Season’s First Formal Dance
§ Proves Decided Social
Success

 

By Charles B. Holstein

The Sophomore Hop Friday night
at the Schenley hotel broke even.

According to an unofficial and in-
complete ﬁnancial report of the affair,
obtained by the Pitt News late yes-
Iterday afternoon, the receipts and ex-
penditures of the dance balance to
the cent.

There are still a number of tickets
unaccounted for, and a few incidental
expenses which have not been de-

termined, but for all practical pur-
poses neither a gain nor a loss can be,
reported. ~ 1

Meanwhile, the better part of 450!
students at the University are still
talking of the Hop on Friday and of
the decided social success it was.
Paul Specht’s NBC and CBS orchestra}
added a few hundred admirers from
Pitt to the thousands who have heard
his band at the Inaugural Balls in
Washington, on stage and screen, on
innumerable broadcasts, and more
recently at the Casino at the Century
of Progress. An ideal repertoire fea-
turing just enough soft classical mu-
sic, fast snappy jazz, and vocal inter-
ludes proved a ﬁtting supplement to
the beautiful gowns and digniﬁed tux-
edos at the formal.

The program, though far from be-
ing called favors, were novel and
highly acceptable. The Cover, made
of tin metal on a blue -background,
featured the cutout of a sailing Ship,
and this portion of the card, when de-
tached, can be made to serve as a
book-mark.

The grand march was delayed by a.
number of factors, among which was
the broadcasting of Specht’s music
over Station WWSW for a half hour
but it eventually took place with
Arthur Stroyd, C36, and Anne Grif-
ﬁth, Ed 34, leading the procession.
Many students, not fortunate enough
t.o attend the dance, -took advantage
of the opportunity of listening in on
the broadcast and they too have been
praising on the campus the quality
of the dance music.

There was a bit of unusual excite-
ment when Specht was served with a
summons instigated by a singer for-
merly connected with his Orchestra.
However, it was not Miss Marie Du-
bre, the singer who gave the vocal re-
frains for many numbers during the
dance, who was the woman in the Case
as has been erroneously reported else-
where.

One of the outstanding features of
Specht’s fourteen-piece band was- a
harpist whose vibrant instrument add-
ed a great deal of classical harmony
to the musical offerings.

All in all, as the ﬁrst formal dance

 

precedents. A good band, Cleve!‘ pro-
grams, a delightful crowd, and, to get
trite, “a good time by all,” supple-
mented by the fact that no ﬁnancial
loss was suffered, added up to make
the ’36 affair a ﬁtting lead-off for the
year’s social season.

Grotto Ballroom IS
Frosh Dance
Site!

In anticipation of a large «turnout,
the committee of the Freshman Dance
has contracted for the immense Grot-
to Ballroom, perhaps the largest
and one of the most beautiful in the
city, for the annual ﬁrst-year affair
on November 17,

NO orchestra has deﬁnitely been
selected, according to Edwin Beach-
ler, chairman of the affair, but a num-
ber of outstanding local units are
under consideration. It will, in any
case, be a band which has played at
previous University affairs and which
has been popularly
stated.

The dance is to be informal, Tick-
ets will be on sale the latter part of
this week and next week at two dol-
lars per couple. At that time, the
orchestra will deﬁnitely be chosen.

Ruth DeHaven and Louis Shapiro

have been added to the commttee
bringing its membership to 25. A
number of the internal committee ap-
Dointments have also been affected.
Morris Rosenbloom has ‘been made
business manager of the affair; Ray

Scliieb will be in charge of publcity;

Edwin Drainard and Doris Evans have
been placed in charge of programs;

Ethan Colton  Discuss Leading
Russian Questions At Meeting
3

“IS Soviet Russih Heading for Peace
or War?” will be the topic for tomor-
row’s Inquiry club talk. Ethan Col-
ton, authority on; Soviet Russia and
author of “The XYZ of Communism,”
will be the speaker. The meeting will
take place in 107 Ajlumni Hall at 12:30
o'clock.

Mr. ColtOn’s talk will be centered
on the conflicting questions, is Soviet
Russia working for world peace? At
Geneva, Litvinov more than once has
asked the nations to disarm complete-
ly. Is the Soviet Union preparing for
war? If not, why are the children be-
ing trained to use rifles and gas
masks? Such questions and any that
students may ask concerning Russia,
Mr. Colton will answer as best he
can.

Colton has been in and out of
Russia since 1918, He ﬁrst saw Russia
in revolution with the power passing
to the Soviets. As
American welfare service in the
Russian army, he was in contact with
Russia from the German front to the
Paciﬁc, and within the Arctic circle
to the Persian border.

His jobs have thrown Colton into
contact with prominent Russians-
red, white and a3jQlitical—-Lenin, the
Patriarch Tikhon, Kropotkin, the T01-
stoys, Pavlov and the now outcast
Trotsky. Mr. Colton has been in con-
stant touch with the affairs of Soviet
Russia ever since, with the Soviet
press and documents, and other ofﬁ—
cial sources of information. On his

‘Students Urged

To Support Vital
-State Bond Issue

Failure Of Measure Means
Loss of $396,000 To
University

700,000VotersContacted

By Bernard Fleming

Today the verdict of Yes or No
on Amendment 8 rests at the polls
with the voters of the state.

Every organization that state aided
hospitals, welfare organizations and
educational institutions can muster,
which includes the General Alumni
association of the University, will
urge a Yes vote on Amendment 8 to
the voters today,

Pitt faces a loss of $396,000 if
Amendment 8 fails, for all appropria-
tions to state aided educational in-
stitutions will be cut one-third.

Student co-operation is asked
for in the following ways: (1) if
of age, vote; (2) Contacting as
many voters today and asking
them to vote Yes on Amendment

8; (3) by distributing literature

on why Amendment 8 must pass

today at the polls. This literature
may be obtained at the General

Alumni office on the thirteenth

floor of the Cathedral,

Amendment 8 reads: “Shall a new
section be added to Article IX of the
Constitution, authorizing the Gov-
ernor, Auditor General and State
Treasurer to borrow not more than
twenty-ﬁve million dollars to defray
the expenses of the State govern-
ment during the current biennium?”

The most Serious aspect of the bond
issue is that the amendment is the
basis Of the state’S unemployment re-
lief program. Failure will ruin this
whole program and create a social
menace to the state in the form of a.
half starved mob of some 3,000,000
unemployed and their families. The
appropriation for this work is $20,-
000,000, an amount that will be im-
possible to collect by taxation in
time to prevent widespread suffer-
ing.

State aided hospitals and institu-
tions will be crippled in giving free
Service to the poor without the $2,-
600,000 appropriation provided by
Amendment 8. Some will have to
give this free service up altogether
and other hospitals will close up en-
tirely.

Failure of Amendment 8 will give
the state not only a problem of un-
employment relief but the vital task
of giving medical care to its im-
poverishcd citizens. SO far no feas-
ible plan for handling these problems
have been Submitted to the state,
with the exception of immediate and
heavy taxes.

morning, ‘J. W. Hallock, the speaker,

Say It In Russian!

NOT UNLIKE THE GREEKS BEARING gifts and ex-

pecting Nausicaa’s wine, comes Maxim Litvinoﬁ,
Russia’s commissar on foreign affairs, baiting the Amer-
ican State Department with a billion-dollar order for
machinery and raw material in return for which the
USSR would like nothing better than unlimited credits
and Soviet recognition. Diplomatic overtures by both
countries have paved the way for Comrade Litvinoff’s
arrival today and the stocky, outspoken former revolu-
tionary editor will be greeted by favorable American
public opinion, ably created by well-managed newspaper,
radio, and news-reel accounts.

It does not require exceptional political foresight to
observe that the pending negotiations between the Unit-
ed States and USSR will result in far-reaching commer-
cial agreements by which Russia will be able to obtain
much-needed equipment and the United States will be
able to dispose of a surplus production which weights
down the domestic market. And it is not too early to
observe that the commercial relations between the Unit-
ed States and the Soviet Union for the next decade, at
least, will take on a. strange, but nevertheless real
Damon and Pythias complexion. It's a strange photo-
graph this, the Soviet Bear and the American Eagle!

Colleges and universities throughout the nation by the
next fall registration, at the most, should inaugurate de-
partments of Russian language and literature. The grow-
ing importance of Russia in the ﬁeld of industry and
commerce, and its future relations with the United
States, will create a demand for the business expert who
Our own
University authorities who will consider next fall's cur-
riculum might consider the addition.

The Investigators Report
HE STARTLING DISCLOSURES REVEALED by the
special investigations committee of student relations
concerning John Marshall club and Druids, although im-
portant in their speciﬁc applications to each group, sat-
isfy the student body on the campus with the work of a
group which has received its jurisdiction from duly
elected representatives of the students. The report is
an indication that the students who were elected last
spring to govern the student body on the campus are at
last showing some signs of administrative ability.
Druids, a campus honorary fraternity which VOLUN-
TARILY gave itself open to investigation, should proﬁt
greatly from the results given by the committee. The
weaknesses and faults which the report reveals were
the tender spots of the Druid organization as it has
functioned in the past few years, and need not necessa-
rily be taken so to implicate this year’s group. Activity
and reform on the part of this year’s organization with
an eye on the investigators’ ﬁndings will work for the
best interests of Druids as a campus honorary fraternity.
Two issues ago, the Pitt News commended Druids on
its proposed plan. Today we commend both Druids and
student relations committee’s investigating group for
their interest in the welfare of student activities. Cam-
pus organizations which are to face the investigators in
the near future would do well to remember that the com-
mittee is not a. group organized to bring an end to cer-
tain clubs and activities, but one which is working for
the betterment of student organizations and student ac-
tivities on the campus.

Between

You, Me
And The

Lamp Post
By Wilbur Clark

OWARD STOOPED OVER and

put the alarm clock on the floor

by the side of the tub, took the towel
off his arm and hung it on the rack,
then stepped out of his bathrobe into
the hot water of his evening bath.
Shadows of the ripples raced across
the bottom of the tub to the sides
and then bounced -back to the center
and so out to the sides again, as he
settled himself on his back, his legs
drawn up fakir-fashion so that he
might be completely immersed, and
wished, as he had many times be-
fore, that the peaceful joy of that
minute could last forever_ It was less
and less often of late that he had oc-
casion to wish a moment to last for-
ever. Now, there were but two such
times: one when he was in his bath;

_ the other when his pipe burned just

right and the taste of tobacco was
sweet in his mouth.
E BENT HIS HEAD so that his
chin touched his chest and the
water came just below his lower lip.
He blew and watched the reﬂections
the little waves made.

But when he was Yhung, that was
different. It seemed, as he lay there
in the tub with slow shadows, the re-
ﬂections of slightly disturbed water as
he breathed deeply, the only indica-
tion of motion, that his youth had
been full of moments that he would
like to have last forever. Midnight
skiing trips to the summit of Corry’»s
Round Top, for instance, when the
quiet of the snow made you sure that
there must be a God. Or the Satur-
day afternoons at -Cloe Dam With the
creek chasing down, splashing over
rocks and fallen logs, under a. screen
of rhododendrons, ﬁlling the valley
with the silence of rushing water.
Those moments were all worthy of an
eternity, or so it seemed to him then,
in the tub.

 

LREADY I’M GETTING old, he
thought, even though I don't’
have a beard to ﬂoat over my chest.
When you start living in the past,
remembering the joys of youth, then,
old boy, you are getting old. He won-
dered how long it would be before
the bath ceased to give him pleasure.
His glance fell on a rust-spotted
razor blade that stuck out over the
edge of a glass shelf in the corner.
Was it the Romans, he wondered,
who discovered that one can -bleed ~10
death quite comfortably in the bath‘?
He considered that. It probably would
be painless, but wouldn’t it make a
mess! The -blood blending with the
water, probably a pink at ﬁrst. H1911
gradually getting darker and darker.
Yes, decidedly a devil of a mess to
clean out of the tub afterwards-

Then the alarm went oﬁ. He came
to life, dripping over the edge Of tile
-"tub and turned it off. the Water drlh‘
ping off his arm onto the tile. Eleven
o’clock and time to hit the hay-

Oil, Gas Seminars Hear
Steel Authority Speak

A. E. ‘Crockett, manager of the in-
struction bureau of the Jones and
Laughlin Steel corporation, spoke to
the oil and gas seminar Thursday on
“The Use of Steel in the Oil Indus-
try.”

“Today," said Mr. ‘Crockett, “there
is a demand for greater tensile
strength in casing for wells drilled
to great depths. As a result, seam-
less tubing has been devedoped to
supplant the old hapwelded casing.”
While wells here are drilled to a
depth of about 11,000 feet, demands
from California call for the develop-
ment of easing suitable for drilling
15,000 feet.

Painting At Internationai

Shows Defeated Panther

Have you noticed that in the International Art Exhibit there is
a picture by Daniel Vasquez Diaz called “The Peasant of Palos,”
,;wl.=ich might seem symbolic to Pitt football rooters? No? Then next
time you visit the International, notice particularly this portrait of
2: peasant who holds. a startled panther in his tight clasp. Reginald
H. Johnson, assistant professor of modern languages, has noticed an

3. subject of much interest to Pitt
students.
In this picture the peasant in his

rustic suit holding an axe resembles
some character of our folklore. Yes.
Paul Bunyan, the great legendary
ﬁgure, the powerful lumberjack of
Minnesota who t-ore trees ‘bodily out
of the ground and who straightened
roads by stretching them between
his hands! The powerful brute
(alias Paul
with his brawny arms presses the
panther powerless against his breast,
while the panther, tawny and strong,
claws helplessly against the stronger
being. The expression in the ani-
mal's eyes is especially in keeping

startled, wild, helpless, cun-
ning, struggling, as certainly the Pitt
panther was when caught in the
meshes of Minnesota’s plays.

To make the impression that this
picture typiﬁes the Pitt-Minnesota
game more vivid, the artist (acci-
dentally of course) has painted the
cut in the tree made by the lumber‘
man's axe the color of football pig-
skin and the shape of a football. A
quick glance might fool one into be-
lieving that it is a football.

‘So— maybe Fate revealed Pitt's
destiny to Diaz and he, in turn, pre-
sented the theory to Pittsburgh in a
clever way, or—maybe, Mr. Johnson
is wrong.

topic was “The Discovery and Prop-
erties of the Positron.”

Tracing the discovery of the posi-
tron by Dr. Carl D. Anderson, profes-
sor of physics at California Institute
of Technology, less than a decade
ago, Dr. Nathanson went ahead to
Doint out the properties that have
been uncovered about this interesting
new discovery.

All electrical charges, he pointed
Out. are either positive or negative,
the negative ones being called elec-
trons and the positive being called
protons and positrons, depending on
their respective masses. A positron
is about the same mass as an elec-
tron, but a protron has a mass eight-
een hundred times as great as an
electron.

All the information that science
has about these positrons has been
found by experiments with “cloud-
chamber photographs,” Dr. Nathan-
son stated. However, it is believed
that the positron is the factor that
controls annihilation of cells.

About forty-ﬁve graduate students
and other interested persons attend-
ed this colloquium. A similar meet-
ing is held every Friday in Thaw
hall. Any person interested or ac-
quainted with these advanced ideas
in physics are invited to attend.

Thermometer Reads $300
As Mercury Passes
Half-way Mark

   

A study of the YWCA faculty
ﬁnance thermometer, which rises in
proportion to the promised pledges of
faculty members in the faculty ﬁnance
campaign, shows the red line already
more than half-way up to the goal.
The highest temperature possible on
the thermometer is $500, and it now
reads at approximately $300. Already
75 of the 250 faculty members have
responded. Helen Milliron, C35, chair-
man of the faculty ﬁnance campaign,
regards the campaign as very success-
ful considering that less than half of
the faculty has been interviewed by
the 35 woman solicitors.

At a meeting of all the solicitors
it was discovered that the mathe-
matics and education departments,
and the administration had respond-
ed very well. Canvassing is being
concentrated on the other depart-
ments during this week.

College Set

0‘: meiotic

Most of the sororities are too busy drawing up plans for the

‘rushing tea Sunday, November 12,

to go in for Very elaborate affairs

ihis week-end. The tea, from 3:30 to 5:30 o’clock, has no limits as
far as the form of affair is concerned. It may be formal or informal,
American, Chinese, or German—-any particular type the sororities
have a yen for. Most sororities will probably have formal teas. The

rushees will be permitted to attend‘-*

only one affair. A motion brought up
before Panhellenic ‘Souncil to allow
rushees to attend several sorority af-
fairs was dropped for this year.

By now, most sororities know whom
they are going to invite to their get-
acquainted tea, since eligibility lists
have been in Miss Rush’s oﬁice since
October 31, giving ample time for
ﬁnal checking. Silence week begins
at 5:30 o’clock, immediately after the
close of the rushing affair. They
must Say their all by 5:30, because
conversations of fraternity women
with the rushees are “ta‘boo" for a
whole week.

Not only this affair occupies the at-
tention of the Greek chapters; the
Panhellenic tea dance tomorrow
clamors for attention to Such details
as gowns, .appointmen-ts, and -such. If
you don’t know, this is the ﬁrst affair
Panhellenic Council has ever spon-
sored to which non-fraternity men
and women may come. As at all tea
dances, stagging is in order.

With all the advice about answer-
ing invitlati-ons, ‘behavior towards
fraternity women, and rushing eti-
quette, the February freshmen and
upperclass non-fraternity women need
feel no social qualms. Murial Dils,
freshman education chairman, will
lead at an assembly tomorrow at 12.30
o’clock. Ruth Lazirovitz, publicity
chairman, will assist. O Philos, the
fraternity guide book, will be Passed
out.

Eastern Rooms

 

VVhile soliciting funds in Chicago‘

last week for the China memorial
room in the Cathedral, Mrs. Yot, of
the Chinese committee, collected
three vases from David Vveber, Chica-
go connoisseur of Chinese art. One
vase is from the Sung dynasty and of
egg-plant coloring. The vase from the
Ming dynasty is of a delicate shaded
blue, large, and rather unusually
shaped, The Chien Lung dynasty

of the vases are rare specimens. They
will be used for the window of the
Chinese room.

While in Pittsburgh recently, at-
tendng the United Foreign Missionary
conference, Dr. H. C. E. Liu, presi-
dent of the University of Shanghai,
and Dr, Yi-Fang Wu, president of Gin

ed the Cathedral. Dr. Wu gave the
Chinese committee valuable informa-
tion on adapting the Chinese type of
chairs for schoolroom use, since she
is acquainted with the architect for
the China memorial room, Teng
Kwei, who also designed the buildings
for Gin Ling college. Dr, Wu has had
much experience along these lines
and gave helpful suggestions for the
ﬁnishing of the Chinese chairs of

Panther-Duke Contest

Opponents Enter
Saturday's Game
Evenly Matched

 

Victory Over W. & J. Last Week
Is Eighth For Undefeated
And Untied Bluffmen

 

Balance Pitt ln Weight

By ROBERT E, BADGER

This coming Saturday at the Stadium
Jock Sutherland’s Golden Panthers
meet the Durable Dukes of Elmer
Layden in a battle which will not
only be instrumental in deciding the
city championship but which may de-
cide the football championship of the
East.

Seldom has a game caused so much
comment and argument pro and con
in the city regarding a football game.
Persons who have never seen a game
of football are discussing, somewhat
vehemently sometimes, the chances
of the Dukes or of the Panthers in
Saturday’s contest.

The records of both teams are im-
pressive. Thus far this season the
Panthers have defeated W, & J., West
Virginia, Navy, Notre Dame and Cen-
tre, and have lost to Minnesota. The
Duquesne university team has won
eight games, defeating Waynesburg,
West Virginia Wesleyan, West Vir-
ginia, Bucknell, Western Maryland,
University of Detroit, Westminster
and W. & J . The only basis for com-
parison between -the Panthers and the
Dukes is their respective showings’
against W. & J. The Panthers were
very much extended to win over the
Presidents, 9 to 0. Last Saturday the
Bluffites in somewhat easier fashion
triumphed over them, 21 to 6. Which
probably means nothing at all.

So far as this writer is concerned
the only obstacle in the way of a
Pitt victory is any trace of over-
conﬁdence in the Panther players.
They look to have the stuff to win,
but should they go into the same
expecting something easy they are in
for a rude awakening. Elmer Layden
will place a team on the ﬁeld Satur-
‘day just as heavy or possibly heavier
than the team which will start for
the Panthers. He will have a team
which has had enough weight, speed
and power to defeat Detroit, one of
the stronger teams in the mid-west;
Bucknell, one of the stronger teams
in the east, and W. & J., of whose
ability we have some idea.

The game Saturday will probably
be attended by the largest crowd to
witness a football game in Ptts-
gurgh thus far this year, not ex-
cluding the 55,000 which saw the
Carnegie Tech-Notre Dame contest,

W. Don Harrison, graduate man-
ager of athletics at the university,
has made it possible for the war vet-
erans of the district to witness Sat-
urday’s game for 55 cents. They may
get tickets at this price by showing
their veterans cards at any of the

usual agencies.

Panthers Down

Colonels By 37-O

Passing Combination Of Matesic-
Nicksick Scores Twice

 

 

The Pitt Panthers handed the Pray-
ing Colonels from Centre college,
Kentucky, at 37 to 0 defeat at the sta-
dium Saturday. Centre made a seri-
ous threat to score in the ﬁrst period
when they completed two forward
passes to place the ball on the Pitt's
seven-yard line. ‘Centre failing in
two attempts to gain ground through
Pitt’s line tried a pass, which was
incomplete. Pitt regained the ball
when Barksdale’s attempt for a field
goal failed.

The Panthers, using a passing and
running attack advanced the ball to
the Centre three-yard line. O’Dell,
who carried the ball over on an off‘
tackle play, fumbled on the goal line
and Meredith recovered for the ﬁrst
score. In the same period “Heine”
Vveisenbaugh ran 15 yards for the
second score. Matesic and Nicksick
teamed up in a forward passing com-
bination to score two more touch-
downs.

Matesic accounted for a score in
the third period after a 15-yard run.
Wilkens, substituting for Shotwell at
center, intercepted a Centre pass and
returned it 24 yards to the Centre
seven-yard line. Rector went through
rightguard for the ﬁnal Pitt score.

Panther Runners
Beat W. Virginia

Albright And Wagonhauser Star
As Varsity, Freshman Win

 

 

Almost completely outclassing the
West Virginia university varsity and
freshman cross-country teams, the
Panther varsity and the Panther Cubs
overwhelmed the Mountaineers at Mor-
gantown last Saturday. The varsity
gained a perfect 15-40 score, while the
freshman count was 22-33. .

Albright and Wagenhauser ﬁnished
arm in arm to win the ﬁrst two
places for Pitt in the time of 29 min-
utes and 1 second. Following these
two by 43 seconds, came Lawrence,
Kirkpatrick and Musico, who also
crossed the line in a. dead heat to
give the Panthers the next three
places and assure the perfect score.
Cook, Loncher and Kopp also ﬁn-
ished before the ﬁfth Mountaineer
crossed the tape, but the scoring in
cross-country allows for only ﬁve
men on a team to place.

The freshman run brought out the
only bright spot from a. West Vir-
ginia standpoint when Gedwalis, a
stocky lad with a ﬁne pair of run-
ner’s legs, easily bested the rest of
the ﬁeld over the shortened fresh-
man course to give West Virginia a
ﬁrst place in the time of 17 minutes,
43% seconds. After Gedwalis, who
appears certain to become a sensation,
according to the Mountaineer “brains/'
came Tost, of Pitt, whose time was
21 minutes and 13% seconds. Pros-
nik and Leggin, of Pitt, ﬁnished in
third and fourth positions, respective-
ly. Long, a Mountaineer, was ﬁfth and
then came Radosevich in sixth and
Beachler in seventh place, for Pitt,

Both races were started and ﬁn-
ished in the Mountaineer Stadium be-
fore a. crowd of 6,000, which had
gathered for the West Virginia-Man
quette football game. The “West Vir-
ginia Day” gathering rose to give a

nice hand to Albright and Wagon-
hausei‘ as they ﬁnished, stride for
