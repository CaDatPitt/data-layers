Tim DeVita, a junior at Wood-

Dixon .

Sparta Editor

Jermaine Dixon couldn’t stop

. crying.

Eight years old, and a battle
with AIDS had just caught up
with his mother, taking her life.
His older brothers, Juan and Phil,
picked up a basketball and made
their way toward their local court.
They showed no sign of tears.

Thirteen years later and in his
ﬁrst year with the Pitt basketball
team, Dixon understands why.

“Basketball,” said Dixon, “was
their therapy.”

Dixon, a junior—college trans-
fer from Tallahassee Community
College in Florida, is ﬁghting for
a starting guard position on the
Pitt men’s basketball team. With
returning players and a talented
freshmen class, he has some work
ahead of him on a team with big
plans. But he’s used to struggling.

Dixon grew up in Baltimore,
Md., where, in his early years, his
mother, Juanita, raised him. But
after’Juanita, who was a heroin
addict, passed away, he and" the
rest of his family wereistuck. Dix-
on and his siblings moved in with
their grandmother. That’s when
Phil, ’Dixon’s oldest brother, be-
came the family’s role model.

“Phil, he was strict,” said Dix-
on of his brother, who is now
a 34-year-old police ofﬁcer in
Baltimore. “He kind of became
the father ﬁgure. Anything I did
wrong — anything Juan did wrong
— he’d be right on us.”

But even with a role model,‘

life in east Baltimore was never
easy. Drugs and violence ran the
streets. But Dixon said he real-
ized he couldn’t waste his life. He

-couldn’t let the streets swallow

Job losses worry Obama

Obama, page 1

Sen. John McCain, highlighting
issues dealing with the economy
and reinforcing his support in
the greater Pittsburgh area.

The McCain Campaign,
Obama said, appeals to the fears
of the American people. Obama
said that this will not unite the
country when it needs a new di-

rection, instead of “more of the V

same.”

Obama also said that the Mc-
Cain campaignuses tactics that
allow him to avoid talking about
the economy. If McCain spoke
on his views about the economy,
Obama said, McCain would lose
the race. Obama said McCain
supported the deregulation of
the economy, which contributed
to the current economic tur-
moil.

“John McCain may be 'wor—
ried about losing an election,”
said Obama, “but I’m worried
about Americans losing their
jobs, their homes.”

Obama went on to say that he

would not raise taxes on the U.S.

middle class, and he would roll _

back President George W Bush’s
tax cuts for the wealthy. Obama
said that McCain’s plan would
give money to the same bankers
who began the current economic

I . .
C1’1SlS.

Obama also justiﬁed his sup-
port for Congress’ $700 billion
bailout plan by saying he thinks
it will stop foreclosures.

According_to Obama, 760,000
jobs have been lost this year, and
the trickle down theory of eco-
nomics, which McCain supports,
will not bring them back. Obama
said he intends to expand public
works projects in order to get
those jobs back and rebuild the
U.S. infrastructure.

The Democratic

nominee

wise pay for secondary educa-

did not mention what would pay

The Iraq war, Obama said,

he intends to tell the Iraqi gov-
ernment to step up and take con-
trol of its own nation, in order to

bring 'U.S. troops out of harm’s

way. . _

The Illinois senator empha-
sized national unity and avoided
addressing the comments about
Western Pennsylvania made by
state Rep. John Murtha, D—Pa. ‘

Remington Markos, the‘ presi-
dent of the Fairmount State

said after the event that he wasn’t
surprised Obama, the first black
presidential nominee for a major
party, didn’t mention the issue.

_ “I think the that the issue of
race is over, the issue is done.”
said Markos. “He should ‘have
addressed it, but 'it’s nottreally

Jobs

by Mike Ploetz
For T be Pitt New

Because the nation is search-
ing for alternatives to fossil fuels,
the nuclear power industry is see-
ing unprecedented growth, and
that translates into jobs for col-
lege graduates.

John Goossen, director of the
science and technology depart-
ment at Westinghouse Electric
Company, told students at Pitt’s
Nuclear Night yesterday that this
growth is occurring across the
board. Of the 11,000 workers
his company employs, 1,300 were
hired in the last ﬁscal year, Goos-
sen said.

The event also featured speech-
es from energy executives from
Bechtel Bettis Inc., FirstEngery
Nuclear Operating Co. and West-
inghouse Electric Co.

But the event’s main speaker
was Dale Klein, the chairman
of the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission, an independent agency
created by Congress in 1974 to
regulate the use of radioactive

materials in the United States.

He referred to the commis-
sion as “the best place to work in
federal government,” partially be-
cause of its growing employment
opportunities.

Advances within the ﬁeld can
be attributed to greater measures
taken by commercial nuclear pow-
er plants to provide clean sources
of energy for the country.

Klein said he is “convinced
that the future of this country
will be shaped in very distinctive
ways.”

One of these changes, he said,
is the inevitable pull away from
notoriously dirty sources of en-
ergy like coal, oil and gas.

In smaller countries, where
energy options are less numer-
ous, the nuclear energy move-
ment is slightly further along. For
example, Klein said, “France gets
80 percent of ‘its energy from nu-
clear sources.”

The United States currently
imports a great amount of its en-
ergy, a fact that may change after
the next presidential election.

Sen. Barack Obama and Sen.
john McCain have made it a pri-
ority to wean the United States
off of foreign fuel.

However, Klein said that the
nuclear industry must ﬁrst con-
vince the American public of its
value. ‘

“They don’t understand how
energy is generated,” said Klein.
‘‘We» need to educate the public
on what our real [energy] choices
are.”

Many people, the executives
said, believe that nuclear energy
is dangerous and unstable, but
the industry has undergone an
almost complete transformation
in the past 50 years. And, when
compared with oil or coal, nucle-
ar power plants can extract a far
greater amount of energy from
splitting a single uranium atom
than from forming a molecule of
carbon dioxide.

Pitt’s Swanson School of
Engineering began offering its
nuclear engineering program last
year, because there were more
jobs available than there were stu-

plentiful in nuclear power

dents studying it.

Pitt has access to unique op-
portunities, many of the night’s
speakers said, with commercial
nuclear companies located right
outside of the city.

FirstEnergy Corp., for in-
stance, has a facility in Shipping-
port, Pa., which currently employs
850 people.

The company has three sepa-
rate plants and serves approxi-
mately 4.6 million customers
across the eastern United States.

Peter Sena III, vice president
of FirstEnergy, said he remem-
bers when only 40 years ago the

nuclear energy was described as.

the “great white elephant,” about
to reach its end.

The “nuclear renaissance,” as
specialists within the field have
come to call it, is still young,
and some suggest that perhaps,
in the past, we didn’t know as
much about nuclear energy as we
should have.

Sena said, “Nuclear power is
different. It’s special. And it has
to be treated as such.”

McCain comes back from the dead

by Molly Green
Colum/ulat

  

Halloween is the season of

_ pumpkins, candy, costumes and,

best of all, horror stories. In light
of this tradition, I submit to you
the partially, but not really, true
tale of, “John McCain and the

‘ Politician Sematary.”

Once upon a time, in a faraway
land called Washington, there was
young senator named John Mc-

; Cain. In 1987, after serving just

two years in the U.S. House of
Representatives, McCain began
his senatorial career. And things,
for the most part (minus that
pesky Keating Five scandal), were
going just dandy.

You see, McCain was a fun
guy, a jokester. People liked his
«spirit. Though he was an elected
Republican, McCain wasrft afraid

to choose positions unpopular,

with his party or join strong bi-
partisan efforts for change, for
example his coalition with Sen.
Russ Feingold, D—Wis., to imple-
ment campaign ﬁnance reform.
One might even call him —- dare
I say it —— a maverick.

Though the McCain-Feingold
Reform Act was perhaps McCa-
in’s No. 1 achievement, he cham-
pioned other unpopular issues,
like curbing pork barrel spending,
climate change and anti—tobacco
industry legislation ‘

Fastforward to 2008. It’s been
more than 20 years since our fa-
vorite maverick was ﬁrst elected
to the Senate, and things are going
pretty well. McCain just received
the Republican nomination for
the 2008 presidential election.
He’s got a pen, a lapel pin, a plat-
form prepared to solve the en-
ergy crisis, the housing crisis, the
health care crisis and more, all the
while naively assuming ‘that he
could do away with partisanship
and unite the country.

But then, one day, something
terrible happened. Not many
know this — according to my il-
legitimate sources, it was carefully
concealed by ' a powerful group
of senators who I will not name
—— but McCain was involved in a
freak drift—racing accident.

It was a dark, gloomy day, and
poor McCain just wanted’ to test-
run wife Cindy McCain’s prized
drift car. He had often admired it
from afar, but she had never let

him drive it, because he could be p

a clumsy one, that McCain. Ap-
parently, rightfully so. The details
of the crash are not important,
only its tragic outcome: McCain
did not survive. I
i As you can imagine, the Re-
publican Party leaders were in
quite a tizzy. Who could they
replace him with? Mitt Romney?
Nay. Huckabee? No, no. People
got over the whole weight—loss/
guitar thing a while ago. It had to
be McCain, and now, everything
was ruined.
Or was it?
You see, the Senate had a se-

cret. A terrible, treacherous se- I

cret. Hidden several dozen feet
below the Library of Congress is
an ancient cemetery. According
to senatorial legend, this cem-
etery has a great power: It can
bring politicians back from the
dead.

However, the cemetery is
greatly feared, because though it
has the power to revive the dead,
those who return are somehow
different, changed  evil.

It is called, the “Politician Se-
matary” (Senators are notoriously

‘bad spellers).

Votes should be based on po

by Hayavadhan Thuppal

Co/um/uidt

It’s funny how often
ﬁction provides valuable insight
into real life. This past weekend, I
went to see the Pittsburgh Public
Theater’s production of “Radio
Golf,” August Wilson’s ﬁnal play.
Set in 1997, it follows the story of
Harmond Wilks, a black Pittsbur-
gher running for mayor.

The parallels are apparent:
With a black man running for
president, the issues brought up
in “Radio Golf” are more than
relevant to how Americans, re-
gardless of race, are approaching
November’s election.

In the play, Wilks is a privi-
leged, Ivy League—educated real-
tor who suddenly ﬁnds himself in
the political spotlight. But as his
campaign develops, Wilks is pres-
sured to mold his campaign into
what others want it to be.

His wife and campaign man-
ager, Mame, continually reminds

Wilks that he needs to appease
the important people of the city,
regardless of how he feels about
them personally. Despite his mis-
givings about the police chief,
Wilks must restrain his anger in
order to maintain his political
support. '

Equally polarizing is Sterling,
Wilks’ boyhood friend, who wants
the candidate to be “the mayor
for black folks.” Having grown up
in Pittsburgh’s Hill District, Wilks
can empathize with the hardships
of black Americans there.

But Wilks does his best to

strike a balance between the two. .

He claims that he is “going to be
the mayor of everybody. It’s not
about being black or white, it’s
about being American.”

As the story continues, his mis-
sion becomes increasingly more
difﬁcult. Wilks’ relationship with
the Hill deepens as he discov-
ers social and familial ties. Even
though he is unable to abandon
his history, Wilks comes to the

realization that he must distance
himself from the past if he is to
win the election. '

This conﬂict is_made doubly
apparent with posters of Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King and Tiger Woods
on opposing ends of the stage.

Written in 2005, Wilson was
able to forecast the issues that
Sen. Barack Obama has had to
deal with for the span of his can-
didacy. “Radio Golf,” however,
presents its ideas more openly
and honestly than any politician
or news outlet ever has. The dia-
logue is real and unﬁltered, raising
questions about this year’s elec-
tion that have often been brushed
aside as too controversial.

Is Obama in touch with the

. black community? Will he be a

president for black Americans? Is
he too black? Is he black enough?

Wilson’s play doesn’t provide
an answer because there isn’t one.
But unless these questions are
discussed, and in a forum that
doesn’t heed political correctness,

there will always be a lingering de-
bate.

Even when issues of race or
racism have arisen for the Obama
campaign, we have been quick to
appear outraged and quicker still
to take them out of the spotlight.
When Obama addressed the na-
tion following the comments of
Rev. Jeremiah Wright in March,
a dialogue on race (in both the
political and social realm) was
about to unfold. But since then,
America has done exactly what
Obama warned against. We have
“walk[ed] away  retreat[ed] into
our respective corners.”

Since March, race has slowly
disappeared from the election
conversation. Perhaps more im-
mediate issues like the economy
have taken its place. And this is
not entirely a bad thing. As race
becomes less of a polarizing fac-
tor, the American people can
make a more informed choice.
One based on policies, not preju-
dice.

litics, not prejudice

-But it’s no longer Ojbama’s re-
sponsibility to engage the discus-
sion. He’s already asked America
to recognize race as one of its
foremost issues. Even if it doesn’t
resurface until after the election
(regardless of who wins), the de-
bate would still be valuable.

Like Harmond Wilks, Obama
is being pulled in two different
directions. There’s no doubt that
people like Wright want Obama
to be the president for black
America. And there’s no doubt
that people in Obama’s campaign
ofﬁce are asking him to down-
play his ethnicity. But like Wilks,
Obama is pursuing, as he claims,
change for all Americans.

Though it doesn’t provide the
answers, Wilson’s play evokes es-

A sential questions at a time when

race, in less than two weeks, will
consciously, or subconsciously,
sway voters.

tions (See: Albert B. Fall, Teapot Dome
Scandal), the decision was made to hide
the cemetery and to never use it again. The
entrance was then strategically tucked be-
hind a biography of Rutherford B. Hayes,
a book that the senators wisely assumed
would otherwise never be touched.

That is, until this summer.

The night of McCain’s tragic accident, a
small band of senators —— the last remain-
ing who knew the terrible truth about the
cemetery — met and agreed to revive Mc-
Cain.

The senators had hoped that maybe this
time, things would be different. That their
old pal john would come back, same as
ever, ready and waiting to play a round of
golf just like old times.

But the senators were wrong.

McCain returned, but not as the princi-
pled, steadfast man he had once been, but
as something different, something more
manipulative.

At first it was just little things that had
changed. McCain’s once lively eyes had be-
come dull, his skin withered.

He would grit his teeth and ﬂex his
ﬁngers menacingly at debates and media
events.

Then there were bigger changes. Mc-
Cain, who had always championed consis-
tency and standing by one’s opinions, even
if unpopular, began to change his policies.
Soon McCain was changing his opinions
on everything from Roe u Wade to tax cuts
to regulation of Wall Street, even his own
campaign ﬁnance reform legislation.

Not only did this new McCain change
in attitudes, but in behavior as well. McCa-

in, who had earlier denounced mudslinging
and negative campaigning, began antago-
nizing Sen. Barack Obama in his commer-
cials, pamphlets and speeches more than
promoting himself. ’

While it’s unclear how this particular
horror story will end, one would hope that
the senators who reopened the Politician
Sematary would learn their lesson once
and for all.

Modern jazz scene sizzles in Pittsburgh
City a cross-section of urban styles

by Kieran Layton
Staﬁ’ Writer

Pittsburgh jazz history has
unknowingly affected millions
of adults and children who may
be unaware that “Mister Roger’s
Neighborhood” harbors a local
jazz legend.

Joe Negri, or Handyman Ne-
gri on the show, is a jazz guitar-
ist who has seen the evolution
of jazz in Pittsburgh from the
ushering in of bebop style to the
present day, where jazz remains a
popular form of entertainment
in the city.

“Pittsburgh has never had its
own style [of jazz]. It’s like the
city itself 4 gritty and hardwork-
ing, and it just keeps on going,”
said Negri.

Negri refers to the idea that
Pittsburgh has never been de-
fined in the discourse of jazz
music in the manner of major
cities like New York and Chica-
go. Pittsburgh has always been a
stopover town for big artists, and
subsequently, the musical atmo-
sphere is more relaxed, but it has
felt the changes that rocked the
jazz scene as a whole.

At the end of the 1930s and
well into the ’40s, jazz music
saw an incredible shift in perfor-
mance, technique and composi-
tion. In nightclubs everywhere,
bebop slowly replaced the popu-
lar swing style, and some who
pushed this trend forward came
from here in the Steel City.

Nathan Davis, a jazz professor
at Pitt and a first-hand witness to

Pittsburgh’s jazz history, named
Art Blakey and Kenny Clarke as
“two people who changed the
history and direction of jazz.”
Both are drummers, and both
are considered inventors of the
bebop style of drumming, which
emphasizes fast playing and a lot
of improvisation.

 

Pittsburgh has never had its
own style... It's like the city
itself — gritty and hardwork-
ing, and it just keeps on going.

  

Joe T ,
l\e§gr:

Art Blakey- was used to rub-
bing elbows with his local peer
innovators like Mary Lou W/il-
liams and Billy Eckstine, but he

also hadthe chance to drum with .

legends i5 like Miles Davis. His
band, The jazz Messengers, was
one of the first big jazz bands
that adopted bebop style, which
is tailored more toward individual
artists. So.mehow,Blakey made it
work forhim. ' 9

“Kenny Clarke changed the
way drums are played today,”
said Davis, and he wouldknow
-— Clarke was Davis’ mentor as a
musician.

Clarke’s major contribution
to jazz is his style of . playing the
main beat of a piece on the ride
symbol to keep time, while ac-

centing with another percussion

piece, like the bass drum. This is
a cornerstone of bebop style, and
it came from a Pittsburgh native.

Davis, before coming to
Pittsburgh in 1969, worked with
Clarke seven nights a week for
seven years and said he has spent
more time playing with him than
probably any other musician.

Both Davis and Negri agree
that jazz has not seen a change in
trends like the bebop revolution,
but rather that jazz in Pittsburgh
has merely maintained a steady
artistic current through the de-
cades.

Davis talked about a mainte-
nance worker at the \William Pitt
Union when he first arrived at
Pitt who was alternately Bass or
“Shelly” McMahon. A talented
cellist, the latter nickname was
given to him by his fellow musi-
cians because they were unfamil-
iar with a jazz musician playing
the cello.

This anecdote is typical of
the jazz scene is Pittsburgh, Da-
vis said, and is evidence of the
overall atmosphere the city has
adopted toward jazz music.

\While there have been Pitts-
burgh jazz artists within the past
few decades who have received
substantial acclaim, like saxo-
phonists Eddie Harris and Tony
Campbell, Pittsburgh seems to be
a city that, while arguably on the
same talent level as bigger cities,
will never be on an equal level of
production.

And apparently, the Pittsburgh
jazz artists don’t seem to mind.

by Sarah Simkin
Staﬁ’ Writer

The Gem Parrenger, the second
album ﬁorn former Something Cor-
porate Erontman Andrew McMa-
ho'n’s new band _]ack’s Mannequin,
comes from a far deeper place than
most records —.—— it was written fol-
lowing his successful recovery from
leukemia. '

A T/ye G/an Patrmger explores all
the complex emotions invoked by
his illness while staying true to his
‘pop roots McMahon took time out

of promoting the new album for a -_

quick chat with The Pitt News I _

_The Pitt News: The name of
your new album, T/ye G_éz.tr Patrenger,
came from a song lyric that isn’t on
the album. How did you decide to
keep it?

Andrew McMahon: I never
ended up ﬁnishing that song, but I
wrote that lyric down and it just reso-
nated; The whole line was “Keep
your eyes on the road / I’m a glass
passenger / And I  for a traveling
ban .” Those three words that just
seemed so loaded and so charged.
Then as the album and the 
process progressed, it seemed to real-
ly speak to the record as a whole and

a lot of the themes in the album.

TPN: What were the main in-
ﬂuences on the difference in sound
fromjacks Mannequins debut Eyegl-
tbing in Tnzmit to the new album?

AM: I think the approach alone
was pretty. different in itself. Wfith
Evegitbing zh Tramiz; there was this or-
ganic development and kind of free
flow, more of a stream of conscious-
ness  really. It was never intend-
ed to be a record, just thrown togeth-
er.This timelknewlwasmakinga
record, so the bar got raised

TPN: Do you have a favorite

song off this album or a favorite to

perform?

AM: My favorites change from
daytodayasitkindofsinksin.
“Crashin”’ was the breakthrough
song, it’s really what began the al-
bum, which is why it’s the first track
There was a moment where I sat
down and was like, “You’re 
a record, start  this record,”
and that pushedme through. But,
you know, you make a record, it’s like
having a kids. You love them all for

all their different qualities, andvyou .

can’t pull one aside and say, “This is
my favorite.”

«

TPN: What do you hope people
will take away from Tbe G/arr Paym-
ger; is there a message you want to
come across? ’

’ AM:.The album is an exploration
on hope from what I consider to be
some exceedingly hopeless places A
big part of what went into this was
my re-acclimation to the world. I had
idealized what the world would be

' while I was sick, I assumed I would

just wake up well and live in utopia or
some sort of perfect place So I think

a lot of the record is me adjusting to

the real world and reintegrating to a
normal lifestyle after what had been
a very dramatic set of years through
the recovery. I wanted to be truthful
about some of the reality I was fac-

mg-

TPN: I saw you crowd surf at
the Electric Factory in Philadelphia a

‘ few years ago. Is that a tradition?

AM: Ah, ' the infamous crowd
surf to barricade, I remember that I
used to do it every show, but it started
to get predictable so I started doing it
a little less. Still, if the crowd seems so
inclined, I will take a dive.

new album, T/Je G/an Passenger.

Andrew McMahon provides
the band with his signature pia-
no—rock and vocals, in addition
to writing all the songs. Bobby

supplies backup vocals, while Jon-
athan Sullivan is on bass and Jay
McMillan is on drums.

hon was diagnosed with leukemia
in June of -2005, tragically and
ironically on the day he ﬁnished

the last song for ]ack’s Manne-
quin’s first album, Eveglt/ring in
Tramit. The album was released
two months later, debuting at No.
37 on Billboard’s Top_200 Albums
and embraced by both fans of
McMahon’s previous work and
critics alike.

Lyrically, T/ye G/an Passenger is
somewhat less than one has come
to expect from McMahon, in addi-
tion to "the distraction of complex
overlays andishirnmery studio ef-
fects —— a shame considering that
some of the band’s best tracks are
simple acoustic versions.

McMahon transitioned into
a more confessional, less elegiac
style after his departure from the
band Something Corporate, and
this album continues that trend to
less than stellar results. While his
hooks and melodies have always
been excellent,’ what distinguished
McMahon was the intertwining
of his intense piano composition
skills with beautiful lyrics, typi-
cally both simultaneously precise
and vague enough to feel like they
could apply to anyone’s life.

We only have one week to go

most important election of our
lifetimes, but the polls indicate that
some Americans still haven’t de-

nominee would be best equipped
to handle a crisis of cinematic pro-
portions?

Seriously, movie
have it tough. Nuclear wars, earth-
destroying asteroids, alien" inva-
sions that don’t just occur at the
Mexico border — it’s tough to be a
movie president. So if worse came
to worse, could Obama or McCain
cut it?

In “Independence Day,” aliens

But while Jeff Goldblum and The
Fresh Prince give the mother ship

Obama is unquestionably the
better orator of the nominees, so
score one for him — remember
that killer speech the president
gave at Area 51? But then, Bill Pull-
man’s prez is also a combat veteran
who pilots a ﬁghter plane in the
ﬁnal skirmish with the aliens. Mc-
Cain, a ﬁghter pilot himself, would
likely be better equipped to handle
this type of international crisis.

of the top 10 movie presidents
suggests that Americans are less
concerned with aliens, however,
than they are with the commander-

Michael Douglas ranked higher
in preference than Pullman for his
role in “The American President.”
McCain might have the advantage
in this movie, too — like Doug-
las’ character, he fell in love with
a beautiful young woman. But

unlike Douglas’ character, he was H

still married to someone else at the

Still, the popularity of this,ﬁc—

administration would be success-
ful.

Harrison Ford in “Air Force One.”

esidents reflect the real deal

scenario is clearly a McCain vic-
tory. Unlike Ford’s character, how-
ever, he likely doesn’t know how to
use a cell phone.

But then, not all crises can be
solved with jet planes and one-
liners. Look at “Deep Impact,” the
1998 big—asteroid-destroying-earth
movie that isn’t “Armageddon.”

Morgan Freeman has a sup-
porting role as a president who
solves a worldwide crisis with car-
nestness, diplomacy and steadfast
resolve — qualities that we see in
Obama. Want to notice something
else they have in common? Go
ahead  racist.

Of these movie presidents, the
top four in the aforementioned
poll, three are notably similar to
this election’s elderly nominee. So
there you have it, undecided vot-
ers — if you’re looking for a fu-
ture president who could possibly
emulate a highly improbable, com-
pletely ﬁctional scenario involving

aliens, terrorists or sexy lobbyists,

vote McCain. Personally, I’m more
concerned about giantasteroids.
Oh, and the economy.

Zack and Miri make a

perfect popcorn ﬂick

by Kieran Layton
Stzzﬁ’ Writer

Zack and Miri Make a Porno

Starring: Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Jason
Mewes '

. Director: Kevin Smith
View Askew Studios .

Think of it as the feel-
good porno ﬁlm of the
. year. ’

ii If you’ve been aching
for that added touch of
romantic sentiment in
your skin ﬂicks, then Kevin Smith’s latest
effort will ease your pain.

Unless you’ve been living under a rock
for the past month, you’ll know “Zack and
Miri Make a Porno” isn’t actually porn —

 
  

, it’s about two roommates and their misﬁt

friends who make one. Yes, there is plenty
of sex, and the vulgar language is promi-
nent enough to undoubtedly spark Tipper
Gore’s interest, but at it’s core, this is just
a romantic-comedy with copious sex and
nudity tacked on.

The two title (characters live in a mea-
gerjapartment in Pittsburgh —— and in a
particularly relatableiset of circumstances
given the current economy — and ﬁnd
themselves so backed up on bill payments
their utilities are turned off and eviction is
eminent. ' A

Zack’s (Seth Rogen) solution to their
ﬁnancial woes? Make a porno starring him-
self and lV[iri (Elizabeth Banks).

 

Zack (Seth  and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) take a look at the ﬁner things in life for

some inspiration of their own.

Before delving into the adult ﬁlm busi-

ness, Zack and Miri are presented as de- ‘

pressingly average 20-somethings. Basically,
they’re the losers most college students fear
they will become after graduation, and un-
fortunately, it’s a sad reality that not every-
one becomes rich just by attaining a college
degree. .

A hilarious high school reunion scene
reminds Zack and Miri of this, and it is es-
pecially cringe-inducing to watch Miri try
to seduce her recently gay, high school jock

crush (Brandon Routh). The crush’s porn-
‘star boyfriend is amusingly played by Jus-

tin Long, and judging by his acting, he still
makes it work, but just barely.

It is this boyfriend who plants the idea
in Zack’s head, and off the ﬁlm goes down
the Yellow Dick Road.

The scenario is ridiculous-plausible in a
.“Weeds” sort of way. The audience knows
that things will work themselves out even-
tually, thus, the means to the end are forgiv-
ably justiﬁable, however ludicrous they may
be. _ .

Predictable sequences ensue where the
friends audition actors, pick a theme and ti-
tle for the movie (“Star Whores,” anyone?)
and ﬁnally shoot their ﬁlm at Zack’s place

of employment, a Starbucks—esque coffee

shop that doubles as a porno set by ‘night.
All of these are minor contrivances, as

the driving narrative force is the sex scene i
Zack and Miri agree to do together. They V

are best friends, and in_the midst of boobs
and fornication, the ﬁlm quite blatantly be-

‘ comes a study of the politics of sex be-

‘ Porno, page 12.

tween friends.

Rogen and Banks, who is easily one of
the most prominent actresses of this fall’s
movie season, share a chemistry that will be
familiar to anyone who has a good friend
of the opposite sex. They are so comfort-
able with each other that romantic develop-
ments that could otherwise come across as
sappy and contrived shift into oddly tender
territory. A

The supporting cast keeps the ﬁlm’s co-
medic pulse steady. Jason Mewes, a Smith
staple, is the main male lead in Zack and
Miri’s ﬁlm, and his utter weirdness is simul-
taneously endearing and off—putting. Two
real porn actresses, the infamous Traci
Lords and current star Katie Morgan, ap-

pear in the ﬁlm and prove that their acting
abilities go beyond moaning and that they
possess true comedic talent.

. To describe the comedic sequences
and best bits of dialogue would be to ruin
much of the fun in the movie. And because
the ﬁlm was shot in Pittsburgh, it should
be especially intriguing for a Pitt audience.
Looking for familiar landmarks inthe ﬁlm
provides added amusement. ’

The jokes land, head—on almost every

time, with a few extremely notable excep-

tions. Without going into detail, I think it’s
safe to say that anal sex is not and has never

been funny. And if it was before, abandon i

all hope ye who don’t turn your heads away
in time. You-’ll see what I mean.
On that note, this reviewer is far from

a prude, but be warned —— this film was

inches away from being released with an
NC-17 rating and is about as crass as. it
gets. It is undeniably funny, but certainly
not for everyone. I wouldn’t be surprised if
the Dutch Rudder becomes the next staple

‘ of frat houses across the country.

As is the case with almost every recent
and successful gross—out comedy, there
must be some sweet undertone, and in this
case, it deﬁnitely takes over in the end.

Zack and Miri are interesting enough,
and their (heavily advertised) ﬁlmed sex
scene is equal parts awkward, charming and
funny, but their. story becomes so predict-
able, the audience almost ﬁnds themselves
wishing for more vulgarity. I suppose this is
as close as anyone will ever get to a roman-
tic—comedy/ porno hybrid.

If only Julia Roberts had thought of it
ﬁrst.

“It’s just been about the music,” said
Negri. “There has never been a strong pro-
ducing or recording force.” A

Even Negri, while on “Mister Rogers,”
found himself still performing and also

teaching atjlocal universities like Carnegie .

Mellon. He likes to think that he‘ “kind of
had it all.” ‘

And tod_ay, perhaps this is what best ‘

deﬁnes Pittsburgh’s jazz scene. There is a

pool of talent that has churned out jazz"

movers since the start of the genre itself,
and Negri believes there is no seeable end

to potential for the next great jazz artist.
With Pitt’s acclaimed jazz seminar, a

year-long program of .free jazz concerts

called ]azzLive through The Pittsburgh‘

Cultural Trust, and historical venues like . I

the Crawford Grill maintaining steady busi-
ness, jazz is still alive and thriving in Pitts-

Men's Basketball

With Fields still healing, battle

for second guard spot heats up

by Adam Littman

Seizior Staﬂ Writer
Heading into the season, the
Pitt men’s basketball team faces a
few questions. They’re mostly sur-
rounding inexperienced players

who are being asked to contribute’

right away.

But the biggest question right
now is the status of senior point
guard Levance Fields, who broke
his foot Dec. 29 against Dayton.
He missed the next 12 games, but
came back in time for the end of

the regular season and postseason

tournaments.

Over the summer, Fields was
rehabbing when he and doctors
realized there was an infection in
his foot, which slowed down his
recovery. He had another surgery
and is still recovering.

Pitt coach Jamie Dixon ‘said that
he thinks Fields should be ready
for the first game of the season,
which is on Nov. 14 against Fair-
leigh Dickinson. Dixon also noted

they thought Fields would heal over
summer before he had his setback,

so they also can’t accurately predict
exactly what will happen.
Fields didn’t play in the Blue-

Gold scrimmage at Fan Fest on
Sunday, but Dixon said Fields has
been practicing with the team, and
they’re just being precautious.
“We’re giving him a lot of time,”
said Dixon. “We were Very conser-
vative last year, and we’re being
even more conservative this year.”
He added that during practice,
Fields has been able to run and
make cuts.
Men’s freshmen healing
Freshmen Travon Woodall and
Dwight Miller both missed time
leading up to, and including, the

season’s first few practices.

The Littman Test

Texas Tech kicker 

knows how to inspire

by Adam Littman
Senior Staﬂ Wrder

 

There is no such thing as a
perfect team.

I don’t care what Mercury
Morris says. It’s just impossible.

Just look at the current Texas
Tech football team. The Red
Raiders are 8-0 and ranked No. 6
in the nation. Yet they’re turning
to a fan to kick for them.

You heard that, right? (Note:
That’s for those of you listening
to the audio bbok of this col-
umn). A fan.

But, Adam, how could suchpa
great team do that? Good 
you asked, inquisitive reader. You
see, Texas Tech has had some is-
sues with kickers this year. Com-
bined, senior Cory Fowler and
freshman Donnie Carona missed,
six point-after-touchdowns arid
made 50 percent of their ﬁeld
goals this season. You could
also say they missed 50 percent
of their ﬁeld goals this season if
you’re a pessimist. ‘F J

Pitt senior Jennifer Kritch ﬁghts for the ball in a previous matchup against Georgetown. Pitt made the
Big East tournament this season after missing it last year.

 

by Lauren Kirschman

S tzzff Write/'

After the Pitt women’s soccer
team tied Villanova earlier this
month, Pitt coach Sue—Moy Chin
said she hoped to extend the sea-
son for her hardworking seniors.
And with a win over South Flor-
ida on Friday night, the Panthers
did just that.

A lone second—half goal at the
USF soccer/ track stadium proved
enough to push the Pitt women’s
soccer team past the Bulls and
into the postseason for a berth in
the Big East tournament.

The Panthers were tied with
South Florida for the ﬁnal spot in
the Big East tournament going in
to Friday’s game, but the win gave
Pitt the necessary three points to
cement a berth. The tournament
appearance marks Pitt’s third in
four seasons and is its first since
2006.

“It clinched the tournament

itt Women beat USF, advance to tourney

birth for us, and we knew that go-
ing in,” said Chin. “We treated it
as a playoff game, and we played
really well.”

Despite a good amount of
chances at the start of the game,
the first half ended in a scoreless
deadlock.

But the Panthers picked it up
in the second half.

Chin said she thought her
team dominated the second half
with the creation of scoring op”-
portunities.

Pitt forward Ashley Habbel
broke the tie with a goal in the
48th minute.

During a six—minute time peri-
od, beginning in the 71st minute,
the Panthers generated three shots
on goal by Katelyn Ruhe, Jennifer
Kritch and Rebecca Fraser.

Habbel continued to show a
ﬂair for coming up big for her
team. She netted her eighth career
game-winning goal and her third
of this season. Habbel needs two

Volleyball's struggles keep up

in Weekend's conference loss

by Randy Lieberman
Staﬂ’ W/rite/‘

The Pitt women’s volleyball
team dropped its second—straight
Big East matchup to St. John’s
on Sunday, sliding the team into
third place in the conference
standings.

The Panthers (14-10, 6-3)
siruggled to gain momentum
against the two—time Big East
champions, falling to the Red
Storm by scores of 15-25, 18-25
and 23-25.

Senior captain Kelly Campbell
fecorded her 13th double double
of the season with 13 kills and 13
digs.

“She led all players in digs,”
said Coach Toby Rens. “It shows
that a lot of her focus and inten-
sify is on defense, which is really
good.”

The loss dropped the Panthers 1

into a three-way tie with Notre
Dame and Louisville for third in

the Big East.

The Panthers, who already de—
feated Notre Dame on the road
this year, are focused on qualify-
ing for and improving their seed
in the Big East tournament, which
Pitt hosts, in late November.

“St. Johns was a good measur-

ing point for us. They’re an expe— V

rienced team and we were right
there at times,” said Rens. “We
want to not only qualify for the
Big East tournament but achieve
the best seed possible.”

Junior Michelle Rossi con-

-tributed 10 digs, and sophomore

Amy Town had nine kills against
St. johns.

Pitt dropped the first two
games of the match thanks to
hitting percentages of .062 in the
first game and .097 in the sec-
ond.

In the third game, however,
Pitt fought to close a once six-
point deﬁcit to just two at 21-19

on a block from junior Meagan
Dooley.

Dooley added a kill to keep
the two—point margin at 22-20,
but after the Panthers fought off
two match points, a St. John’s kill
eventually sealed the match for
the Red Storm.

Senior Jessica Moses added to
her career-record block assist to-
tal with five block assists to push
the total to 394 for her career.

“For her to break that record
even with ﬁve matches left, it
just says a lot about the level of
consistency she brings to practice
and competition every day,” said
Rens. “She’s one focused and de—
termined player that leads by ex-
ample by bringing a high level of
competition to every match.”

The Panthers, who are just
one win away from equaling their
win total from last season, travel
to Rutgers for a match against the
Scarlet Knights on Saturday.

While Blair improves outside shot, young guards fight for time

Notebook, page 15

\X/oodall collided with a team-
mate during a drill, which gave him
a mild concussion. Miller missed

. the last few weeks of summer

workouts and most of the team’s
practices so far with a bruised heel.
Both players are now practicing
with the team, and both played in
the Blue—Gold scrimmage.
Woodall led all players with four
assists. He also scored five points
and had three rebounds. Miller saw
limited action, splitting his time be-
tween the Blue and Gold teams.

The battle for No. 2

\With Ronald Ramon graduated,
Pitt enters the season without a
proven shooting guard, as well as
losing its best outside shooter.

Junior-college transfer Jermaine
Dixon, in his first season as a Pan-
ther after transferring from Tal-
lahassee Community College in
Florida, and sophomore Brad Wa-
namaker appear to be the favorites
for the starting spot.

“They’ve both played well,”
said Dixon of the two guards. “I
feel comfortable with how those

guys are going to perform for us
this year.”
In the Blue—Gold scrimmage,

Dixon scored 16 points, includ—'

ing hitting 3 of -5 from three—point
range.

Freshman Ashton Gibbs is an-
other player who can help the Pan-
thers’ outside shooting. He went
2-3 from beyond the arc in the
scrimmage.

“Ashton and Jermaine are very
good shooters,” said Dixon, who
recently signed a new contract.
“Travon shoots the ball well, too,
but we just haven’t seen enough of
him in practice.”

\While he might not knock
down threes just yet, power for-
ward Dejuan Blair said he too’has
been developing a bit of an outside
game. The sophomore led all play-
ers with 22 points during the Blue-
Gold scrimmage and showed off
his improved jump shot by hitting

Women’s

update: Zellous

» back to practicing after sprain-

ing her ankle

One of the star senior guards
on the women’s team also suffered
an injury, as All—American candi-
date Shavonte Zellous sprained
her ankle on the team’s first day of
practice a little more than a week
ago, said Pitt coach Agnus Ber-
enato.

Zellous practiced for the first
time last week on Sunday morning,
but only for a little bit before the
Blue—Gold scrimmage.

“We wanted to save her for the
game,” said Berenato.

The senior guard played the
entire scrimmage, scoring four
points.

Forget making the team,

just Win that big contest

Littman, page 15

of Tech’s game against Massachusetts.
Williams was told to stop by head coach
Mike Leach’s ofﬁce during the week.

Shortly after, Williams was practicing
with the team. And this past Saturday he
saw his first action. He kicked for the Red
Raiders against Kansas, then ranked No.
23 in the country.

Williams led, well not led, but assisted
in a 63-21 rout of Kansas. He didn’t at-
tempt any ﬁeld goals, but went 9-9 on
PATS. Corona attempted the only ﬁeld
goal on the day, missing from 43 yards.

How great is that? Think of it like
“Rudy,” but much more enjoyable because
it doesn’t involve Notrc Dame.

It might seem odd to place a fan in
such an important game, and one on the
road, but Williams does have some kick-
ing experience. He transferred to Texas
Tech after attending Tarleton State, in
Stephenville, Texas, where he walked on
the Division II school’s football team as a
kicker. He didn’t attempt any kicks while
on the team, though.

But it wasn’t just his prior experience
that made Leach conﬁdent in his new
kicker.

“I thought the tough one was winning
the free rent,” said Leach to reporters
after the game. “You come out in your
shorts and your street shoes and you have
to kick a 30—yarder in front of 55,000 peo-
ple. That was tough.”

Now, normally a transfer student would
have to sit out a year before joining his
new team, per NCAA regulations.

But the NCAA made an exception in
this case, because, according to the Asso-
ciated Press, Williams didn’t attempt any
kicks at Tarleton, nor was he recruited by
the school or there on scholarship.

I think we can all read between those
lines, though. This wasn’t about scholar-
ships or attempted kicks.

No, the NCAA knows a story when it
sees one, and this is quite a story. The type
of story that movies are made out of and
from which urban legends are born. L

This could be the push teams — pro-
fessional and collegiate — need to ﬁnally
allow fans to play for them.

It’s not as extreme as it sounds, there
is somewhat of a precedent for this. Look
no further than Eddie Franklin and Henry
Rowengartner.

What? You don’t know about the fan
that coached the New York Knicks to the
NBA Playoffs and saved the franchise
from moving to St. Louis, or the 12-year-

old who was taken from the bleachers of
Wrigley Field to pitch for the Cubs?

Granted, those happened in movies,
“Eddie” and “Rookie of the Year,” to be
speciﬁc.

But those are two of the ﬁnest sports
movies ever made, and if you don’t think
that counts for something, then I just
don’t think we can be friends.

If Williams is successful, or better yet,
continues his success, it won’t be the kiss
cam or T—shirt gun that excites fans at
sports games anymore. It’ll be a chance to
suit up for the second half.

A month of free rent is nice, as are
cash prizes or tickets to a future game, but
it’s time to up the ante, sports teams.

Make a shot from half—court during
a basketball game? Lace up your sneaks
buddy, you’re starting at shooting guard in
the second half. Just a bit of advice, this
Kobe guy you’re guarding is pretty good,
but just try to have fun. _

Knock in a shot from center ice dur-
ing intermission" at a hockey game? Well
hope you like the smell of sweat, cause
toss on these goalie pads and get between
the pipes. 1

Times are hard. I mean, man, this
economy, you know.

What better way to get people to buy
usually overpriced tickets to sporting
events than to present them with a shot at
playing in the game?

We fans need this. Williams isn’t just
doing this for the free rent, which he had
to turn down as to not violate NCAA
rules.

He’s doing it for all of us who had to
give up sports for one reason or another,
usually because we weren’t good enough
to continue.

So this Saturday, when Williams is kick-
ing against No. 1 Texas, I’ll be watching
intently.

And you should, too. If he does well,

and Tech pulls off the upset, imagine‘

where it can take fandom.
Heck, even if Tech loses, but Williams
plays well, it could open doors, especially

1 those leading to locker rooms.

Who knows, maybe next year you could
crush Williams’ dream by blocking one of
his ﬁeld goals.

After all, you’ll be on the team because

-you’ll likely win the inaugural “Guess

What Number the Coach is Thinking Of”

Pitt hits the road to face Louisville

Soccer, page 14

more goals to pass Cande Ruiz

and claim Pitt’s career scoring -

record. Ruiz set the record of 18
goals during her time as a Panther
from 1998-2001.

Pitt goalkeeper Morie Kephart
ﬁnished with two saves and her
fourth shutout of the season. In
the 80th minute, South Florida’s
Jeanette Dyer produced one of
the Bulls’ best scoring opportu-
nities, but Kephart came up with
the save.

Not only did South Florida’s
offense struggle against Pitt’s
solid defensive showing, but the
Panthers tallied more scoring op-
portunities throughout the game.
Pitt produced six shots on goal,
while the Bulls only managed
IIWO.

“It was a great win for us
and a great win for_the program
to clinch a spot for the Big East
tournament,” said Chin.

While Pitt clinched a berth
in the tournament with the win
over South Florida, its good for-
tune didn’t continue against Mar-

 

quette.

On a windy Sunday afternoon
at Valley Fields, the Pitt women’s
soccer team fell short in a 2-0
loss.

It was Pitt’s last regular season
game. ' i

“The wind was gusting up to
30 mph,” said Chin, “but there

was a steady wind around 20-25 ,

mph.

“After a very emotional game
on Friday and having to travel
Saturday, we didn’t start out as
well as we would have liked.”

Pitt fell behind early, and the
deﬁcit was too much to over-
come.

With the loss, the Panthers
ﬁnished the regular season with
a record of 7-11-1 overall and
4-6-1 in the Big East, while Mar-
quette improved to 10-6-3 overall
and 6-3-2 in the conference.

‘‘\We’ll just go back, rest and
recover and get ready for Louis-
ville on Thursday,” said Chin.

Kickoff on Thursday is setfor
7 pm.‘
