Coal
Corporation
Negotiated  

By ANN O'CONNOR

Pitt and Bituminous
Research (BCR) have agreed to

cooperate in the formation of a new '

corporation, but the arrangement is
still in a state of negotiation, accord-
ing to Jack Freeman, senior vice-
chancellor of administration. ,

Freeman said that although the
Board of Trustees and BCR have
agreed on an approved set of princi-
ples, the company has raised some
issues in the negotiation process.

BCR has been involved in coal-
related research for 50 years and
used to be funded by private gifts
and a large amount of federal fund-
ing. Freeman said the corporation
has established a strong national
reputation, but the controlling con-
sortium, which consists of coal com-
panies, manufacturers and miners,
no longer believed that BCR was in
its best interest.

To ensure BCR’s continued oper-
ation, Pitt was approached by the
consortium participants.

Freeman said the transaction is a
gift of the physical assets of the BCR

plant’ in Monroeville to the univer-,

for Black History Month.

The board also approved sending
President Mark Downs and board
member Jeff Schaffer to the Confer-
ence of Student Government Asso-
ciations at College Station, Texas.
The conference trip is set at a cost of
$476.

Schaffer reported that the Stu-

to students.” Schaffer, who has been
looking into the effectiveness of the

cards, said the businesses are
happy, with the cards". and for
most part, the businesses are

New Project Will Help
‘Knowledge Gap’

By LYNNE LACEY

Twenty-five percent of all
freshmen entering college drop
out during their first year, andby
the time the remaining students
become seniors,25 percent more
have either dropped out ‘ or
transferred.

One way of helping poorly
prepared students, according to
Dr. Harry Sartain of Pitt’s lan-
guage communication depart-
ment, is to elevate their reading
and listening comprehension
skills to the level required for
success in college courses.

_ College students drop out for
many reasons, one of which is the
‘-‘knowledge gap,” according to

a s

for social or financial reasons,
are often unable to provide ade-
quate education for potentially
capable students and this creates
a major gap be-tween what high
school graduates learn and what
they need to know as entering
freshmen.

The project, “The Languages
of Discipline,” was initiated by
Sartain and Dr. Lloyd Bond of
the psychology department as a
means to study anddiscover stu-
dents’ reading and listening skills
difficulties in various academic
fields and to find ways of over-
coming them. The A study,
financed by the Fund for the
Improvement of Postsecondary
Education, is finished, and its

Pitt Student Helping”:
Leukemia Victim

By PAM cvcnvmus

The Interfraternity Council
(IFC) and the Panhellenic Asso-
ciation are considering helping a
Pitt student raise money for a girl
suffering from leukemia.

Saverio “Sam” Strati, ajunior
in the College of General Stu-
dies, is a friend of 17-year-old
Kim Caterino from Hazelwood,
who needs to undergoa bone
marrow transplant at the Fred
Hutchinson Medical Center in
Seattle. .

Strati asked IFC president
Greg Wilson and Panhel presi-
dent Lynn Wienberg if they
could solicit the help of Pitt’s
Greeks to raise money to finance
part of Kim’s operation.

Both Wilson and Wienberg
said they talked or wrote letters
to all the sororitiesand fraterni-
ties to describe the “Kim Cate-
rino Fund.” Wilson said, ,
however, that since the Greeks
have started their annual Greek
Week charity fund for the
Arthritis Foundation, Kim’s
cause would probably be a sup-
plement to the charity work. -

Since the letters were sent out
last week, Wilson said he has not
-had any response yet from the

'..indivi'dua‘l. fraternities. . _ . .  . ;. .

William Gilboy, a Hazelwood
grocer and chairman of the fund, s
said the estimated cost for Kim’s
operation, hospital stay and
medication is roughly $80,000
over what medical insurance will
cover. .

“It’s a lot of work,” Gilboy
said. “But, if you believe in the
cause, it’s worth it.” ‘

Kim’s mother, Judy Caterino,
said the operation takes only 45
minutes, but Kim must stay in
the hospital for five or six
months to recover. She also said
recovery depends on the individ-
ual, but doctors do not dismiss
the disease entirely until ‘five
years without a re-growth of ‘
leukemia cells has past.

Kim’s 16-year-old sister,
Karen, will be the bone marrow

’ donor, and she too will travel to
Seattle and remain there for at
least two weeks to recover from
her part of the operation.

The Caterinos hope to make
the trip to Seattle in early spring
and Mrs. Caterino will remain
there for the duration of Kim’s‘
stay. Karen and Butch Caterino,
her father,'.will return to Hazel-
wood about two weeks after the
operation. , ‘

ing‘ list at Hutchins-on Medical

Corporation Negotiated,

“ sity. The transfer of the physical

assets to the new corporation would
simultaneously broaden the
research base and allow Pitt to gain
access to joint research projects.
_ _In addition, certain faculty
members at Pitt would be able to
carry on research in the facilities and
although the exact role of students
has not been worked out yet, Free-
man said he expects graduate stu-
dents will be able to work or do
research in the plant. '
Financially, Pitt's “exposure. to
liability" is limited to paying
$400,000 in advance. Freeman said
the money is “working capital”
which would probably be replaced
over a period of five or six years.
In case the corporation might be a
total failure, the company would be
dissolved, its assets disposed of and
Pitt might lose some portion of the
$400,000. Freeman, however, said
that such a scenario was highly
unlikely, and,he said he believed that
Pitt had a very worthwhile
investment.

Pitt has also agreed to cooperate
with BCR to help raise money for an
endowment fund. The purpose of
the fund, Freeman said, is to ensure
long-term funding for the
corporation.

Pitt would attempt to seek private
funding by contacting various
energy and coal corporations or
individuals with a vested interest in
coal research. The money would
then be invested and the earnings
spent for the new company.

Freeman admits that some restric-
tions might be attached to the mone-
tary gifts, but the stipulations would
be very generalized and probably
mandate that the money be used for
research or towards the employment
of distinguished faculty.

The advantages of the transaction
range from the involvement of Pitt
in research to the opportunity of
faculty to utilize the BCR plant. But
Freeman repeated that “the precise
nature of the programs has not
emerged,” therefore making it diffi-

cult to assess the merits of the proj- __

.ect at this stage.

Project Aiding Knowledge Gap

continued from page one

findings have been distributed to
faculty members in_more than
200 colleges and universities.
Rather than single out a stu-
dent for special help, the study
suggests changing the methods.
used in teaching introductory
courses at the university level.

“We wanted to see how we
could make courses in a variety
of disciplines fit the students’
needs more precisely,” Sartain
explained, “and we wanted to
help, as many students as
possible.”

For two years, teaching assist-
ants have monitored introduc-
tory courses in philosophy and
psychology as ifthey were begin-
ning students, according to Sar-
tain. Each term, l5 students were

chosen from each class to partici-
pate in the study by meeting
‘weekly with the teaching
assistants.

As a result of these meetings
and from class observation, a list

of all student difficulties was.
compiled. a

Several serious difficulties
were discovered:

0 Technical vocabulary posed
the greatest difficulty for 62 per-
cent of the students in introduc-
tory courses.

0 General vocabulary was a
problem for 12 percent because it
is a skill which must be con-
stantly expanded upon as the
learner progresses.

0 Problems related to explana-
tions ofikey principles and theor-
ies affected 18 percent. The
inability to understand these
impedes the comprehension of
higher level related concepts

Smaller percentages were
noted in the study for difficulties
with metaphors related to the
particular discipline and with
sentence complexity’. \

Over 80 instructional proce-
dures and devices were deve-
loped to help eliminate students’
difficulties, according to Sartain.

“In developing the solutions,
we involved as many faculty

In other reports, Brown
announced that although a comput-
erized room selection is in the plan-
ning stages, it will take a minimum
of two years to implement.

“I am looking into alternative
methods to fill for those two years

' until they implement the computer-

ized system," Brown said. V

Brown. and Barry Greene are cur-
rently working on the installation of
benches at the Campus Bus stop
location. They said they will be dis-
tributing surveys to students very
shortly.

Mindy Goldberg discussed the
problem that students have with the
Placement Center. Goldberg cited
the seeming lack ofjobs, the effects
of the economy and the difficulty of
working with large groups of stu-

dents as the center’s
problems. K

Greene and Craig Murphy said

they are currently in the process of
organizing a chapter of the Ameri-
can Association of University Stu-
dents (AAUS) at Pitt.
c “One of the purposes of AAUS is
to ‘aid student governments in
achieving their potential,” Greene
said. He added, however, that
AAUS lS open to any student.

In other business, the board also
heard from the Academic Affairs
Committee. The committee is pres-
ently investigating the current
Course Evaluations booklet.

A report from the Governmental
Relations Committee, which is
working on lobbying. trips, was
heard. One ofits primary goals is to
lobby for tuition freeze or a maxi-
mum three percent increase, which
keeps in line with the inflation rate.

lenic Association‘ received $900 to

members as we could,” he said.

“They were all cooperative.”

One solution that Sartain cited
was the problem of technical
vocabulary comprehension in
psychology. ’

Rather than merely telling a
class a definition, the instructor
could guide his students toward
discovering the definition on
their "own, according to Sartain.
He referred to the term “meta-
cognition,” which means the
ability to monitor one’s learning.

Students are first given a
limited amount of time to read
text selection and learn its main
and supporting ideas, Sartain
explained. Students could record
the amount of information that
they think they comprehend and
then take a short test to see how
much they really\ learned. As a
result they have just checked
their own metacognition.

“This way the students learn
by doing,” Sartain said. ‘‘It adds
meaning and aids their
memory.”

By LESLIE ROSS

There’s a professor at Pitt whose
thoughts are usually ﬂoating some-
where in space. ‘

No, he’s not an Elliot, but is a
Whiteford Professor of Technology
and Energy Resources and is cur-
rently a consultant to 31 different
organizations such as NASA.

Dr. James Fletcher has been at
Pitt since 1977, when Chancellor
Wesley Posvar offered him a posi-

tion. He is studying ways to help the ’

economy improve through advan-
ces made in technology.

Fletcher received his B.S. in phys-
ics in 1940 from Columbia Univer-
sity and got his Ph. D. from the
California Institute of Technology.

Following several years of research,,

Fletcher joined the Air Force during
World War II and gained experience
with such missiles as the ICBM and
the MX, pioneering work that would
later gain him the title of “space
expert.” '
From 1954-58, Fletcher was the
associate director .of ._the Ramo-
/Wooldridge Corporation and the
director of the electronics division of
the guided missile projects-

In 1960, he was named the presi-

dent of the Space General Corpora-
tion and finally became the
chairman of the board in 1961.

In the mid-’60s, Fletcher todk on
another challenge as president of

_ the University of Utah. p
Fletcher said this wasa most trau-

matic position because of the cam-
pus unrest that was happening
throughout the country because of
the Vietnam War.

At one point, "he said, 3,000 stu-
dents petitioned and asked Fletcher
not to allow the National Guard on
campus. Fletcher said he admired
them for standing up for a good
cause, ‘but the students wanted
«results that same day. » ‘

Later in the day, '83 of the stu-
dents wereuarrested, but the demon-
stration was peaceful, he said.

I In 1971, Richard Nixon appointed
Fletcher - the administrator of
NASA,‘ a position he held for six
years before coming to Pitt. During
his tenure at NASA, he managed
such programs as Skylab, Apollo 14-
17, Voyager and the space shuttle
program. ,

As a Whiteford professor,"

Fletcher holds an endowed chair in

which the Gulf Corporation pays his

salary, travel and overhead. He
works at Pitt three days a week and
spends the rest of the time travelling
to Washington and Houston.

Fletcher said he has strong

thoughts about the military and life"

in the galaxy. 

- He said that if the country is not
destroyed in the next 50 years,
advances will be made in military
weaponry.‘ The U.S.S.R. is always
making advances in military tech-
nology. Space weapons _are being
analyzed, and Fletcher said this type
of warfare may be developed in the

' future.

As far as ‘extraterrestrials,
Fletcher said he believes there could
be intelligent life on other planets.

‘‘It would be exciting for the whole
world tolisten to a network tuning in
on other galaxies and actually hear-

‘ing something,” he said.

Fletcher is involved in a program

called the Search for Extraterres-

trial Intelligence (SETI), but he said
present antenna systems are not
developed enough to pick up any
signals from outer space. He said
that ‘perhaps in the next 50'years,
technology will have the magnitude
needed to pick up vibrations and
sound;

International Plan Developed p

By WES COTTER

Several projects have been devel-
oped by the University Center for
International Studies (UCIS) to
develop new research and better
education at Pitt.

UCIS is currently working on a
research project to survey faculty
members of Pitt and other state uni-
versities to take inventory of faculty
exprience on international affairs.

Burkhart Holzner, a member of
UCIS, is heading the project and
said the survey is interested in meas-
uring the resources of educators in
foreign language, culture and inter-
national experience. The findings,
he said, will be useful to the univer-
sity in changing curriculum, bring-
ing research to Pitt and providing a
public service. '

The project wasglecided upon at a
meeting of Pitt, Penn State, Temple
and Penn, and the four schools are
going to combine their international
expertise in an effort to serve the
state, community and themselves.

The survey will contact 2,000-

The Pitt News, Monday January 31, 1983

3,000 faculty members in the state.
Although the response is voluntary,
Holzner said the response so far has
been good. The results could be used
to serve people in the business
community.

“Pitt is introducing businessmen
to Japanese and Egyptian culture to
help trade and increase familiarity,"
Holzner said.

The survey is being funded by a
$10,000 grant to each of the four
schools from the Pennsylvania
Department of Education. The
funds are being used to hire one
part-time worker. The survey should
be complete by the end of this term

. with continuous updates being done

to ensure current information.

UCIS .is also planning a “gover-
nor’s academy” project. The project
would be a summer program for spe-
cial high school juniors, much like
the School for the Arts, in which
students will get an opportunity to
get acquainted with international
matters and get some advanced
course work, Holzner said.

UCIS is also considering estab-

cials and faculty members to discuss
matters that have international sig-
nificance. The faculty members
would consult with the officials in a
“shared role.”

The four universities also want to
set up a seminar program that would
make representatives aware of inter-
national changes that have an
impact on the state.

According to Holzner, these new
programs will increase faculty pros-
pects for research and would mean
more grants for Pitt.

UCIS in involved with the busi-
ness community in a number of pub-
lic service projects. The center
sponsors conferences which help
corporations conduct business in

‘-1?

different. countries. A few corpora- -

tions which have dealt with UCIS
are doing business with Japan,
Venezuela.and Mexico.

UCIS is interested in pulling the

amount of international studies in‘

schools to a more even level.

“It’s in the self-interest of students
who would be better prepared in
international knowledge,” Holzner
said.

Carnegie Institute is changing
its admission policy.

Starting on Feb. »I, suggested
contributions for admission to
the institute will increase from
$1.50 to $2 for adults and from
75¢ to $1 for children. Adults will
also be asked for contributions
on Saturdays, but students and ~
children will be exempt.

This system is expected to help
the institute meet its projected
deficit of 242,000 in 1983. The
admission fees have not changed
since 1980 "but are moderate in

Opinion

Battling

 Unemployment

At last it appears that the federal government will
work toward a cure for double-digit unemployment.
In this case, Congress, and not the president, may take
the lead in setting policy for the country. A number of
prominent legislators areputting together proposals,
and ajobs bill should make its way to the Oval Office
this year. An effective jobs plan, however, will face
many obstacles on its way to becoming law. I

First, and not surprisingly, President Reagan is
expected to oppose any legislation aimed at creating
jobs that might cross his desk. The “supply-siders” in
the White House generally point to ‘inflation and
government spending as the chief threats to economic
health. Jobs legislation‘, on the other hand, is- very

much a “demand-side” idea, as it is based on the belief ’

that giving moreconsumers more money to spend will
boost a slumping economy. I .

, Second, Congress will be urged by some legislators
to includesome misguided plans in the bill it submits
to the president. Under one such plan, unemployed

‘workers would receive “unemployment vouchers” in

place of cash benefits, which could be used to bargain
with employers for jobs. The government would repay
the employer for that worker’s wages up to the maxi-
mum value of the voucher, in effect, paying companies ’
to hire the unemployed. Proponents of this idea hope
that employers would retain workers after their -
vouchers expire, thus increasing total employment.

A close look at this plan shows that it seriously

L misjudges the economic problems that have brought

about today’s high unemployment. Slack demand-
particularly for American—made products—‘has forced
American companies to cut back on production and,
consequently, the work force.

Well-managed firms will not produce what they
cannot sell. In this context, unemployment vouchers
are no solution at all, for they will have the effect of
increasing production without increasing demand.

Presumably, a voucher would be worth about as
much as the direct benefits an unemployed worker
currently ~receives. Yet, for this same amount of
money—which he will turn into “demand” by going
out and spending it—a person must go to work. More
workers, of course, means more production. So the
voucher plan would bring more American goods into a
market already saturated with domestic products. It is
foolish to expect that under these circumstances com-'

. panies will hold on to workers when their vouchers

expire. — \

Economic shortsightedness regarding. jobs pro-
grams in Congress will not aid America's recovery.
Americans can only hope that thepresident and Con-
gress can approve a plan which truly addresses today’s
economic situation. I '

  Letters To The Editor    
Authority And Objectivity

Dear Editor:

A few of the issues in the Book
Center dispute are directly related to
recent exchanges on faculty evalua-

-tion. What follows is based upon the

Jan. 26 Pitt, News report on the
Book Center.

A suspended I employee alleges
that “They (Pitt). cited my perfor-
mance appraisals as being subjec-

tive.”-This implies that management .

chose to disparage appraisals
because the appraisals did not sup-
port a decision already made to dis-
cipline the employee. It is seldom
noticed that there is a direct‘relation-
ship between the concepts of author-
ity and objectivity.

In principle, a boss possesses
knowledge an underling does not, so
the latter acts on the basis of knowl-
edge external to him. This is a simple
definition of “objective knowledge,”
and I suggest the very concept of
objectivity is derived from authority
relationships. In a case such as this
one, the boss may now declare the
appraisals “subjective” (untrue),
becuase only the “new truth” is
“objective.” Put simply, “objective
truth” is whatever the boss says it is,

Dear Editor,

Since 1979, our government has

‘sent over half a billion dollars,

including over $150 million in mil-
itary aid, to the government of El
Salvador.” In the same period of
time, there have been 30,000 politi-
cal slayings in that country, accord-
ing to the present U.S. ambassador
to El Salvador. To understand what
this means, consider that El Salva-
dor has a population of about 5 mil-
lion. If the same percentage applied
in the United States, it would mean
that roughly one and a half million
U.S. citizens would have been the
victims . of political assassination
over the’ last three years. There is an
equation here of dollars and death.

Last year, over the Reagan
Administrations strenuous objec-
tions, Congress amended the El Sal-
vador section of the Foreign Aid bill
to stipulatethat the president would
have to certify human rights in El
Salvador before the aid appropri-

ated could be released. President

Reagan issued the first such certifi-

. cation last July; this‘ Friday,',he
_renex;/edit '

his, certification. .In_ the
.‘.£*.di>Iiiii)§‘ti>"»rt in.» -,V'.*)v~‘.:*~‘».“.:

    

even though any performance

appraisal can be nothing but subjec-.

tive opinion.

Behaviorally, the purpose of eval-
uations is to assemble adverse infor-
mation to be used whenever bosses

. wish to do so. This is a deeper reason

why so many appraisal systems con-

tinually are manipulated so as to_

‘Unfortunately, universi-
ties...seem prone to follow

produce more adverse information.
In this dispute, the university
apparently takes the standard posi-
tion of declining comment “in order
to protect employees’ privacy.” It is
just as normal to find employees
busily seeking protection from their
protectors. And, of course, anonym-
ity is connected with punishment.
At a broader level, unionizing
efforts (here or elsewhere) are evi-
dence of management failure. Many

organizations have found that if

words of the State Department’s
report to Congress, “No major
reverses were registered in the com-
mitment of the government of El
Salvador to the criteria of certifica-
tion.” This is a diplomatic way of
saying that the murder, kidnapping
and torture of the people of El Sal-
vador continue. State Department
spokesperson Thomas Enders
noted, for example, that political
assassinations have been reduced
from an average of 800 a month to
less than 200 a month. The Salva-
doran Legal Aid society and human
rights organizations give a figure
which is closer to 600 a month, not
including “disappeared" persons.
But even if-Ender’s figure is an accu-
rate one, what does it mean for our
government to be sending military
aid to a regime that is killing 200 of
its citizens a month? Would Reagan
have argued that the Nazis were
“making progress” on human rights
violations because the number of
people sent to concentration camps
decreased towards the end of World

.War II? Every morning, mutilated
and; dismembered corpses appear -

along the streets and roads of El Sal-

 

workers are well treated, they feel no
need for unions. Indeed, some of the
better approaches to management
are incompatible with unionism.
When management fails to listen,
however, workers feel the need for
collective defense. ,

Correctly, I think, university
managers deplore the emergence of
adversary modes of decision-
making. They might develop better
alternatives if they sought the advice
of those familiar with such alterna-
tives, who often discuss the alterna-
tives in their courses. Unfortunately,
universities (not just this one) seem
prone to follow old-line union-
busting methods which, whatever
the outcomes, produce declining
morale.

The costs of old-line methods are
extremely . high, ultimately much
higher than would have been needed
to make. working environments.

more humane. Managers too often ;

find it attractive to believe that no
cost is too high if their authority is to
be preserved intact. ‘

An Ounce Of Prevention

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

College newspaper editors‘
usually keep the strangest hours
in relation to the rest of the popu-
lation. Because of the nature of '
their work, they often find them-
selves leaving the office at 2 or 3
a.m. «

This is also the time that many ‘
of the bars close and patrons
start making their way home in
cars. Sometimes they’re drunk;
too drunk to be getting behind
the wheel of a car.

One night last week, I left The
Pitt News office at 2:30 a.m. and
drove home to my suburban par-
adise when I encountered one of
these drunken drivers. _ .

I never gave drunken driving
much thought. It’s supposed to
be an academic in our country,
but like herpes, not many people
think about its affecting them.

As I was driving through the
Fort Pitt Tunnels, a car came up
behind me at such a high rate of
speed, I thought for sure he was
going to hit me. When I lookedin
the rearview mirror, I noticed -
that the car, a Pinto no less, was
swaying back and forth on the
road. I increased my speed to get
away from him, but he kept right
on my tail.

About 50 feet from the exit of

4 the tunnel, he passed me in the

left lane, leaving me. in a great
cloud of smoke. I counted my
blessings at this point and

iédecided to stay as far away as
‘ possible from his erratic driving.

Unfortunately, he got off at
the same exit as I did, and I had

to follow him halfway to my
front door. He was all over the
two-lane road, swaying back and
forth, increasing and decreasing
speed.’ Although the speed limit
on that road was 35 m.p.h., I did
20 to stay out of his path.

The next night, a friend of

‘mine was involved in a car acci-

dent. He had been drinking, and
on his way home, he skidded on
an icy patch and went into a tele-
phone pole. Whether or not the
accident happened because of his
drinking or because of the road
conditions remains to be seen.
Fortunately, neither he nor
anybody else was hurt. .

It is ironic that these two inci-
dents happened less than a week
after the new state drunken driv-
ing laws went into effect. The
new laws have stiffer penalties if
a drunken driver is caught.

. For example, for first time
offenders, the. person either gets
a 48-hour jail sentence or is
required to attend an alcohol
rehabilitation program. The lat-
ter seems to make the most sense

. I10 I116.

, Although drunken driving is a
problem that should be dealt
with, making offenders go to jail
just doesn’t make much sense in
some instances. For hard-core
drunken drivers, the jail sentence
probably won’t make much
difference. _

If they get caught the first time
and spend two days in jail, the
next time they drink and drive,
they’lljust be more catty about it.
They will take side streets instead
of the main drags the police fre-
quent. Or they will find another

- way to outsmart the law.

a be able to find some help from

-laws on the‘book's to protect

Rehabilitation sounds like the
best way to solve some’ of the '
problems. People who have a
definite drinking problem might

professionals who know how to
deal with this sort of thing.‘
Of course, we do need strong

innocent people from getting
killed by a drunken driver, but I
do not think suspending licenses
and spending 48 hours. in jail is
going to solve the problem.

The people who drink and
drive to excess need help for their
“affliction,” not punishment.
This situation goes hand-in-hand
with the hundreds of youths who
are locked up every year for run-
ninggaway from home. It’s help
they need, not punishment. '

Our law makers should
become more aware of the prob-
lems of drinking and driving, in
addition to knowing statistics
about deaths and injuries. They
should look at the people who
are committing the crimes and
try to stop them before they get
behind the wheel of a car or help
them if they do. . \

Most high schools have driv-
ers’ ea ucation programs, and this
would be a good place to start.
Inform the future drinkers/driv-
ers about the hazards of mixing
gas and booze. I remember see-
ing a bloody movie in my drivers’
education class about the
hazards of speeding, but I don’t
remember a film on drinking.

Like the adage says, an ounce
of prevention is worth a pound of
cure.‘ ‘g

Death Valley in the dead of summer:
it is no desirable task. If one does try
either feat, however, he’d better
know what is involved.

In his column entitled “George
Washington’s Advice and The
Mideast," (Jan. 28) Scott Rex pres-
ented an analogy involving one of
our forefathers and Israel, and then
added some talk about United
States liberals. Confused? So am I.

Granted, I am no specialist in our
government’s foreign policy. I am,
however, distraught about comfor-
table citizens living in this country
who expound their views on Israel
from their cozily-situated desktops.

Here are some facts Rex’s readers

may be interested in knowing. As
long as Israel coexists with its neigh-
bors, the Arabs, peace will never
descend upon that segment of the
world. It is an impossible task. His-
tory has proved it. Present-day cir-
cumstances prove it. The future will
show us nothing different.
_ With this in mind, it is imperative
that Israel make the best of its situa-
tion. The state exists in an area of
constant stand-by alert. The slight-
est spark can trigger explosions of
uncomparable proportions, as past
wars and battles clearly indicate..

This is also clearly why Israel con-
tinues to build settlements on the
volatile West Bank. It wasn’t too
long ago, before the June 6, 1982

'’“);invasion of Lebanon, that Israel was

constantly faced with Arab unrest
on the West Bank. Is it too naive to
think that this was created by the
PLO just for the sake of intimida-
tion? Indeed, it was. Sincethe PLO
had long ago exhausted all oppor-
tunities to cross Israel’s precarious

way to drain Israel’s manpower than
by causing unrest on the Israeli-
occupied West Bank.

And "the PLO did a pretty good
job of it~for a while. After the ter-
rorist organization got the Israeli
army’ to shoot innocent-looking civ-
ilians and forced Prime Minister
Menachem Begin to oust several
Arab mayors from office, the PLO

  W /
/ \/

made the Israelis out to be merciless.
That’s O.K. I say that because it is
always quite interesting to watch the
PLO conjure up more anti-Israel
tactics.

lt’s too bad. The Israelis got sick
and tired of PLO antics and showed
Arafat how to win a war by starting
to vaporize the PLO on June 6th.
Israel not only knows how to run a
military machine effectively, but
also knows how to retain a demo-

. cratic government.

In fact, that’s as good a reason as
any for Uncle Sam to continue to
subsidize Israel with foreign aid. If
Israel goes, so does the Mideast.
Because after the Arabs get her, the
Russians move right in with their
nuclear playthings, set up shop and
control the oil fields until they dry
up. It’s as simple as that.

. .ré'éérv'e'd r6‘rf¥ha’r,ia1i‘rig’ d"y‘h‘arfii’t‘e’-

an army into the Mideast does not
enter many minds because of our
dependence on TV. The Big Three
networks show only scenes of death
and victims of alleged Israeli.raids
when it comes to reporting on
Mideast activities.

tions.” Did you know that the presi-
dent of the United.States is required
by law to submit a report to Con-
gress every 180 days certifying that
the government of El Salvador has
made sufficient’ progress in cutting
down its “human rights violations”

* to merit continued military aid? In

How distorted. If this nation’s
viewers cared to find out what is
really happening in the Mideast, the
picture changes abruptly. Israel
intends to fight for its survival—a
survival continually challenged by
Arab dissent and furor. Ifthe Arabs,
who outnumber the Israelis, cannot
even fight an organized war against
Israel, how is it to be expected that
they can operate an organized
government?

They can’t and they .will not,_

should Israel someday disappear by
the grace of God. The Soviets would
fly into the Mediterranean area fas-
ter than the fire from an AK—47. And
when that happens, the Arabs would
not even know what hit them.

But this is all talk based on theory.
As long as adversity thrives in the
Mideast, Israel will thrive just as
well. That’s how an Israeli is brought
up; his dad is serving as a general
somewhere, he has lost two or three
brothers in previous wars, he spends
many nights in a bomb shelter.

Needless to say, the state of Israel
is unique. How else does one explain
35 years of existence while expe-
riencing five wars, endless border
battles and infinite diplomatic
entanglements? In fact, to explain
the state’s, survival is about as diffi-
cult as explaining many ofthe events
that occur in the Mideast.

This is why the Mideast is always
a,topic for writing and for debate.
There is always a new perspective to
bring out or an interesting angle that
may have been previously hidden.
Or just for the sake of argument,
there is always the Mideast.

Just remember this one para-
mount ‘point: when handling
Mideast issues, do so with thecare

other words, the Salvadoran
government must show that the
number (in thousands) ofit own citi-
zens it has killed illegally during the
past six months is smaller than the
number it assassinated during the
previous six months.

This isn’t exactly what we think of
when we think of “human rights
violations”——not in American terms
anyway. Hey, we just pay for it
around the globe, we don’t have that
situation in our country.

Whether or not the number of
political murders has decreased, it
was clear before last week that the
Reagan Administration was firmly
committed to certifying El Salva-
dor’s military oligarchy. A growing
number of United States citizens do
not appreciate this commitment.
They believe we have a commitment
of our own, which was expressed last

major factions in the country which
have publicly declared their willing-
ness to find a political solution to the
conflict. In October, the opposition,
including the guerrilla Farabundo
Marti Liberation Front, presented
directly to the Salvadoran govern-
ment a proposal for peace talks
without preconditions; in tandem,
the pope and the governments of
Venezuella, Mexico and France
offered themselves as mediators.
The government of El Salvador has
categorically rejected any dialogue
with the opposition and any effort at
international mediation.

We can only conclude that con-
tinued U.S. aid to El Salvador is
making a bad situation worse, since
the government there has no real
incentive to change its ways.

Major Breakthrough

1

Monday on “Certification Day’
when I26 persons created a human
blockade at the main entrance to the
State Department Building "in
Washington, D.C.

Pittsburgh, too, experienced a . I

major breakthrough last Monday
when City Council, following the
lead of Baltimore, San Francisco

and Detroit, approved a resolution ‘

calling for an end to U.S. interven-
tion in El Salvador. It passed with

seven in favor, one abstention and ’

one member absent.

The - resolution represents the
position of the Anti-Interventionist
movement.

An exerpt from the resolution
reads: “. . . President Reagan’s certi-
fication on human rights progress by
the government of El Salvador
ignores the true conditions in that
country. We urge Congress to reject
Reagan’s certification and to halt all
U.S. military aid and intervention in
El Salvador.” -

In light of the disparity between
what the president and City Council
are saying, it is critically important
for us to examine thesituation; to
decipher the rhetoric and to get
underneath the national myths for a
more accurate idea of what the real-
ity is in El Salvador.

There is no Soviet conspiracy to
“take over” Central America as this
administration thinks. There is,
however, a conspiracy on the part of
Ronald Reagan and his advisers to
arm a gang of killers in El Salvador
to the teeth.

It makes a person furious.

The Pitt News, -Monday January 31, 1983

By TODD ERKEL

The Panther basketball team
couldn’t'find» the basket for the first
five minutes of the game, but Trent
Johnson had little trouble remem-
bering where it was when he hit an
18-foot jumper with 45 seconds
remaining in the double-overtime
period to seal a 59-55 win over Prov-
idence Saturday at the Fitzgerald
Field House. «

The Panthers climbed back from
a 14-point second half deficit as a

reborn crowd of 5,835 fans shook ‘

the field house and their team from
the depths of lethargy as Pitt bet-
tered their record to 9-8 overall and
2-5‘ in the Big East.

Johnson’s game-winning jumper

capped another strong performance .

from‘ the senior forward who
grabbed 15 rebounds and put
through 14 points while playing
much of the second half with four
personal fouls. .

“I thought Trent was just
immense again tonight,” head coach
Roy Chipman said.

When. Providence’s Ron Jackson

Trent Johnson (L) camped out often under the boards

against Providence, scoring 14’ pts.

Spikers   Satisfied,
Defeat Buckeyes

By MARK A. SINDLER

It’s never cause to rejoice, know-
ing that an upcoming trip to Univer-
sity Park beckons on the schedule.
Well, the Penn State Invitational
beckoned the Panthers volleyball
squad this weekend with the results,
uh, more than out of the ordinary.

‘Pool play began at 9 a.m. Satur-
day when the Panthers faced Edin-
boro and easily won, 15-9, 15-10.
Making coach Ray Reilly’s weekend
a little more comfortable in the rela-
tive uneasiness of Happy Valley, was
his team’s next match against Ohio
State, ranked eighth nationally.

The Buckeyes got stuck in the first
‘game, losing 15-13, but regrouped
and handed Pitt a 15-9 defeat in the
second game. Rei11y’s freshmen-
dominated_ squad actually tripped
up OSU.

“Overall, it was a very productive
weekend," he continued. “I'd say
beating Ohio State was mainly the
biggest thing. They‘re ranked eighth
and.our.losing.t-he second game was
to be expected. But we had.a-"good

“There was some good serving
stuff as we picked on their weaker
receivers. Even the ‘defense was
excellent,” said Reilly. ’

The good news continued for
Reilly and the Panthers as the team
next put away Michigan, 1575, 15-
12. The real sour spot for the Pan-
thers was when they next met up
with Canada's third-ranked school,
Waterloo, and lost 10-15-, 9-15.
These losses, after Pitt had built up
four- and five-point leads

“Both times we raced out fast
against them,” Reilly said of the
Panthers playing Waterloo. “When
(Waterloo) eventually saw how far
down they were, though, their expe-
rience carried them and beat us.”

After the Waterloo match, junior

-Mike Peto‘ck was at a ‘loss for

explaining why he and his team-
mates could not upset the
Canadians.

“I don’t know what happened at
Waterloo," he said. “Everytime we

. went up, .we couldn‘t hit the ball

around them. We were running ever-

.ything out of_our play-sets-and all of .

hit a 20-foot shot from the corner at
the 18:32 mark of the second half,
the Friar lead was 14 and the
Panther defense still hadn’t reported
into the game.

Joey David then proceeded to put

his freshmen jitters on ice, sinking .

two foul shots and consecutive long
range jumpers on his way to 12
second half points

Billy Culbertson and Andre Will-

iams packed in the Panther’s 2,-3

zone nibbling away’ at the Provi-
dence ballhandlers and keying the
comeback. . \

“We made it a full-court game,”
Chipman said of the turnaround.
“We didn’t _ win offensively. Our
defense won this game.” ’

The Panthers ﬁnally tied'the game
for the first time at 4:38 on Trent
J ohnson’s 12-foot shot off the glass.

David followed with two more lofty e

bombs but Providence‘didn’t crack.

David then topped a night of great
offense with the defensive play of the
night, taking the ball from Provi-

dence guard R'icky"Tucker at mid-

court and laying it in for the
Panthers first lead of the game, 51-
49. 1 »

A chantof “Joey . . .J oey” lasted
through a Providence’ timeout.
Though the words were the same,
this was a different tune than the one\
the Pitt freshman heard last week at
Boston College.

‘‘It’s a whole different world,”
David said. “I guess the old saying
‘there’s no place likeihome’ holds

true.”

Otis Thorpe tied the game with
only 10 seconds left sending the
game into overtime.

Both teams could manage only a
basketapiece in a frantic five min.-
utes of the first overtime. Billy Cul-
bertson hit a pressure bank shot that
tied it at 53-53.

Culbertson hit on another shot off

‘ the glass to start the second overtime

and after’ Providence tied it at 55-55

 Panthers SCare    g

A ‘ By TAMMY ANDERSON

‘ After losing to tenth-ranked
Cheyney State by 41 points, one
would expect that the Lady Panther
basketball team would have had
problems with eight-h-ranked
Tennessee. 1

lt__seemed more probable when
sophmore tri-captain Jennifer Bruce
got her third foul within seven min-
utes of the game and only managed
to score four first-half points. Bruce
has been Pitt's, main scoring threat
all season, and with her on the
bench, one would expect things to be
even worse for the Lady Panthers.
However, even though the Lady
Panthers lost 73-60 to Tennessee
Friday night at the Fitzgerald Field
Hous_e, they proved something
important.

The near upset proved that the
Lady Panthers could stay with any
team in the«country—-even without
their major scoring threat.

. Swivmmersliurin‘In 

Jekyll I Hyde Act

By MARK A. ,S|NDLER

After the Panthers swimming ’

team dropped its seasonal mark to
2-2 and was given a West Virginia
beating of 66-47, coach Fred Lewis
was «ready to try out for a Dr.
Jekyll/Mr. Hyde role.

“Half the team swam really great
and the other half didn’t do so well,”
he said. “We had 20 season-best
swims, but it was a meet where we
only took advantage of some of the
breaks.” V

In those events that swimmers
belong in “the better half,” Jeff
Emore and Ed Bergan came in one-
two in the 200-backstroke. In his
best swim of the season, freshman

Don Martin swam the 200 individ-

ual medley in 1:57 and the 200 breast
stroke in 2:10. ‘
Even -in the final event, the 400
freestyle relay, Pitt swam competi-
tively with Ed‘ Bahan, Pete Doyle,
Jon Quinn and J.D. McCrillis, but it
wasn’t - enough—WVU already

4 peaked the 60-point mark.

“We were losing it going into (the
400),” Lewis remarked. “What hurt
us before that was that we weren’t
hitting the ﬂip turn in the50 free and
were staying under the water too

- long in the 100 free.

‘“Yeah, we planned to go down to
the last relay, but WVU already had
its 60 points; our guys even swam

"their season best . . . they gave a good
showing.” .

Another good showing for the
Panthers, if it was to be found at

‘Trees Pool Saturday, was the per-

formance of the divers.
. “As far as I'm concerned,” diving
coach Julian Krug stated, “we did
extremely well.” Krug noted that
WVU’s top two divers—Bill Treas-
urer and Steve Grindal—took the
top two placings in the one-meter
event, but only points ahead of
Krug’s prize diver, Mark
McCormick. .
McCormick placed third with 253

. points, behind Grindal’s 254.9 and
' Treasurer’s 271.7 points.

McCormick came back strong in
the ensuing. three-meter event; he
used a reverse two-and-a-half.som-
ersault in the pike position. “That’s
the dive that put him in first place,”
Krug said.

Krug also passed out a high grade
to his “unheralded freshman,” Todd
Mulzet. He took second off the
three-meter board, missing only one
dive all day. .

Considering the number of fresh-
men on his squad, Krug speaks as if
he were managing an all-senior
roster. 7

“We’re looking real good right

now,” he said. “We ought to help’

(the swimmers) from here on in.
You’d think that with all these
young people they would get stale,
tired and worn down.

“With us, though, this freshman
team keeps getting’ stronger. Yester-
day was our best meet ever with this
young a team. We're in super shape
getting ready for Easterns.”

The Panther track team’s venture
(to Friday night’s Millrose Games
and Saturday’s ‘_Mason-Dixon

Games was to bring them respect -»

and recognition.

Although Friday night was a dis-
aster, on Saturday, both the two-
mile relay team and Roger Kingdom
performed up to their capabilities.

The mystique of the Millrose
Games may have had something to

do with it, but it was an all around -

disappointment for the two-mile
relay team of Garland Brown, Terry

‘ Gallagher, Todd Colas and Darren

Geary that such high hopes going
into the evening’s competition.

“It was a race that everybody ran
bad. You have to feel bad because it
meant so much to us. Everyone has
that one bad day and it just so hap-
pened that the four of us had the bad
day simultaneously,” Colas  :d

back in the final period to down
Lehigh’s Dave Peterson 8-6.

At 1.58 lbs., Panther Jeff Jelic lost
to Doug Buckwalter 4-2 and then
hammered Lehigh’s Roy‘Lobdell 15-
0.

Eric Werti of Pitt gave up a 19-9

' loss to Pat Callahan of Lock Haven,

while Pitt forfeited the 167-lb.

weight class against Lehigh.

At-"177 1bs., Frank Rich gave up
two, first to’Lock Haven’s Joe Ryan
12-8, then to Jeff Turner of Lehigh
13-7.

concerning the race I that Ctlieiyi’ §j11*‘

believed, they could win.
Sophomore Roger Kingdom was
supposed to be Renaldo Nehemiah’s

alternate, but circumstances sur-j*‘

rounding the situation were‘ never;

finalized and as a result, the 60-‘ ‘

meter hurdles were decided without
either Kingdom or Nehemiah.
However, the Mason-Dixon

Games provided the ‘disheartened

Panthers with some performances
that could have wiped out the pre-

vious evening’s nightmare. The two- it
mile relay team breezed to victory in‘

a time of 7:30.2.

“We wanted to win this one, espe-
cially after Friday night. The pace
was pretty slow but that didn’t mat-
ter, just so we won,” Gallagher said.

ln the 60-meter hurdles, Kingdom
er:-': a school record (7.77) on his way
is a third place finish behind Ten-

nessee’s Willie Gault, who won with _

a time of 7.67.

on a short baseline jumper, Trent
Johnson called his number.

“I practiced that shot all week,”
Johnson said of the game winner. “I
-thought it was a good shot. I'll take
that shot anytime."

The man Pitt would usually go to
in that situation—Clyde Vaughan-
went the entire second half without
scoring a field goal. Vaughan sat out
longer in one stretch of the first half
than he has all year.

“I didn’t think he was in the {low ~

' of the game,” Chipman said. “We
were losing our poise, and Clyde
sometimes gets caught up in that and
puts even more pressure on himself.”

For only the third time this sea-
son,Vaughan did not lead the team
in scoring. He finished with 12 while
both Johnson and David had 14.

Pitt takes its next step Tuesday
when -it hosts St. John’s who will
come into the game ranked in the
Top 5 in the nation.

“This brings\u's into Tuesday on a
high,” ‘Chipman said. “Not that
anybody is going to be too
confident.”

The rejuvenated Panthers now are
looking for more than just a good
showing against St. John’s.

“The hell with coming close,” Cul-
bertson said. “We're not in this to
look good. We want to go to the
‘tourney.’ ”

That’s “tourney” as in the
NCAA’s that Culbertson’s referring

to there, and while most would scoff
at his confidence, Pitt will need that
kind of attitude against St. John’s
Tuesday.

: “They play real professional ball,”
Chipman said of.the Red Men.

“That’s why they can go up to Syra-
cuse and win in front’ of 30,000
people.”

St. John’s coach Lou Carnesecca
struggled to list his team’s weak-
nesses and finally admitted what few
coaches would—that he couldn’t
think of any.

His team is led by forwards David
Russell, Billy Goodwin and Chris
.Mullin.. Russell~nicknamed
‘skywalker’—stakes his claim down
inside while Mullin provides the out-
side shooting. A hot Mullin usually
means an unstoppable St. Johns.

Asked whether his team needs to
avoid the brand of basketball they
displayed earlier this year against
Villanova, Panther coach Roy Chip-
man sighed and said, “We need to
avoid another Villanova (game) the
rest of our lives.”

PANTHER NOTES: Johnson
matched his career-high rebounding

\mark of 15 set in last week’s loss at
Boston College....Williams scored

only one point but contributed with
five steals and a blocked shot that
sent the game into the second over-
time....Despite David’s perfor-
mance, Chipman will go with
George Allen in the starting unit
against St. John’s....Tuesday's game
will mark the half-way point of Pitt‘s
Big East schedule....The Panthers
will attempt to avenge their earlier
loss to Connecticut when they visit

the H uskies Saturday.

a sudden things didn’t work out the
way we wanted them to.”

For captain Barry Goldberg, it
was all a matter of concentration
and “being with it.”

“We could have done better,

t_here’s no doubt,” Goldberg said.
“But with Waterloo, for instance,
they started calling all these
timeouts and that messed up our
‘momentum. Our intensity was
gone.”

According to Petock, it was all

“They’re probably‘ used to playing
teams a lot bigger than us,"‘Petock
said of the Buckeyes. ‘‘In the begin-
ning it was all momentum; they
started taking us lightly. We jumped
on them with our hitting and passing
near perfect. It was the highlight of
our weekend.

“After that first game, we started -,

jumping up and down like we had
just won nationals,” he said. “We
were all so excited. Then (Ohio
State) came out 6-0 and we‘couldn’t

Waterloo, Reilly used his first-team
of Petock, Goldberg and Dave

Reilly also started Bill Rubosky
because he’s a “left-handed
attacker” and Tim Rakovan since
“the job came down to him and
Mike Keating. Rusbosky was play-
ing real well,” Petock said. “He
really made no mistakes and could
even pass for an experienced player.
He knows where he’s supposed to be

though he does have a little trouble
reading the hitters.”
