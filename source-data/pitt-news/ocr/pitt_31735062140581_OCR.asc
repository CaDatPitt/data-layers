'The Panther Has Taken

The Lead’-lCl1alrnley R

The Panther, campus undergrad-
uate publication, is the finest col-
, lege inaga-zineeinthe country; This

is the opinion of journalism au- ’
thorities of the Associated Col—.
legiate press, a cooperative organ- j

ization composed of more than 500

a college ‘and university publications. R

Mitchell Charnley, professor of
journalism at the University of
. Minnesota, and nationally known
magazine authority, singled out the
Panther for special distinction last

week at the Associated Collegiate _

press convention in St. Louis when
he termed it the most advanced stu-
dent magazine ever to come to his
attention. ‘During sessions’ of the

convention addressed by Professor

‘Charnley, the Panther was used to

illustrate effective treatment of.

campus photography, feature sto-
ries, and typography. ’

“The Panther has taken the lead
in giving substance to the under-
graduate magazine,” Professor
Charnley told the convention dele-
gates, ‘.‘lt has _completed a most
successful transition from the out-
moded, inconsequential joke maga-

zine to a publication that has a,

real purpose in being because “of
its interesting coverage of campus
events, lively pictorial layouts, and
effective page designs.”

Following the enthusiastic en-

. dorsement given to the Panther by
Professor Charnley, convention
delegates plied Edward Tait, BA42,
Panther ‘business manager, and

. 0lT'S.

Robert C. Machesney, adviser to

student publications at the Univer-
sity, with questions about the con-
tents and -mechanical requirements
of the magazine. Jack Stauﬂ’, C42,
editor of the Panther, did not. at
tend the convention. ‘

“It is gratifying that impartial
authorities have
ﬁne efforts of the Panther staff
this year in producing such an in-
teresting publication,” asserted Mr.

Machesney in commenting on the.
reception accorded the Panther in.

St. Louis. “Too often those of us
on the campus take our extra-cur-
ricular activities for granted, and it
requires an outside , viewpoint to
impress us with the effectiveness of
our program at Pitt.”

~ ‘-‘The "entire Panther staff has

given unsparingly of its time and,
, effort to create a better magazine,

and the recognition given the Pan-

«ther at the ACP convention is at

deserving reward for their endeav-

In addition to Tait and Mr. Ma-
chesney, Julian Silverman, BA42,
‘ business manager of the Pitt News;
John Brosky, C42, editor of the
1942 Owl; and Thomas Wester-
man, BA42, business manager of
the Owl, attended the meetings in
St. Louis. C

Mr. Machesney led a discussion

Defends PCW

From cover to cover, the issue
of the Panther today will have some
of the most potent and powerful

stuff that has ever come out of the T

eighth ﬂoor oﬂice. V
Even by itself, the article on

“Defending PCW” (as if they

didn’t have ﬁngernails) would suf-

fice to cause minor seismograph
recordings.

But in case there are a few who
haven’t heard of PCW, Jack Stand
and his crew take care of them by

* delving into their private lives with
picturesgof what brass rails they

A rest their feet on. .

Bill Benghausei*’s story “Coal

' Town” disposes of any left stand-
ing, with that gentle baseball bat

' touch. , . '

A lmitating Life style, there are
lots of pictures in this issue, pic-
tures of APD, budding fraternity;
pictures of demonstration block in
action; pictures of Pi Kappa Alpha
and their’ dinner guests, the Don“
Cossack Chorus; pictures of IF
banquet; and pictures of the Ford-
ham victory.

World State

“The present world turmoil is a phase in

“One has to do with the progressive ex-

tional American system of formal
classes in which the student’s work
is carefully doled out three times

of the teacher’s time and effort is
given to the mere checkingxup of

“The second problem concerns leadership.
Mechanisms for selecting the leaders in

“I am, not suggesting the aboli-
tion of the formal lecture or the
formal recitation. But the former
should generally be restricted to
really great lectures and the latter
to unskilled students in elementary
work. Nor should the University
undertake to cover the entire realm
of human knowledge through a
multiplicity of courses.

“From the administrative point
of view the formal courses which
are offered will be the stronger, the
more carefully their number is re-
stricted; from the student’s point
of view, the quality of his work
will be improved the more it results
from his own efforts.”

And Reverse Gear

By FRANK MASTORAKI
It's the easiest thing in the world

to become hot and bothered, and
splurge into a mess of oratory
about what is going to happen or
is not going to happen soon.

Quotes and‘ more quotes can
pollute a column, but, aside from
the writer, who ‘reads them? A
quote on a subject does not make
that position valid anyway.

A bunch of rah rah boys get hot
under certain conditions at certain
periods. We are in one of those
periods now. Guys like me just lap
up everything they have to -say.
I’m a hick anyway.

Progress, respect for life and de-
cency must cease, because‘ pretty
soon a whcle gang of fellows are
going to be thrown into battle with
only one aim-—to wipe Germany
off the map. Anybody that dis-
agree; with the politician’s or mili-
tarist’s tactics are going to get
plenty. A

Now you ain't an American if
I you s_ide with labor. Think what
conditions are going to be later on.

Take a brave fellow like York
for instance. He wanted to knock
the stufﬁngs out of the Germans
in the last war. But Woodrow Wil-
son with his idealistic dreams about
a League of Nations didn't permit
him. . _ “

Of course we must not think
about after we mow the Germans
_down. Things just follow natur-
ally, so the bar-leaning generals
say. *

Laborers will crawl. into silk
shirts, a chicken will ﬂoat in every
pot, and depression-—-along with
Germany —- will be eradicated

71.. Record sect

By Norman Marcus and Herb Reingold

Another Thanksgiving has arriv-
ed and with it our thanks go tothe
following: Thanks to Tommy Dor-
sey for those two super-perfect
records, “Violets for Your. Furs”
and “Somebody Loves Me” and an-
other record “I Think of You” and
“Who Can I Turn To”. These rec-
ords top our stack and they ought
to be foremost on your list of rec-
ord “musts.” ,

TD's consistency in turning out
the future hit songs of the (nation,
has always appeared to us as noth-
~ing short of amazing . . . More
turkey to Artie Shaw for such a
release as “Nocturne,” which
Shaw uses as his closing theme on
his current stage show tour, and
the ever popular Vincent Youman
fsong, “Through the Years."

We record collectors should be
thankful for Benny Goodman’s
switch from Columbia to Okeh. We
like that thirty-ﬁve cent bracket.
Don’t miss his ﬁrst release “Let’s
Do It” and “The Earl.”

A little more cranberries to Di-

nah Shore, the sweetheart of song, ~

for a swell-two-sided pop disk,
“This Is No Laughing Matter,”

medical school in the fall of'1942
will be given Friday, December 5,

Required for admission to medi-
cal school, the aptitude test will
not be given again for those plan-
ning to enter next fall. ‘

A”. fee. of $2 required for the spe-
cial test should be paid in advance
at the Bursar's office, 2409 Cathe-
dral, and the receipt preserved and
used as a card of admission to the

Copies of, the type of questions
used in the examination may be
examined in the College oﬁice, Mrs.
Gertrude C. Kummer, student ad-
viser in the College, said today.

MUSICAL COMMENTS:

One of the most beautifu theme

Leighton Noble’s “Midnight Moon.”
Noble’s band, who is playing the
FFF on December 5th, will be re-

Cwens Open Sale

  Of Directories

Over 700 student directories were
sold the ﬁrst day of the campaign
last Thursday, to establish a record
for that day and to begin what
may be a record for the total sale
of directories.

The sales campaign will end to-
day, according to Ruth Rosen-
bloom, C44, chairman of the ser-
vice committee of Cwens, publish-
er of the directories. Cwen sales-
women may be identiﬁed by gray
and red ribbon bows.

Students who have not purchas-
ed one of the 1,500 directories or-
dered and still want one may get
it in the oﬂice of the dean of wom-
en on the twelfth ﬂoor, stated
Ruth Rosenbloom, C, chairman of
the service committee.

Containing the names, address-
es, and telephone numbers of all
studentscarrying 12 or more cred-
its in all undergraduate schools
the directories were edited by
Betty Jane Weddle, C; Martha Bo-
lar, C; Nancy Hardy, C; Betty
McMahan, C; Marion Swope, C, all
members of Miss Rosenbloom’s
committee.

Don’t tell anybody, but Ben Ber-

nie and all his boys are going to be
at the old Stanley The-atre come
this Friday.
I The ol’ ol’ ol’ maestro with the
stuffed nose ‘and the ruffed hose
can beat it out with the best of
the jive bands from here to St.
Agnes Street in San Francisco.

Which reminds us of an experi-

-ence We once had out on the West

coast “so dad-gummed hungry we

“ almost croaked.” We were walking

down Shade toward the waterfront
when we were accosted by an elder-

ly gent carrying a left handed
‘ trombone under his right arm, or

rather under where his right arm
should have been. ,
c He said, “Where ya’goin’mug,”
in the inimitable. West coast
brogue.

We said, “None of your busi-

ness,’ you broken down roulette

player.”
gwhereupon he slunk away down
St. Agnes Street, which intersects
Shade at a ninety-two degree an-
gle. *

Ever since then we have never
been able to forget that Ben Bernie
was on the radio for years. Liter-
ally years.

Anybody who would miss seeing
and hearing the ol’ ol’ ol’ maestro
and his boys is a ‘traitor to radio
and the cinema and entertainment
in general. '

The show on the screen is called
New York Town, which we sup-
pose is called that so that it would
not be confused with New York

City which is a suburb of Brook- ,.

lyn.

Fred MacMurray, good, old,
faithful, happy, merry, gentle,
comic, cosmic Fred MacMurray,
and Mary Martin, dear, young, un-
faithful, sad eyed, sloe eyed, blue
eyed, black and blue eyed Mary
Martin are in the picture.

It’s much too early in the week
to predict what the picture will be,
but we hazard the guess that it
has something to do with New
York and love. Moving pictures al-
ways do.

Dr. Ferguson, Athlete, Author, Navy
Man, Coal Itleaver, Calls Life Humble

Editor’s Note: Following is the first
in a series of articles dealing" with the
backgrormds, activities, and personali-
ties-of University faculty members.
By HARRIET BAUER

f‘Come in, come in,” is the usual
friendly grcel:i:n«,r of Dr. Russell J.
Ferguson, associate pro.i:'csso1‘ of
History, when a student hesitates
0111: the threshold of his oflice. That
welcome is one 1-easonvgghy stu-
dents fail to think of Dr. Fergriison
asra strict, distant professor; an-
other reason is the backgrouncl of
the man himself.

:What he modestly calls a hum-
ble life was begun on a farm in El-
wood, Indiana. Dr. Ferguson at-
tended Indiana university, but in-
terrupted his college career to
teach in a rural school. In 1921,
however, he received his AB from
Indiana.

A year in the navy as a fireman

or “coal heaver” as he calls it was
one of the most colorful phases of

I his life. He ‘enlisted in tlye navy

and sailed aboard the  Kear-
sarge in the second division of the
Atlantic ﬂeet. During his service
the,_ battleship sighted two I Ger-
man submarines which xvercfsunk
by {the .Kearsar,2,‘e. On one sub-
ma1'inc~. a direct hit was scored.
They‘ were not certain that the sec-
ondhad been destroyed until the
next imorning when oil appeared
on the water. .

Athletics have not been over-
looked in Dr. Ferguson’s career.
In the years 1921 to 1923 he was
director and athletic coach at Han-
over, Indiana. From 1923 to 1925
he was assistant coach in football
and basketball at Indiana univer-
sity, and at the same time he was
doing graduate work at that Uni-
versity.

Since 192-?» Dr. l,*‘e.rguson has
been at Pitt except. in 1927 when
he went to lndiana university once
more. After a year he returned
with his doctor’s degree.

_As a research associatc he work-
ed, in 1.9535, with the Western Pann-
sylvania Historical survey.

For several years Dr. Ferguson
has been looking for old docu-
ments and has found 60,000 manu-
scripts. In his search he has dis-
covered old letters and sketches
which include Colonel Burd's or-
iginal sketch of Fort Loyal Han-

nah. Letters from some of the most
famous men in American history
have been found by Dr. Ferguson.
At Meadeville he found letters
from Washington, John Quincy
Adams, Monroe, Madison, Jackson,
Calhoun, Clay, and Franklin.

The most interesting of those
letters, in Dr. l<‘erg'uson’s opinion,
is one written in 1776 to General
Mifflin by Elbridgc Gerry. The
letter was written two or three
days after the battle of Long
Island. Gerry was present at the
battle, and expressed in the mas-
sage great disappointment and
concern over the dire, position in
which it placed them.

A letter, also in Dr. Ferg‘uson’s
possession, from Benjamin Frank-

Carlson Gives Advice
For Vacation Recess

“Don”r. work over Thanl<sgi\‘ing
vacation” is the latest advice from
Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of the
Student Health B111. the
Doc, a ‘f'1;-iend in need, gets to the
core of the matter when he recom-
mends, “Professors should not as-
sign make-up work over the holi-
days.”

Dr. Carlson’s technical explan-
ation for these bits of wisdom,
“Tlia11ksgiving recess is a much-
needed recovery period after the
first lap of school,” may be sum-

Tech, 15 Blue and Gold clad players will walk back

for the last time, as members of a Pitt eleven. They

» R We reprint the following article that appeared last Sat-

1: Nagelbnrg. We have nothing to say. Om’ “Special Delivery”
wa.sn’t mailed, and our line was thinldng of the Fordham
Jgame. Penn State’s students should well be proud of .Petrello,

Following  the Grrlrlen Pcmther"s obitmiry:

Mr. Alex Zelenski
Sports Editor

V, Pitt News

3?; Dear Alex:

 Sorry, but I have some bad news for you. State is going
 to beat the hell out of those Panthers of yours this afternoon.
 You’ll probably be surprised to see me use such strong lan-
guage but that isn't half as positive as our team feels.

We’re pretty tired around these parts of hearing about

the jinx Pitt has over us and how our boys fold up whenever
they step into Pitt Stadium. Football games are won on ability
and ﬁght and believe me, our boys have such an overabun-
dance of both, they could give some to those aroused Pan-
thers, as you call them, and still have plenty to spare.

What’s more, there’re a bunch of sophomores in the State
line who can’t wait till they get their hands on “Special De-
livery” Jones. He’s a darn good half back, but these young-
sters are no slouches themselves and are in dead earnest in
"sending “Special Delivery” back to the dead letter depart-
*ment.

I remember last year's game, the lost bowl dream, and
it still hurts whenever I think of what might have been. There
are two other boys who felt even worse just a year ago. They're
Len Krouse and Bill Smaltz. Have you ever heard of them?

Your Jones has to wait till he intercepts a pass before he
can deliver and it will be a clear day in Smokey City before

- he can break up the best pass combination in the East. As a
it  pitcher, Smaltz ﬁnds the home plate like Lefty Grove. Our
.=4I '1 Captain Krouse has a patented pair of mitts, guaranteed to

 

 

 

hold on to anything thrown within ten yards of him. And_

something tells me, those two are going to be supercharged
this afternoon.

That isn't all we have in store for your team, Alex. We
have a few backs of our own who can deliver the mail and
while Petrella, Debler, Banbury, Smaltz and Krouse don't have
any special tags appended to their names, they usually get
there in the end.

We have another game left aftentoday, with South Caro-
lina, but for all purposes, the Pitt game is the end for our
boys. They’ve been talking about it all season and they’ll be
ready this afternoon.

\ See you after the game to collect that little wager of ours.
‘And thanks for the offer but I won’t need any points or odds-
Even money is good enough for me. "

ll ' S » Sincerely yours,
   Ma"

Pat.

the scenes. It’s true that with the

style of play this year.
Though Fife and Jones deﬁnite-
recently innovated free substitu-
tion rule, the duties of the quar-

ly deserved every bit of praise sent
their way for Fordham perform-

has been silently potent offensive-
ly, and a “Rock
of Gibralter" on
the defense.

He is one of
the cleanest de- = :
fensive men on ~ -
the gridiron, but
when he hits
them, they feel it.
The Panther sig-

_ nal-caller receiv-
‘’ A ed very little _..
i — publicity for his -

It wasn’t until an injury almost
prevented West's playing last Sat-
urday, that the “taken for grant-
ed” quarterback’s importance was
realized.

He isn't likely to get any All-
American ratings, but his all-’
round consistency deﬁnitely earns
Walt West, Sports Man of the
Week ratings.

With another year to go, though,
West should be rated pretty near
the top of any all-star ratings, be-
fore‘ he trades his’. pigskin for the

    

“The Mailman” personally delivered both of
Pitt’s victories this year, and will probably be out to
really deliver the goods in his swan song against
'l‘ecb on Saturday.

Team captain Ralph Fife, who for three years has
performed in all-American style at guard for the
Panthers also comes in for his share of glory as he
closes his college career. Fife, playing on the line
where a player's worth is usually underrated, is one
of the best guards to ever have playedat Pitt.

Gervelis, Kindleberger, Benghauser, in fact all of
the boys who will be saying adieu to football at Pitt,
have performed nobly whenever called upon. Coach
Charlie Bowser will have a hard time ﬁlling a lot
of the posts left vacant by these players.

As they trot off the field on Saturday their job
will have been completed, but every one of them
will be sorry to write finis to their playing days at
Pitt. All of our good wishes for the future goes to

Pitt’s battle-scarred football
team will bring their 1941 gridiron
campaign to a close next Saturday
afternoon when they play host to
the Carnegie Tech Tartans in the
traditional turkey series.

Although no Eastern champion-
ship or even a city title is at stake
when these two rivals meet, a typ-
ical “give and take" battle is an-
ticipated.

Carnegie’s Skibos are at the end
of one of their worst records in
.modern history, and the Panthers
should also be glad when the cur-
rent season is all over. Regardless
of the unimpressive marks that
these two football aggregations
have rung up, a crowd of near-20¢
000 is expected to be on hand.

The once-ﬁghting, once-feared
Skibo has slipped to a mere walk.
They do not have any of the great
material that once guided them to
the Sugar Bowl, and a couple of
Eastern championships.

Pitt, on the other side of the H01-
low, is not quite in such a ﬁx. They
have not slipped to a mere walk,
although, critics at times, seem to
think so. The Panthers have been
meeting the cream of the football
crop, Saturday after Saturday,
and, unfortunately, their record
shows it. '

In the opening game of the sea-
son, Carnegie students did not
know what to expect. Of course,
they knew that Couch Eddie Ba-
ker had a great deal of trouble
getting two full teams out for
spring drills, and that only three
teams reported for fall practice.
But they felt things won't be too
bad for only Notre Dame and Pitt
offer any kind of opposition.

The season started, and West-
minster won the inaugural, 19-13.
A little fellow by the name of Vir-
gil Cantini threw a lot of passes,
and, to the amazement of the
crowd, completed the majority of
them.

It was all Cantini in the follow-

. inggame for he led his teammates

to a 14-0 victory over Albright.
The fans didn’t know it at the time

Panthers Meet Tech Tartans
In Season Finale Saturday

but that was to be the only Tartan
victory of the season, that is, thus
far this season.

Diminutive “Virgy" Cantini was
hurt in the next encounter and his
teammates lost to Muhlenburg,
26-0. '

Things looked dark at this
point for Notre Dame was their
next opponent, but they failed to
realize that the Irish mentor was a
kindly soul and refused to run up
scores. The Irish didn’t because
they used third and fourth strings
through the entire contest, and
were content to leave Pittsburgh
with a mere 16-0 victory.

Geneva, Case, and Cincinnati
took verdicts over the Tartans in
the next thre games, and the grid-

ders had a. three week rest before-

the Panther game.

During this time, they scouted
and rescouted the Panthers hoping
to see something that would help
them defeat their hated rivals.
Maybe they have and maybe not
for time will only tell, but regard-
less, Tech always plays over their
heads against Pitt, and this year
it will be no different.

Carnegie Tech has only three
better than average football play-
ers, Pash, Anderson, and Holets.
These boys have held the team to-
gether all season, and should be
standout performers against Pitt
this Saturday.

Edgar “Special Delivery" Jones
will be out to compensate for his
unmailed performance of last
week. It will be the last game of
his college career, and with the aid
of a few front runners, should
‘have a ﬁeld day at the expense of
the hapless Tartans.

The local warriors will undoubt-

“All good things must come to

ly to a superior. Mr. Umble
REALLY knows his football.

Bob Machesney, adviser to stu-
dent publications, and Frank Car-
ver, athletic publicity director, di-
vide third place honors. Since the
Pitt News can’t afford to pass out
more awards, Machesney and Car-
ver must be content with respective
fractional chunks of the third place
pie. But will they like raspberry?

Robert Arthur, Ralph Mitterling,
Ben Grady, and Carl Olson ﬁnished
in that order. Arthur, director of
Pitt’s super band, makes music . . .
but good. Arthur, director of Pitt’s
super band, makes with the predic-
tions . . . but otherwise.

And Mitterling is a great base-

 ball coach. At winning diamond
battles, he's right on top. But as a ,

gridiron clairvoyant, he's certain-
ly a ﬂop.

Ben Grady, Pitt’s favorite swim-
ming coach, was a great diver dur-
ing his collegiate days. Though he
started the season as one of the

, faculty's most able coin tossing

Predicters, Grady forgot that his
undergraduate days were ﬁnished
and took one of the greatest dives
of his career. And if it weren’t for
the ever obliging Mr. Olson, Grady
would have hit the bottom on this
one.

Everyone is convinced that the
track coach is anti-social. At the
outset of the season, he took pos-
session of the cellar slot, and hasn't
permitted anyone to even threaten
his perverted supremacy.

But it’s been a great campaign,
not only for the contestants but
for the sports editor. Every Fri-
day of the grid season, Zelenski
was assured of ﬁfteen inches of
the least informative space ﬁller,
ever to appear in any publication.

Dougan, Arthur, Fishburn
Try Combined Band Stunt

The successful attempt on Sat-
urday to combine the bands of two
colleges in one spectacular half-
time demonstration was worked
out by Lieutenant R. C. Dougan,
assistant professor of military sci-
ence and tactics, and Robert L.
Arthur, director of Pitt Band, and
Hummel Fishburn, director of the
Blue band of Penn State.

Lt. Dougan and Arthur went
to State several weeks ago to see
Fishburn who agreed to try the
stunt which had never been at-
tempted by either school before.

Pitt blueprints of formations
were sent to State and it was ar-
ranged that the Blue band would
arrive in Pittsburgh in time to re-
hearse at 10 o'clock Saturday
morning.

“On Saturday morning up at the
ﬁeld,” Arthur said later, “you
wouldn't have know that they were

two different colleges, much less
competing ones. They all worked
as one unit.”

Ohio State and Northwestern
have been the only other schools
that Arthur has seen use the dou-
ble formation.

The fact that Pitt and Penn
State have a similar set-up for
band members to reach positions
in formations is the reason that
this type of demonstration has not
been attempted before with other
schools.

Where some colleges have band
men run or walk by the shortest
routes to their positions, the Blue
band and Pitt’s band use the mili-
tary column right system.

More favorable comments have
been received, Arthur said, on last
Saturday's formation from both
Pittsburghers and Penn Staters
than have ever been received for
any formation.

Monday afternoon. The victory
put the Punks a step closer to their
third intramural championship in
as many years.

As in all their games this sea-
son it didn't take the Punks long
to start rolling. After kicking oﬂ
to the Phi Eps, they took posses-
sion as the los-
ers p u n t e d on
f o u r t h down.
Again it was lef-
__ ty Eddie Ziol-
: kowski w h o
' started to bom-
bard the opposi-
tion with passes,
and when Larry
Paffrath caught
one in the end
zone, the score
was 6-0. Ziol tried to run the con-
version over, but was stopped at
the goal line.

Johnny Swacus was the next

player to catch one of all-1ntra-
mural Ziolkowski’s passes and
send the score to 12-0. Artman
juggled the conversion pass and
ﬁnally dropped it, as the Punks
got ready to start another drive.

The Phi Ep attack which was
throttled throughout the game,
bogged down again after the kick-
off, and they were again forced to
punt. This time Dutch got off a
poor kick, which went out of
bounds after going only a few
yards, and the Punks took over
again.

The Ziolkowski to Peﬂrath com-
bine clicked again on the first play
that followed, and the score rose
to 12-0, which was augmented a
moment later, when Ziol person-
ally ran the conversion over.

The second half found the mon-
otony continuing for Palfrath scor-
ed the next Punk touchdown ‘and
conversion on aerials from Ziol.

Midway in the half Ziolkowski

pulled the nicest play seen on the
Trees ﬁeld all year. With the ball

_ Eddie Baker, head coach at Car-
negie Tech spent last Saturday in
the Stadium press box scouting the

Panthers for this week's contest
between Pitt and Tech. In addition
to this purely professional duty,
however, it would not be amiss to
suggest that Mr. Baker indulged
in a bit of rooting for Pitt, which,
after all, is his own Alma Mater.

Baker entered the University of
Pittsburgh in 1927 after his gradu-
ation from something called Nan-
ticoke High School, a fact that
was never held against him. He im-
mediately distinguished himielf in
two ﬁelds, athletics and scholar-
ship. An honor student, Baker was
tapped to ODK in his senior year.

Baker is often referred to as a
natural born athlete. He was not
merely good but outstanding in
football, baseball, and basketball.
When he joined the varsity foot-
ball squad in 1928 Baker played
center, but he was soon shifted to
quarterback.

It has often been charged though
never proven that the change was
personally engineered by Baker.
lt seems that Baker never wanted
to play center, and though he was
good in everything else his passes
bore more resemblance to some-
thing seen on a basketball court
than on a gridiron. ln 1929 he
was first string quarterback. By
1930 he not only played at quar-
terback but also alternated at left
half in addition to being captain of
the squad.

This was the year that he was
selected quarterback on the All-
East team playing in the annual
East-West contest in San Francis-
co. It would be nice to be able to
add here that he won the game
singlehanded, but, alas, it seems

As If This Old Pitt Grad
Needed An Introduction

that his sole cause for fame was in
a negative sort of way. He drop-
ped a punt which was immediately
pounced upon by the opposition and
converted into a touchdown.

He was co-captain of the bas-
ketball team in his senior year.
Baker played on the team that fen-
tured Charley Hyatt, considered
one of the finest of all basketball
players, a fact that was to Baker's
disadvantage for his own brilliant
play was constantly overshadowed
by the work of Hyatt.

He joined the coaching staff of
the University of Pittsburgh in
1931. From 1934 to 1936 he was
backﬁeld coach under Jock Suth-
erland who considered him one of
the smartest men in football.

In 1937 Baker went to Carnegie
Tech as assistant to Bill Kern, and
at the end of the 1939 season he in-
herited the head coaching job and
the headaches of coaching this de-
ﬂated, deemphasized team. At this
point it seems far more merciful to
ignore the Tartan record. It is suf-
ﬁcient to say that Baker has done
a masterful job with the material
or rather lack of it that has been at
hand.

He is said to be the most popu-
lar coach Tech has ever had which
is really something for a fellow
whose team loses with such alarm-
ing consistency.

But Baker has yet another source
of fame. His prowess as a poker
player has earned him the title
“Iron Vest.” An “Iron Vest,” it
seems, is a person who takes all
the money in while permitting
little to get out.

But it is a cinch that Baker
would gladly sacriﬁce all his poker
winnings for just one football win
-—preferably the game against Pitt
on Saturday.

in midﬁeld, he faded back to pass,
but the Phi Ep line broke through
and rushed him. Taking I page
from the book of Edgar Jones, Ziol
raced toward the far sideline, re-
versed his ﬁeld entirely, and ran
through the entire Phi Ep team
to score. His momentum carried

him through the gate at the end -

of the field and halfway up the
hill towards the street above. The
conversion was not good, but the
game was now out of the Phi Eps
reach, and a few minutes later the
ﬁnal whistle blew.

Even though they were beaten
and were beaten badly, credit must
be given to the Phi Eps, who never
stopped trying as they fought
valiently to cross the Punks goal
line at least once.

For one brief moment it looked
as though they had accomplished
what no other team had done this
season, as one of Dutch's passes
found its mark to a man standing
over the goal line. The play was
called back for Dutch had been
downed before he let go of the
ball.

Even this didn’t stop the Phi.
Eps from trying as they fought
to get the ball again, and try once
more to push it over. However,
power, coordination, and ZIOL-
KOWSKI were too much for them,
and they found themselves on thl‘
short end of the 32-0 score.

Semi-Pro Clubs
Battle Cagcrs

ln Practice Tilt:   i

Less than a month from tonight
Pitt’s varsity basketball team
opens its 1941 season against
Northwestern, and from the looks
of things right now, this should be
one of the best years in Pitt court
history.

Dr. H. Clifford Carlson, head
basketball mentor, waxes enthusi-
astic ‘every year about this time,-
but this year his enthusiasm seems
to have some foundation as the
team has looked very good in the
practice session held thus far.

Up to now they have engaged in
two warmup engagements with 10-
cal semi—pro teams, and have easily
won both of these. The main pur-
pose of these games is to point out
possible ﬂaws the players may
have, but still the boys like to win
them,/and it does help the team
psychologically.

One of the surprises of the prac-
tices has been the showing of lit-
tle Bobby Artman, who looks like
he'll really go places this year.
He's playing in the starting five at
present and looks very good.

If co-captain Eddie Ziolkowski
isn’t pulled out by the draft, the
smooth working stating ﬁve should
prove plenty troublesome to Pitt’s
opponents this year. However, if
he can't ﬁnish the season, it will
leave a big hole that will be hard
to ﬁll.
