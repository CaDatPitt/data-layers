PH! finds cancer-killing protein

By Christopher Lawrence
Staff Writer

The problem with cancer cells, unlike normal cells, is that they are
imbalanced. They undergo too much growth and too little death,
which is why cancer cells accumulate. ,

A research team at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute
(UPCI) believes it may have discovered an answer to this problem.

It’s a protein which may induce programmed cell death in cancer
cells. . ‘

The principal investigator for the research is Q. Ping Dou, assistant
professor of pharmacology at Pitt.

According to Dou, the number of cells in the body are regulated by
a balance between proliferation, growth arrest and apoptosis, or pro-
grammed cell death.

Previously, scientists discovered p53, a tumor-suppressing protein
that prevents cancer cell growth by triggering apoptosis. However,
most kinds of cancer have dysfunctional or missing p53 genes and
therefore cannot be cured through the p53-dependent pathway.

Dou’s research, which appears in the Sept. 26 issue of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, involves a new bio-

nobody knew the major player involved,” Dou said. “We found a
good candidate for that player." .

The researchers discovered that specific inhibitors of the protein
phosphatase prevented the apoptosis induced by proven anti—cancer
drugs. This suggested to Dou that the “major player” he was looking
for was phosphatase.

Dou has spent most of his career studying the proteins involved in
cancer. He came to the United States from his native China in 1983
to pursue a Ph.D. in Chemistry at Rutgers University. Upon receiving
his doctorate in 1989, Dou moved on to Harvard Medical School,

I where he worked at the Dana—Farber Cancer Institute.

Dou was studying the proteins that controlled normal cell growth
but were deregulated in cancers when_he was recruited by Pitt’s
Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine and the UPCI in
1993.

Once at Pitt, Dou began to focus on the problem of limited cell
death associated with cancer. .

“I wanted to first discover the protein that is responsible for the
apoptosis induced by anti—cancer drugs. Then we could purify the
protein, clone the gene and deliver it into cancer cells to kill them,”
Dou said.

Pro-life student describes his philosophy

By Stephanie Ellsworth
Staff Writer

Booker Stallworth gives the phrase
“never a dull moment” new meaning.

The 19-year-old political science
major is actively involved in more than
five campus organizations yet still finds
time to enjoy his college experience.

Stallworth, a junior, currently serves

as president of the Intercollegiate

Federation for Life, vice-president of
College Republicans, business manager
for the Panther Investment Club, mem-
ber of Pitt Students for Life and publish-
er of The Phoenix, a conservative publi-
cation compiled by Pitt and Carnegie
Mellon students.

Stallworth, a staunch Republican who
says he considers his political philoso-
phy to be “Christian Libertarian,”
believing in Christian values and free
will, is also an avid pro-lifer.

He said he‘was first introduced to

I organized pro-life advocacy after talk-

\

ing to a member of Pitt Students for Life
when he was a senior at nearby
Woodland Hills High School.

Stallworth, of Forest Hills-, said he
was in downtown Pittsburgh waiting for
a bus when Joel Garrett gave him pro-
life literature.

“Though I’d always been opposed to
abortion, I didn’t really think about the
whole issue that much until I talked to
[Garrett],” he said. He said his attitude
was also influenced by how he was
raised.

But Stallworth also had a personal
reason for his position, even before

“being introduced to organized pro-life

activity.

“I had a really close friend who had an
abortion,” he said. Stallworth’s friend
suffered physical and emotional devas-
tation and is now unable to have chil-
dren.

“That really brought it home,” he said.
“I just really saw how ugly abortion
was.”

When he first came to Pitt, he wanted
to be active with pro-life organizations.
In fact, as a freshman, Stallworth had a
weekly column in The Pitt News called
“By the Book.” In addition to the col-
umn, he hosted a conservative news
show by the same title on WPTS, Pitt’s
radio station.

But the first thing Stallworth got
involved in at Pitt was not politically
oriented. He played on the rugby team
during his freshman year and for part of
his sophomore year.

Now, Stallworth said, he is taking

some time off from it because he is so I

busy. “I’m probably going to go back to
[playing rugby], though,” he said. “It’s a
great game.”

Right now he is focusing his attention
on other things, he said. As publisher of
The Phoenix for the past two years.
Stallworth assumes a great deal of
responsibility.

The central banks of

Cdicross the Nation,

TOPEKA, Kan. — When
the federal government
compelled states to drop

speed limits to 55 mph in
1974, for Kansas, with its
limits of 75 mph on inter-
states and 80 mph on the
state’s turnpike, it was like
jumping on the brakes.

But now, with the lifting
of federal restraints on
speed limits Tuesday by
Congress and President
Clinton, Kansas will likely
join Nevada, South Dakota
and Wyoming in restoring a
75 or 70 mph limit.

Advocates of the higher
limits say that in 1995,

to talkto your doctor.

 

Every 45 seconds in this country, someone is sexually assaulted — over half a million women
and children a year. The American Medical Association wants this nightmare to end.

Dr. Lonnie Bristow, the President of the AMA, believes that “victims are scared into silence
by a mistaken sense of shame.” The truth must be heard. The AMA has identified sexual
assault as the Silent Violent Epidemic. And to help deal with this brutal crime, new
treatment guidelines have been made available to physicians nationwide. They can help
with the physical and emotional trauma.

If you’ve felt up to now that there was no one you could trust. No one who would believe
you. lt’s time to break the silence. The AMA wants you to know you can talk to your doctor.
Don’t ever be afraid to tell.

Recently, The Phoenix, in
conjunction with the univer-
sity’s law school, sponsored
a debate between Catharine
MacKinnon and Nat Hentoff
regarding cyberporn, he said.

“[The Phoenix ] is for free

Stallworth said. People on
both sides of every issue are

He believes too many col-
lege students often possess a
“‘60s mentality.”

“There are conservative
students who care about lib-

ty of human life,” he said.
“We’re not just off protest-

His eventual goal is to own

Both the p53-dependent and
the p532-independent pathways
are triggered by chemotherapy
drugs that damage the DNA
inside cells. This damage starts a
sequence of intracellular events
that lead to programmed cell
death. Near the end of the
sequence, a protein called pRB
accumulates and causes cells to
stop dividing.

According to Dou, the indepen-
dent pathway is a more direct
way to cause the pRB to accumu-
late. The growth arrest resulting
from the accumulation is.some-

times followed by apoptosis.

When the phosphatase protein
is introduced, the arrest of cell
division is always followed by
cell death, Dou said. In the
dependent pathway, the arrest
does not always lead to apoptosis.

The research is progressing, but
it’s still in the early stages. The
protein must be reﬁned and puri-
fied before the gene can be
cloned and used on cancer cells.

“Hopefully, when we are
done,” Dou said, “we will have a
genethatcan kill all major can-
cers —— including those that are
resistant to multiple anti—cancer
drugs.”

Opinions
Police Power

Two months ago a black motorist in Overbrook, Jonny
Gammage, died while in the custody of five white police offi-
cers.

Last week, Pittsburgh Steeler wide receiver Johnnie Barnes
was pulled over by a white officer who said his physical
description and car matched a suspect the police were looking
for.

Even without these two incidents, anyone who has looked out-
side his window the past year realizes there is a growing prob-
lem in our society involving police officers and suspects.

Too often in situations like these, hotter heads prevail over
cooler ones, like the riots in Los Angeles after the first trial of
the four officers accused of beating motorist Rodney King.

The Pittsburgh Chapter of the NAACP, led by Tim Stevens, is
on the right track toward getting past the rhetoric that has been
tossed about recently.

Instead of fussing over what could have or should have hap-
pened, the NAACP is looking to the future and will try to edu-
cate everyone in the area, especially children, on police aware-
ness. (Pittsburgh Tribune Review) - ,

Education is the best prescription to prevent another incident

_like the Gainmage one. Citizens of every -local community like

Overbrook need to know what rights they have and what kind of
power the police have. ‘

The NAACP is considering releasing the dos and don'ts for
all citizens when pulled over or when dealing with confronta-
tional situations with police officers. Some suggestions are:
reamin cool and collected, control body language and keep your
hands the wheel.

Recognize Dr. Needleman

Over four decades of medical research assisting families and
their children has finally gotten Pitt professor Herbert
Needleman some national recognition. '

His Lead Exposure Study, which he has worked on since the
1950s, forced the federal government to ban lead from gasoline,
paint and food and beverage cans. ,

And last Thursday, at a ceremony in the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C., Needleman was one of five individuals to
receive a $250,000 Heinz Award.

Needleman’s award, the first Heinz ever given to a
Pittsburgher, was in the Environmental category. His research

I led to the discovery of poisonous lead in such common places as

a can of vegetables or in the walls of homes across the country.
At a time when Pitt’s administration can’t seem to shake its

negative public image, it’s refreshing to see someone like

Needleman rise above the nonsense and bring something posi-

_ tive back to Pitt.

Fellow intrepid explorer,
diehard conservationist, and
noble Pitt News _ patron, let me
welcome you to Dan’s
Interactive Safari, sponsored by
Negative Editorials, Inc. We are
embarking on an epic journey
unprecedented in the storied
history of journalism: a daring
trek through the heart of one of
the earth’s most unchartered
territories, the rainforest!

Sometime later:....

Look out! Whew, that was a
close one. That anaconda near-
ly crawled right up your pant
leg! We are walking into the
inner depths of an old-growth
forest in the Amazon region of
Brazil. Our small but fearless
band of adventurers trek
amongst the most untamed
wildlife and untreated plant
life, courageously defying the
innumerable perils allied
against us in this uncivilized,
foreign world.

Venturing further into the
heart of this wondrous rainfor-
est, we gaze up in awe at the
majestic beauty of our sur-
roundings, dodging falling dew
drops and monkey droppings.
Three—thousand-year-old Sitka
spruce, in which the monkeys
play, ascend above us in a pro-
tective canopy shielding out the
sunshine of which we so desire.
From this canopy comes an
unremitting chorus of birds —
Woody Woodpecker, Toucan
Sam, Woodstock — all of
whose colorful cheeps and
chirps reverberate throughout
this animated forest.

Forging ahead in nearly
unnavigable dense brush, we
are momentarily halted by an
enormous tree stump some 20
feet in diameter protruding into
our makeshift path. As expert
oiienteers, we decide to change
course entirely by walking
around the fallen Sitka, rather
than risk falling prey to the pur-
ple people-eater termites feed-
ing on the juicy decomposed
bark. We walk alongside the
250-foot-long tree until we are

bling stream. Thirstily, I and a
few other members of our trek
drink, paranoid, of the cool,
refreshing, uncontaminated
water, wary of hungry piranhas
which threaten to blunt our
noses. Fatigued, we set up
camp on the banks of the
stream, careful not to attract the
attention of the hippos or croc-

odiles wading downstream. '

Under the warm light of our

teepee campfire, we reenact "

events which have so far high-
lighted our adventure — from
the over-curious monkey to our
harrowing encounter with the
purple people-eater termites, a
predatory carnivorous insect
yet undocumented in scientific
classification charts. Relaxing
in our contemplative states of
Zen meditation, all of us
breathe in deeply of the unpol-
luted, crisp autumn air; regard-
ing the dim shadows of the
greenery and wildlife encom-
passing us and dozing off into a
restful slumber.

Suddenly we are awakened
by possibly a jaguar, possibly a
monster, darting up into a near-
by tree. Startled by this foreign
noise, we hastily pack up camp
and expeditiously make a
retreat from the Thing’s turf.

Travelling as fast we can in our

sleepy, dazed and confused
state, we cut through the forest
in a disorientated, misdirected
panic, wary of the monster that
lurks amongst us. Heading fur-
ther and further off non-existent
trails, we reach a clearing and
decide to reset camp and return
to sleep under the watchful
eyes of the stealthy, predatory
beasts which stalk us in the
night. I

We awake with the rising
sun, sleepy from uneasy, rest-
less slumber. All of us set out
to perform the morning ritual of
scouring the land for ﬁrewood.
But here, here in what appears

as a vast and desolate expanse,
we will find no firewood. In
stark contrast to the dense,
vivacious forest which we left
behind, here where we stand lie
only the blistered stumps of
what was once an animate,
healthy ecosystem. We are pet-
rified in disbelief. Off in the
distance, we can hear the chain-
saws, see the charred devasta-
tion, and smell the acrid stench
of burned vitality. In a way,
some of us feel though we our-
selves are in those flames,
burning too. There in the dis-
tance is an inferno —— consum-
ing the environment, consum-
ing the life and heritage of our
race, our wildlife, and our plan-
Ct.

Extending into the horizon
we see a panoramic picture of
mass deforestation. A 3000-
year—old miracle of nature is
being effortlessly destroyed at
nearly an acre per second. Our
group falls into a concerned
discussion, cogitating as to the
mindlessness of such waste.

We pose questions: who will
conquer these heartless powers
scorching the vital organs of
our planet with raging winds of
fire? Who will rebel against
such spiteful maliciousness and
plant seeds to revive and
reclaim our fallen rainforests?
Who can rise above the politics
and economies which we
humans have imposed upon
ourselves, in an effort to save
our burning planet from dying
of wounds inflicted by our

‘ species?

Woeful, we all bow our head
downward in humbled respect
for the fallen forest. At the
same time, a few of us take
notice of a small patch of
unscathed, minute trees: if they
should die, the fate of this
ancient growth forest is sealed.
If they should live, the pristine
splendor of this intenninable.
barren expanse may once again
ﬂourish.

he Pitt men’s basketball
team is mired in a
catch-22.

It has five talented and high-
ly touted freshman. The better
they play, the more the
Panthers win. But the better
Kellii Taylor and company
get, the closer they come to
leaving Pitt early and heading
to the world of professional
basketball.

Their toughest non-confer-
ence opponents in the first
swing of the season, Georgia
and North Carolina, demon-
strate two contrasting possibil-
ities for the Panthers’ future.

Last Saturday at the Civic
Arena, the Panthers were
given a painful lesson on how
sweet life could be like in
three years if Ralph Willard’s
fab five decide to stick
around.

The Bulldogs start five
seniors and their sixth man is
also in his lastseason. Their
experience proved valuable in
their 85-66 win, especially in
the second half when Georgia
took advantage of many men-
tal Panther defensive lapses.

Georgia’s front line of '
Carlos Strong, Shandon
Anderson and Terrell Bell was
especially dominant in taming
young Panthers Mark Blount,
Andre Howard and Michael
Gill. The Bulldog trio
outscored the Panther front
three 51-26 and out-rebound-
ed them 26-14.

The Bulldogs backcourt of
Pertha Robinson and Katu
Davis controlled the tempo of
the game to perfection for
Georgia as the duo combined
for 20 points, eight boards and
seven assists.

The five Bulldog starters
have a combined 200 career
starts, and Strong has started
each of his 90 games at
Georgia.

The senior-packed Bulldogs
are a large contrast to the‘
North Carolina Tar Heels.

If you’re here over
Christmas break, go to the
spacious Civic Arena and ,
through all the empty seats
you will see a team, that if it’s
top recruits had stuck around,

Pitt finishes second in Locly Panther Invitational

By Kevin Lilley
Staff Writer

The Rhode Island Rams cap-
tured the Pitt-Dollar Bank Lady
Panthers’ Invitational
Tournament on Sunday, defeat-
ing the hosts 69-66.

The Lady Panthers took home-
court advantage, height advan-
tage and a momentum-building
81-50 semifinal blowout of
Robert Morris into the finals but
fell short in the closing seconds
to the experienced Rams.

“[Rhode Island] had four
seniors returning,” said Pitt head
coach Kirk Bruce, “and they
played like it.”

Marcie Byrd, one of the retum-
ing Rams, helped her squad to a
41-33 halftime advantage by
scoring sixteen points in the first
frame. Byrd also helped defen-
sively, holding Pitt forward
Stephanie Petho to two points in
the first half, both from the free-
throw line.

The lead ballooned to 15 early
in the second, after a 13-6 Ram
run featuring a driving layup by
Tasha King and a three-pointer
by point guard Dayna Smith.‘
This mix of power and outside
shooting kept the Panther
defense on its heels,’forcing a
total of 25 team fouls throughout
the game and forcing Bruce to
take a time out to stop the Ram-
attack. 1

A mix of early foul trouble and
poor performance led to a youth
movement for the rest of the half,
with Petho and junior LaTonya
Durham on the bench and fresh-
men Kellie Nelson and Alecia
Balich taking the ﬂoor in reserve.

“We seem to fallbehind with

veterans and come back with 

older players,” said Bruce. And
in this contest, that’s exactly
what happened.

In a little over five minutes, a -

15-point dominance became a
five—point game. Freshman Gina
Montesano finished off a 10-0
Pitt run with an outside jumper
to cut Rhode Island’s lead to 56-
51. I

Withthe Rams reeling, Pitt
junior Melissa Thompson took
over, scoring six points in four
minutes to keep the Lady
Panthers close at 64-61.
Montesano took a pass from
Balich and drained an outside
jumper to pull Pitt within one.
Then Montesano answered
Rhode Island senior Jamie
Gray’s foul shot with two of her
own, knotting the score at 65.
Pitt took a 66-65 lead on another
Montesano foul shot.

Marcie Byrd came back to res-
cue the Rams in the final two
minutes, making a jump shot to

, reclaim the lead. Two more free

throws by Grey and a late _tl1ree-
point miss by Pitt’s Latia
Howard yielded the 69-66 ﬁnal.
Bruce blamed the loss on over-

When Tubby Smith took over as head coach. for the

underachieving Georgia Bulldogs this year, he had one of .

1992’s top five recruiting classes waiting for him.

This year, Pitt coach Ralph Willard corralled one of ‘95’s
best freshmen classes.

In a battle of classes, Willard’s young litter expected a
cat fight but received a good 01’ fashion 85-66 stomping
by Smith’s inherited senior-laden ‘Dogs at the Civic Arena

 Saturday.

“We tried to tell the kids today that we were playing a

I very good senior-dominated team,” Willard said. “I don’t
' know if they understood prior to today. But I’ll tell you,

they understand now.”

Smith said,” I thought experience was the. number one
factor in the game.” .

Georgia’s experience broke down the Panthers (1-1) in
every facet of the game. The Bulldogs consistently dis-
mantled Pitt’s traps and presses by going over the top of
the defense. As a result, Georgia shot 57 percent from the
field. While Georgia (3-0) converted easy fast break layups
all afternoon, half of Pitt’s 72 shots came from behind the
three-point are, which explains the Panthers’ horrendous
26-percent shooting percentage. A

“We were out of sync offensively,” Willard said.

That was evident from the opening tipoff. Georgia
jumped out to a quick 7-0 lead behind Pitt’s tentative play
and would never trail in the game.

Moving at a slow pace for two up-tempo teams, Pitt was
only down 11-7 at the 15:11 mark. But thenthe Panthers
played dead for almost an eight-minute span. In that time,

Pitt scored only three points, resulting in a 14-3

Georgia run. -
After a timeout with 7:59 left in the first half,

I Pitt responded with a lightning 10-2 run behind
. - three-pointers by Jerry McCullough and Andre
‘ Alridge.

Then the Panthers came back with an even

I quicker 9-2 run, sparked by the same duo.

After McCullough hit a three from behind the
pro arc, Alridge canned consecutive bombs to
cut Georgia’s lead to three, 35-32, at the 1:03
mark. P

With the momentum shifting, Pitt went into
halftime down 40-34. -

Plagued by foul trouble throughout the first
half, the Panthers’ most experienced big men,
Gerald Jordan and Chad Varga, were quickly

2‘. pined in the second frame as well. With not

even four minutes gone by, both Varga and
Jordan picked up their fourth fouls.

“Once we got in foul trouble, it was really
men playing 'with boys,’.’ Willard said.

And the men took over in the second half.

= The frontcourt of Carlos Strong, Shandon

Anderson and Terrell Bell tore apart Pitt from
the inside, outside and everywhere in between.
Anderson led all scorers with 22 points. Strong
finished with 20, and Bell, the 6-foot-inch,
235-pound chiseled center, punched away six
of Pitt’s shots.

With the Panthers’ experience on the pines
and their floor general McCullough ice cold,
the Bulldogs gave Pitt’s freshmen a hearty dose
of reality as they outscored the Panthers by 13
in the second half. Vonteego Cummings, the
star of last Wednesday’s game against
Duquesne, went scoreless with three turnovers.

“Freshmen are freshmen,” Willard said. “If
you watch our practices, you could say that
about any one of our kids. One day one of them
has a great practice, and the next day is like,
‘Come on.’ Right now they’re going through
the baptism of fire.”

And according to Willard, it’s not just the
freshmen who are learning. McCullough, a

fifth-year senior who sat out last season, is still

adjusting to Willard’s system.

all free-throw shooting (under
66 percent for the game), poor
ball handling and weakness
under the basket.

“Anytime you get outre-
bounded by 10,” Bruce said,
“it’s just not that good.”

Bruce praised the freshman
contribution to the effort, espe-
cially the play of Montesano,
who ﬁnished with 13 points to
lead the Pitt scorers. Latia
Howard, who played only 23
minutes due to a mild illness,
also managed 13, as well as
nine rebounds.

Howard and Stephanie Petho
were Pitt’s representatives on
the a1l—toumament team, despite
Petho only managing four
points in the final contest. She
earned her spot on Saturday,
with 17 points and eight
rebounds in Pitt’s 80-51 defeat
of Robert Morris.

The tournament’s Most

, Outstanding Player was Rhode

Island’s King, who scored 20 in
the final and posted 21 points
and 12 boards in the Rams’ 75-

f

55 defeat of Davidson in the
semifinals.

Smith represented Rhode
Island on the all-tournament
squad after notching nine assists
and six steals against Pitt. A
graduate of nearby Penn Hills
High School, Dayna came back
to haunt the Panthers, who lost
her in a recruiting battle to the
Rams.

Davidson freshman Kerry
Brown, another local product
from Upper St. Clair High,
made the all-star squad with a
10-point performance in her
team’s semifinal loss.
Davidson’s other local tie,
freshman forward Jessica
Montrella from Altoona, scored
eight points and blocked two
shots in the semifinal matchup.

Rounding out the tournament
team was Davidson’s Carolyn
Kirch, who managed 17 of the
team’s 55 points against Rhode
Island in the semis.

In the toumament’s consola-
tion matchup, Davidson took
third place with an 84-68 victo-
ry over Robert Monis.

North Carolina lines up
sophomore Sham mond
Williams at guard and junior
lid Geth at forward, two solid
players. But they’re nothing
compared to their predeces-
sors, Jerry Stackhouse and’
Rashccd Wallace.

Those two stars took the
leave—school-early option,
and. instead of competing for
a national championship this
March. the Tar Heels will be
competing for a top three seed
in the ACC Tournament.

Pitt could end up like either
Georgia or North Carolina.
Three years from now, it
could be a senior-packed team
with a couple of All-Big East
selections, like Gill and
Vonteego Cummings. They
could be looking at a 20-win
season and a top 10 ranking.

Or two or three from this
group could decide to leave
early and give the NBA a
shot

Hopefully, Ralph Willard
will use his keen recruiting
skills that convinced these
players to come to Pitt and get
all of these blue-chippers to
stay for four years. ‘

If so, 1998 will be a year to
remember.

walk in the park for Jerry
McCullough after not playing
for a year,” Willard said.
“Certainly after two games I
think everybody understands
that.”

McCullough went 4 of 18
from the field, en route to his
benching for a good chunk of
the second half. _He led all
Panthers with 15 points.

‘»‘Maybe he feels that since
we have so many young play-
ers, he has to take the burden
of scoring,” Willard said.
“We’re not going to be good if
he does that. We need to get
people involved in the
offense."

Alridge. who took over for
McCullough at point. finished
with 12 points and five assists.
Freshmen Andre Howard and
Michael Gill gave Pitt some
bench help. Howard scored ll
points. and Gill notched nine
with five hoards.

“l think this was a good
measuring stick for our basket-
ball team." Willard said. "This
was a good game to see how
far we have to go. and obvi-
ously it's a long way."
