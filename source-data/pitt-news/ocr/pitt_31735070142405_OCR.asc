Young people most uninsured

LindsayrCarroll
Assistant News Editor

Steve Kurpiewski gets paid to ﬁx
bikes. His ﬁngers are grimy from
tuning derailleurs, truing wheels and
greasing chains.

Every day, Kurpiewski rides to and
from work at Iron City Bikes, a bike
sales and mechanic shop on South

Bouquet Street. He makes sure to
follow traffic laws as closely as pos-
sible, using bike ﬁghts and turning

' signals.

Because if he were to‘ get hit by a
car, Kurpiewski would be thousands
of dollars in debt.

Kurpiewski, 24, is among the
nearly one—third of young Americans

which has no health insurance. People

aged 19 to 29 are the least insured age

group in the nation, according to a
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention report.

a “I am at a bit of a higher risk for
needing medical care, but that’s just a
risk I’m taking,” Kurpiewski said.

Young people are the least likely
age group to have health insurance,
and when they do have it, they have
problems accessing it.’ Policy mak-
ers, researchers and the White House

have acknowledged that if Washing-
ton aims to provide coverage op-
tions for the uninsured, lawmakers
must ﬁgure out how to target that

age group.

Insurance 4 1

published a 2008 report that found
that young people are more likely to
be uninsured because they face the
same problems that affect the average
uninsured population — and those
problems affect young adults more.

“The uninsured tend to be low-
income, and even though most are
in working families, they don’t have
access to employer—based health in-
surance or can’t afford it,” Schwartz
said.

The Kaiser Family Foundation

l report found that whﬂe 31 percent

of young people are uninsured, only
18 percent of non—elderly people

' overall lack insurance. Most elderly

people qualify for health care under
the Medicare system.
Schwartz said that one option for

young people is to purchase a special

“catastrophic” plan that has minimal
coverage. _ ' .

“Some young adults canpurchase
these catastrophic plans with rnini—
mal coverage, but it’s hard to know if
you would have a beneﬁt that would
also protect you if you got sick,” she
said. “If you got cancer, the drugs you
needed [might not] be covered. Or it
may not cover maternity care.”

Employer-based health care

Dr. Scott Tyson, a pediatrician at
Pediatrics South in Pittsburgh, said
many ofhis patients lose their health
coverage after they turn 19 or after
they graduate college, when they are
usually no longercovered undertheir
parents’ plans.

Tyson said many of his patients

come from affluent areas, so their

V parents can afford to help them pay
for insurance or to send them to col- '

lege. But at his McKees Rocks ofﬁce
—— located in a less affluent area of
Pittsburgh —— his patients are more
likely to get jobs after college, and
therefore, less likely to have health
care.

One of the major problems that
makes low—income and youngpeople

less likely to have health insurance is '

that small businesses have difficulty
purchasing coverage for their e'rn-
ployees and companies with many
young workers are less likely to offer
insurance, Schwartz said.
Largeﬁrms canself-insure — they
can hire an insurance company to
administer a beneﬁts plan — but as

the ﬁrms get smaller, the situation i

looks more like the individual market,
she said. '

“If you have 100,000 workers,
chances are itwill even out,” she said.
“But if you have four workers and one
of themhas cancer, that’s ahuge cost
to an insurance company. The small-
group market just doesn’t work as
well as the large group market.”

Young people are more likely than
older people to work at smallerﬁrms
and small businesses, because they
tend to work entry-level orwage-level

positions before working their way.

up. This trend decreases with an in-
crease in education. About 15 percent
of college graduates are uninsured,
Schwartz said.

Most of the young people who are
uninsured are employed either full-
time or part-time_, according to the

Kaiser Family Foundation study. The ’

study found that 56 percent of unin-
sured young adults work full—time,
while 15 percent work part-time‘, 8
percent are ﬁ.1ll-time students and 21
percent are unemployed. For adults

v aged 30 to 64, 61 percent are full-time

workers, 12 percent work part-time
and 27 percent are unemployed.

' . Kurpiewski graduated from Pitt
last yearwith acreative writing major,

, but he said he isn’t sure what he will

do with his degree. -

He said it’s often hard for small
businesses to pay for health care.
Many of the people who work at
small businesses can understand
the problem.

“If you work at an intimate level
with the business owner, you can see
ﬁnancesa little more,” he said. “[Pro-
viding] health care for everybody
would be a ridiculous cost.” _

The White House health care re-
form website, www.healthreforrn.
gov, issued a series of promotions say-

ing how its health reform plan could ‘

help various demographics, including
young people.

“The typical young adult frequent-
ly changes jobs, moves or holds part-
time ortemporary jobs,” the site says.
“Under reform, it doesn’t matter —
you will always have choices of qual-'
ity, affordable health insurance.”

“Health reform will offer health
insurance to those withoutjob-based
coverage and provide premium assis-

tancetothosewhostillcan’taffordit,” S

the White House website says.
Tyson, the pediatrician, is a

member of Physicians for a Nation-

al Health Program, a national group

Smallbusiness owners struggle to offer insurance

that lobbies for single—payer health
care — a system inwhich the govern-
ment would collect money to pay for
health care, similar to the systems in
the United Kingdom and Australia.

Tyson said he became “disillu-
sioned” with the current health sys-
tem about 10 or 12 years ago.

“I think I started to realize that
there had been a dramatic change
in health care, and a lot of people
weren’.t getting services that the
needed,” Tyson said. '

Most people get their insurance
through their jobs, he said, and this

presents aproblemformanypeople, A

especially in a struggling economy.‘
He said this is a main reason why
he would like a national health pro-

“It would be  if you had aﬁre in

your house, and you’re not allowed‘

to call the ﬁre department to get you
out,” Tyson said. “Some of it’s so
goofy, you can’t believe it.”

The possibility of reform

Many interest groups currently
lobby Washington, including reform
critic America’s Health Insurance Pro-
grams, which advocates on behalf of
health insurance companies. Young
Invincibles lobbies for the opposing
position: health care reform that
could help insure young adults.

The U.S. Senate passed a multi—bil—
lion dollar health care reform bill on
Dec. 24 that awaits negotiations with
the White House to earn President
Barack Obama’s signature. Schwartz
said the effects of the reform propos-
als are yet to be determined.

Students have ‘day on’ for Martin Luther King Day

Two student groups remember Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. with community service

Eva-Bugos
' For The Pitt News

While much of the campus was still asleep '

yesterday, about 150 students arrived at
the William Pitt Union to participate in
the Martin Luther King Day of Service.

The National Society of Black Engineers .
and the Black Action Society organized the -

event, called “Dr. King Day of Service — A

. Day On, Not a Day Off.”

Though this is the event’s ﬁrst year, or-
ganizers hope to make it an annual event,
inviting more organizations to join as the
event grows. The purpose of the event,
which began‘around»1O a.m., is to “give
back to the community  and teach and
learn the ways of Dr. Martin Luther King
]r.’s life,” according to its website.

Oyinkansola Dina, community outreach
chair of the Black Action Society, said that
a day of service seemed ﬁtting because
King “served his entire life. We’re trying to
relive his dream of servingpeople without
asking for anything in return.”

Students had different reasons for vol-
unteering. _

’ “I feltilike I shouldn’t be out shop-

ping,” said Efe Oghoghome. f‘There was

so much that he meant to the country 
I just thought about that and felt like I
should give something back.” '

For_ C] Jeter, the day off meant he had
time to volunteer. “I just have a soft spot
for community service. It is Martin Luther
King Day, but I actually had time to actu-

their time in its activity center. Twelve
volunteers, includingvDina, Jeter and Og-
hoghome, talked to children about King’s
legacy and played with them while they

waited. They also colored in pages that ‘A

ally give back.” a

At 11 a.m., students took buses to vol-
unteer at locations throughout the city.
The Family Activity Center at the Allegh-
eny Countyjail was a main volunteer site.
Visitors can wait for an hour before visit-
ing someone at the jail, so families pass

‘different colors,” Dina said.

Volunteers also worked at the Marion
Manor nursing facility. At the Carnegie
Library, volunteers packed books and
stationery to be sent to other Pittsburgh
libraries and facilities to promote chil-
dren’s literacy. Many student volunteers

stayed at the WPU. They. wrote and il-
lustrated stories, which Jumpstart — an
organization to foster early childhood
literacy — collected and will pass out to
preschool-aged children. Volunteers also.
took the clothing they collected during
a weeklong drive to the Salvation Army
and the Children’s Home of Pittsburgh.
Students ﬁnished working and returned
to campus between 2 and 3 p.m.

The day of service is one of several
events that honor King. The Black Ac-
tion Society and Equipoise sponsored a
Unity Brunch to bring together staff and‘
students on Friday afternoon. Equipoise
is a staff, student and faculty organization
that advises Pitt’s administration on issues
pertaining to African Americans and the
University. On Friday night, the Heinz
Memorial Chapel held an interfaith service
in “Celebration of the Life and Legacy of
the Rev.,Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.”

Tonight, Dr. Maejemison, the first Af-
rican-American woman to go into space,
will speak in David Lawrence Hall at 8:45
p.m. Campus Women’s Organization will
present “Honoring Women Heroes of the
Civil Rights Movement” on Wednesday,
and there will be a Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. Oratory Contest on Thursday.

Proposal extends Medicaid to 61 percent of young adults 8

Insurance 4 3

One thing thatwill deﬁnitely help uninsured
young people is the proposal to expand Medic-
aid coverage, Schwartz said. According to her
report, Medicaid, a public plan aimed at low-

. income families, does not apply to 74 percent
, of young adults. Low—income adults are only

eligible for Medicaid if they are pregnant, a
custodial parent or disabled, according to the
report. 8 .

The House of Representatives passed a pro-
posal that would expand Medicaid coverage to

people who live at 150 percent of the poverty
level — currently around $17,000 armual in-
come. Schwartz said the proposal would cover
61 percent of young adults.

“Medicaid has very low premiums, and his-
torically, has a very comprehensive beneﬁts
package,” she said.

Currently, federal law mandates that when

young adults turn 19, they no longer qualify as '

dependents on their parents’ health insurance
programs unless they are in college. Obama has

proposed extending that age to 25.
Many states, including Pennsylvania, have
passed laws that would allow private insurers

. to cover young adults under their families’ in-

surance packages until age 30. Although these
laws have gone into effect, Schwartz said they
don’t necessarily cure the problem. The laws will
only help those whose parents have employer-
sponsored coverage.

“It is also unclear how ‘dependent’ will be
deﬁned and who will qualify,” she said.

According to her report, increasing this

- coverage will help ﬁillitime students most.

But young people who don’t attend school or
are married, attend school part-time or live
in a different state than their parents are less
likely to beneﬁt. . A

Self-insured employer plans, typically used
by large ﬁrms with more than 500 employees,
aren’t subjectto state regulations on insurance,
Schwartz said. One study estimated that 55 per-
cent of employees have these kinds of plans.

The federal insurance plans for reform, simi-
lar to the state—based initiatives, also remain un-
clear about exactly how they will help younger
adults. Schwartz said that this depends on how
much age rating will be allowed — to what ex-
tent insurance companies can vary premiums
based on the policy owner’s age.

If the legislation allows for a lot of age rating,
premiums will be less for young people. If not

‘ _ a lot of age rating is allowed, premiums will be

more expensive for that age group, Schwartz

V said.

The psychology of being young

Not everyone blames lack of insured youth
on employment or cost. Mary Ahn, who works

' at Medicaid’s national office, said she thought ‘

the lack of insurance was mostly caused by the
“arrogance of youth.” - —

“When you’re in that age range, you don’t
typically have alotofhealth issues,” Ahn said. “I
think young people typically don’t understand

how critical it is, how vulnerable everyone is,

“It would not surprise me at all if a female

Editorial

The pre-med ,
personality test

or an applicant, getting into
medical school has longbeen a
balancing act. A student is as-
sessed on several main qualities and
competencies, including a solid GPA,
goodMCAT‘scores andvaried extracur-
ricular activities, preferably including
clinical experience, volunteering and
taking part in some form of scientiﬁc
research. Letters of recommendation
and countless essays also accompany
the application. ,
The latter ostensibly gives adrnis—
sions committees a taste of the ap-
plicant’s personality. However, the
interview, if the applicant is so worthy,
enables schools to decide whether an
applicant has the right material to be
adoctor.
Arec_entst11dyinthe_]ournalofAp-‘
plied Psychology addresses analterna—

tive method: a personality test;

The study focused on the Big Five
personality traits: extraversion, neu-
roticism, openness, agreeableness and
conscientiousness — the ﬁve broad
traits deﬁning human personality in
contemporary psychology.

Psychologists in the study adn1in—
istered the test to 600 students in

‘Belgium, where the pre-medical and
medicalcurriculumissirnilarto curricu-
lum in the United States. It focuses on
understandingthe basic sciences inthe
early years and concentrates on clini-
cal knowledge in the later years. They
then followed these students through-
out their education, noting academic

. performance and attrition rates.

Neuroticism correlated with poor
academic performance and attrition
Conscientiousness showed to be a
strong predictor of success in medi-
cal school. The importance of open-
ness, agreeableness and extraversion
increased over time with extraversion
beingthe most signiﬁcant, aslateryears
in education included more time with
patients. '

The study suggests standardizing
the methods medical schools use for
understandingapotential student’s per-
sonality. Currently, recommendations,
essays and interviews suﬁice. This is a

relativelyvariable method considering
how cognitive ability is traditionally
assessed.

Although this would level the play-
ingﬁeldfor applicants and reduce unin-

tentional advantages and disadvantages
of the current system, like different in-
terviewers, itstillleaves questions about
its feasibility and validity.

‘ The inalienable righttopursue hap-
piness entails that anyone can make
anything of himself or herself. Every
Americancanachieveabetterlife, even
if thatis deﬁned as anacceptance letter
to medical school. Personalityis inher-
ent, and falling short on a category on
any suchtest could notbe penalized, as
that would be  a person based
on what they cannot work harder to
improve. Maybe the test would have
to ﬁnd a way around this.

Another concemwould be thatthe
testwouldbe standardized; Fortyyears
ago, ahighschoolstudentsignal up for
his SAT, satforthetestandleftthe test-
ing center: Today, one can ﬁnd endless
books and courses on how to ace the
exam. Similarly, given enough time,
this test too could become a target of
testprep companies, orwebsites atthe
least, aimingto help students get in.

There will always be students who
know how to perfect their, application
ineach and every category—this per-
sonality test will be no different. ,

Although a proposed personality
testcould includeasystemtodetectthe
veracity of students responses, many
still will answer what they feel an ad-
missions oﬂicer would most want to
see. Ifdifferent medical schools value
dilferentfocuses more, suchasresearch
versus primary care, different person-
alities would serve each one differently.
This would provide a ﬁrewall against
suidents trying to dupe the test.

The study hada good intentinpro—
posing such standardization, that is,
standardization itself, in making the
application process more fair. It also
provides hope for those that feel they
have the right material to be a doctor,
but are aﬁaid their multiple choice ex-
ams might notmaketheirdreamreach—
able. However, the implementation of
such a test would have to be wary of
effectiveness and validity.

5If pre-meds want to see how they '

would fare in such a system, they can
takethe Big Five PersonalityTest on Fa-
cebook, a similar test in the categories
tested. For now, continue studying or-
ganic chemistry, whichis still required
for admission, alas.

Pat Robertson’s diagnosis of Haiti’s fateis rooted inftnaricialmterest V

When you look at the Haitian suffer-

ing, you might ask, “How could God '

allow this to happen?” God didn’t
allow it to happen. God caused it

to happen. The earthquake is just-

His latest blight on those cursed
pagans.

At least that’s the explanation if
you are televangelist Marion Rob -'
ertson. It’s Pat!

During an episode of ‘‘The 700
Club” on his Christian Broadcasting
Network, Robertson was‘ a-pontiﬁ—

catin’ and said God punished Haiti V

because of a centuries—old"‘pact
with the devil.”

He said this is a “curse” that also
explains Haiti’s enduring poverty.

Robertso‘n’s net is estimated T

at somewhere between $200 mil-

, lion and $1 billion. Even the shallow

end is prettyballer. Break some
bread, Pat. :—

He has since complained that
his words were taken out of context
—— in fairness, the show was dis-
playing a disaster relief donations
phone number — so here is the
extended version of his statement:
“Something happened a long time
ago in Haiti and people might not
want to talk about it. They were

_ under the heel of the French, you
know, Napoleon the Third and

whatever. And they got together
and swore a pact to the devil. They
said, ‘We will serve you if you will
get us free from the prince.’ True
story. So the devil said, ‘OK, it’s
a deal.’ Then, they kicked out the
French. The Haitians revolted and

got something themselves fre_e._But

ever since, they have been cursed

_ by one thing after the other.” A

Napoleon and whatever, huh?
Good to see Robertson is a history
buff. It must serve him well in com-
prehending the layered historical
signiﬁcance of the Bible.‘

Also, at the risk of nitpickery,

the devil didn’t say, “OK, let’s make’

a deal,” in the 1790s. “OK” wasn’t
inventeduntil the late 1830s. It was
an abbreviation for the satirical
phrase “O11 korrect.” Funny that
Robertson would use this twist-
ed mockery of truth in his own
claims. i

As for “Let’s make a deal,” I’m

not Daniel Webster, but Lucifer’st

vocabulary is probably closer to
Cicero than Howie Mandel.

But I get the point. Robertson
didn’t completely fabricate this

story, It is folklore.

Yet, he’s accepting this myth as
truth and propagating it on nation-
al television. What’s worse is that
he makes a killing doing it.

He founded the Christian Co-
alition of America, the Christian
Broadcasting Network and the
popular broadcast “The 700 Club,”
which garners about 900,000
viewers daily, according to Media
Matters.’ ‘ -

Robertson is like a theological
mob boss extorting chumps for
their money in exchange for “pro-
tection.” A frightened ﬂock pays
him for security in the afterlife. His
wild jeremiads also make them pay

for protection on Earth.

Robertson and other hoods,
like Jack van Impe, shake down
the masses by claiming divine in-
sight. _ ’ -
When Hurricane Katrina struck
New Orleans, Robertson implied
that it was connected to legalized
abortion. He did so by referencing
Leviticus. I

Hopefully, that book’s section
on animal sacriﬁce came in handy
when his $520,000 thoroughbred
named Mr. Pat failed to run in the
Kentucky Derby.

-So Robertson believes a holy
wrath connects the destruction in
Haiti and New Orleans. They have

something else in common: a lot of
black people.

Robertson, a champion homo-
phobe, is no stranger to hating
people different than he is.

According to the BBC, the Bank

of Scotlandpulled out of a joint»

business venture with Robertson

‘ after he called Scotland “a dark

land overrun by homosexuals.”

His nickname is Pat, so I guess
that makes him an authority.

He also wrote a book titled “New
World Order,” in which he vomited
ahost of outrageous theories, some
of which invoked a global Jewish
conspiracy. ‘

In 1976, he even predicted that
the world would end in 1982. He’s
a quack," a false prophet who has
duped millions of we1l—intentioned
patsies into misplacing their de-
votion. His scheme is the Golden
Fleece.

He ran for president in 1988

because he said God told him to ‘

do it. In his campaign, he said he
served combat duty in the Korean
War, but a fellow Marine said he
just served alcohol. Surely, it was
Communion.

The bigger deal is that he ran for
president after he herded 3 million
sheep into supporting his bid. Yet,
if he knew what God wanted, if God
favored this gross shepherd, why
didn’t God kill his opponents?

Political assassination is ﬁne by
Him. After all, Robertson suggested
assassinating Hugo Chavez.

He said, “I don’t know about this
doctrine of assassination, but if he
thinks we’re trying to assassinate
him, I think that we really ought to
go ahead and do it. It’s a whole lot
cheaper than starting a war.”

So that’s what Jesus would do.

parently have a free pass as long as
it saves money.

For a refresher, it’s legitimate
to kill a Venezuelan and so long as
we’re to interpret Leviticus liter-
ally, it’s required to kill homosexu-

the world. , '

ertson’s thoughts on Marxism and

the Illuminati, and he has millions
of followers.

Some are bigoted. Some are ig-
norant. Despite Matthew 7:1, they
judge others because it saves them
from introspection. If a tragedy
were to befall Robertson, it would
not be punishment, but rather a
Job-like test of his sterling faith.

Yet, many of his followers are
most likely scared and just hedging
their bets.

Robertson is the crooked bookie
willing to bilk them. The suffer-
ing in Haiti is a tragedy. Robertson
says as much himself, but it’s also
a lucrative opportunity for him to
sell insurance. Ain’t no valley low
enough.

According to the CIA World
Factbook, the population in Haiti
was a little more than 9 million
people. The Telegraph reports that
the death toll from the earthquake

phe in modern U.S. history, and
Robertson didn’t miss a cheat.

On “The 700 Club,” two days af-
ter the attacks, fellow televangelist
Jerry Falwell said, “I really believe
that the pagans and the abortionists
and the feminists and the gays and
the lesbians  the ACLU, People for
the American Way, all of them who
tried to secularize America, I point
the ﬁnger in their face and say, ‘You
helped this happen.”’

/Robertson said, “I totally con-
cur.”

I imagine it was a ﬁindraising
boon. He wouldn’t continue saying
these things if it wasn’t. Maybe he’s
not a racist. He’s just a perverted
old goblin.

There is no more hateful per-
son who wears a bigger smile. But
that doesn’t mean I expect God to
smite him.

‘Human Target’ might have bombs and babes, but it lacks originality and interest

“Human Target”

Fox

Wednesdays 8 to 9 p.m. (Series
premiere airs 9 to 10 p.m. Jan.

.20.)

Starring: Mark Valley, Chi
McBride
Grade_:C

Comic book adaptations cer-
tainly have potential, but Fox’s
new series, “Human Target,” is
at best hit or miss.

As the title suggests, “Human ~

Target” is not a particularly com-
plex or thought-provoking show
— and it doesn’t have to be. Many
TV shows can thrive off suspense
alone, but “Target” offers little of
anything to compensate for its
stupidity.

Based on Peter Milligan’s
graphic novel, “Target’,’ tells the
story of pr-ivate contractor Chris-
topher Chance (Mark Valley),
whose job is to integrate himself
into the lives of threatened cli-
ents — usually attractive women

- and make the clients appear
vulnerable and then strike the
assassins when they show them-
selves.. «
When he’s not in the midst of
kicking butt, Chance corresponds
with boss Winston (Chi McBride)

’ and super—nerd Guerrero (Jackie

Earle Haley) to solve the mystery
of who’s trying to knock off his
clients.

Cameo appearances by actors
such as Danny Glover round out
the not—inconsiderable list of tal-
ent. V

Unfortunately, the screen-
writing of “Human Target” can’t
equal the quality of its cast. The
ﬁrst two episodes are both set in
fast-moving vehicles — the ﬁrst
on a newly unveiled train and the
second on a plane.

Because the assassination of a
single person isn’t inherently sus-
penseful enough, both episodes
inevitably wind up as “Speed”-like

scenarios involving the fate of the by

entire vehicle.

Given the already—repe_titive
nature of the ﬁrst two episodes,
an immediate problem the show

Chance handles each catastrophe with
the unexcited demeanor of the blandest

The ﬁrst two episodes reveal virtually

Quince and Egeus.

” Several actors will take on multiple
roles, as well — a challenge that Coleman
said he ﬁnds “fresh” and “exciting.”

«He describes this year’s production as

“charming,” “visually stunning” and sure

to be full of surprises. While most produc-

tions only use four or ﬁve entrances for
characters, “Midsummer” will include
14.

But after almost 400 years of Shake-

remains relevant for audiences pruned to

though he’s acted in numerous TV and
film roles, including a, role “Silence of
the Lambs,” Coleman said he feels noth-
ing compares to performing Shakespeare
on stage.

“There is no magical relationship be-

- tween the audience and the characters

as what you see in a live theater perfor-
mance,” he said, “especially in comedy,

 

 

where you actually get to hear people, wait
for them to laugh and have fun.” ‘

Coleman said he doesn’t think the high-
tech world will oust “Midsummer” any
time soon, either. _l

“I think it will be around for anoth-
er 400 years without any problem,” he
said. a '

Despite the dense language, Coleman

said he knows all audiences will be able ‘

to relate to the plot of,-'the play.

“How many of us were in love with per-
son A, and for some reason, somebody
told us we should be in love with person
B?” he asked.

The play also explores the link between
our personal realities and the unknown —-

a theme not much different from today’s '

blockbuster movies.

“It’s a wonderful exploration of spirit,”
Coleman said. “Our world and the fantasy
world keep bumping up against each other
in a very fascinating way.” .

Even those with a short attention span
will enjoy the performance, which lasts
just slightly more than two hours.

“Ted [Pappas] has done some very nice
editing. His technique is to keep some-
thing moving. He does not like ponderous
produ_ctions,”,Co1eman said.

‘ To those who might still feel apprehen-
sive about jumping into Shakespeare, this
, comedy might be a great starting point.

very clear.” - . . .

Tennis 4 1

Deffenbach separates father, coach roles 

Diana Connor I SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
After transferring to Pitt, junior Sarah Dieffenbach will play for her
dad, women’s tennis coach George Dieffenbach (above).

George Mason. She saw Pitt and
[George Mason] as very different
schools,” George said. “Shethoughtthe
tennis program was better at the Uni-
versity ofPittsburgh. That, in addition
to the factthatshe wantedto complete
her education closerto home, washer
motivation in transferring to Pi ”

Sarah said she loves the oppor-
tunity to be around her dad while at
college.

“I absolutely enjoy having my dad
on campus so muc ,” she said. ‘‘we’ll
get lunch, then go to practice and
sometimes I’ll see him at home. We
have a really good relationship and
it’s nice to be around him as "much as
I can.”

George said he also admires Sarah
asatennis player. V

“She will get a lot of balls in play,
be a consistent tennis player and will
win because her opponent will make
more errors — I like that in a player,”
he said. “She is steady and uses her
head, andisvery consistent. That’s her
style of play. She plays the whole court
on the offensive, as well as defensive,
sides and varies her game in terms of
power, placement, spin and strategy.
She has great potential, and so does
the rest of the team.”

Buttlriatdoesdtnecessarilymakeit
easy for Sarahto separate “dad” from

“coach” on the tennis court.

“Sometimes Iwantto askhimper—
sonal questions on the court or during
practice, but I have to keep my focus
when we are all practicing as a team,”
Sarah said.

As for the team, her teammates
said they don’t think the family ties
get in the way.

“They do really well working to-
gether, and I know Sarah really likes
the support of her dad on the court,”

junior Elizabeth Adams said.

‘fcoach Dieffenbach does a good

job of separating when he is Sarah’s
coach and when he is her dad. I con-
sider her another teammate and she
brings a great dynamic to the team,”
sophomore Minh Evans said.

After graduating in 1975, George,
then 22, became the youngest head
coach in the NCAA for the Pitt men’s
tennisteam. In1981, Dieffenbach, who
holds the record for most women’s
tennis wins in school history, became
the head coach of both the men’s and
women’s tennis teams, and now he is
excited atthe opportiinityto coachhis
own daughter.

N “Iwasarookie, Iwasyoung, andthe
players Iwas coachingwere very close
tomyage,” he said. ‘§AsImat11red, Ibe-
came anolder brotherto those players
in terms of the age differential. Now,

all of a sudden, I am old enough to bg
the father of the players in that age
bracket.”

But in the Dieffenbach family,
tennis is not the only sport of choice.
George’s son, Miles, is a senior at Fox
Chapel Area High School who plays
center for the football team.

7 In June, despite visiting the Pan-
thers camp and receivingascholarship
offer from Pitt, Miles gave Penn_State a
verbal commitment. George said Miles
wanted to get away from Pittsburgh
for college and get an education from.
another school. ’

“It was avery difficult decision for
Miles, and we raised him to think for
himself,” George said. “He loves Pitt
and always will. Itwas nothing negative
about Pitt. Hewastreated tremendous-
ly during the recruiting process, and I
have nothing but the utmost respect
for coach Wannstedt.”

George, who grew up in the W11-
liamsport, Pa., area, has three Nittany
Lion ties throughhisfather, sister and
aunt. -at

“I have some blood with Penn State
connections, so when I came to Pitt, it
was an interesting rivalry,” he said.

Now, he said, he will be able to
watch his son play college football.

“Both schools are great, butwewill
always be Pitt fans,” he said.

S I’m here to talk about the past.’

Five years ago, Mark McGwire refused
to do so at a congressional hearing on ste-

roids, instead wanting “to be positive about
. this subject.”

V But last week, McGwire admitted his
steroid use, a habit that he said began in
1989 and included his 1998 7o—home run
season. . .

“I’m coming clean and being honest,”
he said. .

In response to McGwire’s admission,
commissioner Bud Selig chose not to take

think we’re being too lenient on the trans-
gressors of the steroid era.

“This statement of contrition,” Selig
said, “will make Mark’s reentry into the
game much smoother and easier.” Cardinals
manager To‘ny'LaRussa, said he’d love MCG-
wire, recently hired as‘the St. Louis hitting

‘ coach, to pinch-hit once this year.

I’m glad we’ve ﬁnally got these wrongdo-
ers out of the game. S

McGwire released his statement on a
Monday afternoon — the Monday after
undefeated No. 1 Kansas fell to Tennessee,

I can’t help but think we’re being too lenient on
the transgressors of the steroid era. ’

action.
“The so—called ‘steroid era,”’ Seligsaid,

' “is clearly a thing of the past, and Mark’s

admission today is another step in the right
direction.” -

Selig went on about the “toughest and
most effective” drug testing program in ma-
jor sports — one that doesn’t test for human

- growth hormone — and sang about how
_ baseball is all sunshine and triples now. ,

For howtough Selig’s magical lo'ck—tight
urine test supposedly is, I can’t help but

after Pete Carroll left Southern California to
coach the Seattle Seahawks, and after the
Packers and Seahawks scored a combined
96 points in an NFL playoff time. '
— Good timing, McGwire. On a one—to-10
scale of media frenzy, with Andre Agas_si’s

McGwire story clocked in around ﬁve or
six.

of the situation.

“Who decides what can be used and can’t -

be used?” Knight asked. “Gatorade is a per-
formance—enhancing substance  As far as
Mark is concerned, he should have been in
the Hall of Fame on the ﬁrst ballot.”

Human growth hormone enlarges the
heart, damages the liver and causes acro-
megaly, a condition that makes the jaw and
eyebrow bones jut out like a N eanderthal’s.
It’s also illegal. _

Gatorade comes in fruit punch and ﬁerce
grape. . ‘
“There’s not a pill or an injection that’s
going to give me — going to give any player
—— the hand-eye coordination to hit a’base—
ball,” McGwire told Bob Costas.

Human growth hormone, which the for-
mer St. Louis slugger admitted to taking,
improves eyesight.

Sammy Sosa and Rafael Palmeiro faded
from view after their 15 minutes of scandal '
ended. It takes a minute to remember Ja-
son Giambi.Jack Cust, Paul Lo Duca, Paul
Byrd and Eric Gagne were all named in the
Mitchell Report, the result of an investi-
gation into the steroid—addled world of
professional baseball, but I doubt anyone

Perhaps we’re just numb to it all now.

.BALCO was shocking. Barry Bonds domi-

Six years later, Alex Rodriguez showed it

V pariah to World Series hero.

Bonds himself will probably end up in
the Hall of Fame, with which voters will
rationalize their votes. '

“He probably was going to be a Hall of
Famer even without the steroids.”

Shoeless Joe Jackson still won’t be in

_ the Hall. '
