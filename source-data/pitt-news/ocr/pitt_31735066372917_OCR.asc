Board of Trustees Hike Tuition

By LARRY LEDERER

On May 12, Pitt's 60 member
Board of Trustees approved a
$319.3 million operating budget
for fiscal year 1983, contingent on a
Commonwealth appropriation as
recommended by Governor
Richard L. Thornburgh, of $78.2
million, an increase of 4.7 percent
over FY 1982. ‘ ‘

As a result, the majority of Pitt's
students will face an increase of
12.2 percent-—$240—for the next
school year, raising tuition from
$1,970 to $2,210.

The $240 increase applies to in-
state students in the Colleges of
Arts and Sciences and General Stu-
dies as well as Schools of Educa-
tion, Social Work and Information
Science and the Johnstown cam-
pus. Out-of-state students will pay
twice as much for these programs.

Also raised were the student
health fee——from $21 to $30 per
term.—and the student activity
fee—from $12 to $14 per term.

The budget is'7.8 percent higher

‘l6.4' percent—from $6,400

than last year's, a'nd'Pitt has raised
tuition 12 times during the last 12

. years.

Law students have the greatest
tuition increase, at 23.1 percent-
from $5,200 to $6,400—for out-of-
state students, though in terms of
actual dollars, dental students,

, both in-state and from other states,

face the largest hike. In-statedental
students will pay an increase of
to
$7,450——for two terms, and stu-

dents living outside of Pennsylva-‘

nia will see an increase of 15.5
percent—-—from $9,700 to $11,200.
First year in-state medical school
tuition has been raised 7.9 percent-
from $8,900 to $9,600—for two
terms, while their out-of-state
counterparts are faced with the
same percentage increase—from
$13,350 to $14,400. Second-year
medical students are the ‘only
group escaping tuition hikes as
third: and fourth-year student tui-
tion will be raised 6.3 percent for
in-state and out-of-state students.
Senior Vice Chancellor for

Administration jack E. Freeman
said tuition increases are needed
because the state's proposed allot-
ment is only 4.7 percent above last
year's.

“The costs of operating the uni-
versity have continued to rise as a
result of inflation...the recom-
mended state increase therefore
will not be sufficient for university
needs," Freeman said. “There will
be a $9.6 million compensation
increase to/help sustain competi-
tiveness of faculty and staff salaries,
offset the effects of inflation and
recognize merit and award
promotions.”

According to a statement
released by Chancellor Wesley W.
Posvar, the $9.6 million-—a com-
pensation increase of 7 percent over
FY l982—will be given to each
faculty and staff member whose
performance has been “satisfac-
tory" excluding those covered by a
collective bargaining agreement.

The statement said they should
receive a minimum salary increase
of 4.7 percent, “and the remaining

Renovation Onschedule

By CAROL KROWITZ

VSchenley Hall, Pitt's Student
Union, has seen many years since
its construction in 1897 and the
major renovation that it's presently
undergoing will allow it to see
many more.

Massaro Corporation is the
general contractor for this $13
million job, and according to
superintendent Pat Marino, plans
are right on schedule. Having

begun last winter, the completion"

date is set for November, 1983.

“We're completely gutting the
building from the first floor
through the seventh, partially
renovating the eighth and ninth
floors, and removing the entire
tenth floor," Marino said.
According to Marino, the tenth
floor was a later addition to the
building, and not sufficiently
supported to allow renovation.

The third and fourth floors will
be finished and ready for re-
occupation by June 1; the fifth,
sixth and seventh floors shortly
thereafter, _Marino said.

According to Andy Smith,
director of student activities,
everyone who is already in the
building will stay. The only new
addition will be the Office of
International Student Services,
which will move from Mervis Hall.
All student and student affairs
offices will be housed in the
building, Smith said, outlining the
general plan for occupation.

OThe first floor will be occupied
by the Office of Student Activities
and Off-Campus Housing. Several
other student offices and two large
meeting rooms will be added.

0 The Counseling Center,
Learning Skills Center, Placement
Office, Athletic Services and
Chaplains Association will be
located on the second and third
floors.

the fourth floor is The PittNews as

well as the other student media.

0 Three student governments-
Interfraternity Council (IFC),
Panhellenic Association and the

0 Moving to the seventh floor
will be the Office of International
Student Services, New Student
Projects, the judicial Office and
Special Student Services.

0  eighth and ninth floors
will house the math department.

Smith said an extensive lower
lounge is planned, offering a
variety of amusements from table
tennie to arcade games.

A cafe, based on the historical
theme of the building- is also
planned, and will have a seating
capacity of 200. Smith said a
concourse with the capacity to seat
another 200 people will be added,

funds in the 7 percent overall

, increase are to be used for equity
adjustments and to recognized
meritorious performance."

“This budget represents an
increase of just 7.8 percent in the
total budget, which is below the
rate of inflation. for the general
economy,” Posvar stated. “We
have realizedithis through careful
management of resources and exer-
cise of economies throughout the
university; to squeeze the budget
through...we have economized and
made the university more
efficient."

According to Posvar,‘The 4.7 per-
cent increase in the state's allot-
ment is a sign that,"‘given these
times, this level of funding does
represent recognition by the state
of a high priority for higher educa-

tion." However, Posvar, said, it is-

considerably below both the rate of

inflation and the level requested’by -

the university, .“’resulting in the
necessity to raise tuition again for
the coming year.”

Business

School  

By JEFF RUSSELL

It appears that construction of
Pitt's controversial iGraduate
School of Business building is
ready to begin.

Groundbreaking for the build-

A

ing, which is to be located south of '

Forbes Quadrangle on the corner
of Bouquet Street and Roberto Cle-
mente Way, might occur as soon as
next month according to Bernard
Kobosky, Pitt vice chancellor of
community affairs.

Kobosky stated that “we have
worked very hard to resolve our
problems” with the local commun-
ity and the local government
regarding the proposed facility.

According to Kobosky, opposi- 1.

tion to the building has disap-
peared for the most part. “It's all
over," he said.

Many South Oakland residents
opposed the construction of the
new building because of its effect

‘ on the B 8c 0 parkingilot near the

site. They were concerned about
possible parking'problems that
might arise due to the increased
demand for parking near the
building.

Kobosky said that “the issue was
painstakingly resolved through a
long series of.meetin _s, discussions
and public»\.,_lié_ar_i ,_ s” involving
Pitt, local citizen-s’ groups and

* Pittsburgh city council.

Pitt has agreed to irnprove the
size and the condition of the lot.

Kobosky said that Pitt needs the
new building for two reasons. The
first is there is no home for the
school. The second is that it would
be less expensive for Pitt to build a

new facility than it would be to‘

convert an existing building into a
suitable home for the school.

The building is expected to cost
approximately $6 million since the

Retirement Plan

' by ROCHELLE STEVWING

The new Faculty Early Retire-
ment Incentive Plan, drawn up by
a committee comprised of faculty
and administrators, will go into
effect July I, 1982.

The committee was co-chai.red
by Drs. Norman Mulgrave and
John Yeager.

As a result of a review conducted
by the Health and Welfare Com;
mittee(HWC) five years ago, many
questions were raised about the
university’s retirement plan.

Dr. Herbert Chesler, associate
professor of economics and now
chairman of the HWC, was among
those who questioned the old plan.

Chesler
wanted to shift away from the age’
linkage to retirement.‘ Another
plan was adopted in 1978; that
early retirement plan also had
built-in faults, according to
Chesler. '

A subcommittee was formed
three years ago to develop anew
retirement plan that would give
faculty more incentive to retire
early.

This is “one significant policy
that the faculty initiated and that
the administration came to accept
because they saw the advantages
that it offered to the institution,”
Chesler said. ‘

He said this new plan “has been
designed to foster intellectual rene-
wal within the university, provide
both increased opportunities for
promotion of younger
members and the flexibility to meet
emerging needs, of the faculty.”

Gives Incentive

A faculty member is considered
eligible for participation in the
plan if they have at least 10 years of
service and are at least 62 years of
age.

Once a faculty member is
accepted into the plan, they auto-
maticaily relinquish their tenure.

Two faculty
already signed up for the incentive
plan; they are: Dr. Ted Polk of the
School of Education and‘ Dr.
Daniel Cheever of the Graduate
School-of Public and International
Affairs.

Polk said he entered the plan
because it will enable him to keep
in line with the inflation rate for at
least the next four years.

He said‘ the administration
handled all of his questions as

.quickly as possible.

“It was a nice bit of personnel
cooperation,” Polk said. “Those
people (the administrators
involved in the plan) deserve a pat
on the back."

Faculty members will be assisted
in evaluating the incentives offered
in terms of their own interests,
goals and finances. '

“We took the initiative and
asked the university toconsider
financial counseling of faculty
who became eligible for the Early
Retirement Plan," Chesler
concluded. ,

The counseling services recom-
mended by the HWC were accepted
and will be -implemented this
summer along with the retirement
plan.‘

Women’s Center TO Close

By NATALIE FRIEDMAN

O

Pitt's Women’s Center may be
forced to curtail its services on June
30, /1982 due to the lack of funds.

This date is one year from the
university’s originally projected
closing date.

Since its beginning eight years
ago, the center was funded without
any problem, according to Cynthia
Vanda, the center’s director. Last
year university administrators
threatened to close its doors.

The center, located on Forbes
Avenue, was given an extension
one year ago as a result of consider-
able community and student sup-
port, according to Vanda. She said

that six weeks from the end of the

fiscal year and the proposed clos-
ing date,the center is faced with the
samg;,.situati'on. E

For the past year, the center has

had the task of raising approxi-
mately pne half (if its budget from
community resources, according to
Vanda. “This put us in a double
bind,” said one woman involved in
the center who asked not to be iden-
tified.\“We were told not to serve
the community as much but to go
to the community for funds."

The rationale behind the univer-
sity’s threat to close the center is
that the services offered by it are
duplicated elsewhere within the
university and that the center is not
central to the university's mission,
said Vanda. ,

According to Jean Markus, a
former intern at the center, a prop-
osal is being drawn up that would
give Vanda a new position.

“Although it is still unclear,”.

she said, “the position would
entail one of advocacy and an

_adviser on life-long learning for

women; ”

Resolution

  Adopted

Pittsburgh City Council
made the CBS Evening News on
April 19 when it adopted a reso-
lution calling for a multilateral
freeze on development of
nuclear weapons.

Dan Rather remarked that
with this action Pittsburgh
became one of the first large cit-
ies to join the freeze movement.

The resolution was passed
after a hearing on the effects of a
nuclear attack upon the city, at
which members of Physicians
for Social Responsibility,
testified.

The resolution .“urges Presi-
dent Reagan and Pittsburgh's
federal legislators to initiate
negotiations between the Uni-
ted States and the Soviet Union
and other nuclear powers to
mutually and immediately

; freeze development of addi-

tional nuclear weapons and to

— dismantle all nuclear arsenals,

for the future of mankind.”
On Thursday, May 20, from
10 a.m. to 3 p.m., members of

Study

  Presented

For years toothpaste
Inanufacturers have been
adding artificial sweeteners to
their products in the belief that
children. are _more likely to
brush regularly with sweet
tasting toothpaste. Now a study
recently completed at ~ the
University of Pittsburgh School
of Dental Medicine has found
that children have no
preference between sweetened'
and unsweetened toothpaste:
The results of the study
appeared in a recent issue of
“Clinical Preventive Dentis-
try.”

According to Daniel
Rinchuse, D.M.D., clinical
assistant professor of
orthodontics at Pitt's Dental
School, the study involved 62
sixth and seventh graders,’as
well as 24 female dental
hygienists. ,

“The testing included six
brands .of -commercial
toothpaste,” he said, “three
sweetened and three unsweet-
ened, or so-called ‘natural’
brands. We rotated the order in
which the six toothpastes were
tested and, of course, neither the
people administering the tests
nor the subjects knew which
toothpaste was being tasted."

After brushing, the subjects
rinsed their‘ mouths with tap
water, ate an unsalted cracker
and rinshed with tap'water
again’ before rating the
toothpaste on a scale from one

(very bad-terrible) to five (very

good-excellent).

   

According to Dr. Rinchuse,
the results showed that artificial
sweeteners had no statistically
significant effect on the taste
preferences of the children or
the hygienists.

"These results,". he " said,
“may indicate to toothpaste
manufacturers that the addition
of sweetening agents such as
sorbitol and saccharin may not
be necessary to appeal to the
consumer. It's important to
realize that research done in the
past at Pitt's Dental School has
indicated. that sorbitol and
other sweeteners may promote
tooth decay. So I think parents
should consider that their
children are no more likely to
brush their teeth with
sweetened toothpaste than with
unsweetened toothpaste. If

they’ll brush with unsweetened V

toothpaste, they might as well
avoid the sweetened brands and
their tooth decay-causing
additive." ’

Dr. Rinchuse and his
colleagues plan further research
on the subject of sweetened
versus unsweetened toothpaste.
In addition to manipulating
variables such as age, sex and
race, the researchers plan to test
additional toothpaste brands
and examine the effects that the
color of the toothpaste and the
time of day in which the
experiments take place have on
the subjects’ preferences. '

“ Whatever the results of these ~

future experiments,” said Dr.
Rinchuse, "it’s clear that
toothpaste makers as well as the
American public need to re-
evaluate some old assumptions
about artificially sweetened
toothpaste."

“We’re in the people business”
may sound like an ad for Ma Bell,
but ‘Director of Development and
Alumni Affairs Bernard Koperek
uses it to describe his job—what he
most enjoys doing—communi-
cating.

The amiable former Pitt honors
major served in a variety of positions
in development at Pitt until 1968
when he became the director of the
merged offices of the Annual Fund,
Development and Alumni Relations.

“I can’t say exactly why I was
hired,” Koperek explained,” but I
can say that after the chancellor,
then Dr. Fitzgerald, interviewed me
that they could have had me for
nothing.

‘‘I had just graduated when the
chancellor wanted to see me,” he

recalled. “The interview lasted for

about 20 minutes afterwhich I was
this high off the ground. I felt thatl
had reached a pinnacle,” he smiled,
“and higher education has been in
my blood ever since.”

In addition to raising funds for the
university, the office of. Develop-
ment and Alumni Affairs provides
services’ for the Pitt alumni popula-
tion and assists in conducting its
business, according to Koperek.

“The Association provides varied
social activities and reunions, and

Tl?B<Bilt.>N§msa Wed-nasrlavsl itrms;-t9s;l€82~i'z

we help to provide life-long, oppor-
tunity to retain friendships and asso-
ciations started at Pitt,” Koperek
said. “I think that we give something

meet, but over the years we lose
most of that—l hope that we pro-
vide the stimulus to recapture that.”
According to Koperek, there are
two requirements for his work:
being accepted as holding the values
of the community in which he deals,
and the ability to communicate.
He emphasized communication
as important because roughly 90
percent of all philanthropic dollars
are contributed by individuals, not
corporations. “It’s just people giving
to people,” he -said. ‘
Koperek said that his success in
attracting contributors is not a

reﬂection of the staff.

“Dollars don’t flow to need, they
ﬂow to strength. It's the more capa-
ble institution that gets the money,”
he said. -

“If one sees the good job that a
university has done producing good
students and fine research as Pitt
has, then the inclination is to sup-
port that institution and its pro-
grams,” he explained.

“Dollars don’t flow anywhere
unless there is a conduit through
which they can flow,” he added,
“and they flow to the institution that
provides the staff and . the

commitment.” ,

Koperek said that most taxpayers
feel good about supporting educa-
tion and that he does not expect
that to change.

“Few people could afford the total
cost of an education,” he said. “No
alumnus has really paid his freight-
unseen hands have offered the
needed assistance and maybe the
individual ought to think about
those coming up after him.

“I don’t think that there will be a
dramatic change in the amount con-
tributed in the future,” Koperek
said. “There is a slight trend downw-
ard, but it’s likely to stay at thep . g
ent level unless something drastic
happens to change it.” He said 2,000

\ ~ For Koperek, the job of communi-
cating and interacting with individu-
als is not all smiles and handshakes.

“You have to be people oriented,”
he admitted, “and even able to see
the opportunities for people to
create joy for one another, but com-

S munication requires labor ‘and
discipline—a willingness to
communicate.” I

He emphasized that he will talk to
anyone, because one way to learn
from people is to talk to them.

he said. “They have something to
tell you and they provide role mod-

people and the sum total of what
they've given me is what I’ve got.”

WPGH: Will

By WALTER R. WATSON

WPGH, Pitt’s student radio sta-
tion, could exist on the FM band
within the next l2 months.

It has taken five years of trials to
find a home for WPGH that would
make neighboring educational sta-
tions and the Federal Communica-
tions Commission (FCC) happy.

With an amendment to Pitt's
original June 1980 application
ready for the FCC, WPGH could

.”tceivably be an FM"entity by the
end of the 1982 fall term; '

Larry Lunsford, assistant direc-
tor of student activities’, media
adviser, and member of Pitt’s stu-
dent media and publications
board, has been involved in the
five-year struggle from the very
beginning. '

According to Lunsford, there is a
good chance that Pitt will become
more than just a carrier current sta-
tion, limited to the audience of
people on Pitt’s campus.

The propsed FM frequency of
98.5, and the periphery that
WPGH would reach—-a radius of
seven or eight miles from the

W lhedral of Learning——-are both
part’ of the -new proposal which
will be sent to the FCC within the
next two weeks, Lunsford said.

“The big reason for this problem
in becoming an FM station stems
from the fact that on the educa-
tional band, there was no room for
WPGH," He said. “In June 1980,
we filed for an FCC license, and
asked to be located at 88.1 on the
FM dial. We would have had trans-
mitter power of 300 watts with an
antenna on top of the cathedral.”

Because radio stations on the FM
band need to be distanced by four

' frequencies to minimize interfer-

ence between stations, Carnegie-
Mellon University's radio station,
WRCT, which is located at 88.3,

lﬂquld have had to relocate to 88.7

to allow WPGH the position of
88.], he said .

According to Lunsford, WRCT
made a verbal commitment three
years ago to WPGH which said if
Pitt provided all the moving
expenses—including a new trans-
mitter, antenna and the expense of
public announcements to inform
listeners that WRCT would be on a
new frequency—WRCT would
make the move. Pitt agreed to pay
those moving expenses.

Soon after, WCRT applied to
have its wattage increased from 10
to 100, boosting its transmitting
power and increasing its listener-
ship. At the same time, Bethany

I .=.,~‘§;,;;ge in West Va. had applied to

the FCC to increase the wattage of
its station, WBVC. The station
wished to reach the Pittsburgh lis-
tening audience, according to
Lunsford.

Faced with Pitt’s application to
have a new station on FM’s educa-
tional band (from 88.1 to approxi-
mately 92.1 on the FM dial) and
WRCT and WBVC attempting to

have their wattage increased, the
FCC ruled to freeze action on all
three applications.

The application for the new sta-
tion blocked any action that could
be taken to help the other two
schools. The only way to end the
deadlock would be through negoti-
ations, which have proved fruitless
for the past five years between
WPGH, WRCT and WBVC,
according to Lunsford.

If Bethany College's application
and Pitt’s application would have
been approved, Pitt and Bethany
would have been in conflict over
audience. .

“One of the suggestions we made
to Bethany was that they could
increase their wattage and send
their signal in one direction, as
opposed to in all directions. But
Bethany didn’t want any of this,”
Lunsford said. “WRCT didn't
want to hurt WQED either."

Lunsford said that the NBC-TV
affiliate in Johnstown, Pa. W]AC-
Channel 6, became part of the.

‘We’re amending
our original appli-
cation for the 88.]

waiver to their exist-
ing rules so we can
go on the commer-
cial band.’

frequency ‘ on cable television.
WJAC wanted to secure a place in
the Pittsburgh viewing market,
even though the education band
blocked the move.

“On their side is the National
Association of Broadcasters, which
presented the case of all Channel 6
stations across the country,” Luns-
ford said. “Apparently the same
problem here is cropping up all
over. What the association is ask-
ing the FCC to do is to redraft the
rules regarding Channel 6’s broad-
casting range and frequency.”

With theapplications of WRCT
and WPGH frozen, the three
schools met last summer to look at
alternative ways of handling the
problem.

Lunsford said that Bethany is no
longer frozen, and that if they can
work around the problem of Pitt
holding the position of 88.1 in- the
Pittsburgh area, the problem will
be just about solved.

But the biggest problem, he said,
with WBVC is to settle its dispute
before the redrafting of rules
regarding the VHF-Channel 6
range and frequency regulations by
the FCC.

Through the negotiations this
past January, Pitt has agreed to
apply for a position on the FM
commercial band.

Acceptance by the FCC would be

a precedent, according to Luns-
ford, but would more importantly
end the five year old battle.

WPGH would act as an educa-
tional, non-commercial FM sta-
tion and would sit at 98.5 on the
dial.

As current FCC rules stand, Pitt
is ineligible to go to the commer-
cial band, because it lacks an exist-
ing station on FM as opposed to
Carnegie-Mellon’s WRCT.

During the last negotiations,
Pitt offered WRCT the 98.5 posi-
tion and Lunsford said that they
indicated indirectly that they were
not interested in moving to the
commercial band.

“What we’re proposing -to the
FCC is that there is no difference in
who goes on the commercial band
between us and CMU, and since it
makes no difference, why notallow
us?" Lunsford said.

“We're amending our original
application for the 88.1 spot, ask-
ing a waiver to their existing rules
in order for us to go on the com-
mercial band, he said.

“If we do this, that is, if the FCC
permits us to do this, they will be
able to act on the applications of
Bethany College. At least we would
no longer be a problem to
Carnegie-Mellon,” he continued. .

“We are waiting for letters of
recommendation from the coun-
sels of Bethany and CMU suport-
ing our proposal to do this. They
should be here, ready to go to. the
FCC with our amendment within
the next week.”

It is Lunsford’s belief that the
amendment, prepared by Ed Perry
of Educational FM Consultants in
Duxbury, Massachusetts, has a
likelihood of passing.

Pery, who has a high success rate
in getting applications through
the FCC, was involved in drafting
the original application filed by
Pitt in 1977.

The new station would have a
listening radius between seven and

eight miles, originating from an-

antenna mounted atop the Cathed-
ral of Learning, according to a map
attached to the amendment.

“If CMU and Bethany are happy

that we’re doing this, and the FCC
accepts this request, there would be
a 30-day period for comments on
our application,” he said. “After
that, we will either be turned down
or approved. If we’re approved,
we’ll have a maximum of a year to
install the equipment needed to
run the new station on FM,"-Luns-
ford said.
I “The transmitter, the studios,
the control boards—everything—
will have to be in place within that
time. It's possible that we could go
on air in as short a period of time as
three or six months," Lunsford
said.

The FCC will be able to act on
Bethany’s request. However, CMU
still will be unable to get its wat-
tage increased, until the new rules
are drafted concerning the Channel
6 problem. This will happen only

if they accept the amendment. If
they don't, we are right back where
we started," Lunsford said.

“The radio station shouldn't get
its hopes up,” said WPGH's gen-
eral manager Darla Griffiths,

‘I’m really hesitant
about getting ex-
cited over it at this
point. It’s too early.
If it does go
through, it will be a
pleasant surprise.’

“because of the hearings the prop-
osal has to go throughﬁ.
Griffiths said that some changes
in the station’s format will be
noticed immediately in the music
format, where several free-form
shows will be replaced with “more
Top-40, more popular rock and
more pre-programmed selections.
Griffiths said that the station

would be included. A possible
addition would be a Spanish show
that would include news on hap-
penings in Latin American coun-
tries, music and activities
involving the Spanish speaking
community at Pitt, she said.

“With an open-air station, I
expect the number of people par-
ticipating at WPGH to double,"
Griffiths said. “We have roughly
30 people now, but we could possi-
ble have 60 to 90 people on staff.
Right now, I think there's an atti-
tude that says ‘Why even bother?
Such a small station, such a small
listenership.’ They think seriously
about not putting time into some-
thing that small."

“I'm ‘really hesitant about get-
ting excited over it at this point,”
she said. “It is too early. If itdoes go
through, it will be a pleasant
surprise."

Lunsford said that Perry, Pitt’s
consultant, and the attorneys at
CMU and Bethany are all
optimistic. . '

“Their attorneys are based in
Washington, D.C. Our consultant
works on agreements and propos-
als with the FCC allthe time. They

Tuition Hiked

.continued from page one

‘‘I would like to point out we
should all fully understand this is
not a university policy to...increase
tuitions—-it is a reluctant univer-
sity decision which is proposed by
state policy,” Posvar said. “We
have to strain in every possible
way...we're doing the best we can
and we know it’s not good enough,
but we will continue to fight the

A lone vote was cast against the
tuition hikes by Alfred E. Lawson.
It is the third year in a row he voted
against tuition hikes. Lawson was
concerned that Pitt may only, in
the future, be accessible to the rich._

He produced figures showing
that Pitt, out of 165 public colleges
and universities has the third high-
est tuition, and that Pennsylvania
holds the bottom position regard-
ing high school graduates attend-
ing public colleges. He also
pointed out that Pennsylvania
ranks among the lowest in appro-
priations for higher education.

“I wonder about our priorities,”
Lawson said. “This university
might consider operating on a
deficit basis.”

State Representative K. Leroy
Irvis, D-Oakland, who is also a
trustee, said, however, “It would be
absolutely disasterous for this uni-
versity to even attempt to operate
on a deficit budget. To even con-
sider it (could lead to) inflamma-
tory attacks such as you haven’t
witnessed in 20 years."

Will students have enough
financial aid next fall? Posvar said
the administration is against any
proposed cutbacks in student aid,

“because we agree this is a very

high priority."

  Put your
money where
your_Heort

IS.

‘‘I would hazard to say the
increase in funding...to support
student aid have come very close to
covering the increases in tuition
that have occurred over the last sev-
eral years. We are very concerned
about this, of course, and we will
do the best we can,” Posvar said,
“Within this university, we give
massive support to student aid of
all kinds, and our budget of the
total university as reflected in our
budget of some $26 million and
other forms of student aid will
bring this figure well over $40
million.”

Vice Chancellor Freeman
pointed out the total budget
“reflects careful balancing of insti-
tutional needs and priorities in the
face of diminishing con-
straints...(The budget) is consistent
with policy to hold tuition at a
reasonable level, while sustaining
the high quality of the university.”

Although Freeman said he
“deplores" the need to raise tuition
again, “we believe it is necessary to
maintain the quality of the aca-

‘ demic program and to offset» the

erosion of faculty and staff income
due to inflation.” '

“To finance the $13 million ren-
ovation of Schenley Hall to pro-
vide a modern and complete
student union, annual debt service
will be increased $600,000 to $2.4
million, despite the university's
best efforts to hold down expendi-
tures and increase other sources of
revenue," Freeman continued.
“The effects of inflation coupled
with a modest increase in state
appropriation, the additional $1.8
million in service for the student
union will require increases in stu-
dent tuition in order to achieve a
balanced budget."

Nuclear
Movement

.43.

Involving
Church

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

The subject of the church's rela-
tionship to the anti-nuclear move-
ment was addressed by University

._ cture held earlier this week.

“When we’re talking about‘
peace in the church,” White said,
displaying a “Bread not Bombs"
button on _the lapel of his jacket,
“we’re talking about a long, rich
history.” .

According to White, the Radical
Reformation of the 16th century
forbade Christians to s'erve in the
army, and punishment was excom-
munication from the church.

Throughout the years, the
church had three ideologies con-
cerning war: pacifism, the just war
theory (the basis of which is con-
flict for just and restored peace

with no wanton violence) and the
Qsade (God wills it) philosophy ,
White said. _

In recent years, however, the
church has separated itself from
military affairs. The great theolo-
gians of the twentieth century lived
in Germany, yet they never
addressed the problem of the geno-
cide of the Jews, said White.

“You still have the perspective
that the church stays out of state
politics and the state staysout of
the church,” White said.

White finds that the church just
isn’t able to make a marked impact
concerning the issue of nuclear
arms.

“(Many religious leaders) simply
don’t have the integrity and they

. ion’t have the guts to stand up for
“wfihai they believe is right," White

said.
“The reason the church doesn’t
have much influence is that

nobody cares on some level,” said
Chuck Lidz, associate professor of
psychiatry and sociology. .

“On the one hand, sociologists
tell usthat of all the countries in
the‘ world, the United States is
clearly the most religious,” sociol-
ogy professor John Marx said. “On
the other hand, the religious pro-
fessionals have been anti-war, but
it doesn't seem to have made any
impact on the country as_a whole.”

Marx cited studies that show that
religious participation (going to
.éf“‘\trCh or believing in God) on the
 ‘of military leaders is very high.

, “My suspicion is that most mil-

My suspicion is thatmost mit-
itary people who attend a particu-
lar church are very selective about
that church because it presents a
theological model that is similar to
their own," White said.

White is not completely pessi-
mistic about the situation. He is
encouraged by the reaction of
Catholic bishops to the subject and
describes the role they play in
nuclear disarmament as “critical.”

“They listen to bishops when it
comes to the Catholic church,"
White said, “and it's making an
'mpact."

* Another stand that White dis-
cussed was the pro-nuclear arms
opinion—the “sooner the better”
idea that the way to fight “godless
communism" as well as encourage
the second coming of Christ is to
“push the button.”

«:1;

_ “There are a lot of people who
hold a lot of power who have that
apocalyptic vision,” White said.

White, as well as millions of oth-
ers throughout the country, is very
concerned about the situation, and
fears that things may result in the
use of nuclear weapons.

to get there, will utilize the tran-
script for two purposes: one is vali-
dation, two, planning activities for
the next four years,” Giangarlo
said.

The student development pro-
gram, initiated a year ago, is availa-

ble to all undergraduates for a $4 ’

fee, though the program’s focus
has been primarily on freshman,
according to Giangarlo. The office
of student activities, in turn, pro-
vides an official embossed record of
the students co-curricular campus
involvements that the student can
present to graduate school admis-
sion committees or potential
employers at the end ‘of four years,
she said. '

The transcript views four main

areas: leadership activities, profes-
sional and educational develop-
ment, honors, awards and
recognition and membership in an
organization requiring sustained
participation, she said

The transcript will list each
activity, describe the purpose of the
organization and the individiual
role of the student played.

To participate in the program,
students must complete and return
the student developrrient transcript
application with permission cards
to the office of student’ activities
with the fee. An instruction book-
let is then given to the student. As
he or she begins participating in
various activities, verification
forms found in the booklet are
filled out and returned to the office
where the information will be kept
on permanent file.

Although co-curricular activi-
ties could be included on a resume
with an appropriate spot for it,
Giangarlo said, the student devel-
opment transcript is more profes-
sional looking and formal; it's a
very positive statement.

Adding activities onto the tran-
script that are not university-
related will depend on whether
those things can be verified by the
office, Giangarlo said. The deci-
sion also has to be made as to

whether it's more suitable on a
resume as an unpaid work expe-
rience, for instance, or an out-of
-class activity, she said.

“Piles and piles of validation
entries have been coming in from
freshman right now who signed up
last summer,” Giangarlo said. “We
want to get all the students as
broad-based as we canto get them
where they want to go. If they have
an end career in mind, then we
need to start planning activities to
fit that end, so it's validation as
well as aplanning tool and I think
freshman are starting to realize
that.

“lt’s all very nice that you're sit-
ting there in class going through
the typical lecture-testing model,
but through the activities you par-
ticipate in, you’re also learning as
much about your behavior interac-
tionwith other people, and the
mechanics of the organization,”
she said. "We're saying that we can
prove that our students are learn-
ing, and we'll keep track of it
enough so that when students are
ready to graduate, they can utilize
it.”

Because of privacy rights, the
transcripts are only released ‘by the
students permission, and are never
directly sent to employers or gradu-

gate schools, added Giangarlo.

    Nuclear
Awareness  
0r  Hysteria?

“The living will envy the dead.” _(
_ That quote, attributed to Soviet leader Leonid‘
Brezhnev, is quickly becoming a household phrase.

Nuclear awareness——or hysteria, depending on
your point of view—tseems now to be reaching a‘
peak. ’ ‘ .
At Pitt, there is the Arms Race Study group, a
faculty and student coalition opposed‘ to the use -of
nuclear weapons. Although the group was estab-

lished only this year, it has already acquired a stable ’

following and‘ has sponsored a series of informative

lectures featuring such speakers as Sam Day, editor a

of Progressive Magazine. A ~ \
Also, the Progressive Student Network, although
younger than the Arms Race group, held weekly
meetings last term" to discuss the subject. ~
In Harrisburg, voters took to the- polls to decide
whether to re-start the reactor at ThreeMile Island.
And in Washington, a study by by the Carnegie
Endowment. for International Peace termed Presi-
dent Reagan’s proposal for opening strategic arms
reductions talk “very useful and serious."

The rising concern is quite understandable, espe- , ‘ ’

cially considering the mounting hostilities between
the world's superpowers, the presence of a generally
hawkish US. administration and the prevailing
belief. among Americaris, at least according to the
la_test Associated Press poll, that we would not sur-
vive a nuclear war. I - I

The government, however, is not unaware of all
this. It has provided a plan for “crisis relocation”
that would tell Americans what to do in case of a
nuclear attack. ’ ‘- * ‘

judging whether such a plan would be realistic or
not is fairly simple. \ » V

Consider: “ .

0 It assumes we would have three or four days
notice of an attack;

0 People would be told to pack up and head
directly out of the cities; I ' V . A

0 However, if you don't have a car, you must wait
for public transportation to get out, or depend on a
friend. _ an ’

“Good idea, dumb plan,"_ is how one “60 Min-
utes” listener described the proposal aftera story had
been done on it. I - -

Thegrowing awareness of nuclear danger could i

turn into hysteria. But it is certainlyiless than reas-
suring to hear of a nuclear attack-

Perhaps if Washington were to think about, and
plan realistically for, a nuclear attack, the hysteria’
might be lessened. - V

Dear Editor:

The faculty and administrators.
of the‘ School of Medicine suffer
collectively a confusion of
purpose; they have lost sight__of the
fact that their primary responsibi-
lity is to train medical students as
best they can. This institutional
goal should be taken even more
seriously than ever before, for Pitt
students ‘are now paying the
highest tuition of any state-related
school in the country.. .

Only last‘ year the prestigious
Liason Committee on Medical
Education (LCME) sent Pitt a
strong signal in the form of a
devasting evaluation of the
medical school that provided the
basis for limiting accreditation to
only three years.

The message of the LCME site
visit team was clear; put medical
students back into the equation at
Pitt. But how effectively has the
School of Medicine reacted to this
advice? Rather than listen to the
ever upbeat administrators, let us
consider ‘the medical student
perspective.

‘ An‘ unprecedented number (l7)~

of freshmen medical students just
failed one of the core basic science
courses. No other department in
the School of Medicine has ever
failed so many students. Of course,
the faculty blame the students and
disclaim any responsibility for
these failures by claiming this
year's freshman class is lazy,
inesponsible and the worst one in
decades.

To further prove the point, the
same department refused to award
a single “honors" grade. What

A arrogance to conclude that not one

existance until they reach the end
of Year II.‘

How many suicides, broken
marriages and mental illnesses are
we promoting among this high-
risk population? Perhaps some
psychiatrist or epidemiologist will
seize this rare opportunity and
tarry out a prospective study of Pitt
medical students.

There are other signs of serious
student malaise. With graduation
day approaching and students in a
reflective mood, one frequently
hears a senior volunteer that they

will never donate so much as one ‘

dime to the University of Pitts-
burgh. This position is taken even
by those on government scholar-
ships‘ who argue that the medical

‘ school has forgotten,_ the students

and become insensitive to their
problems.

Faculty members are rushing

about optimizing their financial

gains (thanks to the Practice Plans)
and pursuing their ego trips,
regardless of how seriously these
trips drain the limited resources of
the Health Center. '

,‘ One has only to peek in on a

lecture in the psychiatry course to ‘
see

that‘ there is a problem;
attendance rarely exceeds 25
percent and frequently there are
only 15 students in attendance.
And this has been the situation for
at least 10 years. Even the LCME
report underscored the need for
marked improvement in this area-.
But nothing has changed. Where is
the dean or the Curriculum
Committee?

Most faculty members dismiss

the signs and symptoms of ‘stress ‘

-and dissatisfaction amongmedical
students by arguing simply that the

medical school failed" again and

However, it is not the medical
students who are changing; the
freshman class contains bright,

young people filled ‘with idealism

faculty who have changed;

a In the face of a decade of weak,
‘leadership with unclear-*

ambiguous goals for the medica 

school, the needs and concerns of
students have somehow gradually

 drifted out of the field of vision of

the faculty and administrators.

When the patient isn't doing
well it is easy to blame the poor
performance and low attendance
and general‘ malaise of medical
students. on the failures of a careless
admissions committee. '

Withholding honors grades and
failing dozens of students does not
prove that the problem lies with
them. Nor does characterizing
them as lazy and dishonest.

It is time for the deans and
professors to‘ acknowledge that
something is seriously wron 
the School of Medicine, and’ tha
we—not the students——are largely

Text books and lectures are only one aspect of learning;
another is the interaction and communication between people
from different backgrounds.  

An idea sparked by a sentence, a conversation or a meeting
with someone holding a different viewpoint is equally impor-
tant in gaining knowledge.  

  The University of Pittsburgh has students from 105 different

countries representing hundreds of languages and cultures.

 z T According to Julie Slim,» a Lebanese student featured inside,
“Most people avoid you if you’re foreign. They hear your
accent and are interested in you for about five minutes.” V

‘ Despite this attitude, the Inside Story believes along with

a true gift.   * .. . ,   .

Claude Sooprayen

Claude Sooprayen, an instructor
and graduate student at Pitt and

- president of the Graduate Profes-
sional

and Student Association
(GPSN), is a native of Mauritius

 Island, located in the middle of the I

Indian Ocean between South Africa
and Australia.

Because of its central location,
people from all over the world visit
Mauritis. M

, “Ships must refuel there because
it’s on the way to the Antarctic, Aus-

 V tralia, Japan, Korea, China, Singa-

pore and Hong Kong. All countries
which trade with Europe and .South
Africa must go through; they’ve
been doing it for centuries,” said
Sooprayen.

Until recently, Mauritius had

I  good relations with the U.S. Soop-

rayen_, also aformer assistant secre-
-tary in the Ministry of Foreign

Affairs dealing with the Middle East ’

and the’ UN, said, “right now, the
people in“ my country are not happy
with the Americans, ‘because they
have taken the island of Diego Gar-

cia over as a naval base.

“We have. always thought that
using the island for a naval base

could be justified, but the push for - ‘

nuclear armaments there cannot.”
He adds that although it is not
known if nuclear weapons are situ-

ated on Diego Garcia, Mauritius has _

“asked for a US-Soviet—European
commitment not to use nuclear

7 weapons, because if one does,the
_ others will follow. We have asked

the Americans .to agree not to build
armaments there as long as the Rus-
sians don’t, but so far they havenot
agreed to this.”

Another indignity that Sooprayen
believes his people have suffered is

that “23,000 inhabitants of Diego

Garcia were sent back to Mauritius,

and never received compensation.”

Working’ in conjunction with the
political sciepce department,
GPSA, and Senator John Heinz of
Pennsylvania, Sooprayen hopes to
introduce the question of compen-
sation in Congress. He is presently
in the process of preparing the doc-
uments to be sent to the Senate.

Sooprayen believes that “the
American public is unaware of this

‘ problem,” and hopes to increase the

public’s awareness‘ through his
activities at Pitt. \ I

Sooprayen came to Pitt after
meeting a professor in Africa who
needed a French-speaking instruc-
tor to prepare a seminar at Pitt. The
seminar, which will be held in June,
is mostly for African administrators
who don’t speak English and will
receive their education in French.

Once Sooprayen was at Pitt, he
enrolled as a student in order to
pursue a Ph.D. in public administra-
tion. He later became president of
GPSA.

Because he has t.rav.elled..and
lived all over the world, Sooprayen
has had little trouble adjusting to the
States.

However, he  “life\in.Pitts- . ‘ After livin9.-here\f9r two years. ‘.

\

burgh is similar to living in a small
town.” He said that people in Pitts-
burgh are “not interested in outsid-
ers. They don’t have to relate to
them Because there are enough
insiders to stay to themselves?”

According to Sooprayen, “when
you are in a big city, wherever you
go, social contact is easy because
everyone is foreign. People are cur-
ious about you, even though the
relationship may not go far.

‘‘In a small village, it’s the same
way. You have to break the ice, but
once you deal with the difficulties,

‘ everyone is understanding.”

“It is important to develop rela-
tionships with people from other
countries, because otherwise no
exchange occurs.”

He‘ added, “the reason we go
back to school is for these
exchanges; if we are closed off, we
are not being educated.

“Groups of foreigners have a lot
of experience to exchange with
young Americans.” Sooprayen
believes, nonetheless, that “we for-
“eigners don’t learn enough.”

While he has had both formal edu-

cation‘ and job experience, Soop- "

rayen believes his “whole education
is through meeting people. ‘

“More important than seeing the
beauty of a foreign country, is the
people——the way they live, the way
they deal with things,” said
Sooprayen. _ r '

-Since many visitors pass through
his country, Sooprayen has “always
had relationships with foreigners.”

He wishes that Americans would
not close themselves off.

“If you are not able to capture
little, things, details about people,
you have nothing.”OO'O '

 

Keith Jubah

eith Jubah a Liberian graduate
student in chemical engineering,
believes there isa close relationship
between people in America and
those in Liberia.
“Liberia is the only country in
Africa built 'by free black Ameri-
cans,” said Jubah.

America’s influence in Liberia is.

easily seen. According to Jubah,
“Ninety-five percent of the culture
and education in Liberia is Ameri-
can with that of Puerto Rico, but
emphasized the fact that Liberia is
independent.

In discussing how Liberians view
America, Jubah said “they believe
that the society here is not as close
as in my country, which is one of the
reasons for the high crime rate."

He said that Liberians believe
“everybody in America has every-
thing, meaning all the advantages,
especially wealth.

' “People in other countries might
not be lucky enough to have things
like food and medicine.”

Jubah finds America much as he
perceived it to be before coming

here, “but not to the extent people .

see it back home.”

He adds that although he can’t
draw generalized conclusions (Pitts-
burgh is the only U.S. city he has
visited)’, “people are more conserva-

tive when dealing with people from -

the outside than in Liberia. They’re
not open.

“It’s not ‘ easy socially here
because people are not willing to
accept others,” said'Judah. But he
continued “once you make your way
through and get more accustomed
to society, things get better.”OOO

 

  
 
    
 
    
 

Debasish Chakraborty

- India has much in common with
the United States, according to
Debasish Chakraborty, an Indian
graduate student in economics.

“We have tha same sort of prob-
lems as you have here, but here they
are less in magnitude because of the
level of development,” said
Chakraborty.

India suffers from unemployment,
inflation and poverty—problems
that‘ have all plagued the U.S.,
according to Chakraborty.

“The effect of inflation and unem-
ployment is much worse in India
than the U.S.A. because of the level
of development. While in the U.S.
people don’t feel the pressure of
these, in India it is a matter of survi-
val,” he said. .

According to Chakraborty, 60
percent of India’s population is
below the poverty line and couldn’t
have “at least one square meal per
day.”

“They have a lot of dreams about
the U.S. Most aren’t as true as they
think,” said Chakraborty. I

To him, the United States has
been a welcoming place, Chakra-
borty said.

“I teach a lot of courses here, and
I feel the students accept me here. I
don’t have a lot of problems fitting
in. It’s a pretty open and accepting
society. You don~’t,fell inferior here,”
according to Chakraborty.

‘‘I think that if there was a choice
between the United States and
Europe, (most Indians would)
choose America. They believe it has
a lot to offer, said Chakraborty.OO

Anh Duong

Anh Duomg is practically a native
American, after having moved to
the U.S. from Vietnam when she
was 13.

A sophomore nutrition major,
Duomg said that the Vietnamese
people “appreciate the Americans
somewhat for our position now and
the situation we were in. Because of

“them, we had the opportunity to

make a. living and a life for
ourselves.”
According to Duomg, the people

/

in her country “think” that Ameri-
cans are very free,” and she agreed.
“If you’re a girl, you can say any-
thing, or if you’re a minority, it’s not
a problem.”

When she first came here in 1975,
Duomg was /unacquainted with the
American lifestyle. “At first, it was a
lot of luxury and totally different
life.” she said.

However, she added that
although “materialistically it still
meets my expectations, life here is
just as hard‘ as anywhere else. The
only thing that’s different is that you
do have opportunities.”

Duomg said that a common reac-
tion of people adjusting to a new
country is to “get discouraged and
go back to the Vietnamese com-

’ munity.” She emphasized the need

for communication.

Socially,’ Duomg found that ‘‘peo- '

ple are very niceand friendly, proba-
bly because I came here very early.

“I adjusted to society myself; peo-
ple won’t adjust for you,” She said.
‘‘I have had no problems with the
people or my teachers.”.Qo

   

Jeremy Jacobson

America should lend Britain
moral and logistical support as well
as honor the European,Common
Market sanctions against Argentina
in the war for the Falkland Islands,
according to Jeremy'Jacobson.

A native of Britain, Jacobson is

. currently a doctoral student in

Spanish literature at the University
of Pittsburgh.

“But I don’t think the us. should‘

get militarily involved. It’d be wrong
if they did,” said Jacobson.

Jacobson, who said. he relies on
newspapers for much of his informa-
tion concerning Great Britain and
Argentina, believes that the history
of the twentieth century points to
the common interests of British and
American foreign-policies.

“Britain and the U.S. have been
working together. They have inter-
ests in common. I think Americans

» feel as at home in Britain as the Brit-

ish feel in America,” said Jacobson.

While Britain and the United
States don’t share a common cul-
ture, they do share a common herit-
age, according to Jacobson. '

Overall, Jacobson said, the Brit-
ish “tend. to support American pol-
icy when they don’t see it as siding
with right-wing dictators. They don’t
see why America should be shoring
up dictators like the right-wing
government in El Salvador.”

The British battle to retain the
Falkland Islands. isn’t imperialistic,
according to Jacobson.

“I think that Britain has an impe-
rial past and it is now living out its
post-imperial history,” said
Jacobson.

The Argentinian claim of British
imperialism is rhetoric, according to
Jacobson. I ., -- I

/

“It’s not a case of imperialism.’ I '_=
Latin America. In Latin America, if i

you use the word “colonialism,” it
sets off a string of reactions.”

Jacobson likened the situation to
the Communist Scare in America in
the 19505. “If you said the word
“communist,” you'd get much the
same reaction.”

Jacobson believes the claim to,
imperialism applies to Argentina.”
After all the people on the Falklands
are British. It’s Argentina who’s
invading. . I

“If you start talking colonialism,
you’d' have to say Latin~America
didn’t originally belong to the Span-
ish, it belonged to the Indians,”
according to Jacobson.

\~4

Falklanders, however, said Jac- "I

obson, have been living on the
Islands for 150 years and “have
killed no Indians.”

According to Jacobson, if Britain
were politically concerned about its
empire, there would have been wars
to retain other British interests,
such as Kenya and Nigeria.

The Falklands crisis is, according
to Jacobson, “just a case of Britain
not accepting the aggression.”

And, he said, a case of national
pride. . i _ a

“We might not be the world

power we used to be, but we're not

going to let this happen,” said
Jacobson. -

The British government, accord- ,
ing to Jacobson, 'doesn’t see 
overly concerned with the Russian

annoncement that the extended
war zone is illegal. .

‘‘They’re. not particularly upset
about it.’ Britain, as a. NATO
member, expects \the Soviets to
make trouble wherever they can.”

The Russians also have a major
interest in Argentina. “They signed
a pact with Argentina concerning
the krill around the Falklands.‘lf Bri-
tain regains" the islands, the Rus-
sians won’t be able to harvest the
krill_””

Krill are minute crustaceans and
larvae‘ that are high in protein and
thought to be a solution forworld
hunger. _, ‘J ‘

Another reason for Soviet ,s_ I “-
port for the Argentines is the con-
cern over the Soviets image,
according to Jacobson.

“After invading Afghanistan, Rus-
sia is trying to improve its image with
the third world,” said Jacobson. ,

“Also, Russia isn’t going to like
any member of NATO throwing its
weight around,” according to
Jacobson.

Jacobson believes Britain isn’t
necessarily the superior military
force, however.

“After all, Argentina has its whole
air force and two very modern Ger-
man submarines,” said Jacobson.

Britain has only its ships and a
limited air force, according to
Jacobson. ’ -

“The other problem is the sea and
the weather. The Argentines can go
home. The British can’t,” according
to Jacobson.

The problem won’t simply be
decided by war, Jacobson said.

“The trouble is it’s not just a vic-
tory for one side or the other.”
According to Jacobson, control of
the islands will still have to be
solved.

“As far as Britain is concerned, if
they get the islands back, they just
have to decide what to do with

them. Even if Argentina doesn’t own

the islands, they’ll never give
claiming them.

“If and when Argentina does get

the islands, they'll learn that their
countries problems won’t be solved ’
by having the Falklands,” Jacobson »
said.OOO 2 . I r

 

 

 

Antonio Perez Mata

Anti—Americanism is on the rise in
Latin American countries, accord-
ing to Antonio Perez Mata.

Perez, a recent Ph.D. in econom-
ics, Latin American studies and edu-
cational planning, believes the
Reagan Administration’s support of

U.S. image in Latin America.

“Anti-Reaganism, a more approp-
riate term for anti-Americanism, will

« continue to rise in Latin America. It

does not help the image’ of the Uni-
ted States to‘ support govemments
like the one in El Salvador,_ where

 -. «game like Mayor D_’Aub.usion have

b e ome central ﬁgures, ‘despite
their link to death squads and
extreme right-wing groups,”
according to Perez. '
The administratiorfs decision to
side with ‘Great Britain over the
Falkland Islands dispute further tar-
nished the American reputation in
Latin America, according to Perez.
“In this case, the U.S. didn’t just
abstain, but sided with Britain
against Argentina,” Perez said, des-
pite the fact the Rio de Janeiro pact
was approved by a majority in the
Organization of American States.
Perez believes that while “maybe,
in a broader picture of international
relations, England is more impor-

 .,t to the US. as a NATO ally”,

rg ntina was also “a loyal friend to
the United States.”

“President Galtieri of Argentina is
considered one of the most pro-
American presidents this country
has had,” noted Perez‘.

He believes that most “Latin
Americans wish the United States
could go back to its initial position”
as‘ an impartial mediator in the
dispute, . _

“But it’s probably too late. Defi-
nitely the Soviet-backed groups
who work making politics in Latin
America will capitalize from the Mal-
vinas Islands crisis,” according to
Perez.

The Soviet-backed groups, Perez‘ .'
' id, will show the world that the

United States pulls out on its friends
when they need help.

“They’ll show that the U.S. is not
a reliable partner,” according to
Perez. ’

As long as the Reagan administra-
tion doesn’t“take seriously the legit-
imate claims of Latin-American
governments,"
will continue to rise, Perez said.

-. “Latin Americans in general like-
, the American people, American ‘
style, American way of life. But they

don’t like the way a particular presi-
dential administration handles its

-. ‘ Vﬁreign policy in the region,” accord-

, to Perez. T
Jimmy Carter’s administration

‘ had greater- credibility Latin Ameri-

cans, according to Perez.
- “When Carter was president, the
U.S."gained-a lot in prestige in Latin

anti-Americanism '

America by treating the Latin-
American countries with respect.
He gained the battle in Congress to
give back the Panama Canal and
allowed the Nicaraguans the human
right of self-determination. They
could choose the type of govern-
ment they wanted,” according to
Perez. "
Carter became well-known as the
champion of human rights in Latin
America, according to Perez.
“When President Reagan took
office, the State. Department
declared that human rights was not
an issue for foreign policy. This
became, right away, bad news for
the millions of people who live under
repressive regimes in Latin Amer-
ica,” Perez said. 000

Aly EI_-Shikhaby

Hideo Takemura

I Aly ‘El-Shikhaby, ' an_ Egyptian
graduate, student in education,
believes most of his countrymen

have mixed feelings about the»

United States,’ its culture and its
people. '

“Some Egyptians‘ (see US.
policy) as imperialism because we
have suffered from it so long,” said
El-Shikhaby. 1

According to El-Shikhaby, what
most Egyptians fear is U.S.
interference in their co_untry’s
affairs. ”

x “In the 1970s, many were afraid
of the United States. There were
many Americans in Egypt,” said El-

Shikhaby. _
Others like Americans. ' When
Americans are in Egypt,

'El—Shikhaby believes, they find help

and assistance wherever it’s
needed. 4 -

. “Egyptians help not only
Americans—any foreign person.
When they find out he’s a foreigner,
they try to help. Here I've found
American students who try to help
me,” said El-Shikhaby. .

“Me, as an Egyptian, I‘ like
Americans. I like their organi-
zations. They’re honest, especially
in their jobs. - '

“I like their freedom in everything
except in sexual relationships. As a
Moslem, I don’t like this.”

Afproblem El—Shikhaby has,
however, is the extent to which he
says Americans believe in the
media.

“Most Americans usually listen to
their official radio and T.V. and they
accept what (the media) is saying.
When. the television says Egypt is
bad, ‘they think Egypt is bad.
Television doesn’t show anything
good. American T.V. is bad for
foreign countries."

Another problem El-Shikhaby
said Americans have is an ignorance
about his religion.

“They usually talk bad about my
religion. You talk about Islam and
they ask,—‘.l-low.  (10,900

have?’ ”

Overall, however, El-Shikhaby
said he likes the U.S. especially, “the
Americans who respect me.
Anyone, really, who respects me, I
respect him.

“Egyptians as individuals like any
man‘ or person who can respect
their affairs,” said El-Shikhaby.OO

 

   
 

“The Japanese believe Ameri-
cans are the best friends in the
world,” said Hideo Takemura, a
Ph.D_. student in higher ‘education.
“We believe it’s very important both
economically and socially.”

Even though Japan is very wes-
ternized, there are differences
between Japan and the U.S.

“The Japanese people respect

their elders. They are very heavily
group-oriented,” unlike Americans,
who are seen by theJapanese as
“more individualistic. People here
respect individuality.”

Takemura pointed out one of the
things Japanese people especially
like about the U.S. “To a Japanese
person, the three best things in the
world are Chinese food, an Ameri-
can house, and a Japanese wife.”

He also explained some of the
current attitudes and controversies
in Japan, and from where they
stemmed.)

“In the 1960s, there was heavy
student dispute throughout Japan,
similar to what was occuring in
America. Students were._against
U.S. foreign policy. The U.S.-

Japanese Security Treaty was-

signed, but believe it or not, stu-
dents were against renewing it.”

He said that the reason for stu-
dent disapproval was that “article
nine of the Japanese constitution
stated that Japan couldn’t have any
armies, navies, or air forces.”

‘ In the 1970s, “the Japanese peo-
ple were more understanding of the
value of the treaty,” he said. Now,
because of Russia’s aggressiveness,
other communist countries’, Japan
and Reagan’s request for a stronger
Japanese defense force, Japan is in
trouble. We want to have stronger
defense for protection, of course,
but it’s against the constitution.”

Even the Japanese national
defense force, which is similar to the
United States’ National Guard,
doesn't escape criticism;

“Some people say that even this is
against the constitution,” said
Takemura. “Japan now is in the
midst of a turning point over
whether or not the constitution
should be changed.”

Takemura said that Japan's big-
gest fear is of a Russian invasion.

“They still occupy four Japanese I

islands, which are important for ‘Jap-
anese fishery. They won’t givethem
back because Japan is friendly with
the US. They ‘put troops, missiles



Photos by Weinschenker and Sheer I

and" heavy armaments there and are
‘ready to attack Japan.” .

Takemura said that statistics
show “it would only take two hours
to destroy Japan. The U.S. would
probably be willing to help, but it
might be too late.”

He added he respects the consti-

tution, but believes “Japan has to
build some more appropriate
defense to protect the country. This
is a very sensitive subject in Japan
right now.”
‘ Takemura described culture
shock upon his arrival in the US. in
1977. He left his wife at home and
went to California State College of
Pennsylvania, ‘where he received an
MS. in geography.

Takemura found the dormitory
quite agreeable, unlike most Ameri-
can college students. “People were
very friendly,” he siad. He added
that he didn’t have many problems
dealing with people.

’ “The undergraduates in -the dor-
mitory ‘were the best English
teachers; they taught me conversa-
tional English and slang,” he said

“The dormitory is the best place to _

learn about American culture and to

"understand each other.” "9

 

1 Matthew Ajibero

\ After a nine-year military rule in
Nigeria ceased in September 1979,
Nigeria adopted a presidential sys-
tem of government tailored after the
United States, according to Mat-

. thew Ajibero, a doctoral student in

library science." ,

“This was a new system in Nige-
ria. In November (1979), a commit-
tee had to visit America to modify
the system to fit Nigeria,” said
Ajibero.

Since then, Nigeria has regularly
sent it‘s‘“l’egislators and senators to
the United States to study the
American political system.

“We (Nigerians) don’t have a bias I

against America. My government
just wants America to help in the
apartheid policy_ in South Africa,
which we are totally against. We see
that America can inﬂuence that pol-
icy_,” said Ajibero.

Africa as a whole feels much the.

same way, according to Ajibero.
“Nigeria has taken a lead. It’s now
the richest country in Africa.” ’
Much of the Nigerian wealth
comes from oil. Nigeria ranks
second among oil exporters to the
United States behind Saudi Arabia.

The major language of Nigeria, 1

according to Ajibero, is English.
“We have three principal
languages—Hausa,Yoruba, and
Ibu——and there are two hundred
ethnic groups,” he said.

“We feel comfortable and Pitt is
very popular in Nigeria. There are
about 200 Nigerians at Pitt. That
shows it’s one of the most popular
universities in Nigeria,” said Ajibero.

-In addition to students, Nigeria

also sends top government officials_

to Pitt for conferences and classes, ' _

according to Ajibero, who believes
about two thousand Nigerians are
already studying in the United
States.

“And there are more and more
who are willingto come to the U.S.,”
he said.

An initial difficulty with many Nig-
erians students, said Ajibero, is the I
language. “The intonation is the
problem. We speak with a heavy

. accent, and people can’t undertand

us. You have to say again and again,
‘excuse me.’ ” « ’

The major problem with Niger-
ians at Pitt is the housing. “Looking
for an apartment in the Oakland
area is difficult and expensive. The
graduate students’ university hous-
ing, where I live, increases the rent
every year,”said Ajibero. ,

~ For the most part, however,
Ajibero-finds Americans to be “quite '
accomodating. We don’t find people
looking down on us,particularly the
faculty;,they try to respond toour
problems.”

A person within the university
whom Ajibero believes deserves to
be recognized is Rhea Boudaoud, of
the Office of International S_ervic’.efs.>..
in Mervis -Hall.

According to Ajibero, Boudaouct:  ,

“has been particularly helpful. She-.
has been very wonderful, and I think

‘credit should go to her.’’ 000

Julie Slim

\

seen in the u.s., Julie Slim has

7 lived in Lebanon since she was two

years old. Four years ago she came
back as a freshman speech pathol-
ogy major at Pitt.

“Everyone in Lebanon wants to —

come to the States, because it’s so
industrial and modernized here,”
said Slim. People in Lebanon “try to
imitate the U.S. in their clothes and
accents. Lebanon is westernized in
a lot of ways.” .1

‘Although the Lebanese like the‘
American people, they don’t like
Anferican politics, Slim said. “The
people think the U.S. has a handin
the wars in the Middle East.”

Although she had visited the U.S.
before moving here, Slim had prob-
lems adjusting because of her shy-
ness. She found that “most people
avoid you if you’re foreign. They
hear your accent and are interested,
in you for about five minutes.” .-

Slim likes the U.S.. but like most.
native Lebanese she has met here,
she wants to return home.

“I’m sure that Americans in for-
eign countries want to come home
also. Lebanese people here don’t
like the lifestyle because it’s too fast
and money-oriented; in Lebanon it’s
more easygoing,” she said.

Slim will return to Lebanon soon.
After graduation in August, she is
going there to work for one semes-

, ter before returning to the States to

attend graduate s_chool._'OOo

sport where individuality was
exercised forthe good of the
team, but ever since the dual
meet system has been abolished
in favor of multi-team invita-

.@~tionals, individual performan-

ces have taken ‘priority ‘over
team performances. ‘
Several members of the
Panther track team will attempt
to reach the NCAA champion-
ships as they travel to Princeton
University this weekend to par-
ticipate in the‘ Intercollegiate
Amateur Athletic Association

ships. .
The Panthers readied them-
selves for the upcoming meet by
participating in the ‘Penn State
Open Invitational ‘last week-
end. Pitt was. particularly
strong in the 800—ineter run,

“with, Terry Gallagher taking

/,

«Q ':

"second with a time of 1:492, fol-
lowed" by Todd Colas who
crossed the finish line in 1249.8.
Both times were good enough
to quality for the (lC4As).

The only other top Panther
finisher was Rick Asberry, who
finished second in the 100-
meter dash with a time of 10.7.

Collegiate track was once a ‘

of America (IC4As).champion- ,‘

iOne noticeable absentee at
University Park was All-
America middle-distance
runner Darren Geary. Accord-
ing to Coach Mike Agostinella, .
' Geary missed the meet because
of a family emergency. Thejun-
ior from Washington, D.C.
returned '-Monday and will run_
in the IC4As.

Agostinella said that the meet
was not as strong as other invi-
tationals since entries are‘
accepted as late as the day of the
race. ‘ - '

“Some events were strong,
such as the 800-meter run,
where the winner ran a 1:47,
and the 400-meter run, which
was run in 45.07,” Agostinella
said. “These events were of high
quality, but the others were just
average.”

Agostinella can rest assured
of the quality of the IC4A.par-
ticipants. The times of this meet
will determine who participates
in the NCAA’s to be held at
Brigham Young University in
Provo, Utah next month. 

.Among the Panthers who
will compete at Princeton are
Geary, ‘Colas, Gallagher and
Gardland Brown in the 800-
meter, Asberry in the 100-meter,
Roger Kingdom in the 110-
_meter high hurdles and two

sprint relay teams——the, 1600-
meter relay squad of Asberry,
Swayne DeFopr, Brian Pollock
and a fourth runner to be
named later by Agostinella
along with the 400-meter relay '
team of Asberry, Pollock, Kind-

gom and Panther cornerback L

Tim Lewis.

Agostinella said that with‘ the

right breaks, the members who

' will be running at Princeton
will be travelling to Provo two’
weeks hence.

“I think everyone has a shot
to qualify for the NCAA’s,”
Agostinella said. “It depends on
being at the right place at the
right time——having other peo-

. ple pushing our guys."

In analyzing his team, Agos-
tinella said‘that he can’t_com-
pare this year's squad to others
since the makeup of the team
varies every year-—a team can
have a strong emphasis in field A
events one year while the next
year they may bestrong in the
distance events. Although he
can’t say that this year’s team is
better or worse than those of the
past, Agostinella was “nonethe-
less" pleased with the team’s
performance.

‘‘I think‘ we have done very
well,” he said. “The 1600-meter

to say,.“No deal.” Sampson then
decided to remain at Virginia for
his senior year. e

Terry Cummings of DePaul,.

Dominique Wilkens of Georgia

they do every year at about this

Some argue that,the players will my

Some argue that an athlete's
playing career is short -and that a
diploma goes a long way toward
securing a future. Education, they
say, is a valuable experience.
Maybe. But how much of an educa-
tion can an athletelget when he

gymnasium with a basketball than
in the dorm room with a notebook.
Simply put, most athletes spend
more time ‘ shooting 22-foot

negative comment on athletes, but

merely a statement on what college

sports have become. »
Moreover, most employers hire

name and face, not for their aca-
demic prowess. To wit, former ath-
letes are generally hired by
insurance ‘firms, banks or network

that use the athletes as a marketing
tool and a means of identification.
They don't care if the athletes grad-*

Still, there are cynics who
denounce basketball players for

prematurely accepting lucrative P

owners. This not only robs our col-
lege gymnasium of top caliburath-
letes, but it diminishes the intense
atmosphere found in basketball
dynasties such as Marquett,
and Virginia. Chalk
another one up for those glutto-
nous NBA executives-—they surely
know how to spoil school spirit.

Up until 1976, a collegiate player

had to prove “financial hardship”
before entering into the NBA draft.
Thanks
manipulation by greedy owners,
now a player must only announce

' his intention of relinquishing his
' collegiate status.

This year's deserters North
Carolina’s top ‘scorer James
Worthy, San Francisco’s Quintin
Dailey, DePaul’s 6-9 All America
forward Terry Cummings and
Georgia's Dominique Wilkins
have already opted for the_ pro
draft. Remember these names,
because today's college superstars
may become tomorrow's unnoticed
sixth players.

College players claim they have
valid arguments for forgoing the
educational path, one of which is
the fear of injury. Valid

to considerable iiegal,

argument—yes. However is the
purpose of college to educate or
serve as a minor league for the
‘NBA? Nowadays, the latter may be
more accurate.

Another argument of underclass
basketball stars involves the big
greenbuck‘. Players claim that
much of their bargaining power is
lost if they complete four years of
college. just another example of
how greed is’ slowly transforming
college basketball from a fun game
to a highly complex buisness.

Keeping top players in school is
another problem that originated
with’. the early draft syndrome.
Once a full-ride for four years was
enough to keep an athlete in
school. Today scholarships are

nothing but attention grabbers,
used as commonly as buy-one-gee

one-free deals in supermarkets.

Full scholarships no longer
attract-—-they are taken for granted.

To draw talent into a school, a
college must now offer extra entice-
ments such as luxurious housing
and catered meals." For example,
take Virginia’s superstiir Ralph

Sampson, who decided to remain a

with the‘Ca_valiers for his senior
year, sacrificing the honor of being
the first player selected in this
year's draft. An admirable decision
however being offered the-most
prestigious living, quarters on
_campus—The Lawn--may have
influenced the decision, just a bit.

If Sampson were enrolled at Pitt,
coach Roy Chipman would have to
dish our~full scholarship with all
ill? lfimlllings. along with the

penthouse flooriof the Cathedral
for his personal residence.

Having players pick the option I

of an early draft ruins a team's ros-
ter and makes future expectations
unattainable, but mostly, it erodes
school spirit.iApathy runs amuck
throughout many college cam-
puses, with athletes turning
against fellow classmates in favor
of power seeking owners only rein-
forcing the cold attitude.

Basketball loses its thrill when-

. ever a player's heart migrates from ‘R

his school to the bank.

Unfortunately, college basket-
ball, as many other institutions in
our world, is slowly disintegrating.
In the conflict between owners and
school spirit, greed is working in

favor of _ the owners.

Clyde Vaughan‘ Will Need FreshinanSuppOrt

By KEVIN TURRENTINE

By late November, the Pitt sports
scene will haveundergone several
changes. A new athletic director
will be patrolling Pitt sports, the
Big East will no longer be a mirage
but a reality, and six new faces will
answer to the fickle demands of Pitt’
basketball fans. '

Who will be the new Terry
Knight, Larry Harris, Carlton Nev-

erson, Sam Clancy, Darrell Gissen-
danner or Dwayne Wallace? Or
who will be the new Steve Gordon,
Dan Landy or Paul Brozovich?

On a team where individuality is
a, misnomer and slow-down is as

popular as the Pittsburgh winter,’

the style of play rapidly’ becomes
specialized. Voids must be filled
and raw talent refined.

Pittjs weak spots are evident,

Anyone who has ever ventured
between the Monongahela and
,Allegheny Rivers knows that Pitt
has not had a legitimate center in
quite some time. Andre Williams
served his tenure in the middle spot
admirably last year, but like his
predecessor, Sam Clancy, Williams
was playing out of position.

' Pitt must takethe pressure off of

Clyde Vaughan, their leading
scorer‘ and rebounder last season.
\Vaughan will find the /going

tougher in the Big East where

enemy defenses will be ready for an
ambush.

At ‘point guard——a position
where Pitt ‘is lacking—will be

- either Billy Culbertson or sopho-

'more Charlie Williams.

A major key to the Panther's
future will be finding a suitable
replacement for Darrell Gissen-
danner. For years, Pitt has relied on
lightning quick guards to spark a
late rally or to stir up a little may-
hem, giving them victories without
a true center.

Pitt's search for players is a top

priority this year, lest they forget ,

the caliber of play in the Big East.
“There will be added pressure to
compete in the Big East this
upcoming. season," said Assistant
Coach Seth Greenberg. 0 ti
- Coach Roy Chipman this began
his search for blue-chippers worthy
of competition in perhaps the
toughest conference in America.
With that in\mind, here is the Pitt
hoopster class of 1986:
Keith Armstrong
6-8, 235 lbs., center
' Ypsilanti High School
Ypsilanti, Michigan

raeriirniwwetis, wédnesriay, May:-m982—v   ’

Armstrong will be a fine player
in the Big East especially if he can
make an adjustment from center to
forward when needed. He has bet-
ter than average leaping ability and
is extremely impressive off the
boards. As an all-stater last year,
Armstrong averaged 13 points per

' game (9 points below his junior

year average). He was good for l4
rebounds and 6 blocked shots per
game. If Armstrong shows the abil-
ity to post low, the center woes may
be solved.

Matt Miklasevich

6-6, 200 lbs., power forward
‘ Franklin Regional

Murrysville, Pennsylvania

For the first time in history, a
male athleteat Pitt will be com-
pared to the ability\of his sister, and
rightly so. Matt is the kid brother of

women's basketball All-America“

Pam Miklasevich. Their style of
play are mirror-images. Matt is a

. strong defensive rebou-rider but

lacks, an outside touch. He is foul

prone, which has been a problem‘
. with nearly all of Pitt’s'forwards in

recent years. He won’t crack into
the starting line-up immediately,
but will see considerable playing
time during the season.

Bryan Mitchell

6-4, 190 lbs., guard
Lexington Catholic
Lexington, Kentucky ‘

That's two years in a row that
Pitt has stolen a blue-chipper from
under the nose of Kentucky coach
Joe B. Hall. Mitchell is the leading
candidate to replace master, de-
fenseman Darrell- Gissendanner.
An all-city guard at Lexington
Catholic, where he averaged 18"‘
points, 12 rebounds, and 7 assists
per game, Mitchell specialized in
defense. _

“Wehave to fill a void at the two
guard positions,’.’ Greenberg said.
“Bryan Mitchell may fill one of
them.”

Joey David ‘
6-4,‘ 185 lbs., guard

Upper St. Clair

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

Basketball is commonplace in
the David family. Joey's father,
Rev. Sam David, was a standout
forward at Pitt _

action. Lake, who left the Univer-

Pitt, is an excellent rebounder as

well as a fine outside shooter. He

can take his man outside or post

a tough player who likes “inside

Jeff Robinson

6-9, 190 lbs., center

Broad Ripple High School
University of Cincinnati
Indianapolis, Indiana

Touted as "the best high school
player in Indianapolis since Oscar
Robertson,” Robinson travelled a
confusing path through the Uni-
versity of Cincinnati, becoming
disgruntled by a lack of playin
time. -

During an
school career, Robinson was
named to two All-America teams,
was runner-_up for Indiana's “Mr.

Robinson played in 11 of Cin-

daisical defensive player.”

The question in need of an
answer is, how will Robinson react
if he doesn’t immediately become a
starter? Since Robinson is a
transfer student he must sit out this
upcoming season.

The Pitt team and coaching staff

has a tough task ahead. They muszé

ence with a team of unfamiliar
faces. Greenberg. is optimistic, say-
ing that “we’ve been getting better
and better every year, and we will
strive for the same results in the
future.”
_ With the talent offered by the
incoming recruits, Pitt can con.
sider success only a matter of time.

By KEVIN TURRENTINE

The mark of a true champion is
the ability to rise to the occasion.

By this standard, could there be a-

truer champion than the New York
Islanders? The answer- is simple.
No.

With a last minute come-from-
behind victory against the upset-
minded Penguins, a deceptively
easy six game series against the
cross-town rival Rangers, a rapid
disarming of the potent Quebec

{Ngrdiques and finally, a convinc-

. uigi thrashing of the hapless Van-
couver Canucks in the Stanley Cup
finals, the Islanders have left no
doubt that they are the best in the
NHL.

The Penguins provided the
toughest competition for the
Islanders. With 5:50 left in the fifth
and deciding first round game, the
Penguins held a two-goal lead and
a tightened noose around the neck
of the Islanders. But the Islanders
jumped all over an error by Pens

defenseman Randy Carlyle, turn--

Islanders Win Yet Another Stanley Cup

ing it into a goal, and more impor-
tantly, gaining priceless
momentum. The Penguins began
playing to keep from losing rather
than to win.

The end. Two minutes later, the
score was tied at four, eventually
sending the game into overtime—a
place familiar to the defending
champion Islanders. Minutes later,
john Tonelli lifted a shot past a
stubborn Michel Dion, taking the
Islanders into round two. The
noose slipped from the Penguins’
grasp.

Although the Rangers extended
the Islanders to six games, the out-
come was never in doubt. The
Rangers lone glimmer of hope was
thwarting the Islanders string of
undefeated home games. Until
then, the Islanders had not lost a
home game in 1982.

The offensive minded Quebec

Nordiques became the Islanders’
third victim. Quebec stunned the

By KEVIN TURRENTINE

A well-conceived nickname adds
color to a sport, and instills an
image that reminds us of a particu-
lar team. For example, the Univer-
sity of Idaho, by all rights, should
be nicknamed the Potatoes, but
instead they are the Vandals, a
much more descriptive name. This
allows an author to write, “the
Vandals picked the pockets of the
Pitt Panthers." How would it
sound if someone said, “The physi-
cal Pitt Panthers poked the eyes out
of the Potatoes."

What would happen if the sports
schedules were based on nicknames

ter. In the NBA:

Wlov, to discuss plans for the Games.

A pleasant surprise from
Agostinella has been the perfor-
mance of Kingdom in the
hurdles. .

“After completing spring
football practice, he went out to
run a 14.07 in the Al 10 high hur-
dles, which breaks a school
record set back in 1954,” Agosti-
nella said.

But the strength of the 1982
Panther track team has been the
middle-distancerunners, led by
Geary. Along with Brown,
Colas and Gallagher, they have

».§_}.\gone against the best in the

country and come out winners.

However, since they have
been in competition since
December, fatigue has begun to
set in. Agostinella said that he is
banking on the thrill of run-
ning in two important meets to

frevive the team.

“We have to wait and see how
they do in the meet,” Agosti-
nella said. “They have been
competing since December.
That's six months of active
competition, whereas football

goes for only three or four
months."

He adds, “I hope to cap off
the season with good perfor-

The Soviets are upset over the
planning and facilities for the Los
Angeles Games. -

Ueberroth refused to say_ if th
Soviet Union had given him any
insurance of sending their team in
1984.

Stopgstallingi...

It appears that Dean Smith will
have to put his four-corner stall
offense into the closet.

Yesterday, the Atlantic Coast
Conference voted to install a 30-
second shot clock for next seaon’s

.v”a'i‘r‘“z-.’t““»'ft

games. Along with the clock, the
ACC will also try a three-point
field goal for shots beyond 19 feet.

Thechanges will have to be
passed by the NCAA rules commit-
tee, but ACC commissioner Bob
James is confident that the one year
experiment will pass. He said that
the two changes must be passed
together or neither one will take
effect. ' V

The shot clock will work in the.
same manner as the National Bas-
ketball Association's 24-second
clock. It will start when a team puts
a ball into play. A shot must be
attempted before time expires or

May 19, 1362 _
mt/')'~I' I'i‘~l ‘srll

the opposing team will receive the
ball.

Maybe Smith won’t have to give
up the four corners entirely. The
clock will be shut down during the
final four minutes of play or in any
overtime period.

Going broke...

Claiming that baseball is suffer-
ing from a terrible “economic dis-
orientation which could ruin the
competitive balance,” San Diego
Padres President Ballard Smith
listed reasons why clubs in smaller-
sized areas are losing so much
money.

Smith announced at a sports edi-
tors meeting earlier this week that
player’s salaries were not the cause
of the economic woes of baseball,
but rather it was the split of income
between teams .

Smith said that he knew of 15
major league clubs that would

""'L a5L 11

"')l . cf!
5

have serious financial problems if
their owners didn't put up the.
money to pay for the losses. He
added ‘that the losses have risen
drastically over the last few years.

Smith also said that with the vast
difference in earnings between the
clubs, the smaller clubs will “either
go broke or there will be a_ tremend-
ous turnover in clubs, which
would be bad."

According to Smith, the solution
is revenue sharing of television
money, like the National Football
League does. Although the 26
clubs split the income from
national television, the revenue is

small and the team has to depend ‘

on local and cable television.

Smith said that despite how well
the Padres perform on the field, the
ratings would not be substantially
increased due to the number of peo-
ple in the community. «

Smith concluded by saying that
there will be a conflict between the
large and small markets over
revenue sharing.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, May 19, 1982 I“

By BARRY ZASLOFF

Some things I think I think.
0 Calvin Griffith; owner of the

i Minnesota Twins, has just begun

his business venture of unloading
all. of his high salaried players. His
lineup next week will include: Biff
Pacoroba as catcher; Doe Boyland
at first; Tony Bernazard at second;

1 Mario Mandoza at shortstop and

Jim Morrison at third. In the ou.t~
field will be : Eddie Milner (not to
be confused with ex-Pirate John
Milner) in left field, Rudy Law in
center and Bob Denier in right
field. Dale Berra will be cut due to a
prolonged hitting slump.

0 Pirate second baseman Johnny
Ray is much better than average, as

, many people suggested when he

came to Pittsburgh in exchange for
Phil Garner.

0 Foge Fazio may be a tad too
humorous for a head football
coach. V

o The Penguins’ recent strong
showing against the New York
Islanders did more harm than
good. It gave one of the worst regu-
lar seasgn hockey teams a reason

Sports Grab-bag   

for tranquility. -

O The Penguins are as far from
being equal to the Islanders as
Antarctica is from Canada.

0 Filling extra space in the news-
paper at 12 p.m. on deadline night
is about as fun as a trip to Buhl
Planetarium.

O The Meadows Race Track is a
fun place to be up until the time the
first bet is placed.

‘O Athletes today are better than
they were during the years past.

0 I hope my father doesn't read
the above statement.

0 I stand by my conviction that
Dave Parker is the best outfielder in
the game of baseball.

0 The phrase “baseball, hot

dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet,"

should be changed to "football,
beer, Pac-Man and Toyota."
0 The Pitt administration will

look no farther than their own i

backyards to replace Cas Myslinski
as athletic director‘.

. 0 Having, failed to sign a top-
notch center, the Panther basket-
ball team will finish no better than
sixth in the Big East next season.

\ I'm stopping here « because my
stomach yearns for a Wendy's
triple.

Because she treats her body the same way, she
discovered a lump in her breast a few years ago. ‘ \

She discovered it early. And these days, 85% of early.
breast cancers can be treated successfully.

Judy has since had reconstructive surgery, too. And
she feels like herself again. Alive, vibrant, ready to get on
her bike and take on the.world.

Judy Lafferty is iust one example of the kind of
progress we're making against cancer in its many forms.

The American Cancer Society takes some credit for
that progress. But credit won't finance our work. . ~

We need your money to help us win this race.’
