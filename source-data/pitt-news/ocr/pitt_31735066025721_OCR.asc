Public Safety investigates incident

By John Temple
Staff Writer

Two officers on beat were by the Towers desk
when they saw a male student assaulting another,
according to police. By the time they arrived,
another man had joined in and the officers attempt-
ed to stop the ﬁght by forcibly pulling them apart.

The man who was being assaulted by the others
allowed‘ officers to restrain him, but the other, a
male student, assaulted an officer, who then struck
him with a nightstick, cutting his upper forehead.
The third man ran and has not been identified.

Eyewitness accounts. from students vary. Pitt stu-
dent Scott Smith said that two men were still fight-
ing when the officers arrived. However, first-year
student Yasmeen Lewis said that the two males
were apart when the officers arrived to break it up
and said they used unnecessary force. .

The fight stemmed from an incident earlier that
day, according to campus police, who said they

Allocations Committee looking

for new members for next year

By Christine Hanna
News Editor

The Allocations Committee,
under the Student Government
Board, is looking for students to
be a part of distributing the
Student Activities fee. ’ '

“We [a committee of 10 mem-
bers, two alternates and a chair]
allocate SGB’s portion of Student
Activitiesfee among undergradu-

ate CAS groups registered in
Student Activities,” said Lisa
Waslo, current chair.

Then they present the alloca-
tion requests to SGB, and they
make the decision, she said.

Waslo said that being a mem-
ber of the committee is beneficial
because you have the opportuni-
ty to leam a lot about other stu-
dent organizations.

“It has strengthened "me. I have

a great respect for students. They
are doing so many other things
than just going to class,” XX/aslo
said. i

Once a member of the com-
mittee, students must keep five
office hours a week during
spring and fall terms, and they
are not required to stay over the

summer. She said that no expen'— .

ence is required.The application
deadline is Nov. 12.

Libertarian endorsed
by Students for Life
for US. Senate race

By Mike Laughlin
Staff Writer

John F. Perry, the Libertarian candidate for the
Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race, spoke at last night’s
Students for Life meeting in the Cathedral of Learn-
ing.

SFL President Caleb Cohen introduced Perry as “the
only choice” in a race that primarily puts Democrat Lynn
Yeakel against Republican incumbent Arlen Specter. The
Christian Coalition’s “Voter Guide ‘92,” distributed before
the meeting by group members, showed how both Yeakel
and Specter support abortion on demand.

Perry began by saying how afraid he was that the elec-
tion would be turned into a one—issue campaign, and he
called abortion a symptom of deeper problems in our
society. ,

He cited the need to promote strong families, lower the
tax burden on families and promote Christian morality
throughout the nation. -

He said that he blamed divorce for increased levels of
drug abuse,.crime and homosexuality and high taxes for
placing an undue financial burden on families, which
leads to their breakup. .

Perry talked about three mythsabout abortion that he
said are untrue. He quoted beliefs by feminists that a fetus
was only a blob of tissue; that the fetus is a part of the
woman’s body, so this entitles her todo what she pleases
with it; and that abortion is simply a medical procedure.

“Doctors are supposed to heal, not kill, human beings,”
Perrysaid  .. t . ._

He also. said. the unborn child is an individual, com?
pletely separate from the mother. I 

Perry also blasted Roe vs. Wade. Before the decision V
was made, 49 states had anti—abortion laws, and the one
state that liberalized abortion, New York, was about to
rescind its own law, he said. ‘

Perry criticized the seven unelected Supreme Court
justices-for -using a constitutional right to privacy
that neyerex-is._ted to justify their decision, and he c~r_,i_t~i-_;-
cizecl Ih:é”"A’m”er’ican” people for letting them get away with
this. V I
“The problem can be handled at the state level,” Perry
said. . , _ ‘
Historical examples were used by Ferry to show how
the separate branches of government could ignore one
another if they choose to do so. Perry said that former

President Andrew Jackson publicly dared 'Supreme Court ‘ V.

Students bleed for a good cause

By David Weimer
Staff Writer

Students were bleeding in
the Forbes Quad lobby.

About a dozen portable
cushioned aluminum tables
were set up, and white uni-
formed phlebotomists hustled
from one prone body to
another, reassuring individuals
that everything was fine.

One uniformed person
blew up a rubber glove and
joked with nervous students.
“They need a good first-time
experience,” said Scot
Deutsch, a -registered nurse

and supervisor for the
Central Blood Bank of
Pittsburgh. 0

Pitt fraternities and sorori-
ties are participating in the
annual Pitt/Penn State Blood
Challenge. Everyone ‘is
encouraged to donate blood
in the name of his or her
favorite school at any of the
Central Blood Bank locations
on campus.

Jill Yoseloff, of Delta Zeta,

passed out key chains, but-
tons and Lifesavers at a table
set up _in the lobby. “It’s what
you are when you give blood,
a life saver,” she said. She has
been giving blood for nearly

four years.
One of the reasons for the
traditionally high Greek

turnout at these annual drives
is that Greek organizations at
Pitt and Penn State compete
to achieve the highest number
of donors. “\X7e’ve won the
last two years, and we’re try-
ing to do it again,” Yoseloff
said.

Central Blood Bank coordi-
nator Dave Edmunds has
been working with the Greek
Week blood drives for the last
nine years and said that out of
5,000 Pitt donors last year,
3,200 were fraternity and
sorority members. He said
that this event “makes donat-
ing blood fun.”

By 4 p.m. on Monday, over
100 donors had let blood
bank workers “tap a pint.”

Although blood drives are

common, many people hesi-
tate to give because of the
understandable fear of the
tool used — a needle.

Kristi Stein, a pledge with
Delta Phi Epsilon, said that
the support other donors gave
her helped her get through
this first-time experience.

“It helps having all my sis-
ters and pledge -sisters here
with me. It helps a lot,” Stein
said.

Stein was sitting at the
“recovery tables” with several
sorority sisters who had also
donated blood.

Donors are‘ required to
spend 15 ‘minutes eating
snacks and drinking juice. A
TV was set up nearby, playing
at video of “The Ren and
Stimpy Show.”

“I think everyone should
give blood. If you ever need it
you’ll want to know that it’ll
be there, because someone
else gave,” Stein said.

Students‘and faculty can
give blood through Nov. 18.

BiGALA presidents
look for fresh start

By Lane C. Hornfeck
Staff Writer

Newly elected co-presidents of BiGALA,
Robin Poland and John Fantin, spoke of
upcoming events and organizational commit-
tees at Wednesday's meeting.

“We want to form a social committee and an
educational committee,” Poland said. “We
want to get a consensus of what people
want.”

Fantin would like to see “a fresh start and
[we] hope to get a lot of people interested.
We want to be visible  an important key.”

According to Fantin, BiGALA is forming
“RAP” groups where people are able to come
and deal with (their) coming out. “We’ve also
talked about starting a Black Issues Group,”
Fantin said. .

According to Todd Kinavey, former co—presi-
dent of BiGALA, starting new groups and
tasks takes not only a concerted effort but
also a lotlof time. ‘‘We didn't get the word
out last time. These things take time,” he
said.

Addressing upcoming events, Poland told of
Queer Art, which will be on Nov. 10 and 13.
The exhibit will present local gay, lesbian and
bisexual artists, including performance art, lit-
erature, sculpture and film.

She also said that Spirituality Week, which
will be held on December 2 and 4-, will facili-
tate the opportunity for lesbian, gay and
bisexual people to discuss issues of religion
and spirituality.

like at London bookstores, but all
of the books are expected to sell
by Christmas, said Russ
Kierzkowski, Trade Department
buyer for the Book Center.

“In the 25 years I’ve worked
here, this book is not any different
from unmentioned books,”

Kierzkowski said. “The publicity is ~

due to the celebrity name.”

As for the moral issue involved in
the controversy, whether Madonna
went too far in the photos of
homosexuality, beastiality, bisexual-

ity, S & M, masturbation and exhi-
bitionisms, Kierzkowski said that
decision is “up to the individual.”

The book is available for viewing
for those over the age of 18 upon
special request at the Book Center
and for sale at $49.95. Several Pitt
students who viewed the book
were not surprised at the content
or that Madonna would publish
such controversial photos. None of
the students thought the book was
worth the price either.

The majority of female students
who viewed the book said they
were either repulsed, confused or
bored with the book. Certain pic-
tures received more response than
others. One in particular, which
made each viewer wince and
moan, is a picture where Madonna
is pulling a man’s nipple ring with
her teeth. ’

Robin Bell, a fifth—year sociology
and legal studies major, found the
most disgusting photo to be the
one where Madonna is sucking
someone’s toe. “That’s sick,” Bell
said. “There could be toe-jam in
there.”

Kenia Encarnacion, a senior polit-
ical science major, was not
impressed with the publication

    
buyer interest at the Book Center

either. “This sort of book is expect-
ed of someone who has absolutely
no musical or artistic talent,” she
said.

The New Yorle Times Book
Review critic Caryn James was dis-
appointed with the final product as

.well. James trashed the book’s

appearance, professional photogra-
phy and quality, as well as
Madonna’s decision to produce the
book.

“How did Madonna, one of our
few genuine pop-culture icons,
manage to lose her sense of humor,
her imagination and her sexiness
all at the same time?” James asked.

He suggests that Madonna has

succumbed to the monetary hunger ‘

and power that led to Elvis’ demise
as a Las Vegas show king.

One male viewer at the Book
Center, who wished not to be iden-
tified, was less ready to criticize
Madonna. “Don’t knock it ‘til you
try some of the stuff in the book,”
he said.

The book is not on display in the
Book Center because that would
create a better opportunity for
minors to sneak a peek. Once the
Mylar wrapping is unsealed, the
book cannot be returned.

“Sometimw the only way you can feel good is by making
someone else look bad. And. I ’m tired of making other peo-
ple feel good about themselies. 

-— Homer Simpson

There is something rotten in the state of Oakland. It is
not the garbage in between Uncle Sam’s and Roy Rogers.
It is the Pitt Panther football team.

A proud program just 10 years ago has become the
laughing stock of Eastern football. Once a team that could
go toe to toe against the best teams in the country, Pitt
now gets embarrassed by ﬁerce rivals West Virginia and
Penn State.

It would be too much to ask that Pitt dominate the way
it did in the Johnny Majors/Jackie Sherrill era of the late
‘70s and early ‘80s. Even getting trounced by Notre Dame
is —— acceptable. But making a terrible Maryland team

look like Super Bowl Champions and being humiliated at \

Homecoming by East Carolina (hardly a football power) is
too much to bear. T

Who is responsible for the public shame that our foot-
ball team, our most visible public relations tool, has
become? Many fingers point to head coach Paul Hackett.

Last Thursday night, a rally was held at The Decade in
which a mannequin depicting Hackett swung from noose
thrown over a telephone pole. This action may be a bit
drastic, but itgwas not taken from out of the blue. It is just
one example of how fans and Pitt students alike have
become utterly frustrated with the performance of this
team and have taken out their frustrations on'Hackett.

At Homecoming, members of the student section (those
who didn’t already leave in disgust) began a cheer of
“Fire Hackett” as it becameclear that Pitt would lose- ,_

Whentﬁackett--assume'd"the" helrn,- he stressed that he

‘ was going to recruit only true “student athletes” for his

football program. That is an admirable goal, but not con-
ducive to winning. The administration cannot continue to
live the Charade that we can run this football program like
an Ivy -League school. If the administration wants to do
that, then maybe we 'shouldn’t pretend we can play com-
petitive football with teams like Notre Dame and Penn
State on our schedule. 1

Pitt charges $17 to wimess the weekly carnage in Pitt
Stadium. For a team as sorryas this one, it should be pay-
ing people to watch them. Student and fan apathy is at an
all-tirne high, and no wonder — there is absolutely noth-
ing to cheer about on that field save the band. Now there
is dedication.

Following Pitt’s loss to Rutgers on national television
Sept. 17, local college football guru Beano Cook asked

‘Hackett if Pitt finished the season with a 4-8 record,

would he rehire himself. Of course Hackett said he

I would. If that is the case Paul, don’t look in the stands,

because no one will be there. Maybe not even the band.

Court ruling could hurt 01' Miss

Several years ago, a movie
called Mississi'ppi Burning was
produced dealing with the state’s
controversial racial past. The
movie became a center of criti-
cism due to a lot of non—factual
information, but the title is very
accurate in describing the level
of emotions toward the recent
Ayers desegregation case.

The point of this whole case,
filed by the late Jake Ayers,
claimed the state had-not proper-
ly ended segregation by retain-
ing five predominantly white and
three mainly black universities.
The case also stated the system’s
curriculum and salaries were not
equal in number and funding.

Before I proceed any further,

“somehow I feel I may be giving

a dim picture of Mississippi. But
I love this state with all my heart,
which means that I want what is
best for it. I am afraid the Ayers
decision, while it will benefit us
in many ways if its. goals are
met, may also hurt us as a fami-
ly. , -
Mississippi, which is usually
rated last in many statistics, can
now be a national leader in
higher education if the state will

"allow its appointed leaders to do
1 their jobs in resolving the case.

Many other states, Louisiana

being on our heels, are watching '

to see how we deal with "this
decision. The way things look
now, I feel bad for our nation.

The very reason our state
removed the administration of
universities from the legislature
was to get as much of the poli-
tics out of the system as possible.
The College Board was estab-
lished so a group could run the
universities without fear of pres-
sure groups and other govern-
ment control that is usually
fueled strictly by emotions, not
sound common sense.

The College Board is constitu-
tional. It consists of 12 members
appointed by the governor for
12 staggered terms, and they are
charged with setting all policy
and distributing all funds appro-

‘S priated by the state legislature.

' It is a fact that this state isebasi-

Cally poor. Becauseof years of
discrimination and political tur-

moil, we have dug ourselves into

a deep hole, which is why this
case is so detrimental to the
state. The Ayers case is designed
to change the system from prac-
tices that are decades old, which
makes any change, no matter
how good, very difficult.
Mississippians and other affect-
ed states’ citizens must think
about their respective states as a

Baker

whole and in the context of how
much we and they can afford
financially.

On the financial side, the 1992
legislature passed a one percent
sales tax increase, so the extra
money will help fund education.
About $23 million was given to

‘ the College Board to distribute

among the system. Although
very much needed, and a great
gesture, the new money will not
solve our problems. As is evi-
denced by the debate to close
several universities.

You cannot necessarily solve a
problem like this by throwing
more money into it. As usual, the

whole thing became racial and‘

began to polarize our state
according to race. If a historically
black university is closed, (e.g.
Mississippi Valley State) the state
will hear loud opposition from
its students and alumni. The
same goes for any historically
white university. The end result
may be Mississippi being possi-
bly recognized as racial hatred
ground.

I wholeheartedly agree that
our black universities have
helped many black youths to
have a better chance at success.
That is not the issue. The fact is
that MVSU and the other histori-
cally black institutions were cre-

ated by former House Speaker ‘

Walter Sillers for one ptupose —
to give blacks an education

under the Civil Rights Act but to
keep them separate from whites.
Of course, as the ruling stated,
this is wrong. I

The state College Board has

very tough decisions to make,
and in the end, anything that it
proposes will make someone
mad. But if the board’s proposals
create high quality access to an
education for everyone and if it
meets the state’s budget, then
they must live with it. The state
is not supposed to satisfy itself in

the end; the end results must sat— 9

isfy the courts.

The College Board members
, did not create this dilemma, the

U.S. Supreme Court did as a
result of conditions created by
past administrations. If blame

should be passed, it should go to.

past governors and legislators,
but of course that would accom-
plish nothing. What makes this
more of a dilemma is that the
court did not give enough
specifics on how to solve the sit-

uation. “You still have segrega— .

tion, here are the areas to look

at. Solve it to our satisfaction.” '

Then it passed it back to the
original judge who heard the
decision.

To be honest, I cannot give
any definite solutions. But I will
say that I do not like the closing
of a university if it does not con-
tribute to the result of the Jake
Ayers case.

Closing the Mississippi State
University Veterinary School or
the University of Mississippi

Dentistry School will hurt our

state tremendously. It will not
bring an end to the years of
political and racial turmoil that
Mississippi has faced. Actually it
could cause further strife — fur-

ther pain. A MVSU closure.

should be sought only if

‘absolutely no other solutions can _

be found that will fit the state’s
budget.

Pitt begins
basketball

preparations

By Cory Walborn
Senior Staff Writer

With the swish of the net,
the sound of squeaky sneak-
ers and the pounding of the
round ball on the hard-wood

floor, basketball is once.

again the talk around Cain-
pus. _

Yesterday, it was the talk
Evans as he
described his players, the
Big East and the upcoming
1992-1993 season at Pitt’s
first basketball press confer-
ence of the year.

The Panther head coach
was optimistic and said that
with several veteran players,
the.early part of the season
will be a smooth transition
for the younger players.

“We’re looking forward to
the season,” Evans said. “I
think we got some good
enthusiasm, some good
young kids. We got some
kids that came back stronger
from last year.

“Kids like Chris Gant are
benching 2.70 pounds, and
his rebounding is going to
help,” Evans said. “Jerry
Mcculloughgis back shooting
the ball mucirbetter than he
did’ a year ago.

“Eric lMobleyl is back
wanting to play basketball
and wanting to get it done
academically as well, and
has done a 180 in both areas
 We’re real proud of the
way he is starting out. I

Playing against its toughest competition yet,

the Pitt lacrosse team posted an unimpressive
1-2 record at the annual Mountaineer
Invitational "Lacrosse Tournament last week-
end at West Virginia University.

The Panthers, one of the. pre-tournament
favorites, suffered back-to-back losses in their
first two outings at the hands of Glyndon
(Baltimore) Lacrosse Club, 8-1, and the
Northern Virginia Lacrosse Club, 7-4. Their
only victory came as a result of forfeit by
their third opponent, Washington and

‘ Jefferson.

Despite their poor record, Pitt head coach
Gary Neft was pleased with the way the team
stood up against obviously better competi-
tion. , V ,

“We played the best two teams we have
ever played,” Neft said. “The whole defense
played well and so did our goaltender, but it

is hard to stand out due to the better compe—« _.

tition. I thought it was a total team effort.”

Against Glyndon, a three-time champion of
the “Mountaineer,” Pitt played well defensive-
ly, only surrendering eight goals to a team
that is loaded with ex-Division I players.

On the offensive end, the Panthers’
usually high—scoring attack had trouble solv-
ing Glyndon’s goaltender-, beating him only

Lacrosse struggles at W   pl/U Irzz/itoztiomzl I

once.

The story was much the same in their
next game. Although Pitt held a 1-0 lead,
Northern Virginia’s experience and talent
proved to be too much for the Panthers and
they were handed their second defeat in two

‘ games. J
“The thing was, I could not even play any

of the younger guys on the team,” Neft said.
“The competition was so much better, it
would have been like throwing them t9 the
wolves." ‘

This year, a total of 16 teams were invited
to the “Mountaineer.” Each team was placed
randomly in one of four brackets, The winner

. of each bracket advanced to the semi-finals,

while the losers went home.

“I thought the format was terrible,” Neft
said....“You had to win your bracket to
advance. There was no incentive to play the
final game in your bracket if you had already
lost. That is why W & J didn’t even bother to
play the last game.”

Pitt’s fall season is now complete, and the
team’s next game is not until March 4, when
the Panthers will host Washington and
Jefferson in their first game of the spring sea-
son.

“Our fall schedule was harder this year than
it has ever been, but I think our team is also
better,” Neft said. “We just have to get ready
for the tougher competition this spring.”

 

Halloween night brings
Madness to Field House

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer '

Halloween night this year
was a bit different for
Panther hoop fans.

Fitzgerald Field House
was the sight of “Midnight
Madness” last Saturday
night as fans and players
attempted to scare all the
ghosts and goblins from

’previous basketball seasons‘

out of the field house in
style. A

The NCAA rules state that
a college basketball team is
not permitted to start prac-

. ticing until Nov. 1.

Many schools‘ take advan-
tage of this rule by staging a
pep rally at midnight on
Oct. 31 to get enthusiasm
for the upcoming basketball

season off to a great start

for both the fans and the
players.

This was the first time a
midnight madness event
was staged at Pitt.

The mandness drew a
full house to the field house

to watch and sometimes
participate in what turned

rout ‘to be a full night

of exciting and fun activi-
ties.

University officials who
attended include Pitt
President J.
O'Connor, Pitt Athletic
Director Oval Jaynes and
Assistant Athletic Director
Dean Billick, who coordi-
nated most of the night’s
events.

Former players who

attended included Curtis_

Aiken, Nate Bailey, John
Blanton and Darelle Porter,
who said he thought the
event was a great idea.

Also in attendance were a
full force of field house
fanatics and students, who
showed despite the number
of parties going on
Halloween night.

Doors opened at 10:30
and the crowd awaited anx-
iously as the PA system
blared such Halloween clas-
sics as “Monster Mash,” “The

think you will see him be
one of the premier centers in
the‘ Big East,” Evans‘ said.
"‘Returnin§“’ to‘ help‘ the
Panthers in the frontcourt is
senior small forward Antoine
Jones, who was an injury
redshirt last season.

“He is much more stronger
and much more offensive,”
Evans said of Jones. “He has
worked very hard with his
jump shot, and he’s a very
mature and aggressive kid
that hates to lose. His atti-
tude gives us another win-
ning attitude on the floor,
which will definitely help.”

»::-.: ' * ' «: :- . . ' "xx; , J.‘ ;;v-'..;.

  

Joining Mobley and Jones
in the frontcourt is senior
Chris McNeal. The 6-foot-7-
inch power forward will be
asked to provide the leader-
ship for the younger players.

“We got off to a good start
yesterday,” McNeal said of
the Panthers’ first practice,
which was three hours long.
“We didn’t do as well as I
thought we would, but with
more practice time we will
be all right.”

McNeal said that sopho-
more Orlando Antigua is
back from a sprained ankle
and is playing well.

good,” McNeal said. “Antoine
[Jones] is playing well,
Ahmad [Shareef] is playing
well, but I think you’ll see
our young guys contribute
more.”

Young guys like
McCullough, first-year guard
Garrick,Thomas and junior
college transfer Marlon
Rhymes will have to con-
tribute early for the Panthers
to get off to a good start.

Rhymes, from Central
Arizona College, will be

.. pushing for some playing

is likely that Rhymes willgbe

Addams Family” theme,
“Werewolf of London” and
“Thriller.”

The first event of the
night was a costume con-
test, which had about two
dozen contestants from the
stands.

Audience cheers deter-
mined the winner.

The event ended up in a
three-way tie between a girl
wearing a fabric Miller Lite
beer can, a guy wearing a
big foam head and arms and
the.fan known as “Panther
Paul” who always cheers at
the field house during the
song “Hey.”

Next was a free—throw
contest for fans in which
about a half of a dozen fans
won between $20 and $50
for making free throws from
either the foul line or three-
point line.

Following free throws by
the crowd, fans competed
with Pitt President O’Connor
and Pitt head coach Paul
Evans in another free—throw
contest.

With about 10 minutes
left, the excitementstarted to
build even higher as the
band played and the
cheerleaders led cheers
which took the countdown
to one minute to midnight.

Then the field house went
completely dark — except
for the scoreboard, which
show_ed the last minute
counting down, resembling
the New Year’s Eve apple
dropping down in Times
Square.

The last 10 seconds con-
sisted of the crowd

one.

At midnight the 2001
theme blared as the Pitt
basketball team stormed out
on to thecourt amongst a
dark field house being blast-
ed by spotlights from the
balcony. »

After the Pitt parade, th
introduction of players led
the crowd to give out a big
sigh as Mobley and compa-
ny all seemed to be eligible
to play.

This was also the fans’
first chance to meet the new

 

Pitt players.
Pitt head coach Paul Evans
thanked everybody for

attending and stated that the
excitement level so far has
brought back memories of

the Pitt/Oklahoma game a

few years ago — when Pitt
beat Oklahoma at the field
house where the crowd
played an instrumental part
of Pitt’s victory.

The Panthers’ first drill
consisted of a “dunk off”
where all the players did
layups at each basket with
the crowd responding to
each player who dunked
during the layups. _
— To the surprise of no one,
Eric Mobley was the star of
this drill.

The next event was the
dunk contest between Chris
Gant, Antoine Jones, Ahmad
Shareef and newcomer
Garrick Thomas.

The finalists were Thomas,
who won the slam dunk
contest last year as a high
school senior in-the Dapper
Dan game, and Jones.

The crowd cheered wildly
as Thomas attempted to
leapfrog over three people

‘at the same time as one of

those persons fed him the
ball on the alley-oop. Even
though Thomas missed his
dunk, the crowd chose him
to be the winner.

Pitt center and dunking
phenom Mobley was not in
the dunking contest.

“I sprained my ankle
about 10 days ago, and it is
still just a bit tender. We
didn’t want to take any
chances,” Mobley said.

Two eight—minute
intrasquad scrimmages were
the final event of the
evening. - ‘

A pleasant surprise was
the play of newcomer Andre
Aldridge. The New York
City native connected on
two three pointers in the
scrimmage.

“I’m looking forward to
playing at Pitt and con-
tributing right
Aldrige said after the scrim-
mage. ’

As the crowd was treated
to free refreshments after
the night’s activities, those

away,” '

in attendance called the
event a success.

“I thought we had a good
student turnout, and the
excitement level‘was great,”
Evans said.

Pitt’s administrators also
said they were very pleased.

“I thought the event was a
smashing success,” said
Larry Eldridge, Pitt’s head of
Sports Information.

“I thought we had a good
student turnout, and every-
body seemed real excited,”
Pitt’s Athletic Director Oval
Jaynes said. ,

“This event seemed like a
big success to me. I’d like
to know what the fans
thought,” Pitt assistant
coach Joe DeSantis said.

Most of the fans said they
loved the introductions and
felt that was the best part of
the night.

Free refreshments were ' 

served afterward on the bal-
cony, which was decorated
with pumpkins and corn
stalks.

As the field house emptied
out, it gave almost an
eerie feeling as the corn
stalks loomed quietly over-
head.

This left a lasting impres-
sion on whether the Pitt
basketball team will be able
to carry over the enthusiasm
into a “field of dreams” to
help build a successful 1993
season. '

Paul Hackett said he found
Ryan’s play a ray of light in a
murky afternoon of Panthers
football. 

“I think he handled it exactly
the way [we] hoped he would,”

_ Hackett said. “The key was that
he was poised.

“He just kept going about his
business  and showed some
signs of real life.”

In addition to providing
moments of momentum for an
otherwise sputtering Pitt
offense, the circumstances sur-
rounding Ryan’s insertion into
the lineup forced Hackett to
face the facts on the future of
the Panthers’ offense — that
Alex Van Pelt will not be back
in 1993.

“When it’s been this long,
you really don’t prepare your-
self for the eventuality that Alex

i:\ ..

Pitt’s Sp

won’t play next year,” Hackett
said. “Once we got a chance to
talk with John [at halftime], he
settled down and did some
positive things for us.”

One positive thing Ryan can
be credited with is engineering
the Panthers’ lone touchdown
of the dismal holiday after-
noon". After starting on their
own one-yard line, Ryan and
company sprinted 99 yards for
a score — capped by a
sparkling 66-yard pass-and-run
touchdown toss from Ryan to
Dietrich Jells.

For Ryan, the long ball was a
long time in coming — both on
the practice field and in a game
situation.

“It was nice to finally com-
plete a deep ball,” Ryan said.
“I’ve had a lot of trouble with
that since last spring.”

Witli bowl bids nothing more

ring

than a pipe dream, Hackett and
his coaching staff know the
future is now. Along with Ryan,
many other first-year players
will see ample time in the next
three games — giving the inex-
perienced some vital experi-
ence before they are thrown
into the-fire of a brutal 1995
schedule.

Hackett acknowledged that
although Ryan did not accom-
plish what he had hoped in
his substitute role, he was
more than satisfied with the
start of the likely number one
quarterback of the ‘93 Pitt
Panthers.

“He didn’t get us back in the
game — which is what we had
hoped —— but he certainly han-
dled himself in a very positive

-manner,” Hackett said. “That’s

something we can really build
on.”

into the starting line-up.

With some of the ques-
tions of Pitt’s starting five
answered and some still
left unsettled, Evans and
his Panthers look ahead
to an early Big East con-
ference start against
Georgetown Dec. 9. 4

“Having everybody pick
up a Big East game in
December is a little bit of
a problem,” Evans said.
“You have to be ready
that much sooner with
that much less time.”

Evans, 60-48 in Big East
competition, is in his sev-
enth year at the helm of
the Panthers and knows
how tough the Big East
conference can be.

“The Big East will be as
tough as it has ever
been,” Evans said.
“Obviously with Seton
Hall winning it last year

Basketball

and coming back with
everybody, they are pre-
dicted to win it again this
year.

“Syracuse and George-
town both had great
recruiting years. Con-
necticut has a good bit
back and BC [Boston
College] is picked up
there by a lot of people,”
Evans said. “So from top
to bottom‘ [the Big East]
may be as strong or
stronger than it has ever
been.”

, McNeal, who led the
team in points (492) and
rebounds (310) last -year,
has his goals set for this
year’s team already.
“\X/'e’re just trying to
take that next step and
get us to the tournament
[NCAA] this year,” McNeal
said. “But we got to get
this season going first and
try to win some games.”

Racism
Continued from page 5
WPXI—TV. ‘

The main issues during the
forum were how to deal with
racism with respect to the budget,
legislation, government agencies
and institutions, within education-
al programs, housing and welfare.

Francine Rowley of the Hill
District expressed concerns in
three specific areas where she
feels racism contributes to the lack
of concern; health care benefits
for part-time employees, drug
rehabilitation and education for
African—American self-economic
growth in the community.

Rowley was not satisfied with
Pitts” response, which was to take
initiative upon herself and petition

s_ for those programs she would like
to see put into action.

“I came to the meeting to voice
my opinion and have the existing
problems brought to the officials’
attention. I’m tired of lip service,
I want to see some action,”
Rowley said.

Another woman angered by
today’s more subtle racism was

Knight compared the want ads in

Geraldine Knight of Homewood._

newspapers years ago with the
message “coloreds need not
apply” to resumes.

“Today the resume serves the
same purpose,” Knight explained.
“Once they see what zip code you
live in, it becomes a ‘matter of dis-
crimination before they ever even
meet you.”

Other topics that were brought
up included low—income housing :
available within the city, discrimi-
nation within the banking industry
in regards to mortgage require-
ments and a lack of educational
and training facilities specialized
for African-American students.

Other citizens suggested that
once again it has come down to
the need for‘ violence to get the
point across. Some members of
the audience said since voices are
not being heard, gun shots will be
heard. 0

Mayor Pitts’ response to this
suggestion was simple disgust.

“I am a firm believer of non-vio-
lence,” he said. Hevalso said if the
fight against racism ever came to
violence, the minorities would not
_have a chance at victory because
they would be so greatly outnum-

ished construction of the dorms cafete-
ria has become an inconvenience and a
disappointment to many of the resi-
dents. The student also expressed con-
cern over the traffic outside the hall.

Director of Housing Robert Hopkins
said that a very serious commitment
was made to open Sutherland Hall by
Aug. 28.

“There was a trade-off involved in
making that decision,” Hopkins said. “If
we could have kept residents out. for
another month we probably could have
opened the cafeteria in early October.”

" Construction on the hall was delayed
further by the opening of Pittsburgh’s
new airport, Hopkins explained. Many
of the city construction workers were
drawn from the Oakland project to the
higher—paying airport labor jobs.

Hopkins said an alternative meal
plan was offered to residents of
Sutherland by way of box lunches or

box dinners but that the students
refused the offer._ _

The safety of students on University
Drive is also being looked into,
Hopkins said. The university has seen
how hospital traffic can be a serious
problem for students walking along the

road outside the dorm ancli;,isp»,atteinpt-,_;
ing to install a four—way stop‘Sign“an’cl' 

speed bumps near the hall, Hopkins
said. '

Another complaint on ..residence life
came from Tower A resident Carrie
McConnell, who said that it was unfair
that her entire ﬂoor be fined for contin-
uous false fire alarm calls.

“We wanted to know howswe can be

accused for something we weren’t even
there for,” McConnell said.

The RA on McConnell’s floor told the
residents that they were being fined
$1,000 for the false alarms — $500 a
call — McConnell said. She asked
Hopkins i_f there was any way to

American youths
Africa. ’

She also stated that a black racist does not
exist, because racism is based on a system of
power to which African people do not have
access. “There is no such thing as a black

 

Souﬁah  

Continued from page 1

Sister Souljah also outlined the symptoms of
war and some solutions, citing that after visiting
colleges across the country she estimates there
is a four to one ratio of black women to men
on northern college campuses and an 11 to one

ratio on southern college campuses.

She stated that black men are “missing in
in a war that nobody has officially
declared and that nobody wants to believe is
going on.” Sister Souljah explained, “War is
declared on you any time anybody takes from
you that which is rightfully yours. She faulted
the American_educational system as being
a “killing field” for African minds, in that it
does not teach African youths, nor white
, about the true history of

action 

racist. Racism is a system of power.”

She suggested that some of the solutions to
the problems that Africans face today were (1)
_to rebuild African male/female relationships; (2)
"to rebuild African businesses; and (3) to orga-
nize more African-centered political platforms.

The final solution proposed was for African
students to stop feeling guilty about believing
 goodconquers evil, and
ultimately, God is far more powerful than" the

appeal that fine.

Hopkins said that for each false
alarm, the Housing Department was
charged $500 by the city of Pittsburgh.

“If your floor is the site of multiple
false alarms, really the only way that
‘they’re going to get stopped is to catch

tgythed,-people pulling them,” Hopkins
saidf"‘Tl1ere has been some discussion
on charging the floors, particularly
when they tend to be focused‘ on one
or two ﬂoors, [but] we are not charging
the ﬂoors.”

McConnell said that her ﬂoor of the
Towers should be made more secure.

Several students in the audience
agreed with McConnell that the floors
of the Tower dorms_ lack security and

that many keys open doors throughout.

the buildings.

Several female students complained
about Tower door locks. One student
suggested a key card system as an easi-
er way to access the dorms.

Justice John Marshall to
enforce one of his own
decisions and that
Congress ignored the
Dred Scott decision that
declared slaves to be
property and passed leg-
islation to end slavery in
1862.

Perry said both Ronald
Reagan and George
Bush, two pro-life candi-
dates, could have
ignored Roe vs. Wade
and turned the decision
on abortion over to the
states. Perry said that
there is no place in the
Constitution that reads
that the Supreme Court
can interpret the law.

At the beginning of
the meeting, Cohen
endorsed Student ‘
Government Board can-
didates Thomas J.
Grassia and David
Gleason Ott. Cohen said
that they will both help
the group.

idea for the forum originated from?’
gas leak incident in Forbes Hall. 

 
    

“This is an excellent opportunityl 

students to voice any coniplaints

RSA also endorsed Student

Government Board candidates Jacob,

Anthony Moody and David Ott at the

Near the end of meeting, students
said they would like to have this type
