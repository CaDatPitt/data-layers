With a $70,000 budget and more
than 150 students expressing
interest, Pitt’s Honors Program is
underway this term, according to
Dr. Glenn A. Stewart, an associate
professor of physics at Pitt and
director of the Honors Program.

“We expect the honors courses to
have three characteristics,” Stew-
art said, “that they be challenging,
demanding, and stimulating.”

Stewart said one of the biggest
concerns of the program is the
quality of its teaching.

' B‘ We’re asking the students to

take a harder way through the
University, and in return, want to
guarantee their work will be
worthwhile. That means good
teaching, and we’re serious about
it,”.Stewart said.

The honors courses are intended
to have minimal prerequisites,
enabling them to suit distribution
requirements. Students enrolled in
the courses will be credited with
honors on their transcripts. The

ﬁurse. grading will be standard

student government structure and
tuition hikes.

Barent, a former member of the
Student Government Allocations
Committee, said he sees himself as
a potential president who would be
an “active mediator” between
students and the board.

“.If the students don’t come to
me,” he said,‘ “I’ll go to them
through surveys, suggestion boxes
and a complaint center.”

Barent said the SGB should be a
“resource center” that would help
student organizations to create
programs. “This would lessen the
political activity that seems to be
counter-productive,” he added.

Moreover, Barent said, commu-
nication between board members
must be improved, and the
allocations process should be
strengthened by educating student
groups about it. He listed" as
funding priorities student services
and “innovative, diverse program-
ming” like student talent shows.

Barent said that. if elected, he
would demand reports from stud-

letter grades, unless the faculty
wishes to change the grading.

“We told the faculty the students
enrolled in these courses are not the
typical cross section of the
undergraduate student population,
and we expect the grading to reﬂect
that,” Stewart said. “We don’t
want to advocate grading on a
straight curve basis, but on an
absolute standard.”

Currently, there are 15 classroom
courses in the program, and 10
independent study courses that deal
with the natural sciences, social
sciences and humanities.

When the Honors Program was
proposed last year, it stirred
controversy among the student
body and administration, who were
concerned the program would foster
elitism. M

“I don’t think the basis of this
program is elitism at all,” Stewart
said. Morally, it’s utilitarianism.
What we’re saying is that we are
obligated at the University to allow
any student who pays tuition to
achieve his potential.” *

ents holding positions on the
Senate Council, discuss cutbacks
with administrators, write monthly
reports and attend meetings of
student organizations.

Discussing tuition, Barent lauded
November's student rally in Harris-
burg and added he would push for
increased student registration and
the creation of a permanent lobby to
deal with all legislative action of
student interest.

On other topics, Barent said the
student activity fee should be
increased, if it is used to renovate
the Student Union. He also said the
SGB should speak out on issues not
directly related to Pitt only if asked
to do so by a student organization.

Barent said his top priority, if
elected, would be to “do the things I
say I’ll do, and, if not, make known
the reasons why.”

Baylson, a current board mem-
ber, said his priorities would center
on academic issues like the

was formed last year to outline the
then-prospective Honors Program.
The task force recommended
institution of separate Honors
Program facilities, which would
include ofﬁces as well as seminar
rooms, a reading room, a study-fac-
ulty lounge and a computer room
containing a dial-access computer
terminal for honor student use.

“Right now, the Honors Program
doesn’t have any special type of
facilities,” Stewart said. “We’re
living on borrowed space in the
Cathedral of Learning.”

As for the future of the Honors
Program, Stewart seems optimistic.
We received about 50 course
proposals for the program. With
only two advertisements in The Pitt
News, we’ve gotten between 150
to 170 students who are interested
in the program.

“Students really like the idea of
courses of guaranteed quality,
which is what the program is all
about,” Stewart said.

Pitt ‘Stop’ Pushed by SGB

By DAVID 
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Student Government Board
is seeking the installation of a safety
signal on Bigelow Boulevard at the
crosswalk between the Cathedral of
Learning and the Student Union.

The safety signal, possibly a
yellow ﬂashing light or a stop sign,
would help to make the heavily
trodden crosswalk safer for pedes-
trians, according to SGB member
Dave Hesidence.

“We contacted the City Traffic
Planning Office (TPO), ” Hesidence
said, “but their response was
negative.” -

According to Hesidence, TPO
sighted the fact that few accidents
have occurred at the crosswalk.
“Does somebody have to get killed
before they put a sign‘ up?”
Hesidence said. '

Hesidence said the board then

    

contacted Mayor Caliguiri’s office,
hoping to inﬂuence the TPO into
taking action. The mayor promised
to conduct a study, but results won’t
be known for at least a month,
Hesidence said.

He added if the Mayor’s study ..

does not show the need to have a
safety signal installed, SGB will
bring the matter before City
Council.

The University is studying the
situation, and may install either an
overpass or an underpass to
alleviate the danger, Hesidence
said. The project, part of the
Student Union renovation plan, will
not be initiated for at least a year.

tions,‘ and a “new approach” to
programming that would offer
students entertainment not avail-
able elsewhere in Pittsburgh.

‘ ‘I’d like to see the outside cafe be
continued, and weekend musical
festivals be created,” he said.

Baylson said this year’s board
members, including, himself, failed
to coordinate several SGB standing:
committees. He suggested an
advisory board he formed to share
ideas and deal with problems
common to the student government-
organizations.

Reﬂecting on last year’s approp-
riations battle, Baylson expressed

_. disappointment that Pittfs lobbying
~ -2 effort encroached on time that could .
have been =-used by; the SGB on

other matters. ,

Baylson said University lobbyists
have been unsuccessful in the state
capital, adding,‘ “We, as student
leaders, must examine the Univer-

’ sity’s lobbying effort and, if it’s not

worthwhile, we should consider
how to improve _it.”

Baylson also suggested the
Student Government Task Force on
Higher Education be tied to a

permanent Public Affairs Govern-
ment Relations Committee. In
addition, he said, another lobby
should be formed to deal with
city-related issues like parking and
University expansion.

Baylson maintained his board
tenure has led to familiarity with a
number of administrators here, and
added, “The Student Government
president should be a coordinator of
ideas, and serve as an effective
ﬁlter between students and the
administration.”

Baylson has been endorsed by the
Interfratemity Council and the
Resident Student Associaiton.

A member of the Allocations

Committee and co-chairman of last’

term’s Homecoming Committee,

Lash said he sees himself as a’

‘ ‘leader who listens.’ ’

“I would deﬁnitely delegate
authority, and make the board work
towards a common goal,’.’ he said.

Lash cited internal woes as the
major problem facing the SGB.

“They had trouble getting seven
people together. That’s proven by
the resignations (of Ahmie Baum
and JoAnne Levi°on).” '

“The board should decide it's
direction and make a game plan.”

Lash said his main priorities
would be to learn what students
want and to speed up the allocations
process.

“It’s possible to go six weeks
without getting anything done,”
Lash added.

He also said substantial amounts
of allocated funds had eventually
been returned because projects

never were completed.

Lash said programming should
promote more Lower, Lounge
concerts and “group-week type”
activities involving different stu-
dent organizations. “It’ll put more
activities on campus, and the
students will learn from it,” he said.

He added a committee should be
formed to guard against conflicts in
scheduling.

To combat tuition hikes, Lash

said, students continually should
lobby in Harrisburg. He added the
board should inform students which
legislators traditionally support
higher education.

On other issues, Lash called for
more bus lines -connecting the
campus to the city. He also said
that, if elected, he would investi-
gate prices in the Campus
Bookcenter and deal with problems
of on-campus parking and tenant-
landlord disputes.

SGB Election Roundup

By RICH HARRY

Pin News Staff Writer

With the stage almost set for this year’s Student Government
Board elections, 10 candidates. including an incumbant. are cam-

paigning for the six seats.

If things go according to schedule. polls will open Wednesday in
the Cathedral. Student Union, Towers Lobby. Hillmafl Library
and Lothrop Hall. Elections will continue Thursday. and votes

will be tallied that night.

Board members carry one vote each in three notable areas:
student activities. funding, the recognition of student organizations
and’ the appointment of student government committee members.
They represent students on a number of University groups, in-
cluding the University Senate and Senate Council.

Over the weekend, in the midst of their campaigning, the 10
candidates gave The Pitt News their views on several issues. in-
cluding Pitt tuition. the structure of student government and

University-community relations.

The interviews. listed in alphabetical order, follow:

DIANE BEHERS

Behers, who
co-chairs the
Student Gov
ernment Com-.
muter Commit-
tee, said she
would open
communication
between the
board, its com- ,
mittees, and"
students by holding meetings at
different times and locations.

She emphasized increasing ser-
vices for commuters, listing more
daytime programming, additional
enclosed bus shelters and reduced
cafeteria rates for commuters.

Behers said the larger student
organizations should receive their
own budgets, and that remaining

‘funds should be allocated to the
smaller groups.

She said she would not increase
the $12 activity fee, saying, “That
would just upset a lot of students
who aren’t getting anything from it
have.“

Commenting on Pitt’s lobbying
effort this year, Behers said it was
“last-minute” and should have
been followed by more letter
writing. “Lobbying this year should
be increased, and begin earlier,”
she added.

Behers also said SGB should not
take a strong stand on issues not
directly related to Pitt. “We should
be concerned with what’s happen-
ing inside the University, ’ ’ she said.

Behers is running on a slate that
includes presidential hopeful Max
Lash and board candidates Stan

 Galanski and Cleo Sumpter.

STAN GALANSKI

Galanski, a _
Pitt lobbyist ,
this year, said
his top priority
would be to
organize stu-
dents into a 5
political force.

He called for 
amassiveregis- M :
tration drive that would include Pitt,
Penn State, Temple and Lincoln
Universities, and said the Student
Task Force on_Higher Education
should be made a permanent
standing committee.

Galanski also said student
services should be expanded-—-in-
cluding later runs by the campus
bus—and immediate student ser-
vices should be increased.

Moreover, Galanski said, pro-
gramming should be increased.
“Major concerts are not going to
happen here. I’d like to see smaller,
Lower Lounge concerts.”

“The long-range programs are
ﬁne and shouldn’t be cut,’_’ he said,
“but lets give the students

something now.”

In addition, Galanski said SGB
should improve its relations with
student organizations. He suggest-
ed ‘SGB meetings be widely
publicized and locations be rotated,
and said the allocations process
should be modiﬁed.

“Too many times, programs are
cut that are needed,” Galanski
added. _ _

Galanski, who is running a joint
campaign with Lash, Behers and
Sumpter, has been endorsed by the
Interfraternity Council and the
Resident Student Association
(RSA).

DAVE GOLDMAN

Goldman, a
member of the
Committee on g
Student Organ- 1" ‘
izations, said
his priorities in-
clude g strength-

dent Assembly
and working on ,,.. :
faculty evaluation and the English
competency requirement.

He said the structure of Student
Government is “basically good,”
but added that he would scrutinize
the way student organizations are
formally recognized by student
government.

‘ ‘I’d also explore the possibility of
the board being represented by the
different schools,” Goldman add-
ed.

Concerning tuition, he said the
board should review Pitt’s budget.
“It’s our school, and as student
representatives, we should see the
best possible budget with the lowest
possible tuition, while looking to see
that the University doesn’t drasti-
cally cut back,” Goldman added.

He also said the board should not

" take a stand on issues not directly

affecting Pitt, but indicated it
should become involved in Pitt-
community affairs. '

Goldman also stated he was
against ahike in the student activity
fee, saying, “You may alienate a
percentage of the students, and
spend the fee on something they
don’t want.”

Goldman has been endorsed by
the Interfraternity Council.

DAVE HESIDENCE

    

Hesidence,
an incumbant,
listed priorities _
ranging from '
academic ser- '
vices to a broad-
ened _bus sys-
tem on and
around cam-
pus.

   

He said information concernig
University operations like registra-

tion and add/drop processing
should“be centralized with cat-

   

lialoguing and. use ofav-computer; ~ - -

~.*.‘-, . ~w.;»‘”.   23-‘ 9',‘§=,"«,:“.v_'b_ 

-.

Hesidence also said the Univer-
sity should train its staff to work
more effectively with students, and
bolster its advising program
through the hiring of professional
advisors.

He said he favored abandoning
the major concert business, adding
that experts should be hired as
advisors in to programming.

“The programs also should be
decided by the major student
organizations,” he added. “They
should be more diversiﬁed, too.”

Commenting on the appropria-
tions ﬁght, Hesidence noted he
helped form the Task Force on
Higher Education with board
member Chip Hubbard. 1

“It should have started earlier,”
Hesidence said of Pitt’s lobbying
effort. “I now understand lobbying
is a year-round effort.”

Hesidence, who is running on a
slate with presidential candidate

g Josh Baylson and board hopeful
Sharon Starzynski, has been
endorsed by IFC and RSA.

JAN MEDOFF

Medoff said
his top priority
would be to
work towards 
discontinuing ;;
the plus/minus ’
grading system
CAS reinstated
last term.  _ _

“Ninety-fivew p rcen o e
students Italked to don’t want it,”
Medoff said, “and student govern-
ment should do what the students
want.”

He said the structure of SGB is
sound, and that its major problem is
student disinterest. He claimed the
board ignores the recommendations
of the Allocations Committee.

“The board should choose
personnel whose recommendations
it could trust. Then, they could
spend less time on the budget and
more time on other things, ’ ’ Medoff
added.

He termed campus programming
“not up to par.”

‘‘I can see why it , was phased
out, ’ ’ Medoff said. ‘ ‘We should run
a shuttle bus to the Civic Arena for

 

,. concerts whose tickets are sponsor-

ed by Pitt. We_ should have a Syria
Mosque concert open only to Pitt
students.”

Medoff said he would continue
lobbying efforts in Harrisburg and
urge the University to be “a better
neighbor” to Oakland.

Also, he said, the board should
take a stand on issues not directly’
related to Pitt. “Many students are
politically aware. . . Student Govern-
ment is something they could rally
around.”

Medoff has been endorsed by
RSA.

SAM MENDICINO

Mendecino,
former presi-
dent of the
Medical Action
Committee,
said his prior-
ities would be to
address prob-
lems of tuition
and campus
crime and to 
educate students on health and
advising services. ’

He said he would employ a
two-front-attack—here and in the
state capital—to ﬁght a tuition hike.

“l’d learn which legislators are
for Pitt, and then inform the
students. We also can use the doors
to the administration that have been
opened b”v nast boards.” Mende-
cino said. “I really don’t think any

the University to the fullest,” he
added.

Speaking on allocations, Mende-
cino said he would survey students
to learn where they want the money
spent, and added that budget
decisions should be left largely to
the board’s standing allocations
committee.

He put added emphasis on
student services. ‘‘I would use all
resources on campus to educate
students on available services. I
also would set up a research/ input
committee that would have repre-
sentatives from different student
groups.”

Moreover, Mendecino said the
board should be a liasion between
students and the community, and
said the board should support
issues that touch persons“‘our age,
like the drinking issue.”

CHERYL MOORE

Moore said
she would open
the lines of
communication
between the
SGB and stu-
dents as part of
her platform.

To improve
SGB, she said
she would push for a credited course

 

the topic. She also said a student
ombudsman should be appointed to
student government to act as a
liasion between‘ the board and
student organizations.

Moore’s proposals for program-
ming include a centralized ofﬁce
that would oversee operations. ‘ ‘It’s
good to have diverse programs, but
not repetitive, overlapping ones,”
she said.

She added that she would aim for
all-night movies, and for reduced
rates in the Student Union
recreation center.

To ﬁght tuition, costs, Moore
would push for voter registration
campaigns, she said, and a political
action committee formed by various
student groups.

Moore also said SGB should
‘become active in community affairs
if they affect students, and
expressed a willingness to support

conﬂict with neighbors.

She said the board should not,“

take stands on issues not affecting
students here. “We’d be stretching
ourselves thin if we did. How can we
be effective then?”

BERNIE Popko

  
 
  

Popko, what,
has served on _
various SGB:
committees,
calls for sweep- *
ing changes in
the board’s:
structure. .

He said the ;
powers of SGB president should be
strengthened, and a new Vice
Presidency be formed. He said he
would provide student input into
salaries paid to board members.

Popko said the allocations
process should be streamlined. ‘ ‘I’d
stress greater ﬂexibility with the
initial allocation, and then follow-up
where the money goes.”

He also said he would distribute
student discount cards, which have
been withheld by SGB.

Speaking on tuition, Popko said
SGB should be “credible enough”
to take the student’s case to Pitt’s
Board of Trustees and to the
Legislature. _ .

“The board draws up facts, but
doesn’t know how to use them,” he
said.

He‘also said he opposes the board
taking stands on issues not related
to Pitt.

“We’re working with limited
resources,” he said. “If we support
issues like Kent State, the board
could leave issues here unattend-
ed.”

Popko also said he approved the
board’s move to pull out of the
major concert business. He added
that he favors Lower Lounge
programs and a centralized pro-
gramming ofﬁce.

SHARON STARZYNSKI

Starzynski
said she be-
lieves the board
is an “elitist”
group whose
size should be
increased.

“Not enough
people are 'in-
volved,” she
said. “The number is minute to the

 

‘ total student body.”

Starzynski called for the creation
of a “Committee on Committees”
to serve as an advisory board for
placing students on SGB commit-
tees.

She listed as priorities “tangible
services” for students and a heated
campus bus stop.

Starzynski said more contact
between student organizations is
needed when allocating funds.

“If the board knew a student
group’s needs, the process could be
quickened,” she added.

Starzynski said a public relations
committee should be formed to deal
with community issues.
community has a viewpoint of the
University, and we should point out
its good points.” i

Starzynski is running on a slate
with Josh Baylson and Dave
Hesidence. She has been endorsed
by IFC.

CLEO SUMPTER

   

Sumpter, a?
member of the .
Legal Aware
ness Commit
tee, said SGB 5
should be more 5
open to stu ’_
dents, ‘and?
blamed the 
board for stu
dent apathy. 5‘:

“Students don’t know Studen
Government at all,” she said. “I’d
open meetings by having them
where students could atten'c1...like
"in the dorms.”

She also said the board doesn’t
work together. “There's been too
much conﬂict. Board members and
the president should work as one.”

To improve the allocations
process, she said each student

. organization should place a repre-

sentative on the standing Alloca-
tions Committee.

Sumpter also proposed distribut-
ing free parking permits to
commuters, and said a new parking
lot should be built. .

To combat tuition hikes, Sumpter
said
students to vote. She added that the
board must show its strength as a
governing body to Pitt administra-
tors.

“If the administration sees that
the students are behind the board,”
Sumpter said, “they would have a»
different attitude, and studen.s.
would have more say.”

SGB Endorsements

Reversing a decision made late last week, we have decided to run
our endorsements of candidates for Student Government Board
today rather than two days from‘ now. If we waited until ~Wed-
nesday, the polls could be open for several hours before The Pitt

 

' News is available on campus, and this, we think, would be unfair to
i v_ the candidates we have endorsed.

. Although the quality of this year’s candidates varies widely, the
field is, in general, superior to the one students chos_e;f_romila'st
If students take the time to look beyondthe attrac-
tiveness of campaign posters to the qualifications of the candidates
themselves, we think the 1978 board could be the best in recent
years. If they don’t, it could be one of the worst.

Based on extensive interviews with each candidate,.and on the
candidates’ brief presentations to our editorial board yesterday,

The Pitt News endorses the following people:

SGB President: Max Lash.
SGB Members: Stan Galanski, Dave Hesidence, Sam Mendicino
and Bernie Popko.

Max Lash has the self-assurance and amiability to function well
as president of a board made up of opinionated and independent-
minded individuals. His experience on the Allocations Committee
should help him in dealing with the biggest morass in student
government. He favors most of the best programs of the present
board——English competency requirements and the Undergraduate
Academic Review, for instance—and supports voter registration
efforts and continuous lobbying in Harrisburg. Lash’s ideas on
improved bus transportation to outlying areas are among the most
interesting we’ve heard, and he would be a positive force in com-
muter affairs.

Stan Galanski has stressed the political mobilization of the
student body, and should prove an able leader in this nearly im-
possible but necessary task. With University appropriations—and
therefore tuition——so contingent on the whims of a highly
politicized State Legislature, -Galanski’s ideas for statewide
student political coordination are vigorth a try. His support for
black studies, ‘commuter programs and programming innovations
recommend him as an active and independent board member.

Dave,Hesiden.ce has spent a year on .the board, learning the in-
tricacies of student government and the University in general, and
the experience he has gained could be put to good use on the new
board. He has excellent ideas on academic advising, information
dissemination and campus transportation, and should be given the
opportunity to make thema reality. Hesidence has a good under-

standing of relations between the University and the surrounding

community, and his influence could be instrumental in easing ten-
sions in this area.

Sam Mendicino would bring a research orientation to the
He has

ment to publicizing services already available could make him an
immediately effective board member. Mendicino’s intelligence,
tact and diplomatic approach to problems could help to avert or at

.;least alleviate the kinds. of personiality conflicts that have plagued

the present board. '

Bernie Popko would give the board the kiridiofjactivistic shaking .

up it needs if it is to be both innovative and accountable to its con-

stituency. Enthusiastic to the point of abrasiveness, Popko has put I

tremendous" effort into his campaign, and is byfar the best-
prepared and best-informed non-incumbent candidate. He is
committed to .getting the Student Assembly on its feet, and has the
energy to wade through the ‘Student Government. bureaucracy in

The Conservative Press

By GARY GOVERT

“There is an anticonservative
bias within the national press,”
Patrick ‘Buchanan recently wrote,
and last Wednesday I began an
examination into the truth of the
former Nixon speechwriter’ s claim.
The basic humanity of journalists
makes bias unavoidable, I said, and
I granted Buchanan the possibility
that there may be more liberal
publications than there are Wall
Street Journals.

My acquiescence to Buchanan’s
rhetoric was predicted, of course,
on a ﬁne-tuned definition of the
word ‘ ‘ anticonservative. ’ ’
sumed that he, along with most
other Americans, would agree that

“anticonservative” can be trans-

lated as. ‘=‘liberal.”

The question now becomes,
should we accept that translation?
Should the words anticonservative
and liberal, in an accurate view of
things, be synonymous?

‘Although I accepted the transla-
tion on Wednesday in order to make
a point about bias, I think it would
be a mistake to do so on a regular

I as—i

basis. The liberal label is simply too
easy to come by, and therefore has
come to mean something quite
different from true anticonserva-
tism.

For instance, although they agree
on fundamental economic and polit-
ical questions (i.,e., adherence to
capitalism and belief in democratic
individualism), the Republican
party generally is considered
conservative, while the Democrats
are known as liberals. It’s the slight
leftward drift of the Democrats that
does it, their self-styled populism
and so-called ‘ ‘progressiveness’ ’—

V not any basic difference at. the

philosophical roots. Anythingimore
than a relatively small, peripheral
move away from the - status
quo—anything that is truly antieon-
,servative—is considered radical,‘
not-liberal. ‘In America, at least, a

liberal is a conservative with X. a

facelift.

The fact of the matter is thatthere
is virtually no real anticonservative
force in the United States. The
reasons for this are many; Robert
Penn Warren captured a goodly
number of them in his ‘lengthy

essay, “The’ Legacy of the Civil
War. ’ ’ America's history of political
pragmatism, our preoccupation
with material progress——these and
other factors have contributed to the
evolution of a nation that is now and
has been for decades conservative
to the core.

(Some may argue that, although
the campuses have reverted to

' 1950’s style apathy, the 1960’s

prove that a real anticonservative
force can and has existed in the
United States. I don’t think so.
Rather than as a radical alternative
to the dominant forces in American
life, I see-those days of love and rage
as something more like the New
Individualism or the New Material-

ism-—-same old values, new expres-
lsion.) I

.The United States has been
graced with an admirable, albeit
fluctuating, spirit of toleration, but
this has not been enough to nurture
any real challenge to the American
Way. This is one of the few
countries in the world where
Marxists remain a miniscule and
impotent presence. (The other

economic defeats is ‘the growing

(OPEC). These 13 oil-exporting
countries of the third world united
in 1973 to wrest control ‘of their oil

oil giants. They use this wealth to
build up‘ their agriculturei and
industry, and to ‘free themselves

countries are mostly right-wing
dictatorships.) Americans feel they
have gained much from the very
system Marxism challenges, and
the suburbanite with two cars and a
racquet club membership really
doesn’t have much time for the
ravages of capitalism in Latin
America. Neither does the mill-
worker who wants the same things,
and has to worry about layoffs. On
the other end of the authentically
anticonservative spectrum from the
Marxists, very small communities
of Christian radicals are popping up
in isolated pockets of the country,
but word of them is lost in the crush
of politically conservative evangeli-
cals.

The way “conservatism with a
facelift” operates in the liberal
press is not difficult to see. The New
York Times runs an article on the
Marcos regime in the Philippines,
mentioning his “land reforms,” but
not mentioning that those “re-
forms” actually have improved his
balance of payments while worsen-
ing the plight of the poor.Newsweek

Coal Miners
Need Strike
To Succeed

The BCOA wants to strap the
miners with a commercial in-
surance plan. This only shows that
they reject all responsibility for the
wellbcing of the worker‘. Injuries
in the Coalﬁelds are seven times
higher than industry. In the ﬁrst
eight months of 1977 alone. 99
workers were killed on the job.
These beneﬁts will become even
more important to the miners in the
years to come. as the owners speed
up production.

The miners also are demanding
an end to the harrassment of
workers absent from their jobs.
The BCOA can ﬁre a worker after
two consecutive absences. They
now are pushing for penalties for
“exccssive" work—missing (deﬁned
so far as over two days a month).
This is part of their overall
“stabilization" plan. It gives the
bosses an easy way to prevent
workers from staging w/alkouts over
unsafe conditions and harrassment
on the job.

Most importantly, the miners are
demanding the right _to wage
strikes to settle grievances on a
grass-roots level. The Arbitration
Review Board, set up in the 1974,
contract. has determined that local
strikes are illegal. So are
advocating a strike, handing out
literature, calling for a strike or
picketing at a mine where you do
not work.

As it stands now, all local
disputes are settled through griev-
ance procedures that always end up
in arbitration, where they drag on
forever. The Arbitration Review
Board has settled less than 200
grievances (usually in favor of the
owners) and has a current backlog
of over a thousand cases. The
companies love arbitration becai. xe
it splits the cost with the union.
while the contested practice re-
mains in effect at the workplace.

The miners face a long hard
struggle to win these demands.
The primary users of coal, steel and
utility companies have built up
four-month stockpiles of coal in
anticipation of the strike. On the
day the strike began, Dec. 6, the

. miners lost all health beneﬁts, and

they have no strike fund. " In
February, retired miners will get
their pensions cut off. —

To win. the miners will need the
informed support of broad sectors

of the American people. Informa- "

tion is the very thing the
corporately controlled mediawill
black out and distort.
are already being portrayed as
violent and unreasonalbe men,
whose struggle has nothing in
common with the interests of the

V American people.

The miners are ﬁghting for their
lives, and for the life of their union.
They are ﬁghting for basic rights
of all working people. Under
capitalism. the working class owns
nothing but its labor _power. which
they must well to survive. The
strike. the withholding of labor
power to wrest concessions from
the capitalists. is the basic, weapon
of the workers‘ struggle. Such
things as a minimum wage. social
security. unemployment compen-
sation. job safety. sick leave and
the right to unionizc would have
been impossible to obtain. and are
likewise impossible to defend.
without the strike.

The BCOA attack on the UMWA.
one of the most militant unions in
labor history. is part of an overall
attack on the rights of all working
people. A

By The Associated Press

He thought and he talked and he
ran like the wind. In victory, he
was ecstatic. In defeat, he bled but
not for long. He had something
inside, an inner gyro, a self-sealing
mechanism which enabled him to
look at the same set of facts and
replace gloom with cheer.

He was almost never without
momentum. He was always his
own best cheerleader. History and
the election returns might easily
have made him a Hamlet. Instinct
insisted on an Ariel, an aging but
blithe spirit.

He was the heir apparent of a

‘liberal legacy that began with

Franklin Roosevelt and stretched
through Harry Truman, John
Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson
until, with Vietnam, there was
almost nothing to inherit. He

reamined undaunted.
Other men ran for office. Hubert

Horatio Humphrey ﬂew, soared
with what he called the antics, the
crowds, the cheers, the talent of a
cold audience, the reaching hands
of faithless strangers, the push and
the pull, the whole mind-scramb-
ling, bone-wearying, lunatic caco-
phony of a champaign.

“The bells are ringing and the
battle is on,” he said of the inner
and outerman, eyes popping, fists
pumping, adrenalin galloping,
altogether corny and contagious.

And yet the same man was
equally visceral and ‘ believable
when he ﬁnally discovered early in
1976 the joys of not running for
president after three tries. While
all others around him on the
Democratic side of the aisle
seemed to be salivating for the job,
Hubert Humphrey looked at the
political realities and decided he

had had it. He was turning nothing
down, but he ﬁnally was not
running, and in that he felt a new
liberation.

“I am not a candidate,” he
exalted. “I don’t want anything. I
don’t need anything. I feel better
than ever, here in my heart, my
mind, my body. I can speak very
frankly. lt’s not difficult now to
stand up to someone and say, ‘I
can’t agree with you,’ or ‘I can’t
do that."‘

Free at last? Not quite.

In April 1976, just before the
New Jersey primary, the polls
looked promising, friends brought
pressure, the experts agreed that
this was the last chance to stop
Jimmy Carter, and Hubert Humph-
rey wavered with the hunger of
lifetime. I

“But then I got myself under
control. I still had the desire, but I
knew I shouldn’t be in it,
politically, emotionally and phys-

tally. If you’ve tried to climb the
mountain before and didn’t make it
and now you're considerably older,
maybe it’s better if you just sit back
and look at the mountain, yearn a
little but not try to climb it.”

Two weeks after the 1976
election, six weeks after a cancer
operation, the unsinkable student
of disappointment tried to console
his old friend, Jerry Ford, on his
defeat. He pointed out to the
‘rejected president that he had
restored public trust in the White
House. Ford was only partially
consoled. Humphrey tried again.

“Mr. President, you’ve had 21/:
years in this house. I’d have given
10 years of my life to have had two
days or two weeks here.”

That did it. Ford was now
smiling, and two of the most

amiable losers in history laughed
together.

Two months later, now terribly
gaunt but still smiling, Hubert
Humphrey was up there on the
inaugural stand before the Capitol
watching yet another man take the
oath for the job he had coveted so
long. How did he feel?.

“I would have loved to have been
president. It was the great
heartache of my life that I didn’t
make it, because I think I would
have done good for this country. I
really believe that. But I was not
destined to be.”

Time and perspective finally
closed the old wound. He recalled,
a dinner-with W. Averell Harri-
man, another giant of his time who
never made it to the top.

“I came away from that everning
thinking what he had meant to this
country and what his life had been,
and I realized you didn’t have to be
president to be a great man‘ and
respected by your fellow citizens.”

Twice the Senate of the United
States came to itsfeet in standing
ovations for Hubert Humphrey no
one could forget. There was
sustenance, too, in the corridors.

f‘I’ve had some marvelous
consolation prizes,” he said. “I
just can’t tell you how much it
means to me. I notice when I walk
around now in the Senate halls how
considerate people are of me. They
ask about me. They are concerned,
and I know that. I'm part of the
history of this place.”

He recalled complaining to his
father once about not getting
enough sleep.

“Listen son,” he father said.

“You don ’t need more sleep.
You ought to learn to stay out of

bed. People die there. Life_ is

Hubert Horatio Humphrey, the “Happy Warrior,” in better. days. The Minnesota
senator ran for the Presidency twice and failed. Humphrey recently said of his
losses, “i would have loved to have been President. It was the great heartache
of my lite that I didn’t make it, because i think I would have done good for this

country. I really believe that.”

awareness, and if you're not aware
you’re not alive.”

Hubert Humphrey smiled with
the memory. ‘

“So I was ﬁguring it up the other
day,” he said. “I figure I’ve lived
a least 100 years.

Sorority Sisters
Murdered

By The Associated Press

TALLAHASSEE, Fla.——A club-
wielding attacker crept into a
sorority house at Florida State
University early Sunday and
brutally beat four young women
while they slept, killing two of
them, police said.

A short time later, someone who
police believe was the same
intruder broke into a nearby home
and severely beat another young
woman student, authorities said.

Police said the other women in
the Chi Omega sorority house were
asleep during the attacks, but the
assailant was spotted by one of the
residents as she returned shortly
after 3 a.m. from a date.

“She saw a man running down
the stairs and out the front door.
He was carrying a club or a limb or
a piece of wood of some sort,” said
police spokesman Carl Swanson.

Swanson said she heard moaning
in the upstairs rooms; found the
injured women and called police.

It concers Pennsylvania’s 184-
year-old Blue Laws, which make

An attempt to repeal the laws

And lawmakers are not about to

You can buy pornography, but

“It’s absoliitely insane,” added

Manion, calling the Blue Laws “an

Though the Puritan edicts have

If you’re a junior or a senior majoring in math, physics or
engineering, the Navy has a program you should know about.
It’s called‘ the Nuclear Propulsion Officer Candidate-

Collegiate Program (N UPOC-C for short) and if you qualify,
you can earn as much as $650 a month right through your
senior year. Then after 16 weeks of Officer Candidate School,
you’ll receive an additional year of advanced technical
education. This would cost you thousands in_a civilian school,
but in the Navy, we pay you. And at the end of the year of

It isn’t easy. There are fewer than 400 openings and only
one of every six applicants will be selected. But if you make
it, you’ll have qualified for an elite engineering training
program. With unequaled hands-on responsibility, a $24,000
salary in four years, and gilt-edged qualifications for jobs
in private industry should you decide to leave the Navy

Bored With 

US Crowds

By The Associalcd Prcxs

SAN FRANClSCO—The Sex
Pistols, the punk rockers from
Britain who say they like their fans
to wear safety pins in their noses,
were disappointed during a U.S.
tour becuase American audiences
were “too tame,” their manager
says.

‘‘I think they hated the entire

tour," Malcolm McLaren said in a

telephone interview Sunday.

“It’s been an eyeopener for the
band to realize England is a helluva
lot freer and a helluva lot more
intelligent than America.”

The rebel band ended its seven
city tour Saturday night before
3,500 people in San Francisco's
Winterland auditorium.

At Winterland, hundred of
young followers wore more than
safety pins, uncombed their hair in
proper punk style and bounced up
and down-pogoed-just like British
punksters.

But McLaren complained it
wasn't good enough. The crowd
was too tame. he said. And he

called the steady exchange of spit, 

tomatoes and other ammunition
exchanged by the Pistols and the
audience “a little to lightweight."
After the show, according to
McLaren, band leader Johnny
Roteen “said he thought it was all
very boring. . .The only time the Sex
Pistols enjoy a show is when the
audience gets on stage and takes
‘over. The point of their show is to
make as much chaos as possible."
Asked to describe what would
have happened if the show had

‘ gone right, McLaren replied

simply: “Perhaps you would not
have seen the San Francisco

W interland anymore.’ ’ _

Kiss’s sold out Friday the _13th
Civic Arena concert was Broadway
Rock’n’Roll .

The only way to get an accurate
description and feel for these four
average yet creative musicians
fromthe heart of New York City is
to see them and their fans work out
in concert.

Kiss has gone far beyond the
normal context of rock’n’roll stars,
and, with its thousands of rabid
young fans, is a fantasy-evoking
in stitution .

In concert, the band was heavy
on the black leather outfits,
makeup, exploding ﬁre ﬂashes,
elevated drum kits and heavy, loud
and abrasive street rock.

Since Kiss is always lambasted
for its harsh and simple music,
most people above the age of
puberty look upon it as a group of
clowns who pose at playing rock
music, and simply laugh at the very
mention of its name.

If one were to examine Kiss’s
attitude toward what‘ it does,» one

Just as Peter Townsend is the

be the best comedy show on the
tube this year, surpassing even the
much lauded “Saturday Night
Live, ’ ’ which follows on channel 53.

“Second City” is actually an
Americanized “Monty Python’ ’-

unlimited lunacy—but here you can ‘

understand what they’re saying.
The small cast of unknowns never
come out of character so you do not
consider their own personality in
their performance.

The premise of ‘ ‘Second City,” is
what you would ﬁnd on a typical
local television station. That means,
along with the big shows from the
main network, there’s that annoy-
ing team of local newscasters who
think they’re as famous as Reasoner
and Walters, the inevitable travel
show and the expected dialing for
dollars afternoon movie. Like
“Saturday Night,” the cast spoofs

commercials, but “Second City”,

hasn’t much of a budget and can’t
afford to switch to the different
grades of ﬁlm that add so much
credibility to “Saturday Night's”
mock advertisements.
On one of the previewed shows, a
detective spinoff satire was fea-
tured. “Baretta’s Bird” has Fred,
the cockatoo, frisking crooks and
arguing with the chief in his own
detective show. The high point had
to be Fred behind the wheel of a

battered-car. chasing. some. ganga- -

sters. And last week, in a satire on
those boring analytical public ~-\\.\
television shows, there was a World .1.

Goering -bombing a St. Louis

demoralize American baseball fans.

actually looked , like.’ something
you’d ﬁnd on public television—
particularly the scenes of Hitler and
Eva Braun romping around with a
baseball bat.

The dialing for dollars movie%\».
usually runs every other week, and 
not only does a cast member portray
Moe Green, the moronic host who
feeds the answers to his wife so
she’l1 win the prize, but they act out
the entire movie. The quality here
ﬂuctuates—“Ben-Hur” was medi-
ocre, but “Rocky” was hilarious.
Because of the cast’s anonymity,

under obviously overdone makeup.

“Second City” is fresh and

be excellent. As it is, though, it’s
still good. All the more so since

Works, Vol. II \

“Works, Volume II” is the
second album of a series by
Emerson, Lake and Palmer.

The album starts off with
traditional ELP sound-the wild
synthesizer of Keith Emerson and
the quick back-up percussion of Car’
Palmer, considered by many to be
the best drummer in rock. “Brain
Salad Surgery,” which, curiously,
did not appear on the album of the
same name, makes its first
appearance on “Works,” and is
highlighted by Emerson’s keyboard
skills.

But the next cut, “Barrelhouse
Shakedown,” takes a step back-
wards into the big band era via
ELP’s use of their 70-piece backup
orchestra featuring trumpets,
Clarinets and saxaphone.

The group sticks to this kind of
beat throughout the rest of the

I

album, which includes an adapta- ‘

tion of ragtime composer‘ Serf,
Joplin’s “Maple Leaf Rag,” and the
ELP orchestra proves itself almost
as talented as the trio itself. ‘

‘‘I Believe in Father Christmas"
features the smooth voice of Greg
Lake. It had been released as a
single, but, like “Brain Salad
Surgery,” has never appeared on
an album. “Father Christmas” is
very similar to “Lucky Man” in that
both songs feature Lake, and
neither shows off the talents of the
band.

“Close But Not Touching" is a
song that causes one to check it’s
ELP playing and Chicago. On this
track, ELP uses the fast drum to...
with a brass rhythm accompani-
ment that epitomizes Chieago’s
sound.

Emerson, Lake and Palmer,"

perhaps the most talented band in
rock today, take a step away from
rock and explore other genres of
music. “Works, Vol. ii” is a geoai
album, but may be a disappo’r'.t-
ment to the diehard ELP fan.

PHILADE-LPHIA—A chorus of
“We are the champions” rung up
from members of the Pitt wrestling
team Saturday after back-to-back
victories here. A very enthusiatic
crowd braved the snow, rain and
cold weather to see the Panthers
defeat power houses Temple and
Bucknell, 21-20 and 23-17, re-
spectively, at Temple University.

Gettysburg was scheduled to
participate in the meet but did not
because it was snowed in at
Gettysburg.

“We worked a lot the past week

‘in conditioning,” said coach Dave
Adams after the Panthers’ ﬁrst
quadrangular meet of the year.

  i»;g.iIi¢;=rni3"p:rr NEWS-—Monday", January to, 1973

  Panther Matmen Topple Temple, Befuddle Bucknell 

“Some guys were pretty darned
tired, but the conditioning paid
ott.”

Temple lost to 17th-ranked
Oklahoma by two points earlier this
year when Oklahoma was rated
13th.

“They are a good team
(Temple), and we surprised a lot of
people at Temple,” assistant coach

George Bryant said. “We feel like {

we are on top of the world.”

The Panthers opened the meet
against Bucknell, winning the 118-,
126-, 150-, 167-, and 177-pound
classes as well as the heavyweight
class. Jose Martinez, in the
126-pound class, was one of three
Panthers emerging a double

winner. Martinez defeated Larry
Means of Bucknell, 7-3, and
Temple's Steve Lawrence, 10-3. in
‘a much improved performance.

“I had no conﬁdence in myself.”
Martinez said after the meet. “I
knew I could win and it was the
coaches that gave me confidence.”

The other double winners were
E-d Bredniak in the 150-pound class
and George O’Korn with two pins
in the 177-pound division.

Bucknell coach Bob Ferraro
claimed he had a “good shot" at
beating Pitt.

“We lost to Bloomsburg, 29-’

24,” he said, “and they beat Pitt.”
Adams said Bucknell “was a
better team than we expected.

They were gunned up for us. They
did a ﬁne job.”

Against Temple, the competition
was a little tougher—the Owls have
a good team and the Panthers only
had a 15-minute rest before they
wrestled again. Temple had a brief
rest because of Gettysburg’s
absence.

Also seeing action for the first
time since an operationga year ago
was Pitt’s. Mark Stepanovich. _ With
2:27 left in the third period against
Bucknell’s Doug E-bbot, Stepanox
vich registered a pin.

“I felt good.” Stepanovich said.
“Ebbot’s a very strong wrestler.”
“I think Pitt is in much better

condition than most teams,” he
added. V

Leading in the Temple meet,
21-14, Adams decided to forfeit the
heavyweight class rather than risk

re-injury to Stepanavich.

“I wanted to wrestle, but I have a
big match coming up,” Stepano-
vich said. - ~

'Adams express pleasure at the
performance of the Panther light-
weights and freshman.

"Our freshman did a ﬁne job for
us,” he said. “Glenn Maxwell,
Jose. and Ed Bredniak looked

super. The thing that plesased me,‘
most was the ‘grittiness of ouf€'

exciting show.”

range Crushed by Cagers, 86-81

Bv BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Slat"! Writer
It was just a matter of remedial
arithmetic, as the Pitt Panthers
combined two halves of ﬁne
basketball into one major upset

’ crushing the eighth-ranked Orange

of Syracuse, 86-81, Saturday night
at the Field House.

Unlike the Panthers’ two prev-
ious last-minute losses to George
Washington and Temple, there
were no periods of indecision, no
second half scoring droughts and
no late turnovers, as the Orange
had an 11-game winning streak
snapped while Pitt upped its mark
to 7-5.

In somewhat of a surprise
maneuver, Wayne Williams shifted
to the-point guard position, sending
Pete Strickland to the bench, and
Terry Knight became the ﬁfth
starter as Tim Grgurich opted for a
taller lineup in an effort to combat
Syracuse’s height advantage.

What had been billed as the
Louie and Bouie show (featuring
Syracuse’s two talented sopho-
mores, Louis Orr and Roosevelt
Bouie) quickly became the Larry
Harris hour, as the 6-6 senior
tickled the twine for 30 points (22 in
the second half) including four
backboard rattling slams.

The Orange opened in a ,2-3
zone; Harris failed to connect on
his ﬁrst two attempts, but Knight
grabbed both misses and tallied

~Pitt’s ﬁrst two points after drawing
a foul from Bouie.

After Dale Shackleford converted
a three-point play to put Syracuse
in front, the Panthers ran off six
unanswered points to assume a 8-3
lead, and coach Jim Boeheim
decided it was time for a little chat
with his charges. ‘

The monologue had an immed-
iate effect on the Orange in general
and Shackleford in particular, as
the 6-6 junior scored 13 of the next

17 points for Syracuse, and Pitt was
down by three, 20-17 with 8:38 left
in the first half. At that point,
Shackleford had already scored 16

_ points, but would go scoreless for

the next 15 minutes. .

David Olinger, inserted into the
game as another weapon against
the Orange zone, hit two long
jumpers, the second gave the
Panthers the lead, 27-26, with 4:17
left in the half. It was a lead Pitt
would never relinquish.

Early in the second half,, the
Panthers converted three steals
into layups (one byiWilliams and
two dunks by Harris that electriﬁed
the crowd of 5,012), and Pitt held a
10-point cushion, 44-34. In the
opening 6:30 of the second half, the
Panthers outscored Syracuse 18-8
to take the largest lead of the night,
52-38.

“I think we played well enough
offensively to beat a good team, but
those three turnovers early in the
second half gave them (Pitt) a lot of
momentum,” Boeheim explained.
“You can’t make mistakes like that
and expect to win a game,
especially on the road.”

Repeatedly, the Orange would
rattle off three and four consecutive
baskets, largely through the efforts
of a full court press, but the
Panthers would always answer with
a big play to keep Syracuse at bay.

Syracuse ran off six points to cut
the bulge to eight, 52-44, but
Harris, going to the hoop like a
man possesssed, scored on a
driving dunk and was fouled by
Marty Byrnes. The ensuing free
throw put the Panthers back up by
11, 55-44.

The Orange were now in their
full court press after every hoop,
forcing several turnovers that were
converted into easy quick points.
Syracuse narrowed the gap to four,

Cowboys Are Super, 27-10  

NEW ORLE-ANS—Roger’ Stau-
bach steered the Dallas Cowboys,
steered the Dallas Cowboys
through a sea of Super Bowl
mistakes Sunday for a 27-10 victory
over the Denver Broncos to capture

‘the world championship of profes-

sional football.

Staubach threw one touchdown
pass to Butch Johnson in the third
quarter. and running back Robert
Newhouse hurled another on an
option play to Golden Richards in
the fourth as the Cowboys picked
apart the Denver secondary.

Tony Dorsett, forced out of the
game in the third period with a
twisted right knee, scored the other
Cowboys touchdown on a 3-yard
run after Dallas intercepted the
ﬁrst of four passes off Broncos

_ quarterback Craig Morton.

A Time after time, the ﬁerce
s“D°°m5dav H” ".1¢f¢"5'.°. at the

Cowboys forced vital Denver
turnover and ﬁnally, just as they
had predicted, the Dallas defend-
ers chased Denver quarterback
Morton clear out of the ball game.

Morton, a former Cowboy who
had thrown only eight interceptions
all season-lowest of any passer in
the American Football Conference-
had four aerials picked off in the
ﬁrst half alone. He ﬁnally was
lifted in the middle of a Bronco
offensive series and replaced by

.Norris Weese, who moved Denver

to its only touchdown of the game.

On successive series in the ﬁrst
period, Morton threw soft passes
that were easily picked off by
Dallas. defenders. Each time he
threw the ball wirh Cowboys
defenders on top of him.

On ﬁrst down, Staubach hit Billy

= Joe DuPree for yards for a ﬁrst

down_»at the 12. Three shots into
the line by Newhouse and Dorsett
moved it to the 3. On fourth down
and inches, Dorsett burst into the
end zone.

Now Denver started again, this
time from the 40. On second down,
Morton dropped back and found Ed
“Too Tall” Jones draped over him.

His pass was tippedtby middle
linebacker Bob Bruenig and picked
off by cornerback Aaron Kyle at the
Dallas 40.

In the game, Denver managed
only 11 ﬁrst downs and between
them, Morton and, Weese put
together only 61 yards passing
compared to the 217 that Dallas
gained throughithe air. Of that
total, Staubach accounted for 182,
completing 17 of 25 attempts.

Danny White ﬁlled in for him

For the next six minutes, the
Panthers, led by Knight and
Williams, kept the lead from
disintigrating below seven points,
but with 2:30 to play, Pitt’s dreams
of an upset were dealt a serious
blow.

With Syracuse pressing all over
the court, Williams got the ball to
Clancy with a clear lane to the
hoop. Taking advantage of the
opportunity, Clancy lowered his
head and drove to the basket,
‘dunking with a ferocity that may
have registered on the Richter
scale. knocking Bouie into the
cheap seats in the process.

The basket counted. which put

the Panthers ahead by 78-71, but ‘

Clancy was tagged with a technical
foul for hanging on the rim as well
as a charging foul, his ﬁfth of the
evening. A possibility of a
ﬁve-point play for Syracuse wasia
possibility (a technical, a one-and-
one and the ball out of bounds),
plus the fact that Pitt would be
playing the ﬁnal critical minutes
without its leading rebounder

another heartbreaking loss. I

Olinger Obviously Talented

By KADILAK

Pitt News Staff Writer

Before Saturday night's bas-
ketball game between Pitt and
eighth-ranked Syracuse at Fitzger-
ald Field House, Panther freshman
Dave Olinger seemed to be a bigger
part of the Pitt basketball team’s
future plans than its immediate
ones, since the 6-5 freshman from
Fresno, Ohio had seen only spot
duty in a few Pitt games.  ‘ .

However, against Syracuse,
which came into the contest

{_”‘>-sporting a 12-1 record and an 11-

game winning streak along with its
national ranking, Olinger was
pushed into the Panthers’ immed-
iate plans.

In a major shakeup that had
junior Wayne Williams moving to
point guard for the ﬁrst time in his
college career, and forward Larry
Harris playing on the point
defensively, coach Tim Grgurich
used sixth-man Olinger at the wing,
opposite Harris. In a reserve role,
Olinger‘ saw duty in both halves,
spelling freshman forward Sam
Clancy when he fouled out late in
the second half.

l Although the Ohioan admitted he

was nervous heading into his ﬁrst
real taste of college action, Olinger
responded in steely fashion,
unnerving the Syracuse defense
with four points and ﬁve rebounds,
which led the Panthers to their
biggest win of the season.

“Coach Grgurich told me he was
going to use me after our‘ last
” Olinger explained. “In

practice that I was going to play

I 6 against Syracuse.

“He inserted me at the wing and
moved Wayne to point guard,”
Olinger continued. “He ﬁgured I
could get some rebounds and take
the outside shots.”

Taking advantage of his 6-5
frame, Olinger did a ﬁne job
muscling his way into the trafﬁc
underneath the hoop, following up
missed shots and knocking away
balls out of the reach of Syracuse
defenders. The job was easier,
Olinger noted, because Syracuse,
known for its strong man-to-man
defense_, went to a zone for most of
the game.

“It was surprising to see them
play the zone,” Olinger said.
“They have a really strong man

-to-man defense. But we took what

they gave us. Larry and I were on
:the wings. Playing against a zone,

we both could take those long shots,
and we also were freer to follow up
the shot underneath. It sure made it
easier for Larry and me.”

Playing against the Syracuse
zone suited Olinger ﬁne. As a high
school star last year, Olinger
averaged 27 points, many of which
came on long-range shots from the
outside.

“You can take those outside shots
all day against the zone,” Olinger
explained. “You’re a lot freer to
shoot from the outside against a
zone.”

Olinger could be an even bigger
part of the Panther plans in the
games ahead, including Wednes-
day’s between Pitt and Robert
Morris at the Field House.

“Coach hasn’t told us his plans
yet.” Olinger said Sunday. “I think
he will stick with Wayne at point
guard. and I don't know whether I’ll
be playing as much as I did last
night. Ihopeldo. We’ll have to see
how things turn out in practice.”

Harris Rises to Occasion--Shoots Syracuse Out of Sky ‘

MURPHY

MARK
Pitt News Staff Writer

By

Larry Harris has done it again.
Staging his second annual
nationally-ranked team-killing,
Harris was brilliant in leading the
Panthers to 40 minutes of

domination over eighth-rated Syra-

cuse at the Field House Saturday.
Harris pumped in 30 points on 13

V of 24- shooting from the ﬁeld

t-

‘f i 

{including four electrifying slam
Hunks), shot four for four from the
foul line, grabbed three rebounds,
dished out three assists, blocked
one shot, made two steals and did
nearly everything else but make two
commencement addresses at half-
time. Again, he was brilliant.

And while Harris was not as
dramatic as last year, when his
last-second shot staggered Cincin-
nati, the taste of victory was no less
sweet for the 6-6 senior.

“We were down (after tough

losses to Temple and George
Washington) and everyone was out
there playing their hearts out,”
Harris said. ‘ ‘We ﬁgured if we were
going to lose, we might as well lose
going 110 percent.” .

Pitt won going 120 percent, and it
was Harris who spearheaded the
seemingly newfound Panther killer
instinct. - .. -

“I get extra psyched up for the
big games,” Harrissaid. “I had
nothing to prove. "I just think I

.wasn’t playing the kind of

basketball I am capable of playing.
We just went out and played some
super ball.”

When it comes to playing super
ball for the Panthers of late, both
Wayne Williams and Sam Clancy
canimove to the front of the line as
well. Clancy picked up 16 points
and swallowed 15 rebounds before
fouling out with 2:30 remaining in
the game, after a rim-bending dunk

shot on which he charged into
Orangeman Roosevelt Bouie. Give
Bouie credit for standing i.n the path
of the hard-charging Clancy. Also

give him something to stop the .

hemorrhaging.

Williams ﬁnally has made the
total transition from high school
center to college guard, and can
now be called the most complete
player coach Tim Grgurich can put
out on the ﬂoor. The former

Schenley star picked up 12 points .

and handed off eight assists, and
was a major part of the tough Pitt
defense that gave Syracuse ﬁts.
With Grgurich going with his tallest
starting lineup, Williams played the
entire 40 minutes at point guard, a
position he never had played
before. Naturally, Syracuse
pressed the Panthers. But for a few
breakdowns, the pressure wasn’t
nearly as successful as one might
have thought.

“That was the first time (at the
point guard slot),” Williams said.
“I was real worried about the press.
I didn’t even know I would start
until after practice yesterday
(Friday). But it’s fun out there.”

Fun is holding up against a great
press and not folding the way the

.—Panthers did the previous two
_ games.

What was the difference
Saturday?

“We were just more determined
to go out there and win and do
nothing else,” Williams said.
“That’s what we talked about, and
that’s the decision we came to.

“That’s the way we should be
playing all the time,” Williams
continued. “We had to prove
something to the public. We had a
couple of bad games, so we had to
go out and do it.”

Williams playing point guard
wasn’t the only surprise Grgurich

had for the 5,012 fans who showed
up at the Field House. The first man
off the bench for the Panthers was
none other than...Dave Olinger.

The seldom-used freshman
didn’t disappoint either. He notch-
ed four points and grabbed ﬁve
rebounds, and showed enough
promise to project himself into the
already crowded sixth-man posi-
tion.

There were a few other surprises,
like all ﬁve Pitt starters scoring in
double ﬁgures, Pete Strickland not
playing, and, perhaps the biggest
surprise to many fans, the Panthers
winning.

What it all means, no one is really
sure. What Grgurich has on his
hands, though, is a 7-5 team that
could very easily be 10-2. And even
a sweet victory like the one Saturday
can’t remove that from the coach’s
mind.

  O’Kom a Them in Opponents’ Sides

” BVJIMLEWIS
Pm News Staff Writer

PHILADELPHIA—“We knew
that because of injuries Pitt had to
move George O’Kom from the
158-pound weight class to 177,”
Bucknell head wrestling coach Bob
Ferraro said after his team lost,
23-17, to the Panthers at Temple
Saturday. “With our weakness in
the heavier weights, we felt that
that was our chance to win.”

But ‘instead of adding to a 14-10

on the aftemoon—the second being
a tougher 6:27 conquest of Owl
Brian Ritter in Pitt's 21-20 victory
over Temple, helping his team
sweep a two-match trip east.

“I like to think of his (Ferraro’s)

O’Korn said. “The ﬁrst guy

were doing suichia good job after

little too ,

consecutive losses to 17th-ranked
Bloomsburg (30-11) and Buffalo
(32-18), so he held intensive
workouts throughout last week to
instill much-needed aggressiveness
into his team. Bucknell (29-24 losers
to Bloomsburg) and Temple (22-20
losers to 13th-ranked Oklahoma)
weren’t pushovers, and the added

disadvantage of having to wrestle in

two consecutive matches with no
rest time were potentially danger-
ous to Pitt’s record (4-2).

“We worked an awful lot on
conditioning and endurance,”
Adams explained, “and I think it
really paid off. Sure, we had guys
who were really tired after a while,
but overall I was really impressed
with the grittiness of the match.
Aggressive-wise, the guys are
coming, but, well, I guess it’s a
matter of the coach not able to be

satisﬁed. But there has been
improvement.”
“All of us haven't been

aggressive enough." O’Kom ad-
mitted. “But we had a really good
week of practice———no one could
imagine even slightly how much
work we did. And it showed. We
beat two very good teams-—they‘re

teams. We did well, especially the

way we beat them—back-to-back.
And this week’s practice was like a
catalyst—it made things happen.”

And what happened was 12
points from O’Kom out of the
177-pound weight slot, a slot that,
like the rest of the heavier weights,
have failed to earn points in recent
matches.

“I’ll admit, the heavyweights
were hurting,” O’Korn claimed.
“But with (190-pounder Bill) Bailey
and (heavyweight Mark) Stepano-

vich back we will be the strongest

part of the team.”

Injuries to Bailey and Stepano-
vich have caused O’Korn to be
moved from the 167- to the 177- to
the 190-pound class, at times pitting
him against wrestlers whose weight
was much more than he was used to.

‘ ‘It’s tough wrestling at a heavier
weight,” O’Korn said. “The guys
get taller and have more leverage.
Then I’m not that effective. The
lighter I get the better I get.”

And, with the return of Stepano-
vich and freshman Mike Palko to the
starting lineup, O'Korn was able to
return to the accustomed 177-pound
weight division Saturday and
responded as Adams had hoped.

“O’Korn did a fantastic job,"
Adams‘ bragged. “He did what "he
was capable of doing. He 'p’iu‘t’o"ii a

demonstration of what he could
do.”

Pantherette Cagers Destroy

By MARY S. HUZINEC
Pitt News Staff Writer

Every so often, a team has to win
a “must game.” The Pantherette
basketball squad needed one of
those wins Friday night, and they
got it—-boy, did they get it.

In an awesome show of offensive
talent, the Pantherettes destroyed
William Patterson of New Jersey,
100-S6.

Every member of the Pitt team

Wanda Randoph and Debbie

halftime, and four more—Barb

Loeffler and Rita Rodriguez-

entered the two-digit column
before the game was over.

youitger players into the,ga»m,e."

Accordingito the coach, William

W|1!- Patterson in‘Must Game’

Patterson had poor transitions, and
the Pantherettes took advantage of
it. She cited Dana Elder for
changing the tempo of the game.

“Dana slowed down the game in
the second half,” Balthaser ex-
plained. “The first half was
fast-paced. ’ ’

She also commended Welsh,
Randoph and Senkowiski for
playing “consistent games.”

“Overall,” Balthaser, ‘‘I feel it
was a good team effort.”

WHATSAN NSACAREER?

ltlsdifferent thingst

o different people

Of course. all employees at the National Security
Agency have certain things in common: they are
civilian employees of the Department of Defense;
they are engaged in technical projects vital to our
nation's communications security or a foreign
intelligence production mission; and they all enjoy
the benefits that accompany Federal employment.
However. the differences between our career
opportunities are just as interesting as their
similarities. For example.. .

TO THE ELECTRONIC ENGINEER (BS/MS): An NSA
career means delving into unique projects which can
span every phase of the R&D cycle. An engineer may
design. develop, test and manage contracts on '
communications, recording, and information storage
devices and systems whose capacities and speeds
are still considered futuristic in most quarters.

  
  

TO THE COMPUTER SCIENTIST (BS/ MS): It means
applying his or her knowledge in a wide range of
sub—disciplines such as systems design, systems pro-
gramming, operating systems, computer applications
analysis, and retrieval systems.

TO THE MATHEMATICIAN (MS): A career means
defining, formulating, and solving complex communi-
cations-related problems. Statistical mathematics,
matrix algebra and combinatorial analysis are just a
few of the tools applied by the N SA mathematician.

Interested in learning more about the difference in

an NSA career? Schedule an interviewwith us through
your Student Placement Office today. If we do not
recruit on your campus, send a resume to the address
given below.

U.S. citizenship is required.

By ANGELA VAVITHES

The men’s swim meet with Ohio
State was cancelled; Saturday
because the Buckeyes got snowed in
in Columbus. It is doubtful the meet
will be rescheduled because both
teams have acquired full schedules.

Ohio State would have been the
second opponent for the Panthers
this week. Pitt traveled to Bucknell
University Tuesday and returned

with its second win of the season. P

The score was 84-29.

At that meet, the medley relay
stroke), Mike Connor (breast
stroke), Mark Schuman (butterﬂy)
and Tom McGinley (freestyle) set a
new pool record with a time of
3:37.0. The freestyle relay of Neal
Wallace, Mickey Termin, Bob
Greenwald. and Mark Schuman also
set a pool record with a time of
3:14.0.

Other pool records were set by
Jeff Trew in the 500-yard freestyle
and Mike Connor in the 200-yard
breast stroke.

Cris Mano and Scott Winkler
filled the number one and two spots

in the one-meter and three—meter,,»,,.._

r
L»

diving competition.
Trew, Termin and Greenwald
shut out Bucknell by ﬁnishing first,
second and third, respectively, in
the 200-yard freestyle. A good
performance was also turned in by
Cris Butts in the 200-yard butterﬂy.
The Panthers will swim against
Kent State at Trees Pool Thursday
at 4:30 p.m., and according to
Schuman, a junior, the meet will be
a good one. '
“We should win, but it’s not
going to be the kind of meet where
you can just get in the water and
have a good time,” Schuman said.
