BY DEANNA L. CONGILEO

The Student Government Board
(SGB), in conjunction with the
College Young Democrats (CYD)
and College Republicans (CR), has
drafted a letter urging state
legislators to vote for higher
appropriations for Pitt.

This letter, along with another to
parents emphasizingptheir respon-
sibility to pressure the legislature,

— — will be in the mail by the end of this
iaweek, according to SGB President

Barry Weisband.

CYD and CR members are
phoning western Pennsylvania
legislators asking them to comment
on the role of higher education in
Pennsylvania and to pledge votes
for higher education appropria-
tions. 1

Voters will be able to scrutinize
these responses when they are
publicized by state news media.

SGB hopes to have several
legislators speak out for higher
appropriations at a student rally

gtentatively scheduled for April 17.

According to Weisband, the rally
will be held to impress both the

administration and the legislature
with student support and to
educate the majority of Pitt
students to the reality of next fall's
tuition increase. '
Weisband said he ‘is. dismayed
with the large percentage of
students who are ignorant of the
Student Coalition ',Against Tuition.
‘Hikes’ objective and the impending
tuition hike. .
Although only a few weeks remain
until students leave ’ for the
summer, SGB can negotiate with
the administration during the
spring term to minimize a hike.

SGB has‘ tabled plans to hire a
certified public accountant to
review the budget, Weisband said.

“There is a myth about the
level-one budget,” Weisband said.
“Most people don’t realize that it is
a minutely detailed report to every

penny spent by every University *

department. Basically, it’s a check

' and balance for the departments to

compare their budget" with the

overall University budget.”
Weisband said he hopes active

negotiation between students and

  

BAR  ND

administration will begin soon-

SGBI is planning television
‘speak-out messages emphasizing
the University's need for more
money than that now pledged by
the legislature. University repre-
sentatives also ‘may appear on

during April.

Weisband said ‘he hopes‘ Pitt‘

branch campuses and the other
state universities will help pressure
the legislature.

Reset For ABC Airing  

~ BY TOM HALL

The Pittsburgh-Notre Dame
football game,ioriginally scheduled
for October 9, has been reschedul-
ed for September 11, to coincide
with the wishes of -ABC television.

ABC approached Notre Dame
ofﬁcials with their proposal for
regional telecast of the game,
which originally suggested chang-

ing the game site from Notre Dame .

Stadium in South Bend, Indiana to
either Cleveland or New York.
Notre ‘ Dame declined,
ranged alternate terms with ABC
before Pitt was contacted.

“The television network always

approaches the home-team ﬁrst,” .

Pitt Athletic Director Casimir
Myslinski ‘said.

,6 Democratic presidential candi-
“ "date Fred Harris brought his



‘price increases in weekly grocery

  

campaign to Oakland yesterday,
holding a press conference at a
Forbes Avenue supermarket.

“I came here in order to
dramatize how outrageously high
food prices are, not only in
Pittsburgh, but also across the

United States," Harris told report- - X

ers and a small group of morning
shoppers.

“The average family's grocery
bill in this country went up $126
last year, and three-quarters of the
price increase is accounted for by
the middleman,” Harris said.

He told food shoppers not to
blame the American farmer, but
rather the middleman. whose
profits increased for the third
straight year while prices skyrock-
eted during the same time.

“We've done some comparison
shopping this morning," Harris
said, holding up several grocery
items. “This loaf of bread, when
Richard Nixon took office in 1969.
costs $.25. Now it sells for $.57."

“A pound of bacon like this
package here costs $.69 in 1969,”
the presidential contender said.
“Now it costs $1.79. And a pound
of bologna cost $.59; now it’s
$1.09."

Harris said American shoppers

“It's not enough anymore just to
be against inflation,” he said.

The Democratic contender pled-
ged he will, if elected, use
presidential inﬂuence to work for
passage of the McFall Bill, that
would provide for price controls on
monopolies and for the Hart Bill
that would reorganize largecorpor-
ations along more competitive‘
lines.

Harris singled out Ralston
Purina, Del-Monte, International
Telephone and Telegraph, and
Boeing for monopolistic activity in
food production.

He said, however, his actions as
president wouldn't force large
corporations from the food indus-

MORRIS UDALL

»

BY VALERIE STRUBLE

Arizona‘ Congressman Morris
Udall predicted he will turn in a
second-place showing in next
month's Pennsylvania democratic
primary at a press conference
yesterday in the William Penn
Hotel. ‘

Udall, who has 27 pledged.
delegates, ’is currently running
fourth behind Jimmy Carter,
George Wallace and Henry Jackson
in the democratic race for the
nomination, and hopes a victory in V

next Tuesday’ Wisconsin primary '

will pave the way for support in the
upcoming New York and Pennsyl-
vania primaries. V

“Even if I get second place in
Wisconsin, I’ll get some of the
headlines Jimmy Carter’s got in
the past few weeks," Udall said.

“Publicity is mylbiggest prob-
lem,” Udall said. “in districts
where I'm known, Iwin. Ijust need
to get my name in the papers in
the East.

Udall claimed Eastern organized
labor will support him in industrial
states even though it maintains
allegiance to Hubert Humphrey,
who, anticipating a convention
deadlock, did not enter the
primaries. V

“Humphrey’s not on the ballot
and his supporters realize a
vigorous three-man race where no
one gets a clear majority is in their
own best interests. ‘

philosophically closer to Humphrey
than any of the other candidates,”
Udall said.

The Arizona congressman also is
relying on support from Pitts-
burgh’s Birch Bayh delegates, who
pledged their votes to Udall after
Bayh’s withdrawal from the race.

Udall’s campaign centers on the
issue of unemployment. If elected
president, Udall pledges top
priority to restoring full employ-
ment. V

“There are close to nine million
people out of work in this country,’ ’
Udall -said, “and ’ if Ford's
unemployment programs go right,
he’d be lucky to decrease the
number to seven million.

scArHlllr¢iioid Rally
And Petition Chancellor

BY RICH HARRY

The Student Coalition Against
Tuition Hikes (SCATH) discussed

plans for a student rally and‘

presentation of a petition to
Chancellor Wesley Posvar to
protest a pending tuition hike at its
meeting last night.

The rally, tentatively scheduled
for April 7 or 9, is designed to
inform students of the tuition
increase threat and draw student
support into SCATH efforts,
members said.

SCATH members indicated they

would meet Thursday with the
Student Government Board (SGB),
the Interfraternity Council and
PanHellenic Association to decide
upon a definite date for therally.
The petitions, planned to_ be
given to Posvar the day of the rally,
are to demonstrate student support
against the tuition increase, ac-
cording to SCATH members.
SCATH also plans to demand

Posvar present the petition to the A‘

Board of Trustees at their May
meeting. SCATH member and
SGB President Barry Weisband
indicated the timing of the
presentation to the Board would be
favorable because the Board would

tuition increase.

“The Board of Trustees can
actually see how many students are
vehemently protesting a tuition

_ increase,” Weisband said.

SCATH also plans to include

The speeches should name those

propose solutions to the hike, and
should be angry ones by students

and professors,
SCATH member Linda Nyden.

according to

SCATH member Larry Chaban
indicated speakers should repres-

ent the University.

‘‘I agree the

rally should be educational, but
hearing speakers from outside the

Media exposure, including
community as well as campus
representation, would be an
incentive for Posvar’s presence at
the rally, according to SCATH
members. '

“With media present, Posvar
will know we have_ publicity at the
rally,” commented Weisband. ‘It
would be bad image-wise if Posvar
would not be present.”

SCATH also is presently drafting
a questionaire to be circulated
among 1000 to 2000 students
informing them of SCATH and the
pending tuition hike and asking
questions concerning student resi-
dence, financial aid and employ-
ment. '

Protests Leak

Of His Report

A letter of protest has been sent
to sociology department chairman
Burkart Holzner following a story
in last Friday's Pitt News detailing
the contents of a secret 14-page
report on assistant sociology
professor Paul Nyden.

Nyden, currently battling a
departmental decision not to renew
his contract, demanded in,his letter
an apology from Holzner for the
story, which he said would damage

‘his professional reputation.

He also again ‘demanded the
release of the full report.

“Since you haye thus far refused
to release this report to me, it
would seem obvious that responsi-
ble officials of this department and
of the University have the
responsibility ‘to prevent any

portions of that report from ‘being.

leaked to anyone,” the letter
stated.

Nyden said the letter was his
ninth request for release of the
document. ,

Nyden also recently charged that
graduate students and junior
faculty members in his department
have been told to steer clear of
involvement in his case. “There is
a general atmosphere of intimida-
tion which I strongly object to,”
Nyden said.

"70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh“

Student Health Service

I I In the past few years, the Student Health Service has gone from a

 "  nurse-rim facility, ‘reminiscent of high school, to a comprehensive

.5 facility in which ‘a student's health needs, physical and mental, are

7‘ 1. - handled by doctors and paraprofessionals, as well as nurses. As can be

expected, the cost of these services has risen accordingly.
In 1972, a Blue Shield/ Blue Cross insurance program was initiated to
‘help pay"for'the increasing costs. Subscription to the program was

, voluntary, and cost $58 per‘ year. Those not subscribing to the program

could opt to pay a/ fee for“n’iedical service.

Since then, the cost of insurance has risen from $58 dollars to this
year’s total of $120. Next year, the cost may go as high‘ as $220. For
those students‘with‘no insurance coverage, the cost of anyextehded

. , treatment fromthe student health service is prohibitive.

It is impossible to attach any blame for the rising costs of medical
servi" 'ce on campus. The insurance policy, a bargain ‘at the original
price of $58, was in ‘many ways too comprehensive. The student

‘-5.5 ‘ , population’, being primarily between ages 18-22, didn't really feel a

need for any insurance ‘policy, which meant not ‘many people

" ' subscribed to the program. Those stifdents who were subscribing used

the service extensively, caﬁsing Blue Cross ‘to lose money. Therefore,

ii p ,_ the insurance company had no'choice but to raise the cost of its

policies. These things,-plus the rising costs of medical services in

' generalfhave caused’ the Student Health Service to lose nloney.

In short, students can't afford the cost of being sick. Clearly,
something must be done to provide more inexpensive care. ' To their
credit, the administration, the Student Government Board, and the

 .~ Student Health Advisory Committee realize this. oneproposal made

by Student Health Director Dr. Joarme Robinson" calls for a mandatory

i , health ‘fee from each full-time graduate and undergraduate student at

the University. This fee would be approximately‘ $16 per term, and

would cover Tmited visits "to student health’ facilities.

The

implementation of this proposal would eliminate need for the Blue

 ' Cross/Blue Shield arrangement.

This mandatory healthfee is the only proposal we’ve seen so far that i
would provide adequate health care to the Pitt community at a price

affordable to students.

However, the student body should be consulted, either by letter ‘
sampling or by direct referendum. ‘Some students, especially those

 Q /still covered under their parent’s medical insurance policies, might not
“wish to pay the mandatory fee. Many commuters fall into this
. category. '

Whatever is decided should be decided soon. It is unfortunate all of

Waseleski ls
"Copping . Out"

In “Sitting Out the Election,"
Pitt News, March 26, 1976,
Tom Waseleski makes an ironic
impression. His sad yet celebrant
alienation manifest in the “tre-
mendous feeling of power one has
in sitting out this election,”
suggest an ironic cult of active
withdrawal. In the '60s this was
called “copping out."-Fem Was-
eleski complains that a woman he
met whilepcampaigning for George
McGovern would not even re-acti-
vate her voter registration. Was-
eleski writes, “She laughed...and
said that it wouldn't make any

difference." Waseleski also com-
plains that the Democrats would

McGovern.'s organization after
Senator McGovern became the
party's nominee. Now Waseleski
indicates a promise that his vote.

It dripped in red paint from the
north wall of the Cathedral once,
and someone saw fit to inscribe it

honor. 1

I saw it once in person, and many
times, on TV. But that is past
history, and most of it is best
forgotten.

At Pitt, I've only a" seen it

1974, the weather was warm and
the air clear. Crowds were forming
for no good reason outside of the
Towers, in the Quad, and along the
Forbes food strip.

BEHIND THE LINES

Then, “plop! " Someone tossed a
water balloon from the 13th ﬂoor of
Tower B. "‘Plop, plop!” Someone
else tossed two more. “Bang!” A
ﬁrecracker. “Plop!” “Damn!” A
direct hit.

Spring Riots had begun. It
wasn’t long until the Towers patio
resembled a battlefield and the

student body had converged on the .

doing that which is most conven-
tional in American politics—not
giving a damn about the candi-

' dates. Such active withdrawal may

contain some irony, but it also
closes the door on some signiﬁcant
choice within the political arena.

Carter, Jackson, Udall and
Harris are ' Democrats who can
administer domestic affairs better
than Nixon or Ford. Waseleski says
Nixon would not supply money for
college students, but that McGov-
ern would have. What about money
for needed jobs, and national
health in 1976? What about a more
realistic amnesty? Shall we leave
these and other problems to the
Republican admistrators? Wasel-
eski is uninformed about our
potential Democratic presidential
candidates if he thinks they are
not worth supporting now. We
need Waseleski and others like him
to re-activate. And, while we may
be disappointed if we lose again, I
trust we won't be disappointed if
we win. '

Pitt wasn’t ‘the first with.
streaking, but we did it up right.
For four days it seemed like it was

The men streaked during the
day, the women (only one or two

night, conservative estimates had
no less than 500 slightly sloshed
observers lined from the Quad,

when we were “faceless" indivi-

The only places in which I have
not found any improvements is in
the classrooms and public areas
and where the students who, like
tourists. frequently ' litter with
lunches, pop cans, cups, etc. Also,
in most classroom areas which are
speciﬁcally plastered with “No

Marshall" signs. guess what is the
largest amount of debris we ﬁnd?
Right, cigarette butts!

So, in conclusion, Ibelieve the
editor of the “On Garbage" article
should direct his efforts in the
proper direction and perhaps the
ghost of a “ghetto university” will
disappear. -

Red-Baiting Won’t Help

BY BILL KALMAN

A Pitt News column entitled,
“The Chancellor Didn’t Hear,” by
Tom Waseleski carries on a
venerable tradition in American
politics—that of red-baiting.
Unionists, feminists and anti-war
activists all have been red-baited in

the past. What exactly is
red-baiting?
Whenever someone wishes to

obscure the real political differen-
ces they have with an organization

I or a movement, they red-bait it.
—f‘lHhey raise slanders, distortions,

unsubstantiated charges and the
specter of ‘red’ domination.

The column does all this quite
well. Joe McCarthy would’ve been

' is “pro-union,

proud of it.

Let's look at the column’s main
points. First, it slariders the Pitt
Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) by
implying it ‘controls’ the Student
Coalition Against Tuition Hikes
(SCATH). Of course, he doesn't
come out and say this, but through
mysterious references ‘ to “the
Militant Bookstore,” “Young So-
cialist members,” and “the Young
Socialists’ Militant Forum,” the

' message comes across.

Then, the column speaks ‘of
“SCATH types” and “SCATH
regulars.” According to" the
column, anyone who joins SCATH
pro-Nyden, has
handed out leaﬂets, has circulated
petitions, and knows how to carry a

sandwich board sign.”

Finally, Waseleski concludes
that since the communists are in
control of SCATH, Student Gov-
ernment should lead the fight
against tuition hikes.

Now let's look at reality. The Pitt
YSA does not control SCATH. .
There are at least 50 students
active in SCATH, and of these
eight are in the YSA. That's real
tight control. The column implies
YSA has‘ other interests than
building the student movement at
heart. The 15-year-history of YSA
proves this false.

And in fact, no one “controls

SCATH. All SCATH meetings are,

publicized in advance and open to
everyone. Every committee is

 

open-ended, meaning anyone can
join and help with the work. And
every meeting is conducted in a
democratic manner. In a coalition,
democracy is essential. In SCATH,
every participant gets one vote: no
individuals or organizations control
the proceedings.

Indeed, if anyone is guilty of
trying to “control” SCATH, it is
Student Government.

At the SCATH meeting of
Thursday, March 18, our elected
student leaders calmly explained to
the SCATH membership they
should take it over.

Then the Interfraternity Council
packed the meeting with 40 sorority
sisters, who obediently voted with
SGB.

Talk about dominating a meet-
ing! Members of the Interfrater-
nity Council and -PanHellenic
Association, who had never parti-
cipated in any SCATH activity,
showedup for that one vote (on

people and organizations as possi-
ble in visible mass action, to put
maximum pressure on the legisla-
ture and the administration. The
history of social movements, from
the farmworkers to the anti-racist
movement, from civil rights to the
anti-war movement, and in all
facets of the student movement,
has shown this strategy to be the
most effective.

Last year, the student govern-
ment gave us Start-Up Day. In the
face of a tuition hike, students were
told to write letters to their friendly
lawmakers.’ Students were told not
to rely on their own power, but to
depend on the benevolence of the

legislature. The result: a 14% -

 

ll

;/

-38°/otuition hike. (At least you’d

think we ‘could get it down to a
reasonable 10%.)

Those students opposed to mass
action readily accept the tuition
hike. What they are concerned
with now is how to ‘minimize’ it:
that is, responsible student leaders
should sit down with the adminis-
tration, and realistically determine
what departments to axe. This was
the gist of a student government

~letter in the March 22 Pitt News.

After all, we can’t sound too
arrogant—we’re only students.

If student government were to
take over SCATH, they would
shelve the coalition’s mass action
perspective. SCATH would be
nothing more than just another
ineffectual-student government
committee. And further, this move
would be a slap in the face to black
students (who are represented in
SCATH by the Black Action
Society) and to graduate students
(since the student government is an
undergraduate organization). And
neither group favors another
letter-writing campaign.

That is why the Pitt News,

German Course--German Style

BY KATHRYN KIMBALL

Coordinating a series of courses
around one general topicis new to
Pitt's German department this
term, but similar to the way
courses are taught in Germany,
according to visiting professor
Wolfgang Schluchter.

“There’s more of a general
tendency on the part of students
and professors in Germany to be
involved in comprehensive courses
like this one we are now teaching,”
Schluchter said.

One reason is because in German
universities there is no strict
division of departments.

Schluchter, who taught at the
University of Duesseldorf, will
move to the University of Heidel-
berg when he leaves Pitt at the end
of this term. He noted several
other differences between Ameri-
can and German universities, aside
from the issue of departmental
division. 4

“The whole structure of higher
education is different in Ger-
many,” he explained. “After the
gymnasium, all students go to the
university and strive for a master’s
degree." A .

There are no private universities
in Germany; all are public and

' financed by the state. .

‘‘There’s no problem of gettin
enrollment, no need to strive for
it,” he said. “In fact, they are noyv
overcrowded . ’ ’ ‘

The administration in German
universities is more integrated with
the rest of the school’s community.

“They perform” staff functions, ’ ’
Schluchter said. “They are not a
separate power withinjthe univer-
sity.” _ V .
Classes are .much larger in
Germany. The students also .are
older and study for four or ﬁve
They specialize from the
start because their universities are
more like U.S. graduate schools.

“The whole system of courses in
Germany is not as strict—there’s
more leeway concerning what one

9

can do,‘ Schluchter explained.

Pitt’s first attempt at linking up a
group of coordinated courses is
centered around the topic of
Wei_mar Germany. Participating
students take a core course
entitled, “Weimar Culture” team-
taught by Schluchter, whose
speciality is comparative sociology,
and German literature instructor
Martha Woodmansee. Satellite
courses related to the subject
enable students to meet distribu-
tion requirements in areas such as
ﬁne arts, sociology, philosophy and
history.

The course ‘is taught jointly so
that Schluchter can provide the
social context to the broadergaspect
of literature.

“This way, students get a frame
of reference that is necessary to
understand the literature, drama
and changes in German develop-
ment,” Schluchter explained. “No
one perspective is the whole
picture.” if ~

“We wanted to do a special
German "semester in which we
made use of the expertise and
strength of other departments,”
Woodmansee said. “We have
come to look skeptically at what
German departments do. It’s like
opening your eyes and wondering
why you're studying only one
aspect of a subject.” ,

Woodmansee would like to see
the department» expand into a
German studies center, as opposed
to a strictly literature and language
department.

“You can compare our feelings
to some extent with the concern of
scientists now,” explained John
Neubauer, chairman of the depart-
ment of Germanic languages and
literature. “They’ve moved from
the context of their various
functions in society."

“This department traditionally
taught language and literature——’
period—and no other aspects of the
country’s culture,” he continued.
“University ‘people tend to jealous-
ly guard their own departments,

not wanting others to invade. We
wanted to move out, and one way
was to involve experts in other
ﬁelds. This is the first time a
sociologist actually taught a Ger-
man course.”

Schluchter originally became
acquainted with Pitt’s sociology
department when he received an
Andrew Mellon Post-doctoral Fel-
lowship in 1971.

“We established a relationship
in research and the exchange of
ideas, and had the feeling _we
should ﬁnd a future arrangement,”
Schluchter said. ]

Schluchter is here 'between
terms in Germany.

“It’s been a good opportunity for
me to get some knowhow about the
operation of a German depart-
ment,” said Schulter, who was
born in West Germany. .“It gave
me a chance to think about what
Germany’s all about.

“It was one of ‘my interests to
improve my English,” Schluchter

. continued. “If you are not brought

up with a language, you don’t get
all of the connotations. To
understand a cultural setting, you
need an understanding of the
language." '

_ , Many people who don’t have a

, hospital staff members don’t have
«V «the time or teaching skills to
properly inform the general ‘public
1 about the early‘ warning signs of a
heart attack or venereal disease.
To remedy this situation, the
Health Education Center of Pitts-
burgh, a non-proﬁt United Way
agency, is in the process of
adopting Tel-Med, a nationwide
tape-recorded health service.
'  Tel-Med, which originated in
R San Bemardino, California, is
 designed so that anyone can dial a
special telephone number and hear
.. one of 256 tapes concerning topics
- ‘ such as pregnancy, first aid,
 - smoking and venereal disease. V
. _ V“These tapes are not a means of

are intended to disseminate gen-

currently being screened by local
doctors to assure that the material
covered in them is applicable to

"people in the Pittsburgh .area.

To use the Tel-Med system, a
caller must have a list of subject
titles, each of which are numbered
to eliminate time-consuming
searches for tapes. The operator
selects the proper tape from a
storage rack and inserts it in a
communications console. When the
tape is finished playing, it
disconnects the phone line and
signals the operator that it can be
returned to the storage rack. Each
call is then logged by the operators.

Tel-Med is now being used in 31
cities across the country. The costs
for implementing a 10-line Tel-Med
system are estimated at $25,000.
This includes the tape library,
installation and hookup fees. The
Health Education Center plans to
implement a 15-line system.

Pittsburgh’s Tel-Med system’,
which is backed by the Allegheny
County Medial Society, is barely
beyond the planning stages,
accordingto Cohen. Phone lines
have not been installed and many
volunteers are needed to man the
proposed 15-line ‘system. Volun-
will be reimbursed for
transportation and meals.

Information about the system
can be obtained by visiting the
Health Education Center at 200
Ross Street, or by calling 261-6010.

“Ever since Pitt bought these
buildings,’ they’ve been letting
them run down,” according to

Terry Piper, a resident’ of one of
Oakland’s University-owned apart-
ments.

But, according to Assistant Vice »

Chancellor for Public Affairs Jay
Roling, steps alreadyihave been
taken to renovate Pitt’s properties.

“When we first bought the
buildings, there were no leases and
no preventive maintenance,” Rol-

ing said. “We started by giving
them leases and doing some minor
repairs, but there is much more to
do.”

Piper's primary complaints cen-
ter on the lack of security, slow
repairs and poor heating.

Roling said the University is
looking into a new security system
for the Oakwood apartments, on

the corner of Sennot and Oakland
Ave., where Piper lives, and the
Franklin Complex, also on Oakland
Ave. '

Other complaints from Piper and
his neighbors concern the recent
rise in rent for most apartments,

/

without any noticeable increase in
quality. “The University has
promised this and promised that,

    

in The e terior of a University-owned apartment building at the corner

of Oakland Ave. and Sennot St.

but they give no definite commit-
ment. All they do is raise the rent.”
“They are saying now they will
do something about it, but they
said that two years ago,” he said.

The University does have defi-
nite plans on the drawing boards,
not just to repair~the apartment
complexes, but to vastly improve
them. The University is planning to
completely renovate the interiors
and exteriors, and to possibly build
a small pedestrian park in the
middle of the block bordered by
Oakland, Atwood, Sennott and
Bates.

“We want sincerely to be a good
neighbor and we are trying to show
that,” Roling explained.

He said he understood why some
tenants are upset, but hoped they
would be convinced of the
University's good intentions when
a group of tenants meet with Vice
Chancellor for Public Affairs
Bernard Kobosky and Vice Chan-
cellor for Business and Finance
Joseph Dutton on April 14. “We
have a real commitment now,” he
said. .

As for the increased rents, -
Roling maintains they are stﬂl$§.
below standard Oakland rents for 
apartments of comparable quality.
Most of the increasewill go directly
to offset inﬂated utility bills, with
the rest being used to counter
capital improvement costs, Roling
said.

. . about the confrontation

of the primitive and the experienced, the innocent without a past or a fu-
ture and the settled, continuing life of regulations, hypocrisies and unques-
tioned habits. Kaspar Hauser appeared in 1828 in the streets of Nuremberg,
after a childhood spent shackled in a dark cellar. Stories grew about him:
he was Napoleon’s——or somebody's—son. He was given shelter, taught to
speak, shown off as a freak or a pet; and some years later he was _baffingly
murdered. Truffaut's "L'Enfant Sauvage" concentrates on the process of -

learning, contrasted with the child's animal instincts for lost freedoms. Her-
zog shows Kaspar’s existence as a kind of trance, bounded at either end by

darkness; he is not a child to be instructed, but a being from somewhere
else, disquieting and unassimilable. Bruno S, who plays the part out of his
own history of_ a troubledlife in institutions, is extraordinary in his efforts
to understand and make himself understood. Kaspar has no independent
volition (at the outset, he's dressed like a dummy by his jailer, and simply
stands for hours like a scarecrow in the streets), but he has no independent
presence. After his death, the autopsy discovers physical abnormalities, and
the town, as it were cap return to its own sleep. Herzog directs with a total,
"self-willed concentration, and_a feeling for physical reality which derives
partly from the setting—a lush, tamed countryside, an overgrown garden,
solid wooden furniture. As with his "Aguirre," the film seems designed to
expand in the mind."—Pene|ope Houston, Sight and Sound.

  “Man Friday"

Friday Tells Crusoe Tole

BY M. C. PILECKI

Well, here we go again: another
boy-meets-boy movie.

This time the setting is a desert
island, and the story is a retelling

‘I , of Robinson Crusoe from Friday’s

point of view. Daniel Defoe doesn’t
deserve this. ,

The chief problem with Man
Friday 'is—if you’ll excuse the
expression—it’s just too black and

trying very hard to, portray an
Englishman, namely Crusoe, as a
puritannical fiend, thoroughly
swamped in the Protestant Ethic
and with as much humanity as an
overripe coconut. In comes Friday,
a rather worldly Richard Round-
tree, who comes from a humble
tribe that is the personification of
good, gentleness, generosity-
well, you get the picture.

Before Friday can get a chance to
say, “Peace,” Crusoe, like a

-borderline. psychotic, coldblood-

edly murders Friday’s companions,
likewise washed up ashore. Being
the understanding Christian that
he is, Crusoe refuses to let Friday
give his friends proper (in his
religion) funeral rites, and insists
they be buried in the sand, to be
washed out to the sea in no time.
From there it goes downhill.
Straight. Crusoe picksup “the
white man's burden” with some

great exaggeration, attempting to
bring “civilization” in its most
barbarous.forms to Friday.
Meanwhile,’Friday is so good and
loving and innocent and under-
standing-—and generally nauseat-
ing. '

Hyperbole is the downfall of Man
Friday. When viewed from the
other side, telling the familiar story
from a new point of view does
sound like a most interesting idea.
Bring in another culture and show
the variance between what they
each believe to be right.

Sounds interesting, until you see
what they did to the poor thing.
Instead of keeping Crusoe a fairly
intelligent, introspective man (after
all, he had a lot of time to be
introspective) eager for human
companionship in any shape, the
movie makes him a horsehair bigot,
lazy, domineering, and practically

Faced with Fade-Out
Slade Tightens LP

Nobody’s Fool, Slade
Warner Brothers Records, BS 2936

England's Slade used'to be as
subtle as a sonic boom, as a

‘disgusting as undeodorized armp-’

its on a hot, steamy summer night.
Its “skinhead-spaceage” glitter
appearance, coupled with its 110
decibel, stomping white noise
dragged everything it did into the
boring depths of overkill.

 

On their new album Nobody’s
Fool, Slade sounds like a band
going through some much needed
changes. 0

Back in the summer of 1973 they
were hyped by Cream and Circus
as the new Beatles, and as the
greatest thing since sliced bread.
They had been riding at the top of
the English rock charts for two

years, and stateside commercial
success seemed the next logical
step. Slade arrived, created a mild
stir, but has been fading rapidly for
the last two years. With their
novelty wearing thin, and two
mediocre albums Stomp Your
Hands, Clap Your Feet and In
Flame, Slade was faced with a
perplexing problem: Either come
up with a new show-biz gimmick or
some half-decent music or face
extinction. They have wise

their product.

All eleven cuts on Nobody’s Fool
are original compositions, co-writ-
ten by lead vocalist/ rhythm guitar-
ist Noddy Holder and bass player
Jim Lea. All the songs clock in at
around four minutes, and with a
few exceptions Slade is obviously

trying to stir up a new cup of

musical tea. '

a traditional celebration of the
English pub experience. Jim Lea

plays an intoxicated honkytonk

4 piano melody nicely with Hill’s
sloppy electric guitar lead, provid-
ing an excellent back-drop for
Holder’s cheery vocals.

Noddy Holder’s voice has always
been Slade’s most effective musical
weapon, and at times, their biggest
‘drawback. His leather-lunged,

~,?‘§yallsy vocals (a cross between
Robert Plant in heat, with. the
cutting raspiness of the mod Rod
Stewart) have tended to get out of
control in the past, turning into
belly-aching screams capable of
shattering glass, but unfortunaely
human eardrums too.

V This time out, he’s learned to

‘ control his loud vocal chops, and

_ although the volume is sapped,
emotion and feeling emerges. The
rest of the band has also learned
the art of restraints ‘moving into
previously-unexplored musical ar-
eas.

_ Slade tries its hand at disco-soul
 “Do the Dirty”, coming up with
~Lroyal trumps.‘ Hill’s smoldering
guitar is hidden “beneath the
hesitating funk of- the rhythm
section, surfacing when iHolder
,cooly proclaims the dancing re-
frain,” Do the Dirty...and I mean...
Nowww.” '
‘‘I’m a Talker” is a Jamaican-

h
ﬂavored reggae tune, with laid-
back calypso. guitar propelled by
deliberate percussion work (con-
gas, timbales, and cowbells) from
drummer Don Powell.

“Pack up your Troubles” is a
mixture of English folk and
southern bluegrass, complete with
a melancholy Dobro guitar, -“Let’s
Call it Quits” would be appropriate
as “Kissy-face, huggy-bear mu-
sic” at a 1950’s mid-America
sock-hop. Holder’s heart-throbbing
crooning is humourously answered
with a tearful, forlorned guitar
passage from Hill.

Although “All the World is a
Stage’V’ borrows heavily from a
theme used by the Kinks on
“Celluoid Heroes,” Slade prove to
be classy thieves. An interesting
cut that employs vocal echo
vamper distortion, classical violin, -
‘and muddy bag work, it could turn’
into an anthem of a generation. The
lyrics are trite, “All the world is a
stage...we are the players...”, but
Slade somehow turns this into an
emotionally -cutting piece.

On Nobody’s Fool Slade has
admirably abandoned the distract-
ing volume, and pretensiousness of
the past. Its move toward diversiﬁ-
cation is a nice change of pace for
hard-core Slade fans, and an
excellent introductory ‘album for
those turned off by their past
antics. -

devoid of human emotion.

The idea is to point up the
of Friday’s
non-Western culture. He has no
use for competition, does not
understand the concept of personal
property, has no sexual hangups,
and delights in exploring and
exploiting his feelings. It’s

certainly a commendable collection
of ideas, and one that would have
worked better bounced off a more

boy-meets-boy movie.

Peter Toole iird Rdtree a they appear 

realistic Crusoe than a crazy
caricature. —

There's a serious lack of subtlety
that totally destroys the credibility.
Occasional anachronisms don’t
help much either, plus a presump-
tion that the audience is familiar
with the original story. The latter
is~not very helpful to the continuity,
as the uninformed (and the movie
is aimed at a young audience) may
be left trying to ﬁgure out what is
going on.

  Panthers Land Leaper

BY STEVE SYBERT
Associate Sports Editor

Schenley High basketball star
Nathan “Sonny" Lewis has signed
a letter of intent to enter Pitt, thus
becoming coach Tim Grgurichfs

third outstanding recruit for the_

1976-77 season.

Joining signed prospects Mi-
chael Rice and David Washington,
Lewis will be counted on to help
Pitt regain a winning formula. With
Larry Harris and possibly Keith
Starr returning, the Panthers could
well be a basketball power next
season and in the near future.

 “We are thrilled to be able to

' ‘add to our program a player of

Lewis’ caliber,” Assistant Coach

Bob Hill said. “He has super

potential, and with a few minor

adjustments we feel he can

_ contribute to our program as soon
as next year."

Lewis (6-2, 165 pounds) this
season led Schenley to the PIAA
playoffs, where the Archers lost to
Farrell in the Wester semi-ﬁnals.
He will become the third. Schenley
player to enter Pitt in the last two
years, following Kelvin Smith and
Wayne Williams.

3

A'member of the Pennsylvania
All-Stars in Friday's Roundball
Classis, Lewis becomes the 11th
Schenley player to anticipate in the
prestigeous tournament.

Though Pitt was not his initial
choice, Lewis chose the University
for several reasons, one of which
was Coach Grgurich.

“I wanted to go somewhere in
North Carolina,” Lewis said, “but
things didn’t go off. My second
choice was Pitt. Tim Grgurich is a
wonderful person. I can relate to
him better than any other coach.

“I can ﬁt into any program,
anywhere, just as long as the coach
can let me prove myself. I know
Coach Grgurich will give me that
chance."

Lewis is as optimistic about the
Pitt basketball program as the
program is of him—meaning each
is looking for great things from the
other.

Lewis—“We’re going to have a
nice, big, young squad next year.
_We can be one of the top teams in
the NCAA. We’re going to be up
there.”

Hill—“He’s a super player, a
super person and a super student

.\ —

(Lewis is an honor student
Schenley). He as all the tools and
we feel he is as good as anyone in
our program. The most exciting
aspect of his game is his jumping.
He’s a phenomenal jumper.” _

Though Hill’ said this is the best
recruiting year Pitt has had in
many years, Lewis feels he can step
right in and do his part to
rejuvenate the Panther basketball
program, which sagged a bit last
season after NCAA and NIT
tournament appearances the two
previous seasons.

"‘Give me two games and I’ll be
in rhythm with anything,” Lewis
said. “I believe one man can run a
team,'but he might be off one
night. So, to me, basketball is a.
ﬁve-man game.”

 Pitt Wins First Battle, 8-1

BY JIM LEWIS

It was enough to make the
R.O.T.C. proud.

The Pitt Men’s tennis team used
military tactics Monday—lying low
before quietly surrounding, am-
bushing, and finally shelling
outclassed Grove City in the
Panthers season opener, 8-1.

According to Pitt's commander,
Head Coach George Dieffenbach,

_f‘—“\_the match was never close.

“We played very well and were
in command through much of the
match,” he said. ‘

Actually, the match didn’t
exactly follow game plan; Grove
City was ahead after the ﬁrst event,
the number-one singles. . ‘In that

match, Pit_t’s Joe Sakalik (the .

Panthers’ only casualty) strained a
ligament in his right foot. But
instead of just quitting and
forfeiting his match to Grove City’s
Mark Farrel, he hung in like a

trooper, ﬁnally losing the best-of-I

three match 7-5, 6-0.
4;“?-pI'IV'olverines led, 1-0.
"*"” But Pitt fought back.

The Panthers stormed the Grove
City‘ stronghold, sweeping the
other seven matches with amazing‘
ease.

Pitts’ Mike Habbel‘ defeated the
Wolverines’ Mike Mustro-(.6-2. 6-3_)
while brother Harry beat Mike

— Zellers (6-2, 7-5).

The

- . , . - a . . . - I

Dave Wuikin '

bombed Al Truver 6-1, 6-1, Lou
Miller fought off Bob Schlichter
6-4, 7-5, and Gary Mosso blasted.
Gary Lovelard 6-4, 6-1.

, Pitt kept the artillery going in
doubles. The number-one doubles
team of Wulken and Tom Gault

smothered Farrel and Truver (6-3, '

7-5) while Mike Habbel and Miller
trounced Zellers and Mustro in a
comeback (0-6, 6-1, 6-3). 'Harry
Habbel and Mosso stomped Love-
lard and Schlichter, 6-4, -6-2.
Slightly surprising, considering the
pre-match uncertainty as to who
would be ﬁlling in the number-
three and number-four spots on the
Pitt roster.

“We had an elimination tourna-
ment for those positions and Harry
Habbel and Wulken won (number-
three and number-four respectiv-
ely)," Dieffenbach claimed. “They
played very‘ well in those high
position.”

But even if they would have
faltered, others would have prob-
ably‘ picked up the slack.

“Miller won a close match and
Mosso performed well,” Dieffen-
bach said proudly. “Mike Habbel
(team captain) was especially hot
and.really was concentrating. He
was errorless in his overheads and
serves." '

Pitt's next assignment is Came-

gie-Mellon (tomorrow, 2 p.m. at

the Trees Hall courts), a" solid,
veteran outﬁt which somehow
doesn’t seem to strike fear into
Dieffenbach’s heart. V
“If we play our tennis and don't
suffer any more injuries, we’ll do
well,” the ﬁrst-year coach said.
“We’ve beaten them badly in the
past two or three years.”
. And if the Panthers’ opener is
any indication of their ability, an
about-face is not likely tomorrow.

Undefeated Indiana      
- Undisputedly No.‘1-    

BY TOM HALL
Sports Editor

As the Michigan Wolverines
entered the locker room at halftime
with a six-point lead over the
Indiana, Hoosiers in Monday
night's NCAA ﬁnal, no one in the
17,000 plus crowd at the Spectrum
in Philadelphia could have imagin-
ed that the Hoosiers would come
out in the second half and outscore
their opponents by 24 points.

But they did, leaving no doubt as
to their undisputed claim to the
national title, as they pounded
Michigan 86-68. '

Indiana center Kent Benson,
who poured in 25 points against his
Big-10 rivals in the last game of the
1976 collegiate basketball season,
was named the tournament's Most
Valuable Player. Scott May,
Indiana’s all-America forward, led
all scorers with 26 points. Guard
Ricky Green was top man for
Michigan with 18.

The game started off with the
two teams see-sawing back and
forth into the lead. The Wolverine
fast-break, their most potent
weapon against the bigger, more

.. powerful Hoosiers, was working to

perfection as they vaulted into a
surprising 18-10 lead.‘

“And what
were they
going to do
  ' with the
Holy Grail

   

Indiana immediately regained its
composure, and, working the ball“ "
into the middle to Benson and May,
scored nine unanswered points to“
regain the lead," 19-18. A .-2;

It was a tight battle throughout  ' ‘
the first half, with the Michigan .
defense rising to the occasion . V  7
against the touted Indiana offense. ' '
The Hoosiers seemed a bit off
balance, with the exception of the _ .
play of Benson, and the Wolverines V 2
had their moments of glory. V

The second half started off just
as close, with Indiana narrowing
the gap slowly, and ﬁnally tying the
game up at the 9:55 mark.

From that point on the Wolver-
ines were virtually helpless in their  
efforts to match the brute strength a 
of the Hoosiers. Michigan center
Phil Hubbard fouled 4‘ out a few
minutes later, followed by team- __ ./
mate Wayman Britt, who played an I Q
outstanding defensive game ‘A 
against May. I ; . -_

With the Wolverine strength all 

 

' but gone, Indiana pulled away by '

leaps and bounds before Indiana
coach Bobby Knight let up, and" .
removed his starters from the floor L 
with less than two minutes left in ' ' '
the game. ”

Weather permitting, Pitt’s base-
ball season will open today at 2:30
p.m.'with a squad that. lost eight
seniors from last year. Head Coach
Bobby Lewis, beginning his 22nd
season as coach, said he’,doesn’t
need the weather as another of his
problems.

“They’re always joking that the
farmers write to me and ask when
the’Pitt baseball season starts so ’
they know when to plant their
seeds,” Lewis said.

Lewis expects the Panthers, a
young team, to turn in a successful
campaign" to follow last season's
10-4 card. It’s only a matter of Pitt
jelling a lot of individual talent," he
said.

“We’re looking forward to a very
exciting year,” Lewis said. “We’ve
got a lot of new faces and we’re
really looking forward to playing
ball. We need to get into the actual
games.”

The pitching staff is Lewis’

biggest question mark. "With only
one experienced veteran returning ‘

to his seven or eight-man staff,
Lewis feels’ his pitchers will be
“adequate, though not overpower-

Senior Don Kennedy, the lone
veteran, posted a 3-1 record and a
3.46 earned-run average (ERA) in
26 innings last season. He and Les
Qualk, a junior, will carry most of
the pitching burden. Qualk pitched
three and two-thirds innings last
year, winning one game, with a
2.25 ERA.

The catching spot will go to
junior team captain Val Bianco,
who was second on the Pitt
squad—Marc is a freshman pit-
cher, while Mike is a junior
outﬁelder who played seven games
last season.

Senior Mike Miller is set for duty
at first base,‘ with sophomore Dan.
Smodic at second and either Bernie
Rossman or Allen .Witkowski at
third. Rossman, a senior letterman,
brings back a .353 batting average
to lead the Pitt attack. Witkowski is
a junior college transfer who will
battle Rossman for the job.

Lewis said he has an outstanding
shortstop prospect in freshman
Dan Skinner, whose only otherrival
for the position is junior Kurt
Leitholf. ‘ ‘

“Skinner is cut from the same
mold as Joe Groetsch (who
graduated last year),” Lewis said.

ATTICA GRAND
JURY RELEASED

WARSAW, N.Y. (AP)——Two
special grand juries that had been
investigating the bloody 1971
Attica prison revolt were discharg-
ed yesterday with one subject to
recall if necessary.

Justice Carman F. Ball of state
Supreme Court discharged the two
juries on the motion of Alfred J.
Scotti, the special state prosecutor
of Attica rebellion cases.

A jury convened in Nvember
1971, two months after the revolt,
handed Ball a thick report which
the judge said he would review to
determine if it should be ﬁled.

Ball told the jurors he was
discharging them subject to recall
but said he doubted that would be
necessary.

POPULATION HITS 4 BILLION

CHICAGO (AP)——The world’s
population passed the four billion
mark on Sunday. according to the
population clock at the Museum of
Science and Industry.

‘flt just keeps ticking away and
sooner or later it was bound to hit a
mark such as this," said Bruce
Mitchell, assistant to the president
of the museum.

The four billion mark was passed
around midnight, a museum
spokesman said, and had reached
4,000,102,000 by midmorning Sun-
day.

BLUE LAWS IGNORED

BRADFORD, Pa. (AP)—Three
supermarkets opened here Sunday
for the first time in a year after
authorities said they would no
longer prosecute businesses for
Sunday sales.

McKean County Dist. Atty.
James K. Angel] said earlier that
violations of Pennsylvania's Blue
Laws would no longer be cited
because he couldn't see prosecut-
ing stores for “what is, in effect, a
service to the public.”

 

CHILD ABUSE LINE OPENS

HARRISBURG (AP)—Te1e-
phones are finally ringing at the
state's child abuse hotline, ending
make work projects for staffers who
were hired nine months ago.

The program for receiving
reports of child abuse was held up
by bureaucratic delays, a frequent
occurrence in state government.
The unusual situation here was the
hiring of staff members long before
the project began and then creating
work for them.

Since last June, when a dozen of
the 24 employes were hired, the
workers have been compiling
directories of social service agen-
cies and talking to county officials
about child abuse.

“NUCLEAR LUNACY’l’

SOUTH KINGSTON, R.I. (AP)-
Peace activist Philip Berrigan says
a campaign of civil disobedience
should be directed against the U.S.
niilitary's “Nuclear lunacy."

In a speech at the University of
Rhode Island, Berrigan urged
students to step up efforts aimed at
pressuring nuclear arms control.

“A national debate on nuclear
lunacy has to be held," the former
Roman Catholic priest said Monday
night. “As long as there is no
protest to the bomb, we have
committed ourselves to the bomb.”

Earlier this year, Berrigan
served 30 days in jail for digging a
mock grave on the White House
lawn. After his release, he dug
another grave at the Pentagon and’.
was arrested again.

  The Nyden Case

  A Speak-Out on

Academic Freedom at Piﬂ  

The Pitt Sociology Department has FIRED DR. PAUL NYDEN, a young professor who has spoken out
against racism, male supremacy, and militarism on _campus. Dr. Nyden teaches many courses on labor
sociology, minorities, and social problems. His Ph.D. thesis, which received distinction at Columbia Univer-
sity, deals with Miners for Democracy, the rank-and-file group in the United Mine Workers of America.

Why does Dr-. Nyden argue that he has been FIRED FOR POLITICAL REASONS?
Why have so many young and progressive professors been FIRED this year?

. Why do Dean Rosenberg and the Sociology Depa_rtment REFUSE TO RELEASETHE SECRET REPORT
which details the exact reasons for Dr. Nyden’s firing?

Why has the FBI ATTEMPTED TO RECRUIT. STUDENTS in Dr. Nyden’s classes to infiltrate the Student
Committee to Defend Dr. Nyden? ’
