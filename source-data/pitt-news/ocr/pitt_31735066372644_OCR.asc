Appropriation Increase P

{By SETH LUBOVE

Gov. Dick‘ Thronburgh pro-
posed yesterday that Pitt receive
$78,220_.000 in appropriations for
fiscal year 1983, a 6 percent increase
over what Pitt received in state sup»
port for this year.

Pitt had asked the state for $85.5
million in state support, or a 14.5
percent increase over what the uni-
versity had received for the current
fiscal year.

“Given the severely ditticult fis-
cal situation in Washington and in

other states, a 6 percent increase
actually reflects a relatively high
priority,” Pitt Chancellor Wesley
Posvar said in a statement.
“Although it will not fully meet
anticipated costs. it demonstrates
Gov. Thornburgh's appreciation

that higher education builds
human capital for the common-
wealth. -

The appropriations were part of
the governor’s proposed $13 bil-
lion state budget that includes no
tax increases and calls for a 3.1 per-

Tuition Hike At
Trustees Meeting

‘By FREDERICK BEERS

Despite a 6 percent increase in
state appropriations, Pitt will be
forced to raise tuition for an eighth
consecutive year, Chancellor Wes-
ley Posvar announced at yester-
day’s board of trustees meeting.

Posvar said that in light of
serious financial difficulties other
states are experiencing, the appro-
priation “reflects a relatively high
priority to higher education.” ‘

The proposed appropriation to
Pitt is $78,220,000, an increase of
$4,264,000 over that of the current
year. .

Posvar told the board that next
year’s appropriation will include
both an increase in and restructur-

ing of support for medical educa-
tion and an increase in direct
student aid.

The board approved resolutions
to begin action on the financing of
a new home for the Graduate.
School of Business and the Schen-
ley Hall renovation.

Jack Freeman, senior vice clian-
cellor for administration, reported
that the administration has been
looking at architectural drawings
for the proposed GSB, and in order
to meet the needs of the school,
refinements in the construction
will have to be made, including a
switch to a glass wall system
instead of a masonry system and
the incorporation of more space
into the drawings.

Freeman ‘said the revisions

 

cent increase in spending for the
next fiscal year beginning July 1,
1982.

The budget the governor pre-
sented to the state legislature is
only a recommendation, and still
must be approved by both houses
of the General Assembly. Hearings
are expected to begin soon, while
Pitt will bring its plea for funding
before the legislature sometime
this spring.

The governor recommended that

university, receive $143,481,000 in
state support for the coming year.

Pitt has already stated that tui-
tion would be hiked 5 percent
beginning next September.
Because the 5 percent increase was
based on the full amount of appro-
priations Pitt had asked for, it is
not yet known how much higher
tuition will actually be increased
when the board of trustees
approves Pitt’s FY 83 budget ,t_hi‘s

the university has a “firm

Council Told

Social Security ‘

Records Lost

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

The federal government has lost
all of Pitt’s Social Security records
between’the years of 1978 and 1979,
Chancellor Wesley Posvar an-
nounced at Monday’s Senate
Council meeting.

Posvar said the records were lost
somewhere between the Internal

_Revenue Service and the Social

Security Administration. He said
he has received “oral reassurance”
from the Social Security Adminis-
tration that the problem was being
porrected.
Daehnick, chairman of the Senate
Budget Policies Committee, the
“FICA accounts of many Pitt
employees currently show no cred-
its since l978.” Daehnick said new
records were being made by the
Social Security Administration.
Daehnick said the council was
informed of the problem last Sep-
tember, but they did not announce
it to the faculty and staff because
they did not want to worry those
employees involved. The council
adopted resolutions Monday so
employees will be informed of the
problem and the steps being taken.

“PIowshares Eight” Member

By PEGGY FERRI

In the face of the escalating arms
build-up, new developments in the
production of nerve gas and
government announcements of its
intentions to bargain _ for peace
from a position of strength, it has
become apparent to concerned citi-
zens like John Schuchardt that
human life is precariously bal-
anced. Schuchardt, an ex-marine, a
lawyer and a member of the Plow-
shares Eight, expressed his concern
through an act of civil disobe-
dience, and explained’ his“ reason-
ing at a meeting of the Arms Race
Study Group yesterday.

Schuchardt and the other
members of the ‘Plowshares Eight
entered that General Electric plant
in King at Prussia, Pa., on Sept. 9,
1980, carrying hammers, and
smashed two Mark I2 nose cones
used to carry hydrogen bombs on
Minuteman III missiles. They
called themselves the “Plowshares
Eight,” alluding to the Biblical act
of beating swords into plowshares.

"We are standing on the brink of
annihilation,” Schuchardt told the
group. “We live under the bomb,
and just look at us——we go out to
the movies. We talk about ten years
from now and its just a fantasy.”

He said that we, as human
beings, haveto look at our condi-
tion and then we have to look to
where we are moving. The under-
standing of this interconnectedness
of life is the starting point.

“We have to think ofourselves as
members of the human family; we
cannot think ofourselves as Ameri-

he explained. “So what was our

couldn't pretend that we didn’t see

In addition to pointing out the

Schuchardt said that Pitt had pre-

Pitt’s work began in 1954,
according to the book. “From 1961

 According to the resolutions

adopted, a statement of what hap-
pened will be publicized in tomor-
row's University Times, and a sim-
ilar statement will accompany
employees’ February paychecks.
That statement will also include
“instructions for steps that individ-
uals themselves can take to update
the status of their Social Security
accounts,” the resolution stated.
“It’s important that people be

informed that there‘s a problem," ,  _

Daehnick said. “They should have
been informed when the problem
was first known six months ago."

Daehnick assured the council
that the university is doing every-
thing it can to make sure

f-)employees are informed of the
._ _.s

ituation.

Posvar said “no one need fear”
that they will not receive the eligi-
bility to which they are entitled. He
said the Social Security Adminis-

- tration drafted a letter to send to the

university reassuring it that the"

problem had been handled. Posvar
said the letter was read to him over
the telephone but that he has yet to
receive the letter.

Both Posvar and Daehnick said
that no real problems should arise
for Pitt's employees if they have
their W-2 forms for the years
involved. - .

jack Freeman, senior vice-
chancellor for administration, said
‘_‘<.:ach faculty and‘ staff member

Also at Monda‘y’s meeting, Pos-
var defended the university in the
alleged actions that contributed to
former football coach Jackie Sher-
rill’s decision to take a position
with Texas A8cM University. Pos-
var called the reporting done in
local newspapers “erroneous,” and
said the university is “even better
off than we were before" witlrnew
head coach Foge Fagio.

Posvar said that Ed Bozick,
assisiant chancellor, was not at
fault in the situation and. the
reports that he would not allow

“You are truly the eyes and ears
of this University," he said, “and
the truth will travel like light."

Schuchardt addressed the belief
that acts of civil disobedience
encourage others, until there are no
tnore laws.

“We stop at stop lights, too, we
w‘:t'tit laws—let's not replace laws
with simple coercion." he said. He

added that each person must
decide, and follow his own
conscience.

“This world is inhabited by the
survivors of wars and concentra-
tion camps,” he explained. adding
that the world is in an on-going
war where secrecy is prevalent and
government feels authorized to lie.

“I am asking you to face death,"
he said. “The reality of it is over-

whelming, but one of the steps I,

mentioned is that we have to recog-
nize our position, and understand
that We are all interconnected and
part of the human race.”

L. 1

Public Needs
Versus Rights

The Dean of Students at DePaul University took a
rather straightforward approach when that school’s
campus newspaper published a story on a campus
rape against his request: He had the campus police
confiscate the newspaper and forbid its distribution.
The next day, however, the president of the private
Catholic university overruled the dean, and allowed
the paper to be distributed——with the rape story.

Although we are against on principle the confis-
cation of any newspaper or publication, the DePaul

- dean was probably acting in what he felt was the
most appropriate manner. And although we are con-
fident the same thing probably couldn't happen at
Pitt, we are also confident that there are at least a few
persons on this campus who might be inclined to
imitate the DePaul dean’s action after some past Pitt
News stories about campus rapes and assaults.

Our reasons fo_r printing the stories, however, ‘can,
probably be summed up by the justification given by
the DePaul editor for printing the story in his

newspaper: ‘

“If something like this is happening, the students
need to know about it,” said DePaulia editor-in-

chief Vince Kellen.

Kellen’s choice of words in this case is important
to ‘recognize: The students, he said, have a need to
know—about the rape. We feel the same way, and
place just as much importance upon the campus-
community’s need, rather than right to know about

violent crime.

Nobody has a right to know when another person
has been involved in a violent incident, and it is
primarily for this reason that the identity of the
victim is kept in strict confidence when these stories
are published. But there is a definite need for stu-
dents, particularly resident students who must rely
on their own preventive measures and campus
police for protection, to know where the highest
incidence of crime occurs. -

It stands to reason that if students know where an
assault occurred, they will be a little more careful

.. when approaching that particular area in the future:
And as many police chiefs have emphasized, includ-
ing Pitt’s own director of public safety, William

' Tucker, the effectiveness of law enforcement and

protection is

involvement.

increased

through community

It is for thisreason that we are astonished when we
hear reports that—the.reputations of the university
and the, campus police are in some way compro-
,mised‘by stories The Pitt News has published about
campus rapes or assaults. We would be led to believe
that anyone who makes such a claim is, in essence,
saying that the university’s reputation is more
important than the individual’s right to safety.

The campus police will never be able to prevent

rapes and assaults on our large, urban campus. The ,

police can investigate, follow-up and suggest pre-
ventive measures, but the bulk of the responsibility
for preventing these crimes falls upon the students
and the members of the university community.

As part of this responsibility, we hopethat The
Pitt News’ stories detailing the crimes are one more
step toward prevention, until our students can be
reasonably assuredlthat Pitt’s campus is not a place

to fear.

Dear Editor:

If it is any comfort to ‘Alexander
Webster, his counterparts in Iran'—
i.e., Iranians with no understand- A
ing of Christianity and who accept
without question the popular press
stereotype of Jerry Falwell—would
be outraged by my comparison of
Falwell with Khomeini as he is
(although hopefully, unlike Mr.
Webster, they would note my men-"
tion of areas of noncomparability).
The purpose in my terrible “ponti-
ficating” and “irresponsibility,” as
Webster sees it, was to deal with a
serious question. The Iranian revo-
lution represents one of the world’s
most significant social movements.

Is‘ that movement universal in its ’

implications’ or the peculiar mani-
festation of Iranian society at this
moment in time? I believe it has
universal implications, and I do
not apologize for daring to express
this opinion. .
Knowing full well that Mr. Alex-
ander, with his own interpretation
of Christian charity, willjudge this

too as irresponsible pontificating,
let me offer him this riddle. Who
and what does the following
remind you of, Mr. Alexander?
The core supporters of Kho-
meini are individuals who, until
the revolution, were far-removed
from the center of Iranian political
power. They are God-fearing,

“It is true that Falwell and
the Moral Ma/ority have not
executed anyone. But
neither had Khomeini before
he came to power.” ‘

deeply devout and respectful of the
teachings of their religious leaders.
They are angry and resentfulat the
treatment they received in the past
from the Iranian establishment——a
treatment they see as arrogantly

/ contemptuous, disdainlul and de-

nying them full dignity as human
beings. They agree with their reli-

gious leaders that this establish-
ment manifests clear signs of moral
decadence and corruption. They
see secular liberal intellectuals in
particular as having rejected tradi-
tional moral values and having
been attracted to alien philoso-
phies and ways of life.

Their leader is a man who under-
stands their anger and their aspira-
tions and articulates them with
brilliant effectiveness. He is a man
of_ moral certainty, utterly con-
vinced of the truth of his teachings
and of his closeness to the essence
of God’s message as revealed. With
this certainty of view, he is able to
describe those whom he disagrees
in absolute terms--as, for example,
“satanic forces.” ‘

It is true, as Mr. Webster says,
that Falwell and the Moral Major-
ity have not executed anyone. But
neither had Khomeini before he
came into power.

Unions/Are All Right - Except at Pitt I

(Editor’s note: The following is a
reprint of a letter sent to Dr.
Richard S. Thorn, president of the
Pitt Chapter of the AA UP)

Dear Mr. Thorn:
In response to your undated but

recent letter to the Pitt Chapter of .

the American-Association of Uni-
versity Professors (AAUP) I remain
opposed to theestablishment of a
collective bargaining agent to
represent alleged faculty interests
in dealing with the university
administration. I continue to take
this stand despite my strong sup-
port of collective bargaining in
commerce, industry, agriculture
and in primary and secondary edu-
cation for the following reasons
among others.

First, employment in worthy
colleges and universities is and
should be selective in intent and
practice—selective on behalf of
excellence in research and teaching
and, -when it is the lot of the

scholar-teacher, administration.

Excellence requires selectivity in
appointments, promotions, pay
scales and, as necessary, working
conditions. The thrust of unioniza-
tion tends to lie in the opposite
direction and appropriately so in
commerce and industry and at
some levels of the public service.
My convictioiroii this s(‘r>iv: brings
to mind the uiiiversity'.s and the
nation's cciininitiiieiitot affirma-
tive action. I find ’nothing incon-
sistent in being for affirmative
action and against collective bai-
gaining for rcasoiis I could elabo-
rate in some detail.

Second. I deny there is ‘an adver-
sary relationship betwecii teaching
and research on the one hand and"

university administration on the
other hand. University administra-
tors should be and are at Pitt per-
sons who have earned their
credentials as scholars in one way

or another. While I agree that “the ~

work of the university is too impor-
tant to be left solely in the hands of
professional administrators,” I
deny the implication in the sen-
tence I quote from your letter. I
have no intention of asking a Unit-
ed Faculty Organization compris-
ing the AAUP Chapter and the
PPU to represent my interests to
my colleagues who happen to serve
as dean, provost or chancellor. I
feel quite capable of representing
my own interests in direct com-
munication with these men and
women. When I feel there is injus-
tice or error, let’s say in the matters
of pay scales or honorary degrees, I
am fully prepared to deal collec-

tively through our system-—or an
improved system—-of faculty gov-
ernance. From personal experience
I find the administration respon-
sive to considered criticism.

{i

Who Doesrhis Remind You 

Since you ask for the support

all AAUP members, it is onlyfair
that I reiterate publicly my opposi-
tion to collective bargaining. My
“support” will be to campaign
against the representation of
faculty interests by a collective bar-
gaining agent. If I fail, I shall
resign from the United Faculty
Organization‘ and the AAUP
Chapter at Pitt while remaining a
member of the national AAUP.

Weinsc/1enker'Photo

 

How am I going to get a job?
Where do I start? These are
important questions for Pitt
seniors who are looking for
jobs. A

To help them with this pro-

located in 219Schenley Hall, or

ment_agencies. .
O’Brien Associates, located
in the Fulton Building down-
town, is a state-licensed, one-
man employment agency that
has existed since 1966. It spe-
. cializes in entry level, non-
technical career opportunities
for college graduates.
“There’s not much competi-
tion with other agencies in the

Pittsburgh area that specialize
in college graduates,"-’
explained agency manager
Dick O’Brien, -.

The company follows this
type of process. First, they talk
to employers who want to
advertise a job opening.

Secondly, they obtain informa-
tion about job requirements.
Next, O’Brien Associates puts
an advertisement in the Sun-
day edition of The Pittsburgh
Pia. Finally, people interested
in that job contact the agency
for an appointment.

- “Sometimes, I get 400 phone
calls off of one advertisement
and lcan only place six people,”
explained O’Brien.

“When ‘applicants contact
the agency, I make a determi-

cess, students can use the Uni- ’ ‘
versity Placement Service_,

one of‘ Pittsb'urgh’s %employ- .-

i_fee unless the

nation right there if the person

is an extrovert, outgoing and

can handle themselves on the
phone,” O’Brien said. “lcan tell

if they are qualified enough for

an interview just by talking to
them.”

Also, the agency requires
that all candidates submit a
resume for evaluation.

‘‘I go through the resumes
and lcall the exceptional peo-
ple,” O’Brien continued.

After these steps, the agency
interviews the applicantbefore
he or ‘she is sent to a company
interview.

“We want to send the best
candidates for that specific
job,” O’Brien explained.

The final step is‘ the inter-
view between the applicant
and the employer.

O’Brien Associates has no
job -seeker-
accepts a position. The fee then
equals one percent per thou-
sand of the person’s first year
gross earnings. For instance, if
a person makes $12,000 in the

first year, O’Brien Associates"

collects 12 percent of that
amount.

The other job-seeking aid
open to future Pitt graduates is
the University Placement Ser-
vice. Unlikeemploymentagen-
cies,' the Placement Service
does not charge a fee when a
student is placed. A

In discussing fees,Joyce Lee,
placement -counselor at Pitt,

had this to say about employ-
ment agencies: “They are
profit-making organizations
that make money by placing
people in jobs. All they do is
solicit jobs.” _

Lee advises students to make
contacts on their own and
“investigate what is out there
rather than paying someone to
do it.” -

“We’ve got a good staff that
is committed and interested to

‘take -the time to serve the

future graduate," Lee said.

Two Pitt students offered
their own opinions on this
issue.

“Students can’t afford to pay
a fee right after they finally
land a job. They have loans and
other things to pay off at the
same time,” said Chuck Rusba-
san, a senior working with
computers at Mellon Bank.

“The Placement Service
gives you an opportunity to
interview with most of the
major corporations in a few
months in the same place.-You
couldn’t do‘ this with an
employment agency,” said
Steve Rossi, an industrialengi-
neer senior who got a job at
Westinghouse Corporation
through‘ the Placement
Service.

Whether a’ student chooses
to register with an employ-
ment agency or with the Uni-
versity Placement Service, Pitt
seniors should know » the
alternatives. F

I ‘

Part II  

“The job market is not highly
active,” said Robert Hopkins, direc-
tor of the University Placement Ser-
vice. “Companies are recruiting
cautiously. Students have to be
more aggressive in order to locate
and obtain jobs.”

Students are learning that they
must not only be more aggressive
but also qualified. Many companies
are looking only for students with
work experience.

What work options are open to
students?

Valuable work experience can be
obtained through part-time,
summer and work/study jobs. The
university can help students get‘
these positions.

PART-TiME AND SUM-
MER EMPLOYMENT
OFFICE T

For some students, summer is a
time to relax and unwind from aca-
demic tensions, but for others, it is a
time to earn a supplemental income
and hopefully, valuable work
experience. ‘ i V

A summer job doesn’t have to be
a chore. It can be a time for career
development and a chance to meet
valuable contacts in the job market.

Students interested in obtaining
summer or part-time jobs should

_ register with the Summer and Part-,

time Employment office, located in
224 Schenley Hall. There are jobs
available for both technical and non-
technical students, which provide
not only a supplemental income but
also references for a future
employer.

“We receive notices of part-time
and summer jobs, temporary posi-
tions and casual labor jobs from the
university and offcampus busi-
nesses,” Hopkins said. “Jobs range
from washing storm windows to

information on careers;

positions requiring knowledge of the
computer field.”

The university realized that stu-
dents could do the on-campus jobs
that were previously given to people
outside of Pitt, therefore, many jobs
available to students are affiliatvﬁﬁ
with the university, according to
Hopkins. “We try to identify jobs
appropriate for students and then fill
these positions with students look-
ing for work,” said Hopkins. “All job
positions in the university available
to students (excluding the work-
study program) are brought to us,”
said Hopkins.

According to Hopkins, the
Summer and Part-time Employment
Office accepts a job offer from the
university or off-campus business
and posts the position on the bul-
letin board (located on the second
floor of Schenley Hall). After inter-
viewing with -a career counselor, a
student reviews the bulletin board

and gives the staff in the office tf‘>§f. ’

number of the job offer that appéa
to him. The office staff then pre-
pares a referral for the student, and
an interview with the prospective
employer is set up.

Due, to workstudy program and
financial aid reductions, more stu-
dents come to the Part-time and
Summer Employment Office look-
ing for jobs, Hopkins said.

“For some students, the income
from these jobs becomes an impor-
tant aid, letting them stay in school,”
said Hopkins.

The staff , at the Part-time and
Summer Employment Office »
doesn’t just sit and wait for compan-
ies to contact them about summer

and part-time-jobs. They con‘ Gt .

recruiters to find out’ if they ‘iii

Hopkins. Part-time and Summer

. WORK/ STUDY PRO-

I

GRAM -

“I was very pleased
with my work-study job that I had,”
remarks Gail Burcin, a senior nurs-
ing student, “The extra ‘spending
money came in handy, and I worked
in a very relaxed atmosphere.”

The work/study program helps
students seeking part-time employ-

ment based on the student’s finan- '

cial need. .

A student must be at least part-
time, keep his grades in the satisfac-
tory range, be a citizen or

‘permanent resident of the United

States and be able to demonstrate
financial aid through information
submitted on. the Financial Aid
Form (FAF).

If a student is awarded work-
/ study, he goes to the office of
Admissions and Student Aid
located on the third floor of Bruce
Hall. From there, the student sub-
mits a properly completed College
Work/Study Program (CWSP)
employment form, and then “the
student looks through the Student
Employment Directory comprised
of jobs sent to the office from both
on-and off-campus nonprofit agen-
cies,” explains Kate Miller, a work-
study processer. -

It is then the student’s responsibil-
ity to arrange an interview with the
prospective employer. The work-
/ study program is not a placement
service. It supplies job opportuni-
ties, but the student makes his own
job selection. '

According to Miller, it is helpful
for both student and employer if the
student arranges his class schedule

with large time slots during working .

hours:

Work/study is a part-time
employment program in which stu-
dents 'can work a maximum of,20
hours a week during the academic,
year and 40 hours a week during the

summer if their ﬁnancial awards can 
cover the final gross pay. Students ’
are not paid for lun5h hours, holi-

days or timeoff.
“The work/study job I had was
very ﬂexible with hours,” adds Gail,

“and they -understood the plight of -‘

the student.” .

Wages are distributed on the last
University working day of each
month according to the time
records kept by the supervisor and
student. Salaries are funded by the
federal government to a maxium of

‘80 percent and by’ the College

Work/Study Program to a maxi-
mum of 20 percent. Earnings are the
student’s personal money and do
not have to go towards tuition.

Students, expected to follow the
same rules and standards set up in
any job, are responsible to their
supervisor for punctuality and
efficiency. ' L

To apply for the Work/ Study pro-
gram you must:

1) Fill out a Financial Aid Form.

2) Submit a 1040 form. Yours if
you’re independent or your parents
if you’re not.

3) Fill out an application with the
University. ‘

The deadlines are April 1 for the
Fall/Winter terms and March 1 for
the _ Spring/ Summer. For more
information call 624-1655 or go to
the third ﬂoor of Bruce Hall. '

TEMPORARY 1 HELP

SERVICE

Temporary help services such as
Kelly Services and Manpower are
another alternative for students
looking for job experience. These
services give students the opportun-
ity to observe a wide range of career
options and to make valuable con;
tacts within businesses.

“I registered with Kelly Services
this past summer and was given

almost two months full time work,”
said Joann, a Pitt senior. “My jobs
ranged from being an accounting
clerk to giving out free samples of
food in a grocery store. I learned so

‘much -about how. different busi-

nesses are run.”

Temporary help employees have
ﬂexible schedules that give them
freedom most working people don’t
have.

“I moved from one assignment to

another,” Joann said. “My assign-

ments lasted as long as the business

, needed my help.”

There is no charge for applying

because Kelly Services and Man-—

power a.re not employment

agencies.

TIPS FOR SUMMER
JOB HUNTERS

1) Start looking now for summer
jobs; the sooner, the better.

Weinschenker Photo

2) Ask neighbors, relatives and I

friends for job leads.
3) Don’t be afraid toapproach
people and ask them for odd jobs

that need_to be clone. ,
4) Read the classified ads in news-
, papers and the GreenASheet.

5) Look for help wanted signs in
stores and fast food restaurants.

6) Think ot any marketable skills
you might have. If you are outstand-
ing in a sport or craft, you may be
able to give lessons.

EMPLOYER
LIBRARY

The Employer Library,
located on the second ﬂoor of
Schenley Hall, has a permanent --
file of company publications,
annual reports, and other infor-‘
mation on more than 1,200
organizations. .

tions before a recruiting date.
Students may use these bro-
chures to prepare for their

By BARRY ZASLOFF ‘ _
Despite speculation that the
rather abrupt departure of
Coach Jackie Sherrill would
set back Pitt's recruiting, the
Panthers continue to wage a
strong battle in the annual war
for rights to the top high school
football talent in America.
Last Monday Panther
recruiters persuaded highly-
touted Andrew Lewis north to
play for Pitt. Lewis, a 6-4, 270-
pound monster of a defensive
lineman ended the ' heated
recruiting war by choosing Pitt
over Texas A8cM and ‘Florida
State. Lewis said “no" to last
ditch efforts to lure him away by
Michigan State coach Muddy
Waters and former Pitr-coach-

l

turned-Aggie Jackie Sherrill.

The first blue-chip recruit
inked by Pitt, and perhaps the
most significant, was Serra
quarterback Rich Bowen, who
at 6-2, 197-pounds is considered
by many the man who will take
snaps from center once Danny
Marino graduates.

Bowen, whose physical size
resembles Marino’s, completed
87 of 139 passes this season for
1,302 yards, en-route to earning
Parade All-America status.
Bowen explained that he chose _
Pitt because of the closeness to V 2
his White Oak home and the
learning experience of playing '
behind Marino.

Another prized recruit
headed toward Pitt is Valley

O

running back Bill Callahan, a
fleet 6-foot, 195-pound halfback
who gained 1,614 yards on 222
carries this season. He has 0
already gained 10 pounds since
the end of high school season,
and Pitt plans to use him at
fullback.

Other recruits include Dar-
nell Stone, a \6-1, 205-pound
back and John Reese, a 6-1, 255-
pounder who plays defensive
tackle and offensive guard, both
of whom left local schools to
attend Milford Academy, a prep

r school tucked-away in Connec-

ticut. Stone left Thomas Jeffer-
son and Reese departed from
Mount Lebanon because of
grade problems.

Another recent signee is John
Congemi, a 6-1, 178-pound
quarterback who was the
Miami Herald Offensive Player
of the Year this year. Congemi,
who completed 63 percent of his
passes for 1,824 yards and 14
touchdowns, narrowed his

Dr. Freud, meet the members of
the St. Bonaventure basketball
team. They are suffering from
acute schizophrenia. The strangest
thing about them: they go on the
road and get blown out by a good
but not great Pitt Pantherteam.
We’re talking 30 points, and it
wasn’t even that close. Then they
go to Rutgers, a perennial power
with arguably the best talent in the
Eastern 8, and beat the Scarlet
Knights 31-29 by holding the
basketball.

There's more. When they play-in
cozy little Reilly Center, an anti-
‘quated building that seats 3600,
they usually win. Actually, it’s
more than usually, it’s almost
automatic. Like better than 85 per-
cent of their games. _ 3

So, if you’re Pitt coach Roy
Chipman, and you know that
Duquesne is coming up on Sun-
day, how do you get your team
motivated for St. Bonaventure on
Thursday with the knowledge that
the first meeting was a farce?

A good way would be to tell your
players that St. Bonaventure is still
very much in the hunt for a home
playoff spot in the first round of_the
Eastern 8 tournament. Pitt is 4-4 in
the league ‘and holds the fourth
spot, 'the last for the home court

Lady Pantherson the Road  

By MARIE HUFF

The Pltt Lady Panther _basket-‘

ball team extended its season

‘record to 14-9 after breaking even
on the road this past weekend. Sat-
urday night in Cleveland, the Lady
Panthers earned a 73-61 win. How-
ever, in Detroit on Sunday after-
noon, Pitt was on the short endof a
70-59 score.

During the first half of the Cleve-
land State contest, the shooting
inside Woodling Gym was as cold
as the weather outside. The Lady
Panthers shot a l)elow-par -10 per-
cent before intermission. Cleve-
land State was experiencing the
satire ptoblein, sinkingonly 39 per-
cent in the first twenty minutes.

 ' ‘he result was a 3»l—3-1- deadlock at

_  . re half.

01

In the second half, Pitt warmed
up considerably, canning two
more field goals than in the first
half despite taking l0 fewer shots.
Meanwhile, the Lady Vikings’

shooting was sinking further into

mediocrity. Cleveland State,
hounded by the Lady Panther
defense, shot a meager 31 percent
inthe second half and Pitt easily
moved on to win 73-6].

Leading the way for the Lady
Panthers was Gail Aughburns
with 18 points and 20 rebounds,
followed by Jennifer Bruce with 17
points and 14 rebounds. The duo
clearly dominated under the boards
the entire night. Debbie Lewis
chipped in 16 points and (Jarol
Dugan poured in 10 for thevictory.

'I‘he’story out of Detroit did not
have a happy ending. The Lady
Panthers started off right where
they left off in (Ileyeland, shooting
57 percent in the opening twenty
minutes. As expected, Detroit
stayed right with Pitt and the Lady.
Panthers had sparse breathing
room at halftime with their 39-38
lead. ' ,_

In the second half, disaster
struck. The Lady Panthers entered

a scoring drought unprecedented
in their eight-year history. While
the University of Detroit kept their
scoring pace constant, the Lady
Panthers managed to put in only
six baskets in the ebtire second half,
for an abysmal 19.4 shooting per-
centage. The Lady Titans sent Pitt
home frustrated with a 70-59 loss.

Debbie Lewis led Pitt with 19
points. jennifer Bruce canned 15,
while ghrabbing 12 rebounds, for
the Lady Panthers. Carol Dugan
also had/_l0 in the scoring column
for Pitt.

But the Lady Panthers are not
finished with their road trip yet.
They still must face their toughest
opponent, archrival Penn State.
Despite the loss of three high

caliber players. the Lady Lions are

currently ranked Hth in the nation
with an l8-=1 record.

advantage. The Bonnies are 4-6'-in
the league, good-for sixth place. A
win could leave them a mere game
away from the Panthers. ,

“We’re in a position to deter-
mine our own fate for the playoffs.
We don’t want to finish the week at
l-l, but at 2-0. The players know
how important it is to win the St.
Bonaventure game,” assistant
coach Reggie Warford said.

When the two teams played Jan. .

20, St. Bonaventure tried to take it

to the Panthers, play with them.‘

What they discovered, however,
was that they were woefully slower
in just about everything. They
were slower off the boards, on
defense and on the break. When
they play tomorrow, St. Bonaven-
ture will undoubtedly show a dif-
ferent look. 4

“We expect St. Bonaventure to
slow it down. What we have to do is
grab a lead and take them out of
their game plan,” Warford said.

The slowdown worked to perfec-
tion against the bigger, more tal-
ented Scarlet*\Knights of Rutgers.

‘ Carefully moving the ball around,

only taking layups, St. Bonaven-
ture yawned its way to a 31-29 win.
The 29 points were the lowest
scored by Rutgers in more than 15
years. _

purists frown upon while others

see it as partiof the immense strate-
gy utilized in this complex game,
can be most effective. It can trans-

'form teams of immense talent into

impatient losers.

.“What we have to do ,is be
patient. We can’t afford to start
fouling,” Warford said-in regards
to the stall.

Obviously quicker, the Panthers
will come out in a full-court press
in an effort to disturb the Bonnies.

‘A good press could lead to some
“easy baskets, then a lead, then

good-bye stall.

Taking the stall out of the game’
is essential. Without it, St. Bona-
venture is -just another team. A
team Pitt has already beaten by 30
points.

Pitt Notes: Dwayne Wallace, who
hasiplayed much better the last two
games, is still anxiously awaiting
the arrival of a new boy or girl due
any day. . . Warford said that “bas-
ketball is not life and death” and
that Wallace has been worried
about his wife. .

The Pitt Lady Panther gymnas-
tics team, led by three old
standbys-——Karen Martin, Holly
Martino and Regina Carson—put
together one of their season’s best
scoring meets to defeat the visiting
Slippery Rock Rockettes last night,
.l39.l0-133.05.

Martin led Pitt’s top finishers
with a win in the vault, a second-
place finish in the uneven bars, and
a third in the balance beam. The
sophomore’s 9.25 score in the vault
tied both Martino and Carson’s
9.25 -in the floor exercise for the
meet’s high scoring honors.

Despite a break in the lastevent,
the floor exercise, Martin still man-

aged to nip Martino to also win the
all-around,_ with 34.95 points to
Martino’s 34.50 points.

Martino and Carson both
excelled ‘in the floor exercise and
tied for first-place with their 9.25
scores. Martino, a senior All-East
performer, also took second in the
vault (8.95), and Carson hit a

beam to win second with a 8.9

score. Slippery Rock’s Julie Mor-

row won thebeam with an 8.95
mark for the Rockettes’ only first-
place on the evening.

In all, Slippery Rock managed to
grab only four of a possible 15 pla-
ces in the meet, as the Lady Pan-
thers “hit everything,” according
to Pitt Coach Donna Sanft. A

“Our goal was to hit everything.
We were going for a perfect meet,
and we came very close,” Sanft said
jubilantly. “It wasa fantastic score.
We didn't have a -meet last week,
and everyone was itchng to get
back into competition. This was
the first time when the physical
came together’ with our mental
attitude.”

Sanft was especially enthused
with the team’s sweep on the
uneven bars and improved scoring
on the balance beam. Roxanne

'i_Evans, whose bad ankle limits her

to just the unevens, won the event
with a 9.05 score, followedby Mar-
tin (9.0) and Gretchen Speich (8.7).
On the balance beam, the Lady
Panthersseem to have found a for-
mulafor greater success——practice,
practice and more practice.
“We’ve really been killing the
beam in practice and it paid off
tonight," Sanft said. “Everyone
was hitting. We’re just going to
keep on practicing like we have
been. _We’ve really been

improving." ,
The Lady Panthers, now 3-2 on
the season, will need all the

improvement they can muster Sat-
urday when Penn State, last year's
No. 2-ranked team for most of the
season, visits Pitt’s Trees Hall. The
Lady Lions pack a high scoring
lineup led by sophomore Heidi
Anderson, one of the nation's top-
ranked all-around gymnasts last
season. Pitt’s only loss in 12 meets
last year was against Penn State, at
State College.

Though Pitt sophomore ‘All-
Arrrerica Lisa Shirk is still not fully
recovered from a recent ankle oper-
ation, she did compete last night in
the u_neven bars. At last season’s

;EasternRegional meet at Pitt, the

duel fin the all-around between

3 Shirk and,Anderson was one of the if
.highlights_.of the meet. '. - '

  Matey Joins Sherrill  

Va’

  

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

()n an eve when most high school

football recruits are making their '

last-minute decisions about which
college to attend, Pitt lost another
kind of recruiting battle to Texas
.=\8cM and ex—Pitt Coach Jackie
Sherrill yesterday.

Bob Matey, defensive line coach

for the past nine seasons at Pitt, has“ 

decided to join Sherrill in a similar
part-time capacity at Texas A8cM.
The 31-year old Matey, who has

spent all of his 14 years in colle- _,

giate football working under Sher-
rill as a player and a coach, called
the choice to leave Pitt “the biggest
I've ever made.

“I want to have other avenues to
take and I-don’t plan to spend the
rest of my life coaching. The busi-
ness opportunities are just better
down there,” Matey explained. “A

lot of people are going to say I left ‘_

friends, won’t-accept why I’m leav-
ing. I’m sure- some will be angry.”

After making a tentative decision
Saturday, two days after last week’s
visit to the A&M campus in College
Station, Matey said he “tracked
down" one of his players, sopho-
more Bill Maas, to tell him he was
leaving.

“He could see it in my face. He

kind of knew what I was going to

say," Matey recalled. “I told him,
‘Do you know people down there
need guidance?’ and Bill just
shrugged and said, ‘Oh, and we
don’t?’ He feels I deserted him. I
guess I have to expect that.”

Still, expectations don’t soothe
the conscience like,a few under-
standing words can, and Matey
admits as much. He says he hopes
he can still, “return to Pittsburgh
with my head up high when I see
my old friends. I hope this won’t

for A8cM becauseiof all the money, 7 i i I

but that’s not it at all. Jackie andI

"haven’t even ‘talked money yet.”«

After almost a decade at Pitt,
Mafey said he turned down new
head coach Foge Fazio’s offer to
stay because, “after nine years, you
get very comfortable, safe and
secure in a place. It’s tough leaving
Pittsburgh, but I’m not getting any
younger. Houston and Dallas are
growing so big so quickly, there are

so many business -opportutn-it-ies~

that, a chance like this only comes
along once.”

And so, with his desire to
develop career alternatives for his

‘life after coaching, Matey seized the

opportunity, but not without deep
remorse, he said, especially
towards’ the players he leaves

behind.

“It’s hard. You teach them loy-
alty and all that all the time and
then pick up and leave. They’re
bound to be hurt. I understand
that—_I would be too,” Matey said.
“When,I played, I had a coach who

left and I felt cheated, left out. My

big worry now is that people, my

      
 
        
         
         
      
     
  
     

 

matter. Right now, I feel bad.”
hough he has yet to determine
with details of when he’s leaving,
what other university jobs he’ll do
for A8cM and what his salary will
be, Matey expects to depart for
Texas within four or five days. The
thought of moving to a place like
College Station, “a low~key place
that reminds me of Ames, Iowa, the
town where I went to college,” and
working with an up—and-coming
team like the Aggies, 8-4 last year,
brighten Matey’s thoughts about
leaving.
But make no mistake, it will not
be easy.
_"‘I imagine it would be best to
just go in a stupor,” Matey said.
“But. .now is’ the time to do

grown-up things, and grown-ups
don’t cry.”

Perhaps. Or more likely, some
won’t admit it.

so:

By TIM DINGER

The Pitt wrestling team was
handed three losses over the week-
end while salvaging‘ only one
victory. .

Friday night the Panthers fellto
Bloomsburg, 29-11, in'a match that
could have been much closer. On
Saturday, Pitt started strong by
beating Liberty Baptist 33-7, but
then lost to 17th ranked Navy 32-7,
andvseventh-ranked North Caroli-
na, 32-14.

Pitt Coach Rande Stottlemyer
commended sophomore 158-
pounder Jeff Jelic, who went 3-0-1
over the weekend and freshman
Dennis Atiyeh, who went 3-1, for
their outstanding jobs. Stottlemyer
also mentioned the good perfor-
mances of Craig Richey, Doug
Haines and Joe Throckmorton, all
of whom went 2-2.

The bad luck that plagued Pitt
in the loss to West Virginia last
week returned in this week’s
Bloomsburg match as the Panthers
lost two, matches in the final
seconds. And like last week, it was a
Panther default and a Bloomsburg
win that accounted for Pitt’s losing
margin.

Tom Cummings of Bloomsburg
got the opening points by beating
Rich Esswein, 4-2, at 118 pounds.
In the next match, Panther Joe
Throckmorton received a third

By LISA GRENEVICKI

The Pitt Panther_ indoor soccer
club played erratically at times,

and spectacularly at times this past 
weekend, to finish with just one ,—.‘; .

win in four tries, at the Wheeling
College Tournament . in West
Virginia. - _ -

The Panthers fell prey to Wright
State of Dayton, Ohio, in their first
match. 4-l.

According to Pitt Head Coach
Leo Bemis, in that game the Panth-
ers “hadn"t arrived yet.” ,Wright
State had no standouts, but beat
Pitt with a balanced attack.

Pitt went on to tie Alderson-
Broaddus, 2-2, and then beat a
good, strong Northern Kentucky
team, 5-2. Then in their final pool
match, Pitt lost to Geneva College,
7-6. i

“We were hammering the day-
lights out of Geneva, but we wer-
en’t scoring,” said Bemis.

Down by a score of 7-2, the
Panther booters rallied for four
goals in the second half, but Gen-
eva hung on for the victory. '

“If we played as well in the first
half as we (lid in the second, we
might have beat them,” said Bemis.

—~——-.»1‘We.jvust »weren’t playing good

defense.” -

A highlight of the tournament,
according to Bemis was the fine
play of freshman goalie Dave Ghi-
lani and the emergence of s()me

’S[l"OI1g SCOYCTS. /
2.

Sophomore Nick Wilson and
junior Eric Tiedtke led the scorers
with three goals each, followed by‘
junior Troy Norton, sophomore
Gerry Wasson, and freshman Jim
Steele, with two goals each. Junior
john Hagenbuch and sophomore
Don Bowen added a goal each to
the Pitt effort.

“I used Ghilani to give him a
chance to be in charge," Bemis
said. “He responded well. We
accomplished something there. It
was a definite plus.”

With the graduation of last sea-
son's goalie Scott Thunberg, Ghi-
lani’s play was reassuring for next
fall and regular season play. 

“This weekend was a learning
experience,” added Bemis. “It
showed we can score goals when we
put our mind to it. We can puta lot
of pressure on a team, but we must
be careful of our defense. We have I
to make sure we play a balanced
game.”

The Pitt booters’ next competi-
tion will be this weekend at the
Carnegie-Mellon Indoor Soccer
Tournament.

The CMU tournament will fea- -
ttire 16 teams, grouped into pools
of four. Thetop two teams in each
pool will enter an eight-team sin-
gle elimination round.

.The field will include two teams ‘
from West Virginia Wesleyan, two
teams from Bethany, Upper St.
Clair of the Keystone League,
Slippery Rock, and “Indiana of
Pennsylvania.

“Wesleyan and Bethany are
always lough,” said Bemis. “Indi-
ana surprised everyone down in
Wheeling, beating West Virginia.”

Bemis uses the indoor season to
help the team gain playing expe-
rience. He will use Phil Spana, a
new goalie, at the CMU tourna-
ment. Spana often worksiout with
the Pittsburgh Spirit and Bemis
said he’ll “give him a shot to play.”§-

"(.'lVlU Wlll be a good tourna-
ment with some strong teams,"
said Bemis. “We'll be out to
improve our defense and still
attack well.”~ . . e 1

_§Bergan: A Different All-America

' backstroke title and placed third in

By SEAN BARNES

The only way wild, untamed Pitt

freshman Ed Bergan will ever be

- associated with the All-American
boy image is if the supremely tal-
ented backstroker earns the tag in a
swimming pool.

Although his competitive swim
career has covered.only two-thirds
of his inital season, Bergan has
already been held out of one meet

’ for disciplinary reasons by Pitt
 Coach Fred Lewis. While Bergan’s
fisometimes individualistic, some-
times radical approach to training

has been a point of contention this

season, no one is arguing with his‘

results.

Though only a freshma_n, Ber-
gan is rankedifirst in the Eastiin the
100- and 200-yard backstroke, and
seems a good bet to win All-
America honors later this year at
the NCAA Nationals. His 100-yard
split time of 53.0 in a meet before
Christmas, had it come in an open
event and not in a relay leg, would
have broken current Eastern and
Pitt record for the distance held by
ex-Pitt star Stu Swanson, an eight-
time Eastern champion in the

. - backstroke.

(:14 And so, even if Bergan does
appear to be the Reggie Jackson of
the Pitt team, as long as his times
keep improving and he doesn't dis-
turb anyone else’s training, its dif-
ficult to attack his individualistic
approach to the sport.

Throughout his swim career,
Bergan has bristled when he felt
unduly restricted. After a distin-
guished career in age-group swim-
ming clubs, Bergan attended Kiski
Prep High School, a private school
renowned for its swim team. The
stiff rules and regulations there
grated against Bergan’s loose and
untamed character. After two-and-
one-half years, he transferred to
East Allegheny High School near
his home.

During his high school years,
Bergan was one of many current
Pitt swimmers who trained under
Lewis in the Pitt Aquatic Club.
During his three~years with the
PAC, Bergan set a state record win-
ning-the 100-yard state high school

HAVE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT?
. HAVE SOMETHING TO
‘ SELL?

‘The Pitt News, Wednesday, February 10, 1982

the 200-yard backstrokr Bergan
credits the high finishes to the
quality training he received with
the PAC.

“I’ve been on three or four clubs
before Pitt," Bergan said, “but
where the training was adequate,
the overall psych was down. Some-
thing was always missing. But at
Pitt, we have the weights, the pool,
the coach—everything I need and
want, basically."

For many swimmers, Pitt’s

‘abbreviated six—meet schedule

would seem too short, but not to
Bergan.

“What usually happens is ‘you ‘

turn in some good pre-Christmas
times at three meets or so. This
helps your psych to train at ‘Christ-
mas Kill.’ Then, in the seven or
eight meets after, you start off
poorly because of all the long dis-
tance, maximum yardage work

you’ve done over Christmas. You ‘

start to think things are wrong that
aren't really wrong. You're just
worn out and tired, and you're
ready for the tapering period
ahead.” 

Bergan added the grind of pre-,
paring mentally for a heavy sche-
dule of meets can also take its toll.

“Some meets you feel fine, but
the heat of the meet may be missing
because you just had one last Satur-
day and you’ve got another one
next Saturday,” Bergan explained.
“Our short schedule has everyone
driving for their best times at every
meet. Sure, it’s a lot of pressure, but
you ought to see Nationals!” ’

With Nationals looming ahead
March 25-26, the Panthers get their
last regglar season chance to qual-
ify Saturday against Indiana. Pitt’s
practices lately have been more spe-
cialized with the sprinters, individ-.
ual medley swimmers, breaststrok-
ers and long-distance freestylers
alll swimming different workouts.
Bergan and the rest of his Panther
teammates are concentrating on

refining their particular events as .

the time grows shorter and shorter
until the days the final test-—
NCAA Easterns and ‘Nationals-
arrive.

Pitt will host the NCAA Eastern '

Regionals March 4-6 at Trees Hall.
