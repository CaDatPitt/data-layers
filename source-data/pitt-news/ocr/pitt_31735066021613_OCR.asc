Pitt President J. Dennis
O’Connor announced yesterday
that Pitt has received a $5 million
grant from the United States Air
Force to establish a national
materials—research center.

The center will do research
and development in biological
and technological fields,
according to O’Connor.

“Here in Pittsburgh, at this
national‘ center of excellence,
some of the best engineers and
scientists in the world will be
creating new materials for the
21st century,” O’Connor said.

The funding will be used to

support the first two years of
operation at the center, which
will be headed by Sanford Asher
of the chemistry department and
Fred Pettit of the engineering
department.

According to Pettit, “$5 million
is a seed fund and will be the
basis for other funding.”

Associate Provost for Research
Wilfred W. Daehnick, said that
some funding for the third year
of the center is “already being
made available” from other areas
of the university.

Daehnick said that $1.1 million I

has already been earmarked as

university support through the

first three years of the project.
The university funding was

made available by the Office of-

Research, the dean of Faculty of
Arts and Sciences, the dean of
Engineering and will also include
“a lot of computer services” from
the Computing Center, according
to Daehnick.

Daehnick admitted that more
outside income will be needed to
keep the center going. “Our
outside income is mainly from
the government and private
foundations.”

At the present time the center
will be spread across the various
schools and departments, but
Pettit did not rule out the
possibility of building a materials-
science building in the future.

According to Asher and Pettit,

planning for a materials Research
Center began five years ago.

Some of the uses for the center
will include high- performance
structure materials, electro-optical
systems, new catalysts and
biotechnology.

The center hopes to develop
new metal alloys and coatings
which would be resistant to high
heat and corrosion. Some of the
possible uses would be in aircraft
engines and paint for car bodies.

Other areas of research will
involve developing new

Even though the center is
funded by the military, “No

performed at the center,” Pettit
said.

“There is a need to establish a

The modern view of ancient Greek civilization is the
product of biased and prejudiced 19th-century historians,
according to author Martin Bernal.

Bernal, who has published two books in the
controversial series Blacle Athena, spoke at Pitt Law

Bernal said that 18th— and 19th-century historians
intentionally excluded the role of black Egyptians and
Phoenicians in the development of Greek civilization.

“Nobody in their right mind would try to study
Japanese cultural tradition or philosophy without first
making reference to Chinese models and instances.
That's precisely what the classicists have done by
ignoring Egypt in their study of ancient Greece. They’re
trying to walk on one leg,” Bernal said.

Because western culture is largely based upon Greek
ideals and philosophy, Bernal believes that his
“revisionist” views of Hellenictimes will serve to
“lessen European cultural arrogance” among historical

To better clarify the reasons behind such
misconceptions, Bernal divided ancient history into
two schools of thought: the Aryan and the ancient.

“The Aryan model is the one that I was taught when
I was in school and when I was in college. Those of you
who have studied ancient Greece

“According to this model, Greece had originally been
inhabited by tribes who had lived in idyllic simplicity,
when along had come Egyptians and Phoenicians 
who had set up cities and had introduced the art of
civilization to the entire population,” Bernal said.

Bernal later said that such interaction between the
- Greeks and the Egyptians was “highly plausible” because
of the short distance between the Balkan peninsula and

This view persisted even in 18th-century times, when

forbearers of modern geometry, according to Bernal.

“Obviously, geometry is a fundamental part of
architecture, so they were interested in geometry.
Egypt was held in very high esteem as a source of
reason and rationality,” Bernal said.

According to Bernal, the ancient view of Greek his-

a European return to Christianity.

According to Berna], Romantics who idealized peoples
of the cold north as “tough, heroic and chaste” didnft

ORL sponsors alcohol awareness program

By Matt Major
For The Pitt News

In an effort to promote
responsible use of alcohol, the
Office of Residence Life and the
Tower A staff kicked off Alcohol
Awareness Week in the Towers
lobby yesterday.

The two—day event is designed
to make residents more aware of
the alternatives to alcohol.

Dave Hornyak, Tower A
resident director, said, “We’re here
to promote responsible drinking.
It’s a matter of choices - when to
drink and when not to drink.”

The staff of resident assistants
set up tables that provided a
variety of attractions.

At one table there were free
cups and keychains available to
all who ﬁlled out an alcohol
survey. The survey was offered
by the Office of Residence Life to
identify students’ perceptions and

attitudes with regard to alcohol

use. It asked about students’
speciﬁc drinking habits, including:

-How many times a week do
you drink?

-What do you drink?

-What percentage of your time
does your socializing with others
involve alcohol?

-Does drinking increase your
self-confidence?

0 Have you ever thought about
the long-term consequences of
your. drinking?

According to Hornyak, the
survey was intended to get a
“general idea of people’s attitudes
toward drinking. It’s not scientific
or anything, but we can use it to
gauge how the residents feel
about drinking,” Hornyak said.

The resident assistants also
enlisted the aid of several local
bartenders who volunteered their
time to mix non-alcoholic
cocktails for the’ students to
sample. Bud Haggerty, a
bartender at T.G.I. Friday’s, said,
“You can walk into any bar and
order non~alcoholic drinks.”

At another table a poster

Now that the school year is
under way, students living off-
campus in rental housing are
adjusting to the change in seasons.
So what if your heat is not turned
on during a week when the
temperature reaches 30 degrees
every night? It might be a good

a idea to know your rights as a

tenant.

About 66 percent of University
of Pittsburgh students live off-
campus. That's a large number,
considering the size of the student
population. Know Y0urRz'g/Jtswill
try to answer some of the basic
questions usually asked in relation

A to renting in Pittsburgh.

Question: What should I know
about a lease?

Answer: The lease is a written or
oral agreement between the
landlord and the tenant. It is a
legally binding document. In
other words, make sure you read
the lease in its entirety before

‘signing it. You will be responsible
- for the content of the lease.

Q: How can my landlord evict
me?

8 A: You can be evicted for non-

payment of rent, when your lease
expires or “ for cause.” When your
lease expires and you do not
renew or are not asked to renew,
you leave. That is straightforward.

For non-payment of rent or
some violation of the lease, such
as destroying property or
disturbing your neighbors, your
landlord will have to follow legal
channels. You cannot just find
your belongings on the street
one night. The same holds true in

habitability

“for cause” evictions. Your
landlord will have to prove that
you disturb your neighbors or
destroy the rental property.

It is important to remember,
your landlord cannot evict you.
Only the courts can evict a tenant.
Also, a landlord cannot hold
your property hostage in
retaliation against you.

Q: What is the Implied
Warranty of Habitability?

A: The implied warranty of
is simply the
guarantee that the landlord
provide livable housing. This
translates into you do not have to
pay for what you do not receive.
If a landlord cannot. supply you
with livable housing, you need
not pay yourrent.

If you do not have heat during
January, this could easily be seen
as a breach of the warranty. Your
home is not habitable. The
warranty may not apply, however,
if you do not have heat in July.

You can move out of your
rental if it is not habitable. If you
move out, though, the landlord
may take you to court. In court,

apartment

you will be asked to prove that
the landlord violated the implied
warranty of habitability. For legal
advice, you may choose to contact
an attorney or some other agency.
Q: Can I receive interest on
my security deposit?

A: Yes, but only after the security
deposit has been held over a
year. The interest will be based
on market standards.

Q: What about discrimination

inhousing?
A: Housing discrimination is
illegal in Pittsburgh, in

Pennsylvania and in the U.S.
Different laws apply. In Pittsburgh
it is illegal to discriminate in
housing based on race, religion,
sex, sexual orientation, ethnic
background, ancestry, color,
national origin or handicap. You
can pursue discrimination
complaints through the Pittsburgh
Human Relations Commission at
255-2600.

Q: Where can I go for more
information on housing
issues?

A: The Fair Housing Line at 462-

Game celebrations cause clear/z—up woes

By Gary Knapick
Staff Writer ‘

As Pitt student Matt Dudek
wandered through the aftermath
of Sunday’s postgame revelry in
the Schenley Quad yesterday
morning, he couldn’t help
wondering why the residents
went to such great lengths to
litter the buildings’ parking circle.

“I could understand if they won
the World Series, but this is just a
game,” said Dudek, who is
employed by the Housing and
Food Services’ department of
support services through a work-
study program.

Dudek and another custodian

have been charged with the task
of picking up streams of toilet
paper and reams of shredded
paper that have draped the trees
and littered the sidewalks of the
Schenley Quad after every Pirate
playoff victory.

“They’re just rounding up every
piece of toilet paper they can get
their hands on,” said Gill Schaffer,
housekeeping superintendent for
the Schenley Quad.

“We go through this every time,”
Schaffer said.

“It’s OK to celebrate, but not
every damn game, if you’ll pardon
my French,” said Jack Packard,
manager of the Schenley Quad.

Packard denied rumors that

toilet paper supplies to the
Schenley Quad may be cut off
until the World Series is over, but
he said that students are only
hurting themselves through their
celebrations.

“Because of this, we have to‘

pull guys from other [jobsl,”
Packard said.

“It costs a lot of money. There’s
a lot of toilet paper out there,”
Schaffer said. .

Support services’ personnel
expressed concern over what
might happen if the Pirates go on
to greater victories.

“I can imagine whatwill happen
if we win the World Series,”
Schaffer said.

Pettit said that this will involve a “special emphasis on small
industry,” and the program is looking at ways to help transfer
the technology to them and other industries. _

The center is expected to employ post-doctoral scientists as
well as graduate studies, Asher said.

“Students and faculty from historically black colleges” will also
be involved in the research, Pettit said.

Originally, four major colleges were competing for the research
grant, with the last main competitor being Cornell University.

Daehnick said he felt Pitt would not have received the grant
if it did not already have a strong materials-research program.

O’Connor also took the time to restate that Pitt will receive
another $5 million over the next five years from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to become the mid-

Center network. It will be one of six that NASA is establishing

 New charge for basketball

‘ ‘In the past the University of Pittsburgh was the only Big
East team that didn’t charge for basketball tickets. Tickets
7Cused to go “on sale” at the William Pitt Union ticket office
on a designated day, before a game.. ,
Now the policy has been altered to allow the Student
Activities Office more funding.
Under the new plan, Pitt basketball tickets will cost
3 -students $24 per season. The only other school whose
tickets are at such a low cost is fellow Big East Conference
member Providence College, where_ students pay $36
dollars per season to attend their team's home games.
Another Big East opponent, Syracuse University, charges
‘students a whopping $109 per season for basketball
' A (tickets. - .
, This year the money, added to the revenue Student
‘Activities gains from its yearly fee of $52 (for full-time
r students), will be divided up between the spirit committee,
renovations in the William Pitt Union and the addition of

 

 
   
  
  
  
 
   
  
   

for the home games.

A Each year the priorities of Student Activities programs
will change, thereby shifting the distribution of the added
basketball funds.

Pitt sports suffer from a lack of fan support as it is, as
, recent attendance at football games have shown. To ask
students to pay $2 per game may be asking too much. It
is a strong possibility that student attendance at basketball
., games will decrease substantially if they are forced to pay
for a, ticket.

, The Panthers already play three games in the spacious
 Civic Arena. Students received. free tickets to those games
as well as the ones in the Fitzgerald Field House. However
Pitt failed to fill all 16,000 seats for any of those games last
year. If they begin charging students for the tickets as..
 well, the possibility ‘for filling the arenaldecreases even

more.

’ Basketball has always been a faction of Pitt sports. This
V sudden realization that one more sportcan be considered
» _a student activity is just another example of Pitt and its’
organizations attempting to swindle money out of its
“ already suffering students. , —

. But according to Student Government Board President

1 Brent Saunders, after a petition of students last year
0 proved overwhelmingly in favor of the new cost of
.7 tickets, the SGB and Student Activities Office decided to
go ahead with the proposal. Of the survey, Saunders said,
"Close to one thousand said ‘yes’ and only one said 'no."'

The money will also be used to purchase items such as
pompons, much like those distributed at the pep rally on
Oct. 3.

Pompons, shakers and other “spirit” items are not
exactly necessary to boost the energy or student support
for our teams. The goal is to first get students in the arenas,
and by forcing students to pay for admission, this primary
goal can be expected to backfire.

Langston Hughes must have
been on to something when he
wrote this poem. He must have
realized the problems society
would have identifying its many
different groups of people. When
we identify’ ourselves by some
name, we are displaying our pride
in our heritage. The problem arises
when groups are labeled not by
their cultural heritage but by their
race and religion.

America, the great melting pot,
where people have mixed since
its conception, is also the land
where people are constantly
ostracized for those same
characteristics that determine their
identity. Racism and segregation
existed on an institutional basis
for a majority of this country’s

existence, and to the present day ,

it exists in other forms. But it was
that specific period of slavery that
created the greatest amount of
racial mixing. The offspring of
African slaves and their white
slaveholders are a part of today’s
America.

America, the land of the free, is
also the home of hypocrisy. It is
unfortunate that we do not
practice what we want others to
believe.

‘Prejudice exists in all forms,
but it is the form of prejudice
based on skin color that is truly
disheartening.

Whites discriminate against
blacks. Blacks discriminate against

Identity can be difficult to decide

against other whites. Asians
discriminate against other Asians,
and blacks discriminate against
other blacks. The cycle of
discrimination invades all aspects
of society-

discrimination are grave injustices 7

of humanity, but the greatest
injustice occurs when a group
discriminates against its own.
There are many people in
America who can empathize with

‘Langston Hughes in_that “being

neither black nor white,” they
find it difficult to ‘gain entry into
black or white America. It is
unfortunate that in times of
desperation, when groups need
to‘ unite against a common
adversary, they instead turn
toward self—defeating inﬁghting.
There are no specific reasons for
this kind of self-destruction.
‘We all have seen it in some
way or another: the day-to-day
jealousy and envy for others of
our ethnic origin; the battle
between light— and dark—skinned
blacks; upper—class and middle-
class whites’ loathing for “poor
white trash” and the hatred that
“poor whites” transfer onto blacks
through their own jealousies.

It is difficult to contemplate the
extent to which racism has
permeated our everyday lives.
This curse of humanity has caused
many of us to question our true
selves and come to grips "with
exactly who we are.

When people are constantly
being bombarded with labels and
names as to what group they
belong to or who they “should”
identify with, many Americans
end up losing themselves in the
great quicksand of interracial
make—up.

For those of us who are
products of mixed marriages, our
place in society is a constant
struggle in limbo. “Being neither
black nor white,” we find
ourselves struggling to gain

Racism. ..and.... ,
'”Somewhere along the way, our

admission into black and white
society. Our identity is usually
looked down upon by others
who view us as not being of
“pure” stock. Instead of being
accepted by both of our cultures,
those of us who are mixed tend
to be ostracized. This creates
problems for all of society and
notjust for those directly affected.

The irony of the situation is
.t.hat.-r..1.0. one is. truly “Pure-”

blood and someone else’s-blood

r mingled. Our identity should not
be determined by the color of our

skin or by our cultural heritage. It
shouldbe determined by our own
thoughts’ and actions.’ _

We must look at ourselves as
individuals before we label

ourselves as a group. Once you -

accept a label, you do not have
the opportunity to remove
yourself from that specific identity
group.

Your identity should belong to

‘you and you alone. Look into

yourself, and when you find what
you have been searching for,
identify and name it. That name
should be yours.

Deciding who we are is
something that I’m sure many of
us contemplate every dayof our
existence;and itwill be a question
that has no definite answer.

I have looked at myself, and I
feel comfortable with my identity
— however mixed it might be. I
know where I come from, and I
know where I’m going.

My past is full of different
choices and different identities,
but they have all come together
to form my. own personal identity.
You can choose your own identity
and determine the course of your
life.

_ But you must not forget your
past, for in the words of Langston
Hughes, “I wonder where I’m

-gonna die, being neither white

nor black.” The past is what truly
identiﬁes who you are, and it is
the past that will make your future.
Be proud. Peace.

There comes a time in every team’s
career when credibility is on the line,
when the athletes and coaches find out
how good they ‘really are, when talk is
cheap and excuses wear thin.

At this past weekend's City
Championships, Pitt’s cross—country
program was at that line and responded
the only way it knew how: with a
convincing victory.

“This race was somethingl had to do for

myself,” head coach Jim Lear said. “More ’

importantly, this weekend established
respect for the kids themselves. They
deserve the championship because they

EPITT NEWS 

earned it.”

“The kids” were certainly a sight to see.
Displaying their patented audacious front
running, both the men and women totaled
a mere 18 points to set back local teams
Duquesne (2nd), Carnegie Mellon (3rd)
and Robert Morris (4th place). '

On the women’s side, Carmela Mariani
took the individual victory in a personal-
best time of 17:43 for the hilly, 2.9-mile
course. Laura O’Donnell followed in 17:45,
which is also her personal record.

“I never knew of anybody running under
18 minutes for this course,” Lear said. “You
can’t find a tougher course in this region.”

Stacey Wyzykowski (18:15), Jen Hrach
(18:38) andJudy Facey (19; 10) also battled
Schenley Park’s steep inclines and tight

turns to round out the Lady Panthers’ ever-
tightening pack.

For the Panthers’ men, the race turned
out to be nothing but a competition against
themselves.

There were no surprises up front for the
Pitt harriers. Mike Formica set a meet
record with his 24:45 time for the 4.8-mile
course. Teammate Jason Bodnar took the
runner-up position in 24:53.Behind them
came a flood of blue and gold. With the
exception of Duquesne’s first-year
workhorse, Darby Reed (3rd in 25:06), no
team was able to crack Pitt’s top 10.

“I think we really took a step forward
this weekend,” Lear said. “The third through
seventh runners were only separated by
23 seconds, and if Torn [Swartoutl and

 

Pete [Beehler] hadn’t run into injury
recently, we might have seen seven guys
running together.”

Leading the second pack was Steve
Forrester in 25:25 (4th place), Mike Lynn,
in a personal-record performance of 25:26
(5th); Craig.Woshner, 25:32 (6th) and first-
year harrier Frank Nesko, with a
breakthrough performance of 25:36 (7th).

“Frank is operating in a body of a 10th
grader,” Lear said. “Once he matures
physically, his mental toughness will make
him very hard to deal with.”

Brian McCollough gave another strong
effort for Pitt in 25:48. Tom Swartout came
back with a 26:14 performance, and Pete
Beehler finished in 26:16.

“Panthers drop road match to Villanova, 3-1 in OT

Jason Hillman/T he Pitt News

Eric Prex had the Panthers’ lone goal Sunday. Pfex leads" the team in scoring this season.

By Brian Gallagher
sum“ Writer '

Forward Joe Roy scored two
overtime goals to propel host
Villanova past Pitt 3-1 Sunday
afternoon in Philadelphia. The
loss keeps the Panthers winless
in Big East competition (0-3-2),
and their overall record now
stands at 5-3-3.

After a scoreless first half the

 Wildcats struck first on a goal by

defender Chris Hogan, who
converted a feed’ from midfielder
Scott Aimetti with a shot from 15
yards out. ’
“Despite being outshot 29-14,
the Panthers sent the game into
overtime on a late goal by striker
Eric Prex.
After recovering a deflected

“through ball” by midfielder Ted -

Noethling, junior Mark Brehm
sent a low—crossing pass from the
left corner of the field. Prex, who
leads the Pitt squad with seven
goals and 17 points, slid and one-
timed the ball past ‘Nova
goalkeeper Mike Guarino. The
game-tying goal came with less
than four minutes left and sent
the game into overtime.

Despite the fact that the Panthers
were tied at the end of regulation,
Pitt assistant coach Heinz Pak

wasn’t happy with the team’s play.
“We played OK, but [we] looked
so unorganized,” he said.. He
added that although the game
was played on a smaller field,
which limited Pitt’s speed and
use of sideline offensive runs, it
was no excuse for the team’s
inconsistent play.

,“We’ll put together 15 to 20
minutes of solid soccer and then
have a_breakdown,” he said. The
“breakdown” against the Wildcats
occurred late in the first overtime
period. Pitt surrendered two
breakaway goals within a period
of 80 seconds and was unable to
recover.

Mental breakdowns and
mistakes have proven costly to
the team throughout the course
of the season. During the end of
a well-played first half against
Connecticut, two misplays and
failures to clear the defensive
zone resulted in two quick goals
and changed the course of the
game _(won by UConn, 4-O).

Pak ‘finds it particularly

frustrating as a coach when all he *

can do is preach and hope the
team follows through with head
coachJoe Luxbacher’s game plan.
“They have to realize that what
coach Luxbacher tells them will

Mens tennis remains unbeaten with win oz/erCanisius

By Rob Pugliese
Staff Writer

The 3 men’s tennis team
improved its record to a perfect
5-0 with a 6-3 victory over Canisius
College yesterday at the Cost
Center. This match was over as
quickly as it began, with the
Panthers registering three quick
victories.

Larry Garrard displayed a
powerful serve-and-volley game
in whipping Don Nowak 6-1, 6-
4 and raised his mark to 4-1.

Joel Orth also moved to 4-1
with a 6-4, 6-0 victory over Pete
Shaugnessy, while James
Chronister breezed to another
"straight-set victory, beating Mark
Rush 6-1, 6-4..

“My serve and volley, together
they’ve been the biggest factors
in my success,” Garrard said. “I’ve
been happy and yet also

displeased with my play because ,

I didn’t play particularly well at
the Big East.”

Scott Smith gave Pitt a 4-0 bulge
with a 6-4, 7-6 win over Scott
Gordon. Smith, a transfer from

Jacksonville University, possesses .

the finest mark on the team at 6-
0.

Smith said that Gordon wasn’t
a difficult opponent for him, but
he felt the effects of a nasty bout
with the flu.

“I didn’t play for the past two
weeks. I’d been sick, and I was
just getting back into the swing of
things,” Smith said. “My serve

and my footwork was good, and
I was able to place the shots
where I wanted to and make
them move.”

Although he was very pleased
with the performance, Smith said
he needsto work on his backhand
and improve his footwork.

The final two singles decisions
went. to Canisius, slicing Pitt’s
lead to 4-2.

Eric Weaver ‘fell to John
Udwadia 7-5, 3-6, 0-6, and in a
hard—fought match John Tegano
finally succumbed to Wadia
Kuwar 6-7, 6-2, 4-6. The
previously unbeaten Tegano fell
to 4-1 for the season.

Despite falling to 1-3 for the
season, Weaver was pleased with
his performance against Canisius.

“I played fairly well today, so
I’m not upset," Weaver said.
“Every school has a good No.1
player, and it's difficult to do
exceptionally well when you’re
always going against the top
player. I need to try to get to the
net more instead of being strictly
a baseliner.”

Weaver said that Pitt’s doubles
combinations have played
particularly well, citing that as
the major reason for the team’s
success thus far.

Weaver also noted the depth of
this squad.

“The middle portion of the
lineup is strong. I think we win
most of our matches because of
them,” he said.

Doubles once again showed

the Panthers’ strength with
Tegano and Chronister dusting
Nowak and Rush by scores of 6-
2, 6-3.

It was the first time this

combination played together
since last season, when the two
posted a 3-3 mark together.
' They reunited because of a
shoulder injury to Dave Ginder,
who is normally Chronister’s
partner. '

Weaver and Smith gave Pitt a 6-
2 lead, cruising to a 6-2, 6-3 win
over Gordon and Shaugnessy,
but Canisius’ team of Udwadia
and Kuwar held off Garrard and
Orth‘ in a tough 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 win
to conclude the match. Weaver
and Smith currently hold a 4-0

work," Pak said. “It’s like what your
mother used to say to you: ‘You hear, but
you just don’t listen.’ They hear us, but
they go on the field and do something
different." I

Pak said that after playing at Pitt and on
the professional level, it's disheartening
to help and not see results during the
game.

He said he is beginning to have a better

understanding of why coaches get so
upset and disenchanted when their teams
don’t perform.

Pitt hopes to rebound this Wednesday
night when it faces West Virginia in
Morgantown.

If the Panthers expect to win, they’ll
need to return to solid, mistake-free
soccer anchored by team defense. When
asked about the WVU game, Pak stated
the obvious: “We need a win.”
