Mayor'William A. Magee delivered
the: address at the general assembly
in Soldiers,-Memorial. Hall last Wed-
nesday". .-Chancellor J.‘ G. -Bowman-
lpresided. The subject of the mayor's
address was “Op-portunitiesjfor the
College Man in Politics.” The_ may-
or’s speech was as follows:_ ‘ "

people are, "formally 'traini_ng_ them-_
selves for the public service." Never-
theless, some of those preparing for
other vocations have the desire ‘for
and keep in mind more or less con-
sciously the possibility of- a‘ public
career. It is often _a matterof ac-
-cident later,on whether or not‘-they‘
actually do engage in -—~politics;‘.f While
going to» college they are interested
enough to become somewhat‘ inform
ed as to current events. ,They alsin
learn so‘me’thing-of social, economic
and political theory. But they do not
study these sciences deeply. This we
know from the fact most of our pub-
lic men offer a successful experience
-at the bar, or.in business or mp0-
litical organization when they ‘make
a bid for public attention.”

“I could be much more certain of
my ground and speak more interest-
ingly of why we do nothave a train-
ed profession of publicservants than

a few suggestions «to ,those".who do
havesome disposition towards‘ 'public
affairs." Before that let me enuinerate
the obstacles. A political life is al-
ways insecure and often brief. The
pecuniary compensation -is meagre in
comparison with the rewards" earned
in other paths of endeavor. The op-
portunities for. constructive accom-
plishment is very limited because of
the constitutional check upon each
delegated -power -by otheiypowers;
“Now of these various deterrents
to political effort the ‘last is ; themost
.Si£.wifi.cant- . .Qur..;eonstit.1.it_iobg1__ _fsy§t.em.
of checks and balances.’, devised -to
save us from the designs of the cor-
rupt and the over-ambitious, Land the
blunders of the ignorant, ‘at the same
time deprives us of the .-service of
much talent. Then as against the
meagre salaries of public office con-
trast the rewards of endeavor in’in-
dustry‘or“trade or inthe law or medi-
years of 'a public official remember,
that those who teach and preach have
practically a life tenure. As against
the burly burly and generally futile
strife of-‘public life ‘consider the crea-
tive possibilities before the man who‘
devotes this life to extending scientiﬁc
knowledge. , M 1 ‘ .
“It used to be accepted as sound.

‘the last ‘opplortunity to "remind you of
the annual Christmas.-_:‘party of the’
Alumnae which this year is being held
during Christmas week-in the ‘form of

the affair has been helldin the- early
part of January. However somany
-"requests came in -forthedate to be
‘set for Christmas week when Alumnae
are visiting.»-in and near Pittsburgh

that this year, the above change was,

made. . _\.__V _

The party will , be held in Kauf-
man_n’s*dining room on December 30
fromy2:,30— to 5:30. Bridge, five hun-
dred, euchre, ﬂinch, and old maid‘ will
be played. Tables will be reserved
for parties of four and for clubs. Pro-
gression will-be as desired. Those
who ‘come alone will ﬁnd. it “clubby”

to sit at the -. tables which will pro-

Vgress. _ , _
Table hostesses will ﬁnd it con-
venient to serve some of the home-

"made candy which will beon sale. The"

Candy Committee,‘ of which Bertha

v_Kirkpatrick, '15, is chairman, reports

lvthat _candy ,donations may be deliv-

. ered in person or" by parcel post to

her at 5272 South Winebiddle, street,
or into‘ the‘ Alumni oﬂices,‘ or to Miss

Tickets_ma’y-be procured from Mar-:
-garet Ralston, .’1.8, 1318 Reddour
street,’ North Side. »The assessment
-of $1.25 per person is less than what
has of necessitybeen charged for the
luncheon inthe past, and the party
will allow a longer and more sociable
time. In ‘addition there is the’ very
great attraction that the money made

on the affair will be put to good use

‘as part ofthe fund to be l,e-nVt"out to
undergraduates’ asoccasion arises for
incidental expenses. Those who buy
tickets. "even though they know at
the time that they cannot attend are
assured that every cent of that con-
tribution will be added to the‘ fund.
About one-ﬁfth of~’the assessment of
those, attending‘ will go for refresh.-
Vments. In view of all this the.Alum-
nae are urged to use their tickets in

-some_way, preferably in person, and .

if that isnot possible, then to send
a proxy or several pf them.

‘The Student Employment Bu-reau.  ".;'£j'.€—
has quite often in thelpast had op— "
portunities to place -alumni in lucra-
tive employment but, due to the"
scarcity of alumni applications on __ V
ﬁle, has frequently been unable to-_ «? 
ﬁll positions, according to‘ a ''state- 7 ‘
ment issuedcl;-y the bureau. Several _
cases of this character have arisen 
recently and the bureau has appeal.- , ,
ed to the Secr_etary. of the Alumni 
Association to bring the service olig 
the bureau to the" attention of ; Pitt”_'_. '
graduates. -The ‘Employment Bu-
reau, functioning as a part of. the
Department of the Graduate .-Man-n V‘
ager.. of Student Activities, is in -'
chargeof R. R. Mallory and all -in-
quiries should be addressed ;to "
Mallory at Room 104, State Hall. :, n, -A

"For‘ some reason," Mr. Mallory g 
stated to the secretary, “Pitt alumni, ..  ,_.
are not taking full advantage of the K _-'_ 
service ‘ of our Employment Bureau. 
-If the failure of graduates to ‘ask. 
the assistance_orf the bureau means"
that they are sa.tisfa.ctor.ily placed,
we naturally cannot help them. But.

I am sure’ that there-are many for-

 

-mer students who want to better

themselves but who have forgotten

that the same bureauiwhich secured
positionsfor them when they were
students, ‘can still "be of service to
them. Every ‘once in a while ‘ a."
splendid position is allowed to go .. 
begging because Deans, Heads of 1 f,ic,r,
departments and ‘the bureau knowl 
of no alumnus who wants the. place. 
2 “For example, at the present time.
we are in a position to place several‘ 
chemists ‘but have no applications  "
for that ‘kind of_ work, on ﬁle. We

may "not be "a-ble"to secure positions .‘

for all alumni applicants as ‘soon as

their applications are received _ but

feel sure that we can refer some.-_
thing of interest to them-s_ho1'tly_. 

known as the ‘Student’ Employment
Bureau, it desires to be of service
to former as well as active ‘studen‘ts._ V ,-:__«

DENTALPROFESSUR Imas -

Dr. ,‘Ord  Sorber, .Assistant Pro-
fessorof Operative and Clinical Den-
tistry, died suddenly at St. J ohn’s
_Hospital- at ‘6V o'clock Tuesday morn-
ing, December 5th. The ’imm’ediateV
cause -of ‘his’ death is said to have‘.
been angina pectoris, which was sup-
‘erinduced by overwork and a physical
breakdown. following. his experience
"as Army Dental Surgeon in the Philip-
pines 1904 to 1907. ? ._

As a~teacher of operative dentistry
Dr. Sorber was. without a peer. Un-
usually’ skillful as. a technician, he"

 

also a broad-minded“ student and well
versed in the academic and medico-
dental sciences. which form the foun-
dation of modern dental education.
His wide experience in» general prac-
tice, in industrial dentistry, and‘ in
his seven years in ‘the Army Dental
Corps developed in him a resource-
fulness’ in overcoming difficulties and‘
a mastery of technique that were
considered marvelous by :all who had

tions. ’

In addition to his admirable charac-
teristics as student, scliolar, tech-
nician and operator, he possessed to
a remarkable degree the ability to
teach-not only to impart his knowl-
edge to a student, ‘but to develop in
such student “an intense interest in
hiVs work; to recognize the .student’s
‘difficulties and to train’ him-to over-
come them- His particular forte lay
in the -ﬁeld of individual instruction,’
andifor the past ﬁve years his whole
time had been devoted to teaching
juniors -and seniors in sections of from
two to. eight students. V I

Wh_,ile.being a "man of deﬁnite and;

‘uncompromising principles, Dr. Sor-

ber wasso gentle «in manner and kind‘-'
ly in--disposition; so unselﬁh in his ac-
tions, and so willing at all times to be
helpful to those needing help, that
he not only merited =but_l'eceived -the
respect and the love of all Who came__
in intimate contact with him.‘ To the
students who nave worked and studied
with him in his little room in the
in-ﬁrmary building in ‘recent years.
“-Sorber’s' Room” is a hallowedplace.
Dr. Sorber was identiﬁed with the
dental school» since it opened‘in'1896,VV
having been a member oftthe ﬁrstV
class that was matriculated. _
.He was graduated ,in 1898- and
served as a member of the teaching
staff till 1900, when he ‘entered the
Dental Corps of the United States
Army among-the first to take up that
service’. He was stationed iri’.Texas
:Eor,_three years, and then sent to the

"Philippine Islands, remaining ‘inV/‘the. . I
service until 1907,‘ 'when_"he returned '

to Pittsburgh and entered’ ‘into private

practice andagain devoted part time

to instructing .inV..Vthe dental college.
A" few years later he ‘took charge of

venture in _Industrial Dentistry _and
became the dentist. for/the Armstrong
Cork‘ Company «:"of Pittsburgh; "He
spent several years in this; work and
devoted himself so conscientiously and’:
unselﬁshly‘ to it that he suffered a
physical’ breakdown and had to give

0 up practice for about two years, hav- ,

ing recovered ‘somewhat, he returned
to the faculty of the dental ‘school as
a fulltime instructor. -He was elected
Assistant Professor at the close of the
last school year. " e ‘
Among the morethan two thous-
and alumni and students of the Dental
School ‘of the University of. Pitts-.
burgh, -there is not one .who- did not
réspeVc_ti.him, or who does not ‘recog-
nize thathe owes much to this be-
loved teacher. " V » - _ I
What a wonderful life his was—to
have lived‘ and Worked hard. and un-

I Vselﬁshly for the beneﬂtof others and

-without the slighest, compromise of
.prViciplVes,' to have earned the love and
respect of all who knew him,-—and

. what an inspiration it must be to all
_who came within» the circle of his in-

ﬂuence. There will be many saddened.

last Christmas vacation. C
_ Your career after graduation is a question

The Panther swimmers captured
first place at the swimming gala held
at the McKeesnl0rt Y. M. C. A. on
Friday night. The. number of en-

mer, took second honors in this
event. »itt’s second. relay, consist-
ing of Leroy VVilliams, Brodie, Det-
weiler and Homer ‘Butts, captured
first place in the 2,00-yard handicap

themost exciting of the evening» and

.the time was unusually fast.

The Pitt team wi1l__ho1d its first
dual meet’ of the season next Satur-

'7 Ranked High By Critics

 

son for "several.-years, despite the
two defeats that were suffered early
in the season and the mediocre form

, that was displayed in the ﬁrst few

games. These defeats were ‘more
than atoned for by Pitt’s winning
the next six‘ games which included
victories over Pitt’s two biggest
rivals, W. & J. and Penn State, who
both had not been beaten by Pitt in
-one season since 1918. ,

Pitt. is not given the rating of
being the championship eleven of the
East or even the tri-state district
because. of the two defeats at the
hands of Lafayette and VVest Vir-
ginia, but all reliable critics opined
after Thanksgiving Day that there
are very few teams that are now
capable of defeating Pitt. ‘

« The team has played nine. games,
only two of them being with Class
B teams, namely, Cincinnati and
Geneva. The other seven were with
such leading elevens as Penn State,
W. & J., Lafayette, West Virginia,
Syracuse, Bucknell, and Pennsylvania.

Lafayette, who won from Pitt, 7-0,
and West Virginia, who defeated the
Panthers, 9-6, all the games resulted
in victories for the Panther. The
Lafayette defeat was atoned for when
Pittoverwhelmed W. &,J., 19-0, only

won from Lafayette; on the Polo
Grounds iniNew York.__ The West
Virginia defeat was not thrown into
discard as completely as the Lafay-
ette _ defeat, as "no teams that Pitt
met defeated the Mountaineers. The

than made up for the defeats by
West Virginia and Lafayette.

Pitt began the season with material
that was not considered better than
the average. The only regulars from
last year that‘ Coach_-Warner had to
start‘ a hard season with were Jor-
dan, Sack, Clark, Bowser, Holleran,
Anderson and Hewitt. However, add-
ed to these, therccwere several others
from last season's squad, many good
men from_ last year's freshman team
and ‘fFats” Gburley of the 1919 and
1920 teams.‘ ‘Out of all these men it
was felt that Warner would be able
to mold.a‘fair_1y good team.

"At least in the first game, there
seemed to "be the impression that
Pitt would have a ﬁne season. ‘The
opening game with Cincinnati Uni-
versity at Cincinnati was more of a
practice affair, the ﬁnal score being
35-0 in -Pitt’s favor. ‘Everybody but
Captain ‘Tommy Holleran, who was
suifering with a bad leg, received
a chance to play. ‘

But in the next two games, certain
weaknesses seemed to be very appar-
ent- One was a great tendency to
fumble. Another was the failure to
take advantage of breaks, and, last-
ly, the team seemed to lack an open
ﬁeld runner. 4' All these weaknesses
gave promises ‘in the West‘ Virginia
and Lafayette games of making
Pitt’s -season a disastrous one. But
as_ apparent « as these weaknesses
were, one could readily see that Pitt
had strength and that, as soon‘ as
the team could get working smooth-

a degree. of regularity. V
The game with Lafayette lat Forbes
Field was a real heart-breaking af-
fair. Pitt did not show any great
form, but lost only when oneﬁgof Laf-
ayette’s linemen picked up alﬁfumble
and ran 30 yards for a touchdown.
That proved ‘to be the winning play
for Lafayette as they won, 7-0.
