All week long the talk hadbeen
centered around the confrontation
between the Penn» State ground
game and the Pitt defense. That
was to be the key to the game, it
was said. Could Curt Warner and
Booker Moore .move the ball
against Hugh Green and company?

So much for pre-game predic-

What happened in front of
82,459 7 chilled fans at Beaver
Stadium was what winning coach
Jackie Sherrill. described as “A
typical Pitt-Penn State game.”'

Having beaten Penn State for the
second straight time, Sherrill had a
lot to smile about. He almost had
nothing to smile about. If it were
not for the magniﬁcent play of his
stalworth defense, which preserved
a 14-9 lead and win, Sherrill might

1 I Pitt students can have an impact
on the lives of mentally retarded

children. St Peter’s Child Develop-
ment Centers, preschools for men-
tally retarded or developmentally
delayed children, offer students an
opportunity to have experience with
special children.

St. Peter’s serves as a practicum
site for Pitt students who are child
development, special education,
social work, and nursing majors.
Students work as either assistant
trqachers or social workers.
Teacher’s duties include such things
as helping a child walk, respond to
his name, label parts of his body, or
use scissors. Social workers deal
with both the child and his family.
This includes going to the family
home and helping parents with con-
cerns or in developing skills with
their child (such as toileting, eating,
or dressing). '

A child development senior,
Laura Haberman, explained her
practicum experience at St. Peter’s.

“I like the way the workers get
along together, their techniques for
handling kids, and the way they’re
really organized. It’s also very

Students may be placed at any of
six centers located throughout
Allegheny County: Oakland,
Monroeville, Turtle Creek,
Homestead, Baldwin, or Bellevue.
Most students go to the one in
Oakland called the Pittsburgh City
Center located in the University and
City Ministries Building on the cor-
ner of Fifth and Bellefield.

According to Dolly Falkowski,
public relations director for St.
Peter’s, three percent of all children
born in Allegheny County are men-
tally retarded. St. Peter’s serves 150
preschool children annually, ages
two to five.

“Children are- referred to us by
parents or other relatives, doctors,
nurses, or welfare workers,” said
Mary Kay Pahala, development
director for St. Peter’s. “To be
eligible for our program, children
must show ‘a six month delay in a
developmental area (such as walk-
ing or talking). They may be either
mentally retarded or developmen-
tally delayed.

Mental retardation
sometimes be detected at birth.

“For instance, if a child has

injuries, it is known at birth. We

stance, a child may not be learning
to walk or talk when other kids his
age do. We wouldn’t want to give
him the label of mental retardation
right away. He may be a slow
starter,” she said.

Pahala believes it is best to help
delayed children when they are
young. '

“Most rapid growth and develop-
ment of the brain and nervous
system take place before five years
of age,” she said. Much can be
done with early intervention, that
is, “providing programming or

benefit of the patient, and possible
expenses are dicussed, Greene add-
ed. If accepted, a signed consent
form by the patient is given to the
research unit. f‘
The ethical questions that arise
deal directly with the patient.
.“The administration of a drug
which could be potentially harmful
or a surgical procedure that carries
a certain amount of risk are first
discussed,” Greene said.
The grant, which must be renew-

wed every five years, is spent primari-

ly for the salaries of the nursing

  

    

assistance to the child prior to
school.” -

The program at St. Peter’s in-
cludes individual and group ac-
tivities in the following areas:
general movement (lifting head,
crawling, or climbing);
discriminative movement (cutting,
stringing beads); conceptual or
cognition (attending to sound, lear-
ning colors); personal-social
(feeding, paying attention to other
people); and communication (total
communication through sign
language; following directions).

Karl Schliach, center coordinator
for St. Peter’s Pittsburgh City
Center, would like to see more Pitt
involvement in fundraising for St.
Peter’s. '

continued from page one-

Also, the center must pay the
hospital a daily. cost per patient,
thus patients’ hospitalizationis paid
for, Greene added.

Another hospital utilizing a
research center is the Children’s
Hospital. This is a four bed unit
which_ recognizes the different
facilities necessary for the care of
children, Greene said.

“For example, the ffaternities
and sororities raise thousands of
dollars for other needy organiza-

tions but they overlook St. Peter’s '‘
which is in their own back yard,” ‘

Schliach said. “We need money to
make up for our deﬁcit, since costs
are skyrocketing yet funding has
frozen. Transportation costs alone
are $100,000 a year.”

St. Peter’s hires both high school,
and college graduates as assistant,
part-time teachers at a beginning
salary of $3.50 an hour. Speech and‘

full-time teachers, possessing a P‘

Bachelor’s degree, can start
anywhere from $5.00 to $5.25 an
hour. Center coordinators, who
need a master's degree in education,
begin at around $10.00 an hour. -

B Pitt Out Defenses Penn State,14-9    

/Continued from page 1) 1
Lions 'defense helped keep the
Panthers at bay and kept the score
close and the outcome in doubt.
As brilliant as the Penn State
defense was, the Pitt defense was
' better. It was better because,
although it let PSU outgain the . ’
Panthers 257 to 234. it limited the '
Lions to 9 points where they could
have gotten more.
The Penn State defense shut
down the Pitt offense by allowing '
only one second half TD. This - A ‘I

  
  

occurred after a roughing the
kicker penalty on a successful ﬁeld
goal try,. giving the Panthers
another chance. The Pitt defense
had to come up with some clutch
plays deep in its own territory to
avert the loss. In fact, it was not
until the final minute of the game
that the outcome was secured.
- With Pitt leading l4-3 midway
thru the third quarter, Dave Hepler '
shanked a punt deep in his end and ,
the result was a 6-yard punt and
 first and ten for PSU on the Panther
23. From there, the Panther
defense went to work. After 3
plays put the ball on the Pitt 14, Joe
Patemo decided to go for a fourth
and one and inserted tailback Joe
Coles. Coach Sherrill had a good
notion why.
“We knew about Coles and his
option pass and were not surprised _
byczitin t k th ‘t h f  ’ ' T " ‘
oes oo e pic rom fT\—?"/ ._ ,  . . , ‘
. , quarterback Todd Blackledge and ‘_ ,4 _ Q .7;1‘V"'P*.\ I ‘ M’ 1m‘ 5 A 3,“ \ '/ ‘ '
3 i started out as if he were sweeping ‘ ° ‘ .  '_ ‘ V  - .. ' :~  B

DIDHE Just’ SM son/\ETlrl:r\>tr   P
Aeour A uoN sun) Rut: ? '  P A

to the right. With T om Flynn and
Terry White blanketing the State
receivers downﬁeld, Coles had

 ‘ little option but run with the ball.

His plans were nulliﬁed. however,
by a hard charging Hugh Green
who tackled Coles inches short of
the sticks.

Three plays later, Penn State
was threatening again thanks to a

‘Gene Gladys interception. Gladys.

who was named ABC player of the
game along with Jackson, was part

. of a defense that made itself known

in front of a national television

" audience. This time the Penn State

offense was not to be denied as
Blackledge threaded the needle

and hit Kenny Jackson with a
perfect 13-yard toss into the end
zone. Penn State went for two and
Blackledge underthrew a wide
open Jackson and the score
remained 14-9.

Undaunted, the Lions kept
coming on. ,

With Pitt deep in its own
territory after a Ralph Giacomarro
punt was downed on the Pitt
one-yard line, Dan Marino let go of
a 52-yard punter pass. As Jackie
Sherrill later admitted, the long
interception by Marino was as good
as a punt due to the fact that

Hepler was not having a good day. ,

Midway thru the last quarter.
Penn State was’ again faced with a
fourth and one again Patemo
decided to go _wide. Patemo’s
thinking may well have been
influenced by the play of Jerry
Boyarsky, Pitt's middle guard. The
260-pound senior was in the Penn
State backfield all game long
causing havoc among the Lions
players. His presence was a strong
reason why Warner and Moore
only rushed for 39 and 47 yards
respectively. After the game
Boyarsky had nothing but praise
for the Lion offensive line.

“That line is by far the best I’ve

played against all season. When
Jaggers got hiirt Ithought it might
effect them,
stringer was just as good.”
Boyarsky’s presence may well
have dictated Pat_erno’s fate. From

the Pitt 41, Blackledge took the ball.

and started an option right. His

plans were hastened by a blitzing-

Sal Sunseri and the freshman
quarterback pitched early to

Warner. From there the Lion back’

was easy pickings for strong safety
Carlton Williamson who tackled
him for a 4-yard loss.
Williamson’s name would be
called one more time before the day

but the second.

was over. i *

Penn State got the ballone more
time with 2 minutes remainingand
was able to move the ball from its
own 27' to the Pitt 34. From there
Blackliedgelrolled out to pass. With

only 47 seconds remaining a I

sideline pass was in order and
Williamson knew it.- ‘When the
Lion quarterback saw no one open
he ‘threw it out of bounds or tried
to. Blackledge, however, threw it
right into the hands ‘of Williamson
who had anticipated the whole
sequence and with 47 seconds
remaining ﬁnally sealed Pitt's “big
14-9 win.

There Must Be a Better System   Thahihe Bowls  

The Pitt football team and Jackie Sherrill which
have bt th been criticized over the past few years as
“not able to win the big one” did just that ‘Friday in
that crucial 14-9 victory over Penn State.

While Pitt did lose earlier in the season to Florida
State, the Panthers have not yet been beaten, as such,
"but have only beat themselves.‘ Twenty of Florida
State's 36 points came as a direct result of Pitt tur-

’ novers in that 36-22'Panther loss. -
Friday, the Pitt defense was awesomegin holding

4 the Lions to just a field goal and a touchdown. On

_ two straight possessions, Penn State was driving and

 faced with a fourth and short situation. On both oc-

casions, the Panther defense rose to shut the Lions
down and gain possession of the ball.
4 Barring the loss to Florida State, Pitt would now
be ranked number one in the nation and headed for
‘either the Orange or Sugar Bowl. Instead, the Pan-
thers are on their way to a meeting with a South

4 ‘V a Carolina team which is 8-3, unranked and losers of
_. an embarrassing game with Clemson. Penn State, on

‘_the other hand, is on its way to the Fiesta Bowl to
' face Ohio State. Again, there is no justice.

between Florida State (whichmust face. arch-rival
Florida next week) and a two-time loser, Oklahoma.
.In the Sugar Bowl, undefeated ‘Georgia’ will face
Notre Dame; The Irish are 9-0-1 , -but. must still play

two games will make up a national doubleheader on
ABC_ Saturday and the outcomes could send Pitt
soaring into the number two ranking in the country.

That is, [F Florida beats FSU. and [F USC beats 
Notre Dame. Although those two look like two big '

lF’s, stranger things have happened in the world of
college football during this bizarre season. In fact,

both USC and Florida are coming off big losses, -’

USC to cross-town rival UCLA and Florida to cross-
state rival Miami. And Florida and USC are two
teams which don’t like to lose, and rarely do do two

   
   

Out Of Bounds

By Jeff Durosko

' 
What this all means is that if both FSU and Notre

Dame lose, Pitt will go into the Gator bowl ranked _

,second, with the second best record in thecountry.
Perhaps the bowl ‘officials will take along look at the
election dates and consider moving the date back and
wait until the final game has been played. T

Although this would help the situation, it is not the

solution to the problem. The only way to resolve the?‘ "

Dwight Collins Big Addition-to PittOHense g

By MARK VEATER

The Pill News Staff Writer

Dwight Collins continues to
stretch his remarkable talents in
football to the playing field at Pitt.
An outstanding running back and
track star from nearby Aliquippa,
Collins is a lethal weapon in the
offensive strategy employed here
at Pitt. f

Going into the big rival game
against Penn State last Friday,
Collins had caught 36 passes for

his credit. -

A blue chip prospect on his
graduation from Aliquippa, Collins
was swamped by recruiters to play
football. He came to Pitt because
he wanted to be close to home and
friends. The image of Collins at
Pitt with his great running abilities
and track record had reminders of
another Tony Dorsett. Through the
fall practices, Collins was prepar-

~ ing himself as a runningback in the

offensive formations. The football
season at Pitt opened with set
backs to their two ﬂankers going
down to injuries. (Larry Simms and
Barry Compton). A major change
in the offense became apparent due
to the injuries. V

The following week before
practice, Collins was asked by the
coaches about the possibility of
switching to the ﬂanker position.

The decision to play end was left
up to me alone,” said Collins. “I
was asked before practice that day.

I went over to the receivers group
to work on the basic pass patterns
during practice. Once I got the
routes down, the rest fell into
place.”

During the remainder of the
season, Collins has surpassed all
the problems of transition with his
spectacular catches and runs. With
the speed of his moves, opposing
teams have had a rough time
catching him.

“Most of the defensive backsrun
about a 4.6 in the forty,” he added,
“while I run a 4.3 forty. This
enables me to get beyond the
defenders.” Whether Dan Marino
or Rick Trocano is throwing the
ball, it doesn’t matter to Collins.

.“It makes no difference to me
who is throwing the football,” he
said.

Many teams have employed
double teaming Collins and trying
to slow him down at the line of
scrimmage.

Against Army, Collins said

“they used six defensive backs.

plus two linebackers to try and slow
down the pass routes we were
running.” '

Both Collins and Willie Collier'

caught touchdowns passes in the
45-7 Panther win.

Reflecting on the team unity of
the offense and defense, Collins
noted “the offense took longer to

be united as strong as the defense,-

but as the season went on, the‘
whole team became very close.

‘the sky.

He added “the controversy
between the quarterbacks is mainly
brought by the outside. There is no
problem.”

Collins comes from a sports
family. His father played baseball
with the Atlanta Braves organiza-
tion, while his older brother is up in
Canada playing football for the
Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canada
Football -League; .

“It was kind of a must to be
playing sports in the family," he
said. “I played since I was in grade
school.” b

He played in four sports before
coming to Pitt (basketball, football,
track and baseball). ‘

The career of Dwight Collins is
unlimited at Pitt. He can‘become

the record breaker in every

receiving department at Pitt during
his stay here. With a remarkable

" freshman year so far, Collins can

continue to carry on the great list of
football players that attended Pitt
for years to come. The only limit to
Dwight Collins’ career in football is
