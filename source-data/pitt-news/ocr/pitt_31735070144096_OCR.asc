WASHINGTON —— Sen. Ba-
rack Hussein Obama was elected
the 44th president of the United
States on Tuesday, swept to vic-
tory by an anxious country eager
to change course at home and
abroad.

Obatna, 47, becomes the first .
black person in U.S. history to win
the presidency and the first from
the generation that came of age
after the turbulence of the 1960s.
He built his campaign on a mas-
tery of the Internet as an organiz-
ing tool that will change the way
presidential campaigns are run
forever. His biracial background .
reﬂects the changing demograph-
ics of America in the 21st century.
And his victories in formerly Re-
publican states in the South, lVIid—
west and West reﬂect a changing
political order in the making.

After a drawn-out struggle,
the ﬁrst—term Democratic senator
from Illinois defeated Republican
John McCain, 72, a hero of the
Vietnam War and a four—term
senator from Arizona.

Obama was at the vanguard
of Democratic gains across the
country that promised him a
solid working majority in both the

House of Representatives and the

Senate.

Democratic challengers ousted

Republican incumbent Sens. Eliza-

beth Dole in North Carolina and
John Sununu in New Hampshire.
Democrats also picked up open
Republican Senate seats in New
Mexico and Virginia.

However, they failed to oust
Senate Republican Leader Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, appar-
ently dashing their hopes of gain-
ing a filibuster-proof 60 votes in
the Senate. _

Eager for a popular mandate
to reshape the government,
Obama appeared well on his way
late Tuesday night to become the
first Democrat to take a majority
of the popular vote since Jimmy
Carter eked out 50.1 percent in
1976. H

Obama sealed  victory by
holding all the states thatrwent

Democratic in 2004, then picking '

off Republican states including
Iowa, New Mexico and Ohio.

Ohio was particularly irnpor- _
tant: No Republican has ever won
the presidency without Ohio. No
Democrat had won the White
House without it since John Ken-
nedy. V '

There, as everywhere, the

cal landscape solidly against the
Republicans as the party of power
—— and responsibility —— in the

' \White House. .

Interest was intense.

More than 40 million Ameri-
cans already had voted by Tuesday
morning, and total turnout was
expected to top 130 million. The
turnout rate was likely to rival the
modern record of 67 percent set
in 1960, the highest since women
were granted the right to vote in
1 920.

The Democratic wins came
at a moment of history when the
country was unusually anxious, as
eight years of a Republican presi-
dency are ending with an economy
sinking into recession, markets in
turmoil and U.S. troops at war in
Afghanistan and Iraq.

President Bush, whose popu-
larity plummeted following his

‘close re-election four years ago,

was all but invisible Tuesday,
shunned on the campaign trail and
watching the returns in the seclu-

sion of the W/hite House.

He voted earlier by absentee
ballot in Texas, where he expects
to move after leaving office on
Jan. 20.

Bush loomed large over the
election as both Obama and Mc-
Cain vowed to change course.

From the start, Obama ran
on the promise of change, both

‘in policy and political style. Un-

known outside Chicago just four
yearsago, he seized the national
stage with a keynote speech to
the 2004 Democratic National
Convention that gave voice to a
hunger for a lessconfrontational
and divisive politics.

That appealed particularly
to a new generation of young
Americans, drawn into politics
in large numbers, who helped

Obama defeat New York Sen. Hil-

lary Clinton for the Democratic
nomination in a 50—state marathon

that pitted his promise of change

against her offer of experience.

McCain, too, promised change.

He urged voters, particularly In-
dependents, to consider his long
tradition of maverick reform that
often challenged his own party.

A “I am not President Bush,” he

insisted.

But it was all but impossible
for McCain to shake the Bush
legacy — a burden made worse

Oakland voters turn out,

9,.

by Angela Reno
Staﬂ Writer

Voters at on-campus precincts voted
overwhelmingly in favor of Sen. Barack
Obama yesterday.

According to election ofﬁcials, at both
the Soldiers & Sailors and Posvar precincts,
Obama led Sen. John McCain three—to—one,
with 3,343 to 1,076 votes.

Politicians visiting the polls, including
state Rep. Dan Frankel, D—Allegheny, said
they were impressed with the turnout. Fran-
kel reminisced about the 1998 election in
which he ran. Precinct 8, which encompass-

‘ es Litchﬁeld Towers, was the largest in the

state, and only two people voted, he said.

Yesterday’s turnout was “unprecedented.
[I’ve] never seen intensity, and excitement
like there was this year,” said Frankel. 1

The voter turnout was up everywhere in
Oakland, despite the fact that the lines, like
those in many other places throughout the
country, were sometimes hours long.

More than 2,800 people, many of them
students living on Pitt’s campus, voted at
Soldiers & Sailors yesterday.

At any time after 11 a.m. more than 200
students could be found waiting to vote at
one of Soldiers and Sailors’ eight polling
machines.

Some students who arrived at Soldiers &
Sailors between noon and 1 p.m. said they
waited in line for two to three hours.

After learning she was only halfway to the
polls despite already having waited in line for
more than one hour, senior Mary O’Brien
said, “I didn’t know I was only half way
there .. . I would have probably tried to have
left and come back if I had a busier day.”

“[But] our futures are on the line,” said
O’Brien, adding that “a lot is going to change
with whatever candidate gets elected.”

Last-minute voters stand in two-hour
lines

The last Pitt student at Soldiers & Sailors
precinct, freshman Doug Thomas, voted at
9:50 p.m. yesterday, after a nearly two—hour
wait in line.

Thomas and his A friend sophomore.
Harry Schrnitt ran to the polls from Suther-
land Hall, arriving only minutes before they
closed at 8 p.m. T

“I registered in“ Allegheny County rather
than D.C., which is where I’m.from, so that
made it more important for me to vote 
so now I feel like my vote counts more,” said
Thomas.

“Every vote counts and I want to vote in
my ﬁrst election,” he added, after several ma-
jor news networks had already given Penn-
sylvania’s electoral votes to Obama.

Both Thomas and Schrnitt said they re-
membered gpast elections,»where the states
were called early and then later overturned
as the last results came in. J

The two talked about the importance of
the election and echoed the overwhelming
View that voters on both sides of the aisle
wanted a change no matter who won.

“We deﬁnitely need some kind of a
change for sure,” said Schrnitt, “with the
way the economy is today, with the war. We
deﬁnitely need change  we deﬁnitely need
something.”

Students encourage students to vote

Students turned out yesterday to do more
than just to vote.

Some came tovolunteer with Election
Protection, a nonpartisan initiative that en-
courages groups to work together to make
sure students vote on Election Day.

Groups involved with Election Protec-
tion included Black Action Society, Campus
Women’s Organization, College Democrats,
College Republicans,.Rainbow Alliance and
the Student Vote Coalition.

Krystal Mitchell ‘of Election Protection
said the polls were “crazy” iﬁrst thing this
morning, but that the campus organizations
worked together to help straighten out the
issues. .

The main issues that students faced, aside
from the long lines, were ﬁnding their cor-
rect precinct, getting rides to those precincts
and  out provisional ballots, if neces-

sary. . »

‘voters in Soldiers & Sailors last night.

1 He thanked them for coming out to vote

» as they waited in line to cast their ballots.

“It was great to see the college students
here in line and thank them . .. for going to
vote, and then ﬁnding out that [for] so many
of them, this is their first general election
they’re voting in,” said Harris.

“When I was in college, I didn’t vote. It
was the furthest thing from my mind,” he

. added. “That’s wonderful to see that they’re

getting involved and that they’re gutting it
out there  this is about their future and

I’m so glad to see that they realize that 
Hopefully this will be something they will do
for the rest of their life.” I
Harris said that what he thought the
country needed to see the most yesterday
was a sign of 
“We need a capable leader who surrounds

Professor: Obama needs

to gain Congress' trust

Honeymoon, page 1

After the inauguration, however, presidential
power should be at its height for Obama, based
on historical evidence of a phenomenon referred
to as _the “presidential honeymoon.” For the first
six to 12 months of Obama’s presidency, he will
experience   levels of cooperation
from  to match what should prove to be
especially high approval ratings-

There is a catch, though. \X/hile Obama’s ap-
proval ratings might be  of a newly
won election, a newly inducted president is also a
naive president;

Krause explains this “tension of the president’ ’
as the idea that presidents are “most inﬂuential
when they walk in, but least capable of govern-
ing because they’re new to the job and they don’t
know whatit entails” .

Yet as the president gains experience as head
of the state, his political inﬂuence decreases

According to Krause, the key to Obama’s early
success is to work with his counterparts in Con-
gress to deal with the economic crisis

“The economy is pethaps the most important
factor. A bad economy will weaken the president
in the eyes of Congress,” said Kmuse “Bush’s
economy has slowed and affected his approval
ratings The economyis the strongest predictorwe
have of whether people approve or disapprove of
a presidents performance.”

History professor Laurence Glasco agrees
that the econornywill be Obama’s and the nation’s
toughest challenge and said that the remedy will
not come 

“People are  to have to adjust their life-
styles, and that’s not popular . . . there’s goingto be
some serious pain,” said Glasco.

He added that it is unfortunate that the cam-
paigns did not educate the public about the sacri-
ﬁces thatneedtobemade,likesignificantcutsin
borrowing and changes in taxes and 

Adding more to Obama’s load is the idea that
the Democrats anticipate  the brunt of

the challenge

MUST BE 21. PROPER LD. REQUIRED

As a Democratic president facing a Demo-
craticCong1ess, Obamaisexpectedtzodeliver
a certain level of consistency to the legislative
branch. If he fails to deliver the  
Congress members will feel less of an obligation
to the president, and his honeymoon  will
be shortened, said Krause.

A specialist in race and ethnicity, Glasco said
Obarna’s -presidential honeymoon will also be
determined in large part by the black intellectual

community \While it has so far refrained from ~

pressuring Obarna for an agenda to cater to black
people, Glasco said the intellectual community
will be less patient than the general black public
for Obarna to formalize his support of the nu-
notity race.

But Obama simply cannot take that stand and
be an eiiective president, said Glasco.

“It’s very nerve—racking to think about,” said
Glasco “A lot of whites are nervous about a black
president. Thefre concemed with how they will
be treated by a black president, whether there will
 be any sort of revenge for history.”

A better route would be to advocate more
directly for the  class, which would then
help a large portion of the black community,
Glasco said. .

He added that the fact that Obama has won
support across the nation’s diverse racial and eth-
nic backgrounds shows that Americans are work-
ing to overcome their prejudices

“We need ablack presidentto showhe canbe
president of all the people, to transcend race as
we’ve asked whites to do,” said Glasco

Because of this, Glasco added, Obarnawill be

, limited in his appointments and might even have

less of an opportunity than Bush did to place in-
ﬂuential blacks in his cabinet

H Obama’s mostirnmediate pressure could come

McCain, campaign
proud of their efforts

Election, page 2

when Vice President Dick Cheney decided
to issue a public endorsement of McCain
on the ﬁnal pre-election weekend. It was
the subject of one of the ﬁnal ads of the
campaign —— aired not by a proud McCain,
but by Obama.

' Flying home to Phoenix on Tuesday
afternoon, McCain and his aides sounded a
sentimental note about the campaign.

“We’ve had a great ride, a great experi-
ence, and it’s full of memories that we will
always treasure,” said McCain as he spoke
with reporters on his plane.

McCain’s chief campaign strategist, Steve
Schmidt, later told reporters that McCain
was already facing a hostile political land-
scape as the face of the Republican Party
when \Wall Street collapsed in September
and voters grew even angrier.

“We did our absolute best in this cam-
paign in really difﬁcult circumstances,” said
Schmidt.

“We did the best we can in historically
difﬂcult circumstances from a political cli-
mate. It is highly doubtful that anyone will

Doyle trounced Pitt profeeaor, Green Party cczrzdidate N ort/.7

by Lindsay Carroll
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

The Democrats watching the
election results in the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
Union in the South Side went crazy
as CNN called -Pennsylvania for Ba-
rack Obama last night.

But as Rep. Mike Doyle of Penn-
sylvania’s 14th district circulated
through the crowd of local politi-
cians and union workers, he was not

. Watching the numbers for his own

reelection. Doyle felt secure about

winning his race against Pitt profes-
sor and Green Party candidate Titus

A North.

A mile down East Carson Street

in the offbeat, green seclusion of
The Beehive Coffeehouse, North
sat with a group of supporters and
a radio to get updates on the election
results.

North ended the night with 8.6
percent of the dist3ict’s vote —— about
21,000 votes, compared to Doyle’s
227,000.

North was not expecting to win
the election. He’d run for the same
congressional seat two years before
and for mayor in 2005.

He said one of his objectives was
to make room for other  on
the ballot.

‘We have the forum of democra-
cy, but we don’t have the substance,”

he said. “If I don’t do this now, then
the person who comes after me is
going to have a hard time. To a cer-
tain extent, I’m trailblazing here”

North took an active stance
against Doyle about the corporate
bailout, which Doyle supported. Al-
though he got some press coverage
for it, he said that wasn’t enough.

“Not having the money means
that the press writes me off from the
beginning,” said North.

Back on Hot Metal Street, Doyle
said that he didn’t think North’s po-
sition at Pitt would affect how stu-
dents voted.

“I think people vote on issues,”
he said. “I think his support will

come from people who agree with
the Green Pa.rty’s platform.”

Doyle said that he wasn’t worried
about losing the election because
North only got 10 percent of the
vote in 2006.

“I like him personally, and I have
respect for him,” said Doyle “I’ve
engaged in debates with him. My
way of campaigning doesn’t change
depending on who I’m 
against”

Nicole Kubiczki, a Duquesne
student who gathered petitions for
Doyle’s campaign, said that she was
impressed by Doyle

“He really debunked my views
about politicians — I was expecting

him to be staun ,” she said. ‘There
area lot of Democrats that have
been unopposed for so long be-
cause they’ve done such a good job.
They’ve put a face on politics, rather
than just  a flyer.” I

Kubiczki said she didn’t know
North was‘ on the ballot;

Pitt professor Patrick Altdorfer,
North’s colleague in the political
science department, said that even
though the Green Party wouldn’t
win, he thought North could have
made a good representative.

“[North] is engaged in the issues,’ "
said Altdorfer. ‘The Green Party

.doesn’t have a chance in a two—party
system, so it was kind of hopeless.”

Obama victorious but st

has along road ahead

After more than two years,
millions of dollars and endless
hours of campaign coverage,
commercials, punditry and non-
sense, the presidential election
has ﬁnally come to a close. And
with the necessary 270 elec-
toral votes, Barack Obama won
Pennsylvania and the presiden-
tial election.

But that’s only the beginning.
When Obama takes ofﬁce in

. January, he’ll have ahead of him

some of the toughest political
challenges a new president has

i faced in recent history.

With a failing economy, an
ongoing foreign war and the
challenge of his own lack of
experience in Washington to

‘surmount, Obama needs to
start his programs and policies
as soon as he gets into ofﬁce
to have a chance of healing the‘
country’s wounds during the
next four years.

The ﬁrst and most important
act he will perform will be to
choose his cabinet, and it would
be wise of him to pick people
who can help him compensate
for his own limited experience.

It would also be refreshing
for him to choose members
across party lines and ideologies
— it’s rarely beneﬁcial to only
‘have people who agree with
you to be your advisers. Obama
needs to be as open to discus-
sion as he has been during his
campaign, as this will be key to
forming his administration.

Also, it’s important for
Obama to start detailing his
plans for social and internation-
al policies. With Congress ﬁrmly

‘in the hands of the Democrats,
Obama shouldn’t have a hard
time passing new legislation and
enacting his policies. But that
doesn’t mean he can afford to
let them wait. .

Even though he’s tried to
outline clearly how his tax poli-
cies and health care package will
work, it’s important that he puts
them into legislative motion

quickly so they can be seen and
understood in ﬁnal form. .

The same goes for his policy
in the Middle East. Obama has
been notably noncomrnittal on
a deﬁnite plan for dealing with
Iraq, so developing one and
putting it into motion should
be an immediate goal of his ad-
ministration.

It’s also important that he
clarify his plans for the war in
Afghanistan, given how vocal
he was on the subject during
the debates with Sen. John Mc-
Cain.

It’s clear that Obama intends
to change Washington and the
policies and procedures of
the Bush administration. But
people have to remember" that
even though he has been hailed
as a vanguard of change by his
supporters, he still has to work
within the traditional constraints
of the system that his predeces-
sors did before.

It’s impossible for him to
immediately ﬁx all the prob-
lems plaguing the United States.
While Obama has a mantra of
change, changes take time to
enact and settle in. It’s simply
not possible for everything to
be ﬁxed right after he takes of-
ﬁce. Supporters have earned
the right to be excited, but we
all need to be patient, too.

But that only means that the
first few months of his term are
even more important than they
are usually. While an incumbent
president has the luxury of con-
tinuing his programs from the
last ‘term, Obama has no such
ability.

Instead, he must work as
hard and as quickly as possible
to bring about the social and
political reform that he prom-
ised, at the risk of seeming inef-
fective if he does not.

Obarna’s race to the W/hite
House might be over, but now
it’s up to him to see how the rest
of his presidential legacy will be
realized.

The Giles Files

Bush not done with Iraq policy yet  

by Giles Howard 

Colummlit

 

 We’ve ignored a lot as a nation

over the past year as we focused
on the tantalizing soap opera
that was our presidential election
instead of national and world
events as a whole.

But even though we as a peo-
ple were engrossed in the daily
controversies of campaign life
doesn’t mean that things weren’t

 happening both at home and
i abroad to which we should have

been paying attention. Just be-

, cause we no longer think about
 President Bush or see him on

television doesn’t mean that he
and his administration are no
longer making decisions that
could —— and often do —— have
disastrous consequences for our
nation and the rest of the world.

For instance, while the presi-
dential candidates have been
talking about Iraq, Bush’s gov-
ernment has been taking action
there. The latest Bush initiative
is to negotiate a status of forces
agreement with the Iraqi govern-
ment.

Such an agreement is neces-
sary to maintain the presence of
U.S. forces in Iraq legally. The
U.N. resolution that, since 2003,
has provided the legal basis for
military operations in Iraq ex-
pires on Dec. 31, and thus the
American government needs to
negotiate a deal to allow our mili-
tary to stay there past that dead-
line.

Without this agreement" or a
new U.N. resolution, U.S. forces
will essentially be forced to cease
combat operations in Iraq. This

wouldn’t be a problem if the ne-
gotiations over the agreement
were going well, but in keeping

with the administration’s dis- _

mal foreign policy record, they
aren’t.

A major sticking point is that
the government of Iraq wants to
be able to prosecute U.S. military
personnel in Iraqi courts. It also
wants to stop the U.S. military
from staging cross-border raids
from Iraqi territory, along with
the ability to open and read U.S.
mail. And it wants to call the ﬁ-
nal document “Agreement on
Complete U.S. Withdrawal from
Iraq.”

The Iraqis have even been so
bold as to demand that the revi-
sions in the Arabic version match
those in the English one.

To me it sounds as though
the Iraqi government is attempt-
ing to assert its sovereignty and
safeguard its interests as a func-
tioning nation-state.

Even though these sound like
sensible demands for an inde-
pendent nation to make‘ toward
an occupying army that, at least
we’re told, is there to help them,
the Bush administration says that
the demands “cross red lines.”

Rather than continue to nego-
tiate with the Iraqi government,
the Wasliington Times reported
that the Bush administration
is considering approaching the
U.N. Security Council for an
extension of the current resolu-
tion authorizing the U.S. military
presence in Iraq.

If the Bush administration

chooses to do this and bypass’

the Iraqi government, it will re-
veal the American rhetoric of
the past ﬁve years about spread-

ing freedom and democracy and
supporting the formation of a
sovereign Iraqi nation as empty
and meaningless. '

By making‘ the demands list-
ed above, the Iraqi government
demonstrated that it ﬁnally has
the best interest of its citizens at
heart. It proves that Iraq’s gov-
ernment will no longer function
as a puppet of the United States
government and that it is ready
to take an active role in the lVlid-
dle East as a sovereign nation.

We should respect these de-
mands as a sign that Iraq is com-
ing into its own as a nation, and
until we withdraw our troops at a
deadline of the Iraqis’ choosing,
we should abide by their laws.

Ignoring the laws of Iraq and
turning it into a staging ground
for cross-border raids against
Iran and Syria is not the way you
treat an ally; it’s the way you treat
a colonial possession. The Iraqi
government knows that it has
not been treated as an equal over
the past ﬁve years. Iraqis recog-
nize that their sovereignty has
not been respected and that their
wishes have been consistently ig-
nored.

If Bush wishes to salvage any
part of his Iraq policy before he
leaves ofﬁce in three months, he
must renegotiate the agreement
with the Iraqi government rather
than go over their heads to the
U.N. Security Council.

What he does now will affect
how easy it is to extricate our-
selves from Iraq in the coming
years and what sort of relation-
ship the Iraqis will have with us
once we’re gone.

l\/Iichael McDonald: That’s right, and
by the way, if Wikipedia says it happened 
it happened. That’s like the new Bible.

TPN: You were in some episodes of

“Scrubs” and “Seinfeld,” a few “Austin A

Powers” movies, and you’re also credited in
“Leprechaun 2.” How did you get involved
in irnprov comedy and random bits of tele-
vision and movies? I

MM: Basically, I was a loan officer at a

1 bank — I hated it. And there was this local
V: improvisational comedy at this place called

The Groundlings in L.A.,  I saw Julia
Sweeney and Lisa Kudrow, people like that
performing. I thought that that was what I
wanted to do. And I quit my job and on that
Friday  and then I became a waiter and
worked my way to Groundlings and then

 got on stage there, and that’s when people

around town started giving me a chance to
do shows.

TPN: After irnprov you went on to

MADtv and worked on it for about 10 years.
What was it like being on that show for that
long?

MM: Well, it was excellent to get a pay-
check. For the most part, it was really great
because last year was my last year perform-
ing on the show. I just kind of wanted to
move on and do some new stuff. After 10
years it felt like that was enough time. What’s
great about a show like MADtv is the cast
gradually changes, and because pop culture
changes and presidents change or whatever,
you get a lot of new stuff to do, so it keeps
it from being boring. I think if I was on a
sitcom for that long, I might’ve killed myself.
It was a really,‘ really fun phase. I also viewed
it a little like school — I kind of learned how
to do a lot of things there. I never had really
done impressions before that, and you have
to do everything there, so it’s almost like an
acting school. I had a great time there [and]
made a lot of great friends, and I look for-
ward to working with people again.

TPN: So you’re writing and directing
now for the show?

M: I direct sometimes on the show. I
haven’t written anything this season, but I
actually have a new project for one of the
networks. I wrote a drama pilot, and I’m try-
ing to trick them into shooting it now.

TPN: Do you want to elaborate on your
new show?

MM: Well, it’s top secret, so all I can say

Pittsburgh punk band comes home from Calif.

Nov. 8

Club Cafe
41 2-431 4950

Leaving the pristine weath-
er of California for the harsh
winds and slush of Pittsburgh
hardly seems logical to anyone
from the West Coast, but Mc-

Kees Rocks native Christian
Dines has no qualms about re-
turning home.

“I absolutely love this place,”
said_Dines. “Pittsburgh is one
of the few places left with re-
gionalism and character in the
country.”

Dines, aka “The Inevitable
Mr. Chris,” will play with his
band Firethorn after a short
solo return last March. This

return marks the first time in

four years that the prominent
Cali-rock group will perform in
Pittsburgh.

Firethorn’s first attempt at
a Pittsburgh performance re-
sulted in “a total train wreck,”
according to Dines._

Everything that could have
gone wrong did —— a drummer
on parole, a bass player who
didn’t know the songs, an empty

house and an unfortunate stom-
ach strain inc-urred by Dines.

“When you’re in college, it is
hard to find people with enough
dedication,” said Dines.

This time around, Firethorn
is a completely different band
with the addition of bassist
Sean Myott and drummer Ha-
bieb Fakhoury.

Firethorn, whose name is
derived from the street Dines

grew up on, is an‘alternative-
punk band under the influence
of bands like Fugazi and the
Dead Kennedys.

Firethorn most recently
dropped its debut album Pollu-
tion for the Fountain of Youth
and is on a whirlwind tour of
the Northeast to promote it."

The band was able to put
the album together, thanks to a
friend’s connection with a for-

Variety is the spice of life, so it’s not all
homage tothe Beatles. “(Get Off Your)
High Horse Lady” takes a decidedly dif-
ferent approach to the rock genre, bring-
ing in a series of stomps and claps and a
twahgy acoustic sound. The sliding vocals
on the chorus with that resounding “Lay
down” turn this western-inspired song
into a hit-worthy track.

Bringing in the classic rock sound is
“Bag It Up,” which shows that the elec-
tric guitar still has a place with Oasis. The
chorus has a bit of a strange but appeal-
ing quality, sounding simultaneously like
the Vines and Lenny Kravitz. So, its use
of the word “hee-bee-jee-bees” is no less
manly and rock ’n’ roll. ._

Instead of an overbearing ’60s inﬂu-

Apple didn’t think this was satisfactory,
however. A few months after I bought my
laptop — for about $400 off its normal
price, thanks to Apple cuts and Pitt’s dis-
count generosity — Apple turned out a new
MacBook. '

The new MacBook is somehow envi-
ronmentally friendly. For those who com-

monly throw out their old computers, the i

prefer the new MacBook. It comes com-
plete with a touch pad that appears not to
be a touch pad. It is  integrated into
the case of the machine — none of this
delineated area to put your ﬁngers for con-
trol nonsense. _

The touch pad has gestures, allowing
for better ﬂexibility in computer control.
Although this is a good addition to the
machine, I prefer clicking. I’ll save the ges-
tures for when the machine locks up.

guably the wave of the future.

a good deal of foresight.

do not have the
capacity to fol-
low the tonal
nuances and
subtle instru-
mentals of a
band, they lack
musical compre-
hension. They do
not have the full ability to enjoy or
despise what they are listening to.
The band and self—titled debut album
Women falls into this inauspicious category.
If Women were placed into a speciﬁc
musical genre, it would have to be some
form of indie rock. '
At times the album is wonderfully me-
lodic and folksy, almost comparable to The
Shins.
However, Women is bogged down by

   
 

A several tracks that are

confusing sometimes

One good aspect this song introduces is
infectious, repetitive hooks that dance play-
fully throughout some of the better tracks.

“Black Rice,” a standout composition,
spins with radical, seemingly unrelated lyr-
ics, “On *a bleak Monday morning / Hold

‘my head / Everything tastes right / Perma-

nent daylight.”

While verbal understanding does not
exist, the pleasurable sound of church-like
bells and a repeated, simplistic guitar hook
keep the listener entertained.

A mixture of psychedelic folk rock and
popular indie guitar licks, “Black Rice” pre-
vents the album from getting a swift toss
out a window.

Sitting in the No. 4 spot, the track sin-
gle—handedly allows the listening to con-
tinue after the jumbled mess created by the
album’s starting tracks.

After “Black Rice,” Women starts to pick
up the pace with a series of considerably’

"more melodic and hummable tunes. Dis-

sonance still plays a major part in these
later endeavors, but the introduction of
unpleasant sounds act as a buffer to the

abundance of jovial interludes.

Arguably the most annoying song ever
written, “\X/oodbine” is a discordant blend
of broken wind chimes and apprehension,
as nothing happens for more than three
minutes.

The song is like the musical tension right
before Jason Voorhees slays a camp coun-
selor, but the killing never happens.—

Like “\X/oodbine,” the opening track
festers with jarring noises, static and overall
absence of melody. “Cameras” does have
singing, although it sounds like someone
mumbling into a long pipe.

The dual transition brings about “Shak-

ing Hand.” While the repetitive guitar ’

hooks linger, there is a significant amount
of drum work taking place.

Featuring the most polished and mu-
sical composition on the entire album,
“Shaking Hand” is comparable to classic
Sonic Youth while retaining a marvelous
uniqueness.

As an unusual but classic indie album ,

from another indie band, Women might get‘
a little lost in translation, but fans of the
genre should check it out.

is that it’s a drama and it’s for ABC. It’s actu-
ally a lot easier working drama than comedy
because all you do is just say this happened
and that happened. You don’t have to be
funny-

TPN: Do you ever wish that MADtv
was more like Saturday Night Live, or that
you were on Saturday Night Live? '

MM: Well I think SNL is a really great
show, and I have many friends on it, so I

‘ guess it’s an awesome opportunity. Obvious-

ly it’s. much more high profile than MADtv
is. But I’m a firm believer that things hap-
pen the way they do for a reason, and one
of the great things about MADtv for me is
that some of my very, very best friends that
I have in the world were made while work-
ing on MADtv. So you know, who knows?

November 5, 2008

Maybe if I’d gotten on SNL  I might’ve
bombed out and gone back home and quit.
In the meantime I went to MADtv and
made a lot of friends and had a nice long
10-year run, so I’m sort of loathe to cast a
stink eye on that because it’s been really nice.
But I do think SNL is a great show and ﬁlled
with really talented people.

TPN: Any ﬁnal thoughts?

MM: I don’t really tell jokes, so a lot of
the characters that I did on MADtv were
based on people I knew in real life and situ-
ations that happened to me in real life, and

that’s kind of what my stand-up is, too. It _

talks about real things that happened to me,
and hopefully, in a ﬁinny way. \We’ll have a
great time, and it might be a little dirty, and
we’re just going to have a bunch of laughs.

Firethorn, pa.ge8
mer recording engineer. ,

“The album is a lot of our early stuff,”
said Dines. “You have to get that first re-
cord out and start building a strong foun-
dation.”

“A Looker Named Lexi” exempli-
ﬁes the group’s satisfying sound and is a
standout fan favorite.

\Wild and fun, the song is reminiscent
of the feel-good tune “Beer” by Reel Big
Fish. _

.Available for listening on the band’s
MySpace page, the song received nearly
3000 hits.

-“That song is about one of my life-
long friends,” said Dines. “It’s about a
crazy one-night stand he had but can’t.re—

' ally remember.”

While promoting its album is a major
factor in Firethorn’s return to the east,
Dines has his own reasons for the home-
coming.

.Dines moved to San Diego in 2005 to
pursue a solo career after the initial for-
mation of Firethorn collapsed. The alter-

native singer and guitarist looks to bring
his California inﬂuences home.

“It’s a matter of vindication,” said
Dines. “I’m glad to be here. Hopefully, I
won’t get too many ‘boos.”’

“[In Pittsburgh] it was always hard to A

ﬁnd those who understood what I want-
ed to do musically,” said Dines. “Now
it’s like I am picking up from where I
left off. I still live here; I’m just gone for
months.” p .
With a schedule in California that

"mostly consists of working, playing and

trying to book shows, Dines shows no
signs of stopping as Firethorn looks to
extend its fame to the opposite coast af-
ter tearing up the Golden State with more
than 100 shows in the last two years.

“There comes a point when it is no
longer about sacrifice,” reflected Dines,
“because it’s fun.” I

Firethorn will play the late show at
Club Cafe on Saturday at 10 p.m. on the
South Side, featuring local openers The
Strangles.

Steelers fans still willing to 11 allt

by Tony J ovenitti
Staﬁ’ [Writer

People were huddled under bridg-
es on the North Shore,  to stop
the gusting wind from stealing their
belongings The stench of spilled beer
and greasy food wafted over dozens
of people using crevices in the old
retaining walls as bathrooms This
would be a depressing sight any other
day. But not on this sunny Sunday af-
tCI‘I100ﬂ.

This was Steelers Sunday on the
North Shore, where tens of thou-
sands of people invaded the 
lots around the stadium and under
Interstate-279. Music blasted at such
high decibels from so many different
vehicles that songs blended together,
creating an entirely new genre Beer
pong tables spilled out ﬁ:om the backs
of SUVs, and cornhole game boards
covered what little pavement was left,

creating an obstacle course for anyone
trying to walk 

Larry West, a husky, middle-aged
man, sucked on an Art Rooney—in-
spired  as  wife, Julie, munched
on a sub while sitting on the bumper
of their SUV West explained how
he’d been attending Steelers games
since the 1970s — the giory days for
the Steelers His wife, though, wasn’t
the same.

“I only come when the weather is
fair,” she said, laughing. “I don’t like
when it’s cold or when they lose”

Weeks after one of the worst fi-
nancial collapses in the nation’s his-
tory, neaiiy 65,000 people gathered
at Heinz Field to prepare for 21 mar-
quee rnatchup between the Steelers
and the reigning Super Bowl champs,
the New York Giants. It was obvious
that the Wests, among others, weren’t
about to give up game day to save

some cash

“It’s hard to cut back on  to
games and buying stuff for our kids,”
said Mr. West; “I guess you just have
to suck it up.”

The Wests said that while theyfre
tryingtocutbackonspendingas
much as possible, theyfre not 
to sacriﬁce much. Still, they make
sure not to waste money on the little
things 1

“Why do you think I’m eating in
the car?” asked Mrs. West; “It’s ridicu-
lously expensive [inside the stadium] .”

“I’m eating inside,” replied her

I husband.

His wife shot him a glance and
said that there would be no way he
could spend that kind of money in
the game

But inside the stadium, along with
the  food, there was more
than just a football game It wasn’t just

While Pitt’s win over Notte Dame
in quadruple overtime gave Pitt some-
thing to boast about, fans can’t help
but wonder when starting quarterback

i"Bi1lStullwi]lreturntoaction.

Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt told
reporters after the Notre Dame game
that Stull would return this coming Sat-
urday against Louisville but said earlier
thisweekinapress conference thathe

_ can’t guarantee anything

‘Tm sure everyone is anticipating

and anxious to know about Billy,” said
Wannstedt “He has been deared.”
But Wannstedt said St11ll’s reda-
mation, performance and conﬁdence

mine whether he plays against Louis-
ville
Stull missed the Notre Dame game
because of a concussion he suffered
duting Pitt’s loss to Rutgers on Oct 25.
Stull said yesterday that he will play Sat-
urday, but Wannstedt was still unsure
“If he was healthy enough to play,
and he thought that, and the doctors

thought that — then he would have
played,” said Wannstedt .

Wirming at home

This season Pittis 4-0 on the road,
with notable wins against South Floti-
da, Navy and Notre Dame. The Pan-
ther losses, both to underdog teams,
were played at home on Heinz Field.

“You have to look at each game
individually,” said Wannstedt “We

of the season. The Rutgers loss, how-
ever, came after Pitt regained a national
making

[Looking at the Rutgers game alone,
there was nothing sharp about the
Panthers’ performance. In fact in the
last four years, Pitt hasn’t pulled out a

Rutgers, Pitt under Wannsmdt hasn’t
beaten Louisville, either.

Whattoexpect
With a conference game against

not sure

Louisville this Saturday, the Panthers
are in a prime position to exercise their
dominance in the Big East

“We’re eight games in, andwehave
four games left,” said Wannstedt “Ev—
erybody is playing conference games
now, and every week is a big week
They don’t get any easier.”

Louisville will be a challenge for
Pitt,  on defense. Weaknesses
in the secondary exposed Pitt in the
Rutgers game, and Wannstedt said it
could be costly for the Panthers if ad-
justments aren’t made

If Stull is out and sophomore Pat Bostick takes
thereins,it’lllikelyrnakeanappearanceagain.That’s
because with Bostick in, Pitt doesn’t have a ton of
options through the air:

Bostick tossed three interceptions on Saturday in
relief of Stull. He banded back and tossed a game-
tying touchdown to jonathan Baldwin but is still
inconsistent:

If Stull can’t go and Bostick starts, look for a lot

allgame

Defensively, it will be  as well. While
the defense has guys like Scott McKillop andjabaal
Sheard  well, it’s still allowing 27 points per
game and isn’t causing nearly enough turnovers

Because McKil1op, a senior, has never beaten
Louisville, he’s looking to ﬁnally do it in  last
chance

“We’ve had two letdowns this year,” said MCK-
illop “We’te looking forward to getting back on

Fans save by cuttingback on tailgating

Steelers, page l3

a matchup of two football teams. It was a con-
test between a city whose major economic base
— Wall Street —-— sat on the brink of disaster
while the other’s —-— Pitmburghs steel industry
—-— had fallen a long time ago.

James Kenkel, an economics professor at.

Pitt, explained how. the housing sector “is kind

P of what screwed everything up” and how Pitts-

burgh is  affected less than other cities

“The housing industry of Pittsburgh doesn’t
drive Pittsburgh like it drives a state like Colo-
rado,” said Kenkel. “[It’s] just like when the steel
industry collapsed. It had abig impact on Penn-
sylvania. The house lending collapse impacts
New York and areas that are booming in house
construction, like Denver” ’

The people of Pittsburgh might not have
been affected directly by the mortgage ﬁasco,
but they have suffered from higher gas prices in
recent years, which have caused some people to
cut back. Mr. West said he drives to work Down-
town every day, and he said the cost of fuel is
taking a large chunk out of his paycheck.

Mrs West is noticing it, too.

“I’ve noticed it around the tailgates,” she said.
“Before, everyone would bring bottles of beer.
But now most people just drink cans”

Kenkel believes cutting back on spending
will only hinder the economy more.

“In recessions, politicians need to tell people,
‘Ifyoucan,gobuyaTV,gobuyareﬁigerator,
go buy a car,”’ he said. “Then-this helps create
more jobs.” ,

Kenkel said this was the reason for the stim-
ulus package last summer; If people.don’t spend
money, he said, jobs are lost, and the economy
worsens — _

“We’re not getting people to work by saying,
‘Don’t buy anything,” he said.

Still, Kenkel said buying tickets to a football
game in Pittsburgh isn’t  to help create
more jobs, because those jobs are already in a

- stable industry.

But buying cases of Iron City for the  _
and eating Primanti’s sandwiches at the games
will help keep those industries alive in the city.
While some can afford to spend their money,

there will always be people who simply can’r af— '
ford to spend and help create jobs. Politicians
frequently speak about a shrinking middle class
—-— the idea that the middle class is  poorer
while the rich get richer. Kenkel said he doesn’t
agree with this notion.

“Most politicians are horrible economists

They don’t even define what the middle class is,” i

he said. “And they don’t realize that an uneven
distribution of income is normal.” ,

He added that most people’s income fluctu-
ates throughout their life.

While the Wests aren’t  up any football,

another avid  Phillip Simons, said he

eventually might have to. Sirnons, who works in
a bank in southeastern Ohio, has season tickets
toPit1sburghgamesanddn'vesanhouranda
half for each game

“It becomes harder and harder to come up
with the money to pay for the tickets each year,”
he “said. “The price of gas isn’t helping much,
either.”

He said in past years he came early to tailgate,
butnowheis tryingto cutbackonexpenses and
now eats fast food on his way home after the

games.-

“I hate  a game, but I might have to "1’

able to afford  them,” he said..

Kenkel, however, insisted that people need
to spend money if they ever want this country
to escape recession.

“By all means, spend more,” he said.

For those like Sirnons and the Wests, it’s not
so clear—cut. But theyfre deﬁnitely trying

“I would love to be able to come to every
game and host elaborate tailgates,” said Sirnons.
“But it’s just not practical anymore”
