EBook sales
lukewarm
...?;:::;;:::‘.::

After a lackluster sales performance last
semester in the University Book Center,
eBooks are slowly becoming more popular
at Pitt. The Book Center has sold 100 more
electronic books this semester than it had
at this point last semester, manager Debra
Fyock said. But Fyock noted that, despite
this increase, the electronic form still counts
for less than 1 percent of the total books,
both new and used, purchased so far during
the spring term. -

The low sale levels come even as electric
readers become more popular among tech-
savvy and green—minded consumers, and
the meager ﬁgures represent a potential
difficulty for the Book Center to address as
it seeks to redeﬁne its image and services
on campus.

Still, Fyock is conﬁdent that eBook sales '

will increase as more students learn about
the option over time.

“I would have to say that [eBooks] have
not really caught on yet,” Fyock said. “But I
do think that students are more aware that
the Book Center offers this option.”

‘ EBooks have been available in the Book
Center since the start‘ of last semester. The
digital books work through a code that stu-
dents can buy from the book store and use
to download the text onto a computer.

The eBooks offered at the Book Center
arealso currently compatible with iPads
and iPhones, but not with Kindles or Nooks,
other popular electronic readers.

The store’s inventory of digital books is
supplied primarily through textbook pro-
vider Coursesmart, which offers 90 percent
of all core textbooks used" in higher educa-
tion today, according to its website.

Molly Stieber — a strongadvocate for bring-
ing eBooks to campus — said it might be too

Councﬂ
plans for
pension 1
fund

Tegan Hanlon
Stajf Writer

This year, students might feel the effects of the

city’s pension-ﬁmding plan —- at least when
they park on the street. A

City Council waits on Mayor Luke Raven-
stahl to sign off on a parking meter increase
that would remedy budget losses due to pen-
sion funding. Council dedicated a portion of
the parking tax, $13.4 million,.to increase
pension ﬁmding levels to above 60 percent.
To make up for this money loss to the budget,
Council has proposed an increase in meter
prices. The actual amount that meters could

-potentially increase will not be set until the

plan is ﬁnalized.
Councilman Bill Peduto and budget direc-

C‘ _tor Bill Urbanic made the armouncement dur-

ing Tuesday’s Council meeting. They outlined
where the city is ﬁnancially and how they plan
to achieve long—term stability. A ‘

“The purpose of the meeting was to show

that the city can get bywithout the meter in- .

crease, but barely,” Peduto said.
Urbanic said that the increase in potential

* parking—related fees through a Parking Au-
thority payment would be $1.3 million in 2011 PT

and $8 million between 2012 and 2015.

- The increase has been passed by Council
and has the support of the City Controller, but
the plan next needs the approval of the mayor’s
ofﬁce, Peduto said.

The mayor’s office did not respond to
several calls for comment over the past three
days.

In their presentation to the Council, Peduto
and Urbanic emphasized how the city could
— balance funding debt and pension. .

and 2017 during which balancing the budget
and pension" solution could get difficult.

“During these six years we have additional
payments into the pension plan, but our debt
payments are about the same,” he said. “These
are the years where it will be a challenge to
meet revenue projection and have the money
to do the capital budget.” -

For 31 years, aportion from the city’s park-
ingtaxwillbe dedicated to the pension fund in
order to increase levels to 60 percent.

Under Pennsylvania Act 205, the city was
required to ﬁmd more than 50 percent of its
pension by the end of 2010. Late last year,

the fund was only about 30 percent funded,
and it took a last-minute rush and veto over-
ride by Council to push through a plan that
dedicated 31 years of parking tax revenues to
the pension fund. . d

If the state government had taken over the
city’s pension, it would have meant increased,
mandatory contributions from the city that
could have resulted in service cuts and tax
increases for city residents. A report from the
Pennsylvania Municipal Retirement System

— which manages most municipal pensions '

in the state — estimated that contributions to
the pension ﬁind might have reached a quarter

Parking revenueto helpwith city’s reserve fund

of the city’s budget in that situation.

Pittsburgh is one of a few municipalities in .
Pennsylvania that manages its own fund. Most
of the municipal pension funds are run by the E
state’s retirement system. p

g The current planwill exceed the 50-percent
threshold and also meet the annual $80 mil-
lion in beneﬁts the city pays out.

“We will still have money to ﬁx roads, buy
equipment, preserve our parks and keep rec-
reation centers opened,” Peduto said.

‘ The city covered the.$13¢million budget
gap for this year using reserve funds, explained

I «Councilman Patrick Dowd.

k

“We may not needthe parking revenue for
this year since we have a general fund that has
a sufficient number of dollars,’iDowd said. “But
we need to make sure use of that fund does not
continue and we think the mayor can negotiate
a rework of funds.” ‘ i 1

Dowd assured the public that there will
be no budget shortfalls in the future because
of the plan. V '

“Typically we haven’t had budget short-'
falls,” Urbanic said. “We’ve made our budget

truly reﬂect student interest in the alterna-
tive textbooks. She cited the large number
of students who wait to purchase their text-
books until after the add/drop period as a
possible explanation for the small purchase
percentage eBooks represent.

They’ve found out whether the professor
is actually going to use the book, or they’ve
decided to stay enrolled in the class, she
said.

Butjohn Burns, textbook manager for the
Book Center, hasn’t seen a surge of purchases
after that date in the past.

In general, most of the purchasing is done
before the add/drop period ends, he said.

Stieber said students’ increasing tendency
to buy books from other places beside the
Book Center might also account for the low
percentage of eBook sales.

“We need to see more traffic in the Book a

Center,” she said. “Pitt students should want

to support our Book Center. The store is here

for students.”
Junior Gina Zidek agreed with Stieber.
“I only trust the Book Center,” she said,

blaming her aversion to outside book sell- .

ers on a bad experience with an online re-
tailer. ,
But while the Book Center comes with a

i promise of integrity for some, other students
' are wary of the cost.

Christina McDonald’s parents advised
her to get the ISBN numbers of the books
she had to buy in order to get them online.
The sophomore biology major said she saved
about $100, calling the Book Center “over—
priced.” She said she didn’t purchase any
eBooks. g I

Stieber believes more students entering
the bookstore will lead to more students
coming across eBooks and consequently
purchasing the alternative textbooks.

“This is the future,” Stieber said. “EBooks
are the future.” a

The Book Center worked in conjunction
with Stieber to form a student advisory com-
mittee last semester. The group of students
was created to suggest ways the Book Center
might attract students and get the word out
about new offerings, including eBooks. The
store crafted a plan in the fall to increase
eBook sales by providing a larger selection
of the books. This semester, the store offered
210 more textbook titles than last semester.
Despite theseefforts, student response re-
mains mixed. ’ I I

Yash Patel, one student who opted to g
digital, is happy with his decision. Patel be-
gan buying eBooks last year. He estimates
that he’s saved $200 since that time through
his digital textbook purchases. . A

“I can pretty much get all the books I need
for my classes,” said Patel, an information
sciences major. '

Lower pricing is the principle beneﬁt as-
sociated with eBooks. Fyock said that, on
average, the digital books cost 40 percent
less than their paper counterparts.

Students who favor eBooks also said they

appreciate their mobility. One laptop or iPad
can easily hold the weight of an entire back-
pack’s worth of books.

In the paper camp stands freshman
Jake Schwartz, who said he hesitated to
buy eBooks for a reason common among
students: “I really have no idea how to use
them.” V

Schwartz also said the fact that his pro-
fessors haven’t mentioned anything in class
about digital alternatives inﬂuenced his
choice to go for the paper option. I

since 2004. We always had a positive operat-
ing result.”

The balance between debt payoff and '

money toward pensions can be done without
signiﬁcant tax increase or signiﬁcant cuts in
the ﬁmds the city receives, Urbanic said.

Urbanic described the city’s current annual
debt payoff plan as a “cliff,” meaning that the
amount the city pays will drop signiﬁcantly
after about a decade.

“We owe $87 million until 2017. We pay that
until 2017 and by 2018 it goes down a little bit
and then by 2019 the payments go down a lot.

In 2024, the debt will be paid off completely,”
he said. “In the years later is when we will put
more money into the pension.”

Once the debt payoff goes down, the pay-
ment to the pension fund will double to $26
million. A

Peduto remained hopeﬁil about Pittsburgh’s
ﬁnances.

“We need to make sure that we under-
stand that there is an opportunity here, an
opporttmity to use what we have done in the
past month to move towards ﬁnancial future,”
Peduto said. I

LETTER to nu: Eniton
To the Editor,

Imagine my surprise when I opened The Pitt News yesterday and read Leah

Trimble’s column, “Can’t spell ménage a trois? You can still have one.” I
was delighted to hear that Ms. Trimble believes college to be a “free pass
for bypassing moral code.” When I enrolled at Pitt, I was hoping to gain
an education and experience that would help me in the “real world.” The
last time I checked, a moral code still exists among 9_—to—5 jobs,

mortgages and heartburn medication.

However, Ms. Trimble appears to be living in an alternate reality in which

anything goes! I look forward to reading additional articles in which she
navigates this delightful, moral-free world. I suggest she continue by
informing us on how to cheat on our signiﬁcant other and hook up with
underage students. After all, what is college all about?

A Sincerely,

“being proud of accomplish-

expected that no one would ask
me what I wanted to be when

I realized I was starting to ask

Being on the cusp of graduat-

the fact that I could still hide in

worrying about our ability to
form lasting relationships. The
“isolation” part comes from fear
of rejection and pain. Basically,
Erikson says that if we cannot

cause of our own needs or our
inability to like ourselves, we
feel a sense of isolation. _

;

Drue Heinz winner probes strange behavior

Ryan McGinnis
Staff‘ Writer

Mother-daughter relationships, bi-
sexuality, the intersection of drugs
and parenting, road trips, America

‘ -these are just a few of the things

that fascinate Shannon Cain, this
year’s winner of the prestigious
Drue Heinz Literature'Prize. '

“The questions we’re most
interested in, we can’t help them
from coming out in our work if
we’re being true to ourselves,” said
Cain, whose short story collection,
“The Necessity of Certain Behav-
iors,” willbe published this fall by
the University of Pittsburgh Press,
the prize’s sponsor.

“I’m really interested in situa-
tions in which people behave in an
extreme way, whether in order to
survive or just to experience their
own joy or to relieve their pain,”
she said‘. -

Cain’s ﬁction centers on such‘
v behavior. For example, sh_e sum-

marized her collection’s title story
as follows: “I have a character who

goes on an ecotourism trip and

ﬁnds a village in the mountains
of a foreign country where people
practice a culturally mandated
form of bisexual non-monogamy.
She likes it, and she stays.”
Another story dramatizes the
results of an incident in which a

mayor.’s wife is caught pl‘easur— _

ing herself in the steam room of a
YMCA. As Cain put it, this charac-
ter is “tired of public life and of her
marriage in a way she can’t really
articulate, so she acts out.”

Alice Mattison, the judge who
selected Cain’s collection froma
poolof nine ﬁnal entries, praised

her writing’s unpredictability, lik-

ening it to Grace Paley’s.'

“There’s something of the
same  willingness to go where
the material leads you, whether
that’s where someone might con-
ventionally think you would go or
not,” Mattison said.

Cain is interested not just in the
psychology of illicit behavior, but
in its social dimension: “There’s

‘ an intersection of social awareness

and social commentary around the
illicit — around people who either
break the rules or don’t understand
or acknowledge them in the ﬁrst

place.”

Indeed, Cain welcomes political
readings of her work. In graduate
school, she studied political ﬁc-
tion, and she has a history as an
activist. '

“Feminism attracted my atten-
tion from a young age. I always
found ways to agitate for equality
and social change around women’s
issues. When I was living in New,
York, before writing seriously, I di-
rected-a women’s health nonproﬁt
organization in East Harlem. I was
involved with activist groups that
did traditional street activism and
street theatre.”

Mattison said Cain’s feminist

. sensibilities wereanother selling

point for her.
“You see a lot of stories about

women overcome by unrequited -

love and all kinds of other bad
things,”’,Mattison said. “I loved
reading about strong women -— I
thought that was just grea .”

. Though she now coaches aspir-
ing writers and edits manuscripts,
Cain’s interest in the relationship
between art and politics has never
wavered: “I think art has a huge
role to play in helping us change
the world. The artist reﬂects back
our experience and helps us see
ourselves in a different way. She
opens minds and expands percep-
tion.”

At the same time, Cain strives
“to avoid making a lesson” of her
work, or, conversely, “to make the
lessons so integral that they be-
come invisible.” I

“My goal is to create a story that
can spark people’s imaginations
around broader social issues with-
out moralizing,” she continued.
“Whether a piece of work sets out
to have a social message or not,
it succeeds if it opens our hearts,
and in that way all art is political.
If literature is doing its job, it’s
challenging the status-quo on some
level -- even on the tiniest level of

A detail,” she said. .

Another key issue that Cain ad-
dresses is the development of small
cities like Tucson, Ariz., where she
is currently the artist-in-residence
of Ward 1.’ Reiterating her love of
road trips, Cain voiced distress
over the increasing homogeneity
of the American landscape.

“I think, more and more in

this country, regions are becom-
ing ﬂattened and dulled with the
commodification of America.
Everywhere you go, the cities are
starting to look the same. I’m very
interested in what that looks like
when you have three people driving
across the country.”

Cain ﬁnds 'I‘ucson’s rich identity
so compelling that she has spent
the last ﬁve years writing a novel
set there. But this doesn’t mean
questions of a broader national
character disinterest her.

“I like to live in the space be-
tween ‘regional’ and ‘American.’
I deﬁnitely identify as a South-

western writer, but I identify just‘

as strongly as an American writer.
I hope to provide a snapshot of the
issues that the whole country is
facing around development.”

Though her work hasn’t trav-

eled the straightest path to the
praise she now enjoys, the Drue
Heinz prize has demonstrated that
her preoccupations havefound an
audience in spite of increasingly
long odds. ‘ '
“Every year we receive more
and more submissions and we
hear from more and more authors
wanting know whether the [Drue
Heinz] winner has been selected,”
Maria Sticco, publicist at the Uni.-
versity of Pittsburgh Press, said.

Courtesy Sarah Prall

Sticco added that she believes an
Internet—inspired, do—it-yourself
mentality has led to a rise in ﬁction
submissions across the board.

As someone all too familiar
with rejection herself, Cain said
the prize couldn’t be more vindi-
cating.

“I’m ﬂabbergasted with hap-
piness. I’ve experienced a huge
amount of rejection for these sto-
ries — more than 200 rejection
letters over the years. So to have
this collection be recognized by
the Heinz prize is hugely reward-
ing considering the perseverance
and humility it’s taken to get these
stories out into the world.” I

BOOK COLUMN

Books used to explain insanity

Literary tastes supposedly serve to unpack assassins’ psychology

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

The American media has always overana-
lyzed assassins, assigning monumental

signiﬁcance to theirevery quirk and habit. .
It’s one way the public tries to make sense

of shocking tragedies — after all, mental
illness, when it erupts into murder, is fright-

ening, and it-inspires asnatural. desireto .

comprehend the unknown. ’

Assassins’ bookshelves have been par-
ticularly scrutinized,—'e‘ver since Mark Da-
vid Chapman cited  obsession with “The
Catcher in the Rye” as a key reason for his
shooting John Lennon‘ in 1980. Indeed,
Salinger’s most famous novel would later
be named as an inﬂuence for both Robert
John Bardo, stalker and murderer of actress
Rebecca Schaeffer, and would-be Reagan
assassinjohn HinckleyJr., and gain a sort of
notoriety as the perennial Murderers’ Book
Club Pick of the Month. .

V Now that we live in the age of social net-
working — when peoples’ interests are eas-
ily available on online proﬁles — it should
come as no surprise that much is being made
of the books named “favorites” on Myspace

and<YouTube byjared Loughner, who fatally ‘

shot six and ‘wounded 14 others, including
Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, in Tucson, Ariz.,
onjan. 8.  -
The 22-year-old Loughner, a diag osed
‘schizophrenic who supposedly became ob-

sessed with Giffords after speaking with her »

at atown hall meeting in 2007, listed “Mein
Kampf,” “The Communist Manifesto,” Ayn
Rand’s “We the Living” and George Orwell’s

“Animal Farm” among his favorite reads, as ‘

well as several children’s classics like “The
Phantom Tollbooth” and “Peter Pan.”

Conservatives cite Loughner’s interest’
‘ in Marx as proof that he is a leftist fanatic.

Liberals point to his love of Ayn_Rand as
evidence that he is a right-winger. Feminist
blogger Sady Doyle suggests that his simul-
taneous devotion to both texts — presum-
ing that he fancied himself in agreement
with both — indicates that Loughner was
“stupid.” '

Salon.com’s Laura Miller is more chari-
table, arguing that “Loughner’s book list is
also consistent with a bright, curious, rebel-
lious teenager whose life has been arrested
and derailed by [schizophrenia]” and that
“it is likely that what attracted him to ‘Mein
Kampf’ and ‘The Communist Manifesto’ was
 their aura of the forbidden, the sensation

that he was defying the adults around him

by daring to read either one. The rest of his
favorites — ‘One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s
Nest,’ ‘Brave New World’ and ‘Fahrenheit
451’ — depict deceitful and oppressive re-
gimes committed to squelching individual

initiative and thought .. . a young man [with
paranoid schizophrenia] probably would
favor’ literature in which maverick truth-
tellers are labeled as insane or criminal by
self-serving- authority ﬁgures.” .

Of course, a more interesting question
than whether Loughner’s favorite books
demonstrate liberalism, conservatism, stu-

' pidity or insanity is whether Loughner’s
favorite books — or anyon.e.’s.,.for that mat-.

ter e prove anything at all. ’ .
v “Scanning a ‘favorites’ list to get a sense
of whether you want to know somebody

' is a much-‘derided but instinctive skill of

my generation,’-’ argues Doyle, who links
this necessity to the rise of online dating,
where one often has to read between the
lines of a person’s proﬁle in order to deter-
mine whether someone is worth messaging
or meeting in person.

Despite usingjared Loughner’s favorite

‘books to conﬁrm her diagnosis of mental
’ illness, Miller comes down hard on pundits

that she feels are making too much of his
preferences. “By studying Loughner’s book
list for clues to what ‘drove’ him to commit

' murder, commentators are behaving a lot

like crazy people. themselves. Paranoids are
prone to scouring newspaper articles and
the monologues of late—night comedians

for imaginary coded messages that conﬁrm ‘

their ‘secret knowledge’ about the world. But

those coded messages aren’t there —- it’s just"

random stuff with no special signiﬁcance.”

However, ‘D oyle might be right in saying R

that judging people by their favorites lists is
something my generation takes forgranted.
I surveyed a handful of college students,
recommended to me by my friends as be-
ing well—read, and most agreed that what a

‘ person reads — and especially what a per-

son wants people to know he reads '— says
something about him. ’

Alex Weiss, a friend of a friend at Syra- :

cuse University, believes that peoples’ fa-
vorite characters shape their personalities.
“People tend to live vicariously through their
favorite characters,” he says, “and as they
read more and mo re, they sometimes adapt
these characters’ quirks and habits as their
own, at least to some extent.”

Whether your choice of reading material
shapes your personalityor whether your per-
sonality determines which books you enjoy
is a chicken—or-the-egg debate, but one thing
is clear: Although most people doubt that
the books listed as “favorites” on Myspace
can serve as indications that somebody is
capable of murder, many people our age do
believe that there are insights to be gleaned
from a person’s reading list. Undoubtedly,
listing “Mein Kampf” as a personal favorite
can bejust as damning — if not more so —— as
those pictures from Friday night’s party. _,

MEN'S BASKETBALL

 

Pitt returns home to take on Seton Hall

The Panthers will look to keep a newly returned Jeremy Hazell under control

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

Seton Hall senior guard Jeremy
Hazell has had a run of bad luck
this season. _

Hazell broke his nonshooting

wrist in the Pirates’ third game_

of the year, an 83-78 victory over
Alabama. Then, on the day after

/Christmas, he suffered a gunshot
iiround when he ﬂed from a man
trying to rob him. Head coach
Kevin Willard said there was a
good chance he wouldn’t play at
all this season.

Hazell’s bad fortune off the
court ampliﬁed Seton Hall’s strug-
gles on it. The Pirates —- missing
their leading scorer —— dropped
below .500 and fell close to the
bottom of the Big East.

But when Seton Hall (8-9, 2-3
Big East) visits the Petersen Events

cﬁenter Saturday at 7 p.m. to take '
on No.15 Pitt (16-1, 4-0 Big East), ’

Hazell will be back.

The preseason All—Big East se-
lection came back from his injuries
Wednesday night at DePaul and
wasted no time returning to form,
leading all players with 23 points
and doing it in 30 minutes off the
bench. The Pirates won, 78-67. '

“We are extremely happy with
the decision that Jeremy and

(his family made to‘ return to the
court this season,” Willard said in

a-statement before Wednesday’s .

game. “He has meant so much to

the Seton Hall community over

the last four years. We’re looking

forward to having him back in uni-
:form tonigh .”

Hazell could have redshirted
and returnedto Seton Hall for a
ﬁfth season. ' -

Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon
said that Hazell’s return to the

cﬂoor changes the make—up of Seton
Hall’s team.

“With Hazell brought back and
playing again, that’s really going to
be the biggest change and adjust-
ment that we’ll see, and we only
have one game to go by with him

"being back,” Dixon said. “But we
know him and his tendencies and
what he’s done. We knows his char-
acteristics from over the years.”

In his 13-game_absence, for-
wards Jeff Robinson and Herb
Pope stepped up their games in the
paint. Robinson scored in double-
digits in all but two games, and
Pope pulled down 20 rebounds in
a 61-56 loss to No. 4 Syracuse last

' week.

Pope also had a serious health
scare recently. The Aliquippa,
Pa., native collapsed and stopped
breathing after an April workout.
He underwent surgery to correct a
birth defect in his heart — and lost

40'.pounds during his hospital stay
— but returned to start in Seton
Hall’s season—opener Nov. 12.

The 6—foot-8 junior is third in
the Big East in rebounding.

Pitt, meanwhile, has been cruis-
ing through its Big East schedule,
earning an undefeated record and
a tie for ﬁrst place in the confer-
ence with No. 4 Syracuse and No.
7 Villanova.

The Panthers encountered
no problem offensively against

Georgetown Wednesday night

repeat against the Pirates.

and center Gary McGhee said the
team’s offense has excelledlately.
“We’ve been moving the ball
well and getting good shots and
open looks so that’s been really
helping us out a lot,” he said.

Ashton Gibbs’ performance‘

was the highlight of Pitt’s offen-

-sive game on Wednesday. The ju-

nior guard made three consecutive
3-point attempts in a 2:27 span in
the ﬁrst half and ﬁnished with a
team—high 22 points.

At the other end of the court,‘

the Panthers stymied Georgetown’s
guards from the perimeter. On Sat-
urday, Hazell and the Pirates will
have to do what the Hoyas’ Chris
' Wright, Jason Clark and Austin
Freeman could not: get hot from
‘deep against astingy defense.‘
“[The Panthers] are avery good
defensive team,” Georgetown head
coachJoh‘n Thompson III said af-
ter the game. “There’s no secret
about that.” A
Seton Hall’s perimeter shooting
suffered tremendously without Ha-
zell directing the offense. By tip-
off against DePaul on'Wednesday,

the Pirates had fallen to last in the 7

Big East in ﬁeld-goal percentage
and to third from last in 3-point
shooting. .
Freshman Fuquan Edwin wel-
“ corned himself to college with 10
points per game on average, but
that didn’t prevent the Pirates
from losing the three Big East
games before Hazell’s return.

Snow foreshadowed Seton
Hall’s arrival again this year, as
forecasts called for up to six inches
of snow this week. Last February,
6,681 fans traveled through heavy
snow to attend an 83-58 Pitt vic-
tory over the Pirates at the Pete.

Pitt held Hazell, then averag-
ing 23,points per game, to just one
basket. Pitt guard Travon Woodall
reﬂected on the defense the Pan-
thers played’ against Hazell last
season. ~

“Try to make him put the ball
on the ﬂoor and make his shots
difficult,” Woodall said. “We just
want to get out and bother him a
little bit.”

The Pirates won that season’s
ﬁrst matchup, however, as the Pan-
thers fell 64-61. That’s a game Pitt
remembers well and is part of the
reason why the Panthers won’t
be looking ahead to the matchup
with No. 4 Syracuse on Monday,
McGhee said.

A “That’s ‘something that we do
a really good job of, not getting
ahead of ourselves,” he said. “Last

year, Seton Hall beat us, so I feel , _

like we deﬁnitely owe them some-

thing.” *

FOOTBALL‘

Dustin Gabler
Stajf Writer

Before Dave Wannstedt roamed
the sidelines of Heinz Field, the
former Pitt head football coach
won a Super Bowl as the defensive
coordinator for the Dallas Cow-
boys and served time as the head
coach for both; the Chicago Bears
and the Miami Dolphins.

A Now, following his resigna-

'tion “under pressure” from Pitt,
’Wannstedt is looking for his next‘

career move. Based on the amount
of interest Wannstedt’s been gar-
nering from the NFL, he could be
heading back to the pros.
Wannstedt decided not to coach
Pitt in the BBVA Compass Bowl.
Instead, he watched the team
compete from his home in Florida,
according to interim head coach
Phil Bennet. With an offer already
on the table from Pitt Athletic Di-
rector Steve Pederson to become

“special assistant to the athletic '

director,” Wannstedt reportedly
now has new job opportunities to
consider.

If the interest in the NFL open-
ings is mutual, it appears that
Wannstedt might not accept Peder-
son’s offer and will take a job with
one of the four teams reportedly
showing interest in the Panthers’

-ground on the defensive side of

the ball, and would likely turn the
defense over to Wannstedt.
Chargers head coach Norv
Turner was the offensive coordi-
nator for the Dallas Cowboys from

tie to Wannstedt’s NFL coaching
career. Rivera ﬁnished his play-
ing career as a defensive back dur-
ing Wannstedt’s ﬁrst year as head
coach for the Bears.

Wannstedt served as the Bears’

The Chargers, Panthers, Browns and Bills have

all been reported to be interested in   

Wannstedt as their defensive coordinator.

former coach. 3 I -I I

A The San-Diego Chargers, Caro- T

lina Panthers, Cleveland:Browns
and Buffalo Bills have all been
reported to be interested in hir-
ing Wannstedt as their defensive
coordinator. _

"The Chargers will be replacing
their defensive coordinator,ARon
Rivera, after he left to take the head
coaching job in Carolina. The San
Diego opening ‘could be appealing
gtowannstedt because the Chargers

head coach,does,n’t have a_ back-

1991-93. Wannstedt was the defen-
sive coordinator for the Cowboys
from 1989-92, helping to turn the
team from a 1-15 squad into a Super
Bowl winner.

Wannstedt was named the
NFL Assistant Coach of the Year
in 1990. In 1992, with the league’s
youngest defense, the Cowboys led
the NFL in total defense by allow-
ing only 245.7 yards per game, on
average. , _

Rivera, the newly named Caro-
lina head coach, provides another

head coach from 1993-1998, com-
piling a 41-57 record.

The Carolina Panthers appear
to be the frontrunners to hire
Wannstedt. _ ,

Also in talks with Wannstedt
will be the Buﬁ'alo Bills — and head
coach Chan Gailey has his own con-

-nectionsto Wannstedt.

Gailey just completed his ﬁrst

' season as Bills head coach and was

the offensive coordinator for the
Miami Dolphins when Wannstedt
was the head coach. ’

9,-

Wannstedt’s next move could be to the NFL 1,

Wannstedt was named the head
coach of the Dolphins in 2000 af-
ter serving as a defensive coordi-
nator and assistant head coach.
He resigned halfway through the
2004 season withthe Dolphins’
record at 1-8.

The interesting aspect of
Wannstedt’s possible hire in Buf-
falo is that it appears George Ed-
wards will continue as the Bills
defensive coordinator.

The only open position on the
defensive side of the ball for the

- Bills is as inside linebackers coach.

This element of the Bills’ search
seemingly rules out Wannstedt
in Buffalo, but it is possible that
Gailey will create a special title in
order to persuade Wannstedt to
join his staff. .

The Cleveland Browns have also
been linked to Wannstedt, but the
Browns just named former St. Louis

' offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur

as head coach. Wannstedt has no
connection to Shurmur through
his coaching history, so a posi-
tion with the Chargers, Panthers
or Bills seems more likely. I

Get ready for a big week in the Big East, ’

everyone. Exciting games are the norm for

the best conference in college basketball —— _

whew, it feels good to say that, especially
after a whole semester of covering horren-
dous Big East football — but Monday alone
offers two Final Four-caliber games.

The No. 4-ranked Syracuse Orange are
one of only four remaining unbeaten teams
in men’s basketball this season, and they will
put it all on the line when they travel to the
Steel City to take on the No. 5 Pittsburgh
Panthers in a battle for-the No. 1 spot in the
conference, and likely a top-three ranking
in the country. Neither team can get caught
looking ahead, however, because both play

ing too much for Connecticut.

Other important conference games over ’
the ‘next week include Marquette at No. 17
Louisville Saturday, No. 11 Notre Dame at
St. John’s on Sunday and Cincinnati at Notre
Dame on Wednesday. There are also two big
nonconference games — Maryland plays at
Villanova tomorrow and West Virginia hosts
No. 8 Purdue on Sunday. q

Because there are so many teams in the
Big East in basketball, each week I will rank“
only the-top eight for my’ power rankings.
This will not only save space but also give the
teams incentive to win, because obviously
they want to be included on the list.

Power Rankings L:

1). Syracuse Orange —— This is pretty
much a toss-up between ’Cuse and Pitt and
could very well change by next week.

The Panthers-Orange game this upcoming
Monday will be a classic battle of a top-tier
offense versus a tremendous defense.

tomorrow. The Orange host Cincinnati and
the Panthers host Seton Hall. ° _

The Panthers- Orange game this upcom-
ing Monday will be a classic battle of a top-
tier offense versus a tremendous defense.

Pitt is arguably the best offensive team in '

the country, ranking ﬁrst in assists per game’
(20.1), six“‘ in rebounds per game (42.2),

11”‘ in ﬁeld goal percentage (.490) and 18“‘
in points per game (80.6). Syracuse runs

coachjim Boeheim’s signature 2-’3 zone bet-
ter than any team in recent memory. When
a.great offen'se meets a great defense, the
game is usually decided by how play goes

between the offensive.power’s defense and
the defensive power’s offense.. Pitt has been
uncharacteristically average on defense this
year, and Syracuse only shoots 33.9 percent
from the ﬁeld. So, what’s the X-factor? The
Oakland Zoo, of course. Look for Pitt to pull
this one out.

The other game in the Big East on Mon-
day pits No. 7 Villanova against the host N o.
9 Connecticut Huskies. The Wildcats are a,
very balanced and talented team, pretty
much the Huskies’ opposite. It’s not that
UConn isn’t talented, but it gets by mostly
because Kemba Walker is nasty. Averag-
ing 25.3.points per game, he’s second in
the nation. If Walker’s supporting cast can
back him up, the Huskies could very well

» _ win this game, but I see Nova’s balance of '
perimeter shooters and interior scorers be— ’

2). Pittsburgh Panthers — The Panthers
have been on ﬁre, winning six in a row since
their only loss to Tennessee in early De-
cember. ’ _

3). Villanova Wildcats —— ’Nova has won
10 in a row since its only loss (also to Ten-
nessee) and is ﬁrmly holding on to a spot in
the Big East’s “Big Three.”

4). Connecticut Huskies —.Kernba Walker
continues to shine with the Huskies bounc-
ing back from a disappointing loss to Notre
Dame with a one-point, overtime victory
over No. 12 Texas. -

5). Notre Dame‘ Fighting Irish —- The Irish
surprised a lot of folks this year with their
high level of play before suffering a very bad
blowout loss to Marquette on Monday.

6). Louisville Cardinals — The Cards are
ranked N o. 17 behind early seasonvictories
over Butler and UNLV, but they have suffered
bad losses of late to No. 7 Villanova, No.‘ 12

(Kentucky and unranked Drexel.

7). Marquette Golden Eagles — The
Golden Eagles are in the midst of a Big East
gauntlet: Starting with Pitt last week, they
play the No. 5, 11, 17, 11, 9, 4, 7 and 19 teams
over a 10-game span.

8). Georgetown Hoyas —— Georgetown
started hot but, as is the recurring theme
for this team,_ is starting to fade. The Hoyas
have lost four of their past ﬁve games by an
average of almost 10 points. I
