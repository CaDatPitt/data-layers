Such an attitude of indifference" on;
the part of a.large number of the stu-,0

dents is disgraceful. The man who
will noticven take part in the choice
of the men to whom is entrusted the
mana_-gement of student activities, is
one whose absence, would benefit the

school. If a student in the.University‘

of Pittsburgh does not have sufficient
interest

positive detriment to the University.
No matter what such a student may

say, in apology for his absence, the,
fact remains that he is proving himself‘
a traitor t.o his class when he fails to‘

‘Pitt ‘Patts

By Prowler.

There are so many things to write
‘about this week I scarcely know where
to begin. _Honestly, ‘I -have seen so

much during the past seven days that»
=I could‘ not start to reproduce, in the}
short space allotted to me, the impres- -

,sions I have received.

I imagine everyone
that Prowler man the wise fellow?
Thank you for the ﬂowiers——t~hey

But, I have a real compliment to
pay this paper, and incidently, this
department. Just a second, and you
shall have the truth (oh! Mr. Printer,
if we could just have some big, chesty
type. to set this thing olfl). The
Printer says it's a capital idea, but all
the large letters have been used on
the first page and none can be prom:
ised until next week. Pshaw!

Well, if we must play our own or-

Last Wednesday morning a chapel
:speaker was in the middle of an ora-
itorical ﬂight (a terrible place to be
without a life preserver or an aero-
rplanel) with every person intently
ilistening. I was just about to believe
’everything the good man said, when
;suddenly the corridor outside was
iﬁlled with the melodious strains of
“Oh, You Beautiful Doll.”,

Was it aband? ,Was it a singer?
jNo, oh, no, it was a blithe Freshman
lwhistling in the smoking room down-
lstairs. That’s all.

' Now, there is nothing more con-
genial than a healthy whistle—:—espe—
.cial1y on a dark night when the police-
%men are “at lunch.” But. I believe we
lean arrange the schedule to include
separate hours for chapel and whis-
tling. 1’

What do you think, fellows?
’ The Prowler.

Mari. ‘Box
,Editor Pitt.Weekly: _

Dear—Sir:——I am writing to you in
the hope that you,will call attention
to the poor attendance at the class
meetings at which there ‘took place the
election of senators, especially in the
'Economics school. In one of our
classes three men were present out of
about fifteen men. Such lack of at-
‘tention to the interests of our depart-
',ment is highly commendable in the
‘men absent. It shows their extreme
ﬁself—sa-criﬁce in boosting their classes.
Of course we must‘ suppose that those
absent were sickor at least absent
from school. None. of them
have been found in the smoking rooms’
Seriously, something is“wrong and un-
less we remedy it immediately‘, we
will find
a Senate.

BURGOYNE LECTITRES.

Arthur G. Burgoyne spoke before
,the class in Journalism on Monday
jnight. Mr. Burgoyne’s talk was con-

laughter. Ancient humor was reviewed
;by Mr. Burgoyne, who stated that
‘nearly all humor may be traced back
lto seven basic jokes. ’
i A reading from Geo. A. Lanigan’s
3“Akoond of Swat,” and also one from

1' 'v‘. The P. A. A. gymnasium was the
» scene of an exciting battle last Mon-

" .. 7 day night when the Pitt boys met the

 

 
 

"team representing P. A. A. Many

' 'who.had seen the Winged.Head team

playprevious to the Pitt game claimed
that a reversal of form was shown and’
that an opposite score will result in
«the next game of March'l3. In claim-
ing that bad form was shown, the fact
'rn,u'st be taken into consideration that

.,—.-'the_losi'ng_team always. seems to be

off ‘color and ‘great consideration is
due Captain Campbell and his aggres-
sive ﬁve. - G ‘ ‘ ‘

- . -Several Pitt men showed up par-

ticularly well, but the victory was
earned mainly through the splendid
guarding of Frishman and the shoot-
ing of Harley Campbell from the foul
line. "The latter made quite a record
as he tossed 18 foul goals out of 23.
D-enny- McGeary, the- fast P. A. A.
forward, is about the best man on the
Winged Head team andthe way that
Frishman guarded him was a revela-
'tion to local basket ball followers.

1 , ., McDowell tossed ﬁve baskets from the
_ — g,ﬂoor,_and all seemed to be from a
  ,,‘“di'ﬁ’icu,lt angle.

Captain Marks, the
former Penn star, and Foster“"Ral-
_" sto'n, a. graduate of Pittsburgh High
School, did the best work for P. A. A.
In‘ the second half, ‘Bill Budd, who

 ‘ earned Varsity"letters in football and

basket ball at Pitt last year, was sub-
stitiited for Leightner, -the P. A. A.

",_..guar-d, and showed that he had n.ot

Baseball Prospects Brzyh 1‘;

« Grape Appointed Manager,

Neither team played quite .asgood
a game as had been anticipated, but
nevertheless the "contest was fastand
exciting. Pitt was not up to her
standard in goal shooting and Tech

‘seemed to be a littleioﬁ’ in passing.

Pitt drew ﬁrst blood when Harley
Campbell drop-ped one in the basket
and in a few minutes a foul goal was
added before Tech .scored. Good
guarding by Captain Campbell and
Frishman kept the opposition down
while Ochsenhirt, McDowell and
Harley Campbell kept Pitt well in
the lead. The ﬁrst -half ended 15 to
6 in favor of the Gold and Blue.

Pitt ran the score up to 22-10 .at the
start of the second half, but Tech took
a‘ spurt and added seven points to
their total before time was called.
This game was the ﬁrst of a series for
the college
burgh and the next game will be
played on the ﬁooriat-Trees Stadium.
Should Tech win t-he next game the
deciding one will be played on a neu-
tral ﬂoor. .With' .an even break of
luck, however, Pitt should win the
next contest with ease as her team is
undoubtedly superior to the Plaid ﬁve.

Each successive game points more
and more to the fact that Coach
Flint is one of the best men in ‘his
line of athletics io the country and
Pitt was very fortunate in securing
the services -of such an expert; The
team work and shooting of the five
has shown wonderful improvement in
the past -month and this is due to

good -coacihing, "aggressive spirit and

a determination to place the Old Gold
and Blue of Pittsburgh at ‘the very
top -of the flagstaﬁf. The lineup:

In Football Rulesi

Field Is Shortened and, Scoring Is
Rendered Less Difficult by New
Rules.

Radical ‘Changes     

 

The “meeting of the Intercollegiate"
Rules Committee ended last Saturday
and the changes which -these experts
were the most radical in the
history of the game, except, perhaps,
the year when the forward pass was
adopted. «

One of the most surprisingichiangcs
was the shortening of the playing
ﬁeld fr-om 110 yar-ds to 100- yards. This
was done in order to allow for a ten-
yard zone to be established behind
each goal post and forward passes are
allowed to be hurled into this terri-
tory. l‘n -the past a forward pass was
declared dead on crossing the goal
line which allowed the secondary de-
fense to strengthen -the primary de-
fense when within the danger limit.
This usually resulted in the opposition
being stopped short and the low score
so much in evidence last year, re-
sulted. ‘As it stands by the new rules
the secoiidafy defense must remain
well backeven when the ball is within
a few inches of their goal line, -or the
opposition will toss a forward pass
over their heads and all will be off. If
the ﬁeld had been left 110 yards in
length and 10 yards had been ad-ded
at bo.th ends, it would have been im-
possible for many of the colleges to
‘have laid off a football ﬁeld on their
former -grounds. \

The onside kick is also _a play of
the past and not of the future—it is
more according to the new rules. This
play was lucky and was the pause of
many fluke scores—-evidence: Indians
17, Pitt‘ 0; Cornell 9, Pitt 3. We are
at last rid of a poo.r formation.

The number of downs to gain the
necessary 10 yards has been changed
to four instead of three and this is
the only feature that points to the
new games returning to the much
censured football of old. This change
will make the game of 1912 directly

opposite to that of 1911, as the offense,
will have a too great advantage over;
the defense. Scores of 24-18, 30-24.;
etc., should be common next year un—!
less the football experts are able to
work out a new method of defense
The value of the touchdown has also
been increased from 5 to 6 points with
a goal from touchdown and goal from
ﬁeld remaining the same.‘ This will
tend to reduce the number of ﬁeld
goals kicked, and also make larger
scores in the future.

The 20'ya1'd zone of the forward
pass has been removed which is an-
other “large score” factor. Other
minor changes’ were made, but the
above mentioned are the most radical
The game will probably be as unsuc-
cessful next year as it was this year
or perhaps much worse; ﬁrst, because
the offense has been given too much
advantage over the defense; second
because necessary distance per down
has been decreased to such a poin-t
that plays are apt to bee-en-tered at

The appointment of Robert Grove
’l4, as Manager of the baseball «team
has cleared matters up in this line
and Pittites are now sure of a Varsity
team on the diamond. The.new man-

ager has had experience in baseball 1

as he piloted the 1914 team. last. year
successfully. The prospective‘ sched-
ule includes a series with VV. & J-
Carnegie Tech and Penn State, while
oﬁers have been received” from Buck-
T1631. Westminster, Dennisuton, Otter-
bein, Grove._ City, Mt. Union, Western
Reserve, ‘Allegheny, F, & M, and
others. -While, it.is rather late to ar-
range a schedule,‘ it is thought that

Manager Gr-ove will be able to ﬁll it-

out within the next few weeks.

The next item of interest is the ap-
pointment of a Coach and Director
Miller has taken this matter up and
willlland some one shortly. , He tried
to get Deacon Phill-ipi and also Sam
L_ever, but was unable -to close with
either. Negotiations are now -oii with
Frank _Killen, a former Pirate twirler,
and Tom McCreery, and in all prob-
ability one of these men will coach
the Gold. and Blue aspirants.

In the meantime, Director Miller
has been lining up the available ma-
terial prospects, if one can judge from
a paper team, certainly look bright.
Among the eligible men are Pollock
of Cliarleroi High School, who twirled

< on last year’s Pitt nine during its short

existence; Paterson, of Conway Hall;
Harenski, of Chicago High School:
Haines, of Wilkinsburg High School:
Neckerman, of Shadyside Academy:
Cooper, of the 1911 Penn Freshman
team; McDowell, of the Varsity bas-
ket ball’ team, and Bligh, of McKees—
port -High School, all twirlers. -The
catching material shows Sul»off,Allen.
Stambaugh and Johnston. For the in-
ﬁeld "there are the following men:
Hopps, of Spokane High School; Mc-
Quiston, McDonald High School;
Pratt, of Pittsburgh High School:
Graves, the football player; Elmer
VVeger,_ the all—around athlete, and
Geary, of Wilkiiisburvg High School.
For the outﬁeld there are many can-
didates.
Smith, Varsity guard on the football
team, who won fame as a baseball
star at Bellefonte Academy; Ochsen-
hirt, of Allegheny High, who has made
good on the Varsity basket ball ﬁve:
Connelly, sub—qi‘iarterbacl< on the grid-
iron team; McNary, of PllitSl)L11"\g"i1
High School and a member of. the
1911 team, and Camp, of Tarentum
High School. . , ' '
There is muchexperienced baseball
material in the University that the one
year niigratory rule will bar, but the
Eligibility Committee will insist on the
strict enforcement of this rule. Ed-
wards, Lafayette’s second baseman
last year; Grubbs, a W. & J. twirler;
Firestone, of Allegheny College; "Rip-
ner, of Marietta College, and several
others are prohibited from Varsity
competitio_n by this rule. ,  -

“I would like to be told whereaand

sibly can. As things are now I do
not know where or when the games
are played until too late for me to ar-

' “I wish to call special attention to
the series of receptions to the secon-
dary schools in and about Pittsburgh,
to be given on -the next three Friday
evenings. Every student that is able
should be at these receptions. Theise
receptions did a great amount of good
last year and we want t-o make them

“I want to also call the attention of
the students to the great "movement
that isgoing on in Pittsburgh just
now — the Men and Religion Move-
ment. It is a great work anda work
that every student in the University
should be interested in.
