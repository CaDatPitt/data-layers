BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Campus police may strike if no
settlement of‘ a contract dispute
with the University is reached‘ by
midnight Sunday, according to a
letter from union ofﬁcials giving
Pitt 72 hours to reach a ﬁnal
agreement.

Negotiations have reached a
deadlock over a wage-increase
issue, the use of outside ﬁrms for
University security work and the
number of hours of City Police
working "part-time for" the campus
force.

“A majority of campus police
don’t want to strike,” said union

. representative Officer Robert

Kolesky, “but what else can you do
when they're going to stick it to
you?

“They want to replace four
policemen with - security guards,
and they just recently hired three
more part-time policemen from the
City. They’re threatening us with

our jobs.”

“They told us at the meeting
yesterday that ‘it’s not our present
intention to eliminate your jobs.’
How would you feel if I sat here and
held a loaded pistol to your head
and said it wasn’t my present
intention to blow your head off?.”
Kolesky asked.

According to head of University
Employe Relations Tom Cherry,
there are no plans to eliminate the
Campus Police force.

“The job is simply to make the
most efﬁcient use of the Campus
Police force,” Cherry said. “We’re
not after their jobs. Their security
is built right into the contract.
Even if we made them security
guards, they would be making the
same pay.” ‘

Police union demands included a
$.65 per hour raise, a halt to the
practice of subcontracting ﬁrms for
security work on campus and a

stricter limitation on the number of "

Pitt Repliesto PA Review

BY GENE GBABOWSKI

Pitt ofﬁcials have announced that
cost-cutting suggestions in a
state-level review of University
operations had been considered
earlier this year.

Governor Shapp’s management
review team, which began its
two-month Pitt study in May and
gave recommendations on a state-
wide basis for both government
and state-supported schools, pro-
posed a number of cost-cutting

,measures to be adopted at Pitt in

an ofﬁcial report received by the
administration yesterday morning,

Among those measures ofﬁcials
already had considered were:
—merging Clarion State College-’s
Venango _campus_ with Pitt’s

Titusville campus, for a projected

savings of $200,000 yearly.

--reducing mail distribution on
the Oakland campus to one delivery
daily, for a projected annual
savings of $20,000.

--making the University press
self-supporting, saving perhaps
$110,000 annually. _

--establishing a consulting ser-

Campus.Cops

BY GEORGENE KALEINA

Two campus policemen were
held up at gunpoint Wednesday
evening in Varsity Hall, the
Campus Police headquarters, ac-
cording to an ofﬁcial police report.

An unidentiﬁed man armed with
a pistol robbed Sergeant Edward
Pendergast and police officer
Thomas Large of their wallets,
along with guns and ammunition
from the gun cabinet, the report
said. .

The robber was black, about 6-1,
185 pounds, and wore brown pants
and a yellow and white shirt, the
report stated.

After entering the building
around 8:40 pm, he pressed his gun
against Large’s left temple and

\demanded the ofﬁcer’s gun, the
report said.

The armed robber then pushed
Large over to Pendergast, pressed
his gun into _Pendergast’s ear and
demanded his wallet, according to
the report. ,

After the wallets were surren-
dered, the man skedfor

of the ushers at Three Rivers.”

Several sections of the stadium
already have been designated for
student seating, according to
Bluestein. '

In other action, the SGB
unanimously decided to aid in the
formation of a committee of student
University employes to examine
the question of unionization.

' “There is a need for an
organization to protect the rights
and secure demands for students,”
said student employe Bill Oliver.
“When we complain, we’re told
that other students would be glad
_to have our jobs. '

“If the University had to deal
with an organization of student
workers, they wouldn’t push. us
around.

“We’re forming this committee
to get feedback from student
workers to see what they’d like,”
Oliver said. “The procedures we
might use to solve specific
problems will be discussed at our
meeting on Tuesday.”

The organization of student,
employes would not be afﬁliated
with any national union organiza-
tion, Oliver added.

SGB President Larry Platt
reported complaints from various
sources about student aid at Pitt.

“The most important complaint
is that the length of time between
submission of an application and
ﬁnal action from the Student Aid
Ofﬁce is ridiculous,” Platt said.‘
“Delays cause anxiety and unne-
cessary struggles to locate alter-
nate funds.

“There’s a form of ‘welfare
mentality at the Student Aid Ofﬁce,
I've been told,” Platt said.
“Students are treated like welfare
recipients when many scholarships

and loan funds are available to‘

middle-income families.”

Platt also criticized invoices from i
. Student Accounts.

time of registration when to expect
an invoice,” Platt. said. “The
invoices also are confusing.” 1

The SGB also discussed the
deﬁcit in the Student Government
budget. “There won’t be a
full-scale audit, "but we’ll check
lists of expenditures for student
groups that showed deficits,” Platt
said. -

“We also want to check how

‘ groups received funds they were

never allocated.”

BY VALERIE STRUBLE

A campaign to persuade the City
of Pittsburgh and the Oakland
business community to hire a
permanent sidewalk cleaner in
Oakland is being sponsored by the’
South Oakland Citizens Council
(SOCC).

Two thousand Oakland residents
and shoppers have signed SOCC
petitions demanding cleanup of the
litter from fast-food chains and
bars. The petitions are intended to
make businessmen aware of the
problem and take responsibility for
its solution.

“Oakland businessmen don’t
provide enough trash receptacles
and don’t empty the ones‘ they
have,” SOCC administrator Kil-
leen Spangler said.

“Asa result, garbage ﬁlls the
cans and spills over on the
sidewalks.

“We’d like to set up a meeting
between community groups, busi-
ness owners and City representa-
tives to see what can be done about
the problem,” Spangler said.

The City of Pittsburgh, however,
has no responsibility to clean the
sidewalks, according to a spokes-

charge for the advising“ work done
by Pitt faculty, for an estimated
$300,000 per year savings.

Vice Chancellor of Business and
Finance Joseph Dutton, to whose
department most of the recom-

mendations apply, said they came .

as ‘no surprise to him.

“We’ve already anticipated
many of the suggestions made by
the team,”. Dutton" said. “It (the
..team) took a long-range look at our
system while we were working on
and, in many cases,‘ implementing
money-savin g policies.’ ’

Dutton said University ofﬁcials
have known for some time the
Titusville campus has not been
used to full effectiveness in its
geographical area.

“We’ve known that our Titus-
ville campus was under-utilized
and we’ve also known that
Clarion’s Venango campus has
been under-uti1ized,” Dutton said.
“Since March we’ve discussed the

possibility of merging the two.” ~
Dutton added Pitt reduced its

$20,000».

tion of a concrete program. V ' -' _

be free in using their expertise in
consulting business and govern-
ment,” Smith said. “The report
makes the assumption that Pitt
faculty members are using Univer-
sity facilities and University time to
do research, but that isn’t very
often the case.”

Although Smith said he didn't
think " the consulting corporation
would work, he added that more
study on the matter would be
necessary.

Associate .Vice Chancellor of the

' Health Professions Edison Mont-

gomery, whose department re-
ceived a recommendation to
establish a health services corpora-
tion providing the Medical School
with faculty services, said a
program similar to the one
suggested had been in use for some

-time.

. .The program, called the Private
Doctors’ Office fund, enables
clinical faculty to practice medicine
in their offices in Scaife and Salk
Halls or in hospital offices, and bill
patients for services. Receipts
from the bills are used in part,
according to Montgomery, to
augment the faculty members’

salaries as" well as support the

Medical School.
‘Under the review team’s recom-
mendation, this program would be

I stepped up and institutionalized for

maximum profit, but Montgomery
said he was wary of the plan.
“The problem here is to see that
faculty members don't spend too
much time with private patients,”
Montgomery said. “Generally, we
want to try to extend the proﬁts of

private practice, but not at the
expense of a loss in teaching.”

Chancellor Wesley Posvar agree
with the department heads, saying
the recommendations of the Gov-
ernor’s team fell into three
categories——those already under-
way, those with some pros and
cons, and those unfeasible.

Among the suggestions Posvar
said were considered unfeasible at
this point were the recommenda-
tions to make the Universit press
self supporting and the impiemen-
tation of a sophisticated dorm
security system.

“Currently, the University press
needs a subsidy of $100,000 a year
to operate,” Posvar said. “It
publishes educational books and
materials that commercial publish-
ing houses would have no interests
in because they’re not best sellers.

“The electronic equipment nec-

essary to implement the recom- q

mended dorm security system is
too expensive. The first estimate
we received on its cost was $3
million———the review team said it
would'cost around $75,000.”

Posvar said the suggestions
made by the Governor’s manage-
ment review team were a construc-
tive effort to aid Pitt even if many
proved unworkable.

‘ ‘If only one or two‘ money saving
items emerge from this, the review
will be a success,” he said.

Posvar said the administration
would release a preliminary state-
ment in response to the team’s
findings today, adding that a
detailed response would be put
together for the Governor in the
near future. ‘ ‘

“The City is responsible for
street cleaning from curb to curb,"
the Spokesman said. “Sidewalk
maintenance is the responsibility of
the property owners."

The Squirrel Hill Urban Coali-
tion (SI-IUC) employs an individual
street cleaner from the Vocational
Rehabilitation Service. Squirrel
Hill businessmen contribute to his
wages.

“He’s been working two years
now and there’s been quite an
improvement,” SHUC spokesman
Richard Cohen said.

“But there’s still a problem.
What we need now is education.
People have to learn that they just
can’t throw their garbage all over
the sidewalks.”

The SOCC has sent out ﬂiers
requesting Oakland residents to
write letters to the Oakland
Chamber of Commerce, the Oak-
land News and the Pittsburgh
Press. The feedback has been
disappointing, according to Spang-
ler. ~
“Even if the businessmen
wouldn’t be willing to pay to have
all sidewalks cleaned in Oakland,”
Spangler said, “we’d be happy if

they hired someone to concentrate I

on the area from South Bouquet
Street to Meyran and from Sennott‘
to Fifth Avenue." ’

instruction to comply with state law
and then lay them off?

. Both Graham and Cherry agreed
capitulation on the issues of
subcontracting and part-time limit-
ation would narrow University
options in the future and would be
poor management.

“Once something ‘gets into a
contract it never comes out,”
Cherry said. “You never want to '
give up what you already have. For
instance, we have to give the

Campus Police a raise in line with
other raises on campus. We have
to deal with six unions here, and to
do anything else would create a
whipsaw effect.

“Everyone would want more. It
would be a spiral,” Cherry said.

Graham has already prepared
schedules in the contingency of a
police strike Sunday at midnight,
with remaining administrative staff
taking 12-hour shifts for the
duration of a walkout.

“We’ll have coverage, that I can
promise you, as well as ambulance
service. If you need an officer,
you’ll get one.”

The two sides will meet again
today at 10:30, am with a state
mediator in an attempt to hammer
out an agreement.

“Faced with the demands
they’ve given us this far, there is
not a great deal of compromise we
can make,” Cherry said. ‘

“We’ll try anything and every-
thing to reach an agreement,”
Koleski said. “It’s going to take a
push to put us out onthe street.”

After hitting them with all the “

“where do you go to, school?”
(Carlow) and “what are you
majoring in?” (ﬁve nurses) I still
hadn't succeeded in boring the
little ladies.

In fact, nurse Connie, a

Hmm. Maybe I should just forget

serve youth. Unlike other orders whose apostolate_ha_s changed
with varying conditions, the Salesians always have been —- and
will be, youth oriented. Today we're helping to prepare young-
sters for the world that awaits them tomorrow. Not an easy

task but one which we welcome.

And how do we go about it? By following the preceptsof
our founder, Don Bosco. To crowd out evil with reason, religion
and kindness with a method of play, learn and pray. We’re
trying to build better communities by helping to create better men.

As a Salesian, you are guaranteed the chance to help
the young in a wide range of endeavor. . . as guidance counsel-
ors, technical and academic teachers, as coaches,
psychologists . . . in boys clubs, summer camps. . . as mission-
aries. And you are given the kind of training you need to

achieve your aims.

The Salesian family is a large one (we are the third largest
order) but awarm one. A community with an enthusiastic family
feeling where not only our talents are shared but our short-
comings, too. If you feel as we do, that service to youth can be
an important mission in your life, we welcome your interest.

   New Grant for Hockey

_ A solution to a long-standing problem seems to have emerged with
' p the Athletic Department’s grant of $1,000 to the Hockey Club.
The situation was ' at its worst last winter when the Student

-  1 Government and athletic oﬂicials locked horns over who ‘should be

 ‘responsible for the club’s fimding. In the end, it was Student

- .. ;'Govemment that agreed to assume responsibility for the club, though
 was never really laid to rest.

. L Though the department’s grant is limited, it could be a sign of more
complete ﬁmding to come, as Athletic Director Casimir Myslinski has I

his sights set on varsity team once the proper facilities can be built.

This must come as a tremendous satisfaction for the members of the

A  , Hockey Club,’ who last year faced with some dire ﬁnancial
‘circumstances. _ Their perseverance through a rocky season will be

rewarded handsomely when Pitt fans can enjoy hockey as a varsity

sport.

We commend Myslinski’s decision to appropriate the grant and his

plans to expand hockey at Pitt.

Off-Campus Dorm Life

. , It's hard not to sympathize with Pitt students at’the bottom of the.
totem pole of priorities who are forced to live in the Webster Hall Hotel

and Carlow College dorms.

Such an off-campus setup brings with it many inconveniences that
, students in the Towers and Quad don’t have to face. i
__ Take meals, for instance. While on some mornings it takes an extra
effort to" get up in one of the Quad buildings to eat breakfast in ‘the
Towers, or while residents at MCNR have to trek on weekends to the
Towers for meals, none of this is comparable to the jaunts displaced
students face living at Carlow and Webster Hall.
Another problem, and a more serious one, is walking to campus
. events and facilities after dark. There’s no question students are safer
- living across the street from the library than living six blocks away. p
The sad part of the situation is just about nothing could’ve been done
this year to avoid it. Colleges across the colmtry are being swept by the
return-to-the-dorm trend, and so Pitt’s dilemrm isn’t a rare one.
All we can do is hope next year’s return isn’t quite so severe and
urge the Housing Office and the Ofﬁce of Admissions to coordinate
their efforts to make sure all students will be placed in adequate

dorms.

Low onfuel

BY DAN MULHOLLAND I

In the last few years, America
has been faced with one of the most
perplexing problems in its history.
It has become apparent that our
supply of fossil—fuels (ie coal, oil
and natural gas) ‘rapidly is
depleting. The situation is so bad
many observers have forecast
massive shortages as near as this
winter. It is obvious some
alternative must be found.

That source is nuclear energy.
Unfortunately, a small but vocal
band of self-styled ecologists and
consumer advocates effectively has
stymied the further development of
this important energy source. It is
high time we take a closer look at
the situation, one that will clearly
indicate nuclear power is the best
course to take in regards to the
current energy problem.

Consider these facts. First -and
foremost, nuclear power is safe, in

It's About Time

For New Bulletin

Being a junior in CAS, 1 have
now been deciding on the courses I
would take each term, for the past
two-and-a-half, by referring pri-
marily to the CAS 1972-1973
Bulletin. The apparently intended
lifespan of this publication ob-

— viously has not been the actual life

. span, since the College has not
published a newer model.
I can understand that printing

1 costs have risen since then and that

there was a surplus of Bulletins to
be gotten rid of (as I was told by the
Advising Center on the ninth floor
of the Cathedral last winter term).

Notwithstanding this situation,
conditions course-wise in the

’ College have not remained static.

The things that I know of that
have changed are that many of the
professors have changed (those
that have left are still listed and
new ones that have taken their
places are not), that in the case of
the English and biology depart-
ments in particular, the course
afferings and/or numbering sys-
»';e"-ms and/or course contents have

, c"-‘winged, and that now (as I read in

V"-Vrlnesday, October 15, issue of
 Pitt News, “Council Eyes
Fm;-ulty Rating” article) there will

pressing issue such as the alleged
Student Government deficit.

However, it could pose as a
problem for incoming students as
well as a present irritation for other

students here already.

If the administration finds it too
costly to print a sufficient number
of new Bulletins for both present
and future. students, a possible
alternative might be’ for them to
have yearly updates for the
departments or disciplines of the
College printed and be available
either on request or for a minimal
charge. Anything would be
preferable (except for the term
course reviews put out now which I
don't consider as good supple-
ments to the Bulletin) to not
knowing who is offering what.

Treating Students

Like Numbers

Through the method used to
handle the housing shortage, Pitt
has intensified the feeling that the
individual is nothing but a social
security number. Residents were
shuffled all over Oakland because
of the bad planning on the part of
the Housing Office. Holland Hall
residents were also inconvenienced
by the creation of triple-occupancy
rooms. -

Now the University is proceeding
in their same inconsiderate way by

" 1:9 m§ to..;. i



roommates by the end of Decem-
. If no one volunteers to leave
the room, the Housing Ofﬁce will‘
decide who will go. The girl who is
moved out will have to become
reoriented to new surroundings,
and will again be faced with the
prospect of an incompatible room-
mate. Also, the student has no
choice in where she is going to be
sent, which means she could be
moved into the undesirable Tow-
ers.

I realized that the University is
too big for everyone to receive
personal attention, and that, it is
impossible to keep all of the extra
girls in Holland Hall. But I do not
understand why the University has
so many extra students. If better
judgment had been used this
spring when students were being
accepted, students would not have
to be shuffled from room to room
now. In the future, I recommend
the University only accept as many
dormitory students as they can
house, to avoid any more housing
shortages that require people tojbe
treated with such inconsideration.
Better planning beforehand will
prevent many problems later._

fact far safer than the current form
of electrical generation, coal-ﬁred
plants, which kill 200,000 people
everyiyear as a result of‘ the air
pollution they produce. To this
date, no one has been killed or even
been injured seriously as a direct or
indirect effect of a nuclear power
-plant in almost 20 years of use.
Moreover, the only recorded case
of an accidental release of
radiation from a plant was in
England in 1957. And even then no
one was harmed, nor was there any
increase in the incidence of any
diseases.
In addition, the chances of future
" mishaps are very low. The
probability that the backup and
safety features on a reactor of
modern design would breakdown to
the extent Ralph Nader speaks of in
his “maximum credible accident"
scenario are roughly 10,000,000 to
l, somewhat akin to the odds of
being bitten by a poison viper on
the corner of Forbes and Bigelow.
When these figures are contrasted
to your chances of dying in _a fatal
auto crash, (10,000 to 1), the lack of
risk in nuclear power becomes even
more plain. ‘
Consider also that unlike fossil

fuels, the supply, of uranium is.

virtually unlimited, and taking into
account the spiraling costs of
conventional fuels, nuclear power
becomes economically attractive as
well.

On the other hand, if the
antinuclear forces have their way,
the economy would suffer the
immediate loss of the $120 billion a
year nuclear industry, which would
have even more far-reaching
ramiﬁcations. The “no growth”
situation, which would lead to a
loss of approximately 800,000‘ jobs
in "the next 10 years, not even
accounting for new entrants into
the work force who would be
unable to secure employment:

The other objections to nuclear
energy can be dealt with easily. It

A Case for Nuclear Power

is physically impossible for a"

nuclear plant to turn into a bomb as
some fear. Thermal pollution is no
longer a problem since the
technology to deal with it has been
implemented since 1972. Neither
are nuclear wastes. If the entire
electric capacity of the United
States was nuclear, the resultant
wastes would take 350 years to fill a
pit 200 feet per side. And while
exotic fuel sources such as solar
and geothermal power may have
their uses in the future, they have
yet to be proven feasible on a
large-scale basis, while nuclear
power has.‘

Just who are these individuals
who have sought to prevent
America from obtaining clean, safe

and economical energy? One of the.

foremost among them is Ralph
Nader. the self-appointed consum-
er champion, who in this current
crusade is doing everything in his
power to ruin those whom he
purports to protect. All of his
charges. no matter how unsubsta-
tiated, are accepted as gospel and
promulgated by the media.

At the same’time, reputable
scientiﬁc opinion is rarely, if ever,
heard, as witnessed last April when
34 scientists, including 11 Nobel
Prize winners, were denied an
opportunity to speak in favor of
nuclear power on national TV.

Nader's position is rendered
even more untenable by the fact
that a recent Harris poll found 63%
of the public favor building more’
nuclear power plants while only
19% are against it. The poll also
revealed 64% believed nuclear
power was safe, as opposed to 13%
terming it “not so safe,” and only
5% who felt it “dangerous.”
Thes.e ﬁgures should be kept in
mind the next time Ralph Nader

claims to speak in behalf of the

American people.

BY PAMELA EUSI beautiful things came across. The
orchestra was able to watch the
conductor and respond to his every
wish.

The ﬁrst part of the program was
devoted to Western music. A
Passacaglia by Handel contained a
wealth of ‘ emotion and superb
control on the musicians’ parts.
Contrasts and dynamics were
emphasized and the result was
unique: Western music with an
Eastern ﬂavor.

Chaconne by Purcell contained a
large ,amount of repetition and
“echo sections.” The fervor and
energy with which the group
attacked their music was astonish-
ing considering they are amateurs.

Ein Kleine Nachtmusik by
Mozart came next and even though
only the ﬁrst movement was
played, rhythms were precise,
technique was good and the quick
pace established at the outset was
maintained.

Now onto the Armenian melodies
of the evening-they were...differ-
ent. The ﬁrstoone sounded like a

dance melody and employed
various themes on the melody.
Intricate, rich harmonies sprang
from the ﬁrst and second violins.

Sixteen amateurs from Armenia
appeared onstage at the Frick Fine
‘Arts Auditorium and presented a
ﬁne program of Western and
Armenian chamber music Wed-
Most of the
_ performers are architects, art
designers and the like, but by their
way of music-making you.’d hardly
know it. -
The performance was in some
ways a study of the Armenian

manner of performing, their folk
,3 songs and their speech.

Ofﬁcially known as the Chamber
Orchestra of the Yerevan Polytech-
nical Institute, the group is
conducted by Sergei Agadjanyan, a
ﬂamboyant, eloquent man who
knows his music. One thing I found

. ‘especially interesting was through-
out most of the concert very few of
the-orchestra members used music
or even looked at the various stands
provided. I have never seen this
done with this large a chamber
group.

This non-use of music ﬁt in well
with the concepts and style of
Agadjanyan. His style. of conduct-
ing was formal and forceful but

Then an Armenian vocalist
stepped onstage to do a couple of
folk melodies; an Amazon, dressed
in a long, blue velvet gown with a
big, artiﬁcial red rose was going to
sing! But true to form, Marietta
Antonyan ﬁlled the auditorium as
her voice alternately boomed and
cried out the tender melodies. She
completely captivated the audience
and demonstrated a very personal
style of interpreting a folk song.

As a last touch the orchestra
performed some works from

individual solos and folksy themes

Pills that Kill

 

Denver's ‘Win Song’:

Hollow as

BY TOM WASELESKI

Windsong, John Denver.
RCA, APL 1-1183’.

    

5

Jon Denver has a way of

   

bang

‘short on creativity the way funeral

directors have a way of being short

, on humor.

But just as morticians keep
packing away those dead bodies,
Denver keeps turning out hit
albums, dead though they may be.

Windsong is an appropriately
titled collection of empty songs
whose strongest element is Den-
ver’s monotonous voice. Despite
the appeal to the earth and sea, a
tendency of Denver's if not a bad
habit, there is little socially
redeeming value here. _~

Some of the background orches-
tration" sounds like it came off the
soundtrack of a B-movie. There are

    

a Canyon

a couple of “Thank God I'm a
Country Boy” type tunes that’ll no
doubt make you feel ashamed
you're listening to them in
Pittsburgh and not Nashville,
Memphis or Whiskey Downs, Ala.

Denver apparently is trying to
prove that after singing about
mountains, rivers and valleys, he
can sound as hollow as a canyon,
and make people like it, too.

Though ~ “Cowboy’s . Delight,”
“Fly Away,” and “Calypso” have
good melodies, Denver would’ve
done music a favor by giving them
to someone else to produce.
Denver’s_ work on all these songs
make them suitable for Top-40
radio; if success for him lies in 45s,
this album is quite successful.

But even his singles of late have
been a far cry from “Take Me
Home, Country Roads” that made
him famous. The one off this
album, ‘‘I’m Sorry,” is the height
of Denver boredom, with all its
crooning of loneliness in the city
and love gone wrong. The
strangest line ever in a pop love
song has to be the line in this one,
“I’m sorry for the way things are in
China...”

Which I guess serves to prop up
the cardboard singer, but with
enough jolt to knock him all the way
over.

‘Gold’ PansMedicaI World  

BY CONNIE GIEL

There’s Gold in Them ‘ Thar
Pills, Alan Klass, Penguin Books,
183 pp., $2.25. A

What you don’t know is killing
you. Those who do»know—doctors
and lawye'rs—are letting you die.

A bottle of Valium, calm-main-
taining, sleep-inducing; Valium,
represents a contribution not to
medical science, but to the coffers
‘of the insidious, proﬁt-oriented

apology at times, both for the
cowardice of doctors and also to the
patients who suffer because of it.

Pills.ominously reveals the
beginnings of an Orwellian “in-
creasingly drugged society” in
which the public has become an
unsuspecting, integral of the
medical-industrial complex.

The conflict, originating before
the discovery of mass-marketable
wonder drugs, between those who‘

man, heaps scorn and abuse upon
the profession supposedly dedi-
cated to maintaining physical and
pmental health. There’s Gold in

who do not, has changed from
benign tumor toa massive cancer
in the health system. ,

The drug industry and the
medical profession, according to
Klass, ‘should be locked -in combat

instead of in an amorous embrace.
The spectacle is disgusting, Klass
says. i“No gallbladder, no
appendix, no uterus is safe in its
anatomical home” while this
fraternizing continues.

Pills operates with holes in its
rubber gloves. Klass paints a Grim
Reaper carting off a sick, penniless
consumer, the victim of a greedy
drug manufacturer and gutless
physician. But, he says,;homo
expirus deserved it.

His defense? As a medical man
on the spot “The public is not
simply a passive receiver of all the
medications it swallows.” The
sick, not-so-sick and neurotic get
what they ask for, be it Thalido-
mide, Valium or DES.

His solution? (Now, as public
defender) Secondarily, to re-edu-
cate the public, “so that the
antibiotics or sedatives are not the
inevitably expected conclusion of a
visit to the doctor.”

Primarily, the doctors them-
selves must refrain from any more
‘childlike pawing through the
doodads and geegaws offered by
the drug companies. The
fascination with the newest must
be replaced by a reliance on the
best. Klass’ argument hemorr-

The public is again defenseless;

regrets. .

This patient-as-victim and pa-
tient-as-perpetrator confusion, per-
haps intended as an “on the other

complexity of the problem is
compounded when Pills fails to
pinpoint the blame, and therefore
the solution. -

Pitt Out To SinkNavy

BY TOM HALL
Associate Sports Editor

It would seem to the observant
Pitt football fan that the Panthers
are beginning to enjoy Homecom-
ings. Hopefully, the trend will
continue when they shoot for their
ﬁfth straight win, their sixth in
seven games, against the Midship-
men of the Naval Academy
tomorrow at Pitt Stadium.

Homecoming games have been
very favorable to the Panthers;
they crushed the -Temple Owls
(55-6) at their homecoming and
spoiled Army's (52-20) during the

Of course, the Navy will present
a special contest the Panthers
haven’t had to deal with in recent
games. Tony Dorsett and Elliott
Walker have padded their averages
in the past. Even the passing game
is beginning to look as sharp as a
razor on a Schick commercial.
these feats have been wrought
upon teams with haphazard defen-
ses. .
What can the Panthers do, their
offensive talents unmasked,
against the number-two defensive
team in the country?

Several things could happen on
the road to a bowl bid this Saturday

the Middies.

The Panther defense is not so
bad either.
Moorhead, Holloway, Romano and
Weatherington, the ‘defense has
given up a mere 13.5 points per
game. Take out that unfortunate
game against Oklahoma, in which
many of the Sooner scores were the
direct result of turnovers, and that
ﬁgure fades even further.

“We are in the heart of the
season," said Head Coach Johnny
Majors. “A loss at this point in the
season would be crucial. I don’t
see anyone on the practice ﬁeld

‘T with a smug look in their eyes.
We’ve got to keep moving
forward.”

Andi forward they go. The

remainder of the schedule looms ,

ominously. No one can be
overlooked. Thisincludes Navy.

“Navy~is an extremely’ well-
organized ball club,” Majors said.
“They come into every game as
well prepared as they can be. This
is attributable to George Welsh,
who is an excellent coach. They
(Navy) gave us a tough game last
year, and I expect the same from
them again.” .

Navy lost to Boston College,
17-3, last week, the highest point
'5 total given up by the Middies this

season. They live, and sometimes

die, on their defense, headed this
season by all-American candidate

Chet Moeller (6-0, 189) who roams
' all over the ﬁeld from his rover

back position.

He is backed up by senior
linebacker Andy Bushak (6-4, 230),
who hits like a defensive lineman
and gets his licks in like . a
cornerback. Of Navy’s
defensive starters, nine are ‘sen-

The Pitt cross-country team will
lay its win streak on the line
tomorrow at the United Nations

’ Invitational. The Panthers, 4-0,
will face their strongest competi-
tion from Kent State and Edinboro.

Kent State's ﬂat six-mile course
and tough opponents should
challenge the Panthers in their
quest for an undefeated season.

Edinboro and Kent State, bothof
which beat Pitt last year, have
strong teams again this year. Kent
State may be slightly favored to win
on its home course, but Pitt
sophomore Dave McDonald thinks
otherwise.

“Kent State canceled their dual
meet earlier ‘because they were
afraid of us,’-' McDonald~ said. “It

’ should be a closerace between
Edinboro, Kent State and Pitt; but
we're up to get Kent."'

Pitt will be represented by

Led by the likes of-

11,

iors, presenting the Panthers with
a strong, experienced defense.

Sure, Dorsett could ﬁnd the
holes. Perhaps the Middies’
defensive line can’t stack up to the
likes of the Pitt offense. Sure; the
Panthers once again could come up
with another lopsided win. But
don’t bet on it.

Navy could be the team to spoil a
Homecoming. Maybe even a
season.

Smith.Found Ineligible

Pitt freshman Kelvin Smith has
been declared ineligible’ to play
basketball this season under’ an
NCAA ruling requiring that
athletes have at least a 2.0 QPA, it
wa_s announced yesterday.

Smith, a‘6-11 center from state
champion Schenley High School,
will not be able to participate inthe
sport, nor will he be able to accept

(an athletic scholarship until‘ he

completes his freshman year with
at least a 2.0 grade-point average.
Pitt’s declaration of his ineligibil-
ity was prompted by a request from
another school to the NCAA that
Smith’s QPA be rechecked.
Smith apparently had made
some failing grades in high school,
but had retaken and passed the
courses. Schenley, in computing
his ﬁnal grade-point average, left

ed a 2.01 for Smith.

Though this ‘method of QPA.
determination often is used in other
school systems, the Pittsburgh City
Schools do not follow this practice.
Since NCAA regulations stipulate
the procedures must be applied
consistently in any given school
system, Smiths’ average was
recomputed.

Smith is allowed to transfer
should he wish to play for another
team. However, the same
regulations would apply if the
school is an NCAA member. '

A University statement released
yesterday said Smith may qualify
for scholarship aid from nonathletic
sources, which would enable him to
remain at Pitt.

  Bootersﬂosting G
City This Saturday     

BY JIM LEWIS
The Pitt soccer team hopes
be two crowning
ceremonies this Homecoming
weclrrnd.

T ‘.0?

That’s right. Pitt will crown a
queen tomorrow, and the Panthers
hope to crown Grove City today at 5
pm at Pitt Stadium (A JV game is at
3). _ .
Although Pitt’s playing at home,
Friday’s game is not ‘a sure win;
truthfully, the Panthers‘ hardly
have been the king of their castle.
Out of its seven home games, Pitt
has rung up a below-average 2-3-2
record, despite an impressive 1-1
tie with powerful Davis and Elkins
last Saturday. , _ 6

Mistakes cost Pitt in that game.
“We scored two goals that game,”
Coach Leo Bemis said regretfully.
“Our fullback just miskicked it and
put it in our net.”

Pitt hopes not to have to bow
before the tyrant Mistake on
Friday. Grove City is a team that
capitalizes on them.

“They are a team to be reckoned
with,” Bemis agreed. “They have
always been tough for us.”

Tough is right; Grove City has 10
lettermen from last year's team.
Add the fact the Wolverines have a
6-2-1 record so far this year, and no
wonder they place themselves on
the throne of small college teams in
this area. .

Pitt hopes to overthrow Grove
City. They have good reasons to

gals Bengals Bengals Bengals Bengals Falcons
efs Broncos Chiefs Chiefs Broncos Broncos

I" -I do J

believe they can do so. First, Pitt 5

edged City last year, 3-2, in Grove

City. That has to be a conﬁdence . 

builder for any team.

Second, the up-and-down
Panther offense showed signs of an
upswing in the two overtime
periods against Davis Elkins. Even
though they've only scored 14 goals
in 10 games, the Panthers, led
offensively by Al Jutca with six
goals, are quick and capable. The
rest of the line——John Curley, Tom
Murphy, Bob Graham, Mark Nigh
and John Morahan—has a total of
seven goals and is able to put
points on the board. I

The defense has to be one of the . I
best in the.,team’s history. Goalie’ A '

Frank Bucci and backs Kim Blasko,

' Andy Behrend, Craig Connolly and '
Mark Gannon—have allowed only

11 goals in 10 games, including
three shutouts. They’ve made
more heads roll than Henry VIII. A
Although they have impressive
statistics, the Panthers will have
their hands full with»Grove City.

tough for us,” Bemis said, shaking. ' _

win would give them a big winning
season.” _
Pitt would get into the winning
column with a victory Friday. (So
far, the Panthers have a 4-4-2

record, not exactly indicative to  ' " 

their good play.
But the Panthers hope Friday

will be a good day for a crowning- .

Sparky Compares
Cincinnati to

Yankee Dynasties

BY WILL GRIMSLEY
AP Special Correspondent

BOSTON AP—Now that the

Cincinnati Reds have won the,"
World Series, Manager Sparky '1

Anderson can be excused for
puffing out his chest and bragging
a little. -

“I have said it before and now I
say it again—we’re the best team
in baseball,” he insisted Thursday,
reviewing his team’s victory over

the'Boston Red Sox in one of the »_

hardest fought and most exciting
‘ Series in‘ history.

The snow-haired skipper indic-
ated there was Only one player on
the/rival team—the veteran Carl
Yastrzemski—who might crack the
Reds’ lineup, with another one
rating perhaps a tossup.

“I am not talking about

pitching. For instance, if we were
able to pick up a capable pitcher of
the caliber of Tom Seaver, Jon
Matlack, Don Sutton or Andy
Messersmith, it would be unfair to
the other teams in baseball.”

Heindicated the Reds then

would be so overwhelming that '

they would compose ' a dynasty
comparable to the Yankee teams of
the Babe Ruth-Lou Gehrig era and
Casey Stenge1’s Yankees of the
1950s. _

“We are strong in every
position,” he said. “I know of only
one player" that
interested in trading for.
Greg Luzinski of the Phillies.

“He is a great player and I think
he will be greater. He has
everything to become a superstar.”

Anderson was asked how he
would compare the ﬁeld personnel
with that of the Red Sox, who

proved themselves the best of the ‘

American League and who fought
the Reds to the bitter ﬁnish in the
World Series.

“Okay,” replied Anderson,
seeming to relish the little game of
baseball hypothesis.

“You have the money. Now for

‘ ‘Our club‘:

catcher, would you rather buy M

Johnny Bench or Carlton Fisk?

“Go to ﬁrstlbase, do you take!

Tony Perez or Cecil Cooper? At
second, who do you want—Joe
Morgan or Denny Doyle, at third
Pete Rose or Rico Petrocelli and at
short Dave Concepcion or Rick
Burleson?-”

The Reds’ manager indicated—~

' without saying right out—-that a

man would be divorced from his
senses if he didn’t man the inﬁeld
with Perez, Morgan, Rose and
Concepcion.

“Now the outﬁeld,” he contin-
ued. “Remember, you have the
money. In right, who do you
buy-—Ken Griffey or Dwight
Evans? In left, is it George Foster
or Carl Yastrzemski, and in center
is it Cesar Geronimo or Fred

Under questioning, .Anderson
conceded an edge to Yastrzemski,
one of baseball’s best all-around
operatives.
