Posvar Upholds Ali Decision 

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar
has upheld a decision by Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome
Rosenberg not to re-new black
studies lecturer Yusef Ali, who said
he will sue after his contract
expires Saturday.

“I am satisﬁed that the decision
made by the Dean was reason-
able,” Posvar told Ali in a letter

Language Gap

Triggers CAS
Shore-Up

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN

Undergraduate College of Arts
and Sciences students are com-
plaining increasingly about an
English language barrierin the
classroom between the students
and certain foreign graduate
teaching fellows and assistants who
have not yet mastered spoken

English, according to Director of‘

Sophomore Advising Dave Luedde.

Luedde said Monday his advisors
are receiving complaints, primarily
from math and natural science
students, who claim they can’t,
understand some of their foreign
teaching assistants (TA) and
teaching fellows (TF) because of

_ this communications gap.

reverse the decision of the Dean.

The letter also said Posvar, after
meeting with Ali last week at the
lecturer’s request, had reviewed
black studies chairman Curtiss
Porter's recommendation that All
be reappointed as a lecturer.

“That was a rather trite
response,” said Ali, “and it rather
simplistically deals with the situa-
tion, but it’s‘ sort of what I
expected. I ﬁgured the admini-
stration would stick together.”

Ali, who three weeks ago called
his meeting with the Chancellor
“the first step toward, a possible
resolution of my case," yesterday
claimed that meeting was “an
appeasement. I didn't hear him
(Posvar) say anything one way or
another that led me to believe he
would react differently than he
did." .

His University appeals exhaust-
ed, Ali said he ‘has contacted a
lawyer and will take the University
to court. “I'm going to fight it
every way necessary," he said.
My
lawyer is checking to that. After
Saturday, I’m going to fight the‘
University full-time.”

Ali claims the reason for his not
being re-hired are political. He
says he is being denied a contract
because of his political activity and
that the decision is part of an effort
to decrease the black studies
faculty “by attrition.”

He also said he_ is contesting
Rosenberg's decision “out of
principal.”

Chem Chairmen To

BY PETE BUTCH

The chemistry department
initiated a three-year
chairmanship with the appointment
of Frederick Kaufman as chairman
succeeding W. E. Wallace April 8.

Kaufman said he favors the
rotation, a practice followed by
such major universities as Harvard
and Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, because it keeps “no
one person from making a
particular imprint on a depart-
ment.”

Wallace stepped down from the
department chairmanship this
spring after 14 years to return to
teaching and research.

Kaufman said he

sion begun under Wallace.

the

ment is becoming somewhat scarce
also.”

The chemistry department cur-
rently has record graduate and
undergraduate enrollment and this
year conferred 130 B.S. degrees.

“Science is back in. The time
when it was passe to study science
is over, Kaufman said. “More
chemistry majors are being attract-
ed each year.” ‘

“He (Rosenberg) said I’m
unqualiﬁed. Those are statements

that will get him sued. He’s the one _ _

who is unqualified.”

Ali said Rosenberg “has no 
experience inlblack studies and if he
did want to learn about them, he 

would have to sit at my feet and I'd
be his guru; he’d be like a
freshman.”

Rosenberg said politics did not

affect his decision, which over- ‘-

turned a unanimous recommenda-
tion by the black studies faculty.
“Absolutely none,” he said. “It's
nonsense. The reason (he was not
re-hired) is he did not show the
required progress in his profes-
sional development and I've told
him that."

Rosenberg said he would not go
further into Ali’s case because “I
don't like to discuss qualifications
of our faculty in public and he's still
a part of the faculty until
Saturday.”

Kaufman has been a professor in
Pitt’s chemistry department since
1964 and also directs the University
Space Research Coordination Cen-
ter. His career specialization is in
the area of chemistry of the upper
atmosphere.

He developed a reputation as a
kineticist and photochemist with
U.S. Army ballistics research
Laboratories at the Aberdeen

proving ground. Concurrent with .

his army affiliation he was a
part-time lecturer at John Hopkins
University.

Kaufman has served on major
study committees for the National
Academy of Science dealing with
chemical aspects of damage to the
upper atmosphere due to the SST
and flourocarbons.

“I intend to continue my
upper-atmospheric research during
my tenure as department head,”
newly appointed chemistry depart-
ment chairman Frederick Kaufman
said. “It was the condition with
which I accepted the position." .

Next week Kaufman will deliver
the annual G. B. Kistiakowsky
Lecture at Harvard University. His
topic will be “Elementary Rate
Processes in Flow Reactors for
Science and Society.”

incidental expenses incurred travel-

and Programming Committees
funding. I

“About three weeks ago when
Supreme Artists told us these two
bands wanted to play here, wehad
$4000 in our account because of one
concert cancellation and thought it
was just a matter of changing names
and ﬁling for a budget modifica-
tion, ’ Andy Coleman, programming
committee co-chairman said.

Granting of the budget modifica-
tion was hampered by unsuccessful
attempts’ of programming and
allocations to formalize the appro-
priation. .

When the programming commit-
tee and Josh Baylson, the Student
Government Board (SBG) pro-
gramming liason, came to the
regularly scheduled allocations
meeting, allocations denied fund-
ing for the concert, stating “to rush
a program of this nature through
the production stages greatly
decreases the quality of the show."

“The committee sees the need to
adequately publicize a show in
order for it to be successful,
especially during the spring and
summer sessions,” according to
the allocations report.

“The committee feels that the
calculated cost per person is
excessive; the cost figures out to be
$5.30 for each person to attend this
show based upon the expected
attendance of 300. There is also no
admission charge to help offset
overhead expenses,” the ‘recom-
mendation stated.

“After reading the allocations
committee recommendation for no
funding, SGB tabled the proposal
yesterday because no programming

f ~_ representative attended the meet-

ing, ” Baylson said.

“But, we did pass a proposal to
allow programming to submit a
budget modification to cover all
incidental expenses incurred by
both bands for coming here.”

The programming committee
originally had requested $1500 to
pay the two bands.

Up All Night manager Bob
I DeKett labelled the incident a result
of poor planning on Pitt’s part.

Pitt Police
Hire New

Image-maker

Pitt’s campus police department,
in an apparent effort to improve its
image with students and the
Oakland community, has hired a
former Homestead police lieutenant
as its ﬁrst community relations
specialist. - «

Charles Westbrooks, a 1974
graduate of Pitt’s administration of
justice program, already has set
several goals he would like to
accomplish from his new position.

“I’ll be trying to work with the
community, students, faculty and
police officers, trying to open the

lines of communication,” West-
brooks said. “I want to further
establish communication between
the campus police and the
surrounding community. ’ ’

Westbrooks also said he would
try to familiarize students with the
operations of the campus police and
would attempt to work with “the

juvenile segment of the community,
trying to cut down some of the

incidents irrfwhich juveniles are ‘ s

involved. ” ' -

“All the departments of the
University should be more selective
in the foreign students they bring
over from other countries if they
expect them to be placed in front of
a classroom to teach,” said Chris
‘Rawson, associate chairman of the
English Department and co-author
of a three-clause resolution asking
for more “stringent requirements”
to test graduate students’ command
of the English language.

The resolution, which passed the
University Senate Council March
16, asks for “every department or
school that uses assistants or
teaching fellows in undergraduate
instruction, where the language of
instruction is English, will take
steps, prior to their appointment, to
insure that the oral English
competence of these teaching
assistants’/ fellows’ speech must be
adequate for classroom or labora-
tory teaching.”

In addition, it asks that “if a
deﬁciency does exist, steps will be
taken by the department or school to
correct it and that no person with
such a deficiency will receive a
teaching assistantship/fellowship
requiring the use of English in
carrying out classroom or laboratory
duties during any year following his
or her first year of residence at the
University of Pittsburgh. ’ ’

Clause three calls on “the deans
of each school to be responsible for
the enforcement of the ﬁrst two
clauses, which entails establishing
standards of English competence,
and, if necessary, systematic
procedures for verifying that
candidates for teaching assistant-
ships/fellowships meet. these stan-

dards. ’ ’ _ —
Rawson said he believes the Test

of English as a Foreign Language
(TOEFL), a ﬁve-part standard test
used throughout the United States
to judge the English ability of
foreign students, should be supple-
mented with other testing before
TAs and TF5 are permitted to teach.

“Since it is a written examina-
tion, TOEFL does not measure the
foreign TAs/TFs ability to speak
English orally in front of a
classroom, but primarily tests their
ability as students, not as
communicators to a class of
students,” Rawson said.

As it exists now, TOEFL is ad-
ministered to all Pitt foreign
graduate assistants and fellows, if
they are assigned classroom or lab
duties.

The test, however, cannot
determine the oral and spoken
mastery of conversational English,
but rather listening comprehension,
English structure, vocabulary,
reading comprehension and writing
ability.

According to Director of Interna-
tional Student Services Ralph
Morrison, many foreign graduate
students who eventually teach in

classrooms and labs go to the
English Language Institute (ELI)
for language instruction. ELI is a
department that offers language
courses for students whose native
language is not English.

ELI admission is reserved for
students who can presentgevidence

tion and graduation. Courses at
four levels of study are a 20-hour per

iate intensive course, tuition $650; a

mediate course, tuition $500; and an
advanced skills course.

“We have no real statistics on
how many of the foreign graduate
students from Pitt come down to
take the course,” Karen Billingsly,
a secretary at the institute, said.
“However, I’d like to stress the
courses are not geared toward
preparing a student to take a
TOEFL examination.”

“Admittedly, I can see where a
language barrier could exist
between a foreign graduate student
teaching in front of a classroom,”
said Morrison. “But I’m afraid

“I feel that the TOEFL test is a

  Control of Nyden’s Fate

The results of the fifth “final” internal review of Paul Nyden",
the sociology professor whose contract is not being renewed and ex-
pires Saturday, is due any day. Nyden claims his contract is not
being renewed because of his Marxist beliefs; the administration
declines comment.

M A
This fifth review board, a panel of four representatives from the    mm“ M‘

University Senate Council plus an independent faculty member
chairman from the law school must recommend ot Chancellor
Wesley Posvar whether he should abide by previous decisions to
release Nyden -or allow him to remain in Pitt’s tenure stream.

If Pitt were a corporation the trusteesiwouldv be like the board of
directors and the chancellor would be the corporate president with
‘final decision over who is employed and who is not. This Univer-
sity Senate panel would be a review by Nyden’s more established
peers who would recommend to the- boss whether or not his con-
tract should be renewed.

But Pitt is a University, not a corporation. This panel is-the
ultimate faculty appeals body and it behooves the chancellor to.
base his actions upon consideration of their recommendation. T_hc_
committee is taking the time and making an effort to organize,

‘ meet, take testimony and reach a consensus on the Paul Nyden

case. It is up to the chancellor to insure that their effort is not
wasted. V '-

A decision like this is better in the hands of an ultimate peer
review panel than left with a chancellor briefed by legal advisors
and eager assistants.

As a sign of good faith, in the waning hours before the commit-

A tee decision, the chancellor should indicate whether he will follow

the panel recommendations to the letter or use them to help reach a

decision.

«Heshould announce this before he knows whether or not the
panel agrees or disagrees with his plans for the future of Paul

_ _Nyden.

Register to Read

Those optimists who still believe that the Pitt system places the
student higher on the priority list than student dollars can gather
evidence to the contrary by attempting to check out a book at
Hillman Library without one’s summer registration or proof of fall
registration. -

An undercover staff reporter attempted to . check out
“Economic Theories Behind Railway Location” by A. W.
Wellington but was denied the privilege because of his expired
winter registration card. A fall registration receipt——that pink slip
with grimy carbon back—would have sufficed, but—alas——he did
not have it.

These-papers prove one is a student by the full fiscal meaning of
the word. They represent a financial obligation to the University.
Evidently library administrators feel that this obligation is reason
enough to trust a young adult with one of their books.

,Granted——action must be taken to curb thefts of library material.
But why should this action require students to carry an additional,
inconvenient form? ‘

The library has access to Pitt’s computer system. Why not store
a record of students registered for fall? Those who wish summer
borrowing privileges need only volunteer proof of
registrati0n—-—once, have their name recorded, and be allowed to
borrow books for the remainder of the summer. ’

Studio Theatre Explains Ticket Policy

In response to the letter to the

several things.

Speciﬁcally, in the case of the

mances were sold out in advance.

Whenever a reservation was made,
the patron was informed that all
reservations must be purchased by
15 minutes before curtain time, in
this case by 7:45. Many of our
reservations are made by a

knows the perpetrator of the crime?

Ithink statements such as this do

' much to keep the crime of violence

against women from being taken
seriously. When women are raped
by acquaintances, does this make it
less of a crime?

Maybe Kurt Graham should stick
to reporting the facts—-with no
personal interpretation.

this information was included on the E

answering tape.

The reason for this policy is
expedience and fairness. A theatre
usually will have approximately 10
percent of reservations non-attend-
ant. Therefore, after the sell-out
point has been reached, all
attempted reservations are placed
in chronological order on a waiting
list. Beginning 15 minutes before
curtain time, the waiting list is sold,
and then those who have appeared
without reservations are accomo-
dated in chronological order.

This system has been in practice
for some time. We are now working
on a more efficient system, but it is
difficult to ﬁnd one to please
everyone. We are "open to
suggestions, however.

I have no idea as to the amount of
professionalism in the University
Theatre at the University of.
Wisconsin. But I do feel it is a

useless comparison. The Studio
Theatre operates in as ‘ ‘profession-
al” a manner as possible. We are
not University Theatre, we are a
student organization, funded by
Student Allocations. Although
faculty personnel are available as
advisors, all shows are produced by
students, members of the Studio
Theatre Organization.

If Mr. Angelucci implies that the
“caliber of actors and variety of
productions” in the Studio Theatre
do not match Wisconsin's, he
should seek employment as a critic.

It is the desire of the Studio
Theatre to accomodate and please
its patrbns. We are sorry that Mr.
Chuck Angelluci did not see ‘ ‘Three
Sisters,” and hope he travels the
600 miles again sometime and has
the chance to enjoy one of our
productions.

More Evidence On
Comp Sci TA Votes

I’d like to add one more piece of
evidence relevant to the complaint
in the March 30 Pitt News by
Kenneth Quayle of computer
sciences that he was denied the
right to vote in the FAS-GSO
sponsored collective bargaining
preference election.

On March 3, FAS Graduate
Council, which is made up of faculty
elected from FAS and graduate
student representatives from GSO,
voted ﬁve to two with one
abstention to recommend that
Elizabeth Baranger, -FAS Dean of
Graduate Studies and chairperson
of the Council, provide the G50
with a list of FAS graduate

employes eligible to vote in the
election to facilitate identification of
voters during the polling. Dean
Baranger noted that the University
lawyer, William Hannon, had said
there were no legal objections to
doing this. She thought, however,
if would “legitimatize” the results
of the election too much. It appears
from Mr. Quayle’s complaint and
from the letters responding to it in
the April 1 Pitt News that Dean
Baranger did not heed the
recommendation of her Council.

 Trite and Hollow Victory’

It appears now that the University
of Pittsburgh has won its battle
against Dr. Paul Nyden. David has
been done in by Goliath!

Common Pleas Court Judge John
Hester “granted the University an
injunction against seizing buildings
and holding demonstrations which
block entrance ways or interfere
with normal operations at the

campus”(Post-Gazette, 31 March).

I wonder if Judge Hester is an
alumnus of Pitt? And who
inﬂuenced him the most?

More interesting is that “the top
policymaking body of the American
Sociological Association (ASA) has

cleared the Univeristy of Pitts-
burgh’s sociology department of
charges it ﬁred Paul J. Nyden (sic)
because of his political beliefs and
activities." (Post-Gazette, 29
March) This new position of the
ASA proves only that professional
groups know which side of their
bread is buttered and by whom. Far
be it from these professionals to
touch anything remotely political

lest their interference disturb their
own selﬁsh feedback loops, funds,
grants, etc.
principle might prove "to (be a
negative feedback loop for them.

All things aboutthei year, long, .

An opinion from '

Nyden-versus-Pitt case considered,
the echoes of injustice will
reverberate in the Pitt campus for a
long time to come. Among these
echoes will be a verdict against
Nyden by his fellow professionals,
his department confreres, a secret

verdict smacking of star-chamber
procedure. Another echo will be the
possibility that not only academic
freedom was mauled but that First
Amendment rights were imposed
upon by, first, the sociology
department and, second, by the
University decision makers. These

latter persons plainly availed‘

themselves of the ancient rule in

Common Law that any employer can

need not concern himself with

It seems to me the University of
Pittsburgh has won a trite and
hollow victory. I have supported

there were American constitutional

University of Pittsburgh, an admir-

that one must support and ﬁght for

Paul Nyden’s loss to the
University of Pittsburgh is a

community loss whose values, or .

lack of values, will not be stopped by
campus boundaries. It may well be
that a common confusion exists in
the campus concept that only a

HERE'S ONE ENGINEERING OPPORTUNITY
YOU WON'T GET IN PRIVATE INDUSTRY2

  If you’re thinking about a

career in engineering, think
about this.

How many companies can
offer you a nuclear submarine
to operate? The answer is
none. Equipment like this is
available only in one place. . .
the Navy. ’ I  

The Navy operates over
half the nuclear reactors ~
in America. So our traini_ng is
the broadest and most com-
prehensive. We start by
giving you a year of advanced
engineering technology. In
graduate school, this would
cost you thousands, but in

the Navy, we pay you.

Once you’re commissioned
as a Nuclear Propulsion
Oﬂicer, you’ll earn a top
salary. Over $24,000 a year c
after four years. And you’ll be

responsible for the most
  advanced equipment  

developed by man. All the
Navy asks inreturn is that
you serve for 3 years on active
duty upon completion of your
training.

You have only until May
15th to enroll in this year’s
Navy Nuclear Propulsion
Candidate Program. If you

are majoring in engineering,

math or physical sciences,

NAVY OFFICER.

IT'S NOT IUSTA IO. IT'S AN ADVENTURE.  

contact your placement office
to ﬁnd out when a Navy
recruiter will be on campus.
Or call toll free, 800-841-8000
(in Georgia, 800-342-5855)
for more information. And if
you’re still a junior, ask about
the Navy’s NUPOC Collegi-
ate Program, which pays you
up to $6,000 during your
senior year.

to nuclear training, no
one can give you the same
opportunities.

For Disaster?

By MARY HUZENIC

How would you react to a national
disaster?

You’ll have the opportunity to
ﬁnd out by watching “The National
Disaster Survival Test,” a 90-min-
ute program to be aired Sunday at 8
p.m. by NBC as part of its “Big
Event” series. _

The program will be produced by
Bush Productions, whose president
Warren Bush wrote and produced
the national drivers’ test for CBS in
1965. The National Safety Council
also was involved in the production
of Sunday's survival test.

The drivers’ test program won
several awards, including the
Peabody Award, and was called
“the highest-rated public" affairs
program in the history of televi-
sion.” It generated more mail than
any other television program-

But unlike the drivers’ test, which
focused strictly on traffic safety, the
national disaster test will concern

itself with all types of safety—pub-A

lic, home and industrial, as well as
traffic—within the context

Pitt Greeks Bear More Than’ Gifts  

By DEANNA LOUISE

Sometimes they get arrested,
most often’ just reprimanded for
soliciting illegally.

Yet “it’s just not worth going to
the Greek Week formal if we don’t
win" the annual charity drive,
Delta Sigma Chi house manager
Cris Maranuck said. '

Grossing $6,500 this spring, the.

fraternity, for the ﬁfth straight
year, copped the Roberto Clemente
Memorial trophy awarded for the
most money collected by a Pitt
fraternity or sorority.

“This year was the first year we
met our goal,” Delta ‘Sigma Chi
member Bart Huchel said. Huchel
was Delta Sigma Chi president
during the drive before the yearly
changeover last month in fraternity
administration.

The $6,500 mark is also an
all-time record at Pitt, where the
Greeks collectively scrimped
$23,000 for the American Cancer
Society. . ~

“Getting psyched to collect
money is like going out to play a
football game,” Huchel said.
“During the ﬁrst few weeks, other
fraternities start grandiose rumors
about the thousands they've
already collected, just to anta-
gonize our brothers." ,

Collecting for charities has
always been a major concern and
tradition for Delta Sigma Chi both
at Pitt and the Johnstown campus,

'1 Huchel said.

This fraternity also sets a
$200-per-person goal which they
“came close to this year, but
haven't met yet.” Huchel said.
The average was $163 dollars per
man, although four members
collected over $500 each.

“It's a hard sell." Huchel said.
“lWe"try to hit as many people as
we can. On a good day we can
collect $25-30 per hour."

Those who collect large sums
spend a lot of time skipping classes
and evading the law.

H As long as it’s not in the eyes of Caught again"

“The police getmiffed when

or suburb limits. But, Huchel said.

the permits are difficult to obtain
and levy enough specific restric-
tions on the solicitor to make
proﬁt-making frustrating.

In the interest of public safety,
for example, qualifications in city
law prohibit persons from soliciting
in the streets or at red lights.

“No one has ever been convicted
for soliciting without a permit,”
Huchel said. “They just take us for
a short ride, inform us of the law
and threaten us with arrest if we're

with complaints that they’re being
hit two or three times for money."

Even when~a permit for Greeks
to solicit downtown on Tag Day was
issued, Huchel said, the police
looked down on it and suspended
the issuance of permits for the rest
of the drive.

“Sometimes people are reluctant
to give because they think it’s
going into your own pocket,"
Huchel said. “It really helps to
wear a Pitt hat or fraternity T-shirt

and especially a Sugar Bowl\

button.”

By combing the ci.ty and

suburbs, the 40 Delta Sigma Chi v

brothers averaged the most money
per brother of all Pitt’s 17
fraternities participating in Greek
Week for" the sixth consecutive
year.

The living ‘room of the fraternity
house, located on Carnegie Mellon
University campus is decorated in
early American-trophy decor. Last
year's trophy for the most money
for the Allegheny Valley School for
Exceptional Children collected by a
Greek organization is bigger than

_N Pitt’s Sun Bowl trophy, Huchel
said. But they’ve been trying to
get it fixed after it was broken last
year by a grappling over-zealous
winners attending the Greek Week
formal.

rationality of science. He begins with the modest suggestion that science pro-

gresses by seekingthe solution of problems, and for the first time he explores in
detaiﬁthe consequences of this view. In the end he reaffirms that the progres-
siveness of a theory is most closely linked with its problem-solving effective-
ness, and concludes that “rationality consists in making the most progressive
theory choices.” Laudaii’s notion of progress is closely argued and leads ulti-
mately to a theory of_scientific growth consonant with historical examples.

This work provides a fresh and stimulating perspective on the course of hu-
man intellectual affairs, and will afford provocative reading for the historian
_.,_ and sociologist as well as the philosopher and scientist.

sociate in the Center for Philosophy of Science.

Jazz/ Rock Hits Hard Via Weather Report  

[9

By PETE DICKS

“J azz-rock” fans were treated to
an evening of high-energy music by
Weather Report and Al DiMeola,
Tuesday at Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial Hall.

Weather Report demonstrated
why “Down Beat” magazine’s
reader poll has chosen them as best
jazz group for five years straight, by
playing one hour and, 20 minutes of
highly rhythmic music delivered in
bursts of energy with little break
between songs.

Although Weather Report has
often performed in a loosely
improvisional style, they executed
their music Tuesday night with

intricate tightness overwhelming,

the audience with a wall of sound.

Leaders of the seven-year-old
group, keyboards player Josef
Zawinul and tenor soprano saxo-
phonist Wayne Shorter, let all
members of the five-piece band
share the spotlight equally.

However, bassist J aco Pastorius
was an audience favorite because of
his amiable stage presence, some-
thing which is sadly lacking in many
jazz musicians today.

Wearing colorful sweater and
headband (later a baseball cap), the
25 year-old smiling Pastorius
constantly moved about the stage
and played a bass solo that left the
audience incredulous because of his
instrument’s unusual, diverse
sound and his excellent technique,

which occasionally employs har-
monics_. .

Pastorius, tours with Herbie
Hancock and has an album of his
own. Along with percussionists
Alejandro Acuna and Manolo
Badrena, Pastorius also is a recent
member of Weather Report having
played on the band’s seventh and
newest album “Heavy Weather”
from which much concert material
was drawn, along with songs from
their biggest selling record “Mys-
terious Traveller.”

Al DiMeola, former guitarist with
Chick Corea’s band——Return to
Forever—opened the concert play-
ing songs from his new album
“Elegant Gypsy” and his ﬁrst
album “Land of the Midnight Sun. ”

At age 22, DeMeola has proven
himself to be the greatest young
guitar talent in jazz today.
Lightning-fast solos, superb tech-
nique, excellent knowledge of the
fingerboard, and his confidence
force one to wonder how far he will
progress in the next several years.

Unfortunately, DiMeola may be
over ambitious by fronting his own
band. Tuesday night DiMeola
overshadowed his musicians with
ﬂashy, non-stop solos.

DiMeola played only one slow
song; the rest of the time he was the
focus of attention with inadequate
interplay between his guitar playing
and the keyboards.

DiMeola’s music was very
rhythmic because of the three

percussionists in his band, but some
of the songs in his S0-minute set
tended to run too long and sound the
same, whereas Weather Report
produced many textures of tonal
color and sound in tight, short
songs. '

DiMeola may have felt creatively
stifled in the band Return to Forever
because of the talents of Chick

Corea and bassist Stanley Clarke,
but he has not matured enough
musically to strike out on his own.
DiMeola still needs musical inter-

action with people as gifted
musically and as seasoned as Corea
and ‘Clarke.

Emmys Not Prime Time

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN

Leave it to television to muff up
the broadcasting of its very own
award show, the Emmys.

NBC has canceled the prime time
Emmycast for this year because of

- the feuding with the TV academy

and the only way millions of
television fans throughout the
country will get to see the 29th
annual awards show is if they-can

And even if you make it to

Considering the trash thats been
appearing under the Disney label,
“Freaky Friday” comes as a bit of
a surprise. No, it doesn't rank up

there with “Fantasia” and “Mary ~

Poppins,” but it’s one of the best
films turned out since the demise of
the old master.

“Freaky Friday” is the story of

13-year-old Annabel _Andrews,
played by Oscar nominee (for
“Taxi Driver”) Jodie Foster, who
wishes she could change places
with her mother, played by Barbara
Harris. Coincidently, Harris is
wishing the same thing and wonder
of wonders, a personality transfer
occurs—l-Iarris’ body receives Fos-
ter’s personality and vice versa.

From then on, the pace gets
hectic. Harris (who is really
Foster) tries hang gliding, skate
boards, and refers to her husband,
played by John Astin, as “Daddy."

Foster (who is really Harris) goes
on shopping binges and has the
least interesting of the two roles.
She does do a nifty water skiing
scene and while it’s all too obvious
that the scene was dubbed, it’s a
deﬁnite highlight. Still the adult
personality transferred to a teen-
ager’s body doesn’t really have
that much of an outlet for
outrageous sequences.

Harris, on the other hand, has a
field day as the child let loose in the
adult's body. She cracks a wad of
chewing gum continuously, spends

hours on the phone and lets the
housework go. When she finally
decides to take her turn at the
domestic side of life, she finds that
changing diapers is “yucky” and
she overloads the washing machine
with too much detergent, turning
the entire upstairs into aifroth of
bubbles.

Both'Harris and Foster arefme
in their roles. Harris stands out a
bit. more simply because her role is
written better and there are more
possibilities for funny incidents in
her situation.

Astin also puts. in 3 good
performance as the confused
husband and father who can't
understand why his wife wants to
Play Childish games and neglect
home and ' family while his
daughter is trying to run the
household. Naturally, both refrain
from giving him any sort of
explanation for what's happening.

The Supporting cast is good too.
Patsy Kelly has some fine moments
as Mrs. Schmauss, the house.
keeper. And a pair of good
comediennes, Ruth Buzzi and Kaye
Ballard, portray two swimming
coaches.

“Freaky Friday” is a cut above
the usual junk billed as children's
movies. It's light, funny, with lots
of action and an occasional ﬂash of
wit.

Still they don’t make fem like
they used to.

There will be no ofﬁcial Panther football until the latter
half of August, by NCAA mandate, but that doesn’t mean
all is quiet on the Pitt football front. In fact, it’s just as
interesting as ever.

Notre Dame’s pre-season press guide just hit
Pittsburgh, closely following the announcement that
Pitt-Notre Dame will open ABC national schedule Sept. 10
from Pitt Stadium. And it shows Jackie Sherrill will face
more than tradition when the Irish come to town.

Pitt’s Dorsett-less offense will face a defense that lost no
starters to graduation or anything else. It includes a
defending Outland winner—Ross Browner—and a
linebacker who was a wrestling All-American, Bob Golic.

Only four members of last year’s second-team defense
graduated and two returning non-starters own three Irish
letters.

The offense fared little worse. Only two starters—quar-
terback Rick Slager and split end Dan Kelleher—were
seniors last year and only four second-teamers don’t
return. I

The Irish seem set at running back, with the returnees
including three-year lettermen Al Hunter and Terry Eurick
at halfback and Vagas Ferguson, Jerome Heavens, Steve
Orsini and Willard Browner at fullback.

The quarterback position, a recent sore spot for Notre
Dame, is again a problem, with Ringgold High graduate
Joe Montana having as good a shot as anyone at the
starting lineup.

. Notre Dame is ranked second-best in the Football News’
 on rankings; Pitt took No. 4 in the same poll.

The Panthers seemingly are aware of the task destined

to confront them. After running against an alumni_ defense
thatgcouldn t touch him during a 31-yard scoring run,

sophomore runner Steve Harris had this to say: ‘ ‘I
wouldn’t say it was easy out there, but I really expect to see
more from Notre Dame.”

The problem for Harris and his teammates Sept. 10 will
be making sure the rest of the country doesn’t see too much
more from the Irish that afternoon.

 

Sherrill used a post-alumni game interview to reveal how
he’s sweetened the pot for walk-ons he has endeavored to
attract.

“We have atotal of 92 scholarships,” he said, “and that
leaves three open. I’ll evaluate the walk-ons and that’s
where those extra scholarships will go.”

Sherrill is making a special pitch for non-recruited help 2

because of NCAA roster limits that he says have been a

‘problem for him and other coaches across the country.

‘ ‘The depth problem is going to be a big, big problem for
everyone,” he said. “People who will win in November
will be the people who have a good second team. Take us,
for examp1e—with a few key people hurt, we would be a

Sherrill isn’t looking for freshmen, of which he recruited

said, “You’re going to lose a football game.”

It was nice to see Tony Dorsett, who didn’t dress for the
alumni, stand in an off-and-on drizzle for several hours
Saturday to accommodate a large crowd of young persons
desiring his autograph. And Dorsett’s reaction to the
crowd’s ovation after his introduction was interesting—he ~
ran onto the track, turned and snapped the crowd’s
picture.

But the best line concerning Dorsett’s appearance
Saturday came from a laughing press box observer who
intended ltitle harm when he remarked, “TD’s done more
writing this afternoon than he did in all of his class days at
Pitt.” ,

Pitt’s bid to make Matt Cavanaugh the second
consecutive Panther Heisman winner received a boost
when the NCAA announced Pitt’s quarterback would be
one member of a six-man group of players that will travel
across the country in August and promote ABC’s football
package. Among Cavanaugh’s campanions will be
Oaklahoma State running back Terry Miller, who wears a
girdle when he runs and also was the highest-placerd
non-senior in last year’s Heisman voting. Ross Browner
will be another participating player. 2

Tracksters Trek to Penn

By DAVE McDONALD

The Pitt track team travels to the

City of Brotherly Love this weekend i

to participate in the most presti-
gious meet in the country (outside of
the Olympic Trials and the NCAAs)
——the Penn Relays.

The Penn Relays always features
the track powerhouses such as
distance teams like Villanova and El
Paso, Texas and sprinting team
such as Tennessee and Arizona
State. This year at the relays many
former Olympians will be returning
to show they can perform—Marty
Liquori, Harvey Glance, Charlie
Foster, Bill Rogers and Kenyan
Wilson Waigwa.

Pitt will have only a limited entry
due to the demanding qualifying
times for the Relays. Making the
trip to Philadelphia for the Panthers
will be eight Pitt tracksters. The
two highjumpers on the squad, Dan
Goodyear and Keith Taylor, will be
competing before their hometown
crowd. Taylor's fans will get to see

him compete twice, for he will also
be jumping in the triple jump.

Pitt’s four-mile relay squad,
which finished a respectable sixth in
last year’s Penn Relays, will be
returning this year to better its
performance. Standout Nick Martin
has graduated, but the team of Mel
Boyd, Tom Herrmann and Nort
McDonald will be joined by
freshman Gary Siriano. In last
year’s Relay Pitt averaged 4:06 a
mile for the relay; this year’s team
also looks capable of that feat.

Pitt's two-mile relay, which was
the ﬁrst-place ﬁnisher at the Ohio
State Relays during the indoor
season with a ﬁne time of 7:37, will
be trying to better its mark on the
fast track at Franklin Field. In the
two-mile relay Boyd and Herrmann
will be joined by Dan Dattilo and
anchorman Rich Moore.

The Penn Relays is track at its
ﬁnest and if the Panthers hope to be
ﬁghting with the best they must do
better than their best. A crowd of
near 20,000, a fast track and some
good weather should help.

Fall to Solid 2 Slippery Rock

The Pantherette track team split a
dual meet with Slippery Rock and
Edinboro in Tuesday’s long delayed
outdoor season opener at Pitt
Stadium.

Pitt, with only a dozen or so
competitors, was simply out-
manned against Slippery Rock and
fell, 89-38. Despite entering only
one athlete in most events,
however, they triumphed over
Edinboro, 68-58. This close score
by no means indicated the nature of
the contest for the home team easily
won every event against the Lady
Scots.

The‘ highlight of the day was
Pantherette Carmen Scherich’s
javelin throw of 142 feet, well over
the qualifying standard for compe-
tition in next month’s national
championships at UCLA.

Michelle Bressant and Sue Lewis
gave the Pantherettes an early lead
by ﬁnishing 1-2 in the 100-meter
hurdles. Chris Cornelius placed
fourth in the 100-yard dash.

Highjumper Dan Goodyear will be competing in front of hometown tans when

After Karan Cerutti’s ﬁfth-place
performance in the mile, 400-meter
hurdler Maria Sciullo captured one
of Pitt’s five overall individual
ﬁrsts.

At this point the meet was
interrupted brieﬂy when chilling
rains that had fallen off and/on
throughout the afternoon once
again soaked the track and
competitors. When the drenching
ended, quarter-miler Janice Irwin
ﬁnished fourth as did long-jumper
Lisa Sciullo.

The 440-yard relay team of Pam
Shaw, Cornelius, Lewis and Bres-
sant later sloshed through the rain
to place second.

Overall third and fifth spots went
to Lewis and Jenny West-man in the
220- and 880-yard run, respectively.

Rounding out the track events,
the mile relay, comprised of Marie
Ribik, Karen Krichko, Maria Sciullo
and Bressantoutdistanced both the
Rockettes and the Lady Scots by 180
yards.

Tomorrow, Pitt leaves for College ,

Park where the Pantherettes will
participate in the University of
Maryland Invitational, one of the
top meets in the East.

llletters Split Home Bill
Against WVU, Dukes

By JIM PANE

The drastic change in perfor-
mance turned in by the Pitt tennis
team the last two matches can only
be explained by the weather.

Three days ago after handing
Slippery Rock a 6-3 defeat, the
Panthers were cruising along with
a 4-0 record when the West
Virginia Mountaineers followed the
dismal weather into town on
Tuesday and rained on the Panther
parade, 9-0.

Coach George Dieffenbach
should have known it was going to
be a bad day at the very outset
when the cold weather and soggy
court conditions forced the early-
morning match, originally sched-
riled for Trees Courts, indoors to
the Alpine Racquet Club.

“It’s not that we played badly,”
Dieffenbach contended. “We just
caught them on a good day. We
played well but not well enough to
win.”

The Panthers played well enough
to win yesterday, though, and the
sky was as cloudless as their
performance as they turned away
visiting Duquesne, 8-1, without the

     

services of freshman star Torn
Liebenguth.

Liebenguth was benched be-
cause of disciplinary actions but he
should be in the lineup for today’s
match at California State.

Mike Habbel took over Lieben-
guth’s number-one position and
promptly defeated Ed Neal in
straight set, 6-2, 6-3. Panthers
Kevin Quay, Harry Habbel, Tom
Gault, Chuck Brand, and John
Girty also defeated their respective

, opponents in straight sets to give

Pitt a 6-0 lead going into doubles
action.

Duquesne’s lone victory came
when Neal and Jeff Weisband
teamed up to edge by Harry
Habbel and Gault, 6-3, 0-6,
7-6—winning the last game with a
tie breaker.

In the meantime, Quay and Girty
beat Mark Lerch and Don Randall,
4-6, 6-2, 7-6, while Brand and Jeff
Gordon defeated Mark Anderson
and Dave Hamilton, 6-3, 6-1—to
sewing things up for Pitt.

The Panthers have .three
matches within the next week
including a home match against
Robert Morris on May 2 at 2 p.m.
Hopefully the weather will be good.

Muro Seconds Duffers

By JOHN FINN

With three regulars out of
action, substitute John Muro came
off the bench to shoot an 80 and
lead the Pitt golf team to a
second-place finish in a triangular
match with Clarion and Robert
Morris yesterday, at Green Oaks
Country Club.

The Panthers registered a 414,
just 10 strokes behind the.winning
team from Clarion and 12 strokes
ahead of the last-place team from
Robert Morris.

Aside from Muro, the Panthers
had an off day. Alan English, who

usually shoots in the low 80s soared
to an 85 while Jim Fitzsimmons
shot an 81 which Pitt coach Steve
Petro claimed was three or four
strokes higher than his average.
Jim McGrath, the freshman who
had been playing so superbly last
week, managed to shoot an 81
despite feeling under the weather.
In addition, Mark Halligan shot an
89 for Pitt.

Petro had nothing but praise for
Muro, who was Pitt’s medalist.

We really didn’t expect John to
do that well,” he said, “but we
sure were pleased with his

Before you buy a deodorant tampon, read the“caut.ion" on the package. It
tells you to discontinue use and consult your physician if irritation develops or if
you have a history of sensitivity or allergies.

Now, ask yourself if you want to take this risk with your body.

There is no Warni

on aTampax tampon package

No wonder Tampax tampons are the #1

‘ You wont find any warning on theTampax
tampon package. A deodorant, or cover-up
scent, which may cause allergic reactions or be
harmful to delicate tissues is unnecessary. When
a tampon is in use, embarrassing odordoes not
form. So why take chances with something that

isnt needed?

Whats more, theTampax tampon container-
applicator—— like the tampon- is flushable and
biodegradable. Its as safe to dispose of as a few
sheets of facial tissue.You caritisay this about
plastic applicators. And unlike some other
tampons,Tampax tampons expand in all three
directions—length, breadth and width—-to adjust
to your inner contours so that the chance of

leakage or bypass is minimal.

performance. Based on yester-
day's performance, he will be
making the trip to Penn State with
us this weekend."

Petro noted his satisfaction with
the results of the match.

“Three of our regulars were
out,” he said, “and we still
finished second. I have to give a lot
of credit to all the players who were
able to participate."

The three Panthers who did not
play yesterday were team captain
Bill Burkardt, Bob Coury and
Kevin McCarthy. Burkardt is still
suffering from a virus. Coury has
returned home, and Kevin Mc-
Carthy was not able to attend. In
addition, Bruce Stephen is not yet
eligible.

“I think Bill (Burkardt) might be
able to play this weekend,” Petro
said, “and I am hoping Bruce
(Stephen) will be eligible too. With
these two guys, I think we will fair
much better."

Pitt travels to University Park
this weekerd for the Penn State
Invitational, the-biggest event of
the year for the Panthers. The
16-team match, which includes
West Virginia, Colgate, Rutgers,
Gannon and -Cornell. is considered
by many to be one of the best in the
east.

After two matches next week,
Pitt concludes its spring season
next weekend at the Indiana
Invitational.
