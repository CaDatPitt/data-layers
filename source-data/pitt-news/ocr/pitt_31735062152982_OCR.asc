A Uses Stanislavski Technique

With Role

Gulliver Allen.” According to
Engel, Gul1iver’s role "requires a
great deal of acrobatic ability.
‘Allen, who is considered by
critics to be.quite adept at what
he does, is nevertheless, very
deﬁcient at the basic fundamentals
of acting according to Engel. The
Players are instituting a series of
lessons ’for him in the Stanislavski
acting technique of emotional
memory.
Gulliver Is A Dog
“Although Gulliver seems to be
quite a specialist in diﬁicult roles
as this one assuredly is,” Engel
continued, “to play a monkey is
going to be quite a stretch for a
canine.” V
The Players are hoping, how-
ever, that the small black and
white mongrel terrier, with
amazing acrobatic ability and
increasing mastery of acting
techniques, will be able to fill
the role, since there are no mon-
keys in the immediate area.
Free tickets to see Gulliver in
his performances tonight through

Student Body Favors Finals
Week; Ccnsures Scheduling

By NANCY DELANEY

Unbelievable th 0 u g h it
might seem, the administra-
tion and the students do
agree about something —
ﬁnals’ week. They’re both in
favor of it.

The only big problem with
ﬁnals‘ week, besides nervous
strain according to the majority
of students interviewed, is
scheduling. Finals’ week looks
ﬁne on paper, where you don‘t
have to contend with real peo-
ple, but in action, they claim, it
is often inefﬁcient and inef-
fectual.

Despite ‘their strong support
of the present system, these
students are quick to censure
it in its details. Joseph Grief, a
junior in accounting, summar-
ized the main complaint by say-
ing, “It‘s a fine system — if only
the professors would stick to it.”

Another major complaint is
the arrangement of ﬁnals
within the week. Too many
are given in one day. or the
times are inconvenient, or
they're all given the ﬁrst two

days of the week, some stu-
dents complain.

Stuart Me:stetlman, a junior in

such a way that she missed

Projects Slated
To Help Students
From Hill District

The “Pittsburgh Volunteers” an-
nounced today it is accelerating its
effort to aid Hill district students
with the immediate formation of
the Hill Education Projects. The

projects are slated to start the end

of this month and student volun-
teers are needed now.

Volunteers will work four hours
a week in the Hill area tutoring
high school students. The students
and University tutors will meet in
the three community houses‘ on
the Hill.

A spokesman for the group said,
“We; need volunteers to help these

students during the summer. Some
of the help will be of the remedial
variety in the traditional subjects
for the student going back to high
school in the fall. Some help will
be given to the student preparing
for college. Those interested in
helping should call extension 7139,
orpwrite to 208 Schenley Hall.”
Volunteers will have the oppor-
tunity to develop one to one re-

-lationships with those they tutor.
@In_f0rmed sources indicated that
‘ Hill students may come down to

the campus for tutoring.

The_ diet of shoe leather came about when we put our foot
in our mouth and said the Panther b_aseball_team should have
gone to the NCAA District 2 baseball playoffs rather than
Penn State. V . _

p Crow -_ the traditional meal for poor forecasters ,— was
eaten in abundance after Penn State swept through the
District 2 playoffs like Chateaugay would whip a collection

. of plow horses. ’

1.5.;-.

.—s..-,,.v_

>lC‘\ "1,

 

. We were totally wrong about Coach Chuck Medlar’s
Lions. They proved beyond any doubt that they belonged
in the tournament. , , ,_
, But the Way the Lions swept the tourney could not help
but make -one" think’ that Pitt still belonged. Not in Penn
State’s place, but instead of one of the other three teams --
Rider, Temple or_ St. Johns. A
, Bob Fenton pitched a no-hitter for Penn State when they
won the ﬁrst game of the playoff, 7-0, over Rider. Dick Noe
pitched the Lions to an 11-2 rack over St. John’s the follow-
ing day. . I .
Fenton is an outstanding pitcher, and he may be
better than the Panther’s John Carlisle. But, if Fenton
could no-hit Rider, Carlisle could have at leastbeaten
them. We have no choice but to think that Bobby Lewis’
crew could have handled Rider quite easily if they were
invited to the playoﬂs. ,
~ St. John’s obviously had the same malady we accused
Penn State of-having" ——‘ a one man pitching staff. The Red-
men’s leading pitcher .— along _with _Fenton —- made the
District 2 all-star team. But,‘judging ‘fromthe score of the
ﬁnal game, St. John’s had no one to’ go along withtheir ace
hurler. - ' _ - ' V _

All this leads us to the conclusionthat the Panthers may
not have been able to beat ‘Penn State, but they certainly
deserved a spot in -the tournament. _ _

We were not the only one who Penn’State_ made look bad.

A Pitt student — ‘James S. Burkes -— blasted "the committee

for its selections in a letter to the student -newspaper at
State 4 The Daily Collegian. , p _

In the letter Burkes said, “As long as petty college senti-
ment outweighs the principles of justice and impartiality
among the members of the « National Collegiate Athletic As-
'sociation,fthe NCAA baseball playoﬁs ‘will remain a farce.”
In case Mr. Burkes cares to stop "up, we have plenty of -crow
left over. _ . _. .

The comparison of Carlisle and Fentoniis an interesting
one. Bobby Lewis‘ calls Carlisle‘ the best pitcher he ever
coached. But as brilliant as Carlisle was this year, Fenton’s
record was even better. , V

Carlisle has a 7-1 record with a 1.16 earned run aver-
age. Fenton, prior to the College World Series, was 10-1
with a ‘fantastic 0.96 earned -run’ average. He ‘also pitch-
ed against stronger opposition than Carlisle did. _

But statistics don’t always tell the story. A West Virginia
baseball player, who has faced Carlisle and Fenton, said that
Carlisle is by farthe better pitcher. _ g ' ,

Major league scouts may clear upthe issue shortly. The
majors will express their opinion of who is the best byway
of money .——. something that always talks louder than words.
Whichever one gets the largest bonus will," apparently, in
the leyes of the major league teams be the most promising

ur er.
