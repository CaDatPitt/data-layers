yesterday by .Bob Grienwahn, business manager of Festival.

Tickets will be distributed with only identiﬁcation andsig-
nature required as security by Frances Rose, secretary in the
oztﬁce of the dean of men. They may be exchanged for an IOU
by any student veteran who will not otherwise be able to at-
tend the Festival events because his monthly check has not
arrived. - . K .

Although it is probable that Pitt veterans wﬂl receive
their checks by the end of this week, the downtown oﬁice of
Veterans administration announced that checks not received
before Monday may be delayed 7 to 10 days.

The bill appropriating funds to the VA is scheduled for
presidential signature today but it will be several days before
the appropration works through government channels to pro-
vide the VA with the necessary funds to ﬁnance all subsistence
checks.

Spring Festival was neverlike this. ,

It’s been years since a name band played at a Pitt dance.
Something different for a change. It's also been years since
the ﬂoat paradevvas an honest-to—goodness “ﬂoating” parade.
During the War, the"‘ﬂoats” were grounded. Yes, this year’s
festival committee has gone all out to give Pitt students a Week
' of festivities that they will long remember. .

1 The‘ festival does not need to be sold to the student body.
It sells itself. Unanticipated, hoWever,‘was this newest develop-
ment, inthe paying of subsistence to veteran students.
' VVe said before that there ‘were many changes in this
years festival. The latest addition is more. than a novel one.
, It seems that the recent trouble in Washington over the
paying of subsistance checks to veteran students may throw into
a.fta.ilspin all the work ‘and planning that many hundreds of
- students have. already put into the coming Festival, But de-
termined to give everyone the opportunity to go to all events
, come heat or high water the festival committee, in conjunction
with the dean of men ’s oﬂice, has devised a credit plan. Cer-
H tain that this interruption in payment is only temporary, they
- are arranging an IOU system so that students will not miss
~..tl1e biggest socialevent of their school year, in case an emer-
gency arises. The front page box tells the story in detail, where
to go, who to see, what to do. Be sure to read it.
Truly, festival was never like this.

Navy Flycrs Form

Training Reserve

Nearly 150 former Naval Avia-
tion personnel met in the Navy
Recruiting ofﬁce, Old Post Office
building, April 21, to form a Vol-
unteer Naval Aviation Reserve
unit. ’

The purpose of the unit is to
maintain training and interest in

.Naval Aviation until the Navy is

able to establish an aircraft base
at a local airport. Since there are

no Naval Air facilities in Western,

Pennsylvania, ﬂight training will
be limited to those days when the
Navy will ﬂy aircraft here from
Columbus or Philadelphia.

There are openings in the unit
for all rates and ranks of Naval
Aviation personnel, and those in-
terested are requested to inquire
at the local Naval Recruiting of-
ﬁce. The Navy guarantees for
each recruit a two-week training
period a year either on a carrier
cruise or at a Naval air station.

ood,”

By Ursula. Halloran
To say the least, we were well chaperoned. And necessarily so.
The wolves of Hollywood and Vine are no myth--I think we even

had a few in our party.

My favorite brunette was my roommate, Chicago’s Jean Devon.
She and- I lived with one of the chaperones. Spotted ezfrly as un-
stable characters, no doubt. Jean was chosen by the Chicago Times

from 4000 photos and because of her

week job as Vocalist with Don
McGrain’s band in the Boulevard
Room of the Stevens hotel.

Some of the bruns became pub-
licity-wise overnight. Paramount
had a barrage of cameras on us
pretty constantly and a few would
elbow each other, ﬂing up a hand
to wave or put on a ﬂoppy-brim-
med hat ——- the idea was to cover
someone else’s face.

Three of us were representing
colleges and took quitea beating
because of it. Miss Seattle, about
37 and mother of 3 children, told
me daily that the runner—up in
her contest had been a “collitch”
girl. ,

Calonna Struck With Bags

Long—legged f‘Texas.” was prob-
ably the most clothes-conscious of
the group. «Jerry Calonna, who
portered her bags in Kansas City

at 2 a. In. one morning, found
himself with ten pieces of luggage

and seven hat boxes on his hands.
Houston had gifted Mary Ellen
Fields with. a thousand dollars for
her wardrobe and she had gone
wacky in Hartzfeld’s Petticoat
Lane.

Elaine Petrillo, Rosetta Monica
and Ann Treppedi "of New York,
chosen by Macy’s basement, Wal-
green’s Drug and ’ the Bronx,
formed a clique which never
broke up. I heard Boston's‘ Betty
Marlin the night of the Super
Chief wreck wishing she had
never left home. She ,was very
homesick for her husband--- wept
the whole -night out from N .Y. on

V-6 Recruits
On Campus

“Navy V-6, inactive and or-

pus last week as a program that
is a real deal,” stated Dr. Russell
Ferguson, as he explained the ad-
vantages of V-6‘ for college men

with atleast a sophomore stand- '

ing. . ,
Dr. Ferguson will handle the
information bureau work for V-6

- and will act as procurement and

recruiting officer. .

Advantages of V-6: Join at the
highest rate ‘you held; no drills,
no duties; longevity; no physical
examination; you may volunteer
for either summer or winter cruis-
es; and you will never be called
to active duty without your con-
sent, except in a National Emer-
gency.’

“Best of all,” claimed Dr. Fer-
guson, “is that you may .. be re-
leased at any time on your own

request.” * I

The two V-6 programs, com-
pletely inactive and partial par-
ticipation with the training pro-

get spring fever at the same time, something’s
bound to happen._ At Pitt we, call it Spring
Festival.

This is the time when we push our books
into a corner and swing into the dizzy whirl
of spring activity. During Festival Week, we
go to the carnival Tuesday night, even though
We have a poli. sci departmental Wednesday.
We have ourselves a time at the Saturday ball,
without giving a thought to that 1500-word
term paper tha:t’s due first hour Monday morn-
ing. Nobody, not even a professor, thinks about
tests, papers, or homework.

This happy state of affairs all started back
in 1931, when Pitt Week, an old University
custom, was revived under the new name of
Spring Festival. The ﬁrst year’s festivities

consisted of nine events, including the Festi-V»

Promising to betthe happiest (because classes will be dis-
missed at 10:30 a. m.) and the busiest day of the week, Friday

is packed with six large events.

At 11:30 a. m. on the Soldier’s and Sailor’s Memorial plaz

is the annual Tap Day, when outstanding students will be hon-
ored by the various campus. honorary fraternities. Following
this ceremony, tappees attend the Honors Day luncheon in

the University club at 12:30 p. m.
Krupa Brings Down Curtain

The rest of the afternoon is set for heavy competition be-
tween sororities in the Float parade at 2:30 p. m., fraternities
in the track meet at 3 o’clock, and both social organizations
in the Sweepstakes’ at 4:30 p. m. The second showing of the
Pitt Player’s “Joan” is scheduled for 8:30 p. 11).

With a grand ﬂourish, Gene Krupa and his orchestra, Mischa

Leading Students

The crowning of this year’s leaders and the
recognition of next year’s leaders ﬁll out the Tap
Day program scheduled for Friday morning, May
9, at 11:30 o’clock, on Soldier’s and Sailor’s me-
morial plaza. ,

A University tradition since the early 20’s and
now a part of Spring Festival week, Tap Day
provides a time and place for honorary awards.

One of the highlights of the -event will be the

announcement of the senior awards,.Senio1' Queen, 0

Junior Worthies, is a 75-year-old tradition.
Tap Day ceremonies will conclude with an Hon-
ors Day’ luncheon for tapees in the University

while the women will be dressed
in charming Spring frocks and
ensembles.”

Hundreds of students flocked to
the festivities, including the sports
dance, where, as the Weekly
warned, “No track suits will be
allowed.” Apparently it wasn’t
“very warm for May.”

This first annual Festival set a
standard which committees of
succeeding years worked hard to
keep up, and better.

The 1942 committee resolved to
top anything that had been done
before, so they released a balloon
barrage from the tip of the Cathe-
dral. A complimentary ticket to
the ball was given to the person
who gathered most of the feather-
weight bombs. That year, stu-
dents voted ten popular songs
into the Pitt Hit Parade, which
was presented by Art Jarrett and
his orchestra at the grand ball.

1943’s “Fiesta Week,” high-
lighted by the “Baile Rhumba”
and the musical “Chi1e-Con-Car-
nival,” featured a South American
theme. Xavier Cugat appeared at
the Tuck shop one day, and was
made honorary chairman of the
we_ek’s events. Tap Day was Very
unusual that spring, since few
men were still around to receive
their awards. ' _ .-

Festival Ball Goe

The Saturday night dance at
the Hunt Armory will be the
largest Pitt dance ever held in

the history of the. University.’

Gene Krupa, who has one of the
best name bands in the country,
Mischa Auer, actor- comedian,
Bonnie Baker, Ed Lord and Alleg-
ra, and Freddie Shaffer’s all-girl
orchestra will provide a continu-
ous program of entertainment.

Hunt Armory, the largest en-
closed building In western Penn-
sylvania, is capable of holding
8000 dancers. Preliminary ticket
sales show 4000 to 5000 people
will be attending the dance.

The dance will begin at 8 p. m.
because of the unprecedented
amount of entertainment. Gene
Krupa, the main source of the
dance music for the evening, will
be playing sweet, dancable music
suited for the Pitt crowd.

Contract provisions with Krupa
call for a sweet dance, a 3-1, 2-1
ratio, all of which means that
there will be a series of three
sweet tunes, one production num-
ber which features Krupa on
drums, then two more sweet num-
bers and one jump.

  

Gene Krupa.

The size of the Armory, at Em-
erson and Alder streets, East End,
may be illustrated by the crowds
that have ﬁlled the place in the
past. Governor Dewey, in his tour
for president, addressed a rally
for 15,0-00 people there, while
many an indoor circus has been
held in the spacious building.

Krupa believa intensely in the

smooth type of musical entertain-A

Al-out in Lavish Specacl

ment" for dancing. Though his
fame originally was built on fren-
zied drumbeats, the baton wielder
is the ﬁrst to say that the era of
blatant swing is past. The result
now is a melodious combination
of novelty and smooth tempo
numbers.

“Not that the good jazz tunes
have gone,” sa-y.s Gene, “It’s still
a big thing, but at least 60 per
cent of the music bands play to-
day should be fashioned for danc-
ers. On many tunes which my
band plays, we stress ballad work
and pretty harmonies to the ex-
clusion of solo work by ‘instru-
mentalists, the rhythm section
blending into the melody as much
as the reeds and brass.”

Preparations for conversion of
the Hunt Armory into a danceland
are in the ﬁnal process of com-
pletion. Special danceﬂoor wax
has been sent from St. Joseph,
Missouri. The Duquesne Light
company and the Pittsburgh Fire
department have loaned the com-
mittee equipment to handle light-
ing problems. Fifty thousand dol-
lars worth of mammoth comic

rades and in Rosebowl games

Sports Editor
If you are at all interested in track and you happened to ex-
amine the results of the Penn Relays held last weekend, you found

that the Pitt thinclads didn’t make much of a splash. In fact-they
failed to place in any of the ﬁnals,

It wasn’t a pleasant discovery, to be sure, but what makes

it all the harder to take is the memory of the many Relays of
the past in which the Blue and Gold took top honors.

‘ The material at Pitt is still up to par and remains under the
reins of the same coach. But the life of a runner is entirely dif-
ferent.’ To represent Pitt on the track these days is to struggle.
And we use the word advisedly. L /
Optimistic Outlook

Take a short glimpse at the sad plight of the Pitt trackman.
Following ‘a so-so cross-country season, Mr. sprint and stride look-
ed forward enthusiastically to an outstanding track and ﬁeld cam-
paign. Thewordhad got around that old Carl Olson had assembled
the best track team in Pitt history. Interest was at a new pitch
but only untilithe first day of practice for the indoor season. After
that the fun and interest became a tortuous ordeal for those who

. cared to stick it out.  _
The always inadequate but yet proud trackhouse in which all

g Trees gym. The 22 lap mile track“.

of the long line of Pitt champions
had trained,’ was neglected so bad-

ly ‘duringthe war, that it lost ev-

ery yestige of its original -purpose
or» shape. Yet the fellows made
use of it during November ‘until
it no longer was ﬁt for human or

.. beast.

Running Dizzy
The , team then. moved ‘into

was commandeered“ for use A by
the Olsonmen. This they found
about at valuable as running
around one’s own bed room at

. home -- and every bit at interest-

ing. ,

A Though they tried desperately,
they ‘found the setup was.not con-
ducive to developing good run-
ning‘ shape. They soon found. that

there was not much to -look for-

ward to - no meets, no honors-—

only shin splints and blisters‘ ga-
lore.‘ And no help from the Uni-
versity was forthcoming.

But they didn’t quit.
For the Relays

A sudden ,, intensiﬁed effort on
the stadium track in the damp
‘spring air, pnoduced a bountiful
-crop of colds and pulled muscles
among most of the stars. In that
condition they challenged the ﬁeld
at the’Relays. Consequently they
were licked and (licked bad.

They still didn’t quit.

Tomorrow afternoon they take
on the Nittany-Lion of Penn State
who boast of one of the most for-
midable squads in the ‘East. They
don’t have much chance of win-
ning.

They won’t quit, , they
will. ~

Golf and Tennis Teams Seek
First Victories of Season

VFor the second straight week Pitt’s tennis and golf teams
take to the road for Saturday matches, the netmen traveling

of West Virginia. .
Both Pitt and State will be

looking for their ﬁrst tennis victo-

ry on Saturday. The Panthers

dropped their opener to the Army
Cadetslast week, 5-2. State was
thumped twice, losing to George-
town,_ 8-1, and Maryland, 6-3.

Dr. David O’Laughlin expects
to stick with the six men he used
against Army, namely Bob Bald,
Art Harmuth, Russ Campbell.
Jack Clinton, Jack O’Brien, and
Ivan Birsic, Stan Weil and Ira
Horne are pressing for regular
berths on the squad.

Starting with two veteran
courtsters, Captain Walt Stegner
and Dick Clarkson, Lion coach
Sherman Fogg has filled out the
six mansquad with Herb_Bech-
hard, Dick Greenwalt, Bob Tut-
tle of Pittsburgh and Frank Pes-
salano, with Ray Fink and Dave

to State college while the golfers are meeting the Mountaineers

Miller occasionally breaking into
the lineup. «

After absorbing a. terriﬁc lac-
ing administered by Penn State,
111/2-1/2, Pitt’s golfers will be try-
ing to come back and clip West
Virginia. This task will be a
toughbne for theSMounties boast
one of the best teams in recent
years.

Mike Krak posted a par 72 in
the 9-0 win over Waynesburg last
week. Other members of the squad
are Captain Don Hall, Jack Fefck,
Bob Coulson, Bert Davis, and
George Zatazeld.

The lin-ksmen have worked
hard this week at Shannopin
country club in preparation for
Saturday’s contest. The variabili-
ty of most of the players has de-
layed the ‘naming of those who
will make the trip to West Vir-
ginia on Saturday. ' '

Panther, Lion Nines
Meet in Two Game

Series At Stadium

Pitt’s traditional rival, Penn
State, has come to Pittsburgh to
meet the Panthers in a two-game
series. The teams will tangle at
the Stadium this afternoon at 3:30
and again tomorrow morning at
10 a. m.

Joe Bedenk’s Lions have been
riding a rocky trail’ of mixed
wins and defeats this season,’ so‘
the Panthers may, with good rea-
son, hope to sweep the series.
Particularly in ﬁelding the Staters
have been sloppy in spots. In a
two-game series with West Vir-
ginia, they committeed eight er-
rors and lost both games.

3 Rookie Ilitting .400

A shining light on the State
team, however, has been rookie
leftﬁeld-er Don Stark, who has
been socking the ball at a .400
clip. Otherwise, the team is made
up chiefly of veterans. ,

Coach Bedenk has moaned that
all the opposition teams have been
strengthened by freshmen, where-
as Penn State freshmen students
have been shipped to “farm”
schools in ‘order to relieve the
crowded conditions.

Bedenk may well have been
looking in the direction of Pitts-
burgh when he ‘made that com-
plaint, for Coach Mitterlin_g’s ros-
ter has been strengthened im-
measurably by freshmen Bob.
Rosfeld and Jackie Snyder. ‘

Gehrett Faces Calder

A dramatitrtinge may be-.add-
ed to the Pitt-State series if
State's Bob Gehrett is selected to
oppose Deryl Calder in a‘ pitch-
er's duel. Behind Gehrett’s hurl-
ing, the Lions handed Caldera 2-
0 defeat last season. Both pitch-
ers gave up only six hits.

Bedenk will likely use Gehrett
in one game and Ken Yountin the
other. Yount not only is one» of
his most effective hurlers, but a -
