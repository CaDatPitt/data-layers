LAURENC HURST. A
Dan Cupid is after big game these‘

days. His latest shot brought to earth ‘

one of the best men that 0' ever
graduated from the University of
Pittsburgh. Report has come to the
office of THE VVEEKLY that Lau-
rence Barrett Hurst, College, ’02,
Law, ’05, ex—graduate manager, and
prominent member of -the Alumni As-
sociation of the University, is. soon to
become a benedict. His engagement
to Miss Helen Hastings, daughter of
Mr. .and Mrs. J. M. Hastings of the
East End, this city, has just been an-
nounced. - 4 . g

During the time that Mr. Hurst was
in the University as a student, he al-
ways took an active part in the stu-
dent life, and was a prominent ﬁgure
in college life at that period. As a

graduate manager,‘he earned the rep— ‘
utation of being one of the best men ‘

that ever ﬁlled'the ‘position. Three
years after Laurence graduated from
the. college, he graduated’ from the
law department of the University and
has built up a good law practice.‘

THINK or OTII-IERAS

The attention of THE PITT
WEEK'LY has been called'1to the fact
that some student or students inithe
University have been,~ clipping the
newspapers in the.lib_rary. All the
daily papers are to be found each day
on the tables in the reading room or
library and they. are placed there for
the ‘beneﬁt of all the students that
wish to read them. It does not take
any great amount of thinking to see
that if a person comes in the library
and clips the papers—-that it takes out
somethingthat is of interest to him-—
-he is doing a great injustice to every
other studentin the University. 1t
stands to reason that if every man
that wanted to take something out of
the paper that was of interest to him,
there would soon be no whole papers

. left in thelibrary forpersons to read.

It is altogether likely that the per--
sons that are‘ doing the clipping at
the present tirne are simply doing it
from thoughtlessness, as no person in
the University is so narrow minded

7 that he is going to put every other

student in the University at a disad-
vantage simply for the sake of ob-
taining 'a clipping of a certain news
item that they are int’er.este,d in. We
believe that if the persons guilty In’
this offense will only stop a moment
to think of the harm that they are
doing, they will stop clipping the

' papers in the library. The m':1xin1un1

price of any paper in the City of
Pittsburgh is two cents, and surely if
a news item is worth clipping and sav-
ing, it is worth the price of the paper
Why put all the

disadvantage to" save yourself _ two
cents.’ ~We feel sure that if any stu-
dent can show that he is so hard up
that he cannot afford to buy a news»
paper from which he alesii-es to”. get a
news item, the Universirv authorities
would be glad to make some arrange-
ment ‘whereby he might secure the
article without robbing the .library.

 

CHEERLHEADERS ELECTED

Now that all the cheerleaders have
been elected, and -we believe that the
pres-ent set of men are the best qual-
iﬁed for the positions that have ever
‘been elected, we would like to see the

.men- get down to workfand make

good. From now'on until the end
of thebaske-t_bal1 season every cheer-

'leader should be at the games and

make things hum‘ all- through the
game. They. should be on hand at
the game to‘ be played at Washington
next‘ week, which will be one of the
most important of ‘the year., Then
when the_ basielball season *comes_
around they should ‘be on hand at
every contest and see that ,a goodly
amount of cheering is done. Besides
the job of cheerleader is not confined
to events of an athletic nature. Every
event that is of any -importance to the
University demands the. presence of
the‘ cheerleaders. A‘ man holding the
position of head cheerleader at Pitt"

should have-as date book of all the
_ events that are to beheld and see to
it that he and all his assistants are on‘
I, hand to do their work. Foninsitanee,

there is an intercollegiate debate to_—
night in Thaw,hall.* It is surely the
duty of\Clyde_ Hazlett and the men
that ‘havexbeen electedto help him to
be ‘i hand to-night and make the
"room ring with cheers for the team.
A good _reception will do a great deal
to make the men have conﬁdence and

win the victory from AlleghenyACol—'
‘lege. THE PITT WEEKLY is back,

of every ma! that’ holds a position as
cheerleader and earnestly desires that
the fellows show the students that
they have made no mistake in the se-
lections for leaders this year.

A « PROSPECTS BLRIGHT

That the University is at last to
come into its own in regard to an ap-
propriation from the State Legislature
is the ﬁrm conviction of all the mem-

bers of the delegation which , jour-»

neyed _to I-Iarrisburglast Tuesday to
support ‘the .bill lately introduced
calling "for an appropriation of $1,-
160,000 for maintenance and $600,000
for new buildings, providing th_e Uni-
versity raises an additional $600,000.

0 Never beforehave prospects looked

so encouraging at Pitt and never be-‘

fore has the University been boomed
up as uponthis trip. It is a source
of gratiﬁcation to all connected with
the University to notice the increase
in interest,w'hich the citizens of Pitts-
burgh and_ VVestern Pennsylvania are
exhibiting toward the University, and
we congratulate Chancellor McCor-
mick and his associates upon their
success‘. ‘ A '

‘Alumni -Council Meeting.

-The Alumni Council will hold its‘

first regular meeting of the year in
room 302 Tlhaw Hall (Engineering
building), Monday, March 17th, at 8
P. M.~ ‘ . '

It is desirable that all Councilors
attend ‘as afchairman will be elected
for the ensuing year, and the follow-
ing matters will be considered:

‘(l) The ‘changing of Article 11,
Section 3 of the Constitution, to read:
“Any graduate of the University of
Pit_ts_.burgh»may be elected a regular
member of this association on writ-
ten application approved by the sig-
natures of a majority of the six re —
ular, Councilors from his department,
and on payment of the dues.” Section
4 -concerning associate members to be
"modiﬁed in the same way.

(2) The changing of the election
By—laws so that nominations shall be
mad'e during -the month of December
and ‘ballots sent out on or before Ian-
uary 10th, same tobe returned on C1‘
before February 10th. The present
arrangement crow-ds the nominations
and election into three weeks and
makes the work of the Election Com-
mittee and Secretary exceedingly (lif-
ﬁcult., It is further suggested that
only graduates of a department vote
for departmental representatives, but
that all alumni may vote for Repre-
sentatives at Large. ' ~

(3) The Secretary’s’ recommenda-
tion made" at. the annual business
meeting,» that a permanent secretary
be appointed who shall give his entire
time to the -association, the idea being
to have him visit alumni,
them in the association and the-Uni-
versity, take care of, alumni publica-
tions, reunions, form ‘local sections ‘in
various -parts of the country, organize
graduating classes, organize aluimniin

DENTAL - NOTES,

The students of the Dental College
showed their interest in’ their new
building in a‘ very materialistic way

last week by employing a painter to ‘

clean and. decorate the walls_of the
This is the one

but a few thoughtless -fellows
made the walls unsightly by throw-
ingremains of their lunch and stain-
ing the walls. . ' '

‘It seemed that this condition pre-

vailed in spite ofthe mandates of the ..

faculty to abstain from all throwing
in the building.

The StudentiSenate then took up
the matter, and after some’ consid-
eration employed C-has. T. Stough-
ton Company to clean‘ the walls» and
paint them. The coloris old gold
with ‘a blue border. The students are
very proud of their rpom, .and exer-
cise ever precaution to‘ keep it spot-
less. _

The expense of this work was ‘met

by an assessmentiof ten cents, which
the Senate laid on each student.

The members of the Senate are as
follows: A. L. Lewis, ,G. W. Stathers,

The hearing was ‘held in the cham-
ber of the Appropriations Committee,
more than'l«00 members‘.of th_e dele-
gation, friends of the University from
all parts of the state, state senators
.and members of the House from Alle-
gher1,y County, being in attendance.

S. Taylor North,’chairman ‘or the
committee, opened the proceedings
shortly after 4 o’clock. After the

‘clerk~had read therbill appropriating

$1,160,000 for operation and mainte-
nance of the University-during the
next two years, and "setting aside
$600,000 for permanent buildings,’pro-
viding the University raises $600,000
b'y,su‘bscription, Chancellor McCor-
mick took the floor. He spoke of the
needs of the University and stated
that the appropriation asked for was
only ‘a fraction ‘of what was really
needed. . He outlined the drawbacks
which the University is working’ un-
der and started that only the 'State
could give the desired help.

Following Dr. McCormick, live

‘ minute talks were given by Dr. H. E.

Friesell, dean of,the College of Den-
tistry; Dean W. G. Chambers‘ of the

’ School of Education; S. A. Taylor of

the School of Mines; Dr. Oscar Klotz

with the reception accordedthem and
by the attention given by the co-m-
mittee to the arguments and all feel
that Pitt .'will be well cared for when

J? G. Quick, president of ‘the asso-
ciation, said at therclose of the first
paign:

“I am mor
work that has been done up to the
present time"and think that before the
close of th mpaign that the mem-
bership"of t e association will -be at
least trebled. We have taken up the
matter in a systematic manner and
every man in the University will be
approached on the question and we
will be able to tell the number of men
that areiinterested in any wayin the
work of. the association in the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

Next Monday morning the Y. M. C.
A. will ‘hold a reception to the new
members and all the students of the’

\University are invited to attend this

meeting. Several of the student
Workers of the association will make
short talks on ‘the work that is being
done in the University and other
places by~the Y. M.t_C. A. It is de-
sired that every man that is able .to

be at the mee_tin‘g come out _and wel- ‘

come thenew men that have been en-
rolled during the week.

At the close ofthe meeting cards
were given out to the members pres-
ent and the various departments of
the University were assigned to com-
mittees for canvassing. Reports from
the canvassers indicated that the

membership" had’ been doubled by.

Tuesday and members were still being
added in great numbers. It is hoped
that ibyrrext Monday the association
will have grown to the greatest size
in its history.

 

ECONOMICS “FRESIC-I”. '

HAVE BANQ_UE’l‘_

 

Every Freshman ofithe School of-

Economics agreed that the ‘banquet of

‘last Friday was the event of the year

for them. The spirit manifested was
of the “bubbling” variety. Every man
responded with some appropriate ex-
pression of their pleasure in being an
“Economics Fresh.” Prof. Kidd was
present and made ﬁn kenthusiastic
speech. Later Prof. loc en came in
and responded. A letter was read
from Dean Holdsworth, who was un-
able to be present on account Of.sicl<—
ness, expressing his regret .at his in-
ability to attend. F
Spontaneous yells were indulged in
at. the psychological moment, led by
Scott M. Conway, the new assistant
cheer leader. .“Turk” Steen acted as
toastm.aster like a veteran, and tlhe
whole affair» was pronounced a e-
ci'cled success. There is a movement
to inaugurate a—series of informal
luncheons among the freshmen as, a
result of the banquet.

“_NEVERSWEA.TS” AND
“SKULLCRAGKERS”,
LENGACIE IN BATTLE

Ther was some battle on the floor

Eymnasium last Saturday after-
noon when the “Neverswe'a1'.s” and -the
“Skullcrackers,” teams -composed of
the original basketball talent of the
University, fought forhonors. \/Vhat
was. the score?’ Well , to tell the.
truth, no person knows [what ‘the "ﬁnal
result was. One man. says ne thing
and another man says atfotﬁer thing,

and you are unavbleito believe any one. .

It sufticeth to~say that if the‘ referee,
“Peggy” Haines, formerly. of the
Central League, had not called off
hostilities at the precise moment that
he did there would be very few of the
combatants living to tel1,the tale of
the roughest contest that is recorded
in the annals of the University. As
it'was one man is going around at
t'he present time with a Iipthat is
about three times the regulation size
and another has.his-nose scattered all
over his face in a manner that is not
altogether artistic,'while all the re-
maining veterans have scars of more
or—less merit." .

It was decided at the start that the
time of the halves would :be.' thirty-
ﬁve minutes in length, but after the
ﬁrst half was over ‘it was decided that
ten minutes would be enough for‘ the
remaining portion of the" agony. The
game had but
Fryorlof the “Neversweats” imistook
one of his own men, Lloyd, for one
of the enemy, and forthw-ith rammed
his head halfway through, Lloyd’s
jaw, before he realized that he was
murdering one of"his own players.
Time was-taken while_Hunter John-_
ston gathered‘-up the fragments of the
injured player’s lipfrom the floor and
re;place‘d them rintheir proper places.
VV.alt Allen was the next victim, he
having his nose splattered all over his
face in a play through right tackle.
Every other’minute some'person was
injured more or less, but‘-not serious-

ly ‘enough to deserve hon.orableimen,-

tion in this story. . ,
‘ The game was exceptionally fast,
and, considering the fact thatnone of
the players ‘knew anything about
basket ball, was well playedand drew
ro_und after round of applause from
the spectors, both of whom were much
pleased. Both managers assertA‘that
as soon as themembers of their teams
have another battle to the bitter end. . V
