forum tomorrow afternoon at 12:30

o’clock at Heinz House on the topic,
“Three Dictators——Mussolini, Hitler

personal contacts with leaders of the
world have given him an insight into
the political, economic and social con-
ﬂicts of the people and nations of the
world. At Berlin, this summer, he
electriﬁed a, representative gathering
of German officials and leaders of
business and the professions by re-
buking the Nazis for their treatment
of Jews, Communists and Liberals
and challenging them to deny his
statements of facts.

Admission to the Inquiry will be by
ticket. These tickets may be procur-
ed at the YMCA hut or at the YWCA
office in Heinz House.

Dean Sieg Tells
College Assembly
About Education

Department Heads Introduced At
Acquaintance Meeting In
Memorial Hall

An audience of 500 heard Dean L.
P. Sieg explain “How to get an edu-
cation, even if you go to college,” in
the assembly for college -students at
Memorial hall Friday afternoon. Char-
acterizing the meeting as “the ﬁrst
of its kind” and one “without a band
or cheerleaders,” the speaker called
it a means of better acquainting stu-
dents with their instructors and of
discussing with them the purposes of

college. ’
Don Campbell, C35, representing
the College association, introduced

Dean Sieg, who in turn presented
heads of departments, seated on the
platform. After calling on each of
the professors to stand and “’identify
himself,” the College dean presented
his ideas of what a college should be.

“Few indeed of the world’s great
men have been college graduates,”
Dr, Sieg declared. “When you en-
tered college, you took the chance
that whatever spark of genius Y011
might have had would be extinguish-
ed during the four years,. Too often
college has become the repository of
information which was automatically
considered the last word. The desire
for new learning has not always been
fostered.”

The speaker added, “College has
fulﬁlled its highest function when it
has made you want to learn, to probe
deeply and independently into the
problems of your course. Only when
you have gone through four years of
this type of training have you become
truly educated.”

Saying that he would welcome sug-
gestions from students and student
groups in regard to curriculum
changes, “even if they are made in
the manner of “The Index,’ " Dean
Sieg showed his preference for meet-
ings with undergraduates when he
said, “We would, however, appreciate
it if you would come directly to us.”

The assembly was called by the
College association, whose chief func-I
tions until now have been sponsoring
two dances a. semester and carrying 011
a student loan fund from the dance
proceeds.

Sophomores Plan, But Fail
To Plant, Flower Gardens

Gardeners Foil Farmerettes When They Set Out Crocuses
And Tulips On Heinz House Hill

 

The sophomore women are having
a garden. Once this story might have
been headed “Sophomore Women
Plant Garden.” But alas! now it may
only be said that the sophomores are
having a garden.

A few weeks ago the garden com-
mittee chose the spot which they pro-
posed to beautify. It is a small rec-
tangular plot on the lawn in front of
Heinz House. While the grounds were
still frozen and hard, they induced
the gardeners to spade the plot they
had chosen.

Then the girls, enveloped in aprons,
armed themselves, with sprinkling
cans, small trowels, and spades and
marched up to Heinz House ready to
plant. There, to their consternation,
they saw their garden made up into
neat rows with each bulb already
tucked ﬁrmly under the soil, The

gardeners had misinterpreted their
orders, planted the bulbs, and foiled
all their plans for making their ﬁrst
garden.

However, the bulbs, 100 crocuses
and 100 tulips, were planted, Scrubby
looking though they were when plant-
ed, next April, at Easter, they’ll make
a ﬂamboyant showing on ‘Heinz House
hill.

By that time everyone will have
forgotten who planted them, and the
ﬂower garden will be pointed out with
pride as belonging to the sophomore
garden committee-—who planned it.

The ﬂowers are not just going to
grace the lawns—-there are going to
be bouquets and bouquets of red and
white tulips and yellow iris to make
Heinz House, the YW office, and the
dean of women’s office completely

transformed.

By Jack_ Sollinger
Sigma Delta ,Chi President

Tomorrow morning the ﬁrst illu-
minated map of the Pitt Campus will
be placed on sale by Sigma Delta
Chi, national professional journalism
fraternity. '

A preview of the map was offered
Pitt students lastnight when copies
were placed on all bulletin boards of
the campus.

The ﬁrst sale was made to Ray
Mc»Cune, chairman of student rela-
tions committee of Student council,
who Dlirchased the map from John D.
Paulus, editor of the News and sec-

The price is the lowest that has
even been set for; this type of ma.p.

At Cornell university a similar
style map sold for $1. The
University of Kansas and the

University of Kentucky maps were
priced at 50 cents. The Pitt campus
map embodies all the features of the
other maps plus a better grade of
paper and execution by a. nationally
known cartoonist, Cy Hungerford of
the Post-Gazette. It will be sold to
the student body for 15 cents. The
price is just enough to cover printing
and engraving costs. The small
proﬁt will be used to meet the organ-
ization’s expenses and aid the Sigma.

Dr, T. Z, Koo, of the \Vorld Student

and Christ in his native land, China,
at a joint meeting of the YM-YWCA
cabinets Friday afternoon.

Student questioning brought forth
the facts that the attitude of the illit-

one of indifference and that it is the
more conservative Chinese who re-
sent the introduction of Christianity.

Chinese college students are either
Christians or have no religon Dr.
Koo stated in regard to the stand of
the college youth of China on religion.

ii-‘hen asked why life is considered

Latest Statistics Reveal

Unchanged Business Level

 

Pittsburgh Business Review Reveals Coal And Steel

Among Industries To Show Increases

The level of general business ac-
tivity in the United States was
‘described as “approximately un-
changed” in the past four or ﬁve

weeks by the Pittsburgh Business Re-
view, monthly publication of the Uni-
versity bureau of business research.
Although many industries continued
curtailing operations through Novem-
ber and the ﬁrst two weeks of Decem-
ber, some increased operation, nota-
ble among these being the steel in-
dustry, the Review pointed out. Al-

dustry is deﬁnitely downward at this
time of year, the operating rate has
risen substantially. and, according to
Iron Age, reached 36 per cent of
capacity in the third week of Decem-
ber, the highest since October.

I

The new gold buying policy of the

 

national government has had a pro-I

iiounced effect upon those commodi-
ties which are sensitive to world
markets, the Review showed. After
the administration advanced the.buy-
ing price for gold from $34.01 an
ounce to $34.06 in the third week of
September, the prices of these com-
modities weakened. Wheat fell more
than eight cents a bushel; cotton fell
three-fourths of a cent a pound; and
the stock market also lost ground
after the middle of the month.

Early in November the federal re-
serve banks renewed purchasing
bankers’ bills; and after the middle
of November the amount bought in-
creased each week, so that total hold-
ings on December 13 reached $116,-
000,000. Although interest rates ad-
vanced in the early part of December,
they are still low.

Killing The Trolley Question
onus THE INFORMATION to the Pitt News
that Student council ’s committee on street car
fares has turned the problem over to a group of
men downtown. The stand of the committee seems
to be an effective manner to kill the trolley fare
reduction question on the campus and an obvious
If Student council’s

Dorothy

evasion of the entire affair.
own committee, representatives of the student
body, cannot lead the ﬁght for trolley fare reduc-
tions, then again student government as it exists
here throws itself open for additional criticism.

VVe begin to doubt now whether members of the
trolley fare committee of council really believe
such reduction can be effected. It is a. pity that
the committee cannot be composed of people who
really believe in the project upon which they are
working. The student body cannot accept any re-
port of the committee which obviously shows an
evasive and defeatist attitude.

The question of trolley fare reductions for stu-

dents is a student question. It has the support of
the students on the Pitt campus and of the cam-
pus publication. The ﬁght for trolley fare reduc-
tions should come from Pitt students, not clown-
Iown gentlemen, however sincere they might be
about the affair, who cannot truly represent the

Pitt student.

The City of Pittsburgh and its present council
‘will listen to the plea of Pitt students in a ﬁght. for
reduced trolley fare rates. The people of Pitts-
burgh chose members of a city council who are to
ﬁght for the things the public elected them to
ﬁght for. A concerted, sincere, student-led ﬁght
for trolley fare reductions will get the favorable
attention not only of Pittsburgh ’s mayor and coun-
cil, but of the entire population of the city in addi-
tion. If Pitt students want trolley fare reductions,
Pitt students ought to step out and ﬁght for them.
Relegating the question to a group of men clown-
town is admitting defeat at the onset.

What About The Independents?

ALL’S QUIET ON THE Campus Front so far as the

non-fraternity Alliance is concerned. At least, the
boys haven’t been doing a. great deal to show that they
intend to run a slate in the spring elections. Or per-
haps they have been subdied by Student council’s mas-
terful handling of the trolley fare question! ,

If the Non-fraternity Alliance expects to take part in
the spring election, now is the time to get started on
the campaign. Run-of-the-mine students on the Pitt cam-
pus are indifferent to campus politics. It will take un-
usual eﬂorts to jolt these satisﬁed ladies and gentlemen
out of their illusion that the present council represents
everything lovely in student legislative bodies. The
independent group had better get its machine rolling
before the first semester examinations come along.

The defeat of the Men’s Self Government association
project on the campus three years ago provides an ex-
cellent example of what a student voter will do. The
campus independents have a tough nut to crack, and
while they idly sit by and ponder about things, the pres-
ent regime continues to entrench itself.‘ Beating the
present political crowd will be anything but a ring-
around-the—rosey business. The boys are seasoned vet-
erans at campus elections, know every voter’s stripes,
and have that certain something that makes disinterest-
ed campus ladies and gentlemen cast a. vote in their di-
rection. In addition, they control many it campus po-
litical plum, in exchange for which they will take votes
at the campus polls this spring.

The Pitt News is sincerely interested in seeing the
growth of an independent group. The regime which has
controlled council for the past several years» has done
little or nothing. A good political ﬁght on the campus
will be relished!

‘ like a good idea . . .

Sherwood Eddy Back Again!

HE YMCA PRESENTS Sherwood Eddy tomorrow.
The YMCA has been presenting Sherwood Eddy for

the past four years. Sherwood Eddy is pretty good!

‘Whatever Sherwood Eddy says to Pitt students to-
morrow will, in all probability, have a tendency to be
dogmatic. Sherwood Eddy has been dogmatic for a. long
time. So convinced is this gentleman that what he
says is right and true, that his speaking tone has taken
the character of a righteous ‘trumpet blast. He is force-
ful, interesting, full of information, and his words ‘ring
sincere.
is a great speaker.

Sherwood Eddy will talk about dictators tomorrow.
Stalin, Mussolini, and Hitler are probably due for a
sound lashing. If Dr. Eddy hasn’t met these men per-
sonally at some ‘time or other, he certainly has met per-
sons near enough to them to obtain ﬁrsthand informa-

tion.
However, don’t take Dr. Eddy too seriously. He
doesn’t care to have you take him seriously. He is

mainly interested that something he might say will
make you take yourself and the world about you serious-
ly. He jolts your previous convictions, throws forth new
and confusing information, and keeps you interested
throughout the assembly.

The fact that the YMCA has brought Dr. Eddy to the
campus sl1ouldn’t scare away those liberal students who
might think that that fact means something. It means
nothing more or less than the YMCA knows a good
speaker when it hears one.

Dr. Eddy is a good man for every Pitt student to hear.
Don’t let his dogmatism get the best of you. Examine
the relation of his facts closely before drawing any

pretty good, too!

The Case Of Dad Pryor

HE CASE OF DAD PRYOR, Pitt's popular candy

man, is a sad one. The University asked Dad to
leave his candy stand on the seventh ﬂoor of the Ca-
thedral, adhering to some ancient statute or other which
allows only University organizations to maintain such
commercial projects. As a matter of “legality,” the Uni-
versity is within its rights and privileges. University-
property is University property and such statutes and
laws that have been made for its government should
be adhered to. But the case of Dad Pryor should have
been made an exception.

The ousting of Dad Pryor from his stand on the
seventh ﬂoor cannot be adequately defended with any
degree of conviction. On the surface it appears to have
been a hurried and miscalculated move, ostensibly in
support of University statute government, evidently a
move to place a University organization in Pryor’s sev-
enth ﬂoor stand.

ITTLE INFORMATION concerning the situation is

available. The fact remains that Dad Pryor is not
at his stand on the seventh ﬂoor, and as yet no one else
has claimed that spot. W’hatever margin of proﬁt any
University organization manages to glean from a stand
on the seventh ﬂoor, there will be little rejoicing that
it represents the ousting of a man who aided, but did not
hurt, the school. The middle of winter is a bad time to
be unemployed, but Dad Pryor has been used to it! It
would not have nulliﬁed the statute government of the
University to have allowed Dad Pryor to work out the
winter, nor would the paltry proﬁt that a University
organization will make during the rest of the year
have been missed had Dad been allowed to stay.

In all probability Dad Pryor will not be called back.
But students in the Cathedral will remember him as the
fellow who always wore a Panther coat, and gave ex-
cellent service at his seventh ﬂoor stand, staying at his
post long after young ladies at other University stands
had packed off and gone home in mid-afternoon. If Dad
can be brought back, he should be. If he isn’t, we hope
the winter won't be too hard for the old fellow.

Through A Window In Hell

I-TREE FRYING ‘SOULS in Hell
shivered and huddled closer to
the pit of ﬁery brimstone. It was a
bad night in Hell. A drizzle fell
through the pall of thick, yellow
sulphur fumes and soot that hung
over the place, fell sizzling on hot
ground, and the steam rose into the
dead air so that one could .see but a
few feet. The light of many ﬁres was
caught in the curtain, casting an eerie
glow close to the ground; ten feet
above it was thick black. The sizz-
ling of the rain on the hot rock was
loud enough almost to drown out the
groans and gnashing of teeth, so loud
that the three souls had to shout in
order to hear each other,

“What a. day!” shouted the First,
a long thin soul.

“What do you mean ‘day?’ ” de-
manded the Second, whose long hair
hung in strings over his shoulders.
“As if there was a. day here! It’s all
the same: day, night, hot, wet, steam-
ing, stinking."

gI‘iDi11g.” And the Third soul
wiped his red, watering eyes. At this
the First snarled and threw a rock

crouched. “Did I ever tell you how I
happened to come here?” he asked.

looked at the Third Soul. “I stood it
as long as I could. I remember it
well. It was in the evening. We were
Sitting around the kitchen table, eat-
ing pretzels, drinking beer, and argu-
ing in our usual friendly manner. And
when I got the best of him in the
argument, when he’ couldn’t think of
anything else to say he raised the
glass to his mouth, gulped a mouthful,
and licking the foam from his upper
lip, -said: ‘Cripes but You gripe me.’
At that word ‘gripe’ something inside
me let go. There was a heavy frying
pan on the stove. I mashed his skull
With that, and here I am. I thought
that perhaps I might be able to get
away from that word here."
sighed and threw another rock into
the Bit. “It was ‘gripe, gripe, gripe’
all day. At night the sentence rang
in my ears.”
6‘ HAT’S FUNNY,” mused the Sec-

ond. “Almost the same thing
sent me here. Only she said ‘whyunt-
chacumupan’seemessometime’once too
often, and it was a. paper knife that
I used,

The Third soul wiped his eyes with
the back of his moist hand and said
nothing. “Well,” they asked him.

“Well what,”

“How does it happen that you’re
here.”

“I don’t quite know, boys. On the

Last Day they looked in the Book and,

asked me if I was the guy who had
a new method for preventing hoard-
ing, and when I said that I was, they
sent me here.” ‘

It rained harder, and the sizzling
on the rocks was so loud that they
had to discontinue their conversation.

sue of the magazine to the alumni
today.

Alumni Rdcord
Under Saunders
To Appear Today

Hamor, Buckner, Maulsby Write
On Science, Education Aims,
Value Of Journalism

Today marks the first appearance of
the Pittsburgh Record, oﬁicial publi-
cation of the General Alumni associa-
tion, under its new editor, Don F.
Saunders, C29, and the second edition
as the official publication of the Alum-
ni association.

The object of the publication, ac-
cording to Saunders, is to develop a.
closer relationship between the alum-
ni and the University. To reach this
objective the new editor has contin-
‘led the D01iOy of the Record in hav-
ing the faculty and associates of the
University present articles in their
ﬁelds of work. ‘

“Argonauts of Science,” by VVi1liam
A. I-Iamor, assistant director of Mel-
lon institute, describes the ﬁeld of
industrial research that is being ex-
tensively developed at the University.
That the archtypes of our Industrial
scientist and his work are found in
the lengendary Jason and his Argon-
autic expedition, is the belief of Ham-
or. This idea is interpreted in the
frontispiece drawing by Jeannette
Shirk.

The guiding principles that have
been evolved by the School of Educa-
tion to meet new problems are dis-
cussed in the article, “The School of
-Education Studies Its Objectives,” by
C. A. Buchner, head of the division
of professional education,

An article that will stir up a great
deal of comment among alumni and
undergraduate students is that by
William S, Maulsby, head of the de-
partment of journalism, entitled, “Do
Journalism Students Learn Any-
thing?” a frank analysis of the value
of journalism courses.

The editor, in “Matters of Record.”
sets forth his hopes and ideals for the
Record.

In the “Pictorial Record” is a pho-
tograph of one of the University’s
early graduating classes, made re-
markable by “The gentleman on the
right with the handle bar mustache.”
Alumni activities are covered and
notes of the various activities of con-
stituent organizations and Pitt clubs
are recorded. A tribute to the late
Richard Beatty Mellon, by Edward R.

Committee Plans
Women’s Lounges

Decorations Include Paintings
Loaned By Art Department

Plans for the decoration and man-
agement of the Women’s lounges

were presented at a. tea last Thurs- ‘

day at Heinz House, given by the
women’s rooms committee of VVSGA
for the members of the hostess com-
mittee.

Rose Honig,‘Ed35, announced that
bulletin boards will be placed in the
lounges and that cards will be sup-
plied on which to print notices, Open
discussion was held after Miss Honig
had advanced this plan, and it was
decided that notices will remain post-
ed for no longer than a. week, in order
to avoid congestion, and that the
cards will be obtained from the
hostess present in the lounge. It was
also decided that one of the duties
of the hostess will be to prevent the
placing of too many cards on the
boards.

Other duties of the hostesses were
presented by Marguerite Bogaerts,
C36_ “The fundamental object in hav-
ing hostesses,” said Miss Bogaerts,
“is to make the lounges even more
congenial and comfortable than they
are now.” The hostesses who will be
present in the various lounges almost
every hour during the day, will be
identiﬁed by badges. Miss Bogaerts
also informed the meeting that the
ﬁne arts department has offered to
lend the committee several pictures
every week for display in the lounges.

Orpha Leighty, Ed35, chairman of
the women’s rooms committee, stated
that lounges will be open from 8:30 to
4 o’clock. After 4 o’clock permission
may be obtained to use the rooms
for committee meetings. Miss Leighty
also announced that the Alumni hall
lounge is now open.

After an open discussion tea was
served by the lounge committee.

Pitt Meuaces Lengthy Duquesne Victory String In Cage Game Friday

Carlson’s Men Eager To Avenge
Last Year’s One-Point Losses

V

Dukes Have Not Tasted
Defeat Since Start
Of Last Season

 

For almost an entire year there has
been brewing a deep-seated feeling of
rivalry between two of the ﬁnest col-
lege basketball teams in this section,
Pitt and Duquesne. Last year the
Panthers and the Dukes engaged in
two of the most heated battles in
Stadium ﬂoor record, and the Panth-
ers came off second best in both.
Both games were decided by one-point
margins, and if there is anything
tougher than to lose a game by a One-
point margin it is to lose two games
by the difference of a single point.
That is suﬁicient impetus for the Pitt
part of the rivalry.

On the Duke side, the Bluff cagers
are out to continue a ﬁne list of vic-
tories compiled in the last two sea.-‘
sons of play. Ever since the second
game of last season, when the West-
minster Titans handed them a set-
back in a tough battle, the Dukes
have never come out on the short end
of a basketball score. Coach Chick
Davies’ passers won 15 straight con-
tests to round out their last season,
and the victory over Valparaiso Sat-
urday night ran this year’s win list
to four straight, All told, the ‘Dukes
have not tasted defeat in their last
19 games, and the team they may well
fear worst is Pitt.

So far this year the strength of the
Duquesne team has not been ade-
quately tested to reveal any powers
or weaknesses. However, when a
starting ﬁve may be chosen from a
group of forwards such as Birch,
MacDougall, Feldman, and Murphy;
centers such as Brenner and Meyers;
and guards such as Reiter, Moore, and
Zerilla, it is bound to be a powerful
quintet. All but three of these men
saw action in the Pitt-Duke games
last year.

For the Panthers, who appear now
to have hit a winning stride, the en-
tire starting lineup will be made up
of players who took part in the two
heart-breaking losses of last year,

It cannot be said that the crowd
which will attend this year’s game
will be larger than the crowds of last
year’s contests, for it just isn’t pos-
sible to get any more people into the
stadium pavilion than crammed its
every nook, cranny, and rafter then.
One-half of the crowd will be cheer-
ing for the Dukes to keep up the}?
victory string, and the, other half will
be pulling for the Panthers to break
the Duquesne jinx. Doc Carlson and
his boys are ready.

Good, Taano Star E
In Friday Meet

Same Events Will Be Included In ,
Next Handicap Games

 

 

Walter Good, sophomore track star,
copped the honors in the ﬁrst of a
series of weekly track and ﬁeld hand-
icap meets which took place in the
track house. Friday afternoon. Good
was ﬁrst in the low-hurdles race and
in the broad jump. Eugene T3330
was close behind Good with a ﬁrst-
place in the shot put, a tie for ﬁrst in
the high-jump, and a third in the
broad jump, Four men tied for the
first honors in the high-jump event.

A substantial number of novices
were among the entries in the track-
house meet.

The weekly meets are being staged
as an incentive to University students
to enter at track and ﬁeld. The sec-
ond meet will take place Friday and
will consist of the same events run off
in the ﬁrst meet. All varsity perform-
ers are handicapped to a high degree
to offset their advantages of training.
For instance, Aviziemis who placed
second in the shot-put event, was re-
quired to heave a 16-pound shot while
the other entrants used anshot of the
12-pound variety. ‘

Pitt Beats Owls
To Tighten Grip
On League Lead

 

Panthers Star At Foul Line
In Fast And Rough Game;
Freshmen Win Farce

In an evening of basketball whhci
was faintly reminiscent of a. three-
ring circus consisting of the players,
the officials and the game itself,
Pitt’-s Golden Cats tightened their
grip upon ﬁrst place in the Eastern
Intercollegiate conference by downing
the Temple Owls, 3'5-30, Saturday
night at the stadium.

Pitt held the upper hand for prac-
tically all of the contest and played
a steady and heady game most of the
way. The Owls were equally concern-
ed with the officials as with the Panth-
ers, and their teamwork suffered
somewhat as a result. Dr. -C-’ar1son’s
boys really won the game at the foul
line where they exhibited a. rem-arka-
ble regularity in making good on their
penalty shots, sinking 17 out of 21
attempts. The Owls missed nine free
throws in 23 opportunities.

Skip ‘Hughes was the big gun in the
Panr.her’s opening attack as he reg-
istered eight points in a rapid succes-
sion. It was largely Hughes’ work
which gave Pitt a 17-12 lead at the end
of the ﬁrst half. It was this same ﬁve-
point margin which spelled victory for
the locals at the close of the contest.
Skip banged in ﬁve more points in the
second half to gain high point honors
for the evening with a total of 13. Fox
was best in the visitors’ point-getting
with two ﬁeld goals and ﬁve fouls for
a total of nine,

Outstanding for the Owls was the
work of Jimmy Brown, center, one of
the smallest pivot men seen on the
local floor in years. Brown played a
beautiful ﬂoor game and managed to
hold his rival, Cribbs, to one ﬁeld goal.
Roderick again proved a sparkplug
in the Pitt offense when he entered
the game and scored two ﬁeld goals
and two free-throws:

The game was a rough one, and a
total of 34 personal fouls were called
on both teams. The officials were in
hot water from the beginning, and on
several occasions the spectators sided
with the Temple players in their ex-
hibtions of moaning.

If it was conﬁdence that the Pitt
freshman basketball team needed, it
certainly got a huge dose of it in the
preliminary game Saturday. The little
Panthers walloped a local aggrega-
tion known as the Siegals by a 38-3
margin. The losers failed to score
until the closing minutes of the sec-
ond half, and it was a ﬁne evening for
the 13 freshmen who saw action in the
farce.

Panther Swimming Team

Faces Difficult Schedule

Coach Pat Corr assigned the varsity
freshman swimming teams rather
stiff workouts in the ﬁrst practice in
two weeks.

The practices for the next two
weeks after the session will be some-
what lighter to make sure that the
entire squad is in the best physical
condition for the coming meets.

Although no deﬁnite date has been
set as yet for an AMA meet, the of-
ﬁcials are planning one for the latter
part of January, possibly on the 27th.
This means that the Panther swim-
mers will compete in ﬁve swimming
meets in as many weeks. After the
AMA meet Coach Corr’s team will
meet Ohio State, Delaware, Carnegie
Tech, and Franklin and Marshall on,
successive week—ends. The meet with
Ohio State which was originally set
for February 3, was moved back one
-day to February 2. The other schools
will be met as scheduled: Delaware,
February 10; Carnegie Tech, February
17; and Franklin and Marshall, Feb-
ruary 24.

Ice-Hockey Team
Considered Here

 

Hagan Requests All Candidates
To Report Soon At Stadium

 

Announcement has been made by’
James Hagan, graduate manager of
athletics, that the University is seri-
ously considering plans for an ice-
hockey team. This sport is rapidly
gaining favor in collegiate circles and,
according to Hagan, Pitt is not ad-
verse to sponsoring a, team.

At present, the authorities are in-
terested in learning what will be the
attitude of students here toward the
sport and how many men will be will-
ing to compete on such -a University‘
team.

-Hagan has requested that any boys
who are at all interested in participat- ‘
ing in this newest Pitt athletic vent-i
ure report at the Stadium office any
afternoon after today. It is urged
that these hockey aspirants. report as
soon as possible in order that deﬁnite
plans may be drawn up for a team and
schedule in the event that sufficient
interest is shown. »

Up to now there is no hockey team
at any of the local colleges or univer-
sities, although a Pitt, Tech and Du-
quesne league is being considered.

ROTC Honorary
Taps Four Men

Ceremony Performed At Dance
At Webster Hall Friday

Four seniors were tapped into
Scabbard and Blade, honorary ROTC
fraternity, at its dance for advanced
corps students in the Georgian room
of Hotel Webster Hall, Friday even-
ing. The men tapped were Lorenzo
Craig, .Ir., E34; C. A. -Conlin, E34;
John Lazure, E34; and M. L, Rutter,
E34.

The ritual was performed in the tra-
ditional Scabbard and Blade manner.
Actives drew up in double ﬁle before
the orchestra with William Havlak,
E34, captain of the chapter, in front
and Paul Hykes, E34, at the rear.
Tappees then stepped forward to meet
Htykes who presented them to Hav-
lak. At the end of the ceremony they
passed under an arch of sabers formed
by the actives.

More than 65 couples attended the
affair, dancing to the music of Jack
Logan’s orchestra. E F, Haverty,
C34, was general chairman of the
dance.

Wrestling Team
Continues Drills

Candidates Prepare For Team
Trials Set For January 27

The wrestling squad, headed by
Captain Bradford Ilsley, has
rapidly rounding into condition by
working out daily in the Stadium.

In four of the eight weight divisions
Coach Sutherland has two Allegheny
Mountain association champions, one
runner-up in a championship match,
and a veteran 165-pound wrestler in
Arthur Willets, competing for team
berths.

Norman Evans holds one AMA
championship, the Junior 118-pound
title, and Captain Ilsley is the holder
of the Senior AMA 135-pound title.
Paul Hinchberger ﬁnished in second
place in matches for the 125-pound
championship. Arthur Willets gained
considerable wrestling experience on
last year’s team. If past experience
means anything, these four wrestlers
should go a long way.

None of the team positions will be
deﬁnitely settled until after the team
tryouts, which will take place on Jan-
uary 27, Trials will be conducted in
eight weight divisions,

Thus. far this season the Dukes are

in the playing of Roderick, Noon, and
some of the others has helped the
Panthers no little. Add to this the
natural ﬁghting spirit of any Carlson

Statistics

Here are some statistics as com-
piled by that demon statistician, the
Campus Scout. In the ﬁrst half of
the Pitt-Temple game, Pitt took three
shots from beyond the foul line and
made one. W. Hughes made the one
ﬁeld goal and McCamant and Cribbsg
missed one apiece. From inside thel
foul line the Panther took 11 shots
and made three. On three of the shots
missed, the shooter was hacked and
received foul shots. ,
In the second half »C-ribbs took two):

ed both. From inside the foul line
the Panthers took 12 shots and made
ﬁve of them. Cribbs made his only
try for a ﬁeld goal from inside the
foul line.
Pretty good shooting we calls it,

.More Padding

Much comment has been heard at
the basket ball games this year re-
garding the need for more padding;
at both ends of the Stadium basket-
ball ﬂoor. Numerous times this year‘
players have crashed into the stone
wall at one end of the ﬂoor and into
the steps at the other end. Thus far,
fortunately, there have been no seri-
ous inJuries. However, there is a
good chance that if more padding is
not provided, someone may be serious-
ly injured.

Randour, Pitt Halfback,
Marries McDonald Girl

The marriage of Hubert Rgandour,
C36, a halfback on the football team,
and Margaret Laverne Cepak, C37, was
revealed last week. Miss Cepak and
Randour are both from McDonald,
Pennsylvania.

Randour saw quite a bit of action.
on this year’s football team and is
coisidered a good bet for a starting
assignment on next season’s varsity.
