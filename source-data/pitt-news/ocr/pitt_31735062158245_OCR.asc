Paul Palombo, public relations director of WPGH, explained

that the broadcasts would be beamed through power lines
it necessary, for over thirty '
girls to move.

The girls were offered two al—
ternatives by the University. They
could either move to the Nurses

Residence or to Brackenridge
House, if vacancies existed.

Some of the girls, rather than
move out of the sorority houses,
moved to other floors. The third
floors may still be used for stor-
age, and baths on the floor may
be utilized.

Three houses are seriously
considering improvements to
meet the requirements of the
ﬁre department by 1959-60,
while two others, the Alpha
Delta Pi and Delta Delta Delta
houses, will be torn down. The
remaining houses, which have
not yet reached any deﬁnite con-
clusions, must decide whether or
not to stay open.

Plans are being formulated
rapidly for a more permanent sol-
ution for the sororities. Eventu-

' ally, they may be located in the

Schenley Quadrangle, but this will
not be next year.

Eleanor Perry, president of
Panhellenic Council, has expressed
the opinion that thepresent pro-

' blem has done nothing to harm
 the sororities and may in the long

run prove‘ beneﬁcial.

Played Rebroadcasts

The history of radio at the
University begins in 1920 when
station _8YI, a student station
working in conjunction with other
stations in the city, broadcasted
baseball scores.

Radio work, on the student
level, at the University was at a
standstill from the twenties un-
til about four years ago.

At this time, a second attempt
at "a. radio station was made.
only to meet dismal failure on
all fronts. The station was not
able to gain recognition.

Work for the present. WPGH
was begun by a group of twelve
studentsmore than two years ago.
From these twelve, the radio sta-
tion drcw its present leadership.

THE GIRL I LEFT. BEHIND ME -

It happens every day. A young man goes off to college leaving
his home-town sweetliefart with -vows of et-ernal love, and then
he ﬁnds that he has outgrown her. “That, in such cases, is the
honorable thing to do?

Well sir, you can do what Rock Sigafoos did.

   

When Rock left Cut and Shoot, Pa., he said tohis sweetheart, I

a simple country lass named Tess d’Urbervilles, “My dear,
though I am far away in college, I will love you always. I will
never look at another girl. If I do, may my eyeballs parch and
wither, may my viscera writhe like adders, may the moths get
my new tweed jacket!”

Then he clutched Tess to his bosom and planted a. ﬁnal kiss
upon her fragrant young skulland went away, meaning with
all his heart to be faitliful. ‘ '

    

 

   
 

Q‘ ,\_I"
I

But on the very ﬁ_1-st day of college he met a coed n.:1.med Futa

Morgana, a girl of such sophistication, such poise, such sarvoir ,

fadre as Rock had never beheld. She spoke knowingly of Franz
Kafka, she hummed l_\'Ioza.rt, ‘she smoked Marlbo1'os, the ciga-
rette with bctter “m.aIcin’s”. Now, Rock didn’t know Franz
Kafka from Pinocchio, or Mozart from James K. Polk, but

' _Marlbo’ros,he knew full well; He knew that anyone who smoked

Marlboros was - modern and advanced and as studded with
brains as a ham with cloves. Good sense tells you that you can’t
beat Marlboro’s‘new improved ﬁlter, and you never could beat
Marlboro’s. ﬁne ﬂavor. This Rock knew. ‘

So all. day he followed Fata around campus and listened to
her talk about Frai1z,‘Kafka, and then in the evening he went
back to the dormitory and found this letter from his hometown
sweetheart Tess:

Dear Rock,’ .

Us kids had a keen time yesterday. We went down to the
pond and caught some frogs. I ca.-ught the most of anybody.
Then we hitched rides on’ 1.‘.-ruclcs and did lots of nutsy st-uﬁ
like that. Well, I must close now because I got to whvltewash
the fe-rice.

I » Your friend," '
I

Tess
P.S. . . .‘I can do my H ula. Hoop 3,000 times.

Well sir, Rock thought about Tess and then he thought about
Fata and then a great sadness fell upon him. Suddenly he knew
he had outgrown young, innocent Tess; his heart now belonged

V to smart, sophisticated Feta.

Rock, being above all things honorable, ‘returned forthwith I
to his home town and walked up to Tess and looked her in the

‘eye and saidmanfully, “I do not love you any more. I love
_ a girl named Fata Morgana. You can hit me in, the stomach with

all your might if you like.’ ? .

,“‘That’s okay, hey,” said Tess amiably. ."I don't love you
neither. ,1 found a new boy.” I

.‘‘What is his name?”. asked Rock.

.“Franz Kafka,” said Tess. ‘

“A splendid fellow,” said Rock and shook Tess's hand and
they have remained good friends to this day. In fact, Rock and
Fata ofteirdouble-date with Franz a.nd‘Tess and have heaps
of fun. Franz can do the Hula’ Hoop 6,000 times.

By LARRY HAGGERTY

Currently in the midst of

a modest ‘one game winning

streak, Bob Timmons’ resurgent Panther hoopsters seek to
win their annual home and home serieswith Carnegie Tech
when they meet their Forbes Avenue rivals at the Skibo Gym

tomorrow evening at 8:30 p.m.

The-Panther andTTartan freshman teams will clash in

the preliminary game. 9

"In last month’s encoutner at
the Field House Tech surprised-
the small crowd present by giving
the Jungle Cats a hard time of it
and lost by only seven points, 82-
75. All-American Don Hennon
saved the Panthers in that tilt by
scoring’ 37‘ points. i

The Tartan’s scoring was
taken care of. largely by Stan

Skalka and Bill Soffa in the ﬁrst

clash between the Oakland ri-

vals. Skalka registered 21 .points

while Soffa hit the nets for, 20.

Sofia, however, is constantly be-

, ing troubled by a bad back and
the Plaid sophomore‘ may not be
in the best physical condition
for the game.

Joining Soﬁfa and Skalka in the
starting lineup are Andy Komer,
Bob» H~a u s e 1' and either Fran-
cis Miller or Tom M u e l l e r.
Komer,". Soﬁa, and Hauser are
each averaging close to 15 points
per game While Komer and ‘Skal-
ka are Tech’s leading rebounders.

'1-‘imrnons will counter Coach
Mel Cratsley’s starting unit-with
Hennon, John Fridley, Dave Saw-
yer, John Mesher and, either John
Mills or Mike Ditka. Mills in-
jured an ankle in practice before
the Holy Cross game and is list-
ed as a doubtful starter.

Hennon had one of_ his best
nights of the season as he tal-
 lied 35 points in leading the Blue
and Gold to their seventh win of
the campaign over Holy Cross
at th Field House last Friday
evening, 83-71. The Panther
captain has scored 518 points in
19 games for an average of 27.3
and is the ﬁfth leading scorer
nationally.

With six victories in as many starts Rex Peery’s matmen
will try for number seven. tonight against the Spartansof
Michigan State. The meet gets underway at 8‘p.m. at the

Field House. - . s

The Spartans will furnish the Panthers withlthe stiffest
competition that Peery~’s men" have faced this season. “Mich-

igan State has one of the ﬁne‘st¢

teams in the country. Their best
men are in the same class as our
best men,” Peery stated.

“In the 130-lb. class they have
an undefeated boy named Norman

L Young, and they have Jim Fer—.

guson, another good boy in the
167-lb. class. These two boys will
face our Larry Lauchle and Tom
Alberts.

”“If either team can win both
these matches, it may determine
the outcome of the meet,” Peery
concluded. Lauchle, a sopho-
more, who will face Young is
also undefeated in his first ﬁve
matches. ~

Saturday night at the Field

House the matmen captured their
sixth win of the season by de-
feating Mankato State, 18-6. The
Panthers again got off to a fast
start’ capturing the ﬁrst
matches and wrapping up the
meet for Peery..

Paul.Powell posted a 15-3 vic-

At this point in the meet Man-

for Art Schaible and the Panthers
were assused of the victory. Al-
