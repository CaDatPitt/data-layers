Locals enroll
in Obamacare

Gideon Bradshaw
News Editor

When Andy Wallace lei’: his job in December of

2011, he could have chosen to pay out of pocket
in order to keep the health insurance his em-
ployer was providing.

But Wallace would have had to pay the full
$600 a month to keep it. Instead, he chose to
go without coverage.

“I didn’twantto pay morethanmy mortgage
for health care,” he said.

About 200 members of the community, vol-
unteers (such as Wallace), elected officials and
health care advocates gathered indoors at Heinz
Field on Thursday to speakwith experts about
enrollinginthe Health Insurance Marketplace.
The Health Insurance Marketplace is awebsite

thatresidentsofPennsy1vaniaandmorethan30 .

other states have been ableto use since Oct. 1to
register for health insurance under the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act

Starting at 4 p.m., 15 certiﬁed application
counselors answered questions about eligibility,
distributed literature and helped individuals
register in the marketplace.

Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald,
who spoke at the event, said that in the Pitts-
burgh region alone, there are 188,000 people
who do not have health insurance. In the state
of Pennsylvania, there are 1.2 million.

“It’s a lot of us,” he said. “It’s people who go
to work every single day and don’t have health
care.”

Alumni Hall with balloons, popcorn and
free clothing.

“We started thinking about the idea in
February, coming up with different plans

The computing lab had been under
construction since late June, and the
grand opening event ran from 11 a.m.

Rhoades said that all labs are evalu-

The latter photograph, Rhoades noted,
was taken at Pitt’s inaugural ACC game

Rhoades said that many students had
voiced comments about the need for fast-

need the entire software package loaded
on existing devices; rather, a basic _of-

preferred. As a result, the “quick-print”

On both of Rolotti’s feet, two of his toes
are webbed together. As a joke, Rolotti had a
small pair of scissors tattooed onthe skin web-

Rolotti said that he would have eventually
gotten a tattoo, anyway, but the convenience
of the shop’s proximity to Pitt caused him to

discontent to the shops’er“np’loyees.

“I get parents coming here, saying, ‘This’

is my daughter’s picture. Do not tattoo her,”’

" Knuxx said. *

Miller said he has also had an experience
where awoman came into the shop‘ with a
picture of her son, a student at Pitt, and told
Miller not to pierce the woman’s son. But
Miller said the situation was more playful

‘ thanserious.

Malone said, legally, parents no longer

have the right to dictate the choices of ‘their ..
children who are 18 and older, but tattoos are

still a topic in discussions between parents
and children. 1
“A lot of people get threatened with, ‘my
parents  stop paying for school if I come
home with a piercing,” Malone said. '
He said, though, that he has never heard
of an instance when this situation occurred

at his shop.

Neither Knuxx nor the employees of Hot
Rod Piercing Company said they have ever
encountered any trouble with an enraged
parent of one of their clients and said they
are not worried.

“[Parents] have to cut the umbilical cord.
Their kid has the right to sign at the dotted
line,” Knuxx said.

Brutsch, who has had her eyebrow and
frenulum — the skin attaching the tongue
to the cavern of the jaw —-— pierced at Hot
Rod, said she has a right to her own opinion
about her body, but still keeps in mind her
mother’s wishes. » _

Brutsch got her eyebrow pierced during

5  the first two months of the 2012-2013 school

year, buttook the piercing out six months later

to appease her mother, who thought a facial

piercing could hurt Brutsch’s future career.
“She didn’t want me to miss a chance

4’ of getting a really good job because I have a

piercing on my face,” Brutsch said. “Though
it is getting more popular and body [modiﬁ-

cations] are somewhat more accepted than
they were a couple decades ago, still people
[assume] things when looking at them.”
_]ester’s Court Tattoo closes at 8 p.m. and
Hot Rod Body Piercing Company closes at 9
p.m., which reduces the odds of students at-
temptingto wander in fromabar ora party to

request to be tattooed or pierced while under ‘

the inﬂuence.

Legally, a person carmot undergo a body
modiﬁcation while intoxicated, but Knuxx
said that the shop has not had any problems
with clients who had been drinking.

While piercings canbe removed and body
jewelry can be replaced with a clear retainer
piece, tattoos are a more permanent decision.
Within limits, Knuxx said he tries to prevent
a student from getting a tattoo that they will
regret later on in life.

, “We tryto keep it moral. Some kid comes
in here" and says, ‘I want this l<id’s name on my
throat,’ we try and talk him out of it,” Knuxx
said. “But if we don’t tattoo it, someone else
will.” I

Fitzgefald said that these people will now
be eligible for coverage under the Affordable
Care Act.

U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Ser-
vices Kathleen Sebelius spoke at the event. Se-
belius said that eventhoughher depamnenthas
received a large number of complaints from
citizens that they were unable to complete reg-
istration on the site, she was optimistic.

“Believe me, we’ve had some early glitches,”
she said. “But it’s getting better every day.”

Mike Murphy, the president of Community
College of Allegheny County, also spoke at the
event and praised the Affordable Care Act for
allowing Americans under the age of 26 to be
eligible for coverage under their parents’ insur-
ance plans.

Dan Rooney, the formerU.S. ambassadorto
Ireland and current chairman of the Steelers,
agreed with Murphy, remarking that he has
nine children.

“I was fortunate,” he said. “But there are
many people in this community who aren’t
as fortunate and who aren’t able to help [their
children] .”

Other politicians and elected officials,
including Pennsylvania representatives Erin
Molchany, D—Mt. Washington, and Dan Frankel,
D-Squirrel Hill, were also present.

Under the Affordable Care Act, those who

do not have health insurance afterjan. 1, 2014,
could be subject to penalties.

Whenwallace, 34, ofDormont, Pa., left the
tech company that heworked foruntil Decem-
ber2011, he had the option of remaining on his
employer’s health plan under the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act.

The act, also known as COBRA, allows em-
ployees who leave companies to stay on their
employers’ plans foralimited amount of time.
The former employee has to cover the whole
cost of the -plan, rather than sharing the costs
with the employer.

Wallace’s girlfriend, 29-year-old Stephany
Conard, was also volunteeringThursday after-
noon and registered on the marketplace when
Wallace did in order to ﬁnd more affordable
coverage.

She has been on COBRA ever since shewas
laid off from her job at a real estate appraisal
company in September.

Although her health insurance only cost her
about $120 a month while she was working,
abouta quarter ofher unemploymentbeneﬁts
go toward paying for health insurance.

“I’m under 30,” said Conard, who gradu-
ated from Pitt in 2007. “I don’t smoke. I have
no pre-existing condition. And still I’m paying
$400 a month for COBRA.”

Wallace, who earns about $70,000 a year
as a self—employed I'I‘ consultant, falls above
the cut-off for government subsidies to help

pay his premium, which is set at 400 percent

of the federal poverty line, or about $45,000.
He said that he still wanted to know the
options for coverage under the new legislation,
since he currently has no health insurance.
Wallace’s and Conard’s applications on the
marketplace are currently pending, and they
are not sure what the plans that are available to
them though the Affordable Care Actwill cost.

’ Theysaidthatacertiﬁedapplicationcounselor

told them it could take about aweekbefore the
site processed their applications.

Wallace said that when he registered on the
marketplace, he occasionally had to refresh
the page to get the site to load correctly so that
he could complete the applicalion. The whole
process took him about 10 to 15 minutes.

joarme Grossi, the regional director of tlie
U.S. Department ofHealth and Human Services
for the area that includes the state of Pennsyl-
vania, said members of the public have com-
plained about difficulties they’ve encountered
in registering, but the department is working
around the clock to ﬁx the glitches.

Grossiwas not sure how many people regis-
tered at the event, but as of Saturday, the web-
site had more than 8 million visitors.

She said that the federal government is
working to increase the number of servers

_ available.

“It was literally ﬁve times as many people
as we thought [we were going to have] who
logged onto the site,” Grossi said. “That was
part of the problem.” I

COLUMN

Journalistic objectivism: Waﬂdng the line
between ignorance and understanding

Natalie Russell
Columnist

Humility is every writer’s antago-
nist. It’s an enemy that hardly lets
you ﬁnish a sentence without re-
minding you of unaddressed com-
plexities and your complete lack
of authority on the subject. A few
weeks ago, I wrote a column on the
conﬂictinsyria, forcingme to tackle
the struggle between self-doubt and
surety head-on. Though I made ev-
ery effort to be as informed as pos-
sible, in the back of my mind there
was always the nagging question:
“But what do I know?”

Intellectual honesty is a difﬁcult
tightrope to walk. It requires balanc-
ing on the thin thread of your under-

standing amid a vast emptiness of
missed details, hidden reports and
lack of experience. The art of the
process of writing authoritatively is
to be aware of your ignorance, while
still maintaining a constructive
voice in the debate. Although this
is the goal, egomaniacal journalists

, are rewarded for generating more

readers, which invites less honest
reporting.

With the debates surrounding
the United States’ involvement in
the Syrian conflict, one particular
case of intellectual dishonesty has
surfaced. I’m talking about Judith
“We-found—WMDs-in—Iraq” ‘Mill-
er. Miller’s reports, printed in the
New York Times between 2002 and
2005, were one important reason

the U.S. government gained sup-
port in going to warwith a country
that had nothingto do with 9/11. On
Sept. 8, 2002, Miller and Michael
Gordon made the front page of the
New York Times with a story about
Saddam Hussein’s quest for alumi-
num tubes “specially designed” to
enrich uranium. The pair’s anony-
mous sources allegedly argued that
“the ﬁrst sign of a ‘smoking gun’ 
may be a mushroom cloud.” It’s also
worth noting that Miller was, and
still is, a pro-war conservative. In
fact, she’s now a regular reporter
for NewsMax, a neoconservative
media outlet.

The stakes in this story were

high, but reports have shown that lenience
toward Miller’s work started early. William
]acksonJr., writer for Editor & Publisher On-
line, said that Miller’s reporting “frequently
[did] not meet published [New York] Times
standards.” Yet these standards didn’t apply
to Miller because, well, she’sJudith Miller.
Part of the reason Miller’s reportingwent
unchecked at the paper was that she con-
sistently delivered front-page stories from
reputable resources. During the newspaper

industry’s decline, generaﬂng solid readership

isn’t always easy.
So what does Miller have to do with intel-
lectual honesty?

Journalistic objectivism is largely consid-
ered a myth, but, in Miller’s case, partisanship
had clearly overstepped its bounds. Her re-
porting, though it might have been an earnest
quest for truth, was clearly skewed by her per-
sonal beliefs. Meanwhile, her power and pres-
tige prevented anyone else at the Times from

fact-checking or requesting more extensive T

reporting. To the credit of the Times, the State
Department even veriﬁed her reports, which

advanced the narrative of Iraqi wrongdoing
that they were trying to establish. Still, you’d
think that having Ahmad Chalabi, a leader
of the Iraqi National Congress leading up to
the 2003 invasidnof Iraq who was working
to overthrow Saddam Hussein’s government,
listed as a primary source would raise at least
a few eyebrows.

The hardest thing for a j oumalist to do is
admit that she doesn’t know or understand

, something. After all, your job as a journalist

is to be well-informed. But_this is precisely
why skepticism and self-doubt are ‘crucial for
journalists — and all writers, for that matter.

Miller is an example of what happens when
you rely too heavily on limited sources and
your editors don’t question your version of
the truth. .

Journalism is a kind of collective quest for
truth: synthesizing sources and collaborating
with editors. Butwhen one person dominates
the conversation, information is polarized to
a version of the truth so subjective it’s often
entirely inaccurate. d

From new information to personal beliefs,
writers should always ask themselves: “What
dolknow?” I " ,

Panthers visitvirginia Tech looking to extend success

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt football hits the road for just the
second time this season, as the Panthers
travel to Blacksburg, Va., for an ACC
Coastal Division. showdown with No.
24 Virginia Tech. Pitt (3-1, 2-1 ACC) will
put its three—game winning streak on
the;line against the ﬁve—game streak
held by Virginia Tech (5-1, 2-0 ACC).

Tight endj.P. Holtz believes that the
Panthers need to keep the same ap-
proach from the team’s three previous
victories in order to extend their win-
ning streak to four.

“We just have to keep doing what
we’re doing,” Holtz said. “I feel like we
can beat anyone if we play together like
we have been.”

Virginia Tech will pose a greater
challenge than New Mexico, Duke or
Virginia did in thelast three games.
Starting on offense, dual-threatquar-
terback Logan Thomas centers the con—

test with 1,212 passing yards and eight

touchdowns over his first six games.

“He’s a guy that can hurt you running
the ball as well as throwing,” Chryst
said. “They’ve got a couple good receiv-

Devin Street leads Pitt with 445 receiving yards. Sheldon Satenstein |-Assistant Visual Editor

ers. Like a lot of teams, they can spread
you out, but they can run‘ power with
him. He’s pretty good.”

 

Those receivers include Willie Byrn
and Demitri Knowles, who accounted
for nearly half of Thomas’ passing yards
this season. Byrn has caught 21 passes
for 303 yards and a touchdown this
season, while Knowles has hauled in 24
balls for 267 yards and a pair of scores.

Pitt has its own pair of Biletnikoff
Award candidates. Devin Street leads
the team with 445 yards on 21 catches
-with three touchdowns, while true
freshman Tyler Boyd has a team-high
23 receptions for 425 yards and a team-
best four touchdowns.

Street and Boyd look forward to
the way Virginia Tech’s secondary will
match up with the Panthers, which
could leave the two receivers with a lot
of room in which to work on the outside.

“It’s going to be a lot of one-on-
one’s, a lot of man-to—man’s,” Street
said. “We’re looking forward to the one-
on—one matchups and we’re going to
have to win one-on—one.”

Men’s and women’s teams face arduous conference foes on road

Andrew Stern
Stayj’ Writer

Pitt men’s and women’s soccer are set for
road bouts this weekend and, although
they’ll each travel to different destina-
tions within the country, both are slated
to face challenging ACC opponents.
Pitt’s men’s team (0-6-3, 0-5-1 ACC)
will head north to face Syracuse (8-4, 2-4
ACC) on Saturday at 7 p.m., beginning the

ACC chapter of a long—standing rivalry. V

Meanwhile, the women’s contingent (4-
8-1, 0-7 ACC) will travel south to face No.
3 Florida State (1o—o-3, 5-0-2 ACC) at 1
p.m. on Sunday.

Though the teams will head inop-
posite directions geographically this

weekend, the Pitt men’s and women’s
teams are each looking to head upward
in the conference ranks.

“Our last match [against Virginia
Tech], we did a good job. But there’s al-
ways a chance to improve as we look to-
ward Syracuse this weekend,” midﬁelder
Nick Wysong said.

For the Pitt men’s team, a major part
of scouting the Orange in preparation for
Saturday’s game will be ﬁguring out how
to defend against Emil Ekblom.

The freshman from Bekkestua, Nor-
way, has been the Orange’s best player
this season. Two matches ago, Ekblom
recorded three goals and an assist in a
5-0 win against North Carolin'a-State.’
This season, Ekblom has scored a con-

ference—leading eight times and, with his
two-goal performance against Boston
College on Tuesday, has taken the lead
for most points in the ACC. :

The Panthers are coming off a suc-
cessful Tuesday outing of their own -
albeit at a different magnitude —— with
a scoreless draw against Virginia Tech
that earned them their first ACC point.
In the match, Pitt had a few opportuni-
ties to score, but the Hokies defense was
stifling. Pitt has struggled offensively
this season, as the team has scored only
four goals through its ﬁrst ninefgames.
Sophomore goalkeeper Dan Lynd, who
currently leads the ACC in saves, has
buoyed the Panthers defensive?" ,

Conversely, Syracuse has fie dédone

of the most potent offenses in college
soccer. The Orange have scored 36 goals
through their first 12 matches. Earlier in
the season, the Orange defeated then—N0.
12 UConn 1-0 and topped North Carolina
State and Duke. The Orange also feature
one of the top goaliesin the ACC in Alex
Bono. This season, Bono has put up a
1.06 goals against average and amassed
38 saves and five shutouts.

“Our goal is to get into the playoffs,”
Wysong said. “Anything can happen once
you get into the postseason. We just need
to continue to work hard and hopefully
get some balls into the back of the net.”

The Pitt women’s side is enduring

Virginia Tech plays a 4-2-5 defensive
scheme, meaning the Hokies utilize four
players on the line, two in the lineback-
ing unit and ﬁve in the secondary. The
secondary is ﬁlled with playmakers who
have combined for 12 interceptions al-
ready this season.

“They’re playing fast in the back end
and aggressive up front,” Chryst said.
“They’re physical when they run the
ball, and they can create havoc, turn-
overs and sacks. I think they’re playing
really conﬁdent, and they should be.”

Pitt’s defense will get a boost this
week because, as Chryst said Thurs-
day, both linebacker Shane Gordon and
defensive end Bryan Murphy will-play
after the two missed Pitt’s 14-3 win over
Virginia due to injuries. '

Pitt will also enter Saturday’s game

with a four-game winning streak against.

similar hardships this season, which are
fueled by a putrid offensive skid that has
resulted in just a single goal in seven ACC
contests. Now the team faces a collection
of the nation’s premier talent.

“Florida State is a very talented team,”
women’s head coach Greg Miller said.
“Again, they’re playing in their home
environment.”

Florida State has defeated in—state
rivals Miami, Florida and Central Florida
while also topping former No. 1 North
Carolina so far this season.

Like the men’s opponent, the Semi-
noles are keyed by a young, foreign star.
Redshirt freshman forward Berglind
Thorvaldsdottir, a native of Iceland, leads
the team with ﬁve goals.

While Florida State has a ton of ﬁre-
power offensively, its defense is equally
dominant. In the net, redshirt senior
Kelsey Wys has been unbelievable. After
racking up Third—Team All—American and
ACC tournament MVP honors last season,
Wys has compiled eight shutouts and a
0.50 goals against average this campaign.

last year in a 35-17 Pitt victory at Heinz
Field. Hokies head coach Frank Beam-
er learned a valuable lesson from that
game.

“We learned that Pittsburgh will
pound you if you don’t play well your-
self,” Bearner said. “They’re always go-
ing to be a team that’s tough for us to
beat. They’ve beaten us the last four
times we’ve played, so we know we’ve
got great respect for Pittsburgh.”

Virginia Tech awaits {the Panthers
at Lane Stadium, which is widely re-
garded as one of the /nation’s most dif-
ﬁcult places to play. While that may have
something to do with the quality teams
Beamer fields every season, Pitt will
get its first true road test in a raucous,
hostile environment.

.“With my past experiences, obvi-
ously when you go on the road and are
on offense, crowd noise is going to be
a factor,” Chryst said. “I’m looking for-
ward to taking these guys down to a
great atmosphere, but we have to be
able to handle it.” 

Now Wys faces the sputtering Pan-
thers, who have lost seven consecutive
ACC games. Sunday against Syracuse, the
Panthers allowed four goals, highlighted
by freshman Stephanie Skilton’s hat trick.

In the last two weeks, the Pitt wom-
en’s team encountered the No. 1, 3 and 9
teams in the country. In the game against
No. 1 Virginia, the Panthers actually en-
joyed a 1-0 lead for a brief period. In the
end, however, Virginia proved to be too
much for the young Panthers, winning
3-1.

Pitt is paced offensively by sophomore
midﬁelder Roosa Arvas, who has two
goals and three assists, and defensively
by goalie Nicole D’Agostino. This sea-
son D7-Xgostino, a redshirt junior, ranks
ﬁfth in save percentage and ﬁrst in saves
with 77, which is 27 more than the No.
2 keeper.

D’Agostino and the Panthers will be
tested this weekend, but they’re not alone
in that regard. \

“We haven’t been great on the road
this year, so we’ve got to ﬁgure out some-
thing different to try and put out a good
product and get a result,” Miller said of
the women’s team, though both Panthers
soccer teams will share that goal this
weekend. I

BARNES BURNER

Pirates’ revitalizing season commences promising future

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

A World Series title is obviously, and jus-
tiﬁably, the desired end-result for every
Major League Baseball team when spring
training rolls around each February.
The Pittsburgh Pirates won’t hoist the
Commissioner’s Trophy in these 2013
playoffs, thanks to their 3-2 series loss
to St. Louis in the National League Divi-
sion Series.

But the Pirates’ 2013 season was an
absolute success.

The Pirates won 97 total games, took
the ﬁrst wild card spot, played a play-
off series and posted a winning regular
season for the ﬁrst time since 1992. Ad-
ditionally, they led the Cardinals —— who
have now been to three straight National

League Championship Series — 2-1 in

the NLDS.
Most importantly, the 2013 Pirates
completed the process that Clint Hurdle

envisioned when he was hired as the fran-
chise’s 39th manager on Nov. 14, 2010.
The city of Pittsburgh has officially recon-
nected with its baseball team.

This connection was on full display
throughout the three playoff games
played at PNC Park (the ﬁrst three ever
played at PNC Park) when more than
120,000 fans turned the stiles clad all in
black for the PNC Park blackout spurred
on by Michael McKenry and other players
via social media.

Remember those 40,000-plus chant-
ing, “Cue—to, Cue-to,” in the Wild Card
Game against Cincinnati, right before

‘ Russell Martin hit the ﬁrst of his two

home runs in that game? And remember
how the building shook when the crowd
erupted following Martin’s bomb?

Baseball is back in Pittsburgh. The
best part? It’s here to stay.

Think back to 1992, following the Pi-
rates’ loss to Atlanta in the N LCS. Those
Pirates were struggling to stay together,

based largely on the fact that the team did
not have the resources to keep players
like Barry Bonds and Bobby Bonilla in a
Pirates uniform.

This 2013 team?]ust about all of it will
return not only for next year, but for the
foreseeable future.

Gerrit Cole, who developed into an
ace before the city’s very eyes fromjune
1, is under team control through 2019.

Andrew McCutchen’s contract exten-
sion will keep him in a Pirates uniform
through 2018, when the franchise will
likely pick up the option it has on the
ﬁnal year of his six—year deal.

His outfield-mate Starling Marte
posted a 4.6 wins above replacement in
his ﬁrst full season as a major—leaguer,
compared to McCutchen’s 3.5 WAR in
the MVP candidate’s ﬁrst year. Marte is
under franchise control through 2018.

In order to keep that core together,
the front oﬁice must make a push to re-
sign Pedro Alvarez this season. His aver-

age is poor and is a non-factor against
left-handed pitchers, but the inﬁelder
led the National League with 36 home
runs and hit another two in the playoffs
while driving in a run in each game -
he’s worth it.

The team’s current talent reaches even
outside this solid core.

2014 may see the debuts of Gregory
Polanco andjameson Taillon, who made
their way to Triple-A Indianapolis this
season. At the end of the season, MLB.
com’s Prospect Watch lists Taillon as the
No. 10 prospect in baseball, with Polanco
at No. 13.

Polanco slots into right ﬁeld auto-
matically when he arrives, likely in the
summer of 2014, and is a permanent
solution to the issues that plagued the
Pirates enough in 2013 to make a move
for Marlon Byrd. For a reference point on
Polanco, think Starling Marte but with

more power and less strikeouts. He’s go-
ing to be good.

The same goes for Taillon, the No. 2
overall draft pick from 2010. With his
arrival, and development hopefully along
the same lines as Cole’s, the Pirates own a
pair of aces that should negate any time
the team needs to face a tandem of Mi-
chael Wacha and Adam Wainwright or
Johnny Cueto and Mat Latos. 5

Additionally, Pittsburghiwill have Clin
Hurdle on the bench and Neal Huntington
in the executive’s suite once again. These
men deserve as much credit for this suc-
cess as any player who took the ﬁeld.

fans, except to just know it’s going to
get better. ’ ‘  1

Remember it by the introductions
prior to the Wild Card, when Clint Hurdle
saluted the fans in the stands and An-
drew Mccutchen held his hand over his
heart and next to the “P” on the Pirates’
alternate black jersey as he spun slowly
for all to see.

Remember it byjason Grilli’s save cel-
ebration, double ﬁst—pumps and punch-
ing Russell Martin three times in the

g chest pad.

Remember it by Alvarez’s towering
home runs.

Remember it by the Pirate Parrot,
standing alone on the mound after each
win, raising the Jolly Roger with gusto.

Remember it for those who didn’t get
a chance to see the worst losing streak in
sports end, and for those who got their
ﬁrst chance to see what it’s like for Pitts-
burgh to love its baseball team again.
