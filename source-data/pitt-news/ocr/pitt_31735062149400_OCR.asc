Party Judges
On Merit Basis

(Results on Page Four)

Forming the first nominating
convention in the history of the
University, the Independent Party
met “Wednesday, selected nomi-
nees for SFA and College Associa-
tion, and adopted a platform on-

dorsing merit as the basis for the se— _

lection of student ofﬁcers

Six men and three women were

chosen as candidates for senior seats
in SFA and an equal number named
for junior seats in next year’s assem-
bly. The convention also selected
alternates for SFA and appointed
candidates for president, vice presi-
dent, secretary, and treasurer of the
College Association.
FILE PETITIONS

The candidates and alternates
named at Wednesday’s convention
will now ﬁle petitions for candidacy
in the general student elections with
the executive board of SFA, which
makes the official nominations. Can-
didates for College Association will
ﬁle petitions in the’ College office.

J. Karl Stark, C40, opened the con-
vention and conducted the election of
the chairman. Jack Hoeveler, C40,
was elected chairman by acclamation.

In his keynote address, Hoeveler
announced that the organization had
no quarrel with fraternities as such,
that the convention was no attempt to
discredit them or “run them off the
campus.”

OBJECT TO METHODS

- “We object only to their methods
of picking candidates for political of-
ﬁces and membership to honoraries
on the basis of the fraternity affilia-
tion rather than on individual mer-
its,” he stated.

“This Independent Party organiza-
tion is not just our attempt to grab up
some of the political gravy, but a si.n-
cere effort to improve the personnel
of our student governing bodies by
eliminating the opportunity for every
Tom, Dick, and Harry, who feels like
snorting around in the spring to be
elected.” he added.

“It is an attempt to say to the er-
ecutive committee of SFA, ‘Here you
are. We’ve looked over the ﬁeld of

,and “Diamond Jim Brady.”

independent candidates and these;
people are the ones we consider the}
best available material.’ ”

Pi Kappa Alpha, Lambda Chi Al-
pha, Sigma Alpha Mu, and Sigma}

second Interfraternity progressive
dance of the year on Friday evening,
according to Albert J. Eger, BA40,
chairman of the affair.

An invitation has been extended to
all fraternity men at the University
to attend this affair, and support the
efforts of the council to promote
unity among the fraternities.

Lambda Chi Alpha, capitalizing on
its unique position in respect to di-
rection from the Cathedral, will dec-
orate as the “last outpost in tre des-
ert,’ while other houses have prom-

Dr. Jordan works odd hours, some-
times getting up at 2 a. m. to make
observations, and at other times la-
boring late at night. His chief hob-
by is photography, which works in
well with his astronimical work.

ber 24, 1965, Dr. Jordan was edu-
cated at Marietta college. where he
received the Ph. D. degree in 1889
and M. A. degree in 1892; and at the
University of Chicago, where he re-
ceived the Ph. D. degree in 1914.
Marietta college honored him with
the Sc. D. degree in 1929.

Dr. Jordan taught mathematics at
Marietta college, 1889 to 1900; taught
science and mathematics in the Port-

land, Oregon high school, 1890 to

-~.;4-. gitsarisisasassg‘

 

1892; and taught science at the Colo-
rado Springs high school, 1902 to
190g. He attended the University of
Chicago on a fellowship from 1905
to 1908, and has been at the Univer-
sity since then as professor of astron-
omy and director of the observatory.
Dr. Jordan is a member of Phi
Beta Kappa and of Sigma Xi, of the

American Association for the Ad- , Jalnjson, director
vaneement of Science, the American heajth Service, is serving as health

national Astronomical union, and the
Societe Astronomique de France.

He has written fiction based on
astronomy and has contributed scien-
tiﬁc articles to the Natural History
Magazine. the American Museum of
Natural History, and other publica-
tions.

Concerning the younger genera-
tion. Dr. Jordan says:

“People have been saying that
young people have been going to the
bow-wows for 100 years, but they are
no different from what they were
when I was a boy.”

coach to succeed Dr. John Bain

forthcoming in the early part.‘ of
next week.

Twice postponed, the board meet--

At that time consideration and ap-

director.

Administrative officials gave the
desire for as full an attendance as
possible as the reason for the post-
ponement of meetings previously
slated for Tuesday and Thursday of
this week.

Athletic director Hagan had no
comment upon his considerations for
the post made vacant by the Suther-
land resignation. He would not even
conﬁrm the report that he has pre-
pared a recommendation to be pre-
sented to the University trustees.

Reports current the past few days
have Charles W. Bowser as the lead-
ing candidate. These reports have
even made public the belief that
Bowser is the only candidate.

Neither Bowser nor administrative
sources have given any conﬁrmation
to these reports. Nevertheless, they
have been accepted by the public as

reliable conclusions.

Wolovitz Gives
Labor Cregrarri

Employees or unions should have
the right to sue employers in Com-
mon Pleas courts in case of discrim-
ination against them, according to
Abe Wolovitz, C39, delivering the re-
port of the labor committee of the
University delegation to the Inter-
collegiate Conference on Govern-
ment.

This is one of the deﬁnite changes
in state government suggested by the
labor committee.

Reforms to be suggested by the la-
bor committee at the April conclave
follow:

“We favor requiring industries in
the state of Pennsylvania to insure
for workn1en’s compensation with
the state insurance funds.

“We favor a state minimum wage
and niaximum hour law to conform
with the federal law.

“We favor state regulation of the
wages, hours and conditions of labor
of domestic help.

“The right of injunction in labor
disputes should be limited.

“The labor department should be
empowered to collect unpaid wage
claims of workers.”

The average cost for each student
to attend the conference in Harris-
burg in April was set at a minimum
of $10.50. This includes transporta-

tion, housing, meals and incidental
expenditures.

Br. liar;-ahaeli to Draw lip Plane 1

lfor County” s Hostel Urganiaation

By Alice Benovitz

For years, thousands of young peo-
ple in England, Germany, and other
continental countries have spent their
summers hiking or bicycling from
hostel to hostel. Rapidly spreading
to America, the Youth Hostel move-
ment was enthusiastically pushed all
over the country, becoming especial-
ly popular in the New England
states.

With the appointment of Dr. John
Dambach, head of the athletic de-
partment in the University, as chair-
man of the Youth Hostel committee
in Allegheny county, hostels for
hikers will be established around
Pittsburgh. South Park authorities

9 have already made a “gift” of the old

golf clubhouse to the association. Ac-
cording to Dr. Dambach, by this sum-
mer his committee plans to have a
chain of hostels in a loop south and
east of the city about 10 or 12 miles
apart.

Anyone belonging to the American
Hostel Association (one dollar for
‘those under 21, two dollars for those
over 21) can stay at a hostel for 25
cents a night. The House parents
may provide breakfast; the hikers
cook their other meals or buy food
along their walks.

A

Dr. Dambach was selected as
chairman of the local organization
because of his investigation of the
hostel system in Germany four years
ago. “The standards in American
hostels are much higher than in Eu-
rope,” said Dr. Dambach. “Ameri-
cans demand more comforts.”

In Europe, the hostels are subsi-
dized by the government and every-
thing from abandoned factories to
army barracks are utilized. “One of
the most unusual hostels I visited
 an old castle. In another part
of Germany a canal boat anchored
in the river had been taken over by
the hostel association,” said Dr. Dam-
bach.

One development that has not yet

a

hit America is the establishment of,

inexpensive hostels in the cities as-
conveniences for the people coming
in from the country.

Although the committee, which:
consists of prominent persons in the
YWCA, Girl Scouts, Allegheny Bu-
reau of Parks, and the NYA have just.
begun their work, they are very en-
thusiastic and hope to make hosteling
in this country as big a project as it
is in New England.

On Nominations

For Nomination

WITII all the flourishes of a big-time political

convention, the new Independent party has
iioniiiiatetl for nomination for the spring elections
a full slate of candidates.

'i‘went,v-two nominations have been made for

‘SFA and College Association posts. That 22 will
a/-‘.'.nall_v have their names on borrowed voting ma-
chines in Memorial Hall. however, is a matter of
(lo-nht. For it :-e»_»n1s that. according to the rules
an-.1 regulations for student elections, all candidates
tor SFA must stand for nomination before that
g':‘:mp’s executive coinniittcc.
, ilnt there is no l<;n1;,'e1' 21113’ doubt that the In-
cl ]}'.’!l';lClli'S will ii,o;‘.1‘;'e more proininently in this
 ar's (:‘rllll1)£!l_‘_’.‘ll. In view of this fact, the part)"s
air.-.5 take on g:'reate1‘ signiﬁcance.

"l‘lie:e are really only two hroatl objectives,
whicll such a group can seek:

(l) A more equitable redist1'il)ution of seats,
.'t'!‘:-’ii :1 ctm.~-:eq11<-nt redirection of political plums.

(2) An at-titre and iiitclligeiit prograni to re-
vitalize student {.:‘.“n'e1-nnient, to face s§.p_1arel_v and
vqithotit the tisiial “weaseling',” student prolilenis
_-at the Uiiivcrsity.

A more equitable representation will be a fine
‘thing. But if the main end is to he a mere shift in
pov-mi‘, a chan;_.re in the (listri‘oution of political
-psil'2'<>i1zi,{;‘e. it will he hardly worth the trouble to
the student. body at large.

If, however. the Independents are reall_v sincere
'-——end we trust. the)‘ arc—thc_v will direct their
;_-gmnp in an honest effort to raise student govern-
n:«-nt from its current “la11g'l1ing—stocl{ level,” and
will not liesitate to declare themselves on vital stu-
dent issues.

The Independent group avers that theirs is not
‘a. battle of independents vs. fraternities. '\-Ve agree;
:~.~uc.l1 an issue would be petty indeed.

The issue must he one of an honest, undozninated,
active student government vs. the custoniarily
lethargic group that meets once a month. distrilnites
dance cliairmanships and listens to committee re-
ports. ‘he student body, we are convinced, will
support any group which gives evidence of a de-

, .-'.il’(’ to meet this issue squarely.

A “Tell Known

NO'l‘I-IER act in the legitimate version of “Mein

now showing on the European stage.

It is a tense monient, as dramatic instances go.
The players have reached the part in the script,
where?‘ the hero, amid the wild acclaim of the per-
secuted multitudes, rushes to the rescue, with the
aid. of his valiant soldie1‘s.

.’»ut wait. Soinething must. be wrong‘. The
crowds are booing and hissing; they are crying, and
sing-ing the n1ournt'ul strains of their national
ant.hein. Didn't the lines call for shouts and cheers
and wild scenes of rejoicing; weren’t the women
to strew violets in the path of the victors, the men
to respond with upraised arms and loud “Heils.”

The hero is furious. These ungrateful wretches.
he in tters, have spoiled my act. But never mind.
'l‘he3' will soon learn. And the newspapers back
_home will still give me fine “rave” notices.

THE PITT N EWS

Pittponrri

By Marsh Nesbitt

Pittites Rate Girls Bids

Letting down the frat brothers and taking in
PCW’s notorious Junior Prom were Phi Gams Bob
Forsythe and Ray Dimit . . . The former was squired
by red-headed Mary Babs formerly of the Johnson
league. Dimit rated his bid from Pat Brennan .
one of the loveliest gals ever to hit the Woodland
Road School. Also there was hockey player Dick
Friday who is making Oliver shots count these days,
and Bill Allen of Freshman Dance fame.

Dropping in on last Wednesday’s fashion show and
dance we saw Patsy Griiﬁth keeping check on Jane who
was Picarding with Rex Williams. We liked the way
Mary Mills dragged Harry (Little Abner) Holt around
the stage. Apparently the crowd was too much for
Holt who is not so ill at ease in the Delt house. We
think Jean Hahn had a date after the show . she
seemed in such a hurry to get off the stage . . ’tis ru-
mored the prancing manikins had a high old time at
Billy Blair’s apartment after the show. Downstairs we
saw Timmy Raker with his collection of drivers licenses
displayed on the table . . six plus sixteen is twenty-
two, we might add the story didn’t go over . . Braun
has now tapped Fortledge!

What, No Horse ?

One of the finest faux pas yet to reach our ears con-
cerns two Theta lovelys, Margy Gibson and Betty Coul-
son. It seems that Margy was clothed in jodphurs
(riding breeches to antiequestri-ans) and wanted to
make a quick purchase at a downtown department store.
While Margy was making her purchase a cop ordered
Betty to move the car . . Margy trotted up and down
Fifth Ave. ten minutes looking for her car . . we are
also informed that Joe Roberts is a very accomplished
Fiorseman.

Ruth Hawker and Jack Lawlor are deﬁnitely
t-t-t-t-t for the third time. Jack does the collegiate
hockey commentating at the Craig St. arena. In this
line m:.=._v we say that Soupy Campbell, Clint Sipe,
Chick ﬁlasscl, Bill Hoeveler. Larry Orr, Bill Smale,
Paul Kehberger, Ray Gripp, Fritz Bentzel and others
are regular puck followers at the local rink. Evan
Sage will have his Ann from near Ft. Monroe, in town
for the Military Ball.

Al. Abronavich plays as sweet a harmonica as We
have ever heard, and we understand he is being written
into the current C and G show, “At Your Service.” On
ti:-i.s subject may we mention that on last Week’s pro-
gram Paul Whiteman played, “Diary of Dreams,” one of
the shows songs composed by Ade Robson.

Queeries

Around the city we have seen some oddities worthy
of mention. This week’s number one . . the cop on
Seventh and Smithﬁeld who drops his whistle from
mouth to hand; never watching it, yet always catch-
ing it. In second place . . the large Sign of a. Penn
Ave. ﬁlling station advertising, “Diesel Fuel for sale.”

Students Disapprove
Return of Colonies

By Student Opinion Surveys of America

AUSTIN, Texas, March 16.-American sentiment
against Hitler is pointed out in another way, this time
among college students of the nation. The latest poll
of the Student Opinion Surveys of America reveals an
overwhelming majority of students opposing the return
to Germany of the colonies taken from her after the
World War.

the background while 1‘./Iussolini’s Tunisian aspirations
occupy the center of the European stage, Hitler has
many times made it known that he will accept no rub-
stitutes for territory. Some observers believe Der
Fuehrer desires the African colonies not so much for
their resources as for new military bases.

Whatever Hitler’s motives are, American college stu-
dents, members of the group that supplied many ﬁght-
ers for the last war, oppose the idea as shown by their
answers to the question, “Should the colonies taken from
Germany after the World War be returned to her?”
Survey staﬂ members for The- News and’ the other
eighty-four member publications found students con-
sistent in their opinions everywhere. The national to-

tals:
Return the colonies, said . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..28.1%
Keep them, said . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .71.9%

Percentages of student opinion tally closely with
those found by polls of all voters in the United States
and England some time ago. In both countries 76 per
cent were against return of the possessions.

Local Results

Local opinion in favor of returning Germcmy"s lost:
colonies to her is slightly above the national student
average as reported by the Student Opinion Surveys
of America.

While 30 per cent of those questioned on the campus-
?.UGT"e tLn‘E.I.i'ng that Hitler should receive his African
calm;-icsy, only 65 per cent opposed. The opposition is
about 7 per cent lower than national student opinion.

About five per cent of those questioned had no
c-piirion on the subject.

You Said it .. .. .
Wa11ted—‘Social Responsibility’

Dr. Charles Seymour, president, Yale University:
“The student should acquire and graft into his very
being the social and mental habits that underlie citi-
zenship in a democracy. The country needs citizens
with a sense of social responsibility and mental capac-
ity for understanding public issues far more than it
needs technical experts.

The Trend Reverses
Dr. Rufus D. Smith, New York University:

“The educational program for colleges and universi-
ties in the future will call for much greater selectivity
in the admission of students and a consequently greatly
intensified program of study. Colleges and universi-
ties will have to divert their-attention gradually from
giving less time to more students to giving more time
to fewer students, a distinct reversal of the trend that
‘.215 characterized the past two decades.

Although German colonial demands have ‘faded into

SFA Menihers Charge
Spring Election Frauds

By Irving Kaufman

\Vith student elections approach-
ing rapidly upon the wings of pre-
dictions and counter predictions it is
time to look at the dirty side of last
year’s election.

That last year’s

Council, and College Association
posts, the question is bound to arise
whether these posts, and their attend-
ent elections are beneﬁcial. If these
elections are so dirty, they do not
serve any desirable educational pur-
pose and do not “make for good cit-
izenship,” to use an oldtimer.

Perhaps SFA should abolish these
elections and instead sponsor some
worthwhile project, for instance, a
course in the ﬁner points of cheating
on exams.

I am sure immediate results of the
latter project would be much more
valuable.

election was plen-
ty dirty was the opinion expressed
by many present SFA members at
their recent meeting on Tuesday eve-
ning.

UNFAIR BALLOT

As the one loneiy spectator at this
meeting, I heard comments during
the course of the discussion that led
me, an outsider, to believe that last
year’s “plebiscite” was as clean as
some of the more recent plebiscites
of the present day.

As a student who voted only once
last year, I was interested to hear
that some of the aides serving in the
last polling were a little partial to
repeaters of their chosen party. Now

groups which are supposedly impar-
tial, the reports of these “irregulari-
ties” are startling. However, it turned
out that disclosure of these facts sur-
prised only Dr. Lanfear, and me.

Last year’s cheating, alleged by
the members, is not the point of
greatest importance, evidently, for,
according to some SFA members,
that _vear’s dirty work is just around 1
the Commons Room pillars, unlessl
some remedy is found and applied.
SEVERAL REMEDIES

Several remedies were found and
oﬁered to the Assembly. These sug-
gestions ranged from having about
100 aides and changing the “guard”

From the
Shoulder

By Leonard Levison
Sports Editor

 

More signiﬁcance than the reports have yet indicated may be at-
tached to the most recent disruption in the town gridiron mentor-
ships. By certain deductions, Clipper Sn1ith’s walking the Bluff
plank augurs a profound change in Duquesne’s athletic policy.

\Vithout making too evident the effects of a well-grounded bias,
we may say that Duquesne  one of the Pittsburgh schools that was
lifted up into the national sports picture by the pioneering Panthers.
If it hadn’t been for the country-wide prominence that was Pitt’s,
Dhdiiesne probably wouldn't have gone as far as it did in a national
way, itself.

Now, it seems that the Dukes are going in for a “retrenchment”
policy, themselves. Vfith the absence of Notre-Damed Smith from the
campus, and his replacement by a local boy, it might. appear that the

Dukes feel they have had enough of the national picture. Perhaps
they intend now to proceed 011 a less grandiloquent. plane. Then
again, this may be nothing but ill-founded presumption.

Strangely coincidental, however, with this Blnﬁ shuffle was the
statement handed out by Duquesne’s alumni head, who went on rec-
-ord as in favor of an athletic program of greater “breadth.” This
may be the key.

There is nothing but a low moan coming out of the Tartan bowl.
If you can be influenced by those close to the Tech scene, you will
come away convinced that football has no future on the Kiltie cam-
pus. As one prominent Tech man has been heard to say, “It must
be a plot. Some industrialists must be paying the college presidents
to eliminate football from the college curriculum.”

Among the things that we can have less of, are the involved play-
offs that feature the hockey leagues. After going through an extensive
season of play to determine the league standings, the ice moguls sys-
tematically disregard everything that has been done before and go
into the play-offs. About the only thing that disqualiﬁes a team from
participating in these championship play-offs is its last place stand-
ing. This selective method is then used to find out the champions.

\Vl1at is the purpose of having a league race if it isn’t going to
mean anytliing‘! Or, better yet, why have the play-offs, in which :1
team that liasbarely made the upper four-ﬁfths of the league stand-
ing has about an equal chance of winning? Can ’t a champion be bet‘-
ter determined over a long period of time rather than a few hectic,
anything-can-happen, days? It all gets down to a matter of nasty,
sordid commercialisni. Let’s not argue.
=93 

S5-

>K<

One factor that will lessen the burden of Pitt ’s next football coach

is that everyone thinks of the position in terms of d1ft".eult1es. Every-

. . . W T .

one has been reniarklng as to the unenviablity of the post. Which

means that no one expects too much, or even much at_all from future

Pitt teams. Wliieh further means that when something unexpected,

such as the winning of a game occurs, everyone will think of it in

nothing but commendatory terms. A job is really hardest when big
accomplishments are taken for granted.

As Season’ s Outstanding Player

All ready selected for a position on1>
practically every all-city and all-
district college basketball teams that
ﬁnds its way into print, Panther for-
ward Eddie Straloski, sophomore, has
been singled out as the outstanding

player of the season by the coaches
of the Eastern Intercollegiate Basket-
ball Conference.

In balloting for the annual Asso-
ciated Press All-Conference team,
Straloski polled 10 out of a possible
12 points. Straloski combined" high
scoring-116 points—with strong de-
fensive play. He compiled this'point-
age despite his absence from a half
-dozen games because of injury.

A ﬁrst year man on Pitt’s varsity,
Straloski early cinched a position on
the team. During Pitt’s annual mid-
west jaunt, early in the season, Stra1-
oski injured his ankle in the ﬁrst
game, and was out for the remainder
of the four game trip. A recurrence
of the injury put him on the injured
list later in the season. but he ﬁnish-
ed the schedule sparking the team.

Straloski is a product of Connelly
High where he was a member of the
city championship team. Making all-
star teams is not unusual with Stral-
oski, he started the habit at Connel-
ly when he made the all-city team.

Pitt men George Kocheran, guard,
and Larry Paffrath, forward, re-
ceived honorable mention in the bal-
loting. The ﬁrst team included be-
sides Straloski, Joe Murphy. George-
town, at forward; Bob Stark. Carne-
gie, center; and Ed Boyle, Temple,
and Harry Lothes, West Virginia,
guards.

Panthers Face Tech

In Curtain

Dropper

Comes tomorrow night the end oft?

the regular season for the Panther
hockeyites with Carnegie Tech, east-

ern division tail enders, as the oppo- '

sition.
There was a time, earlier in the

season, when that word “opposition” ’
would have been used as a form of’

sarcasm, but with the memory of the
Pitt-Fenn game last Tuesday still
fresh in their minds, Pitt fans will
be inclined to see more omnious
connotations in the word.

All of which means that, although
the Terrible Tartans are something
less than awe-inspiring, the Panthers
were bad enough against Fenn to
give almost anybody a reasonable
chance to beat them.

Add to that the fact that Duquesne
only beat the Skibos 2-0 on Tues-
day, and there begins to be reasona-
ble doubts of a Pitt victory.

The McSorley outﬁt must win im-
pressively tomorrow in order to
bolster their followers’ spirit and
make the odds closer for the playoffs
against Duquesne which are slated
for next week.

Bob Schooley, out of the Fenn
game with a charleyhorse, may not
be in uinform against Tech since
his leg has not responded so well to
medical treatment. If there is any
question at all, about the extent of
the injury, Mcsorley will probably
keep Bob on the bench, desiring to
save him intact for the playoffs.

Should Pitt win, the season’s league
record will stand at 13 wins, four de-
feats, and a tie for 72 points, as com-
pared to the Dukes’ 17 triumphs -and
one loss for 34 points.

Against Fenn, Pitt was a sorry
team. The passing was sloppy, the
checking was ineﬁicient, the stick-
work vi‘ as mediocre, and the shooting
was way below par. In fact, the low-
ly Clevelanders scored the ﬁrst goal
at 6:04 of the ﬁrst period when Hin-
kel broke away from a ﬁve-man
power drive.

The Panthers ﬁnally tied it up at
4:52 of the second session when Broi-
do scored from Pat Cusick. The win-
ning tally slid past Goalie Taylor at
11:01 when Artz laid a perfect pass
in front of Dick Friday who did the
rest.

iﬂonorary Club

“Organized oﬁiciating is the key-
;note of a successful intramural pro-
‘ gram” stated Director James H. Potts
Wednesday as he addressed the of-
ﬁcials for the coming mushball sea-
son.

Frank Ohl. Panther track star, who
has been handling the assignments
for referees, San Milanovich, Buck
Wetzel, Andy Johnson, Larry Tre-
gonning, and Bert Jaﬁe comprised
Mr. Potts’ audience. It will be these
six students plus Babe Egan and pos-
sibly one or two more students who
will be the charter members of the
Oﬁicials Club which Potts is organ-
izing.

It is Potts’ belief that such a club
would make for uniform decisions in
case of protests. This group will al-
so be in line to handle football, vol-
leyball, and basketball in next year’s
program as none are in the senior
class and will be back next year.

Admittance to the club will be by
petition and the passing of a com-
petitive examination. No one not fa-
miliar with all types of sports will be
eligible to gain entrance to this new-
17 organized group.

Among the other duties of the Of-
"zcial Club Will be to work in con-
junction with track coach Carl Ol-
son at the Pitt home meets and to be
the judges in the coming intramural
swimming tournament.

will be used.

According to Bernard Mayer, C39,
chairman of the election committee,
about 100 aides will be used during
the election to enforce voting rules
and to see that “no electioneering is
carried on inside Memorial Hall.”

VOTING IVIACHINES

Prior to this discussion it was an-
nounced that Memorial Hall has al-
ready been obtained, and 14 voting
machines will be lent by city officials.

The Narick proposal to dedicate a
plaque in honor of Dr. John B. Suth-
erland, former head football coach
was unanimously accepted by the
body. Committees have been ap-
pointed to decide what form the tes-
timony will take, how the necessary
funds will be raised, and when and
where the plaque should be placed.

According to Emil Narick, BA40,
originator of the plan, the adminis-
tration approves of this method of
expressing student, faculty, and
alumni appreciation of the former
coach’s services to the University.

SIPES SUGGESTS PAA

Suggesting that the Pittsburgh
Athletic association might be an ap-
propriate place for the memorial,
Brooks Sipes, C39, said, during dis-
cussion on the project, that either a
gift should be given Dr. Sutherland
or that the remembrance should be
put “some place where the hypocrisy

will not be so apparent.

Narick said, “If we get a lot of
money, we’ll probably make a bust.”

Mary Gregg, C40, reminded mem-
bers that few meetings remain in the
present year. She suggested that
SFA should “evaluate our year’s
work to see . . . if we have carried
on a worthwhile policy.”

John Downie, C39, president, ans-
wered Miss Gregg by saying that he
would submit his report of the year’s
work to The News for publication
“in a few days.” He was authorized
to make such a report at last month’s
meeting.

Library Registers One-third of Student

Body for Present Academic Semester

Of all the students enrolled
courses at the University this semes-
ter, 37 per cent are registered in the
library. College, evening, and un-
classiﬁed students as a group had the
highest registration ﬁgures, 63 per
cent.

The Graduate School ranks sec-
ond with the School of Education,
Business Administration, Engineer-
ing, Mines, Law, and Dentistry fol-
lowing in that order.

Main reason why registration ﬁg-
ures for technical and graduate stu-
dents are lower is because their
schools maintain separate libraries
with books relating closely to sub-
jects in their curricula. It has also
been pointed out that many students
from all schools (make frequent use
of Carnegie library.

, A
111'

Registration procedure in the li-
brary is simple. The student has only
to show his registration card and ﬁll
out one form. Then he may make
use of all departments in the library
by showing his stamped registration
card.

A proposal is being considered to
make library registration compul-
sory when students register for their
course at the ﬁrst of each semester.

In the School of Education, 33 per
cent of the students are registered
in the library; in the School of Busi-
ness Administration, 28 per cent; in
the Engineering School, 19 per cent;
in Mines, 16 per cent; in Law, 6 per
cent; and in the Dental School .6 per
cent. In the evening school, 38 per
cent of the students are registered in
the library.

'- "With one foot on the land,
and one in industry,

America is safe.”
—HENRY FORD

FEGEOIEY

A DOZEN small Ford plants dot the
fields and meadows within fifty
miles of Dearborn. We call them the
“village industries.” Their windows
are bright in the sun, and their
wheels turn to the harnessed energy
of once lazy streams.

Many of their workers are farm-
ers who love ﬁne machinery. After
harvest and before green-up, these
farmer-workmen park their cars in

in a Meadow

neat rows beside the plants. Inside,
with the newest, most modern ma-
chines, they build Ford parts.

With the money earned, they buy
that fertile forty just east of the pas-'
ture lot—-—families go to school—
houses grow wings —-barns are ﬁlled
with provender and sheds with back-
saving machinery.

These Ford families have one
foot on the land and one in industry.

ronn MOTOR company

They raise food for themselves and
feel secure. They know that if slack
times come, farm and garden will
still provide employment.

Life is pleasant in the villages.
Working conditions are almost ideal.
Men do better work and are BEE
of their contribution to Ford quality.
It shows up in the ﬁne performance
and all-around dependability of the
1939 Ford cars.
