Alumni Welcome HGMIHOII

At Building Fund Luncheon
. By DONALD GIFFIN ‘
Sports Editor ‘ - - A. \

After an earlier unsuccessful try, Mayor David  Lawrence
finished a job he was supposed to do in December. He welcomed
Tom Hamilton, Pitt’s new athletic director, to Pittsburgh at the

Alumni Association luncheon Saturday afternoon.
The former Annapolis athletic director was grounded last month
' i

when he attempted to fly here fore

the Pittsburgh ‘Quarterback’s ban-
quet. '

Hamilton shared the Saturday
program with Chancellor Rufus
H. Fitzgerald’s review of the
building program and announce-
ment of chairmen of the alumni’s
fund-raising drive for that pro-
gram.

Four overall chairmen, with
Attorney G. Dixon Shrum in
charge, will head the campaign.
Ten other chairmen, one for alum-
ni of each school of the University
in Allegheny County, will oper-

ate under C. Santon Belfour, sec-
retary of Pittsburgh Foundation.
J. Clyde Barton, secretary of
the Alumni Association, told the
gathering they were carefully
chosen for “the big- job” of con-
tacting the 30,000 alumni of Pitt.
“We hope to know by April 15
what the alumni has accomplish-
ed in the drive,” he said.

ﬁed on progress made in build-

Student Christian Federation Formed
BySeven Campus Religious Units

Approval of the charter at a

.meeting Friday evening, in Grace

Reformed Church, brought into

reality the Student Christian Fed-
eration, and organized the first re-
ligious organization of its kind in
the history of the University. The
Student Chrstian Federation has
been formed to further under-
standing and cooperation and pro-
vide meditation for evangelical
students.

S e v e n outstanding religious
groups now functioning on cam-
pus approved the charter and the
constitution and became member
organizations of the Federation
which will attempt to correlate
the work of all of them.

‘The Student Chrstian ‘Federa-

tion has been in ‘the. formative
0 “Esau. tor. at number of iiim.°nths—

  

Participating in the religious
council will be: The Rodger Wil-
liams Fellowship, local Baptist
group; the Canterbury Club, or-
ganization for Episcopalian stu-
dents; the Lutheran Student As-
sociation, religious club for Luth-
erans in the Greater Pittsburgh
Area; the Methodist organizations;
the Presbyterian group; the

YMCA, and the YWCA.

Every student who is a mem-
ber of one of these participating
groups under the rules and con-
stitutions of that particular group
is automatically a member of the
Student Christian Federation.

In order to facilitate the bus-
iness of the SCF and bring about
closer harmony among these
clubs, the new Federation has
established a Council whichiwill

by each club or a 21-person Coun-
cil.

The Student Christian Federa-
tion will be affiliated with the
World Student Christian Federa-
Ktion and the American branch of
that organization, the United Stu-
dent Christian Council.

At the meeting Friday evening,
the Rev. Frank Hutchison and the
Rev. J. Victor Murtland were ask-
ed to be advisors to the all-cam-
pus religious council. Rev. Hutch-
ison is assistant pastor at the
Shadyside Presbyterian Church
and chaplain to Presbyterian stu-
dents attending the University.
Rev. Murtland is the full—time
campus pastor to Lutheran stu-
dents at Pitt. Both have been in-
strumental in instigating the for-

UNPLEASANT REMINDER
We don't want to spoil your vacation but we have a little
"reminder for you.

Just in case you’ve happily forgotten about it, the new

University Fee of $12.50 per semester goes into effect with the
forthcoming Registration. -

J Remember now-‘.3 The Fee was tacked ontl) every student’s
bill last October along with a $1 per credit increase in the
price of tuition. The tuition boost you won’t” have to worry
about until next September. Seniors can just forget about
it. ‘ '
4 But the University Fee will be collected for this semester.
Its purpose, in case you’ve forgotten that, too, is to defray
capital expenditures by the University. That includes money
spent for desks, lab equipment and a number of other high cost
items.

We’re not going over this again merely. to be unpleasant.
It’s just that we don’t want anyone to start throttling the
minions of the Treasurer’s office when they are. It might hold
up theline.

START or CAMPUS LIFE

V\7hen DeSoto Hall opens next week it could well mark
the beginning of an important change in University policy.‘
Heretofore it has been the attitude of the administration that

the University was designed to serve the educational needs of
the Pittsburgh community. They didn’t feel that it was neces-
sary to service the entire \Vestern Pennsylvania district.

There was ‘much to be said for their stand. /The sudden
postwar rush for education taxed the University ’s capacity so‘
much that any admission of other than Pittsburgh students
meant turning away young people from .the city. In addition
the rocketing enrollments made it imperative that spare time
and moneybe devoted to construction of classroom and labor-
atory facilities rather than to building living quarters for o11t-
of-town students.

It’s easy to understand why the University acted as it did.
But the consequences haven’t been pleasant—either for the
students’ or the school. There has developed a huge body of
students Whose only concern in the University is getitng in ‘and
o11t of class as quickly as possible. They don’t care about the
University. W0l‘St of all, they don’t even know it.

VVhat is one rather small dormitory going to do about
that? One isn’t going to do much of anything,_ but a" large group
of them will. They’ll give some students at least an interest
in their school. They’ll give them at least a small group of
friends with whom they can associate yvhile they are at school.
It will give them something of theiatmosphere of college life
that is so conspicuously absent ‘now. And by providing some
of these things it will give the University some more earnest
boosters among its alumni, and an enhanced reputation in the
community. _

Vlfith the backlog ofgveterans all but gone_ it will soon be
time for the University to begin thinking about drawing in
students from beyond the city’s borders. It isn’t too much to
hope that in a few years 25 to 30 per cent of Pitt’s student
body would come from places outside the immediate Pitts-
burgh district, and that these outsiders will be house in Uni-
versity-owned and operated dormitories. That could and should

, be the case. It will be the case unless the administration: de-
éides to call itquits after providing DeSoto Hall.

s of  
Registration

By rA'r SEGER

Last Monday, the ‘Commons
Room overﬁowed with a collection
of half-hysterical, card—hungry
Pittites. Only one thing entered
the minds of the bearers of the lit-
tle registration kits: get those
cards! So began one of the wildest
sessions of pushing and shoving:
this school has
known in many a registration.

It was getting into‘ this latter
line which produced excitement
and bargaining heretofore un-

and pinching

known in the Commons Room.
Four" deep at mostipoints( this line
twisted around several corners
and grew, strangely

from the front.

enough,

Sleepy Moss

Beginning earlier‘ than I 8:30,
streams of sleepy students, hus-
tled into the Commons Room and‘
headed in the direction of,tables
housing cards of their choice. By
the time the ﬁrst class started, the
indoor campus of this University
was one mass of men and women
all headed in different directions,
all blocking one” another’s way,
and all determined to get there
ﬁrst.

The long lines twining in and
out of the ‘arches and about the
rim of the room reminded most
students of. one thing: registra-
tion before the simpliﬁed system
got underway! U '

Hardest hit were the psychology
and English lines. At a rough
guess, I judge that almost every
student in this school is taking
at least one or more courses next
term in each of the two mentioned
departments. The English depart-
ment had its line staggered in
three sections. One for freshmen
English, and one for sophomore
courses. The third, of course, was
for ‘other’ English an.d journalism.

Holes’ in ‘fhe Floor -

‘ People in the rear of this line
wore large round holes in the
iﬂoor just standing‘ there, readying
their feet for the surge forward.
Silly people. The’ correct way -to
(approach the situation was, of
course, with a running start from
the opposite wall, head first, pro-
truding into the front of the line,
So far, there have been no reports
of broken necks. How or why, I’ll
never know. ‘

Ci-owning blow hit most stu-
dents when they sauntered into

0’clock to ﬁnd the lines gone, and
many of the wanted class cards
still in abundance. To think, all
the barbaric bumping earlier in
the day was almost unnecessary.

The worst of registration is
-over, though, and the’ long lines
will be less frantic over at the
Mosque during the period of ﬁnal
registration, or most of the want-
ed class cards have already been
secured. Even though the sim-
pliﬁed°system almost took the
shape and formof the pre-simpli-
ﬂed days last Monday morning,
we know better now. Registrar J.
G. Quick and his able assistants
have this thing down to a rath-
er smooth-running system.

Only unfortunate feature is the
fact that there are still a few sen-
iors‘ mumbling about not being-

For Mexican Students _

By ARTHUR FEDEL

From south of the border comes a sy_stem of giving examina-

tions that is unique and effective.

Rebecca Felkel, Pitt student from Monterey, Mexico, tells us
of the ﬁchero, a cylinder which is the basis of the method.

The ﬁchero is used in the Bachilleres, schools incorporated in
the University of the state of Nuevo Leon, Mexico.

Inside the ﬁchero are small,

half-spheres which resemble a

split chewing gum ball, called ﬁchas. On the ﬂat side of the ﬁchas

a number is printed.

I

The ﬁchero, when set up, is about the same as a carnival chuck-

. a-luck game. You— spin the ﬁchero and when it stops spinning,

you press a button to release one:
of. the ﬁchas.

In the words of Miss Felkel,
“You spin the ﬁchero and worry
until it stops.”
~ The number on your ﬁcha is
the number of the question you
have to answer.

The questions are from a list of
study questions that the students
are given ‘at the end of classes in
May. After a study of ﬁfteen days
the ﬁchero begins to spin.

All the exams are oral. and the
number“ of times you spin the
ﬁchero is determined by how well
you answer the questions. The
board of professors who proctor
the exams are, according to Miss
Felkel “hard to fool.”

This is easily explained, since
the board of professors usually
consists of the instructor the stu-
dents had for the year, a professor
from the University, and one or

two professors the student did
not have. -

Grades are passed out the day
the exam is given. Your spinning
and waiting for grades is all over
in one day.

This system of examining would
undoubtedly be popular at Pitt.
It would give a continental air to
the school. »

However, it might attract some

gambling gets in your blood.

Tom Ryan’s Student Congress
Poll Committee is to obtain stu-
dent attitude on the» Student
Union‘ Committee’s choice of the
eighth ﬂoor, and to list facilities
desired by them.

Included in the University’s
long range building program is a
genuine Student Union Building
-for use exclusively by student
activities. This is charted to be
erected on the campus along with
other buildings in the current ex-
pansion program of the Univer-

The eighth ﬂoor Student Union,
to be ready by spring, will be
used as an idea and project cen-
ter for the yet to be built Union
Building, Saalbach stated.

The dean of men and his staff
at present have the. eighth ﬂoor
well integrated as an activities
center and will have it solidly
organized in the new Student
Union this spring, according to
the assistant dean of men.

Expected to Be Typical

To give an idea of what will be
in the proposed Student Union

Western Basketball Officials
May Give reak to Panthers

By MYRON KOPELMAN
If western basketball ofﬁciating is really what it is cracked up
_to be, the win-minded Pitt Panthers have all the more reason to

, hope for a few upsets on their coming western trip.

1 .

I
;..
‘.
,.

Western officials are supposed to favor the offense on close
blocking plays, a policy which is just the opposite of the defensively-
sympathetic ‘eastern system.

For many years Dr. H. C. Carlson, Pitt coach, has griped that

* * * the officials too frequently con-
vict his boys of illegal offensive
blocking. He maintains that such
convictions are miscarriages of
justice. _

Much Screening

Carlson’s “ﬁgure eight” system
of offensive play is characterized
by much screening and racing
down the foul line. The officials
into

running opposing players

innocent bystanders.

Despite reports that western of-
ﬁcials tend to blame the defen-
sive player,’Carlson says that he
doubts whether his team will gain
any deﬁnite advantage in the
west. ~

But since one point frequently
means the margin of "victory, the
change in officiating style may re-
sult in an upset or two for the
Panthers. The Panthers, owning
eight wins in 11 contests, are of
the opinion that they can make

takes place Saturday with Brad-
ley as the host at Peoria, Illi-

Carlson Optimistic

Dr. Carlson is outwardly op-
timistic about the trip. “We’ve
nothing to lose, and everything to
gain. My boys are young and fast.
Why, prior to the age of 30 one
has everything to look forward
to."

Pessimists claim that despite the
winning record of the Panthers,
they have not beaten any teams
of importance.

The Pitts are probably aware
of that"fact, but winning habits
are deﬁnitely advantages even
when a team is playing the na-
tion’s best.

Busby, touted as the Cleve-
lander’s hotshot, heads the visit-
ing contingent which is pretty
well balanced even though‘ it de-
pends heavily on the Sprinting
ace, who is quite a record breaker.
Petro Balances

But Pitt has a ﬁre of their own
to ﬁght the Cleveland ﬁreball in
the person of Dandy Dick Petro,
who is. an All-American free-
styler in his own right and breaks
his share of records.
“It looks like some records are

-going to fall Friday,” commented

Grady. digging into his ﬁle of Pitt
swimming marks. “It’ll be a
great meet, and we’ll hold our
own.”

Grady may turn out to be a
prophet. Just a look at Busby’s
augurs well
for a record-smashing evening.

‘Betters’ Record

He turned in the amazing time
of 51.9 seconds in the 100-yard
dash, in a national meet at Yale,
which would eclipse the present
Pitt record by 2.2 seconds.

Busby can lay claim to quite
a list of other accomplishments,

past performances

including a junior National 50-!

yard title, and an impressive
third in his heat in the Olympic
tryouts.

In the Panthers ﬁrst two meets,
Petro has not been sufficiently
pressed, but against Busby, Dick
will have to go all out and may
surprise with a record show of
his own.

However, the Pitt ace has been
bothered with a pulled muscle
from a wrestling mishap, and
may not be in top swimming
form. Grady is hoping, though,
that.his tall speed merchant is
ready for Friday.

under a bushel the past fall,
won’t be new to the job. Several
times during the ’48 season. he
was called on for shorter, more
accurate kicks and was quite a
toe-man in his high school days
at Williamsport.

Incidentally, the square-jawed
DePasqua was a close runner-up

-to Bill McPeak for the Ow1’s

“most valuable player” award, ac-
cording to the -balloting of his
teammates.

Williams sided with Columbia’s
Lou Little, the leading advocate
of the new rule, in the substitu-
tion dates in California. He puts
his reasons this way:

.“Continua-1 substitution breaks
up the continuity of the team
that’s in there. It tak-es their ini-
tiative away. If the coach is con-
stantly sending in plays with
substitutes, the boys are left hold-
ing the bag if he. doesn’t call one.
Usually, then, they try to guess
what play he would use. That
often doesn’t work out too well.”

What the sports world needs is more men of Dean Thorn’s

have the courage to defy the “right of the customers” to boo.
The point being made here, however, is not that booing

the booer is usually sitting twice

as far from the play as the booed.
Nor is the impropriety stressed be-
cause the average fan knows half
as much about the game as the

 zas consider the possibility of ofﬁ-
‘cials possessing self—respect.

’ The main point, rather, is that
ii game of ball is not quite the best
place_ at which to boo.

In order to execute a healthy
boo, it is necessary ﬁrst to cup
the hands to the mouth, pucker
the lips, stretch the neck, and then
i , let ‘loose. The act possesses a cer-
tain similarity'to an ape exercis-
ing his vocal chords while dang-
ling from the limb of a tree. Any-
one who is willing to let himself
look like an ape because some

quence? Surgeons make slips of

speaking at the United Nations

SAE held the lead throughout the first half and left the floor,

holding a 9-7 edge. Only Bob Horner’s three buckets on long push
shots kept the Phi Gams in the ball game.

McPeakSigns
With Browns

The Cleveland Browns of the
All—America pro league were this
week in possession of the signed
contract of Bin McPeak, four
years a varsity end at the Um-
versity. '

Draft rights to McPeak in the
National League were held by
the local Pittsburgh Steelers, who
selected him in the 1947 draft.
The six-foot 195—pound terminal
will be graduated in June.

McPeak and Leo Skladany
paired up as Pitt’s regular ends
for the past three seasons, form-.
ing one of the nation’s most
formidable defensive terminal
duos. Skladany will graduate with
McPeak.

Draft rights to Skladany are
held by Philadelphia in the Na-
tional League and San Francisco
in the All—American Conference.

McPeak spent two weeks at
Notre Dame in 1944 before enlist-
ing in the Naval Air Corps. He
was later discharged, however,
because of high blood pressure,
andenrolled at Pitt in 1945.

Captain of the Panthers for two
years, the lank end is 22 years
old and comes rom nearby New
Castle, Pa. He performed this
month in San Francisco’s East-
West game.

"‘Candida,” will be held on Feb.
10 and 11.

Tryouts are scheduled in 1217
C1, from 3 to 5 p. m., and from
7 to 9 p. m.

Any registered student at the
University is eligible to try for a
part in the play.. -

Candida is a romantic comedy
of manners. The setting’ of this
satire on mid—Victorian life is in
London. ' " g

The plot revolves around the
conﬂict presented to the heroine,
Candida, a mature middle—class
Englishwoman. She is suddenly
fagedwith making a choice be-
tween her staid clergyman hus-
band, and a youthful poet friend
of her husband.

The nineteenth century play is
in striking contrast to the Pitt
Players’ ﬁrst production of this
season, the ‘modern comedy, “The
Philadelphia Story.”

Positions are also open on all
the crews, including scenery, cos-
tumes, lighting, make-up, and
stage. Applicants for these crews
are asked to come to the tryouts
on Feb. 10 and 11.

. The Players’ last production of
the year, “Dark of the Moon,” will
not be cast at this time.

Writing «Contests

Professor Edwin L. Peterson
of the English department has
announced that the deadline
for second submissions to the
Doubleday short story contest
has been set at Feb. 14. They
may be left at his office in 328
CL.

He also made known that the
deadline for the English d,e-
partment’s annual literary mag-
azine, MSS, will be Feb. 18.
Mr. Peterson emphasized that
submission of articles and poe-
try have received the least re-
Sponse from students so far. He
claimed the magazine wouldn't
be published unless the quality
of material improves, and the
amount submitted rises.

United World Feaera:;s+.c;v..

Solution for Ills of Today's World

A small group of students here are sure there’s a-remedy foi¢

some of the ills of today’s world, and want to do something about it.

Listed as Pitt Chapter of United World Federalists, they are
part of a world group which is working for ultimate peace through

a single world government.

According to the UWF, peace is deﬁned as “not merely the
absenceof war, but the presence of justice, of law, of order in short,

of government and the institutions#

of government.” This should be a
“world federal government, uni-
’ versal and strong enough to pre-
vent armed conﬂict between na-
tions, and having direct jurisdic-
tion over the individual in those
i. matters within its authority.”

The UWF hope to achieve their
goal by making use of the amend-
ment processed of the United Na-
tions to transform it into such a
world government; by participat-
ing in world constituent assem-
blies seeking to draft constitutions

 

‘‘I always smoke
Chesteriields because they're

for possible adoption by the United
Nations.

The government proposed by
the UWF would be based on the
following principles (1) Member-
ship: open at all times to all na-
tions without right of secession.
(2) Reservation of Powers: all
powers not delegated to the world
government to be reserved for the
nations and their peoples. |(3)

Enforcement of World Law: di-
rectly enforcable upon individu-
als.

(4) Balanced Representation:

t_j1L[_l and they taste good

It's M1 cigarette.”

formula recognizing population,

cational level. (5) Bill of Rights.
(6) Revenue: authority to raise

dependable revenue under direct
taxing pow.er independent of na-
tional taxation. (7) Amendments:
provisions for amendments of the
constitution.

John Spanos, president of the
Pitt chapter is urging the support
and interest of Pitt students and
faculty. He is organizing weekly
meetings featuring talks by fac-
ulty members. Students have the
opportunity of exchanging ideas
with faculty members in an in-
formal discussion conducted by
each speaker.
