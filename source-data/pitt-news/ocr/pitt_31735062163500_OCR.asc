A three-step procedure to present appeals has been outlined by’-

Discrimination Topic _

Of TudenLas t Lecture

LAST LECTURE LECTURER Dr. Arthur Tuden wasthe prophet~
on Monday that tried to convince his audience that the Negroes
are downtrodden and that something should be done about the
present state of affairs. The students had heard similar pleas C
from other prophets at other timeswithout ~reacting,_ neither did
they respond to Dr. Tuden when he beseeched them. ’

"By Nancy Delaney ,

The prophet sang in the wilderness: “Uproot your basic
structure and drastically revise yourlallocation of material
goods, America, and be saved from the plague of discrimina-
tion.” Thus spoke Dr. Arthur Tuden at Monday’s Last Lec-
ture.

I

Acutely scrutinizing the society around him, the prophet
observed its folly: sit—ins are ﬁne,
but the real need is for jobs and

Education to relieve the consistent
problem of poverty and discrimi-
nation for the great. mass of
Negroes. “Strike out at the
causes,” he recommended, in an
admonishing tone. “_Repent.. Be
virtuous.” But how? The prophet
was strangely silent.

the University’s administrative committee on, discrimination atpan
organizational meeting. A ~

The committee, according to Chairman Dr. W. Edward Seel,
will not hear anyappeals until the person presenting the case has
exhausted normal administrative channels.

For example, astudent who has acomplaint might ﬁrst go to‘ 5
the dean of men or women. If the student is. not satisﬁed with the. .,
action taken by this person, he may go to Dr. Alan C. Rankin, assist-'
ant chancellor for student and general affairs. If the student is stillW ‘

not satisﬁed, he may then present his case to the committee.
' ‘ l » For Faculty‘ and Students A _ M
The committee is for students and faculty. A faculty member

would go to the appropriate clean or department head before asking’

the committee to take action. , , ’ .
_ If anyone is not sure to whom to refer his case of alleged.

discrimination,‘ he may go to the committee, which will refer _ A

the case to the proper administrative channels. . .- .
The committee will also hear appeals from people witnessing‘

acts of alleged discrimination, if the_ witness feels ‘that the person‘ 
. who mighthave been discriminated against would not ﬁle a complaint. "

; 5, .-

.Appeal -in Writing ~ V ' ' ..,

Once a person has taken his case through normal‘ channels; ifs:

he is still not satisﬁed with "the action taken he could then ﬁle .an

appeal with the committee.‘ This appeal should be in writing and I

addressed‘ to ‘Dr. Sell.

The appeal should state thefacts, and circumstances of the
alleged discrimination as well as the chronology of steps taken,
to solve the problem. « ' A‘ ‘

- The chronology would enumerate thosepeople spoken to about

inthe attempted solution. ~
' Hearing Arranged

After the written appeal is ﬁled, a hearing date will be arranged}.
by the committee. .

The plaintiff and defendant may appear at. the hearing. Any
party involved will be entitled to bring witnesses who can con- .
tribute -to, the case. n Hearings are closed to spectators.

_A student observer, appointed by Student Government, will be A

present at any hearings" that involve students.

Student Working'Abroa(l
' 1 Discovers First Chance
To Develop His Initiative

By NANCY FUCHS .

After two years as a volunteer in Chile,
~Thomas Paulick regards the Peace ‘Corps as a
two-way avenue: “I feel as though I’ve helped
out down there, and it has helped me.”

Paulick, a 1961 Notre Dame graduate with
his BA in political science, was willing to go

anywhere with the Peace Corps; he was sent to

a rural board-
ing school out—
side of Santi-
ago, Chile. He
.taught history,
2 e 0 g 1’ 3 '
phy, mathema-
tics, and sports
to 18’ and 19-
farm

three or four

out the coun-
try operated
by the Insti-
tute, of Rural
Education, Paulick explained. “It was situ-
ated in a one-story adobe building several
hundred years old which had once been the
main building of a large fundo (farm).”
“The most difﬁcult thing I had to do was
teach a physical education class at 6:30 a.m. six
' days a week.” He managed the soccer team, “the
big sport” in South America, and taught track
and ﬁeld, and basketball. “I played basketball
with a team of workers and teachers called the
‘All Stars of Rancagua’ (a town ﬁve miles from
the fundo); we made the national ﬁnals,” he

‘ ‘announced with a note of pride.

Paulick believes the opportunity to travel
during his summer vacation is a deﬁnite ad-
vantage to the Peace Corps. “I was able to
see every country in South America except
Colombia.” _ 2

Of Chile, Paulick feels that rural life moves
at the speed of an ox-cart. But there is spirit,
and a great deal more nationalism there. I was
impressed by the democratic elections and na-
tional holidays.” ' -

He calls the Chileans “warm, friendly, good
matured,” and maintains that he “never ran
"into trouble ‘of any kind.” In the rural areas

' the language the‘ people speak is not the Span-
ish you read in books. They have a smaller
vocabulary; their language is distorted.”

    

TWO FAC o,te thousan tat hveJ'0m- Cops
and have benefitted, Thomas Paulick-and James Lancaster. .

James Lancaster made a discovery during his
two years as a Peace Corps volunteer in Nigeria:
“For the ﬁrst time in my life I had a chance to
use initiative, to be resourceful.” _

A 1961 graduate from Howard University
where he majored in economics and African
studies, Lancaster went with the first volunteers
  ‘ to go to Niger-
ia. After three
months practice
teaching in Iba—
dan, he taught

phy, history,
E n g 1 i s h, and
F r e n c h in I a
boys’ boarding
school in . Ka-
duna, northern

, years of educa- Nigeria, Eng-
. tion b e h i I1 (1 lish was the
them. language spo— '
“The school ken in t h e
was one of school.
15 through- “Because

Nigeria has
such a short-
age of teach-
ers, I was re-
sponsible for working with the ministry of
education to set up educational television,”
Lancaster explained. .

Lancaster toured the “bush” country in a
jeep, visiting the homes of 100 of his students.
At‘ the villages where he stopped on his’5,000
mile, 8 Week trip, he participated in ‘nightly
festivals and "taped indigenal music. He esti-
mates he received “2l8 chickens, 260 eggs, and

-a whole stalk of bananas” throughout his trip. .

“I have collected and written a number of
folk-tales and a history of Nigerian villages
which I may incorporate into book form,”
Lancaster explained. ,

Awed by the rapid and constant changes in
Nigeria’s modernization, Lancaster remarked,
“What Congress passes here in one year, the gov-
ernment in Nigeria does in one week!”

“A Peace Corps volunteer feels fully pro-
ductive. When the day is over, you feel ex-
hausted with a sense of 'hapiness and ful-
ﬁllment. _

“Now, for the ﬁrst time in my life, I have
so many opportunities to choose from. I hope

to go back to Nigeria next year, after I receive
mymasters; from the Graduate School of Public
and International‘ Affairs here. I want to work
and study abroadbut I don’t wantto lose contact
with my heritage.”

Middle Class Interests

Leaders of both races are in.
terested in the middle class posi-
tions. Who isdealing with the
problems of the mass? Tuden does

not know- where to turn. The  I

NAACP, "although doing an excel-
lent job, is more concerned about

with whom they can. buy shoes,

than with what.

The Black Muslim movement
does seem to guarantee eco-
nomic support and training to
its members. It presents them
with a uniﬁed view and. an
identityas a Negro. It cannot,
however, absorb all the Negroes
in America.

The outlook is not one of doom,
however. When forced to work to-
gether, as they were inthe armed

forces, people discriminate less.

This function could be performed
through the corporations if only
individuals would be filtered out
on the basis of talent, not class.

Review:OurLadyofTheFlowers

By MATTHEW NESVISKY

Our Lady of the Flowers
(Grove Press, 318 pp., $6.50)
not only was written by Jean
Genet, it was written of, to
and for Jean Genet.‘ To read
the book is tointrduce —- to
stare lengthily —— into the very
mind and soul of a talented and
terrible writer. .

First published in 1943, this
book is the ﬁrst novel of the
controversial Frenchman who has
since become better known for
his plays, notably The Balcony
and The Blacks. The" ﬁrst-person
narrative was written during one
of Genet’s ‘many periods of im-
prisonment; it is .a rambling,
chaotic but sincere dramatization‘

'of the psychic elements of the

author — a man who, by reaching
a level of pure introspection,
reaches a‘level of pure amorality.
Not Inventions '

The “characters” in his f‘story”
are not inventions of the author
but are the author himself. Genet
establishes himself as both God
and Man, madly mapping the

miseries of his peoplesand con-i

sequently suffering along _with
them. The purpose of all this is
to discover the Truth that is
Genet. .

Through the ﬁgures which
Genet generates, we see a se-
quence of attitudes and opinions
which constitute the author’s
mind. If the ﬁgures are not
pretty ones, then neither is
Genet; \but he would be the
ﬁrst to tell as this; indeed, he
does tell us in this book.

‘These manifestations of Genet’s
poetic ,imagination—Divine, Dar-
ling Daintyfoot, Gabriel, Our

Lady of the Flowers — are what
we would consider the lowest and

the most perverted that society is
capable of producing. Thieves,
murderers, pimps and whores,
they are tortured and given salva-
tion again and again by Genet. He
does it through sex, the author’s
means of both being 'God and
seeing God. .
' Weaving Splinters
-Thus the characters," splinters
of Genet’s own mind, weave their
way through life or rather through
a series of sensations: journeys to
and from dream-hopes that
parallel the sex act itself. The
book virtually sags with sexual
symbolism, from the objects and
scenes described to the rhythm of‘
the sentences to the choice of
words. . -
’It is the authors. choice‘of
words which sayes the book.
The bubbles of poetic genius
which frequently bob to the
surface of the writing protect
the book from’ being labeled
pornographic, although it is ob-
scene. It is Genet’s talent in this
area alone that continually
draws the reader onward from
one sequence to the next. _ _
Jean-Paul Sartre’s 57-page in-
troduction to the novel is illumi-
nating in many ways, but in its
tendency to categorize and pigeon-

hole the elements of the work, the

result is an unsatisfactory over-
‘simpliﬁcation. - One point which
Sartre touches upon but never
fully, answers is why the book

was written._ One wonders why"

Genet, so involved in the universe
of pleasure and pain within him-
self, would be moved to publish a

book on the subject of the world-

he has rejected.

Cafeteria to Open

For Study

A motion has been passed by
Student 4 Government to .open
the Schenley Cafeteria in the
"evening for study purposes.

Plans call- for the cafeteria
to be used for study 7:30 p.m.
to midnight, Monday through
Friday, and‘ 6 to 10 p.m. Sun-
day.

Two proctors, selected from
SG, Associated Women" Stu-
dents Scholastic Committee, or
the student body at large, will
be present to enforce quiet
study conditions and open and
close the cafeteria. Proctor ap-
pointments will be subject to
approval‘ by SG.

Students will not be per-
mitted to use cafeteria glasses,
and will be required to empty
ash trays when leaving the
study room.

That kind of life is.

_ _ In theieditorialiappearing in the November 11 issue of The Pitt News, we ap-
gplauded Interfraternity Counci1’s announcement of plans to publish a course evalution
bookletfsimilar to ones in print at anumber of ivy league schools.’ At that time, We
recomrnended that all student» organizations on campus pledge their support of this
worthwhile project and that work should begin immediately due to the extensiveness _

 
    

y ‘it appears that SG had a similar project in the ﬁre
‘and was forced to alter its plans in order to cooperate more fully with the group

; _ Now, however, the Liberal Arts Cabinet has come out against the idea, stating
 that the project in mind will take much more work and time than either IFC or SG
 seem to realize, and Dr. Albert B. Martin, dean of the Liberal Arts,-appears to favor -
.,-the manner in which the Cabinet wishes to handle the case. . 1 i “
 Independently each of the organizations has a valuable idea, but in order for
 the" total effort to have a forceful end,’ the degree and means of interaction should be 3 _

 " The current President of
these United States possesses
A . great intelligence, wit, and po-
, litical savvy, Even his enemies
, grant that he is a formidable
‘opponent in debates, on “non-
. '.political” tours, and during
campaign travels. He possesses
a “glamor” which appeals to
 fthe- feminine population of
America and a vigorous ap-
proach to his work which’ is
com_mendable in a man born
extremely rich. Yet, except for
those ‘closest to him as political
‘ associates and friends, John F.
 Kennedy has not been called a
_“great” President. The truth is,
he isn’t"a great President, and
‘ s ‘ shows diminishing prospects of
becoming one; , "
A Kennedy 'is*highly ‘compe-
‘3 "tent; hehandles his job with
responsibility and care. He has
‘i selected ﬁne men to serve in
his administration, and the
MacNamaras and Buridys and
 Rusks have been all that ﬁne
civil servants should be. Still,
people have the feeling that an
x_;_element of -greatness is missing;
liberals feel somehow betrayed
' and frustrated — Kennedy is
“potentially great, but . . .”
What are our requirements for
a President to be called great?
What must=he do andibe?
.Clint_on Rossiter, a famous
‘student of the Presidency, has
enumerated: the following sev-
‘ en qualities for Presidential
{ ’ success, not greatness. — for
Rossiter claims_ greatness can
only be judged by later gen-
erations: Bounce (vitality and
elasticity), Political Skill (per-
suasion), Cunning, The News-
paper Habit, A Sense of Hu-

",people),‘' and‘ e ‘Sense of ‘His-

 

’--mor, Aif'a’bi1ity‘_(c'aring about-

-Nuinerous‘ episodes have
’ hat M K --

sick noristupid, dull nor closed *

to the world, ‘fumbling nor
meek. . R \ I

The sixth characteristic, Af-
fability, might be a clue to Mr.

Kennedy’s failings as a Presi- ~

dent — but this is altogether
beyond -the realm of exact
analysis. Suiﬁce it to say-that

(he is not a “man of the peo-

ple.” He possesses more intel-
lectuality than heart; more

,precision than passion. He is,

truly, ‘a Child of this Century
—— in the ﬁgurative as well as
the literal sense — and lacks
the warmth of earlier genera-
tions. But other Presidents
have been less than personable.
Many of our great Presidents
were alone much of the time —
and often misunderstood by the
public — Lincoln and Wilson
for example. What quality

. brought these men into success,

and then greatness?

This quality is a Sense of
History, a feeling of the ex-
alting thought that, as Rossi-
ter put it, “he sits in Lincoln’s
seat” and that “no man or
combination of men can match
his power to inﬂuence history.”
Does Mr. Kennedy act as
though he feels this “cast of
mind?” Last Thursday, at his
news conference, the President
calmly, and with little dismay,
admitted the death of the tax-
cut bill and the civil rights bill
in this session.of Congress. He
was upset, he said, but an “18
month delivery” would see the
bills through, next year. Dur-
ing this past summer, before
the President left for his Eu-
ropean tour, the White House
announced that it was agree-

‘ able to an additional $500 mil-

lion cut in its foreign aid re-
,'quest;. The President has told

It seems they are not crucial
because John Kennedy, even

  Puppets and Things
  O       A C By Bernie Trumpower

About the puppets. Don’t think you need to know how they
became puppets. Just try to know what .came before them. Since"
youimight not recall, and it is a debated thing when it comes out
in‘ writing, I’ll tryyto explain what came before the puppets.

It was a time back in another dimension. The. animals then‘
had not reached the point of evolution as the‘
puppets. But instead’they had these confusing‘ in
ways about them. One aspect they called “reli- 7

. gion.” It’ll be enough just to say that though they
were the same species and varied so slightly in

About the religion thing. - I _,

One of the unfortunate things about them
was that they did notice slight differences among
themselves.
they were aware of different ways among them-

bated at length over which was right or wrong.

 

selves of making sounds. They were in a state of -ﬂux over different A

colours among the species. _.

Probably one of the-greatest areas of awareness was that half
of the species looked upon the other half with some semblance of
awe because there was this discriminating factor-_ as to which ‘half
gave rise to the young. A measure of the tremendous ability to

i adapt is that puppets no longer have that weakness. . J

The individual animal then was somewhat a strange thing too
External stimuli brought such unpredictable reactions. Like puppets,
these animals had eyes, but one of the primitive aspects about them
was" that some forms of stimuli brought a water solution into
their eyes. There was also this spontaneous reaction called laughter.
But fortunately that -was not so deeply geneticallygrooted, thus it
was soon removed in the adaptive process.

Their greatest weakness .-— the" one which soon proved their

elimination — was also the one by which they managed to remove '

all these primitive mannerisms. You might have read, it was this
process called reason. When ﬁnally ‘they got around to bringing it

to lightthrough their technology of?biology, they began to see the.
need to rid themselves through various methods of all these devia-s . ’

tions frornthe norm. .. 1 V
It did take quite a bit of ingenuity, being the ﬁrst time adap-

tation was selectively‘ determined through realization, but in just _

a few ages they brought themselves to the point where conformity
was achieved. Now that it is such that they locate themselves on
these strings, they no longer have to contend with that weakness.
Yes, there is that one thing you may have noticed — you know,
the thing about some of the strings being longer than some of the
others — but have faith, the puppets can rid themselves of this
weakness too. Soon the-lengths will be the same. It could not be

tolerated. Because by their nature, puppets just aren’t that way.

SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE
AND JAZZ LIKE THAT

I anrrnoyv an elderly gentleman, full of years and aches, but
my thoughts keep ever turning to my undergraduate days. This
is called “arrested development.”

But I cannot stop the healing tide of nostalgia that washes
over me as I recall those golden campus days, those ivy-covered

_’ buildings (actually, at my college, there was only ivy: no bricks)‘,

those pulse-tingling lectures on John Dryden and Cotton
Mather, the many friends I made, the many deans I bit.
I know some of you are already dreading the day when you

my pleasant task today to assure you that it need not be so;
all you have to do is join the Alumni Association and every year
you will receive a bright, newsy, chatty bulletin, chock-full of
tidings about your old buddies. .

Oh, what a red-letter day it is at\m“y house, the day the
Alumni Bulletin arrives! I_. cancel all my engagements, take the
phone off the hook, dismiss my resident osteopath, put the
cheetah outside, and settle down for an evening of pure pleasure
with the Bulletin and (need I add?) a good supply of Marlboro
Cigarettes. » » '

Whenever I am having fun, a Marlboro makes the fun even
more fun. That ﬁlter, that ﬂavor, that yielding soft pack, that

.. ﬁrm Flip Top box, never fails to heighten my pleasure whether

I am playing Double Canﬁeld or watching the radio or knitting

C an afghan or enjoying any other diverting pursuit you might
name-except, of course, spear ﬁshing. Butvthen, how much _

spear ﬁshing does one do in Clovis, New Mexico, where I live?

But I digress. Let us return to my Alumni Bulletin and the
fascinating news about my old friends and classmates. I quote
from the current issue: ,

“Well, fellow alums, it certainly has been a. wing-dinger of a
year for us old grads! Remember Mildred Cheddar and Hanry
Camembert, those crazy kids who always held hands in Econ II?
Well, they’re married now and living in Clovis, New Mexico,

where Harry rents spear-ﬁshing equipment, and Mildred has just

given birth to a lovely 28-pound daughter, her second in four
months. Nice going, Mildred and Harry!

“Remember Jethro Brie, the man we voted most likelyito it

he was voted ‘Motorman of the Year’ by his fellow workers in
the Duluth streetcar system. ‘I owe it all to my

  Should Be Higher

Athletic director Frank Carver says he was not parti-
cularly disappointed with the attendance at last Satur-
day’s game. “We had hoped for a few thousand more, but
we’re not real disappointed with the showing,” Carver
said. I can’t help but disagree. It seems that when the
nation’s ﬁfth ranked team is playing the nation’s 12th
ranked team there should be more than 49,000 people in
the stands. The people who call Pittsburgh a good sports
town had better look the situation over a little more care-

=I= =11 *

One attendance ﬁgure that has not been lacking is
the number of students at the game. Pitt athletic business
manager "Kenny George reports that 4,359 students at-
tended the Army game. Other games also had good stu-
dent support. There were 3,777 students at the Syracuse
game, 3,519 at the Washington game and 3,184 at the

* *

Some of the students are becoming ‘over-enthus-
iastic in their support of the team. I had occasion to
V visit the student section before the game, before
taking my usual seat in the press box. Somehow I lost
the steps and had to make my way over the bleachers
;towards ﬁeld level. Every few steps I took I ran into a
rope with a couple of: boys behind it saying, “Sorry
these seats are saved.” 0
Some group, either administrative or student, should
take steps to see that these seat saving practices are aban-
doned during the Penn State game where the biggest stu-
dent crowd of the season is expected. ‘
' ‘ * * *
The picture below was sent to us by a mad Panther
football fan, Marty Samuels. A 1962 graduate here, Sam-
uels now attends West Virginia graduate school. As can

» be seen he has lost none of his enthusiasm for hisalma

mater. He claims the headline should come true since the
Panthers beat three West Coast teams and the Coast
teams seem intent on ﬁnishing with as poor record as
, possible. “It’s only fair,” Samuels says, “besides, we have
the best team in the country.” » '

=t~ * *

Post Gazette sports editor Al Abrams was right
the other day when he called Rick Leesonthe Pan-
thers’ most underrated player. This may sound
strange since Leeson gets quite a bit of publicity. Still
his efforts have been somewhat put in the back-
ground by Paul Martha and Fred Mazurek. Leeson,
however, gets the important yardage for the Panthers
and is doing some very ﬁne blocking also.

* * *

One of the amazing aspects of this year‘s Panther

team is that the first unit has remained intact-for the

entire season. This doesn’t mean there hasn’t been quite‘

a battle for the starting jobs, but John Michelosen is
rightfully hesitant about breaking up a winning combina-
tion. ' i

The most hotly contested spot on the team is the

second unit right guard position where Jim Irwin and V

Bernie LaQuinta are battling. Irwin had the job" in the
early part of the season, but LaQuinta cameion to push

, When asked to compare Fred Mazurek with

say. “It’s senseless to compare anyone with Staubach.
He can do so many thing so well that I can’t put
anybody in his class.” . -

Staubach’s coach, Wayne Hardin, is not making
friends by his coaching tactics this year. Of course, this
isn’t the objective of coaching,'but Hardin seems intent
in running up as big scores as possible against his op-
ponents. '
Hardin did not endear himself to the nation’s sports-
writers when he said, “If Roger doesn’t win the Heisman

p John Bailey capped the end of an unsuccessful season
for the cross country squad by taking 104th place at the IC4A

  Gridders ’ Statistics Indicate
Greatest Squad Since] 933’  

Saturday’s win over Army gave the Panther gridders its seventh victory of the season
for the ﬁrst time since ‘1956. That team and the team of the previous year were the ﬁrst
squads since 1938 to win seven games. _ .

The 1955 team compiled a 7-4 record, including a 7-
Sugar Bowl. The 1956 aggregation won 7, lost 3 and tied one, including a 21-14 defeat
when they met the Engineers in the Gator Bowl. A Panther t

running. He is 204 yards short
of the school record set by War-
ren Heller in 1931. According to
Coach John Michelosen, Mazurek
will not be particularly concerned
with breaking the mark. “We’re
more concerned with winning
games. If we win our next two,
the record should take_ care of
itself,” Michelosen explained.
Rushing Shows Balance
The individual rushing statis-
tics show balance in the Pather
attack. ‘Only twelve -yards sep-
arate Rick Leeson (368), Mazurek
(353), and Paul Martha, (356);
Eric Crabtree, .Bill Bodle, and
John‘ Telesky have all gained
over 130 yards. “This balance in

rushing is the best since I’ve been’ .

here,” said Michelosen. “Only
Fred Cox, Bob Clemens, and Jim
Cunningham in l959‘were close
to them.” .
The team totals also have
‘been excellent. Through eight
games the Panther offense has
piled “up 193 points. This total
has already passed every year
since 1938 when they scored
213. The years between 1932
and 1937, witha high of 224,
are not out of reach. Offense,
however, is not the only im-
pressive spot. .
'1‘he defense has allowed 89
points thus far, which is the best
performance since 1940 with the
exception of the 1960 squad which
allowed only 77.
Calls Rush Better

* I

Michelosen, attributes the ’im- 3

provement on defense to a better
rush. ‘We’re not giving the op-
position any time to set their
plays,” he explained. Last year,
the Panthers allowed an average

of 137 yards per game rushing.
This year it has been cut to 96.

Pass defense also has been a
key factor in the Panthers’ rise.
Last year, the deep defenders al-
lowed 148 yards per game through
the air lanes. Enemy bombers
completed a dozen for touch-
downs. The backs this year have
permited only 97 per game and
g “If you give up 90
less yards a game, you usually
win more,” said Michelosen.

Conditioning for
Swimming Team

Stressed by Coach

Panther varsity swimmers mov-
ed into their ninth week of practice
this week with workouts becom-
ing more intense. The swimmers,
after building up their endurance
by repetitious 100 and 200 meter
sprints, have, started sprinting for
shorter‘ distances in the deep end
of Trees Hall pool.

In- another eﬁort to get the
swimmers more accustomed to
swimming under meet conditions,
dacing platforms have been in-
stalled for the swimmers to dive
into the pool as they would at the
start of a race.

For the main part of the prac-
tice, assistant coach VVill Weisz
paces along the side of the pool
checking the swimmers’ progress
_against the stopwatch. Although
the boys haven’t been timed for
regular meet distances, their
time over a long distance was
checked in a lengthy workout
last Friday.

These times indicated that the
