Referendum To Determine Allocations Control

by LINDA SAVAGE

In three weeks the Student Gov-
ernment (SG> will hold a referen-
dum to determine whether stu-
dents want to continue paying the
$12 a term student activities fee
that has come into question in the
last year.

According to Lynn Zimmerman
of the SG Judicial Board, the is-
sue is much deeper. She explain-
ed that students are actually vot-
ing on “whether SG controls the
fee and whether it is a separate
account to be controlled by "stu-
dents.”

Zimmerman stated, “As it is
now the students have control

ﬁt-ver the money and where it

goes.” If it were voted down, she
added, the administration would
control the allocation of money
to organizations. \ -

Therefore there would not be an
activities fee designated on the in-
voice as such, but there are indi-
cations that it would be compen-
sated for by a raise in tuition next
fall.

Zimmerman pointed out the is-
sue was “brought into question
because different groups had
questioned the validity and the

Pitt Debates

by BETH BELL
The once threatening subject of

. legalizing marijuana was debated

Tuesday afternoon in the Student
Union by members of the William
Pitt Debate Union and Oxford
University.

Pro members of the debate
were University students Albert
Wynn and Jack Kennedy. Mem-
bers of the opposition were Bri-
tishers Peter Haywood and Julian
Priestley.

Wynn opened the debate with
the first pro argument, which
centered on exploding the myths
concerning the usage of mari-
juana, explaining that the hallu-
cinogen was ' neither medically

N harmful, nor leads to the hard
’‘\\drugs.

A :1¥“The government has associated
- connotations to marijuana smok-

ers that are opposed to the Amer-
ican work ethic. They consider
them part of a non conformist
life style, and are linked to radi-
calism .  the left wing,” stated
Wynn.

Wynn admitted that users do re-
, eﬂfve a “high” sensation, but feels
i that it does not constitute a threat
,to the welfare of the public. By
iequating marijuana with alco-
hol and tobacco, Wynn insisted
that the government has not in-
terced in modern times with ei-
ther, yet they are both considered
great dangers to the public wel-
fare.

Oxford's first negative argu-
ment, presented by Priestley, dis-
regarded previous remarks by
discussing the right of the gov-

ernment to interced on behalf of’

the people. Priestley cited the
‘thaladamide incident of the l960’s
as an example of insufficient re-
search on the drug leading to hun-

'*--dreds of, maimed infants born in

relevance of an activities fee.”
The 1972-73 budget prepared by
the Allocations Committee. indi-
cates that the funds are being dis-
tributed to 70 organizations. This
includes such organizations as
Studio Theatre, Franklin Pang-
born Film Club, WPGH Radio,
Women’s Housing Board, Men's
Dorm Council, the eight publica-
tions, and Heinz Chapel Choir.

, If the activities fee is voted
down, Zimmerman explained, the
administration will determine
which of these organizations re-
ceive funds and how much they
receive. Many of the activities
that don’t receive funds will be
forced to discontinue, Zimmer-
man added.

Several of the organizations that
are being funded by the SG Allo-

cations Committee are urging stu- '

dents to vote yes on the referen-
dum.

The Studio Theatre added at the
bottom of their program last Sun-
day, “The Studio Theatre, an inde-
pendent student organization is
partly funded by the SG Alloca-
tions Committee. These funds
come from your student, activity
fee, which is under consideration

countries were the governments
sanctioned thaladamide.

The English debater consider-
ed the research being done at Ox-,
ford during the past 15 years that
claims to show long term serious
genetic defects inflicted on off-

spring of marijuana users. “Here _

is the time to pause . . . to be ab-
solutely sure that it won’_t be like
the thaladamide incident,” stat-
ed Priestley.

Priestley also argued that mari- .

juana is psychologically additive,
and “breaks the threshold in a

person’s behavior.” The British
debate team did not advocate the
present criminal punishment for
convicted marijuana users, and
stated that it “couldn’t be effec-

for discontinuance. Your theatre
is in danger of being discontinued
as a result.”

Also at the Saturday evening
movie an announcement was
made that the cost of movies
would go up if‘ the fee is voted
down.

Pepper Bulick, programing as-
sistant in the Student Affairs of-
fice, stated, “Students-don’t real-
ize if they vote down the student

activities fee, every bit of student -

power will be lost.”

She added that students don’t
realize the cost of entertainment.

For example, she said, a concert -

that could be seen for $3 at Pitt,-
might cost $5 or more some other
place.

In some research done on the
issue, the Judicial Board discov-
ered that nationally 14 universi-
ties that voted down an activities
fee in the past.,reinstated it with-
in three years. The administra-
tions discovered they couldn’t
handle the extra work as effi-
ciently as the students.

Sahl’s Comments Provoke Thought

The vote was originally sched-

uled for January, but the Judicial 4
Board decided to hold it on Nov. ’

14 and 15. One of the reasons was

they wanted to have it before the 

SG elections. Zimmerman ex-
plained that if the referendum is

voted down there will have to be_a ,
reassessment of the SG offices-

‘For instance without the funds
there would be no need for an.Al-

locations Committee. There was I

also consideration given to ‘how
weather conditions would affect
the turnout. '

Humor Hides Hopes of Better Future

by KAREN BURGIO

A very tired, but none the less
funny Mort Sahl spoke in the SU
Ballroom Wednesday, noon, to an
estimated crowd of 800 students.
And though his on stage manner-
ism was one of a famous and in-
tellectual comedian, off stage,

Sahl would have nothing to do with
the University or its people.

 

MORT SAHL: “This country is 196
years old and beginning to show its
age . . ." '

Photo by Jaecks

After his arrival at the Greater
Pittsburgh Airport, Sahl. made
obvious his displeasure at riding
to Pitt in a taxi—standard pro-
cedure for speakers at the Univer-
sity to avoid law suits that may
occur with passengers riding in
privately owned cars. He then told
this reporter -that there would be
no interviews, that he was “here
to do a show and that’s it.”

Civil Liberties “Fulltime Commitment”f

Law Collective Formed

by JOHN A. CAPITMAN

“We’re not all of any particu-
lar political ilk, except that we all
understand that there is a great
need for change in this country
and in the legal system as a mi-

crocosm of it,” said Paul Boas, a 4

member of the Law Collective.

Boas, a graduate of Pitt and Pitt
Law School, is one of nine law-
yers, four law students, an ex-
jailhouse lawyer, and six legal
workers, forming “a very differ-
ent kind of law firm, whose offices
are situated in a building which
they “refurbished and furnished”
themselves near to the Criminal
Court Building downtown.

The collective was formed to
fill the gaps left by other existing
legal organizations and- services,

 

making civil liberties and related
cases and causes their “fulltime
commitment.”

Tom _Gordon, a graduate of Du-
quesne and a “disillusioned”
teacher, explained thatlthe “of-
fice exists for the sake of its po-
litically important cases and by
virtue of the money received from
cases that are just like those that
any law firm handles.” -

Baos remarked that “If you’re‘
going to approach the law the way
we do, you have to run your office
differently. Salaries, for example,
aren’t based on position or ex-

perience, but on need, with the im-

plied assumption that stated

needs will be reasonable.”
Rick Isaacson explained the col-
(Coiztinued on Page 2)

he's genuinely interested in the
country, Sahl definitely knows the
inside story. He also did some re-
porting for NBC at the Democrat-
ic Convention because he didn’t
like the way it was being done.
“The reporters there didn’t know
what was going on,” he said.

In his speech, he made obvious
digs at our society—women’s lib,
homosexuals, Nixon and the Har-
risburg trials. But underneath
the humor was a thinking, dis-
satisfied man and a very serious
hope for a better future.

“This country, Sahl remarked,”
is 196 years, old and beginning to
show its age. When we began,
with four million people we had
leaders like Washington,.Jeffer-
son, and the Adamses. Now we
have 208 million and we have a
choice of leadership—Nixon or
McGovern.”

He also called President Nixon
a violent example of a Quaker-
“he. drops 31 million tons of
bombs a day in Vietnam.”

“When Nixon ran for President
in 1968, he said he had a secret

Norman Mailer, Social '

plan to end the war. He sure“ can
keep a secret. But he did get two

guys out—Jimmy Hoffa and Bob-

by Baker.”

He alluded to McGovern’s state-
ment that crime has increased 47
per cent during the Nixon admin-
istration and added, “and that’s
in the White House.”

“If you like a candidate, it’s be-

cause he reminds you of when '

you were innocent”—lines like

that mean something, as much of '

his‘ 50 minute talk did.

“I’m not worried about Viet-
nam, I'm worried about Ameri-
ca.” After his talk Sahl spoke to
a few members of the Public Af-
fairs Committee and the‘Men’s
Council, cosponsors of the event
and said, “The Berliners .say that
the situation-is serious, but not
hopeless; the South Vietnamese_
say it’s hopeless, but not serious.

I think our society is like the lat- .

ter.”
He said the peace movement
died after the Kent State killings

Critic Due to Lecture.

by KATHIE SULLIVAN

One of the most prodigious per-
sonalities of modern times is

coming to Pitt Tuesday, Oct. 31: »

Norman Mailer. Considered a
writer, a politician, a critic, a
producer, and, inevitably, a news-
maker, he is famous for his many
books, including The Naked and
the Dead, Why Are We in Viet-
nam? The Presidential Papers,
and the two most recent, Of Fire
on the Moon, a story of the Apollo
II Mission, and St. George and
the Godfather, based on the con-
ventions of each political party.

Mailer, a native of New Jersey,
is a graduate of Harvard Univer-
sity, with a degree in aeronautical
engineering. Upon the end of
World War II, he began writing
as well as editing several films.

- He has been prominent in anti-

war demonstrations since the ear-
ly 1960’s, playing a significant
role in demonstrations held at the
Pentagon in October, 1967.

In 1969, Mailer offered himself
as a reform candidate for mayor
of New York City, formulating. a

number of plans for city re-or-_

 

 

ganization and de-centralization.

Mailer also takes a controversial

stand on Women’s Liberation,
which last month caused him to

be a target for a fiery debate with 
liberation leader Germaine Greer. " "'

Mailer is on his final tour of col-

leges and universities this month  3

and is contributing much of his
energy to commentaries on po-

litics and the contemporary so- 

cial scenes. While at Pitt, he will
speak on the “Politics of Art and

the Politics of Politics.” A ques- 

tion and answer period will fol-
low the lecture, to be.held at 8:30
pm. in 120 DL, enabling Mailer to
respond more personally with
each student. Norman Mailer is
being sponsored by the Student
Government Activities Commit-
tee and the event is free of charge
upon presentation of student ID
cards.

tively stamped out on the cam-

‘ puses.”

“Just because society relies on

‘ tobacco and alcohol doesn't mean
‘it has to rely on marijuana,” con-

cluded Priestly.
Rebuttals made by Kennedy,

‘ v. followed by Haywood, discussed
7 much of what had been pointed out

during the first two arguments.

. , Kennedy stated that the govern-
‘ ment does not have the right to

restrict the morality of its socie-
ty, and quoted the Pittsburgh
Press as stating that marijuana
cigarettes contain 40 per cent

A less tar than regular cigarettes,

and therefore cause minimal

 lung "damage.

He also stated that under the

_ - “American Protestant Ethic, we
. can’t relax with pot, but should
 getulcers.”

Haywood said in a rebutal that

 we should “not just jump on any
" bandwagon. Smoking marijuana

is not as bad as murder, but it’s
not good either. The same num-

bar will smoke it if it is legal, as

are smoking it now.”

The debate was concluded by a
house vote in which the British
team won by a slight margin of
two votes.

Law Collective Organized

lective differently, “We’re trying
to deal with people on a non-elit-
ist level, and not only are we an
office with some of its members
having special training, we’re a
group of people trying to get out-
selves together by breaking down
the stereotyped roles and working
in a honestly cooperative way.”

Isaacson, a graduate of Dick-
inson School of Law, continued,
"Everybody in this office is just
as important as everybody else:
all decisions are made collective-
ly—its simply just a great place
to work.”

This enthusiasm is shared
equally by legal workers. such as
Mary Levine, a graduate of Rich-
mond College of the University of
New York, who said, “The obvi-
ous conclusion is that everybody
here enjoys what they’re doing-
you really have to have a com-
mitment to extending your serv-
ices to the community at a nomin-
al cost.”

To Michael Rosenfield, who got
his BA. from Penn State and his
law degree from Dickinson, the
important thing about the collec-

tive is that “here we can keep
the confidence of our clients, do-

.ing the work we were trained

for and still maintain some per-
sonal integrity.”

In Rosenfield’s eyes, however.
the work, cases, and people in-
volved are more important than
the life style of the collective, an
attitude apparently shared by
most of the Collective’s members.
They work on cases ranging from
civil rights and prison reform to
antropologists Nan Pendrell’s suit
against Chatham College.

The Collective is involved in the
case of O’Ma1ley v. Brierly,
where two Catholic priests, who
were giving religious counseling
to the inmates of Western Peni-
tentiary were “banned from the
prison, because of participation
in a peaceful and lawful demon-
stration held shortly after Attica.”

Rosenfield explained that the
issue in the case is “whether in-
mates are human beings or ani-
mals: if they are human beings
then they must not be treated ar-
bitrarily and denied their freedom
of religion but treated fairly as
guaranteed by the constitution.”

Another case is that of Cynthia

Jo Samuels v. the University of
Pittsburgh, in which a Pennsyl-
vania resident was denied the
right to “in-state tuition” fees
because she married an out of
state man.

“Prior to the bringing of this
suit, the residency of a woman for
the purposes of tuition was de-

'termined by the domicile of her

husband,” stated Isaacson, “but
now the law says that it is prima
facie. her own residence, so the
problem becomes to determine
how a woman may establish resi-
dency, and to find out what wom-
en are owed money because of
the old law.”

“A case like this one, and work-
ing in this office,”
Isaacson, “makes you realize
something about law schools:
they only teach you the laws of
this country and how to use them
so you can make money for you-
self and the people rich enough
to afford a lawyer.”

“And the second thing you real-
ize is that the law is administered
by people, and when you get into
court all sorts of extraneous
things, like whether somebody

got out of bed on the wrong side; -.
all sorts of very human things“ , '

which have nothing to do with the
law, become important.”

Deborah Logan, who spent some
time at Meadville State College,
although presently at Pitt, gave a
feeling for the law office as both

this k_ind of “very human, unregi— , .

merited environment . .  that is

“not trying to change or remake "

society in one blow, but to make a
dent in it.”

“Working here you suddenly
really understand that there are
poor people in big cities—because
here you begin to really deal with

‘other people and their problems,
legal and otherwise—you’re do-

ing worthwhile work.”

Senate Bill 1210

Shafts  

Med Students

by VIRGINIA COOK

Pennsylvania’s health care crisis will not be solved by Senate
Bill 1210. The bill, which passed the Senate by a 45-to-O vote, requires
students of medical colleges subsidized by the state to repay their
portion of the state’s subsidy—which at Pitt is approximately $5,-
.‘000 per student per year.

The bill stipulates several ways

in which graduates can re-

pay the “loans.” If the graduate practices medicine in Pennsyl-
vania, especially in “physician shortage areas,” the loans will
be forgiven.”If he or she doesn’t, he or she will be required to pay

a prohibitive debt over a 20-year period.

 \ and local officials must cooperate, too. .

|l|llV_Al1lIV



The legislature, of course, believes this will mean more doctors
for Pennsylvania, since it supports seven medical schools in the state.
Even if it did provide more doctors, that does not mean better
health care, and that is really the issue in Pennsylvania.

The issue is health care ‘delivery. The legislature says this is due
to a doctor shortage—yet the bill is filled with verbage, and presents
‘no quantification of the number of doctors who really do leave Penn-
sylvania. Physician shortage areas may exist (which is not‘thé' same
thing as saying there are not enough doctors)—but there are also
hospital shortage areas, nurse shortage areas, inygeneral, medical-
support team shortage areas. A few more doctors cannot compensate
for these failings.

What is needed, especially for our rural areas, is some coherent
health care plan. We recognize that the legislature has solicited
suggestions from deans of Pennsylvania medical schools, and that its
queries, in general, have fallen on deaf cars.

A notable exception is Donald Medearis, Dean of Pitt’s Medical
School. A‘

Dr. Medearis has gone before the legislature to present concrete

proposals about what can and should be done for the people of Penn-
, sylvania— which included an innovative proposal to strategically sta-
" ., tion helicopters throughout the state to provide fast emergency health
i care for citizens.

; We need more ideas like this—and we need some pilot projects
, . to see if they really canfill the needs of this state.

But Dean Medearis’ voice cannot be the only voice before the
legislature. It is up to the leaders of the medical profession in the
state, especially, the Deans of the six other medical schools to pre-

' sent significant proposals. ,

The medical profession in rural areas must be willing to accept

young doctors into the profession and the community. They must

,_. ~ «establish more precepterships—opportunities for students to work
 with doctors before graduation——something which is starting in In-
S diana County. . -

The state must provide support facilities and medical support
- personnel if we are to have an effective health care network. And

S‘ finally, local politicians must not interfere orhinder progressive pilot
programs——-as is reportedly the case with emergency care in Allegheny
County. '

Senate Bill 1210 is not a solution. But even if it were, it would
be four years before we would get results—and we can't afford four
more years of inadequate health care. The bill's restriction on phy-

 ,- -sicians might cause other states _to throw up the same restrictions,
complicating the health care problem.-‘

A profession that depends so much on specialists cannot afford

restrictions that prohibit movement to specialized academic hospitals.

For example, many out-of-state physicians come to Children’s Hos-

pital to specialize and Pennsylvania physicians go to other states.

Pennsylvania’s crisis in health care is a problem of deploying
medical resources effectively. If anything, Senate Bill 1210 deters
that. , .
But the legislature has, tried. Now it is the responsibility of the
profession to make health care delivery one of its top priorities. The
profession must make proposals, the legislature must act on them

A , With a comprehensive health care system, Pennsylvania would
}r’' ‘' attract all. the medical personnel it needed, making desperate legis-
' lative acts unnecessary, and ‘providing the citizens of Pennsylvania

the health care they deserve.

Legalized Casinos Needed

by RALPH DEAN

Last week, being in» an unusually quixotic
mood, I wrote a letter to our wonderful Gover-
nor Shapp suggesting that he propose a bill to
establish a chain of Las Vegal-style casinos, to
be owned and operated by the Commonwealthﬁl
pointed out that, these would meet what seems to
be the only requirement for a new Common-
wealth program-—that it either make money or spend
it lavishly. Should I receive a reply from Gover-
nor Shapp, (a minute possibility) it will no doubt
state that such a program is impossible because
of the great expression of public disapproval
that would result. ' A

This is absurd. Who is there to protest? Cer-
tainly not the usual crowd of “little old ladies.”
They have no basis for moral objection, because
they are among the ones who can be seen return-
ing from the supermarket. every week clutching
a fistful of 50 cent Pa. lottery tickets and who
will become addicted to -the forthcoming weekly
“Lucky Seven” lottery.

The lotteries can be criticized on all the same
grounds a casino can. Both lessen the importance
of individual talent, intelligence, and initiative.
How is someone who has worked hard for all he
has to feel when some derelict wins $50,000 be-
cause he happened to plunk down four bits for a

ticket the last time he was in a bar somewhere?
Putting this and the Protestant Ethicvaside, one
must agree on practical grounds that no society
can long survive without having as one of its key-
stones the belief that a man should receive in pro-
portion to his contributions.

The lotteries are also unfair because they re--
semble a flat-rate tax in that they give everyone

‘the same (small) chance of return.

And about that chance. No one can fault the
Commonwealth for taking some of the lottery
funds and reducing the property taxes of the elder-
ly. (Casino funds could be used similarly) How-
ever, the amount of money used for this is dis-
appointingly small when one considers the lottery
funds being used to finance exorbitant spending
in other Commonwealth departments, and those
lost to the bureaucracy which is running the lot-
tery. This all adds up to long odds against the lot-
tery player. By comparison, the house odds against
the Casino-goer can be reduced to less than two
percent at Blackjack and to nearly even at Reno.

My final argument for Pa.—operated Casinos is
that they would be enjoyable, a great place to take
a date or to use to avoid one’s problems for a
while. As long as we’re throwing ethics out the
window and supporting bad government we might
as well have fun at it.’

Letters to the Editor

Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to thank you for the
article which you ran, nominating
me for “Homecoming Queen” in
your issue of Oct. 9. I regret, how-
ever, that I must at this time de-
cline the nomination and with-
draw my name from the contest.
I feel that some explanation is due
to you.

It would be difficult to argue
with the spirit in which the nom-
ination was made, but there are
some other factors which must be
considered. First, like yourself, I
feel that the tradition of having a

Homecoming Queen is no longer
‘a proud tradition. I was very

pleased last year when Ron Hart-
man’s Homecoming Committee
opted for the “Pitt Woman” as op-
posed to the Queen, and would
have liked to have seen this prac-
tice continued. It is unfortunate
that this year’s committee was not
of like mind. Since I have moral
objections _to the idea of a
“Queen,” I feel that my candi-
dacy lends a certain validity

which contradicts my personal"

feelings.
Second, the endorsement was

made, on your behalf because of"

contributions I had made to the
University. I feel, that should I
win, the effect which my winning
would have could possibly be
detrimental to the University and
that a sensitivity to this factor
should be considered. Although
most students and other members
of the University community
would probably understand, there
are influential elements who
would not. Although these ele-
ments would be completely intol-
erant to our feelings, I don’t
think that we should fall victim
to the same intolerance.

Many critics of this nation’s stu-
dents find us irresponsible and
ready to desecrate any tradition
or symbol of the status quo mere-
ly for the sake of doing it. I doubt
seriously if they would believe
that in this case it just is not
true.

There are good traditions and
bad traditions, and I think this
year’s Homecoming theme “Back
to Tradition” suggests. that all
traditions are good. Slavery was
once a tradition in this country
and, we are all aware that, tradi-
tionally a woman‘s place was in
the home. Such is the case of the
“Homecoming Queen.” True, it is
a tradition, but it is one that we
could very well do without. I
find it impossible to lend my sup-
port to this tradition even joking-
ly.

Again, I thank you for your con-
sideration and hope that you can
appreciate my feelings.

Very truly yours,
Bob Ging

Editor, The Pitt News:
In response to the most recent

political debate on health care in .

the United States, I want to quote
a passage from Ayn Rand’s novel
Atlas Shrugged, in Which Dr. Hen-
dricks explains why he quit the
medical profession:

“I observed that in all the dis-
cussions that preceded the en-
slavement of medicine, men dis-
cussed everything—except the
desires of the doctors. Men con-
sidered only the ‘welfare’ of the
patients, with no thought for those
who were to provide it. That a doc-
tor should have any right, desire
or choice in the matter, was re-
garded as irrelevant, selfishness;
his is not to choose, they said,
only ‘to serve.’ That a man who’s
willing to work under compulsion
is too dangerous a brute to entrust
with a job in the stockyards—nev-
er occurred to those who proposed
to help the sick by making life im-
possible for the healthy. I have of-
ten wondered at the smugness
with which people assert their
right to enslave me, to control my
work, to force my will, to violate
my conscience, to stifle my mind
—yet what is it that they expect to
depend on, when they lie on an op-
erating table under my hands?

“Let them discover the kind of
doctors that the system will now
produce. Let them discover, in
their operating rooms and hospi-
tal wards, that it is not safe to
place their lives in the hands of a
man whose life they have throt-
tled. It is not safe, if he is the sort
of man who resents it—and still
less safe, if he is the sort who
doesn’t.”

Editor, The Pitt News:

When Lenny Klavonic left Stu-
dent Government, it appears that
the entire social life at the Univer-
sity departed with him. Not only
has this year’s Student Govern-

, ment failed to live up to program-

ming standards set last year, but
they have failed to even attempt to
live up to many of their campaign
promises. Remember the free
movies they talked about? Not
only are the Saturday night mo-
vies, which our activities fees are

supposed to support, still 50¢, but
they’ve increased the price of the
Friday night flicks as well. All
for the $24 a year we pay.

Last year, Klavonic brought in
Blood, Sweat, and Tears, John
Mayall and Crazy Horse, Ike and
Tina Turner, Delaney and Bonney,
Billy Preston, Logins and Mes-
sina, the Fifth Dimension, not to
mention free concerts with Atom-
ic Rooster and Bill Withers. This
year there’s only been one con-
cert, a futile attempt by Student
Government to put on a rock op-
era which after only selling 38
tickets, they had to give away the
rest, over 3,800, and even then
less than-a 1,000 kids showed up.
Homecoming looks like a dis-

aster. Edgar Winters who is no

longer with his band White Trash
and Malo, both of whom have just
recently appeared here, Edgar
Winters just last month, don’t
measure up to a Homecoming con-
cert, let alone any kind of concert
with the money available from our
activities fees. And what more is
lined up for us? Judging from the
incompetence of the agents, com-
mittee members and the board,
probably’ a rerun of this falls
Howdy Doody Show.

Last year’s Student Government
ment,put on a dance every week-
end with some outa site bands
from all over. This year’s Board
has managed to work up one dance
in the dorms which the Dorm
Councils put on and a commuter
dance. '

Wonder why its been so quiet
around here this year. Go up to
Student Government and check
out the way they spend our activ-
ities fees, remodeling their of-
fices, all four of them, complete
with a brand new conference table
in room 300. So where do they
meet to blow our money. Read any
meeting announcement in 'theSU
and its says room 524. Not only
have they taken some beautiful

ﬂ.

trips, but they kicked out the’,‘

service committees of SG and
completely remodeled room 306
for them, putting in paneling, a
false wall and standard wall-to-
wall carpeting. No other organiza-
tion on campus lives in such reg-
alness.

Lenny Klavonic, Dennis Concil-
la, and Wade Lawson were contro-
versial _at Pitt last year for what

they did for students. This year’s _ .

Student Government is not. There
can be nothing in the way of con-
troversy where there is nothing to

' begin with except a Board silently

spending money on themselves.

‘Seagull’ Production Pure Guano,

by KEITH SHUSTER

Anton Chekhov’s The Seagull
can be a director’s nightmare, but
if he is able to master the play
without breaking its spirit, he can
succeed in bringing a potential
masterpiece to life. The Seagull is
often termed impressionistic; it
presents realism, but only in tiny
splashes of detail that must be co-
ordinated to make the entire play
comprehensible.

Thus, the director must have a
deft, but delicate touch. To arbi-
trarily attempt to force the play
into some thematic, ideological,
or stylistic straightjacket limits
the audience’s vision to that small
piece of the work that suggests its
use, while to permit all the ele-
ments to run wild produces a
meaningless chaos.

Unfortunately, Point Park’s pro-
duction of The Seagull at the Play-
house’s Theatre Upstairs labors
under both of these directoral er-
rors./Alan Clarey, a member of
the Playhouse Resident Equity
Company and of the faculty of
Theater Arts at Point Park Col-
lege demonstrated , V little under-
standing of Chekhov’s melan-
choly comedy. Not only did he fail
to give consistent direction to all
aspects of the ‘production from
casting to setting,- he also was un-
able to pace the play so that the
balance and interplay between
the comic and tragic elements
were destroyed. ‘

It is this ironic equilibrium
that acts as catalyst to the drama-
tic growth in .Seagull. Gently

mocked self-pity is the first view ~

of problems that will end in sui-
cide and madness. A game of lot-
to plays counterpoint to the death
of a young man and the unhappi-
ness of the players.

Under Clarey’s direction, all of
this interaction loses its signifi-
cance. The blocking was mislead-
ing, with people rushing from one
end of stage to another, making
turns, and gesturing wildly, all
for no apparent reason-to the audi-
ence, and I suspect, the actors.

To cope with the long mono-
logues and lack of physical ac-
tion, Clarey speeded up the
speeches rather than creating
small splotches of growing inten-
sity with the emotional action of
self-revelatiion. ‘ A

He added melodramatic but in-
appropriate touches like candles
in a dark room at a clearly an-
nounced 1 p.m. stage time. From
this disorder, Clarey manages to
garner just a few Weak laughs,
and only in Act Four where the
tragedy of self-inflicted death
took the play out of his hands, was
there any sense of sorrow.

Theater is the art form most
dependent on the exchange be-
tween artists and viewers. The
fuzzy, inconsistent stimuli gener-
ating from the Playhouse stage
blocked the audience’s response.
The result was boredom and alien-
ation, not communication.

Confusion was the sole constant

throughout this production. Cast-
ing was inept. For example, Dr.

Dorn is supposed to be a greying, 4

but still attractive man, one of
the more empathetic characters
in the cast. He was played by
Gregory M. Bonifate, who unfor-
tunately resembled and was cos-
tumed like Charlie Chaplin.

Madame Arkadina, a famous
romantic actress, was portrayed
by Peggy Domer. However, Ms.

Domer’s grating voice could nev--
er have won her any roles except,

queen bitch.

Barbara Rucker was to be the
mother of Marlene Sonis, Polina
and Masha, respectively. Either
they had something better than
Ivory Soap or the makeup was
poorly done, for Polina looked far

younger than Masha despite Po-

lina"s unhappy marriage and an
affair with the doctor. (I forgot to
check for dishpan hands.)

Or perhaps it’s simply the Rus-
sian climate, since none of the
older characters looked or mov-
ed according to their age, with
the exception of Shamrayev, por-
trayd by John Scott Mottinger.
Two of the major characters, Jen-
nifer Wells as Nina, and Larry
Dyekman as Konstantin were dif-

J ficult to grasp because of the di-

rection.
The only impression from both
was physical. Jennifer rarely

moved more than her arms ex-
cept when she was supposed to be
“dramatic,” in which case she
was melodramatic. Larry was too
slimy, too much of a snot—nosed
brat to allow us -to share his frus-
trations and loneliness.

On top of all these basic diffi-
culties, director Clarey decided
to reduce the actors to carica-

tures. So Arkadina is a stingy,
selfish bitch, Trigorin the weak
but clever writer, Nina the in-
genue who learns through bitter
experience,’Konstantin the moth-
er-fixated, pubertal son, and Dron
the comic relief. Such limita-
tions are justifiable only for a
melodrama, and they numbed
whatever rebellious talent may
have been left in Clarey’s student
actors.

The setting by Mary Ellen Ken-
nedy was ambiguous for a play at-
tempting some kind of realism.
There was no separation between
veranda and house except steps,
so that at one point an actor walk-
ed through the wall to carry a
dining room chair onto the veran-
da. The audience, which was seat-
ed on three sides, was so remov-
ed from half the stage on two of
the sides that they miss any spark
of life that may emanate from
the cast.

What remained after Alan Clar-
ey’s alternately incomprehensi-
ble and melodramatic direction
was the haunting music planned
by Margaret Hemple and Bonnie
Davies, and some moving mo-
ments in Marlene Sonis’ Masha,
who alone seemed comfortable
with Chekhov’s ironic joke on
life’s sorrows.

Otherwise, incoherence per-
vaded this production of The Sea-
gull on every level from the most
obvious to the subconscious. It is
never wrong to try a new way of

doing theater, as each production '

must in some way be original.
But to betray your actors, tech-
nicians, and audience with direc-
torial power and the promise of
creation when you have no idea
how to approach a play is more
than failure, it is an artistic sin.

Heinz Chapel Chair to
Perform ‘Fairy Queen’

by ANDREW J. SOPKO _
Arts Editor

_ English opera comes to Pitts-
burgh this weekend and we are
justly proud to report that our
own university is responsible for
its advent. At 3 p.m. this Sunday
next at Carnegie Music Hall, the

‘Heinz Chapel Concert Choir, Pitt

Orchestra, Pitt Dance Ensemble,
and vocal soloists will present
one of the rarae aves of the entire
repertoire, Henry Purcell’s “The
Fairy Queen.”

Based upon Shakespeare’s “A
Midsummer Night’s Dream,” the
intent of the “Fairy Queen” is to
delight not only the mind but the
ear and the eye as well. To fulfill
this purpose, Dr. Don Franklin,
conductor and “general producer”
of the overall attempt has assem-
bled a cast of formidable propor-
tions.

In addition to the choral and or-
chestral, forces, a quintet of solo-
ists will highlight the perfor-
mance: Mary Ann Doody, instruc-

tor in voice at the University (and

our Athalia), and Lynn Beck-
strom, a local Met audition win-
ner, will fulfill the two soprano
roles. That most rare of voices,
that of the countertenor, is rep-
resented by James Schwahacher,
a ’vocalist who made his debut
with the San Francisco Opera.
Tenor Martin Doner, a West Vir-

ginia University graduate, and
bass Warren Fremling, another
local Met winner, complete the
list of solo.

As» “English Opera,” the Pur-
cell work demands not only a
sung libretto but a spoken se-
quence as well. Explaining the
course of events through the spok-
en word will be Tom Spinella, who
also played the part of Puck in
last year’s Midsummer Night’s
Dream production.

Enhancing the theatrical and, I
“masquelike” ‘nature of the entire I

work will be the appearance of
the Pitt Dance Ensemble under
the direction of Jeanne Beaman.

What is most enticing about the
production is the fact that it will
not be a bland “concert version”
as is the usual case in the revival
of such works. Quite frankly",
“Fairy Queen” has been fully

staged only once in recent times, .

at Covent Garden in 1947, V and

while our upcoming Pittsburgh __ 

production will not be a fully

staged, one it will certainly to a '

close attempt to it. ~

Those who are not familiar with
the form of this work or its mu-
sic should not be detered from
attending on Sunday. While “Fairy
Queen” is admittedly unknown in
our area, rehearsals‘. over the
weeks have proven that it should
become better known.

1 Cubs Battling Kent State  

by RON SIEGEL

The first winning junior varsity season in four years is on the line
today as the Cubs battle the Golden Flashes of Kent State in the Flashes’

stadium.

The team is basically consisting of the same players that defeated
Maryland last week. Once again, the Cub coaches will be Steve Petro
and his assistants, Dan Lynn and Ed Sadowski.

“We’re going up to win, not just to play,” declares an enthusias-

sive against Grove City, but Haines is only a junior
and will be back next year. Haines has posted two

shutouts so far this year and still has a chance at
the Pitt record of six blanks in one campaign.

The booters, who presently post a 3-3-1 slate,
. should use the game at Edinboro to help them back
on their way to at least equaling their 1971 record.
Last year Pitt finished with a 7-3-2 card.

The game is also an important one in terms of
the West Penn Conference. Pitt is the defending
champion but this year is receiving a strong chal-
lenge from Alliance College. This year, however,
Alliance will be playing more conference matches
than Pitt and even if the two teams wind up unde-
feated in West Penn play, there may be some diffi-
culty in determining a champion.

Coach Leo Bemis, who served as the president
of the conference in its first two years of existence,
has noted that the champions are picked by the per-
centage standings and Pitt may have to arrange a
playoff for the crown.

After this weekend’s game, the booters will
travel to. Slippery Rock State College on Tuesday,
Oct. 31, to battle the Rockets in another league con-
test. This will be the last 0

tic Lynn, “We’ll be giving every-' .

thing we have to win this one.”

The squad had a few extra work-
outs after varsity practice this
week, but once again will be ham-
pered by a lack of practice time.
“We’d like more practice time,
but ‘there's nothing you can do
about that,” sighed Lynn. “We
can’t expect perfect execution on
every play, we'll just have to do
the best we I:-an."

This will be the last game of
the season for the junior varsity,
and from here on in, it will be can-
non fodder for the varsity. Of
course, further injuries to the
varsity could result in some play-
ers seeing action later in the year.

The quarterbacking will once
again be shared by sophomore
Rich Washinko and freshman Don
Herold. The running backs should
also be the same, however Ted
Berrien may be called upon by the
varsity, if Bruce Murphy or Claire
Wilson is unable to play tomorrow
at Syracuse. ~ .

are expected to be led at quarter-
back by freshman Ted Liszka,

receiver is split end Willie Davis
from Miami, Ohio.

Throughout the season, Kent
State kept changing their minds
about whether Pitt would be al-
lowed to use upperclassmen, _or be
restricted to just freshmen. When
convinced that because of num-I
erous injuries to the varsity, Pitt
could not field a- team of only
freshmen, Kent State finally per-
mitted Pitt to use whoever they

-wanted. '

A $1 dollar admission is being
charged for the game, and along
with West Virginia’s $2 entrance
fee, the only Pitt junior varsity
game that could have been seen
without charge was the home
game with Maryland. Game time
was2p.m.

Back Of Week 1

The Pitt Panthers’ outstanding
quarterback during the ’72 cam-
paign, senior John Hogan has been
named the ECAC (Eastern Col-
legiate Athletic Conference) Back
of the Week, for his performance
in the Boston College game.

Hogan earned the top quarter-‘

back position after the first con-
test of the year. His performance

So McGovern can’t win, eh?
Wherehave you heard that before?

In the primaries last Spring,
that’s where.

But you fooled the political
experts and rewrote the history
books. You provided the manpower
and womanpower for the largest,
smoothest, toughest vote-canvas-
sing operation this country had
ever seen.

Now it’s time to do it again.
And the job this Fall is even more
important. For the choice between
Nixon and McGovern is the clear-
est choice voters have had for a
generation. -

McGovern has opposed the
bombing of Indochina, while
Nixon has been inﬂicting the ex-
plosive equivalentof 7 Hiroshima
atom bombs a month on that al-
ready devastated area.

Nixon believes in putting.peo-
ple out of work in order to hold
down prices. His policies have put
2 million more people out of work.
McGovern believes that there
should be a job for everyone who
wants to work, with the U.S. Gov-

The Age of McGovern

Dedicated to raising $1 million
for a nationwide get-out—the-vote drive

ernment itself as the employer of
last resort.

Nixon started his campaign
with $10 million in secret money.
McGovern’s campaign is ﬁnanced
almost entirely by contributions
of $5 to $25 from the people.

Nixon has nominated conserv-
atives and mediocrities to the
United States Supreme Court.
One or two more Nixon appoint-
ments if he is re-elected, and you’ll
live with a heavy-handed Nixon
court for the rest of your life.
McGovern has pledged to appoint
a woman and members of racial
and ethnic minorities, and will ap-
point highly qualiﬁed liberals.

Ralph Nader says the Nixon

he clerest cc for geratio

Administration is “the most cor-
rupt in our history.” The late
Robert Kennedy called George

McGovern “the most decent man ,

in the Senate.”
McGovern wants the million-

aires and the large corporations to‘

start paying their fair share of
taxes. Nixon wants to maintain
the status quo. ,

Get an absentee ballot if you
need one. Get some money to-
gether to help us make get-out-
the—vote phone calls. And get to-
gether with your local McGovern
Committee to ﬁnd out how you
can help.

You started this campaign. It’s
up to you to ﬁnish it.
