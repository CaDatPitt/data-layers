Pitt to evaluate
 foreign aid

programs

Gideon Bradshaw
News Editor

Pitt professor Louis A. Picard said that
the U.S. government must promote sta-
bility in the developing world in order
to combat the violent extremist groups
thatthese nations harbor.

“You cannot use military threat
alone,” he said.

Last month, Pitt formally signed a
$2.6 million contract, which it will share
with the Mitchell Group, a research firm
based in Washington, D.C. Under the

~ contract, Pitt and the Mitchell Group

will evaluate programs that USAID, the
U.S. government’s primary international
development agency, has implemented
in parts ofWest Africa. The U.S. govern-
ment has been concerned in recent years
about the vulnerability of the historical-
ly unstable region to violent extremism.

Picard, the director of the Ford'In—
stitute for Human Security at-Pitt’s
Graduate School of Public and Interna-
tional Affairs, is the coordinator of the
Governance Group, a research center

‘in the Ford Institute that will conduct

the evaluation on the University’s side
of the contract.

Picard, who estimated that he has
worked in at least 40 countries in Africa
and the Middle East, said that USAID
chose Pitt to share the contract because
Pitt’s offer was competitive and because
of researchers like himself who have pri-

or experience in evaluating foreign aid. ~

USAID could not be reached for com-

_ ment.

USAID has tasked the joint team from
Pitt’s Governance Group and the Mitchell
Group with evaluating its Peace through
Development program in Niger, Burkina

’ Faso and Chad. The program aims to help

Universityeliminates TeleFact services

Brett Wilson
Staff Writer

After a decline in usage over the past few
years called into question the viability
of TeleFact as a formula group on cam-
pus, Pitt recently eliminated the group’s
funding. “

After a year of frequent debate at Stu— e

dent Government Board meetings over
the practicality of the student—run fact-
finding service, Pitt has announced that
it will no longer fund the service, citing a
decline in its usage. The Board aimed to
remove TeleFact from its formula group
status, which allotted it a guaranteed per-

centage of the yearly Student Activities V.
Fund. The Student Government Board and «

University also said the -proliferationfof

easier access to information has rendered ‘
the service obsolete. Despite efforts byj” '

Kayla Mormak, the TeleFact coord—ina-

.1‘

tor, the University has decided to cut the
group’s funding. Its telephone service is
now inactive. . ‘

For SGB, the announcement is the
culmination of asix-month discussion
regarding the future of the program.

At a meeting last December, SGB rec-
ommended that Pitt’s administration cut
TeleFact’s funding. SGB President Gordon
Louderback continued the push to change
the method of funding for the service,
vowing during his campaign to correlate
appropriations with the number of calls
TeleFact received on a monthly basis.

When the service was still operational,
Pitt students could call a phone number
that would connect them with one of Tele-

r_ Fa.ct’s student employees. The caller could

then ask any ‘number of questions — ex-
cept those that violated academic policy

or exams — and the representative would
provide an answer.

Louderback said that the Board advised
Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey and
Director of Student life Kenyon Bonner
that TeleFact was no longer a necessary
service, and Pitt administrators officially
defunded the organization on April 26.

Bonner agreed with Louderback‘ and
the Board’s assessment, saying that Tele-
Fact’s use had seen a “significant and pro-
gressive” decline over the last ﬁve years.

He said that the organization served

"an important function when it was estab-

lished in 1990, but SGB and the University
believe that students can now ﬁnd infor-
mation through other outlets.

Bonner cited data TeleFact collected,

saying that calls to the service have de-

Pitt students prevail in college marketing competition
Students showcase advertising, networkingskills

Kathleen Fennell
Staﬂ" Writer

Four Pitt students will ride in style for
one month this summer thanks to their
hard work, the Ford Motor Company
and the “Intern Queen,” Lauren Berger.
Pitt students Adam Gaus, Nicolette
Bevec, Sara Klein and Arie Lombar-
dozzi were crowned winners of the
2013 College Ambassador Challenge,
beating students from more than four
other universities after competing in
three different marketing challenges
this spring. Each team member received
$500, an all-expense-paid trip to Chi-
cago to meet with Ford executives and
the opportunity to drivepa Ford vehicle

4»

for one month. 3* .

The group of Pitt students competed
against teams from the University of 11-
linois at Urbana-Champaign, University
of Louisville, University of Michigan
and University of Minnesota. These
universities were selected based on

Great Lakes Marketing’s five different
regions and their past engagements
with Berger.

David Mason, Ford’s Marketing
Development Manager, said that the
purpose of the College Ambassador
Challenge was to provide students with
real-life experiences and teach them to
market products in innovative ways.

“From Ford Motor Company’s stand-
point, we wanted to understand better
how to market to the millennials and
provide a good learning experience as
well  It’s kind of Ford giving back to
the university with real-world experi-
ences, and, of course, at the same time,

Ford was learning as well,” Mason said.

One challenge required the team to
advertise a lecture given by Berger, a

speaker known as the “Intern ’Queen.’’'i ‘

She uses the nickname because she has
held a total of 15 internships and now
draws on these experiences as she lec-
tures students on "how to land their
own positions.

This challenge required students to

use their marketing skills to persuade
students to_attend the event. I
Klein, ajunior film and business ma-
jor, said this challenge was particularly
difficult because the event was sched-
uled on the same evening as the NCAA
men’s basketball championship game.
She also said that it was raining the
night of the lecture, which washeld at
the O’Hara Student Center — a loca-
tion that students consider to be out
of the way. A

To market the event, the team went,

tocareerexpos on campus where they

‘spoke and handed ‘outflyers. On April

‘8, the day'Be‘rger'visited Pit't’s.campus,
the team set up a tent with Ford cars
in the Schenley Quad. In the end, 54

‘people showedup, all_owing'Pitt__to take

third place in the ‘challenge.

Each team also participated in the
Viral Video Challenge, in which they
created ‘a one-minute video to adver-
tise five of Ford’s vehicles.

Judges used results from
social media to judge the

success of each video, and Pitt’s team
came in first place.

Gaus, a recent Pitt graduate, said
that he was most proud of the video
submission. In addition to the speak-
ing event and "video, the teams had to
complete the Race to 120 Challenge,
convincing 120 people above the age of
25 to test-drive one of Ford’s vehicles at
a dealership. Gaus said this challenge
was tricky because the students were
forced to communicate with people
outside their own age group.

“It’s easy to ask people to vote for a
video, but it’s harder to ask people to
take an hour out of their day [to test-
drive a car] for us,” Gaus said.

Despite this difficulty, the Pitt team
took second place in this challenge.

t“Getting 120 test drives initially was
thought of as being very easy, but it
posed a different challenge for them,
so they had to think .0,utside,the box,”

TELEFACT

clined about 97 percent since the 2008-2009 academic
year, when it received about 100,000 calls annually.

“The radical leap into the digital age and the prolif-
eration of search‘ engines, social networking and mobile
applications, has virtually nulliﬁed the need for Te1efact,”
Bonner said in an email.

Louderback also said that technological advances ren-
dered the service unnecessary, pointing to the growing
availability-of smartphones and computers.

But Mormak has maintained that some students do
need the service. ‘

“Lots of students are living on loans and spending the
bare minimum,” she said. “For the students who have to
forgo the luxury of a smartphone, international students
especially, having a lifeline to the Internet can make a‘
huge difference in the quality of their experience here
at Pitt,” she said.

As an example, Mormak said that one TeleFact user,
who was blind, used to call the service every Tuesday
and Thursday for the weather. On those days, the caller’s
roommate left the house first.

Mormak also said that one time when she was a fresh-
man at Pitt, she and a friend got lost. Because she did not
own a smartphone and her friend’s was dead, they called

TeleFact in order to receive directions home.

But Louderback said that the Board did not think
the organization should still qualify as a formula group.

Formula groups, which the SGB constitution iden-
tifies as groups that “are recognized by the Office of
Student Life as serving an integral role in enhancing
the student experience at the University of Pittsburgh,”
receive a guaranteed percentage of the annual_ Student
Activities Fund. ‘ I

As a formula group, TeleFact received 3.4 percent of
the fund every.year. This totaled to more than $88,000

in the 2013 ﬁscal year, the‘ majority of which went to

paying its employees. Other formula groups include Pitt
Program Council (33.5 percent),-WPTS-FM Radio (6.1
percent), Student Volunteer Outreach (3.9 percent) and
Panther Prints (1.6 percent). ’ A i
“There are only a handful of [formula groups], and
we as a Board felt that TeleFact was no longer one of
those organizations as it was now rivaled by the avail’-
ability of the Internet on computers and smartphones,”
Louderback, who was a Board member at the time the
Board made the recommendation, said. ’ B
’ Once TeleFact lost formula-group status, it also lost
its entitlement to guaranteed money from the Student
Activities_Fund.
In February, Bonner and Mormak agreed to release
a survey that would allow both non—CGS undergraduate
and graduate students to voice their opinions on'TeleFact
and why or why not they believed it shodld still be rec-

ognized as a formula group. A total of 243 non—CGS and .

51 graduate students responded to the survey. Of those
who responded, a majority said they had never used the
service, and less than one ﬁfth said they use the service
a few times a month or daily.

After the survey, Mormak continued to do her best to
keep TeleFact at Pitt. I _

“We gave her a chance to counteract our recommenda-
tion to Bonner and‘/I-Iumphrey, and she made‘ a proposal
to make it more of an online tool so students could use it
as more of search engine,” Louderback said.

Mormak aimed make TeleFact more ‘of raiionline
community, and'ariy Pitt student could register, and use
TeleFact as aireso'u‘_rce for his or her own needs. Students
could also add content that was more relevant to the
Pitt community. ' ‘ '

Mormak did notvrespond to an emaillaskinig what
advantage the online community offered over search
engines. , V’

But Mormak’s prbposal to make theservice more of an

I online and social networking tool to helpistudents was

not enough to maintain funding for the group. Mormak
said that this deci'si'bn is harmful to both‘ undergraduate
and graduate students. , I I ‘

‘‘TeleFact wastlie only bridge between a large and

disconnected University,” she said in an email. “As I

learned from my peers, master’s and doctoral students
at Pitt do not receiye the same kind of introduction that
undergraduates a’ré‘provided.” I

communities threatened by extremism, and will be
the initial focus of the five—year project.
The Mitchell Group was unavailable for comment.
Chris Belasco, a doctoral candidate at GSPIA, will
serve as research coordinator for the Governance
Group. Belasco said‘ that Peace through Development
selects an area that would be roughly equivalent

, in size to a county or municipality in the United

States where opportunities are limited..There, US-
AID provides grants to the local government or to
non-government organizations in order to foster
community resilience. .

“It’s better for everybody for the local citizens
to determine the programs that are implemented,”
Belasco said. “It tends to be more participatory, and

it tends to be considered more of a product of the.

community.” A
He said that the team will use “quasi-experimen-
tal” methods to evaluate the effectiveness of Peace

through Development, comparing communities that V

have received aid through the program with similar
communities that have not. He said that the methods
will differ from those of a true experiment, where
researchers would be able to select a truly random
sample; In this case, there are not enough communi-
ties that have received the program for the research-

ers to select a random sample.

The researchers will match the communities based
on similarities in factors that would affect their vul-
nerability to extremism. These factors primarily
include what he called “population pressures related
to youth,” such as limited employment and education.

‘ Belasco said the researchers will also try to avoid
using communities that were receiving aid from other
organizations such as the European Union or United
Nations, because such communities would not serve
as suitable “controls.”

The team will compile data from surveys, inter-
views and observations of focus groups. The team
will compare the values and attitudes within the com-
munities that have received the program with those
that have not. For example, the researchers might
ask how a participant feels about an ethnicity other
than his or her own. The team might then ask how
the participant would feel about sharing resources
with members.of another ethnicity in order to get a
better sense of the area’s social cohesion.

“It’s not that we wouldn’t believe someone at face
value,” Belasco said. “But that’s just another ques-
tion we ask.”

Picard said that the growing presence of extrem-

T ist groups in the Sahara and Sahel regions, which

include many West African countries, is the primary
reason for the U.S. government’s concern with de-
velopment there. ‘

Both local extremists and transnational terrorist

organizations have taken advantage of instability .

and difficulties in upholding the rule of law in the
region. Most recently, an ongoing civil war in Mali
has allowed extremist groups such as the transna-
tional al—Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which the
U.S. Department of State has recognized as a ter-

rorist group, to expand their presence in Mali and’

neighboring countries.
~ AQIM and groups like it, not only threaten stabil-
ity within the region, but openly display hostility
toward the West.
Through an organization called the Andalus Foun-
dation, AQIM has released statements through its

Twitter account. In the statements, the group has
called on African Muslims to resist the French, who
have conducted peacekeeping operations in northern
Mali sincejanuary, as well as opposed other Western
nations. "

In one post in late March, the group gloated about

— the murder of Phillipe Verdon, a French national

whom AQIM had held hostage since November 2011,
earlier in the month.

Many other West African countries; including
Liberia from 1989 to 1996 and from then again from
1999 to 2003, Sierra Leone from 1991 to 2002 and
Cote d’Ivoire from 2002 to 2007 and from 2010 to
2011; also have also seen civil wars within living
memory and continue to wrestle with obstacles to
stable governance, such as high rates of crime and
pervasive corruption.

Picard said that the goal of the Governance Group
is to include all of the countries in the Economic
Community of West African States along with Chad,
which is not a member, but borders ECOWAS member
Nigerjover the five-year period of the contract.

According to a 2012 press release from ECOWAS,
the organization collectively includes about 300 mil-
lion people. While this makes up about 4.5 percent
of the world’s population, the countries’ economies
account for. about 0.5 percent of the world’s gross
domestic product.

Aside from Peace through Development, thejointl

team of researchers from Pitt and the Mitchell Group
will also assess USAID programs aiming to improve
post—conflict social cohesion in Cote d’Ivoire and

early- -warning signs of conflict all over the region.

Belasco said that the researchers from Pitt also
hope to conduct other research projects on political
issues in the region, such as the effects of violence
on political participation. I

Though they did not place first every ‘

time, Klein ‘pointed to consistency as
the reason that Pitt won the challenge.
“I think the Ford execs really liked
that we were so even the ‘entire time 
We always showed a positive attitude
and tried our hardest  I think that
really helped us win because they saw
that we were in it to the end, and we
were trying our best at everything,”
Klein said;
* “I think the Pitt students did an out-
standing job. They had a very diverse
team that allowed them to excel in sev-
eral of the challenges,” Mason said.
Gaus said that Pitt had an advan-
tage over other teams because all four
, members intern together, working with
marketing and communications for Stu-

d‘ dent Affairs.

“I really think that we already had
kind of a good foundation fornwhat
needs to be done to reach out to people,
to communicateto people,” Gaus said.

Gaus and Klein agreed that their
victory in the College AmbassadorfChal-
lenge would increase their number of
job opportunities in the future. For
Gaus, the most beneficial aspectjof the
College Ambassadorgghallenge was the

of recommendation or talking to them
about career advice,” Gaus said.

The winners were able to choose
from ﬁve Ford vehicles. Of the four team
members, two selected the Ford Fusion,
one chose the hybrid C-Max and one will
drive the Escape. ,

Klein selected the Ford Escape to
drive this August.because she is mov-
ing, and it offers the most space for
furniture. She plans to spend the $500
while in London this summer.

Gaus said he will spend his winnings
on a smartphone because he does not
have one and believes that being able
to communicate by email more easily
will assist him in his future career. He
chose the Ford Fusion to drive this Au-
gust because he thought it was the most
luxurious of the vehicles offered.

He also looks forward to the team’s
trip to Ford’s Great Lakes Marketing
office in»Chicago, where he hopes to
network with the executives and receive
career advice. .

“The money and the car is cool, but
going to Chicago and meeting with the
Ford executives is going to be hopefully
one of the most rewarding parts of this
whole thing,” Gaus said. I

OPINIONS  

A battle between idealism and reality:
Who isthe best choice for mayor?

Ankur Sakaria
Opinions Editor

President Lincoln aptly noted “that government
of the people, by the people, for the people, shall
not perish from the earth.” Jake Wheatley, a
mayoral‘ candidate, has embodied these words
throughout his tenure as an elected official of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Jake Wheatley began in public service as a
United States Marine serving during the Persian
Gulf War. At the conclusion of his tour, he was
given two books to read by another lieutenant:
“The Autobiography of Malcolm X” and “The Art
of War.” Wheatley said in a recent WPTS News
interview that “[the] books changed [his] life
forever.” _

After graduating from the North Carolina
Agricultural and Technical State University, he
travelled to Pittsburgh to pursue a Master of Pub-
lic Administration in political science from the
University of Pittsburgh and acquired his intro-
duction to Pennsylvania politics as a clerk for a
city councilman before moving to a chief of staff’
position. He began his tenure as a Pennsylvania
House Representative in 2003.

In 2013, Wheatley decided it was time to be

the change Pittsburgh has been ready for, in his _

opinion, and run for mayor.

Wheatley’s approach to the mayoral race thus
far has been commendable. He doesn’t worry
about the other candidates or their tactics and
negative television advertisements. Rather, he
only tries to advocate himself and shed light on
the initiatives he wants to see become actual
policy. Ideologically, there’s little wrong with
him. However, realistic projections of the mayoral
race’s outcome have resulted in little distinction
of the ideological soundness of Wheatley.

The centerpiece of Wheatley’s policy propos-
als is a substantial eradication of poverty, along
with his secondary goal to re—enfranchise the
disenfranchised African-American community.
Because of its infeasibility, his ultimate goal isn’t
to completely vanquish poverty from Pittsburgh,
but he’s aiming to use a multifaceted approach
to combat poverty and slow the deterioration of
impoverished neighborhoods such as the Hill
District, Homewood and Wilkinsburg.

His ﬁrst approach is to create a “land bank”

where private realtors, the city and local com- 4

munities can engage in a continual relationship
to acquire diminished properties and invest in
their upkeep and renovation. This investment
will increase their property value and market-
ability, opening up new sources of property tax
for the city. Wheatley stresses that it’s the city’s
responsibility to ensure that the neighborhoods
of Pittsburgh are as livable as surveys and reports
have noted them to be, disallowing these methods
from becoming an accolade that neglects the
neighborhoods struggling to survive.

His second approach is to create a more
skilled workforce by establishing job training
programs and sites where those who require
skills to apply for a particular position are able
to learn them. There are currently ‘‘29,000‘ 3' obs

in this region that are unfulﬁlled because they
cannot ﬁnd the rightly trained folks,” Wheatley
asserted. Jobs available in Pittsburgh’s natural re-
source market are rampant. Wheatley notes that
Marcellus, Shale, a natural gas- drilling industry,
is, among other examples, a reason to prepare
individuals’ to enter industries that demand labor.
Coupled with training workers outside of edu-
cational institutions, Wheatley wants to hone
in on providing and supporting investments to
furtherlimprove schools, colleges and universities
that need funding for modernization. Wheatley
believes that by focusing on schools, we can catch
those who are “falling [in the] cracks.” ‘
Wheatley noted the signiﬁcant amount of

. children who live in underrepresented areas in
Pittsburgh. For instance, 32.3 percent of Afri-

can-American children under 5 years of age in

. Pennsylvania are considered to be some of the

most impoverished children in the nation. That
ranks Pennsylvania-in the top 10 states that have
an overwhelming amount of children under 6
years of age who live in poverty. By improving
our educational system, along with attacking
the issue of poverty through a wide-reaching
approach, Wheatley hopes to stunt the growth
of impoverished communities. By assisting other
districts of the city to move to a state of substan-
tially reduced crime and disenfranchisement,
Pittsburgh can truly be considered one of the
most livable cities in the country.

When asked about modernizing the infra-
structure of Pittsburgh, Wheatley mentioned how
avidof an outdoor runner he is. His passion to
run has echoed throughout his goals to improve
the culture of running and cycling by bettering
the roads, streets and paths on which people
can do so in Pittsburgh. Wheatley posited that
although there are some areas that have proper
cycling lanes and sidewalks for citizens to walk
and run on, the entire city’s road infrastructure
is severely outdated. Wheatley wants to see city
roads, along with roads in suburban neighbor-
hoods, to provide adequate space for bicycle lanes
along with paving and maintaining sidewalks on
a year-round basis. That, coupled with altering
the mindset Pittsburghers have toward cyclists

and runners, must be improved, Wheatley said.

Wheatley also commented on the recent ﬁre
on Zulema Street in South Oakland. When asked
what he would do to ensure landlords remain
accountable for their actions, he referenced
the Bureau of Building Inspection. He claimed
that there are only seven inspectors who are
employed to deal with the housing properties
in all of Pittsburgh. One proposition Wheatley

QJFROM PAGE 4

      

mentioned is to ensure that there are more inspectors hired
to oversee fair property practices and to work with landlords
to raise the living standard of their properties. He proposed
the creation of some sort of online system on which students
who wish to live in prospective off- campus housing can view
the property online to check for previous damages, renova-
tions and other relevant attributes.

Wheatley essentially encompasses the needs of Pittsburgh.
For one, he is ready to move Pittsburgh into an age where its
impoverished neighborhoods no longer act as a blemish that
tarnishes the city’s reputation of livability. For another, he’s
the only candidate who seems to introduce policies that are
both real and practical. He might not be the best politician
out of the group of candidates, but he is the right choice.

However, Wheatley is an idealistic choice for mayor. It’s

wishful thinking to believe that Wheatley will actually become
Pittsburgh’s mayor in November.

Polls have painted an abysmal path to victory for Wheat-
ley relative to Peduto and Wagner. With that said, we must
consider the reality of the situation. Peduto and Wagner are
the frontrunners of the race, with both interchanging the
lead. A vote for Wheatley evidently only means there will be
one less vote for either of these candidates. So how can those
advocating Wheatley maximize their vote?

A vote for Peduto is the clear choice.

Peduto poses an agenda that doesn’t reverse the mod-
ernization of Pittsburgh, but rather, bolsters the movement.
Peduto’s activism in the small business sector of the city is also
promising, as he shares similarities with Wheatley’s policy
initiatives to support lower— and middle—class families. More-
over, Peduto, accompanied by the leadership of Wheatley,
poses a friendlier and more productive environment relative
to a Wagner-Wheatley combination.

It’s entirely idealistic for one to support Wheatley, given
political campaigns hold both endorsements and capital as

signiﬁcant components and that recent polls haven’t been
friendly to Wheatley. However, we must strive to put our vote
toward a candidate who will give us the most return for our
investment. Wheatley has been outdone and out-fundraised by
Wagner and Peduto, and when it comes down to the reality of
the situation, avote to Peduto will be a vote for the likelihood
that Wheatley’s policies will be considered for enactment.

“The city won’t fall off the map if the next mayor comes
in and doesn’t address poverty,” Wheatley noted.

But what it will do is continue the “divisive culture where
there are accolades of Pittsburgh,” touting how livable and
prosperous of a place it is for individuals to settle and raise
a family while there exists a “large segment of [the] Pitts-
burgh citizenry” that is considered some of the worst off
in the nation.

One important fact remains uncontested: The city of
Pittsburgh needs every citizen, and especially every student,
to vote in the upcoming election for mayor. g

IMPULSE

Pitt grad
chooses control
over proﬁt

Matt Singer
Staff W rizfer

There’s an old quote from George Bernard
Shaw in which he says that he ﬁnished his
ﬁrst book 76 years before it was published.
He claims to have sent it to “every publisher
on the English-speaking earth” that he knew
of. Fifty years later, he said, the same publish-
ers would produce anything with his name
on it. Publishing a book without the name
recognition of an A—list literary VIP is dif-
ﬁcult. It was laborious in Shaw’s day, and it
still is today. The only difference is that now,
entrepreneurial writers can bring matters
into their own hands by publishing their
own work, cutting out the middleman and
taking control of the publishing process.
Case in point: Alexander Rigby. Rigby, the
23-year-old author of “The Second Chances
of Priam Wood,” is a 2012 Pitt graduate who
studied anthropology and political science.
In the fall of 2011, during his penulti-
mate semester, Rigby developed the idea

ithat would later manifest into his novel. In '

{January of his senior year, he took hisideas
. to paper and began to work on “The Second
j Chances of Priam Wood,” a story about a
 man who receives the chance to relive and
 re-enact seven speciﬁc days of his life.

“I was fascinated with the idea of, if you
change something in your life — if you
change just one thing — how does that
change the rest of your life?” he said in an
interview with The Pitt News. A work—study
student and a member of Pitt’s chapter of the

' nationally recognized co—ed service fraterni-
ty Alpha Phi Omega, Rigby would oftentimes

write after class or late into the night. After .

graduation, he found himself using his free
{time to continue working on his novel.“It
{was basically my whole life for a while,” he
"said, describing the time commitment as
‘ an endeavor that shouldn’t be taken lightly.
; “Alex is extremely dedicated to his writ-
 I-ie devotes a slice of his time nearly
3‘-’every day to the writing and editing process,”
«.,-,:Michae1Ploetz, a 2012 Pitt graduate and close
Eﬁiend of Rigby, said in an email. ’
-:2 ‘ When hebegan writing his novel, Rigby
 sure alone. But as he put more time and en-
ergy into “The Second Chances of Priam
‘ Wood,” he found himself wanting to share
it with others. . ~

Exuding poise and confidence, Dicapro plays the rate of Jay Gatsby in the beloved novei’s newest adaptation. MCT Campus

Indelible parties and booming music are
linchpins of Gatsby. Fitzgerald mocked and
satirized the over—abundance of the 19205 when
he regimented his faceless, nameless masses to
West Egg’s festivities, and in Luhrmann’s version
they’re still partying, with Gatsby’s parties as
intoxicatingly rapturous as ever. At the forefront
of the production they are an unholy polym-
erization of Fergie and ﬂappers, capturing the
bewildered viewers’ attention and undoubtedly
provokingdisgust in die-hard literary 

Yes, the parties look cool and crazy and seem
to eat up more screen time than actual charac-
ter interactions, but Gatsby is more than just a
story about love and the American Dream -— it
is a story about love and the American Dream
engulfed in a vulgar devotion to excess.

Adecidedly modern soundtrack, produced
byjay-Z, constantly thumps in the background
oftheﬁlm. Through ablend of tastefully selected
modern cuts, including tracks from artists such
as Lana Del Rey and Florence And The Machine,
it highlights the absurd grandiosity ofjay Gatsby
and his dinner guests. _

Many have bemoaned the soundtrack, but
it complements Luhrmann’s take on the clas-
sic novel quite nicely. “Gatsby” isn’t rooted in
historical accuracy: It is a caricature of the era.
Tinny-sounding 19205 hits would feel campy
amidst Luhrmann’s dazzling rendition. The
scenes that feature the most music aren’t sup-
posed to be adored: They’re meant to revolt

people into an excruciatingly hypercritical
mindset, which can then tear off the gilded
lamination, revealing Fitzgerald’s criticisms
that the ﬁhn communicates.

Leonardo DiCaprio departs from his recent

habit of playing a boisterous, screaming ball-

of rage to give a pitch-perfect rendition ofjay
Gatsby. DiCaprio pares down his edginess just
enough to align with Gatsby’s signature poise.
He is desire incarnate, wrapped in a ﬁnely
pressed suit. .

The role of the great Jay Gatsby requires

equal parts demure and grandeur. Gatsby him-
self isn’t supposed to be attention-worthy His
jaundiced ﬁxation on social mobility isn’t so
much manifested inhimas itis inhis self-made
environment, and DiCaprio plays the part al-
most perfectly. Even in a bright pink suit Di-
Caprio doesn’t steal the spotlight.

The veneer of Jay Gatsby — his cool, his
money, his fancy cars — doesn’t require an ac-
tor to create it. It just is. DiCaprio demonstrates
more of an identity than a complete man and
looks like he’s acting. DiCaprio plays a man
who is playing a man and seems”, perfectly
comfortable doing so. ‘V

Opposite DiCaprio is Carey Mulligan,
who portrays Daisy Buchanan as a pale en-
chantress with a captivating pair of puppy-
dog eyes. She drifts listlessly along with a

est change in the way they View the world
and the people around them,” said Ploetz.

But with the decision to share his story
came the question of how to do so. One

 optism V§l?IS.t.0—.S'€f;1Cl itt9;‘a1itsrary agent to
jre’.V_iew,r.ra process‘ that takes atleast several
2 months to ycornplete. The literary agent’s

review deterrfiiries whether or not he or
she will then try to pitch it to publishing
companies, which can takeeven longer. _.

Another option was for Rigby to publish
the book himself, losing the ﬁnancial ‘back-
ing that traditional publishing provides
while retaining control over the pace of the
publishing effort and his ultimate product.

Rigby chose the latter.

In deciding to work independently rath-
er than through a publisher, Rigby earned
a blank slate, engineering everything from
the cover photo to the font size. The length
of the book, the intricacies of the plot and
the characters’ interactions also remained

a under the decision of Rigby.

Publishers have the final say in all mat-‘
ters relevant tothe iprocess arid‘ maintaih
this power because authors must sign over
the rights to their content if they wish to
have their work published — something

Rigby described as a choice between a wid-

er audience orwstronger sen_se.of.control.
Rigby learned much of whathe knows
about publishing from his job ‘at Dor-

\II.=x1 m _’l [U n1u\‘l.. l'mwHz ll) lh-mxxmn

rance Publishing in downtown Pittsburgh,
though he didn’t work with them while he
published his book.

“I realized ‘Hey, I know a lot about this,
and I can do everything the way that I want
to,”’ he said. “The main reason was that I
wanted to get this book out there, and I
felt comfortable enough with what I knew
about publishing, and so not only was I was
able to do so, but it was the most practical
way to do so.” '

To him, the process of self—promotion
was an excellent way to connect readers
and “indie authors,” or fellow writers who
chose to avoid signing with a publisher. He
speciﬁcally mentioned Twitter as a useﬁil
platform, and readers can follow his @
Author_Alex account, where he frequently
tweets directly to fans about their opinions,
reviews, critiques and feedback.

The Internet also served as a well of
information on the publishing process.
Though he came in with some experience,
when Rigby did need to bridge the gap
between his know-how and what had to be
done, he was able to do so with relative ease
thanks to the multitude of tutorials avail-
able for layout and publishing programs.

“It just amazes me all the time how on
the ball he is with things,” said Rose Selby,
a co-worker of Rigby’s at Dorrance Publish-
ing who helped with the books interior

On its debut album, Curiosity, Portland,
Ore.-based Wampire treatslisteners to
nine tracks of keyboard—induced bliss.
The music is loaded with a soft, slightly
poppy ambiance and the simple, subtle
songwriting harkens back to shoegaze
roots and archetypal pop mechan-
ics. ‘ T» _ 4

_ Wampire uses Casio-style keyboards
in Ways that are both creative and oddly
nostalgic. The band’s sound calls to
mind memories of beat-up old key-
boards strewn throughout basements
across the United States and features
a carnival—like resonance with tones to

_ choose from. Curiosity features plenty

of these idiosyncratic keyboard sounds
and does so very well —— if not com-
pletely tastefully — without coming
off as trying too hard to be avant-garde.
The album’s first track, “The
Hearst,” begins with a few chords that
make the listener reminisce of the days
of Dark Crystal and Labyrinth — in-

credibly foreboding tones that grab .

you immediately. Soon the song kicks
in with pop—induced rhythms galore,
though the synth and organs remain
at the forefront. A

Forming the foundation of the al-
bum are melodic bass and rhythmic

. guitar parts, all meshing seamlessly

among the full production of the al-
bum, immersing listeners in the bouncy
rhythms of each track . The sound is
very complete —- a fact that goes rela-
tively unnoticed until the silence that
ensues during the song “Giants,”4when
it becomes apparentjust how enthrall-
ing this album can become

sic takes on a life of its own, not falling

Wampire makes deft use of Casio Key»
boards on Curiosity Robbie Augsburger

victim to the uncomfortable mash of
ill-fitting pieces.

‘ Curiosity features guitar solos,
which have become relatively nonexis-
tent today. Rarely are bands making it a
priority to showcase fancy guitar work.
But for Wampire, the distorted, Wah-
Wah pedal-ladened sections become
oddly clever and relatively digestible,
by no means distracting from the songs
where they aredisplayed most promi-
nently songs such as “Spirit Forest.”

The album has a few flaws that keep

it from being a'can’t—miss release. The .

songs on the album begin to mesh over
time, making individual tracks rela-
tively indeﬁnable. And while the collec-
tion of songs is strong, there’s no true
standout track to recommend.

That being said, Wampire succeeds
where many bands do not.,Curiosity
does not come off as an homage to the
synth—loving days of the ‘B05, but, in-
stead, deftly utilizes those elements and
makes them its own. The music seems
honest and is truly a treat for listeners.

Theback-to-basics songwriting is
another strength prevalent throughout
the album. The formula might be simple
— start with a melody, incrementally
add more instruments, build up and
fade out, then start over again — but
it works. The vocal stylings follow suit,‘
not trying to accomplish too much, just
following the lead of the melody.

Wampire’s Curiosity is for fans of
‘8os revivalists Twin Shadow and the
Pitchfork—adored indie rock band,
Foxygen. With vocals _akin to Jim Reid,
the lead singer of The Jesus and Mary
Chain, Wampire comes highly recom-
mended for fans of the post—punk genre.

SOFTBALL
Disappointing
season ends for

Panthers

Dave Uhrmacher
Sports Editor

The Pitt softball team’s performance this
season was underwhelming to say the least.

But as injuries and fielding blunders
bogged down Pitt’s winning percentage,
one Panther was making the most of her

inaugural campaign at the collegiate level.

Freshman outﬁelder Tori Nirschl trav-
eled along way from her home in Carlsbad,
Calif., to play collegiate softball at Pitt, but
ever since she set foot on campus, she has
had every intention of making an impact.

“When I came-to Pitt I—‘_hoped to work
hard and make an immediate impact, and I
was glad to‘ have aneopportunity’to' do that,”

said Nirschl. “As a freshiman,iit is not rare

to have that chance, but it was-exciting to
play every inning. I deﬁnitely have areas of
improvement for next year, but it’s a good
foundation for me. I’m just excited to just

"I get better and play next season.”

On Wednesday, May 8, Nirschl, who
was recently named Big East Rookie of
the Year, became the ﬁrst-ever Pitt soft-
ball player to receive a major conference
or national award at the Big East Softball
Awards Banquet in Tampa, Fla.

Though N irschl prospered in her inau-
gural season, earning third team All—Big
East honors, Pitt’s overall season did not
go as originally planned.

The Panthers’ (19-29, 8-14 Big East)

7 3‘ season ended May 5, following a three-

game set with Rutgers (30-26, 8-14 Big
East), in which the Panthers won two of
three games.

Still, Pitt locked in a ninth-place tie,
leaving the team two spots out of a confer-
ence tournament berth.

So after entering the season with the
hope of taking a big step forward before
moving to the Atlantic Coast Conference,
injuries to key players and lengthy losing
streaks resulted in a lustless campaign
for Pitt.

“I think the main thing was just a lack of
bringing all aspects of the game together,”
senior catcher Holly Stevens said. “It was
either our hitting doing well or the pitch-

; ing doing well and, when we brought those

two things together, we seemed to play our
best games and show our full potential.”

The Pitt baseball team recorded its eighth
sweep of the season over Mother’s Day
weekend at the expense of Big East foe
Villanova, the cellar dwellers of the con-
ference.

Pitt (40-11, 18-3 Big East) took over

first place in the conference with its
sweep of Villanova (11-39, 2-19 Big East)
at Charles L. Cost Field in a series that
featured one tightly contested game and a
pair of dominant efforts by the Panthers.

Pitt topped Villanova 4-3 in the series
opener on Saturday, 12-4 in the back end
of Saturday’s doubleheader and 10-2 in the
series ﬁnale on Sunday. Sunday’s victory
marked a Pitt program record, as the team
reached the 40-win mark for the first time
in school history.

Additionally,the win represented a
milestone for head coach Joe Jordano as
the 75 0th win of his head coaching career.

“As I said to the
squad after the
game, thisisn’t.
the finish line.”

Joe Jordana.

“I’m very happy for the team in ac-
complishing something that no other Pitt
baseball team has accomplished, which is
winning 40 games,”Jordano said in a press
release. “As I said to the squad after the
game, this isn’t the ﬁnish line.”

Game 1: Pitt 4, Villanova 3

Ethan Mildren made the start in his

usual slot as the rotation’s ace and de-

' livered seven shutout innings. Mildren

struck out seven Wildcats and allowed

_ just five hits.

Mildren exited the game with a 3-0
lead and was in line for his 10th win of the
season, butjon Danielczyk andjoe Harvey
allowed three runs in the eighth and ninth
innings, resulting in a tie ballgame in the
bottom of the ninth.

The Panthers loaded the bases off Vil-
lanova’s Kevin MacLachlan before he was
pulled in favor of Chris Haggarty to face
Pitt second baseman Dylan Wolsonovich.

Wolsonovich came through for Pitt with a »

single to score outﬁelder Steven Shelinsky
and give Pitt the Victory: 1

‘.‘I don’t think it was anything speciﬁc
this weekend. We just try going out every
game with the same approach and inten-
sity,’;’.% Shelinsky said. “We just continue to
take it one game at a time. We wanted to
have quality at—bats, and we know what .are
getting from the pitchers, just the same
thing everyday.”

junior Carvin Nkanata continued his impres-

career-best time of 20.83, which he ran one
week ago at the Big East Tournament.

This advancement came en route to a

May 12, at the ECAC—IC4A Championships at
Princeton University.

The 20.32—second sprint marks a new
career best for Nkanata and was the second-
fastest time posted across the nation, behind
Texas A&M seniorAmeer Webb’s 20.30 at the
SEC Championship on Sunday.

Seniorjulia Koloski also took home an

individual title in the triple jump, posting a

career-best mark of 12.90 meters.

sisting of seniors Ashley Woodford,jon- V

Gamez: Pitt 12, Villanova 4

V>’§l?‘After narrowly avoiding defeat at the
hands of a team with the worst conference
record, Pitt took care of business against
Villanova later in the evening.

But not before the Wildcats took their
first lead of the weekend, scoring one run
in the ﬁrst inning for an early'1—o lead.
From there, Pitt scored 11 unanswered
runs to put the second part of Saturday’s
contest out of the Wildcats’ reach.

Hitting in the two -hole behind outﬁelder
Stephen Vranka, catcher Elvin Soto reward-
edjordano for moving him up in the lineup
with a 2-for-4 day at the plate, four runs
and a two-run home run in the ﬁfth inning.

Matt Wotherspoon (9-1) took the
mound for Pitt, earning his ninth win
of the season after pitching six innings
and allowing one run on four hits while
striking out nine batters.

In a Mother’s Day matinee, Pitt took a
5-0 lead after the first three innings and
never looked back. Rhys Aldenhoven (8-

eight—inning outing in which he allowed
just two unearned runs.

“We just have to continue to, play well
and execute everything. We seem to be
clicking right now,” the junior pitcher

said. “I have to keep the ball down in the

Referees deserve respect from
fans, players

Ellie Petrosky
Assistant Opinions Editor

Respect is a value that has been taught to
sports teams as long as they have been in
existence. But recently there have been a
slew of stories about the disrespect be-
tween referees and players in the world of
soccer suggesting that, maybe, respect is
not held in as high regard as it used to be.

Long gone are the days when opponents
would congratulate each other willingly on
a good pass, move or match. Lost are the
moments when opposing coaches would

shake hands with each other, grins on their _

faces, commending each other on a battle

well—fought. Left behind are games during ’

which a player would help an opponent
up after knocking him down in the play
before. Erased are the times when coaches
would wholeheartedly thank and show ap-
preciation for the referees who officiated
their game. .

Unfortunately for soccer lovers like
me, the news of unsportsmanlike conduct
during soccer games reaches public atten-
tion much more often than heartwarming
stories of opponents looking out for and
assisting each other.

just recently, there have been two inci-
dents of soccer players attacking referees

V after calls did not go their way.
During an Indonesian Premier League f

game on April 21, Persiwa Wamena player

V Pieter Rumaropen punched referee Wasit

Muhaimin in the face after one of his team-
mates was called for a foul inside the pen-
alty box, resulting in a penalty kick for the
opposing Pelita Bandung Raya. Members
of Persiwa argued with the referee over the
foul, but none as violently as Rumaropen,
who punched the referee in the face.
Muhaimin was sent to the hospital be-
cause of profuse bleeding from his face
that required stitches. A replacement of-
ﬁcial issued a red card to Rumaropen, who
was then sentenced to a lifetime ban from
league play by the IPL disciplinary board.
On April 27, referee Ricardo Portillo

‘V was attacked by a teenaged player while
‘ refereeing a soccer game between two Utah

club teams. Portillo had blown his whistle

: on the player for a foul committed during

a corner kick. The foul resulted in Portillo

L issuing a yellow card to.the player, who im-
I mediately began arguing with the referee

over the call. As Portillo was writing down
the details of the yellow card, the player

A landed a punch to the referee’s jaw.

Portillo was taken to a hospital where

. he lapsed into a coma and eventually died

as a result of his injuries. The player who

~ attacked Portillo has been held in a juvenile

detention center and is being charged with

, homicide by assault. »

As the daughter and sister of soccer
referees and a former referee myself, I’m

it horrified by the lack of respect shown»t~o~-  

ward referees in soccer games today. The
thought that someone I love could leave
home to ofﬁciate a game and never return
is terrifying and unnecessary.

Believe me, I understand that referees
are not perfect, as I’ve been on both sides
of the whistle. But, as a player, a call that
doesn’t go your way isn’«t grounds for at-

* tacking the person who made it. The root

of this issue lies with parents and coaches
not holding their children and players ac-
countable fortheir own actions.

Coaches should enforce penalties for
arguing with a referee over a call. In my ex-
perience, the moment someone mouthed
off to a referee was the moment his or
her butt met the bench. I have never had
a coach whotoleratedthe act of talking
back to a referee.

In addition, parents should also hold
their children accountable for their behav-
ior on the ﬁeld. When kids are on the field,
they might remain under the supervision
of another adult, but it is still up to the

. parents to enforce the same conduct on

the field that they expect at home.

From the very first time players put
on their shin guards and cleats, coaches
and parents should teach them to respect
the referees. They should understand that
there are penalties for being impudent to-
ward referees. Before every game, coaches
should remind them to take their fouls in
stride and consider them to be construc-
tive criticisms instead of personal attacks.
They should be told that they’re going to
make mistakes and that they’re not per-
fect. They should be told that even though
they will be called for fouls at one time or
another, they should take responsibility
for their missteps, learn from them and
focus on the next play, even if they don’t
agree with the call. They should be told
why referees are there and why they call
the fouls they do.

Referees aren’t present at sporting
events to make life difficult for the teams,
choose sides or to be a pain. Nor are they
there to be choked, abused or used as
punching bags. Referees are present at
sporting events to keep play safe and to
keep players from incurring unnecessary
injuries.

Many referees, especially at the recre-
ational level, arevolunteers who take time
out of their lives to keep your loved ones
safe during their contests. They shouldn’t
be worried about putting themselves at
risk for bodily harm while working to keep
others safe. _

As"--with any profession, there is risk,
but thzat risk shouldn’t be magnified by
players throwing tantrums and left hooks
because they don’t get their way.

Referees should be paid in respect,
rather than with injury. I

Pitt to host Penn State for first time since 2005

Notable Big Ten-ACC Challenge matchups

The showdown has pitted Atlantic Coast Conference and Big Ten teams since 1999.

Dave Uhrmacher
Sports Editor

The Atlantic Coast Conference and Big
Ten announced on Wednesday the slate of
games that will make up the Big Ten-ACC
Challenge for this upcoming basketball
season.

For the first time since Dec. 10, 2005,
Pitt will host in—state rival Penn State on
Dec. 3 at the Petersen Events Center.

Penn State is Pitt’s oldest rival and
second-most common opponent in the
program’s history.

The Panthers have found success
against their Keystone State foes as of
late, winning 10 of the last 13 contests,
including two matchups at the Petersen
Events Center.

Since their ﬁrst meeting during the
1905-1906 season, Penn State holds a 75-
70 advantage in the 145 games played in
the series.

“It’s not often that you can pair ri-
vals in the Big Ten-ACC Challenge,” Pitt
head coach Jamie Dixon said in a press
release. “Obviously ESPN jumped on this

opportunity, and it ﬁgures tobe an excit-

ing matchup for the players, fans and the
entire state of Pennsylvania.”
Beginning in 1999, the ACC won 10

straight ACC—Big Ten Challenges, followed
by three victories for the Big Ten and cul-
minating in a tie last season with each
conference taking home six victories. W

Despite the lopsided record, both con-
ferences consist of national powerhouse
programs that account for six national
titles since 2000 and a total of nine teams
making Final Four appearances since the
turn of the century.

The Big East/SEC Challenge was can-
celled following the departure of marquee
programs to other conferences.

The ESPN family of networks will
combine to televise all 12 games over the
two-day span in the battle for conference
supremacy and the right to hoist the Com-
missioner’s Cup. A 0

Of the 15 teams in the ACC, Virginia
Tech, Georgia Tech and Wake Forest were
left off this year’s slate of games.

The 15th annual Big Ten-ACC Challenge
will take place on Dec. 3-4 at 14 different
conference sites. The two-day event fea-
tures eight teams included in the ESPN.
com preseason top 25 poll.

The dates and times of Pitt’s full con-

ference and nonconference schedule for
the upcoming 2013-2014 season will be’

released at a later date. I
