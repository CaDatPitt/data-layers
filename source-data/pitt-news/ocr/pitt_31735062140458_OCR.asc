University to Adopt  

1

Most complete civilian defense
plan in the district will shortly" be
adopted by the University, it was
announced . today.

‘ .Expected .to. take ellecl: imme- A
, diately after the start of the sec-
. ond semester, the‘: plaxfis based on

a detailed ‘survey ofconditions. in
Europe made by Washington au-
thorities. Pitt is expected to take
the lead ‘over surrounding commu-
nities in air-raid “protection, first
aid, fire protection and the general
problem of civilian morale. A -

The program Will be divided into
two divisions: oneofor the protec- -
tion of ‘life and property, the oth-
er ‘for the maintenance of morale.

A student board of six men and
four women met yesterday ,with
Uniyersity Coordinator, Dr. E. W.
Jacobson to discuss: the role that
the Students will play in the dual
program. ~ - .
_ Facugl-ty,members talented along ~

certain lines have  “drafted"
to 1 head specialized A divisions. Dr.

  Total Defense Plane

Paul Larimer McLain, assistant
professor of physiology. and phar-
macology, and Dr. Dorothy Rood,
professor of public health nursing,
are in charge of the first-aid and
nursing divisions, respectively.

.  Nelson Park Davis,‘ field in-
structor in case work, has been
placed in charge of the physical
ﬁtness program for western Penn-
sylvania. , ’

Another section of the vast pro-
gram, called the Special Service
Committee, will be run by Dr. Ash-
er Isaacs, associate’ professor of
economics. His assignment is to reg
cruit a student and a faculty staff.
to carry out the program on every
floorof the Cathedral and in other
campus buildings.

Immediately after registration
Dr. McLain will conduct a special
first-aid course for those interested.

The faculty group is (being or-
.gani::ed now and ..the student “staff
will be enrolled for positions dur-
ing second 1 semester registration.

 SFA Elects New om-cm,-
Plans [Battleship Drivel

By v“SFAyers - V _
SFA‘ met last A Wednesday mght

-—-started plans fora nation-wide L

drive to buy a battleship; accepted
the resignation of its president,
0 Roy Ruane, and its secretary, Char-
“ lotte Harris; elected their success-
ors; and referred to committee an
.Independent' motion to ‘suspend
politics Ext the University for the
duization of the war. . ._ _
New SFA resident. is Ed Tait,
former vice-president. New, vice-
president is Charlotte Harris, for-
" mer secretary. New secretary is
Julia DeLeo, former assembly
'member. New assembly member is
\ Hiram Milton, former‘ non-assem-
bly member.

Most important piece; of business
passed was thexnotion that the as-
sembly launch a drive to. be ex-
tended tdcampuses throughout the

country to raise funds for the pur- '

chase of a. battleship. Originator
of the plan, Herbert Gall, E42, was
made chairmanof a committee to
begin plans. for the .drive.
Most lively bit. of argument of
the evening came when new mem-
7, ber Milton, producing a ten-foot
'0 long petition with over one hun-

f“ dred signers, introduced his amend-

ment calling for “unity in the face
of the national emergency.”

Such unity‘ would be obtained,
according to Milton’s amendment,
by eliminating the political rivalry
bellwee-in fraternities and independ-
ents. Seats in the assembly would

\ be equally divided between the two
groups (twenty-two to both) with
each selecting its own members to
the organization. Thus, should the
‘plan be adopted, lF council would
probably select the fraternity rep-
resentatives, and IA the independ-
ents this spring. 

There seemed little opposition to
Mi1ton’s proposed plan, with most
of the independent members of the
group speaking favorably for it,
and most of the fraternity mem-
bers of the association evidently
too surprised by the sudden move to
offer criticism of the plan, until

Charles Cusick, PiKA, spoke

against it. A . I C

Cusick labelled the plan “just
another attempt ofthe Independ-
ent party to use this national emer-
gency. to further its own ends.”

Most forgotten bit of procedure
was the resignation of Tait from
his vice-presidency. OK boys, let's
start all over.

i   Graham Named Adviser »
To Student Publications 

Robert X. Graham, director of"

the University News service and in-
structor in English, has ‘been ap-

he served as faculty adviser to
student publications. He had held
similar positions" at Westminster

college and PCW.

A These further steps were taken this week."

to aid the government speed up the educa-
tional program of the University and of the
rest of the nation’s educational system:

(1) the University published (below) a
study questionnaire designed to aid the Uni-

versity in planning a summer trimester,

(2)‘ the Association of American Colleges
released 8 resolutions which were adopted at
the association’s annual meeting in Baltimore
on January 2, 1942, reported in the Pitt News
(Jan; 5 and 7, 1942).

A meeting of educational leaders took place
yesterday, January 8, in Washington to sug-
gest speciﬁc policies which the government
might follow in the future.

The Questionnaire

The following questionnaire was released
from the University committee in charge of
studying an accelerated program.

i The questionnaire is for. study only. It is

NOT to be ﬁlled in and returned to any oflice. ‘

' A duplicate of this questionnaire will be

distributed at registration and it shouldrbe

University of Pittsburgh

Questionnaire for all 
Second.Semester, 1941-42

» As‘ a. defense’ measure, universities have
been asked to give instruction throughout
the calendar year. . .

At this University such a plan might in-
volve adding a 15-week summer trimester to
the twoysemesters. This would increase by 50
percent the speedrof progress toward degrees.
Present juniors would save four months,
sophomores eight «months, freshmen A 12
months, and prospective freshmen 16 months.
Many men would be able to earn baccalaure-
ate degrees before reaching the present draft
age of 20 years. ~

Vllomen students also could accelerate their ~

preparation for defense occupations.

The amount of tuition charged in 12
months for those who enroll in three consecu-
tive trimesters would also increase by 50 per-
cent , ($450.00 for the year instead of
$300.00). Part time schedules and costs
would be affected proportionately.

The trimesters next year might begin in
June, October, and February.

You will help us to reorganize on the tri-
mester basis by answering the following spe-
ciﬁc questions to the best of your ability.

The Eight Resolutions

The resolutions adopted‘ by the Association?
American Colleges at their January .2. (meeting 3;}:

as follows:

_ (1) Resolved that the Association of Americ
Colleges expresses its gratitude and appreciation“
the President of the United States for hislett

December 29, 1941.

’ We accept the grave responsibility which fl
emergency places‘ upon us, which, as the Preside,
said, consists in our helping the country “to win)
war. At the same time it is perfectly ’clea_r itha
— will be futile to win the war unless during its wi

ning we lay the foundations forvthe kind of pea;

ant/Lreadjustment that will guarantee the preseﬂ

' tion,of those aspects of American life for which t

War is fought.”

tion of the war, such opportunity to be governed’

tution.

(5) Tomake possible the acceleration of the e no
cational program and to compensate students fortlie
loss of summer earnings, We urge the Congress? '
provide funds in form of grants to promising, a
needy students to be made through the United Star
Oﬂice of Education and to be administered bylpitlajgx

colleges and universities.

(6) It is the considered judgment of this meet
that it is inadvisable to relax the present de
requirements for -students entering the armed"

vices.

(7) Reaflirming our conviction that all America»
institutions ‘of higher learning are eager to, rend
l maximum service in" this hour of crisisand believi
that these institutions Should be maintained) a
for war or peace, we respectfully point out that thin
unequal distribution of opportunities for milit
and naval training among such institutions ”’rep.1
sents severe discrimination against those which! do
not have this privilege and deprives the governme P

of a signiﬁcant resource.

We request, therefore, that all standard inst
tions of men, or including men, which request it 
put upon approximately the same basis in this in
portant respect of service. In view of the all
national elfort we believe that it will be great]
the advantage of our government to provide for th .
ihstitutions which. it is‘ not yet utilizing fully,-
Training Corps in which selective, physically fit 
students may be given military and other speci,
training for the war effort in connection wit it
college course and may thus ﬁnish their program.

a

We request the government to prescribe V 
training program designed to make complete use
these institutions in relation to the war effort.

To this end we ask. the president of the Associati
to appoint a cdmmittee to present immediately
mgtter to the President of the United States and};
formulate with such ofﬁcials as be

this training program. ‘ /

We are conﬁdent that the institutions and the 1
dividual members of the faculty and administrat:
staff will gladly m_ake-_the necessary sacriﬁces.

is still 'a strong inﬂuence exerted

college to carry out

Each college oruniversity, he explained, will an-
alyze the problem in the light of what each’ is best
able to produce. Those colleges which have the‘neces-
sary equipment and the most suitable teaching staffs"
to do so will concentrate on the training of engi-
neers. The same will apply to all other fields.

In short, the subject or subjects which a university
or collegetakes upon itself to specializein will be
determined by two ‘things: faculty and facilities.
This concentration entails a speed-up in the process

The spirit of the meeting as a whole, Dr. Bowman
concluded, was one of asking questions, a desire. to
co-operate and a realization that it was going to be
a long, hard war to win. ,

Dr. ,Muir thinks, however, that

Economic inequality has made

Coaches Capt. Wills, Lt. Havlalc,
and Sgt. McDonald expressed their
hopes for a victorious start.

The coaching staff announced
the impossibility of presenting the
entire season’s schedule, because
the colleges which they have con-
tacted have not, at this time, yet
accepted the challenges. l

As soon as they have heard from
the various tentative opponents,
t,he'y, expect to release a complete
schedule. In the meantime, how-
ever, the results of "the present
weekend’s matches plus‘ the on-
coming matches will be regularly
announced. . ' “

And so with ﬁre in their eyes, as
well as in their guns, the Panthers
will today be gunning for their
initial win. “P

Another swimming season is be-
ing ushered into the Panther var-
sity sports program and with it a
new swimming star is fast rising
in the championship horiz-on. Un-

-der the ever watchful eye of coach

”iBe-n Grady, the mermen are_ work-\
\ —~ing ;hard at getting into shape.

Meeting ﬁrst Rider on Feb. 2, then
Lafayette on Feb. 4, the boys are
really headed for a couple of splash
‘battles. - . ’

Team practices are held ‘three
timesa week; on Monday, Wednes-
day, and Friday. The mermen are

noon in the school week. " l ’ V’

The team was to have traveled
to Florida ags3,vate1's, during 3 the
Christmas vacation, but because ‘of
the world crisis it was decided
against niaking such a trip. On
Saturday, December 27, the team

‘ entered representatives in an ex-
hibition program in the Pittsburgh
Athletic association pool.

District swimmers were pitted
against a team of South American
aquatic’ experts. With Brazil’s

Maria Lenk, holder of the world
breaststroke record for women,
leading them, the team had little
difficulty in capturing five of the
six events..Thektangoing tankmen
éxperienced great clifficulty in try-
ing to take that sixthone, the
stumbling block being ,Pitt’s star
‘freestyle man, Gus Wilde.

Gus came from behind on the
last lap to nose out Luis Alciver of
Ecuador, in the hundred yard free
style race. The Latin visitor ap-
peared to have the race won. as he
made the last turn, but‘ Wilde stag-
ed a terriﬁc spurt. to win the nod.
What had seemed like certain de-
feat was turned into a pleasant vic-
tory for the Panther contingent.

To some people, Wilde"s win
came as 1a surprise but to Coach
Grady and Gus’s teamnmates it
was only another win in a long
string of victories that he has ac-
cumulated during his four years
on the Pittswimming team.

It seems” to be the unanimous
opinion that Wilde has ﬁnally hit
top stride. He is considered as the
nucleus of the Panther aquatic at-
tack, this year.

came out for the second half rarin’
to go. The entire Delt team made
exactly eight points in this second
period, and that’s exactly how
many Miller made. Chuck Page
was second man for the PiKA’s
with six points, followed by John
Syka and Ralph Wilde, who had
four apiece. High man for the
Delts was Bill Patterson with six
markers. ‘

In the second game of the even-
ing, the Phi Gains won their ﬁrst
game by beating the SAE’s, 36-11.
The Phi Gams were leading 16-11
at the half, and instead of sitting
on their lead in the second half,
they chose to match the SAE’s
point for point. They did that, and
more too, scoring 20 points to 10
for the losers.

The Phi Kaps, co-holders of the
league lead with the hot PiKA’_s,
won a forfeit from Sigma Chi. The
Sammies and Theta Chis double-
forfeited, as did Phi Epsilon Pi
and Lambda Chi Alpha.

Incidentally, three teams have
already been dropped from the
race because they have ‘forfeited
twice, and at least two more will
be dropped if they forfeit once
more. The eliminated teams are
Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Epsilon
Pi, ‘and Sigma Chi. '

a boy named Ranii and footballer
Matt Gebel, ran roughshod over
the Eagles last Monday night by

Sports Editor

Hellzapoppin may have left downtown Pittsburgh mt.
week, but from the Nixon theatre it went straight to the Pitli,
4 stadium, where last Wednesday evening it staged a show forl-
‘ 100 fans who braved the wintry blasts. S p ' 3. C
' It was advertised as a Pitt-Techbasketball game, but as
the contest went on, antics from the Hellzapoppin show keptf A
‘ cropping up, to the particular dismay of the 100 spectators.
Pitt won the game by the scoregof 64-34, but it could easily
have been larger. Doctor Carlson,
streams of substitutes into the contest when the score began

to grow large.

Larry Paffrath and Tay Malar-
key had a field day against their
futile rivals for they netted 18 and
14 points respectively. Little Bobby
Artman, never a marksman, con-
tributed 11 points to the‘ onslaught.

At the start of the game, the few
fans scattered throughout . the
stands could see what was to come
for the Pitt squad grabbed an ear-
ly 11-2 lead mainly through bas-
kets by co-captains Paffrath f'and
Ziolkowski. Techites Brinn and De-
Bortali made a basket apiece be-
fore the quarter’s end to bring‘ the
score to 18-5.

Footballer Henry Holets forgot
himself at the start of the second
quarter, and began tossing the Pitt-
men around. instead of the ball.
The general consensus of the fans
was that Holets is quite a football
player. ‘

The remainder of the second
quarter saw a wild orgy of pass-

es, particularly from Tech, because,

the Panthers scored 24 points "to
bring the total at half time up to
42-15 in favor of Pitt.

' Max Hannum must have given.
his team a pep—talk during the in-
termission because they came out
on the court ‘full of ﬁght, but not
points. But they did hold the su-
perior Pitt forces to a meager 13
points.

During this period Malarkey
took over the scoring reins and
rang up six points, two baskets of
which were made on the good Doc-
tor’s favorite figure 8 play, and
two more on successive fouls.

' Dave Brinn, former Allderdice
. high school star, ﬁnally came

through with threebaskets at this
time to give the Tech student man-
agers a bit of a thrill. From ad-
vance publicity, Brinn was suppos-
ed to have beeh the boy that would
stop the Panthers, if they did any
stopping. It just wasn’t his night
as he scored only seven points.

The ﬁnal quarter saw Carlson
empty his bench of substitutes, and,
