Police set for Sunday

Amy Friedenberger'
Senior Staff Writer

Many students still have vivid memories
of the chaos that followed the Pittsburgh
Steelers Super Bowl victory in 2009. So
do the police. A

City police are taking a more proactive
approach this year by shutting down some
areas in Oakland and the South Side about
an hour before the game is scheduled to
end in anticipation of increased pedes-
trian and celebratory traffic.

3 More than 400 "extra police officers
from the city, county, state and Univer-
sity department will also be on hand to
maintain order, according to city police
security plans. '

Pitt spokesman John Fedele said in
an e—mail that the University would not
discuss police and public safety tactics
prior to Sunday. Pittsburgh police spokes-
woman Diane Richard also declined to
comment on police preparation for the
post-Super Bowl celebration.

A “We’re not anticipating any sort of
riot,” she said.

City police plan to maintain order
amid the post-Super Bowl celebrations by
closing the streets and enforcing parking
restrictions. Police outlined their plans
in a four-page press release earlier this
week.

In Oakland, officers will cordon off
Forbes Avenue from McKee Place to Big-
elow Boulevard at 9 p.m., when barricades
will be into place. No parking will be per-
mitted on side streets between Sennott
Street and Fifth Avenue beginning at 4
p.m. A -

In the South Side, East Carson Street
will close betweenloth and 22nd streets

at 9 p.m. No parking will be permitted on
East Carson and side streets.

Tens of thousands of fans ﬂooded the
streets after the Steelers defeated the
Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII
in 2009. Then, police did not imple-
ment a traffic plan in anticipation of the
crowd. - .

' During the course of the night, Police
arrested about 100 celebrating people,
some who were responsible in part for the
$150,000 in damages reported by local
businesses and homeowners. '

Following the 2009 Super Bowl riots,

arrests were also made after investiga— '

tions involving online videos and pho-
tographs, a strategy likely to be repeated
this year if damages occur during post-
game celebrations.

Fedele said that 25 students were sanc-
tioned following the Super Bowl, and a
few were even suspended. Whereas the
University is not expecting students to
cause damage to University property, Fe-
dele stressed that students will be held
accountable for any damages they are
proven to have caused.

According to the police’s press release,
“Anyone caught lighting or adding items
to any ﬁres that may be ignited following
the Super Bowl game WILL incur Felony
charges which could include Arson, Risk-
ing a Catastrophe, Reckless Endanger-
ing Another Person and Criminal Mis-
chief.” '

Their warning comes after rowdy fans
celebrated the 2009 Steelers victory by
ﬂipping cars, torching couches, smashing
windows, bringing down a bus shelter and
breaking parking meters. . ‘

Bars stock up for game

Keith Gillogly
Senior Staff Writer

Oakland’s restaurants and bars are gear-
ing up for Sunday; at least, theones who
expect to see many customers during the
big game are.

There will be many thirsty fans to keep
happy during the big game Sunday, and
for some establishments in Oakland, a
busynight lies ahead. For other restau-
rants, like Fuel and Fuddle, Super Bowl
Sunday might be as quiet as the sideline
of the losing team. ' ' .

Peter’s Pub should see its share of

black-and—yellow-clad fans, but the turn- .

out will likely be about the same as on a
standard Friday or Saturday night, said
Andrew Stackiewicz, the bar’s manag-
er. Still, it plans on ordering plenty of
beer. ,
“We ‘get as much beer as possible
—— everything that can ﬁt in the cooler,”
Stackiewicz said. ‘
Stackiewicz has been at Peter’s for the

past several Super Bowls, and when the '

Steelers play, the mood jumps to a level
that is “lotimes crazier.”

Peter’s Pub plans to have a buffet on its
upper floor and Djs to ﬁll in during com-
mercial breaks. Beer will probably be the
choice drink that night, Stackiewiczsaid,
although he noted that a few customers at
past Super Bowls have taken shots every
time the Steelers scored. So if it’s a high-

scoring game, blood alcohol levels might .

go up in tandem.

Stackiewicz said everyone in the bar
rushed out to join the chaotic celebra-
tion in the streets after the,2009 Super
Bowl victory. Within -a few minutes the
bar hadnearly emptied, giving the staff
at Peter’s Pub just enough time to clean

up before the raucous crowd gushed back a

in a half an hour later to party the, rest of
the night away.

‘ _ The only unknown variable on busi-
ness owners’ minds is what will happen if
the Steelers lose. Either way, in preparing
for a very energetic crowd, Stackiewicz
said he plans to have extra bouncers on
hand.

Diana Bellisario, owner of Mellinger’s
Beer Distributor, plans to run her store
this weekend the same way she does every
weekend — except she will double the
order of beer. When the Steelers were in
the Super Bowl in 2009, Bellisario said she
sold more beer compared to_a Super Bowl
without the Steelers. Her store must close _
by 5 p.m. on Sunday by law, but that will
give her time to watch the game.

And will she be rooting for the Steel-
ers? a

“You know it,” she said.

It’s generally understood here on cam-
pus that fried food pairs well with beer,
too, and Quaker Steak -and Lube will be
dishing up buckets of chicken wings -
lots of buckets.

The restaurant’s Super Bowl weekend
delivery will contain 60 cases of wings,
said Tony Work, Quaker Steak and Lube’s
manager. Each case contains 40 pounds of
wings — that’s 2,400 pounds of chicken,
or more than triple a_. standard delivery,

. Work said. 9 '

The "restaurant began taking orders
for the big day two weeks in advance. It
recently changed its message machine to
remind customers to hurry up and preor-

~ der their wings for Super Bowl Sunday. ‘

Police, experts discuss student celebration rights

Philip Bombara
Staﬁ Writer

This year, Pitt and city police are trying to
avoid the chaos that occurred after the last
Steelers Super Bowl victory, but students
can take a few steps to keep themselves out
of harm’s way as well. 9 _

As stated in advertisements and e—mails
to be sent to the student body, there will be

a designatedarea oﬂcelebrationin anticipa.- s

tion of a Super Bowl victory. The last time
thee‘-gsteelers won the» game, masses of people
crowded Forbes Avenue and Bigél'5_w Boule-

vard. Over the course of more than an hour, .



windows were broken, bus shelters leveled,
cars ﬂipped and ﬁres lit. Initial estimates put
the damage at more than $100,000.
This year, the University wants to avoid
that. r '
, “Bigelow Boulevard between the.William‘
Pitt Union and Cathedral of Learning will be

closed, the post-game victory celebration ,

will be limited to this area for one hour after
the game,” Pitt spokeswoman Patricia White
said in an e—mail. -

..University of Pittsburgh Police Chief
Tim"Delaney said in a phone"interview that '
becausebf the damage caused in the past,:

' it was important’ to have a plan in place for

this year. » .. ., 

.1 .3 ii‘: a . we
.4».

“In the past, everyone comes running
out cheering, looks around and goes now
what?” Delaney said. - ' , .

Pitt oﬂicials want to prevent this from
happening by having a speciﬁed area where
the celebration can take place. Delaney said
Pitt police have always unofficially given such

celebrations about one hour to take‘ place

before becoming very involved.

“We are understanding of people wanting

to celebrate and have a good time,” Delaney

said. _ y ‘ A A ,
Pitt law professorjohn Burkoffsaid-that

the main precautions students shouldtake

are pretty obvious, _and apply to most other

situations. J .

“Any type of property destruction, light-
ing ﬁres; any" things that create danger to
others are way out of bounds,” Burkoff
said. 9 .

' He said that shutting down Bigelow Bou-
levard shows a level of understanding and
tolerance that a celebration is in order for ,
a victory. . ,

“It seems to methat it is their intention
to give people room to celebrate, but make
sure that it is-responsible,” Burkofl’ said. ,

Delaney expressed a similar sentiment.

“We wantto make sure that students have
their room to celebrate, but do it responsibly
and" in a situationthat can be controlledif

V needbe,” Delaney said.

Revelers take to Facebook

Shae’ Felicien
Staff Writer

With the big game still two days away, Pitt
has already seen the rise and fall of several
Facebook events presenting opposing ideas
of how to celebrate a Steelers victory.

Pitt juniorjames Lomuscio created_Pitt
Students For Reasonable Super Bowl Celebra-
tion just minutes after the Steelers won the
AFC Championship almost two weeks ago.
His event represents one camp of fans who
hope to minimize any destruction and danger
following the game.

Other groups with differing opinions have
cropped up, starting a dialogue about how wild
fans should be when expressing post-game
emotion. I . ' .

“My hope is that this event makes it Widely
known that those who choose to destroy (like
say, abusshelter, or Hillman Library windows)
win no praise from any of us,” Lomuscio said
in a Facebook message to all group members
earlier this week. “This is a small effort to be
sure, but much of what happened in February
2009 was because of an expectation of lawless-
ness, of chaos and of zero accountability.”

After witnessing the riots of 2009 and see-
ing groups of students lighting objects on ﬁre
and smashing parkinglmeters, Lomuscio felt
the need to create this kind of group.

“I think it’s important that people who may A

be inclined to riot and destroy things  recog-
nize that there are many students who in no
way support what they do,” Lomuscio said.

Lomuscio speculated that “it’s the ano-
nymity in a mob that allows for these sorts
of behavior.” .

“The same thing happened with the G-20
[Summit] ,’7 he said. .

So far the Reasonable Super Bowl Celebra- '

tion group has amassed nearly 1,500 mem-
bers, yet not all posts on the group’s wall were
supportive of the initiative. .

“Nice try  but it’s a lost cause bro. Di
you really think this was going to work?” Rob
Siravo asked in a post onjan. 27.

Others shared similar sentiments.

“The Riots Will Continue!” Ralphjohnson,
a freshman, posted last Tuesday.

“As young students at a large university, I
feel as if a large, chaotic celebration is immi-
nent. A lot of kids are going to be engaged in
drinking and out of the excitement, it’s deﬁ-
nitely not out of line to say people are going to
be going crazy,”_]ohnson predicted.

Other people advocated Dumpster ﬁres»

on Forbes Avenue, climbing traﬁic lights and
burning couches.

Soon after Lomuscio’s group was cre-
ated, Ryan Snowden, a former Pitt student
who now attends Robert Morris University,
created Pittsburgh’s Appropriate Super Bowl
Celebration as a response.

The group’s proﬁle picture, which depicted
the darkened image of a man raising his hands
high in the air while aﬁre blazed behind him,
seems to highlight the ideological differences
between the groups.

Yet, students who advocated for rowdy
behavior online differed in their actual cel-
ebration plans. ‘ ,

Freshman Steve Danielson posted that

0 “There’s probably not even going to be any

riots or anything, but people will be drunk
and celebrating obnoxiously.” - '

With the amount of increased attention
that the groups received on Facebook, the
University even employed the use of groups
to spread awareness of the potential conse-
quences of ‘criminal behavior. V

Deborah Walker, student conduct ofﬁcer,

made a post on the Reasonable Celebration A

wall.

“While the University of Pittsburgh‘ and
the Division of Student Affairs understand
your wanting to celebrate the Steelers vic-
tory in the Super bowl, you should be aware
of the consequences of being involved with
any unlawful, destructive behavior that leads
to violations against the Student Code of Con-
duct,” she warned. _

Walker added that University students who
are cited by the city or Pitt policewill be subject
to sanctions that may include ﬁnes, damage
restitution, disciplinary probation and disci-
plinary suspension. ' V

A few days after this post was made,
Snowden changed the proﬁle picture of his

~ group to Steelers coach Mike Tomlin and

altered the message of his group to “Please
celebrate responsibly” before deleting the
group entirely on Wednesday night. Snowden
declined further comment.

The event had accumulated 1,300 attend-
ees before its deletion. _

Last Tuesday, Student Affairs released the
ﬁrst of its two Celebrate Responsibly You'I‘ube
videos, which-depict various student leaders
on campus encouraging safe celebration and
alerting students of ‘what constitutes viola-
tions.

“Violations include arson, setting or ﬁle]-
ing a ﬁre of any kind, criminal mischief aka
property damage, alcohol violations including
underage drinking, open containers or public
drunkenness and failure topdisperse, failure
to obey ofﬁcers’ commands to leave or go to
a speciﬁc area,” said the student leaders in
both videos. I

EDITORIAL

CASUAL
FRIDAYS  

Congratulations! By reading your way to this editorial you’ve suc-
cessfully numbered yourselfamong the small cadre of Pitt students
who devote their Fridays to intellectual activities and the following
of the news! And as part of your exclusive reading experience, you’re ,
about to receive our highly obsessed-over, socially obligated and
functionally counterproductive message of Super Bowl caution.
Ah, never mind. Overthe past week you’ve already received
enough of that, and pitted against those of the University ad— .

T ministration, any Pitt, News message would likely be forgotten

anyway for glaring deﬁciencies in green—screen technology.
Instead of telling you what not to do on Sunday night, we’ve
compiled a list of alternative post-game activities, ways you can
channel your “Yinzer” jubilation —— or rage, depending on the
Super Bowl outcome ~ that are totally legal and Nordy-friendly.
And though you won’t ﬁnd havoc creation or municipal destruc-
tion on the list, we think you’ll ﬁnd our ideas at least or almost
as fun.

What The Pitt News suggests you do Sunday
night:

1. Instead of breaking windows, break bread
with friends!

2 . Insteadlof climbing poles, climb the hill to up-
per campus!

3. Instead of ﬂipping cars, ﬂip cups (if you’re old
enough)!

I

4. Instead of screaming and shouting, TWEET
IN ALL CAPS! —

5 . Instead of leveling bus stations, level polite
admonishments toward Packers fans. Instead of

setting ﬁre to Dumpsters, spark a ﬂame in your
love life! _

7. Instead of blocking trafﬁc, block partiers from
leaving your apartment —— with chocolate, per-
haps! ' -

8. Instead of failing to disperse, disperse failure
from your studies! - ‘

9. Instead of spraying grafﬁti, spray air fresh-
ener in your roommate’s bathroom — it needs it!

IAO. Instead of moving property, move your . '.
friends with impromptu poetry!

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

I am responding to the recent array of articles regarding a possiblealcohol amnesty policy at Pitt.
If only two students in the past two years have been given underage citations while seeking" medi-
cal attention, what is the huge problem? Why are we seeking to use a policy to bailout underagers
who knowingly and willingly break the law? Yes, we all have drunk under age. It’s a risk we take,
and a decision we made ourselves. Perhaps the writers of these articles should encourage personal,
individual responsibility for once instead. '

My name is Caitlyn — that’s spelled C—A—I-
T-L—Y-N. I’m 20 years old, and from a town

* called Leesburg, Va. My life is perfect except
’ for one thing: I’m addicted to TV documen-

taries;

If you’ve ever watched A&E’s show “In—
tervention,” you’ll get what I’m alluding to
in my opening up there. But my problem
doesn’t stop with watching people confront
theiralcoholism and methamphetamine ad-
dictions. Nay, nay. Recently, in self—imposed
conﬁnement from the snow, I expanded my
repertoire to include “Hoarders” and the

National Geographic prison documentary I

simple as saying “I watch alcoholics rather
than being an alcoholic myself,” or any-
thing like that. Just like any other show, the
documentaries have familiar patterns that
Ienjoy falling into. On “Intervention,” for
instance, the plot is pretty much the same
every episode — probably-as redundant as

an episode of “Full House.” The addicts are

introduced; the camera follows them around
as they get their ﬁx; there’s a back story that
clues us in to their childhoods and makes
us feel as though we know them intimately.
Then there is the intervention, and even that
is sometimes highly redundant; one of the‘
interventionists uses the exact same line with
every confrontation. The addict usually takes

itreatmentand the camera follows him into

the rehabilitation center with the same song
in the backgrourid every time. In the ﬁnal

“Lockdown.” If it’s dirty, if it’s gritty, if it '

presents an alternate, extreme version of
my reality, I’ll watch it.

Ordinarily, I’m nota big fan of the tube. I
don’t have the attention span to tune into a
show on a weekly basis, and I don’t have any
patience for so—called “reality TV” that is ob-

, viously manipulated for shock value. Rather

than the “Oh, it’s 8 p.m. on a Wednesday —
time to put on NBC” mentality behind other
serials, which you have to watch in a certain
order, the documentaries can be watched in

haphazardly, any time I’m craving a roller ‘

coaster of emotions. A hoarder who compul-

sively stores rotten food? I’ll skip to ‘season ,

two for that! A meth head who thinks she’s

Jesus’ sister? Hello, “Intervention” season.

two, episode 18. -
After my documentary binge, even when
I wasn’t watching the shows, I was probably
talking about them. Igot to thinking about
the appeal of reality TV: Rather than actu-

ally going to prison, or drinking a gallon of ‘

vodka every day, do I want to experience it
vicariously on screen?

In “Going Bowling,” a 2000 episode of
NPR’s “All Things Considered,” Harvard pro-
fessor Robert Putnam explained the effect
of TV on human connection in American
society, saying, “The more entertainment
television you watch, the less critically en-
gaged you are. People watch ‘Friends’ rather
than having friends.”

I don’t think my attraction to TV docu-

mentaries about addiction and crime is as

moments there is a minor epilogue, either
detailing the addict’s successes or failures.
There’s also the Schadenfreude effect,
whereby people supposedly take pleasure
in someone else’s suﬁering. Undeniably,

‘human distress is the main character in ev-

ery episode of “Lockdown,” “Intervention”
and “Hoarders.” Fortunately, as a woman,
I might be exempt from coming across as a
sadist. According to a report in The New York
Times, empathy circuits light up in women
when we observe bad things happening to
good people and bad things happening to bad
people. Maybe I’m just covering my tracks
here — I mean, if I cared that much I would
probably turn off the show, right?
Empathetic or not, I think the main ap-
peal of the documentaries is the pleasure
derived, not just from suffering, but from
learning about the “lowest rungs” of soci-
ety — and the way operations proceed in
different social settings. I’m fascinated with
“Lockdown” not only for the characters, but
also because some part of me is really inter-
ested in a prison’s social order. I’ll never need
to carve a shank out of a toothbrush, but I
know how to. My interest in “Intervention”
and “Hoarders” is harder to put my ﬁnger on;

maybe it does come down to Schadenfreude ,

after all; What I do know is, when I loginto
my Netﬂix account, what I see will offer me
some element of escapism — even if that
involves escaping into a darker place.

Kayla Sweeney
Staff Writer

Many people this weekend will be betting ‘

substantial amounts of cash on who 
Super Bowl XLV. But for two art museums, the
winner’s prize won’t be money —— it will be a
painting.

The Carnegie Museum of Art is holding
a bet with the Milwaukee Art Museum over
whose football team will win the Super Bowl
this Sunday 4 the Steelers or the Packers. The
losing region’s art museum will temporarily
loan a coveted piece of artwork to the winning
region’s museum.

If the Steelers win on Sunday, the Carnegie
Museum of Art will receive a much—desired
painting to complete their impressionist col-
lection: “Boating on the Yerres” by Gustave
Caillebotte. The artist is aFrench painter from
the late 19th century whose work is rare, and
despite the fact that the Carnegie Museum of
Art has an extensive collection of impression-
ist paintings, they do not have any paintings
by Caillebotte. - .

“He’s very desirable to us,” the Carnegie
Museum of Art’s representative Ellen James
said.

If Wisconsin’s Green Bay Packers win the
title, on the other hand, the.Milwaukee Art
Museum will receive the Carnegie’s “Bathers

=3!

 

 

with Cra ” by Pierre—Auguste Renoir.

Each museum presented to the other a list
of three paintings they were willing to part
with for the bet. The other museum then se-
lected one of the three paintings to become
its tentative prize. . ’

James clariﬁed, that “we’re not betting on
ownership of a work of art.” .

Instead, the paintings are going to be loaned
for, as of press time, an undetermined period.
As of yet, the Carnegie does not have any spe-

ciﬁc plans for the placement or presentation,
of their prize, although James reassuresthe

people of Pittsburgh and Milwaukee alike,
“We’re pretty sure we’re going to be the ones
thatwinit.” «

But this bet is about more than adding an-
other painting, albeit temporarily, to one of the
museums’ collections.

“Itwill let people know that the art museum
is very much involved in the city, that we’re not
just abunch of stuffy’ old shirts,”James said. “It’s
a great way to bridge two interests that people
may not also associate with each other.” V

It might be true that people today generally
do not associate art and sports, but according
to Pitt art-history professor Anne Weis, this
was not always the case.

“Through most of the history of the world,
the art world and the sports world have been
very much in sync,” Weis said, pointing to the
myriad paintings of race horses, rowers and

fore. J
Gretcheri Bender, a Pitt art-history lecturer,

is quickto agree with this statement, although '

she additionally thinks tl1ere’s apossibility the
artworld could, in fact, be inspired by modem-
day sports. V .

“If there is fbeauty’ in the milky presence
of Monet’s paint strokes on the surface of the
canvas  then could there also be ‘beauty’ in the
arching reach of player, ﬂying weightless above
the ground, as he strives to catch the 30-yard
pass in the red zone while landing lightly with

, both toes in bounds?” Bender asked.

The way sports are run today could be the
reason for the apparent schism between the
two industries, according to Weis.

“With less ‘heroism’ in sports as a public
institution than in earlier decades and centu-
ries, artists have focused on other long-term
social interests  like social commentary and
 the environment,” Weis said. In her opinion,
scandals, steroids and money seem to be the
main reasons artists have shied away from the
sports arena. ‘

- Either way, this Super Bowl bet has the po— I

tential to make sports fan more aware of the
artworld, and vice versa. As Bender said, both
sports and art remain “vibrant and powerful
means ofhuman expression.” This Super Bowl
bet is merely an attempt at reuniting them. .

as Rebecca, a deranged college freshman who
develops an unhealthy obsession with her
roommate, Sara (Minka Kelly). Rebecca, who
has a history of mental disorder, seems nor-
mal at ﬁrst, but soon regresses into insanity
and becomes a danger to those around her.
The role is a big departure for Meester,
who is a series regular on the hit show “Gossip
Girl.” Nevertheless, Meester, who also stars
in “Country Strong,” said she was up for the
challenge. In a conference call with several
college publications, Meester discussed her
role and the difficulties it presented.
Question: What kind of an impact did play-
ing Rebecca have on you?
Leighton Meester: I can’t say it wasn’t fun
— it was — but it was also intense, I think
for everyone... [To] try to share something
in common with her or try to understand

 

in gross detail different cases they worked
on defending.

Q: What would you be looking for in the
perfect roommate?

LM: I actually love living alone. I used to
have roommates all the time and it’s a chal-
lenge to live with people. Someone who’s clean
I guess. I lived with all different roommates
and there was always parties going on when-
ever I came home and you’re sort of expected
to socialize all the time, even when you don’t
want to. For the most part I was pretty lucky,
butl have had some not-so-good experiences
with female roommates who eat all your food
and take all your clothes.

Q: How was this role similar and/or differ-
ent from your role as Blair on “Gossip Girl”?

LM:.It couldn’t have been more different.
The character, she is from a different place,
she has a different background [and] differ-
ent parents. Rebecca has a history of having
mental disorder. It’s not at all the same as what
I play day to day on my show, [it’s] a pleasure
to break from that and do something different,
but it’s also so incredibly different from who
I am as a person. I

FOOTBALL

Super Bowl features comparable teams

J Greg~Tr_ietley
Senior Staff Writer

The two teams are so similar, it’s eerie. J

On Wednesday, the Sporting News called
them “mirror images.” Steelers linebacker
James Farrior admitted Monday that both
teams “run ‘pretty much the same defense.”
The AP noted that both teams drafted 16 of
their expected starters, signed two more after
they went undrafted and added the last four via
free agency. They resemble each other even
down to the blitz packages they use.

But ask Steelers or Packers fans what they

: think about the opposition, and their responses

will make it sound like the two teams couldn’t
be any more different. This Sunday night,
they’re rivals, competing against each other
for football’s greatest prize in Super Bowl XLV
at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas.

The Pittsburgh Steelers franchise seeks its
seventh Super Bowl win on Sunday, with its
sixth coming just two years ago against the
Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII. Green
Bay, another historic NFL franchise, is going
for its fourth. -

“You’ve got two storied franchises,” Steelers

’- quarterback Ben Roethlisberger said Monday.

“It’s goingto be crazybecause the whole_place

is going to be yellow because of both teams.” -
Roethlisberger, who won championships _

with'Pittsburgh in 2006 and 2009, could be-
come the ﬁfth quarterback in history to win
three Super Bowls with one team.

Green Bay has a star quarterback of its
own in Aaron Rodgers, who has thrown for
six touchdowns in the postseason and rushed
for two more. He led the Packers out of the
NFC as a No. 6 seed with three roadwins over
division-winners Philadelphia, Atlanta and

’ Chicago. ’

Both quarterbacks have plenty of targets to
which they can throw. Each team has a speed-
ster — Pittsburgh’s Mike Wallace and his 21-
yard receiving average counter Green Bay’s
Gregjennings and his 12 touchdowns —- and

 each has aveteran complement. Donald Driver

has played all 12, of his years in the league with
the Packers, axfd Sunday will conclude Hines
Ward’s 13th season with the Steelers.
“[Drive'r has] really been a mentor to the
younger receivers,” Green Bay head coach Mike
McCarthy said Tuesday. “Donald has been a

" Packer through and through as far as how he

handles his business. He is the one that has the
notebook out. He highlights every play just like
it’s the ﬁrst time it’s ever put in.” _

Ward’s situation has drawn comparisons
tojerome Bettis’ Super Bowl XL win and sub-

1- sequent retirement, but the 34-year-old said

Monday he hasn’t thought-‘about hanging up
his cleats for good. , V
“I knowjerome went out on top,” Ward said.

to match up perfectly, it’s only ﬁtting. I

“I feel good. Whenever that time comes, trust
me, I’ll let you guys know. I don’t foresee this
being my last game.” I

It was Ward’s teammate Rashard Mend-
enhall who catapulted Pittsburgh to the Su-
per Bowl. In the AFC divisional playoff game
against Baltimore, Mendenhall capped the
winning drive with a 2-yard touchdown run
with 1:33 left to play, and the Steelers won in
come-from—behind fashion, 31-24.

Sunday, though, Mendenhall faces the
league’s second-best rush defense, one with

nose tackle B.J. Raji at the helm. Raji’s 18-yard

interception return for a touchdown was in-
strumental in Green Bay’s win two weeks ago
over Chicago, 21-14, to reach the Super Bowl.

The only team better than the Packers
against the run is Pittsburgh itself. Green Bay
rookie running back James Starks will go up
against a defense that has given up just ﬁve
rushing touchdowns all season.

N 0 player has rushed for 100 yards against
the Steelers this year. ;

Gaining yardsithrough the air could prove
difﬁcultforboth teams too. Green Bay lineback-
er Clay Matthews has the speed and strength to
rush Roethlisberger on some plays and cover
receivers on others.

“Clay is  in an elite group of being one of
the best pass rusher/outside linebackers -—
let alone defensive players -— in the National
Football League,” McCarthy said. “He brings a
tremendous energy, style of play, tenaciousness
to our defense that is infectious.”

The Steelers’ version of Matthews is Troy
Polamalu, who edged out Matthews by two
votes this week for the AP’s Defensive Player

’ of the Year award. Polamalu, James Harrison

and Pittsburgh’s strong front seven racked up

a league-best 48 sacks during the season.
“We always have competition between [me

and Harrison] ,” linebacker LaMarr Woodley

said Monday. ”We just always talk and say,

-‘Who’s going to get to the quarterback f1rst?”’

Pittsburgh, defensive coordinator Dick Le-
Beau and Green Bay defensive coordinator
Dom Capers both employ the zone blitz against
the passing attack. In fact, they invented the
scheme together with Bill Cowher in 1994 when
all three worked for the Steelers.

The coaching connecﬁons don’t stop there.
McCarthy grew up and still lives in the Pitts-
burgh neighborhood of Greenﬁeld. Residing
15 minutes away from Downtown, he was a
Steelers fan as‘a child. . if

“I remember all of the Super Bowls,” he said.
“The biggest thing I remember about the ﬁrst ,
Super Bowl was the city’s reaction to it. It had
been 40 years and Mr. [Dan] Rooney — what
he meant to the city and for the city to have that ,
success. I was a Steelers fan, andjack Lambert
was my favorite player.” '

The Backyard Brawl usually evokes images of
the Pitt Panthers taking the gridiron against the

West Virginia Mountaineers, but Friday night,

the rivalrywill move to the mats for awrestling
match being promoted by the athletic depart-

ment as “Fill the Fitz.”  Z ' . = .

Fans -are encouraged to wear navyiéblue in
hopes ofa “blue out” for thejI_7 p.m. match at
the FitzgeraldField House. B 

Pitt marketing and promotions assistant
Sean Callahan-Dinish said “Fill the Fitz” is a
student—focused promotion.

“We’re going to be having free rally towels

for the ﬁrst 300. people, OCC credit and a free

burrito toss,” he said.
Callahan-Dinish expects the best turnout
of the season. ' _
“We’re looking at probably 900 to 1,000
people at least,” he said. “We have the band com-

organizations committed to be there.”
Callahan-Dinish said the turnout for home
matches is usually around 450 people. 4
Panthers assistant coach Jason Peters be-
lieves that the promotion and attendance could
create an exciting atmosphere for the match.
“It’s always good to get a lot of fan support,”
Peters said. “You know, we’ve wrestled in front
of more people in the past, but it should be
exciting to get a good crowd behind the team
for the mate .” » ' -
He added that no matter what the sport, an
event featuring Pitt against West Virginia gets
people excited. ‘

“We’ll try not to look too much into the I

rivalry and let the results speak for us, but it
should be exciting,” he said. —

The No. 23 Panthers (9-6, 2-0 EWL) areﬁght-

I Wrestling 4 8

Pitt leads the all-time series with West Vir-
ginia 31-22-2. ’

Last season, the Panthers walked out of Mor-
gantown with a 19 -15'victory. The matchup was
split with ﬁve victories for. each team. Bonus
points earned on a fall bynow-redshirt junior
Tyler Nauman and a major decision by junior
Zac Thomusseit proved the deciding factor.

The Mountaineers lineup is stacked at the
lower weights with Shane Young wrestling at

' 125 pounds and Nathan Pennesi at 133 pounds.

Young, favored to win the EWL individual title

I tliisliyear, is currently 23-6. He should have a

tough rematch with sophomore Anthony Zanet-

‘ta. Zanetta defeated Young 5-4 last seasoninthe

dual meet and 4-2 at the EWL tournament.
. u gpfﬁzanetta has beaten [Young] twice in col-
lege?’Pet‘ers said. “Young is a great competitor,

‘ but we  that Zanetta can win again.”

_* ‘ After last‘weekend’s_ match with Blooms-

burg, Zanettaislookingforward to the matchup I

with WVU. I

“Anytime youwrestle West Virginia it’s going
to be fun,” Zanetta said; “It’s going to be a great
crowd and a great time. You get pumped up
for those types of matches. I think that’s when
everyone wrestles their best.”

At 133 Pounds, Pennesi is a redshirt fresh-
man and is currently the top-ranked wrestler

A r for WVU according to lnterMat, coming in at
No._ 15. Freshman Shelton Mack, who picked up 4

a big 6-4 victory last Sunday against Blooms-
burg, will face Pennesi.

“Shelton Mack has wrestled tough this sea-
son,” Peters said. “He’s already beaten some

guys he wasn’t expected to beat, so we’ll see

what he can do.”
' Another member of the Mountaineers

' lineup to watch for is redshirt senior Brandon

Rader,-wrestling" at 149 pounds. Rader was an

at the Fitzgerald Field House.

All-Americanin20o6 and 2007 before injuries
kept him out of the lineup. Rader has retumed
for his ﬁnal year of eligibility and could give
sophomore Danejohnson a tough match.

The Panthers enter Friday night with four
wrestlers ranked in the top 20.

I Redshirt senior Ryan Tomei is ranked No. 7
at heavyweight after winninghis 100th career
match on Sunday. Tomei is currently 21-4 on
the season. ' _ _

I At 141 pounds, Nauman comes in at No. 7.
Nauman also reached the 1oo—win milestone
recently and» is currently 17-3 on the year.

Zac Thomusseit is No. 8 at .197 pounds.
Thomusseit has been sidelined as of late with

an unspeciﬁed injury. IfThomusseit returns,’ he '

will be a huge addition to the Panthers lineup.
Freshman Max Thomusseit comes in at No.

so  in his rookie campaign. I .  I’

'   has done a remarkable job,” Pitt head

  

-coach Rande Stottlemyer said after the win

against Bloomsburg. “He has worked hard and
has really put himselfinto a good position.”

Peters agreed with Stottlemyer on the
younger Thomus_seit’s outlook so far.

“Max has wrestled really tough for us this
season,” Peters said. “We really hope his work
pays off and that atthe end of the season hewill
be a true freshman All-American.”

This matchup could very wellbe atight one,
with major implications for the EWL champion-

ship. Every bout is a must-win for both sides,’

and any bonus points earned could turn the
tide in either direction.

“Obviously we hope we can get a sixth or
seventh win,” Peters said. “But West Virginiahas
a good team, and it could come down to a 5-5
split with bonus points making a difference”;
