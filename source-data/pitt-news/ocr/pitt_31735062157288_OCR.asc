When Pittis Varsity Marching Band stfutted onto the ﬁeld

ed more easily.

There were other men in the stadium who helped, too,
like Ben E. Benack, assistant director; drill coach John Rey-

13 through 18, 13 hours of prac-
tice daily‘ was the rule.

So that they‘ wouldn’t be “in p

the dark” for night practice, spe-
cial batteries of lights were erect-
ed on both sides of the marching
-ﬁeld. A public address system was
installed, observation towers - on
the hills were built to watch rou-
Atines. and a-rehearsal hall was put
‘up for indoor practice.

“It was a real grind,”~ says Jack
Greenberg. “At 11:30 p.m. (cur-
few hour), the boys hit the sack
and really slept; brother, they
were so beat they couldn’t help
it.”

But it wasn’t all work and no
play at band camp. As in former.
years, a tradition was followed
that literally leaves director Ar-
thur “cold.” Early one morning,

' with the band standing at starch-

0

edyattention, “Reveille” was play-
ed, while the ﬂag was raised. In
this case, the “ﬂag” was Mr. Ar-
thur’s pajamas '

' Maneuvers New

New routines wereperfected at
camp‘ which I were seen for the
first time last Saturday. The band’s
pre-game entrance, called a com-
pany-front maneuver, is different
from last year’s.

Divided into two lines, band
members march ontothe ﬁeld to

The panther head is formed, fol-
lowed by the “Alma Mater.”
“This "lets the announcer take ad-
vantage of the silence that usually
follows the ‘Alma Mater,” ex-

‘ plains Mr. Arthur. “It enables him
to be heard during the rest of the
show.”

Last week’s half-time show was
based on a “Dragnet” theme. How-
ever, it was not a steal from the
TV and record parodies, since the
routine was conceived and design-
ed last'February.- '

Tricky steps were the big fea-
ture in the show. First, the band
formed itself into a gun, and vghile

Homecoming ‘

Date Is Oct. 10  

More than 1,000 University of
Pittsburgh alumni will return to

the campus the weekend of Oct.
10 for homecoming events.

Highlight of the weekend ac-
tivities will be the Pitt-Nebraska
game at the stadium. A Home-
coming luncheon at the Hotel
Schenley will precede the game.
New kick-off time is‘ 1:30 p.m. and
busses will transport alumni ‘from
the luncheon to the stadium.‘

During half-time Pitt band
alumni will join the varsity band
‘for a’ special show. Following the
game they will meet for a reunion
dinner at the Webster Hall Ho-
tel at 5 p.m. The late Jock Suth-
er1and’s selection for the Football
Hall of Fame will also be featured
at half-time.

Other events scheduled for the
weekend include a Business Ad-

fairs are scheduled for Friday
night at the Hotel" Schenley, the
smoker at 9 p.m. and the dinner

cans will be present for the din-
ner.

 

The routine will feature such
songs as “Join the Navy,”“‘Bell
Bottom Trousers,” “Sailor’s Horn-
pipe,” (all these with appropriate
steps), and ﬁnally the Navy Hymn
and Anchors Aweigh, directed by
Lt. Cmdr. ‘Robert L. Arthur, USNR.
Fast Step Tough on Men

The band’s famous high, fast
step is its own style. »Members try
for a waist-high step, especially in
the “grandioso,” the slow step
which accompanies the end of the
entrance routine at football -games.
Cadence, which. varies according
to the music, is from 160 to 180
steps per minute. “The peace real-
ly ‘clobbers’ the men,” muses Jack

Biochemistry

Gets New Head

A “renaissance in biochemi-
cal research at Pitt” has been
foreseen by the newly’ named
chairman of the reorganized

department of biochemistry‘

i_n the Medical School. Dr.
Klaus Hofmann, professor of
biochemistry at the Universi-
ty since 1952 and faculty member

' since 1944, has just been appoint-

ed to the new position.

Dr. Hofman, who believes that
biochemistry is one of the" most
active and steadily ‘ growing of
the medical science ﬁelds, has out-
lined three objectives of the new
department. He. supports the in-
tegration of the course in bio-
chemistry given ﬁrst,-year medi-
cal students more closely with the
other basic medical science de-
partments and the medical cur-
riculum as a whole.

He is working on the develop-
ment of a program leading to a
doctor of philosophy degree in

of a strong fundamental research
program.

. The new chairman received the
doctor of science degree from the
Federal Institute of Technology in
Zurich, Switzerland, and came to
this .t:ountry in 1938 on a Rocke-
fellér Fellowship.

He, studied for two years at the
Rockefeller Institute for Medical
Research in New York. He later
collaborated with Dr. Vincent du
Vigneaudat Cornell Medical Col-
lege on the isolation and proof of
the structure of biotin, a B-com-

plex vitamin.

Members , Trade Ideas,

Customs, Have Fun Too
' By ELINORE STONE
In the internationally-minded world in which we live

today, Americans should be aware of the habits and cus-
toms of the peoples of other nations, .

Toward fulﬁlling this goal, Pitt students havea great.

advantage. They can learn about many nationalities right

A
V

at their own doorstep.

Twice every month, a well-or-
ganized group called the Pitt In-
ternational Relations Club of
Pittsburgh, little known to the av-
erage Pitt student, meets to “pro-
mote international contact and un-
derstanding.” It does so through
both serious study and closely-
shared fun.

On the serious side, the men?-
bers study international affairs,
I ‘ .
sponsors lectures, shows slides and
movies. . '

Social Events Too,

On the lighter side, are parties

and other social events, especially

.enjoyable because of the com-

posite of young people present,
each in his or her way contribut-
ing a bit of another’ way of life
through the _talk and entertain-
ment and humor of the meeting.
One misconception that has long
surrounded the International Club
is. the belief that only foreign stu-
dents may become members. Act-
ually-, the club is for the American
every bit as much as for the for-

-eign.

International Officers

The officers themselves reﬂect
the group’s international air. Alex

de Poutiloif, a French student and,

a graduate in the school of engi-
neering, is the president. G. San-
jiva Kamath, of Indian birth and
an undergraduate, is the club’s
vice-president. Another French
native, Colette Gross, in the col-
lege, is corresponding secretary.
Committee "members _are Anoop
Krishen, also of India, and Jean'-
nine Carpenter, American. ’ ‘

Dr. Gray Advises
Dr. ‘Peter Gray, head of the de-
partment- of biological sciences,

has been advising the group for 4

three years. —

This Friday, at 8:00 p.m. in the
YWCA on South Dithridge St.,
the International Club. will hold
another meeting. All students are
welcome to attend all meetings
for a fee of only $1.50 per semes-
ter, including refreshments after_

each meeting. There you have it.-

Food too.

 A thank you on behalf of the football team, the athletic de-

partment, Interfraternity Council, and Student Congress,
the latter two being the groups which sponsored the affair.

 

By Jim Bender .

That man was so right when he said “gone are
the days,” and "friend these days are gone‘ in more
ways than one.

There was a time (way back in my freshman
days) when a pep rally was an expression of stu-
dent spirit. . ’

Students would flock to Soldiers and Sailors,
sing a‘-few‘ songs,°give, a few ' 
cheers, and return to the prob- ,_
lems of freshman English for the .'
next hour. . -

Shed your‘ last tear for the

old days-—-they’re‘ all past. , It
seems this coming Friday there
-is a pep rally, but it’s ‘going to
be executed with military pre-
_cision. There will be no drifters,
no cynics—everybody goes! '

The Varsity Marching Band is scheduled to
march through the‘ Cathedral ﬁrst to start theifestiv-

 

A ities. Now don’t get me wrong. I can accept change
as well as the next fellow, but this band marching ‘

‘business is going to raise some mighty tricky prob-
lems. p _ . . ‘
Revolving Band? ‘I ‘  , . A . ' ,

_ How is the band going tokeep in step if they
come through the revolving doors, or if they man-
age that how will they work it. on the elevators?“
Will there only be nine trombone players onyone
elevator while another elevator carries ﬁfteen clari-
net players? ’

Will one operator snare. seven drums or will
students race up the stairs to beat the band? These
are minor points to the organizers of the rally, but
to the common man these problems assume major
proportions, and we common men would like an
answer. ’ _f _

It isn’t enough that we must have music: where

“_They” in this case means Paul Petro, ,Stu'den;t ‘V
Congress assemblies chairman, who announced a
plan to picket the Tuck Shops and cafeteria.
Egad! Unionism! ' .
/This amounts to unionism, Mr. Petro, and every
loyal fan of Westbrook Pegler will be up in arms.

ers should be, too. The day is not far off untilpthe 

students are so" ﬁrmly organized they will refuse

to work more than a speciﬁed number of.“ hours i ,

during the year at pep rallies.

Congratulations are also in order for-the magniﬁcent turn-

' out that _’ greeted the many people who prayed for 500 stu-

dents, -hoped for 300 participants, and" expected 150‘ pegple
to attend the dance and start the football season. Faculty
members and student leaders alike were amazed at the
spirit and cooperation displayed by the students who turned
out to attend .the dance and cheer the team on to its ﬁrst
game of the season. From experiences with past rallies and

 vd’ances,‘planners of the affair were slightly less than optim-

istic_ about the chances for a successful “Kick-Off Dance”
and rally, especially since it entailed the long, arduous
climb up the hill to the Field House. When the snake—danc-
ing, cheering, singing and Mexican Hat dancing ended and
the cars roared off the hill into the Oakland area, there
were many who wondered why such an’ event should not
be typical of Pitt affairs demanding a little display of spirit
and not the exception. A - i .

i.Si'cImaI Spirit Crisis‘

The proposed pep rallyi'tfor'Friday could be the ,turn- O

ing point of Pitt school spirit. After ‘the decisive loss to
West‘Virginia and the prospect of facing Oklahoma, Ne-
braska, and_Notre, Dame on successive Saturdays, Coach
,Dawson’s' crying towel might well supplant the Compass
and Vade Mecum as standard‘ equipment’ for all students.
However, there are two factors which should be taken into

Use Students To Seek Students ;i

By John De Ninno

One fact that was very prevalent at the Stu-
‘ dent Congress “Sod-Buster” in Penn Township last
Sunday was that the members of Congress are
becoming increasingly aware of the important part

tlieyplay in public relations for the University.

As everyone knows, since they have‘ been told‘-

enough times, a school’s best or worst publicity is
displayed by its student body. As
leaders of our students, Congress’
role is proportionately greater
“than the -averagestudent. It is
also their responsibility to give .
prospective college students the ‘
college student’s viewpoint. to-
ward campus life and higher ed-
.lCalSl.OD '

Realizing this, Congress came L
-up with some excellent ideas, too ;
numerous to mention here, that they hope to put
into effect in ‘the near future. '

'l8'l-h Floor Veto ’ . .

For better or for worse, almost all of our out-
side relations must be cleared through the Regis-
trar’s ofﬁce. Therefore some of these ideas will

   

either be censored or squelchedﬂ altogether. It

' wouldiindeed proﬁt those on the l8th ﬂoor, to whom

      
 

tl_1¢ese_icl_eas__ r\n_us_t,.be submitted, to: stop and consider-

that high school students can-very easily ‘get aca_- ’
demic information concerning ‘a college from’ the
bulletins published by that school. But it is from
students attending that college that_th'ey can ‘get
thevimost accurate information concerning fr.-atsi,
sororities, dances, sports, and.extracurricular'..ac-
tivities. ’ f - - ’ _ ,

Other ﬁne plans were discussed at the initial
meeting on Sunday, and the enthusiasm shown by’
those in attendance seems to» indicate a very suc-
cessful year for Congress. ‘ .
2-'-acul'l'y Favor Plan ‘

Faculty support was also. easily forthcoming
iy those faculty and administration ofﬁcials present.
 this attitude can be maintained throughout the
"ear, -I don’t see how SC can fail. '

»The Congressmen, this year, are even .more
aware of their obligation to the student body. Each .
‘member was presented on Sunday with a copy of
“The Aims and Purposes of the University” and
asked to work with them in mind,

Being a new Student Congress they now hold the

“They’re improving, but they’re
learning the hard way,” explains
the Redhead in reference to his
inexperienced Panthers.

The h e a dm a ster’s statement
could mean the Panthers learned
a lesson in the WVU defeat and
the defense, as a result, will be
better oriented to stop the Soon-
ers’ version of the 6pened—up_ T-
formation.

Sooners Fall

At any rate, as Dawson says,
“They’ll be the fastest team we’ll
play but they won’t be as big as
the West Virginiabacks.”

Oklahoma, which has placed in

five years, also found trouble .in
the first encounter as they fell to
Notre Dame, 28-21.

As for the Blue and Gold, they
-ame out of the initial fray very
well physically, with only Gary,

ankle. In fact, Trainer "Howard
Waite expects the team to be in

for WVU.

Better Idea

Give Olson
of Starters

By PAUL HARRISQN
.Priming for their home opener against the once beaten

Covies of Geneva, Saturday, the Panther harriers ran off their ’

second time trials last Friday.
Co-captain Don DelliGatti,
the Olsonmen with a time of 23:

a Connellsville product, paced
41, which bettered Walt Starz’

recorded time of the ﬁrst trials by»10. seconds. Rapid Starz,

nevertheless, lunged across the

tape 23 seconds later to wrap

‘ up the number two spot and Dan Sommer, DelliGatti’s part-

ner captain, rounded out the ﬁrst three at 24:18.  ,
At the same time Coach Carl Olson was putting, his

boys through their paces, the

Covies of Beaver Falls were

succumbing to their arch rivals,¢
Slippery Rock, in -both teams’ ini-
tial encounter. Geneva vet George
Jackson, however, saved his squad
from a possible shutout by plac-
ing ﬁrst in the meet. Jackson
placed sixth against the Pittmen
last season when the harriers
blanked Coach Rob,er't-Park’s Ge-
neva runners 15-48.
Seventh Starter Uncertain

At present Olson feels fairly
certain of his starting lineup with
his ﬁrst six men just about sure of
berths, but a cross-country team
runs with a seventhimember and
the coach isn’t quite ready to an-
nounce that man’s name.

DelliGatti, Starz, Sommer, Bob
Cherry, Allen Gunderson' and
Shaler Township’s contribution to
the ‘squad, Ron Sallade, are the
top six. Vieing for that seventh
position are: Chuck Fritz, Chuck
Wivell, Pete Kress, Dave Freas,
and Don McC1intock.

At last reports Kress and Wivell
seem to have the inside track «on
the job, but a fast showing by the
remaining three may dissuade Ol-
son. ’

“Our Course Toughest”

Referrixzg to the Panther home
course in ,3 Schenley Park, Olson
says, “Most schools run their meets
on comparatively leve1_ terrain, but"
our cross—2.‘ountry course’ is just
that, with numerous hills and
dales that tax even the best run-
ners and make them give their ut-
most. “Actually,” continues Olson,;
“the course is one of the toughest,
if not the toughest in the country.”

While competing against Geneva
on this grueling‘ trail, the Panthers

in 17 outings. Over a three year,

Rebuilding- Punk
,MeeIs Oibsiace

By RUSS FRANKE
Sports Editor

 

 

~ There is a crazy, mixed-up situation that prevails every
fall for a few short months of whirlwind action known as

_ the football season. Noses, bottles, and parlays become broken

as integral "parts of the proceedings which, due to the com-
pactness of the schedule and the quick-thrill nature of the
game, almost monopolize the autumn sports picture.

’_ Without trying to paint an all-inclusive portrait of what
happens every Saturday in the typical stadium——such a work
would ﬁll volumes and require the wisdom of a more ex-_

_.per_ienced hand——‘we can -point out that this season has all
earmarks of becoming one of the craziest, if not the most

mixed-up, yet. _ ,
Allof which refers, of course, to the early season by-prod-
ucts derived. from the NCAA’s formula to restore iron-man
‘football, 7 .
The upsets (though some claim there is no such thing) of the
ﬁrst two weeks of the season are already history, and you seldom
read ’a football article in the newspapers that does not include state-
mentsregarding the platoon switch. It is almost trite any more.
"We at Pitt, however, should have a lot to complain about.
Contrary to the popular belief in football circles that the
. effect of the switch will balance itself out among the various
colleges, the University’s ‘grid program was effectively stunned
by the new rule. ' H - -
This season was the year that Pitt was supposed to have arrived
as a“ power, following a productive program instituted by Captain

iTomlI-Iamilton and a revived athletic policy.

'The end of last season, for instance, left Red Dawson with nine

‘ holdovers from his defensive platoon, which is one half of the battle

in itself. .
‘A two-and three"-deep backﬁeld also had shaped up, with
a number of sophomores’ ready for incorporation into shuttle
units. That’s the way Michigan State, Notre Dame, and other
’ titans had been operating for some time and had already achieved
a sound degree of success. We, on“the other hand; were just get-
ting there when the  were changed. I

Naturally, every scl_1ool’s plans -had to betirevamped; those who
werle.load_ed could more easily meet the need, and those who had
nothing to begin with had nothing to lose, in the end, ._\ .

Pitt was caught in between%tOo far advanced to resign itself
and just far enough behindrto feel the sting. An evaluation of/material,
individual by individual, W111 bear. this out.

Dawson does not Object to the new rule, though, he ‘is willing
to go along with it and make adjustments accordingly. It is merely

‘a matter of time until the adjustments start to pay off again—per-
~ haps by mid-season.

In the meantime, remember what‘ Shakespeare said about
the football, season being “a tale told by an idiot, full of sound
‘and, fury . . .”

West Virginia’s victory over

,Only Penn State and South Car-

achievement, following the win
described by one Mountie spokes-
