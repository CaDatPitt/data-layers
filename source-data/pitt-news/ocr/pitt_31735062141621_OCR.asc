Business Research Bureau

Enters 8th Year of Service

The Bureau of Business Research,
under the direction of Ralph J. Wat-

kins, is now entering into its eighth '

year of service to industry in Pitts-
burgh. Founded in the autumn of
1924, the “bureau is now recognized
by hundreds of business men through-
out the district as an authority on
economic matters. Its purpose, car-
ried out by a well—trained staff of
statisticians and economic experts, is
ﬁve-fold: to collect and record im-
portant economic facts of the’ Pitts-
burgh region, to analyze facts as to
their economic importance, to help
local business men better the conduct
of their enterprises, to help business
and civic groups with their economic
problems, and to help research prob-
lems of the School of Business Ad-
ministration, with which it is affil-
iated.

In July, 1929, the Bureau entered
into an eight-year program of re-
gional economic research, the plan
being made possible by a grant from
the Buhl Foundation, and from ap-
propriations from the University.

As a major part of this" eight-year
program, the Bureau began, in De-
cember of 1930, the publication of the
Pittsburgh Business Review, a month-
ly survey of business conditions in all
the major ﬁelds of business in this re-
gion. Dr. Watkins, in, the ﬁrst edi-
tion of the Bureau’s periodical, pre-

Concert Band

sented the following purpose that

has made the monthly respected andi
anticipated by Pittsburgh commercial!

and industrial men; “In any city of
the size and economic signiﬁcance of
Pittsburgh there should be some
agency to which the community could
look for authentic and impartial in-
formation on current economic condi-
tions. It is the purpose of this Re-
view to ﬁll this need in the Pittsburgh
district.”

Pitt YMCA Members Will
Attend Grove City Confab

Over the week-end W, W, Menden-
hall and approximately 15 members
of the Pitt YMCA will attend the
Western Pennsylvania conference for
the discussion of the YMCA problems
on the campus. Among the speakers
at the conference, to which Grove
City College will be the host, are Dr.
Ellis of Juniata College, Dr. John R.
Ewers of Pittsburgh, and George
Irving of New York City. Fourteen
schools throughout western Pennsyl-
vania have signiﬁed their intention of

at1:e_ns.i_i_n.s the _confer.en.c.e..

, discussions.

“lt’s Your Move!” I

“It’s your move, but don’t take
more than half an hour because I
have a sixth hour class.’—’- The»
lads of the Chess Club, advised
by William S. Maulsby_, head of
the department of Journalism,
are in. the throes of a Round
Robin tournament to determine

who is the best player. The club
meets each Friday at 12:30
o’clock at the Y hut. Anyone

wishing to enter into the “mental
gymnastics of superposition” is
encouraged to play with the boys
at any time.

To Be Chosen

Football Band Ends Season;
Praised Highly in Phila.

Football season ended, the Pitt
Band will assume for the remainder
of the year the aspect of a concert
band. This necessitates the reduction
of the personnel from 130 members
to 60.

The 1932 band reached a greater
height of achievement than has ever
before been experienced by that or-
ganization. Acclaim attended their
every performance, reaching its
heighth when it was compared favor-
ably with the Ohio State Band, which
is commonly known as the “best col-
lege band.” But equal-ly sweet was
the praise bestowed upon it by a
Philadelphia newspaper following the
Pitt—University of Penn football game,

The football band was taken under
the supervision of the ROTC three
years ago, and each succeeding year
has shown a marked improvement, un-
til, on the basis of this year’s show-
ing, it rightly deserves to be classed
as one of the best in the country.

As a reward
work, a picture of the entire band will
be taken Friday at 1 o’clock on the
steps of Memorial Hall. Members
will be dressed in uniform and carry
with them their instruments. This
will be the ﬁrst year that the picture.
of the entire football band has-been
taken. Hitherto only the concert
band was photographed.

Time Changed
For Classes

Seven Minute Period Made
Three Minutes Longer

The seve11-minute period between

classes has been increased to take
ten minutes, according to an an-
nouncement this morning by John
Weber, business manager of the
University. The new schedule will
become effective Monday morning.

Classes will be scheduled to start
on the half hour with a tardy bell be-
ing sound-ed ten minutes later. The
ﬁrst bell, which will be sounded on
the half hour, will announce both the
end of each hour and the beginning
of ‘the next.

The added time between classes
will enable students whose classes are
in various buildings in the campus to
get to their classes on time. Difficul-
ty had been seen in the efforts of stu-
dents who had classes in the Cathe-
dral to get to classes in Alumni,
State, and Thaw halls in time.

Rose Bowl victory on Janu-
ary 2, in the nation’s major
intersectional game, the third
in which Pitt will have par-
ticipated since the inaugura-
tion of the series in 19154.
Michigan, Colgate and Au
burn, besides . Pitt, previously
had been mentioned as possi-
ble candidates for the coast
bid. ,
Michigan, because it could not gain
the sanction of the Big Ten Confer-
ence, and Auburn, because that team
is already scheduled to play you the
coast this year, were the ﬁrst to be
eliminated from consideration for the
invitation. Although Colgate ﬁnished
its season undefeated and untied, and
its goal line uncrossed during the en-
tire fall campaign, the team’s sched-
ule weakened its argument for partic-
ipation in the Rose Bowl game, and
the bid ﬁnally was tendered to Pitt.
Fourth Visit to Coast

The Panthers have met west coast
opposition on three other occasions,
but the game in 1922 when “Glenn
Wa.rner’s University of Pittsburgh
football team defeated the'Stanfor-d
eleven 16-7,” in the days on Ander-
son, Flanagan, and Hewitt, was be-
fore the time of Rose Bowl competi-
tion.

Times and coaches had changed at
Pitt when the Panthers received their
ﬁrst Tournament invitation. That
game was not as satisfactory, as the
one four years before, for Pitt; but
it was for “Pop,”_ Whose , “Stanford
Cardinals converted the point after
touchdown to defeat the University
of Pittsburgh, 7-6, as 65,000 football
fans looked on.” And the paper fur-
ther stated that day, “the strategy of
a master was pitted against that of a
pupil, for eleven years ago, ‘Jock’
Sutherland, was a star pupil under
Warner.” Jimmy Hagan, Joe Don-
chess, and Gibby W'elch led Pitt’s at-
tack against the Indians on that
memorable New Year’s Day.

Lose to California

The result of the next invasion 

the Panthers, in 1930, of the coast,
under similar_ circumstances, was- a-
sad one. “Crashing, swirling giants’-
of the University of California who‘
asked no quarter and yielded noné,.

ripped and tore a Pittsburgh Panther‘

defense to shreds to rout the previous-

ly undefeated mythical champions of?

this year shows an improvement over
those of the same time last year. The
improvement, Dr. Tesh says, is due
to the economic conditions.

Wouid Die F or
Alma Mater.’

“The ping pong king is dead, long
live the king.” Surrounded by ac-
claiming admirers. Wilfred Barbian
smashed offtable to win the ping pong
championship of the University and
a dollar and seventy-ﬁve cents! “It
was a great ﬁght.” Barbian said as
he wiped the sweat from his fore-
head, "I did it for my Alma Mater.”

Barbian defeated "Smiling Joe”
Schmieler, fornierchamp, to claim the
victory. Even ,S_chmie1er’s experience
couldn't overcome Barbian’s dexterous
technique and matchless power.
Schmieler and Barbian, the class of
the seventeen entrants, played cool,
calculating games. Even up, at the
end of the ﬁrst two games Barbian
crashed through to take the third.

At the crucial moment, at the end
of the fourth game, Schmieler’s line
of defense wavered and broke. His
cause was lost! Interspersed through-
out the match, the comments of
“Graham MacNamaniac” Wolff, the
Regis Wolff of golf fame, threw the
opponents off-balance. Promote-r
VVoli‘f staged this battle of the century.

Prior to the championship match,
Barbian had disposed of Bob Mc-
Glurkiii, Geffner, and Mercer, while
Sclimieler was blasting the hopes of

Sideliiemer, Roll, and Wolff’s team- '
‘mate, Claude McKee.

Committee to Investigate
Eligibility for Activities

 

All women students who are carry-
ing a large activity program are urged
to check with Helen P. Rush, assist-
ant to the dean of women, as soon as
possible to ascertain whether" or not
they are complying with the rules of
the. Point Scale System.

This system regulates the number
of activities a student may carry at
one time and determines the eligibil-
ity of studentsfor offices in these ac-
tivities. The students themselves are
held responsible for a knowledge of
these regulations and for furnishing
the committee in charge with com-
plete information with regard to their
appointments or elections to student
ofﬁces.

The point scale records are on ﬁle
in office of the Dean of VVomen, In
a short time the number of activity
points carried by the women will be
investigated. Before this it is advisa-
ble that everyone on the danger-line of
overloading check with the Miss Rush_

The number of activity points for
each. student office are determined
each year by the Point Scale Commit-
tee from the recommendation of the
person who has ﬁlled that position the
preceding year. The evaluation of
each activity can be found in the
Vade Mecum, oﬂicial handbook of the
Women’s Self Government Associa-
tion.

The regulations set forth by
committee are as follows: _

1. No student is eligible to carry
points in student activities who did
not successfully carry twelve credits
during the preceding semester, and
who is not carrying.twelve credits
during the present semester.

2. No student shall be permitted to
carry more than ten activity points
at any one time without special per-
mission from the Point Scale Commit-
tee.

the

3. No student may represent the‘

University in conference, meeting or
performance off the campus until his
participation therein has been ap-
proved by the Dean of Men or the
Dean of Women in accordance with
the point scale requirements.

4. A student's activity load may be
limited at any time if a special
academic,-health, or social problem
arises.

5. No student may oﬁicially accept
a position in any- student organization
or activity unless his eligibility is ap-
proved by the Point Scale Committee.

Fine Arts Library Shows
Second Exhibition Of Art

The ﬁne arts library in State Hall
has put on display the second art ex-
hibition of this school year, a collec-
tion of fourteen prints, which include
works on Biblical stories, mythical
characters, portraits, and landscapes.
Each picture brings , to light some
speciﬁc detail or technique on the art
of etching, mezzotint, dry point, and
engraving.

There are two examples of old time
printing from Holland, each illus-
trated with a colored woodcut coii-
cerning the cruciﬁxion of Christ, A
colored woodcut by a Japanese artist
depicts an oriental dancer, in full re-
galia.

Historical Kaiser Augustus of Ger-
many is the subject of an intricate en-
gi'aviiig. Two German landscapes by
Albrecht Altdorfer, and a port and
a rural scene in black—and-white by
Claude Gellee of France are in vivid
contrast to the mythical battle of the
Sea-Centaurs and "St. Jerome and the
Lion.”

Sure, We Go To Collitch, Too.’

Engineers Sport New Jackets While Greek Majors Con-
sider Plato Crossing the Rubicon

 

 

By Charles B. Holstein
“Undoubtedly,” the engineers concluded, “something has to

be done about it.” »

The Dents, Owens, Miners, Bizads, and even misguided mem-
bers of the Pitt Panther staff, had stepped out with zipper jackets

of one sort or another, while the

shacks on the Hill were struggling along with almost no apparent

indications that they went to collitchl
So something was eventually done¢

denizens of Thaw Hall and the

about it, and» last week theengineers
swept down on the school with those
becoming blue jackets. (“Positively
all-wool, too, not half and half like
the other jackets you see around,"
the salesman insisted during the sales
campaign!) The engineers have. on
the backs of their jackets, what is, so
far, the best imitation of a disgrunt-
led panther, one such as chawed the
Ahrish a few weeks back—not what
the engineers describe as “The sickly
beast seen on the majority of the
jackets with a haunted look as if it
were caught stealing chickens from
the zoology department.”

The symbolic castle, insignia of the
engineering divisions in the World
War, is embroidered on the front of
these jackets, and the owners are
further identiﬁed by the initials of
-the departments of the school of En-,I
gineering in which each is enrolled.[

VVith the swinging over of the en-‘
gineers to the ranks of the jacketed,
students from practically every divi-
sion of the University, and a few so-
cial and activity groups, wear the
stamp of the marked. The College,
however, likely because of its iiii-
meiisity, diversiﬁed interests, and
disorganization (here can be found
poets and physics majors, pre-meds,
and journalists) has as yet obstinate-
ly refused to climb onto the beer-
wagon—oop——band-wagon, until Con-
gress convenes!

Latest rumors, however, have it
that Latin and Greek majors are con-
sidering banding together and buying
jackets, on these are to be a. picture,
perhaps, of Plato crossing the Rubi-
con, or is it Maximillian at the Nile?

Et too Brute? Sure he et. (The
guard’ll be along any minute now!)

Mary Garber Names Group
to Select Delegates

lvlary Garber, Col. '33, president of
Panhellenic Association, has appoint-
ed a committee to nominate two wom-
on as delegates to the annual» conven-
tion of National Urban Panhellenic
Associations to take place in Syra-
cuse, New York, January 10 and 11.
The committee consists of Lois Boggs,
Col. ’33, clriirman; Evangeline Jaffurs,
Ed. ’33, Both Kozak, Ed. ’33, Alice
Shannon, Pd. ’34, and Ethel Silver-
blatt, Col. '34.

Urban Panliellenic is an association

of groups f nctioning in city schools‘
only. Grou  thus situated have en-'
tirely different types of problems than
do campus schools, and because of
this, National Panhellenic is divided
into two branches, urban _and rural.

The Pitt Council ranks high in the
national organization, since the inter-
relation of sororities on the Pitt
campus is nearer than any other to
the ideal. It is a leader in the at-
tempt to discourage cut-throat poli-
tics and rushing, and to bring about
more amicable relations between the
Greek letter groups.

Delegates to last year’s convention
reported that on the majority of
other campuses a girl belonging to
one sorority does not speak to a girl
belonging to another group. A dele-
gate from one of the western schools
thought that the ultimate had been
reached when our delegate mentioned
the fact that at Pitt women from dif-
ferent groups Very often have lunch

Boner thinks a blizzard is some-

Why doesn’t somebody give him a
good pipe and some tobacco? For a
pipe helps a man to think straight. Of
course, it’s got to be the right tobacco.
But any college man can guide him
in that. A recent inzrestigation showed
Edgeworth to be the favorite smoking
tobacco at 42 out of 5!, leading colleges.

Which is only natural—for in all
tobaccodom there’s no blend like the
mixture of ﬁne old burleys found in
Edgeworth. In that diﬁerence there’s
a new smoking satisfaction, a new
comfort, for the man who likes to

The north and south will oppose each other next Saturday after-
-noon in Baltimore, but unlike the struggles of 70 years ago, the de-
-scendants.of.the blue and grey will battle in the interests of a com-

-mon cause—Charity. Generaled

by Dr. John B. Sutherland, the

marshaled northern forces-—a representative bea.r, bulldog, panther,
president, quaker, night r1der—“the cream, so far as is possible to
;pick, of the northern schools”——will be quartered at the Emerson

Hotel, beginning Monday morning in%

preparation for the east’s greatest
gesture in the interest of Charity next
-week-end.

Having thrown its hat into the foot-
ball ring for the ﬁrst time, the city
of Baltimore, its civic and welfare
organizations, is pre-paring for a crowd

gates to witness the struggle between
the pride of the north and south.

With the acceptance yesterday of
Ratamess, St. Thomas, back, and
Tom Gilbane, of Brown, the tentative
acaeptance. of Heller, Tormey, Daily
and Cuba, and the expected reply of
McNamara, the N. Y. U. backﬁeld
ﬂash, Coach .Sutherland’s mythical
-northern all-star eleven has been
picked. Twenty-two players will
make up the completed all-north
team, which will make a complete sec-
ond team to substitute during the
game’s progress.

Each player participating in the
game next week will be presented
with a gold watch and sweater in
token of appreciation for his willing-
ness in playing in this charity grid-
iron cla.ssic. During the week previ-
ous to the battle of the east, the
players. During the week previous
to the battle of the east, the players
will be feted at dinners, luncheons
and will be accompanied by hostesses
who have been selected by the civic

organization of Baltimore as repre-
senting the city’s prettiest. Dr. Suth-
erland will leave Pittsburgh this

evening for Baltimore where he will
meet his nothern horde for practice
Monday morning.

The following players who have
been recruited to ﬂy the colors of the
north in the charity game next Satur-
day are: Heller, Tormey, Daily and
Cuba, Pitt; DeCarbo, Duquesne; Dea-
cle, W. & J.; Lippoth, Columbia;

AAU Meets

Coach Pat Corr is working now on
arrangements that will bring several
A-A-U championships to the Trees
Gym pool next month. Several free-
style championships and possibly a
breast-stroke event will make up the
program for the meet.

Trees pool is an exceptionally fast
one and it is likely that with thel

present improved quality of local 3
swimmers AMA records will beg
broken. A forecast of this probablei

result was made in last week's record 3
smashing performance by women_
swimmers from the Homestead Li-5
brary Club and by members of the%
Pitt varsity team. I
The varsity swimmers are now eh-l
gaged in the toughest part of the pre-l
limmary training grind before going"
back to practicing the dashes. All
this week the team has churned an
average of three quarters of a mile at
each practice session. I
Every freestyler of the varsity team‘
is now well below one minute flat for
the hundred yard dash, but coach
Corr is expecting an even greater im-
provement after the completion of ,
Practice over the longer routes. ‘

Hurt Suttered in Tech Game
Disables Pitt Captain

 

Paul Reider, Pitt football captain
injured in the Carnegie Tech game
of two weeks ago, should be fully re-
covered in from two to four weeks
from the present date. His attend-
ing physician Dr. C. C. Yount ex-
pressed this opinion Wednesday even-
ing. , y

The exact diagnosis of Reider’s in-
jury according to Dr. Yount is that
the star right halfback is suffering
from a badly sprained left knee in-
volving a slight dislocation of the

Halt Way’, Warns
Dr. Carlson

Under the auspices of the Stu-
dent Health Service, Dr. H. C. Carl-
son has compiled a paper giving
some very interesting facts about
tobacco and the use of tobacco.
He tells us that in the seven-
teenth century, the use of tobacco
was punishable in Russia by bit-
ing off the nose of the user. At
different times, Germany, France,
England, Japan and Austria have
attempted to forestall the use of
the weed by legislation.

Despite these attempts, Dr.
Carlson says, the tobacco indus-
try has grown into a $3,000,000,-
000 annual business. In explana-
tion of these astounding ﬁgures,
Dr. Carlson gives the following
explanation: “The lethal poison,
nicotine, in tobacco, corresponds
to the drug opium found in the
poppy, and is just as habit form-
ing, although with less serious re-
sults.”

“If you must smoke, however,”
says Dr. Carlson, “smoke in mod-
eration; do not inhale; throw
them away half ﬁnished, the
closer the light to the mouth the
more poison absorbed; reach ma-
turity before starting; don’t be
ashamed of smoking in the pres-
ence of others, but don’t try to
get converts.”

‘Continuing the policy that Coach
Orsini laid out for the boxing team
last year, ten members of the boxing
squad will give an exhibition of box-
ing at Freedom High School tonight.

The occasion is the annual Freedom
High School Stunt Night, and to-
night’s appearance will mark the sec-
ond appearance of Pitt boxers at
Freedom. The ten boxers, Coach
Orsini, and a squad of managers will
leave the Stadium at ‘seven o’clock
tonight, and wil-1 drive to the high
school.

The ﬁve bouts consist of two in the
115-pound class; one in the 120-pound
class; and two in the 155-pound class.

In the 115-pound class bouts, Charles

Junge will meet James Zipf, and Len

Plan, Weather Mars Display

After the spelling out of “Pop” and
“Jock” by the special cheering sec-
tion at Saturday's game, Mr. William
Brinker, chemical engineering in-
structor and coach of the cheerlead-
ers, declared himself satisfied with
the stunt .plan tried here this football
season, the ﬁrst time by an Eastern
student cheering section,

The ﬁrst schools to use‘ these card
formations were those on the West
Coast. A higher degree of perfection
was reached there because of the fair
weather that usually was present -on
football days. During the Pitt-Car-
negie Tech game, it was planned to
have a stunt showing the Cathedral

_of Learning, but the rain faded the

cards and it was impossible to make
the displays. In the West, every
student wears a white sweater or
shirt so as to give a better natural

background

.Difficu1t designs that were impossi-
ble with the old crepe paper now can
be formed. Although the cardboards
allow an unlimited number of stunts,
they demand greater cooperation from
the student body. Each seat has its
special stunt card, which the student
must use properly. For instance, in
forming a Panther, if one student
failed to follow his directions the
Panther might have no claws:

Cheerleaders must work two after-
noons a week to form the blue prints
of the stands‘ and designthe stunts.
Then, on Saturday mornings from
7 o’clock until 12, they are engaged
in tacking the cards and directions to
the seats.

Fraternities Will Stage
Annual Bowling Tourney

Interfraternity athletic activities,
which have been quiet for quite a
while, will be renewed in full force
when the annual interfraternity bowl-
ing tournament gets under way.

,Two leagues, of seven fraternities
each, will be formed. and fraternities
have been warned not to enter unless
they intend to participate in all their
scheduled games. Each fraternity de-
siring to enter has been asked to
submit a list of ten eligible members
for the tourney.

A team will consist of ﬁve mem-
bers, and the customary bowling reg-
ulations will be adhered to. The
usual scoring system will be used,
and three full games will be played
each day on which the matches are
scheduled. Matches will be held at
the Center and Neville Bowling al-
leys, and the tournament will get
under way Wednesday night, Decem-
ber 7, at 7 o'clock.

A committee consisting of Allison

Cub Reporter Gets A Scoop.’

 

Fair Young Maiden, Gentleman Bandits, Shoe Store Rob-
bery, Imprisoned Clerk: and it Rated Only Seven Lines

 

By Joseph M. Katz
Trudging wearily from a day’s work at the Pittsburgh Press,
where every Tuesday the young reporter attempts to add a few more
“inches” to his meager list, as required by the journalism depart-
ment, he happened to pass down Market street near Liberty, when

a fair maiden flew into his arms.
yelled!

‘ ‘ Police !

Robbery ! Police !’ ’ she

That’s the beginning of the story.

A policeman came.
The young lady came to.

“Officer,” she panted, “the man in
the shoe store was held up, and he's
locked up in the washroom!”

Like the true newspaperman as out-

lined by Mr. Maulsby, head of the de-
partment of journalism, every Mon-
day, Wednesday, and Friday, the re-
porter called the night editor of the
Pittsburgh Press. He explained that
the Hanover Shoe Store, 508 Market
street, had just been robbed. The
night editor answered that a reporter
would be sent over immediately.

Several policemen, d.t’s, and a re-
porter from the Post-Gazette entered
the store as he went back. Boldly he
knocked on the plate glass door, and
told the cop that he was from the
Press. He awaited the story that the
clerk, already rescued from the wash-
room, would tell, that the next day
might be a screaming headline across
page one, Nervously the man out-
lined the story; how he was closing
the store when two well-dressed men
came in to buy a pair of spats; how
one of the men shoved a gun into his
ribs and said, “raise your hands up,
and give me the cash;” how he had
previously hid the money on a stool
under the desk; and how when the
enraged mountebanks found only a
dollar in the cash box socked him, and
locked him up in the washroom in the
rear of the store.

A little later everyone left the
store, and the cub had to wait outside
for the Press reporter. But the Press
man did not arrive, and he resolved
to take the story to the Press him-
self. On the way there and on his
way up the elevator he was thinking

A crowd came:

of some sensational lead that might
start out three columns wide, set in
bold type with the word “Bulletin” at
the top. Dashing into the editorial
room of the paper, he tried to tell a.
bald-headed man that a -robbery was
committed and that he had full de-
tails.

What visions the poor scribe had of
his scoop! At eight a. in. he called
up his newsdealer to ﬁnd out of the
Press was out. Impatient, he ducked
the fourth hour W'ednesday, and made
a bee-line for a news stand down
Forbes street.

Alack—and all the alasses needed-—
the headline said something about an
international settlement parley. And
’way down at the bottom of the page
was a six or seven-line story about
some robbery that had been com-
mitted in a shoe store the previous
night!

The Scholarship Inquiry

ITH a legislative investigation of the alleged sale of senatorial

scholarships virtually assured, the outcome of the oﬁicial in-

quiry becomes the concern of every student matriculated in a state-
aided university.

Already the general attitude of the senatorial group has been
expressed in the statement of Senator William D. Mansﬁeld that he
would institute a senatorial investigation into charges that several
scholarships had been sold. The pledged cooperation of the heads of
the four state institutions who grant scholarships further strengthens
the hope that persons guilty of such “racketeering” will be appre-
hended and punished. ,

The allegations of corrupt policy in awarding, on a basis of per-
sonal gain, scholarships that are intended for needy constituents is
a viciously implied indictment of our legislators. As such it un-
doubtedly will receive their immediate attention in a concerted ac-
tion to remove anydoubt as to the honesty of the group as a whole.

The suggestion that perhaps a senatorial investigation would re-
sult in the practice of granting scholarships being deﬁnitely discon-
tinued might not come as a complete surprise to those students who
have had some experience in obtaining senatorial scholarships. Not
every applicant for a senatorial scholarship can be cared for, the
number of worthy candidates by far_ exceeding the available awards.
One local state senator is said to have had over 75 new applicants
on his list at the close of last summer, this number not including the
“carry-over” from previous years.

Obviously, it is reasonable to suppose that the senators them-
selves make more enemies than friends in their handling of the
scholarship awards. As a matter of expediency, the group might see
ﬁt to drop the practice entirely; but that is entirely conjecture, and
a possibility which we, as students, would certainly deplore. That
would be the easy way out.

Regardless of what'is learned by any proposed investigation,

would it not be _a worthy move to amend the system to conform with
that practiced by one or two senators of their own accord? What is
there to preventzthe adoption of a uniform system of competitive ex-
aminations forall candidates, a plan similar to that used by Senator
Frank Harris“.-‘.3 I “ _ H

Such aniov"e ‘could only be interpreted by the students and citi-
zens of the commonwealth as evidence of the honesty and good faith
of their representatives at Harrisburg. "

“Represen-l:ativesi Abroad

 

 ,th'ej,Men’s Debating Association announces an impressive

schedule“of forensic contests away from home. Leaving late

in January, a picked team will travel from Pittsburgh, meeting

speakers from other prominent colleges and universities along the
Atlantic seaboard from Washington, D. C., to Miami, Florida. A

Debate audiences “abroad,” we are told, have a q_uality of num-
bers seldom recognized on our own campus. Other institutions and
student bodies rank students of argumentation and their programs
somewhat higher than do we at the University of Pittsburgh. That
regard is evidenced in the public support given the debate teams on
other campi.

And yet, in spite of such facts, Pitt is perhaps better known for
its debate teams than is any other university or college in America.
Dr. Parrish and his students are as readily identiﬁed with the Uni-
versity at other institutions as are the coaches and members of our
athletic teams.

In spite of many handicaps, principally that thing known as
home “support,” the members of the debate squad have earned their
own place in the light of national prominence. In so doing they
have contributed more than a little to the prestige of the University.
‘We admire them for it.

To the Editor, Pitt News:

In a. recent editorial in the Pitt
News the writer stated that Dr.
Clothier’s successor should be a Pitt
man. In contradiction of this state-
ment I believe the new dean of men
shoul-d be chosen -from out of town.

Any man that would be chosen
from the University would have the
same ideas as his predecessor and
what Pitt needs is new ideas, new
thoughts, and new minds to contribute
to these ideas. Pitt, while supposed-
ly in the process of change, has be-
come stagnant in its ways of doing
things. From one year to the next
activities are operated on the same
plan.

The students would be more or less
intimately acquainted with any out-
standing member of the faculty or ad-
ministration that would be chosen to
ﬁll Dean Clothier’s vacancy. This, in

I itself, is a bad factor because the stu-

dents learn to regard the man on a
too personal basis. The student
knows the way the man will handle
the situation. Thus the University
comes to a standstill, never changing,
always the same. A school such as
Pitt cannot afford to be regarded in
this light. The University should be-
come broader, adopt new policies and
in this way it will become a greater
institution.

In view of -all these facts it can
readily be seen that it would be
pure fallacy to choose a man from
the University. We need new men
to bring us ‘new thoughts and new
ideas and the officials should-. select
an outstanding personality -from else-
where to be our new dean of men.

MARIAN H. BEYER, Col. ’33.

 

To the Editor, Pitt News:

I sincerely regret that in your ar-
ticle with reference to the alleged
“Disarmament Controversy” appear-
ing on page four of the issue of No-
vember 23, 1932, you saw ﬁt to men-
tion my name. Such mention would
seem to infer that I am one of the
participants in the alleged controver-
sy. I am compelled to deny most
emphatically that I have or ever
will engage in any controversy, de-
bate or dispute with any faculty mem-
ber or student on the whys and
wherefores -of disarmament or the
limitation of armaments.

As an officerof the regular army I
have been ordered to duty at the Uni-
versity ‘of Pittsburgh solely to teach
subjects pertaining to Military sci.
ence and Tactics, and to teach only
to those students who voluntarily elect
to pursue this course of instruction.
It is neither my privilege nor my pur-
pose to expound my personal ‘opinion
on the matter of disarmament or the
limitation of armaments. The policy
that our nation will eventually adlopt
is a matter for Congress to decide. As
a soldier, it is my duty to conform
fully to that policy, both in-thought,
word and deed. As a. member of the
faculty of this University it is my
duty to confo-rm to the policy of the
University and to serve its best in-
terests at all times. You must ex-
cuse me therefore when I am com-
pelled to ask that my name not be
mentioned- as a participant in_ any al-
leged controversy on the subject of
Disarmament. .

I trust that you will see fit to pub-
lish this letter and I thank you for the
consideration that you have always
shown. . .. .
Sincerely, -

E. J. CULLEN,
Lt. Colonel, U. S. Army.

In hearing Heifetz one’ comes to
realize that there are two kin-ds of
artists who play the music of others.
One likes to give us Beethoven as he
feels it should be played, passing up
the composer’s annotations to add a
stroke of thunder here or to soften a
bar or so elsewhere. The other,
through a perfect realization of the
composer’s intention, allows the mu-
sic to speak for itself.

Heifetz is an artist of this -degree.
Perhaps no one has just his facility
for direct, unadulterated communica-
tion—a quality which shows not only
the highest respect for the masters
but which endears him to us through
gratitude for giving what the crea-
tors really i11ten-ded us to hear. We
can enjoy an evening to be sure, hear-
ing one man’s “interpretation” of the
Unfinished Symphony, but to get
truly next to the master, to hear his
own perfection repeated is more de-
sired and certainly the highest one
can ask.

Recital Stands Out

For this reason, the Heifetz recital
was the more purely enjoyable of the
season so far. The program, excel-
lently varied, showed mastery and a
sustained rendering of feeling. The
Grieg Sonata seems to have lost
nothing of its witchery. Grieg usual-
ly manages to get a strong poetic con-
ception into his work; and in this it
is the mist of rocky promonotories,
the ﬂashing blue water beneath, a love
song, and the sun dancing on the
scanty hay-slopes that please the im-
agination.

The Mozart Concerto was the high-
point. For a long time it has been
considered one of Mozart’s ﬁnest com-
positions for.- the violin. Certainly it
draws on the most lyrical and felicit-
ous qualities of the instrument, be-
ginning with an Allegro aperto, with
its swift, beautiful me-lody; then mov-
ing into ..an .Adagio, full of deep color;
and closing with a Minuet in the best
Mozart vein. _

The performance of the Bach Ada-
gio and Fugue places Hei-fetz’s ac-
-complishment beyond dispute. The
joyous sense impression of the
Bumble.Bee followed-», and was grac-I
iously repeated. Ravel’s Tzigane
was a ﬁne note on which to end the
evening, building rapidly into» a
stormy crescendo so that one came
away with echoes of big soun-ds and
splendid colors in his brain.

nity and a positive human interest.
Nicodemus includes much of this
better side. -Some of the poems have
appeared elsewhere, but in this vol-
ume Robinson brings them into a mu-
tually-honored companionship and
makes one feel a little more his im-
portance in American poetry. Nico-
demus, Tousaint
Ponce De Leon are the finest poems
included; each a study of a man grop-
ing toward some principle, noble in
his effort, yet pitifully hindered. This
is the key to most of what Robinson
says, for he sees in all men a toiling
toward a mistaken end, while others
often obscuring the prize that lies be-
fore his own hands. He says it best in
Ponce De Leon:
