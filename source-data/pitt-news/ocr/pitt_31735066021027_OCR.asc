Playboy picture poses problems for Pratte

Pekich refuted the allegation,
saying, ”I informed her that we
would be taking disciplinary ac-
tion, but that is the meeting
tomorrow. I told her she may no

. longer be a pledge [following the

Thursday meeting]”.

Pratte was instructed that the
possiblility of her being de-
pledged was apparent, but that it

.would not be decided until

Thursday's meeting.

Collegiate Chapter Director
Robin Bedwell explained that
when news of Pratte’s posing sur-

faced, she contacted the Delta
Zeta regional headquarters. At
that time, Bedwell was instruct-
ed to take appropriate actions.

”I can see if I would have worn
my letters in the picture, or used
my real name but I didn’t,” said
Pratte. ”Everytime I did publici-
ty, I never said anything about the
sorority. Some people knew that
I was in the sorority, but now
everybody knows.”

Pratte contends the pledges
were not told that posing for the

Pitt police tea

By Lou Grieco
Senior Staff Writer

Tracy Vannare, the responding
officer, seemed nervous while on
the witness stand. She blushed as

_ she avoided eye contact with the
‘prosecutor.

Dressed in a pink miniskirt,
pink blouse and matching ear-
rings without a blond hair out of
place, Vannare’s voice quaked as
she answered questions about the
murder.

It was the 10th-grader’s first
courtroom experience. As a
member of Explorer Post 592, she
got to participate in a ”mock tri-

iial” on Feb. 21. A

’’I was scared at first,” Vannare

says, ”but I liked it. I'd like to be
_ a lawyer. ‘IT just didn’t.want to

 

mess up.”

For Vannare and other local
high school students interested in
careers in law enforcement, the
Explorer group offers them a valu-
able experience. Sponsored by

. the University of Pittsburgh Cam-

pus Police, the officers give stu-
dents ”hands-on’v’ training that
they could not get anywhere else.
The. Explorers learn the crimi-
nal code, self—defense, search pat-
terns, testifying in court and how
to approach a crime scene. There
are special instructional programs
for CPR, identification of street
drugs and when an officer can
use his gun. Sometimes, the Ex-
plorers ride with the officers on
patrols. -
’ ”Ther_e is some classwork, but

the hands-on experieniceis the 

Th lessons in law enforcement

key,” says Officer Vernon Bark-
ley, who does much of the teach-
ing for the group. ”We cover the
basics of what they have to know
in the police academy. Our ob-
jective is to give them a taste of
what it's like to work in law en-
forcement.”

EIEIIZI

The Explorers program is part
of the Boy Scouts of America,
though it is coed. Originally
designed as an outdoors program
in the 19505, the program's focus
became career-oriented in_the
early 1970s.

This is the third year the depart-
ment has sponsored the program.
Officer Rich Stiger started th_e
groupafter he learned aboutithe

 

Explorer's program from a letter.
/ ”I liked the idea,” Stiger says,
”so‘| took it to [then] Director
Tucker, who saidto give it a try.
Now Director [William] Brennan
is even more enthusiastic. Tuck-
er offered support, but Brennan
wants to become actively in-
valved.”

Stiger says he feels that it is im-
portant to work with teenagers, to
help them decide if they want to
pursue a career in law enforce-
ment. He adds that he enjoys
working in the program.

”I like kids. Mine are all grown

up, so I need some new ones to

play with.”

By Sharon Kereste
Staff Writer -

Although it is not specifical-
ly a service sorority, the Alpha
Kappa Alpha Chapter at Pitt is
based on service, participating
in various community projects
throughout the year. '

One of the sorority’s main
projects is visiting the Shuman
Center, a juvenile detention
hall in Pittsburgh.

The sorority sisters visit at
least three times a year, main-
ly on holidays such as Valen-
tine's Day and Thanksgiving.
They give parties where -the
children can listen to music,

talk. ._

"We're there just as a”sup—
port system,” said AKA’ Presi-
dent Michelle Chambers. ”|t’s
a chance for them to enjoy;
themselves and hopefully get
their minds off the other things
that are going on.”

AKA, along with another Pitt. 11'

sorority,» also worked with
Project Star, an adoption agen-
cy in Squirrel Hill. _

The members of the sorori-

ties had a party for all the par- ‘H

ents who had adopted chil-

gathering gave the famiIies.a-{is

at Westinghouse High School."
The girls talk to students and
encourage them to attend col-

Israel elections vindicate PL 0 position

JERUSALEM (AP) ~ The right
wing scored a decisive victory in
Israel's municipal elections and
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
said yesterday the voters had vin-
dicated his refusal to deal with
the PLO.

The elections Tuesday extend-
ed the power of his Likud bloc on
the local level and gave major
gains to Jewish and Moslem fun-
damentalists.

Teddy Kollek, the moderate
Labor Party's best-known mayor,
won a sixth term in Jerusalem but
lost control of the City Council.

A preliminary count gave reli-
gious parties 12 of the 31 coun-
cil seats, up from 10 in 1983.
Kol|ek’s One Jerusalem slate got
11 or 12 seats, down from 17;
four went to Likud and three or
four to the secular Citizens Rights
Movement.

More seats on the council will
give religious parties greater pow-
er to enforce demands that
restaurants and theaters close on
the Jewish Sabbath, but Kollek

said he won't make concessions
that ”do not conform to the will
of the majority.”

At stake in Tuesday's elections
were 147 mayor's offices and city
councils. Labor won 54 in 1983,
Likud 26 and the rest went to lo-
cal or religious parties.

Final results are not expected
until later in the week, but Labor
estimates it lost control of at least
10 town councils, including
several in traditional strongholds.
Most were taken by Likud, in-
cluding five of the largest cities.

Representatives will
work with Pa. S&Ls

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ Penn-
sylvania's predominantly healthy
savings and loans are grudgingly
accepting that they, too, must pay
a price to nurse the industry back
to health, Rep. Tom Ridge, R—Pa.,
said yesterday.

Ridge said during a news brief-
ing that he generally backed

President Bush’s recent S&L
bailout plan, but that he hoped
the government would be sensi-
tive to the needs of solid thrifts -
those that have been adhering to
good management and invest-
ment practices.

Ridge, of Erie, and Democrat-
ic Rep. Paul Kanorski of Wilkes-
Barre are the only Pennsylvania
members on the House Commit-
tee on Banking, Finance and Ur-
ban Affairs, which has been
monitoring the S&L crisis.

Murder trial delayed
by legal technicality

PHlLADELPHlA (AP) ~ Ar-
raignment for a woman accused
of drowning her 7-week-old son
and dismembering the body was
delayed yesterday by a judge
who said the same lawyer could
not represent both her and her

husband in the case.

Despite testimony by Tanya
and Phillip Dacri that they want-
ed attorney A. Charles Peruto Jr.,
to represent them together, Com-
mon Pleas Judge Joseph O’Keefe
ruled he was ”concerned about
the possibility of a conflict of in-
terest.”

O’Keefe said he would appoint
another lawyer for the 20-year-
old Mrs. Dacri.

He postponed her arraignment
on murder and other charges un-
til next Tuesday, the same day set
for a preliminary hearing for her
husband, 22, who is charged
with helping dispose of the re-
mains of Zacharry Dacri after he
was killed Jan:~8.

thing for granted.”

The Voter Registration Drive
at Pitt is another activity under-
taken by AKA. The sorority
feels that it is important to fo-
cus on the students because
they are not always aware that
they can vote while they are at
school.

AKA donates to various
charities such as the NAACP

and the Tabatha Foster fund. It

also sponsors lectures to in-
crease student awareness in
various areas.

The ideas for these projects
come from within the sorority
itself, but AKA is also kept in-
formed by the Panhellenic As-
sociation.

Chambers said that she has
”only gotten positive feed-
back” concerning the AKA’s
charitable efforts.

magazine could jeopardize their

standing in the sorority.

Delta Zeta Vice—President
Pledge Trainer Andrea Mercurio
explained, ”At the first meeting
[during the fall of 1988] the en-
tire group of pledges were read
our sorority’s code of regulations
and each pledge understood that
their actions represent the entire
sorority.” -

Pekich would not quote the ex-
act text that Pratte reportedly vio-
lated, citing the material as a
”secrecy of the sorority.”

Pratte said she was warned not

‘ .to' say anything ”bad”to the me-

dia about the sorority or charges
could be brought against her.

Pekich again disputed Pratte’s
allegations, ”The word, charges,
or legal whatever, was not
brought up. I told her if slander
was done there may be reper-
cussions.”

On Tuesday morning Pratte ap-
peared on WTAE—TV’s Pitts-

0burgh’s Talking where she talked '

about her experiences with Play-
boy with host Ann Devlin. When
asked whether or not posing had
had a bad effect on her life, Pratte
revealed her sorority’s reaction.

"If they had not called me,”
Pratte said, ’’I would not have
said a word about the sorority.
Even thoughl knew they were

_ upset [with her posing], I still"
‘.wasn’t going to say anything [un-

til Pekich’s phone call].”

statement that she was ”disap—
pointed” Pratte had talked to the
media before the sorority had a
chance to consult her about the
disciplinary charges.

Pratte said she has not decided
whether or not to contact an at-
torney about possible damages
against the sorority.

members to 26, with three of the
graduates going on to careers in
the law enforcement sections of
the military.

”They’re kind of my model
post,” says Sheila Buckley, coor-
dinator of Allegheny Trails Coun-
cil, who helped Stiger start the
post. ’’I can say that it is one of
the best law enforcement posts in
the council.

"From the beginning, it was al-
ways a stable post, because so
many officers got involved.
When l try to get corporate. fund-
ing, I can use Explorer Post 592
to sell the idea to them.”

While on the witness stand,
Tony l.undy seemed more
relaxed than many of the others
who had testified. Dressed in a
pink shirt with a thin tie, his suit

right on the cutting edge of fa-
sion, he looked more like a cloth-
ing store employee in a suburban
shopping mall than a police
officer. B-ut he sounded like a
police officer.

"The funny thing is that there
was a homicide on my street this
summer,” he says. ’’I was a little
scared I might confuse the details
of that murder with the mock
murder while on the stand._

”The main thing I tried to do
was direct my answers towards
the jury, because they would be
making the decision. The officers
taught us to do that.”

Lundy, who has been in the
program for two years, says that
his experience with the Explorers
helped him to remain calm at the
site of the homicide last summer.
A high school senior, he plans to
enter the Air Force after graduati-
ing, to work in the Military Police
division. He hopes to go to the

”()n the whole, it's been a
good experience,” he says,
knowledgeably. ”They've taught
me a lot. I have to give the
officers credit for putting up with
a lot of what goes on in the class.
They’re a great group of guys.”

The other Explorers seem to
feel the same way. Both Eric Hol-
mes and Brian Roberts hope to
study criminal justice at the
University of Maryland next year.
They say that their experience in
the Explorers helped them make
up their minds.

Courtney Colcomb, a junior,
wants to study criminology after
she finishes high school. She says
her time with the Explorers in-
creased her interest in law en-
forcement.

’’I like the program because it
made a lot of things clearer,” Col-
comb says. ’’It showed me what
it really would be like to be a
police officer. It took away the
glamour of television.”

Short, stocky and professional-
looking in uniform, Officer Bark-

   
   
 

ley paces back and forth in a
5-foot space in his office as he
discusses his views on teenagers,
Explorers and law enforcement in
general. His left hand in his pock-
et, Barkley seems to gesture on a
steady beat with his right, every
other footstep. ,

”Every year in the first weeks
of September, we send out fliers
to local high schools,” Barkley
says. ”From the fliers, we get a list
of kids who are interested, and
mail letters to them.

”We are looking for the ones
who are sincerely interested.
Many of the kids who show up
for the first meeting don't stay in
the program.”

Part of the reason for this is
time. The Explorers meet every
other Tuesday for meetings, and
put in time on weekends. To raise
money to buy their uniforms, the
Explorers have hoagie sales and

car washes. The Campus Police‘

also pay them to wash patrol cars
and shuttle vans.

”These kids have homework,
and many of them have jobs as
well,” Barkley says. ”So only the
really dedicated ones stick
around. Sometimes, we have the

’’It’s funny, but a lot of times
the kids will discuss things with
us they won't talk to their parents
or guidance counselors about.
They want direction. We tell
them to talk to their parents, and
we advise them to go either to
college or into the military.”
Barkley says he hopes to ex-
pand the program in the next few
years, bringing in more guest

speakers, especially attorneys. He95

says that he‘ is happy with Direc-
tor Brennan’s enthusiasm for the
program. Brennan sees Explorer
Post 592 as another way for the
department to improve ”commu—
nity relations” in the Oakland
area.

After the trial, Brennan told the
Explorers and their parents that

5)

the program showed that the.

Campus Police are friends of the
citizens of Pittsburgh.

”Most of these people are here
on their own time,” Brennan
said. ”lf you focus on what hap-
pened here tonight-, you'll see
that we enjoy working with the
community.

A good example for
international groups

The European Community consists of 12 member na-
tions organized into three different groups, each
specializing in different areas (i.e., economics, atomic
energy). Recently, the EC has taken two major actions
involving world situations.

The first of these involves Iran and the Ayatollah
Khomeini’s death threats to Salman Rushdie. The EC

responded quickly to Khomeini’s terroristic threats by I

‘ condemning Iran's position, withdrawing all ambas-

sadors from the country and suspending high-level visits
to and from Iran with the member nations.

The second act affecting world politics was the Euro-
pean Economic Community's recent donation of $37.8
million in aid to the victims of an earthquake in
Leninakan, Armenia, which produced 40,000 casual-
ties and caused major property damage to the city. The
EEC isa sub-division of the Community.

The EC has shown that there is a great deal of merit

in the formation ofan inter—governmental body. Unlike

the United Nations, a body which is slow to act and
ineffective in action, the EC has been expeditious and
effective, as seen in both of these examples. They per-
ceived a need for decisive action and did something

_. about it.

Q

When considering the mechanics of global politics,
it is obvious that the management of a group of nations
with differing political philosophies and ideological
stances is a tremendously difficult task. The EC has
proven that it can be done. The U.N. and any future
international unions can learn a great deal about effi-
ciency and cooperation from its example.

Ethics for publishers

Censorship is an_ issue which has been appearing in
the media in an intense fashion as of late. The closing
of The Duquesne Duke, purportedly on grounds of an
"objectionable" advertisment run on its pages, is a good
example of a local aspect of this phenomenon. Other
college papers receiving similar treatment include the

Vassar Spectator, and the University of Iowa Campus"

Review. Now the specter has extended its reach to Stars
and Stripes, the newspaper of the U.S. armed forces.

There have been strong complaints about army brass
editing and suppressing stories. Prominent figures such
as Sen. William Proxmire have spoken out publicly,
concerned about, and disapproving of the ' paper's
refusal to run stories such as AIDS-related pieces and

. a story about Korean women whomarry servicemen,

D

‘»‘*4«

then come to the United States and engage in prostitu-
tion. In fact, Proxmire’s- Comments on the paper were
edited out of a story and replaced with more‘ positive
quotes from the paper's editor.

The press is business. It can be bought and sold, and
it is owned. Since the law only extends as far as the
hand that holds the purse strings, there is a need for
an ethical code to guide. relations between publishers
and papers, just as there are codes for journalists’ be-
havior. With all of the recent controversy, this is be-
coming more and more obvious and necessary to allow
for rthe most effective utilization of our First Amendment
rig ts.

Cool behavior for Spring Break

1 Everyone is pretty excited
about Spring Break. I know that

_,I’m looking forward to going to
New York City, where I'll visit fa-
mily, take a walk through the city,
and spend some time trying to get
some exposure on New York's

fun, I wish that I were cool

“drinking as much as"possible (be— .

is doing), and trying to have sex
with all of the bimbos who go to
Daytona and open themselves Lip
to that type of behavior.

Seeing all of the ads for Spring
Break in Daytona Beach and
spring-break movies, witnessing
Spring Break on MTV (Morons
That Vegitate), and hearing how
"totally ultimate” Daytona Beach
is,_has made me realize that New
York City is a "bogus place to

Last year, Pitt's Allan Utter
made history by becoming the
first—ever unseeded wrestler to
win the Eastern Wrestling
League championship.

This season, Utter faces the
same predicament. He has not
wrestled all that often this sea-
son, owns a I6-7 record and
will probably go into this
weekend's tournament as an
unseeded grappler.

”I can't let something like
that bother me when I go out
onto the mat,” Utter said. ’’I
figure, to win the thing, you
are going to have to beat the
best guy. So, whether I'm
seeded or not, I'll have to go
into every match with the
same attitude."

 

retli -

Utter will have another
thing against him. During the
season, he has wrestled at the
142- and I50-pound divisions.
In the EWL, he will drop down
to I34. .

”Dropping a weight class
can be  a problem,” Utter
said. ’’I didn't want to be light-
er during the season, because
I didn't think that I could keep
it there. I feel better wrestling
at the lighter weight and I
thought it would be better for
the tournament."

Last year, Utter was. able to
surprise everyone — except
Coach Rande Stottlemyer,
who predicted the victory —
by rolling through the tourney.
This time around, it will take
an extra effort. Clarion’s Mike
Cole, the No.1 wrestler in the
country at -I42-pounds, is ru-

mored to be moving down to
134 at the EWLs.

”He will definitely be a
challenge,” Utter said. ”To
win the championship, I'm
sure that you are going to have
to beat him. But I can't be wor-
ried about him. I just have to
focus on what I have to do and
go about doing it. I think I can
win, or get pretty close.”

As far as the team is con-
cerned, Utter thinks the Pan-
thers can do a pretty good job.

”This is probably the best
team that I have been a part of.
here at Pitt,” Utter said. ’’We

can beat anybody in the

league, and I'm sure that we
will challenge for the team
championship.”

Penn State is the early
favorite, but with the emer-

Pitt's Pat Santoro is the early favorite to take another Eastern Wrestling championship this weekend at Clarion.

Utter hopes for EWL tournament rerun

gence of Pitt, Clarion and EWL
newcomer Edinboro, things
are really up in the air.

”I have a feeling that it will
be very _close in the end,” Ut-
ter said. ”Every team is very
good. With the way things are,
anybody can come away with
the victory.”

The NCAA is now taking the
top four competitors in each
weight class for the National
Championships on March
16-18 at Oklahoma City, as
opposed to three previously.

”I think that is the best thing
that could be done,” Utter
said. ”There are so many good
wrestlers in this league, that
even with four, some will be
left out."

Pitt's wrestling team travels
to Clarion University this
weekend to compete in the
Eastern Wrestling Tour-
nament.

According to Pitt wrestling
coach Rande Stottlemyer, the
competition will be fierce and
balanced. »

”We’re looking forward to
the challenge,” said Stott-
lemyer. ”It’s going to be a
heck of a tournament. I don't
know how we're gonna do.
We have the potential to win,
or we could fall flat on our
faces, that's what kind of tour-
nament it's going to be.”

Penn State is considered the
odds-on favorite, but Lock
Haven, Bloomsburg and Pitt
could all challenge for the top
spot. Other teams in the EWL
include: Clarion, Cleveland
State, West Virginia and
Edinboro.

Pitt placed fourth in the tour-
nament last year, just two
points out of third and seven
points behind second place.
Penn State was last year's EWL
champion.

”We’ve definitely gotten
better, but the rest of the com-
petition has also improved. So,
it's hard to say if anything will
change a lot,” said Stott-

-Stottlemyer said he will be
relying heavily on his seniors.
He said the seniors will be the
key to either the success or
failure of the team.

All-American Pat Santoro
will be counted on at the
I42-pound weight class. He is
the defending champion at his
weight. g

”I’m just going to wrestle as
hard as I can and try to wear
my opponent out,” said San-
toro. ”I’m not going to try any-
thing different from last year.”

Alan Utter, defending cham-
pion at 134 pounds, also looks
to continue his impressive per-
formances.

”Everybody in this league is
capable of winning,” Utter
said. ”You just have to keep
your focus.” I ”

Stottlemyer also hopes his
other seniors will add to Pitt's
scoring output. Pitt's other

Athletes don’t always study by themselves

By Chris Bosak
Staff Writer

Being a college student and
athlete often requires as much
time as a full—time job, which
leaves little time for studies and
other academic responsibilities.

Pitt has a program designed to
help those athletes who find it

A difficult to keep up in both aca-

demics and athletics._ The pro-
gram is called the Academic
Support Services for Student
Athletes.

. The program employs five full-
time professional staff members.
All have a college background in

. _ teaching and are also certified in

counseling. .
_The service not only provides‘

athletes with tutors, but also‘ with ‘

.v ; '. .‘.':5.<.‘_._ .. g ‘.  It,"

guidance in scheduling and
career interests. Although athletes
are not required to use the serv-
ice, about half of the athletes at
Pitt do, according to Paul Yuna,
director of the academic support
services.

”Footba|| players utilize the
program heavily,” said Yuna.
”Freshmen and sophomores use
the program to help them
through the basic skills courses
and help them get off to a good
start. Upperclassmen use us for
advice on the possibilities of go-
ing to graduate school."

' The program was established at

Pitt in 1976. Two major reasons

contributed to the origin of the
program, according to Yuna.

In 1973, colleges started; heav- »
. i|y’recruit_ing ath|etes".froin the',in- ’

  
    

ner cities and the rural south.
Also, in 1976, the NCAA’s Title
9 gave female athletes equal op-
portunity in athletics. These fac-
tors drastically increased the
population of student athletes,

creating a need for some kind of 9

academic support system.
Carnel Smith, a junior defen-
sive end for the Pitt football team,

said he uses the services often for *

the various aspects of academics.
He also encourages underclass-
men to utilize the services, which
are located.in Pitt Stadium, as
often as they need to.

”The help is thereif you need
it,” said Smith. ”lt's just a" matter
of not being lazy and getting up
there." ' V ‘

certain subjects or areas of aca-
demics that the full-time staff just

can't help the athletesin, usual- ~

Iy math and science courses.

In those cases, the program sets
the athlete up with a part-time
student tutor who can better
serve the athlete's needs. These
tutors are either graduate students
or bright undergraduates, accord-
ing to Yuna.

Christine Gallagher, a freshman
swimmer at Pitt, has mixed feel-
ings about the service. She was
satisfied with the help she
received from a chemistry tutor.
She was also happy, at first, with
the assistance she got from a
math tutor. However, the tutor

”The service ‘is convenient,”

times, it's hard to get onethat will

" Yuna said that this type of thing 

sometimes happens the first time
the tutor and the athlete are sup-
posed to meet because they are
unfamiliar with each other. He
was, however, unaware that they
weren't getting together in_ their
later meetings.

”|t's not a problem that usual-
Iy happens; if it does, I will

definitely act on it. I will call the

tutor right away and try to, get
things straightened out,"

The Replacements represent
everything that's right about rock
’n’ roll. On the same album they
can go from songs that irreverent-

ly raise a middle finger to the es-'

tablishment, to tough, haunting
acoustic ballads, to charmingly
unambitious straight—ahead rock.
Their music is instantly memora-
ble and played with so much feel-
ing that it sounds absolutely vital,
no matter what the subject.
The band's beginnings were
quite inauspicious. Initially a loud
bunch of kids banging out
early-'80s punk in a Minneapolis
warehouse, The Replacements
quickly earned a reputation for
playing -and living fast. Their
shows were often drunken revel-

.3 ries of bad covers and ”so what”

attitudes; their albums were oc-
casionally remarkable testaments

to young suburban American
angst.

It didn't take long, though, for
singer and principle songwriter
Paul Westerberg to expand be-
yond his gutsy noise—rock an-
thems. Slower, often romantic
songs began appearing on LPs.
Though ”Within Your Reach,”
”Androgynous” and ’’If Only
You Were Lonely” never became
staples of the band's raucous live
shows, they showed healthy signs
of growth.

Finally, The Replacements
signed on with Sire Records, and
the band's inevitable ascent into
a wider rock ’n’ roll conscious-
ness came rapidly. While some of
the sloppy punk trimmings were
swept away, Westerberg’s lyrical
focus sharpened and his ear for
hooks continued to improve. The

predicted sellout never came; the
records just kept getting better.

Four young hippies dressed in
black, banging out an extremely
(at times) heavy-duty jam was the
last thing I expected to see on the
Grammy Awards. But after the
boredom I had experienced
through most of the evening,
Metallica’s performance was
definitely one of the highlights.

in the new" Hard Rock/Metal
category, but somehow classic-
rock dinosaur Jethro Tull won the

award amidst boos from Metalli-
ca fans. Still, this was, at the very
least, a media victory for
Metallica.

Not long ago, Metallica

couldn't even get radio or video-
play, let alone a Grammy perfor-‘

mance. However, thanks mainly
to word of mouth, their popular-
ity has grown to such great
proportions that their latest al-

already sold over one million
copies. , _

Addiction’s first video to appear
on MTV, is quite a contoversial
spectacle. But then again, Jane's
Addiction are themselves a bit
controversial. It all started with a
drug addict named Jane.

A little over three years ago,
lead vocalist Perry Farrell shared
an eight-room house with Jane
and eleven roommates. Perry's
band, PSI-COM, had just fallen
apart. Jane knew that Perry was
looking for musicians to form a
new band, so she introduced him
to her friend, bassist Eric Avery.

Withtheir meeting, the seeds
of Jane's Addiction were sown.
Avery and Farrell had an immedi-
ate connection and began writing
songs. They played with other
members a few times, but the
lineup soon became solid when
David Navarro (guitar) and
Stephen Perkins (drums) joined.

Jane's Addiction’s popularity
grew quickly. Within a year after
they formed, they were voted
L.A’.’s best Metalffhrash band in
sexleral polls. They signed to, an

‘independent label, Triple X

Relcords, and put out their self-
titled debut.

’ The Replacements should

This live album contained a
wide variety of material. There
were heavy—duty punk jams such
as ”Trip Away,” lolky songs like
"My Time," and covers of the
Velvet Undergrountl and the
Rolling Stones. lThey also do
covers by X, Joy Division and the
Doors.)

At this point, the major record
companies started their bidding
wars. Jane's Addiction was court-
ed by just about every major
label, but decided to go with
Warner Brothers because it
guaranteed artistic the band and
creative control. However, this
control has caused controversy a
couple of times, starting with
their first national release.

Jane's Addiction’s Nothing’s

stores in August. Seven major
retailers actually banned the al-
bum because of its shocking
cover: naked Siamese twin wom-
en with their hair on fire.

The retailers called the covers

”ls there something to do?”

Those who don't associate that
common phrase with a Depeche
Mode song may instead identify
with their own weekend situa-
tion. Choices: you could go to a
party and drink yourself sense-
less; you could go to a bar, see
a lame cover band and drink
yourself senseless; or you could
even hit the pulsating dance floor
and drink yourself senseless.

Now, tliere’s an alterriativr= —
the Sonir Temple. At this new
performan('e spare in Wilkins-
burg, the rniisir and art are what
matters, not the boo/e. That's
why the Temple is opening
tomorrow with a show featuring
five lotal bands and the release
party for a (asselle rompilation
called Art Now.’ containing
twelve Pittsliurgli groups.

/-\fter that, the spat e, loraterl in
a former Masonir temple (hence
the name), will play host to
seveiiteen national arts in the
month of March alone.

llowever, the Sonic Temple
won't be programming only niLis—

N

ic. Plans are being made for an
art gallery, a record store, a film
series, and even theater and
dance productions. Regular col-
laborations with the Mattress Fac-
tory, the Wilkinsburg Arts
Council, and other community
arts groups may come to fruition.

This mighty bastion of indepen-
dent music and art didn't just pop
out of nowhere. Rather, it's the
end result of triumphs achieved

' and mistal<es made over the past

two years at places such as the
Squirrel Ilill American Legion,
the Wightman School, the Foun-
dry, and Carnegie Mellon
llniversity.

Skirmislies with authority at the
legion and the Foundry proved
that uridergrouiid music had to
lie above ground when it came
to legal matters. The Wightman
experienre showed that an au-
tlIt‘t)((' for more experimental
iiiusical forms existed in Pitts-
burgh; it just needed more culti-
vation. ‘

Finally, successful shows at
CMU such as Winterblast, New-

GI Fl C

e s p a c e
fest and Gothic Rock attracted
large audiences, but were few
and far between. The question
seemed to be —- could it be done
all the time?

Mark Choi, Manny Theiner,
and Brian Welcker, managers of
the Sonic Temple, believe the an-
swer is yes. From the rock
mastery of Government Issue and
Ignition, to the performance art of
Etant Donnes and Batz Without
Flesh, to the folkartistry of Roger
Manning and Giant Sand, they've
got all angles covered. And they
don't forget to include all the
good local bands in the process.

The key to success is usually
”practice, practice,” but for the
Sonic Temple it’s ”promote, pro-
mote.” Only the support of the
three alternative radio stations
and the progressive local print
media can spread the word about

the Temple. And only a commit-
ted and open—minded audience

I can help this latest and greatest

effort become a crucial part of
Pittsburgh's cultural resources.

posure. Their Grammy nom-
ination also means that those in
the music industry are taking no-
tice. Indeed, after eight years, it
looks like Metallica has actually
”made it” to national popularity.

Metallica was formed in I981
by James Hetfield (vocals, guitar)

and Lars Ulrich (drums) in Los
Angeles. Bassist Cliff Burton soon
joined the fold. In early 1983, the
band relocated to New York and
their lineup became solid when
lightning fast guitarist Kirk Ham-
met joined. replacing Dave Mus-
taine (now with Megadeth).
Metallica was soon signed by

Megaforce, an independent label,
and released their debut LP,
Ki/I’em All. (1983). It was an all-
out speed metal/hardcore on-
slaught and sold well for an in-
dependent release.

In 1984, Metallica’s second al-

bum, the more polished Ride the
ljghtriing, appeared on

Eastside High
was a

training ground
for jail.

Then Joe Clark
took over.

Now the kids
are getting
something they
never had.

A future.

Megatorce. The band's populari-
ty grew "steadily, and Elektra
Records soon came calling.

Elektra picked up’ Ride the
Lightning and distributed it. All
this time, Metallica had been
playing small clubs and theaters.
This would change with the
release of Master of Puppets in
I986.

Master of Puppets showed an
increased use of dynamics. The
songs not only sped up, but oc-
casionally slowed down. Neo-
classical guitar and more tradi-
tional hard rock elements were

fused with the staccato machine

gun bursts of guitars, bass, and
drums, characteristic of the speed
metal approach.

This album was the first really
successful speed metal album
and even made it into the Bill-
board top 30. It sold thanks to
word of mouth and a six-month
tour with Ozzy Osbourne.

After the very successful Ozzy
tour, tragedy struck while the
band was touring Europe. In
Scandinavia, their tour bus ran off

stunned band knew, howeverpei‘

' that they wanted to carry on.

Auditions were held to find a
”young and hungry” bass player.
Eventually Jason Newstead, form-
erly the primary songwriter of
Flotsam & Jetsam, joined Metal-
lica. Jason's first album with
Metallica was The $5.98 EP:
Garage Days Re-Revi5ited. ‘

This was a five—song EP of cover

versions of oldisongs by such un- 

derground bands as the Misfits.
The album was put out mainly for
fun, but also to ease Jason
Newstead in with fans. It was a
minor chart success and led to a
spot on this summer's Monsters
of Rock tour.

This brings us to the release of

By John Young
Staff Writer

He had a party, he had a band
And a thousand loving friends,
He had his reasons or so he said

—— this should be where the story
ends...

But it doesn't. The story is from
"Ron Klaus Wrecked His
House,” by Boston band Big Dip-
per, and it’s one of the most in-
fectious pieces of quirky pop rock

in recent memory.

By the time the chorus swells,
the damage is done; Ron Klaus’
pad lies in ruin and anyone listen-
ing is bound to be singing the
song over and over for weeks.
”Ron Klaus Wrecked His

burn. it has even made its way
into MTV’s normal rotation
(which means it is being shown
several times a day).

Radio has also taken notice, as
college stations, as well as AOR
stations, are playing the song‘.

”One” is the true story of a war
veteran who stepped on a land
mine and lost hisiappendages,
eyesight, hearing, and ability to
speak. The lyrics are written from
the veteran's perspective. He is
the victim, screaming inside fo_r
a new life or a welcome death.
(The real man did partially com-

municate through morse code.)
Most of the album is written

from this standpoint. The title.it-
self, And/ustice for All..., echoes -

this lyrical direction; reflecting on
being the victim and wanting
some type of revenge or solace.
James Hetfield’s lyrics are amaz-
ingly blunt, realistic, and some-
times moving. You can feel the
pain and anger and identify with
it.

The music on the album is
equally as powerful. Dynamics
are used again, creating tension
and energy. The band's impres-
sive musical ability is showcased

  

to the maximum as each song
features intricate chord and riff
changes. These guys definitely
know more than three chords.

I Metallica will appear at the
Civic Arena on March 4. Queens-
ryche, now on_ tour supporting
their Operation: Mind Crime al-
bum, will be the opening act.

House,” is indicative of a tar larg-
er catalog of songs from one of
the freshest-sounding, genuinely
fun bands working.

Its members hailing from such
legendary bands of the under-
ground as the Volcano Suns, the
Embarrassment and Dumptruck,
Big Dipper has forged some
unique musical territory. The gui-
tars play in fits ofdistortion, punk
rock mayhem, then chime with
sunny pop melodies.

The voices of Bill Goffrier and
Cary Waleik fuse into a great har-
monic wail. The whole band
swings with the sound of loose,
smart playing. This is pop as only
Big Dipper could play it.

Lyrically, the band comes from
different perspectives, most v of
them unabashedly silly. They

remember ”When Men Were
Trains” (though it's a cover). They
tell a gal ”She’s Fetching,” and
they chant that for ”A Song To Be
Beautiful,” the artist must be
brave.

Plus, these guys are great
storytellers, as evidenced by
"Ron Klaus,” ”Wet Weekend,"
or ”Bonnie.” With the emotion-
al straightforwardness of Jonathan
Richman and an eye for the odd,
not unlike Stan Ridgway’s, Big
Dipper’s songs make some
strange and wonderful lyrical
iourneys.

Have the time of your life and
see Big Dipper live, Monday
night at The Decade. They've had
an album reviewed in People
magazine, so you know they
must be destined for stardom.

an up-and—down season and are
not yet assured of making the
NCAA Tournament. Many think
they have to beat Connecticut,
then win at least one game in the
Big East tourney to get an NCAA
bid. The Panthers are 15-11, 8-7
and in fourth place in the con-
ference.

Pitt's starting guard tandem of
Jason Matthews and Sean Miller
complement each other well on
the court. But for Pitt to do what
it is capable of, center Bobby
Martin and forward Brian Short-
er will be under a lot of pressure
to produce. They have been do-
ing it all season, so there is no
reason to think that they would
stop now.

The road ahead is a tough one.
If things remain the same, Pitt
would play the Providence Friars
in the first round of the Big East,
a team they were swept by in the
regular season. Beating a team
three times in one season is a

   

  
   
   
 
 
   
  
       
       
    
     
   
    
   
   
 
   
   
   

tough thing to do, but if anybody
can do it, the Friars can.

Their bench is very deep and
Coach Rick Barnes can substitute
almost at will. Pitt, on the other
hand, has played only six players
extensively this season. Provi-
dence has a lot of fouls to give
and is just as good with any
lineup on the floor. They could
give the Panthers fits.

If Pitt can get by the Friars, they
will probably play Georgetown,
unless, of course, the Hoyas are
upset by the winner of the eight-
nine game (probably St. John's
against Boston College) that takes
place Thursday night.

Georgetown and Pitt match up
well. They can run with the
Hoyas and counteract any type of
substitution they put in. The key
for Pitt will be the play of the
Martin, Shorter and forward Rod
Brookin. if they can control the

inside play and make their shots,
the Panthers could make it to the

championship.

Seton Hall (second place) and
Syracuse (third) will be the
favorites to face each other in
Saturday's second semi-final
game. This wou|d-be a good
game. Both teams are ranked in
the top 20 and should make
some waves in the NCA/\s. They
match up against each other, but
Syracuse’s experience in tourna-
ment games could pull it out.

Point guard Sherman Douglas
(who became the NCAA’s all-
time leader in assists against
Providence Tuesday night), for-
wards Derrick Coleman and
Stephen Thompson are players
that Seton Hall will have to
control. _

The Pirates aren't that shabby

a team, though. Seniors John
Morton and Ramon Ramos can

play with anyone in the country

when they are having a good
night. They have seen the team
go trom last—place to second in
their tour years and are going to
want to prove that the Hall is a
team to watch out for. They can
beat Syracuse and will be a sur-
prise in the tinals.

Now if the Panthers were to
pull otf two wins and gain a final
shot, Seton Hall could be the
toughest game of the weekend.
Pitt has beaten the Pirates twice

this season, and the Panthers

have the ability to beat them
again.

If the game Saturday goes ac-
cording to schedule, the Panthers
should be heading into the tour-
nament on a high note. Once
they are there, anything .can
happen. '

Oh. yes you can. Some girls ean have
