On Having Honors Code

tests. Some put students in
every other seat of every

“Propaganda in Comics”

by FRANK ALTMAN

Little Orphan Annie along
with Daddy Warbucks, Phil
D. Bluster, Spike Spangle,
and Joe Palooka were featur-
ed last Thursday in a lecture
by Dr. James A. Kehl, dean
of the School of Liberal Arts.

Speaking on “Propaganda in
Comic Strips,” Dean Kehl ex-
pressed the view that there are
many attempts at indoctrination
in the comics. For example dur-
ing World War II Joe Palooka
sold war bonds and visited blood’
banks. At the same time many
detective comics switched from
the “cops and robbers” type plot
to espionage.

During the 1930’s “Buck Rod-
gers” anticipated Cape Kennedy,
While “Terry and the Pirates”
with Chopstick Joe gave many
Americans their ﬁrst impression
of the Far East. Thus Dean Kehl
contends that some of our atti-
tudes and ideas come from no
more reputable sources than com-

Concentrating on “Little Or-
phan Annie,” Dean Kehl char-
acterized Annie as the rugged in-
dividualist and Daddy Warbucks
as the self-made capitalist. Dean
Kehl contended that the comic

strip favored private enterprise
and rejected any kind of govern-
ment centralization that threaten-
ed a free capitalism.

In particular, the comic strip
opposed the New Deal, remarked
Kehl, and we can even “folloW
the New Deal by following the
comic.” For example when in-
come taxes were introduced Dad-
dy Warbucks is seen falling prey
to Phil 0. Bluster, a corrupt po-
litican who tries to railroad Dad-
dy on charges of income tax in-
vasion.

MDC To Conduct Fund Drive;  
Dorm Weekend Plans

Announces

Men’s Dormitory Council
(MDC) has joined the call
for a new Student Union
with the passage of a bill to
conduct a fund raising drive
to help ﬁnance the construc-
tion of a new student center. It has
also announced preliminary plans
for Dorm Weekend.

The Student Union bill, passed
at the last MDC meeting of the
term, Thursday, “is based on the
fact that a new Student Union
will be built in the near future
and that the chancellor has giv-
en his approval to such fund
raising drives,” explained Tom
Meisner, president of MDC. “Ac-
tually,” admitted Meisner, “the
purpose of the bill is not so much
to raise large sums of money but
to show our (MDC’s) support and

interest in building a new Stu-
dent Union.” The drive will be
conducted next term, but no
other details are available now,
stated Meisner.

The plans for Dorm Weekend,
which will be held for the ﬁrst
time Feb. 23, 24, and 25, were
announced by Wayne Masterman,
overall chairman of the weekend.
A contract has been signed for a
Saturday nightvconcert with the
Lettermen. The concert will be
held in Carnegie Music Hall.
Thursday during Dorm Weekend,
there will be an evening of com-
petition and games between the
dorm houses. A dinner-dance is
scheduled for Friday night. Tick-
cts for the weekend will be avail-
able only to male, undergraduate
dormitory residents.

During the meeting, Panther
and Sutherland Houses also pre-
sented MDC with a huge “Beat
Penn State” banner. Thebanner
is about six feet wide and 150
feet long. “(hen it was hung from
the top .of.'_'l‘ower B, it reached

 

the ﬁfth ﬂoor. Meisner noted that
“a lot of credit should go to the
two houses for doing something
so unique." He praised the ban-
ner as an “excellent example of
how the house system can work.”

Meisner announced that at the
ﬁrst meeting of“next trimester, a
bill to establish a Judicial.Board
would be introduced to the Sen-
ate. Work on this Board has been
going on since March. It will be
composed of ﬁve students and
will have jurisdiction over under-
graduate men living in the dorms.

Dean Kehl Analyzes Symbols  

Things got so bad for capital-
ism, says Kehl, that Daddy War-
bucks, the symbol of private en-
terprise, contracted -a disease dur-'-
ing World War II and died. Eight
months later Daddy reappeared,
however, when F.D.R. and ‘the
New Deal‘died; capitalism could
be reborn. ‘

Little Orphan-Annie had such
a great effect on the American
people, commented the Dean,
that the Daily Worker was forced
to publish comics for the ﬁrst
time. in its history. The Daily
Worker produced _“Little Lefty”
and her dog Spunky.

Although her popularity had
fallen off, Little Annie hasn’t lost
her .punch. Recently she Warrant-
ed front page editorials after she

The purpose of distributing the

net member in charge of investi-f_
gating the possibilities of an Hon-:_,
ors Code, is to “provide a broad:
base of student support” for the
code. “We could have gone straight‘
to the faculty or adniinistrationff
continued Popkave, “but it is best-
to let students have some-say‘ in
the direction of University poli-'-fl
cy.” ..

The proposed‘ code would

effect at the service acadennies,
Dartmouth College, Yale, Michi-
gan, Virginia, and Princeton. Ac. 3:
cording to Tom Sachs, chairman ‘
of the Cabinet, these schools have
a code providing for student 
porting of cheating. Cases are
taken before a student tribunal
which makes judgments. The sis»: .

schools where it is in force that,t9
says Sachs’, students actually 'd'o1—

Popkave commented that the

Student’s Ideals Alike
In Europe and America 

by PHIL STOLLER

“Through my experiences, I have found that European .

and American students basically cling to the same ideals,”-
maintained Father Andre Scheuer, professor at Duquesne,
University. Speaking Friday night at the Crumbling Wall
coffee house, he continued, “However the American student?
is less radical and more theoretical in supporting his idea1s.’»’;

Emphasizng the importance of
student thought, Father Scheuer

. stated, “The opinions of students

represent the hidden forces of so-

_ciety. The student is loyal to a

cause, self-sacriﬁcing, critical, and
rebellious in a liberal nature. Stu-
dent thought,” he continued, “is
also important in that it is in
tone with our changing times.”
Father Scheuer emphasized that
we are in a period of transition
——of changing values. Because of
these changing values, the stu-
dent is in the midst of the
change.

Charterizing the European stu-
dent, Father Scheuer listed a
number of traits: “I believe
that the European student is an-
ti-traditionalistic. He believes that
which is good is that which is
new. In Europe, an appeal to tra-
dition is not a very inﬂuential
argument.

“The European student emo-
tionally rejects any type of au-
according to Father
Scheuer. “The student in Eur-
ope,”. he decried, “looks to those
individuals who defend values

- and maintain the status-quo with’,

    
 
 
   
   
   
  
  
 
 
   
   
 
   
   
  
 
   
  

’ a great deal of mistrust and cons
fusion.” ,
In explaining the students con-
demnation of the older genera-
tion, Father Scheuer referred td
Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye and
Golding’s Lord of the Flies. 
cording to the Father, Salinger’s_
book represents a condemnation
of the established society. It re‘-:
veals how a students education
introduces him into an establish-
ed society and how the student
re_jects the “corruption” of his ed-
.ucation. Father Scheuer contend-
ed that Golding’s book “also rep-
resented a condemnation of so-
ciety but in a more sophisticated
manner.” 4
“The ﬁnal element of the stu-,
dent mind,” proclaimed Father.
Scheuer, “is a degree of anti-
formalism.” The student wants:
to be free to engage himself in.‘
a society without regard tothe’-:
established norms. Father Scheuer ‘
concluded, “This is the reason
why the student dresses, rebel-C
liously, behaves without . regard-
ing respect, and totally rebels;
againstsocial ethics. .

-Black Power

' “MOVE ON over, or we’ll
move on over you,” is the re-
frain from one of Stokely
’Carmichael’s Black Panther
Party anthems. This type of
black-racist song, and the
man who sings it, areobjec-
-tionable to many of the so-
called “white liberals” in
America. ‘
During a recent interview
. on the David Susskind Show,
 Carmichael was asked if he
thought he should change
*”tl1e "Black Power” termino-
logy because it is frighten-
fing away too many.well-in-
tentioned people.’ Carmich-
lael answered that SNCC is
"not responsible for the bad
‘publicity it gets. SNCC is
-concerned with the Negroes’
_problems and its aim is “to
"unify Negroes so that they
"nay regain the power that
has been disenfranchised
‘from them.”
_ The stated purpose seems
.to be a noble one, especially
with a non-violent approach.
'It is the non-concern with
(‘publicity that is alarming. If
. Carmichael is really interest-
;ed in changing the bigoted
ttitudes of white. people,
good publicity should be of

—.-

V-utmost concern to him.

-“Burn, baby, burn,” Black
Power, and “We’ll move on
ver you” are the worst kind
of publicity that he could
ossibly get. Through bad
Jublicity, Carmichael and the
Student Non-Violent Coordi-
Tfnating Committee (SNCC)

have come to be synonomous
with violence.

STOKELY Carmichael’s ac-
ions and words seem to hurt
he Civil Rights Movement
more than they help. White
cceptance of Negroes, con-
trary to Carmichael, will be
gradual process that will
‘stake many years. This is not
-0 say that we should sit
ack and wait for the rain-
’. how. We must take well-
lanned and thoughtful steps
ﬁowards the goal. Dr. King’s
using agreement in Chica-
o, for example, is one step

The 50th anniversary of Omicron Delta Kappa (ODK), national lead-
ership honorary for junior and senior men, will witness this evening the
_ induction of 14 “student leaders” into the University’s chapter. The stu-
 dents chosen for this honor admittedly represent “one of the most diverse
and representative groups to be selected in recent years,” as attested to
" by Chapter President William Cabin. Any they more than adequately meet
the qualifications for membership, which include a significant contribution
' in one major and two minor activity areas. ‘
if C We appreciate that ODK is an “elite” organization, and although
all men in the upper 35 per cent of their class are eligible for tapping, only
Fa small percentage actually qualify. What we lament is that this num-
ber is so minute compared to those technically eligible. The men chosen
this year demonstrate once again by their list of -activities that they are
for the most part assuming leadership roles in several organizations. They
are to be congratulated for their service, but this in no way justifies the

Our campus abounds in extracurricular activities designed to meet
the diverse interests of a university population, yet the students avail
themselves to the opportunities open to them. They are guilty of the
same crime committed by the armchair politician——they verbally espouse
their views and criticisms yet seldom if ever act. Occasionally, they’ll ‘
write a letter to the editor. And they freely discuss their pet peeves and
proposed solutions to particular University problems among their own cir-
cle of friends. But the next step-—contributing towardsfa constructive

directorates of SNCC and

CORE, Carmichael said that
Negroes must learn that they
cannot depend on white peo-
ple helping them. “By seeing
only Negroes in positions of

authority, Negroes will learn ‘

that blacks, too, can become
powerful.” Carmichael’s rea-
soning here is fallacious.
White people will always be
in power in America simply
because there are more
whites than blacks. The
white man is not trying to
gain the acceptance in the
Negro Community, Negroes
must gain acceptance to the
White Community. Being ex-
posed to friendly white peo-
ple in Negro organizations
will help the Negro-adjust
to‘ the white power structure
In our society.

IF CARMICHAEL’S atti-
tude were carried to the ex-
treme, the Hill Education
Project would accept only
Negro tutors because being
exposed to intelligent white
people might convince the
Negro children that only
whites may become educated.
How ridiculous this would
be!

If the Civil Rights Move-
ment is to progress in 1967,
Carmichael and the other
Black Power advocates must
soon realize that they are
doing the cause more harm
than good. With each Molo-
tov cocktail, with each black-
racist song, with each public
appearance of Stokely Car-

michael, the “someday” in.

“We Shall Overcome” seems
further away than ever.

Letters to the Editor  

Advisor Blasts
Elevator System

Editor, Pitt News: ,

I would like to relate an inter-
esting incident that took place in
the Cathedral recently:

It does not seem to me like

such a problem to go from the -

School of" Liberal Arts, on the
ninth floor, to the Political Sci-
ence Department on the 23rd.
Knowing that there is such a
thing as a LOCAL elevator and
such a thing as. an EXPRESS ele-
vator, I knew that to get to 23
and and back would take four
elevators. From the ninth ﬂoor,
I took a LOCAL to 18 where‘ I
waited patiently for an E}G’RESS
After the appropriate time lapse,
the EXPRESS deposited me on
the 24th ﬂoor.

I then walked to 23 and the Po-
litical Science Department. From
the 23rd ﬂoor, I again waited on
the 24th for an EXPRESS to take
me to 18. From the 18th ﬂoor I
caught an elevator that does not
stop on the ninth ﬂoor. I rode to
the ground ﬂoor, got out of this
elevator, waited seven minutes
until there was room on a LO-

CAL and ﬁnally was able to re- ,

‘turn to the ninth ﬂoor. This pro-
cedure took 25 minutes.

I realize that not all of the
elevators can stop at every ﬂoor,
but it seems rather ridiculous to
me not to have an elevator stop
at the designated ﬂoor‘when it‘
is coming down. This would not
only save the time of the pass-
enger, but also the time of the
operator. It might even out the
number of people who wait on
the ground and ﬁrst ﬂoors.

If there is a sane and logical
answer for the present system,
someone please let me, Pitt News,
and several thousand other peo-
ple know!

*-.,, Playing its second South-
ern Conference opponent in
three days, the Panther bas-
ketball team ( 1-1) hosts William
: & Mary (0-2) tonight at 8:15 at

_ the Field House.

The cagers had little chance
against Davidson Saturday night.
The Wildcats were simply too
big, too fast, and too numerous.

The 97-59 ﬁnal score is a little
bit misleading, however. The
cagers played Davidson even for
the ﬁrst ten minutes of the game,
leading 14-12 at one point, and
trailing 18-17 at another.

But then -everything on the court
broke loose. The Panthers tried
to run and shoot with the Wild-
cats, something that just isn’t
done with an explosive team. As
5. result, Davidson outscored the
cagers 25-4 during a frantic stretch
and walked otf at halftime with
a commanding 47-28 advantage.

Surprisingly, it was poor shoot-

the Panthers. “They’re about our
size,” he said. “Their top scorer,
Ben-Pomeroy, goes six-ﬁve or six-
six. He5s slightly taller than A1
DeFrischia.
“On offense,” he continued,
“they tend to look for him while
‘ their guards are dribbling the
ball around. Dribbling is some-
thing they like to do.” Pomeroy
hit for 18 points against WVU,
playing the entire 40 minutes.
“They only use six or seven
men,” Grgurich added.

William & Mary faces the same
predicament. Their top guard,
Dave Walker, hurt his leg against
West Virginia Saturday night,
and he’s also a doubtful starter
tonight.

ing rather than poor rebounding
that caused the Panthers’ down-
fall. Davidson only had ten more
rebounds for the entire game, 59-
49. But the Wildcats shot 38 of
77, or nearly 50 per cent, ‘while
the cagers could do no better
than 19 of 78, less than 25 per
cent.

Sophomore Wayne Huckel spark-
ed Davidson with 18 points. Six-
nine pivotman Rod Knowles con-
tributed 17 points and 16 re-
bounds. ‘

Ken Bollens’ 16 points was the
Panther high, as was his 12 re-
bounds. Len Kalata and Stan Fal-
cnski each scored 13.

“Their big men killed us,” said

The Mountaineers won that
game, 73-67, but they did it with
a 21-7 -spurt after Walker had
fouled out. The Colonials had led
at halftime, 40-36.

Tim Grgurich scouted William

The Cubs enter the contest
fresh off a convincing 87-49 vic-

frosh led from the start, opening
up an 11 point spread before
Tech got on the scoreboard, and
rolling to a 30 point margin at

THE ISSUE:

"1 DON'T WANT TO GET LOST IN THE CROWD.”

Dear Mr. Byman:.

There’s a wide gulf separating your ideas
about business and mine. Let’s try and bridge
it.

I see business as offering those very things-
individuality, recognition, and personal satis-
faction—that you imply it lacks. In fact, be-
fore beginning this discussion with you, if
you had asked me to pinpoint the advantages
of a business career, I would have mentioned

_ these same three basic items. I would have

done so automatically—out of personal con-

. viction and experience.

Obviously, some others do not share my con-
viction-. In one form or another, this issue has
been raised by each student participating in
these dialogues. I’m puzzled and I'm worried.

‘I’ve read some of the grey ﬂannel novels, seen

some of the “big-business” movies. I've seen
what some responsible journalists and sociol-
ogists have to say—men like William Whyte

. and C. Wright Mills.

I These analyzers and observers make some

valid points—-business isn’t perfect, no ele-
ment of our society is. What concerns me is
the over—emphasis on the imperfections of

V business. The fact that similar studies of or-

ganization life in big labor, big government,
and big education haven’t produced similar
conclusions.

I’m not suggesting that business embark on
a “you’re one too” kind of campaign. That
would be a pale defense. I am suggesting that
we businessmen must stop taking things for
granted and do a little better job in demon-
strating the opportunities for individuality,
recognition, and satisfaction in business.

You and your fellow students should be con-
cerned about “getting lost.” We live in a com-
plex society where technical advances tend
to outrun social advances. At» the moment, it
may be easier to produce thinking machines
than thinking men. We also live a world that’s
beginning to feelthe effects of explosive pop-
ulation growth—our cities are becoming over-
crowded, so are our highways, schools, and
colleges. One result—more systems, more
controls, more regulations. For the individ-

'ual, a feeling of being hemmed in; of being

powerless.

I It's a problem that concerns men everywhere.

You’re asking about what happens to individ-
uality in a large corporation. Many of us are
asking what happens to the computer-carded
students at our over-crowded colleges and
universities.

~ Actually, it's easier for a business to do some-

thing about the problems associated with big-
ness than any other type organization. For
example, in the last decade Motorola has un-
dergone a three-fold expansion—in terms of

QQMy generation is seeking individu-

ality, recognition, and personal satisfac-
tion —and my conception of ‘the

corporate crowd’ is Very frightening.99

——Robert Byman, University of Illinois

TELLING IT LIKE IT IS

This is the fourth round in an exchange of ideas and opin-
ions between Robert W. Calvin, Motorola Chairman, and
Bob Byman, University of Illinois student. The subject:
business. What do college students think about the busi-
ness world? How does it measure up to other career
choices? What are its strengths. and weaknesses?

Mr. Calvin’s words answer one of the many issues raised by
Mr. Byman in a letter carried in this paper. Shortly, Mr. By-
man will have an opportunity to rebut and the dialogue
will continue as long as there are informative points to
be made.

This and 5 other dialogues are appearing regularly in col-
lege papers throughout the country. '

products and people. However, as we've
grown in size, we’ve maintained the concept
of individual responsibility. Fortunately, the
bigger a company becomes, the more it has to
decentralize. Create smaller, autonomous
units;\look for more efficient ways of doing
things; recognize and reward those who make
meaningful decisions at every level in the
corporate structure; adapt to new technol-
ogies and markets. This type of structure is
tailor-made for the individual who wants rec-
ognition, the individual who wants to make
his mark. It makes his job more satisfying.

If these or similar steps aren’t taken, you’re
right, bigness can swallow an individual.

This isn’t a secret known only to Motorola.
Most large companies know the same facts
of life and are doing something about them.
Other segments_ ofour society are also coming
to grips with this need——most are turning to
business to show them a way out of their
organizational difficulties.

For example. Faced with the growing com-
plexities of medical care and record keeping
plus an increase in patient load, the Mayo
Clinic recently called in Lockheed Aircraft to
develop an automated, computer system to
support almost every phase of patient care
—admission, diagnosis, treatment, and
follow-up. Thus, freeing the clinic staff for
more personalized services. There are many
similar cases.

Business couldn’t meet this kind of challenge
from its customers if it didn’t put a high pre-
mium on individuality. On hiring young men
with ideas. Men who aren’t afraid to question
the obvious and the obsolete‘, and back up
their words with positive suggestions for
change’. Men who want recognition and who
will stand up and becounted; This is not the
kind of environment where a man can get lost
~—-unless he wants to.

This year, Professor Peter Drucker wrote an-

"introduction to a study of more than 1,.000
executives, age 30 to 45. With admitted sur-
prise, he pointed out: “There is not one. organi-
zation man in the lot. No one works for a com-
puter, though a good many have computers
working for them. No one sees the need to
conformilet alone the urge to do so.” Prac-
tically all of the men attributed much of their
success to their ability to show management
new ways of doing things.

There’s more to be said about what a young
man can expect from business, and I’d like to
return to this subject in my next letter.
