The Pitt News

Headlines throughout the
year shouted about resigna-
tions, but an engineering
major who was walking a
friend home one muggy July
night truly grabbed Pitt’s
attention.

So as students prepare to
close out the year with
finals, The Pitt News pre-
sents its year in review.

Kevin Cecil was‘ shot in
the back of the neck July 21
and will likely be a quadri-
plegic for the rest of his life.
The shooting was the first
of many events to rock the
campus this year; a local bar
that was an underage drink-
ing haven closed down, the
City Council agreed to close
a street and Pitt closed
down the Zeta Beta Tau fra-
ternity.

But, besides the closings,
Pitt’s board of trustees
named an interim chancel-

But as the summer winded
down, tragedy hit Oakland.
Cecil, 21, was walking a

when a 13-year -ld, a 17-

allegedly shot him in the

Suspected

Seeking to bridge cultural
barriers and to assist with
Russia’s under-funded
women’s health-care system,
seven Pitt students will travel
this coming May to Moscow
to volunteer for the Magee
Womancare International
Project at Savior’s Hospital.

The seven students, four of
whom participated last year,
will be volunteering their
time at the newly erected
Birth House at Savior’s
Hospital.

The Birth House acts as a

“Last year, we worked with
the unwanted children from
infants up to about 12 years
old. We played with them and
also brought them toys,” said
Elizabeth Weber, who is
going her on second trip to
Russia.

The groups plan to continue
last year’s efforts of educa-
tion. They spread awareness
of birth control in high
schools and taught English,
not only to the students, but to
the doctors and nurses as
well.

A group known as the
International Church of Christ,
which is reportedly planning a
major recruiting campaign on
Pitt’s campus next year, has
been accused of being a cult by
local religious organizations.

No members or representa-
tives of the International
Church of Christ could be
reached for comment, but sev-
eral students who have been
approached by recruiters from
the ICOC have a lot to say

- about them.

“I think it is very important
that students are warned about
the dangers of this organiza-
tion,” said Pitt sophomore
Anthony Dragani.

Dragani said he was pursued
by members of the ICOC, and
Paul Troth, a former panicipant
in the group, said that the orga-
nization uses “brainwashing”

methods to control new mem- . . -
‘ bers. _

“The ICOC pulls in young
college students, and, through
extensive Bible studies which
can last hours and hours, con-
vince the new recruit that the
Bible is the infallible word of
God,” Troth said.‘ “Once that is
established and the new recruit
is convinced, they will tell you
to do things and try to justify it
with twisted and convoluted
interpretations from that boo .”

Dragani and Troth said that
the group masquerades as a
Christian organization and that
it is not the belief system of the
organization that is the problem.

Costume designer
doubles as a student

By Lisa Williams
For The Pitt News

For Pitt student Tracey Reed, an interest in clothes came at a

young age.

“I remember making, when I was little, handmade clothes for
my dolls,” Reed said. “I used needle and thread and taught

myself.”

Reed is the costume designer for the current Pitt Theatre pro-
duction, “The School For Scandal.”

Reed said she has been interested in art since elementary
school, and her interest in fashion began developing as early as

middle school.

Reed, originally from Philadelphia. currently lives in
Shadyside with her two children. She is a single mom as well

as a second-year graduate student here at Pitt.

Reed said she wants single mothers to know that they can

accomplish their goals. She said that her son and daughter.

served as the motivation for pursuing her education.

KUALA LUMPUR,
Malaysia — Two decades
after the fall of Saigon, the
biggest flood of Vietnamese
boat people in years is under
way. But this time the ﬂow is
being reversed, as refugee
camps around Southeast Asia
begin closing down and tens
of thousands of asylum—seek-
ers are sent back to the country
from wnich they ﬂed.

The United Nations agreed
at an international meeting last
month to cut off financing for
the camps on June 30. The
people who remain in the
camps are no longer eligible
for resettlement, and officials
say the only option for the
Vietnamese now is to go home

JERUSALEM —- The United
States, working to broker a
new cease-fire agreement in
southern Lebanon, handed the
Lebanese government an ini-
tial proposal that reportedly
called on Lebanon and Syria
to disarm Hezbollah guerillas
in exchange for a possible

Israeli pullout from its buffer

zone in nine months.

The plan met with initial
skepticism from the Lebanese
Prime Minister, but intensive
contacts continued among
Israeli, Lebanese, Syrian and
American officials.

There was no immediate
indication of when a cease-fire
could be reached, but Israeli
officials declared that their
military operations would con-
tinue unabated in parallel with
the diplomatic efforts. The

WASHINGTON — The
White House will assert exec-
utive privilege and refuse to
give Congress a secret internal
report on President Clinton’s
1994 decision to do nothing
about weapons shipments
from Iran to Bosnian Muslims,
senior administration officials
said.

At least six Congressional
committees are contemplating
hearings on the President’s
decision. The claim of execu-
tive privilege appears likely to
provide ammunition for
Clinton’s opponents in the
1996 presidential election.

of Pitt students and administrators. His friend and
fellow engineering student Adam Butera and Food
Services Director Betsy Sallade-Farina led a year-
long charity drive that successfully got Cecil a
specially equipped van.

Fall

Soon after the first term started, students from
across the state gathered on the Cathedral Lawn
with Vice President Al Gore in a rally against the
proposed cuts in student aid. Gore encouraged stu-
dents to take a more active role in thefuture of

  
 

student aid, and most of the programs under con-
sideration have been saved.

Over 200 students were cited for underage
drinking at Zelda’s Greenhouse in South Oakland
one Thursday night in September. The raid was the
result of an undercover operation by the Bureau of
Liquor Control Enforcement. Zelda’s liquor
license was eventually revoked as a result of the
raid.

In October, several bottles of expired ﬂammable
chemicals discovered in‘ Clapp Hall caused classes
to be cancelled in the building and blocked Fifth

and Ruskin Avenues. All students and personnel
were evacuated from the building.

Three pledges from the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity
were charged with criminal conspiracy, criminal
trespassing and harassment after storming through
the women’s bathrooms taking snapshots of naked
women in the showers last November. ZBT has
since been expelled from campus, and their house
was recently awarded to another fraternity, Phi
Kappa Phi.

Also in November, a Pitt student was allegedly
raped on the Cathedral Lawn after leaving the
Panther Hollow Inn with her date, whom she
described as a casual acquaintance she’d met
through a campus-sponsored organization.

A few weeks later, Timothy Craddock, an 18-
year-old, who, along with four others, beat a Pitt
student into a coma on the steps of the Towers last
January, was sentenced to three to 10 years in jail.
Craddock pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and
conspiracy in addition to identifying the other
attackers.

Spring

In January, Pitt fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon was
suspended indefinitely by its national office for a
hazing incident allegedly involving new brothers
and alcohol abuse. The fraternity was later sus-
pended until April 1997 by Pitt’s Office of Student
Activities.

Over Spring Break, Pitt student John Solot com-
mitted suicide by jumping off the 35th floor of
the Cathedral of Learning.

Earlier this month, five suspects, one of which
was a current Pitt student, were arrested for a beat-
ing in a fraternity house that put two Kappa Alpha
Psi pledges in the hospital. The fraternity was sus-
pended indefinitely for hazing. The five suspects
were charged with two counts of aggravated
assault, two counts of recklessly endangering
another person and one count of criminal conspir-
acy. A trial is upcoming in Allegheny County
Common Pleas Court. . ' A .

And earlier in the week, Pitt students and admin-
istrators won a test closing of Bigelow’Bou'levar’d

after more than a month of lobbying the Pittsburgh ‘

City Council. Although the initial vote was dead-
locked, Councilwoman Valerie McDonald changed
her vote after seeing a “unified front” from Pitt
students.

“We got a really good recep-
tion in the high schools by all the
students and teachers,” Weber
said. “They really love us and
were very interested in what we
had to say.”

The state of the Russian health-
care system made the volunteers’
work invaluable. Due to the sub-
sequent lack of funding, Russian
hospitals lack necessary supplies
and sanitary conditions.

“The hospitals lack supplies
and medicine, not because they
don’t know how to use them, but
_simply because they don’t have
them,” said Weber. “With the
state that Russia’s in right now,
the supplies just are not avail-
able.”

The trip, which took over four
months of preparation, does not
intend to change the Russian
style of medicine but rather to
work with the Russians to
improve their medical practices.
One improvement in particular
that the group would like to make
concerns women’s health care.

“We are introducing new meth-

ods but still want to do it within
the Russian style of practicing,”
said Weber. “We have introduced
how to exchange ideas and how
to do things differently in order
to make them better.”

The Magee Womancare
International program has been
actively involved in the
American medical assistance and
education in woman’s health care
in Russia. It has duplicated its
family planning center at more
than 20 locations throughout
Russia.

Family planning centers
encourage education in birth con-
trol, which is helping to make the
topic more acceptable in Russian
society. Savior’s Hospital in
Moscow is the first family clinic
to have a birth house connected
to it.

To reach an expected goal of
$10,000, the students have
worked to collect donation from
area churches and other private
donations. They have received
support from the Russian Eastern
European Studies Department
and the University Honors

College.

“Food, transportation, housing
and all of our spending cash will
be paid for by the money we
raised. We raised it all from
either inside the university
or from outside donations,” sec-
ond-year volunteer Matt Brady
said.

In addition to fundraising, the
students also collected toys,
school supplies and clothing for
the students at the high school
and the children at the hospital.

Brady also expressed concern
about the future of the project
because the students participating
this year are all seniors. All
information on the trip, he said,
can be found in the Honors
College at 3500 Cathedral of
Learning.

“You have certain images of
how the Russian people are or
what the Soviet Union was like
or what Russia is like,” said
Brady, “and then you get over
there and some things are very
similar and some things are very
different. It’s something you have
to see for yourself.”

Cult
°From page 1

‘‘It’s how they use the Christian teachings to manipulate their
members,” Troth said. “They use it to control people for

‘money and power.”

Troth said that the group convinces new recruits to confess
their sins and then uses the confessions against that person.

‘These confessions can cause extreme psychological dam-
age to the individual, because everyone in the organization is
told about them,” Troth said. “You are told to confess and
describe your sins, and they even ask you about your sexual
practices. All of this is used to make the new recruit feel very
guilty and submissive to the church leaders.”

Troth said that, with this guilt and the recruits’ faith in the
ICOC leaders, they are convinced to do almost anything for
the organization. Because of this, Troth said that many of the
people who get away from the organization, including himself,
have severe psychological damage.

“Students in the organization get thrown off track of their
studies and often can’t get back on. They are persuaded to
ignore their work if it _interferes with the plans of the church
leaders,” Troth said. “People being recruited also have been
known to make rash decisions that affect their lives enormous-
ly, ﬁnancially and socially. They also come away with tremen-
dous guilt that can’t be gotten rid of, and they have to go
through hours and hours of therapy to get over it.”

Troth and Dragani said that members of the group try to trap
you so that you can’t get away from them.

“I know people who receive up to ﬁve calls a day from the
ICOC if they try to get away from them,” Dragani said. “They
just don’t want to let you go.”

Troth said that a common
practice of the group is to con-

“They get you to enter a

tact with,” Troth said. “Also,
they may decide to pick up and

Troth said.

Troth said that the group
targets students who appear
lonely or troubled, and the Cult
Awareness Network, a group
who tracks and studies cults
around the world, agrees.

A spokesperson for CAN
said that the ICOC follows the
same patterns as many cults
when recruiting new members.

“We deal with destructive
cults, which use the systematic
manipulation of a person with-
out informed consent of that
individual,” the spokesperson
said. “Cults look for people who
are troubled or lonely. They look
for people who are already reli-
gious or looking for some type
of belief to cling to.”

The spokesperson for CAN
said that students should beware
of any super-authoritative orga-
nization that tries to separate
you from your family and
ﬁiends.

“If the leaders of the ICOC
do not approve of your friends
and family, they will try to get
you to cut off all contact with
them so that the cult is the only
authority in your life,” Troth
said

“The most important thing

“I knew it had to be cos-
tumes,” Reed said. “I knew I
would do something involving
clothes.”

Reed has been designing
costumes for about a year.
During that year, she worked
as a co-designer in the theater
production “Top Girls,” assist-

ing C.T. Steele.

Most recently, she designed
the costumes for “The School
For Scandal,” written by
Richard Brinsley and directed
by Richard Keitel. The play is
an 18th-century comedy. It
runs April 9-21.

This is the first theater pro-
duction that Reed has
designed on her own. She said
that she enjoyed being a part
of both productions, but she
liked the freedom of working
more independently.

Reed said the designs
involved a lot of research and
thought. After doing the
research, she spent a lot of
time coming up with a design
concept, which
numerous readings of the
script. She said that it took her
at least six hours to design
each costume, and she
designed a total of 23.

“I had to sit back down and
read the script several times
and decide what statement the
character was trying to make,”
Reed said.

For this particular produc-
tion, the design concept was
to have a cartoony feel and
look. Therefore, Reed chose
fabrics in warm pastels and
made use of striped patterns.
She also utilized black and
white stripes in order to draw
attention to and emphasize the
more comedic characters.

“If the character ’was
comedic I could get really
crazy with it,” Reed said. “It
allowed me to accentuate that
individual by adding even
more color.”

Reed said the easiest cos-
tume to design was that of
Lady Teazle, because the
character was to be portrayed
as highly fashionable and
feminine.

“She _ was the funnest
because I could really get into

involved"

the fashion with her,” Reed
said, “because she was more
my style.”

Reed said that designing the
costumes for this production
was been a learning experi-
ence and has given her a
greater appreciation for con-
temporary fashions because of
today’s less restricting styles.

Reed said that 18th-century
clothing has influenced her
desire to design contemporary

women’s clothes with 18th-
century qualities.

She said that she likes the
feminine features of the
clothes of that period, but
without the restricting corsets.
The clothing features she most
admires are the cuts of the
bodices, the lace and the frills.

“There are certain features
about 18th-century clothing
that made a statement,” Reed
said. “I think clothing should

enhance a woman’s body.”

' Her future goals, aside from
designing clothes with a more
feminine ﬂair, are to design
costumes for films, television
sitcoms or theater — and
eventually to win an Academy
Award for her work.

“I would want to win an
Oscar for best costume
design,” Reed said. “But it
would have to be contempo-
rary in style, because contem-

porary designs never win. The
period styles win because they
are more elaborate.”

Reed will graduate with her
master’s degree this month.
After graduation, she will
begin her job search right here
in Pittsburgh.

“I am glad that I came here,
and I have learned a lot since I
have been here,” Reed said. “I
think it is the beginning of
something better.”

Someone is playing an old Frank Sinatra_ tune in the back-

near.” Old Blue Eyes must have had us in mind, because now
that our end is near, we realize that we did do it our way. The
past year has been great, and we leave you with these, our
favorite little tidbits of wisdom:

“The Founding Fathers didn’t guarantee Freedom of the Press

Gordon's goodbyes and gratitudes

-former president of the
U.S., not a big fan of the
, edia, said that the rea-

son for his disdain was, simply,
because they have the last word.

Well, here’s mine.

I’ve been the editor in chief of
The Pitt News since May 10,
and there’ve been 115 issues
since then. And today’s is the last
one with my name on the top of
the editorial box.

But please, don’t shed any

tears for me; I’m sure some peo- _

ple reading this will be glad to
see me go. But live and let live,
that’s what I say.

So this. is my good-bye col-
umn, a tradition for editors in the
year’s final paper. This isn’t a
column that defends the exis-
tence of the paper or rips into the
people who have picked on us
throughout the year. No, this
good-bye column will be about
thanking the people who made it
all possible, a top 10 list of sorts.

There’re a lot more than 10
people who have heavily con-
tributed to the success of the
paper (like the section editors
who stuck it out all year), but
these people have played a sig-
niﬁcant role in the success of the
paper, andin me keeping my
sanity.

10. Pitt students, staff and
faculty.

Wether you loved or hated us,
you deﬁnitely read us. We set an
unofficial record this year for let-
ters to the editor, which not only
proves that people read The Pitt
News regularly, but maybe that
we’re not so apathetic after all.

And if you didn’t pick it up,
I’d be out of a job. '

9. Pitt’s Student Publications
Board.

I was wary of this group before
the year began; wary that it
would bring in one of the most
evil words in my vocabulary —
censorship. But alas, there were
no problems with the board this
year, mostly due to the intelli-
gence of the past two chairs,
Tom Wasleski and Anne
Rawlinson.

But even more importantly,
thanks for electing me as editor

    

Mak
Gordon

in chief.

8. The Pitt News Business
Staff.

Led by Business Manager
Kelly Ruebel, with a hand from
future manager Natalie
D’Antonio, “the other half’ of
The Pitt News is what kept us
running, no matter what we did
to piss off the advertisers.

7. My Uncle Ralph.

For as long as I can remember.
he’s been an instigator, Va motiva-
tor, a sympathizer and an
empathizer. And he’s always
been there for me.

6. Bill Moushey, Pitt writing
professor.

I only had Moushey for one
class, but even in that one semes-
ter he was a guiding force behind
some of my best work. If you’re
a writing major and you want to
learn from one of the best
around, sign up for a Moushey
class. You’ll leave his class with
two essentials for journalism —-
a thick skin and the knowledge
of how to write a lead.

5. Lillian Thomas, Pitt writ-
ing professor.

Two-and-a-half years ago. as a
clueless sophomore majoring in
political science, I took an intro
to journalism class that she
taught. Two months into the
semester, I had added English
Writing to my major and started
writing for The Pitt News.
Thomas has a lot to do with that.

Almost everyone has teachers
in college that they look back on
and who they say changed my
life. Bill Moushey and Lillian
Thomas are mine.

4. Christine Hanna, Editor in
Chief, 1994-95.

I only ﬁnished what she started

last year. She was the best editor
ever at The Pitt News. And she
came ‘into the paper after one of
its worst stretches.

I wouldn’t have this job or
kept it all year without her. Late
night phone calls with staﬁ prob-
lems or how to handle controver-
sy were the norm for Harma this
year.

3. Dennis Donham, Asst.
Director of Student Activities.

Much like the Pub Board,
when the year started, I looked at
this ofﬁce as a road block. It has
a certain agenda, and I thought it
might conﬂict with mine and The
Pitt News ’.

Unusual for many Pitt admin-
istrators, Donharn took a chance
with The Pitt News and me: he
was open and honest, but also
fair. He juggles a lot of responsi-
bility but always keeps the rea-
son why he’s there in the front of
his mind — Pitt students.

2. Rick Boyd, Pitt Police
Chief.

administrator I have seen in my
four years here. He genuinely
cares about Pitt and its students
and sincerely wants to make
Oakland a better place for us to
live and go to school.

And, like Donham. he took a
chance with me, starting when he
ﬁrst came to Pitt and I was the
crime reporter. Boyd consistently
kept me informed of what was
going on around the campus and,
despite running one of the largest
college police forces in the coun-
try, he was never too busy to talk.

One side note about Boyd (and
a memo to the suits in the
Cathedral): Running a police
department is one of the toughest
jobs in the world. Boyd is a
tremendous asset to the universi-
ty, and his performance shouldn’t
be taken for granted.

1. My Mom and Dad.

None of this would be remote-
ly possible without the support
my parentsgave me. both ﬁnan-
cially and morally.

Well. that’s it. My last words.
Thanks for reading them.

Mark Gnrrlon is the Editor in
Clzie/'(gfThe Pitt News

Hands down, Boyd is the best

\_\\\-X.

8Sports editor tells the rest of the

his is the end  my only
friend. the end 
Four years and what have

I got? Another piece of literature
from this damn school with my
name on it worth absolutely
nothing.

Well. I haven’t received my
diploma yet, so I’d better not get
my hopes up. The way things
have been going, it may end up
like Pitt’s basketball season: in it
until the end, only to dribble the
ball out of bounds.

But what have I learned the
most through my labors at this
prestigious institution? That
question can be answered
through my experiencesat The
Pitt News, since that’s been my

. life for the past year.

Nobody is ever happy.
Whether they are Greeks, ath-
letes, coaches, administrators or
Oakland store owners, every-
body has some kind of com-
plaint. It’s almost like some
rodent is crawling up their ass
that’s scratching and biting until
it’s too much to bear.

You can’t call me a hypocrite
because I'm rarely happy
myself. Do you want me to jump
up and down about the fact the
football team has gone 11 and a
lot (34 to be exact) in my four
years? I guess I should raise my
beer mug for a toast on Pitt’s
one, that’s o-n-e, Men’s NCAA
Basketball Tournament berth in
the same time. That was when I
was a freshman, and Zelda’s was

the place to be. My, how things
have changed. They’ve both
gone out of business. Do you
think I’ve enjoyed the ridicule
I’ve received from my friends at
Penn State? It all went downhill
for Pittsburgh sports in general
after Sid Bream scored in ‘92 to
knock the Pirates out of the
World Series.

Anyway, these whiners have
to find an outlet for their
malaise. They have to blame
somebody. So, they blame The
Pitt News because we’re the
ones who brought it to the public
first. Whether we had anything
to do with their problem or not,
we end up the scapegoat.

We report the news. We tell
over 30,000 people what is hap-

pening in our little bubble of a

university. We report good news.
We report bad news. It’s not our
fault the majority of the news
that happens here is bad. We

‘ have no control over that.

If anybody, not just Greek
pledges, ran through a female
shower in a dorm taking pic-
tures, we’d report it. If it had
been females who ran through a
male shower taking pictures,
we’d reportit. If it was the
Cathedral Flasher who did it,
we’d report it. If they were foot-
ball players who did it, we’d
report it. It’s not our fault the
idiots stupid enough to try this
were warma-be Greeks.

If a team ﬁnishes seventh out
of 13 teams, it struggled, right? It

Isles

didn’t ﬁnish ﬁrst. It didn’t even .

ﬁnish in the top half. Therefore,
it struggled. If it didn’t struggle,
it would’ve finished first. You
know what they say:
“Everybody wants a winner.”

Granted, seventh out of 13 for
one team is a lot better than half
the teams at this school. Now,
many of you reading this will
say, “The sports section is so
negative. It should report those
good things that happen every-
day, like when athletes make the
Dean’s List.”

Guess what: NOBODY
CARES. They should make the
Dean’s List. And nobody cares if
the Schenley Cafe Mystery
Meats team downs the Tower A
Cafeteria Pizza Rollers team in
intramural knife-throwing. If the
sports section had room to write
about it, we wouldn’t. The same
goes for a lot of the smaller
“club” sports. That’s unfortu-
nate, and I honestly feel bad, but
tl1ere’s nothing I can do about it.

The Pitt News, Thursday, April 18, 1996‘

story, the whole story

I can’t change people’s percep-
tions about knife—throwing, or
nay racing down Towers’ steps
when it snows. The big sports
get the majority of press,
because that’s what people want
to read about.

If it weren’t for us, and believe
this, nobody in Pittsburgh would
know who Andre Watson is.
who Najuma Fletcher is, who
Mark Bodo is. I bet if there was
a poll in Oakland asking resi-
dents if they knew Pitt had a
gymnastics team, most would
answer, “No.”

It was The Pitt News which
conveyed Watson’s remarkable
story to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette so that more people
found out about it. They then did
their own piece on him. (That’s
pretty negative, I suppose?) The
most print I’ve ever seen in
either the Post-Gazette, or the
Tribune-Review about arguably
the greatest athlete in collegiate
sports (Fletcher) is about five
lines on the Scoreboard page.
But we write about her, and the
rest of the team, after every
meet. The same for gymnastics.
The same for soccer.

I made it a point when I began
my reign as sports editor to give
more press to smaller sports.
There has been more written
about the track, cross country,
gymnastics, swimming and div-
ing squads and the lacrosse
teams during the last 11 months
than the previous 22 combined.

The Pitt News - the myth, the legend, the

hen I first arrived as
a freshman at Pitt, I
was tremendously

disappointed by what I per-
ceived as the total lack of qual-
ity of The Pitt News. I thought
that it was badly produced and
dull, and it just wasn’t “cool.”
A friend and I even toyed
with the idea of coming up
with an alternative — some-
thing comparable to the news-

- papers I’d seen during my vis-

its to various liberal arts col-

~ leges. We wanted scintillating

political commentary, interest-
ing features, creativity.

Fortunately, we were advised
by those more experienced
than ourselves to calm down,
get a grip on our freshman ide-
alistic fantasies and find out
what The Pitt News was really
like. They told us to work for
it, and if, after giving it a
chance and getting some prac-
tical experience, we still didn’t
like it, to reconsider our idea
of an alternative publication.

I didn’t listen to this at the
time — all-knowing freshman
that I was — although I did
give up on the proposed ven-
ture. I fell into working for
The Pitt News a year later
somewhat hapzardly and with-
out much forethought.

Since that time, I’ve gradual-
ly become more drawn into the

process of putting out a paper
four times a week. This is not
simply some photo-copied,
semi-weekly newsletter; we do
our best to produce a truly pro-
fessional paper. What we do
up in the office matters to me,
and I care about what people
think about it — as do all the
editors. Ironically, both myself
and the aforementioned friend
are now on the editorial board.

I hear the opinions that I
used to hold about the paper
echoed all over campus.
People say that the stories are
largely unimportant, that the
writing is pathetic, that it is
either too liberal or too conser-
vative, that it tries to start con-
troversy or defame certain
groups. Many of these opin-
ions are based upon misunder-
standings of the role of The
Pitt News — and they are
things that I once thought
myself. It is easy enough to
say such things — and it
sounds cool to do so — but
backing it up with knowledge
is a different matter.

The Pitt News provides all
interested students with a
forum in which to gain practi-
cal and realistic newspaper
experience. There are dead-
lines, and there is pressure.
This is a real newspaper, and,
as such, its role is to report on

Reb_ecca
Briggs

the events of the community it
represents —— be it an SGB
meeting or a fraternity bust. If
it’s newsworthy, we report it.

The media’s role is as watch-
dog. If you screw up, we’re
going to let people know, but
we can’t lead you into traps.
On the same token, if you do
something positive, we’ll be
glad to report on it.

The editors and staff are not
playing a game, reveling in the
misfortune of others, hoping to
embarrass chosen enemies
publicly. Questions of joumal-
istic integrity arise nearly
every night. The editors do
their best to come up with an
ethical solution to problems
which exist for all professional
newspapers. Often there is no
clear-cut right or wrong.

Sometimes editors make
mistakes. I have certainly
made my share. They should
definitely be held’ accountable
when they do so, but it should
not be forgotten that the publi-
cation of this paper is a learn-
ing experience for everyone
involved.

The Pitt News is a classroom
for students, but failure here
results in more than a bad
grade — it can result in cam-

pus-wide disregard and
loathing. Our names are on
that paper for the whole uni-
versity to see. Such public
scrutiny is a huge responsibili-

ty, and obviously it is not one

that anyone can afford to take
lightly. I

I have heard students say
that they-would never be
involved with trash like The
Pitt News, that they would
never sink so low. All I can
say is: Don’t use that as an
excuse. V

If you cannot afford the time
and energy necessary, that is
understandable. But you are a
hypocrite if you complain
about the quality of something
that you are not willing to
make better with your own
involvement. The paper
always needs writers, colum-
nists and staffers, and no pre-
vious journalism experience is
necessary.

If you don’t agree with an
opinion published in the paper,
come up to the office and
voice your own views. The Pitt
News tries to be as representa-
tive as possible, but its success
ultimately lies with the indi-
viduals of the campus commu-
nity.

I would give the same advice
that was given to me my fresh-
man year: Participate in The

For that I vehemently thank my
writers. And the athletes and
coaches for these sports should
thank them too. (That’s negative
too, I suppose?)

So for all you people reading
this who have complained that
we’re so negative, why don’t
you change it? Why don’t you
get your positiveness off the
couch (the O.J. tnal’s been over
for quite a long time) and come
up here? Put in the 40-plus hours
per week while carrying a full
class—load,and other things like
an internship or a different job.

Come on up. The Pitt News
welcomes writers everyday. No
experience is necessary. You
don’t even need to know how to
spell — we have other people
who fix the mistakes. If you
want to cover who makes it to
their dorm room the fastest from
the Miami Subs corner on a
Friday night, come on up. I can
see the headline now:
“Sophomore walks on to track
team after coach times her mak-
ing it from Subs’ comer to 17th
floor of Tower in 13.61 sec-
onds.” (That’s negative too, isn’t
it?).

reality

Pitt News for a year or so and
find out what really goes into
the production of a newspaper.
Consider how you would deal
with various dilemmas instead
of simply complaining to your
friends about the unfairness of
it all. Then, if you still want to
rip it apart, feel free.
' **>|< ***

My opinions have certainly
changed, though. I think this is
one hell of a quality produc-

tion —— mistakes and all.
We’ve reported fairly on
Greeks, Republicans,

Democrats, SGB, etc. To do
any less would have been
ignoring the blatant realities of
this university. We aren’t any-
one’s public relations service,
but we don’t hold grudges sim-
ply because of group affilia-
tion. Personal animosities have
no place in a newspaper, and
they have had no place in The
Pitt News reporting.

I’m not suggesting that you

become a Pitt News groupie. I
don’t think we would know
how to handle all that adora-
tion. But, just once in a while,
consider being just a bit
uncool and giving credit where
credit is due.

The bitch is back... a final Vote of thanks to the fan club

nd I’d like to thank the
AAcademy, Aunt Susie,

Cousin Jimmy Joe Bob
 No, really. It’s a goodbye col-
umn, but not like that. I’ve been
here for three years, and I’ve
been writing for the paper for a
year now. Tons of stuff has hap-
pened in that time, and I’d like
to share some of it with you.

And finally, it’s time to name
names.

I think, to begin, I’d like to
thank Mr. Ferris J. Anderson.
His eloquent remarks in regard
to my Greek column provided
hours of entertainment for all
my friends. Let me just say that
every time I bow down to the
altar of my vagina, I think of
you.

Second would have to be the
unknown number of people
who have taken the time to
respond to my columns over
the year. Due to these ever-dili-
gent respondents, I am every-
thing from a jack-booted Nazi
bitch to a heartless, uncaring
bitch (whatever I was called,
“bitch” usually appeared in the
commentary). I am sexist
(because I don’t feel men owe
me special treatment), racist
(because I do not feel the need
to give racial minorities special
privileges) and every other —ist
you can imagine. I have been
told I am not a ‘‘real’’ woman. (I
wonder what the doctor who
delivered me would think?) At
least my spectrum is “broad”
(not to mention my gender).

Next, I would have to thank

Linda Orbach, undergraduate
advisor for the. English
Department. After I wrote a
column criticizing certain mem-
bers of her department, I was
labeled a heretic. When I went
to be “advised,” she told me I
had no right to criticize general
writing classes since I had
never taken one. But when I
told her my opinion was based
on several friends’ experiences
in the class, she said, “They
probably couldn’t write” (or
something like that). Let’s test
this logic, shall we? I can’t
judge a class I have never
taken, but Ms. Orbach is per-
fectly able to judge my friends’
(whom she has never met)
writing ability. Hmmm. I think
not.

I would also like to thank the
numerous persons who
responded to the editorial about
Mumia Abu-Jamal. One of
these people was kind enough
to inform me that I “don’t have
the right to any God damn
opinion I want!” Oh? I must
have misread the term -“opin-
ion” in the dictionary. I thought
the word had something to do
with personal beliefs, values,
etc. Apparently, I was wrong.

According to this man (I wish I"

could remember his name), I
am only entitled to an opinion if
it is the politically correct/sup-
ported opinion. Otherwise, I
guess I’m out of luck.

Wait, back to the bitch com-
ments — I almost forgot an
important one! Dan Corle of the

    

Erka
Kendra

University Democrats
approached me one day and
asked me if I really believed in
the things I wrote, or if I just
wrote things to get a reaction.
“I wanted to see if. you were
really as bitchy as you seemed
in your columns.” In case this
was really unclear, yes —— I
really believe in everything I
write. I have better things to do
with my time than to sit around
thinking up ways-to piss people
off. Regarding the second half
of the comment, I can be just as
bitchy in real life. And my
friends (and some of my ene-
mies) will vouch that I can be
even bitchier than that.
Anyway, where was I —
right! Not any opinion I want.
This brings me to some of my
esteemed professors over the
past three years. One of my
favorites was Eric Clarke
(Victorian Novel.) This class
disallowed use of the words
“he,” “human” and “mankind”
in class. But we could use the

word “she.” How very gender-

friendly of him! I think our
lives all changed drastically for
the better thanks to that little
piece of agenda which found its
way into the class. Mr. Clarke
also shared with us his beliefs
that the traditional American
family is extinct and that mar-
riage is a joke. Thanks for the
input, Mr. Clarke, but my par-
ents (married 24 years next
week) might disagree with you

on both points.
What would this column be
without mentioning the

Greeks? Since I don’t want
them to feel left out, I’ll
squeeze them in now. Let me
just say, in response to all the
letters I received earlier this
year, that I do have fairly first-
hand knowledge of your sys-
tem’s inner workings. My sister
was Greek —— until the frat (she
was a little sister) considered
blackballing her for breaking
up with one of the brothers. A
very good friend of mine was
Greek —- until he drank himself
out of school by failing every
class he had during his fresh-
man year. His brothers must
have been great friends to let

that happen (especially since he

was only 19). My friends don’t
care who I date, they take.care
of me if I get falling down
drunk, I don’t need to pay them
every semester (though I do
cook dinner for them every
now and then) and I don’t have
to get stupid little Greek letters
tattooed on my ankle.

Finally (and, believe it or not,

seriously), I do have a list of
people I would like to thank for
making this part of my life
memorable. Patrick, Keira, Dan
and Drew — you guys (sorry,
make that persuns of unnamed
gender) are the best. I would
have gone crazy without you
this past year. I love you all (but
please don’t make me say the
secret Omega Super-Delta‘
Force password in order to get
into the house).

Thanks to the University
Honors College, Dean Stewart
and Professor Peter Karsten for
sponsoring my thesis. Also
thanks to professors Van Beck
Hall, Laurence Glasco and Paul
Finkelman for serving as my
defense committee. (It will be
officially done early next
week.) The experience was one
of the most valuable I have had
in the course of my college
career.

There are several other peo-
ple who have been all—around

wonderful: professors Harry g

Mooney (English literature)
and Janelle Greenberg (history),
Kathleen Veslany (English
writing) and Gail Martin (histo-
ry undergrad advisor). You

all made college a wonderful _

experience; for that I thank you.

Finally (please forgive the ,

sappy melodrama), Mom and
Dad. I love you both more than
I could ever express. Thank you
for everything.

final sports column of
the year for The Pitt
News, then I’m sure you
have digested the harsh criti-
cism, arrogant sarcasm and
just all-out bashing of vari-
ous sports that has graced
these sacred pages. I will be
the first to admit that at
times throughout the year I
have taken my own shots at
some sports personalities,
some of which were
uncalled for and some that
were just downright rude.
The time of the year has
come when everyone looks
back on what happened
around campus and around
the world in sports and in
their lives as well. For many
dedicated readers of The Pitt
News, this will be the last
time they pick up our paper
as undergraduates. No

If you are reading this, the

"longer will they sit around

the cafeterias and shout
expletives about Pitt foot-
ball, Bigelow Boulevard and
the computers at the Student

This may seem like only a
splash of paint in a much
larger picture, but there is
more to it than meets the
eye.

The last few days have
been filled with Athletes of
the Year, high and low
moments in Pitt sports and
evenisome reflections back
to what many hoped would
be a banner year in intercol-
legiate athletics for our hal-
lowed university.

The last few days have
been filled with thoughts of
what could have, and should
have, been for Pitt. Criticism
of coaches,_players and fans
havefound their way into
this publication yet again.
Fine, the readers may chuck-

with pride that you had the
courage to take another pot

The moment we've all been waiting

By Geoff Moak
Staﬂvwriter

It’s the end of the year, and
that means it’s time for every-
one’s nostalgic look back at the
year that was. The sports depart-_
ment here at The Pitt News is no
exception. You may have tried
to forget some of this, but you
can’t escape the memories of
this year in Pitt sports.

For the Big East Conference,
the highlight of the season was
the addition of three new teams,
West Virginia, Rutgers and
Notre Dame in most sports. The
newcomers won a few confer-
ence championships and more
than their share of games in their
inaugural season.

At Pitt, two of our teams
never had a chance to play with
the new kids in town. The men’s
tennis and men’s gymnastics
teams were victims of Title IX,
a NCAA by-law that was meant
to ensure gender equality in all
activities, including athletics, for
federally funded institutions.
Since Pitt had 11 men’s sports
and only eight for women,
men’s temiis and men’s gymnas-
tics were cut for the 1995-96
season. Next year, women’s soc-
cer will be added to bring the

With two fewer teams, 17
squads represented Pitt this sea-

promisingly. We honestly

believed the football team had a

  

shot at .500 for the first time in
recent memory. With two
impressive wins to start the sea-
son, it looked like we had reason
to believe that maybe a bowl
game was possible. In hindsight,
we now see that we were fool-

ish.

The loss to Texas was chalked
up to experience. The next
week, well, nobody ever really
expected Pitt to beat Ohio State,
but the Panthers at least hung
close for a half despite the fact
that most of the Panthers’
“home” crowd was cheering for
the Buckeyes. By the end of the

Virginia Tech game, it was ,

apparent that the ridiculous
amount of injuries suffered by
the Panthers had finally done
them in. Later losses to teams
like Temple and Rutgers con-
firmed those suspicions, and we
were forced to hope for .500
next year one more time.

It was fitting that Penn State

- chose this, already a miserable

year in Pitt football, to give the
football program even more
good news. Joe Patemo andhis
puppets at the Penn State athlet-
ics office decided that they
wanted to end one of college
football’s best rivalries. The
Nittany Lions announced that
after the turn of the century, they
will no ' longer play games
against Pitt, thus reiterating
what we at Pitt have been saying
all along: Penn State sucks.

Pih‘ downs West Virginia at Three Rivers

By Kevin Lilley
Staff Writer

Yesterday, the Pitt baseball
team went big league, playing
the first of three scheduled
games this season in Three
Rivers Stadium.

Against the unfamiliar
background of AstroTurf,
major-league-distance fences
and over 40,000 empty seats,
the Panthers lived up to the
billing, downing West
Virginia 4-1.

“It was a good experience,”
said leftfielder Jason
Workman of his first chance
on a major-league diamond.
“It looked bigger on TV, but

playing on it pretty much
seemed the same.”

Pitt shortstop Sam Crawley
stole the spotlight on this spe-
cial occasion with a two-for-
three performance, including
a two—run double. Second
baseman Joe Carter had the
only other extra—base hit for
the Panthers, who were limit-
ed to just five hits by
Mountaineer pitching.

“We got guys on base,” said
Workman, “and we got the
hits when we needed them.”

Carter opened the third for
the Panthers with a double,
and advanced to third on Bill
Derr’s single. Scott Lobaugh,
in a rare start at third base,

walked to load the bases.

West Virginia pitcher
Jeremy Cummings coaxed
Kurt Womelsdorf into a field-
er’s choice, which scored
Carter. Derr scored on Jason
Conti’s sacrifice ﬂy and gave
Pitt a 2-0 lead.

Crowley’s heroics came in
the ﬁfth, with the score still 2-

0. Womelsdorf reached third~

thanks to a single and a stolen
base, and Conti was given a
free pass to set the plate for
the shortstop. A wild pitch
moved both runners into scor-
ing position before Crowley
cleared the bases and chased
Cummings from the contest.
“Sam’s been hitting  and

Lou [Melucci]’s been hitting,”
said Workman of the team’s
two shortstops. “I don’t know
what Coach [Mark Jackson] is
going to do.”

Melucci and Crowley are
hitting .294 and .292 on the
season, respectively. Not sur-
prisingly, Crowley got the nod
for this Big East contest since
his average jumps to .308 in
conference, while Melucci’s
bottoms out to .189.

Unlike the hitters, the Pitt
hurlers thrived in the-cav-
ernous conditions, shutting
the Mountaineers down in all
but the final

nasty remarks about the underachieving men’s basketball
team. What we can do, and what I’d like to do here, is tip
our hat to each and every athlete who put in hours of prac-
tice throughout the year and got little respect or recognition,
especially the seniors who don’t have a chance to win back
the critics who gave up on them. Actually, I don’t think
many of them would even want that chance.

Before you pack your bags and hop in the car to go home‘
next week, seriously think about what you have offered to
Pitt. Think about how you will be remembered here, if you
will at all, and ask yourself if you’re content with the
answer. If your days at Pitt are not over, I recommend that
you take a moment out of your busy summer schedule and
think about how you can make a difference somewhere
instead of criticizing those people who already do. I know
that I will.

So for the last time this year, I will leave you with some
Freudian advice. It may not have a lot to do with sports, but
we all know that sports are only just a game anyway and that
there are more important things to worry about.

A repressed memory doesn’t go away; it just continues to
haunt you. Don’t leave anything unfinished, or you will
regret it as long as you live.

Good luck to all graduating seniors and to all those under-
grads left: Remember there are only 132 days until Fall ‘96
classes begin.

football team over the course of

the season was recreated on an
almost nightly basis by the.

men’s basketball team. There
were a few notable exceptions
(the Georgetown victory comes
to mind), but on more than one
occasion, Pitt played well for 35
minutes only to lose a game in
the last five. Pitt brought the
Field House Fanatics to the
brink of madness against then-
No. 1 UMass before the
Minutemen won in overtime.
Things were no less exciting
two nights later when Pitt took
eventual Big East Champion
Connecticut to the final minutes.
There was more of the same
when Villanova visited the Civic
Arena. But Pitt lost all of those
games.

With so many close games,
you’d think it would be difficult
to single out one particularly
ugly loss, but the Panthers out-
did themselves in this category,
too. In one of the most heart-
breaking losses in school histo-
ry, Pitt had a 20-point lead at
Rutgers with just over seven
minutes left in the game but
blew the lead and lost the game
by one point. For all the bright
moments it provided, the men’s
basketball team also left us
looking forward to next year.

On the other hand, the
women’s basketball team never
got anyone excited, except
maybe the teams that got to play
against it. The Lady Panthers
went 4-23 on the regular season.
setting a school record for most
losses in a season. The bright
spot was the Big East tourna-
ment, where they beat Miami
and Villanova before losing to
eventual champion Connecticut
in the semiﬁnals.

Pitt didn’t win much of any-
thing this season, but it does
have a lovely consolation prize.

Two of its top players, guard
Gina Montesano and center
Latia Howard, are a freshman
and a sophomore, respectively.
So, despite the loss of senior
Stephanie Petho, the future
looks brighter for Pitt.

Speaking of bright futures, the S

Pitt tennis team is full of talent.

The senior leadership was there '

at the beginning of the season in
the form of Marla Zielinski and
Alison Baker. To complement
them, sophomore Fran Davis
emerged as the No. 1 player, and
freshman Erin Shalbrack and
Jen Bible provided the final
push that gave the team a shot at
a new school record for victories
in a season.

Scattered among those victo-
ries were wins over some of
Pitt’s biggest rivals. The team
beat arch-rival Duquesne for the
first time in two years and beat
St. Bonaventure for the first
time in Head Coach George
Dieffenbach’s 16-year career at
Pitt. It also earned a measure of
revenge when it crushed
Villanova, the team that
knocked it out of the Big East
Championships last season.

Several Pitt teams were close
to the top, but not quite there. It
wasn’t always Pitt’s fault. The
men’s soccer team had an out-
standing regular season. ooing
l4—6—l and finishing second in
the Big East. It was one of this
school’s most successful teams
this season. And calling the soc-
cer team’s performance a sur-
prise would be like saying the
Titanic was a minor accident.
Most people thought Pitt soccer

, would bring up the rear in the

Big East this season.

The 14 wins set a new school
record. They included wins over
nationally—ranked Big East foes
Rutgers and St. John’s. The
Panthers finished the season

ranked No. 22 in the country,
but the NCAA tournament
selection committee somehow
overlooked all of that and left
Pitt watching the tournament at
home. '

The wrestling team finished
the season at about the same
point where it seems to finish
every year. Pitt spent most of the
dual-meet season ranked No. 21
in the country, the spot where it
ended up. Pitt’s ﬁnal dual-meet
record was 13-8-1, and it came
in fourth at the Eastern
Wrestling League tournament.
Five Pitt wrestlers went to the
NCAA tournament. Their per-
formances, led by All-
Americans Mark Bodo and Pat
VV1ltanger, put Pitt in 24th place
at the tournament.

The Panthers set out with the
goal of winning the EWL cham-
pionship and ﬁnishing in the top
10 nationally, and they fell short
of both of those goals. The
squad was one of the most tal-
ented of all Pitt’s teams, but the
talented individuals were unable
to come together at the same
time. The result was a record of
0-6 in dual meets against the
nation’s top 10 teams, which
kept them from achieving their
goals. A

The women’s volleyball team
was a victim of one of the new
teams in the conference. Pitt’s
suing of seven consecutive Big
East titles was broken by Notre
Dame. Pitt defeated just about
everyone else in the conference,
but whether it was the regular
season or the ﬁnals of the Big
East tournament, Pitt was never
able to beat Notre Dame.

A long season with more ﬁve-
game matches than most of the

players were accustomed to
finally took its toll on the vol-
leyball team.‘ At the Big East
tournament, Pitt rallied to beat
Georgetown in five games in the
semifinals. After taking the ﬁrst
game from Notre Dame in the
finals, the Panthers sputtered
again and couldn’t recover,
bringing Pitt’s domination of the
conference to a screeching halt.

The men’s swimming and -

diving team was another runner-
up at the conference champi-
onships. Pitt’s men ﬁnished sec-
ond behind Syracuse. The
women ﬁnished sixth. The real
success stories came from the
divers. ‘

Sunday Lewandowski won
the one-meter at the Big East
championships. She went on to
qualify for the NCAA champi-
onships in both the one-meter
and three-meter events. John
Soulakis was shut out by divers
from Miami at the Big East
championships, but he joined
Lewandowski, earning All-
American status.

The men’s and women’s track
teams had their shining
moments. Najuma Fletcher once
again won more awards than
most of us will ever see, includ-
ing the NCAA indoor high jump
championship. Freshman Trecia
Smith proved that she’s up" to
the challenge of trying to ﬁll the
void left at the heart of the team
by the departure of Fletcher.

All of Pitt’s relay teams, both ‘ 

men and women, qualiﬁed for

Baseball-

°From page 10

started and went 3 1/3 score- I

less innings, giving up just
three hits and walking ‘none
in his limited action. Mike
Rohrbach got the win in
relief, picking up the remain-
ing innings and allowing one
run on five hits.

“He was doing a good job,”
said Workman of Skokowski,
“but they wanted to get them
all some work.”

The Mountaineer run came
on a one-out RBI double by
pinch-hitter Rick Satcho.
Rohrbach sandwiched a sin-
gle between two groundouts
to the mound, ending the last-
ditch rally.

Despite the unfamiliar sur-
roundings, neither squad
committed an error the entire
afternoon. The game was a
complete contrast to the
team’s earlier meeting at
WVU, a 12-11 shootout won
by the Mountaineers during
which each team committed
four miscues.

Pitt rounds out its Three
Rivers schedule today with a
doubleheader against Akron.
The Zips , defeated the
Panthers 9-1 in an April 2
contest this season.

Year

°From page 13

The cross country teams set
the tone for the track season.
The men’s and women’s squads
both dominated at the St.
Francis Invitational. The
women also won the Malone
Invitational. The men finished
second at one of the year’s
biggest meets, the Bobcat
Invitational at Ohio University.

It took a while, but the
women’s gymnastics team
finally hit its goal this season:
the elusive 190 mark. Pitt first
scored 190 points in one meet
at Maryland, where it scored a
total of 190.575. That perfor-
mance was clouded by the fact
that Pitt didn’t even win the
meet. Maryland topped 193
points to take first place. The
highlight of the Panthers’ sea-
son was yet to come.

Pitt waited until it was at its
home gym to really break loose.
At the last home meet of the
season, Pitt shattered its school
record by scoring 191.95
points, defeating IUP, Western

A Michigan and Temple.

The baseball team set out this
season to defend its Big East
championship, ‘a quest that had
a rocky beginning. The
Panthers started out 4-7 in Big
East play, hardly the mark of a
championship team. But the
season is young, and the
Panthers still have time to come
alive, something they have
shown signs of doing recently.

This year is just about history,
so you can start to clear out
these memories. File them
away in the part of your sub-
conscious where the words to
“My Sharona” are still ﬂoating
around. Make room in your
head, because at about this time
next year, these teams will fill
up another four—page story with
more things to remember.

Saturn. Like the quiet, comfortable ride and stain-
resistant seats. And if a Saturn can make Meow-C
the cat happy, Well,‘ chances are, it can make

it would be tough to find a
more experimental music part-
ner than Elliot Sharp. For years
this New York avant-garde jazz
composer has been perfecting
a structurally complex brand of
experimental jazzfusion ‘in
clubs like the Knitting Factory
and on his EMY Recording
Label releases. Described by
the New York Times as pos-
sessing a sound that is “part
tribal and part twentieth century
industrial,” Sharp gives new
meaning to “innovative” and
other adjectives commonly
abused by pretentious music
reviewers. His collaborations
with adventurous friends from
downtown NYC led to the birth

 

of Carbon, a quartet featuring
Sharp’s noisy guitar swagger-
ing against a backdrop of
sometimes funky, sometimes
crunchy, always inventive
improvisation.

However, Sharp won’t be
bringing the Carbonites to this
town any time soon. Instead,
he will be accompanied by
Zeena Parkins, with whom he
realizes his most avant improv

dreams on the latest Elliot.

Sharp/Carbon release,
“Psycho-Acoustic." Parkins
adds color to the '

Sharp palette with some elec-
tric harp thrown into the
“Psycho-Acoustic” mix, a disc
that demonstrates that Elliot
and Co. aren't worried that

of rave and other techno-orient-
ed netherlands of independent
music. In fact, the liner notes of
their last collaborative effort,
“lnterference," includes an e-
mail address to make Sharp
cyberconveniently open to all
opinions. Hell, you can write
him your own review of his

stage presence after catching‘

his April 29th performance at
the Oakland Beehive, a show

that will feature just Elliot and T

Zeena Parkins doing their
impressive, progressive thing.
Their performance will be an
exercise in minimalism of the
purest form

and will force hyper-kulchured
Pittsburgh folk to swoon in their
highchairs. With local improvi-
sational quintetwatershed as
the opening act, this show
promises not to let down even

written by Eric Bogosian
directed by Chris Potocki
Axiom Theater

“The strangest aspect of
growing up where I grew up is
thinking you know everything
about the world, when, in fact,
you know nothing. This is the
story of me and mine, as it
continues today, all over
America.” Taken from the
introduction to Eric Bogosian’s
SubUrbia, the play focuses on
the restlessness ofyoung
people growing up immersed
media.

Bogosian is best known for
his Talk Radio piece which
was made into a movie.
SubUrbia has recently
received attention for film,
sparking interest in
Bogosian’s pop humor again.
, Using the middle class as a
microcosm of American living,
Bogosian questions the shel-
tered fantasy that parents
raise their kids as a conse-
quence of media images.

The setting is a 7-11 park-
ing lot that is a routine hang-
out for young suburbanites.
The three main characters,
Buff, Tim and Jeff, are old
high school" buddies who dis-
cuss the relevance of culture
in their lives over beer and
Oreos. Whether the topic of
discussion is the pizza or for-
eigners, they all share an
ignorance about the world.
They can't seem to escape
their hometown state of mind.
The influences of media have
built a wall around the oppor-
tunities they continually dis-
cuss.

Norman, a Pakistani owner
of the 7-11, introduces the
racial tensions within the
story. Strong violent scenes
break out, posing serious
questions about how our soci-
ety views foreigners who wish
to make their way in America.

 

e comeria va ue 0
objects has taken over the
community, and the group of
youths are in a constant battle
to find their identities.

The blatant perverseness
that occupies the characters’
intentions is a paradox that is
linked to the invisible control
of the conservative bureau-
cracy found in traditional sit-
coms. The subjective use of
materialization is symbolized
by modern logos and brand
names. The script demands a
deep analysis of what
Bogosian is trying to convey
with his mainstream compar-
isons of pop culture.

Director Chris Potocki elab-
orates Bogosian’s inspiration
by emphasizing the presence
of suburban cliches in the per-
formance. “The 1950s image
of Mom baking a pie and Dad
smoking a pipe are not reality
to the kids in the show,” said
Potocki. “Dad is an alcoholic
who cares more about his car
than the safety of his son.
instead of playing innocent
games all their lives, kids can
end up suicidal.” The kids in
this show are in a community
where everyone looks alike
and change is not accepted.
Having a different identity is
viewed as wrong.

“The mentality of the show
is not that the kids are stupid
or lazy,” said Potocki. “lnstant
satisfaction is the motivation
for the characters to get what
they want.” Potocki is con-
cerned with the built-up ener-
gy the characters have from
being in the same town all
there lives. The ever-chang-
ing, disposable values that the
characters live amongst
underlie the message of the
show. Potocki accentuates
the perspective that today's
generation is impatient
because it lives in a world
stimulated by multimedia.

The script calls for loud

I

music that reflects the themes
of the play. Local artists col-
laborated to take ‘50s
melodies from classic groups
such as the Monkees and
step it up eight levels. The
audience can also expect a
punk version of tunes from
Mr. Rogers and Sinatra.
Bitter Delores, Blougart,
WADE and members of
Cynics & Honeyburst got
together to splice up tunes to
accompany the show’s
destructive feel. The idea was
to create an image of what
people want to think is there
and to contrast it with harsh
reality, said Potocki.

The show is being present-
ed by The Axiom theatre
group and is being shown at
the Hamburg Theatre (next to
City Theatre). Performances
run till April 27, Thur-Sat at 8

p.m. Student tickets are $8.

School for Scandal
written by Richard Sheridan
directed by Richard Kietel
Pitt Theater

The humor is two centuries
old and has found a place in
modern theater. Playwright
Richard Sheridan created this
classic piece with brilliant wit
that has withstood translations
into the 20th century. The fol-
lies of the simple-minded
bourgeoisie provide Pitt’s cast
with a spirited challenge. They

Lorien Clemens and David Novinski in School For Scandal, directe y Richard Kietal. H

must recreate the high-brow
etiquette and posture that
characterizes that time period.

The setting is London. As
most 18th-century pieces,
School for Scandal is based
upon love games wrapped in
strong sarcastic caricatures.
Ironically, many of these
themes can still be found
today. This is one of the rea-
sons why School for Scandal
has been able to find a place
in Pitt’s Theatre Department.

Lady Teazle, Lorien
Clemens, is a 20-year-old flirt
who marries a wealthy 6'0-
year-old man, Benjamin
Smith. Originally from the
country, Lady Teazle enjoys
the frolic of being young and
wealthy. The attention Lady
Teazle receives from adoring
men soon leads her into trou-
ble. Bickering and teasing
supply the script with sharp
comedy that is meant to leave
the audience in stitches.

The dialogue is a‘ shuffle of
iiistful tattle-taling. By poking
fun at sex scandals and comi-
cal situations, the script gains
its high comic charm.

Lorien Clemens is perform-
ing Lady Teazle as her thesis
role. The play-’s time period
posed challenges for Clemens
and the cast. Through a col-
laborative effort from Director
Keitel and movement coach-
es, Sarah Barker and Dennis
Kravsnick, the ensemble was

- ‘I. 4

 

able to become more fluent
with the movements and large
decorative costumes. Some of
the antique language had to
be changed, but the show is
still in its original form._

“This is one of the best
comedies written in the
English languag_e,” said
Clemins. “l have fun with it on
stage.”

Clemens’ character creates
a web of deceit with her lies
and rumors. The stage
becomes busy when farcical
scenes reveal the selfish
intentions of the characters.
Lady Teazle gets caught in
the act of seduction in a clas-
sical scene involving a screen
that falls and unveils her,
blushing from her husband’s
discovery.

Letting the actors find them-
selves in their role was one
way that Director Keitel
encouraged the actors to
develop their aristocratic char-
acters. The script is straight-
out dry English Theatre.
“Because the piece is high
English comedy, I needed to
learn how totrust the comic
interest,” said Clemens. A
cast of 20 interprets the two-
and-half-hour show embellish-
ing every hilarious moment of
the masterpiece. ,

Show runs at The Studio
Theatre till April 20 and at the
Stephen Foster May 1-3.

April 18 1996 » I _ _ Page 3

Four o’c|ock Saturday morn-
ing I loaded up the Volvo to
head out to Jersey for the
yearly Chiller Convention.
Fuckit, big deal. The Chiller
Con is only the East Coast’s
biggest sci-fi horror Asian
movie convention which hosts
many of the biggest B-movie
stars the entertainment world
has to offer. If you are like me
and have a fetish for freaks,
fucktards, snuff films, Santo,
Satanism, scream queens,
death, destruction and Disney,
you should of been there.

I arrived at the Meadow
Lands Hilton (where the con-
vention is held) at about 10:30
in the morning on Saturday.
The first thing I usually check
out is who is on the star list.
This year it was Vernon Wells ’
of The Fload Warrior, Kim
Hunter of the Planet of the
Apes and many of Roger
Corman’s finest (such as
Swamp Vixens). The Addam’s
Family’s Lurch was also there,
along with a host of big-breast-
ed, skantily clad she-stars of

the soft-core porn industy.
Seems like no one too inter-
esting. Off to the show room,
where there was table after
table of movie memrobalia of
the hard-to-find kind.

So now it was time to find
the movies I desired for my
personal collection. Like any
profesional nerd, I had a list.
Well, at least until I lost it, so
now I'm working from memory._
The first thing that pops in my
mind is the five-hour version of
Apocalypse Now which I
could not find. First miss. Then
Rainbow Theives, an
Alexandro Joderowski flick.
Everyone gave me the old “my
copy is not good enough to
sell” bullshit. Then out of the
corner of my fucking eye I see
this black guy who resembles
Blaxploitation God Fludy Flay
Moore  better known as
Dolomite, motherfucker! ljust
had to get a photo!

This is when I abanded the .
Low Road of Flare Films and
shifted into my Asian High
Action mode. What’s new in
the realm‘ of Jet Lee? I needed

 

 

a new copy of A
Master of Tai 

Che and possi- Our man Flo with G.G. Allin s brother, Mee, at the Chiller Convention-
The East Coast's biggest Vidfest.

bly a wide-
screen version
of Fist of Legend for when the
crew comes over. I also had
an appointment with this dude
from Mexico who told me via
the Internet that he would hold
some of his vintage Shaw
Brothers movies for me. I was
in search of Death to All Wu
Tang. He told me I should
wake up, and I checked out
what he had. Eight Diagram
Pole Fighter was mine and so
was the One Armed
Swordsman. He also gave me

‘ a Blue Demon wrestling mask

(you know Blue Demon, El
Santo’s bestest buddy from
the ever so populer Mexican
wrestliung films). '
There are so many movies

to look through before you lose
your mind, so off to find a
hotel, which was very futile, so
my strategy from here on in
was to meet some retards
whose camp it would be easy"
to infiltrate (or in laymens’

terms, convince them to let me
crash in their hotel room). The
trick is to find dudes whose
asses I would definitely have
no trouble beating, just in case
they might try to start some-
thing. (Two years ago, I met
these bikers at the bar and
ended up crashin’ with them
and woke up after being acci-
dentally sodomized six times.)

Enough of that for now.
Some one told me there was a
copy of Orson Wells’ Chimes
at Midnight Then, as if it were
a mirage, Merle Allin, GG
Al|in’s brother was standing in
front of me like a cherub, so
time to get the camera out,
because who knows when this
fucker’s gonna drop off the
face of the earth.

I better give you some info
about the Chiller before I for-.
get it. The actual name is the
Chiller Theater Model, Toy and
Video Convention. It happens
about every six months in

 

Secocus, N.J., at the
Meadowlands Hilton. If inter-
ested, you could probably con-
tact the Hilton, and they could
give you the info. Any hard-to-
find movies can usally be
found there. You can get all
the John Woo flicks, hard-to-
find Italian horror and
Spaghetti Westerns. Enough
porn to satisfy any pervert ,
(and I will not say that snuff
«films exist, but if they did, you
might find them at the Chiller).
All in all, anyone who is bored
with the Hollywood film indus-
try and is looking for some-
thing different can surely find it
at the Chiller. Beside the
Satanic overtones, the best
thing about it is the fact that

the whole thing is totally illegal.

If you go up there to sell any
bootlegs, though, better watch
out, because the MPAA Nazis
were arresting mugs left and
right.

The City of Lost Children

. Directed by Marc Caro and

Jean-Pierre Jeunet
With Ron Perlman, Judith
Vittet and Daniel Emilfork

With the biggest budget in
French film history, The City of
Lost Children has got all the
effects sci—fi heads could ever
dream up. Some effects are
derivative of Cronenberg and
'Gil|iam’s work, but none.are
completely stock. |t’s a bizarre
fairy tale told through its mish-
mash fantasy-techno-noir look
that will surely rank high on
cinephiles must—see lists.
While 12 Monkeys has got
Lost Children beat with a
stronger, more disturbing
story, Lost Children ’s effects

make 12 Monkeys look like a ,

film school project. The City of
Lost Children has got a
showy, Cronenberg-does-
Disney aesthetic we’ve all
seen and geeked on before
with films of the Tim Burton
set.

A mad, mad, mad scientist
called Krank (Daniel Emilbork)
steals children for their
dreams because he’s lost the
ability to dream. When the sci-
entist’s - henchmen, the
Cyclops, steal One’s (Ron

Perlman) little brother, the

p|ot’s set in motion as One
and his band of rogueish chil-
dren work to free their kiddie
compatriots. We get some
truly strange characters in the
process with the Octupus,
who is something of a
Siamese relationship between
sisters. There's the main
Brain, brother to the cloned
Cyclops, who works to free
the children from the evil
clutches of the mad scientist.

The film’s mood is Alice in
Wonderland done with noir
effects as the city is shot using
a dark, somber palette of
black, purple and deep
greens. Caro’s camera pulls
all the stops_ with video images
and fisheye lenses in present-
ing this twisted nevernever-
land.

Although the ending seems
pat and the explosions are oh-
so-typical, the story is twisted
enough to keep us moving
along. Barring Dune, nobody
watches multi-million dollar
movies for inventive concepts
anyway, but we do watch for
inventive camera tricks. The
City of Lost Children is about
as sharp as they come from
this set, and you Gilliam fans
would be remiss to let this one
pass. -

 

opens this Friday at the Hex

are 7:30 and 9:45 p.m.

Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy
Directed by Kelly Makin

With David Foley, Bruce
McCuI|och, Kevin McDonald,
Mark McKinney, Scott
Thompson

Comedy is a brief history of
amazing Ietdowns. Especially
in recent disappointments by
producer Lorne Michaels with
Saturday Night Live,
Coneheads, Wayne’s World
Two, — ooh, weren’t they
awful? His latest film, howev-
er, is an extraordinarily funny
interpretation of an offbeat
television series.

The Kids in the Hall: Brain
Candy is a satiric story about
a mood-altering prescription
drug craze that sweeps the
nation. lt’s a funny movie writ-
ten by funny people. The crux
of Kids’ humor is its inside-
jokes. Throughout the movie,
small characters’ skits and
sudden character introduc-
tions appear like fresh anom-
alies. When the anti-depres-
sion pill receives the welcome
from the corporation execu-
tives, “the new guy,” played by
David Foley, is ecstatic. But
the team of scientists that
develops the drug has no idea
who he is. “Who are you?”

 “Ahh ..; I’m the new guy,” he ‘
The City of-Lost Children - =  ~- .  ~— ..

says, and leaves. The scien-
tists ponder and return to their
cheers. Slam, blam, thank you
ma’am, that was funny.

Brain Candy is made up
several skits with a consistant
theme. The movie begins with
a film noir monologue, where
a “voice” describes the pre-
sent, how things are now, how
everything was ‘distorted by a
product called “Gleemonex,”
the moniker for the depression
suppression pill. Like all skit
actors, the Kids play an
assembly of alternative char-
acters, ranging from the
angry-death singer (i.e. Glen
Danzig) to the Queen Mother.

The full-length film provides
the Kids an opportunity to
develop their characters more
fully. Kevin McDonald plays
Chris Cooper, a virgin with a
Ph.D. who is a scientist
obsessed with science. He
develops a pill that degener-
ates depression into a pill that
makes you feel as if it’s 72
degrees all the time. Cooper
transforms into a playboy of
the media field, appearing on
advertisements, chatting with
the 17-year-old dolls and gab-
bing on a talk show.

While Copper goes .on
enjoying the good-life, Alice,
played by Bruce McCuIloch,
plays the warm-hearted scien-
tist who has a teenage crush
on fellow scientist, Chris.

The protagonist, Don
Roritor, played by Mark
McKinney, is the megaloma-

niacal founder and chairman
of Floritor Pharmaceuticals,
the empirehe built on the phe-
nomenal success of his cre-
ation, the antacid “Stummies.”
His brief happiness is defeat-
ing penicillin as the most wide-
Iy prescribed medicine.

The schizophrenic of the
Kids is Scott Thompson,
whose primary character is
Mrs. Hurdicure, the first
human test subject to con-
sume “Gleemnox” and “Wa|ly."
He has everything: a loving
wife, two children, a house in
the suburbs but his
emphatic denial of his homo-
sexuality is the highlight of the
movie.

The Kids in the Hall series
was first broadcast on
Canada’s CBC from 1989 to
1994 and for three years on
HBO from 1989 to 1991. It
gained popularity with the
same sort of crowd that
acclaims “Flepo Man” and
“Cabin Boy” as staples of
quirky comedy, which is the
result of too much time in front
of Nickloden or Comedy
Central. The movie’s distorted
humor is worthy of class-
clown goofiness, where they
usually don't hesitate to bust
someone.

Guided By Voices
Under the Bushes Under the

. Stars

Matador Records

Here we go again. After
more than a decade of truly
independent recordings, three

. nationally-released, critically-

acclaimed records on the ever-
powerful Matador label and a
boxed set, Guided By Voices’
new record has been greeted
with the expected accusations
of somehow being too pol-

ished.

Huh? Is this for real?
Kim Deal produces ‘a couple
of tracks and suddenly its not

.“lo-fi” enough for those wax-

eared idiot rock critics who are
really in the know? ;
Sure, some of the songs
exceed forty seconds in length
(“epics,” as PD Williams put it),
and the drums are actually
audible on the whole thing, but

~ this record is a natural exten-

sion of GBV’s oeuvre, and I
don’t find it jarringly polished at
all.

Maybe I'm a little out of
touch -with mainstream con-
cerns (after all, I do write for
the VOX), but I've never
understood why someone like
my mom wouldn't like a band
like Guided By Voices or
Sebadoh. Nice, poppy guitar
rock, lots of songs about mem-
bers of the opposite sex, great
Beatle-esque vocal melodies;
what more could you ask for
from a Great American Band?

Well GBV singer Robert
Pollard tops all that with terrific
postmodern lyrical snippets
like “anyone can scratch, any-
one can win”, and “They cling
to the cinema, and they can't
find securityl then they finally
got recognized, so they leapt
in obscurity and misery.”

As with any pop outfit, the
(potentially) hit single is the
most important element on
“Under the Bushes,” and there
is no shortage of righteous
contenders on this one. In par-
ticular, check out “Cut Out
Witch,” “The Official lronmen
Rally Song” (with guitar by
Tripp Lampkins of the Grifters),
and “Acorns and Orioles,”
(which features guest piano by
John Shough). Remember,
guest appearances are not
automatically a sign of a slick
record, though they often do
indicate that the band in ques-
tion has received a lot of
recent press. W

I usually judge music first by
its ability to rock, and then by
its psychedelic appeal. GBV
shines through on both ends of
this spectrum, with enough
cool guitar pedals to add that
extra layer of comfort to the
uncertain longing of Pol|ard’s
lyncs.

I’m sure that no one who
enjoyed the last two records
will be disappointed by this
one. My first impression was
that it contained some filler
material, but after two more

play-throughs, I’m convinced
that every song is a classic,
and that’s all that needs to be
said.

(This piece of shit review is
dedicated -to Guided By Voices
fan Jesse Smith, who died ear-
lier this week at his home in
Columbus. He will be missed
by anyone who ever knew him.
We all love you, Smith.)

Slayer
Undisputed Attitude
American

Back in the late ‘80s, Slayer
provided the soundtrack to my
unfocused adolescent rage, as
well as the rage of millions of
others. So when I got hold of
an advance copy of their new
album, Undisputed Attitude, I
was eager to hearif they still
had it. In other words, can the
devil still rock?

The new album is all punk
covers, with bands like the
Adolescents, Minor Threat and
T.S.O.L. being paid homage.

The first thing that struck me.

was how simple and direct this
music was compared to the
Slayer of yesteryear. There
were a lot less guitar solos,
and the _riffs were more
straightforward. This is a big
change from anything they've

done before. I like most of the ~

bands whose songs were cho-
sen for inclusion on this album,
and Slayer’s versions are all
pretty straightforward,
although faster and heavier.

The question in my mind is,
why did they bother doing
this? I mean, Metallica did a
punk cover thing years ago,
and they just put out an*e.p.
Why release a whole album of
songs that are not only not
written by the band, but are
also different enough in style
to potentially alienate their for-
mer audience? I hope there’s
enough room on this punk
bandwagon thing, because
Slayer wants to hop on.

The worst sin on the album
occurs when Slayer attempts
to do Minor Threat’s “I Don’t
Want To Hear It.’’ For those
who don’t know, Minor Threat
started the straightedge, a
movement that eschews the
use of alcohol. However, the
Slayer members are all
drunks, so they changed the
lyrics. Instead of the original,
“You picked up a bottle/ and
you changed,” Slayer gives us,
“You picked up a Bible 
Huh?! Sure, the song is
played great, but it typifies
everything wrong with this
album; everything is done
technically well, but the soul
has been sucked out of the
originals. The last song on the
album, “Gemini,” is the only
song written by Slayer. it’s
slower than anything else
they’ve ever done, and has a
lot of interesting high guitar
work going on during the vers-
es. Let’s hope for the sake of
devilrockers everywhere that

they get it in gear and give us
a whole album of songs like
this one soon. It's the one
high point of this album.

Sepultura

Roots -

Sepultura started out as
what Slayer referred to as a
“Slayer-Baby.” With the new
album Roots, the students
have definitely surpassed the
master. The guitar work and
the screaming guttural vocals
are up to par, but the thing that
really puts this album over the
top is the rhythm? section.
Instead of just mimicking the
gu'itar the way most metal
bassists tend to, Paulo Jr.
writes parts that stand out, and
it has lots of tasty little fills all
over the place. The drummer,
Igor Cavalera, play in a style I
wouldn't expect with a metal
band, but it works. His drum-
ming is very tribal. The overall
effect sounds like Slayer (back
when they were good) with the
Grateful Dead's percussion

section. This is best typified by .

the song “Istari,” an all-
acoustic (I?) track with tribal
singing. This kind of thing

would have been unheard of .

for a metal band to do a cou-
ple of years ago. Sepultura is
taking a lot of chances here,
and they pull them off pretty
admirably.

Disco Crisis
demo _

Disco Crisis is a local punk
band that has just put out its
demo. It’s short (four songs),
but it gets the job done. Fast,
catchy songs with screechy
female vocals. The highlight,
“Wake Up,” deals with sexism
within the punk scene. So you
can dance to it and think. And
that’s what it’s all about.
Forget that Slayer stuff — get
yourself some real punk.

Model Citizens
40 oz. Salvation

Model Citizens are a local
punk band that put out their
demo, 40 oz. Salvation,
recently. There’re eight songs
on this, and while they play
bouncy ska-core, the recording
leaves a bit to be desired. The
songs are strong enough that I
can overlook that, though. At
least it sounds better than that
over-produced garbage that
Epitaph shovels down our
throats and calls punk. Some
of the songs have a strong
Operation Ivy influence,
although the new songs that
they’ve been playing live
recently seem to have shed
this. Watch these guys. I pre-
dict they’ll be big in a year. Get
the demo, and get a head
start. Write: NoFi

Dexter Romweber

folk SONGS
Permanent Records

The cult of Dexter, complete
with the availability of a $1.50
Dexter comb, will rejoice with
the release of his first full-
length solo album, folk
SONGS. The recording fea-
tures the guitar player from the
Flat Duo Jets, Dexter
Romweber and a collection of
27 songs done on a four-track
in his mother’s bathroom.
While fitting easily into the
style of the Jets, this recording
ventures into territory never
before encountered — pseu-
do-classical. The range of
influences on the recording
vary from Bach to Baker

(Knight and Eddie Cochran.

The solo title is no joke; no
one else plays on this release
except Dexter, the man him-
self.

One of the most interesting
aspects off this album is the
packaging. All of the paintings
which grace the insert are
Dexter originals. The use of
the paintings is indicative of
the general breakdown of the
boundaries around music. He
discusses art, music, literature
and Errol Flynn in the liner
notes. Order forms included on
the inside advertise the cult of
Dexter with items ranging from
the typical tapes and stickers
to the infamous Dexter comb.

The musicon the album is,
as is to be expected, superb.
Dexter says, “The money
[spent] on high-tech equipment
does not improve a take. I still
believe a hit record could be
made on a four-track or less.’’
Others agree with this state-
ment, like Guided By Voices,
Sebadoh or Pavement. With
the loss of the construct of
“band,” this album is very intro-
spective without shafting his
bandmember Crow during the
mix. He talks about Crow in
the notes and includes a ver-
sion of “Please, Please'Baby”
from the Jets’ first release on
the new album. The ghosts ‘of
Tom Waits and Nick Cave also
are present on the tracks “13
Women” and “Marching

Diamonds,” which is a big

departure from the usual

-sound of Dexter.

If I have to say this one more
time I'll puke, but Dexter rules.
My check is in the mail for the
goddamned Dexter comb.

Vehicle Flips
“Impressed beyond Belief’ b/w
“Formula Rejection
Song”&”Citronella” ‘
Hemmiola Records

Why is it that, when the
words “pop” and “music” are

-millenium?”

combined, many local scen-
esters cringe? Perhaps the
word “pop” has too many neg-
ative connotations for the hip
indie elite: common, popular,
easily digestable. Does music
have to sound complicated,
loud or obtuse to be impor-
tant? If it does, I am happy to
enjoy and stand behind the
unimportant. Vehicle Flips are
one "of the few local acts that
concern themselves with the
good old-fashioned pop song.
Verse-chorus-verse, whatever.
I'm talking lush, juicy hooks
that you can hum along with,
toe tap along with. From the
Beatles, Beach Boys, Kinks, to
Unrest, Vehicle Flips continue
in a long tradition of smart,
well-crafted popular music.
Yes, there’s much more to
VF than boring clichés -
there’s substance. On their lat-
est single for Impressed
Beyond Belief, the band has
perfected its form and delivers
two of its greatest songs to
date. The first, the title song, is
a shimmering example of the
VF smart-pop formula. Jeff
and Frank’s guitars are oh-so-
clean, chiming and strumming
a backdrop for Tim's melodic
bassline that never seems to
get in the way of Craig’s snap-

.py beats or Frank’s vocals.
Frank has that relaxed, kind- '

of-on-the-shy-side approach to

singing, but the words are
‘clear and enunciated. I have to

admit, on this single it’s the
lyrics that really get me. Frank
has the ability to spin a very lit-
erate narrative without sound-
ing epically brash or hopeless-
ly sappy-

nstead, the listener gets a
witty glimpse of a man in a
Midwestern airport contemplat-
ing a newspaper article about
a total solar eclipse, only to
come to the conclusion: “And I
think when it comes to hype
here’s something pretty much
immune/It’s kind of exciting,
kind of inviting, kind of in con-
trast to the rest of my life ...” A
chorus of “doo doo doo doos”
follows, putting everything in
perspective. Kudos also to Jeff
for playing a great solo melody
— he doesn’t fly off the han-
dle, ruining the song’s aesthet-
ic; he doesn’t overplay.

The second, “Formula
Rejection Song,” is similarly
tongue-in-cheek in a self-con-
scious way. It simply is a mid-
tempo list of potentional rejec-
tion lines delivered to the
song's protagonist: “Will you
send me off like a post dated
rent check  Will you rip me
off like Pink Floyd at 3 Rivers
Stadium  Will you count me
off like the last seconds of the
What's more
humorous is that song offers
no catharsis, no conclusion,
not even a snappy retort; it’s
justa list.

The final offering,
“Citronella,” is an instrumental
number. Like the name

For my final column of the
school year, I would like to list
my five personal favorite zines
that I have read since I started
doing this column. Please note,
not all of the zines were actual-
ly reviewed in this column, and
they are listed in no particular
order. _

DlY:An A-Z Guide to
Doing-It-Yourself . . . Over
100 pages of how-to from auto
repair to zines. If you can’t
learn something useful from
this, you’re not trying hard
enough. $3 ppd. to: PO Box
720716/ San Jose, CA 95172.

Action Girl is an all-female
comics anthology that comes
out quarterly. Don’t worry
about the all-female thing
being off-putting, because the
more important thing is that it’s
all-good. This is the best
anthology of underground
comicsjgoing right now. It
should be stocked in any
decent comic book store. If it’s
not, ask for it. They can get it.

Punk Planet is like
MaximumRockNRolI, only not
as separatist and easier to
read. It also includes fiction
and articles. This zine is my
standard bathroom reading.
Send $2 for the latest issue to:
PO Box 1711/ Hoboken, NJ
07030-9998.

Fucktooth is chock full 0’ vit-
amins and-rants. There’re a lot
of well-written articles on a
wide range of subjects in here.
The issue I’m looking at (#17)
has ones on tattoos and the
origins of ska for starters. Send
$1 and a stamp to: PO Box

passion, but I love To Mend A
Man . . . Send $1 to 235

If you guys take away any-
thing from reading my column,
I want it to be the knowledge
that you can do anything that
you want to do. If you want to

do a zine, don’t talk about it, .

just do it. If you want to be in a
band and put out tapes or
records, just do it. Don’t worry
about whether or not you can
even play, don’t worry that no
one likes you, just start by tap-
ing yourself on a boom box
and sell copies for a couple
bucks each. Get involved! I
want everyone who is reading
this to do something that
you’ve always wanted to do,
but haven’t gotten around to
doing yet, this summer. Don’t
listen to anyone who tells you
that you can’t or that you have
to wait until you are more
experienced. Because you only
get one chance, and this is it.
And support the people who
are out there doin’ it. That guy
next to you in the library might
be in a band that tons of peo-
ple love, that girl across from
your apartment might do a zine
that gets distributed across the
nation, and you would never
know it to look at them.
Because the only difference

between you and them is that
they did it, and you just thought
about it.

If anyone wants to do a zine
over the summer, just make up
10 or so copies at first. Send
these out for review, send
these to any zine distributors
that you know of and take them
to any stores that sell zines.
Send me a copy, too. If you do
this, you should start to get
orders, and then you can print
up more copies as needed.
That way, you won’t have to
invest a lot of money in photo-
copies at first. Of course, if you

-have a scam for free copies

going, just disregard this and
print up a thousand copies at
the beginning. Here are a few
addresses to get you started:

the butt-smack that spilled a

To the hecklers and flakes that

phattest song on this album
has to be brought to us by
. Passion in the form of “As

I The...” If you’ve heard
I‘ “Pay Per View" by
 2 Keith Murray, then
' . you know who she is.
Her voice is rugged,
' reminiscent of Nefertiti, but
the flow is ill. She freaks the
buttah smooth track, breathing
life into an otherwise dead
album.

The rest of the album leaves
a whole helluva lot to be
desired. Jamal failed to show
any real skills on “Beez Like
That.” Even Erick’s sister
(remember her rom the studio
skit on his album?) failed to
show anything on “On The
Regular.” The talent that was
displayed was truly not Def
Squad caliber. ,

Insomnia has its moments,
even though they’re very few
and far between. Listen before
purchasing; that’s the credo for
this.one.

April 1 8 1 996
for singles off the first album
helped us to get a peek at
what was to come for the next
joint.

Their music took a turn for
the better when they took con-
trol of producing themselves.
in fact, they did most of this
album. The production has
such a wide span, but still
within a parameter. From
sparse drums with rich music
(“Ready Or Not”), heavy
drums with a calypso kind of
feel (“Fu-Gee-La"), acoustic
guitar with a live feel (“No
Woman, No Cry”), to hard
core hip-hop tracks with real
vocals (“Killing Me Softly").
Th-is album lacks nowhere.
Wycief, Lauryn, and even
Pras (I?!) show what their
made of. Even the skits are
phat This is the investment of
the year. Plain & simple: if you
don’t already own it, quit sell-
ing those oranges on the free-
way and go get it.

I was also gonna review
Bahamadia, but to be totally
honest, I haven't listened to it
all the way through. I wouldn't
do it any real justice if-I half-
assed that one.- What I've
heard of it, it’s.phat. She's rep-
resenting Philly to the fullest.

In the meantime, I gotta be
out and handle my business.
Respect to those that give it,
middle finger with cailouses to
those that don’t. History like
1995.

Jack Drag

Jack Drag ,
Devil’s Weed, Inc

When I first heard this, I was
able to pick out many influ-
ences, including My Bloody
Valentine, the Swirlies and
Ride, musically and some-
times vocally. Yet Jack Drag
are not thieves. lt’s not that
they stole from the aforemen-
tioned bands, but it’s how they
manipulated the music by
adding, or even stripping,
instrumental elements that
makes this release worthy of
any attention.

Jack Drag begins with

 

“Velour,” introducing the listen-
er to their raw version of the
average track off Ride’s Smile.
They serve up a bit of drone in
their guitar style, but what
sticks in my head is the use of
those “earthy” instruments, the
kind that too many bands are
straying from these days. A
hint of tambourine, followed by
an instant accompaniment of a
pair of maracas, gives Jack
Drag the ability to categorize
their music into multiple gen-
res as the listener simply sits
there and adjusts his head-
phones.

Let’s say, however, that you
are really only looking for a
good song or two to try out on
your new XBass car stereo
(complete with four speakers).
There’s room for you, too.
Check out “There Was A
Moon” and “Dopebox” for a
good, feel-it-in-your-chest lis-
ten, one comparable to a wide
variety of house music.

There’re even the way-intel-
ligent lyrics, like “Fuck you and
all of your friends/ I hope I

never ever see you again/ This
is for the time you pulled out
my hair,” from “Friends" (the
song, not the show), which
give the impressionable some-
thing substantial to sing along
to. On the flipside, a line from
“Loop," ‘‘I disagree but I'll try to
understand,” tells the adult
society that these songs are
not all based on negativity,
that the band has good inter-
personal skills.

What I like even better is the
extensive use and abuse of
their guitars. The riffs they got
out of those babies, what
would we do without distortion
pedals? After numerous lis-
tens to “Friends,” I was able to
detect seven different guitar
sounds, ranging from wavy
acoustic to hard-core hollow
electric. I have to admit, the
multi-guitar solo is delivered
fresh and comes out nice and
clean -— guitars coming at you
from all directions.

Jack Drag seems to have
adopted the vintage Casio’s
standard automatic beat-box

it’s been cloned by millions of
cheap toy factories all over
Taiwan. Lay this underneath a
formulaic MBV tune, and you’ll

Each of the songs have hol-
low off-beat drums, a bit remi-
niscent of old Violent Femmes,
all giving me what I paid for.
But there’s always a ‘‘black
sheep” of the CD. This comes
in the form of “Space 67,” a
so-called song which tediously
explores the workings of weird
guitarfeedback. That's all, no
vocals. '

Jack Drag’s self-titled disc is
an eclectic ensemble of music;
here one could righteously
mistake it for a good movie
soundtrack. The CD had the
negative potential for coming
across as “loud" due to the
variety of mixes, but being a
compilation of four-track
recordings, they kept the lo-fi

' April 18 1996

profile. The combinations used
constantly keep the listener
interested. For example, in
“There Was A Moon," I hear
jungle drums coupled with
ancient organ tones and funky
bass chords. Yet in “Hail the
Caffeine Dream,” my appetite
is still satisfied by the low,
droney, androgenous vocals
and a four-tone guitar.

Overall, Jack,Drag delivers
mellow music, leaving a mild
taste.

‘‘I got that head-nod shit that

WOO HAH! Got you all in
chec 

Although Busta’s first single
release “WOO HAH! Got You
All In Check” is stolen from the
Beastie Boys (listen to Paul's
Boutique) and is plastered all
over MTV and the pop air
waves, it’s still bangin’. His call-
and-response synthesized
Candyland melody is laced with

a lyrical nonsense, which from

anyone else might raise an
eyebrow or two and then be
turned off. But this is Busta —
and Busta is synonymous with
nonsense.

Busta’s nonsensical rhymes
root back to his LONS days.
But it wasn't until he began per-
forming on almost every remix 0
(Craig Mack’s “Flavor in Your
Ear,” Tribe Called Quest’s
“Scenario,” Panther’s “The
Points”) in the last couple of
years that people started think-
ing he was on some of that on-
the-next-shit. Now, after morph-
ing into man-dragon, putting his
hair up like Princess Leia and
claiming he had to go pick up
his man Saddam Hussein, it’s
confirmed — he is on some of
that on-the-next-shit.

“Ya’ll think fast, before I get

- all in your ass/ In your frame

like Plexiglass.”

Listening to “Do My Thing,”
like most of the album, you
would think there’s an army of
Bustas contributing because of

the layers upon layers of-

laughs, ha’s and background
noises. It's like Busta is every-
where. But while his vocals are
omnipresent and hectic, the
tracks are simple but kickin’. In
“Ill Vibe” featuring Q-Tip, the
hypnotic beat is mixed with "a
chimey synthesizer with Busta
flowing about how his ass was
constipated — “too much extra
cheese.” It doesn't make much
sense, but it makes your head
nod. .

Besides Q-Tip, Busta fea-

School reunion. The reunion,
“Keep it Movin”’ starts off with
an upright bass kicking with
Charlie Brown singing the cho-
rus. As the lyrics come in, the
slow beat picks up snare and,
in traditional LONS form, the
group punctuates words and
sounds in unison. It sounds as
though they never broke up (or
did they?).

“Damn, if I had just a little bit
more time. lfl only known
before what I know now, days
would be better.” Talk about
dramatic endings; in Busta’s
conclusion. “The End of the
World (Outro)” he mixes _a
haunting laugh with the classi-

lt’s undoubtedly the best 45

The For Carnation

Marshmallows
Matador

Yet another rock-out indie
supergroup, the For Carnation
are the brainchild of ex-Slint
guitarist Brian McMahan, with
some friends along for the ride.
It's the Brian McMahan show,
and it’s beautiful. Featuring
such folks as Dave Pajo, Doub
McCombs, John Herndon, John
Weiss, Tim Ruth and even
Brian’s own little brother Mike,
the For Carnation are indie-
cred defined, but don‘t hold it
against them; their records are

actually really good.

Their second record overall,
Marshmallows pretty much con-
tinues on in the same vein as
the first record, but minus the
rockers (see “how I beat the
devil” on Fight Songs). A lot of
this record consists of repeated
riffs in odd time signatures and
whispered/sung vocals a la
Slint, but with a lot more focus
on melody and silence.
Lyrically, McMahan has gone
away from the short-narrative
styled lyrics that I so loved on
Spiderland, but is still singing
about topics that one does not
usually associate with rock
music.

The albums starts with “On
the Swing,” a song that could fit
right in on Fight Songs . Using
no more instrumentation than
absolutely necessary and as a
means to move the song along
and bring it to an end, “On the
Swing” sets the tone for the
entire record.

While most of the songs on
this album are based mostly
around a repeated guitar riff,
each one creates a different
atmosphere and mood through
the use of varied instrumenta-
tion and sound. While “On the
Swing" gives one a feeling of
sadness that is all the while
hopeful, “I Wear the Gold,” with
its swooshy keyboards and lack
of vocals takes on a sinister
vibe. Track three, “Lmyr,
Marshmallow,” is a quiet,
almost country ballad about
sword. This song was really
beautiful when I saw them live
last February, but on the record
they've added keyboard chime
sound that really detracts from
the song. “Lmyr, Marshmallow”

Q

is really the only let-down on
this record, and not much of
one at that.

“Winter Lair,” with its splash-
ing, ringing symbols, quiet
instrumentation and living-in-a-
cave lyrics leaves one with a
feeling of desolation of claus-
trophobia.

“Salo” is a more band orient-
ed piece and features a steady
keyboard “blip” not unlike the
sound one might associate
with a submarine. The drums
play a bigger role here and
there are more chord changes
than usual. A welcome
change.

The record closes with
“Preparing to Receive You,”
and while it too consists of
nothing more than a single
repeated phrase on guitar,
bass and drums, it ends leav-
ing you with a feeling of clo-
sure but also that they are
moving on, that there’s more

9

to come.

The For Carnation have
some growing to do, but
already they are carving out a
little corner for themselves in
music that, like Slint in ‘91,
really has no peer. Each song
is quite different but when put
together they create an album
of sad, affecting beauty that
leaves one wanting more. Not
as good as Fight Songs but
fantastic nonetheless,
Marshmallows carries on an
idea that began years ago with
Slint and takesit to another
level. If you have the means,
check out this record. You
won’t be disappointed.

ernists among us.

Elliot Sharp and Zeena
Parkins perform Monday, April
29th, at the Oakland Beehive.
Show begins at 8 pm and is
all ages.

What would happen if eso-
teric indie-rock was puree-d in
a blender? Well, you’d proba-

- bly end up with something like

Retsin, fronted by Rodan’s
Cynthia Nelson and Ruby
Falls’ Tara O’ Neil. The
women met on the set of the
indie rockbuster “Half-
Cocked,” a movie which
showcases the acting talents
of the two guitarists/vocalists
and a soundtrack featuring
songs that they wrote and per-
formed together. Tara and
Cynthia had so much fun col-
laborating that they decided to
pursue the Retsin flavor to its
fuller potential. Their latest
release, “Egg Fusion,” kicks
out some folky slide-guitar

jamz set to intense distortion _

thrombosis, described as a
“country-meets-punk” fusion
by those in-the-know. l'-letsin’s
tough rural edge will make
you wish you could play the
fiddle, and that’s a fine
enough reason to see them
perform this Tuesday.
Opening acts are local
“seraphims of sorrow,” The
Karl Hendricks Trio, and
Kansas residents Panel
Donor. '
Fletsin, Karl Hendricks Trio,
and Panel Donor -play
Tuesday, April 23, at the
Oakland Beehive. Show
begins at 8pm and is all ages.

Just when you thoughtit
was safe to put away your
wool sweaters until next win-
ter, Cloud 9 brings a show
which will leave razor-like ici-
cles dangling from remnants
of your damaged psyche and
chill your vertebrae out of
proper alignment. Zeni Geva,
whose sound defines crunch
to the core, rock out with
songs about nihilism and hate
like they were the Japanese
pen pals of Ministry, but boast
more punk credibility than
their American compatriots.
Zeni’s upcoming performance
should be an interesting gig
not only musically but visually,
judging from the “Asian Satan”
appearance of frontman Kazu
K. Null. It would be wise not to
yell any jokes about “Kazoos”
during their set, or Mr. Null
might curse you with an incur-
able virus. Read the lyrics
sheet of their latest album
“Freedom Bondage,” and
you'll see what I mean. Zeni
Geva are eponymous for
hammering out riffs that are
like unsmoothed concrete to
the eardrums, and so much
distortion means that your
brain will be a soft gel by the
end of the apocalyptic all.
Zeni Geva, Today is the Day,
stinking Lizaveta, and local
rockers Shale, perform
Sunday, May 5, at Cloud 9 in
the Strip District. Show begins
at 8 pm and is all ages.

Knit from the leftover threads
of Heavens to Betsy and
Excuse 17 comes S|eater-
Kinney, a trio hailing from
Olympia, Washington who are
on tour in support of their sec-
ond record, “Call the Doctor.”
Sleater-Kinney play no-bass,
in-your-face rawhk, peppering
their spicy post-punk sound
with bitter tales for the Iovelorn
and lost. Their surly-grrl
appraoch disprovs the myth
that the Pacific Northwest is
still justa grunge factory.
Joining Sleater-Kinney .
is Vineland, the latest creation
of ex-Bitch Magnet guitarist
Jon Fine. Vineland’s new 7”
(Zero Sum) picks up where

, Slint left off, showcasing some

fierce guitar strumming that will
please all ears friendly with the
prickly sounds of
“Spiderland”’s julienned-pota-
toes Stratocraft. Filling out the
evening’s dance card are
locals Storm ‘N’ Stress, a band
that generates lots of excite-
ment without making *too*
much noise.

Sleater-Kinney, Vineland, and

Storm ‘N’ Stress perform.

Thursday, April 18, at
Luciano’s. Show starts at 9pm
and is all ages.

They may not be selling mil-
lions of records or winning
heaps of Brit Awards any time
soon, but Boyracer have
achieved oodles of critical
-acclaim with their precocious
pop concoctions. Contending
with the pseudo-punk postur-
ing of fellow countrymen
Oasis, Boyracer have side-
stepped all the early sixties-
revivalism that has turned
England «into a nation of mod
cons, injecting some good ol’-'
fashioned moxie into the
scene. In the early days
Boyracer funded their first two
records with money earned
from selling zucchini, proving
that they didn’t need no Albini
to help then retain their raw
sound. Boyracer’s latest offer-
ing, “in Full Colour,” proves
that these folks are as genuine
as grandma’s wedding ring.
Short, sweet, and to the point,
the tracks on ‘‘Full’’ highlight
the band’s schizophrenic ver-
satility, with a broad spectrum
of influences brilliantly meshed
into one delicious stew. Their
upcoming Pittsburgh appear-
ance should earn them much
approval among the locals.
Appearing with Boyracer are
NY’s power prog-rock trio
Babe the Blue Ox, and local
indie pop heroes Vehicle Flips.
Yummy yummy!

Boyracer, Babe the Blue Ox,
and Vehicle Flips at the
Bloomfield Bridge Tavern,
Thursday, May 2. Show starts
at 9pm and is over21.
