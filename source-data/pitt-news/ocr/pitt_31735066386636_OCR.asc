BAS ﬁghts for representation on search committee

By Jennifer Calabrese
News Editor

Over 100 Black Action Society

elrxfrlembers caused an uproar at

Thursday’s open presidential-
search hearing for students.

“We as members of the Black
Action Society's political action
committee, being of uniﬁed
thought and mind, state our
strongest disapproval of the elitist,
non—democratic process that was
used to give the student body

nhtoken representation on the
presidential—search committee,”
said Justin Laing, chairperson of
the BAS political action
committee.

“We are insulted by the notion
that the students, without whom
there would be no university, are
considered insigniﬁcant enough
to receive one representative

“while those who don't even pay
Ha dime to go here have greater
impact in the selection process
than we who pay thousands of
dollars.

“In rejecting the idea of one
student, we strongly suggest the
appointment of three

undergraduate representatives
selected by the BAS. We urge the
search committee and whomever
else is responsible for making the
necessary changes to contact us
by Nov. 21, 1990, 12 noon,
because if the issue is not dealt
with by this time, the chances of
solving this problem orderly and
peacefully will decline drastically.
Thank you for your time and we
trust this problem will be
corrected quickly and effectively, ”
said Laing.

Laing’s prepared statement was
interrupted by Student
Government Board PresidentJulie
Shepard, who yelled, “Excuse me,
Justin, I am very sorry, but we are
trying to keep this focused. As I
said ...,” midway through his
speech. BAS members drowned
out the rest of what she was
saying with chants of “Go on, go
on. Speak brother, speak.”

When Laing ﬁnished, BAS
member Marcus Guy stood and
repeated the same prepared
statement. Shepard interrupted
with, “Excuse me,” but Guy
finished the speech. Two other
BAS members repeated the

statement again, until presidential-
search committee Chairperson
Farrell Rubenstein addressed the
group.

‘We have heard your message
very clearly, I don't think it is
necessary to repeat it one more
time  Why don't you talk about
what the issues are and what
your concerns are? If anybody
else wants to give [the speech],
then we will just have to close the
meeting,” Rubenstein said.

Laing told Rubenstein that he
would not talk about the issues
since the BAS political action
committee was there to try to get
Rubenstein to agree to meet with
them to discuss the possibility of
additions to the search committee.

After Rubenstein told Laing that
he refused to meet with him on
set conditions, Laing asked why
Rubenstein had agreed to meet
with the BAS before this.

Rubenstein replied, “Let me try
to put it to you this way — we are
not going to have a 30,000-person
committee. We are a collection of
people that are trying to get ideas.
I will meet with you to get your
ideas. I will not meet with you to

Both Student Government Board President Julie Shepard
and Black Action Society political action committee Chairperson
Justin Laing disapprove of each other’s actions at the open
presidential—search hearing for students.

Shepard, who interrupted the BAS members several times
when they read a statement demanding the addition of three
black students to the search committee, said that the BAS action
last Thursday was not appropriate.

“That was not the place to do what they did,” she said. “I think

University to install
new locks in Lothrop

By Jim Wechsler
Stqﬂ‘ Writer

The missing master key to
Lothrop Hall will cease to be a
threat to students’ safety
tomorrow when a new lock will
be installed on each of the
building’s 680 dormitory rooms.

The new locks are the latest
effort by the University of
Pittsburgh to secure the residence
hall and protect its residents.
Numerous plainclothes police
have been patrolling the building
since the key was discovered to
be missing last Sunday.

An investigation by the campus

police has yet to produce the .

key. The inquiry is also attempting
to determine the circumstances
of the key’s disappearance.

“You can be sure that we will
thoroughly examine everything
that happened,” said Bob
Reteshka, a spokesperson for the
university. 'Reteshka said that if
any ﬂaws are found in the present
security measures, they will be
corrected. Reteshka added that
the current policy has been
followed for many years and that
the system itself may not be at
fault

Under the current key—security
policy, 16 people had access to
the master key.

The cost to replace the locks
will be $28,000. Reteshka said
that a majority of the money to
pay for the locks will be deducted

from the $1 million previously
allocated for the renovation of
Lothrop Hall.

Installation of the new locks is
expected to be completed on
Tuesday. .

“We’re going to pay som
people some overtime and do it
all in one day,” said Reteshka.

Most Lothrop Hall residents
agree that they will feel safe once
the new locks are installed,
according to a survey taken
yesterday at the residence hall.
The question asked was, “Do
you think you will feel safe when
the new locks are installed [on
Tuesdayl?”

Of the 100 Lothrop residents
polled, 80 percent said that they
thought they would. However,
most of these students added that
sleep would not come easily if
the new locks were not in place
before they left for Thanksgiving
break.

Eleven percent of the students
polled said that the new locks do
not bring them relief. Some said
that the new key could be taken
as easily as the old one. Others
said that enough crimes occur at
the university even when the
master key was secured that they
are dissatisﬁed with campus
security.

The remaining 9 percent said
that they would feel better with
the new locks in, but they still
had doubts about campus
security.

interests at the hearing.

“Julie is not obviously on the
side of the students. Julie is just a
puppet of the trustees," Laing
said. “When she had obviously
made a mistake  that the whole
student body reacted to
negatively, when people stood
up to say it was wrong, Julie
stood on the side of the trustees."

Shepard said that she has
limited power with the Board of
Trustees and has written a letter
to BOT Chairpersonjohn Marous,
requesting that more stu-dents
be added to the search committee
Her request was denied.

“The way that I handled myself
last night, I feel was completely
appropriate. I was serving in the
position of a moderator. In keep-
ing the entire event focused, I did
what I felt necessary," she said.

Laing said that he also

disapproved of Rubenstein’s
actions at the hearing.

“Rubenstein’s attitude yesterday
— anyone who was there could
see how arrogant he was.

“Rubenstein’s whole point of
view is, ‘I won't be manipulated.
There are certain rules that you
must follow, and if you go out of
those rules that I have set, then
you can't talk to me,”' Laing said.

Laing said that the committee
demanded three representatives
for several reasons, including
“making sure tuition doesn’t

continue to increase, making sure ,

our student fees don’t increase
without us understanding why,
making sure that there’s more
black faculty, women faculty and
black student retention.”

“We want to put two or three
students that we select [on the
committee]. And it’s not just the
fact that we’re black students. It's
that black students, I think, that
would be beneficial to the whole
university because we’re at the
bottom. So when we vote for
something, it goes all the way
through. If we’re worried about
tuition, it’s going to effect
everyone," he said.

“We’re not asking for two or

black people. We’re saying that‘
the Student Government Board
— the leadership of,_ I guess, the
European-American community
—— didn’t stand up, and that we’re
standing up for the rest of the
university,” Laing said

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Monday, November 19, 1990

at this and say, ‘This is a leftover
from the ’60s and the ’70s. And
yes, legislation did pass, and
different things did happen be-
cause Of that, but this is the 90s,
and those same tactics are not
viewed in the same way as what

“We see no contradiction
between there being three black
students and one white student
and it being non-representative.
Because they said [Lisa Campoli]
could represent us, but we see no
reason why we can’t represent
them,” Laing said.

Shepard said that she thinks
the political action comrnittee’s
demands are unrealistic.

“I see the fact that they asked
for three students as being
perhaps a method of over-
compensating, thus hoping to
get at least one. The fact that they
have decided to present their
concerns in this way, I think,
hinders their chances of getting
anyone On,” she said.

Shepard said that the BAS com-
mittee’s actions may be outdated.

“I think too many people look

they were before.’ Like I said,
they are not looked at as respons-
ible, intellectual open means of
getting to an end,3’ she said.

Laing pointed to a different
historical reference.

“Often in history, black students
have been the ones who have
acted and then other people have
mobilized after them. That's how
the women's movement started.
That's how the Vietnam
movement started,” he said.

Laing said that the BAS political
action committee interprets the
search committee’s response to
mean, “‘You are little children,
and you’re not ready for this kind
of stuff. This is adult stuff, kids.
We'll give you a good president,
so shut up. Know your place.’
But we’re not going to shut up.”

BAS

Continued from page 1
let’s not talk about it.”

Laing then said that the BAS
was going to leave, since
Rubenstein refused to talk about
more student representation.

The 24—member presidential-
search committee, which is made
up of faculty, trustees, alumni
and local ﬁgures, includes two
students, undergraduate Lisa
Campoli and graduate student
Lisa Ryan.

The BAS has strongly criticized
Shepard’s appointment of
Campoli, a decision thatwas made
without input from student
groups. last month, the BAS called
for Campoli’s resignation.

After the BAS representatives
left the room, the hearing
continued with suggestions about
the new president from several
students.

oRoger Campbell said the new
president needs to be a bold man
with a vision for the university.

“Today the infrastructure is in
place to really put Pitt on the map
academically. I think what we
should be looking for is someone
who is not afraid to make some
serious demands on the
university’s constituencies for the
achievement of that level of
excellence,” he said.

Campbell added that the new
president should be able to look
someone in the eye and give
them some numbers that will
shock them.

“My own judgment is that for

 

Pitt to be where it ought to be at
the end of the millennium is
going to require probably raising

something in the order of a billion

dollars. It is an enormous thing to
do. I happen to think the capacity
is there. I think people respond
well to a challenge,” he said.

Campbell said Pitt should not
close itself to innovative
possibilities.

“It may well be that one man is
incapable of doing this job. A
number of universities have set
up a structure where you have a
president and a chancellor, one
of whom is an educational
philosopher and an administrator
and one of whom is a fund—raiser
and a doer," he said.

Pitt’s current budgetary
problems will give the new
president a chance to make
serious decisions about priorities,
Campbell said.

“I am going to say some things
that will probably offend some
people, but I would hope that
some of the professional schools
would be evaluated as to their
relevance to the university's core
mission. I also have to question
whether Pitt in fact ought to be in
the branch—campus business, ” he
said.

-Graduate student Ben
DeDominicis said that the most
important characteristic for the
new president to have is the
ability to raise money. T

“Obviously, if we can ﬁnd

somebody who could both raise

money and also has a wonderful
academic background and has a
national reputation as a scholar,
that would be wonderful, but I
think the most important
capability of this person should
be his or her ability to bring in
the cash,” he said.

“What we want is someone
who has experience raising
money and is connected.
Preferably someone, for example,
who has served in high political
office, who would like to come
to Pitt and stay at Pitt, someone
who perhaps is an ex—CEO in a
major corporation,” he said.

0Kurt Weinschenker said that
the new president should be
concerned with “people, people,
people.”

“I would like to see a president
that would at least talk to the
students [and] talk to the staff at
least half of the time. And brief
his staff on what he has learned,
and then his staff, who is
supposed to be handling the
administrative functions, can brief
him on what he needs to know
to lead the university. I don’t
think that is asking too much of
a prospective presidential
candidate,” he said.

-Graduate student Sarah
Patrick said that the new president
should focus on the ethics of
research and publishing. She
added that Pitt needs to pay
more attention to ﬁnancial aid,

especially for graduate students.

-Kevin Riley, a graduate

student and a CAS adviser, said
the new president should “get
out and see the students.”

“The president can go to two or
three classes a year because two
or three hours out of his time out
of the year is not that much,” he
said.

From an adviser’s standpoint,
Pitt needs to add more core
courses because they close too
quickly, Riley said.

“CAS and FAS are getting milked
again. They raise tuition and admit

Justin Laing argues with Farrell Rubenstein at last Thursday‘s meeting.

more students but don’t increase
the faculty and the courses. The
new president should look at a
better allocation of the school’s
resources," he said.

-Graduate student Erick Ishii
said that the new president should
get rid of Pitt’s current “publish or
perish” idea, which brings the
quality of teaching down.

“We either have to have
professors ease off research or
hire professors just for educational
purposes,” he said.

Pitt beats Melbourne, anxious for season opener

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

After weeks of slamming and pushing
and elbowing each other in practice, the
Pitt basketball team ﬁnally got to ‘hit
someone else for a change last Thursday
night ——- and Pitt loved it.

“It felt great. I love catching [the ball]
underneath and getting in there and taking
it at someone else,” said center Darren
Morningstar, who scored a team-high 16
points and seven rebounds in the Panthers’
92-64 exhibition victory over Australia’s
Melbourne Tigers at the Fitzgerald Field
House.

“It’s been getting edgy in practice. It’s
hard going every single day against the
same guys for three hours in practice,”
said Morningstar. “It’s much easier in
game situations. I can’t wait for our first
game.” The Panthers open the regular
season this Friday night against Northwest
Missouri State at the Field House.

Morningstar and forwards Bobby Martin
(15 points) and Jermaine Morgan (15
points) muscled their way around inside
enough to shoot 18-22 from the field,
mostly with strong inside shots and slam
dunks with Tigers draped all over them.
Melbourne center David Simmons even
had seven personal fouls called on him,
but Pitt Coach Paul Evans allowed him to
keep playing.

Anchored by that trio and forward Chris
McNeal (12 points), Pitt out-rebounded
Melbourne’ 36-22, 19-8 in the first half.

“[The Panthers] were very athletic and
very experienced,” said assistant coach
and former Seton Hall Pirate Andrew
Gaze, who was forced to sit out this tour

quite as tall as I thought they would be.
They might have some trouble with
lGeorgetown’s] Alonzo Mourning and
Dikembe Mutombo.”

The Tigers lost to Georgetown three
days before they played Pitt and were 0-
4 against Big East teams after the loss to
Pitt.

All 17 Panthers saw action against the
Tigers,‘ with 15 registering in the scoring
column.

In order to get everybody enough playing
time, Evans used a unique way of
substituting players. Every time the Tigers
scored 10 points, a new group of five
would enter the game.

One sign of Pitt’s depth this year is that
Australia didn’t even bring enough T-
shirts to give to the Panthers in the
customary gift exchange prior to the game.
“I didn’t even get one, man,” said Brian
Shorter. “They only had like 13 shirts, and
we have like 17 guys." ,

Of the seven newcomers to this year’s
Panther squad, Morgan saw the most
playing time, with 16 minutes. Ahmad
Shareef played 13 minutes, and Gandhi
Jordan and Chris McNeal each played 12.

Pitt rattled off 14 straight points early in
the first half to take a 19-7 lead, and it
never looked back from that.

After a Darelle Porter layup made the
score 30-19, the Panthers never lost their
double-digit lead, and Melbourne never
got within 20, three minutes into the
second half.

PPC sponsors Cathedral Climb

By Tammy Poole and

Jennifer Swoboda
Staﬂ“ Writers

Get on your step  Get set 
Go! A

Twenty—eight runners gathered
in the basement of the Cathedral
of Learning yesterday morning
for a competition sponsored by
the Pitt Program Council to see
which runner would have the
best time in climbing the 743
steps to the 36th ﬂoor.

Runners for the competition
were divided into seven heats,
which consisted of four runners
in each heat.

William Kanarek, a 37-year-
old vending machine owner,
came in ﬁrst in the men’s division
withatime of4 minutes, lsecond.

“I thought I would doa little
better, maybe 3:45. I’ve practiced
here before, and my best time in
practice has been 3:47, but today
I went out too fast, " said Kanarek.

Kanarek runs triathlons and
marathons and mentioned that
he will also compete in the
Cathedral Climb again next year.

“I'm 37 years old, and I beat all
these kids," said Kanarek.

Choi Choi of Pittsburgh said he
participated in the event because
after running the Columbus
Marathon, he ﬁgured he was in
pretty good shape.

“I just saw the advertisement in
the newsletter and found the
competition interesting. I ran the
Columbus Marathon last week,
so I’m in decent shape. I haven’t
been practicing up the stairs, and
I’m pretty worried,” said Choi.

Before the race, Leslie Clark,
who ﬁnished first in the women’s
division with a time of 7:26, said
she heard about the race in The
Pitt News and has run the steps
before but not in any formal race.

' Clark said the reason she
entered the race was for the fun
of it.

When Clark practiced, it took
her 6:05 to complete the climb.

“I wanted to see how I could
do in the competition, and when
I saw it in The Pitt News, I said,
‘OK, this year I'll do it.’ I didn’t do
as well as I wanted to, but I was
pleased with the timing. I would
do it again next year.”

John Lewis, sophomore, also
found out about the event in The
Pitt News.

“I just want to test myself, and
I’m a masochist, " he said. Lewis is
in the rugby club here at the
university and is also in the
wrestling club. His goal was to
finish within six to seven minutes
in the event.

After the event, Lewis said,
“I'm really happy now that I've
ﬁnished, and I do hurt a lot, so

l’ve fulfilled both initial goals.”

Eric Davis, a sophomore, said
he ran last year just because he
wanted to see if he would be able
to finish.

“I did this last year just forthe
heck of it. My dad told me that
when he was at Pitt, he walked
from the bottom to the top of the
cathedral. I just wanted to see if
I could run it,” said Davis. “This
year I did some training. I ran
three sets of 12 ﬂights. You just
have to go up and down stairs a
lot. ”

Placing third in the men’s
division was Sheldon Smoker,
who laid on the ﬂoor in a corner
after he made his successful climb.

“I ran it just once last week, and
it was as hard as I expected it to
be,” said Smoker, who had a time
of 4:22. “As soon as the event is
over, though, it’s easy. I don’t
think I could have done any
better.”

Meeting runners on the 36th
ﬂoor were volunteers from the
First Aid Safety Team of the
American Red Cross of Pittsburgh.

“This was our first year here,
and we had no problems,” said
Michael Anthony, a member of
the volunteer team.

Anthony told runners who
arrived on the 36th floor to
continue walking around and to

Women swimmers
lose to U Va Cavs

By Chris Kuzneski
Sta_[f Writer

Despite two victories by Pitt’s Laura-Lee Sullivan, the 13th-
ranked Virginia Lady Cavaliers defeated the Lady Panther (5-1)
swimming team, 181-1 19, at Trees Pool on Saturday afternoon.

Sullivan captured first place in the 100-meter and 200 breast
stroke with times of 1 minute, 7.06 seconds and 2:27.43, but it
was not enough to overcome the talented Lady Cavaliers.

“The score doesn’t indicate how close the meet really was,”
said Pitt Coach David Belowich. “This was a matchup of two
very good teams, but their overall depth was a little better than
ours. Their third- and fourth-best swimmers always seemed to
beat ours by a little.”

“They have a very tough team," said Pitt captain Theresa
Picklo, who won the 1,000 freestyle in a time of 10:13.01. “We
had a lot of good swims though, and we made them work for
the win.” ,

Virginia was paced by two All-Americans, 6-foot-2-inch
Melanie Valerio and Karen Burgess, and they accounted for ﬁve
individual wins and contributed to three relay victories.

“We just don’t have that sort of ﬂexibility,” said Belowich.

The most exciting‘ race of the day occurred in the 500
freestyle, when Valerio edged Picklo 4:57.06 to 4:57.07 to
capture nine points for Virginia (points were awarded on a 9-
4-3-2-1 basis).

“Theresa’s head was ahead of Valerio’s," said Belowich, “but

Valerio’s arms are a lot longer than Theresa’s. I think Theresa I

would've won if her ﬁngernails were longer."

Pl'lT BI'I‘S: The Pitt-Virginia women’s swim meet will be
shown Monday on KBL at 8 p.m.  Pitt’s next meet is the Pitt
Invitational, and it will be held at Trees Pool from Nov. 29 to
Dec. 1. The field will include: Harvard, St. Bonaventure,
Maryland, Bowling Green, Miami of Ohio and North Carolina
State. ‘
