The opportunity to subscribe to the Owl will end this week, accord-

campaign closes Friday.

“It is imperative that all those interested in buying, an Owl see a
salesman (identiﬁed by a yellow tag) as soon as possible, he declared‘.
Ed Klein, BA42, was the winner of the sales contest last week, selling

10 Owls, added Kreimer.

Only $1.50 is necessary to reserve a copy of the Yearbook: he re‘
minded. The remainder, $2.00, may be paid before May.

Ten full pages of undergraduate pictures, guaranteed not previously '

published in the Panther, will appear in the year book, Bill Sheris, C41,

editor of the Owl, revealed.

To conform with the theme, “YOU,” Owl writeups will contain as
many names as possible and all pictures will be natural, not posed, added

the editor.

Military Tickets
On Sale Today

Caldwell Announces
Corsages to Be Sold

The Military ball ticket commit-
tee will begin today to distribute
their tickets to those ROTC men
who have made applications and
will continue the distribution until
Wednesday, March 12.

Sam Aronson., BA41, ticket chair-
man, stressed the point that the
students must have their money
ready when the committee members
come to their respective military
science classrooms, so as to avoid
complications.

When all tickets which have been
applied for have been distributed,
the "remaining tickets will be avail-
able to the entire student body in
the military department oﬁice after
1 o’clock on Wednesday. Selling for
$3, the tickets will be sold on a
policy of “first come, first served.”

Also on ‘Monday, Richard Cald-
well, E42, chairman of decorations
for the annual military formal, an-
nounced that students may begin to
purchase tickets for corsages.

Under the arrangement, all com-
mittee members who so desire, will
sell to the student body tickets
which enable the student to buy
Corsages from a florist authorized
by the Military ball committee. The
corsage sale ends March 27.

Samples of corsages selling for
$1, $1.50, and $2 will be displayed
at the military ofﬁce.

Caldwell stressed that students
are not restricted to these sample
offers suggested and shown by the
committee, but may order any type
of ﬂower they desire.

Those committee members who
desire to sell the corsages will be
supplied with tickets at a meeting
to be held today at 12:30 o’clock in
16 Cathedral. Students are asked
to put their order in early to avoid
last minute confusion and delay, ac-
cording to Caldwell.

Guentlier Speaks
At Joint Lecture

Undergraduate students in min-
ing and metallurgical course at
Pitt, Carnegie Tech, and Penn St .te
will meet at 8 o’clock this evening
in Foster memorial, under the spon-
sorship of the Pittsburgh section of
the American Institute of Mining
and Metallurgical Engineering.

E. B. Guenther of the 1-Iarbison-
Walker Refractories company will
show motion pictures and lecture
on the manufacture of refractories.
A social hour and refreshments will
follow the talk.

E. A. Holbrook, dean of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines,
and president of the Pittsburgh sec-
tion of the American institute, is in
charge of the meeting.

Men’s Council Will Determine

Possibilities of Bridge Club

Men’s council will undertake the
organization of a bridge club at a
meeting in 132 Cathedral on Wed-
nesday at 12:30 o’clock, announces
Don Parke, C41, president.

Purpose of the meeting is to de-
termine whether those people who
are interested in playing bridge are
willing to organize themselves into
a permanent group for that purpose.

Since the bridge club of last year
vsent out of existence because no
place was available for playing, a
tentative plan will be made where-
by members of the club will be able
to use the various sorority and fra-
ternity houses on campus.

Beginners Welcome

Anyone, beginners as well as
experts, interested in playing bridge
and organizing a club for that pur-
pose are invited to attend the meet-
ing, states Parke.

A suggestion will be made at the
meeting for a series of classes in
bridge playing to teach beginners.
Also, the possibility of incorporating
bridge playing in the intramural
program will be discussed.

Interested students who will not
be able to attend the meeting should
leave their names  addresses in
the oﬁ°ice of the dean of men.

At a meeting of Men’s council
last Thursday, several proposals
were made to better the position of
the independent student in the in-
tramural sports program.

To remedy the inconvenience for
independent teams of having to go
to Trees gym to sign-up in order
to play certain sports, Men’s council
will try to arrange for the captains
of these teams to sign up on the
eighth floor of the Cathedral.

For Commuters

The council also intends to carry
through a plan whereby games be-
tween independent students will be
played in the early afternoon. This
will make it unnecessary for these
students, the majority of whom
commute on streetcars, to wait
around until late afternoon before
being able to play.

Another motion was passed to
investigate the possibility of having
student representation on the
Faculty Athletic council, which at
present is composed of seven mem-
bers of the i'aculty. The purpose of
tlii: plan, said Parke. is “to pro-
mote a better student understand-
ing of the University athletic pol-

s.‘

icy."

Class Launches

Sample Poll

Technique Produces
Increased Accuracy

A radically different type of pub-
lic opinion poll will be demonstrat-
ed to University students within
the next month by the class in pub-
lic opinion of the department of po-
litical science in cooperation with

’ the Pitt News.

Designed to ‘get a more accurate
picture of the opinion of the per-
sons interviewed, this new polling
technique has been devised by the
28 students in the class, which is

. being given for the ﬁrst. time this ,

semester. Louis ‘ W. H. Johnston,

instructor in political science, con- i

ducts the class and will be in charge
of the laboratory experiment.
Improvement of Technique

Improvement of the polling tech-
nique was decided upon by the class

after a study of the methods of the 1
opinion polls were discussed. John- V,
ston states the class felt that present '

day polls are not getting a true pic-
ture of public opinion.

“Our methods of poll-taking are
aimed at getting a complete view of
what the public thinks, not merely
an idea of what the people have to
say when presented with one or
two isolated questions,” John-
ston declares.

Ten Questions

The method decided upon by the
class for use in polling student opin-
ion on the American attitude to-
ward the war utilizes a series of
questions on the subject, ranging
from a extreme policy favoring one
side to a extreme policy favoring
the other side. From seven to ten
questions will be asked in the in-
quiry.

The problem of obtaining the
proper sample of student opinion
was the ﬁrst which confronted the

’ class in its effort to poll the stu-

Eric Center Students Ilocd
Faclaltg Request to ‘Go Easy’

Garbage-like odors in the classrooms, smoke-filled halls, and queer
noises in the libraries and corridors of the University’s Erie center, will

be kept at a minimum, according

to an article appearing in the Cliff

Dweller, oﬁicial student publication of the center.

The Student senate, headed by
Clarence Bukowski, decided they
didn’t want a “monitor system like
the kids in high school,” as pro-
posed in a plan suggested by the
faculty.

But of course this has no signiﬁ-
cance to the students here at the
university.

It all started when. William Coyle,
faculty secretary, sent a letter to
Bukowski, in which he decried
student rowdiness and untidiness.
The letter stated that “the Erie
center faculty object especially to
the condition of the halls and class-
rooms after lunch hour; to disturb-
ances in the library; to smoking in

classrooms and to noise in the
halls.”
Among their suggestions were:

establishing a monitor system, set-
ting aside a speciﬁc room for lunch
eating, and delegating lunch caters
to clean up their waste paper and
garbage.

You understand that this has
nothing to do with students here at
the University.

Bukow-ski appealed to his fellow-
students.“

He expressed the hope that stu-
dents will no longer throw cigar-
ette butts, ashes, and matches on
class room floors, and he suggested
that all could cooperate in using

- only a designated room in which to

lunch, in replacing their own pop
bottles in the case, and in stopping
the phonograph from blaring in the
lounge.

The student leader delivered his
appeal before a special assembly,
compulsory to all students, and
called expressly for the purpose of
discussing the problem.

It was unanimously agreed that
the students would cooperate in a
democratic way in adjusting the
situation.

But this little incident has no
connection with students here at
the University.

SFA Accident
Group W7orks

On Prevention

Committee Opposes
‘Seventh Columnists’

For the purpose of preventing ac-
cidents on campus and to combat
“seventh columnists,” SFA has
formed another safety committee,
announces Howard Schwartz, C41,
chairman of the new group.

Asked to deﬁne the term “sev-
enth columnist,” Schwartz said,
“they are people who betray them-
selves, their friends, and their fam-
ilies, that is to say, they are people
who cross the street against a red
light.”

Study Causes

To combat these people, to inves-
tigate swinging-door casualties and
the like, and to discover the means
of prevention, the committee went
into action last week by enlisting
the aid of Dr. H. C. Carlson, direc-
tor of Men’s Health service, and R.
C. Gorham, assistant professor of
electrical engineering.

Primarily concerned with preven-
tion of student accidents, the new
committee intends, nevertheless, to
investigate every major and minor
casualty on campus, in order to un-
derstand the causes, with the out-
look of using this knowledge to pre-
vent accidents that might occur in
the future.

The other and older safety com-
mittee of SFA has concerned itself
with the prevention of highway ac-
cidents alone, and carries on a cam-
paign. for this purpose once a year.
The new committee, by virtue of its
objective, will function the year-
round.

Safety Hygiene

“If we can prevent even one acci-
dent a year,” said Schwartz, “the
accident prevention committee will
be more than justified. But to ac-
complish this we must have the full
cooperation of the students not only
in watching out for the safety of
themselves and their fellow stu-
dents, but also in reporting situa-
tions which they consider to be un-
safe around the University.”

“By eliminating accident hazards
around the school,” continued
Schwartz,” and by showing these
“seventh columnists” just how and
in what way they are careless, we
can educate the students in a sort
of safety hygiene that they will be
able to take with them when they
leave school. In our committee, we
have three people who have taken.
courses in safety engineering.”

At present the members of the
new accident prevention committee
are James Dimel, E42; David Bar-
kan, C44; Leonard Glassner, Ed42;
and Emil DeLeo, E41.

Pi Tau Phi Sees Fit
To Change at Tradition

XVE NOTE XVITH REGRET tl1at Pi Tau Phi,
scholastic honorary in the College, will, at the
Scholars’ day assembly, award $10 to the senior
with the highest scholastic average in the College.
We note with regret, not because Pi Tau Phi is
recognizing outstanding achievement, but because
they are giving this new award instead of that
formerly given to the senior who had made the
greatest improvement i11 four years.

To be sure, it will be matheniatically simpler to
ﬁnd the highest ranking senior than to approxi-
mate the greatest improvement. Having set the
requirements, Pi Tau Phi will now be able to point
to the recipient and be certain that he (or she)
is the proper choice.

The old award had something particularly ap-
pealing in its bestowal: “ . . . to the College
senior making the greatest scholastic improvement
in his four years”; to the senior who had met edu-
cational difﬁculties and surmounted them; to the
student who had worked, it seemed, for his honors
and had no special natural aptitude.

But’ the highest ranking senior is probably one
with such special natural aptitudes. He is most
likely a member of Pi Tau Phi, which makes the
award a sort of mutual admiration project.

The list will be long VVednesday when the Uni-
versity, all too brieﬂy, honors its scholars. In
those lists, one will be missing for us, one who
worked, one whose predecessors seldom suspected
that they were to be so honored. He will be the
College senior who has made the greatest scholastic
improvement in his four years at Pitt.

Hope in Hopelessness

College editors throughout the country have
been expressing with a wistful naivcte their desire
for peace and their fears for the future. Disq_uiet-
ing as this note may seem to our elders, the hope-
less undercurrent in much college analysis of the
world situation may bear within it the germs of a
better world.

In the Stanford Daily, Dwight Hutchinson
writes: “We thought maybe it wouldn’t happen
again. VVe ﬁgured that, after the last war, when
the post-war escapists had blazed through the
jazz age and settled down into left-wing radical-
ism during the backwash of the depression, the
whole show was over.

“And now nations are cutting each other’s
throats again. America faces the all-too-grim
prospect of another ﬁght to save a cause or an
ideal. -[incl with it, the prospect of another post-
war age of what‘ F. Scott Fitzgerald called ‘tired
young men.’ ”

The Daily Tar Heel said editorially: “By vote
of 1,008 to 572 we announce our readiness to throw
our democracy, our lives, and our wealth into the
maelstrom. No particular claim to clairvoyance
is here made, but it is easy to see that the 1,008
who voted yes will say ten years after the war,
‘VVhy“.?’ Their fathers did. Those who are living,
those whose tortured bodies will. let them speak,
will say ‘Why?’ And from the graves of the dead
of 1917 and the burial holes of the more recent
dead will come an echo, ‘yes, why ‘J’ ”

Mascott in the Michigan Daily writes: “If
we are a scholastic failure this semester, however,
we believe We can attribute it (without ration-
alization) to the possibly irrational idea that study
at this time is largely inconsequential. It seems
extremely stupid to spend four years of your life
in an attempt‘ to learn how to live when you see
all around you forces, vicious forces, working for
your death, either intellectual, or physical.”

These are the kind of statements which have
been called defeatist, and destructive of morale in
a nation which must pour every ounce of energy
into a defense eﬁort. They are more surely the
sentiments of a generation which feels doomed be-
fore it begins to live, a generation which asks for
peace and security and ﬁnds only holocaust and
bloodshed.

Some would call them indications of weakening
moral ﬁber in American youth.

They could more justiﬁably be looked upon as
a longing for social stability and economic balance
which it may be America ’s destiny to build.

History may show that these members of the
rising generation, with their sluggish response to
the war drums and the battle cries, were not justi-
ﬁed in their short range view of the necessity of
war. Only time will prove the validity of their
pessimistic predictions.

But in their desires for a secure existence, their
vivid horror of war will eventually be found the
impetus for the establishment of permanent and
equitable peace.

The Female & One Book by a Man

The specious

0 By Edith Rosenblatt

While spring brings along sun-
shine, ﬂowers and othe indisputably
cheering details, it also brings the
problem of new clothes.

You really have two problems
there. Not only must you decide
what to get, you have to ﬁgure out
a way to get it. No matter how
much arguing and explaining you
do, no matter how many points
you’ve prepared on long winter
days, you can’t convince a man.

Let’s conﬁne this discussion to de-

pendents and more specifically to
coeds. First, they need more clothes
and more varied clothes than house-
wives. Second, a wife can nag her
husband but it isn’t polite to scream
at your father.

6 Last Year’s Style Won’t Do

, Men don’t understand. that last
spring’s styles with that “lady-like
look” won’t do. They won’t be-
lieve that designers are lobbying
for arrest--on grounds for treason—-
of those who don’t display the “navy
influence” this year. Men don’t
realize that last spring’s “nipped-in
look” has been shamed by the new
“long, lean, lithe line.” Besides
fathers don’t want their daughters
to look long and lean; they want
them to look well-fed.

You think you can beat that sys-
tem by using restraint in your in-
veigling. You begin, “I need a new
suit.” Father decides that this
sounds reasonable. A suit is prac-
tical. Father picks up the evening
paper, looks at the ads and sees
somebody’s Violet room special suit
at $55.55. It has that long etc., etc.,
look. Father quickly looks up, and
with a strangled expression gasps,

Who Likes People

The Donkey Inside

Ludwig Bemelmans likes people. He likes being
alive. He likes people and being alive so much that
his writing makes readers feel the same way. He sees
the things other people do and he laughs when they
are happy, and sympathizes with them when they are
not. He looks at Ludwig Bemelmans and he laughs
almost continuously. The laughter is not quite a belly
laugh; rather it is a big, good-natured chuckle that
says, “The world is good.”

His latest book, “The Donkey Inside,” is funda-
mentally the same as his earlier books. The locale is
different; it is Ecuador instead of Bavaria or New
York city or a U. S. army camp, but regardless of the
place. it it still seen through Bemelmans’ eyes. True,
they are the eyes of an older, more mature Bemelmans
than the bewildered boy in “My War With the United
States,” but maturity has not dulled the boy's keen
sense of the ridiculous.

On Trips to Ecuador

“The Donkey Inside” is a semi-fictional composite
view of several trips to Ecuador. When Bemelmans
found embellishment an aid in the account of his ad-
ventures, he embellished. The characters are almost
all fictitious, in the sense that they did not exist as
the exact individuals he pictured, but they too are
composites, composites of several similar real-life peo-
ple. The incidents may not have occurred exactly as
they appear in Bemelmans’ words, but they all have
their basis in reality. '

There is no exact parallel in modern ﬁction for
Bemelmans’ writing, chieﬂy because of the impossi-
bility of determining where he becomes a ﬁctionist and
leaves off being a factual narrator. Admittedly, the
anecdotes in “The Donkey Inside” have more than a
little element of exaggeration, but the whole effect is
altogether so satisfying that the question of ﬁction or
non-ﬁction becomes trivial. Perhaps Bemelmans
wasn’t mistaken for Warden Lawes by the superin-
tendent of an Ecuador prison. Perhaps the automobile
ride to Quito wasn’t quite so hazardous as Bemelmans
describes it. Perhaps the eccentricities of Battleship C
are overdrawn. It really doesn’t matter. The net re-
sult is highly enjoyable reading, whimsical and lively.

by Ludwig Bemelmans

The Saroyan Touch

There is much of the Saroyan touch in Bemelmans,
except that Bemelmans achieves a similar sense of de-
lighted awe and wonder without any convulutions of
writing techniques. “The Donkey Inside” will probably
not go down in the history of American literature as
a classic, but it must be considered a worthy com-
panion of “My War with the United States,” “Life
Class,” and “Small Beer” for its freshness of treatment,
its sprightliness, and its all-around good humor.--Bill

Rimsky: What interests you
most in this Cosmopolitan world?

Korsakoff: Well, I once knew a
couple of Czechs who traded their
trout st-ream near Prague for deep-
er waters when Hitler paid them a.
visit.

If you had said, I once had a few

could have said, That’s nothing,
these fellows contributed to the Pa-

I'll wave that. You ask me a

All right. If there are three peo-
Die in one room of a rather large

leaves, how many dishwashers go on
strike in the kitchen?

I’m glad you mansioned that. It’s
a striking question.

Here’s another, then. Take ﬁve
old women, give them passes to the
Casino, and all a cab. What is the
interest, as a result, on $2500 for a
period of nine and three-fourths
days?

Are they very old women? If so,
they are part of the show and can
pay their own way.

Well, since you answered that
question, try this. Suppose thirty
sailors are marooned on an island.
And on this island there live only
three girls. Now thcn—-

WSGA will investigate that.
Let’s keep hex out of this.

That’s an unknown quantity.

It’s a quantity, all right. But
on this island there are also thirty
canoes, built by the last sailor ma-
rooned there. Now then-

That’s easy. All they have to do
is form a rowing team and build up
a university around it.

Then maybe they could call it the
rowboat of learning. But also on
this island there are tWenty—seven
sails which could be used on the
canoes. Now then—

Then, then, they can take the
girls along too. Or they can make
clothes out of the sails. Nothig sa-

That’s a new wrinkle.

SAM Wins IF Basketball Cup

With 12 Consecutive Victories

Coaching Aides
Continue Drills
F or Gridsters

There's no rest for the weary in
Pitt’s football training program.
Panther gridders are learning the
whys and why not’s of the Pitt
football system now, as 1941 can-
didates for the various positions
hold regular skull drills with their
coaches. Up under gate three of
the stadium every afternoon, pros-
pective Panthers are learning why
they pulled too far to the left, why
the halfback didn’t run in the
right hole, or why the hole wasn’t
there. '

Last Monday afternoon, for ex-
ample, coach Bobby Hoel ran his
tacklesthrough an intensive mental
drillpin the ﬁne art of doing the
right thing at the right time.

Some not-too-entertaining movies
were first on the program. Burly
tackles groaned and sweated as the
all-seeing camera ground out a rec-
Over and
over the ﬁlms were run, until every
man saw why that tackle was
sucked in and why another missed
his man on that end run.

Lesson number two was a long
session of blackboard chalk dia-
grams. Last year’s regulars were

' the topic of discussion, and those
A who were on hand explained in

black and white some of their pe-
culiar movements in last year’s
games.

New tackle prospects, a two-thirds
majority of the group, were the
most interested students in Bobby
Hoel’s class, ﬁring questions at their
team—mates and learning fast.

Toughest part of the program was
coach Hoel’s quiz. Hoel keeps the
boys on their toes by questioning
them on what they would do in va-
rious hypothetical situations. When
the more rugged work of spring
training gets under way, Pitt’s foot-
ballers will be sharp enough men-
tally to step into the physical train-
ing program at top speed.

\Vith :1 spotless mark of 12 wins and no defeats, Sigma Alpha
)[u’s ﬁve iron men clethroned last year’s champions, Phi Kappa, to
gain their ﬁrst IF title in the last 10 years.

In pre-season selections, they were given nothing more than 21
dark horse chance to cop the crown. but as the season wore on

PiKA ; s ‘Ti’/allop
Fiji Basketeers

A ﬁghting PiKA ﬁve knocked a
favored Phi Gam team out of the
running in the IF basketball tourn-
ament Thursday night with a 33-23
upset.

Playing with only ﬁve men
throughout the whole battle, this
team composed of four freshman
and one sophomore kept the Phi
Gams bottled up during the game.

Whitey Carlson and “Dapper
Dick” Fair led the PiKA attack with
12 points apiece. None of the Phi
Gams could penetrate the victors’
defense, including all-intramural
Thurbon, who was held in check by
the Bellﬁeld boys.

The newly crowned champions,
the Sammies, won their last game
of the year from the Phi Eps, 25-15.

It was a close contest throughout,
and the Sammies were behind at
half—time 11-8, but coming through
as true champions should, the Sam-
mies applied the power in the last
half to emerge the victors.

Colton led the victors with eight
points, while Coplin led the Phi

I Eps with 10.

Kappa Sigma won another game
as they defeated the Delts, 32-18.
Norbut led the Kappa Sigs attack
with 12 points.

Last year’s champions, the Phi
Kaps, clinched a tie for third place
with their victory over the Theta
Chi team, 33-21.

Tyberski and Glenn led the Phi
Kap team with 12 points apiece,
while Dax of the Phi Kaps and Bet-
ler of Theta Chi followed up with
10 and nine points respectively.

Lambda Chi Alpha and Sigma Chi
forfeited to the Phi Delts and SAE
respectively.

Science Group

Will Initiate 31

Dr. E. V. McCollum of Johns
Hopkins university, recognized the
‘world over as one of the pioneers
in the science of nutrition, will speak
at the annual banquet for initiates
of Sigma Xi, honorary science so-
ciety. Wednesday evening in the
Faculty club. .

With a personal background on
the values of vitamins and nutri-
tions (he was close to death from
malnutrition on his midwest farm
home as a child), Dr. McCollum
rose to become one of the collabora-
tors in proving the existence and
importance of vitamins while a
young man on the faculty of the
University of Wisconsin.

Author of “The Newer Knowl-
edge of Nutrition,” Dr. McCollum
is past president of the American
Institute of Nutrition, past presi-
dent of the American Society of
Biological Chemists, and adviser to
the National Research council
committee on food and nutrition in
relation to the National Defense
program.

Sigma Xi has issued invitations to
33 persons to become members, but
two of these have not indicated
their decision, stated Dr. Albert E.
Staniland, assistant professor of
mathematics and secretary of the
organization.

Reservations for the banquet at
6:30 o’clock and lecture at 8 o’clock
can be made through Dr. Staniland
in 442 Cathedral.

Basketball glory came back to
Pitt this year, as Doc Carlson’s
Panther passers waded through a
thrill-packed season and emerged
with their finest record in six years.
From their ﬁrst victory of the

season, a 36-34 win over future Big
Ten champ Wisconsin, the Panthers
improved steadily to ﬁnish the cam-
paign in a blaze of scoring fury that
sank six teams in a row. ,1

O Malarkey Comes Through

Thrilling triumphs over Illinois,
Butler, and Ohio State proved that
the Wisconsin victory was no ﬂuke.
And the Illinois game proved some-

their chances grew. Critics could
not see how ﬁve comparatively
small men could win the most
sought after trophy in the frater-
nity ranks, but it was done.

Using a fast breaking offense and
a closely knit defense, the Sammies
knocked over team after team until
their crucial game with the ex-
champion Phi Kaps.

With Morris Mayer slipping
through the Phi Kap defense con-
sistently, the SAM quintet passed
their stiffest test.

Delts Smeared

Starting off in the second half of
the IF race, the diminutive cham-
pions scored a crushing 30-5 vic-
tory over the Delt team. They fol-
lowed this with a 20-13 verdict over
the fast fading Pilam combination.

A 44-18 loss was then handed to
the sweethearts from Sigma Chi as
Harry Abramovitz, Danny Colton,
and Mel Frank contributed points
to the cause.

Pi Kappa Alpha and Phi Epsilon
Pi were the last two teams to fall
before the power of the SAM squad.

“Hack” White was the most valu-
able player on the crown-bearing
squad, controlling the rebounds
from the banking boards in every
contest. His steadying force on the
team, his ball handling, and his de-
fensive work stamped him as a ﬁrst
team choice on the all-intramural
team.

Tie for Third

In second place of the IF race
was the Phi Gamma Delta aggrega-
tion. The Fijis fell early in the
season before the Sammie team,‘
then went on undefeated until they
were upset in the last game of the
season by a ﬁghting PiKA team.

Al Holbrook, Mike Mitchell, Bob
Quick, Earl Pressel, and Bobby
Thurbon were the starting combi-
nation for the Phi Gams.

Tied £3? third place were the Phi
Kaps and the Phi Delts with nine
victories and three defeats. The
Phi Kaps, with only Glenn to hold
them together, fell apart late in
the season, and appeared to be con-
tent with third place.

The Phi Delt team of Robinson
and Young made a terriﬁc come-
back in the second half of the race
after they had lost their ﬁrst three
games. Their crowning achieve-
ment was their defeat of the Phi
Kaps.

“All work and no play makes a
good lawyer,” said the teacher.

“Nuts,” said the junior class.

And so the shysters will shuffle at
their informal Barristers’ ball to be
held at Churchill Valley Country
club, Saturday evening, from 10 to
1 o’clock.

Just to make it legal, the boys
have subpoeneol Jerry Hahn and his
or-ches‘-;ra for the music, and they
promise to serve their dates with
judicial writs for souvenirs.

The dance is being sponsored by
the junior class, but according to
chairman Sam Bonavita, all mem-
bers and alumni of the School of
Law are invited to attend. Tickets
are $2.00.

Bonavita’s committee includes:
Charles Hergenroeder, Austin
George, Bill Copeland, Stan Simon,
Tully Unger, and George Berry.

thing else, that Panther sophomore
Tay Malarkey was a potentially
great basketball player. Tay step-
ped up to the foul line with the
score knotted in overtime and
calmly ﬂipped through the cords
the point that put the Panthers
ahead to stay.

First low point of the season was
a 48-28 drubbing by a gang of fugi-
tives from a football practice at
Northwestern. Don Clawson and
his fellow bruisers turned out to be
the doormats of the Big Ten, but
they were really Wildcats against
Pitt.

0 Barr Stopped

Another low point was the 41-36
defeat slapped on the Carlsonites
by Westminster’s all-conquering
Titans. Larry Paifrath kept his
comeback rolling; but the varsity
couldn’t, and Westminster’s stretch
drive furnished the ﬁnal touch to
a disappointing evening for Pitt
fans.

The Panthers were a greatly im-
proved ball club against Penn State.
They rushed State all over the
court, stopped Johnny Barr, and
carried off a convincing 36-27 vic-
tory.

Comic relief was furnished by
Carnegie Tech’s “Futility Five.”

Poor Weather
Keeps Baseball
Squad Indoors

Improved Backstops
Bolster Team Hopes

C;:1tinual unfavorable weatlier
has postponed indeﬁnitely the
plans of the baseball coaching
staif to drill the team outdoors.
Until the weather breaks, the
Pitt baseball candidates will
hold their practices on the min-
iature diamond beneath the sta-
dium.

Since the Panthers are somewhat
hampered by the conditions pre-
vailing, considerable anxiety is felt
that the team may not be in the
best condition for the opening game
with Ohio State on March 31. The
group of baseball aspirants has been
unable to engage in any extensive
drills thus far.

Although the prospects for the
1941 season are better than average,
pre-season happenings have tended
to dim the Pitt hopes. However,
these should be easily dispensed
with as soon as warm weather
makes its appearance.

Guadagnino Returns

Perhaps the only note of real en-

couragement in the entire matter

is the catching department. Here
plenty of veteran ability plus new
athletes will more than keep the
Pitt nine well supplied.

Heading the list of Panther catch-
ers will be burly Guy Guadagnino,
veteran of the 1940 campaign and
leading man for the current var-
sity spot. Close behind Guadag-
mino is sophomore Art Bariska, who
is being counted upon considerably
to lessen the burden of catching.

Newcomers to the position also
may play an important role. Foot- "
baller Joe Ret-
tinger has shown
promise of being
capable of hand-
ling t h e j o b
s h o u l d he be
called upon. Also
a potent factor is
s o p h o more Al
Icardi who, al-
t h o ugh lacking
the necessary
weight, has dis-
played plenty of
ability.

The two posi-
t i o n s w h e r e
coach Ralph Mitterling is having
trouble are the ﬁrst base and pitch-
ing departments. In the former,
Mitterling will have to bank almost
entirely upon inexperienced mate-
rial. Number one in the race for
the varsity ﬁrst base post is sopho-
more Johnny Brown, promising
newcomer, with Lefty Ziolkowski,
Andy Baker, and Ralph Fife also in
the running.

Jones Heads Pitchers

Thus far this season neither Baker
nor Fife has engaged in extensive
practice sessions. Both will proba-
bly undergo plenty of drills when
the team goes outdoors.

As for the pitching department,
Mitterling will probably have to
bank on the efforts of Edgar Jones.
The only drawback to this is that
“Special Delivery” may be hin-
dered by the fact that baseball wﬂl
conflict with spring football drills.

In spite of the fact that the
Panthers are being plagued by these
problems, the prospect for the com-
ing season is extremely bright.
With a number of veterans return-
ing from last season’s squad, the
Pitt team should repay several of
the humilating defeats suffered in
the past.

Intramural bowling records were
a dime a dozen in practically every
league contest, but to the Pilams
went the lion’s share of broken
marks.

Pilams Set Record

The Pilam team of captain Bert
Engelsburg, Hershey Mattes, Al
Gross,-Lenny Wolk, and Al David-
son broke the previous year’s ﬁve
man team mark by 3 pins. They
bowled a brilliant 823 in a close
contest with the Phi Kaps to make
this new mark.

In the same match, Engelsburg
hit the high mark of 246 to notch
another record for his team.

Bill Kramer, ace bowler of the
fourth place Delts, hit a new three
game high by knocking over an
average of 194 pins per game.
DeRocher’s Loss Hurts

Phi Kappa’s Jack Glenn, Tom
Murphy, Joe Connell, Bob Tyber-
ski, and Ray Proshnok didn’t break
any records, but they bowled good
consistent ball to earn themselves
a well deserved tie for the ﬁrst po-
sition.

Pi Kappa Alpha probably had the
hardest job cut out for them as last
year’s graduation took from them
the best bowler on the Pitt campus,
Henry “Hank” DeRocher. Hank
was the PiKAs’ “one man team”
last season, and getting an adequate

replacement seemed impossible.

Freshmen Lloyd Carlson and
Dick Fair took up the load, and the
PiKA team was on its way once
again. Veteran holdovers from last
season’s championship ﬁve were
Chuck Page, Jim Klingensmith, and
Abe Williams.

Delts Cause Trouble

Finishing just a notch out of pay
dirt, the Delta Tau Delta team gave
all top contenders many an anxious
moment. Kramer, Trimble, Cor-
nelius, Klein, and Seitam made up
the Delt squad.

Sigma Chi’s Mark Anderson, Phi
Epsilon Pi’s Al Gould, Wally Ren-
ton of the Lambda Chi Alpha house,
and Don Ferris of the Phi Delt’s
mediocre team bowled excellent
games in every match they partici-
pated in, but lack of support from
teammates made their efforts futile.

ﬂow Spain Eminp gmdm

Pitt won, 45-30, in what was billed
as a basketball game.

After bowing to Waynesburg’s
Yellow Jackets and “Diamond Jim”
Brady, the Panthers shifted into
high and proceeded to knock off
their next six foes. '
0 Kocheran Gets Hot

Duke and Army were the ﬁrst
victims. Most notable result of
these battles was the comeback of
George Kocheran, who broke out
of his scoring slump with 13 points
against the Blue Devils and pro-
ceeded to keep his new—found shoot-
ing eye for the rest of the cam-
paign.

Pitt’s best home performance was
a 59-45 drubbing of West Virginia’s
tough Mountaineers. Carls0n’s boys
rolled at top speed all the way in
a smooth exhibition of what a bas-
ketball team looks like when its
plays are working and its shots are
rolling in.

0 Seniors Click

With a win over Tech sand-
wiched in, the Panthers raced to a
couple of impressive wins over
Geneva. Ed Straloski, held score-
less by the tepid Tartans, whipped
through 20 points against a Geneva
team that was hot enough to stop
most ball clubs.

The Panthers, and especially
Straloski, were at the top of their
game in the ﬁnal home battle, cli-
max of six games that provided
Stadium fans with an overdose of
thrills. Panther seniors Mel Port,
Ed Straloski, Jim Klein, Sam Mi-
lanovich, and George Kocheran
were so good against Geneva that
even their ﬁnal dismal showing
against Penn State was anti-climax.

When the books closed for the
season, Pitt had twelve victories,
five defeats, and a smooth—working
basketball club capable of holding
its own in the best basketball com-

pany.

Hal H. Viehman
To Leave Pitt
YMCA Position

Associate Secretary
Receives Promotion

Harold Viehman, ’39, for the past
two years associate secretary of the
Young Men’s Christian association,
has been pro-
moted from the
University Y staff
to the position of
program secreta-
ry of the Alle-
gheny branch of
the YMCA of
Pittsburgh locat-
ed on the North
side.

Active as an
u n d e rgraduate,
Viehman was ed-
itor of the Owl,
member of Omi-
cron Delta Kappa, national honor
leadership society, selected for Hall
of Fame, president of the Univer-
sity YMCA, and member of Delta
Tau Delta, social fraternity. At the
1940 freshman camp, Viehman act-
ed in the capacity of camp director.

William L. Hammaker, executive
secretary of the University YMCA
stated on the departure of Viehman
that “I am glad for the opportunity
of expressing my personal tribute
to Hal Viehman with whom it has
been a real pleasure to work in the
past year. His leaving is not only
a loss to the YMCA but to the stu-
dent body and the University itself.”

Dr. S. P. Franklin, director of
courses in religious education and
chairman of the Committee of Man-
agement of the University YMCA
thus expressed his sentiment: “As
an associate secretary Hal Viehman
has been outstanding and well liked
by all, students and faculty alike.
We regret losing him but are very
happy that he is being promoted.
As yet no one has been considered
to take his place.”

Oﬁicially Viehman’s work at the
University terminates next Satur-
day.

surveys of opinion call for the de-
termination of a sample cross-sec-

At Buhl Planetariutn

University Departments Aid
In Pittsburgh Health Show

Schools of Medicine and Pharmacy, University hospitals, and Dr.
Peter Gray, associate professor of biology, play an important part in the
Pittsburgh Health show now in progress at Buhl planetarium and the
Institute of Popular Science on the North side.

The health show is being spon-
sored by the Allegheny County
Medical society, the General Health
council, and the Pittsburgh depart-
ment of public health. These mo-
bilized health organizations have
spent thousands of dollars on the
huge exhibition, bringing to Pitts-
burgh the famous “Hall of Man,”
hit show from the New York
World’s fair.

Life in the Raw

The “Hall of Man” is a series of
exhibits which show all the pro-
cesses of human life and how the
body machine operates. Such ex-
hibits as the “Talking” skeleton
which explains the marvels of hu-
man architecture; the Dickinson
models of the birth of a baby; and
the actual organs of the human
body made transparent are included
in the collection.

School of Medicine has an ex-
hibition showing the growth and
development of the Medical center.
University hospitals are represented
through Magee and Children’s with
demonstrations of the milk registry
and the iron lung.

Take-it-Apart Woman

Dr. Peter Gray, associate pro-
fessor of biology, demonstrates the
beating heart of an embryo chick,
which is ‘enlarged to show heart
action and blood corpuscles mov-
ing through the arteries and veins.
Live rats and guinea pigs are ex-
hibited to visualize the effect of
vitamin deﬁciencies.

Pharmacy students explain how
drugs are compounded from the
raw material to the ﬁnished pre-
scription, and the School of Den-
tistry has a completely equipped
dental office on exhibition with a
hygienist to demonstrate the proper
care of the teeth.

Another popular exhibit is fa-
mous “Susannah” from PCW. She
is a life-size model of a woman
which can be taken apart, piece by
piece, and explained.

During the six-week run of the
Health show, which will continue
through April 7, the planetarium
will open at 1 o’clock every after-
noon and will close at 11 o’clock.

Kiepura, Polish Tenor,
Sings in Carnegie Hall

Jan Kiepura, Polish tenor and in--
ternational opera, concert, and mo-
vie entertainer, will appear at Car-
negie Music hall tonight at 8:30
o’clock, under the sponsorship of
the Art Society of Pittsburgh.

Kiepura will sing some of the
roles that brought him high rank
in two continents. He is now en-
route east from Hollywood after
completing arrangements for a pic-
ture to be made this spring.

SF A Prepares

Amendments

Four amendments to the Stu-
dent-Faculty association constitu-
tion, dealing with changes in pur-
pose, powers, representation, and
name, are ready for ﬁnal action at
the next meeting of the assembly,
according to Dave Tucker, C41,
chairman of the constitution revi-
sion committee. Three others, in
the process of preliminary revision,
will be presented at the meeting
and then will be referred to the
committee for ﬁnal revision.

Purpose Deﬁned

First amendment which will come
up at the meeting, scheduled for
March 26, states that “the purpose
of the association shall be to co-
ordinate and to further student life,
both collective and individual, at the
University.”

The next amendment which will
be considered, Article IV, adds ad-
visory powers to the assembly’s au-
thority and gives also legislative
and judicial powers which are lim-
ited only by provision of the bylaws,
“insofar as such powers do not con-
ﬂict with authority of the faculty
and administration.”

Activities Representation

The third amendment which will
be voted on, deals with composition
of the assembly, Tucker says. It
provides that the assembly shall
consist of 30 members, 27 students,
and 3 faculty. It further provides
that 18 of the student members
shall be student representatives,
and 9 activity representatives. Ac-
tivities, however, will be consulted
before this number is made deﬁn-
ite, Tucker states.

A fourth amendment, changing
the name from Student-Faculty as-
sociation to the Associated Students
of the University of Pittsburgh, may
be considered if time permits, Tuck-
er states.

was during the World War I that
the importance of nitrates, plati-

Honorary Fraternities Demand

More Than Grades of Tappees

Scholarship is not the only re-
quirement for Scholars’ day honors.
All the participating organizations
demand more than academic
achievement from the men and
women they honor.

Recognizing scholarship in the
ﬁeld of engineering, Sigma Tau,
honorary engineering fraternity, al-
so considers practicality and socia-
bility when deciding upon tappees.

The freshman receiving the high-
est average will receive a silver
medal and the one having the sec-
ond highest rating will receive a
bronze medal.

_A senior member of Phi Alpha
Theta, honorary history fraternity,
with the highest average is award-
ed a scholarship key. Before his-
tory majors can be tapped to Phi
Alpha Theta, they must have a B in
at least 18 credits of history and a
C in all other subjects. They must
also show interest in student activ-
ities and be selected by the local
chapter.

Men and women majoring in the
ﬁelds of education are presented an
opportunity to membership in Kap-
pa Phi Kappa and Pi Lambda The-
ta, honorary education fraternities,
the former for men, the latter for
women.

Kappa Phi Kappa bases selection
on leadership in educational ﬁelds.
A student must have completed six
credits in the ﬁeld, be a “man
of good character, high scholarship,
and have a true interest in the fur-
therance of education.”

Before a woman is tapped to Pi
Lambda Theta she must have com-
pleted her practice teaching. Ini-
tiates are required to have a high
scholastic rating, good character and
the recommendation of one member

of the University faculty, two mem-
bers of Pi Lambda Theta, and a su-
pervisor of their practice teaching.

An honorary chemistry frater-
nity to which chemistry specials,
chemical engineers, and all men in-
dicating ability in chemistry may
be tapped, providing they have a
2.2 average, is Phi Lambda Upsilon.

Distinctive among the honora-
ries is Beta Gamma Sigma, busi-
ness administration fraternity. Ac-
cording to national rule, the maxi-
mum limits for tapping are ten per
cent of the senior class and two per
cent of the junior class. Outstand-
ing work in business administration
together with a 2. average are neces-
sary.

Ceramics Groups
Meet at University

The Art division and the Pitts-
burgh section of the American Cer-
amic society will hold a joint meet-
ing tomorrow at Mellon institute

tion of science and art is the theme

A tour of the Nationality rooms
and the ceramics exhibit on the
thirtieth ﬂoor of the Cathedral will
feature the afternoon activities.

The Annual Art dinner will be
held at 6:30 o’clock at Webster hall,
with Ross C. Purdy, secretary of
the national society, acting as toast-
master. The speaker will be the
society’s president, J. L. Carruthers.

J. Palin Thorley, professor of
ceramics, will preside over the eve-
ning program in Mellon institute
auditorium. Talks will be given by
the Rev. J. L. Kelso, Frazier Smith,
Marvin G. Yutzey, and H. Edward
Winters.
