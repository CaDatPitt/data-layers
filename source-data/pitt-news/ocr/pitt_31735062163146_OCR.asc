Educators Review Trimester System

By NATHAN FIRESTONE

Educators from over 50 dif-
ferent universities participat-
ed in a trimester conference
last Wednesday sponsored by
the University. At the confer-
ence, Chancellor Litchfield re-

vealed that over 100 colleges from
all over the nation have expressed
interest in the University’s trimes-
ter program.

Dr. Litchﬁeld told the educators
that he felt the trimester system

‘should not be restricted, to ’the

University, but that he hoped
other universities would adopt it
also. - -  ~

The chancellor said that the re-
sults for the ﬁrst year were quite
preliminary, but they had come
ollt"amazingly well.” “Forty—nine
per cent of eligible students par-
tic;i_pated, and the trimester system
broke even ﬁnanicially. The fac-
ulty seemed pleased as a whole.”

Shortcomings Listed

However, the chancellor also
listed some shortcomings of the
trimester system. As an example,
he pointed out difficulties with
various licensing agencies that
some of the schools found, and
also "mentioned eligibility prob-
lems over which the NCAA has
jurisdiction. _

Donald R. Van Houten is the-
new director of men's _housing, 
and N. Ronald Pease is serving_''1

“Holland Hall. in the Schenley
Quadrangle, will be opened this,

said Van Houten. “The renovation “
that was begun in March will be
completed in August. Holland
Hall will have a library on each
floor, and recreation and utility
areas on the top floor.” 4
_ Van Houten pointed out that
the building has been redesign-
ed as a large residence hall. but
that some of the small, unique _
and interesting features ol’_.the
original apartments have been
retained. ‘ i
As fraternity adviser, Pease is,
working to strengthen the con-
nection betwcen education and
fraternity life.’ I
' Fraternities Studied _
“In order for his experienc__e ‘to
be valuable,” said Pease, ,“the
man must be an active member of
a strong fraternity, and in a co-
operative fraternity system. " ,
“We are investigating pro-.
grams which can strengthenzthel
fraternities and instill a _;more
responsible and mature attitude,
which would result in a~ﬁne_r
spirit of competition and co-op-
eration,” Pease said. ,
According to Pease, “The in-.
crease in resident students, and
the variety of interests and abili-
tics represented by each new
freshman class, should make it
possible for fraternities to attract
more men who can attain high
academic standing and contribute
to the total morale and welfare Of

.i Prof. Edwin L Peterson

About ‘three hundred years ago a man named
Izaak Walton was wandering along. one of his
favorite chalk streams.

that morning in about 1650, much like a good
morning in 1960. The sky was blue, the-cowslips-

were ﬂowering, and the birds
were singing —— alperfect day for
angling, loaﬁng, and contempla-
tion. Izaak was doing all of _
these.

With him was a young man ’

 

of angling. Inpthe middle of the
morning, as they sat under a
hawthorn tree, Venatbr turned to .
Izaak and said, in effect, “What is" this art of
angling? What do you do? What is it "all about?”
. Izaak looked at him and then said something
that all great ﬁshermen and all great students will
understand. “We sit on cowslip banks,j7f said old
Izaak, “hear the birds sing, and possess ourselves
in quietness.” '

Today, in an electronic world, the words sound
lonely and far off, like the words of a half re-
membered dream. Yet they were real words that
told not of a dream/but of an accomplishment, a
state of mind vthathad been achieved‘ and held.

In these later years, both students and teachers

'ﬁnd it diﬁicult to possess "themselves in quietness.

The corridors hum with echoes of last night’s
television shows.‘ The Tuck Shop rattles with
knives and forks and cliches. In the classrooms
voices buzz"Iike~ summer bees interrupted by blue-
jays. Outside the city limits, the cowslip banks

‘have been ravaged by nature lovers, the birds are

dying from the indiscriminate use of ‘insecticides,
and the streams run brown with _silt and sulphuric
acid.

An Innermost Silence ,

We long for green pastures‘ and still waters.
We long to possess ourselves T in quietness, to feel
again the.-silence that lies at the core. of all things,
the silence that is touched with a music we. dimly

remember‘ but can not quite identfiy.

We who live in what is called the university
“family” are, in fact, a lonely group, lost somehow

in a noisy world of our own making, a world of

shuﬁiing feet, rasping books, and much talk. But
through them all, we sense that there is something

important we want to get hold of and can not,

some quietness, some self-possession, that will join
us with the earth, with our brother men, and with
ourselves. ‘ I '

And so, sometimes, we take the easy path from

it frustrationnto cynicism. We join the. loud speakers
and complain: “A college degree is just a ticket of '

admission. Art is in the hands of pedants. Pure
science is a political prisoner. Even love lies
dying on the’ couch of the psychiatrist.”

It was a good morning,.

  

. apart.

 

B_y so defaulting to life, however, we have won ‘
neither victory nor honorable surrender. The peace T ,1,
we long for -- the identity, the quietness, the -
music, the greenness — never did live out there
in the world, in the hills and skies of the past or
in the parallelograms’ and free forms of the pres- "
ent. It lived within the individual, where it has .
always lived. “Music, said Walt Whitman, _‘fis that.
which arises in me when I am reminded by the in- _
struments.” It does not lie out there in a new cur-  .
riculum or in another university. It lies within us.

For a Fleeting Moment

Unfortunately, though, we are not alone enough ..
to hear this musical silence, to touch it, to make it ‘
our own. Once in a while, in the classroom, the E
teacher says something that strikes a chord within,‘ .-
the student. The student would like to listen, to I A
that chord, to‘ experiment with it, to enla_rge it 7
into other. chords, and to make them part of him- "
self. To d9, so heneeds time to possess himself in,-
quietness. ‘He needs the next hour for reﬂection,m-
for looking -into himself, for circling round the‘ «
c/enter of his" being. . ~ » '

Instead, he shuffles off into the corridor and
goes to his next class or to th_eOTuck Shop. And,
the» teacher, who would also like to learnmore
from the chord he has accidentally struck, goes to A
his next class. The hour needed for self—possessionp
has been momentarily lost. 1 Ii‘or both teacher and A
student it was the most critical hour of the day,-_
and it is gone. But somehow it must be found.
again, in the _evening, perhaps, or the next day ‘or,
the next week. The good man ﬁnds a way to -re-‘=10
‘claim the hour for reﬂection. p H  .-

It would be better for the student, I think, if
he would cut his next class, avoid hiscoca-cola
friends, and take a walk for an hour with no com-.'-l ‘ ‘
panion except his idea. He would ‘walk with the
idea until he got to know it and to possess it. 
would walk with it until it became part /of him and
he of it. When the hour was over, he ‘would be‘ a '.
better person. His grades might “suffer for the 
cutting of "the next class, but he would be a more .
richly educated student, an achievement more
signiﬁcantthan making the honor-roll or- Phi Beta. =7

A Private Place

At the University of Nowhere there is a course I
called Quietness I and Quietness 2. To complete it,, 
the student enters a dim cubicle and stays there
alone for one hour on Mondays, Wednesdays, and‘? ,
Fridays. He is not allowed to take a book with 
him, for it is felt that even books sometimes int‘e_r.-7,.
fere with a profound education. The cubicle is not . P
so ‘good a classroom as a place where cowslips i‘
bloom ‘and birds sing, but the Dean of Instruction, -
Dr. Lao Tzu, believes that in spite of the ina_de- . ,
quate facilities, Quietness I and Quietness 2 are the’, i, '
most valuable courses _on the campus. , ,

Though it is.n0t listed in the bulletins,‘ the
University of Pittsburgh has a similar course, with-

Editor, Pitt News:

Spring is surely here. Right
now I’m sitting under a shade
tree on the university lawn, (at
an angle greater than 45 degrees)
the Cathedral towering at my
back. The sun, I find, is hot; but
the grass is cool. All about me,

modern mechanized life ragesi

on; yet, here, on the soft, cool,
grassy hill, a slight breeze and
calmness pervades.

Despite the formality and un-
welcomeness of the newly cut
hedges surrounding the whole
lawn area and telling us grass
walkers that we must keep away,
the whole place here. is peace-
ful, and real, and growing.

The cover of soft greenness

and healthy. The trees above and
around me too are healthy and
striving in fullness. And invisible
birds are hopping and chirping
all about over-head. «

E Of Poor Relations
I .With Asian Lands

V The need for the re-exam-
lvination of American foreign
, policy with regard to the un-
{ fderdeveloped countries of
*Asia was stressed by Eugene
<3-Sirnon,_ journalist, at last
‘sﬁ week’s Midday Series Program.
‘;‘Why can’t we have this too?”
- is a question he often heard dur-
ing his travels through the Middle
East and Asia. “Many of the peo-
ple in these poverty stricken coun-
tries are not sure just what,Com-
- munism .and Democracy are,” Si-
- ~g_1on said. .

. “They do know, however, that
people ‘under both these types of
government -have the material

-._stricken_ people are- determined to
 these things, but they are not
. -too concerned with how,” he con-
_tinued. ' ‘
Simon mentioned s e v e r a I
criticisms of our foreign policy
' ' throughout the world. »Accord-
ing to him _we have a negative
, foreign policy. We make it clear
what we are against but not
what we are for.
7 He also believes we have placed‘
an “out-dated emphasis on the
_ ‘military aspects,” and suggests
‘%7*that we should pay more attention
to building up the economy in
these poverty stricken areas.
— w“We should realize,” said Simon,
“that we are being judged by our
actions. ’ Instances such as‘ those
- that have occurred in Little Rock
' ‘add to the negative impression
 many‘of these countries have of
T, us. These instances have a more
,_ far reaching effect than the ideals
f We verbalize.”‘ ' ‘
 He followed his lecture with a

ing his tours of the Middle East
and Asia. .

If the automobile horns on Bigelow Blvdxrecently have
begun to sound like trumpets and tubas, and the streetcar
bells like piccolos, it’s not merely imagination.
' The sounds drifting across Bigelow Blvd. are trumpets,

tubas, and piccolos, and they

are being made by the mem-

bers of the American VVin’d Symphony living here for their

concert season.

All of the musicians in the
Wind Symphony", are college stu-
dents who have been recruited
from schools throughout the U. S.
and Canada by auditions with con-

Stephen' Levine, trumpeteer
from Juilliard ‘School of Music, is»
impressed by the unique character

“The barge only travels ‘twen-
ty miles an hour,” explains Lou-
isiana State ﬂutist Margaret Mor-
gan, “so they start it out early.
We take a bus and meet it at
the site- of the concert. Last
year for one concert the per-

barge did and they had to wait
for it.” ‘

The dean listed some common
objections to ‘the trimester

‘complaints. He said that some

work, rest, or read.

In answer—to the first complaint,
that of needing more time to work,
Dean Crawford explained that
student aid was stepped up to
meet the needs of_those students
who would ordinarily find it nec-

tion in two ways: first, students
finishing earlier would be more
inclined to go to graduate school,
and secondly, that age was not
always a decisive factor in emo-
tional maturity. . _
Dr; Crawford commented on
the difficulties of not having a
ﬁnal exam period, and said it
appeared that a slight majority
of the faculty would be in favor
of one. _.

He cited some positive aspects
of the trimester plan to_ the in-
terested educators: an additional
opportunity for faculty who
needed more income, andlmore
favorable time for travel, research,
and study for those who do not
choose to‘ go three trimesters.

Of a number of educators polled
after the conference, all indicated
that the conference had shed a
good deal of light on the trimes-

good deal of new and valuable in-
