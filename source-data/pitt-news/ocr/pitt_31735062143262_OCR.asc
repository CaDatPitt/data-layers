Council Gets
Mines Apology

Sanctions May 12 as Date
for Spring Dance

An official apology has been pre-
pared and submitted to Student Rela-
tions committee of Student Council
by the social committee of the School
of Mines for-unintentionally issuing
advance publicity on the spring
Mines dance. A recent story in the
News stating that the aﬁair will take
place Friday, May 12, was given out
before the Miners had been granted
that particular date by the Relations
group. The Mines committee has
made known to Relations committee
that its error has been’ sincerely re-
gretted.

However, the Council committee
has forgiven‘*the'“oversight and - has
proceeded to san-ction the date for the
Mines School affair. This dance will
take place at the Pines on Perrysville
road with tickets selling for $2.00 per
couple. A midnight supper is includ-
ed in the assessment. Al Fazio, Met.
’33, chairman of the dance, announces
that students in the Engineering
School may attend, but that a pre-
vious notice proclaiming the dance
open to all students in the University
has been retracted by the Mines com-
mittee.

Fazio’s committee includes: Dave
Llewelyn, Met. ’33; Dave Sawyer, P.
R. ’33; Harry Hess, Oil ’33, and Her-
bert Fine, Mines ’34.

The committee composed of Robert
G. Grove, '14; W. C. Arthur, '17, and
Norman MacLeod, '17, in recommend-

Howard Carson Kidd would have
been proud.”

Montfort Jones, professor of ﬁ-
nance; Dr. George K. McCabe, assist-
ant professor of economics, and Wil-
bert C. Fritz, instructor in ﬁnancial
research, discussed the recent bank-
ing crises and bank rehabilitation at
the meeting which was attended by
158 members and guests.

A plea for old text books has been
made to Pitt students by the YWCA
schools for unemployed. They are
asking students to lend books for use
in these classes.

College iAss’n

   

Dances Friday

 

Sell Most of 300 Tickets in
Advance

Bill Leroy’s Town Tattlers will open
the informal dance of the College As-
sociation with a medley of popular mel-
odies at 9 o'clock Friday night in the
ballroom of the Hotel Schenley. This
affair is the ﬁrst on -the association's
semester schedule of two dances.

An advance sale has disposed of
most of the limited number of 300
tickets, and has led Bob Jarvis, ’33,
president of the association, to expect
a, full house.

This is the affair which has been.

voted the record for having its date
changed most often. The present and
ﬁnal date is the one previously set for
the Military Ball.

Present negotiations on the part of
Jarvis and his committee may result
in the booking of the Johnson Sisters
of radio prominence to augment the
orchestra by singing the vocal chor-
uses of many popular numbers.

The Town Tattlers played the ﬁrst
semester informal of the association
and many tea and fraternity dances.

The formal da.nce, set for May 12,
instead of April 12 as announced Fri-
day, will take place in the Grotto
Ballroom on the North Side". No or-
chestra has been selected as yet.
Ticket abuses, which have been fre-
quent in regard to association formals
in the last few years, will be com-
pletely done away with, according to
Jarvis-, and he warns bargain hunting
socialites that it will be impossible
to purchase the tickets of other mem-
bers for one dance at reduced rates.
Tickets to either of the two affairs are
the same price as membership for
both.

Membership tickets to the a.ssocia-
tion are available to all students of
the University at $2.00 p'er couple.
They may be purchased Thursday and
Friday at -a special booth in Alumni
Hall and in the office of the dean of
,Th0Y are also on sale at pres-
ent from Jarvis, and the other offi-
cers of the association: Ben Weiss-
man, ’33, vice‘ president; Joseph No-
vak, '35, secretary; Jack Hunger, ’34,

members of the association social
committee: Lois Boggs, ’33; Barbara
Hartman, ’33; Harry Borus, ’33; Leroy
Lewis, '3; William Theis, ’33; Thomas
Cummings, ’33, publicity chairman;

At a meeting last Wednesday,
March 22, of the executive ofﬁcers,
the executive committee and a group
of students from the student body of
the Downtown Division, two primary
revisions were made in the by-laws of
the Downtown Student Association

First, it was decided to do away
with fraternity representation and to
have an executive committee of ﬁve
members instead—three to be appoint-
ed by the incoming president and two
to be elected by the students. Then
a new nominating committee was ap
pointed consisting of the retiring
president, Charles Walker; the ad-
viser, Dr. Vincent Lanfear; the secre-
tary, James Davalt, and the two stu-
dents picked by the president now in
office, preferably from among the
graduate students. The entire list
will be completed by Monday, April 3,
at which time additional nominations
will be received by the student body
at large.

Final elections will take place dur-

.whom-._are. members. of Pi Tau Phi,

Omega Delta
Leads Greek
Scholarship
Maintains_—_1-i-5-0. Standard

Over First Semester;
Pi Lambda Second

 

All-Average Is 1.217

 

Omega Delta, local social fraternity,
and Pi Lambda Phi, national social
fraternity, stand in favorable positions
to take the scholarship plaque award-
ed annually by Interfraternity Council,
according to ﬁgures released by the
office of J. G. Quick, University Reg-
istrar. Omega Delta has maintained
a 1.50 quality point average for the
ﬁrst semester to lead the 15 social
fraternities on campus which are
members of Council, while Pi Lambda
Phi follows very closely with a quality
point average of 1.48.‘ Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, also a national social, has
third place with a 1.41 standing.

The all-fraiternity average for the
last semester was 1.217, which was
bettered by seven council-represented
fraternities, and by Omega Psi Phi
which led the entire ﬁeld with a_ 2.02
average. Omega Psi Phi, however, is"
ineligible for the plaque since it does
not maintain a chapter house and.
hence, is not affiliated with council.
Eleven house-maintaining organiza-
tions fell below the “all” average, as
did Alpha Phi Alpha, which does not
support a chapter home. _

The scholarship plaque will be
awarded at the end, of the present
semester to the fraternity which has
the highest composite average for the
year. It has been in existence for
only two years and will remain in the
permanent possession of the frater-
nity which wins it three times. Phi
Epsilon Pi, which took it last year, at
present stands sixth in line with a.
1.25 average, while Theta Chi, which
won it the ﬁrst year, is fourteenth
with an 1.02 average.

The Interfraternity plaque succeed-
ed the Dean Fetterman scholarship
cup which was ﬁrst put up for compe-
tition in 1919 and which was ﬁnally
merited permanently in 1929 , by
Omega Delta for winning it three
times.

The all-men's average has not as
yet been compiled, but last year for
the ﬁrsttime in a seven-year period,
the all-fraternity average exceeded it.

According to Mr. Theodore W. Bid-
dle, assistant to the dean of men, the
situation this time is usual with ﬁrst
semester averages in that they are
slightly below those of a full year
period. The all-fraternity average for
1931-32 was 1.275, which was .057
higher than that of the preceding
semester of this year. Omega Delta's
average for the ﬁrst part of this year,
nevertheless, is .002 above its one for
the la.st seven years of 1.498, the
average which placed it above all
other campus social groups for that
period. _

Only two fraternities this last
semester failed to achieve a “C" aver-
age: Alpha Phi Alp-ha, not a member
of Council, with an .88 average; and
Alpha Phi Delta, with an .85 standing.

Among the three professional fra-
ternities in the School of Business Ad-
ministration, Alpha Kappa Psi leads
with a 1.66’ average, followed in order
by Delta Sigma Pi, with 1.32 standing.
and by Kappa Alpha Phi, with a rat-
ing of .93. The mean average of this
group was 1.452.,

“Minick” Cast
In Rehearsal

 

Players Prepare for First
Performance on April 6

 

The cast for the Pitt Players’ spring
show, “Minick” is already in its last
week of rehearsal for the ﬁrst per-
formance at the Irene Kaufmann Set-
tlement auditorium on this coming‘
Sunday night. The campus’perforIn-
ance will be given on Thursday even-
ing, April 6, at the YW and YMHA
auditorium on Belleﬁeld avenue. ’

Forrest Alter, Col. ’36, was chosen
upon his return from the Glee Club
trip to play the part of Mr. Price, an
old cronie of "Old Man Minick.”
Samuel Moyer, Col. 'il3, has been se-
lected as assistant director for the
show. Moyer is constructing a model
stage-set which will be used as a guide
in building and furnishing the actual
set. Clara Ertman, Col. ’35, will be in
charge of the properties.

“Minick”'is the story of an old man
who cannot believe that his seventy-
two years makes him old. The play
is taken from Edna Ferber’s novel
“Old Man Minick” and was written by
Miss Ferber in collaboration with
George S. Kaufmann. Mr. Kaufmann
is a former Pittsburgh boy, He has
a large share in the authorship of
“Of Thee I Sing,” and “Dinner At
Eight” one of the most popular
straight plays on Broadway at the
present time.

Mr. Cass, director, announced yes-
terday that members of his play pro-
duction class were preparing for a
third series of one—act plays which will
be held a.t the Falk Elementary School
at an early date, possibly before
Easter.

Engineers Plan
- Pre-Orientation

Correspond With Prospec-
tive Freshmen

 

Conscious of the fact that many stu-
dents who graduate from the high
schools of Pittsburgh and vicinity with
the intention of pursuing an engineer-
ing course at Pitt know little of the
nature of such courses or the qualities
necessary for -success in them, the
Engineering Alumni Association has
evolved a plan whereby these stu-
dents will receive some orientation
before they enter the University.

A. Weldin, and D. J. Richards, two
members of the «engineering alumni
who have been particularly active in
developing this idea, have had letters
sent to -some two hundred members of
the association, informing them of this
plan and asking for their coopera-
tion.

The purpose oil this idea, which has
been followed with much success at
some of the country’s largest engi-
neering schools-, is to acquaint the
prospective engineering student,
through his high school, with the name
and address of some practicing engi-
neer living in his vicinity. If the
student then has any questions per-
taining to an engineering course
which he would like to have answered,
he is invited to call and “talk it over”
with one who is well ﬁtted to clear
up these doubts.

By this plan, it is hoped to mitigate
the evils of students enrolling for
courses about which they know little
or nothing, for which they have no
natural aptitude, and to encourage
the student entering the University
to choose his vocational course with
more care and understanding.

Rank Summer
Session Ninth

Offer Campus, Downtown
Branch Courses Again

Including graduate as well as un-
dergraduate courses, the twenty-sixth

University Summer Sessions are to

extend over a period of twelve weeks.
Campus, branch, and downtown ses-
sions are to be offered.

On the campus there will be three
intensive sessions of two weeks’
courses, regular sessions of six weeks,
eight weeks science courses, and ten
weeks session for engineering stu-
dents. A year's work in botany, chem-
istry, geology, mathematics, modern
languages, physics, and zoology can
be met in six or eight weeks of inten-
sive work, as well as basic courses in
engineering and business.

Branch sessions will be maintained
at the Johnstown, Erie, and..Union-
town Centers. Students interested in
biological sciences will have facilities
for introductory and research courses

at the Lake Laboratory on Presque
Isle, near Erie; at the nature study
camp at Na-Wak-Wa Lodge in the
mountains, near Ligonier; and at the

'Marine Biological Station at Woods

Hole, Massachusetts, The engineer-
ing surveying courses will again be
olfered at Camp Hamilton, near Wind-
ber. Downtown evening courses will
be held in the Chamber of Commerce
Building for six weeks.

Students in the College can attend
summer school to enroll in profes-
sional education courses required for
certiﬁcation since the University
maintains an elementary demonstra-
tion school and provides opportuni-
ties for practice teaching.

The Pitt Summer Session has for
several years ranked ninth among the
larger summer sessions of the coun-
try, with a majority of its major pro-
fessors and department heads in resi-
dence to direct thesis work for gradu-
ate students.

day, April 7, drill will take place
on Ruskin Field.

During the winter months, the
basic course group has attend-
ed lectures on subjects pertain-

The trick lay in the way an assistant prepared the
cannon for the performance. He used the regulation
amount of powder and vvadding, but placed the

greater part of the charge of powder a/wad of the
shot. The cannon ball was propelled only by the
small charge be/zind it which was just suflicient to
lob the 9 lb. ball over to the strong man. :

Inquiry Hears
Bellamy Talk

Writer of Utopian Story
Discussed Tomorrow

 

“Rereading Bellamy,” an investiga-
tion into American social develop‘-
ments during the past half-century,
will be the subject of tomorrow’s In-
quiry Forum meeting, when Dr. J.
Elliot Ross will be the speaker.

Bellamy, whose birthday was cele-
brated on Sunday, was the author in-
the late 1880's of a social treatise,-
“Looking Backward,” which has re-
cently been republished. His work-
has also been called the ﬁrst state-
ment of technocracy. It deals with-
America as seen from 2000 A, D.

Dr. Ross, who will review Bel1amy’s-
conceptions of social problems, is a-
lecturer, author, and priest. He is-
connected with the Newman Founda-
tion, and has taught at the University’
of Illinois, the University of Texas,
Columbia University. and the Univer-
sity of Iowa. , He has written severalr?
books on economics. ' '

In succeeding weeks, the Inquiry
Forum will feature the German situa-
tion. The viewpoint of Hitler will be
expressed next Wednesday, and at the’
following meeting, the Communist in-‘
terpretation of German events will be‘
outlined. Harold W. Cohen, “Post-‘
Gazette” movie critic, will address the
group on April 19 on the modern mo-
tion picture.

Religion versus atheism will be dis-
cussed at two Inquiry meetings in
late April and early May. The final’-
session tentatively scheduled will fea-
ture Dr. E_ R. VVeidlein, director of
the Mellon Institute, in a review of‘
Mellon Institute activities.

Qt WAA Swim

Ruling Permits Swimmers to
Better Records

   

 

Competing against Bryn Mawr, Car.
negie Tech, West Virginia, Syracuse,
|S~'warthmore, and Temple in the Pitt-
sponsored Eastern Inter-telegraphic
Swim Meet, the WAA swimming or-
ganization ran off the ﬁrst half of the
meet on Friday in the Trees Pool.

Since one of the main rules of the
Swim Meet has been to run off the
race in one hour’s time sometime in
the month of -March, WAA has divided
the competition into two one-half hour
periods. This enables many of the
swimmers to better their ﬁrst times
in the four races, the 40-yard trawl,
the 40-yard back, the 40-yard breast,
and the 100—yard free style, in the sec-
ond swim, which will take place next
Friday at 12:30 o’clock.

Those who are participating in the
swim meet have been practicing regu-
larly and rigorously for the past month
in the WAA swimming organization:
The leaders in the 40-yard crawl are
Jane McNamara, Ed. ’34; Isabelle
Murphy, Ed. 34; Florence Goga, Ed.
'33; Martha McCune, Ed, ’35; Ernes-
tine Daugherty, Ed. ’34, and Dorothy
Lee, Ed. ’33.

Competing in the 40-yard breast
stroke are Jane Edgar, Ed, ’34; Mary
Lou Mc-Connell, Ed. '34; Isabelle Mur.
Phi’. Ed. ’34, and Evelyn King, Ed. ’33;
Florence Gaga, Ed. ’33; Mary Lou
‘McConnell, Ed. ’33; Frances Dent, Ed,
'35; Martha McCune, Ed. '35; Mary
Madden, Col. ’34; will participate in
the 40-yard back. So far Jane McNa-
{I1aI‘3«, Ed. '34, is the only competitor
in the 100-free style. Many of the
contestants are capable in all four
of the events, but a, regulation of the
Eastern Inter-telegraphic Swim Meet
is that one woman may take part in
two races only.

WSGA Group Opens Drive
For Graduate Study Work

 

 

The Scholastic Honors Committee
of WSGA has placed a folder on the
hostess table in Heinz House, in which
students interested in graduate work
may sign their names and make ap-
pointments for conferences.

In the effort to interest underclass-
men in graduate study, the commit-
tee, under the chairmanship of Jean
Teats, Col. '33, will also sponsor a
series of conferences on graduate-
work between the students and fac-
ulty members. A representative from
each department of the University will
have conferences with individual stu-
dents who are interested.

Members of the Scholastic Honors
Committee are Jean Teats, Col. '33,
chairman, Alice Roth, Col, ’35, Helen
Tritinger, Ed. ’34, Janet Slease, Col.

Pick 20 Girls

Stadium':Green, May 2

Already twenty women have passed
the preliminary tryouts for the WAA
Mayfete to take place the evening of
May 2 on the Stadium green, and
many more are working on creative

dances and ideas for the Mayfete,
WAA’s contribution to the Spring
Festival.

Under the direction of Mrs. Frances
R. Tracy, of the physical education
department, all the participants are
concentrating on original dance
themes and are practicing three aft-

ernoons a week. The practices take
place in the Oil and Gas building on
Tuesdays from 2 to 3 o'clock and from
4 to 5 o’clock, on Thursdays from 3
to 4 o’clock, and on Fridays from 3 to
4. o’clock,

Unusual effects for the Mayfete
will be brought about by music, by
movements, and by lighting. Since
the dance drama has been established
as an educational project to interest
women on campus in the various
types of the dance, each year a dif-
ferent motif has been used. Because
folk and natural dancing were por-
trayed last year in the Irene Kauf-
mann Settlement, interpretation will
be the feature this year.

The program itself will comprise
dances characterized by strong move-
ments as well as frieze work and ex-
pressionistic gymnastics. The women
who have been selected to take part
in WAA’s newest tradition are: Ruth

Anderson, Ed.,; Jane Robertson, Ed.;

Schriclser Will Make
Bid For AMA Rog
Championship

Jack Schricker, who recently re-

tained his 155-pound crown in the
Eastern Intercollegiate Confer-
ence will have plenty of opposi-
tion in his bid for the middle-
weight title in the Annual Alle-
gheny Mountain Association,
H AAU senior boxing cham_p_i_onshi_ps.

This tournament, at the Key-
stone Athletic Club, Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday, draws an-
nually, the cream of the district's
amateurs. Present applications
indicate that a ﬁeld of approxi-
mately 100 will compete in the
various classes.

The middleweight, or 160-pound
class, in which Schricker has en-
tered, will undoubtedly be the
class of the entire tourney, as
there are plenty of good amateurs
of that weight around the diﬁerent
ﬁght clubs.

Schricker is the only Panther
boxer entered in this tournament
as yet, although there is more
than a faint possibility that Jimmy
Giannatti will seek the 135—pound
title,

splashers, opened the evening’s fun,
insofar as Pitt was concerned, by win-
ning the senior 50-yard free style event,
With Gessinger, Pitt, winning second
place, and Denny, Pitt, third, the race
was a clean sweep for the Corr speed-
ers. ' .

The crack Pittrelay team of Rouhe,
Mosena, Jones, an.d Schmeiler, won
the 440-yard medley relay race in the
fast time of four minutes and four sec-
onds. Jones, placing third in the
junior AMA 22-yard free style event,
was the other winner for the Panthers.

In case anyone is really interested,
he, or she, can see the records of Pitt
football teams for quite a few years
.back‘by simply going into the Var-
sity dressing room-at the Stadium and
looking at the painted boards that tell
the whole story of the entire season.

That is, the whole story, but
what went on at the Rose Bowl
on the three occasions that the
Panthers were entertained there.
All other scores are printed.
The recent cold spell, and accom-
panying snow was good news for the
football squad. The practice ﬁeld be-
ingtoo':muddy‘to do any workmn, the
squad was entertained with pictures
of the various games played last sea-
son. (Tea was served later).

It’s out now. Champ “Modest"
Tiernan once lost a wrestling
match.. The big boy admits he
lost a bout, his ﬁrst.

Now that a member of the Pitt box-
ing team has gone in for an amateur
tourney, the wrestlers are thinking of
doing the same. And it’s been said
that Coach Hubler, of the wrestling
team, will seek high honors in the
135-pound division.

With. Bi|ly..Jacobs missing, from.

the roll call this year, the tennis
team would seem to be in a pretty
bad ﬁx. However, Nate Ganger
and Billy O’LaughIin, two of last
year's consistent winners are
back, and with a bunch (as in
radishes) of good sophs, every-
thing may be all right.
It won’t be long now until the track
team will start practicing out-of-doors,
Which means that a broken down
sports reporter will have to get on
friendly terms with the Pitt Publicity
boys to see about a few mats and
maybe-some-‘tick-ets for “my cousin
who just "came"to Pittsburgh.”

About this time each year, the .
athletic department furnishes the a
basketball team, and the boxers, .
etc., a gratis meal and captains
for the coming season are named.
Which merely reminds that a foot-
ball, basketball, boxing, and
wrestling captain will be named ,
in the near future. (Downtown ,
papers please copy).

Boxers are supposed to wind up
with cauliﬂower ears, and anything
else, according to those who claim to
know. This story will dispel that
illusion. It seems that a Pitt wrest-
ler has gotten cauliﬂower EARS, or so
he claims. .-

And if boxers are called, '
“Punch-Drunk,” why not call bas- ‘
ketball players, “Floor-BUr‘|1t$” 0|‘
wrestlers, “Squeeze-Cr-azy;” or ,
football players, “Cleat-Cracked.”
(We’re off). - '
Maybe the Cap and Gown could en-

list some of the football boys in the
coming show.. You know, “color,”
and Showmanship.

I The Parking Problem

 HE yellow traiﬁc marker "holds no terror for the college boy. This
might be judged-. from recent reports of campus parking violations
by students, reports of incidents in which these violations have had
an aspect more-serious than that implied in the mere infraction of a
University regulation.
"’ ‘The University has marked sections of Alumni Drive with the
fa_m§i'l.iar yellow line. ‘There is no question among undergraduates,
Clo-vvcvcr na.-i-vpe may be their pretentious, as to the meaning of this
 ‘And yet periodic .applications of fresh paint and friendly re-
--minders from Bill Daufenbach have failed to accomplish the purpose
‘of the :si-,m:ple .regu1at_ion~s.
>. Lacking a ‘Better ‘Traffic Committee, a force of traffic police and
-the an-,ta;gon__1zing tow-truck, the University feels that it can rely en-
tirelyyion the student drivers themselves for the slight amount of
§gioo_pe-ratio'n necessary. That could hardly be called asking for too
‘-much‘.

Parking at the entrance of Alumni Hall Drive has brought the
most serious complaint. Withiin the past two weeks, Dr. A. M. Jami-
son, medical adviser to women, ha.s been delayed for dangerously
 ,pcrio.ds of time at the closed entrance while making emergency
‘trips by .automobile from her office -in Alumni Hall. Emergency cases
ltjioisng rushed to home or hospital cannot wait for a student with late
‘afternoon -classes to clear the drive.

-'Si.milar'ly, members -of the dental and medical school faculties
whose time is -divided between the University and the clinics, hos-
ypitals and private homes of the community, cannot be deprived of
the ;.pr'i',vil,eges reserved for them along the upper Alumni Drive.

-' Undoubtedly, many of the violations have been committed
ithoughtlessly the -students ‘being unaware of the reasons for having
ithe space reserved and of the eﬁect their failure to comply -with reg-

 An Engineer Speaks

VQTHERE is an article in the current issue of “The Pittsburgh Rec-

gord” that should be of particular interest to the undergraduate
student body of the University. In “Engineers for Pittsburgh ’s In-
dustries” Dr. E. A. Holbrook, dean of the Schools of Engineering
and Mines, traces the historical development of the study of engi-
-neeri-ng at the University and points out the cultural advantages of
the work that is being done here.

From his illuminating article we learn that the University early
occupied a place of pr.ominence among the institutions offering engi-
neering instruction. Since 1865, when the trustees established a
chair of engineering, the course of study has grown from a body of
elective courses in the general University curriculum to an offering
of .di.v.ersiﬁed professional instruction.

According to Dean Holbrook, the University was among the ﬁrst
six colleges of the country——and the ﬁrst or second of those west of
the Allegheny Mountains—to offer an engineering curriculum. En-
gineering -students today might be surprised to learn that their ﬁeld
of study has been included in the University curriculum for three-
quarters of a century, and that the elements of engineering have been
taughtfliere for almost a hundred years.

1 As late as 1892, when there were only 137 students registered in

the -University——which then consisted of the College, the School of
‘Engineering and the Allegheny Observatory-——‘a majority of these
‘were enrolled in engineering. We are informed that in 1905 all but
 of the freshman class of the University were engineering stu-
‘dents. Today, Dean Holbrook’s ﬁgures show, we have a total of 886
engiiiecring students enrolled in the University.
_ ‘.."Eng-ineering here places greater emphasis on the cultural as-
pects ofa college course than does instruction at either the inde-
pendent-vocational school or the independent technical school offer-
ing professional training at the college level. This is done, accord-
-ing to Dean Holbrook, so that students may be given “a background
and a point of view in engineering that we hope will enable them to
liv:-.,‘use_ful lives, and to develop in some ﬁeld of industry.”

For-the student who would continue in pure engineering work
the University offers a graduate year of advanced professional train-
ing. In this way, it meets the problem of making its engineering
graduates social-minded as well as technical-minded.

HERE is little excuse for light discussions in serious political col-
umns during such times as we are witnessing now. And further
than that, there is little excuse for a political columnist to plead a

dearth of subject matter.

In Moscow, Soviet officials are nervously tackling a case of al-
leged sabotage which involves the long unsettled state of British-

Soviet relations.

In Berlin, Adolph Hitler, who parts¢

the ancient sport of the-pogrom to
the delight of German capitalists, the
Nordic gangsters who hope to- share
in the spoils of conﬁscation, and the
ex-readers of the Dearborn Independ-
cm.

In Poland, 32,000,000 people are
wondering what they can do if Hitler
and company begins to make passes
at the Polish Corridor.

On This Continent V

In South America, Bolivia ﬁghts
Paraguay, and Colombia ﬁghts Peru,

Ramsay MacDonald, sweetheart of,

the British Labor Party, is trying to
patch up strained European relations
by means of treaties.

In the United States, there is no
less activity. Charles E. Mitchell is
indicted for income-tax evasion. The
Senate Banking and Currency Com-
mittee probes into the shady affairs
of the Harriman National. Senators
and Administration promise investiga-
tion of other banking institutions.
President Roosevelt sends ﬁve special
messages to Congress in a little more
than a week’s time. The debacle of
the Insulls .is followed by the col-
lapse of the house of Stevens. And
not so far off is a. relief plan for agri-
culture so novel that it has caught
the editors of revolutionary period-
icals with nothing revolutionary to
say.

The movement toward unprecedent-
ed and unexpected change has been
so sweeping that coeds have come out
ﬂat-footed . . that may not be the

Revolution Everywhere

And beer becomes legal on April 7.

Anything might happen now. The
R. F. C. may make a loan to the min-
ers in Harlan County. The New
Masses may publish an essay by T.
S. Eliot. E. E. Cummings may begin
writing poems which use capital let-
ters and punctuation marks.

It is hardly an exaggeration to say
that the legalization of beer marks a.
-new era in American history. And I
think that I am not far wrong in pre-
dicting that historians of future de-
cades will refer to the year of 1933
as the beginning of a. ‘new era.

In itself, beer will, of course, .have
little effect. The repercussions of its
formal recognition as a. beverage will
be more psychological than concrete.
People are going to feel differently
after April 7. They are going to feel
that they have something to say
about government after all. For since
the war there has been among the
lower classes a deﬁnite attitude of
cynicism toward doings in Washing-
ton. The preservation of prohibition

has not alone been responsible for
this attitude, but it has been the ob-
jective expression of the tyranny that

they have felt.

In public schools the teachers of
social sciences may fool the children
with old blurbs on the glory of the
Constitution and the infallibility of
public men. But ask any bricklayer
or truck driver. He may use bad
grammar and he may repeat what he

read in last night's editorial, but he

knows just as well as anybody that
the takers and Fourth of July speak-
ers are legion. In the past decade,
prohibition has been the most fruitful
source of this attitude.
The New Freedom

With beer to be obtained at the
local A. & P. or restaurant, the or-
dinary man will no longer feel that
he is contributing to the useless en-
forcement of a law which he consist-
ently breaks. In short, he is going to
feel that Washington for once has
given him what he wants.

Another factor enters this discus-
sion of the psychological effects of
Volstead Law repeal. In the past two
or three years there has been a par-
ticular affinity between beer and free-
dom in the. popular mind. Nothing at

present is so symbolic of real free---

dom as the right to buy and drink
schnapp’s little brother. And during
the next ﬁve years or so, it is going
to be mighty hard to convince a man
with a full seidel in front of him that
the Bill of Rights means nothing.

Let those who care to complain
that freedom of speech is denied to
minorities. The common man has his
beer.

Heywood Broun has suggested that
beer means a revival of socialism.
Mr. Broun is, of course, a socialist.
And like others in his party, he is ex-
tremely optimistic. American social-
ists have been predicting a revival of
socialism ever snce Debs was con-
verted. But I hope that he is right.
Beer will contribute a lot to the gen-
eral happiness of the people. But it
cannot do everything. And even if
Roosevelt is elected for a second
term, he can hardly continue to make
politics the lively show that it has
been since the fourth of this month.

With a Hey-nonny, etc.

If beer means a revival of socialism
and the peppy politics which would
surely follow, that makes the reasons
for bringing it back legally an even
two thousand.

When we get it, let us not forget
those who have fought to bring it
back. Let us not forget the politi-
cians. Let us not forget Mencken,
the Prophet of Baltimore, whose

prose poems on the subject have deep- i

ly affected public opinion both direct-
ly and indirectly.

Rhoades Speaks
To Gas Seminar

Geologist Discusses Dutch.

Indies, “Men of Borneo”

 

..—....—

“Wi1d Men frm Borneo" became a

realistic Subject to the students in oil

and gas production when Mr. Frank R.
Rhoades, a geologist of the Gulf Oil
Company, spoke to the gas seminar on
“T.he Dutch East Indies.”

For several years, Mr. Rhoades
studied conditions in the Dutch Indies.
Most of the time he was in Java,
Sumatra, and Borneo, the three main
isslands located south of the China

ea.

Mr. Rhoades gave a brief histri-
cal sketch of the islands, leading from
their discovery by the Portugese, who
were searching for spices, to the
Dutch who now control them, and dis-
cussed the uncivilized savages in the
interior of Borneo from whom has
come the expression, “the wild man
from Borneo.”

Today, there are about six cities

with a population of over 100,000 in:

the Dutch East Indies. Dutch is the
official language, but Malay is taught
in the schools. The clerks and most

Mr, Rhoades spoke briefly on the
