Versus to
attend Pitt
game-watch

Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

When the Pitt football team opens its
most anticipated season in recent mem-
ory Thursday night, students might ap-
pear on TV. A

Versus sports TV channel will send
a camera crew to the game—watch party
that will take place on the Petersen Events
Center lawn, according to an e-mail from
the athletic’ department. A 25-by-14-foot
video wall will be erected so that students
can watch the game occurring 1,800
miles away, in Salt Lake City, Utah. The

- event starts at 8 p.m., and there will be

free food and a D]. A valid student ID is
required.

The camera crew will ﬁlm students’
reactions to the game, and it might air
live after a Pitt touchdown. Versus did
this during Penguins’ playoff games when
large crowds gathered outside of the Igloo
to watch. I

E—books receive lukewarm reception on campus

John Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

Despite spending almosttwo months in 
this summer, SGB member Molly’Stieber,co,n-

tinued to push University’ administration to C

sponsor new options for students unable and
unwillingto purchase full-priced textbooks.

She made frequent Skype calls to adrr1in—
istrators and fellow board members, mean-
whﬂe juggling the 411-hourtime difference and
a handful of academic courses. V ‘

“Our vision is to totally, redo the entire
Book Center,” Stieber said shortly before re-
turning to campus. “We want to get more in
line with what students ‘really want and need
from their University bookstore.”

Her work came to fruition last week when

Pitt’s Book Center rolled out two new programs
for acquiring costly course materials. So far,
the programs have not seen an inﬂux of student
participation, Book Center staff said, but they
hope increased awarenesswillboost participa-
tion, throughout the comingsemesters.

1 . These new changes include rental services

I and T“e-book” options forlsome courses.

The e-books, available for about 140 titles,
are provided by an online publishing com-
pany called Cafescribe. Any time that there
is an e-book available for a particular text,
students will be able to grab an “é-book card”
assigned to that text and take it to the registers
for processing. T. A A,

There, Book Center staff will print an ac-
cess code on the student’s receipt that will
grant access to the book through the Cafe-
Scribe website. -

Book Center manager Debra Fyock said '

that when students purchase an e-book, they
will be able to view ﬁles of the print pages on
one computer.‘ ' ‘

Most are between 50 and 60 percent off

i the priceof a physical textbecause of reduced

printing and shipping costs.
Price  for a number of titles available

 in both print and electronic forms conﬁrmed

Fyock’s savings ﬁgures. “Brief Principles‘ of
Macroeconomics,” by N. Gregory Mankiw,

for example, costs $157.67 in print and $80.99

online —_'a savings of 49 percent.

Fyock’s colleague, fellow manager John
Burns, said few students had purchased e-
books during the ﬁrstweekof sales, despite
the potential savings.

“We haven’t sold many at all so far,” Burns
said. “We’vé had somelstudents asking ques-
tions, but they need to get more comfortable
with the idea of an electronic _book before we’ll

see the numbers go up.”

Burns said the Book Center has not cal-
culated exactly how many e-books had been
sold or textbooks rented since the programs
launched Aug. 23.

Throughout the afternoon on Tuesday, stu-
dents continued to stream in and out of the
Book Center, virtually all of them purchasing
physical textbooks. One Pitt freshman took a
moment to discuss the introduction of e-books
during the midaftemoon shuffle.

“I’m a paper kind of guy,” Pierce Cohen .

said while browsing the economics section
in the Book Center, where about ﬁve e-book
tag holders hung. “Technology isn’t always a
safe bet when it comes to education. I got in
early and bought used. That seems like the
best option.” ’

Size of new programs depends on student, buying

E-books < 1

Another student, sophomore Chris Long,
seemed more open to the idea of e-books.

“I didn’t hear anything about the program
before I bought my books,” Long said. “I think
I would try it out for one class ﬁrst, maybe
next semester. I’m not always by a computer
when I want to read, but I think I could adjust
to save that much.”

Finding the best option is a tricky business,
Fyock said, and students should consider the
pros and cons of e-books carefully prior to
purchase. For example, once they have been
accessed, they are not returnable, and they
cannot be sold back at the end of the semes-

ter.

“Students should be cautious, go to class
ﬁrst, make sure they are not going to drop a
class before accessing the code and download-
ing the book,” she said.

Fyock said the center’s ﬁrst wave of e-
books includes many of the courses with the

‘most expensive textbooks, such as biology,

chemistry and physics courses.

Textbooks in these classes can range
anywhere from $150 to more than $200,
Fyock said, and so the potential for savings
is great. '

has changed to providing as many options as
possible, Fyock said.

“If a student wants a new book because
he intends to keep it as a resource, we have it.
If someone wants‘ guaranteed buyback, or if
green issues are an important concern, we have
resources for them, as we ,” she said.

The other new option provided by the Book
Center this year is textbook renting.

Under the Book Center’s renting service,
books are shipped free of charge from various
book vendors and outlets to students through
UPS, along with a retum postage for when the
rental period is over. '

Students must use a credit or debit card
to rent books and are responsible for keeping
them in “new or like-new” condition.

Damaged books will be kept by the Book
Center, and the renter will be charged a “buy-
out price equal to the retail purchase price of
the book on the day it was rented,” according
to the Book Center website.

A textbook rental drop—oﬁ' service at the
Book Center is in the works, Stieber said, but
has not been ﬁnalized at this point.

i “This is all going to start out slowly,” Stieber
said. “If people go for the new options, then
they will start to expand exponentially.” i

PowerLink moves to Pitt

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

After working from the other side of the city for
almost two decades, an organization helping
female entrepreneurs has started working out
of the heart of Oakland.

PowerLink Inc., a 19-year-old company
formerly based in Mount Washington, has
changed its name and now runs through the
Institute for Entrepreneurial Excellence in
Posvar Hall. l - -

The group, now known as the Center for
Women in Business, offers advisory boards
— sessions aimed at guiding women through
the business creation process — ﬁnancial boot
camps and PowerLink Protégé, a program de-
signed to help start-ups get off their feet.

The nonproﬁt chose to work with Pitt be-
cause executives thought the partnership would
allow them to reach more people. . ’

“Deﬁnitely the visibility of being partof a
larger organization is working for our beneﬁ ,”
said Lee Ann Munger, the group’s executive
director. “It’s a bigger venue for getting the

. word out about our programming.”

Women with established businesses —
those that have been in operation for at least

' two years, have at least two employees and have
- at least $200,000 in armual revenue — can’

participate in advisory boards, while women
with start-ups can participate in a,PowerL‘ink
Protégé program. '

The institute’s programs range from $500 '

to $3,000. The fees give women access to lec-
tures, Pantherlabworks -— for technological
help — and the Small Business Development
Center, among others. "  .

l Ann Dugan, director of the institute, said the
addition of a center to support self-employed
female entrepreneurs is especially important
to counter gender inequality in the workplace

and that it will serve as a good example for '

business-minded Pitt students.

‘fwomensstill aren’t moving up into leader-
ship positions,” she said. “Lots of graduates
and especially female students ﬁnd self-em-
ployment a viable option.” 2

Munger also believes the center, and in-

stitute as a whole, can play a role in helping
students see the beneﬁts of self-employment
and hopes to help give students exposure to
the world of self-employment.

The center plans to "primarily work with
business owners in the immediate future, but
Munger has ambitions to include some form of
student involvement down the road.

“The institute, in general, deﬁnitely takes
advantage to work with students,” Munger said.
“There may be opportunities in the future for
students to work with us and work with our
advisory boards in somecapacity.” I

EDITORIAL

Post syllabi early, not only books

A popular way to save money in college is
to avoid purchasing bank account-draining

textbooks at all costs. This is especially good .

advice if you don’t plan on using your textbools
anyway. Isn’t that what Wikipedia is for?

Unfortunately, a Wiki-based education
probably won’t get you a Pitt degree.

But lucky for us, a new law just took effect
that hopes to help students save on the hefty
cost of textboola.

An add-on to the Higher Education Op-
portunity Act of 2008 will require textbook
publishers to inform professors of the prices of
their textbooks. This will allow professors, or
at least the nice ones, to choose less expensive
materials for their classes. . -

In addition, universities will have to provide
students with a price list of required textbooks
at the time they enroll for classes. This is meant
to give students more time to shop around for

THE Mous'rAcI-IE COLUMN

lower prices. Or, if you’re like some, itwill allow
you to quickly drop classes that require more
than three texts.

We appreciate Congress ﬁnally blowing
the whistle on textbook companies wiping out
students’ wallets. But the road toward greater

student freedom doesn’t end here — it’s only- i

one step. t

The next step is clear. We shouldn’t just have
the book list ﬁnalized before enrollment. We
should also get our syllabus before we register
for classes. , A

Many times, students do not see a syllabus
before the ﬁrst day of class. And often, students
know as soon as they see a syllabus thatjthey
don’t want to be in a class.

By seeing a syllabus well before the ﬁrst
week of a semester, students would command
more control over their ﬁnal schedules.

Because many students have to factor in

other time commitments, such as work, intem—
ships and extracurricular activities, it’s nice to
have a_good idea of what their ﬁnal class sched-
ule will look like ahead of time. And students
may often feel trapped in a class because they
have already scheduled other time commit-
ments around their courses. While having a
syllabus wouldn’t eliminate the possibility of
not liking a class, it deﬁnitely would provide
a better understanding of the class than just
a simple course description.

With syllabi available early, students would i

know exactly when textbooks are needed, al-
lowing them to purchase books throughout
the course of the semester.

Ultimately, we pay a lot for our credits and
therefore should beneﬁt from and maybe, just
maybe, enjoy them. Wielding asyllabus come
enrollment time would be a small way for Pitt
to ensure that happens.

Bateman takes booty shorts elsewhere

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

 

We’re glad you’re reading our column. This
was a really tough decision for us, and we
want to make sure you understand our rea-
sons for making it. Now don’t get us wrong:
We love The Pitt News. It’s our home.It will
always be our home. We met our ﬁrst girl-
friend here, went to prom here, dumped
our ﬁrst girlfriend here, interviewed MTV’s
Susie Meister here. The usual rites of pas-
sage, you know? p -

But when you’ve worked at a college
newspaper as long as we have, it stops
being about individual accomplishments.
Sure, we delighted readers when we
stripped down to our American Apparel
booty shorts last semester. Yeah, we know
how great we looked when we ﬂexed our
huge guns alongside bodybuilding.com’s
Jamie Eason. These things go without say-
ing. Well, almost.

’ We know all of this. Yet, it’s not enough.
We can’t keep doing the same things that.
we’ve been doing and expecting to get dif-
ferent results. That’s insanity, homies, and
even though we’re crazy like a fox, we’re
not insane. —

Nope, second place won’t cut it for us.
We need something bigger and better. We
want to be in aposition to contend for
championships every year. At TPN, we
can interview the Susie Meisters of the
world, but wouldn’t it be nice to interview
that fat, sassy girl from that more popular
MTV reality show? Who-wouldn’t leap at
the chance to learn that fat, sassy girl’s
darkest secrets?

After lengthy negotiations with the top
brass at TPN, we were unable to get the
assurances we needed. We called our mom
and said, “Momsers, why are they being so
mean to us?” She told us that we needed
to stand our ground, lest the terrorists
wind up winning. If we couldn’t meet the
fat, sassy girl and the equally popular Lady
Gaga, life just wouldn’t be worth living.

“Look,” TPN said. “We’ll give you your
own cubicle. You can hang those super-
scaldingly hot pictures of yourself in your
powder blue American Apparel booty
shorts all over it.”

“Nothing doing,” we replied. “We al-
ready have a cubicle, and we’ve already
decorated it with said super—scaldingly
hot pictures, thank you very much. And if
you can’t get us in front of America’s top
hunks and starlets, there’s no point writing
a pop culture column for you.”

Lots of people follow the Moustache
Column of America, so it wasn’t long before
the big—time offers started rolling in. We
were the top free agent in a buyer’s mar-
ket for pop culture columnists, and every
major player made us an offer.

“You can pose shirtless in each column,”
the_city’s leading free newsweekly said.
“It’ll be like that one Vanity Fair cover with
Cristiano Ronaldo and Didier Drogba on
it, only it’ll be just you and not either one
of them. How does that sound?”

Whenpressed, these newsweekly people
admitted they couldn’t get us in front of
the best celebrities.

In short order, we “elimidated” them
as surely as if they were a contestant on
the new hit TV show “The Bachelor Pad.”
“You’re ﬁred,” we said, “and that’s our ﬁnal
answer.” Those lines are, or perhaps were,
from hit TV shows too.

Finally, the student newspaper from the

neighboring research university submitted

its bid. There were a lot of numbers and

complicated formulae in their contract, but r

they explained to us that all of that gobble-
dygook meant that we would get to fulﬁll
our lifelong dreams of meetingJWoww,J.Lo
and maybe even the fat, sassy girl herself.
Since we’d harbored those lifelong dreams
for nearly a month, we accepted eagerly.

Unfortunately, opening this new and
totally amazing door means that we’ll have
to close this smaller and slightly less amaz-
ing door.

Unless you happen to get a second
chance to win a title, you ge_t only one
chance. i

We don’t know a whole lot about how
probability works, but we’re going to stay
on the safe side and plan for just the one
chance. Now, if we’ll get a second chance
to win a title while We’re working on that
ﬁrst chance, who can say? The world works
in mysterious ways.

We know how much we’ve meant to all
of you, and we hope you can ﬁnd-it in your
warm, warm hearts to forgive us. If it’s any
consolation, please remember this: We
did it for the children, and it was always
about us. ' ~

Stay sweet, true believers.

- Butwait: The Moustache Club ofAmer-
ica isn’t going anywhere. In fact, every-
one’s favorite, hot college comedy column
will be right here in The Pitt News for at
least two more semesters. Isn’t that so
wild that it’s crazy, or vice versa? And if

Live_ albums showcase talent

 

johnny Cash’s live performance demonstrates he’s just as talented outside the studio as he is in it.

Patrick Wagner
Staﬂ"Writer

Drowned—out vocals, unmatched
tempos and acoustic feedback aren’t
usually desirable, but if music is genu-
ine, it stands to reason that its perfor-
mance should be, as well.

To this day, I test my favorite
bands by their ability to play live,
even if their “live” music comes
pre—recorded and through a set of
speakers. There’s simply something
about spectacular concerts (whether
they’re exact historical records or
overdubbed into oblivion) that can

u‘ move my musical heart in a divine

way.

Though many bands have put
out worthy documentation of their
concert experiences, there are two

live albums (both recorded during
the musically loaded year of 1969)

' that show that even the passage of

40 years can’t dull the power of the
“in concert” experience.

Johnny Cash’sAt San Quentin, also
performed in aprison, was recorded
about a year after his more famous
concert at Folsom State Prison. But
with the additional support of some of
country music’s most respected talent
and a tightened setlist, the country
album out—rocks most heavy metal.

This is not the country music of
today. Carl Perkins, The Statler Broth-
ers, Mother Maybelle and the Carter
Sisters and Cash with his Tennessee
Three backing band delivered a can-
did and powerful exploration of the
human condition to many men who,
to say the least, had lived it. Cash’s

Associated Artists of Pittsburgh
100th Annual Exhibition

Now through Sept. 19 _ ,
Heinz Galleries at the Carnegie
Museum of Art

Admission free for students

When Bud Gibbons, a painter and
professor at Penn State, New Kens—
ington, heard the Associated Artists
of Pittsburgh) was approaching its
100th annual exhibition, he knew
just the painting to commemorate
the occasion.

“I was making an image that had
no relevance at all to the year 2010,”

Gibbons recalled. “I thought, ‘That

should have been made in 1910.”’
The painting, “Allegory of Time,”

' a tranquil composition of three
. ’ cows standing in their reﬂections

in a pond, is the perfect tribute to a
regional show that has stayed strong

' since the Taft administration.

The AAP, an artist-run nonproﬁt
that represents artists within a 150-
mile radiusof the city, employs dif-
ferent jurors each exhibition to select
artwork from an overwhelmingly
abundant pool of applicants. This
year, jurors Donald Miller and Al
Miner chose as many striking mod-
ern experiments as they did familiar
paint-on—canvas renderings.

For a jarring exampleof the for-
mer, visitors entering from the Scaife
stairs can direct their attention to
the far wall on the left, where Mary
Mazziotti’s eight-panel embroidery
“The Rake’s Progress” rests. A re-
imagining of the 18th-century Wil-
liam Hogarth series of etchings by
the same name, the piece follows
a character, Tom, through wealth
(“Tom Gets A Fortune”), depravity
(“Tom Goes To An Orgy”) and, ﬁ-
nally, lunacy (“Tom Goes Mad”). .

“What [Tom’s] facing, in madness
 is really his own moral death,”
Mazziotti said.

Death is a subject as central to
Mazziotti’s work as New Jersey is

to Springsteen’s -— she draws inspi- ‘'

ration’ from the_maxim “memento

its 100th exhibit

mori,” which translates to “be rnind- l

ful of death.” Rather than being a
lugubrious ordeal, however, much of
Mazziotti’s work — including “The
Rake’s Progress” —— is actually quite
humorous. Mazziotti considers this
approach a welcome alternative to
the usual seriousness surrounding
the subject.

“That’s too easy,” she said of som-
ber morbidity. “That’s what people
think of when they think of death.
It’s too easy to show the skull and

crossbones. I was trying to ﬁnd 'a ,

way to make [artwork about death]
more contemporary.”

While Mazziotti is fascinated by
our inevitable demise, she hopes
her work continues to live and
breathe.

“I hope that the work grows a bit
—— I hope that it stays contemporary,”
Mazziotti said, citing graphic novels
as a source of her inspirations.

Move further into the exhibit,
past an “advertisement” for alcohol
featuring a leering donkey (“]ackAss
Juice” by Ben Matthews) and a jigsaw
collage of Pittsburgh (“City With-
out.Art” by Dirk Vandenberg), and
you’ll soon discover a fusion of craft
and technology, appropriately titled
“Universe Expanding.” The brain-
child of AAP veteran Jane Haskell,
the piece is a computer—generated
image of stars against blackness.

“I’ve always been interested in as-
trophysics, astronomy and so forth,
although I have no background in
the sciences,” Haskell said. “This
has kind of been an ongoing thing
for me.” '

Haskell, who has been exhibiting
with the AAP since 1956, has man-
aged again and again to reinvent her
work. Her repertoire encompasses
neon —her neon sculpture “The
Tree of Knowledge” still presides
above the Schenley Café in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union — painting, sculp-
ture and photography. Haskell said
she prefers the latter three to the

‘ former.

“Even with my work in [Adobe]
Illustrator on the computer, there’s
an imaginative quality that I don’t

from the view of an inmate through a song en-
titled “San Quentin.” Immediately after its first
performance, it receives such a wildly enthu-
siastic response from the seemingly ravenous
inmates that Cash promptly plays it again.

Cash ends with several more spiritually
grounded songs (“He Turned The Water Into
Wine” and “Daddy Sang Bass”) that —— with
his ensemble including a chorus of eight — are
simply haunting.

Just a few months later, an English band that
some say deﬁnes American music would create
a live documentation that seminal rock critic
Lester Bangs famously —- and rightly — called
“the best rock concert ever put on record.”

“Get Yer Ya-Ya’s Out!”: The Rolling Stones in
Concert was recorded in New York and Balti-
more during the ﬁrststones’ tour of the United
States since 1966, three years prior.

The band came with the increased vitality
of guitar virtuoso Mick Taylor (who earlier that
year replaced ailing founder Brianjones). They
also brought a setlist that showcased not only
the Stones’ well-known classics delivered with
compelling sincerity (“Honky Tonk Woman,”
“Jumpin’Jack Flash”), but also covers of early

- rock and blues songs that are redeﬁned by The

Rolling Stones’ masterfully orchestrated electric

sound.

A cover of Robert Johnson’s “Love in Vain”
reaches new depth with Charlie Watts’ sensitive
drumming and Taylor’s aching slide guitar, mak-
ing any listener want to weep right along with
the song’s unrequited speaker. The nine-minute
plus “Midnight Rambler” shimmers as a power-
ful mini-rock opera with changing tempos (ac-
centuated by Keith Richards’ hypnotic rhythm
guitar), blistering harmonica solos and every

bell and whistle that manages to feel like the O

concentrated ecstasy of rock’n’ roll. By the time
“Street Fighting Man” hits the speakers, there

aren’t many who couldn’t be moved to believe 0

“the time is right for ﬁghting in the streets.”

V Although they’re only about 110 minutes
together, AtSan Quentin and Get Yer Ya—Ya’s Out
are documentations of their creators’ signiﬁ-
cance. When people say they lovejohimy Cash,
The Rolling Stones, country and rock music,
these albums are the reasons why. I, however,

just listen for the great music. I A a

Pitt drops 3 to tough competition

Lucas Felak I Senior Staff Photographer

Brittany Fallis sets up a serves during a Panthers home game last season. Pitt struggled in its opening games this year.

‘ Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ Writer

«:32:

The volleyball team’s early season tournament
schedule looked like an NCAA Tournament
bracket, allowing the Panthers to pinpoint
their strengths and weaknesses.
,¢.,_, Pitt fell to Dayton, Western Michigan and
Ohio State, losing every set this weekend.
In the Dayton Flyer Classic, the Panthers
fell to the Flyers, the No. 21 team in the na-
tion, in three sets with scores of 25-15, 25-13
and 25-10. .
Last year, the Flyers advanced to the sec-
‘  round of the NCAA tournament, and
Pitt head coach Toby Rens expects no less
this year.
“Dayton returned ﬁve [of six] starters this
year,” Rens said. “It was a good opportunity

to assess our team by playing such an estab- - i 

<~_k§hed‘t’ea1nasDayton-.” . . «

The,gPantllersg do. not have théluxllry of H 
such ex"perience,,because three key players

“We lost two four—yearstarters in Mea-
gan Dooley and Michelle Rossi,” Rens said.
“Early in the year, we are working to ﬁnd
the right court combinations‘ of players to
ﬁll their roles.” H

The departure of Melissa Stadelman also
left a hole. I

_ A After the Daytonltournament, the Pan-
thers traveled to Ohio State University to par-
ticipate in the Sports Imports Classic where

if the level of competition did not subside.

,. In their first match against Western
Michigan, the Panthers once. again found
themselves on the losing end of a 3-0 score
with set scores of 25-19, 25-16 and 25-21. A

' bright spot in the loss, however, was the play

of junior Lauren Hartman, who recorded 11
kills in her 19 attempts. H ‘ '
 Seniors Imani Harper and Amy Town
joined Hartman in her hitting-efforts —— each
I ended the match with nine kills.

   
 
 

         

 “Harper has shown great stabilityin her‘
jfjlay, and that in itselfwill-{allow her to emerge

 a team leader,” Rensrsaid. i?‘I havebeén‘
glpressed with herlipeii  and look;

    

Town, who earned All—Tournament Hon-
ors in the Classic, also had 11 digs against
Western Michigan and recorded 10 digs and
eight kills against Ohio State in another 3-0
loss (25-20, 25-18 and 25-19).

“Town has really stepped up for the team
this year, and I saw that starting in the spring,”
Rens said. “As the captain, she has been and
will be our go-to player.”

In the loss to Ohio State, Rens noticed the
excellent defensive play of his Panthers, who
recorded 38 digs to the Buckeyes’ 30.

“Ohio State will be a ranked team this
season, as they were last year, but I believe
we out-played them defensively,” Rens said.
“We just were not able to capitalize offensively
off‘ of our defensive efforts.”

Two young members of the Pitt team at-
tempted to make their offensive presence
known in that match, as freshman Brittany
Lhota and sophomore Michelle Walker saw
playing time at the middle and outside hitter
positions. 5 .

Lhota ﬁnished the match with seven kills

COLUMN

Hope
remains,
Bucs fans

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staﬁ Writer

Let’s just say this right away: I grew up a Pitts-
burgh Pirates fan.

Yes, there’s a support group. We meet on
Wednesdays.

I blame my dad, but it’s not really his fault.
He witnessed a completely different era of
Pirates baseball, back when people in Pitts-
burgh could attend a game and have it actually
mean something other than free merchandise.
Hedidn’t know what he was getting me into
the ﬁrst time he took me to a game when I
was ﬁve. .

But even after all the losing seasons, my
dad is still a Pirates fan. He watches every
game and drives the two hours to PNC Park
several times each summer.

And near the middle of every season, right
around the time when we both realize what
we already knew —.— that the Pirates are going
to end the season with an embarrassingly
familiar losing record — my dad will repeat
the mantra of every disappointed sports fan:
“There’s always next year.”

As the Pirates enter the last month of their
18”‘ straight losing season, it’s about time for
the eternal optimists among us to start utter-
ing that exact phrase, a phrase that the team
should just consider taking up as their motto.
Either that or, “He’s good. Let’s trade him.”

“Pride. Passion. Pittsburgh Pirates,” just
doesn’t seem to ﬁt.

But I digress. The point of this column isn’t
to lament the hopelessness of the organiza-
tion. Instead, I’m actually going to argue that
hope for the future does exist — although, a
more distant future than next year. Let’s not
get crazy here. _

That hope comes in the form of the Pirates
youthful quartet of Andrew ’McCut\chen, Neil

Walker, Jose Tabata and Pedro Alvarez, Even I

as the Pirates spiraled to the league’s worst
record and tortured fans by allowing Charlie
Morton to throw a baseball, these four players

‘provided a light, ‘however small, at the end

of the very long, very dark tunnel that is the
Pittsburgh Pirates organization.

Pirates 4 8

First up, McCutchen. Pirates fans knew,

exactly what they were going to get from
McCutchen heading into this season: a light-
ening quick, top-caliber center ﬁelder who’s
reliable at the plate.

He leads the team in triples (5), doubles
(25) and stolen bases (26). Right now, Mc-
Cutchen is the face of the organization, the
kind of player the Pirates can build the team
around if they choose to do so — let’s hope
that they actually stick to their word this
time.

Not only is he a fun player to watch and
a quality leader on the ﬁeld, but McCutchen
also says all the right things off the ﬁeld. He
speaks of excitement and energy in the Pi-
rates clubhouse convincingly enough that,
even if he doesn’t believe it, maybe his team-
mates do.

And while many people say the center
ﬁelder will end up in a Yankees uniform
sooner rather than later, the Pirates control
McCutchen’s rights through 2015.

As for Neil Walker, it’s hard not to love his
story. Not only has he proven to be a qual-
ity second baseman, but the born and bred
Pittsburgh native and Pine-Richland High
School graduate made the Pirates relevant
again for people of the Steel City.

Even the most jaded Pirates fan had to
smile when Walker’s ﬁrst major league home
run was a game winner in his hometown.
Even better for Walker, who was six years
old the last time the Pirates had a winning
season, playing for his hometown team is a
dream come true.

If Walker gets to be a part of the Pirates’
ﬁrst winning season since he was in elemen-
tary school, it would almost be something out
a movie script.

Rookie Tabata leads the Pirates with a .312
batting average. Since being recalled onjune
9, he ranks third in the Major Leagues in hits
(87), behind only the Rockies’ Carols Gonza-
lez (89) and the Cardinals’ Albert Pujols (88).
He’s leading the National League in batting
average since the All—Star Break (.362).

Tabata is having the same kind of success
that McCutchen did as a rookie last year. Odds
are, he won’t continue improving at this pace,
but he’s a player for Pirates fans to get excited
about. He’s patient at the plate —— rare for a
rookie — and, like McCutchen, he’s fast, both
on the base paths and in the outﬁeld.

The most highly anticipated call-up this
season was Alvarez. He’s the player Pirates
fans have been waiting on since he was draft-
ed second overall in 2008. Alvarez struggled

at the plate more than most expected early
on, but he’s provided more than his fair share
of highlights since then —- none more spec-
tacular than his game-winning home run
on Aug. 8.

' It was one of the greatest ﬁnishes in PNC
Park history, which in all honesty isn’t saying
much, but still. Go with it. A1varez’s three-run
home run in the 10th inning gave the Pirates a
one-run victory over the Colorado Rockies.

The sold-out crowd of 38,147 ~ who were
mostly there for the ﬁreworks and concert,
but again, go with it — rose to their feet and
cheered like the game actually meant some-
thing. People were excited about baseball. In
Pittsburgh. Because of the Pirates. I swear,
I’m not lying.

What all this boils down to is this: despite
the worst record in Major League Baseball,
the 18—straight losing seasons‘ and general
apathy from people in Pittsburgh, there was
actually a reason to go to PN C Park this year,
beside maybe getting a free T-shirt.

And if the Pirates can keep this core four
together and if they can ﬁnd some starting
pitching, there is a chance we’ll get to see
a baseball game in Pittsburgh that actually
means something —- maybe not next year,
but at least in one of the next 18. I

while Walker, in her ﬁrst start, earned four
kills in the ﬁnal set of the match. «e=s:=

“We look forward to the progression of
our younger players,” Rens said. “This early
exposure to tough competition will help the
entire team as we begin our season.”

The Panthers will face Kent State, another
NCAA Tournament contender, before return-
ing to the Fitzgerald Field House for the Pitt
Invitational Tournament where they will meet
Purdue in the ﬁrst home match Friday.

“Purdue willbe another great challenge
for us,” Rens said. “As members of the Big
Ten'Conference, they face teams like Penn
State on a regular basis and compete on that
level consistently.” .

Despite an early 0-3 record, the Panthers
remain conﬁdent that they have beneﬁtted
from their early losses. .

“While we have not come away with wins,
I feel that we have come away with experi-
ences that will enable our team to grow,” Rens
said. “As we continue to work hard and come
together as a team, I believe that there will
be some exciting volleyball here at Pitt this
fall.” I ‘
