C1. Editor Chris Gillotti ha’S stated
that the book is “all Ba; and
done in a completely different
style from the previous books.”

 Gillotti explained that formerly
the style has been to cram as

~ many small pictures as possible on

one page. In the past few years,

however, a new, style has been“

‘-adopted in many yearbooks which

' uses white space liberally to em-

This has been
done in this year’s Owl. —.

‘ The book attempts to present, an
overall picture of the school,

V rather than just small segments of
school life. “It is not a college,”
stated the Editor, “but a mural.”
F", Business Manager Will Hoel

explained, “We _ordered . 300’

extra books,‘ and I hope this will

be a sufficient amount for all
7‘ those who didn’t have a chance
to order their books earlier this
V year." '

'Since ‘the books are’ late this
year, and since" there is only less
than’ a week ofschool, Hoel stated
that he hoped to have all the
books in the hands of the students
by a week from Friday.

The books will also be on sale

$8.28. Students’, who have placed

Panthers, -Lions, Clash E
To Decide NCAA Berth

. , By TED COLTON
Penn State will provide the Panthers with their toughest
test of the season as both teams battle for a berth in the
NCAA "tournament this afternoon in a doubleheader at Uni-

versity Park.

Coach Joe Bedenk’s Lion squad has represented this dis-

trict in the tourney for the past seven years with the excep-
tion of 1954. The" Lions have an- ‘T -

other strong team that has com-
piled a 12-2 record so far this
season.

Leading Penn State in hitting
is Rightﬁelder Dick Delong, who

“has a .363 batting average along

with 11 runs batted in. Following
him are Larry Fegley .353 and 18
rbi’s, and Ron Hoover .321 and
15 rbi’s, Hoover also has two
home runs. . '
The Lions. and the Panthers
have met four common oppon-
ents. Penn State defeated Buck-
nell twice, Navy and West Vir-
ginia once and split a double-
header with Syracuse. 1.
Coach Bobby Lewis’ mitters
have swept a doubleheader from
Syracuse, defeated Bucknell and

West Virginia in single games and '

lost to Navy. ,
The probable starting line up
for Penn State will be; Dick Lan-
dis—3b, Tom Durbin——lf, Fegley——
rf, Hoover——ss, DeLong—rf, Chuck
Caldwe1l——cf, Bill .Benton——1b,
and Harry Beans and John Adams
will take turns behind the plate
in the doubleheader. ’ .
Ed Kikla, Lion ace hurler, is
not slated for the mound‘ as-
signment but Lewis expects that
Bedenk will‘ go with his number
one man anyway. Ron Riese
and Bob Arner have been named
by the Lion’s tutor to start
against the Panthers. Riese has
a 8-0 recordwhile Arner has.
been in four games but has
_ failed to come up with a deci-
sion.

Lewis will throw ace Bill Ham-
ilton and either Bob Conti or Dick
Wirth.‘ Hamilton (4-0) will be
fresh off twoone-hit games. Wirth
is Lewis"present choice, but he
may change his mind before game
time.

“This_ is like the seventh game
of the World‘ Series and we’ll have
everybody__ ready to throw- at
them,” stated the Panther mentor.
Wirth has a record__o

Judgment 

SGA Receives Letter
From Swartibaugh
Concerning Phi Cam
The Oﬁice of the Dean of Stu-

dents has agreed to review‘with'

Phi Gamma Delta the decision
which placed the social fraternity-
onprobation because they Vio-
lated certain University rules.'Re-
cently Student Government Asso-
ciation recommended that the
office reconsider its judgment.

Dr. William Swartzbaugh,'dean ‘.
of ‘Students, agreed with many of '

the opinions that SGA offered as
reasons for review of the case. He
wrote in a letter to the govern-
ing bocly, “We shall proceed di-
rectly with the. fraternity involv-
ed.”

In regards to the statement‘ from
SGA that “no student judicial
body was asked to participate in
this decision” he said, “This ‘is
true.” But, he added that there was
no functioning SGA judiciary body
at that time to handle the situa-
tion. ‘

SGA questioned why there
was “no privilege of appeal
granted to the involved frater-
nity.” Dr. Swartzbaugh said
that when the fraternity did
come to him he advised them to
refer their case to SGA. .

In‘ reply to the statement of
“inconsistency in recent judg-

ments regarding other fraternityv

violations of accepted conduct,” he
said that the lumber and Phi Gam

situations were handled by dif- '

ferent judiciary bodies; therefore
one can’t say there was any in-
consistency.

‘?There is an apparent lack of
clarity as to how‘ such violations
will be handled,” SGA stated. Dr.
Swartzbaugh replied, “This is a
fact.” _ _

Kent Jarrell, president of SGA
commented, “This leads into the
results of the Student Affairs

Committee w h o s e comments
_ were‘ extremely positive on the

ideas of a judiciary system being

established immediately.’’_

In other new business com-

.plaints have recently been made ,

to SGA concerning the functioning
of Office Services. Richard Stein,
Public Relations Committee chair-
man made a motion that SGA in-
quire into this situation. The ap-
