  Police accused of using excessive force

By Julie Sabol and

Pete Kapustynski
The Pitt News

Witnesses to an arrest at the
Beehive Coffeehouse on Forbes
Avenue Wednesday said two mem-
bets of the Pittsburgh Police hit,
then arrested two men without
obvious cause. .

The two men arrested were
Beehive employees David
VanderVoort and Mark. Choi,
according to an arrest report.

They were arrested by ofﬁcer C.
Marks of the traffic division. No

K  campus pOllC€\Oll’\lC€l‘S were on the



scene at the time of the incident.
‘The conflict began when a

Pittsburgh Police officer had Choi’s

motorcycle put onto a ﬂatbed truck,

according to the arrest report

Sergeant Robert Lewicke in the war-
rant department said.

“My motorcycle got towed and
after half an horn‘ of fairly pleasant
conversation with the officer, it was
obvious I wasn’t going to get my
motorcycle back so I went back
inside,” Choi said last night after
being released from jail on $25,000
bond '

As the police officer, Marks,
pulled away, VanderVooit, a friend

of Choi’s said, “I hope the world
treats you well," according to eye
witness Pitt law student Michael
Diinaggio, as well as Choi.

Dimaggio, who was sitting at a
table outside of the Beehive, said he
witnessed the entire scenario in
front of the Beehive and wrote
down everything he saw and hand
in one of his textbooks.

Dimaggio said he did not person-
ally know either Choi or
Vandei'Voo1t, he only recognized
VanderVooit by face because he
had seen him in the Beehive a few
months earlier. ‘

Baby savedfromoncommg traﬂic

Byjohn Temple
sum’ Writer

“The kid was tough,” said
Wayne Bobak, referring to the 27-
month-old baby boy he rescued
yesterday morning after it fell out
of a moving car on Forbes
Avenue.

Bobak, who works at The
Pittsburgh Stop outside vendor,
adopts a tough image of himself

- among the students to whom he

sells sweats. “I like to keep up the
‘Mr. Hardass’ image — Archie
Bunker,” he said.

But the image dropped when
he heard the toddlers cry yester-
day. l
“I looked out and saw it trying to
get up, and I ran out there, I didn’t
know if cars were coming‘ or
what,” Bobak, who was reluctant
to talk about the incident, said.

The baby’s mother, who was
driving the car, told police that the

child had unbuckled the seat belt
and opened the door himself
before falling out. Bobak said the
baby did not seem to be badly
injured but he insisted on calling
for help. . V I

“I was running around looking
for quarters to make the call, for-
getting 911 is free,” Bobak said. “I
was holding the kid so hard I
thought I was going to hurt it.”

Bobak said he held the baby
until the police arrived.

ment, Dimaggio said Marks stopped
the car, got out, and told
VanderVooit to “come here."

“This policeman said ‘come here.’
lVanderVooitl jttst stood there. He
said it again, ‘come over ‘here.’ Then
he grabbed lVanderVooitl by the.
neck and slammed him against the
door,” Beehive employee and wit-
ness of the incident Kevin Berk said.

‘This guy (the officer) comes ﬂy-
ing across and . ripped
lVanderVooit‘s] shirt. He pinned him
down and was squeezing his throat

which is shown by the bruises on-

his throat,” Choi said.
The police officer then had him

on the ground with one hand hand-
cuffed behind his back, according to
Dimaggio, Ieit, eye-witness Heather
Bavola, Beehive employee and wit-
ness Leslie Drinovan. witness Kevin
Berk and others at the scene.

“The police officer told
lVanderVooitl to stop struggling and
he said Tm not struggling because
I’m trying to resist, I’m struggling
because you aren‘t letting me
breathe,” Choi said. “The guy kept
leaning onto his throat for about
three minutes and then picked him
up by his throat and threw him a

Vice Chancellor Tuchi
expects responsibility
in business and finance

By Beth Kovaly
Staff Writer

No excuses and greater
accountability — that’s how
Vice Chancellor of Business
and Finance Ben Tuchi said he

views theresponsibility of his

office.
Tuchi sent out several ines-
sages in the first meeting for

the top three levels of the busi- ’

ness and finance department.
One of the messages he deliv-
ered was reassurance.

“I had said previously in‘May

. that organizational changes
were probable, but I wouldn't
really have them detailed until
August. I felt duty-bound to lay
out the organizational changes
and to indicate that the.likeli-
hood of any additional [ones] in
the near future was small. It
was virtually intended to
relieve that uncertainty,” Tuchi
said. '

Several of the major changes

that T uchi is making deal with _

regrouping different functions
of the university. The business
functions, such areas as food
service, housing, The Book
Center and transportation have
now been delegated to
Assistant Vice Chancellor for
Business and Finance John

DeVitto.
Another area of reconstruc-

tion occurred in control func-
tions, such as the cashier's

office and invoice audits, wliicli
were placed in the controller‘s
responsibility. ,

‘‘There’s much more of a logi-
cal structure in respect of con-
trol of the university’s cash -
its investments,” Tuchi said.
“You get a much more efficient
way of controlling the whole
payment process, of paying
bills on time.”

A third area of structuring
places planning activities under
the assistant vice chancellor of
budget administration.

In addition to structural
changes, Tuchi said the meet-
ing sent a message of responsi-
bility. “There’s a need for mak-
ing change in the way in which
we do things because weare
going to be held increasingly
accountable by all of our con-
stituencies: legislators, students,
faculty, ‘staff, Tuchi said.

“The old era is over. We had
to take the lead in being better
managers. I don’t mean to por-
tray that the [functions] were
widely scattered, but they cer-
tainly weren’t centralized.

“I feel strongly that changes

Sexual assault occurs

Despite the presence of heavy bars on all windows, an uniden-
tiﬁed attacker entered a 21-year-old female Pitt student’s bedroom
on Chesterfield Road at 3:00 a.m. last Friday.

According to the police report, Jennifer Mitchell said that she
was awakened by an unknown person tickling her butt and legs.
When she screamed the man told her to shut up or he would kill

In the last column, a num-
ber of the problems facing

6‘ new students at Pitt were

reviewed. One problem that
was not discussed has to do

with the developmental rami-.

fications of becoming a" col-
lege student.

Whether or not students
commute or live on camptrs,
the beginning of college usu-

ally marks a significant move

toward psychological inde-
pendence from the family and
from an earlier style of life.
Separating psychologically,
i.e., establishing your own
identity, is a difficult process

- that ‘begins in early childhood

and continues well into adult-
hood. ‘
Most students would like to
think that the process is com-
plete when they leave high
school and assume their col-
lege identity. Rarely, howev-

per, is it that easy.

Some students make the
transition to college fairly eas-
ily.’ They have little trouble
leaving high school friends

behind and may find that
their new status results in a
less conflicting relationship

omy.

Those who find themselves
attempting to prove their
independence by engaging in
excessive or risky activity
might need to step back and
assess their personal goals.
On the other hand, students
who become immobilized by
separation anxiety and with-
draw socially will need to
draw upon their inner
resources to face the fear and
break out of their isolated sta-
IUS.

Talking to trusted friends
about these identity struggles
is a good place to start, but
there are many other
resources at the university.

in helping students with these

Cultural diversity nourishes the body as Well as the mind

year‘s festival.

Dr. Burkart Holzner, direc-
tor of the University Center
for International Studies, said
that “we celebrate diversity
for its richness. but we have
to work to make it prosper.”

The final speaker of the
opening ceremonies talked
from her three—wheeled vehi-
cle. Lois O‘Donnell, a senior
at Pitt, spoke on diversity for

‘several different reasons.
'O’Donnell brings motherhood

and grandparenting as diver-
sity to Pitt, along with a
physical impairment.

“I hope to break the ice
between the non-handi-

capped and the handi-
capped,“ O"Donnell said.
Being “physically challenged"
becomes a “sub—cultui‘e" for
diversity. Physically chal-
lenged people hold ties not
through race or religion, but
through their disability, she
said.

O’DonnelI went on to say
that opportunities through
diversity are many at Pitt. “If
you leave Pitt without touch-
ing someone, it’s your own
fault,” O’Donnell said.

Also participating in the

festival were the Men’s Glee

Club and Beautiful Hands,
who performed a dance and

A program promoting under-
standing and growth between chil-
dren and elders, “Generations
Together” links the age gap and
makes a dilference.

“This program is a program in
which everyone wins,” said Linda
Deafenbaugh, the program coordi-
nator of Generations Together.
“The elders benefit by having a
meaningful volunteer opportunity,
the students benefit with addition-

. :11 individual attention from older,

caring adults, and the schools ben-
efit from greater community
involvement.”

The program involves people

age 55 and older who want to vol-
unteer their time working closely
with teachers and helping students
strengthen their academic and
social skills.

The volunteers are essentially
teachefs aides who are responsi-
ble to assist the classroom teacher.
Training includes an information
session, a school tour and class-
room observation before begin-
ning the program.

Generations Together develops
reputable, intergenerational pro-
gram models. They also conduct
research on the impact the pro-
gram has on the people it
involves. The program assists in
implementing the model once it is
adopted by a school and also
trains the schools on how the pro-
gram works. '

“The kids today are basically
dealing with the same problems
we dealt with,” Robert Butler said
who volunteers along with his

.wife Ester. __ “They need a positive

influence from the older genera-
tion and also need a connection
between the generations.”

the help of two volunteers also
working in the school.

“Elders can relate to children on
a different level than teachers can,”
Marge D’Eramo, coordinator of
South Side Area School District,
said. Many children don’t have
grandparents or contact with
elders, and it isfrom the older
generation that they can learn an
appreciation of the past, explained
D’Eramo who is also the school’s
guidance counselor.
She said she feels that the program
is great because it connects the
generation gap while getting the
community involved with the
schools. ,

“My biggest concern is getting
more volunteers, not teachers,”
D’Eramo said. Teachers at the

_and Urban Research.

South Side Area School are
becoming more and more interest-
ed in using volunteers in their
classrooms. When the program

began, six teachers wanted the ,

aid. This number has increased as
teachers are ﬁnding that elders are
very compatible with the children,
she said.

D’Eramo, a teacher herself for 15
years, explains that incorporating a
volunteer into a classroom
requires extensive planning but
enables the teachers to do projects
they would not be able to do
without the special help.

Generations Together is part of
the University Center For Social
Since 1978,
the Senior Volunteer program has
begun intergenerational programs
in more than 20 Western
Pennsylvania school districts,
involving over 500 volunteers and

300 teachers.

Rideout proposes plan to beef up security in city school system

By Pete Kapustynski

Asst. News Editor

Security Chief for City Schools
Stanley Rideout is asking for more
metal detectors and the ability to turn
off pay phones in the hopes of
preventing gang-related killings from
entering city schools.

“I think it’s a good idea [to turn off
the pay phonesl,” Peabody High

"School Senior Vice Principal Janice

Dunmire said.
“We know gang members use them
to request additional members of their

community to be outside the school at
dismissal time,” Dunmire said.

Dunmire said this is not a new prob-
lem.

“It’s new for city officials to admit
that there is a problem. However,
school administrators have been deal-
ing with this for years,” Dunmire said.

Metal detectors are in‘use at Peabody
following a gang-related shooting
that. took place near the school on
Friday.

Rideout said the metal detectors at
Peabody are temporary ones that are
usually used at football games, and he

wants additional ones.

“I would like to have one for every
school that could be taken out and
used when needed,” Rideout said.

Dunmire said they had an indication
in the spring that there would be trou-

ble this year.
“Over the summer some of the stu—
dents took an interest in some

unhealthy extracurricular activities.
Now they’re trying to bring them
into the school,” Dunmire said.
According to Rideout, most of the
gang members are former students,
some of whom have younger brothers

Diversity

Continued from page 3
Caribbean Student
Association, said they want to
teach others of their presence
on campus. Louise Simmons,
an undergraduate student at
Pitt and a member of the CSA
hopes to make other students
of Caribbean descent aware
of their organization.

“We want them to feel they
have someone to relate to,”

Simmons said. “[Someone
who will] try to support and
assist them.”

Other groups not only
hoped to make sense of the
rest of the world here in
America but also want to
show off the rest of the
world at large. Groups such
as Study Abroad and
Semester at Sea, along with
an international business

‘group called AIESEC, all offer

a chance to see the world
and its diversity first-hand.

AIESEC brought diversity
from CM in a joint effort with
the University of Pittsburgh.
“Conferences to bring people
from all over the world to
work in Pittsburgh are held,”
member Brenda Batenbtirg
said, then “we send people
out.” ‘ P

in Peabody who want to join the
gangs.

Rideout says he is trying to warn
these kids about the serious conse-
quences of violating s‘chool rules.

“Especially where it involves gang-
relatedvactivity. They will be dealt with
very harshly,” Rideout said.

“What no one is asking is why is this
happening? It’s black kids killing and
shooting other black kids. It doesn't
make any sense.

Wlrat we need someone to look into
this and give us a prescription for a
cure," Rideout said.

Fraternity rush ends with record amount of participants

By Christine Hanna
Asst. News Editor

While the menare finishing, the

women are just beginning Fall Rush, .

1,992. .
‘Four-hundred-fifty-five men went
through rush, which is best to date.
Total results will not-be known until
after today Edward, Ifft, the
Interfraternity Council Rush chairper-
son, said.

“[The totals] are up from‘ last year

pretty nicely,” IFC Internal Vice-

" President Dave Matta said. “Rush

itself was a very big success,” he
said.

IFC External Vice President
Christopher Block said that most fra-
ternities are doing better than in the
past two or three years.

According to Matta‘, the number of
men going through the fraternity
housesand attending Greek events
was high.

“I have spoken to a lot of presi-
dents who are happy,” Block said.

“Everybody is starting to get the-

same number [of pledgesl,” Ifft said.
Before some fraternities would get 30
men, while another would get five.
Now the number is “even across the
board,” averaging around 18.

Matta said that a mid-term rush is
being considered for the smaller
houses that are still not where they
would like to be.

Wednesday was the last day for
sorority registration, but Panhellenic
Association Vice President Jennifer
Fink said that they will keep it open
until Thursday night.

“As far as I know, there are 400
girls registered,” Fink said. Last year,
420 girls registered, and the quota for
each house was around 31.

“I think the numbers are the same,
and the quota will be the same,” Fink
said. '

Fink said that everything during ‘fall

rush has run smoothly, considering -

that Bridget Guernsey, the Greek
Advisor, left.

Fink said that the rushees are very
enthusiastic and excited. They had
great questions to ask at the Question
and Answer.night.

The sororities are also equally excit-
ed to get new members, meet new
people and teach the new pledges
about the chapter, Fink said.

“We try not to stress one sorority
more than another," Fink said. “We

also try to explain that it is just not
social  but also Greek Week and
the blood drives. - .

“We also tell them that going

'through"Rush is a great way to meet

people.”

Fink said that it is especially good
for first-year students to get to know
people even if they do not go
through rush.

“Our sole purpose is to support
going Greek and not just one sorori-
ty,” Rho Chi rush counselor B.J.
Strawser said.

Fink said that the Panhellenic
Board, the Rush Committee Board
and the Rho Chis are not wearing
their letters or going out in large
groups with their sisters so the
rushees will go into rush open-mind-

and was trying to handcuff the
other, the witnesses said.

0 While the officer was trying to
liandculf VanderVoorfs other hand,
afemale entered the scene, the wit-

nesses said.
“This woman comes out of

nowhere and stepped on
VanclerVoort’s tluoat at which point
I grabbed onto her belt and pulled

to "hit me; She then grabbed onto

and went into the Beehive,” Choi
said

“She didn’t identify herself until
after she hit him,” Bavola said.

After Choi went inside, the female
and male offrcersconversed and
called for backup, according to
Dimaggio. ’

A crowd of people that gathered
began to protest the treatment of the
two men, according to witnesses.

“Someone in the crowd said this
would look bad in the press and the
plainclothes [officer] said “There is no
press,” Berk said.

When bystanders asked for the
woman's name and badge number,
she.said,”I don’t have to give you
“anything,” according to Dimaggio.

Choi said he was in the Beehive
for a while until he was told the
police were getting a warrant to
sarrch the place for him, he said.

“I lost my mind for a minute and
went out the back door. There were
police otlicers waiting there for me,”
Choi said.

Someone began to pass around a
sheet of paper and people who saw
what happened wrote down their
names and phone numbers, accord-
ing to a witnesses.

Someone wrote down the license
number and markings of the police
car on the same sheet, according to
Berk.

According to the arrest report,
VanderVoort was arrestedat 5:14
p.m. for resisting anest and disorder-
ly conduct. Choi was arrested for
aggravated assault and obstructing
justice.

“When we got downtown, they
took all our stuff, even our
shoelaces, and put us in a six foot
by 8 foot cell,” Choi said.

Choi said he was released around

2 a.r_n. with a 25,000 bond and that '

VanderVoort had been released

somewhat earlier than he had.

V anderVoort could not be
rarclred for comment.

Neither officer Marks -or the
female oiiicer could be reached for
comment.

“Its my understanding the Oll'lCCI'S

 education now

A recently released report from the Allegheny County
Health Department shows that 15 percent of all
African-Americans are newly infected with the AIDS
Virus.

While the number of AIDS cases has grown in the
black community, it has declined from 85 to 65 percent
in the homosexual, bisexual and white heterosexual
communities.

These statistics show, on the one hand, that education
programs are working in the heterosexual and gay com-
munities. Both of these groups l1ave mobilized well and
have done much to halt the spread of this deadly dis-

ease. It just goes to show there are positive results to

/

“getting the word out.”

Minority communities, on the other hand, have not

-been so lucky. Therefore, those same educational pro-
grams must now be instituted in the black community.
One -of the problems concerning increased AIDS educa-
tion is that much of" the funding in inner—city areas
comes from local taxation. Obviously then, those who
are from the most economically depressed areas will
suffer the most. ’ S — ,

In order to help eliminate the problem, the least

. wealthy communities must receive greater subsidization

from local, federal and state governments. The other
cost that we are talking about -—- the potential loss of
millions of lives + is much more expensive.

Celebrate diversity

For the rest of‘ this week, cultures from all over the
globe will be meeting and sharing ideas with the the
university community. No, the University of Pittsburgh
is not hosting a meeting of United Nationsgdelegates —-
we are celebrating‘ the diversity which makes this a
world-class institution. There are food fairs and music.
But the diversity is much more than just those things. It
is mostly a chance for individuals from all over the
world to get together and share their ideas and dreams.

The differences between peoples are obvious. The
real problem for people is finding the similarities. But it
isn’t difficult to do. All you have to do is talk to some-
one. Remember that you are a product of diversity any-
way, for diversity is the very thing upon which this
nation’s foundations were built. '

But most importantly, the cultural diversity represents
a goal that we should all have in common. Every year
world leaders meet in numerous summits to solve the
World’s problems. But chances are the problems won’t
be solved at this level. The real solution lies in the type
of exchanges occurr ing these next two days at Pitt. It _is

a quest for peaceful understanding between peoples. If I

you don’t get involved, weall lose.

The winner of the Truman award

_ For the past couple of weeks
I have heard and read
President Bush compare him-
self to Harry Truman. Harry
Truman was a democrat and a
forerunner of liberalism in the
United States. President Truman
fought against the “Do-nothing-
Congress,” and even proposed
a National Health Care Plan.
Although George Bush claims
he also has a “Do—nothing-
Congress,” the record shows
that Congress passes bills, and
George Bush vetoes them —
which in turn stops the legisla-
tive "process. Then ‘President
Bush ‘tellsthe public that
Congress does not work and
that the problems are the result
of Congress’ failures. -
The problem is a President
that is unwilling to change. I
agree with Bill Clinton when he
said “Step aside Mr. President”
and let Congress and a new
president work together.

Todd A. Williamson

I

In (Debating Primates, Sept.‘

15, 1992), you addressed the
issue of the morality of
baboon—to-human liver trans-
plants. You appealed to the
notion of “survival of the fittest”
as justification for the use of
baboon livers in human trans-
plant operations. The essence
of your reasoning seems to be:
(1) Humans are capable of
using reason for their self-
preservation; (2) Human self-
preservation sometimes
requires the destruction of
organisms of other species; (3)

But the tendency for self‘-”‘

preservation is “the way nature
works,” (4) Therefore, we are
justified in destroying other
organisms to preserve human
life. The suggestion is that the
practice of baboon-to-human
liver transplants is just one
example of the principle of
“survival of the fittest” at work
and thus is morally acceptable.

This reasoning is frightening.
Darwin recognized that the
“survival of the fittest” refers
not only to interspecific but
intraspecific as well. One might
then morally justify the destruc-
tion of mentally retarded and
aged humans, if that would
promote the survival of the
intelligent and youthful. You
pose the question: “If the life of
a loved-one was threatened,
and it came between one’s
mother and the life of a

Letters

baboon then which one is cho-
sen?” I ask: “If the life of a
loved-one was threatened, and
it came to choose between

-one’s mother and an unknown

retarded stranger then which
one is chosen?” I suggest that
simplistic appeals to the “sur-
vival of the fittest” won’t help
us to answer these questions.

One illustration shouldmake
my point. Tajchman’s group,
Men against Rape and
Pornography, also works in the

gay, lesbian and bisexual com-
’munity of Pittsburgh trying to

get gay women and men to
stop) using their own pornogra-
phy because it “objectifies”
people.

Although [gay, lesbian and
bisexual] erotic materials can in
no way be considered sexist,
we have the spectacle of pro-
feminist groups opposing eroti-
ca made by women for

women, in the name of “libera-
tion."

The a‘nti—pom groups‘ differ-
entiation of good and bad sex-
uality seems to go like this:
You may think about some-
ones naked body landl you
may look at that body, but if
you look at it long—distance via

any medium it is “objectifica-

tion.” This is at base an anti-
erotic argument, and does

nothing to combat sexism or ,

homophobia.

Nathan Miller

The Perspective article of
Sept. 2, which advocated the
establishment of a “no—fly
zone” assumed that this action
is motivated by nothing other
than humanitarian interests.

If the (United States) is truly

concerned about the quality of »

life of the Iraqi people, why is
the economic blockade, which
blocks even medicine and
food, still in place? The Iraqi
people have endured epidemic
levels of cholera, ‘typhoid and
gastroenteritis, which naturally
harmed the weakest the most.
Yet this January, Saddam
Hussein and his national guard
were comfortable enough to
give themselves a pay raise.
The chaos has only made the
Iraqis more dependent on what
their government can provide,
not prepared for revolution.
Furthermore, why was the
infrastructure of Iraq bombed,
including water-purification
centers, the electrical grid, hos-
pitals, pharmaceutical facilities,
food production [sites], civilian
communications and schools?
Are these really military targets?

"Even many members of the

original alliance against Iraq

have given no support.

Can we believe that the Bush
administration is moved solely
by moral responsibility?

Pomtber volleyball spikes scrappy Dukes, 3-]

Cory Walborn

« Sta_ﬁ' Writer

Duking it out Duquesne last
night. the Pitt volleyball team
ended the two-hour slugfest
with a resounding knockout of
the visiting Dukes. '

Playing the match in what

seemed like two halves,
Pitt started out poorly
but came back strong. Taking
three games out of four

from Duquesne, Pitt opened
its first home match with a vic-
tory.

"\Y/’e were real scattered in
the beginning of the match,“
head coach Sue Woodstra said.
“But we have good enough
players and athletes to come
back." S

Coming back is whatthe
Panthers had‘ to do after games
one and two. Pitt seemed a
bit nervous in its first. home
match, and it showed as they
fell behind in the first two
games.

In game one, Pitt and a

scrappy Duquesne team traded’

spikes as well as erroneous
serves that started a sloppy
trend. Duquesne was a little
crisper at the start and darted
out _to a 7-4 lead.

But sophomore outside
hitter Chelsea Hemingway’s
wicked serve turned
the" Panthers around. After
five straight points the
Panthers were on top with a
score of 12 to 7. Hemingway’s
hard, straightserve baffled
the Dukes throughout the
match.

“[Hemingwayl always brings
a positive emotion to this

Melanie Gustafsonv and Chelsea Hemmingway combine to stuff this Duquesne attack.

team,” Woodstra said of one of
her most improved players.
“She does a great job against
teams like Duquesne.”

It was Hemingway’s serve
that ignited a fire that spread to
Pitt’s entire team. Junior Ann
Marie Lucanie, sophomore mid-
dle hitter Melanie Gustafson

and

sophomore Carrie
Thornton all contributed nice
spikes en route to a 15-9 win.
Lucanie, who had an off night
hitting the ball, was still ﬂaw-
less with her passing and
defense.

Duquesne was led by Stacy

Gilligan (14 kills overall) and _

Jennifer Vuich (7 kills). Gilligan
was also very impressive on
defense and had a whoppin
27 digs. ‘
Game two" started the same
way game one began. Sloppy
play by both teams led to

Double OT
goal lifts
Pitt over
Geneva

By Bennett Zamoff

' For The Pitt News

On Tuesday, the head
coach of Geneva College
called him the “most pro-
ficient player" on the
Panther soccer team. Last
night he was the most
valuable.

Pitt midfielder Eric Prex
—— the man Geneva
Coach Dave Murray said
was t-he key to the
Panther attack — scored
with 5:02 remaining in
the second overtime yes-
terday to break a score-
less tie. This gave the
Panthers 21 1-0 victory
over the Golden
Tornadoes of Geneva
College at Pitt Stadium.

The win was the third
straight for the Panthers
(3-2) and lifted them over
the .500 mark for the first
time this year since start-
ing the season with a
pair of disappointing
one—goal defeats.

The victory also gives»

Pitt, in first place in the
Big East, a huge boost as

Heavenly defense to C&l7'7j/ Saints to top of NFC West

By George Klimis
Staff Writer

Aside from the National
Football Conference East,
the NFC West will be the
most competitive division
in the National Football
League. With the tenacious
defense of the New Orleans
Saints, the offensive potency
of the San Francisco 49ers
and the resurgence of the
Atlanta Falcons, the “Wild
West” will definitely see some
shootouts on the gridiron this
season.

Throughout the ‘80s,
the West was usually a battle
between California teams,
the 49ers and Rams. But
with the Saints rising to the
top in recent years, and
Jerry Glanville rebuilding

the Falcons, this year will

JOIN THE PANTHER
EQUESTRIAN TEAM!

Captains:

not be the usual cakewalk
for the 49ers, who won
four Super Bowls in the
‘80s. As for the Rams, they
have to clean house and
rebuild a team that was just
one game from the Super Bowl
in ‘89. V

If anything can hold back
the New Orleans Saints
from winning the West, it
will be the erratic arm of quar-
terback Bobby Hebert.
The Saints are relying on

him to stay healthy and consis-‘-*

tent. Hebert, when on, is
tough to beat. When Hebert
was out in 1990 with a contract
dispute, the Saints finished
8-8.

Last year, they finished 11-5.’

Second-string QB Steve Walsh

is also very talented, but he .

lacks the experience necessary
to lead the Saints.

Michelle Surma
682-2399

Julie Pechersky
682-709 1

At receiver, the Saints have
good depth. Even with Floyd
Turner out for the year, go-to-
man Eric Martin proved last
Sunday against Chicago he can
pick up the slack. Wesley
Carroll and Quinn Early will
also prove valuable to the
offense.

With proven back Craig
Heyward, the Saints will prove

_ to have a solid offensive attack.

The Saints also picked up
Vaughn Dunbar in the draft

-and will hope that Gill Fenerty

will be solid as a third-down
back.

But it will be the great Saints
defense that will lead them to
the Western Division title in
‘92. With a defense that ranks
right on the heels of the
Philadelphia Eagles — the
49ers and Falcons, among other
teams, will have a lot of prob-

lems scoring points.

The Saints’ linebacking corps
rates second to none in
the NFL. For the sixth
straight season, Rickey Jackson,
Pat Swilling, Sam Mills
and Vaughan Johnson will
roam the fields looking for vic-
tims to eat.

These guys are getting old,
so expect them to make a seri-
ous run for it all this year.

The San Francisco 49ers,
minus QB Joe Montana,
will still be in the hunt for the
West title and a shoe-in for the
playoffs. After finishing last sea-
son 10-6 and out of the play-
offs for the first time since
1982, the 49ers will storm
into "92 with the same energy
they ended with last year —
when they won their final six
games.

This year’s starting QB, Steve

13

Young, who was Montana’s
backup for years, proves week
in and out that he is one of the
top QBs in the business.

And if Young were to go
down, backup Steve Bono
proved last year he is more
than capable of running the
high—powered Frisco attack.

Jerry Rice, the best receiver
in the pros, and John Taylor
provide a one-two punch
no other team can boast.

Also, tight end Brent Jones
will be a popular target for

_Young as will fullback Tom"

Rathman swinging out of the
back field.

Sleek running back Ricky
Watters has proven to
be a pleasant surprise for the
49ers early this season, racking
up 185 yards ondjust 28 carries.

render a solid defensive

front, giving Scarlet
Knights’ head coach Doug
Graber three ingredients to
consistent pass rush: experi-
ence, talent and depth.

On the whole, the Scarlet
Knights’ defense is head-
and-shoulders better in all
facets of the game than the
undersized, unknown enti-
ties known as the Kent and
WVU defense.

Their overall talent —
combined with their pletho-
ra of multiple formations —
presents big problems for
the Panther offense, who
look to rebound from the
school’s worst loss in the
86-year history of the
“Backyard Brawl.” ’

“They are a complex
defense,” Hackett said.
“They play a number of dif-
ferent defenses  they play
man, they play zone, they

play bump-and-run.

“We’ve got ourselves a
tough opponent.”

One area of this “tough
opponent” that glows
with experienced talent
is the Scarlet Knights’
defensive backfield — led
by aforementioned free
safety Jackson. Cornerbacks
Jay Bellamy and Marshall
Roberts, a junior and

senior respectively who

started for Rutgers in ‘91,
present viable wideout
roadblocks for Pitt receivers
Bill Davis and Chris Bouyer.

Senior Doug Adkins, a 5-
foot—9-inch, 183-pound
strong safety, draws the
assignment of containing
Pitt tight end Rob Coons.

While Rutgers’ strength
lies on the defensive side of
the ball, Coach Graber has
yet to see his team play
anywhere close to its capa-
bility.

He cites the Scarlet
Knights’ opening day defeat
to Boston College, 37-20, as
proof that this team has its
better days ahead of them.

“We really struggled in
our opening game [against
Boston Collegel,”. Graber
said. “We seem to have
come together a little bit in
the past week. But we real-
ly have not played [defense]
consistently to this point.”

With the strengths of both

teams — the Rutgers’
defense and Panthers’
offense — having troubles

attaining,a consistent level
of play, tonight’s nationally
televised game will likely
come down to whichever
unit gets on track first. And
if last week’s results have
any influence or motivation
for this matchup, Williams
and company may follow
a shutout of Colgate [41-O]
with a stonewall of Pitt.

Geneva, but for two halves of
play and an entire session of
OT, the Panthers’ workhorse
efforts on the field failed to
show up where it mattered
most — the scoreboard.

Pitt controlled the game’s
ﬂow with attack after attack on
the Geneva defense, and for
the better part of the game, the
ball all but lived in the Golden
Tornadoes’ end of the field.
Despite countless opportunities
to get on the SC'U1€bO2ll'Cl, the
Panthers failed to score.

“We were over attacking,”
said Pitt Coach Joe Luxbacher.
“We had our chances. We kept
missing and missing.”

“I was frustrated, and I think
as a team we were frustrated
big time,” added Prex, the
sophomore midfielder from
Pittsburgh.

And the Panthers had good
reason to be frustrated. They
outshot the Golden Tornadoes
by an overwhelming margin,
24-4, and kept Geneva goalie
Greg Helsel busy for the entire

game forcing him to make 13
saves, some of them of the sen-
sational variety.

Helsel, who had 13 stitches
removed from his head before
the game so he could play,
came up big on a few occa-
sions for the Golden
Tornadoes.

He foiled Panther forward
Dean Astorino a couple of
times, first with just 2:48 to go
in regulation, and later three
minutes into the first overtime.

In Helsel’s first save, Astorino
raced in deep in the Geneva
zone, just ahead of the Golden
Tornado defense, and sent a
shot low on goal towards the
left post. Helsel looked beat
but at the last moment
punched away the ball with his
right hand.

The freshman goaltender’s
second save of an Astorino
shot —- three minutes into the
first overtime — was even
more sensational. This time,
Astorino sped in on the Geneva
net and blistered a shot that
sailed high above the Golden
Tornado defense. Helsel
looked like a goner but
reached high to the heavens
and swatted away the would-
be goal to preserve the tie.

Prex finally ended the
Panther frustration by picking
up a poorly-cleared ball near
midfield five minutes into the
second overtime, dribbling
right past a slew of defenders,
and moving right in on Helsel.
Prex went underneath the

sprawling netminder with his

shot to finally give the Panthers
the lead and ultimately the win.
' Geneva head coach Dave
Murray was full of praise for
his goalie’s gutsy performance
in defeat.

“Pitt had three goals that
lHelsell took out of the net,”
said Murray.

As for Prex’s performance,
Murray, aswell as Pitt Coach
Luxbacher, was equally gener-
ous with his praise. O

“Eric Prex is one of the best
attackers in the Big East,” said
Murray. “He has incredible
knowledge of how to play
position-play tactically.”

“Eric is a key man,” said
Luxbacher. “He not only scores
goals, he creates chances for
other people. They were cover-
ing him all night. Every time he
touched the ball there were
two guys right there. He means
a lot to our team, not just in
scoring goals but in leader-
ship.”

The Knights’ quarterback
dilemma has come as atotal
surprise. Big things had been
expected of junior Bryan
Fortay since his transfer from
Miami. Fortay was the talk of
the east entering the season
and may have been the victim
of unrealistic expectations
according to Graber.

“Before he even played a
down, some of the media here
had him favored for the

‘Heisman and that isn’t fair,”

Graber said.
“For a guy who's never
played before, they’ve asked a

great deal of him,” Pitt head.

coach Paul Hackett added.
Fortay (6—feet 3—inches, 205
pounds) is a good athlete with
a powerful arm. He narrowly
lost the starting job to _Gino
Torretta at Miami last season
and after expressing his d-is-

pleasure, transferred north. His.

credentials give plenty of rea-
son to expect All-A1nerican—
type numbers, but after an
ominous debut against Boston
College, Graber pulled Fortay
midway through the second
quarter last week against
Colgate.

Enter Ray ‘Lucas. The redshirt
freshman player came on to hit

his first five passes while lead-

ing Rutgers to scores on five of
six possessions. Rutgers
smashed Colgate 41-0. On his
first collegiate pass, Lucas hit
split end Jim

Guarantano for an eight—yard
touchdown. He finished the
day with seven completions in
11 attempts for 107 yards.
Fortay returned in the fourth
quarter and promptly marched

Rutgers 65 yards for a score.
Now Graber faces a decision
but said there is no controver-
sy.

*“Tl1e media thinks it’s a big
deal.‘ I don’t,” Graber said.

.“Fortay’s a fine athlete, he’s a

good player. He has struggled
through the first two games.
Lucas made a lot of mistakes,
but he made some plays.”

“I guess we're on the sched-
ule for every team that has a
quarterback controversy,”
Hackett quipped.

Fortay has hit just 26 of 53
passes for 257 yards and three
touchdowns, with three inter-
ceptions. Graber said he may
just play both quarterbacks,
depending on their perfor-
mance in practice this week.

“They’re both similar in that
they’re very good athletes,"
Graber said. "They can sprint
out and they can scramble.
They still have problems call-
ing audibles and reading
defenses.”

thing is for certain — he’ll_ be
throwing to Guarantano.
Guarantano currently ranks
second on Rutgers’ all—tin1e
receptions list with 113, need-

_ing just 15 catches to supplant

Andrew Baker at the top of the
list. Guarantano’s 1,438 career
yards are good enough for
third on the school’s all—time
yardage list. Last week he
pulled down a game-high five
receptions for 68 yards, giving
him two-game totals of 11
receptions for 128 yards.
“jimmy is just a fine player
for us,” Graber said. “He’s got
great hands. He's :1 heady guy
who finds the open spots.” ’

catching the ball out of
the backfield, with serious

 

I open-field moves.

, He, along with first-round
draft pick Amp Lee and
Rathinan, will try to revitalize
a running game that has been
gone since Roger Craig left in
‘90.

The 49ers defense is not
nearly as dominant as it.was
in the days of Charles Haley

and Ronnie Lott. Since both‘

players moved on to other
teams, the 49ers will need
OLB Tim Harris and OLB
Bill Romanowski to have big
seasons.

Another hope is that DE
Piece Holt, at 6—feet 4-inches,

280 pounds, will be the

rock on the 49ers defensive
line.

The Atlanta Falcons are a
tough team to figure out. It
seems that their big—play spe-
cial teams bail out their lack-
luster defense week after
week. However, Glanville has
his team on the right track. If
the cards fall into place for the
Falcons, you can count on
them to stick around for the
postseason. ‘

QB» Chris Miller seems to
improve every season, and his
leadership qualities on the field
are what .keep the Falcons an
above .500 team. With WRs
Andre Rison and Mike Haynes
at the receiving end, Miller will

continue to put up great num-

bers.

But with the lack of a run-
ning game, and an often invisi-
ble defense, Miller is some-
times playing catch up, and it’s
tough to win when you’re con-
stantly behind.

Deion Sanders is the corner-
stone of the Falcons defense.
Other than Tim Mckyer and
Sanders at the corners, the
Falcons lack talent at both
safety positions. Scott Case is a
big hitter, but lacks speed and
coverage skills. They severely
miss strong safety Brian Jordan,
a Pro Bowl alternate last sea-
son,’ who left the team to play
baseball. Thisbasically allows
teams to pass at will against
Atlanta.

But whenever you watch
Atlanta, you always have to

THE PITI‘ NEWSiThu1-sday, September 17, 1992

keep an eye on Sanders. His
quick feet and pure speed
make him the deadliest punt-
and-kickoff returner in the
league.

The bad thing for the Los
Angeles Rams is that they’re
in a deep hole. The good
news is that they are trying to
do something about it.

Three years ago, QB Jim
Everett and WRS Henry Ellard
and Flipper Anderson were
upsetting the Philadelphia
Eagles and New York Giants in
the playoffs, only to be
stopped by the eventual World
Champion 49ers in the NFC
Title game.

The Rams re-hired Chuck
Knox to rebuild their team
and to do it fast. Knox has

something to work with in
Everett, Ellard, Anderson and
first-round pick DE Sean
Gilbert.

The depleted defense is what
the Rams should try to heal
first, and they took big steps by
drafting Gilbert and speedy
CB/special teams player Steve
Israel.

However, don’t expect to
see much from the Rams
this season. Whatever veterans
are left on that team will need
a lot more than a new coach to
get their morale back up again.
What the Rams will need is

more young players, and not a ’

quick fix.
But if anything is certain this
year, you can count on the

Rams to bring up the rear.

You can rely on Kaplan LSAT prep.
The Roman Numerals question format, sometimes
called Triple True/ False, has not appeared on the
LSAT since February 1991. Kaplan caught the
change. Not by accident, but because we have a
team of professionals dedicated to analyzing the
LSAT. Kaplan updated all lectures, materials
and sample tests. So you'll spend every minute
and every dollar getting ready for the test you'll

actually take.

Sides of the court, but Pitt
rallied around their
All—Americztn hopeful, Lttcanie,
to take 21 12-10 lcztd. I

The Panthers again got great
performances from Gustafson
and Hemingway.

Both Spiked well (15 kills for
Gttstztfson and 8 kills for
Hemingway) and blocked
the Dukes better than in game
one. I .

With Dttquesnc attacking Pitt
well from the middle, both
teztms traded punches with Pitt
gaining 21 14-12 lcztd. But that
lead C\’21pOt‘21[CCl as the Dukes
fought back to stagger the
Patnthers in 21 17-15 come—from—
behind victory. .

“Duquesne is 21 very scrappy
team,” Woodstra said. “They
dug SO111€ balls we thought they
cOuldn’t get.”

While Duquesne’s middle-
round blows might have stag-
gered the Panthers, it cettztinly
did not knock them out. Pitt
bounced off the ropes and came
back in ‘.1 hurry. I

Unlike gziI11CS one and two,
it was Pitt that darted out to
an early lead scoring the
g;tttte’s first nine points. Helped
by plenty of Service errors,

In fztct, they crumbled and the

Pztnthers went on to win easily
15-2.

Game four followed suit, and
again the Panthers quickly
jumped out to 21 4-0 lead.
Dttqucsne continued to make
mistakes and Pitt capitalized on
them, lengthening its lead to 10-
1. .
First—year player Alyssa Yztnik
paced the Offense while Mil<l:t’s
Serve kept Duqucsnc on its
toes.

The Dukes gztnte plan finally
fell to pieces and the rout was
on. Winning 15-1, the Panthers
showed Dttquesne who was still
the team to beat.

“They let down,” Woodstra
said of Duquesne’S misfortunes
in games three and four. “We

fought back and that was the -

difference.” b

With this win, Pitt raised its

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September 17, 1992

Live!-

Continued from page S-1
an imposing Fulton Theater event fea-
turing pianist Vladimir Feltsman and a
host of comrades from Australia and
China.

Tonight, Elliot Sharp, a performer and
composer who has been linked to the
experimental “Downtown New York”
scene, based around clubs like the
Knitting Factory, blasts off night No. 2
of this impressive fest. Sharp has played
with numerous area musicians such as
percussionist Samm Bennett and saxo-
phonist Ned Rothenberg as well as
appearing with post—jazz group The
President. In addition to these, he
recorded the album Bootstrappers with
Mike Watt and George Hurley of FIRE-
HOSE. "

Last October Sharp performed a solo
set at the Rosebud (Over The Edge Ifs
finale); just him and his doublenecked
guitar/bass, with a bit of bass clarinet
thrown in for good measure. It was
pretty jarring at times, and one wonders
what the stuffed—shirt clientele at the
club/restaurantwere thinking as he
twisted out demented skronks and
honks from hisginstruments. But you
couldn’t deny the power of it. Not
everyone can do a solo performance
and keep it interesting 'thr,,oughout the
whole set. Sharp did. ‘ »

Tonight Sharp returns to the Rosebud,
accompanied by his group Carbon.
Along with Sharp, the group includes
-Zeena Parkins on electric harp (that's
right, the kind Harpo played). Parkins is
no stranger to local audiences having

p‘erformed with No Safety in Over the
Edge and with the Jim Staley Group last .

fall in Over The Edge 11. Bassist_Mark
‘Sloan, drummer Joseph Trump and

sampler David Weinstein(of Odd Job)
make up this dense and often intimidat-
ing quintet which is often accented by
Sharp’s harsh, electric explosions.
Friday’s showcase is just as powerful,

 

highlighting the outstanding talents of 

veteran guitarist Marc Ribot and his lat— I

est project, the trio Old Baby. It’s inter-

esting writing about “downtown/” 5

groups like this, because of their con-
stant changing lineups and few record-

ings together. In the past, Ribot has 
played with some other worlcl—class jazz 
artists. His seemingly frantic, yet con— 
trolled pluckings weaved in and out of 
The Lounge Lizard’s expressive “fake 
jazz” mercifully, while his work tooka 

more subdued-tone with Tom Waits,
whom he recorded with on three
albums. _
Newark, New Jersey—born Ribot has
even dabbled into more mainstream cir-

cles, working with Elvis Costello and .0

even (gasp!) David Sanborn. The Jazz
Passengers, a semi-offshoot of the
Lounge Lizards, might be his most
ambitious recording, at least until last
year, when he released his solo effort,
Rootless Cosn-zopolitans, an LP that
funked up “The Wind Cries Mary” and
even dabbled in noisy bursts of schizo-
phrenic rock that is normally reserved
for independent musicians with a cater-
ing for feedback. Originally, Sun Ra and
his Arkestra was scheduled to appear,
but Ribot is an impeccable choice as a
replacement.

Meanwhile, but in a similar vein (or in
this case string), Sonny Sharrock has
been described as “the undisputed origi-
nator of the free jazz guitar.” But his
music can’t be pigeonholed as just free
jazz. ,

Hail his six strings: Marc Ribot

After discovering the music of John
Coltrane, Sharrock tried to pick up the
saxophone. Asthma prevented him from
pursuing it, but he says that he strives
for the sound of a horn in his playing.

His approach became strengthened
when he heard a Miles Davis recording
in 1966. “They were playing an
extremely fast version of ‘Milestones,’
and I was playing straight-ahead lines,”
Sharrock said. “And it wasn’t enough,
there wasn’t any feeling. Well, when I
reached for the feeling, it started to
sound like what I sound like now, and I
said, ‘Whoa, man, there’s something
here!’’’ i

From the late ‘60s into the next Story by Milee Shanley and Brian

decade, Sharrock recorded with a wide

 '  variety of jazz musicians, from the

avant-garde wailings of saxophonist
Pharoah Sanders to the straight-ahead
flute playing of Herbie Mann.

Nineteen ninety-one saw no less than
three releases by Sharrock, each in a
different setting. The highly praised Ask‘
The Ages reunited him with Pharoah
Sanders, along with drummer Elvin
Jones and bassist Charnett Moffett, they
played music inspired by the spirit of
John Coltrane. Faith Moves featured
Sharrock in collaboration with Nicky
Skopelitis, who plays guitar and half a
dozen other stringed instruments. With
up to 10 overdubs on some songs, the
music is dense and hypnotic.

. Highlzfe featured the new lineup of
the Sonny Sharrock Band, which
includes two drummers, electric bass
and keyboards as well as Mr. S. The

» group draws it styles from roots rock

and roll, electric blues and free jazz.

 This will be the band Sharrock brings to

town for the grand finale of Music Lives!
There’s no better way to cap off this
extravaganza.

Music Lives! and so should you. Come
out and experience what once would be
shocletng to this town, but thanlefully has
become more regular. A healthy dose of
Maalox for the mind, Elliot Shatp and

Adam ’sRz'b.- Family strength, Soviet style on the big screen

By Brian Berger

Showcase Editor

Maybe they do know how to laugh in
the Soviet Union. At least that’s the feel-
ing that Ul<ranian—born director
Vyacheslav Krishtofovich portrays in
Adam's Rib, a deliciously perceptive
slice of life from Soviet society.

The gripping plot revolves around a
family of four females who share
cramped living quarters and rubles.

rm NEWS, Thursday; S'e'pt“e'ii1b'ér‘ I-r;*1992* 0

While Krishtofovich takes jabs at
addressing the economic hardships the
family endures, he combines it with
lightly sprinkled humor that urges on
the highly spirited storyline.

At thefilm’s core is Nina (Inna
Churikova),.a_ mother of two very differ-
ent daughters: Lida (Sveltana Ryabova)
is more beauty than brains while Nastya
(Maria Golbkina) comes across as the
young rebel with an intense streak. All
three are deeply committed to helping

their paralyzed, bed-ridden grandma
(Elana Bogdanova) despite their con-
stant quarreling over who should clean
out her bed pan.

While Nina does her best to keep her
apartment and family in line, she strug-
gles with an underlying question of
love. After two husbands and an aging
demeanor, she is tempted by,Evgeny
(Andrei Tolubeyev), a shy and sincere
soul who knows nothing but his work
as a factory boss. In a convincing scene

sir

that speaks as much about communism
as‘it does about the pairs growing rela-
tionship, he explains in a humbled tone
how his job is a constant battle of com-
munication. As the two eat and glance
curiously across the table, Nina asks in
astonishment if he “yells.” Honestly, he
answers, “No, I get yelled at.” It is dia-
logue like this, which points to the
communist working ladder and her
devout sympathy for him, which pushes

In 1 1th hour, Youn

Anyone who thinks that
Shakespeare is for the intellec-
tt al set only should see the
Y Jung Company’s current ver-

bs:-.)n of Twelfth Night. This clas-

sic comedy of mistaken identity
and misplaced love blends
slapstick comedy with intelli-
gent farce to create a delightful
evening of theater.
Shakespeare’s play takes
place in the land of Illyria —-— a
fantasy country peopled by
noble dukes and clownish ser-
vants. Director David Skeele
has set his production rather
loosely “in British-Occupied
Cairo of 1918, during World
War I. The ensembleof rich,

Britisli nobles playing at sultan,

British Army Officers playing at

v war and native Arab servants

playing for laughs blends with
the exotic setting to create an
incredibly seamless world for
the drama to take place.

' Skeele’s romanticized version

of Old Cairo is as lush and
exotic as incense, as intricate
and fantastic as the sitar and

’ drum music which underscores
the show. To watch this pro-

duction, one would almost

* believe that the Middle Eastern

setting was part of
Shakespeare’s original vision.

Skeele’s Tzuelftb Nigbt hovers
between lyrical romanticism

and frenetic comedy with a

subplot involving a series of

mistaken loves among‘ the offi-

cers and servants. Subtle wit

and poetry mix with clownish
foolery to merge into a spectac-
ular show. But Skeele’s produc-
tion is not all light. He explores
the dark underside of comedy

— the fine lines between
humor and cruelty — to great
effect in Act II. This is not all
mindless entertainment but
sometimes an intelligent come-
dy of human emotions.

Part of this show.’s sparkle

 

THE PITT NEWS,

comes from truly excellent
design elements. Ron Slanina
creates a gorgeous set with
Arabic flair:-using sand, bits
of mirror and deep, rich colors
throughout his designs. Leslie
Kennedy’s costumes also add
to the desert illusion, with
a nice mix of British and
Arabic clothing. A hypnotic
sitar score by Christine Frezza
adds a subtle magic which
completely transports the audi-
ence to the exotic land ‘of
Cairo/Illyria.»

But the real strength of this
show comes from its actors,
who bring this fantasy world to
life with energy and vigor.
They use an over—the-top phys-
ical comedy style which suc-

cessfully treads the fine line

between hilarity and overkill.
This difficult balance is handled
with real polish — from chase
scenes and drunken duels to
pratfalls and double—takes. The
play is filled with the sexual
innuendo and play upon words

for which Shakespeare is -

famous, ranging from the ele-
gantly oblique to the wittily

' earth . This versatile cast han-
. ,Y

dles it all -with the natural grace
of seasoned actors. ’
Sir Toby Belch (D. E. Jukes),

Maria (Barbie Williams) and

their collection of drunken
friends (Kevin McDonald and
Robert}. Masterson) are shining
examples of this smoothly-
done physical comedy. They

play off each other effortlessly,

revives Twelfth Night

providing some ofthe funniest
moments in the play.

The unfortunate object of
their jokes is usually the
straight-laced Malvolio (David
Hadingcr). Hadinger steals the
show as the comedy’s
pompous straight man. His
eyes literally appear to be pop-

ping out of his head at times I

with self-righteous indignation
at the antics of Jukes and com-
pany. His performance is nearly
matched by David White, who
excels in the role of Feste, a
fool. His comic delivery, timing
and facial expressions are all
perfect. As the fool, White ties
the rest of the cast together,
playing to all sides of the twist-
ed plot of mistaken identities.
As well, his graceful singing
and dancing are among the
most striking things in this pro-
duction.

Also memorable is Michele
DiMaso, as Viola. DiMaso turns
in a virtuoso performance as a
young woman masquerading as
a boy servant, who then falls in
love with her. master. She
blends the comedy of her_situa-
tion (watch for her first
encounters with a pipe) with a
keen sensitivity and romance.
She is one of the best elements
of a show filled with good
things, giving a thoroughly
enjoyable portrayal. The object
of her attentions, Duke Orsino
(Ron Richards) plays his role
with gentlemanly flair.

the unpredictable narrative
along.

This is much of what
Krishtofovich plugs into his
dialogue, and he does it in

simple terms. And the charac— L

ters deliver with concrete
performances that hold the
plot firmly in its female
place. In the film’s inspiring
finale, the ladies throw a
birthday party for Grandma.
The “family” guests include-,
Evgeny and the daughters
fathers: the intellectual Sasha
and the bourgeois Victor.
Krishtofovich brilliantly cap-
tures the men’s hesitancy
toward each other — Sasha,
a Jew, turns to Victor and
pronounces his last name as
“Goldberg, any problems?,”

\

pointing hilariously to the
communist’s long—exposed
anti—semitism. But, the thrust
of the dinner and the plot is
the topic of Nastya’s unex-
pected news of pregnancy.
Despite her blooming age of
15, she is determined to keep
the baby, much to the irnme—
diate dismay of Victor and

‘ Nina. Her father (Sasha) is

more sympathetic‘ and prods
her as to which gender she
prefers. .- .
While the film is Soviet, its
themes are clearly universal
and particularly American.
The abortion issue, the
thought, is addressed
(although it is treated with
horror) and demanded ironi-
cally by Victor who asks Lida,
the group’s most attractive

and sexual character, that she
must know someone who
cando it. But, a family that .
stays together grows strong"
together, and that is this
group’s main attribute. It is a
formula that works very well
in Hollywood’s cushy world..
Almost all the significant
scenes are related to the fam-
ilies interaction: the swimsuit
scene in which Lida shows
herself as a looker, Nastya
proves herself as hip enough
to know about bikini’s and
the black market, and Nina
as someone out of touch, but
in touch enough to try it on,
and even learn from, her
girls.

Krishtofovich filters in the
right blend of sarcasm on

band. In addition to providing
foundation, Marcinko’s playing
is so melodic that it almost
takes on the role of a second
guitarist without getting in the
way of the rest of the band.
The songs on the electric disc
have been part of the band’s
live set for several years. A few
even appeared on previous
cassettes they released. The
performances here are some of
the best the band has recorded.
They recreate the energy and
enthusiasm that is part of their
live shows, which was lacking
on some previous studio
recordings. ~
Marcinko’s “Lab Rat” is a
great funky workout with a
break that shifts in and out of
double—time. Kip puts in two
vocal performances, one of
which, “Overflow,” is the clos-
est that band has cometo
approximating the Minutemen.
Tenor and alto saxophones
give three of the songs greater
dimension with the way they’re
arranged. “Gou—Pina” sounds
bluesy as a result, and Steve
Heineman provides a great,
noisy alto solo on “\X’alrus

Attack.”

Unfortunately, the disc suf-

. fers from some lackluster mix-

ing. Knauer’s guitar gets buried
too_ "often, especially when the
horns come in. Four songs
appeared on the band’s
Armad-z'll0 Serenade tape two
years ago, and in some cases,

the new versions don’t add
much to the originals.’ Fans of
live ATS shows might enjoy
hearing the vocals out front
for a change, but you need to
hear Evan’s axework loud to
really get the full effect of the
band.

The acoustic disc might actu-
ally be the more interesting of
the two because it shows the
depth of the band. Instead of

just re—recording some of their‘

electric songs acoustically
(including three from the other
disc), a lot of the songs sound
like the group put a lot of
thought into doing different
arrangements, occasionally
adding instruments like upright
bass and the slit drum.

The most impressive moment
comes in “The Divorce Song,”
which is done completely a
cappella by all three members

and manager ‘Kevin Forsythe.
' They turn in a pretty rousing

performance of it and their ver-
sion of Flatt and Scruggs’ “T he
Good Things Outweigh the
Bad," where the instruments
drop out for one verse. A

- In Knauer’s ‘.‘Another Guy On
Parole” he takes every country
music lyric cliche and comes
up with a brilliant parody.

Marcinko’s songs, like “Dusty,

Roads” and “Camouflage,” have
haunting lyrics which get
increased emphasis in this set-

‘ting.

Continued from page S-3

a lavishly brazen effort dealing with
man’s excesses. Greenaway doesn’t give
his plots underbelly away, instead he
hides and marinates his films with sym-
bolic representations which at a time
become overbearing but are always
satiric in base. Occasionally he tends to
be quite savage in his expressions of
surplus and excess in what he terms his
“deliberately artificial and always self-
reflexive” works. Metaphors seem to be
his cue and he takes an intense stance
against Hollywood and its beliefs.

“The only decent metaphorical film-
maker you have here is David Lynch
(Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks). Americans
don’t understand what metaphor in cin-
ema is all about,” he recently said in an
interview with critic Gavin Smith. Take
him up on it and see if you can under-
stand Greenaway’s vague vocabulary,
the rewards he offers are almost always
startling.

Meanwhile, Canuck ‘Cronenburg
(Saturday night’s main attraction) has
made a living out of his unwielding pas-
sion for the decomposing. Originally a
horror/Sci-Fi Filmer (which he delicately
balanced his efforts between), he has
recently become (and tackled) more

experimental bodies such as Naked

"Lunch, which he seemed to pull off

with the utmost ease. Despite its label-
ing as an unfilmable novel (from
William Burrough’s bizarre collection),
Cronenburg managed to capture the
novel’s dire intentions, but he did so in
a way that varied significantly from the
novel’s eccentric base, conveying broad,
hidden meanings with relentless force.
His earlier works include the grue-
some Rabid, starring Marilyn Chambers
as a blood-sucking. parasite and The
Brood, an emotional wrencher about a
mental patient. His better-known efforts
include the visually stunning
Videodrome, his outstanding adaptation
of Stephen King’s Yhe Dead Zone, and
of course, his re-working of The Fly.
Cronenburg draws his film’s strength
from forcing the viewer toihide his/her
eyes in disgust as he holds on long
scenes of decomposition,‘ scars and
mutations and things normally left for
the operating room. But Cronenburg
slices in broader representations and
feeds on the horror. Addiction is often a
universal theme in his works, Dead
Ringers with its portrayal of twin rela-
tionships and everything from Bug
Powder to mugwump in Naked Lunch.

. The director's

works will be shown on Saturday evenings at The Carnegie.

Cronenburg, like Greenaway, enjoys
a ﬁlm’s shock value as pure metaphor.
Both directors intimidate the audience
with their personal stamp all over their
works, which are provocative, social
satires meshed among outrageous, but
gripping illustrations.
Expand your mind at the Carnegie

Museum as the Film And Video depart-
ment presents a quasi—festival of the
works of Peter Greenaway and David
Cronenburg. Each Friday a different
work from Greenaway will he screened
while Cronenburgis efforts will be shown

on Saturdays. For a schedule of events ,

“Being friends with your local

after producing a Tongue for
