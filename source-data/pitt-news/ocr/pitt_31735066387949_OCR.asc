Oakland businesses not affected by recession

By Tonia Caruso
Stajf Writer

In spite of the nation’s slowing
economy, business in Oakland
remains strong, according to local
merchants.

“Our business hasn’t been
affected by the recession at all. In
fact, business is good,” said Brad
Adams, manager of The Pro
Image, a newly opened sports-

apparel shop located on Forbes
Avenue. Adams said that students
make up 60 to 65 percent of the
store’s customers.

‘‘I think we’ve been successful
because we’re new and very
modern looking. People just keep
coming in,” said Adams. “The
recession hasn’t slowed anything
in our store. We’re selling
something that the students and
people want ,

and that’s the bottom line.”

Carl Barbarino, manager of The
Athlete’s Foot, said the students’
return to Pitt after the holidays
has boosted sales by about $2,000
a week.

“We’re more or less a seasonal

store. We’re only busy when the K"

kids are in school,” he said. “I
don’t think we’ll be affected by
the recession because no matter
what, the students are always in

here buying something.”

Students agreed that their
spending habits haven’t changed
as a result of the recession.

“I haven’t been spending less ,
partly because the things that I
purchase haven’t really gone up
in price,” senior Stacey Locke
said. “I’m not in the market for a
car or any large purchase that
would make a big dent in my
pocket.”

Locke, who spends most of her
money on clothes and items for
school, said she doesn’t think the
recession has fully hit Pittsburgh.

“I would definitely cut back if
the recession would become bad.
But for now, I’m spending about
the same as I always have,” Locke
said.

Junior Kristin Bordenkircher
said she hasn’t been conscious of

Sheen comes
to aid local

Throughout his two—day visit
to Pittsburgh, actor and activist
Martin Sheen encouraged people
to pray and find the “humanity”
inside themselves to end the
Persian Gulf Crisis and bring
peace to the world.

Sheen, who said prayer will
stop the war more quickly than
“yelling and screaming," also
came to Pittsburgh to get Sheriff
Eugene Coon to drop assault
charges against local activist
Vincent Eirene. Eirene claims he
was accused of assaulting Officer
Ieo Campbell, when in fact Eirene
was assaulted by Officer Richard
Stewart.

“If you go in yelling and

. screaming, you’re no different
than the people already there,”
Sheen said. “Go to the places of
darkness. Kneel and pray and
bring your own humanity in

there.”

King honored
by local church

By Tammy R. Poole
Staff Writer

In a tribute to civil-rights leader Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., a local church gathered at
Benedum Hall last night to continue King's
“dream.”

‘Dr. King was ‘a man that had a spiritual insight
that reached all mankind, not just certain ethnic
backgrounds. If we let that light go out, then
we're part of the problem and not the resolution,”
said Sister Shirley Brooks, administrative assistant
to the director of the Allegheny African Methodist
and Episcopal Zion Conference Ministerial
Alliance, the church which sponsored the'event.

For the eighth consecutive year King was
honored by the church with choir selections
from AME’s Trinity, St. Mark and St. Paul’s choirs.
The Conference Choir, directed by James White
and his accompanist, Francis Samuels, also
contributed selections to the ceremony. Excerpts
were recited from Dr. King’s speeches, “The
Drum Major Instinct,” “I’ve Been to the Mountain
Top” and “I Have a Dream.”

Lyrics of the black national anthem’s “Lift
Every Voice and Sing” were shouted by members
of the congregation as they rose to_their feet
during the opening ceremonies.

“T oday’s program should serve as an additional
part in his vision. [King] gave us his part. The

Pittsburgh Students Against the War is
planning several pro-peace activities for
today and tomorrow, according to PSAW
member Jill Castek. She said the slogan of
these activities will be, “Stop the war
before it starts.”

“We want to make a statement to say
that students in Pittsburgh are against
offensive military action,” Castek said.

According to Castek, the activities will
center around a “peace camp,” in which
tents will be set up on the William Pitt
Union lawn at 9 a.m. Monday.

At 10 a.m., freshman Scott Lowery,
another member of PSAW, will read a
speech he wrote to officially start off the
peace camp.

Moments of silence will be held on
Monday at 4 p.m. and later at midnight to

StAR resumes activity with ﬁlm on racial issues

By Renee Crespy
Staﬁ’ Writer

After a semester of inactivity, a
reorganized Students Against
Racism will start the new year by
showing a Spike Lee movie to
draw attention to racial issues on

campus.

“We haven’t done anything
public because the group was
busy trying to reorganize itself,
so the past semester we haven’t

really had time. This is our first
public event this year, and we’re
starting off small but plan to have
other activities,” said Chris
Moleski, president of StAR.

StAR will be showing Do the

Right Thing on Jan.16, at 8:30
p.m. in the William Pitt Union
Assembly Room.

“It’s been a very popular movie
dealing with important issues,”
said Moleski. “After the movie

we’re going to have an open

mike so people can ask questions
and give opinions.”

StAR Vice President Matt Sipple
said that the group chose Do The
Right Thing because of its
powerful message.

“There are two good quotes at
the end of the movie. One is by
Malcolm X, and the other is by
Dr. Martin Luther Kingjr. They're
both about leadership and
discrimination, and that should
bring, up a lot of good

discrimination topics, ” said Sipple.

StAR, which was started last
January, has been trying to Start
organizations on other campuses.

“The main reason why we got
StAR together was because we
saw a lot of separation on campus,
such as [Black Action Society]
and the [Campus Women’S
Organization], and we wanted to
start an organization that all
groups could join and be a part
of, “ said Moleski.

The group on relationships
focuses on students who are
currently involved in a
relationship of any type.

“We stress that it can be any
relationship that is signiﬁcant and
important to that person,” she
said. “The group is not designed
just for couples. It's designed for
those who have a relationship
that they want to ..develop and

The other groups focus on

women’s concerns, dissertation
writing, the problems students of
non-traditional age may
encounter when re—entering
college. There is also a career
group for creative and
unconventional people.

Eikleberry said the groups are
quite beneficial because the
sessions give students the chance

Prayers for Peace

Jason illings/The Pitt N ws

Story continued from page 1

Last Friday morning, Sheen put his words
into practice.

Sheen took part in an anti-war protest at
Carnegie Mel1on’s Software Engineering
Institute that consisted of people_ making

, a circle and praying for peace.

At SE1, John Dupre, a homeless Vietnam

veteran, greeted Sheen. Dupre introduced

1 himself and shook Sheen’s hand. Sheen
~ welcomed him, and together they prayed

to stop the war in Iraq. Dupre spent four
years in Vietnam and 15 months in a
prison camp.

“What’s going on in the gulf is
unfortunately a reﬂection of all the
confusion and pain that we have inside of
us,” Sheen said at the protest. “We have to
take responsibility for what’s going on.
Every citizen who pays taxes has
contributed to the war machine, and now
we’re stuck. We have to reverse that
process. We have to call into question our

Jason Billings/The Pitt News

rights as human beings  and I think we
all have that right —— to live peacefully, we
as Americans with our Constitution.”

After th protest at SE1, Sheen traveled
with Eirene to the Jubilee Kitchen. Sheen
introduced himself to guests who were
there for breakfast, and he shook hands,
offered hugs and signed autographs for
those who asked for them. He ended his
visit with a Bible reading of Leviticus 25,
which talks of helping the poor.

From the kitchen, Sheen and Eirene left
for Coon’s office. Here, Sheen planned to
give Coon a letter asking him to drop
assault charges against Eirene. Eirene was
charged on May 4 and is facing trial onjan.
29, 1991.

In the letter, Sheen said, “... the very
thought of Vincent Eirene engaged in an
assault on anyone for any reason is an
absurd contradiction. As the founder of
The Catholic Worker in Pittsburgh, Mr.
Eirene, like Gandhi, is one of those
extraordinary souls who place human life,
human rights and human dignity above all
else, even at the risk of his own life.”

Lieutenant McManara received the letter
privately in his own office in Coon’s
absence. According to Sheen, McManara
was very “cordial” and assured Sheen that
Coon would see the letter.

When asked why a Hollywood celebrity,
would speak out against the war, Sheen
said, “I love my country well enough to tell
it the truth. [The government doesn’tl
always want to hear that they are engaged
in premeditated murder. But you have to
love your country enough to say those
kinds of things and to try to awaken some
traces of humanity in these places of great
darkness and these times of great anxiety.
I cannot do this and be myself.”

Vince Eirene (left) and actor
Martin Sheen begin the day by
soul-searching in St. Paul's
Cathedral (top). The two say a

Barry York will never forget his
graduate education at Purdue
University three years ago.
Halfway through his second year,
he learned that teaching math
was not his lifelong ambition.
Although he continued pursuing
a master's degree, he was
determined to dedicate some time
to ﬁnding a more gratifying career.

So York began studying the
Bible. Within 10 months a career
in ministry seemed more
appealing, and he began to spend
much of his time at a church near
the campus where he taught other

students about Christianity and
how to succeed in college.

The ultimate decision to change
professions was inﬂuenced by a
pastor he met while attending
that same church.

“I saw the way he related the
Bible to the people, and.I knew
I wanted to do the same thing,”
said 27-year-old York, a part-
time Pitt instructor.

After graduating from Purdue
in 1987 he decided to spend the
next year at a seminary. With the
help of his pastor friend he
discovered the Reformed
Presbyterian Theology Seminary
of Pittsburgh, the fifth—oldest
seminary in the country, founded

in 1810.

When York moved to
Pittsburgh two years ago with
Miriam, his wife of five years, the
seminary helped him settle into
an apartment in Wilkinsburg.
Pleased with his new home and
excited to be in a large town, he
began looking for a part-time
teaching job.

“Going to a new city Where I
didn’t know anybody was very
scary and a big deal to me,” he
said, stretching his long arms
behind his head. “But I was
confident that I made the right
decision.”

The University of Pittsburgh

experience at Purdue, the
University of Pittsburgh offered
him a job teaching a pre—busir1€SS

Teaching at Pitt has allowed
York to spend some of his
afternoons interacting with
students at the university, while
the remainder of his time is
devoted Bible study and taking
morninhg classes at the seminary.

Located 10 minutes away from
York’s apartment, the seminary is
teaching York the pastoral skills
he hopes to use at a church he
plans to establish in Indiana after
he graduates in June.

“I am very excited about moving
to Indiana, and I look at starting
a new church as a step of faith,”
said York.

At the seminary he is learning
Hebrew and Greek to help him
decipher the original text of the
Old and New Testaments. He has
also studied the origins of the
church and the Christian
philosophy. One of his
assignments was to prepare a 50-
page essay, which required many

hours of research, on a Biblical.

passage.

His professors are pleased with
his writing and performance at
the seminary.

“Barry preaches very clearly
and sets forth his message in a
well—spoken language,” saidjohn
Stewart, Ph.D., president of the
seminary and a teacher of
Christian education. “His manner
is not forceful, and he is very
articulate.”

Stewart expects York to have

secretary for the math department,
said.

Webster describes York as p. .

For York, relating to over 100
students in his math class involves
patience.

“He seems to want to help the

“His overall style of teaching is

at an installation ceremony held
Thursday evening in the William

“We’ve come a long way as a

“My spending habits haven't:

been putting off any purchases
that I've wanted to make,” ‘
Bordenkircher said. “I don’t think
the recession has really affected
any of us on campus. We're kind
of in our own little world.‘

This “campus world” is pleasing
Oakland store managers. Bill

Turley, manager of Payless
Shoesource, said that althotlgh
sales are a little slow, his store is
doing well.

— “I don’t think our business will
be affected by the recession.
We’ve been up 10 percent over
last year’s ﬁgures,” he said. “The
majority of our business comes
from students who somehow
generally have money no matter
what.”

However, not all Pitt students
are spending freely these days.
Freshman Jonathan Toto said he
has been more cautious with his
money lately.

“My spending habits have
changed recently because it’s the
second semester and I'm running
out of money,” he said. “It doesn’t
really have much to do with the
recession. It's more of just my
personal situation."

apples. He insisted she avoid using a calculator to
solve simple multiplication. When the girl still
struggled with the probability of drawing playing
cards, he asked her to tear a sheet of paper into
pieces. He showed her how to solve the problem,
using the pieces of paper to represent the cards.

“I have a concern for people, and I hope it shows
up in class,” York said after the student left. "The
philosophy of teaching in a university is in error

because they don’t acknowledge God, and they
don’t devote any individual attention to the student.”
Sometimes he devotes class time to comparing
math to the Bible, which causes some students to
put down their pencils and pay closer attention.

“Every once in a while, he tends to preach about
one thing or another, and I don’t think it hinders the
class," said Yurkovich. “I get the feeling he is more
compassionate and understanding than other
teachers because he is in a seminary.”

Strengthening I/aeforce. ..

U.N. Resolution 678, which was passed in November,
allows for nations to use “all means necessary” to force
Iraq to leave Kuwait after Jan. 15. On Jan. 12, 1991, with
the closest vote of its «kind in U.S. history, Congress placed
a heavier punch behind that resolution. ,

By votes of 250-183, and 52-47,. the House of
Representatives and Senate, respectively, voted to give
President Bush authorization to use “all means necessary”
to force Saddam Hussein to give up his stranglehold on
Kuwait. With the Jan. 15 deadline approaching, President
Bush now has the bargaining chip he needed.

-Alternate bills in both houses were rejected by identical
numbers. These bills, offered by Senate MajorityLeader
George Mitchell, Senate Armed Services Committee
Chairperson Sam Nunn and House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, would have allowed more time for U.N.
sanctions to work.

However, had Congress passed these resolutions,
President Bush would have found himself in a bind. The
Jan. 15 deadline would have meant little to Hussein.
Without authorization from Congress, Bush would have
been powerless to enforce it.

With this authorization, Bush can now negotiate with
Hussein from a position of strength. Iraq can still withdraw
peacefully from Kuwait, with no action taken against it.
This resolution gives Bush the authority to invade Kuwait,
should no apparent withdrawal take place.

Many of our soldiers currently in Saudi Arabia claim that
they want to do something so that they can get home more
quickly, rather than train and drill in the desert. Congress,
with this bill, paves the way for something to be done.

This resolution, however, is not necessarily a declaration
of war, as many opposing legislators claimed. It is merely
the base for a threat: If Hussein does not leave Kuwait,
then force can and will be used against him by the United
States. J

U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar tried to
negotiate with Hussein. U.S. Secretary of State James
Baker tried to negotiate with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz. Both met with failure and a stubborn country
unwilling to compromise. Now maybe Iraq will see the
forces that are against it and back down.

Congress does not want war. The ultimate goal for this
bill is peace. According to Bush, “Peace is everyone’s
goal. Peace is in everyone’s prayers. But it is for Iraq to
decide.” With this resolution, President Bush now has the
negotiating tools to give Iraq some help in making that
decision. '

I saw something that really
disturbed me in The Pz'ttNews on
Jan. 9, 1991. It was a letter to the
editor, written by Thomas Daniels.
Now, Mr. Daniels is either avery
uninformed or a very
manipulative person. I feel the
need to comment.

He painted a picture of Israel
making the United States “do
their dirty work for them” in
regard to the military forces’
monies coming from around the
world— with the United States at
the forefront — to stop Saddam

Hussein’s takeover of Kuwait.’

From the reading and listening I
have done in both the United

States and Israel over the past

few months, this is not the case.
The United States vehemently
does not want Israel to be pulled
into this conﬂict, as it will upset
the U.S.-headed, U.N./Arab
alliance against Saddam. So, Israel
sits with her hands politically tied
but nonetheless is most likely
militarily ready for Saddam’s
attack. They are quite used to
situations like this.l...]

What was most disturbing about
the publishing of this letter was
the blatant irresponsibility of The
PittNewseditorial staff. Using one
man’s opinion as a headline that
read, “Israel to blame for crisis in
the Middle East,” over four
columns of copy was poor
judgment, especially considering
that only a little over one column
consisted of Daniels’ letter. The
other columns contained letters
concerning the attack of Iraq, the
United States causing “genocide”
and “Operation Postcard.” Why
did the ‘editors feel compelled to
grab the public’s attention with
an obviously prejudiced, and I
might add untrue, statement
concerning current events? [...]

America unsafe for Jews

We cannot thank Mr. Thomas
Daniels enough for his very
enlightening letter (TbePittNews
perspective section, Jan. ,9). It

Letters

serves to strengthen our long-
held conviction that his very
eloquently expressed views
concerning Jews and the state of
Israel are sentiments which a
majority of Americans think in
their hearts and minds but are
afraid, for various reasons, of
expressing. J

His irrational and ludicrous
defense of Syria and Iraq, which
for decades served as the major
support bases for international
terrorism, and his extolling of a
“Palestinian” people who, in 1947
with the support of every other
Arab nation, contemptuously
rejected a U.N. partition plan

which would have given them J

their “state,” seems to us to be
ample evidence of the fact that
anti-Semitism is the stepparent of
illogic.

His demagogic, thinly veiled
allusions to the time-dishonored
notion of a “Jewish Conspiracy"
are so blatant and obvious that
only the most morally obtuse Jew
would not undeistand the
underlying implications of his
letter. We hope that Thomas
Daniels’ statements serve to
crystallize in every Jewish mind
one simple fact: America is not
the safe haven Jews had hoped it
would be. 9

Israel not expansionist

[...l [Thomas] Daniels also
accuses Israel of “expansionism,”
ignoring the fact that Israel’s
military operations have always
been defensive responses to Arab
offenses. The only land gained
by Israel after 1948 was during
the 1967 Six-Day War. The war
began because of Arab threats to
“throw the Jews into the sea,”
Nasser’s declaration of war, Arab
military buildup and Nasser’s
blockade of the Straits of Tiran.

Israeli comments uninformed  

Israel, in defending herself against
Egyptian and Jordanian

aggression, emerged victorious-

and in possession of land with
which she didn't know what to
do. Israel never wanted to own
land in which thousands of
displaced Arab refugees were
living (in refugee camps on their
“brothers”' land, Jordan, and
Egypt, for 19 years- 1948-1967!).
Consequently, Israel has not
annexed Judea and Sumeria
(known in the media as the “West
Bank of Jordan”) or Gaza. If
Israel’s aim was expansion, she
would have immediately annexed
all territories won in the defensive
1967 war. Israel, by the way, is
the only country ever admonished
to give back land won in a
defensive war! 9

As for the “crushing the
Palestinian cause,” ever wonder
where Jordan's Hussein is in this
picture if it's his “West Bank?” He
did some serious “Palestinian
cause” crushing in 1970.
Moderate, benevolent King
Hussein slaughtered thousands
of Palestinians outright (no
“shooting in the air” over there).

Zoning solutions too simple
Daniel Alman writes about the
inferior’ housing many Pitt
students are forced to live in
(“Pittsburgh could learn a lesson
from Houston,” Jan. 9), but his
solution is not realistic and his
reasoning is overly simplistic. Yes,
zoning laws exist to limit the
number and type of structures in
an area. However, this limit
ensures that the utilities, services
and roads won’t be
overburdened. Can the current
water, sewage, electrical and
phone systems support higher-
density housing? Traffic
congestion in Oakland is already
overwhelming and parking
problems are chronic [...]

The most telling ingredient in Matthews’

On second thought, maybe it can —— Eric Murdock, 20

one steal.

It was Matthews’ job to guard Murdock, and he stuck
to the Friar All-American candidate like glue, as the
Panthers pasted Providence and upped their Big East
record to 3-1 (14% overall). Providence dropped to 1-3
in the conference and 10-5 overall.

“I thought Jason played outstanding on defense
tonight,” said Pitt Coach Paul Evans. “It was all Jason

on the other side of it, he wasn’t helping anyone else.
We told him just to stay on Murdock.”

Murdock entered the game averaging 28.7 points
per game and 38 on the road. But Matthews kept him '
in check. Murdock scored only six points in the
second half —— two three-pointers that did little to
damage the Panthers’ wire-to-wire lead. '

“I just tried to stay in front of him,” said Matthews,
“and make him pull up and take the jump shot. Our
big men did a great job stepping up on the picks, too.”

Matthews has always been regarded as an

See Matthwes, page 13

Well, it was bound to happen.

After all the recent hype about Eric Murdock and his ungodly
points-per-game average, he was due for a big disappointment.
Pitt’s Jason Matthews had little trouble throwing the normally
sharpshooting guard off his game to the tune of 20 points and a
season-low 29 percent from the field.

But Pitt’s 14th win of the season and third in conference play was
not simplydue to an off—night for one of the Big East’s most
talented point—scorers. Rather, the Panthers’ frontcourt once again
rose to the challenge of replacing the hole left by the injured Bobby

Brian Shorter, Darren Morningstar and Chris McNeal combined
for 49 points and 26 rebounds, while they held Providence big men
Marques Bragg, Tony Turner and Dickey Sirnpkins to only 20

Shorter’s 23-point effort against the Friars, coupled with his
stellar 52-point night a week ago against Syracuse, was yet another
positive sign that the senior forward had snapped out of the
doldrurns which last year’s viral infection had caused.

The statistics sheet is not only testimony to his recovery, but the
intangibles also point in the same direction. Shorter’s rebounds are
now uncontested, almost violent physical statements of ball
possession. His moves to the hoop now punish defenders, and he
draws fouls with regularity. He’s been at the line 26 times in the
past two games. But despite his newfound self, Shorter may be '
playing under less—than-ideal conditions which have nothing to do

“It’s totally different without Bobby in there because he’s a
senior and the other guys are sophomores and juniors, “ Shorter

Women's trackca

By Sharon Kerestes
Sta_[7‘ W1-iter

The sprint-medley and shuttle-relay
teams had record—setting performances,
as the Lady Panther indoor track team
dominated the Michigan Relays on
Saturday.

The sprint—medley relay team, composed
of Keisha Demas, Clarissa Dudley, Ronise
Crumpler and Cathy Chrissos set a new
school record with a time of 3:59.46 and
also broke the University of Michigan's
meet and ﬁeld—house records.

Kim Blair, Dudley, Alexis Archer and

Allison Williams accomplished the same
feats in the shuttle relay with a time of
30.18. ‘

Pitt captured six first places overall and
scored points in 12 of 14 events.

Other ﬁrst-place ﬁnishers were Willliarns,
60~yard hurdles (7.95); Archer, long jump
(18—feet—7 1/2-inches); Dudley, high jump
(S—6 1/2); and the mile-relay team of
Williams, Crumpler, Dudley and Demas,
6:51.17). J

The distance-medley relay of Monica

Hockaday, Blair, Chrissos and Laura,

O’Donnell placed second in 12:09.89, and
Crumpler ﬁnished in 7.08 to place second

in the 60-yard dash.

' The break in training due to the holidays
appears to have had no effect on the Lady
Panthers, but Coach Steve Lewis said the
team is nowhere near its top form at this
point because of the break.

“But just like we had a [holiday] break,
everybody else did, too. So we were all
starting from the same place,” he said.

Approximately 30 teams competed
Saturday, and Pitt’s toughest competition
came from the University of Michigan, a

a traditionally dominant force in the Big Ten

Conference, and Eastern Michigan. “The
kids had a very good meet,” Lewis said.

ptures multiple records in Michigan

“We have to improve on everything on a
regular basis, day by day, to get to the
goals that we'd like to accomplish.”
Those goals include scoring in the NCAA
Championships and ﬁnishing among the
top teams in the Big East Championships.
“We plan to compete on a national level
in all the major meets we’re in,” Lewis
said. “So far [after] step one, we’re OK.”
The majority of the team will have this
weekend off, but a few members will
compete Friday night at Robert Morris,
College, where they’ll gain experience
against local teams, including Robert

PS U leaves Trees Pool with sound win over tirea’ Pant/aers

By Jim Lakely
Staﬂ‘ Writer

The 24th-ranked Penn State
Nittany Lions men’s swim team
rolled into Trees Pool on Saturday
and soundly defeated a fatigued
Panther squad 145-96.

_ Pitt, coming off a grueling and
productive training session over
the holiday break, was no match

for well- rested Penn State, which
dominated nearly every event.

“We were worn down, tired
and sore," said graduate assistant
coach Mike Kozlina. Pitt was
apparently too tired to post many
victories.

Penn State won nine of the 11
swimming events and placed two
of the top three swimmers in
eight events.’ '

Despite the apparent blowout
on the scoreboard, the Panther
coaches were pleased with Pitt’s
performance.

“We had some really nice
swims,” assistant coach Mark
Davin said, “especially in the 200-
yard ﬂy from Joe [Kozlina] and
Kevin [McI.aughlinl.”

Kozlina and McLaughlin

~ finished first and second,

-respectively, in the 200 butterﬂy

ahead of Penn State’s Stuart
Watson, with McLaughlin posting
a lifetime best 1:53.06.

In the 200 freestyle, Kozlina
battled Penn State’s Adam Carroll
in what transpired into a two-
man race. Carroll was able to
hold off Kozlina for the victory by
.2 seconds.

The Pitt wrestling team dropped
its second match in a row Friday
night— this time to the Engineers

of Lehigh University, 20-17, at
Fitzgerald Field House.

The Panthers, still having their
problems in the lower weight

“We don't have a go-to guy in
the lower weights,” said Panther
Coach Rande Stottlemyer. “We
need somebody in the first four
weight classes to not necessarily
win but stir up some excitement.”

The Engineers, coming off
losses to East Stroudsburg,
Michigan, Edinboro and NCAA
powerhouse Iowa, took it right
to Pitt in the first five weight
classes, putting the score at 17-0
in their favor.

But Scott Hovan came out and
showed T oriano Boynton of
Lehigh who the better wrestler
was. Hovan took control of the
match from the first whistle and
never gave Boyton a chance,
winning 19-3.

Le/oiglo Engineers bring too much muscle to the mats

“[Scott] Hovan" is a great kid,
very explosive and a great
wrestler,” said Lehigh Coach Tom
Hutchinson. “He grew up just
down the road from Lehigh, and
we’ve known about him for a

while. ”

After Hovan’s match the
Panthers took three of the next
four matches but couldn’t get
enough points to bring home the
victory.

Sean Gibbs, Jeff Kloiber and
Perry Miller gave Pitt its other
victories.

Stottlemyer was pleased with
his winning wrestlers, especially
the efforts of junior heavyweight
Perry Miller, who came back from
a disappointing draw against
Arizona State last week.

ALL ARE WELCOME!!

Miller defeated Lehigh’s John
Morris, 6-4. Morris is no slouch in
the college-wrestling world,
winning 11 matches at the Las
Vegas Invitational Tournament
this season and placing fourth in
the EIWA Tournament last year.

“Perry is a great kid," said
Stottlemyer. “He busts his hind
end, and he wasn't going to let
the same thing happen at the
Arizona State match. He was the
only one to win one out of our
ﬁve swing matches.”

Two other matches that were
big victories for the Panthers were
Gibbs at 158, and freshman
surprise Kloiber at 190. Both men
wrestled well and came out
victorious with major decisions.

“Shark,” as his friends and

“Kloiber has been wrestling very

outstanding offensive player, but,
as so often happens to scorers,
was labelled a poor defensive
player early in his career —
something he thinks is a bitunfair.

“Last year I heard about it all
the time,” said Matthews. “I don’t
think it was because the coaches
thought I was doing a bad job,
but they just wanted me to do
better.”

Last summer Matthews
decided to work on his foots peed
in order to silence the critics
once and for all. That meant
running on a treadmill and up
and down the steep incline of
Pitt Stadium’s steps with Sean
Miller, something usually
reserved for lazy football players.

“This year I think I have the
desire and the intensity that it
takes,” said Matthews. “I want to
guard the other teams’ best
players. When we played
Connecticut, I wanted to guard
Chris- Smith. When we played
Villanova, I wanted to guard
[Greg] Woodard.” .

This year Matthews says he's
not trying to impress his coaches
— only himself. ‘

“On the whole, I think the
main thing is that I’m playing
consistent,” said Matthews. “My
teammates know that they can
count on me for a certain amount
of points, a certain amount of
defensive plays and a certain
amount of assists and other
things.”

“[McNeal and Morningstarl are
doing great, and I can depend on
them. But Bobby’s been there,
and just his being a senior is a big
factor for us and our chemistry
out there, especially when we
come down the stretch.”

McNeal was named Player of
the Game for his 15-point, six-
rebound performance. His 15-
foot jump shot adds a key weapon
in allowing Pitt’s backcourt to
score outside the paint. Shorter
has been trying to use that shot
for two years running but has
basically stuck with strong post
moves.

“Being that the coach puts me
in during key situations really
helps me out a lot. And that
jumper really helps me because
Ox [Shorter] can dish the ball to
me at the foul line, and I can hit
that shot when he's double-
teamed,” McNeal said.

Morningstar, who has become
a crowd favorite this year after
receiving his share of heat from
. both the fans and the press last
 season, has earned a reputation
 for physical play around the
league. He has been known to
mix it up with some of the bigger
names in the Big East during his

career, including Alonzo
Mourning, Malik Sealy and Billy
Owens, to name a few.

“I noticed that teams have in
their scouting reports now that I
throw cheap shots. It’s not true.
Because people physically play
me, I have to counter them. If I let
guys get in front of me in this
league, I'll get scored on all year
long,” Morningstar said.

“We all have our certain roles:
Chris is a good shooter; Brian is
just great all—around, and I’m a
good defensive player. I can help
make defensive stops and make
some key rebounds,” he added.

Morningstar currently has 72
rebounds on the year (16 in
conference play) for a 4.2 rpg
average (4.0 in the Big East).
Morningstar, Shorter and Martin
are all tied for the team lead in the
