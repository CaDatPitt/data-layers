THE MOl3l3Rl\I ._ i 
* e e e ALUMNI ASSOCIATION.

[From anxaddress delivered by E.
B. Johnson, Alumni Secretaryof the
'Univer~sltyg. of Minnesota and iPr7esi-
dent of‘ the National Association _.of
iA1i.Tmni'S,iecretaries,. at the; A_1i’»I'n11i8.,l
Convention, Chicago, Illinois, Novem-
ber Zl, 1913.] L

The modern alumni association is
a.b_usi.ness o'rgani‘zation——-it is orgaﬂ—
ized for eﬂiciency.’ Its only reason
todbe is that it affords/thef_individ1_1al
alumnus opportunity to greatly Hi-‘
crease the efficiency of his individual
effort in behalf of the institution, and
enables him tolkeep initouch with
fellow alumni. _ 9 J

The philosophy of organized alumni
effort is simply that of the modern
business conso1idation—-for, efficiency.
_It has been brought about through.
the recognition of the fact, that a
very moderate amount‘ of organized
loyaltyis worth an unlimited amount
of unorganized good will. Through
a‘ sense of gratitude, or, through a
reciognition of public duty, as aluirini,
weare desirous of_doi_ng something
that is really worthwhile for the in-
§titution to which we owe allegiance.
We are ready to do something ‘if we
can be sure that ‘that .something_ is
really worth while.,, VVe cannot give
the time necessary‘ to go into, the
problems‘ and 0 determine, . for  our-
selves, just_where our indiv1dua,~lWef-
fort will count. Hence werhave em-
ployed the paid secretary wh0.‘§e‘d_11ll}'
is to keep in tout. with the institu-
tion and tolgive us. the facts upon
which we may predicate our Judgment
and upon which we mayiact with In-
telligence and without loss of effort;
The unselﬁsh support of the alumni
of any institution, ifintelligently di-
rected, represents a treme.ndo_us force
for the beneﬁt of the institution. _/
