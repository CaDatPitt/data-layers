Attendance Is

Compulsory For
Male Students

By IRWIN ROSEN
Representatives of the Army,
Navy, and Marines will be on hand
at the University today to explain
details, to answer questions, to
give information, to all students in-
terested in the various reserve

‘ COI‘pS programs.

- The three service officers will be

‘heard ﬁrst at an assembly of all

male undergraduate students at
Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial
auditorium this morning at 10:30
o’clock.
Attendance is required of all
male students who will be excus-
‘ ed from third hour classes and
who will be granted excuses for
late entrance into fourth hour
classes, should the meeting run
over one hour.
Classes will be conducted as
, usual for all women, according to
‘ Dean of Women Helen Rush.
After students have heard the

V ‘officers at the assembly, they will

be given an opportunity to confer
with them individually this after-
noon when the men will be station-
ed at different rooms on the second
ﬂoor of the Cathedral of Learning.
From 1:15 untl 3:30 o'clock

the Army representative will be
-in 216, the Army Air Force rep-
resentative in 221, the Navy rep-
resentative in 226, (for those in-
terested in V-1 and V-7) and in

230 for those interested in the

V-5 program, and the Marine rep-

resentative will interview stu-

dents in room 249.

V-1 members are considered ap-
prentice seamen in the naval re-
serve, and after completion of one
year’s work at the University they
will be transferred into either V-5
or V-7.

V-5 is the naval aviation reserve

program. Those who elect V-5 will .
be permitted to ﬁnish the second

calendar year of university work
and then they will be transferred
to the Navy for training as officer
pilots.

Those who elect V-7 will be per-
mitted to remain at the University
until they have completed work for
degrees. Then they will go into the
Navy training course preparatory
to receiving ensign’s commissions.

It is well to bear these basic
differences between the Navy’s

“V” programs in mind before ap-

plying for any of them.

The University conference this
morning is part of a nation wide

tour _of all universities and col-

leges to make further known to

students opportunities in the en-
listed reserve corps programs
that are open to them.

No one is to enlist in any reserve
corps today, it was stressed by
Lawrence R. Irwin, service co-ordi-
nator. Today’s sessions are only to
clear up any confusion about the
various reserve corps programs
that students may have. The offi-
cers will be back on campus in a few
weeks. It is at this time that stu-
dents who are interested should
enlist.

Go-and Bring Your Questions

This morning’s appearance of
members of the Army, the Navy,
and the Marines to explain and to
clear up questions on the various
enlisted reserve programs marks
the most signiﬁcant attempt yet
taken by the government to clear
up the confusion that has thus far
marked all the reserve corps plans.

When will the reserve corps
members he called? What are his
chances for graduation, even un-
der the accelerated program?

What about the scholastic and

physical requirements? What is

the attitude of the Army and the

Navy towards men already en-

rolled in college?——all this we

want to know.

And about all these things we’ve
heard wild rumors, garbled press
reports, denials that sounded too
much like high—pressure business
talks from educational leaders.

Now at last we’re going to get
the truth. It is the patriotic duty of
every male student to not only at-
tend these meetings and talk with
the service representatives——-but to
ask questions, frankly, fearlessly,
and intelligently.

Questions like the ones we’ve
raised above. Questions that

‘ each individual student may have

on his mind. Because these men
ARE the Army, the Navy, and
the Marines—and it is only
through hearing from us, the
students, that they can explain
and make known their reserve
plans with less muddling and con-
fusion on the part of all con-
cerned.

10:30

Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial—
Talks on the Army, the Navy, the
Marine reserve corps program by
representatives from each of these
armed services. Men will be ex-

cused from classes but the wom-

en’ll have to attend.

The service representatives will
be stationed in various rooms of
the Cathedral to answer questions
and grant personal interviews.

216—The Army.

221—The _Army Air Force.

226--The Navy (V-1 and V-7).
