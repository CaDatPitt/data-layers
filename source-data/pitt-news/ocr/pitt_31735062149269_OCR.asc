University Goal
In Fund Drive

Students W7 ill Pledge
Contributions Monday

Ten thousand dollars, to be sub-
scribed by the students and facul-
ty, is the aim of the University
Community Fund drive, J. G.
Quick, chairman of thedrive, has
announced.

Approximate a third of this
sum, or an average of one dollar
per student, will be subscribed
by the undergraduate schools. The
drive among the students is being
directe'd by a committee of stu-
dents and faculty members under
Dr. Vincent: W. Lanfear, dean of
men. _ '

'1‘wenty-eight faculty members
will meet with Mr. Quick at a
luncheon meeting for faculty so-
licitors at 1 o'clock tomorrow in
the Faculty Club. At this time
the faculty drive, to extend to
November 23, will otiicially start.

Faculty solicitors will work in
their respective departments in an

attempt to better the $7,406,40
record set last year.
Student workers, in coopera-

tion with faculty speakers, will
begin the student drive the third
hour next Monday. All 85 classes
in session at that time will be ad-
dressed either by an instructor
or a member of the student com-
mittee. Student aides will collect
the pledges and distribute the red
feathers or automobile stickers.

All students who give at least a
dollar to the Community Fund
will also receive a membership
card in the American Red Cross.
Each student must give an aver-
age of one dollar if the Univer-
sity’s quota is to be reached.

Last year the University ranked
so much higher than any other
Pittsburgh school in collections
that the other district colleges in-
vestigated the University’s meth-
ods in preparation for this drive.

Explorer Lectures on Tibet
Before Arts, Science Academy

One of the few white men everé

to visit Tibet, Mr. Theos Bernard, l
of New York, gave an illustratedi
lecture on that mysterious coun-
try before the Pittsburgh Acade-I
my of Science and Art last Thurs-
day night.

One of the few theocracies left:
in the world, Tibet is closed coun- ;
try to non-Buddhists.‘ Only a‘
handful of explorers have been
able to enter’ the country, most
of them posing as Buddhists.

Mr. Bernard is a student and
admirer of the Buddhist philoso-
phy and because of his intimate
knowledge Of‘ the Tibetan reli-
gion and customs, he was ablerto
secure a special permit to enter
the country and study old manu-
scripts at ﬁrst hand.

Gone for two years, Mr. Bern-
ard was the first non-Buddhist
ever given permission to enter the
most holy Tibetan temples. The
lamas, or Tibetan priests gain
merit in the eyes of Buddha by

These lamas also_ prepare for
eternal bliss by the performance

gof miracles ,which have never

properly been explained. Among

,%them is the favorite trick of dis-
zrobing completely, and going out

into the freezing blasts of a Him-

, alayan mid-winter, and remaining

thus, fasting and praying for days,
or even weeks. V

Among other discoveries. Mr.
Bernard discovered and took pic-
tures of a Tibetan temple that ap-
peared to be the" double, in arch-
itecture at least, of the famous
Shangri-La of _“Lost Horizon.”
I-Vhile it may not have Owned a
lama hundreds of years old, it did
possess elephants, which are al-
most as rare.

To import these beasts into
Tibet is a long and arduous under-
taking, for the elephants are
forced to walk over the highest
ranges of the Himalayas in order

constructing prayer wheels, con-
sisting of a wheel on which are
pasted hundreds of little slips of
paper bearing the holy words.
“Om mani padme hum,” meaning,
“Hail, O thou jewel of the Lotus
flower.”

miles this week-end.” ' ' ' '

“It is important that we have
every one down at the station’ that
it is possible to get down there.
This rally is more important than
any we have had -yetlthis year. _It
Wlll mean more than I can say

Pitt Players Stage Condensed
Version of Sl1aw’s War Drama

By Ruggero Aldisert

Presenting the most ambitious
anti-war propaganda since its in-
ception, Pitt Peace Council, in co-
operation with Inquiry Forum and
Pitt Players, gave a condensed
version of Irwin Shaw’s “Bury the
Dead” last Monday.

Five members of the Players
and Robert Saffron, program di-
rector of Peace Council, standing
in the darkened room, read the
tense drama of Shaw’s specially
prepared digest play.

Acting of the group was excel-
lent. In accordance with the
script, the six shifted from one
role to another with ease. The
play concerns four dead soldiers
who refuse to be buried.

Revolting against the stupid
slaughter of war, they are de-
termined to make the most of this
after-life that has been granted
them; to tell the world of the
meaningless mumbo-jumbo of
military campaigns.

John Weisbrod was easily out-
standing, his voice fulﬁlling the
demands of this new theater tech-
nique. Laudable also were Peggy
Nelson, Earl Riley, Saffron, Dick
Klemer, and Lorene Kessler. Call-
ed upon to give ﬁnished perform-
ances on a ﬁrst reading of the
script, they came through easily
to give the best dramatic presen-
tation of the year.

Dr. Hart Leads
Y Panel Group

Discussing the question, “Mod—
ern Youth Faces His World,” Dr.
Hornell Hart of the sociology de-
partment of Duke university will
open the ﬁrst “Y” Junior Forum at
the Belleﬁeld avenue YM-WHA,
4 o’clock Sunday afternoon.

Inaugurating the ﬁrst discussion
group of its kind in the city, the
forum will deal exclusively with
youth and youth interests, featur-
ing nationally recognized speakers.

Tickets may be obtained from
members of the committee or at
the Y. University students on the
committee are, Howard Schwartz,
C41, chairman; Bill Mazefsky, C40,
and Charlotte Levy, C39.

(Continued From Page One)
with the Community Fund, 75 per
cent of the student contribution
will be diverted into University
projects. The YMCA and YWCA
will each receive 20 cents of every
dollar contributed; the men’s and
women’s student loan funds will
each get 15 cents; and the remain-
ing nickel goes to Pitt in China.

The student drive will continue
in the 62 classes in session during
the second hour Tuesday.

The student drive committee in-
cludes the following committee
members: Dr. Lanfear, Robert
Corley, assistant dean of men;
Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
women; Miss Helen Pool Rush,

Five Additional Sports Feature
Winter Intramural Program

THE PITT NEWS

By BILL McELWAIN

cess of the fall program and con-
fﬁdent that its few weak spots can
,,be .1 eliminated, James Potts, Di-
rector of Intramural Athletics,
looks to the new winter program
as even more important than the
fall setup.
A The initial steps have been taken
in the reorganization of Pitt m-
tramurals through the medium of
the fall activities. Can the winter
program add to the ground already
gained? Potts believes that it can
and will.
Three Leagues Compete

In structure, the new program is
practically identical with the fall
plan, competition being divided
among three leagues. One circuit
will consist of the 13 social frater-
nities in IF Council, the second
will include teams from the vari-
ous divisions of the School of En-
gineering and Mines, and the third
"will be made up of teams not
classiﬁed under the ﬁrst two
groups.

However, any campus organiza-
tion may form a league within
their own group if they so desire.
The leagues will be run according
"to separate schedules with the
-league champions meeting at the
close of the season in playoff
matches.

Sports included in the new pro-
gram are basketball, volleyball,
handball, table tennis, and bowl-
-ing- . All entries must be turned in

. to the Intramural Ofﬁce no later
. than November 22, and team man-
- agers should make a particular ef-
i fort to have their team entered on
_ time. Playin all leagues will be-
I gin December 7.

Small Groups Eligible
As has been stressed frequently,

.".t'5'iit is not necessary for a student to,
’ 3 belong to a large, organization in

i order to engage in intramural ath-

3 letics. For -example, in the winter»

program, any six boys can go to-
gether and have enough men to

‘enter a team in any of the ﬁve

- sports.
" Individual male students not en-
tered in the program or the Fresh-
'- man Sports ‘Program may take ad-
vantage of the special intramural
athletic privileges upon payment
of $1.00 "per semester. The privi-
leges include use of locker‘ and
towel, towel laundry service, use
of the swimming pool, use of the
tennis courts, use of the -handball
courts, and use of sports equip-
-ment. ’
Payment of the $1.00 fee will be
by means of the purchase of a
metal check at the University Book
Store, ﬁrst floor of the Cathedral
of Learning, This check must be
'.presented at the Trees Gymnasium
equipment room whenever usage

'of the attending privileges is de-'

sired.

Few Violations
3. While eligibility has been a
_' inoriissue in the fall program,
“ﬁe few violations of the eligibility
code have usually been concerned
with Rule 2, which states, “No
player can participate in more than
two sports during the same season,
nor can he play on two teams in
the same sport.”

This means that,‘for example, a
man can not play in the Engineer-
ing League and also play for his
fraternity team. The reason is
obvious, for should both teams en-
ter the playoffs, he would be faced
with the rather ticklish job of
playing both for and against him-
self.

Brieﬂy,*the plans for each sport
in the winter program are as fol-
lows:

BASKETBALL

Any group wishing to organize
a team should report to Trees
Gymnasium before November 23.
A round robin tournament will be
played.

VOLLEYBALL
 There will be six men to a team.
Organize a team and report to
Trees Gymnasium before Novem-
ber 23. A round robin tourna-

won and lost rather than matches.
Round robin tournaments will be
played.
TABLE TENNIS

There will be four men to a
team. Final standings will be de-
termined on a basis of games won
and lost. A round robin tourna-
ment will be played. “

BOWLING

Intramural bowling teams con-

A round robin tournament will be

Playoffs of the three touch foot-
ball leagues will begin tomorrow
afternoon at 4 o’clock. In the
opening game the Engineering
League champion will meet the
Independent League leader. The
winning fraternity team meets the
first round winner on Monday, No-
vember 14.

The two losers will then thrash

with the ﬁnal game of the playoff
series falling on Thursday, No-

course and ended up on the wrong
end of a 26-29 score.

The feature of the meet was the
brilliant running of Smith of State
whose splendid time of 26:05 min-
utes set a new course record.
Smith is ranked as the outstand-
ing cross-country runner in the
nation this year and is a heavy
favorite to win the IC4A cham-
pionship in New York this month.

Pitt Soccer Team l
Wins First Game

Keeping right in the spirit of’
one of the most dismal week-ends

Panther soccer team dropped a
close 1-0 decision to the Slippery
Rock Teachers College booters
last Friday on the Slippery Rock
Field.

Poe, Pitt goal-tender, turned in
a remarkable exhibition in the
ﬁrst oﬁicial game of the season,
but the Pitt offense sputtered
weakly and kept Poe in constant
hot water. One well aimed shot
eluded the husky goalie, and the
contest was settled right there.

Despite the setback, Coach
Ward is still rather optimistic
about his club’s chances of defeat-
ing Frostburg Teachers at Frost-
burg, Maryland, this Saturday.
Fifteen men will make the trip.

who was the guy who pro-

foundly observed that much water has flowed over the clam since

the News has been its own self? . .

to say the dam has broken .

in November are to be included in the appraisal . .

. it is much more to the point.

Revivifying the seventh Pitt
game this year may be inapropri-
ate at this time being that
the gory details have been virtual-
ly forgotten on this side of Oak-
land . . in View of our difficul-
ties in publication this week it is
possible that our further discus-
sion will be tolerated . . at least
tor the record . . first let it be
repeated for more than the record
that on the 5th day of November
of the year 1938 the Carnegie Tech
Tartans were the, best football
team that played in the Pitt Sta-
diun:

1:

And by the moral law that
states that right will triumph in
the end, they had more points at
the completion of the fourth quar-
ter and Jack Lee was given" the
ball to keep . . why they were
the better grid machine last Sat-
urday: has already been explained
and may .fui'tl:-er be explained by
the very fact that football teams
aren’t machines but :2: sur-
prising  it may seem, they are
delicately human groups . . who
win and lose because of warmly
human factors the Tartans
have spent two years buildingup,’
physically and emotionally, to last
Saturday . . while the Panthers
had just ﬁnished six weeks of
playing football teams who Were
in the very same mood that Car-
negie was able to capitalize
on . . . 1

i: >24 3: _

Further was the reason that
Carnegie had a team of very high
ability which knew better than
(anyone else could possibly know
what to do against Pitt . . being
that the men who were telling the

but weé

‘play it was the real Pitt .

Clansmen what to do were the
same men who devoted almost as
much time two years ago seeing
what the present Panthers were
doing, what they could do, and
also telling them what was

right. . .

As Al Lezouski said, “It was like
playing‘ against the mirror” . .
except that the mirror in this case
was in a whole lot better condi-
tion . . . it did look, though, like
Pitt A team playing Pitt B team
. . . Tech did have a very lovely
backfield, featuring Condit, who
was as slipery as any West Vir-
ginia snake . . it still lacked
the Sutherland specialty of those
first fast three steps . . . but
once they got started they had all
the drive that could be asked for
and were accordingly ‘hard to
bring down Carnegie play-
ed it right . . goi11g.right-
through the Pitt tackles ’

Through the opening minutes of‘
. that
3' s before the tiring of the past two
fmonthsicaught up with the boys
. and thatwas also before
_.7.‘.v'lai‘sliall Goldberg left the game
. . . there was only one reason
"that Goldberg started the game
that was because on Satur--

day morning he vzent up to Dr.
Sutherland and said, “I really feel
swell today my knee is al-
"together better” . he was con-
vincing enough to convince his
coach that he was really‘ ready
on the first play he took the

first two men. that were in posi-

tion to nab Curly Stebbins

Maybe it be added that the boys
gave everything they had on Sat-
urday . they gave everything
-they could they gave. but
it just wasn’t there that is
the most that can be asked from

terfraternity touch football
league.

Delta Tau Delta. favorite in the
winners bracket lost in an over-
ime period to the Phi Gams, 2-0.
The game lacked the thrills of
previous games in the league and
was purely a defensive game wit.h
neither team threatened to score;
The only «score resulted when
Chuck Cooper attempted to pass
from behind his goal nine and
Fred Bcntzel broke through to
‘tab him in the end zone.

Phi Delts l/Vin

Phi Delta Theta put an end to
the uprising of the Pi Lams by
winning an over time game, 7-6.

The Pi. Lams scored first when
Larry Katz :grabbed a short pass
in the end zone in the first half.
In the second half the Phi Delts
halted another Pi Lam drive and
turned around to put a scare into
the Pi Lams as they advanced the
ball to the ﬁve-yard line only to
lose it on downs as Parks’ fourth
down pass to Cashdollar was bat-
ted down. '

It remained for lanky Jack
Scherer, Dr. Carlson’s basketball
center, to come out as the game’s
hero. In the last two minutes of
play. the Phi Delts made a first
down on the Pi Lam ten-yard
line.

In three downs they advanced
to the ﬁve-yard line. and on fourth
down Pee Wee Parks shot a high
was covered by three men but
pass to Jackin the end zone. Jack
managed to snatch the “pigskin”
out of the ozone‘ and clutch it to
his chest as he fell to the ground.
Park attempted a pass to Black
for the extra point but it was bat-
ted down. The Phi Delts kicked
to the Pi Lams but the whistle
ending the game blew before an-
other play was run.

Race Narrows

In the extra period Bill Angel
slipped past the Pi Lam defense
to tab Katz for a ﬁve-yard loss.
On the following play Parks pass-
ed to Smith deep in Pi Lam ter-
ritory and when the Pi Lams were
unable to get out of colﬁn corner,
Phi Delta Theta was awarded one
point for advancing deeper into
the opponents’ territory after the

conclusion of ﬁve plays for each

team. I .

Past games found Pi Kappa Al-'

pha still in" the running after de-

fea'ting_ Phi Eps intheir most re-
cent /encounter. The race has
narrowed down to four teams in-
cluding Phi
Delts, and PiKA. 
‘Today, the-Delts play the win‘-
-ner~ of yes‘te'rday’s contest beltweenl
Phi Delts and PiKA. Tomorrow,
the Phi Gams play the ultimate
winner of these three teams with
a possible additional contest if the
Phi Gams should taste defeat.
Next W ednesday’s issue will
carry the
Football team. The» team will be

selected through the athletic di-
rectors of the thirteen fraternities.

BET’S
‘ OFF!

Although most of‘ those who
played the long end Saturday
were in for much disappoint-
ment, some bets had a silver
lining. For example, the case
of Sam Rosenberg, University,
marshal.

His bet went like this. In or-
der to secure the kerosene for
Friday evening's bonﬁre at Rus-
kin field, Sam contacted one of
Socony-Vacuum’s local officials
who agreed to supply 50'gall'ons.
But, the official also turned out

i to be a Tech man and he made
the agreement with stipula-
tions. If Pitt won, the kerosene
would be on Socony-Vacuum
and Tech. If Tech won, it
would be on the SFA bonﬁre
committee.

The only catch was that the
SFA funds had been used to the
limit and Sam was informed
he’d have to take care of the bet
himself. But Rosenberg tool-:
advantage of the Tartan celebra-
tion Monday and talked to his"
Socony—Vacuum friend. The re-
sult was that the whole thing
was called off.

With the opening game just two”
weeks away, hockey Coach John
Mcsorley has settled down to“ mak-
ing a team out of the 19 players
who have survived his elimina-
tions. ‘ c ‘

At yesterday’s practice a tenta-
tive line showing Taylor Brittain
at right wing. Dick Friday at'~-:en-
ter, and Bob Schooley at left wing
worked against an equally tenta-
tive combination which had Bob
Lowe at right wing, Clyde Shiring
at center and Irv Artz at left wing.
Alternating at the defense posi-
tions were Walter Lovett and Len
Broido, Chuck Connick and Pat
Cusick and, Joe Roger and Charles
Duﬁey. Bud Ellis was in the goal.
V The combination of Lowe, Shir-
ing and Artz makes a line that is
fast and hard hitting, backed up
with weight. As a scoring threat
it should compare favorably with
last year's starting trio, the
“mighty mites,” Brittain, Friday
and Schooley.

Lowe, one of last year's letter-
men, is the most improved man on
the squad. Finishing last season.
handicapped, with his arm in a
cast, he promises to be one of the
key men on this year's team. Pat

Each week “Campus Canvass” brings to you, via. The ’Neu2s,i-u
question, timely and of student -interest. The students whose_"an-
swers appearzsare selected aL.ra11.do71z. throughout the U.m'versity. ~.

The QUESTION:  ,
“What do -yotrithink of-last sat-
urday‘s upset, victory by. Carnegie
Tech?

The AN SWER:
Ike W'eiuer, E1339.

“I was compelled to listen to
the game via radio and it was
quite some time before I could
convince myself that it was not
another Orson Welles melo-
drama."

‘.“We’v5e heard a lot about-the
spirit of the. Tech team but I
think we have something that
goes far deeper than ordinary
rah—rah! spirit. Saturday we
saw Dr. Sutherland sacriﬁce per-
sonal glory and the one remain-
ing possibility of victory .
keeping l‘vIarshal1 Golvlberg‘ out
of the game, in order to ‘:_.u'event
further injury to the .~\ll-.-\mer-
ican back. A disabled player
would have meant an empty
victory. Our hats are off to you,
Dr. Sutherland.”

Marshall Goldberg, C39.

“I think that Tech probably
played the best game that they
have or will play all year. hey
were pointing for us all year and
did play good football. They
deserved to win."

Ja-ck Hoeveler. Col. "40.
“It took ten years and ﬁve
Pitt coaches to beat us.”

Paul Friedlander, Carnegie Tech
Quarterback.

“It was a great victory. It
was probably very lucky for us
that Pitt was without their star
and spark-plug, Marshall Gold-
berg; however I believe, that the
real difliculty with the Pitt team
was that they were not quite as
desirous of winning this game 
as we were. I think the victory ; “I think Tech outplayed Pitt

' week before which weakened
our team.

The first ﬁfteen seconds were
ours; and I thought it would be
on all Pitt game with Tech not

Bonnie Bess Worline, Grad.

"I was thrilled with the ap-
plause of the Pitt students when
Tech made their iirst touchdown
and the quality of the playing
of both teams. The inten;~‘ity
with which the Pitt team played
up until the last whistle, to me,
indicated real sportsmanship.”

:.Hea“d<West ‘- 

Hardly yet in scrimmagable con-
dition, the Pitt varsity entrains
tonight for Lincoln, Nebraska and
Saturdays encounter with the
keyed-up Cornhuskers.

Yesterday the team was given
a chance. to look at the moving
pictures of‘last Saturdays meet-
ing with the Carnegie Tech Tar-
tans. They saw how for the first
time this year and for the first
time in 22 games they were de-
feated. The score was 20-10 in
favor oi‘ the Kern-Baker Skibos.

First picture to ﬂash across the
scene had handsome Harold Steb-
bins as the star. He ﬂashed down-
ﬁeld for 97 yards, aided and abet-
ted by the spectacular blocking
of Goldberg, Dannies, and Petro.
Bill Daddio kicked the seventh
point after this opening touch-
down.

Six plays later they watched
lVIerlynCoudit throw a 40 yard pass
to George Muha in much the same
way it used to go Heller-to-Reich
er, except this was Tech scoring.
The extra point was made good.

Then in inglorious succession
came a field goal by Daddioand
two touchdowns by Carnegie. The
first came within 8 seconds of the
‘ ‘close of the first half. The second
immediately after the beghming
.ol' the fourth quarter.

Streigal caught the pass over the
goal line and Muha pounded over
guard. ‘ ~

The War
And My Country

By Kuan Han Sun

One year has quickly passed
since I left my own country. In
the past year my life has been
peaceful in a material way and
terrible in a spiritual sense. Dur-

ing the first few months in this
country, every time I read the pa-
per about the war in my country,
I wept in my inner heart for the
terrible sufferings of my country
and people.

Peace is an abstract term, espe-
cially for those who live in peace
for a long time. When I read on
the pictorial page of the New
York Times “Happy are the Na-
tions that build bridges instead of
forts,” describing the newly built
bridge between Michigan and
Canada, I really taste again the
meaning of the word “Peace!”

Can you imagine what it would
be like if all nations threw away
their weapons and cooperated cor-
dially in the development of the
world’s civilization? But instead
of lovely peace, there is war in
my country.

I recall a story of my boyhood.

One day, when I was eleven,
as I walked with a little boy of my '
own age on a ﬂooded road along a
pool, my playmate suddenly drop-
ped into the pool. Without hesi-
tating, I lowered my hands to my
little friend and pulled him out
from the pool. If, at that critical
moment, I had refrained from
rescuing that little boy, I might be
able to defend myself on the basis
of law, but I would never be able
to defend myself on the point of
view of humanity.

From that story I turned to the
policy of isolation of this country
toward the present war in the
Far East. I would criticize the
fact that America has supplied 54
per cent of the necessary war ma-
terials to Japan in her aggressions
in China if_I had forgotten the
vast moral sympathy that the ma-
Jority of American people has
given to China,

The above was written before
the fall of Canton and Hankow.
I ams worried about situation in
my country but I am glad to know‘
that our government will carry
on the resistance no matter how
difﬁcult the situation will be, for
our government believes the ﬁnal
victory will be us.

The aggressor may win the war
temporarily but will never be able
to change belief of our people,
that, there is “no compromise with
the aggressor.”

. . . that’s the reason C/zesterﬁeld

The reason Chesterfield is
different is because it combines the

It’s the riglzt combination of these
tobaccos . '. . mild ripen home-grown
