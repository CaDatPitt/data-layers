Pitt's director of public safety
met with William Moore, chief of
the Pittsburgh Police yesterday to
insure last weekend's violence on
the corner of Forbes Avenue and
Bouquet Street in Oakland doesn't
happen again.

"The Pittsburgh Police in-
dicated to me they would give us
more support by bringing in ad-
ditional resources,” said Public
Safety Director William Tucker.

Eyewitnesses said over a hun-
dred black youths clogged up

Forbes Avenue, jumping on top of
cars and robbing Pitt students.
Campus police said they arrested
five black males of high school
age.

”It’s pretty bad if the campus
police can't control their own
campus,” said Pitt student Debra
Kolesar, who is organizing
students attacked last weekend.
”When they are rocking cars in
the street with people inside them,
that is ridiculous. Something has
to be done."

Kolesar said eight students
came to a meeting Monday night,
saying they had items stolen from
them Saturday. She said there
were 12 witnesses to the in-
cidents. '

Walt Waters, Pitt's assistant
director for field operations, said
the campus police needed more
help from the city.

’’We were caught off guard, and
we apologize, but we won't get
caught off guard again,” Waters
said. i

”We’ll take our share of the .

blame, but we need assistance
_from the city in that area [the in-
tersection of Forbes Avenue and
Bouquet Street],” he said.

”From what I can tell, they were
not Pitt students, they were high
school age students from around
the area.

”Downtown Pittsburgh has
become so dead. Maybe they
come [to] where they think the
nightlife is,”‘ Waters said;

”Black people wouldjust rip

said Pitt Sophomore Debbie

PITTSBURGH — The Federal Avia-
tion Administration announced Mon-
day it was joining a probe into
possible drug abuse among flight
crew members at USAir.

The probe will involve local FAA
officials and other investigators from
New York, and will review informa-
tion covered during a continuing
grand jury probe in Pittsburgh as well
as news accounts first published in
The Pittsburgh Press.

In The Pittsburgh Press article, doc-
tors and nurses at six area hospitals
said they treated at least 23 cases of
drug abuse by flight crew personnel,
including pilots. And among those
treated for drug abuse 18 worked for
USAir.

The hospital personnel said they

A USAir spokesman, who claims

that the company has been deluged

' with hundreds of calls from angry

passengers, said that at no time was

the safety of passengers in jeopardy

because the crew personnel allegedly
abusing drugs were off duty.

Waldheim linked
to Nazi atrocities

JERUSALEM — The World Jewish
Congress said on Tuesday that it had
discovered a new document that
positively links Austrian President
Kurt Waldheim to Nazi atrocities.

According to that document, which
the WJC said it unearthed in its na-
tional archives, Waldheim, as an in-'
telligence officer for the Nazis during
World War II, approved a package of
propaganda leaflets that included a
call to ’’kill the Jews.” The leaflets
also included such titles as ”The Jews
Prepared This War.”

Waldheim has repeatedly said that
although he did in fact work as an in-
telligence officer for the Nazis, he‘did
not know of any atrocities be/ing com-
mitted.

The Jewish group is demanding
that Waldheim be barred from

visiting the United States because of
his Nazi past and has turned over the

_METULLA, Israel -— Hundreds of

they were ready to push into
southern Lebanon to destroy an of-

Another Israeli official denied that

Israeli troops were preparing such an

The "preparations could be aimed
at bolstering the South Lebanon
Army, a force of 1,000 Lebanese

designated buffer zone in South
Lebanon stretching six to 10 miles
above the border.

Pretoria miners
disrupt services

EVAN DER, South Africa - Nearly
200 black gold—miners, shouting
union slogans and tribal chants,
disrupted services Monday at a com-
pany memorial for 177 miners who
died in a mine fire last week.

The miners repeatedly shouted that
they wanted to have their own rites,
not ”white rites.”

Holding clubs over their heads, the
frenzied miners raced through the
outdoor service many times, drown-
ing out sermons by white and black

’ preachers.

The Vmine workers union said it
holds the mine owners ”ful|y respon-
sible for the tragic loss of 177
precious lives, lives that have made
possible the millions in riches that the
mining bosses have today.”

South African President P.W. Botha
said Tuesday that the mine’s safety
standards were ”adequate” and in-
vited foreign governments to send
their officials to inspect the mine.

Panel

meets to
discuss
divesting

By Christopher Sepesy

For The Pitt News

A compromise on the upcom-
ing divestment vote has been pro
posed by the advisory committee
to the finance committee of the
board of trustees.

”The compromise, though it
will probably be voted on unan-
imously, is made up of three dif-
ferent proposals and does not
represent all the feelings of the
committee. What it is really show-
ing is a present consensus,” said

The Great Peace March for Global
Nuclear Disarmament will be setting
up camp this Thursday in Schenley
Park as part of a two-day crusade
through the city of Pittsburgh.

it will begin with a noon parade at
Market Square and end in an over-
night stay at the park before they
begin marching for their final destina-
tion in Washington D.C.

They hope to reach the capital ci-
ty by Nov. 15. But as Jim Marsh,
spokesman for the over 700 march-
ers, explained, their journey has not
been one without difficulties.

Marsh said that after the original
funds, estimated at $3.5 million,
were depleted, the former pro-peace
organization, headed by David Mix-
ner of Denver, filed for bankruptcy
and revamped its title to Great Peace

Of the original 1,100 marchers
who started in Los Angeles, 300
decided to remain after they received
a message in the Mohavi desert that
the march had financially collapsed.

According to Marsh, efforts were
made by former pro-peace staffers to
elicit personal contributions in order
to continue the march.

”That’s when it went from a
marketing idea to a grass-roots move-
ment,” said Marsh.

wished to remain anonymous.’

The subcommittee is made up
of 12 members of Pitt's faculty,
staff and student body, and was
formed by Pitt President Wesley
Posvar to furthur inform the
finance committee on the popu-
lar opinions of the Pitt communi-
ty concerning divestment from
South Africa.

The proposed compromise will
be presented to the finance com-
mittee during its meeting on Oct.
7. They will then render their own
decision to the board of trustees
on Oct. 14.

Subcommittee member Jim
Mumma said that he could not
disclose details of the com-
oromise, but, ”|t-’s a compromise
between immediate divestment
and the current policy.”

Dennis Brutus, chairman of
Pitt's black studies program and
a former South African political
prisoner, is also committed to the
goal of total divestment from
South Africa. ”|nitially there is no
alternative to divestment. It must
be done totally and immediately.
The only other consideration is
that it is done sensibly and not
recklessly,” said Brutus.

Brutus, however, does not
believe that divestment should be
the sole step against apartheid.

but it is not the only one,” he , _

”Second, an end to all diplomatic

Forbes war zone

isn't going away

It was only nine days ago that The Pitt News acknowledged the
corner of Forbes Avenue and Bouquet Street as a trouble area. This
paper proposed that the city and campus police clean up the area
before the situation worsens. Evidently,_ our proposal fell on deaf ears.

Ask anyone who dared to cross that intersection this past weekend
and he will tell you it was the worst ever. Harassment, theft, assault
— take your pick. '

City police had to be called in from several different precincts in
an attempt to alleviate the problem, and campus policemen did not
offer much assistance, claiming they are understaffed. Pitt Public Safe-
ty Director William Tucker and City Police Chief William Moore met
to discuss the problem yesterday morning. Bravo fellas!

That is the correct action to take: Wait till the entire situation gets

-unbearable, then acknowledge it as a problem and promise to take

steps to solve the problem. The efforts by the police are appreciated,
but hardly commended.

The bottom line is that the situation should have been recognized
long ago and taken care of before it got out of hand. If a campus
newspaper can recognize a growing problem on the city streets, and
the city police can't until after the fact, something is definitely wrong.

Pitt students learned several valuable lessons last weekend. One,
don't wear gold chains on Forbes Avenue. And two, it doesn't mat-
ter whether you are male or female, don't—wa|k home alone.

With increased police patrol, maybe this weekend will be better.

President Reagan

takes strong stand

On Monday, Sept. 22, Ronald Reagan addressed the United Na-
tions General Assembly. He spoke for 37 minutes, which was rather
short considering the range of topics he covered.

Reagan has been accused in the past of understating the current
state of affairs in the world, but Monday's speech was different. He
spoke plainly and openly. He told the Soviets, the Nicaraguans and
the Angolans that he wasn't pleased with the way they conducted
their foreign affairs. He accused the Soviets of expanding their sphere
of influence through force, whether it be in their own country or
abroad. He told the assembly that the United States will not tolerate
terrorism, and he proudly displayed our actions in Libya as proof of
that fact.

Whether or not you approve of Reagan or his policies is not the
point here. The point is that he stood up to the General Assembly.
He upheld our honor as a nation before the whole world, a welcome
change. President Reagan exemplified the ”new American spirit.”
We are beginning to stop feeling responsible for world problems.
We're beginning to look out for ourselves. Most importantly, no coun-
try is going to take advantage of us.

For a long time, the United Nations has been a hotbed of anti-
American sentiment and action even though U.N. headquarters is
located on our shores. If nothing else, the Reagan administration has

_proven to the United Nations that they are dependent upon us,

regardless, and that is a step in the right direction.

The assembly received the president somewhat coldly. Never once
was he interrupted during the course of his address by applause,
which is generally taken to be a sure sign of lack of enthusiasm on
the part of the audience. As was expected, our allies were receptive
to him in the end, and the countries who don't support our efforts
weren't. Reagan knew this would be the case before he spoke, but
it didn't stop him, nor did it inhibit him.‘

There's a chance that his speech will further inflame US? and Soviet
relations, but at least the whole world knows where we stand.

Forbes is out of control

Since school started, and not
before this, one of the worst situa-
tions has arisen on our campus. The

. best way to describe it is to tell the

events that occurred around me on
Saturday night around midnight.

As I walked down Forbes Avenue
towards the Towers, the sidewalks on
both sides were overflowing with
scores upon scores of high school-
aged youths loitering and causing
criminal mischief. Within the
distance from King's Court Theater to
C.J_. Barney's, three criminal actions
took place in a time span of five
minutes. First, a group of girls pulled
the hair of another passing girl until
she almost fell over. Next, a youth
ripped a gold chain off of a passer-
by’s neck; however, he was ap-
prehended and cuffed by city police.
Lastly, the same incident occurred in
front of C.J. Barney's, only this time
the little punk escaped.

This situation has been previously
addressed in The Pitt News, however
not enough significant action has
been taken by the university or city

. police. Undoubtedly, one of these in-

cidents will set off a confrontation
that will end in personal injury or
worse. Therefore, since using nerve
gas on ..these roaches may be the
slightest bit too harsh for the situa-
tion, a strongly implemented no
loitering mandate should be enforced
by the city and campus police forces.

If this is not done soon, these lit-
tle, ignorant hoodlums will claim this
area [as] their gang's turf —

In defense of free

It is funny that by trying to be con-
scious of a certain morality, namely
Jeffersonian metaphysics, writerstere
constantly apologizing for their con-
flict with popular politics and forced
to reassert their Americanness. Even
Adam Eisenstat, last semester's most
controversial columnist in The Pitt
News, would, when criticizing our
government's antipathy for freedom
of speech, end up with statements
which sounded almost like loyalty
oaths.

In keeping with this trend, let me
announce a loyalty oath of my own.
Human beings are born free. Jeffer-
son actually created a government
designed to keep us free. So long as
we are free, we will defend those
principles. Nevertheless, when we
cannot choose our own ways of
defending our freedom, we are hence
no longer free. The strange, rhetorical
constructions of Ronald Reagan not-
withstanding, those who speak free-

Since my first day at Pitt, I've
wondered about our administration.
I've questioned its reasoning only
because some of the decisions
they've made make no sense to me.
The latest example is the issue be-
tween the Greek Week committee
and the administration about a wres-
tling event in the Field House. It is
my understanding that the event

_ would raise substantial funds for the

Greek Week charity, and it would be
great PR for both the adminstration
and the Greeks. But we can't have it.

Why? Well, somebody has given
the excuse that the Field House may

ly defend freedom; those who resist
militancy and coercion defend
freedom.

Last night at the Upstage, someone
who had been reading my columns
approached me and told me with as
concerned an expression as my
mother might wear, that she was
scared that ”they" were going to hurt
me. This was because I had defend-
ed Adam Eisenstat publicly with
some very controversial remarks.

Let me just state one of these for
you. I was told that Adam had no
business defending the creation of
pornographic art under the heading
of free speech because "the founding
fathers hadn't really intended us to
have speech quite that free.” To this
I had remarked, sarcastically, that the

not hold a professional sporting
event, but how can anybody in their
right mind think that? Pro-wrestling
is entertainment; the promoter
describes his league as an entertain-
ment company! C'mon, how can you
consider pro-wrestling a sport when
the athletes have a script to follow?
Obviously, (hopefully), our ad-
ministration has more common sense
than this, so that can't be the
reasoning.

Well, then, what could be the
reasoning? Is the administration afraid
of a rowdy crowd? How much more
difficult can it be to control this
crowd as compared to the Farrakhan
or basketball crowds? With such
diligent and intimidating campus
police, what is there to worry about?
Okay, you're right, let's rent some of
the big O’s security guards to back
them up.

Well, now that we got that settled,
"what could possibly be the excuse for
not allowing the event? I hope that
the ‘Greeks are not being denied
simply because they are Greeks. It
would be unforgivable to deny the
Hamarville Rehabilitation Center of

possibly ’$I0,000 simply because

there may exist ill feelings between
the Greeks and the administation.
Well, I still haven't found any
reasonable excuses; I kind of doubt
that any exist. I'm sure that if the ad-
ministation were willing, they'd sure-
ly find a way, but what do I know?

speech

founding fathers no doubt had in-
tended us to build the bomb, strafe
Vietnamese villages and ignore the
crimes of militant Ethiopia.

She smiled, still concerned, and
said that she hoped I would temper
those remarks, because it was
something people couldn't under-
stand. So here, let me say in truth and
without sarcasm, that freedom of
speech includes the right to say things
that people don't understand.

The absurdity of criticizing as be-
ing un-American those who criticize
their government is a sample of the
most awful fratricidal tendencies.-We
might as well call Reagan un-
American for selling our country
down the river of belligerence and
coercion. When statesmen refuse to
force mercy upon nations and to
struggle for justifiable peace, then the
task falls upon poets and
newspapermen. Let's not be so
ungracious about it.

Move over Jane,here comes Pat Boone!

I have in my possession a truly
shocking videotape.

As many times as I have played it,
I stillcannot believewhat I am see-
ing on the screen.

The videotape is not pornographic
or violent; quite the opposite._|t is an
exercise videotape —— an exercise
videotape designed for ”mature
adults,” which is the polite way of
saying ”old people.”

I'm sure many of you recall Boone
crooning such hits as ”Love Letters
in the Sand” and ”April Love” while
girls in the audience screamed and
swooned. I happened to go to danc-
ing school with one girl who got in
trouble with her parents; she slept on
a Pat Boone pillowcase, and her folks
thought it was outrageous that her
face should touch the image of a
male singer all night long.

But now, it turns out, Pat Boone is
52. He is a grandfather 11 times over.
And he is working out for all the
world to see on the Take Time With

Inexperienceisn’t healthy for relationships”

Q. I am 78 and I was a virgin until
a month ago when I went to bed with
a man 20 years older because I loved
him and he seemed to be crazy about
me. Also, we were a little stoned. He
never called me, so two weeks later
I called him. He was glad to hear
from me, but didn't call after that. I
know you'll say to wash that man
right out of my hair, but I can't. I'll
never get over him — never.

A. OK, I see that you are in no con-
dition to hear that advice. 50, instead
suppose you try something else: Tell
your story to someone you can trust
-— a favorite aunt or close friend,
someone who will listen and keep an
eye on you for a while. Because even
if you soak your pillow with tears at
night, you still need someone a little
more responsive.

Now, think about this. You will
never forget him. Your heart is per-
manently broken, I agree. But you
will go on like that for a while and
then one day the sun will shine and
you will notice it. A bird will chirp
and you'll hear it. You'll have a mo-
ment of human happiness, and

Halftime

Being the loyal Pitt student that I
am, I watched the mighty Panthers
devour the Boilermakers on Saturday
afternoon._ It was great fun to watch
Pitt finally win one.

The game was broadcast by WTBS,
and aside from the fact that the an-
nouncers couldn't get the players’
names right, the coverage was pret-
ty good.

However, the cameraman must
have had some hormonal distur-
bance, because every time there was
a lull in the action, he would pan
over to show us some of Purdue's
finest co-eds. I don't particularly mind
watching pretty girls eat soft pretzels,
but being the liberated '80s man that
I am, I couldn't help but be irked.
This gentleman didn't stop at the girls
in the stands either; he showed us in-
tense close-ups of Purdue's answer to
our Golden Girls and some fairly
compromising shots of the cheer-
leaders.

I started thinking. This is exploita-
tion, and I wondered who was to
blame. Immediately, I pointed the
finger at the cameraman. But as I
thought about it more, I realized that
he is only doing his job. He's trying

Pat Boone tape.

A Florida exercise expert named
Connie Letney joins Boone on the
tape, but Boone is clearly the star.
Behind Boone and Letney are about
a dozen ”mature adults,” all of them
following Boone's dips and gyrations.
The exercises, I might add, are all
rather slow-paced and ginger.

I kept watching the tape, not be-
lieving my eyes, and finally I did the
only logical thing: I called Pat Boone.

”Excuse me," he said, coughing. ’’I
had a bran muffin a few minutes ago,
and some of the bran must have
lodged in my throat.”

He said that he felt perfectly natural
making an exercise tape for ”mature
adults.”

”|’ve been an exercise nut my
whole life,” he said. ”I started in
grade school and never quit. Right
now I weigh only five pounds more
than I did when I graduated from high

school. When people ask me how I ’

another one and another. Your heart
will still be broken, but you will find
life still has something in it. '

And let me tell you something:
Everywhere you see people smiling
and laughing, and 93.2 percent of
them have broken hearts. Think
about that. And please, if you do
something for love, be sure the other
person isn't just stoned or looking for
sexual release.

Q. She seems to go for me, but I ’m
wary of her. I think she may expect
too much. I’m inexperienced with
women and she seems confident and
with it. I don’t want to be compared
with more experienced guys.

A. We all have self-protective feel-
ings, which are not always wrong, by
any means. _But sometimes a guy is
sure the girl is experienced and has
had at least a dozen great lovers in
her past, when the fact is her ex-

perience is limited. ,

of the audience was male, and a
good way to keep male attention is
to show scantily" clad women. I
started to blame the women for al-
lowing themselves to become sex
toys, but it’s not their fault either -
people will do what they are permit-
ted, if not encouraged, to do. Besides,
they get to be on national TV and say
”hi" to their mothers. I guess the
blame rests on our society. It's a pret-
ty sad commentary on our ”|iberated
society” when women "are not only
permitted, but are encouraged to
become entertainment at football
games. What purpose do baton girls
and the like serve at football games
other than to be something pretty to

and it sets back the women's move-
ment hundreds of years. All of the ad-
vances women have made are
cheapened every time a young lady
dons a tiny, sequined uniform and
gyrates in front of a cameraman.

It's almost comic. Women are
always wailing because men regard
them as little more than slabs of meat
sometimes. Women want to gain
respect for their abilities and to be
considered our equals. I would like
to see that happen, too. But as long

Boone said that when the
videotape company approached him,
they suggested that the exercise tape
be marketed for men and women 50
and older. ’’I- disagree with that
marketing plan,” Boone said. ”I think

He admitted that the exercises on
the tape are a bit more subdued than
on other best-selling exercise videos
aimed at younger audiences. ”Even
our music is different,” he said.

”Most exercise tapes have disco—type .

IS more soothing. We have a trio —
drums, bass and a piano.”

He is not satisfied with the way he
looks in the video. ”I wore the wrong

and a medium. The medium felt too
snug. I [gained] a little bit of extra
weight on my love handles on the
sides, so I chose the large tank top.
But I feel it makes me look less fit

He admits that he has some trep-
idation about what the tape may do

”|’ve been approached many times
about doing promotions for

said. ”I’m not ashamed of being a

This baton girl thing confuses me. ‘

The women in my classes tell me
they're my equals. I wholeheartedly
agree. The women I date tell me that

they want to be treated like ladies, *

and they demand that I open doors
for them, so I do. The women ex-
hibiting themselves to me at football
games are in fact saying, ”I’m a sex
object; drool over me.” I'm hesitant
to admit it, but I sometimes find saliva
on the front of my shirt. How about
a little consistence, ladies? Pick one
of your roles, and stick to it. Women
don't seem to be confused about how
to treat men, but try and find a guy
who's not perplexed by the feminine
mystique. Open a door for somebody
and you'll either get slapped and
called a chauvinist, or you'll get un-

There is a dilemma creeping across the
nation as to how college students are going
to pay for tuition. A couple of ‘months ago
President Reagan suggested that college
students need to work more to pay what
loans and grants couldn't handle.

Most students simply sighed.

Finding a way to pay for tuition and
things like the beer that make college life
bearable was becoming a tough order.

Carnegie Mellon student Paul D’Alessan-
dris has found a way.

He was flipping through the CMU Tartan
(the student newspaper) and found ‘an ad

 about scholarships from Coors beer —

$2,000 a year to be exact. He applied for
and received a scholarship.

”l’ve heard some jokes from friends
about how they're going to give the
scholarship in beer,” said the senior
physics major. ”When you go to a place

 like CMU, you have to take money
3 wherever you can get it.”

The Adolph Coors Company, based in

" " Golden, Colo., started the program two

_ years ago. It is called the Coors Veterans
— Memorial Scholarship Fund and offers

. money to students whose parents have

served in the armed forces.

Coors spokeswomen Colleen Plummer
takes the scholarship very seriously.

"We've been working with veterans for a
long -time,” she said. ”With this program,
the brewery puts up $500,000 which is
spread among the sons and daughters of
veterans. It's been a very successful pro-
gram.”

She seemed not to see any correlation
between beer and college. Not to mention
humor. ‘

’ D’A||essandris said his father served in
the army in the early '50s. He felt it was
kind of add at first that a beer company
would offer a scholarship. ”l think that's
why they pulled in the veterans,” he said.

In order to qualify, an applicant must
have a 2.75 QPA or better and must write
a 50-word essay on the major he or she
has chosen.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 24, 1986

Plummer said more than 6,000 people
applied for the award this year, and 123
were granted. Included injthis were 20
seniors, 36 juniors and 67 sophomores.
The seniors will receive a one-year scholar-
ship totaling $2,000; juniors will receive a
two-year scholarship totaling $3,500; and
sophomores will receive a three-year
scholarship totaling $5,000.

It's almost disappointing to know that no
one from the company is actually screening
the applicants. The vision of sweaty
brewery workers rolling up their sleeves on
a lunch break deciding where company
money is going is quite entertaining.”

To Plummer it's not all that entertaining,
or remotely realistic. .

’’All applicants are screened by an ad-
ministrator of the program in Washington,
D.C.,” she said.

The University of Missouri leads the na-
tion in students receiving Coors Beer
scholarships. All four of those awarded in
that state went to students there. Penn-
sylvania tied with Florida, lllinois and
Texas for most awards in a state.

It's a little surprising because the beer
isn't even legally distributed here.

Coors scholarship unites studying and beer

”We hope to go national by 1990,” said
Plummer. ’’If you see our beer in Penn-
sylvania, it’s not because we-brought it
there.” 3 ‘ ‘

She said distributors of the beer in other
states raised over $530,000 to award local
scholarships to dependents of veterans or to
support local veteran organizations. This
was in addition to the money the company
itself raised.

if you don't have to be a resident of a
state where the beer is distributed, do you
at least have to like the taste of the stuff?

According to Plummer, you don't, and
there's no question on the application
about the beer itself.

D’Al|essandris said he has tried Coors but
doesn't drink it regularly. He didn't men-
tion any particular preference either.

”No, I'm not a fan of Coors,” he said.
’’It’s nothing to write home about.”

Noreen Doloughty is the only other Pitts-
burgh area. student who received a scholar-
ship. She attends La Roche college.

Plummer didn't know if anyone from Pitt
had applied for the scholarship, though she
certainly encouraged the idea. The scholar-
ship is open to all majors.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 24, I986

Career Fair presents

By Matthew Thornton and
Beth Bijak

The Pitt News

The most common answer to the
question, ”What are you going to do
when you graduate?” seems to be, ”I
don't know, I uh, hum, ah,” etc. This
week, students have a chance to
develop a more literate answer to that
question.

The 1986 Career Seminar series
began on Monday in the William Pitt
Union Assembly Room. Two more
seminars, held today and tomorrow
from 1 to 4 p.m. will complete the
program. The series is entitled
”Where Are You Going?" ~— a ques-
tion the seminar may help , many
students answer.

Each day, over 50 local and na-
tional organizations are represented.
Students are able to speak informal-

ly with representatives in their fields I

of interest.

Most of the representatives are
from companiesand organizations
that are regular participants in this an-
nual series. This year, however, many
newcomers joined, enhancing the
variety and content of the program.

Monday's seminar, which focused
on business, industry and com-
munications, will be repeated on
Thursday. Included in the long list of
participating organizations were the
U.S. Navy, Mellon Bank, Bell of
Pennsylvania and American
Cablevision.

On Tuesday, government, law and
public service were featured.
Representatives at the conference
had common goals and expectations
for the seminar. Most of them ex-
pressed an interest in letting students
know what career choices are
available.

”Students can get fresh ideas here.

"It [the seminar] channels them into

careers they might not have known

were there,” said Robert Edison, an
official with the National Labor Rela-
tions Board.

”Pitt doesn't have a cooperative
education program, and this gives the
students insight into the real world.
They learn what the jobs are really
Iike.”

Edison said that he would like to
see more freshmen and sophomores
at the program.

”They [freshmen] could benefit
most from the information we have,”
said Edison. ”The upperclassmen

have already completed the bulk of
their courses and are trying to find

employment. Sometimes, they're not

”The younger students could gain
a lot from programs like this. They
would have the opportunity to find
out what the real requirements for
their intended field of study are.”

Today, representatives from fields
in health, education and social ser-
vices will be in attendance. Among
them are the American Red Cross,
Children's Hospital and the American
Cancer Society.

In addition to tomorrow's seminar,
there will be an hour-long workshop
called ”Power Communication: How

senior vice president of Drake, Beam

on procedures for presenting
themselves successfully in interviews.

Linda Orday, a student coordinator
present at the seminar, said that the
series was designed to help students
decide on a career goal and the ma-
jor course of study needed to reach
that goal.

By Maria Ritz

For The Pitt News

While many of us were taking a

break from the books this summer,’

one Pitt senior was studying diligent-
ly atperhaps the_most prestigious
university in the world: Oxford.

Kristy Kolesar of _McKeesport
received the Rachel McMasters Hunt
Award last spring through the Na-
tionality Rooms-sponsored schol-
arships.

Kolesar’s accomplishments include-

presidency of her industrial engineer-
ing class and ofAlpha Pi Mu, the Na-
tional lndustrial Engineering Honor
Society. She is also a member of Tau
Beta Pi, the National Engineering
Honor Society. ’

With the $1,500 scholarship came
the opportunity to choose any institu-
tion in the world in which to study
economics, Kolesar’s field of concen-
tration.

’’I knew I wanted to study at Ox-
ford University, but getting into such
a well-known school would be dif-
ficult,” Kolesar said. "I went through
a lot of frustration in contacting an
American affiliate for Oxford.”

No Oxford blues

Five intense weeks of study  

Once‘ she was accepted by
Southern Methodist University's
SMU—in-Oxford program, Kolesar
was on her way to England's most
famous college.

Kolesar attended University Col-
lege, affectionately called ”Univ” by
Oxonians. The oldest of the 36 col-

leges within the Oxford network, _
Univ was established in 1249.

‘ 

You realize you're at
this amazing school
with such a great
history. Traditions are
so important to
everyone here.

—Kristy Kolesar

”Each of the 36 [colleges] is very
individualized with its own set of
rules, activities and reputation,”

dorms, a ch_apel and dining hall com-
prises each college. According to
Kolesar, the city of Oxford is built
around the university, similar to the
situation in Oakland.

Kolesar attended classes in interna-
tional finance and modern British
economy within Univ. The tutorial
system of study,’ one aspect of her
course requirement, is a well-
respected Oxford tradition. The
students metrwith a tutor individual-
ly each week to make _a presentation
on a topic they had researched and
written a paper on.

”The most important thing I
learned from my tutorials was how
to think,” Kolesar said. ”You don't
learn by memorizing facts. You have
to compare and contrast; know the
background.”

Kolesar recalled the stress of talk-
ing one-on-one with her professor for
an hour. ”You can't hide ifyou don't
know the material. You have to be
prepared." Nonetheless, Kolesar was
thoroughly impressed by the system
and stressed the helpful methods ‘of
the tutor. ”He doesn't try to make
you look foolish; He finds your weak

points and encourages you to
strengthen them by steering you in
the right direction.”

Successfully completing her final
exams, Kolesar came away from an
intense five weeks of study in favor
of the British system, which she said
is more thorough and permanent.

"You don't forget what you've
learned the minute you walk out of
the exam room. And finals are easier
to prepare for because the knowledge
is already there,” Kolesar explained.

Kolesar was required, along with
the other mostly American summer
students, to attend lectures twice a
week. Among the famed speakers
were former British Prime Minister Rt.
Hon. Lord Wilson of Rievaulx, Parlia-
ment's Lord Hanworth, and Count
Nickolai Tolstoy, author and descen-
dant of Leo Tolstoy.

The courses also included visits to
Lloyd's Bank, the London Stock Ex-
change, the Bank of England and
other financial institutions.

Kolesar received a certificate from
the Bodleian Library to give to Mayor
Caliguiri in'thanks for the book on

Pittsburgh that was given to the_

library. She will meet with Caliguiri
at an upcoming press conference.

While attending Oxford, Kolesar
stayed in a private room within the
Univ. ”The dorm rooms were beau-
tiful with fine woodwork, as [exem-
pified by the] fireplace, sitting room
and window seat," she said.

Meals were served to the students
in an ornate dining hall after the
faculty, who sat at the"’high table,”
recited Latin prayers. Dinners re-
quired that men wear a suit and tie,
and that women wear a dress or skirt.

Tea time is observed at 4 o'clock

by the Oxonians, as in all of England. -

Kolesar remembered, ”That was real-
ly fattening with all the scones and
whipped cream.”

In the afternoons, students often
went punting along the Cherwell
River. This popular Oxford sport in-
volves propelling a flat boat with a
long stick while standing up.

Group trips which took the
students to many famous places were
arranged on weekends. They visited
Stonehenge, Windsor Castle, Strat-
ford on Avon, Bath, Wales and Sal-
isbury Cathedral. They even took a
look at ”the other place," as Oxo-

nians call their rival university, Cam-
bridge.

Another favorite weekend activity
of the study—weary students is ”pub
crawling.” But even in recreation, the
learning never ended for Kolesar.

”lt’s very different at the pubs in
England because it's more intellec-
tual,” she said. ”Everyone talks about
politics, current events and theology.

I You learn to develop your own view

points.”

Kolesar noted that rules at Oxford
are stricter than at Pitt. For example,
Oxonians must abide by a midnight
curfew (2 a.m. on weekends). At the
strict Bodleian Library, students must
take an oath to obtain a library card.

Most promineht was the spirit and

pride at Oxford. ”You walk around .

these buildings that are hundreds of
years old and hear chimes every
hour,” Kolesar said. ”You realize
you're at this amazing school with
such a great history. Traditions are so
important to everyone here.”

’’I learned so much when I was
abroad, not only in the classroom.
You have to be assertive and respect
other cultures. It was an unforgettable
summer, and I miss Oxford already,”
Kolesar said.‘

The two roommates organized a

they went in the Towers, asking pet}

they met eight people who told them
they were robbed or attacked, and
had 12 witnesses backing them up.

Five students at the meeting said
they reported incidents to the cam-

they couldn't do anything about it.
, ”The campus police [weren't]

they were they didn't help much.

Barb Jackson, a Pitt freshman at-

Disorderly Conduct: _Four
juveniles were arrested in the 200
block of Meyran Avenue on Satur-

with another who was not ap-
prehended, were involved in a
fight with John Beerhalter in the

Beerhalter sustained an injury to
the left eye when he was assaulted
by the youth who escaped. The
five youths had been told earlier
to leave the Oakland area for har-
rassing people onthe street.‘

Disorderly Conduct: Two
youths were being loud and dis-

in the area of Fifth Avenue and
DeSoto Street. When told to dis-
perse, they refused the order and
became loud and abusive. The
two were then cited for disorder-
ly conduct.

Assault and Robbery: Charles

' Moff, a Carnegie Mellon‘Univer-

robbed by a group of 10-12 black

males on Sunday at approximately
12:30 a.m. The assault took place
on the corner of Fifth Avenue and

Jackson said the group walked
away after a while, throwing globs of
melted cheese from an Oakland
restaurant at them. She said they
found campus police and told them
about the incident.

”Campus police just walked us
back inside the Towers, and they
didn't do anything about the inci-
dent,” she said.

Susanna Frazier, a Pitt freshman,
said she had a gold necklace torn

from her neck Saturday night.

”We heard about a friend of ours
and her boyfriend getting beaten up
by a bunch of black people in front
of the Towers on Fifth Avenue,” she
said. ”We wanted to get something
to eat,‘ so we decided it would be
safer to go out the Forbes Avenue

"When we got down to Forbes

males telling us ’we knocked down
that white boy and white girl,’ ” she

said.

”We walked by them, and two
black guys followed me and ripped
two gold chains off of my neck. They
just walked away. I went to a cam-
pus policeman across the street
screaming for help, and he chased
the guy and arrested him.

”The campus policeman told me
the only reason he was able to help
me was because I screamed and it
was obvious I needed help,” she
said.

Students call for better campus police protection

Kolesar said two people attended

" the meeting but wished to remain

nameless.

”They are a freshman couple. They
were‘ walking from a bus across Fifth
Avenue to the Towers Saturday night
when 15 or 20 black guys surround-
ed them. One guy from the group
punched the student in the face said
he was sorry,” she said.

”He then asked if the student was
all right and then he and the rest of
them started beating on him.‘ Some-
body knocked his girlfriend down
and tried to take her purse, but she
wouldn't let go.

”They dragged her around by her
purse,” she said.

Afterward, the couple called cam-
pus police and the police said there
was nothing they could do about it,

‘according to Kolesar.

Michelle, a freshman, asked that

her last name not be printed. She said

_ she was walking past The Original

Hot Dog Shop around midnight

15)

when a number of people began to 

close in around them.
"They didn't look like students,

_ they were either too old or too

young,” she said. ”And all the peo-
ple who surrounded us were black.

”This guy came up and ripped my
‘necklace off my neck. Then a black
girl started pulling my hair and
laughing. I finally pulled away from
her and riped the chain out of the
guy's hand.

”Campus police said they couldn't

do anything until the Pittsburgh

Police got there because it was out
of their-jurisdiction,” she said.

Keith Barsky, a Pitt freshman, had -

a chain stolen from him also that
night. ’

”l was in front of the Original
around 12:15 a.m. when some black
guy came up to me and grabbed my
chain right off my neck. I looked all
around for a cop and I couldn't find
one,” he said. -

Rummel said the university should
spend more money to protect the

B students.

”They are spending so much
money on putting new shrubbery on
the Cathedral Lawn to_ make the cam-
pus look nice,” Rummel said.

”But those administrators don't
know what goes on here at night. The
campus may look nice, but they're
not putting enough into protecting
the students,” she continued.

Frazier said the situation was one
she never had seen before.

’’I don't know what got into all
those people. It seemed like they
were trying to start a riot,” she said.

THE PITT NEWS

Gottfried
making
moves

By John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt Panthers are a team walk-
ing on the edge as they prepare for
Saturday's backyard brawl with the
West Virginia Mountaineers.

Because of numerous injuries, Pitt's
already thin depth chart seems to be
getting even thinner every week. In
last Saturday's 41-26 victory over Pur-
due, the Panthers lost one of the most
vital members of the squad, wide
receiver Reggie Williams, to a broken
fibula. Williams, who has caught 17
passes for 239 yards in Pitt's firsfthree
games, will be sidelined for four to
six weeks. ”We lost a big part of our
offense when we lost Reggie
Williams,” said Pitt coach Mike Gott-
fried. ”At the pace he was going, he
would havecaught 80 or 85 passes
this season."

The loss ofWi|liams leaves the Pitt
receiving corps in deep trouble. The
Panthers now have only two ex-
perienced and healthy wide
receivers, senior Chuck Scales and
junior Michael Stewart. What makes
that even more of a concernis that

’ Stewart and Scales have combined

for only 10 catches this season.

Scales, Pitt's leading receiver last
season, has been a disappointment so
far, and Stewart has been bothered
by a shoulder injury.

Pitt quarterback John Congemi’s
statistics this season — 64 comple-
tions in 112 attempts for 657 yards
—- are evidence for ‘Gottfried’s pro-
pensity to pass. But to be successful
in that type of offense, Pittneeds five
or six capable receivers. This is
because Gottfried often likes to use
four receivers at a time in numerous
plays.

The Panthers’ other -receivers,
sophomore Billy Osborn and
freshmen Darrin Gillaspie and Hosea
Heard lack game experience. Osborn
was converted from defensive back
in spring camp, while Gillaspie and
Heard have only four catches be-

tween them this season.
However, Heard caught three

passes for 35 yards in his first col.-

Running back Charles Gladman (abovel, may find himself on the bench for the first
time since his freshman year during this week's West Virginia game. Gottfried has
not said who will start at tailback this week, but he has indicated Craig ”lronhead”
Heyward will get more playing time this week than he has in Pitt's first three games.

Gottfried said yesterday at Pitt's weekly media luncheon he would not finalize this
week's lineup until Thursday.

Backyard
brawl
agai n

By Tom Danyluk
Staff Writer ~

”What’s that ya say, Elmer? The
Mountaineers are getting into a foot-
ball game with the ‘Pitt Panthers’?
Well, them’s fightin’ words!”

Maybe not a fair example of a con-
versation heard in Mountaineerland,
even though the Panther faithful like
to think so, but yes, it's that time of
the year again. Pittsburgh versus West
Virginia, in an all-out battle for an-
nual supremacy of, er, um, the
Allegheny Mountains? Well whatever
the stakes, there is no love, friendship
or casual acquaintance between
these two football teams, let alone
their respective fans. After -last
season's 10-10 draw at Mountaineer
Field, emotions, this time around,
should be wilder than an evening of
bluegrass, side chaw and corn
whiskey.

The Mountaineers come into Pitt
Stadium owning a 2-1 slate. Coach
Don Neh|en’s troops opened with a
47-14 rout of Northern Illinois, then
squeaked by East Carolina before be-
ing toppled by a fine Maryland unit
last Saturday, 24-3. WVU has a
relatively experienced team, one with
13 returning starters and an addi-
tional 25 lettermen. Their quarter-
back is 6-2 junior Mike Timko, who
is blessed with a fabulous arm and
good field sense. In the backfield
behind Timko await a number of'ex—
cellent running backs, including John
Holifield, Undra Johnson and Chris
Peccon. Junior speedster John Talley
leads the young receiving corps.

Up front, the Mountaineers are
huge and quick, par usual. Despite
the loss of monster Brian Jozwiak to
the NFL, the offensive line doesn't
often oblige readily to charging
defenses. A pair of 6-3 plus guards,
Bob Kovach and John Stroia, anchor
the wall protecting Timko.

As for the defense, Pitt can expect
the usual punishing Nehlen-style.
The defensive line, consisting of Brad
Hunt, David Grant and Jeff Lucas, is
outstanding, to say the least. All three
are over 275 pounds and are ex-
cellent pass rushers. The linebackers

A not—so—in-depth look at the baseball playoffs

Here it is late September, sports
fans, and the pennant races are real-
ly heating up. The question on the
mind of every sports fanin North
America burns bright this fall:

Will the Pirates catch the Cubs for
fifth place in the National League
East?

Actually, l can't stand it when there
aren't any pennant races. It makes for
a very boring September. So in the
interest of keeping you reminded of
the Grand Ole Game, I hereby an-
nounce my Official 1986 Major
League Baseball Post-Season
Predictions.

National League East — The Mets
clinched the division on Memorial‘
Day, and having been long bored
with baseball, they have taken to
beating people up. Whether its other
teams, hotel guests or the Houston
Police Department, the Mets are
always fighting somebody. There is
no truth to the rumor, however, that
Ron Darling and Tim Teufel will take
on Mike Tyson in a heavywieght ti-
tle fight to be broadcast live on HBO.
Negotiaions between Sid Fernandez
and Joe Frazier are continuing.

The Mets have the best everyday

lineup in Major League baseball.
They are solid from top to bottom;
Gary Carter and Keith Hernandez are
probably the best all-around players
at their positions in the National
League. The Mets are so good they
could use whiffle ball bats and still
beat most of the teams they play. And
how about that pitching staff, huh?
Any team that combines a 21-year-
old superstar, a Hawaiian and an Ivy
Leaguer can't be bad. Besides all that,
Lee,Mazzi||i was born to play for the
Mets. Now if only Tom Seaver could
come back.

National League West — The
Houston Astros held off the San Fran-
cisco Giants and charges by the Cin-
cinnati Reds and Los Angeles
Dodgers to all but wrap up the Na-
tional League West Division.
Everybody knows, of course, that the
Astros have the best uniforms in pro-
fessional sports. They look like they
pulled them out ofa Houston softball
league warehouse. The Astros have
Mike Scott, Glenn Davis and; bunch
of guys nobody has ever heard of.
Somehow they have managed to
win. Nobody knows how, but they

 

have.

So now.the Mets will play the
Astros. The Astros will have trouble
hitting the Mets’ pitching, except for
Davis, of course, who could be the
next Mike Schmidt. The Mets will
have trouble hitting the Astros and
the Houston Police Department.

Prediction — New York Mets in
five games.

American League East — Those
perennial Chokers, theBoston Red
Sox, have finally done it. For the first

son rnnvans

time _since 1975 they will be the AL
East champs. The most amazing thing
of all is that the Red Sox have done
it with pitching. Roger Clemens is the
new wonderboy of the mound, blow-
ing down hitters all year and
establishing the new Major League
record for stikeouts in a game.

Clemens isn't the only good pitcher
on the Red Sox staff. There is also
Tom Seaver and America's favorite
funny man, Dennis ”Oil Can” Boyd.
The Red Sox looked like the team of
the century much of the season but
in August lost a good chunk of their
lead to the Yankees and Blue Jays.

Everybody thought the Red Sox
would fold, but they showed they are
a team of great intestinal fortitude,
strong character and all-around swell
guys in holding on for the division
championship.

American League West — The
California Angels are the winners
here: They beat out the Texas
Rangers, who finally have a good hit-
ter and decent uniforms. It's been a
good summer in Texas.

The Angels are led by first baseman
Wally Joyner, the guy they're calling
”the best rookie since Moses," the

Old Testament one, not Malone. The
Angels also have Don Sutton, who is
only a few years older than Moses but
who still has a good curveball.

The Red Sox's biggest problem in
playing the Angels will be getting
over jet lag.

Prediction —- The Red Sox in four.

World Series — The New York
Mets vs. the Boston Red Sox. Ooh,
it makes your mouth water. This
should be a classic Fall Classic, with
games full of home _runs, great
pitching and snow delays. The one
thing the Red Sox will have to be
careful of is the_Shea Stadium crowd,
which seems to think that running
across the field after the game is the
best way to leave the ball park.

The fans will not be the Boston
Nine’s only difficulty. The Mets’
pitching staff is the best that has been
assembled on one team since the
Baltimore Orioles’ staffs of the early
1970s. The Red Sox hitting will not
be enough to beat the Mets. That is
what the series will come down to,
and that is why the New York Mets
will be the 1986 World Series
champs. ' ‘

Or mavbe not.

Women

to play
tourney

By Kelley Butt

Sta ff Writer

 

The Lady Panther volleyball team
leaves for the Florida Invitational to-
day. As they take to the court Friday
night, the team will look to improve
a 9-3 record. Pitt will face tough
teams from Florida, Texas and Iowa.
Coach Collier believes the Lady Pan-
thers’ success in the Pitt Classic pro-
vided a boost in confidence. Being
able to win a game off seventh-
ranked Santa Barbara played a major
role in this upswing in attitude.
Although Florida, Texas and Iowa
don't have Santa Barbara's prestige,
they will be tough competition.

Louise O’Shaughnessey noted,
”We’re playing high calibre teams
this weekend, but we should play
three really strong matches. We
worked really hard in summer camp,
and we're continuing to work.‘ I think
it's starting to pay off now.”

Friday night Pitt plays the Big Ten’s
Iowa Hawkeyes. This is a significant
matchup for the 6-1 Hawkeyes as

' they also near the top of their con-
ference. Saturday, Houston will take
on the Lady Panthers. Coming out of
the Southwest Conference, Houston
is nationally respected this year. Host
Florida, of the Southeast Conference,
plays Pitt Saturday night. The SEC is
one of the top conferences for volley-
ball in the nation. Florida is one of
the strongest teams this year.

Coach Collier pointed out, ”Whi|e
we really don't have any scouting in-
formation on any of these teams, we
know that we have our work cut oLIt

ourselves. We are also representing

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 24, I986

 Klausing, kicking coach,

looking for some answers

By John W. McNulty

For The Pitt News

For those of you who know Chuck
Klausing, assistant head football
coach at Pitt, this could be a trip
down memory lane. For those of you
who don’t know of him, or his many
accomplishments, you will probably
come away with a better look at a
man who has devoted his life to his
family, church and countless young
athletes.

Coach Klausing attended Wilmer-
ding High School where he excelled
as an offensive lineman and was
selected on the Pennsylvania All-
State football team. After graduation
from high school, Klausing attended
Penn State and played center for two
years under head coach Bob Higgins.

While Klausing was at Penn State,
war was declared and he went into
the Marine Corps as a second lieu-
tenant. He commanded a line pla-
toon in the Pacific and was on
Okinawa-' when the war ended.
Klausing was one of those rare breeds
that interrupted his education to serve
his country.

Klausing returned and enrolled at
Slippery Rock where he graduated in
1948. In that very same year, Klaus-
ing began what has come to be an

illustrious coaching career.
Taking a job at Pitcairn High
School, Klausing led his charges to

a 30-7-1 record from 1948 to 1953. ~

In '53 he went to Braddock High
School and in seven years led his
teams to six W'PlAL championships
and a phenomonal 55—game winning
streak.

Klausing then made his move into
the college ranks when he took a job
as freshman coach at Rutgers Univer-
sity in New Jersey. After leaving
Rutgers he went to the Military
Academy at West Point and was an
assistant coach to the legendary Paul
Dietzel at Army.

Klausing then went to Indiana State
Teachers College, now known as
IUP, and once again he compiled
some impressive statistics as head
coach of the ”lndians.” K|aUsing’s In-
diana teams won 47 games, lost 10
and in 1968 he took an undefeated
team to the Boardwalk Bowl.

Klausing’s next stop was Morgan-
town and West Virginia.'He was an
assistant to Bobby Bowden. Success
being his trade mark, the Moun-
taineers were 46 and 26 while Klaus-
ing was there.

move to Carnegie Mellon Universi-
ty. While at WVU, Bowden realized
Klausing/s potential as a head coach
and told him that he would be next
in line for the head coaching job
there. Klausing waited; but nothing
happened. He was then offered a job
with the Pittsburgh Steelers as a
scout.

Hearing news of this, Bowden and
the West Virginia athletic director
assured him of the top spot; it still
didn't come. Klausing then saw the
chance to go to CMU and did.

He came to Pittsburgh and took the
reigns of the CMU Spartans. While
at CMU, his teams won six Presi-
dent's Athletic Conference cham-
pionships and a Lambert Trophy,
signifying eastern football supremacy,
and he distinguished himself by be-
ing named Coach of the Year in the
PAC six times, as" well as WTBS Divi-
sion III ‘Coach of the Year in 1983.
Klausing was also named Small Col-
lege Coach of the Year in 1979 by
ABC sports.

At the endyof the 1985 season
Klausing considered retiring from
coaching. As we all know, that didn't
happen. Mike Gottfried took the head
coaching job at Pitt, and in naming
his staff he included Chuck Klausing.

legiate game against Purdue. Gott-
fried was very impressed with his
young freshman from Valdosta,
Ga. “Hosea didn't play like a
freshman,” said Gottfried. ”He
caught ‘a couple of passes and he
didn't bust any routes. He's a long
ball threat and he will start Saturday.”

Meanwhile, Gottfried is confident
in Gillaspie and feels he just needs
more playing time. ”Darrin is com-
ing along well," said Gottfried. ”He
hasn't played as much as I want him
to, but he'll getvsome more time.”
. The question concerning Pitt is,
who will start at the other receiver
position. Gottfried isn't sure and he
said that question will be answered
this week at practice.

To provide depth, Gottfried has
moved senior Keith Tinsley to wide
receiver. Tinsley is a three-year letter-
winner at defensive back.

If Pitt doesn't want to move away
from its pass-happy offense, it will
have to start using other options, such
as the tight ends. But just like another
football team in this city, the Panthers
don’t throw to the tight end too often.

Sophomore tight end Vernon Kirk
has caught only three passes this
year, but Gottfried hopes that will

soon change.'”We have to get the

tight ends more involved in the of-
fense,” said Gottfried. ”We’|'| cut
down on some of our offensive for-
mations and try some different things
so we can use our tight ends more.”

Once again though, the problem at
tight end is a lack of talent and depth.
Kirk is a converted running back, and
backups, sophomore Tom Huebner
and freshman Mark Altsman, haven't
seen much playing time this season.

On the flip side of the coin, Pitt's
passing offense will be aided by the
fact that Gottfried has made a habit
of throwing to his running backs as
much as possible. That could be part
of the reason why Gottfried has ap-
parently benched junior tailback
Charles Gladman in favor of
sophomore Craig ”Ironhead”
Heyward. Despite a nice touchdown
catch against Purdue last Saturday,
Gladman has dropped a number of
passes this season.

' However, Gottfried said at yester-
day's press conference that he will
not decide whether Heyward or
Gladman will start against West
Virginia until after tomorrow's
practice. '

Pitt's running backs have com-
bined for 25 catches for 218 yards in
the first three games. Last season the
Panther backs caught only 33 passes
over the entire year. -

The numerous injuries Pitt has en-
dured are a big concern of Gottfried’s
and not only at the receiver position,
but everywhere. He realizes things
must get better before they. get worse.
”We are as thin as we could be,”
commented Gottfried. ”So we'll be
in deep trouble if we get any more
injuries.”

PANTHER NOTES: Gottfried said
yesterday that junior quarterback Sal
Genilla will probably be red-shirted
this season. ”Congemi got hurt
against Purdue and he almost had to
come out,” said Gottfried. ’’If he did,

i l would have used freshman Larry

Wanke.” The 6-6, 270-pound offen-
sive tackle Jim Zdelar was dismissed
from the squad on Monday for miss-
ing a team meeting.

are steady but inexperienced, with
Matt Smith being the only starting
senior. The secondary is agressive
and certainly not battle-shy. All-
America candidate Travis Curtis is a
three-year starter known for his
vicious shots on ball carriers. This is
one area of the Mountaineers that is
exceptionally deep.

Despite each team's recent slip
from the upper echelon of college
football, the Pitt-WVU rivalry is as in-
tense as ever. When the emotions
take control this Saturday, the Moun-
taineers could very well have Pitt's
Panthers yelling the retreat cry of
”Run for the Hills!”

Mountaineers set
for annual battlep

By Joe Zeff

Associate Editor

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. —— Don
Nehlen, the West Virginia football
coach, had apparently mistaken the
leader of the Pitt Panthers defense for
someone found nowhere on the
roster.

”They’re a real fine football team,”
Nehlen said, ’’yet I believe their
strength may be with their defense,
anchored by Stan Woods.”

Nehlen distinguished Stan Woods
among the finest defensive players in
America, even though most Pitt fans
have never heard of any football
player named Stanley‘-Woods. Yet
Nehlen correctly identified Stan
Woods as one of his biggest concerns
when West Virginia visits Pitt
Stadium Saturday afternoon.

Stanley Anthony Woods, that is.

Apparently, Nehlen has researched
his upcoming opponent so thorough-
ly as to uncover the dormant’ first
name of its left defensive end. He still
hasn’t_managed to figure out the Pan-
ther offense, however.

”When you talk about Pitton of-
fense, they do everything,” Nehlen
said. ’’I mean, they throw the foot-
ball.‘ There is not one single forma-
tion that’s ever been invented that
they don't use.

”They run trips-right, trips-left,
doub|e—s|ots, one-back-in-the-back-
field, both-backs-in-the-backfield.
They'll screen. They'll bootleg. They
do everything known to man, so I
think it puts a lot more pressure on
our defense because their offense is

so much more diversified than it has
been in the past.” A

West Virginia, after victories
against Northern Illinois and East
Carolina, fell to 2-1 last Saturday with
a 24-3 loss against Maryland. lts of-
fense suffers without place-kicker
Charlie Baumann, who remains ques-
tionable for the Pitt game with a
strained thigh muscle.

”l’l| say this, l’m not about to kick
Charlie Baumann to try to beat Pitt
and then not have him for the rest of
the season. Pitt is one game on the
schedule, and we have a lot of games
remaining,” Nehlen said.

The offense is otherwise stable.
Tailback Undra Johnson leads West
Virginia with 234 rushing yards, an
average of 5.3 yards per carry.
Quarterback Mike Timko has com-
pleted 46 of 91 passes for 547 yards
and three touchdowns and has been
intercepted only twice in three
games.

Nehlen has been dissatisfied with
his offense, he said. .

”We were not very good, against
Maryland. I told our coaches it would
behoove us a great deal if we learned
how to score a touchdown. We'd
have a little better opportunity to win
if we'd learn to do that, so they're
working real hard on that part of the
game.” ‘ —

West Virginia amassed 308 offen-
sive yards against Maryland but failed

to score a touchdown and allowed A h

370 yards defensively. Nehlen said
that he does not underestimate the
Panthers, despite their 1-1-1 record.
”We think Pitt is a very, very good

 Women's tennis team
eekend series

splits w

By Beth Froelich

Sta ff Writer

The Pitt women's tennis team took
to the road this past weekend in mat-
ches at St. Francis and Bucknell.

Pitt downed St. Francis in an im-
pressive 8-1 victory. In singles play
the Lady Panthers won five of the six
matches played. The following are
the women's singles scores:

Levine 6-1, 7-6, 7-5
Feltingoff 3-6, 6-7, 2-7
Nelson 6-7, 7-5, 6-4, 6-1
DeVera 6-1, 6-0
Kartzman 6-0, 6-1
Meade 6-2, 6-0

Assistant tennis coach Emma
Creighton commented/’The girls
team played very well. Talent and
hard work combined to effect a vic-

tory of that magnitude.”

The Lady Panthers shut out the St.
Francis squad in doubles play 3-0.
Levine and Feltingoff won over their
opponents 6-1, 7-6 and 7-5. DeVera
combined skills with Casner to defeat
the St. Francis team 8-2. Kartzman
and Meade rounded out doubles
play, winning easily, 8-1.

The Lady Panthers met a different

fate though the following day in a
match against talented Bucknell. The
Pitt team lost to Bucknell 2-7.

Carrie DeVera played impressive-
ly in the match, capturing Pitt's only
singles and doubles wins. The rest of
the team played tough, competitive
tennis, going three sets in some in-
stances with their worthy opponents.
The women's tennis team fared in
singles play as follows:

Levine 2-6, 6-7, 6-8
Feltingoff 2-6, 1-6
Nelson 2-6, 7-6, -7, 3-6

DeVera 6-3, 6-2

Kartzman 0-6, 6-4, 4-6
Meade 4-6, 0-6

Levine commented after the
match/Bucknell was a tough, con-
sistent team, and they simply over-
powered us in close sets.”

In doubles action, the Pitt women
lost two of the three close matches
played. Levine and Feltingoff gave
the Bucknell team a run for their
money, finishing 6-8. DeVera and

Nelson captured the sole doubles,

win for Pitt with a score of 8-4. Kartz-
man and Meade kept the score a
close 6-8 in their match.

Nelson added after the match,”|
think we were pretty evenly matched
with Bucknell. The match could have
[gone] either way. We played well
against an excellent team, which in
turn will build our confidence as a
team.”

The women's tennis team will take
to the courts again today at 3 p.m. in
a home match against Robert Morris.

The injury to ‘Reggie Williams (above) has thinned out Pitt's already shallow
receiving corps. Defensive back Keith Tinsley has been moved to wide receiver
for this week's West Virginia game.

MORCANTOWN, W. Va. — This

is not Almost Heaven. This is Heaven.

If the state of West Virginia ever
builds a turnpike, only St. Peter could
work the tollbooth. A

Coach Don Nehlen could not ask
for better working conditions. He has
indoctrinated the entire state from his
unlikely pulpit, turning West Virginia
football into a religious experience.
Even the state governor-recognizes
this, welcoming more than 60,000
parishioners to Mountaineer Field in
the program peddled at home games.
And whenever West Virginia hits the
road, the congregation obediently
follows.

Pitt ticket manager Richard
Lukehart said he expects between
10,000 and 12,000 West‘Virginia
fans to attend the game tomorrow;
Joe Boczek, West Virginia spokes-
man, said the university sold out its
contracted allotment of 5,300 tickets
at least a month ago. The remainder
of the tickets originated from Pitt.

’’It doesn't matter whether it's East
Carolina or the Gator Bowl or Pitt or
Penn State. Wherever we go, we're
going to take a lot of people because
they have a lot of pride in our team,”
Nehlen said.

”The reason for that, and I'm not
being critical of anyone else, is we're

the only show in town. On Saturday
afternoon if you live in West Virginia,
where in the hell else are you going
to go except for Morgantown?”

' Morgantown_and Pittsburgh are ap-
proximately 75 miles apart, which
makes the backyard brawl between
West Virginia and Pitt one ofthe most
interesting rivalries for both teams.
They have played against each other
78 times beginning in 1895, and Pitt
maintains a 52-24-2 advantage. The
Panthers have not won since 1982.
Before 62,453 spectators last season
at Mountaineer Field, they played to
a 10-10 tie.

A. B. Brown made his first col-
legiate start at tailback for Pitt, rushing
16 times for 105 yards. Brown and
tailback Eugene Napoleon both
transferred from Pitt to_West Virginia
after last season and must sit out this
year before regaining eligibility. Both
players were made unavailable for in-
terviews by West Virginia.

Also stoking the rivalry are four

.West Virginia starters who attended

Pittsburgh high schools. Brian Smider
of Allderdice and Milton Redwine of
Brashear, are offensive tackles,
Harvey Smith of Gateway plays split

end and Darnell Warren of
McKeesport will start at inside
linebacker.

”|t’s strange going home,” Smider
said, ”especially when you're going
to be the opponents, the visiting
team. Everybody is going to be
rooting against you in your
hometown. It will be weird.”

It will be_even more unusual
because Smider considered himself

’a Pitt fan before enrolling at West

Virginia. He said he notices a marked
difference between fans of Pitt and
West Virginia.

’’I had never heard of the Pitt-West

Virginia rivalry as a rivalry until I
came down here,”
sophomore. ”The people here take
it very seriously. it's a big partof foot-
ball down here. It's all around, the
players and the fans.”

Redwine agrees. He is looking for-
ward to playing at Pitt Stadium

because his friends and family will be  ‘I ' I

there. He originally accepted a
scholarship at Miami, Fla., but he

suddenly decided to transfer. He»

settled on West Virginia rather than
Pitt.

come from the same area; it's just that
we picked different schools. Now we
want to prove to each other who
picked the better school and who has
become the better player.
”Knowing that I'm home, I want to

do much better. I want to go up there .
and feel that I'm at home and show -

the people why I've come to West
Virginia, whatl think this program is
about.” : . I

What this program is about is more
than 10,000 West Virginia fans‘ ex-
pected to fill one end zoneof Pitt
Stadium. What this program is about
is relentless allegiance to a college
football team, regardless of its win-
loss record.

What this program is about is sim-
ply Heaven.

Heard about

at wide

By Bob ‘Travers
Sports Editor

Pitt Coach Mike Gottfried has
opened up the offense as promised,
scoring~41 points last week against
Purdue, but injuries to key players
have necessitated changes for the
game tomorrow against West
Virginia.

Keith Tinsley has been switched
from left cornerback to receiver,
where Pitt has little depth. Reggie
Williams was the Panthersf leading
receiver before breaking his fibula
last week and will be sidelined for
four to six weeks. Replacing Williams
is freshman‘ Hosea Heard, who
caught three passes for 35 yards
against Purdue. _

”Hosea did not play like a

. freshman,” Gottfried said. ”Heard

will definitely start. He's a real long-
ball threat for us."’

Billy Osborn, a sophomore with
four catches for 46 yards this season,
will start at flanker.

Questions persist in the backfield.
Rumors that Charles Gladman will
not start against West Virginia have
surrounded Pitt all week. Gladman
was Pitt’s leading rusher last year, and
he presently leads Panther rushers
with 209 yards. The starting tailback
will probably not be known until
Pitt's first offensive play of the game.

The Pitt backfield will consist of
quarterback John Congemi, fullback
Tom Brown and either Gladman or
Craig "|ronhead” Heyward playing
tailback. Reserves Matt LaV_igna and
Nate Heyward should also see play-
ing time.

The success of the Pitt running

‘game could determine whether Pitt
Will control the game as they did last
week. The West Virginia defensive
line IS as big as the mouth of the
Shenandoah River. Anchoring the
Mountaineer defense are left tackle
Brad Hunt (6-2, 282), nose tackle
David Grant (6-4, 282) and Jeff Lucas
(6-6, 27 3).

Gottfried said the West Virginia
defense, a 5-2 set-up, is pretty much

what the Panthers have seen thus far '

PANTHERS
HAVE THE BALI.

this year. He said he does not expect

to radically alter his offensive game _

plan against the Mountaineers.

The Pitt offense revolves around
quarterback John Congemi, the fifth-
year senior who has been playing as
well as ever. Congemi is 64 of 112
this season and has thrown two
touchdown passes. Should Congemi
be injured tomorrow, expect his
replacement to be freshman Larry
Wanke rather than junior college
transfer Sal Genilla, whomGottfried
hopes to redshirt.

Teams have had more success run-
ning against the Mountaineers rather
than throwing. Opponents have
averaged 209.7 yards rushing per
game, but-only 149.7 yards passing.
This may be partially attributable to
Matt Smith, the West Virginia
linebacker who is an All-America
candidate.

The Pitt offense will have to play
as well as they did last week to beat
West Virginia. Gottfried has been
fine-tuning his offense all season, but
injuries have prevented him from
placing the 11 best offensive playe
on the field at one time. '

The injury to Williams means this

week will be the same. Heard, .

Michael Stewart and Darrin G illaspie
have shown promise, but they are ex-
tremely inexperienced. Congemi is
certainly experienced and will have
to cover for inexperienced players at
other skill positions. Pitt will also
need a big day from their running
backs to keep West Virginia off-
balance.

The West Virginia offense last
week was plagued by the same thing
that cost Pitt wins its first two games
of the season. The Mountaineers
looked unstoppable between the 30-
yard lines against Maryland, but near
the goal line they were helpless. That
would not have been nearly so bad
had West Virginia placekickers not
missed four field goals.
