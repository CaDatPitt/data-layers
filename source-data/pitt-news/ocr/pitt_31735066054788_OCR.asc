Twenty Pitt service
employees ﬂooded the stadium
with leaﬂets crying for people
to help them out before

. Thursday’s game.

The leaﬂets, distributed at
gates nine, 11, and the main
gate before the Pitt—Boston
College game, urged members
of the crowd to call Jerry
Cochran, the vice chancellor
for business and ﬁnance, "and

 

express their concern for union
employees working without a
contract. 9

Members of Pitt’s Service
Employees International Union
Local 29, who have been work-
ing for 10 months without a
contract, have pressed the
administration to set a new date
for negotiations, and have ﬁnal-
ly had enough, according to
George Dietriech, the union’s
president.

“The last excuse we heard
was that Jerry Cochran was on

the committee to select an ath-
letic director, and that’s done,”
said Dietriech.

Cochran could not be
reached for comment.

Though few participants
wanted to talk, saying they
were afraid of recent layoffs,
some pointed to the leaﬂet itself
to answer questions. It read,
“It’.s Halloween, and we’re
scared.”

The workers’ contract
ended on Dec. 31, 1995, and
since that time, they have been

The governor was met with applause
and cheers yesterday at a rally in Mt.
Lebanon as he addressed his concerns about
people taking a passive role in the voting
process.

Amidst the patriotically-colored politi-

. calposters, Ridge expressed his hope for an

ample voter turnout because, he said,
“Billions of people on the planet  don’t get
to choose their leaders as leaders.”

Ridge also voiced concern that people
vote for the candidate they can trust.

“For anyone to think the White House
is not subject to the same scrutiny as ordi-
nary citizens is wrong,” he said. “There has
been controversy swirling around the cur-

 

rent administration since day one.  They
have exercised bad judgement. They say
they’re going to reform welfare and then
veto it twice, they replace ‘J ustsay no’ with
‘Just don’t inhale.’ That’s bad judgement.”

. During the gathering, the governor crit-
icized the “arrogance” of the Clinton
administration, which he described as

. choosing not to immediately comply with

Federal Election Commission laws and
release its campaign ﬁinding sources.

' Ridge also introduced Republican can-
didates for Pennsylvania offices to the
assemblage, who also addressed the ‘crowd
with their platforms.

In an interview with The Pitt News,
Tom Ridge expressed the need for colle-
gians to vote, regardless of who they vote

of the old contract. On Oct. 9,
according to Dietriech, they
asked for new meeting dates. Al
Boggs of the human resources
department didn’t have the
dates yet. On Oct. 25, Dietriech
said, there were still no dates.

“The mediator told us that
we’ve done our part, but Pitt

Dietriech. “It’s time to move

Dietriech, will save Pitt $100
per month per employee. That
sum, Dietriech argues, would
pay for the salary increase.

Under the current family
coverage program, Pitt pays
$410 per person each month,
and would only pay $312 if it
made the switch, said
Dietriech. »

According to Defense Secretary

The American pilots claim that they
had been targeted by radar in south-

fired the missiles. However, Perry
said that there is no evidence that the

course of our country over the next 40
years,” said Stephanopoulos.

Stephanopoulos predicted at least three
new justices will be appointed to the U.S.
Supreme Court. Their political ideology
will have a great inﬂuence on the course of
American society.

“Affirmative action was almost
destroyed,” he said discussing the recent
actions of the court. “And now they are get-
ting ready to handle the issue of a woman’s
right to choose.”

As Stephanopoulos opened himself to

questions, the topic of the conference
immediately turned to education.
Restating the Democratic agenda,
Stephanopoulos spoke of plans to establish
the Hope Scholarship, which provides a
$1500 tax credit to families so they can

aﬁord the first two years of community col- "

lege and a $10,000 tax deduction for stu-
dents in four—year colleges, as a priority no
matter what happens Tuesday.

‘This would make the 13th and 14th
grades as universal as high school is now,”
said Stephanopoulos.

‘ Carville arrived on the phone near the
end of the conference, listeningto the con-
versation for a while and then joining in to
address The Pitt News ‘ question of whether
the issues being debated in this election

 FROM PAGE I

such as Medicare, the budget, and social
security have alienated student voters.

“I think student voters have a good
understanding of next years’ budget issues
and social security, although it’s not as key
to them,” said Carville.

Still speaking to The Pitt News on the.

matter of what would affect the Democratic
ticket, Carville said votes for Perot would-
n’t signiﬁcantly help or hurt either the GOP
or Democratic party tickets. «

‘There are as many nutty people who
would vote for us as Dole,” Carville joked
before ending his lengthy response with an
enthusiastic. “Let’srgo Panthers!”

Carville and Stephanopoulos talked
about how different running the campaign

' is since their battle four years ago in Little

Rock’s “War Room.”

“[Clinton] is not doing as many MTV
“town meetings” and those sorts of things
because he has to be president,” said
Stephanopoulos. “But he’s not neglecting
the youth vote at all.”

Both aides said they will continue to
pursue that vote up to election day.

“I detect a lot of student enthusiasm in
1996,” said Carville at the end of the con-
ference. _

“Voting is not a privilege; it is a respon-
sibility,” the govemor said. “We don’t have
to stand in front of tanks to vote. We can
affect change on a yearly basis. I encourage
young people to live up to their civic duty.”

Ridge explained how important it is for
the younger generation to take a stand polit-
ically. “You are affected by what is going on
today tomorrow,” he said.

He also noted the importance of recog-
nizing this power. According to the gover-
nor, the govemment is  but the indi-
vidual voter is unlimited. Young voters, he
stressed, should realize this and vote for the
party which will effect the most beneﬁcial
change for them. ’

This, according to Ridge, is the founda-
tion of the Republican party. “People work
hard for their money,” he said. “College is
expensive. The fruit of your labor belongs to
you, not the government. Vote for the party
that promises that.” '

Ridge stressed that people need to real-
ize that government and bureaucracy do not
go hand in hand. He said voters need to send
that message to Washington.

‘.‘[Republicans] understand that govern-
ment has nomoney — it’s yours,” he said.
“We need to give you some of your money
back.” Ridge said he feels Republican
candidates would be better able to provide
for college students’ needs. _

“When you have to work January to
rnid-May just to pay taxes alone, there is
something wrong with the system,” he said.

Ridge also expressed conﬁdence that
the Republican party is able to assure a

 

more beneﬁcial society for the young gen-
eration.
“For the first time in six years,

Pennsylvania unemployment is below the-

national leve ,” Ridge said. “The death
penalty protocol give victims their rights.

Welfare reform forces recipients to get into

the work force to receive aid.”

The campaign tour, a last—minute effort
by Pennsylvania Republicans’ to rally vot-
ers, began in Johnstown. The Mt. Lebanon
rally_was the second stop.

Bob Nyce, a candidate for auditor gen-
eral, said college students should also look
at whom‘ they vote into state ofﬁces. “You

have to think about who’s going to audit the

books [of the university]. You want value
for your money.”

Dave Fawcett, congressional candidate
for the South Hills and much of the Mon-
Valley, focused on voters learning about the

platforms of the candidates. “Most people

don’t know their congressman, "and, if they
do, they don’t know what he stands for,” he
said. '

consider character as well as platform and to
make an informed and heartfelt choice.
“They should "vote for the candidate who
stands for what they believe in,” he said.

Ridge also said he feels the Clinton
administration reveals itself as unreliable
and untrustworthy. “[George
Stephanopoulos] said ‘We only kept the
promises we meant to keep.’ When I look at
the past four years and their original plat-
form, I don’t think they ‘meant’ to keep
them.” ' .

(Marxists share the same views, but take a decid-
‘edly diiferent approach to present issues than the

two ﬁont—rLmning candidates.

The basic‘ dogma for any socialist candidate

is to mobilize the working class in a mass revolt

- against big business—inﬂuenced ' government. The

goal of such a revolt is the development of a new
system of government, by the American worker
for the American worker, according to the
International Socialist Organization at Pitt.

According to the organization, the ideal sys-
tem would guarantee every citizen a job, a house,
and a decent life through necessary cooperation
and the elimination of the dog-eat—dog state of
mind that has been perpetuated by the capitalist
economy. pi ‘ ~

According to a brochure from the Socialist
Equality Party, govenrrnent should eliminate the
current distribution of wealth, in which 1 percent
of the U.S. population controls 40 percent of. the
wealth in this country. -‘ - .

“I support a ‘trickle-up’ theory. We have

-given our‘ money to the rich long enough to

observe decisively that it does not lead to a safe,
secure, happy society,” Hollis said.

I “This Amendment is a right—wing nostrum

big corporations, and interest payments, to the

ed. ~ A
The abortion issue is clear—cut for bottr of
these candidates. According ’ to their literature,
Hollis and White are pro-choice.
White and Hollis are divided on the issue of
American workers. » . - _
Hollis supports the idea of afﬁrmative action
as a possible way to bring about a more uniﬁed
work force, but sees the possibility for itvto cause

’ disturbance as well.

White is against affirmative action, but insists
a diiferent agenda must be set. .
“We must guarantee jobs and educational

opportunities for all — not limited quotas,” White

‘said, . . _

taxes, estate taxes and income taxes for those who

make over $100,000 a year are going to face large

increases. Taxes for. those in the lower tax brack-
ets are going to be gently maintained if not slight-
ly decreased. Both partiesplan support the basic
tenet that in these troubled economic times, those

that have should give to those who don’t. As a ,
-. result, they say, all Americans could reach a bal-
anced point of existence ina productive, classless '

society. _, .
Whether it be tax incentives for companies to
hire homeless people or tax breaks for low-
income families, tax reform is on the agenda as
one of the top priorities in getting the country back
on track, according to the candidates.

The--two candidates said they represent the
ideas of a much larger political agenda dedicated
to promoting the socialist way of life.

Big business was battered by

Bolshevism last night, as the
International Socialist Organization
challenged Clinton and Dole support-
erstoadebateintheWilliamPit1
Union’s Dining Room.

The Socialists had been trying to
coordinate the event with ‘both the
University Democrats and College
Republicans for overamonttr. .

,“The Republicans never returned

I our calls. We would try them day in

and day out, until ﬁnally we managed
to contact one of them,” said Deepa
Kurnar, Pitt International Socialist
Organization president. “The
Democrats said they wouldn’t do it.”

. Many members of the Socialist
Organization, such as Tina Gross, were
annoyed by the apathy displayed by the
two political groups. 9

“We don’t know if they are too
busy or if they are just blowing us 0 , ,”

‘ Gross said. “We assume that it’s the lat-

ter.

« Kurnar attacked the laissez-faire
attitude of the Democrats and
Republicans. . - .

‘ are they so scared of‘? If
they’re conﬁdent-enough to run a can-
didate, then why aren’t they conﬁdent
enough to come and speak about what
they believe in?” Kurnar said.

As the debate ﬁnally began, the
Republicans ﬁelded alast-minute rep-
resentative who came on his own after
being let out of class early, rather than

_as an appointee. No Democrats

showed.

‘The, evening’s debate focused on ‘

the Socialist political stance, occasion-
ally lashing out at a cornprornised con-

 

  

Major parties are no-
    shows of socialist debate

J servative view and an unrepresented
« democratic platform. , '

“Change cannot come from
above,” said Kurnar. “We have a

- unique historical opportunity to form a

grass-roots" campaign of socialism that

, uses strikes, demonstrations, and strug-

gles that come ﬁom the bottom.”

. Kurnar referred to worker strikes
that recently shut down the city of
Toronto for two days and a strike
which crippled parts of France last

. December for several weeks.

“Our. task is to unite these strug-

gles and raise the important issues,” she »

said

are working to reform the issues that
Washington has glazed over, such. as
Medicare,  minimum wages, and
“decent” jobs. .

The lone College Republican rep-
resentative, Brendan Deshaney, tumed
to a more middle—of-the-roadapproach
of the GOP platform, Struggling to
reach out to the audience, which had
identiﬁed itself as mainly liberal.

‘v‘C1inton‘ﬂip-ﬂops too muc ,”
Deshaney said to the audience. “At
least if you’re a communist, you’re a
communist, or if you’re a socialist,
you’re a socialist, and you stand by it.”

Deshaney rallied support among
many in attendance by speaking
against upper-class control of the gov-
ernment, corporate welfare, and the

.“Income tax  screws the

. middle class,’Z Deshaney said. “I’m not

manied to the Republican party.”

.By the conclusion of the debate,
many problems had been discussed,
but the Socialist solution, Cal Hollis,
the ‘Socialist Party’s write-in presiden-

tial candidate, was not mentioned at all.

It should not be surpris-

people in all sorts of organi-

Students question electoral college

Christene Muller

   

Many students feel the electoral college
is outdated and their vote is being over-
looked, according to man-on-the-street inter-
views conducted by The Pitt News.

“I think because of the electoral college
it makes people voting a very moot point and
a minority vote loses their power,” said
Nicholas Bozovich, a freshman who consid-
ers himself an independent.

The electoral college was originally sup-
posed to function without political parties and
national campaigns.

The electoral college is over 200 years
old. It is used to ensure that the president has
enough popular support to govern and that
support is distributed evenly throughout the
country, which should enable the president to
govern effectively.

Whenasked about the electoral college
and voting, students either had a basic kr1owl—
edge of the college, didn’t quite understand it,
or didn’t even care.

“I’m more for direct democracy,” said
Bozovich. ‘That way everyone has a vote.”

A lot of students feel the same way.
Becky Clark, a junior, is .a registered
Democrat Clark said she didn’t like the elec-
toral college because it “lets the electorate
choose the president instead of the people.”

Jessica Koontz, a junior, said she wasn’t .

very familiar with the electoral college.

“I’m beginning to realize [voting] is a lot
more important than I had previously
[thought],” said Koontz, who is avregistered
Independent. '

Article 1, Section 2, and various amend-
ments of the U.S. Constitution aid Americans
in picking the president.

The electoral college is a collective

name for the electors who nominally choose A

the president and the vice-president. It‘ is
made up of 538 members: _

It has always been up to each state legis-
lator to choose how to pick its electors. Each
state has two Senators, and they make up 100
of the total 538 electors. The remaining elec-
tors correspond directly to the amount of
Congressional representatives each state has.

The amount of representatives ranges
from state to state. The smallest are Montana,
Wyoming, and Rhode Island, each with three
electors. The largest are California (54),
Texas (32), and Pennsylvania (23). With the
corresponding electors forall 50 states’ repre-
sentatives included, electors total 435. The
District of Columbia has three electoral rep-
resentatives, though it lacks Congressional
representation. -

When the electoral college was ﬁrst
drafted, the vote for president and vice—presi-
dentwere separate. Theindividuals with the
highest -and second-highest vote totals

became president and vice-president, respec-

tively.

The winning vote had to be a simple
majority plus one. In event of a tie, the House
of Representatives chose the president

In the election. of 1800, Thomas
Jefferson and Aaron Burr, both running for
the Democratic-Republican Party, had an
equal number of electoral votes. The tie was
settled in Jelferson’s favor, but only after 36
attempts and some serious political problems.
This was what the electoral college was sup-
posed to prevent.

In elections before 1900, three presidents
won the candidacy by virtue of the electoral
college. John Quincy Adams won in 1824,
Rutherford B. Hayes won in 1876, and
Benjamin Harrison won in l888,- even
though their opponents won the popular vote.
No president has won an electoral college
victory in contradiction to the popular vote in
the 20th century. I «

By making changes (which seemed
small at the time) to the 12th Amendment, ﬂue
states altered the electoral college and

allowed for political parties to be an integral
part of the presidential elections.

When a voter went to the polls in over
half the states, they would only see the presi-
dential and vice—presidential candidates
appear on the ballot. These voters picked
electors rather than voting directly for the
candidates. In other states, voters picked both
the candidates and the electors. ,

The method for choosing electors was

standardized by 1836. Adirect statewide pop— '

ular vote was enlisted in all states except
Maine and Nebraska, which changed in 1969
and 1991, respectively to a statewide popular
vote.

The winning set of electors meet on the
Monday following the second Wednesday in
Dec. Two ballots are taken. Each elector casts
one vote for each candidate. An elector
almost always votes for the candidate he
pledges to before casting his vote, but he is
not legally bound to do so.

The results are sent on Jan. 6 to be count- 9

ed in front of the newly—elected House of
Representatives and the Senate.

This is why, when campaigning, candi-
dates try to win over the states with the most
electoral votes. They target Califomia, Texas,
Florida, New York, and Illinois.

Even though the uses of the electoral
college have changed over time, voters are
still casting their votes for the electors for the
presidential and vice—presidential candidates
of their choice. —- not for the candidates
themselves. ..

The candidates for the elector are rarely

listed on the ballot They will appear as
“Electors for” in ﬁne print on the ballot in

front of each set of candidates.

If not otherwise speciﬁed, state laws
specify ﬂiat votes cast for candidates are to be
counted for the list of delegates pledged to the
candidates. The list of electors who pledged
themselves to the candidates has to be equal
to the number of a state’s electoral vote.

The upcoming election will create an
impact on local, state, and national levels,
but some people stepping into the polls

may not realize what effect their vote,

may have internationally.

When John L. Washbum, former
director in the department of political
affairs at the United Nations, came to Pitt
two weeks ago, he emphasized the polit-
ical effect of the elections ‘on an intema—
tional level.

Before students and faculty in the
Pitt Law School’s Teplitz Memorial
Courtroom, Washbum said the tinting for
his discussion could not have beenmore

appropriate.

“The context for this [lecture] is the
upcoming American presidential elec-
tion,” said Washbum. He said the moves
the U.S. makes within the global com-
munity will be directly inﬂuenced by
which party claims the presidential seat.

Washbum focused his lecture on
sovereignty as a criticism of the
Republican. Party’s standpoint on the
matter. The Republicans currently refuse
to sacriﬁce any of America’s 'self—gover-
nance in order to participate more effec-
tively in the United Nations, said
Washbum.

“The Republicans are talking about.

sovereignty  what does it mean" to have
sovereignty but still participate in an

organization like the United Nations?”
Washbum said. .

He said he supported the U.S. sacri-
ﬁcing enough of its global independence
to gain a greater governing voice within
the U.N. body.

“People in the Republican Party

think that there is little that matters to be ,

obtained by taking the position of sacri-
ficing a degree [of sovereignty],”
Washbum said,
He said this philosophy will be dam-
aging to the United States in the future.
“The essential usefulness of the U.N.

' to the U.S. will end or be severely darn-

aged,” said Washbum, if the U.S. contin-
ues with this lack of foresight for its glob-
al future. ‘

According to him, we live in a time
of national and global problems that
countries can no longer handle by them-
selves. “Nations are being forced to give
up a great deal of their sovereignty and
domestic ruling power,” he said.

The trend for other countries to step
in and handle another nation’s problems
has steadily increased in the past decade,
said Washbum. He" said nations are being
made to’ give up their independence.

“We have seen signiﬁcant incursions
on the sovereignty of counties  such as
the humanitarian intervention in the Iraq
situation,” he said. Eventually, this may
extend to the U.S. whether it likes it or
not, said Washbum. So why, Washbum

argued, should America be so staunchly

against_ giving up a little freedom?
Further, he argued, opposition to reduced
sovereignty looks bad diplomatically.

Reluctance on the part of the United

States to give up any sovereignty in its
foreign policy has already begun to
prove hannful, according to Washbum.
He stated that the U.S. has to sacriﬁce
some of its autonomy now in order to
remain a power in the global community.

“The United States’ capacity to lead
in the United Nations has been increas-
ingly declining,” said Washburn. “There
is a lesson to be learned here.”

Washburn’s address was also aimed
at establishing what sovereignty in the
eyes of other nations means to a state as
a tool of diplomacy. He discussed how
the concept affects the actions of nations
other than the U,.S., that participate in the
United Nations.

“Larger countries will always have
more sovereignty than small ones,”
Washbum said. “But the U.N. exists to
close the gap between weak and power-
ful nations.”

Washbum also addressed his concern

that nations need to work together more
efficiently through the U.-N., which he
said is “only running at about 75 percent
right now.”
9 He said that he felt the United
Nations Assembly is making great
progress in an age in which advanced
communication via the intemet, tensions
caused by nuclear weaponry in unstable
nations, and the division of long estab-
lished countries are all playing a unique
part in how counnies interact.

Prior to his position in the depart-
ment of political affairs from which he
resigned in 1994, John Washbum was a
director in the executive office of the sec-
retary general of the United Nations. He
has also held such distinguished seats as
consulate general in India and U.S.
petroleum affairs ofﬁcer in Iran.

Washbmn is currently on the Board
of Directors of the United Nations
Association of New York and frequently
gives lectures on the United Nations.

“You realize that if you don’t stand up

in everyone’s best interest, so ‘why

another Greek. “We are driving to vote

According to Kerry Daley,‘ the
Greek adviser, this attitude is reﬂected
in the everyday lives of the Greeks she

who like to be involved,” she said.
“Theyare issue-oriented.”

  An open letter

to Craig Patrick

4/! .gz'a.;_.3s- 4' 3.  "-.’-: "

    

Dear Mr. Craig Patrick, ,
' Everyone is ecstatic that the

Pittsburgh Penguins’ offense broke
through in a big way with a 7-3 win
over a rising Ottawa Senators

' squad Saturday night. The line of

Jaromir Jagr, Petr Nedved and Ron
Francis exploded forsix goals,
something the all—star squad has
been missing thus far this season.
We know this team is stacked
with scoring talent. And we’re
aware that the Pens have a solid

7' _ goalie in Ken Wregget. Even net-

minder Tom Barrasso is capable of
getting the job done. ’

Unfortunately, Mr. Patrick, you’re V

forgetting the one key ingredient.

Defense.

You know, those guys who
stand tall and play tough hockey at
the blueline? Those men who keep
the opposition from getting close
to the goal? Surely, you must think
the Pens are good enough to get by
without defense.

Now that you’ve seen what
happens when Jagr, Lemieux, and
company can’t put the puck in the
net and your best —— make that only

—— defensemen are Kevin Hatcher

and Chris Tamer.

We understand that you’re
waiting for the perfect deal to ship
Brian Smolinski out of town for a
rugged blueliner. If you wait any
longer, the Penguins could dig
themselves into a hole, making it
very difficult to climb out.

' Trade Smoliski. Trade
Sandstrom. Jesus, trade somebody
and pick up some defense. If Craig
Muni is your idea of a guy who can
clean up this squad’s messes, it’s
time to step back and take a look at
.this team from a fan’s perspective.

Give Wregget and Barrasso a
break back there. More important-

Runners’ high
grounded at
Big East meet

Geoff Moak

There were few surprises at last
Friday’s Big East cross—country champi-
onship meet in Boston’s Franklin Park.
The perennial powerhouses clustered at
the top, and Pitt was ﬁghting in the rnid—
dle of the pack. Pitt’s women ﬁnished
eighth, with the men 10th.

Neither the men nor the women of
Pitt had thoughts of challenging the top
Big East teams in the meet, but thought
they could be the best of the rest. The
women nearly were.

Providence won the women’s meet
with 47 points, led by ﬁrst-place ﬁnish-
er Marie McMahon, who had a time of
16:36. Georgetown, Villanova, Boston
College, and Notre Dame were second
through fifth, as expected. Pitt battled
West Virginia and Connecticut for sixth
place, also as expected. ‘

“I didn’t think we’d beat West
Virginia and Connecticut. They’d both
beat us during the year,” said Pitt Coach
Dave Sobal.

Pitt made up a lot of ground on its
competition since those early and mid-
season meets. This time, West Virginia
had 207 points, Connecticut had 215,
and Pitt was just behind in eighth place
with 221. ‘ -

“It feels good to be that close, bu
then it feels bad because you were that
close and you know you could’ve done
it,” Sobal said.

Pitt was led by Angie Martin, who
ﬁnished 35th in 18:06. She spent much
of the race running alongside 39th-place
ﬁnisher Stephanie Ellsworth, who ran
the race in 18:12. The stronger Ellsworth

, led Martin up the hills, but Martin used

her speed to catch up going downhill.
Most of the time difference between
them was a result of the sprint in the last
200 meters. .

“That was a great race for Angie and

a pleasant surprise for all of us,” Sobal
said. “It’s a good feeling when you can
work together with your teammates like
that.”

Cornell slide tackles women's soccer

Jan Dryburgh

 

Genna Terranova scored the only goal 7

early, and goalkeeper Mary Beth Bell
secured a shutout as the Cornell Big Red
handed the Lady Panthers a tough 1-0 loss
on the road. ’

Cornell dominated the game in shots
at 25-3 (Terranova outshot Pitt 6-3), but
Head Coach Roland Sturk believed his
team played very well.

‘.‘We didn’t play as well as we did
against Syracuse, and if we would have
we probably could’ve won,” Sturk said.
“They weren’t much better than us, but the
cold weather proved to be a problem for
us. Some of the girls had trouble getting

  

loose.”

Pitt goalkeeper Sarah Stout registered
nine saves and played her best game of the
season, .according to Sturk.

“Sarah showed a marked irnprove-
ment for the game and played extremely
well, probably her best all year,” he said.

Sturk said he is not at all disappointed
with the team’s effort, just the results. _

“Right now we are just good enough
to lose,” he said. “Other teams have set the
tone for the game early and we have kept
pace, but we are just underneath the sur-
face. We can’t quite get over the hump.” «

Terranova scored at the 14:55 mark in
the ﬁrst half on a breakaway that brought
out goalie Sarah Stout to challenge the
shot. Stout went low as Terranova went

high from about six yards to the left of
Stout and scored the contest’s only goal.

Pitt’s record dropped to 2-16 in its
opening season, but the team is gaining
some idea of what the competition will be
like in the future. Cornell raised its season
record to 7-8.

‘The level of competition is so
intense, and other teams are a lot 
stronger than us at this’ point. It gives us
something to work on in the off-season.”
Sturk said. “We will be spending a good
bit of time on strength and conditioning
for the upcoming year.” .

inaugural season of play Wednesday night
when Robert Morris cruises over to Pitt
Stadium for a showdown at 7:15 p.m.

Men's soccer
finishes with five

straight shutouts

The Pitt men’s soccer team ended its 1996
season on a high note with a 1-0 Big Etst VlCtO-

‘ry against Syracuse on Sunday at Pitt Stadium.
The Panthers won their ﬁnal ﬁve games — all.

by shutouts — to conclude the season with an
overall‘ record of 8-7-2, and 2-7-2 in the'Big
East. With the defeat, the Orangemen fell to 9-
6-2 overall, 5-5-1 in the Big East.

The only goal of the game occurred at
36:10 in the first half, when Pitt senior Keith
Hoetzlein scored on an assist from junior Greg
Hoolihan.

Pitt outshot Syracuse, ' 19-11, and the
Panthers’ senior goalkeeper, Adam Spitzer, who
played every minute of every game for Pitt in
1995 and 1996, made ﬁve saves to earn the 25th
shutout of his career, an all—time Pitt record.

iPiH could save S, but
-itwon't even listen

As usual, it seems that Pitt is a bit behind the game, and this
time we’re not talking about football. .

The service employees who keep this university running
have been working without a contract for 10 months, and every
time mediators and union representatives try to get the admin-
istration to set a new negotiations date, they are delayed. The
last two times contracts were up for negotiations, Pitt stalled for
18 and 22 months, respectively. This is completely unaccept-
able.

These workers leaﬂetted _Thursday’s game because they
had no choice —— it was the only_way their voices would be
heard. They said they need others to call and express concern
because Pitt didn’t listen when the workers expressed their own
concern. ‘ t
The next twist this particular saga takes is amusing, in a

sick sort of way. The new medical insurance plan these work- '
I ers are pushing for would save Pitt money. That’s right. Not

only do workers want a 3—percent wage increase, but they’re
proposing a way to pay for it. Pitt would save $100 per month
per person under the new plan, money that could be spent
increasing the wages of these service employees. And yet Pitt
won’t listen. The university should embrace this new plan,
rather than having to lay off some workers in order to pay for
wage increases for others. ~

We at The Pitt News have noticed a general lack of concern
for workers doing their jobs without a contract. We saw this ear-
her this year with the ‘Pitt Police, another essential group that
Pitt has swept under the rug. Here’s a news ﬂash: workers with
employers who are actually concerned with the job stability and
conditions of their workers are more loyal, and theseworkers
— gasp — work harder and better. Pitt needs to wake up and
appreciate the work employees do, rather than taking it for
granted like they always seem to. .

The football team came alive Thursday night and delivered
a big win. The administration needs to do the same.

Ethics: it's not i

'-x -:v~<-

On this, the most important elec-
tion day in a good while, I shall refuse
to talk about the election. Instead, I’d
rather talk about something that is
commonly overlooked, especially in
the ﬁeld of engineering. Ethics are a
primary concern for every human
being, not just goodie-goodies and
religious fanatics. Every action, how-
ever seemingly irrsigniﬁcant, has ethi-
cal implications.

This year, I’m helping lead a
group of freshman honors engineering
students in discussions about ethics in
engineering. When I speak of this,
many look at me with an puzzled
expression. They say, “What does
engineering have to do with ethics?”
They wonder whether applied science
can be anything but amoral.
Engineering is far ﬁom being amoral.
The key word in the term “applied sci-
ence” is “appli ” When a civil engi-‘
neer applies the rules of physics to
design a bridge, does he have a moral
responsibility to make sure that the
construction and existence of the
bridge have a minimum impact on the
surrounding ecosystem? I think he
does. What if the same engineer were
forced by the corporate hierarchy to
cut costs and round comers on spend-
ing at the expense of these environ-
mental concerns? If he follows his
environmental morals, then he may
lose his job and be unable to provide
for his family. This is a true moral
dilemma in which engineers of every
discipline ﬁnd themselves entangled.

On a more general note, all scien-
tiﬁc laws have applications which can

ust for the philisophical crowd

either be morally good or morally evil.
A trite, yet perfect, example is atomic
ﬁssion VV1th this knowledge, the engi-
neercan design abomb tokillmﬂlions
of people or a power plant to supply
millions of households with 'life—giv-
ing heat This much can be said ofthe
applications of any scientiﬁc principle.
Newton’s projectile motion equations

or diagram the path of 
Another interesting ethical con-
cern in engineering is the concept of
planned obsolescence. Plarmed obso-
lescence involves designing a product
to fail just after the warranty expires so
that the consumer will be forced to
buy the more expensive new model.
Companies like Gilette and Chrysler
are masters of this idea Gilette could
easily design a titanium-alloy razor
that would last forever and stay sharp
_ for a super-long time, but that would
defeat its-short-tenn, greedy purpose
of generating revenue. I used to own a
Dodge Dynasty . (1988, made by
Chrysler Corp.). My auto-body repair-
man warned me that at about 70,000
miles the transmission and a few other
parts were likely to break down. Sure

enough, .a week after the 70,000 mile I

mark, the transmission, the fuel pump,
and the head gasket all needed
replacement. And of course, many
auto cornpaniesmakethe mostmoney
from overpricing these replacement
parts. Are these practices ethical? I

thinkthatthispolicydupesthecon-'

sumer with attractive deals and war-
ranties into thinking that he is making
an investment, while in actuality he is
pandering to the greed of multimil-
lionaires. The immorality lies in the
factthat the pmpose ofthe design is

not quality, but instead is a money-
making scheme that not only takes
advantage ‘of consumers but also
slows technological progress to a

_ crawl.

How is progress slowed?
Companies do not release new
designs until the last oneisrnilked, not
to mention never designing quality
products in the ﬁrst place, because
when things break, we in our inﬁnite
wisdom will buy another. There are
companies who do not accept this
tenet. Cutco, Inc. makes knives that
are guaranteed for a lifetime. These

knives are engineering marvels — ,

they are ergonomically designed and
are made to last forever. Interestingly
enough, the company is doing quite

well and does not need the money-

grubbing tactics of planned obsoles-
cence to stay aﬂoat. '

Is incompetence unethical? If'an
engineer screws up while building a
bridge and it collapses, killing people
in the process, is be morally responsi-
ble? I think engineers must be sure, to
the best of their abilities, that when
they design something, it is entirely
safe. In 1986, incompetence of certain

THE Pl'I"I' NEWS

hy haven't th Republicans got
a prayer? They can't campaign! P

Pittsburgh.

 

Third in a series of columns
on Campaign ‘96.

A.few months ago, one of
my co—workers, a Republican,
jokingly predicted that GOP

presidential candidate Bob
Dole would be on oxygen by
the end of the campaign.

He hasn’t needed the oxy-
gen so far, buthis campaign is
certainly on life support and is
expected to expire tomorrow.

However, try telling that to
Republican operatives here,
who will tell you Dole still has
a chance. (Not to mention my
colleague Matt Mills — so I
won’t.)

A couple of weeks ago, I
visited Allegheny County GOP
headquarters in the McNal1y
Building downtown and spoke
with David Hamstead, chair-
man of the county committee.
Suggesting that interest in Dole
was high here, he said, “We’ve
had over 300 people come in
for yard signs, in addition to
[the] 2,800 I’ve given to my
committee members.” (I won-
der what they did with them —
I’ve seen not one Dole—Kemp
sign in Swissvale, where I live,
or elsewhere in the eastern sub-
urbs.)

To my surprise, on his desk
were a few “Rock the Vote”

buttons from ’ up, but since
MTV’s voter it . didn’t go

stop at Pitt, building, I
and I asked ended up
him about how overshooting

“Less than there knows ‘

half,” he admitted.

Anyway, at the end of our
conversation, I mentioned I
would be flying to Kansas the
weekend before the election,
and. he askedme, “Staying for
the victory party?” I said no, as
I knew I’d be back Sunday
evening. (Besides, I didn’t
have the heart to tell him I
think it’ll be a retirement party.
Possibly,Va wake.) -,

'As it was, last‘ Sunday I
realized just why Dole doesn’t

That day after church, I
decided to visit the local cam-
paign offices just to check it
out, hoping that I would get a
chance to talk to some volun-

values, were out working on/

the Lord’s Day.

As it was, I did at least get
a peek into the office, and it
dawned on me why Dole was
doomed. The lobby featured
three issues of Time, one with
Hillary Clinton’s face and the
caption reading, “The Truth

no pun intended — how are’

people without wheels sup-
posed to get there and back at

As it was, I ended up just

missing one bus in town and
had over an hour to kill before
the next one, so I-burned’ the
time with the Democrats. That
was fun, as I managed totalk to
a few of the campaign workers
there and even caught a little of
the Steeler game. But I’d been
there before. '

The bus eventually showed

that four blocks in the North
Hills can be awfully long. So
after walking south about 15
minutes and dodging some traf-
fic in the process, I found the
place. And guess what? It was
closed! V

I probably should have fig-
ured. I mean, we all know that
Republicans are spending their
Sundays in church or with their
families and couldn’t bring
themselves to campaign for
their candidate. Of course,
those atheist, liberal
Democrats, who reject moral

Trent Lott and other politi-
cians), not to mention the issue
of the Star that broke that
story in the first place. On top
of that, posted in the window
was a story in Investor’s
Business Daily . titled -“White
House’s 39 Scandals.”

What’s my point? Bereft of
any new ideas, as Clinton-Gore
press secretary Alison
Schwartz suggested, the GOP
apparently tried to promote
Dole, never accused of being
suave and telegenic, as the
“anti-Clinton.” (In fairness to
the Republicans, the president
did get elected by swiping
some of their platform.)

The proposed 15 percent
tax cut, emphasizing his con-
version to supply-side econom-
ics, went nowhere. The attacks
on Bill Clinton’s “character”
actually hurt Dole, especially
with recent revelations that he
himself had had two affairs
while married to his first wife.
Not only that, eight years ago,
he took money, albeit a much
smaller amount, from the ‘same
Indonesian family who recently
caused a major headache for
the Democrats. And‘ don‘t for-
get the Cuban national who was
also financing his campaign.

All Dole can say at this
point is, “I’_m not Bill Clinton!”

Ain’t that the truth.

And '.that’s why he’s dead

Thinking I had received enough enter-
tainment for one Thursday evening, I
became aware that the van hadn’t
moved in a while.

Ilooked to the front of the van just
in time- to see one of the Pitt elite board
the bus. Although it took a minute or
two, the student was finally able to lit-
erally crawl up the steps, down the
aisle. on all fours, and eventually hoist
himself up into a seat. Then, he leaned
‘against the window and proceeded to
puke a substance that smelled a little
like aviation fuel and whiskey onto the
window, the seat, and himself. Looking
around in desperation, he turned to me.
Without rubber gloves and a gas mask,
all I could do was‘ shrug-my shoulders,
and the van took off.

I returned to looking out'the»win—

Van Call and hear that there is,
