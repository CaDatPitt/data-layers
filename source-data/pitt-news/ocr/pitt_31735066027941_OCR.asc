Sexual assault occurs on campus

By Kathleen Scanlon
News Editor '

February 1994 to June

Sexual assault can’t happen
to you.

If you live in a world where
men and women never have
problems communicating with
each other.

In a society where nobody
claims to have the right to
force anything on anyone.

On a campus where nobody
abuses alcohol to the point
that they become blind to
boundaries, to the point that
their minds turn to

 

of sexual assault on campus,
Ruiz said, is to recognize
those myths.

Ruiz said some freshmen
women don’t pay much atten-
tion during sexual assault pre-
sentations because they don’t
want to believe that it could
happen to them.

Another myth that can blind
students is that sexual assault
is only a women’s issue, there-
fore only women carry the
responsibility of preventing it,
Ruiz said.

“These myths and stereo-

clouds, to a point where  .-.-  

the word “no”
powerful as air.
But here at Pitt, from '

1995, 23 students
reported to Pitt’s Sexual
Assault Sevices that
they had been sexually
assaulted. Coordinator
Mary Koch Ruiz says
she suspects there were ,_
more than 23 assaults, 
but since the program is  I
relatively new at Pitt, 
many students are not
yet familiar or comfort-
able with it. Over 100
assaults were reported
at the University of
Iowa, where the sexual
assault program is older.

Myths and stereo-
types about sexual
assault can cultivate an
atmosphere on campus
that allows it to happen.

types will keep the students
from opening their eyes and
from looking at sexual assault
in a broader manner,” Ruiz
said.

“And if they would, it
would give them a better
understanding of sexual
assault. It would also help
them to believe that it actually
does happen on this campus.”

Last September, one 19-
year-old Pitt student attended
a fraternity party and was
allegedly assaulted by several
men while she was drunk and
while she had consen-
sual sex with one man.
In February, another
Pitt student went to a
bar and was allegedly
assaulted by a man she
met at the bar while he
escorted her home.
 Since 90 percent of
 sexual assaults involve
alcohol, Ruiz says that
students should avoid
abusing alcohol, as it
 inhibits judgement, as
’_, well as a student’s
ability to resist an
assault or to clearly
expresswhat sexual
actions makes him/her
_. feel uncomfortable.
 “For some of the

are experiencing their

Don't Cut
aid for
students,

says SGB

By Kathleen Scanlon
News Editor

Pitt’s Student Government
Board launched its “Save
Student Aid” campaign last
night with a visit from
Congressman William Coyne,

who told student leaders that

he would fight proposed
financial aid cuts when he
returns to Congress next
week.

“It seems ironic that when
the need for higher education
is at its highest, Washington is
proposing the highest cuts in
history,” said SGB member
Keith Campbell.

Proposals to eliminate pro-
grams such as the Perkins
Loan and the Student State
Incentive Grant (SSIG) have
already passed the House. So
have cuts to Pell grants, and
proposals to eliminate the stu-
dent-loan exemption.

Cuts to Pell grants would
pull the money away from a
quarter of a million students
who would no longer be eligi-
ble for the program. And if the
student-loan exemption disap-
pears, students would have to
start paying interest as soon as
they take out the loans.

in 1920 was handed down to

After all the lanterns were

If you want to et
out of Oaklan 

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

A few blocks between the hustle of Oakland and the
eastern suburbs of Pittsburgh lies Shadyside, a commu-
nity that combines some poor college students and one
of the most affluent shopping areas in the city.

Shadyside is home to undergrads and grad students
from Pitt and Carnegie Mellon University, along with
being home to many families and senior citizens. It is
also home to Walnut Street, where you can find various
high-class shopping stores, such as Ann Taylor, Banana
Republic, The Gap and Victoria’s Secret.

Shadyside starts at the edge of North Oakland, right
past North Craig Street. It covers about 12 blocks until
the beginning of Point Breeze. around Fifth Avenue and
Washington Boulevard.

According to John Henne of the Shadyside Chamber
of Commerce, there are 160 merchants in the restau-
rant, business and retail field in Shadyside.

Two restaurants that have become favorites for many»

Pitt students are Hotlicks and Max and Erma’s, both
located on Walnut Street. The menus have an American
style, with Max and Erma’s’ being the more expensive
of the two.

If you’re looking for some world-class food (and
somebody else is paying), check out Pasta Piatto, right
off Walnut Street. The Italian restaurant is consistently
ranked as one of the best in the city.

There are also plenty of bars for the over—2l crowd.
Most of them are usually heavily populated by graduate
students. Doc’s Place and Le Mardi Gras are two hot
spots.

Along with shopping, eating and drinking, Shadyside
has art galleries, book stores, a National Record Mart
and a hospital.

You can get to Walnut Street by taking a PAT bus,
free with a Pitt ID. Get on the 71 A, B,C, or D bus out-
sidethe William Pitt Union on Fifth Avenue. They run
frequently during the day. If you are walking or biking,

go down Fifth Avenue and make a left on to South L

Negley to reach Walnut Street.

drink too much, which will put them at risk
[because] they’re not thinking clearly. For other indi-
viduals, drinking too much will lower their inhibi-
tions so they may do something they may normally

not do when they’re sober.”

Underclassmen tend to be involved in sexual
assault incidents more than upperclassmen, Ruiz

says, because at this point in their lives, students
trust others more easily and have more difficulty
expressing themselves assertively. But in order to
combat sexual assault on campus, both women and
men need to pick up the burden to communicate
more directly with each other and to learn to respect

others’ boundaries.

Assumptions should never be made about what

another person wants, Ruiz said. At the same time,
men and women should say clearly when something
makes them uncomfortable.

“I think that people aren’t open about what they
want or what they desire and what they don’t want,”
Ruiz said. “Therefore a lot of assumptions are made,

a lot of interpretations are made. Usually those are

incorrect. And that leads to a volatile situation.”

SGB

‘From page 1

Campbell said.

But students can fight these propos-
als by registering to vote, writing to
Congressmen and organizing at rallies
with other campuses. SGB members
invited leaders from various student
groups last night to join the coalition.

In the past, Campbell said, students
were told to vote because of their
responsibility to actively participate in
a democratic society. But now specific
issues threaten to weigh students down
economically, so they have a_ more
urgent reason to vote.

“To get what we need as students, we
must vote in large numbers right now,”
Campbell said. “If we can say that 70,
80 percent or all students are voting,
we can get what we need.”

Coyne, who sits on the budget and

the ways and means committees,
assured students he has heard their
concerns and that he and his
Democratic colleagues will not allow
the largest proposed education cuts in
history to become reality.

“That will not happen in the 104th
Congress,” he said. '

Also at the meeting, Campbell laid
out the benefits of a direct-lending pro-
gram that the U.S. Department of
Education has said it hopes to phase
schools into. According to the Office
of Management and Budget, the direct-
lending program would save taxpayers
money by eliminating the middle men,
which in this case are the banks and
guaranty lenders, Campbell said.

In the direct-lending program, the
U.S. Department of Education gives
money directly to the school, which

gives money to students. The student
then pays the loan back to the
Department of Education.

Direct-lending would speed up the
loan process because the money would
not have to weave its way through the
middle channels, Campbell said. About
five percent of schools have chosen to
participate in the program and it is up
to each individual school to choose to
get involved. Pitt does not participate,
he said.

Campbell said that many in Congress
would like to gut the direct-lending
program, but students should fight for
its survival.

“We think that this direct-lending
program deserves a fair shot,”
Campbell said.

Other leaders pledged their support '

to SGB’s efforts, including Mike-Frank

Epitropoulos, president of the Graduate
and Professional Student Association
(GPSA). The proposed cuts to graduate
financial aid programs will narrow the
possibilities for current undergraduates
to secure funded graduate positions, he
said.

Many backed Campbell’s assertion
that voting and aggressively contacting
congressmen through letters will save
some student aid.

“Congressmen do listen and they lis-
ten to those who vote,” said Clarence
Curry, assistant to the vice chancellor
of student and public affairs.

The House version of the budget will
go to the Senate next week. The Senate
promised to be less harsh on education
cuts, but “how less harsh depends on
what we do as students,” Campbell
said.

‘ T'h‘e'y''made love in an unusual

the Unseam’dShakespeare

‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore , found
themselves behind a sheer curtain
stretched diagonally across a
minute stage, in front of checker-
board islands of tables that other
characters had just fought among 
tables where the audience was
seated in Luciano’s Coffeehouse.
This is the perfect example of
Pittsburgh theater. ’

It doesn’t have the funding, the

bounty it lacks in these areas, it
makes up for in enthusiasm and
experimentation. Directors around

the shows performed here using
local talent are very heartfelt, alive
performances. I mean these
actors/directors/designers are here
at this time for a reason; not
because they are working for the
money, but because they enjoy
their craft, they want to shape their
given art, and mostly because
they’re spending their nights the
way they want. Can you say you're
doing the same?

I am so lucky.

For two years, I had free tickets
to preview/review/profile the most
alive, visceral art form in the ‘burgh.
I can’t possibly condense the mind-
candy l gained from this experience
into this short piece, but I can give a
brief overview, an opinion, of what
you can expect from this particular
art, in this particular microcosm.

Pitt Theater holds open general
auditions at the beginning of every
year to give Joe College a shot at
their mainstage productions, (four
per year) and possibly their labs.

veterans), but this is a great,
vital experience for anyone who
would like to eventually perform
locally, and occasionally there
are the breakthrough first-
timers. Pretty much all you need
is a non-classical monologue
and a little guts. Other local
audition schedules are usually
available in the free newsweek-
lies. Theater labs at Pitt tend to
be a little riskier and fresher
than the mainstages (last year’s
Jeffrey not included). Friday
nights, crowds up to and well
surpassing 150 people turn out
for Friday Night lmprovs at The
Pit theater on Bouquet Street.
The cost is about two bucks, but
it’s interactive, creative and
never predictable, unlike — and
I've been there myself — the
local bar scene after about three
weeks. ‘

There are a handful of really
standout, talented actors to be
found in Pitt productions, and
watching them work dialogue
into a kind of music is worth the
ticket prices. l’ve watched them
grow more faceted, and have
seen new faces come in and
blow the others out of the
proverbial pool. It's a great time
when you discover them.

The New Works Festival
staged at the City Theater on
the South Side in early
September bffers an exciting
look at where the the local direc-
tion of theater is moving. lt’s a

Kids

' Directed by Larry Clark

Courtesy of Harmony
Korine’s down-wit’-it dialogue
and Larry Clark’s penchant for
skate-punks, Thrasher-
approved fashion and his
sometimes verité camera, Kids
is a hip, hip-hop condom ad
with 90 minutes of Lou
Barlow’s favorites: a tribe here,
a sebadoh there and a beastie
everywhere. it’s a powerful
yarn for the jimmyhat, a rule for

.- the rubbers, a steadfast yo! for

the skins and a hurrah for the
latex. Health Departments
across the country couldn’t

 have asked for a better promo.

And as a safer-sex commer-

, c_ial, I give Kids all my props.

 Clark’s done what Dazed and .

Confused couldn’t — he’s
given us a highly watchable
film minus all the cheeky pot-
talkand the characters’ corny
LSD trail-watching (wow, like,
that movie really, like, fucked
with me). Clark’s raw, where
Linklater pussyfoots. We’d
never find the opening shot, 30
seconds of sucking face, or a
devilish virgin-surgeon on a
Linklater screen.

While Spin sells Kids as sub- ‘

versive, see “The Movie They
Don’t Want’ You To See”, and
The Village Voice snarls “The
Movie America Deserves,” I
gotta say I was surprised I
wasn’t more surprised by Kids.
Much of what drives the plot,

 

Simply presen

FOR LESS!

 

 
  

a d all of what stirs the”ten-
sion, is AIDS anxiety. Take that
bottled framework away and
what you got is a lively hodge-
podge skate/party flick.

Harmony Korine’s story, which

he wrote at the age of 19, fol-
lows two teen punks through
the streets of Manhattan on a
school-free summer day. Safe-

_ sex for Korine’s leading char-

acters, Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick)
and Casper (Justin Pearce), is
having sex with virgins. “No
diseases, no loosey—goose
pussy, no skank,” reasons
Telly. Early in the film we learn
Jenny (Chloe Sevigny) has
tested positive for the HIV
virus, which means Telly is
also HIV-positive because she
has only had sex with Telly.
But Telly is the virgin-surgeon,
out for more conquests by the
day’s end. It's Jenny's chase to
warn him before it istoo late
and Tel|y’s infected another.
But as progressive as Kids’

condom politics are, Clark’s

good girl/bad guy scapegoat
method of handling AIDS
transmittal misses the mark. By
a long shot. In Clark’s outdated

seix-ed world, virginity is some-

thing males steal. Or deflower!
Rarely is girlhood given any
credit in Kids. When they’re not
being dumbed by smoothie
Telly, they’re dropped from the
film. Boys would seem to make
a better title (Kids, for the most
part, is a gang of guys out vir-
gin-hopping). Ruby (Rosario
Dawson), the only girl who
possessed even an ounce of
attitude, gets a mere five min-
utes before she’s dropped in
favor of the victimized Jenny
and her hunt for Telly. For the
most part,’ Clark’s girls are
naive and pure and wear the
halos in this mythical
Manhattan. When posh apart-
ment -dwelling girls make out
with flophouse fallen angels
like Telly, you can be sure
someone better get AIDS,
Clark seems to say.

So it’s 1995, and we’re still
hot on the Puritan-trail looking
for scapegoats to explain the
spread of HIV. Thanks but no
thanks, Larry. I sat waiting,
unsatisfied, for the first out-
and-out fuck scene, -where
both guy and girl lose their

 

(Fifth & Atwood)

 
 
  

  
   
   
 

cool, ditch the condom and the
shit hits the fan from there. But
we never get that reality. it’s a

, bunch of hip-hopped cutesy
; ines to show how dumb Girl
E; #1 and Darcy (Yakira Peguero)
 are, with Telly present to
“exploit” the virgin territory.‘

Watch for Casper’s final
unconscionable act and you’ll
have Clark’s Puritanical point
nailed home. And you’ll know
precisely who’s guilty, who’s
innocent, who’s the criminal
and who’s the victim in Clark’s
finger-wagging HIV caper.



AMP

Kids is nonetheless a power-

ful, uncompromising film. it’s
one of the very few of it’s teen-
sex brand that attempts to con-
front the problems we kids of
the ‘90s face. Many heads will
be left a-thinking when it’s all
said and done, Lou. Barlow’s
soundtrack is one of the best
put together and Clark’s
superb direction with-non-
actors is not-to.-be-missed. *

There is a hidden part of
everyone that is_ a little impul-
sive. The Friday Night lmprov
Group gives you a chance to
answer this calling. This group
of Pitt thespians congregates
every weekend to invite every-
one to join the rituals held at
The" Pit. The night is always
filled with‘ what can only be
described as spontaneous cre-
ative energy set free.
Improvisational exercises pro-
vide an unscratched surface
for any participant with the
impulse to get up and join the

 

assemble in whatever creation
is being developed. There are
never any scripts or stage
directions that structures these
affairs because whatever hap-
pens is entirely up to the audi-
ence. The only guidelines they
follow are there to help you
participate, not to restrict you.
They are as simple as follow-
ing kindergarten rules and pro-
vide a friendly atmosphere for
any improv-virgin. Host Chic
Lieby and coordinators feel
that it is important that people
know this is not theater. But
what may be lmprov’s' most

 

important quality is that people
are persuaded to feel comfort-
able with little failures which
might ariseiifrom constantly
acting on impulses.

Talking with Lieby about the
freakish goings on of this
unbridled affair, I understood
the important skills a person

i attending Friday Night lmprovs

can achieve. The atmosphere
created from a skilled staff of
thespians revolves around
making people feel comfort-
able with themselves in-front of
people. Lieby encourages
attendants not to step on any
creative impulse. People who
have a great time in theater
classes will enjoy the same
type of learningactivities here.

rience,” Lieby has encountered
numerous incidents where par-
ticipants have been able to
overcome their fear of people
through the audience’s motiva-
tion. Lieby also confided to me
that improvisational exercises
have also been responsible for
improving communication
skills. “‘The coordinators act as

   

monitors and let the audience
invent their own creations
through improv activities that
are used to coax people out of
their seats onto the stage,”

says Lieby. To add to the fren-"

exceptional nights, bands and

' Speaking with Steve Wilson,
veteran Friday Night improvi--
sationalist, I am convinced that
this has got to be an exciting
experience worth checking

thespian, and has worked with
people who have not had any
theater experience. The
improv group is exceptionally
talented in their abilities to
work with the audience, he

and let people know that fail-

er, under-funded theaters in the
area. These theaters sponsor the
plays, and this year alone,
approximately 180 local actors
auditioned for roles. It's about a
block-and-a-half off of East
Carson St. and usually has a
wide menu of choices in a neigh-
borhood setting. While they fea-
ture local talent in all aspects of
the field, they also import a pow-
erful arsenal of actors. I found

,City’s productions to be slightly

more experimental than the aver-
age in the area.

On the North Side, another
major player in ‘burgh theater is
the Pittsburgh Public Theater. It
usually has advertising compara-
ble to the Benedum series of
productions downtown (which, by
the way, is offering Kiss of the
Spider Woman with Chita Rivera
this fall). The Public tends to
favor its connectioniwith local
playwright August Wilson by
putting on his award-winning
plays as often as possible.
These plays are full of life in
Pittsburgh, with recurrent refer-
ences and local flavor as strong
as a Primanti’s sandwich. It has
a solid line-up of contemporary
productions scheduled for this
season. I’m partial to the spring’s
power trio Sweeney Todd,
Arcadia and Jittney.

Local universities like Point
Park (which crosses over into
Pittsburgh Playhouse Theater),
Robert Morris, Carlow,
Chat_ham’s Saltworks and
Carnegie Mellon offer a wide
range of local talent, usually
staging the traditional, family-
style mainstages. Carnegie

More wasted money

Do you remember what it was like, right after puberty set in,
when you felt more awkward than a three-legged giraffe? How
it felt like something similar to the hunchback of Notre Dame?
You noticed when you stepped back and took a look at yourself
that you thought you had a horrible image problem, right? So
what did you do about it? Did you struggle through your image

. crisis with what resources you had, or did you spend exorbitant

amounts of money you didn’t have to begin with on an “image
consultant”?

The answer to this question (at least for most of us) should be
blatantly clear to everyone, except of course to the Powers That
Be here at Pitt.

Pitt has run up an extraordinary list of accomplishments in the
spending department lately. Despite the fact that tuition rates
continue to rise, salaries and raises are frozen and hiring is on
hold because Pitt’s budget is so tight, the university has contin-
ued to find ways to squander away the money we pay every
semester.

Let’s look at just a couple of the more ridiculous ways our
money is being spent. A giant “Pitt” got added to the sidewalk

* in front of the William Pitt Union this summer. Youcan now

honestly say you got to walk all over Pitt during your stay here.
Other than that there’s really no reason for it being there, or for
spending our money on it.

Hmm  We are also graced with a new set of automatic doors
for the Cathedral of Learning. It is definitely good that the uni-
versity is complying with ADA regulations by installing auto-
matic doors, but these new ones were installed to replace the set
of automatic doors put in last year and which worked for
approximately one week. The other interesting thing is, the inte-
rior doors are the same open-it—yourself doors that have always

_ been there. So if you can’t open the door, you can only go as far

as the entrance and that is where you are to stay. Sorry, our
money hasn’t opened that second set of doors yet.

The latest instance of money wasting here at Pitt is the recent
announcement that Pitt has enlisted the aid of an “image consul-
tant” in order to improve the negative public perception of our
university. Pitt was only ranked 93rd out of 100 in a recent
Money magazine survey of college best—buys. The consultant
from Northwestern University will be paid to study this school
in order to come up with ways to improve that perception.

There are many better ways to spend the apparently scarce
money that Pitt is going to spend on this consultant. While we
applaud Pitt for finally realizing this school has an image prob-
lem, a consultant will not come up with anything that any per-
son with some common sense and creativity couldn’t come up
with.

Why not sponsor a contest for the best ways to improve the
school, and let students have a chance to win some of the money
they need to pay for this school? Or perhaps ﬂy a hot-air balloon
around the country dropping propaganda bombs? Or, just
maybe, what about addressing some of the problems that exist at
the university, instead of sending up publicity smoke-screens to
pacify the masses, like the 25—member alcohol-awareness com-
mittee created after the drinking-related death of a Pitt student
which has never actually done anything. Just a few suggestions.

How affirmative is the action?

1993 in the
Denver United States:
Dash -31 percent of
all black fam-

ilies lived below poverty level
compared to 9 percent of white
families.

-7 percent of black heads of
household had completed four
or more years of college com-
pared to 15 percent of white
heads of household.

-2.8 percent of blacks com-
mitted “serious crimes” (rape,
murder, etc.) compared to 0.73
percent of whites.

It is often argued that since -

such disparities still exist,
affirmative action should also
still exist. This point of view
may not be correct.

There are two general issues
involved with AA. First, it is
not obvious to some people
that the government should
even be in the business of
explicitly resolving social
-injustices. I believe and will
assume here that it is in soci-
ety’s benefit for government to
resolve these injustices. The
second issue is, of course, how
to best resolve these inequities.

First let me define precisely
what I mean by “Affirmative
Action.” I am not merely talk-
ing about “non-discriminato-
ry” practices. AA refers to the
policy of directly decreasing
racial or social inequities by
providing some type of bene-
fits to a person because that
person is racially underrepre-
sented in some way. For
instance, a common practice
among many universities is to
relax the academic entrance
and/or probation requirements
for minority students.

Clearly in some ways these
sort of policies benefit racial
equity. However, AA also cre-
ates effects which limit the
degree of racial equality possi-
ble and therefore may be coun-
terproductive to the cause.

AA benefits society because
it provides a direct means for
at least a few minorities to
achieve quality educations and
good jobs — an end that is

otherwise virtually unreach-
able for most minorities.
However, because these
minorities were afforded easier
access to their jobs and educa-
tions, they stand to be resented
or, at the very least, not
respected by their mainstream
peers. Furthermore, minorities
know that they are being treat-
ed specially because of their
minority status. Regardless of
how justified this special treat-
ment may be, many minorities
must know that they have not
personally earned their
achievements, and they may
have less self-respect for their
own abilities and maybe less
motivated than if they had not
received special treatment.
These effects together conspire
to deepen the division between
minorities and non-minorities
in general, thus actually per-
petuating racism and social
segregation. It is therefore evi-
dent that AA cannot remain a
permanent fixture in U.S soci-
ety and fully serve its goals.

It is necessary to consider
the heart of this problem.
Consider African Americans
in particular. The true problem
is that American blacks are
caught in a self-perpetuating
social cycle. As a social class
of people, they have at least
four major barriers to general
social prosperity: The first
three are characterized by the
three sets of statistics opening
this letter. The final barrier is
the fact that black culture is
segregated from the main-
stream culture.

These four barriers not only
make social success nearly
unachievable for a typical
black American alone, but
they also serve as excuses for
the white mainstream to
remain socially segregated
from blacks. There is little
way, without government
intervention, for future black
Americans to overcome these
barriers, because the barriers
are self-reinforcing.

Here is where AA has really
been useful. A few blacks

have benefited from AA,

despite the side—effects of the _
program. Those beneficiaries ‘

now have decent jobs and
many live in upper middle-
class suburban neighborhoods.

Their children, therefore, rep- ‘

resent the first generation (or
at least, say, the first 1/4 of a
generation) of black
Americans without the first
three barriers !' However, if
this generation continues to
accept AA handouts. they will
never overcome the final barri-
er, and racism will continue to

be perpetuated in society.’

Furthermore, AA will mostly
only benefit these black
Americans anyway (as
opposed to the ones who really
need help), because these peo-

ple are more educated and are

in a better position to take
advantage of the benefits.

I think of AA much in the
same way as I think of the
“starter” in an automobile. The
starter allows your car engine
to initiate the internal combus-
tion cycle by infusing the sys-
tem with short bursts of “artifi-
cial” current from the car bat-
tery. These initial bursts of
current are inefficient, and
indeed, if one were to try to
actually operate the engine
using only the starter mecha-
nism, the engine would never
run properly —— i.e. the cycle
would not be initiated.
Similarly, if one were to turn
the key on for a brief instant
and then turn it off, the cycle
would not have a chance to
catch. The question the United
States is now faced with is,
“Have we turned the key long
enough?” I don’t know the
answer to that question. Of
course, no one really does;
although, apparently some
people (for instance the
University of California) feel
that we have. All I know for
certain is that some day we’ve
got to turn off the starter and
let the old engine run itself.

 UCLA on Saturday on ABC.
 Until then, we will have to

analyze the less-than-prize
fight here at Pitt Stadium
Saturday night.

Both the Pitt Panthers and
Washington State Cougars
are lookingfor a season-
opening win, Th-e1Panthers
have opened the seas_on at
home 173 times inuthe last 20
years and have gone 9-4.
Washington State has left
Pullman for unfamiliar open-
ers only nine times since
l975. and have recorded a 5-4
mark. _

Entering the game a three-
point favorite, the Cougars
are coming _off a win over
Baylor in the Alamo Bowl
10_-3.--On the other side, the
Panthers are looking to snag
their first bowl bid since
Mike Gottfried took Pitt to
the illustrious John Hancock;
Bowl in 1989.

Without further ado, here is
the Pitt-Washington State
Tale of the Tape. ,

Quarterback — John Ryan
vs. Chad Davis

Both signal-callers are
fresh off great ‘94 seasons.
Davis started all 11 games for
WSU and was named the
MVP of the Alamo Bowl.
Davis threw for 2,299 yards
with six interceptions, includ-
ing only two in his last l0

' games;

John Ryan took over for an
deteriorating Sean Fitzgerald
late in the season last year
and led the Panthers to two
victories in their final three
games. .

Although Davis’ middle
name is Erin, he still gets the
nod over Ryan. Advantage:
WSU ’

Running Backs — Billy
West vs. Derek Sparks

Filling in for often befallen
Curtis Martin against Ohio
U., West rushed for 226
yards. Unlike many 1980s
bands, West was not a one—hit
wonder. In fact, he ended the
season as the Big East
Offensive Player of the Year.

Derek Sparks carried the
ball 119 times for only 312
yards in 1994. Sparks simply
does not have the talent that
West possesses, but he does
enjoy traveling, music and
swimming. He may have an
advantage over West if this
were a singles ad, but'it’s a
football game. Advantage:

.; By the time this college football season

winds down, these record-breaking Panther
pass catchers will be forgotten names.
The super-speedy split end that will cause
 all this forgetfulness among Panther fans is
' senior All-American candidate Dietrich
Jells.
Jells needs 22 receptions and 51 yards to
become Pitt’s all-time leader in both cate-
gories.
“I didn’t start thinking about the yardage
record until last year, when I was told I was
closing in on it,” Jells said. “The reception
record seemed very far-fetched at the time.”
What once seemed far-fetched has now
become a given for Jells, whose 4.43 speed
in the 40, 36.5-inch vertical leap and 500-
pound squat have left opposing defensive
backs gasping for breath and reaching for
their jock straps the last three seasons.
“At first I was primarily a long-ball threat,
but I’ve worked very hard on running pre-
cise routes and having soft hands,” Jells
said.
“It’s amazing to see how much Dietrich
has improved his catching abilities since
I’ve been here,” said wide receivers coach
Steve Bird. “I’m as confident now with him
going over the middle as I am with him
going deep.”
  , . During 1991, Jells’ freshman year, the
Ja nox/Staff Photographer long bomb was his specialty. He caught 12
Pitt wide receiver Dietrich J ells is only 51 yards away from breaking passes for 339 yards. That comes to a whop-

II-time mark

during his sophomore year, Jells responder‘ A

with the most prolific single-season or

catching the pigskin in Pitt’s 106-year foot- i

ball history.

Jells snagged a Pitt record 55 passes for
another Pitt record 1,091 yards, becoming
the first Panther player ever to gain over
1,000 yards through the air in a single sea-
son.

“When I first got to Pitt, I was reminded
how good I wasn’t,” Jells said. “By my sec-
ond year I was showing people how good I
was.”

Against Rutgers, Jells broke another

record when ex-Panther and current Buffalo 
Bill, Alex Van Pelt, connected with him on a _ '

91-yard touchdown pass. Jells caught 184

yards worth of passes that game, which I

ranks second all-time on the sing1e—game
yardage list for Pitt. Who’s first? That
record fell during last year’s Pitt -West
Virginia donnybrook when Jells eclipsed his
previous mark with a 225-yard performance.

After earning a starting‘ spot because of '

injuries, Jells’ junior year was cut short after
only appearing in three games. He received
a medical redshirt.

Jells said of his injury, “I knew I had to be
stronger to come back and that’s what I’ve
been working on the most since then, my
strength.”

Jells returned to the Pitt lineup in 1994
and played in all 11 games. He caught 35
passes for 613 yards and four touchdowns.

Entering the 1995 season, Jells appears to
have things figured out.

“If I’m going into games where I’m being
double—covered, that means that Curtis
Anderson will be there to step up. When he
starts to get big yardage they won’t be able
to double—cover me anymore,” Jells said.

ball game,” Majors said. “It would give us a
great boost. All first games are important,
every game is important, but getting off to a
good start is certainly a tremendous plus.

“And with the good things that are happening
around here with our facilities, our recruiting
outlook and our summer camp — we need to
win. Getting off to a good start couldn’t be a
better boost to the overall program.”

A season-opening win would indeed be a big
boost to the program, but it’s no easy task.
Washington State is fresh off an 8-4 season
and, more importantly, a 10-3 win in the
Alamo Bowl.

Yes, a bowl game.

The key bowl ingredient that Pitt has been
missing, and WSU possesses, is defense. Last
year the Cougars were ranked second in the
nation in total and scoring defense (Miami was
first in both). However, WSU lost eight defen-
sive starters. . .

Tumulty,_ who’s entering his fifth year here,
said this season’s defense ranks up there with
the ‘91 squad, which had guys like Sean
Gilbert and Keith Hamilton, who are both play-
ing in the NFL now.

“Unity-wise, it’s the best since I’ve been
here,” Tumulty said. “Confidence-wise, we’re _
right up there. And we had a lot of talent my 72%
freshman year. We had 11 guys out there play-
ing some ball.

“We’re really running well. The defensive
line got bigger and faster. Some guys needed to
-lose weight, some needed to gain weight, and I
think we accomplished that.”

Besides speculation, Pitt does have one tan-
gible stat on its side. The Panthers hold a 66-
37-2 record in season openers and has won
seven of its last eight opening games. ‘Pitt’s 30-
28 loss to Texas last season snapped a seven-

°Pitt, page 30

Managing Editor

Here’s the facts: Pitt has won six games in 22
tries the last two seasons. While the Panthers’
offense improved from lO3rd (out of 107
teams) in ‘93 to 41st in total offense last year,
that wasn’t evident in the win—loss column.

Pitt has been deadlocked at the 3-8 mark
under Johnny Majors’ second stint as head
coach.

[Although only winning at a 27 percent clip
during that span, several Pitt players are talk-
ing about a bowl appearance. .

“Whether a bowl game is attainable is another.
story in itself. But if it is, then Pitt needs to win
this Saturday’s season opener against
Washington State — especially when you

that includes Texas, Ohio State, Miami and
Boston College. 1

“This game is so important,” linebacker Tom ‘
Tumulty said. ‘‘All games are important, but to
-come out against Washington State, which is a
great team, and win, would really give our
team "a lot more confidence.”

In fact, Tumulty is one of the catalysts that
heads the bowl charge. He has said several
times a bowl appearance is not just a passing
hope -— it’s reality. And if it’s reality, then it’s
time to put the Panthers’ recent nightmarish
past behind them and move on because reality
will be staring Pitt in its face at Pitt Stadium
come kickoff time.

Although the word “bowl” has never slipped’
through Majors’ lips when talking about his
team, he does sense a sort of urgency to win
the season opener.

of reporters waited.

Davis had just finished throwing
passes while wearing a bright yellow
' jersey which reminded the hard-hitting
defensive backs that Davis was off
limits.

However, the jersey couldn’t protect
him from the barrage of questions he
had answered many times before.

“Do you feel you have to play better
this season after the offense was so
_ impotent last year?”

Davis looked upset
when the scribe asked the
question — as upset as the
normally agreeable junior sig-
nal caller can be.

He tilted his head and
looked at the helmet he held
in his hand and tried — again
-— to refute the idea he had a
bad campaign last year.

“You know, my num-
bers weren’t that bad,” Davis
said with the look of a modest
_ man who was getting sacked
by the responsibility for the
offense’s inability to move the
ball last year.

He’s right.

Davis had good num-
’ bers last season, and coach
 Mike Price hopes his perfor-
_ mance in the Alamo Bowl is a
5 sign of things to come. In that
10-3 victory against Baylor,
V Davis passed 35 times, com-
pleting 27 for 286 yards. All

pass attempts“

Davis’ performances last year, while
not Bledsoesque enough to captivate
Cougar fans, didn’t escape Price’s eye.

“When you look across the nation at
the quarterbacks returning,” Price
said, “Chad Davis will have to be in
the top lO.”

Davis will be better next year, he
and Price said. The University of
Oklahoma transfer spent the off-sea-
son in the WSU weight room increas-
ing his arm strength.

And with Davis’ improvement and
the offensive line bulked up, the
offense is expected to, and thinks it
can, put up better overall numbers in
1995. .

Jay Dumas, Chad Carpenter and
Bryant Thomas, the starting receivers,
also spent the summer in deserted
Pullman (Wash.). They worked in the
weight room with Davis, trying to find
what the Cougars didn’t have last sea-
son — a deep threat.

Last season all of the WSU receivers
who saw considerable playing time
ran the 40 at tight-end pace.

But that’s going to change this sea-
son, Dumas said. Who is the burner
going to be?

“All of us,” Dumas said. He thinks
the receivers have all picked up
enough speed to be
able to go deep this
season. '

If he is right, he says
that will just give the
opposition more to pre-
pare for and will trans-
late into a powerful
offense. Dumas is hop-
ing to conclude his 
career at WSU with 1
another bowl appear-
ance but knows that
will not happen with-
out improvements to
the offensive line and
backfield.

bench press over 400 pounds.

“Those are some strong guys up
front,” Price said.

Senior Marc McCloskey is not just
carrying the pressure of being the
leader of the offensive line, but he also
has the pressure of being an all-Pac-l0
candidate. But, he says those aren’t
the pressures he feels on his Goliath-
size shoulders.

“The only pressure I’m feeling now

is the pressure I put on myself,”_

McCloskey said.

Winning and helping open expan-
sive holes for Derek Sparks and Frank
Madu are the most prominent of those
pressures.

Sparks is thrilled to be running
behind the line that tight end Eric
Moore called the “best line I’ve seen
in the time I’ve played here.”

Sparks said he didn’t really get
going until the Apple Cup last season,
but he is certain that will carry over
into the 1995 season.

Another thing working for the

offense is the departure of the nation’s

second chintziest defense.

“They were the better unit, and they
let us know it last year,” Dumas said.

It’s not easy to forget how bad the Pitt Panther
defense was last season. In Pullman, Wash., it’s

‘_-ff? extremely difficult to forget how dominating the
‘ At}: defensive unit of the Washington State Cougars
,1: was last season.

This is not last season.
After losing eight defensive starters from last

..  season, including first-round draft choice Mark
'_’=i Fields and safety Singor Mobley, the Cougars

. . .  should not expect to build on a defense that fin-
_ gf ished second in the nation in yards allowed and
9;; points allowed. -

The leading returner for head coach Mike

5 Price’s defense is Butkus Award candidate Chris
 Hayes. The senior linebacker was third on the
__  Cougars with 74 tackles. Hayes only stands in at
- .3; 6’0” and tips the scales at a paltry 213 pounds,
1  that’s still eight pounds heavier than David
, 7 Sumner. Despite his small stature, most media

5 experts agree that Hayes will be among the line-

“Defensively, we are starting to look better,”

 Price said. “We can run. We recruited speed.”

The Cougar defensive line enters Pitt Stadium

  on Saturday with only one player with signifi-
 cant playing experience. Defensive end Dwayne

Sanders started eight games last season and was
third on the team with five sacks. The remaining
seven linemen on the depth chart have a com-
bined career total of 20 tackles.

“Sanders is a guy to be looking for,” Price
said. “He’s strong, can run like a deer and he’ll
be an All-American candidate.”

Left cornerback Brian Walker is the only
returning Cougar defensive back that started last
season. His whopping two interceptions and 32
tackles came while playing 12 games. ~

Price said to watch out for returnee Greg
Burns in the secondary. 2

“Burns was a starter for us for three years.-
Last year he sat out, but he’s back this year,”
Price said. .

Despite losing eight players, Washington
State’s defense does not consist of a batch of
wide-eyed freshmen entering college football’s
most renowned stadium.

According to the depth charts, only one fresh-
man will start. Tackle Gary Holmes is the only
freshman or sophomore for that matter in th
starting lineup. ‘

Youth is not the concern; the concern lies with
experience.

As for Johnny Majors and the Pitt Panthers,
their concern lies with the Cougars’ offense, not
the defense.

“He’s really picked it up. He
knows what he has to do as a
leader. Lead by example, not
by talking,” said Bird.

Jells and Anderson might
constitute the fastest starting
receiving core in the Big East,
if not the nation. Both were
members of the Pitt record-
setting 4x2Q0—meter indoor
relay team. 9

Jells also won two straight
lOO—meter titles at the Big
East Outdoor Championships
along with numerous other
track titles.

The business major’s plans
after graduation hope to
include the National Football
League.

“My first priority after I’m
done is to make it to the next
level,” Jells said. “Playing in
the NFL is my dream.”

“Je1ls has more than an
average shot because of his
speed,” Bird said. “But he
needs to learn that if he gets
there, a lot of guys are just as
fast as him.”

Unlike most students leav-
ing college, Jells can fall back
on another career. Plus,
endorsements might come
easier as an Olympic sprinter.

And if Tumulty and compa-
ny are correct, this season
Pitt will snap another streak
— a streak of six consecutive
years of not appearing in 2
bowl game. The Panthers last
received a bowl invitation in
‘89, when they beat Texas
A&M in the John Hancock
Bowl.

Pitt Notes: This is the first
meeting between Pitt and
Washington State. The last
time the Panthers played a

The defense knew all of the
offense’s plays and all 0
their audibles and wouldn’
let the offense execute ll
practice.

But players and coache:
say that has changed this year
and it has shown in scrim-
mages.

Davis led the team up and
down the field in both simu
lated games against the firs
and second team defense.

The difference between
scrimmage standouts and
Saturday stars is huge, but the
Davis-led offense is certain it
has what it takes to be the lat-

ter. -

And while Cougar fans may
not know it, Davis said he
proved it last season.
