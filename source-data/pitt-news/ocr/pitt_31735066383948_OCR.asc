Walker No. 2
On Run List

By JIM LEWIS

Pitt News Staff Writer
Yes, he did have a good
day—102 yards on 17 carries with
three touchdowns——but that didn’t
‘matter. Not that he didn’t
care——-his performance helped Pitt

Temple. He cared about the
team——it’s ' just that for one
afternoon, Elliott.Wa1ker did what
Elliott Walker set out to do four
years ago—become the Panthers’
second leading rusher behind the
infamous Tony Dorsett.

On a harmless eight-yard runup
the middle,_seven plays into the
third quarter, Walker passed
Marshall Goldberg’s 1.957-yard
mark by three to break the only
humanly possible Pitt running re-
cord available to him. I

“It means a lot to me," Walker
stated. “When I ﬁrst came to Pitt,

In Post Watergate Era

By DAN ROSENTHAL
Pitt News Staff Writer

There is no such thing as a

bias-free press in this country, but
what we have is well worth all the
criticism it receives, Benjamin
Bradlee, executive editor of the
Washington Post, said last night.

“There had never been anything
like Watergate before in my era in

: .ashington,’’ Bradleetold a crowd

"‘of more than 300 in a speech at
‘ Oakland's Rodef Shalom Syna-
gogue.
“We’re all still around to talk
about it. though,” he said.

“One ofithe things Richard
Nixon still talks about is how the
press committed ‘a gross violation
of the national security’ by
reporting the bombing of Cam-
bodia,” Bradlee said.

“The term ‘national security’

there were no stories on Chile
crossing one of the national wire
services.

“The answer was not that there
was nothing happening in Chile,”
Bradlee said. “The wire’s Chilean
correspondent was on vacation...so
journalists do have their limita-
tions.”

Bradlee said money is also a
factor.

“My friend Abe Rosenthal
(executive. editor) over at the New
York Times has $27 million to buy
the truth,” he said, “while we (at
the P081) Onlvhave $18 million.”

 

By DAVID STERN

A basic reading, writing and
advising program for students who
scored below 430 on the verbal
section of their Scholastic Aptitude
Test (SAT) has been initiated by
the College of Arts and Sciences
(CAS) this fall.

The national average of verbal
SAT scores has dropped in recent
years. For CAS to maintain its level
of enrollment. students with lower
scores had to be accepted,
according to CAS Dean Robert
Marshall. .

“The College had two choices”,
Marshall said. “We either could
have become more selective, and
felt the effect of the budget crunch,
or we could have maintained our
level of enrollment and brought in

bring cloudy skies thundershowers -- heavy at

students who needed a little more
help.” '
Approximately 250 freshmen
with low SAT scores were selected
and given reading and writing
evaluations on Saturdays in May
and June. These students, Mar-
shall said, were given several
different options. h
Most were advised to join
existing programs such as the
Learning Skills Center or to enter
courses such as the English
Department’s basic writing course.
However 75 of the 250 students
voluntarily opted to take part in an
experimental program, according to
Marshall. S
David Bartholomae. assistant
professor of English, and Anthony
Petrosky. assistant professor of
language communications, devised

i

a six-credit course combining basic
reading and writing skills.

“It’s basically a writing course
with a reading course attached,
Bartholomae said. “We’re trying
not to define the two, though. The
idea is to put them together.”
During half of the class period,

by not running a particular story.

“People are often misled into
thinking that placement, overplay
or underplaying of a story are the
only forms of bias in journalism.
Merely not reporting a story is a
form of bias too.” he said.

“72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

0nRigl1tfu|lAppropriation,

We trust our state legislators, who return to session in
Harrisburg today, are well-rested after their month of
vacation and are prepared to vote Pitt andits fellow state-

“ related schools an adequate level of appropriation.

The manner in which Pitt was delivered to its present
position was unfortunate, though it is difficult to assign
blame correctly. We can understand the problems involved in
the management of Pennsylvania’s ﬁnances, and cannot
fault any lawmaker who wishes to see taxing and spending

held at sane levels.

But the way to fashion sane budgets is not through the
throughly insane abandonment of Pennsylvania’s state-

related universities.

To deny funding to Pitt, Penn State and Temple would be a
grave mistake; we believe most legislators know‘ this. What
we doubt, however, is that each representative understands

how grave the mistake would be.

The universities’ contribution to the state’s welfare does
not end with education and research. Pitt’s importance in
western Pennsylvania’s economy has been documented
several times. Penn State is, in many economic respects, the
best thing between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Each of the
three major state-related schoolsis one of the state’s largest

employers.

Each of the three also depends on its state funding, which
allows it to offer a decent education to its students and a
substantial amount of free service to Pennsylvania’s citizens.
.Pitt’s checks from Harrisburg have been coming, with
‘occassional interruptions, for a little more than a decade.

While the state’s financial embracement of the University
probably saved Pitt from sinking 10 years ago and has helped
its balance sheet since, Pitt’s relationship with the state has V
not been one-way. Pitt charges Pennsylvania residents one-

half the amount demanded of out-of-state students.

The’

university gives residents of impoverished local areas
everythingfrom medical services to basketball courts, usually

free of charge.

The House, Senate and Governor appoint

approximatly one-quarter of the membership of Pitt’s Board

of Trustees.

It is even reported that several national

championship rings earned by Pitt’s football team ended up

in Harrisburg.

There are countless facts from the tremendously important
to the ridiculously trivial—that demand Pitt receive its rightful
appropriation. But an easily countable and ridiculously small
number of legislators could’ cripple Pitt’s budget by not
approving non-preferred appropriations. This must not be
allowed to happen. Pitt’s money must be appointed without

delay.

It has been reported that William Rea, chairman of Pitt’s
Board of Trustees, favored closing the University rather than
borrowing funds necessaryto continued operation. We hope
‘this is not Rea’s belief, but if it is, we pray the legislature is

not so foolish as to entertain similar contemplations.

The

immediate pain at Pitt would be terrible, but the long-term
hurt imposed upon the state by Pitt’s closing would be

unbearable.

Struggle Reaches Crucial Point

In ‘may of 1970 thousands of
students across this country rose up
and shut down hundreds of colleges
across the United States to protest
Richard Nixon's invasion of Cam-
bodia. In response to this outrage,
students were gunned down by
police at Kent State, Jackson State,

Orangeburg and Southern Univer-

sity. The war had come home.

Since May 4, 1970, people have
been trying to obtain justice
through the courts for the murder of
four people and the wounding of
nine by the National Guard on the
Kent State campus.

This struggle to bring out the
truth about the murders took on a
new twist in November, 1976, when
the Board of Trustees announced
their plans to erect a new gym on the
site of the 1970 protest and
murders. The trustees perceived
that after seven -years the students
on our campus wouldhave forgotten
the Vietnam War, would have been
too young to remember or care
about Kent State, and more
generally would be too concerned
about “making it” than getting
involved in protesting something
they knew was morally wrong.

However, the trustees received a
rude awakening. Three hundred

Imagine a painting so bright and
beautiful you wished it was yours. If
it cost a week’s wages, you’d pay
that much to own it. The colors ﬂow
in a harmony that soothes your eye.
The picture is balanced, symmetri-
cal. Every item on the canvas
receives proper attention.

When you see the painting, you
smile. Sure, the art cost- you
something. But, price was nothing
compared to the pleasure it
provides. .

We admire many art works. Gar-
dens, atowering skyscraper, music, .
a book. Few people ever have the
chance to produce a masterpiece.
Even if they had the tools, most
probably doubt that their efforts
would be worthwhile. Heyl Keep
your eyes open! That opportunity is
coming for you.

Cafeteria Lighting Gaudy

A few days ago a survey was
being taken in the Towers cafeteria
questioning students’ opinions of
the new lighting there. I do not
know the results of the survey, but
since I was not present at the time I
would like to add one more opinion.

We shall ignore the fact that most
of the light comes straight down
from the ceiling (“down light”);
down light is the most uncomfor-
table to live and especially to work
by (Jean Rosenthal, “Nature of
Light”). It also often makes people
look strange, ugly, or, in extremes.
evil (Willard F. Bellmann, “Light-
ing the Stage”). Our question here
is what do we think of the new
lighting.

When we add color to light, it,

besunazing things. For instance.

a yellow light shining on a purple
surface will make that surface look
red. A green light on a red surface
will make that surface look black. If
we shine a red light and a green
light on the same surface, it will look
yellow. Were all of these
considerations made in the plan-
ning of the lighting?

The most important considera-
tion, however, is how to light food.
To make sure food looks appetizing,
the first rule is never to put green
light on food (Dick Knowles,
“Lighting the Food”). Just
yesterday I spotted some cottage
cheese in green light. In fact,
during the first meal, I took note. I
discovered that the last tables to be
occupied were those lit with green.
(There was one exception: a young

gentleman who purposely said,
“Ooh, I wanna sit at the green.”)
Many people have asked for
raspberry ice cream as vanilla
because it was under green light.
And, quite truthfully, my handsome
friend Rick looks ridiculous even
under the other selections of
orange, yellow, and blue.

Therefore, I submit that the
lighting in the Towers cafeteria is
gaudy, garish, and unaestetically
designed, and should be replaced
with the old PAR white down light,
with the indirect lighting from the
center of the room. But this is just
one opinion.

government is formed by many
small votes. This November, you
will have your turn to make your
mark on the reshaping of Pitts-
burgh.

A new mayor will be elected. Will
the colors on his canvas please your
Will the services from his
ofﬁce be in proper proportion—sat-

isfying your sense of equality and-

balance? Let’s take a look, Let’s
see what a mayor should be.
According to i'l5it'tsburgh’s char-
ter, the city‘ is to have a “strong
mayor” form of government. The
mayor has vast power to appoint
administrators and heads of city
offices and services. He can veto

‘ legislation concerning city laws. He

also can propose budgets to City
Council.

The mayor must see that “all
citizens, including minorities and
disadvantaged, (have) an equal
opportunity to obtain city con-
tracts.” Except for the police and
ﬁre departments, he has the power
“to appoint the chief officer of any
major administrative unit.” This
includes the Housing Authority and
Human Relations Commission
heads.

Understanding the many powers
of the Mayor, we see that the way he
uses his authority will affect our
lives for better or worse.

Let’s do our best to elect the
mayor who will fulﬁll our sense of
balance and quality. Let’s add our
own shadings of value. Together we
can try, we can help make
Pittsburgh a bright and beautiful

place to be. Make your mark. It
won’t cost much. Vote in

November. ‘

students, outraged at the actions of
the trustees, took over Rockwell

Hall on May 4 of this year to show‘

their opposition to the callous
treatment the trustees have shown
the people’s concerns about May 4.
Since then, throughout the sum-
mer, through hundreds of arrests,
through hours of police harassment,
in .spite of outrageous jail sentences
and lost jobs, thousands of people
have supported, sustained and
moved forward the struggle to move
the gym.

Our strength in blocking con-
struction until now has been in the
fact that large numbers of people
have participated- with us and our
strength in the future will lie in the
mass actions of our supporters.

We are now at a crucial point in
our struggle. We have run out of
courts and restraining orders. Con-
struction looms imminent. This is
the reason we are making a major
call for all people of conscience who
are concerned with the cover—up of
history at Kent State to come to the
rally at the Kent State Commons on
September 24 at noon. At Columbia
University, students, along with
thousands of supporters, halted
construction of a gymnasium by
seizing the site and occupying it
until their demands were met.
There is now a park where a gym
foundation once was begun at
Columbia.

0



The coalition firm’? V
believes that the mass actions ‘

people can stop the construction of
this tym before the foundation is
even begun. We feel it is crucial
that people show the trustees at
Kent how they feel about the
desecration of the Kent State
shooting site. We believe that a
large number of supporters can
back the trustees into moving the
gym. It can be moved.

We can learn from the lessons of
the 60’s——the people will never be
defeated!

and Rape,” says: “The typical
rapist might be the boy next door. ”
Rape is not a crime committed by
a stranger in a dark alley.
Twenty-four percent of rapes occur
in the victim’s home, 23 percent in
the attacker’s home and 10 percent
in the house of a friend. But an
estimated 90 percent of rapes go
unreported; of those reported, three
percent get convictions. Pittsburgh

Located at 211 Oaklane Avenue
PAAR offers a variety of services to
the Pitt and Pittsburgh community.
Programs include a 24-hour hotline
staffed with trained volunteers,
advocates to assist the victim in
dealing with the criminal and justice
systems and a “Rape Alert,”
published monthly.

“Rape Alert" contains descrip-
tions of rapists provided by victims
who have called the PAAR hotline.
The function of “Rape Alert” is to
help women avoid attack, identify
high-risk areas and heighten the
consciousness of the community
about the presence of rape.

Schroeder.

The afternoon’s protest was
-planned and sponsored by the May
4 Coalition. Car pools from Pitt and
;Carnegie-Mellon University were
arranged by the ,_R'__¢VolItionary
Student Brigade (RS3).

Upon arrival at the Kent State
campus, it was clear many diverse
political factions were represented
at the rally and that various types of
onlookers, agitators and supporters
came out for reasons of their own.

Next to blue-uniformed police
were the Yippies, dressed in black
T-shirts with red stars and green
marijuana leaves. Even more
readily identiﬁable than the Yippies
-and police were persons in T-shirts
with slogans. Many wore black red,
or white T-shirts (sold by the May4
Coalition, with proceeds going to a
common defense fund) saying
“Long live the Spirit of Kent and
Jackson State!” and “Remember
Kent State——Move the Gym.” A
handful of students wore yellow
shirts that read “Move the
Coalition! ” A few had on “Liberate
Marijuan_a” and “Outside Agi-
tator” shirts.

With the exception of the
numerous uniformed police and two
or three well-dressed evangelists,
the crowd’s attire was overwhelm-
ingly casual. The dressy exceptions
were the objects of jeers and scorn.

The afternoon agenda at Kent
State included speeches by leaders
of the different factions, live music
by Moonshadow and a long parade,
with stops along the way to
re-christen the buildings where the
four deceased students attended
most of their classes.

From center stage, a spokesman
for the Revoutionary Student
Brigade (RSB) explained the
situation:

The trip is part of the Center’s
certiﬁcate program in Latin Ameri-
can studies. To qualify for the
certiﬁcate, a student must take ﬁve
courses in Latin American studies
and participate in a trip. A related
concentration is offered to students
unable to take part in a trip.

Shirley Kregar cites various
students who, after a CIAS trip,
have gone on to do graduate work in
Latin American studies, work with
consulting ﬁrms on Spanish-speak-
ing projects or take jobs that have
some relation to Latin America. One
student is now a ﬁeld officer in La
Paz, Bolivia. Another is studying in
Colombia on a Rotary scholarship.

to aid the victim if she chooses to
prosecute.

“Rape or sexual assault has
occurred when any individual is
forced to submit to a sexual act or
violation of her/his body against
her/his will.” This is PAAR’s
deﬁnition of rape; its primary
concern is dealing with rape victims
and sensitizing potential victims.
But Pride stresses that imprisoning
a rapist does not deal with the basic
problem. The rapist rarely is helped.

The conditions that create him
remain the same or worsen while he
is in prison. When asked what
PAAR’s long term goal is, Pride
replied, “The elimination of sexism
in a society that creates rapes.”

PAAR, now located at the center
of the University, plans to involve
itself at Pitt. Lecturers from PAAR
will give two talks to Towers
residents next week. Chrisy Fowley,
victim services coordinator, will
begin a new set of volunteer training
sessions in October. In these
sessions, volunteers are trained to
deal with police, justice and medical
systems, and learn assertiveness,
creative listening and the political
implications of rape.

Doobie Brothers
Changing Their Style

By GREGORY G. REH

Doobie Brothers
Livin’ On The Fault Line
Warner Brothers

Under the saleient musical
guidance of Michael McDonald,
“Livin’ On The Fault Line” lets the
Doobie Brothers test their versatil-
ity in the uncomfortable and
unfamiliar territory of rhythm and
blues. -

,With the previous release of the
excellent “Takin’ It To The
Streets," which showcased the

V’ entry of McDonald’ as the band-’s
new musical force and leader, the

Doobies debutedtheir new musical-
forte. This was highlighted by the
band’s newly acquired interest in
easy funk and light rhythm and
blues. ‘

“Streets” was a band effort and
performance, with McDonald’s

throughout: “Fault Line” is
overpowered by McDonald’s self-
fulfilling his rhythm and blues
inclinations and concepts.

The end result of McDonald’s
creative monoply on “Fault Line”
is worn romantic cliches mixed with

funk-like novelties. Both of these
conquer the Doobies innate musical

feeling spirit.

“Echoes Of Love” and “Need A
Lady” are creative misconceptions
better forgetten. Both are grossly
weak and mesmerized attempts at
funk. McDonald’s “Nothin’ But A
Heartache” starts, off fresh, but
quickly dies in its tracks with a
banal disco thump and an over-run
chorus.

If the ‘Doobie Brothers had
generated their musical mutations
toward Patrik Simmons" jazz-rock
inclinations, they would have
produced a much more interesting
album.

Co-leader-guitarist Simmons’s
excellent‘ jazz-ﬂavored composi-
and the

tions in “Chinatown”
album’s title track save “Fault
Line” from a tragic fate. The

former‘ is a spellbound tribute to
the magic of the San Fransisco
community, climaxed by an ab-
sorbing beat and Simmon guitar-
vocal improvisations. 2

The latter, the albums best and‘
most exciting piece, is a breezy
number done in the Doobies
tradition. Simmons once again
creates quick and versatile im-
provisations, including a fantastic
vibes introduction by guest key-
boardist extraordinaire Victor
Feldman.

McDonald’s contribution to the
album is not entirely_negative. His
vocals are still some of the
strongest in rock today and his
compositional skills, which made
“Streets” such a unique and
progressive album, still manage to
shine through the unpleasantries
which cloud “Fault Line.’.’

I_t’s evident that McDonald is at

4 the best as a balladeer. But while
his “There’s A Light" and “You

Belong To Me," a Carly Simon
collaboration, are strong and
worthwhile supports to this claim,
it's doubtful any of the other band
members could handle this realm
of music without feeling uncom-
fortable.
(Continued on Page_l2/

“If this show had been born on
the networks, it never would have
survived,” Donahue claims.

“They would have said, ‘What do
you mean you have no band? You’re
spending an entire hour with
Proxmire?’ And there was no one to
laugh at my jokes,” Donahue
quipped.

“But it’s hard to succeed as a
non-network station,” he added.

Donahue stressed the importance
of balanced programming. “It
doesn’t do any good to talk if nobody
is listening. You have to be
attractive. I wouldn’t want
consumerism on every day. That
would be boring.”

4 A battle between Harrington and
O’Hair sparked heated questions
from the 3,500 audience members.

During the commercial breaks,
Donahue eased tension working the
crowd with the ease of a Vegas
entertainer. '

“Aren’t there any Catholics
here?” he chided the group .of
religious zealots.

Donahue gave a quick nod and a
half-smile of thanks to an insightful
audience questionner. It doesn’t
surprise him that women pose the
more interesting questions.

women will enter into a dialogue

Ballet Season Opens 

By BUENAD. SMITH

The Pittsburgh Ballet Theater’s
(PBT) Festival Season opened_
Friday evening at Heinz Hall with a
new production of “Romeo and
Juliet.” Choreographed by Cuban
I.orenzo Monreal, the new produc-
tion. had much more vigor and life
than traditional renditions.

“Romeo and Juliet’s “opening”
night featured the two principal
dancers, Jo Ann McCarthy and
Dennis Poole, in the title roles.

McCarthy has danced with PBT
since itsinception and has played
several title roles. Poole, joining
PBT this season as principal dancer,
has been acclaimed by critics
throughout the world as a “Virtuoso
dancer with phenomenal tech-
nique.” ‘

Poole’s talent was revealed in a
solo scene in Act II, where Romeo
ﬂees from the wrath of the Capulet
family after he slays J uliet’s cousin,
Tybalt. Poole’s perfect leaps and
speedy race around the stage
provided a ﬁtting sense of flight.

However, emotional impact was
not conveyed in the solos of either
Romeo or Juliet. In Romeo’s angry
fearful scene and Juliet’s miser-
able, frightened scene, the and-
ience felt none of the couple's
anguish: they witnessed only an
abundance of talent.

The flaw in communication
seemed to rest more heavily with
the choreography than the dancers’
performance. However, the
choreography cleverly conveyed the
sentiment of the ballet's last two
scenes.

After both Romeo and Juliet
committed suicide, another couple
replaced McCarthy and Poole in the_

Welcome to L.A.
Directed by Alan Rudolph
Forum Theatre

Los Angeles, the city of angels
and dreamers, provides the gloomy,
neurotic, and at times absurdly
funny backdrop for “Welcome to
L.A.,” Robert Altman’s latest
“slice of life” ﬁlm production.

In many ways, “Welcome to
is quite similar to Altman’s

$1975 smash “Nashville.” Although

Altman is just the producer this
time around, his former aide Alan
Rudolph wrote and directed the
ﬁlm, and Richard Baskin again
wrote all the music.

Like the city and its people
focused on in “Nashville,” Los
Angeles is a perfect setting for
examining the behavior of an
extremely interesting group of
human beings.

But unlike “Nashville,” where
the people in the country and
western capital of the world had
some hope of happiness at the film’ s
end, “Welcome to L.A.” is a
depressing ﬁlm. The characters

-t.}i:ffer from alienation throughout.

Since “Welcome to L.A.,” is a
“slice of life” film, the plot is loose
and rambling; the characters’ inter-
actions are the prime focus of
Randolph’s ﬁne direction.

The cast, on the whole, is
excellent, making for one of the
better acted films in recent
memory.

A disturbing ﬁlm, “Welcome to
LA.” is concerned with document-
ing the oddball behavior of a group
of people who happen to be thrown
together in and around the L.A.
recording industry.

All of the characters’ weaknesses,

alts and neuroses are explored in

depth; rich and varied camera work
captures a picture that isn’t pretty.

At the center of everything is the
young, blong, songwriter stud,
played with low-key cook by Keith
Carradine. He's brought to L.A.,
after three years in England, by his
Hollywood agent and sassy ex-lover
Vivcea Lindforms. He is to compose
songs for Richard Baskin, a
tempermental singer.

While in Los Angeles, Carradine
is exposed to other females (with
whom he forms promiscuous
relationships.) The realtor for his
temporary beach front apartment, a
nymphomaniac type played by Sally

Ktgnan, immediately falls for

like the agent, gets dumped.

Lauren Hutton plays a sensuous

Slié" also becomes
involved with the lustful Carradine,
and...you guessed it, gets the hook
when he becomes enamored with
the neurotic wife (Geraldine
Chaplin) of his father’s industrious
yet narrow-minded partner (Harvey
Keitel).

Chaplin is perhaps the saddest
character in this merry-go-round of
grief. Her abuse of cigarettes and
alcohol, combined with the prob-
lems of loving a man like Keitel,
who is obsessed with his career,
drive her to the brink of insanity.

In the opening scenes, Chaplin is
set up as a narrator who talks to
herself while traveling around the
city on one of her many all-day taxi
rides (a weird habit she adopts to
combat or stiﬂe her evergrowing
neurosis).

She also has an encounter with
Carradine but is the one prize he fails
to conquer.

Another veteran of previous
Altman ﬁlms, Sissy Spacek, turns in
an absolute gem of a performance as
the spaced-out and immoral day
maid who works for Sally Kellerman
and her oily husband (John
Considine), a second-hand fumi-
ture dealer. '

In a Christmas eve scene, Spacek
sexually teases Considine, but
hustles him for money before letting
the real fun begin.

If all this sounds pretty dismal,
don’t be mistaken; it is. If there is
any solace for the audience, it may
lie in the fact that we’d like to
believe our personal and business
lives are not as neurotic and
unhappy as those exhibited on
screen.

Yet, it is this unsavory possibility
that makes “Welcome to L.A.” so
effective. The ﬁlm strikes at the
core of this fear; that is why it hits so
hard on human terms. The
characters are believable and the
superb performances make them
even more convincing.

Altman and Rudolph have
succeeded in isolating the activities
of a handfulof human beings with
hang-ups, placing them under a
microscope, and suggesting that
this sort of thing happens every
where, not just L.A.

The ﬁlm’s settings also add to its
ilnpact. Instead of the sunny, bright

Tiran Porter’s sadly serious vocal

attempt on “Need A Lady” is an

excellent (bad?) example of
stretching boundaries of talent a bit
too far.

“Living’ On The Fault Line” is
obsessed with its extreme venture
into an alien format (rhythm and
blues). Previous fans will, quite
simply, be shocked by the band’s

splended display of the artist's

delicate sensitivity to the human

Marinaro also indulges in a
slightly askew perspective, with
interesting results. The model in

arm-wrestling pose) appears to be
swooping in a head-ﬁrst, easy glide

Morrill engages audience inter-

interception. Pitt capitalized on six
of those miscues for touchdowns.

Although Panther head coach

Jackie Sherrill could be accused of
running up the score against the
Owls, he said there wasn't much he
could do to keep the score at a

minimum.

“It was very tough to avoid
scoring the 76 points," ‘Sherrill
said. ‘ ‘In the ﬁrst half, we scored 48
points and only had to cross over the
50-yard line three times. When a
there’s

 game like that starts,
' nothing you can do about it.”

Sherrill took a 65-man squad and
used all but reserve quarterback

Wayne Adams in the contest.

“You can't tell the second-
stringers not to put out, because
they’re out there competing for a

starting job,” Sherrill explained.
Pitt was as close to being perfect
as Temple was to being imperfect.

The Panthers scored on their

first

seven possessions of the game;
their only noticeable mistake came
when Mark Schubert missed the

extra point after Pitt’s

touchdown.

The Panther defense was its

The offense responded to the
countless scoring opportunities
with a relentless attack. Quarter-
back Rick Trocano ran for three
touchdowns and threw for another;

Elliot Walker scored twice and

_added a six-point pass of his own.

The first team then gave way to the '

added four more touchdowns.

Jo Jo Heath set up the Panthers’
ﬁrst score when he took Temple’s
ﬁrst punt and returned it 58 yards to
the Owl 13-yard line. Walker ran
over right tackle three plays later
and Schubert added his ﬁrst of ﬁve
extra points, starting a scoring
barrage that wouldn’t quit.

Trocano, who is beginning _to
master the option play, notched the
next two scores with two successive
ﬁve-yard runs, and Pitt led by 21
points after the ﬁrst quarter.

The Panthers added three more
touchdowns before the second
period was half over, thanks largely
to Temple turnovers. Mock cheers
rose from the crowd of 13,199 when
Temple ball carriers simply mana-
ged to hold on to the football, but
after a point the Temple partisans
were too stymied to boo.

Walker began the second-quarter
scoring with a 14-yard option pass to
ﬂanker Willie Taylor, then broke up

After a 41-0 lead, Trocano threw a

Temple went into the locker room on
the wrong end of a 48-0 margin, its

worst half-time deﬁcit of all time. _

“At the half I needed 10 yards,”
Walker said, “so the coach put me
back into the game in the second
half to get it." I’m glad he did.”

“We decided to keep Elliot in the
‘game-—he wanted those 10 yards,
Sherrill said. “As soon as he got
them, we took him out. Our plan
was to get the ball to game-
breakers like Elliot and in the
second half, we tried to get it just to
Elliot."

One fact is interesting; Walker
achieved the task without expert
quarterback Matt Cavanaugh to
guide him.

“No doubt about ‘it—Matt’s the
big key to our offense,” Walker
said. “We could be number-one
with him. But I’ felt good about
Trocano-——I knew he could do the
job because his confidence got
better and better."

While Temple’s conﬁdence got
worse and worse, Anthony Ander-

didn't fare as well—only 24 yards

“Anderson is a good runner,”
Walker stressed. “You have to

what he had to run against.

“Today it was easy to beat
Temple. he continued. “The
Owls had a lot of mistakes. Those
fumbles really hurt you."

Walker wouldn't know—he had a

Bucknell Force Takes Pitt In vite  

By BOB LABRIOLA

It is a well-known fact that the
most efficier‘ ~ neutralize a
team that runes on ﬁnesse is
through the use of brute force.
This is exactly the tactic Bucknell

‘used to upset Pitt before capturing

the Pitt Invitational with a 20-7
victory over Slippery Rock.

While the Panthers’ Friday night
victory over Indiana matched
finesse with speed, the contest with
Bucknell was, much more physical,
with a total of 26 major infractions.
The Bisons jumped out to a 4-2 lead
in the ﬁrst period, but excellent
goal tending by Steve Feller and
two goals by George Machicote
brought Pitt to a 6-6 tie at the half.

In the second half, Bucknell’s
defensive tactics completely dis- -_
rupted the Panthers’ offensive
patterns and created numerous
fast-break opportunites for the
Bisons. As Pitt trailed 10-8 in the
fourth period, Butch Silva was
awarded a free throw in front of the
Bucknell goal. After the ball was
whistled in play. there was a
scramble in front, and the ball
ended up behind the Bison goalie.

Reaching for the stars seemed to be in practice as Pitt flanker Willie Taylor and

‘u.

a Temple Owl reach for a pass. The Panthers came out victorious, grasping

success while Temple tell to new laws.

The referee- disallowed the goal
ruling that the ball had not first
touched an opposing player,
although it appeared to the ofﬁcial
scorer that it had.

Pitt was never able to recover
and Bucknell, aided by Rick

Pitt s soccer team played a
tough Slippery Rock team to a 1-1 tie
Friday night. The tie gives the
Panthers a 1-2-1 record mark;
Slippery Rock has a 2-0-1 record.

Pitt scored first, about 17 minutes
into the first half, on an Irwin Siegel
goal an assisted by Bob Hughes.
The Rockets came back, 3%
minutes into the second half, on a
goal by Tom Venuti.

Pitt coach Leo Bemis said, “Both
teams had opportunities to score in
the second half. We had more in the
ﬁrst half; they only had about three
chances.” —

Pitt eutshet Slippery Rock, 28-15.
“We came on strong in the second
half and had some good opportuni-
ties to win the game. It was a good
game, looking at the movement and
goalie saves,” Bemis continued.

The Panthers will travel down the
road to Carnegie-Mellon tomorrow
for a confrontation with their
cross-campus rivals. Pitt will host
Temple Friday at 7 p.m. “Their
soccer team is very different than
their football team,” Bemis ex-
plained. “Temple team is very
ﬁrst in the nation last year up until
the playoffs. They are a very strong
club.”

Season openers generally are best
for those participating if they're
low-key. This held true for the
men’s cross country team, as it
started off its year with a third-place
showing at the Malone (Ohio)
Invitational last Saturday.

Coach Mike Agostinel1a’s Pan-
thers, competing against 19 other
teams, were led over the rolling,
muddy course by Dave McDonald,
who finished third. His time for five
miles was only 10 seconds off that of

’ Invitational winner Archie Mundy of

Rio Grande College.

McDonald’s teammates, Mel
Boyd (12th), Mark Studnicki (13th),
Tom Herrmann (23rd) and Gary
Siriano (30th) ﬁgured in Pitt’s
scoring.

"This was a very good meet to
start our season,” Agostinella
observed. ‘ ‘Everyone didn’t have to
run all-out haywire; we were
relaxed and, considering it was our
first meet, we’re fairly satisﬁed with
our performance.”

«

This Saturday could be a different
story. Penn State and West Virginia
University, both as skillful in cross
country as in football, will visit Pitt in
what Agostinella predicts will be
“one helluva cross country meet.”

The three squads will compete at
11 a.m. in Schenley Park.

Renner's three fourth-period goals,
held on for a 13-10 upset. thus
ending Pitt’s 18-match winning
streak against conference oppon-
ents. Bison coach Dick Russell
credited the win to “great overall
team defense.”

'l'he Panthers opened the tourn-
ament with a convincing 17-4
victory over Penn State, as Dave
Diaz and George Machicote scored.
ﬁve goals a piece to lead Pitt’s
offensive onslaught.

 

In the Indiana match. Pitt
dominated play throughout the first
half. Machicote scored seven goals
as the Papthers built a 10-5
half-time lead. but Indiana's speed
forced Pitt into foul trouble in the
second half. Luis Toro and Butch
Silva fouled out as the Hoosiers
fought back to trail by a goal.
14-13, with less than one minute
remaining. Pitt rose to the
occasion and Machicote scored his
11th goal ofthe match with :29 left,
setting the stage for the match with
Bucknell.

in the consolation match. Pitt
chose to forfeit rather than
relinquish its right to have one of
the scheduled referees replace;
Army won by the score of 1-0.

Coach Miguel Rivera explained
the decision. “After that match
with Bucknell. ldidn’t want to send
my players into the water when the
officials were not calling the fouls.
I talked it over with the team first
and then decided that for the sake of
tranquility and unity on the team,
we would forfeit if we had to.

“You never like to lose. but since
this was a tournament and had no

effect on our conference record.‘ we .

felt that the principle of the matter
was far more important." Rivera
added. “Next week we have a
match with Bucknell; there will be
quality referees doing the match
and the outcome will be different."

Hebert Faces Pressure

ByJOHNFINN

Pitt News Staff Writer

There is a type" of pressure,
unique to the coaching profession,
that gnaws at stomachs and grays
hair—the pressure of leading one’s
team to the top.

Second_-year women’s volleyball
coach Mike Hebert, who guided Pitt
to an outstanding campaign last
year, including a fourth-place finish
at the Eastern Regionals, faces such
pressure this season.

Not only are most of Hebert’s
starters returning, but two excellent
recruits have decided to attend Pitt
as well. This has inﬂuenced many of
the experts to put their money on the
Pantherettes to capture the Eastern
Championship this year.

- “There is no doubt that we have
some of the finest individual talent in
the country,” Hebert admitted,
“but the pieces haven’t fallen into
place just yet.” . 1

Among the. returnees from last
year’s squad are_ sophomores Cindy
Chambers and Andy Pletz.
Chambers, last year’s Most Val-
uable Player, proved to be a strong
blocker and a powerful hitter. Pletz
has been playing volleyball since
she was quite young, and also is a
powerful spiker.

Pitt’s two top recruits, Maria
Perez and Ingrid Mueller, have
played well enough to earn
themselves spots in the starting
rotation.

Perez, a member of the USA East
National team, will be one of the
setters, while Mueller, a 5-11 spiker
from Cheektowaga, New York, will
be one of the starting hitters.

The other two unfilled positions
are wide open, and the competition
is ﬁerce.

.—

Mary Savage and Mary Lou

Susang, who played opposite each

other last year, now are competing
for the second setting position.
“Right now, ’ ’ said Hebert, “the two
girls are dead even.” 3

Meanwhile, ﬁve women are
competing for the coveted ﬁnal
spot. Seniors Sue Hershelman and
Diane Zaken are competing with
junior Pat Montgomery, sophomore
Kathy Sonnricker and freshman
Nancy Zentener.

“We have the talent,” Hebert
said, “but we haven’t begun to play
as a team. 1 think when the girls
realize their potential, we will have
a very good season.”

The Pantherettes open the 1977
campaign with a quadrangular

match against Clarion, Duquew,

and West Virginia Tuesday at‘ 6
p.m. at Trees Gym. While Pitt’s
three foes are competitive, they also
are weak.

Next weekend (September 30-
October 1), however, the Panther-
ettes will host the inaugural Pitt
Invitational.

The tournament will provide fans
with an opportunity to see women’s
volleyball at its best as well as give
Pitt its ﬁrst taste of top-caliber
competition. The 16-team touma-
ment includes the top eight ﬁnishers
from the 1976 Eastern Regional
tournament.

If the Pantherettes pass this first

test, 1977 could become the of‘ ,

the Pantherette.

PITT DIGS: New assistant coach
Bob Shaeffer, who came to Pitt from
Penn State, has been quite popular
with the team in the short time he has
been here. Last year’s assistant

coach; Rich Schall, stepped down‘

because of the difficulty of
commuting each day from his home
in Derry...only Sue Hershelman and
Diane Zaken remain from Pitt’s
original squad.

“When two teams are equal, it
always comes down to the kicking
game,” said Texas A&M Coach
Emory Bellard, “and that’s what
happened here.” _

“Here” was Lubbock, Tex.,
where Tony Franklin, the barefoot
kicker, booted ﬁeld goals of 48, 25,
51 and 37 yards in pacing the
sixth-ranked Texas Aggies to a key
33-17 Southwest Conference
triumph over No. 7 Texas Tech.

,, “Here” also applied to Colum-

‘’ bus. Ohiu, where Berlin-born Uwe

von Schamann kicked ﬁeld goals of
23 yards in the first period, 33 yards
in the second quarter and a
dramatic 41-yarder with only three
seconds remaining, lifting third-
ranked Oklahoma to a 29-28 victory
over No. 4 Ohio State.

The kicking game also made the
difference in Jackson, Miss., where

Berj Yepremian’s 37-yard ﬁeld goal '

in the third period helped No. 13
Florida turn back No. 12 Mississippi
State, 24-22. And in Lawrence,
Kan., Kansas upset No. 15
Washington State, 14-12, when the
losers’ Paul Watson, who booted
ﬁeld goals of 31,24, 25 and 33

*»;~*ya'r"ds, missed a 32-yarder on the

game’s final play.

The kicking game, however, did
not have much effect in such places
as Los Angeles, where second-
ranked Southern California swamp-
ed Texas Christian,_ 51-0; Logan,
Utah, where No. 20 Brigham Young
manhandled Utah State, 65-6;
