Ion Matthews Concert

BY RICH HARRY

Despite the cancellation of the
Nov. 7 Homecoming concert, an
alternative concert featuring Ian
Matthews will be held the same
evening. '

Matthews, originally scheduled
as a back-up. act for a concert
featuring the New Riders of the
Purple Sage, will appear free of
charge.

Last week, the Office of Student
Activities canceled the production
of a Homecoming show following
the New» Riders’ refusal to appear
at Pitt on Nov. 7. Student
Activities canceled the concert,

. chieﬂy because of the short time

left in which to produce a major
show. _

Last night, Pitt Programming
conﬁrmed plans to produce the
Matthews concert and tentatively
set the concert for David Lawrence
Hall.

Wednesday, Pitt Programming
requested the SGB allocate 8,650 to
produce Ian Matthews and another
act at the Syria Mosque.’

SGB voted Wednesday night-4-3 .

to refuse the funds required for a
Syria Mosque show. Instead, the
board voted to ‘support an
Allocations Committee recommen-
dation for a $3,500 i funding
. adjustment to hold the Ian

Matthews concert in the Student
Union Lower Lounge.

The Allocations Committee rec-
ommended Pitt Programming re-
ceive funds for a Lower Lounge
concert instead of a Syria Mosque
show because the time was too
limited to get another act to play
with Ian Matthews, Allocations
member Carol Thomas said.

Programming Committee mem-
bers told the Board Wednesday
they would refuse to produce the

Ian Matthews show if they were .

forced to use the Lower Lounge.
Even if they cancel Ian Matthews,
programming would be forced to
pay his $2,500 fee.

Programming Co-Chairman Bill
Lurye said the Committee was
against producing the show in the
Lower Lounge because it would
require too much work for the
committee. ‘

“We’ll have to buy and set up a
stage ourselves if we put the show
on in the Lounge, which wouldn’t
have to do if it was held at the
Mosque," Lurye said.

Last night, when Pitt Programm-
ing Co-Chairmen Andy Coleman
and Tim Stoops conﬁrmed the
Committee would produce a
concert for Homecoming weekend,
they said Programming will look for
another act to open for Ian
Matthews. V '

Jonas Salk, who perfected the

ﬁrst polio vaccine while at Pitt, said
production of an inﬂuenza vaccine
with potency against all influenza
strains is feasible, and he urged
countries to use the dead instead of
live virus polio vaccine.

An all-encompassing vaccination
must be found because of the speed
with which influenza strains
appear, Salk said at a lecture in
Scaife Hall Wednesday.

Salk showed graphs displaying
the cyclic .activity of different
inﬂuenza strains over the past
century that indicate inﬂuenza
peaks at regular intervals.
Although these diseases do not
occur at the same time, Salk said
vaccines that immunize against all
strains at the same time should be
introduced.

“The cyclic recurrence of in-
ﬂuenza suggests a vaccine with all
antigen components which the body
may not supply at all ages, and
sufﬁcient levels must be devised,”

Salk said. Antigens are substances 5

that can be introduced into the
blood to produce antibodies for
combatting disease.

Salk supported the killed .virus
over the live virus polio vaccine.
“The introduction of the ‘live
vaccine to the United States in 1961
produced no change in the rate of
eradication of polio.

“In countries where the killed.
polio virus alone has been used, the
disease has been obliterated,” Salk
said. “The virus live has been
known to cause disease.”

“As long ago as 1945 we found 4

out viruses don’t have to be alive to
immunize,” Salk said.

“We have reached the point in
time where we can anticipate the
eradication of certain diseases,”
Salk said.

America

Will Write Off Czech

BY MREA CSORBA

Czechoslovakia is a westward
leaning nation within the Eastern
European bloc which shouldn’t be
written off by America, Pitt
Graduate School Professor Michael
Flack said Wednesday in a report
of his recent visit to that country.

“America shouldn’t relegate
Czechoslovakia to the back ranks of,
the Eastern European communist
bloc but consider it in the wider
Western European context,” Flack
said ina talk sponsored by the
Russian and Eastern European
Studie§ Program. V '

The professor of international
and intercultural affairs, who was
in Czechoslovakia during the 1968
Russian invasion, found eight years
later “a serious dedication by the
government to make Czechoslov-
akia a modern model European
communism.” Flack said under-
neath, life continues much like it
had before the take-over.

Democratic presidential nominee
Jimmy Carter stuck closely to his
campaign themes of lower unem-
ployment and inflation rates when
he spoke in Pittsburgh Wednesday
night, but he added ._an issue to his
speeches--the difference between
his running mate Walter F.
Mondale and Robert Dole,«Pres-
idem l“or'd's choice for the second

slot. — ’ .

Larter told 1,400 local Democrats
.~in the William Penn Hotel-ballroom
that when he selected a vice
presidential running mate, “l had

one criterion in my mind-.-who“ ‘

would be the best president if I

should not serve out my term. 1 am .

proud of my choice of Walter
Mondale. "

lhe candidate, on his fourth visit ‘

to the Steel City since the campaign
began, reminded guests at the
S30-a-plate fund raiser‘ of Ford’s
choice of Dole, who has: caused
controversy by blaming Demo-
crats for World War.ill:,"_a_‘t’i'd the
lxorean War, andthat theyiiii/j.t‘3'tild be
‘voting for a two-man ticket ‘on
election day. "

"It's going to be close," Carter .

told the crowd, which included ‘such
local notables as Governor Milton

Haherty and most area Democratic
candidates.' ‘ ‘I've never looked for a

don "t fear a close election and
neither do you."

Larter was interrupted», by
applause several -times,-, bringing
the loudest sign ‘ofapproval when

he mentioned former ‘president '

that said "lhe buck stops here."

Belore taking
William Penn, Carter met briefly
with representatives from Irish-
American organizations in the
Hilton Hotel, assuring them of his
concern over domestic troubles in
lrcland. 1

He also made an appearance on a
local television news program
where he was asked if he had a spot

Flack said daily life has improved
since his last visit, with industry
intensiﬁed, and that the cities are
well supplied with material goods.
“A homeostasis has been achiev-
ed,” Flack said. “People have
money and there is full employ-
ment. Acting within the realm of

prudence, the Czechs live without"

fear”

“It is mainly the intellectuals
that are turned off to the Russia
doctrine," Flack said. 5

News "media and television are
the main instruments of doctrina-
tion by the regime, Flack reported.
“Centrally located places also have
’.screamers,’ ”

resound with slogans like “Let’~s
learn from Soviet women,’_’ and

“Today’s work, Tomorrow’s happ- ;
iness”). Large poster photographsw 
of distinquished people are dis- 
played throughout the citi_e§_, as 
c_"mA1t.1-i-_,

models of exemplary party
bution.

Flack said development of 1 'the_¥
arts, is encouraged by the state,‘
which gives rise to much inventive-. ‘

A ness in Czech music, theatre and .
painting. Education, also is taken i

very seriously by the state.

“The first day of the school year .
is a holiday, with bands playingﬂto ~ \

welcome back the students,” Flack
said. Books are inexpensively
published, but beautiful’ though
often propagandic in subject

No Pantsuits, Judge Orders

PITTSBURGH (AP) - A Criminal
Court judge here has refused to
hear a case because the female
prosecutor wore a pantsuit into his
courtroom. The action by Judge
Nicholas Papadakos came Wed-
nesday after assistant Dist. Atty.
Jo Ann D’Arrigo showed up in a
gray pantsuit.

The judge believes slacks worn
by female courtroom personnel
detract from the decorum, his
secretary said.

The case involving a Dormont
youth charged with burglary
eventually was heard by another
judge.

Putting Aside The Egos

editorial

Many times, when a crisis occurs, those involved will rise to the
'  occasion, put aside personal differences and solve the problem. This is
what happened with this year’s Homecoming concert.

It s not the Homecoming concert anymore. That was eliminated in a
display of power by the Ofﬁce of Student Activities. Instead, a
noii-Honiecominp concert is being held during Horriecoming weekend.

As late as yesteraa’, there was no concert at all. Student Government
board, Allocations Committee and Programming Committee were
squabbling over the whole deal. It seems that Prograrmning wanted the
concert, headlined by Ian Matthews, held in the Syria Mosque.

Student Gcverrmient didn’t want the concert there. They wanted it to
be held in either the Student Union Lower Lounge or David Lawrence
Hall.

Without Student Govemment support, the Allocations Committee
would probably not approve the budget modification necessary for the
concert to be held in the Mosque. ‘

but ‘there was a deeper conﬂict. Programming Committee has
operated very independently of Student Government over the past few
years.

Programming felt that Student Govemment now wanted to interfere
with what autonomy it had. The Committee wanted to call the shots.
when Ian Matthews couldn’t work in the Lower Lounge, the choice came
down to David Lawrence Hall or no concert at all. Programming was
willing to opt for no concert.

Prograniiiiing and_Student Government were playing games 
each other. Like their superiors in Student-Activities who helped create

the whole mess, each was trying to prove how much power it had. It was
'a game where the real losers would be the student body.

I he question of how much power should be given to the Programming .
Conmiitte must be resolved. But not at the expense of the students and
uicir Homecoming concert.‘ T

W men is why, upon afew hours reﬂection, Programming changed it’s

‘lllllld. lt agreed to the concert in David Lawrence Hall, free to the
students. It is a decision Programming is to be commended for. The
Coninuttee put the students ahead of its pride.

. it is time for Allocations and Student Government to do the 

:-they also should put aside their pride and expedite the paperwork so the

Vcollccfl. can go on. Homecoming is but one week away.

Even More Fun Than Sex

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Tests are part and parcel of the
University routine. They are also a
cause of great suffering among the.
student population. What isn’t

well known is the effect testing .

season has on the faculty.

Most will approach the task with
equanimity, fairness and good-fel-
lowship. After all, how else can
they tell if kids are paying
attention? A

There are, of course, antedilu-
vian vestiges of another age of
testing. The number is uncertain,
but students can be assured that
the prospect. of a _midter_m_ is
guaranteed tofuncover the darker
side of many faculty.

One such individual is a certain
professor Jennikins, who some-
times displays so very many dark
sides he appears in danger of

‘ bursting clean out of the three-di-

mensional plane.

You also probably found that
there were so many activities and’
facilities at your disposal, you
didn’t know what to do with
yourself. Trees Hall and the
Student Union" may have been

any University-sponsored events

going on- that evening...but you

Perched like a bird of prey on his
favorite stool in a badly lit and
roach infested establishment on the
edges of campus, Jennikins could
hardly -contain his glee at the
thought of testing time.

“I haven’t felt this good in
days,” J ennikins said, wiping away

. a tear of pure, distilled joy. The
bartender raised an eyebrow, and '

then went on with adding water to a
bottle of vodka.

“It's testing time,” -Jennikins
said. “You might not understand,
but for some faculty it is the only
salvation on this earth.”

Pitt Band Has Military Air

BY BETH KRAMER

It’s a brisk Saturday morning in
October and the Pitt Stadium
stands are ﬁlled with fans, alumni,
administration and students.
Down in the hole of the stadium,
the band waits. Instruments clang
together, a hat falls, some music
drops. Tense faces, wide-eyed
freshmen stare around, hands
clutching instruments. Anticipa-
tion. Suddenly, a sharp shrill, the
whistles blow. The University of
Pittsburgh Marching Band struts
onto the field.

Except at half-time, Pitt’s Band
is a relatively unnoticed student
organization on campus. Including
the 149 players, eight managers
and 13 majorettes, 170 people form
the band. The band members have
a broad range of majors and
interests—none are music majors.

But their differences are forgotton '

Monday, Tuesday and Thursday
from 6:15-8:15 p.m. and Saturday
football games.

Band Director Don Haller sees
the band as having a very “healthy
relationship” with the football
team. “Theband gets caught up in
all the enthusiasm for the team.”
Haller is a conﬁrmed ‘sports fan’
and enjoys it as much as the band
when Tony Dorsett comes in to
thank them all for their support or
when Johnny Majors mentions the-
band on his Sunday morning show.

“This is the ﬁrst job I’ve ever

had that I could do 24 hours a day. 7

I really get excited at the football
games and the basketball games
and wrestling matches we play
sometimes.’ ’

But while the band has pride in
Pitt's teams, it also has a
dedication to the perfection of the
band itself, according to Haller.

The members give up six hours a
week and all day Saturday.
Members of the band know’ what
needs to be done, Haller says, if
they are to be good. Each person is
responsible for learning his music
and ﬁeld routine, he says.

Mary Lintz, president of the
band sorority and a cymbal player,
remembered her freshman year in
band.

“The instruments are heavy and
it gets awful cold but we kept on
marching. If someone yelled at us,
we were wrong. One person out of
line could mess everything up. At
ﬁrst, I couldn’t get used to the
screaming but then you realize that
everyone just wants the band to be
the best it can be. And so you want
it to be the best, too.”

Haller thinks this is “the best
band” since he came ﬁve years
ago. “We are very successful this
year and have the potential to be a
really great band.”'

Two years ago the band made a
lot of changes in their image and in
their style, according to Haller.
New uniforms, new music and new
arrangements have up-dated the
band’s image, making it more
professional. The music is now a
combination of the traditional and
the modern.

“It is difﬁcult to put together a-

show that pleases everyone,” says
Haller. “We have three different

age groups coming to our games
and we can't Please them all. A
couple of weeks ago we did a ‘Disco
Show’ which was obviously aimed
at the students. Homecoming is
more of the traditional band show
for all the people who come back to

-see us. And every year we try to do '

a show just for us."

Putting together a show ‘takes a 
lot of hard work and patience. A 
band practice on the ﬁeld reminds ’

many of the Army. The uniforms
are warm clothes and hats white for
freshmen, yellow for sophomores,
blue for juniors and green for
seniors. The lines must be straight
There is no talking in the squads.
They are there to march and that’s
what they do. Again and again the
same routine is done until it
satisﬁes the director. The air is
crisp and the sounds echoes off the
stadium walls‘. “All' right,
remember what you're doing.
Let’s do it again and let’s play this
time trumpets.” The squad break
with a “HO!” and scramble back
into position. With military
precision, stepping just right, the

band coordinates the music and

their feet. It moves like a
caterpillar across the ﬁeld and, if
one person missteps the symmetry
is broken. “O.K., take it from
Dan.”

Dan Stifﬂer, the Drum major
prances onto the ﬁeld, everyone
turns together, one fellow in the
back row has a stiff leg but he’s still
marching, dragging it across the
ﬁeld. A trombone burst cuts the air
and the drums follow. The sound
grows, peaks, grows louder and
then the song is over and all kneel
on the ground.
they scream.

Fellowships Up For Grabs

BY BETSY NORMAN

One of the more recent programs
designed to revitalize Pitt’s curri-
culum is the Undergraduate
Teaching Fellowships, according to
Robert Marshall, Dean of the
College. of Arts and Sciences
(CAS).

“The fellowships are designed to
get the student’s perspective into
courses," Marshall said. “We
don’t want this to be something
graduate teaching assistants do.”

The fellowships, which are worth
$500‘ each, are awarded to 12 CAS
students each term. Awards are
based on joint
proposals, which explain how the
teaching fellow will function in the
course. '

“Applications have been low in
the past,” Marshall said. “In the
winter term of 1976, less than 12
awards were granted due to the
fact that worthy proposals were
scarce._

“The major problem with the
proposals,” according to Marshall,
“is that they tend to be vague. You
have to be rather speciﬁc as to how
you will change the course, and
specify what new things will be
implemented,” Marshall said.

The deadline for student propo-
sals is Nov. They must be sent to
Marshall in 917 Cathedral.
Announcements of the awards will
be on Nov. 12, according to
Marshall.

Since the”fellowships- were

instituted five years ago, there ‘

have been a, wide variety of

faculty-student '

theater course. A student who had
experience in children's theatre
helped the professor with the
design and composition of the
course, in addition to the dramatic
presentations throughout the term.
Another interesting proposal
concerned’ a Latin American
course. One student had done
extensive traveling in Latin Ameri-
ca and hoped to relate his personal
experiences in the course.
“The thing I really want to stress
is that you never know what people

will come up with in their
proposals,” Marshall said. “I’ve
gone through the process of
evaluating proposals seven or eight
times and each new batch turns up
several new ideas.

“Everyone involved in this pro-
gram seems to have a very
educational and rewarding experi-
ence, and it also is ﬁnancially
rewarding,” Marshall said. “But
there just aren’t enough applica-
tions.”

“HAIL PITT!”

' der was great.

BY PETE BUTCH

C. J. Bamey’s, on Forbes
Avenue, serves good food but has a
tacky atmosphere and high prices.
Taking a quick look around the place

while the hostess seated us, the
interior design reminded me of
Early American Flea Market. All
sorts of “farmy” things one would
pick up at such an event hung from
the wall.

The _menu featured omelets and
“gourmetburgers’ ’, hamburgers
with a variety of unusual condi-
ments. They were overpriced. I
was charged $10 for two hambur-
gers, two bowls of soup and two
bottles of beer. Not exactly a wise
place to frequent for lunch.

But the food is good. The
home-made Manhattan clam chow-

It was spicy, not
bland like canned soup. And the
French onion soup was the way
ﬁnicky chefs like it: boiling, with a

crouton and mozarella

? melted on top.

The hamburgerscwere unique. I
had one with ham and blue cheese
melted on top. Ham and muenster
cheese topped my companion’s

stamped out by machine. And they

that doesn’t get soggy when you
take them out of the freezer and
throw them in the deep-fryer.” '

breathing down our necks. Despite
‘the crowd, we were not ignored, and
1 she made no mistakes.

If it was anything other than
hamburgers, I would not have
cringed at the check. It was better
than two all beef patties, special
sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles,
.onions on a sesame seed bun. But
in the end, hamburgers are

hamburgers, even ones that thing if I

they are being served at the
Oakland Hilton. 9 ’

Whoever set the beer prices must;

really thing the place is the Oakland

Hilton. A bottle of Michelob costs ~ 
one dollar, a steep price for a if 1'

domestic beer. Maybe they don’t

want people to drink and loiter.
We also had to listen to music

from the radio station WDVE, piped

through the place and although it’s 7

music I enjoy, it did not enhance the
atmosphere.

It was an enjoyable place to eat,
but l’ll be eating my hamburgers at
Mac’s until I get my budget back
into shape. . 1

Editor’s note: Pete Butch has‘
studied cooking for two years under
three certiﬁed chefs. ’

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

Stephen Stills is a legendary
American music personality who
has been receiving a lot of critical
ﬂack lately. His last three solo
albums, Stills, Stephen Stills Live,
and Illegal Stills, have bombed
commercially and received little of
the critical analysis due them.
Everyone seems ready to write
Stephen Stills off as a no longer
vibrant contemporary musical art-
ist.

But, oh, if his accusers could have
witnessed Stills, by himself, in the
concert Tuesday night. He was
truly dynamic and totally honest.
Appearing at the Syria Mosque, he
totally captivated the crowd with his
hoarse masculine voice, deft guitar,
piano playing and, above all, his
songs.

Stephen Stills over the last 10
years has written some truly
powerful music. Whether it be in
the 60s supergroup Crosby, Stills,
Nash and Young, Manassas or on
his own, Stills is one of the greatest
musical talents America has
produced to date. On Tuesday
night, he covered all bases from his
long and productive career.

He walked on stage without
introduction, gimmicks or props,
and let his music speak for itself.
Opening his acoustic guitar set with
“Change Partners,” from his

 

second solo album, Stille came
across—in walnut sunglasses,
striped brown sweater, and faded
jeans—as a friendly big brother who
was weathered it all and is still there

to offer us entertainment and hope _

for the future.

“Helplessly Hoping,” a tune
from his stormy Crosby, Stills, Nash
and Young days, was his second
selection, evoking memories of
what it was like to be alive in the
Woodstock era.

Nillson’s “Everybody’s Talking
to Me,” seemed a heartfelt
personal statement by Stills. He
has held up through the critical
onslaught of late and song justifies
his simple defense. He is a
musician, not a super poet
laureate—nothing more and noth-
ing less.

‘ ‘Make Love To You” is one of the
better songs off the current
Stills-Young album, and Stills
delivered it with mellow joy. He
ended his acoustic guitar set with
“Crossroads,” an old blues stan-
dard done by everyone and their
mother, but coming from the

_ seasoned Stills, it was an apt and

effective concert selection.
Hecklers are common at all

Pittsburgh concerts, and Stills had

to put up with his share. People in

the crowd kept yelling for an

appearance by Neil Young through-
out the show, and Stills knew it. He

A Fun Night Of Y
Culture At Forum

BY TOBI ROSEN

Every myth clouding Carnegie
Institute’s International Poetry
Forum exploded last Wednesday
night. The audience had a good
time.

Even the high schoolers whose
well-meaning English teachers
dragged them in to get “cultured”
weren’t disappointed.

But when his topics migrated to
the American Southwest, his voice
was still dragging through the
marshes. Like Wright, he is deeply
moved by his subjects, but
Tomlinon’s voice bellows their
affection.

Poet Peter Porter served up more
than intellectual illiterations. His
scholarly verse ﬁlled the evening

with obscure literary and British

 

Porter, Charles Toimlinson and.Kit

W right, who gave a refreshingly humorous performance at Wednesday

night Poetry Forum.

Three diverse British poets
complemented each other in both
style and literary quality. a

The highlight of most people’s
evening came in a long, lean
package——Kit Wright who resem-

 bles dancer Tommy Tune without

his tap shoes. He had us
snickerin g about displaced doll
house animals and bungling

bureaucratic messes and scored‘

points with meaningful
contact with his audience.

Charles Tomlinson, my favorite,

allusions. In an ode to Shake-
speare, Porter, made a passing
reference to English director Peter
Brook, famous for his revolutionary
staging of A Midsummer Night’s
Dream. The thrill of playing
Porter’s intellectual name-game
and winning made my evening
complete.-»

The poetry reading lasted for a
solid hour and a half and didn't‘ let
up. Poems came in rapid sucession
making it impossible to absorb
such voluminous amounts of
material. But whichever few
poems you do walk away remem-
bering were your personal pinna-

ignored their requests for a while,
but finally broke down and
responded, “You keep on hollerin"
for Neil. Well I’m here and he’s not,
so I'll just have to carry on by
myself.” He received a tumultuous
ovation with this reply.

“Circlin’ ” and “Buyin’ Time,”
off Illegal Stills, were two of the
most warmly received numbers
from his piano set. » The real
crowd pleaser was a melody of “49
Bye-Byes” and “For What it’s
Worth” and, in it, Stills let it be
known who his presidential choice
is: Governor Jimmy Carter.

Some people were disappointed
that Still’s shunned electric music,
playing only the encore tunes,
Gregg Allman’s “Midnight Rider”
and “Find the Cost of Freedom,”
but there is a valid reason. Stills has
had problems with his hearing
recently, and the blaring sound of
electric music could only cause
further damage.

.Stephen Stills isn’t washed up.
He entertained me,.and on his next
trip to Pittsburgh, with or without
accompaniment, I will be in
attendance to witness his musical
prowess.

Opening for Stills was Phil Cody,

Sculptures Imitate
Human Form--CoIdIy ‘

BY D. SHAPIRO

Sculpture by Thomas Brunger, a
former Pitt studio arts assistant
professor is now on display at the
,museum of art_ Sarah Scaife
Gallery. The six pieces that
comprise the show are all made of
sanded aluminum. To vary the
surface of the different pieces,
Brunger ran the sander over the
metal in certain patterns. The
silvery finish created, which
reﬂects the light in a changing
manner as you walk around the
piece, is about the most interesting
thing in Brunger’s sculpture.

The shapes of the sculptures are
mainly horizontal and vertical.
Angles predominate; only one
piece--“Voyage”--has any curves
at all. The form of the sculptures is
reminisent of objects we see
everyday, which also are composed
of right angles. Tables, railings
and lamp posts are the things
which come to mind.

The sculptures are mostly
low-sitting with only two of them,
“Untitled” and “Bridge”, being
taller than the average person.

(Continued from Page 10)
“Untitled" is the only piece in the
show that invites the viewer to
participate actively. This piece is
basically tripod in structure. It has
three legs and, from one of them a
tall vertical of aluminum rises,
which ends in two twisted arms.
The viewer feels drawn to stand
under this sculpture. You feel safe
there; it's like leaning up against a
lamp post. .

Brunger also seems to be
experimenting with the limits of
balance and support for his pieces.
In one of the sculptures, “Bridge”,
the main supporting elements are
tilted. They look like they may fall
at any moment. I

Another piece, entitled “Fall,”
consists .of a series of connected
metal plates, which stand delicate-
ly on their corners. This piece is
the most lyrical in the show. The
aluminum plates are arranged in
such a way that there is a sweeping

‘movement, a cascade of the metal

pieces, like a slow-motion fall of
large leaves.
Brunger uses elements with .a

‘different texture from the sanded

aluminum in only two of the pieces.

In “Locked Gate,” a piece of
corrugated metal ﬂooring is added.

In “Voyage,” a wavy tape of
aluminum runs from one end of the
piece to the other. These unusual
elements, although they have a

different quality, are still metal,

the same material as the rest of the
pieces of which they are a part.

the school of hard knocks. The best
way to describe Cody would be to
call him a bespectled and respect-
able Tom Waits.

Cody, like Stills, went it the solo
route, and his piano playing and
moving songs went over just great,
in light of the fact that he is
relatively unknown. He sang of his
life “New York City Blues,” movie
fantasy “Bogie” and did the song
made famous by his writing buddy
Neil Sedaka, “Laughter in the
Rain.” Cody was good-naturedly
low key and humbly entertaining.

But Majors will hesitate upon
seeing a black cat, or an
Orangeman, a Cadet, a Mountain-
eer or a Nittany Lion for that matter,
all capable of throwing a rotten
apple into Pitt’s bushel of illustrious
1976 accomplishments.

As always, Majors is stressing his
“one at a time” theory, with
Syracuse the “one” tomorrow at
Pitt Stadium (1 :30 p.m. kickoff). For
weeks the Panther mentor has put
down bowl _stories and has
emphasized the need to take care of
the, “business at hand” before
embarking on something in the
future.

So, even though the Syracuse
Orangemen bring a 3-4 record to
Pittsburgh and have scored an
average of only 12.7 points per
game, or about what Pitt has given
up, Majors is concerned, remem-
bering well, as he will throughout
the rest of the season, the old axiom
that one team can beat another team
on any given day.

‘ ‘Syracuse played an outstanding
game against Maryland,” Majors
said. “They really went after
Maryland and they (the Terrapins)

are ranked number ﬁve in the

country. This shows that most
football teams will rise to a high
peak when they are playing a

men’s third consecutive loss of the _

Nigh-A No vel Performer

BY JIM LEWIS

A new best seller is out on the
shelves, a novel which has already
sold a million copies in Pitt soccer
coach Leo Bemis’ book.

It all begins in the friendly little
town of Bethlehem, Pa. where Mark
Nigh; a soccer player with good
credentials and wells of talent, has a

decision to make—where to apply to 4
‘college? --

After weeks of insurmountable
personal conﬂict and self-evalua-
tion, Nigh decides to choose Pitt,
hoping to be reunited with an older,
much-loved sister who happens to
be enrolled there as well.

Meanwhile, in his Pittsburgh
ofﬁce, Leo Bemis, a knowledgeable
veteran soccer coach, sits" at his
desk searching for new, young
talent to bolster his team for the
future.

The plot thickens as Nigh’s high
school coach sends a telegram to
Bemis informing him of Nigh’s
ability and arrival.

The action whirls‘ to a frenzied
pace as Bemis contacts the sister,
whom he knew beforehand, talks
with her and, through her, is able to
correspond with Nigh himself.

Event after event builds to an
exciting climax,
convinced
soccer team. V

And he makes the team,
thankfully. For Nigh, now, a
sophomore, has contributed‘ im-
mensely to the Panther cause
during his two injury-ﬁlled seasons,
scoring one goal against the
ﬁghting Irish of the Universityof
Cork and also the game-winning
tally in a 1-0 conquest of St. Vincent.

“He’s a skilled and (versatile
player,” Bemis agreed. _ “He
certainly has promise for the future
and is one of the players who will
come to the front.”

But it’s been a rough road
Injuries and
position changes have formed
hurdles, which normally would-

frustrate an athlete. But Nigh has .
been at his best no matter where 

he’s played’.

. ‘HAIIZLI w,ant.t<>fdo is play to ‘the? 
fmy.ability_,”, he claimed‘. .-‘,»‘  f

 

"as Nigh is

 

just want to make.the team the bes
it can be.” 1

Due mostly to a knee injury, Nigh
was placed on the left-wing at
midseason, a bit of a change from
the halfback position he held last

year. After that, Pitt beat Gannon _

3-2 in the very first game the change
was made, and Bemis hasn't
changed it back since.

“Really, I played offense last
year," Nigh said. “I played
halfback. There’s really no
difference. ’ ’ 5

But there is a difference -in this
year’s Panther squad. Pitt has a
legitimate chance of ending the

season over the .500 mark—if it can

beat Lock Haven (5-4-1) tonight, at 7
in Pitt Stadium. ’

“This year, we have a lot more
potential,” Nigh stated. “We’ve
had chances to score more goals.
Everyone has the ability to score.”

Especially Nigh, who is consider-
ed one of the better ball control men
on the squad by his teammates.

‘ ‘He’s the best ball control player
on the team, ’ ’ lineman Randy Gyory
‘said. ‘ ‘Everyone on the team would
agree. ’ ’

Everyone also would am-ee that
this year’s squad is improved.

"‘1ne team's more enthusiastic
this year,” Nigh commented. “A.
winning season is realistic right:
now.

“The fans are more enthusiastic’
too,” he continued. “Last year,
we’d have about 50-100 people at a
match. This year, the average has
deﬁnitely gone up. The team really
appreciates the support given by
Pitt students and others. There are
deﬁnitely things ahead for Pitt
soccer.” 5

Majors’

season, but Syracuse is an improved
team, winning three of their last
four games, including a 3-0
squeaker over always-tough Tu-
lane. The only loss in Syracuse's
recent turn-around came against
Penn State, 27-3.

“They will probably be the most
physical team we will have played in
several weeks,” Majors said of this
week’s opponent. “They're always
agressive; they always come at you
on defense with everything they
have.

“They’re aggressive, they’re
physical,” he stressed again, “and
I know that Coach (Frank) Maloney,
in this game, would like nothing
better than to unseat us from our
number two ranking.”

Though Syracuse is known for
producing those “big name”
performers-—Larry Csonka,~ Jim
Brown, Floyd Little, Ernie Davis
and Jim Nance, the most notable-
they are lacking one this season,
though sophomore quarterback Bil}
Hurley is touted by many to join the
group by the end of his collegiate
career.

“Since Hurley gained more
experience, our offense improved
considerably ‘and began to even off.
I'm somewhat disappointed with

our start, because that position sort
of choked us offensively.”

Nevertheless, no matter how
much the Syracuse offense sput-
ters, Majors is worried and hopes
his players feel as much apprehen-
sion as he does.

“They’ve done a ﬁne job in
maturing and I would,be very, very
surprised if our football team
overlooked anybody,” Majors said.
‘ ‘Because Ithink they know there’s
a lot at stake and they realize that all

Panthers can get back to concentra-

championship, though Majors in-

with a win over the Orangemen,
whom Pitt plastered 38-0 last
season.

“Syracuse I’m sure has a lot of '

revenge in their hearts to pay us

“However, you don't win be-

cally. “You try to benefit from the

Wish Comes True:
Pitt To Face

Number-One Michigan

BY DAVID McDONALD

The Pitt Panthers face number-
one ranked Michigan this weekend.

Don't get excited football fans,
Johnny Majors isn't pulling a fast
one on you--the Pitt cross—country
team faces Michigan, along with
more than 15 other teams in a
five-mile race at the Central
Collegiate Conference meet at Kent
State University.

Defending champion Michigan
and runnerup Penn State are the
favorites to take one and two again.
'1 he Panthers, who ﬁnished a very
respectable third last year, must
look to knock offone or both of these
teams for a possible invitation to the
NLAAs

Last year's second-place finisher,
beorge Malley of Penn State, who
qualified for last summer's Olympic
trials in the Steeplechase, is back
this year in top form. He will be
favored to take individual honors
but should get a good race from
Pitt's Mel Boyd.

Boyd and the Panthers should
have a slight advantage over some
of the other teams since in past
years they have run on the mostly
flat courses with a few rolling hills.
(It helps to know where you are

wgoing when you have to run five
miles fast. )

the Panthers need to give 100%

if they expect to improve on last

years finish. It will take a better
finish than last year if the Panthers
want to go to Nationals, and they
know this well.

lhe Panthers will try to knock off
Michigan on Saturday. It won't
help the Pitt football team much,
but it will certainly bolster the cross
country team's hopes for number
UIIC.

BY JOHN FINN

There wasn't too much to get
excited about at the women’s
volleyball match Tuesday night at
Duquesne—unless you were a Pitt
fan.

The surprising young Panther-
ettes were in complete control of
each match as they swept all three
teams in the quadrangular match
and raised their season mark to
16-2.

Pitt began by trouncing West

Virginia, 15-1, 15-6, and ended
with a rout of the host team,
Duquesne, 15-7, 15-2. In the
meantime, they -defeated Clarion,
15-2, 15-12. .
“Let’s face it,” said Pitt coach
Mike Hebert, “we didn’t play the
toughest teams in the east, but you
have to play consistant ball against
everyone to be a winner.”

The irony is that Pitt never used
the same line-up in any two games
and still dominated. “I think the

Women Set For SUNY Showdown

BY MARIA SCIULLO

Tliere’s something big going on

.,. this weekend and it involves a lot of

running around and a lot of people

dressed up in different colored

outﬁts and it’s not Halloween. So,
what is that something?

That “something” is the Eastern
Association for Intercollegiate Ath-
letics for Women (EAIAW) cross
country championships, to be held
at the State University of New York

- (SUNY) in Albany on Saturday.
Two Pantherettes, Becky Falck and
Brenda Chorpenning, will be
making the trip to New York this
afternoon. ‘

These two runners will have to
make an adjustment to the'SUNY
course, for it is reportedly
hard-surfaced and fairly ﬂat.

Coach Mary Ellen Shea is
optimistic about her athletes’

chances. “Although I’m not quite
sure exactly how stiff the competi-
tion will be, I think Becky (Falck)
could ﬁnish in the top 10 and
Brenda (Charpenning) should do
well, too,” she said.

Falck, a North Hills High School
graduate who holds two WPGAL
records, has set several standards
for herself.

“I’d like to make the top 10,”
she said, “but I’d also be happy
just to do my best. My goal right
now is to beat Donna Gardner from
Penn State.”

Gardner, the 1975 and 1976
PIAA cross country champion, has
edged out the Pitt runner on
several occasions in the past two
years.

For Chorpenning, cross country
is still a fairly new experience? The
freshman from Wheeling, W. Va.
played volleyball andbasketball, as
well as running track for Triadel-
phia High School. During her
junior year, she was state champ in
the 880-yard and mile runs, and in
1976,‘ repeated her half-mile
success and was fourth in mile

- competition.

When asked about her pre-race
strategy, she explained, “For once,

' I’d like to keep my pace going, run

a faster, harder pace throughout
the entire race instead of relying on.
akick at the end.”

Penn State, that ever-present
threat to win a national champion-
ship, may find some "surprisingly
good team competition from the

A Boston-area colleges tomorrow.

games showed how much depth we
have,” he said. “The majority of
the kids sitting on our bench could
start for any of the teams we
played."

Hebert was especially pleased
with Tuesday’s performance be-
cause his team had been letting
down against weaker teams._ “We
haven’t played as well as I would
like against the lesser teams,” he
said, “but tonight we kept
pounding away and never let
down.” , _

The Pitt squad is in Maryland
today for an eight-team tournament
at Salsbury State College. They
return home on Nov. 6 for the
season ﬁnale—another quadrangu-
lar match with Indiana University
of Pennsylvania, Edinboro and
Ohio State.

The team is anticipating a bid to
Eastern Regionals at Edinboro on
Nov. 19. “I can't see us being
denied a bid with a 16-2 record,”
said Hebert.

Bowlers Spared
3-Game Snutout

BY JERRY VILLELLA

The Pitt bowling team logged its
first victory of the early season,
taking the final game of a
three-game match with Washington
and Jefferson last Saturday at
Strand Lanes.

1 he Panthers, who lost the first
two games, 853-779 and 916-767,
rallied for a tight 887-882 shutout-
avoiding win, thus raising their
point record for two matches to
2-12. (In the Western Pennsylvania
Intercollegiate Bowling Congress,
each single-game win is worth two
points; total pins, one point. Thus,
a match is worth seven points.)

'1 hough disappointed with his
team's performance so far, captain
Ueoff Joseph was more than
pleased with the third game victory.

“It was a total team effort that
helped us come back and beat a
strong W&J team," he said. “We
put a lot of strikes together and
came up with our best effort yet this
season."

'1 he Pitt team was paced by
freshman Steve F endler, whose 572
series was the best of either team.
Seven bowlers in all saw action in
the match, including three fresh-
men, an indication that the team is

still trying. to settle on the best

combination of young talent. _
'lh’e youthfulness of the squad
has been shown in each of the first
two matches. Against Beaver
Community College and W&J, the
team fell far behind in the first two
games and had to rally in the third.
