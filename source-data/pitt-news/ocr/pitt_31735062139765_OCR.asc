Faculty, Alumni
Split On, ‘Should
Pitt Play LSU?’

Carver, James, Arther, Ferguson,
Ayars——Yes ; Tyson, Grove,
Thomas, Ha-11ock—No

Ayes Have It, 5 To 4

The Pitt. News today presents
its faculty and alumni consensus
on:

“Should Pitt play Louisiana
State u11ive1'sit,v ’s basketball team.
111 view of conditions there?”

The. faculty members and

alumni asked split live to four, de-
ciding by a majority of one that Pitt

 

should play “the team that Huey
built.”
Pitt—l-atest ﬂashes said——would

play the game in Atlantic City, April
13. although the Athletic Council has
yet to vote.

The opinions:

Dr. Francis D. Tyson, professor of

economics:

“W & J was right when it took a
stand in the matter and refused to
send a delegation to Louisiana. As
long as Huey Long controls the uni-
versity, I think we should have noth-
ing to do with it.”

Frank F. Carver, publicity director,
department of athletics:

“Students of -Louisiana State should
not have to pay for what some poli-
tician may or may not do. I think we
should play the game."

R. E. Grove. ’16, formerly of the
Athletic Council:

“l’d leave it up to the boys. If they
want to take the trio, let them do it.
Personally, I don't favor the idea.”

Dr. Alfred P. James. professor of
history and member of the Athletic
Eligibilty committee:

“I've talked with members of the
Louisiana State faculty and have

found no particular mistreatment. Pol-'

ities should not interfere with educa-
tion or sports."

VV. J. Thomas, ’21,
athletics ﬁgure:

“Under present --conditions
think Pitt should play Louisiana. Po-
litical entanglements one such that
Huey Long and basketball just don’t
rni.,_n

William C. Arther, iIISi.I‘1lC‘-‘nr in
commerce and member of the Athletic
Eligibility committee:

“We’re trvinn to find out who has
the best basketball team. Huey Long's
tactics have nothing to do with it. I
think Pitt has the best team in the
(‘.r\l.mtry, and I’d like to see them
play.”

John VV. W’. Hallnck. secretary Gen-
eral Alumni association:

“I don't think we ought to play
Louisiana. The reasons are obvious."

Dr. Russell J. Ferguson. associate
professor of history and former foot-
bau «roar-l1:

-""'!-a km/-: from Louisiana are un-
doubtedly gentlemen and good sports.
2 -» + *ee whv gentlemen should not
play one another,

Robert D. Ayars. professor of ac-
crumtinsz a.nd member of the Athletic
Eligibility committee:

“Huey Long shouldn't influence us.
Everything we hear from there is 100
per cent rumor. There is no good rea-
son why we shouldn’t play.”

No Quick Cure For  Years Hard
Living, Psychologist States

formerly Pitt

"‘There never was any cure and
Hmre never will be any quick cure for
twenty years of uuhygienic living; no
lwokus-pokus can make up for a life-
time of bad digestive habits. There
is a great ﬁght to be waged. The pub-
lic wants these simple cures, it wants
a few pills; it isn't willing to spend
the time in a long period of rest and
proper treatment.”

Dr. VV. '1‘. Root, head of the psy-
chology department, spoke thus be-
fore the Chi R0 Nu-sponsored Pre-
med club Vveclnesday at the Y huh
explaining the relationship between
ps_vchology and medicine.

Medicine and psychology work un-
der the same difficulty, Dr. Root said.
People with mental abnormalities ex-
pect,a psychologist to wave a wand
and cause ten years of bad habits to
disappear miraculously. They rush
into a doctor's office and expect him
to give them a “few pink pills” and
expect to get well. By this “every
doctor is tempted into charlatanism
by the public,” he said.

Re—education, Dr. Root believes, will
be necsssary, especially in regard to
“preventive medicine.”

A person’s overwhelming interest
in “a dimple or the nape of a neck”
Dr. Root defined as a. bias in ideas.
-‘They Soon get tired of looking at the
same dimple, though, if the)’ 113-V6 t0

Henry, F irstﬂarbinger Of Spring Just In
From South, Complains 0f Campus Snubs

“Ah. nuts!”

Henry, Pittsburgh's most widely-
advertised robin and generally recog-
nized as the first arrival here from
the South, took another half-hearted
peck yesterday at his bit of bread and
dropped it on the Cathedral lawn in
disgust.

“This business is getting on my
nerves,” he explained. “I can't even
eat“-any more. Here it’s the official-
open‘ing‘of’spring and I haven’t got

 

any notice yet."

He muttered, and no wonder.

At his right wing. two fellows with
white shoes trotted along blithely——-
they would get written up. Across
the street, kids were playing marbles
-——they’d get their pictures in the pa-.
per.

Henry meditated the comparative
advisability of turning in a false
alarm or doing a _st.rip_ act in front of
State hall to gain“attention, but he
picked uphis tail and'"swished up to

an open window on the eighth ﬂoor.
With a last-minute inspection of.his
glossy red waistcoat, Henry alighted

on the sill, assumed his best photo-

graphic grimace, and tapped. Nothing
happened.

With a red-l1ot robin “ﬁddlesticks,”
Henry swirled into the room, sneered
at the littered copy desk and vacant
typing desks, and spun onto the keys
of a typewriter. “F-r-f-r-f-r-f-r," he
exercised. Then he typed out this
story.

formal banquet of the conference, in

speaker, will be seven to eight-min-
ute speeches on: "What college has
done to me.” SDGGCIIBS on- this lat-
ter subject, according to the frater-

which they arouse the reaction: “How
funny” or “I-low interesting.”

Participants in the formal debates

on the international shipment of arms
question, will not be selected by try-
outs, but will be named by the men’s

Players’ Nerves
Showing Strain

Cast Of “March Hares” Wards
' Off Neurasthenia

   

.._o

By Hannah Raphael

As mad as the I-Iatter’s'tea party,
lribblefs “March lf-lare.s” is doing its
best to turn the Pitt Players’ rehear-
sal group into nutty temperamental-
lSlZS. ROODJ 315, Alumni hall becomes
strongly reminiscent of a ward for the
neurasthenic as the characters wan-
der through the acts, querulously in-
sisting on the most unimportant points
and completely disregarding the im-
portant facts of life.

An unexpected guest, Joseph Wasel,
arrives with bags and trunk and dis-
rupts the Rodney menage to the ex-
tent that Geoffrey spends the night on
the living-room sofa. This leads to
much nocturnal visiting and not a
few compromising situations.

Louise McKirdy faints as Charles
Foreman slaps her, only to be revived

.by the unquestioning and handy
Mother Janet, disguised as Ruth
Shapiro. .Ethel_ the maid, has what

amounts to a slight case of nervous
prostration, while the cook is too
busy trimming a new hat to pay much
attention to the dinner. Everything
from the cocktails to sandwiches are
thrown into the ﬁreplace, and Paul
Stinner as Oliver is incidentally sent
out to buy an extra. bed.

Mother Janet has everyone_ in then

cast busy keeping her from sitting
in bowls of soup and cups of coffee,
and Geoffrey goes to sleep, under an
eiderdown after chasing his guests off
the sofa. ‘With photographs, books.
and olives, everyone chases" around
until a Mr. Brown arrives to settle
everything at the opportune moment.

If the cast is still on this side of
Mayview April 10. there will be a
hilarious time in the old town, they
say.

A New Problem

HE IDEA of letting students

gi-ado the professors and ﬁnd-
ing out what students really
think about their pedagogucs has
cauglit the fancy of a remarkable
number of college papers. If
there have been any professorial
cars burning of late, they have
had good reason.

The Daily Maroon of the Uni-
versity of Cliicago ()1fci's a list of
seven 1‘eqiiireii1cii’rs for the tcacli-
or which may be accepted as cov-
ering the in-attor preiliy well:

1. He must have a syinpatlictic.
iiiidcrstandiiig of the liuinzin per-
soii-alit_v, and 1111181‘ bear in mind
‘lllilt his responsibility is not to
sizlijccts, but to human beings.

 He must be a teacher, not
a raslmiastei‘.

Isl. His purpose must be to de-
velop, not to iiu'loctriiiat.c.

4. He must. have knowledge,
not only iiiforniatiou.

5. He must be educated; he
must see his specialty in the light
of knowledge as a whole.

6. He must be ll1l(‘lllg‘Glll; he
must be imbued with a zeal for
growiiig in knowledge.

A 7. As far as possible he must
not feed his studciits with rehash-
cd mental food, but strive to send
Tll(‘.ll1. to the springs of knowledge,
to the great original minds of the

ages, through whom they may be ~

inspired with the spirit. of learn-
ing.

\Vifli that question. out of the
way, the real problem. is brought.
to the fore. Just. how we will
proceed to measure coinpl.iance
with these adinirable principles
on the part of individual faciilty
men, is the next issue to be takeii
up b_y press and public.

student of the ’twentics,” VValter
A. J essup, president. of the foun-
dation and former president of
the University of Iowa, writes.
“He is a liard-workiiig, serious-
inindcd person who demands more
of the college library, the labora-
tory and the instructor than did
his brother a decade ago.”

Other sectioiis of the report
warn that a struggle for survival
among American colleges is iin-
smineiit. Dr. J essup points out
ihat the United States has 800
institutions of higher learning,
while in the British ‘Isles-there
are only 25. For many of these
American colleges, survival has
already become the dominating
object, the report submits.

In the long run colleges will be
evaluated by their success in
maintaiiiiiig themselves as seats
of learning for students and staff.
“Survival” is indicated for the
college, not necessarily with the
ll1'OSl. money, that unfailingly ded-
icates a faculty of teachers to the
implications of the present, as
well as to the content of our past.
AMERICAN students in Germany
have a nifty way of getting even
for the way they are required to
give the Nazi salute. Students
who have recently returned say
they simply grin, raise their
hands and lustily shout, “Heel
Hitler.” 3 ' '

of allowing the impetus to study to

Dear Secretary

_\Yith the help of a generous outlay
of tunds in the right place, The Pitt
News was able to obtain the following
darb written by a. University pl‘0f,2
Treasury Department,
Wusliington, D_ C.
Gentlemen:

The enclosed form, on which I am
asked to make a record of my income
for the last ﬁscal year, is returnecl
‘I-0 You With my deepest appreciation
of this subtle form of ﬂattery. I was
particularly iiiiprcssed by its resur-
rection of old forms and ﬁgures of
Englishlspeecli, such as “compensa-
tion 1‘i'om outside sources,” “net proﬁt
received," “income from rents” and
“interest on bank deposits.”

One question I got a. great laugh
out of was, “VVe1‘e you during the tax-
able year supporting in your house-
hold one or more persons closely re-
lated to you?” Boy, that's a. honey!

Say, Mister Secretary, you would
be surprised! There are so many
persons closely related to me staying
at my house that I am what you
would call surrounded.

I can’t identify half of them, and
what burned me up was when my
wife's Uncle Jerry, who has been liv-
ing with us a. year, slapped me on the
lback the other day and asked,

It’s an ultra-short wave radio telephone antenna—before

being raised above..the dunes

of Cape Cod.

For some years, Bell System engineers have been studying
ultra-short waves. They have developed automatic trans-
mitters and receivers which may be connected with regular
telephone lines at pointsfar from central oﬂices. They hope
such radio links will be useful in giving telephone service

to points diﬁicult to reach
by usual methods.

The installation on Cape
Cod—which is now under-
going service tests——_is just
one more example of Bell
System pioneering in the
public interest.

i0lll()l'l'0\\' afternoon at inc Hotel

Four entrants are picked for eaché

divi.-;iC-11, the nomination being based
on the past season's performances.
Six schools will be represented in the
i-hainpionships: Pitt, Temple, Du-
quesne, W'est Vir-
,<2'inia.,, Bucknell
and Carnegie
Tech.

C 0 a c h Jack
St.-hricker will en-
ter a strong team
in the hope of an-
nexing several in-
dllvidu-al titles
:1 nd the team
0 h a In p i o nship.
The Pitt entrants
include Captain
Jimmy Giannatti,
Speigel, Kop p.
Paslowski, and
Stoughton.

Three of the winners of individual
titles last year will participate again
in this year's contests. \Vest Vir-
ginia, the defending champ, is paced
by two of the individual title holders,
Puglia in the 115-pound class and
Gallo in the 165-pound division, while
ﬁne third is Pethick, of Bucknell, in
the light—l1eavyweight division.

The Panther mittmen are headed
by Captain Jimmy Giannatti, who will
be making his ﬁnal bid for an Eastern
(fonference title. The Pitt captain,
who ranks high in Collegiate light-
weight circles, has enjoyed a success-
ful season. losing only one bout in six
;<lal'tS. His lone defeat was at the
hands of Vachereese, of Vvest Vir-
giiiia. last week, in a bout which had
ihe Mountaineer ﬁght fans on their
feet from start to ﬁnish. As these
TWO boys are the class of the light-
weight division, Giannatti will in all
iv:-obabilify have a chance to avenge
this setback in the championship
bout.

S-peigel, Paslowski Favored

Bernie Speigel, the Panther welter-
weight, and Al Paslowski, who fights
in the 125-pound class, are also looked
upon as good bets to cop individual
iiiles. Each of t.he boys has won
four bouts while dropping two during
the season. Speigel’s record includes
one knockout victim, while Paslowski
has two to his credit.

Gene Stoughton and Joe Kopp are
the other Panther entrants._ Stougl1-
ion will encounter plenty of opposi-
iion in the light-heavyweiglit division
in which the entrants are headed by
ihe defending champion, Pethick, of
Ilucknell. Coach Schricker is conﬁ-
dent that Kopp will give a good ac-
count of himself, despite the fact that
he is handicapped by an eye injury
suffered during the Navy match.

The tournament bouts will each be
of three rounds’ duration. In case of
:1 draw. a fourth round will be fought
to determine the winner, The win-
ner in each class will receive a gold
medal, and the runner-up will be
awarded a silver one.

The Pitt team, accompanied by
(‘oach Schricker, and Varsity Man-
ager Charles Ebert will leave for Mor-
gantown Friday noon, returning Sat-
urdry night, following the champion-
ship bouts.

The officials for the tournament will
be John Gallagher, Wheeling, referee;
(‘heater Smith, Pittsburgh Press
sports columnist, and George H. Phil-
lips, Vvlieeling, judges; and A. C.
Couch, Pittsburgh, timer.

' West For Butler
Indoor Carnival

Relayers Seek Additional Honors
In Annual Indianapolis Track
And Field Championships

Coach Carl O1son’s varsity track
team went west this morning, I-I.ow-
ever, they are not going to the same
place that soldier boys go, they are
§'JGiDg, instead, to participate in the
annual Butler university indbor re-
lays held at Indianapolis, Indiana,
where on Saturday afternoon and
evening leading track and ﬁeld stars
of the midwest will gather for the
season's ﬁnal national indoor meet.

Leading the group of Panther per-
formers in the carnival is the crack
mile-relay team whose record to date
in competition shows only one black
mark, that one caused by the Holy
Cross outﬁt in the IC-1A meet a few
weeks ago in New York. In their last
two appearances, the baton-passers
have accounted for two new records.
At Notre Dame in the Central Inter-
collegiates, the qiiartet of quarter-
milers ran the mile in 3 minutes, 21.3
seconds, which time, incidentally, is
probably the fastest mile—relay that
has been run this season. Last Saturday
the boys knocked their own Armour
Tech mark for a loop, doing the 5,800
feet in 3 minutes, 21.9 seconds.

-Conditions may be a little tougher
at Iiidianapolis for ‘Messrs. Kiger,
Groat, lVlcDonald, and Connelly due to
the fact that most of the Big Ten
schools are planning to enter strong
relay team-s. Micbigaifs Big Ten
champs will have their undefeated re-
lay squad on the track, along with
Ohio State, Indiana, Purdue, and
Notre Dame. -

The baton-passers ﬁnished third in
last year’s event, trailing the Indiana
and Ohio State runners. The winning
time for the Hoosier state lads was
3 minutes, 29.1 seconds, comparative-
ly mediocre time for that event, but
very creditable considering that the
Butler track was very slow. Accord-
ing to reports from the west, the
track has been considerably altered to
make a faster running service stifli-
ciently to make it one of the best in
the midwest.

Other Panther entrants will proba-
bly include Emil Bonavita who will
be in his favorite event, the shot-put.
Arvel Fleming, ﬂashy little Speedster,
will have to mingle with the two lead-
ing United States speed stars in Jesse
Owens, Ohio State, and Willis VVard,
Michigan. He will also perform in the
60-yard low hurdles.

Olson will probably take along a
distance medley-relay team composed
of Kiger, Connelly, Kirkpatrick, and
Musico. The latter two men will
probably race in the mile event.

This is the ﬁnal indoor meet of the
year for the Panther runners unless
unexpected circumstances permit the
relay team to do a bit more traveling.

Miisliball On Deck!

All schools, fraternities, or other
organizations interested in Intra-
mural mushball should start rounding

 

 

- up their men it‘ they wish to enter a

team in this sport. Mr. Feeley urges
the teams to turn in their complete
entries as soon as possible.

Eveii though the Panther varsity
cagers insist upon cavorting around
the country playing playoff and post-
season games. Coach IVillie Kowallis
and his freshman basketball team
called it quits for the season last
week after the Little Panthers had
hung up their 15th victory in whipping
the West Virginia. frosh team at Mor-
gant wn, thus ﬁnishing a schedule of
18 games with the loss of only three
b'attles during the 1934-35 season.

Accordingly, it"s orchids to “Docky"
Kowallis, the stocky freshman coach,
and the tall band of frosh players.
Kowallis, who played under Dr. Carl-
son as a team-mate of the inimitable
Charlev Hyatt during the 1927-28 sea-
son, was serving his ﬁrst year as
freshman coach. From the start of
the season, in spite of only three
weeks previous practice, Kowallis had
his team clicking and consistently
playing good ball games, at times
passing and handling the ball on a
par with the varsity.

In the ﬁrst game of the season, the
Little Panthers gave evidence that
they were going places when they
easily knocked off McKeesport,High,
35-19, in the preliminary to the open-
ing varsity game with Bucknell. They
followed this victory by swamping
Taylor Allderdice, 52-17, and then
bumped into their ﬁrsi snag of the
season, the Duquesne yearling team,
and lost a close 33-29 thriller.

Here, the baby Panthers righted
themselves and clicked off ﬁve
straight wins, only to meet this same
Duquesne team and lose a heart-
breaking game in the last 10 seconds
by one point. Travelling to VVashing-
ton the following day, the Panther
Cubs made it two straight losses when

the crack Washington and Jefferson
team upset them, 43-39. However,

the Little Panthers claimed right to
a moral. victory since they piled up
four more ﬁeld goals than the Presi-
dents, only losing the game because
of W’ and J's skill at the foul line,
caging 17 fouls out of 25.
Coming down the home stretch of
the schedule the Panther Cubs had it
eight
straight games, all by lop-sided scores
This one was one of the

Lament So It io rs

Who Need $27.35

“Button, button, who has the but-
ton’:"’ That is the predicament of
senior women who are wondering
where the $27.35 worth of something
or other involved in Commencement
expenses is coming from.

It will cos't that amount for aca-
demic dress, cap and gown, the tradi-
tional sheepskin, and numerous. class
social events, all listed in “The
Pointer,” a, handbook distributed to
women of the senior class.

A luncheon for sophomore women
on April 15, the sunset dinner on
June 1, and a. boat ride and dance on
the night of Commencement will cost
graduating women a total of $3.35.

The academic dress selected last
week, to be worn at all events pre-
ceding Commencement, will cost $6.50.
The University makes a. charge of
$10 for the sheepskin, and $1.50 for
the rental of a. cap and gown. A bal-
ance of $3 on Owl subscriptions owed
by most seniors and $3 for Commence-
ment invitations set the grand total
at $27.35.

Other class affairs, which seniors
attend gratis, are: a tea for the Uni-
versity faculty on April 4, a tea for
mothers of senior men a.nd women
students on, May 8, Baccalaureate on

Senior Courl: Down

On The Count:

One . two .
and members of the
are down on the count.

Count one came last summer
when Frieda Goldstein, named as
a member of Senior Court for this
year_ married and left Pittsburgh.

Count two came when Lois Mil-
liken, who replaced the former
Miss Goldstein, announced her on-
gagement.

Count three was struck yester-
day when the marriage of Mildred
Shuh, and her decision not to re-
turn to school. were announced.
The former Court justice, now Mrs.
I-larry Schneider. was married by
her father, Reverend Fred 0. Schuh,
on January 1. Only the parents of
the couple were, present.

Mrs. Schneider, who left school
on F'ebruar_v 15 because of illness,
is a member of Delta Zeta fraterni-
ty, and was secretary of Panhellenic
Council. She will make her home
in Knoxville.

And providing the rest of the
justices do not become 1nat.rimoni-
ally-inclined, the Court will strug-
gle along with but four members.
Unattached members of Senior
Court are Mary Gertrude Herron,
chief justice, Lois Young, Marjorie
Reich, and Hazel Lincoln, ex officio
member.

Cho-rincs Jumble
Indian, Oriental,
Mo do rn Dances

. three
Senior Court

Begiiiiiinp: with the ceremonial
dance of the ﬁve Hiawath-as, the
rhythmic panorama. of the VVAA chor-
ines progressed from the writhings
of an Oriental Salome, through the
nymph-like dance of the three Hel-
lenic graces, and to the picturesque
folk‘ dances. Each folk dance was
divided into two parts; the lovely
wulka and the Bummel Schottische
(German); the Kanafaska and from
Pressburg to the Danube (Czecho-
slovakian); and the School of Czardas
and the Stick dance (Hungarian).

Next came a graceful ballet solo, a.
breezy and salty tap by four sailors
in the best ship ahoy style, and, as tlie
ﬁnale, a Dalcroze eurhytbmic dance by
six modernists garbed in black and
white.

One coed said, “Oh, I liked the folk
dances best. They were so sweet,
light, and natural.” Another remarked
that she liked all of the program, be-
cause she was “fond of European danc-
ing.” Still another coed raved about
the mechanical monotony of the mod-
ern dance, its rhythm, costumes, and
grace particularly. “The modern
dance was all right,” a freshman said,
“but the dancers couldn’t keep to-
gether because there wasn’t any
music.”

Other comments praised the authen-
ticity of the costumes, the originality
of the whole program, and the graceful
execution of the dance steps. To Miss
Elizabeth Rearick, professor of physi-
cal ed.1ca.tion, goes the credit for
coaching and staging all of the
dances. Suckers. dressed in shirred
black and white crepe paper dresses,
were the favors.

Alex Bogar’s Magyar gypsy orches-
tra furnished music for the entertain-
ment. ’

participating in extrarcurricular ac-
tivities is not receiving training sig-
niﬁcant in life values.” A model busi-
ness meeting was conducted by Dean
Amos, and o. Chickasaw-Choctaw In-
dian Princess, Te Ata, was one of the
speakers.

In 1933 the list of speakers at Lead-
er's Institute included Dean Vincent
