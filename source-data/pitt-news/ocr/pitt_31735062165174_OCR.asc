1000 Man-Hours Needed For Worthwhile Project

By ELVIRA TERNEY

; ' Help Week is branching out"

to new importance this year.
After the YMCA and Interim-
ternity Council helped take
some of the hell out of Hell
‘Week last year by assigning
[fraternity pledges to do_ con-
structive work instead of devil-
ment during their ﬁnal week of
pledging, the idea is spreading
like wildﬁre throughout the cam-
pus. M

Because of its success, popular-
ity. and recognition, the project
is in formation on a larger scale
thsi year.'The ofﬁcial name for the
week, ‘Feb. 6-10, is the Commu-
nity Service Help Week.

-Joining last year’s sponsors, the
YMCA‘ and IF, are the YWCA
and Pan Hellenic Council. Help
Week will aid, in _a unique way,
such various agencies as the
Western Pennsylvania School for
the Blind, the Home for Crippled
Children, the Home for Aged and

' Inﬁrm Colored Women, and the

Juvenile Court Detention Home.
To Give Physical Support
The agencies were secured
through the Voluntary Bureau of
Health & Welfare in Allegheny

' County. The project will give ac-

_tual physical support to these
agencies and others which need
it.

_ However, the campus groups
also beneﬁt by this type of pro-
ject, for they receive -favorable

_ publicity and establish good re-
lations between the ,University
and the community. '

The goal of 1000 man hours
must be acquired by the end of
Help Week. So far 800 man hours
have been accounted for. The Help
Week slogan is “Victory Is

" (H)ours.”

Female Groups Enter

Bradshaw Returns To School
After Communist Imprisonment

After. almost ﬁve years as a prisoner of the Chinese
Communists, Dr. Homer V. Bradshaw, medical missionary,
returned to the campusof his alma-mater, the University

Dr. Bradshaw, who graduated from the Pitt Medical
School in 1926, was released with his wife, Mrs. Wilda H.

Bradshaw, in Hong Kong on

Ed. ’56.

Dec. 20. Both will undergo

When asked if he felt that the

No One Goes/1 way_Mad»;
At Players’Latest 

By DON MILLER _ L ‘
How does it feel to take an excursion into madness? 7"

A madwoman can tell you. And what does she say? She
says that there is much common sense on the other side
of reality—-at least this is the great irony in the Pitt Players’
production, “The Madwoman of Chai1lot” by Jean Girau-
doux, French politician and writer.

There is an acute subtlety required of an
fantasy with the’ immediacy and¢ . ..

verve that will force the spectator

to suspend ideas he brought into’
. the theater and.a'ccept'the excit-
jing caprice of the play——so true-
in this case—which has a weird

power for making him see life

a the way life happens.

Reidmiller Poetic

Eugenie Reidmiller, as J the

poetic ‘and profound Countess Au-A

relia, found‘ herself in a role
‘which ._would’ demand the most
careful concentration‘ 011 a Lynn
Fontaine.-‘To say that she execu-
ted it well would be saying that
she met the demands, of a diffi-
cult part. .

She did this and mo\re in her
conscious achievement of the
character of the wise yet wistful
countess whose world has not the
turbulent and fluctuating values
of our own——her interesting voice,
proﬁle, and makeup added stage
magic to the Players’ first night
performance.

No less important in ‘scope
was the Ragpicker, played by
Conrad Penrod, who also had
the.lead in “Bernardine.” While
Penrod is perhaps more a vet-
eran in student productions, in
this writer’s opinion, he has
learned much since h-is earlier‘
role.

With the innate humility of his
part, he was able to set aside the
Ragpicker’s objectives, as direct-
ed—possible in fantasy- and_ to
defend the monied class in a .tre-

_mehdous oration to which the‘

playwright makes him superior
justibecause of that humility.

If Mr. Penr_od could attempt to
appear a little less smug as to his
style and yet let his talent flash
through, for it is there, his as-
,sumed humility ' would be defi-e
nitely deepened, ‘and his acting

indeﬁnite.

would become more memorable.

 Faitlt on Campus

' The formal establishment of a Council of Religious

 — organizations on campus last Tuesday indicates the grow-

L ing recognition ofvreligious activity which has been im-
1 portant to many students at the university. For no less
 than "four years, Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant students

}have had_ representative bodies. functioning at Pitt.

if ~ \ That administration has permitted organization of the
_. groups into an integral representative body-shows a secular
 institution must recognize the role it plays in both moral
' and materialieducation of its students. . ‘ "
~ It is unlikely that college experiences will radically
I change an individual’s personal belief. He has grown up
too long surrounded by home environment for four college
years to exert undue influence. However, reaction to super-
stitious. religious ideology may certainly result from the
:,+a'~'..b1=.o,adening experience of secular education. A student may
 lfurther confuse himself by meeting up with religious be-
lief that is the antithesis of his own. It is disconcerting.
The individual ‘religious organizations on ‘campus. at-

Nesting Wars

A gypsy covey of good-humored birds are
laughing at you. They hop around the Tuck
Shops, onto the first ﬂoor, around the clock on the
ground ﬂoor. They manage to guide themselves
into elevators in order to.reach the eighth and
twelfth ﬂoors, but have difﬁculty walking around;
they have trouble standing on their two feet.
They look solemn, many of
them. Those more ambitious
birds who hop around fastest
pride themselves on their ‘ﬁne
coxcombs, while older, more ex-
perienced of the covey, droop.
A thoroughly productive group,
the Silver Tongued Politicos usu-
ally lay eggs whenever they find
a roost.’ .

Inwardly, however, the birds
you permitted them to strut,
despite their notorious laziness. They are in them-
selves, unusual Ioirds‘ who learn to warble sweetly
only during the spring semester. Afterwards, be-

 
 
  
 
   
  
 
 
 
  

cause of short memories with which nature plagued.

them they stop warbling until the following spring.

The Silver-tongued Po.liticos nest in such places,

as Student Congress, Men’s‘ Council, IF Council,
and they have been known to send their mates to
such far away places as Pan—Hellenic Council or

manner might shake them from their roost. It
places MC prexy Dimitri Petro in a frightfully
embarrassing position.

Petro, who has not minded so much the birds’
presence as he has their irregularity of presence,
ﬁnally urged fellow representatives to pass legisla-

.tion that would boot the spring Warbler out of

council. But, having already" constructed a ﬁrm
nest, the birds withstood all opposition.

Atipresent, Petro’s only hope is that when they
fail to show up, he can bar the door discouraging
them from ﬂying back. However, if the silver-
tongued politicos maintain station, they will cud-
dle up in a softcorner, snooze off as is their wont,
and let the president lecture as is 'his _wont to
any of the covey that may show curiosity in the
proceedings. ' L .

From Sedate Blue To Red

However, the laughing warblers are not to be

- taken so lightly as this writer may have suggested.

‘Although they band together to chide ,those of you
who let them enter, they change ‘color from sedate.
blue to violent red at the same time they re-
educate themselves to warble.

In the spring, Silver-tongued Politicos wage
nesting wars to gain either higher perches or else
to restore thosewhich had fallen apart due to wan-

ton neglect. The birds scream at each other across;

distances as "great as the length of the Commons

“representative council in all

a larger percentage of women
will be staying in the Oakland

At present only 17.8% of Pitt

’Little is known about long-

Why doesn’t Congress really

In addition to the possibility.of.

‘the Assemblies Committee surely

would have staged some sort of
all-University celebration for the

Blair Pumip-s__45 Points;

  Game Marked By Fouls

_ By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Geneva’s Covies “fouled” their way to a 98-79 win over
the Panther cagers Saturday night to hand Bob Timmons’
crew their sixth loss of the campaign. They have nine W1IlS.
, , A Beaver Falls standing room crowd of 2,000 watched
the whistle tooters take charge of the game that at times

I -resembled a foul shooting contest more thanit did a basket-

ball ‘game.

-Over 100 charity tosses were

I attempted with the Timmonsmen

feeling the effects of the Covies’

,,6,1._attemp_ts on which they sank
‘46. The best the local could do

was 29 of 42.
Blair‘ Scores 45

Hotshot Billy Blair didn’t help
the. Panther cause much as he
dazzled the fans with a 45 point
scoring barrage. This was per-
haps the greatest game of his

, career- and the point total fell just‘

one shy of tying the Covies all-
time "record for a single game.
which is held by Stan Yukica.—
Cliff A‘ultman’s hoopsters were
not only having a banner night
from the charity station,‘ but
their 50 per cent accuracy from
the ﬂoor merely added to the
Panther woes.
The Jungle Cat’s star "forward
'6-4 John_ Riser, who played only

g two minutes, sat out the ﬁrst 3.0

minutesof the game with a jam-
med hand which he sustained
against West Virginia three nights
earlier. / ,
Panthers Foul Out
About two minutes after Riser

 was lifted, Julius_Pegues fouled

‘out. Joe Fenwick followed suit as

0 the Covies began to pull away to

the delight of the partisans.
The Blue and Gold edged to

a 4-0 lead at the start on a pair
of ﬁeld goals’ by Pegues. Geneva
quickly tied the ‘count at”4—4,
and went ahead until the Tim-
monsmen knotted it at 8-8 on a
jump shot by Bob. Lazor.

Blair then tossed in a two-
pointerfor a 10-8 Geneva margin
which ' they never relinquished
throughout the game. -

Hursh Narrows Gap

The opposition had as much as"

a twelve point lead late in the
first half before a Panther spurt
cut it to 48-41 at halftime.
Chuck Hursh narrowed the
gap to 48-45 within 30 seconds
after the second half tossup,
but that was the closest the
Oaklanders came the rest of the
game.

Sophomore Hursh took scoring
honors for the Blue and Gold
with 18. Hursh was followed by
Lazor with 16, JohnALaneve with
ten, Frank Zimmovan with nine
Pegues with eight, Fenwick with

six, and Eugene Cercone with
ﬁve.
Blair and Ken Woodeschick

paced the enemy with 45.and 21
respectively. 7’

The locals will now be idle'un-
til Feb. 1 when they meet their
Oakland rival, Carnegie Tech, at
the ‘Memorial Field House.

 

Something that never ceases to be amazing is the sky-
rocket rise of wrestling at "Pitt .' .4 . Seven years ago, Rex

., Peery came here‘ to start the sport. After an 0-10 star-ter,

the wrestlers have climbed just about to the very top . . ,.

If you've never seen a gym-
nastic meet, make it a point to
take in the" gym-wrestling

’ doubleheader at the Field House
this Saturday night . . . Notice
in particular (you can’t help it)
the ﬂying rings event . . . That’s
one contraption we couldn’t be
paid enough to latch onto . . .

In his encyclopedia of sports,
Frank Menke says of gymnasts,
“They execute, in a single eve-
ning, acts of greater daring, and
valiantly, more
muscular feats than some ball
players, and football stars, are
called upon to do in an entire
season.” And he’s not kidding.

At the wrestling meet with
Syracuse two~Saturdays ago, the
announcer commented over the

'  mike that Syracuse heavyweight

Dick Lasse, wrestling with Ron
Schirf at the time, was the end
on Syracuse’s football team
~who caught the TD pass that
beat WVU. . . . Lasse got a

rousing cheer from the F11
crowd.

In the opinion of Dick Cassiano,
former great Pitt halfback (team-
mate of Michelosen’s), ‘.‘Ray Di-
Pasquale is the most underrated
defensive player I’ve ever seen.”
. . . No argument there . . . (Ed.
note: Cassiano made these state-
ments, to the News two weeks
ago, well before the Steelers
drafted DiPasquale and three
other Panthers). , ,. ‘

Dick’ felt that" the Steelers’
couldn’t go wrong in « picking’
up Ray. . . Cassiano was also‘
high on Pete Neft, another whom
he feels the Steelers should
latch onto. . . Was. really great
to see that the Steelers felt the
same way. _ 

Also the -acquisition of Fred
Glatz and Bill Schmidt will help
the Steelers . . . Schmidt will
make a ﬁne punter’ for the pros
 . Glatz is one of the .most un-
derrated players in college.

Two-Milers r
Smash Record

Coach Carl Olson’s two—mile
track team continued to smash
records over the weekend as they
set a new time of 7:42.53 in the
Philadelphia Inquirer games Fri-
day night. , ‘ ‘ _

Then they competed in the Eve-
ning Star Games in Washington
Saturday night and notched their
third straight triumph of the in-
door season although, they posted
a slower clocking of 7148.5, _

In the Inquirer. games, Arnie
Sowell participated in the 1000-
yard run and came out the victor
over Torn Courtney former Ford-
ham,-star, and Ken Maynard, for-
mer Illinois star, by a good ten
yards in 2:l2.5. Sowell also ran
the anchor lap of the two—mile
run in 1:52.

The Star games saw Sowell
faced with a 20-yard deﬁcit to
make up after teammates Jim
Moore, Perry Jones, and Wendell
I-Iarford had run their half miles.
Sowell did this and had 40 yards
to spare at the ﬁnish as he turn-
ed in a brilliant 1251.2.

Steelers Drfdft
Four Gridders

Four Panther grid stars were
drafted last week by the Pitts-
burgh Steelers in the NFL drafts.
Transferring from Skyscraper U.
to Rooney U. will be end Fred
Glatz, quarterback ‘Pete Neft,
halfback Ray DiPasquale, and
guard Bill Schmidt.

The four Panthers will join
teammate Lou Cimarolli who
was drafted by the Steelers two
years ago when his class grad-
«uated, while Cimarolli was in the
Navy.

Schmidt, picked up for punt-
ing purposes, was the nation’s
third leading punter "this year.
Neft, taking over the ﬁeld gen-
eral’s duties early in the season,

turned out to be the surprise of

the year.

DiPasqua1e also -got off the bench
this year to show local fans some
of the ﬁnest defensive halfback-
ing seen in some time. .

Glatz, capable of playing ﬁrst-
string on practically any college
team, was forced to play second
ﬁddle to Joe Walton and John
Paluck——two _of the ﬁner ends in
the country. But it was a sweet
second ﬁddle for John Michelo-
sen’s powerhouse. *

Sawyer, Hennon
Give Panthers
Big Cage Boost

If the formula for success is
starting young, then freshman
basketball stars Dave Sawyer
(6-6) and Don Hennon .(5-9)
have put the formula to good
use. These two hoopsters, who
last. year led their respective
TChO0l to their ﬁrst state cham-
pionship crowns, started playing
basketball at the ripe old ages of
seven and four respectively. \

Sawyer, brother of Pittsburgh
Pirate farmhand Roger Sawyer
was the main culprit who brought
the first State Class B. Champion-
ship to his Mount Morris, N. Y.,
high school with a lusty 25 points

per game average. Dave says, “Our -

winning the charnpionsh-ip;was my

‘ biggest sports thrill.” V

Wampum’s celebrated Hennon
likewise cites his school’s ﬁrst
state title as his biggest thrill.
“That-’s what I wanted ever
since I was in the grades.”

Hennon attributes his basket-
ball success to his dad, L. B. Hen-
non, who is also coach of Wam-
pum’s Indians, Don says,
showed-_me everything to do and
then all I had to do was practice,
practice, practice.” Sounds easy
doesn’t it?

Dave also feels that his high

school coach-, Don Chichester, was.

mainly responsible forgetting him
this far in the hoop sport, Dave
comments “He showed me how
to get rid of some of my clumsi-
ness and he taught me the right
shots.” Dave’s fav.orite shot is a
one-hand jump which he .uses__to
advantage with his 6-6, 188-pound
frame. _ -- -
College Play’ers Smarter

«One thing on" which both Dave

and Don agree is that probably the

2, Cub Cagers’

_ /0 I '
String Snapped
All good things usually come
to aniend and Saturday night
proved no different as the Panth-
er, Cubs found their dream of

an unbeaten season smashed by
Geneva, 95-82. '

Except for the consistent shoot-
irig of Don Hennon, who regist-
ered 28 points for the eveningbe-
-fore he was waved out on fouls,

"the Geneva margin would have

been much- wider.

; Although Carl Peterson's cag-
ers lost by /13 points, they were
very much in the game until late
in the" second half when personal
fouls began to take toll on the
Jungle Cats.

With only three minutes gone
in the second half, Dave Sawyer
walked the plank via the foul
route. Sawyer’s departure after
netting 17 points was sorely felt

by-the Blue and Gold in the re-
bounding department. ' ‘

biggest difference between college
and high school basketba1_l is that,
“In college the players are a lot
smarter.” Hennon comments that
“It’s a lot-- harder to o_utsmart
players in college. .
But just one glance at the rec-
ords will leave one with the im-
pression that this hasn’t affected
these two cagers very much. That
is unless you call I-lennon’s 27
point per game average and Saw-
yer’s 19.point average, a poor
showing. -
Hennon, who was the only
high school sophomore to ever
make the All-State ﬁrst team,
was an 'All-State selection three
years straight, in addition to
being on the ‘honorable men-
tion in his freshman year. ‘
The number of scoring records
the crew-cut speedster has set
while in high school are almost as

numerous as the 62 colleges that‘

sought his ‘services. To name just
two, he holds the highest Pennsyl-
vania high school point total for
one game--54; the most points in
a high school career 2376 — this
record was previously held by a
pretty fair ball player named Tom
Gola. .

Gola, incidentally, is Sawyer’s
favorite sports character —- aside
from his own brother of course.

it wasia good school and i thought

What young people cltreldoing at General Electric

_Young scientist
works on new ways
to improve metals  

Today scientists and engineers face one of
. the toughest barriers of all — the “metal
barrier.” Modern technology has progressed
so rapidly that today’s metals can’t meet the‘
tremendous demands placed upon them. For
such ﬁelds as aviation, electronics, atomic
energy, present metals must be improved and
new kinds of materials must be developed.
R One of the young men playing a role in
this new and important ﬁeld is 30-year-old

Dr. Roland P. Carreker, Jr.

0arreker’s Work Interesting, Vital

As_ 31 research associate in the General Elec-
tric Research Laboratory’s Metals and
Ceramics facility, Carreker’s chief. concern
is the improvement of metals through new

processing techniques.

In his work, Dr. Carreker has dealttwith
such important metallurgical problems as
metal failure in high-speed turbine rotors,
determining the strength of pure metals
from ——425°F, the temperature of liquid
hydrogen, to 2,800°F and economic studies
of new metallurgical processes. 3

25,000 College Graduates at General Electric

When Carreker came to General Electric in
1947,’he already knew the work he wanted
to do. Like each of our 25,000 college-
-graduate employees, he is given a chance to
grow and realize his full potential. For Gen-
eral Electric has long believed this: When
fresh young minds are given ‘freedom to
make progress, everybody beneﬁts — the in-
dividual, the company, and the country.

DR. ROLAND CARREKER joined General
Electric in 1947 after receiving a B.S.
in 1945 and an _M.S. in 19477 at the

Caryl Armstrong

In 9-Year ‘Record .,

By DORSEY FORTINI

Can you imagine an evening

the U. S. Steel Co., law de-
partment and maintaining a
2.7 quality point average?
Though it’s taken 9 years, Caryl
Armstrong, Col.‘ ’56, has done it.

Caryl, though attending "evening
school since, 1947, won’t be among
those doing their commence--
ment gowns in June. Instea_d, she’ll
wear the outﬁt she has sglected
for.’ her marriage to Key Caltwall
in I-Ieina Chapel on Apr. 2.

Completes Semester

Miss Armstrong will complete
her last semester at the Univers-
ity of Chicago where she and her
future husband will be living
temporarily. Despite the “fact that
Caryl will be at another univers-
ity for her last semester, she is
entitled to receive her bachelor
of arts degree from the Univers-
ity_of Pittsburgh. ’

‘Her interest in literature is
reﬂected in her high regard for
the English Department which-
she ﬁnds “exceptionally good.”
Eventually Caryl hopes to teach
literature at one of the univer-
sities. The speciﬁc university
will be determined when she
and her future husband, em-
ployed by Koppers Co., will be
able to establish residence per-
manently. .
