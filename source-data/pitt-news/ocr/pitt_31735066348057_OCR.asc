“Ford Presents Inflation Cure

WASHINGTON AP - Warning
that inflation can “destroy our
country, our homes, our liberties,”
President Ford proposed Tuesday a
broad ranging anti-inflation pack-
age that would combine selected
tax cuts with selected tax in-
creases, special help for the
unemployed and new moves to
conserve energy.

In a nationally broadcast address
before a joint session of Congress,

V’ ford unveiled recommendations
‘ that varied little from what had
been expected.

As was widely reported in
advance, Ford asked Congress to
impose a temporary, one year tax
surcharge of 5% on corpofations‘
and middle and upper income
taxpayers. ’

The President also sought a
gliberalized, ‘across the board
“~"*'*°r‘—”‘ investment tax credit of 10 %

to encourage expansion of factories

and businesses.

To help the jobless as the

economy continues to slump - and

living costs rise - Ford proposed the '

creation of a new Community
Improvement Corps to provide
public service jobs when unem-
ployment exceeds 6 % nationally.

The current rate is 5.8 % and‘ is

Géxpected to increase.

' Under the Ford plan, the one year
jobs program would automatically
go into effect in locallabor markets

with high unemployment even if
the national average remained
below 6 %. Grants for jobs would
be triggered when local rates
exceeded 6.5 ‘/2. A

"Ford also speciﬁed thatito be
eligible for a public service job, an
individual would ﬁrst have to
exhaust all unemployment bene-
ﬁts.

In the energy area, Ford fixed a
goal of reducing imports of foreign
oil by one million_barrels a day by
the end of 1975. This would be
accomplished by increasing do-
mestic energy production and by
conserving oil.

To develop “a single national.

energy policy’ and program,” Ford
created a National Energy Board
headed by Secretary of the Interior
Rogers C. B. Morton.

One of _the President’s major
proposals would set a 1980 target
for “eliminating' oil ﬁred plants
from" the nation's base 'loaded
electrical capacity” by converting
to coal and uranium.

A fact sheet said the conversion
would be accomplished voluntarily
or the President would seek

. legislation to make it happen.

While rejecting proposals that he
ration gasoline or increase the tax
on gas, Ford said:.

“I will meet with top management

Education Profs Charge

Unfair Labor Practices

BY BRIAN DUNN

An unfair labor practices charge

was filed against the University

unions vying to become Pitt's
faculty bargaining agent.

The charge, made to the Penn-

questionnaire, called \ the
competence Based Teacher Evalu-
ation [CBTE], asks each faculty
member about his competencies,’

In a memo to.all University

was aimed at “interference, dis-
crimination, and unilateral changes
in the terms of conditions of

employment" by the administra-.

tion.

Reese_Stone, Communications Co-
ordinator for PSEA, claims the
CBTE will shift the emphasis of the
School of Education from educa-
tional objectives to management.

“We also feel the evaluation is
discriminatory as it wouldn’t be

-Pitt Trims

BY KEN GORMLEIY
The coupling of inadequate state
funds and skyrocketing prices has
forced Pitt to re-evaluate economic

‘priorities in order to survive it’s

precarious ﬁnancial situation, ac-
cording to Jack E. Freeman, Pitt's
chief planning and budget ofﬁcer.

With all of the expenses of
running a University mounting
continuously, and incoming reven-
ue remaining constant or diminish-
ing, the budget office has found it
necessary to filter out expenses
which are not essential, while
building up those which are
necessary to the University’s
growth.

“We are in the middle of a long
range planning program with long

range goals," said Freeman.
“We must address ourselves to
areas which help us achieve these
goals, nourishing programs which
are of the greatest importance both
to the University and to society.”

This, Freeman maintained,~can
only be accomplished by re-deﬁn-
ing priorities and diverting funds
from programs. of lower to higher
concern.

Signs of this policy are already
evident. The temporary elimination
of allocations to the Arsenal
Day-Care Center, which caused a
great deal of controversy last year,
was cited as one of the initial
attempts to economize finances to
meet the‘lack of assets. Funds from
janitorial services around the
University have also been extract-
ed, cutting such services to the

F.lcanor Streiss, head of the

‘County Health Dcpz-lrtmcnl's Com-,

municable Disease Center. also
said no epidemic is foresc<:ll. and
that no unusual rise this your in the
number of colds has been seen.

“Some type of inﬂuenza hits
somewhere every year. Last year it
was type B, and this year we are
expecting type A.

“Type A is no more dangerous or
fatal than B. although any such
virus can be more harmful to
elderly people," Streiss said.

“But for normally healthy adults,
type A is not dangerous, lasting
about a week."

Streiss said the Center for Disease
Control [CDC], a national health
agency, was reported to have
released a statement saying a
dangerous flu virus would hit the
US this winter, but she added the
CDC later denied issuing this
statement. Streiss said she was not
certain whether or not the CDC had
issued the report. I

She added, “V\:'e' don’t anticipate

any type of inﬂuenza epidemic this

yearH'

Streiss added colds are Striking 21
large number of people this year.

“Many people this year are
showing symptoms of the common
cold, but this is not attributable to
anything in particular.

“lt's ilormal this, time of year for
colds to increase in number be-
cause people are going back to
school and being exposed to others
who have colds."

Dr. Neil Zweig of the Falk Clinic
Health Service agreed an inﬂuenza
epidemic for this winter is .not
imminent. .

“From what we know, we don’t
foresee any epidemic this year. Of
course, you never know about an
epidemic until it happens,” Zweig
said. '

“An influenza epidemic cannot
really be predicted, unless we look
at what's gone in it Europe or
whatever place it's come from.”

A higher incidence of colds is not
apparent this year, said Zweig.

“Although colds are still reported
in fairly large numbers, we haven't
seen any noticeable increase over
the number reported in past
years."

going to have to be borne by the
state. It is for this reason that Pitt
requisitioned Pennsylvania for a
17% increase in the budget for
1975, as well as asking for an
additional $1.5 million in 1974

funds. This, Freeman believes, “is ‘

necessary if we want to break even.
There is no substitute for adequate
support from the State. We’re
literally dependent on it. Pitt is
going to try harder than ever to sell
its case in Harrisburg.”

Freeman was talrly conﬁdent that '

this urgent request will be met.

since “the State has indicated their
serious interest , in improving
education in Pennsylvania” in the
past few years.

Should the State not answer Pitt’s

plea for added ﬁnances, Freeman 

saw no solution other than
“tightening our belts still tighter.
We have to live with what life
brings us."

However, he did not see ,an
increase in tuition as an acceptable
solution, under any circumstances.

. Freeman stated. “Every
one at the University is opposed to

 

this."

Assistant City Planning Director
Billie Bramhall said any guidelines
drawn up should be presented to
her office “to see if they meet with
what is stated in the occupancy
permit."

Stickler outlined the agreement he

believed had been reached earlier
between the University and the
community concerning the Annex.

“It was meant to be used as a

commuter student’s lounge and a
community meeting place. i I think
it is obvious that the present uses
of the Annex are not in accord with
what it was set up for,” Stickler
said.

Stickler added many of the
present functions held in the Annex
“are objectionable to residents in
the area.”

Two—block committee member
and Oakland resident Robert Cas-

ciato outlined the committee’s
problems in dealing with the
University. “We’ve notiﬁed Dr.

Moye (vice-chancellor of Student
Affairs) about things happening in
the Annex and we have been totally
ignored. What’s to insure that this
won‘t happen again. If Dr. Moye
respected ODI or the community,
there wouldn't be this type of
entertainment on the fringe of the
community,” Casciato said. Moye
was out of town and could not be
reached for comment.

When asked for specific objec-
tions to the Annex, Casciato said,
“The place is a urinal. They use
the walls as urinals. There are
wine and beer bottles all over the
area. Community rsidents are
afraid to walk by the place at
night.”

Casciato added he had personally
contacted the Campus Police"and
City Police concerning specific
problems outside the Annex and
had been ignored. “Nobody gives
a damn about us," Casciato said.

Stickler complained that the
Annex was being utilized for “the
activities which tend to be the most
objectionable to the residents. And
it is the one University facility
closest to the residential areas.”
He stressed that ODI was equally
concerned with problems centering
around other Oakland buildings.
“We are definitely not picking on
you because you are students,”
Stickler told SGB. _ '

SGB member Paul Hertneky
asked Stickler if ODI would be
willing to draw "up their idea of
what the Annex should be used for
in cooperation with the students.
“The Student Government Board
represents a large number of
students and the University listens
to what we say. If we could reach a
concensus of opinion and present it
to the University, and say we have
found it to be reasonable and
acceptable, I’ll wager ‘that the
University will fmdiit to be reason-

 

able and acceptable,” Hertneky
said.

Furick suggested City Police-
should be hired to patrol outside ‘of
the Annex during concerts and a
list should be presented to ODI of
scheduled activities for their ap-
proval.

Casciato argued that the problem
was not primarily what was held
within the building,‘but what went
on outside. “The students can plan

a program with a guitarist and ~

expect 50 to 60 students to attend,
but when the word gets out that
there is a guitarist at the Annex,
you've got 400 to 500 people
around there,” he said;

“These programs bring in a bad
element from all over Pittsburgh
trying to get in," Casciato said.
“There are many things you can
hold down there, but there are a
few you can’t for those reasons."

SGB President Furick suggested
alleviation of the problem stated by
Casciato through the selling of
tickets prior to programs at the
Student Union ticket office and
stationing police outside of the
Annex to “move away anyone
without a ticket." -

ODI members asked Furick to also
deal with the problem of illegally
parked cars during concerts and
the “loud music.”

The board will discuss the contro-
versy and guidelines at their regu-
lar Wednesday meeting (8 pm. 305
SUB).

Mark Kornfeld, Negotiations

dent Government efforts to reopen the Student Union Annex by
iating with the Oakland Development Incorporated (ODI) are a
_ e of energy due to the Oakland community’s unwillingness toseek
utions and resolve the issue with clear, thoughtful, and open minds.
At a meeting held nearly two weeks ago Dan Stickler, chairman of the
block committee responsible for the Bouquet Street area,
  . ' ed the oomplaintss of the community saying, “We can't
"if i ate what goes on inside the Annex any longer.”
complaints against the Annex are concerned with its internal
,andasGtyCouncilmanBillCoynepointedout.atthesame

r 0 the building. .
yne correctly identiﬁed the problem when he said, “With a little
__ re. policing outside the building or in Oakland in general, I think we
" solve the problems.”
ce Chancellor of Public Affairs Bernard Kobosky invited ODI
representatives to attend a meeting at Pitt to reach a compromise
ion in order to maintain the Aimex’s operations in its present,
 priate and necessary capacity.
” t, rejecting the notion of compromise, ODI representatives brought
ure to bear on the Department of Public Safety, which ordered the
restrictions on the Annex’s use. City Planning Director Robert
rnoster consideredthe cause of the problem to be only a “lack of
nmmnication between students and the Oakland community.”
, The real problem, though, is the political power of the ODI.
_ ’ rding to the Occupancy Permit approved by the City of Pittsburgh,
Annex could be used for “offices and related hall.” And,
V-aternoster says this outlaws any sort of large entertainment programs
the facility.
Paternoster fails to say, however, is that the Occupancy Permit
as so general it could have been construed as permitting those
"grains, which have been presented at the Annex since last January.
And he also ignores the fact that large entertainment programs are not
resented at the Aimex, since only small scale entertainment, such as
f_ffeehouses, attracting a maximum of 189 people, have been featured
tf-the Annex. ' .' _
Paternoster and the Oakland community have also ignored that Pitt
 ‘  ' trators willingly initiated steps to resolve the complaints of
 residents. Two city policemen were to patrol the area outside
’‘ -Annex and two campus policemen were to regulate the activity
ide the facility.
we have said before and are compelled to say once again, the
‘iniversity and Pitt students are not responsible for the crime situation
mr Oakland which after all, is the essence of this problem.
But, at this point the issue can not be resolved‘ by negotiations
een Pitt students and the Oakland community. A city agency
. to the political pressure of a community group and making an
arbitrary decision to restrict uses of a University facility is now involved
and must be dealt with by those attempting to resolve the problem.

‘It is time that Student Government remind Coimcilman Coyne of his
‘Lwnrwords, and force the other members of the City Council to become
are of this arbitrary use of power by the executive branch of city
‘overnment. And by doing this Student Government also would bring
tlieissue to the attention of all city residents in an effort not to hide the
real problems of the Oakland community, but rather to seek
reasonable solutions, which will beneﬁt all those who live and work in
 the Oakland Development Incorporated will not recognize the
problem in their own neighborhood, then, it is encumbent that elected
city representatives rise above the pettiness and insincerity of their
own constituents, and seek solutions to problems of_ crime in Oakland.

A Addendum 

l1€5U Annex ISSUUEAE A New Allocations System

 

BY TOM SMITH .
Editor’s Note: [This is the fifth
and last in a series of articles on the
Student Government Allocations
Committee.] -

Student Government (SG) Presi-
dent Mike Furick has listed as a
priority of the last months of his
administration a study of the
allocations process. However, un-
less drastic changes in that system
are made the Student Government
Board (SGB) will never be capable
of effectively conducting its busi-
ness as the elected representative
body of Pitt undergraduates.

In addition to studying the
mechanical processes of allocating
the funds collected from the
Activities Fee, the status of the fee
itself must be examined.

One or two years ago the $300,000
collected from the Activities Fee
was a substantial amount of money
to allocate to student organizations.
But, the number of organizations
has increased along with the rate of
inﬂation, depleting the amount of

‘ money available, and also making

the financial impact of the
Activities Fee revenue minimal.

If Student Government is to
continue to provide the maximum
services possibleto students, then,
it must either increase the activities
fee from its present rate of $12 per
term,or be more selective in
allocating the available funds.

The high costs of education which
students already bear make an
increase of the activities fee a
burdensome suggestion. And quite
clearly a greater selectivity in
appropriating funds should allevi-
ate the funding difﬁcultiesg of
Student Government.

Upon their election in January the
SGB should establish specific
funding priorities. The Furick
Board moved in this direction last
winter by establishing general
priorities, which were eventually
ignored by the Allocations Com--

 

 

mittee.

The establishment of speciﬁc
priorities would consist of selecting
those services most beneﬁcial to
the majority of the student body.
Essentially, this would mean
student organizations with only
minimal membership and limited
appeal would not be eligible for
funding from SG, even though
those organizations could still be
recognized by Student Govern-
merit.

An acute deﬁciency in the present
allocations process is that too much
authority is vested in an unelected
and unrepresentative body. The
Student Government Board should
be more involved in the allocations
process and have more authority
than merely either accepting or
rejecting a budget recommendation
from the Allocations Committee.

For Student Government to

‘function effectively,‘ though, it

must finalize all funding requests
as soon as possible, in order that
the members of the SGB can begin
concentrating their effoi/'ts on other
more important student_concems.

For example, the Furick Board
has just begun work on an
evaluation of a teaching project
similar to the Undergraduate
Academic Review. Had allocations
been finished last winter, however,
the SGB could have begun work on
this project during the spring term.

Student Government should set a
deadline for submitting all budget
requests by February 1 and ﬁnalize
all allocations by April. This would
give the Board time to survey the
budgets and establish funding
priorities. This could be done. in
conjunction with the Allocations
Committee at a public meeting with
representatives from all student
organizations.

It would, then, be the responsibil-
ity of the Student Government
Board to make specific figure
allocation recommendations .for

Project I ndepen.dence

 

each student organization in
consonance with the funding
priorities it establishes.

The Allocations Committee would
conduct interviews with each
student organization as a systema-
tic check on the Student Govern-
ment Board. Yet, the committee
would conduct these interviews
with the understanding that the
Board recommendation would only
be altered if it was clearly without
propriety. ,

Once allocations are ﬁnalized in
April no organization could apply
for emergency funding requests,
and the role of the Allocations
Committee could also change. The
members of the Allocations Com-
mittee could assume the role of
SGB advisors assisting Board
members in their work. '

This would be very similar to the
executive bureaucracy proposed by
former SG President Rege Kauf-
man, only without all that system’s
drawbacks. This would not create a
set of new bureaus of Student
Government, but rather utilize one
which had finished its primary
function.

Space limitations make it impos-
sible to suggest remedies for all
problems with the current outdated
allocations system. However, these

suggestions can provide a basis of

change for Student Government
when it begins its allocations study.
And those conclusions will hope-
fully resolve many of the issues
raised in this series.

Will the Student Government
Board have more authority in the
allocations process? Will more
students beneﬁt from the tax they
pay in the form, of the Activities
Fee? Or will Student Government’s
examination of the allocations
process be only a reevaluation of
funding guidelines and not really
an examination of the mechanical
processes of allocating money?

Solving the Oxygen Shortage

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Among the problems facing our
nation today, the greatest may well
be the oxygen shortage. President
Ford has not been slow to move on
the matter, and a recent act of
Congress had created a Federal
Ofﬁcc of Respiration (FOR) to solve
the problem.

As part of an overall "Project
Independence" FOR has imple-
mented a three-point plan to make
America oxygen-independent by
the year 2000.

Paramount is a movement to make
Americans more aware of the
problem of oxygen shortage
through education. The oxygen-
producing countries in South
America and Africa have banded
together against larger nations,
and are threatening a selective
boycott of nations who don’t
knuckle under. I

This means the price of breathing
will go up, and we must all cutback
on the amount of oxygen we
consume each day.

Here are some pointers on how
you can save our nation's most
pl‘€Cl0l,lS natural resource:

l[. Cut down: Is that extra breath
.neces'sary'? Try holding your breath
until you get dizzy. ‘Then take
another one. This way, according to

FOR statistics, Americans can save .

‘nearly. seven million liters .' of

 

 

oxygen a day.

2[. Cut back: Heart-lung machine
owners can set their dials back to
the “coma" level and still maintain
a reasonable amount of conscious-
ness.

3[. Form breathing pools: How
many times a day do you ﬁnd
yourselfin a room, breathing all by
yourself? Set up a breathing pool
with people you work with, ‘go to

‘school with and play with. Its a

great way to get to know_just who
lives next door, and what they ate
for lunch. ’

4l. Hermetically seal doors and
windows: Leaving your windows
open to every breeze and draft
saturates your home with wasted
oxygen. Silicon putty or friction
tape is great for this sort of thing.

5[. Pets and children: These cute
little characters burn up more
oxygen in one hour than you use all
day. Try saving one of those big
plastic bags from the cleaners. A
pair of scissors and string converts
them into nifty little bags which
you can secure around their cute
little heads. They will then use the
same air for hours! Of course they
will whine and complain, but once
the bag is on. they'll complain less
and less and less.

61. Sleep: We breathe less when
we’re asleep, or watching televis-
ion, so try -nodding off at least ,' 15

. licans.

hours a day, or watching Apple’s
Way. When you do go to bed, try
putting the pillow over your face,
you’ll waste less precious oxygen.

7[. Talking: Federal Office of
Respiration has determined that
remarks critical of government
policy use five times as much
precious oxygen as regular conver-
sations! Next time some anarchist
liberal know-nothing opens his fat
lips, punch him in the throat.

8[. Euthanasia: Is your mothcr-in-
law living at home? Survey results
‘show that slipping a little cyanide
into tea consumed by people over
65 cuts their oxygen consumption
to practically nothing! We're sure

your elderly relatives wouldn’t
mind doing their part to use oxygen
wisely.

These are just a few of the
thousands of suggestions pub-
lished by the Federal Office of
Respiration in a handbook entitled
“How to Cut Back on Oxygen
Consumption and Save Our Nation
from a Fate Worse than Death:
What You can Do."

Just pick up your copy at the Post
Ofﬁce.

If everyone pitches in and tightens
the old belta couple of notches, we
will have oxygen enough for just
about everyone, especially Repub-

would provide for his many

A wrinkled’ old construction
worker, chewing his Mail Pouch
vigorously as he worked at the site
of "Pitt’s new Law Building,
summed up what is probably the
outlook of most chewers. “It‘s a
habit...but I love it.” When asked
why most young people aren’t

chewing, the man (who wished to
withhold his name) said, (“they

he laughed I noticed the gentleman

But don’t be misled. According to
four out of ﬁve dentists picked
randomly from the phonebook.
tobacco chewing has about the
same effects on the teeth as
smoking cigarettes and chewing
gum. Of the four dentists who
replied (the ﬁfth had no comment
since he had passed away since the
last edition of the yellow pages was
put out), all of them were
convinced that teeth were stained
no worse by chewing than by
smoking. As for wearing down the
teeth, Dr. "George Kessel, a
dentist in the Jenkins Arcade,

Chewing tobacco 1S as easy to do

you venture into the tobacco shop

sweeter tobacco).

You shouldn't have done that. The _

cause you to experience all of the

nausea. Now you understand why I

But don’t give up now. It was
proven in a study entitled “The

chewing several times, these bad
side effects will gradually disap-

light-headedness), and in a week or

Now that you know how enjoyable
chewing is, you’re probably con-

that’s all taken care of, too. Mike

Jfennsy/vania's Two GOP9Senafor$ Speck Ou

Schweiker:“I think we need some very radical surgery in terms of ‘our
economic policy. But the real question is—how many changes are we

really willing to make?”

BY SCOTT MACLEOD _

WASHINGTON--Watergate is
behind us, so proclaim the voters.
When asked what campaign evokes
their most passionate concern, and
which factor will sway their minds
to vote either Republican or Demo-
cratic this year, ‘the voters answer
emphatically--inflation, the bread
and butter iss'ue! ,«

 

And Pennsylvania’s two GOP.

Senator-sl know it, Both Hugh Scott
and Richard Schweiker seem ready
to forget Watergate, and plunge
mifull steam ahead into alleviating
— the nation’s economic woes. '

“Personally, I’m happy to see the i

open door of the Ford administra-

tion on this issue,” Schweiker said. ,

“This attitude is a strong depart-
ure from the Nixon administration.
Before you solve any problem
you’ve got to communicate. For six
years we’ve had just the opposite

‘around here.”

But Scott, Per_1nsylvania’s senior
Senator and Senate Minority Lead-
er warns:
miracles. The country’s economic
problems will‘ not be solved over-

 night; they will not be solved ina
 year. .But they can be reduced
’ gradually with discipline‘ and sacri-

fice until things are under control.”

Admitting the economic situation
was not being handled very well
right now, Scott was quick to
criticize his political counterparts--
the Democrats. ’

“I think when people blame the
Republican Party for inﬂation, they
generally mean that the Democrats
vote more money to them. But now
we have over $100 billion in war
debts, and $120 billion in borrowed

,' money taken out of the private
market. ’This ' has led to a
. __,«4.~§reduction in capital flow and higher

‘interest rates. And. the fault of this I;

is largely inthe hands of the people
who voted "the money—-the - Demo-
cratic majority. Not a ‘penny gets

 

“There‘ will be no,

\

voters pretend not to blame them
because they give them the money
that makes them feelisoi good.”
Aside from this attitude, Scott
says, the Republican Party is

. plagued because the presidency is
in Republican hands,‘ at a‘ time-
when the nation is facing a serious.‘

crisis. Scott indicated that people"
tend toicorrelate "the nation’s ills

good or bad with the. White House.‘ ‘

“People will go right on voting for
the people who would spend them

. right out of existence,” Scott said.

“It feels so good to be a, Democrat;
it feels good to. say ‘I am for the
people.’
cannot giveipeople what they want.

Sometimes you need discipline. So ’
_ I can’t give people what they want

sometimes. And because of it, I
have to take the rap.” _
Schweiker, who likes to refer to
himself as a “progressive liberal,”
end in the aftermath of Watergate,
almost brags about the fact that he
had voted to override all 14 of
former President Nixon's vetoes on
legislation passed by the Congress:

Ultimately,‘ he scored points for‘, _

I‘

his self-proclaimed image as a—

man of independent judgment,”

/when he was named on the White
House Enemies List, and when he-

subsequently called for Nixon’s
resignation. Undaunted by Water-
gate, Schweiker, who is running for
re-election this year against Pitts-
burgh's Mayor Pete Flaherty, pre-
fers dealing with economic prob-
lems. .

“The proof‘ of the pudding is in
the eating,” he says comically
about a solution to the nation’s
economic ills.
some very radical surgery in terms
of our economic policy. I don't
think the policies which have been
followed for the past 20 or 25 years
are valid anymore. But the real
question is--how many changes are
we really willing to make?

gish economy, but aid those im-
mediately who are most directly
affected by it, Ford suggested a tax
relief program for persons in the
lower income bracket, and a tax
surcharge on families with an
income of more than $15,000.

“How highishould you go on this
surcharge?” Schweiker asked.
“You take $15,000. Now to me,
that is not in the high income
bracket. In\fact that is the average
American's tax.bracket. I don't
know, I'll haveto take a long hard

' look at the surcharge.”

Schweiker has already introduced
legislation for a two tier credit
system, which would provide low
cost ‘credit for a level of high
priority economic activity--such as
housing--and another steeper cost
credit for lower priority activity.

“It seems to me that if somebody
wants. to build a swimming pool, or
a gambling casino, then they ought
to fight the tight interest rates,” he
said. — 

As do most legislators on Capitol
Hill, Schweiker and Scott also

endorse the President’s proposal
for public service employment.

“So to the extent that the Presi-
dent is coming up, with proposals
-such as these, I think the impact

_has a good chance of being

Vmeaningful,” Schweiker added.
-“Butif it's going to be the same old
tight money approach, that's not

« ' going to be enough.”

But a tight budget is also part of
Ford’s program,‘ and it is a part

Scott thoroughly enjoys. In fact, if .

the Senate Minority Leader had his
» way, the budget would be stripped
even more.

..f§‘-Although we may have a budget
of $305 billion, only about $100
billion is ﬂexible. i So I would
advocate ;a budget cut of at least
what the President asks for in the
areas of defense and services,”
Scott said. "

‘Both Scott and Schweiker are
against the proposed $.10 gasoline
tax. “Such taxes would fall most
harshly on those‘ who can least

-afford to pay them,” Scott said.
“Some 79% of Americans use
automobiles in their,b_usiness or to
get to work, and this kind of a tax
_would increase‘ their living costs
insupportably.”

Schweiker agreed with Scott and

was hard on the oil producers.
~ “The oil producing countries are
strangling us economically. I_ think
it’s time we got as tough with them
as they are with us, including
international development loan
funding and military sales. What-

‘ever we have to do.” ' ‘

‘ ‘Secondly, " ~'Schweiker added,
“We have to get unhooked from
thecar. We must launch a gigantic
research project, whether it would
mean converting ‘sea water into
hydrogen or developing a battery
operated car. We have to show the
Arabs that the gas monopoly can be
broken.

Schweiker, a one term Senator, is
convinced that not only inflation,
but Watergate, will be an issue in
this years’ congressional elections.
V Because of President Ford's par-
don to the former
Schweiker believes that Watergate
is still around to haunt Republican
candidates. ~

, “Sure the party is in,for tough
times,” Schweiker said. “Of
. jcourse, alot is, going to depend on

 
  
   
 

ah d’ofhim-

pardon.” _
Schweiker continued: “To deter-
mine the damage, you’ll have to
examine the cases of individual
candidates. I think in my case, it
reminds people that I was a Senator
who called for the president's
(Nixon) resignation, that I stood up
against Haynesworth and Carswell,
and that I condemned the pardon.
So I- think it has just reinforced my

"Schweiker, who like the former

Senator's pesonal Washington of-

politics.

"One way we can restore this lost

theorized. “This is the only way
that we can get rid of the special

“As in President Nixon’s case, I
think the proper .place for this
matter is in the courts,” Schweiker
said. ‘‘If you want the courts to
work, you have to follow the rule of
law. I realize there are a lot of war
resisters with very sincere feelings,

this matter in the courts.”

Would it damage him politically if
he were to come out in favor of a
blanket amnesty?

"I really don't know about the

are deeply aroused--the activist

The boundaries between pretense

liscured in Luigi Pirandello's Six
liaracters in Search of an Author.
The Playhouse Performing Arts
enter has chosen this aspect of
'randello’s complex work as the
.,. éntral image in its production of
 ix Characters. which was directed
y_James Prescott.
A-company of actors is preparing
 "rehearse a. new comedy by
Pirandello, whom they criticize
penly. Six ghostly figures dressed p
Ehlack appear on stage. They
laim to be characters in a play in
hich the author has lost interest.

What follows is a story of violent
motional impact. The drama-
i/thin-the-drama concerns the
oinplex relationships between ,a’
an (John Danielich), his wife
Marilynn Mollica), his son (Ed-
M und Wojcik), and step-daughter
_i-“(Eileen Lynch). Because they are
aonly creations of the author’s mind,
their fates are sealed beforehand
land they are aware of their
iéevitable destinies.

;will not be able to duplicate their
" tensity. In this way, the play sets

'-too impotent to imitate life in an

 characters. ’
1 In ‘Six Characters, the stage
becomes an arena for conflicting
«iideas. Pirandello’s is a cerebral
‘theatre, where much of the action
takes place in the viewer’s head.
here are disturbing comments
made on truth in art. The manager
"refuses to stage a certain scene in
[the characters’ lives because she
fears it will upset the audience.
._ The play is a reaction to this
‘truth-to-a-certain-extent attitude.

It also rebels against the declama-

Thoughts
at Small

, BY JESS MIBRALLIER
ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT EDITOR

 

A magazine review. Why not‘? .

I read Newsweek regularly (doesn't everybody?) and it’s decent. It
serves its purpose: weekly news, hell raising-, getting rid of Nixon, and

' covering the paper clip shortage. Not to mention its unique ability of
enabling average Americans to sense the satisfaction of common
knowledge. It's decent.

But let’s never permit the world to forget the issue of July 1, 1974. For.
quick identification, hotdog Bjorn Borg, looking supposedly cute and
handsome is on the cover. Borg is the issue’s one major flaw, after all
no male, all of which fart, burp and have diarrhea, deserves to be loved
so much by such a'high percentage of the world’s female population.

The ‘beauty and ultimate attractiveness of the July 1 issue lies in its
coverage of scandals. Everybody loves a scandal, not a murder or a
hardened criminal torturing crippled puppies, but a scandal, one
human being ripping off another in a unique, interesting manner.
Rip-off doesn't necessarily imply money, but also embarrassment,
false love, and the destruction of treasured values.

There's really nothing better than a» good religious scandal, they’re
common, amusing and quite human. After all, religion itself is

_ probably the longest, most consistent ‘and greatest scandal ever told.
Newsweek’s religious scandal dealt with the death of Jean _Cardinal
Danielou, who was known for his defense of such concepts as papal
infallibility and priestly celibacy. On May 20,’ Danielou, often known as
Mr. Morality, died in the arms of Mimi Santoni, “a peroxide-blond
stripper and part-time prostitute whom Danielou had been visiting
once a week, for about three months.” (Her husband is in jail on
pimping charges). _

The French weekly, Le Canard Enchaine summed‘up the entire
situation in this manner. “We would not find it at all scandalous if he
had died in the arms of the pretty Mimi, for in our view that would have
‘been a fine death.” Scandals are so great. " _ ' A

Enough ofgreligious scandals, I’ve been damned too often." ,

Newsweek also ran a scandal in the same issue that might be close to
classic... the Mel Greenberg scandal. It seems that Mel drove into
Lexington, Virginia and claimed to be a Hollywood advance man for an
epic Civil War movie. Despite his large paunch, balding dome and
altogether unsteller appearance, (a bit like John Mitchell‘, except that

_the silly hat was missing), “he just seemed to have that Hollywood
flair,” according to his innkeeper, Norman Anderson. - '

Supposedly the film was to star Audrey Hepburn and Burt Lancaster
with Lexington residents as extras. The auditions? Young, buxom girls
‘were required to walk nude across Greenberg’s motel room and then
‘hold a pose while he offered director’s comments. One resident,
probably labeled as nuts, didn’t trust Mel. So be searched around a bit
and found" out that Mel"s Hollywood address was a parking lot...the
townspeople ignored him. Not too long after running out on Lexington
without paying a cent, Mel was picked up in Hillsboro, Ohio posing as a
scout for a Rock Hudson film. What a great guy. Anyway, he was
finally charged for defrauding an innkeeper, even though it turned out
that innkeeper Anderson took in over $2,500 from people waiting for
auditions. '

The Greenberg (scandal was so popular and Mel was so liked for his
efforts, that several people formed a _“Free Mel Greenberg
Committee.” These people are the true lovers of a good scandal, and I
can only praise them for their admiration of Mr. Greenberg.

The July 1,issue also created its own scandal by printing joke postage

stamps commemorating the _Watergate _ affair. Next week, the
magazine reported that several readers then successfully used the joke
stamps to mailletters to sweethearts, Newsweek, and Nixon.
' Newsweek didn’t stop with the stamps though, for they then went
ahead and published three of the silliest pictures ever, of Nixon, the
two _best being photos of him with goofy expressions and equally goofy
hats. It was perfect. After all, if it wasn’t for the tasteless, disgusting
manner in which Nixon operates, _he might very well have been
America’s greatest “Mr. Scandal.”

Not to be outdone ever, Newsweek also ran an article on National
Lampoon, the cruelest, most ruthless scandal magazine of all, a photo
of Paul Getty minus ear, and a photo of a- wrinkled Sam Ervin kissing
his equally prune-like wife, Margaret;

I can only suggest that if you find yourself bored and losing faith in
the American dream system, take a look at Newsweek, July 1, 1974.
It’s a treasured collection of scandals...and everybody loves a good
‘scandal. After all, it’s more American than mother’s poisoned apple
pie.

BY JIM OP-PENHEIMER

The weekend of October 6th, the
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra
performed Gustaf Mahler’s Sym-
phony No. 2 (“Resurrection”)
under the direction of Claudio
Abbado, the musical director of
Theatro La Scala, Italy. Assisting in
the performances were Evelyn
Mandac, soprano, Birgit Fin_nila-,
mezzo-soprano, and the Mendel-
sohn Choir of Pittsburgh.

The symphony--the only work on
the program--is written in five
movements. The first tends to be
rather dull, due mostly to excessive
length, and is a bit choppy, having
some sudden changes in style,
starts and stops, which were a bit
annoying to _this writer. The main

fault, however, is that it is simply

too long. _ _

The second movement is a
somewhat charming treatment of
an Austrian dance form, -the
Laendler. Mahler shows his solid
knowledge of orchestration here in
his varied treatment of the simple
dance motifs. ~

The third movement is a
“symphonic poem" treatment of
material borrowed from another
Mahler work,‘ “Des Knaben

iWunderhorn. "

The fourth movement features a"
lovely solo by the mezzo. The
approach of Mahlerto the subject
of resurrection and the last
judgment is expressed here for

the first time. The text speaks of a
soul which comes heavenward, to
be rejected by an angel. The soul,
however, insists on its assurance of
salvation (“The clear God will give
me a little light,/ Will light my way
to the eternal, blessed life!"), and
this theme sets the tone for the
ﬁnal movement.

The choir becomes active for the
first time in the last movement, and
it doesn’t actually have anything to
do for a considerable time. The text
for choir and soloists comes from a
poem by Gottlieb Friedrich Klop-
stock, a German poet of the same
period of. time as Goethe.

After an overlong development,
and a passage devised, according
to Mahler, to simulate the march of
all people toward the final
judgment, the surprise message is
intoned by a capella choir: "Rise
again, yea, rise again shalt thou,
my dust, after a short rest!” And
later: “What has come~-to pass
must pass away; what has passed
away shall come again! Don’t
tremble! Prepare thyself -- prepare
thyself to live!" After such a long
buildup to the finale, it seems to be
over before it's really begun, and
the ﬁnale is the high point of the
whole work. Mahler gives clear
indication of the style he will later
use so successfully in his “Sym-
phony of a Thousand," the Eighth
Symphony. ,

This writer came away less than

something new to some readers. I
would appreciate comments, sug-
gested albums, and recommenda-
tions for improvements of my
writing subjects.

The french horn ensemble plays a
big role in each of the albums

‘chosen for review today.

The first album features Robert
Schumann's “Concert Piece for
Four Horns and Orchestra,” and
“Concert Piece for Piano and
Orchestra in G Major,” performed
by the Chamber Orchestra of the
Sarre, under Karl Ristenpart
(Nonesuch H-71044). The piano
piece is not that bad in itself, but
the real reason to buy this record is
the horn piece.

At the time Schtimann wrote the
work, the rotory valve had only
recently been added to the horn,
giving the instrument the ability to
play a full scale in any key. He

wrote this work to show off the new

capabilities of the horn. Unfortun-
ately, he didn’t have a full
understanding of all the complex-
ities involved in writing for the
horn, so the four horn parts are
very difficult to perform without
making many mistakes, and that is
why this piece is seldom recorded
and almost never performed. This
recording does away with most of
thioseproblems by editing.

This music is some of the most
energetic, jubilant stuff this writer
has heard. The conﬁdent,dissonan-

ces of the horns, with their
insistent, galloping melodic lines,
suggest four wild stallions running
free as the wind. The joyfully
exuberant nature of this piece
makes it‘ a good addition to
anyone’s library.

The linernotes read, in part, “Not
until Richard Strauss was the horn
again used with such extravagant
emotion.” -

This leads us to the second album,
which features three pieces by
Richard Strauss; “Death and

1-ClCtSSlCCtl Music Lover Vs. Economicsot “Pop" L

Transfiguration," “Dance of the
Seven Veils,” from Strauss’ opera,
Salome, and “Dance Suite After
Couperin.” They are performed by

_the Philharmonia Orchestra, under

Artur Rodzinski (Seraphim
S-60030).
Strauss, best known in some

circles for the opening to his superb
tone poem “Also Sprach Zarathus-
tra (Thus Spoke Zoroaster‘),” was a
very skillful and liberal user of the
horn ensemble.

Heller's Second /vlonsterlength

(Continued from Page 9)

ball, rope-climbing, nausea, men-

acing men, and public speaking all

have to be there for him to contend

with..."

He tells about another child that

he seldom considers his own: “It is
. not true that retarded (brain-dam-
aged, idiot, feeble-minded, emo-
-tionally disturbed, autistic) child-
ren are the necessary favorites of.
their parents or that they are
always uncommonly beautiful and
lovable, for Derek,- our youngest
child, is not especially good-l_ook-
ing, and we do not love him at all.”

Slocum tells and tells and tells and
tells. But nothing happens. He is
boring“ to say the least. His 569
page monologue is typical‘~of the
kind heard at urban bus stops and
small town bars: too long, too

rambling, and ultimately point-
less.
But pointlessness is Heller's

point. This is Western man in the
late 20th century. In Slocum’s
words: “We make money and have
fun. We read books and go to
plays. And somehow time pass-
es.” We've reached a sorry state,
says Heller. We’ve gone off the
track. Somehow something hap-
pened.
Heller doesn’t put his finger on it.

Maybe he doesn’t know himself
what happened. Whatever it was
_doesn’t matter. What really mat-
ters is what’s hapening to us now.

  

And Heller spatters the blood and
guts of it on every page to
challenge the reader. Do you admit
this is really the way it is?‘ Have
you seen too much of it to be
affected? ls the tragic irony of Bob
Slocum and Family and Company
sheer boredom for you? Be honest.
It was for me.

If we choose to sleep through life
under the gaze of the golden calf of
inanity, then something cataclys-

mically fatal will befall mankind.
Something will happen. Heller
doesn't say what. ~

Heller intends for you to sleep
through his novel. That’s the shock
of it. That you’ve fallen asleep
while all this was going on. The
crucial point in the book comes
when you close it. Fall asleep then,
and it’s the same as death if you

refuse to wake up.

Tonight in Student Union

   

 

,,_ Pitt Sponsors Blues Concert

  

‘ .

The duo’ of Sonny Terry and
Brownie McGhee plus Norman
Blake, are the current attractions at
the Annex, or whoops, rather the
Student Union lower lounge. The
two shows last night will be

. followed by performances at 8 and
10:30 tonight.

Terry and McGhee have been
labeled “the greatest living expo-
nents of Black Folk Blues” by the
New York Times. Terry, who plays
harmonica and McGhee who plays
guitar joined forces in 1950.
Separately and together, they have

_ recorded over 70 albums, written

movie scores and toured in North
America, Europe" and Australia.

A review of one of their concerts
said “Sonny and Brownie were the
real thing. You’d hear them on the
old records of Woody Guthrie and
Leadbelly...The songs that they
play are familiar. Some of them
they've been doing for years,

H probably because there’s still no

one who can do them better.
Kansas City, John Henry, Mid-
night Special...their versions are
the most genuine, most soulful
ones going.”

If you ‘read your album jackets

’ carefully, you’ll probably recognize

the name of Norman Blake. Blake
has been a backup musician for
contemporaries such as John Hart-
ford, Bob Dylan, Kris Kris'toffer-
son, David Bromberg and Joan
Baez. He’s also played with
country and bluegrass performers
like Johnny Cash, June Carter and
Doc Watson.

Blake is a serious quiet man

L behind his mustache and wire-rim-

med glasses. He is bluegrass born
and bred, in northern Georgia; he
is scuffed-up hiking boots, and
weathered worn-down 1935 Martin
D 28 herringbone guitar. Blake
plays mandolin, and fiddle as well,
and has a “boy-next-door voice.”
Blake, who performs with Grant
Boatwright accompanying him on
guitar has one album of his own.
He comments “People were...say-
ing they had seen my name on this
and‘ the other album, and telling
me how great I was, and I realized

Norman Blake: “I usually get fairly moody before I write a song...I_
want to be involved in the songs in some way.”

these people hadnever really heard
me play. They had only heard me

backing up somebody in a style that ‘

I was unaccustomed to. In other

words they had heard me play my
worst.” Now you can hear Blake
play bluegrass his way at the lower
lounge. V

Horns Key to Schumann's

(Continued from Page 12)

The tone poem, “Death and
Transﬁguration,” is one of his
early works (opus 24), and is a very
clear tone-painting of the impres-
sions of an old man on his
deathbed, his struggle against
death, his reﬂections on his past
life, and finally, his death and
“transﬁguration” into something"
more...immortality? Because the
general intentions of Strauss’

.<L

 

presents

music are usually quite clear, his
music is quite popular with many.
“The Dance of the Seven Veils” is
the music for the scene in Salome
where Salome dances before her
father, and entices him to give her
the head of John the Baptist on a
platter. Very seductive music.

“The Dance Suite after Couper-

in’ shows a different side of

Strauss. Here is the sixty-year—old
master adding his fantastic orches-

 

 

(Continued from Page 

where experimental and classic
movies are screened for classroom
use and then shown free to the
general student body to ‘give them
an opportunity to see these pic-
tures.

E “The idea of starting the program
here was given by Dr. Bruce
Goldstein, a psychology professor,
who uses experimental films in his
courses,” said Majernik.

“Another purpose of the screen-
ings,” he added, “is to provide
those interested in film studies a
forum and meeting place for hold-
ing discussion.” ' 8

The schedule is irregular with
screenings on Monday and Thurs-
day held in room G-8 of the
Cathedral, on Tuesdays in Room
327 in the Cathedral and on
Wednesdays in room 239 of the
Cathedral. All showings begin at 8

.pm and will last about two hours.

The rest of the October schedule
includes Blue and Eisenstein’s

Potemkin October 14, Throne of

Blood October 16, Marlon Brando

in The Wild One October 21,
Anemic Cinema and Luv October
23, James Dean in East of Eden
October 28, Uberfall, La Chute de
la Maison Usher and Alphaville
October 29 and Beggars Opera
October 30.

Pieces

tration abilities to the ‘harpsichord
dance music of Francois Couperin.
Using a small orchestra, adding
celeste and harpsichord, Strauss
enhances the delicate, fragile
beauty of these pieces, originally
written for harpsichord, from two
centuries before. This is‘ a
delightful little gem, and, along
with the tone poem, makes this
record a welcome addition to
anyone’s collection. And the price
is right.

Pirate Homers Help Kison “Whip” LA

RICHIE HEBNER, the Pirate’s slugging third baseman, blasted a
three run homer yesterday in Pittsburgh’s 7-0 rout of the Dodgers. The
Bucs narrowed L.A.’s series lead  two games to one. Photo by

AP Sports Writer

Los ANGELES—-Pittsburgh’s

.batting power exploded with ﬁrst

inning home runs by Willie Stargell
and Richie Hebner that propelled
the Pirates to a 7-0 victory over the
Los Angeles Dodgers Tuesday and
kept them alive in the National
League playoff.

The victory left the Dodgers
holding a 2-1 advantage in the best
of ﬁve series, which continues
Wednesday in Los Angeles.

Pittsburgh’s vaunted bats were
silenced without an extra base hit
in the first two games, but the
Pirates made some loud noises
Tuesday, bombing left hander
Doug Rau off the mound in the
opening inning. -

Both Stargell’s three run homer
and Hebner's two run blast wound
up in the left ﬁeld pavilion, about
390 feet from home plate and gave
the Pirates a quick 5-0 lead.

The Pirates added two more runs
in the third. Hebner knocked in
one of them. before the Dodgers
collected their first hit off right
hander Bruce Kison on an inﬁeld
grounder by shortstop Bill Russell

in the bottom of the third.

They got only one more hit off the
6 foot 4 hurler--a line drive single to
center by Russell in the seventh.
_When Kison began losing his
sharpness in the seventh, he was
relieved by southpaw Ramon

- Hernandez, who gave up two more

,hits in completing the shutout.

A crowd of 55,953, a record for the
baseball playoffs and also for
Dodger Stadium, watched under
skies that remained leaden most of
the afternoon even though the
threat of rain faded.

The Dodgers struggled on offense
and went to pieces in the ﬁeld,
committing ﬁve errors, the most
ever in a playoff game.

If Pitt ever needed such a perfor-
mance, they need it now. The team

four games and have not been able
to play ball control football. espec-
ially in the past two weeks.

“We've had a very difficult time
getting our defense off the field in
the last two games,” said Majors.
“We haven’t got the ball to our
offensive team in good field posi-

tion in the last two weeks so they.

haven‘t been able to move the ball.
We have not turned things around
defensively and that will be a big
factor in this game and throughout
the rest of the season.

“We were tired, and we were not
crisp,“ continued Majors. “We
weren't gang tackling and we
missed some tackles. We missed
Mike Bulino but it was more that
just missing one man. We lost the
game as a team."

Although he admitted there was
still much work to do. Majors was
pleased with the offense's showing
in Saturday's game. The offense
scored 29 points against North
Carolina despite an ankle injury to
Tony Dorsett which slowed him
down considerably.

“We did move the ball last
week," said Majors. Pat Gleieh,

right tackle, and Tom Brozoza, who
started at right guard, did give us
some impact offensively. Dave

PITTSBURGH AP - After four
weeks on the bench, Terry
Bradshaw may be about to take the
reins of the Pittsburgh Steelers
again.

Steelers Coach Chuck Noll says he
‘doesn't know who will start
Sunday’s game in Kansas City.
That’s a switch from last week
when he unhesitatingly backed Joe
Gilliam despite a disastrous per-
formance in a 17-0 loss to Oakland.

But Sunday’s lacklustre 13-7

‘ ‘{"'_;squeaker over dull Houston may

i have cost Gilliam his job.

“We will not make a decision
on our quarterback until late in the
week,” Noll said. “We have to
utilize all of our personnel more
thanwe have been doing.”

Gilliam led the Steelers to a
perfect 6-0 exhibition game record
and replaced Terry Bradshaw as
starting signal caller, throwing
passes where Noll would have
preferred to run up the middle, but
sparking -the Steelers to an
exciting, point-scoring offensive
show. "

Gilliam, the first black quarter-

Pittsburgh to an easy 30-0 win over
Baltimorein the season opener,
then brought the Steelers from a
21-7 deﬁcit to a 35-35 tie with
Denver in the second game.

But for the past nine quarters, the
Steelers have managed _ just one
touchdown and a change at the
offensive helm may be imminent.

TERRY BRADSHAW *

Pearson and Rocky Bleier, who
sparkled in the final 30 minutes at
Houston, deserve a shot at starting
against Kansas City.

The Steelers, a pre-season AFC
Central Division favorite, trail
Cincinnati by a half game, after
losing one game and tying another
in their first four starts.

And coming on the heels of their

‘ stumbling 17-0 loss to Oakland nine

days ago, Sunday’s 13-7 win didn’t
leave, any one in the ofﬁcial
Steelers family overjoyed, although
Noll found ‘one shred of a silver
lining-

“The defense played exceptional-
ly,” he said, even though Houston
ranks 22nd in scoring of 26 NFL
teams.

Two players were allowed to skip
practice today. Running back Steve
Davis and rookie defensive back
Richard Conn were allowed to visit
their’ families after the deaths of
close relatives.

 

 

Pens Open 1 9 7 4 Season]

BY CONNIE GIEL

With last weekend‘s exhibition

defeat but ending in triumph. the
Pittsburgh Penguins approach to-
night's season opener in Minnesota
with confidence to spare. But the
Pens may have to cramp their style
to conform to NHL‘ standards.
which tend to emphasize finesse
rather than fisticuffs.

The performance that netted the
Philadelphia Flyers the coveted
Stanley Cup was repeated in their
5-2 win .last Saturday over the
Penguins at the Civic Arena. Dave

Schultz and Company dominated

the game from start to finish,-
overshadowing the efforts of
teammates Bobby Clarke and Gary
Dornhoefer, who nevertheless
managed to rack up three goals and
several Penguins between them.
Penguin muscleman Steve Dur-
bano was conspicuously absent
(downed by the persistent training
camp flu), as cheap shots "went
unavenged. Defensemen Jean Guy
Lagace, Bob Paradise,’ Ron Stack-
house, and Dave Burrows had less
than exceptional games, and Ab
DeMarco’s play was perhaps
indicative of the spirit that
pervaded the Arena. The walls
didn’t shake with the howls of
“Saturday Night's Alright, for
Fighting;” both organ and fans
were depressingly silent. The 6,802
spectators watched glumly as the
Pens’ ﬁrst period 2-0 lead dwindled

In any event, the absence of Apps
and Durbano could not have been
the deciding factor in the game. It
was the Flyers’ all the way.
Training camp was long and hard,
granted, and the exhibition games
weren't much fun (after all, they

Championship playoffs.

Saturday night blahs disappeared
by Sunday evening in a free-for-all
against the WHA Cleveland
Crusaders in a curious mixture of
superb offensive and all-out defen-
sive play by the Penguins. The
game ended, or rather was
finished, with 4:38 remaining and
the score Penguins 5, Crusaders 3.
Goalies Johson and Whidden
(replaced in the second period)
could very. well have played
tiddlywinks for all the attention
they received. ’

Steve Durbano, quite obviously
recovered from the flu, innocently
touched the grumpy Crusaders
when he gave Gerry Pinder of
Cleveland one clobbering too
many. Pinder’s plight aroused the
Ohioans’ ire, and the whole team

surged self-righteously, onto the
ice. The Penguin bench was not -
-long in following, with the lcehouse

Gang having a field day. By -all
accounts, the game ended‘ when
Cleveland goalies Whidden and
Stewart skated off the ice,
teammates close behind. The
Crusaders refused to continue the
game, thus winding up" the
exhibition series for the Pens.
The triumph was not without its
casualties, however. All-Star de-
fenseman Dave Burrows stopped a
puck with his only-human ankle,
picking up a bruise which is
expected to keep him out of
tonight’s game. Wingers Yves
Bergeron, and Don Seiling played
well albeit not too long, as
Bergoron bumped his head on the
boards and Seiling spent some time

- in the penalty box.

Other Penguins turned in non-pu-
gilistic performances which gave

the game a semblance of hockey as V

perfectionists know it. RoniLalonde
moved in on goal to score three
times'in a row for a hat trick that
pulled the game around for the
Penguins. The 21-year-old center
made the score 3-2 with an assist
and two goals in the second period,
and opened the final. period with
another. Center Apps also scored
in the last period with an assist
from 18-year-old Pierre Larolghe,

Coach Kromer, former volleyball
coach at Montour High School,
was hired last spring. She was a
member of Pittsburgh Women’s
Power Volleyball for seven years
and traveled all over the eastern US
in competitive tournaments until a
knee injury forced her to quit
playing. But as for coaching,
Kromer is enthusiastic.

“Our team is very young,” Kro-

mer said. “I've got two seniors, six -

sophmores, and six freshmen. I
expect them to win and I expect
them to learn. I want each girl to
give 150%. -
The women obviously gave it last
week-end, when the new team beat
well established Penn State. Yet
Coach Kromer remains optimistic
about the future. “We are a very
inexperienced team, but hopefully
we’ll win. The tough teams, the
established teams,
Rock, Indiana and Ashland.”

As for the new program here at‘
Pitt, Kromer is pleased. Everyone.
‘seems to be cooperating in giving

the women’s program a good start.
The team received new uniforms,
enough equipment, and adequate

Collegiate power volleyball is the
name of the game and it’s quite

a different from what you’re used to

seeing in high school gym classes.
The women practive five days a

draw a better lineup of competi-

went to which division.

Sure Ken Dryden’s back and he'll
probably prove that he IS the best

dow of a doubt. But the Habs will
need more than Dryden, Wayne

Besides, the Big M. Frank Mahov-
lich isn't around anymore and
Henri Richard should have hung
‘em up back in '73 if he wanted to
go out with a Stanley Cup.
Not one Canadian was named to
the NHL first or second All-Star
— team last season and that is an
indication of what Pollock has to
work with. It’s undeniable coach
Scotty Bowman has perhaps the
greatest depth in his bench, but the
caliber of individual talent on the
Canadians is no longer of super-
star proportions.‘
Serge Savard (when he’s healthy)
Jacques Lapperriere, and Guy La-
pointe are the vets heading the all

important blue line staff with Larry‘
M Robinson and Pierre Bouchard

tagging along. Bouchard was

about toj-ump to the WHA when he‘

learned Pollock might not protect
him in the last intra-league draft.
but changed his mind as soon as
Pollock did. Add inexperienced
John Van Boxmeer, the hit man, to
the defense list. Laperriere will be
making a comeback off a knee
injury that forced him to miss the
last quarter of the 73-74 campaign.

Yvan Courneyer. the Roadrunner,
heads the list of forwards with nine

game winning goals last year out of .

a total of 40. Pete Mahovlich is

by Jacques Lemaire and Yvon
Lambert. At right wing, Cour-
noyers' counterparts include
Claude Larose :when he’s healthy),
Glen Goldup (who?). Jim Roberts
and Guy Lafluer, when the latter is
not at center.

The Big M’s departure has left a
glaring hole at left wing with not
much but some questionable po-
tential to fill it; Steve Shutt [15
goals], Murray Wilson [17 goals],

Bob Gainey [thre goals] and Glenn’

Sather, an oldster who tallied 15
times for St. Louis last year,

The classy Frenchmen are still

The Pittsburgh Penguins, who
desperately need to turn their
sagging franchise_ around at the
gate, revamped their team. in
midseason and it looks like they
have the potential to hold off the
Los Angeles Kings, who made the
playoffs last spring.

The two spots the Pens have
question marks are between the
pipes and down the middle. Bob
Johnson, whose performance in the

‘-AHL playoffs gave the Hershey
Bears the Calder Cup, should have

been in a Penguin uniform last
year. Second year man Gary

BY JOHN C. BLACKBURN
The 37th Rolling Rock Races
near Ligonier Saturday had some-
thing for everyone.

They had extraordinary beauty--
nothing is more beautiful than the
Laurel Mountains on a clear
autumn afternoon.

They had tradition, in the annual
appearance of the Rolling Rock
hounds, who still compete with
other groups of dogs in actual
foxhunts.

They had opportunities for all
sorts of people to drown them-
selves in conviviality. There were

people who brought exotic foods.
expensive wines. full-scale liquor
cabinets and even silver candelabra
to their picnics, and drove back to
Fox Chapel in Cadillacs or gigantic
motor homes.

And there were people who
brought kolbassi and Iron City, and
drove back to Lawrenceville,
jammed with five others in a ’48
Plymouth. '

The races had elements of ancient
gladiatorial combat--inebriated
spectators, safe at their distance,
joking about the dangers of
steeplechase racing. .

Perhaps “Speed Kills" was the
lesson of the day. In the feature
race of Saturday's program, the
$25,000 Temple Gwathmey Cup
and International Gold Cup, a dark
horse called Speed Kills jumped off
to a big early lead. By the halfway
mark of the 21/2 miles. he was in a
tight three-way duel with Tarratine
and favorite Castlebar II, who had
won the big raceot Wednesday's
opening program, the Rolling Rock
Hunt Cup.

With less than a mile to go,
longshot Arctic Joe burst from
behind into a big lead and had little

Mike Corrigan, Gene Carr, Terry

St. Marseille are what‘ put the
Kings into the "Cup quarterfinals
last year. They are of about equal
caliber but have combined well for
owner Jack Kent Cooke.

Vachon, dealt from Montreal in
’71 with the arrival of Dryden, has
been superb, posting a goals-
against below three, despite play-
ing behind amediocre defense.
Behind him is Gary Edwards, who
just may remain a backup goaler
for the rest of his career.

The Kings play a boring type of
hockey but have been successful.

‘ They play the body and concentrate

on both aspects of the game with
diligence. Pulford’s days with the
Toronto Maple Leafs have taught
the value of backchecking. But last
year’s - performance could have
been a ﬂuke. They are lucky to be
in what has to be called a weak
division.

Detroit and Washington. Alex

.DeIvechio’s problems aren’t any-

where near being solved. Any
team that would sign defenseman
Bryan Watson to a multi-year
contract is hurting at the blue line.
Marcel Dione, the newly appointed
captain, wanted to be traded last

year to Montreal because he knew"

his talents were being wasted in
the Motor City.

Goalie Jim Rutherford was losing,
his effectiveness at Pittsburgh
primarily because of his defense-

from stand-up to flopping out of

desperation. But now he finds
himself behind two ex-Penguins,
Watson and Jack Lynch, both of
whose ineptness rode them out of a
town where they were favorites.
Mick Redmond’s 51 goals last
year earn him respect for his shot
but he and Dionne must be
temporarily satisfied with playing
the role of the franchise rebuilders.
At a time when the parity of the
league had not been re-established

LO\IE OF CHRIST

FOR ALL PEOPLE.

_ Have you ever considered the priesthood as a way
to serve people? The Paulist Fathers are a small
community of American priests. Progressive, searching,
young and energetic, they form a religious family.
A Paulis-t is a man of the Spirit, a man of his time.
He rejoices in the signs of hope around him and

celebrates with the people he serves.

Every Paulist is a missionary; in the pulpit, or parish
house, on the campus, in the inner-city. He communi-
cates with the spoken word, the printed page, and with
contemporary media. His mission is to all of America.
His message is love; the love of Christ for all people.
