Sports Eclitor Analyses
Recent Pitt Gricl Trenol

By ELAINE KAHN, sports editor

Four years ago the University said good-bye to big-
time, high power football. For the good of the University
and of the sport itself, football was deemphasized.

Assuming that the success of the deemphasis program
is to be judged upon the basis of games lost and points rolled
up by opposing teams, the University made a thorough if
not admirable job of it. Out of the four years, in a football
manner of speaking, have come three good things. No. 1
was the surprise victory over Fordham in 1941. No. 2 was
the «equally surprising show they made against Great Lakes
in 1942. No. 3 was the announcement three weeks ago that
Clark Shaughnessy was to be the new head football coach.

Yet these four years have not been without, a purpose.
In their own way they have even been a good four years. ,
For one thing, athletics and education, which had grown far ’
apart, have affected a needed reconcilliation. Pitt has had a‘
chance to prove that it is an institution of learning and not
merely’ the conventional corollary to a football team that it
had come to be regarded. When Pitt football collapsed, the
University did not, as some expected and others hoped, col-
lapse. If anything, it grew stronger. In this respect we might
add that we know of no one, aside, possibly, from a few itin-
erant football players, who failed to come to Pitt because it

no longer supported a Rose Bowl entry..

It has also been’ an interesting four years in regard to
the changing attitude of the student body toward the foot-
ball teams. Gone is the blase, slightly bored student of the
“good old days” who wandered into a game with an “if-WE-
don’t-win-this-by-forty-points-THEY-ought-to-be-shot"
titude. The students in recent years have supported the team
for the team’s sake alone.‘If there was a certain appreciable

  Chancellor Pleased  
9 At New Cl'lOlC€

Chancellor John Gabbert Bowman, in an“
interview exclusive to The Pitt News, has .de- ‘
nied that the signing of Clark Shaughnessy 
as head football coach portends anything in
the way of a new Deal for Pitt football. “Wu ‘I
never had an Old Deal,” declared’ the Chan-
cellor, who, nevertheless, expressed deep, sat-
isfaction at the move which brought to Pitt
one of the foremost football coaches in the 0 0
country.

“I am happy at Mr. Shaughnessy’s 1.3- i
ceptance,’? stated the Chancellor. “We want- i
ed to get the best football coach in the ‘
country. We believe we got him. Mr. '
Shaughnessy is an able coach and has a re-* I
markable personality.”

Terming it all a part of the move begun
four years ago Dr. Bowman said, “Our ac-
tions now as they have been during the past
four years have been designed to give foot 
ball back to the student body and to the fans ' 3 '*
in this city who pay to watch it." ’ '

Dr. Bowman also denied that Clark ' 0
Shaughnessy’s coming would in any way af-
fect the present University policy toward _l A
football. “Things will be as they were," he
stated. He added that “as long as we play on
equal terms with the other teams and as
long as we have the usual Pitt‘ spirit, we’ll ~
have good football teams.” - -

As to the effect that present draft regulr-I 
tions will have on a 1943 football squad Dr- _l
Bowman emphasized the fact that Pitt will be’
neither better nor worse than the other 53
teams. “If they use freshmen, we use fres‘_;- “ a
men,” he declared. “But as long as we play E 1.
on equal terms I think things will come out p, 
all right.” ~ ‘ F

The Chancellor scoffed at reports that
the University had ever had any intentions
of dropping football. “Competitive athletics
are a good thing,” he stated, “not only for the
boys who participate but for the fans who
sit in the stands and watch.” it i _l

The new coach will be listed as footbail 
coach with the rank of full professor. In 5

Committee Set Up

Student Faculty Association's assembly, for over a year
the target of criticism and censure, formally dissolved itself
January 21, 1943, and set up in its place a six’ student-three

duration at the University.
This "action, which marked
the end of the one year trial
of “equal representation,”
came as an outgrowth of ‘Al Mav-
rinac's, C44, proposal to set up a
ﬁve-man committee having. the
Assembly’s powers and functions.

After Mavrinac‘ made his pro-
posal, which called for a four-
student group divided equally be-
tween fraternities and independ-
ents, of two men and two wom-

was sent to the constitutional re-

stormy sessions featured by‘for-

Learn For War . . . bl

life at a university was for most a goodtime, four-year stretch
where ones intellectual powers were not to be overworked,
some sort of “philosophy of life” groundwork was to be laid,

and the personal economics of future bread and butter were
to be automatically solved after one had ones diploma in ones

‘A hand. Whether that type of university life will be restored

after the war is a question best argued between the Recon-

Status Quos.

kstructional Idealists and the Reactionary Restorers of the

But today a young man enters a university after three
and a half years of high school education with no positive
assurance how long he will stay, what studies he must begin,
what he will do with his boyhood dreams and ambitions. He
knows only one thing: his country is at war. He assumes that
a university today offers no shelter for a sprouting poet, for,
despite the valiant efforts of professional educators, liberal
education has been laid away temporarily by militarism.

What, then, shall he do?

Like a brazen advertisement, the writing is on the wall,
learn for war; time is short; learn for war. Education with its
multi-fold purposes has been given one that comes before all
others. Education is not something to pass the time with at
school. It is not something with which to flex the intellectual
muscles. It is not something that will come in handy when
there is no more money to jingle. Education in all U. S. uni-
versities today is ﬁrst and foremost, if not forevermost, for"
war—total war. If this freshman has aspirations toward writ-
ing poetry, toward making money, toward building airplanes
he can be assured, he will be assured, that this war touches

even the least of us.

Yet with what time there is the freshman can learn many “   it

things which, inﬁnitesimal as each may seem in the panorama
of a world war, will someday save his life and will help him
to win the days of peace of which we see so little and have
come lately to appreciate so much.

It has been advised that freshmen try to get as much
technical training as possible. For this is -a technical war. The
most he can do is to get some foundation that can be used /for
later specialized training which the Army and the Navy are
prepared to give him after he is inducted. A freshman should
get used to regimen without which he must be left behind.
Time isshort and must be made purposeful. Mathematics,
basic English, modern history, and as much science as
possible are the foundations on which the freshman should
build now. That is what the Army and Navy recommend and
that is what he can get at this University if he can read the
writing on the wall: learn for war, time is short.

lack of enthusiasm on the part of the students regarding
such matters as 59-0 and 50-0 scores, they were, at least,
always ready to shout “Our team is red hot” with the slight-
est encouragement” and to fully cheer and appreciate those
"occasions when the team managed to feel the same way

about itself. ‘

‘ The unfortunate ﬁgure in it all is the now ex-coach,
{Charles Bowser. It is doubtful whether Rockne himself, at
‘ the full height of his popularity, would have been more wel-

come or more popular than Mr. Bowser was at the time. At
all times Mr. Bowser occupied what is known in the ver-

} nacular as a hot seat and, you. may be sure that the current
was on all the time. Mr. Bowser had his faults, not the least
of which was a certain lack of tact with the, press, although
on this score we offer the not too profound observation that
‘it is -much easier to give criticism than to take it——particu-
larly. four years of it. Yet, the worst that can really be said
of Mr. Bowser is that he was asked to do the impossible and
that people were angry when he failed to do "it.

That the signing of Clark Shaughnessy in any way in-
dicates a return to the “good old days” of Pitt football, we
rather doubt. But that it does mean better days for Pitt foot-
ball there is no doubt.

Many have asked why bring in any coach at this time,
let alone one of Shaughnessy’s stature. The answer to this

_ is why not bring in a coach at this time. The selection of Mr.
Shaughnessy with the “greatest coach in the country” angle
tacked on seems a wise and farsighted move on the part of
University officials. Getting a name coach was the thing to
do. It was the one thing that would stir the imagination of
indifferent Pitt football fans who had" “gotten that wa.y”
watching four years of indifferent football. I

It was the thing that would erase some of the old bit-
terness, for even the staunchest holders of the theory that
“Jock” is the greatest coach in the country will concede that

Clark Shaughnessy is a pretty good second choice. Further- '

more, this WAS the time to do it. The pressure is on win-
ning the war. Football, like everything else, is secondary. Mr.
Shaughnessy can spend his time and energies building for
the future and for the boom athletics after the war.

_ Four years ago Clark Shaughnessy would have been no
=»more welcome than was Charles Bowser. Today his position
--is just as favorable as Bowser’s was not. In 1938 Pitt foot-
ball had reached a point where it could go only in one direc-

' tion and that was down. In 1943 Pitt football is at a point

where only by excavation could it go much lower. It must
come up.

On his side, Clark Shaughnessy has city—w-ide interest,
cooperation, and sympathy. Even if draft regulations, and
the uncertainties of war make immediate Rose Bowl contend-
ers impossible, Mr. Shaughnessy can devote himself to mak-
ing friends and inﬂuencing people. And from what we have
observed he is already off to a good start in that direction.
I: Pitt football has passed through its purgatory. The civil
‘;,wars between the pro—Sutherland and anti—Sutherland forces
/that accompanied its period of deemphasis have abated or
is been forgotten. This, then, the Shaughnessy era, might be

Play West Pointers Tomorrow

.Ass-[hey Aim For Win No. Nine

By MIKE HERMAN
The Rinkydink Rioters froni Pitt
Stadium travel to the United
States Military Academy tomorrow
night to take on the Army cadets.
On the basis of previous records,

Pitt has been installed as a heavy

favorite, but it would not be too
much out of the ordinary for the
Army men to upset the dope
sheets. However, if scores of games
played with mutual opponents can
be assigned any value, then the
Panthers should win handily, for
Army lost to West Virginia, 50-35,
while Doc Carlson’s boys took the
same team, 48-31.

Pitt has been ri(ling high, wide,
and handsome, but loss of key
players may cramp its winning
style. Paul Lohmeyer and Johnny

Swacus are in the Army Reserve, -

and expect an early call to active
duty. Arty Artman is a member
of the Naval Reserve, and, while
it is expected that he will ﬁnish
this semester, may be called to
active duty sometime before the
season’s end. And Ed Latagliata
expects a very early call from his
draft board.

However, it can be said with
reasonable safety that the other
key men will be here when tour-
nament invitation time rolls
around. Tay Malarkey is in Den-
tal School, and therefore defer-
red until he graduates. Walt
Jones has been deferred, and
Steve Zerich has been accepted
by the School of Medicine. He
enters in March.

Another bright light in Doctor
Carlson’s horizon is the fact that
there are several promising young"
ballplayers who have attained
sophomore status this semester
and are therefore eligible for var-
sity competition. One of these is

Paul Goodwin.

Goodwin has yet to prove that
he can ﬁt into the Carlson style
of play, but if past results are any
criterion, Paul will see plenty of
action. Playing for the relatively
weak Pittsburgh Olympics, he was
fourth highest scorer in the Muni-
cipal League, the fastest in this
area. He also represented Phi
Gamma Delta in some of their in-
tramural games, and came away
with his share of scoring honors.

Don’t say a word, but it has
been whispered around school
that the Panthers are gunning
for an invitation to represent
District 2 in the National Col-
legiate Athletic Association tour-
nament to be held in New York
in March. When the subject was
brought up, Doctor Carlson re-
plied, “We’re playing each game
as it comes along, but we’re not
ignoring our NCAA. standing on-
tirely.”

College Role in VVarti'me,

“Colleges Must Educate for Im-
mediate Needs.” That is the theme
of the winter issue of the Pitt
Quarterly in which the war pro-
gram of the University is discuss-
ed in complete detail.

As a result of joint planning by
University 'Deans and Senate
Committees, suggestions for high
school seniors, men and women
students at the University, and a
recommended program for the
University during the war are
embodied in an article about the
war program.

With the appropriate caption,
“Yanks in the Cathedral,” Lotte
O. Lohstoeter, assistant professor
of modern languages, attributes the

difference in the Cathedral this
year to the “Yanks,” not in branch-
es of the services, but in our own

student body. Students who volun- ‘
tarily sacriﬁce their ten minute in- ‘
