A Time For Seeking  

Almost one thousand years ago wise men of the East
stood in awful wonder before a rising star from the ‘West.
Today wise men of the West meet anxiously to consider a
rising star from the East.

The ﬁrst had seen the Builder of the Universe laid silent-
ly in a cow shed. The latter see the makers of minute stars
implanted roaringly in domed palaces.

And yet the recent Maji stand afraid, reflective and still
before their Christmas ﬁres.

They shuffle and speak of little moons and little men.
They say softly that they’re crushed and must ﬁght back
with bigger little moons and bigger little men.

Their holly and pine and ﬁrelight are their mirrors notﬁ
their comfort. Instead of opening their minds to the vastness
of creation and of life these symbols echo darkly narrow
thoughts of explosion and of death.

But God made man. It’s only little man who is trying to
destroy him.

Man thought the end had come in catapults and gun-
powder. He thought the end had come in spears nd arrows.
He thought the end had come in atoms. Now he thinks the
end is coming in man—made moons.

He knows that earth is one of the smaller planets. He
knows that the solar system is one of average size. He knows
that his galaxy is one of so many he cannot count them.

And yet he thinks he- is going to end it all with light
weight spheres some meager yards across.

These are his Christmas thoughts for ’57. These weights
press down upon his shoulders and make him see more in
the shadow than in the light.

But though man seldom looks into the light he always
ﬁnds himself in the midst of it. He sings and drinks a merry
cup throughout his life. He decorates his drabness with tin-
sel and ﬁlls his mustiness with pine needles and hickory
smoke.vHe looks around and rediscovers in his dusty eyes the
spinning ﬂares of candle points.

IN ‘58  

Chancellor Shows Plan;
Hears Students, Faculty

By MILLARD AMDUR
Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld and the Trimester Cal-

endar Committee announced
Fall 1958.

today trimester proposals for

A test plan for such a program has been published in
booklet form to be sent to all full-time faculty members for
“thoughtful consideration and constructive response.”

The chancellor introduced the educational novelty in

. his inaugural address last May. He offered the trimester pro-
ﬁt‘ gram as one which might enable Pitt to take the lead in meet-

ing the American educational crisis, all this prior tosthe

launching of Sputnik I and II.

. This plan could reduce the span of time required of the

student without reducing the qual- O-~— — - 

ity of instruction and might also
allow larger capacity without pro-
portionate increase in physical
plant.

The committee which issued the
booklet for faculty is under the
chairmanship of Dr. Putnam
Jones, dean of the graduate facul-
ty and director of the Office of
Educational research.

See Student Opinion Poll on
Trimesters on Page 3

The booklet, entitled “Back-
ground For A Study Of The Feasi-
bility Of A Trimester Plan,” cov-
ers the advantages completely and
deﬁnitely states: “This group con-
cluded that in most areas‘ of the
University the advantages of a
trimester plan far outweigh the
disadvantages.”

It goes on to say that it might
not indeed be a bad idea to in-
corporate such a program in
“some units of the University as
early as 1958.”

The suggested trimester calen-
dar for school year ’58-’59, includ-
ed in booklet and release to the
press, is as follows:

Autumn Trimester (Registration
Sept. 2-6); 15 week session, Sept.
8-Dec. 23, 1958.

W i n t e r Trimester registration
would take place on Jan. 2-3; 15

Spring Trimester registration un-

Apr. 23-25, 1959; 15 week session,
Apr. 27-Aug. 8, 1959.

Summer vacation of one month
would be from Aug. 9-Sept. 8
1959, inclusive.

Other features of the program
under consideration include “equal
educational weight” and import-
ance to each trimester.

To Trimester Plan

By DONNA CONSIDINE.
A recent poll conducted by the Pitt News on the subject

of the trimester plan shows that about two—thirds,_of the stu-

dents are opposed to the plan.

Six percent thought it might be good for some and dis-
‘ advantageous for others while 18 percent favored the idea.
i Some of the student reactions for the plan are as follows:

Steve Dorenda, Col. ’58, said, “I6

think it’s a good idea. Constant

 .‘ classes would avoid a slack, and

;forgetting over vacations would
 be at a minimum.” T
» Mary Ann‘ Hanley, Col. ’60 likes

tl_1€e,idea' of being able to ﬁnish
her schooling more quickly.
Howard B. Evans, Col. ’60, feels

that one result would be more
. concentrated courses with an eli-

,:mination of needless material. “It

would also take less time to get a

degree,” he stated.

T;James Musilek, Bus. Ad '58 is

,also in favor of getting his degree
,8. year sooner.

Gary Prinz, Col. ’60 said, “I think

,it’s a good idea. Other schools do
.it.' Students could catch up on

things in the summer and go

. straight on to graduate school.”
Tlluth Roe, Ed. ’59, said, “I think

it’s a good idea, but I wonder how

i they will work student teaching

...._..4,-..-,.,.—_.__,,.. ._c...,. ......, ...

around this plan.” '

Ronald Zimmerman, Col. ’58, is in
fgyor of trimesters because it
would put the student into indus-
try a year ahead of the usual time.
“You can make maybe $500 in a
summer. Getting out a year early
would give students an opportu-
nity to, make more money than
they would during the summer. .

 Dick Meyer, Col. ’58, thinks that
kthe system “would be good aca-

'. demically.”

He added that stu-

 dents would not lose so much ma-

terial as after a long vacation.
Robert Miller, Engr. ’6l, said, “It

7 would beneﬁt me personally since

I am in ‘the night school and
could carry more credits per

 . year.”

Opinions of those opposed ‘to

 the plan are:

MES INSPECTEUS

Margie Byrne, Col. ’60, “Students
need a break to rid themselves of
scholastic burdens.”

Ann Kennedy, Col. ’58, and Billie
De Turk, Ed. '59, agreed that stu-
dents are not able to digest their
education with the present system
let alone in three years. They
were concerned with problems of
earning tuition and the sense of a
factory system.

Jim Dempsey, Col. ’61, likes the
present two semester system.
“There is enough confusion at
registration now. What would it
be like with three per year?”

Rita Carboni, Col. ’60, “It would
be bad for people who have to
work.”

J.“ Tulenko, Col. ’61, and Joyce
Posch, Ed. ’61, stated that they
deﬁnitely would not like a tri-
mester because they would be be-
hind their class if they dropped
out to work, and they think that
students need a balance of work
and recreation.

Leo Ketter, Engr. ’58, says it
means too much school and not
enough rest.

Ronald Podmilsak, Col. ’60, ‘and
Francis Studnicki, Col. ’60 think
that it would be bad for the work-
ing student. ‘ ‘

Mildred Ostermeier, Bus. Ad. ’59,
said, f_‘I' couldn’t attend school all
summer. Besides, there would be a

confusion‘ of courses for those not-

going all three semesters.”

Lee Engdahl, Engr. ’59, felt that a
few students in the Engineering
School can study for three years
straight at the present rate.

Florida Takes  
DebateTourney_

The University of. Florida
ﬁnished ﬁrst in competition
among 53 other University
and college teams in the
Tenth Annual Cross-Exam-
ination Debate Tournament
held at Pitt last Friday and Sat-
urday._The four Florida debaters
scored a total team rating of 122
points out of a possible 140. ’

Receive Trophy it
Leo Murphy, Director of Public
Relations for Crucible Steel of
America, came here Saturday to

to Florida. As well as winning
this rotating award, the Southern-
ers also received a permanent
trophy, ‘
Close behind the Florida team,
with a total of 118, was Pitt’s M
Debate team. On that team were
John Strauch, Col. ’60, Publicity
Manager of the debate union;
James Pomarico, Col. ’59, Tele-
vision Manager; Gary Hess, Col.
’59, President; and Dick Mat-
tern, Col. ’59, Public Debates
Manager. ' '
Hess also received a medal for
being among the top ﬁve speakers
of the tournament.

Norman Patasky, Engr. ’60, cited
the need for a vacation also,
thinks it’s a good idea for stu-
dents who want to go on quickly.

Carolyn Mazur,' Ed. ’58, fears the
lack of class. spirit which would
result from student’s dropping out
for a" semester and the returning.
“Students also need time to con-
solodate the ideas they get in the
classroom.”

Matt Crofton, Col. ’e1, Tom ﬂinch-

tberger, Col. ’61 and Tom Phillips,

Bus. Ad. ’59, said that summer is
not 'only,a period for change of

untary. ‘

The Chancellor emphasized

the “optional participation” in

the program. In other words, a

student might attend only two

of the three trimesters and com-
plete the work now done in two
semesters.

He would then have free to
work from Apr. 27-Sept. 8, if he
chose to omit the spring semester.

Lists. Advantages

The faculty leaflet summarizes
advantages for the working stu-
dent in such a program. “If a stu-
dent chooses to seek employment
during the spring trimester, he is
earlier available in the summer
employment market.”

It also mentions the fact that
some students may prefer to
seek employment during the
non-summer months, “when
some employers are better able
to use additional help.”

It closes with the statement that
most of students not requiring
aforesaid employment “would
seize the opportunity of remain-
ing in school for the few weeks
beyond customary June closings”
and earn the half-year additional
credit.

More Funds Planned

More funds would be made
available for aid to students elect-
ing the full trimester plan.

Although the problem of tui-
tion is not mentioned, ‘each tri-
mester might cost the present
price of a semester since faculty
salaries for those members elect-
ing 12-month teaching appoint-
ments would be up ‘A; “to cover
the additional two months of
service and one month of vaca-
tion.”

Faculty members would have a
choice of selecting any of three
plans, subject to their “research
capabilities and interests” as well
as availability of additional re-
search funds.

3 Appointments Possible

The three faculty appointments
wouldbe nine-month teaching ap-

ter Calendar include English.
Chemistry, Political Science.

Law, and Electrical Engineering.

A laison person from each of
these varied departments nxet
with the committee and brought
back ﬁndings to be discussed with
faculty colleagues.

Education ’More Complete

Chancellor Litchﬁeld points out
major advantages of the plan.
“Students would be able to ob-
tain a more complete education
within the time usually spent in

two-semester calendar.”

He pointed out the ‘economic
advantages of entering the busi-
ness and professional worlds
earlier than ever before possible.
Speciﬁc instance in this case:
“The equivalent of four-year
liberal arts program and full
course in law or medicine in
ﬁve years.”

A program encompassing a lib-

business administration in four
years might be accomplished. A
four year bachelor’s degree pro-
gram could be completed in 2 and
% years. _

Also mentioned are the rota-
tional possibilities enabling fac-
ulty‘ to travel, do research, or the

mer.

Dr. Charles Peake held a
meeting yesterday with student
leaders to seek their views.
Deans, directors, and faculty are
ﬁling comment on the trimester
booklet. . ’ T

The entire study will be re-
viewed before the ﬁnal action is
taken by the Chancellor. Dr. Jones
also mentioned the possibility of
implementation by fall 1958 in
“several of the University's
schools.”

Sans Pa wer — Sans Strengt
~ It is all very well to change the structures of student
government. The University of Pittsburgh Student Govern-
ment Association has been a long time in the planning stage
‘and is now almost ready to be implemented. L
Whether or not this will affect the scope and impact of
the governmental body on the students is a matter that
demands closer scrutiny: Student Congress may hardly be
termed the representatives of the total student body. 0

The new organization. may have an external structure
quite different from the present one. But the authority of
this body- will not differssigniﬁcantly from that of Student
‘Congress. Under the present system, the sole purpose of

‘the groups appears to be in training——in parliamentary pro-
cedures and the like—-future lawyers and ladies hospital
aid. presidents.

One major aim of any new student governing body
should be to wield power, certainly not dictatorial in nature
but nevertheless distinctive, in the matter of budget. The
budget of the Student Congress covers few of the activity
interests and projects in which)Student Government bodies
should have an interest. «

I Polaris is the only activity,beyond Student Congress
. Committee projects that SC has ‘been able to sponsor. A
student government which is to be respected must really af-
fect students to gain recognition for itself. a
0 There will then be no problem in recruiting enough
people to run for office. No longer will the whole system be
a sham.

All full—time students pay a so-called University Fee of

$24 each semester. They should have a voice ‘in’ distributing
this sum of $288,000 per year for the 6,000 full-time under-
, graduates, or, at least, a great deal morethan the pitiably
small budget allotted to Student Congress. The students are
mature enough to determine which University student
projects are deserving of support. , ’
SC should be mature enough, too, to decide which ac-
tivity interests rate backing and how extensive the budg-
etarye allotments should be to each. The students, perhaps,
«are far more aware of these. things than administration can
be. This is student government:
It is ﬁne to suggest new pencil sharpeners for the school
as well as creating car pools. What recourse does Student

9 Congress have but to do these triﬂes? The assemblies com-

fnittee has been doing a wonderful job in bringing prom-
inent individuals before elements of the student body. But

;-N this is hardly government.

been tightened. All in all it has
been a year in which the Univer-

of being content to stand still

Free Discussion Is Aim Of YGroup

 Brittain’s Home
Is Open To New

Coed Organization
By TERRY SIRIANNI

One of the main purposes
of the Student-Faculty Dis-
cussion Groups, sponsored by
YM-YWCA, is to provide the
students with the experience
of free discussion.

Dr. Raymond F. Brittain, as-
sociate professor of history of
religion, unselﬁshlyi opens his
home and gives up his free time
to some 20 interested students
who have formed and organized
one of these discussion groups.

Each Group Free

The “Y” program allows flexi-
bility so that each group is free
to operate as it sees fit. Don Rohr-
kaste, Col. ’59, Group Leader, and
Dr. Brittain planned their first
meeting to get the semester un-
derway. From then on, however,
the group rrplans their meetings
and decides the topic of discussion
for each meetine.

Dr. Brittain’s group meets
once a month usually for a
whole evening. The stu-
dents are‘ never rushed and are
free to express themselves open-
ly in an informal discussion. The
meeting usually starts oﬂ? with
the introduction of any new
members and then ideas for the
Ifext month’s meeting are pre-
sented followed by discussion of
the topic for the evening.

Lorraine Furlan, Col. ’60, a
member of this group, comment-
ed that “It’s a group in which
we can really talk things over.”

The group is made up of a var-
iety of students including fresh-
men through graduates which pro-
vides a background for interest-
ing discussions. “We are all bene-
ﬁting frorh these meetings,” Don
added. The freshmen are en-
couraged to bring up their pro-
blems at any time. The group
tries to clear up any misconcep-
tions they might have about Pitt
and offers any suggestions that
might help. i
’ Topics Picked

Topics for discussion are picked
for their enjoyability and signi-
ﬁcance, which lead to intelligent
discussion of ideas.

Some examples of topics dis-
cussed in this group last year are
new administration policies, vo-
cation and vacation, and favorite
hobbies.

The Dec. 23 meeting is going
to be a little different than the
usual evening» of informal dis-
cussion and education. The
group plans to go Christmas
caroling in Bellevue at its Sub-
urban General Hospital in Dr.
Brittain’s home community.
After their singing the group
will return to Dr. Brittain’s
home for light refreshments.

At the end of January, Dr.
Brittain plans to show the group
his slides of places all over the
world including such cities as
London, Paris, Istanbul, Athens,

Don remarked on how enthusi-

They are willing to contribute and
share their ideas and time. Carol
McWright, Col. ’60, said the meet-
ings give her a chance to relax

and forget about her classes for a‘

while. “I myself enjoy being

mentioned. “It’s really a joy and

group that is so good—natured.”

HolidayFestiValTourney

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

The Panther basketeers will have an active Christmas
vacation as they entertain Duke, at the Memorial Field
House on Saturday, and travel to New York to participate
in the Holiday Festival Tournament, after Christmas.

The Blue and Gold cagers will attempt to bounce back
from their setback in the Steel Bowl and improve the cur-

rent record of three. wins and a:

‘single defeat. Coach Bobby Tim-

R mons’ players have had this whole



week to prepare for the year-end
games.

The Duke Blue Devils, At-
,lantic Coast ,Conference mem-
ber, has a 2 o’clock date with
the Panthers, on Saturday aft-
ernoon. They have a 2-1 slate,
at this writing, with -wins over
Villanova and Clemson and a
losshto Kentucky’s Wildcats, by
a 78-74 count.

The game will be televised loc-
ally and will also be sent back to
the Duke home territory in Dur-
ham, North Carolina. This year’s
Blue Devil team is experienced
an! has a good height advantage
over the Jungle Cats. Co-captains
Jim Newcombe and Bobby Joe
Harris provide the main scoring
punch, with 6-7 center John La-
kata snagging the rebounds.

The Holiday Tourney, at Madi-
son Square Garden, is the biggest
Christmas competition in the
county. The Panthers will open
the eliminations on Thursday
afternoon, December 26 against
the tough Temple Owls. Other
quintets participating are Dayton,
Manhattan, Seattle, Connecticut,
N.Y.U. and California. _

If the locals can get by the
Owls and Guy Rodgers they will
meet the winner of the Dayton-
Manhattan game on Friday
night. The tourney ﬁnal will
take place on Saturday evening.

Temple may be favored to take
all the marbles on the strength‘ of
their rating as the best team in
the East. The expected duel be-
tween Rodgers and Don Hennon
should be one of the highlights of
the tournament- and the New York
hoop season. .

For Yogi Victory;
Trophy Presented

At a special meeting of the Sup-
ernatural Clairvoyant Society, on
Thanksgiving eve, the Swami
Symbol of P0wer—a genuine zir-
cont crystal ball — was presented
to the Panther football coaches in
recognition of this year’s predict-
ing championship.

Easy Ed Koltiska, sometime
boss of the News Sports Desk, re-
luctantly presented the priceless
(precisely) bauble to head coach
John Michelosen. The Coach was
gracious in this ﬁnal victorious
moment and gave credit to his as-
sistants who aided him no end

during the year.

The Mentors’ record for the
campaign was 55-29. Runner-up
was the “Charm,” Koltiska, with
a 54-34 chart. He claims typo-
graphy robbed him of ultimate
‘ victory. The player composite
was third, 53-35; Marino-Chass
combo next at 53-38.

All-Oppolient Team
Selected By Panthers

Although Oklahoma was the Panthers’ unanimous choice
as the best team they played both offensively and defensive-
ly, the Sooners only placed two men on the all-opponent
squad. ‘

Notre Dame and Army also placed two men on the squad

while West Virginia, Penn State, Syracuse, Miami, and Ore-
gon all placed one. Only Nebraskaé
and Southern California failed to
have a man selected to the All-
Opponent eleven.

Bill Krisher, a burly 6-1, 213
pound lineman, captured one of
the Guard slots while his All-
American teammate Clendon
Thomas ﬁlled in at one of the
slotback spots for the Oklahoma
Sooners.

Notre Dame also placed a line-
man and back on the squad. Don
Lawrence, who played’ a bang-up
game against the Panthers was
the choice at tackle. Nick Peitro-
santi, a hard running fullback,
was high on the voting list for the
Irish.

All-American Sophomore Can-
didate Bob Anderson was almost
an automatic choice for a slot in
the backﬁeld. Jim Kernan, a team-
mate of Andersons’, was the unan-
imous choice at center to round
out the Cadet representation.

Les Walters of Penn State,
who is claimed by Panther End
Coach Ernie Heiferlie as one of
the ﬁnest ends that he has seen
in the East, shares the terminal
slots with neighboring All-
American ‘Dick Lasse of Syra-
cuse ‘

Two of the smallest men that
the Panthers have played against
this year were also nominated.

'.l‘lrt‘ women‘s ‘Learn of the Pitt
Fencing Club was foiled last
Thursday night by a slight margin
of 5-4.

The continuation match be-
tween the University women and
the Chatham College fencers
proved to be a test of skill and
accuracy of sword play with both
teams profiting by the experi-
ence in competitive fencing.

The match began on Nov. 5; but
was called for time after three
bouts were completed.

The University was off to a
slow start by losing two out of
three bouts. The total number of
touches was fairly consistent
with Kathy Cleary bowing to
Goodstein, 5-3; Esler over Iorio,
5-2; and Lewis to Pincus, 5-2.

Thursday night’s action s'howed
a noticeable improvement in the
Pitt team’s performance as the
scores were closer in favor of the
University fencers. '

Cleary downed Iorio by a score
of 5-4 and Pincus by 5-2 touches.
'Esler bowed to Pincus by 5-3 and
Goodstein by a score of 5-2.

Lewis, unable to attend the ﬁnal
section of the meet, was replaced
by Esler and Cleary. Cleary lost
to Goodstein by 5-2 and Esler beat
Iorio by _5-2.

Congress Gives Wrath;

Answers Questions

Doctor Swartzbaugh, director of
the Student Union, answered
questions of problems peculiar to
the Union. It was explained that
the food service in the S.U. is a
“natural area of great sensitivity”
to the student.

Comparative price lists of the
“Big Ten” Universities are cur-
rently being analyzed by the Di-
rector of Auxiliary Enterprises to
study the size of portions served
in relation to the price. Labor
costs were cited as an important
consideration.

It was further noted that the
preparation of a food contract
with the University Food Serv-
ice by semester was scaled to

— the average number of meals

 

.41’.

 

 

 

parta.ken and did account for a
degree of absenteeism.

Utilization of paper plates was
necessitated by removal of dish-
washing facilities to the Union.
However, this action should not
be misconstrued as a means to
eliminate the Tuck Shop since Dr.
Swartzbaugh believes “there ex-
ists no intent to close the Tuck
Shop.”

Increase‘ Awareness

S.C. Problems Committee is
working closely with the Union
to increase awareness and reflect
student criticisms.

Reservations for noon meetings

in the Union Mondays and Fri-
days may be made _without a
luncheon whose price is ninety
cents. It will still be necessary
to maintain luncheon meetings for
the other days.
’ An infirmary for either the
Union or the Cathedral is yet to
be resolved alongwith the con-
sideration of resting facilities
for women.

Joe Martinelli, Engr. ’58, S.C.

athletic representative announced
the entire north and east stands
of the Field’ House are designated
as the student section. Saturday’s
game against Duke will be tele-
vised nationally which will begin
