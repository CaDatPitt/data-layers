Scammersphish p'itt.edu

Contributing E9itor

Pitt students beware: Scarnmers
are  for you.

_ Yesterday, Computing Services
and Systems Development updated
the my.pitt.edu Web site with a warn-
ing concerning a phishing scam that
has  some Pitt e—mai1- ac-
counts. '

The scam involved a sender ap-
peaiing to be from a legitimate com-
pany  for recipients’ personal
information. These phishing e—mails
began  an unknown number

. of Pitt students’ e-mail boxes in May.

The e-mails were ‘sent from web-
master@pitt;edu, with the 
“pittedu E-mail upgrade.” The sender

0 stated that, “The Office .of Informa-

tion Technology is in the process of

 all pittedu e-mail accounts —

to upgraded central e-mail services”

and that an “account owner that re-
fuses to update his or her e-mail ac-
count within 30 days of this
warning will lose his or her e-mail ac-
count permanently.”

The e—mail, which was sent by a
scammer, asked students to conﬁrm
their identities by  back with

their username, password, date of

birth and location.

In the event that a student did re-
spond back with the requested infor-
mation, a phisher could log into the
student’s University account Once
somebody has access to the Universi-
ty acoount, he can search the account
for more personal information that
could be used in identity theft.

\ A  code, case ID number
and/ apologetic statement from the

' phisher concluded the e—mail.

Ofﬁcials at Computing 
and Systems Development said they
aren’t sure how many phishing scams

a No Wrong answer

Students at Pittsburgh Public.
Schools are always half right

At Pittsburgh Public Schools, .

when students are wrong, they’re
also half right.

Some teachers and parents
are skeptical about a Pittsburgh
Public Schools policy that gives
students at least a 50 percent
minimum score for all assign-
ments and tests. Schoolofﬁcials
insist, however,-that the policy,
which has been in place for sev-
eral years, will encourage stu-
dents to improve their grades.

-District spokeswoman Eb-

_ ony ‘Pugh told the Pittsburgh

Post-Gazette, “We want to cre-
ate situations where students

; can recover and not give up

* not saying,‘ ‘Give people passing
2 grades. '

3))

. By policy standards, students

§ receive an “A” for grades within
 the 100 percent to 90 percent
 range, a “B” for grades  the
 89 percent to 80 percent range, a
E “C” for grades within the 79 per-
. cent to 70 percent range, a “D”
Q for grades  the 69 percent
3 to 60 percent range and an “E”
 for grades within the 59 percent
 to 50 percent range. The district
 does not issue “F” grades. A

,_ This policy has obvious ad-

3 vantages.

By instituting a minimum

 score, students are likely to be
 encouraged to work harder
 and to become more invested.
 in their academic success: The

c i plan is particularly useful to low-
 achieving students who, after-re-
 ceivingan “F,” lose the motiva-
 tion to try harder.

The plan seems especially

3 useful in elementary school,
 where grades do not matter as
A much as they dowin high school,
A as students prepare for college.
i A failing grade in elementary V
-. school, where a student starts

developing and honinga work

ethic, could hurt a child’s will to
learn, discouraging children at a
time when encouragement is key
to improving a student scholas-

' tically.

So perhaps this policyishould
only be in place in elementary
schools. ,

Because*it- is also riddled

with disadvantages, it is unclear’

whether the plan helps students
more than it hurts them. While

it could be beneﬁcial to low—. A

achieving students, it can be det-
rimental to high-achieving stu-
dents, lowering their incentive to
do well. i
Judy Leonardi, a retired dis-

’trict home economics teacher,

told the Post-Gazette that the
policy could cause high-achiev-
ing students to become ‘lazy,
knowing that they are always

guaranteed at least 50 percent.‘

Leonardi said she was opposed
to the idea that students can
“walk in the door, breathe the
air and get 50 percent for that.’_’

LetterstotheEditor

Dear Editor,

Jesse Sabatini’s letter regarding Giles Howard’s column “Palin best
female candidate from Alaska” was centered around ideology that
contradicts American liberty and law. Sabatini talks about a secular
progressive movement that “continuously mocks the Judeo-Christian
principles that this country was founded on.” Regardless of how secu-
lar our nation might have been in its infancy, I am fairly certain that
there exists a lawful and precise separation of church and state in the
United States today. Sabatini criticizes the public for condemning Gov.
Palin’s faith, but not Sen. Obama’s. While I personally respect both
candidates’ strong religious convictions, Obama’s faith does not tran-
spire in his legal decision—making. I do not understand how someone
can try to coerce his religious beliefs into the legal system of a country

that supposedly prides itself on the acceptance and incorporation of

all faiths.

I-Ioward’s original column was satirical and witty, and while it is expect-
ed that not everyone will agree with it, it brings up a very important
issue. Will this November be an election over religious morals, which
legally should not be intertwined with state affairs, or will the Ameri-
can people ﬁnally decide to vote based on the economy, foreign policy
and other issues that are applicable and lawful to all citizens?

Dear Editor,

I am responding to the Sept. 17 article, “SGB funds ﬁrst female VP candidate’s visit to Pitt.” As an
ardent Democrat and a former board member of the organization, this decision is both confounding
and troublesome. In a time when the stakes could not be higher, the willing choice to bring in a speaker
who consistently blasts Sen. Barack Obama and praises Gov. Sarah  is puzzling. Pennsylvania is a
battleground state, so why aren’t Democrats doing something more productive with their time?

The College Democrats should be seeking to unify the party, as opposed to accentuating the differences
within it. Geraldine Ferraro has proven to be nothing more than an angry woman bent on supporting

her gender at all costs. Her racially insensitive comments during the primary brought her into the public
spotlight, so why offer her another venue to express her dissatisfaction? The College Democrats should
be focusing on why Obama is our best hope in these uncertain times.

to every forgotten corner of this
country.”

Bush’s revitalizing ideas carried
him all the way to the White House,
where he began what would even-
tually become one of the most in-
famous presidential tenures of all
time.

Within his ﬁrst year of office,
Bush was confronted with national
catastrophe: the Sept. 11 hijackings,
which, though tragic, served as the
impetus to rally and reenergize our
sleeping country and propel a top-

priority war on terrorism. Accord-

ing to CBS News, in January of

2002, four months after the attack, ~

Bush had record-high approval rat-
ings of 82 percent.

But like all tragic heroes, Bush
had a tragic ﬂaw, a flaw that would
send his golden empire and favor-
able approval ratings crumbling to
pieces.

What was that tragic ﬂaw, you
may ask? Well, that’s up for debate.
Some say it was his overconﬁdence.
Others, his inability to compromise,
his impulsiveness or his Cheney.
Still yet, there are those who argue

that when Bush choked on that
pretzel, it deprived just enough
oxygen from his brain to kill what
little intelligent brain activity he had
left. The possibilities are endless.
As for me, I think it was just sheer
stupidity.

How else can you explain ly-
ing to 300 million Amencans, not
to mention the rest of the world,
about weapons of mass destruc-
tion? Or his abandonment of
millions of Katrina victims? Or
the Geneva Convention—violating
rnist:t:eat:rnent of prisoners of war

in Guantanamo Bay? The list goes
on: wire tapping, waterboarding
and more.

As things went from bad to
worse, his approval ratings con-
tinued to fall. By April 2008, Bush
recorded the lowest presidential
approval rating in the history of
the Gallup opinion poll, which was
created more than 70 years ago, at
just 28 percent, and many histori-
ans feel that Bush could go down

hero has fallen from grace and
screwed up the country along the
way.

Now we await the ﬁnal stage
of the tragic hero’s journey: Bush’s
metaphorical death is coming soon,
not soon enough frankly, but soon.

And then, ﬁnally, he will be re-
placed as president and can return

Help for the gift-

giving impaired

OmniPrint, page 1

marketing manager and a Pitts-
burgh native.

\X/hile. \X/einand does not see
OmniPrint ushering in a new
wave of business that bucks out-
sourcing, she does see the compa-
ny staking a large claim on busi-
ness’ latest trend.

“Personalization is a huge
trend right now,” she said. “You
take a product and allow custom-
ers to personalize it, make it more
their own. Bringing all of our op-
erations in house is allowing us
to do that.” In just a few weeks,
individual consumers and com-
panies alike will be able to create,
personalize and order their own
gift cards online. Those cards,
whether 100 or 500 are ordered,
will be printed on demand in
OmniPrint’s facilities.

At ﬁrst, one might underesti-
mate the value of being able to
spend nights crafting a gift card
that perfectly expresses gratitude
for your cat-sitter.

But gift cards are no longer
the sole territory of the gift giv-
ing impaired. “Corporate uses gift
cards a lot as incentive. It’s such
an easy thing to use,” said \Vein—
and.

Okay, maybe gift cards are for
the gift—giving impaired. But at
the very least, those seemingly
pointless slabs of plastic will
look unique. In terms of design,
though, it’s not hard to improve
upon Omni’s raw material.

“Wlhen an order comes in,
the cards roll into the machine.
They’re just blank white cards that
say Visa,” explained W/einand. But
those unassuming white cards
represent an intensive process of
gaining Visa certification and cus-
tomer trust that goes along with
it.

“W/e’ve been going through the
process for over a year now,” said
W/cinand. “It requires really high
security. You need to use your fin-
gerprint to enter the building. W/e
all have picture ID badges. There

are a lot of standards that people
have to go through to even get in,
like really expensive background
checks,” she said. This is part of
the reason why only three people
work in OmniPrint’s printing fa-
cility.

Chris Billiar, the director of
OmniPrint and one of the three
employees allowed on the ﬂoor
said, “It’s kind of overwhelming
at times. There are a lot of things
that need to get done and not re-
ally anyone to delegate to.”

Though the machines housed
at OmniPrint do everything —
print the design, apply the all-
important magnetic strip coded
with the dollar amount, add an
activation sticker and the please
call number -— Billiar and his as-
sociates are responsible for the
company’s 24-hour turnaround
time.

“Before we can even start the
machines, we have to ensure that
we’ve got a plan for the day,” said
Billiar, “It’s been kind of hectic,”
he laughed. “But we’re hiring
more people,” said \X/einand, a
fact that fits the company’s over-
all growth trend in the last eight
months. “At that time I started
working here, there were only 12
employees, and now we’re up to
almost 50,” she said.

Previously in the nonprofit
sector where imaginative think-
ing and good marketing skills are
a must to raise money, Weinand
finds the same creative outlet in
Omni. “Though it’s a learning
curve working for a company that
actually has money to spend,” she
said.

And for Pittsburgh, a cutting
edge company experiencing rapid
growth is a boon — especially
for the freshly graduated.

“We’re losing young people
to other cities who have technol-
ogy,” said Weinand. “This is a
high—tech environment and will
help us and Pittsburgh to keep
some of the recent grads.” With

all of the technological advances
at the company, Visa visits Omni-
Print a couple times a_ month to
make sure they’re up to standard.

“They’re very normal look-
ing,” said W/einand when asked
to describe the corporate entity.
“But in order to get into the Visa

facility you do have to wear an of-
ficial smock —— it’s just because
of ink, though.”

Despite the lack of HAZMAT
suits or slick walkie—talkies, Omni
“is a really good work environ-
ment. People here are really hard
workers, innovative and the CEO

is really concerned with making
everyone happy.”

Is that indicative of the city?

“I don’t know, that has not
been my experience at other Pitts~
burgh companies,” said Weinaiid.
“But it certainly is a nice place to
work.”

Chiodos bucks the latest trends in indie music

by Justin Jacobs
A O’ E Etlifo/'

Chiodos, with Person L, Hit the
Lights and A Voice Like Rhetoric

Wednesday, 6:30 p.m.
Mr. Smalls, Millvale
412821-4447

At first, Derrick Frost seems like a kid
with whom so many of us went to high
school: He loves The Get Up Kids, Saves
the Day and Taking Back Sunday (the

first record only, of course), he’s a bit of"

a sensitive heart, and he says “dude.” A
lot.

Yup, Frost was a good ol’ emo kid
in high school. But he was an emo kid

who played drums like a madman and’

i didn’t quite fit into his rural Texas cow-
boy town. So when he got word that a
hardcore band from Michigan needed a
new drummer, he was quick to catch a
bus north. And, as he said, “I really just
never came home.” ‘

The band was Chiodos, so named for

the moniker of three obscure ﬁlmmak-
er brothers, and with Frost in tow, they

   
  

soon released All’; Wall I/mt End; We/A an
album with song titles longer than book
chapters and a sound that twisted the
classic emo mold into something wholly
different —— bigger, more theatric and
way, way darker than your average Jimmy
Eat \World fare.

And for Frost, it was all a matter of
luck.

“It was something inside of me that
wanted to do this full time. I_was de-
termined to.get’-“out of high school and
move to California. I was in the mindset
that you have to go to California or New
York to make it in the arts,” said Frost in
an interview with The Pitt News. “That’s
definitely not true nowadays. I was will-

, ing to work as hard as I possibly could to

be in the right band with the right people
at the right time  but it really was all
about placement.”

Frost, along with frontman Craig Ow-
ens, keyboardist Bradley Bell, guitarists
Pat McManaman and Jason Hale and
bassist Matt Goddardtook the band-just-
tryin’—to—make—it attitude to heart.

“Even before we started touring full

Political debate goes
to the mvies this fall



 by Tom VanBuren

A.1.1[Jta/ztA ea’ E Editor

Sen. Barack Obama was kind of
wrong.

“We are not as divided as our politics
suggest,” he said in his famous “Yes we
can” speech after the New Hampshire pri-
mary. Maybe, but we surely are as divided as
our political humor suggests.

Case in point: “An American Carol,”
coming to a theater near you next Friday.
All signs indicate that it’s the lamest attempt
at conservative humor since Fox News pre-
miered (and quickly canceled) “The Half
Hour News Hour,” a right—wing take on
“The Daily Show” — you can probably
guess which of the two didn’t win any Em-
mys this year.

In this Dickens—inspired tale, a Mi-
chael Moore—esque, America—hating liberal
ﬁlmmaker is visited by three spirits from
America’s past. And country music sensa-
tion Trace Adkins. Just what lesson does
the neckbeard—sport:ing protagonist have to
learn? As Adkins so delicately puts it, “This
is the greatest country in the whole wide
world.” And don’t you forget it!

I don’t think Republicans are very funny
-—— not intentionally, anyway, and I think the
“George W Bush Quotes” section of the
mall’s calendar kiosk would agree with me.
But that’s just because I’m not a Republi-
can. A conservative sense of humor might
not be any worse than a liberal one, just dif-
ferent.

Just look at Oliver Stone’s upcoming
Bush biopic, “W” Josh Brolin plays Amer-
ica’s decider himself, grabbing women’s
asses and racking up DUIS. Again, liberal
humor suggests that a Republican can be
unintentionally funny. Conservative humor
suggests that a liberal can be a “turdhea ”
— thanks, Trace Adkins! ’

“An American Carol” is perfectly indica-
tive of how divided America really is. Peo-
ple will undoubtedly see it, and people will

tit

   WWw.pitrneWS.wm    

undoubtedly laugh at the idea of lesbians
and men being physically indistinguishable
from one another. Liberals might be watch-
ing “Raisin’i McCain” on YouTube for a
good ironic laugh, but people could be jam-
ming out on their iPods to that very song
while in line for “An American Carol.”

Does our political afﬁliation really dic-
tate our sense of humor? We can only hope
—- it’s much scarier to think that it could be
the other way around. Every copy of “The
Blue Collar Comedy Tour” on DVD would
come with a “NObama” bumper sticker
and a Sarah Palin bikini calendar. The movie
theater might offer a special: Buy two tick-
ets for “\X/,” get a medium popcorn and a
smug sense of superiority for half off.

Fortunately, this isn’t the case, and
moviegoers are free to cross party lines. If
you’re positively titillated by the idea of Bill
O’Reilly bitch—slapping a Michael Moore
look—a—like in a port—a—potty, it doesn’t mean
you have to go to Obama headquarters
Downtown and turn in your hemp neck-
lace and your “Rolling Stone” subscription.
Likewise, if you’re one of those 30-ish per-
cent of Republicans who ﬁnally agree that
Bush is a tool, feel free to see “W.” I won’t
tell anyone how much you hate America.

If we’re going to unite this nation,
though, comedy is the place to start. And
no, you hippies, the answer is not for Ralph
Nader to star in his own sitcom. Less than
one percent of the country would watch it,
and they probably wouldn’t even like it, they
would just watch to make a point.

At this point, though, it could be a lost
cause. Obama said that we are one people
and one nation, but maybe that’s not true,
and America is ﬁnally so broken that we
can’t even laugh with one another anymore
—- only at one another.

But who knows. “Burn After Reading” is
still the No. 1 comedy in America, so maybe
we can all agree that Brad Pitt dancing on
a treadmill is universally amusing, and we’ll
leave it at that.

time, we’d practice seven days a week. It
was the same thing as going to work. We
made it our jobs,” said Frost.

And the tireless practicing shows —
there are few bands out there shredding
with the technical accuracy of this post-
hardcore—emo—whatever—you—want—to-
call—it outﬁt. The band combines Owens’
dramatic and high—pitched Voice with
jackhammer guitars, huge shifts in dy-
namics, a healthy serving of percussion-

heavy breakdowns and layered strings ' i

and piano for a goth—tinged rock romp.

Riding on the popularity of its debut
through a handful‘ of tours, including
a widely celebrated performance at the
2006 Bamboozle festival (“We wanted to
just kill this crowd, let them leave know-
ing that the best band to see was us,” said
Frost), Chiodos dropped Bone Pa/are Bal-
/et in the fall of 2007. To the utter shock
of the band, the record hit the charts at
No. 5. , '

So how does a band go from relative
unknowns to near-topping the charts
without any major radio or MTV pro-
motion? The simple answer that Frost
is more than willing to give is this: hard
work, touring, touring and touring. Oh
yeah, and being the best live band it can
possibly be. i

“It’s my responsibility to myself and
my band to bring 120 percent every sin-
gle night. Nowadays, there are so many
tricks you can do with computers to make
a band sound like something they’re to-
tally not. We strive away from that,” said
Frost. “The worst thing is hearing an
amazing CD, then seeing the band suck
live. If bands don’t put on a good show,
the fans are getting robbed.”

But just as the band was hitting its
stride this summer, Chiodos was side-
lined indeﬁnitely when Owens attempted
suicide in August. The singer was admit~
ted to a mental health facility and given
time to recover with the support of his

I band and friends.

“It was‘ devastating, man. The only
thing we can do for each other is be

open —~ we gotta keep this rolling. This _

is our dream together. I hope that any of

us could reach out to any others,” Frost
said. “But I don’t tell what’s going on
in my personal life to my band —— that’s
the way we are. We’re very private about
our lives —— the music and the fans, ev-
erything that we connect together is our
public domain.” ,
With Frost, there are few things more
in the public domain than his disinterest

in much of today’s music scene. Choos-
ing to skip most of his tourmates’ per-
formances, Frost will likely choose his
trusty longtime favorites over a new
MySpace band any day. And if you really
get him riled up, it’d be smart to watch
Out.

“During our last Warped Tour, I tried

Chiodos hits the stage at Mr.’ Smalls

The tiim e has come to  '        
By Drew Singer? The Pitt News spoke exclusively with representatives from four presidential campaigns about an array of issues ranging from tuition costs -
News editor

 

 

The Pitt News: What kindiof student
were you in college? - T ‘

Ralph Nader: I was No. I, what are you_

talking about? I majored in economics, far East
affairs and government.

TPN: What is your plan to respond to rising
tuition costs? ~ ’
RN: Tuition—free education, like in high
school.That's for the public schoo|s.You want
to go to Harvard? That's your business. But
what are we doing spending $80 billion in
Western ‘Asia 60 years after World War II?
Fifty-ﬁve billion dollars or so would open
the doors to the students, including many of
those soldiers who we'd bebringing home.

TPN: That's a very ambitious plan.
RN: Western Europe has had it. for 55
years. ' '

TPN: Besidesirising tuition costs, what do- .

you think is the biggest issiie affecting college
students today?

RN: Draconian gouging of student loans
payments. The problem with students is that
they don't feel it until they graduate. Then
it comes down on you.The Department of
Education should have all student loans.

TPN: Mr. Nader, why are you running for
president? '

RN: Someone has to ﬁght for whatAmericans
want, need and support, and the main parties
aren't. Most of our positions are supported
by a majority of Americans. '

TPN: If a majority of Americans support
your positions, are you happy with what the
polls are saying? ’ .

RN: We're 7 percent in Pennsylvania. The
polls would be higher, but they haven't given

us a minute on NBC and CBS.A lot of people

don't know we're running yet H A '

TPN: After collecting 55,000 signatures,
more than twice the 24,665 required, you
were able to get on the Pennsylvania ballot.
What do you think this shows about what
Pennsylvanians want out of a presidential
race? '

Ralph
Nader

Independent

Presidential Candidate

Entering ‘his seventh presidential campaign, Ralph

’ Nader has mn for office with both the Green

Party and as an Independent. Some analysts say
that by running in the 2000 election, Nader cost
Al Gore a victory in Florida, thus costing him the .
election.Aﬂer amassing more than-55,000 peti-
tion signatures, Nader will once ‘again appear on
the Pennsylvania ballot in 2008. ’ ' ‘

RN: They want uson the ballot. '

to Halloween costumes.;For more information on ‘where the candidates stand on hot-button issues, see chart, below.

TPN: Some people think that you cost Al
Gore the 2000 presidential election: When
deciding to run, do you consider the outside
consequences of your campaign?‘ '

RN: You wouldn’t'asl< a major party's can-
didate that question.That's the way_we grow
up. Our candidacy in 2000 pushed Gore
toward more popular positions, so we actu-

ally got him more votes than we costhimﬂ
Besides, every third-party candidate got more '

than the 537 votes Bush won by.

TPN: Despite those numbers, some people
think that you may cost Sen. Obama the elec-

’ tion this year: What would you say to those

people? S

RN: CNN just‘ recently showed a Florida
poll that, with just Obamaiand McCain, it
was a 48 percent-48 percent deadlock With
Obama, McCain and- myself, Obama was
winning 48-44 and I had 4 percent.We really

have to get over.it.We all have an_equal right '

to run for election. _

TPN: You were on with Triumph the Insult '

Comic Dog last week, what was it like to

meet the most famous puppet in the\coun—_

try? ’ ..
RN: I gave it as good as I got it. Presidential
politics is a theaterjof the absurd. We might
as well play a dramatic role.

TPN: On an online poll at pittnews.com,
our readers said they would rather have you,.
over any of the other candidates, pick their
Halloween costume. So,what'l| it be? '

‘RN: Superman. '

TPN: Superman? . I
' RN: Don't you know? Socialistic‘Superman

has ﬂown from D.C. to New York City to

‘ save casino capitalists on Wall Street’. who

are spewing_forth ever-growing amounts" of
kryptonite. V

TPN: You'll be speaking at Pitt on
Wednesday. What do you like to do when
you're in" town? _ ,

RN:'l like to visit the forest. I'm into trees.

 

The Pitt News: what was college life like
for you? ' ‘ ’
Howard Dean: I enjoyed college alot I

probably drank more beer than I should have, P

but I ended up in  school.

TPN: College students today are facing rising

A tuition costs, what is the Democratic party's

plan to address this concern? -

‘ ’ HD: I think it's pretty clear: We believe the
. people need a chance to go to college. Debts
are killing kids coming out of college. '

TPN: So is your focus more on getting
institutions to lower their tuition, or pro-

viding tuition assistance. to students?
HD: Tuition assistance.

TPN:’ Besides‘ rising tuition costs,
what do you think is the biggest

issue affecting college students today?
HD: The economy. job prospects. You can't

Pitt's Borza strives for perfection

Pitt senior Kristy Borza, who holds the Pitt record for career victories on the women's tennis team, is hoping for a chance in the NCAA Tournament this season.

by Tony Ferraiolo
V Senior Stgﬂ Wrder

Over the pastthree tennis sea-
sons, Pitt senior Kristy Borza has
been synonymous with Pitt history.

From the moment she arrived
on campus in 2005, no Pitt tennis
record has been safe. As a fresh-
man, Borza led the Panthers in total

victories (47) and tied school re-

cords for single—season singles and
doubles wins. Since then, Borza has
set the all—time Pitt recordlfor ca-
reer victories  143 and all-tirne
singles wins with 81.

And she still has this season to
play. .

Virtually every school record has
been challenged by the forehand of
Borza throughout her career, to the
point that almost every time she
takes the court this year she will
be attempting to break one of her

x

V

own records.

I As —Pitt’s No. 1 singles player for
the third consecutive year, Borza an-
chored a Panther team that enjoyed
one of its most suc_cessful seasons
in school history. Pitt ﬁnished 13-8
with two wins over Syracuse and
West Virginia , two teams that
Pitt had never beaten before. In de-
feating West Virginia for the second

time, the Panthersiwon two match- -

es in the Big East Tournament for
the ﬁrst time in school history, cap-
ping off a season that gave Pitt its
best—ever conference ﬁnish.

“Last year, we beat two Big ‘East
teams that we had never beaten be-
fore,” said Borza. “It was huge. All
these teams that we’ve been losing
to every year, and we pulled’ it to-
gether at the same time.”

If the Panthers continue to
progress as a team, Borza’s senior
year will be a success.

F

‘ Senior embarks on S the last year of her record-setting career at Pitt

But eminent individual goals
still loom. Despite the individual
and team triumph Borza has expe-

‘ rienced at Pitt, she remains focused

V to achieve the one goal that has
eluded her in her stint as a Panther:

I making the NCAA Tournament. '
“It has been a goal of mine ev:

ery year,” said Borza. “Since I was a

I freshman, my goal has been to go

to the NCAAS.”
The pursuit of her goal begin
 Pitt’s fall schedule. _ '
Last fall, Borza took a major
stiicle toward her ultimate goal. She
became the ﬁrst Panther to ever win

the_Women’s Eastern Collegiate In-”
‘ vitational at West Point, NY She

then advanced toithe round of 32
in the Intercollegiate Tennis As-
sociation Regional Championships
in October. In doing so, Borza
achieved another Pitt ﬁrst. She be-
came the first tennis player in the

programs 33-year history to earn an
ITA singles ranking. Borza closed
out last fall ranked 26th in the ITA
region I singles rankings. ,

Garnering a regional rank-
ing was a big' accomplishment for
Borza. But a greater target is now
in,_sight., - ‘ ’ .

Pitt coach George Dieffenbach
knows these goals well. _

“This year her goal is to earn an
ITA‘ regional and national ranking
in singles and doubles,” said Dief-
fenbach. ‘

‘The ITA is the biggest tourna-

ment of the year for Borza if she
wants to qualify for the NCAAS. A
good showing could earn her a na-
tional ranking, andif she advances
to the ﬁnals, ‘she will automatically
qualify for the NCAAS.

. In the ITA.Regional‘Champion-

iships last year, Borza got a tough
draw, and she hopes this year she‘

Ben_Fi|io / Assistant Photo Editor

will be more fortunate. Borza

knows that a strong showing in the
ITA this year will elevate her chanc-
es of making it to the NCAAS.
“Last year I played a  from
William and Mary who was top—ﬁve
in the nation,” said Borza. “It was a
bad draw to get second round, but
that’s why you go to Pitt, so you can
play top [players] in the nation. If I
get a good draw this year, it's deﬁ-
nitely a realistic goal.” V ‘
Unlike Pitt’s spring schedule,
which consists primarily of Big East
competition and team matches, the
fall affords Borzathe opportunity
to play in various invitational" tour-
naments like the ITA, which will
present more ranked opponents for
Borza. Beating ranked" opponents
will help Borza garner a national
ranking herself and heighten her
chances of making the NCAAS.
“We play a couple [ranked play-

Men's Soccer

Pitt stri

by Sergei F eldman
Staff WrL'ter

The intensity at Founders Field
Friday evening was tangible, as the
Pitt men’s soccer team prepared to
square off against 20th-ranked Rut-
gets.

The Panthers pulled off the up-
set: a 1-0 shutout victory thanks to
senior forward  McCorrnick’s
late-game heroics, breeding cred-
ibility to the team’s best start in years
and giving Pitt its first win in confer-
ence play.

But Pitt (5-2-1) couldn’t keep the
momentum going Sunday, dropping
a 1-0 decision to Villanova in double
overtime.

Pitt 1, Rutgers 0

It took just more than 84 minutes
for the scoreboard to participate in
the evening’s activity, when McCor-
mick iiﬂed a shot to the far left cor-
ner after contesting and controlling a
loose ball around the Rutgers goal.

Pitt faithful cheered in an uproar,

es late, upsets N o. 20 Rutgrs in Q

as the Panthers capped off a night
of domination that began at kickoff.

Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher said he
was proud of his team’s play.

“This was really a gutsy, hard-
fought win for our guys,” said Lux-
bacher. “I’m proud of them.”

The Panthers attacked Rutgers
hard, fighting for every loose ball
and getting in the Rutgers’ players’
faces on every possession.

Equally as noticeable was Pitt’s
offensive play, which has been the
team’s Achilles heel.

Pitt opened the game by generat-
ing a multitude of scoring chances in
every which way,  the corner
kick battle 5-2 and outshooting the
men in red 9-5 in the first half.

Everything appeared to be
working in Pitt’s favor until Rutgers
forward Gaetano Panuccio stood
point-blank in front of Pitt’s goal
and unleashed a powerﬁil strike that
sailed just inches wide.

The near goal ended Pitt’s invin-
cibility and gave Rutgers the much-
needed momentum heading into the

second half.

Pitt looked slightly less sure of it-
self in the second half but equally as
determined, as Rutgers went on the
offensive, outshooting the Panthers
5-2 and  three corner kicks to
the Panthers’ two.

But it was Pitt’s defensive play,
which has been the signature of the
team thus far this season, coupled
with timely saves, that enabled Pitt to
compete.

“Our defense has played really

' well this season, and we needed that

to be the case here again,” said Lux-
bacher.

An evening ﬁlled with emotions
and expectations for the Panthers
turned into a night of heartache for
the Rutgers Scarlet  when
McCormick put the ball in the back
of the net and sent Rutgers back
home.

Yankee Stadium holds

more than just records  

by Adam Littman
Senior Stzzﬂ [Writer

 

The last game ever played at Yankee _~;?

Stadium took place on Sunday. As-a native
New Yorker and lifelong Yankee fan, I feel
as though I have to eulogize the stadium
.a little bit, because clearly not enough has
been made of the event.

I apologize for the self-indulgence that‘ "

is to come, as I attempt to pour out a 356.50
commemorative cup of soda in Yankee Sta-
dium’s honor, but I just have to do it.

The reason Yankee Stadium is getting
this big send—off is of course because of its
history. It’s where Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig,
Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle played.
It’s where Jackie Robinson and Willie Mays
visited as opposing players. But then again,
it’s not.

The Stadium was built in 1923, but un-
derwent some serious renovation in 1974-
75 and reopened in ’76. It’s the same body
skeleton, but looks much different, kind of
like a woman who had a lot of plastic sur-
gery and would have a show on “E!”

So it’s not quite where Gehrig gave his
famous “Luckiest Man” speech or where
Don Larsen pitched the only perfect game
in World Series history. But it is where Reg-
gie Jackson hit three home runs in Game 6
of the 1977 World Series. It’s where the Red
Sox capped the greatest comeback in sports
history by winning Game 7 of the 2004
American League Championship Series af-
ter traiiing 3-0 in the best—of—seven series.

And while those moments are great, ex-
cluding that last one, they aren’t why,I’ll per-
sonally miss Yankee Stadium. No, I’ll miss
Basebal1’s Cathedral, as it’s referred to, be-
cause of all I’ve learned in my years going to
Yankee games, which is possibly more than

I’ve learned in another certain cathedral.

I learned that sometimes it’s OK to skip
school if there’s a good reason. On April
11, 1997, my family and I had one as we
braved the cold, collectively missing work
and school, to see the Yankees’ home open-
er against the Oakland A’s. All I remember is
they lost, and Mark McGwire demolished a
pitch by Mariano Rivera into the black seats
in dead center field.

I learned how to properly keep score of
a baseball game and, consequently, how little
I enjoy keeping score while trying to watch
baseball games. I learned that it is true that
money can buy happiness, just as long as the
money is spent on the right free agents.

A friend’s father taught us that if you
start chanting around drunken people,
there’s a good chance they’ ll chant along. He
demonstrated by starting a “Seattle sucks”
chant late in a game against the Mariners,
even though they were winning by double-
digits. Sure enough, three drunken men be-
hind us joined in and kept the chant going
for the next couple of minutes.

Besides the lessons, I’Ve seen monumen-
tal moments in a person’s life occur at the
stadium. My brother lost his first tooth at
a Yankee game and earned congratulations
from the majority of our section.

I’ve even seen new lives start.

At a game a few years ago, when a wed-
ding proposal popped up on the big screen,
many people in my section customar-
ily yelled, “No, don’t do it!” only to grow
embarrassed when they noticed the now
engaged couple was sitting in that same sec-
tion. They made up for it with a standing
ovation, though.

And I’ve seen lives nearly end.

On a camp trip one summer, we were
ﬁling out of the upper deck. We occupied a

few rows, and a person in the row
behind mine was joking around
with his friend, who happened to,
be right in front of me. The kid
in the back row pushed his friend,
sending him tumbling over our
row. He continued rolling over
the tops of seats as we stood there
wondering if he would just keep
tumbling until he fell over and
most likely died. \X/ell, I was won-
dering that. He didn’t. He rolled
about six rows and stopped.

My last trip to Yankee Sta-
dium came on Aug. 17 this year.
The Yankees defeated the Royals,
15-6. I remember not wanting to
leave and just not being able to.
Of course, like any Yankee game,
that was mostly because of the
sticky floor and post—game con-
gestion as everyone tries to leave
at once, but they shut down cer-
tain walkways to make sure ev-
eryone leaves from the same few
exits.

I like to think it was also partly
because of how I felt about the

place. I’ve been to a few other
ballparks, but none compare. I’ve
seen the beautiful Camden Yards
and been brought to tears at Fen-
way Park after a roughly 10-yearw
old me wore a Yankee hat on a
tour of the stadium and was in-
sulted by Red Sox fans more than
twice my age.

There are nicer looking stadi-
ums and stadiums in better neigh-
borhoods. But they still don’t
compare to the history. The new
Yankee Stadium won’t compare,
either.

They can move all the monu-
ments and retired numbers and’!
put up “Yankee Stadium” in huge,
blue lettering on the building. But
it won’t matter.

There’s no way it will be the
same. I mean, it’ll take at least a
few years for the new stadium to
even get close to the smell of the
current one.

And even more so than that, it
won’t be the same stadium where
I learned to love baseball.

After upset, injuries plague Pitt against tough 'Nova team

Soccer, page 13
jured players, all of whom have been critical to

‘ the team’s success.

And while for much of the season the resil-
ient bunch has been able to overcome its 
plague, Pitt struggled Sunday.

“The effort was there, and we played smart,

V. but we’re just beat up and tired right now,” said
1 Luxbacher.

The fatigue was prevalent from the out-
set, as Pitt could not generate a good scoring
chance the entire game.

Maybe its best chance came midway through

that caught nothing but goalkeeper.

And with the energy  certainly sub—par
offensively, it was the defense that  kept
Pitt in the game for more than 100 minutes of
playing time

“Our defense played great today, but you
have to score some goals and we’re not doing
that,” said Luxbacher.

The loss evens Pitt’s Big East record at
1-1-0, and heading into a stretch of critical
conference games, the challenge becomes
much greater from here.

These teams are really good and tough. But
we know that coming in, and we have to work
through it,” said Luxbacher.

- After two scoreless halves and overtime,
both teams appeared to be heading for a tie.
But a sound of a whistle changed the fates of
the respective teams, as Villanova was awarded
an indirect kick, which led to forward Adam
Brazitis’ game—winning tally in the 101 st min-
ute.

Villanova forward Danny DeMasters shot
a ball through a Pitt wall, which deflected off

the first half on a longjoe P1ince—V(/right blast

ball and kicked in the game winner. _

“I thought it was a questionable call there at
the end,” said Luxbacher. “And then the indi-
rect kick hit our guy. Just bad luck [that] didn’t
go our way.”

The Panthers came second in all categories,
losing both the shooting (outshot 15-7) and
corner kick (5-4) battles. But the biggest loss
appeared in the score.

“We had three points sitting there and
couldn’t pick up one,” said Luxbacher.

Pitt will get its chance at redemption next
week against South Florida.

Borza leads
Panthers for
fourth year

Borza, page 12

ers] in the spring, “ said Borza. “But there are
more chances in the fall, because there are
random tournaments with random players in-
stead of just the No. 1 player of each school.

“Wins in the ITA are your most important
wins in terms of ranking. If you get ranked re-
gionally, its ’cause you beat regionally ranked
players. If you play at the ITA, you have the
chance to play nationally ranked players. Then
you have the chance to get nationally ranked,
which would be ideal.”

Borza also has the opportunity to achieve
her goal in doubles. Last season she teamed
with partner Elizabeth Adams and went 16-4
as Pitt’s top doubles team. Adams’ game com-
plements Borza’s perfectly, and with a year of
experience playing with each other, Borza and
Adams have the potential to  a ranking in
doubles, as well.

“Elizabeth is a great doubles partner,”
said Borza. “We’re similar in that we’re both
really aggressive. She can cover a lot of the
court, which makes up for me being short
in doubles. She can come to the net, but the
thing with Elizabeth is [that she has] a lot of
power.”

Despite all her success, Borza said she real-
izes she can still get better, and there are some
goals that she has yet to obtain.

“I didn’t have a perfect season last year,”
said Borza. “There’s deﬁnitely room to im-
prove from last season. I would like to get
ranked, that’s one thing that I’ve been trying
to do.”

Each year at Pitt, Borza has accomplished
lsomething remarkable. This fall marks the be-
 of the end of Borza’s celebrated ca-
leer as a Panther. And if the ending is perfect,
it will mark the beginning of her march to the
NCAA Tournament, as well.
