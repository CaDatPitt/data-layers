Radiation Controversy Three Area

Sets Off Heated Debate

4”

. BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Disagreements on the danger
of drinking the Pennsylvania milk
contaminated by this weekend’s
fallout sparked a heated debate
between three Pitt professors
following their back-to-back press
conferences yesterday morning.

Originally Pitt professors Ernest
Sternglass and Frederick Gottlieb
were to hold a press conference on
the dangers posed by the contam-
inated milk to young and unborn
children to be followed by a press
conference by Pitt professor
Bernard L. Cohen, who maintains
the radiation presents no significant
health -concern.

The two press conferences broke
down into a heated confrontation
between the two opposing parties
when Sternglass and Gottlieb
demanded a chance to rebut
Cohen’s_ commentary. ' ‘

Pennsylvania health officials
have continued to report the
contaminated milk is safe for
consumption and the level ‘of

. radiation is insigniﬁcant.

In their prepared ‘statements,
Stern glass and Gottlieb emphasized
the radioactive iodine isotope found
in some Pennsylvania milk supplies
presented an “avoidable risk.”

Sternglass cited new studies on
the effects of low-level radiation as
reason for action by state ofﬁcials,
particularly calling for people to
avoid drinking fresh milk and for-
farmers to put their dairy herd on

stored feed, which hadnot been
exosed to the fallout.

“There’s a contradiction in the
way the government is handling this
information, ’ ’ Gottlieb said after his
speech. “We took cyclamates off
the market because some tests
indicated, and only indicated, mind
you, that the chemicals might cause
cancer.

“Now with the radioactive
elements in this milk, we have a
known cancer-causing agent, iodine
131, _ and the state ofﬁcials are
saying there is no risk at all.”

Gottlieb said published research

Two Oakland residents, one of
them a graduate student in Pitt’s
School of Education, were raped
early ‘Wednesday morning in their
North Craig Streetapartment.

Another graduate student in the
School of Education was raped
Monday evening after being
abducted at gunpoint near Magee
Women's Hospital.

A detective with the Pittsburgh
police youth and sex squad said
yesterday that “investigations are
continuing” in each case, adding
that rapes apparently run in series
and that ‘ ‘there probably will be one
or two more (rapes in Oakland)
before we can come up with
anything deﬁnite.”

In both incidents, two men
reportedly were ‘involved. How-
ever, a faculty member in the School
of Education who said “I was with
them (the students) throughout the
police investigations” said she did
not believe the same men were
involved in the two incidents. I

In the first incident, the student
was reportedly abducted at gun-
point near the hospital at approxi-
mately 8 p.m. and raped before
being released in East Liberty.

In Wednesday’s incident, two
men reportedly forced their way
into an apartment on the 300 block
of North Craig at approximately 2
a.m. and raped both occupants. '

She also said the incident could

 Communist Hopeful Speaks

BY MREA CSORBA

The Communist Party presiden-
tial candidate Gus Hall said
Wednesday’s Ford-Carter debate
was won by Ronald Reagan on the
Panama issue, Karl Marx on
economicsand by the Pentagon on
the arms issue. _

During the press conference at

the‘Downtown YMCA yesterday a

Hall called the debate‘ “empty”

with platitudes and demagoguery

sweeping most of the issues.

The two-time presidential candi-
date said his party’s platform calls
for a six—hour work day at regular
eight-hour pay with no overtime
extended to make jobs for the 10
million now unemployed. ‘

The pla_tform'also calls for new
schools and hospitals to be built in
cities, “not just in the neighbor-
hoods surrounding them.’

“Cities are fast becoming
conglomerate slums,” Hall said.

“Correct Outlet" Q

BYDEANNALOUISE

In the wake of Student Govern-
ment Board President Barry
Weisband’s report that student
participation in top-level budget
hearings has been ruled out by the
senior staff, Vice Chancellor of
Planning and Budget Jack Freeman
has said it is not a matter of
“rejecting student participation,
but of ﬁnding the correct outlet for
it.” '

Weisband said Chancellor Wes-
ley Posvar is sending a letter of
support to individual schools for
student representation on school
budget committees, which was

proposed by the senior staff last '

week.

He would be willing, Weisband
said, to have representatives sit on
school budget committees, but he
wants students involved in all facets
of the budgetary process and still
would like to see representatives on
the senior staff.

In rejecting student input at the

tion discussed is not secretive, much
of it is delicate.”

Freeman explained the senior
staff, which includes the Chancellor,
president of the University Senate,
Chairman of the Budget Policies
Committee of the Senate, School
deans, the Provost and Freeman,
meets privately to discuss ‘ ‘the nitty
gritty” of what’s happening in each
school, which amounts to very
‘ ‘ sensitive ’ ’ material.

“Furthermore,” Freeman said,
“if the meeting would become
public other private ones would have
to be scheduled." ‘ '~ '

“They also "claimed the student .

Though Freeman did not mention . _ —- 

the last statement by Weisband as a

reason for the staff’s rejection of ,

student participationat the top level,

he did say the student’s presence

would not contribute to the quality of
the discussion, as students would

have lack of budgetary experience
and research time.

“The student at top-level,meet-
ings would have to do much
research, reading hundreds of pages
of data and sacriﬁce more time than

He added. ‘ ‘The student does not V

Weisband said the Board will be
contacting the respective University
schools on ways to select students
for their budget committees.

On another issue, Weisband
quoted a letter from Associate
Student Activities Director Terry
Milani listing, in an administrative
about-face, 17 campus locations

‘there distribution of campaign
leaﬂets will now be permitted.

Coming under fire by the
Pittsburgh chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union and campus
political groups for its ban on
political canvassing on University
property, the administration bowed

to public demands, yetrestated its .

policy that “University funds,
facilities or services may not be
used for any participation or
intervention in a political campaign
071 behalf of any candidate for public
office.”

1‘ Weisband also reported that
Chancellor Posvar rescinded the
Communication Center’s new
policy of charging student groups
for the use of audio-visual
equipment. Audio-visual delivery
and projectionist services, how-
ever, will be assessed a fee. The
announcement came at Monday’s
Student Affairs Advisory Council
nleeting, he said, and was the result

 Board member Chip Hubbard’s

meeting with various University
officials.

The Board approved allocations
for the National Speech and
Hearing Association and the Third
World Peoples Coalition, but after
prolonged debate and several
motions, the Allocations Commit-
tee’s recommendation to deny the
Interfraternity Council (IFC) $800
for a community dinner still is
pending. «

“The situation with the fraterni-
ties and the community has
deteriorated so much,” Allocations
representative Dave Hesidence
said, “that dinner is not going to
matter. When someone’s about to
hit you with a lawsuit, food's not
going to make them listen.”

IFC spokesman Ezra Krieg
denied the fraternities were using
the dinner as a response to
community problems.

“We just want, to create a
dialogue between fraternity stu-
dents and their neighbors,” he
said. “We don’t see any framework
put together by Student Govern-
ment or anyone else for community
dialogue, so we’d like to do it
ourselves.”

In other committee business
Board member Gary Tweed ques-
tioned the need for the Public
Relations Committee saying, “Stu-
dents won’t sign up for a committee
when all it does is hang up signs.”

I

had begun to indicate low-level
radiation affects the cellular
membrances and enzymeactivities,
while high-level radiation damages
chromosomes.

Sternglass is a member of Pitt’s
radiology department and a contro-
versial figure in the debate over the
dangers of radioactivity. Gottlieb is
a geneticist in Pitt’s life sciences
department.

.In his statement following
Sternglass and Gottlieb, Cohen
reiterated statements made earlier
this week that the risk from the
contaminated milk was insignifi-
cant.

Children drinking the contamina-
ted milk would be subjected to the
same danger as they might face
from a stay of five days in Colorado
(Colorado having a higher natural
radiation background than‘;A_l’eg_iI1‘sy-
lvania), "Cohen said.  .. 

“My point is simply to getithe
figures straight on this tissue,”
Cohen said. “If you’re going to
worry about the levels of radiation
in this milk, you should be just as
concerned about people living in

 

‘Cohen complained later.

Colorado, or in brick houses, which
have more natural radiation than
wooden ones.”

Cohen had no exlanation for state
health warnings to wash garden
vegetables, while at the same time
announcing that the milk supply
presented no danger.

Government and scientific panels
that participated in setting the
standards for levels of acceptable
radiation in food supplies indicated
that the present levels posed no
threat to people, Cohen stated.

The clash between Sternglass and
Gottlieb and Cohen centered on the
validity of statistical approaches to
the danger presented by radiation
at any level. Cohen repeatedly said
he was unfamiliar with the new
research presented by‘ Sternglass
and Gottlieb and thus could not
comment on the accuracy of their
analysis.

“He's done this to me before,”
“He
always comes up with some new
report or other that I've never heard
of."

Sternglass suggested that Co-
hen’s refusal to support stricter

warning levels in radiation-contam-
inated foods stemmed from his
involvement with the so-called
nuclear establishment.

“His research is supported by a
$ 1' million grant from the
government in nuclear energy,I’
Sternglass said. “He quotes a
scientific society where nine out of
10 past presidents were involved
with the nuclear establishment,
either in government or private
circles.

“Of course he doesn’t go along
with my ﬁndings, he wants to play
up the beneﬁts of the atom, not the
dangers." ‘

Cohen admitted he had a bias in
favor of nuclear research and
development.

“Yes, I’m pro-atomic,” Cohen
said. “But in the middle
somewhere whereas Sternglass is
on the fringe of the anti-atom
groups. He's unique, he's famous
in fact for his position."

“If you’re so concerned about
radiation,” Cohen told Stemglass
at one point in their exchange,
“why don’t you crawl into one of
those cannons in front of the
Soldiers and Sailors‘ Memorial?"

The Strike ls Imminent

Like the sword of Damocles, the threat of a Campus Police Strike
hangs over the heads of Pitt students and staff. Already  
starting to drift around camP“5 ab°“t the quality Of PY°t°°“°n the my
police will provide should a walkout occur. .

Negotiations have dragged on for a week since the strike vote was
taken with neither party commenting on progress made. _The police
have promised not to strike until negotiations reach a standstill. This is a
situation the University should take advantage of. .

Instead, negotiations drag on. Little is accomplished at sessions,
including one on Sept.’ 29 when Pitt Labor Relations Manager Tom
Cherry walked out and did not return until the next meeting. Whether
Cherry was right or wrong in that particular disagreement, walking out
is no way to accomplish anything in a bargainlilg 535510“-

There is no doubt that the police would strike if negotiations stop, they
have already voted to do so, 52-3. A strike is a legal and workable tool to
force management into taking bargaining sessions a little more

seriously.

A strike hurts the community. Everyone lmows how necessary the
Campus Police are to Pitt, so it is essential that the decision to strike be

made as a last alternative.

' Unless the pace of negotiations pick

Police strike, one that could have been avoided. The.Univer§ity. as a

._ the ppm; Guards union, it had better start proving it. Pitt had better

start coming to the bargaining sessions ready to offer proposals In line

with what the union wants. Or else realisticallytry to convince them why
certain union proposals may not be feasible. _

The diﬁerences are not so great that they cannot be settled quickly.

But if not settled soon they will spawn a potentially dangerous situation

on campus.

Make a Gift Tomorrow

In an urban area such as Allegheny County there are many social
problems that require time, energy and money to solve. The social
service agencies working on these problems require donations from the
community in order to survive from day to day. Donation money is

  Cow's Letter
Prompts Shame

It is a matter of collective
embarrassment when a school of

the University sponsors such a
course as the one advertised thus in

an SGS brochure:

Darker Side of the Supernatural
Five Mondays, Sept. 27 - Oct. 25,
6:30_ - 8 p.m.

Nothing has been more puzzling
throughout the history of human
relationships than “man’s inhu-
manity to man.” How can one

account for cruelty, brutality,

warfare, insensitivity? Are there,
indeed, forces external to people or
within them that cannot be c
controlled? Lectures willciiver,’ but
not be limited to, concepts of
witchcraft, history of the devil, and
related. topics. No texts, but»
supplemental readings will be
suggested by an authority who has a
long standing avocational interest
in all aspects of the supernatural,
Dr. Robert Nossen, Associate

—One in every four persons in

Allegheny County beneﬁts directly '

from United Way services each
year; everyone" in the community;
‘benefits in the long-run. T J
--By using volunteers, the
United Way channels 92% of the
money it collects directly to
community agencies; only 8% is
used to cover administrative costs.

We could go on, but you get the
idea: United Way gives a

.. tremendous return on your volun-
teer dollar. You, your university,
your family and community are
benefiting from United Way
agencies all year round, probably
without your even beign aware of
it. It's time you joined in-

We conduct‘ the ' University’s
Annual Giving  Campaign at
the same time as the UW drive for
two good reasons: to cut down on
the expenses in time and money of
running two separate campaigns;
and to enable you to evaluate how
big a chunk of > your available
charitable dollars for 1976 these
two important causes merit. We
believe that both are of major
importanct. ,

Some facts about the AGF:

Such embarrassment was ex-
pressed by the letter printed in the
Oct. 4 edition of the Pitt News and
signed by the “Pittsburgh Eleven”
of whom I was one. That letter
elicited a response from Steele
Gow, dean of SGS, which appeared
in the Oct. 6 edition.

Whereas the course description
prompted only embarrassment,
Dean Gow’s letter prompts shame.

Dean Gow did not disavow the
course_description, so I assume that
his “hasty investigation” conﬁrm-
ed“ that SGS practices truth in
advertising, i.e. that the course
conformed reasonably closely to its
description. One might have
expected an academic dean to share
our embarrassment, perhaps even
to offer a red-faced apology for SGS
sponsorship of such rubbish. Dean
Gow, however, chose to make a joke
of the matter, perhaps hoping
therebyto divert attention from the
issue of intellectual corruption.
Worse, he sought to insinuate that

- there are no intellectual standards

by which courses on Greek
mythology or tribal anthropology
might be set off from the one
described in the SGS brochure.

Torre Blasts News Practices Sukkah 
  Jewish Harvest F   ° 

BY DEAN NA LOUISE

Editors who hire unqualiﬁed
anchormen and reporters breed
incompetence in the ranks of
braodcast and newspaper journal-
ism, according to Marie Torre,
former host of KDKA’s The Marie
Torre Show.

“New reporters are a pain in the

neck sometimes and irresponsible,‘

but it’s the editor’s_ fault for hiring
them,” Torre said yesterday when

Point Park College President Dr..

John Hopkins presented her with a
plaque commemorating her service
in developing the college's joumal-
ism and communications depart-
ment. This was also one of Torre’s
last appearances as a Pittsburgh
journalist.

Torre recently quit her job at
KDKA and plans to return to her

_native New York. Her duties there
included co-anchoring the noon ..

newscast as well as general news
reporting and her regular daily
show.

Torre related an incident when

.Washington Post Editor'Ben

Bradlee hired a young woman

-named Sally Quinn during her job.

interview to ﬁll the position of
society ‘editor because he was
"impressed with her credentials.”

As she was leaving his office

Bradlee asked her, “What’s your 1

writing like?” v
“I’ve never written an article in

. my life, ’ ’ she said.

“Good projection and appear-
ance are the only measured criteria
for television jobs. The people who"
hire them don’t have news in their
background either,” Torre said.

Torre said some news personali-
ties are so imbued with their facade

they have no time to cover news. 

‘ ‘Anchorpéople don’t learn about
news. Usually they’re just actors

and readers,” Torre said. “These

people never reach their full
potential as journalists because the
learning -process stops... . »
Coiiiimentiing on ethics in joumal-

reading and an article inconsistent
with the magazine’s image.”

Torre also addressed the allegati-
on that intemal conﬂict at KDKA
caused several television personali-
ties recently to quit the station.

“Steve Smith wasn’t crazy about
the present management and
personally unhappy with his job,”
she said., “Tom Perkins was

ago and my two children are away at

Torre added that she prefers
one-hour indepth interviews on
television as opposed to the
ten-minute stints she was doing on
The Marie Torre Show.

lndepth interviews are remini-
scent of Torre’s years as a reporter‘
on the New York World Telegram
and later the Herald Tribune. 5

Torre emphasized there is a large
turnover "of jobs in all facets of
television production.

“There’s an inside joke among
television reporters,” Torre said,
“If my boss calls back while I’m
gone, get his name.”

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

A sukkah now sits in the middle of
the Student Union lawn facing the
Cathedral of Learning. It was built
yesterday by the Pitt Hillel Club,
both to celebrate the eight-day
harvest festival of Succot and to give
Pitt students‘ a chance to relate the
Jewish experience to every day life.

The sukkah resembles a sort of
blue and yellow tent with burgundy
lettering adorning its sides.

“Hillel is attempting to reach out
to the Jewish students at Pitt to help
them understand and enjoy their
Jewish identity,” Rich Goldberg,
assistant program director of Hillel,
said. “We will be planning social
and cultural events to help make it
easier to relate to their heritage.”
. A sukkahis traditionally made of
wood and palm and consists of four
walls with no roof. If has no nails
holding it together either. Hillel
Club members, however, had to
improvise as wood and palm are
scarce commodities in Oakland.
Their Sukkah consists of a metal
beam structure with a tent spread
around the beams. About 15
members assembled the structure,
barely ﬁnishing before‘ a late
afternoon cloudburst hit.‘

considered ﬂashy attire for the then irregularly attended event. Now my
(clean) blue jeans rubbed guiltily past pastel lime, silk dresses as I made
my way to a seat.

A’ spotlighted, dark-suited man was framed by the vast white
backdrop, its awesome curve broken only by the hanging gold poetry
emblem. Seated a few feet from him was Hazo’s guitarist
accompaniment. The audience sat in well-delineated rows six feet below
the stage. -

Yes, Hazo’s poetry is classically oriented. And it was the Forum’s
opening night. And Pittsburghers have earned the rightto celebrate in
style the ﬁne poetry institute they, coordinated by Hazo, have achieved
over the past 11 years. But it is at the expense of unfettered, easy
communication between poet and audience. '

In the Age of the Enlightenment, 18th Century newly invented novels
hit the presses. And after that, it was only the fresh breath of the’:
Romantic poets that could coax-the plebeian tastes of the newly formed ._
middle class to read poetry again.

And poetry was all the better for it. “Ordinary folks” could feel the
emotional charge of John Keats’ poems without a church schooling.
Little children as well as adults with child-like minds could understand
the philosophical truths of Odgen Nash. And the modern age is perfectly
spoken for by Lawrence Ferlenghetti with 10 cent words that is in
keeping with our non-frill culture.

To it’s credit, the art of poetry is now inﬁltrated into common use by
common people who communicate with themselves on lonely or happy
nights in comfortable free verse. _ '

I left Wednesday night’s poetryireading session disturbed, feeling

Syria Mosque Tuesday night.

There are many admirable
aspects in Raisin. The company
billed several excellent actors and
actresses, including Virginia
Capers who received the best
actress-Tony award for Raisin. The
musical talent for both song and
dance is of top quality.

Raisin, based on A Raisin In The
Sun by Lorraine Hansberry, takes
place on the south side of Chicago
duringthe 1950s. It involves a
hard-pressed black working class
family that wants to move up the
social ladder and out of the
neighborhood.

The mother envisions the family
moving into a private home in-a
better section of town—a hope
which appears within their reach
after receiving a $10,000 insurance

check. However, racial discrimina-

tion keeps the family from their new
home. _
Virginia Capers, Gregg Baker,

tVanessa Shaw and Arnetia Walker

stormed onstage in redneck duds,
(faded Levis, plaid ﬂannel shirts
under silk vests, Cowboy boots and
hats), charged into “Stick Around
For Rock N’ Roll,” and instantly
had the young, frisky crowd out of
their seats, boogiein’ and howlin’
with joy.

Their presence was commanding,

‘with their stage show light on the

theatrics, but heavy on long,
lightning-fast guitar jams.
Hughie Thommason and Billy
Jones, the Outlaws dual lead
guitarists, have distinct, yet
compatible guitar styles. The burly
and bushy-haired Thommason has a
raw, searing sound, while the frail,

walrus-mustached Jones style is

. more fluid, bordering on blue grass.

Their ability to blend is essential
to the Outlaw’s music with so many
of the songs delivered at_ break-neck
speed. If Thommason or Jones
were just a wee bit sloppy, the
driving, clear Outlaw guitar trade-
mark would come across like river

picksup and hits the senses with the
force of a blitzkrieg assault.

Thommason, Jones, rythym gui-
tarist Henry Paiil, and bassist Frank
O’Keefe assembled in a quadrangle
formation on the second encore
tune, “There Goes Another Logg
Song,” and let the guitars wail.
Once again the playing was tight“,
and brilliant.

-The Ozark Mountain. Daredevils
were second billed to the Outlaws
and proved one thing if nothing
else: they are one of the most
unusual bands in rock n’ roll. The
nine members look more like
misplaced farmers instead of the
talented professional musicians
they proved to be.

Rockers (“Noah,” “If You Wﬁgait
To Get To Heaven,” and ballaél
(“You Know Like I Know,” and
“Jackie Blue’T) showed this moun-
rain band’s ability to change tempo
without losing impact.

. The Ozark Mountamsoy

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

Ozark Mountain Daredevil is a
down-home band with its keyboard
player, Buddy Brayﬁeld, an Ozark
mountain farm boy who would
rather be back home in the Ozarks
with the wife. kids and cow.

What’s he doing under bright
sﬁige lights enjoying the favors of
amorous groupies? '

playing a bill with the Outlaws and
Buckacre at the Stanley Theatre.

The Daredevils emerged from
obscurity in 1974 with an immediate
AM hit “If You Want To Get To
Heaven" from their first album and
followed that up with the lush ballad
“Jackie Blue."

"We were really lucky to have ‘If
You Want to Get to Heaven’ break
so big. It helped establish our

“Man, we’ve toured all over
Europe. France, England, Norway
and Scotland. In fact...in Scotland
they know our material better than
in a lot of the cities on the Eastern
seaboard. They hoot n’ holler for
what they wanna’ hear, and we play
it." Brayﬁeld said.

The band has had to carry on
without former head honcho,
guitarist and vocalist Randell

  

The Ozark Mountain Daredevils

“We’re on- the road touring to

‘ make enough money to invest in

larger tracts of land’. I’d much
rather be back home. We’re really
farm boys at heart,” Brayﬁeld said.

But no matter how much
Brayﬁeld loves his serene existence

credibility as recordingiartists and
national tourin’ became possible. It
was real nice,” Brayﬁeld said in his
soft Ozark twang.

I was surprised to hear how
popular the band is in Europe.

with a combination of love and
strength.

Gregg Baker is Walter Lee, her
son. who has to learn the hard way
from his mistakes and disagree-
ments with mother. Darren Green
plays Travis. the pre-teen. youngest
family member. He steals the
audience’s attention several times
with his cute behavior. Green not
only acts his part well, but he also
sings one of the best songs
——“Sidewalk Tree”+in the show.

Diector-choreographer ‘Donald
McKayle takes advantage of a
talented cast and adds the‘ use of
mime in developing the characters.
The hand motions the actors use
centering and leaving through an
invisible door and their reactions to
one another are clever. Their mime
is effective in sparking instant
laughter from the audience.

Chorus «numbers highlighted the
musical score. The African dance,
the church scene and several other
scenes displayed some ﬁne danc-
ing, adding a change of pace when it
was needed most.

Perhaps the-only- fault in Raisin is
the similarity the show has to other

musicals. The theme of a family

trying to survive or stay together.  

under the worst conditions is found
in the shows Fiddler On The Roof
and Shenandoah. i_

In those shows; the musical score
helped deliver the message by .
creating a more dramatic environ-
ment. Though Raisin does not lack '
decent music, the score in general"
does not enhance the theme of the
play. Raisin appears to rely mostly
on the book script and the ability of
the actors‘ to build its story.

The scenery for Raisin is a‘

simple, single setting of a family
house with a few prop tables and
chairs. Other areas of the stage
represent the neighborhood sur-
roundings with a" backdrop that.

conveys the side of a red brick '~ ii’

building.

The set is geared for a fast
moving show. There are no walls,
doors or boundaries that separate
the house from other stage areas.
Nor are there many props,- which is
why mime is used heavily. How-
ever, the action moves , cleanly
without any problems._

back home, touring is the lifeblood

of ‘almost all rock n’ roll bands. So,

the Ozark Mountain Daredevils

were found last Tuesday night

BY STEVE SYBERT
Sports Editor

It’s funny how the Louisville
Cardinals got on the Pitt schedule in
the ﬁrst place. Temple would beat
them handily; Notre Dame would
annihilate them. But sometime
back when the Panthers were
struggling along at 1-10, they
decided to give Louisville this
one-time shot. And little did the
Cardinals know Pitt would be where
it is today.

After Saturday is over and the
Panthers have displayed the rebirth
of an Eastern football power to an
opponent which itself went 1-10 last
season, Louisville may be_ mighty
glad they won’t soon appear again
on the Pitt schedule.

Louisville coach Vince Gibson,
who joked with reporters - via
telephone hookup at the Panthers
weekly media luncheon on Tuesday,
won’t have a chance for any
one-liners on Saturday as his team
has been labeled 30-point under-
dogs to the 4-0 and number two
(both AP and UPI polls) Panthers.

“Pitt is a great team, great
team,” Gibson said respectfully. “I
don’t know if we're ready for a
football team this good, but we’re
going to have to ﬁnd out. I think
we’ll be enthusiastic and we’ll be
aggressive. But, let’s face it, we
don’t have the same kind of talent
that Pitt has.”

Pitt will be the highest-ranked
team Louisville has ever played.
The Cardinals themselves are not
unfamiliar with the national rank-
ings as they ﬁnished 9-1 in 1972 and
16th in the UPI poll and 17th in the
AP.

But now Louisville is rebuilding
and this week should be a major
setback to their program.

Heading the Cardinals, 2-1 this
season with wins over Drake and
Wichita State, with a loss to
Mississippi State, is tailback Calvin
Prince,  %tion’s‘_.;g,leading scorer

ivftt Offensive, Wins 3-2 \

$7-?~ '

BY MARK MURPHY

It is well known that offensive
power has been the main problem

with.the Pitt soccer team. So_ you

would have expected Wednesday

night's matchup at Pitt Stadium.

with Gannon College to be a low
scoring affair, especially -with the

absence‘ of Rick ~Roic<_:on,”one‘ of they
.'Panther’s ‘main scoring. assets,

right? Wrong. Very wrong.
Picking up two goals from

sophomore Marty _ Moyer and a '

third from Fred Dohrmann, and
--employing what coach Leo Bemis
called “our best teamwork,” the
Panthers disposed of their visitors
3-2. '

n “This was the nicest we've
worked," Bemis said. “Our
teamwork reached a high tonight.
We played the kind of soccer we
like to play here. We put the ball
down and went.”

Dohrmann hit first for the
Panthers, tying the score just‘
minutes after Gannon had taken
the lead on a successful penalty
shot. Tom Murphy picked up an
assist on the goal.

Later in the half Moyer tallied
two times within 13 minutes to put
the Panthers ahead to stay. Randy
Gyory added an assist on the first
goal and Alfredo Woodman was
credited with an assist on the
second. 'V ' -  ’

with 44 points, including seven
touchdowns, in three games.

Prince, who gained 263 yardsin
only 25 carries two weeks ago
against Drake, which is so far the
nation’s highest single-game rush-
ing total this year, has scampered
for 415 yards in 1976 (6.2 average),
his longest a 68-yarder. After
gaining 92 last week, Prince retired
to the sidelines in the third quarter
with an ankle sprain, but is
expected to play tomorrow.

A transfer from Kansas, Prince
sat out the . entire 1975 season.

»Gibson compares Prince to Mack

Herron, whom he coached while at
Kansas State. Prince has speed,
strength and his low center of
gravity makes him hard totackle.

After Prince, talent on the
Louisville team, at least the kind
capable of standing up against a top
caliber team like Pitt, is" lacking.
The offense will be run by Stu
Stram., quarterback son of New
Orleans Saints coach Hank Stram,
who, as a freshman, has connected
on 14 of 30 passes for 199 yards
since taking over the starting ' job
two weeks ago.

Stram’s prime target is Tony
Smith (ﬁve catches, 18.6 average),
but the senior tight end left in the
second half of the -Wichita State
game with a knee injury and is a
questionable starter.

Two weeks from tomorrow,
Gibson and the Cardinals will travel
south to face Alabama in another
embarrassing game scheduled
solely to upgrade the Louisville grid
program. 

didn’t convert on all of them,‘

however. We made some real nice
setups, but our shooting was bad.

Wework on shooting every day and
we’ll keep right on working on it.”

Gannon tallied late in the first
half to complete the night's
scoring. Much of the second half
was played in a steady rain which

"made footing» and ball control on

the artiﬁcial turf difficult to
maintain.

“I was pleased with our
adjustments and our nonregulars
came through,” - .Bemis said.
“Moyer played a good soccer ‘game
even though he was out of his
position. Steve Harrison played
exceptionally well at halfback also.
I was pleased with everyone. They
all played well. .

“The ball club can be happy with
their effort after our bad trip to
Philadelphia (an 8-0 loss to

.Temple).” Bemis continued.

“Gannon has a ﬁne club. They
have lost only 'to good clubs so far,
but they hurt themselves tonight.”

Gannon’s biggest problem was
ﬁnding a replacement for high
scoring Ayser Susan, who was
ejected midway through the ﬁr-st
half after kicking, then punching
Pitt’s Gyory. Susan has to be
physically restrained from further

violence before leaving the ﬁeld ’

and eventually ‘the, stadium., '

“I've never said we were ready
for the likes of a Pittsburgh or an
Alabama," said Gibson, in his
second year at Louisville. “But we
sure are better than last year. And ‘-
we’re improving every time we
play. We're competitive and we’re
exciting."

But, Vince, so are the powerful
Pitt Panthers who already have
visions of sugar and oranges
dancing in their heads. Tony
Dorsett, with 4,669 yards is closing ,
in on the major college career
rushing record of 5,177 yards,
currently held by Archie Grifﬁn.
Dorsett, who has rambled for 535
yards in 103 carries this season,
needs to average just 73 yards in the
ﬁnal seven regular season games.

_This week, Dorsett should
become all-time major college
leading rusher by passing the mark
of 4,715 yards set by Ed Marinaro at
Cornell.  .

But, as has been seen more and
more each week, the fate of the Pitt
team no longer relies on Dorsett’s
shoulders alone. ’

*-‘I’m pleased with the balance

. our team as shown so far,” head

coach Johnny Majors said. “You
know there are a variety of methods
to win football games, our team has
used nearly all of them—running,
passing, kicking and defense. I
think we’ve shown we have balance,
and that’s most pleasing.”

Majors is hoping quarterback
Matt Cavanaugh and a corp of ﬁne
receivers, which includes Jim
Corbett, Willie Taylor and Gordon
Jones, can keep up their hot pace
which buried Duke last Saturday. In
that game, Cavanaugh completed
14 of 17 passes for 339 yards and a
school recordof ﬁve touchdowns.

The Louisville’ game sizes upto be
a’ battle of two of the nations
outstanding runners——Dorsett and
Prince—-but if Cavanaugh and his
receivers stage another aerial show,
the Panthers‘ could put the game
away much quicker than expected.

Phillies Take East In Pirate Off Year

BY BOB EVANS

A funny thing happened to the
National League East on its way to
the playoffs this year: Neither the
Pirate nor the Mets are represent-
ing it.

The Philadelphia Phillies——the
running, slugging, slick-ﬁelding
Phillies—had learned their lessons
well over the last couple of seasons
and won the East by nine games.
Such a result can hardly be called

emergence as an outstanding
club——a new-found maturity and
poise.

On the concrete side of the
turnabout, Bowa stayed healthy all
season and teamed with Cash to
solidify an already strong defense.
Garry Maddox played superb
defense in center and boosted his
average from .272 to .330. Mike
Schmidt led the majors with 38
homers, and Bob Boone ﬂirted with
.300 all season. Allen was steady, if

baserunners ran wild on him. For
these four, who performed so well
for so many years, was it age?

And what happened to Richie
Hebner for the first four months of
the season? His hat was anemic and

his ﬁelding was hardly any better. _

But he did come on strong through
August and September and could be
a big plus for the Pirates next year.
Rennie Stennett had an up and
down season both at bat and in the

Taveras, the Pirates took to thievery
in an attempt to shake up a lethargic
attack which relied solely on the big
inning. Stennett can run, rookie
Omar Moreno is quick and Al Oliver
and Dave Parker can make a catcher

nervous. Some other strategies new

All in all, it makes for a more

' P Traveled Falck To Go Far
For Promising Pantherettes

.‘.
BY MARIA SCIULLO

Contrary to popular belief,
there are no kangaroos in New
Zealand. There are, however,
many avid long-distance runners
and joggers, and it was in this
environment that Becky Falck first
took up the sport of cross country.

The tall, brunette freshman
ﬁtered the University last month
as the first female ever awarded a
Pitt scholarship for distance run-
ning. Although a native of
Western Pennsylvania, Becky
spent two years in Auckland, New
Zealand.

‘‘I really started out jogging and
then competed in some high school
meets,” she explained. “The
competition wasn't very good,
though. Oh, there was the
o ortunity to run against some
very good athletes, but at the time,
kjust wasn't interested.”

Becky's ﬁrst real track success
.began in 1974, when the Falcks
moved back to Pittsburgh. As a
‘ junior at North Hills High School.
she tied for ﬁfth place in the
Western Pennsylvania Girls’ Ath-

letic League (WPGAL) mile diam‘ '

pionship. A year later, Falck Won
both “the WPGAL Class AAA cross
c untry and two-mile titles, as well
a‘ ﬁnishing second in the state
cross country and WPGAL mile
competition.

“Not only is Becky talented,”
claims coach Freda Goff, “she's
got a super attitude as well. Her
dedication to the sport serves as an
incentive to the other runners on

2 our team. I see great things in
 store for her in the next four
 years,"

 ibetween Randy and the rest of us.

You see, Randy was really into
music. The dude would play his

{L %uitar 24 hours a day if he could and

e perfectly content touring 12
months out of the year._ He was a
real go-getter.

.§When we ﬁrst started out, we

didn't mind being on the road an 7

awful lot. But since then, most of us
have gotten married and got a whole

. bunch a’ kids. Randy was on a little

bit of a,-star trip——he*-thought the

rest of us were holding him back,”

Bravﬁeld said. » .
Brayﬁeld said he was classically

Efisined with the Beatles being his

favorite group. Still he became
noticably excited when I.to1d him
that The Band had recently played a
Piﬁksburgh concert. '

‘f,'l"l" here is plenty of crap ﬂoatin’

said. his attention momentarily

distracted by a young lady prowling ’

by the steps of the Ozarks’ cramped

'. ._ ﬁﬁhley Theatre dressing room.

“KISS, and all them other groups
like that, to me, are just a bunch of
clowns.

recorded at the Caribou Ranch in
Colorado. I asked Brayﬁeld if he
would be interested in buildingssuch
a studio. .

“That would be great, butyou’-d
need a few million bucks to equipit

 .pijope'r'ly. « And nian...I just don't-

Coach Mary Ellen Shea also is
enthusiastic about -Falck. “She's
such a hard-worker, always trying
for her best times," Shea said.
“She will accept coaching so
easily."

What does Falck, with a personal
best of 11:22 and 5:06 in the
two-mile and mile, respectively,
think about herself and running?

“I see room for improvement in
my times, and I think that I will
eventually run faster," she said.

“Things are so different in
college. I ﬁnd the three-mile cross
country course itself a deﬁnite
challenge. Here at Pitt, the
coaches are very concerned and
you can go to them with your
problems. Also, the trainers are
always there and they could ﬁx you
up to run even if you had an
injury."

Besides cooking and swimming,
Becky, who wants to be a dietician,
enjoys travel. ‘‘I enjoy taking
weekend trips to meets,” she said
with a smile, “and I'd really love to
go to the national track champion-
ships at UCLA in the spring.”

Majors Desires Spirit

BY KAREN KADILAK

Last week. back then when no
mention was made yet of “Spirit
Week." head football coach
Johnny‘ Majors emphasized the
need for continued fan support.

“We need that special kind of
enthusiasm within the student
body to continue to win ball games
like we have been doing." Majors
noted last week.

Now, with “Spirit Week” upon
up, Majors is hoping that the
specially designated week he, his
coaching staff and sports infor-
mation director Dean Billick-and
his staff helped organize late last
week will go a long way toward
instilling “that special kind of
enthusiasni,” not only for this
week's'game with Louisville, but
for the four other remaining‘ home
games at Pitt Stadium.

“It's invaluable to have fan
support no matter who or what the
team may be," Majors said, a point
he was to stress again at his weekly

press luncheon Tuesday.

“When we go out on that field
and look up into those stands and
see them filled and the people
cheering," Majors continued. “we
especially look forward to play-
ing. '

While his memories at Pitt have
been fond and, most importantly,
winning ones. his recollections of
years past at Iowa State. where he.
guided the Cyclones to an eventual
Liberty Bowl victory in 1972, also
were gratifying. Part of the reason
for those memories being so fond
was due to the fan support at Iowa
State.

“I remember when we went out
on the ﬁeld for warmups," Majors
said. in reference to his Cyclone
squads. “the stands were always
ﬁlled. People used to be in the
stands by 12 for a 1:30 game.

“I know, being a player once
myself, that when those stands are
ﬁlled and the people are scream-
ing, you really" look forward to
playing," Majors said.

So far,. Majors has been
impressed with the fan support
here at Pitt. In the past ﬁve years,
the Panthers‘ fan support has come
a long. long way. Several seasons
ago, back in those pre-Major days,

I Pitt football tickets were practically

given away the hardest of fans
couldn't bring themselves to make
the trek up Cardiac Hill to see those
threadbare Panther teams.

‘‘I'd rather hear cheers than get
the boo-bird treatment," Majors

commented. “I remember when
there was absolutely no enthusiasm
in the Pitt football
program.

‘TWe as a team aren't supposed
to listen to the fans‘ reaction, but
you can't help but listen when the
fans are on your side. it makes the
job that much easier."

Presently, with the football team
owning a high national ranking,
one of its uppermost swings here at
Pitt. greater fan involvement is
expected. Majors has even come to
face the fact that many fans expect
his charges to produce “super-
human" performances week after

week. uj ‘ --

“I'ni delighted when they think
of us in superhuman terms,"
Majors pointed out. “But I don't

want them to thin that we're going .

to win 50-0 every week. The
student body has to realize that
we're not professionals out there.
The players are just college boys
out to have a good time playing
football.

“If we win. things sure are nicer.
But we aren't frontrunners and we
don't want our fans necessarily to
be frontrunners. All we want is for

everyone involved—the fans, the’
players. and even us coaches—to

have a good time.
