Coeds Debate

Ohio Tuesday

 

[Socialism Is Issue at First

Collegiate Clash.

The ,Pitt women’s debate team
will open its collegiate ~ season
next Tuesday evening, Feb. 16,
when it meets the team from
Ohio Wesleyan University at the

J Washington High School, in Mt.

Lebanon. This debate is being
sponsored by the Woman’s Club
of -.Mt. Leauon. ,

The question which they will
discuss is “Resolved that the 80V-
ernment should own and operate
the basic industries of the United
States.” The University of Pitts-
burghhas the affirmative side of

: this question.

Pitt has been meeting the Ohio
Wesleyan team once or twice a
year for the last six years. The
policy of debate followed by Wes-
leyan most closely conforms with
the policy used here. They have
both agreed to ban decisions and
hold open forum discussion in
which the audience may partici-
pate after the formal debate is
concluded.

In the debate next Tuesday,
blanks will be passed around to
the audience upon which they are
to write which side they favor be-
fore the debate, and again after
the debate, they are to record
whether they favor their former
belief more strongly, are undecid-
ed or have been swayed to the
other side of the question. i

The Ohio Wesleyan team will ar-
rive early Tuesday afternoon and
will be entertained at dinner by
the Woman's Debating Associa-
tion.

Miss Kahn, coach’ of woman's
debating, will preside at the de-
bate. ‘ The team which will uphold
socialism for Pitt is composed of
Marjorie Hanson, Ed. ’34, Louise
Linn, Ed. '32, and Genevieve
Blatt, Col. 33.

Delta Sigma

Phi Resigns,

 

Group Leaves Council;
Claims Fund Shortage

 

Delta Sigma Phi_ national social
fraternity, formally resigned this
week from Interfraternity Council.
A small membership and lack of
funds were the reasons given by
thegroup in tendering its resigna-
tion. By this action, the fraternity
forfeits 'a $50 bond and is not eligi-
ble for re-election to -Council except
under the same requirements, as
that of a new group.

Although resigning from Council,
Milton Bradley, president of Sigma
Delta Phi, stated that the group
would continue on the campus as a
fraternal organization. The house
has nine active members and six
pledges.

Omega chapter of Delta Sigma
Phi was established at Pitt in 1926
and has had many members, promi-
nent in campus activities. The fra-
ternity went through two rather
unsuccessful rushing seasons last
spring and in November, although
the six pledges have been obtained
since that time.

Delta Sigma Phi is the second
Pitt fraternity to give up its house
during the past year. In September
Sigma Pi moved from its house on
Dithridge street to rooms in an Oak-
land apartment.

Phi Beta Delta, national Jewish
fraternity, lvoluntarily abandoned
its chapter here last spring. Theta
Kappa Nu also gave up its charter
in October.

Other business to come before In-
terfraternity Council at its regular
meeting Tuesday evening in the
Sigma Chi house included adoption
of rushing dates for second semes-
ter freshmen. Thq, rushing sched-
ule provides for the’ season to open
on March 16 and to continue to
March 19, inclusive.

A motion to have all rushees out
of fraternity houses by 9 o’clock,
unless they were attending a regu-
larly registered rushing event, was
tabled after considerable discus’-
sion. The motion will again be con-
sidered at the March meeting of
the Council group.

Williams Says Anti - War

Movement is Permanent

 

The permanence of the disarma-
ment movement was stressed by
Dr. Benjamin H. Williams, profes-
sor of political science, in an ad-
dress, “The Disarmament Conven-
tion,” delivered last Thursday
evening to the Business and Pro-
fessional Women’s Club at their
International Relations dinner at

On Washington Committee

Dr. Hart has been historian of
the United States Commission for
the Celebration of the Two ‘Hun-
dredth Anniversary of the Birth of
George Washington. Thus it is
quite appropriate that he should
choose “George Washington the
Founder” for his topic tomorrow
evening. ‘

Dr. Hart was born in lClarkes-
ville, Mercer County, Pa., in 1854
and graduated from Harvard in
1880. After studying in Paris and at
the University of Berlin, he received
his Ph. D., at Freibourg in 1883. Dr.
lHart then returned to America to
teach at Harvard. In 1909 he was

cal Association and in 1912 was
president of the American Political
Science Association. ~

Dr. Hart’s books have been used
as texts in high schools and colleg-
es throughout the country. In .1917
his “America. at'War” and “New
American History’? were published.
Between 1903-18, he edited the
“American Nation” and in 1927-28
he edited “Commonwealth History
of Massachusetts.”

Players Give
Second Play,
“The Swan”

Present Molnar Comedy
Wednesday; Exchange
Begins Monday

 

‘Another of the plays of Ferenc
Mdlnar, whose popularity with lo-
cal theater-goers may go unques-
tioned, will be offered next Wed-
nesday evening in the Y. M. and
W. H. A., auditorium when Pitt
Players present “The Swan,” its
second production of the season.

For the past week, Director Carl
Cass has been rehearsing his cast
of eighteen players in strenuous
afternoon sessions, perfecting the
dialogue and action of the spark-
ling three-act comedy. Technicians
working under Harry Bales. stage
manager, have virtually completed
the elaborate settings for the pro-
duction, which is to have its first
showing Sunday evening at a. pri-
vate performance ,sponsored by
the Irene Kaufmann Settlement.

Betty Quarrie, Col. '34, Florence
Price, Col. ’34, Roy Magram, Col.
’32, Carl Swartz, Col. ’34, and
Clarence Sober Dent. "32, have the
leading roles‘ in the play. “The
Swan” made its initial appearance
on the professional stage with Eva
LeGallienne, Basil Rathbone and
Philip Merivale in the leading
roles. It was this cast which play-
ed to enthusiastic Pittsburgh audi-
ences in the spring ‘of 1924, when
“The Swan” was brought here.

Other successes from the pen of
Molnar, all of which have played
to local audiences on the stage
and, in several instances, in screen
versions, are “The Guardsman,”
“Liliom,” “The Good Fairy,” and
“The Play’s the Thing.”

It's a far cry from the omnious
and philosophically tragic tone» of
“He Who Gets Slapped,” Players’

last production, to the sharp
crackling satire of “The Swan.”
As a social satire, the latter
achieves a brilliance ‘of speech

and action that is unsurpassed by
any of Molnar’s lighter works.
Members ofthe cast had their
work cut out for them in the se-
lection of “The Swan” as the
forthcoming production. '
Exchange Tickets
Under the system of ticket ex-
change for Players’ productions,
any student holding an activities
book may exchange ticket number
24, plus thirty-five cents, for a sea-
son ticket that will be good for
the remaining two productions.
The full price for season tickets
without the activities book, will
be‘ seventy-five cents. Exchange
will take place Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday of next week at
the Players’ booth on_ the first
floor of Alumni Hall.

The World Fellowship committee

Nationalist, to the campus next
Tuesday, Feb. 16, to speak on poli-
tics in India.

The speaker is a graduate of the
Isabelle Thoburn school in India,
and of Columbia University. Her
father is the first native to be
made a bishop in the Methodist
Church of India. Miss Chatombar is
an ardent follower of Gbandi and
has some interesting opinions on
Hindu nationalism.

The meeting will be open to any
one on campus who is interested.
Tea will be served after the discus-
sion. The program has been arrang-
ed by Mary Blackburn, Col. ’33,

and Virginia Graft, Ed. ’33.

No War Unless Drafted-u
Pitt Student Sentiment

By J. JAMES MOORE

Men on the University of Pitts-
burgh campus are opposed to war
with Japan. ,

Opinion by 250 men students re-
vealed that if the continued ag-
gressiveness of the «Japanese mil-
itary machine in China forces the
United States to resort to war with
the Nippon kingdom, the college
man wi11 not be characterized by
frenzied patriotism.

When asked if they favored
armed intervention by the United
States it Japan diregards the prop-
erty and lives of American citizens
in the Orient, 18 said “Yes,” while
232 emphatically replied “No.”

That there has been a decided re-
versal of opinion, since the hysteikg
ica1 ﬂag waving days of the World
War, is plain. Now it seems pa-
triotism has been given a new
meaning, and actual war is looked
upon as a pitiful blunder.

Even more startling facts were
revealed when the men were asked

350 Couples
B all Limit
Must Reserve Tickets for
Interfrat Dance

 

 

There will be only 350 tickets
sold for the Interfraternity Ball,
February 26, because the main
ballroom of the William Penn Ho-
tel permits only that number to
dance comfortably, according to
Theodore W. Biddle, assistant to
the dean of men.

The sale of tickets will differ
from that of the Junior Prom in
that no tickets will be sold out-
right. Reservation tickets costing
one dollar must first b~- purchased
from the committee and then ex-
changed with an additional $4.50
at either the dean of men’s office,
Walter Rome’s office, John Dam-
bach’s office or at the door on
the evening of the dance. No res-
ervation or ball tickets will be
sold at the door.

In bringing Isham Jones to
Pittsburgh to play for the Inter-
fraternity Ball, the committee is
spending more money for music
than has been spent for any
dance of the last two years ac-
cording to an announcement made
by Daniel Butler, chairman of the
committee in charge of the dance.
Isham Jones is known to many
from the Middle West and has
built up an enviable reputation
about Chicago.

This is the first major dance
since the Sophomore Hop in Oc-
tober 1930 to be taken down to
the William Penn Hotel. The
present Senior class——Sophomores
two years ago-——held that dance.
Adjoining rooms to the main ball
room are to be used as lounging
rooms for this evening.

Each fraternity is being made
responsible for the sale of ﬁf-
teen tickets to secure a crowd
which is representative of the fra-
ternities on the campus. Reserva-
tion tickets can be obtained from
any of the members of the com-
mittee. The committee consists of
Chairman Daniel Butler, Anthony
Adonizio, John Stirling, Paul
Best, Howard Henn,. S. Allan Vatz,
Ben Weissman, Harold Cronin,
Paul Friedman, George Harring-

Phillips, Marshall Club
V Speaker Tuesday Night

 

The John Marshall club, pre-
legal honorary fraternity, will meet
Tuesday evening at 8 o’clock in
room 110, Alumni Hall, with H. R.
Phillips, assistant to the district
attorney as speaker. Mr. Phillips
will -speak on the subject “Crimin-

what their reaction would be if the
United States should declare war
on Japan.

104 Will Not Fight.

Only 27 readily expressed a
willingness to volunteer. Those who
would go if drafted numbered 119,
while 104 said that they would not
go to war under any consideration.

Fight in Defense Only.

The men questioned were unan-

Fletcher Dies
In Baltimore

Was Assistant Economics
Professor Since 1927

 

 

Dr. Hugh M. Fletcher, assistant
professor of economics» at the Uni-
versity since 1927, died Wednes-
day in the Johns Hopkins, hospital,
Baltimore, Maryland, where he
had been confined following a re-
cent operation.

The body has been removed to
the home of his parents in Toron-
to, .-Canada. Interment will probab-
ly take place there on Sunday. Dr.
Feltcher had been ill for some
time, and within the past fort-
night had been taken to the Bal-
timore hospital for treatment. Dr.
Fletcher was thirty-seven years of
age.

Dr. Fletcher attended the Uni-
versity of Toronto from 1914 until
1918, and in 1918-19 he attended
the University of British Columbia
where he received his B. A. de-
gree. The following year, Dr. Flet-
cher attended Stanford Universi-
ty, where he received his A. M.
degree. He then went to the Uni-
versity of Kansas, where he serv-
ed in the capacity of assistant pro-
fessor of economics for one year.
Dr, Fletcher next went to Prince-
ton for one year as instructor in
economics.

Studies at Stanford

In 1922, Dr. Fletcher returned to
Stanford University for another
year of graduate study. Then, in
1923, he went, to the University of
Illinois to serve in the capacity of
instructor and at the same time
to continue his graduate study.
After three years of this work, he
received his Ph. D, degree and
was made an associate professor.
Continuing in this capacity for
one year, Dr. Fletcher came to the
University of Pittsburgh in 1927
as assistant professor of econo-

mics, which position he held un-
til his death.

Dr. Fletcher was a member of
Phi Beta Kappa, honorary scho-
last'icI~, frlaternity. The courses
taught by him at the University
were chiefly those in advanced
economic theory.

Dr. Fletcher leaves his wife and
two small children.

The executive committee of W.
S. G. A., voted at a meeting last

i

    

Thursday, Feb. 4, to postpone dis-
cussion on the proposed change of
the name of the organization until
a time when the schedule of so-
cial and,business events is less
crowded. ,

The officers feel that while con-
sideration of the suitability of the
name is important, it is second-
ary to the development of the im-
mediate business of the organiza-
tion. Some of the biggest projects
of W. S. G. A. come during March
and April, and attention could not
be given to the consideration of
this matter without taking the
time and attention of the members
from campus wide events, such
as spring elections, Activities Day
and Senior Week events.

“The value of bringing up the
issue of changing the name,”
says Edith Raschen, president, “is
that it will stimulate thought and
interest among the members of W.
S. G. A. To rush into a change
without seriously considering both
sides would most likely have un-
satisfactory results for the organiz-
ation. Now that the ‘question has

been raised,  may

informally, and when we are ready
to take action on it, the girls can
vote intelligently.”

Another reason why a postpone-
ment of the question is advisable
at Present, is that any change
that mlght be made would require
cumbersome voting procedure to
avoid unconstitutionality. The
question would have to be voted
on. to determine what the general

C ravat Troubles for the Men

 

Members of Art and Fashion Class Fitting Ties To
Reﬂect Personality

 

Men of Pitt—-are you tie con-
scious? Can you select the proper
shade of cravat, the correct mater-
ial, to express your personality?
Do people turn and gaze in envy
when you pass by, realizing that
here is a man who will do great
things, who has that indefinable
something?

No, they don't react that way
to you! But they do to the mem-
bers of the Art and Fashion class.
It all started last Wednesday when
Miss Ely, the instructor, had the

four men students bring all of
their neckties and pool them to-
gether. Then the female members
of the class decided just what ties
best expressed the personality of
each boy. Red was found best to
match the complexions of the
sturdy lads, but blue was not far
behind. And from this time on
there will be at least four Pittites
who know just what color and
fabric to wear, for all of the critics
can't be wrong all of the time.
Tie conscious-——and they like it!

- Most of the zoology classes
are already being held in the

The motion placing Sigma Alpha

The social activities which took place at
the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity house on
Tuesday, November 10, constitute an event
of such nature as to undermine the con-
ﬁdence of the Fraternity Committee in
Sigma Alpha Mu's desire to observe the
fraternity rules in spirit and in letter:
that in the judgment of the Fraternity
Committee these social activities consti-
tuted a violation of the spirit of the
Fraternity Rushing Rules: that the fra-
ternity be placed on probation until at
least February 1. 1933; and that during
this period of probation a different mem-
ber of the fraternity make a report each
week to t-he secretary of the committee:
that the national officers of Sigma Alpha
Mu be given full information regarding
this matter and the penalty imposed, and
that they be advised that further infrac-
tions of fraternity rules on the part of
the fraternity may constitute sufficient
grounds for the University to require that
the charter be withdrawn; that publicity
regarding this infraction and the penalty
imposed be given, and that all fraternities

The‘ Campus I
Scout Says;

What form of collegiate athletic competition requires more guts
than any of the others? .
. This question is one that has often been debated in the past but
has never been settled satisfactorily to all parties concerned. Perhaps,
aftrue measurement of the requirements for greatness in the different
sports can never be realized; but some of the Pitt boys who have com-
-peted in more than one line of sport can tell you which they thought

., required more guts and stamina than the others.

 

Football long ago proved that it demanded more than
speed, strength, and brains. Fe-arlessness from injury was and
is its prime requisite; and that, together with the large stadia
available for the playing of games, largely accounts for the
widespread interest asd respect which’the game commands at
the present time.

Pitt fans can readily recall the incident in the last Notre
Dame-Pitt game when Hart Morris suffered a broke-n hand in
the first quarter and continued in the game until the second
period had almost been completed. And in the 1929 ame be-
tween Pitt and’ Carnegie Tech, Toby Uansa, after being
knocked out in a play near the Tartan goal line, ran around
right end on the following play to score a touchdown.

There are many other incidents of a similar character where men
have refused to quit even though their future physical condition might

, have been endangered by continuing play after they had been injured.

But football of all collegiate sports is not alone in this respect.

I Fans at basket ball games often remark that the lone difference in the

two sports is that the basket ball players don’t wear the protective
equipment to which the football players are accustomed. Bodily con-
tact is common in the cage sport, and a player who avoids collisions
solely for the sake of his own safety is never of as great value to his
team as the man who will risk injury to retrieve a loose ball.

Formerly, these two of the Pitt fall and winter sports
were recognized as those requiring that their p-articipants did
not fear physical punishment; but now with the advent of

'' boxing as a varsity sport at the University, the‘ above two
‘sports are In danger of playing second fiddle to the new sport
in the above. mentioned respect.

When boxing was approved by the athletic council last year
and became a regular feature of the Pitt sports program, few
students considered the sport in a serious light; but with the
progress made during the present season, including the Pan-
thers’ victory over West Virinia, the pioneer in the sport in
the trl-state district, and their fine showing against Syracuse
recognized for a long time as a leader in this respect of col-
legiate competition, boxing is rapidly on its way towards a
major sport.

 

Few fans will recall a more courageous stand than that made by
Jack Schricker in his first ﬁght with Latham of West Virginia at the
stadium on January 29. Schricker, knocked groggy before a half min-
ute had elapsed in the ﬁrst round, held on for the remander of the
round, entered the second round not quite -recovered from the beating
he had received in the first session, pulled up on even terms with his
opponent who had ﬁnished the previous round in great condition, and
then went on to win in the ﬁnal session.

3 And there was the case of Duke Siegel at Syracuse last week.
Siegel was ﬁghting his second collegiate ﬁght and had as his oppo-
nent «Joe Moran, who had piled up a record of 14 knockouts in 15 col-
legiate bouts. One of the Syracuse newspapers had as its main stream-
er,,“Moran’s Knockout Punch Draws Throng To Archbold Gym.”

When the Pitt boy entered the ring, he received the greet-
ing customary to an out-of-town battler. But when Moran en’-I
tered the ring and was introduced to the crowd, it stood as a
body and gave him one of the loudest cheers this writer has

‘ ever heard. ,

Moran's reputation, Siegel’s reenness, and the crowd’s evi-
dent desire to see Moran continue his knockout streak, all tend-
ed to work against the chances of the Pitt man. An ordinary,
fighter would have quit, but not Slegel. He took the play away
from the Syracuse veteran In the ﬁrst round, and Moranwent
back to his corner in‘ a befuddled state of mind, not having been
able to land a solid punch on Siegel.

 

The former’s experience began to tell early in the second round and
he began to pile up a lead. Still Siegel refused to quit. He was still
ﬁghting. back when the referee stepped in and stopped the bout near the
close of the second round. Siegel had not been knocked on his feet
and his touted opponent had not drawn blood from him. Perhaps, some
may not think Siegel’s feat as outstanding as this writer does; but
when one considers the difference in experience between the two, the
crowd’s almost unanimous desire to see the Panther representative
knocked cold, and the sledge hammer blows which Siegel faced almost
continuously for four minutes, the latter deserves all the credit in the

world for his great stand.

You can’t take time out in boxing as you can do in football and

basket ball.
conditions as best as you can.

When you are in distress in the ring, you must meet the
It sure takes something besides mere

cleverness, speed, and a punch to pull through such circumstances.
Several of the football players have dallied around with the sport since
its inauguration and as one of them remarked to another, “I never
knew that I could get so darn tired in two minutes.”

so well during the past week-end;
and -although they made a credi-
table ahowing in all their events,
the Panthers had to be content
with the final percentage of .333
or one victory and two defeats.

The swimming team, pride of
Coach Pat Corr, upheld all his
fond hopes in crushing Wooster,
60-15. The Panther mermen took
every first place and most of the
second places in the meet, com-
pletely outclassing their oppon-
ents. This victory comprised the
total for the week.

The basketball team was not so
fortunate as their swimming
brethren, and dropped one of the
season's roughest games to Notre
Dame at the stadium pavilion last
Saturday night, 26-19. Pitt put up
a better showing than was expect-
ed, and Notre Dame proved that
the press reports concerning their

skill were not unfounded.

A classy boxing aggljegatlon
proved too much for the Pitt mitt-
men, and Syracuse carried off the
scoring honors, 5 1-2 to 1 1-2.

I Schricker, who scored a knockout

in the second round, and Rubbo,
who  a draw, were the only
points.

F rash Cagers Meet
Uniontown Tomorrow

With Hoyas
At Capital

Three Sophomores Hold
Regular Berths On
Washington Five

A busy week-end faces Doc
Carlson's scrappy floormen as
they entrain once again, this time
to Washington, to meet George-
town University tonight and the
Naval Academy tomorrow. Six
days of rest following their gruell-
ing tilt with Notre Dame last Sat-
urday should enable the Golden
Panthers to be in tip-top form
against Georgetown tonight.

Up to this time Georgetown has
been setting a great pace, despite
the fact that its regular lineup
conains three sophomores.’ Jim
Murphy, towering all-state center
from Sharon, and a. former team-
mate of Don McCamant, Panther
guard, covers the pivot position
for the Washington five. King and
Connors will hold down the for-
ward positions against the Pittites,
wihile (fare-lan and Or’N-eil-1 take
care of the guard berths.

All of the Georgetown players,
with the exception of Captain King
scale the six foot mark, Murphy
and Connors being 6 feet 2. The
Pitt lads did not meet the Hoyas
last year, but in 1930 they gave
the visitors a 43-26 trimming on
the stadium floor. A few weeks
ago the Georgetown quintet gave
Duquesne a lot of trouble, which
proves that this year’s aggregation
is above par.

Tomorrow night finds Car1son’s
“ice creamers” facing the Navy
floormen at Annapolis and from
all indications, Pitt should give
the Middies a, good run. -Chitten-
dem, Navy captain, is playing his
first season as a regular and
pairs with Loughlin at forwards.
Kastein. jumps center for the mid-
dies, while Bedell and Frazer are
the guards.

Middies Light

The present Academy team is
very light, probably the smallest
that ever represented that institu-
tion. After starting the season by
winning their ﬁrst ﬁve games, the
Navy lads fell before Pennsylvan-
ia, American University and the
University of Maryland.

Carlson’s passers, deserving of a
better fate in the Irish clash last
Saturday, face the rest of the)
schedule expecting to win a good
majority of their games. Improve-
ment has been noted in each game
and if the players might have
converted some of their free
throws and had a little luck at
the basket during the last half
the Notre Dame game might just
as well have gone the other way.

Battle at Center

Johnny Brown and Ochsenshirt
are still fighting it out for the
regular center berth, while Char-
ley Hughes, robust Hollidaysburg
product, has replaced Don Mc-
Camant at guard. However, Mc-
Camant is a‘ very handy man to
have around and will fit into the
Carlson scheme well before the
conclusion of his career.

Don Smith, Timmy Lawry and
Docky Kowallis are all clicking at
top ,form, Smith especially, has
been a sensation all season, his
disconcerting dribbling opening
the way for Lawry and Kowallis
to get open on many occasions.

Profs To Meet Creeks;
Gabfest Precedes Bowling

It’s he-re again. The faculty
bowling team has issued its per-
ennial challenge to the interfra-
ternity bowling champions, claim-
ing that the Pi Lambda Phi squad
Who are holders of the interfrat
title are not the real University
champions, but just a group of
incipient and inflated pinsters,
who know how to count what they
score only because they never
score more‘ than what maybe
counted on ten fingers.

The faculty are in great form.
They won't admit this, stating
that the exigencies of a severe
teaching career prevent their in-
dulgence in anything so immateri-
al and pointless as bowling. But‘
take it from this reporter (you’ll
probably leave it) the profs have
been training behind barn doors

and alley fences for months in
preparation for the coming titan-
ic contest.
Students Confident

-The student team is confident
of a decisive victory. The rum-
blings and mutterings which have

-Carl F. Distelhorst, accounting
instructor, is captain of the facul-
ty team. Walter J. Rome, gradu-
ate manager of student activities;
John G. Quick, University regis-
trar; Theodore W. Biddle, assist-
ant dean of men, and Jules La-
barthe, industrial fellow of the
Mellon Institute, are the other
members of the team.

The profs form a sweet combi-
nation. Ted Biddle, according to
the best reports, can average a
cool 1401 a game, and Jules La-
barthe is just about as good. For
the others, its a secret. They're
going to spring their ability as a
surprise upon the Pi Lambs the
night of the match.

Strand Makes Mazuma

The match is scheduled for
next Tuesday night, if the Greek
champions don’t take a run-out-
powder on the faculty. The games
will take place at the Strand al-
leys, which is strange to the Pi
Lambs. And what a wicked gleam
Disty’s eyes held as he told me
where the match was to be held.

The faculty also wants to ex-
tend a challenge to any other
group on the campus, excluding
girls, The girls have been dyna-

The faculty come right back
with, “If we can’t beat you bowl-

Coach Not To
Suggest Grid
Rule Changes

Sutherland Represents
Coaches Before Rules
Committee

When the Football Rules Com-
mittee opens its annual pow-wow
today at Hanover, N. H., it will
do so without any recommenda-
tions for rule changes from Jock
Sutherland, Pitt grid coach. He
contends that there is nothing‘ es-
sentially wrong with the game as
it is played today.

Only Minor Changes

“So far as I can make out,‘ there
will be no changes made in the
game of football next year other
than very minor ones,” he said.

“To begin with,” he continued,
“the rules committee is a sane
body and will not make any
changes which would be detrimen-
tal to the game. Its primary ob-
ject is to protect the player; ev-
erything else is secondary. I have
been associated with the commit-
tee in some sort of capacity for
the past few years and I doubt

if I’ll recommend any changes
whatsoever.
Roug-hing Passers
“One rule which might be ‘im-

proved, however, is the one about
roughing a passer, And there are
two sides to that debate. If he is
given too. much protection, he can
turn the game into a fox hunt,
with himself as the fox. Take a
passer of the Friedman or Cagle
type, for instance! He. could fade
away back and the in-charging
linemen would not be allowed to
throw him because that would
carry a roughing penalty. On the
other hand, a passer who throws
from a. standing position could be
more fully protected. Yes, I think
that is one rule which might be
more specific.”

Sutherland is not a member of
the Rules Committee; he isa
coaches’ delegate who makes rec-
ommendations to the committee.
At present he is chairman of the
membership committee of the
coaches’ board.

Eliminates“ Taping

Last year he had much to do
with the ruling which eliminated
the taping of the players’ hands.
According to Sutherland, the tape
did the gridder no earthly good
and it was disgusting to him to
see two husky teams come out on
the field with‘ their hands looking
as if a few mosquitoes had roosted
there the night before. Besides, it
gave the impression that this was
done so that the players could
hit each other harder. Now, only
a player who has an injured hand
is allowed to have it taped. Last
season, Hart Morris, a guard,
played with a bandaged hand, but
he had had a few small bones
broken. Before he could play, the
officials had to be satisfied that
there really was a reason, for the
tape.

When asked what he thought of
the prospects of next year’s team
he replied in true Sutherland
fashion, “Well, I’ll have to wait
to see what they can do when
spring training begins next month.
I hope to get a fair idea of what
to expect of my line at that time,”

BQXERS SEEK SECOND CONFERENCE VICTORY’

Panthersmet Owls

In Second Home Duel;   
Orsini Shifts Lineup

 

. Although defeated by the Syracuse mittmen last Saturday
night, the Panther boxers are in good shape to tackle the clever
Temple University Owls tomorrow night at the stadium pa-
vilion. Pitt will try for its second victory in the Eastern Inter»-

collegiate Boxing Conference tomorrow night, and, if victorious, 

will tighten the hold they now

their victory over West Virginia.%

have on ﬁrst place by reason of

This will make Temple’s ﬁrst con-
ference bout.

Practically the same lineup that
fought ‘West Virginia and Syra-
cuse will carry the Panther hopes
for victory, with the probable ex-
ception of McCarroll in the 115
pound dlivis-ion, land Schimpf in
the 135 pound class.

Veterans on Temple Team

Temple, with three veterans on
the squad, one a semi-finalist in
his class in the National A. A. U.,
tourney last year, holds a slight
edge on the Pitt boxers, but the
Panthers can be expected to put
up a stiff opposition in all divi-
sions.

Bill McCarroll, a sophomore in
the Pharmacy School, will likely
fight D'Allesandro in the opening
bout, at 115 pounds. D’A1lesandro
is putting in his second year on
the Temple squad, and was in the
semi-finals of the national A, A,
U., 118 Dound title last year. Mc-
Carroll is a. newcomer to the Pitt
squad but has had previous. ama-
teur experience. The bout tomor-
row night will mark his initial
collegiate appearance. However,
both boys are aggressive, and
should provide a lively three
rounds.

Conti Favored

Eshleman, of Temple, will meet
Conti in the 125 pound bout, ac-
cording to the present outlook.
Eshleman is boxing for the first
year and Conti’s past experience
gives him a slight edge. Conti will
enter the ring weighing at least
five pounds less than Eshleman,
Eshleman is speedy -and shifty
but lacks ‘a punch.

Another nelwcomler, Schimpf,
will be ‘Coach Orsini’s choice for
the 135 pound class, and Coach
Beloff, of Temple, will place his
hopes on Emanuel Fischhoff, a
veteran of two seasons. Fischhcff
is a fair boxer and a notoriously
hard hitter. and holds a big edge
for the fight.

Mario Rubbo, who earned a
draw at Syracuse, will go into the
rmg tomorrow night a slight fav-
orite to whip Valentine Manning

in the 145 pound class. Both boys

are putting in their first year on
their respective squads, but from
past performances, Rubbo should
take the bout.

The real piece de’ resistance for
the hungry fight crowd will be
in the 155 pound class, when
Jack Schricker meets Irving
Kutcher, captain of the Temple
team for the second successive
season. Schricker, with a record
of four knockouts and a decision
to. his credit in his last five fights
will be up against one of the best
£55 pounders in collegiate competi-

on.

In his four years as a member
of the Temple boxing team, Captain
Kut-cher has lost but three times in
seventeen starts, all of his loss-
93 being‘ by decisions. If Schrick-
er_ can come through this bout
with another victory to his string
he will have a high collegiat rank-
mg.

Kappa Sigma
Wins Opener

Phi Delts V
Feature Cage Game

With Bill Keller, varsity track
star, coming through with four ﬁeld
goals in the second half, Kappa Sig-
ma, one of the favorites to cop this
year’s interfraternity basketball
tournament, managed to nose ‘out
Phi Delta Theta, one of its closest
competitors, in its opening game,
19-18.

Football men played outstanding

Ben Delello and Bib Timmons dom-
inated the ﬂoor play of the victors
and constantly fed Keller after
feinting his guard out of position,
while Bob Hoel and Ed. Thomp-
son, freshman gridmen, stood out,
in the play of the Phi Delts.

The game will go far in deter-
gmining the ultimate winner of Sec-
tion I in which these two teams
are enrolled. Both te-ams were con-
sidered the class of their league
with the Delts having an outside
chance of breaking through.

The Delts won their

163’ Hartwig was high scorer for
the winners while George Golanty
featured in a similar role for the
losers. The other games found
Lambda Chi Alpha winning over
Theta Delta Psi, 1-0-9, and Omega,
Delta trouncing Theta Chi, 15-13.
Not one point was scored in the

Lambda Chi Alpha game.

The schedule for Section 2 under-
went change this week with the an-
nouncement that Kappa Nu, win.
ners of the championship last ye-ar,
had withdrawn. This fact leaves
seven teams in Section 2, one less
than the number in the
group. Reichenbach and ‘Yoffe,

.,L

Pitt Puck To Portray
. Campus Traditions
In Water Fete

, The “Splash Skit,” sponsored by
the ‘Women’s Athletic Association

I will be presented Tuesday evening
February 16, at 8 o'clock, in the
Trees Gym. Mrs. Frances R. Trac-
ey, instructor in physical educa-
tion, is directing the skit.

The story will portray the prob-
lem of King of Pittwood and his
beautiful daughter, Panthetta. The
worried king asks the assistance

» of his court entertainers in helping

'“ - him make Panthetta forget her
books and enter the social life of
the court.

Panthetta dreams of Pitt Puck,
who dances in with -his water
sprites. His first marvel is a dance

, of the bookworms in funny cos-

 _, tumes which makes Panthetta re-
.alize how the people must picture
her. _He continues his program
with a novel crew race, dancing

co umes and fish scales...

Pitt Puck’s entertainment then
, begins to represent and explain to
4.  i the girl many of the Pitt tradi-
 tions transferred to water. A
'5, Sport Float, representing the Pa-
‘ ‘ rade of the Pantherettas; will be
portrayed with the assistance of
‘two girls from each fraternity, and
, , a. canoe. This will be followed by
‘  ,.s miniature Steeple Chase com-
posed of six teams of two girls
each." A mentor group sketch un-
, der the direction of Hilda Rubin,
 ‘ dressed in frilled collars and huge
-. sashes will sing an original fresh-
 man‘ song. Eighteen girls will do a
 2 quake swim representing victori-
'~ . ous enthusiasm.

Watching this program Panthet-
ta grows enthusiastic and discard-
ing her book, she begs to be al-
lowed to dance herself. After her
dance, Pitt Puck plays his last
‘tfick and portrays one of the
most impressive of Pitt Women’s
ceremonies, the Lantern Cere-
mony. The swimmers, dressed in
Pitt colors and carrying lighted
candles and Pitt-Tech balloons,
march around and form a letter
“P". As a grand finale, a group
of fancy divers dive into the head
of the letter.

W. Va. Meet

Crack Relay Team To
Carry Pitt Colors In
Annual Events

Thirty-eight members of the
varsity and freshman track teams
will board a bus early tomorrow
morning for Morgantown, West
Virginia, where they will take
part in the fourth annual West
Virginia University indoor track
meet, being staged there.

The Pitt aggregation, the strong-
est in years, looms as being ca-
pable of winniﬂ the meet and is
expected to make what may be
called an eminently satisfactory
showing. Georgetown, winner of
the meet last year, will be back in
full force and with West Virgin-
ia, the hosts, and Pitt, are expect-
ed to fight it out for team honors.

Keller Outstanding;

There is'an abundance of mater-
ial on the Panther squad this year.
Possibly the outstanding star is
Bill Keller, a sophomore who made
a sensational record us a fresh-
man last season and who should
fill Pete Bowen's shoes most thor-
oughly. Keller will compete in the
440 and 880 yard races dufing
the season and is a member of
the two crack Pitt relay teams
which will run tomorrow.

Captain Leonard Monheim, spee-
dy little sprint star, will take
part in the dashes, running tomor-
row in the 70 yard dash and in
the relays. ~

Tom Mllligan, former Peabody
high school ace will also runin
the dashes. Milligan compiled a
brilliant record as a freshman last
year and should be good for a
number of first place - _Milligan
will run in the 70 yar” '2 dash to-
morrow and also in the relay.

Still More sprinters

Still a third sprint star is Woody
Harris, who dragged down a col-
lection of medals last season and
who is expecting to augment that
supply this season.. Miller and
Brown are allso entered in the
sprints tomorrow.

There will be two relay races
tomorrow, one in which each man
tray els 176 yards and one in which
the'runner travels 352 yards. The
Pitt relay teams for both races
will be composed of Milligan, Kel-
ler, Monheim and Harris.

Rob Roy, Pitt runner who was
on the team several years ago, but
who dropped out of school, has re-
turned and is eligible. He will run
in the distance races, taking part
tomorrow in the half mile and the_
one mile run. Others who are en-
tered with Roy in these races to-
morrow are Watkins, Tapp, Gaines
Clise, Lawrence, Mazzei and
Thiele..
’ Lewis in Hurdles

There will be a 70 yard high and
a 70 yard low hurdles race tomor-
row. Marshall Lewis will be the
Pitt best bet to take these events
tomorrow, while Thiessen, Guay
and Robinson will do their best
torbeat him and the other entrants
Howdie O»’dell, football player,

Mermen Face
Delaware U.

Schmeiler Wins A. M. A.
Breast-stroke Title

 

Pitt swimmers will meet the
University of Delaware tankers in
their first meet, with a member of
the Eastern ‘Intercollegiate Swim-
ming Association, a league which
Pitt recently joined. The meet
takes place tonight at the Key-
stone Athletic Club pool.

" Anticipates Close Duel

The Delaware school is said to
have an experienced team;
have been engaging in competi-
tion with many fast Eastern
squads. Coach. Corr is anticipating
a closer meet than that with
Wooster last week.

At the same time the varsity
is meeting Delaware, the freshmen
take on the Clairton High School
team, always a strong W. P. I. A.
L. contender. The Pitt team has
been strengthened somewhat by
the acquisition of two backstrok-
ers, Jones and Swazik, though it
has lost a good 220 man since
Fred Warren was declared ineli-
gible.

Panthers Feature

Panther swimmers featured the
Allegheny Mountain Association
meet held at the Keystone Athlet-
ic Club Wednesday, February 10.
Two senior titles were at stake
in the meet, the 100 yard free-
style, and the 220! yard breast-
stroke. Joe Schmeiler, Pitt sopho-
more, was the winner of the
breaststroke event in 3 minutes 9
seconds flat. Joe was pushed all
the way by Kish of Carnegie Li-
brary Club whom Joe has defeat-
ed in two dual meets this year.

Though Pitt qualified four men
for the finals of the freestyle
event, the best they could get in
the finals was a second place,
Herman Adlersberg coming in
just behind Russel Lindberg of
the Home-stead'Li'brary Club. Lind-
berg’s time for the 100 was 57.4.
Hanna, Davies and Denny were
the other Pitt men to qualify for
the final.

Miss Ely to Interview
Stylists in New York

Miss Grace Ely, art and fashion
consultant of the Research Bu-
reau of Retail Training, is leaving
today for New York City. While
there she will interview the style
authorities of "Harper’s Bazaar,”

and McConnell, veteran, will com-
pete in the pole vault. O’del1 has
done 12 feet in practice. In the
broad jump Sebastian, Stirling,
Thiessen and Miller will take
part while. in the running high‘
jump Kirkpatrick, Stirling and
Lewis will compete. '
Pitt has several excellent Weight‘
prospects this year. John Valenti,
sophomore football tackle who
scales away over 200 pounds is
one of the Panther’s best bets
here; Jiohnny Luch, fullback on
the grid team and Jim MacMur-
do, all-American tackle and one of
the best high school stars also
will compete. Harder is another.
Frosh Sprinters

There are several comers on the
freshman squad also. Especially
do we find excellent sprinters
with Sol Menaker of Jefferson
High School, Brooklyn, being out-
standing. Ed Eberts, Peabody
High School flash; 1'“ Jacobson,
Fleming and Schlosberg are all
likely looking men. These are all
entered in the 70 yard dash tomor-
row.

In" the 440 yard dash tomorrow,
Menaker, Paul MacMurdo, O'Don-
ald, Oveson, Ginn and Kiger are
all entered.'The frosh have also
entered a team in the sprint. re-
lay event. .

Intersorority Basketball
May Cause Friction

 

 

The Intersorority basketball
Tournament scheduled to begin
next week has been definitely
called off by the Women’s Athletic
Association. Cooperating with the
Panhellenic Association of the
University, they will attempt to
do away with any unnecessary

competition which might arise
among sorority members in the
other organizations and which
may caused strained associations.

Both organizations are of the
opinion that it is advisable to
avoid any contest which may give
rise to bitter relations. The pur-
pose of Panhellenic is to create
a friendly and cooperative attitude
between sorority members and the
organizations, and any additional
urge for competition may defeat
this purpose.

Mildred Levenson, Col. ’32, pres-
ident of Panhellenic, explains

they .

sorority girls may meet

illustrate color, -2

that: “Panhellenic d'isapproves of
the tournament only because of
the strained feeling it may cause
among the non-sorority women. W.
A. A., is composed of both classes
of girls and an attempt will be
made to promote athletic contests
in-which both the sorority and non-
on an
equal footing."

Johnson Advises Mental .
Tests for Immigrants

A plea for making use of the
median in mental tests as the
main basis of immigration featur-
ed an article on Population Con-
trol of Migration, by Professor
Roswell H. Johnson, head of the
department of oil and gas produc-
tion, and noted authority on eu-
genics in the February issue of
the Birth Control Review.

This median of mental ability,
Professor Johnson stated, has
been fairly well established by
results of several mental tests on
citizens of this country. By apply-
ing it as the-basis for admission
of immigrants to the United States
the standard of such incoming im-
migrants can be raised consider-
ably,

Fund Opens

Memorial Loan Beneﬁts
Prospective Teachers

 

 

Dr. Walter B. Jones, professor.
of higher education, announced to-
day the founding of the Grover H.
Alderman Memoriai Loan Fund.
The fund will be used to make
semi-annual awards, probably in
the shape of scholarships to stud-
ents planning to be teachers, and
will be on ‘a basis of high scholar-
ship, promise as a teacher, and

       

character. The loans will be repa.y- I .

able at no definite time, but rath-
er whenever the recipient is able.
The committee in charge at
making the award will be select-
ed from the members of'Phi’Deltt.
Kappa, Kappa Phi Kappa, Phi
Lambda Theta, the faculty of the
school of education and the alum-
ni of the school of education. The
secretary of the University will
be the sixth member of the com-
mittee. Each of the foregoing has
contributed to the award fund.
At present the fund is small
only sufficient to make one awa
but the executive committee ' for
the fund has worked out a plan
for the administration of the fund
which includes a provision for 
ditional subscriptions at later

times. The committee is planning:

to make an award this year.

In making the announcement.
Dr. Jones stated, “The purpose of
the fund is to stimulate interest
in good teaching as a memorial to
Dean Alderman, who himself, was
a master teacher.”

- -Dangerous Year

 

"R. E, L. THORNDYKE, a

. psychologist who has
specialized on the study of
youth, is of the opinion that the
Senior year in college is 3. dan-
gerous one. Dr..'1,‘_horndyke has
been conducting‘ intelligence
tests, studying scholastic rec-
ords, and- investigating the!
habits "of hundreds of college
men and women, and he is
surprised to discover that a
rather curious transition
comes over the average col-
lege student between his Jun-
ior and Senior years.

Dr. Thorndyke points to the
fact that out of more than 1000
students entering the Univer-
sity of Chicago Law School in
recent years, those who have
come in after three years of
college work have attained on
the average appreciably high-
er grades and have stayed to
graduate in far larger propor-
tion than entrants with four
years of college behind them.

Can it be possible that there
is something pernicious in it-
self in too long a lingering in
the academic air? Do Seniors
have a. tendency to become in-
dolent and careless about their
work? The probability is
there. During three years al-
ready spent in school, they

 have become familiar with the
- ,.methods of the faculty;

they
have learned how to avoid
courses which entail obnox-
ious ‘duties; they realize that
they have obtained as much
glory from participation in ex-
tra.-curricular activities as they
might expect. Because of the
position in which they find
themselves, many Seniors de-
termine that their last semes-
ters in school shall provide
less work and ‘more fun. There
is a. let-down in both mental
and physical effort.

Yet, according to the study
of Dr. Thorndyke, the price
paid for this indifferent atti-
tude during the Senior year is
a lethargy that persists in
post-graduate work or in the
effort to obtain some sort pf
employment. Perhaps the Sen-
ior year needs to be made
more stimulating, more com-
petitive.

 

Appeal For Support

HE OWL, 1ike most campus
activities, is feeling the
pinch of student economy.
Sales of the annual are away
below normal and the sponsors
of the book are concerned
about it. One even hears dole-
ful assertions going about to
the effect that there will be
no annual next year unless
student support within the
succeeding weeks takes a.
' -bound upward.

Actual sales ﬁgures for the
volume, which will be publish-
ed in May, reveal that less
than half of the Senior class
has subscribed for the book.
The schools of Dentistry and
Pharmacy must be excepted

however, for senior support in
these divisions of the Uni-
versity has been almost
unanimous. Lo w e r c lassmen
never have supported the pub-
lication to any great extent, so
that in this year when Seniors,
themselves, are refusing to
show interest. the situation
takes on nothing but a dire as-
pect.

Appeals to class loyalty,
school spirit, or sentiment we
believe to be rather futile. The
present Senior class will not
have to worry. Those who
have shown sufficient interest
in the book will receive it and
keep it as a pleasant memory
of their many school associa-
tions. It is the Freshmen,
Sophomores, and Juniors who
should be concerned about the
situation. If the forthcoming
volume is a failure, ﬁnancially,
there will probably be,no book
next year. This is an eventu-
ality that is to be guarded
against. The solution would
seem to be for the underclass-
men to support the present
volume at the specially reduced
prices which are now being of-
fered. In this way they can
keep the Owl on the campus.

 

Revised Decision

HOULD AN UMPIRE re-
verse his decision, he
would ﬁnd himself in an inex-
tricable maze of difficulties.
Should a. court change its de-
cision, it should be done in the

ed.

During the past week, the
Fraternity Committee of the
University altered 3. previous
regulation imposed on a social
fraternity for alleged violation
of the rushing rules. This
change was ordered after new
evidence had been introduced
and a technical violation dis-
proved. The Fraternity Com-
mitte is not to be censured
for its reversal of attitude, but
it rather to be commended
for keeping the case open and
giving an impartial hearing to
those most directly affected.
The Committee sits as a court
to interpret t-he regulations un-
der which fraternities are su-
pervised. It is not seeking to
obtain any of the arbitrariness
of a. referee and the distinction
should be born in mind

Although few will question
the wisdom of the Committee
in Changing its decision, the
case illustrates the need for a.
clariﬁcation of what consti-
tutes a rushing event. Rumors
of fraternities violating the
rules have been rather general,
but it would seem that it was
not so much the conscious in-
tent Of the glﬁooups to digre-
gard the regulations as it was
a rather general ignorance of
their provisions_ _

_The Fraternity «Committee
Will probably deﬁne what it
considers a. rushing event very
deﬁnltely before the next open
season on Freshmen roll
around.

We have been learning more and
more certainly within the past
few years to consider our civili-
zation at a. distance, to pose it
before us as we pose Egyptian

and Greek culture, to examine and
analyze it, seeking. in it some
single principle that will unify the
whole. And the one principle which
we hear stressed always is the
dynamic one. “This,” they tell us.
“is a dynamic age. There is a
sense of going in it, a perpetual
change, a constant moving.” And
we add, looking back at the more
static cultures, “We lack rest.”
To rest in anything; but in the
arts restlessness embodied most
completely. That which is restful
is conservative, even reactionary.
That which has any sense of sus-
pended motion in it belongs to the
conservative school. There is al-
ways a. feeling of going which
makes any modern production
scarcely a. thing with which one
would desire to live. Take, for
example, the pictures in'the Inter-
national.

which you, coming home wet
and tired and jaded from a bad
afternoon, could contemplate
even the most gracious odal-

seeking pictures which would

and Pieter de Hooch. In them
it is possible to find the jading
sense of going entirely elimi-
nated; from their grave surfac-
es it is possible to acquire

rest.

The same principle is clear in
our literature. We have no poets
to whom we may come for calm.
Those who do not distract us with
shifting and irregular forms-—
Leonie Adams, Eleanore Wylie,
Rupert Brooks—a.re themselves
pure symbols of the dynamic
sense. But poets have always been
endowed with, some portion of
restlessness. Perhaps the novelists
are better grounds for proof.
Drieser presents, Maugham analyz-
es, Joyce embodies a various and
kaleidoscopic world. But for a stat-
ic view, in which all things take
the proper proportions and pers-
pective is defined, we must turn
back to Jane Austin and her con-
temporaries and forbears.

culture offers us, it is impossi-

build any house at all. If we
go journeying with the rest of
the never-pausing age, our
novelists will point out the
branching roads, our painters
will provide us with maps and

marching songs, our scientists
will supply us with meat and

have died long before we set
out on this soul's migration

Failure of System

“Capitalism has failed!”

,With P this emphatic declaration,
Paul "Porter, field representative
of the League of Industrial Democ-
racy, began his Inquiry Club ad-
dress in ‘Alumni Hall Wednesday.

The speaker discussed some of
the ways in which he believed
our present ecoiromic
had fallen short, and cited the dis-
crepancy between the suffering in
this country and the amount of
needed food and clothing which

could be produced, against what. .

now is produced and wasted. He
told of his travels in the trouble
fields of the south, of the pitiful

west because it could not be
sold, of the wretchedness of our
coal miners here in Pennsylvania.
Mr. Porter advocated a socialis-
tic form of government, one in
which the principal feature would
be governmental control of public
utilities and natural resources. To
refute the objections raised he
showed the schools, the Panama
Canal, and the Postal Savings
Banks as examples of successful
governmental‘ ‘ control.
