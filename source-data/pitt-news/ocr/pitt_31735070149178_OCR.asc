Technology is fast—paced and con-
stantly improving. But until last
month, you wouldn’t have known it ,
from checking Pitt’s website.

Over winter break, the Univer-
sity relaunched its website with a
new design meant to keep up with
changing times. _

John Cooper, director of web
communications, explained that
Pitt’s old website and home page
was constructed for computers
designed at the start of the mil-
lenium. Speciﬁcally, Cooper said,
the old homepage was developed
for smaller screens.

But during the subsequent de-
cade, the web greatly evolved, leav-
ing the old website obsolete. '

“By making the site ﬁt the cur-
rent standard of 960 pixels wide,
we can get more menu items while
also maintaining a site that’s not
overwhelming for people,” he said.

Around August 2011, multiple
parties collaborated in an effort
to update pitt.edu. Cooper said
developers and producers in Pitt’s
marketing communications de-
partment worked with members
of the Ofﬁce of the Provost and
the web division of the'marketing
communications office to bring the
home page project to-completion.

“Things ramped up in terms
of design content production last
spring, in April,” he said.

Although Cooper was unable to
provide a dollar amount for the cost
of the website reconstruction, he
did say that any costs would have

The Book Center renovates, improves service to students

Dustin Gabler
Senior Stcyff Writer

This semester should mark the last
that students hoping to purchase
books from the University Book
Center will need to visit the Pitt
mainstay’s temporary location.
Renovations to the University
Book Center will be complete by
the fall 2013 semester, according to
bookstore manager Debra Fyock.
She promises that the spring se-
mester will run much smoother
than the Fall semester did now
that the staff has experienced the

beginning of semester rush at the
temporary location. In the fall, The
Book Center was plagued by long
lines that stretched out the door.

“We have an even better idea
of what the challenges are that
face us in the spring,” Fyock said
after the fall-semester rush. “We
are already addressing them, I can
assure you. Our objective is always
to provide our University commu-
nity with the necessary tools to
enhance their college experience.
Our students can expect that from
us in the spring.” .

In two days this past summer,

Fyock and her staff moved the en-
tire bookstore from its Fifth Av-
enue location to the temporary one
on Forbes Avenue. Textbooks were
handled ﬁrst to serve students.
The add/drop period was also
extended for one week to better
accommodate them.

Despite all of this work, several
students were still unable to get

the textbooks that they needed for p

the fall semester at the bookstore,
something that the bookstore’s
staff regrets.

“Not all books were here for
the start of school,” Fyock said.

“That is a source of frustration for
everyone.”

On July 13, the University of
Pittsburgh Board of Trustees ap-
proved the $9.43 million renova-
tion to the University bookstore.
Due to the renovation, the Fifth
Avenue location needed to be shut
down for construction, and Pitt-
searched for a temporary location.

“When a former bookstore on
Forbes Avenue became available,
we decided that it could provide

gone toward paying for the time of those who
worked on the project.

Apart from these departments, focus
groups made up of students, faculty and staff
took part in the website design process. Pro-
spective students and parents also provided
insight through a survey.

While working on improving pitt.edu,
prospective students were considered the
primary audience, as the majority of the site’s
traffic comes from outside the University.

Cooper said the main purpose of the re-
design project was to keep up with technol-
ogy and make the website user-friendly. He
explained that a person’s online experience
will directly affect their feelings about the
University and its overall brand.

“Hopefully, people will view this page
and feel that Pitt’s a friendly and modern
University, that it communicates with its
constituents effectively and that they come
away with a good feeling and what they were
looking for,” he said.

Before implementing any changes, Coo-
per and his team looked at numerous other
university and college home pages and com-
mercial sites.

Carnegie Mellon’s home page, for exam-
ple, offers links to frequently visited por-
tions of the website and a section to view
recent news and events — two elements
Pitt chose to incorporate into its new home

The new Pitt home page features a modernistic layout. ' s *

Cooper said they primarily researched the
websites of other universities that are a part
of the Association of American Universities,
as they are most similar to Pitt.

“We took a look to- benchmark against
them  to see what types of links and'navi-
gation items they had,” he said. C‘

By comparing and evaluating other,iini-
versity home pages, Cooper said his team

      
     
  

     
      

developed a sense of what the expectations
would be for the site’s visitors.

Some students who recently visited the
updated site expressed satisfaction with the
changes. -

Sophomore Shane Kelleher said he expe-
rienced difﬁculty with navigating the old site.

“The new one seems more user-friendly,”
he said. .

Sophomore Luke-Burke agreed that the
new website has improved from its former
format.

“It’s a more modernistic approach to the

' old website. It brings Pitt up to par with the -

advancement of technology itsel ,” he said.

Pitt.edu is now also better optimized for
tablets and mobile devices. Cooper saidthe
menu will automatically adapt to each re-
spective device. For example, on a mobile
phone screen, it will convert to a vertical
design. p .

The new home page also incorporates a
better system for University webmasters to
maintain the information online.

“Since its easier to maintain, it’ll be kept

. up to date more frequently,” Cooper said.

Cooper said thewebsite is awork in prog-
ress and that the web communication depart-
ment -is looking forward to further reﬁning
the website in the coming months‘: ‘and years.

“We’re going to beiina bettér positionto
keep it moving forward and not let it become

store, knowing that there were going to be
challenges to address in preparation for the
fall rush,” Fyock said.

The pricey renovation includes improve-
ments to the store, which hadn’t been re-
modeled since it opened in January 1960.
At the time, the University Book Center was
lauded as the largest college bookstore in
the country. The additions include more
signs, a new entrance, a coffee shop, im-
proved customer ﬂow, study areas and a
service area for digital technology.

Two of the most anticipated improve-
ments are the technology center and the
coffee shop. They will create spaces for
students and the general public instead
of just long lines and a get-in-and-get—out
mentality.

The coffee shop will be similar to the
shops and carts found around campus. It
will serve Starbucks coffee along with snacks
and drinks and will accept dining dollars.
This proposed addition was well received
in surveys, allowing students to share input

regarding the renovation.

“We knew that we wanted to include a
coffee shop because coffee and books are
such a perfect match,” Fyock said. “Both
the student and faculty surveys supported
this idea.”

The decision to renovate instead of
construct a new bookstore was a simple
one. Real estate is hard to ﬁnd and pricey
in Oakland. The central location of the cur-
rent store is of huge value to Pitt.

“It was determined that The Pitt Book
Center should be centrally located,” Fyock
said. “We also wanted it to be a vital part
of Oakland’s business and retail district.
All in all, there was no existing structure
in Oakland that would easily address these
considerations to the degree that the cur-
rent structure does. Thus, the decision to
renovate rather than relocate.”

With the addition of more promotional
signs and a third entrance in the Schenley
Quad by the Fifth Avenue vehicle entrance,
Pitt hopes to increase the number of cus-
tomers coming to the bookstore.

“Often people have the impression that
The Book Center carries materials that are

only accessible to the University commu-

nity,” Fyock said. “We want to continue to
be a valuable resource for the community
at large, especially in light of the fact that
there simply are not many bookstores re-
maining in the Pittsburgh area. To ensure
public awareness, we increased visibility
with planned changes to our main entrance,
storefront and signage.” ‘ 

The renovation will also allow. certain
areas of the store to remain open.‘a%fter

store hours, allowing for the promotion of A

guest speakers, graduation and homecom-
ing events, book signings and study spots,
Fyock said.

Although the University hopes the im-
provements appeal to and attract prospec-
tive students, current students had mixed
feelings about the temporary store. Some
have given the bookstore the beneﬁt of the
doubt and are chalking up all of the incon-
veniences as a sacriﬁce for a better store.

“This bookstore is only temporary. It’s
not like this is going to be an ongoing prob-
lem. I thought everything was run pretty
smoothly besides the whole line problem,”
junior wellness major Kyle Meeder said, re-
ferring to the long lines at the store during
the fall semester.

As a result of the move, many students
are discovering that‘Campus Bookstore, a
privately owned used bookstore on Fifth
Avenue, has good deals with a similar store
space to that of the temporary University
bookstore. .

“I’ve recently discovered that buying
international books and books frornythe
used bookstore on-Fifth Avenue [Campus
Bookstore] is much; cheaper than the Uni-
versity bookstore,” junior biological science '
major Fawn Armagost said. “-They won’t
be having my service anymore unless it is
absolutely necessary.”

Other students aren’t complaining about
the store or the lines and see those as un-
avoidable problems of attending a large
university. They do feel that service could
have been improved to help customers.

“They simply were not prepared to
accommodate the thousands of students
that needed to purchase textbooks,” junior
pre-pharmacy major Trishelle Duke said.
“They deﬁnitely could have been better
prepared. Whether it was more training‘
for the employees or a better organization
of books, better preparations should have
been made.” I

Science andreligion can, should coexist

_ Daniel Okwaisie
‘ Columnist

The role of religion in developed,
progressive societies is -frequently
up for debate.i The past few weeiés
saw extensive_media coverage ofthis

tension,  beyond theyearly ‘ ‘
Lon cChri"s:t:Inas.”iYesterday, The

ing economy and those who would
rather that students receive more
instruction in traditional ethics and
character development.

A very similar ideological differ-
ence  underscored in the United
Statesfin 2Q12 when the Texas Board
of Education waspetitioned to ban
“critical thinking skills” from their
public schools. The religiously inﬂu-
enced petitioners believed critical
thinking instruction should end be-
cause it has no purpose but to modify
students’ behavior, challenge their
ﬁxed beliefs and undermine paren-

tal authority. The consequences of
eliminating critical thinking skills
from public school curricula could
extend to college and the workplace,
where the ability to think critically
is an asset.

Science and religion can peace-
ﬁilly coexist ifwe agree that both can
help provide answers to the many
questions we face as human be-
ings. These schools of thought can
be used to reinforce each other, as it
is possible to embrace science with-
out shirking one’s religious beliefs.
Countless religious traditions, like
Catholicism,Judaismland Hinduism,

ratherfocus on scientiﬁc and secular V

studies to bolster the country’s grow? -

of matter. l

The standpoint that humans exist
as a consequence of nature overlaps
with another philosophical option
between religion and science. Ni-
hilism is the secular philosophical '
standpoint that there is no inher-
ent purpose or meaning in life, thus-

' peo'pfle‘consnuct their own purpose.

H'“o'wever,f for many, this answer
just doesn’t cut it, given the deliberate
and intelligible manner in which lifea
works. Although many other altema—
tives to nihilism exist, religion histori-
cally has provenan especially popular
method of soothingthe curious mind
regarding the deep philosophical

c questions to which the accuracy of

scientiﬁc processes will always lack
a deﬁnite answer. Many religious
schools of thought provide a sense
of comfort that secular philosophies
might not.

Clearly, this tension can affect ‘

many aspects of day—to-day life,
both in the U.S. and abroad — even
in govemment. Last summer, Secre-
tary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack_said
that he got on his knees and said a
prayer for rain during a drought in
the Midwest that held many farmers
and their crops hostage foranumber
of months. Tom Flyrm, the executive
directorofthe Council for Secular Hu-

manism, charged that prayer doesn’t
work and that Vilsack’s praying con-
stituted the government practicing
religion and wallowing in supersti-
tion. Talk about overreaching. It’s
understandable that the Council for
Secular Humanism doesn’t believe
in prayer, but the secretary, who has
the right to pray, is an unnecessary
overextension that keeps science and
religion from coexisting.

Religious people sometimes also
create a barrier to philosophical co-
existence. The incident in Texas is a
perfect example of this type of situ-
ation. But when did it become a sin
to think critically? Many scientists
such as Einstein balanced religion,
science, skepticism and intensive
critical inquiry into one cohesive
belief system. The fear on the part
of religious parents and politicians
that teaching science strips people
oftheirfaith— as inTexas —- orthe
belief that decreasingscience educa-
tion to focus on morals will improve
society —— as in Indonesia — are un-
founded. People give up their faith
because they want to, not because
they are taught science, and people
can ﬁnd many paths to morality and
improving society.

Science and religioncanand must

‘ peacefully coexist. Schools should

give kids the chance to insert answers
for the numerous questions we face as
human beings without limiting their
critical  And for groups like
the petitioners in Texas who fear that
science erodes faith, I entreat them to
consider a quote by one of the great-
est scientists of all time, Isaac New-
ton, who believed in a God 0 “actions,
creating, preserving and govemingall
things  according to his good will
and pleasure.” An increased under-
standing of other points of view can
best help societies to thrive and move
forward. I

Impulse Editor

Before Tim Joy ﬁrst started writing
fan ﬁction 10 years ago, hewas work-
ing on an original story.

“I looked at it for the ﬁrst time the
other day, and well, let’s just say that
it will never see the light of day,”]oy
said in an e—mail.

Although not a well-known pub-
lished author,Joy is now the owner of
Fanﬁcauthors.net and afrequent fan
ﬁction contributor to the site under
the namejeconais.

Fan ﬁction is not new to popular
culture, but its fairly low proﬁle is
lately on the rise. Driven by responses
elicited from fans of original works,
fan ﬁction as aform of artistic expres-
sion is taking over the Internet, mak-
ing it difficult to read a popular book
or watch a blockbuster ﬁlm without
seeing a reaction to it.

As its title implies, fan ﬁction is
a form of artistic production under-
taken by fans of a particular literary
or cinematic work. Fan ﬁction writers
base their narratives on pre-existing
texts of all forms, using a popular au-
thor’s characters, setﬁng and themes
to continue the original author’s story
or produce their own. The secondary
works then often circulate among
other fans on the Internet, allowing

Fan fiction
story beyond ’ The End’

  

for endless permutations of a single
narrative concept. Fan ﬁction is not
limited solely to written ﬁction. It ex-
tends to movies, television and video
games, as well. V

Joy ﬁnds fan ﬁction to have an
“easy nature,” giving him and other
writers the opportunity to be more
proliﬁc in their writing. The canon,
or official work, acts as a guide. Read-
ers already know the characters and
plot, so the fan ﬁction author does
not need to take the time to introduce
everything.

“This, freedom lowers the barrier
of entry, and allows anyone with an
idea and some time the chance to
think of an idea and start to write
it,” he said. Joy’s creative writing
process is much like those of more
traditional authors: “It starts with
an idea,” he said.

“If the idea stays with me for a
week or more, ‘I’ll write a few thou-
sand words and see how the char-
acters are interacting, if the idea is
interesting, and if I can sustain it to a
new story. It’s avery small percentage
of ideas that I actually write in to full
stories,”_]oy said.

Mark Best, a lecturer in the Eng-
lish and ﬁlm studies departments at
Pitt, teaches a course in which he in-
corporates afan ﬁction lesson. He en-
courages students to search for their

   
 

extends

 

own examples of fan ﬁction online,
as fan ﬁction is circulated “primar-
ily through the Internet,” Best said.

“Students have found examples
of fan ﬁctionbased on anythingfrom
the life and lifestyles of different ce-
lebrities, the basis of ‘The Real World,’
real-life stuff, to sports, to fan ﬁction
written on solitaire,” Best explained.

Because fan ﬁction derives from
another piece of artistic expression,
the possibilities for its inspiration
are virtually endless. Fans who feel
passionately about any basic textcan
write lengthy narrative responses
that would then be termed fan ﬁc-
tion. There is only one criteria these
fans must follow: Their work must be
based off a formerly produced text,
rather than represent something
original. “They’re taking something
that’s already been created,” Best
said.

But as Joy notes, although it is
derived from previous works, fan
ﬁction still allows writers to create
something. It gives writers the chance

to expand their own ideas and receive _

feedback from other authors.

“Fan ﬁction authors (at least when
they start out) thrive on feedback,
and that feedback can be harsh —

far moreso regarding grammar and

for the popular white alternative. Similarly,
who1e—grain and wheat breads do well taking
the place of basic white.

If you don’t believe me, take this as an ex-
ample: picking a bowl over a burrito at Chipotle
saves you 260 calories from the removal of the
tortilla alone, and selecting brown rice instead
of white drops the count even more, according
to the Chipotle website.

Fats and oils are other large sources of
calories. Cutting these out of your diet is a bit
harder to do, but the easiest way is to limit the
amount of fried foods you choose to munch
on each week.

This can be done simply by avoiding fast-
food restaurants as much as possible. Pass-
ing up just a single McDonald’s Big Mac will
save you 550 calories, according to the chain’s
website. ’ t ' j ‘ ’

But cutting these highecalorie ‘foods out
of your diet isn’t enough. You can’t just starve
yourself to lose weight. You have to eat some-
thing, so it’s best to replace these foods with

low—calorie alternatives. That’s why this year, .

I’m resolving to cook more often and eat out
less.

By cooking things for myself, I can easily
control the amount of calories that I’m eating
at each meal, unlike dishes prepared by the
average Oakland eatery.

I’d like to start by adding more vegetarian
meals to my diet. Many vegetarian dishes are
also low—calorie, as meat contains signiﬁcantly

more calories than most fruits and vegetables. ,

Notable exceptions to this are beans and pota-
toes, although these oﬁen still contain-fewer
calories than most meats_.__Somelrnight equate
vegetarianism with eatingliai lot of salads, but
I’m thinking of dishes such as veggie burgers:
and hearty vegetable soups (meat broths don’t
contain nearly as many calories as the meats
themselves, so no guilt there). Both of these
have the added appeal ofbeing freezable, which
translates directly to leftovers.

For seafood lovers, like myself, many types
of ﬁsh contain fewer calories than meats and
can be broiled or grilled instead of fried. I love
to pick up fresh ﬁsh ﬁlets from the grocery store
and broil them with slices of lemon laid over
top. The juice from the lemon will help keep‘
the ﬁlets moist and adds delicious ﬂavor to the
ﬁsh. Paired with some fresh steamed or grilled

vegetables (pro tip: also give them a squeeze of
lemon juice), you’ve got a well—balanced meal
that can be thrown together quicker than you
can read this newspaper.

I’m not going to lie to anyone, cutting back
on food that you love is a challenge. It’s truly
going to be a ﬁght for me to go without tvvice—
weekly trips to Chipotle and late-night Sushi
Boat runs. But with just a little effort on your
part, you can begin to make small changes that
will have big impacts over time. And if you prac-
tice your cooking skills, you can replace your
eat—out favorites with delicious dine—at—home

spelling than anything else. So you are forced
to learn the rules you didn’t pay attention to at
school,”]oy wrote in an email.

Best understands the importance of fan
ﬁction, but he’s clear to note the difference
between it and original artistic production.

“It’s like apples and oranges,” he said.

Fan ﬁlm, another outlet for enthusiasts,
takes an approach similar to that of written
fan ﬁction but applies its elaborations to ﬁlm.
Neepa Majumdar, professor of ﬁlm studies,
also incorporates the subject into her semester-
long course.

“[Fan ﬁlm] is any ﬁlm that takes as a start-

ing point an existing ﬁlm and either uses im-
ages from them and adds a new soundtrack,
or makes a new ﬁlm that pays tribute to or
critiques it,” Majumdar said.

Unlike fan ﬁction, fan ﬁlm has much more
recent origins, and has exploded on the Inter-
net with the help of certain video—based sites.
As fan ﬁlms are most frequently based off of
popular franchises, they are closely related to
the parody short, but according to Majumdar,
there’s one important difference. Fan ﬁlm is “a

loving parody, not meant to put down the origi— .,

nal. Everybody recognizes it,” the professor
noted. “Fan ﬁlm and parody, they overlap a lot.”

ily available to everyone than it has been in the
past, ﬁlm production has drastically increased.

' Anyone with a camera on their phone could ﬁlm

a short movie and upload it almost immediately.

“One thing is clear, that the short ﬁlm is in
some ways more proliﬁc than our standard
feature—length ﬁlm,” Majumdar said. “Most
people watch, on average, one short ﬁlm per
day.”

The ubiquitous nature of short ﬁlms and
the ready availability of ﬁlming equipment his
gives fans the opportunity to develop their own
creative response to a previous work through
the short ﬁlm.

“It’s exploded now that people have the

means of making them at their ﬁngertips,”
Majumdar said.

Forfans who feel passionately about a tele-
vision show or novel, it isn’t uncommon for
them to create their own form of expression
in response.

And the ﬁrst time these reactions began
was in a galaxy far, far away.

“People say that the ﬁrst ﬁlms that elicited
this sort of fan involvement were the ‘StarWars’
ﬁlms,” Majumdar said. Today, ﬁlm reactions
exist for almost every popular franchise, in-
cluding “The Lord of the Rings,” “Star Trek”
and even the popularized and highly—parodied
“Twilight” series.

In the case of “Twilight,” fan ﬁction ex-
tended from amateur creation and became
mainstream. The “Fifty Shades of Grey” series

began as a response to the “Twilight” fran-
chise. Originally writing simply as a pastime,
E.L.]ames chose to strip her books of their
fan—ﬁction quality in order to publish them as
separate entities. She invented her own char-
acters — Christian and Anna — and rewrote
her books substantially to distinguish them
from the “Twilight” series.

Although the use of another author’s char-
acters and story concept would normally raise
signiﬁcant copyright issues, fan ﬁctionewriters
can typically avoid legal issues as long as their
work is not distributed for proﬁt. For “Fifty
Shades of Grey,” James had to signiﬁcantly
change her reaction into its own franchise to
separate it fromfanﬁction. V

“While it started as ‘Twilight’ fan ﬁction,
it’s not that anymore,” Best said. “To become

something different, something publishable, it
had to stop being ‘Twilight’ fan ﬁction.”

Perhaps because of its racy themes and
tales of sexual exploits, “Fifty Shades of Grey”
reached a larger audience than usual for fan
ﬁction. Once James made her work original
ﬁction, a wider variety of readers were able to
indulge in the adult literature. ‘

Best explained that these themes are often
examined in fan ﬁction.

“Fan ﬁction allows that [sexual] area to be
explored. You’re not going to have a lot of sex on
mainstream primetime TV shows. Fan ﬁction
allows you to do that,” Best said. 7

But despite the mainstream popularity of
James’ books, fan ﬁction still exists largely as
an alternative hobby.

Joy didn’t disagree. ’

“Fan ﬁction is a hobby, and as such, should
be firm and stress free,” he said.

Joy explained that the main purpose offan
ﬁction is entertainment. Those who wantjto
continue the end of a storyolrlalre 
an author to release sometlﬁngieriéw 
create their own stories. ti 7, ' :

“I also think that it has a small role to play
in keeping a level of interest in the original
author’s work,” he said. I g  b

Although the visibility of fan ﬁctionis in-
creasing, the phenomenon still exists mainly
online.. V 2 A  y —

“Fan ﬁction is typically amateur in both
the sense of who’s making it and how it’s being

distributed,” Best said. As such,~it’s heldltola ‘

separate set of standards than original works,

and put it outthere and that’s great. It_’s very

    
   

; democratic. But if anyone can do it, then ‘anyone

with bad writing or ideas and writing skills
can do it. The quality is often really dubious.”
. Despite fan ﬁctign’s amateur nature, Best
ﬁnds major production companies open to a
response from fans. “The fact is, many com-
panies producing material are far more open
to fan input. So fans have much more of a say,
and there is a much greater desire to cater to
‘the fan base,” Best said.

“It’s very simple, and most interesting.
You’re taking something that you really love
and care about and doing what you want with
it,” Best said, noting that fan ﬁction gives fans
free reign to manipulate and expand on virtu-
ally any artistic production.

And with the Internet readily available for
virtually anyone, nearly everyone has the op-
portunity to participate in the production of
fan ﬁction likejoy and the other writers on fan
ﬁction websites.

A BASKETBALL

Lamar Patterson (21) is one of the Panthers who has struggled offensively. Anthony Gima| For,The Pitt News

Nate Barnes
Stqff‘ Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team
travels to the Verizon Center

in Washington, D.C., Tuesday
night to do battle with Big East
foe Georgetown, as each squad
continues to pursue its ﬁrst win
in conference play.

The Panthers (12-3, 0-2
Big East)carry two consecu-
tive conference losses into the
matchup, the most recent being
a disappointing performance on
the road at Rutgers. Likewise,
the No. 19 Hoyas (10-2, 0-1 Big
East) came up short in their
last outing, which resulted in a
one—point loss to Marquette on
Saturday.

The Panthers allowed 67
and 70 points against Rutgers
and Cincinnati, respectively
— something that didn’t go
unnoticed by head coach Jamie

Dixon.

“We’re just not getting it
done, and our defense is the
thing that stands out,” Dixon
said Saturday after the game.

Additionally, Pitt will need
to improve on the glass after
both Rutgers and Cincinnati
out-rebounded the Panthers.
Dixon called Pitt’s rebounding
struggles “a hard thing to com-
prehend.” The Scarlet Knights
tallied a 31-21 advantage over
Pitt on the boards, while Cincin-
nati ﬁnished at 30-27. Redshirt
junior big man Talib Zanna
couldn’t explain the difﬁculty
the players have experienced.

“I don’t know what the prob-
lem is,” Zanna said. “We have to
keep trying.”

Their fortunes might im-
prove against a Georgetown
team ranked 255th nationally in
rebounds per game, with 33.2.
Pitt averages 34.9.

Although Georgetown ranks

Pitt looks for answers as it
prepares for No. 19 Georgetown

No. 235 in the nation scoring-
wise at 65.1 points per game,
Pitt will still face a challenge in
the talented Hoyas trio of Otto
Porter ]r., Greg Whittington and
Markel Starks. ’
Whittington and Porter will
provide the interior presence
for Georgetown, while Starks
will provide scoring from the
perimeter. Whittington cur-
rently averages 12.6 points per
game along with 7.4 rebounds.
Starks ranks third on the team
with 11.7 points per game.
Starks will require the focus
of Pitt’s perimeter defend-
ers and will likely see himself
matched up with, Pitt’s best
perimeter defender, fresh-
man James Robinson. In both
Big East games thus far, the
opposition’s guards burned
the Panthers, with Cincinnati’s

A GRAIN OF SAUL

NFL season in review and

  postseason predictions

Isaac Saul
Senior Staff Writer

Back in a column I wrote in No-
vember, I made a few bold pre-
dictions for the remainder of the
NFL season.

' Now, with the ﬁrst round of
the playoffs complete, I get to
gloat, apologize and extend some
thoughts on the remaining teams
vying for the Lombardi Trophy.

L Firstly, I’d like to send a spe-
cial thank you to Mr. Ben Roeth-
lisberger, who helped bring to
fruition my prediction that the

. Steelers would missthe playoffs.

Roethlisberger stayed hurt just
long enough for the Steelers to fall
behind, and played just stupidly
enough for them to fall short of
a late-season comeback in their
week—16 loss to Cincinnati.

Next, I’d like to thank and scold
Roger Goodell and the NFL for
dropping the suspensions against
the two Seattle Seahawks corner-
backs who faced charges for using
Adderall back in November. I’d
like to thank you, Mr. Goodell, for
reinforcing my point that the NFL
can no longer make a worthwhile
suspension. However, I’d like to
scold you because the aforemen-
tioned cornerbacks torched my
Washington Redskins on Sunday.
Which brings me to my next point:

I owe Russell Wilson an apol-
ogy. Back in that column in No-
vember, I said the NFL’s best
rookie quarterback would get
torched in the playoffs. I made
that claim, and then supported it
by explaining why Robert Griﬂin
III and Andrew Luck didn’t have
enough around them to win in the
playoffs. I completely neglected
the idea that Wilson would, at
this point in the season, be both
the best rookie quarterback and
be playing on the hottest team in
the league. 4

Although RG3’s season (but
hopefully not his career) ended on
Sunday, he did play well enough
to pull off a late-season rally re-
sulting in the Redskins’ division
win —~ which I predicted would
come down to them and the Gi-
ants. Obviously, the Cowboys got
involved and shook things up, but
the Redskins did win the division,

which I had full conﬁdence in af- ,,_,

ter their win over New York a few
weeks ago.

As for what is ahead, I need
only the San Francisco 49ers to
fall apart to complete my predic-
tion that they and the Chicago
Bears would fail to win a play-
off game. The Bears will watch
the playoffs in their entirety as
spectators, and the 49ers will be
coming off a bye week — but have
to face Aaron Rodgers, the most

experienced NFC quarterback still _ _

in the playoffs.

With those failures and suc-
cesses in the books, I’d like to of-
fer some predictions for the ﬁnal
weeks of this exciting NFL season.

The Green Bay Packers will
face the Atlanta Falcons in the
NFC Championship game. Man, as
tough as it is to bet against the Se-
ahawks, I have to go with my gut
here. In big games like this, I al-
ways bet on the best quarterback.

In this case, that’s Matt Ryan. I .

think the Falcons are due to get
over the hump, and their home-
ﬁeld advantage will be just enough
to squeeze one out. The Seattle
bandwagon is an easy one to jump
on, and I may eat my words for
letting it pull out of the station
without me.

As for the 49ers, I just don’t
think they’re the better team this
year. The Packers have gotten hot
just at the right time, and Colin

Kaepernick has looked rather pe- »

destrian since his ﬁery start at
the helm for San Francisco. I see
the Packers winning by at least
two scores.

Peyton Manning will return to

the Super Bowl. (Disclaimer: I am 4

the ultimate Manning fan boy. I
thought Indianapolis should have
re—signed him. I thought Denver
made the biggest off-season move
of this millennium by getting him.
I guaranteed he’d be back in the
playoffs after landing in Denver.
And now, after 18 weeks of foot-
ball, he has done everything to
inspire my absolute conﬁdence
in him.)

The Broncos have won 11

straight games and they will get V

to face an old and embattled Ra-

vens team that has dropped one too many

games it should have won for me to be-

* *lieve in them. After that, it’ll be either a

New England team with a soft defense or a

Houston team that limped into the playoffs.
Either way, I got Denver.

The big game: In my eyes, only one

matchup seems “probable,” and that’s

t» Green Bay and Denver. Last year, the

Packers underperformed when everyone ‘

thought they’d run away with the league.
Now, the team has a chip on its shoulder
and the players have lost enough to play
with the humble kind of motivation that
builds championship teams.

Atlanta and Seattle still just strike me
as being too young to get it done.

On the AFC side, I have to do something
I never do: doubt Tom Brady. How could I?
The manhas proved himself to be a magi-
cian in the playoffs, and when the game is

,.on the line it’s hard to ﬁnd another quar-
terback in NFL history you’d rather have
the ball. The problem is, I think Manning
just might be that guy.

While Brady and the Patriots are trying
to make their ﬁrst visit to the big game
since blowing their undefeated season
against the Giants, Manning is ready to
prove to the world his career didn’t end
in rehab. I think he’s the better quarter-
back and I think he’s playing for something

Down 1Q,the Redskins turned the ball over late in the game on this play. MCT Campus

special this year, and that’s why I’ve got
Denver rolling over New England and then
eventually Green Bay.

points and Rutgers’ Eli Carter notching
23 on Saturday.

Porter, a projected NBA Draft pick
come April, has been a jack—of-all trades
for Georgetown thus far. Porter leads
the team in points (13.2), rebounds (7.5),
steals (2), and blocks (1.3).

A key for Pitt will be to limit the effec-
tiveness of Porter and Whittington, while
keeping players like Zanna and Steven
Adams involved in the offensive ﬂow.
Against Rutgers, the Scarlet Knights held
Zanna — Pitt’s leading scorer —— to only
nine points and Adams to eight while
keeping the two players off the glass.

On the offensive end, Travon Wood-
all’s play will likely dictate how the
Panthers will perform. So far in Big East

play, the redshirt senior is averaging 10
points per game, but shooting only 30
percent from the ﬁeld. The rest of Pitt’s
offense also stagnated for long stretches-
against Cincinnati and Rutgers.

And of course, it will help if the
Panthers can prevent the Hoyas from
jumping out to an early lead as Rutgers
did Saturday, when the Scarlet Knights
held a 15-5 advantage before Pitt knew
what hit it. I
