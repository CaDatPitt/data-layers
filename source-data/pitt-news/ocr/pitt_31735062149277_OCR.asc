A new and impressive feature of
the annual Women’s Day program

ferent fields.

More than one-ﬁfth of the women
pictured are outstanding in the ﬁeld
of medicine, another one-ﬁfth in ed-
ucation, three in law, and the re-
mainder in ﬁelds of government,

any, and physics.

In law there were two judges,

pointed judge in the County Court;
and Sara Soffel, who was elected
judge of the County Court for a ten-
year term in 1931.

Martha Macdonald, director of the

Guidance Center of New Orleans In-
stitute of Mental Hygiene, Zoe Alli--
son Johnson, distinguished in radio-
logical circles, Eleanor H. Balph, and
Isabel M. Balph.

Two deans of women, Charlotte E.

tured.

Other educators in the group were
Mrs. Agnes Lynch Starrett, assistant
professor of English at the Univer-
sity; Louise Patterson, headmistress
at Sandia schools; Esther VVilliams,

5 Enquiry Review

I .

illphold Labor

I
By Ruggero Aldisert

l

! In a blanket defense of the present
[National Labor Relations Act, Stew-
{art Sherman, Pittsburgh ﬁeld exam-
'iner for the labor board, told Mon-
;day’s Inquiry Forum audience that
'there is no need for amending the
Wagner Act, that the board is not
;biased toward any particular union,
and that certain employers’ rights do
exist under the present set-up.

Investigator for NLRB

Attorney Sherman, a two-year vet-
eran of the NLRB who has investi-
gated cases for the regional ofﬁces in
Georgia, New York, Wisconsin, and
Pennsylvania, based his opinions on
statistics compiled by; the Central
Board of the NLRB dhd from person-
al experiences.

Outlining the arguments charged
against the board he is employed by,
Mr. Sherman believes that much of
the agitation and criticism against it
is due to nothing but “stark ignor-
ance of the act.”

Employers Cannot Petition

He pointed out that the National
.Association of Manufacturers oppose
,the' NLRB because they claim that
the employers cannot petition for an
election. According to Sherman, the
Babson Statistical association reveals
that less than four per cent of the
employers wish to be able to peti-
tion.

“I can see no advantage of em-
ployers doing this,” stated Sherman,
“unless they want to circumvent the
action of the employees.”

Another charge raised against the
NLRB is that it acts as investigator,
prosecutor, witness, and judge, of a
case.

lliorum Audience Hears~“'Sl1erman
Board’s Decisions

In defending his “half truth and
confusing issue,” Attorney Sherman
went into great detail explaining the
process of labor hearings, stressing
that trial examiners (who otﬁciate as
judges) and ﬁeld examiners (the in-
vestigating attorneys) have little
personal contact with one another.
He revealed that board ofﬁcials are
constantly being shifted to different
regional offices.

Admitting that the NLRB was
deﬁnitely “pro labor,” he maintained
that such a law was an absolute
necessity to counteract “the coercion
of the employers.” He detailed how
under previous labor laws, it was
possible for employers to draw out
cases for years to the point that when
a decision was made it was not even
enforceable.

Laws Lacked Teeth

“Many of our previous laws were
wishy—washy. They had no teeth in
them. They were purely voluntary
situations. Then came the LIRA
which created a whole drove of in-
dependent unions, which were com-
pany-dominated. It remained for the
Wagner Act to come along and con-
tain penal clauses which made possi-
ble an effective labor board.”

In the discussion period which fol-
lowed his half hour speech, Sherman
was asked what his opinion was on
the recent controversy over the re-
appointment of Donald Wakeﬁeld
Smith to the Central Board of the
NLRB. Sherman replied that al-
though Smith is charged with being
biased toward the CIO the bulk of
his rulings have favored the AFL.

Men’s Council

Presents a Plan

MEN’S COUNCIL, that offspring of 809 which
‘L has been meeting regularly once a month for
the last couple of years now, has ﬁnally hit upon
something vital.

\Ve’re referring to the recently-announced plans
for revision of the eighth ﬂoor into an all-men’s
ﬂoor recently approved in Council session and sub-
mitted to administrative ofﬁcials for consideration.

St.i1dent organizations have been hampered too
long by lack of proper facilities for holding meet-
ings, social affairs, and similar events. They have
become tired and disgusted at being told that
downstairs Tuck shop facilities, privately operated,
are not available to student groups who might want-
to serve refreshments, of paying rental fees for
other campus eating facilities, ostensibly run for
student beneﬁt, of being forced to meet in class-
rooms and similar places poorly equipped.

A new men’s ﬂoor, which, according to Men’s
Council plans, would include a lounge, entertain-
ment liall, “trophy room,” and other possible con-
veniences, would help considerably to remedy these
conditions. Not only would it serve to centralize
and thus make more efficient the administration of
int-.n’s activities, as has been achieved to a certain
extent by the 12th floor for women, but it would
also provide meeting facilities for honoraries and
other campus orphan groups.

Obvious answerto all these problems, of course,
is a student union building, which would house all
facilities for eating, activities, social aﬁairs, and all
those extra-curricular activities which help to bal-
ance the academic side of college life. Such a plan,
which both students and Administration recognize
as worthwhile and necessary, nevertheless, will
require both considerable time and money.

As an-example of what can be accomplished with-

case of Carnegie Tech, which has recently con-
verted a large private home into quite adequate
and highly-appreciated student union quarters.

Tho Chancellor Holds
‘Fireside Chats’

N A RECENT issue of the News a short item
stated that John G. Bowman, Chancellor of the
Uiiiversity, has set aside two hours a week during
which students may go into his office to talk to him.
These. incetings are to be informal discussion
groups in which the Chaiicellor and the students
can become acquainted.

In our opinion, the women of the NVSGA Su-
promo court, rate commendation for arranging with
the Cliaiicellor to do this. Many students have ex-
pressed a desire to see and talk to Dr. Bowman,
but they were hesitant about doing anything
about it‘.

. In fact, he was considered by many to be so far
removed from their sphere of activity that the only
conditions under which he could be seen were the
very rare occasions when he talked to the student
body.

The students agree unanimously, we believe, that
the Chancellor should be known to them as an
individual, not as a person who is so little known
that he has seemed at times to be only a legend.

It may be that part of the criticism to which he
or his policies have been subjected in the past can
be attribilted to the fact that it is much easier for
the students to ﬁnd fault with some one whom they
do not know and therefore do not understand than
it is to criticize some one whom they are ac-
quainted.

One of the first things Britain ’s Anthony Eden
did when he arrived in New York was to attend
the new coinedy-music:-11 “Hellzapoppin.” Making
literal interpretation, it looks to us like a new ver-
sion of the old gag about the mailman taking a
walk on his day oﬁt".

THE QUESTION‘:

What do you regard to be the
essence of President Roosevelt’s
message. to Congress?

,,  

THE ANSWER:
Marion Kamin, L41.

I believe that the president’s mes-
sage was a step toward international
cooperation against dictatorships of
Europe. I feel, however, that the
president’s foreign policy is not a
very consistent one as is evidenced by
the farce of our neutrality laws.

Much as I disapprove of Hitler I
feel that the president could better
strengthen America and keep this
country out of war by less negative
interference.

Bill Angel, BA39.
The keynote was for party sol-
idarity. The president’s armament
ideas are a natural consequence of

- his being aiﬁliated with the Navy

department. By his rcarmament

program he expects to ﬁght the de-

pression as well as foreign foes.
Mark Swirsky, BA39.

Mr. Roosevelt’s attitude towards the
I-Iitlers of Europe—In the words of
Dorothy Parker, “lnseparable, nose
and thumb.”

J. L. Garrow, L39.

The whole essence seems to be
the foreign situation and he spoke
little of internal problems so it ap-
pears that he is not going to con-
centrate on problems at home for
the next year.

Roosevelt seems to be taking a
cue from the foreign leaders as to
his method of solidifying his party;
that method being using a foreign
war as a means of detracting the
people’s attention from problems at
home to problems abroad.

Louis Corbin, BA39.

I think it was a very sweet politi-
cal gesture. He is not selling arma-
ments but he is selling Roosevelt.

I don“: think there is an actual
need for armaments to protect us
from outside aggression but there is
a danger of the cultural offensive
from within by factions of commun-
ism and nazism. Mr. Roosevelt might
use his armaments against these
forces.

Dan J. Snyder, L40.

The spirit of prcgressivism must
go forward on all fronts and re-
trenchment is fatal to democracy
. . This to me was the message
with Mr. Roosevelt’s message to
Congress.

f E May Point ...

.  By Robert Saﬁron

As I was remarking to my friend Legion the other
day, the mood at the present time is one of despair,
disillusionment, and betrayal.

Now take the case of the.Ame1'ican Student Union,
of which I and thousands of others were once mem-
bers. For several years, it was the only genuine pro-
gressive group on the nation’s campuses, working for
democracy in the schools, aid to students, opposition to
militarism, and in general attempted to orient us callow
youth toward a constructively critical philosophy. One
which we will most certainly need when We are thrown
out of school with our diplomas gripped tightly, and
singing “Pie In the Sky.”

The ASU slogan was “make the campus a fortress of
democracy.” After the convention held in New York
during the Christmas holidays, it may as well change
the cry to: “the carnpus—a fortress.”

Tragic Fallacy

“The time has come when democracy must be saved,
not by school, but by guns,” was the keynote enunciated
by Bert Witt, secretary for the New York district. In
spite of the efforts of some delegates who had heard of
that tragic fallacy before (called “paciﬁsts” by the con-
vention leaders) the ASU peace resolution declares:

, “We request that the ROTC undertake a review of its
material and personnel so that there may be no doubt
of the devotion of the ROTC to democracy We
welcome the announcement made yesterday of the ex-
perimental program in the training of student pilots.”

They forgot that the last time the ROTC revised its
army manual, it removed the paragraph which deﬁned
democracy as “mobocracy, leading to rule by the mob.”
And the idea of training 20,000 pilots a year, when we
don’t even have that many planes, was even too much
for General “Tin-pants” Johnson to take lying down.

Apron-String Policy

It has tied itself deﬁnitely to the apron-strings of
the New Deal, which so far has shown little indication
of being able to cope for the ﬁve million or so unem-
ployed of our age: “We must unite the campus for the
objectives of the New Deal.”

And so once more the tumult and the shouting dies,
and the captains and the kings depart from the ﬁeld.

The only note of relief is that almost 70 per cent of
the representatives were from the New York district:
the polls of student opinion throughout the country do
not quite jibe with what the ASU now presents.

But that small group who left the organization last
year in disagreement with its militaristic “collective se-
curity” program has now been vindicated. There is no
longer any room in the ASU for any student who seeks
peace, freedom, and prosperity without the auspices of
the Roosevelt administration.

Fditor. The Pitt News
Dear Sir:

Another Woman’s Day is over, and .7-.g:iin ‘hr-2 women
have succeeded in effectively proving xltat ‘.hey do not
consider ‘themselves to be on an equal status witli zhe
men.

It seems that, like a person with an inferiority com-
plex who makes a lot of noise to cover up a feeling ';l1at
he is not as good as the other people, the women raise :1
clamor on every anniversary of any event in which
women played an important part as if they do not teci
secure in their new-found positions, and must neces-
sarily let eve ‘yone know that they are around doing
right well by themselves.

It would seem also that the men might very natur-
ally resent such action, and might get slightly tired of
' the women continually complimenting them-
After all, there is no rnen’s day and has never
. and the women by observing such days od-
thcy are not the equals of the men simply be-
cause they insist on having a day especially set aside
for them, a day in which they extend their monopoly of
the, activities es.ablished for them to include those in
which they generally participate on an equal status
with the men.

It is time that women not only of Pitt but also of the
entire -stir.~:1 stopped blowing a horn which has become
slightly tinny from so much use.

Persons who perpetually pat themselves on the back
dcn’t inspire others to give them responsibility. Per-
haps that is why there has always been so much oppo-
sition to women taking over certain positions fcrinerly
occupied by men.

Staﬂ Wants Tapped

By BILL MAZEFSKY

Soinetiines when you write a slight feature for the sports depart-
ment of a collegiate paper, the assignments become a triﬂe odd. Some-
times you are told to get everybody ’s opinion on who’s going to win
what game; or you interview a Greek wrestler who has given up his
career for a higher education and thinks that the twenty-seventh. ‘floor

of the Cathedral is high enough. 9

Or you investigate an organization
of third string footballers from Tech,
who call themselves the Siberians.
VVe have found these lads quite in-
teresting. First of all they have nine
vice presidents. The only organiza-
tions that have so many vice presi-
dents are vast ﬁnancial institutions,

or a president of wealthy ﬁrm who
has nine son-in—laws.

The president of these eleven foot-
ballers is Paul Freedlander who dur-
ing_the past season made the ac-
quaintance of one John Getchel.
(They should’ve have made him a
vice president. He isn’t a son-in-law
but, in his way, he proved quite
troublesome).

Mel Cratsley has been named sec-
retary. The other nine members of
the third string outﬁt have been
made vice presidents, despite their
lack of father-in-laws.

The role of faculty advisor falls to
Joseph “Muggsy” Skladany, a former
All-American Pitt end, and at pres-
ent the Tech line coach. Because

they have spent so much time. on the
sidelines, and therefore out in the
cold, these footballers just pi-cked
up the name Siberians.

Theirs is the Alpha chapter of an
organization which they hope will
spread over the country. (That vice
president business still intrigues us).
We have a suggestion for a Beta
chapter.

Sports writers spend a lot of time
on the sidelines. They lurk behind a
typewriter and make comments, but
they’re still on the sidelines—out in
the cold. They never get clipped in
the teeth by ﬂying leather. They
never get tackled by two hundred
pounds of ﬂying guard.‘ They are
never swatted in the face by a ﬂying
hockey stick. Yep, they're out in
the cold. Siberians, as it were.

Therefore, we would suggest that
these Tartan football players con-
sider the Pitt sports staﬁ as a poten-
tial Beta chapter of the Amalgamated
Order of Siberians. Anything, to be
:1 vice president.

PAGE THREE

By Bill McElwain

\Vith the cry “Remember
Yale l’.’ on their lips, Pitt ’s hockey
team skates out on the Duquesne
Garden ice against Carnegie Tech
tomorrow night in an effort to re-
gain a part of the prestige that

was their’s before the Ivy Leaguers
hit town.

The Panthers aren’t ashamed of
their showing against the Bulldogs
for the big blue team is rated as one
of the nation’s outstanding collegiate
ice contingents, but some few defects
which have bothered Pitt all season
appeared more glaring in the bril-
liancy of the Yales.

Feiler A Star

Whether the Mcsorleymen will be
an improved outﬁt this evening re-
mains to be seen, but regardless, they
must be favored to win and retain
their league lead. Even at full
strength, the Tartans have been an
up and down team.

Minus Center Jack Culver and
Wing Amant, the Skibos’ promise to
be none too formidable. Culver has
been the steadying ﬁgure in the front
line of Culver, Burley, and Shilawske,
and with both Culver and Amant
shelved by scholastic troubles, Tech’s
attack should be on the feeble side.

But the Panthers will have no easy
time if Carnegie’s defense is as strong
as it was against Duquesne.
covering up by the line combined
with vicious body checking tactics
by the defense slowed the Dukes con-
siderably while sensational goal tend-
ing by Fred Feiler took care of all but
one Duquesne shot.

Bad Boys

Against such a defense, Pitt will be
forced to show more scoring punch
than has been demonstrated recently.
The star pony line of Schooley, Fri-
day, and Brittain has been held score-
less for the last two games, Defense-
man Lenny Broida notching the only
score against Case.

Chief factors in the Tech’s defen-:
sive Strength have been Goldsmithl
and Havlische back of the blue line
and Feiler in goal. The Tartan de-
fenders are not the cleanest players
in the league but they are deﬁnitely
efficient.

Feiler has improved with every
game, while Goldsmith, although
gaining a reputation of a “bad boy,”
has proved more than successful in
clearing attackers out of the area in
front of the Kiltie net.

Cusick Improves

Either Wilson or Whitey Block will
move up from the second team to
join Burley and Shilawske on the
Tech starting line. Having played
without Culver for two games. the
Plaid may have gained enough ex-
perience to give the Panthers a busy
36 minutes.

The Pitt icers will probably open
with their regular lineup of Irv Artz,
Bob Lowe, and Bill Schildecker on
the line, Lovett and Shiring back on
defense, and Bud Ellis tending goal.
The Brittain, Schooley, and Friday
trio should make an early appearance
if the starting six continues to show

their lethargic goal getting eﬁorts. l

Chuck Conick and Len Broida will
serve as relief for the Shiring-Lovett
duo while handyman Pat Cusick will
ﬁll in where necessary. The smiling
redhead has come along remarkably
since the ﬁrst game, and threatens to
push one or two of the regulars out of
a steady job.

Against Tartans

Phi Gamma Delta Holds
All-Point Cup Advantage;
Wins Points In Volleyball

Phi Kappa Ends Kappa Sigma Cagers’
Victory String, Holds Unbeaten Status

By Bert Jaﬁe
Phi Gamma Delta continues in ﬁrst place in the quest for the
“All Point” trophy at the conclusion of the week-end activities.
Scheduled to do battle in both ping pong and volleyball, the
Fijis arrived at Trees Gym to ﬁnd their opponents in both sports on

the absentee list.

Phi Kappa tripped Kappa Sigina from the undefeated ranks in

basketball last Friday, winning by a¢

decisive margin, 40-16. There seems
to be little opposition to the Craig
Streeters in the hard wood sport.

However, the Fijis are also unde-
feated in basketball and the meeting
between these two teams early next
semester might prove to be the decid-
ing contest for the basketball cham-
pionship.

Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha Mu,

and Pi Kappa Alpha are within strik- '

ing distance of the leaders with only
one defeat each marring their rec-
crds.

First place in the ping pong league
is practically cinched by Delta Tau
Delta with 54 victories and 6 defeats
to its credit. Phi Kappa is situated in
second place at the present time.

It is doubtful whether the Phi Kaps
will continue to hold this position as
they have yet to meet the powerful
Delt team, Sigma Alpha Mu, Phi Ep-
silon Pi, and Pi Lambda Phi, four
of the ﬁrst ﬁve teams.

In volleyball the Phi Gams have
not lost a single contest in 12 starts.
Phi Delta Theta is also undefeated in
six games, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
has a perfect slate, playing only
three games to date.

. Pi Lambda Phi and Phi Epsilon Pi
are resting behind the undefeated
leaders in Volleyball with eight wins
and one loss, and seven triumphs and
two defeats, respectively.

The leadership in bowling is a
three way tie with Phi Delta Theta,
Theta Chi, and Sigma Chi, all of
Dithridge Street, maintaining an av-
erage of .889 as the result of eight
victories in nine chances.

Three volleyball contests are card-
ed this afternoon, bringing together
Phi Gamma Delta and Pi Kappa
Alpha at 4:00; Delta Tau Delta and
Pi Lambda Phi at 3:00; and Phi Delta
Theta opposing Phi Epsilon Pi at 5:00.

Both Phi Delta Theta and Phi
Gamma Delta will be risking their
perfect record today. The Pi Lams
will attempt to gain lost prestige from
the Delts who have already taken

them over in football, ping pong, and
bowling.

The three bowling leaders are fav-
ored to come out victorious at the
Strand Alleys tonight. Sigma Chi
should have a difficult time with the
Delts, but its experienced ﬁve is ex-
pected to take at least two of the
three matches.

Theta Chi and Phi Delta Theta look
like good bets to cop all three matches
from Phi Epsilon Pi and Pi Kappa
Alpha.

Other bowling matches include
Sigma Alpha Mu stacking up against
Kappa Sigma with the winner a toss
up; Lambda Chi, the underdog in its
match with Sigma Alpha Epsilon;
and Phi Gamma Delta against Phi
Kappa with neither team breaking
any records in the bowling league.

However, the three points that go
to the winners of each match will
provide a lively tussle between these
two houses.

Coaching Post

Second resignation in the ranks
of the University’s football coaching
staff was revealed recently when the
withdrawal of Harold “Josh” Wil-
liams was made public.

A star running halfback at Pitt
during his undergraduate days, Wil-
liams received his diploma in ’31,
after which he assumed the head
coaching post at Beaver high school.
In the spring of 1937 he was called
back to the campus as a backﬁeld
coach.

Williams’ resignation is the sec-
ond since the gridiron season closed.

Mrs. Woodhouse Claims

Custom Hampers Women

Speaker Stresses .
Economic Equality;

I

In Business Field 
By Freda Jaﬁ'e' 

“I believe tradition is holding}
back women,” said Mrs. Chasei
Going \Voodhouse, in her speech;
to undergraduate coeds and;
alumnae, at Stephen Foster Me-y
morial Monday. 5
Urging women to break these nar-
Woodhouse

row traditions, Mrs.
claimed. “We have privileges, but
not equality.”

The belief that women are merely
a temporary group in the employ-
ment situation, the tendency to think
of women as a homogenous class’
rather than as individuals, the “tra-
dition of a secretarial complex” or a
helper attitude, are all obsolete tra-
ditions, Mrs. Woodhouse pointed out.

In addition, said Mrs. Woodhouse,
“We ourselves are critical of women
in professions.” She pointed out that
women are more apt to trust and pa-
tronize a man dentist or doctor than
a woman dentist or doctor. Another
worthless tradition, she stated, is the
assumption that women have no de-
pendents, and hence should receive
smaller wages than men.

Mrs. Woodhouse then went on to
list several practical suggestions for
breaking these traditions. She
stressed the necessity of breaking
down tradition through education,
especially through the education of
boys.

Furthermore, according to Mrs.
Woodhouse, women should enter new
ﬁelds for careers and should support
the merit system for awarding jobs.

“Do away with mass apprehen-
siveness and bring about personal se-
curity,” went on the speaker of the
afternoon. Touching in the conclu-
sion of her speech on the present day
world situation, Mrs. Woodhouse
pointed out that because of the close
relationship between democracy and
the status of women, the latter should
interest themselves in public affairs.

Faculty Members
Publish Articles

The annual report of the Graduate
School, recently published, reveals
that the members of the University
faculty made numerous written con-i
tributions to arts, science, and letters
during the 1938 season.

Nineteen members of the faculty
write and published 24 books during
the year. Members of the faculty al-
so served as editors of association
magazines and journals.

Statistics in the report show that
the contributions to magazines, pe-
riodicals, quarterlies and society pub-
lications included 183 articles written
by 122 professors for 158 different
publications during 1938.

Language Club Taps

Sigma Kappa Phi, honorary mod-
ern languages fraternity, tapped six
new members at a dinner held last
Wednesday in the “Y” clubrooms.

The tappees were: Katherine B.
Becker, C40, Helen Lubit, Ed40, Hel-
en E. Weissert, Ed40, Ruth McHenry,
Ed40, Mary R. Ammon, C40, and
Mrs. Mulchern. Each of the new
members prepared a selection from
their major language and gave it as

Professor Lists
Driving Forces

ITHACA, N. Y.—(ACP)—The ﬁve
driving forces in the daily life of the
average college student have been
chartered by Cornell University’s
Dr. Julian L. Woodward after an
extensive research into campus so-
cial life.

These driving forces are: “the
drive for prestige; the need to re-
lease tremendous energy by doing
things and going places; the wish to
achieve independence from home
ties and be recognized as an adult;
the problem of relationship with the
other sex, and ﬁnally the planning
for adult life.”

Dr. Woodward also determined
how students rate the prestige of
other students. He found that a male
student rates prestige by “which
fraternity he belongs to; his campus
oﬁices and: the teams he makes; his
smoothness, a compound of clothes,
car and ‘line;’ and farther down the
list his grades, more as an index of
intelligence than of culture.”

Women students rate each other
“ﬁrst by sorority, then by date rat-
ing, a compound of the ability to be
invited out frequently and the pres-
tige of the men who date them; then
by college activities, and ﬁnally by
grades as a mark of intelligence.”

Tourists Examine
Nationality Rooms

During the Christmas vacation the
Cathedral was visited by the usual
quota of out-of-town guests, accord-
ing to Univesity attendants.

Among the visitors were four Ger-
man refugees, three Armenian trav-
ellers, a University trustee, besides
the regular holiday sight—seeing
groups.

Dr. George H. Clapp, chairman of
the University board of trustees, also
was a visitor, acting a guide to his
granddaughter and her husband. Dr.
Clapp was the guest of honor at a re-
cent birthday dinner held in the
Commons Room.

By E. Seymour Kerber

Completion of the decorative paint-
ing in the Czechoslovakian Room by
Mr. and Mrs. Karel Svolinsky of
Prague marks the mid-point of the
preparations for the dedication of
four more nationality rooms in Feb-
ruary.

The Svolinskys are both artists and
graduates of the artistic and indus-
trial school in Prague. Mrs. Svol-
inska, whose ﬁrst name is Marie, is
a sculpturess. Mr. Svolinsky is an
artist and designer of stained glass
windows.

Travel Extensively

Almost every country in Europe
has been visited by the artistic cou-
ple, but this is the ﬁrst trip either of
them have made to America. Mr.
Svolinsky speaks Italian, French,
and German, besides his native Czech
and Slovak. His wife speaks all
these and English.

Greatest work of Svolinsky was
his part in the completion of the St.
Vitis cathedral in Prague. This ca-
thedral was started in the twelfth
century and never ﬁnished. Recently
the Czechoslovakians have completed
it. Besides designing mosaic stone
work for the cathedral ﬂooring, Mr.
Svolinsky constructed the mosiac
stained glass windows in the new
wing of the cathedral.

Mrs. Svolinska was very explicit in
her descriptions of the stained glass
windows. “They are not,” she said,
“like the windows in the Heinz
chapel, where the colors are painted

Amherst tbaiteirs

Escape 'E‘axation

AMHERST, Mass.—(ACP)—A de-
cision of far-reaching importance on
the question of whether or not col-
lege students working in fraternity
houses for their meals should pay
social security taxes has been an-
nounced here by the Amherst Col-
lege cooperative fraternity business
manager.

He revealed that the Massachu-
setts State Unemployment Tax com-
mission has allowed exemption from
the tax to student waiters and house
officials, janitors and chefs.

The fraternities, however, must
continue to pay the federal old age
insurance taxes, and those operating
dining rooms must pay a federal un-
employment excise tax. The Social
Security Board has received many
protests on this tax, and the board
has notiﬁed fraternities that it is con-
sidering recommending to Congress
the exemption of all student em-
ployes from these two taxes.

Exactly 125 students work on the
11 student publications at Fordham

Retail Training

Bureau Celebrates Anniversary,
Dedication of New Headquarters

“The Retail Bureau Comes of Age”¢*

was the central theme of the dinner
held last Thursday evening in the
Faculty Club dining room on the sev-
enteenth ﬂoor of the Cathedral.

The purpose of the dinner was two-
foid—the celebration of the twenty-
ﬁrst anniversary of the Research Bu-
reau for Retail Training and the ded-
ication of the Bureau’s new offices on
the ninetenth ﬂoor.

The banquet attracted several hun-
dred Pittsburgh and out-of-town de-
partment store executives as well as
alumni and present students of the
bureau.

The principal speakers were four
former directors of the Bureau, Dr.
J. B. Miner, now head of the psychol-
ogy department at the University of
Kentucky; Dr. W. W. Charters, re-
search director at Ohio State univer-
sity; Dr. James H. Greene, vice pres-
ident of the Pittsburgh Chamber of
Commerce; and Dr. David R. Craig,
president, American Retail federa-
tion.

Edgar J. Kaufmann, head of Kauf-
mann’s department stoe, formally
dedicated the Bureau’s new ofﬁces
and presented them to the University,
saying that the Bureau had “helped
brush aside many misunderstandings
among ourselves.

Chancellor John G. Bowman made
the acceptance for the University
with the statement that he was at
ﬁrst unable to see the relation of
“moving goods to education.”

The Bureau was founded at Car-
negie Institute of Technology in May,
1918, remaining there until the Bu-

reau moved to Frick Acres in 1923.
Its sponsors are the department
stores in Pittsburgh, and its purpose
is to raise the level of jobs and per-
sonnel in retail work.

Bishop Brown is the present direc-
tor of the Bureau. T\venty—ﬁ\‘e stu-
dents are admitted to the Bureau
each year from the large number of
applications received. These 25 stu-
dents undergo an intense training
which includes advertising, sales pro-
motion, personnel management, and
labor relations, among other subjects.

The Bureau’s new oflices, located
on the 19th ﬁoor, include the most

modern and scientiﬁc Classrooms,
which are equipped with-white
“blackboards.” Another feature is

the Bureau’s library, housing one of
the most complete collections of re-
tailing books in the country.

The furnishings and decoration of
the library were a gift to the Bureau
from Mr. Kaufmann, chairman of the
administrative committee of the Bu-
reau.

on the glass, but each color represents
a completely separate piece of glass
bound together by lead.”

As she has done very little work
of her own in the past, Mrs. Svolin-
ska spoke more willingly of her hus-
band’s work. “He paints in oils,
watercolors, tempera, and does in-
taglios besides his work with mosaics
and glass.”

His work has been exhibited in
eight countries besides his own, Mrs.
Svolinska said. The Grand Prix of
the Paris Exhibition Internationals
was awarded to Mr. Svolinsky in
1925 and 1934. His work was ex-
hibited in America at a Chicago ex-
hibition.

Appreciate Liberalism

America has made a decided im-
pression on the Svolinskys. The lib-
eralism of feeling among the Amer-
icans is wellappreciated by the cou-
ple, but they feel that it sometimes
results in an indeﬁneable vagueness.

“American manners are very dif-
ferent,” Mrs. Svolinska remarked.
“They cannot be judged by European
standards.”

The Cathedral was very interesting
and curious to the artists, as they

Chemistry Authority
Begins Lecture Series

Tomorrow at 11:30 o’clock, Dr. F.
W. Adams, industrial fellow at Mel-

chemistry topics. His subject will be
“Economic Changes in the Process
Industries.”

Parents Meet to Discuss

Importance of Studies

The January meeting of Parent’s
Council will be held this evening, at
8:15 o’clock in 1309 Cathedral.

The importance of studies and
grades in student success will be dis-
cussed at the meeting.

Speakers for the evening are Dr.
Charles G. King, professor of chem-
isty, Dr. Richard Hope, associate
professor of philosophy, and Mr. Ed-
win L. Peterson, assistant professor
of English.

An open discussion will be held
after the speakers have presented the
topic.

on gothic structures. They believe
that it is truly gothic in its style and
does not wander, as many other
critics have stated.

One of the truly appreciable de-
tails of the University, Mrs. Svolin-
ska stated, is the atmosphere created
by the chimes. They make it seem
really cathedral,” she said.

University students, as the Svol-
skys noted during their month-long
stay, are courteous and nice, but dif-
fer in mannerisms from the student
youth of Europe.
