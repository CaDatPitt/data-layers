$2 Per Credit Increase
To Erase Deficit, For Salary

A tuition increase of $2 a credit hour, with correspond- _
ing increases in the professional schools, was announced late
yesterday afternoon by Chancellor R. H. Fitzgerald at the '
annual meeting of the faculty. '

The increase, which has been authorized by the Board .
of Trustees, will become effective with the beginning of the
fall semester, 1954. The new tuition rate now becomes $16
a credit, with the present University fee and other fees
remaining the same. _ '

Chancellor Fitzgerald _said the announcement was made .
“reluctantly, but as a matter of strict necessity in order to
meet increasing expenses of the University and to provide
for modest merit increases in certain faculty salaries.” Over
the past_22 years there has been a ‘total increase of $6 a

Clmncellorfs Message

TO ALL THEPITT STUDENTS: _

At its last meeting the Board of Trustees voted to in-
crease the charge for- tuition from $14 a semester hour to
$16, effective with the-‘beginning of the fall semester, 1954.
A comparable increase has been authorized for the profes-
sional schools. '

1 The tuition for”the current semester and for the 1954
summer session remains the ‘same. ' _

For many months the Administration has been confront-
ed with the problems of ﬁnancing University operations in
the face of the continuing upward spiral of costs. In each of
the past two years expenses have exceeded income by
nearly $200,000. We have met this difference by drawing
upon modest reserves built up by auxiliary enterprises
during the post war. years of peak enrollment. These re-
serves are now virtually depleted. To continue the present
tuition rates means either a serious deﬁcit or a lowering,
of educational quality. Neither of these answers is accept-
able to any of us. ’ . . s

‘ The increase, amountingto about 14 percent, will ease
the University’s most pressing problems. We must provide
better salaries. for our faculty and staff, and we must oper-
ate within our income. In_addition we will accompany the
‘increase by further attention to our scholarship program
to make sure that the increase will not operate to deprive
-any worthy‘student, now enrolled, of a chance for an edu-
cation. ' A 0

.- ‘Income from tuition and student fees is providing ap-
proximately 42 «percent of our budget for the current year.
Even with the increase, students will pay less than half
the cost of operating the University. The remainder- must
continuel to come from gifts and income from gifts of
others, the state appropriation, subsidies for research, etc.

Everyone will agree, we aresure, that we must pay
additional attention to‘ faculty salaries in order to keep
good teachers, recruit new faculty strength" and to provide
additional recompense for faithful service, long hours and
expert competence if our faculty is to continue to grow in
quality and reputation.

The University now supports a system of scholarships
and student aid costing more than $500,000. This is -in
addition to scholarships from private sources made directly
to students. The Trustees have insisted that a portion of
the increased income be used to assist any worthy student
now enrolled at'the~University of Pittsburgh on whom the
increased tuition works a genuine hardship. The deans
of men and women have been asked to review and recom-
mend action in cases brought to their attention.

Where appropriate, we suggest that_ you discuss’ this
letter with your parents. We are anxious that all concerned,
students and parents, understand the necessity for this
change.

i Sincerely, '
. R. H. Fitzgerald.

Spirit Defined Best  

In Freshman Prose

The contest, to obtain the best deﬁnition for “school spirit”

was suggested last Fall by The Pitt News and heartily backed

-by Dr. H. C. Carlson. Finally, all the entries have been judged

and. two outstanding papers awarded ﬁrst place and ‘honor-
able mention. The Judges for the contest were: Dr. Donald
E. Swarts, publications director; 1

Tim Kovar, Pitt News Editor; and
Elinore Stone, Associate Editor of
the News. .

s The following entry was ad-
judged the most applicable to the
situation and the most suitable
deﬁnition for the term “school
spirit.” It was written by Harold
Jacobs, a freshman in the College
and a resident of Ambridge, Pa;.
He will be awarded the‘ Carlson

_ _ ‘award-—a $25 prize for his deﬁni-

 

tion. He may receive his award
by identifying himself to Dr.
Swarts in 828 C1.

Other entries will be printed
from time to time in the News as
space and opportunity permit.

“School spirit is the feeling of
loyalty for the institution which
gives one knowledge’. It is marked

by avowed support for programs

that these deﬁcits had been cov-

large enrollments following World
War. II. These reserves are now
substantially depleted.
Salary Raises Necessary

Faculty salaries were cited as
another reason for the tuition in-

In addition to his announcement"

before yesterday’s faculty meet-
ing, Chancellor Fitzgerald sent a
special letter to all students-—
through this special edition of the

_ Pitt News—explaining‘reason_s for

the increase and asking them to
discuss it with their parents.
Student Aid May Increase

In this letter he said that pro-
grams of scholarship and student
aid wi1l,be carefully reviewed and
that assistance will be available to
any worthy student, now" enrolled,
on whom the increased tuition
works a demonstrable hardship.
The University already - offers
scholarship aid annually amount-
ing to more than $500,000. Efforts
will be made to gain additional
support for the program of student
aid. —

Mounties Can
Give Panthers
NCAA Chance

By STEVE BUTCHOK

The Panther baseball team
travels to Morgantown, W. Va.

_ tomorro_w in an attempt to
hand the West Virginia Moun-
taineers their ﬁfth consecutive
"defeat over a three year span.

This game will probably re-
veal the ‘fate of the Mittmen’s
tournament chances, A victory
could conceivably earn them a
spot in the NCAA Tournament
for, the second successive year,
while a defeat would make their
chances very remote.

The Mittmen now sport a 6-4

"record following their win over
Clarion on Tuesday.

In the 10-5 decision over Clar-
ion, the Mittmen were aided tre-
mendously by the erratic ﬁelding
of their opponents who committed
eight miscues in the abbreviated
seven inning contest. _

With the score deadlocked at 4-
all after three frames,‘ Al Payne
entered the game for the first time
this year, replacing Don Miller on
the mound. He turned in a ﬁne re-
lief stint, allowing only one run
the remainder of the. game.

’ The Panthers sewed up the
game with six runs in the ﬁfth
inning on three errors, three bases
‘on balls, and a timely single by
sPayne. .

‘Doc Shanafelt, who will un-

doubtedly get the pitching assign-
ment against the Mounties, is cur-
rently the leader in the earned
run department with a 3.23 mark.
He has also whiffed 39 batsmen in
391/5; innings.
‘ The other part of the one-two
pitching punch, Miller, has an
ERA of-4.18 with 29 strikeouts in
28 innings.

‘Leading the hitters is catcher
Milt -Emery with’ 12 out of 34 for
a cool .353 average._Following him

Indicate Better Marks

Pitt’s track team, which lost a squeaker to Penn State
last Saturday, faces another close shave tomorrow when the
Panthers host the Notre Dame thinclads at the Stadium.

The ﬁeld events are scheduled to start at 1:30, with the
trackischedule set to begin at '2 p.m.

Several members of the Irish track squad are capable
of setting stadium records or forcing Pitt athletes to do so.

" One of Notre Dame’s top per-°

formers is Bill Squires, best miler
in Notre Dame history, whose time

for the mile‘ this season has been
4:14.7. Dan Sommer posted "the
best mile time for the Panthers this
season at 4:173. . -

Squires also does 1:55 in the 880,
which is the ..... .
specialty of the
Panthers’ Arn-
old Sowell. His.
best time for
the 880 this
s e a s o n w a s

have done 14-1 ninmhan
and 14-4 this spring, as compared
with Don Minihan’s 13-3, best for
a Pitt pole vaulter this season.

A real duel should develop be-
tween Harvey Newquist of Notre
Dame and Pitt’s Wally Monahan
in the 120 yard high hurdles. New-
quist posted a :l4.5 against Michi-
gan Normal while Monahan’s best
mark was :l4.3 in a triangular
meet against Navy and George-
town. _

Other Irish riinners who will

 

spots for the Fijis by sweeping
the 50 and l0O—yard dashes. Har-
vey’ Levine of Kappa Nu won the
220 in the other sprint event.

In the relays, the Phi Gams took
the 440-yarder while Delta Tau
Delta romped home first in the
880. ’ '

  

push the Panthers are Alec Pas-
trichella, whosemark forthe 100
yard dash is :.09.8; Jim Dailey, who
runs the two-mile in 9:-30, and Al
Shoenig, who has posted 1:57 in
the 880. _ '

Bernie Allard, probably the
most versatile man on the Notre
Dame squad, is another Irish
threat. He does 6-7 in the high
jump, covers about 22 feet in the
broad jump, tosses the javelin 175
feet and also throws the discus.

The Panthers have won one‘ of
three dual meets while Notre
Dame was won its only dual meet
of the season to date.

Heap Happy To Be Back In Civilization

Mrs. Milligan Braves Indians

A
V’

By JENNY HOFFMAN

After a series of modern-
day Indian encounters, Mrs.
Frederick E. Milligan, the
newest member of.Pitt’s Food
Service Center, is happy to be
back in civilization. Her interest
in Indian life, traditions, and prob-
lems was ﬁrst stimulated by her
honeymoon trip through the West

Toured Reservations
Then, several years ago, as a

of. the United Presbyterian Church,
in charge of Indian affairs, Mrs.
Milligan made a tour of the reser-
vations in the southwestern states.
In some of the isolated areas she
visited, the Indians had never be-
fore seen a white person.

Indian customs have changed
little in modern times. For ex-
ample, at a tribal meeting, Mrs.
Milligan observed a medicine
man hiding behind his blanket.
According to legend, this_was so

'that he would not become blind

from looking at his mother-in-
law, who was also present at the
ceremony. ‘ /

The fallacy of Indian stoicism
was exploded by another incident
which" occurred at a funeral cere-
mony in a village. The mother of
the dead girl, far from impassive,
“sat in the -dust on the ground,
weeping bitterly for her child.”

Low Living Conditions

Living conditions were appal-

lingly low among the tribes. Driv-
ing in a jeep over the arid, road-
less country, Mrs. Milligan found
the people living in primitive ho-
gans—huts without ﬂoors, win-
dows,tor furniture. In many cases
they were closer to starvation than
the European D.P.’s. Since there
are no schools on the reservations,
children go to work herding sheep
at the age of six. I
Through the board of direc-
tors, some of these conditions
were improved. For example, on
one reservation a good well was
drilled to supply the Indians
with an adequate amount of wa-
ter. However, much remains to
be done.

One of the most important pro-
grams that must be accomplished,
according t'o Mrs. Milligan, is to
provide schools for the children so
that they may have a chance to
better their way of life. “Accord-
ing to our Indian treaties,” she
said, “we promised these people a
school for every 30 children. Now,
in the Navajo tribe alone, there
are 16,000 children with no schools
available.” _ «

Schools on Wheels Needed

Because of the migratory habits
of the families as they follow their
ﬂocks of sheep, trailer schools
would prove very practical. The
problem must be met not only with
suﬁiciept funds, but with ade-
quately trained personnel who are

rugged territory.

Although she is now far‘ from
the Indians and has given up her
position on the board of directors
because of a lack of time, /Mrs.
Milligan remains -deeply interested
in their problems. '

On the ﬁrst of January, she
started her work at the Univer-

sity. Concerning Pitt, she says,
“Until you work in the Univer-
sity, you cannot really appreci-
ate it.” She terms the small,
busy oﬁice in the Food Service
Center “Grand Central Station;”

Mrs. Milligan. is originally from

Pittsburgh.‘ She graduated from

Westminster College, working her
way through as a librarian, and
obtained the masters degree from
the Biblical Seminary connected
with New York University, where
she also worked both as a librarian
and a cooking teacher. At the
present time she is living in East
End. Her husband, the late Mr.
Frederick Milligan, was known to
Pittsburghers as an attorney with

McCloy. Her son attends Grove
City College, and two daughters
go to Peabody High School.

Revival a

Success

_ By‘ IRV ROTHMAN
“Yes M’ Lord,” current Pitt Players production, is an-

other outstanding presentation. From the very moment the
curtain rises on Lloyd Welden’s inviting and comfortable
living room set‘ until Beecham clears away the last sherry,
the audience is treated to subtle English humor, witty dia-
logue, a“ fast moving plot, and precise characterizations.

Director Harvey Pope’s decision’

to bring back “Yes M’ Lord” after
a successful run last summer, pro-
vides a ﬁtting climax to such
shows as “The Male Animal” and
the charming, but powerful, “The
Grass Harp” of this season.
Fortunately, Jack Ingrim and
Jo Bosco star again in the roles
of.Lord and Lady Lister, which

- they portrayed during the summer

season.

An a b s e n t - minded county
leader, Lord Lister is the Eng-
lishman who has, submitted to
the rapidly failing aristocracy,
and who takes pride in the fact
that he is non—partisan in pol-
itics. In fact, rabbits and foxes
provide more interest than his
own son’s loss of a. parliament
position, held in the family for
300 years. I I
Lady Lister, Jo Bosco, provides
a match ‘for her husband in acting
ability. The rich British accent
carries kindly tones.

The dying embers of an auto-
cratic family are proudly borne
by Beecham, the butler‘ (“Why
he’s England himself . . .”), who
takes Tony’s defeat‘ as a personal
affront. Emil Herman portrays the
stereotype butler with extreme
astuteness.

Bob Watford, however, as Tony
(Lord Pym) needs to do some
work to develop a British dialect.
In a play enriched by the pleasant
English accents, the “lordship”
carries no trace of one and a few
“jolly eh’s” are ineffective with an
American accent. His reaction to
Beecham’s candidacy,.in a major
scene, is too restrained. The audi-
ence must .force_"i_tself to, believe

 

that he was shocked.

But his American sweetheart,
June Farrell, is what we’d want
from A an American girl. aggres-
sive, forceful, charming, like-
able, and temperamental. Eu-
genie Reidmiller, however, could
put more emotion or excitement
in her ﬁnal scene. ,

It is doubtful that any Cockney
maid in the British Isles could
sound as realistic as Dorothy Tear,
Bessie, who didn’t know where her
social standing could be until she
almost copied‘ Bobo Rockefeller’s
success story.

Paul Mooney’s Mr. Cleghorn
should have some Oxford accent,
but that is his only shortcoming.
Hypocritical, windy, yet powerful
as parliament politicians can be,
Mooney played to good advantage
a deep voice and tall frame.

And Fonda .Goldma.n’s Lady
Caroline did justice to the aris-
tocratic sister who also is in-
terested in politics.

“Yes M’ Lord,” by William
Douglas Home, is the story of one
family affected, by the Labor Party
victory over Churchill’s conserva-
tives‘ in 1945.
