Afghan officer visits
city, talks to media

By,‘ Mark R. Brown
Staff /Writer

The commanding officer of the
National Islamic Front of Af-
ghanistan met with local Com-
mittee for a Free Afghanistan
supporters and the media in Pitts-
burgh yesterday.

Brigadier General Rahmatullah
Safi, 57, was in Shadyside Hospi-
tal for his annual health checkup.
Safi is from Taghab, near Kabul
in Afghanistan. He commands
one of the larger of the Afghan re-
bel groups that have been fight-
ing the Soviets for over eight
years. ' '

”We are consistently beating
the Soviets on the ground, which
is why they must resort to terrorist
tactics like last week's assassina-
tion attempt on Gubuldin Hek—
maytar of the Hizbe Party,” said
Safi. Hekmaytar is the chief po-
litical officer of the fundamen-
talist party, ‘Hizbe.

, ”There can be no settlement of
the problems in Afghanistan un-
til the last Russian soldier goes
home. If a majority of our popu-
lation of 17 million voted for
communism, then we would
havenothing to fight for. But that
is not the case. We fight to ex-
press the will of Afghan people
against atheistic Soviet occu-
pation.” I

Safi said it is important that
Americans understand that the
Soviets are ”conducting genocide
on Afghan people.”

”Undefended civilians are 3

bombed and gassed. Our chil-
dren have been targeted for
specific aggression. What has the
United Nations done to help us?
Nothing. Like a council of
churches, they pray. Pray all they
want, the Russians still occupy

"my homeland,” said Safi.

Safi said they will continue to
fight until the world convinces
Moscow that they must cease.
their agression.

By Neata. Nicholas

' Staff Writer

The Career Counseling Center
at the University of Pittsburgh will
be conducting the 16th annual
Career Seminar Series. The series
will begin Monday, Sept. 28,

I I987, and continue daily, from I

p.m. until 4 p.m., through Oct. 2,
I987.

Also, on Thursday evening, a
special session will be held from
4 to 6 p.m. to accomodate work-
ing students and students in the
College of General Studies. The
seminar is open to the public,

Although this is not a recruiting

to help people who are undecid-
ed about a college major, those
who are in the process of de-
veloping their careers, those who
are considering career changes
and anyone interested in shar-
pening their job-hunting skills.

During the seminar, individu-
als are given the opportunity to

careers they -are pursuing or

 

wou|d_Iike to pursue.

Over 250 representatives from
various companies, corporations,
businesses, law offices and hospi-
tals will be available to answer
questions concerning the advan-
tages and disadvantages of cer-
tain careers. \ '

These representatives will also
be prepared to make recommen-
dations concerning the type of
education and experience need-
ed to be successful in certain job
situations. They, should also be
able to make some comment as
to the job outlook situation.

Duringthe course of the semi-
nar, a different group of career
areas will be focused upon each
day. I
On Monday, Sept_. 28, the
theme will be ”Business, Indus-
try and Communications.” Some
of the fields represented will in-
clude accounting, advertising,
computer science, engineering,
human resources, investment
banking and public relations. A
few companies such ‘as WTAE,
KDKA and B94 will also be

‘present.

WASHINGTON — Vice Presi-
dent George Bush cast the decid-
ing vote late Tuesday night as the
Senate, by 51-50, rejected a deep
reduction in President Reagan's
proposed ”star wars" budget.

With the Senate split at 50-50,
Bush cast the tie—breaking vote on
a motion to table, and thus kill,
a proposal to spend $3.7 billion
for ”star wars” in the fiscal year
starting Oct. 1.

Bush voted to tip the balance
in favor of the 37 Republicans
and 13 Democrats who had lined
up against 41 Democrats and
nine Republicans on the ”star
wars” spending issue.

The vote came as the
Democratic-controlled chamber
plowed through a huge bill
authorizing the Pentagon budget
for the fiscal year opening Oct. 1.

The current ”star wars” budg-
et is $355 billion, but Reagan
sought to increase it to $5.7 bil-

\ lion for the 12 months starting
Oct. 1. The Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee voted for $4.5
billion and Tuesday's vote was
on a proposal by Sen. Bennett

Johnston, D-La., to reduce that
$4.5 billion figure even lower.

The Democratic-controlled
House, in its version ofa defense
bill passed. last May, approved
$3.1 billion for the Strategic
Defense Initiative, as ”star wars”
is formally known.

Elderly to suffer from
slower lottery sales

HARRISBURG — Lottery tick-
et sales in Pennsylvania are grow-
ing at the slowest, rate in more
than a decade, prompting a legis-
lative watchdog committee to
warn Wednesday that cuts may
be made in senior citizen
programs.

”This is a danger signal that
must be heeded,” said Gregg
Martino, a staffer for the Legisla-
tive Budget and Finance Com-
mittee.

Martino said the 1.4 percent in-
crease in sales over the last year
is the slowest growth rate since
the 1974-75 fiscal year.

In 1912, George M.P. Baird
wrote the lyrics to a song that he
hoped would lastlas long as the
University of Pittsburgh.

Now, 75 years after those
words were written (the words to
Pitt's alma mater) it seems as
though Baird's dream is dying.
Can we, in good conscience, ac-
tually let our school song just dis-
appear into the dusty pages of the
old Owls? I -

In comparison, should we let
the Constitution of the United
States fall back into the archives
of the Smithsonian just because
it's old? It's the same concept.

George Baird, the author of the
alma mater, was a 1909 graduate
of the University of Pittsburgh
(then, the Western University of
Pennsylvania). He lived in Pitts-
burgh almost all of his life (except
when he fought in WWII) and
made several noteworthy contri-
butionsto Pitt and the communi-

that picked the golden panther as
Pitt's mascot.

He formed and directed the Pitt
Players until 1918. After he
graduated from Pitt, he came

Racism: Can anything be done to combat it?

Editor's Note: This is the first
in a series of articles that will ap-
pear every Thursday for five
weeks dealing with racism na-

 tionally, /ocallyand in particular
1 at the University of Pittsburgh.

This first article will serve as an

S introduction, to the situation at

H large.

..
f

The rally against racial violence
Sept. 19 in Pittsburgh has left a
lot of people thinking. Reassess-
ing their values. Taking stances.
Practicing apathy (if that's not a
contradiction in terms).

Most importantly, it has
brought a stirring situation to
light. The rally was a confirma-

tion that a resurgence of racism -

is happening. Like it or not, ra-
cism exists and probably always
will. There is no effective way
known to combat racism. We can
change laws, but we cannot
change people.

Or can we?

Yesterday's Pittsburgh Press let-
ters to the editor headline was
”Racially, all is not well in
Pittsburgh.”

Many people are inclined to
agree. This certainly does not

9am -

reflect well upon a former No. 1?
city. In fact, it is a cause for
shame.

Then again, some will say ra-
cism is not experiencing a resur-
gence; it always existed with its
present intensity; it is just captur-
ing more media attention. But be-
cause the media often plays a
major role in defining what we
act upon, we must accept it as
truth. ,

The cliches are endless, the ar-
gument often times moot, but the
message being transmitted and
the message that is conveyed are
two entirely different ideologies
— which form the basis for many
conflicts.

Are we above racism, are we
above considering it as an entity?
Perhaps that attitude can be ac-
credited with keeping the

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September 24, W87

It appears that vocalizing one’s
opinions is also becoming a more
accepted practice, as we are
ushering out a phase of ”yuppie—
dom” and entering into a new era
which has yet tobe understood
clearly by me.

in order to form any kind of
feasible resolution, those who are
opposed to racism must confront
the issue head-on.

Many organizations have been
formed to combat the oppression
that is suffered by those who are
victims of racism.

Disgruntled blacks have unit-
ed, but what many carelessly fail
to realize is that their claims are
all too legitimate. They should
not be dismissed so readily by
people who do notwant to ”get
involved.”

At this point, racism needs to
be defined for the purposes of this
article. While other forms of ra-

 

cial prejudice undeniably exist, it
has clearly become a battle be-
tween blacks and whites.

At the University of Pittsburgh,
racism is a continuing issue. The
university committed itself to a
symbolic gesture by divesting
from South Africa, but what is it
doing to assist the ceasing of ra-
cism at the University of Pitts-
burgh? Can it do anything? Is it
even responsible at all?

No one can deny that there is
tension. Or can they?

There are so many unanswered
questions, but one thing remains
true. Racial equality is inherent;
racial perception external. It is
only through paralleling the two
that we can achieve true equali-
ty for all.

Next week's article will feature
an interview with Black Action
Society Chairperson Monique
Sims.

Mater  

Continued from page 3

itself on the map, a piece was
written with something for

everyone. .

‘lust _like the Constitution, this is

' a ”living” alma mater. The fourth
S —  line of the ﬁrst "stanza says that Pitt
if 7 is "Dowered with eternal youth.”
The alma mater suggests that all _

people are welcomeito educate
themselves here“ ;regardless“ of

’ age, religion, racejororigin: ”Thy
I mother-love embraces All who

gather at Thy knee, caste and
classes, creeds and races.”

The almamater also represents
a ”living” document in the way
it has survived the changes neces-
sary for ongoing traditions. Ac-
cording to records found in
Hillm'an’s archives, George Baird
had to write at least four sets of
words before the authorities at
Pitt would accept one. Then there
was the music — what was ap-
propriate? -

In the end, the Austrian Nation-
al Anthem was the selection. It
was written by Franz Joseph
Haydn.

However, before Pitt settled on
that version, Dr. Norris L.
Stephens, the music librarian at
Pitt, acknowledged the fact that
Charles W. Scovel and Will
Earhart had a/try at it, too.

And then there was another ar-
rangement that is on the album.
”Proud Traditions — A Musical
Tribute to Pitt” by John ,P._ Yankee
for Pitt's ‘Bicentennial 'celebra'ti‘on«.
Yankee’s arrangement is based
on Haydn’s music. That is also
the music . the Pitt Band uses
when playing’ the alma mater.

Now that you've read how

‘much time and hard work went

into this little piece of history,

don't you think it's at least w'o.rth ' P‘ A

a look?

Think of how George Bairdand
past students feel about the alma

mater. The alma mater’isn’t hard

to find. Look in a football pro-
gram. Look in an-Owlyearbook
(the 1916 edition,‘ page 467 has
it, for example); You don't neces-
sarily even need to know-it. just
be able to recognize it — the
words, the music. ‘

Someday when you graduate

from Pitt and look back fondly on

your. college ..years, you can». .  —

remember the alma mater. s

THE PITT NEWS

Attractions are nothing new

By Ike Shibley

Staff Writer

Ifthere is a lesson to be learned
from Adrian Lyne’s newest movie
Fatal Attraction, it is that one
should never have an affair with
a stranger.

In addition to the dangers in-
herent in one night stands in the
form of STDs, there is also the
possibility that the unknown per-
son may be psychotic. This is the
situation in Lyne’s film.

Michael Douglas, who from all

indications in the film has been.

a faithful and loving husband to
his wife (Anne Archer), sudden-
ly, unexplainably falls for a
professional from a publishing
company (Glenn Close).
Together they have two steamy
scenes which are reminiscent of
Lyne’s last effort,,97/2 Weeks. In
9V2 Weeks, Mickey Rourke and
Kim Basinger embarked on an

erotic, sensual, sometimes beau-

tiful journey. Their passion_was
the focus of the film.
In Fatal Attraction another rela-

‘ tionship is followed, but in this

one the results are vastly differ-
ent. Instead of a relationship that
extends for the better part of three
months Close and Douglas have
two promiscuous encounters. Af-
terwards, only suspense and ter-
ror are present as Close harasses
and hounds Douglas while he at-
tempts to keep the affair a secret
from his wife. ,

The movie resembles, too
closely at times, Clint Eastwood's
directorial "debut Play Misty for

dB’s take

By Dave Zafris
Staff Writer

After three years of spinning his
wheels, Peter Holsapple jumped
into his faded '63 Rambler Ameri-
can 440 TD with-dual stick shifts
and hit the road.

The dB’s frontman was tired of
sour record deals and ineffective
distribution. He committed to _a
solo tour last summer, and drove
from Baltimore to Los Angeles,
playing club dates along the way.

”|t’s a good test of one’s abili-
ty to play solo,” he said. ”You
have to really rise to the oc-
casion.

”When you've got a band, you
have’ others to blame things on,”
he continued. ”When you’reout
there by yourself it's like ’look at
me.’ ”

Holsapple decided to docu-
ment his one-man tour of the
United States. He brought along
a video camera and interviewed
other bands and clubs across the
nation.

Holsapple said he's still editing
the footage, and MTV has offered
to air a portion of the video tour
on The Cutting Edge Happy
Hour.

But Holsapple's not ready to
commit to going solo. He's still
one of the dB’s. "We all thought
about going solo at one time or
another. I might do a solo record
of acoustic stuff, but right now
we're getting ready to tour.”

The dB’s cross-country tour,
their first since 1984, passes
through The Decade tonight. The

Me. The similarities are exten-
sive. In that movie, Eastwood por-
trays a radio disc jockey who has
a devoted fan who calls him ev-
ery night requesting him to play
”Misty.” When the avid fan
meets Eastwood, she immediate-
ly falls for him. When, after an in-
itial encounter, he is less than
receptive to her advances she ter-
rorizes him in the same way
Close hounds Douglas.

Close slits her wrists“ as Doug-
las is about to leave her, maybe
forever. This exact sequence was
present in Eastwood's film 15
years earlier. .

Close calls Douglas at his office
and at home trying to convince
him to see her. So does East-
wood’s antagonizer.

Despite all the parallels,
though, Play Misty For Me was
an infinitely better film. There are
many intangible reasons why it
was the superior effort, but there
are also a few obvious ones.

The woman in Play Misty For
Me was an unknown actress. She
was genuinely horrifying because
the audience could not envision
her as being anything but a
crazed lunatic. Glenn Close has
had so much exposure in films
like The Big Chill and The lagged
Edge that the viewer has trouble
seeing her as this insanely at-
tached woman.

The'mood in Eastwood's film
was somber. It was scaringly

— realistic. In Lyne’s work the sub-

ject matter is exploited so much
that thefinale is no better than a
Friday the 73th film.

the road

band is promoting their first LP in
three years, The Sound of Music
,—— their first American recording
contract.

”We_ had to get ourselves out
of a very complicated deal, and
it took us a while to negotiate the
deal with IRS [record co.]. That's
why we haven't been aroundfor
three years,” Holsapple said.

The dB’s first two LPs, Stands
For Decibels and Repercussion
were recorded on‘the British Al-
bion label and were widely im-
ported. But since '84, the band
has, as Holsapple puts it, ”been
in a rut.” '

Bearsville released the dB’s
third LP, Like This, and then fold-
ed a few weeks later. But the
band seems to have broken out
of their glut of bad luck with a
diverse LP of ‘original Holsapple
material.

Benmont Tench (keyboardist
for Tom Petty), Syd Straw (Gold-
en Palominos), and Van Dyke
Parks helped out on the album.

"I've known Benmont since I
was 14-years-old,” he said/‘We
went to prep school together. He
was only able to come in for one
day and record, but it worked out
pretty well.”

Other IRS Stuff — The Cutting

Edge Happy Hour airs tonight
and Sunday at 10 p.m. on MTV.
This month's installment features
live performances from -Red
Kross, Clara Ward Singers and
segments with Julian Cope,
Siouxsie & the Banshees, Whodi-

ni, Timbuk 3 and Camper Van

Beethoven.

Lyne’s direction is too straight-
forward. There is shot after shot
of hallways, stairwells, doorways
and windows, all designed to im-
press upon the viewer that Doug-
las’ character feels claustrophobic
because of the corner Close’s
character is backing him into.
The shots become so repetitive
that one tires of the ploy, and

wishes that more creativity could

have been used.

On a more personal level, I
was disillusioned by the use of
excessive nudity in the film. The
gratuitous sex scenes in Fatal At-
traction are‘ disconcerting.
Michael Douglas graphically
caresses Close’s nipples. At one
point, Close lies bare chested in
bed when she could have easily
pulled the sheet over herself.
Lyne is excessively and un-
necesarily expoitative.

_ Lyne’s style is unchanging. His
view of New York City is rainy
and depressing. He utilizes
precipitation to set a mood; but
he overuses it, causing the at-
mosphere to be lost entirely.

This is a shoddy, sloppy piece
of filmmaking that has little to
offer, certainly nothing original.
The premise of the movie is in-
triguing but has been handled
much more adroitly already. Fa-
tal Attraction has no attraction.

1 JEFF SE\lIIAI.D
BETWEEN THE LINES

When I was just out of college,
starving and holding fast to my
dream of becoming a profession-
al writer, I worked late-night shifts
at an establishment that rented,
among other things, a wide vari-
ety of movies on Videocassettes.

As a clerk, my primary respon-
sibility was to assist customers. As
a lover of films, I took it upon my-
self to brush off the regular con-
tingent of weirdos who clamored
for the keys to the X—rated cases,
and turned my attention toward
those in search of more profound
cinematic experiences.

I'd jockey patrons away from
Porky’s and into the direction of
Fanny and Alexander,Divaor Ran
—— foreign films which are, in my
opinion, substantial. When it
came to domestic releases, I'd
push Midnight Cowboy,/A Street-
car Named Desireor East of Eden
—— favorites of mine and solid
representatives of what Holly-
wood can be.

- Ironically, though the store car-
ried only a few copies of each,
these films almost always re-
mained available. But to lay your
hands on one of the dozen or so
copies of Police Academy or Fri-
day the 13th was another story.
Copies of these slasher films and

lowbrow, comic romps blew out
of the store in volume. As far as
I was concerned, the fi_lm—Ioving
public had failed.the taste test.
Admittedly, from a business
perspective,‘ if I'd been working

on commission, I'd have proba-
bly entered the den of stupidity‘

myself with a big smile anda big-
ger cash register. For this, I used
to think that we, the public, were
solely to blame. Hollywood gives

us what we ask for, right? To a.

degree, this is true, though I think
it's time to spread the blame a bit.

Recently, David Puttnam, the
controversial president of Colum-
bia Pictures, was asked to resign
his position after only one year.
I was not surprised. Puttnam’s
hard-nosed style had led to tem-
pestuous relationships with key
film industry talent which, in
turn, led to his unemployment. It
all happenned a little quicker
than I expected, that's all.

One tenet of corporate sur-
vival: Never underestimate the
power of fraternity. More specif-
ically, in the film industry, never
devil the big boys unless you're
prepared to be run out of town,
film cans in hand.

Prior to assuming the top spot
at Columbia, Puttnam was under
contract with Warner Brothers.
There, his films included Chari-
ots of Fire, The Killing Fields and
The Mission. I doubt that anyone
who's seen these films would
question Puttnam’s status as a
force to be reckoned with in con-
temporary film. How many top
film company executives could
boast such credits? How many
are actually filmmakers them-
selves?

But while Puttnam is respected
as a fine producer, none of his
films have been commercial
blockbusters. And in the year as
chief at Columbia, Puttnam had
run face-first into the iron_wil| of

big business ‘and itsgoverning
philosophy — put your money
where the bigger money is. Hel-
lo, Eddie Murphy. Goodbye, art
and, in time, David Puttna_m.

' .In the end, Puttnam most like-
ly will be bought out of the re-
maining two years of a reported
three—year, $10 million deal. A lit-
tle ego bruising, but he can take
it. The Hollywood fraternity will
smile and get back to business.
And we'll get more cinematic
masterpieces like Ishtar. Who's
the big loser? Filmgoers.

As an artist at the top of the
Columbia hierarchy, Puttnam
was at a distinct disadvantage. If
that seems strange to you, con-
sider this. Columbia Pictures is
owned by the Coca-Cola Co.

Coke employs the ubiquitous Bill
Cosby as a major spokesperson.
Cosby also happens to be a share-
holder in a Coke bottling compa-
ny in Philadelphia.

According to The Wall Street

‘journal, Cosby was miffed at the-

behavior of a production execu-
tive Puttnam assigned to his
Columbia film, Leonard: Part IV,
and, for one reason or another,
decided to sign a new movie
production contract with ,_Warn—
er Brothers. The top cats got an-.
gry. The fix was in. And Puttnam
was out. This time, Hollywood
had failed the taste test.

In America, men and women
are free to pursue happiness.
They may live where they
choose, work when they want

and go where they please. Of"

course, they must obey the
boundaries of the law and be as
young as possible.

Charles Darwin said that the
survival of a species depends on
the adaptation of its members.
Those who can't adapt die. It's a
logical theory, and the human
race is no exception to it.

Our society is constantly
changing. Ideas are always being
created, debated and revised.

Most of us will live for 75
years. If we subtract our‘child-

hood and retirement, we have
about 50 years to work and ac-
tively participate in the formation
of society's thinking. It is this
thinking that is recorded by the
history books. .

But what happens when your
50~years are up? You've outlived
your time in society, your think-
ing is outdated, and you've be-
come just another senior citizen.

Our society is a structured
competition. Whether the arena
is science, politics, athletics or a
beauty pageant, everyone strives
to be better than the next guy.
We admire the participants, re-
ward the winners and disregard
those who can't play. It's like a
footballgame. Once a player is
injured and sidelined, the fans
soon forget his name.‘

In society, age is the worst in-
jury. Cosmetic businesses and
plastic surgeons make millions
each day on people's fear of their
birthdays. However, it's not long
before aging bones, wrinkles, and
a weak heart show through all the
make—up. ‘

Luckily, society has created op-
tions for the elderly. Senior-
citizens can move to a variety of
‘old houses where they'll be taken
care of. They'll play cards, watch
TV, eat, play checkers, go to the

MATTHEW
THORNTON

I was on an elevator in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union the other day and
heard something very distressing.
A student was discussing a class
he had taken last term, and by the
way he talked about it, he hadn't
done so well.

It's not that I'm distressed. by
the thought of someone not do-
ing so well in a class. Heaven
knows, I've been guilty of that too
many times myself. The thing by
which I was disquieted, though,

was the tone he used to describe _

the experience.

He sounded almost resentful
that he was required to take the
class. He sounded put out by the
thought that he might be required
to know something that did’ not
directly apply to his career in-
terests.

That's_funny,' I thought we were
all here at college to find out a lit-

» tle bit more about the world, and

the ideas that have flowered be-.

 

way' things should _be. The ﬂrole’

fore us. , .

I have heard the same senti-
ment expressed in classes of
which I have been a part. Stu-
dents act, certainly the best word
for it, as if they are doing some-
one a favor by even being
present. I get the feeling some-
times that the ideal of the student
interested in the pursuit of

knoweledge for its own sake has A

been lost somewhere in the
deafening shuffle of resume
papers.

Too often, students A are dis-
traught with the notion of having
to take classes in which they have
‘decided they have no interest. It
seems thatsomewhere along the
way, minds that are to be opened
and enriched by the college ex-
perience are closing before even
reaching class.

A number of books, of which
The Closing of. the -American
Mind is the most famous, have
pointed out that the college edu-
cation is becoming more a stop-
over to a career than a jumping-
off point.

Some blame the increasing
debts many students incur to
finance their educations for the
continually more pragmatic atti-
tudes many assume. Some blame
the public school systems for fail-
ing to foster interest in education.
Some blame television for provid-
ing a skewed sense of what might
be important.

It seems that television is the

most‘ possible choice here. _On

bathroom and sleep. What more
can they possibly want?

Despite these accomodations
some of the elderly choose to
take care of themselves. These
brave men and women are the
easy victims of society. They are
the naive existing in an MTV age
. They are a minority which is
laughed at and ignored.

Youth is practically worshiped
in our country. Consider the ap-
peal of sports. America's sports

coverage is one of the biggest in T

the world. We are fascinated with
the potential of the human body.
The abilities of athletes effective-
ly reflect the strength of youth.
The people obssesed with aer-
obics and jogging gain more than
a healthy body. They get the high
of knowing what it's like to be
able to do it. Like an addiction,
exercise-freaks physically abuse
themselves for the simple pleas-
ure of feeling they're heart work.
Youth seems to be more ap-
pealing to us. «When somebody is
young, their ideas are fresh, their
mind is sharp‘, and their body is
toned. I '
Why do we turn away from the
elderly? Probably because we
don't really understand them.
My grandparents are two of the

most stubborn, narrow-minded

a new success 

models today are not found in
books, but in neatly packaged,
well advertised shows.

The characters on TV, as well

xas the lifestyles sold in the com-

mercials, are those of the upward-
ly mobile class. In the shows, the
bad guys are the folks who ha-
ven't gotten their act together
well enough to get an M.B.A. We

.see that the end is the important

thing, that success, monetary
usually, is the only thing worth
having. ’

Somewhere, the value of an in-
teresting and stimulating journey
through school has been replaced
by a new set of priorities. "Get a
new car, say something about
yourself with your watch, take
fashion risks, have a Michelob,"
are the slogans of this new
mindset.

How could Milton, Tolstoy,
Douglass ' or Newton hope to
compete? .

To my mind, the scope of pos-
sibilities offered on TV, the only
access to the rest of the world
most take advantage of, has been
become more limited lately. The

television networks and the cable

channels have become victims of
their own advertising, pursuing
only increased revenues.

Profit serves as both motivation
and goal in this new society.

. With their eyes constantly on the

bottom line, many people fail to
notice the rich store of ideas
available. _
The widespread pursuit of
profit pro__duces competition.

citizens, the elderly must,con- . I

Marc Duchin is the Assistant
News Editor for The Pitt News V‘

Conflict produces anger and
anger produces very, very little.

‘I ‘I certainly do not mean to say

that interest in bettering one’s sit-V
uation is necessarily evil, quite

the contrary. I advocatea system '
within which a person can be re-~

"warded for their efforts. I do feel
though, that the costs, both in
time and anxiety, should be care-
fully weighed in decisions about
which version of success to‘
pursue. -

I see this dogged commitment
to the symbols of the better life

to be at the root of a number of -

problems. A huge demand is

created for things, all kinds of'~

things, usually disposable things.
Disposable news, disposable
cars, disposable housing, even
disposable role models."

An enormous effort goes into
providing for these desires, and
within in the dust of that scram-

bling, the ideas able to help us ‘

deal with the problems surround-
ing us disappear.

The current trends seem to in-
dicate a new philosophy of how

to make the world a betterplace. '

Success is measured by how far
from the rest of the world a per-

son can place himself. It seems to '

be a function of the thickness of
padding insulating us from our‘
environment.

But, as we all learned very ear— V

Iy, covering our ears does very lit-
tle to remove the source of a
painful noise.

Hey, fellers. Lookin’ for a re-
bound in the backyard?

Pitt is. ’

Those boys ’er hopin’ for one
real bad. And jus' think. it's only
right down there in the Wild and
the Wonderful. I

”As I've said before and will.

continue to say, one win does not
make a season,” said Panther
head coach Mike Gottfried, ”and
neither doesgone loss break one.

”But I'll say one thing,” he con-
tinued, ”we need this win just to
keep up a consistency in the
team. A loss hurts, it always does.
But we've. got to be alert and
keep our mind on this game so
we'll be back up where we want
to be.” .

After suffering a 24-21 loss la
week to Temple, the Panthers
now stand at 2-1. ,

The West Virginia Moun-
taineers, however, have a 1-2

record after beating Ohio Univer- A

sity 23-3 and losing to both Ohio
State, 24-3, and Maryland,*"25-20.
Like Gottfried, Mountaineer
coach Don, Nehlen also wants
this win for his own team's sta-
bility. A
”l think we've been playing
good football,” said Nehlan.
”The only thing is it seems we
have a tendency to self destruct.

‘We've got to stop doing that be-

fore we get so _down in the hole
that we can't get back up again,”
_ A lot of people scoffed last
week before the Temple game,
when Gottfried said he felt the
Owls’ pressures could prove
detrimental to the Panthers. This
week, he's saying the same thing
about the Mountaineers.

Some people, at
listening.

”You can never take any team
too light|y,” he said. ”You’ve al-
ways got to go into every game
and only think about that game,
Not about the crowds, not about

the stadiums, but the game and"

only the game. ,
”West Virginia is a tough and
talented ball club,” he continued,

”they've got a lot of depth. As for 
their losses, they playedthose’

people very evenly and could
have won if it weren't for some
bad executions.”

Gottfried’s quarterbacks are
again in focus "this week. Last

Nehlan has similar quarterback
woes. His starting passer is Major
Harris, a freshman. But Pitt defen-
sive coordinator John Fox does
not see this as a major problem.

”He’s young  but an excel-
lent athlete and a real threat ev-
ery time he gets his hands on the
ball,” said Fox.

One of the main points of fo- .

cus this week is that the Moun-
taineers have two players who
were originally members of the
Pitt offensive backfield — A.B.
Brown and Eugene Napoleon.
Brown leads the team in rush-
ing with 293 yards and accumu-
lated 168 in last week's game
against Maryland. His last game
played for the Panthers was

..1985’s 10-10 tie with the Moun-

taineers in'Morgantown.
”I don't really know how either

ofthem play,” said Gottfried.

Gottfried seemed quite upset
about a_cal| made in last week's
Temple game and asked that the
officiating be a little more
scrutinous this week.

The play in question came dur-
ing the second quarter of the
game when a personal foul was
called on Billy Osborn for ”either
a late hit or falling on the pile.”

”That was the worst call I've
ever seen in 25 years of coach-
ing,” said Gottfried. "He went
over and was helping Reggie
[Williams] up and down went the
flags. It was preposterous."

Whatever the game plan will
be, Gottfried said he is ready for

’ the Mountaineers.

We're going to go down there

and play the best we can. That's i

all we can do, and that's all that
can be expected of us.”

Lions just might not soar withthe Eagles

By Vince Longo
Staff Writer

Last week's record of 4-5 was
a less-than—stellar percentage of
44 percent. The low point was
the_picking of Penn State to lose
to Cincinnati. I should have
known that JoePa would be all
over the Lions after their first
regular season loss in over two
years. But you gotta pick upsets,
right? I mean, anybody can sit
here and go with all the favorites.

I can at least pat myself on the

' back based on the fact that, of my

four correct predictions, two
were upsets and one resulted in
an exact score.fTexas A&M over
tenth ranked Washington was a
mild upset and .Florida over
Alabama in Birmingham a major
one. And ‘Clemson beat Georgia
2T-20, just like I said they would.
And now, pen in hand, I set out
in search of what we all hope the
Panthers avoid this Saturday: the
.500 mark. \
Pitt-26 West Virginia-13 '

_ rated Auburn.

This is the game the ’Eers and
their fans always have circled on
the schedule, while Pitt looks to
Penn State. Nevertheless, West
Virginia will dutifully lose to the
hated Panthers.

Carter plans to  

move ahead

without regrets L

By Sam Tallarico
‘Assistant Sports Editor , .

With the tremendous shock last
week's loss to Temple left on the
Panthers, one would wonder
how that may affect Pitt_’s psyche
going into Saturday's game at
West Virginia. _ '

But according to Pitt defensive
end Jon Carter, the best thing the
Panthers can do is forget about
the Temple game and move
onward. ~

”That game against Temple,
we've got to put it behind us,”
said Carter, one of the Panthers’
team captains. ”We’ve got to put
our concentration on WVU.-We
are confident we can pick up

ple game.”

Before the Temple game, Pitt
had come off impressive wins
against Brigham Young (27-17)
and North Carolina State (34-0).
Carter, a 6-foot—5, 255-pound
senior, has been oneof the rea-'
sons for the Panthers’ success.

In the Panthers’ first three
games, Carter has been a
dominant force, totaling T T tack-
les, four of those being for loss-
es, four hurries, three sacks and
one blocked kick.

Last season, Carter set personal
highs in games played (T T),tack—
les (42) and sacks (6). At his cur-

rent pace, he has a chance to‘

exceed those figures.

Feltingoff proves valuable at No.1 seed  

By Beth Froelich

Staff Writer

Sophomore Tracy Feltingoff is
comfortable and confident play-
ing in the challenging No. 1 sin-
gles spot for the Pitt women's
tennis team. _

Feltingoff did not always dis-
play that kind of confidence on
the courts, however.

Before Feltingoff became ”seri—
ous” about tennis in her sopho-
more year of high school, she
claims she didn't care much for
the game at all,

”At first, I wasn't really too ex-
cited about the game,” said Fel-
tingoff. ”I think I was too young
to dedicate myself to it.

”My freshman year at Emmaus
High School, I was last on the
team,” continued _Feltingoff. ”I
had a bad coach who was really

_ unfair to me. I wanted to show

him that I could play better than
he thought I could. So that sum-
mer I went to camp, took lessons
and played in a lot of tour-
naments.”

Feltingoff’s efforts to improve
her game were successful, as she

She’ll

In

returned to school in the fall as
a sophomore and second on the
tennis team.

Pitt was not one of the schools
that Feltingoff, a native of Allen-

town, Pa., was considering to at- ’

tend. When" Pitt's head tennis
coach George Dieffenbach called
and invited her to a recruitment
weekend at Pitt, she decided she
had nothing to lose by checking
things out.

”I wasn't considering Pitt, but
when I came up for the recruit-
ment weekend, I had a really
good time and fell in love with
the school,” said Feltingoff.

”I feel very comfortable in Pitt's
tennis program," continued Fel-
tingoff. ”I was considering attend-
ing a few schools with very strong
tennis backgrounds. I'm glad I
didn't because it would have
been a constant struggle for me
to keep up.”

Feltingoff’s record now stands
at 2-3 playing No. 1 singles for
the Lady Panthers. Last year she
ended the season at 8-7 playing
No. 2. Coach Dieffenbach feels
Feltingoff’s performance has im-
proved greatly over last year's,

but still feels that there is room for,

improvement. ’

”Fe|tingoff has excellent
ground strokes and a solid fore-
hand and backhand,” said
Dieffenbach._”She still needs to
improve her volley and serve. If
she can do that she will become
a real contender against the Di-
vision I schools we play. .

”Feltingoff has added a lot of
team leadership this year as a
sophomore,” continued Dieffen-
bach. ”She is a good role model.
She is competitive, plays hard, is
even tempered on the court and
plays to win.”

Feltingoff points out that one of
the most important aspects of ten-

nis is the mental aspect of the‘
game. This is something she feels
she needs to improve.

”When'I play a lot of matches
in a row, the outcome depends
a lot on my mental frame of
mind, whether I'm mentally pre-
pared or not,” said Feltingoff.
”You can only get mentally ’up’
and prepared for matches so
many times, then you start to lose
your concentration.”

”I have to work on my concen-
tration,” continued Feltingoff.
"After I play so many matches in
a row I seem to lose my killer in-
stinct and find it hard to concen-
trate. Another thing I- have to

11

work on is my patience. Some-
times I will play a pointjust to get
it over with.” V

The Lady Panthers are not quite
halfway through their seasonand
have a I-4 record. They have "al-
ready played against their tough-
est competition of the season.

Dieffenbach feels that Feltin-
goff has responded well to pres-
sure of playing at No. I for the
Lady Panthers.

”Feltingoff is responding well
to the pressure,” said Dieffen-
bach. ”She has to face a tough
player i n every match, even ones
against weaker schools. Her
game can only benefit."

I don't know too much about

I, Arizona as of yet. They'll proba-

bly just have another solid Season__
and beat Arizona State in their
finale, as usual. ‘But they won't

_beat UCLA this Saturday.

Clemson-13 Georgia Tech-12
Georgia Tech could pull Off the
upset if Clemson takes them too
lightly. But it's tough for Tech, or

V anybody-, to win in Death Valley.

Second Upset of the Week
Missouri-28 Indiana-14
The Tigers can equal their win

total of last year (3) ‘in just their
third game with a win Over Indi-
ana in Bloomington. Missouri has
already beaten Baylor, and a
seven-win season is a good pos-
sibility. Indiana disappointed last
week in getting Crushed by
Kentucky. b .

Miami-20 Arkansas-17

Miami Could be looking for-
ward to next week's game with
Florida State, and against Arkan-
sas, that Could be fatal. Superior
talent will take Over for mighty
Hurricanes.

Oklahoma-42 Tulsa-3

Who says only Oklahoma gets
to boost their record with easy
games?
