been ill at Saranac Lake, N. Y., for
fourteen montlis, will be glad to
know that his condition is. greatly
improvedyand that he is now allow-

tary has been in pretty close corre-
spondence with “Bill” since his ill-
ness, and has been giving him all
the Pitt news not covered in, The

“Bill’s_:f’ recent letter of January 26
will be of interest to Pittites, espec-
ially the following: ’ ‘
“If you should see ‘Jack’ Thomp-
son tell him I enjoyed his selection
on the wireless Monday evening. It
was queer but I had nine different
stations that evening, and I just
tuned in on East‘ Pittsburgh in time
to hear him say! that the next would
be Jack. Kind of brought me back
to old Glee Club days.”

Duncan writes‘ that they are hav-
ing . wonderful weather at Saranac,
the temperature being forty degrees
;below on the night of January 25. It
happens that Dr. J.. N. Hayes, Med,
’16, formerly varsity . baseball star,
is a physician in Saranac Lake, and
he ‘and Duncan ‘get together quite

' Although since his‘ appointment as

ﬁnancial supervisor, he has been able .
. to devote butlittle time to a study of
, the situation, Mr. Hoehl stated that
social events in the past have become

ﬁnancial. disasters because of one or
on combination of two or more of the
following E conditions: T

"1. The event has been held, either
-on the same date or within a few

“days of a similar event and interest

therein has, consequently, been insuf-
ficient to render the event self-sup-
porting. ’ V I '
., 2; _ Many. social events are held
solely as a result of over-enthusiasm
on the part of as few students, whose

' desire to “put on a dance” persuades

them to make the attempt although

’. V the interest of the majority imthe or-.
? ganization is only lukewarm. ,

V 3. Mismanagement and the devel-

 '@opment of plans on an extravagant

.-scale when the income from the event
is by no means assured. .As an ex-
ample, of this cause for failure, a re-

 Tcent ‘dance held by one ‘of the under-
_.- graduate classes was cited. Compli-

mentary‘ tickets had been profusely
distributed, a larger ballroom than
‘necessary for. the occasion had been
«engaged and ten dollars’ worth of
tickets were promised in return for
advertising space worth three.

4. The unfortunate practice” in-

wdulged in by -Pitt students of post-
» poning the purchase of tickets until

and the" committee in “charge works

largely*’-» in the dark. At a recent
dance heldipunder the direction of the
Student Senate but four: tickets had

 been sold when the dance began and
‘ ﬁnancial loss appeared

inevitable.
However, an hour later the ballroom
ﬂoor was crowded and a handsome
proﬁt was turned over ’to the treas-

-urer of the Senate as a result. This

condition, the , graduate manager

, _fe.els,m.ust’ be 'rVect‘iﬁed. It is his opin-
ion that'in justice to the members of

V purchasing
tickets suiﬁciently long in advance. to
enable social committeeséto develop
their plans accordingly. . .

_ '0 doubt, the graduate‘ manager
stated, there‘ are manyzreasons other
than the foregoing which are respon-

sible fa!‘ social events resulting in

loss? but it is his opinion that those’
stated -above are the most common;

He. has announced that when either

of the first two conditions. are found
to exist,‘ no permit to hold the event
will be issued. The third condition
he hopes to eliminate by proper su-
pervision. As for the fourth, he has
announced that hereafter sufficient
tickets must be sold in advance to in-
dicate‘ that success is not only pos-
sible but highly probable. The “gamb-
ling chance” will thus, it is: hoped, he
removed-. _. ' .
Although, due to lapse of but V a
short time since his appointment as
ﬁnancial supervisor, Mr. Hoehl has
not been able todevelop a system in
all its details, heannounces that the
procedure in brief will probably be as;
follows: ’ . ‘
When a: student organization de-
cides to hold a dance or other social
event and a committeeihas been ap-

pointed for that purpdse,’ the chair-
man, after scheduling the. eventwith.

the Student. Life and Interests Com-
mittee and complying with the regula-

.' tions of that body, will call at Mr.

I-Ioehl’s0oﬂice in Room 1, State‘fHa1l’,
and there make out an application for
the issuance of a provisional permit.
to hold» the affair. The application,
form has been so designed that the
graduate manager will be supplied
with full information as to personnel
of the committee in charge, nature of
the function, where and when it is to

be held, approximate cost, contem-.

plated assessment and the number of
the organization voting. in favor of
holidng the. event. ‘ P

This application when completed" in

a1l‘.it"s details will be referred tothe
‘graduate manager,'who, after confer-
ring‘ with the members of the Senate
serving as. his“ assistants, will,? if

it scored .16 points more than their
Methodist opponents from Meadville,
However in the second half, our sterl-

mely conspicuously by his absence. In
that half Pitt seemed unable to score
any goal from the ﬁeld after Leven-
son scored his field goal to the outset
of the half. Only the big lead gain-

In the ﬁrst half _ the Pitt defense

to register a goal from the ﬁeld, but

by nine points when the game ended.
The entire Pittteam played goody
basketball, during‘ the e ﬁrst -half, but
in the second“ half Youngk was the

foul shooting was rather good, as he
was successful in 18 _out of 24 at-
