Board of Trustees chair
announces retirement

Byjason Hillman '
Managing Editor

Ending a five-year term, John Marous announced his retirement as
chair of the University of Pittsburgh’s Board of Trustees last Thursday.

, Marous, who received criticism for his role _in former Pitt President
Wesley Posvar’s $3.3 million retirement package, will remain on the

[board as a charter trustee.

Retired chair and chief executive officer of Westinghouse Electric
Corp., Marous wrote a letter to the board about his retirement. He said
his term as chair has ‘reached a natural conclusion now that the
transition to new leadership has been completed and the short—term

mission that accompanied it.

That mission included installing J. Dennis O’Connor as Pitt’s
chancellor, restructuring the board in accordance with the ad hoc
committee recommendation and completing the appropriate audits
and responses to the auditor general’s report.

“With the ‘completion of the short—term mission, we are now ready
to formulate an appropriate long-range strategy for the next decade.
Recognizing the importance of this transition and the need for
continuity of leadership to effectively implement such a long-range
plan, I believe the time has come for my retirement as [chair] of the

Americans need to create a new society
based on human values, independent
presidential candidate Ron Daniels said.

Daniels, who spoke Saturday in David
Lawrence Hall as part of Malcolm X Day,
said that to create such a society
oppressed people in America need to
“build a powerful new movement from the
bottom up that is going to shake this
nation.”

Daniels blamed existing policies,
capitalism and “corporate vultures  whose

only concern is for money” for the social '

and economic inequities that currently
exist in the United States. _

He noted that 10 percent of the American
population controls -80 percent of the

Daniels applauded the rioters in Los
Angeles, but he said their actions were
really an insurrection and a revolt against
oppression.

“1992 is already the year of the battle or
the bullet," he said.

Daniels criticized the Bush administration
for its lack .of concern» for the poor
and poverty-stricken in this country.

“I found it interesting that President
[George] Bush could sneak into the Hill
District and act like he’s concerned about
blacks and poor people,” Daniels said,
noting that the very same conditions
exist just _ 10 blocks from the White
House. . . ' . '

He also criticized Democratic presidential

front-runner Bill Clinton. He said Clinton
was intelligent enough to win a Rhodes
scholarship “but not intelligent enough to
know he was golﬁng in an all-white
country club.”

‘ Daniels told the audience not to vote for
“Tweedle Dee or Tweedle Dum” in the
November elections but to remain
independent _

,“We will always be independent,” he
said.
Daniels also told the audience to

remember, “Racismis alive and well in

America."

Daniels; a native of Pittsburgh, has
served as the head of several African-
American groups including the National
Black Political Assembly and the National
Rainbow Coalition, and he was Jesse

Jackson's» 1988 Presidential campaign.

Another highlight of the evening was an

“Unity is imperative to whatever we

PA CT oﬂers support system for AIDS patients

By Vincent Gadrix
Staff Writer

In 1987, the life Mark knew
came to an abrupt stop —— he
tested HIV-positive. His life that
was ﬁlled with friends, work and
travel was replaced with fear and
questions.

In confronting uncertainty and
attempting to get answers, finding
people to talk to became one of

. his first challenges.

After moving back to Pittsburgh
he was able to talk to his family,
though many people infected
with the HIV virus have no one to
talk to.

For over 250 people who have
tested positive for HIV or AIDS,
the Pittsburgh AIDS Center for
Treatment (PACT) has been the
source of medical treatment, while
also helping patients to deal with
social, psychological and ﬁnancial
challenges related to the
epidemic.

The University of Pittsburghﬁgii

and Presbyte_rian-University”
Hospital established the clinic in

1989. PACT provides primary
medical care through an
outpatient clinic to persons who
have tested positive for HIV or
AIDS. -

Dr. Susan Hunt, the clinic's first
physician and medical director,
said she has watched PACT grow
to include two part-time
physicians, an administrative
director, a nurse practitioner, a
clinical social worker and a
financial interviewer.

For the staff members at PACT,
teamwork is the way they help
their patients and each other.

“I think the team approach is
important, not only for the patients
but for us,” Hunt said. “A lot of
our patients are not used to being
patients, and they might come
from backgrounds where, for
whatever reason, they are not

used to using the medical system ‘

or they may be suspicious of the
medical system. I think the fact
that they have a number of people
that- they can
relationships with is very
good.”

develop «
 ‘become a--7 group, and it.’ is Very

Before 1987, Robert traveled
and held a full-time job in the
computer field. He had three
friends who died of AIDS, but he
said it happened so fast he did
not have the chance to see how
they coped" emotionally with
different aspects of the virus.

“When I was first diagnosed
HIV-positive I was scared because
I did not know what to expect.
There was a lot of uncertainty. I
did not know how much time I
had left. I did not have anyone to
talk to,” he said. “The medical
personnel give me a comfortable
feeling. They always have an
open air and I enjoy talking to
them. They introduce me to
different types of programs and
options.” '

Along with treatment, the staff
becomes a group with which
patients can explain fears and
ask questions. ,

“We may be the only people
that a patient can discuss his or
her HIV infection [with]. So we

important for the patients,” Hunt

said. T

Along with offering patients a
social and emotional outlet, staff
members find that teamwork is
the most effective method for
dealing with and understanding
the current and developing
aspects of the AIDS epidemic.

Penny Mateer, the center’s
clinical social worker, said the
reason this approach works is
because one person cannot do it
alone.

“Nothing is ever the same here,”
she said. “All the problems that
are presented are different every
day, not just medically but socially
— something comes up that we
have never faced or never thought
of.”

Although staff members said
the team approach is the most
efficient way to help patients and

, sol-ve problems, they also see the '

group as a way of dealing with
their own stress. and emotions

that come from working with the
.- AIDS epidemic. '

Pittsburgh is also known for the
Sports Garden, in case you can’t

East Carson Streets and was voted
the number one sports bar to

By Carmen M. McGill
For The Pitt News

In order to preserve Pittsburgh’s heritage a pro—active
rather than reactive role must be taken, Mary Paradise,
president of Preservation Pittsburgh, said.

Paradise spoke as part of a university art gallery panel
discussion last Wednesday at the Frick Fine Arts

building.

Other panelists included city council memberjames Ferlo,
John Santis, Susan Brandt, John Martine and Robert Gangwere.
“I believe the Sphinx is saying ‘Why didn’t [you] act

sooner?”’ Ferlo said.

He noted that in retrospect he would now do a number
of things differently in an effort to aid the preservation of

historical landmarks in the city.

_ Santis commended Ferlo for his participation in Preservation

Pittsburgh.

for us is because there is a
group of us and "all of us are
helpful and supportive of each
other in working through the
hard times,” Mateer said.

“We certainly have a lot of
deaths but sometimes some of
them are harder than other
times. It makes you stop and
think about all the people who
died before,” Mateer said.

“I guess the greatest challenge
of it is to deal with that and yet
at the same time keep going;
you know what you have to
do and see the next
patient.” ‘

Kate Coddl-Palmer, PACT’s
‘nurse practitioner, said the
group offers a safety net for
each staff member.

“I think the other thing that
can get you through the hard
times is being able to feel safe
enough to say,‘ ‘Today I cannot
deal with it and I do not really
have it in me to see this patient’
or ‘I am having a tough day,”’
she said.

Palmer said that dealing with
their emotions quickly and up
front enables them to deal with
stress at that moment and makes
it easier to go on.

it all with you and are never
able to let go is when it becomes
very difficult,” Palmer said.

Hunt said that it is important
to keep professional distance
with a patient. ‘

“It seems like‘ when you take A

She said that a best friend
cannot also be a physician, nurse
practitioner or social worker
because the objectivity of the
professional relationship is
lost.

“On the other hand, we are all
human and I think that seeing
another human being suffering,
seeing another human being" ill,
is painful to us,” she said. “I
think that we are able to express
that with a patient and among
ourselves.

Professional distance is right
because you cannot get good
medical care from a family
member. You lose your
objectivity and your role in terms
of the patient.

Although the staff members
are at PACT to help the patients
medically as well as to help
them adjust to the new
challenges they face, Palmer

said that ultimately the
patients teach the staff
members.

“I think that in many ways
they teach us much more than
we can ever give them,” she
said.

“We do the work and watch
them change and get to the
point where they are coping
and adjusting through life as if
they were never diagnosed

Obviously their lives will
never be the same, but they go
on and it is an amazing thing to
watch.” A

Strike

but Burnett disputes that

statement.

“I can’t say it strongly
enough..This is not an effort
by the Press to hurt the Post-
Gazette,” he said.

Although impossible to
predict the long—range effects
of the strike, Burnett said
historically when there has
been a strike the newspapers
lose a fair amount of circulation
and have great difficulty
getting it back.

“It’s a terrible situation
because you get advertisers
and subscribers used to doing
without you. It will be up to us
to market our products a little
better,” Burnett said.

One way of doing that is to
maintain some visibility during

the strike, he said.

The Post—Gazette is trying to
provide the community with news
information through their News
Fax Service and Phone News free
service.

Though all services are currently
free, Burnett said the phone
services during the strike will
eventually be expanded into 1-
900 lines similar to those offered
before the strike began.
Information such as horoscopes
and in-depth sports reports
will be available for a fee, he
said.

Local and regional news
prepared by the Po5t—Gazette staff
will also be offered by the Post-
Gazette Radio News Network,
which will be a long—term
service.

“We are preparing to provide a

news service. Strike or no strike,
we plan on making this service
available. Instead of moving in
low gear, we’re shifting into
high gear. We think we have
something that would
benefit a radio station,” Burnett
said.

Notter said the
distribution system was an
attempt to provide greater
flexibility to the advertisers.

“The judge rules for the
Teamsters, and he said that the
Pre$s’s action was illegal; it was
unfair labor practice,” Morobitto
said.

“They actually want to cut the
union down. They want to
eliminate about 50 percent, and
in past practices that is a union-
busting tactic,” Morobitto
said.

I Bon Voyage

Summertime at the University of Pittsburgh brings about
many changes. During the summer of 1990, former Pitt
President Wesley Posvar announced his retirement. In the
beginning of the summer of 1991, the university announced
its selection of]. Dennis O'Connor as Pitt’s new president.

This year’s high—level administrative change also
coincides with summertime. Board of Trustees Chairjohn
Marous announced his retirement, seven months after the
Student Government Board, the Faculty Assembly, the
College of General Studies, the Student Council and the
University Senate Budget-Policies’ Committee asked him
to resign.

Marous will remain a member of the Board of Trustees
despite a lack of faith from diverse university bodies.
Marous claimed that he was unaware of the outrageous
$3.3 million retirement package for Posvar. When the
package became public knowledge, Marous said he was
not aware of the retirement plan. His name appeared on
the documents approving the pork-barrel retirement deal.

Given Marous’s departure, the Board of Trustees is now
prepared-to re-establish credibility. As Marous stated in
closing remarks, “We [in the universitycommunityl are
now ready to formulate an appropriate long—range strategy
for the next decade.” Now is a time for change within the
Board of Trustees. A leader who can provide impeccable
honesty and represent the diverse Pitt community would
be a wise choice for the university.

Telling the man

With college graduates facing the worst job outlook in
20 years, President Bush should expect discontent on the
campaign trail. With his low performance on domestic
issues now joining low standing for his handling of the
economy in opinion polls, students at the University of
Notre Dame were able to express their dissatisfaction.

On Sunday, President Bush spoke at Notre Dame’s
commencement ceremony. Over one-fourth of the 2,353
.gtaﬁuats:S nratestczqlhis C£7.I..I1.f1‘1€),l1.<-‘§3if~I1€«f;1¥..~?1.'€.1.f.ll«T€.3.S.S ;bY1w.earing
arm-bands. Bush spoke of the disintegration of the
American family as the root cause of our society’s woes.
However students were not fooled. Criticism came during
.an address by the class Valedictorian, Sarah J, McGarth.
She accused the federal government of failing the global
community by neglecting the environment and of failing
the United States by ignoring class and racial divisions.
_ “The United States can no longer call itself the victor of
the Cold War or the one remaining superpower,” according
to McGarth. “Such rhetoric does not bespeak of the
interconnectedness of all peoples.” McGarth emphasized
the importance of dialogue in the global village and
chastised the “guns and robbers” foreign policy of the
Cold War espoused by the Bush administration. McGarth
deserves special recognition for speaking out against
Bush — her courage is lacking in politicians, let alone
graduating seniors. «

Bush, sitting behind McGarth, looked perplexed during
the live C-SPAN coverage. At one point, while McGarth
critiqued economic divisions tearing families apart, Bush
opened a commencement program and began leafing
through it. Sitting in shame, Bush is beginning to be forced
to hear criticism of his administration. Whether it is in
Pittsburgh's Hill District, where he spoke last week, or at
Notre Dame, Bush can no longer keep sticking his head
in the sand.

Rethinking justice for juveniles

While children and teens under
the age of 18 strive to be treated
as adults, 13-year-old Cameron
Kocher is getting a little bit more
mature than he intended. About
three years ago in northeastern
Pennsylvania, Kocher became the
youngest juvenile to be tried as
an adult for homicide in America.

It all started on a snowy winter
day when school was canceled.
Kocher spent the morning
innocently playing Nintendo with

friends. ' _' ‘ 

The kids were getting rowdy
and the kitchen was getting dirty,

, so the mother of Kocher’s friends
sent the kids outside. Everybody
else went to ride the snowmobile
while Kocher went to his empty
home.

After he found the key to the
gun cabinet under the lamp, he
unlocked the cabinet and took
out his father’s .22—calibe‘r riﬂe.
He opened the window and took
off the screen and started to play
“hunter.” The gun fired and shot
his seven-year old neighbor.

Now Kocher is tied up in a
legal nightmare. He is charged
with criminal homicide, and if
convicted of first~degree murder
he faces a maximum penalty of a
life sentence —— a pretty grim
future for a 13-year-old.

Lawyers are debating how to
treat the boy, as an adult or as a
juvenile delinquent. A delinquent,
under Pennsylvania law, is
someone who is under the age of
18 and “shows that he is
amendable to and in need of
treatment ...”

Psychologists have concluded
that Kocher was perfectly healthy
and aware of what he was doing.
Judge Ronald Vivian decided to
treat Kocher as an adult partly

based on his “adult-like reaction
to the shooting.”

An “adult-like reaction” does
not make , an adult. The
psychological’ differences
between an adult and a child are

Scott
N espor,

great. The’ psychological
expectations for an adult are totally
different from those for children.
Children are only able to see and
relate to things on their own level
and are unable to see issues as a
whole.

Kocher might be perfectly

healthy for a 13-year-old. But a’

13-year-old’s mentality is still
developing. An adolescent is not
a miniature adult and should not
be treated as such. Some people
go so far as saying Kocher’s
treatment is equivalent to child
abuse. ’

Kocher isthe victim of a judicial
system which does not know
how to deal with the increase in
juvenile crime. The courts have
recently seen this rise in juvenile
crime and are looking for ways to
deter it. With no end in sight,
officials are frustrated with looking
for a solution and the children’s
welfare is being forgotten.

Each year there are about 250
children under the age of 12 who
commit homicide. According to
the American Bar Association the
“vast majority” of these cases go
to juvenile courts. Why didn’t
Kocher’s?

Kocher is the victim of his
parents’ misjudgment. They were
the ones who left a gun in the

reach of a nine—year—old. Guns
are too much of a temptation to

A children.

In an effort to act older, boys
like to behave asmen in the Wild
West or. Desert. Storm or
someplaceelse for “real men.”
Real guns are more attractive
than the plastic jobs and therefore
should not be within children’s
reach.

Kocher was just playing
“hunter,” a game he played when
he went on hunting trips with his
father. He was taught how to use
a .22 caliber riﬂe and was allowed
to shoot at rabbits and birds.
What did he learn about gun
safety?

Kocher is the victim of
emotional stress from the trial. In
addition to being expected to act
like an adult, he has become the
center of a controversy that has
attracted the attention of national
media. He goes to a boys’ school
where he is expected to do‘
schoolwork. With everything
going on, he is unable to be a 13~
year-old.

Once more, a juvenile is not a
miniature adult and should not
be treated as such in an important,
serious situation like atrial for
homicide. If Kocher is not mature
enough to drive a car, then how
can he be expected to stand the
intimidating trial?

Given the various emotional
changes and development
Kocher has ‘ yet to undergo, a
homicide trial and subsequent
sentence will not benefit society
or Kocher. The judicial system
should’ stop this abuse of
children.

With its vibrant, upbeat,

The Three Rivers ‘Shakespeare

Festival has _tr“ans3fo_rmed
' Shakespe‘are’s‘ Two Gentlemen Of
Verona into a— musical

masterpiece.

The production _is attacked in a
Gilbert-and-Sullivan} style, with
witty, fun songs '(2'Svto’be exact)
scattered throughout the
performance. The numbers break
up as well as act out the dialogue.
While watching, = you have to

The audience is involved
throughout the play. Characters
face and speak directly to the
audience many times, and they
actually seem to transfer some of
their energy in these exchanges

The scenery and costumes also
contribute to ‘the playful
atmosphere. “Each backdrop is
full of color: Shades of green,
gold, blue and red are found
throughout them. The costumes
are brightly and vividly colored,
also: Hot pink boots, emerald
green jackets matched with red

of the cast.

The play is, for the most part,
romantic. It follows the adventures
of two close friends, Valentine

gentlemen of Verona.

Valentine leaves Verona for
Milan in hopes of ﬁnding. his
fortune there. While in Milan he
meets the Duke’s daughter, Silvia,
and the two soon fall madly in
love and make secret plans to
elope.

But the Duke desires his
daughter to marry someone else,
spurring just one of the conflicts
in the play.

While Valentine and Silvia are
expressing their love, Proteus is
in Verona professing his love to

Antonio, insists that his son join
Valentine in the Duke’s court.
Before Proteus leaves, he and
Julia exchange their rings so they

While the Spanish may know a thing or
two about love, they certainly don’t know
anything about pulling off crimes of love.
Nowhere is this more evident than in
Vicente Aranda’s latest export Lovers, slated
to open this Friday at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse. ,

Based on a true story, Aranda’s stirring
chiller revolves around two females’ desire
for, one man. Fortunately the film isn’t
nearly so naive and uncomplicated,
although it does waver in its ﬁnal moments
despite its harsh exit.

Lovers is undisguisedly a foreign ﬁlm —
from the blatant subtitles to the energy
and sophistication thrust at the “erotic
thriller” genre — forcing more erotica than
thrill. While Hollywood, dabbles in the
excessive in this ﬁeld, i.e., lots of overblown
acting, st'eamy,l_p_assionless sexual
appearances and a healthy dose of violent,
mood—infested moments, Aranda plays it
looser, painting simpler, themes and not
engagingin broad character developments
of despair and immediacy.

He lets the picture drip onto the canvas,
molding itself, not smearing it in
plainness. '

Planted ﬁrmly in mid-ﬁfties Spain (the
time of Franco’s- ‘obsessive rule), Paco
(Jorge Sanz), a boyishly handsome man
from the provinces, completes his military
service and plans to marry his
commandant’s maid;-Trini (Maribel Verdu).
His search foran apartment leads him to

‘~‘.--:3. ‘.s‘0v- .:--~- ‘)1’-N - .‘.~".x-.. 4-. .~ --

a “fateful” mating with Luisa (Victoria
Abril), a ferocious “landlady” who rents
him a room and proceeds to lead him into

a world of uninhibited sexual escapades ‘

and deceit.

Paco ﬁnds his compulsive admiration,“

for Luisa too strong for even his moral
virtues, and he '5 led on a path to Purgatory,
courtesy of Luisa’s underground
connections and sexual prowess. In debt
15,000 pesatas thanks to faulty business
dealings, Luisa seduces Paco into thieving
the money from T rini’s savings by agreeing
to marry her (T rim) and take over (together,
as a means for support) a pub in Northern
Spain.

From here on it’s a good vs. evil motif.
Will Paco really steal the money and
abandon Trini, for whom he still has deep
feelings? Will Luisa kill T rini to save her
own face and her-man? Is the virginal T rini
aware of the scam? And so on and so
on. V

While the ending could go as many
different ways as Roget could group words
together, the viewer is unsure of the
outcome. until its traumatic and hasty
ending. The suspense is neither nailbiting
nor overly dramatic but rather a natural
chain of events, bound to occur
because of Luisa’s charged feminine
dominance.

Abril, who graces the local screens for
the second time in a month —— having
recently starred in Pedro Almovadar’s High
Heels— garnered the best actress award at
the 1991 Berlin Film Festival for her
performance in Lovers.

Her character, Luisa, is an obsessive
temptress who manipulates Paco with high
intensity, freewheelin’ sex (check the
handkerchief scene). She is on the edge of
life, earning cash by scamming and luring
“tenants”.into her lair. While her character

. is sketchedas wicked (Pacorefers to her

as a “witch”), the beautiful Abril ignites the
screen with her presence and command.
(Who wouldn’t fall for those big black
beetle eyes?) Disguising hesitancy to ask
Paco to kill Trini as the old caring-and-
concern routine, is prototypical in the
estranged ‘thriller role, but Abril doesn’t
give in to the rigorous emotional demands
of the type.

Her character rarely loses its edginess
and is never consumed in all—out
desperation despite its obviousness.

And unlike Glenn Close in the much
compared (at least genre—wise) Fatal
Attraction, her control is showcased by
her ability to direct her circumstances by
using others (“Kill her, Paco,” she mutters
coyly and quickly near the ﬁlm’s ﬁnale),
not leeching to them and admitting her
own weaknesses.

Sanz’s Paco works as well because of his
slick, youthful charm and innocence. He is
no match for the overbearing Luisa. While
Trini ponders how to recapture her stud,
she's smart enough (thanks to the momma

figure of the commandant’s wife) to realize '

that her cooking and cleaning isn’t enough"
to satisfy her man.

After giving herself to the now love-
smart Paco, she shoves it ﬁrmly in Luisa’s
face by waiting outside her apartment,

where she just committed the act. This
scene is one of the ﬁlm's highlights, and
while it hints at the toughness of Trini’s
nature, she too is forced to succumb to
Luisa, whose in-bed tactics are no match
for the young Trini.

The ﬁlm doesn’t go without its m ents
of fun either. When the confused Paco
asks Luisa who her underground scam
friends are, she says, “Isn’t it obvious?
Fees, he studied law, and Fatso, he's the
short, thin guy with the moustache.” For
Paco, nothing is obvious — he is utterly
lost as he istorn between his perfect
homemaking match, Trini and his playful
partner, Luisa.

Lovers is engaging because of its
seductive plot but more importantly
because of its characters. As T rini realizes
that Paco is committed to Luisa and she
falls into mope-mode, becoming

momentarily suicidal, it is obvious she has -

lost her lust forlife (Paco).

And even as her character falls into

morbid thriller types with overly obsessive/
depressive qualities, she is able to accept
her fate and to ask for it, something that
would send Hollywood into a self-reﬂexive

Pitt awaiting NCAA ruling

By Brian Gallagher
Stajf Writer

With the year-long in-house

investigation of infractions.
committed during 7 t-he; ‘Mike-

Gottfried football era cori§iple_te,
the Pitt Athletic Department
begins to wait. ' I _ 2

It waits for a response from the
ruling committee of the NCAA
and quietly speculates about
possible penalties. And it waits to
see how the allegations of
improprieties will affect alumni
and fan support.

For Pitt’s athletic department
and its loyal backers, the waiting
is the hardest part.

Following last" week's
announcement of rules violations
involving the Pitt's ‘football
program, the NCAA begins its
meticulous and often lengthy
investigation process of the
alleged wrongdoing, which
occurred between 1986 and
January, 1991. G

The process, which involves
an investigation and judgment of
both the program and Pitt’s
findings, follows a standard form

of action, according to NCAA.

Director of Enforcement Chuck
Smrt.

Following an initial review of
the allegations, the NCAA will
determine the extent of its inquiry
into the program in terms of the

' particular size and attention the

investigation warrants.

After the inquiry, anticipated to
last several months, is complete,
those conducting the investigation

   

infractions are major or
secondary.
If rules infractions are

determined to be of secondary
nature, Smrt said the NCAA’s
actions would be dealt via written
correspondence and would not
necessarily be made public. For a
major infraction however a
hearing would take place.

“If they [violations] would be

considered to be major violations, '

then the institution would appear

before the committee in a hearing

format," Smrt said. “If it goes to a

hearing format, then it's the staffs ‘

beliefthat it’s a major case.”

It  under" this “major case”
moniker that words like
“probation” and “sanctions”
surface. ’ _

“If it’s found by the committee
to be major in nature, then there’s
a minimum penalty for a major
violation," Smrt said.

The minimum penalty for a '

major _.infr_action is two years
probation, no post-season or
television play fora year and
possible restriction on
scholarships and- recruiting visits.
Smrt added -that the minimum
penaltymust be enforced unless
the. committee. finds a unique
exception involving a speciﬁc
school with’ a major violation.
Twoexamples of such unique
exceptions include a cooperative
program that reports its own
infractions and a situation in
which those involved with the
wrongdoings no longer work for
the respective institution. Both

in ruling that makes the process 

conditions do not always result in
a lighter penalty. An example of
falling on the wrong side of the
ambiguous unique exception
interpretation is Robert Morris
College's basketball program.

They incurred major penalties
for rules infractions in 1990, while
nationally-known programs like
Clemson University football and
UNLV basketball received minor
probation and delayed penalties,
respectively;

Robert Morris was handed a
two—year probation, loss of two
scholarships, and no post-season

Robert Morris’s Director of-.9

Athletics Dr. Bob McBee.

“Clemson had 13 cases -lof-j

basically got slapped on the wrist;  

while we got hit hard. 
“And with UNLV, getting

Lemieux’s return sparks Pens to 52 Victory

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

Mario Lemieux is back.

The mention of the word “back” in a
sentence about Lemieux usually draws
gasps of dismay from Penguin fans. This
time it wasn’t a problem with the su perstar’s
bad back, it was the return to the lineup
of the one of the best players in the
National Hockey League in time for game
two of the Wales Conference Finals, as the
Bruins visited the Civic Arena.

If one player was the key to the Penguins’
5-2 victory to take a 2-0 leadin the series,
it wasjaromirjagr, not Lemieux. Lemieux
has said in the past thatjagr could become

the best player in the world, and it seems’

both coaches would agree.

Pens coach Scotty Bowman putjagr on
the ice as much as thefyoung right—winger
could play, the way {Lernieux has often
been used. Bifuins céiéiifh "Rick Bowness
used Don"Sweeney,”w'ho shadowed
Lemieux in last.seasjon’s conference final,
to shadow Jagr. Most of all, Jagr seemed
to be the focal point of jplay, the guy his
teammates "always tried to get the puck to
and his ‘opponents always look out for —
the way Lemieux has always been. He had
one goal and two assists. What was
Lemieux’s return worth? 0

“About three points,” Pittsburgh winger
Troy Loney said ‘after the gamein which
Lemieux scored two goals and had one
assist. “Even withAtlfie;§l;ij:rn'itedl minutes he
played, he’s a fo'r’ce'.”4.._L‘..,._.=:*"

The excitement from the return faded
quickly. After the Penguins were stopped

. .7“ .., 3, ,,‘.

on two early scoring chances, the Bruins
took a 1-0 lead on a goal by rookie Glen
Murray only 59 seconds into the game.
Boston center Adam Oates set up Murray
right at the front of the goal, and the
youngster chipped it over Pittsburgh goalie
Tom Barrasso.

The Pens finally scored shortly after the
power play. Brian Trottier won a face—off
cleanly, letting Jagr set up defenseman
Paul Stanton for a shot from the ‘point.
Loney tipped it by Boston goalie Andy
Moog to tie the game at 6:02 in the first
period.

-They ﬁnally took the lead asjagr scored
with 2:53'remaining in the period. Loney
dug a puck out of the corner and dished
it to center Ron Francis, who fired it to
Jagr, all alone in front of the net. Jagr
pulled the puck to his backhand and ﬁred
it over Moog, who had gone down early,
for a 2-1 Pittsburgh lead;

Jagr nearly scored again moment later,
but was stooped by one of many
spectacular glove saves by-Moog on the
night. i

Lemieux hadn’t done much up to this
point and was ﬂexing his injured hand as
if it was really bothering him. Then he
made something happen. He took the
puck from two Bruins and threw it toward
the net. Kevin Stevens dug it out and
dished it to Rick Tocchet for the goal and
a 5-1 lead. It was not only Lemieux’s first
point since returning, it was the first point
for Stevens in three games.

Barrasso ensured the lead would hold
for the rest of the period with a diving
stop. In the third period., the Penguins

were able to hold up the Bruins at the blue‘

line every time they tried to enter the
Pittsburgh zone. Boston didn’t pose much
of a scoring threat for the first nine minutes
of the period.

At 9:35 of the period Phil Bourque of the
Pens was called for an elbowing penalty.
The Bruins quickly converted as Oates
scored from in front off a pass from Ted
Donato at the point, making the score 3-
2.

The Penguins responded two minutes
later after Tocchet drew a penalty from

Boston center Dave Poulin, who drew .0

two penalties himself in the first period.
On the resulting power play, Stevens
grabbed a rebound and set up Lemieux on
the doorstep. Lemieux stopped the pass
with his backhand, pulled it back and
chipped it over Moog to make it 4-2.

The Penguins scored yet another empty
net goal as time ran out when Jagr set up
Lemieux, ﬁnalizing the score at 5-2.

The series now goes to Boston. The
Penguins were in a situation similar to the
one the Bruins are in now during last
season’s conference final, going home
trailing 0-2. The; Pens came back to win
four straight and’ take the series on the way
to their Stanley Cup championship.

The difference was that the Pens
controlled game two last season and the
Bruins were very lucky to come away with
the win. While many Penguin players felt
they didn’t play well and were lucky to
win game one of this year’s series, the
defending champions decidedly controlled
game two. Besides, they have Lemieux 
and Jagr.

too. And that didn’t seem to help
us.".

NBA's Final

Four ready
for playoffs

By Rob Pugliese
Senior Staﬂ“ Writer "

It’s the Final Four, NBA style. The
two best teams in each conference
adfi/a_nced"_.to their respective
conference-"ﬁnals and the excitement
level in this year’s playoffs has
reached a superior level.

The Eastern conference has been
marked by a _tension and passion
the .likes of which haven't been
seenin the ﬁrst two rounds in a long
time. The New York—Detroit war
was a classic. A beauty for the
basketball purist longing for some
old-fashioned in—your—face
defense.

The Western conference has been
running at breakneck speed.
Gameplans here are get on the
boards, push it up and shoot it up.
The only club out west to stray from
that style is the Utah Jazz. Their
slowdown game survived the L.A.
Clippers and wore out a young
Seattle club. But now the Jazz meet
the hottest club in the NBA., the
Portland Trailblazers. .

consecutive appearance in the

Western ﬁnals and is hungry for
a champoinship. Undoubtedly,
there is more pressure than ever
on the high—flying bunch from
Rip City, but the Blazers aren’t
showing it nearly as much as last
season, where their playoff
performances varied from game
to game as much as Cliff
Robinson’s headband colors.
Portland continues to posess
the most lethal fastbreak in the
NBA with Terry Porter feeding
the fiercest wingmen in
basketball, Clyde Drexler and
Jerome Kersey. Porter didn't have
one of his better regular seasons,
but he’s come alive in guiding
the Blazers to a 3-0 sweep of the
Lakers and a 4-1 dismantling of
Phoenix. Porter averaged 26
points per game against the Suns
and picked it up again in
Saturday's 113-88 trashing of the

Jazz in Game one of this series. '

He opened the game by hitting
two three—pointers, closed the
half with one, and opened the
second half with another bomb.

All told, Porter connected on six
of eight treys, en route to 26
points. On a red—hot club, Porter
is the hottest. Try 22 of 39 three-
pointers in the playoffs so far.
The scariest thing about Game
one was that Portland built a 34
point lead with Drexler as merely
a role player. He continues to
raise the level of his game and
pick up the play of his teammates.
Justice was served last week when
the Glide was named to the U.S.
Olympic team, but Drexler truly
deserved the league’s MVP award
over Micheal Jordan. Drexler has
been the best player in basketball
all year and icy in the clutch and
has now developed into a
superior defender as well. There
is nothing that he doesn’t do
well. His defense onJeffHornacek
was the main reason Portland
blew out Phoenix so badly.
After Portland eliminated the
Suns, Kevin Johnson said that
Portland has the characteristics
and quality of a champoinship
team. The key is everyone is
more consistent, hungry, and does
whatever it takes. Kersey is

unstoppable on the glass and his
defense has improved
tremendously. Porter scored
when needed, and sat back to
run the show when needed in
outplaying KJ at the point. The
Blazers know they are the most
talented team in the game, but
now they work harder, are
focused, and play relentless team
defense.

Cynics have doubted Utah for
their playoff failures of 1984, ’8S,
’88, and '91, but the Jazz looked
impressive by diffusing an
explosive Supersonic club. The
Jazz’ supporting cast has finally
blended smoothly to provide solid
backing for th l—2 hammer of
Karl Malone and John Stockton.
The much—-maligned Jeff Malone
has been red—hot, breaking the
Sonics down in every key fourth
quarter situation.

to win, but merely to keep it
close.

Portland can’t lose. They are
too refined and efficient at the
halfcourt game as well as the
break. If you look at their
athleticism, shot—blocking, and
dunking and almost forget about
how stingy their defense has been.
That’s what separates the Blazers
from the rest. Karl Malone delivers
through rain, sleet, and snow,
but the Mailman is drown in a Rip
City tidal wave. Portland in five.

The Eastern finalists know each
other well. The Chicago Bulls
survived a gallant New York club
despite being outplayed for th
first six games of the series. If not
for poor free throw shooting and
some untimely turnovers, the
Knicks would have wrapped up
the series in five or six games.

demonstrated why he’s one of
the true clutch players in the
game today. For all those who
haven’t been giving the Cavs
their just props, stop sleeping.
Cleveland will be no pushover.
Fifty—seven wins doesn’t happen
by accident.

These clubs play the exact same
brand of basketball, so their won’t
be any surprises. Cleveland’s
talent is more than enough to
play with the Bulls but what this
series hinges‘ on is the Cavs’
mental toughness. Cleveland
must go hard and physical for
seven games.-

Some say that Cleveland cannot
win by playing their style straight
up against the Bulls, but I
disagree. As much as Jordan can
potentially dominate in this series,
the Cavs can offset. that with their
tremendous ._fro-ntcourt ad-
vantage. "- v ~ . ..

Larry Nance was a big key in
the Boston series, blazing away
with that 20-foot face—u p jumper.
His post up ability’ will trouble
Horace Grant, and when
Cleveland sends Hot Rod Williams
into the fray, the Bulls could
have some serious match—up
problems. Brad Daugherty
enjoyed. tremendous success
against Boston, simply
annihilating Robert Parish. He’ll
have another "big series agianst

- Bill Cartwright, the ultimate has-
been who did absolutely nothing
against the Knicks.

Onthe ﬂipside, Scottie Pippen
is just too quick for any of the
Cavs’ forwards. He’ll disrupt their
interior unless the “nice” Cavs
get nasty. Mike Sanders, who
came up huge against Boston,
could get a shot at checking
Pippen. Craig Ehlo isn’t relishing
his job since Jordan regularly
eats him alive. The best thing for
Cleveland to do is to give Jordan
his 35 points and keep role players
like John Paxson and B.J.
Armstrong from getting involved.
