(UPI) -— The Pittsburgh Press
reported Sunday it has obtained
documents that back a city claim
that the sale price of the U.S.
Steel Building was undervalued,
enabling the buyer and seller to
avoid paying more than $2 mil-
lion in taxes.

The city is also challenging the
sale prices of nine other city
buildings. ‘

The Oct. 29, 1984 sale price of
the U.S. Steel Building down-
town was reported at $293 mil-
lion. The actual price was $360
million. The deed transfer taxes
and the 1985 property tax assess-
ment were based on.the lower
figure. The city has filed a deed
transfer tax claim against the
buyer.

The firm that bought the
building was a New York-based
company called 600 Grant Street
Associates. Pittsburgh has asked
the County Board of Property
Assessment, Appeals and
Review to reassess the U.S. Steel
Building. A hearing is scheduled

Steel building sale questioned

for March 29.

The owners will be liable for
$2.4 million in state and local
deed transfer taxes and up to
$1.9 million per year additional
property taxes if the city is
victorious.

The 64-story U.S. Steel Build-
ing is the largest of the 10 build-
ings involved in the tax dispute.
In those cases,‘ which extend
back to December 1982, the city
charged that sales prices were
underestimated by a total of$ 143
million.

Seven other downtown build-
ings are having their sales prices
contested. They are: One Oliver
Plaza, Oliver Building, Porter
Building, Park Building, Alleg-
heny Building, Investment
Building and Standard Life
Building. Also being challenged
are the sale prices of the Armour
Meat Packaging Plant and the
Negley House, a nursing home.

Hearing dates pushed back
for two Pitt football players

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

One hearing date has been re-
scheduled and another postponed
for two freshmen on the Panther
football team.

Safety Dante Wiley and wide
receiver Tony Williams were origi-
nally set to appear before District
Diulus last
week, each on one count of simple
assault.

Wiley will appear before Diulus
Thursday at l p.m., one week aftera
postponement forced the new time.
Wiley, from Jeannette, Pa., is the
object ofa suit brought by freshman
John Ashley, who claims Wiley
punched him in the face Feb. 2 on
the l2t_h floor of Lothrop Hall.

A Judicial panel has already
recommended several sanctions on
which Vice President of Student
Affairs Conney Kimbo has yet to
rule.

A warrant has reportedly been
issued for Williams’ arrest after he

_ failed to appear for a 9 a.m. hearing

Friday. Fourth-year junior Staci
Camp filed the assault charge
against the freshman from Freedom,
Pa., claiming Williams punched her
in the face Feb. 7 outside Lothrop
Hall. 5

Coach Foge Fazio has taken no
known disciplinary action against
Wiley, and he neither denies nor
confirms Williams’ indefinite sus-
pension. In a press conference set for
noon Thursday to kick off spring
practice, Fazio is expect_ed to
announce Williams’ status for the
upcoming season.

Pitt’s Greek Week celebration
comes to a sucessful close

By Nadia Moritz
The Pitt News

Greek Week I985 drew to a close
Saturday night with. 320 exhausted
Greek dance marathoners and
$21,800 raised for Eye and Ear Hos-
pital of Pittsburgh.

Since l973, Pitt Greeks have been
serving the Pittsburgh community
with their week of amusement and
philanthropy, but according to
Greek Week overall chairman
Kathy Brown, this year has been one
of the most productive. —
. “We started this year’s project
with three goals: $50,000 for Eye and
Ear Hospital, a high level of organi-
zation and to have fun,” said Brown.
“So far we’ve achieved two ofthem.”

The l2,000 student Greek popula-
tion has managed to collect, so far,
over 2,000 cans of food for the Pitts-
burgh Food Bank and over 14,000
pints of blood, and when the

remainder of the charity money is-

collected this week, Brown expects
to achieve all three goals.

The 1985 Greek Week activities
began last Saturday with Greek
Sing, the highlight competition of
the week, when each ofthe 30 sorori-
ties and fraternities perform a six-
minute song and dance routine. The
week continued with blood drives on
Monday and Tuesday, a chariot race
competition on Monday, Fun and
Games night on Tuesday and a food
drive and Greek mixer on Thursday
night.

The competitions were conducted
with six match groups, five fraterni-

.ties and sororities in each, compet-

ing in the various events. Prizes were
awarded for the top three match
group places in each event, plus indi-
vidual sorority and fraternity
awards for Greek Sing and overall
winners. All of the money raised will

go to Eye and Ear Hospital of
Pittsburgh.

Eye and Ear Hospital, which
treats 75 to 100 patients a day, pro-
vides area residents, most of whom

‘have no other access to medical care,

with special ophthalmology (eye
care) and otolaryngology (ear, nose
and throat care) treatment.

The money raised by Pitt Greeks
will be used to completely equip new
eye and ear examining rooms in the
outpatient Ambulatory Care
Center.

As part of the University Health
Center of Pittsburgh, the Ambula-
tory Care Center is also involved in
training eye, ear, nose and throat
physicians, clinical research and
modern technology to induce an
environment, according to senior
vice president Dan Kraft, “that far
surpasses the demands of specialized
care.” 0

According to chairman Kathy 9

Brown, the two characteristics that
set Greeks apart from any other
campus organization are their phi-
lanthropic goal and the special qual-
ity of Greek relationships.

“What makes Greek Week so spe-

c cial is the fact that we are raising

money for a charity  that is our
primary goal,” said Brown. “One
half of the Greek purpose is philan-
thropic. Every sorority and frater-
nity has their own philanthropy to
raise money for, plus the Greek
Week charity. ‘We are out to work
for the community.”

Former president of Kappa Alpha
Theta, Skye. Lawson, agrees. “It
gives everyone a chance to see the
other side of Greeks,” Lawson said,
“the side that contradicts the stereo-
type of parties and pranks. It shows
that we do work for someone besides
ourselves.”

Another quality that makes Greek
Week special is what Brown calls
“the special bonds ,of Greek
relationships.”

“The Greek experience goes much
deeper than any other because it
gives you a sense of sisterhood and
brotherhood,” said Brown. “lt’s uni-
que when a group of 50 to l0O people
can band together and develop a
bond that is not only social but
spiritual.”

This makes the closeness of the
groups much stronger and the inspi-
ration for the Greek Week competi-
tion much stronger.

Theresa Colecchia of Kappa
Kappa Gamma agrees. “With Greek
relationships, you are committed to
another person, the people of your
sorority, not just/an abstract cause
or idea," said Colecchia. “Part of the
reason I’m here is because I love eve-
ryone in this sorority. I wouldn’t be
willing to give that much to any
other organization.”

“It’s personally inspiring, too,”
said Pi Lambda Phi president Steve
Bowser. “You feel good because you
are doing something for someone
else who really needs your help.”

The Oakland community,’ Brown
said, has been especially supportive
of the.Greek Week effort. “They’ve
given us 100 percent," Brown said.
Roy Rogers has donated $7,000 in
trophies, McDonalds donated the
food for the dance marathon and
local businesses participated as indi-
vidual sponsors.

The University of Pittsburgh
administration, Brown said, has not
been as supportive. “The only prob-
lem l have with the administration is
that they do not give us due recogni-
tion. They never really come out and
say thanks,” said Brown. “I think the
administration should take Greek
Week more seriously in terms of
promoting the good side of the
Greeks.”

Lutheran minister Roth arrested

(UPI) — Lutheran Minister Douglas Roth is back in the spotlight.
Roth and six of his followers were arrested yesterday in Upper St.
Clair Township by Pittsburgh police. Roth and his followers appar-
ently did not respond when told to leave the Faith Lutheran Church
after being refused admittance to services. Roth has already served
ll2 days in jail for contempt of court.

The Faith Lutheran Church decided March 7 to ban members ofthe
Denominational Ministry Strategy and the Network to Save the Mon
Valley from church premises.

Earlier yesterday morning, Roth held services for approximately 30
people in front of his own church, Trinity Lutheran Church, in
Clairton, Pa. The group stood on the sidewalk outside the church
instead of on church property as they had on previous Sundays.
Lutheran Church officials had warned them last week not to trespass
on church property. ’

Clairton Police Chief Ken Udevich saidfthat Roth and his followers
could stay on the sidewalk if they allowed people to pass. Former
church council member Kent Milton, who is not a Roth follower,
walked along the sidewalk at one point saying “pardon me, pardon
me."

Roth follower Dale Worton confronted Milton, but police quickly
moved in and separated them. Several neighborhood residents also
yelled at the Roth group, but there were no other incidents.

Roth held services five days after a church committee had decided
that he should be defrocked for violating church orders.

Roth said that he will continue to fight for the unemployed and will
continue to hold services outside of Trinity Lutheran Church even
though. he faces defrocking.

Meter jammed

Students who commute to the University of Pittsburgh by
automobile are well acquainted with the horrendous parking
problem in Oakland. Countless conversations have been cut
short with a hurried, “Gotta go feed the meter.” Familiar is the
sight of a windshield wiper with a ticket underneath, the carbon

paper fluttering in the breeze.

Recently, the parking problem was severely aggravated by

‘ the institution of permit parking in south Oakland. Residents
may park all day if the proper permit is purchased, but for those
without a permit, parking is limited to one hour. This effec-
tively cuts off an important source of free parking to the

commuting student.

This is not to criticize the city council for its action. The
residents of south Oakland have a legitimate right to park close
to home and should not have to contend with non-residents’
automobiles forcing them to park a block or two away. Not
onlyshould permit parking solve that problem, but it should
prove to be, in government parlance, a revenue enhancer. The
city will not only earn money in permit fees but will gain
additional money in the form of fines issued to those who park
longer than the allotted hour. Many of those fines will doubt-

less be paid byiPitt students.

Therejust aren’t enough options open to the commuter with
a car to park. Other than the profusion of parking meters
throughout the Pitt campus, there are a few places for a Pitt
commuter to park a car. There is the lot by Trees Hall, where
j for $2 one may park without fear of the predatory meter maid.
But it is along walk up and down Cardiac Hill for most
students and a very cold walk in winter. There is also the small
lot at the bottom of Panther Hollow. While it is less remote, it
has room for only a few dozen or so cars and is rapidly filled in
the morning. Business is quite good for the private lot that is
also in Panther Hollow. But it, too, is rapidly filled to capacity
in the morning, leaving the commuter to circle the streets of
Oakland in search of an empty parking space.
There are quite a few university-owned permit parking lots,
but they are‘ provided for faculty and other employees of Pitt,
not the student whose ever-increasing tuition helps to pay

employee salaries.

The overwhelming majority of students live off campus, and
most of those commute from outside the Oakland area.

If PAT does cease operating, the already bad parking prob-
lem will become intolerable. Now is the time for Pitt to provide
its students with inexpensive, centrally-located parking. The
administration fiddles while the city of Pittsburgh fills its
coffers with the quarters and fines paid by Pitt students.

Letters to the Editor

FARRAKHAN

.Hate Bacillus ,

We are writing this letter‘ in
response to the letters of Adam
Eisenstat and Camille White (March
13) that recommend that the Black
Action Society invite the Rev. Louis
Farrakhan to speak at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. We are adamant-
ly opposed to giving a forum to an
individual who is an outspoken ad-
vocate of racism and separatism. We
base this opinion upon the public-
ally available excerpts from Louis

Farrakhan’s speeches, radio
addresses, articles and public
appearances -(New York Times,

June 28, I984; “ABC News Night-
line,” April 5, 1984; et al).

Camille White claims that Far-
rakhan should not bejudged a racist
until he is heard in person. In effect,
Ms. White is claiming that there is a
conspiracy in the media to distort
Farrakhan’s message. The problem
with this argument is that it employs
a tautology based upon paranoia in
that all that has been attributed to
Rev. Farrakhan. is inherently false.

Adam Eisenstat argues that by
giving Rev. Farrakhan the oppor-
tunityto speak, he will expose him-
self for the racist that he is.
Unfortunately, this is historically
dangerous: Allowing Hitler to incite
the crowd only led to the silencing of
rationality, and the consequence of
tolerating a known hateinonger led
directly to the deaths of at least ll
million people. Hate is like a bacil-
lus. If one exposes a large enough
population to a germ, some are cer-
tain to become infected with the
sickness. We do not need to expose
ourselves to disease to know that it
will.

We purport that there is no differ-
ence between the opposition to this
university’s financial involvement in
South Africa and Louis Farrakhan’s
proposed forum. We believe that it is
vitally important to educate our-
selves in order to combat racist atti-
tudes as espoused by Rev.
Farrakhan or other like-minded
individuals. There are positive
methods of education that do not
include the teaching of hate and can
serve this purpose constructively.
Furthermore, we feel that this type
of programming serves only to alien-
ate the student body by reinforcing
the negative barriers that have im-
peded our progression toward
equality.

This is not exclusively a black-
Jewish conflict but a struggle of all
people against racism. We have not
forgotten the dream of Dr. Martin
Luther King. Let’s work together
and make this dream a way of life.

Stingy Art

I have played the piano for nearly
20 years. I’m also a law student.
Until recently, I never thought of the
two as mutually exclusive, but the
Pitt music department has forced me
to reconsider.

As an undergraduate (at a differ-
ent school), I was used to at least one
piano in every public building
(dorms, cafeteria, etc.). Upon my
arrival at Pitt, I was informed that
any piano not under lock and key
would soon be vandalized. I didn’t
mind walking to the Music Building
once or twice a week to keep from
getting rusty. Recently, however, the
music department has decided to
restrict the use of its practice rooms
to music students only.

They have also decided to change
their policy on renting pianos as
well. Last year the law school was
able to rent a piano for its talent
show from the music department.
This year the department claims that
“all pianos are needed for classes.”
This means that the producers of the
show, myself included, have to rent a
piano elsewhere (no luck so far) or
use an electric keyboard, which is
useless for our classmates who had
planned to play Gershwin or
Chopin.

I realize that careerism is the trend
in university education these days,
but such selﬁshness on the part of
the music department is inexcus-
able. Any non-music student who
doesn’t know someone with a piano
is out of luck. Music students should
naturally have first priority over
their facilities, but that shouldn’t
require refusing such facilities to all
other students. From now on, the
music department should receive a
new classification in the course
catalog: Stingy Art. Also, any music
student found in the law library
(unlikely, I admit) should be booted
off the premises immediately.

Recklessness

Although I do not profess to
know everything about the law, I
feel compelled to address some of
the assertions made by third-year
law student Alan Sodomsky in the
recent article, “Heyward Lost to
Probation.”

Mr. Sodomsky makes some
unsupported statements concerning
the legalsystem. According to the
article, Mr. Sodomsky said that “in
our society we don’t punish people
[without] two elements: the act and
the intent.” Mr. Sodomsky went on
to state that without the act and the
intent, a person cannot be punished.
I am surprised that anyone would
maketsuch a clearly erroneous asser-
tion. I guess Mr. Sodomsky has for-
gotten that our casebooks offer
many examples where a person is
criminally punished for acting in a
reckless or negligent manner.

While on the subject of
recklessness, it appears awfully
strange that Mr. Sodomskynever
mentioned that the hearing board,
as stated in The Pitt News, did ﬁnd
that‘ Craig Heyward acted in a
reckless manner.

Mr. Sodomsky also apparently
does not know what “intent” is.
Unlike the term cy pres, a legal term
that is heard infrequently during law
school, intent is a word that is drilled
into the minds of first-year students
almost before they sit down for their
first class.

Intent is a relatively simple
concept to grasp. An example
sometimes given to illustrate the
word goes as follows: X is standing
on the street waiting for the king and
queen to ride by in their coach. X
hates the king but idolizes the queen.
As the coach is going by, X, with
absolutely no intent to harm the
queen, throws a bomb into the coach
killing all the occupants. Did X
intend to harm the queen? Did
Heyward intend to injure two
students when he looked at them,
lifted up his crutch and struck them?
Of course, fhe law is not blind. I
wish Mr. Sodomsky would
discontinue the rhetorical game he is
playing and ask the board members
who. presided over the Heyward
hearing whether or not they found
intent.

About 98 percent of the law
students who attend law school

lear_n_ . the relatively simple
definitions of intent and recklessness
early on during their legal

education. Others either forget the
definitions or conveniently distort
them for their own beneﬁt.

From Under My Desk/ Dan Bates

Of Curious

While wandering through the
streets of New York City this past

week, I was summoned by the

Columbia Broadcasting System to
P€1’f0§m my duty as . both an
American TV viewer and a typical
tourist. .

You see, the fate of a new
television show was placed in my
hands —— well, almost. It was sort of
like jury duty.

I ‘was called for duty while
walking aimlessly down a New York
street, overwhelmed by the tall
buildings, fancy hotels and the thick
smoke drifting in my face from the
grill _of a local soft pretzel vendor.
Moving along, I stumbled into some
guy holding a large stack of tickets
for the CBS screening of a new TV
show.

He looked at me and said, “Hey, I
got these free tic ...”

“I’ll take one,” I snapped. Well,
why not? After all, they were free.

Tourists,

“Are you at least 25 years old and
an American citizen?“ he asked.

“Of course_ I’m an American
citizen,” I responded, cleverly
evading the first part ofthe question.
He gave me the ticket.

Later, as I stood in line in“ the
lobby of the CBS building, I
anticipated many great things: Just
think of the many stars I would
meet. Imagine me, a mere tourist,
standing before this screening and
determining the future of a new TV
show. And yes, I felt important.

But I was wrong. Our entire group
was merely herded into a small room
with a 20-inch TV. I saw no
celebrities, and I certainly didn’t feel
important. We were there, though,
to do ajob, so I tried to keep it all in
perspective.

A young, well-dressed man (I
think he was a yuppie) who
identified himself as a researcher for

the production research department
at CBS, entered the room and began
to explain the proceedings. ‘‘First,'’
he said, “anyone who cannot stay for
the full one hour and 40 minutes,
please leave at this time.” Now I was
sure this was too important to walk
out on. It was my duty to stay.

We were supposed to watch one
segmentof a new television series
and_ acknowledge what we liked
about it and what we didn’t like
about it. Each person was given two
silent electric buzzers, a green one to
press when we thought it was good,
and a red one ifwe found it bad. Just
think, the entire fate of this show
was determined by the pushing of a
button. How dramatic.

If we saw something we liked
during the show, we were supposed
to push the red button, or was it the
green button? Anyhow, this was
going to help the researchers
determine whether or not to run the

show in the future.

The show, entitled “Detective in
the House,” was about an
engineeer~turned-detective who
worked for his senile boss, had a
dippy nag for a wife and several
obnoxious children. This was quite a
show.

Armed and ready to go, the
attentive audience watched. As it
progressed, I would hit the red
button, and, occasionally, I would
hit the green button. As the show
became more and more boring, I
would hit the red button, then the
green button. Then I would hit the
green one first. Red-green,
green-red, green-green, and so on. I
soon developed a random pattern,
like the answers to a multiple choice
test.

Wondering how anyone else
could endure such a dragging story,
I looked around. On my right, a girl

New York Streets and CBS

reclined, sound asleep. So that’s how
they did it. Others were talking, and
one person threw down his buttons
and walked out. I guess it was just
too much for him. I could relate.

After the show, those of us who
were left had to fill out a I0-page
questionnaire about it. Did I like the
show? What didn’t I like about the
show? How did I see each character?
I tried to be nice until they asked me
if I would prefer that show to
“Magnum, P.I.“ What could I say?
Would I prefer this to “The
A-Team?" That was it. I could hold
back no longer. After that, I was
merciless (and tired). The heck with
my duty.

Thanks to curious tourists like q

myself, most TV viewers can avoid
such awful programming. And
besides, we were each rewarded
cheap ballpoint pens, which I'm sure
ma-de it all worthwhile for everyone.
My jury duty was complete.

There is a strange new craze in
Squirrel Hill. Walk into the new
shop Just Petites on any Saturday
and it is a madhouse. Women are
sharing dressing rooms, changing in
the bathrooms, even in the storage
rooms. The women are just like
children in a candy store for their
first time. Why?

Because until recently, petites in
Pittsburgh have been ignored. For
the first time, there is a place that
caters only to women 5-4 and under.

Store owners Madeline Kramer
and Steve Hecht took time out of
their busy schedules to talk about
designers’ growing interest in small
sizes and to offer advice for petites.

The Pitt News, Monday, March18, 1985

Being small in size does not mean
one has to look short. There are
tricks to help the petite appear taller.
Kramer offered these:

0 Match the color of your stock-
ing to the shoes you are wearing.
This will add length to your legs. Or
for the longest length possible,
match skirt, stockings and shoes.

0' Buy simple clothes that have
vertical accents. An example is an
unbelted chemise (a dress without a
waist).

0 Wear skirts that are not too full.
They should be proportioned to
your size.

0 Try not to fracture your look by
wearing colors that contrast too
much. Dress in the same range of
colors. This does not mean that you
have to be navy blue from head to
toe. Rather, try a light blue top, a
darker blue skirt and accessories
also in the same color range.

0 Avoid bold horizontal stripes;
they make a person instantly look
shorter.

‘ 0 Long necklaces can add length
because they hang vertically, but
don’t overdo them. mu.‘

0 Jewelry should be proportioned
to one’s size. Since petites are
smaller everything should be scaled
down.

0 A hanging sash will not only add
length, it will draw attention away
from a large waist.

0 Don’t ever wear ﬂats. Any heel
at all will add to one’s height. Weara
high heel with a long skirt and a
short heel with a short skirt.

The needs of petites are finally
being met by the fashion industry.
Hecht said: “In the past year, many
designers have made a portion of
their line to fit petites. Hundreds of
designers want to capture this
market." According to Hecht, the

Squirrel Hill store caters to Pittsburgh’s petites

latest studies show that 39 million
American women are petites. This is
30 percent of the market.

Just Petites is the only specialty
store in Pittsburgh that caters only
to the smaller woman. It opened in
July 1984, and in the first year, “sales
have exceeded our expectations,”
said Kramer.

The customers seem satisfied with
their find. Kramer said: “Our custo-
mers are loyal. They have found
their niche and are happy. They
come in and try on five outfits and
buy two. They all say one thing:
‘Everything fits.’ "

For spring, the owners suggested
two items to pick up a drab war-
drobe. Of one, a piece of chunky
jewelry, Hecht said: “It will‘ cost
between $6 and $16. A necklace like
this will not only change an outfit’s
appearance but can plCI( up a per-
son’s mood.” The other item is a

Sleep center for children opens at Pitt

By Alison Sterne
The Pitt News

The largest, most comprehensive
sleep and neuro—endocrine center
devoted to the study of adolescents
and children opened Feb. 15 at the
University of Pittsburgh.

Located on the seventh floor of

._ Western Psychiatric Institute and

Clinic, the center will focus on the
study, treatment and evaluation of
illnesses that affect the sleep system
and certain sleep problems.

“There are two aims of the pro-
gram,” said Dr. Neil Ryan, the _direc-
tor of the Child and Adolescent
Depression Program. “To look at
primary sleep disorders in children
and adolescents and to look at sleep
and neuro—endocrine changes in
other psychiatric disorders.” Neuro-
endocrine changes refer to changes

in the nervous system.

“There are sleep abnormalities in
depressed adults,” Ryan added.
“Are there in children?”

Questions about sleep abnormali-
ties in children are difficult to
answer since very little research has
been done on children and adoles-
cents. According to Lisa Rossi, the
assistant manager of the university’s
Health Sciences News Bureau, only

,_a small number of children have

been observed up until now. These
observations have taken place in
centers geared for the research of
adults.

The Western Psych center will
treat children and adolescents
specifically.

Children with specific sleep prob-
lems will be treated through the
Sleep/Wake Disorders Outpatient
Program. The director of this pro-
gram is Dr. Margaret Cushman.

todepression will be treated through
the Child and Adolescent Depres-
sion Program, which is headed by
Ryan.

Some children need to stay over-
night to be observed. These children
come to the center in the evening and
are given a tour of the facility. The
children are prepared . for bed
between 8 and 9 p.m. This prepara-
tion includes the taping of elec-
trodes, which measure the electrical
activity of the brain, eye movement
and muscle tension, to the child’s
head.

Children who suffer from depres- —

sion will, in addition to undergoing
observation, take special neuro-
endocrine tests to determine the bio-
chemical nature of the depression.
Depressed children who show
neuro—endocrine changes will be
treated with anti-depressants and
psychotherapy. These children will
need to‘ spend severaldays and

nights at the center.

“What we hope to do is study
about 150 children a year -— approx-
imately one third with primary sleep
disorders, one half with depression
and one sixth with other psychiatric
disorders,” Ryan said.

‘The program will also study unaf-
fected children for comparison pur-
poses, according to Ryan. “There is

still a lot to be found about normal _

sleep patterns in adolescents,” Ryan
said.

The center is a long-term project
of Western Psych. It consists of six
bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen-
ette and a sophisticated control
room. There are also accommoda-
tions for parents who wish to stay
overnight with their children.

Western Psych already houses a
center that observes the changes of
sleep patterns in adults, the Adult
and Geriatric Sleep Center, which
has been in operation for l0 years.

a hot item on the market now.

It used to be that petites were dis-
suaded from wearing a lot of differ-
ent items, aceording to Kramer.
“But today," she said, “nothing is
taboo, provided that it has been pro-
portioned to their size. But I would
never wear anything that is unﬂat-
tering or too oversized. You should
love your purchases."

Kramer also suggested that petites
read a book called, “Short Chic, The
Everything You Need to Know
Fashion Guide for Every Woman
under 5-4.” It costs $14.95 and is
published by Rawson and Wade
Publishers Inc.

97 safe after
Hijack thwarted

(UPI) --— The state-run Saudi
news agency said Saudi Arabian
security men killed an air pirate yes-
terday after he detonated a hand gre-
nade aboard a hijacked Boeing 727
jetliner. '

The six-hour hijacking began as
the Jeddah-to-Kuwait ﬂight was
approaching the Rivadh airport for
a stopover. An unidentified man
commandeered the plane and forced
it to land at Dhahran airport in East-
ern Saudi Arabia.

The Saudi Defense Ministry said
everyone aboard the ﬂight was safe.
Apparently, all 76 passengers and a
crew of 21 had evacuated the aircraft
before the grenade exploded.

Tornado kills one,

(U P1) —- At least two tornados
touched down in central Florida yes-
terday. The worst damage was in the
Venice area. A twister slammed into
a residential area, killing one person
and injuring 40 others. A second tor-
nado touched down 100 miles away.

Pitt to celebrate

Deaf Awareness Day

By Mary Daigle
The Pitt News A

Sign Connection, a student activi-
ties group,’ is sponsoring Deaf
Awareness Day this Thursday in the
William Pitt Union Assembly
Room.

Karen Walkney, the reigning Miss
Deaf Pennsylvania, will be speak-
ing, along with radio personality
Ken Mease.

According to Walkney, the pur-
pose of the event is to show students
and the public what deafness is
about. There will be representatives
on hand from various deaf service
groups from around the area. They
will be present not only to educate
the deaf on what services are availa-
ble to them, but also to educate the
hearing so that they can better
understand the needs of the deaf.

The Registry of Interpreters for
the Deaf will be at the event to pro-
vide information on their work-
shops, which help train interpreters.

The Catholic Office of the Deaf
will also have representatives on
hand with information of‘ their
work. “The C.O.D.i holds masses in
Sign Language for a congregation of

about 1,500 people. They also pro-
vide counseling services for the
deaf,” said Beth Jaynes, secretary of
Beautiful l-lands, a dance troop that
sings by signing.

“C.O.D. gives the deaf commun-‘
ity the chance to go to church and be
able to participate instead of going
to a regular church and not under-
standing what is going on,” said
Walkney.

Beautiful Hands, Walkney’s
dance troop, will be performing
Thursday throughout the day. “The
musical productions of Beautiful
Handsare for the enjoyment of both
the hearing and the deaf. Our main
purpose is to show everyone how
beautiful music can be by using your
hands instead of singing,” Walkney
said.

Other performances for Deaf
Awareness Day include children
from area junior high schools and
the Pittsburgh Deaf Theater. The
YMCA Camp Get—together for the
hearing impaired from ages 5-18 will
also have demonstrations of their
activities.

Also given will be a demonstra-
tion ofa TTY, a device used to com-
municate by phone to a deaf person.
It is a typewriter keyboard -with a
small screen. Instead of talking,
messages are typed.

through July 1.

In addition to the new shelters,
existing shelters such as the Good

were expanded. “The new shelters
are not up to capacity yet,” said
Joyce Rothermel, who helps coordi-
nate the Jubileepshelter uptown, “but
so far, we have been able to find
shelter for everyone that wants it.
Not everyone who is homeless
accepts shelter when it is offered.”

obtain zoning occupancy permits
and determines what staff is needed.

Barnes ‘The Ruli
showcases Pitt M.F.A student

By Sandra (Zappa
The Pitt News

It's irrational, it's irrepressible, it's
irresistible!

lt’s Peter Barnes’ “The Ruling
Class,” one ofthe most enduring and
thought provoking satires of con-
temporary theatre, combining
unpredictable theatricality with bit-
ing wit. This comic energy will be
unleashed in the Steven Foster
Memorial when the University of
Pittsburgh Mainstage opens its final
show of the season on March 21.
The show is a preview of the March
22-April 6 production directed by
W. Stephen Coleman.

Coleman, who heads Pitt’s
M.F.A. Acting program, cites the
I972 film version of Barnes’ play as
an inspiration for the Mainstage
production. “I was absolutely
dazzled by the wit of the piece more
than anything else. It’s rich in ideas,
humor and theatrical presence,” he
said.

“The Ruling Class” is a powerful,
satirical attack on the British aristo-

cracy. The cruelty and coldness of
the upper middle class is brilliantly
put across as Jack Gurney, who
inherited his father's vast estate and
title of Earl of Gurney, is scorned as
a freakish outcast while he preaches
the love of Christ, but he is later
welcomed back with .open arms
when he takes on the personality of
Jack the Ripper. “The Ruling Class”
raises important questions: What
exactly is the price one must pay to
be a member of the “ruling class"?
What is the loss to one’s humanity?

“The Ruling Class” is a perfor-
mance vehicle for third-year M.F.A.
student Steven Brown to fulfill his
thesis requirement in a challenging
Mainstage role. “It’s a role of great
substance, and I had a lot of support
and fun with it,” said Brown. As
Jack, the character Peter O'Toole
portrayed in the film, Brown enters
one of the many idiosyncratic and
disturbing characterizations of this
black comedy.

Jack’s transition from a charming
and insane family heir whogthinks
he’s Jesus Christ to a “normal”
member of the Gurney family pro-
vides Brown with a complex role.
Brown describes Jack Gurney as a,

Class’

character “so steeped in tradition of
nobility and privilege that he has to
escape all this by believing he is the
God of love. He is told that he is
false, making the logical transfor-
mation by becoming Jack the
Ripper, thereby gaining approval by
becoming the god of hate."

His character’s transformation
brings the ruling class and the inten-
tions of Britain’s upper echelon in
society and government into an
illuminating and frightening light.

Brown's performances with Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh theaters have
included Mainstage roles in “Good”
and “Orpheus Descending" last sea-
son, as well as I984 appearances in
the City Theatre Company’s
“Crimes of the Heart” and the Three
Rivers Shakespeare festival.

“The Ruling Class” opens with a
preview on Thursday, March 2 l , at 8
p.m. The comedy continues Thurs-
day through Saturday at 8 p.m. with
Sunday matinees on March 24 and
31 at 2 p.m. Tickets may be pur-
chased by charging to Master Card
or Visa at 624-4101, or in person at
the Stephen Foster Memorial after
noon daily.

A Message from the Presidents

After assuming our ofﬁces, we planned and implemented the
following activities:

1. Winter Rush — Sorority and fraternity membership is up
by more than 10 percent since 1984. Plans for next year’s Fall
1985 Rush have already been completed, and we are anxiously
awaiting the fall term. '

2. Presidents’ Conference — Chapter Presidents
attended the annual Presidents’ Conference at the Harley
Hotel on February 22 and 23. Sessions on rush, time manage-
ment and a variety of other areas were conducted during the
twoday retreat.

3. The Northeast Interfraternity Council and Panhel-
lenic Council Conference — The Executive Boards of the
Panhellenic and IFC Councils attended this year’s conference
in Boston. Over 600 other students from schools throughout
the Northeast attended the fourday conference. Countless
workshops were held and all were informative. Many ideas
were brought back to use in our system here at Pitt.

4. Fall Conference 1985 - This fall we are planning to hold a
joint conference with Carnegie-Mellon University. It will
include speakers of national prominence in Greek program-
ming area. ,

These are just a few of the programs on which the Interfrater-
nity Council and the Panhellenic Association have been work-
ing. 1985 will prove to be an eventful year and we welcome both
Greeks and non-Greeks to become a part of it.

Laura Ferlan, Craig Strauss,
President Panhellenic Association President Interfraternity Council

By Nasos Georgiadis

‘ One nice, warm day three years ago, I came from Greece for my
first time in the U.S. to study at Pitt. I was assigned in a room in the
suite numbered 11E in Bruce Hall — on the international floor — and
from September ’82 to January ’83 I got to know all 10 people: my
Nigerian, British, Iraqui and Brazilian suitemates, a couple people
from the floor below me and a couple people from the floor above me.
For four months, my life consisted of the following exciting places:
Bruce Hall, Benedum, Hillman and McDonald’s (I hadn't discovered
the “O” yet). The bars, the only place that I knew I could meet any
people, were “no no’s” for an 18-year-old. Not to say that I didn’t try,
of course: when I tried to show the doorman my Greek I.D., where
everything was written in Greek, it didn’t work. So I was sitting in my
room every evening watching everything there was to be watched on
TV, and I was thinking, “Boy, I guess that’s what American life is all
about!”

Then one day something happened that was meant to change my
life in an unbelievable way. I was sitting on my favorite chair, in front of
the TV, and I was reading The Pitt News. No, of course it wasn’t The
Pitt News that would change my life, but a section in it called
“Greeks.” There were all sorts of ads about fraternities and sororities
and one in particular saying, “Come and watch the Steeler Playoff
game this Sunday with us.”

Well, one of the first new habits that I developed here was being a
Steeler fan. So I went to that fraternity and, to my surprise, the
then-Vice President and later President not only’was also from
Greece but from myhome town as well. So he introduced meto the

fraternity .and the rest of the Greek system, which had nothing to do, ‘

of course, with Greece but with the fraternities and sororities instead,
and I found out that besides this frat there were 21 more (and

_ different) fraternities (and 16 sororities) at Pitt. Sol joined the.frater-
nity and I thought that I finally discovered the American way of life: ’

party every Friday and Saturday!

Or was it just that? Well, I’ll have to say no! Contrary to what many
people believe, fraternities are not only for partying and drinking.
Sure, I had fun at these parties, but I got to meet people, too, some of
whom were to become my best friends here. And no, I didn’t buy
friendships with my clues, as some people like to say; every one of
these friendships is true and sincere.

So here I am now looking back, realizing that three years of my life
passed in front of me just like that, and I compare how it was then and
how it is now. By spending time with my brothers I discovered a new
meaning for the word friendship. The fraternity taught me about
leadership and responsibility. It taught me about brotherhood and
teamwork. And most of all, it taught me about myself. I learned from
the opportunities that occurred and from my brother’ experiences
things that I managed to accumulate, and from that typical, scared
freshmanthat I was, I evolved into a more experienced and strong
character and a better leader.

Well, the point that I’m trying to reach with all this self-analysis is
that I amnot the exception of the Greek system, but the typical
Greek instead. Everyone who is actively involved with it knows that I
am right. He knows that, contrary to the Animal House image that
some propagandists have tried to paint of us, the fraternities involve
10% drinking and partying and 90% human relations. The sad thing is
that most of the people don’t know this. They don’t" know the true
facts about the fraternities. They don’t realize that by staying anti-
Greek, they are missing a great chance — maybe the best chance of
their lives — to get involved with a modular democratic society like
the frats and sororities and discover their true selves; discover if they
can lead people or not, if they can assume responsibilities and handle
tough situations before they face the true world as professionals.
They let four years of their lives pass without assuming a single
responsibility, without challenging themselves for anything.

Sure, there are other things besides fraternities and sororities to
get involved with. But how many of them give you the opportunity to
do something not just for yourself but for people who are as close to
you as your real brothers and sisters ~— and sometimes even closer?
In a world so much turning into one consistingof selfish people, it
sounds strange to hear about people who are willing to share with you
their experiences, hopes, successes and failures and build strong
bonds of friendship with you, for the rest of your life. But yes, such
people do exist under the name of brotherhood or sisterhood. And
while one would expect everyone to be involved with this beautiful
system, he finds out that at Pitt, only 1500 out of the 25,000 under-
graduates are taking advantage of it GO GREEK!!

Stop!

America’s most livable city
has a new claim to be proud of:
Pitt’s 22 fraternities and 16 soror-
ities broke fundraising records
by collecting $50,000 for Eye and
Ear Hospital during what Mayor
Caliguiri officially declared
Greek Week.

Greek Week and Central
Blood Bank records were also
broken when over 1,000 pints of
blood were donated during two
blood drives.

An annual event, Greek Week
(March 9-16) is the time for the
1,300 members of Pitt’s Greek
system to unite to raise money
for charity and have fun while
doing it.

To Overall Co-Chairman
Kathy Brown, this year’s Greek

Week was a learning experience.

Watch out Hollywood — here come the Greeks!

\ “lt’s taught me, more than
anything else, that being a Greek
is being special,” she said. “I
never realized the extent to
which Greeks will go to help
their community.” The $50,000
will completely equip a room at
Eye and Ear.

Brown and Co-Chairman
Tom Brizes compiled these
three goals for Greek Week:

0 Raise $50,000 for Eye and
Ear Hospital. “It’s an even, com-
pletely tangible figure, and we
thought it would be a dynamite
thing to hand them a check for
$50,000,” Brown said.

(The most previously raised

A during Greek Week was $45,000

for the Family House in 1984.)

What Does Greek Week.
Mean to You?’ 

“It gives me a great feeling of
pride and satisfaction. I ’m proud
to be representing the Greeks.
Now the administration and the
City of Pittsburgh are getting to
know us.” Tom Brizes, Over-
all Co-Chairman of Greek
Week and member of Delta
Tau Delta fraternity

“The Chariot Race, Fun-N-
Games and the food-eating con-
test are the silly aspects of
Greek Week that give us a
chance to show our spirit. Last
year our chariot broke down.”
Ann Charney, Kappa Delta
sorority

“Free food because I’m in the
food-eating contest.” Michael
Leonard, Sigma Chi fraterni-

tv

“It’s an opportunity for the
Greeks to work together for a
common goal and have fun
while doing it. It’s an opportunity
for me to observe that and
watch them develop from those
experiences.” Bridget Guern-
sey, Co-ordinator of Greek
Affairs

“It’s a time for Greeks to get
together and party a little for
some fun and meet other people,
but also work for a good cause.
It makes me realize why I
became a Greek.” Pete
Dunkelberger, Delta Sigma
Phi fraternity

“Seeing the students put their
energy to good use, that’s been
the best thing I've seen in along
time. Running around and col-
lecting, I can tell they're having a
lot of fun. Our bosses are even
having a good time out of it.”
Evan Johnston, assistant
manager of the Forbes
Avenue and Cathedral of

, Learning Roy Rogers

“Greek Week is the time I’m
rereminded how proud I am to
be a Greek.” Tracy Friedman,
Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority

“G reek Week gives the com-
munity a chance to see what the
Greeks are able to do when they
work together. By working
together successfully, we are
showing the community that the
Greek system is an aid to our
academic programs in helping to

prepare college students for

society: one we hope to better as
we enter into it!” Steve Fox,

Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity

“It’s an opportuity for all the
members of the Greek commun-
ity to get together to know each
other and work toward the com-
mon goal of collecting $50,000
for Eye and Ear Hospital.” Lisa
Vigliotti, Chi Omega sorority

“Having a lot of fun for a good
cause.” Barb Rigby, Sigma
Sigma Sigma sorority

times.

0 Have fun while doing this. “A
lot of the time Greek Week is so
much work people forget to have
fun,” Brown said.

This year’s Greek Week
promised good times for all, from
the Kick-Off on February 1 to
the Greek Week Formal to be
held this Saturday.

The Kick-Off was held in the
ballroom of the William Pitt
Union and included such presti-
gious guests as James Roddey
representing Mayor Richard
Caliguiri, Jack Bogut, represen-
tatives from Eye and Ear Hospi-
tal and the Central Blood Bank,
and Pitt administrators and stu-
dent leaders. '

“The Kick-Off sets off the can-
ning collection for Greek

Week,” said Brown. She des-
cribed “canning”_ as when, “stu-
dents go out and collect money
for a given charity with a can -
at intersections, in front of stores
and door-to-door.” '

The next event was Greek
Sing, in which individual fraterni-
ties and sororities performed six-
minute song and dance routines
in Carnegie Music Hall. “It’s one
of the highlights of Greek
Week,” Brown said, “and it’s
also probably the most
competitive.”

Groups are given a certain
number of points for their perfor-
mance in each competitive
event. Greek Week winners are

determined by how many points.

they have and how much money
they raised and will be
announced at the Greek Week
Formal.

“Greek Week is not cut-
throat,” said Brown. “It’s a
healthy level of competition.“

Last week’s events included
old favorites like: the Chariot
Race, in which match groups of
six raced “chariots” down
Bigelow Blvd.; Fun-N—Games,
where Greeks teamed up to play
games like musical chairs; and
Bar Night at C.J. Barney’s.

The consistantly greatest
fundraising event is the 24-hour
Dance Marathon. Last weekend
over 160 couples collected over
$100 each from canning and
businesses to dance round the
clock.

A new Greek Week event was
Roy Rogers’ Greek Gorge, in
which Greeks Competed to eat
the most roast beef sandwiches
in the shortest amount of time.
Roy Rogers donated the food,
t-shirts, hats and gave $250

charity money.

Roy Rogers donated over
$7,000 to Greek Week this year
for the Greek Gorge, food at
Greek Week Committee meet-
ings and all trophies for Greek
Week (valued at $3,500).

Other major sponsors of
Greek Week included McDo-
nald’s and Pepsi Cola. In addi-
tion, the Central Blood Bank
donated one thousand Greek
Week buttons. .

Publicity included 60 bill-
boards throughout Pittsburgh,
appearances by Brown and
Brizes on the O’Brian and Garry
Show on WHTX-Radio and
Channel 11’s morning talk show,
television coverage of Greek
Sing, B94-FM radiocoverage of
the Dance Marathon and public
service announcements on radio

and TV. .

The Pittsburgh Press and
‘Post-Gazette, as well as local
community newspapers, also
covered Greek Week.

Getting the best possible pub-
lic relations was one reason why
Brown and Brizes chose Eye and
Ear as this year’s charity from
about eight applications.

“Ultimately, the amount of
money we get is contingent on
the amount of p.r. we receive,”
Brown said. “We wanted to take
all the charities that applied, but
we had to decide which charity
would offer us the most public
relations so we could have the
most successful ‘Greek Week.”

Another way in which they’ve
worked to make this the most
successful Greek Week has
been to widely publicize the
goals to all Greeks.

Most importantly, Brown said,
by condensing Greek Week
events into “a mere week” ——- as
compared to spreading events
throughout March, as in pre-
vious years —— students will be
more encouraged to participate.

“People will be more apt to
take a week off, in a sense, from
their studies and participate than
they would to take the whole
month off,” Brown said.

Another change from pre-
vious years is the way in which
the Overall Chairmen struc-
tured Greek Week —— by defin-

- ing all 24 chairpeople’s duties

and responsibilities early on and
developing a network of
organization.

Brown called Greek Week,
“The singular greatest leader-
ship experience that I’ve had.
l’ve learned‘ so much about

 goup dynmcs, public rela-

 

tions, and finance. I think it’s
given me a good sense of what
corporate organization is like in
terms of structure,” she said.

“But what appealed to me the
most was the philanthropic
aspect of the—organization,” she
added. “I really wanted to be in
charge of something that would
eventually donate $40 or $50,000
to a charity.”

She pledged her sorority as a
freshman as a way to integrate
herself into the University sys-
tem. Fouryears later, she has
seen that events like Greek
Week make the Greek ideals
come true.

“I knew I could become part of
a very big and very powerful
group of people (the Greeks) ifl
pledged a sorority,” she said.

" “The idea of sisterhood is no

longer just a concept. It has be-
come a reality for me.”

The Chariot Race is one of Greek Week’s most exciting events.

Keeping the V“

One of the three main goals of Greek Week was to have fun while
raising money.’Keeping that goal in mind, Fun-n-Games was held last

Tuesday.

“Fun-n-Games helped relieve tensions from canning and from all
that rehearsing for Greek Sing,” said Spirit Co-Chairman Fern Oram.

One of the main Fun-n-Games events was a scavenger hunt, in
which members of the match groups were given a list of items and told
to get as many as possible in a certain amount of time.

One item was a dog.

“Most people came back with stuffed dogs, but Kappa Kappa
Gamma brought back a live one,” Oram said. ‘

Also on the list were as many bricks as possible. Some fraternities
now in the fraternity complex brought bricks from their old houses,
while others showed up with bricks from their current houses!

Each fraternity and sorority had to have cheerleaders at
Fun-n-Games, and the match group that won the cheerleading
contest consisted of: Pi Kappa Alpha, Lambda Chi Alpha and Alpha
Phi Alpha fraternities and Kappa Delta and Kappa Alpha Theta

sororities.

Other Fun-n-Games winners will be announded at the Greek Week

Formal this Saturday.

Also keeping up the spirit was Roy Rogers’ Greek Gorge, in which
fraternities and sororities were judged on how many roast-beef
sandwiches they could eat in the shortest period of time.

For the first time this event was held, the turn-out was large. _

“People were pretty excited about it,” said Oram, adding, “It takes
a special kind of person to wolf down all those roast beefs.”

Placing ‘among the fraternities in the Greek Gorge were: Phi
Gamma Delta —— first place; Phi Delta Theta —— second; Alpha Epsilon
Pi — third. The winning sororities were: ‘Delta Phi Epsilon —— first;
Kappa Delta —— second; Kappa Kappa Gamma —.third.

tine he performed last weekend
against Slippery Rock in getting an
8.7. Rovee commented that his dis-
mount made the difference this week
and that he “felt really hot.”

Junior Matt Peters finished first
for the Panthers on the high bar with
a 9.6. The routine included superb
originality. In combining his com-
plex moves with his one-hand
maneuvers (Peters was the only
gymnast to use them), his routine
would have produced higher scoring
results in most other gyms. Peters,
however, is not one to complain. .

“The way I look at it, ifI hit, I hit.

If I don’t, I don’t,” he said after the
meet. “I just try to do the best I can
and what I’m supposed to do — I
can’t ask any more of myself.”
' One major question about the
meet was the judging that Penn
State received. The “low” scores tell
it all —— 9.4 on floor, 9.35 on pommel
horse and 9.55 on vault,just to name
a few.

‘‘I would have to say that thejudg-
ing wasn’t quite in order,” Klafter
said. ‘‘It was expected because of
their home field advantage, but their
true test will be at nationals in an
impartial gym.”

Junior Marty Comini (8.80 on
floor, 8.50 on rings, 8.90 in vaulting)
disagreed. “This was a good meet to
end with,” Comini said. “I never like
to use poor judging as an excuse.”

Gym Notes: Freshman Jorge San-
chez’s 9.50 on floor led all Pitt gym-
nasts. His 50.75 all-around score
placed him ﬁfth in that category 
Sophomore Jim Gemelas competed
in spite of a neck injury sustained
last weekend on his high bar routine.
Gemelas had a respectable 8.50
-score on high bar at Penn State 
Mark Klafter finished the season
with an average score of 55.9 in the
all-around. This should qualify him
for nationals, which was his goal at
the beginning of the year. Klafter
made nationals last year on his floor
exercise and should find out about
this season’s results some time next
week  Joining Klafter will most
likely be Matt Peters. Peters also has
a shot at an all-around position at
the NCAAS. Peters qualified last
year on high bar.

GYM NOTES: The Penn State

,. women’s team finished at 13-6, while

the Lady Panthers close out their
regular season with an overall
record of 11-6  The two squads will
face each other again on March 30 at
the NCAA Northeast Regional
Championships held here at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

Gymnasts unable to dethrone State

Women lose” by 11,
Spector takes second  

By Jace Palmer

~ The Pitt News

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. —
The Pitt women’s gymnastics squad
fought a close battle this weekend,
ﬁnally bowing to Penn State by a
final score of 183.75-174.75 at
Recreation Hall. The meet was held
simultaneously with the men’s
competition.

Coach Donna Sanft felt that the
scoring was somewhat questionable.
“The scoring was a little weird,” she
commented. “I felt some of our per-
formances were ‘slightly over-
looked.” She said the three that
stood out most in her mind were the
uneven bars routines of Kim and
Jackie Calderone and the balance
beam effort of Brenda Frischmann.

In much the same fashion that
Terry Bartlett stood out for the Penn
State men, Pitt’s Alisa Spector did
the same for the Panther women.
Spector earned a 36.8 in the all-
around competition, good enough
for a second-place finish in this cate-
gory. This was Spector’s highest
showing ever in the all-around. Her
scoring included a 9.20 ‘on the vault,
8.90 on the uneven parallel bars,
9.25 on the balance beam and a 9.45
on the floor.

“I’m very happy with these scores
because it’s the best I’ve ever done,”
said Spector following her floor

exercise. “I did have a little trouble‘

with my mount on the uneven bars,

’ but I covered up pretty well. My

concentration helped me do this

because in gymnastics that's what
you have to do.”

Spector will again be seeking All-
East status, having placed second on
the floor and third in the all-around
at last year’s NCAA Regionals.

Freshman Beth Waters ﬁnished A

first for the Panthers and second
overall (behind the Lions’ Pam
Loree) with a strong effort of9.35 on

the uneven bars. Her other events‘

included a 8.65 on floor, 8.50 on
balance beam and an 8.60 on the
vault.

“I was pleased with the uneven
bars," Waters said. “I really wanted
to get the meet experience here at
Penn State. This will help out for
regionals because there you have to
hit your routines.”

Coach Sanft felt that the Lady
Panthers beam team performed
exceptionally well. Unlike many
other gyms, the balance beam at
Penn State is set up unusually close
to the crowd, and the crowd’s prox-
imity affects the gymnasts’ balance
and concentration. ”

In addition to Spector’s‘ 9.25,
other fine scores were turned in on
the beam by junior Kristy Pieters

‘(9.05), freshman Kim Calderone

(8.60) and freshman‘Cathy Coleman
(8.55).

Pieters, another of Pitt’s All-East
all-around competitors, received a
9.10 on ﬂoor and an 8.70 on vault at
Saturday evening’s meet.

“My ﬂoor exercise went fine,
except I thought my score might
have been a little higher,” she said. “I
did have trouble on the uneven bars
with myimount, but I made it any-
way. One thing that has improved is

my vault.”

Will Pens learn?

continued from page twenty

Fact: According to Cyndi Lauper, “Money Changes Everything.”

Fact: Mr. DeBartoIo’s fortunes have been estimated at over $500
million, so it might not change a thing.

Fact: The Penguins have lost in excess of $5.5 million last season
and what looks like $2 million more this season. (See above fact.)

Fact: It is just as" well known that while DeBartolo can deal with
losing money, he does notaccept losing games as graciously.

Fact: The sale of an NHL franchise must first be approved by a
party at the end of the season.

Fact: If the season ended today, the Penguins’ mailbox would
resemble a wind tunnel.

Fact: The Penguins reportedly have given the NHL office the
required one-year notice before they are eligible to consider a fran-
chise shift, and have done so for several seasons.

Fact: That “for several seasons” can be taken a lot of ways.

Fact: The Civic Arena Corporation’s lease with the Public Audito-
rium Authority is not as thorough as is thought. There is an “escape"
clause by which the franchise could leave town.

Fact: The date in that clause is June 1986.

Fact: DeBartolo and Ballard could certainly cover any losses
DeBartolo could suffer between now and then.

Fact: The sale of NHL franchise must first be approved by a
three-fourths majority of the league’s other 20 teams.

Fact: The owners of the other I3 American-based teams are reluc-
tant to lose another team to Canada. '

Fact: The last time it was attempted, by the Blues to move from St.
Louis to Saskatoon, it was vehemently protested. ,

Fact: Another requirement states that ifa franchise is not only to be
sold, but also moved (as is the case here), it must be approved by all
teams.

Fact: This is not likely to happen for many reasons, specifically
Canadian television revenues.

But now let’s examine what may be the most influential facts of all.

Fact: While it is true that everywhere you go, people are complain-
ing about the Penguins, that shows that they are interested.

Fact: That interest is obvious when one considers that the average
-4‘ attendance is up by 3,500.

Fact: The Penguins figure to lose “only” $2 million this season as
compared to last season’s $5.5 million.

Fact: The Penguins’ record, as dismal as it is, is above last season’s.

Fact: They have shown great potential, at times.

Fact: This team could be a team of the future. (This has been said
many times before.) 5

8)

'2

Fact: The interest in the Penguins shows that if this team were
successful, big bucks could be made in this city. This is a hockey town,
_ waiting for a contender. _

Ev The final faster is perhaps the biggest of all, but has been the most
overlooked.

Fact: No. 66 makes his home in the Steel Town. Money? Stardom?
A winning record? The potential is limitless. Would you sell a team
with the most exciting player to come into the league since Wayne
Gretzky?

By Mitch Vingle
For The Pitt News

Five University of Pittsburgh
swimmers will seek national recog-
nition at the NCAA Swimming
Championships, March 21-23, at the
University of Alabama.

Freshman Cindy Rose of Mon-
roevillc, Pa., sophomores Sue Hick-
man of Orlando, Fla., and Tracy
Pfister of Bethel Park, Pa., junior
Alicia Dugan of Pittsford, N.Y., and
senior Sue Heon of Clarks Summit,
Pa., all made national qualifying
cuts under Dave Belowich, the Big
East Coach of the Year, and are
determined to make their mark
against the nation’s top collegiate
competition.

The Lady Panthers ﬁnished the
season at 9-10 and went on to win
the Big East Championships for the
third consecutive season.

Along the way, Hickman, a grad-
uate of Colonial High, twice eclipsed
the NCAA qualifying time in the 50-
yard freestyle event. On Dec. 1, as a
member of a 200-meter freestyle
relay team at the Penn State Relays,
she beat the 23.79 cutoffpoint with a
time of 23.46 seconds. In the Big
East Championships, she did it
again. Before topping the field of61
in the finals, Hickman recorded a
preliminary swim of 23.16.

“Hickman is really starting to
sharpen up nicely,” said Belowich.
“She had a tremendous Big East
meet. As of Feb. 27, she was ranked
No. 2 in the country in the 50. That’s
nice, but it’s not new to her. Our

expectations are obviously high for
her.”

Heon may have even greater
expectations. An Olympian who
placed fourth in the 400-meter indi-
vidual medley at Los Angeles, Heon
struggled in the first part of the sea-
son but came on strong in the Big
East meet. She was named the
women’s outstanding swimmer after
winning the 500-yard freestyle, the
1,650-yard freestyle, the 200-yard
backstroke and the 400-yard indi:
vidual medley events. Heon quali-
tied for the NCAAs in three of the
four events. The Shaler High gradu-
ate swam a 4:53.27 in the 500 free-
style (the cutoff time was 4:53.69), a
16:31.78 in the 1,650 (cutoff time
was 16:51.09) and a 4:25.04 in the
400 IM (cutoff time was 4:26.19).

“Except for the NCAAs, the Big
East meet was the best champion-
ship ever for Heon,” said Belowich.
“It’s nice to see her swim so fast after
the career she’s had here.”

Heon is a three-time All-America:
at Pitt.

Pfister, a graduate of Bethel Park
High School, won Big East Cham-
pionships in the 200-yard individual
medley, the 100-yard backstroke
and the 200-yard freestyle, but she
found her way to the NCAAs as a
member of the 200-yard freestyle
relay team. Pfister will join Hick-
man, Dugan and Rose in the “Ala-
bama Chase.”

“Our preparation work is in its
sharpening stages as far as the relay

team goes,” said Belowich. “I can’t ’

predict how they will do, but I know
they will be going in prepared and
looking to score.”

Too tough

Will Pens learn tofly?

William Ballard and Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. are at opposite ends
of the spectrum. Whereas DeBartolo is known throughout the sport-
ing world, Ballard isa relative unknown. In fact, he is probably best
known merely for being the son of Toronto Maple Leafs owner
Harold Ballard. He is trying to change that, however, by attempting to
exchange places with DeBartolo as owner ofthe Pittsburgh Penguins.

Let's examine the situation. Exactly what will be the determining
factors? As Dragnet‘s Joe Friday would say, “Just the facts, please."

Fact: DeBartolo never made an offer or any announcement of
wanting to sell the team-

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa — In
Pittsburgh, one needn’t look far to
get a taste of sports entertainment. If
the Pitt Panthers sports teams fail to
suit your fancy, there's always the
Spirit, Penguins, Pirates or Steelers.
No matter how bad a season a Steel
City team is having they still manage
to draw the crowds.

At University Park, things don't
usually work out this way. If the
Nittany Lions football team’s season
is over, what else is there to do?
Move over, Joe Paterno; gymnastics
mania has hit Penn State. (Being
ranked No. 2 in the nation doesn’t
hurt either.)

On Saturday, the Pitt men’s team
(8-6) found out how good the Lions
(I I-1) actually were by suffering a
286.25—262._4 defeat in front of 5,000-
plus fans at Recreation Hall. This
was the Pitt men’s final meet.

The man in the limelight was
unquestionably Penn State’s Terry
Bartlett. Bartlett, a senior, was a
member of England’s Olympic
squad in Los Angeles last summer
and competed in his last meet as a
Nittany Lion. In compiling a 58.7
score in the all-around competition,
Bartlett produced his highest point
total ever. This score was also the
highest in NCAA competition this
year.

In bringing the crowd nearly to a
standing ovation in almost every
event, Bartlett used the fan’s pres-

ence to help better his efforts. In no

event was this more evident than in
the floor and high bar competition,
as Bartlett received near-perfect
scores of 9.9.

“I feel great right now,” Bartlett
said after the meet. “Pitt performed
very well. I have to put this out of my
mind, though, because nationals are

coming up and everybody‘s mind
has got to be geared that way.”

Although the atmosphere was
conducive to a good Penn State
style, the Panthers showed little sign
of being intimidated. Part ofthe rea-
son was the calm leadership ofjun-
ior All-East Mark Klafter.

“The results of this meet are a
reflection on our young squad,"
explained Klafter. “Some of the
guys did get caught up in the ‘Penn
State hoopla,’ but that was to be
expected  I found myself feeling
like a number in a crowd."

Klafter may have felt this‘, but he
certainly didn’t show it as he finished
an overall third in the all-around
with a 55.5-point total. Klafter set
the pace for the Panthers by leading
the team in four out of six events,
including the pommel horse (8.85),
rings (9.35), parallel bars (9.30), and
tied Pitt All-East counterpart Matt
Peters with a 9.30 in vaulting. Klaf-
ter’s 9.30 effort on the parallel bars
earned him a tie for third in the over-
all meet with Penn State’s Ian Shel-
ley. The Lions’ Bartlett and Spider
Maxwell finished first and second,
respectively.

The surprise of the evening was
Klafter’s relatively poor showing in
the floor exercise, by far his strong-
est event. In accumulating a 9.40,
Klafter failed to win the event for the
first time this season.

“I stepped up the difficulty in my
routine and I took the gamble," he
said. “My second pass worked but I
don’t think I had the endurance to
finish as strong as I would have
liked. I try not to pay attention to
other routines, but it’s hard not to
look at their scores. When Bartlett
got his 9.9, I knew it would be tough
 I guess you could say I expected
it.”

Sophomore Ben Rovee had Pitt’s
second best score on rings, obtaining

an 8.85 — his highest score ever in a

this event. Rovee used the same rou-

I said: “The first time

confident, but [Mau-

off. He was sort of a
laid—back wrestler; he
iwaited for me to
