*AEC’s Foremost Physicist     _,
' Developed Hydrogen Bomb ,

\ Dr. Edward Teller, formost nuclear physicist, will be "
speaker at Honors Convocation, Dr. Alan C. Rankin, assistant’-V
chancellor for student and general’ affairs recently announced. 
Dr. Teller, who has been referred to as “father of the .H—' 
bomb”, will address University Scholars, Honor Students, 
faculty, and the public at the April 3 recognition program".

I—Iungarian—born Dr. Teller feels
that the H—bomb was  creation
of many minds in addition to his.
With official scientiﬁc opinion op-
posing him on _both technical and
grounds, ,Teller swaged '
winning battle for the" original
I production of the hydrogen bomb.
Now that the bomb has been de-
veloped, he is waging a~battle for
its testing. To him, America’s_nu-
clear supremacy achieved through
testing has kept the post-war
peace: further testing is necessary
to keep this peace.

Bessie Smith’ Production Lacks, Realism

By KATHIE EDWARDS
Theatre l1’s production of
‘Edward Albee’s The Death of
Bessie Smith, last week, was
an excellent attempt to put
life and realism into the dis-
—-jointed and least forceful of
5‘Albee’s plays. Unfortunately, the
cast‘ never quite succeeded.
‘Albee’s initial _,idea developed
from the ugly circumstances sur-
rounding the death of Bessie
‘_Smith, a Negro jazz singer of the
,'1930’s. She was involved in an
auto accident and died in the car
after being refused admission or
aid at an all-white hospital near
.._Memphis, Tennessee. However,
.;the‘ author tried to pack too much
social commentary into a relative-
ly- short work, resulting in a
[rather directionlcss 47 minutes.
_ ‘ Eight Scenes
—. The play contains eight scenes,
,although several have little actual
connection with the main action.
_’In. the ‘middle of one scene in
;which two nurses in separate hos-
 pitals are chatting on the tele-
V , phone, music and the sound of a
crashing’ auto suddenly interject.
For several minutes the interrup-

    
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
   
  
 
  
 
  
   
     
   
    
       
    
  
  
  

then continue their aimless talk
"for a few seconds, and the scene
'. ends. -
_. ' The staging by Theatre’ 11,,
f .with eight scenes being per-,
. _formed on various sections of
-}_the L-shaped stage, was highly
commendable, but lacked a cer-
' tain amount of effect due to the
.limited space available. _
Theacting ‘was varied, ranging
from excellent to rather unrealis-
.tic and over-acted portrayals. Mrs.
Harriet Al1en’s performance as
i - the ‘ nurse ’ was extremely well-
-' done. In a difficult role, her real-
0‘: istic portrayal of the Southern
 white’s strong prejudice and un-
 realistic dreams for the future,
] .mingled‘with just enough typical
 Southern drawl, _added a great

Superb Performance
Ron Mitchell, who debuted as

ance. He brought an innate power
and depth to the four scenes in
which he appeared; he was com-
pletely believable. "

The orderly, portrayed by

of great depth of characteriza-

subject at hand,” he comment-
ed. He then expressed the de-
sire that a suitable agreement
could be reached between the
graduate students and the ad-

ministration regarding the de‘- _.

termination of the circumstances

and auspices mentioned in the «'

policy.

“Again, I feel a much more
liberalized course of action is in
order and certainly this area is
not in anyway burdened by the
complexities presented by Com-
monwealth law as are undergrad-
uates, many of whom have not
attained the age of 21,” Olofson
remarked.

Representative Step

Dave McGuire, past -president
of the Graduate Student Organi-
zation, said that the new policy “is
a representative step forward con-
sidering the past history of this
University, the state alcohol laws,
and thefact that there is a lot ‘of

‘ drinking in our society.

“It will be of little beneﬁt to

the individual graduate student '

’1

since most of themlive off cam-
pus anyway, but  might make
it possible for groups of grad-
uate students to have affairs on
campus 'where_li_quor is served.
Now we have: to rent. rooms
which costs a lot of money that
‘could be saved if the affair
could be held on campus.”

Mark Bebko, "president of Inter-
fraternity Council feels that “it
was the only’ step, the University
couldhave taken and it -is a more
lenient stand than in the past. It
will probably beneﬁt the graduate
students but I don’t see where A, it
will have that much effect on the
fraternities in general, except giv-.
ing men over 21 the right to drink
at house parties.”

No .Choice

Jim Edwards, Engineering sen-
ior stated, “I feel the University
had no other choice in what they‘
did. The SG proposal could very
well have ended up hurting many
groups that would not have been

allowed to drink since many stu-"

dents ‘are under 21. Also it might
have given these groups a poor
reputation.” _  .
.Olofson concluded his statement
by saying, “I would thils feel opti-

mistic for thefuture in regards to ,

‘of, work.

must now be carefully decided

Each student on the committee

will be responsible. for ‘recruit-T

“Therefore,” a d (1 e d Olofson,

A God Seeker

There are many ways of

A kibbutz, expounded Dr. Smith,
is a colective argricultural com-
munity. Jews throughout the
world live on the Israeli Kib-
butzim. S

Dr. Smith informed his audi-
ence that the kibbutzim are
democratica.lly- organized. He
stressed, though, that “there is
no drive to move up in elective
offices among the people. There
is no competition for power‘
positions, and very little search
for prestige. _

.‘‘Man is inclined to put his own
interests above those of other
men,” noted Dr. Smith. “The de-
gree of rivalry in our own land,
however, is not innate. Israel
suggests that the degree is amen-
able to cultural inﬂuence. There
the welfare of the community is
put above personal welfare.”

Cose to God

‘Dr. Smith added that, living in
Israel, the people feel very close
to God.

On this note, Dr. Smith went
on to speak about India. There

by Yoga with which one can
“swell to the size of the uni-
verse, or shrink to that of an
atom.” Yoga ultimately ends in
the union of man's spirit with
the Divine. A

Indians feel that man is a psy-

cho-physical complex. _“Yoga,”
according to Dr. Smith, “begins
with the body. A full course in
Yoga involves control of the or-
gans, then control of the mind,
and, ﬁnally, control 01' the spirit.”

Extraordinary Contortions
“It is extraordinary what one
can do with the body. Two Amer-
ican physiologists told me that,
in observing Yogi’s, they had
seen things done that they
wouldn’t have believed Could be
done if they hadn’t seen it.”
From here Dr. Smith took "his
listeners to Japan. “If this is
the sound of two hands clap-
ping, what is the sound of one
hand clapping?” he queried,
launching into a discussion of
Zen Buddhism and the Koans,
or tparadoxal questions, which
form the heart of Zen’s medita-
tive training.
Dr. Smith went into training
‘for Zen, but could not enter a
monastery because he “could not

duration required.” After prac-

weeks, he was able to maintain
the posture long enough to be ad-

last eight days of his stay in Ja-
pan. ,
' Freedom of Zen

“The freedom of Zen,” explained
D1‘; Smith, “comes after the or-
deal of training. By confronting
the mind with paradoxes, one at,
tempts to knock the rational mind
out of the picture for the time
being, therefore shifting the em-
phases to direct intuitive experi-
ence.”

 Night's Work

Instant Friends

By Vdiiay Jain--—

Instant tea, instant success, and now -—- instant‘
friends.

Writing papers and studying for. tests for the
next day is ‘par-t'of getting -an education at the
T .University_.’ For those who plan
ahead and do their work regu-
larly, it is easy to avoid last
minute pressures. Others, who
are not as well organized or who
are preparing for more than one

in other subjects has piled up in
the meanwhile and are thus
obliged to devote their sleeping
hours to catching up in the
courses they lag in.

Such all—night jaunts are in-
dulged in just before tests even by methodical
study" bugs. Thus, on any given night, when passing
through the campus, one will ‘notice study lamps

burning in several dormitory r‘ooms. However, not 

all students study in their own rooms. Some can’t

. do this because their room mates want to sleep at

night, while others ﬁnd it necessary to study with
fellow-sufferers and friends. Thus, these individuals
ﬂock to the dormilounges to pursue their quests

‘for higher knowledge and, more important, high

grades.
A deep sense of comradeship exists in the
lounge set, so it is the ideal breeding ground for

instant friends.

Settling or Slumping

Lighting up cigarettes or puffing on cigars with
their legs slung over a couch, they settle down
to an unpleasant but necessary task of reading
Russian or they slump ove‘r‘a typewriter, attempt-
ing to compose a paper on the problems of the
under-developed nations of the world. They break
their meditations from time to time‘ either to
stretch or to querry their companions or answer
their questions. Occassionally, they may run over
to Scotty’s for a cup of coffee. Some who cannot
study for long without a break saunter over to the
nearest student who is involved in solving a ther-
modynamics p‘roblem and inspect hisfailures with
amusement.

“Doing thermo, huh? Lucky I don’t have it. My
room mate is an engineer and he says it’s a rough
course to take. How are you making out in the
course?”

After resisting an urge to throttle the trouble-
maker, the young engineer lets out a grunt. ‘This, of

course, in interpreted by the first student" as an

invitation for further conversation. After an un-

successful attempt to ignore him, the engineer re— ‘

luctantly puts down his slide rule and looks up at
the intruder. This forced “study break” is most
often the start of a closefriendship. The next time
the engineer sees his new friend grappling with .a
Political Science paper. he will break in on him and

' return the compliment. And so on.

If, however, the engineer can bring himself not

to disturb the guy, then he will come over later ‘

and launch a second attack, and, this time, the
engineer will have to at ‘least look up and smile
for old times sake, and put aside his work.
Naturally, among the multitudes of the Univer-
sity community, there are a few silent types -who
cannot be drawn into a conversation no matter
how much effort is applied, while others resemble
the cannibal chief ‘who was deprived of dinner by
an unwanted missionary. They cast a freeze over

‘the uninvited visit_or’s words. These few souls are

lost, slaves to their work, and cannot be saved by
anyone.

Gain Friends. But . . .

The rest continueto do their work, or as much
of it as they can. They lose their “A’s”‘ and gain
friends. The friendships started in this mannerare
far more harmonious than those formed with class-
mates‘ because here there is no sense of competition
and each is expert in his own ﬁeld so that he is
not interrupted when.he is expounding on his favor-
itetopic for his companion.

Even those not of the studious type, or those
who have a single room where lessons may be
studied in solitude, can use the facade of working
in‘the lounge to strike up friendships. If the cam-
paign is launched during the freshman year, by
the time the ‘student graduates, he can have more
friends than he knows what to do with. The group
can be replenished annually by new students en-
tering the University and by newcomers to one’s
dorm and floor. A sure way to insure a constant
ﬂow of new friends is to get a new room in a dif-
ferent locale each trimester. So, the next time" you
feel lonely, go to the nearest study lounge —- there
are friends waiting for you. (Non-dormitory stu-
dents , can avail themselves, of this “pool” by-
-simply_ visiting a friend in the? d r )__ ‘

The announcement’ of the‘ administration’s ofﬁcial poli-
cies on the. major issues'of discrimination and alcohol" on
campus has drawn ‘considerable interest‘ in the commun-

ity; the interest in these’; areas caused the University‘ __to‘

ﬁnally make. -clear their“stands and they ,h_a‘v‘e,_obv_io‘usly

done so with ‘the knowledge that reactions would be varied-

and vigorous.

Having, set forth their stern stand against racial ,dis-'

crimination in any form for any who may have had doubts,

about i'ts‘att‘itude, ‘the administration ‘has found thattwo
areas are ‘of particular concern. »
Any fraternity or_so‘rority, to" begin with‘, which has

been bound to select its new members in‘,_a_ccord with re—

strictive "me'mbersh"'ip clauses!" in. its charter. or‘ ‘constitution
has ﬁnally beenordered to eliminate ‘such yrules in the“ near
future.‘ This inevitable ‘step, regardless of the discomfort it
may cause. for some, is‘ ‘most ‘welcome. "

Patronizing clubs which“practice discrimination, which‘

originally initiated discussion of the ‘problem sdme time
‘back in the .University Senate,’ was not, ’however, fully

4 covered‘  the recentvpolicy‘ statement. It‘ hoped that the
professors who brought this matter tothe ‘attention of the ,

Senate will soon berewarded with a satisfactory course of
action in this ‘area of the problem.

Having, clarified‘ the new alcohol s“t‘a‘nd in a letter to '

S_G‘President_ Tom,-Olofsion, Dr. Alan C.‘ Ran‘k'in_, assistant
chancellor for -student and general affairs,'has_ stated that
in addition t‘o"‘gradu.ate' students over thegage of 21,“ under-
graduates of thelegal age apparently will enjoy the drink-
ing privilege in the oﬁ’-campus‘ fraternity housesif the law
of the Commonwealth is respectedand i_f the owners or
governors of ’the houses concur with the new policy.
Considering this‘ stand a. highly liberal ‘one, Rankin

' has added" that the starting date for this "policy; has been

set for September in 'ord_er'to allow both the administration
and the students to adj‘ust_ to the new "arrangement, and to
carefully determ_in,e methods of ‘enforcing the rules.

In View of the admin‘istra_tor’s clariﬁcations, we hope
the University will not have‘difﬁculty in managing itsnew
rulings and that the ,students willabide by them. Many

.und‘ergraduates, particularly ‘those of legal drinking age,

- /

are not satisﬁed with the policy as ‘alcohol ‘has not‘ fully»

beenbrought to campus; but a stephas been taken and, if
.. the campus was dry before, it is now atlleast damp‘.

By HARRIET LEVINE
Last term, while doing a case
study of‘ the Nazi rise to power,
my political science professor
threw out a hypothetical ques-
tion: “What do you thinkwould
happen to American politics if
there was a depression here and
Mexico went Communist?”
I could almost hear the -cries

of the John Birchers and the»

Mccarthyites, but I wondered,
who would answer them. Cer-

tainly not the people I knew;-

they were far too rational for
that.

So I tucked the example away
to be used in “Quietness l.” It
was long forgotten. when my
friend’s father suggested we -go
with him to see a travel lec-
ture about Mexico. We agreed,
eager to reminisce about our ad-
ventures there last summer.

When the house lights came

back up. after the lecture, my

friend and I went backstage.
Our smiles were gone; we had
somequestions 7 to ask the‘lec-
turer. The man, had made in-
sinuations and I wanted to know
why he 'hadn’t forthrightly

-stated his opinions as such. ‘

Several? scenes had shown
Diego, Rivera murals in and
around Mexico City- and at the
national university. [The lecturer
proclaimed righteously that
these murals were not art, and
that Americans were being tak-
en in by the art critics. , ,

In one breath he asserted that
this work was not good; Diego
Rivera is a Communist. He pro-
ceeded to explain that the Mex-
icans were highly nationalistic
and that they were stressing the
work of muralists like_ Rivera
who, after all, is a Communist.

What’s more, the Mexicans
were even vilifying European
culture. His case in point was
a priest pointing a spear at an
Indian crouching near the
priest’s feet. The lecturer said,
“Look how Rivera (the Com-
munist) is depicting’ religion.”

VI-Ie claimed to have read
-widely about the Spanish econ-
quest and era, but seemed to
have come across nothing about
the ‘somewhat infamous role of
the Church.

Nor, apparently,‘ had the lec-

'turer been inside any of the

gilded cathedrals he had __been
showing photographs of.

If he had, he could see, even
today, the Indians crawling on
their hands and knees ‘down the
aisles to the white Christian
god the ‘Spaniards had super-

imposed upon the Indians’ own
superstitions.

Following .this were some
scenes of farmers washing a
cow, with comments by the lec-
turer on how theclndians were

‘ now tenant farmers for the state.

For the “uninformed” the lec-
turer ‘proffered that Mexico is

going socialistic, but he added’

insidiously that so are the rest
of us. A _

I. suppose that he was refer-
ring _to the collective farms
built around the common land
principle. of the Indian village.
But this was not all.

In case you had any doubts
about what the Mexican was
after when ‘it .came to the
of shots taken at Hilton ho-
American, there were a series
tels and luxury, night clubs,
comments about the mediocre

food one gets now" for four

dollars per person, and how the
cost of living was so high in
Mexico now that Americans
were escaping back to the Unit-
ed States. A

Finding the lecturer back-
stage, we asked quietly upon
what he based hiscriticism of
Rivera’s work. “Well,” the man
answered, “I’m a commercial
artist and Rivera-’s stuff is poor-

ly composed.” -

  
  
   
 

   
   
  
   
  
  
   
   
   

From “Spanish for the First Year," Mcmillan Co., New York, 1957 I
Diego Rivera’s “Fruits of Labor”

“Why,” we asked, “hadn’t you
mentioned this in your lecture?”
The inference had ‘..een, we felt,
that Rivera’s political views had
aﬁected the qualityof his work.

Again, deﬁantly, the man
snapped, “it’s, my opinion and a
man is entitled to his opinion.”

“Certainly,” I agreed, “but I
would think a man has a cer-
tain responsibility to make clear
his opinion and his basis for it,

.especially when he is talking r
before an organized lecture
group of professionals, busi-

nessmen, and housewives.”

Many of these people had and
will have little exposure to in-
formation on Mexico and I no
opportunity to see for them-
selves.

      
anal Mexico

We proceeded to ask him
what he thought about Orozco,

_a ‘Mexican muralist _of equal

fame as Rivera, but this com-
mercial artist had never heard
of the man.

Nor had he considered the im-
plication of the Mexicans’ stress
on indigenous art—tha" their
efforts to glorify the cultural
heritage and creativeness of the
Indian might be based on the
need to take the Mexican In-
dians from their cathedral dom-
inated local villages and wield
them into a nation that,‘ with
pride and vigor, could attempt
to compete in and contribute to
the ‘world and Western civili-
zation.

It was what the man said af-
ter the program that actually
frightened me. He told us that,
after forty-thrga years of travel-
ing, that is since he was seven,
he had been made into a cynic.

Strange, I thought, although
I was pick-pocketed _in Mexico
City, I came" away with the
memory‘ of the wonderful hos-
pitality of a Mexican family.
But then again I didn’t stay
at the Las Briaas Hilton for
$45 per day.

And I remembered what I,

had thought to be an oh so hy-
pothetical “What do you think

.would happen to American poli-

tics if there was _a depression
here and Mexico went Commu-
nist?” ‘

Barabra W. Tuchman’s rela-
tively new history The Guns
 August (Macmillan; 511
pages; $6.95) stands up as one
‘of the most literate and in-
‘I-formative pieces of non-ﬁc-

._t_i_on to‘ come out of the American
‘Ipress in many a long month.

.."Employing a dramatic rather
_than a merely historical approach
to ‘the momentous events of Au-
;gust. 1914 when the great nations
‘of Europe hopefully threw their
-?people into he bloodbath which
.;.was‘to bring a \"irt.ual end to
Europe’s age of Kings, Mrs. Tuch-
:man has religiously examined and
carefully evaiuated the states of
‘mind and changes in strategy of
_ the various General Staffs which
parented the series of blunders
leadingto the German clc.-feat on
‘the Marne. ‘

Destroys Myths

She has also managed to de-
. stroy’ some of the long standing
~ i myths concerning the German in-
wjyasion of Belgium and France.
' “The Belgian defense of Liege did
no‘ delay ‘the German advance for
two weeks as most schoolboys
 believe from their ninth grade
’ histor_y, nor did the British save
th: world by their gallant del'ense
or Mons and their spirited coun-
terattack at the Marne—a false-
7hood which the British have man-
aged. to conceal for almost half a
century.
In ‘act. as. Mrs. Tuchman
' - brilliantly points out. the rapid
fall of the Belgian citadel came
‘as a general shock to the French
high command which had ex-
‘ pected it to hold out for months,
and the famed British counter-
attack was virtua_ll,v forced upon
a reluctant French General who
"wanted to retreat beyond the_
Seine and leave Paris to the
_ Germans.
But it is in her evaluation of
those events which» l‘oretold of
his hideous trench warfare which
was to en;:ue for tour long years
after the stzmdup ‘battle on the
Marne that the author. really
-shows her insight.

It \vas not the German assaults
which-1'oreed the French to re-
:— treat on Paris. Instead, it came as
a result of French repulses along
the frontier when they tried to
pit men against machine guns in
a valliant if toolhardy attempt to
-regain Alsace-Lorraine.

Also, the attack at the Marne
was not an attack but a last
ditch stand before I"aris. The
attack did not develop until the
Germans bent themselves silliy
against the British and French
armies which ringed their
ﬂanks. ,

These instances of defense tak-
ing the upper hand over the at-
tack were only to be the first such
instances in a long series of de-
fensive victories which would
continue until new tactics were
-developed to return the ‘attack to
its rightful placein the realm of

strategy.

the department since 1946, is re-
placing Dr. Frank as chairman.

Dr. Frank resigned from his

' duties so that ‘re could spend

more time in research and teach-
ing. He has been named Adjunct
Fellow at Mellon Institute."

His research or}. the structure
of water and of aqueous solu-
tions has been underwritten by
grants _from the National Science
Foundation. Dr. Frank’s work has

disclosed that water changes in
structure when substances are
dissolved in it. This causes the
dissolved substances to react dif-
ferently in water than in other
solvents. This work is applicable
in protein study and scientists

are studying the properities of -

protein that are dependent on
water. _
Dr. Frank came to the Univer-

sity from Lingnan University in 
Canton, China. Here he has V‘

served as consultant on several
projects concerning the countries
of Ecuador and Formos... Dr.
Frank was chairman of the de-
partment since 1951.

Curfew Hours Extended

Housing Board has passed a back to the University by 10:30

resolution allowing women resi-
dents of the University dormi-
tories to have two 12:30 a.m.
permissions on Sunday nights per
trimester.

Previously women were per-
mitted to take a 12:30 a.m. on
Sunday night only when they
forfeited one of their two al-
loted 2:30 a.m. permissions.

Ann Walesky, chairman of
Housing Board, said, “We decided
to give the. special 12:30 a.m.
permissions because of the dis-
tance that some women live from
the University. In order to get

NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP gymnas-
tics will be decided at Fitzgerald
Field House on March 29-30.

  

p.m. Sunday night some women
had to leave home early in the
morning.” '

Miss Walesky also added,
“These permissions may also be

used if a woman wants to at-

tend an event in Pittsburgh on
a Sunday night. With these
special permissions women will
not have to forfeit their 2:30 a.m..
permissions.”

A GAMBLE THAT PAID OFF

The large, upraised hands of Paul Krieger have become a.
status, symbol in a newly-awakened basketball-conscious
world at Pitt. ‘

In that characteristic pose, knees bent, arms outstretched
as if _he were begging for admission, this’ haggard young man
has snared 213 rebounds in 20 games. .~’

He has also scored 191 points, but his pride lies in his
. »  _ . -  it   ' board-clearing prowess.
Happy Days

:_"{ cent for days because of his
unforgettable play. in last
Wednesday’s" golden triumph
‘over West Virginia. His team-
mates carried him off the
Mountaineer Fieldhouse ﬂoor
that night.

, , The Panthers were giving
away two-and-a-half inches
per man, yet they outrebound-
ed West Virginia, 55-40. Tom

taineer center, had a two-
inch edge; on Krieger, yet
;Pau_l outrebounded him 15-7.

Itwas‘ Krieger who got
the ball forithe Panthers
when they needed it most
and. it was he who sank
two free throws with 13
seconds left ‘to push his
team ahead, 69-68 ’— the
ﬁnal count.

.. Physically not construct-

Poul Krieger Goes Up , the full 40 minutes —— the
only men who did -— and they were productive minutes. He
had scored 17 points beside his 15-rebounds. ~

“He’s the most valuable player on the team,”. said Frank
Power, Boston College coach, earlier in the season. Power
had seen Krieger twice in the Steel Bowl ‘tourney. He had
only scored 16 points in two nights, but he had snatched 25
rebounds. “He gets the ball and gets the attack going,” said
Power. ‘

Ichabod Crane’: Image . —

Being strong anywhere, especially under the boards amid
heavier players, is novel to‘ the 180-poulnder from Union-
town High School. When he ﬁrst came here the only thing
outstanding about him was his Adam’s apple. He still looks
like a fossil of Ichabod Crane. ‘

His transformation ‘from a blustering, blundering fresh-
man is as drastic as the difference between the varsity’s 12-11
record that year and the present 16-4 report.

In high school, Krieger was the sixth manion both
units in a" two-platoon system. “Ten guys might get in the
4 game before I did,” Krieger recalled.

Coach BobMTimmon's was hot in pursuit of a Uniontown
regular named Joe Andrews who was 6-foot 7. Toward the
close ofthe recruiting season, Timmons was talking with
Uniontown coach Abe Everhart, who told him that Andrews
had decided on Penn. . 1 V

T_im_mons‘was‘ miffed and he sta_r.ed- anxiously around the
gymnasium. His eyes soon were ﬁxed on a scrawny, orange-
haired youngster practicing the high» jump. ,

Krieger could clear, six feet and his high‘ springing

motion interested Timmons. “Whei-e’s he going?” Tim-
, mons asked desperately. b

Everhart said _Kri_eger' had been offered a partial .scholar-
ship_to small Bethany College. “Think he’d be interested in
going to Pitt?”, Timmons inquired. A

“He sure would!” Everhart exclaimed. Timmons later
confessed, “I was just so hard up’ for a big man I had to take
the gamble.” , _

It paidioff. -Joe Andrews is not even on the traveling
team at Penn these days. ‘

_The only ~trave'ling_ team’ that Krieger had made before

he came here was with the”Uniontown ‘High hand when they.

The successful work of the Panther basketball team
could be rewarded today by a phone call to Athletic Director

Frank Carver. Today is the day that the. first bids

NCAA tournament are given.

to the

After his team’s 76-54 win over»Bucknellon Saturday,
Coach Bob’ Timmons said, “Chances are that we might be
invited to both the NCAA and the: '

NIT tournaments.

“The NCAA gets first prefer-
ence and they come outwith
their bids first. The -NIT_usually
waits until the third week in
February before they send out any
offers.”

Let's Go Somewhere

Timmons continued, “I. don’t
really mind where we get invited,
as long as we go somewhere. I
know they choose, four indepen-
dent teams east of the Mississippi.
Two of them play Mid-East and
two play East.

V “Loyola. and NYIJ look like
probable teams. The others
might be Miami of Florida, Holy
Cross, Providence, Penn State
or us. If we don’t hear today,
-the committee might be waiting
until we play Penn State next
week.”-

The Panthers had little trouble
with Bucknell. With Dave Roman
hitting seven of his first eight
shots, the Panthers grabbed a 45-
26 'half—time lead. Roman, ,who
usually‘ does most of his scoring in
the second half, led all scorers
with 19 points.

I-Maryland turned out to be
too much. for the Panther
swimming team to handle
last-Wednesday, beating them
53-42 and breaking their skein
of consecutive victories at
seven.

“Our swimmers gave us every-
thing I asked for and a little bit
more, but it still wasn’t enough,”
said Coach Ben Grady.

“Several of our swimmers
swam the best times they’ve
swum all year—free stylers Torn
Ribarchak, Rick Petterseon, and
Rob Levine, and backstrokers
Jerry Sollinger and Wayne Pap-
pert,” he added .

Sets Standard

Rob Levine set. a University
record of 5:23.? in the 500—yard
free style, bringing down his own
time of 5231.0 which he swam
this year. Raoul Rebil-
lard of Maryland posted a pool
and varsity record of 1252.6 in
the 200-yard free style. Levine
and Rebillard were only an
arm’s length away from each
other at the end of both of these
events.

“Roman has been one of our most
consistent performers ‘all ,season.
He has been our top scorer in
three of the last four games.

“Both he and ‘Paul Krieger

wins over West Virginia and
_Bucknell. Krieger got 15 re-
bounds against. those 6-foot 8
boys at Morgantown and 14

-Iféhigh Decides to Cancel Future I I
Frosh Mat “Matches With Panthers

Lehigh will not continue to
schedule wrestling ‘matches be-
tween its freshman team and the

-Panther frosh “in the foresee-

able future,” it was announced
by Lehigh athletic director Wil-
liam B. Leckonby.

“Pitt’s evident inability to ful- ‘

ﬁll scheduled committmentsﬁ ‘for
its freshman wrestlers,” was "the

reason for- the "severance of re-‘

lations,‘ according to Leckonby.
Last year the Panthers had only

 

three frosh wrestlers eligible, so
the match was cancelled. This
year, with only ﬁve frosh on the
team, a mixture of freshmen and

THE» CURSE or THE CAMPUS: No. 2

As was pointed out last week,

one would think that with all

the progress we have made in the education gaine, something

might have been done by now about roommates. But no. The
roommate picture has not brightened one bit since Ethan

Goodpimple founded the ﬁrst American college. ' ‘ ‘
(C.‘ontra.ry to.popula.r belief, Harvard was not the first. Mr.
‘Goodpimple‘st‘a.rted his institution some 75 years earlier. And

quite an _institLItion it was, let me tell you! "Mr. Goodpimple ~
built schools of liberal arts, ﬁne arts, dentistry, andtanning.

He built a lacrosse stadium that seated 102,000. Everywhere

.v on campus was emblazoned the stirring Latin motto CA V E S

. M U SSI —‘‘Watch out for mogse.” The student union contained '
a. bowling alley, a. clock, and a 16-chairbarber shop.

. (It was this last feature-_—-the barber shop.--that, alas,

’ - brought  Goodpimple’s collgige to an early end. The student
body, being drawn from the nearby countryside, was composed '
chieﬂy of Pequots and Iroquois who, alas, had no need of a.

_ barber shop. They braid their hair instead of cutting it, and as
for shaving, they don’t. The barber, Tremblatt Follicle by name,
grew’ so depressed staring all the timeati 16 empty chairs that

one day’ his mind ﬁnally gave way. Seizing his vibrator, he ran

' outside and shook the entire campus till it crumbled to dust.
This later became known as Pickett’s Charge.)

But I digress. We were discussingways for you and your
roommate to stop hating each other. This is admittedly, diffi-
cult but not impossible if you will both bend a bit, give a little.

I remember,-for example, my own college days (Berlitz, ’08).

, My roommate was, I think you will allow, even less agreeable
than most. He’ was a. Tibetan named Ringading whose native
customs, while indisputably colorful, were not entirely endear- E ‘
ing, Markyou, I didn’t mind so much the gong he struck on
thehour or the string of firecrackers he set off on the half-hour.

I didn't even mind his singeing chicken feathers‘every'duskeand

daylneak. What I did mind was that hesinged them in my hat.

To be fair, he was not totally taken with some of my habits
.either—-especially my hobby of collecting Water. I had no jars
at the time and just had to stack the water any-old-where.

Well sir, things grew steadily cooler between Ringading and '
me, and they might have gotten actually ugly had we not each ‘ I
happened to receive a package from home one day. Ringading
opened__his package, paused, smiled shyly at me, and offered

me :1 gift.

“Thank y’ou,"’.I said. “What is it?” ' a - .
Yak butter,” he said. “You put" it in your hair.‘ In. Tibetan

“Dr anything else you could name,” I said,‘ lighting my own
