" Provost reflects on black culture

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

The audience was on its feet
when Dr. Donald Henderson,
university provost, finished his
lecture commemorating Martin
Luther King Jr.

“He gave a real life account of
what it’s like to be black and he
didn’t sugar coat it. The fact is
that people need to know what is
going on,” said Lisa Smith, Pitt
Law School student.

Henderson’s lecture, “Cultural
Differences and Education” was
held in the Teplitz Memorial room
at Pitt Law School last Friday.

“The thing that King was trying
to do was, in a simple way, to
make this society of ours more
hospitable to blacks. He yearned
for a time in America when all of
God’s children would be free at
last. We have made great strides
but we have not reached what
King called ‘the promised land,’ “
Henderson said.

Henderson began his lecture
by examining the status of blacks
throughout American history.

“The abolitionists can be called
the earliest civil rights workers in

America. The institution of slavery -

was destructive and

Student Government Board
members are joining other Pitt
students in urging university
officials to reverse the decision to
hold graduation ceremonies on a
Saturday this year.

“We do understand the many
different components and that
no matter what day the
ceremonies are held, there will
be some sort of conﬂict. We ask

dehumanizing. Their task was

the hardest because they had to

establish that slaves were actually
human beings,” he said.

Henderson said that society
continued to be inhospitable to
blacks even after emancipation

“It was against the law to accord
blacks the same rights that whites
just took for granted. Imagine
that,” Henderson said.

Henderson’s grandfather was
born during the decade of the
emancipation and the provost
related a story showing the
attitude toward blacks in the South
at that time.

“My grandfather’s cousin saved
enough money to move his family
to the North,” Henderson said.
“While they were waiting at the
train station a few white men
approached them and said ‘Your
wife‘ is a fine looking woman. We
are going to have her for a few
minutes but we will get her back
in time for the train.

“His cousin was outraged but
his wife said ‘If you protest we
will both be killed. It is better for
me to go along than for us to get
hurt’ and went along with the
white men.”

Henderson said that a different
kind of hostility towards blacks is

the university to find a day that
will accommodate the greatest
number of students,” President
Julie Shepard said during the first
open‘ meeting of the 1990 SGB
on Thursday night.

In the past few weeks, many
Jewish students have complained
to university ofﬁcials because the
Saturday graduation date
interferes with the Jewish Sabbath
day when some Jews cannot ride
in vehicles. Members of the Black
Action Society are also upset

~ still prevalent in our society today.

“There is deﬁnitely a cultural
inhospitality towards blacks now.
The ethnicity of blacks has been
almost completely ignored,” he
said.

Henderson said that some black
customs can cause problems for
children who are entering school.

“B1ack children are taught to
not look people in the eye when
they speak to them, especially if
it is someone they owe reverence
to. They learn to express their
interest by talking and moving.
Then they walk into a school and
they are told to shut up and be
quiet. This causes a lot of
problems," Henderson said.

“‘Free at last’ includes the
possibility of being what you are
and being accepted both by
people who are like you and
who aren’t.”

Jeana Bryant, Pitt Law school
student said that Henderson’s
speech was very appropriate for
the period that blacks are going
through right now.

“I liked what he said because it
was on target and was really
about the things that blacks have
to go through. He is letting people
know that it just isn't right,” she
said.

with the change since their annual
senior banquet is scheduled for
that Saturday.

The date is also the last day of
university ﬁnal examinations,
causing a conﬂict for some
seniors.

Nancy White, assistant to Pitt
President Wesley Posvar, said that
the reason the date was tentatively
changed from Sunday, April 29 to
Saturday, April 28, is because the

However, board members and
Leon Morris, a religious studies

meeting, agree that the university
should go to all lengths to avoid
student inconveniences and keep

“The university has admitted

said.

In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, being caught driving
under the inﬂuence of alcohol will, by state law, result in a 48-hour
jail term and. a $300 fine. And this penalty is for a first offense.

This figure was part of the information made available during
Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority’s Drunk Driving Awareness Day held
on Friday at the William Pitt Union Concourse booth.

“The responsibilities of drinking and driving are just too great,"
said Sandra Sanders, member of AKA’s Drunk Driving Awareness

THE PI'I'1‘ NEWS, Monday, January 22, 1990

By Maria Perez
Staff Writer

Nearly 50 people gathered in front of
the William Pitt Union on Friday to
march for housing rights for the homeless.

The march, sponsored by the Student
Action Union, Pittsburgh Housing Now
Coalition and the Community for
Creative Non—Violence, ended at the
Federal Building downtown.

“This is a statement of solidarity, that,
as children of Pittsburgh, we're
acknowledging that there’s a problem
our city has to address, that they must
take notice of it,” said Bruce Arrigo, an
organizer from Pittsburgh Housing Now.
“We’re also acknowledging that there
are very concrete things the city can do."

“Jim,” who has been homeless for
three years but is attending Allegheny
County College “to better himself,” said
he thought the march was needed to
make people aware of homelessness.
“The government needs to find homes
for the homeless and [to] educate

[homeless] children better.”

The shanty that was on the union
lawn all last week was taken down
before the march. This year, the food
and clothing collected was not as much
as past years, but the goal this yeanwas
not to obtain temporary relief of
homelessness, but to raise
consciousness and ask the government
for more permanent, long—term
solutions to homelessness, according
to Arrigo.

At 1:30 p.m. the marchers started out
on Forbes Avenue. The increased
consciousness the marchers were
aiming for began with chanting and
passing out ﬂyers. Chanting phrases
like “What do we want? Housing. When
do we want it? Now." and “Wake up
America: Homelessness sucks,” the
group turned onto Craft Avenue and
then onto Fifth Avenue, which would
take them downtown. A police officer
on a motorcycle followed the crowd
all the way down Fifth Avenue.

motorcycle. Accepting one of the roses
worn by the marchers, the officer tucked
it under his badge on the front of his
uniform, smiling.

“Just doing my job,” Pittsburgh Police
officer jack O'Rourke said.

“House the people, not the bomb,"
reverberated in the streets near the
Jubilee Kitchen, a poverty-stricken area
close to the Strip District.

Some merchants, shoppers.and bar
customers along the stretch left
businesses to stand in doorways,
supporting the marchers with cheers
and accepting the Pittsburgh Housing
Now leaﬂets handed to them.

Other onlookers had reservations
about the demonstration, concerned
that the marchers would be arrested.
“That's the Man’s [police] territory, that
building right down there," warned
one onlooker, gesturing toward the
Federal Building.

“Two, four, six, eight; keep them off
the subway grate,” shouted the

See Housing, page 12

A sea of wide-eyed nine—to-ﬁvers
parted on downtown sidewalks,
allowing passage to shouting housing
advocates as they completed the last leg
of their march from Oakland.

“People were made to sleep indoors,
not on grates and subway floors,” yelled
the demonstrators, some trailing blankets
which were wrapped around them to
fend off last Friday’s bitter cold.

The five-mile march, which began at
the William Pitt Union, ended a week-
long rally sponsored by the Student
Action Union to bring attention to
homelessness. Howard Brown,
Pittsburgh Housing Now organizer, lived
in a plywood shanty along with others
on the WPU lawn for five nights as part
of the demonstration. '

The marchers walked toward the
Federal Building to encourage support
for federal housing funds for Pittsburgh,

Byjacinta Marie Dvorak
For The Pitt News

The Office of Disabled
Student Services offers more
services than just the shuttle for
physically handicapped
students. There are other
services being offered by this
office that many Pitt students
are unaware of.

The office provides
interpreters for deaf students
and readers for the visually
impaired. Also available are
Braille materials and books for

leaming-disabled students.

‘We have alternative testing.
We can record an exam on tape
for a student, and then they can
record their answer, " said Sabina
Bilder, student servioe specialist
who heads the Office of
Veterans and Disabled Student
Services.

The office has been working
with Generations Together, a
volunteer group sponsored by
the university.

“We have been trying to set
up some volunteer tutoring,"

said Bilder. “A retired engineer
is going to be tutoring a blind
student. We don't have a
tutoring service, but we just try
and [tutor] when we can.

“The campus shuttle is not
new,” said Bilder. "The service
has been around for about 10
years. The only difference is
that the shuttle was painted
blue and gold."

“This term we have about
five people that have 9 a.m.
classes. That means that some

and bumper stickers, each with a
message about the responsible
use of alcohol.

“A lot of people that came by
were older people,” said Lisa
Washington, who was helping to
run the booth. “I think they’re
taking [our message] seriously.
It's a serious matter. A lot of
people are surprised that a drink
this good does not have any
alcohol in it,” she said.

“It has a little ‘kick’,” said Lisa
Harris, another Drunk Driving
Committee member. “You can
get fruit juices and soda water at
bars,” said Harris, an employee
of Zelda's. “Some people who
are worried about peer pressure
could order a non—alcoholic
spritzer, and no one will know.”

Koster sees a relationship
between drunk driving and
underage drinking.

“I think drinkers are more likely
to drink, and they’re more likely
to overdrink if they’re not
experienced drivers and
drinkers,” she said.

“There's a lot of people who
don't realize the consequences
of underage drinking,” saidjessica
Becker, a freshman visiting the
booth. “They don't realize that
the bars and [fraternity and
sorority] houses [they were at]-

According to a Pennsylvania

pamphlet, adults who buy alcohol
for underage drinkers will receive
a $1,000 fine for the first offense.

The board also approved the

all students and would provide
information on a variety of
subjects pertaining to the Pitt

March

Continued from page 3

Halfway through Soho, the
group gained about 30 more
supporters,’ including a few
people from the Hill District’s
Jubilee Kitchen.

Political recognition of
homelessness was also sought by
the marchers, many of whom
sought support for the T wo—Cents—
More Campaign.

The Two-Cents-More
Campaign, which requires people

, to sign cards that will be sent to

federal representatives, asks for
more assistance and subsidies for
those who cannot afford housing.

Those who participated in the
march were also asked for their
signatures on a petition
supporting the Mickey Leland bill.
The bill recognizes the “need and
the right to fair housing,”Arrigo
said.

Arrigo also said he hoped the
march would “ignite the ﬂame

that existed” at the rally in

“We hope that the energy we
wanted to see in this city — the
energy that would speak to the
children of the City of Pittsburgh,
acknowledging that their fellow
citizens, the least of them, are out
there living in the streets or in
unimaginable. conditions —— will
snowball so we can, in our city,
represent ourselves at the national
winter campaign and spend a
few days or longer in Washington,
D.C., as a city in unison with the
national movement,”Arrigo said.

The national movement is

calling people to sleep out in
Washington, D.C. between the
end of December and April 15.

According to Arrigo, the
homeless includes “people who
are living in doubled—up
apartments, in abandoned
buildings, under bridges, in
deserted alleyways, people in
shelters, people in single
occupancies, and people on a
very small, ﬁxed income.

“That’s the kind of deﬁnition of

homelessness we have to
acknowledge if we are going to
own and accept that this is
something that can affect any
one of us, that what we’re really
asking people is to acknowledge
that this is something that can
affect any one of us,”Arrigo said.
“It is scary, and we don't want
them to take on themselves, the
government or whoever. This is a
partnership. We need to
acknowledge it’s a partnership

and we can end [homelessness] if

we work together on it.”

Martin serves seven
blocked shots in Pitt
victory over Pirates

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

Pitt’s 65-63 victory over Seton Hall on Saturday was a defensive
struggle. Therefore, the sellout crowd of 6,798 in Fitzgerald ,Field
House only had about ﬁve reasons to shake the rafters:

0 Pitt ﬁnally won a Big East match—up, making the team 1-4.

0 Seton Hall's opportunity to tie or win the game with 10 seconds
remaining.

- Bobby Martin’s seven blocked shots.

0 Quality playing time from freshman Brian Brush.

0 The Pitt cheerleaders’ lively halftime show.

To excel defensively the Panthers got a little out of character and
used the full—court press more than they have been. .

“We pressed fairly well and have been working on it fairly well, bu
with six kids you can't use it very often,” said Pitt Coach Paul Evans.
“We went in thinking we’d use it the last four minutes of the first half
 then come out the second half and use it only on dead balls and
save it for the end again. It gave us a big lift  It’s a good thing because
you don’t win many games shooting 40 percent."

With 12 seconds remaining and the game tied at 63, Brian Shorter
took a dish-off pass from a driving Darelle Porter and laid the ball up.
The ball bounced on the rim for a short time and dropped in. With
a two-point lead and 10 seconds remaining, the Panther’s full-court
press worked its magic. P

Seton Hall inbounded the ball to freshman guard Marco Lokar, but
the Pitt defense only allowed the ball to barely make it over the half-
court line. Porter stripped the ball and threw it high in the air to kill
the last two seconds, making Pitt 1-4 in the Big East (6-9 overall). Seton
Hall now has the same Big East record, but are 8-7 overall.

“You focus on the last two plays of the game and say that’s where
we lost it,” said Seton Hall Coach P.J. Carlesimo. “But we turned the
ball over too much and didn’t finish the plays inside. I don’t think you
lose games in the last.two plays."

Reserve forward Brian Brush knocks the ball away from a Setonﬂall opponent and Brian Shorter gets the loose ball.

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

It’s a good thing Brian Brush
didn’t accept that basketball
scholarship to the University of
Vermont. If he had, he never
would have gotten the chance to
play Big East basketball. He never
would have been able to provide
a spark for an ailing Pitt Panther
basketball team. And he never
would have had the chance to
play a key instrumental role in the
Panthers’ first Big East victory this
season: a 65-63 victory over Seton
Hall.

Brush entered the game in place

I of Darren Morningstar in order to

provide “somebody fresh off the
bench.” He wound up with five
points, one rebound and an assist.

But far more important than
these small numbers were the
way and the success with which
he ﬁlled his position, or positions,
in the 20 minutes of action he saw
off the bench.

“When I come in, it allows
Bobby [Martin] and Brian [Shorter]
to do different things. Sometimes
we all rotate at fulﬁlling different
roles underneath. When I come
in, I know I'm not going to dazzle

See Brush, page 8

anybodyout there with my natural
ability,” Brush said “I just try to
play within the system and hustle
out there and do the things that
we need to do to win.”

With 3:40 to go in the first half, '

Brush hit a turnaround jumper
underneath the hoop at a difficult
angle, and the crowd erupted as
the unlikely freshman pulled the
Panthers back to within six points.

Pitt. was down by 10 with less
than five minutes to go in the first
half. Enter Brush. Pitt down by
only two at the end of the first
half.

Brush’s heroics carried over
into the second half, as he started
and played 16 minutes. His
unwillingness to be intimidated
by any one of the members of last

     
    
   
     
   
   
   

year’s national championship
ﬁnal team was evinced late in
the game.

At 4:19, Bmsh went up for a
shot over'6-foot-8 Pirate senior
Franz Volcy, who knocked the
attempt right back in Brush’s
face. Brush retrieved the rejection
and tried it again. No luck. Same
result Only this time, Brush drew
the key foul, Volcy’s sixth, which
sent him to the bench and
enabled Brush to convert one of
two from the free-throw line.

With Volcy out of the game,
Brush single-handedly
eliminated the Big East's top-
percentage ﬁeld shooter, a player
who has scored in double figures
in every game except two, and a
player who could certainly do
some damage down the home

stretch in any game.

Playing at the collegiate level
in Division I is a far cry from
Brush’s previous experience only
last year as a member of
Sharpsville High School’s team.

Cause for intimidation? No way.

“My job is to be aggressive. If
I'm not aggressive, there’s no
sense in me being out there. I
don’t care who I’m playing

' against. If it’s an All~American or

any player, I have to play my

game,” Brush said.

Brush, at 6-5, 223 pounds, plays
a much quicker game inside than
Darren Morningstar, and his
quickness certainly helped out
on defense when the Panthers
needed it.

Panther bench Brush proved that
he can contribute off the bench
in more ways than simply scoring.
His success has varying
undertones for the future of the
Panthers.

Pitt's full-court press was very
successful, especially in the latter
moments against Seton Hall,
because most of the players were
rested due to the substitutions of
Brush and Cavanaugh. No
tongues were dragging on the
ﬂoor this game.

The implications of this success
are many, and it will remain to be
seen how the Panthers will use
their substitutes in the future.
Because one day in the sun for
the bench and Brush could mean
better weather ahead.

The major reason the Pirates
were unable to convert on plays
inside was Bobby Martin. Martin
tied a Pitt record by blocking
seven shots, many of which lead
to Pitt fast break points.

“If we get the ball inside the
way we did, we have to get more
from it than that We got a lot of
shots blocked by our big people.
When we do that to other people,
we say it’s good defense, so that
was good defense by Pittsburgh,”
said Carlesirno.

Martin's performance didn’t
really surprise Evans, however.
Seton Hall's “big men” don’t really
compare to a Georgetown or a
Syracuse inside game, according
to Evans.

“I think one thing is that they’re
mostly 6-8 kids instead of 6-10 or
6-11,” said Evans. “But he’s
realized with six fouls to give, he
can go after more of those shots.”

But Martin said Pirate forwards
Anthony Avent, Michael Cooper
and Frantz Volcy are probably
the strongest guys he’ll have to
play against in the Big East this
season. ‘

Martin finished the game» with
13 points and 13 rebounds. Jason
Matthews quietly lead Pitt with
19 points, including hitting four
of seven three-point attempts.
Shorter added 17, including 1 1 in
the second half. The versatile
Porter had seven points, eight
assists, seven rebounds and three .
steals, including the one that
sealed the Panther win.

Brush, who has seen very
limited time this year, scored five
points in his 20 minutes of playing

time. Starting center Darren

Morningstar played just nine
minutes. ‘

Pitt was’ down by 10 points
when Brush entered play in the
first half. But'Shorter scored six
points in the last ﬁve minutes of

v the half, and Seton Hall held a

slim 33-31 advantage at
intermission. Pitt took over the
lead with 15:39 remaining in the
game and never fell behind again.
The scrappy. Seton Hall team
wouldn’t let the lead get over six
points and tied the score three
times, including Avent’s bank-in
with 52 seconds left setting up
the Porter-to—Shorter game
winner.

Pitt lady swimmers
defeat West Virginia

By Jim lakely
Staff Writer

The women's swimming and diving team travelled down to
West Virginia University on Saturday and came out with an
impressive 136-107 victory.

As usual, the Lady Panthers started with a strong performance
by the diving team, led by Nicole Bunker. She won the 1 meter
and 3 meter events with scores of 299.60 and 276.00 respectively.
She hit every dive almost perfectly, described as "the best I’ve
ever done.” by Bunker. “More important than winning both
events was the way I dove, it really built my conﬁdence", she
said. The conﬁdence she will carry with her makes her a diver
to watch in the Big East Championships.

Melida Hennon qualiﬁed for the NCAA dual, and Eastern
meet competition on the 1 meter board. Sasha Miller placed 2nd
on the 3 meter board.

“The divers did a great job and gave us an edge", said coach
David Belowich. An edge that they carried into their first event.
The Lady Panthers scored ﬁrst in the 400 yard medley relay.
Trina Thames, Laura—Lee Sullivan, Julie Rocks, and Celeste
Makiel posted a winning time of 401.98. The victory was
assured injulie Rock's leg when she put it away. Pitt also placed

Men avoid letdown aﬁer PSU win

By Adam Kamras
Staff Writer

One of the toughest things in
sports is to guard against a
letdown after a big win. Coming
off the dramatic victory against
Penn State, the Pit: men's
swimming team got right back
up for West Virginia with a 148-
92 win.

“If we laid down for this meet
after Penn State, we could’ve
lost, ” said Coach Dick Bradshaw.

The Panthers showed they
were ready when they came out
and won the ﬁrst six events,
starting with the 400—yard medley
relay team of Mike and Joe
Kozlina, Matt Weist and Bill
Folger.

a victory in the 1,000 freestyle.
Schepner was pleased with his
team's readiness. ‘After a big win
like Penn State, it’s hard to get up
again,‘ he said.

Joe Kozlina picked up his
second victory of the day in the
200 free. He was also a member
of the ﬁnal 400 relay team with
Eric Cornell, Matt Porter and Tim
Adams.

Adams was another Panther
with three victories. In addition
to the relay, he won the 50- and
100-free events. He felt everybody
was ready for the meet “I was
surprised,” he said. “A lot of
people even swam better than
[against] Penn State.”

Adams credits much of his
success to his having tough
competition forcing him to be at

his best.

Eric Mattson was a two-time
winner,. taking the 200 individual
medley and the 200—breaststroke
events. John Sharkey won both
the 1- and 3-meter diving events

Mike Kozlina won the 200
backstroke by almost ﬁve
seconds. “There's no backstroker
in the East with his talent," said
Bradshaw.

After beating state rival Penn
State last week, eastern rival West
Virginia this week, the Panthers
will end their regular season this
Saturday when they host Big East
rival Villanova. The meet is
scheduled for 4 p.m. at Trees
Pool. Last year Pitt defeated the

Pitt opens EWL season with loss Swim

By Chris Kuzneski
Staff Writer

Pitt opened its Eastern
Wrestling League schedule against
Lock Haven on Saturday night
and was soundly defeated by the
Bald Eagles, 26-9.

The Panthers, now 3-3 (0-1 in
the EWL) for the season, had few
bright spots in a match that Pitt
Coach Rande Stottlemyer called
“very disappointing.”

The lone Panther winners were
Bob Simpson (126 pounds), Alan

‘ Utter (142) and freshman Sean

KI! \I/ \II
'«t~”«t~*'«t~‘5I(I CLUB

Gibbs (167).

Simpson provided the most
dramatic win of the evening in
his match against the Eagles’ Dan
Smith. The score was tied at 3
when Simpson was awarded one
point for an escape with two
seconds remaining, giving
Simpson the win at 4-3. The
victory pushed Simpson's record
to an impressive 20-8.

“Simpson really did the best
job of the night because Bobby
had lost to this guy before,” said
Stottlemyer, referring to an early
season match. “It’s always nice to

avenge an earlier defeat.”

As for the rest of the meet, there
was little drama. The Panthers
lost ﬁve major decisions (a loss of
more than seven points) and were
easily outdistanced by the
experienced Eagle squad. ‘

“Lock Haven has a real good
team, a strong group of guys,”
said Stottlemyer. “The difference
is [that] our guys don’t have the
experience. On paper we were
only favored in a few matches,
but I thought we would hang in
there better. I think we can put up
a better effort than we did.”

3rd in the event with Janine
Atiyeh, Debbie Bardzil, Kara
Moxie, and Noelle Barry at
415.84.

The Mountaineers didn't put
up much of a ﬁght, so coach
David Belowich was able to
shake his line-up a bit last
weekend. Many of the swimmers
competed in events that they
normally don’t race in. Clare
Mcshane won the 1000 free
(1037.24) and the 100 free (54.30)
and feat that shows her versatilty.
A swimmer towin both a distance
event and a sprint event in the
same meet is a rarity. Liz Sari,
who made Eastern cuts, finished
3rd (1042.29).

Theresa Picklo, and Crit
Gallagher ﬁnished 1st and 2nd in
the 200 freestyle with times of
157.18 and 159.51. “Both can
swim the event, but they don’t
do it too often.” “They did a fine
job.”, said Belowich.

In the 50 freestyle, Sandy
Albright took 2nd place (25.70),
Kirstie Beltz took 3rd (25.73) and
Terri Ziegler finished 4th (25.76).

In perhaps the most demanding
of all events, the 400 Indiviual

Medley, Karin Masal finished 2nd .

with a time of 442.02.

Julie Rocks won the 200
butterﬂy by pulling away at the

marchers, getting louder as they
approached the downtown
business district. The police escort
stopped trafﬁc so that the
demonstrators, waving signs and
banners, could cross the busy

streets.

When the group ﬁnally reached
the Federal Building, they were
informed that Mitch Snyder, a
national housing advocate
expected to arrive from
Washington, would be late. An
hour later, the crowd seemed to
be maintaining high spirits as
folk music was played on a guitar.

A high school student waited
for Snyder to arrive. “It was a long
walk; it was rather cold” said
Lindsay Long of Greater Works
Academy. She was optimistic
about the outcome of the rally.

“Hopefully this will change the
minds of the people upstairs,”

Long said, gesturing to the offices ,

inside. “It will make them really
think about it.”

When Snyder arrived without a
coat, he wrapped himself in a
blanket like others had, after

refusing several offers for warmer I

clothing.

“I am here to be supportive of
people who have done a very
good job over the past six
months," Snyder, of the
