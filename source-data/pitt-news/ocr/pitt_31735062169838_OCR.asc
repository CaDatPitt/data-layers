Zord Seeks Stick To Stymie Student Stir

(See editorial on Page 4.)

Representative Joseph V. Zord (Rep.-
Allegheny County) told The Pitt News
in a telephone interview yesterday that
he had- introduced a bill in the State
House of Representatives last week at-
tempting to curb violent student dem-
onstrations at state or state-related in-
stitutions of higher learning.

The bill calls for the immediate dis-
missal of any students participating in

the occupation of buildings, disruption ’

of classes. or interference with faculty.
The penalty for the failure of any
school to comply with the proposed leg-
islation would be the immediate term-
ination of state funds.

According to Representative Zord,
the rescinding of financial aid would be
used as “a club to hold over their heads.”
The cut-back on funds would last “until '

 

/‘

°’.<

uwivgasirrl
r S :2 s

the regulation is complied with.”

The bill has about 18 co-sponsors.
according to the congressman, and is
presently in committee. Zord feels that
chances for the passing of the proposal
are “very good." '

Zord mentioned “the disruption of
education all around the United States”
as the reason for his bill. “To my mind
it’s criminal," he asserted. “My con-

 
   

 

cern is with the non-violent student who
must live in fear of the others.” Repre-
sentative Zord views his proposal as an
attempt to temper student unrest.

This legislation, however, “has noth-

ing to do with peaceful demands,” Zord

emphasized.
Representative Zord also mentioned-

a possible merger of his bill with a sim- '

ilar one previously proposed by State
Senator Robert Fleming.

A group of about 800 students
and spectators gathered in the
Commons Room at noon Friday to
discuss several demands on Uni-
versity ‘policies.

The demands were:

—The end of all censorship. direct
and indirect, and that Universi-
ty printing facilities be made
available to all recognized Uni-
versity publications.

—That the Dec. 4 decision of the
faculty concerning removal of
ROTC be upheld, and that no
modifications of this decision
be made without the consent of
the faculty.

—That the administration take a

public stand against the propos-

al of Senator Fleming and any
similar legislation which would
result in the suppression of bas-
ic civil rights: specifically free-
dom of speech andright to as-
sembly: that Fleming, as a trus-
tee of the University, abandon
any plan for introducing legis-
lative bills designed to limit the
freedom of the members of the
University community.

’ —That the University unequivocal-

ly and publicly expose and op-
pose the presence of student in-
formers on campus.

—That the Dean of Students Of-
fice cease the practice of keep-
ing secret and unauthorized per-
sonnel files on nearly all under-
graduate girls.

—That the faculty and teaching
fellows beallowed to freely
discard the grading system at
their discretion.

Baum Ap-peased;
Files to be Burned

SG President Scott Baum and Dean of Students Ron-
ald Pease reached an agreement Friday to destroy the Res-
idence Assistant (RA) Files located on the 12th floor. The
forms will be destroyed in the presence of Baum.

The mentor and RA forms have been filed on the 12th
floor for years. The files concern family relationships, dat-
ing habits, personal appearance, and political activities of

campus co-eds.

The RA forms were filled out at the end of each term
by the mentors. This activity, according to Baum, will
cease. No agreement, however, was reached on the confi-
dential files kept on all students on the 12th floor. There

. will be more negotiation in this area. .'

  

 

 

are elements not conducive to
learning, said, “Students,»..have a
right and duty to demand an en-
vironment proper to learning.”

In response to the recent BAS
demonstrations, Robert Kohl, a
senior, feels that he cannot con-
done their Gestapo-tactics. He
disliked a group of students, un-
invited and in uniform dress,
marching into classrooms and de-
manding the cancellation of class-
es in commemoration of Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King’s birthday.

Bill Hank, a student, said that
he was totally confused over the
ROTC issue because he feels the
administration keeps stating, con-

tradicting, and restating decisions

on the ROTC matter. He wishes
that the administration would
‘make a final conclusive statement ‘
on the policies of accreditation for .
ROTC.

Feeling that the Alternatives
matter was mishandled, Dave Ros-
enblum, writer for The Pitt News,
said that if‘ Mr. Beers conscien-
tiously objected to printing the
fourth issue of Alternatives then
Beers should have been excused
from work that day. Rosenblum
further pointed out that military
functions do not cease because of
conscientious objectors.

Chancellor Posvar addressed
the group for 45 minutes, answer'-
ing student questions on different
issues.

Posvar dismissed the ROTC is-
sue saying, “There has been a
complicated series of events con-
cerning ROTC—and there ‘is no point
in discussing hem here.,.because .

f of thscoinplications.” V -~.. -

plans'“'to:do7so in the future_.-_.- =  -’=

 

  
  

In reference to Alternatives," I 
Posvar commented that any stu- 

dent publications should be finan-

cially. independent so that it is 5.
able to go-' to af”-publisher outside 
the University. ' V. ».-31,;

A‘ student asked what was go- ' I 

ing to be done about the personal
files kept on girls. Posvar answer-

ed, “I do not know anything about_ I 

these files. The idea of them also
offends me. I have been told that
such files are not kept but there

is a problem of semantics. I sim- 

ply do not know.”

Posvar also added that he knew f

of no FBI informers on campus.
“I know of no such penetration
and I do not favor any sugchpene-.
tration,” he said, stating that the
head of the local FBI called his
office and said that there is no
such informer at the University.

One student mentioned that

nothing was being accomplished. J‘)
at the meeting because the Chan- ‘ ’  '

cellor would not give any con-
crete answers to the problems.

She asked Posvar if more violent  I

methods were necessary for re-
sults.

“I have attempted to answer I

questions to the best of my abil-
ity,” Posvar said, emphasizing that
violent and physical interferences.
with the functioning of the Uni-

versity are definitely unaccept- ,

able.

Posvar stressed that he feels it

is necessary for him to hold more   .;._
‘meetings with students ,-and he has

Bear Rocks
Scene For

‘Ski -Day’

On Sunday the Student Union
Board will present the second in-
stallment of its Winter Sports
Days. The first was the Skating
Party at the Civic Arena Feb. 2.
The second will be a Ski Day at
Bear Rocks Ski Resort. Bear Rocks
was chosen this year because of
its more realistic prices for stu-
dents and its proximity to Pitts-
burgh, enabling skiers to spend
more time on the slopes.

There are two'types of tickets
available for Ski Day at the Un-
ion Information Center. The sin-
gle admission ticket at $2.50 en-
titles the purchaser to entry to the
ski area and a lift ticket. This
ticket is best suited to the veter-
an skier who brings his own
equipment. The lift and rental
ticket at $5.50 entitles the pur-
chaser to the same things as the
single admission ticket plus ren-
tal of equipment. This plan is for
the novice. Buses will be pro-
vided as needed at $1 per person
round trip from the Student Un-
ion to Bear Rocks and tickets for_
them are available at the Union
Information Center as well. It is
suggested, however. that those
persons who desire to remain at
the slopes for the evening bring
their own cars as the buses will
be leaving Bear Rocks for the re-
turn trip at 6 p.m.

‘Business’ Theme For Seminar

The second in a series of Ca-
reer Seminars will take place
Tuesday and will bring to the
campus exemplars from business.
industry and communications.
From noon until 4 p.m. in the
Student Union Ballroom students
will have an opportunity to meet
successful men and women rep-
resenting a variety of professions
in these fields.

Today, business had an ever
growing need for educated young
men and women to assume re-
sponsibilities as managers. and to
later assume high positions in cor-
porations or as heads of their own
companies.

Business and economic activ-
ities are an important part of
modern life. A proper study of
these human activities must be
concerned with the values usual-

' ly ascribed to a liberal arts edu-

cation and to professional train-
ing. Graduate education provides
a study of detailed techniques
which can later be applied when
working for specific industries
and companies.

Open discussions with the rep-
resentatives of business will pro-
vide the student with some know-
ledge of what would be expected
of him should he consider busi-
ness for his career immediately

following completion of. his un-

dergraduate education or after
post-baccalaureate study.

Such people as Mrs. Marvba
Benton, systems engineer for
IBM; Miss Mary Kennedy, Per-
sonnel Department, Kaufmann’s;
Robert Ziegler of United States
Steel, are just a few. of the peo-

ple who will be here to talk with‘

students.

Communications include radio,

cations research, and information
retrieval is another professional
area that can be explored. Vic
Miles, news broadcaster for
KDKA-TV, Channel 2; Herb
Stein, journalist and research as-
sociate to the Chancellor; Wil-
liam Hanks, broadcasting, Speech
Department, as well as represen-
tatives from our own Graduate
School of Library and Informa-
tion Sciences will exemplify pro-

communications.

  Fairy A Big Stick

 

Legislation geared to hold a club

 _over the head of the University was in-
' ‘ _ troduced last week to the Pennyslvania

House of Representatives by Joseph V.
Zord (R.-Allegheny County). The ill-

 _g -conceived bill is now in committee.

The bill was introduced to elimin-
ate disruptive campus demonstrations.
Rep. Zord’s masterpiece of logic calls

 for the immediate dismissal of any stu-

dents participating in the occupation

 of buildings, disruption of classes, or

interference with faculty.

If the administration fails to com-
ply with the dictates of the bill by not

‘3 ﬂexpelling any student engaged in vio-
, _ lent disruptive activity, the institution ..
I.” will lose its State aid. The fund cut-
. ‘ back, according to Rep. Zord, would
 “only last as long as a respective ad-

ministration failed to comply with the
provisions of the law. “Its the only
way we can stop these demonstra-

P ltions,” said the Allegheny County Re-
.f.pubhcan.

The most unfortunate aspect of the

 — Zord bill is that it has some chance of

becoming law. Mr. Zord told The Pitt

I News that his bill has about 18 co-
il’. . sponsors in the House. The State Rep-
" resentative indicated that he may com-
5 ,_ bine his bill with Sen. Fleming’s pro-

posal to create one solid legislative

 ' package.

.This is another serious blow to this

- institution’s fight for autonomy. Like

Sen. Fleming, Mr. Zord has no con-
ception of the ideals of the academic
community. He has no idea that an

 .institution’s excellence withers away
' with its autonomy.

Sen. Fleming and Rep. Zord have

l~ no business sticking their ignorant
V . noses into University affairs. This in-
. stitution has every right to handle and

  The Way 1 See It 

 

judge its own disciplnary cases.

Above all, Rep. Zord, in the name
of decency and fair play, would casti-
gate one of the East’s finest universi-
ties by threatening to withhold State
funds. This perspicacious act holds a
financial club over the administra-
tion’s head.

What Mr. Zord and Mr. Fleming
fail to realize is that the students and
faculty of this institution are commit-
ted to the continued excellence and-

, autonomy of the University. What Mr.

Zord fails to realize is that his dema-
goguery has no place in State politics.
And the State Legislature has no right
to interfere with the internal affairs
of the University of Pittsburgh.

The issue of University autonomy’

has reached a critical point. Unlike
the statements of many students, fac-
ulty and administrators, Zord feels his
bill-has a good chance to pass. We are
indeed in a perilous position.

We ask the students who want this
institution to remain autonomous to pe-
tition the Governor and the State Leg-
islature protesting the Fleming-Zord
attempt to usurp University authority.
This may help the situation “in Harris-
burg.

On the other,hand, if the whimsi-
cal notions of the Pennsylvania State
Legislature prevail creating a state
law concerning the discipline of stu-
dents at State-operated and state-relat-
ed universitites, the time for mobiliza-
tion has come. -

If the Flemingxor Zord bill becomes
law, its time for the students, faculty,
and administration of this academic
community to pick up picket signs and
protest. »

lane highway, he knew it was one of those
things you\just do . . . “To do,” he barked
aloud.

Janey stirred, and snuggled up against
Tom’s leg. He put hand on her cheek.

“SO MANY PEOPLE are essentially
mad to condemn themselves forever to a
methodic way of living,“ he thought.
changing the radio station to WABC New
York. “They always deny themselves the
liberty and freedom of life.

"Everyone always tries to keep a
schedule. Kids say they have to go to
their classes, they have to study . .- . go to
classes, study. . .- . It’s ridiculous. They
never try to live.

"Girls plan dates weeks ahead of time.
Guys work all week on a date for Satur-
day night. And then usually they do the
same thing, week after week after week.

 

 

 

"They never experiment. They never
follow impulsive whims. They're either
afraid of something. or else, they excuse
themselves. saying they’d like to but they
have something to do. They live from week
to week. leaving Saturday night as the
only day to free themselves."

WITH HIS EYES groping for the white
lines of the road, Tom was becoming
sleepy; and decided to pull over at a rest
stop and sleep for the night.

When he and Janey awoke the next
morning. they stopped for breakfast and
hit the road once again.

Janey looked at her watch. “Eleven-
thirty,” she said.

“Hey I should be in English class.
I’ll have a out against me," Tom chuckled,
laughing at society. “This is like running
away from home. It's like saying the heck
with everything. and just taking-off.”

“You know Janey, we're doing some-
thing that I’ll betcha a whole lot of other
kids want to do down deep inside. but nev-
er do it," Tom inserted. "It’s just a love
of freedom and new places that makes us
go.

“JUST THE CHANGE means so much,
because when you get back to what you
left. everything is put into a better pers-
pective. Life seems a little better, a little
freer.

"When you do get back, it makes you
feel better about your responsibilities to
others. You see them in a clearer light.
When you go off to new adventures, you
grow in yourself. You’re a better person
for your friends and relatives. Everything
is better."

For Tom, everything was better. He
had jumped out of the mainstream of life
and made himself the target of fate.

He and Janey always had good times
together, but this time would be the best.
They knew it.

Janey rubbed the back of Tom’s neck,
and he turned to see her smiling. Neither
of them saw the oncoming car.

by DAVE TIERNAN
Staff News Editor

The following letter was written

not only to my teacher, but to all

students, faculty, and administra-
tors at the University.

Dear German Teacher.
I have been sitting here in the

” Pitt News office since 3 p.m. yes-

terday memorizing words like
“gesellschaftsfahig,” “Wirkscha-
ftsfeindlichkeit,” and “Scheiben-
waschanglagen” for the test we
will have later on today‘.

‘ Now, I would like to ask you in
all sincerity if you could look at

’ those words at the beginning of
..this note and tell me if you feel

that if I memorize them (and
about 300 more like them) and re-
gurgitate them on a piece of pa-
per in the proper word order, that

 that is_:
 .—A. A true indication of how

well I understand German?
. —B. Any indication of how well

I-' A , you, as a teacher, have conveyed
-. _'interesting and valuable informa-
  '__tion to your students? T

 f_" ‘—-C. By any means a valuable
" .;_part.‘of a true Liberal Arts-‘Edu-

cation, which the administration
feels is the main reason for a two
year language requirement‘?

In case you haven’t heard about
me through the grapevine, heregis
a brief history: I spent 27 months
in Germany while stationed in the
Air Force, and I acquired a de-
cent working vocabulary of the
spoken language. I completed
German I and II, here. with a B
in I and a C in II. I am now tak-
ing German ,II for the third time
and have every intention of pass-
ing and getting"German IV out of
the way and removing that damn-
able milestone from my academ-
ic neck.

I am, however, a very outspok-
en critic of the language require-
ment and will be until I leave the
University. It is an archaic form
of a liberal education, which is
typical of this University.

The main reason other students
don‘t write letters like this in the
middle of the morning is because
they are for the most part young-
er, and therefore content to do
whatever the administration tells

them‘ that they must do to obtain _
a degree. I don't care that much

about a degree. I want to learn as
much as I can about myself and
society in which I live before I
take my place in that society.

We are living in an age where
the Black man has finally crawl-
ed out from under the heavy foot
ofthe white middle class—in an age
where students are following that
example and crawlingout from
under the foot of an ancient sys-
tem of mass education in the mul-
ti-universities of America..

Someday I hope to be a journal-

ist. Do you think that by memoriz- _

ing those words and regurgitating
them on a piece of paper I will be
a better writer? Are you aware of
the fact that this school offers
only one course in journalism? In
order for those of us who want to
pursue a career in journalism to
receive any kind of an education
here. we must work for a publica-
tion in our spare time and hope
that we learn something from
each other that will help us in the
future.

By now you are probably ask-
ing the same two questions that
the others here always ask: V

_1. If you don‘t like the language

requirement and the fact that Pitt
offers no journalism courses, why

~ the hell don't you get out?

2. Why don’t you just study and
pass German III and IV, and be
done with it?

Well, I've thought about both
sides. But, evidently. those per-
sons in the past who were in my
position did either one of the
above—and for that reason. there
is still a language requirement
and there is still only one journa-
lism course here. Well. I may end
up leaving. But I have an ideal-
istic feeling that those of us who
attempt to make others aware of
the fact that there are certain
problems at the University are of
vital importance to our fellow stu-
dents.

Some time when you walk into
class. look at those kids sitting
there. Some of them are very
young. Many of them have yet to
have the pleasure of sitting in
French 181 and having Rabbi Ru-
benstein tell them that God is
dead. and that to attain freedom.
man must free himself from the
secure grip of parents, religion
and social myths. T I '

They have noidea who they are.
or what they are, or what a true
education is.

They have no idea of what
Black Power means. or what Stu-
dent Power means, or who Jean
Paul Sartre is, or who Huey New-
ton is, or who Wesley Posvar is.

Many of them are probably en-
joying a deep. sound sleep right
now. knowing that they memor-
ized those 300’ or so words and
feeling very confident that they
wilt be able to regurgitate them
on the test today. '

But, it seems that I have an-
other test that I" have to worry‘
about today. And tomorrow, and
the next day, and next month. and
next year.

I can’t help but feel that if. they
were all as old as I am, and as
concerned with the state of at’-
fairs in this school and this coun-
try as I am, that many of them
would be sitting at-their typewrit-
ers as I am. You see. most of the
concerned students here are jun-

iors and seniors who have fulfill-

ed the language requirement and

(Continued on Page 5)

 

That Book Has Me ‘Hooked on A Feeling

/Continued from Page 4)

can only question it in retrospect.
But question it they do.

Every time I look at that Ger-
man book, I have to question its
worth to me and to my education.
I look at that book and think of
all the Black History books and
all the Psychology books and all
the novels and all the philosophy
books and all the Ramparts mag-
azines and all the other literature
I could spend time with and I
have to question not only that
book, but what that book repre-
sénts.

Somehow I feel that that book
‘represents very much to me.
Somehow I feel that that book
represents all the problems here
at the University, all the problems
in society, and all of the problems

in the world. What that book rep— - .

resents is a basic lack of commun-
ication between student and
teacher; an acceptance of the stat-
us quo; a prostitution of one’s free
will; the archaic way in which
education has become nothing
more than many students facing
many teachers. and administrators
who are busy building more grad-
uate school facilities and writing
letters to politicians and alumni
explaining that somehow they will
quell the murmurings of a few
radical students who are tyring to
rock the smooth-sailing boat of
the multi-universiyy.

By now you are probably say-
ing that there is something dras-
tically wrong with me—for many
other studentsover the years have
struggled throughfour semesters
of German, and they didn't ques-
tion its value to their education.

Well, my answer to that is that
a lot of students have passed
through this, and many other uni-
versitites without questioning too
damn much. And those same stu-
dents have moved on to be teach-
ers. and businessmen, and doctors.
and lawyers, and citizens with-
out questioning too damn much.

What the hell do they care
about ghettos, and rats, and all
those other things that don’t af-
fect them?

And what the hell do they care
-about Vietnam? They don‘t have
to go over there and fight, do
they‘? You see. every time I look
at that German book, all these
things come into my mind. I am
not saying that I don’t question
other aspects of this University»-
no. It’s just that at this point in
time, that book represents all the
things I have told you about.

There is a good chance that if I

memorize those words and get out’

of German, someday I’ll forget all
about _that book and what it rep—
resents to me today. But, I doubt
it.

Do you think ghetto-dwellers

ever forget what a rat represents.g

even when (and if) they move out
of the Ghettos? And, do you think
a GI ever forgets what a gun rep—
resents, even years after he has
put it down for the last time? Do
you think Jewish people forget
what gas chambers represent.
even those who merely read about
them in history books?

A Jewish friend'of mine told
me thatl will never know what
it is like to be in his position, for
I have never been persecuted for
being born into a minority group.
A Black friend of mine told me
that I couldn’t really help the
Black movement, because I’m not
Black, and I just don’t understand.

Well, when I look at that Ger-
man book. I have some idea of
what they are talking bout.

Most of my friends can’t help
me because they just shake their

heads and say, “What'are you go- .

 

ing to do. you can’t graduate with-
out German.” And you and my
other teachers can’t help me, be‘-
cause, as the computer in the
Dean’s office tells me, “It’s in
the catalogue that every student
must fulfill the language require-
ment,” and teachers must do what
they are told to do; after all, it is
in the catalogue.

My teacher last term tried to
help me. After I told him part of
what I am telling you, he advised
me to withdraw and try again next

term. He gave me a withdrawing-
grade on my grade slip and the
Dean’s office changed it to an
“F” because it says in the cata-
logue that every student must ful-
fill the language requirement,
and may only withdraw for health
reasons.

Well, sir, the sun is coming up
and I had better get back to those
words. You know what? Right
now, as I look out the windows of
this office, I see the cars begin-
ning to roll down Fifth Avenue.

 Reader Supports Halliday

 Editor, The Pitt News:

May I write in unasked for
support of David Halliday and his
pragmatic solution?

How insipid this must seem in

I. numbers, percentages and, expec-
' ially, ideas to the professor who

lived through the days when Pitt
was 20 to 25 per cent in““Pink—
cells” — or infavor of less violent
revolutions — and the country got
“redder” as one went East! Those
were real days when white (and

~mostly Catholic) unions took-over

Detroit and made us like it; when

x  our own three river valleys echo-

ed with the victories of those for-
eigners in the CIO.

Editor, The Pitt News:

-EI read with great relish the in-

"' terview of Professor Myron Tau-

be which appeared in the Jan-

. “nary 31 issue. I am aghast, how-
" . ever, by the good professor’s opin-

ion of science and the‘ content of
science courses. To take the view
that small classes in the sciences

‘ ' - are unnecessary because there are

no nuances of ideas is pure poppy-
cock. His must be the myopic of
science courses involving the rote
memorization of facts and prin-

 -I v . ciples — the least scientific aspect

of science. Good science teach-
ing should instill in the student
the desire to search for truth, to
always question and examine old

 I and new ideas and myths; it in-

stills the abilities and joys of
‘substantive deductive reason-

! ing. It teaches not only the an-

swers, but why the questions must
be asked. It is these nuances that
are difficult to convey in large
classes; yet it is these aspects

' _which, can be retained long after
 the facts and principles are for-
gotten and which are so import-

ant if we are to have the moral

Finally, one detectsa feeling,

on behalf of Professor Taube
because of a society, which for

Editor, The Pitt News:

Many thanks to you and Mr.
Levenson for~bringing to every-
one’s attention the deplorable
tactics of the F.B.I. in hiring stu-
dents as spies. I agree entirely
with your editorial that this prac-
tice must be stopped. It could only
be justified as a temporary meas-
ure to combat a very grave and
immediate threat to national se-
curity. Perhaps the F.B.I. thinks
of draft resistance and pot-inhala-
tion as qualifying, but I am
sure the majority of us do not. We
deem the adverse effects of such
police state tactics on university
freedom of much greater weight
than the questionable benefits of
incarcerating people who detest
killing and removing from a drug-
ridden society the one narcotic

nobody has proved has any very _

dangerous effects.

Peace Corps Curbs

by SANDY DEVIRGILIO
Staff News Writer

“I am more and more convin-
ced that we are the same.”

For Mr. Hamil Lee. one of three
host country nationals who will be
speaking with prospective Peace
Corps volunteers this week, the
Peace Corps has destroyed a part
of America’s unfavorable image
in Korea.

Lee and his wife Mihae, both
affiliated with Peace Corps oper-
ations in their native country, con-
sider the volunteers the fourth
“type” of American in Korea.

American soldiers, the first
group, were “not liked” because
of their sometimes irresponsible
behavior when on leave.

The next “type” to enter Korea
failed to dispell the natural re-

sentrunent caused by" a foreign

army.

The diplomats who, to some
extent, replaced the army, pro-
jected an image that was “too

sweet.” Koreans distrusted the
constant optimism of these
people.

A more recent group, American
tourists and businessmen only
the pleasant surface life of Korea.
They make no effort to under-
stand the real situation of the
country or its people.

Letters to the ‘How, our read-
ers see it’ department must car-
ry the full name of the writer
and the signee.’s school or ad-
dress: Letters should be type-
written, triple-spaced, and 200
words or less.

All lettersare subject to con-
densation and editing by the
editors. E

 

 

Bad Image Abroad

The Peace Corps volunteers,
on the other hand, live and work
with Korean families. Lee be-
lieves that mutual understand-
ing occurs when people “share
living,” and he stresses the word
“mutual.” The Peace Corps en-
ables Americans to see -the Kor-
ean people without the backdrop
of the Korean War.

Although Lee considers the
Peace Corps workers “young Am-
ericans before I think of them as
English teachers or health work-
ers,” he commends the function-
al operations of the organization.
Koreans consider English an
international language, and find
the audio—lingua1 methods intro-
duced by the Corps effective in
teaching that language.

Of the 270 Peace Corps volun-
teers who have been in Korea.
only about 90 worked for the
health centers. These people acted
as health advisors and nursery
staff members in rural areas. The
majority of volunteers in Korea
have been associated with teach-
ing.

“I like the term ‘volunteer’
To the Lees, this word means
that the Peace Corps members
are in Korea because they want
to learn about themselves as well
as about a new country and cul-
ture. These mixed motives benefit
both the voluneeer and the coun-
try.

Mr. ‘ and Mrs. Lee, Ayden
Comelek. a host national from
Turkey, Rob Sellin. a Corps
volunteer from Chile. and Donna
Smith, a volunteer from Som-
-alia, will be availabel to speak
to students each day this week.

cent of this total. According to
statistics, he now receives 90 per
cent. In fact, the increase was
much less. For example, one-half
of the 22 per cent increase is for
shelter and fuel. For a family of
four. this means a maximum in-
crease of $21 a month. an increase
that will not be received unless
the rent demands it.

This itemized list was formul-
ated in 1957 and has not been
changed in the past 12 years. It
is based on a family of four -— .a

"mother, a father. a teenager, and

a younger child — the type of fam-
ily least often found on the wel-
fare roll. A few examples only
begin to show how unrealistic the
list is. A recipient housewife is
only entitled to two-thirds of a
brassiere annually, and an elder-
ly woman only one-half.

titled to one-fourth of an overcoat

unless he is employed. An elder-

maximum amount of deodorant
allotted any woman is 1‘/2 ounces
each year, and great numberiof
women do not even get that much.
Each recipient isallotted 450 tis-
sues per year. A single recipient
is allowed one bedsheet, two per-
sons are allowed two, four per-
sons three, and eight persons only
five.

The annual quota of bath tow-
els is even worse. One each for
one or two persons, three for four
persons, and four for eight. This
final example demonstrates how
the larger family is at a great dis-
advantage. A «

This isalso reflected in the

minimum cost of living scales. 

which were revised in 1966 and
have not allowed for inflation
since then. For food those fami-
lies with less than four members
receive comparaiveiy more

monthly per member, and those
with more than four persons re-
ceive comparatively less. This re-
flects a “large economy size” at-
titude, which cannot apply to so

_ small an allowance.

In other scales, such as utilities
and household supplies, families
with “six or more” are lumped
together and given the same
amount.

It is hard to find justification
in these facts for the common be-
lief that recipients try to have
more children to increase the
amount of their welfare checks.
In View of the unrealistic mini-
mum standard and the fact that
each recipient-does not even re-
ceive 100 per cent of that stan-
dard, ‘it is easy to understand
WROAC’s feeling of urgency.
Sine only one and one-half per
cent of the recipients are employ-
able, the problem cannotbe solv-
ed by “putting them to work” as
some might suggest.

Part ‘of the problem can_ be
solved through administrative re-

form. Of the $8 billion spent on _

welfare each year, $4 billion goes
to the bureaucracy. With more
repipient participation WROAC
hopes to cut through some of the
red tape and insure efficiency
and fair welfare practices.

Society, Schools, and Progress in
China
by Chiu-Sam Tsang

Pergamon Press (325 pages)

by PAUL STOLLER
Editor, The Pitt News

With its teeming cities, angry
rhetoric, red guards, and proleter-
ain revolutions, Red China is in-
deed a mystery to men of the Oc-
cident. The mystery has produced
confusion and" ignorance in our
minds. Some of this ignorance, is
swept away by Dr. Tsang’s co-
gent analysis of contemporary
China.

The book is relevant not only be-
cause of the clarity of the an-
alysis, but also because of Dr.
Tsang’s personal experience. His
book reflects the view of a
Chinese — a proud Chinese — look-
ing through the bamboo curtain.
Beyond this, Dr. Tsang spent

some time in Red China. He parti-
cipated in the Chinese People’s
Political Consultative Conference

 

by JOHN HEYDA

Years ago, in a nortorious col-
lection of his various scribblings.
Advertisements for Myself, Nor-
man Mailer wrote: “The sour truth
is that I am imprisoned with a
perception which will settle for
nothing less than making a revolu-
tion in the consciousness of our
time.” Well that was a long
time ago, and although Mr. Mail-
er is still working very-hard at de-
fining the tortured bends and
turns of the uptight American
psyche, his latest efforts at Cine-
ma verite strike this reviewer as
a determined attempt to settle
for something less: the self-glori-
fication of Norman and his idola-
trous friends.

Mailer’s new epic. Beyond the
Law, presented in the Ballroom
last Thursday and Friday nights,
catches our new “Renaissance
Man” in the role of Lieutenant
Francis X. Pope, of the New
York City police force, as he snarls,
curses, pouts and bullies his way
through a day and night at the pre—
cinct station — that curious phy-
chic crossroads where the simple
but rough reclitude, cynicism and
corrupted confusion of the cop’s
hardened heart meets with the
bored, frightened, repentent and-
or embittered mentality of the
would-be criminal. This never-

in ‘Pitt News’ Review ‘assess

 1949. This was the first organiz-
ed meeting between the Chinese

Communists and other political fac-

tions in China. Dr. Tsang remain-
ed in Red China until 1953. At
that time he fled his native city
of Canton to take up residence in
Hong Cong.

Unlike other accounts of China,
Dr. Tsang’s analysis looks at the
Communist Chinese system of
education. In very detailed fash-
ion, Dr. Tsang outlines the con-
nections between government of-
fices, and educational duties. He
stresses the discipline in the
Chinese school system, and the
fact that no grades are given for
courses of instruction.

Another interesting aspect of
the Chinese educational svstem is
its curricular simplicity at the
primary level. “One is struck.”
writes Dr.‘Tsang, by its simpl -
city, which forms a sharp con-
trast to the primary schools in
Hong Kong. The child, according
to Tsang, is not overloaded with
subjects in the Communist

, ending, half-crazed confrontation

between the necessarily self-
righteous defenders of American
law and order, and those who
have in some way run afowl of the
“grand order of things”. pro-
vides much of the substance for
what little genuine drama ac-
tually comes out of Mailer’s film.
But then Mailer is less concern-
ed with drama here than he is
with defining the underlying
psychology of the policeman’s
world. '

The thesis of Beyond the Law,
if one could call it that, comes to
the surface midway through the
film when the Mayor, played
with not a little of the old Lind-
sayesque by George Plimpton,
drops by to see how things are
going in the law — enforcement
business. After casually investiga-
ting the near hysteria created by
the waves of masochism and sad-
ism flowing freely between cops,
detectives, hippies, prostitutes,
Bowery burns and murderers,
Plimpton suggests in his best Ivy
League manner that Lt. Norman
ought to go a bit easier on the
“minority group.. suspects drag-
ged into the station for interro-
gation. Mailer, pensively- tugging
his right earlobe, agrees to clean
things up a bit, and then play-
fully lashes into his troops im-
mediately after the Mayor’s exit.

Chinese schools.

The most interesting section of
the book concerns the Great Pro-
leterian Revolution. It all be-
gan, according to Dr. Tsang with
a controversial play penned by
Wu Han. The Play concerned an
historical figure who, because
of his outspoken manner, was dis-
missed from high politicaloffice.
Combining the controversy of the
play, the repressive climate in
China (1966), and Wu Han’s posi-
tion as Vice-maygr of Peking, the
production of the play cause poli-
tical furor. In 1966 the play was
denounced as “anti-party,” and
Wu Han was purged. But this is
a sidebar to Tsang’s analysis of
army leadership in the Cultural
Revolution.

This sophisticated work by Dr.
Tsang destroys many myths
about contemporary China. Above
all. it is written with the perspec-
tive of a Chinese. This adds an in-
articulable element to the entire
ayalysis. -

“Everytime you overwork some-
body,” he warns his boys, “it con-
fuses something in the nature of
things!” True enough, but Mail-
er then proceeds to lose inter-
est in his thesis, and moves on to
his irrespressible mimicry, clown-
ing and the art of the pretentious
put-on, which is all part of the
price to be paid for having Mail-
er around. ‘

Invariably drawn by the con-
tradictions presented by the “long
finger of God and the swish of
the Devil,” Mailer’s mad ex-
istential genius has frequently
taken off in search of a definition
of the criminal’s world, —one of the
few scenes left where the malig-
nant pleasures of greed, self-in-
dulgence, apathy, and exhaus-
tion come together, shorn of all

Playhouse New Cinema Films:  
Are Groovy Experience  

by DIANA GOODAVAGE

Seeing the Arcturus Collection
of New Cinema Films, which will
be shown during the week of Feb-
ruary 12-17, is definitely a new
experience and worth the time.
The viewer may not understand
all the movies. but some amount
of perception will take place be-
cause of them. which is one good
thing that can be said about any
art form. One will also spend a lot
of time thinking about them after
they're over, and that’s not some-
thing that can be said about aes-
thetically invalid movies.

The Arcturus Collection, Pro-
gram One. is comprised of nine
short movies (from 3-28 minutes)
by various directors, including
Roman Polanski, (who also stars in
his own production, The Fat and
The Lean,) Francois Trauffaut.
and Bruno Bozetto. Collectively,
these movies have won an im-
pressive list of awards such as the
Golden Ducat of the Mannheim
Festival, Silver Lion of St. Mark
of the Venice Film Festival, and
the First Prize of the Internation-
al Film Critics Association. '

middle-class decorum and senti-
mentality. For Mailer is pul-
led by the real. and unlike most
New York based intellectuals,
he is willing to “pay the price”

for seeing into the charnelhouse»
upon which more fashionable so-“

ciety stands. While Mary Mc-
Carthy, for example, has refused
to lower herself so much as ‘to
speak to the very American’G.I.s
she had gone to Vietnam to re-
port on: Mailer dives into these
seemy worlds of death and in-
sanity with fists flying. But what
exactly has our hero brought
back with him from this, his lat-
est expedition into the abyss?
Very little, I’m afraid.

Beyond the Law disappoints in
the end, I feel because it fails
to convey a sense of the dread of

of Hamlet spoken by Maurice
Evans, each word of which is
given its own picture, “with ques-
tionable relevance," as the pro-
gram says.

Les Mistons, by Francois Truf-
faut is an incisive piece of work
about two lovers who are always
being followed and teased by a
bunch of street-urchins. Some-
thing tragic happens in the end.
and the narrator, who was one of
the street-urchins. realizes how
much about life and love he learn-
ed from the lovers. ‘

Bruno Bozetto’s Two Castles
was sort of cute and interesting
in that its art is nothing but a
black and white line drawing.
and it has a clever ending, but
it’s not too meaningful.

Polanski’s The Fat and The
Lean, which has no words, is
moving and pathetic with a pro-
found moral. It’s about a beauti-
ful. talented young boy (played
by Polanski) living in the most
pathetic state of utter physical
and mental abjection possible and
playing nursemaid to a wretch-
ed fat old slob.

 Grapplers Pin Fral Mas all,  O0 

by MARTHA HARTLE

_ For the first time since varsity wrestling was restored in
’ 1949, grapplers captured a shut-out win, as they clobbered the
Franklin and Marshall matmen 40-0 Saturday afternoon in Lan-

caster; ‘ "

_ Earlier in the week, coach Dave Adams was anticipating a tough
' match with F & M, but his anticipations never materialized as the varsity

“did a great job.” .
“Everything worked for us,”
explained Adams. “We started out
well in the early matches and got
‘the momentum and everything

6 just fell in place from there.”

Adams had also expressed con-
cern over a mental letdown fol-
lowing last week’s close loss to
Maryland, but there was no let-
down. “While we expected to win,
we knew if we let down we could

- get beat. When the kids went out

'. «on the mat, they were all busi-

'5

ness.”

Included in the ten wins for
the varsity were four falls, the
most in a varsity match since
Adams has been here and more

_‘ than the total number of falls

for this entire season. Tom Grant
123, Mark Payne 145, Ron Levan-
dowski 177, and Ralph Cindrich
(unl) all pinned their opponents.

According to Adams, Pat Lav-

 ery’s match at 137 was a big in-

fluence on.the remainder of the
‘action. Lavery’ decisioned Jake
Homiak 9-7. Homiak was run-
ner-up in the Eastern Champion-

6" ships last year and was touted

‘as a possible Eastern champ this
season.

Homiak took down Lavery in
the first ten seconds of the match,

but Pat fought back to win the de- -

cision. It was the second straight
"‘big win” for Lavery, who topped
Maryland’s highly rated Dave
Reese last week.

Ron Levandowski picked up his
first win of the year. as he pinned
' Rick McBride at 177. “That was a
real exciting match.” comment-
ed Adams. “The score was tied
when ‘Ron pinned him. He did a real
good job. We didn’t expect a pin
for him.”

Levandowski was behind 5-0
at one point in the match, but

 came back to tie at 5-5 before he

got the pin.
Marty Poehl also picked up his
first win of the season as his op-
ponent Blair Ames was injured and
-forced to défault in the 152
match. Poehl was trailing 4-3
when Ames defaulted.

Riﬂers 7-1  
 After Beating
  Duquesne

The varsity rifle team defeat-
ed Duquesne Friday night. 1298-
1207, for its seventh win in eight

. starts. High scoring sophomore

. , Bill Crooks and junior Dick Brick-

bichler led the way with scores of

1 i 270 and 265 respectively.

Crooks had been ill since Tues-
day and was not expected to com-
pete, but he showed up just before

-the match was to start and went

on the turn in his best perfor-

-mance of the year. High scorer

for the team. and all-American

’ candidate. Crooks is maintain-
ing a 264 average.

Earlier in the week, it was cap-

1 tain John Taucher who managed to

keep cool under pressure, firing
a 270, as the riflers came from
behind to beat Clarion, 1314-1286.
Byron Bonebreak added a 266 as
the varsity topped 1300 for the

first time since going to interna-

tional targets in 1967.
Presently the squad is in second

’ ’place behind Allegheny College.

A double match is scheduled be-
tween the school on March 8.

—by BAYER A

For the second straight match,
Bobby Kuhn came off the injured
list to pick up a victory as he de-

_ cisioned Rick Gleeson, 11-3, at

167. Kuhn had reinjured a should-
ed in the.Maryland match. but he
recovered quicker than expect-
ed and wrestled.

Larry Cuba, Buddy Morris, and
Paul Allen all picked up decisions.
with Allen and Cuba both shutting-
out their opponents. Cuba 130,
beat Jestyn Payne, 11-0, while Al-
len (191) blanked Mike Homiak,
9-0. Morris defeated Terry Bowen
6-3.

Thinclads Enjoy Invi tationals;
Frosh Smash Ohio; 77-38

by ED CONLEY

Jim Banner returned from a weekend of
travel to discover that his freshman thinclads
had taken an impressive 77-38 victory over the
frosh from'Ohio University; his varsity stars didn't
do too badly. either.

The thinclas's strong two-mile relay team took
top honors in their race at the Baltimore Sun Games

Saturday night. The quartet of John Werner. Mark-

Vornhagen, Greg Rodgers and John Aiken left Set-
on Hall and West Chester behind in the runners-up
spots while clocking in at 7:51.

The other relay team didn’t do as well in Balti-
more. The mile-runners (Wally Swiger, Carlos Rei-
sen. Rudy Hufnagel. and Keith Stoeber) finished
third with a time of 3:26 behind Seton Hall and
Fairleigh-Dickinson. ‘

Smitty Brown, the usual anchor man for this
group, had to drop out due to illness. The night be-
fore in the Track Federation Meet in New York,
however, Brown ran with the team and they grab-
bed first place in their chase.

Another varsity trackster used his speed iri Bal-
timore. Jerry Richey. who had been breaking his
own varsity mile record every week, did it again.
Richey placed second behind Dalve Finley of Can-
ada. Finley’s 4:05 and Richey‘s 4:07 were good
times, all right. The important thing is, however.
that both milers ran ahead of Villanova’s Dave_ Pat-
rick and Kent State’s Sam Bair. It was Bair’s first
loss in six tries this winter.

The only other thinclad in the invitationals was
Bryant Salter. The best the high jumper could do
was fifth place. leaping 6’8” in New York and 6'6”
in Baltimore. Florida’s Ron Johnson finished first
in both cities, clearing 7’ in the Sun Games and
7’1" in the.Federation meet.

The frosh win, at the Field House, proved to be
a bit more than the assistant coach, Gary Meckley,
had expected.

“I figured conservatively that we’d win by 15
or 20 points at the most,” he mentioned, “but not
40. I thought they (Ohio U.) had a chance in the
two-mile and in the l000.”

The Bobcats did take the two-mile (Sam Olmas
in 9:46.91, but they couldn’t claim the 1000. Ken
Balkey of the frosh won that one with a time of
2:234; his teammate, Mike Dobsen, followed him
with a 2 : 28.3 clocking.

The win was Balkey’s second of the day; he also
won the mile. Later. he came back to aid the mile
relay team in a victorious effort. Balkey, Paul Pon-
ton, Rick Caraseilli. and Tom Whittaker ran the
race in 3 :32.

The two-mile relay chase was the meet finale;
it was quite a race, too. The freshman group of
Mike_ Wesolewski, Dave Cobb, Dennis Schatzman,
and Dorel Watley squeaked out the win as anchor-
man Watley passed his opposition practically at the
tape. Their time of 8:04.9 set a frosh mark, also.

Don Porotto’s 22’83/4” leap in the long jump was
the only other new record that came out of the
meet, but Ponton did tie the 5.4 standard in the 50-
yard dash.

No Events to Gymnast

by JERRY MYERS

T A very strong Navy gymnastics team completely overpow-I

ered a highly undermanned varsity squad, 143.06-89.40, Satur

day afternoon at the Trees Hall gym. H , V 
The home forces failed to take even one event. while only able to '

enter six men into the competition. The gymnasts sacrificed valuable

points when they entered only two men in both the floor exercise_ and _.

long horse events.

Scoring is based on the highest
three scores by a team in an
event, with a maximum of five
men competing in the event. By
only entering. two men, the varsi-
ty automatically lost those points
that would be scored by the third
man.

Leading the Navy attack were
Steve Klotz and Bob Mackey.
These two Middies competed in
all six events and scored very
high in all of them. Mackey led
all scorers in the long horse, re-
cording a 9.10 rating, while Klotz
took the honors on the parallel
bars with a 8.33 rating.

Highlighting the home scoring
was Lowell Meek, who recorded
an 8.67 in the floor exercise. Phil
Lilly with an 8.10 on the side
horse, and Mike Beatty rating an
8.47 on the long horse. Both Lilly
and Beatty competed in four
events apiece.

‘Cope, tossed in 30 points.

, O’Gorek, as has been the case
in recent games, was the big gun
for the Cubs. He displayed a
variety of shots in tallying 18
points in the first half and nine
in the second.

Guard Bob Cizmarik continu-
ed his fine touch by hitting on a
combination of jump shots and
2 {driving layups. Both he and Steve
Lewis exhibited shifty moves in
" several one-on-one situations.

In addition, both Cizmarik and
Lewis turned out to be the big
,guns in the deciding second half
-‘play. Cizmarik scored 14 of his 20
5 in the last half, whereas Lewis
"contributed all but four of his
game total 17 points in the vital
last 20 minutes.

Tops Against Bucknell

 

Cagers Get
Sloppy, Loss
To Bucknell

The varsity hoopsters aban-
doned their patterned style of
play against Bucknell Satur-
day night, and as a result, they
lost a 13-point lead and the game
71-59.

Playing for the good shot and
shooting 48 percent in the first
half, the cagers took a 36-30 lead
into the dressing room. However,
in the last 20 minutes, coach Buzz
Ridl’s squad became careless, tak-
ing bad shots and only shooting
29 per cent.

“The first half we took the good
shots and moved the ball well,"
said Ridl. “We weren’t patient
enough in the second half.”

Although leading by a.margin of
25-12 in the first stanza, the
cagers saw the margin cut to six by
the half. Shortly after the second
half tap, that lead wad diminish-
ed. Bucknell tied the game at 37.
Twenty seconds later, a jump shot
by Jim Wherry put the Bisons
ahead for good.

The hoopsters got balanced,‘

if low, scoring from Bob McFar-
land (12), Bob Petrini (10), and
Mike Patcher (10). Senior for-
ward Bob Greenwood tallied 23
for the Bisons, who put four men
into double figures.

The cagers cut the Bucknell
lead to six points with about two
and a half minutes left, but a full-
court press backfired as the Bi-
sons scored several easy buckets.

GIRLS WIN

The women’s varsity basketball team picked up its third vic-
tory in as many starts Wednesday night as they slaughtered Mt.
Mercy 75-15 in the Trees Hall gym. Phyllis Wojeciechowski led
the winners with 28 points.

The girls also hold wins over Kent State 26-23 and Chatham
55-11. Coached by Miss Audrey Cale, the next game is scheduled
for February 12 in Trees Hall, when the hoopsters tackle Chat-
ham.
