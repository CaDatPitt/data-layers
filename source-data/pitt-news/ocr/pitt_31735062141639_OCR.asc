The Pitt‘ campus week ﬁnancial
drive began last Monday morning.
The main booth ofthe campaign is

. . located at the foot of Alumni’ Hall,
. hcenter steps. . V
' The .comm_ittees are workingto
.make everything a success. ‘The one
' dollar is just two-thirds the price-of
* V the dance‘ which will be held in the
, ’Duquesne_“ ‘Garden and ‘perhaps the
“"Syr‘ia‘ Mosque if the ‘crowd is larger
V than~-anticipated. The dance is one
‘of, the many events scheduled during
 J-.the',;.week which" the ticket permits
' entrance to. _
The lawn fete is already. a popular
‘:<coming'attraction and -the'_‘re will be a
‘ ’--{band fwhicli, ha's;a.1'dange.d a concert. _-
‘ ‘ . A_ May Day‘ exercise will. liven
things up and thereal fun will begin
when the various organizations,.in-’
. . ‘eluding the fraternities, put on their
-‘j.__St11D.tS.' It is the first of its kind but
'. its success is assured by the rapid_i.ty
of the disappearance of the ’ tit-.k_e‘ts
 from the hands of the. .commfitte.e..in
charge. ’ Including today there ‘are.
‘ ‘ just four more days to get that ‘ticket.
' Tho.—b_ooth*,still has tickets and your

-was quarterback, being in charge of
these cymbals, which could .d_ro_w_n out

This .narrative_‘g_oes back to the

.Prob,ably the greatest event, inuthe’

nior play given by the class of_’_83: un
der the’ direction of Prof. Paul F.
Rohrbacher,‘ when
was enacted. I have before me "the
newspaper clippings of this‘. dramatic

“William  Tell’ ~

event. ‘One of ,these—-from the Dis-"f

ject of _the....producti‘6'n_‘ was__- not only ’

the famous actors of the ‘class took '

 

 

_liam. Tell,” F. W.-Jen_ki.ns was “Ber-
J. D. Mccabe was.‘ “Walther -Furst,”

“Budenz.” The play was such a great
success‘that the next year the class
again appeared in “Der Neffe als
Onkle,” which was given in the old
_FifthVA'venue Lyceum. , The Univer-
sltylboys were assisted in this ‘_play
by the membersof the Senior class
of the Pittsburgh Female College. in
this play the author took the leading
role,'assisted by Miss Foster, who as
"‘Sophie,”- made quite an impression.
The “Commercial Gazette” ‘staid the
_next day, “The worthy _ Professor
wouTd greatly please the lovers of the
German‘ ‘drama ‘by reproducing the
play in one of the large theaters.” As
a’ result,‘ the play was reproduced in
Freimaurer-Halle on April 19, 1883.
before a large audience, and with all
of the fine stage effects possible. The
costumes were most elegant, so ‘ele-
gant, in fact, that ittook all of' the
proceeds to partly" pay the .bill for
them. Through the influence of Pro-
fessor Rohrbacher
‘Maccracken the trustees of the Uni-
‘versitypaid the balance of the bill’.
As I read. the press. notices of this
event in theatrical circles, isome-
tlmes feel that the American stage
lost a lot of great actors when the
members of the ‘class of ’83 became
millionaires, writers, lawyers, preach-
ers and such like. ' . "

One of the great social events of
each year was the Annual Pilgrimage
of the’ class of ’83 to Deer Creek, to
the hold Denny estate, which was then
occupied by Dr. S. F. Scovel. This
‘gathering took place‘ on Decoration
