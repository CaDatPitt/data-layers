Pitt student raped
in North Oakland

SHANNON McLAueHLIN

News Editor

A 21-year-old Pitt student woke to an intruder who
allegedly raped her in her first-ﬂoor apartment "on Bayard
Avenue in. the early morning on June 27.

3 In an‘ incident report report ﬁled by Sgt. Karen Healy of
the Pittsburgh police department, the intruder was
described as a dark-complected black male approximately
5 feet 7 inches tall, of medium build, with a mustache and

morning.

 

The man, who held a kitchen knife to the victim’s
throat, threatening her before the attack, entered the apart-
ment at approximately 2:30 a.m. ’

‘Police found no signs of forced entry in her Amberson
Apartment unit, and the student reported to police that her
door was locked when she went to sleep around 1:30 that

In the incident report, she.told police that the intruder
told her he entered the apartment using her keys. ’

Security guard Edward Jones Jr. told police that he had
not noticed anything when he checked the exterior of the
complex during his nightly duties 'a”r'o’unt1’2:30"a.m.‘

The student also told police that the intruder made sev-
eral comments concerning a Pitt student organization that
she is involved in, which, led her to believe the man may
have known her prior to the attack.

Police‘ transported the victim to Magee—Womens
Hospital, where she was later released in good condition.

' The intruder was reportedly wearing dark clothing,
including a brown suede hat of the victim’s. The report also
stated that the man had wrapped a pair of the victirn’s black
_ pants around his face. _ '
Police have developed a composite sketch of the sus-
, pect which is not being released to the media, as the matter
remains under investigation. . A

Board of Trustees approves largest tuition   hike in eight years

REHAN NASIR‘
Editor“ in Chief .

As University of Pittsburgh Board of
Trustees members were re-elected in a
meeting on June 30, theﬁscal year 2000
proposed budget was also accepted, ensur-
ing a 5 percent increase in tuition and fees
for some 30,000 students at Pitt.

The budget,which included the largest
tuition hike in eight years, and-measured an
increase of more than twice the rate of inﬂa-
tion, was proposed at a June 23 meeting
and passed a week later. -

In the College of Arts and Sciences,
Pitt’s largest school, tuition has increased
by $304 to $6,422.

The 5 percent increase at Pitt is similar
to increases at other state schools, including
those in the State System of Higher
Education. The system raised tuition 4.8
percent at its 14 stateowned universities,
including Edinboro, Clarion and Kutztown.

The Penn State board of trustees pro-
posed a 6.23 percent tuition increase for
next fall, which will be voted on Friday.
The raise would make full-time undergrad-
uate tuition $6,546, an increase of $384.

At the board meeting, Pitt Chaneellor .

Mark Nordenberg addressed the increases
over the past ﬁve years in applicants to Pitt,
their average SAT scores, research funding
and endowments.

‘The outlook of Pitt is as bright as a
freshman looking out from the top of the

- said."  

Catliedral for the ﬁrst time,’.’ Nordenberg
j Pitt’s board also accepted the 
of axzcommunication, arts and technology
building on Bradford’s campus after the
Blaisdell family. The family founded the
Zippo Manufacturing Company and have
provided numerous ﬁnancial gifts to Pitt.

County Executive James Roddey was
also named as an Emeritus Trustee. Roddey
had been a trustee "until 1999 and served in
the areas of ‘health sciences, institutional
advancement ‘and nominating standing
committees. , , '

J. Wray Connolly was also re-elected
as chairperson of the Board of Trustees for
another year. He will be succeeded next
year by William S. Dietrich II, who was

 chairperson designate of the Board

of Trustees. _ ‘
The board also approved an increase in

‘the new student orientation fee at the

Titusville campus. The increase from $35
to $45 will deﬁay the cost of the new stu-
dent orientation program, which students
take inthe beginning of the fall and spring
terms. The programs aim to keep the colle-
giate transition as smooth as possible for
Titusville students; ’
A similar raise was accepted for
Greensburg, raising the fee from $35 to $40
for each freshman. Greensburg will also
raise its student intercollegiate athletics fee
from $40 per term to $55. The increase will

line, to pursue a biology degree with

‘ the hopes of becoming a veterinarian.

Carter 1aughs,“back then, women
were not welcomed in the field.”

Her first job out of college
involved working with volunteers
and she served as class agent for her
college’s annual fund. This volunteer
position led to her being offered ‘a
position at her alma mater as assistant
director of the annual fund in 1974.

This became another first for
Carter as, “most of the alumni direc-
tors and public relations directors at
that time were men,” she said.

In 1982, the newly married Carter
arrived in Pittsburgh as director of
annual giving at Carnegie Mellon
University and her string of firsts
continued. ‘

“I was:-one of the first people in
Pittsburgh to get my certification as a
fund-raising professional,” Carter
said. - 5

After four years, Carter came to
Pitt for her first stint, fortuitously
working with the then-acting dean of
the law school, a young fellow named
Mark N ordenberg.

Carter, the first decentralized

" director of development at Pitt,
worked with Nordenberg raising‘

funds exclusively for the law school;

She stayed at CMU for nearly 7 .1/2
years until Pitt named its new chan-
cellor, Mark Nordenberg.»

“Mark called me and asked me if
I would be interested in going
through the Search process,” Carter
recalls. "

For the new chancellor, the deci-
sion to hire Carter was simple.

“Few positions are more..impor-
tant to sustaining the strength of the

University, and I am confident in .

Carol Carter’s ability to be an articu-
late and effective representative for
Pitt,” Nordenberg said.

Carter is still breaking new
ground as she is still only one of five
or six women in the American
Association of Universities, an orga-
nization consisting of- the top 60 pri-
vate and public research universities,
who holds such an esteemed position.

Describing her 1 position Carter’
states, “Technically, I am responsible '

But, she said, “What I really do is
two things and I prefer" the one but I
have to do the other.”

She said that relating internally to
the other parts of the University was
a major part of what she does.

“We believe, in institutional
advancement, that we work for the
good of the University but we don’t
set the priorities of what we raise dol-
lars for,” she said.

She affirmed that the top admin-
istration at Pitt makes the decisions.

think that we set the priorities and we
have our own objectives,” she added.
“No, no, no, we don’t. I constantly
explain that we take our marching
orders from the central institution and
trustees.” = ‘

Carter and her team are preparing
for the University’s October ki_ckoff

of the school’s largest capital cam!"

paign drive. Noting that the
University could ‘never hire enough
staff to do the necessary solicitation

calls, Carter’s main objective is to’

build a pool of approximately 250
volunteers through the ranks, schools,
departments and regional campuses.

She is quick to credit the
University’s trustees.

“The trustees make all the differ-
ence here, they are active volun-

And University trustees think
highly of Carter.

According to Tom Bigley, a
University trustee and retired manag-
ing partner of Ernst & Young, “Caro1
is warm and friendly. She is extreme-
ly well-prepared for any meeting
whether internal administration, on
visits with" alumni or with proposals.”

Bigley continues that she is,
“very professional in how' she5
approaches every aspect of institu-
tional advancement. I always think of
the three Ps with Carol — pleasant,
prepared and professional.”

Away from the office, Carter is
married to Bob Carter, president of
Ketchum Inc., a fund—raising counsel
firm.

of work,” she says about her husband.

Carter has two stepsons but also
states laughingly, “Bob and I finally
have two girls; Daisy and Lilly, our
two young Labrador retriever pup-
pies.” .

Her favorite activity is traveling.
She and Bob have taken a few trips to
Europe. They try to get down to Hope
Town in the Bahamas for a few weeks
each year where water is collected in
cisterns and telephones are ‘scarce.

Carter reflects that growing up on
the farm and being the first-born
helped her in many ways. -

“1 think being first-born and the”

EDITORIAL
Fred Primus deserves

a second chance

You may know the story of
“Les Miserables,” the novel by
Victor Hugo that traces the life of
Jean Valjean, a one-time thief.
After stealing a loaf of bread, he is
pursued till the end of his days by
the unforgiving Inspector Javert.
Javert never forgives him for his
crime, no matter how many good
deeds he comrriits.

'Fred Primus, a former basket-
ball player for Pitt, suffered a sim-
ilar fall from grace. In 1999, he
was caught stealing a good sum of
jewelry. He lost his scholarship

and the privilege of playing bas-

ketball for Pitt. He also did 200
hours of community service and
paid a ﬁne.

No one will dispute that steal- I

ing is a rotten thing to "do, and
offenders should be punished.
After all, theft is not a mistake, but
a calculated crime. But now, after
playing basketball at ‘Barton
County Community College for a
year, Primus has once again earned
his scholarship, this time at East
Carolina University. Is this a suc-
cess story, or a case of justice
falling short?

Many may argue that sports
scholarships are a load of bunk

- anyway. Why should students get

free rides for playing a game? And

‘why give -money to a convicted

felon? Won’t this just encourage
him to strike again?

Probably not. People are errat-
ic sometimes, but one mark on
your record shouldn’t require eter-
nal retribution. Of all the crimes he
could have committed — murder,
rape, destruction of property — he
chose a petty one.

The police returned the jewel-
ry, and Primus did penance for it.
Now he has a chance to be a suc-
cessful player at East Carolina,
with the opportunity to make bas-
kets and win games.

If he can earn his degree at the
same time, isn’t that a success and
not a failure?

Also consider the alternatives.
It’s clear Primus has a passion for
basketball, so 'why prevent him
from playing if his record has since
been clean? He could have given

‘up and picked up a job at some

deli, but he climbed out of the rut.
If he steals again, sure, dismiss the
guy for good, but what kind of per-
son would endanger his future
twice? And Mike Hamrick,-- the
director of athletics at ECU, seems
to have the situation well in hand.
He’s given Primus adequate warn-
ing.

So instead of dwelling on his
past transgressions, let’s be happy
that he’s ﬁnding a new niche.

Science demands faith, too

I was sitting in my engineering class the
other day when the professor started talking
about reasons for failure in materials. He
eloquently categorized many modes and
answered many similar questions posed by
several members of the confused audience.
My mind drifted‘ from the dialogue and I
kept asking myself why I should believe his
explanations. V '

This has happened to me in every disci-
pline I have studied, either in college or real
life. The question of “Why, really?” has
come up time and again. Like a little kid, I
always wanted more answers than
the speaker or author would
address. Scientists, especially in
established fields, believe the
answers they give are the ﬁnal fact
(and we are often tested on these
facts). But people of science share the
necessity to believe in the conclusions of
their discipline just as people of faith do’ in
theirreligion.

We have spent centuries looking into
the nature of the universe, posing many dif-

I ferent theories (such as quantum theory).

We have analyzed the atom, nucleus, proton,
neutron and quark, and‘ ultimately we still

_ cannot say what the universe is made of. I

.To prove these ﬁnite theories, experi-
ments are first designed to help prove the
postulates. The results are then recorded and
analyzed, and the theory is modiﬁed or
proven within the accepted statistical limit.
The resulting theory only explains what the
scientist can interpret from the results. Most
of the time, we can observe rough correla-

I tions and write equations, but beyond that

our interpretations,of the data are based on
educated guesswork. This resulting theory is
often presented as 'fact in books. Data are
presented as proof.

But are. these proofs always trustwor-

thy? I say no, because of statistical variance,

which leaves much "room for so-called mira-
cles that lie outside the predicted: range of
results. ' .

Theories about why things happen are

STAFF WRITER

 

not limited to science. Historians often lack
firsthand witnesses. Historians often make
general theories about the past and present
that can leave the listener or reader dissatis-
ﬁed with the reasons.

0 Can we really believe that all the facts
about the past are true? Quite often, all we
have are writings, words passed down, or
scattered artifacts. Historians who think

they know print these interpretations as fact”

in their respective books. Proposing ideas as
fact is ‘what philosophers do best.
Philosophical theories play the distinctly
' American game of vote—your—
own—theory, since they never
seem_to reach a consensus on
any idea. Why not? Over the
centuries, so many theories on
so -many similar subjects
would take us centuries to read.

Finally, like duplicitous philosophy,
many theologies, have developed different
theories about a higher power, our existence
and telos, or end. Yet again, like the
American ideal, each person can pick and

- choose which theory he or she believes

offers the impetus the nature of the universe
before the hypothetical big bang. Yet again
we must believe in those who send the mes-
sage about the world beyond. Who best
described that world, Muhammad, Moses,
Confucius, Buddha or Jesus?

I don’t mean to say that there isn’t any-
thing out there in which to believe. But not
only religious people have to apply faith to
the question of why or how. Simply put,
those of the natural and social sciences

should realize that they require faith to --

guide their work. The scientist’s search for
understanding of the world’s nature runs a
direct parallel to the person of faith’s search
for truth of the world beyond this natural
one.

Gerald McClain believes the one who can
truly teach us the truth about the world
beyond is he who was there: Jesus and the
Spirit.

Is anyofiieg-else»~fbesides me tired of hearing
about Oprah a'"ndf"her book club? I go into Barnes

and her clrI“'.l,).~’:!I:n”-tire University Book Center, it’s
Oprah and her club. Who is a member, anyway?
How do you become a member? Do you have to
be a guest in the live studio audience? Or do you
simply have to buy one of those books
with the little sticker on it? Has anyone
ever even met with the book club orga-
nizer other than through his or her tele-
vision set?

Now I’ll admit that maybe I’m just a
jealous writer who ‘knows that if Oprah put a

sticker on a collection of my stories they would

sell like Iron City at a Steelers game. It’s not that
I don’t like Oprah. I believe that she has done a
lot of good for humanity — she’s just a little too
sentimental for me.

But I am not one to complain if I don’t have
my own solution to the problem. Therefore I’m
starting my own book club. It’ll be called Carl’s
Book Club (for lack of a better name).

Now I don’t have any fancy stickers’, but
there is a Web site (www.pitt.edu/~cwsst20), and
you can reach me by e—mail at Carl-
bookclub@hotmail.com.

We will all join together inrdiscussing the
greatest literature of the last 1,000 years or so. I
will not be held within the bonds of mere con-
temporary literature when there is a whole mil-
lennium of great worksto be discussed. Later on
in this article (after the commercial I’ll break)
I’ll be introducing the first selection, to be read

during the month of July. However, please feel
free to write and give suggestions for future
reading. If there is a positive response, we’ll
even get together on the Cathedral of Learning
lawn and discuss what we’ve read.

So now that I have everyone full of anticipa-
tion and excitement for the unveiling of the very
first Carl’s Book Club selection,
here it is. It was a bestseller during
the medieval period written by a
rebellious Florentine (known in his
day for getting in trouble with a
variety of authority figures). He
even lived a great portion of his life in exile after
publication of his greatest work infuriated read-
ers. How many of Oprah’s authors can say that?
Ladies and gentlemen, “Inferno” by Dante!

Carl’s Book Club will spend the next month
plunging through the rings of Hell with Dante
and Virgil as our guide. -

It is going to be exciting.

This epic poem is full of suspense, drama,
and even a little humor, as we will discover
alongwith Dante and the world of sinners. How
deep in Hell do they lie? Where in Hell would
you fall? There is even some sentimentality for
fans of Oprah, so bring tissues. Get your copy
and start reading!

Why Dante?

Well first, I’m an Italian major, and second,"

some big names in the world of literature think
he is important. Robert Pinsky, poet laureate of
the United States deemed the’ “Infer‘no”ii'mpor-
tant enough to do’ a new translation of theltalian

WEDNESDAY, [um 12, 2000

Forget Oprah; Schneider’s book club rules 

work as recently as 1994.

Don’t feel obligated to buy Pinsky’s transla- _
tion. It is a hardcover and fairly expensive. The ‘

paperback editions are significantly cheaper,
which is another advantage Carl’s Book Club has
over Oprah’s. , x.

If you’re a “member” of Opra-h’s book club
you can’t get anything she is currently reading in
paperback. Unless you are a wealthy talk show
host you have to wait a year andwby then her
‘club’ is reading something else.

Which reminds me, why are all of the books
featured on Oprah’s show considered Oprah’s
books? ‘

When one looks in the bookstore and sees
that ever—present sticker, one doesn’t say, “This
is the new book by so and so that Oprah’s Book
Club is reading.”

No. _

One says, “This is Oprah’s new book.” I’m
sorry, but as a writer, that just _doesn’t seem" just

and right to me. Everyone is giving Oprah cred- ‘

it for something she 'didn’t even write.

'1 expect at least the majority of. the
University to have a copy in hand by the end of
the week. E—mail me so you can be put on the
distribution list to receive Carl’s Book Club

‘ls Moose and Squirrel!’

Heroic duo Victoriously debut on big screen

I ROBERT DITTMAN

Staff Writer

The call has gone—out. Moose and Squirrel are on the
loose. The nefarious and hilariously inept duo of Boris
Badenov (Jason Alexander) and Natasha (Rene Russo) has
their orders from Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro). The
object is clear —— set aside everything and destroy the moose
and the squirrel. V

So begins a dizzying and freewheeling revival of Jay
Ward’s .‘60s TV series “The Adventures of Rocky and
Bullwinkle.” Both title characters are denizens of the ﬁc-
tional but colorful Frostbite Falls, Minn. This time, as
always, our intrepid, 1oveable- but endearingly stupid ani-
mated stars are put to work saving the world, and interact

,with"equal1y strange live action characters. As if saving the
world was not challenge enough.

‘ A human actor in a Disney animal ﬂick once, lamented
that the one thing he and other human actors could count on
was being upstaged by the animal performers. Such is the

involving an incompetent but well-intentioned FBI agent

named Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) and a handsome
freshly-scrubbed Swedish hunk actually works well. No
word yet whether Sympathy would have an eye for either
Rocky or Bullwinkle should the Swedish guy not pan out.

Our animated heroes are dragged out of retirement and
their comfortable animated World to save us all from a das-
tardly plot to take over the world. The chase is on to save the
world from RBTV (Really Bad TV), which will hypnotize
and paralyze the world. Hmmm  has the battle been lost
before the opening credits? ' .

This is not a movie to be carefully analyzed but
enjoyed. Animation and live action work well —- or at least
well enough to provoke laughs at appropriate moments.

Then there "is intentionally bad narration and impossibly

coincidental plot twists.

Alexander and Russo seemingly have a great time ham-
ming it up as Cold War leftovers. De Niro unashamedly
parodies his celebrated Travis Bickle character demanding
of Badenov, “You — you talkin’ to me?” o

It would be unfair to give away the ending of any
movie. So questions remain. Do Rocky and Bullwinkle tri-
umph? Would a wild moose, cartoon or otherwise, uh, per-
form a natural function in the woods? What about an ani-
mated function in a cartoon forest? “Rocky and
Bullwinkle” is broad political satire couched in the most
disarming of approaches —— humor.

ment. T .

  ‘Evita’
shines on
stage as

well as film

LAUREN SHURTZ C

Staff Writer

Although Eva Peron’s grave reads, “Don’t
cry ‘for me,” when she died on July 26, 1952,
Argentina wept. ‘ 

Eva, more; affectionately known as Evita,
was a political and cultural icon of the 1940s in
Argentina. From the age of 15, Eva Duarte,
manipulated men to ensure her success as a
model and actress and improve her social posi-
tion.

After marrying Col. Juan Peron, the beauti-
ful and charismatic Eva led Peron to the presi-
dency. Peron won the election and Evita active-
ly pursued her role as the first lady of
Argentina, often upstaging her husband in the
way Hillary Clinton does today. -

However, not "everyone loved “Santa
Evita.” The aristocracy and army were against

her, and the
middle—class
that Evita

claimed to rep-
resent realized

 

promises came
to fruition.

Eva Peron has been immortalized on stage.
She enchanted the world so much that “Evita,”
a Tony Award-winning musical, has been per-
formed in theaters for more than 20 years.

The Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera is cur-
rently producing its third run of the classic.

“Evita” begins just after Eva Peron’s death,

when the country is in mourning. Without dia-

logue, the show relates the life of Eva Duarte
Peron entirely through song. Ranging from fast
and fun to slow and haunting, each song is
marked by an event or time in Eva’s life.

“Goodnight and Thank You,” a number in
the first act, tells of all the men Evita trampled
during her sordid climb to the top, “We’d love
you stay but you’d be in the way, so do up your
trousers and go.”

Eva’s career and inﬂuence peak in the
beginning of Act 2, with “High Flying, Adored”
and “Rainbow High.” V _ 

But her health and fame deteriorate as Act 2

V closes and, “she’s sad for her country. Sad to be

‘Kid’ does we

JUSTIN KRAUSS
Staff Writer

Disney’s “The Kid” made me
hope that no former self of mine ever
visits me, because many of these
memories I want to forget. .

“The Kid” is a funny, cute and
sometimes touching look at a man’s
life. This . movie works like “A
Christmas Carol” but without the
stilted English accents. »

Russ (Bruce Willis) is turning 40.
He’s a very successful image consul-
tant, but successful means ruthless in
these stories. He is visited by Russ II
or Rusty (Spencer Breslin), a chub-
bier version of himself at age 8.

Well, comedy high jinks ensues
from there. The Russes have to find a
way to get the little one back to his
own time. We find out that Russ has
some unfinished business left from
his grade school days, and it’s up to
Russ II to finish the
business.

“The Kid” is bor-
derline stupid many
times, but never
quite makes it there.

Former Pitt hoopster Primus tries to resu

MARIO MACHI

Sports Editor

In the world of sports, second chances are common.
Without them, where would Dennis Rodman, Darryl
Strawberry and Leon Lett be? Now, Fred Primus has an
opportunity to join the group of players who have been
granted second chances.

Primus, who was dismissed from the Pitt basketball
team in 1999, has committed to East Carolina University,
marking his return to Division I basketball after spending
a season at Barton County Community College in Great
Bend, Kan.

Primus was a freshman at Pitt, under the tutelage of
former coach Ralph Willard, when his career as a
Panther ended after a road trip to Villanova.

Along with teammates Ricardo Greer, Jarrett
Lockhart and Jason Boyd, Primus broke curfew and left
the team hotel to go to the house of Boyd’s friend to
watch a pay-per-view boxing telecast.

After they returned to the hotel, a resident of the

house reported that she was missing jewelry, which was
1 subsequently found in a sock in Primus’ backpack in his

hotel room. a

The theft of the jewelry, which was valued at $2,278,
resulted in Primus agreeing to a plea bargain in which he
was placed in a program for ﬁrst-time offenders.

He performed 200 hours of community service and

paid a ﬁne of $475. ,,

Primus’ actions landed him in a small town in the
middle of Kansas, where he played under coach Ryan
Wolf at Barton County Community College;

“Fred is a great kid,” Wolf said. “He did really well
here and I think he’ll do well in the future.”

East Carolina director of athletics Mike Hamrick
was unavailable for comment, but he told The News &
Observer of Raleigh, N.C., that the school checked up on
Primus before offering him a position on the basketball
team. .

“We did our homework,” Hamrick told the newspa-

per. “We knew about his past, and we spelled out the con— V

sequences of another mistake in front of his family in his
living room.” »

ECU head basketball coach Mike Herrion concurred
with Hamrick, but thought that Primus was a more
mature player now than he was when he was at Pitt.

“He’s not the ﬁrst or last person who’s made a bad
decision,” Henion said. “He’s not the ﬁrst or last to get a
second chance or another opportunity.”

Schools that showed "interest in Primus were
Cincinnati, Kansas State, Temple, Louisiana State and
Florida State. 7

Primus was offered scholarships by American
University and the University of New Mexico before set-
tling on East Carolina. New Mexico assistant coach Troy

The deal with Steel City Media,

Assistant Sports Editor

_ A former Panther finally got a
chance at the Major Leagues in late June
and has made the most of his chance.

Jason Conti, an outﬁelder with Pitt
from 1994-96, was called up by the
Arizona Diamondbacks on June 29, and
has played in 10 games since then.

Conti is third at Pitt in career—hits
with 154, secondgin runs with 120, and
10th in RBIs with 80.

He was drafted in the 32nd round by '

the Diamondbacks after the,1996 season,
and worked his way up through the D-
backs minor league system.

He started at the AAA level this year
with the Tucson Sidewinders and hit .308
in 78 games. Conti scored 62 runs, hit’ 10
home runs and drove in 51 runs before
getting his first shot at the majors.

He has fared well at Arizona thus far,

collecting eight hits in 29 at—bats, six '

RBIs and two stolen bases.
. The length of his stay in the big

leagues is unkn'own." He‘ was called up

when one of the team’s regulars, Erubiel
Durazo, was placed on the disabled list.

A If he impresses the D—backs enough,
the team said they will find room for him,
but also said that Conti needs to play

every day to develop and the best place

for him to do that this year is at the 
level.

Jason Rakers, who played just one
season at Pitt in_ 1992, is the only other
Panther to have played in the big leagues
this year, pitching for the Kansas "City
Royals. He has since been sent back

8 for Conti

down to AAA Omaha after an unsuccess-
fulstint. , ‘
There are three other former
_ Panthers playing professional baseball at
the minor—league level.

Third baseman Joe Lydic and pitcher
Jory Coughenour, both drafted" by the
Houston Astros in_ early June, are playing
for‘ the short—season A—league Auburn
Doubledays.

After a hot start, Lydic has cooled
off, hitting .254 in 18 games, with one
home run and seven RBIs. He has struck
out 20 times in 67 at-bats.

Coughenour has started four of the
tearn’s 20 games on the mound, and has a
3-0 record to show for it, which ties him
the team lead in victories. In 23 1/3
innings, Coughenour has allowed just 10
earned runs, and has struck out 12 batters.

Lou Melucci, who was drafted in the
26th round by the Montreal Expos in
1999, is with the A—1eague Cape Fear
Crocs in North Carolina. _

Melucci has struggled, hitting just
.218 in 124 at-bats for the Vermont Expos
last summer. _ A

Steve Vickroy decided to pitch in one
of, the several independent leagues‘ that
are not affiliated with Major League
Baseball. L _ "

These leagues, however, do serve as

a showcase for players who were not ~

drafted or‘ signed, and Major League
scouts often find players who were earli-
er overlooked. ,

Vickroy is with the Johnstown

,,Johnnies and has a 11-0 record in ﬁve

appearances. He has eight strikeouts in
12 1/3 imiings, but does have-a lofty 5.84
ERA.

are injured.

. Pedro Martinez, Greg Maddux and
Cal Ripken Jr., of all people, missed the
game as well.

Martinez and Maddux did miss starts
with their teams before the All-Star break,
so no beef from me there.

Ripken had started 16 All-Star games ,

in a row before last night. He deserves
one off.

Griffey competed in Monday night’s
Home Run Derby and lost in the ﬁnal to
Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa. Why couldn’t
he play four or ﬁve innings and then give
way to Brian Giles of the Pirates? It’s a
load of crap. The Home Run Derby puts
more strain on a body than four innings of
a game. ‘

I don’t know why fans Voted for
Griffey, anyway. He’s hitting about .240,
which is worse than Kevin Young.

McGwire needed to be there, in the
derby, and in the game. “Big Mac” has
done more for the game of baseball in the
last few years and fans come to the ball-
park to see him.

_ It will be a shame if he’s back playing
on Thursday for the first-place Cardinals.

, At least Sosa thrilled the fans with his
long balls on Monday night.

Mike Piazza got drilled in the head by
a Roger Clemens pitch on Saturday and
probably couldn’t remember what an All-
Star was when he was asked if he was
playing. “

Bonds actually said, ‘‘I don’t think
[fans] are upset if you’re hurt. They’d be
upset if you didn’t come.”

Right, Barry. They want to see you in

street clothes watching the game like they
are.
Jermaine Dye of the Kansas City
Royals actually got voted in as a starter.
Either_ fans are waking up or the league
had some ‘ballot-stuffmg going on to
restore some validity to the voting
process. ‘

The only good thing about all the
stars being injured ‘is that the replace-
ments got well-deserved All-Star appear-
ances.

Guys like Jeffrey Hammonds, Jose
Vidro, Joe Girardi, Troy Glaus, Matt
Lawton and Jason Isringhausen got a
chance at the national spotlight.

The All—Star game is also a good time
to review the ﬁrst half of the season and
my wonderful prediction of Albert Belle

That means he would have to hit 42
homers in the last 76 games of the season
for my prognostication to be deemed
ingenious. _

That’s a heavy home run pace, but if
anyone can do it, it’s Belle, right?

The two teams I picked to make the
World Series, the Astros and Orioles, are
a combined 68-105, which once again
proves that I know nothing. About any-

Weaver ' was an assistant on Willard’s ,

staff when Primus played for the
Panthers. 1 '

At Barton County, Primus was a sig-
niﬁcant contributor off the bench for a
team that finished the season 32-2,

ranked No. 1 in the ﬁnal national junior’

college poll. V

He averaged 11.5 points and 3.7
rebounds per game for Barton County,
but most importantly, according to Wolf,
was his sharp-shooting ability.

“He could control a game with his
shooting,” .Wolf said. “I knew he was a

' good player, and he is one of the -best

shooters I’Ve ever had here.”
Primus hit 89 of 239 three—point
attempts for the Cougars.

While Primus’ arrest may have been i ‘

the incident that set in motion the events
that led to Willard’s resignation at Pitt,
the forlner Pitt coach didn’t let that stop

him from issuing a good recommenda-

tion for Primus.

Helrion contacted Wlﬂard, who gave .

a favorable report on Primus, according

I to The News & Observer. '

The “newspaper said that Wlﬂard said
at the time, he dismissed Primus thathe
