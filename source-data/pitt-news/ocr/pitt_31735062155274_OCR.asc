UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Library Will Maintain
Sunday Time Schedule,

Weekly Hours Altered

By MARSHA REHNS
Although closed last Sunday, the reference, reserve
and circulation departments of the library will remain open
on future Sundays, Dr. Harold Lancour, dean of the Gradu-
ate School of Library and Information Services, announced.

 

Weekday hours, however, will be altered. -_
The library was forced to close on Sunday because it
was thought that its “use did not justify the expend1ture”

necessary to keep it open. It is
difficult to tell how many ‘stu-
dents using the library create a
real need, but we would not
want to cause students any hard-
ship. “It is a point of efficiency,"
Dean Lancour explained. “Dollar
for dollar it is not necessary to
keep the library open for a hand-
ful of students.”

At present, however, it has
been determined that a need for
the library on Sunday exists so
that it will remain open. The li-
  now "close at 5, p.m.
on Fridays instead of 6 p.m. and
open at 9 a.m. on Saturday rather
than at 8:30. “These hours,” com
mented Dr. Lancour, “should not
cause too much inconvenience.”

A student who explained that
he uses the reserve room for
three of his courses offered to

work for nothing for thelibrary

on Sundays if lack of staﬁ were
the only factor in closing. Ac-
cording to Dean Lancour, this
was not a good answer to the
problem because the -thousands

of books in the library represent .
.too great a responsibility to the

student. “We would rather solve
the problem professionally,” he
added. a

“As long as the use and kind
of use warrants it, the library
will remain open. From a li-
brarian’s view, we would like to
stay open, otherwise we would
not be in this business,” he con-
cluded. ‘

If the library would be forced
to close again on Sundays, an
effort would be made to reopen
it on Sundays during the ﬁnal
exam, periods.

Army and Air Force Incorporate

By AL D’l1’POLI'l‘0

Major changes in both the Army and
Air Force Reserve Officer's Training Corp
(ROTC and AFROTC) programs are under
way at the University.

The AFROTC four year program will be
phased out and replaced by a two year pro-
gram. The Army ROTC will retain its tradi-
tional four year program but will complement it
with the two year program.

The changes were announced by Lt. Col Wil-
liam C. Tinsley, professor of Aerospace, and Lt. Col.
Benjamin Hollis, professor of military science for
the AFROTC and Army ROTC respectively’

Under the new ROTC Vitalization Act of 1964
the University had threeoptions on its ROTC pro-
“grams: retain the present four year program, switch
over to the two year program or offer a combination
of both. 

Dr. Alan C. Rankin, assistant to the chancellor
for student and general affairs, informed Col. Tins-
ley that the University had elected the two year
program for AFROTC. The program will go into
eﬁect in the fall trimester. ‘

Under the new program AFROTC will be avail-
able to those from the regional campuses, junior
colleges and those students who did not enter the
program as freshmen. .

Students already in the four year program will

continue in it until completion and awarding of a
commission.

“In order to qualify for enrollment in the two- . 

year course,” Col. Tinsley stated, “applicants must

complete a six week summer training course at an ‘ ’ ‘

Air Force base. This summer training course re-
places the two years of the basic AFROTC pre-
viously required.”

Three classroom hours of study a week with
leadership laboratory is not required for those com-
pleting the summer camp.

Students applying for the two-year program
must qualify on the Air Force Officer Qualifying
Test, pass a medical examination, appear before
an interview board and successfully complete the
six week training course in the summer.

Students with four trimesters remaining before I

graduation must apply in 435 CL for an interview
with C01. Tinsley before February 15 in order to
enroll in the fall progam.

Freshmen presently enrolled in AFROTC can"
either continue with the old four year course or.
l1'0D It and enter the two-year program when they

re juniors.

Col. Hollis reports that the Army ROTC pro-
gram is still in the formulation stage and the details

are not available at present. The program will be

Pitt’ News Previews

By BARRY SHAW

John Pritchard will return
to the podium this week-end,
for the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony at Syria Mosque,
along with the distinguished
Russian pianist Yakov Zak,
to perform Rachmaninoff’s
“Fourth Piano Concerto” and Si-
belius’ “Symphony Number Two.”
The concerts will be performed
Friday night and Sunday after-
noon. I

As in all music of the Roman-
tic. -_ era, ethnic inﬂuences, and
therefore the" performer’s back-
ground, will play a considerable
role. . In the Rachmaninoff Piano
Concerto one can look for a com-
petent performance by Zak, prob-

however, is his more lyric mo-

so one should also look for a
heightened sensitivity on the
part of Zak. Phrasing, continuity,
and-. national, spirit‘ will be key
words in this piece.

For the Sibelius “Second Sym-
phony,” the location will switch
to Sibelius’ homeland, Finland.
As with the Rachmaninoff, Sibeli-
us’ nationalism. necessitates a
performance that will permit it
to simply glow. Copying his fa-
mous “Finlandia,” Sibelius creates
sevenal melodies and perfectly
orchestrates them to ﬁt his mood.

ments, Sibelius uses the full or-

one is not swept away by the
glory of it all, once again’ Prit-
chard will have failed.

As with Rachmaninoff, the al-

Fraternities Sign Up Rushees at IF Smoker

By FRED FRANK

Ninety-three rushees turned out Wednesday night for
the Interfraternity Council smoker, the first event of formal
rush. Rush will last until January 24. '

Central Rush Chairman, Ken Frederick, of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, predicted that 20 more men would sign up for rush
sometime during the next Week. Any rushee can register
in the Dean of Men’s office until 5 p.m., January 20;" There

was a 36-man increase over last year’s winter rush registration at

the smoker.

Frederick said that a questionnaire is being sent to all fratern-

ities concerning winter rush.
possible for the fraternities. Some

pretty strict changes will be in--

volved,” commented Frederick.

He predicted that next year’s
winter rush, which now lasts a
week and a half, will be cut
down to six days. Frederick ex-
plained that none of these changes
would affect fall rush.

Parker Enwright, assistant dean
of men in charge of fraternities,
emphasized the rushing regula-
tins at the meeting with the
rushees before the smoker. Alco-
holoic beverages, including beer,
are strictly prohibited in any re-
lationship between fraternities or
fraternity men and rushees at
anytime during the rush period.
Also during rush there will be

UNION BO/l\RDi  

 

 

In a great, growing university, it is sometimes necessary to cut corners. ‘In a

llgreat, growing university that programs an expansive Knowledge Availability Center to

increase the storage and transference of library. materials, therefore, it is sometimes
necessary to cut corners by shortening library hours. This follows logically.

Last Sunday University students found the Reserve Book Room on the sixth ﬂoor
of the: Cathedral closed—the only part of the library previously open on Sunday. Not
only this, the sign read, but Friday hours have been shortened -to a 5 pm. closing in-
stead of" 6 and Saturday opening from 8:30 a.m. to 9. _ '

Dean Lancour explained the regretful situation to us in what has become a hack-
neyed expression: shortage of funds means shortage of staff, so we have to cut the num-
ber of hours to the bare necessities. He said they were trying to work it out so that the

library could remain open on Sunday, that the library personnel were as concerned about

the situation as we were or they wouldn't be in the business.

But when it was suggested to himlthat students could work for lower wages to
keep at least the Reserve Room open, he spoke of responsibility and the number Of b00k.S'
on the shelves, and said he thought he could work out the problem within his staff.

_ We are not so idealistic as to ignore the ﬁnancial element of this problem. ,But
we have the right to expect that our educations here be supplemented be adequate library
facilities. And facilities—be they the ﬂoors in the Cathedral, the Knowledge Availability
Center, or the much-praised Hillman Library- to-be are not adequate if they are not open.

The students are not merely complaining; they are offering to help. Several people
have told us that they would be more than happy to work in the Reserve Room to keep
it open; but, in line with Dean Lancour’s statement, one co-ed reports that the library has
not requested any help as yet from the Student Employment Service.

The budget area of this University has interesting values when it comes to cutting
corners but oddly enough the students are beginning to tolerate this and are trying to
attack the problem from another angle. This is their education; their sincerity should not

be ignored.

Someone has to Take Out the Garbage o o o  

The Pros of Pledging

 By Fred Frank

Well someone has to take
out the garbage; thereis a lot.
of things to be done at a
fraternity house, just like at
any home. And most of the
time its the pledges who do
it. But pledging really isn’t
all that bad. I went through
it for four months and be-

A . lieve it or not I found I had

not descended into an inter-
minable hell. I think it was
a «constructive four months,

as a matter of fact. Con-

structive? How, you ask?
Well to my mind, it taught
me to be a fraternity broth-
er. -

Like most freshmen, 1
found rush the best of all
possible worlds. If I wasn't
being Ehauffered over to
somewhere on North Dith-
ridge or North Bellefield for
lunch, it was a dinner-dance
at a downtown hotel or a
country club. What a life to
be a Greek, thought the
rushee. All I have to do now
is decide where I want to

' V. pledge.

P L E D G E ! ! “Pledge,” I
shout out as my body is cov-
ered with a cold sweat. Ah

 "forget it, going Greek isn’t
K worth all the stuff I’d go

through _ during pledging.
I've heard about it. Well,

 - ‘there was that frat that

makes its pledges jump off
the Panther Hollow bridge
while the brothers watch.

  And only last summer I
heard rumors about another

one that sent ﬁve lamented
“members - in - training” to
the county morgue. Any fra-
ternity makes your life a
living hell for the whole tri-
mester, I decided.

NOW I speak after a lit-
tle more experience. I some-

 _ how, took a deep breath, mus-
: ._ tered all my courages and

    
  
 
  

accepted a bid from Zeta
Beta Tau despite all my

,; A manifold fears about the
. .  consequences.

At my first pledge meet-
ing it gave me a rude shock
to learn that I wouldn’t be
asked to learn my big broth-
er’s' uncle’s second cousin’s
grocery list, or do any of the
other “educational” tasks I
I had heard about. They did
ask me to learn most of the
fraternity’s chapters across
the nation. I came to realize
to be an effective Greek you
have to have those facts at
your command.

That was the easy part
of pledging. The rest of it
was hard work. At lunch
everyday one of my pledge
brothers and I had the sa-
cred duty of taking out the
garbage. But the brothers
themselves had taken out the
garbage during rush when
there weren't any pledges
around. Sunday afternoon
was the time for pledges to
cleanup the house. When I‘
was finished carrying down
mattresses from the third
floor to the basement “rat
room,” my ever present pres-
ident was there to teH me to
varnish the woodwork, clean
out the fireplace, mop the
kitchen floor, wash the dish-
es from the party the night
before or, as ever, take out
the garbage.

I DIDN’T really mind it —

all. True, I was pretty sore

after I had carried down

those ten mattresses single
handed. But while I_was get-
ting sore, I was also improv-
ing the appearance of my
fraternity house.

The same sort of house

work was my duty during .

“Help Week,” the final stage

of pledge ‘training.’ But be- "

fore I could become initiat-
ed as a brother, there was
“Hell Night” on the road
ahead.

I was not beaten with a
cat of nine tails nor did I
loose my right eye and arm,
as some would make you be-
lieve. I was probably more
tired than I'd ever been be-
fore in my life and I didn’t
exactly look like I was ready
for the Symphony Ball. But
as long as I live I will never
forget that night. When it
was all over I realized I had
earned the right to be a
member of my fraternity.
And I would never forget
how I earned that right.
Pledging was constructive, I
will always say even though
my arms are still sore as I
type out the words. It teach-
es you about your fraternity.
It gives you duties that help
keep your house operating.
Moreover, it gives you the
chance to earn something
that good looks, a pretty sis-
ter or money in your parents
bank account can't get for
you.

a Two Students

Defend Prof

Editor, The Pitt News:

In reply to a letter by Miss
Ani Freedman published on Jan.
11 we feel that we must defend
an irresponsibly attacked pro-
fessor.

It seems that Miss Freedman
considers herself  example of
the growing intellectual and emo-
tional maturity of the Pitt stu-
dent body. She claims that a
university professor has babied
her with intellectual pablum and
bored her with a statement of
disicipline in his class.

Letters to   the Editor

We should like to remind her.

that to grow in intellectual ma-
turity one must grow in intellec-
tual discipline. For any school to
attain Ivy League status, the in-
dividual student ’ must retain a
basic respect for an instructor's
ideas and methods whatever they
may be simply because he is a
‘teacher. Without an inherent
sense of disicipline and respect
for a professor, intellectual ma-
turity deteriorates while emo-
tional immaturity advances.

If Miss Freedman had been
listening instead of talking in
CL-G024, she would have realized
that the professor’s rules of dis-
cipline were nothing more than
what was expected of her in any
class. If she had given the course
a chance she would have been
told that the answers to the mid-
term and the ﬁnal would not be
spoon-fed to her as she claims.

If she would have given time
in her evaluation of the man
she would have discovered a pro-
fessor primarily concerned with
his student's individual problems.
But instead by her display. of
disrespect, Miss Freedman has
insulted .a man of integrity by
publishing a hasty judgment to

"appease an immature whim.

We think that perhaps Miss
Freedman is ll coward (as she
suggested in her letter). If she
is going to leave this university
and if the university’s fate means

little to her. than she should so ,

 

 

with  due speed butlnot 
Ztroy a_' _man’s career inlthe pro-
cess with a, letter sent in spite.

Self-discipline in the classroom
leads to intellectual discipline
and to intellectual maturity and
to a great university. Otherwise,
a potentially great university
student body will ﬁnd themselves

utterly dead from the neck up. t

Coed’s Letter
Called Unfair

Editor, The Pitt News:

In the Jan. 11 edition of The
Pitt News, a co-ed wrote a letter
labeling one of her professors “A
Tyrannical Prof.” This professor

is undeserving of such a title. 3
He has earned his Ph.D. degree, 

and certainly the right to disci-
pline his class. The conduct of
many students here is disgusting,
or as this instructor put it: “The
students are too big for their
pants.”

If Pitt is v“to attain reputation
of an Ivy League college,” it can
not do this through its physical
plant alone; its students must
contribute to this honor.

Perhaps this ﬁfth grader, rather
sophomore, should take a copy
of The Pitt News with her to her
new college to remind her that
she is no longer dealing with
elementary students and teach-
ers, but with honored professors
which only distinguished univer-
sities can attract.

As for his going out of his way
to help students by his personal
interest in their note taking, the
young lady could only deem this
fairly if she were in the class at
present: possibly the ﬁrst period
and one-half .aren’t enough by
which to judge the entire course.

Only when the students learn
to respect their professors will
Pitt truly achieve the status of
“a Great University.”

Name Withheld

(Editor’s Note: The term “ty'ran--

m'ca.l Prof” was not used by Miss
Freedman, but was written as a
headlme by a Pitt News staff

The greatest advantage under

indicated, would probably be that
students have two years to think
over entering AFROTC. He said
that many students don't enroll
in the course because as fresh-
man they are either unsure or
have overloaded their schedule
so they can't.

The two-year program has a
few hitches, Col. Tinsley stated.
It can hinder the accelerating tri-_

   smug llCadetI-Ioolpsters Host
  Panther Cagers Tomorrow

. » ' Another away game is on
‘ the agenda for the Panthers
tomorrow night as they meet
«the West Point Cadets in the
USMA Field House. The ca-
dets sport an 8-5 record go-
ing into the game. _

Army is led by high scoring
Mike Sulliman and guard
Captain Joe Kosciusko. Silliman
is the center for the Cadets and
leads the team in scoring and
rebounds. He is big at six foot
six inches and weighs 230 pounds.
He knows how to move under the
bank boards.

In the game against Army at
the Fitzgerald Field I-Iouse last
year, Silliman gave the Panthers
a lot of trouble with his big
sweeping hook shots. The Pan-
thers managed to win that gam
however, 86-84. ‘

’ Kosciusko is the Cadets’ de-
fensive specialist. He usually
guards the other team’s best
scorer. He was also second in
scoring behind Silliman last year.

The Panthers, now 3-6, hope
to break their losing streak at
three. The statistics show why the
Panthers have been disappoint-
ing so far this season.

The Panthers have taken more
shots than their opponents yet

’ ‘have hit only 36 per cent of their
attempts. Their opponents, how-
ever, have connected on 41 per
cent of their shots. The Panthers
are also only averaging 67.5
points a game while the other
teams are scoring 75.6 points.

Bob Lovettis leading the" Pan- ‘

thers in scoring, ﬁeld goal per-
centage, foul shooting percent-
age and rebounds. He is aver-
aging 16 points a game and has
pulled down 80 rebounds.
Larry Szykowny is averaging
15 points a game, Daryl Ruby, 11,
:and Dave Blyshak, 10. All the
other players are below ﬁve
points a game.
_ In the press box at the West
Virginia game the Army scout
mentioned another one of the
Panthers’ problems. “They never
_ seem to get the second shot,” he
said. -
Last years team had top re-
 bounders like Paul Kreiger, Brian
'Generalovech, and Dave Sauer,
while this season Bob Lovett and
"Jim Lavalley are carrying the

1 load. Both are averaging under
ten rebounds in game.

 I;Upper VVeigl1ts5 if C

By BILL CABIN

Weakness in the upper
weights hinders the wrest-
ling team when they wrestle
at Syracuse tomorrow. The
upper weights include the
167, 177, 191, and heavy-

weight divisions.

Matmen To Meet

George Huson, a 167-pounder,.

lost to Michigan’s Dave Post, 10-
4, last week, and faces an experi-
enced Lou Roberts at. Syracuse.
Lee Hall is the matmen’s best

wresler in the heavier Weights,‘

having an undefeated dual meet
record lastyear and a Win against
Michigan’s Tony Felock this sea-
son. ‘

Hall, however, meets Syracuse’s’

sophomore star ‘Tom Chlendorf . .
in the 177-pound‘ match. Chlen-..

dorf. currently rates as the best
177 pounder in the East, having
defeated Navy’s Jerry Franzen
twice this year. Franzen has been
the 177-pound division champion
in the East for the last two years.

“He’ll have to be up for that
match,” said coach Rex Peery.
“Chlendorf has to be good in or-
der to beat Franzen twice.” Chlen-
dorf edged Franzen in their ﬁrst
meeting, but beat him 8-4 in
last week’s meet. .-

The big problem in the upper
weights is the 191 and heavy-

  

   

  

   

 Big match'__u2it_h _ChlendofI‘f

weight divisions. ‘Bill ~Bodle and‘

Bill Beck are the only wrestlers
Peery has at these weights, and

neither has ever had a winning’

season. Bodle lost his match last
week-to Bob Spaley in the ﬁrst
period.
Possible Catastrope

Tomorrow could be catastroph-
ic ‘ in ’ these divisions. "Syracuse’s
Gerry Everling (191) and Jim

‘Nance (heavyweight) are the top

wrestlers in the East in their re-
spective divisions. “If they have
Everling and Nance, they’ll be

 

Syracuse

tough,” said coach Rex Peery.

Although Peery is undecided
about who will wrestle at 191 and
heavyweight, his only choice is
between Bodle and Beck. “I'll put
in the manager before I'll for-
feit a match in those divisions,”
said Peery.

The matmen’s outlook in the
lower weights is somewhat better.
“Our boys are tougher in the up-
per weights,” said‘ Syracuse coach
John Carlin. “Six of the seven
wrestlers we have available in
the‘123‘}to 157 class are sopho-
mores.-

Tom Heniif, at 123, and Dino
Boni, at f _137, both won their
matches against Michigan, and
Peery felt’ Frank O’Kor_n and Tom
Baily ' should have won their

0 .matches,- “We should have also *
‘WOD the 147 H and 157 pound

matches,” _ he said... O’Korn was
even with his man, but lost on
riding‘ time in the ﬁnal period,
and Bailey was reversed and pin-

ned  the first period. .

Although Peery indicated ear

lier this week that Mike Johnson’
might wrestle within the next
two weeks, he now says, “Johnson
will not wrestle against Syracuse.
I’ll have to wait and see before
I decide when to use him.”

able starter in the 130-pound di-
vision against Syracuse’s Terry
Hays.

Ohio University faces the swimming team tonight at

8:00 p.m. while at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow the University of 1

Indiana swims against the Panthers.. Both meets are sched-

uled for Trees Pool.

Ohio Coach Fletcher Guilders expects his team to be
better balanced and generally stronger than last year’s team
which finished second in the Mid - Amerlcan Conference-

Returning for the Bobcats is

Grady calls “a good medley man.-’?_

 Guilders will ‘have itwo; all- «

American sophomores: Rick Skar-
bo, ,“a real good back stroker”
in Grady’s estimate, and George
Saladana to go against the Pan-
thers tomorrow.

Grady considers Ohio and the
Panthers “pretty closely match-
ed” but says he doesn’t know
how many freshman he (Coach
Guilders) is bringing in” from
the 1964 squad.

The swimmers might beat Ohio
but will have trouble with In-
diana. Indiana, ranked as the
second. best team in the country,
was number one in the Big Ten
Conference last season.

Sprinter Bob Williamson and
Trahem Ogilby, middle distance
swimmer, head the free style
group. Long distance stroker
Jerry Verhoeven and Scott Cor-
din bolster them.

line-up.

The Panthers started the sea-
son with 15 varsity swimmers
and now are down to 13 because
of the academic problems of diver
Don Hahnfeldt and Richard Long-
phre. With the departure of
Hahnfeldt, the diving event falls
squarely on the shoulders of co-
captain Ed Coleman.

Trouble with Foes

By TOM SACKS

The gymnastics team has had little trouble in Winning
its ﬁrst two meets of the season over Slippery Rock and
Massachusetts but the competition from here on in willbe

among the roughest in the country. I l
, In the‘ next four meets, they will face, starting with

Syracuse tomorrow, Penn State, Army and Springfield.
Army, perennially one of the top teams in the country lost

by over 30 points. «

The Nittany Lions travel to
‘Springfield this weekend and the
victor will probably end up the
season with the Eastern college
title. 1' M A ~

His routines, though, in the last
two meets have been shaky and
disappointing. I

“Perez is still real good,” said
Neiger. “Remember he had a
wrist iniury and a. sound wrist
is essential in gymnastics.‘ Be-
sides the lack of practice time
has hurt him.” —

The performances of two sen-
ior specialists — Tom Misage on
the horizontal bar and Roland
James on the side horse —— will
also ﬁgure heavily in outcomes of
the remaining meets. I

The future record of the gym-

Neiger prior to the season, in- -
