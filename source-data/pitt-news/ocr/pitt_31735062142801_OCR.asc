A‘  .Next Friday evening, December 13, the Engineering and
‘Mines cabinet’ is sponsoring a_. dance. Traditionally, this dance
. was a f‘closed” affair. This Year, because of the lack of all-
VUniversity dances, due to the power and hotel strikes, E & M
has “opened” its dance to all schools of the University.
Pittites appreciate this gesture on the part of the E & M
cabinet. The sale of tickets, however, has been limited to in-
sure the social success of thedance.

There is only one discordant note in the plans for the dance.
V.'T.he coinniittee has decided that the dress for the evening shall
"be semi-formal. This decision, in the minds of many men as

well as women students, is a bit “high—schoolish”——an attempt
to appease both sides, perhaps~—those who wish to Wear formal

There have been Pitt women, some dates of engineers and
some not, who have decided that, if the dance is going to be
semi-formal, the Women are going to go semi and let their
dates go formal. Although this decision may not be “according
‘to Hoyle.” it is not as silly as it sounds.

Ifthe semi-formal plan was formulated tosave money, then
let ’s allisave money. If clothes are hard to get for men they
“are equally as hard to get for wome'n.

What the majority of students wants, E & M, is a de-
cision one wayjor the other. If the clothing situation is bad
and prices too high then let’s do without our formal dances.
If you want to bring back the old-time, big-time college dance,

Editor, Pitt - News-:

I would like to take this op-
portunity to express through ‘your
columns the thanks of the mem-
bers of the Penn State Blue Band
for the courtesy shown them by
those members of the Pitt Band
who served as their hosts this past
weekend. I believe a third of our
oﬂicial party was taken care of in
the homes of Pitt land members
anc‘; in some of the fraternity
chapter houses.

Needless to say, it woulr have
been difficult for the Blue Band
to make the trip had it not been
for the gracious cooperation of
these students.

I should also like to add my
personal thanks to them and to
Mr. Arthur and Mr. I ce for tak-
ing care of the arrangements.

Yours sincerely,

Foreign Students
Form Club Here

The possibility of forming a
club for foreign» students at Pitt
is developing into a reality with
the announcement of the ﬁrst
meeting of the Cosmopolitan club.

Frans Roes, special student from
Holland and instigator of the club,
has set -December 10, 6:30 p. m.,
and room’124 Cl as the time and
place ‘for the first meeting. An
informal meeting was held last
month to discuss the possibilities
of such a club, and all factions
were highly favorable with the
idea. There are 51 ‘foreign stu-
dentsrat Pitt.

The Cosmopolitan club is an in-
ternational organization, ‘but has
never been represented on Pitt
campus. Preliminary discussions
will involve ways, of adjusting
new students, the knowing and
understanding of relations be-
tween countries, and,,,corrobora-

tion with existm’ g‘ g'aniz’a‘tions.

We think that this business of
“cute” names for dances hit an
all-time high (or low) in the Tri
Delt affair, called the Gobble
Hobble. How jazzy!

Thanksgiving day produced
more than its share of romantic
notes. Brothers Norm and Harold
Weissman placed rings on the
ﬁngers of Jackie Green and Ruth
Weinstein, respectively-. Also,
Nancy Ann Porter and Ray Roolf
gulped out their “I do”s’.

The Delt formal took the cake
——1itera11y. Gil Marhoefer donated
it, a yard-square pastry, with the
names of the DTD pigskin play-5
ers plastered all over the top.

Charlie‘Reed and Vonnio Stone

music together and not a’ single
sour note so far. »

Reshuffling of Men’s Glee club
officers, brought about by the res-

manager, places that job in the
hands of Bob Calhoun, former

Student Critic
Pans ‘Kilroy’

by Bill Catrow

Pitt Cap and Gown (emerged
Wednesday, night apparently stlil
groggy after four years of en-
forced hibernation. “Kilroy is
Here,” the 35th production since
Cap and Gown was organized in
1908, was nothing if not a dis-
appointment to the small opening
night audience.

An involved plot, weakened by
script that lacked punch as well
as local humor that consistently
failed to raise a chuckle, served to
make -the production a gloriﬁed
talent show rather than a musical
comedy.

The inherent shortcomings of
plot and script kept the production
from being a memorable success.

The performance of the cast in
general and of several individuals
in particular was the show’s re-
deeming feature. , ,

Ted McCurdy, portraying an
ex-Corporal searching for a USO
girl who captured his heart in the
Paciﬁc, highlighted the shows with
his tenor rendition of “It’s a Love-
ly Day to Fall in Love,” a new
ballad by Norman Reis and Max
Adkins. ,_ .

The novelty team of Bill Zeﬁiro
and Jack Douthitt took down the
house with their slap-stick‘ har-
monizing and. antics reminiscent
of vaudeville.

, Overcoming the handicap of
poor lines Dick Hazley, as a weal-
thy manufacturer of corn plasters,
Jack Abramson, as the inventor of
singing commercials, and Elliot
Katz, as Kilroy, a Swede with an
Irish brogue, managed to save
their parts from oblivion by su-
perior acting. , A

The routines of the all—ma1e

highly entertaining as the tempo
varied from bouncy burlesque to
native war chant to country coun-
try club swing. A

The scenery was well planned
and appropriate. The musical di-
rection and accompaniment of
Max Adkins did credit to the well-
known maestro. - -

The show has all the indications
of improving with each succeed-
ing performance as is often the
case with collegiate theatricals.
Improved lighting and spots ,7 fol-
lowing the people who are‘ being
featured will do much to bring out
the genius of many of the special-
ty acts, and discredit the opinion
of many “ﬁrst nighters” that Cap
& Gown did not return with all
the ﬂourish that had been.expect-
in particular was the show’s re-
ed.

chology in modern medicine by
enumerating the speciﬁs cases in
which the two ﬁelds work to-
gether. , '

Speech Prof‘
Lauds Casts A

by Buell Whitehill, Jr. _
Assistant Professor of Speech

It was nice to have Cap and

Gown back again Wednesday
night. It was nice and even a bit
nostalgic to watch the old pattern
emerge. «And this time it was
pleasant to see a more intimate
show, in Foster Memorial, on our
own campus.

In fashioning “Kilroy Is Here,”
G. Norman Reis has written a
rather complicated. thing about
some Gooks who return from
the Paciﬁc and get the hero in
wrong‘ with his girl. He has
also added some action and gags
about a booking agency, but don’t
let that bother you, because it
doesn’t interfere with the musical
numbers, and everything turns out
all right in the end anyway.

Max Adkins and his two-piano
team have done a ﬁne job of
blending the music into the pro-
duction, and he and Reis are re-
sponsible for most of the‘ original
songs. I particularly liked their
“It’s A Lovely Day To Fall In
Love.” Wilbur Hansen’s “Looking
At The Moon” seemed a superior
number, too, and I was sorry it
wasn’t featured more.

Among the performers who
seemed to me to have a particular-
ly ﬁne musical comedy style were
Maurice Braunstein, Jack Abram-

Cap and Gown Reopens after Four Years

son, and Arthur Cicero. Ted Mc-
Curdy’s singing and general atti-
tude did much, to give the show
authority. ,The tape and ballroom
dancing of Perry Jubelirer and
Ken Phifer livened the second act
considerably. And the old, ﬁve-a-
day routine which Bill Zefﬁro
and Jack Douthitt ‘have worked
out is practically perfect and
something you shouldn’t miss.
The chorus is generally ﬁne, at-
tractive, and unbelievably viva-
cious. They enjoy themselves,con-
stantly, and they really distinguish
themselves in the jungle. number

‘Based on Chapel Windows’

“One Elect of Stars,” fourth in a) series of anthems inspired by

by Theodore M. Finney, professor of music. ' i V

Based on the theme of the “Come All Ye Faithful” window in
the Heinz chapel the words of this anthem like the others were writ-

dent in the Bureau of Retail Training.

Two of the anthems, “O Lord,¢
In Thee Have I Trusted”, based

on the “Te Deum Laudamus”
window and “Exultant Spirit”,
written on the theme of the

“Hope” window, have been pub-
lished as part of the University’s
choral series by Volkwéin Broth-
ers of Pittsburgh.’

“Before I have them publish-
ed,” Mr. Finney said, “I first have
a few copies lithographed from
the manuscript and give each
anthem a tryout with the Chapel
choir to make sure it produces
just the" effect I want.”

Mr. Finney’s latest anthem,
“One Elect_oi’ Stars,” is in litho-
ographed form and is being work-
ed on by the chapel choir. His
third, “You Gave the Gull Its

window, is still to be tried by the
choir.

Mr. Finney, who has been at
the University for 11 years, has
also arranged music for the Pitt

this fall. “I am greatly impress-

Chem Students
Sign Up New

For Courses

To avoid repeating the con-
fusion of September’s registration,
the chemistry department"is ar-
ranging a pre—registration this
month. Upperclassmen, especially
seniors, were unable to get suffi-
cient credits in chemistry for
graduation because of the large
freshman enrollment which closed
almost all sections. «

This pre-registration applies on-
ly ‘to students already registered
in chemistry courses or to those
who couldn’t enroll in required
courses during the current or past
semesters becouse of closed sec-
tions. Included in this special reg-
istration are students who signed
lists at the chemistry headquarters
in September indicating the cours-

S es they wished to take next year.

Beginning Tuesday, December
10 until Thursday. December 19,
students will register in room 208,
Alumni Hall, from 1 to 4:30 each
ai‘te1*noon.

Fr-aternities
Adopt Child
War Orphan

Over 100-O fraternity members
became the “proud poppas" of one
child last week. A check for $180
did the trick.

Some time ago the .'nterl’ra-
ternity council received a letter
from the New York oﬁice of “The
Foster Parent Plan for War Chil-
dren” asking the fraternity men
at Pitt to adopt a war orplian that
has two strikes against him be-
fore he starts. The I3 active men’s
fraternities contributed a total of
$180 for the benefit of a war child.

One child will be chosen by the
Foster Parent Plan committee as
the direct charge of the Pitt men.
In the near future the council ex-
pects pictures of their adopted
child, and in not too many years
a thriving correspondence is ex-
pected.

Rather than ask for a child of
a speciﬁed age and sex, the IF
council suggested that the most
needy youngster be given the aid.

Perhaps an early registration
for the class of 1960 could be ar-
ranged, or at least fraternity rush-
ing could be advanced to include
prospective students.

ed out completely. These forms
will be kept by the chemistry de-
partment until spring registration.
At that time, the department will
exchange them for class cards.

Any student who hopes to take
undergraduate chemistry courses
next semester should report to
this pre-registration.

Science Group

X—ray department at the Univer-
sity and Dr. Earl A. Gulbransen
of the Westinghouse laboratories
are presiding at meetings of two
national scientiﬁc societies which
began yesterday. and will continue
through tomorrow.

The scientiﬁc groups are the
Electron Ixlicroscope Society of
America and the American So-

fraction. ‘*1 ,

Through Dr. Si<lhu’s efforts in
the last nine, years, Pitt’s X-ray
lab has been built up to one -of
the best in the country. He is a
graduate of Pitt, and the only
X-ray physicist in this district.
Dr. Sidhu has published many
pers in the X-ray ﬁeld.

Dr. Gulbransen, also a Pitt grad-
uate, 'has been associated with
the Westinghouse laboratories in
the ﬁeld of electron diffraction.

The meeting will bring to the
Pitt campus representatives of the
country’s leading ’laboratories.
“The ﬁner structure of
as revealed by X-rays, electron
diffraction, and the electron mic-
roscope” will be the main theme
of the meeting. I

Pritch likes both classical and
popular music. He enjoys 85 per
cent ‘of his classical repertoirs,
but his favorite composer is
Chopin. In the popular vein he
likes particularly Honeysuckle
Rose, It Had To Be You and Star-
dust. He promises to perfect

melodies half way round the

more common plays.

those days one of the most popu-
lar plays_was the “ﬂying wedge.”
With ten men forming a “V” and
the eleventh member of the squad
lugging the ball in the middle,-the
team roared down the ﬁeld, slam-
ming aside anybody who dared to
get in their path. Today, this play
is outlawed for reasons of safety,
even though the modern gridder
is encased in scientiﬁc equipment,
instead of the paper-thin uni-
form of yesteryear.

Rough as those early footballers
appeared to be, they were not
lacking in manners. For one of
their tussles in 1904, the varsity
invited 20-0 PCW students. The
girls declined the offer, but wrote,
“we’re just crazy to atten-d.” They
certainly would have been. ‘

Men To Attend
Y Assembly

Pitt is one of 20 schools to ex-
hibit a program laboratory. Ex-
hibits of books, pamphlets, posters,
and charts that Pitt YMCA ‘and
YWCA‘ have used will be dis-
played to give assembly delegates
ideas for their own schools.
Speakers at the assembly will
include Charles G. Bolte, organ-
izer and ﬁrst chairman o-f the Am-
erican Veterans committee; How-
ard Thurman,‘ on leave of absence
from Howard university "where he
is Dean of the Chapel; and Albert
Outler, associate professor of The-
ology at Yale university.

Pitt fans of 1900 Watched a much diﬁferent game of foot-9
ball than the thousands who jam the Stadium today. They were
not at all amazed when a tackle pulled out of the line,
snatched the ball from a back and lumbered into the end zone
for another Pitt score. The tackle-around was one of their

Rules, too, have changed. In .

The Pittsburgh Post recorded
the interest in the games with
descriptions like this: “In-a period
of absentmindedness, a rosy-
checked girl beat the person in
front of her over the head in her

frenzied excitement.” Apologize?‘

No! . . . It was a great day for
Pitt.

When the Pitt Alumni meet to
talk football, there are incidents
that they like to recall; others
that they are still trying to for-
get.

Many remember with pride the
ﬁrst great team from Pitt, the
Panthers of l904.'Their undefeat-
ed season’s total of 384 points was
startling in that they only received
five points for a touchdown and
had «to cross " the goal with an
enemy punt to register the extra
point.

The. very mention of the name
of “Pop” Warner touches off a
volley of comment about Pop’s
greatest team. They were the
gridders who.rolled through four
seasons without a tie or defeat

. marring a string of 35 contests.

PCW Girls Shun 1904 Pitt Game;
Admit Just Crazy to Attend

A journey back into the 1890’s
is never relished, for at that time
Pittsburgh football was just be-
ginning and their gridiron ﬁghts

usually ended in defeat. Their.

particular nemesis was W .& J,
over whom they could not score a
victory until 1901.

Those Pitt teams, that played
shortly after the turn of the cen-
tury, founded two traditions that
have generally held true through-
out the years. The one was Pitt’s
ability to win the opening game
every year from 19-05 until 1940.
The other was the annual battle:
Pitt vs. Penn State. The fact that
Pitt met State again this year
p r o v e s conclusively that this
lengthy rivalry still exists.

Y Five in League.  

The Pitt branch of .the YMCA
announced today that they have
entered a basketball team in the
Metropolitan YMCA League. The
loop is made up of squads rep-
resenting the various YMCA’s of

‘ Allegheny county.

Practice for the Pitt entry will
begin next week.» All those in-
terested are asked to sign up
with Chris Lucey in the Y oﬂice
immediately.

PROS CAN THANK PITT

Much of the credit for the brilliant upsurge of the Pittsburgh
Steelers this fall’ can be attributed to the predominant Pitt element

in the local pros. In addition. to head coach Dr. John B. (JOCK)

Sutherland, bows are in order from his ﬁne staff of assistants. Frank
Souchak coached the ends, while Johnny Michelosen and Mike
(Nicksick) Nixon tutored the pro ball carriers. The three are former

Pitt gridders.

On the playing roster, there were a total of ﬁve men who had
seen action under the Blue and Gold banners before joining the

Steelers. Ralph Fife, Pitt’s last all—American, and —-———--h-
Fran Mattioli of last season’s Jungle Cat line,
alternated as starting guards. Elmer Merkovsky _
spent a great deal of time in the Steeler’s forward 
Wall and Bill Dutton ﬁlled out the left-half post. -
Ernie Bonelli, another halfback, spent a short _
time with the club.

End coach Souchak, incidentally, has been in
newsprint a great deal this year, outdone only by
“Jabbering John L.” Lewis. In addition to his grid-

the better district golfers with some excellent ‘tour-
ney play this past summer. Souchak also serves
as an officer in the Pitt Letterman’s club.

ONE GUESS GOOD AS ANOTHER

Following the close of any football campaign, the all—American
and all—opponent teams persistently begin hitting the sport pages.
This year is no exception. A recent all-East -squad, selected by As-
sociated Press, named Bob Plotz, Bill McPeak, and Bill Abraham, all
of Pitt, as honorable mention candidates. Plotz was chosen on the
West Virginia. all-opponent’ eleven. Leo Skladany was so honored
by Marquette while Jack - Durishan and Bernie Barkouskie were

picked by vanquished Penn State. A
