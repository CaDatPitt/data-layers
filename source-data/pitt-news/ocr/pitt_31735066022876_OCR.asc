Anti-Draft Movement

By SETH H. LUBOVE

Pitt News Staff Writer V
A scattered crowd of more than
500 anti-draft supporters in the

wake of an April 29 Senate Appro-

priations subcommittee passage of
President Carter’s plan to register
young men for a military draft,
gathered on Flagstaff Hill Saturday
for a rally and concert. '
‘The crowd was noticeably less
than last year’s rally, where att/en-

-dance was estimated‘\by the

organizers to be between 1,000 and"
1,500 people. A few of the demon-
strators at this year’s _ rally were
especially’ enthusiastic, _carrying
signs reading “The. Draft ls
UnAmerican,” and chanting “No

Draft! No Warl,”- while enjoying"

-the music of area folksingers Ann
Fenni and Tom Hoffman," Artie
Tedesco, and local rock group
“Prowler.”

Indications of flexibility in
rewriting the "proposed Student
Media and Publications Board con-
stitution arose Wednesday at a
meeting between the chief editorial
officers of three of thevfour media

' groups, the account executive of

The Pitt News, media advisor Larry
Lunsford, and director of student
activities, Andy Smith.

In the second meeting between
the two groups, which took place in
Smith’s office in the -Student
Union, discussion centered on the
make-up of the board, and a possi-
ble compromise was reached on the
selection process of the chief
editorial officers for the recognized

While speakers during the three
hour rally on the grassy hill between
‘Carnegie-Mellon University and
Pitt urged young people to fight the
draft as being unnecessary and a
prelude to war, a clean-cut group of
disciples from the Unification

‘Church of the Rev. Sun Yung,

Moon appeared and started heckl-
ing the first three speakers with

‘ shouts of “UnAmericans,” while
“Soviets

carrying signs reading
Love Anti-Draf ,” and “No Draft,
No Defense, No Freedom.”

When questioned about their
motives behind the counter-
demonstration, one of the Moonies,
a young black woman, said, .“we’re
here to protest the anti-draft move-
ment. We love America and we
don’t want to see it overthrown by
the Soviet’Union.”

However,.the hecklers did not go

unchallenged. The famous labor ‘

student media.

According to the proposal of the
officers in attendance, the staffs of
the various media groups would
hold regular elections for their chief
offices, and then submit the win-
ners of these elections as “recom-
mendations” to the board for ap-
proval.

If the board rejected the staffs’
choices, the rationale behind the re-
jection would have to be submitted
to‘ the staff .in question. '

However, in arriving at the com-
promise of editorial selection, a
number of disagreements arose con-
cerning the make-up of the board.
These were concerns about the
number ,of students who would

. have a vote on the new board. and

London Police Storm ln

By The Associated Press

LONDON—British commandos
stormed the occupied Iranian Em-
bassy at dusk Monday, killing three
of the five Iranian Arab terrorists in
a‘ gunﬁght after the invaders killed
two of their 21 hostages, authorities
reported. V

They said some of the 19 rescued
hostages suffered shock and cuts.
At least two explosions rocked
the elegant five-story building as the
Special Air Services .commandos
charged in. A fire followed but it
was soon extinguished.
Metropolitan Police Commis-
sioner Sir David McNee said two
terrorists were captured alive, but
one was wounded. V
He said the decision to storm-the

embassy after six days of tense
negotiations was made when the
gunmen killed two of their captives
and threatened to kill another one
every-half hour if their demands
were not met. ’
The-_gunmen seized the embassy
Wednesday and said they would kill
all the hostages if Iran’s revolu-
tionary Islamic government did not
free 91 imprisoned Iranian Arabs.

Arabs form an ethnic minority in
Iran’s oil-rich Khuzestan province
and their militants have been wag-
ing a hit-and-run war for autonomy

Khomeini’s government had

Iranian'Foreign Minister Sadegh
Ghotbzadeh told Tehran radio~Sun-
day: “If Britain declares that it
cannot do anything, then we will
start taking action.” -

He also was quoted as saying

“tens of thousands of Iranians” liv-‘ ._

the embassy unarmed. . .and mete
out the rightful punishment to those
mercenaries of Iraqi B_aath.”

He referred to Ira'q’s Baath

police entered the scene and made
assurances that the Moonies
wouldn’t cause any violence.

Some of the speakers condemned
registration for the draft as futile, in
light of the probability of the use of
modern nuclear weapons that
would be used in any future conflict
between the United States and
Russia. »

“The draft and registration for
the draft is particularly useless,”
said Monsignor Rice, “because no
modern war is going to use large
masses of soldiers. . .male or
female.”

Others questioned the reasons
behind the current conflict in the
Persian Gulf area, focusing their at-
tacks on the multinational corpora-

tions and large oil companies, with-

one speaker calling it “a drive for
profits.”

“The draft is an ill wind that
blows no one except those who in-
tend to profit from this war,” said
Tom Onieal, head of Pittsburgh
CARD and person responsible for
obtaining a permit from the city for
the day's rally. '

“President Carter should be as

considerate of the lives of young
people as he is for oil rights,”
Onieal later added. V-
“ ‘‘It’s a lot easier for these big
corporations to whip up patriotism
and send us to war,’.’ said Bob
Anderson, a Vietnam, veteran and
member of the group Vietnam
Veterans Against the War.

 
  

  

 

Students don’t'
economics lecture to know that
spiraling inflation fueled by ‘sky-'
rocketing oil prices affects their
lives daily.

They feel the pinch every time
they buy a new record or tape—or
for that matter, any petrochemical-
based product.

Life on a tight budget, fixed in-
come or part-time job can further

.. magnify the problem. Today, even

the smallest record or tape library
and most modest stereo system
represent a” considerable invest-
ment.

But, according to Memorex

‘manager of audio development

Fred Sischka, students can protect
this investment with minimal care

_ and a few simple precautions:

Records

0Keep them clean. Many record
cleaning devices, such as
specially designed soft-bristled
brushes are available. Clean
records sound better, last longer
and subject the stylus (needle)
to less wear.

0Keep them away’ from direct
sunlight and other sourcesrof
heat. Records are being made

need an a

care For Records Worth The Trouble  

thinner and thinner. Tempera-
tures as low as 80 degrees can
warp them permanently.

0Store records vertically. Pres-
sure created‘ by horizontal
stacking can warp records at the
bottom of the pile.

0Whenever handling ‘ records,
touch only the center label and
the outer edge. Natural skin
oils are harmful to record
grooves.

Cassette and 8-Track Tapes
0Keep tapes well away from mag-

netic fields produced by house-'

hold items like televisions, loud-
speakers and magnetic doorlat-
ches. These can produce aud-
ible swishes or complete
recording erasures, depending
on the amount of exposure.

0Tapes stored in cars or vans
should be kept away from -heat
and direct sunlight. Cassette
and cartridge shells can be
warped by excessive heat expos-
ure.

,0Dust, dirt and sand are harmful
to

internal moving parts.

\ I

     
 
 

\

Always keep‘ tapes in storage
albums when not in use.

0Excessive humidity is also harm-
/ ful to tape. Always store tapes
in a dry spot.

0If cassette tapes come with hub
locks, use them. They prevent
tape from unwinding during
storage,‘ which can "damage
tape.

Tape Recorders

Sischka says tape heads should
be cleaned at least every 30 to 40
hours of playing time. Several
cleaning aids are available commer-
cially. They range from easy-to-use
head-cleaner cassettes and car-
tridges to more sophisticated tape-
recorder care kits. He advises
following deck-manufacturer cau-
tions to avoid damaging tape heads
whenever performing routine'main-
tenance.

“Proper care of records, tapes
and recorders is easy and pays big
dividends in better performance
and longer, more enjoyable use,”
says Sischka. I

“Capitalism is in a crisis
worldwide,” Anderson continued,
“the third world is rising up. .-.so
they’ve got to whip up this
chauvinism . . . about Iran. ’ ’

“What kind of lies are they tell-
ing us about Iran?” asked Linda
Norquist, a steel worker and union
activist and member of the National
Organization for Women. “One
thing about Vietnam we learned is
you can't believe the government.”

“The draft is against me, it is a
threat to my personal liberties,”
said an emotional Ann Morton, a
teenager from ‘Taylor Allderdice
High School in Squirrel Hill.

“A draft would limit my individ-
uality. . .the war limits my in-
dividuality. I resent being moved
around
chessboard.”

However, Morton drew the most

‘response when she said, “young

people are considered the people of
the future, so why let the people of
the past make us kill each other in
the present?” '

The crowd at the rally—a few
veterans of the sixties’ demon-
strations, but mostly draft
age—'were content to lay in the
warm sun_ in cut-offs and halter
tops, and cheer the speakers or sing
along with the musicians. An
occasional shout of ‘ “no one for
president!,” could occasionally be
heard. '

Members of CARD sold buttons
and T-shirts to fund their rapidly

' declining budget, with such logos as

“Join the Army-travel to exotic

‘distant lands, meet exciting,
unusual people and kill them,” or
“STOP THE DRAFT.” Active
games of Frisbee occupied some
people, while othersdrank beer and
wine, or smoked marijuana.

Local political and lobbying
groups were also in attendance, set-
ting up tables on the grass and dis-
tributing literature or hawking
newspapers.

An Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA) group was there, publicizing
their May 10 national march for
ERA ratification in Chicago, pass-
ing A out applications, for bus
transportation.

The Communist Workers Party
had also set up a table, raising a red
banner, and the Pittsburgh Young
Socialist Alliance were present.

Petitioners gathering signatures
for the presidential candidate,
Barry Commoner, who is running
on the Citizen's Party ticket, walk-
ed along the hilside asking people if
they were registered voters in
Allegheny County, then gave a
pitch for the signature.

Towards the end of the rally,
around 3:00 p.m., Tom Onieal led a
mintue of silent prayer in memory
of the tenth anniversary of the Kent
State shootings where four students
were killed ‘while protesting the
Vietnam war. Flagstaff Hill was
silent, save for the barks of a few
dogs and conversation between two
Frisbee players who were unaware
of Onieal. ‘ ’

Bodies Of Servieemen

By The Associated Press '

Iran turned over the bodies of the
eight U.S. servicemen Monday to a
Greek Roman Catholic archbishop
in Tehran who said he would take
them to Switzerland the next day
for return to families in the United
States, Tehran radio said.

In London, policestormed the
Iranian Embassy, ending the six-
day occupation‘ by Iranian Arab
’gunmen., Police said three gunmen
were killed, one was arrested and
one was hospitalized. The five
gunmen, who held an estimated 19
hostages at the embassy, belong to
the ethnic Arab minority of Iran’s
Khuzestan province. They" have

_been demanding the relase of Arab
prisoners in'Iran, but the Iranian,

government refused to negotiate.
The official Iranian Pars news
agency,_ menawhile, said a

“possibly American” helicopter_

was abandoned in the Iranian desert
Sunday after four of the aircraft
violated the country’s airspace. The
U.S. Defense Department denied
the report and said the abandoned
helicopter was one left behind in the
failed April 25 attempt to rescue 53
American hostages from Tehran.
Archbishop Hilarion Capudji,
who was accompanied by Swiss
Ambassador Eric Lang‘ and the
papal representative in Iran, Mon-
signor Annibale Bugnini, later had

high praise for Iran’s decision to-

return the bodies of the men who
were killed April 25 in the doomed
U.S. military attempt to rescue 53
American hostages in Tehran, Pars
said. . -

Capudji_ was quoted as saying he
was grateful for Iran’s
“humanitarianism” in handing
over the bodies. “The return of the
bodies. is a symbol of the sublime
spirit of Islam devoid of the
slightest political motivation.”

An earlier Tehran radio broad-
cast said Capudji would deliver the
-bodies to the Vatican. Capudji,
who spent three years in an Israeli
jail for running guns to the Palesti-
nians, has not been authorized to‘
act for the Vatican.

In Washington,

Lt. Cmdr.

‘Gorden Peferson of the Defense _
Department said “there has been no

American aircraft’ since the April 25
mission.

Peterson said the crew and
classified documents aboard the
abandoned helicopter were rescued
at the time but the helicopter was
not destroyed for fear it would call
attention to the rescue mission.

The news agency said there are
plans to transport the helicopter to
Tehran.

The day after the mission failed,
the militants who have held _the
hostages at the U.S. Embassy since
Nov. 4 said they were transferring
some of the captives to other cities,
but some remain in the embassy and
three others are still at the Foreign
Ministry. The militants added the
towns of Arak and Mahallat, about
.155 miles southwest of Tehran, to
the list'of eight places where they
have moved hostages. b

At exactly 36 seconds after 4:00
a.m., March 28, 1979, the time
bomb wentoff. The first in a series
of malfunctions at General Public
Utilities Corporation’s Three Mile

Island nuclear reactor had set.in, _

making history as the mostserious
accident in the civilian use of
nuclear power in the'United States.
And suddenly, as people listened
_,tp the radio bulletins and television
‘broadcasts ﬂooding the airwaves,
this island in the Susquehanna
River ceased to coexist in peaceful
acceptance with its _'Middletown,
Pa. neighbors. Just the opposite

from before, when the four giant _

cooling towers "had represented
monumental nuclear progress and
technology, they now loomed like
surrealistic monsters in a twisted
horror movie. , '
Middletown, Harrisburg, Her-
shey, and all the other southcentral
Pennsylvania towns were im-
mediately thrust into a near
catastrophic -panic. Governor
Thornburgh’s office became ﬂood-
ed with a -tidal wave of questions:
Should we evacuate?, Where is
safety? Are ‘schools cancelled?

reached, although it is still pending
approval by Vice Chancellor for
Student Affairs Conney Kimbo.
This brought the total number of
voting members on5the board down
to seven, and took the four chief of-
ficers off of the board.

This move would bring down the _

board’s total membership to one
more member than was" speciﬁed in
the old constitution for a total of
from
within or without the university
community, two students appointed
by the Student Government Board
and the student media advisor.

However, by taking themselves _

off of . the board, the editors
forfeited the student majority pre-
sent in the controversial proposed
constitution, sparking a surprised

What's the general status? _

And out of dire necessity came
the realization that an effective,
credible vehicle was needed to relay
accurate information to a public
which needed to make important
decisions in a time of crisis.

This vehicle, evolving out of the
Governor’s Action Center (.GAC),
would come to be known on April
3, 1979, as the Governor’s special

‘Rumor Control Center for TMI

problems, accepting the respon-
sibility of providing the public with
the most clear, precise, and updated‘
information available.

Therehad been a lotof misinfor-
mation being spread through. the
news‘ media giving conflicting

reports on the same situation, ac- .

cording to Charles Kennedy, direc-
tor of GAC, so the original 9 a.m.
to 6 p.m. phone operation was ex-
panded to a 24-hour hotline, and
the GAC intake capacity was in-
creased from six’ phones to 25
phones on April 3, 1979. ' I
“The reason the 24 hour hotline

was set up was to make sure there «

was one authoritative source. . .
giving a mound of information,”
Kennedy said in an interview before
a moot court_session at the Univer-

response from Smith. , ,

“You guys have stunned me,”
Smith said to the group, “I am very
disillusioned that you wouldn’t
want a student-run board. I ‘

“What I would have considered
to be instrumental, you donot want
representative on the board,”
Smith later added.

Media advisor Larry Lunsford
said the editors would probably be
“a lot better protected’? if they
stayed on the board. “You’d pro-
bably have a turn to the old board
of everyone fighting for interests,”
Lunsford commented.

This led to further discussion
concerning’ the appointments of
members to the board. In the old
constitution, the four professional
members, along with the student

sity of Pittsburgh Law School.
“The mairrthing was totmake sure
we were able to get the most reliable
information to the public,” he add-
ed. » . 1

In a sense, the role of GAC didn’t
sway greatly from its traditional
role as a governmental ombudsman
during the Three Mile Island crisis.
It was originally ‘set up in 1973 by
the Shapp administration, as a crisis
hotline center during Hurricane

‘ Agnes. t »
Since then, it has evolved into an

information bank and action line,
handling citizens’ complaints of the’
state government, with more than

, 60,000 calls yearly.

Kennedy emphasized that the ac-
tion center is an advocate" for the
citizen, and not‘ the government,
with their main policy of “seeking
out the truth.” ' ‘

“The GAC has a reputation‘ for
being independent. . .somewhat
anti-government," ’ Kennedy said.

But when the potential for

catastrophe increased on March 30’

at Three Mile Island with the large

uncontrolled- burst of radioactive '

gas into the atmosphere, GACtwas
forceto forego the action line aspect
(Continued on page 5)

representatives were appointed to
the board by the vice chancellor for
student affairs. In the new constitu-
tion, the four professionals are still
appointed by the ' vice chancellor,

but the two student representatives

would be appointed by SGB.

Karen Metzinger struck a note of
bargaining when she said she would
take herself, and the other editors
off of the boardif there was some
way she could review and have a
decision on the appointments to the
board.

“I’m saying I could take the
board as it is (without editors and
the student majority) if there was
student input into-the selection. . .if
and only if we can interview the
candidates.

“I don’t want to give up our sit,-

. ting on’ the board if there wasn’t an

 

 

THRE_E_MILE ISLAND NUCLEAR REACTOR

equitable process, ” Metz_i_nger'add-
ed, suggesting a method whereby
-the editors could submit their
recommendations to the vice
chancellor for approval.

Smith responded to Metzinger’s
suggestion by saying “nine times
out of ten”. the vice chancellor
would appoint the four profes-
sionals from the list of recommen-
dations given to him.

But as far as the two students ap-
pointed by SGB were concerned,

Smith pointed out that those stu-.
dent appointees were up to SGB, as.

requested by that ' organization

‘ when they released extra mor'1ey'to

the board received from the in-
crease in the student activities fee.

_“Indeed, one would hope that
the appointments of SGB would be

respective of the student body,”
Smith said. . ’

‘_‘SGB released a certain amount . .

' of "money to media ‘organizations -

with the understanding that two

SGB-appointed members would sit ,

on the board,” Smith added.

Later in themeeting, Lunsford
asked theeditors what they would
do if Vice Chancellor Kimbo did

not accept having editors taken off . j i I

possibility of having one member of
each staff‘ selected and placed ‘on
the board to replace the editors.

. The editorsvoted unanimously to

have one staff member selected and .

placed on the board, if the proposal
to remove the editors from the
board was not accepted by the vic
chancellor. ’

like Serbs and Croats, Slovenes and
Macedonians, Albanians and

measure would immediately deprive
Bucaram and other members of his

If enacted by the ‘legislature,

ramifications that,any action would
bring from the non-aligned and
Western nations, as well as an im-
mense resistence that would come
from the Yugoslav people.

The latter is exactly what- Tito *

prepared for and is one of the
reasons he refused to name a suc-
cessor ‘ as president. He, once
remarked that “Yugoslavia is a very
strong country. It .is a» very united
country withonelof the strongest

armies in Europe.” He said that he '

wasn’t afraid about the future of

his country following his death. ‘
The ‘Yugoslavian Army is the key

to what i‘ happens. The country

"possesses one of me strongest pro-

fessional armies in Europe and has
volunteer forces from workers in
the’ factories to students in the
schools. It is expected that every-
man, woman, and child in the coun-
try— would take up arms to defend
the nation against any intervention.
The leadership now, as devised
by Tito, rests in a governing com-
mittee whose members rotate so
that ‘all the country's eight pro-

time being. And as much as the
Soviets would like to return the lost
lamb to the flock, a confrontation
with the Yugoslavs would bring the
opposite effect that the Soviets
want from Tito’s death, and that is
unity. As long as both Wahington

Letter

Less Woi’ringFor Health Service Under New Triage System:

I am writing in response to the
letter about the Student Health Ser-
vice which appeared in the April 9
edition of The Pitt News. The letter
dealt with a situation in which a stu-
dent visited the health service on
three occasions, _each time to have a
short three-minute procedure per-
formed, and found she/he had to
wait about one hour to see the
nurse.

As chairman of the Consumer
Affairs Committee of the Student
Health Advisory Board, I have
found numerous complaints con-
cerning sirnilar situations. As a
result, last week I spoke with the

jority of Ecuadorians appear to
feel that the government of the
president has done nothing during
its first half-year in power. Carlos
Julio Arsomena, ex-president of
Ecuador, is one person who has
voiced this opinion about the per-
formance of Roldos.

“I do not believe that the admin-
istration can convoke any
plebiscite, and if it does convoke a
plebiscite to reform the constitu-
tion, a reform that is not approved
by the National Congress, the
results of the referendum will be
negative, ’ ’ commented Arosemena.
“If we exclude the principal figures
of the cabinet, whom are the only
people that believe the adminis-
tration has completed a program of
works, I believe that the majority of
the Ecuadorian people have other
criteria.” I

To answer this criticism, Roldos
and members of his cabinet con-

clinical coordinator of the student
health service, Dr. Close, about this
aggravating problem. Dr. Close
told me that this has been a problem
at the health service for some time
and that they have recently for-
mulated a possible solution. The
fine details of this solution must be
worked out before the new system
can be put into effect.

Under this new ' triage system,
which should be in full effect by the
fall term, students who come into
the health service with a procedure
that may only take five minutes of
the nurse’s time will be given an
appointment with a nurse.

tinually- cite the actions of the
government that they see as signifi-
cant.‘ Although some of the pro-
grams are laudable, these
measures——a school breakfast pro-
gram, development of a literacy
program, commencement of an
economic development plan, and
construction of roads and other in-
frastructure—are paltry when com-
pared to the almost insoluble pro-
blems of increasing urbanization

'and continuing underdevelopment

that Ecuador faces.

Roldos also has suffered pro-
blems becausesome of these pro-
grams are impossible to implement.

For example, the National Plan of"

Economic Development is based on
the premise that the government

can use revenues from petroleum '

sales to fund the program. Since
this income already is earmarked
for payment of the national debt

Through this, the student will not

have to wait a long time to see the
nurse for a short procedure. Fur-
thermore, students who have seen a
nurse and must return for another
short procedure (e.g. blood
pressure check, test reading, etc.)
will be given an appointment with

the nurse before they leave the

health center. Through ‘implemen-
tation of this new triage system, it is
hoped that the .time that certain
students spend in the waiting room
will be reduced. '

In the meantime, students should
take advantage of the best time to
see a nurse in triage. These hours

and regular expenses of the govern- ~

ment, the plan appears unworkable.

Now, the president isjrapped in a
corner from which he cannot
escape. After the National congress
rejects the amendments, Roldos
must call for a plebiscite, which’ he
cannot win. The loss of this
referendum then would strip the
president. of all his influence and
While the
Ecuadorian people await this out-
come, they must withstand two to
four months of political and
economic stagnation.

The commercial and industrial
sectors of the nation,never have had
much faith in Roldos, and his plan
for a plebiscite has destroyed any
confidence that existed. As a result

these sectors can be expected to’

keep their activities to a minimum
until the political situation is more
stable.

are as follows: 8-10 every morning
and 9-11 Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Friday evenings.
These are the hours which ;,are the
least busy times and thus, the best
hours for students to_ use the triage
system. V \

One should also be aware of the
fact that Dr.
administrator for the Student
Health Service has_ resigned. When
her position is filled, this procedure
could change . at. the new .ad-
ministrator’s discretion.

Maryland Captures EAIAW Track And Field Championship 1
  . ‘ At Pitt Stadium

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
Pitt News Staff Writer
Maryland outdistanced Penn
State and Rutgers to easily win the

‘Eastern Association for Inter-

collegiate Athletics for Women
Track and Field Championships

 if this past weekend at Pitt Stadium.

Maryland, sparked by four first
place finishes, captured the team
title with 108 points to complete a
sweep of both the EAIAW Indoor
and‘ Outdoor Track and Field

   chipman’s

By JOHNE'I‘TE HOWARD
Pitt News Staff Writer
.‘ When Roy Chipman first assum-
ed his post as Pitt’s head basketball
 coach, his chances of luring blue
chip players to Pitt in 1980 were

' H regarded as slim, at best.

The new coach’s initial recruiting

' campaign was supposedly impaired
"by a late start, poor basketball
facilities and the emotional after-
math of the Tim Grgurich resigna-

. tion. V '

' “We were given a built-in excuse
for failure,” said Chipman. “Peo-
ple expected us to do poorly
because we began so late in the
season.”_ '

g . Yet, after barelya month on the
job, Chipman last week cbmpleted
Pitt’s best recruiting effort in recent
years with the signing of forward
Brett Crawford and guard Charles
Williams. They will join earlier
recruits, forwards Clyde Vaughn
and Steve Beatty.

_“I think our recruiting went ex-
ceptionally well in the amount of
time we've been here,” Chipman
said. ’

And, on paper at least, all four
incoming recruits have the creden-
tials to back him up.

Crawford, a 6-7 forward, aver-
aged 22 points and 16 rebounds a
game for San Francisco’s Riordan

. High School last season. In add-
ition to being named to the All-
California All-Star team by Basket-

 ball Weekly, Crawford wasa stan-

dout performer ‘at Arizona’s

.prestigious BIC Tournament.
. Crawford is expected to compete
with Vaughn for the
1 . db S

ward-.

State, eventually declared in second
place after a scoring mix-up, ended
with 81 points, followed by Rutgers
in third with 70.

A total of eleven EAIAW records ’

fell in the two-day competition
which hosted over 650_.athletes from
80 schools competingfor team and

‘individual collegiate honors.

Maryland, one of the pre—meet
favorites, was led by outstanding
individual performances by Marita
Walton and Mary Walsh. Walton
won the shot with a put of 15.55
meters and set a new EAIAW
record in the discus with a throw of
49.66 meters, bettering the old

'. mark of45.l set in 1979. Walton is

a freshman at Maryland this season
and a possible member of the 1980
Irish Olympic Team.

Walsh won the 10,000-meter run
in an EAIAW record time of
34:16.35, shattering the old stan-
dard by more than 30 seconds, and
finished second in the 5000-meter
run with a time of 16:40.0. Other_
top ﬁnishers for the Lady Terps in-
cluded All-America Paula Gervin,
first in the high jump at 5-10‘/2,
followed by teammate Jalene Chase‘
in third with a leap of 5-6, and the
400-meter relay team which finished
second with a time of 47.0.

Penn State scored well in the
distance and jumping events
enroute to their second place finish
in the team standings. Mary Rowe:
captured the only first for the lady
lions by winning the 1500-meter run
in a record 4:20.33. Teammate

_Heather Carmichael finished se-

cond in 4:21.04.

Penn State also got second place
performances from Karen Krawlice
in the high jump and Debbie Lewis
in the 200-meter dash. Third place

Relay runners from Rutgers, Morgan

Athletics for Women Track and Field Championships held this past weekend at Pitt Stadium.

"I think our recruiting went very well. . . ”

The 6-5 Vaughn is noted for his
pure shooting ability and is general-
ly regarded as one of the top six
small forward prospects coming out
of high school this year. -'

Vaughn averaged 34.6 points an
14.5 rebounds a game last season,
leading New Rochelle High School
to the New York Section One finals.
The first team All-State perforriier

sank an impressive 71 percent from
the field last year and Chipman
believes Vaughn can help the Pan-
thers as a freshman with his outside
shooting ability.

“He’s definitely one of the best
high school shooters in the country,
said Chipman. “His signing adds
credibility to our program.”

 

   

iting o

Vaughn had over 100 college of-

State and Maryland competed inthe Eastern Association for Intercollegiate

fers before choosing Pitt over the
likes of DePaul and Syracuse.

Chipman is also expecting
Williams, a 6-1 guard from Cincin-
nati to meet the Panthers’ need for
outside scoring punch. Williams
averaged 26 points and 16 .rebounds
a game as a senior two years ago at
Forest Park High School.

Williams attended classes at a
junior college last year, but -sat out
the basketball season and comes to
Pitt with four years of eligibility in-
tact. Chipman called Williams “an
explosive player” with exceptional
leaping ability who can play either
guard position.

Beatty, a 6-9, 210-pound forwar.d
from Slippery Rock is Pitt’s only
' local recruit. He averaged 21 points
and 19 rebounds -a game for Slip-
pery Rock High School last season
and was named Honorable Mention

All-State by the Associated Press-

and the WPIAL All-Section 15
team.

Chipman said he -regarded Beatty
as “one of the best big men in
Western Pennsylvania” and “a
very good potential player,” but
added that Beatty probably needs to
gain some weight to be more effec-
tive in collegiate play.

Chipman just missed landing
Central Catholic’s Marc Marotta
last week after .the highly touted 6-9
forward narrowed his choices to
Pitt and Marquette. Marotta decid-
ed to go, away to school and chose
Marquette at the last minute, in
what Chipman termed “a very dif-
ficult decision for him (Marotta).”

Although Chipman said earlier
that he thought the late start didn’t
hurt his recruiting, he conceded that

Guidas photo

rt Needs No Excuses

“we might have had a better chance
at Marotta had we been here a few
weeks earlier.”

Chipman also said the condition
of Pitt’s Field House was not a fac-
tor that adversely effected his
recruiting. A local newspaper had,
reported that Marotta wanted to
know Pitt’s plans for refurbishing
the Field House before making any
decision. Chipman reaffirmed his
belief in the administrative support

‘ he expects to receive at Pitt, which

includes the plans for renovating
the Field House. _

According to Chipman, the $1.5
million’ plan for the facility includes
increasing the seating capacity from
the present 5,300 to 8,000 by next
summer, a basketball weight room,
re-done locker rooms and offices,
and the relocation of other selected
offices and personnel.

“With these changes and the in-
creased seating capacity, the Field
House will be comparable to any
college facility in the East,” Chip-
man noted. -

Chipman added that in the future
some “big” home games may be
shifted to the 16,000 seat Civic
Arena, "and attempts are being
made to slate major teams like
Notre Dame and Kentucky on the
Panther schedule.

Chipman, who is operating under
a five—year contract, said he wants
the basketball program to be on a
comparable level with Pitt’s foot-
ball program and expects his Pan-
ther team to be very competitive-

top twenty and beyond—-within a’

four to five year period.

Pitt's ‘head basketball coach
Roy Chipman completed‘ his
full-time coaching staff by nam-
ing two young assistant coaches
over spring break. Joining the
Panthers are‘ Reggie Warford,
acting co-coach for Iowa ‘State
last season and Seth Greenberg,
an assistant at Columbia
University last year.

“Although they come from
diverse basketball backgrounds,

’ _ they both have had considerable

recruiting experience,” said
Chipman in making the an-

ly, they come to Pitt with strong
backgrounds in both academics
and basketball.” ' .

Warford, 25, served as assis-
tant coach at Iowa State the past
four years, ‘where he gained a’
reputation as an excellent
recruiter and coach. This past
January The was named acting
co-coach of the Cyclones when
head coach Lynn Nance resign-
ed in mid-season.

Bill Madlock Reoieves
15 Day Suspension 

By The Associated Press -
Pittsburgh Pirate third baseman

- Bill Madlock received the longest

suspension ever in major league

baseball Monday for hitting anum-

pire with his glove during a dispute.
A Pirate spokesman said Na-
tional League President Charles

_Feeney suspended Madlock for 15

days, effective Monday. That
means ‘Madlock will miss ll
scheduled games.

Feeneyialso fined Madlock a-
reported $5,000,, far less money .

than he’ll lose on -his estimated
$250,000 annual salary by missing
11 games. A «

The 29-year-old third baseman
immediately appealed through the
National League Baseball Players
Association, the Pirates said. ’

An eight-day ban against former
San Francisco Giants All-Star pit-

cher Juan Marichal had stood since .

1965 as the longest suspension for

After Hitting Umpire     

‘an on-the-field incident.

Marichal, who clubbed .Los
Angeles Dodgers catcher John
Roseboro over the ‘head with his
bat, was also ﬁned $1,750.

Denny McLain of the ‘Detroit
Tigers was suspended for the last
half of the 19.70 ‘season for gambl-
ing. ' ‘ '

Madlock’s punishment stems

from an incident at home plate ‘in-

    

last 'Thursday’s game with Mon-L

treal. .

Home plate umpire Jerry
Crawford called Madlock out on a
swinging third strike to retire the
Pirates with bases loaded in the
fifth inning. ‘ -

Madlock protested that he hadn’t'
- taken a full swing, and after getting

his glove from another. player,
pushed it into Crawford’s face.
Madlock and Crawford were then
separated by Pirate Manager Chuck
Tanner.
