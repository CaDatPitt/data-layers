For The Pitt News

Pitt graduate Marin Cogan, now
a GQ correspondent trailing the
presidential election, is a living
example of the value of the “out-
side the classroom” experience that
advisers across majors emphasize
for students.

During her time in the nonﬁc—
tion writing program at Pitt, Cogan
scored three internships that set
the stage for her success in jour-
nalism.

Cogan met Franklin Foer, her
future boss and the editor of The
New Republic, at a panel event
hosted by the University during the
spring of her sophomore year. She
made an impression, kept in touch
and later applied for an internship
with The New Republic in the fall of
her senior year. After graduation,
she landed a spot as a reporter-
researcher and later advanced to
the position of assistant editor of
the magazine.

“The internships I did in col-
lege enabled me to be able to get
hired for a job on my last day of
classes,” Cogan said in an email. “If
I hadn’t taken any internships, I’d
have spent my ﬁrst two years out
of college playing catch up with the
kids who had done internships as
undergrads.”

Tonight at 7:30 p.m. in the
Lower Lounge of the William Pitt
Union, Cogan will return to campus
— along with eight other profes-

ELECTION 2012

Green Party VP candidate reflects

Gideon Bradshaw
Staﬁ Writer

After concluding her remarks yes-
terday evening, Green Party vice
presidential candidate and longtime
activist Cheri Honkala paused as she
heard music from the doorway. After
amoment, she began playing avideo
featuring artists Lil Wayne and Emi-
nem from her smartphone.

“I listen to this almost every day,”
she said.

Honkala, who is currently run-
ning alongside Dr. Jill Stein on the
Green Party ticket, spoke with the
same informal style as she told the
audience of about 40, who came to
watch her speak, about her history
of activism and her thoughts on in-

justices in the United States political
system.

Originally scheduled for Tuesday
evening in Posvar Hall, the event had
to be rescheduled because Honkala
was unable to make the original time
slot after being arrested for disor-
derly conduct near the campus of
Hofstra University in Long Island,
N .Y., where last night’s Presidential
debate was held.

Her lecture, which the Depart-
ment of Sociology, School of Social
Work, Women’s Studies Department
and Political Science Department co-
sponsored, was moved to Wednesday
and lasted about an hour and a half.

Honkala described growingup in
Minneapolis, Minn., within astring of
state—run facilities after her mother,

the victim of domestic abuse, was
declared an unﬁt parent.
Although Honkala hadthe young-

er of her two sons, Mark, while she -

was still a teenager, she managed
to ﬁnish high school. But when she
lost her job and couldn’t afford to pay
rent, Honkala and her son moved

into a car.

After getting a ﬂat tire that crip-
pled the carinwhich she and her son

' were living, she said she moved into

an abandoned buﬂdingthat provided
warmth during the Midwest winter.
Fed up withthe limited prospects for
the unemployed like herself, Honkala
began tocall press conferences in

order to publicly request affordable

housing.
Because there were no cell phones

on life, activism

at the time, she remembered handing
her son handfuls of change to call
family friends on the pay phone in
case she was arrested.

“I didn’t know it at the time, but
what I was doing was forming”orga-
nizations,” Honkala said of her early
days as an activist.

Duringthe 19805, she and her col-
leagues, whom she characterized as
pioneers, began to use tactics such
as setting up tent cities and moving
families into abandoned houses.

Afterthese uncertain beginnings,
Honkala continued her work as an
advocate for the homeless after she
moved to Philadelphia in the late
19805.

PANEL

sionals in the ﬁelds of publishing, newspaper,
digital journalism, public relations, television
and public radio — for a panel discussion
titled “Media Internships: Ways to Write for
a Living.”

The event is designed to teach students
what they need to know about obtaining in-
ternships. The members of the panel hail
from workplaces such as KDKA—TV, The C0-
lumbus Dispatch, Pittsburgh Business Times
and 90.5 WESA, among other media busi-
nesses.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette executive editor
David Shribman will moderate the event,
which will consist of a question-and—answer
session between himself and the eight panel-
ists regarding the ins and outs of internships.
Then the panel will take questions from the
audience, followed by a receptionLduring

which students will have’ the opportunity to

speak with the professionals. — V

“The panel was assembled expressly for
students who are looking for careers that
put their writing and liberal arts skills to
work,” Cindy Skrzycki, a senior lecturer in
the English department, said in an email.
Skrzycki both selected the panel members
and orchestrated the event this year.

She said that contacts made with panelists
in the past have landed students with posi-
tions at places like The New York Times, The
Denver Post, The Fan radio station and KDKA.

Caren Marcus, the English department’s

internship director, said this event will help
students learn about what’s out there, what
the possibilities are and what they have to
do to get an internship. She also stressed the
importance of bringing resumés.

“It’s critical to get your resume into the
hands of people who can help you,” Marcus
said, adding that the panel is just as beneﬁcial
for freshmen as it is for seniors. “[It’s] never
too late to get an internship.”

She said that students with majors such
as engineering and nursing have “clear- cut”

career paths after graduation, but English '

majors are “not so slotted.” Instead, their
“skills are transferable and valuable in many
different ways.” A

The event is not just limited to English
majors. Mark Kemp, an academic adviser in
the English department, acknowledged the
value in simply exploring a ﬁeld of interest.

“Many students need to test the waters,
discoverwhat they’re capable of, expand their

.experience,.learn what choicesjare available

and what great range of options exist beyond
the obvious and predictable,” Kemp said in
an email. “In today’s competitive professional
world, it helps all students to add some prac-
tical experience in the work world to their
education.” '

And this real-world experience has the
potential to lead to a career.

“Internships absolutely mean the differ-.

ence between getting a job when you gradu-

ate and not getting a job,” Cogan said in an
email. “I can’t see myself hiring someone for

a job in journalism who didn’t have any prior .

experience.” I

GREEN PARTY

In the mid 1990s, while living in a tent city
for the homeless in Philadelphia’s Kensington
neighborhood, she became concerned when
rats began to infest the encampment. The may-
or’s oﬂice and several progressive members of
the city council fueled her concern that the tent
citywould be looked upon as apermanent solu-
tion to its residents’ lack of permanent shelter.

So she and 70 homeless families marched
for seven days to the state capital, covering 22
miles per day. Honkala displayed a wry humor
about the journey.

“Yeah, we would have taken the bus if we
had $600 between us at the time,” she said.

Despite eventually getting evicted from the
Capitol rotunda after six weeks -of camping
there and later being removed from the steps
of the building, Honkalahas continued to lobby
against what she sees as the social injustice of
the American political system. a _ R

Before her current run for the vice presi-
dency, she ran for the ofﬁce of sheriff in Phila-
delphia. During her campaign, she promised
to prevent foreclosures ofhomes by deputizing
the neighbors of those families whose houses
came up for foreclosure. She said that under her

plan, these deputies would move the families’ .

possessions back into the homes.

“Do you know how popular Iwas in high-
foreclosure neighborhoods?” she said, asking
the audience rhetorically. “Quite popular.”

Honkala, who said that her own vision for
an ideal society included converting members

of the U.S. military into organic farmers and
forgiving all student loans, also said that she
believed that she needs such revolutionary
tactics in order to inspire the radical change
she expects. .

She said she believes that development proj-
ects in Philadelphia came from the efforts of
vocal activists like herself. Unorthodox tactics
such as moving families into Independence
Hall, she said, have proven effective in gaining
the attention of the city government.

At one point toward the end of her remarks,
she directly addressed the students in the au-
dience to tell them that she still felt optimistic
about the potential for change in the U.S.

“The glass is half ﬁillbecause people are get-
ting tired of the crap that’s going on in this coun-
try, and there are going to be some changes,”
she said. “And you guys will live to see those,
and that’s exciting.”

Russell Noble, a sophomore majoring in
philosophy and political science, said that he
enjoyed Honkala’s "remarks, although he regret-
ted that she did not speak on a broader range
of political issues. " if

“It would have been nice if she addressed
U.S. foreign policy  It would have been nice to
hear that the [Green Party’s] vice presidential
candidate has stances on issues that aren’t di-
rectly related to the environment or the housing
problem,” Noble said. .

Jackie Smith, a sociology professor who
helped organize the event, felt glad that the
event provided aforum for others to hear about
Honkala’s work.

“I know a lot of the story, so [Honkala] said
exactlywhati hoped she would say,” Smith said.

THE RIVETER

Gay blood just as good as straight

Rosie McKinley
Colummst

The year 1983 brought our nation
the moonwalk, the ﬁrst American
woman to travel to outerspace and
one of the most memorable NCAA
basketball ﬁnals of all time. Yet
these bright moments were over-
shadowed by the greater context
of a nation just beginning to fear an
incredibly horrifying, scientiﬁcally
confounding virus: AIDS;

The Food and Drug Administra-
tion’s ban preventing gay men from
donating blood was born during
this irrational age of fear. Now, as
America advances toward equality
for gay individuals both in marriage
and within society, the FDA’s ban is
merely an outdated policy contam-
inated by an infectious prejudice
against those who are gay. And it’s
time for the ban to be lifted.

In the nearly three decades since
scientists identiﬁed the human im-
munodeﬁciency virus (HIV) as the
cause for AIDS, the American public

has learned a lot about one of the .

most frightening health concerns of
our time. For one, we no longer re-
fer to it as a “gay cancer.” Yet despite
- a sizable increase in the general un-
derstanding and scientiﬁc advances
in regard to the treatment, testing
and prevention of AIDS, the FDA’s
discriminatory policy remains.
Blood donors are asked a se-
ries of questions to determine the
likelihood that viruses have con-
taminated their blood. Pitt students
who have frequented tattoo parlors
or studied abroad in places such
as Panama, where malaria is still
prevalent, are deferred from giving
blood for one year. Those who have
recently had heterosexual sex with

deferred for one year.

However, heterosexual students
who have simply slept with half of
the students in their History ofjazz
lecture or who have asexual partner
for each ﬂavor of Mad Mex mar-
garita could give blood tomorrow.

There are no restrictions on people‘

whopracticeheterosexual, safe sex,
even if it’s with multiple partners.
Meanwhile, men who have had

A sex with other men —— even just

once ——, since 1977 are banned from
donating for life. That means the
FDA would rather take blood from
the guy who leaves Peter’s Pub with
a different girl every night than
from the gay person who’s been in
a monogamous relationship since
freshman year. Even people who
engage in other high-risk sexual
activity, like paying for sex, are al-
lowed to give blood, whereas gay
men remain banned.

If the FDA can allow those who
engage in high-risk behaviors -
like having multiple partners —
to donate because testing for HIV
has become so efficient, why can’t

they apply those same efﬁcient tests l

to the blood from gay men‘? Other
countries have. In places like Brazil
and the United Kingdom, gay men
can donate blood» if they have not
had a new partner within the year,
and in Spain and Italy, gay men in
monogamous relationships ca
donate. V g V
The FDA argues that gay men are
statistically more likely to test HIV-
positive than heterosexual men. So

are black women or residents of

Wash_ington,'D.C., where the preva-
lence of HIV—positive individuals is
comparable to some regions in sub-
Saharan Africa. Yet you wouldn’t see
a blanketban on African—American

area because it would be outra-
geously discriminatory.

Blanket bans like this are always
discriminatory because they gen-
eralize an entire population based
on the circumstances of a marginal
few. The basic failure of the FDKS
policy, therefore, is that it relies on
the misconception that homosexual
men are a homogeneous group.
They aren’t. ’

In this country, about 80 per-
cent of American gay men do not
have HIV. That means about 2 mil-
lion gay men are HIV—negative. In
fact, one 2010 study found that if
the ban were lifted, and gay men fol-
lowed the same donating patterns
as the rest of the population, over

130,000 healthy gay men would

likely donate each year. That’s why
organizations like the American
Red Cross are ﬁghting for the “dis-
crimination to end: They need the
blood to save lives, and to them, gay
blood is as good as any.

As evidenced by blogs and
students at a handful of colleges
throughout the nation, there is a
temptation to ﬁght this discrimina-
tion with a historically successful
tactic: boycotting.

But to boycott the blood drives
on our campus in the coming
months would be risking the lives
of hundreds of people who rely on
blood donation and are relatively
powerless in overturning the ban.
So instead of protesting by boycot-

ting, if you are eligible, take some V
time next week on Oct. 23 and do— .-

nate blood on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the
Union. While the FDA’s shamefully
discriminatory policy prevents our
healthy gay Pitt community from
saving lives, those who can should
still donate. I

an HIV—positive partner will also be women or residents of the beltway Write to ram132@pitt.edu

There aren’t many collages thatlcombine
the faces of Ronald Reagan, Osama bin

‘Laden and Freddie Krueger. But when

Will Steacy sought to create his monstrous
work, dubbed “The Beast,” it was clear he
wanted to make a statement.

Silver Eye Center for Photography joins
the election dialogue with “Nojob N 0 Home
No Peace No Rest: An Installation by Will
Steacy.” From Sept. 14 to Dec. 15, Steacy’s
170-foot collage will greet Silver Eye visi-
tors in the Main Gallery.

In the ﬁrst room of the gallery, the two

primary walls are covered with newspa-
per clippings, pop-culture references and
familiar faces. The other rooms feature
photographs by Steacy that are not in col-
lage format but still connect to the theme
of the American Dream.
“You look at it, and it’s the perfect title.
It’s massive: physically, intellectually and
artistically,” Tegan McDufﬁe, a student at
Carnegie Mellon, said. “It kind of reﬂects
how politics works, the dichotomy of his
set up. You have to take in the details, but in
doing so, you lose sight of the big picture.”
‘ McDufﬁe, a senior studying directing
and photography, heard about the exhibit
from her professor Leo Hsu, one of its cu-
rators. McDufﬁe attended Steacy’s opening
night and visited the gallery a second time.
The collage displays a multitude of
events throughout American history, com-
mentated on by Steacy through various
symbols, images and words that he juxta-
poses with the clippings. There are some
repeated images, like that of a skull, which
he places on different bodies throughout
the collage. R

FILM REVIEW

‘Psychopaths’ makes screenplay commetary

Jeff Ihaza
Staff I/Vriter

“Seven Psychopaths”

Directed by: Martin l\/lcDonagh
Starring: Colin Farrell, Woody
Harrelson, Sam Rockwell
Grade: B+

Moviegoers familiar with the surreal and ab-
surdly violent world created in Irish ﬁlmmaker
Martin McDonagh’s 2008 ﬁlm “In Bruges” will
ﬁnd themselves quite at home with his latest
ﬁlm, “Seven Psychopaths.’’ ”

For those not accustomed to the director’s
ways, there is a bit of a learning curve.

The ﬁlm begins with a quirky line that in
many ways sums up the unpredictable oddities
that ensue: “Was it Dillinger who got shot in
the eyeball?”

In what feels like aﬂash, the ﬁlm descends
into unmitigated violence as it introduces the
audience to the eponymous seven psycho-
paths.

The plot isn’t entirely violent, though. Much
in the vein of meta ﬁlms like Charlie Kaufman’s
“Adaptation,” “Seven Psychopaths,” at its core,

is about screenwriting.

The ﬁlm follows Marty (Colin Farrell), a
struggling writer who prefers to get blackout
drunk instead of ﬁnishing any of his work and
ﬁilﬁlling his dream of ﬁnishing his screenplay,
“Seven Psychopaths.” Marty is best friends
with Billy (Sam Rockwell), an out-of-commis-
sion actor and dog thief who wants to help
Marty ﬁnd inspiration for his writing.

“Seven Psychopaths” provides a violent twist on screenplay writing. MCT Campus

But Billy steps on the wrong toes when,
without the guidance of his strangely religious
partner Hans —— hilariously portrayed by the
stoic Christopher Walken — he dog—naps a
shih tzu belonging to a ruthless psychopathic
gangster named Charlie (Woody Harrelson).

The two ﬁnd themselves in over their heads

The Lighthouse and the Whaler’s
sophomore album, T/air 2': an Adi/emtz/re,
was produced by Ryan Hadlock of The
Lumineers. The album sounds like an
endless summer day with the twinkle of a
glockenspiel, catchy guitar riffs and airy
vocals that make the music sound fresh
and almost innocent. The star tracks of
this album are “Little Vessels” and “Ven-
ice,” but if you like lighter, poppy folk
songs, the whole album will most likely
be a- treat.

_“Pioneers” kicks off the album as its
first track with winks of glockenspiel
and multiple layers of soft vocalyand gui-
tar sounds all working in harmony. The
music would be appropriate for afeel’-’

of youthful optimism. ‘

“Venice” is the true love song of the
album. The lyrics “And death is cold /
Death is sure / Why don’t we all fall in
love?” is accompanied by a deﬁnitive,
poppy guitar riff that feels like nothing
but the innocence and purity of first love.

The album brings listeners a nice, up-
beat feel that strays from more depress-

an overall happy one. I

‘PSYCHOPATHS’

when Charlie hunts them down in a fashion
akin to “N 0 Country for Old Men.” Marty ﬁnds
the perfect inspiration for his screenplay —
that is, if he can manage to stay out of the way
of the seven psychopaths determined to kill
each other.

The rather muddled plot carries alongwith

. the seemingly caffeine-induced rants charac-

teristic of McDonagh’s work. At random points
in the movie, characters break out into rousing
Ray Lewis—style speeches about completely
nonsensical topics.

Because of its plot and execution, “Seven
Psychopaths” should be another cult ﬁlm that
somehow ﬁnds its way onto everyone’s Nerf-

‘ lix queue, but “Seven Psychopaths” seems to

transcend this notion.

The movie’s best advantage is the com-
mitment of its truly star-studded cast to the
mayhem of the ﬁlm.

Farrell —— who looks like he’s in college -— is
at his best playing the drunken loon of a screen-
writer that in a lot of ways mirrors the ﬁlm’s
actual writer and director. The legendary Tom
Waits, a famous singer-songwriter, composer
and actor, even makes several appearances as
the ﬁlm’s ﬁfth psychopath, Zachariah Rigby.

Aside from its conﬁising — and sometimes
off-putting — plot and writing style, every part
of “Seven Psychopaths” is completely straight-
forward. There’s no pretense in the movie’s
craziness, and by the end, viewers feel right
at home amidst its psychopaths. I

“His work is about how bad things have
gotten for people in America,” Hsu said.
“He talks about how the Beast has arrived.
It is a horror.”

Hsu, an independent curator who also
teaches at CMU, explained that Steacy’s
work exempliﬁes the recession. Though
Steacy had planned to publish the collage
in a book, he agreed to display it at the
center in a single installment. The collage
will be available in book form within the
next month for. those who wish to view a
portable version as well. _

“He worked on this obsessively for six
to seven months. When I ﬁrst met him, he
was telling me about how it was two—thirds
done,” Hsu said. “When we agreed on the

sumed him.”

The timing of the installation is extreme-
ly relevant: The 2012 election season is in
full swing. Steacy’s installation demon-
strates the evolution of a nation where the
current economy has signiﬁcantly stiﬂed
the American Dream.

“He speaks very freely. He is not on ei-
ther side,” said Juliana Zipay, a member-
ship and marketing assistant at Silver Eye
Center. “You can see pros and cons of both
sides. He doesn’t afﬁliate with conservative
or libera .”

Zipay explained that the collage con-
nects with literary and pop—culture ref-

installation, he hadn’t ﬁnished. It had con- '

erences. The title even references Bruce
Springsteen’s song “The Ghost of Tom
Joad.”

Steacy incorporated photographs from
newspapers and other forms of media, as
well as some from his personal collection.

“Photography is so important in political '

situations,” McDufﬁe said. “A lot of lower-
middle-income Pittsburghers will see this

and get a lot of info. Numbers and ﬁgures

are really intimidating. Photos are more
direct at addressing issues.”

Steacy also incorporated excerpts from
his journal — a handwritten form self—ex-
pression against the text of newspapers —
in conjunction with the visual images. He
uses his own writing in_many of his other
pieces, continuing his family’s writing back-

ground, which consists of ﬁve generations '

of newspaper men.

.“His writings were most effective,”
McDufﬁe said. “We’ve seen newspaper clip-
pings and popular images. His writing is
more like rambling, more graceful than ad-
vertisements. It was a stable juxtaposition.”

Hsu explains that it’s not easy to inter— *

pret the photos on their own.

“The text of the collage offers a different
part of reality from newspapers. It’s more
tightly bound,” Hsu said.

“It israllegorical and descriptive, loaded
with symbolism. That is where we saw this
working,” Hsu said. “Documentary photos
have been mainly shaped bycontext. Just
photos would have been good, but this [in-
stallation] is precise.” I , -

you’re going to put on when you get there‘?
There are many important elements in-
volved in creating a memorable night
while tucked away in bed with your date,
but the most important of these factors
is your choice of tunes. Picking the right
set of tracks to set up the scene and carry
you through the night is key to perfecting
that night of passionate romance. The
right set of sexy tracks can help you lose
your inhibitions and keep the atmosphere
steamy. The proper seductive jams will

bring out the love machine within you.

The first step in compiling a proper c

playlist is the decision regarding what
mood to set for the evening. ‘Do you want
your night to be soft, slow and sensual?
Or is this a ‘wild one-night stand with the
bad girl of your dreams? Either way, your
first songghas to create the vibe you’re
looking for.

It’s about making that special some-
one you brought home with you feel like
they’re in for a wild ride while simultane-
ously smoothing over any bumps in the
seduction process. Consider the rhythm
of the bass line, the effect of the vocals
and the length of the song. Each of these
components plays a critical role. ,-'

Unless you’re a ’.7os sex symbol, avoid
cliche love tracks in this situation. Marvin
Gaye has a place in every sexy playlist, but
“Sexual Healing” has been used so often
that it might seem like a joke. I recom-
mend “Stroker Ace” by Lovage. Listen to
the song, and you will understand.

Once you’ve got your opening track
picked out, continuity becomes important,
so consider things like pacing and style.
Putting a track with harsh guitar riffs and
a choppy bass line into an otherwise silky

I smooth mix could be the ultimate mood
killer. If you’re doing it right, neither you
nor your lover will be paying attention to

the lyrics, so this is a good time to focus A

on solid songs that don’t really draw at-
tention to themselves. A

After a slow start to the 2012 season, redshirt junior wide receiver Devin Street (15) has responded with the best play of his career.
 Jihoon Baek | Senior Staff Photographer T

Brian Batko
Staff Writer

For the second game in a row, it seemed
like every time you looked up from your
computer, ce_ll phone» or nachos, Devin
Street was hauling in another pass from
Tino Sunseri.

And for the second game in a row, a
herculean effort by Street was overshad-
owed by what didn’t go right for the Pitt
football team.

An outstanding 10—reception, 130—yard
performance by the redshirt junior wide
receiver was lost in the Panthers’ dismal
14-13 defeat at the hands of Syracuse the

~ * - Friday before last. At the time, those 10

grabs were a career high — one that he
surpassed just eight days later in Satur-
day’s 45-35 loss to Louisville.

Street outdid himself against the Cardi-
nals, catching 11 passes for 111 yards and

_ W a touchdown in yet another impressive

outing ‘marred by an otherwise disheart-
ening defeat. ~
“I think the coaches are calling on me
to be a big playmaker, and they’re,deﬁ-
nitely trying to get me the ball and put me
in different spots, but 1 think with the big

”“" games, it’s not satisfying with the losses,”

the Bethlehem, Pa., native said following
the Louisville game.
Still, itgmust be nice for a player like

P Devin Street coming into his own on offense

Street —— considered throughout his ca-I

reer to be mainly a deep threat while fel-
low receiver Mike Shanahan did most of
the heavy lifting — to finally make the
pundits who predieted he would have a
monster season look smart. ‘

A quick Google search of the former
three-star recruit yields results such as
“2014 NFL Draft Scout Player.Profile”
and “Devin Street — NFL First—Round
Draft Pick?” .

“I don’t pay attention to it too much,”
Street said of all the hype surrounding
him prior to the season. “I just want to
go out there and play and give it all I can
and let that stuff fall into place.”

A trendy pick for preseason rankings
of top wide receivers and candidates for a
b'real<out year, Street is on pace to eclipse
1,000 receiving yards with 514 already,
at the halfway point of the Pitt season.
What makes this feat even more remark-
able is the rather pedestrian start with
which he approached the season; the
wide receiver held fewer than 75 yards
in each of the first three games, includ-
ing a downright atrocious season opener
against Youngstown State full of penalties,
dropped passes and a lost fumble late in
the. game. .

“I went back to things that were work-
ing for me last year. I tried to do some
different things mentally before the game
 and I learned from it,” Street said in

reference to his struggles throughout the

upset loss. “I think that was a great game

for me because it really humbled me.”

And so what was supposed to be a
breakout year for Street has become not
only that, but also a bounceback story.

In the last three games, he’s had 26
receptions for 336 yards and two touch-
downs. To be fair, a good chunk of Street’s
staggering numbers came on the ﬁnal
drive against Louisville with the game out
of reach, but the damage he did against
Syracuse occurred when it really mat-
tered.

Eight of his 10 catches came in the
first half against the Orange before, like
the rest of the Pitt offense, he was held
in check for most of the second half. And
he’d better get used to teams keying in
on him — he’ll no longer be sneaking up
on anyone considering that he’s already
noticed increased attention from opposr
ing defenses. '

“I see a lot of different looks. We’ll
come out in the ﬁrst quarter and see one
look and see what we watched on tape, but
then [the defense] will mix it up and try
to confuse me,” Street said. “But I think
our coaches do a great job of telling me
and communicating with me and then we
adjust to it.” I

NBA team

Nate Barnes
Staff Writer

It might only be the preseason with two
weeks remaining before the start of the

regular season, but I think it’s close enough ,

that I can start writing about the National
Basketball Association in my weekly col-
umn.

With the NHL season currently on hold,
there’s no better replacement than NBA
basketball until hockey returns.

City of Pittsburgh, hear what I say:

Pittsburgh should have an NBA basket- '

ball franchise.

Call me crazy -— you wouldn’t be the
first — but I think Pittsburgh would be a
great city for the NBA to move a franchise
from somewhere like New Orleans or Char-
lotte where the teams are not only losing,
but also hemorrhaging money.

The venue for a team is already in place,
with the recently opened Consol Energy
Centerbeing one of the nation’s premier
arenas. And beforeyou ask about how the
basketball team would share space with the
Pens, bear in mind that the Staples Center
hosts the Los Angeles Lakers, Clippers and
Kings —— sometimes on the same day -
and has absolutely no problems doing so.

But first, since ﬁscal issues seem to be
the topic at hand, the primary reason the
NBA should look into moving a franchise
to Pittsburgh is the single fact that all of
Pittsburgh’s professional sports teams do
very well ﬁnancially. This success is a tes-
tament to the Pittsburghfan base.

Everyone knows that the Steelers are
one of the league’s most valuable fran-
chises‘. In September, Forbes Magazine
listed the Steelers’ value at $1.1 billion
with a revenue of $266 million last year.

And the Pirates, who recently com-
pleted their 20th consecutive losing sea-
son, still manage to turn profit and draw
crowds; more than 2 million people at-
tended Pirates games this year. Forbes
lists the Buccos’ value at $336 million as of
March of this year and reports the Pirates’
value as having increased by 11 percent
since its last assessment. -

The Penguins in the Consol Energy Cen-
ter serve as the most comparable example

PITT IN THE NFL

Pitt in the NFL: Fitzgerald, Lee perform Well in losses

Sean Corrado
Stayj’ Writer

-Most of Pitt’s most prominent players lost

their games this past week, but their in-
dividual performances in defeat differed.
Here’s a look at how some of the 20 former

Panthers currently in the NFL fared this '

week.
Arizona Cardinal Larry Fitzgerald
played a pivotal role in his game on Sunday,

cutting toward the middle of the field and ‘

gaining an inch of separation from Buffalo
Bills linebacker Bryan Scott in the ﬁnal
minute of the Week 6 matchup. That inch
was all he needed to haul in a perfect strike
from back-up quarterback John Skelton
and convert a crucial fourth down for the
Cardinals. The completion set up kicker
Jay Feely’s 6_1-yard ﬁeld goal to send the
Cardinals into overtime, tied at 16. ‘
However, another Pitt alum, LaRod

V Stephens-Howling, dropped a screen pass

in open field on Arizona’s first overtime
possession. On the very next play, .Skel-

ton — inserted in the game after starter‘

Kevin Kolb left with a wrist injury — threw

an interception to setup Buffalo’s game-

winning field goal. .
Fitzgerald (Pitt 2002-2003) had a
strong performance in the loss with six

catches for 93 yards and a second— quarter
touchdown. Stephens-Howling (Pitt 2006-
2008), on the other hand, did not take
advantage of his first start of the season.
He rushed for only 22 yards on 11 carries,

while splitting touches with William Pow-
ell. Powell gained 70 yards on the ground
from his '13 carries. ' I
Because Stephens-Howling failed to
make a play in overtime, it now looks as

if Powell will receive most of the touches
from this day forward. Both backs are

av;

receiving more playing time, the result ‘

of injuries to starters Ryan Williams and
Beanie Wells.

Another former Panther running back
could not get it going in Week 6, and LeSe—
an McCoy’s Eagles lost 23-20 to Detroit in
overtime.

McCoy (Pitt 2007-2008) gained a sea-
son-low 22 yards on the ground with his
14 carries. He was also able to snag seven
catches for 26 yards and a short touchdown
near the goal line. The touchdown is his

2 second receiving score on the season. He

still only has one touchdown rushing.

C‘ also left the game brieﬂy with
an anltélie injury. He returned later in the
game, but since the Eagles have a bye week

coming up, McCoy will have plenty of time  .

to get healthy.

Jabaal Sheard (Pitt 2007-2010) and his
Cleveland Browns earned their first win of
the season with a 34-24 victory over divi-
sion rival Cincinnati. Sheard had two tack-
les and also batted down a pass at the line
of scrimmage. He combined with a strong
defensive line to force Bengals quarterback
Andy Dalton to lose a fumble, sealing the

of what a Pittsburgh NBA team might look
like. With the NHL’s recent resurgence,_
both the NHL and NBA are nearly identi-
cal on monetary and attendancelevels.
According to Forbes, the average NBA
team is valued at $393 million, whereas
the average NHL team at $240 million. But
the average yalue of NHL teams increased
by more than 5 percent over the past two
seasons, and the NBA’s high mark results

from outliers such as the Los Angeles Lak— '

ers (valued at $900 million) and New York
Knicks ($780 million).

Fan wise, most NHL and NBA franchis-
es attract between 16,000.and 18,000 fans
attending home gamesgon average, with a
number of teams in each league topping
the 20,000 attendance mark.

Television, an additional driving force
behindsportseconomics, makes Pitts-
burgh a viable option for an NBA fran-
chise. The market share is large enough,
guaranteeing proﬁts from the available
television exposure.

According to Nielsen television data
from Sept. 22 of this year, the Pittsburgh

sports market reaches 1,165,740 homes, or .

1.021 percent of all homes with a television
in the United-States. That number makes

the Pittsburgh market larger than those «

of 11 of the 30 cities currently support-
ing NBA teams, including New Orleans,
Memphis and Indianapolis.

Recently, the Los Angeles Lakers signed

a 15-year deal with Time Warner Cable
that will turn out to be worth roughly $1.8

1 million over the period of the contract.

Now I’m not saying an arrangement of
this magnitude will happen in Pittsburgh,
because it won’t, given that LA’s TV mar-
ket share contains more than 5 million
homes. But the potential to make money
from television coverage in Pittsburgh is
certainly present. -

Aside from the potential ﬁnancial ben-
eﬁts, the most compelling reason I feel an
NBA team would succeed in Pittsburgh is

' the undeniable presence of its fan base.

Basketball is becoming more popular in
Pittsburgh with the recent rise of the
Pitt Panthers, and games at the Petersen
Events Center sell out consistently.

Plus, we all hear about how the Pitts-
burgh fan base is one of the best in sports,
and that is evident not only in the Steeler
Nation and followers of the Penguins, but
also in support for the Pirates, whose fans
continue to hold on to hope for the’ Buccos
despite 20 years of anguish.

If an NBA franchise were to come to
Pittsburgh and, in its ﬁrst season here,
win a couple playoff games, that would
go a very long way toward ensuring'sus-
tainability of the team for years to come.

There it is, Pittsburgh. I know a lot of

‘arguments against the NBA claim that bas-

ketball “isn’t physical enough” and “no-
body plays defense,” but give it a chance.
I gave the NHL a chance last year when
the NBA had its lockout. A _

So return the favor, please. I

STREET

knows the caliber of player he has in
Street and doesn’t seem to be all that sur-
prised by the way he’s been frustrating
defenses for the past two weeks.

“He did some good things, and those
are things he should be doing,” Chryst
said on Saturday. “You don’t take anything
for granted, but Devin’s a talented player,
and heshould be impacting games.”

Street’s strong rapport with his coach-
es .isn’t the only reason for his recent suc-
cess. Despite the losing streak, his chem-
istry with Sunseri is as strong as it’s ever
been, and Pitt’s senior quarterback will
be the first to point out the emergence of
his new favorite target.

“I think he’s matured a lot. I think he’s
grown as a receiver and as a player and

understands that ﬁlm study needs to go
into it and the route study that needs to
go into it,” Sunseri said. “We’re talking
throughout the week, making sure we’re
communicatingand understanding each
other and just making sure we’re not sur-
prised by anything on the ﬁeld.”

For a guy that was once considered a
bit of a one-trick pony — perhaps remi-
niscent of the other speedy pass-catcher
in Pittsburgh with whom Street and his
Pitt teammates share a practice facility on
the South Side — the 6-foot—4 receiver’s
skillset is rounding into form.

Latein the third quarter of the Syra-
cuse game, Street snagged a pass on a curl
route toward the sideline and managed
to get two feet inbounds for an 8-yard
gain that looked more like a play you’d
see on Sundays.

Browns’ victory.

Kansas City wide receiver Jon Bald-
win (Pitt 2008-2010) only managed two
catches for 19 yards from backup quar-
terback Brady Quinn in a blowout loss to
Tampa Bay.

The Chiefs go into their bye week with
regular quarterback Matt Cassel cleared
to practice after suffering a concussion.
Maybe the extra week of practice can get
Baldwin and Cassel on the same page.

San Francisco punter Andy Lee (Pitt

2000-2004) tied his season high with four I

punts in a huge loss to the Giants. He nailed
all four for a total of 199 yards and pinned
one inside the 20-yard line. I
