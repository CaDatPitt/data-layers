THE UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

Comedy Planned As “Romp”

By” DAVE PATTON
“Weill play it as a romp,
‘more like a circus than a stage
play,” commented Michael
McHale, director of the Pitt
Players’ upcoming production,
“Taming of the Shrew,” which

will be presented tomorrow night ~

at 8:30 p.m. in the Stephen Foster
Memorial.

Subsequent stagings of the
Shakespearean comedy, ﬁrst to be
undertaken by the Players, will
be Friday and Saturday nights,
Feb. 15 and 16. ,

, Tickets for “Shrew” are now on
sale at the Student Desk for one
dollar. Special group rates for par-
ties of ﬁve or more are being

' offered and tickets for high school

students are priced at ﬁfty cents.
, Roving Troupe

In trying to dispel a common

conception that Shakespeare is

generally dry and boring, McHale

said the atmosphere of “Shrew” ‘

will belthat created by a “roving
Elizabethan troupe,” which will
inhabit the Memorial for the three
days at the end of the week. The
comedy will depend a lot on sight
gags and props, rather than tradi-
tional Elizabethan methods.

«— --«All told, the Players’ production

will be a contemporary interpreta-
tion of Shakespeare.

The 6B class of Wightman
School, Squirrel Hill, will be
guests of the University at the
Thursday night presentation.
Under the instruction of Mrs.
Jennie Strauchler, this class
studied “Taming of the Shrew”
recently. ‘

Running about two hours,
“Shrew” will be offered in its en-
tirety. An Elizabethan forestage
has been built over the orchestra
pit in order to bring the actors
and the audience closer together.
A small scene house will facilitate

“ “simultaneous presentation of adja-

cent scenes.

Dr. Peake Announces

NoV.2 For Homecoming

Assistant Chancellor of

Student Affairs, Dr. Charles

Peake, has announced that annual Homecoming is slated for

the week—end of the Syracuse game, Nov. 2. Highlighting the
traditional. Homecoming classic will be a ﬂoat parade 1n the

stadium at halftime.

The nature and types of events and activities for the

weekend will be determined by a9

special co-ordinating committee
composed of delegates of the stu-
dent body, alumni, and athletic
department. .

Student committee members
will be recommended by the SC
appointment committee. The func-
tion of this committee will be to
place all events in logical order
and to please the wishes of stu-
dents, alumni, and athletic de-
partment in- the homecoming
schedule.

In accordance with the prime
aim of homecoming, to cement
firm relationships .with returning
alumni, the policy making decis-
ions were contingent on several
factors.

It was necessary that the date

‘be, early in the year to prevent

C adverse weather conditions and

that the game would not be con-
gested by capacity crowds at a
crucial clash. , 

Debaters Triumph
In Mid-term Trips

During the mid-semester vaca-
tion, the Men’s Debate "Team en-
joyed its most successful series of
trips this year. ‘ .

On February 1, at the Univer-
sity College of the West Indies in
Kingston, Jamaica, Richard Cro-
mie, Col. ’57, and Bob Thompson,
Col. '57, comprising the ﬁrst team
from this state to engage in a
debate on foreign soil, soundly de-
feated the host team. They de-
fended the affirmative side of the
topic, “Resolved: That the British-
French invasion of the Suez was
unwise.” University officials term-
ed this one of the ﬁnest debates
ever «heard during the school’s
eight year existence.

Free Polio Shots

By JIM MARINO

Free vaccinations against

Polio will be given‘ to the

families of the faculty and employees of the University of
Pittsburgh according to an announcement by Chancellor Ed-

ward Litchﬁeld.
The shots will be given as

part of the University’s mass

inoculation program which includes all students, faculty

and employees.tUnder the pro—¢

gram all will receive the three
necessary shots free of charge.

First of the vaccinations will be
given on Feb. 27 and 28 and Mar.
1 and «2 in the Commons Room.
The plan is designed to set a pat-
tern for institutions across the
nation. Chancellor Litchﬁeld stated
the need for a “mass assault on
crippling poliomyelitis in this gen-
eration.” ‘

Nation To Watch

Therefore the attention of the
nation will be attracted to the
University by press and “television
coverage. It is essential for all the
students to take advantage of this
opportunity. 1

Later inoculations will follow

weeks and the ﬁnal booster will
-be given after seven months.
This program is a separate un-

' dertaking sponsored by the Uni-
versity. It is not part of the
Allegheny County p r o g I‘ a m
which was inaugurated at a
later date.

All students will be handled
without waiting during the inocu-
lation periods. A staff of five teams
of vaccinators will process 200
students an hour. Students under
21 will need their parents’ signa-
ture giving permission for the in-
oculation.

Committee Set

An Initiating Committee for the
distribution of the vaccine has
been set up by Theodore W. Bid-
dle, dean of Men. The faculty
representatives are: Dean Biddle,
Dean Helen Rush, Miss Dorothy
O’Connor, Dr. Robert Carlson, Dr.
Raymond Blackburn, Dr. Carroll
Reynolds, Professor William Ru-
doy.

Ordinarily we try to assign summer employees to work

with their long-range interests. Informal or formal instruc-
tion on Company matters is usually provided.

We’re deﬁnitely in favor of these summer contacts, for
they provide students with practical technical experience
and make them more valuable to industry when they
graduate. And it gives us a chance to become better

In addition to the Formal Technical Training Program,
we frequently have a number of vacation replacement ‘‘

Library Gets Spoken Records

Foreign Language,
Prose And Poetry,

Available on Discs

By VINCENT LOPRESTI
The spoken word has be-

come an integral part of Pitt’s
expanding library and‘promis-
es not only to ease the pain of
reading difficult material but
also offers sophisticated enter-

tainment such as Edward R.
Murow’s “I Can Hear It Now,”
and Arthur Miller’s “The Death
of a Salesman.”

The Stark Record Library, 10-
in the Aldred Room,
now contains over 150 “spoken
ranging from English
prose and poetry to complete

—. courses in foreign languages. The

collection is being enlarged from

_ day to day.

A new policy has been adopt-
ed by the library that now per-

mits students to draw out re- A

. cordings for a week at a time.
-Formerly, the records were not
permitted out of the Aldred
Room where two Hi—Fi record
players, equipped with ear-
phones, are. available for stu-
dent use.

The Stark Record Library was
presented to the University by the
Stark brothers, Pitt alumni. They
recently presented the University
with a grant of $10,000 to spend

I over the next four years for the

express purpose of building up a
collection of spoken records.
New Concept

Spoken records are a relatively
new concept in library technology
that has developed considerably in
the past 15 years. It was first
started by the University of Chi-
cago and’ Harvard who started
out recording important works of
literature both past and present.

 Poetry, which is meant to be

read’ aloud, was naturally the first
field to be treated, but in a short
time plays, prose, and even docu-
mentary records were made, and
today there are records for almost
every ﬁeld of interest.

In the Stark collection such
writers as William Faulkner, John
Steinbeck, and Robert Frost can
be heard reading’ their own works.
There is a long list of famous
speakers including Basil Rathbone,
Helen Hayes, Judith Anderson,
and several others.

Anyone who has read Ger-
trude Stein’s controversial “Por-

,, traits” will find that her poetry

was meant to be heard, not
read; her words may well be
meaningless, but the sounds and
rhythms of her poetry are sur-
prisingly pleasant and entertain-
ing when read aloud by the
woman who wrote them.

The above mentioned works are
only a part of the many records
to be found in the Stark collec-
tion. More than half of the rec-
ords deal with foreign languages.
There are audio aids in French,
Spanish, Russian, Chinese, and all
the other languages taught at the
University. The grammar records
are titled “Living French,” “Liv-
ing Spanish,” etc.  ’ 1

Complete Courses

They are complete language
courses in themselves and come
equipped with manuals for the
student to use as he listens to the
records. There are also many se-
lections reading the original such
as Dante’s “Inferno,” Virgil’s
“Aeneid,” and the more recent
works of M aupass ant, Camus,

A valuable trophy is missing
from the Pi Lambda Phi fra-
ternity house. The sterling-
silver Irma Weinthal trophy-
which has both traditional and
sentimental value to Pi Lams
and alumni of the group can-
not be found. A substantial re-
ward will be .presented to in-
ﬂividuals who supply informa-
tion leading to the return of
the -annual award trophy.

contacting Mrs. Helen Dice in the.

CAVU For USAF

By Jim Merino

This year marks the golden anniversary of mili-
tary air power in the United States. It is also
the tenth anniversary of the United States Air
Force as a separate branch of the service.

On August 1, 1907, a directive was issued for the

establishment of an Aviation Division by the Army A

signal Corps. Capt. Charles Chandler was assigned
to -the command post of the new
division. For two years, how-
ever, the new aviation division ;
was without aircraft, except for
a single Wright “Flyer” which
crashed shortly after purchase:
killing an Army lieutenant and =
injuring Orville ~Wright. '
In'1911, however, a genuine
industrial contract was signed
and Curtiss and Wright planes . ' *
were purchased for the division. Growth was ex-
tremely slow and the outbreak of World War I
found the United States’ well below the other

 

world powers, Allies and Axis in number of air-

craft, pilots and other personnel.
The air war in Europe was a story of ‘the

martyrdom of young ﬂiers to win airmindedness

for the upper echelons of the chain of command
Possibly because the U.S. was

administration and lack of progress in aviation
went virtually unnoticed. ‘

Seeds of War

So much was the nature and signiﬁcance of
aviation overlooked that the treaty. of Versailles,
the end of the war to end all wars, sowed the
seeds of the great air struggle of World War II.
The treaty allowed the German nation to con-
tinue building aircraft for “peaceful” use. No-
body, except a fewrankless airmen, realized that
by mounting a machine gun on its nose, a “peace-
ful” plane became a deadly pursuiter.

After the war, the Army planes were considered
practically worthless. A .ﬂood of surplus-aircraft

Cwas pushed dirt cheap on the public. This wave

of cheap aircraft all but drowned current produc-

International lLivinlg . . .

Expect   The

tion of planes.

As a result, when the Army was remobilized
in 1920 and the Aviation Service became a sepa-
rate corps of the Army, the equipment situation
was desperate. Still the only ones who recognized
the problem were the airmen themselves.

The one man whose rank and command of re-
spect made him the champion of the cause of
leading the administration into the light was de-
moted and court martialed. Brig. Gen. William
“Billy” Mitchell proved that the bombardment of
naval vessels from the air was feasible and talked
of the concept of strategic airpower.

A Prophecy of Doom

At the beginning of World War II, General
“Hap” Arnold, then Chief of Army Air Forces com-
mented bitterly, “During allthe years since World
War I, we have had time and no money. Now
we will have money and_ no time.” This prophecy
of unpreparedness proved all too true as the U.S.
forces lost 23,000 planes and endured 120,000 casual-
ties. » »

The German program of research and develop-
ment had been going throttle to the stops since
the end of World War I. Their war machine had
an adequate and ﬂexiblelair arm. _

By the end of the war, no doubt remained in
any mind as to the mission of modern military
aviation. It was a force that was constituted to
the most important role in modern warfare.

We have now fully realized that the role of _

our peacetime aviation development is to defend

our nation with the mightiest threat of immediate».-

retaliation that money and entprprise can muster.
This drive is pushing man to the stars with the
watch-dog concept of space satellites.

In -the language of. the airman CAVU means

calling and visibility unlimited—_the best possible
ﬂying weather. Politically speaking there should
be nothing but CAVU weather for the USAF from
now on.
, So on this ﬁftieth year of airpower let us recog-
nize these concepts of prepared peace. And let us
pray that we will never realize the full impact of
modern airpower.

Unexpected   .   

By Howie Rossen

I was surprised to learn of a
unique program for living
abroad. The Experiment in In-
ternational Living, founded
twenty-ﬁve years ago, provides
a stimulating
and education-
al experience
for young peo- ,
ple. It aims at 
creating better 
understanding 
among the peo-
ples of th e
world. _

Each ye at I
about eighty

groups of
‘Americans g o
abroad to live in the country of '
their choice. An experiment
group consists of ten young

people who represent a broad
diversity of interest and wide-
spread geographical distribution.
'Home Stay‘-living

The core of the Experiment is
the “homestay”-living as a mem-
ber of a family in another coun-
try. Participatants s e e their
adopted countries through the

, enjoyable,

 

eyes of its people. A month’s
homestay provides countless per-
sonal experiences. During the
second month the group takes an
informal trip through the coun-

try, traveling by bus, bicycle,"

train, or hiking.

The ﬁnal part of the Experi-
ment can be spent with a return
visit to the host family or trav-
eling to neighboring countries.
Although living abroad can be
the real meaning
comes from the ability to adjust
to new surroundings and situa-
tions. “Expect the unexpected”
well typiﬁes the Experiment.

Counterpart of the "outbound
program is the incoming pro-
gram which brings experiment
groups to this country. Incoming
experimenters, live with an
American family for a month,
spend two weeks on a college
campus and visit a large city.
Last summer a group from
France stayed in Pittsburgh for
their homestay. This summer
should ﬁnd another group visit-
ing our city.

Experiment Committee

Recently I attended a meeting

of‘ the experiment committee in
this area. , '

The publicity director from
the main office in Putney, Ver-
mont, recently asked the aid of
interested persons in furthering
The Experiment. Pitt can play
a major role in promoting this
unique program. Through pam-

phlets and films the committee ‘

hopes to strengthen the program
by informing students of the
wonderful experience in living
abroad. Housing the incoming
experimenters will also be part

of this committee’s responsibil-}"‘*
ities. I 

Because of today’s crises ii.‘

more emphasis is needed in in-
ternational understanding. It is
necessary for the college. student
to become aware of this situa-
tion. Newspapers and books give

‘ only a brief picture ofthe world
happenings. By traveling abroad

the actual experience of this in-‘
ternational understanding can be
translated into a warm and per-
sonal reality. Livingand learn-
ing the European way’ is certain-
ly a rare challenge.

Letters togthe Editor

Editor, The" Pitt News:

The ﬁrst clue to my most de-
ﬁnite dissatisfaction occurred
when reading Jay Butler’s open-
ing sentence to the ﬁrst of his
series of columns in the Pitt
News. As I proceeded through

his list of generalizations (meant .

to show conclusively he was dis-
satisﬁed) I realized that Mr.
Butler only substantially proved
his viewpoint immature and in-
adequate. -

With little cibility or dis-
crimination Mr. Butler swings
like a Don Quixote at what he
considers to be the evils of Pitt
as a large University. What he
lacks mostly is perspective,
which the Pitt News must have
recognized when they classiﬁed

   

the series as “impressions.”
Obviously, Mr. Butler feels his
individuality is cramped at Pitt
——an occurrence resulting from
our type of society and its edu-
cational system. There are many
schools, he should note, that are

conducted on a much more vast“

program. A scholar, however,
does not depend on crutches
which the University may or
may not offer. Pitt has provided
stimuli for thousands of gradu-
ates living successfully in the
world. The remaining ninety

percent of a man’s education de- ~

pends on himself.

If he needs counseling there
are numerous faculty and ad-
ministrative personn'el who
would be. concerned if he

   

would take the initiative. to seek
them out. If he desires to be‘
wanted, ﬁrst he must ‘make a
contribution. »

Mr. Butler’s writing srnws an
adequate command of the En-
glish language which reaches al-
most artistic proportions. But
scholarship demands more than
style. Theories must be well
founded and substantiated.

As one slightly embarrassed
Scholastic Scohlarship winner to
another, I would appreciate Jay
Butler containing himself for a
few years — not necessarily for
the new chancellors to make im-

. provements -— but for his “irn—-

pressiaons” to be less “vague.”
Sincerely,
Dave Bender, Col. *5’?

NIT Bid Iiides On Navy Win?

ny ED KOLTISKA

With only ﬁve games re-
maining on the schedule,
Coach ' Bob Timmons’ hoop-
lsters will have an opportuni-
ty to insure a winning season
against Navy Saturday.

A tough schedule and an 11-8
record has provided the Panthers
,with a National Invitational

in their remain-
ing games.

After two straight away games

at 8:30 p.m..while the gymnastics

winning streak which shows vic-
tories over Duke and Penn State
in their last two starts.

If the Panthers can get by
the Midshipmen, they will face
possible stoppers in Carnegie
Tech, West Virginia, Penn, and
Penn State in rounding out their
schedule.

Coach Timmons states, “I have
high hopes of the team coming
through with at least a 15-9 rec-
ord which would be looked upon
in a favorable light by the NIT
officials; especially if consideration
is given to the caliber of oppon-
ents that we have played.”

Tankers Show
Improvement?

By MURRAY CHASS
Paradoxical is the only way
to describe Ben Grady’s‘ evalu-

” ation of his swimming team.

After last Saturday’s two-
point loss to Virginia Military
Institute, in which the Panther
400-yard medley relay quartet
broke the Pittsburgh Athletic As-
sociation pool record for that
event, Grady claimed:

“Our boys ‘are improving; but
I can’t say that we will do too
much better in our remaining
meets because the same teams we
must face are getting rougher.”

In giving a short commentary
on the ﬁnal three games on the
schedule, Grady says, “Syracuse
has got an excellent team, Navy
is good, and Miami (Ohio) is go-
ing to be tough.”

Team Lacks Stars

Of course, in defense of the
present mermen, who have a poor.
1-5 record, the veteran Grady
who has coached 17 previous Pan-
ther swim squads also asserts that
the team doesn’t have the men it
had last year.

Citing an example of this, he
says, “We have only Warne
White for the 220- and 440-yard
freestyles. And if he has a. bad
race like he did in the 440 Sat-
urday we lose a lot.”

Another substantial reason for
the downfall of the ﬁve,-time
Eastern champions is that a few
of the tankers cannot come to
practices very often because of
classes, and as‘ Grady puts it,
“The only time I am able to see
them is if they show up for the
meets.” »
Sklar Returns

A much-welcomed addition to
the local squad is Ben Sklar, a
freestyler. Sklar has rejoined the
team in time for Saturday’s meet
after being out for a semester.
Last year Sklar was a member of
thetop Esatern 400-yard freestyle
relay squad.

For the rest of this season he
will no doubt help out in the 50-
and 100-yard freestyle sprints as
well as compete in the relays.

This Saturday in the PAA
pool the Panthers will be fac-
ing a strong Syracuse aggrega-
tion, which has a couple of all-
round swimmers in Leo Buzzard
and Pete Vanderveer.

Orange backstroker Dave Mc-
Gill is expected to give Don Web-
er a tough race while Ken Stoll
and "Paul Fleshman are the one-
two choices in diving.

The Panther gymnasts, out to improve their standing in
the Eastern Intercollegiate Gymnastics League, entertain
Navy on Saturday night at the Field House starting at 7
p.m. The local tumblers stand one win and two losses in

the Eastern loop and need a wine

over the tough Middies to even
their record.

Coach Warren Neiger’s crew,
fresh from a close win over Tem-
ple, once again will be handi-
capped as Tom Darling has a pull-
ed shoulder muscle. It’s the same
shoulder which slowed Darling
earlier with bursitis. Otherwise
the Blue and Gold are in good
shape.

The Navy gym team has beat-
en West Virginia, West Chester
and Temple- (all Panther vic-
tims, too). Last week the Mid-
shipmen were trounced by pow-
erful Penn State. The acrobats
from Annapolis beat Temple by
almost the same margin as did
Pitt. 

Navy appears strong in theside
horse and rope climb events
which could cause the Panthers
plenty of trouble. “This is a match

which could go either way,” Coach
Neiger» conceeds. “This is my best
team yet, and I’ll have to stick
with them on Saturday.”

In the six meets thus far this
season sophomore Dave Hirst,
with consistent swing on the ﬂy-
ing rings and in tumbling, leads
individual scorings with 81 team
points to his credit.

Veteran Jack Hammond is
second with a high score of 661/,
points compiled in a variety of
events. Jim Mulvihill, canny

high bar and parallel bars per- ,

former, is third with 64.

During the mid-semester break
the Jungle Cat acrobats lost to
Syracuse 49-47, in a heart break-
er; crushed Lock Haven, 68%-
271/2; lost‘50-46 to Army; tripped
West Virginia 69-27; and beat
Temple 54-41.

Sharpshooters
Meet Indiana

Sergeant Joe Gromko’s sharp-
shooters face Indiana State Teach-
ers Friday evening at the Stadium
range in hopes of improving their
standing in the Greater Pittsburgh
Riﬂe League. The shoot will begin
at 6 p.m.

This shoot is almost a “must”
forthe Panther shooters who are
currently waging a close battle
with Duquesne and West Virginia
for the league championship.

After the Indiana contest the
Jungle Cat marksmen have only
two meets remaining. They are
with Carnegie Tech and
Mountaineers.

If the present pace continues
the Panthers could very well end
the season in a deadlock with
Duquesne or West Virginia which
would necessitate a shoot-off to
determine the regular season
titlist.

collaborated for a third place
ﬁnish among a ﬁeld of ﬁfteen
selected affirmative teams on
the national topic, “Resolved:
That the United States should
discontinue direct economic aid
to foreign countries.”

But the best was saved for last

On the Pitt A team aﬂirma-
tive were Wilmer Baldwin, Col.

- John Strauch, Col. '60, and Sam
Reich. Reich and Strauch were
undefeated. For the B team,
Sam Formica, Bus. Ad. ’60, and
Richard Cromie, also ‘undefeat-
ed, held down the atﬁrmative
side of the issue; while Gary
Hess, and Gene Klein, Bus. Ad.
’59, upheld the negative.

For the Men’s Debate Associa-
tion, the mid-semester vacation,
