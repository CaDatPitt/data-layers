Peace Corps
Tests Slated
F or May 27

Peace Corps candidates who
want to begin their service this
summer will be tested at the Vic-
tory Building, Ninth and Liberty,
this Saturday and June 5. Volun-
teer forms can be obtained from
post offices or the Office of Cult-
ural and Educational Exchange
in Amos Hall.

The Peace Corps is actively re-
cruiting for engineers, surveyors,
geologists, teachers of English as
a second language, community
development workers and agri-
cultural extension workers.

Last week President Kennedy
announced a surveying project
in Tanganika; surveyors, geolo-
gists, and civil engineers are
needed. Similar skills will be
needed for projects in Latin

America, Africa, and South Asia.

several projects will be an-

nounced in May and June.

Robert Sargent Shriver, Direc-'

tor of the Peace Corps, said of
many liberal arts graduates,
“They believe that because they
are not expert with a slide rule
they have no function to per-
form.”

“The Peace Corps needs them
as much as it needs anyone. For
example, they can be taught to
teach English either as a first or
second language to other peoples
in the training they will receive.”

English teachers will be placed
in African, Asian, and Latin
American primary and secondary
schools by the end of the year.
Requests have also been made

$60,000 Given
To the University

For Tumor Study

The United States Department
of Health, Education, and Wel-
fare has appropriated over
$60,000 to the University’s De-
partment of Biological Science for

a three-year study of plant
tumors.
Dr. Charles Gainor, associate

professor of bacteriology and di-
rector of this research project. is
attempting to determine what
role the organic agents, which
hasten the transformation of pro-
tein into amino acids, have in
the development of tumors.
Much of this work concerns
crown-gall, a tumorous plant
disease inducted by bacteria.
This same bacteria was once be-
lieved to be responsible for can-
cerous growths in animal tissue.
Recent research on crown-gall
tends to indicate that there are
similarities between plant and
animal tumors centered in the use
of protein by plants and animals.
This grant is the second gov-
ernment award to be given to
the University for research con-
cerning abnormal growths in

* plant tissues.

L.A. Notice

Describes

New Rules

Course Contents
Objectives Listed
With More Depth

By JACQUES WERTHEIMER

The long awaited “School of
the Liberal Arts Announcement
1961-62” was published on May
15.

This new 187 page bulletin
symbolizes the culmination of a
three year effort by the Liberal
Arts Department to revamp its
courses and requirements to meet
the demands of a growing Uni-

versity and of an inquiring stu-
dent body.

While the announcement opens
with a brief statement of admis-
sions requirements and academic

programs and expenses, 90% of.

the bulletin is devoted to the list-
ing of departmental requirements
and the description in depth of
course contents and objectives.

The requirements are intended
to give the students the best
possible education and at the
same time the greatest possible
latitude in the election of
courses.

One major change is that new
students will not be required to
take a “preforming” laboratory
science. It is felt that many stu-
dents would beneﬁt more by the
option of electing for their lab
science a special laboratory course
where the experiments would be
performed bya competent man.

It must be noted though that
the new requirements stated in
only to
those freshmen entering in Sep-
tember 1961, while‘ those present-
ly enrolled will continue to be
subject to the present require-
ments.

Dr. Albert Martin, Dean of
the School of the Liberal Arts,
states thatthere will be a trend
in several areas towards larger
classes to give more students the
beneﬁts of especially stimulat-
ing professors. He emphasizes,
however, that both small and
personal classes will remain an
integral part of the University’s
program.

Students are advised to secure
in addition to this new announce-
ment a copy of the “Student

illandbook, School of the Liberal

Arts” which gives a detailed ac-
count of the rules and pro-

ceedures of the Art’s school.

FOR FOREIGN TRADE CAREERS

U. S. foreign trade is booming
and so is the demand for college
graduates trained in that field,
international trade
specialists at The American In-
stitute for Foreign Trade, world-
famed post-graduate school in

, Phoenix, Arizona, for the train-

ing of young college, graduates
genuinely interested in a career
overseas with U. S. business or

government.
‘R. S. Roberts, vice president of
The American Institute and

widely-known foreign trade au-
thority, who last year completed
11 years in Brazil as 21 Sears of
Brazil executive, as the origina-
tor of the first supermarket chain
in Brazil, and ﬁnally as a consult-
ant to U. S., foreign, and Brazilian
ﬁrms, 'said that U. S. international
businesses had invested $32 billion
overseas as of last year, represent-'
ing a 17.2% average increaseper
year. He placed the earnings
from these foreign investments at
$3 billion, 700 million. U. S. for-
eign sales totaled $64 billion, with
exports at $21 billion and sales
by U. S. foreign subsidiaries at
$43 billion of the total.

Roberts, a 1948 graduate of the
Institute, applauded the major
role played by the 3,000 graduates
of this 15-year-old school in the
meteoric rise of U. S. foreign
trade. _

Senator Barry Goldwater, Ari-
zona, member ot the Institute
board of directors, in a recent
speech on the U. S. Senate ﬂoor,
called American Institute alumni
“America’s best-trained and most
highly-respected corps of good-
will ambassadors.” He described
the Institute as private industry’s
training ground for its corps of
junior executives in 78 foreign
nations.

Graduates in liberal arts, busi-
ness administration, and science
are sought annually at The Amer-

ican Institute for Foreign Trade
by more than 500 U. S. interna-
tional business and banking ﬁrms_

‘Fifty percent of the 1960-61 grad-

uates had college majors in liberal

arts or sciences. Forty—ﬁve percent
had majored in business admini-
stration.

Cited by U. S. and foreign in-
dustrialists, educators, and high
government officials as America’s
most effectual institution for the
practical training of college grad-
uates in foreign trade, The Ameri-
can Institute offers a 3-part cur-
riculum designed to train its po-
tential junior executives in day-
to-day foreign trade techniques
the living culture of the people;
of world market areas, and a for.
eign language. Recruiters from
U. S. international ﬁrms have
made it clear that they equate
general cultural knowledgeability,
a properly-adjusted attitude to-
ward an. overseas career, and ap-
titude when they select Institute
graduates.

About 250 carefully—screened
young men are graduated yearly,
The post-graduate course of study
lasts two semesters and starts
from the beginning both in Sep-
tember and in January.

Industry and government offi-
cials say there is no institution of
comparable stature where deter-
mined college ‘graduates may so

‘effectively groom themselves for

a lucrative career abroad. Sena-
tor Goldwater predicts that most
Americans who become business
leaders in trade centers around
the world in the next few years
will have been trained “speciﬁcal-
ly at The American Institute for
Foreign Trade.” (For more detail-
ed information, please communi-

parking spaces.

Although students face this problem on a year-long
basis, it is intensiﬁed during baseball season. Complaints
about it seem to register negatively with city officials, and
so the competition among Pirate fans and students for
street spacecontinues. A

Students pacify this ever-present -frustration by mak-
ing the Pirate fans the scapegoat for their misery. It is true
that automobile drivers with baseball fever do increase the
parking problem in the Oakland area, but "it is not true that
city officials show little concern for this problem even if
their policemen’s., faces show tints of joy as they pin a
ticket securely beneath a windshield wiper.

lCity ofiicials demonstrated a great .concern for this
parking problem last Fall when they refused to approve
the construction of theproposed $13 million men’s dormi-
tory because it did not provide adequate parking facilities.

The attitude of many city officials at that time was
that the University was responsible for providing parking
facilities for its members. Councilman Craig Kuhn stated
that if they don’t accept it, then the city will inherit the
parking problem and will be forced to spend more tax
money to solve a problem created by a tax—exempt institu-
tion.

The parking dilemma for students is deﬁnitely the
University’s problem. Anyone who blames either Pirate
fans or city city oﬂicials for this problem overlooks the real
source of trouble. ‘

What can the University do about the parking situation?

A University ofﬁcial would most likely answer that
when the new dormitory is built and when Logan Armory
is converted into a parking garage, then the severe park-
ing problem will disappear.

This answer paciﬁes me. Since attending the Univer-
sity does not demand participation in an austerity. program,
what can we do?

Jlt is rather simple. During the third trimester, the
number of faculty members decreases and consequently
the number of University restricted parking spaces in-
creases.

If one passes Clapp Hall during the day, he will notice
an empty, or almost empty lot. The free space in this and
other restricted lots should be used by someone, so why
not students. Also there are about 40 available parking
spaces for rent in the University’s Schenley Apartment
Garage. Since they are not being used, why not let students
use them free of charge.

A student petition for space might help. Obviously this
parking problem remains in the hands of the student. If
University officials need reminded of the student’s plight
and of the misery of a mundane event like parking, then it
is the student’s job to do this.

If not action is taken, Pirate fans will continue to take
the choice parking spots, city policemen will persist in
tagging student gamblers at the meter spots, and students
will probably not bother to toss their complaints at the
correct target.

Those Awkward Years  

By Jim Vaughan

In a way, Simon Overgrad is a member of our
“University family.” A rosy-cheeked blushing
fellow whose hands remain unsullied by money,
Simon is a budding academician. He just took his
Masters degree in Philometry,
and is now working toward his
doctorate.

To try to assign a status to
Overgrad is not an easy thing to
do. You can’t exactly call him
a student (not only because he’d
resent being called that name)
because he teaches classes. But
then again, you can’t exactly call
him a teacher. either (though
he’d like nothing more) because .4
he’s enrolled in courses. He’s '
sort of in that awkward in-between stage called
“graduatestudent instructor.” '

Let’s take a candid look at this Mr. Simon Over-
grad during his first period as a teacher.

After having waited for ﬁfteen minutes in a
room on the wrong ﬂoor and after having made the
traditional panic stop at the information office,
Mr. Overgrad was now close on the trail of his
class. He charged around the corner of the hallway
and came to a halt outside the right room. Breath-
ing heavily, he buttoned the front of his grey suit,
brushed up his crew cut, straightened his tie and
hauled open the door.

The room was full of students; they hushed and
turned to look at him as he entered.

A creature of habit, .Mr. Overgrad started to
slink towards his favorite seat in the back corner
of the room. But after taking a few steps, he
stopped, turned around, and ﬂed toward the front
of the room where he tripped over the waste has-
ket on the way to the lectern.

A Hedging Flies

While arranging his things on the lectern and

table, he peeked up at the class. All the students

were watching. '

He went to the blackboard and started writing.
By the time he had written‘.“Simon Overgrad,” he
had broken the chalk three times; with the quarter-
inch piece of chalk that remained he scratched
down his oﬁice number and hours. Then, somewhat
reluctantly, he added the preﬁx “Mr.” to his name.

After returning to his place, he took hold of the
lectern with both hands and directed his attention
to a smudge on the rear wall; he opened his mouth
to begin speaking, but the words “DOES EVERY-
ONE” exploded from his throat. He stopped, his
mouth still agape, and looking around as if in
search of a hidden loud speaker. He cleared his
throat and started again, this time with appreciably
less volume. ..

He dispensed with the introductory ceremony in

 

ﬁve minutes, thereby leaving an hour and fifteen
minutes for his lecture.

Shifting his attention from the smudge on the
rear wall to the center of his notes he launched into
his lecture. At ﬁrst he proceeded with long pauses
and rapid bursts of speech. But soon he slowed
down and smoothed out to a rate of only a Couple
hundred words per minute.

As more time passed he held onto the lectern
less and less (despite knocking it in a girl’s lap)
and, though ﬂeetingly, actually looked a couple stu.
dents right in the eye. All the while he paused in
his lecture only long enough to take a breath.
Life's Longest Moments

Within a couple more minutes he was taking oc-
casional adventures from the lectern to have brief
forays with the blackboard. He had even managed
to take a couple glances at the knees of the pretty
girl sitting in front. Lost now in his lecture he
sped through his notes at a reckless speed. _

By the time the ten o’clock bell rang, Mr. Over-

T grad had knocked over the lectern once more,

written on all the blackboards and presented all the
arguments proving Philometry to be a genuine sci-
ence. He stood there lecturing with his one hand
rubbing the back of his neck and the other oscil-
lating between the knot in his tie and the loose
button on his coat.

He ﬁnished reading a quotation from Aquinas
and flipped the page of his notes when suddenly
he encountered the empty yellowness of the manilla
folder. He casually brought up his left hand and
stole a look at his watch while brushing an imagi.
ary speck of dust from his notes: forty minutes to
nary speck of dust from his notes: forty minutes
to go!

Holding onto the lectern tightly again (while the
girl in front of it cringed in her seat) he slowed
down , his speech. Not without a perceptible
stammer, he. proceeded to elaborate on Aquinas. He
ﬁnished the last point in his lecture, gave a sum-
mary in which he repeated himself several times,
and slowly closed his notes.

He shifted his weight from one foot to the other,
buried one hand in his pocket and looked 6ut the
window. A couple students coughed; the girl in
front stirred in her seat. Mr. Overgrad sneaked
another look at his match and frowned.

He suddenly beamed. “Okay everybody,” he
announced, “we’re going to have a little quiz. It’s
just for practice this time, though, so don’t worry."
Thus passed Mr. Simon Overgrad’s first period as
a “teacher.”

After class he dumped the quizzes and his notes
in his bookbag and started toward the door, but
stopped at the blackboard. He looked around -
everybody had gone. He reached up, rubbed his
arm along the chalky blackboard, looked at his coat
sleeve, smiled and walked briskly from the room.

Letters to the Editor

Service Lacking
At Book Center

Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to voice a few
criticisms of situations here at
the University which I believe
should be corrected. But, unfor-
tunately, you will doubtless have
room in one issue for more than
one of these.

So. let’s take the Book Cen-
ter; by all means, the Book
Center ﬁrst. Somehow I have
been given the impression that
the Book Center exists to per-
form some kind of service for
people hereabouts. What kind of
service, I can’t imagine. But a
service.

It certainly doesn’t take into

consideration the welfare of its
customers, the largest proportion
of whom are students, when
stocking test books —- texts re-
quired for courses.
 I am given the distinct im-
pression that the Bookmarket
dreads the though of having
more than one text book left on
its downstairs shelves by the end
of the semester. The Center
never seems to have enough text
books.

This is good business, I guess,
because, because, well for some
crazy reason. But should the
management of the Bookmarket
decide some time to change its
 policy, I recommend

sio trig ext hooks

   

for each term they contact both
the registrar’s office and the
instructors involved.

From these‘ sources they will
be able to compute, without

:much difficulty, how many text
.books they should carry and
.what books they will need in

order to perform a service which
they do not at the present.

Amdur's Column

Editor, The Pitt News:

I should like to congratulate
Ina Amdur for her article on
the House Un-American Activi-
ties Committee that appeared in
the May 8 Pitt News.

It took a great deal of courage
to write an article like that and
to have it printed. The very fact
that one has to be “brave” or
“courageous” to speak one’s mind
is an indication of just how nec-
essary it is for articles like Miss
Amdur’s to be read and thought
about

All of us who value the Civil
Liberties that are embodied in
the Amendments to th'e U.S.
Constitution should be proud to
have Ina Amdur on the staff of
our school paper.

Roman Baths
Editor, The Pitt News: NN
One of the lesser known won-

,-ders of the Pitt campus, second

only to the rolling hills of our
grassland, and the overabun-
dance of elevator service, is the
natural phenomena of the R0-
man Baths in the University of
Pittsburgh Student Union.

How many people do you
know who have heard of them?
This seems to be a grave over-
lookance on the part of someone.
The key to this wonder is some-
think not unlike Alice in Won-
derIand’s looking glass.

The ﬁrst thing one must do is
to walk through the middle
doors (which face Bigelow) of
the Student Union. Stop! There
is a green leather couch directly
in front of you. Go up to it. Now,
instead of sitting down on it, as
millions have done and thereby
lost their opportunity, remain
facing it and kneel down on the
couch. .

Finally, look down and 00*
into the table top that you see
before you. There, between the
marble pillars, you can clearly
see the seats and baths as they
were when Caesar spoke in the
Union for the Midday Series-
And if you watch for a While»
sometimes a slave or’ two will
come by. ,

trimester and have no time for
jobs.

These students who are look-
ing for jobs are ﬁnding the go-
ing pretty rough. “The weather
we’ve been having is really put-
ting a cramp on summer jobs.”
Ricci explained that the stand-
ard summer jobs such as being
a. lifeguard, selling ice cream, or
working in a bottling pla.nt just
won't be available until the good
weather comes along, when he
expects a rush of job opportu-
nities.

Other sources are cut off, too.
"Laboring jobs seem to be non-
existent.” Unemployed men. and
wives of workers who have been
laid off are taking the jobs usual-
]y filled by college students.

Jobs Open Still

Civil Engineers, however, still
have many jobs open to them;
they are the easiest group in the
University to place because jobs
for them entail engineer training
for construction work, especially
that done by federal and state
governmental agencies, which is
at its heaviest during the sum-
mer.

Many students will have to be
content with part time work
this summer instead of the full
time jobs available in previous
summers, according to Ricci.

There are other jobs besides
that of instrument string sales-
man that are hard to ﬁll. Be-
cause of increasing tuition, most

Pitt students will not work for

the minimum wage of a dollar an
hour.

With all these factors working
against him this summer, the
University student has to register
as soon as possible with the
placement service. They have
been at work on summer jobs
since January lst.

Poor Outlook

Because of the poor employ-
ment outlook, Ricci suggests that
students should take the follow-
ing steps, in addition to register-
ing with the Student Employment
office.

1. Personally contact and ﬁle
applications with at least ﬁve to
ten of the local companies and
agencies which might be inter-
ested in hiring you during the
summer months.

2. Register with the Pennsyl-
vania State Employmcnt Office at
629 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh 22,
Pennsylvania.

3. Consider the opportunities
available with camps and resorts.
The office has in their files cur-
rent information about most of
the camps and resorts in the East-
ern United States;

4. Look over the information
they have available concerning
summer jobs with Federal gov-
ernment agencies.

The Placement Service is lo-
cated on the second floor of the
Student Union. Ricci’s office is in

Penn State Registers 14-1, 6-2
Wins Over Cats in Twin-Bill

Outhit Losers, 22-8;’

Steal 13 Bases;
Matulevic Hurt

By JIM O’BRIEN

The statistician who keeps;

the record books for the Pitt
baseball team had to dip into
red ink again this weekend as
Penn State deﬂated the ‘ris-
ing Panther nine with two
setbacks, 14-1, and 6-2 in an alo-

breviated 6-inning contest.

The Nittany Lions not only dealt
the Cats their ﬁfth loss in nine
games, but their spirit may never
recover from the humiliation. Fol-
lowing the twin defeat, Coach Bob
Lewis slipped around the locker

_ room silent. It was better not to

talk about it.

In the leadoﬁ game, the Lions
slashed out 15 hits a trio of Cat
hurlers, including loser Lauren
Guthrie who looked sharp for
three innings, until “he began to
aim the ball.” The winners also
took advantage of 10 free passes
for a decisive 14-1 win. Pete Su-
der had 2 of Pitt’s 3 hits.

Jim (No-Hit) Sylvis suffered
defeat in the second game, 6-2.
Penn State Outﬁelder Dick De-
long clipped him for two hits,
as he had a nifty six hits in
seven trips tfor the afternoon.

Cat Catcher Tim Gurgurich had
ﬁts in the backstop as the ﬂashy
Lions stole 11 bases in the six-
inning contest. Both Pitt runs
came on a homerun blast by Soph-
omore Shortstop Al Riccuitti,
which cleared the 350 foot mark.
Al had 3 hits for the day.

Captain Jerry Matulevic may
have suffered a cracked jaw in
the second game when he collided
hard with ﬁrst-sacker Pete Suder
on a pop-ﬂy behind the pitcher’s
mound.

St. Vincent To
Meet Linkmcn

Nestatcrs Take Pair;
Face West Virginia

The golf team will try to end
a losing season on a winning
note when they take on St. Vin-
cent today and then join the ten-
nis squad on a trip to West Vir-
ginia to engage the 1\/lountaineers
tomorrow.

The linxmen, whose 20-1
slaughter of Carnegie Tech gave
them a 5-8-1 card, have no chance
of gaining a winning season.
Coach George Underwood said,
“We shouldn't have too much
trouble with St. Vincent, but West
Virginia will be» tough, especially
on their home cou1's<:.” The
Panthers tied the Mountaineers
"in an earlier meeting at the Wild-
Wood Golf Club.

The West Virginia not squad
could also prove troublesome. On
Saturola_v the Cats edged the
Mounties. 5-4. The boys 1' r om
West Virginia will be out to re-
vcrsc that score.

lln Saturday‘s match, Jack

Douglas, Joe Brown, Roger

ped singles victories for the

point was scored by Douglas and

The score of. the match may
have been 6-3 but for an injury
to Kochmzm in doubles play that
forced he zmol his pzlrtncr, Ted

of the injury they were leading

had defeated Carnegie Tech, 6-3.

Bob Shanazfelt :in both the 100 and
220-yard dashes and Tomp Demp-
sey and Bill Yaley of Notre Dame
tied at the two-mile distance in
9:20.8 to set a record.

The old mark of 9:265 was set
by Penn State’s Lamont Smith in
1953.

The Panthers managed to cap-

nine including a win in the mile-
relay, but lacked overall depth.
The Irish were 15 point favorites
prior to the meet. Both teams
ran true to form with the point
difference being 14.

credits dampens their spirits to a point where they lose the
desire to give a little extra.

The trimester has also presented a‘ problem in schedul-
ing. Most of the Panthers’ opponents are on the old two term
system thus ﬁnishing school in June. This means that the
spring teams play up to the early part of June and then, with
nearly two months of school left, the Pitt athletes are forc-
ed to quit playing their sport or else go out and ﬁnd a sand--
lot team to play on.

What can the athletic department do about these
problems? Nothing! Frank Carver may be one of the
better Athletic Directors in the country, but he certainly
has no control over the weather.

As for the trimester problem, this may be worked out , ’ ’ . S
in future years if more schools accept the system. Already .  . ‘ , ,
California State Teachers College has started. If more local . '
schools follow, Pitt can lengthen their schedule, thus in- . / ‘
creasing the interest of the athletes, You’rc necded...just as your father and graiid3_'

‘relatively new, is Ollicer Training School. Here the‘
Air Force commissions certain college graduates, both
men and women, after "three months’ training. The
navigator training program enables you to win a
ﬂying rating and a commission. And, of course, there‘:
the Air Force Academy. ‘ ll
\ An Air Force ollicer’s starting salary averages out’
to about what you could expect as a civilian. First

tax-free rations and quarters allowances, free medical
and dental care, retirement provision, perhaps ﬂight
'pay, and 30 days’ vacation per year. ll comes to an
"attractive ﬁgure. One thing more. As an ollicer, you
will become eligible for the Air Force Institute of
Technology. While on active duty many ollicers will,
win graduate degrees at Air Force expense.’

Those of us who suffered through the basketball season
while our beloved Panthers went down to defeat to neigh-
boring Duquesne took great pleasure in the two baseball wins
over the Dukes. The first game was particularly sweet, as the
Dukes played like they shouldn’t be on the ﬁeld with the boys
from Skyscaper U. Pouring a little salt into the wounds,
members of the Panthers wrote a note to Duquesne’s short-
stop and star basketball player, Mike Rice, thanking him for
the win. ‘Rice had several errors in the ball game.

r‘@’tUl’ From Famous Poem. Title

By MATTHEW NESVISKY
In 1905, a group of students were searching for a name
for the first issue of the University’s yearbook. For some
inexplicable reason, they ran across the famous poem, “The
Owl and the Pussycat,” and, after associating the pussycat
with the Pitt Panther, they named the new annual “The

Owl.”

“The Owl‘ ’today is, of course,
quite a different publication, and
in recent years, the stat!‘ has at-
tempted to vary the style of the
book from issue to issue.

Under the editorship of Hank
Bonstedt. this year’s package is
a 328 volume of photos and text,
which will be distributed in
August. With a June 1 deadline,
l30nstedt's crew has literally been
working overtime to have every
page laid—out and in the hands
of the printer.

The editor sadly reported that
he went a record (tor “Owl” edi-
tors‘) 96 hours without sleep last
week. This is not due to in-
eﬂiciency on behalf of the night-
owls, however, but is a result of
the stafT’s constant perfectionism.

For example. 1.000 rolls of
ﬁlm, totaling 15,000 photographs,
have been shot for the volume.
It is the chore of the editors to
choose 1,200 for publication.

Of the 1,240 annuals to be or-
dered, 1,000 have been paid for
already, indicating that by the
end of the summer, the demand
will greatly overcome the supply.

But the yearbook is more than’
just a memory book for seniors,y
the editors point out. It has been‘
called the greatest piece of public

relations that the University has.
It has earned this reference be-
cause, as Bonstedt pointed out, “it
is a book of. by and for the stu-
dents.”

He is being‘ helped by Associ-
ate Editor Don Reisch, Photo
Editor Bill Schneider. Layout
Editor Mike Christopher and
Literary Editor Ellen Fawcett.
The group has over 150 pages
to perfect before the June dead-
line, but they are optimistic.

With a theme of “Visual Im-

pressions," the $8.82 volume is.

said to be slowly but surely turn-
ing out as one of the most unique
and memorable yearbooks ever
produced in a colleg:‘e.
