The two English  tracks,

And they were, just working off

Pitt" police Chief Ti_m Dela-
ney said that police arrested at
least 100 people in the North
Side, South Side and Oakland on
Sunday night, many for failure to
disperse. He estimated that 60 to
80 of those arrests occurred in
Oakland, where people burned
couches, Dumpsters and con-

epartment considering track

as next fall.

Last Monday, the English de-
partment held a focus group to re-
view possible improvements to the
nonﬁction and journalism curricula.
The ' department announced the
meeting in an e-mail to all English
majors and asked to hear students’
ideas, concerns and questions .

lowing the 2006 Super Bowl.

Still, he said,- the outcome
could have been worse.

Not all faculty members in the
department were notiﬁed. C

Peter Leo, an adjunct professor
who teaches the Pitt News class for

about the discussion from his stu-
dents.

Steelers fans celebrate Win with fire

Police, page 1

Some students managed to get part of a
barricade and attempted to light that on
ﬁre, too. . .

People celebrating broke windows to
the Bruegger’s Bagels, Copy Cat, Heming-
way’s Cafe, Hillrnan Library, The Original
Hot Dog Shop and the space that used to
be Boomerang’s Bar & Grille.

A group of people tore down the Port
Authouritye bus shelter,.on, the corner‘; of
Forbes ‘Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard.
They knocked out the paneling on part of
a University shuttle station outside the Ca-
thedral.

While he was still waiting to receive of-
ﬁcial damage estimates, -

Delaney said that people participating
in this year’s festivities caused ‘‘a lot more
damage, a lot more ﬁres”, than those who
joined in the previous Super _Bowl celebra-
tion. , ' ' _

Diane Richard, spokeswoman for the
city police,echoed his message. ~

“Disruptive behavior causes loss of

property, unnecessary arrests and unsafe
conditions for others,” she said in an e-mail.
“The [city police] would like to encourage
disruptive fans to be more responsible and
cognizant of their behavior, because their
actions impact many innocent fans who
want to have a great time and celebrate in a
peaceful manner.”

Several students who participated in the
celebration said they thought the damage
was to be expected.

Pitt sophomore Brandon Miller joined
the estimated 7,000 to 10,000 people who
packed the streets just minutes after the
Steelers won their record-setting sixth Su-
per Bowl. _

“I’m pretty sure stuff ’s going to be on
ﬁre soon,” he said a few minutes after the
game ended. “It’s just Pitt football; It’s
what we do.” I _ _

' Shortly later, celebrators ignited a_ 
ﬁre containing at least one couch’ and wood
that Delaney thought was construction ma-
terial taken from near Hillman Library on
Forbes Avenue outside of the 7-Eleven,
causing problems for the police. I ii

“We wanted to disperse the crowd and
move it,” said Delaney. “We couldn’t"move
the crowd, because we couldn’t get the‘ ﬁre
out, and we couldn’t get the ﬁre truck in.”

People set Dumpsters, T van ‘seats and
cars throughout Central Oakland on ﬁre,
police said over their scarmer on Sunday
night. The Pitt police had 40 fire extin-
guishers on hand _Sunday night — twice
as many as they did when in 2006 — and
drained every one of them, said Delaney.
He is working on conﬁrming how many
ﬁres to which the police and ﬁre depart-
ments ofﬁcials responded. . ’ p

More than 125 ofﬁcers — 54 Pitt police
ofﬁcers and their counterparts from the
city, county and state police and country
sheriff ’s ofﬁce — were stationed in Oak-
land. More than 400 ofﬁcers were stationed
throughout the city, said Richard. , ~

EDITORIAL

‘W V U degree scandal makes
all graduates lookbad "

Last year, West Virginia Uni-
versity endured scorn of harrow-
ing proportions after the Pitts-

burgh Post-Gazette reported that
the school had awarded an M.B.A. '

to Heather Bresch, an executive of
'Mylan, Inc. and daughter of West
Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin, "even
though Bresch did not complete
enough credits to earn the degree.

But the scorn could potentially‘

get far worse. According to a re-

port released by the American As- '

sociation of, Collegiate Registrars
and Admissions Ofﬁcers, WVU’s
records show that the University
awarded a total of 288 degrees to

students who did not meet credit.

requirements between May 1997
and August 2008. Furthermore,
WVU’s Interim President C. Peter
Magrath says none of the degrees
will be rescinded.

If. a student didn’t earn a de-
gree, he shouldn’t be awarded
one. While it’s understandable that
WVU might not want to rescind
degrees awarded as many as 12
years ago, the decision certainly
doesn’t help the school’s stand-
ing. The school could easily offer
the needed credits to those alumni
who received the certiﬁcations
wrongfully, allowing them to com-
plete their courses and rectify the
mistake.

The deeper issue, though, is
that this scandal calls into question
the process by which all schools
award degrees in the first place.
If credit hours become arbitrary
and meaningless, and all it takes to
graduate is an adviser’s signature, it
cheapens the entire education of
not only those students who didn’t

‘ learn their degrees, but of  the
thousands of others who 

In a sense, this is grade inﬂation
taken to its logical extreme. Just as
some students are awarded an “A”
grade for only doing‘ “B”-level
work, these graduates got a reward
indicating hard work and perse-
verance that they didn’t have to
undertake fully. Just as the gradual

' inﬂation of grades is often pointed

to as an indicator of slipping aca-
dernic standards, the WVU situa-
tion could be seen as an indicator
of those same‘ standards being
dropped entirely.

This isn’t to say that the stu-
dents in question were not ‘hard
workers or intelligent people — it
would be interesting to see if any
of the 288 unearned degrees were
awarded’ as a result of clerical er-
rors or miscommunication be-
tween students and advisers. What
it does show is that the rigorous
process of vetting students and
forcingthem to work hard for a
degree to symbolize that achieve-
ment was not in place consistently
at WVU. V

This scandal could also be an
opportunity to push for stronger
open-records laws .for private and
state-related schools to verify that
similar practices aren’t in place at
Pitt or other universities. That re-
proachful behavior of this sort
could go on for so_long — more

’ than 10 years — at a state school

forces into question the practices

" of other schools where problems

haven't been reported.
In the end, W V U’s degree scan-
dal doesn’t just hurt the school or

_ the students to whom it gave un-

earned degrees. It hurts the entire
institution of higher education
and every person ir1 the college

system.

Steelers riot epic,

  
   

by Ben Korman
Colum/uldt I

 
November’s Barack Obama victory
celebration was a tough act to fol-
low. ‘Through abraded» larynxes,
participants hailed the event as “tri-
umphant,” “generation—defining”
and “totally off the chain, man,
Roofster climbed a freaking lamp
post!” '
Facebook photo albums en-
titled “Yes We Did!” and “OMG
HISTORY” effectively countered
Cynics who predicted that the sig-
niﬁcance of the first black presi-
dent’s election would be lost in the
uninhibited uproar of a good, old-
fashioned college not. Although
‘ most not critics classify the event as
a “celebration” atypical of the riot
genre per se, it was, as they say, one
of the classics. '
Many of my colleagues argue
that Oakland set its rioting prec-
edent in the 2006 Steelers victory

riot. For those who were still in
high school at the time, this was
when Oakland residents managed
to invert four undoubtedly use-
less automobiles and garnished the
storefronts of several small busi-
nesses with some much—needed
“urban ﬂair.” However, this clas-
sic riot was the culmination of 25
straight Super Bowl-less seasons for
Pittsburgh. Thus, Oakland was de'—
cidedly cautious, and the resulting
riot was a spontaneous celebration.
By contrast, in the weeks lead-
ing up to ‘Super Bowl XLHI, many
wondered how Oakland’s potential
sequel would compare to its two
most raucous public celebrations
in recent memory. Would‘ the un-
inhibited chaos of 2006 ﬁnally be
topped? Or has the solidarity and
optimism that "Oakland unveiled
on-election, night curbed its appetite
for destruction? A
Sunday night’s event, unfortu-
V nately, began warily — as Santonio
Holmes reeled in the game-winning
pass with 1:10 left in the fourth
quarter, would—be rioters could be

ut not spontaneous enough

heard asking whether they should
put their shoes on yet or wait until
the clock had fully expired. Even af-
.ter the victory was official, I heard
other participants asking, “How

- about now? Can we go now?”

This is obviously a clear depar-
ture from the impulsive, uninhib-
ited joy Oakland demonstrated
following Super Bowl XL and Pres-
ident Obama’s election. .On Sunday
night, everything seemed contrived

.from the very beginning. It was '

almost as if the riot had been ex-
plicitly planned ithrough events on
social networking sites.

Fortunately, despite consuming
heaps of piiza and buffalo wings,
rioters were still left hungry for
some good, wholesome pyromania
and bus shelter pulverization.

, Although these‘ undertakings

are true to the classical riot genre,‘
-the premeditated nature of the
celebration created an unnerving

atmosphere of  Riot-
ers often appeared self-conscious,
wondering aloud what their next
venture would be, where they

should walk next, when the riot was
going to end and whether particular
storefronts should be vandalized
like the last time the Steelers won.
Such strict adherence to elements
of prior successes is often an indi-
cation that the rioters -have run out
of original material.
In fact, while I was standing just
a few yards away from a quite well-
executed burning Dumpster on
Forbes Avenue — one of the critic’s
foremost responsibilities is getting
as close to the action as possible
—— the crowd spotted a large can of
spilled gasoline, causing those near
it, such as myself, to retreat in mild
panicﬁ Had the riot occurred more
naturally, that can of gasoline prob-
ably wouldn’t have even been pur-
chased, and said panic would not
have occurred. On the other hand,
the riot would have earned serious
props from this reviewer had the
spilled gasoline ignited and. caused
an awesome explosion. _
On ‘the auditory side, sounds
of choppers and sirens served as
subtle undertones at times, add-

ing a nice sense of urgency to the
riot’s aural backdrop. At other times
though, such noises were overbear-
ing, all but muting the catchy refrain
of “Here We Go Steelers!” Other

choruses were less captivating,-

most notably ones encouraging the
exposure of certain female private
parts.

In rioting, as in any endeavor,
success can. be an insurmount-
able burden. Spontaneous ecstasy,
which in the past spelled success for
Oakland, unfortunately gave way
to lofty expectations, producing a
choppy,.artiﬁcial experience under
the guise of genuine bedlam. .

 into Sunday .night, I
thought I had Oakland pegged
down. Unfortunately, they seem
to have pegged themselves down
deeper  a street sign in "the
sidewalk, which, it turns out, takes
about four  and 10 minutes of
sustained effort to un-peg.

To the Editor,

The extent to which “Super Bowl mania” overtakes this region is a
consistent source of amazement and disappointment to me. On the mom-
ing after “the big game,” I wonder how many of us will note with disgust
and outrage the casualties and damage done to the South Side and Oak-
land, which were trashed and burned by unruly and drunken revelers who
felt empowered to act out as a frightening mob. »

Why aren’t those who foment mayhem sentenced to years in jail? If
such sentences were dispensed, would post-football game thuggery and

Why do we fail to make the connection that, when a region is obsessed
with a game-whose focus is violence, and the obsession is encouraged by
elected ofﬁcials who play along and receive hundreds of millions of dol-
lars of public ftmding to build stadiums and arenas, that the fans will resort
to violenceiin recognition of their football idols’ perfonnance? Can this be

a sport which we encourage our impressionable children to adore?

Although the works often seem to

in the show, which she began work
on  summer, represent a shift to
human ﬁgures as the symbolic focal
points, instead of animals

Her  “War by Proxy/ Spy
vs Spy” focuses on two spies search-
ing for each other through telescopes
from opposite sides of the work
They are separated by a cloud of
smoke and an evil being in the center
of the work Inspired by the comic
strip “Spy vs. Spy” that Bellan—Gillen

runs vvild

used to read in MAD Magazine, the
work refers to the Cold War.

Because Bellan—Gillen keeps the
spy  simple, rendering them
as white cutouts of the human form,
and because they are inspired by a
comic strip, they balance an element
of comedy with the serious nature of
the Cold War issue.

These new works are rendered
mostiy in black-and—white, with small
splotches of colors, to place the ern—
phasis on the retum to  that
these works also represent for Bellan-

tion, after her 1995 exhibition when
she was named “Pittsburgh Artist of
the Year”

“Something that overrides all of
my work, but especially my newer
work, which is more  than
painting, is amixture of delicate ren-
dering with very broad rendering,
a little bit of humor mixed in with
pathos,  to combine different
styles and bring them together,” said
Bellan—Gillen.

Few years come close to 1.99% record of qual-

I ity and groundbreaking movies If Sundays Super

Bowl commercials were any indication, this year
won’t be one of them. .
Seeminglytheendofane1a,l999wasayear

for movies that would stand the test of time —

well, for 10 years, at least “Fight Club” deﬁned
a generation of  consumers “The Blair
W/itch Project” made horror ﬁlms scary  and
inspired a new batch of faux-Handycam ﬂicks
‘The Matrix” pioneered new  tech-
niques that have since been the source of countless
homage and parody, “1\me_rican Pie’ ’ gave new life

' to the once—dead R-rated teen comedy and “The

Sixth Sense’ ’ tricked audiences and critics alike into
 that M.‘ Night Shyamalan was Hit_chcock
reborn. I

Alas, those days aregone to a place of wistﬁil
nostalgia. On the first day of February, we got a

- bleak look at what 2009 might have in store The

Super Bowl has long been a venue for premiering
big—name movie previews, as the Oscars don?t al-
low them during its broadcast — until this year,
anyway. Maybe studios are holding out for Oscar
night to let loose their best trailers (unlikely),‘be_—
cause Sunday night had little of interest to broad-
cast during the commercial breaks

Of the nine movie previews, four were sequels,
four -were based on TV shows from your youth,
and one featured an  groan-worthy scat
joke How could this happen?

The most egregious offenders were unques-

' tionably “GI_loe: The Rise of Cobra” and “Trans-
* . formers: Revenge of the Fallen,” and not because

of their long, silly titles The success of 2007’s

the studio. But is it the right approach for every
franchise?
Ifevertherewasafianchisetobegiventhe
Michael Bay “boobs and explosions” treatment,

Springsteen's new Dream is

as affecting as everbefore

Springsteen, page 7 j
The next tracks (“Tomorrow Never
Knows,” “Life Itself” and -“Kingdom of’
Days”) are all softer and tamer, with familiar
instrumentation and a feeling edging toward
melancholy. . . L -
. “Surprise, Surprise” is an upbeat but for-
gettable anthem that urges you to “open your
eyes” and “let your love shine down.”

, Just ‘when Springsteen begins to lose our
attention, he recapturesr it with his two ﬁnal,’

solemn tracks: “The Carnival” (asoft acoustic

meditation on the E Street keyboardist, Danny I

Federici, who recently passed away) and “The

, Wrestler”, (a downbeat study of a “one-

trick pony,” made for the movie of the same
name). _

All this amounts to an imrnensely satisfying
album unafraid to take chances but still stays
loyal to its fan base. While some of his themes
grow a bit redundant toward the end — name-
ly, the joys of  —— the album boils down
to an optimistic, bittersweet vision of the £11-
ture, and even the mostinsigniﬁcant of his
songs contribute -to this in their ownway.

To simply stay skilled, much less inventive,
for so long seems like a monumental feat in

a musical ﬁeld where many of the greats die

young. That’s why they call him The Boss.

Super Bowl XLIII

Crazy endlng

shocks fans

by Alex Oltmanns
Staﬂ Writer

So much in sports can change
in a mere matter of minutes. '

With just 2:53 left on the clock
in Super Bowl XLIII, the Pitts-
burgh Steelers held a 20-14'lead,
with their vaunted defense on the
field and everyone expecting them
to seal the win by stopping the
Arizona Cardinals.

Flash forward 25 seconds to

Arizona receiver Larry Fitzgerald —~

raising his arms in celebration af-
ter sprinting past numerous Steel-
ers on his way to a 64-yard touch-
down.

Needless to say, this left Steel-
ers fans dumbfounded.

“At that point I was in shock.
The whole room went silent,” said
sophomore Ben Colosmo. “To go
from winning to suddenly losing
just like that was tough.”

Then Pittsburgh quarterback
Ben Roethlisberger took the ﬁeld
to lead his team to what will surely
be remembered as one of the all-
time great game—winning drives in
Super Bowl history.

The drive was capped off by
wide receiver Santonio Holmes’

« tip-toe catch in the corner of . the

end zone with just 35 seconds left
in the game, barely more than two
minutes after the Cardinals had
scored. -

“When Holmes caught that
touchdown I was just so happy,”
said Colosmo. “Everyone around
me was screaming at the top of
their lungs.”

Pittsburgh controlled much of
the first halﬁ scoring the first 10
points of the game while milk-
ing the clock and dominating the
time of possession. But the Cardi-
nals responded with a Ben Patrick
touchdown catch and looked to
score again after a batted Roeth-
lisberger pass wound up in Karlos
Dansby’s grasp with time winding
down.

But Steelers’ linebacker and

NFL Defensive Player of the

‘Year James Harrison intercepted

Arizona’s Kurt Warner at the goal
line and returned it for a 100-yard
touchdown, the longest play in Su-
per Bowl history.

Harrison’s touchdown gave
Pittsburgh a 17-7 halftime advan-
tage.

Steelers’ kickerjeff Reed kicked

a ﬁeld goal late in the third quarter

to push Pittsburgh’s lead to 20-7,
but the Cardinals’ dynamic of-
fense ﬁnally came around in the
fourth quarter.

Fitzgerald, who was essentially
dormant in the first three quarters,
caught a touchdown pass with
7:33 left to cut the deficit to 20-14,

‘and a Steelers’ holding penalty in

the end zone resulted in a safety
and two more points for the Car-
dinals.

‘That set up’ the drama for the
theatrical final minutes.

As the clock hit zero and the
Steelers celebrated their NFL-
record sixth championship in
Tampa, Fla., Steelers fans in Oak-
land celebrated in their own way,
as well. 

“It feels great to be a fan of the
greatest franchise in the NFL with
the team setting records that are
hard to mate ,” said sophomore
Ben Gregory.

The_ Oakland Zoo lived up to
its name as Forbes Avenue and
much of South Oakland went
wild. V

Sophomore Jordan I-limes ap-
propriately summed up the scene.

. “It was South Oakland at its
finest, questionably legal but all in
good fun,” said I-Iimes.

“Here we go Steelers” chants

' echoed the streets for hours dur-

ing the riots. Even an aluminum
foil replica Lombardi trophy was
paraded throughout the mob.

The game and subsequent
riot surely left fans wanting more.
Who knows? Maybe it will all hap-
pen again next year.

Wrestling

by Adam Littman
Senior Staﬁ’ Wrder

The Pitt wrestling team was on both
sides of a dominating performance in its

-A-= last two matches, dropping only one match _
against Cleveland State last Wednesday, but

winning just one against Kent State.

The matches followed a trend for the
Panthers this year, as they defeated East-_
ern Wrestling League rival Cleveland State,
but lost to Kent State, ranked No. 24 going
into the match.

Pitt is 3-6, with all three wins coming
in EWL bouts and all six losses ‘coming
against ranked out-of-conference oppo-
nents.

""3 “We thought [a difficult schedule] ‘would

beneﬁt us,” said Pitt coach Rande Stottle-
myer. “In order to do well in the season-
end tournaments you need to see the best
guys out there, and we’ve done that.”
With the win over Cleveland State, Sto-
ttlemyer, already Pitt’s all-time wins leader,
became the first coach in Pitt history to
reach 250 career wins. ' '

“It doesn’t matter whether it’s one or -

250,” said Stottlemyer. “It’s a win. We’H

, take it.”

If the Panthers’ future follows" their
past results, they should have a strong end
to the season.

Next up, Pitt welcomes EWL foe West .

Virginia to the Fitzgerald Field House
Saturday at 7 p.m. The Panthers end their
regular season with two more conference
matches, against Clarion and Edinboro,
before taking part in the EWL Champion-
ships and NCAA Championships. '

Pitt 38, Cleveland State 3

The Panthers got off to a strong start,
winning the first bouts of the match, with
jimmy Conroy and Tyler Nauman earning
Pitt. bonus points. . ~

In the 133-pound match, No. 17 Con-
roy had four takedowns and two near falls
on his way to a 15-4 major decision, giving
Pitt a 7-0 lead after two matches.

No. 10 Nauman continued an impres-
sive freshman season by earning six more
points for the Panthers. Cleveland State,’s
Lawrence Cavello started off strong, tak-

ing down Nauman early in the first period, ‘

and then scoring two points for a reversal.
Nauman tossed Cavello down to the

mat, covered him up and scored his team-

leading ninth pin fall of the season.
Stottlemyer said he’s pleased with Nau-

3

man, but he and the freshman know ‘that
the “best has yet to come.”

_ Nauman also leads the team  22-

wins this year.

“He has a chance to go to nationals, and
do something, not only this year but in
years following,” said Stottlemyer.

Right behind Nauman is sophomore
Ethan Headlee. In the 165-pound match,
Headlee scored a pin fall. It’s his eighth pin
fall of the season and 21 st win overall.

Freshman AJ. Brentzel scored a 14-3
major decision in the 174—pound match.
He was ﬁlling in for fellow freshman Phil
Sorrentino, who normally wrestles in that
weight class, but was out because of an in
illness, said Stottlemyer.

The only loss on the day for Pitt came
in the 157-pound match, as freshman Alex
Munoz dropped a 6-4 decision. Munoz led
3-2 with less than 25 seconds to go, but
gave up a takedown and the lead. Munoz
was awarded a point for accumulating
more than a minute of riding time, sending
the match into overtime.

In the extra period, Munoz was taken
down for the loss.

“Conditioning is a big part of, this

sport,” said Stottlemyer. “You can’t score

February 5, 2000

Panthers split matches, stay unbeaten in conference

and then just hang out. You score and
score again. You don’t sit on leads. If you
do, that’s what happens.”

Kent State 27, Pitt 3

Conversely, Pitt managed to win only .
one match when it traveled to Kent State"

on Saturday.

“Guys realized this was a fiasco,” said
Stottlemyer. “All we can do is refocus, put
this behind us and work on our goal of
winning the EWL.” ‘

gThe only win for Pitt came-in the 149- i
~ pound match from senior Mark Powell «on

a 5-2 decision. .
Unfortunately for the Panthers, by that
time they already lost four matches and
would go on to lose their last six. Kent
State featured ﬁve ranked wrestlers, all of

whom came away victorious.

While they weren’t winning, the Pan- <

thers managed to keep most matches close,
with the largest point differential coming in
the l84—pound match when No. 5 Dustin
Kilgore defeated Zac Thomusseit with" a

. 10-3 decision. The Panthers dropped three

matches by two points and two matches by
only one point. i _

“We’ve played better against higher
ranked opponents,” said Stottlemyer. -

game. He ﬁnished 10th in the same category
for 2008. McKillop played in the Senior Bowl
this past month. .
