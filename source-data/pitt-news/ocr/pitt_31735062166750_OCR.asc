Republican Leaders Support Gov’s Budget

Sutherland House Gets Budget Dispute Discourages
Special F10at T1‘0PhY State’s Republican Leaders

For HomecomingEffort

Jim Beck, chairman of the 1967 Homecoming, announc-
ed Monday that the Homecoming committee will award a
special trophy to Sutherland House for their fl-oat in the
Homecoming parade. According to Beck, “The committee
is sorry that no separate division in the judging was estab-

lished for dormitory houses. We didn’t expect any dorm en-
tries. Sutherland’s float is the first one from a dormitory house, and
we think they deserve this award for setting a new precedent.”

Previously, Homecoming has been dominated by fraternities,
sororities and other established groups on campus. These are the
groups which have pledge classes to help with the work and money
needed to buy the materials for the construction of floats. Dormitory
houses with their small treasuries, limited space and dependence on
volunteer labor, have been limited to the undertaking of making
banners.

Sutherland House overcame these disadvantages this year when
they constructed and entered one of the largest floats in the compe-
tition. In September, Sutherland decided to “go all out” for Home-
coming this year. Even though they were aware of the strain it would
put on their budget, the members voted to construct a ﬂoat for the

event. The ﬁnal design was of
Dave “Giapetto” Hart, holding a
puppet of a Syracuse football
player, rep-resenting his control
of the Orangemen.
Preliminary construction took

~ place in the house lob-by on the

15th ﬂoor of Tower B, but most
of the work was done in the
basement garage. The officers
had to rely on volunteers to do
the work and the members re-
sponded very well. House Pres-
ident Darrell Martin said, “A lot
of people deserve a lot of cred-
it, but Len Waldorf who did the
design and a lot of work de-

‘ serves special thanks.”

Said George Dimeling, ﬂoor
counselor of Sutherland, “The
members of Sutherland House
are to be commended for their
ﬁne effort and it is hoped that
this will be picked up by the
dormitory houses next year to
make Homecoming an even big-
ger and better event.”

N RAYMOND SHAFER
Pennsylvania State Governor

by PAUL STOLLER
State Republican leaders stated Monday that they have
done everything possible to settle the appropriations policy
dispute concerning the State’s budget.

The legislative stalemate resulting from the budgetary
dispute has forced the University to borrow several million
dollars to meet its operating expenses.

Representative Lee Donalds-on, house majority leader said that
the original Shafer budget had been cut by $150 million. He sug-
gested that the Governor could not cut down his budget.

He also stated, “There is a need for additionaltaxes if the Uni-
versity is to get there appropriation.” The Democrats, he said, are
opposed, however, to an increase in taxes.‘Donaldson indicated, “The
University may never get its appropriation.”

In response to Representative K. Leroy Irvis-’s statement that the
$30 million of revenue from the cigarette tax could be made avail-
able to the state-related schools", Donaldson said this revenue will just
cover the preferred appropriations (i.e. State scholarships, etc.).

Donaldson was also critical of Representative Herbert Finemarfs
criticism of Governor Shafer’s budget. Fineman’s argument, said
Donaldson, is completely based state revenue estimations, and esti-
mations of any given source of state revenue are difficult to make.

‘The Seventh Seal’

Professor Analyzes Bergman Film

At a sparsely-attended lecture
entitled “The Film Art and the
Holy” Thursday night at the
Oratory, Prof..Arthur Tybor dis-
cussed the signiﬁoance of Igmar
Bergman’s The Seventh Seal.

Professor of philosophy at
Mount Mercy College, Tyb-or di-
vided his treatment of the ﬁlm
into three categories: technical
aspects, religious signiﬁcance,
symbolism. Although he
-stated that “we are not dealing

with the mere techniques of the

film,” he praised Bergman’s use
of both open, well-lighted, expan-
sive scenes and -small, dark,

closed settings. “Any or all of
these ‘techniques give us enough
material to consider this a seri-
ous art.”

Tybor explained that the point
of departure for the ﬁlm was
the Bible’s second chapter of the
Apocalypse, adding, “That fact in
it-self wouldn’t legitimately make
it religious art.” The picture's
the-me, also expressed in the
writings of Sartre and Camus,
is one of social humanism, ra-
ther than Judaism. “Is it religi-
ous because it asks a funda-
mental human question: ‘What
is the meaning of rnan?”' Tybor
asked, “N 0,” he answered, “that
which uniﬁes the movie is this

Montgomery Accepts New Posts
and Communications

In Finance

Edison Montgomery, president

of the In-ter-university Commun-

icaltions Council (EDUCOM), has
been appointed as vice-chancel
lor for ﬁnance and director of
Communications Programs.

EDISON MONTGOMERY
Vice—C/zancellm* of Finance

Montgomery ﬁrst came to the
University in 1956 as director of
personnel. He remained here in
a varie-ty of posts, including act-
ing vice-chancellor for the
health professions, director of
the budget, director of develop-
ment, vice-chancellor for busi-
ness affairs, director of institu-
tional planning, and, for short
periods when the chancellor was
away from the University, act-
ing chancellor, and most recent-
ly as vicechancellor for plan-
ning and general affairs.

Montgomery was nominated
for his present position of vice-
chance-llor for ﬁn-ance by Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar and elect-
ed to the post by the Universi-
ty’s Board of Trustees. He suc-
ceeds Dr. David H. Kurtzman,
former chancellor of the Univer-
sity, in that position. Dr.Kurtz-
man was appointed to -the posi-
tion in July, 1965, and held the
ofﬁice throughout his term as

chancellor.

The position of director of
Communications Programs is a
new one, created under the Uni-
versity’s recent reorganization.
It. involves direction of libraries,
Computer Center, Knowledge
Availability Systems Center, and
the Health-Law Center.

Montgomery is a management
specialist who served with the
consulting ﬁrm of Cresap, Mc-
Cormick and Paget as a princi-
pal associate from 1953 to 1956.
While with that organization,
he assisted in surveys of several
universities, including Temple,
Dartmouth, North Carolina, Case
Institute of Techno-logy, and the
University.

He is a Phi Beta Kappa grad-
uate of t'he University of Cali-
fornia. From 1939-51, he -served
as director of personnel and ad-
mini-strative planning office for
the US Maritime Commission in
Washington, D. C.

H

ous

Symbolism runs deep through-
out The Seventh Seal. The ﬁlm
follows the wanderings of a me-
dieval knight as he ﬁnds his
way home after the Crusades.
After passing through the ﬁrst
six “seals” of war, strife, fa
mine, pestilence, martyrs, and
churches, he comes to the sev-
enth seal. This ﬁnal symbol is
one of the hero's disillusion-
ment with himself and the world
he must live in . . . an expres-
sion of his wanderings in the
post-war wasteland.

A discussion of commercial
art form-s followed Tybor’-s lec-
ture. The small group of stu-
dents compared the commercial
posters of Toulouse-Lauatrec with
the recent ﬂood of drawings by
Sister Corita and Andy Warhol.

The Shafer Administration
viewpoint was further upheld by
Hugh Flaherty, legislative aide
to Governor Shafer. Flaherty in.-
dicated, “With the $150 million
in budget cuts, the State pro-
grams are running close to the
bone.”

Senator Kline has stated that
a possi.ble compromise can. only
result if the Governor cuts the
bud-get. Flaherty stated that the
Governor oan’«t -cut his budget.

Flaherty also dismissed Klineis
statement that there are suffi-
cient funds in the state treas-
ury to give each‘ state-related
school $12 mill-i-on. The on-ly way
for the universities to get their
appropriations, said Flaherty is
through the passage of the non-
preferred appropriations bills.
“There is no other way,” stress-
ed Flaherty. ‘

A budgetary hassel could be a
yearly occurenoe, according to
Flaherty. “Next year,” he said,
“The education appropriation
will increase by $100 million.
This in itself,” -said Flaherty,
“will cause budgetary problems
next year.”

Flaherty agrees with Donald-
s»on’s statement that “there is a
need fo-r new taxes.” This is in
complete repudiation of the
Fineman position stating that
there is no need for new taxes.

Panther Named Bagheera I
From Nearly 1000 Entries

Bagheera I now reigns su-
preme over the University com-
munity. The baby Panther was
thu-sly dubbed at ceremonies
during halftime of Saturday's
Homecoming game with Syra-
cuse.

One of two people to submit
the name, Frank Redo of 230
Corey Ave. in Braddock, was
declared the winner after a
drawing was held. Redo will re-
ceive a $50 gift certiﬁcate at the
store -of his choice.

Bagheera I was named after
the Panther in Rudyard Kip-
1-ing’s clas-sic, The Jungle Book.
In that story, it is Bagheera who

saves the lost infant Mdwgli
from the tiger Shere Khan. Bag-
heera then uses his oratorﬁoal
powers and lengendary strength
to induce -the wolfpack to take
Mowgli in as one of its own.

Throughout MorwgJ.i’s travels,
Bagheera follows as one of his
faithful protectors.

The committee W‘h‘llCh chose
the winning n-a.-me consisted of
Spo-rts In-formiation Director
Dean Billick, and students Pau-
la Rad-vaik, Cathy Walker, Jay
Ros-enste-in, and Mike Brourman.
Bagheera I was chosen from
more than 1,000 names.

It is pronounced Baj-a-rah.

Phys Ed Instructor
Captains Squash Team

by SHERYLL ZIPPAY
The University has a celebrity on its physical educa-

tion staff: Marigold Edwards,

affectionately known as

“Goldie” was selected as captain of the international squash
team for the competition in London in January.

“I’m very excited about it,” she says, “but they play a
slightly different game in'Eng1and than what I’m used to
playing, and I don’t know what effect that will have on the results.”
Miss Edwards has been playing squash for only three years, but feels
she owes part of her success to her extensive experience in tennis

and badminton.

“I owe a lot to the fellows over at the fieldhouse,” she remarked.

‘Pitt News’ Review

 
 

W Barbra,s ‘Simply Streisand’
Too Simple For Listeners

  

To say that Barbra Streis-
sand is one of the greatest
talents of our time is no-
thing new. Ever since the
awkward little girl from
Brooklyn came on the show
business scene five years

, ago, she has captivated large
audiences at concerts, TV
specials, her Broadway
show, Funny Girl, and of
course, her now extensive
album releases.

But when I see a performer of
Miss Streisand’s calibre slump

nto a series of just average per-
jormances, I tend to become dis-
neartened. If any other per-
former slackens from his usual

‘performance, I can say, “Well
it’s just an off night.” But Bar-
bra Streisand is not just any
other performer, so any depar-
ture from her usual deftness is,

‘as far as I am concerned, un-
forgivable.

Simply Streisand, Miss Streis-
and’s -l-atest album, is a perfect
example of what I am talking
about. Barbra sings in this al-
bum predominently Well-kn-own
songs such as “My Funny Val-
entine,” “The Nearness of You,’
“More Than You Know,” “When
Sunny Gets Blue” and the Judy
Garland classic, “The Boy Next
Door.”

Barbra adequately demon-
strates the polish and the more
mellowed vocal qualities she has
gained in the last few years,
but unfortunately, most of the

—electricity and dramatic inter-

pretations, characterizing her
earlier albums, are deﬁnitely
missing. The one good exception,
a. way-out version of “Stout-
Hearted Men” is the only ex-
ample of this earlier greatness,
but even this number is not up
to par. Miss Streisand’s voice
has noticably improved in re-
cent years, but I wish some of.
the earlier greatness had not
been sacriﬁced.

Ray Ellis’ orchestra arrange-
ments are light and graceful, of-
ten using just a piano, bass and
drums at some intervals, and -a
full-bodied orchestra, complete
with chorus, at others. But Ellis’
arrangements cannot co-mpare
with those of Peter Matz, who

mittee will meet at 6:30 p.m.

accompanied most of Miss Streis-

and’s earlier wo-rks.

Matz always seemed to help
generate the excitement needed
to underscore Miss Streisand’s
dynamic style, but without be-
littling her vocal performance.
With Ellis’ arrangement, al-
though alrtistic enough, this ex-
citement is missing.

I don’t know if Barbra Streis-

and believes s.he can get away

with anything, now that she has

the security of her reputation..

But no performer can get away
with an effortless performance,
«as Miss Streisand’s latest album
and TV special seem to have
been.

Barbra, you have proved to us
in the past that your talent is
versatile, novel, magniﬁcent and
irreplacable. Don’t desert u.s
now!

The Newspaper Fund
Opens ISP Competition

The Newspaper Fund, an organization devoted to the
promotion of high school and college journalism, offerstwo
internship programs for college students. Men in colleges
that have little if any formal journalism instruction may
apply for the Intern Scholarship Program (ISP).

The ISP offers $500 scholarships to juniors who are i

usually editors or leaders in campus journalism. The interested stu-
dent applies for help in finding a summer newspaper position and
for the scholarship which The Newspaper Fund awards at the end
of a summer's work. Applications are available through December.’
The best of the applicants are selected in January. In February,
each candidate receive's a list of newspaper editors who are willing
to cooperate with the applicants in obtaining summer jobs. The stu-

dent must obtain his own job, and spend 10 weeks gathering, writing, .

or editing news. At the summer’s end, each applicant sends The
Newspaper Fund a report of his work and his managing editor must

 

ISO International Panel Discusses
W»estern Influence, ldeas, Man

T by DONALD E. LAMPERT

A mixed picture of‘ Western ideas was presented at a panel dis-
cussion held by the International Students Organization (ISO) Sun-
day in Bruce Hall. The panel moderated by Alkis Kontos of Cyprus
consisted of Carlos Que Vedo of Equador, Malcolm Black of South
Africa, Chong Woo Kim of Korea, and Anire Sagay of Nigeria.

The discussion, which began by a semantic argument over means
of defining a traditional culture, finally resolved this point at Sagay’s

~ suggestion that a traditional idea was one which had been accepted

by the members of a society and not imposed from the outside.
Throughout the discussion the dichotomy between ideas and be-
havior was continually emphasized. The role of the missionary in
Africa was subject to continual interpretation. Kontos cited the power
of colonial rulers who professed Christianity but acted in a most non-
Christian way. Sagay retorted that the missionaries were sincere in
their beliefs, believing in a sacred duty. It was the commercialists,

traditional and the tribal, have
an advantage. Sagay blamed the
unbalanced political situaltion in
the “Third World” on the “young
ambitious political uplstarts who
can never seem to agree.

In the ﬁnal analysis, the trag-

edy of the effect-sof Western‘

inﬂuence on t-raditional culture-
has been that the West does not
stop to think whether the ideas
it exports are indeed exportable
to the countries involved.

he said, who cleared the way for colonization and exploitation.

The question of the degree of
choice in styles of life that is
necessary for a country to devel-
op was raised. Kontos,took the
view that where technology is
widespread, substantial similar-
ities in social structure develop.

His opinion was «subjected to,

heated criticism but in the end
was seemingly accepted because
of a lack of evidence for either
point of view.

After espousing the idea that
no society was either entirely
traditional or mo-dern, Kim as-
serted that, “The irony of the

-Page 4 -- THE PITT NEWS — Wednesday, November 3, 1967 _

Editorial: Intolerable State

“The University may never get its appropriation.” So stated House
Majority Leader’ Lee Donaldson (R.-Allison Park) in a Pitt News inter-
view. We have heard many questionable remarks since the legislative
‘hassle over approprliations began, but the one cited above is by far the
most unbelievable. How can we be expected to believe that that statement
has any value other than a publicity one?

_ Other remarks by Republican leaders were equally discouraging.
A Governor Shafer’s legislative aide, Hugh Flaherty, stated that “a bud-
 getary hassle could be a yearly occurrence.”

\ So now we are tol-d that our University may never get its :ppropria—
‘ tion and that even if we do get our money, we must possibly face yearly
struggles. toreceive our funds. We can e-asily believe the latter statement,
as this is the second year in a row that the University has waited until
our obstinate state officials finally decided on a compromise. We strongly
feel that the only reason the University become state related in time for do_
a tuition reducti-on last fall was because all of the state legislators and the
Governor were then running for office. There are only municipal elections
this year, hence no urgent need to reach a decision in order to save face.

H-owever, we cannot understand how our state officials feel they can
continue to make political hay out of the.vital matter of state appropria-
tions. We must call the Republicans, particularly Governor Shafer, on the
carpet once more andurge them to quit issuing statements such as the

  
  

ones we cited above to give strength to their case. As far as we can see,
their case may have had credibility two months ago, but it has worn
pretty thin by now. ’

But perhaps we are wrong to dismiss Rep. Donaldson’s remarks.
What if there is any truth to his declaration that the University may
never get its appropriation? If this would occur, we would then have to
question the entire elective process, specifically its operation in Pennsyl-
vania. For, disregarding party labels, the men elected to serve the people
in our Commonwealth are elected to do just that. We can accept the poli-
tical realities that do exist, but we cannot accept the disaster that has
occurred in our state government already, as it is actually inoperative.
Legislators have told us how state government is virtually ground to a
halt, with the only accomplishments being the publicity releases issued
by a few key participants in the legislative hassle. They complain of going
to Harrisburg for their regular sessions but of really having nothing to

Obviously, the situation has gone much too far already. We think
it is now time for the thousands of people affected by the state’s failure
to function to voice their complaints directly to Governor Shafer and
their elected representatives. We cannot understand why anyone should
tolerate this debacle. In this specific instance, to keep sjilent is only to
sanction the irresponsible actions of the men elected to serve us. This we
refuse to do.

   E On ROTC

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

 Military In Society

by Dan Booker

In the earnest dissent of Students for Peace (SFP) against present
-policies concerning the Vietnam war, the local Reserve Officers Train-
ing Corps (ROTC) program has been identified as the ogre which
promotes “militarism” and “blind obedience” in students who should
be concerned not with “the study of death but with the examination
of life.” In a recent column, Ivan Abrams-, president of SFP, leveled
these criticisms of ROTC and insisted that “we must divorce the

- military from society.”

But, these criticisms and the rather frightful suggestion of sep-
aration of the military and society overlook some basic facts con-
cerning the place of the military in American society.

Just as the Abrams column maintains, the United States military
establishment is, by its very nature, an integral part of society. How-
ever, the column would seem to dismiss a contention that the men
“lib §%i¥¥z‘é iii the ‘Al‘il’1'étl Forbes are not members of a -special class,
but are citizens who share the same moral, political, and social values
as theremainder of society.

Certainly the fear of military control of our culture voiced by
Abrams is predicated on a belief that the values of the military run
counter to those of the society in general. Abrams and SFP have n‘ot
shown evidence supporting the charge of military control and this
writer doubts that conclusive evidence can be presented. But this is
not that issue I find most relevant.

The most important factor here is that the fear expressed and
the solution offered constitute a paradox. To remove any entrench-
ment of the military in American life would be to 1) abolish any
form of military institution, or 2) establish a detached, professional
army.

Given the present and historical role of the military in protecting;
interests of national security and maintaining internal law and order,
and given all foreseeable realities, complete abolition of the military
is beyond reach.

To follow the second course of action, the more probable course,
would lead to the separation of the military from the ideals held by the
society, and more seriously to the loss of any control of the military
by society. There would be no committment by military leaders to the

"traditional values of the culture. The military would become a force
unto itself controlling the principle means of physical coercion.

This is the characteristic of a police, not a democratic, state. This
is characteristic of government over the people, not for the people.

The citizen army itself is the greatest assurance that military men

The following is in rmswer to a
student's question and, as Pro-
fessor Lec titles it, is E

An Open Letter to a
Dissenting Student

You have paid me the tribute
of asking me for an opinion on
some of the difficult issues in
which all of us are now involved.
Because, as your teacher and
your friend, I adm-ire you. I
wish to respond as fully and as
sincerely as I can. The gross
and visible object of our d-iffe.r-
ences is how to achieve that
peace which each of us desires
in Vietnam; but the essence
which will be present even after
peace is achieved is the ques-
tion whether your group or any
group, right or wrong in its
views, can justly exercise the
tyranny of .a minority which in
my opinion you and your ad-
visers are seeking to do.

When professors and students
in Italy ignored the tyranny of
minorities, Fascism was created.
When professors and students
in Germ-any ignored the tyranny
of minorities, Nazism was es-
tablished. And my generation
and others paid heavily to op-
pose it and to defeat it. It will
perhaps offend you-that I see
in the tyranny of your minority
the beginning of a similar dan-
ger, just as I abhor and oppose
a group which you believe to be
very different from yours—-the
John Birch Society. And be-
cause the charge is a heavy one,
I will illustrate why I ho-ld such
views:

5 Your right to make protest
marches is‘ clear beyond dispute;
but your right to break intg the
Pentagon is not. ‘

>The right of members of
your protest m-arch to make
thoughtful and sincere speech-
es is beyond dispute; the right
of Mr. Robert Lowell, a cele-
brated and greatly honored mem-
ber of our society, to speak of
those elected to office and run-
ning the country as criminally
imbecilic is not.

'> If you oppose any and all
activities other than the pursuit
of higher learning in the Uni-
versity establishment, I will hold
your View is conrect; but if you
wish to block bodily Navy re-
cruiting and certain job recruit-
ing, while having daily a place
in the University from which
you can distribute anti-Vietnam
literature, civil disobedience lit-
terature, and arm bands, I hold
that you are inconsistent and
unjust in your actions.

>1 believe that if a loud
group of students shouted down

Profess-or H-ans Morge nt h a u._

when he was speaking, or Mr.
Herbert Apitheker when he was
speak=ing, you would be offended
and would consider that a great
injustice had been done. I ho-ld
that view; but also I hold that
it is coward-ly and discourteous
and unjust to attack and to
shout down Secretary McNa-
mara or Secretary Rusk. I hold
that it is cowardly because it
shows a fear of what they have
to say openly and because they

will not beco-me too detached from the culture they serve. Whatever

else the draft does, it insures that se-rvicemen remain closely aligned  
to the values they held in civilian life. e  - I 
ROTC serves a similar function. Most Army officers come from  _ 

the ROTC programs. For the four years these men spend in college,
they come to know and accept, as much as the majority of their peers,

_ the liberal academic and humanistic values the ideal education seeks
to-inculcate. Service in the Armed Forces does not mean for these
men rejection of these values.

To the “examination of life” which Abrams calls central to a
University one must add preparation for life, in both an ideological
and practical sense. The University must provide the opportunity for
its clients‘, the students, to gain both the analytical skills and the basic
information needed to operate in the society. Military life is as much
a profession in society as any other field. Students who freely opt
for this profession should be given the opportunity to prepare for it.

The fact that the military doe-s play a role as a profession in the
society and the nearly universal affects of military service on the
future of students‘ are reasons why ROTC should be available to stu-
dents.

But the overriding factor is that ROTC helps maintain societal
values in the military establishment. Until the aims implied by the

- name “Students for Peace” are a reality and as long as the military
is made up essentially of “citizen" soldiers, the ROTC as a chief
-organ for the maintenance, of the military carmot be discarded.

cannot respond in kind. I hold
that the treatment of any per-
son in such a manner is discour-
teous. I hold that it is unju.st be-
cause it is not giving equality of
opportunity to those with Whom
you preconceive a disagreement.

> A further opinion which
may startle you is the opinion
that the actions of a minority at
the University of California cre-
ated the present power of -Gov-
ernor Reagan of California; and
that does not please me. I hold
that your actions to Mr. George
Wallace, former Governor of
Alabama, much material with
which to light the ﬁres of fear
and hatred in his listeners; and
his coming to power would
alarm me.

> Of your advisers whom I
know I hold very negative opin-
ions. I have not failed to tell
them so when they have ap-
proached me to support some of
their, to me, prejudiced projects
or when they have sent expen-
sive propaganda, to which they
would have objected had it come
from the John Birch Society, to
my mail box at the University.

> You have heard perhaps on
television, on the evening of No-
vember 1, 1967, Mr. Eric Serva-
reid speak of students and their
activities in Latin America. If
so, you he-ard him say that dis-
senting students there have
achieved everything they Wish-
ed except a good education.

> I see you in a much worse
light. I believe the chance for
you to get a good education will
be maintained for a long time
in our open and generous socie-
ty in spite of your activities. But
I am concerned that in exercis-
ing what I believe to be the ty-
ranny of a minority you may
be permanently corrupted your--
self and may also injure the
spirit of what is still, for all of
its grave faults, the most demo-
cratic and just society now func-
tioning—-one which has careful-
ly protected your right to pro-
test against itzs-elf.

> I would much prefer to
spend my energy on that writ-
ing for which I have a modest
capability, and on that teaching
for which I have a full commit-
ment. I would be doing so now
but for the tyranny of the min-
Omy with which I think that
you and youriadvisers are threat.
ening me and a decent society.

Discusses His Novel

Dr. Chaim Potok, author of the Number 1 best seller,
The Chosen, will speak on his book to the University com-
munity tomorrow at noon in the Library of the YM & WHA.

Rabbi Potok’s novel The Chosen had a sensational his-
tory. The simple story of boys growing up in the Williams-
burg section of Brooklyn has captivated the imaginations of
hundreds of thousands of Americans because of the extraordinary
religious insight which Rabbi Potok has woven into his tale.

Rabbi Potok serves as Editorof the Jewish Publication Society
of America. He was born and raised in New York City. He was grad-
uated from Yishiva University in 1950 with a B. A. Summa cum laude
in English literature, then received a rabbinic ordination in 1954 from
the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, together with the Hebrew
Price and Homiletics Prize. He
served as national director of
the Laders Training Fellowship
from 1954 to 1955, and then en-
tered the US Army as a chap-
lain.

In Korea for 16 months, he
was with a medical battalion
and a front line combat engineer
battalion. Dr. Potok served as
director of Camp Ramah in Cali-
fornia and was also a member
of the faculty of the University
of Judaism in Los Angles. He
was in Philadelphia for ﬁve
years as Scholar-in-Residence at
Har Zion Temple, then spent a
year in Israel completing his
doctoral dissertation on philoso-
phy — receiving his doctorate
from the University of Penn-
sylvania in 1965.

In 1964-65, Dr. Potok was -on

Dr. Buck Presents Lecture;

Talks on EmpiricalContinuity  

by LARRY GLANZ

“A system forms a con-
tinuum if the consecutive
elements forming the sys-
tem cannot be distinguish-
ed.” Thus spoke Dr. Roger
Buck, chairman of the de-
partment of history and sci-
ence at the University of
Indiana, in his lecture Mon-
day on “Empirical Continu-
ity.”

To clarify his point, Dr. Buck
cited an experiment in which the
subject lifts three weights. He
ﬁnds that although he can di-
rect no noticeable, difference be-
tween the weights of the first
and second objects or between
the second and third, there is a
noticeable difference between

vative Judaism. He has written
numerous articles, reviews, and
stories which have been publish-
ed in various periodicals.

the ﬁrst and third.» The elements

are both distinct and indisting-
utishable. The system, in this
case the system of weights, can
be called continuous and the
elements "ordered.

There are two steps in the or-
dering of elements. First there
must be a resemblance between
two objects. Only in this way
can object-s qualify for mem-
bership in a group. That is, in-
dis-tinguishibilirty from a stan-
dard member of, a group is suf-
ﬁcient ctriterior for membership
in the group. Secondly, there
must be a third member which,
although not distinct from one
of the objects in the group, is
in fact just distinct from the
other. This concept Dr. Buck

@

labeled “discrimination space."
It takes into account the idea
of “just noticeable differences”
While allowing for the fact that
“classes of objects may overlap,
may indeed overlap to a great
degree."

The concept of em-pi-rical de-

termination of equality as deter-
mined by continuity. may be
l.'hl0"Llglh’l2 to be inconsistent with
the notion that two things which
are equal to a third thing are.
equal to each other.’ Dr. Buck
maintained that there was no
inconsistency and pointed out
that there is a diiference be-
tween, equality and indisting-
uishilbilixty and that this differ-
ence is exactly his concept of
dviscriminaitiorn space.

Grambling Students Protest,

College Suspends Demonstrators

GRAMBLING, La. (CPS) —
Grambnling College has suspend-
ed 25 students who have been
leading demonstriations a_nd
class strikes aimed at upgrad-
ing the “aciade-mic environment”
of the school and de-emphasiz-
ing sports.

I The students, 22 males and
three coeds, were given two
hours- to leave the campus.
Among these suspended were
the student body president and

the editor of the student news-
I paper.

The mass suispensio-n, how-
ever, did not end a student boy-
cott of classes which began las.t
Wednesday. The college, which
is predom.inately Negro, has a
total envrolslment of 4,200 stu-
dents, bu.t only 200 attended
classes Mo-nday. Student leaders
said the s-trike will continue in-
‘deﬁnitely;

The tense situation here last
week came to a head Saturday
when Louisiana Gov. John Mc-
Keithen ordered out 500 Nation-
al Guardsmen to blunt possible
student uproars. The troops nev-

K er arrived at the campus, but

are still standing by at Ruston,
a town six miles away.

The suspension of the student
leaders Monday came as a sur-
prise. The students were called
before a joint meeting of the
colﬂege’s Disciplinary Commit-
tee and the Interdepartmental
Coun-cil. '1‘hree min-utes after the
m-eetnig began the suspensions
were announced.

Three students are members
of the Disciplinary Committee,
but two of -them, the student
body president and vice-pres-L
dent, were among the 25 sus-
pended. Other members of the
committee are faculty members

I" F" and administrators.

Grambling President Ralph
Jones, who doubles as baseball
coach, refused to make any com-
ment on the week of demon-
strations. However, Noldan

Thomas, a member of a 12-man
faculty mediating group select-
ed by the students, character-
ized the school as ranking aca-
demically among the “lowest of
Negro colleges in the coun .”

***********************************n*****i*****************

Thomas said athletics are deﬁn-
itely o-verempihasized at Gramb-
ling. “Athletics are prioritized
in funds, the yearbook, and pub-
relations materials, and eve-n the
president has made the baseball
hall of fame.”

About 3,500 of the school's 4,-
200 students met in a mass rally
Sunday night and decided to
continue the boycott of "classes
this week. S-tudents said the
strike will continue until the-ir
demands of the admin-istration
are met.

Among other things, an or-

ganization which calls itself the
‘Informers
_I dismissal of seven Grambling
administrators. They have also

has‘ demanded the

demanded that President Jones
resign his other position as base-
ball coach. '

Other student demands are
that President Jones:

> Improve unsatisfactory con-
ditions in the realm of admin-
i-strative policy and see that the
academics get primary stress.

> Perform his duty without
prejudice and despotism and
eliminate his paternalistic views
of students.

'> See that students’ funds are
handled honestly.

> Stress political awareness

among faculty members and
students, “thus providing a
check on the white power struc-
ture in Baton Rouge.”

Grambling has a nation-wide
reputation for its athletic teams.
The school has produced a high
number of professional athletes,
among them Willie Davis of the
Green Bay Packers, Ernie Ladd
of the Kansas City Chieftains,
and Willis Reed of the New
York Knickerbockers;

October 28 was Homecoming
Day and more than 1,000 stu-
dents refused to sit in the
stands, preferring to remain un-
der the scoreboard. In addition,
the entire Homecoming Queen's

Court left their appointed places
to join the demonstrators.

Student body President Willie
Zanders said before his suspen-
sion, “This is not black power.
All we want is an education and
we aren't getting it. You cannot
get an education now at Gramb-
ling.”

Zanders also criticized Presi-
dent Jones for trying to play
down the signiﬁcance of the stu-
dent protests. “In spite of the
demonstrations _being non - vio-
lent, the president of the college
has pegged us as a group of 150
radicals when we have actually
had as many as 2,500 and 3,000
participants,” he said.

Students at the Homecoming
game Saturday chanted “Presi-
dent told a lie, president told a

lie,” referring to a statement by '

Jones that only 150 students
were involved. ,

Flacul-ty member '-.I"vh~om»as said
-most faculty support for the
students has been quiet. “Few
have expressed any vocal com-
ments, and that is due to fear
of l-osing their jobs.” He added
that the local chaptieir of the
American Association for Uni-
versity Professors is living a
token exi.stence.

“We have a few very good
students," Thomas explained,
“but mo-st of them are from a
very poor background,’ and the
majority operate on a sub-col-
legiia-te «level -in terms of n-ation-
al norms.”

VVhile he admitted most of the
students demands are valid, he
said some of ‘ them cannot be
met immediately. But he added,
“all of them ought to be looked
into.”

Dean-of Instruction E. L. Oolle,
whom Thomas describes as one
of G-rar,nb1ing’s “truly ﬁne schol-
ars,” expressed doubt that the
students were really concerned
about “academic excellence.”

Cole "further termed the ath-
letics‘ question a “whipping boy”
and added that there is an over-
emphasis on athletics all across
the country. “Grambling doesn't
emphasize athletics any more
than other colleges in the South
or elsewhere in the country.”

He said Gnambling has 80 ath-
letic scholarships and 80 merit
scholarships, plus a few other
partial, specialized stipends.

Students leading the protest,
he said, do not have the aca-
demic credentials of the real
scholars who hold these grants.

According to student govern-
ment Vice-president Kenneth Ar-
mand the protests are merely a
continuation of steps taken in
the spring of 1966 to get changes
made. They were followed up
last year, he said, when Presi-
dent Jones reportedlyagreed un-

ulty course evaluation.

No-thing yet has been done
about the evaluation. An earlier
evaluation was discontinued in

Language Professor Comments

University Theat er Presents
De Vega, Spain’s Finest

by JOHN LIHANI
(Lihani is asociate professor of

Hispanic Languages and
Literature.) _
One of the greatest, most

versatile and certainly most
prolific dramatists that has
ever lived, Lope de Vega,
will have two of his plays
presented by the University

 . of Pittsburgh Theatre.

Lope, as he is fondly referred

' to by students of the Spanish

drama, depicted the life and
-times of his 17th century Spain
so faithfully that he created a
Span.ish national theatre. He
created it in the sense that This
plays set a pattern, a formula,
for other dramatists to follow,
an-d it was national in that it
it treated nattional themes: Span-
ish conquests, heroes, kings,

 . princesses and commoners alike,

but above all, it dealt with Span-
ish contemporary life. His plays
were like toda-y’s newspapers, «a
reﬂection of their community.
The Lope dramatic formula
stipulated that plays be written
in‘ polymevtric poetry, in three
acts——a tho-usand lines-to an act,
and on themes which stir the
heart and the soul. There was a
fusion of action and lyricism in
his plays -to a degree which has
seldom been encountered in the
wo-rks of other dramatists. Lope,

i like his contemporary, Shake-s-~

pe-are, was the most popular
playwright in his coun-try dur-
ing his career.

It is said that Lope could
write a three act play in 24
hours.. He produced his ﬁrst full-
leﬁgiﬁ Blzry’ wires he was iii his
early teens. He could compose
verse as quickly as a modern
day business man can dictate
his business letters. This was,
after all, Lope’s everyday busi-
ness. He would produce plays
weekly, almost daily for the de-

. manding Madrid audience of the

day. New themes, new stories-—
ever new and ever the same —
were earnestly sought after.
Lope sensed the needs of the
public intuitively, and like Mo-
liere, who occasionaly borrowed
ideas from him, he knew how to
give the public what it wanted.

This almost feverish demand

~ left us a le-gacy of an unbeliev-

ably huge number of plays.
Some scholars are of the opin-
ion that the number of his plays
approximates 2,000. Most of the
plays by Lope have been lost,

. for he did not write for publica-

tion but rather for performance,

for the purpose of making mon-

ey, and his manuscripts would
pass from hand to hand until
they were worn out -or other-
wise destroyed. Over a thousand
titles of his plays have been doc-

ument-ed, and some 500 plays
have come down to our day in
complete form. Many of these
are gems of the theatre, such as
Fuenteovejuna, El Perro del
Hortelano (The Dog in the Man-
ger), and El Castigo Sin Ven-
ganza (Justice without Revenge).
It is only the theatrical genius
of this man that could permit
him to produce great works
with such seeming ease and rap-
idity, for he had li-ttle precious
time too polish them. Still one
must confess that they-needed
little polishing, for he was an
inherently polished poet and dra-
matist.

He ex-celled -in both the serious
drama and the light, comic “cape
and sword” play, which parti-
cularly fulﬁlled the desire for
action and intrigue on the stage.
Indeed, it may be a permissible
exaggeration to say that one can

ﬁnd in his works virtually any"

and every human-istic idea imag-
inable. Cervantes, seeking to
compete with Lope in the thea-
tre (fortunately for the novel,
unsuccessfull), admirably re-
marked on Lope’s ability by
calling him “n-ature’s monster.”
The dramatist’s facility in cre-
ating tragic as well as comic
scenes is well illustrated by the
two plays chosen for presenta-
tion by the University’s theatre
group.

Though some of Lop-e’s plays
have been made into ﬁlms, they
likewise continue to ﬂourish on
the stage, not only in Spanish
speaking countries, but also in
English, Russian and Czech,
among other languages.

Lope specialized "in the pre-
sentation of the themes of hon-
or, patriotism, religion, ﬁlial de-
votion and love, for he believed
that they tend to move the
heart. Yet his own Don Juanes-
que life of 1ove and action did
not generally coincide with the
exemplary characters he depict-
ed on the stage. In his old age
he seems to have been over-
whelmed with remorse. Al-

to call could notice spots of
blood on the walls of h-is cell.
This was a paradox of a man,
but a paradox that is often con-
sidered typical of the Spanish
character. Spain has paid hom-
age to him in many ways over
the years. One of the lesser ones
is naming a Madrid street on
which Cervantes dwelt “Lope
de Vega.” Paradoxically, the
street on which Lope’s home
stands today as a museum is
named after Cervantes. '

Lope’s intention was to give
the public what it Wanted.. His
plays are as exciting as they
were in the 17th century.

Professor of Education,
Maurice Thomas, Dies

Dr. Maurice J. Thomas, professor of education and
chairman of the University’s Department of Educational
Administra.tior.. died Saturday night, in Presbyterian-Uni-

versity Hospital.

Dr. Thomas, 65, of 133 Martin Road, Scott Township,
was in his 40th year as an educator and a widely-known
expert in the field of pvlbllc school administration.

Dr. Thomas joined the University’s Department of Education in
1948, having served five years as superintendent of schools in Roches-
ter, Minnesota, and 17 years as teacher and administrator of various

schools in the state of Washington.

The late educator was a specialist in the problems of planning,
financing and administering public education. In a. 1961 volume ap-

praising the needs of secondary education in

Pennsylvania, Dr.

Thomas advocated a network of state-supported junior co-lleges, a.
consolidation of the smaller school districts, and the removal of school
administration from political influence.

He maintained that the election of school directors should be on
a nonpartisan basis. “In electing a man to a school board parents
should not have to consider his political party but his qualifications,”

Dr. Thomas once said.

DAVE HART
Needs CharLcellor’s Help

CHANCELLOR POSVAR
An avid football fan

No one knew what Chancellor Wesley Posvar was going
to say last Friday at the Varsity Lettermen’s Banquet. All
anyone knew was that the Chancellor would make public
his views on Pitt’s athletic situation for the first time and
that his views were crucial.

Posvar began his speech by declaring, “I am a football

fan

“I remember Pitt’s nati-onal reputation in athletics
years ago when I was a student in Cleveland,” Posvar said.
“Now Pitt has a national academicgreputation. Our prob-
lem is to raise our level of athletics to our competition
without losing academic values.”

The Chancellor then restated the problem and hinted
at a course of action. “We want two things at Pitt,” he
said. “We want first class academics and first class ath-
letics. We Want to win, and we will do‘ what is necessary

- and proper to bring this about.”

In his brief talk, Posvar cited two areas that would
receive consideration. “We’re modifying our football sched-
ule in a way that will be satisfactory to everyone here,” he
revealed. “Among the schools we’ve added are Tulane, Air
Force, Northwestern, Duke, North Carolina, William &
Mary and Georgia Tech.

“We’re keeping our traditional rivals: Syracuse, Penn
State, Army, Navy, West Virginia, and Notre Dame,” he
added.

Then the Chancellor disclosed that there would be an
increase in aid to student athletes. Since student athletes
already receive full scholarships, an “increase in aid”
could mean only one thing; an incease in the number of

it scholarships available. .

____Coach Dave Hart has been fighting fo-r a change in the
current agreement with Penn State, Syracuse, and West
Virgina since he’s been here. That agreement, signed five
years ago, limits the four schools to 25 football scholarships
per year.

And after reading the Associated Press account of
statements by Auburn coach Ralph Jordan this past week,
it’s no wonder why Hart has been fighting so hard. Jordan
told the Montgomery Quarterback club that unless South-
eastern Conference presidents raise limits on the number
of football scholarships, independents will dominate the
game in the South. _ _

Jordan. said that SEC schools are limited to 40 foot-
ball scholarships annually, and that. some conference
schools have said they couldn’t live with that limit. Those
schools have become independents. '

The Auburn coach cited Georgia Tech ar_id,T‘1;1l9.1’1€,
two of the schools Chancellor Posvar listed on Pitts mod-
ified” schedule. Jordan said, “Georgia Tech signed 07
players for its freshman team this season and Tulane had
-more than 50.” ‘  _

He continued, “Florida State, always an independent,
signed 71. And Miami and Memphis St. won’t tell you how
many they signed, which makes you wonder. O _

Can the Eastern schools fairly compete against Georgia
Tech’s 57 with their 25 1’ The aiiswere is obvious to every-
one including the Chancellor. _

,Svracuse coach Ben Schwartzwalder confided the lim-
it hurt even his lirograin. “We have ’to use our freshmen
to scrimmage our varsity. lt slioiildnt be that W3.V but I
can’t fight it. ()ur president won t change It, S9 1 173V‘? to
live with it. Maybe the other three presidents will do some-
thing.” _ .

Chancellor Posvar has hinted very StY'0Y1g1.V that Pltt

will «vet out of the agreement it had no business making

with schools of lower academic Standards in the f11‘Sl3 Place-A

 
       

 

 

 

Defensive Prowler

w..-W... November 8, 1967 —— min Pm NEWS —— Page 9“

Joe Cortin Bowls Them Over,

Then Begins His “Run For Life” ‘A

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Sports Editor
Amiable Joe Curtin wanted to kid about it, but Dave

Hart wouldn’t let him.

So Curtin just sat there, and watched. Rick Cassata
goes back to pass and throws it right at Curtin; Curtin drops it. Rick

Cassata goes back to pass .

. . Over and over again, the Syracuse

films were run, “thirty times it seemed,” said Joe. But never once
did he catch the pass for an interception.

When the ball hit him, Curtin
looked shocked. “Maybe I was,
but I don’t know. I’ve blown
three like that this year. I guess
I just act like I have palsey
when the ball comes.”

“There’s no doubt, I should
have had it,” he -said.

Even Hart thought Curtain
caught the pass. ‘‘All I could see
was a clear ﬁeld ahead of him,
and I began ﬁguring out which
two-point conversion play we
would use after the touchdown,”
he said after the game.

Hart wasn't mad though for
he may have also thought back
to the Larry Csonka -collision.
Maybe, Curtin still felt the ef-
fects of what happens when a
5-11, 195 pound defensive half-
back rams -head-on into a 6-4,
230 pound full-back.

“I remember what happened,
yet I don't remember what hap-
pened,” said Joe with a smile,
almost not believing what he
had just said.

“I just know I always run
for my life out there,” joked
Joe.

For Curtin, into

ALTHOUGH HE is not very big, Jove‘ Curtin is one of the hardest

runners is as much an o-ccur-
rence on Saturday afternoon-s,
as covering receiveirs. He al-
ways hits them low, “its easier
to bowl them over than trying
to tackle, or grab them,” he
explained.

Defensively, Curtin is tabbed
the Prowler in . the Panthers’
four-man secondary which is
coached by the youngest mem-
ber of Hart’s staff, Bill Lewis.

Curtin’s baisic duty is topirowl,
naturally. “I have at least eight
different ~pnosiiti.ons where I can
line up. Basically though, I al-
ways go to the side where two
receivers line up,” explained
Joe. “It’s sorta like a free safe-
ty.”

Except for the Syracuse game,
and as yet the N otre Dame
game Siatu-rdiay, Curtin works
from a halfback rotiaition pat-
tern to cover split side wing-
backs o-r ends. It’s been this
way for Curtin, the last two
years.

But like many defensive backs,
Curtin began his career carry-
ing the ball. “Anyone who has

tacklers on the -varsity. Here Curtin drives into Miami quarterback
David Olivo in the first quarter of that game.

it. But it doesn’t mean that much
to .be now. Last year, Bobby
Dyer and I were needed on de-
fense. So we did our job be-

cause we were needed,” Joe  .

closed.

Curtin has gotten over his
halfbiack dreams, “and now 'he
speaks like a veteran._ “People
talked about us this year, es-
pecially after that Miamii game.
Everything was hard then. We
were going down the drain,”
said Joe.

“But we are maturing now,
an-d it’s not just the young guys
either, it’s the whole team.
We’re still n-ot satisﬁed through.
We want to play better,” he
said. .
“And it’s hard to tell you
about our defense, the guys I
mean . . .” Joe stopped short.
Then he thought of N otre Dame.

“You know, when we went

down there last year, people

asked us, ‘Did you really show
up?”’ Joe related.

“I can’t really describe it, but
they're a funny team. Just their
name means so much, and it’s
enough to get up for.”

Sunday, Curtin again will look
at the game ﬁlms. He -hopes he
sees Han-ra-tty back to pass, and
throwing night to Curtin, who
runs for a touchdown. Over and
over again.

Gridders Drill For Notre Dame;
Hart Dismisses “Let — Down” Talk

Dave Hart was in a phil-
osophical mood. After two
tough losses in a row, and
with Notre Dame coming up,
perhaps that’s the best way to
be.

The losses to Navy and Syra-
cuse are bound to have some
effect on the Panthers. Many
people do not believe that they
will be able to sustain the type
of attitude that carried them to
those two great, but losing per-
formances.

Dave Hart is not one of those
people. “If you can't get them
up for Notre Dame, then who
can you get them up for?” he
reﬂected.

Conﬁdent that the Panthers
will once again rise to the occa-
sion, Hart went on to discuss
other vital concerns, namely the

 

strategy against the Fighting
Irish.

“Notre Dame is the second
best team in the country from
what I’ve seen,” he said. “South-
ern Cal is the best. “We’ll have
to really be prepared for this
one.”

Against Syiracuise, the Pan-

‘thers abandoned their normal

4-3 front for «a 5-3, in order to
stop harry Csonka. With No-tre
Dame displaying their vaunted
aerial game, it would be expect-
ed that Hart would return to
his normal defense.

“Not necessarily,” he said. “Of
course we can’t give Terry Han-
ratty the ﬂats the way we gave
them to Syracuse, or he'll real-
ly burn us.”

Hart intends to do some of

the things Purdue did against

the Irish, add some things the

Panthers did last year, and mix
this with some new wrinkles.
“I thought Purdue did the best
job against them defenisively.
But, I also thought some of the
things that we did last year
were real good.

The Panthers will be boosted
by the return of George Mediich,
regular tight end and punter,
who missed the Syracuse game
with the ﬂu, and with ‘a bruised
snhoullder.

“The most l‘m’p0'I'lla-ht thing,”
he noted, “is that we have to
get the same aggressiveness we
did the last two wee-ks.”
most aggressive of the defend-

ers, senior tackle Dave Driake,

to this week’s Alil-East team, the

  Plusquellic, Beinecke

Pair of Cubs Return
To Den Friday at OSU

by IVIIKE BROURMAN

L Oldtimers in’ Columbus talk about the “good old days”
of Ohio State football; that era recorded memorably by

James Thurber when the Buckeyes were the kingpins of the Big 10.
There was a day when no good Ohio football player escaped the

State dragnet.

Those days are now gone, and
the frosh football team has two
-players who can attest to that.
Don Plusquellic was an All-State
choice at quarterback for Ken-
.more High in Akron. Bill Bein-
ecke was “an All-Conference se-

'lect=ion at Au-stintown-Fitch in

Youngst-own.

Ohio State, the fresh gridders
next opponent, was interested
in both, but neither considered
the Big Ten ‘school. And one of
the major reasons is the brand
of football preached by coach
Woody Hayes.

“I really believe that our brand
of football is better than the
type that Woody Hayes plays,”
said Beinecke, a 230 pound tac-
kle. Plusquellic virtually echoed
his words, with the difference
being one of position—quarter-
backs like to (pass once in a
while.

“I didn’-t want to just hand
the ball off to the fullback, like
Woody Hayes’ other quarter-
backs do.” According to Don, a
lot of other Ohio /schoolboy sig-
nal-callers agree with him, one
of the reasons for the Buckeyes
de-,cl'ine of late.

At Kenmore, Plusquellic quar-
terbacked a wide-open offense.
“It was 50 per cent passing,
straight rol1ou.t. I didn't run
much. If -a «guy Wasn't open, I’d
try and hesitate and wait for
him.”_

Beinecke also played for a
team with a mixed offense. You
normally wouldn’t think a line-
man would worry too much
about whether the team ever

passed, but Bill expressed doubts
over the “Three yards and a

cloud of dust” theory, and gave

other reasons why he chose the
University.

“I thought I’d get a chance
to play -as a sophomore, and
that's important. Then too, I
knew Pitt was on the upswing
under coach Hart. And they play

L the best schools in the country.”

Both Bill and Don are also
impressed with the University
academically. “I thought that
Pitt had a lot to offer,” Plus-
quellic explained. “Not only is
the football big-time, but you
can get ‘a good education. Schools
like Miami and Alabama don’t
offer you much except football.”
Beinecke also stressed the aca-
dem-ic aspect.

If Plusquellic and Beinecke
are Woody Hayes’ loss, then
they are Dave Hart's gain, and
he is happy to have them.

“Don is very quick, and cool
back there,” Hart noted. “He's
got good wrist action in his de-
livery. He’s a good runner. He's

done very well in the scrim-_

mages -against the varsity.”
“Bill has impressed us great-
ly,” Hart continued. “He has
real good size, and he moves
better than we had even expect-
ed him to. We expect big things

throw a block. Both Beinecke and Plusquellic are

the Cubs meet the Ohio State Acorns at Columbus.

 

Game at Ohio State

Friday, the freshman foot-
ball team visits Ohio State
for a game that could help
answer -the inevitable question:
How good can the Cubs play?

Ohio State promises to be a
strong opponent, and a good test
for the Cub defense. Woody
Hayes feels that his recruits this
year represent his ﬁnest crop of
freshmen since he’s been coach-
ing at Ohio State. And Woody
has been at Ohio State for 17
years.

In their only game this year,

the Acorns displayed a strong

“I don’t -mean to sound cocky

“But, if everybody plays up to
their potential then I don’t see
how we can lose.”

James Thurber would have
loved that.

ted 370 yards while limiting the
Hoosiers to 85 yards.

The Cubs can expect to face
a talented backfield that gained
333 yards on the ground. Full-
back Jack Tatum and tailback
Larry Selina each scored once
in their college debuts, while
quarterback Rex Kern ran for
two additional touchdowns.

The Cub defense is healthy;
linebacker John Wozniak and
tackle Tom Porreca will be ready
for Friday’s game. The offense
is as healthy as could be expect-
ed.

Fullback Tony Esposito, re-
covering from a torn rib cartil-
age that he suffered against
Penn State, is still wearing a
red shirt at the practices; but
he will probably see action. How-
ever, Phil Sgrignoli, a 5-11, 205
pound recruit from Harrisburg,
is scheduled to start in his place.

“Sgrignoli will start at full-
back,” explained coach Darrell
Lewis, “but Esp-osito should he

. able to play a little also.

Tailback Mike Connell is also
hurt, but he’~l-1 be able to start.
His ankle is sprained and his
leg is bruised.

“He'll be ready for Ohio State,”
said Lewis. ‘‘He’s just a little
sore now.”

With game time just two days
away, the Cubs seems up for
the game.

ated Lloyd Weston, “real bad.”

HA! HAI). Nevertheless, here
is their scouting report, as di-
cip-hered from the smoke signals
sent out from James Mal1oy’s
cigars:

The “KC‘s” offense is led by .

quarterback Dick Shore, a bumb-
ling idiot whose main shortcom-
ing is a tendency to complete
more passes to the opposition
than to his own teammates. The
backﬁeld consists of “Deadly”
Denny Tovback and Ted “The
Terror” Weiss, whose main
method of keeping out oppos-
ing rusihe-rs is their underarm
odor. They are capabvly backed
by Steve Kundra and Prestin
Kno-bliach, both of Whom have
bad breath.

The line is centered around
Bob “The Toe” Fres-chi, who is
not to be mistaken for Jim Rin-
go who is an inch taller. The
ﬂiat, er ﬂeet footed receiving
corps includes Gary “The Gust”
Meckler, Jim “The Jersey Jet”
O’Connell, and “Hy Ric.”

The heart of the “KC’s” is the
defense, and with the rest of the
team being what it is, they real-
ly need a heart. Unkind observ-
ers, however, have reported that
the defense resembles not so
much a heart as an inﬂamed
appendix.

K Tex Mawl: Hawks vs WPGH Scouting Report
“Killer - Cycle” Profile Amazin’ Hawks Demand Perfection

Are the Pitt News “Hawks”
really stronger than dirt. That
question will be answered this
Sunday when the “Hawks” meet
the WPGH “Killer-Cycles” (also
known as the Sorry-Sockets),
one of the dirtiest (in an un-
clean sense) teams around.

All week long, the Killer--Cy-
cles have been chanting “Kill
the ‘Hawks,’ Kill the ‘Hawks,’’’
but this has failed to perturbe
the staunch leader of the birds,
Jay “Flatbush,” Rosenste-in.

“If they want to play dirty,
we’ll be ready for them,” boast-
ed the Kid from Brookyln. “Why,
if things get rough in there, we
may even play the ‘Hawk’ both
ways.”

“Flatbush” was referring to
his aging, but nevertheless de-
crepid middle linebacker Mike
“Hawk” Bourman. But, there
are other “Hawks” who are cap-
able of playing dirty pool
pool. George “Moustachio” Lies
does it all the time. When he
gets a chance.

And Dan “The Baron” Book-
er is known far and wide (most-
ly wide) for his underhanded
maneuvers. Then there is Dave
“GI” Tiernan who is trying to
snowball a poor 17-year-old girl
into believing that he is only
18. How about them apples?

Meanwhile, “Fla-tbusih” has
hinted that he may take a more
active role in this week’s game.

but this is a different story,” he
s-aid. “Flatbush’s” presence on
the bench was no doubt" aided
by -the bottle of gin that he kept
by his side on those rare occa-

mouth. '

“Flatbush” also announced
that the “Hawks” will hold-only
light drills this week. “Today
we’ll work against the Steelers

Carrying a 200 pound barbell.
Saturday we take it real easy
with a 30 mile jog and 200 wind

You can do both at N OL

             

if you are an engineer in the top third of your class or a scientist in the top quarter
of your class, NOL offers you the opportunity to begin your career in one of the world's
great laboratories and, at the same time, go ahead with your plans for graduate study.

NOL is a laboratory in the true meaning of the word, and
one of the largest and best-equipped laboratories in the
world. It is the nation's leading R&D establishment for
Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), the Navy's principal high
speed aeroballistics activity, and a leader in the develop-
ment of new air and surface weapons. The spectrum of
research at NOL ranges from nuclear effects to acoustics
to explosives and materials. At NOL, weapons development
is carried through from inception to design to prototype
test and development. Since 1950, NOL has completed 209
new weapons and devices such as SUBROC, nuclear depth
bombs, mines, projectile fuzes, underwater detection sys-
tems, and components and design data for POLARIS,
TARTAR, TALOS, TERRIER, ATLAS and TITAN missiles. A
civilian staff of over 3,000 people includes more than 1,000
professional engineers and scientists—-experts with na-
tional and international reputations. Extensive and unique
facilities embrace wind tunnels operating to Mach 17,
hypervelocity ballistic ranges, the world's most exceptional
hydroballistic facility, shock tunnels, 300g centrifuge . . .
multi-million-dollar experimental facilities.

Here is your opportunity. Each year, NOL interviews out-
standing engineering and science graduating students.
Selects the handful that seems to be really creative. Takes
them to its beautiful 875-acre “campus" (the front yard
is a golf course) in the rolling hills of Maryland near the
Nation's Capital. Puts them through an optional one-year
professional development course with rotational assign-
ments to various areas within the Laboratory to prepare
them for permanent assignments.

From the very beginning, new staff members have an oppor-
tunity to contribute directly to significant projects . . . to
be part of an organization where groups are small and
emphasis is on the individual.

NOL offers you a: graduate studyprogram that is one of
the largest and most productive programs in the country.
Each yearfmembers of our professional staff receive M.S.’s
or Ph.D.’s through this program. NOL has a significant ad-
vantage in its proximity to the University of Maryland. Many
NOL staff members hold permanent part-time positions on
the Maryland faculty, and graduate level courses are taught
at NOL every semester. Maryland also offers many courses
on its own campus—only minutes away——at times which
are convenient to and keyed to the special requirements
of NOL.
