Freshman Honors Program Planned

:.

By VIJAY JAIN

The University is working with a major insur-
ance company on a plan to provide a large num-
.-ber of apartments in the Oakland area, mainly for

‘ {the University faculty.

A story printed in the Sunday Pittsburgh Press
disclosed that the new housing would be in Craig
Avenue, the Upper Hill and other
ing the University’s campus. An initial cost of $22,-
500,000 has been estimtead for the project.

F The apartments, though primarily for the fac-

ulty, would also accommodate students, and non-
university personnel. The housing project would be
undertaken by a proﬁt-making corporation which
would maintain the buildings and pay taxes on
them. The apartment program is co-ordinated with

both the University and Oakland
renewal.

Details Not Released
The details for the proposed scheme have not
been oliicially released. though it is known that of-
ﬁcials of the Prudential Life Insurance Co. recently
attended a board of trustees meeting at ‘the Uni-

versity. 1

According to a re—organization plan, the Uni-
versity will have a staff of 3,975 employees by

1980. A survey conducted by

showed that 1,200 to 1,600 of the staff members
would like to live in the vicinity of the campus.
At present the University has virtually no facility

for faculty housing.

Last fall, when the master plan was drawn,
University officials planned to provide housing for

25 per cent of 1980. staff. The of-
ﬁcial pointed out that it is not
necessary for the University to
own all the land for the faculty

Acquiring Property

The University has, however,
begun to acquire property in the
Allequippa Street area, which is
slated for renewal under the mas-
ter plan. In addition, the master
plan speciﬁcally suggests the
Neville-Craig-Center Avenue area
for high rise apartments.

In addition to an increase in

“-designed to meet the needs of
students with unusual promise of
intellectual activity and academic
achievement.” ,~

Approximately 50 freshmen,
who will be expected to work
“extra hard,” will be invited to
enter the program. It will be
later expanded to include sopho-
mores, juniors and seniors.

Detesmined by Tests

Freshmen will be selected for
the program on the basis of Na-
tional Merit Scholarship tests and
College Entrance Examination
scores. Certain students will also
be selected by interview with a
University faculty panel.

The honors program will in-
clude classes which concentrate
on studying material from orig-
inal sources rather than texts.
For the first two years of the
program, the participants will
partake in special seminars as
well as regular classes.

The last two years of the pro-
gram will be similar to graduate
programs in which students will
do much original research and
individual area study.

Includes Optional Paper

Before graduation, each student
will take a thorough test to de-
termine whether or not he will
graduate with honors. Some de-
partments may require a paper
demonstrating the student’s aca-
demic abilities.

Five departments have begun
honors programs and all others
are expected to join in the near
future. Those which are carry-
ing the program now are philo-
sophy, political science, English,
history and chemistry.

Students who enter the pro-
gram are under no obligation to

‘Project Talent’ Results
Study American Youth

Preliminary ﬁndings of Project
TALENT, a study of the identifi-
cation, development, and utiliza-
tion of the talents of American
youth, have recently been released
by the University.

The program was conducted in
March 1960, in 1353 secondary
schools selected to represent the

high schools of the United States. -

Over a period of two school days.
approximately 2000 questions were
answered by some 440,000 stu-
dents. These answers provided the
basic data for the project.

Planning for this program be-
gan in 1957 and involved the par-
ticipation of thirty of the nation’s
leading experts in problems of
testing, «counseling and guidance,
manpower and sociology, and edu-
cational research. ~

Announced at Meetings
Findings of the project were an-

nounced yesterday at the meeting ’

of the American Educational. Re-

A search Association and the Amer-

ican Association of School Admin-
istrators being held in Atlantic
City, New Jersey.

Dr. John C. Flanagan, pro-

fessor of Psychology here at the ‘

University, reported on the

A Project and /on its implications
for American secondary school
education.

The primary purpose of the pro-
gram was to obtain a better un-
derstanding of American youth.
Project TALENT’, sought to dis-
cover the patterns of talents of

‘young people in the rural areas,

in the big cities, in. cheap apart-
ments, in residential areas, in the
deep South, and in the Middle
West. Educational opportunities,

and counseling
services were also appraised by
the project.

Rates Students

The results of the program may
help to determine the competence
of American high school graduates
in the use of basic tool subjects.

Test scores in reading, spell-
ing and arithmetic will be re-
ported in meaningful terms to
parents and teachers who will
be able to use these ﬁgures as
a measure of student perform-
ance. A

For example, In English the
project found that of the 5,000
most frequently used words in the
English language, the average
high school senior was able to
spell 92.5 per cent of them cor-
rectly. Also, the same average
senior was able to apply the rules
of capitalization correctly in 90
per cent of the cases.

_ Magazines Used

Test questions were also devel-
oped to discover the student’s un-
derstanding of certain articles in
popular American magazines. The
results ranged all the way from
a 78 per cent comprehension for
articles in motion picture maga-
zines such as Modern Screen and
Silver Screen to a 28 per cent
comprehension of The Atlantic
Monthly and the Saturday Review.

The same descending trend in
comprehension was discovered
when the writings of well-
known authors were compared
with those of the typical classic
novelists.

Other facts regarding mathe-
matics’ process, scientific knowl-
edge, and generals high school
characteristics were revealed by
the project.

Mathematics 
Dept. Adopts
‘Split’ Term

The mathematics department of
the University will operate under
the split trimester system during
the spring session this year.

The department adopted the
split system which will be used
in all state universities and col.-
leges in Florida.

Under the new system, the 15
week trimester will be divided
into two seven and a half week
sections. Students, therefore, sen-

and some exceptional underclass-
men, will be able to take either
two sequential courses, or take the
second part of a course which
they were not able to ﬁt into their
schedules previously.

Under the split trimester. col-
lege teachers would be accom-
odated who would not ordi-
narily be able to attend the
spring session.

The first part of the trimester
will extend from April 26 to June
15, and the second part. from June
18 to Aug. 8.

The curriculum will also be
divided. Undergraduates will be
able to take one of four courses,
115, 137, 141, or 155, during the

three courses, 133, 135, or 154,
during the second half.
Graduates will be offered
course number 209 during the
first half, and a choice of course
numbers 210, 255, or 291, during
th second half.

In addition to this a series
of evening students may take
either 213 or 277 during the ﬁrst
half, and may have a choice of

The WPDU debaters’ overall
record of six wins and two losses
was sufficient to give them a tie
for first place, however the tie
was broken on the basis of 5985*‘

HypnotiSmBecomes Popular

Physician Comments on H ypnosis, Uses: Research,
Psychological‘Inquiry, Therapy, Entertainment

By FREDVMARCUS
Hypnosis is becoming a subject
of extensive general interest, said

Dr. Joseph S. Silverman, a .cesi- ,

dent physician at the Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic.
He was commenting on the movies
on hypnosis recently shown at
WPIC.

“For instance,” he said, “tele-

vision is enthralled with it. Dur-_

ing the last week alone, hypnosis
could be found on‘ “Dr. Kildare,”
“The Defenders,” “The Twilight
Zone,” and “The Garry Moore
Show.” .

“Even though the weather was
last Wednesday evening,
many people were present at the
movie (after which Dr. Richard
A. Hilo, a practicing psychiatrist,
Dr. Abraham J. Twerski, a resi-
dent physician at WPIC, and Dr.
Silverman participated in a dis-
cussion on hypnosis).”

Examines Mind

“Hynosis,” said Dr. Silverman,
“should be properly understood,
It is not a treatment, but an in-

strument of psychological inquiry,
or research, to determine the
properties of the mind.
“Commercial hypnotists,” he
added, “deal with the patient’s
symptoms. The “yellow page
hypnotist” offers -to conquer
your fears through hypnother-
apy. The body, however, has a
certain psychological economy.
Thus this should be the job of
professional men alone.”

He mentioned that certain ideas
held by the public about hypnosis
should be modiﬁed somewhat. For
instance, a_ person who is under
hypnosis does not necessarily have
to appear drowsy. Hypnosis re-
actions can be conditioned so that
some may appear drowsy, others
alert. '

Has Limitations

Also, hypnosis does not add any-
thing to the body physiology —
that is, telling someone under
hypnosis that he will do the ﬁve
hundred yard dash in ﬁve sec-
onds would not, in’ itself, give him

Book Review

Scheduled
This Afternoon

Ivo Andric’s Nobel Prize win-

ning novel “The Bridge on the‘

Drina” will be reviewed this aft-
ernoon in the Fine Books Room
of the University Book Center.

The book will be reviewed by
Harry J. Mooney, Jr., of the Eng-
lish department, who has just
completed work on his doctorate
at the University. The review is
scheduled for 4:15 p.m.

Dealingiwith three and a half
centuries of tumnultous history,
“The Bridge on the Drina” is the
first volume of a triology. It was
published in Yugoslavia in 1945.

Dr. Andric was cited by the
Swedish Academy “for the epic
force with which he has depicted
themes and human destinies
drawn from this history of his

' country.”

Dr. Mooney has taught “Con-
temporary American and British
Fiction” and “Survey of Major
British Fiction.” Currently he is
teaching “European Fiction.”

His master’s thesis, which was
entitled “Katherine Ann Porter,”
was published by the,Uni_versity
of Pittsburgh Press in 1957 as one
of its paperback series in modern
literature.

accomplish in the special program
may also be attributed to regular
curriculum credits.

cerning the new program may.

"“nours :1 dayswill be devoted to

instruction, and three hours to a
language lab where materials
will be given to help in learning
the material taught in the class-
room and help in pronounciation.

The signiﬁcance of the use of
Chinese was expressed in the Na-
tional Defense Education Act
passed by the United States Gov-
ernment. This act provides as-
sistance’ to universities that teach
certain subjects important to na-
tional security. These courses fall
into the areas of math, science,
and foreign languages.

“Chinese should not be any
more diﬂicult,” Dr. Chu D said,"
“than any other language to any
student with a normal language
aptitude. It is easier than western
languages because you do not
have ot worry about conjugating
verbs of gender." In Chinese you
use the same verb for the past,
present, and future. The only
difﬁculty would be in writing the
characters and in the thinking.”

the added strength to do this.

Third, during the period of
hypnosis, the person may enter
into an autistic state, which is
characterized by attention to
fantasy, or daydreaming, rather
than reality.

However, there are also other
facets at the su1‘t‘ace'of hypnosis.
“When someone,” Dr. Silverman
said, “goes to Dr.
shows his conﬁdence in that doc-
tor. And,the hypnosis itself is
characterized by an interpersonal
relationship between the hypno-
tist and the subject.”

Dr. Martin Orne, a professor at
Harvard, who presented his views
in last Wednesday’s movie, sug-
gested a follower-leader relation-
ship. Dr. Milo, on the other hand,
calls this relationship a coopera-
tive endeavor, a certain mutuality.
This is the predominant view to-.
day. ‘ i

“This,” Dr. Silverman conclud-
ed, “is the role and state of hyp-
nosis today —— interest in it is
growing.” S ‘

Major Housing

to have about 11,740 full time
students within the next 20
years and plans on campus
housing for 6885 of them. This
would 'mean an additional 3784
units.

Off-street parking is also a ma-
jor source of concern, in addition
to the housing facility problem
for the faculty. and students, and
will receive attention under the
plan. .
PR Director Comments

When asked to comment on the
story printed in the Press, Russel
R. Jalbert, the director of Public
Relations Oﬂice, reported that “the
University has been, for a long
time, interested in providing the
faculty with an oﬁ-campus hous-
ing program.”

Jalbert added that the Uni-
versity is exploring the possi-
bilities of such a housing proj-
ect with several companies in
addition to the Prudential Life
Insurance Co. which was men-
tioned in the Press. No decision
has, however, been made as yet.

_The University is interested in
carrying out the housing plan with
as little drain on its resources as
possible, Jalbert explained, thus

 

the negotiations with the various
private agencies.

ever, according to Student Gov-
ernment public relations chair-
man, Sam Zacharias, ‘‘lack of in-

body forced cancellation of this
vote.” The student vote was to
narrow the candidates to ﬁve girls,
but only five were nominated.
Based on Appearance
Since this contest was to be

based strictly on pictures and not
on personality, the committee de-
cided. that local merchants would
select the winner,” Zacharias ex-
, “We felt that a student
vote would be based strictly on
popularity.

The committee who selected
the winner consisted of men

Oakland Tweed Shop, "the
WQED art staff, and Irv Roth-
man, Student Publications di-

Commenting on Mis" Eggers’ in-
eligibility, which was announced
after she was declared the Uni-
versity candidate, Zacharies said
the committee “was never told be-
fore hand of any qualiﬁcations.”

Adams Explains

“Evidently there is a policy con-
cerning students representing the
University in outside contests.”

Bernard Adams, special as— .
sistant to the Chancellor, ex-
plained why the ‘University
hadn’t notiﬁed the SG public re-
lations of its policy concerning
contests. L

“Like so many other things, you
don’t think of it until its too late.

  Honoroble Plan I

Initiation of the freshman honors program is another

step up the academic ladder on this campus.

, As the pieces begin to fall together in the University’s
master plan for a first—rate education, the beneﬁts available

V A to incoming freshmen are becoming more and more im-

pressive.

V + . _ For the student who will take advantage of the situa-

tion, such as the honors program, the sound and thorough

education so sought after by every college student can be-
come a reality. The real emphasis is on the student" himself

and his own initiative.

 >  ‘i Seminars and ‘papers can provide the incentive, the out-
V come depends on the student’s willingness to _work and to
learn. He will have the opportunity to advance independ-,

ently of a bulky class. By beginning the program in the
freshman year, the student will also be able todiscipline.
his mind before outside distractions can detract him’.

petitions and Monday for party slates and individual peti-

tions. Again wevremind everyone concerned that SG will

never be effective unless it has student backing.

/‘Five hundred students voted aﬁirmatively 7for the

I-Reaves-Slotkin plan. So far only two of those 500 have

bothered to apply fora petition for ofﬁce with no assur-

ance that those petitions will be returned. V

To regain the respect it once had, SG cannot quit its
ﬁght in mid—stream. The groundwork has been laid, now

 someone mus make the plan work. The Monday deadline

must be met.

The Blessed Land

 

At the end of World War II, there suddenly ap-
peared in the world a new phenomenon: the Amer-
icans. They showed up in the Atlantic, in Berlin, in
the Middle East. The occupied the Paciﬁc, Japan,
Korea, and, of course, they “defended” the whole
of Southeast Asia. I ‘need not ‘
mention Latin America since it
has always been known as their
own backyard.

Everywhere they are being
talked about. Newspapers of all _
dialects describe their actions, .
while their slang is absorbed by I:
other national languages. The
‘omnipresence of the Americans I
is a phenomenon ‘of the 20th _
Century. Everyone has heard of 5
A m e r i c a n supersalesmanship, A"
the American way of life, the American dream, etc.
Since America’s image has been associated with
size, speed, efficiency and ﬁashiness, I have called
the American the 20th Century Man and America,
the Blessed Island. -

Since coming tothe U.S., I have had opportuni-
ties to observe the Americans. The best placeito ob-
serve, I thought, was New‘ York City. One day I
found myself standing on 42nd Street observing the
20th Century Man.

Women Wear Warpaint ,

I confess that I was disappointed because there

were so many of them. What?s more, there was

I nothing specialin his attire; his look and manners

did not betray any subtle difference. The women,
of course, wore their skirts too short and their heels
made an awful noise on the sidewalks. Frequently,
their faces reminded me of Indian warpaint. Of
course, this is America where industries provide
them with cosmetics in quantity. I need only to
- remind myself that in this country the constitu-
tion gives them the right to be the boss, both in
the oﬂice and at the home. Coming back to the
20th Century Man, he was walking very fast and
obviously looking for something. Money, somebody
told me——that was the word! .
When I left New York’ to explore the interior,
I found that the picture of the 20th Century Man
I gathered in New York wasn’t the only one. Here,
the people are less worried about money. In fact
they are moregoptimistic about everything. I saw
only happy people whose picture tubes brought the
world to their living rooms. At 6 p.m., the news; at
7 p.m., Huckleberryil-Iound; at 8 p.m., Wells Fargo;
at 9 p.m., Peter Gunn;.at 10 p.rn\., wrestling with

 

By Long Thoumany

,Bobo Brasil; and then the late show at 11 pm. on

Sundays, it’s off to church to wash away the sins
of the week. After church, dinner is ready; a, hot},
juicy steak and an apple pie with ice cream on top,
It is fast to cook because everything in the kitchen
is automatic and grocery stores provide frozen
foods. ,7 ,_

One mus_t say that automation is very» helpful

since no one has to work very hard and everyone,

has plenty of leisure time. A minor inconvenience
is that one is bound to get fat without evercise,

However, in this happy land every problem has!‘

a solution. Tons of liquid Metrecal have been pro-

duced to keep the Americans trim and youthful. “

But if a news story, telling about low prestige

abroad, should cause a headache or stomach up-“V

set, there is always fast Bufferin and faster Anacin
to do the trick.
Optimism is Basic I

Optimism is not a malady. It is the basic ingre-. , I

dient of a “nice democratic way of life.” Mr. Sue-

cess, the American, will drive a compact or king- A
size car, depending on the mood of the produc-

tion men at General Motors. He will join the
“American Society of. Optimists.” He will abhor
violence and believe in “instant progress,” i.e.
progress without change. , A _
The Americans are, after all, a free people.
Their founding fathers said that each should be
permitted to pursue a happy way of ' life in his
own way. Parents, therefore, encourage their col-
lege-age sons and daughters to “have a good time,”
Making good grades as well is incidental,.since
everyone knows colleges are social institutions.

Still the future is uncertain. At the other side‘,

of the world, Mr-. Khrushchev, tired of his rocket
rattling, exploded his 50-megaton (by mistake, so
he said) to celebrate the October Revolution and
to s'a1ute the onset of a new era: the era of always-
winning communism. He is quite convinced of the
ﬁnal score: he will bury everyone (and probably
himself). Yet, with the H-bomb hanging ‘over ev-
erybody’s headwthe American “fun-loving millions”
still“ consider the chance that it might not explode-—
the trigger may fail. They know, as well, that the
shelter program is making headway and have faith
that the Strategic Air Command will intercept any
“villain Russian intruders.” ..

And so, Sunday afternoon, they go to the Sym-
phony while WYRT plays some melodies on the
air, everywhere over Pittsburgh.

GOD bless optimists! GOD bless the United
States of Amarim. the land of no worry.

tempting to prove; then he claims
that “Peace ‘ comes not from

marching, but through the moral

and physical courage that Amer-

Now, if we pluck Mr. Van Riper

out from behind his waving flag,

I think we will be able to see that

there is both moral and physical

courage in the plan for the Wash-
ington demonstration.

Also, they are not trying to
“bully” and bluff America ‘into
giving up the use of force to stop

ing to show that they believe that

out needlessly endangering the

Van Riper Letter

Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to compliment Mr.
Van Riper on his excellent letter
regarding the “peace march” to
Washington. I believe that a show
of unilateral disarmament would
tragically weaken America's na-
tional posture and its will to de-
fend its own freedom and that of
the free world.

gOne really can’t expect that
after forty years of dishonor in
abiding with international agree-
ments, that Russia would agree
to disarm for humanitarian rea-
sons. World 'Peace and abolish-
ment of the bomb are noble senti-
ments, but it is to be doubted that
thiswould be achieved by throw-
ing down our arms and trusting to
Russia’s humanitarian conscience
to do the same. This would be
a travesty to the memory of those
who have sacriﬁced their lives

Dr. Grace Lazovik Seeks
New Research in Psychology

BY JOSEY GROSSMAN w
Dr. Grace F. Lazovik, n.ewly appointed director of the
University Testing Service, approves of the present system
of psychological testing but plans to broaden the Service’s

,4:

research function.

“The Service has beendoing much research, and I’d
like to see it do more by branching out into broader areas.”

Dr. Lazovik hopes to continue¢

the Testing Service’s present in-
vestigation of motivational meas-
ures in academic success. “There
are already measures of ability
and performance, but at the mo-
ment there is no measure of aca-
demic motivation,” thevnew direc-
tor commented.
To Follow up Research

“I would l:ike to see the Testing

Service expand like the programs

‘on the-. west coast, particularly in

California a ‘n d .Washington.
They’re doing considerably more
investigation there than in most
of the eastern states. Eventually,

,I’d like to follow upsome of the

research they're been doing on the
Coast for a more complete. pre-
dictability of
graded areas."

Dr. Lazovik came to the
-- University after spending ten
years at ' the University of

Washington in Seattle as direc-
tor of the Office of Teaching
Evaluation. In 1957, she became
associated with the University
of Pittsburgh School of Health
Professions and later with the
Office of Educational Research.
The OER has developed into the
Office of Institutional Planning.

She ‘began teaching psychology
full time in 1959 in the glraduate
courses in psychological tests and
measurements and in statistics
and experimental design.

Dr. Lazovik received her Ph.D.
at the University of Washington
with her special area in psycho-
logical measurement. There she
studied under Dr. Paul Horst, one
of the fdrernost’ psychologists in
this area. She also majored in
psychology inher undergraduate
work at the University of Mary-
land.

Four weeks of experimental
language instruction by means of
teaching machines may prove an
important step in teaching deaf
children to express themselves in
written language.

The experiment was conceived
by Dr. Jack Birch, head of the De-
partment of Special Education and
Rehabilitation at the University,
and by E. Ross Stuckless, a former
teacher of deaf children now do-
ing research at the University.

The teaching machines are at-
tempting to teach the children
how to construct simple sentences.
The lessons involve seven verbs in
four tenses, 31 nouns used vari-
ously, and four adjectives which
will be used after the verb “to
be” and in comparisons.

Made of Fiber

-The machines are made of fiber
board and have two windows, one
exposing the question, the other
providing space for the student to
write his answer. .

As the knob on the machin
is turned,nrolling each question
into place. the student sees a
picture and clues that indicate
the parts of speech and verb
tense called for. His answer
should consist of a complete

sentence expressing the idea
suggested, for example “The
horse ran."

There are two special advan-
tages of the machine; each child
can go at the rate most advan-
tageouslfor him, and he can im-
mediately compare his answer to
the correct one shown on another
part of the machine.

Ends Tomorrow

The experiment ends tomorrow
for 25 students and their teachers
at the Pennsylvania School for
the Deaf, in Mt. Airy, and the
W. & E. Martin School for the
Hearing Handicapped, at 22nd and
Brown Streets in Philadelphia.

At the end of the experiment
the class will be tested for re-
tention of information. How
well the control group in the ex-
periment have learned to con-
struct the simple sentence will _
provide evidence of whether
machines can effectively take
over mechanical aspects of lan-
guage instruction.

Originators oi' the experiment
believe it may have long range
signiﬁcance. but according to

Stuckless, ‘fmachines can never
substitute for teachers because

3 Organizations Seek
Campus Recognition

By BARRY GROSS
Three student organizations are not yet recognized offi-

cially by the University.

To receive University permission to hold meetings on
campus, a student organization has to petition either Student
Government or the Subcommittee of the Student Affairs
Committee, depending upon the organization’s purpose.

The newly forming
process of petitioning for recog-
nition by the Student Affairs Com-
mittee.

Committee Recessed

But the committee is inactive at
the moment. Because of the ab-
sence of an organized committee,
two organizations have been
functioning on campus without of-
ﬁcial recognition.

According to the 1961-1962
Roste! of Student Organizations
on campus, neither the Inquiry
Club nor the Society for Con-
servative Studies have been
recognized by SG or the com-
mittee.

Philir Davis, one of the t'o'md-
ers of the Marxist Discussion
chronicled the events
which led to temporary permis-
sion for the group to meet until
their petition is considered.

Submits Constitution

Davis submitted the group's
constitution to Martha Hyslop of
the Student Affairs Committee
and she passed it on to N. Ron-
ald Pease, Assistant Dean of Men.

Pease sent the constitution
over to Alan C. Rankin, assist-
ant chancellor of Student and
General Affairs. Rankin said he

was going to review the com- .

mittee. He sent a letter to the
club’s founders.

“Pending organizational approv-
al by the Student Affairs Coin-
mittee, the Marxist Discussion
Group is authorized to hold a
meeting on campus Thursday,
February 15 at 7:30 p.m.

“This is not a precedent for fu-
ture meetings.”

Holds Meeting
.January 18 the club held an
organizational meeting. About 30
students attended.

According to a policy state-
ment issued by the Student Af-
fairs Committee in 1958, student
organizations which are “ex-
tensions of curricular or depart-
mental programs of the Univer-
sity . . ., professipnal, recogni-
tion, and honorary organizations
related to academic and profes-
sional ﬁelds within the Univer-

Marxist‘
-Discussion Group is now in the

»'dl’l

sity . . ., and departmentally or
interdepartmentally sponsored
faculty - student discussion
groups  .” must petition the

committee for recognition.

Other organizations are to pre-
sent their petitions directly to
Student Government.

Dr. Rankin explained that the
committee can approve or accept
organization’s petition, but
that he can reverse their deci-
sion.

Professors Sponsor

Professors Arthur Tuden of the
Anthropology Department and
R. L. Richman of the Economics
Department are co-sponsors of the
group.

“Something encompassing

such a wide part of the world's
population should be studied,”
Professor Tuden said. “This
particular orientation has been
neglected although newspapers
are always referring to Marx
and Marxism.”
’ “A critical evaluation is need-
ed,” Tuden continued, “and some
universities have a special cur-
riculum for the study of Marx-
ism. Wesleyan brought in an ex-
pert in 1950 to explain Marxism
and Michigan State now has a
course on it.”

Tuden said that the group
would conduct “an academic and
objective analysis” of Marxism.
“Faculty members competent in
their fields will lead discussions,”
he said.

Last Thursday C‘arl Weiner of
the History Department spoke on
“The Concept of Culti re on
Marx” at the group’s ﬁrst formal
meeting.

Wrestlers .Meet Penn State In
Season Finale At ‘ield House

Eastern Champion
lion Pifer to Face
Daryl Kelvington
By BOB SMIZIK '
There will be no time for
remorse this week for the
Panther wrestlers. As disap-
pointing as the loss to Lehigh 
might have been, the grap- '-

plers must be on their toes
this Saturday when they host
Penn State at the Field House at
9 p.m.

This year the Lions do not have
as powerful a squad as usual, but
they have the individuals nec-
essary to give anyone a rough
time. ‘

One of these individuals is Ron
Pifer, detending Eastern cham-
pion and national runner-up at ,
147 pounds. If the expected ’  .
match between Pifer and Daryl
Kelvington comes. off it should be
well worth the 1 rice of admission

I believe that it was Chet Smith who said, “the readers
always write:

A gent who calls himself simply “A Fanatic Fan,” writes:

- “Wrestling has now established itself as the No. 2 sport
at Pitt. The Lehigh meet convinced meet? this. 3,800 fans

came to see the grapplers in action, and they really cheered
when the teams jogged onto the court. Streamers were ﬂying, and
the crowd was enthusiastic throughout the evening, bursting into
applause when a Pitt man would score a point.

“The students turned out to the hilt, 1,300 of them, and the
basketball team never drew such a turnout this year. I think the
students respect Coach Peery and his team because the other teams
respectlthem as well. But tell m_e really what’s wrong with the
 basketball teain?”  .. "

Owls Here Tonight;

PS Visited Saturday

By ART FLEISCHNER

Some of the early season

optimism about the Pitt bas-

ketball team seemsto have worn off both fans and players

alike. A pre-season statement

from a player concerning the

team’s chances was, “I can’t predictour exact record, but I
know it will be better than last year’s.”

Facing the situation realis

tically, this seems highly un-

likely. Tonight the Panthers muste
face a rugged Temple quintet and
on Saturday travel to College
Park to play a team that has al-
ready defeated them this year,
74-62 at the Field House.

Pitt will be up against one of
its most formidable opponents
when they entertain the Temple
Owls. Temple’s record reads 14-
6. Included in this are two wins
garnered in winning the Hurri-
cane Classic at Miami, Florida
during the Christmas vacation.

Litwack Best

Coach Harry Litwack, who is
call.ed by many, “The best coach
in the state,” needs a victory to-
night if his team is to make the
NIT tournament.

Litwack brings a senior-dom-
inated squad to the Field House
seeking revenge. for last year’s_
loss tc Pitt in overtime, 80-75,
at Philadelphia.

The Owls are led by All-Amer-

The diminutive senior has led
Temple for three seasons and is
another one of the ﬁne basketball
players that Pittsburgh fans have
had the opportunity to watch this
year.
' , Lost Earlier

The Panthers will close out
what has been a less than success-
ful season as they hope to reverse

State. Pitt hasn’t beaten the Nit-
tany Lions at State since the 1957-
1958 season and. trail in the life-
time series 52-46.

 

TWO VETERANS who hope to
salvage some lost glory in the
ﬁnal two games are Ben Jinks,
right, and Tom Maloney. Both
men were starters last year on
the basketball team but both

have fallen aside to the sopho-
more inﬂux. I

*'k*

Coach John Egli who said the
last time he visited Pittsburgh,
“I really didn’t think we would
beat Pitt,” should go into Satur-
day’s game with a different atti-
tude. His team will be seeking
their twelfth win of the year
against nine defeats.

Coach Bob Timmons will again
have to ﬁgure out how Ito stop
Schenley High graduate Gene
Harris, who is averaging better
than 20 points a game. However,
if the Panthers show some of the
optimism they displayed earlier
this year, they may be able to
end the season on a successful
note.

Pleased Here

MIAMI, Ohio—Lavern Benson,
the cat-quick guard of the Red-
skins basketball team, was still
smiling about his electrifying ex-
hibition against Pitt’s basketball
team last week.

“I was quite

a reporter dur-

“Every team

“Maybe they
were hoping to

guard or something, but I sure

happy with the results.”
Benson scored 31 points that
night, 21 in the first half as the
Redskins won only their sixth
game in 19 outings at the Field
House. V

“Somebody even told me,” Ben-
son continued, “that it says in our
program that any team that tries
(‘to go with me man-for-man is
asking for trouble. I don’t want
to sound egotistical, but they
sure played my kind of game.

Coach In Dark
About Kent State

This coming Saturday the Pitt

Frosh basketball team plays at \

Kent State. Coach Peterson knows
nothing about the current edition
of Kent State and is going for the
most part on what they have done
in the past.

In talking about State, Peterson
had this to say, “Kent State is
an odd college in that it is easy
to get into but academically it is
hard to stay. They» usually have
a ﬁne freshman team but many
of the boys aren’t around long
enough to help the varsity.”

Coach Peterson said about his
own team: “For a change we
played as a unit instead of in-
dividually. If this trend keeps up
and Tom Roantree and Daryl
Ruby play the kind of ball they
have lately, it should be a good
game.”

Ohio U. Swimmers

Visit Here This Week I

After patrolling enemy waters the past two weeks, the Panther
swimmers will return to their home port this ‘weekend. The Cats

will be seeking their seventh win

of the season when they host the

Ohio University team at the Carnegie Tech pool on Saturday night.

The meet begins at 8 p.m.

Last year the Ohio squad hand-
ed the Panthers a 56-39 set-back,
and are expected to prove equal-
1y as tough this time. Neverthe-
less, the Panthers will not fall
over and play dead, as they need
a victory on Saturday to get back
on the winning track after their
recent defeat at North Carolina
State.

In spite of last Saturday’s loss
the Panthers have been steadily
improving, just as Pitt swim-
ming coach Ben Grady thought
they would.
hard in practice, and as the sea-
son progresses this hard work
should pay off in improved per-
formances,” ‘commented the
coach earlier this year.

Thus far, Coach Grady’s pre-
dictions have proved true as the
Panther tankmen have been
breaking records all season. In
nine meets the Cats have better-
ed twelve University marks and
many more pool records. '

Leading this onslaught against
the record books have been the
Levine twins, Rob and Ron, Steve

“The boys work » ‘E

«A
V

Ganong, and Dennis McHugh. All
of these boys are only sopho-
mores, which will provide them
with two more years to try to
lower their own marks.

The Panthers will go into Sat-
urday’s meet sporting a 6-3 sea-
son record. ‘

Gymnast Proves Versatile

By SANDY RESNICK
Making. Ed Zamecnik talk about himself is almost as
futile as unmasking the Lone Ranger. It is not that the
blond gymnast is shy or backward, but Ed is mature and
modest. At the age of 22, this junior provides for a wife and

two daughters.

At Binghamton North High in New York, Ed lettered
in football and baseball and was0“"o‘""'“*"“"'"'““*'“““""*“‘”"“""“'“‘*“o*"""“*‘“" 

selected for a 24 man All-State
baseball squad. Zamecnik also
tried his hand at basketball but
quit the team in his sophomore
year to participate in gymnastics
at a local Slovak Gymnastic Un-
ion, known as Sokol.

“Gymnastics is a cultured
sport,” claims Ed. “Unlike other
sports, the fans must» be quiet
when the gymnast performs.”
Aside from gymnastic culture, Ed
enjoys reading novels and listen--
ing to semi—classical and classical
music. . l

Coat Hoax

Only one slight superstition en-—
tered Ed’s cultured world. The
gymnast has noticed that the team
invariably loses when he wears
a sport coat to a. meet. If this
hoax holds true, there may be a
day when Pitt gyiv  will be
forbidden to wear s;-:2. . coats dur-
ing the season.

.. SALES MANAGEMENT?

At P&G, it is not unusual for men in their late twenties and early thirties to
reach a level of management where they are responsible for a sales force of
several management people and 12 to 18 salesmen, and an annual volume of
business close to $15 million. a

Real career opportunities await good men in sales management at
Procter 8: Gamble.

Selling is a vital. function with us, and men capable of creative and
ingenious solutions to sales problems will ﬁnd it a short route to
top management.

All of the sales -management executives in our company started
in exactly the same positions open to you upon graduation.

At P&G, promotions are always from within, strictly on the basis of
performance, and in no other company will you ﬁnd such unlimited
opportunity for advancement on the basis of merit alone.

Procter 8: Gamble has doubled its sales volume on the average of
every ten years since 1900. As Fortune magazine points out, “P&G
products are found in 95 out of eyery 100 homes . . . a penetration
unequaled by‘ any other manufacturer of anything.”

For ten consecutive years, the American Institute of Management
has named P&G to the select group of “best managed" companies
in America.

That’s a pretty good track record. It should mean something to you.
