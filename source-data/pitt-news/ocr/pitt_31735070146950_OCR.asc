Forbes and Fifth among new emergency routes

Philip Bombara
For The Pitt News

The temperature is dropping and
snowﬂakes accumulating, but stu-

dents shouldn’t expect a repeat
performance of last Februa1'y’s
“Snowpocalypse,” the record-
breaking snowstorm that all but
halted traffic in Oakland.

Forbes and Fifth avenues are

two of the snow emergency routes

the city is implementing, meaning .

these streets will be some of the

ﬁrst in Pittsburgh to be cleared.
Emergency signs, which read

“Emergency Snow Route” and have

a picture of a snow ﬂake, have al-
ready started appearing on the
streets.

Rob Kaczorowski, the city’s
Publicworks Director, called the

chosen emergency routes the “ma—

jor arteries” of the city. When in-
clement weather necessitates road
clearing, these emergency routes

will receive priority.

‘Canorah’ built for holiday, charity

Katherine Sandler
Staﬁ’Wrifer

Menorahs aren’t usually associated with
large cans of chick peas, beans and tomato
sauce. However, the newest holiday addition
in the William Pitt Union lobby is comprised
completely of these industrial—sized food
cans. .
This unique menorah was lit during a
ceremony last night. Although it will not
be lighted every evening, the menorah will
remain in the lobby until Dec. 9 —— the end
of Hanukkah. .
Jewish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi col—
laborated with the Chabad House — ajewish
student organization at Pitt — to organize
the Canorah event, a service project that

will donate the canned food to the Squirrel ’

Hill Food Pantry.
Shoshana Hoexter, program director

of the Chabad House, opened the event_
by explaining to about 50 people that the
Canorah being lit will “light up lives” of the
less fortunate. .

“This project has been in the works since
the end of the last school year,” said Mi-
chael Cohan, Pitt sophomore and chair of
the Canorah event. “Many Alpha Epsilon Pi
fraternities are doing this across the country.
It is a great opportunity for recognition and
to do something for the community.”

Stewart Sutin, clinical professor within
Pitt’s department of Administrative and
Policy Studies, was invited to light the me-
norah. -

He said that he and his wife are parental
of Chabad on campus and have associated
with the organization for years.

Senior members of the fraternity chal-
lenged this year’s pledge class to raise be-
tween $1,000 and $1,500. Once the pledges

books for Pittsburghers during the holi-
day season.

He added that Bring on the Books pro-
vides a way for students to get involved in
charitable outreach without the worry of
ﬁnancial woes or monetary donations.

“College students aren’t as rich as oth-
ers in society  but just because we don’t
have money to contribute, we can still
contribute what we’ve had in the past,”
Sizar said.

The donated books will be distributed
between UPMC children’s health clinics
and the children’s playrooms in the Pitts-
burgh courts, a free daycare center for
parents who have court business.

Books for those younger than 7 will be
donated primarily to the health clinics
in lower—income neighborhoods whereas
those for ages 7 through 15 will go to the
children’s playrooms.

The books are separated by age because
one of Sizar’s partners works primarily
with children younger than 7.

The Reach Out and Read Foundation, -

which promotes early childhood literacy
and school readiness, will take the books
from Sizar’s drive and place them in health
clinics throughout Pittsburgh.

ing that the children involved will haveat
least 10 books by the time they start kin-
dergarten, said Matt Ferraguto, director
of communications at Reach Out and Read.
He said the program helps children boost
their reading level by up to six months.

“Rich, poor, black, white — 96 percent
of children go to their pediatrician every
year, so if we can work through them to
promote school readiness we will have a
lot more success,” Ferraguto said.

Bring on the Books’ work with the chil—
dren’s playrooms in the courts will-include

Ellen Siegel, director of the Children’s
Rooms in the courts, said that every time
a child visits the playroom, they will leave
with a book —— no matter how many times
they come. ,

Because of the high volume of chil-
dren that visit the courts —— about 5,000
children visit the rooms each year — the
playrooms’ workers often ﬁnd themselves
in need of a large number of books.

Siegel said the largest shortage is in
board books, books designed for toddlers
that are made of cardboard rather than
paper. I

service. _

Although the city is working to avoid a
repeat performance, Pitt will continue with
last year’s snow-removal methods.

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said Pitt will
not be changing its snow response practices
in any way from last year. Despite the com-
plications raised by the record-breaking
snowfall of last year, he said the University
feels conﬁdent in its facilities crew’s ability
to keep on top of the weather. P

“The difficulties in removing the snow '

last year were related to the magnitude of
the storms and the city’s inability to clear
streets and remove snow. Pitt sidewalks and
privately owned streets were immediately
cleared and remained so throughout the
snow period. It was city—owned or main-
tained streets and sidewalks that were a
problem,” Fedele said.

Pitt student Brian White is not convinced
that only city streets were an issue last win-

" ter.

' a problem. For me to make it from my dorm

in Lothrop to Market Central in Towers, I
should not have to worry about uncleared
sidewalks. Yes, the patio of Lothrop was
cleared, and so was Towers patio, but it is

getting from one to the other that presents

the issue,f’ he said.

After many problems, both in Oakland
and other areas of the city, the Public'Works
Department was under pressure to reform.
One of the biggest changes in line for this
year is a list of pre—qualiﬁed and approved
contractors to assist with snow removal.

Because the majority of streets in Pitts-
burgh have on—street parking, large plows
are unable to clear all the streets. Instead,
the ‘haul-and—remo,Val method must be
used. Only City Public Works employees
are allowed to salt and plow the streetsjbut
private contractors are allowed to assist in

' . snow removal.

The city had to hire contractors on an
emergency basis last year to help get the
city up and running. This year’s addition
of a pre—qualiﬁed list will help cut down on
response time as well as offer a more deﬁ-
nite course of action in a snow emergency,
Kaczorowski said. ,
l According to Kaczorowski, the changes
will help cut down on response time in gen-
eral and, under normal circumstances, the
goal is to have the city’s roads cleared within

' 24 hours.

He also said that there' is a ﬂier being
mailed out to- all -residents, which offers an
overview of the new plan for this year as well
as other pertinent information regarding
winter preparedness. I ‘

Revive American swagger

Come on people, it’s OK to ignore Teddy Roosevelt

 
 
  

‘Jacob Brown
Columnist

After last week’s food-induced coma
and action-movie marathon that be-
ganwith the cult classic “Shogun As-
sassin,’_’ my oldest brother went on
a rant concerning perhaps the most
controversial topic facing the United
States: the BCS college football poll.

No offense to our government or
the TSA, but far more controversy
lies in ranking our nation’s college
football teams.

Even though the Pittfootball team
has once again found a way to make
a $25 season ticket worthless, there’s
still plenty of reason to mention the
BCS. '

My brother graduated from a
university whose president recently
made some remarks concerning non-
conference teams gainingaberth into
the National Championship Game. In
his interview, Ohio State’s president,

_ Gordon Gee, said that schools like

Texas Christian University and Boise
State shouldn’t play in title games be-
cause of their weaker schedules, ac-
cording to The Chicago Sun-Times.

The same could "be said for any
football team in the Big East, but
that’s not the point of this column.
Nor is it my point to talk too much
about sports. Leave that to the guys
a few pages from here.

Gee’s comments have sparked a
litany of responses from people who
have said his remarks were inappro-
priate. But perhaps those offended
should reﬂect on the situation with
a wider perspective. V

Gee did nothing wrong. He de-
fended the rigors of the Big Ten Con-
ference and took onus for the fact
that he believes in his university’s
strength as one of the best — as any
university head should in a similar
situation.

Though I’m a believer in Teddy
Roosevelt’s “Speak softly and carry’ a
big stick’ philosophy, Gee illustrated
the proper occasion to ignore it. Call
it smacktalk, boasting or just good 01’

fashioned ﬁghtin’ words, it’s a neces-
sary part of our culture. And there
needs to be more of it.

We’ve become asociety of wusses,
pansies and paciﬁsts. There’s nothing
wrong with turning the other cheek

, when the situation calls for it, but we

do it too routinely. Then again, we’re
trained to.

The wussiﬁcation of America has
spread substantially in recent times.
I blame much of it on the notion of
socializing outcomes, of telling ev-
eryone that they are special. It’s why
colleges and universities around the
country have become degree facto-
ries, diluting the value of upper-tier
institutions.

It’s why welfare programs are no
longer frowned upon in the same
light as they were decades ago. And
it’s why we have institutions that give
people titles like “senior executive
vice president” instead of something
you or I would understand.

We’re afraid of making people feel
unspecial.

Bring babies into schools to reduce bullying

Katie Azzara
Columnist

My friends and I were recently
reminiscing about some past
school‘ experiences, and in-
evitably, the topic of bullying
came up. We each had stories to
tell + both about being bullied
ourselves and about others who
were picked on in school.

Some examples, such as one
about a group of boys who were
bullied to the point of plotting
against other students, were
more_dramatic than others, but
the fact remained constant --

'bullying, in one way or another,

plays a big role in the lives of
young people. ‘

I hate the thought of bullying. ‘

It brings_back memories of being
teased on the elementary school
playground andmean girls in the
high school locker room. It’s a
big problem in our society, and
unfortunately, it’s a problem
with which far too many people
are familiar.

Most people have experience

‘with at least one side of bully-‘

ing, and some probably have ex-
periences on both. Many of us
have, for one reason or another,
picked on someone else, espe-
cially in early adolescence, when
it seemed that nothing was as
important as ﬁtting iniwith the

coolcrowd andrejecting those _
who weren’t considered cool. a‘

And if you haven’t been a bully,
you’ve more than likely been the

_ subject of bullying.

Although some might believe
that bullying is a phase that peo-
ple grow out of, evidence has now

arisen that it continues well into-

adulthood. For. example, the case
of Tyler Clementi, the Rutgers

-_ student who was allegedlyﬁlmed ‘: ‘
“during private iriteractions'in his _
dormitory, has captivated the ,

media. His subsequent suicide

shows how truly devastating the '

effects of bullying can be.
More and more, we are be-
ginning to see examples of this
type of bullying, which can be
contrasted with -more traditional
forms, such as teasing and mean
comments in school hallways.
Cyber—bullying has become a
common way for people to put
others down, often anonymously

and in public forums. It seems
that now more than ever, it is
important to reject the idea that
bullying is a fact of life and to
be proactive about preventing
the problem. A current study
suggests this mightjust be pos-
sible. A recent“New York Times

among schoolchildren by raising
social/emotional competence’
and increasing empathy.” Their
intention is to nip bullying in the
bud at a young age in order to
promote a more civil society.
Though we can’t know the
long—term effects of this pro-

Personally, I’ve always been
a strong believer in baby '

therapy.

‘article describes a program that

attempts to use humans""innate
*tende«ncy toward compassion to
combat bullying. A

The study involves a Canada-

based program known as Roots '

of Empathy, in which a mother
and baby make several visits to
elementary and middle school
classrooms and interact with
the students, attempting to get
them to understand the feelings
of the baby.

According to its website,
Roots of Empathy works to
decrease “levels of aggression

gram on children’s tendencies
toward bullying, it seems that
the presence of the mother and
baby have precipitated positive
changes within the classroom.

Personally, I’ve always been a
strong believer in baby therapy.
I really have no trouble believ-
ing that this program is bring-
ing about better school environ-
ments. ‘

The question, however, is
whether or not . the positive
changes seen in school children
will continue throughout life.
Clearly, the conditions that lead

a person to bully cannot be com-
pletely addressed simply by the
presence of a baby. The more we
‘understand why people bully,
the closer we can get to putting
an end to it. '

Though bullying can stem
from everything from jealousy
to plain old dislike, it’s primarily
a power struggle. Putting oth-

ers down unfortunately causes-

bullies to feel powerful. The
interesting thing is that if you
think about it, the people who
are most often bullied —- those
who have some sort of eccen-
tricity and just aren’t quite like
other people — actually end up
being some ofthe most interest-

ing and successful people iii the
long run.

Unfortunately, bullying is
often taken too far and can re-
sult in shattered confidence,
or something even worse. Pro-
grams such as Roots of Empa-
thy, however, are a step in the
right direction toward ending
a problem that has gone on for
far too long.

Pitt songbirds croon about winter season

Campus choral groups are preparing for their winter concerts that will feature a variety of songs, from classical to pop

Heinz’ Chapel Choir
Today 5:15 p.m.
Heinz Chapel
Admission: free

Though their other concerts are
sold out, the Heinz Chapel Choir
will perform one free concert on
Pitt’s campus today.

The choir formed in 1938 as 

part of the religious services in
Heinz Chapel. It became a Univer-
sity concert choir in the 1950s,
which meant that rather than just
singing religious songs, the choir
began to perform pieces from al-
most every genre, saidjohn Gold-
smith, the choir director.

Songs this year include “Santa
Claus Is Back In Town” and “When
You Believe,” a song from the mov-
ie “The Prince of Egypt.”

Junior Sarah Ivins joined the
choir as a freshman when she audi-
tioned for one of 12 seats available

e at the time._ A singer since a young

age, it was important to her to re-
main active in a musical group. The
upcoming Christmas concerts are
Ivins’ favorite choir events. ~
“Performing in the Heinz Cha-

pel provides fantastic acoustics
and a beautiful setting in which
to sing,” she said. “The Holiday
Concert tradition is to begin the
concert in the balcony, with more
traditional choral pieces. Then we
move down to the ﬂoor and sur-
round the audience with lanterns,
singing as the lights outside the
Chapel are turned on, illuminat-
ing the brilliant stained glass win-
dows.”

The choir also performs four
other concerts in addition to the
free performance, but don’t look
for tickets to those events — they
sold out early.

e“We always have a full house,
even off campus,” Goldsmith said.
“The reputation has been spread-
ing for a long time now. When peo-
ple come once, they come back

‘ because they enjoy it so much.

Tickets are on sale in October and
they’re gone [in three weeks] be-
cause this is a family tradition and
people won’tmiss the Christmas
concerts.”

For ABC Family, Christmas comes
early every year — 25 days early,
to be exact. For viewers, how-
ever, the holiday cheer wore off
ages ago.

Though not as beloved a rit-
ual as, say, decorating the tree
or making cookies, ABC Family
presents its “25 Days of Christ-
mas” as an integral part of the
holiday experience. The network
would have you believe missing
its hallowed countdown would
be akin to forgetting to buy your
grandmother a present. '

Unfortunately,-there are only
so many times you can watch
“The Santa Clause” before its
charm begins to sour. And while
ABC’s much—advertised original
program — “The Dog Who Saved
Christmas Vacation,” starring
Paris Hilton — is doubtlessly
destined for unprecedented
critical acclaim, there are other
holiday movies that more effec-
tively employ themes of redemp-
tion —— albeit without a hilarious
talking poodle.

Below I present four alterna-
tive films to cap off your Christ-
mas countdown —- proof that
holiday movies aren’t all feel-

good ﬂuff, and assurance that I
will never become an executive at
a major television network.

For ABC Family viewers ,

however, the

that morph into malicious de-
mons afterbeing fed past mid-
night — and, most of all, lots

oliday cheer

Wore off ages ago.

“Gremlins” (1984):joe Dante’s
black comedy has all the ingredi-
ents of a cult classic: cheeseball
characters, an absurd setup -
adorable, Furby—esque creatures

and lots of memorable violence.
One famous scene involves both
a blender and a microwave.

The genius of “Gremlins” is
not just that it made Christmas

alternative Christmas cinema

into a gore—fest — that same year,
“Silent Night, Deadly Night” en-
sured that nothing in cinema was
sacred — but that it offered an al-
ternative “classic” to which more
cynical families could turn come
the holidays. “Gremlins,” like “A
Christmas Story” or the animated
“Grinch,” has near—infinite re-
play value — for those who can
stomach it. «

“Millions” (2004): On a cheer-
ier note, Danny Boyle’s (“127
Hours,” “Slumdog Millionaire”)
underrated “Millions” is the per-
fect ﬁlm to counterbalance vi-
s_ions of gremlins running a man
down with a snowplow.

ALBUM REVIEW

Groban gives goosebumps

Illuminations

A- .

Rocks Like: A classical Five For Fight-
ing

Classical and pop music meet in Illumina-
tions, the new release of American singer-
songwriterjosh Groban.

The artist is now well—established, hav-
ing released four previous albums and made
two guest appearances on “Glee.”

Similar to previous releases, Groban’s
music primarily features an orchestra with
piano and string instrument solos. Some
songs are in other languages, including Ital-
ian and Portuguese. In these cases, Groban
relies on the instrumental music and power
of his vocals to convey meaning to those
who do not speak the languages.

On this latest album, Groban leans a little
away from his previous works by diversi-
fying his sound. Though Groban fans will
surely recognize the artist’s work, some
tracks feature stronger drums and guitars,
as well as a pop-quality tempo.

The lyrics, however, remain pretty simi-

T is one album worth looking into. Groban

prefers songs that carry a hopeful quality
to them. This is a trend his single “Hidden
Away” continues with lyrics like, “And all
these words you were meant to say / Held’
in silence day after day / Words of kindness
that our poor hearts crave / Please don’t
keep them / Hidden Away.” ‘ 4

It’s fair to say that Groban’s sound and
his lyrics might not be for everyone, but this

considers Illuminations a “live” album,
only doing one take on most of his songs.
Groban breathes life into the classical style,
and his powerful voice leaves listenersﬂwith

Admission: free with Pitt ID
Proartstickets.org

With multiple languages, 60 members
and various styles of music, this year’s An-
nual Holiday Concert performed by the Pitt
Men’s Glee Club offers a broad selection of
holiday music .

This Friday at the First Baptist Church,
the 121—year—old Pitt Men’s Glee Club will
sing its multicultural songs.

“You’ve got a mostly a cappella concert

featuring music from the classical period up ‘

to modern, American, holiday classics, and
also some carols from around the world,”
director Richard Teaster said.

The performance features songs sung in
ﬁve languages: English, French, German,
Latin and Church Slavonic, a dialect of
Russian. The group found Church Slavonic
particularly difficult to master due to the
language’s antiquity. ‘

Friday’s concert will be the second time
the clubperforms by candlelight..

“It gives a nice aura on a winter evening
in Pittsburgh,” the group’s president, Jared
Wilson, said.

The performance is free to students with
a Pitt ID, but Teaster and Wilson encour-
age students to get their tickets prior to the
performance at the William Pitt Union box
office. Students who arrive at the door are
not guaranteed seating.

Sounds of Pleasure
Friday 8 p.m.

‘ David Lawrence Hall 120

Admission: free

Sounds of Pleasure’s performance this
Friday is not a Christmas concert.

“We have one concert every semester,
and this is our fall concert,” said Sounds of
Pleasure’s president, Molly Hackman. “It
just happens to be close to Christmas.”

Sounds of Pleasure is an all—female a cap-
pella group that performs unaccompanied

arrangements of popular songs in an effort 7

to appeal to college students.

“We sing anything from Coldplay to Ra-
diohead to Rihanna,” Hackman said.

But singing is never the only thing on
Sounds of Pleasure’s program. The ladies
also promise dancing, skits and a guest
group from Carnegie Mellon University.

“We like to have fun,” singer Dashanna
Terry said.

“We like to perform,” Hackman agreed.

  holiday tunes and pop music

“We like to put on a show for everyone.”
Of the dancing, she admits, “It’s not a cho-
reographed dance, but we do like to dance
around.” i

Terry is most looking forward to per-
forming “Because” by The Beatles,

“It’s an awesome song, I just love it,” she
said. “We’re also singing ‘Don’t Stop Be-
lievin.’ I’m sure the audience is going to love
that, they’ll probably sing along — which
can be annoying, but at the same time, it’s
great.’’ -

C Flat Run (with guests Sounds of Pleasure
and trombone choir Bigelow Bones)
Public Health Building

Sunday 8 p.m.

Admission: free

C Flat Run may be the smallest a cappella
group at Pitt, but the members say they have
some big voices. .

. Director Sean Malloy said the co-ed
group, which has eight members, tries to
showcase each of its singers’ voices.

“All of our music is arranged by members

of the group,” he said, “and every member _

sings their own solo song at some point.”

That each member belongs to numerous
choral ensembles around campus adds a
more dynamic element to the group, said
Ethan Miller, president of C Flat Run.

Malloy said what sets the group apart is
its original compositions, a genre—mashing
mix of popular hits and original composi-
tions.

“We’ll be erformin 12 new son sat our ‘
P S 3

concert, covering as many genres as pos-
sible,” Malloy said. “Unlike other a cappella
groups, about half of our music is composed
of popular songs, and about half of our music
will be new to the audience.” ,

While C Flat Run will feature a few Christ-
mas songs in its performance, Malloy admits
that the group tried to keep the song selec-
tion more varied.

This will be C Flat Run’s ﬁrst official fall
semester concert, since the group became
an official student organization only last
year.

“We plan on covering a wide variety of
songs at this year’s Winter Concert,” Miller
said. “I can’t really say too much without
giving away some of the ﬁm, but we’ll be put-
ting on several songs that I’m sure everyone
around here knows and loves in addition to
a spread of less familiar pieces that really
are a ton of fun.”

C Flat Run will host guest groups Sounds
of Pleasure and Bigelow Bones."

Set in England during the holiday sea-
son, the ﬁlm follows a pure’-of—heart young
boy and his considerably more jaded older
brother in their attempts to rid themselves
of an ungodly sum of money found in a
sack by the train tracks. The younger boy
is obsessed with saints and charity, and
conceives adorable means of spreading the
cheer; the older brother has a distinctly
capitalist mentality. Where the cash ul-
timately winds up is almost beside the

Last year’s City Game tooka Pitt

of the rivalry, Panthers center Gary
McGhee made sure that didn’t hap-

pen again.

Gary McGhee:

“It feels really good to get the
win against one of our most rivaled
teams,” McGhee said in a post—game
press conference. “It deﬁnitely feels
good that it felt like I dominated in
the defensive zone.” :

“He did a good job of just ﬁnding
the ball in the right times in the right
areas,” teammate Ashton Gibbs said.

GREGORIAN RANT$_

Football needs a better villain than Tom Brady’s hair.

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

 

Tom Brady has 23 touchdowns and
more than 2,700 yards passing
this year, and all I‘ can think about
is his hair. 1 '
Brady and the Patriots used to
be the most hated team in all of

“football. With 9:09 to go in a game

against the Redskins in Oct. 2007,
they went for the touchdown on
fourth down at Washington’s seven

‘ V yard line. They were winning, 45-

O. _
That same fall, the league
ﬁned head coach Bill Belichick

$500,000, ﬁned the franchise
$250,000, and took away its ﬁrst-
round pick in the 2008 draft for

“use of equipment to videotape
an opposing team’s offensive or ‘

defensive signals,” as the league
termed it. For everybody else, it
was simply called “Spygate,” and
it made the Patriots’ villain status
ofﬁcial. _ ’

But two weeks ago, when an
animated Brady screamed at his
offense on the sidelines of a game
against the Steelers, he wasn’t a
villain anymore. His hair, which he
doesn’t seem to have cut this year,

. is now down to hisshoulders.

It’s the gooﬁest thing in Boston
since Manny Ramirez. '

I chuckle every time Brady runs
_his fingers through his, locks. For
years, he was the consummate pro-
fessional, a Steeler—killer who did
it all with a cheesy grin — the best
kind of antagonist. Now, he isn’t
frightening. He looks more like].P.
Losman than Roger Staubach.

Football needs a villain, and for
years the Patriots were just that,
running up scores and embrac-
ing the fact that they were dis-

-liked. But they’ve lost that edge.

Star wide receiver and occasional
mooner Randy Moss is in Tennes-
see, Belichick hasn’t been as ag-
gressive on fourth down since it
cost him a game against the Colts

" last season and Brady, well  his

hair. _ ‘

Am I supposed to hate Wes

—*We1ker, an undrafted 5—foot-9
receiver who quietly catches 100
balls a year? I can’t. The only thing
contentious about New England’s
offensethese days is the origin of
running back Benjarvus Green-
Ellis’ ﬁrst name.

The league is boring without
an antagonist, that team that riles
people up. Everybody has an opin-
ion about the New York Yankees.
You were either for or against Au-
burn last Friday; The Philadelphia
Flyershave embraced th_eir “Broad
Street Bullies” image for almost
40 years now.

LeBronJames asked us in a Nike

commercial, “Should I accept my
role as a villain?” Yes, LeBron, you
should. I won’t watch your game

in Cleveland Thursday if you ha11,e_,i,.;,v.,s\

out forgiveness cupcakes before-
hand.

Without a villain, casual fans
have no rooting interest. We’ll pull
for Mid-Major State University if
it’s trailing West Virginia by a bas_-
ket. If it’s playing Oregon State?"
Not so much.

Look at this year’s World
Series. The Giants were a great
young team with solid pitching
and a can—do attitude. The Rang-
ers were a great team with great»
hitters, clutch pitching and a feel-
good storyline.

AN OLTMANNS’ OPINION

,Stop the chants, save the coachfor now

Sports Editor Alex Oltmanns explains why football fans should push to keep Wannstedt around for at least another season ’

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

U’

You’ve probably heard it by now: the “Fire
Wannstedt” chants at Heinz Field and the
growing call from Panthers fans on talk
radio shows and around campus for the
administration to fire its head football
coach. .

The Panthers stand at 6-5 right now,
during a season inwhich they were ranked
in the preseason top 20 and were expected
to roll to a Big East Championship.

But things haven’t turned out as

Wiplanned, and there are plenty of fans who
want head coach Dave Wannstedt to take
the fallfor the team’s shortcomings.

Yet addition by subtraction is not
always the best answer, and Wannstedt
should be allowed to stay put as Pitt’s head
coach, at least for another season. _

If he’s unsuccessful next season, then
athletic director Steve Pederson could.
seriously evaluate Wannstedt’s status
as coach. For now, however, Wannstedt

(J-7»

 

should be safe.
Here’s why:
1. Firing Wannstedt would likely mean

' that the head coachwould take his assis-

tant coacheselsewhere with him. That
means offensive and defensive coordi-
nators Frank Cignetti and Phil Bennett

programs back a couple years. This is not
even to mention that the outstanding pipe-
line that secondary coach Jeff Haﬂey has
established in New Jersey could begin to
evaporate.

2. The team is just coming off its ﬁrst

Meineke..Car Care Bowl last year. That
means no coach in almost 30 years had
been able to reach the double-digit win to-
tal that Wannstedt did last season. No, the
team didn’t advance to a BCS bowl game,
but 10 wins is 10 wins nonetheless.
3._]ust last March, Wannstedt agreed to
a two—year contract extension that would

keep him at Pitt through the 2014 sea-
son. If Pitt fires him now, it will have to

buy out the rest of his contract through A

that season, all while paying a new coach.
That’s a lot of money that would go out
the window.

4. Though Wannstedt has made some

i questionable calls, it’s not his fault that

some players have made mistakes on the
ﬁeld. He isn’t the one being called, for four
defensive pass-interference calls against
South Florida, as Antwuan Reed was. He

also wasn’t responsible for the offensive T

line’s inability to protect Sunseri in the
beginning of the "season or turning the

ball over againstW_est Virginiia. Although

he can put his players in abetter position

to make plays, he isn’t responsible for

executing the plays on the ﬁeld.

5. Plenty of skeptics have been criti-
cal of Wannstedt’s defense this season.
Yes, the group has had trouble stopping
opposing offenses, like West Virginia’s
on_ Friday. But it isn’t his fault that two
of his best defensiveplayers were barely
able to play all season because of injuries.

Without a clear bad guy,  

Trietley (.11

Dan Hondal Contra Costa Times/MCT Campus

  football loses its exeitment

The easiest thing to hate in _sports right now might be Patriots quarterback ‘Tom Brady’s
haircut, seen here at the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am , a charity golf tournament.

Nobody watched. 22.3 million people
watched the Yankees beat the Phillies last
year. 14.95 million watched the Giants
win. a

The Onion slapped some dry wit on
the situation with its satirical article “Na-
tion Disappointed By Great World Series
Matchup.”

“I want to relish a losing performance
from a team that I absolutely hate or, fail-
ing that, endure a championship win from
a team that I hate in order to justify being
even angrier at their organization, their
players, and their fans,” The Onion joked.
“That’s why I watch baseball and that’s why
I watch sports.”

Football doesn’t have that hated team
right now, and its postseason might reach
the samefate as baseball’s if Cortland
Finnegan doesn’t start a ﬁght with half the
league next weekend. .

The top teams are like antacids for any
passionate sport fan’s stomach. Thejaguars,
Falcons, Chiefs and Seahawks all lead or
co-lead their divisions.

Nobody feels anything toward them. Even
when the Chiefs beat your team, you shrug
and say, “Eh, the Chiefs are alright.”

Even the Eagles have a positive vibe go-
ing. They’ve turned Michael Vick from a
booed bad boy to an MVP candidate who
has paid his debt to society.

The league ﬁned the Broncos $50,000
last Saturday because an aide ﬁlmed part
of a 49ers workout earlier this season. If

only they weren’t 3-8 and hadn-’t lost that '
game against _the 49ers, somebody might_

have cared about it sooner. If anything, all
it showed was that the 2007 Patriots would

have won without cheating. Where’s the A

fun in that? _

The hard-hitting Steelers could have at-
tained villain status, but the league ﬁnes and
ﬂagsjames Harrison so often, most people
just feel sorry for him.

The Jets are 9-2, but they’re completely

likable in every way, unless you root against
LaDainian Tomlinson’s resurgence or de-
spise former Pitt Panther Darrelle Re-
vis. They play 9-2 New England Monday
night. «
So with 12 bland teams making the play-
offs this year, only one thing can save the
excitement of the postseason: the Patriots
need to become the villain again.

The game on national television Monday
is their chance. A

Belichick, wearing the shaggiest cut- off
hoodie he owns, should go for it.on fourth
and long every time —— and make it. Brady
should throw touchdown pass number four,
ﬁve and six, and t-rot off the ﬁeld grinning
over a 49-3 victory.

And maybe after, he can cut his hair. I
