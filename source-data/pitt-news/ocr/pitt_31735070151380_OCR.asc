For The Pitt News

Pitt students are not alone in
feeling the stress of unloading an
entire paycheck on textbooks at
the beginning of each semester.

Over the last decade, prices of
textbooks have outpaced inﬂa-
tion in the U.S.

According to ajune report by
the U.S. Government Account-
ability Office, prices of new, print
textbooks increased about 82

percent between 2002 and 2012.
Overall, consumer prices rose
about 28 percent during the same
time period.

The report pointed out that
students could also use alterna-
tives to new books —- including

used books, e-books or rentals
—- which tend to cost less than
new printed books.

“However, the price of new
print books often drives the

prices of other items,” the report states.

Andi Sporkin, a spokeswoman for
the Association of American Publishers,
declined to comment on patterns in the
prices of textbooks because she did not
have access to information on what indi-
vidual publishers charge.

For students, weighing the available
options for textbook purchases can be dif-
ﬁcult. Bigwords.com, which was launched
in 2001, is one price-cornparislon site for
textbooks.

“What we do is scrape the inventory
of about 40 different retailers and rent-
ers out there,” said Bigwords CEO Jeff
Sherwood. “We calculate the cheapest
combo. We show students where to buy
their books; we don’t actually sell any.”

After working in the textbook industry

for more than a decade, Sherwood pin-
pointed a few reasons why college text-
books are signiﬁcantly more expensive
than most ﬁction and non-ﬁction books
available in stores.

“There is a captured market,” Sher-
wood said. “Once the professor decides
that they are going to require the book,
the students are required to purchase that
book. [University bookstores] don’t deal
with as much volume as the online stores
do. They have to maintain a higher mar-
gin.” g

Overhead costs for university book-
stores include rent, which can be expen-
sive, he added. Bookstores also tend to
have a lot of employees, whom they have
to pay. ,

“N inety-ﬁve percent of the time, it was
better for students to get a good deal on a

’ used textbook and then sell it back at the ,

end of the year,” Sherwood said.
He also said he would recommend that

students purchase books online rather’

than the bookstore, regardless of whether
they use a price-comparison site like his

The University Store on Fifth was not
able to comment. University oflicials and
representatives from the bookstore could
not compile responses to The Pitt News’
questions prior to deadline.

Sporkin said publishers have moved
beyond the “10—pound, $200, one—size-

ﬁts-all textbook” in favor of customized,

and digital materials to improve students’
chances of success. C ‘
Some publishers within the Asso-

ciation of American Publishers offer.”

bundle packages that include access to
the textbook, as well as online software
that allows students to get help and work

through exercises at their own pace while‘

receiving individualized feedback.
According to the June report, some
instructors are also posting their own ma-

terials online in order to reduce the costs
students must pay for books.

One instructor cited in the Government
Accountability Ofﬁce’s report said that he
posted hisiown lab manual online for his
students. Instead of paying $50 or $60 for
the manual, his students had to pay only
about $10 in printing fees. _ »

While search engines and price-com-
parison sites exist for students who need
to compare prices for assigned textbooks,
Sporkin said instructors don’t have any
such resources to aid their search in decid-
ingwhich materials best suit their courses.

answer questions on what such a resource
would look like. _

“The missing piece of the puzzle across
the board in higher education is there’s

Chelsea Manning, formerly known
as U.S. Army Pfc. Bradley Manning,

However, according to the New
York Times, an Army spokesman
said that the Army does not pro-
vide hormone therapy for trans-
gender people, and it is uncertain
whether or not the prison at Fort
Leavenworth will even allow Man-

mone therapy. It’s clear that the
military prison should do the right
thing without a lawsuit: provide
hormone therapy, suitable medi-
cal treatment and counseling and
appropriate and safe housing in
a timely manner. Mandating that
someone suffer through the psy-
chological pain ofbeing the wrong

our campus is a long way from fully embrac-
ing students who falloutside of the tradi-
tional gender dichotomy.

And in all of the recent changes at Pitt —

like the announcement of Chancellor Mark '

Nordenberg retiring at the end of the year
and updates such as renovated classrooms,

a new dorm and wireless Internet access in
residence halls —. the administration has
beensilent on an issue that has generated
controversy for more than a year, despite

student activism and criticism from The Pitt

News’ editorial board.

The current University policy regarding
transgender students’ use of public gendered
facilities (like locker rooms and restrooms)
seems more appropriate for the 19505 than

2013: The policy states that students must

use facilities that correspond with the sex
listed on their birth certiﬁcates, and stu-
dents who wish to use other facilities must
ﬁrst have invasive and expensive sex—reas-
signment surgery. Pitt Rainbow Alliance
President Tricia Dougherty ﬁled a complaint
with the Pittsburgh Commission on Human
Relations in April 2012 to draw attention to
Pitt’s current policy. ‘

Like Chelsea Manning, transgender stu-
dents at Pitt shouldn’t have to worry about

whether or not they’ll receive proper ac-
commodations — including gender-neutral
housing, restrooms and locker rooms —— and
no one should be pressured into undergoing
invasive sex-reassignment surgery. A
Hopeﬁilly, the nationwide media atten-
tion given to the rights of transgender people
will inspire institutions across the country
—— including Pitt .— to change their policies

for the better. I

Black Joe Lewis comes out firing on Electric Slave

John Lavanga
AC-3’E Editor

Electric Slave

Black Joe Lewis

Grade: B+

Sounds Like: Chuck Berry
and James Brown had a
son, and he was a badass

Though there’s plenty to say
about Black Joe Lewis — from
his ingenious use of a horn sec-
tion to his gruff, ﬁery vocals and
his James Brown—like ability to
inject his tracks with sponta-
neity and emotion, his new al-
bum can be summed up innine

words: Electric Slave is a great
rock ‘n’ roll album.

Now, the explanation. Since
its rise from the elements of
blues, jazz and country, rock
‘n’ roll has become a term so
ubiquitous that it is now mean-
ingless. It seems that in order
to explain what a rock band
sounds like, it’s necessary to
place them into a sub-sub —genre
(proto-post-rock, coined by an
avid music lover I know, prob-
ably best exempliﬁes modern

~ music’s genre problem) that en-

capsulates every inﬂuence the
band has encountered along
the way.

Not so with Electric Slave.
This is an album that, from
its ﬁrst track, comes out with
middle ﬁngers bared and over-
powering guitar riffs blazing.
It’s a volatile album that goes
back to rock ‘n’ roll basics, com-
bining elements of blues, bits
of funk, a skilled horn section
and Lewis’ palpable emotion on
every track.

What makes it a ﬂat-out
rock ‘n’ roll album, though, is
its frankness. Though it comes
steeped in blues progressions
and has the driving pace of
Chuck Berry, the album isn’t de-
rivative. It’s too heavy. There’s

too much grit to it, too much
of Lewis’ ﬁre and too much of
that sweet, sweet horn section.
If Chuck Berry played a Blackjoe
Lewis song, it would sound like
a cover. This is purely, ﬁercely a
Blackjoe Lewis album.
Stylistically, it’s hard to put
a time stamp on Lewis’ music.
Since breaking out with his
band, Black Joe Lewis and the
Honeybears, Lewis has demon-
strated his ability to change up
his structure from one track to
the next without so much as a
hitch. Some songs might ﬁt into
a funk show, while others would
work nicely at a country dance

hall. This magniﬁcent skill is
best highlighted on the album’s
two standout tracks, “Come
to My Party” and “Vampire,”
which appear back to back.
“Come to My Party,” which is
the album’s sole made-for—radio
selection, has grooving bass
lines, saccharine guitar play
and dramatic horn breaks that
make it a funk—ﬁlled dance track
that hearkens back to some of
the songs off his debut album,
Tell ‘Em What Your Name Is! It’s
easy to picture this song being
listed up on a Stax Records “best

BEER REVIEW
Pipe Organ
Pale Ale: A solid

Warm-weather
brew

Jackson Crowder
Staff Wrz'terc-

Pipe Organ Pale Ale
Brewery: Church Brew Works
Grade: B

It is an inarguable fact that the best thing to
do during a long summer weekend is drink
beer outside. There is a magical connection
between cold beer and a hot day, one akin
to baseball and hot dogs (or baseball and
beer, for that matter).

But drinking in the great outdoors
presents an important issue: What’s the
best beer for the moment? With the recent
phenomenon of pumpkin beers and their
autumn compatriots rearing their heads
in August, seasonality is officially null and
void. ’

That being said, some beers lend them-
selves to hot weather better than others
do. For instance, I enjoy Guinness Genuine
Draught in all of its richness, but I wouldn’t
call it the ideal brew to down while playing
corn hole and wearing sunglasses.

But just because day drinking in the heat
requires a certain delicate touch doesn’t
mean that you have to resort to Natural
Light or Bud Light Lime (as a side note: If
you are going to buy Natty, save yourself
some money and buy Pennsylvania Style at
$8.99 for a 24 pack. It’s no worse and will
go much further). So, on a quest for a solid
beer for outdoor relaxation, I stumbled
upon Pipe Organ Pale Ale from Pittsburgh’s
own Church Brew Works.

Pipe Organ Pale Ale pours a deep shade
of gold with an attractive, bubbly head that
maxes out at two ﬁngers thick, making it
easy on both the eyes and the palate. The
head, which dissipates quickly to become
a thick, white foam, gives off a pleasing but
not overpowering hop aroma that simply
begs you to take another sniff — and then
a sip, of course.

show in the midst of filming a third sea-

with a comedian who was receiving con-

But Chappelle did take the stage —
cigarette in hand, engulfed in a sea of
applause. He looked tired, stoic and a
little disinterested, but that did nothing
to calm down the cries of adoring fans.

Their cheers raised a crucial ques-
tion — one that might determine the
outcome of the evening. Did this crowd
want Dave Chappelle, the brilliant sati-
rist and gifted comedian, or did they
want the black guy who inadvertently
perpetuated racial stereotypes to an
audience that laughed at him, and not

Well, as he began his show with a

said they had missed him, he recipro-
cated and said he missed them, too.

But it was clear that being in front of
the audience again was a little hard for
Chappelle. For a man who is ostensibly
over-conﬁdent, Chappelle made sure
to show that he was human through it
all —— just an artist who wanted to be
taken seriously. He discussed at length
what the moral of his stand-up should
be, even talking brieﬂy about trying to
instill hope in the audience.

And although he discussed Paula
Deen and her use of the N-word, as
well as noting that Pittsburgh at least
managed to draw a few black people
to watch him perform, he also poked
fun at himself being just a “black” en-
tertainer. Chappelle told the audience

of” compilation or crammed into a ’70s
B—movie montage as everyone gets ready
to hit the town. More than anything, it
showcases Black Joe Lewis’ ability to
use his sandpaper—covered vocals and
skills as a musician when writing some
infectiously catchy tunes. I

Immediately after “Come to My
Party” cuts out, Lewis jumps straight
into “Vampire” —— a thumping, guitar-

driven Texas rock ‘n’ roll piece pulled,

still dripping, out of the Red River. It’s
the kind of song that Stevie Ray Vaughan
would have liked to hear. It’s also a les-
son in how to throw tight songwriting
to the Wind without losing control of
the track itself. The track moves along
at a languorous, bluesy pace for about
three minutes before Lewis, howling
all the way, lets his band take the reins
and drive the piece into a ﬂurry of notes
that verges on chaos, but pulls back at
just the right moment.

While these standouts will undoubt-
edly be staples of the Black Joe Lewis
setlist for years, the rest of the album

— especially the ﬁrst ﬁve tracks — can
sometimes blur together. The powerful
guitar and rough coating of these tracks
make them feel just slightly repetitive
after a time. For fans of Lewis, part of
the fun is that his music keeps listeners
guessing what the next song is going to
sound like. Blackjoe Lewis is just as good
when he’s throwing a party — like in
2011’s out—of—control jam “Booty City” —
as when he’s an angry electric-blues man.

In spite of this bit of monotony, Elec-
tric Slave remains a great rock ‘n’ roll
album, a designation that is shockingly
rare in modern music. I

needs a sweet, malty quality to balance it
out and prevent it from being one-dimen-
sional, but Church seems to have pulled off
the impossible and made a one-note beer
that actually works. The hops — East Kent
Goldings —— come through from beginning

H to end with just enough bitterness to be
refreshing, leaving thetongue tingling and
wanting more. Interestingly, the singular ‘

hop note of the beer adds to its refreshing
nature, absent of a malt ﬂavor that could
have weighed it down and made it too heavy.

This is also a rare beer that is just as

- good in the bottle as it is in a glass. Usu-

ally, pouring beer into a glass enhances the
beer’s ﬂavor by adding air into the equation.
That said, typical beers don’t have the same
makeup as Pipe Organ Pale. Generally, other
beers combine a larger variety of ingredi-
ents, adding more complex layers of ﬂavor
than this one has to offer. So grab a bottle
and koozie, because this is a beer that will
adapt to you, not the other way around.

As far as an overall grade for this beer
goes, it gets a B. No more, no less. For a re-
laxation brew, it is ideal. However, for a sip-
ping, thinking and critiquing brew, it falls a
tiny bit short. It is important to remember
that this beer is good, but not great.

To put it simply, it’s a straightforward,
hot-weather beer — a solid pale ale with
just enough bitterness to please a hop head
without intimidating a novice. It’s no sub-
stitute for Dogﬁsh Head 60 Minute IPA,
but it will get the job done in any situation
that you need it. For a day of relaxing out-
side with friends, food and Pitt football,
it’s perfect. I

riffed on how that combination had led
to Puerto Rican-looking kids.

With family on-his mind, Chappelle
talked less about what people may have
expected and wanted from him and in-
stead told stories about being a father
and a husband. To finish the set, he cel-
ebrated his wife’s birthday on stage,

complete with an entourage of his family
and friends to blow out the candles on
a cake. Whether still angry about last
night or not, Chappellewas performing
the way he wanted to.

And none of this is to say that Dave
Chappelle has become overly sentimen-
tal and rusty throughout his absence.
On the contrary, Chappelle’s social
commentary was just as informed and
scathing as ever. He still discussed the
humors of being black and how that

inexorably plays a role in his life, and
he was not afraid to talk about why he
was gone and how he always knew he
would return to the stage.

As a witness to this event, I can at-
test that it was truly an honor to be in
attendance. Chappelle is a social com-
mentator extraordinaire, and that night
he shined as a comedian, not just as a
black entertainer. He was performing
on his ownterms, discussing things he
believed were noteworthy and excelling

in each bit he did.

When the crowd was growing antsy
and rumblings about his boycotting the
rest of the tour started to circulate, I
felt that I would respect his decision if
he decided to not perform that night
——- I would certainly have understood

-his reasoning. But instead, the legend
took the stage, putting last night and his
previous exploits behind him, as he got
back down to the basics — performing
comedy. I

FOOTBALL

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

For Paul Chryst, the game of football is a

' simple one at its core. * ’ ‘

“Most football games you play in, who
controls the line of scrimmage is a team
that has an advantage.”

Those were the words of Pitt head coach
Paul Chryst last week as his Panthers pre-
pared to play the Florida State Seminoles
in Pitt’s debut as a member of the Atlantic
Coast Conference.

A week to the day after those words
were spoken, Pitt found itself on the los-
ing end of a 41-13 loss to the ‘Noles, while
Florida State controlled the line of scrim-
mage throughout the game.

“We never made them uncomfortable,”
Chryst said. “Big picture, they won the line
of scrimmage.” l

Pitt’s defensive line was unable to pres-
sure redshirt freshman quarterbackjameis
Winston, who completed 25 of 27 passes for
356 yards and four passing touchdowns.

Winston not only hadplenty of time,
but also plenty of space, as his offensive
line created gaping pockets in the back-
ﬁeld. And when Winston scrambled, it
wasn’t by force of Pitt’s pressure, but more

just a choice.

When Panthers defenders did get
within reach of Winston, Pitt struggled
to wrap up the quarterback. Winston ran
eight times for 25 yards, and scored on a
designed keeper for the quarterback from
ﬁve yards out in the second quarter.

That same quarter was the one in which
Florida State took control of the ballgame.

“I thought we had some opportunities
to make some tackles for loss,” Chryst
said. “I thought that they did a good job
of protecting when we did have shots at
the quarterbacks. They did a good job of
making plays, extending plays.” L

Pitt opened up a 7-0 lead after the Pan-
thers went 80 yards in nine plays on the
game’s inaugural drive. From there, FSU
outscored Pitt 28-3 to take a 28-10 advan-

loss of nine yards, he frequently had" to
leave the pocket and almost ran into dan-

ger when he was hit hard near the sideline.’

Savage started the game 4-for-6 with
a touchdown on Pitt’s ﬁrst drive, but it
went downhill from there, as Florida State
adjusted to Pitt’s offensive attack. Savage
ﬁnished 15-for-28 for 201 yards, a touch-
down, and a pair of interceptions.

On many of those incompletions, Flor-
ida State’s front seven — and sometimes
just front four — ﬂushed Savage from the
pocket and forced himinto off-balance
throws or to simply just throw the ball
away entirely.

But he doesn’t blame any of his team-
mates responsible for blocking for him.

“I think our offensive line did a great
job,” Savage said. “Our tight ends, running

hile being closely defended. Zach

backs did a phenomenal job of picking up
blitzers.” ’

Instead, Savage says he just didn’t
handle Florida State’s pressure “as well as
the rest of his teammates on the line of
scrimmage.

“I take full responsibility,” Savage said.
.“I gotta get the ball out quicker so I don’t
have to take those sacks.”

From the perspective of Savage’s lead
receiver, Devin Street, Florida Statejust ﬂat
out executed well. Street ﬁnished with six
receptions for a single-game career-high
141 yards.

“I think we were carrying them man-
to-man receiver—wise,” Street said. “They
did well against the run, and pressuring
Tommy.”

When the game ended, though, Pitt
hadn’t scored another touchdown since the
pass from Savage to tight end Manasseh
Garner with 10:10 on the clock in the ﬁrst
quarter. The reason, in the eyes of Street?

“It was just.-the pressure,” he said. I

nament of the season, after competing
against three other colleges Friday and
Saturday in the Tiger Invitational tour-
nament, held at the University of Mis-
souri’s Hearnes Center in Columbia, Mo.

“Four games is a lot in one weekend,
but it was a good challenge for us,” head
coach Dan Fisher said.

The Panthers won their third con-
secutive season opener by defeating
Arkansas State 3-0 in their ﬁrst match.

The Red "Wolves kept the scores close
in all three sets, but the Panthers held ,

on to close ou-t the match in three sets,

: winning 25-19, 25-20 and 25-18.

Pitt was in control right away after
claiming the first six points of the set.
The Red Wolves brought the score to 14-

12, but they were unable to take the lead. >

After fighting off four match points,
the Panthers finally got the win, 25-19.
The Panthers had a tougher time win-
ning their next two sets. In both sets,
Arkansas State generated an early lead.
In match two, junior opposite hitter
Kate Yeazel had some big hits, but none
bigger than when Pitt took its largest
lead at 22-17. In the third match, Pitt
finished strong on an 8-4 run. ‘
Junior outside. hitter Jessica Wynn

loping of the Panthers, and likely even
the remainder of its season.

Winston led the Seminoles to ﬁve
touchdowns in five red—zone trips,
moved the chains on seven of 11 third-
down plays and torched the Panthers
for 390 yards of total offense — all in
front of a sellout crowd at Heinz Field.

Florida State head coach Jimbo
Fisher, the guy who’s had the pleasure

of watching Winston all spring, down— ‘

played the quarterback’s performance.
Fisher said, “It was one ballgame, guys.
That’s it. He did a great job. As long as

he keeps the process in mind and work— ' ’

ing with great habits, he will be fine.”_

None of these stats should be par-
ticularly impressive in such a highly
touted debut, yet Pitt head coach Paul
Chryst said otherwise.

“I wasn’t surprised by him because
we’d never seen him play before,” Chryst
said after the game. “I was certainly
impressed with him. He did a good job

had at stopping him in the backﬁeld.
But extending plays is easy when he
has teammates like Greene, a four—star
recruit in 2011 who racked up 126 yards
receiving with a touchdown against the
Panthers.

It’s easy when there are players like
junior tight end Nick O’Leary - afellow
former four—star recruit who was the
recipient of three Winston touchdown

, V passes — or right tackle Bobby Hart

—— a junior who was ESPN’s fourth—best
offensive tackle in the 2011 recruiting
class. ,

The point is the, Seminoles are
stacked on offense, a lineup of former
high school stars and recruits with re-
markable pedigreesj— but the defense
is no different._Look at Lamarcus Joyner
and his nine tackles, two sacks and one
pass break—up; Back in 2010, Joyner was
a ﬁve—star recruit out of a Miami, Fla.
high school and the top prep corner-
back in the country.

Meanwhile, the Panthers played 12
true freshmen in the loss to Florida
State. The Seminoles are the superior
team, evidenced by their 2012 ACC title

9

and No. 11 pre-season ranking, but the
difference is that, of the dozen first-
year Panthers to see action, just one
was a four—star recruit.

That jewel of the class, wide receiver
Tyler Boyd,*was the lone bright spot
Monday. Boyd led the team in rushing
— again, he’s a wide—out — with 54
yards on just three carries, and pro—
vided a spark on kick returns, where he
compiled 71 yards on three attempts.

“I think I did everything I can do. I
can make more plays, but I made just
enough plays to do right, do good,” he
said after his first college game.

Even Boyd, a prized youth, himself,
knew he was stacked up against a star-
studded defense, one loaded with for-
mer top-recruits. And though he didn’t
say as much, he knew the blcoking line
ahead of him that he would need to
dodge — an area that spelled out the
clear advantage in recruiting and per-
formance between the two squads.

“I thought it was going to be really
tough [to run],” Boyd said. “But I ex-
pected too much, I guess.” I

day. Pitt lost to Missouri 3-1, by scores
of 13-25, 25-23, 14-25 and 13-25.

The Panthers struggled early, but
came back swinging in set two. There
were twelve ties during this match, and
neither team held a lead larger than
three points. However, the Tigers made
a few errors that helped Pitt gain the
lead to close out the set. 2

Senior outside hitter Monica Wignot
had a kill that gave Pitt its largest lead of
the night at 25-20. The Tigerstook the
next two points in the set to pull within
one, but thanks to another Wignot kill
and an attack error, the Panthers won
25-23. From set one to set two, the Pan-
thers saw their hitting percentage im-
prove from 10 percent to 37.9 percent.

The Tigers regained their momentum
in sets three and four by hitting 59.3
percent and 60 percent, respectively.

Yeazel led the team with 12 kills,
Zitzke had 17 assists and sophomore
setter Jenna Jacobson had 16 assists.
Redshirt freshman middle blockerjenna
Potts had five blocks and junior libero
Delaney Clesen had 10 digs.

On day two of the tournament, Pitt
once again split its matches.

In the first match of the day, Pitt
took on South Dakota. This match
took the Panthers four sets to win, as
they lost the first set.25-27 but won the
next three, 25-15, 25-16 and 25-17. Once
again Pitt saw 12 ties in their first match
against the Coyotes before-falling to
a loss.

“I don’t think we played bad the first V

set, but we lost a couple pivotal points
towards the end and kind of lost our

momentum,” Yeazel said.

It wasn’t until set two that the Pan-
thers took control. Pitt began to have
timely hits and played great defensively
to secure large margins of victory. Yea-
zel tied her career high in kills with 14,
while freshman outside hitter Maria
Genitsaridi had 10 kills. Zitzke finished
the match with 28 assists. Defensively,
Boddy led the team with 6 blocks.

The Panthers’ strong performance
hit a roadblock against Idaho State. The
Panthers lost all three sets with scores
of 25-16, 25-23 and 25-20.

In their first match, the Panthers felt
the pain of losing their most lopsided

set of the day. The Bengals’ first 5-0 run

in the set gave them a 16-14 lead, and
their second 5-0 run helped the Bengals
come back from a deficit of three to a
lead of 24-22.

Set three was a similar story for the
Panthers and the Bengals. A 7-1 run for
Idaho State helped the team take the
lead from Pitt, and the Bengals never
gave it back.

Only once in this match did Pitt hit
over 20 percent, and they finished the
match hitting 17.2 percent as a team.
Wynn added 12 kills to her tournament
total, while Yeazel added 8.

Coach Fisher is happy that the Pan-
thers won two games on the road, but

admits that his team isn’t at their best A

yet. 1
‘‘We’re still ﬁguring out who we are
