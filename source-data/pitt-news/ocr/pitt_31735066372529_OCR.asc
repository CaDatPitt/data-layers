The board of the Pittsburgh
Child Guidance Center
(PCGC) recently announced
that the agency could no longer
continue to provide direct ser-
vices to patients in light of the
funding crisis created by the
federal budget cuts in the area of
children’s mental health ser-
vices. Therefore, a decision was
made to take on a new role. that
being to support children's
mental health activities in the
Pittsburgh community as a
funding foundation and not as
an outpatient clinic. Instead of
directly treating children, the
PCGC will now make grants to
agencies in the Pittsburgh area
to carry on innovative pro-
grams which cannot be funded
by existing resources. ,

The Child Guidance Center
was formed fifty years ago by a
group of Pittsburgh citizens “to
conduct psychiatric services for
children, to train professional
personnel and to carry on
research and promote mental
hygiene in the- community."
The main function of this
agency has been outpatient psy-
chiatric care. For instance, in
1980 alone, the PCGC had 948
children clients who were either
treated or’ referred to another .
institution.

Effective January 1, 1982.

however, Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic (WPIC)
will provide the programs and
services previously offered by
PCGC. I

Enrolled at the main campus
of the University of Pittsburgh
for fall term 1981 were 22,024

according to john Yeager, vice
chancellor for planning and
budget. I
With community campus~
figures still out, this figure
represents a decrease of 23 stu- P
dents from fall I980 figures.
“This is not a negative, how-
ever," Yeager said. He added
that . tuition “income, if not

figures projected and planned.
Though there was a decrease,
Yeager said the enrollment
trend is stable. He cited some of
the new programs at Pitt such
as Saturday classes, general stu-
dies college, and computer
engineering programs for being
responsible for this stability.
K These specialized programs.
Yeager believed, have caused an
enrollment increase in (terrain

Forty years ago today, at one
o’clock on a Sunday afternoon, 84
Japanese bombers swarmed out of
the’ horizon and attacked Pearl
Harbor. M
In their wake they left eight bat-
tleships sunk or damaged, as well
as three light cruisers, three des-
troyers and four auxiliary craft
stink or damaged. 231 planes were
destroyed. The casualties were
high—over 5,000 killed and 3,000
wounded.
For the Japanese, the attack was
a complete victory, according to
Donald M. Goldstein, editor of
Gordon W. Prange's monumental
work, At Dawn We Slept, The
Untold Story of Pearl Har_bor.

it's under very close public scru

of the investment decisions; they're
made automatically purely on the
basis of performance.” i

Thomas Donnelly of Houston,
Houston 8c Donnelly, the legal
counsel for Money Market Man-
agement, concurred with Posvar
that there was no potentialconflict

of interest between the chancellor’s_

position in the fund as a director
and the university's role as an

investor.

“I don't see any facts that would
suggest any potential conflict,"
said Donnelly, who is also on the
board of "directors of Money Market
Management.

“Pitt, when it goes in and out of
that money-market fund, would do
so at whatever yield is available to
any of the other investors. Pitt
being in a particular fund would
not in any material way profit
Chancellor Posvar. His compensa-
tion for serving as a director would
not be lessened or heightened by
Pitt’s presence or absence as a
shareholder,” Donnelly said.

“I worked with him for three or

As a “disinterested" director of

medical school is ‘in no worse
financial shape than the rest of the
country's medical schools, accord-
ing to Chancellor Wesley Posvar.

“Like all other medical schools,
it has some very serious financial
limitations," Posvar said in
response to a report outlining the
school's difficulties sent from the
dean to. Gov. Richard T horn-
burgh.

“There are some medical schools
that are better off than others, but I
think that as a group nearly all of
them are in difficulty because of the
tremendous increase in costs," Pos-
var said.

The report, written by Dean
Donald F. Leon, makes a plea for
the governor to appropriate more‘
state funds to the school. The
report cites a $2.8 million deficit
for the current fiscal year, a possi-
ble loss of accreditation, lack of

academic space and skyrocketing ,

tuition hikes as problems currently
facing the school.

The report also states that the
university has had to -continually

At Pitt, because of the enor-
. mous amount of courses offered
each term, available academic
advising for undergraduate stu-
dents is a valuable resource.
Mary Wessel is one academic
adviser at Pitt. Born in New Jer-
sey, she attended Rutgers Uni-

tversity as an undergraduate

double majoring in _sociology
and philosophy. She came to

I Page 2--The Piitit News, Monday, December 7, /1981

Explaining The Art A

of Academic
Advising

graduate school at Pitt in 1977
to pursue a master’s degree in
sociology, which she has just
earned.

Her office, where she advises
approximately 100 new stu-
dents each semester and spends
about nine hours each day
doing it, is located on the ninth
floor of the Cathedral.

According to Wessel, when
advising, nobody should be
pushed in a certain direction.
Instead,‘ the students should

reflect on their decisions.

 

“For example, I usually will i
ask a student if he or she really is '

interested in their choice as
opposed to choosing it because
of outside pressures,” she said.
“'l‘he student will then try and
objettt.ively evaluate his or her
situation as to their own need
and options."

Her basic advising philo-
sophy is to make the student
aware of the many different
options Pitt offers. She also
stresses that the student is mak-
ing the choice, not their friends
or parents. She tries to make
that student realize why they
chose it, how they chose it, and
what they are doing about it.

For Wessel, advising is a
rewarding experience. First, it
offers her a lot of contact with
students and thus all of the
interesting ideas they have.
Additionally, it enables her to
know many‘ advisers and their
different philosophies.

Perhaps, most importantly,
though, advising is extremely
rewarding for her because she
begins to think about how edu-
cation fits into a larger picture.
She understands that going to
classes is not all that an educa-
tion represents. Education

instead, she said, develops a “

sense of self, a sense of social

' consciousness and reflection.

“Students should stop and
have a certain inquisitiveness
after and during scliool; they
ought to dt-velop'in school a
certain curiosity or desire to
learn," she said. “We ought to
be conscious of the times we are
living in—-we should try and
understand the current eco-
nomic atid political situation
the world is in and where a uni-
versity can help, namely, pro-
mulgate this inquisitiv'eness.”

Besides being a prudent
adviser, two of Wessel’s loved
interests are photography and
carpentry. She is currently
active in both, especially photo-
graphy. Combining her rather
extensive knowledge of sociol-
ogy with photography, she is
pursuing a career in documen-
tary photography, which
involves writing stories and
photographing them. She said
she is interested in this because
she can make people aware of
different parts of their lives
through pictures.

“I am in this field because I
am well suited for it, plus I
really enjoy doing it,” she said.

“This reflects my advising phi-
losophy becausel try and instill
this at titiide of objective evalua-
tioti of oneself in students.”
Wessel said she was unhappy
about the cuts in university
advising starting next term.
(Iurrently,' there are about 35
advisers and this iuiinber will
be retlucetl to 28 01‘ 29 next term.

What this will do, accordiiig to A

Wessel, is lessen the time of each
advising appointment.

“This will make advising
more bureaucratic because we
currently try to give each stu-

dent an hour-long appoint-
ment,” she said. “With these
cuts, though, it will probably
reduce appointments to about
15 minutes each—just enough
time to fill out the registration
form and hardly any time for
communication."

She said that the term “wor-
ried" sums up the Pitt student
body in one word.

“Students are worried about

their lives in the future—thejob

situation," she said. “‘But given
the constraints Pitt students
operate under, most do reach
their potentials.”

Reagan

By CHRIS CLINTON

President Reagan is a tough
leader but is tenderhearted with
members of his own administra-
tion, said political columnist jack
Anderson Thursday night.

Anderson spoke before a crowd
of 300 at the Jewish Community

 - Center and said even though Rea-
 gan is “ruthless” in handling Con-

gress and the Soviet Union, he has
a weakness when handling his own

National Security Adviser Richard
Allen are two examples of Rea-
gan’s inability to handle his asso-
ciates. He said that Reagan will
believe what Stockman and Allen
tell him because he is too trusting.

Anderson called Stockman an
“opportunist” and said his politi-
cal affiliation depends on “how the
wind blows.”

Although Reagan, like former
resident Jimmy Carter, had no

   

A  perience in Washington govern-

  

ment when elected, there isa differ-
ence that makes Reagan a better
president, Anderson said.

Reagan is setting the policies for

his administration, Anderson said,-

but unlike Carter, he is not imple-
menting those policies. He said
Carter would have been a success-
ful president if he had the ideas but
let others carry them out.
Anderson said Reagan's view of
the economy is simplistic, anil he
does not think Reagan and his
advisers understand the economy.
He said, however, that it is
wrong to blame Reagan for the fed-
eral debt. He said drastic cuts in

ple of the possible Soviet invasion
of Poland shortly before the 1980
presidential election.

Anderson said that the Soviets
decided to wait for the outcome of
the election so they would know
with whom they would be dealing
with in the White House. Instead
of admonishing the Russians like
Carter did, Reagan told them, after
he was elected, that if they invade
Poland, the U.S. would arm Red
China's 900 million people. To
make his threat real, Anderson
said, he sent Secretary of State Alex-
ander Haig to China shortly after
being inaugurated.

The chance that the United
States and the Soviet Union will
reduce arms production is, accord-
ing to‘ Anderson, somewhat
unrealistic.

Because the U.S. is the world’s
economic, agricultural, technolog-
ical Ieader and the U.S.S.R.'s only
the world's military power, Ander-
son said it would be tough to con-
vince the Soviets to stop their
military build up.

“The day you get Russia to lay

‘ down their arms," Anderson told

the audience. “I can get the United

States needs to “go back to the bas-
ics" where military arms are con-
cerned. He said that the weapons
cost more because they are so
sophisticated .

“The simple, basic weapons that
the Russians have work," he said.

At a press conference before the
lecture, Anderson said that the
rumor that there were Libyan hit
men in Washington may have been
just that--a rumor. He said Libyan
dictator Khadafy may have
accomplished what he intended to
do by circulating rumors.

“The key people in Washington
havevnever been so well protected
thanthey are now," Anderson said.

The statement was made before
the FBI confirmed that there were
Libyan hit men in the United
States.

Anderson has been the author of
the Washz'ngton-Mcrrv-Go—Roumi
since I969 and won a Pulitzer Prize
for his often-times controversial
column. A

It seems that college deans,
through some whim of rhetoric,
media or student body, have
been surrounded by a mythol-
ogy that projects them as des-
potic creatures arbitrarily
exercising power and disci-
pline.

Well if 50, Dean of the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences Irwin
_]. Schulman clearly breaks the
myth.

Schulman, dean at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh since I978
and faculty member since 1960,
has devoted his primary con-

cerns as dean to strengthening_
the concept and practice of a
liberal arts education rather
than power or punishment.

“I've always had a serious
interest in undergraduate and
liberal education. A few years
ago I became a candidate for the
deanship really because of my
interest in seeing what could be
done in the way ofrestoring lib-
eral education to a central place
in the college,” said Schulman
in a slightly detectable New
York accent.

resolution for Schulman to
explore curriculum reform,
Schulman said they weren't
really asking him to do some-
thing he didn’t want to do.

“That was why I became
dean—to encourage this pro-
cess of curricular reform. I con-
sider it my principal
responsibility in this job,” he
said. '

One of the purposes ofcurric-
ulum reform is to make faculty
think about what the college is,
what a college education is for
and, he, said, to address this
question of liberal education.

He called the reforms a “good
and healthy thing” because
they bring the faculty together
to talk about such wide-ranging
issues.

According to Schulman, a
liberal education enables stu-
dents to join the ranks of civ-
ilized men and women
everywhere. While learning
their value as human beings,
they learn what their cultural
heritage embodies, and they
acquire intellectual skills that
will enable them to be fully
developed human beings for the
rest of their lives.

Most students, on the other
hand, Schulman said, think
about colleges and universities
as career training institutions.

“They come here knowing
that they want to_ become
something—businessman, an
engineer, a nuclear scientist or a
lawyer. They think of the uni-
versity as a place where they’re
going to acquire that kind of
training to enter that profes-
sion," he said.

Actually, Schulman said that

the university has entirely dif-
ferent purposes.

“It’s basically not in the

career training business. It’s in

the business of research, the

pursuit of knowledge and the.

handing on of that knowledge
to each successive generation of
students," Schulman said.
“That’s what is meant by a lib-
eral education.”

Schulman received his liberal
education at the University of
Chicago. He has a master's
degree in International rela-
tions and a doctorate in Chinese
politics. He currently teaches a
course in that area.

In fact, Schulman, who
speaks Chinese, has traveled to
japan, China, Taiwan and
Hong Kong. Schulman inter-
rupted his writing of a book on
the Boxer Rebellion (an anti-
foreign uprising in China at the
end of the l9th century) to
become dean.

Nevertheless, the two and
one-half years spent on curricu-
lum reform have provided
“some of the most lively and
interesting experiences of my
life,’’ Schulman said.

Schulman said that now that
the real work of creating new
courses, in accordance with the
reforms, is beginning, he looks
forward to ‘‘trying my hand at
getting support for the program
from foundations and agen-
cies.” He said he is confident he
can do this reasonably well.

On a more day to day basis,
Schulman said his job involves
seeing roughly two dozen aca-
demically troubled students a
week. He said he never expected
this aspectof his job.

“I try to see any student who

or wardens imposing a kind of
arbitrary discipline on them,”
he said.

Schulman said he likes to
hear about not only students’
personal problems but also
complaints about courses,
faculty and administrators.

In order to avoid giving stu-
dents the runaround, “We run a
very open office. and we have a
very informal but responsible
atmosphere here," Schulman
said.

Schulman is also currently
involved in starting new high
school programs to help stu-
dents over the “unnatural gulf
between high school and col-
lege and to improve the quality
of instruction."

Schulman said he enjoys bik-
ing, listening to music, playing
the piano and camping with his
wife for relaxation.

Although Schulman said he
plans to remain at his teaching
jol) for quite a while, he

expressed an interest in spend-
ing a year in China when he is
finished.

Basically, he said, “When I
stop being dean. I'll go back to
being just a faculty member."

Pearl Harbor DayRemembered

had to do some work though. But
there wasn't that much cutting.”
The published book is only a
fraction of the l2,000 page manu-
script that Prange managed to
write. The entire manuscript will
be published in four volumes,
making it, Goldstein believes, the
definitive work on Pearl Harbor.
“He makes what happened come
alive. Prange interviewed every-
body that ever lived through Pearl
Harbor. He interviewed some peo-

ﬁe as many as seven or eight times.
  itsuo Fuchida, who led the attack

on Pearl Harbor, was interviewed
54 times, Minoru Genda, who
planned Pearl Harbor was inter-
viewed 73 times. He collected diar-
ies. He did everything."

It was Fuchida who cried “Tora!
Tora! Tora!” as the planes swept
into Pearl Harbor. According to
Goldstein, tora means “surprise”
in Japanese. The cry became the
title for Prange’s best selling work
of the 1960s, Tara! Tom.’ Tom.’

During his 37 years of study on
Pearl Harbor, Prange, according to
Goldstein, discovered information

git wasn't previously known or
onfirmed.

“The Japanese were not the little
yellow monkeys everyone thought
they were. That's how they were
depicted in the American Press.
Now we know how bright they are,
but in '41 we didn't think that they
were capable of flying three or four
thousand miles across theocean.

“That’s whatreally emerges in
this book. It's the tragedy. We were
arrogant. That great American
superiorty. We didn’t think they
could do it.”

According to Goldstein, the mil-
itary was looking for an attack, but
to the south in the Phillipines.

t's why all the warning signals,
and there plenty of them, went
unheeded.

As early as 1933, American mil-
itary had practiced war games that
simulated the conditions of Pearl
Harbor._ In 1940, the military had
an alert of nine months for a sur-
prise attack similar to Pearl Har-
bor.

In 1941, the Martin-Bellinger
and the Farthing Report “indi-
cated verbatim how the Japanese
would attack. How they would do
it. On a Sunday morning, on a hol-
iday, at 1 o'clock in the afternoon.

“We were prepared for such a

 ig, it's just that no one ever

()ne myth that Goldstein
believes Pranges book will set
straight is the Revisionist theory
that Franklin I). Roosevelt knew
about Pearl Harbor all along, and
even hired mercenaries to fly the
Japanese planes as an excuse to
get America into the war.

“He didn't know. If he did, all
he would have had to do was inter-
cept the planes off Pearl Harbor
not allow them to bomb the Har-
bor,” said Goldstein.

“Besides, Roosevelt didn't want

, to fight Japan, he wanted to fight

Germany. Every war plan we could
find was fight the war in Europe
first, then in the South Seas...”

Goldstein believes that the Revi-
sionist theory arose because Ameri-
cans couldn’t accept the fact that
they had been caught sleeping.

“No one thought that they could
pull it off. They didn't have the
aircraft, or the torpedoes for Pearl.
The harbor there is very shallow
and they needed torpedoes that
could go 30-35 feet without getting
stuck in the mud. We didn’t think
they could come up with them."

According to Goldstein, another
myth that Prange dispelled with
his research was that not all Japa-
nese wanted war with the United
States. Many didn’t think that
Pearl Harbor could be pulled off.

“The Japanese, when they
planned this attack, thought they’d
have big losses. That's why they
didn't finish us off. Nagumo says,
‘My God, what a success—let's get
out of here.’ And they went home
and didn't hit Pearl again for six
months.

“They wasted their lead. If
they'd come back and hit us again,
and knocked out our oil, they could
have gone on from there and maybe
won the war. But they underesti-
mated American resolve."

()f the eight battle ships sunk at
Pearl Harbor, six were raised and
put into action against the Japa-
nese before the war ended. Accord-
ing to Goldstein, the United
States was lucky that Pearl Harbor
is so shallow.

“If they’d hit us at a deeper har-
bor, one going 250 feet deep, none
of those ships would ever have been
raised. Japan could have won what
they wanted."

Japan didn’t want war with the
U.S., said Goldstein. What they
were hoping to do was strike
quickly, and then negotiatea treaty

.with the U.S., keeping America out
of the war.

“37 years a guy gives his life,
looks at old records, and he comes
up with a lot of what we knew
before, and a lot of what we didn't.

“In the final analysis, the Japa-
nese blew it. They were arrogant
just like we were. They didn’t think
we'd ever recover from Pearl. And
we blew it too. We knew it was
coming, we knew how it was com-
ing, we knew when it was coming.
We just didn't think they could do
it.”

According to Goldstein,“Pearl
Harbor demonstrated one lesson-
the unexpected can happen and
often does."

Pitt's Enrollment Decreases

continued from page one

In a survey of graduate stu-
dents who did not return to Pitt
this fall, the education depart-
ment found three main reasons
for this decline, according to
Wilma Smith, division head of
educational development and
services. 4

“The first reason,” Smith
said, “was financial. Students
simply chose other colleges or
universities that were cheaper."

The second reason given was

that some students chose uni-
versities that were closer to
home. Added to this was the
Complaint by some of those sur-
veyed that parking was too
much of a hassle at Pitt.

The third significant reason
for the university's decreased
enrollment was that some grad-
uate students decided to pursue

employment rather than
return to school.

Smith believed this third rea-
son to be very much related to
the state of the economy.

In the survey "there were no

negative reasons toward the
quality of the liniversity,"
Smith said. "We feel good
about that."

departments currently facing cuts,
such as the geography department,
which

feel the bail-out money
could be used for their own
department s.

Posvar, however, said that all
schools of the university are subsi-
dized just as rnuch—if not more—
than the medical sr'lt()()l.

“'l‘lrere’s a lot of people that
makeallegations around here that
‘my school makes money and your
school is subsidized‘ and so on.
That's simply not true. Every pro-
gram at this university is subsi-

versity budget, and most of them
are subsidized in some degree by
the state appropriation," Posvar
said.

Incoming in-state freshmen
faced record tuition hikes of32 per-
cent this year, while ()lll-Of-Sf’

freshmen saw their tuition hiked 5 ‘S

percent.

“The tuition is much higher
than we would like because the
state has not increased its appropri-
irtion," Posvar admitted.

He was optimistic. however, that
the state would increase its appro-
priation to the sthool next year,
which has not been signifitantly
irureased for the past If) years. A

"We think the governor will,
partly as a result of thedean's work,
improve that situation. It is one of
the great medical schools in Amer-
ica and its reputation in a number
of fields, especially clinical, is
extremely high. It's a fine school,"
he said.

A  ‘i‘iiI‘hé”‘Pit't  Monday, tieae,

continued from page one
you could develop any way where
you could inordinately profit from
such a situation. I don't know what

that circumstance would be.
“I-Ie (Posvar) receives no more or
no less in compensation than his

fellow directors andthat compen- '

sation is very much in line with
industry standards,” Donnelly
said. .

Because the amount of univer-
sity assets invested in the fund vary
frequently based upon the amount
of money Pitt has available to
invest and the interest rate of the

 fund, it is hard to estimate exactly

how much the university will have
in the fund at any one time.
In early October, for example,

A Pitt would have had at least $3.8

million in Money Market Manage-
ment. That money. which was the
university's payroll tax, stayed in
the fund gaining as much interest
as possible until the university
transferred the money into a cl1eck-
ing account at Pittsburgh National
Bank. Putting the money into the
PNB account would therefore
cover a check written for the pay-
roll taxes.

“We use‘ the money market-

-  ‘unds as checking accounts——high—

interest bearing. checking
accounts," said Joseph Dutton,
Pitt's vice chancellor for business
and finance. ' I

Because money-market funds
can be liquidated at any time,
unlike treasury notes or bonds
which must mature before they can
be cashed without a penalty, the
funds are often seen as a way to
make the most profit on existing
assets.

“It's a cash-management tool.
We can have the money available as
though it were in a checking
account yet earn the highest inter-
explained Mike
Hagan, assistant treasurer.

As of Dec. 2, Money Market Man-

agement had a seven-day average
yield of 13.1 percent for each share
and a 30-day average yield of 14.5
percent. Those yields are slightly
higher than the latest average
yields of all money market funds,
whicliiare 12.69 percent for the
seven-day yield and 13.78 percent
for the 30-day yield, according to
William E. I)onoghue’s Money
Fund Report of Ilolliston. Mass.

Dutton said that although the
decision to invest in Money Market
Management despite Posvar's posi-
tion as a director of the fund “was

I y)sed as a conflict of interest at one
'time;" the university decided to go
ahead with its investment.

“We were very concerned. We

checked up with the T. Rowe Price
Fund and with the Oppenheimer
Money Market Fund. but we could
not get the flexibility for our pur-
poses day-in and day-out of our
money transactions with any of the
other funds," Dutton'said.__
/ Posvar, however, said he didn't
remember the possibility of a con-
flict of interest ever being
discussed.

“We may have asked the ques-
tion or discussed it, but I don’t

emember," Posvar said.

“As a matter of fact, I'm totally,
removed from the operation, and
the interest of the university has no
visible effect whatever on the per-
formance of that fund. There's no
possible gain to be made on
anyone's part by this,” he said.

Posvar said that investment deci-
'sions regarding money market
funds are ma(le entirely within the
treasurer's office on a daily basis
without the chancellor's influence.

“The treasurer or someone in his

_office manages the liquid assets of
the university on a daily basis andl

i-ﬁve nothing whatever to do with

it. Their instructions are to make
the most profitable high-quality
investments they can,” Posvar said.

“It would be irresponsible ifHI

pm Ainlinviestor In Fund

invest as wisely as they can accord-
ing to the criteria of the day. It

would be completely irresponsible

of me to call him up and tell him
where to put the money,” Posvar
said. , .
' State law requires that trustees or
officers of any institution which
receives state appropriations, such
as Pitt, “take no part in decisions
involving contracts in which they
have an appreciable degree of inter-
est for the furnishing of supplies,
materials or services to the univer-
sity." As chancellor, Posvar is auto-
matically on Pitt's board of
trustees. , '1
The same law, Act 161 passed in
1971, which was integrated into
Pitt's “Resolution on Conflict of
Interest," further requires any trus-
tee or officer of the university to
disclose any potential conflict of
interest to the secretary of the board
of trustees.
john Quatroche, secretary of
Pitt's board of trustees, explained

’ that it is the pgrsonal obligation of

each trustee or officer to determine
if there is any conflict of interest
and to’ report it. If so, then the
potential conflict is reviewed by the
university's internal auditors,

Price Waterhouse,8c (2o., and then _

by the treasurer.
When it is determined that a con-
flict does exist, it is the responsibil-

ity of that trustee or officer to
refrain from either discussion of
the business in question or not vote
if there would happen to be a vote
on the matterlbefore the board of
trustees. I '

‘‘It’s an honor system to an
extent," Quatroche said.

“If he (Posvar) is aware of an
apparent conflict of interest and
he's sitting at any committee meet-
ing, regardless of what that may be,

. then he may bring that to the atten-

tion of the chairman of that com-
mittee and refrain from discussion.

“That does not mean he has to
excuse himself from listening to
that discussion, as‘ long as he
doesn't take part in any of the deci-
sions affecting whatever is under
discussion. That would hold true
for any trustee,” Quatroche said.

Posvar, because he apparently
perceived no conflict between
being a director of Money Market
Management and the university's
investment inlthe fund, did not
state that on a form which asks the
trustees if they have any conflicts of
interest, Quatroche said.

“I have to accept those conflict of
interest statements signed by each
and every trustee and officer of the
university at face. value. It's not for
me to question just because some-
one sits on a board of directors,
whether it be Federated Investors or

Posvar said that although he has

!never stated directly to the board of
trustees that he was a director of

was no. need to because it was
already a public fact.‘ _

that the trustees know what I do,

The Pitt News, Monday, D€Cf?mb€T 7. 198l

Looking Back  

It will be remembered as a year of crisis for the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. It started slowly in 1981 as we cau-
tiously watched a new President develop new economic
policies, and we all wondered if we could afford to return

for another term. We suffered through the prospects-of the _

advising center being cut, and we watched faculty
members fight among themselves over proposed curricu-
lum reforms. ,

The fall term brought a seemingly new crisis every
week. There was the ever-present threat of tuition
increases while the state mulled over its appropriations.
Vandalism and burglaries increased, a coed was allegedly

. raped, and many of us watched in horror as a football fan

died in Pitt Stadium. We learned the medical school was
heavily in debt arid faces accreditation problems. And then
came what seemed to be the greatest crisis of all—we lost to
Penn State and saw our hopes for a national champion-
ship slip away with the same apparant ease that got us to
the top in the first place.

As the fall term and the year 1981 draw to a close, The

' Pitt News looks back on some of the major stories of the

year. We believe they are important to all Pitt students,
faculty and administrators, if only for their timelessness.
They- are stories that have been told before and will con-
tinue as the major stories of 1982.

O The FAS passes its curriculum reform package. In this
year of crisis, it's comforting to know that a top story is one
of future academic prosperity. The passage of the new,
more stringent‘ academic regulations for future students is
Pitt's committmen_t to the essentials of quality education.

0 The medical school faces a $2.8 million deficit and
problems with its accreditation. This staggering deficit
will not only push Pitt medical school tuitions higher, but
all University students will eventually foot the medical
school bill through the university's general fund.

0 A Pitt football fan dies in the stadium, a coed is
allegedly raped on Forbes Avenue outside the Towers, and
vandalism, property damage and burglaries increase in
our buildings and dormitories. Sometimes the politics of
emergency medical care or the problems of policing
hundreds of 19 and 20-year-olds are not sufficient explana-
tions for those fallen victim to the false sense of security on
the Pitt campus.

0 As arbiter of student affairs, the Student Government
Board will always be a major story. Each serhester, every
Pitt student turns over $24 to this board to appropriate as it
sees fit, yet less than 10 percent of the students turn out for
SGB elections. There is some hope for the SGB, however,
as the turnout of candidates for the board nearly doubled
in this fall's election. »

O The university asks the state for money and the state_
views the requests as unrealistic in the continuing battle
between inflation and the demand to keep taxes down.
Expected to be caught between the rock and the hard place
are the Geography Department, the advising center and all
Pitt students who face tuition hikes and student loan
cutbacks. -

0 And finally, there are obviously those still suffering
through various stages of catatonia over Penn State's 48-I4
drubbing of Pitt. Imagine the shock of one alumnus who
allegedly bet $10,000 on his beloved Panthers. What's
worse, he probably gave points. But this is probably the
most appropriate note on which to end things, for not
only is there room for some national redemption against
Georgia on New Year’s Day, but the return of nearly 20
starters and three All-Americans makes payback look
much sweeter for next November.

It also gives The Pitt News the opportunity to wish
everyone the best for the holidays. and may a New Year's
Day victory signal a better I982 for everyone.

Absence of Malice’ : Entertaining 

BY MATT MESSINGER

Perhaps once a year a movie
comes out that outrages a spe-
cific group and that certain ele-
ment makes it a must-see for the
public. This year's provacative
film is ABSENCE OF MAL-
ICE. The outraged group is
called journalists. The first
amendment is at stake here, and
the subject is important enough
that the public has a responsi-
bility to see why. Journalists at
Pitt aren't any different.

Before I continue, I will
reveal my bias. I am the Pitts-
burgh Campus Representative
for Columbia Pictures. I have a
responsibility to represent
them, but I also am one who
never is shy to give my opinion.

ABSENCE OF MALICE con-
cerns a journalist, Megan Car-
ter, played by ‘Sally Field, who is
slyly leaked information con-
cerning the son of a deceased
Mafia leader, who, may or may
not be the prime suspect in the
disappearance of a local union
boss. Paul Newman plays
Michael Gallagher, Megan's
prime suspect and eventual love
interest. Megan hastily puts
together a headline story con-
necting Gallagher with the
union boss disappearance. It is
here that she makes an obvious
flaw. Although she is absent of
any rrialice in the story she has
written, she has not made a
strong attempt to contact Gal-
lagher for his side of the story.
Isn't it only fair that the accused
be asked to comment? Perhaps
then we could view the news-
paper in this film as a responsi-
ble practitioner of the first
amendment. .

After a special advance
screening I held recently, a
newspaper writing class that
was invited was . asked to
respond to the ethical subject
matter of truth.

Liane Norman, Newspaper I
professor, said “Tlie movie
raised an important issue with-
out exploring it thoroughly.
The reporters seemed careless.
They didn't do the kind qt
checking that would have pre-
vented the Paiil Newman char-
acter from being slandered."

1 “Why does Megan Carter, a
dedicated. truth-seeking report-
er. print whatever isthanded to
her without verifying any of the
information?" asked one
student.

Another student said “This is
a movie that deals with decep-
tion. Megan is far too” naive to
even be considered 2! joiirtialist
and her staiidards are polar
opposites to those centeri-(I
around journalisin."

Tliere was, in fact, no obliga-
tory clean—ciit view of reporting

that had to have been shown.
The screenwriter, Kurt
Luedtke, the past Executive
Editor of the Detroit Free Press,
wrote the script for entertain-
ment purposes. He had no
responsibility to show the way
the press is in reality. The
screenplay, as ingenious and
witty as it_ is, does not necessar-
ily ring true.

The question now remains:
Why would he write a movie
that makes total fools out of the

» profession that he spent years

practicing? Perhaps he just
wants to make us think. It’s not
totally improbable that a story
could be written and printed,
without your knowledge, sus-
pecting you of a certaintcrime
that you haven't committed. It’s
not likely. though, if the report-

er has done his or her fact;

checking homework correctly.
Megan Carter does come off
as an irresponsible journalist,
but it was intended. She was act-
ing under the whim of an even

more irresponsible government
investigator, played brilliantly
by Bob Balaban, who leaked the
story to her.

In the end, as you might want
to know, Gallagher gets even
with the newspaper that has
ruined his reputation, closed
his business and provoked his
best friend to commit suicide. Is
there enough injustice done?

The film is relevant to the
adage that things aren't always
what they seem. In today’s
society, with its modern media,
people have a right to question
the practices of the news media.
Why shouldn't we? They are
only human beings acting in
the best interests of the public.

I do urge all who are reading
this to see ABSENCE ()F MAI--
ICE this Christmas. It is defi-
nitely the most important and
consistently entertaining movie
of the year. Maybe you will then
appreciate more of what goes
into what you are now holding
in your hands. 7

...Or Irresponsible?

By WALTER WATSON
Communication is a problem
with director Sidney Pollack’s
latest film. It aspires to give
audiences the inside scoop on
the journalism profession and
the way it is put to use in 1981.
But because Absence of Malice
attempts to corral a wealth of
equally guilty parties, with var-
ious objectives and various
motivations for action (too
many), the film leaves audien-
ces either buzzing with the
question “Who can you trust?,"
or simply discounting the rhe-
toric and accepting screenwriter
Kurt Ludedtke’s story as just a
story. (Accuracy? Yes. Art
imitating life? Forget it.)
Sally Field’s cliaracter,‘
Megan Carter, a reporter for the
Miami Standard, is shown as a
waif, an irresponsible reporter,
Hungry for the big story, she
doesn't mind breaking all the
rules to get front-page news,
even if the sources of her infor-
mation are based in rumor.
Carter is duped iti_to printing
a story about Michael Gal-
lagher (Paul Newman), since a
government crime task. force
suspects that Gallagher has
information concerning the
diappearance of a local union
leader. ~
Gallagher's father was a
bootlegger, his uncle is the resi-
dent chieftain of the Mafia, but
Gallagher is clean. Yet the head
of the task’ force, Eliot Roscn
(Bob Balaban) is desperate for
information on the case, and
creates the leak to Carter to
“squeeze” information out of
Gallagher. Qartt’r is too anx-

ious to run information that
“the public has a right to
know" about. In her haste, Gal-
lagher's business falls by the
wayside. .

Teresa, Gallagher’s ‘close
friend, who wishes to keep her
name out of the Standard, is
exposed in trying to share infor-
mation with Carter about Gal-
lagher’s innocence. Carter
publishes every word the
woman had hesitantly offered
in confidence, and Teresa
(Melinda Dillon) ends up tak-

. ing her own life because of the

exposure.
Field's portrayal of her
unsympathetic character is
truly worthy of some praise; it
will not be her fault that jour-
nalists across the country will
bemoan the depiction of Megan
(Zartcr, her editor and others in

P the media as whores.

At face value, Absence of Mal-
ice is not a vicious assault on the
media. Rather, it is a story that
says everyone is to blame for the
relationship between media

' and society; there are dues to

pay for those who irresponsibly
ignore the rules; there are
rewards for those who try their
damnedest to hold to some
framework of fairness.
However, since the characters
are ultimately iinl)elievablc, the
movie falls short of making a
moral statement about journal-
istic cthics. Instead, we are
simply left with a distaste for
the media, for joiirnalisin and
for women journalists. For a
movie that attempts to talk
about truth. it actually contains
niore“distortion “than insight.

Dear Editor:

We as nursing students are dis-
gusted, to say the least, at the Nurs-
ing Student Organization's (NSO)
rash and unreasonable endorse-
ment for student government presi-
dent during the recent SGB
elections. tWe feel that the nursing
student vote was poorly repre -
sented as a whole.

Criteria for selecting a candidate
should not be based on loyalty to
friends or be an effort to spite other
candidates. It has been revealed
that the nursing student non-
endorsement of Colleen Clarke, a
junior nursing student, was based
on a decision she made in regard to
a single issue.

The incident occurred while
Clarke was chairman of the Alloca-
tion Committee. She abstained
from voting on a nursing-related

‘issue involving a conflict of inter-
est. NSO had appealed to the Allo-
cation’Committee for money to
furnish hospital recruiters with
food during a recruitment seminar.
All members of the Allocation
Committee voted against this
proposal; however,
abstained from voting since she
considered herself partial. Even if
she would have voted in favor of
the proposal, the petition would
still not have passed.

‘ Unfortunately for members of
the entire nursing student body,
this was enough to sway NSO
endorsement away from Clarke
and to Me] Coleman. We feel this
was not sufficient criteria on which
to base this decision. Constantly,
we as nursing students are being

Jewish
Group
Formed

if} By BRENDA LEVIN

The Jewish people and the Smu-
of Israel are facing some very chal-
lenging times. ()ur history has not
been a dull one, and from all indi-
cations, things are not about to
change.

And if history is to be a guide, a
relatively small number of com-
mitted Jews will actively face the
issues that face all Jews. This pre-
dicament has been, and will proba-
bly continue to be true on the
college campuses in the United
States.

The universities in Pittsburgh,
unfortunately, are no exception.
Several weeks ago, Amos Mendel,
community Shaliach, was
asked to speak about the recent
crisis—Sadat's assassination.

At first, I was pleased to seea full
house in the Hillel Lounge; how-
ever, when I surveyed the audience
I found all age groups and too few
students.

Cershon Peleg, the former Shah-
ach, told me, “you would never
believe that there are 4,000 Jewish
college students in ,Pittsburgh
because they don't gather together
for activities."

Gershon expressed his concern
for the lack of involvement among
students and hopes there will be a
change in the near future.

“I am working for a change in
As the newly
appointed president of Student
Israel Alliance, I hope to build sup-
port for Israel on campus. SIA is for
students who have a particularly
strong interest in Israel and the
Jewish people, and also for stu-
dents who want to cultivate these
attributes.

Here are just a few of the events
scheduled: Israel Week, Scholar in
Residence, Israel Parade, Aliyah
Seminar, discussion groups, Jew-
ish Arts Festival, films and socials.
If you are interested in creating a
new Jewish feeling on campus, I’
urge you to call Caryn Bluestein,

told to get ‘ourselves involved in
lower campus activities. As profes-

sional nurses, it will be our respon-'

sibility to be involved in commun-
ity activities. Yet during the one

chance we have to show the rest of‘

the campus that we want to be
involved, we! are not even sup-
ported by our own “leaders."

We feel that it was not correct for
NSO to expect partiality. Clarke
has proven herself as a leader and
has performed t-he expected func-
tion associated with her role. As a
member of the Allocation Commit-
tee, she has offered her time and
help to the organization whether
accepted or not.

In conclusion, we feel obligated
to state that Clarke was misrepre-
sented to the nursing students as
well as the entire Pitt student body.
We congratulate Todd DeL-uca on
his victory, yet at the same time we

feel an obligation to Clarke as fel-
low nursing students.

If NSO would have only taken
the time to review Clarke's past
SGB record and that of the other
candidates, they would have seen-
the nonpartiality shown by Clarke.
Too bad NSO (lid not take the time

V to get to know Clarke or the other

candidates in this respect.
We do not wish to offend any of

the nursing students in this letter. «

We realize that many of our fellow
students voted for Clarke and they
too feel misrepresented by a few
token officers. We challenge NSO
to present the criteria on which
they based their endorsement of

Revived Pitt Trades Apathy for Effort, Wins

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

While watching his team eek out
a win against lowly Davis and

' Elkins, Pitt Coach Roy Chipman

\

‘ second
remaining to ice the victory, 67-64..

made a decision. With a wealth of
young, hungry talent itching to

I play but sitting on his bench. the

second-year coach was not going to
hesitate to start or play the young
players if the apathy that had char-
acterized Pitt’s first win continued.

And so, Chipman, determined to
stop this apathy before the Panth-

ers get into the meat of their sche-

dule, made some changes in Pitt’s
94-77 win against St. Francis.
After watching Charles Thomp-
son and Chip Watkins play impor-
tant roles in Pitt’s win against
Davis and Elkins, and Darrell Gis-
sendanner and Roosevelt Kirby
being woefully ineffective, Chip-
man benched the two upperclass-
men in. favor of the rookies.
Whether the move was a ploy to
anger Gissendanner and Kirby into
some inspired play or just as Chip-
man said, “becauseThornpson and
Watkins were the better defensive

_players," it worked. Oh, did it

work!

The two freshmen, setting the
tone for the game early, went out
slashing and hacking, but also
pressuring. Picking up 10 fouls in

the first four minutes of the game,

the Panthers established two
things:

First, it got them into obvious
foul trouble. That’s okay, though,
because it took the Red Flash out of
their’ run-and-gun offense, made
them tentative and made them look

over their shoulder for those

slashers.

But while the slashers, Thomp-
son and Watkins, set the tempo, it
was the veterans—with a little help
from yet another freshman-that
won the game.

Probably seething on the beiich
over their demotion, Gissendanner
and Kirby were reinserted into the
game after four minutes and they
played angrily. Kirby, who srcored
17 points and hauled down nine
rebounds, finally showed the asser-
tiveness that had been promised
ever since he was signed out ofjun-

ior college.

_ Gissendanner, scoreless for the
two games, used his speed to har-
rass the Red Fla h and to clear him-
self on the baseline when St.

Francis used a press to try to get‘

back into the game. Gissendanner
scored 10 points in the game.

But it wasn’t until freshman cen-
ter Andre Williams came off the
bench to score 14 points, on a per-
fect five for five shooting night
from the floor and four for four
from the foul line, that the game

ittUpsets Clemson in aclassic

By MARIE HUFF

The'Pitt Lady Panther basket-
ball team clinched the Pitt Classic
this weekend, toppling the 17th-
ranked Clerrison Lady Tigers, 67-
64., National College came back
from a 79-62 loss to‘C1emson to
take the consolation’ game over
Bowie State, 94-73.

The win puts Pitt at 5-1 for the
season, and maycatapult them into
the Top 20 on the Associated Press
poll. In the first round, the Lady
Panthers handily defeated Bowie
State, 112-62, setting some new
records along the way.

“This (Clemson) was a critical
game for our program,’-’ said

jCoach Judy Saurer. “We have to

i start beating top-ranked teams to

get national attention.”

Pitt’s win over Clemson should
open some eyes. The Lady Panth-
ers came back from a35-32 deficit at

.. halftime to record the upset. Deb-

bie Lewis drove for two lay-ups,
Pam Miklasevich hit a shot from
‘the topof the key, and Gail Augh-
burns banked one in from under-
neath in the opening four minutes
of the second half to give Pitt a
40-35 lead.

- Lewis converted a three-point
play at the 15:56 mark to give Pitt
their biggest lead of the game, 47-
39. Clemson quickly closed the gap
to four, 47-43, on shots by Peggy
Caple and Barbara Kennedy. Pitt
maintained that margin until the
3:15 mark, when Celia Slater hit a
10-footer to bring Clemson within
.one, 60-59.

Pitt’s defense quickly buckled
down, allowing only a lay—up by
Caple in the next two miniutes.
Meanwhile, Carol Dugan swished
two 20—footers and Jennifer Bruce
added a lay-up to rebuild the Lady
Panther lead to five, 66-61, with 59
seconds remaining.

Clemson’s All-America,
Kennedy, hit the first side of a one-
and-one, then added a bucket from
. underneath. The Lady Tigers were
forced to foul intentionally, but
they fouled the wrong person.
‘Clemson sent Lewis to the line for
two shots, and Lewis swished the

shot with 11 seconds

away as Kennedy missed a sliot at
the :05 mark, and her next attempt
was blocked by Lady Panther
Aughburns. , '

“I think we did a good job under
pressure,” said Saurer. “Our interi-
sity level is getting higher with
every game, yet at the same time we
are keeping our poise."

According to Saurer, the game
plan was to wear down Clemson. A
key factor, however, was the play of
Pitt's center, Aughburns. In the
second half, Saurer switched her
assignments on the man-to-man
defense, putting Aughburns on
Kennedy. The move paid off, as
Aughburns held Kennedy to just
two field goals the entire second
half. ‘

Kennedy and Lewis shared the
game’s high-scoring honors with
27 points each. Bruce added a dozen
in the win. Aughburns led Pitt
with 15 rebounds, followed by.
Miklasevich with 11.

In the first game, Pitt set three
team records en route to a 112-62
win over Bowie State. The Lady
Panthers came out filing, burning
to a 14-4 lead in the first four min-
utes of play. Lewis connected on
two free throws and hit two
buckets, Bruce scored twice on
feeds from Lewis, anti Miklaseyich
added a pair of 10-footers in the
offensive burst. From that point
on, it was clear sailing for the Lady
Panthers. At halftime, Pitt held a
19-point margin, 56-37.

Pitt’s 112 points was a new team
scoring record, eclipsing the mark
of 109 set in 1975. It was also a new
Fitzgerald Field House scoring
record. The Lady Panthers also hit
50 field goals, breaking the old
mark of 46 set in the 1977 season.
The final mark to fall was the team
rebounds. The Lady Panthers
came up with 81 rebounds, passing
the old mark of 73 set in 1977.

Lewis led Pitt with 21 points.
Miklasevich and Aughburns added
12 points and 14 rebounds apiece,
and Carol Dugan had 11. Impres-
sive coming off the Pitt bench were

Men Swimmers Bide Time with No.3 Finish

The Panther swimming and.div-
ing teams returned from the two-
day Penn State Relays with third
place, losing only to the two teams
that were both shaved and tapered.

West Virginia, the winner, and
the University of North Carolina
in second place, both shaved the
hair from their arms, legs and
chests, in addition to cutting prac-
tice yardage down during the past

couple weeks to allow for very fast 1

do this until'Easterns or Nationals.
Pitt ‘head coach Fred Izewis said,
liheir shaving and tapering was a
psychological handicap for any
learn not sliaved and tapered, but
from their times, you probably
couldn’t tell, as no National cuts

close to them without shaving, sol

‘‘That’s the meet we”re aiming

our NCAA Division 1 cuts in home

Outstanding performers for Pitt, -

as usual, were the ‘team backbone’

Pitt’s freshmen showed their
strength as Ed LaNoue powered to
a 21.5 split to open up Pitt's 200-
yard freestyle relay. It was
LaNoue's lifetime best time, and
puts him among the top 50-yartl
freestylers in the East.

Freshman Ed Bergan led off in
the 400-yard medley relay with a
100-yard backstrdke time of 53.0

opponent’s threat, but would have
won last year's Eastern title.

“Andre Williams showed
tonight that he deserves to be play-

With Pitt down l3-l2, Williams
tipped a ball in, hit a turnaround
jumper, hit two foul shots, another
jumper and a tip in, and Pitt was
ahead to stay, 32-22.

After holding on to a 10-point

enlarged the spread further on the
strength of Clyde Vaughn’s game-

Qualify for

Nationals

BY JODY GIDLEY

Despite its No. 2 finish, the Lady
Panther swim team returned from
this weekend’s Penn State Relay
Meet with a great deal to cheer
about.

Even though they finished
second, Pitt Coach Dave Belowich
was delighted with his team's per-
formance because the 800-and 400-
yard freestyle relay teams qualified
for nationals, as did senior Amy
Jackson in the 100-yard butterfly.

The University of North Carol-
ina Tar Heels, the No. 3 team in the
nation last year, captured-the meet
title with a total of 342 points fol-
lowed by Pitt and Penn State with
totals of 306 and 280 respectively.

Friday marked the opening of
competition. Swimming that
night for Pitt in the 800-yard frees-
tyle relay were Jackson, Diana-
Firth, Sue Heon, and Jan Ujevich.
The foursome finished second in
the event with a time of 7:364, just
14 one-hundredths of a second
behind first place finisher UNC.

Belowich said the relay did a
“very nice job" to beat the national
cut-off time by a little more than
two seconds.

Competition resumed Saturday
and swimming in the 400-yard
freestyle relay for Pitt were Uje-
v.ich, Valerie Murphy, Nancy

CFA lrked at Convention,

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Some leading members of the
Collegiate Football Association,
dissatisfied with the results of the
Dec. 3-4 NCAA special convention
on reorganization, have renewed
their threats to negotiate a separate
television pact at the risk of leaving
the NCAA.

The CFA movement, led most
vocally by Oklahoma, has set a
Dec. 14 deadline for its members to
decide whether to proceed with a
$180 million football television
contract with NBC at the risk of
NCAA sanctions, or to stick with
the $263.5 million deal the NCAA
has negotiated with ABC and CBS.

The CFA members in favor of
the NBC pact are chafing over the
results of the special convention,
which defeated the CFA’sreorgani-
zation proposal to createa football
division, Division IV, to free the
big-time football schools from con-
trol by the voting majority of
smaller schools.

Instead, the convention voted to
reorganize by changing the criteria
for membership in Division I-A.
The new criteria raises the attend-
ance requirements for I-A member-
ship and drops the so-called “Ivy
League Rule”. The Ivy League

" rule allowed schools to qualify for

I-A if, among other things, they
fielded.l2 varsity sports.

 

The new criteria should pare l-A
from 137 members to about 100,
but the CFA had pushed for criteria
that would have dropped that fig-
ure to about 80 schools. The CFA
maintains such a decrease was
necessary to free them from limita-
tions of schools that did not share
the CFA's high level of

committment—-especially mone-
tary committment——to athletics.
Such freedom would allow the
bigger schools to better “control
their own destinies,” according to
the CFA.

Threatens to Blt NCAA

After the convention ended Fri-
day, the members of the CFA-—
which include 6l of the nation's
top football schools such as Pitt,
Notre Dame, Georgia and Ala-
bama, minus the Big Ten or PAC
l0—met separately to discuss the
rules changes.

Some CFA members were espe-
cially displeased that the matter of
television or “property” rights had
been tabled, as expected, until the
NCAA annual convention in
January.

At the CFA meeting Friday, sev-
eral top-ranking officials from
Oklahoma, Penn State Athletic
Director-Coach Joe Paterno, and
Chuck Neinas, executive director
of the CFA, spoke to the members
about the television plan, accord-
ing to Pitt Athletic Director Cas
Myslinski.

According to Myslinski, the Dec.
14 deadline for the CFA schools is
not intended to form the group’s
position going into the January
NCAA convention. Rather, the
deadline will allow the CFA to get
a barometer on its members’ desire
to pursue a separate contract with
NBC.

Myslinski said reports that Pitt
would stand to make an additional
$1 million if it went with the CFA
TV deal rather than stick with the
NCAA “are not necessarily true."

“It's possible that we would have
to get lights and comply with var-
ious other things. It depends on a
lot of things," Myslinski said. Such
“other things," besides equipping
Pitt Stadium with lights, could
include a willingness to move
select games to Pittsburgh's Three
Rivers Stadium, scheduling games
for Saturday nights and changing
the dates of games.

While Pitt football coach Jackie
Sherrill has expressed a desire to see
Pitt Stadium equipped with lights
and to schedule night games, he
has hedged at playing at Three
Rivers Stadium _in the past.

Lights at Pitt Stadium have been
on the drawing board for several
years now but the cost—estimated
between $1 million and $1.5
million—has been a big stumbling
block. If Pitt were to go with the
CFA-N BC contract, equipping the
stadium with lights may become a
competitive necessity.

NBC wants to schedule Saturday
night prime-time games as a regu-
lar feature of its college football
coverage.

As for the CFA Dec. 14 deadline,
both Myslinski and Pitt Senior
Vice Chancellor Jack Freeman,
who also attended the convention,
said Pitt is noncommittal for now.
Freeman said he will submit some
suggestions to Pitt Chancellor

Wesley Posvar so that Pitt will

Which brings us to the All-
Tourrrey team. ()nce again, the
selections did not include some of
the tourney’s top players, if the per-
formance was the criteria. Pitt did
not have a single player on the All-
Tourney team. Tlrose honors went
to Barbara Kennedy of Clemson
(28.5 ppg.), Kandy Crosby (22 ppg.)
and Myra Warren (20.5 ppg) of
National College, Lisa McDonald
of Bowie State (20 ppg), and Cissy
Bristol of Clemson (I6 ppg). Tlie
Most. Valuable Player, and rightly
so, was Pitt's Lewis. Lewis aver-
aged 24 points a game and recorded
I-1 assists and eight steals in the
two—day tournament.

“I feel that Gail Aughburns,
Carol Dugan and Jennifer Bruce
should have been on the All-
Tourney team," said Saurer. “Gail
is so steady a player, and Dugan
and Bruce play with such
intensity.”

Aughburns could rightfully be
called the unsung hero of the tour-
nament. The 6—3 center averaged
10.5 points a game, while grabbing
a total of 29 rebounds, tops of
anyone in the tournament. Angli-
burns also stole the ball eight
times, often in key situations. And
most importantly, she shut down
Kennedy, the All-America.

The Lady Panthers will face

By CHRISTOPHER BORGIA

The Penn State Invitational held
this weekend boasted a strong tour-

not able to put a man in the finals.
Several Panthers wrestled well,
however, enabling the team to
come away 15- I 8 in match
competition.

(loach Rande Stottlemyer
thought his team’s performance
was “not bad" after a first round
that devastated the Panther squad,
which lost 9 out of 10 bouts.

Although there was no team title
awarded, North Carolina came
away with three champs, ahead of
both Michigan and Rider, who had
two, and Penn State, Clarion, and
Syracuse each with one.

Over the holidays the Pitt

The quickest way to get
emergency money.

These days a trip to the college book-
store can reduce your available funds to
some small change. Luckily, that’s about
all you need to make the one phone call
that can replenish your depleted funds
in a couple of hours. Here’s what to do:

1: Call home. Report the situation, and
tell the folks they can get emergency
cash to you fast by phone.

2 u Ask them to call Western Union’s
toll—free number, 800-325-6000 (in Mis-
souri, 800-342-6700), anytime, day or

night. They charge the money and ser-
vice fee to their MasterCard* or VISAT

card. A Western Union Charge Card
Money Order, up to $1,000, will be
flashed to the Western Union office or
agent nearest your emergency.

3: Pick up your money—-—usually within
two hours--at the local Western Union
office or agent. There are 8,500 nation-
ally, except in Alaska. Conveniently,
about 900 locations are open 24 hours.
It’s that easy.

Olsen a Killr on Court

By JOE KELLY

The st ene is set. It is the ('Il2,llll-M

pionsliip llllrlltli of the IQAIAW
Division I Regionals (lliainpion-
sliips at Pitt three weeks ago. Only
two learns have survived until this
game antl only one, l’itt or (leorge
Wasliiiigton, will be invited to the
National (lhampionsliips.
A fired-up Pitt team is qiiiekly
putting an end to (Leorge
Washington’s dreams. It is game
point and an enthusiastic Paula
Olsen signals setter julie Gaul to
set her up for the spike. After a
last—diteh effort by (‘Leorge
iiVVashington to save the point,
, Gaul gets her chance and feeds the

ball to Olsen, who slams it through i

a hole in the defense and sews up
Pitt’s suctiessful bid for the region-
als.

"I wanted that last spike," said
Olsen, the Lady Panthers’ senior
captain. “Julie gave me the spike
in regionals. I saw that the defense
was slow in reacting to the set, and
I spiked the ball through the hole
that they created."

Olsen, a senior from Bedford
Hills, New York, began her sports
career at Fox I.ane Iiligh Sehool,
where she play‘ed soft ball, basket-
ball and volleyball. ller interest in
r'olleyball grew as she played, in
addition to four years of high
school hall, on a USA Olympit‘
Developmental team and a USVBA
Pepsi team.

“At first, my jumping was horri-
ble. The (roaches wanted me to be a
setter, but I knew that I wanted to
be a hitter," Olsen said.

She remained stubborn, and
after three years on the USAVBA
Pepsi team that practiced four
nights a week, she developed into a
Sll(‘(T(’SSftll hitter.

“IVSVBA gave me the most expe-
rience. I received more attention
and I learned by playing and
watching others here." she said.

Pitt heard about Paula through
toaehes and players who wen-asso-
tiiatetl with different I’S\"BA
teams. Olsen derided to tome to
Pitt l)e(’ause "it has the best volley-
ball program in the Iiast."

She is a physical education
major who hopes to teach and
coach after graduation. She has
been a four~year starter for Pitt,
having played a major role on its
three l‘iLlSl(’l”ll Regional champion
teains.

Any player’s senior year is one
full of emotion. esperially when
one realizes that it could be the end
of a long career in a sport that the
athlete loves. ’

“If we didn’t win regionals, our
season was over," iOlsen said. “It
has just started to hit me that time
1;‘ running out. I'm glad that we
have until December."

Though it’s possible she could
play volleyball after college, Olsen
said, “Tliere are professional vol-
leyball teams, which consist of four
men and two women, but I don't
think that Iwould ever play profes~
sionally. I’ll probably play for a
club team. My immediate plans are
to go back to New York to teach.
coach and get my master‘s degree."

Shelton Collier, the Lady
Panther roach, sees Paula as the
backbone of the Pitt team. “Paula
is one of the hardest and most con-
sistant spikers in the hation. She is
a legitimate All—Ameri(ia candidate
