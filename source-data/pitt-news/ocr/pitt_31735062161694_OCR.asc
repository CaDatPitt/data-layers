State Democrats,
Republicans Team Up
For Big Business

By LEOPOLD KOEBERLEIN

Out of Philadelphia late last
week came a political story
which adds another weird twist
to one of the most bizarre pri-
mary campaigns that has ever
been chiseled upon the Key-
stone State’s political facade.

Here in the western part of
the state the press and air have
been ﬁlled with tales of the tur-
moil that has reared its ugliness
in the inner circles of the so-called
idealistic Democratic party.

The exposes of Charles J . Mar-
giotti would almost be enough
for Mr. Average Citizen to won-
der if corruption and sell—outs
can be evaded in any administra-
tion that the state might have.

But now——in addition to the
charges that legislation has been
sold to interested parties, that
Philadelphia contractor Matt Mc-
Closkey, Jr., has not let the Dem-
ocratic party’s “ideals” interfere
with his business, and that Demo-
cratic chairman Dave Lawrence
has not been above suspicion. in
wielding his political power—the
Philadelphia Record has discov-
ered a strange alliance between
Jack Kelly and Jay Cooke, Phil-
adelphia political chairmen.

Political Twins . . .

Kelly, labeled as front for Mc-
Closkey (who has little Charlie
Jones, gubernatorial aspirant, on
his knee), and Cooke, similarly
a front for Republican oil czar J 0-
seph N. Pew (who is heart and
soul behind Judge Art James for
his party’s candidate) sat down
last Monday to divide voting ma-
chine inspectors.

James and Jones, says the Rec-
ord, are political twins—they look
alike, think alike, talk alike,
would act alike if elected——and
both are stooges for the big inter-
ests.

It does not seem inconsistent,
therefore, that the Democratic and
Republican machines in Philadel-
phia——c-r in Pennsylvania as a
whole—should get together and

iron out little differences such as

who shall inspect voting machines.

There seems to be more than
a slight truth in the statement
that if both James and Jones win
the primary nominations for gov-
ernor, the interested parties be-
hind these candidates really
would not be seriously worried
about the ultimate winner in No-

vember: each would be pledged '

to perform practically the same
duties gtowards those who have
supported them.

They Pay . . .

Joseph N. Pew, mentioned
above, chief contributor and
dominant factor of the Repub-
lican party, is an ultra-conserVa-
tive, if not reactionary. He wants
a State sales tax. His Council-
men have imposed a municipal
sales tax on Philadelphia. He be-
lieves that only 2 per cent of the
population are ﬁt to govern and

that he belongs to that 2 per cent. -

Tariff Expert Explains
Departmental Methods 3

Explaining in detail the work-9

ings of the present tariﬁ plan as
embodied in the Trade Agreements
Act of June 12, 1934, Dr. Wallace
McClure, chief assistant of the
treaty division of the U. S. De-
partment of State, addressed the
ﬁnal meeting of the Social Science
Seminar Friday. .

Dr. McClure cited the new sys-
tem, which has been extended
past its original three-year dura-
tion, as a “signiﬁcant example of
how the functioning of democratic
government can be made more
ﬂexible and efﬁcient.”

FIXING OF RATES

In explanation he revealed how
civil service experts of the vari-
ous departments ﬁx the precise
tariff rates, under the direction of
the President, “the one popularly
elected representative of the whole
national electorate.”

Dr. McClure pointed out that it
would be poor practice to allow
statesman, whose duty it is to
formulate large policies, to waste

their time over details like indi-
vidual tariff rates, concerning
which they have little knowledge.
“Action in ignorance is not, unless
by sheer accident, an expression
of popular rule.”
HEARINGS PROCEDURE

In responding to questions from
the group, Dr. McClure discussed
the procedure of the public hear-
ings held before the treaty divi-
sion, telling how spokesmen of
many industrial interests appear
in behalf of their business. -.

Prior to the address, Dr. Alfred]
P. James, professor of history, as
chairman of the nominating com-
mittee, announced selections for
oiﬁcers of the Seminar for next
year. The appointments , . were:
president, Dr. John H.'McFadden,
assistant professor of psychology;
secretary-treasurer, Dr. David K.
Bruner, assistant professor of so-
cial workr; program chairman,
Russel A. Dixon, assistant profes-

sor of economics.

Varies Slightly

Business inthef Pittsburgh dis-
trict continues at a steady pace,
with little noticeable ﬁuctuation,
the Bureau of Business Research
revealed today. Culminating in a
minutely gradual downcurve, this
week’s business index stood at
61.7 per cent of the 1923-25 aver-
age.

Though the volume of freight
shipments inithe city decreased,
this loss was almost equally com-
pensated for in the slight rise of
production and trade. Steel ac-
tivity remained about the same as
the preceding week, while coal
production and electric power pro-
duction fell moderately.

Of Season

By NORMAN GIBSON

American artists from Benjamin

partment of ﬁne,,_arts, seventh
ﬂoor, Cathedral.

.. The 35 drawings, giving a view
of American talent and draftsman-
ship, are from the collection of
John Davis Hatch, Jr., and are
circulated by the American Fed-
eration of Arts.

For the most party, the draw-

ings are studies and practice ex-
ercises done by the artists. Some
of them were designed to be used
as illustrations for reproduction,
as themes for etchings, and others
as studies for paintings.
L Several are really trials or mod-
els for more extensive work,
rather than being complete in
themselves, but this gives them
special signiﬁcance, for they illus-
trate how the artist thinks and
works.

Players Plan
Final Banquet
To Honor Cass

Pitt Players, University dra-
matic group, will hold their ﬁnal
banquet of the year Thursday eve-
ning at 7:30 o’clock in the Grey-
stone Manor on Ellsworth avenue,

On the program for the banquet
will be the election of officers for
1938-39. Keys and other honors

meritorious work with the Players.

Carl B. Cass, assistant professor
of English and director of Pitt
Players, will be guest of honor at
'I‘hursday’s banquet. Mr. Cass has
announced his resignation from
the University faculty. He leaves
in June to accept a position at the
University of Wisconsin and to
complete work for nis doctorate
degree.

A program has been planned for

Elects Head

Smith Announces
Cabinet Plans
For Coming Year

William R. ‘Smith, CE39, was
elected president of the Engi-
neering Association at the ﬁrst
meeting of the association ’s
new cabinet last Thursday.

Members of the cabinet had
been selected that morning at
the seminar meetings of the
six departments of the School of
Engineering.

Other ofﬁcers of the 12-man
cabinet are John Merrick, IE40,
vice-president; Paul Gibson, AE40,
secretary; and Robert Schmalz,
IE39, treasurer.

PERSONNEL LISTED

The following is the complete
personnel of the junior and senior
representatives from the six de-
partments on the cabinet: civil en-
gineering: William R. Smith, sen-
ior, and Fred W. Jones, junior;
mechanical engineering: John G.
Rohrman, senior, and Thomas J.
Morgan, junior; aeronautical en-
gineering: Michael Valerino, sen-
ior, and Paul Gibson, junior; elec-
trical engineering: Ralph Berge-
man, senior, and Donald Dornen-
berg, junior; chemical engineering:
Thomas Dickson, senior, and Wil-
liam Rusnak, junior; industrial
engineering: Robert Schmalz, sen-
ior, and John Merrick, junior.

Asked about his program for the

coming year, president-elect Smith
announced that several innova-
tions in policy would be made, all
of them designed to make the En-
gineering Association more valua-
ble to students in the Engineering
school, and to make the Engineer-
ing Association more of a power
on the campus.

MEETINGS PLANNED

According to Smith, there will
be a series of meetings for all en-—
gineering students. These meet-
ings will be substituted for the
regular meetings which are held“
by individual departments each-«
Thursday morning.

Another plan for the coming‘
year is a “social fee.” Instead of.‘
paying for admission to engineer-
ing dances, smokers, and other so-
cial aifairs, engineering students

~ will pay a small fee at registration
. each semester, which will entitle

them to membership in the Engi-
neering Association and free ad-
mission to all social activities
sponsored by the Association.

The industrial department also
elected last Thursday the ofﬁcers
of their seminar for the coming
year. They are Lee Campbell,
IE39, president; Al I-Iolbrook,
IE41, secretary; and Robert Baker,
IE39, treasurer.

Social Consciousness,
Lunch Don’t Mix

ODAY’S PITT NEVVS lists the atteiidance
record of all Yl\I-YWCA affairs and proj-
ects for the past year.
Attendance has jumped, according to ﬁgures
released by IVilliam WI. Mezitleiiliall, from 45,-
225, the total of 198 -37, to 51,63‘-3 persons.

It is encoura.ging to note this increase. Y
activities have not always been given the prom-
inence they deserve on this campus.

B111: there is something discouraging to note
in the report. Speciﬁcally, attendance at func-
tions dealing with world problems and social
questions dropped sharply. Fewer people at-
tended Inquiry Forum, perhaps the only or-
ganization at the University that brings recog-
nized authorities to the campus to speak on
topics dealing with “community and world
citizenship. ”

It seems to be the old story. Students enjoy
classes where there is the comfortable feel of a.
textbook and the assuring drone of an instruc-
tor. They are quite willing to discuss the plight
of Ethiopia. and whether accounts of \Vestern
Pennsylvania coal fields are authentic or not.

But there are tremendous limitations that
block the student. attending meetings of this
sort outside of class. For example, Inquiry
Forum is held during the ﬁfth hour. There is
competition between lunch and the problem of
the Southern sharecropper. Southern share-
croppers are remote; the problem of lunch is
imminent.

Of course, it miglit. be possible to attend some
of the same sort of forums during the after-
noon, and the Y offers many of them. But
there are dance coinmittee meetingsto attend,
and the fraternity house has to balance the
budget again. Consequently, since the student
cannot attend two worthwhile functions at the
same time, some of the Y affairs are sparsely
attended.

Our congratulations go to the students who
attend meetings where a working religion is
discussed or where plans are made for Fresh-
man Camp, still the biggest thing in an incom-
ing freshman ’s year.

But our respect and admiration goes to those
students who find the time to hear tariff ex-
perts and labor authorities aiitl government
theorists. Many of these same people do gratis
work among the settlement houses and under-
privileged homes of Pittsburgh.

They get little recognition for it. They do
not get activities’ points or appointinentis
through it. But they are a powerful balance
offsetting the dances, concerts, and bul ses-
sions that represent the other half of a Uni-
versity, and by achieving this balance, they
help to make the University an outpost of cul-
ture, with all the implications that the word
implies.

Prime Evil No. 4

T IS SOMEVVHAT possible for a man to be
genuinely important on Dartmouth ’s cani-
pus and still be a B. M. O. C. But the typical
B. M. O. C. is rather a campus drawback, be-
cause he deliberately sets himself to be a B. M.
O. C. and nothing else.

Our protagonist wants to achieve recognition
and nothing else. He is a dilettante in activi-
ties, he agrees with everybody and leads no-
body in controversial issues, and in behavior he
is a perfect Tom Swift——following all the tenets
of Clean Living himself, pleasantly tolerant of
all the popular deviations from Clean Living
on the part of others, and nobly, just a little
piously, disapproving of such departures from
the path of right as are generally regarded as
foolish.

He achieves his goal of Recognition for Noth-
ing through two unfailing habits——popularity
and regularity. He is careful to gather a wide
acquaintance; and equally careful to preserve
it by being an unfailing Greeter. He says
“hello” to everybody very pleasantly, at all
times; and he makes sure that he makes all
friends and no enemies by conversing always
on pleasant and utterly insigniﬁcant topics. He
can agree with each of two men that the other
is all oﬁ-side, and be a pleasant acquaintance
to both of them.

On the score of regularity, he is best ﬁtted
for B. M. O. C.-ism if he can be sufficiently

good not to arouse contempt and still sufﬁcient- .

ly average not to arouse anybody’s resent-
ment.

He dresses always well enough to be “Well-
dressed” but not so well as to be glaringly
“smooth.” He studies hard enough to be
respectable but not enough to be a grind. He
works hard enough in his activities to be
classed as “active” but never hard enough or
absorbedly enough to be thought of as “one-

sided” or “whacky.” He seldom disagrees

with the minority.

He never really does anything important be-
cause any important step will arouse some op-
position; opposition frightens him; all the B.
M. O. C. wants is to be liked by everybody.

The tragedy of the B. M. O. C. is not in him-
self, for he will always be a pleasant, innocu-
ous fellow; rather it is in the fact that the cam-
pus operates on so trivial a scale of values as
to repeatiedly entrust its highest oiﬁces and re-
sponsibilities to friendly nonentities of his
type. Hence, student enterprise and achieve-
ment never materialize because the posts of
leadership are held by men too friendly, too
regular to lead.—The Dartmouth.

Snowed Out

An item that has just come to our attention from
Iowa State College concerns their varsity baseball
team. During the spring vacation the team had
spring weather and got in a lot of practice sessions
but about a month ago, the season opening was de-
layed nearly a week because of snow on the play-
ing ﬁeld.

Graduate Engineers

Five years from now engineering students grad-
uating this year from Columbia University expect
to be earning $3,900 annually, according to results
of interviews obtained by the placement bureau at
Columbia.

Honor System

Student Council members at the University of
Akron will take ﬁnal action today on creating a stu-
dent “cheating jury” to cope with examination
cheating. It is planned to replace a committee of
faculty members now used and would include a
minority representation of teachers.

What appears to be the most drastic regulation
the students want imposed on themselves is the
plan to drop from the University any student found
guilty of a second offense of cheating.

Here And There:

Pitt is the only school in the world with a sky-
scraper school building, the only school with John
Downie as SFA president and the only school with
a real, live Prince of Pilsener, alias Joe McCor-
. Just ask Joe to put on his monocle for
you and you’ll see the resemblance . . .(some wit
might comment that this resemblance comes from
much imbibing of the brew).

Paul Kohberger leaves for Europe this week but
don’t fret gals, he’ll be back next year if some lark-
eyed French lass doesn’t pick him off . . Bud
Furtwangler, the lad who has visited all the schools
and approves of none, forget to dodge the ball and
so has his face in a sling . . .

Around The Town:

Debonair Walt Evans is giving Pete Gimber a
run for his money with lone Williams . . The
Grennan family has gone romantic with Tykie
spending her time with “Torchy” Paden and
“Lefty,” the human dynamo, beating Herb Stoeck-
lein’s time with Dottie Culp.

Love is in the air with Sam Smuckler blazing the
trail to Mars every week-end . . Nancy Walker
and Chick Wassel smiling prettily at each other

. and Bob Lowe and Lorene Kessler being on
the verge . . . (do I hear an “of what?”).

Clint Sipe and Dottie Risdale are deﬁnitely, oh
but deﬁnitely, on the outs . . Leo Griffith, alias
the “Wolf,” didn’t want Dottie to be lonesome so
he saved the situation by taking her out himself
last Friday . . . Jane Spencer is studying law these

days under the tutelage of a young law student.

l Young Violinist Wants
}To Study In Europe

Betty Jane Atkinson, Pittsburgh Symphony

f Member, Likes Ping Pong, Swing Music

Child prodigy or no child prodi-9

gy, there is enough “average
American” girl in Betty Jane At-
kinson to make her want to be in
the movies.

Betty Jane is the sixteen—year-
old violinist from the Pittsburgh
Symphony orchestra who ap-
peared as guest artist at the
Women’s Choral concert Wednes-
day evening.

She would like very much, she

says, to appear in a movie as a
soloist, but not just as a member
of an orchestra. And another
thing she would like to do is con-
duct a symphony orchestra.
3 Tall, blond, and very pretty,
lBetty Jane is still a high school
{student at Winchester Thurston
‘ school. She has not yet made any
deﬁnite plans for the future with
the exception of deciding that she
wants to continue studying mu-
sic. ‘

As it is with most musicians, it
seems to be one of Betty Jane’s
ambitions to study in Europe. If
it is possible, she said, she would
like to study in Paris. As yet
she has never been to Europe.

As far as she is concerned there

 

is nothing else she has ever want-
ed to do or take up except mu-
sic. “I would never want to be a
school teacher or anything like
that,” she said. '

Although Betty Jane has studied
classical music all her life, and
probably played it to the exclu-
sion of jazz, she does not scorn
the modern dance music of today.

For like almost all girls her
age, she loves to dance, and even
has her favorite dance bands.
Benny Goodman rates first in her
list of favorite bands, with Hor-
ace Heidt and Wayne King run-
ning close behind.

She said of jazz, “I guess I like
it as well as anybody, but not
when it gets too hot.”

Betty Jane does not get all her
exercise from the difficult num-
bers she plays on the violin either.
Far from it. She is a very active
girl whose favorite sports are
swimming, tennis, and ping pong.

As for her immediate future,
Betty Jane will be playing With
the Pittsburgh symphony orches-
tra again this fall, a work which
she likes very much.

Student Dance
Orchestras Sign
On Board Liners

Two more student dance orches-
tras have been chosen to play for
ocean liners sailing between the
United States, England, and France
this summer. The orchestras are
headed by Andy Cox, C39, and
Bob Brown, C39.

Cox’s outﬁt will leave for Eng-
land on August 20, sailing on the
Georgie. After a two Weeks
stopover, the group will return to
American on the Aquitania. Both
of the boats are White Star lin-
ers.

Instrumentalists in this orches-
tra includes Cox; his brother, Jer-
ry Cox, Duke ’39; Harold Broudy,
BA39; Lloyd Filer, BA41; and Mel
Goldstrohm, E39.

Bob Brown’s orchestra will
leave New York on June 22, and
will land in Cherbourg, France.

‘After an eight day stopover, they

will return to New York. They
will play for their keep both ways
on the S. S. Roosevelt

Members of Brown’s orchestra
includes Austin Hay, C38; Bob
Cook, C38; Jack Richards, C40;
Jack Eckhardt, and Brown.

The orchestras are required to
play approximately three hours
per day on board. Owing to for-
eign union rpgiilation, they are
required to leave their instru-
ments on board ship.

The orchestras were booked by
Philip Boone, representative of the
steamship companies.

STANLEY

I know it’s really none of my

business, but have you ever run
around in the rain with your bare
feet hanging out? (That’s a ridic-
ulous question to be asking you at
this time of year, but after all,
aren’t we all?) What I mean to
say is, haven’t you ever felt like
running around in the rain? Bare-
 foot of course.
 Well neither did Irene Dunne.
{She never did. Not once. Not un-
til Douglas Fairbanks Jr. got
around to her in “Joy of Living.”
But once she started . . they
made a picture about it, one of
those slappy comedies.

Most of the slaps were directed
at Irene’s family. Irene, you
should know, for the purposes of
the picture is a famous Broadway
star with a heart as big as Min-
nie’s. She spends all the money
on her family, a group of leeches
with not a conscience amongst‘;
them.

They, the pater and mater and
all the little chiselers, had their
hands open nearly all the time and
it was costing Irene some ten
grand a week to keep them, which
is a pretty penny as pennies go.
Not only that, not only were they
living in a style to which they were
just getting accustomed, but they
weren’t even thankful. They were
ingrates, all of them, every last
one, even the mother, a fact I am
sorry to report coming, as it does,
practically on the heels of Moth-
ers’ Day.

If Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., who
has just come back from England
and makes a wonderful substitute
for Ronald Colman, hadn’t shown
up Irene would be broke today
with not enough money to pay her,

income tax. It was Douglas who
saved the revenue for the Inter-
nal Revenue Department by show-
ing Irene a good time on two
bucks.

True, it was sometime before
Doug made Irene realize that her
family was strictly no good, but
he did. Doug was not the sort of
man who would give up on some-
thing like that. He got what he
wanted and took her to Paradise,
an island on the Paciﬁc which he
owned.

Any of you who do see the stage
show may be puzzled as I was by
the mystery of Guy Lombardo.
How does he get away with it?
Year after year he keeps dishing
out the same drool. For all I
know he may even be wearing the
identical shirt he wore on the
Stanley stage two years ago. At
least it looked the same. And his
music was just as monotonous as
ever. The redeeming feature on
the stage, however, were the Cal-
gary Bros. who stage a clever
dance and comedy act.

FULTON

Two double-bills you may not
be crazy about. The one stars
Lew Ayres in “King of the News-
boys,” a story of much social sig-
niﬁcance and as little entertain-
ment value. .

The other picture is an English
importation with Jessie Matthews
and Roland Young. ’Roland is, as
ever, good. Jessie is a beautiful
piece of stuff. The English ought
to put her in a good musical.

WARNER
“Test Pilot” is still here.

PENN
Still on the corner of Sixth and

Manager Scott Predicts Big
Things For Scotts

, By Leonard Levison
Sports Editor

 

“Don’t forget,” eifervesced Manager Frank Scott in his
usual effervescent manner the other day, “that the most crucial
game in the baseball league is going to be played Monday
afternoon. ”

There was not even a skimper of doubt’ that Manager Scott
was talking about the Scotts, sometimes known as the Scott
Emulsions and even by various other Scott trade-names. The
Scotts are one of the undefeated baseball teams in the intra-
mural play and other critics than¢

fearful of a monopoly

Manager Scott have not hesi-
tated to proclaim their merit, al-
though Manager Scott is not tight-
lipped himself.

Equipment Dispenser

Scotty has been managing quite
well these past few days. As a
junior manager under A1 Barr last
October and November he man-
aged the Panthers into the posi-
tion of the foremost football pow-
er in. he nation, quite a creditable
performance. This spring he step-
ped into the newly—created post of
gridiron manager of equipment at
the same time Bill McBride was
given the varsity managership.

=K= * :1:

And now he is managing the
most formidable diamond outﬁt to
swing a bat in the intramural
tournament. Of course, he is not
exactly a Bill Terry, as some of
his managerial performances will
attest, but the Scotts are more
than satisﬁed. It should also be
remembered that his team is cud-
dling the top rank position in the
league which is no more than can
be asked from any big-time man-
ager.

Not only being the manager,
Scott is also the president, organ-
izer, and name-bestower of the
Scotts. His acumen in recruiting
a team should not be overlooked.
With a motto something to the ef-
fect that what’s good enough for
Jock is good enough for me, he
stood behind his cage in the dress-
ing room at the Stadium and as
the huskies checked in their equip-
ment, he signed them up as base-
ball color-bearers for the Scotts.

As a result Michelosen, Chick-
erneo, Kish, Hensley, and company
instead of playing for the Dith-
ridge Street Aristoerats joined the
‘farm system of Branch Rickey
Scott.

Scott-Olson
Clash Diamond

Feature Today

With the elimination of three
clubs and the possible elimina-
tion of several more, the Intra-

Mural Baseball League today
swings into its third week.

The Pitt Players, the Phys. Ed.
Juniors, and the Bus. Ad. boys
have all been dropped, since none
of them have shown up for any
scheduled games. As was an-
nounced earlier, the two fresh-

man Service teams have been
combined.
PHI KAPS PLAY
The bird-hitting Phi Kappa

outfit, featuring Urban, Cambal,
and Goodell meets the Phys. Ed.
Sophomores on the football prac-
tice field at 3:30 this afternoon.
Both teams are undefeated, and
the Sophs hold the league lead.

Led by Alexis and West, the
Pre—Dents are heavy favorites to
stop the Chem. Specials in the
second game up on the hill.

The Dents and the Rover Boys
play the 5 o’clock game at the
Stadium. A If Holt pitches for the
Rovers, they should win; without
Holt, they are just a bunch of
good clean kids out for some fun.

The highlight of the evening,
if not of the entire season, is the
Scott-Olsens conflict at 6:30.

Tomorrow, the Phi Kaps have
another tough opponent in the
Frosh Footballers. The game is
set for 3:30 on the football prac-
tice ﬁeld.

SEALS VS. SCOTTS

The 5 Stadium game between
the Chem Seniors and the Cath-
edrals will probably not be
played, since the Cathedrals have
yet to appear for a game.

At 6:30 on the Stadium field,
the Scotts play their second con-
secutive stiff match, When they
meet the Seals, who have lost
only one game, a 2-1 upset.

Wednesday, the Phys. Ed.
Frosh play the Engineers in the
3:30 game on the hill, with the
Chem Sophs-Chem Frosh frolic
following.

Kappa Alpha Phi faces the Fac-
ulty at 5:00 in the Stadium. At
6:30 the Chem Specials finally get
into their own class against the
Diablos.

, him.

But,
charge, Scott didn’t corner the
football market and some of the
more talented gridders were left
free to be grabbed up by that
other astute organizer, Gene Pow-
ers, who quaintly dubbed his
outﬁt the Olson Swedes as his
manner of recording the 1938
Penn Relays in University history.

=14 >3: =l=

Powers has a similarly sturdy
organization and his boys, thanks
to versatile Ed Spotovich on the
mound, are in just as secure a
position as the Scotts. But, today
that calm will be disturbed. The
Scotts and the Olson Swedes will
do battle.

Kish Pitches

Scott can see nothing but vic-
tory for the Scotts. His chief
strategical contribution will be
the selection of Ben Kish to do
the hurling today. Kish is one
of the two Scott pitchers, but Kish
is also one of the league’s best.
Trained in American Legion com-
petition with the Tonawanda post
aggregation, Kish has indicated
that he is material for next year’s
varsity. ‘

Scott is a very much on-his-
toes manager and is constantly on
the look-out for new material to
improve his team. Dick Bartell,
who does a bit of short—stopping
for the Giants, was up at the foot-
ball clinic l.ast week-end and Scott
wasted no time propositioning
((Judge Landis take note.)
His only worry was what to do
with Chickerneo in case Bartell
accepted his offer.

=l< 91¢

Everything should go alright for
the Scotts today if Manager Scott
remembers not to steal second
base when Don Hensley is already
there as he has already done this
year.

By SAM ROSENBERG
If you only looked at his sun-
tan, you’d know that Jack
Schricker was spending all of
his time with the intramural
baseballers. But, when you ex-
amine his background you ﬁnd
one very good reason for the
Pitt boxing coach’s intense inter-
est in the Pitt diamohd program.
Jack’s ﬁrst toy was a baseball

and this was‘ natural because his 

uncle, Otto Jordon of the Brook-
lyn Dodgers (1901-3), gave it to
him. Another uncle, George Jor-
don, played in the Canadian
League and for the Memphis team
in the Southern Association.
Jack started his

city. He began as a second base-
man and then alternated catching
and pitching. Some of the teams
he played with are the Snee Ath-
letic club, Brentwood, and the
Colliers.

At Carrick high he was the only
man ever to play varsity baseball
while in the eighth and ninth
grades, thus giving him ﬁve years
of high school experience. Two
of the ﬁve years he captained the
Carrick boys. “The biggest thrill
I got out of high school baseball,”
‘he stated, "‘was the pitching of a
no-hit game against Allegheny
high.”

Then Jack came to Pitt and for-
got spikes and bats while he was
busy winning Intercollegiate Box-
ing championships. In 1934 after
graduating from the University,
a Pittsburgh Pirate scout spotted
him and took him over to practice
with the Pirates.

In 1935 Pie Traynor asked him
to catch Mace Brown in an exhi-
bition game at Portsmouth, Ohio.
The ﬁrst time at bat he slammed
one over the left ﬁeld fence for a
homer. “When I saw that ball
sailing over the fence I had my
greatest thrill in baseball,” quoted
the “Big Leaguer.” . .- .

The city playgrounds took on
baseball in 1936 and the supervi-
sion fell to Schricker. His own
team, Phillips and Carrick, Won
the city playground championship
last summer.

This year he has been a domi-
nant ﬁgure in University baseball.
Besides being the captain of the

kground

  

p own career A_
playing with sandlot teams in the IV

faculty nine he teaches the funda-
mentals of the game in his regular
physical education classes, and is
in charge of all equipment on the
new stadium diamond.

When asked what his baseball
plans for the rest of this season
were he stated, “I’ll be down at
Forbes Field practicing with the

Buccos learning a few new tricks.” ,

Princeton Sends Pitt Into Rough

This Year, 5-4

Weakness in the lower end of
the golfing order, prevalent all
season, knocked the Pitt golf
team off its undefeated perch and
tumbled it out of first place in
the Southern division of the East-
ern Intercollegiate Golf Confer-
ence as Princeton defeated the
Panthers, 5-4, in a match at
Princeton on Friday.

Undeniable strength among the
first three men could not be sti-
fled. Frank Souchak, Tony Kaye,
and Barrett Melvin, unbeaten in
team play this season, remained
that way as each won his match.

Melvin was strong enough to
carry his partner, Bill Daddio,
through to a best ball point even
though Daddio lost his individual
match to Jack Busby of the Ti-
gers, 3 and 2.

! at the University of Bristol,
;Bristol, England, will teach a
3 special course in the physics of
{metals in the University sum-
imer session from July 5 through
August 12, Dr. Elmer Hutchisson,
‘head of the physics department,
l announced today.
3 Assisting" Mr. Mott will be
!America’s four outstanding scien-
itists in this ﬁeld: Dr. Seitz of the
General Electric company, Schen-
ectady; Dr. John Bardeen, Harv-
ard university; Dr. F. Bitter, Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology;
and Dr. Foster C. Nix, Bell Tele-
phone laboratories, New York.

Dr. Mott and the four American
physicists have been working on
such projects in the highly spe-
cialized ﬁeld of theoretical physics.
This summer, Dr.‘ Hutchisson says.
these ﬁve experts will be brought
together with practical metallurg-
ists and engineers from industrial

laboratories of Pittsburgh and
Western Pennsylvania.
“It is hoped,” Dr. Hutchisson

adds, “that the union of these two
groups will bring about much
progress in the development of
metals.”

The course of lectures includes:
“Fundamentals of Metallic Struc-
ture,” by Dr. Mott; “Special Topics
in the Physics of Metals,” Dr. Mott;
“Elementary Quantum Mechanics
of Solids,” Dr. Seitz; “Atomic Ar-
rangements in Alloys,” Dr. Bitter;
“Electrical Conduction in Solids,”
Dr. Bardeen; and “Order and Dis-
order in Alloys,” Dr. Nix.

As far as possible, Dr. Hutchis-
! son adds, the lectures will be

scheduled during the late after-
non hours to permit full par-
ticipation by those in industry.
Formal lectures will be given
Mondays through Thursdays, with
discussion meetings on special top-
ics scheduled for Friday after-
noons.
