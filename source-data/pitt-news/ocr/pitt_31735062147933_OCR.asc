.V LECTURE Rooms,

With reasonable efliort, 'in-structors
"and students co-operating, lecture-
rooms may be made more attractive
than they usually are. Alumni’ Hall
(for example) contains ﬁne lecture-
rooms whose walls may -be hung ‘with
maps, charts, drawings, pictures,‘
fac-si-mile-s, and other relevant mate-
rial thus takinvgaway the “bare” look
so commonly oppressive in college lec-
‘ ture-rooms. A
1 Doubtless instructors‘ possess mate-
rial which they might .thVus.contribute
and ‘classesare usually willing, (as
all are able) to co-operate by "causing
’|such material to be put in proper
form for perrnant-nt display. Thus
maps,» pictures, fac-similes, letters,
etc., etc.,“may be framed and hung
km the walls of these rooms, to the
cheerier appeaﬁince of the same.

Lecture-room No. 208 has begun
the good work--there having been
hung on its walls several rare repro-
ductions (“Magna Carta,” “Declara-
tiorf of Independence,” a facsimile of
the Constitution of the United States,
with.attac_VlV1Ved seal of the Department)
of State, a rare French map of North
hkmerica dated 1703) all placed with

Ed., '21. M. A. Nernberg, Ed., 21,
head engrosser of Duff’s College,
has recently qualiﬁed to act as a
hand writing expert in court. His
expert testimony carried full weight
by the court in rendering the ﬁnal
decision in the Elizabeth Haines
Estate. Mr. Nemberg, at the re-
quest of the We.stinghousse Electric
and Manufacturing Company offi-
cials ‘gave a talk over the radio,
April 22 on the subject “Detecting
Forgery in Signatures.” He is a
member of the Tau Delta Theta
fratemity, University Aviation
Club, and is publicity chairman of
the College Men’s Club. His
studio is located at 309 Morowood

l‘

After being trimmed by Yale, the
‘baseball team traveled to Medford,
Mass, last v,§;l‘hursd«a to oppose Tufts
College in the sec§1d game of the
Eastern trip. Our fate was similar

to the one we suffered in New Haven, 3

for Tufts defeated us, 10-1.»

The ability of the Tufts batters to
-hit our ptitcher‘, Bloom, and the in-
ability of our batters to -hit Morrell,
explains this overwhelming defeat.
So weak was our offense that we
failed to get more than one safe hit
in any one inning. " Only an error
after Tom.Davies had doubled in the
fourth inning and had been sacriﬁced
to third by Barber gave-us our lone
run. . -

In spite of the poor showing’ our
representatives -made a good impres-
sion. _ The double plays engineered
(by -us‘ drew -much applause fromkthe
spectators. Gahles caught the finest
game of his career. He was also the
best Panther batter of the, day.

EN you go after your first big commission,-you’ll
need something more than a knowledge of stresses
and strains, periods and piping. You’ll need the atmosphere
of success, and the air of knowing your way ’round. One

evidence of thisxfamiliarity with the world’s good things is
the habit of preferring that citizen of the world----

Perhaps others, at that time, also knew these V

two facts, but  so, apparently they knew tliemi

them in cmnbination and the result was the
