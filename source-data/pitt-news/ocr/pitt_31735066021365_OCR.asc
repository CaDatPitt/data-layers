Delivery of funds for Chinese aid proves tobe difficult

By Lou Grieco
News Editor

Efforts to raise money for the victims of
the Chinese government’s massacre of
protesters have brought $820, donated by
Pitt students, to a fund started by the
Chinese Students and Scholars Friendship
Association at the university.

“We appreciate the cooperation of the
administration of the university in the
whole process of the exhibition [in the
William Pitt Union last weekl,” said a
member of the Hong Kong Student Asso-
ciation who asked to remain anonymous.
“We organized it in three days. That’s a
short time. ,

“The Americans have been very suppor-
tive. They expressed condolences and
support and are very attentive to what

happened.”

He said that he could not give the
specific amount in the fund, except for the
money raised at the exhibitions, but that
other contributions had raised the total to
“at least $2,000.”

According to Xiao Min Xu, a member of
the CSSFA and the organizer of the fund,
the next step is to find a way to get the
money to China without the government
getting it. He also said he could not give
an exact amount of money in the fund.

“We are in a difficult position trying to
send the money,” Xu said. "We have to
find a channel. We don’t want to send it
through anyone who is connected‘ to the
Chinese officials.”

Xu also said that the money was put into
a fund controlled by the Brother’s Brother
Foundation, an organization that raises

money for people of other countries, so
that it will not be taxed.

The member of the Hong Kong Student
Association said that the students, mem-
bers of HKSA, CSSFA and other Chinese
organizations, wanted the exhibition to
focus on the behavior of the government.

“There are different points of view among
the [Chinese students at Pittl,” he said. “We
wanted to condemn the government’s act
of killing people using peaceful means of
protest instead of focusing on a political
view.

“We have the same sense of humanity.”

The student said that he was originally
skeptical of the value of the student
demonstrations because of the “complexi-

ties of the system.” He later became opti-

mistic when both the government and the
students were showing restraint Now he

is angry.
“I am _very outraged by the massacre,”
he said. “If they wanted to stop the pro-

tests, the government could have done ‘

something more mode rate. There are many
ways to deal with this besides killing
people.”

He also noted that students from Tai-
wan and Hong Kong as well as mainland
China participated in the exhibition.

“lThe situation in China] is a very‘ impor-
tant concern to us, because we feel very
strong cultural ties with China. We identify
ourselves as Chinese." V

There are. other reasons for concern.

Though the students in the HKSA don’t A

live in mainland China, there is a good

chance they will eventually be a part of it.

Soviet vessel with 900 aboard rams iceberg 

SVALBARD, Norway (AP) —
A Soviet passenger vessel with
more than 900 people aboard
rammed an iceberg in the Nor-
wegian Sea and began listing
early yesterday, reports said.
The Maxim Gorky radioed
north Norway's rescue central, at
12:27 a.m., that it hit an iceberg
about 185 miles west of the
Norwegian Island of Spitsber-
gen, according to the Norwegian
news agency, NIB.
Some passengers, many of
them elderly West Germans,
climbed onto thick ioe ﬂoes and

were being picked up by the

Norwegian vessel Senja, which
arrived about four hours after the
distress signal, NIB said.

Other people among the es-
timated 958 passengers and crew
aboard the 629—foot vessel,
boarded lifeboats and rafts low-
ered from the damaged ship into
the near—freezing water, the re-
ports said.

There were no immediate
reports on casualties.

Z}

NIB quoted the Norwegian
Defense Command as saying
several other Norwegian and
Soviet vessels were within 300
miles of the Maxim Goriey and
that the ship's situation appeared
stable. Four to six Norwegian
helicopters were on their way,
according to the report.

AIDS victims call

for more funds

HARRISBURG (AP) — A
group of AIDS patients and‘ vic-
tims’ advocates called yesterday
for a five-fold increase in state
funds for programs aimed at
preventing the spread of the
deadly disease a nd providing help
for its victims.

Kerry Stoncr, executive di-
rector of the Pittsburgh AIDS Task
Force, said the $3 million in state
money earmarked by the Casey
administration for prevention and
education programs is “embar-
rassing and inadequate.”

He said a coalition of AIDS

 

   

victims and supporters would
lobby the Legislature to set aside
$5 million for education and
prevention, and at least $10 mil-
lion for direct services to people
with the disease.

Anna Forbes, representing
Action AIDS of Philadelphia, said
the number of people with AIDS
in Pennsylvania is expected to
grow from 1,105 this June to
17,680 inJune 1996. This figure is
based on the state Health Depart-
ment’s projection that the num-
ber of AIDS cases will double
every 22 months.

Doctors operate to correct woman's curving spine on

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Doctors us-
ing a new surgical technique corrected a
woman’s curving spine on live television
during two hours of surgery Monday night.
The patient, Deborah Arizin, 27, a
sales representative from Haddonfield,
N.J., said she agreed to have the back
surgery_on live television in the hope of
helping others in need of the operation.
“I don't feel invaded at all,” Mrs. Arizin
said before the operation at Pennsylvania
Hospital. “It’s really kind of surprising, but
the focus is the surgery and the new
technique and how it can help other
patients. I agreed in the hope that it would
help other people who are going through
the same thing.” ‘
Programming executives for
WHYY—TV said they wanted to broadcast

' a live operation for its dramatic impact and

educational value. A

Two percent of Americans suffer from
curvature of the spine, or scoliosis. Until
recently, physicians believed the curving
stopped by the end of adolescence. But it
now appears the curvature continues,

Dr. Richard Rothman, founder of the

Dr. Richard Balderston performed the
operation, during which the patient’s spine
was exposed. Stainless steel rods were

and feet.

grafted bone onto the rods to create a
bridge to hold the rods in place. Mrs.
Arizin, 5 feet 9 inches tall before the
operation, is expected to be an inch and
a half taller when she begins walking. The
surgeon said that might be within a day.

Research has led to new techniques
for correcting scoliosis and reducing re-
covery time, according to Balderston.

“It used to be that patients would have

in one or two day‘¥"PFIe93tB.13:l€"to be in a
plaster body cast for as long asa year. Now
it’s very unusual to need a cast.”

Mrs. Arizin’s scoliosis was diagnosed
when she was 15, too old for corrective
back braces. For the last five years, ortho-
pedics have documented her worsening
curvature by X-rays and measurements,
while she noted the worsening pain.

“I was having increased back pain,
and I came to the realization that it's not
going to stabilize,” she said. “So the quicker,
the better.” i

Mrs. Arizin originally scheduled the
surgery for last fall, only to find a few
weeks before the operation that she was
pregnant. A daughter, Austen Elizabeth
was born eight weeks ago. V

“If this is the hardest thing I have to go
through in life, II will be lucky,” she said.

Happy swordsman executioner’ suﬂers
rzo remorse in carrying out Islozrmcjz/rstice

By Aly Mahmood
Associated Press Writer

MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) —Saudi
Arabia's official executioner, a
skilled swordsman who has dis-
patched more than 600 convicted
criminals, says beheading is less
difficult than chopping off the
hands of thieves.

“Frankly, it's easier to chop off
the head since this act means the
end of the story for the criminal,"
Saeed Al-Sayyat, 60, said in an
interview with the Saudi
newspaper Al-Medina.

“Chopping off a hand needs
more courage, since you are
cutting off a part of the body of an
individual who is to survive,” he
said.

The act requires “very skilled
attention to ensure that the sword
does not slip or cut in the wrong
place,” Saeed said in the inter-
view, which was republished by
a Dubai—based English-language
newspaper, the Gulf Times.

His name has an odd ring in

é Arabic: Saeed means “happy” and

Al-Sayyat “swordsman execu-
tioner.” He changed his second
name when he was appointed to
the job more than 35 years ago.

The executioner says that he
doesn’t suffer remorse for his
victims since he is carrying out
Islamic justice as required by the
Koran, the holy book of Islam.

  
   
  
  
 
 
     
   
     

The Koran decrees that convicted
murderers be beheaded and
thieves lose a hand. Saudi au-
thorities last year ruled that drug
smugglers also should be exe-
cuted.

Al-Sayyat started out as a farmer,
but joined the Saudi army at the
age of 20. He said that “watching
executioners” as theybeheaded
criminals publicly after Friday
prayer sessions became his fa-

;-=..<<.-.< <‘-<-=s ;‘ ‘gs.

vorite hobby.

He later applied for the job of
“sayyat” which carried a salary of
$36 a month, plus an additional
$133 “for each head.”

Al-Sayyat said he carried out his
first execution at age 23, behead-
ing three criminals and “earning
1,500 riYa1s” ($399).

“I always look forward to chop-
ping off more heads so that I can
earn more money," he said.

“Over a period-of time it be-
came a very easy sort ofjob  in
fact, I felt it was easy to do an exe-
cution,” he added. "I have
chopped off the heads of more
than 600 criminals and cut off 60,
hands of thieves.”

A1-Sayyat said he first slices off
the upper part of a convict’s shirt
with his sword to expose the
kneeling victim's neck. Then he
uses a single swift stroke that
sends blood gushing and the head
rolling on the sand.

However, he uses a pistol for '

executing women in. order to
avoid having to cut off their cloth-
ing and reveal naked ﬂesh.
Al-Sayyat admits that he often
gets sleepless nights before exe-
cutions “worrying that lmight

, fall.”

But once the beheading is over,
he feels “delighted and satisﬁed”
for having put an end to “what’s

against the law of God.”

“I was very’ happy when 1’ exe-
cuted a drug traffickerf’ Al—Med-.
ma quoted him as saying.

These days, those awaiting.

execution have their eyes cov-
ered by a black blindfold.

That was introduced after A]-

Sayyat “chopped off the head of _ I

_ one convict and it fell directly in

through the Allegheny Cham-
ber of Commerce, according
to program coordinator Ken
Holleran.

The internships are open to
all undergraduate students in
Allegheny County. Applicants
only need interest in the ﬁelds
relating to the speciﬁc intern-
ships, and must be able to
work on the North Side.

Salaries and duties can vary.
Holleran has already placed
two students from the Com-
munity College of Allegheny
County in computer-electronic
positions. A position in sports

. therapy is currently available.

Deadlines for applications
are ﬂexible. Applicants can
arrange to start their intern-
ships during the summer, or

_wait until the fall orfspring
terms.

“Most of the companies want

Internships are available

the positions ﬁlled as soon as
possible, but are willing to
wait,” said Holleran. “lThe
companies] are willing to work
with the students to fill [the
companies’] needs and [the
students’l needs.”

Craft Products Company, the
Allegheny YMCA, Munches
Lunches, the Pittsburgh Chil-
dren’s Museum, and Keller
Office Equipment are among
the 22 companies participat-
ing.

The program was initiated
in January. Holleran is now
contacting the internship of-
fices of all the local colleges,
including the one at Pitt.

Holleran, who is an intern
from Indiana University of
Pennsylvania, sees the pro-
gram as a uniquely beneﬁcial
opportunity for all involved.
“It’s going to work. It’s a win-
win situation with no one
[losing] out on the deal.”

All students interested in

In addition, all other individu-
als arrested by the Pitt police who
required detention were trans-
mitted by the Pittsburgh police to
a city detention facility on the
North Side. However, that policy
too has now changed

According to Pittsburgh Assis-
tant Police Chief Donald Aubre-
cht, an agreement has been
reached between the city police
and Pitt's Public Safety Depart-

Book

ment that will allow the Pitt po-
lice to transport arrestees di-
rectly from Oakland to the city's
North Side lock-up without first
contacting the Pittsburgh police.
However, there is one restriction.

When an individual is picked
up by the Pitt police for drunken-
ness or drunk driving, the arrest-
ing officer must first consult his
supervisor. If the arresting officer
and his supervisor agree that the
individual is intoxicated, the ar-
restee can be transported by Pitt
police to the North Side.

“What this is is a safeguard for

the students,” Aubrccht said. “I
don’t want any bad arrests being
made by officers who might have
it out for akid.”

Aubrecht added that once an
arrestee is an a city jail, the indi-
vidual is under the auspices of
the city police.

Waters said that the Pitt police
will also use city-owned equip-
ment to conduct its breathalyzer
testing. _

Protectionism will not make the United States competitive with Japan

President Bush recently ac-
ceded to the wishes of protec-
tionist legislators. Under the

auspices of last year's trade bill,

Japan’s name appeared on an

executive list of unfair traders.
Although two other countries

 

Japan is the world's worst trading
partner. Thus, in a recent CNN-

Time poll, 76 percent of Ameri-
cans felt thatJapan was a threat to
the U.S. economy, and 61 per-
cent favored some kind of trade
restrictions.

The rising protectionist senti-
ment is not a result of Japan's pre-
eminence as a selfish trade part-
ner. Brazil, India and the Euro-
pean Community (notably
France), all notoriously, and
sometimes ﬂagrantly, protect their

Supreme Court not civil

Last week, the Supreme Court decided to limit the
scope of a 1976 civil rights ruling so that it could no
longer be used to regulate instances of racial harassment
or other instances of on-the-job discrimination. Civil
rights groups have been expressing their outrage vo-
cally: according to The Washington Post, Barry Gold-
stein, an attorney for the NAACP, stated that the ruling
no longer covered “plain, old racial hatred that makes
the employment situation of blacks unbearable." While
the court busies itself splitting the legal hairs of the
specific wording of the overturned decision, Runyon vs.
McCrary, the problem of discrimination and harassment
in the workplace continues. Benjamin Hooks, of the
Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, went on the
record as saying, “This court term has been a disaster for
all those committed to equal employment opportunity.”
With the court’s limitation of the scope of the Runyon
decision, the problem falls into the lap of Congress.
Several congressmen have already announced plans to
draft new legislation that will cover on-the-job discrirni—
nation, but the Supreme Court has set things back, and
it will take time to recover. It is to be hoped that the court
will, in the meantime, be paying more attention to the

concerns and problems faced by minority Americans.

industries. All protect the basic
economic staples: agriculture,
steel and automobiles.

‘And already, more than two
thirds of Japanese imports suffer
some type of restriction, includ-
ing steel and auto quotas. Ronald
Reagan, the saviour of free trade,
imposed more trade restrictions
than the previous six presidents,

including sanctions on the im- '

port of Japanese semiconduc-
tors. America is not the wide-
open market that some claim.

So why the Japan-basl1ing?
Because it is easier than facing
the fact that America is in deep
doo-doo.

Corporations borrow money to
develop new products. The deﬁ-

. cit, combined with a disastrously

low savings rate, dries up money
and makes interest rates prohibi-
tive, reducing economic invest-
ment.

Further, 60 percent of govern-
mental allocations for industrial
research and development go into
defense —— which has little eco-
nomic payoff. And Washington

continues to cut civilian research
and development, especially
NASA’s.

Most new ideas for products,
namely the transistor, the silicon
chip and the superconductor,
have come from civilian labora-
tories.

 

To be sure, America is still No.
1 in research and development,
but because of the deficit, Ameri-
can corporations are having
trouble matching the marketing
skills of the Japanese. American
labs are churning out ideas like
crazy, but those ideas are being
sold to the Japanese market,
because the money that should
be invested in developing new
products from those ideas is now
servicing a trillion-dollar debt.

The current protectionist senti-
ment is dangerous. It steers ‘public

attention away 'from the real
problem and does not promote
U.S. competitiveness.

Protectionism does nothing for
the economy: jobs are lost as
those companies that have pene-
trated the Japanese market lose
their market share when Japan
retaliates. Prices rise, because the
consumer has less choice. And
protected industries have little
incentive to improve their prod-
ucts. What trade restrictions would
protect is the degeneration of the
U.S. economy. In the past, pro-
tectionism has led not to eco-
nomic growth, but to recession
and depression.

Corporations are already start— ‘

ing to wise up: IBM, AT&T, and
M.I.T. announced a Japanese-
style consortiu m to exploit super-
conducting technology.

The administration must also
take the initiative and begina

serious effort to solve the budget I

deficit. Japan should no longer
be blamed forvAmerican financial
and corporate ills.

Leaders die, but Iran will never change...

If you're a normal and some-
what patriotic American, . one
aware of your surroundings and
capable of conceptual thought,
you’ve probably grown to hate
the late Iranian spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
And, as a person living in this
land which Khomeini so quaintly
referred to as the Great Satan,
you probably felt relieved upon
hearing the news of the death of
this man who once held more
than 50 American citizens hos-
tage. However, before you lay
aside any anxieties, let me state
that things could get far worse.

It was the prophet Nostrada-
mus who once predicted the rise
of the Anti-Christ in the Middle
East — a dreadful and crazed
lunatic wearing a turban who
would ignite World War III. Many
believers and scholars of Nos-
tradamus thought Khomeini
would be that person, but he
wasn't. Many speculated that the

«Libyan leader, Moammar Kad—

CoNi>KoN
©l‘?8‘i

 

daﬁ, would be the lunatic, but a
bombing of his neighborhood

, seems to have quieted him, maybe

permanently. So who’s the luna-

. tic?

In the opinions of many, the
new Iranian leader will be the
speaker of the Iranian Parliament
and the commander of the Ira-
nian Armed Forces, Hojatolislam
Hashemi Rafsanjani.

Now, speculation. has -it that
Khomeini’s vacant post of Su-
preme Religious Guide will be
filled by the current president, Ali
Khamenei. .But my concerns

about who will be the actual,

 

lunatic stems from the office of
the new Iranian president, which
will probably be filled by
Rafsanjani.

Many American idealists are
hopeful that, once in power,
Rafsanjani will free U.S. hostages
held captive by Shiite Muslim
groups -«in Lebanon. Rafsanjani
‘has said that‘ he will free the U.S.
hostages, but only if the United
States uses its inﬂuence to free
the three Iranian hostages taken
captive in Lebanon by Christian
militiamen in 1982. That sounds
like a decent deal, a somewhat
reasonable exchange, but the only
problem is that the Iranian hos-
tages are believed to have been
executed many years ago.

Also, Rafsanjani was the Ira-
nian who demanded that five
Americans or five French should
be killed in exchange for every
Palestinian slain in the West Bank.
His rationale for this is quite
simple: he would prefer that an
Israeli be killedinstead, but claims
t.hatAmericans and French should

1 .

die because “Americans and’

French are easier to kill than
Israelis."

Furthermore, Rafsanjani has
stated that the death sentence on
the British author, Salman
Rushdie, will not’ be. lifted.

Currently, Rafsanjani is on his
way to Moscow for talks about

Soviet-Ira nian economic policies. A

It's speculated that while in
Moscow he will seek direct mili-
tary aid from the Soviets (on May
2, Rafsanjani announced that Iran
had previously received indirect
military aid from the Soviet Un-
ionryia: some of thevEastern Bloc
COU-ﬂ[rleS;' Libya, and . North Ko-
rea). . '

The Ayatollah was the religious V
leader of Iran, a separate power .'
from that of the former President, ‘

Bani-Sadr, between which there

i were always power conﬂicts. The

president’s power was basically
undermined by the fundamental-
ist-based Parliament, led by the
Speaker, Rafsanjani. I

The scary part is that the Ira- ‘
nian constitution will be rewrit- .

ten to give the new President,
probably Rafsanjani, much more
executive power than what was

before possible. This was some- '
thing that the Ayatollah decided

before he died.
The 1990s will not only proba-

bly see a very powerful Rafsanjani, _

as the su pre me ruler of this Middle

Eastern nation, but also the.

emergence of nuclear weapons
in Iran (Soviet sources claim that
Iran is currently developing or
already possesses medium-range
missiles). So, hold on folks, there

(‘W

" to

are many more exciting times  I

ahead with Iran. The paradox is
that, believe it‘or’ not, we may

actually have been better off with '

the Ayatollah’s hand on the guil-

lotine as opposed to Rafsanjani’s..; - _ e

Asst. Managing Editor

In Heaven Help Us, Andrew
McCarthy resorted to physical
violence in dealing with an
oppressive instructor. Pink Floyd's
Roger Waters cried, “Teacher,
leave them kids alone!” in The
Wall. In Dead Poets Society, the
premise of an uncompromising
faculty versus headstrong youths
takes a different turn. I

Dead Poets Society is, in fact,
much like a plate of broccoli.
While its taste may not be the
most appealing, it is undoubt-
edly good for you. And in this
regard, Dead Poets is a reality

The year is 1959, and pictur-
esque Welton Academy is begin-

dents and parents are being

cial wash-out... It's ironic that
David Bowie’s hitsong “Changes”

’ came so early in his career.

From the time in 1974 when
Bowie appeared on stage without
orange, spiky hair thereby going
beyond, if not rejecting, his glam-
rock success, he was constantly
taking his audience by surprise.
And given the last six years, the
biggest surprise Bowie could pull

off would be to make a good ‘I

record. _

The fact that TmMacbz'ne is so
good, however, is not the biggest
surprise here. Bowie has done
the opposite of MickJagger, who
left the Stones to excite no one
except the Japanese: he ignored
the name-sake instant success
(that crashed and burned on the
Glass Spider fiasco) and joined a
band. And he didn’t even call it

Nolan (Norman Lloyd) about the
tradition and heritage of the

ments is thewelcoming of new

instructor John Keating, played
by Robin Williams.

Following this orientation, Neil
Perry and Todd Anderson, played
by Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan
Hawke, are introduced to one
another as roommates. In their
room, they are joined by soon—to-
be Society members, including
Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen) and
Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles).

produced Lust For Life and now
pound out on another legend’s
storm-back-to-form.

So what about the record? It
sounds good on paper: a timeless
rock star forms a group, dresses
them up to look like international
bankers, and turns up their vol-
ume to send his last two LPs into
the sea of forgetfulness._ Coming
from a man whose records (in
contrast to Brian Eno’s which
have great ideas but lack staying
power), were risky at their time
and still sound like major clas-
sics, you might be able to guess
the answer. The most heartening
thing about Bowie’s new project
is that he still has an ear for
integrity and great music.

because they were playing the
worst kind of metal. At first listen,

some time, however, TinMacbine
proves a hundred times as risky
and noisy than any of the MTV
metal. What at first seems murky
and complicated, . emerges as
interesting and varied.

John Keating (Robin Williams) inspires his rebellious students

The first day of classes arrives,
and the audience is whisked
through small portions of the
morbid curriculum the students
are subjected to.

English included.

Keating appears and quickly
invites his students to join him
outside the classroom. Here,
Keating introduces the students
to the unique methods of teach-
ing he employs to open their
minds and hearts, not only to
English, but also to the world
around them. '

The boys’ interest in Keating is

compounded when they find his
picture in a former yearbook.
Under his list of accomplishments
are the words Dead Poets Soci-

ety.

Curious and intrigued, these
students, along with fellow Wel-
tonians Cameron, Meeks and Pitts
(Dylan Kussman, Allelon Rug-
gerio, James Waterston) confront
Keating about the Society.

The seven, fascinated by the
concept of the Dead Poets Soci-

.. ety, meet later that night in a cave

to read poetry, original or bor-
rowed, and escape the reins of
the faculty.

It is this aspect of the film that
is most compelling. Director Peter
Weir uses Williams as an inspira-
tion to the boys, forcing them to
look beyond what is just said,
and the Society as a way for the
students to see the beauty of
doing just that. The cave be-
comes a haven for expression, a
solace outside the authoritarian

lessons thestudents are grilled.

"The Purple One" performs Batman soundtrack 

By Michael Goldberg
Rolling Stone Writer

“In a way, Prince is Batman,” says
Jon Peters, co-producer of the
new motion picture Batman.
“He's a very dark character, and
he’s complex and kind of myste-
rious and explosive.” Who bet-
ter, then, to make batmusic than
“His Purpletttgss?” V

Prince’s alburn;Batman.- Motion
Picture Soundtrack is composed
of new music written for or in-
spired by the movie. The nine
tracks include six songs heard in
the movie (“The Future,” “Par-
tyman," “Scandalous,” “Trust,”
“Electric Chair,” and “Vicki Wait-
ing”) and another three (“The
Arms of Orion,” “Lemon Crush,”
and “Batdance") that are not.
Prince’s album is scheduled for
release by Warner Bros. Inc.

with the opening of Batman.
Warner Bros. Inc. will also re-
lease a second album containing
what Danny Elfman, who wrote
the music for Beetlejuice, calls his
“darkly romantic” score for the
new film.

Batman: Motion Picture Sound-

tracle features some of Prince’s
most commercial work in years.
According to one insider, the
pop star was paid more than $1
million in fees and advances to
make the album— a potpourri of
killer rock guitar, raw funk,
memorable pop hooks and
breathtaking vocalsf

“He had an instantaneous affinity
for the character Batman,” says
Prince’s new manager, Albeit

Magnoli, who directed Purple

Rain. “Prince hooked into the
complexity of that character quite
readily.”

How did Prince get the job? Credit
goes tojack Nicholson, who plays
The Joker in Batman, and the
director, Tim Burton, both Prince
fans. Burton blasted Prince tapes
in his car on the way to the studio
during filming last year and even
temporarily placed two older
Prince songs “1999” and “Baby
I’m a Star,” into a rough cut of the
movie. “Thinking of The Joker, I
always listen to Prince music,”
says Burton.

“The Joker wears purple clothes,

great writers but are reluctant to
question what they are reading.
The success and failure of the
students to stand up for them-
selves is a pivotal theme. The
admirable way the movie por-
trays this involves a realistic
approach. It is more than ‘under-
standable that in the face of
expulsion, there are teenagers
who would do just as the admini-
stration says. There are those
who wouldn’t as well, and that is
why the movie is believable.

This film sets itself apart from
many of the students-against-the-
faculty movies by showing that
hitting a headmaster or calling a
teacher an asshole in front of the
class is not the best way to deal
with kinks in the educational
system.

that the other rockers therein
have insisted that David not re-
vise his lyrics, but keep their
immediate anger. Many an ex-
pletive is‘ deleted on the insert
concerning “skin heads beating
on blacks with a baseball bat”
and “scabby hands” of crack
dealers worming the “little bod-
ies" of young addicts. There’s
also a rocked-up version of Len-
non’s “Working Class Hero” that
forsakes the originals bitter acous-
tic irony and explodes in poign-
ant anger.

Aside from other songs about
the fatality of stardom and self-
aggrandizement, the love songs
on the record are as lovely as
they are loud. In “Heaven’s In
Here” and “Amazing,” Bowie’s
declarations of love are too simple
to be clichéd, and on “Prisoner
Of Love,” Bowie’s love (turns to
protective violence against a
malicious world.

So once again Bowie has not
only given the media plenty to
keep them attentive, but also
made a super record that, like all
his others andall great records in
general, takes some time to get
used to. Tin Machine —- the band,
the record, the song — is a ve-
hicle to take you “anywhere,

BigEast All-Stars come home aﬁer defeats

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

The Big East All-Stars completed their

European basketball tour last week by

dropping all three games of a round—robin
tournament held in Zaragoza, Spain. The
Paul Evans-coached All—Stars were 1-5
overall in their cross-seas stint.

“We were all educated on just how
well they play in Europe,” said John’
Sarandrea, Pitt assistant coach. “Everyone
[in the United States] thinks we’re the only
ones who can play basketball, but that’s

not the case. It was a good experience
athletic wise and education wise.”
Sarandrea also pointed out that the
competition in Europe was with paid
professionals and was therefore at a slightly
higher playing level than college compe-
ﬁﬁons
" In the first game of the tournament,
the French National Team beat the Big
East 118-100. The Big East got within four
points in the second half, but couldn't
manage to pull ahead.
The All-Stars were led by Georgetown’s
guard Dwayne Bryant, who scored 23

points. Guard Bryan Edwards of Boston
College added 16. Villanova’s 7-foot-3
center, Tom Gries, ripped down 14 re-
bounds and added 1 5 points. Pitt’s Darelle
Porter continued his solid play scoring 12
points.

In the_ second game of the tourna-

ment, the Big East was matched against.

feated Poland, but lost big this time 101-

and three assists.

Throughout the tour, Porter had to
switch from his regular guard position to
play point guard.

and with defense,” said Sarandrea. “He
rose to the occasion of playing a different
position. Consideringf 7",” - off-season

won the event in the Big~East

the Eastern meet 100 breast

herself to be one of the best in

SWitzer's replacement named

By Doug Ferguson
Associated Press Writer

NORMAN, Okla. (AP)— Gary
Gibbs, a player and then a defen-
sive coordinator under Barry
Switzer, was designated to suc-
ceed Switzer as Oklahoma's head
football coach Tuesday.

Gibbs, winning the recom-
mendation‘.rof§;rthea«school’s in-
terim presidemnand its athletic
director, said he would remove
the cloud that has hovered over
the scandal-plagued football
program by “doing it right."

“We’ve got to remove that
cloud, that uncertainty of what’s
going on down there," Gibbs
said. “We're a bunch of good
guys. All we’ve got to do is the
right thing."

Gibbs’ appointment must be
approved by the university’s
regents, who meet Wednesday.

Switzer quit Monday, after
having coached Oklahoma to
three national championships and
12 Big Eight Conference titles.

Gibbs would be the third
alumnus to hold the job. His only
college experience as a player
and as an assistant coach is at
Oklahoma. Switzer had recom-
mended that his successor come
from the school.

“But I want to tell you that
even if we had conducted a na-
tional search for our new coach
rather than promote from within,
I do not believe we could have
found a better ' person for the
job," said David Swank, the uni-
versity’s interim president. “Gary
Gibbs is one of the outstanding
young coaches in the country.”

The change at the top comes
six weeks before fall practice
begins and just two months be-
fore the Sooners’ Sept 2 opening
game against New Mexico State.

Gibbs fielded questions in-
volving the pressure he would
face in following the winningest
coach in Oklahoma football.

“I’m Gary Gibbs. I knowwhat
I can do,” Gibbs said. “Your
comparison is your comparison.

We're going to go forward and
make this thing happen.”

Gibbs, 38, was chosen over
two other assistant coaches: Merv
Johnson, 53, and Jim Donnan,
34.

“OU has a history of young
coaches rising to the top," Ath-
letic Director Donnie Duncan
said. ‘In the years to come you’ll
understand why I made the rec-'
ommendation to name Gary
Gibbs as head football coach.”

Switzer was 35-Years-old
when he was named head coach
in 1973. Chuck Fairbanks, whom
Switzer succeeded, became head
coach at Oklahoma in 1967 at age
33.

Switzer became head coach
when Oklahoma was serving a
two-year NCAA probation. He
leaves the program in the first
year of a three-year probation,
mostly for recruiting violations.

The program's woes were
compounded, however, when
five players were charged with
felonies.

really bad,” said Sullivan. “After
last year, people know who I am,
and I don’t want them thinking
I’m just a one-time deal.”

Sullivan said she’s going to
take a different approach to
qualifying next year. She’s going
to try to make the cut early in the
season, perhaps an invitational
meet as early as November. Last

, year she didn't taper her work-
, outs for the early meets. Tapering

is a method of cutting back
workout distance in order to be
fresh and rested for the big meets.
This year she’ll taper earlier,
according to Sullivan.

The lack of tapering didn't
hurt her season too much, how-
ever.

“She had a tremendous fresh-
man year,” said Belowich. “I don’t
know how she can top an unde-
feated season. But with the
competitor in her, I’m sure she’ll
do everything to match it. “

The 400 IM event she swam

in three events now, and she has
conﬁdence in all of them. That is
going to help the team a lot next
year"

Sullivan is looking forward
to next year already. She is ex-
cited about the good recruiting
year Pitt had and the proven
junior college transfers coming
to Pitt.

“We are going to have an
incredible team next year. We'll
get our eighth Big East champi-
onship, for sure. As far as Eas-
terns are concerned, I think we'll
give Harvard a run,” said Sulli-
van.

Harvard is one of the per‘en- 
nial powerhouses in Eastern
swimming. Sullivan had several
reasons for choosing Pitt over a
swimming powerhouse. In fact,
the first time she saw Pittsburgh,
she knew she wanted to stay in
the city.

“When "I drove through the-i
Fort Pitt tunnels the first time and
saw the view of Pittsburgh I just
loved it. I said to my mom, ‘I want
to go here, I have a really good
feeling about it.’ “

She also liked Belowich’s
style of coaching.

' “It’s hard to find a coach who

   
 

 
       
   

 
  

is a good stroke coach, because
breast stroke is so up and down,"
said Sullivan. “Dave is a great
coach, I have total faith in every-
thing he says. Sometimes I don’t
like what he says, but I know it’s
going to help me in the long run.”

Karin Masal, another super
breast-stroke swimmer for Pitt
also helped Sullivan with her
decision. Sullivan came in to Pitt
as the No. 2 breast—stro,_,l<,e, swim-
mer, and Masal pushed «Sullivan
to work harder.

“Having Karin there was
probably the best thing for me,"
said Sullivan. “Seeing her every-
day and seeing how fast she was
made me think that there was no
reason thatI couldn't be that fast
It turned out great for the team
also, because she ended up being
a_better at distance events, and I
was better at sprinting.”

Sullivan's swimming success
started at an early age. She was
competing nationally at age 8,

and continued swimming nation—’

ally until her sophomore year in
high school, when she joined her
high school team.

Sullivan went to Olympia
High School in Rochester, N.Y.,
where‘ she was a state champion

in her sophomore year. She holds
three individual Olympia school
records (100 breast stroke and
backstroke and the 200 IM), and
is part of the record medley relay
team.

Sullivan's only regret in
swimming is the lack of respec
the sport gets. ~ _

“I wish swimming got more
recognition. People don’t realize,
how hardéitdspaiﬂicﬁdiat it’s more
than justi7s\ivirnrntI:v§>iback and
forth in a pool. You have to be in
shape all around; y‘ou‘can’t just
specialize in one thing.”
