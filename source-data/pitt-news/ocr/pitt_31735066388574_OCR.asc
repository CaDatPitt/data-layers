Students  
discuss
social

change

By Mindy Boffymeyer

Staff Writer

Pitt students and others
gathered at the ground floor of
the William Pitt Union last night
as part of an organizational meet-
ing of the Pittsburgh Student Net-
work for Creative Social Change.

The Pittsburgh Student Net-
work, formerly the The New Stu-
dent Network, is one of many
localized groups of liberal stu-
dents that are beginning to or-

: ganize on a national level. Their

objective is to mobilize students
to participate actively in the
democratic political process.

It seems as though
many students have
similar political ideolo-
gies 

— Angie Hirsh

One of theissues discussed at
last night's meeting involved the
National Student Convention to
be held Feb. 5, 6 and 7 at Rutgers
University. Students attending the
convention will hear speeches
made by students and national
and international leaders and
vote on a constitution, a tem-
porary organizational committee
and a name .for the national or-
ganization.

“Itseems as though many stu- ‘

dents have similar political ideol-
ogies but they're splintered into
many different groups,” said An-
gie Hirsh, president of The Pitts—
burgh Student Network at Pitt.

In order to bring together all of
these students and their views the
group plans to encourage and
coordinate various non—violent
political activities” and to pro-
vide ”educative forums to benefit
all members of the university
community.”

The Pittsburgh Student Net-
work has recently written a con-
stitution and submitted a copy to
the university. The group wishes
to become supported and recog-
nized officially as a campus or-
ganization. _

Some of the issues that The
Pittsburgh Student Network is
concerned with are military
research on college campuses,
the new Supreme Court decision
to limit student publications,
Contra aid, racism, sexism and
homophobia. \

WASHINGTON — President
Reagan has decided to resume
airdrops of. lethal supplies to

Nicaragua’s Contra rebels and

will seek more money for the in-
surgents in a request to Congress
later this month, his spokesman
said Tuesday.

”This is not the time to falter in
our support for the freedom fight-

ers (the Contras),” said presiden-
tial spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.

He said Reagan would send a
certificationto Congress later in
the day to resume shipments,
which had been held up for the
last week while the five Central
American presidents met in San
Jose, Costa Rica, to evaluate the
progress of their 5-month—o|d
peace agreement. ’

”Most of the doors of the truck stop are drifted up. It's a pret-

Preliminary estimates of damage in Southern California and
Mexico added up to about $65 million from huge waves that
smashed restaurants, beach houses and piers, sheared off part
of a hotel and wrecked boats and cars parked near the beach.

Mary Jane Hoffman, restaurant manager of the Rip Griffin
Truck Stop in Limon, said about 250 people were at the truck
stop Tuesday morning, including two busloads of children from
Kansas City, Kan., returning from a ski trip. She said they slept

Daniel Ortega had offered a num-
ber of concessions at the San Jose
meeting, including direct talks
with the rebels on a cease fire.

”The key ‘issue is whether
Daniel Ortega is really commit-
ted to genuine democracy or just
seeks the elimination of the
‘Nicaraguan democratic resis-
tance,” Fitzwater said. ”The San-
dinistas’ track record is clear and
must beiconsidered in evaluating
the latest Sandinista offer.

Reagan_will spell out nis new

aid request for the Contras at the‘

end of the month after the Jan. '25
State of the Union address. Fitz-

water said the amount and the

composition of the request will

be determined by what Ortega

does between now and then in
fulfilling his promises.

”There is a need for openmind-
edness and hope, along with
skepticism,” Fitzwater said.

Ratings king Jack Bogut to leave WTAE soon

PITTSBURGH —- Jack Bogut,
once the undisputed voice of
morning radio in Pittsburgh, will
leave WTAE radio at or before the
expiration of his contract in mid-
July, a station official said.

”It is clear that there will not be
a contract renewal,” Tom Clen-
dening, the station's program
director, said Monday.

Bogut, 52, ‘a native of Wolf
Point, Mont., was on vacation
and could not be reached for
comment Tuesday. J

"Clendening said WTAE and
Bogut ”have had some discus-
sion” about Bogut leaving the sta-
tion before the end of his
five-year contract.

”He has some outside business
interests and other interests he's
pursuing,” Clendening said. ”He
is also interested in exploring
some other radio opportunities.”

Bogut, known for his mellow
style, was the city’s most popu-
lar broadcaster while at KDKA,
pulling in listener ratings five
times that of any morning com-
petitor.

On Aug. 1, 1983, he joined
WTAE in a deal that included a

morning television program on
WTAE—TV. The television show
was dropped in March 1985.
Bogut’s morning radio show
was overhauled in April 1985 as
”The Jack Bogut Breakfast Club.”
Clendening said he did not
know who will succeed Bogut.

Vignola to challenge
Heinz for Senate seat

HARRISBURG (AP) ~ Former
Philadelphia Controller Joseph
Vignola announced his candida-
cy for the US Senate on Tues-
day, saying Republican
incumbent John Heinz is out of
touch with ”Main Street Penn-
sylvania.”

Vignola, a 38-year-old
Democrat, kicked off his cam-
paign for the party's nomination
with announcements here and in
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The
only other Democrat in the race
so far is John Logue, a Villanova
University professor.

"I have a secret weapon to win

, this year and that's John Heinz’s

record  I know i’m offering a
clear alternative to John Heinz’s

lack of leadership,” Vignola said
at a news conference attended by
Auditor General Don Bailey and
15 members of the state House
and Senate. '

Heinz, heir to the H.J. Heinz
food fortune, was elected to the
Senate in 1976, after serving four
years in the U.S. House. A
Democrat has not won either of
the state's two Senate seats since
1962.

House Majority Leader James
Manderino, D—Westmoreland,
said Vignola is capable of ending
the drought. .

Nofzinger trial starts;
influence peddling?

WASHINGTON — Lyn C. N0f-
ziger used his influence as a
former White House official to
help his clients and enrich his
lobbying business, a prosecutor
at the former presidential aide’s
conflict-of-interest trial charged

today.

”Taking care of your friends is
the first principle of politics for
Mr. Nofziger,” associated in-
dependent counsel Lovida H.
Coleman Jr. said in the prosecu-
tion’s opening statement at Nof—
ziger’s trial.

Nofziger, who resigned as
White House political director in
early 1982 to form a private lob-
bying business, ”used his in-
fluence as a former official with
his friends and colleagues at the
White House in a manner forbid-
den by law,” Coleman told
jurors.

Pa. couple seeks

ERIE, Pa. — A Pennsylvania

”She thinks about the same
thing I do,” Clarence Branch, 77,
said of his wife Lavera, 73. ”It’s
stupid.

”There are so many millions

He said if he could talk to his

GREENFIELD, Mass. (AP) —
Fifth-graders angry about the plas-
tic forks and spoons that ap-
peared in their cafeteria have
hung posters protesting ”School
Is No Picnic” and ”Real People
Deserve Real Silverware.”

Christopher Peters, 11,
described the plastic utensils as
”bumpy, thick, hard to hold 
and eating with them makes you
feel weird all over.”

Peters, a leader of the protest,
said the Four Corners Elementary
School pupils became incensed
when they discovered their stain-
less steel tableware had been
transferred to the high school for
use by what Peters described as
”ugh, teen-agers.”

Using non—violent tactics they
studied last week for the Martin
Luther King Jr. holiday, Chris and
his classmates launched a poster-
making campaign and drew up a

Fifth-graders protest

petition requesting that the stain-
less steel utensils be returned.
By Friday, the youngsters had
gathered 168 signatures from the
school's 316 pupils, ages 5 to 12.

The food service director who
ordered the utensils, however,
said she is unlikely to send them
back. Sandra Herzig said stainless
steel forks and spoons too often
ended up in the trash. ”| end up
replacing about one quarter off
the utensils each year,” she said.

Plastic utensils cost about 5
cents each less than stainless, she
said. ’

She said she replaced table,
ware at all the town's grammar
schools except Four Corners over
the summer. ”That was my mis-
take. Bad timing. Maybe if I'd
replaced it at the beginning of the
year like everybody else, they
wouldn't be upset.”

Nicaragua should

be given a chance

Nicaraguan President’ Daniel Ortega has taken the initiative
to sponsor direct negotiations with Contra leaders. Ortega has
proposed that some political prisoners arrested after the San-
dinistas came to power in 1979 would be released as a con-
cession for the peace talk.

Ortega has also said that there will be ”strong action” taken
on the part of the Sandinista government should Congress ap-
prove additional military aid for the Contras, an idea that makes
more than a little sense to us. i

When the original vote for the new Contra-aid package was
delayed in November, the accepted doctrine was that the Cen-
tral American peace accord should be given a chance to work
before additional funding was approved. Americans, after witt-
nessing the difficulties encountered by the Carter administra-

tion during the Mid—East peace talks, should be acutely aware _

of the time any peace negotiations require.

While it is true that some of the deadlines set forth in the
Arias peace plan have been missed, progress is certainly be-
ing made. For the first time since the war started, the two sides
are willing at least to speak to each other.

The Reagan administration seems to have adopted a policy
of preventive medicine in Nicaragua, at least from its point of
view. Somewhere in the bureaucratic shuffle of Washington,
it would appear that some of our elected officials have lost sight
of the importance of self-determination for other nations. For
there to be lasting peace in Nicaragua, the negotiations
shouldn't take place under the specter of foreign intervention.

President Reagan, in defending his military aid proposal, has
rested his case predominantly on the possibility of Soviet ex-
pansion into the region. Stepping back, if our interest is in peace,
we should wait for the outcome of the negotiations. If, however,
our interest in Nicaragua is only for the acreage it represents
in the U.S.-Soviet power play, then perhaps our priorities are
in need of deeper consideration. ‘ ’

Teachers need more money

The responsibility of educating
is often something attributed sole-

ly to teachers. It’s their fault when .

students don't do well, and they
usually don't receive recognition
when a pupil does do well. There
have been teachers who have
been fired because they didn’t
pass enough students. There have
been school districts sued for giv-
ing diplomas to people who, af-
ter 12 long years of school,
couldn't read or write.

And to top it all off, teachers are
underpaid. Some people in
Rochester, N.Y., have come up
with a plan that they hope will
faster better teachingand hopful—
ly, create better teachers. They
have decided to increase
teachers’ salaries across the board
to amounts far above average
paycheck receivedin other dis-
tricts throughout the United
States.

The experimental plan is aimed

» at recruiting better teachers by

offering salaries that compete
with jobs of equal responsibility.
In short, teachers are going to get
paidreal money.

By offering larger paychecks
and thus raising morale and lur-

WILLIAM
voune

ing better teachers, Rochester is
hoping to cut down its 30 percent
drop-out rate, increase discipline,
and graduate students from high
school with ”good grades” (B5 or
better). Essentially, they are
throwing money at a problem in
the hopes that it will disappear.
Luckily for them, it may work.
The only problem with this
plan is the students. Half the
process in educating a person is
stimulating a student's desire to
learn. The other half is having
someone teach him. A person
can certainly learn on his own, so
there should be some focus in
this experiment on making the

students want to learn -- not just.

on persuading the teachers to
teach better. .

Will the students be expected
to do better on tests by merit of
their learning the material, or will
the teachers be expected to pass
more students based on some
sort of flexible criteria? How are

teachers supposed to inspire
someone to learn who places no
value on education?

The problem school districts
have isn't confined entirely to the
teachers’ teaching abilities per se.
True, the teachers may be able to
teach better (and the pay raise
may be an ‘adequate incentive),
but teachers in Rochester have
been sending well-prepared stu-
dents to universities and into the
job market for a long time
without higher pay or new teach-
ing ideas.

The problem lies in convinc-
ing the students that an education
is something valuable to have.
Perhaps the parents of the stu-
dents will try successfully to pass
on important values to their chil-

dren concerning education to

make the teachers’ jobs easier.
Maybe the teachers will come up
with newer, more innovative
ways to present their material.

Maybe the students will under-,

stand that reading is a far more
valuable skill than being able to
dunk a basketball or jump a curb
with your skateboard." Maybe.

in Mathematics and Social
Science,” will center on» two
specific areas: the effectiveness of
teachers’ explanations and the
process of argumentation.

Dr. Gaea Leinhardt, co—director

of the program, said that the pur-
pose of researching explanations
”is to gain a deeper understand-
ing of how people doing a com-
plex problem think.”
‘ Leinhardt will study how stu-
dents and teachers explain ideas
on tape and will ask other
teachers and students todiscuss
what they understood from them.
She explained, "One of“ the
things we want to come out of
this is to be able to educate peo-
ple how to teach better.

”We’re asking a group of
researchers to write research-
based articles on specific topics

in mathematics,” she added.

According to Dr. William Bick-
el, a senior scientist at LRDC, the
goals of the AFT and Pitt's LRDC
include informing math teachers
of the difficulties elementary and
middle school students would
have in the comprehension of
fundamental math concepts.
Also, the program hopes to sup-
ply teachers with instruction on
how to improve their teaching in
content areas.

”This first year, we're develop-
ing a structure for the program,”
said Bickel. ”Both organizations
[AFT and LRDC] felt that math is
a critically important area in edu-
cation and that, especially in the
early grades, teachers come in
the field with not a lot of
mathematics training.”

Dr. Alan Lesgold, co—director of
the program, will study the stu-
dents and the skills needed for

grants for cognitive studies

people to improve their ability to
work together to resolve differing
viewpoints on a situation.

Lesgold said, ’’It is new
research. It started because we
were interested in the use of a
computer in learning." He plans
on having the computers act as
discussion coaches that will help
students practice their dialectical
skills. ”We are initially focusing
more on the dialectical skills of
students, than using the computer
as a learning tool.”

According to Lesgold, learning
is looked at in different ways.
”Learning can be viewed as peo-
ple working together,” he said.
”Too many people learn by be-
ing told what to do. There is not
enough learning by experience.”

The research project will begin
during the summer months of
l988i.

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Curtis
Bray, a suburban Pittsburgh line-
backer named to most of the na-
tional scholastic All-America
teams, said Tuesday he will at-
tend the University of Pittsburgh.

The 6-foot-4, 220-pound Bray,
from Gateway High School in
Monroeville, Pa., has canceled a
planned visit to Notre Dame be-
cause ’’I had always thought
about going there [Pitt] even be-

”Maybe it was because of the
city. I really didn't like the cam-
puses I visited,” Bray said.) ”Pitt
was where I felt best about where
I could go for four years.  I liked
the school, the surroundings.”

Bray, who made the USA To-
day and Parade /\/Iagazaine All-
America teams, also considered
Penn State and Michigan State.
Among the other schools that
made recruiting pitches were
Georgia Tech, Michigan, Clem-
son, Syracuse, West Virginia and
Stanford.

The Pitt wrestling team
faced off against "Lehigh
University Monday night in
the most exciting meet of the
season. After all was said and
done, the Panthers pulled off
a 21-17 win.

The win improved the Pan-
thers record to 4-0, Lehigh fall-
ing to a very uncharacteristic
2-6. .

”This was a better match
than the ones earlier in the
season,” said Pitt coach Rande
Stottlemyer. ”I knew that it
was going to take all 10 guys
to do It."

The largest crowd to see a
Pitt meet this year at Fitzger-
ald Field House was ready to
go even before the referee
blew the whistle to start the

 

 

first match.

They were soon quieted
when the Engineers’ Ed Regan
toppled Panther Brian O’Korn
10-1.

That was the last lull in the
meet. The Panthers totally
dominated the the next four
matches to take a 17-4 lead.

”Everybody pulled through
tonight,” Pitt All-America Pat
Santoro said after improving
his record to 30-0, with yet
another pin.

Pure entertainment was
what Pitt freshman Scott
Hovan (18-10) provided at
150.

Throughout the first period,
Hovan threw his opponent,
Chad Watkins, to the mat.
Then, instead of going for the
pin, he got off Watkins’ back
and ran to the center of the
ring.

-I1iniorlMatt Glerhard "helped carry -the Panthers toa rilvinlaoverlllléhigh. I

Panthers catch Lehigh at righttime

This unusual tactic led one
fan to say, ’’If he keeps doing
that, he's going to get caught.”

Hovan never got caught and
dominated the rest of his
match for a 16-7 win.

’’In the first period, I knew
there was no way I could turn

» him over,” said Hovan. ’’I had

mytakedowns going pretty
good, so I figured that was my
best chance. I wrestled him
before, so I knew that he
would try to slow it down. I
just put it to him.”

There are 10 matches in a
college wrestling meet. In
Pitt’s three earlier dual meets,
the winner was decided by the
fifth match. This one wasn't
decided until the ninth.

Pitt freshman Perry Miller
(3-8) came to the center of the
mat to battle with Lehigh’s
Matt Ruppel (11-3).

 
 

The fans were as loud as
could be, hoping that their
voices would be able to carry
Perry to victory.

Both wrestlers looked even-
ly matched throughout the first
period. Ruppel took the lead
in the second, 6-5, setting up
the pivitol third period.

”Perry’s match was excit-
ing,” said Santoro. ”He did a
great job against one of the
better wrestlers in the
country.”

As the last period was near-
ing the end, it looked as if the
meet would depend on Pitt’s
winning the last match.

Then, Miller somehow es-
caped from Ruppel. The place
exploded as Miller was award-
ed one point.

He held on for the tie. This

gave Pitt a lead of 21-14.. The

tle bit. When was the last time the
NFL’s pre-playoff Super Bowl
favorite was as harshly bounced
from the premises as the San
Francisco 49ers were two Sun-
days ago against the Minnesota
Vikings?

And then as a result, when was
the last time that the respective
NFL championship games were
about as ”pick ’em as possible,”
no clear favorites, no clear un-
derdogs?

Quite some time, if ever. But in
1988, it was a sure ”anything
goes.”

But the Redskins, with a pretty
impressive showing from the hal-
lowed second coming of the
Over—the-Hill-Gang defense,
knocked out the upstart Minneso-

ta Vikings 17-10 to earn their first
trip to the Super Bowl since
1983.

All right, calling the ’Skins
defense the new Over-the—Hill
Gang may be going a bit too far
when considering the abundant
youth in the secondary, but those
Washington linebackers have
been around pretty much the
whole decade, and Charles
Mann, Daryl Grant, Dexter Man-
ley and Dave Butz on the defen-

sive line aren't. actually spring
Sioux themselves either.

And then on the other side of
the field, it's John EIway's Den-
ver Broncos. Without Elway,
Denver is certainly nothing spe-
cial, probably not even AFC West
champs. With him, well, they're
in the Super Bowl for the second
consecutive year. .

Redskins’ veterans mix well with youth

By David Ginsburg

9 AP Sports Writer

HERNDON, Va. — Take 16
veterans with Super Bowl ex-
perience, add about 30 young,
spirited players who are itching
to get there, and you've got the
Washington Redskins’ formula
for a successful season.

”We’ve got a lot of youthful
guys who have really contribut-
ed to this team, and we have a
good blend of veterans," said

center Jeff Bostic. ”When you've '

got that combination, you're go-
ing to go places.”
' Like San Diego, to play the

Denver Broncos in the Super
Bowl.

Veterans such as Bostic, Dave
Butz and Dexter Manley were
with the Redskins when the team
went to consecutive Super Bowls
in 1982 and 1983. While their
performances this season helped
Washington make a return trip,
they were no less valuable than
some of the team's younger
players.

On offense, rookie running
back Timmy Smith had a team-
high 138 rushing yards in the
Redskins’ two playoff victories,
and second-year receiver Ricky

On defense, eighth—round draft
pick Clarence Vaughn had four
tackles and a sack in the NFC ti-
tle game against Minnesota, first-
year linebackers Kurt Gouveia
and Ravin Caldwell combined for
three tackles and two sacks
against the Vikings, and rookie
Brian Davis recovered a fumble.

”Our defensive coaches did a
great job on the game plan,” said
Redskins Coach Joe Gibbs. ”We
incorporated a lot of young guys
who weren't playing that much,
and they showed up and did a
great job.

’’Really, the advantage we have
here is that we have 16 guys who
have been to the Super Bowl and
knew what it took to get there,"
Gibbs continued. ”And yet we
had a majority of young guys
who had never been there, were
hungry, and decided they were
going to do whatever it takes.
And they fed off the older play-
ers’ experience.”

While youth was a factor, it is

, impossible to overlook the perfor-

mance of some of the veterans
who were anxious to return to the

‘Super Bowl and wipe away the

taste of their last trip, a humiliat-
ing 38-9 loss to the Los Angeles

Raiders.

Butz, at 37 the oldest defensive
player in the NFL, had two sacks
against Minnesota and tipped a
pass that turned into a intercep-
tion and three important points.
When Butz played his first NFL
game, each of the current crop of
Redskin draft choices was still in
grade school.

”I don't think of him [Butz] as
being as old as he is,” Gibbs said.
”It seems like he can go on
forever. He still has a young heart
and still gets excited when he
makes a big play.”

Meanwhile, Gibbs said he

Broncos use playoff earnings as
a motivational factor in ‘Bowl’

By John Mossman
AP Sports Writer

DENVER — When the Denver
Broncos resume practice this
week in preparation for the Super
Bowl, they'll find a message on
the blackboard in the meeting
room.

Arranged vertically are the
figures $10,000, $18,000 and
$36,000, with the sum of
$64,000. ,

Presumably none of the players
will be asking the $64,000 ques-
tion: What does it mean? It's the
amount of money each Bronco
player stands to earn by beating
Washington on Jan. 31.

The Bronco organization is
hoping the simple math problem
computes better than a previous
monetary demonstration. In
1984, officials arranged a stack of
$1 bills totalling the amount the

’ players could earn throughout the

playoffs. But the message didn't
take; Denver promptly lost to
Pittsburgh 24-17 in the first
round.

Denver coach Dan Reeves had
a different kind, of visual aid for
his players the day before the
AFC championship game against
Cleveland on Sunday.

Reeves arranged his six cham-
pionship rings on the. lectern in
the meeting room — five of
which he won as a player and
coach with the Dallas Cowboys
— and told his players that when
their careers are over, the senti-
ment of a championship ring will
mean more than anything else a
playermight attain.

”What I told them was I had
played or coached in 10 cham-
pionship games before Sunday,”
Reeves said. ”I made $80,000 [in
playoff money], but all of it is
gone. When you have a family,
it goes pretty fast. But the fact that
you played in one — nobody can
ever take that away from you. I
wanted to impress that on them.”

Wide receiver Steve Watson
said Reeves told the players that
”this is what can happen to you
if you work hard. You can have
a lot of these.”

This time it worked, as the
Broncos defeated Cleveland
38-33 to make their second
straight trip to the Super Bowl.

Reeves is the first to admit that
it has been an improbable

‘ journey.

The retirements of four defen-
sive starters, major injuries to

a seven other key players and the

disruption of the strike did not
bode well for a return Super Bowl
engagement.

”Somehow, this team over-
came those things. Whenever we
got an injury, somebody came in
and did the job for us. We got
solid performances from people
we never even counted on,"
Reeves said.

”Mike Freeman is our starting
center, and he wasn't even on the
team at the start of the season.
[Guard] Stefan Humphries is
another example of that. I didn't
think [tight end] Clarence Kay
would have the type of season
he's had. When we drafted [wide
receiver] Ricky Nattiel in the first
round, we thought he'd be a
good football player, but we
didn't expect he'd be as good as
he's been. ‘

”l’ve never been associated
with a championship team that
has undergone so many changes.
We ended the‘ season with only
[nose guard] Greg Kragen and
[linebacker] Ricky Hunley play-
ing the same position on defense

they played in last year's Super '

Bowl. It's been remarkable.”

The Broncos will begin gearing
up for the Redskins on Thursday.

Webster unsure of next season,

may not return for 15th year

(AP) — Mike Webster, the vet-
eran center who has played more
games than any other player in
the Pittsburgh Steelers’ history,
said Tuesday he hasn't decided
whether to return for a club-
record 15th season.

0' Two of the three remaining

players from the Steelers’ four Su-
per Bowl title teams, wide
receiver John Stallworth and

Bowl

Continued from page 7
Cleveland showdown. The
downtrodden Vikings, under
then first—year head coach Jerry
Burns, came back to life in 1986,
finishing 9-7 and missing the

-O playoffs by just one game. In

1987, Minnesota went a medi-
ocre 8-7 but lost all three replace-
ment games in the process.
Then they came to life, wiping
out the New Orleans Saints 44-10
in the NFC wildcard game, then
manhandling the 49ers 36-24.

And in the final minute on Sun-
day, if Darrin Nelson catches

_ Wade Wilson's fourth-down pass

at the Washington goal line, Min-
nesota is first—and-inches away
from shooting it out with the Red-
skins in overtime.

Instead, the perfectly placed
ball somehow bounces off Nel-
son's bicep, and Washington
heads off to San Diego for its
fourth Super Bowl appearance.

Same sort of thing happened in
Denver. The Browns, picked by
many to capture the AFC title in
1987 after losing the champion-
ship to the same Denver Broncos
a yearearlier, stormed back from
a 21-3 halftime deficit and trailed
38-31 with a minute to play and
the ball on Denver’s 8—yard line.

Then a well-executed trap play,
but Ernest Byner fumbled the
ball, and the game, away to the
Broncos at the 3.

A classic game with an unclas-
sic finish.

If Byner scores, or even gets the
first down by holding on to the
football, Cleveland ties and the

A two head into overtime.

If Byner scores and Matt Bahr
makes the 45-yard attempt he
missed at the end of the first half,
Cleveland wins. Simple as that.

On the other hand, que sera
sera. Denver, 3‘/2-point favorites,

‘or Washington are not all that

overpowering, as were the New
York Giants, Chicago Bears, the
49ers and other past Super Bowl
winners of the 19805, but then
that's probably all for the better.
The Super Bowl was meant to be
a perennial clash of the titans, if
not an entertaining, well-played
football game. What Commis-
sioner Pete Rozelle didn't have in

mind was a yearly replay of the" _
British at Balaklava, and that's

what the NFL’s grand ball has
turned out to be over the years.

The Broncos and the Redskins
are only shoulders above the rest
of the league in overall talent. But
when standing back—to—back,
strengths and weaknesses balanc-

‘ ing out, the two are standing at

pretty much the same height.
Hopefully that will be enough to
make it interesting the whole 60
minutes through. For once.

strong safety Donnie Shell, an-
nounced Monday they will retire.

Webster indicated last month
that he planned to return for the
1988 season. He joined the Steel-
ers in 1974 and played on their
Super Bowl championship teams
duringthe1974, 1975,1978 and
1979 seasons. 1

’’It’s too soon to decide any-
thing,” Webster said. ’’It sounds

like Stall and Donnie [Shell] had

their minds made up already.
They must have known for a
while. I really haven't given it
much thought yet.

_’’I haven't let go of this season
yet, so it is way too soon to think
about next season.”

Webster, who has missed only
four NFL games because of inju-
ries, has played in a Steeler-
record 204 games.

Gymnasts defeat Eastern Michigan

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's gymnastics team
Competed at Eastern Michigan
University this past weekend. The
Panthers won, scoring a 237.9 to
Eastern Michigan's 182.25.

Head Coach Frank D’Amico
said, ”We had a tough time. Our
score was not very good. We
need a lot of improvement.”

The Panthers’ previous meet
was at Navy, where they scored
one of their highest preseason to-
tals ever with a score of 252.6.

”We were more banged up
than we were at Navy, but we
just missed a lot of routines,” said
D’Amico. “We had a lot of major
breaks, but I thought the judging
was fair, it was not a factor.”

exercise for Pitt were by Jorge
Gonzalez, Pat Pollaci and Steve
Powanda. On the pommel horse,
Gonzalez, Brock Freehling and
Pollaci were the top Panthers.

Gonzalez scored a 9.5, which
is a school record.

The high score on the rings for
Pitt were by Gonzalez, Pollaci,
Freehling and Powanda. Top
vaulters were Powanda, Gonza-
lez and Chris O’Lough|in.

On the parallel bars, the top
Panthers were Freehling, Pollaci
and Gonzalez. On the high bar,
Don Bullard, Freehling and Gon-
zalez finished first, second and
third, respectively.

’’It was a good meet. We had
no injuries. We stuck together as
a team,” said assistant Coach
Marty Comini. ”Our pommel

Came back on the parallel bars
and high bar. We learned to Con-
centrate through thick and thin.
We showed strong team unity.”

”l was a little disappointed with
our performance,” D’Amico said.

 

We were more
banged up than we
were at Navy, but we
just missed a lot of
routines.

—— Frank D’Amico

’’If we hit our routines and do our
jobs at Madison [James Madison
Invitational], our scores should
approach the 2505. We'll be
more prepared. I look forward to

’’It was a tight meet. We need
that type to show us our mistakes.
I'm confident that in the next two
weeks, our scores will improve.”

”We still have a lot of improv-
ing to do to increase our sCores,”
said Keith Barsky. ”We should
score higher.”

The Panthers Competed
without two seniors. Jorge San-
chez continues to be troubled by
back problems, and Dan Tarosky
is still recovering from a broken
hand.

’’It wasn't one of our best
meets,” said Dan Bullard. ”This
meet was a good kick in the pants
for us to get moving in the gym
so we can go out and win at
James‘ Madison.”

Pitt's next meet, the James
Madison Invitational, will be held

Redskins

plans to make a few changes in
the team's training schedule. In
1983, the players had no Curfew
to adhere to, but this time will be
decidedly different.

”When we get there, it's impor-
tant for the players to enjoy it and
have a good time, but they have
to be careful at night with the ac-
tivities they get Caught up in,”

Gibbs said. ’’I’d prefer they spend.

a normal evening, with friends or
relatives. Last time, there was no
Curfew, but this time it will be
around [midnight .”

The Redskins leave for San Die-
go Monday.

’’I’m pleased with the per-

will be able to beat anyone.”

The Panthers travel to Ash-
