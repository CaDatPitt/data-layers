Gardner States Views   on Feminism

by LINDA SAVAGE

Dr. Joanne Gardner. member
of the National Organization for
Women, NOW,’ Inc., expressed her
views on “Feminism as a Life-
Style” in a lecture Wednesday as
part of the Alternative Life Style

./Jonference.

According to Gardner. “A fem‘-
inist is a person who advocates
such changes that will result in
social, political. and economic
equality between the sexes?” She
added though that ’today’s defini-
tion of feminist usually implies
that she is also an activist for her
cause. but this is not necessarily
true. She explained that many
women are feminists but do not
become actively involved in the
movement.

She went on to clarify “the mis-
conception that all feminists are
female.” From her involvement
in the movement she has noticed
males as wellas females are ad-
esocating. equality of the sexes.
“Usually the males that are in-
volved are those that have had

“What It’s Like to be a Homo-
sexual” was the topic of a panel
discussion by four members‘ of
the Pittsburgh gay community on
Wednesday at 12 noon in the Stu-
dent Union Ballroom, as part ot'
the three-day Alternate Life
Styles Conference.

stated that the purpose of the dis-

goodirelationships with a femin-
ist,” she said.

Gardner discussed what it was
like to be a feminist and the transi-
tions one experiences in becoming

— one.

Individually becoming a femin-

. ist. she stated, means getting tired

of being put down because you are
a woman. At first, she explained.
you become irritated because you
can’t get a good job. Then you be-
come really angry, she added, and
start to question and challenge
the roles of men and women in our
society. “Gradually.” she said.
"you find yourself interacting
less and less with male chauvin-
ist pigs and with women who say.
‘I really like men to open doors
for me.”

Then you begin to see “a world
in which women and men could be

friends like women and women’

are friends and men and men are
friends in today’s society. What
the feminist movement is trying
to say,” she explained, “is that

I’m not just a man or a'woman—
I’m a human being.”

She went on to explain that so-
ciety often stereotypes feminists
as sick people, because “people
who do not follow the established
pattern are sick . . . women who
are assertive or aggressive are
sick." Gardner maintains that the
feminist movement is today view-
ed as being lead by "sick” women.

One issue that the feminist

movement has become particu-
lary involved with, she said, is
abortion. Though Gardner stated
that she would never personally
have an abortion, she added, “I
personally think to force a woman
to carry another developing life in

,her body that she does not want is

slavery.” She would like to see
the law changed so that women
could have an abortion just as
easily as they could have any
other operation.

said. cannot join the armed serv-

in the service can receive a dis-

to say gay couples cannot adopt
children, gay marriages are not‘

ers. have no legal claim on their
partner's estate after death‘.

Huggins stated that landlords

.- of suspicion that a felony was

committed on the premises. Laws
dealing with sex (such as sodo-

against gay people, he said.

Even the Liquor Control Board
discriminates against homosex-

legal establishments catering to
gays. But he admitted that this
regulation is not enforced.

Huggins pointed out thatiWest—

homosexuals by teaching that the

that many gay people leave the

in the program.

The lecture. entitled “The Com-
mune——Another Way of Living To-
gether," was given at noon by Dr.
Judson Jerome, author of several
books and formerly professor
emeritus of English literature at
Antioch College. He nowlives at
Downhill Farm, a commune near
Hancock. Md.

Jerome spoke of his concep-
tions of and experiences in com-
munal living.

_ "For the first time.“ Jerome
said. "we have a broad based op-
portunity to make conscious
choices about how to live.“

He refuted the popular image of
the commune as a modern-day
idea utilized by only young drug
users. “People in North America
from the -Pilgrims on have dream-
ed of attaining a Utopian sort of
communal living. Twenty thou-
sand people in North America are
living in communes today. This is
not a new or a youth-oriented
phenomenon. As far as the drug
current studies
show that people from cities who
went to communes tended to turn
away from drugs.”

Jerome attributed the appeal of

communes to society's “standard-
ization” of everyone’s life, a pro-

‘cess that creates “shallow exis-

tences.” He explained, “In some
sense, our society is not providing
for a large percentage, of our pop-
ulation. Above all, communal liv-
ing is a" search for meaning. Too
many ways of employment in our
society lack this sense of mean-
ing.” V

The commune as an alternative
to conventional family living was
also explored. "Among some seg-
ments of the population today.
there is a dissatisfaction with the
‘nuclear family‘ and a tremen-
dous urge to recapture certain re-
lationships.“ Jerome explained.

“The ideal model is to build a
kind of group where each member
achieves his individual fulfill-
ment. Each member reaches a

greater degree of intimacy and

acceptance of one another. yet—

com-
munal living is a search for mean-
ing. Too many ways of employment
in our society luck this sense of
meaning.”

and here’s the paradox——a great-.

er individuality.”

_ One of the situations which com- ’ '

munities must adapt to is the lack
of personal privacy. “It’s not un-
usual for me to go to bed with a
dozen people in the room. The
norm in communal living is to be
together rather thangto be alone—

the customary norm,” said Je- 

l‘0ll’l€.

On the commune as an alterna-
tive to marriage, Jerome said,

the rest are not particularly char-
acteristic of communes. They are’
occupied by more or less mono-
gamous couples, but the gravita-

ognize that a person may change
from time to time." .

The panel discussion began at
7:30*p.m. and explored “Styles of
Communes.” The body of speak-
ers was composed of Jerome, who
discussed the anarchistic com-
mune; Herbert Goldstein on -the
agrarian commune: Rodney Jo-
sephson on the religious com-
mune; Myran Marx on the urban
commune, and moderator Peter

other people’, need a social life and
must communicate with other
people. She said that gay people
do not necessarily dislike the
company of members of the op-
posite sex.

Lane described two local gay
organizations that provide so-
cial and political activities for
homosexuals: ’

ganization open to people of all
sexual orient tions which pro—.
motes communication between
people, and GSP (Gay Students at
Pitt). a recognized University or-
ganization with open membership
that encourages gay people to
work together.

OVERWHELMINGLY BEAUTIFUL scenery and costumes were found in the production of Choon Hyan Jun, a 'l7th

Korean Stude~ntsProduce Musical T

by JOHN A. CAAPITMAN

Students from the Soodo Wom-
en’s Teachers College of Seoul,
Korea, presented a disappointing
production of the well-known 17th
century musical drama, Choon
Hyan Jun, at the Stephen C. Fos-
ter Memorial on Tuesday evening.

The performance of this Yi Dyn-
asty romanlce, -which relates the
adventures of a country maiden
and her up-andicoming govern-
ment official lover as they battle
against the power of traditional
marriage structures and covet-\
ous, lascivious governor generals.
was given as a part of the fourth
annual Festival of Asian Art and
Music, sponsored by -the Asian
Studies Department. K

One would suppose, considering
the sponsor, that the" production

l

would at least «be a modern in-
terpretation of Choon Hyang Jun-

an interpretation would empha-..

size the particularly Korean, for-
mal, and stylistic aspects of this
classic tale.

Yet this was not the case. The
audience saw, instead, a ballet
closely akin to a confused high
school production of Romeo and
’Juliet, where the emphasis has
been placed on cutting through
the admittedly difficult, though
undeniably most significant poe-
try and exposing the tale in a high-

» ly, sentimentalized, meaningless
- _modern way.

And like those high school bas-
tardizations, the Soodo Wom'en’s
Teachers College production was
confused by atrocious, almost hu-
morous anomalies. Simply, Yi
Dynasty drama was a highly

stylized exact art form. which did
not and does not call for male
characters doing loose entre-

' chats and female characters do-'
' ing pirouettes with their hair fall-

ing loos_ely to their shoulders.

But the above -only begins to
suggest the degree to which this
production of Choon Hyang Jun
broke with traditional form. With
the exception of several wonder-
ful, exciting moments where the
music and dancing was indeed
Korean, the production both in
terms of choreographic technique
and musical content remained at
the level of a bad imitation of
Stravinsky produced by a televi-
sion dance troupe. '

And yet the elements of the pro-

duction which had not been left to

‘ succumb to the temptations of a

Western mass-media style were.
for an American, almost over-
whelmingly -beautiful. The scen-
ery, a series of diaphonous silk

screens painted in muted colors,
and the costumes, each perform-
er wearing multiple layers of
brightly printed silk, were both
attractive and unusual.

The Soodo Women’s' Teachers
College production of Choon Hy-

ang Jun was, in short, a telling

example of the effect of mating

the brilliant sense of joyous sty1- if

ization of 17th centry Korean dra-
ma with the depressing remnants

‘ of Western ballet that high schools

and television have left us. Tues-
day’s performance was an inaus-
picious beginning for a Festival
of Asian Art and Music. because it
represented the disconcerting.
disappointing results of trying to
make sophisticated theater palat-
able by turning it into something
far less than it really is.

, ka (formerly Ceylon),

 

The University continues to
draw foreign students and schol-
ars in increasing numbers, ac-
cording to latest enrollment fig-
ures released by the University.

The figures show 894 students,
research scholars, and faculty
currently registered at Pitt, an in-
crease ofo49 over last year. The
new total is almost four times the
number which registered at Pitt
ten years ago, when the total was
235.

George O’Bannon, director of
International Student Services at
Pitt; said the continued increase
is in contrast to many other
American educational institutions
of similar size and enrollment
which are experiencing reduced
enrollment from overseas coun-
tries. «

Pitt’s international population

, comes from 91 countries from ev-

ery corner of the globe, and in-
cludes countries/ with such glam-
orous—sounding names as’Sri Lan-
Malawi
(forrrierly Nyasaland), Botswana
(formerly Bechuanaland), Zam-
bia (formerly ‘Northern Rho-
desia), Zaire (formerly Belgian

‘_ Congo), and Lesotho (formerly

Basutoland ).

e statistical breakdown

shows 740 graduate and 70 under-
graduate students, 58 research-
ers, and 26 faculty, an outnum-
ber five to one: 677 to 133.

Director O’Bannon says that
while Pitt enjoys an overall -in-
crease, it shares a national trend
which finds graduate student
ranks increasing and undergrad-
uates decreasing. This is attri-
buted to the relatively meager
amount of assistance available at
the undergraduate level while
graduate "students find support
from governments interested in
develping their trained manpow-
er. «

Enrollment of foregin graduate
"students is heaviest in the Grad-
uate School of/Public and Interna-
tional Affairs’ and slightly lower
in education and physics.

Worldwide regional distribution
shows relatively. few students
coming from nearby countries,
while the numbers seem to in-
crease in proportion to the dis-
tance removed. Thus, only 29 are
here from Canada and 37 from
Central America and the Carib-

_bean, while 115 come from South
America. The total for all of Eur-
ope is 91, while North Africa and
the Middle East are represented
by 139 students and the sub—Sa-
hara region of Africa 80 more.

“We’re learning to live without
explicit structures, hierarchies

Jerome traced the recent rise
in the popularity of communes.

make everyone the same, equal.

The first and most significant ’

breakdown in that dream was the
slogan ‘Black Power.’ Then every-
one began to diversify, ethnically

and personally. Society is now .-

moving toward immense plural-A

ism. There is a very high toler- '
«ance among communal groups for

varied life _styles, which makes
for a diversified cultural scene.”

 .-How Much Is Th at

    
  
 

On November 14. 1972. the business manager of the Sky-

scraper Engineer sent the following query to the Department of

Physical Plant:

_‘ "Please estimate the cost to purchase and install floures—

 cent light on wall above drawingtablef‘ V

iii The reply cited the costs: labor. $114; material. $50; over-

_}’;head. $16; total, $196. " y

l V According to the Sears, Roebuck Company, the largest

.  flourescent light fixture in stock costs $34.95. Salesmen. in the
f lighting department at Sears are able to install these fixtures

 for-display in approximately 15 minutes by following the instruc-

 tions packaged with the fixture.

On the same date Skyscraper also requested Physical Plant

_'--?.;'“‘.to “Please estimate the time and cost to install two window'

  screens in room 408 Schenley Hall.“
 _The reply was: labor. $205; material. $39; overhead. $26:

;}j_. total, $270. V

 Sears, Roebuck Company carries screens for double hung
 ‘windows that would fit the windows in room 408 for $3.69 a
 piece.
._.§ Last Spring the editor of the yearbook requested an esti-
.~.,. mate from Physical Plant for the cost of painting three offices.
 -.’._‘3’.The reply, accdrding to Editor Gary Spicuxza. was 35 cents per
 square foot. On determining the size of the three offices to be
 painted he found’that the cost would amount to approximately
 $1,000.  '
' A I He could do the job himself for $35.
 The same department charged the Amateur Radio Club
  $350 to install an antenna that the club had purchased for $50.

, _ For $270, Skyscraper could forget about screens and install

A j an air conditioner. For $1.000 the Owl could furnish editors with

 /summer scholarships. For the $350 installation charge the Radio
Club could have purchased seven antennas.

, At this rate, all the gold in Fort Knox could not pay for the
 proposed refurbishment of the Student Union.

Apathy Triumphs

by RALPH DEAN

Student apathy is an old story
on college campus. I spent a year
and a half at University Park ob-
serving this phenomonon. They
don‘t call it “Happy Valley" for
nothing. Things were so bad up
there that one character ran for
Undergraduate Student Govern-
ment on a platform of apathy. He
didn't bother showing for rallies.
“fell asleep" during a radio inter-
view. and generally didn't bother
with campaigning. He darn near
won.

Pitt students are no different-
with all their griping and com-
plaining about what‘s wrong with
their University. very few actual-
ly try to do anything to improve it.

Three reasons are usually put
forward to explain this. One is
that students are busy enough
with academics. The large week-
night crowds at the local bars
make this hard to believe.

The second. more plausable rea-
son is that students are lazy. I
know first—hand that this is true.
for at least part of the time. of
most of us.

The third reason is that stu-
dents are really given no chance
to make change in the institution
anyway. so nobody bothers. Until
recently. I had great belief in this.

But last December students
were given a chance to participate
in University planning through
“task forces,” established by Dr.
Arlon Elser. These committees
were given a push by Mrs. Sharon
Novak, a student member of the
Board of Trustees. Undergrad-
uate student suggestions, ideas‘,
comments were asked for.

Apathy /triumphed. Not one un-
dergraduate has submitted a
word. I

The Pitt News, in its first issue
this term. printed a list of the

names of the student members on
these task forces. to whom ideas
were to be submitted. In the hope
that someone with ideas missed
the list. it is reprinted here. If
you don't want to bother with it.
then at least stop complaining for
a while.

Letters to the Editor .

Think Up

Editor. The Pitt News:

_,- With the arrival of the new year.
KDKA Radio has developed a new
campaign which will embrace the

entire city in a unique way. The

campaign: Pittsburgh . . . Some
Place Special. will have as its pre-
mise the concept that Pittsburgh
is a unique place with much" to be
proud of. much to correct. and
much to discover. The station will
attempt to develop in Pittsburgh-
ers a new attitude. a "Think Up.
Think Positive" attitude towards
their city.

We hope to accomplish this
awareness and feeling of good will
by making use ofour broadcast
power with more emphasis on
public service broadcasting. We
hope to become involved in com-
munity activities. perhaps set up
remotes at special events sites.
or sponsoring our own activities
geared to discovery within the
city. Potential for activities is
boundless.

KDKA Radio would like to ex-
tend to colleges and universities
an open door for ideas and activ-
ities. We are willing to act as a
catalyst, t'or improvement cam-
paigns. etc. If there is any possi-
bility of conducting an “idea-ex-
change" between station and cam-
pus via our media and yours. we
are open to suggestions.

We hope our campaign is as ex-
citing to you as it is to us and that
we can use the power of communi-
cation we both have to develop

Pittsburgh . . . Some Place Spe-
cial into a meaningful concept.
Please feel free to contact us
about any plans or ideas you have
for including the student popula-
tion in this all-encompassing ef-
fort.
Cordially.

Editor. The Pitt News:

Anyone attempting to study on .

the second floor of Hillman Li-
brary faces an impossible task.
After waiting in impossibly

long lines in the reserve room.
one must put up with an unbear-
able amount of noise emenating
the rest of the mob.

On other floors one is constant-
lylbombarded by the noise from
penicl Sharpeners, buzzing flour-
escent lights, change machines,
and Xerox copiers.

The constant jabbering of stu-
dents who use the facility tor a
student lounge. adds to the din and
makes working in the library like
trying to study at the zoo.

There .are places on campus

other than the library for stu-.

dents to congregate and places

other than the study areas for ‘

copy machines and pencil sharp-

eners. .
Students themselves could cut

the noice pollution in halfby re-

serving the libraryfor study pur-’ I

poses and conducting conversa-
tions elsewhere.

With classes in the Cathedral
being drowned out by passing

trucks. constant conversation in.

the commons room. and the dis-
tractions of the residence halls.
Pitt students need at least one
bastion of quiet on campus.

Operatic Film Brings

Mozart's Don to Life

By ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

Those of us who have suffered
through operatic films suffered
just a little more than usual this
past week. when the film version
of Don Giovanni was shown at
Heinz Hall. Billed as a classic.
the Salzburg Festival Production
of the opera was the staple of the
cinematic action throughout.
Quite frankly. the attempt was
not as promising as it may sound
from such an illustrious billing.

There is little doubt that this
production is a classic; after all.
Wilhelm Furtwangler was its
conductor. a musician as “at
home" with Mozart as well as
with Wagner. During the over-
ture there were some very rare
shots offthe maestrogon the
podium. showing his command-
ing knowledge of all involved.
Despite the fact that Furtwangler
was at the helm. however. this
filmed version did not come off
very well at all.

The debate, of course, contin-
ues to range over the marriage
between the cinema and the op-
era and the offspring that have
been produced as a result of the
alliance. We will not continue
that debate here but will say
only that this production was a
maimed child at best. Bad sound,
bad staging, and perhaps even
bad singing (very often difficult
to discern due to a scrathchy
sound track) combined to provide

a rather disconcerting experience ’

for the spectator.

The root of the matter stems
from the fact that what is very

often a success on the stage in
live performance deteriorates
under the lens of a motion pic-
ture camera. This was the Salz-
burg stage production intact and
this was very probably the
reason for failure. During scenes
of little or no action the camera-
man seemed at a loss as to just
what was to be done with his
equipment". In addition. splicing
was bad as was the color photo-
graphy. .

Needless to say, some comfor-
table words are at hand. This
was one of the earliest of the
filmed opera attempts and per-
fection was hardly possible. The
cast at hand was a glorious one:
Cesare Siepi‘as the Don, Lisa
Della Casa and Elizabeth Grum-
mer as the Donnas, and a multi-
tude of others (Even Walter Bee-
ry was present, looking naievly
young and greenhornish.)

Some of the arias were very
well done and the scene.of the
Don‘s departure for hell,enter-
taining if nothing else. Indeed.
there was much about this entire

production that brought many a_

chuckle to the viewer as should
be expected. Operas like Don
Giovanni are certainly proof that
the form must certainly be one of
the silliest creations of Western
man. Nonetheless. we enjoy it.
even though most of us can‘t
understand a word of what is be-
ing sung. we make it our business
to - attend. even when the pros-
pects are not the best. And that
certainly is the case with opera
in Pittsburgh. even when it is on
film.

Taverner /Vlass Set

For Renaissance Liturgy

An event of both cultural and
religious significance occurs this
Sunday next when the Madrigal
Singers of the University of Pitts-
burgh under the direction of Dr.
Don Franklin presents a Renais-
sancemass within the framework
of the Roman Catholic liturgy.

Commencing at 3:00 P.M.. the
clergy of "the University Ora-
tory will process to the chancel
of Heinz Chapel as a schola
cantorum of singers ‘chants the
plain-song introit. The ordinary.
which follows sung by the Mad-
rigal Singers, will be John Tavern-
er‘s "Mass of the Western Wind".
a Tudor‘ composition of the early
sixteenth century. In keeping
with the Renaissance mood of
the work. the entire mass will be

celebrated in Latin.

The celebrant for the occasion
will be Bishop John B. McDowell.
auxiliary bishop of the Roman
Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh.
Father Nicholas De Prospero is

coordinator Tfor the liturgical as-'

pects of the celebration. Father

William Clancy will deliver the «

homily.

In effect. the entire liturgy of
the day may be regarded as a
transient revival of the Mass form
used prior to the Second Vatican
Council. Both Catholics and
non-Catholics are cordially in-
vited to attend. The ce_lebration
promises to be a rare event in the
life of this University. both aes-

thetically and religiously. ,

Rock Columnist

Readers of Rolling Stone will

no doubt have heard of the fantas-
tic genius of John Ned Mendel-
sohn and his magnificently tal-
ented group. Christopher Milk.
They have supposedly brought
thousands to their fee-t in frene-
tic cheering and are the greatest
thing to come out of Los Ange-
les since. . . . . since. .  . well.
you fill in your favorite group.
. Well. if their first album. Some
People Will Drink Anything, Re-
prise MS 2111 is any indication
of how great this group is or
what L.A. has to offer. maybe
we should all pray for an earth-
quake to wash’ them out to‘sea.

Other than a reasonably in-
teresting cover, this album has
to be one of the worst I’ve wast-
ed $5.00 on in many a year.

The lyrics are all but unintelli-
gible. being drowned out by a
flood of over-loud music. The
only song on the album that is
halfway decent is an up-tempo
version of the Carole King—Ger-
ry Goffin tune. “Locomotlon.“

Other than that. Mr. Mendelsohn
should stick to his journalistic
inclinations and leave the music
for those who can do it.

On the other side of the coin
is Kris Kristofferson‘s latest. Je-
sus Was a Capricorn (Monu-
ment KZ31909). Somehow. Kris
just keeps getting better as he
goes along. He no longer "sounds
like a duck in the shower." as he
used to describe his voice. He‘s
no Marty Balin. but he‘s gettin‘
there.

This new album is a lot more
country-flavored than the others,
yet it’s not the country-sound
that makes one (or me, at least)
want to head for the bathroom-
it’s country-rock-gospel-bluegrass
‘all rolled together in some inde-
finable way to make it good.

Perhaps it's the influence of

‘Rita Coolidge. the Delta Lady
‘who ‘is. currently Kris‘ old lady.

She sings with him on four cuts.
"It Sure Was Love.“ "Help Me.“
“Give it Time to be Tender."
and "Why Me.“ and their voices
blend most melodically.

National Football League’s annual collegiate draft. Both Webster and
Moss were selected in the 12th round late Wednesday afternoon.

The Pitt Wrestling team upped its record closer to the .50
mark Wednesday night by thrashing the Kent State Golden Flashes
by a resoundingscore of -32-11.

The Grapplers are beginning to make a prophet of their coach
Dave Adams, who had predicted his team would improve with ex-
perience. I *

“We are a young team," Adams had noted at the outset of the
current campaign. “We are going to make mistakes that are congru-
ent youth and inexperience, but by tournament time we are going to
be tough.” A - '

Behind the grapplers current surge, which has included victor-
ies in two of their last three meets, ‘ has been the extraordinary per-
formance of John Buzzato in the 150 pound weight-class. Buzzato,
only one of two- seniors in the Pitt lineup, copped his eight conse-
cutive win at Kent State.

Buzzato’s only loss came in the first meet of the season against
the powerful Wolverines of Michigan. He was embarrassed in that
match at thehands of one of the finest wrestlers in the Big Ten.

Buzzato fell to John Hubbard 9-1. Hubbard is’ defending his
Big Ten title in the 150 pound class. Since then, though, Buzzato
has been a ball of fire and seems ready for/ a good performance in
the Easterns.

Carl Roba, at heavyweight, added’ some icing to the Pitt cake-
walk at Kent with a pin in the closing match. Roba pinned Bob
Powleski with? 5:26 gone in the match to add six points to the Pitt
total. The pin marked the third for the grapplers in the last three
meets. Exceptional considering they did not own a pin in the first
six matches. ' ' '

But the highlight of the evening came in the 167vpound match. A
Ray Dallatore managed a draw against Gary Hosta, who had been _,
a Junior College All—American. ’

Dallatore. one of seven Pitt underclassmen in the starting line.-
up, is a highly regarded freshman prospect and considered by Adams
as the best of the frosh. .

The win came to the Cats after a loss to third ranked team in
the East, Clarion State College, 25-14. ' ‘

Actually, the grapplers can_surpass the .500 mark this weekend.

Tankers Tackle Double

Trouble This Weekend

by YAIER LEHRER

The Panther swimmers will travel to Washing-
ton,D. C., today to face American University and
then go on to confront Maryland tomorrow.

American is a good freestyle team but is weak
in most other areas. In the distance events, the,1000
and 500-yard freestyle, they have Steve Pranckus.

In the 50-yard freestyle American swim Bob Bretz.

and Mike Plitman in the 100-yard freestyle. In the

200-yard breaststroke Jose Cortina will provide a

great challenge to the Pitt swimmers.

Cortina also participates in the individual med-
ley and is a tough competitor in that event. The
American freestyle relay consists of. Pranckus,
Bretz, Plitman, and Cortina. I

In the other events, the Pitt team should have
no troubles in taking care of its opponents.

.John Templin should put in a good performance '

and maybe shave the two seconds off of his time in
the 200-yard breaststroke in order to qualify for
the NCAAS. He has already qualified for the 100-
yard breaststroke in the Easter Collegiate Athletic
Conference championships at Army. » '

Mark Wallace, who has qualified for both the
’NCAA’s and the ECAC’s, will not be up against
much competition in the backstroke event, and
with the help of Ed Cahill they should take first and
second places in the event.

The Cats’ medley relay,_consisting of Mark
Wallace, Joyn Templin, Dave Natali, and Dave Si-
meone, should be able to get back onto their winning
ways after last week’s first loss of the season in
this event. '

American posts onelgood diver by ‘the name of '

Mark Johnson who could pose a threat to Jack Gar-
row, Jeff Miller, Martin Staley, and Chuck Baker.

Garrow and Miller have already qualified for the‘

ECACS. W
American is coming into this meet with a 1-3

record, identical to «tha_tj‘ofr‘theCats, but American V '
t. has n.otVswa'm,*;aga'inst t_he,c'aliber‘v_tearnsfthatg.

 

 

has’. This one could be very easily chalked up as a
win for the Cats. >

I The mermen will then travel to Maryland to
meet the Terrapins at 3 p.m. tomorrow afternoon.

The outlook ‘for this meet is not nearly as good‘
as it is for American University. Maryland as a
team is just like Kent State—they are good at every-
thing. Name any event and there is an‘ outstanding
swimmerifrom Maryland who cangive the Pitt mer-

_men quite a run for their money.

Maryland won the Penn State Relays earlier
this season, the meet in which the Cats finished
fifth. » .

Maryland is coming into the meet with ai5-2
record, losing to North Carolina and North Carolina
State. - V

The medley relay team will have a tough time
of it. The last time Pitt’s medley relay faced the
Terrapins the Panthers lost by a very close score.

Some of Maryland’s outstanding swimmers. are
Matt Glenn in the distance freestyle events and Jim
Clifford in the 200-yard freestyle. Gary Weber, who
has qualified for the NCAA’s in diving. will be a

thorn in the side of the Pitt divers who will have to 2

bring in a few places in order to make the meet
close. - '

John Templin will have to swim hard to beat

Maryland’s Scheebler. This event, along with the .

diving and medley relay are the events that the mer-
men should do best in and they will have to win them
to stand anysort of chance against this tough Mary-
land team.

Says Coach Bradshaw, “After the Maryland
meet, we’ll be on our winning ways. This is ayoung
freshman squad and we arestill building. By next
year we should be able to swim against teams like
Kent State and Maryland on an even basis.”

Sports Editor

People who like to see physical basketball would have loved to,

' watch the Pitt-Penn State game last Saturday night at the Pitt. Field

House. Throughout the duration of the contest. which the Cats won.
63-53. Panther forward Mickey Martin and Lion forward Jonathan “Big
Jon” Marshall were operating in near street-fight conditions.

And perhaps. it was one of the main reasons Martin had a good
game.

Martin. a 6‘5". 205 pound junior. has been described by coaches as
“hard nosed.“ "a tough kid." and “willing to fight you." He likes that
and he thinks it makes him play better. W

Marshall -is from the Pittsburgh area. -He played two years under
Gus-Krop at Rbbert Morris College. Martin, a Baldwin graduate, has
had occasion to play against “Big Jon” before. , ,

‘'I’ve played against Jonathan Marshall since I was in the eighth
grade," the 20-year-old Martin disclosed. “We always play this way.
He got me a few times and made me mad. but I got my pieces in._"

In the box score, Martin accounted for 18 points and two rebounds."
while Marshall played one of the finest games by an opponent this year.
scooping up 23 rebounds to complement his 17 points. Marshall was

heavily_relied on by the Nittany Lions as Ron Brown and Randy Meister V I

were -having sub-par games. Meister downed with the flu andshut off
by Lucius Keese wasn‘t much of a factor and Brown was in foul trou-

' ,ble both‘ halves.

Martin, on the other hand, functioned nicely as a backup to Bill
Knight’s 23 points. With everything taken into consideration, it would
be unjust to make one a loser. And anyhow, neither talked like it after-
wards. I ’ -

“I like to drive." Martin said of the manner by which he accumu-
lated a good portion of his points. "I just like to play hardnose. If it’s
(the game) physical, you won’t find me standing in the corner."

To be noted is the fact that even though Martin relies on physical
play. he is the possessor of some fine talent too. He was expected to be
a double-figure scorer for the cagers—he is averaging 12 points a game
presently——and was mentioned as one of the better players in the East.

_In his senior year at Baldwin High School, he was chosen All-State
by both the Associated Press and the United Press International and he
led his team to the WPIAL semi-finals.

So far this season, Martin has tallied 179 points. He has hit 76 of
163 field goals (46 per cent). has canned 23 of 43 free throws (62 per
cent) and has averaged six rebounds. He also contributed 23 assists.

These figures are not overwhelming, but neither are they some-
thing to be scoffed at. Maybe because his team is 7-10 and because he
thinks he is better than the numbers show, Martin is and has been dis-
satisfied with them. A _ I — '

“My/performance has been disappointing outside of a few games’.
I felt good at'Harvard, (led the team in scoring with 25), Mt. Union
(scored 25), Rutgers (17 points and eight rebounds), Bucknell (19
points and 12 rebounds), and against Penn State. — V

“But at other games I just didn’t have the feeling."
By “feeling good"'Mickey means pre-game inspiration.

“I think I’m the kindof player who needs to be pushed. As a fresh-
man coach Grgurich used to yell at me. I hated it, but it made me play
better. Sometimes.I wish one of the coaches would give me a good boot
in the butt.” - -

What soundsflike a rude,’ gesture might be just what the doctor or-
dered for Mickey Martin. I ’ ' 1

When things are going good, however. Martin is at no loss for the-
atrics. He has been known to scream—"whooo“—when open on a fast
break and each of his buckets is followed by raising two fingers in the

' air. sort of like a peace sign. And he points to one of his teammates

everytime he scores.
‘‘I’m just reaffirming the fact that I scored,” Martin said about

, his hand gesture. “And«I like to let everyone in the stands know who fed

me the assist. That’s why you will see me poin_ting to someone.”
One of Martin’s biggest fans is another Martin, his father.

"He comes to all the games," Mickey said, exposing an admir-
able grin. “I remember once, in_ high school he, came to ‘watch me play.
He was in Tennessee on business and flew back to Pittsburgh for the
game and then flew back to Tennessee. He was also at‘North Carolina

After assuring he appreciated his father’s attendance," the blond
haired, blue eyed hoopster made a startling announcement.

"You know,” he said, “we haven’t won two games in a row all
year. If we beat William and Mary, we’ll not only break that spell. but

Ithink we will be able to comeup with a winning year._"
That is, if someone remembers to kick Martin in the d_ressing

room before the game.

Pitt's gymnastic team 'will once again be looking for their first vic-
tory of the season and will have two.chances to do it. as they have two

home matches this weekend.

Tonight the University of Massachusetts comes to town and "to-

morrow night. Slippery Rock
State College pays a visit’ to Oak:
land. -

-Throughout the season. the gym-
nasts have suffered lopsided de-
feats in all of their matches
It will be difficult for the team
to make a turnabout, as the fac-
tors in their being 0-5 have for
the most part, not changed.

While the flu did cause them to '

lose heavily to Springfield and

Southern Connecticut, this was _

not the cause’for earlier defeats.
The flu bug has left the team,
though. -

Lack of depth has ruined the
gymnasts this season. In a sport
where the top three scores in each
event count toward the final
score‘, Pitt has entered only two
men. ‘ e.

The squad is smaller than those
of the competition. and there ob-
viously will be no substantial in-
crease for the rest of this season.

Pitt’s strongest performer is
Dick Pribis, who has managed to
cop a number of first place finish-
es in various events. Dan Camp-
bell also has done well in more
than one event. ‘

But what is ‘lacking is enough
gymnasts_ who can do well in ev-

ery event. the all-around men. As
a result, Pitt enters two or three
men against their oppositionls
four or five. a
The Pitt gymnasts have not giv-
en up, despite the tremendous
odds against a win. Tonight and
tomorrow night at‘ Trees Hall.
those gymnasts that Pitt has will
be doing the best they can. al-
though it may not be enough. ~"

PANTHER STAR Bill Knight tips in shot against Penn State. Knight

ECAC Honors Knight

2‘:

Last week Pitt cager's top All-
American candidate Billy "Moon-
ey" Knight was named the ECAC
(Eastern Collegiate Athletic Con-
ference) basketball star of the
week.

The 6-6 junior forward from
Braddock. Pa.. earned this honor
by benefit of his outstanding per-
formances in the Davidson. Buck-
nell. and Notre Dame contests.

Against Davidson Knight col-
lected a total of 24 points and 11
rebounds. He bettered this show-
ing in the next two games—in the
game with the Bucknell squad
Knight racked up 27 points and 10
rebounds and against Notre Dame
he outdid even this impressive
performance with a strong 33
points and 13 rebounds.

This is the fourth time that the
star Panther has been honored by
the ECAC in this manner. On *
three other occasions last year
Knight was similarly honored.

In last Saturday’s victory
against the Nittany Lions of Penn
State. Knight found himself again
in the spotlight. With the points
he acquired against PSU the Pan-

  Icers Slip By Indiana

/

by BART MACK

Sandwiching one period of outstanding hockey
in between slightly mediocre ones. the Pitt Hockey
Club managed to roll over Indiana. 6-4, Wednesday
‘at the Alpine Ice Chalet. The win keeps the skaters
tied for first place of the City Division of the West‘-
ern Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Hockey Associa-

tion with Carnegie-Mellon.

It took a period before Pitt knew what they had
actually come to the Alpine for. Luckily. Indiana
didn‘t remember too well either. Trailing 1-0. the
icers exploded with four unanswered goals in the
second period to escape what might have been em-

barrassment.

Both teams came out sluggishly and play was ,
ragged from end to end. The hitting was rough but
the Pitt players were being caught out of position
regularly. Pete Hanson put Indiana in front with
only 1:37 left to play in the period. Hanson stickhan-
dled from center ice into the Pitt zone and beat Pitt
goalie Mark Lieberman with a shot from the middle

of the right faceoff circle.

Pitt started the second period shorthanded but
Billy Glanville tied things up, stuffing in the re-
bound of a Phil Clarke breakaway at the 3:52 mark:
Joe Testa found the Indiana defense willing to co-
operate less than three minutes "later when an In-
diana skater fell down at the Pitt blue line. Testa
carried the puck all the way in to beat goalie Gary.

combined with Denny Browne tofeed Phil Clarke
amidst a crowd in front of the net. Clarke lit the
red light with a backhander from 10 feet that went

Browne took the honors with 3:16 left in the ‘
second stanza. Once again it was Glanville helping
out to make the play. The “lush line" accounted for
four of Pitt’s six tallies on the night.‘

With Kerry Browne in the penalty box, Pitt be-I
gan the third period down a man and this time suf-

fered the consequences."The icers managed to keep

Indiana off the scoreboard during the penalty but
‘ Indiana scored with Browne just returning from the
box to the Pitt zone. '

Denriy Browne gave Pitt all the goals needed
only a minute later. Glanville was in alone on: the

extreme left wing and his shot went off Smith’s pads

behind the goal. The speedy center whipped it
around to his linemate. who put the puck past Smith
before he knew what was happening.

It was another breakaway via Dave Bahnson
that put the game away. Bahnson took a pass from
Tom Lang inside his own blueline and broke through
the Indiana defense to walk in alone in the 5:10

mark. Smith came out to cut down the angle but

Bahnson fired it over his shoulder.

From that point on it was Indiana’s game. In
all, Indiana outshot Pitt, 30-27, and were coming on
strong in the final minutes. Even with Pitt on the
.power play, Tim Rearden skated around the Pitt
defense to set up Hansen at the side of the net. With
only 29 seconds left in the game, P/itt ag-ain receiv-

ed the man advantage but literally stopped skating.

Hansen picked up his hat trick, in vain. just sec-
onds before the buzzer sounded with a shot that
went through Lieberman’s pads around the ankle.
Luckily for Pitt. the game wasn't any longer.
