  Pitt Fast-Food BI°.CiSt Questioned Senator Mazzei Ousted,-t

TrusteeSecit Unresolved

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Suspicions clouding the estab-
lishment of a fast-food chain in the
Tuck Shop sparked a ‘meeting
between student leaders and
administrators yesterday in- an
effort to clear up questions on

.4,/“abjdding practices.

Student concerns hinged on the
possible creation of a monopoly of
campus food service.’ One of the
bidding franchisers, Burger Chef,
is owned by the proprietor of the
Uncle Charlie’s Pizza Pub. -

Pete Maggie, the owner of Uncle '
Charlie’s, holds a 50% interest in
the Burger Chef franchise, which is

bidding for the Tuck Shop space.

Director of Housing and Food
Service Tom Albert, who has
handled the program up to now,
said he felt Maggio’s double own-
ership would not be a threat to
competitive pricing on campus.

"‘I’d think the different menus
would attract -different kinds of
people,” Albert said, “and I can’t
really see any problems with
competition. ’ ’

According to Albert, the Univer-
sity is prepared to sink sonie
$175,000 into renovation of the
present Tuckshop; $25,000 of
which already has been spent
pouring a new cement floor.

The only other interest in the
Tuck Shop operation has been on
the part of Burger King franchis-
ers, who were hampered in
preparing their bid because they
received" the speciﬁcations the day
before the bids were due,
according to Dick Peterson, a local
Burger King representative.

University" administrators
plained, that the entire fast-food

later than the target date.
“We can’t afford to lose service

 there-(the Tuck »_Shop area) in
 September.

Service then will be
ultra-critical. ’ ’ ‘
According to Pitt administrators,
the Burger Chef franchise, the
center of the questions, was not
contacted ofﬁcially with a speciﬁ-
cation list for bidding, but
requested one after the lists were

SGB Votesto Support ,
~rcn§Current Visitation Rights '

BY TOM WASELESKI

The continuation of A 24-hour
visitation in the campus dorms was
offered strong support last night by
the Student Government Board
(SGB). The board voted 5-0 on the
motion ' by board member Chi-p
Hubbard.

The vote was the result of a
report to the board given by
Hubbard on memos distributed to
all resident students last weekiby
the Ofﬁce of Residence Life.

In part, the memo reads:
“Recently, a serious question has
arisen concerning the ‘validity’ and
wisdom of the 24-hour visitation
policy, with its attendant security
problems. An in-depth study is
being undertaken by this office, as
well as other offices in the
University, ' to examine the -entire
24-hour visitation policy, with a
look towards revising the over-all
procedure. . . ’ ' .

Hubbard told the «board, “This is
a sneaky thing to do with only a

_thousand students on campus.”
He said the office picked the wrong
time to consider a policy change

-G-"and that “not enough students are

  

around to get feedback on it..”.
He mentioned speaking’ to "onebf
the administrat_ijv'e"-officialsI at
. Residence Life and said -he~'rec'eived
assurances that the office “doesn't
plan" to pass" any policy without first

presenting it to the Resident

Students Association.”

The oard member told the Pitt
News his stand against the
abolition of round-tl 2-clock visita-
tion rests on two asic points:

“One, I don't think they have the -

right to cancel 24-hour visitation,
and two, the time they picked to
pass those leaﬂets out was a poor
one.” Hubbard said students
paying for the rooms should have
rights that go along with them.

, He told the board he volunteered
to be member of the new study
group being formed by Residence

Life for the purpose of scrutinizing . .

the policy.‘ The group has not met
yet and Hubbard said a sampling of
student reaction shows it is against
abolition of the visitation policy.
When "asked if he thought the
office ‘was using_the issue as a scare
tactic to point out. the seriousness
of the dorm security problem,
Hubbard replied, “It may be a
scare, but I would like to take it
seriously now.”
. In other student government

business, the board approved the

Allocations Committee’s recom-
mendation that the Third World
Peoples’ Coalition be granted full
funding,-citing the group’s past
organization of political sympos-
iumsand its plans tohold four
during the coming year. .,

 

ex- '

concept was working under a strict .

September 1 deadline, and that the '

 renovation would be postponed if‘
- there was danger of construction

mailed out.

Student Government (SG) Presi-
dent Larry Platt and SG Repre-
sentative Mary Schwartz attended
yesterday’s meeting and expressed
satisfaction over University coop-
eration with their questions.

“We agreed that if Burger Chef
gets the franchise, they’ have to
document any price hikes, and I-
asked for a survey of other Burger
Chefs in the area so we can see
what other franchises are doing,”
Platt said.

“It’s come down to a situation
where, if we want this thing this
year, we have to act quickly,” Platt
said. »
According to Schwartz, Burger
King, the other fast-food chain in-

. the running for the Tuck Shop area,

was scheduledto make a presenta-
tion to student leaders tomorrow,
with a ﬁnal decision to be made
following the meeting.

The speciﬁcations for a fast-food
chain include nutritional food and

breakfast-lunch-dinner menus,

special services not normally

' offered.

Vice-Chancellor of Budget and
Finance Joseph Dutton defended.
the expenditure "of $175,000 by. the
University as assurance, that Pitt
could cancel contracts with unsat-
isfactory franchises and still retain
equipment to continue service.

Reversing US trend

Local MD's: No

BY KEN GORMLEY
While doctors all. over the
country are walking off the job to
protest rising. premiums for mal-
practice insurance, the Allegheny

County Medical Society is expected

to vote against a strike by local
physicians.

David Moore, the executive
secretary of the Medical Society,
said the majority. of the society’s
executive committee have indica-
ted they will ,not
slowdown or a walkout
Allegheny County physicians.

Moore said the question will be

_ considered tonight by the executive

committee. He said he was
conﬁdent some alternative could be
found to avert a strike.

“We are still hopeful the
legislature in Harrisburg will take
some fairlaction in the. matter,”
Moore said: “If that fails, we will
seriously consider other meas-
ures.”‘ ~

One legislative action Moore
suggested was a ceiling on
malpractice suits that would limit

the amount physicians could be‘

forced to pay if found guilty of
malpractice. If a patient were
awardedmore than the limit, the
state would pay the balance.
With doctors in nearby Bucks
County calling for a state-wide
walkout by physicians, Moore was
not sure if Allegheny County would
have to comply with the Pennsyl-
vania Medical Society’s decision if

 that body called for a- strike by the

state's physicians.
“patients already receiving medi-
cal care will continue to receive
treatment.” Doctors also would be
on hand to treat emergency cases.
Newly appointed Dean, of the Pitt
School of Medicine Dr.-Gerhard
Werner said he had received no

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

State Senator Frank Mazzei was
expelled from ofﬁce ‘yesterday
following a '47-0 vote by -his
colleagues. The action marked the
first time in Pennsylvania history
that a legislator was removed by
the senate.

The 62-year-old South Side
Democrat and member‘ of Pitt’s
Board of Trustees, said he would
ﬁght the expulsion in court but
offered no further comment.

Mazzei, once considered the top
candidate for majority leader, was
sentenced April 11 to ﬁve years in
prison and ﬁned $20,000 for-
extorting political contributions
from BMI, Inc. ‘

Since then, the senator had been
in a "political limbo, excusing
himself from tegislative duty
pending an appeal of his convic-
tion. . . .

Mazzei’s position on the Board of
Trustees still remains in question,
however, according to board
member Sheila’Rathke.  .

“I’ve asked_ about Mazzei’s
status before at meetings,” Rathke
said, “but no ‘one on the board
‘seems to know if we have the power
to remove him.”

/

county medical society of a possible
walkout. ‘ V

Of the more than 1,200 medical
faculty on the Pitt campus, 437 are
full-time faculty members covered
by an institutional «insurance
coverage.» .

Werner said he does not expect a
movement _for ‘ a walkout by -the
full-time faculty, since they. would
not directly feel’ the.-'7 ‘financial
impact of rising malpractice insur-
ance premiums. _

However, the Medical School

dean pointed out that the increased 1

insurance rates are being felt by
the Medical School’s pocketbook.
“I sent in the check for the
malpractice insurance today,”
Werner said. “The rates increased
by 600% over last year.”
.7 Among the 777 Medical ‘School
faculty members not covered by the
institutional insurance plan is
Clinical Assistant Professor of
Surgery Dr. Robert Atwell.
Atwell said even though his
malpractice insurance rates had

Board of Trustees Chairman
_William Rea could not be reached
for comment. In April, on the eve
of Mazzei’s sentencing, Rea said
that because the senator was a

state-appointed member of the "

board, it‘probably would be up to

the Commonwealth to rule on his 1

removal.

“His appointment was made by
the State Senate, and it most likely
would. be up to the State Senate to
remove him,” Rea had noted.

During, April, Republicans and

Democrats wrestled over thevu

Mazzei ousting measure, each side

using parliamentary maneuvers-- 

Republicans seeking an immediate
removal, Democrats trying to hold
off until the outcome of Mazzei’s
appeal. . ‘R

Because the senate had recessed if _
for the month of May, the vote on _
the senator’s removal was post-  

poned until yesterday.

Senate whip Henry .Messingeur,.‘~i‘.u
ﬁlling _in for Democratic leader

Thomas Nolan, who .wa's,,hospi,t_al"-‘ ,‘

ized last week, said theireiwereff

some misgivings over whether the".

senate was following procedure . _’

by the Associated Press.

doubled in the past year--and are

expected to double again in the - V
fall--he would not favor a strike by .
the - I

‘physicians as a solution to
problem. '

“I think that is a pretty absurd 1,

way to handle the problem,” he
insisted. “This should be solved‘

through reasonable channels, such 

to help us out.” '

The assistant professor said he

could foresee no circumstance

under which he would go on strike, . is
since it would only “make the 

problem more acute for people who
need our services.”

- A ‘South Side pediatrician at‘

Children's Hospital, who wished to

withhold his name, said he now is M.‘

paying only $500 for’ malpractice

insurance, but might not be able to ' ' '

tolerate another hike in coverage.

“The public is unaware of the _ E" ‘K

malpractice situation,” he said. .
“The more I think about it, the
more Ithink I would go on strike if
there were another increase.”
