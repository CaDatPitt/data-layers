WASI-I[i\lGTON (LA Tirnes—

‘ \X/ashington Post) - The House‘ yes-

terday rejected a l£700—billion Wall

A stteet bailout thatwould have been

the biggest government interven-

tion in the ﬁnancial system since the ~

Great Depression, sending the stock
market into a sharp downturn and
leaving President Bush’s plan to bail
out the economy in doubt;

The Vote was 205 in favor of the
measure and 228 against The Dow
jonesiindusttial average closed down

3 777.68, the largest one-day point drop

in its history. . ,

The result was a  setback
for the president, who spent much of
the morning — along with Vice Presi-
dent Dick Cheney and Treasury Sec-
retary Henry M. Paulson Jr. — on the

. telephone trying to line up sufficient

Republican support to winpassage

Republicans voted against the Bush
plan by a  of about 2 to 1.
Democrats gave it strong support.

It was a politically excruciatingvote
for lawmakers, whose ofﬁces have
been ﬂooded with calls arid e-mails
overwhelmingly in opposition to the
measure, and it divided lawmakers
from the same 

“This is probablythe toughest vote

any of us has taken since we’ve-been ~_
in Congress,” said Rep. Gary Miller, J

R—Calif. 1

‘‘\While this is‘ not 71929” all 
again, it could be,” said Rep. Ch.tisto— A’
J pher Shays, R-Co’nn., who voted for R

the measure, even thoughhe’s in a

tough race. - ' M t

greed on. W/all Street  ‘ down

don’t intend to.” g 7 7
Democrats who control Congress

balked at supporting the measure un— ,
tilthey were assured at large number i

of Republicans would join them.’
But only approximately one-third

_ of the House Republicans ended up

supporting the bill;

In yesterday's issue of The

incorrectly attributed to
Sarah Vinski. The pho-

_ Pittsburgh police officer Dave
Wright pulled a Taser from the ‘right
side of his holster. -

He pressed the trigger. A little
lightning bolt wavered inside the
gun, and a loud clicking noise jarred
his audience. . C _

The class —_ a group of aver-
age people enrolled in the city police

.department’s Citizens’ Police Acad-

emy —— tensed‘ when Wright turned
on the Taser. _They relaxed as he re-
leased the trigger. T -

Police ofﬁcers use Tasers, among

other weapons, to control someone i

who is not complying with the law
or resisting an officer.
Wright, who teaches about

the use of force at the P09 §\i ..

lice Academy, explained that
Tasers can be used in two dif— ,4’
ferent ways. ii

Normally, when an officer
pulls the trigger, a nitrogen-
based cartridge ejects ,4 two
metal probes at 179 feetper sec-
ond. toward the targeted person.
The probes, connected by wire to
the Taser, attach to his or her skin.
Ideally, one probe reaches the chest
area, and the other about 8 inches
below. An electric shock of about

1,200 volts‘ stimulates’ the body’s_

central nervous system, incapacitat-

‘ ing the person.

An ofﬁcer can also use the Taser
by removing the carnidge that ejects
the probes, as Wright did during his
demonstration. The officer

Wright said this method is

probes, the voltage affects both
sensory (feeling pain) and mo-
tor nerves (ability to move).

Use of force

“It’s a very low statistic o'f offi-
cers who use excessive force,” said
Wright “But those are the ones that
get the press.” ' 4

In August, Swissvale police used

a Taser on Andre ‘ Thomas, who

Tasers and 'use of force'

was allegedly disturbing neighbors’

homes after using cocaine. Police.

arrived at the scene and stunned
Thomas three times. He was taken
to UPMC Braddock and died hours

later, according to an article in the

Pittsburgh Post—Gazette.

, Last week, Allegheny County
medical examiner Karl Williams
said Thomas died of cocaine ir1toxi—
cation, not from the Taser’s shocks. _

However,’ Thomas’ family was
not satisfied, and since, Allegheny
County District Attorney Stephen
Zappala formed a focus group to
address Taser JJSC,‘ according to the
Post-‘Gazette.

Police use the term “use of
force” to describe an effort to get
compliance from an individual.

Support, opposition of $700 billion bailout crosses partylines

Bailout, page 1

called skeptical members of the presidents par-
ty. Deputy White House press secretary Tony
Fratto said they worked one.-by—one through a
list of potentially recalcitrant Republicans, seek—
ing to answer their complaints.

Supporters of the “Emergency Economic
Stabilization Act” sought to portray it as irnpor—
tant to ordinary Americans.

“The economic security of our country is at
risk,” said Rep. Costa,,D—Calif.

The measure would allow the Treasury secre— -

tary to buy bad debts from  ﬁnancial insti-
tutions in an effort to shore up the economy
Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D—Pa., said that he would
return to his district to explain that “\X/e’re not
bailingsomeone out in a farbff place called
Wall Street; \X/e’re  sure that next week
and next month a worker in my hometown of
Nanticoke, Pa, will be able to go to his ATM
machine and draw out money”
Rep. Mel Watt, D—N.C., said he had received
a lot of calls from constituents questioning
whether there is a crisis. But he said, ‘When
the secretary of the Treasury and the chairman

T of the Federal Reserve tell me that there’s a real

problem, the stakes become too high for me
not to take it seriously.

“I am convinced that the odds are bad enough
that if we don’t do something today, we will re-

gret it for a long, long time to come,” he added. i ii

I Supporters of the bill said they had included
measures to protect taxpayers better, including
an opportunity for the government to make
money from the future sale of distressed assets.

But the measure still drew opposition from a
political coalition of liberal Democrats and con-
servative Republicans. »

Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R—Texas, warned that
taxpayers could end up with the “mother of all
debts.” .

“Just because your constituents hate this bill
and will hate it more when they learn the details

. doesinot mean that voting for it is an act of cou-

rageous patriotism,” said Rep. Brad Sherman,

. D—Calif. “Just because this bill is unpopular

doesn’t mean we have to pass it immediately.”

-“Use of force is not black and white. It’s
gray,” he said.

The Fourth Amendment protects citizens
from unreasonable search and seizure. One
example of unreasonable seizure would be ex-
cessive force used by an officer, said Wright.

Police officers are supposed to use a “rea-
sonable force” against noncompliant people
or suspects, and neither minimal not excessive

ll

 

force should be used. Wright said many po-
lice officers hesitate to use deadly force, even
in situations when a court might later deem it
reasonable.

“Human nature is not_to kill another per-
son,” he said. .

An officer is permitted to use force at one
level above the force he or she is resisting. For
instance, if a person is Verbally unvvilling to
cooperate, an officer can use a command and
then act.

“We’re going to do our best to get him to
comply using our verbal skills,” said Wright.

Likewise, if a person uses active aggression
or tries to hurt the officer, rather than simply
using self—defense or running away, an officer
could use deadly force, such as a__handgun,
said Wright. ' ~

He added that many ofﬁcers try not to use
deadly force. He said in 2007, 55 police offi-
cers were murdered in action. Ten were able
to pull out their gun before they were killed,

and 37 were killed in “close rangej’ within a
10-foot radius. This indicates that many of
those officers hesitated to use deadly force
despite being in a lethal combat situation, said
Wright. , , A

“The officer will pull out a Taser when his
gun should be out,” he said. “That’s the hu-
man side.”

. Gray areas

Wright said that Tasers seem to be getting
more coverage in the media. They have actu-
ally decreased both suspect andipolice officer
deaths, even though they get a lot of atten-
tion. '

“Statistically, there’s a lot less injury by
Taser than baton,” said Wright, referencing

said thus far, all medical research on Tasers
has upheld the products safety.

Last year, an Amnesty International study
prompted the group to ask the U.S. Depart-
ment of justice to research the potential risk
of shock devices. They referenced 290 cases
of deaths after Taser shock in the United
States and Canada. ~

A National Institute of Justice report, pub-
lished in June, concluded that no medical re-
search indicates a high risk of serious  or
death caused by Tasers. J __

Although Wright did not comment on the
issue of Tasers in speciﬁc instances, such as
the Andre Thomas case in Swissvale, he said
Tasers make suspects more  to comply.

“There’s something we call ‘compliance
via fear of the Taser,”’ said Wright.

He said Tasers could even save lives.

“We have used a Taser many, many times
to prevent suicide,” he said.

Wiight said the policeiofﬁcers who do use"

excessive force probably get caught up in the
situation.
“Typically, resistance stops and force con-

“That’s a hardthing to‘ teach somebody — to

EDITORIAL
Economic Crisis needs a

thoughtful solution ’ 

i House votes to reject hasty bailout plan

The economy seems to be
in shambles as stock markets

plunge and threats of another_

economic depression loom ever
closer. P

. The House of Representa-
tives rejected President George

 Bush’s $700 billion bailout
 plan Monday in a vote of 228 to
E 205. In all, 140 Democrats and

65 Republicans supported the
bill, and 133 Republicans and
95 Democrats opposed it. The
House vote was a surprising and
momentous defeat for Bush,
who spent much time fervently

pushing members of Congress"

to support the bill.
Both supporters and op-
ponents of the issue present

X important concerns, with sup-

porters sayingthat such a plan
is necessary to prevent an even

bigger economic catastrophe,_

and opponents arguing against a
rushed decision that could put a
large ﬁnancial burden on taxpay
ers. ' -
It’s difficult to gauge, at this
time, which side_ is offering the
more appropriate solution. The
nature of the economy,  its
frequent ups and downs, makes
the right solution almost impos-
sible to come by. ‘_
And the truth is that, at this
point, we simply don’t know
what the suitable response would
be. The many factors involved in
the current crisis_—- from failed
mortgages to fraud — present a
complicated situation, the entire
scope of which is difficult for us
to grasp. ‘

While an impending eco-‘

nomic depression could have

and will take the most respon-

disastrous consequences for col- -

lege students, many of whom
are concerned with paying back
loans and looking for jobs, few
of us. are immediately and di-
rectly affected by the current
crisis. Newspaper headlines and
politicians might warn of a fi-
nancial crisis, but our day-to-day
lives don’t reﬂect any sense of
emergency. We’re still using our
credit cards and still pulling cash’
out of ATMS. Because of this, it
is often tough to clearly see the
signiﬁcance the economic situa-
tion has for our generation and
what is at stake in supporting or
opposing the bill. ,
Nevertheless, the A 'signiﬁ— _
cance and the stakes are great.
And while we might not feel the
economic effects right now, it is
highly likely that we  feel them
in the future.4This crisis could af-.
feet the long—term health of the
economy, making jobs, scarce
and increasing unemployment.
In rejecting the bailout plan, we
trust that the public officials we
elected tothe House took our in-
terests and the interests of other
Americans into consideration

sible route in due course.

For now, perhaps the right
solution to the economic crisis is
no immediate solution. Congress
should take its time and focus on
coming up with a solid bipartisan
plan. At a crucial moment in our
nation’s history —— our economy
is facing its worst crisis since the
Great Depression‘ — it would
be irresponsible to make a hasty
decision that could prove unsuc-
cessful in the future. -n

Ending poverty means ending world conflicts lirst  

by Hayavadhan Thuppal
Culzun/zidt '

At the United Nations General
Assembly last week, UN Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon once again
addressed the importance’ of the
Millennium Development Goals, a
large—scale‘ effort aimed at 
world poverty (and associated prob-
lems like HIV / AIDS and maternal
health) by 2015, to the more than
100 heads of state in attendance.

Unfortunately, with world mar-
-kets in such a precaiious position, it
will be difﬁcult for Ban to convince
representatives to put the troubles of
the worl_cl’s poorest before the prob-

-lems that many of them are seeing
on their respective domestic fronts.

As it stands, many nations,’ espe-

cially those in sub-Saharan Africa,

find it difficult to keep up with the
pace of the goals. Although there
are efforts  made to carry out
the initiatives outlined in the goals,
conﬂicts and weak governments

prevent any significant progress.
Those carrying out these pro-
grams must first look to understand
and eliminate these external stresses
if they hope to make any progress
with the goals. Too often, the ap-
proach of aid organizations has
focused exclusively on treating the

effects" of poverty. But without si-

multaneously dealing with the causes,
conditions can only grow worse. V
And that cause is. War.
Conﬂicts in countiies such as
Afghanistan, Sudanand the Demo-
cratic Republic of Congoihave pre-

M vented any rnajor' developments in

infrastructure, most importantly, in
the health systems. According to
Michael Jay, chair of themedical aid
agency Merlin, in these situations,
more people are dying from mal-
nutiition and disease than by actual

weapons of war. These nations’ fail.

to meet the goals are failing because
of existing conditions. T

Take, for example, southern Su-
dan, a region where 21 years of civil

war has left more than four million

4 people displaced and vulnerable to
, preventable illnesses. Had there been

an opportunity for a health system
to operate, many of these risks could
have been avoided. Furthermore,
the limited amount of “trained health
workers ﬂed, fearing for their safety.
Even after peace treaties were
signed, the effects of war were clear-
ly evident; Hospitals  to recruit
workers were unable to succeed 
a nomadic population that left the
migrating victiriis without the nec-
essary education to work effectively.
To achieve the goals, local popula-

. ' tions must be able to understand and
* administer life—saving proceduresf '

Over the years, southern Sudan
has played host to numerous inter-
national aid organizations. But with
lackadaisical efforts to end the con-
ﬂict on the part of the Sudanese
government, these organizations
continue to stay, as conditions  to
improve .

The ﬁght against global poverty

starts with eliminating the conditions
that allow itlto persist: namely con-
flicts. And preventirig wars is deeply
tied into another one of the MDGS:
sustainable development

Many of todayfs conflicts (Dar-
ﬁir, Democratic Republic of Congo,
Chechnya) are being fought over re-
sources such as oil, and when these
resources become scarce, popula-
tions are easily persuaded to take up
arms to regain a share of what they
see as their own ‘

Food is a major resource at the
center of many conflicts, and hunger

is a major reason why the conflictin

Darfur began. Years of drought
robbed its” people of a sustainable
foodisource and led to aggravations
over resource sharing.

Although other factors were in
play, one cannot ignorethis impor-
tant facet of the situation in Darfur.
And without acknowledging it in any
type of aid or development, the pro-
posed solutions can only be tempo-

rary ones

The Millennium Development
Goals are, as a whole, very ambitious
and can easily. be takenias foolhardy.
The sheer magnitude of what they
are  to achieve might cause
some to throw their hands up in
frustration and deem them impos-
sible. And they will be, unless na-
tions realize that eradicating poverty
will take much more than providing
food and monetary aid.

Each goal that was set up by the
United Nations is deeply connected

to other goals as well as outside is— .

sues. Ending poverty (and the prob-
lems which accompany it) relies on
ending conflicts, which initum de-
pends heavily on the principles of
sustainable development The soon-
er we realize that poverty is a web of

many interconnected problems that i

cannot be separated, the sooner we
will actually be able to combat them.

Stravvberryluna stumbles into success

G

Local artist creates A
posters for indie bands

by Samantha Stahl
Staﬂ lVI'l,'['€I‘

Poster artist Allison Glanc-
ey’s client list reads like a cool
kid’s iPod — Tegan and Sara,
The National, Band of Horses,

Rilo Kiley, .Of Montreal, My-

Morning Jacket — just to name
a few. A .

Glancey, who goes by the
name “Strawberryluna” in the

poster world and is a Pitt alum- —

na, has the joyful vibe of some-
one who loves what she does.
With suchi%2i* repertoire, who
wouldn’t? j
Artist Image Resource, lo-
cated on the North Shore, is a_
nonproﬁt community print cen-
ter — and also where Glancey
creates her posters.  S
The paint—splattered , studio
is Gl.ancey’s home away from
home. Upstairs, out of ‘ the
comfort of air conditioning,
is where the magic happens.
Stacks of paper, paint cans and

screens fill the shelves, and the I

walls are covered with pieces
from various AIR artists,

“You never know what you’re

going to see here. A print will be
hanging for a few months, and
one day it’s gone. Something
new is hung up,” said Glancey.
A large rack of squeegees
— a tool used to push paint
through the silk screens ——
hangs on one wall. _
Glancey motions to’ them,
“It’s rumored that some of
those were actually from Andy

,Warhol’s factory. It’s so cool.

I’ll be printing and think, ‘Who
used this before me?”’

While perusing a poster art,

Web site, Glancey, who moved
from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh

in 1994, came across a recom-
mendation for AIR. She quick-
ly headed over and met Mike
Buda, the man responsible for
the only print training she’s ever
received.

Glancey’s ,original career
plan didn’t include poster art.
“I always thought poster art was
cool. I really liked propaganda
art  but I wanted to be a writer.
Everyonein my family was su-
per artistic, but I clouldnlt paint.
I thought that was the only kind
of art form out there.” A _,

Glancey received a degree
in children’s literature from‘Pitt
but remained unsure about what

_she wanted to pursue.

“I think so often you’re ex-

pectedvto know what you want

to do and what to feel. That’s

never" the way it was for me. I,

didn’t know.”
It’s.hard to imagine being

_ a thriving artist without any

technical training. Sometimes
Glancey can’t believe it herself.

She attributes her success to‘

happenstance. .

“It feels like apdream because .

I never planned it. I didn’-t con-
sciously try. I just kind of fell
down a cliff, and here I am,” she
said. i ‘ ‘

Glancey worked in human '

resources as her casual print

work started catching eyes. In A
April of 2005, fellow artist Dave '

Mayer -approached her to do a
poster for the band Garbage.
“I' got this opportunity and

. thought I’d be an idiot not to. It”

was terrifying just to get through
it, but it was magical,” she said.
The rest is history. Glancey
got hooked on making posters,
which catapulted her to her suc-
cess. _ '

"Miracle at St. Anna"

Starring: Derek Luke and
Michael Ealy '
Directed by: Spike Lee
Studio: Touchstone Pictures

, Can Spike Lee make a movie
centered on- both racism and World
War II?

The answer is no, but not_ for lack
of 

Lee’s new movie, “Miracle at St.
Anna,” had the ingredients to be a

’ masterpiece, with an interesting plot

   

and an allfstar cast toback it. Maybe
the topic of  and the issue of
racism were just too colossal for Lee
to combine the two into one pic-
ture. , c A I ,
‘ ' acle at St; Anna” lacked in-
teresting characters and confused
viewers with contrived use of ﬂash-
backs. . j - «
"‘l\/Iiracle at St. Anna” is about
four soldiers of the 92”“ Infantry Di-
vision — a completely black unit ——

\

The four take shelter in a small

Tuscan towri where, at ﬁrst, they are
ostracized for their race. But they
soon ﬁnd that it isn’t their race that
thejfre hated for. They discover later
in the ﬁlm that they areunwelcome
because they are Americans intrud-
ing on fascism. I

Actors Michael Ealy (“2 Fast 2
Furious”), La; Alonso (“Jarhead”),
Omar Benson Miller (“8 Mile” and
“Get Rich or Die Tryin”—’) and Derek

Luke play the soldiers stuck in the t

Italianyillage. .

Their characters were too “stereo-
typical to bring any real individuality
to the ﬁlm. Ealy played a womanizer

and aggressive badass while 

role was at the opposite end 'ofj.'the
spectrum, a fat,  man with a
true heart Alonso and Luke’s char-

‘ acters were so similar, that they be?

. The simplicity isn’t ‘just limited
to the freedom ﬁghters. The towns-
people are spiteful of the Americans,

' but slowly warm up to them through

dinners, religious get—togethers' and

e risky for studios

by Tom VanBuren‘
Se/uior Staff W/rite/'

 

The theory of laissez—faire government is
one We all learnabout in history class — could
it be that Hollywood needs a good lesson in it,
too? . ,

This, weekend saw the trailer premiere for
“The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” the
latest from “Fight Club” director David Finch-
er. The trailer for the movie ’—- about a man
who is born as a tiny geriatric and ages back-
ward —— is as promising as trailers get.

A moody, understated tone, near—ﬂawless
special. effects, positive test—screening reports

_ and the combined star power of Brad Pitt and _
c Cate Blanchett suggest that it will be ripe and

ready for its awards—season holiday release date

Internet rumors persist, however, that Para-

mount Pictures wants Fincher to tighten up the

running time. /

. t’s a  story for Fincher, who faced
similar pressure during production of his pe-
riod crime thriller “Zodiac,” prompting him to
re-release" the ﬁlm in a director’s cut earlier this
year. It was another Paramount ﬁlm, shot as the
ﬁrst.in a two—picture deal with “Benjamin But-
ton” as the second. " I

Is it fair for Paramount to try  the
‘shots? Well,  and no. Unfortunately for
Fincher, this isthe problem inherent in the high
stakes business of  Whilela director
deserves creative freedom, the studio is gam-
bling millions on  vision. As is the case with
“Benjamin Button?’ a $150 million dollar movie
can’t just be an artistic endeavor —.it needs to
be a marketable product I

‘ ‘ . Case in point: Spike jonze, director and

oddball, worked for years on an adaptation of

A the award—winning Children’s book, “Where the
‘ Wild  Are” Test audiences reported that’

the _ﬁ1m was melancholy with subtle and chal-

lenging themes. Warner Brothers, undoubtedly

expecting a family—f1iendly ﬂick populated by
characters that would look great as plush toys,
sawithat it was sitting on an $80 million piece of
art house cinema for kids. Whoops!

After canceling the release date, it consid-
ered massive reshoots (massive to the point of
scrapping everything and starting from scratch),
recasting, even possibly removing Jonze from
the project When Internet petitions decrying
the bastardization of art started popping up,
Warner Bros appeared to quietly cave in and
give the ﬁlm a “new” release date.— the same
one it had originally occupied,  specu-
lators tosuggest that the reshoots were can-
celled. I

But what of “Benjamin Button?” WIH
Fincher lose to the studio, or will ‘Paramount
back off? Does a swarm of idealistic Internet
ﬁlm nerdsineed to come to the rescue of every
director who may be forced to compromise his
artistic vision? A .

That’s a hard judgment to make —.— 
ﬁlm is an art, and creative ﬁeedom is necessity,
but if movies don’t turn a proﬁt, they aren’t
made

What I can suggest is this: Hollywood pro-

ducers need to know what they’re getting into
_ when they hire their directors. If you want vanil-
. la family fare, hire Chris Columbus, not the guy

who directed “Being John Malkovich.” Same

for Fincher -7- both he and Jonze are known .

for their individual styles, and their shared ex-
perience as music video directors might have

spoiled them on  free artistic reign over

their own projects. Don’t hire an unconvention-
al director and expect a predictable product.
On the other hand, studios still need to ex-

ercise a little caution, even when it comes to’

reliable directors — after all, Universal Studios

let Peter Jackson completely off the leash. after.

the success of the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy,
and all he gave them in return was three hours
of - Naomi Watts  for a giant, dinosaur:

Company’s double—header lab
production of “Middle Aged
\X/hite Guys” and “The Complete
Works of \William Shakespeare
Abridged.”

“Middle Aged \X/hite Guys,” a
comedy by Jane Martin, provokes
both thoughts and laughs. The
story takes place amid a beer can-

high school baseball field.

The plot focuses on three

V aging brothers, Moon, Roy and

Clem, the woman they all loved,

R.V., and the theory that Cauca-
sian males of a certain age are
responsible for the world going
to hell through their various of-
fenses, screwups and general mis-
handlings of affairs. P

On the site of an almost—mi—
raculous nearly no-hitter baseball
game decades past, the brothers

are gathered together to remem-

ber Moon’s high school. sweet-
heart, Roy’s first wife and Clern’s
lifelong crush — all the same
woman — on the anniversary of
her suicide. To their great shock,
the ghost of R.V. appears with a
message from the afterlife. But it
isn’t until Elvis, self proclaimed
“King of the \White Men” shows
up that things get really weird.
PittsophomoreHenryBrinker—
hoff’s excellent portrayal of Roy,

a mayor with questionable mor—,..

als and deﬁnitionsiof patriotism,

was well complemented by the ’

other actors. Senior John Fallon
played the role of the simple but
well—intentioned Clem,’ and soph-

omore John Jameson played the _

youngest brother Moon, a Viet-
nam vet and soldier of fortune.
Elise D’Avella, a Pittisophomore,
was mesmerizing as R.V., bring-
ing passion and evangelical—esque
fervor to her monologues.

Pitt sophomore Dylan Ger-
inger’s double turn as Roy’s stut-
tering homicidal wife Mona and

“Okkervil River e—mailed me, and I
was like, ‘Holy crap! How do you even
know I exist?’ I still get those ‘what’s go-
ing on here?’- moments. They never get
old,” said Glancey.

Sometimes, however, the chance to
work forfavorite bands is intimidating.

“It’s hard to do posters for artists
you’ve liked for a really long time. You
kind of choke under the pressure,” she
explained.

So where does the inspiration for
these posters originate?

“I try to work from lyrics without be-
ing too obvious. I’ll_ylisten to a song and
see pictures.” I I

A Spoon poster hangs on the wall. It
has an eerie quality to it — a few sets
of glowing eyes peer out from a _thickly
wooded forest.

“Sometimes I match up the poster to
the season of the concert,” said Glancey.
“That one was in October. Fall is my fa-
vorite.” ‘

Glancey appreciates the opportunity
to put her creative eye to use.

“It’s rare in this industry to have so
much freedom,” she said of the com-
mands artists usually. get from clients.

“Some of them will tell you what song
to work with. Or they’ll say, ‘I deﬁnitely
want a skull.’ But most are pretty open.”

In this digital age, it’s nice to see ef-
fort go into something handmade. After

’ ‘receiving an assignment and creating a

sketch, Glancey creates the ﬁnalized im-
age on the computer. The blueprint is
printed out and transferred to screens
before actual printing begins.

“The worst part of my job is when
printing isn’t going well, but I have a
deadline in nine hours,” said Glancey.

It’s easy to see how she could get frus-
trated. A job usually consists of around
100 posters — each layer of color done
by hand. A three—color poster requires
approximately 15 hours of work.

“I used to give up easily, but this has
taught me perseverance. In printing, mis-
takes can always be ﬁxed,” she said.

To those looking to pursue a creative
career like Glancey’s, she says: “It’s way
possible. Find your niche. Get used to
feeling anxious and nervous all the time.
It’s easy to limit yourself and think, ‘I
can’t do this,’ but you have to just go for
it and dive in.”

Students interested in learning about
printmaking can visit AIR on Tuesday
nights for open studio. For a few dollars,
you’ll get lessons and be able to create
your ﬁrst print by the end of the night.

DePaul 1, Pitt 0
The Panthers continued their competi-

tive Big East campaign against DePaul in i

Chicago Sunday afternoon. _

Pitt fell to the'Blue Demons as junior
defender Erich Reichmann scored the only
goal of the game in the 64th minute, put-
ting it past senior goalkeeper Eric Barnes.

Once again, Pitt struggled to create op-
portunities on offense, registering only one
_shot on goal for the second consecutive
game.

, Overall, Pitt was outshot 11-6, and 4-1
with shots on goal.

-Luxbacher said despite losing the games,
Barnes has been solid. '

“I’ve really been impressed with our
goalkeeper’s play this year,” said Luxbacher
of Barnes, who has only allowed six goals
in 10 games this season and hasn’t given up

’more than one goal in a single game.
“The effort is there, no_question about

it,” he added. Luxbacher also stressed the

importance of creating mot? offensive op— _

portunities for the team.

The loss dropped Pitt to 5-4-1 overall
and 1-3 in the Big East.

Pitt’s schedule won’t get any easier. The
team will face a tough Marquette team at
Founders Field Sunday.

Marquette is coming off a 2.—1 defeat

against No. 3-ranked Notre Dame. The
Panthers will then travel to Morgantown
next Wednesday night for a showdown
against archrival West Virginia.

“It’s going to be ‘an extremely intense
