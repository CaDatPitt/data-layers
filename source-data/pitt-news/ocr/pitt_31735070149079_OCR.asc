Panthers sink Pirates’ shp with late rally

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

In the same city where the_pro-
fessional baseball Pirates have
suffered 20 consecutive losing
seasons, another set of Pirates ex-
perienced a similar fate on Monday
night.

The Pitt men’s basketball team
outlasted the Seton Hall Pirates
(13-10, 2-8 Big East) by a score
of 56-46 in a scrappy contest at
the Petersen Events Center that
showed that the No. 23 Panthers
(20-5, 8-4 Big East) still have room
to improve. ,_

Despite the worst offensive

shooting performance of the sea- '

son from Pitt —- the Panthers con-
verted only 34.8 percent of their
ﬁeld-goal attempts — head coach
Jamie Dixon believes that it was

i still a solid victory for his team.

“There’s not a lot of teams with
19 wins in the country,” Dixon said
following the game. “You’re not
going to win every game the same
way. This is a good win.”

Coming off an impressive win
over No. 6 Syracuse on Saturday,
the game began well for Dixon’s
squad as the Panthers jumped out
to a 6-0 lead thanks to back-to-
back 3-pointers by redshirt junior
small forward Lamar Patterson.

P But following the solid start,
the home team struggled to ﬁnd
any offensive rhythm, turning the
ball over three times and hoisting
up several out—of-sync 3-pointers.

The Pirates couldn’t capitalize
on the Panthers’ dry spell, shoot-
ing 2—for-12 from the ﬁeld to begin
the game. In a battle ﬁlled with
early fouls, Seton Hall did take
advantage of its free-throw op-
portunities to tie the game at 12.

Corbett to reveal budget today

ffig/767* education tzppropriatiom to beﬂatﬁmo/m’

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

Though it’s not certain how he
plans to handle other areas of the
state funding, Gov. Tom Corbett
has committed to keep funding
forvhigher education ﬂat when he

~ presents his annual budget ad-

dress at 11:30 a.m. today.

On Feb. 1, Corbett announced
that the budget for ﬁscal year
2013-2014 will include $1.58 bil-
lion in funding for higher educa-
tion. This amount will include
ﬂat funding for the state-related
universities —- Pitt, Penn State
University, Temple University, and
Lincoln University. The governor’s
budget address is also expected

l3Pi;iC rezrusters  career Deveiapment 8: Ptacereent /assistance staff wit! be an site‘

to include information about his
planto privatize Pennsylvania’s
liquor stores, the uncapping of a
state tax on gasoline and his plan
to reduce state pensions.

Last year, the state appropri-
ated $136 million for Pitt, and Cor-
bett will propose that the Univer-
sity receive that same amount next
year. But Corbett’s decision to ﬂat
fund higher education this year
still doesn’t repair damage done
from previous cuts. This year’s
expected state appropriation is
19 percent lower than the $168
million Pitt received just three
years ago and comes after large
proposed cuts in 2011 and 2012.
Last year, Corbett proposed a 30
percent cut to Pitt’s appropria-

 

tions before restoring funding to
the 2011 level of $136 million. In
2011, Corbett proposed a 50 per-
cent cut to Pitt’s state funding,
and the state ended up cutting 19
percent of Pitt’s budget.

After last year’s ﬂat funding,
the University saw a 3 percent tu-
ition increase for the 2012-2013
academic year. With ﬂat funding
proposed once again, it’s possible
the University will see another in-
crease.

In addition to higher-education
cuts, recent years also saw drastic
reductions in funding to public-
school education. After slashing

Student gets an early start in music business

Fres/aman Sam Conturo create: my own recording company to pursue dreams of musical ﬁzme

Cassidy Davis
Staﬁ’ Writer

Despite living in Litchﬁeld Tower C without
a roommate, freshman engineering major
Sam Conturo certainly isn’t lonely.
Conturo, a freshman engineering ma-
jor, took interest in music at a young age.
After opening a recording company called
HOD Music with a live video and sound

studio in his Highland Park home, Conturo C
has maintained his business after moving

down Fifth Avenue to Litchﬁeld Tower C.
He has become a well-known local pro-
ducer in Pittsburgh and has worked with
a number of local recording artists.

He created his recording company,
HOD Music —— which stands for hard work,
originality and dedication —— by download—
ing recorded songs and using his brother’s
beat-making software.

Conturo’s Tower C neighbors have said
that beats are always pumping from his
room, and he is known as the musician
on the ﬂoor.

“No neighbors have complained. Ev-
eryone on floor 3 of Tower C is great,”
Conturo said.

His next-door neighbor, Larry Law, a
freshman and computer science major,
said that he enjoys listening to.Conturo’s
music. -

“All the artists he brings in are really
nice. They always come in and say hi,”
Law said. '

Beginnings

It all started with a school project in
his ninth grade English class at the Barack
Obama Academy of International Studies,
a magnet school located in the Highland
Park neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Conturo
said that both he and a friend were in dan-
ger of failing the class, and there was an
extra credit assignment that offered the
option of either writing a poem or a song.

 Conturo asked his teacher if he could

record a real rap song. After getting per-
mission, Conturo and his friend, Raihoz
.“Trell”]ohnson, created a rap about Shake-
speare. ‘ . .
« L ; “It was real goofy, but the teacher said
itiwas amazing and that she was going
to show the rest of her students, which
kind of saved us ‘cause we both passed the
class,” Conturo said. ' c r

1 Soon after, his passion for music began.
C  Conturo said he began his music pro-

duction business using cheap materials.
Originally, he used intercom system mi-
crophones. Then, as his friends asked for
more and more projects, it started getting
serious. ‘

Johnson and Conturo continued mak-
ing raps throughout their years in high
school because it got them through a lot of
classes. By the time they graduated, they
had made raps for English, chemistry and
history classes.

At the end of ninth grade, two more
friends joined them. Myron “Woo” Taylor
and Mike “Mikey P” Peterson, both cur-
rently studying at Penn State University-
Greater Allegheny, worked with Conturo
andjohnson on projects, especially during
the summer. e

. By the beginning of 1_0th grade, they
had made their ﬁrst CD, titled “Killin’
Spree.” Conturo said that it didn’t sound

very good, but that they were still experi- .

menting with their equipment.

“It was gangster stuff that wasn’t really
our style but was popular then,” Conturo
said. '

Conturo added that his friends rapped,
but he enjoys making the beats and produc-
ing the music because he has an ear for it.

By the end of 10th grade, he was charg-
ing clients to record with him. He charges
a low rate of $20 an hour,'in comparison
to professionals, who charge anywhere
from $50 to $100 an hour. He also sells
his beats to artists for anywhere from $30
to $150 depending on how good they are.

“I’m really into smooth beats that you
can just play in thecar and drive around-
to,” Conturo said.

a Johnson, a 19-year-old freshman at the C

Community College of Allegheny County,
has been working with Conturo since
2008, when Conturo decided to turn his
passion into HOD Music. Conturo and
Johnson used to live on the same street
in the Highland Park neighborhood of
Pittsburgh, so they would work together
about two or three times aweek as Conturo
produced and Johnson rapped. Now that

Conturo has moved away to Pitt, it’s be—- I

come a bit more difficult. However, they’vei

refused to give up doing what they love, '
even though it’s a little harder now that’, 5‘  :

they’re separated. 1 ~ .

in Highland Park. He mostly works with
underground rappers to give them an op-
portunity to get their music out. His music,
both what he produces and. his own mixes,
are mostly rap, pop and some R&B. Other

than the members in his group at HOD,
he has worked with local artists such as ,

CDOM, Styxx and Errol. ~

‘Getting into the familybusiness

when it comes to producing music, also
referred to as audio engineering, Conturo-
followed in his brother’s'footsteps. -

Conturo said.
His brother, Billy Conturo, a live sound

‘engineer in Pittsburgh, said that they both,

got into music after getting musical instru-
ments for Christmas one year. ’
“Music has been a big part of our family

 for a while,” Billy said.
+z>«;r<*r"<f*Billy said that if his younger brother can
make a big recording with a fewpopular

artists, that will lead him to success.

“I hope he doesn’t stop working on it,” 
Billy said. “If he really likes to do it, and he p H

wants to do it, then I guess he should do it.”
Conturo learned from his brother and

\ other live sound engineers by listening

to their music and hearing what sounded
right. It took some getting used to, but he
said he improves every time.

“I close my eyes and listen to the song,
and move the volumeof the instruments
to where you want them to be,’-’vConturo

vi said. “It’s just a lot of listening and trying

to get it the way you are envisioning it.”

He said the trick he has yet to master is
getting the sound to surround you as you
listen to it, so when you close your eyes, it
seems like a symphony is in front of you.
He said this is an ability that separates an
amateur from a professional.

Conturo said the hardest part about his

V job is working with people.

“Everyone is unreliable except for your
close friends,” Conturo said.

His favorite part of producing is the ‘

ﬁnished product. He enjoys sitting back
and listening to the music.

. “I go for a drive and play through the
whole CD,” Conturo said.

Spreading the word

At this point, Conturo’ has created about
1,000 beats, and produced 11 or 12 CDs.
He has around 200 or 300 tracks either
released or about to be released. Nearly
100 of those have his own beats in them,
while the others are industry beats that
are already made and known or beats from
other artists. '

- V 1 He also wants to make “classier music”
. and move toward a more laidback product._

3; “You need to have some elegant music

 you can play at parties,” Conturo said.

 Conturo is trying to expand HOD with
liis YouTube page, HODTV412.
 He has just started doingvideo produc-

’ ‘tion and has about ﬁve orsix videos re-
 leased, with three or four more on the way.
“There was a lot of trial and error,”

His ehildhood friend, Connor Claussen,
whom he refers to as his little brother, is

1’ a freshman in high school at Pittsburgh

Obama and has also helped him a lot with

the videos.‘-‘The video conveys the emotion
’ of the song through images,” Conturo said. ’

Conturo is alsotrying to jump start
a clothing line titled HOD Clothing. He
hopes to promote local artists by buying
their graphics and putting them on shirts.
This would ideally help both Conturo and

MUSIC  

Some of God’s Children Gospel Choir,
Taylor Montague, worked together to
bring this event to campus.

“First of all, it’s Black History Month,
which is a really big deal for us. This
year, we really want to bring awareness
to campus about all the events going on,”
Hobbs said. .

The event consisted of a presenta-
tion during which speakers discussed the
evolution of song throughout the black
church experience —— from enslavement
to the civil rights period to the modern
church.

Before the choir began its rousing per-
formance of “Wade in the Water,” one
choir member explained that the song
contained secret messages for slaves
looking to escape from the plantation,
encouraging them to travel by water
rather than by land.

Next, the choir sang “We Shall Over-
come” to represent the civil rights period,
during which the churches were a point
of mobilization. This song became a mes—
sage of protest during that era.

The Anointed Steps of Faith followed
the choir. After using various film clips
to explain the evolution of step from
gumboot dancing in the gold mines of
South Africa to the hambone step in the
enslaved South, the group presented a
short step dance with a message of praise.

Montague said the presentations were
important because they help students
grasp a greater understanding of African-
American history and culture.

“It was important for us to hold this
event because one, we’re young college
students [and] two, I think it’s impor-
tant to show the history of why black
spirituals were formed and how they were

formed and their significance and how_

they impacted the church,” Montague
said.

She also shared how song has influ-
enced her time in the church.

“It’s definitely inﬂuenced my expe-
rience, because I sing, as well, in and
outside of the church and its a great form
of worship for me,” she said.
Hobbs added her thoughts on how

dance has inﬂuenced her time bothinside‘

and outside the church.

“We did one or two praise dances‘ in
the 15 years I was in that church, and I
always loved stepping but I didn’t get to
do it in the church,” Hobbs said. “When

I came to Pitt and Ifound out there was a
group dedicated to stepping and ministry,
I decided to join. I’ve been amember for
four years and this is my fourth year.”

major, came to the event because she’

BUDGET  

2011 and providing ﬂat funding for public
schools in 2012, the governor has indicated
in recent press appearances that this year’s
budget will include two major proposals
to open avenues of increased funding for
education.

The ﬁrst is the privatization of liquor .

stores in Pennsylvania. Corbett’s plan in-
volves selling off the currently state—owned
liquor stores for a total revenue of $1 billion.
The proﬁt from the liquor stores salejwill

then be used to fund different aspects of '

public education —— notably school safety,
STEM programs and early-childhood educa-
tion — through block grants.
“Pennsylvania and Utah are the only two
states in the country who have fully state-'
controlled liquor systems,” Corbett said at
a press conference in Scranton, Pa., on Feb.

1. “Our plan sells boththe wholesale and 

retail arms of the state-run liquor business.”

The second expected proposal from Cor-
bett today is shrouded in more secrecy. The
governor has m'ade it clear that he plans to
propose a solution to the state’s oversized
pension plan for state employees and public-
school workers.

“When you don’t have the money, you

can’t have the pension plans continue to take’

so much out of the taxpayers’ pocket,” Cor-
bett told the Associated Press in November.

In 2001, then—Pennsylvania Gov. Tom
Ridge passed a budget that allowed for a
nearly 50 percent increaseiin pensions for
public employees. More than a decade later,
the state is feeling the effects of that original
increase and now ﬁnds itself strapped to
pay a $403.1 million increase in pensions,
expected this coming ﬁscal year. 

Without any action taken to reduce the
pension costs, the jump will bring the total
cost for pensions in ﬁscal year 2013-2014
to $1.26 billion. While Corbett is expected
to announce a plan to slash these pension
costs, it’s unclear precisely what that plan
will be. ’ j

The state employs around 300,000 em-
ployees and school teachers. Members of the
Pennsylvania State Education Association
have already made clear their intention to
ﬁght any proposed pension cuts.

“To blame Pennsylvania’s budget prob-
lems on debts employers owe to the pension
systems is to make a scapegoat of working
people who have contributed to their pen-
sions — year in and year out,” PSEA Presi-
dent Mike Crossey said in a press release.
“It was employers that paid nearly nothing
into the pension systems for a decade.”

Corbett indicated to the Philadelphia In-
quirer injanuary, though, that if his agenda.
to reduce pension plans doesn’t take in the
state legislature, other areas of the budget
now assumed safe could be cut.

Corbett also made clear at ajan. 24 press
conference that he plans to propose a po-
tential increase in taxation on gas stations.

e Currently, the amount the state can tax gas

stations on the wholesale price of gasoline
is capped at $1.25 per gallon. Corbett has

February 5, 2018 I The Pitt News I v\A/wv.pii‘mevvs.eom

indicated that he plans to uncap this tax to
allow for its increase.

It’s estimated that such a move could
generate around $2 billion. Corbett and
his budget secretary, Charles Zogby, -have
hinted that $2 billion could go toward the
funding of transportation. Many legislators
have pressed the governor in recent months
to free up money for the funding of road and
bridge repairs and to support mass transit
operations. A, I ' -

In the future, Conturo hopes to be a

“I want to be able to have that power

Online privacy through encryption
worth risk of potential abuse

Tiemoko Ballo
Columnist

Onjan. 20 — exactly one year after
the controversial FBI shutdown of
ﬁle-hosting service Megaupload
—— Internet entrepreneur Kim Dot-
com made a comeback with Mega:
a cloud storage and ﬁle sharing ser-
vice that promises complete pri-

I vacy through encryption. At Mega’s

launch conference, Dotcom stated
that “the Internet belongs to no
man or industry or government,”
and that “privacy is a basic human
right,” casting Mega as an attempt
to uphold Internet freedom and
protect personal privacy. But is
Mega really a big step forward for
human rights in a digital world? Or
is it simply a more sophisticated
architecture for piracy and crime?

To understand why Mega pro-
tects privacy, you have to under-
stand the basics of Mega’s encryp-
tion scheme. Encryption is the use
of recursive computational algo-
rithms for encoding data, making
it nearly impossible for someone
to read a ﬁle without a special de-

cryption key. Mega protects your
data with two well-known methods
of encryption. Before a ﬁle is up-

loaded, it’s encrypted with a 128- A

bit Advanced Encryption Standard

So should

our right,
to pnvacy
in favor of

Absolutely
not.

key, and 2048-bit RSA key pairs are
used for sharing a ﬁle. The genera-
tion of keys is pseudorandom and
based on your password, which
Mega does not actually store.

There is no way to recover a lost
password, but more importantly
there is no way for Mega to decrypt
your data.

Mega keeps itself — and you
-— out of legal trouble because the
company cannot monitor uploaded
content. No third party can. En-
cryption ensures that you and the
person you share a ﬁle with are
the only individuals on earth who
know what that ﬁle contains.

Being able to upload, download
and share content without fear of
monitoring or repercussion is es-
sential to a free Internet. Program-
mer‘ and activist Aaron Swartz was
facing thirteen felony charges for
his illegal download of academic
journal articles when he commit-
ted suicide onjan. 11. Swartz was a
well-known proponent of Internet
freedom and some see him as a
martyr for the same ideals Mega
aims to uphold.

That’s not to say that adults are uncreative
people. They create novels, make movies,
sing songs and write fan ﬁction that be-
come terrible novels (cheers to you, “Fifty'
Shades”). Adults are awesomely creative, but
it’s time to take it to the next level and get
more people involved. Not everyone has the
skill, time or talent to create novels, poetry or
music, but everyone can beneﬁt from some
imagination and creativity in theirlives.

a couple of them. -

“I would do a Saturday Night Live LARP,”
said’Melody Kessler, a sophomore chemistry
major. This LARP would focus more on snap-
py comebacks and comedic roleplaying than
jabbing one another with foam swords — a
feature that many LARP scenarios employ.

Beth Farris, an undeclared freshman,
suggested naval combat LARPing. This idea
involves participants in canoes or fowboats
with the goal of sinking the opponent’s ship
ﬁrst. Farris suggested that water balloons

could be used as “special disease bombs,
speciﬁcally dysentery and scurvy” to recre-
ate the authenticity of early naval battles.
Although Farris may enjoy a real-life Bat-
tleship game, I’m not sure all people would,
which is why I think it’s important to create
LARPs that speciﬁcally target other subcul-
tures in order to ensure mass participation.
I think we should introduce a Twilight
LARP in which players rub glitter all over
their skin and spy on each other while they’re
sleeping. If you wanted to make it into a com-
petition, see who can stop an oncoming car
with only their hands or maintain a smolder-

_ ing gaze the longest.

Or why not a “Pretty Little Liars” or “Gos-
sip Girl”-themed LARP? Although girls with
impeccable fashion taste who text all the time
aren’t very different from reality, I think we
could spice it up by adding other ﬁctional
characters into the mix. Blair Waldorf of
“Gossip Girl” and Sheldon Cooper of “The
Big Bang Theory” at the same party? Now
we’re talking.

I don’t expect the LARPing fad to catch
on immediately, but with enough promotion
and involvement at a young age, I think this
campaign could go somewhere. _

After a photo of President Obama pre-
tending to be caught in a web by a kid dressed
as Spiderman went viral a month ago, I think
we already have our perfect pro-LARPing
campaign photo. All we need to do nowlis
alter his “change we can believe in” slogan to
“LARP we can (make) believe in,” and then I
think our success is guaranteed. I

necessary to protect individuals. Privacy
through encryption, however, has a serious
tradeoff: It cripples law enforcement’s abil-
ity to detect and respond to illegal activity.
This does not just mean it will be harder to
crack down on Internet piracy, although
that’s certainly the case. The repercussions
of encrypted ﬁle sharing on this scale extend
far past the spread of copyrighted digital

media. Consider what would happen if Mega
became a safe haven and new distribution
tool for child pornography. Mega itself has
no way of stopping the upload and sharing
of videos that abuse children, and neither do
authorities. This could create a new market
and greater demand for that kind of mate-

rial. Encrypted content sharing means com- -

pletely private communication that can’t be
intercepted and could be used to perpetrate
any manner of crime. A service like Mega
could be a tool to aid traditional crimes or to
enable entirely new types of cybercrimes, all

while making the detection and prosecution
of criminals exponentially more difficult.
So should we abandon our right to pri-
vacy in favor of social order? Absolutely not.
The approval of the FISA Amendments Act
Sunsets Extension Act of 2012 has autho-
rized warrantless surveillance of Americans
for another ﬁve years. The National Security
Agency is investing $1.5 billion in a massive
data center to track all forms of online com-
munication. We need some level of digital
privacy to prevent George 0rwell’s “1984”
from becoming our reality.

But privacy through encryption has such
vast potential for abuse that the threat it
poses-to our society might be equal to or
greater than any beneﬁt. There are no simple
solutions in a world where technology often
evolves faster than our laws can adapt to
it, and it’s difficult to predict what Mega
will mean in the long term./What we can be
certain of is that Kim Dotcom is playing a
pivotal role in shaping the Internet’s future.
Mega lives up to its name — this is going
to be huge. I

For The Pitt News . .

It was a Thursday night in 1989 when a
young boy pushed his head against the
glass window of a car, craning his neck
to see the letters on the movie theater
sign spell out “Akira.” He had become

enthralled with the Marvel comic book’

series over the last year before the own-
er of his local comic book store sug-
gested that he see the ﬁlm version. His
father drove him two hours on a school
night to see the ﬁlm. '

At the end of the screening, two gen-
erations of Peacocks came out of the
same theater with vastly different reac-
tions: “What the hell did we just watch?”
the boy’s father stated more than asked.

“Something awesome,” the boy re-
sponded with enthusiasm. It began, for
him, a lifelong obsession.

Joe Peacock, the little boy who once
sprinted “every single day from the bus
stop to try and get home just in time to
watch a little bit of Robotech,” is now
a man in his thirties, still passionate
about the ﬁlm “Akira.” He owns almost

 17 thousand pieces of original art from
the ﬁlm. As a part of the Pittsburgh
Anime Film Series, a newly expanded
month—long event that will attract an-
ime enthusiasts from all over to Down-
town’s Cultural District and- the Oak-

land area, the “Akira” expertwill be‘

re-launching an exhibit of these items
at the Toonseum on Liberty Avenue,
where he will be both screening the ﬁlm
and lecturing about various aspects of

it, as well as the ﬁlm’s legacy. ,

Throughout the month of February,
there will be a series of film screen-
ings and lectures on Japanese animat-
ed ﬁlms, all showing in Japanese with
English subtitles. Though many of the
events wi1l_be held directly on Pitt’s
campus, the events are free and open to
the public.

Charles Exley, .a professor of Japa-
nesegliterature and’ ﬁlm at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, explains’ that
the series “was an attempt to package
something thatthe students would be

, interested in in a format that had some
isortof instructive input.” Exley further
' described the series as “a way to bring

people together to celebratethat inter-
est in a way that has teachers and stu-
dents talking together.”

While it is atypical phenomenon
in America for childrenfto race home
from school to watch their favorite af-
ter-school specials — be it episodes of
“Dragon Ball Z” or popular MTV pro-
grams — organizers of the anime ﬁlm
series hope their events will have the
same effect on the Pittsburgh commu-
nity. A

Exley explained that there is no sin-

_ gle unifying theme to the films chosen

for the series, but that he and the event
organizers “were very interested in
ideas about memory, identity and rela-
tionships.” J , ’

in anime resides exclusivelyin a sort

Racism, sexism more worrisome
  than violence in video games

Thomas Visco
Stcyj" Wrz'ter

»

In light of the tragic shooting in Newtown,
Conn., and the nearly 1,516 gun—related
deaths since, the familiar conversation of
violence in mass media, particularly video
games, has once again garnered national
attention. While this conversation usually
follows a simple, circular path — Person
A says video games cause violent behavior,

‘ Person B says video games do not cause vio-

lent behavior and then everyone, including
Congress, decides to do nothing — there
is a growing problem in video games that
must‘beaddr’essed. ‘ -

’ There are three broad themes to most
video games: The ﬁrst has highly sexualized
women dressed in little to no clothing, the
second allows players to shoot a variety of
non-white, often impoverished inhabitants
of the developing world (“Call of Duty” refers

_ to these people as terrorists) and the third

is sports games. Oftentimes, these three

categories combine successﬁilly, as well.
Simply put, video games often stumble

into highly sexist and racist content. And

_ this dangerous reality, the subtle reinforce-

ment of American White Male Exception-
alism (Fox News syndrome), poses a far
greater threat to future generations than
video—game violence ‘ever could.

‘ Video games move fast these days. They
leave you scant time to reﬂect on the trail of
corpses you leave behind in locales such as a
Brazilian favela (“Call of Duty 2”) or a Soma-
lian ghetto (“Medal of Honor: Warﬁghter”).
And when your crack team of Anglo —Am'eri—

I ‘Lara Qroft of the ‘(Tomb Raider?’ series is one
advancement in video gameS.>M.CT.Campus _.  ;

AlnAJLlAnIna np..»»nn». vr

can special operators (plus one burly black
man) carve a bloody swath through some
godforsaken den of terrorists in [insert any
third—world country], your team ﬂies away
on a helicopter blaring “God Bless America”
with nary a thought for the damage wrought
— a common motif in most modern military
shooters.

As Ben “Yahtzee” Croshaw, an Australian-
based video game critic, said about the latest
modern military shooter, “Medal of Honor:
Warﬁghterj’ in a YouTube review, “The story
keeps dumping me in one location or another
and tells me to shoot all of the brown people
speaking foreign.”

Of course, it’s impossible to fathom that
the illiterate, impoverished masses are ca-
pable of challenging the U.S. military in a
serious way. That’s why games like “Call of
Duty” keep the racial genocide to the open-
ing levels. Every good game needs a more so-
phisticated main villain, a role which Russia,
in the minds of game designers, is uniquely
suited for. Despite the fall of the Berlin Wall,
the Red Scare has not ended, at least not in
many military-based video games.

While the modern “realistic” war shooter
is a recently horrifying trend, this all says
nothing of the entire video game industry’s
failure to solve the issue of sexism. Women,
if included at all in a game, aresex objects
more often than not. As evidenced by the dis-
embodied titillation of Cortana in the “Halo”
series or the main- character breasts of Lara
Croft in the “Tomb Raider” series, women
have not advanced much in video games.

president of the Pittsburgh Japanese
Animation Club, believes otherwise.

“I think it’s deﬁnitely more wide-
spread,” he said. “People know What it
is.”

Exley agrees with Ernstoff.

“It’s different but also very familiar.
It’s very hard to ﬁnd somebody who has
no familiarity whatsoever with some el-
ement of Japanese animation ﬁlm,” Ex-
ley said. A ’ '

In a society in which ﬁlms and TV ep-
isodes are readily streamlined to com-
puters — and more episodes of inter-
est are just a click away on sites such as
Netﬂix and Hulu — modern culture is
embedded with thesejapanese cultural
products. Exley describes phenom-
enons such as Hello Kitty, Tamagotchi
and Pokémon as-products of “GNC,” or
“Gross National Cool”  31 term coined
in 2002 to describeJapan’s status as not
necessarily an economic or military su-
perpower, but a cultural superpower.

But American interest in Japanese
animation does not end with these cul-
tural icons, Exley explained.

“Some familiarity with something
like Pokémon is liable, eventually, to
turn into familiarity with other things,”
he said. Exley believes that while almost
everyone is familiar with these obvious
Japanese cultural phenomenons, with

February 5, 2018 I The Pitt News | \/w\A/v.pitthevve.com

time will come familiarity with less’ ob-
vious cultural nuances, “because it’s all
so closely connected.”

Foreboth Ernstoff and Peacock, an-
ime’s significance resides in its ability
to resonate with people across the age
spectrum at once. While ‘Fa lot of things
that are drawn or animated are instant-
ly grouped into being for kids, instantly
for kid—like people,” Peacock thinks
that this is changing.

“I think anime was a massive part of
that [change]. Anime has permeated the
culture and given youngpeople some-

. thing they can grab onto and grow into

as they get older,” he said. He believes
this evolution “has allowed art,,illustra—
tion and animation to have a legitimacy
it didn’t have before in a more mature,
more adult setting.”

And thus, the anime ﬁlm series was
created to provide an opportunity for
animpe lovers (and those who enjoy ex-

periencing new things) to -both cele- V "A

brate their interest and meet in the sort
of adult setting both Peacock and Exley

A described.

“When you’re a child, it’s crazy and

wild and funny. When you’re a teenager, I‘ 

it’s got all these great°one—liners,” Pea-
cock said. “As an adult, it reminds you
of your childhood without making you
feel like you’re a child.”

This is particularly shocking, since women
started off on relatively level footing. Samus in
the “Metroid” games, which ﬁrst appeared in
1987, is the greatest heroine in gaming history.
She remains in armor for most of the game,
hiding her gender until the end. Even today, the
reveal of Samus’ body outside of her armor is

5 . as surprising and memorable as itwas in 1987.

Lara Croft ruined all of that, though. And

 

 

now, with a reboot of the “Tomb Raider” series
being released in March, it seems Lara will get
back to work soon enough. The new develop-
ers of the reboot have been careﬁil to avoid the
normal pitfalls of Lara Croft — the comically
skinny waist, large breasts and exposed midriff
— that plagued the original games.

But “Tomb Raider” set a tone in video
games that has yet to be undone.

Video games are violent, and we should
discuss that as an issue relevant to popular
culture. But more problematic is the steady
growth of racist and sexist undertones into

 3:: at‘ '

fully—blossomed, well—written overtures. Vio-
lent video games are certainly a societal issue,
but the racist and sexist undertones in gaming
affect society more frequently because they
reinforce ignorance. '

Of course game designers are making this
sort of game for a reason: Consumers buy
them. If change will ever happen, consumers
must demand it — and they probably won’t.

I won’t advocate the dissolution of these
game series. After all, they are simply video
games. But they are a cultural manifestation
of a "circular affirmation of American culture

and foreign policy. It’s problematic that the
nameless “bad guys” you haplessly gun down
in games like “Call of Duty” are portrayed as
more villainous than the American traversing
the globe killing thousands and breaking all
sorts of national sovereignty.

The video-game industry, players and de-
signers, need self—control and self—reflection.
If developers want to place a player in a hyper-
violent fantasy world, as they often do, then
they need to come up with a better excuse than
some poor foreigner threatening Americans’
apple pie. I

WRESTLIING

Pitt dominateswest Virginia in nonconference match it

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

Pitt heavyweight Zac Thomusseit
ﬂattened his West Virginia oppo-
nent’s shoulder for a ﬁrst-period
pin to put an exclamation point on
a dominating victory for the Pan-
thers over their longtime rival. ’

Thomusseit, the No.8-ranked
wrestler nationally in his weight
class, recorded his team—high

10th pin of the ‘season, moving-
himtinto fourth in the NCAA  -
most-pins this season. He is the

nation’s leader in pins at 28.5
pounds. ,

His pin capped off a lopsided
31-9 triumph at the Fitzgerald
Field House on Saturday night
for.the Panthers (8-4, 2-1 East-
ern Wrestling League) over their
neighbors to the south and for-'

mer conference foe,.the West;

Virginia Mountaineers.

No. 2 Matt Wilps preceded;

Thomusseit with a pin, but he
waited’ until seven seconds re-
mained in the match to earn the
team six points.

“I just kept battling it out and
got a little lucky with a last-sec-
ond pin,” Wilps said.

Wilps, Pitt’s highest-ranked
wrestler, often wrestled down to
competition earlier in the season
but has been wrestling his best
matches as of late.

West.Virginia head coach
Craig Turnbull spoke highly of
the Panthers.’ lineup. Turnbull
has been the headjman for the
Mountaineers since 1979, and Pitt
head’ coach Rande Stottlemyer is
likely the only man who knows

more about the Pitt wrestling pro- .
1 gram. A Stottlemyer ‘began as the
head coach at Pitt the same year .

that Turnbull started at  9

“They have a very nice lineup
— probably as nice of a lineup as
they have had in a while,” Turn-
bull said.

‘Although the match ended
strongly for the Panthers, it didn’t
get off to such a greatstart.

At 125 pounds, Pitt went with
Godwin Nyama against West
Virginia’s Shane Young. Nyama
wrestled closewith the senior,
only trailing by a point after the
first and second periods. But
Young ultimately recorded the
8-3 decision.

BARNES BURNER

Rebounding, defense key recent success for improving Panthers

Nate Barnes
Senior Stcgﬁ’ Wrz'ter

The Pitt men’s basketball team
endured a rough start to Big East
play, starting off with a 1-3 record
in the conference after losing to

- Cincinnati, Rutgers and Marquette

in three of Pitt’s first four confer-
ence games.

Since losing to Marquette in
overtime onjan. 12, Pitt’s gone 6-1,

with the Panthers’ onlyilosscom:

ing on the road against then-No.
12 Louisville — a team previously
ranked as the top team in the na-
tion — by just three points.

The biggest difference for the
Panthers (19-5, 7-4 Big East) re-
sides in an improved focus on de-
fense, according to redshirt senior

guard Tray Woodall.

“Just locking down defensively,”
Woodall said when asked about the
difference in the Panthers’ play be-
tween the 1-3 start and the recent
6-1 stretch. “I think guys are a lot
more committed defensively.”

The defensive attitude pre-
vailed again on Monday night as
Pitt delivered a 56-46 victory over
Seton Hall. Pitt came out a little
shaky, but righted the ship in the
second half to maintain its strong

“‘streteh.between its victory Satur-

day againstthen-No. 6 Syracuse
and its matchup Saturday on the
road against No. 24,Cin'cinnati.

“It’s a good win. [It] keeps our a

momentum going,” redshirt junior
small forward Lamar Patterson
said after a 12-point, 10-rebound

performance against the Pirates.
And for anyone who’s listened
to ajamie Dixon press conference,
the difference for Pitt has always
lain within the rebounding mar-
gin and Pitt’s much-publicized 10-
man rotation. In validating Dixon’s
belief, Pitt has lost just one game
when out-rebounding its oppo-
nent, with the only loss coming

_ against Louisville — a defeat more‘
based on Pitt’s 3—for—12 free—throw

shooting that evening than its re-
bounding.

“When we haven’t rebounded,
we haven’t won in a few instances,
and we’ve only lost a few games,”
Dixon said. “That seems to be the
constant —— we understand that.

seven games. Zach Schaffer | Senior Staff Photographer

Pitt scored the game’s next four points,
but the Pirates responded with a 6-0 run to
take their ﬁrst lead at 18-16. '

Back-to-back 3-pointers by Seton Hall ju-
nior guard Fuquan Edwin kept the Pirates in
front, but Pitt battled back with a 3—pointer
by redshirt freshman Durand Johnson and
a 3-point play by freshman centertsteven

Adams to level the score at 24 heading into '

halftime. ‘
Patterson stated that even though the
A ﬁrst half didn’t go as Pitt’would’v”e liked, the
team-remained conﬁdent that it would pull
out thevictory. __ A A
' “When your shot_s,'aren’t-falling‘, it does
get frustrating,” the small forward said. “But
we fought through it and faced adversity?’
The teams traded points early in the sec-
ond half before the Panthers ﬁnally put a
run together.

- After a missed layup by Pitt, Adams
snared his 12th rebound of thellgame, got
fouled and the 33—percent free-throw shoot-
er surprisingly converted both shots from
the charity stripe. Then, following arsetoh
Hall turnover, junior ].J. Moore’ W‘, -  ' U

Then Adams played a role in another of
the contest’s deﬁning moments. -

The freshman center spun off his defend-
er and powerfully dunked the ball —l too
powerfully for the officials’ liking. Adams
was charged with a technical foul for hang-
ing on the rim, but the incident sparked
new life into a previously lackadaisical Pitt
squad and its fans.

With the modest Petersen Events Center
crowd now vociferously behind its team,
the Panthers responded by making several
defensive stops and getting enough offense
to hold off Seton Hall. V 

Redshirt sophomore guard Cam Wright
felt that Pitt used the energy from the crowd
to earn its seventh Big East win of the season.

“We had great fan support tonight with
the Oakland Zoo, and we fed off of that,”
Wright said. i

‘The feisty contest was built for Adams,
who ﬁnished with eight points and a career-
high 15 rebounds. Patterson led the Panthers
with 12 points in another balanced offensive
effort for Pitt.

Winners of six of its last seven games, Pitt
will hope to keep the goodrun going when
it travels to Cincinnati on Saturday fora 6
p.m. tipoff. The Panthers lost at home to

the Bearcats in their Big East opener back

in late December. g

period to tie the match. Then, Pitt’s
141-pounder hit a takedown, and it looked
as though he would ride out the Mountain-
eer wrestler for the upset win. '

With 30 seconds remaining in the
match, Pennesi reversed Shaffer and
earned two near fall points to ultimately
get the 5-4 decision win. A

Pitt distanced itself from WVU in the
next three matches with a decision and
two major decisions. ~

Ronnie Garbinsky defeated Tre Miller-
Scott, 11-3, at 149 pounds for his major

decision, but he didn’t dominate early. ’

FROMHPAGE 
BARNES

We kind of knew that beforehand. That was
something we were preaching and talking
about.”

In its ﬁrst four conference games, Pitt
was out-rebounded three times by its op-
position with each game ending in a loss.
Since then, Pitt has out-rebounded every
one of its opponents, save the game against
Providence, in which the Panthers tied with
the Friars at 30 rebounds apiece in Pitt’s
68-64 win. 4

“The rebounding has improved, there’s
no question about it. I think our defense has
improved too, and those go hand-in-hand
to some degree,” Dixon said. 

Backing up that statement, Pitt has also
delivered some of its best defensive perfor-
mances of the season in its last three victo-
ries, allowing 27.7 percent shooting against
DePaul, 36.7 percent versus Syracuse, and
only 33.3 percent Monday night.

But with all the improvements Pitt’s made
in the recent weeks, there still remains much
to work on for this Panthers team.

The primary concern for Dixon heading
down the stretch resides in the Panthers’
free-throw shooting. It can be argued Pitt’s
poor free-throw shooting this season cost
the Panthers games against Marquette (13-
for—26) and Louisville (3-for-12) — wins
that would have the Panthers at the top of
the conference if Pitt could have made its
free throws.

“I said to the guys [after Monday’s game],
‘hopefully you can hit the gym on your own
and shoot some free throws,’” Dixon said.
“We’ve gotta make a concerted effort [to
improve], we’ve got to rebound them well,
too. [Free—throw shooting] is obviously the
ﬁrst thing that stands out.”

But Dixon again described the defense
and rebounding as where the path will lie for
Pitt’s success as the calendares-logs,_tj}_rough

the snowstorms of February toward"‘the-

promise of spring in March.

“Defense and rebounding — we’re never .

going to be satisﬁed by that but the numbers
have been pretty good lately,” Dixon said.
“So, you know, we want to continue in that
direction.” a

Garbinsky trailed 3-2 in the second pe-
riod before exploding for two takedowns,
an escape and three near fall points. The
one point for the riding-time advantage
gave Pitt the major decision and four team
points.

The second major decision came when
Donnie Tasser blankedjason Luster, 11-0.
Tasser has also wrestled better in recent
matches and once again dominated in rid-
ing time with over five minutes.

No. 17 Tyler Wilps looked on his way to
a major decision when he jumped out to a
4-1 ﬁrst-period lead. But he couldn’t keep
the momentum going against Ross Renzi
and settled for a 7-3 decision.

WVU’s ﬁnal win of the night came when

174—pounder Bubba Scheffel picked up a 3-1
victory over Pitt’s Nick Bonaccorsi. Schef-
fel’s win brought the team score to 15-9 in
Pitt’s favor. Although it looked close, the
match was all but over, with Pitt’s three
best wrestlers remaining.

Those three didn’t disappoint.

Pitt’s No. 13 Max Thomusseit tallied
a major decision, and that was the least
impressive performance for a Panther at
the three highest weight classes.

Thomusseit’s 10-0 major decision
was never in question, as the sophomore
started with a takedown and three near
fall points.

The impressive Pitt match victory over
its rivals ended with Matt Wilps and Zac
