Protesto rs

By Teresa Candori

_The Pitt News

Following a decision to re-
examine its policy of selective
divestment in South Africa, Pitt's’
board-oftrustees abruptly cut its
meeting short Thursday as anti-
apartheid demonstrators chanted,
”Divest now.”

After hearing areport from the”
board's investment committee
that recommended the matter be .
referred to the executive commit-
tee, the board voted that the ex-
ecutive committee consider
strengthening its policy of selec-
tive divestment — the withdraw-"
al of all stock in corporations
which do not adhere to the Sul-
livan Principles.

Dennis Brutus, chairman of
Pitt's black studies department, -
who was invited to speak before
the board, urged the board to
vote for divestment,_citing the
failure of the Sullivan Principles
to effect progress toward the dis-
mantling of apartheid.

”The Sullivan Principles are no
longer relevant to the reality of.
the situation,” Brutus said.
”There is nothing to show the
American corporations have as-
sisted in any -way  to the im-
provement of the South African

situation.”

Brutus offered three points to
support his_argument that ”the sit-
uation in South Africa is clearly
getting worse." He cited that
repression —— including killings,
jailings and torture — is widley
publicized and is on the upswing.
He also pointed out that the
apartheid regime scored a victo-
ry in a recent South African elec-
tion and that South African Prime
Minister P.W. Botha has offered
the statement that apartheid is not
negotiable. ~

The board of trustees had vot-
ed at its last meeting in October
to divest of all -companies that did
not fall into the Sullivan Princi-
ples’ highest rating category. As
of March 31, Pitt had $14 million
invested in South African-related
corporations, according to Mike.
Hagan, Pitt assistant treasurer. 77 -
percent of these investments do
not fall into the Sullivan Princi-

ples’ top category and will be

sold by Dec. 31, 1987, leaving
Pitt with $3 million involved in

Campuses aim to meet needs

_By Rae Ann Collette A
Staff Writer

”There’s been no talk yet ofa
condom day at Pitt, but the issues

concerning the subject are of_

major concern to the student
community.”
~— Phil Moyer, SGB President

The -recent AIDS crisis has
definitely affected campuses
across the nationﬂincluding Pitt.
The warning is a resounding one
— sexually active students must
take precautions.

According to a recent‘ article in
USA Today, 70 percent of all
AIDS cases to date are attributed
to sexual transmission. As the
Surgeon General C. Everett Koop
reported, ’’AIDS is a life-
threatening disease and a major
public health issue. Thespread of
AIDS can and must be stopped.”

Students may wonder what
personal measures-of protection
are available. Abstinence is the
only 100 percent -effective

method of preventing AIDS by I"

sexual contact.

-. Although not 100 percent ef- .

fective, the conscientious use of

a condom duringsexual activity.

greatly reduces the chance of
_ .

contracting or spreading the
deadly virus.

According to a special report in
a recent Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
issue, ”For singles, caution and
condoms are the watchwords.”

Education T
AIDS -and sexually
related subjects is the
only step our campus
should need to take.

. -— Rick Fogle

”Larger’ universities usually
make condoms available in their
health centers,” said Dr. K.
Hames Evans, dean of student af-
fairs at the University of Pitts-
burgh at Bradford. Evans said that
there is no where on Bradford's
small campus to purchase con,-
doms andthat the nearest drug-
store is almost one and a half
miles away.

UPB is still awaiting a decision
concerning whether or not a con-
dom vending machine willbe in-

‘stalled in the campus’ health

about

of sexually active students  

center. Evans said UPB students
will probably see a condom

machine on- campus in the near-

future. ,

Will Pitt's Oakland campus
community ever see a condom
vending machine? According to
Assistant Vice President for Stu-
dent Affairs Dennis Donham,
there is a possibility.’

”We’re looking at ‘several op-
tions where students can pur-
chase condoms,” Donham said.

. ”Vending' machines are one alter-

native. ~ .
’’In a few weeks we- should

. have a decision as to whether our
"campus should or should not

have condom. vending
machines,” said Donham.

The University of Pittsburgh at
Greensburg offered a different
perspective about the vending
machine issue. ”Education about
AIDS and sexually related sub-
jects is the only step our campus
should need to take,” Director of
Student Life Rick Fogle said. ”At
this time, at this campus,-there
really is no need for a condom
vending machine.” '

WASHINGTON — As many as

”This epidemic has just start-

Mann of the World Health Or-
ganization.

As of Monday, 51,535 AIDS
cases had been reported in 113
countries, and Mann estimated
the number of people infected

with the virus could be hundreds 7

of times higher, possibly as high
as 10 million. ‘
Unlike other major health
problems, AIDS mainly strikes
sexually active adults in their

Abrams testifies he  

was to monitor North

WASHINGTON — Assistant
Secretary of State Elliott Abrams
testified today that, at the urging
of Secretary of State George
Shultz, he made a note to ”mo—
nitor Ollie” to determine whether
White House aide Oliver L.
North was soliciting military aid
for Nicaraguan rebels.

But Abrams told the joint
House-Senate hearings on the
Iran-Contra affair that he was con-
vinced at the time —— based part-
ly on North's personal assurances
— that North was not soliciting
arms for the Con-tras.

Under questioning at the con-
gressional Iran-Contra hearings,

A Abrams recalled that Shultz made

the point at a meeting_on Sept. 4,
1985, that ”we don't want to be

in the dark" about North's activi-

$28 million in aid
for needy approved

HARRISBURG — A Senate
committee on Tuesday approved
legislation designed to package
$28 million in job-training help
for welfare recipients.

The proposed program, ap-
proved by the Public Health and
Welfare Committee, would help
provide job-training, child-care
and education services.‘ .

Sen. David Brightbill, a Leba-
non County Republican who
sponsored the bill, said the state
would save $47 million each
year by reducing by 5,000 the
number of people receiving help

' from the Aid to Families with De-

pendent Children program.

The voluntary program would
target single parents between the
agesof 18 and 22 who have
spent more than two years on
welfare. .

Republicans angered
by LCB name change

HARRISBURG —— Republicans
apparently do not agree with the
Democrat-proposed name change
for the Liquor Control Board, say-
ing it would be a waste of money.

The suggested renaming of the
LCB to the Alcoholic Beverages
Commission — included in
Casey administration—backed
legislation to maintain the state li-
quor monopoly —-is among the
topics discussed by the Republi-
cans in private meetingson the
bill, senators said.

Critics of the liquor bill have

.said it does little‘ more than

change the name of the LCB and
shift enforcement of the liquor
code to the state police.

 
Clarification

of The Pitt News indicated that the
incidence of AIDS in Pittsburgh is be-
tween 4,000 and 5,000. The state-

The Zeta Beta Tau house on Bayard before it was
demolished and the new one built on University Drive.

Life on the hill

Three years after the move 

By Marc Duchin

Assistant News Editor

The symbol of tradition and
heritage for most fraternities is
their house. Yet, even when a
fraternal brotherhood lasts a life-
time, a house may not. '

Three years ago, six fraternities
said goodbye to their old, beat-
up houses on Bayard and North
Bellefield to move up to the
brand new, modern living quart-
ers on the hill overlooking Pitt
Stadium.

”We basically had no choice,”
said Rick Kozlowski, a Delta Tau
Delta brother. ”Our old house
had some problems with it. We
had been in it for 80 years. It was
getting old. .

”We could have stayed in our
old house, but it would cost a lot
of money to renovate it.”

Pitt organized the fraternity
moves by launching a Fraternity
Housing Campaign that provided
for the housing construction of

eight fraternity chapters. The

campaign's objectives were to
provide for the housing of chap-
ter members, "redirect the focus
of fraternity activities to the main-
stream of campus life and relieve
the pressures and tensions of liv-
ing in residential neigh-
borhoods.” -

The total cost of a fraternity
house was designated at

$450,000, of which the universi-
ty provided $350,000.
”Everyone’s houses were run-
down, and the university offered
all the fraternities on campus the
same deal,” said Kozlowski.
”A lot of people were against
the move because you sort of lose
the atmosphere of having an old
house,” said Kozlowski.

‘ 

We've gotten along
pretty well up here.

—— Rick Kozlo wski

According to Bridget Guernsey,
Greek advisor, the university
spent a great deal of money in
preparing the land on the hill be-
fore the houses were built.

Guernsey also said a local
citizens’ group affiliated with the
Bellefield Housing Association
lodged complaints against the
fraternities and supported the
move of the fraternities to the hill.

"The group was lobbying to get
us out for many years,” said
Kozlowski.

‘Helen Schlenke, member of
the Bellefield Housing Associa-
tion's citizens’ group, said, ”We
rea|ly-had problems. They made
all this noise.

’’I think if our group hadn't

been around, they [the universi-
ty] wouldn't have moved any of
the fraternities from this area. We
really made a case for moving
them.”

Phi Gamma Delta is one ofthe.

fraternities that decided to stay in
their original house. ”We had no
problem with our mortgage or
anything,” said Chris Davis, a Phi
Gamma Delta brother. ”We just
didn't feel the need to move up
the hill. We've gotten along with
our neighbors pretty well." .

Kozlowski said the Greek com-
munity on the hill has had no
major problems or complaints.
”We’ve gotten along pretty well
up here. it's ‘nice because you
draw a lot of people up here be-
cause a lot of houses are all
together now.

”The houses have a lot of
character now, and everyone’s
pretty happy with them,” said
Kozlowski.

Guernsey said the original Zeta

Beta Tau, Theta Chi, Sigma Chi T
and Delta Tau Delta houses have
torn down and._
replaced, by townhouses. The Phi "

been sold,

Kappa Theta house remains
deserted_and the Sigma Alpha Ep-

silon house was bought by the A
Pittsburgh Junior League and ex-

ists as a showcase house.

Guernsey said the university"

has no future plans to move any
more fraternities to the hill.

University proposes
new ticketing policy

By Beth Ernst

For The Pitt News

Due to the projected loss of
460 parking spaces, a new
_ticketing policy has been im-
plemented and will be effec-
tive this fall on all university
lots, according to Janet D.
Thomas, lieutenant for finan-
cial services in the parking
office. The new regulations
will be enforced by campus
police.

Under the new policy,
drivers who park in campus
lots without courtesy passes or
Pitt parking permits will be is-
sued citations. If two or more
fines. remain unpaid, these
drivers will find themselves

with a third ticket and their
cars immobilized by the
”Denver Boot.” For the boot
to be removed, said Thomas,
the violator must pay a daily
fee for it as well as all out-
standing fines.

The fines themselves have ‘
yet to be determined and will
vary. They will be higher for
those who park in han-
dicapped spaces without
authorized permits or license
plates, or for those who park
in fire lanes. There will,
however, be a discount for
those who pay their fines with-
in five days.

Drivers holding parking per-
mits may also be affected by
the new policy. Violators will
receive fourwarnings, after

When theology
meetscold reality

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
— Maternal aphorism

As the specter of AIDS looms ever larger on America's sen-

sual horizon, we, as the most promiscuous strata of society,

begin to sweat.

Greater access to contraceptives can only lead to increased
promiscuity. ‘ .
. - — Falwellian fallacy

To_ the eye blinded by outdated doctrine, Falwell may have
something. i _

He must not have AIDS, nor must any of his upstanding, het-
erosexual friends. He, and those with a societal death wish simi-
lar to his, have nothing but tunnel vision. '

The threat of AIDS is, and certainly should be, a question
of health, rather than a question of morality. The disease, once
installed in the body, cares nothing for the sexual preferences
or moral biases of the host. In death, we are all equal.

At this time, there is no cure for the disease, and the prospects
on that front are remarkably grim. The only weapons we have
are prevention and educational rhetoric. Neither should be for-

feited to the lesser good of allegiance to a counter-productive
' theology. ‘

1

Sex as recreation is not new, and it isn't going to“ go away.
There is no reason for its cessation. We have at our disposal
the means to prevent AIDS. .

Failure to do so is deadly; it is also ridiculous.

Whathath the SGB
wrought thus far?

With last night's announcement of a proposed university-
sponosored ”under-21 ” club, Student Government Board Presi-
dent Phil Moyer has addressed three of the four planks in his
campaign platform, though only one of these, the student ac-
tivity fee increase, has become a reality. ’

Halfway through its term of office, how has the 1987 SGB
affected campus life? Examination of concrete changes requires
sifting through such typical student government jargon as ”ex-
amining the problem,” and ”finalizing the plans.”

In terms of projects which have come to their fruition, the

I SGB has implemented a legal service for students, conducted

a lobbying campaign for student financial aid and sponsored
aleadership conference, all in addition to increasing the stu-
dent activities fee. A I

We await the implementation of a taxi service, a university-
sponsored nightclub, and a student telephone directory. The
SGB is also ”examining the issues” of teaching assistant evalu-
ations and building access for handicapped students. Moyer
has proposed a coalition of Pittsburgh schools and the Govern-
mental Relations Committee has pledged to resurrect the Alli-
ance of Pennsylvania Student Governments. o-

How many of these projects will be completed within the
remainder of the SGB’s term of office? Moyer is a great advo-
cate of letting his actions speak._ We encourage Moyer and the

SGB to note that proposals, unfinished plans and unconclud_- _'

restaurant and everyone rising
from their seats to applaud you as '

the maitre d’ guides you to your
‘usual table. ’ '
Picture yourself on a street

‘Who are you?’ You're a movie

I was about seven years old
when I went to my first real PG
motion picture. I remember walk-
ing into the theatre with my par-
ents, expecting to see a typical
cartoon. The film was Jaws.

For two hours, I was terrified,
thrilled, and spellbound by the
huge screen in front of me. When
the credits rolled and the au-
dience cheered, I was never quite
the same.

Hollywood became an obses-
sion. On the average, I’saw two

movies per week. I longed for the_
‘ .adventures of my favorite film’

heroes. -

I I used to doodle Academy
Awards on my notebooks. I
almost failed the fourth grade._

Growing older meant realizing
the prospect of instablity in an ac-
tor’s life and the rarity of fame.
Yet, a movie role always re-
mainedta dream for me.

Who would have thought that
in Pittsburgh, my ”larger than
life” dream would come true?

is being shot on location in the -

South Side of Pittsburgh. A week
later she told me one of the ex-

quit his job, and she arranged an
appointment for me with the cast-

The night before the appoint-
ment, I had difficulty sleeping. I
relapsed into my fourth grade
daydreams. Perhaps, I thought,
whenthe director sees me, he'll
recognize my true talent and cast
me/in a future leading role.

On the day of the appointment,
I was still deep -in fantasies of
fame. Around 4 p.m., my friend
and I pulled, into the parking lot
of a small, seemingly deserted

I never really liked U2 that

But this song is a refreshing
departure from the the band's

Clean, commercial, kick-ass
rock is Bryan Adams’ specialty.
Cuts Like A Knife and Reckless,
his last two LPs, were filled with
his raspily sung, high-charged
hard pop and established Adams

Adams and songwriting partner
Jim Vallance run into trouble.
While their attempts to write
about the suffering of the Indian
and the sorrow of war are noble,
too many cliches sink both ”Na—

, In fact, too—often-used phrases
pollute all the album's songs.
Adams offers observations like
only the strong survive and it’s a‘

No one’s asking Adams to be
profound, but at the very'Ieast he

THE PITT NEWS

Wednesday, June 3, 1987

By Celeste Phillips

For The Pitt News

Cajun country will be the
setting for four University of
Pittsburgh men's track and
field athletes who head for Ba-
ton Rouge, La., for the 1987
NCAA Outdoor Track and
Field Championships.

The meet, which will be
held on the campus of Louis-
iana State University, will
bring together the top collegi-
ate track and field athletes
from all ‘around the United
States.

Topping the list of Pitt's
competitors is All-World sen-
sation Lee McRae.

McRae’s success in the in-
door season has continued
now into the outdoor season.
He was the 1987 Big East 100‘
and 200‘meter champion. In
winning the 200‘meters, the
junior from Pembroke, N.C.,

set a new meet record of

... With wings
on their heels

Four Pitt men runners
prepare for the NCAAs

20.70.

McRae continued to shatter
records at the lC4As, where
his first-place 10.20 finish in
the 100‘meters also set a meet
record. It isn't too much to say
that spectators at this year's
NCAA Championships can
again expect to see another
dazzling performance from
McRae. , ‘

Also expected to shine at
this year's NCAA meet is
senior A|l—America middle dis-
tance runner Tim Manes.

The Greenville, Pa., resident .
has enjoyed a successful out-
door campaign, placing se-
cond in the 800—meters at the
Big East Championships and

‘fifth at the lC4A Champi-

onships.

Another. middle distance
runner who will be expected
to do well this year is sopho-
more A|l—America Dave

-Moore.

See if you can remember this.

About two years ago, a young,
naive, yet brutally strong fresh-
man named Craig Heyward went
out for a walk one night with a
set of crutches and decided to use
these tools —— usually associated
with assistance — to club stu-
dents over the head.

Remember that?

That was a nasty thing to do,
wasn't it? But Craig got a nasty
rap across the knuckles and a
good hollerin’ and has since seen
the error of his ways and
behaved. '

Now see if you can remember
this. ‘

About the same time Craig was I

performing the Oakland Crutch
Massacre, a group of about five
members of the football team
decided to go to a local non-

Merchant chosen by Pirates infirst round?

‘ By Micheal Hirsh-

Associated Press Writer

. Mark Merchant, an 18-year-old
switch-hitting outfielder
described as bothfast and power-
ful, was selected by the Pittsburgh
Pirates Tuesday in the first round
of baseball's June free—agent draft
and signed shortly afterward.

Merchant was the second play-

er picked in the draft after Ken
Griffey Jr; went to the Seattle
Mariners.

‘ ”He’s got a lot of drive and

hustle... He's a Pittsburgh type of 2

player,” said Director of Scouting

, . Elmer Gray. ”He’s one of ‘those,
. . Players wk? sivesr110 Perselnt-"*

    

players, et al, need babysitters g

prohibitionary establishment and

get themselves-soused up real

good. This resulted into a nice lit-
tle bar-room brawl where more
than a few people were hurt.

.Ooooh, that was a really nasty
thing to do. ‘ .

Or how about the time when
Tony Williams punched his girl-
friend in Lothrop Hall's lobby? Or
when Dexter Harrison and Dante
Wiley decided to feel their oats
by terrorizing some freshmen at
the beginning of the school year?

And how can you ever forget
when Bill Fralic, the great Bi/I
Fralic, thought he was throwing
a nice bomb pass to his girlfriend
in Hemingway's? Instead of a

‘football, it turned out to be a glass

that hit her squarein the face. I

guess it was lucky for him that ’

she decided to settle out of court,

Merchant, a 6-1, 180-pound
product of Oviedo High School

in Oviedo, Fla., was recently

named the 1987 Florida State

Player of the Year. He hit .419 in '

28 games for Oviedo this season
with seven doubles, two triples,
five home runs and 23 runs bat-
ted in. '

Merchant also proved his
prowess on the base paths,‘ steal-
ing 48 bases in 49 attempts and
scoring 49 runs to lead the team
to a 22-6 record.

”Mark has the necessary talent
to become a complete player,”

said Pirates General Manager Syd

Thrift. ”He’s shown rare power

from both sides~of the plate‘

huh? .
Well, it seems we have a new

addition to this nasty little list.

ago.”

Another factor in choosing
Merchant was his willingness to
sign right away, Thrift said.

’’I was convinced beyond any
doubt that this young man was
sold out to play’ baseball,” he
said. '

Merchant was signed by Pi-
rates’ scout Fred Goodman just
hours after he was picked, the
team announced. No terms were
disclosed, but in a telephone con-
versation before the signing, Mer-
chant said he expected a ”fair”

play, desire to excel and a great

tackle Tony Siragusa, all six feet
five inches and 255. pounds of
both-of them, decided it was their
turn to have a day in the sun. Sub-
sequently, they now have
charges of assault against them
from two patrons of -the Sanctu-
ary. Aren't they tough? .
The shame of thiswhole thing
is that both Grossman and Siragu-

sa are two of the better members-

of the Panther squad. Maybe the
problem is that they know it, and,
because of the seeming lack of
discipline from the bygone Foge
era, they think they can get away
with anything. A

It doesn't matter who athletes
decide to fight — what matters is
that they fight just for the hell of
it. As athletes at Pitt, usually on
full scholarships, they have a job
to do and an image to maintain.

by their experience with Jeff King,
the first pick in last year's draft.
King didn't play his first game for
the Pirates’ Class A Prince Wil-
liam club until July 25 because of
protracted contract talks, in effect,
losing his first season.

Thrift said the decision to select
Merchant was unanimous after
Griffey went first. The two play-
ers were ”one-two on our list,”
with Griffey proving the slightly
faster runner but Merchant show-
ing a better arm, he said.

Thrift said Merchant might
make it to the major leagues in
four years because of his ”out-
standing intangibles: desire to

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, June *3, I937

Baseball

By Tarun Reddy
Staff Writer

Now that the baseball season
is into its third month, it's time to
‘take a look at some of the sea-
son's highlights.

Most people predicted great

' things for the Phillies — the N.L.

East title, among other things.

So, where are the Phillies now?
They're improving, but that's the
only thing a team can do after
spending so many weeks in the
division cellar.

Speaking of the Phillies, two of
their preseason decisions proved
not to be very lucrative for them

during season play.

First, they traded starting pitch-
er Charles Hudson to the Yankees
in exchange for outfielder Mike
Easler.

While Hudson has already
won six games for the Yankees,
Easler has missed halfthe season
with an injury.

At themoment, it would ap-
pear the Yankees committed
larceny in this deal.

The second deal the Phillies
completed sent outfielder Gary
Redus to the White Sox in ex-
change for pitcher Joe Cowley.
On the surface, it appears the
Phillies made a good trade.

Redus is hitting an anemic .214
with the White Sox. However, he
has stolen 16 bases.

The Phillies, on the other hand
received Cowley, a pitcher who
has experienced severe difficulty
in trying to pitch his way into the
fifth inning.

Certainly the Phillies could
have asked for a better pitcher,
but obviously they didn't.

If Tom Browning comes any-
where close to his rookie season
in which he won 20 games, the
Reds will capture the N.L. West
title. Unfortunately Browning is
currently 4 and 6 with a 7.86
ERA. ‘

Tony Gwynn, one of the
game's best al|—around players, is
stuck in San Diego suffering with
the rest of his teammates.

Of course, it's an even greater
shame that the young outfielder
recently had to file for
bankruptcy.

The Padres have had losing
streaks of five or more games on
five different occasions so far this
yeaL

Speaking of the Padres, their
present owner, Joan Kroc, has
rescinded an offer to sell the club

to Seattle Mariners owner George
Argyros.

At the same time, Argyros said
he didn't want to purchase the
Padres. Apparently, Argyros
couldn't stomach the thought of
being associated with another
pathetic franchise.

Argyros nickled and dimed his
team to mediocrity. The Mariners
average salary ranks last in the
majors. A player on the Mariners
could be expected to earn‘ half
the per capita salary in baseball.

It has also been reported that
had Argyros and Kroc been able
to agree on a selling price, the
rest of the owners in the Nation-
al League would have unani-
mously rejected his acceptance
into the National League.

So far, the Cubs’ Rick Sutcliffe
and the Royals’ Bret Saberhagen,
men who won the 1985 Cy
Young Award in their respective
leagues, appear to be safe bets to
be named their respective
league's Comeback Player of the
Year.

The Cleveland Indians, holding
up the tradition of being jinxed
due to their appearance on the

-highlights for the third n5[on[I§_

cover of Sports Illustrated, are the
victims of a terrible pitching staff.
The team ERA is above five runs
a game. But what is more surpris-
ing is the inability of their ”slug-
gers” to produce any runs. Joe
Carter, Mell Hall and Corey
Snyder are all hitting below .250,
with Snyder hitting the lowest at
.214.

Is it my imagination, or has Ge-
orge Steinbrenner, the Yankees’
usually caustic owner, been quiet
about his team's performance?
This just might be the year the
Yankees put their pitching and
hitting together to win the A.L.
East

The team currently chasing the
Yanks, the Toronto Blue Jays,
have one of the top hitting duos
in the majors. Outfield compatri-
ots George Bell and Jesse Barfield
have combined for 28 homers
and 66 runs batted in. Over a full
season, that computes to 98
round—trippers and 231 runs bat-
ted in.

I'm only stopping here so I can
begin to write the acceptance
speeches for Messrs, Sutcliffe and
Saberhagen.

Moore, who hails from
Philadelphia's Overbrook

The only Pitt hurdler to
qualify for the national meet is-

The sophomore from Wil-

indoor 110-meter hurdle
