SG To Sponsor
A Book Exchange
Service Again

By TRUDY WEISS

The Student Government Book
Exchange will again be oﬁered as
a serviceto students in the winter
trimester.’

Successful results of the exper-
imental exchange held last Sep-
tember prove the necessity of this
function on .campus, according to
Jay Fingeret, chairman of the
Book Exchange Committee.

Fingeret announced that the ex-
change will run_ from Jan. 4 until
Jan. 13. in 302 and 306 in the Stu-
dent Union.

The ﬁrst attempt at a student
book exchange was operated on
a small scale to see how well it
would be accepted. ~ “Students
supported the plan with enthu-
siasm,” Fingeret said. “Ap-
proximately 250 books passed
through the exchange in four
days.” The exchange was held

Law Graduates
Rank Secontl In,

A Bar Examination

Students graduating from the
University's Lat: School ranked
second in the country on the Bar
Examination which was given last
recently an-
nounced. "

The passing percentage of Uni-
versity students was 82.14,’ and
was surpassed only by Harvard's
86.66 per cent. The Harvard prec-
ord of passing percentage is the
highest ever reached. .

Thomas M. Cooley II, dean of
the Law School, stated that the
University, the alumni. and the ‘
downtown bar were very
pleased with the results, but
stressed that this test was no
measure for the quality of a law
school. He said. “A law school
can be judged only by the char-
acter and quality of the law-
, yers it produces.” " ‘S
Out of the 28 University stu-

dents taking the’ Bar Examination
for the first time, 23 passed" it. In ’

addition to the Harvard score,
other schools participatingvshowed
these results: University of Penn-'
sylvania passed‘ 67.14 Del’ cent.
Yale. 70 per cent Temple 62.16
per cent. ,  A ‘
Dean Cooleyxsaid the improve-

‘--~-Omoney back to the depositor.

These attempts at defrauding
the telephone company have been
going on for the past three weeks
and several times the telephone
company has ﬁxed the phones
only to have them broken again.
This along with an unusual
amount of long distance calls from
Schenley Hall telephones, caused
the investigation.

Jerry Vvhalen, head resident
counsellor in Schenley Hall, re-
ported that the attempt to de-
fraud the telephone company is
subject to a $200 fine and or
six months in the county work-
hotise. This is also a violation
of the sales tax and on out-ob
A state calls is a federal offense.
However, Whalen said that the
FBI will not be called into the
case if investigators of the tele-
phone company are able to solve
the case satisfactorily. ,

Students are presently being
questioned and the telephone
company will not press charges if
students being questioned confess
to the calls they made, Whalen
said. However, the telephone
company is checking‘ many of the
long distance calls, and if the stu-
dents being questioned deny mak-
ing calls and are guilty, then the
company will press charges.

“This should not be neces-
sary,” Whalen said, “because
students have cooperated and
volunteered aid and confessions
of calls. It's unfortunate that a
thing like this happens, but this
goes on in every University at
one time or another.”

The shame of the entire thing is
that many students believe it's
perfectly okay to make calls on a
broken phone as long as they

themselves did not fix the phone.”

Sports Trophy

By BOB SCHWIIIDIER

A motion to abolish the all-

sports trophy was discussed at —the

‘ last" meeting of the Interfraternity

 Its failure to stimulate
competition in fraternity sports

Twasrcited as the chief reason for

its abrogation.

It was also pointed out that the” 
 trophy has stiﬂed enthusiasm over

sports played at the end of the
season, because only teams which
have _a reasonable chance of"w'm-

hing it participated to their fullest. ”

-This motion was tabled until
the next meeting so that the con-
census of the fraternities could be
determined. 1

A motion was passed to es-

’ tablish a pledge trainer com-

mittee, which would have reg-

ulatory powers over the pledge

.poliices of our fraternity sys-
tem.

Trophi ; were given to the first

and second place winners in foot-

ball, ping pong, and squash. First

lplace in football went to Sigma

Chi in the A league, and Sigma
Phi Epsilon in the B league.
Delta Tau Delta came in ﬁrst in

ping pong, and Pi Lambda Phi

placed ﬁrst in squash.

Bill Herron reported on the Na-
tional Interfraternity Convention

K - which he attended in Los Angeles.

Among the things discussed at the
convention were methods of im-
proving the scholastic rating of
fraternities.

Jim Burton, chairman of the
athletic committee. asked that
the fraternities encourage their
membership to support inter-
collegiate sports at the Univer-
sity during the winter trimester.

A dance similar to the Pan Hel-

A lenic Ball will be discussed in de-

tail at a later meeting.

Library Participates
In Trainee Program;

By CHRIS Ll’NDBERG _

Eight graduate students, employed in the University,
library, are enrolled in the Trainee Program‘i‘or future
librarians. In this program graduates work for their Master,
of Library Science at Carnegie Tech and work part time or
full time in the University library. This employment not
only offers valuable supplementary

tinaiieially over this two year per-
iod.

In the United States alone last
year there were 10,000 job open-
ings and only 800 applicants.
These jobs ranged in salary from
$4,600 to $12,000.

One of the most interesting as-
pects of the Trainee Program is
the fact that there are no speciﬁc:
course i'eqiiii‘enients or majors for
undergraduate preparation. While
English and Language majors are
recoimnended. students graduatiiig
in history, political seieiiee. econo-
mies and music are just as accept-

A Thrilling Win
Brings in Hoop
Season for Cats

By TED COLTON
Sports Editor

Trailing by 16 points with less than 16 minutes to go in the game

 ' the surpising Panthers came back like a bat out of heaven to upset

a heavily favorite Purdue team, 81-80, Friday night.

John Fridley drove in from the left side to score the winning
basket with eight seconds left in the game. The Blue and Gold trail-
ed the Boilermakers from the Cf—.ll‘l_V minutes of the ball game to those
last eight seconds. sometimes by as many as 22 points.

It was one of the most. thrilling Panther basketball games ever
played at the Field House. _

At the end of the game the students rushed out onto the court
and congratulated the tired Panthers for their come-from-behind

victory. It looked like the Cats had just won the NIT.

It was a big win for Coach Bobby Timmons and his basket-
ballers. The pre-season prospects have been anything but bright
for this year’s Pitt hoopers. Timmonshas pointed out a lack of
height as the Panthers main concern and this was apparent in
the first game. Rarely did Pitt get that second shot at the basket.

Second hall‘ sharp—shooting and ﬁne aggressive defensive play
were the elements that led to the upset. A full—court press that had
the Boilermakers throwing the ball away enebled Pitt to cut down
that 22 point lead to six, four. two. back to four, then two, tie it up,
[all behind by one, then ﬁnally win by one.

Outstanding players for the Panthers were Dick Falenski. who
ttcored 14 points in the last 16 minutes, and Fridley. who scored 11
points in the second half. Two second stringers, Tom Maloney and
Howard Lockhart, were outstanding on defense. Both came up with
timely steals’ and contributed 17 points between them.

Don Steinhart was the surprise of the evening as he grabbed
17 rebounds and scored the same number of points. Steinhart is
supposed to be a good rebounder but not too good at putting the
ball in the basket. Friday night he did all right.

Saturdays six-point loss to Navy can be blamed on just one thing
--poor scheduling. After a tremendous team effort Friday night the
Panthers had to go to the airport and leave for Annapolis, getting to
bed in the wee hours of the morning.

Then to top it off they had to play an afternoon game. Whoever
made up this kind of schedule must not have been thinking too much
or else he isn’t interested in Pit.t’s basketball fortunes.

The Panthers were trailing Navy by 16 and they tried to come
back again but they fell six points shy, probably because they were
just plain exhausted.

* * * * *

The student attendance at the game was surprisingzly good. Prob-
ably more than 800 of the student body braved the cold elements to
take in the thrilling contest. Illfoet not one of them regretted it.

There were four cheerleaders at the game but they didn’t
have much to cheer about until the last 16 sixteen minutes. Then
they really went wild.

Now all we need is to get that hand up there and the Field
House really will be jumping for those hoop games. (The band could
not attend last Friday’s contest because they had their annual band
concert at Carnegie Hall.) 1

Tired Cats Drop
Close One to Navy
After Upset Win

Coach B o b b y ‘l‘immon’s
Panthers will try to get above
the .500 mark tomorrow night
when they take on the Univ.
of Michigan. In their last two
meetings the Cats and Michi-

tgan split. The Panther—Michigan

all time series stands at 5-9 in
favor of Michigan.

Apparently tired by the Purdue
game Friday night when they
pulled a stunning 81-80 upset vic-
tory, the Panthers met a well
trained and physically fit Navy
team Saturday and dropped a 69-
63 decision. giving the Blue and
Gold a 1-1 mark in the young
season

The Panthers were unable to
find the scoring touch that carried
them to a win over Purdue. At
one point they trailed Navy by as
much as 15 points. However, the
Panthers went into a full court
press attempting to reduce the
Midshipmen lead.

Press Vvorked Friday

The same press helped the Pan-
thers upset Purdue the night be-
fore. With 16 minutes left, and
trailing 22 points, the press help-
ed the Panthers to come from be-
hind.

Although the Panthers were
able to cut the Midshipmen lead
through the press, it wasn’t
enough to give the Cats their
second win.

Physically the Panthers were
hurting on the boards. In presea-
son scrimmage Coach Bob Tim-
mons explained that the Achilles
heel of the team was in board
strength.

No Board Strength

“We don‘t have the strength on
the boards,” Timmons said. “Al-
though John Fridley, Don Stein-
hart and Paul Lazor are tall en-
ough, they don't have the weight
to handle the big men in battles
under the boards. It certainly
didn’t help us to play two games
in a row. When you have had a
rough game the night before you
are bound to feel it the next day."

points against Purdue, was un-

the Hula Bowl in Hawaii.

This has been a great experi-
ence for me Ditka said. I’m proud
to have been selected for All-
American recognition considering
all the great football players
across the nation.

“I think the greatest thrill I’m
looking forward to now is play-
ing in the Hula Bowl. Since I
have never been to Hawaii this
should be an unforgettable trip.”

The 1960 Look Magazine team
which comes out oﬂicially tomor-
row, says that Ditka was selected
to the team with a minimum of
debate. “Heading the list of ends
is Pittsburgh's Mike Ditka, who
has been a wrecker since his first
varsity game.

“Since nobody plays a tougher
schedule than Pittsburgh, it was
inevitable that the Panthers
have ﬂat days, as they did

Rich in history and rich in promise, too - that's York
County, Pennsylvania. .

And the telephone company covering this prosperous
and progressive community has recently become a

 
     

member of the General Telephone __fami|y.

York's pattern of growth is typical of the areas Gen Tel
serves in 31 states. Long famous for its fertile ﬁelds
and well-kept farms, the county has enjoyed a remark-
able industrial expansion since World War ll.

Typical, too. of these growing areas is their growing
need for more telephones. And that is where Gen Tel
comes in with the experience to provide improved ser-
vice and the willingness to invest in modem communi-
cations equipment.

This is just one of the ways we are working to supply
more and better telephone service

Book Exchange
Service Again

(Continued from Page I}
the ﬁrst week of the tall tri-
mester.

The small room in which the
last book exchange was held lim-
ited the number of books handled.
Because of its experimental stage
the committee did not know what
amount of traffic it could accom-
modate. and so the only books
handled were those used in the
School of Liberal Arts.

“With larger operating space we,
are now prepared to handle books‘
for all departments in the Uni-
versity,” Fingerat said. "Our big-g
gest problem in September was:
the lack 01 price lists of new books ‘
from the Book Center," he said.

A Tri-College Ski Club has
been formed by students of Du-
quesne, Pit and Carnegie Tech in
order to reduce student expenses
and promote inter-collegiate com-
petition.

Richard Accetta, from Du-
quesne, is chairman of the group.
The group will be taking week-
end trips by chartered bus to re-
served lodges throughout the
