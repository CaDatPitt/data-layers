Murderer oi Pitt minister still free; community prays

David Baynes (blue sweater) leads a prayer for Sam Brunsvold with well wisliers.

Staff Wrlter

One year after beloved campus minister
Sam Brunsvold was shot to death outside his
Highland Park home, vital questions remain
unanswered both for those who knew him
and for the police who are investigating the
murder.

And the 36-year-old ministers murder
remains unsolved

In a written statement, Brunsvold's wife
Sherri begged anyone with information
about the killing to come forward _

"Nothing will bring Sam back, but there
can still be closure to this senseless crime.
Someone is listening that knows what hap-
pened that night and needs to come forward
with that information," Mrs. Brunsvold
wrote. _

Police have no motive or suspects in the
case. The killer made no attempt to steal
Brunsvold's wallet, watch or car. I

"There is a likelihood this case can still
be solved even after a year," said Lt. Philip
Dacey from the city homicide department

He could not elaborate on any more details
of the case.

Pastor Randall Harrison, a friend and
colleague of Brunsvold's, said no one should
feel safe until the murderer is brought to jus-
trce. . ‘

"For the sake of our city, for the sake of
our safety, we call on all people of faith to
join us in praying that the murderer of Sam
Brunsvold be exposed," Hansion said in a
press conference yesterday at New Hope
Christian Community Church in Oakland.

. Brunsvold was active in the church for
nearly 10‘ years and spent much of his time
ministering to students and young people in
the Christian Student Fellowship at, Pitt and

He was returning from a leadership
meeting at the church the night he was
killed. Earlier that evening, he had hosted a
Bible discussion group for students in the
William Pitt Union.

He was shot in the head while stepping
out of his carataround 10:30 p.m on January

Would you be surprised to learn that
uranium-235, the radioactive element in
nuclear weapons, is an ingredient in smoke-
less tobacco?

Angela Provenzano, a recent Pitt grad-
uate, was surpiised, and-said she found the
“harms of smokeless tobacco” display
olfered by the Pitt dental school tobe one of
the most illuminating at‘Health Fair ‘98.

“The display should be a good_deter-
rent ‘A lot of college students do [chew
tobacco] ,” said Provenzano.

On the display placard was a descrip-
tion of what some smokeless tobacco com-
panies routinely mix with their product
Those chemicals included polonium-210
(nuclear waste), hydrazine (toxic chemical),
formaldehyde (embalming ﬂuid), cadmium
(used in car batteries), nicotine (addictive
drug) and benzopyrene (carcinogen). -

'I‘hird-year dental school students Mark
Fiss and Bryan King have also heard of
ﬁberglass being added to Copenhagen
Snuif. . _

' ‘The ﬁberglass puts tiny cuts in the lip
of the user, which enables the additives to
get into the system faster,” _said Fiss.

A black child hears some white kids call
him "nigger.'.' He has ignored it before, but

._ today he can’t take it any more. And they

ﬁght. _

Now, the black boy and his family must
leave their South Carolina farm town or risk
torture by authorities.

It sounds like a scene from a race—rela-
tions novel set in the 1950s. It's actually a
scenario in which Assistant CAS Dean
Barbara Mellix participated as a black
teenager growing up in the ‘50s. Along with

neighbors in their segregated community, ’

she helped the boy and his family move their
belongings and their lives out of town in the

"I couldn't even imagine when I was a "

little‘ girl being where I am now," she said.
Mellix has come a long way from the
discrimination and segregation she knew as
a child. She migrated to Pittsburgh in the
early 1960s to work, ﬁnding jobs ranging

.from collecting trays in a hospital to a tele-

phone operator. Here, she met her husband
Roy, a carpenter. . '

Almost 20 years later, Mellix, now a
mother of two, returned to school part time
in 1979 to earn her English writing degree at
Pitt. She completed her studies with a
Master of Fine Arts in 1986 and accepted an
assistant professorship at Pitt Greensburg. In
1988, Mellix moved to Pitt's main campus to
the assistant dean position.

As a CAS assistant dean, Mellix talks
with students on a daily basis, helping them
with their academic and personal problems.
Her love of students as people is what drives
her.

"One of the most important things I'll
take away from here is the ability to look at

3‘ the whole person, and that's not easy to do
when you're [an adrninistrator]," she says.

"Once we get through with our business, I
get to know the student personally."

 
 

   child
 a soft advice-giver  

Punctuating her words with hand ges-
tures, Mellix repeatedly stresses how much

I » she learns each day by interacting with stu-

dents. In the past few weeks, for example,
Mellix discovered a rise in student volun-
teerism and outreach, something she will
focus on in her next issue of the CAS rnaga—
zine Ventures, of which she’s an editor.

, ‘Tm getting a sense of what the world is
going to be like when you people take over,"
she says, smiling.

Me1lix’s priority lies in getting st11dents_ .

to leave her ofﬁce feeling positive, as though
she has helped them move toward their
goals.

Marie Bartholomew, a sophomore
nursing student, fell under Mel]ix’s spell,
calling her polite, sincere and courteous. ’

 

" S he

' tance as she Bartholomew
- recalls feeling said. "She was-
‘ angry as a child n't the kind of ’
because her person who
father had to step - was just talking
out of the way of to me because
white children she had to."
c on the sidewalk
She lived in a Bartholomew
world where, as spoke , to
adults, black Mellix when a

"She wanted to see me explore as many
options as I could and go out there and try to
see if I could remain in the School of
Nursing," Bartholomew said. "She couldn't
see why I shouldn't get a second chance."

Associate Dean‘ of CAS David

Brumble called Mellix a "pillar" whose '

strength lies in understanding student needs
and concerns.

"I can rely on her for very good advice, A

and I know that students who go to her for
counseling or an academic issue will be
treated fairly," Brumble said warmly.

Mellix humbly admits knowing not
every student leaves her oﬂice happy. But
she does try tomake students understand her
reasons for denying certain requests and
advises students about alternative options.

Showing heart in a university world of
bureaucratic red tape, Mellix sincerely
expresses wanting to help students see
where problems and their solutionsglie. ’

. Bartholomew,_ who carries Mellix's card
in her wallet, said, "I would go talk to her
about any situation I was in, whether it be a
Career decision or a class decision. She has
got to be the most‘ helpful ‘person I have
talked to at this university."

President touches on several   subjects

Across the Nation

CAPITOL HILL
Appearing upbeat in the face
of personal controversy,
President Clinton delivered
the State of the Union address.
With the prospect of the
first balanced budget in 30
years, the president called on
Congress to "save Social
Security first" before doing
anything else with the antici-
pated federal budget surplus.
Clinton sounded a family-
friendly theme through much
of the speech. He proposed a
$21.7 billion initiative for
child care, called for hiring
100,000 teachers to reduce

. elementary school class sizes,

proposed extending the
Family and Medical Leave
Act, and said Americans as
young as 55 should be able to
buy into the medicare system.

On the issue of health
care, Clinton called for
increased consumer protec-
tion, including the right to
appeal when services are
denied. ‘

The president also reiter— -

ated his call for finance
reform and reform of the IRS.

PORTLAND, Ore.
Monica Lewinsky's attorney
confirms the former White
House intern had an affair
with a high school drama
teacher.

But William Ginsberg
calls that irrelevant to his
client's current legal prob-
lems.

Andy Bleiler says his
affair with Lewinsky began
after she transferred from
California's Beverly Hills
High School, where he
worked in the drama depart-
ment. Hesays it continued
during the two years she
attended Lewis and Clark
College in Oregon and went
on even "after she graduated in
1995 and left for Washington.

Bleiler says the relation-
ship ended last April after his
wife found out about it.

His attorney says
Lewinsky told the Bleilers
after she'd left for

Washington that she was hav-
ing oral sex with a "high—
ranking White House official"
and was "frustrated and agi-
tated" that the relationship
did not go further.

The attorney says

“At a time when
children suffer from

perhaps the gravest social  
problems of any group in
the U.$., how do weensure
that they grow up in the best
environment possible?”

Around The World

BAGHDAD, Iraq — The
way Baghdad sees it, an
attack on Iraq would mark the
end of President Clinton's
political life.

An Iraqi newspaper also
says the United States is
attempting to "escape their
troubles by blaming them on
others." The paper is owned
by a son of Saddam Hussein.

It's the same paper that
had earlier suggested the U.S.
might attack Iraq to shift
attention from the sex scan-
dals involving President
Clinton.

Clinton issued a veiled’
threat of force in his State of
the Union address saying Iraq
"will not defythe will of the
world."

, Iraq is suspected of hiding
weapons of mass destruction.

Clinton I is sending
Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright abroad to rally sup-
port for possible action
against Iraq.

MINISTER

28, 1997.

Sheni Brunsvold heard the gunshot

i while putting their three young children to
' bed. She went outside to see what happened

and found her husband dying in the street.

S He never regained consciousness.

As the press conference yesterday con-
cluded, Harrison invited the media to join

' him and friends of Brunsvold for a session of

fasting and praying.
"Ithink it is our prayers that's gonna

bring someone forward. I don't know even if V

it is the media. The media has covered .this
well for a year now,’ and nothing has hap-
pened, and frankly what I am asking the city
to do, all people of faith is to pray and ask
God to break this case for us," said Hanison.

Some of the students of Christian
Student Fellowship joined ‘the prayer ser-
vice which emphasized praying for forgive-
ness, for salvation, for justice, and for com-
fort and healing.

While considering a passage about for-
giveness in the Bible, students even olfered
some prayers for Brunsvold's killer.

"As hard as it may sometimes be, God
calls us to forgive and even love our ene-
mies," said Hanison.

But those prayers for forgiveness
included a need for the killer to face justice.

"Cunently, this person is still enjoying
the pleasures of freedom in our society,
while Sherri must endure the remainder of

_ her lifetime without Sam. This is not fair.

This is not just. Pray for God to allow justice

The Christian Student Fellowship con-
tinues under the leadership of David Baynes
who is taking students through the theme of
“Aiming for the Best” this spring semester.

But even under new leadership, slain
ministers legacy is not forgotten in the lives
of the students he touched.

Since the murder, student Nate Roberts
says Brunsvold's inﬂuence has caused him
to get more involved in spreading the Word
of God to others.

"I have grown a lot  I went
to Sam for help, and he led me to reading dif-
ferent books of the Bible, and we went
through a discipleship program My hope is
to help everybody saa what God has in store
for them and that God is what they need,”
said Roberts. ' . ’

Eric Randall, the chairman of the New
Hope Congregation shared what Sam's
death brought .

"Sam's death brought New Hope

Church and CSF to be much more close-knit '

as a community. We really spent a lot of time
supporting each other. The fact that we
believe that Sam is in heaven and we will get
to be reunited with him some day really
brought a great deal of comfort," said
Randall.

could have been trying to make Clinton
look bad, but they probably didn't sit down
and devise a plan to carry it out, he said.

But McKrell said he agrees with Mrs.
Clinton's counter-attack toward the
Republicans.

In an interview a day before he left for
Washington to attend the State of the Union
address, McKrell said he disregards the
questions about whether Clinton had sex
with the 21-year-old intern because he
thinks conservative leaders conspired to
humiliate the president.

"This is nothing ‘
new," he said. "Just the
same continued attacks
by Republican organiza-
tions trying to shame the
president any way they
can." _

Mike Long, presi-
dent of the Campus
Republicans, referred to
Mrs. Clinton's claim
against the Republican
Party as predictable.

"It seems to be an

of the Clinton team to
dance around the topic
and attacking instead of defending them-
selves."

Wmdt said he doesn't believe the pres-
ident will lose any political power unless
the allegations become formal charges.

"A lot of people are embarrassed about
what political ofﬁcials do behind closed
doors," he said.

Long, however, said he thinks Clinton

‘ will be politically weakened regardless of

whether charges are ﬁled.
He said other countries see the United

States as a decadent nation, and when the

president engages in immoral acts — and

FROM PAGE 1

allegedly engages in illegal acts — it per-
petuates the negative View of the U.S.

. Long also said he-thinks Clinton will
resign before he, can be impeached if
charges are ﬁled and that the truth will
come out on May 27 when the Paula Jones
case starts.

. "I think the Paula Jones trial will
destroy the president," Long said.

Wmdt said proving the president guilty

of "high crimes and misdemeanors," as out-

lined in the Constitution, is what it takes to

. start impeachment proceedings. Some have

accused Clinton of hav-
ing former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky
perjure herself in her
deposition during the
Paula Jones investiga-
tion, which would be
grounds for impeach
ment if true. ‘
If Clinton is impeached,
he would go 7 to trial
before the Senate and the
chief justice of the
Supreme Court. If a two-
thirds majority found him
guilty, Clinton would be
removed from oﬂice. 0
"Right now everybody just has to be
respectful of the president and very 
because we don't know exactly what went
on, only allegations," said Wmdt. 
, McKrell said ‘.‘[the allegations] are a
wake-up call for Democrats across America _
to realize the agenda of'Repub1icans is to
throw dirt and obscure issues.” 
Long called Clinton a "fantastic politi-
cian," and added that "it's in a negative con-

Hippocratic Oath just Cl myth today

Jennifer Stoltz_

Hillary Clinton '5
Conspiracy Theory

Hillary Clinton says this whole Monica Lewinsky
scandal is the brainchild of a huge right-wing con-
spiracy to demolish her husband’s presidency.

That’s crazy. That’s ridiculous. That’s absurd.

But it just might be true.

Only one year has passed so far in Clinton’s sec-
ond term. If he should be impeached within the next
year, in the case he obstructed justice, and if Vice
President Al Gore should be found guilty of illegal
campaign ﬁnance practices for which he is currently
under investigation, that leaves the speaker of the
House next in line for the oval ofﬁce.

And we all know who the speaker of the House is,
don’t we?

That’s right: the Pillsbury Doughboy.

Uhh, we mean Newt Gingrich.

Right-wing nutboy himself. _

If the president and vice president get knocked out
of office, Gingrich would then run the country, thanks
to the help of his Republican-majority Congress.

And though House and Senate elections will come
up this fall, a good scandal with Bill Clinton might
scare enough people away from voting Democratic to

_ keep the Republican incumbents in ofﬁce.

A right’-wing extremist conspiracy theory just
might be true. .
But notice the word “extremist.”

There probably are a few nut cases out there who‘

will do anything to usurp power, even if it means cre-
ating a scandal that could tear our nation apart.

On the other hand, mostconservatives seem to
believe the family-values they preach’, which pretty
much run 180 degrees counter to the idea of tearing
apart the country for the sake of personal gain.

Sen. Trent Lott, who gave the Republican
response to Clinton’s State of the Union address
Tuesday night, talked only about the issues and, like
most of the Republican party, made no mention of the
scandal. They know as well as Bill Clinton that it
would have been inappropriate. They know it’s hurt-
ing everybody — not just the president, not just his
family, not just his’ administration, not just the
Democratic Party, not even just politicians, but the
whole country. i

In a medical mecca such as
Pittsburgh, it isn’t surprising that
the community here is very aware
of and very opinionated on issues
in health care. Various marches’
and debates take place all year,
and some are scheduled for very
soon. While I am also very opin-
ionated on matters in the medical
ﬁeld, I ﬁnd it rather troubling
when people argue their points
with faulty evidence. One such
example is the brazen misuse of
the Hippocratic Oath as a sup-
porting document. .

Opponents of euthanasia and
abortion are perhaps the two main
groups that are guilty of this error.
Many times they argue that the
Hippocratic Oath, which they
hold as the Magna Carta of medi-
cine, clearly prohibits these acts
in any form. But, in fact, it
includes exceptions to this theory.

The actual wording states
that the physician is not to “give a
deadly drug to anybody if asked
for it, nor  make a suggestion to
that effect.” Also, it stipulates that
the doctor is not to “give a
woman an abortive remedy.”
These clauses seem to be clear-
cut pro-life sentiments to some,
but in reality, thesewords only
prohibit these acts by means of
drugs. - . -
Obviously, in this «day and
age there are many ways to go
about these practices, and not all
of them include drugs. To some,
“pulling the plug” is euthanasia,
as are DNR (Do Not Resuscitate)
orders. And today, abortion tech-
niques are typically far more

complex than giving medications.
Until the line is clearly drawn on
the definition of these acts, the
Hippocratic Oath cannot be
applied. ’
‘Abortion and euthanasia are
only two prominent examples of
this document’s misapplication;
many more exist. But even if the
arguments were properly support-
ed by the oath, it won’t amount to
much. The Hippocratic Oath is
not in any way a legal document
and does notobind the health care
industry in any way. It has no
meaning other than as a historical
work, rooted in ancient philoso-
phy. Its edicts are mostly inap-
plicable to modern medicine,

especially parts such as the one

where physicians swear they
“will not use the knife.” How
realistic is that in this era of surgi-
cal breakthroughs?

_ In addition, contrary to what,

the mainstream may think, the
Hippocratic Oath is not a ﬁxed

document, nor does it have any '

legal intonations. It holds. no
water and will get you exactly
nowhere in a call for action.

In fact, the document itself
was not necessarily written by
Hippocrates. It is merely thought
of as a representation of his
school of medicine in the fourth
and fifth centuries B.C. The actu-
al authors are thought to be mem-

' bers of the Pythagoreans, a sect of

philosophers.
The Hippocratic Oath is not

' 3S sacrosanct a WOI'k as these

activists may think. How many
doctors actually swear by it? Not
many. As of 1989, only 119 med-
ical schoolsin the U.S. swore to

any oath at graduation. Only 60 of

THE PITT NEWS

those reported administering any
form of the Hippocratic Oath, and
even then, most likely many were
spinoffs. It is looked at as a part of
medical history, with no disre-
spect held toward it. But it is sim-
ply not of great day-to—day impor-

tance in the modern medical com-_ .

munity. _

The Hippocratic Oath is one
of the most well-known and
famed writings in medicine, so

the public is frequently -exposed"

to it in bits and pieces. As a result,

the ‘public applies it‘ in the same.
fashion, in little pieces that hap- '
pen. to ﬁt its purposes without;
regard to the whole. It has been j
said that “the whole is greater?

than the sum of its parts,” and this
is a prime example. One can’t just

take what they want out of con-'

text and make it work for them.
That isn’t feasible for any docu-
ment, and deﬁnitely not for one
such as the Hippocratic Oath.

I’d like to point out that
nowhere have I stated my views 3

on any of the controversial issues.

My opinion on abortion and '
euthanasia and the like shouldn’t j

matter here. I believe that respect

for all sides of an issue should be '

maintained at all times, no matter

how vehement one may be. The .2
only exception to this is when a7
given opinion or argument is .
unsupported or, even worse, fault- 1

ily supported. Thoseactivists who

spout off references « to the i
Hippocratic Oath in their debates .

are simply abusing‘ its modern
premise. '

her own oath when she becomes a

I simply can’t decide whether
to compare Bill Clinton and his
State of the Union to a shady car
salesman‘ or a con-artist with a
pyramid scam. Beyond ﬁring out
enough promises to satisfy every
possible constituency, Clinton
pushed three proposals like.a slick
scalper: Social Security, Medicare
and child care. ,

Following the traditional lib-
eral philosophy, these proposi-
tions intend to pile more of your
money into failed programs and to
make more people dependent on
the federal government.

The Con—man-in—Chief des-
perately seeks to pour more
money into his pyramid scheme.
Social Security stands as the
biggest fraud in American history.

THERE IS ‘NO SOCIAL SECU—-

RITY TRUST FUND!

Social Security, as it stands
today, is an inter-generational
transfer of income. The money
you and I pay to the federal gov-
ernment goes directly to our cur-
rent stock of Social Security recip-
ients. In other words: welfare for
old people. Beyond the fact that

ate of the Union pro

Social Security does not even pro-
vide a living wage, even the most
optimistic estimates warn that
when it is our turn to take, we will
receive fewer beneﬁts than the
money we put in could buy.
Clinton proposes dumping
100 percent of all budget surplus
into Social Security in an attempt
to “save” it. Like a pyramid
scheme on the brink, devoting
more of our money to this pro-
gram will only delay the

. inevitable.

Every year, we expect hard-
working men and women to give

up more and more of their

incomes. At what point do we
reach a ceiling? When will we say
.“no more?” When we give up 45
percent of our money to Social
Security? Sixty percent? If no
ground-breaking reforms or
phase-outs occur, those are some
projections of what you and I will
pay. Eventually, whatever the
political or economic conse-
quences may be, we will have to
face this time bomb.

Last Tuesday night, Clinton
continued his attempts to sell a
section of Americans Medicare.
Like a car salesman binding
someone to a suspect lease, selling

 

THE PITT NEWS

Medicare to_ those between the
ages of 55 and 65 would make an
entirely new populace dependent
on the government. VV1th probable
refonn on the horizon, any sweep-
ing changes would "be severely
constrained by the insecurities of
an enormous number of people.
Furthermore, Clinton leamed his
lesson after his ﬁrst stab at social-
ized medicine was severely
defeated by a Democratic
Congress early in his presidency.
Now Clinton takes baby steps
towards an eventual federal-gov-

-emment—controlled health care

system. Such a system would halt
our competition-driven system,
which has fueled the greatest
medical and technological gains
ever seen. .
Clinton promised that under
his child care proposal, scholar-
ships and tax credits would ensure
that a family with child care bills
would not have to pay a penny in
federal income tax. Well and good
for those who choose to send their
children to day care, but what
about those who choose to take
care of their own children?
Depending on your income,
raising your child yourself could
cost you between $5,000 and

 

$35,000 in lost tax breaks. Add in
the income of the working spouse
and the government has created a
grand punishment for many par-
ents who want to- care for their
own children. Although Clinton
may want to make this decision
easier, his program will have the
opposite effect by iaising the
stakes and costs involved in the
decision. .

— indicative of his ‘deceptive

decades. Four decades of
Democratic control. Clinton had
two years to start his own agenda
to balance the budget. Not until
Republicans took control did the
idea of a balanced budget ever
come to light.

The President’s habits of
deception go beyond sex, taxes
and Whitewater. Clinton and
other liberals are in the business of
government. Big government that
wants to control the lives of its
populace. What better way to do
that than by taking your money

The drunken state — a condition
which has caused much controversy
over the past seven or eight millennia.
We all know how it’s brought about (a
maximization of. . utility on the
drin‘lcer’s part), but the.l'nirnan race has
yet to comprehend the: power of the
brain’s reaction to alcohol

Alcohol has caused?
to go wayward _ and ., ?;h'a‘voc,
caused many, a fringe pshotic to put
thought into action and caused several
half-wits at NBC to come up-, with a
travesty known as “Suddenly Susan.”

But negative effects aside, I
believe alcohol-is the gateway to a
state of higher human consciousness.

The human condition is ineffably
altered after the consumption of an
alcoholic beverage. Depending on
one’s metabolism, the process can take
anywhere between three to 17 beers,
two to 15 shots of whiskey, or two to
28 glasses of wine. Some say the
aforementioned beverages have an
adverse effect on one’s system, but for
me, reality blends in with an outer-
world — a place too tranquil to be
dreamlike, yet too raucous to be spiri-

The senses undergo a metaphysical
transformation. Audibly, the world’s
bass is pumped up. Visually, the expe-
rience is phenomenal and translucent.
The girl one occasionally glances at
from across the lecture hall can be
transformed in one’s eyes into a sexual
supernova. Buildings. swirl, street
lights dance, straight lines fold -and
fresh air intake makes one feel like
Superman.

The liquored pressure builds up,

and after enough consumption, a pyro-
‘elastic eruption of a myriad of colors

spews from one’s mouth. As British
comedian Jasper Carrott noted, unlike
other hallucinogenic substances, this
vision will still be around when one
wakes up in the morning.

These aforementioned reasons. are
probably why the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania bans under-21-year-olds
from consumption of alcohol. They
don’t want the youth of America to
have access to this kind of power.
Power in the wrong hands may have
calamitous results, but a 19-year-old’s
attempt to harness it is no different
from a nriddle-aged hobo’s attempt.

Absolut Power corrupts Absolutly,
but it won't harm the state legislature

to lower the drinking age limit to a rea-
sonable age, i.e., 18..Perhaps the
Commonwealth views we under-21-
year-olds as immature — too green in
the ways of the world
to‘ contemplate the
purchase of liquor.

weapons, be tried in
a court of law as an
adult, own abusi-

man, yet nothave a
drop of alcohol.‘

The excuses are
absurd: Allowing 18-

drink would increase the drunk—driving

claim. How odd, when these laws were

and the Panthers down 73-
70, Vonteego Cummings
was stripped by
Mountaineer guard Adrian
Pledger. Brian Lewin gained
possession of the loose ball,
and his subsequent free
throw iced the win for the
Mountaineers and sent the
Panthers reeling.

“Coming down the
stretch, they made some big
plays, and their seniors came
through,” said Head Coach
Ralph Willard. “They made
some smart decisions and
some big plays.”

Willard said that his
younger players have yet to
gain the conﬁdence that they
can beat ranked opponents
in close games.

“I think the biggest
thing with our team is the
freshmen and sophomores
have to start believing they
can win these types of
games,” Willard said.

West Virginia’s senior-
laden team controlled much
of the action in ﬁrst half,
with senior forward Damian
Owens and reserve center
Lewin dominating the action
inside. Lewin had 10 first
half points and pushed
around the ‘ younger and

Freshman forward Attila Cosby
describes himself off the court as
someone who “lays back and waits
for [his] opportunity to be playful.”

It’s not surprising that fans use
similar language when describing
how Cosby plays basketball. But
instead of saying he waits for an
opportunity to be playful, fans would

' say he waits for an opportunity to

strike.

“He’ll get some blocked shots,”
Head Coach Ralph Willard said
about Cosby last October.

Indeed he has.

During the Panthers’ first 15
games, Cosby lead the team with 22
blocks. How signiﬁcant is this? Mark
Blount, whose 78 blocks last season
rank fourth on P.itt’s all-time single-
season list, had only 27 blocks his
freshman year in 27 games (although
he played a mere 14.4 minutes per
game).

Cosby’s defensive skills don’t
end with powerful rnid-air swats at
opponents’ shots. At 6-foot-9, and
with the agility of a guard, Cosby
also has 13 steals. Considering his
height, this statistic might be even

more amazing than his "blocked '

shots.
To put this into perspective,
defensive superstar Vonteego

Cummings, who ranked among the
nation’s top 20in steals last year and
ranks among the top 5 this year, man-
aged just 15 steals in 18 games his
freshman season.

Despite what he’s done on the
defensive side of the courtthis year,
some fans think .-the- top-50 high

school recruit should be making a"

stronger contribution to the team.

His 8.3 points per contest are the
lowest of the ﬁve starters’ averages,
but his .533 shooting percentage
(second on the team, behind only
Isaac Hawkins’ .543) indicates he
isn’t taking many poor shots. In fact,
his shooting is so excellent for a for-
ward, many of his baskets come from
jump shots 15 feet away from the
hoop, where opposing big men sel-
dom roam to redirect shots.

When making more comparisons
to Cummings’ freshman season
record, in which he was an incoming
top-15 high school recruit, Cosby’s
doesn't look that bad.

He’s averaging almost two more
points per game than Cummings did.

‘ In addition, Cosby’s .533'ﬁeld-goal

percentage and .800 free-throw per-

centage are each about .170 points
higher than the numbers Cummings
posted (.333 and .667, respectively).

“My role is just to rebound,
block shots and run the ﬂoor,” said
Cosby about his contributions to the
team. “I’ll try to do what they expect
me to do.”

Willard said at the beginning of
the year that he can’t put large expec-
tations on the freshmen, especially
the forwards and centers, because
college basketball is played much
differently than high school hoops.
But if there’s one thing Willard’s
staff did expect from him when he
entered Pitt, it’s something Cosby
himself mentioned: running the ﬂoor.

When he played at Oak Hill
Academy in Washington, D.C.,
Cosby was considered one of the
fastest forwards in high school by
several recruiting services.

“For a guy his size, there’s no
one quicker in the country,” said
Steve Smith, -his coach at Oak Hill.

“He’s very talented. A lot of college’

coaches who’ve watched him think
he’ll be a pro.” .

Unlike many forwards who are
noted for their speed and athleticism,
Cosby wasn’t a late-bloomer who
played guard most of his life.

He was always tall for his age.
He was already six feet tall by the
sixth grade but wasn’t playing bas-
ketball at the time. He played foot-
ball instead.

In seventh grade, however, the
junior-high basketball coach, Al
Tyler, approached Cosby in the
school’s hallway and asked him to
try out for the team. Cosby didn’t
like the idea too much but decided to
go out for the hoops team the next
day anyway. .

That’s when his natural athleti-
cism kicked in and helped Cosby
make up for the years of organized
basketball he hadn’t played.

“As I stayed with it, I got better,”
.said Cosby. “I just kept working at
it.” .

His -mind changed about basket-
ball, and he dropped football to play
hoops full time. Over the next few

years, he grew taller and better.

By the end of his sophomore
year at DeMatha High School in
Hyattsville, Md., he was playing well
enough to be accepted at Oak Hill
Academy, one of USA Today's peren-
nial favorites as the best team in the
nation.

Although Oak Hill was six hours
from Hyattsville, he thought the
move would be a positive one for his

Sprewell’s future ultimately rests on the
gavel of Fordharn law school Professor John
Feerick —-— also known as John the Good or
St. John or whatever you may call him. .

Tuesday marked the ﬁrst day of testi-
mony, with Golden State Assistant Coach
Bob Staak, Mark Grabow, the Warriors’
director of athletic development, and
Muggsy Bogues all taking the stand

The testimony, which totaled 10 hours,
sparked NBA Players’ Association President

in New York.

‘There will be some modiﬁcation, I’m
convinced. The best outcome would be

Hunter also expressed his worries over
the idea that the punishment will stand.

“If this becomes precedent, then every-
body becomes vulnerable. No one has a

’ guaranteed contract then.”

Everyone becomes vulnerable?
Becoming a precedent?

, This punishment has no precedent
because the crime has no precedent.

How could P.J. Carlesirno ever coach a
player like Latrell Sprewell ever again?
How co11ld anyone in the Warriors organi-
zation, other than players, even sympathize
with Sprewell?

If the punishment is reduced, ’ then
what? '

Trade him before the upcoming dead-
line.

Release him. .

Those are about the only options
Golden State has, and they aren’t too appeal-
mg.

The Warriors were bad with Sprewell
and have grown a lot worse without him, but
they have to take a stand. Hey, maybe there
are some teams out there who would take a
chance on the ill-tempered Sprewell, but
what would they be willing to give up?

And what coach would be greeting him
with open arms?

We will know the answer to these ques-

tions and many more no later than March _

16. Each side has 10 days after the initial rul-
ing to appeal, and Feerick has 30 days after
that appeal to make a ﬁnal decision.

Since the incident, Sprewell has severe-
ly changed his stance on the issue.

When the" NBA suspended his for an
entire year, he said that it wasn?t a big deal
and that he would; survive in the CBA, over-
seas or without basketball altogether:

A couple months full of paydays has
caused Sprewell to change his tune and
think about his “aggressiveness.”

‘This has taught me a lot about my J

aggressiveness. I've learned I’ve got to take
control of it I’m working on it.” V
What a guy.

and thinks Sprewell should listen more to

Cinderella.

That made the dilference in this game.”

Although the stat sheet said that both
teams were even with 33 rebounds on the
night, that same piece of paper didn’t com-
pare ﬁrst half rebounding with second half
rebounding. The Panthers had a paltry
seven rebounds in the ﬁrst 14 minutes of
play, as compared to WVU’s 14.

At that same point in the ﬁrst half,
Pitt’s leading rebounder was Isaac
Hawkins. He had two.

then made a valiant eﬂort to save the ball
before it went out of bounds. A

Rookie goalie/treasurer in

Men's lacrosse, has one
goal: Win a championship

Matt Townsend

Asslstant Sports Editor

A new coach.

New uniforms.

And a new attitude. _

No, this isn’t the 1997 Pitt football
story, but it has all the same beginnings.
And what a difference a year can make.

After last year’s 12-3 season and first
round elimination in the National
Collegiate Lacrosse League tournament,
Pitt’s men’s lacrosse team opted for a
coaching change. Out was Gary Nell“, the
founder and coach of Pitt’s 9-year-old
lacrosse team, and in as coach was former
player Rob Heaps.

“We felt as a team we were becoming
complacent,” said Captain Brian
Novotny. “We were always one of the bet-
ter teams in the league, but we couldn’t
get over the edge to the next leve .”

The younger Heaps is more in tune
with the players. His hiring has lead to
improved communication in the
player/coach relationship.

“\V1th Gary, there was always a
breakdown in communication,” said
Novotny. “But Rob knows us better, and
because he’s younger he’s easier to relate
and talk to.”

Communication and team unity are

two traits stressed by Heaps. Lacrosse is a
team sport that relies on extensive and
precise teamwork to be successful. And to
improve team cohesiveness, Heaps has

encouraged the players to spend as much"

time as possible with one another.
“Coach always want us to be togeth-

ond in its division after an overtime
loss to first-place Ohio State. It did,
however, qualify for the playoffs.
“We’ll be back in the playoffs
this year,” said Coach Neff. He is
facing a difficult challenge. The team
is fairlyyoung with a lot of first-year
players and a new goalie. The team
also will be without two veteran
stars, Laura Wilhilm and Ketty Rugh,
who are studying abroad in England.
“Our goal is to bring everyone up
a level in play,” said Vice President

Alisa Diaz. To do this, the team of 21
started practicing the week after
returning from the holiday break, and
they continue to practice twice a
week in the Cost Center.

“We are going to be good. I am e

bringing in a new system,” said Neff.
Involved in this new plan is club
treasurer/goalie Leigh Anne
McGowan. This is her first time as
goalie for the team and she i_s only
going to get better, according to
Neff.

“I give [McGowan] a lot of cred-

McGowan faces balls coming at her

Pili grapplers tune up versus unranked opponents

Brian Knavish

Staff Writer

The Panther wrestling team is cur-
rently ranked .19th in the nation. That’s
nothing to be ashamed of, but that

ranking doesn’t measure up to this

team’s expectations.

“It’s kind of ironic that you’d be
disappointed with [a ranking of] A 19th
in the country, but we’re not happy
with that,” Head Coach Rande
Stottlemyer said.

Coaches, wrestlers and experts
agree that the 1997-98 Panther squad
could be the best in recent school his-
tory. The team has ﬂirted with the top
10 most of the season, and by slaugh-
tering Clarion and Ohio State (two
solid teams that normally show up in
the top 25), the team has proven it has
the ability.

But disappointing losses against
less-than—solid squads, including
Central Michigan and Augsburg,
caused the drop to 19th.

This is a pivotal point in the sea-
son for the Panthers. They wrestle four
weak schools in the next three days
before embarking on a stretch run that
will pit them against- ﬁve nationally
ranked teams in their ﬁnal ﬁve match-
es of the year.

“That’s a pretty good _ﬁ_restorm,”
Stottlemyer said. “It’ll pretty much
determine the success or failure of our
dual meet season.”

That stretch run is both a huge
challenge and a huge opportunity for
the Panthers. Winning four or five of
those matches should put Pitt in -the
top 10. .

es. They wrestle at EWL rival
Cleveland State tonight and then trav-
el all the way down Forbes Avenue to

n’t have new uniforms today.

“We barely get any allocated money
from the school, and the little we do get
goes to balls and nets,” said starting goalie
Dave Travis. “If we want something, we
have to do it ourselves.”

Along with creating a closely—knit
team, Coach Heaps has also instilled a
new style of play. The previous scheme
focused on the individual. A player was
encouraged to try and make plays on his
own — get the ball, take it to the cage, and
rip a shot was the game plan.

“We used to thrive on the one—on-one
matchup and did not use a lot of tearn—
work,” said Novotny.

Now the team has geared up for a
fast—paced, fast~breaking style that relies
on superb teamwork and communication.

“Our team is more about feeding
other players and assists,” said'Novotny.

The team has also instituted a more
aggressive, in-your-face attitude in every
facet of its game from passing to check-
mg.

THE PITT NEWS

“It’s like going from ﬂuff to gritty,”
said Travis.

Heaps is intense and demands the
same intensity from his team. He benches
players for missing practice and doesn’t
accept fundamental breakdowns. Passes
should be caught, and open shots should
be made.

‘Teams drop passes all the time, but
with Rob, a pass is automatic, andnow
we all think the same,” said Travis. “He’s
raised all of our team’s standards three to
four levels. It’s really been amazing.”

\V1th this new attitude, Heaps has
also raised team goals. I

“Our goal is to win a championship,
and anything else would be a disappoint-
ment,” said Novotny.

Pitt graduated just one starter (now
he’s the coach) from last year’s 12-3 (7-1
league) team. Completely intact is the
attack line of last year’s leading scorer
Marc Polecritti, Jon Lambert, Matt
Hoplarnazian, Ed Murphy and Dave
Corrado. ‘

“They are tremendous attack1nen,”
said Novotny. “I go against them every
day in practice, and they are the best I’ll
see all year.” -

the defense that should face fewer shots
because of the oﬂ°ense’s new dedication to
passing and setting up quality shots.

“We used to take a lot of quick shots,
and didn’t have ‘a lot of long possessions,”
said Travis. “The defense will be able to
get more rest this year.”

During the preseason, Pitt tallied a 4-
3 record. The difference in winning and
losing was Heaps’ presence.

“We got our butts kicked when he
wasn’t there,” said Travis.

And when he was there, they beat
reining league champ Ohio University at
their own tournament.

Novotny explains, “He’s hungry to
win, and his dedication and enthusiasm
rubs off on us.”

The team opens its home schedule on
Feb. 12 at 7 p.m. at the Cost Center.

The team is in a league consisting
of 30, teams from New York to
Minnesota. It plays anywhere from nine
to 13 games a seasongdepending on
how well it fares in tournaments.

Such tournaments are often al‘l—day
affairs called “play-days,”-where 10 or
more squads play in one single—elimi-
nation event. With a win, the team
advances; a loss results in a trip home.
Pitt hosts one such tournament on April
3-4. Like the team’s first home game on
the 19th of February, it will be held at

GAME

the Mountaineers’ points came on sec-
ond-atteinpt put-backs and Panther
turnovers. Pitt had 12 first half
turnovers, including six by Cummings.

Pitt clawed back in the middle of
the half, lead by J arrett Lockha1’t’s nine
first half points. An Attila Cosby lay—in
and subsequent Lockhart three—pointer
brieﬂy tied the game at 28 before a late
surge by West Virginia pushed its lead
to 33-30 at halftime.

Pitt’s offense settled down in the
second half. A slashing basket and free
throw by center Isaac Hawkins capped
off a 14-2 Panther run early in the half,
giving the Panthers a 49-43 lead, their
largest lead of the ball game.

“I thought we played very good
defense in the first half,’’ Willard said.
“In the second half, I thought we played
much better offense.”

Pitt was led in the second half by
Lockhart, who scored 11 of his 17
points in the second half. Cummings,
Pitt’s leading scorer at 19.5 ppg, also
scored 11 of his 17 points in the final
period.

THE PITT NEWS

Jarrett Lockhart (#12, driving) led the team with four three-pointers last night-.

West Virginia showed its experi-
ence late in the half as it clawed its way
back into the lead, 58-56, thanks to con-
secutive jumpers by its star forward
Owens.

A Hawkins’ goaltending off a
Cummings miss prevented the Panthers

from gaining more than a two point
advantage down the stretch and two
free throws by Owens with 1:26

crucial basket. ‘

BOARDS

much strength on the boards in the early
half of the game, either. The ﬁrst—half
shooting game for both teams was off, and
the rebounding game took a little while to
get on track  only about three or four min-
utes.

Three opportunities came and went for
West Virginia, all involving Brent Solheim.
The senior forward made two or three or
four rebounds on the same possession on a
number of occasions but couldn’t sink the
easy two points, largely due to what
Lockhart called “tight” Civic Arena rims.

Solheim ﬁnished with seven rebounds
on the night, behind Brian Lewin’s team-
leading eight

But soon, the WVU rebounding game
tightened up as well as their scoring game.

Finally, Solheim’s play tightened up.
Led by their star forward (who had a team-
leading 16 points to complement his seven
boards), the Mountaineers would eek out
the win in the ﬁnal minutes of the game.

“Solheim’s start was magniﬁcent,”
said Catlett “Brian Lewin also played a big
game on the boards, but overall our inside
game was tough.”
