Quarterback Tino Sunseri granted a sixth year of eligibility  

RJ Sepich
FIFA 13 Legend

In a shocking move, the NCAA has granted
Pitt football quarterback Tino Sunseri a
sixth year of eligibility, citing a new rule
that allows three-year starters to come
back for an’ extra year at college if they
accept.

Previously, sixth years'of eligibility
were given only when a player suffered

at the same university. .

This NCAA decision reportedly led for-
mer Pitt linebacker Adam Gunn to peti-
tion for an unprecedented seventh year bf
eligibility, but there has been no word on
whether or not the University will accept
Gunn’s plea. .

Upon hearing the news, a jubilant
Sunseri immediately drove to the team’s
South Side practice facility to rejoin his
teammates for spring drills, and he hopes
to participate in Pitt’s spring game later
this month.

The race for mayor of Pittsburgh might
have just turned into a battle of black and

Let there be (some) light: Group maintains Pitttradition

Em Maier
President of Eve~ry2f/zing

The Student Government Board has been
preparing for the arrival of next month’s
sequester with spirit.

A group of cuts to federal spending,
including Pitt subsidies, will result in a re-

I . duction of ﬁrnds allotted to the Cathedral ‘

of Learning’s beloved Victory Lights. As a
result, the University will no longer utilize
the lights to signal Pitt athletic triumphs.

But one small group has decided that
school spirit will survive.

Americans for Informed Victory Com-
mittee, a new SGB committee comprised
mainly of over-peppy cheerleaders and
exuberant band members, has devised a
plan to overcome the sequester’s effects

Ilillman-Patio restoration completed

Kenny Ong
There Is An Idea to Kenny Ong

The twisting, bumpy and almost four-year-
long epic ofHillman Patio’s renovation end-
ed yesterday with much deserved pomp and
circumstance: a ribbon—cutting ceremony
complete with free pizza, OCC credit and a
performance by local Pittsburgh band White
Like Fire.

Members of the class of 2013 received
special VIP passes to the event, which
granted them prime patio seating, addi-
tional pizza, access to an open bar and extra
personal attention from Vice Provost and
Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey.

Humphrey also made a brief speech be-
fore 7-foot basketball player Steven Adams
loaned her his XXXL shears for the ribbon
cutting.

In her speech, she explained that the
class of 2013’s Pitt Student Experience in
the Research University surveys all shared
the feeling that, despite an eventful four
years at Pitt —— which included the Snowpo—
calypse, G-20 riots, bomb threats and the
year of Four Loko ——- “the Pitt experience

could not be complete without a ﬁnished
Hillman Patio.”
For motivation, Humphrey organized
a special Dean’s Hour for the construction
workers. She also claimed that the free food

and Frisbees gave the workers the “extra 110‘ s ‘ ’

percent to get the job done before gradua-
tion.”

One student in attendance said she
couldn’t wait to study for her ﬁnals on the
patio.

“The patio is just what ‘Club Hillman’
needs to take Pitt to the next level and com-
pete with the South Side club scene,” junior
Sami Archibald said.

Another student trying to make the leap
for Student Government Board president
claimed he would incorporate the patio
into his future SGB campaign platform by
promising to put a petting zoo within its
boundaries. ‘

White Like Fire closed the ceremony with a

a cover of Nickelback’s “Photograph” in re-
membrance of the many stray cats that died
from trying to take shelter under the patio’s
ﬂoor tiles during Pittsburgh’s harsh winter.
Many attendees held phones and lighters
aloft as the band played the powerful ballad.
Some attendees choked back tears.

At the conclusion of the song, Humphrey
pulled up in a shuttle for students who re-
ceived too much OCC credit at the open bar.

“I’m beyond satisﬁed that I could play a
small part in giving the graduating class of
2013 a very eventful, well—rounded four years

’ to look back on,” Humphrey shouted from

the window as she pulled away in the shuttle.

Senior Joe
Pathﬁnder said he’s just an average stu-
dent frustrated by the threat of losing
school traditions and being known as
a Division I school that “can’t even cel-
ebrate its wins.”

“I was on Reddit the other day and
heard we could make some sort of sug-
gestion to SGB or something,” he said.
“I don’t know who they are, but here’s
a suggestion — get us back our lights.”

 

Dean Humphrey slices through the celebratory‘ ribbon,which serves as
logistical nightmares. Bobby Tizial Master of Logistics

Louderback recently stressed the im-

‘ portance of responding to student sug-

gestions and, with that in mind, he and

the committee members designed a plan b

to replace the Victory Lights.
According to drafts of the plan, a stu-
dent will stand at each window in the
top 10 stories of the Cathedral with a
ﬂashlight at the ready. After a signal,
the ﬂashlights ——- colored with blue or
gold cellophane —— will blink on and off,

creating a bright display in each of the /4

windows.
Jeffrey Smiggins, president of the

iGreen Fund Advisory Board, explained

that GFAB would join the Allocations
Committee in funding the plan, which
he said is very cost-efficient. _
“Each ﬂashlight is only $46, and since
we plan to have students use rechargeable
batteries to conserve power, the Univer-
sity will be able to feature us on their new
Sustainable Pitt website,” Smiggins said.
Allocations Chairman Alex Maj chrzak
agreed with Smiggins. ‘ '
H “We don’t just fund for anything, but
at the end of the day, there’s nothing less

' disposable than happiness,” Majchrzak V

said. I

Election code revisions

divide Board, chairman

Proposed revisions target mega-slates

Mahita Gajanan
Stzyff Writer

The current elections chairman
of Pitt’s undergraduate Student
Government Board says that re-
visions need to be made to the
Board’s Elections Code to make
the elections process fairer. But
the current Board, the majority of
whose members beneﬁtted during

their campaigning from rules that ‘

are likely to be amended, stand in
opposition to the proposed revi-
sions. '

Elections Committee Chairman
Aaron Gish, a junior molecular bi-
ology major, sees ﬂaws in the cur-
rent elections code that he thinks
open the door for a potentially un-
representative balance of power
on the Board, and he wants to in-
stitute several changes to the code
before the November 2013 elec-
tion. Gish approached the Board
with his proposal in ‘early March,
but he and the SGB members have
not been ableto reach a consensus '

on the revisions. - ‘

The thrust of the disagreement
has tovdo with Gish’s proposed
alterations to elections rules re-
garding the formation of slates
or formal alliances between‘ small

code and trying to ﬁnd any way to
get around the code to work it to
their advantage,”‘Gish said.

As elections chairman, Gish is
responsible for overseeing SGB’s
Elections Committee, which is re-
sponsible for “conducting a fair,
honest, and efficient campus-wide
election,” according to SGB elec-
tions by-laws. Gish has the ability
to revise the elections code — the
rules and regulations which govern
the ways in which SGB candidates
gather support, present their ini-
tiatives and otherwise campaign
for their spots —— for the upcoming
election, provided his revisions
pass a majority vote by the Board.

V According to Gish, SGB mem-
bers are currently opposed to his
proposed changes to the elections
manual —— particularly the portion
that entails eliminating the part of
the slate system that allows slates
to endorse each other and form
mega-slates. The revisions can
only passconce meetings between
Gish and the Board point toward,

a resolution. In order to reach this ‘

point, the two parties will meet to
determine the potential of the revi-
sions passing and hold informal
votes and: discussions. The ﬁrst
of these meetings took place last
Thursday. Once the code is revised
in a way that suitably addresses
the Board’s concerns, the revisions

 will be taken to public meetingand

voted on a formality. V _

Fire at Oakland apartment displaces 13 Pitt students

Megan Trimble
14ssz'5tamf News Editor

Senior Elizabeth Roth left her Central Oak-
land apartment for the gym early Friday
morning and dismissed the calls from her
neighbor as she worked out.

Then she received text messages — her
apartment was on ﬁre.

“I ran down from the Pete in a mix of
shock and hysterics,” Roth said. “When I
got there, there were multiple ﬁretrucks,
police officers and ambulances. The scene
was complete confusion and chaos.” \

The Pittsburgh Fire Department bat-
tled a ﬁve—alarm ﬁre after arriving at 7:50

a.m. to an apartment on the 500 block of
Zulema Street on Friday. The crews stayed
on site until early afternoon and worked
to contain and extinguish the ﬁre within
the three—ﬂoor building. Pittsburgh arson
investigators deemed the ﬁre a result of an
electrical problem in the ceiling of a base-
ment apartment.

The ﬁre left 13 Pitt students displaced
and Roth and her fellow tenants ‘with gut-
ted apartments.

“I lost absolutely everything. I have noth-
ing,” said Roth, who had left her apartment
with only her phone, iPod, wallet and keys.

The University and Pitt students in-
stantly began efforts to aid those who were
displaced.

Vice Provost and Dean of Students
Kathy Humphrey was on site Friday as Pitt
spokesman John Fedele said he imagined

‘University officials “[were] scrambling” to

create housing, clothing and textbook ac-
commodations for the displaced students as
they had in the past after other off—campus
housing incidents.

Since the incident, Fedele said some
displaced students have been placed in
residence halls such as Ruskin Hall, while
others have opted to stay with friends.
According to Fedele, the University also
allowed the students to get warm clothes
from the Pitt Shop and deposited $100 into
their Panther Funds accounts for their in-
cidentals. '

Roth said she has arranged with Panther
Central to stay in Lothrop Hall and will use
textbooks on loan from the University for

' the remainder of her senior year.

Senior Shannon Ritchie said that, like
most people, her morning routine includes
checking Facebook, where she ﬁrst saw
pictures of the ﬁre. Ritchie, with the help
of Pitt’s School of Education Applied De-
velopmental Psychology program and the
Child Development Association, made a
Facebook page titled “Help Those Affected
By Oakland Fire On Zulema” for donations.

The page has grown from Ritchie’s 50
invites to 545 people attending at the time

blue to show our support for the amazing re-
search and outreach that Autism Speaks does,”
Robinson said.

So far, APO has raised‘ more than $3,200
during March because of its fundraising efforts
of selling merchandise and letter writing.

APO was founded in 1925 at Lafayette Col-
legelin Easton, Pa., as means to continue the
ideals of the Boy Scouts. It became a national

According to Autism Speaks’ website, au-
tism is a general term for a group of complex
disorders that affect brain development. It’s
characterized by difficulties in social interac-
tion, verbal and nonverbal communication

and repetitive behaviors. The U.S. Centers for _

Code, a major portion of his proposal in-
volves adjusting the slate system of elec-
tions, a frequently debated element of the
campaigning process. Currently, candidates
running for SGB can form slates of two or
three members and can ally their group with
another slate to collate resources and tackle
the campaign season together.

According to Gish, for many years, the
elections code stated that slates were not
allowed to endorse each other, the reason for
the restriction being worry that the resulting
mega—slates might put independent candi-

dates or those not on large slates at an unfair '

disadvantage.'But after the Elections Com-
mittee experienced trouble enforcing the
rule outlawing unofficial alliances between
slates, former Elections Committee Chair-
woman Annie Brown proposed revisions
to the Elections Code last year to permit

F the formation of official mega-slates that

would be capable of being acknowledged,
monitored and regulated by the committee.
The revisions were approved in 2012 by a
majority vote of the Board.

Following the November 2012 election,
disagreements surfaced on the handling of
election code enforcement during the cam-
paigning process. As previously reported
in The Pitt News, infractions were ﬁled be-
tween the Fifth and Forbes and Steel and
Stone mega-slates the day of the election.
After the infractions were mutually retracted

by both groups before reaching judgment
by the Elections Committee, several par-
ties stated they felt that independent and
small-slate candidates had been adversely
affected by the truce among slates canceling
out infractions that could have reduced in
punitive vote reductions for candidates on
the day of the election.

Gish sees problems in the current slate
system that allows slates to endorse one
another. '

“Right now is we have these sister
slates where there are six candidates total
in them,” Gish said. “Youhave one presi-
dential candidate and ﬁve board member
candidates, and then you have the problem:

’ What if there are two slates that get elected

together? You have the majority of the Board
and the president getting elected together.”

Non-College of General Studies’ Pitt
undergraduate students elect eight Board
members and a president to represent them

-' each November, and the elected Board mem-
bers assume their positions injanuary. Un-

der the current system, students can vote
ﬁve candidates and a president onto the
Board.

The 2013 Student Government Board
members, who assumed their positions
in January, consist of one member of the
three-person Pitt United slate, one member
each from the Steel and Stone sister slates
and all six members of the Forbes and Fifth
sister slates, which included presidential
candidate and now-President Louderback.

Gish said that with his proposed revi-

sions, he hopes to help create a Board that
represents the diversity of the student body.
He said that the current system does not
favor such a Board because, although the
elected Board might be diverse in terms of
representing different aspects of the student
body, the personal connections between
the majority of the Board lessens the diver-
sity. He noted that when a full six—member
mega—slate is elected to office — as occurred
this year — the majority has the potential
to. overshadow the opinions of the Board’s
other three members.

As elections chairman, Gish said he feels
it is in his jurisdiction to prevent the market-
ing of alliances between slates that leads to
a potentially personally connected Board
being voted, into office.

Former Elections Chair Annie Brown said
that she, Louderback and Board members
C.J. Bonge, Dave Rosenthal and Sarah Win-
ston unanimously voted Gish to be Elections
Chair.

’ “For What it’s worth, I fully support Aaron
and his earnest attempts to mend a broken
electoral system, and I am disappointed that
the Board has been combative in their deal-

ings with Chairman Gish and-his proposed .

revisions to the Elections Code,” Brown said
in an email. '

Proposed changes
To address the issues he sees with the
elections process, Gish offered some po-
tential changes to the section about slates
V elections code;

— Mega slates cannot seek endorsements,

as a joint force

- Slates cannot have similar names

— Slates cannot promote themselves as
a collective '

— The presidential candidate will run for
the position alone, unattached to a slate

While the potential slate changes are
under debate between Gish and the Board,
Gish said that the Board and the Elections
Committee agree on several other changes
he has proposed to the code. For one, he
said there is a general agreement that all
candidates and slatesshould step away from
asking academic departments to endorse
candidates.

“We’re here primarily to learn as a ﬁ1nc-
tion of the University and when you have
academic departments making statements
about who they endorse, it can lead to con-
ﬂicts ofinterests within the departments,”
Gish said.

Conﬂict arose this past election season
when, several weeks after the election, The
Pitt News reported there were allegations
of slates requesting endorsements from
academic departments that had already
endorsed competing slates —— a campaign
-action forbiddenby the Elections Code.

Gish also hopes to crack down on rules
involving student organizations that en-
dorse candidates. One modiﬁcation Gish
would like to see in the code is that once
an organization reaches a certain limit of

endorsements, other candidates can’t seek
endorsements from that group.

Other adjustments involve making clear
rules about infractions so that all candidates
can have an idea of what types of infractions
are considered “serious” and the sanctions
they might experience as a result of Elections
Code violations. For relatively small infrac-
tions, Gish said he would like to hold weekly
hearings during the campaign season so that
the complaints are dealt with transparently.

“What I think this will do is stop that
‘Cold War’ mentality [of mutual suspicion],
and candidates would have a more general

idea of what kind of infractions could be
ﬁled against them,” Gish said.

Furthermore, Gish is adding more rules
in the code to make certain gray areas more
speciﬁc. For example, he is proposing that
only campaign managers and candidates
themselves can seek endorsements and put
up posters. Gish also plans to create rules
for the use of social media in the election.

By deﬁning boundaries, Gish said the
code will put more responsibility on cam-
paign managers and candidates.

Changes can be instituted to the Elec-
tions Code up to eight weeks before the elec-
tion in November, but Gish aims to have his
revisions passed by the end of the spring
semester. He reasoned that people who are

currently considering running for a Board
position next term have not yet considered
potential slates at this point, making the
changes more seamless in their implemen-
tation.

“I feel that it’s a good thing we get it done
before the fall because the sooner we get
it done, the less political the process is,”
he said. ~

The Board’s reaction

The elections code revisions are cur-
rently on theirﬁsecond draft. The Board met
with Gish last Thursday night to go over the
proposed changes.

anonymous actions across campus.

In the infraction, Gish calls for a “full as-
sessment” of whether he held the authority to
make his statements or if doing so reflected a
bias in his position.

“If my statements were inappropriate, or if I
have shown any appearance of bias against the
Druids speciﬁcally, then President Louderback
has not infringed on my committee’s autonomy
and is therefore within his rights to address
the situation,” Gish wrote in the complaint,
obtained by The Pitt News.

Louderback, who was informed about Gish’s

- concerns through Brause, said that any sense

of bias among committee members must be
discussed, but he thought that he had reached
an understanding with Gish after his own per-
sonal correspondence with him.

“In my mind, and perhaps I should have
voiced this more clearly, there was a sense of
potential bias and [Gish] clariﬁed there was not
one, so we were set to move on,” Louderback
said. “He may have interpreted my intentions
differently, but I had no intention of threaten-
ing or anything like tha .”

Louderback said that he and Gish corre-
sponded over telephone call, text message and
in person to discuss the issue and concluded
that it would have to go to hearing to reach
appropriate closure.

- Despite this, Louderback said he never in-
tended to ﬁle an infraction against Gish.

“He asked one to be ﬁled against him, and
he would ﬁle one against me, but I didn’t feel
like that was the proper or professional way
to do things,” Louderback said. “I didn’t have
grounds to form a complaint, and I wasn’t go-
ing to have one ﬁled against him for the sake
of ﬁling.” A ‘

Louderback said he will submit a formal
statement to thejudicial Committee on where
he stands and plans to call for a tribunal to
hold an oﬁicial discussion in place of a judicial
hearing.

In the infraction, Gish suggests that the
hearing go to a tribunal as an alternative if all
agree that doing so would “be possible and
more appropriate.” Should Louderback be
found guilty, Gish suggests that no sentence
should be enforced by thejudicial Committee.

All infractions can be withdrawn by their
ﬁler. I

COLUMN " .

Focus on how academia and
commerce Work together ,

Daniel Okwaisie
Columnist

Among the despicable and unre-
warding aspects of teaching that
instructors experience through-
out their careersis the disparag-
ing remark that “those who can’t
do, teach”—- a presumption that
their profession is just the result
of a failureto apply themselves
in the bustle of the commercial
world. Recently, I heard the rein-

carnation of that statement when"

a student mocked his entrepre-
neurship instructor for not having
started something himself. How
can an instructor teach entrepre-

neurship when he doesn’t have _a

business or venture himself?
Though perhaps distasteful,
this question is not illogical, but

A the lack of a concrete answer

means that this criticism will
continue level against academia
as a whole.

That sentiment is even shared
within academia itself. Pitt’s re-

gional campus in Johnstown ad—.
. opted the motto “Get ready for the

real world”— a tacit admission
that the workings of academia are
not part of the real world; that the
process of knowledge exchange

andpropagation in academic
settings is not considered part of
the “real world.” By implication,
a career in an academic setting is
what will become of someone who
doesn’t cut it in the real world.
Yet if we remind ourselves of

what academia is, it is easy to see. °

that not only has its deﬁnition
narrowed, but alsoits relationship
with the real world has turned on
its head. Academia is concerned
with the propagation of knowl-
edge, but -it is not restricted to

‘teachers and students in lecture »
' halls. It includes the research or-
ganizations and commercial con-

sultants Who do research, churn
data and analyze historical statis-
tics to inform government policy
and even businesses themselves
how to act. Hence, academia does
not play second ﬁddle to the real

world; it actuallygruns the real '

world because without it, the

real world ‘lacks the knowledge V

to function..

It would be impossibleto _tell,_
however,_ that academia runs the
real world just by looking at the

sort of comments an academic

such as The New York Times’ Paul
Krugman receives on his columns.
As an economist, Krugman studies
data and often advocates that for

the economy to thrive, the govern-
ment shou-ld tax businesses more
so it can have resources to spend
on investments. In their frustra-
tion, his opponents accuse him of
being ignorant about how busi-
nesses run because he has never
started or had to run one before.
‘This rift between academia and
business is profound because it
gives us insight to how the com-
mercial world views academia. It 
thinks academia owes it when the.
reciprocal is*the truth. In other
words, because there is a huge
supply of graduates these days

V clamoring for the limited posi-

tions available, the commercial
world feels that these products of ’
academia are at their mercy when,
in fact, businesses’ need academia
to produce capable people and

“hire them. Ultimately, academia

plays second ﬁddle to the real
world because knowledge is be- 
littljed as a good. When we realize
that knowledge is a merchandise
in itself — just like the iPhone
— then the situation changes.
In essence, an entrepreneurship
instructor who does not own a
venture but has put in the effort
to research and acquire compre-

' hensive knowledge of those who have, has.

actually created a merchandise knowledge.

Now, if we agree that knowledge is power

and money is also considered power, then

by‘ transitivity it follows that knowledge is

money. If academia is to ease the burden

on graduates, it would have to take that-
transitivity literally.

In an age of potentially persistent unem-
ployment, perhaps academia can save the
day by encouraging graduates to translate
knowledge directly into money, if indeed the
prevailing literature is true that fewer j obs
will be available as a result of businesses
replacing human labor with machines. So,
instead. of staying unemployed for months
after graduating with a physics degree be-
cause you aretrying to enter the workforce‘
of tangible products, new graduates can do
extensive research into lightly explored sub-
jects in physics and then sell thatlwork itself.

It might be a little impractical, but if
indeed unemployment today is part of a

longer trend toward a knowledge economy, -

new graduates must get used to viewing
academia this way. There might be a positive
correlation between how fast the economy
evolves into being knowledge—based and
how much of the workforce has to stay in
academia. In turn, the world of academia
becomes more applicable by the day. I

LETTER TO THE EDITOR I

To the Editor,

I have become increasingly concerned
by the overwhelming engagement stu-
dents have shown toward the upcoming
elections on May 21. I don’t really get
what the big deal is. Sure, the mayor has
influence over everythingfrom parking,
to the Port Authority or even to a possible
tax on tuition; I just don’t see how any of
that stuff affects the day-to—day lives of
most students. , _'

Sure, we hear all the time that students
don’t participate enough in local elec-
tions, but I just don’t know-why anyone
should be concerned thatin 2005 the

average voting age of the city was more
than 50 years old. I mean, come on, so_
what? I’m sure we all agree with those
folks onthe issues, they’l1 vote the way
students care.

Never mind the enthusiasm, Ijust
can’t get over how knowledgeable some
students are. I mean, I love a good meme
as muchas the next guy, but allthebse
Tumblrs and images dedicated to mayoral
candidates is getting out of hand. I feel
like I can’t log into Facebook anymore
without being barraged by everyo_ne’s
choice for mayor. And ifl see one more
Twitter tussle about the pros and cons of
providing tax increment ﬁnancing deals

to projects that don’t incorporate adap— «

tive reuse, I might give it up altogether.
My point is, students are simply tak-

ing this local election way too seriously.

Come on, we’r.e just selecting the head of
a major U.S. city. It’s not like were voting
for homecoming or anything.

Strong pitching helps Pitt sweep Towson

Nate Barnes
Senior Staﬂ Wrz'ter

The Pitt baseball team extended its winning
streak to eight games over the weekend,
sweeping the Towson Tigers at the Petersen
Sports Complex in a non-conference series.
The three victories continue the Panthers’
recent successful spell and maintain the
team’s momentum with a crucial Big East
series against_South Florida looming this
upcoming weekend.

No. 30 Pitt_(19-6) capitalized on an
exceptional overall performance from its
weekend pitching rotation to earn three
wins against Towson (13-13). Pitt’s three
starting pitchers — juniors Ethan Mildren,
Matt Wotherspoon and Rhys Aldenhoven
— combined to pitch 25 of the 33 innings
played, allowing just two earned runs all

weekend, which head coach Joe Jordano .

said contributed .to Pitt’s success.

“The pitching staff, when you look at
24 innings [on Friday], nine [on Saturday],
that’s 33 innings we used ﬁve pitchers,”Jor—
dano said. “They were efﬁcient. They didn’t
pitch ‘excessively in terms of pitchcounts,
pounded the zone, just did a great job against
a very good tearn.” H ‘

The pitching over the weekend reﬂects
the team’s fantastic start on the mound, with
the aforementioned starters racking up a
14-2 record and an aggregate earned run
average of just 3.04 so far this year. A

Pitts, Towson 2

In the opening game of "the" series, Mil—,

dren (5-1) pitched a complete game while al-
- lowing only two runs on six hits and striking

out six Tiger batters. With Mildren holding . 

Towson down at the plate, Pitt notched a 5-2
victory to begin Friday’s doubleheader with
the help of some late-inning offense.

. Towson took an early lead in the ﬁrst in- *

ning, but Mildren silenced the Tigers’ bats
while the offense pushed Pitt to a 5-1 lead
before ‘Towson scored a run in the ninth

‘ inning. Sophomore ﬁrst baseman Eric Hess .

led the way, collecting four hits.

.Pitt 2, Towson'1 (15 innings)

In Friday’sVnight cap, Pitt tied its longest
game in program history with a 2-1 win that
spanned 15 innings ofbaseball. The contest

tied a 15—inning game played in 1948, which ,

~ saw Pitt lose to Juniata, 3-2. A

The contest ended not with a massive
scoring inning as Pitt has put together so
many times this season, but with a run
scored as a result of a commitment to fun-
damentals and playing smart baseball. .

The NCAA men’s basketball tournament is one
of the most exciting sporting events of the year.

It’s also the time when the injustice of Divi-
sion I sports becomes most evident.

During March Madness, nationally broad- *7
cast games take place in sold-out arenas and
football stadiums with millions of people
watching every’ moment on television. Yet
the players responsible for all of the action
and excitement receive none of theticket or
television revenue, which Time Warner Cable
and CBS paid around $771 million per year for
in 2010 when CBS extended the NCAA men’s
toumament’s broadcasting rights for 14 years,
beginning with the 2011 tournament.

Such ridiculousness might cease to exist

i soon because of the federal court case former _

UCLA playerEd O’Bannon brought against the‘ "A
NCAA three years ago, which has continued
to gain steam. In 2010, O’Bannon moved "to
expand the suit’s realm to all active Division
I athletes. And two months ago, a judge ruled
that O’Bannon and the others.wronged by the
NCAA —— including NBA Hall of Famers Bill
Russell and Oscar Robertson but in reality, a
majority of all Division.I athletes ever —— could
go after some of the money generated from

» their games broadcasted on TV.

O’Bannon requests that money generated
byTVget split evenly between the athletes and, _
the NCAA and that one-third of video game i
revenue go tothe athletes, meaning a" major-
ity of the proﬁts still stay with the NCAA. But
NCAA President Mark Emmert, who makes
morethan $1 million a year, andhis underlings
still ﬁght this proposal. U.S. Magistratejudge
Nathanael Cousins is currently reviewing the" »
lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the North-
ern District of California.

Current college players are aware of how
the system uses them.

cally scored the winning run.

As in the ﬁrst game, starting pitching led
the day. This time in the form of Wother—
spoon, who pitched nine innings of one-run
baseball, allowing ﬁve hits while striking
out nine batters.

Wotherspoon ﬁnished his day having

   

I thrown 125 pitches.

“Matt threw probably a few more pitches
than we would like him to, but it was really a
great performance by him,”]ordano said of
Wotherspoon. “He was throwing his break-
ing ball consistently for strikes and spotting
his fastball.” p

Wotherspoon’s performance comes as a
byproduct of the way he’s developed, help-
ing him earn his fourth win of the season.
No player has noticed said development
more than his battery mate on the diamond,
sophomore catcher Elvin Soto.

“He’s maturing after every start. You can
see him making adjustments as the year’s
coming along,” Soto said.

Pitt 7, Towson 5

A day after playing almost three full
games of baseball, the Panthers ﬁnished
their weekend slate strong with a 7-5 victory
to complete the sweep over Towson on Sat-
urday. Aldenhoven (5-0) delivered another
strong outing on the mound, not allowing a
hit until the fourth inning.

Aldenhoven ﬁnished his day after seven

innings, allowing three runs on six hits and
striking out ﬁve.

But the Tigers’ three runs offAldenhoven
came on a three—run home run by Dominic
Fratantuono in the fourth inning, which
put the Panthers in a 3-2 hole. Aldenhoven
stayed the course from there though, post-
ing zeros on the scoreboard in the rest of

iffisi 3%‘;

the innings he worked.

“Rhys [Aldenhoven] is a really good
pitcher, and today he didn’t have his best
stuff, but he battled, got the win and found
away to get it done,” sophomore outﬁelder
Boo Vazquez said.

At the plate, Vazquez was one of the play-
ers helping the Panthers come back from

 

  



the deﬁcit. In the sixth inning, Hess, junior
outﬁelder Casey Roche and Vazquez led the

inning off with singles to load the bases with q

no outs.
Hess, Roche and Vazquez each ﬁnished
with a multi-hit game, which is becoming a

consistent result for the hitters in the middle j

of the Pitt batting lineup. It’s a productJor—
dano says derives from how the Panther
hitters approach at-bats every single time
they step to the plate.

“Our approach is pretty simple, and it’s
important to us to take a very consistent and
aggressive approach,”Jordano said. “When
we’re patient at the plate, and we’re swinging
at our pitches, we’re a good offensive team.”

Pitt pushed two runs across the plate’

in the inning, scoring on a walk issued to
redshirt junior Steven Shelinskyjr. and then
a ﬁelder’s choice off the bat -of senior Sam
Parente. The Panthers didn’t look back from
there, scoring three insurance runs in the
eighth inning to take a 7-2 lead.

Redshirt junior relief pitcher J.R. Leon-
ardi worked two innings in relief of Alden-
hoven to pick up his second save of the
season and close out a 7-5 Panther victory.

As for the winning streak, Pitt’s next op-
ponent is Akron (4-20) of the Mid—Atlantic
Conference on Tuesday, with the Panthers
hoping to stretch their winning streak to
nine games before the important matchups
with South Florida on Friday, Saturday and
Sunday. _

“We’re just trying to keep winning, you
know, just keep playing good baseball,”
Vazquez said. zﬁ

sition, and the NCAA makes money
off its crown jewel regardless.
Indirectly, the latter is how

O’Bannon got the idea to sue the V

NCAA in the ﬁrst place. In 2006, he
saw that a video game featured the
1995 UCLAteam he won the national
championship with.

O’Bannon wants players to re-
ceive royalties from video game and
TV appearances in which they, their
image or their likeness are used. EA

Sports’ NCAA basketball video game ‘

series was discontinued in February
2010 not long after O’Bannon took
the NCAA to court.
Coincidence? Probably not.
Because of the NCAA’s rules pro-
hibiting student-athletes from earn-
ing money from their sports, some
basketball players have bypassed
college since the NBA implemented
the 2006 one-and-done rule, which
requires players to be 19 years old
and at least a year removed from high
school to enter its ranks. Current
NBA player Brandonjennings spent
a year playing professionally in Italy
and  schoolerAqui1le Carr, who
originally signed to play for Seton
Hall, plans to play overseas instead.
* But not all current high—level col-
lege athletes are good enough to go

pro, and that shouldn’t rob them of
their right to receive compensation
for the service they provide.
Former Lehigh player Gabe Knut-
son, who helped his team upset sec-
ond-seeded Duke in last year’s NCAA
tournament, tweeted at Jay Bilas, a
former basketball player at Duke and
current analyst at ESPN, last Monday
asking for a free copy of Bilas’ book
“Toughness.” If Knutson didn’t pay
for the book while still a student-ath-
lete, he probably would’ve gotten in
trouble courtesy of the NCAA and its

A often—arbitrary rules.

“Now thatthe NCAA no longer
owns me, can I‘ get a free copy of
#toughness?” Knutson asked Bilas.
“Big men gotta stick together haha.”

Statistics show that college
athletes in the two most proﬁtable
sports -— football and men’s bas-
ketball —- can'be worth millions of
dollars.

According to a recent academic
study, the average Division I men’s
basketball player has a fair-market
value of roughly $1.06 million over
the four years he plays, not including
the full scholarship. That ﬁgure in-
creases at Bowl Championship Series
schools such as Pitgc to $1.5 million.

According to Michael McCann, a
legal analyst and sports law writer for
Sports Illustrated and director of the
University of New Hampshire’s insti-
tute for Sports and Entertainment

Law, O’Bannon isrft proposing that
athletes receive compensation while
they are in school, but that money
should become available to them in
a sort of trust upon leaving school.

This way, the sacred status of the
student-athlete wouldn’t be com-
promised should O’Barmon win his
lawsuit. - ‘

As it stands, when athletes sign
up to play NCAA sports, they sign a
waiver that keeps them from mak-

ing money the next four years from '

their achievements, allowing others
to reap the beneﬁts.

“For lack of a betterterm, you are
signing your life away,” O’Bannon
said in a recent New Jersey Star-
Ledger column. “They get all the
revenue, and you can’t even get a

‘ job on campus to pay your expenses.”

“A 17-year-old kid doesn’t know
what he’s doing, and to sign some-
thing of that magnitude without le-
gal representaﬁon is manipulation
the second you’re handed the pen,”
O’Bannon added. “When you sign
a letter of intent, you just want to
play ball — that’s where my mindset
was.”

The trial beginsjuly 9 of next year.

Until then, let the NCAA enjoy its silly '

commercialsand catchphrases as the
time approaches when its_ founda-
tion, built on hypocrisy, will crumble.

Some of the Board members do not see
a problem with the heavily embattled slate
system.

“I think the current slate system is in
place for a reason, and although I really do
respect [Gish’s] initiative to change it, we
need to discuss new conﬂicts that arise with
changing the slate system,” Board member
Amelia Brause said Sunday, referring to the
potential for the formation of unmonitor—
able unofﬁcial alliances that could sprout
between candidates in the event that official
alliances are banned. ' ‘

Gish said the solution»to this issue would
be to closely monitor affiliations between
candidates and declare that during the pe-
riod of the campaign, any discussion about
the election between unaffiliated candidates
would be considered an infraction.

But Gish also acknowledged that, as one
person,he cannot police every candidate’s
actions.

Louderback also voiced his doubts about
the effectiveness of an anti—slate system.

“My personal opinion is that as long as on
Election Day you can vote for ﬁve members
and a president, candidates will collect each
other as ﬁve board, members and a presi-
dent,” he said. ~

Mike Nites, a cur_rent'Board member who
campaigned on a mega—slate with the Steel
and Stone slates, alsoldisagreed with the
banning of megaslates. He acknowledged
that people dislike them because they can
put individual candidates at a disadvantage,
but he would rather have everything that is
going on between candidates out on the table
and monitored by the elections committee.

“The same can be applied to presidential
candidates,” Nitessaid, explaining that it

would be likely that a presidential candidate ’

would just unofficially run with slates.
Nites recognized that there was a prob-
lem in having a mega—slate take over most of
the Board, but remained convinced that no
matter what the Elections Code says, there
will always be ﬁve people and a presidential
candidate running together — as long as stu-
dents are allowed to vote for ﬁve candidates."
“Maybe we need to change the rule to
say that you can only vote for three people
and a president or something,” Nites said.
Board member Sowmya Sanapala, how-
ever, who campaigned on a mega=slate Steel
and.Stone, said that she understands Gish’s
position on the matter of megaslates in terms

of wanting to ensure that a mega—slate does

not take over the Board. She said that she
disagreed with Nites and Louderback that
the answer lies in a potential change to the
voting procedure. ‘

“If there was to be a change in the voting,
1 think that students should be allowed to
vote for all eight candidates,” Sanapala said.
“In the end, it’s eight students representing
them, not ﬁve.” .

Board member Dave Rosenthal, who
campaigned on three-member slate Pitt
United, said that it is very hard to prevent
mega—slates from forming, no matter what
the elections code says.

5‘It’s really hard to regulate and unless
there is a sure-ﬁre way to prevent slates from
teaming up, you can’t put that into the elec-

‘ tions code,” Rosenthal said. “At this point, I
haven’t seen a viable way to do this.”

Boardmember John Cordier, who cam-
paigned on a mega—slate with the Fifth and
Forbes slates, said he thinks slates are help-
ful, rather than harmful to the elections
process. According to Cordier, candidates
running on slates are already working to-
gether as a group. Referring to thecurrent
Board, Cordier said that having the major-
ity of the members of the Board come from

I mega—slates was helpﬁil because everyone
is already accustomed to working in a large
group.

Board member Sarah Winston, who cam-
paignedon a mega—slate with the Fifth and
Forbes slates, said that having already been
through an election, she was trying to pic-
ture Gish’s proposed revisions to see how
they would work logistically and was still
wrestling with the idea of slates. Though she
did not know if cutting slates would be help-
ful, Winston did say that allowing students
to have more than six votes would lead to
super slates. _

Board member Thomas Jabro said that

. candidates forming alliances is inevitable
in any election, regardless of the elections
code. Jabro said that it would be difficult
.to regulate candidates who work together.

“I would rather allow for teamwork be-
cause I think that builds camaraderie with
an incoming board,” Jabro said.

Board member C] Bonge was unable to
be reached for comment.

Gish has three more weeks of public
meeting to introduce and pass elections
code revisions and meet his end of semester
deadline, but he does not remain optimistic.

“The slate system speciﬁcally has become
a very political section,” Gish said. “It’s al-
most impossible to enact any reform with it.”

Matt Singer
Senior alt correspondent ~

The University has announced that it will offer
a new program to help students research, un-
derstand and report on the sociological trend
that is the “hipster.” 

Slated to begin this fall, the University is
offering one section of the series’ introductory
class, “A M_ainstreamer’s Guide to Understand-
ing the Hipster,” which will focus primarily on
the cultural subset’s primary means of expres-
sion: music they heard about on blogs.

“I’m excited for this,” said Freddy Manx,
who will teach the class. “The pay looks pretty
good, which means I’ll be able to stop moon-
lighting as a bartender at Brillobox and really
focus on what’s important: Helping Pitt stu-
dents discover a new kind of music that really
captures the voice of rniddle-class ennui.”

Although he has not yet ﬁnished the course’s

syllabus, Manx said he intends to conclude"

with an empirical study of the rise and fall of
Pitchfork.

“This is a class about music — real music.
We’ll cover chillwave, then seapunk, and then
move all the way to trip hop,” he said. “I’m even
tryingto convince the dean to pay for the class
to go to ajapandroids concert.”

Even though Manx, who is currently re-
searching the socioeconomic effects of Tame
Impala’s album Innerspeaker for his Ph.D.,
encourages all students to enroll, there is a bit
of trepidation among some members of the
student body.

“I emailed the professor and asked if we
would be talking about Mumford and Sons at

' all, and he just sent me back this long rant and

then ended the message with atilde,” said Chad
Tibor, a junior studying communications. “I still
don’t even know what ‘lamestream’ means.”
Tibor, an active member of Greek life, said
V that when studyinganew culture, he expects the
professor and those around himto respect his.
“I went to this info session on the course,
and Iwas the only guy not in abeat—up old ﬂan-
nel. Everyone made fun of my boat shoes,” Tibor
said. “Look, I’ve been to Coachella. I’ve seen The
Lumineers in concert twice —— twice! No one
made fun of my shoes there, so what are these

‘ guys’problerns?”

He said his frustration reached its peak

Course offered for hipster culture appreciation  

Professor emerita Sidonie LeBeau lectures on the foundations of her coursework. BertrandpHustIe | Staff Instagrammer

when one of the PowerPoint slides from the
presentation instructed students to “trade in
their Ralph Lauren button-ups for Am—Appy
deep V’s,” as he recalled.

According to Manx, “Sartorial dedication
is needed for true ethnographic studies to be
successﬁil.”

There are other reports of animosity be-
tween prospective members of tlie class similar
to that experienced by Tibor.

“I was waiting outside of Manx’s_ oﬂice in
the Cathedral to ask him a question before
enrolling, and these two guys waiting there
kept making fun of my music and my Apple
headphones,” recalled Tiffany Laila, afreshman
who intends to study political science. “I don’t
even know what a buzzing band or purity ring
is, and they just kept calling me ‘Kelly.”’

“I love my Dayglow Pandora station, so I
thought thatl could deﬁnitely bring some inter-
esting ideas to class discussion, but I just donit
know if I belong in a class like that anymore,”
Laila said.

Manx said he plans to clear up any miscon-
ceptions about the class and possibly to require
an entry test for students looking to enroll.

“I’ll ask themto deﬁne simple terminology,
like resonance, dissonance, American Spirit
and tempo,” Manx said. “But the test will also
include an open-ended portion, where students
can write about the inﬂuences Snacks the Cat

‘ and Carles have had on the music world.”

When asked if he would be able to answer
the essay questions, Tibor replied, “I have ab-
solutely no idea who those people are.”

Other students are reacting positively to ‘

"\

the announcement and have used the course» it *
description available online to try to get a head
‘start in their studies.

“As soon as I read about this class, I ran out
and purchased Beach House’s entire discogra-
phy on vinyl, as per the professor’s suggestion,”
said Fiona Dough, aﬁi’th—year senior who took
a semester off to work at a co—op in Garﬁeld. '

Manx said that although he is eager for stu-
dents like Dough, he understands that he may
wind up with some students who aren’t cut out
for the class.

“My best advice for them would be to sub-
scribe to the Gorilla vs. Bear email updates,” W
Manx suggested. “It’ll be a rough ride, but
they’ll leave with a creative expression gen—ed
completed, as well as with some serious indie

cred.” — I .

Chronically Late Columnist

In today’s Internet—savvy world, social
“media is a big part of being an employer.
Your social media presence is important to
promoting your brand, and a strong social
media presence can attract driven, talented
young people to your job applicant pool.
Many corporations make the mistake
of thinking that using social media to en-
sure a strong applicant pool is as simple as
scrolling through thousands of collegiate
Facebook photos and trashing the resumé
of anyone who appears in pictures holding a
red plastic cup. Not so! When young people
with countless opportunities are deciding
" who they want to avail of their labor after
they earn their degrees, they often use the
Internet to make those decisions. Potential
employees are looking at your social media
page right now, trying to get a feel for what
kind of corporation you are.

With that in mind, you want your In-
ternet presence to reﬂect your best self.
Remember: The highest court of the United
States recently ruled that corporations are
people, so you can’t hold yourself to a lower
standard of online engagement than you
kwould a ﬂesh—and-blood person. And the

best and the brightest of your applicant
pool aren’t going to want to work for you
if you seem like the kind of person whose
calls they would screen.

Don’t get up in everybody’s business
24/7 with “promoted” tweets and Face-

"‘a"3'-book posts. If people want to see all of your

coupons and a behind-the—scenes expo on
your latest commercial, they will “like”
you. Don’t “suggest” that people like you

remind prospective employees of the fresh-
man who friend requested them repeatedly
after meeting only once at a party, appar-
ently never realizing that if they wanted to
be his friend, they wouldn’t have denied
his request three times. No one wants to
work for that guy.

Before you post a status, tweet or pic-
ture, you should really ask yourself: Does
this make me look like a complete idiot?
Many businesses’ social media strategies
include posting, at minimum, once every
day. The reasoning is, if Doritos consumers
don’t see us on Facebook every day, how
will they remember that we exist?

This is foolish. Speaking up constantly
when you have nothing to say doesn’t make
you relevant; it makes you someone Who
doesn’t get invited to parties. If you’re pull-
ing content out of your you-know-where, it
shows. It’s great to get your fans involved,
but not with ridiculous, insulting ques-
tions such as “Arriving or departing: Which
do you prefer?” and “If our fries could be
any color, which color would you choose?”
Don’t ask your fans to like your photo of
the color wheel if they ‘‘love color!” What’s
the matter with you? Are you drunk? You
should never post on Facebook drunk.

Bad behavior lives foreverlon the Inter-
net, so make sure your record is squeaky-

CORINTHIAN COLUMN

Pitt unveils new department,
course to improve students’ focus

Naomi “Violent Knight” B-bach
Senior Troll

In response to students’ lowered ability of
concentration and motivation, a new depart-
ment, the Department of Focus and Contem-
plation Studies, has been established at Pitt.

The department, derisively referred to as
the “Hippies on Yoga Mats” ofﬁce by unim-
pressed students and faculty, is housed in the

Cathedral of Learning and designed with feng ,

shui in mind to supposedly bring harmony
and a sense of relaxation. There areualsog no
desks, telephones or deadlines. Instead, the
staff meditates, practices yoga poses, strains
loose-leaf tea and sits on exercise balls while
scribbling in Moleskine notebooks.

Why the change from the usual stiff-upper-
lipped academia to endowment-supported
anything—goes philosophizing and medita-
tion? It all started when administrators took
notice of a new course called “Information

and Contemplation” taught at Washington

State University. -A

mental energy to do my homework, and I
deﬁnitely tend to procrastinate a bit. Thanks
to working on my focus techniqueslin class,
today it only took me an hour to get myself
in the right emotional place to do reading
for my other classes — of course that’s after

I went through my normal pump—up rou- ,

tine of checking my Facebook and looking
at GIFs of cute animals on Reddit. Before I
started this class, getting myself pumped to
do homework, not to mention keeping track
of my assignments, felt like so much effort
that it was completely not worth it! Oh wait,
my mom is calling. Can I qall you back?” Note:
The Pitt News was unable to contact Ott again.
Students start class by holding hands in

a Focus-Up Circle and chanting a positive
affirmation such as, “I can focus! Distract-
ing thoughts and tempting technology are
not the boss of me!” before rolling out yoga
mats to sit on during meditation exercises.
Undergraduate teaching assistant and mu-
sic major McKenna Meyer plays a calming
lull of harp music in

The course, taught
by technology pro-
fessor David Levy,
focuses on medita-
tive techniques and

online, and we de-
cided that our undergrads needed to have
something like it ASAP. The next day we set
up the department to try to help Pitt students
who are constantly challenged with divided
attention, distractedness, technology—related
ennui and existentialist crises. We pulled our
most talented professors from a number of
departments and gave them the office space of
the not-so-relevant History and Philosophy
of Science Department.”

The interdisciplinary department, which
is made up of faculty from the psychology,

' creative writing, information science and phi-

losophy departments, is piloting a ﬁve— credit,
intensive new course called “The Theories
and Application of Focus. and Concentra-
tion in the Digital Age.” Starting vwithrnext

year’s freshman class, it will be ‘a basic skills . a

requirement alongside algebra and writing.

' A small group of students who self—identiﬁed

as having ahigh rate of “digital distraction”
are taking part in the course this semester.

I In a phone interview, senior Christopher
Ott, one of the ﬁrst participants in this class,
said, “I decided to take this class because

I’m so busy all the time, and I have a ton of I

trouble focusing. Between all of my extracur-
riculars I feel like I barely have the time or

exhausted from going

out the night before,

‘cause no one can tell that I’m actually taking"

a quick nap. Even when I’m solidly in REM
sleep, I justlook totally focused.”

Assignments for the course are, naturally,

designed to improve students’ concentration

and attention, even on unpleasant tasks. In

-one assignment, students had to do nothing

but read polemical YouTube video comments
for 15 minutes without shifting their atten-
tion to any other task. Seniorjordan Buckley
said, “Even though this assignment was super
difﬁcult, I was so proud that I was able to
focus that long on something that was really
not fun..I was, like, really able to believe in

 myability to overcome the impulse to do ‘

something different.” .«

“Suddenly, I realized that Oscar was actu— "

ally quite impressive and well-rounded. I

I called my managerjoe Newbury and said,

‘Joe, you have to get down here. We have a

superstar here. .
Longo said that, as part of his career

« preparation credits, the OCC offered stu-

dents the opportunity to learn how to pre-
pare for an interview.

“I couldn’t wait to see him work "his
magic,” Soto said.

On March 1, with Soto and Newbury
both in attendance, Longo reinterviewed.
This time, as both managers acknowl-
edged, the soon-to—be-graduated student
sparkled.

“He talked about attending the 32nd an- S

nual Latin Americanand Caribbean Festi-
val as part of his global cultural awareness
requirement,” Soto recalled. “He said he
ate some kind of ‘Mexican thing’ and saw
‘abunch of ladies-in dresses dancing.’ This
man’s awareness was amazing. We knew
"this insight into Mexican things would be
helpful to customers.” _
Newbury noted Longo’s impressive
completion of 40 hours of community

V service.

“That’s on top of his roughly 17,520
waking hours as a college student, showing
he wasn’t just generous, but a pure model
of service to others,” he said. -

A little luck, a lot of skill
* Impressed by his expansive command
of culture and service, Newbury quickly ,
hired Longo as regional manager. Settling
into his job for a couple of hours, a Visit-
ing executive from a nearby IBM location
entered the Starbucks. Thinking quickly,
Longo used some of the communication
skills he mastered while participating in
occ. . 1
“Having met with a-professor at ofﬁce
hours and drafted a roommate agreement,
I knew _I had what it took‘ to effectively
communicate, both in writing and in the
speaking manner as such.’_’
That executive, Rosalind Picklesimer,
knew Longo had what it took too.
f‘After listening to him argue that he
had given me the right change and that he
had just interpreted my $5 bill differently
than what I had meant, I couldn’t help but
beimpressed by his clear mastery of the
English language and nuanced communi-
cation,” Picklesimer said.
Picklesimer ‘knew that she just-had to
“get this guy.” _ V
' 2 A few phone calls later, Picklesimer re-
ceived permission to put Longo on the ﬁrst
plane to IBM headquarters in Armonk,

N.Y. There, he would be interviewed for
the recently vacated CEO position.

“We kept getting these applicants, both
from within the company and outside, who
didn’t seem to be fully developed human
beings. They could program, exécute busi-
ness plans and think ‘strategically about
the global economy. But had they ever slept
through an opera? Or been to the Pitt Pep
Rally and Bonﬁre? I didn’t know, and, quite
frankly, there was no way for me to know.
Thankfully, with this OCC curriculum, I
had all the information I needed.” .

Longo, while excited by the opportuni-
ty, was still nervous. However, in a familiar
refrain, Longo knew he could fall back on
the intense sense of self he had cultivated
though the OCC program. ‘

“They made us take the Myers-Brigg
personality test. I got ENFP. Knowing I
had so much E, N, F and P, I knew I could
take whatever other letters came my way.”

The ultimate test a

Set in a strikingly'simple suburban,
sprawling campus, IBM headquarters
houses some of the most brilliant scien-
tists and engineers the world has to offer.

But it didn’t take long for executives
to realize that none were quite as well-
rounded as Longo. Particularly impressed
was vice president of sales, David Daigle.

“Any question we asked him, he called
upon an experience from OCC that dis-

played an active mind and authentic,
meaningful well-roundedness. For in-
stance, we asked him how he would ad-
dress disappointing third-quarter earn-

'ings stemming’ from weakness in the

Global Business Services unit. Recalling
his experience_as a board member with
the Pitt Sociology Club, which earned him
a leadership credit, he suggested a bake
sale,” Daigle said. - ’

“You could have heard a pin drop after
that answer,” he added. _

Other interviewers share similar
thoughts. One executive was impressed
that he regularly participated in a physi-
cal activity to earn his wellness credit.

-Another recalled glowingly how Longo

learned about the importance of teamwo rk
at the Panther’Leadership Summit.

Within minutes, the board had decided.
Oscar Longo would be CEO.

Looking back, Longo sees his ascen-
dance as inevitable.

“Having fulﬁlled the OCC require-
ments, like taking the final survey and
eating popcorn at an SGB meeting, I can
say I have developed highly desirable char-
acter traits and life skills.”

Without OCC, Longo said he would just
been another Pitt graduate with average
grades.

“But having completed OCC, I can say I
have so much more. Like I watched Ke$ha
at Bigelow Bash and stuff.” I

M  In an unexpected move yesterday, Todd
Graham has left the Arizona State football
program after only one season and has
hopped on the high-octane plane back to
Pittsburgh to become the new director of
Residence Life. '

‘-‘”“'*‘i“ The position, recently vacated after
Shawn Broliiks accepted an offer to become
the vice president of Student Affairs at Pitt’s
Johnstown campus, was too good an offer to

. pass up, according to a press release Gra—

~ ham sent via text message to media outlets.

“I am excited to have the chance to re-
build every bridge I burned ‘down in my 11
months at Pitt and continue to invigorate
the student body with positive messages,”
the former Pitt football coach said.

Graham also mentioned that he is look-

_ “This is my dream

; that this time,”

‘Todd, Graham

‘ mission of the Office of Residence Life,

The new director’s wife, Penni Graham,
was almost as excited as her husband to
move back to Pittsburgh, according to
tweets from the personal Twitter account
she just reopened.

“I am so excited to get back home to
Pittsburgh and reunite with so many of

the family and friends that we had to leave

behind when we left for Arizona. Todd and
I are looking forward to helping make the
entire Pitt community a better place. May-
be we can even get some dinner with the
Chrysts. and talk football,” she said in a
series of tweets. ,

had no comment on the Graham hire or the
possibility of any sort of awkward encoun-

Other applicants for the position includ-
ed -the following past and present members
of the Pitt community: former coach Dave
Wannstedt, band directorjack Anderson,
former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum and

, former point guard Carl Krauser.

According to Susan Peterson, who head-
ed the search to replace Brooks, Graham’s
positive attitude and great relationships
with the University’s higher-ups gave him
the-slight advantage.

“We’re excited about the future of

Graham said he’s going to get to work
right away to prove to students that he
really does love Pitt and is here for the
long haul.

“This is my dream job, it really is, I am
serious about that this time,” Graham said.
“Leading the larger Pitt student body will
certainly be a treat, and I look forward
to building a positive atmosphere from

Wayne, committed to Pitt in the same

I recruiting class as Sunseri back in 2908

and expressed his excitement at the news.

“Man, this is great for Tino and Pitt,”
Saddler said with a laugh. “I would’ve tak-
en advantage,of this new NCAA rule too,
but now that everyone knows I’m actually
Weezy, my record labels won’t let me play

football anymore because I’ve got a world

tour coming up in a few months.”
Sunseri hopes to improve on his stel-

lar redshirt senior season, which was by

far the best of his Pitt career. The former

Central Catholic High School passer com-
pleted 65.1 percent of his attempts last
year, throwing for 21 touchdowns and just
three interceptions — all career bests. .

, The 24-year-old quarterback also said
he has more news that will please a lot of
the Pitt fans who never fully supported
him over the years. ' '

“This year I promise to list my home-
town as Pittsburgh on game days,” Sunseri
said. “I know it irks a lot of people that I
always say my hometown is wherever my
dad is currently coaching and not where I
was born and attended high school —— here
in Pittsburgh. But be sure, that will change
this season, so yinz should be happy that
I’m proud to be a Pittsburgher!” I
