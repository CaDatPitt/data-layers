iv Relates War

Experiences

McKinley j Will Address
‘ Meeting'On Current
 ., Spanish Revolt

 

A talk, “Red vs. White,” by Robert
B. McKinley, ‘concerning the war in
Spain, will inaugurate this year’s se-

ries of Inquiry Forum meetings Mon-

day, at 12:30 o’clock in Room 107,
Alumni Hall. ,

‘Mr? « McKinley, ‘at""‘Pit‘tsburgh' ‘ attor-
ney, was an eyewitness to the opening

'— action 11'!‘ the“ ‘Spanish Rebellionz‘ " “He”

had been traveling in Irun, Madrid,
Malaga, and other Spanish cities, when
he wasﬂcaught in the thick of the
opening skirmishes. ' _ _
On "his return home, his newspaper
interviews _gave_ so graphic .a picture
of._the meaning of this conﬂict, that
he has been in demand as a speaker
before various organizations. Aided
by his background gained from Euro-

pean travel in previous years,-he has -'

made"a study of ‘the factors involved
in the Spanish situation.

Gives Graphic ‘Picture
Graduating from Princeton Uni-
versity and the University of Pitts-
burgh Law. School, he has practiced
law since 1930. From 1931 to 1933, he
was assistant to the U. S. Attorney
of Western Pennsylvania. He is now
a chairman of the Downtown YMCA

‘committee of management, and re-

sides in Sewickley.

The‘ Forum hour will be divided into
two parts. Mr. McKinley will ﬁrst
address the groups, giving his own
views. During the remainder of the
program, he will be “cross-examined”
in an open forum by students. All in-
terested students are invited to attend
the meeting.

Inquiry Forum is scheduled to meet
each week in Alumni Hall during the
ﬁfth hour. Throughout the year, out-
standing speakers will be brought to
the campus through the Forum. Many
of these speakers will also address the
Pittsburgh Community Forum which
meets each Monday night in Schenley
High School.

Ruth Belle Strothers, C37, and
James Van Kirk, C37, are co-chair-
men of Inquiry.

This Freshman Says It
With Concrete Details

Bannister Sliding, Advice, Football Talk, Pretty.Gir1 All
Combine To Give That Class Of 1940 Feeling

I am a freshman. My brother be-
fore me was a freshman. My father
and his father and his father never
weri freshmen, which makes me glad
that I am the second freshman in
our line. I felt lonesome the ﬁrst
day here. In the school where I
come from, I was somebody—editor
of this, secretary of that, winner of

this, and runner-up for that. .Here
I am just a green freshman, class of
1940. Maybe I will be a somebody
in four years.

I see another freshman, who is al-
most lost in a crowd of upperclass-
men. He wears a brown tweed jack-
et, and tweed pants. He sees me,
and we smile at each other. We are
both going down to the Cathedral.
We walk together. I slid down a
bannister in Alumni Hall. An upper-
classman comes along and looks at
me queerly. I do not know whether
he thinks it’s sacrilege, or whether
his look means envy. But anyhow, I
slide off and walk with dignity. In
biology, I keep looking at the pretty
girl who sits across fro-m me, and
hope that maybe I can meet her be-
fore the freshman dance.

Another freshman tells me he’s
fr-om Mt. Lebanon. He hopes he gets
rushed by a fraternity, and I say I
hope he does, too. "He wants to see

my notebook 'whi‘ch“cost thirty ‘cents,’

and he says it is better than this,

which cost him a dollar.

I eat lunch with an upperclassman,
and he goes in front, so I order the
same thing he does. I don’t like his
choice. Next time I will order some-
thing different. The upperclassman
tells me to stay clear of activities
until I get acquainted. Another up-
perclassman tells me later to get right
in. He says if you get right in, you

‘can get ahead further and faster,

which seems reasonable. I still would
like to meet that pretty girl in biol-
ogy.

At ﬁrst I think that I’ll go to my
home school’s football game instead
of the Pitt-Ohio Wesleyan game. I
meet Johnny Dickinson, who was all-
scholastic for three years at my home
high school. He is now an end, and
his eyes are black, although they
ought to be brown. He tells me how
the varsity fellows make the fresh
parade around the campus, and beat
them with sticks. They have to sing
a song, too. Johnny sings “My Old
Kentucky Home.” He tells me that
some fellow named Glassford demon-
strates how to play football, and that
is one of the reasons why he wears
a blac=k eye. So now, I think that I
shall see Pitt play instead of my
home school. I don’t feel homesick,
now, and I think I’ll like this school.
I still wish I knew that pretty girl
in my biology class. ‘ ' " ' ‘  " ‘

open-air Georgian Patio, barring frost
or rain. And if weather conditions
are unfavorable, there will still be the
main Georgian Room adjoining the
Patio, a ﬂoor which, reports say, can
easily accommodate a crowd of 700
persons.

Duncan’s 12-piece orchestra, fea-
turing three University men, will pro-
vide novel arrangements of popular
new tunes for dancing.‘ “Isn’t it a
miracle?,” their original theme song,
written by Bob Slack, C34, arranger,
rates with the best, while press re-
ports praise their “Organ Grinder’s
Swing” as a thing and a swing ar-
rangement of “A Rendezvous With a
Dream.” Jack Poellot, BA37, Slack,
and Duncan himself, E37, provide the
University contingent.

Tickets At Door

Duncan’s Band played engagements
at the Beach Club, Conneaut Lake,
this summer. He also lists engage-
ments at The Pines, The Club Mira-
dor, the spring formal of Pennsyl-

12 playing members, Maude Schaub,
blonde graduate of Frick Teachers’
School, and “Cross-Eyed Kelly”
Zeigler, specialty man.

Tickets priced at 25 cents will be
sold only at the door. In the tradi-

require no escorts. Stags will be
admitted, as‘ will “does,” if you can
call a female stag a doe.

“Freshman Women  s

Sing Next ,Week

Mrs..Ayars To Lead Singers
On Heinz House Steps

“Get the community sing idea, ex-
ercise your vocal chords; if you don’t
know the words, yode1.” This is the
invitation extended by the customs
committee to freshman women.

Community sings will be held Mon-
day and Tuesday from 12:30 to 1:30
o’clock on the steps of Heinz House.
Mrs. Robert D. Ayars, director of
the Women’s Choral, will lead the
singing. Green armbands are the
only ticket of admission.

This is the ﬁrst time that fresh-
man women have been given an op-
portunity to sing the songs that they
are required to know on their fresh-
man examination.

Members of the customs commit-
tee, who are sponsoring the sing, are:
Thyrsa Agness Amos, C38, chair-
man; Sylvia Briggs, C39, secretary;

At Last! Panther
To Get A Name!

Pitt's official football program,
The Panther, will have a snappy
new creation of the Panther, the
animal gentleman ('3) who rides‘
through victory and defeat with
the Sutherland charges, at tomor-
row’s opener.

Sad to report, the be-whiskered
gent (or lady) has no name. So
Frank Carver, Stadium publicity
director, and the Pitt athletic de-
partment are seeking a name for
It.

Something like “Old Bill,” the
goat mascot of the Navy, or “Ram-
eses ll,” Mr. Ram of the Ford-
ham outﬁt, is an idea of what some
schools call their mascots. The con-
test closes midnight Saturday be-
fore the Penn-State clash in No-
vember, with the prize being two
center section reserved seats for
that game.

It seems that the contest arose
out of some clay modeling done by
the artist, Ole Jochumsen, who
created some very unique ﬁgures
of the Panther. The covers of
Panther ~football programs will
carry a series of these new and
original creations modeled ﬁrst in
clay, and then photoed by Luke,
Swank, University photographer.

Entries for the Panther-naming
contest may be turned in at either
the Pitt News office or to Frank

‘When The Chimes

Sound —-.—

Musical chimes, that remind stu-
dents of their favorite radio pro-
grams, signal the beginning and end-
ing of classes now in the Cathedral.

These chimes are heard through-
out the building from 63 radio loud-
speakers, to which they are relayed
by a public address system. Located
in the purchasing office in the Cathe-
dral, the chimes are automatically op-
erated by the master clock in Thaw
Hall.

At the half-hour when classes end,
eight notes are heard. These are the
same tones played by Westminster
Chimes at the half-hour. At the be-
ginning of each class hour one note
is played.

Lambda Chi Man Becomes
Vice-president; Fifth
Ofﬁcer Ruslander

Alex Willson, C38, Lambda Chi,
is the new vice-president of Inter-

lengthy discussion at a special execu-
tive committee meeting at the Sigma

without title. Though these new
selections are strictly in accordance
with the IF Council constitution, all
chairmanships and committee
appointments for the coming year
will be selected as agreed upon in
the extra-constitutional agreement
made last semester.

Phi Delts First

To circumvent the loss of regis-
tration cards during pre-rushing sea-
son, each fraternity has been allot-
ted one day in which it alone will
have access to the University ﬁles.
The date given each fraternity was
selected by lot. Beginning today, Phi
Delta Theta may obtain its list of
eligible rushees. Tomorrow is Pi
Lambda Phi’s day.

Monday Delta Tau Delta will have
access to the cards, and the rest of
next week permits, Lambda Chi
Alpha, Pi Kappa Alpha, Phi Epsilon
Pi, Kappa Sigma and Sigma Alpha
Mu, in that order, to look through
the ﬁles. Next Monday, October 5,
Theta Chi will have its chance, fol-
lowed by Phi Gamma Delta, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, Phi Kappa, and Sigma
Chi. Sigma Chi will ﬁnish the list on
October 9, just three days before
the rushing season begins.

All the cards are numbered cron-
secutively, and will be checked each
evening after each fraternity has
ﬁnished that day’s selection. This
plan is to prevent a recurrence of
last year’s mishap when many cards
were lost from the dean of men’s
office during this same period.

Cap, Gown Plans
Masquerade Ball

All-School Affair To Mark
Thirtieth Anniversary

 

Undergraduate Cap and Gown Club
is sponsoring an all-University social
affair on Friday, October 30, as part
of its thirtieth anniversary. Tenta-
tive plans call for a masquerade ball,
as beﬁts the season.

Ben Baskin, C37, president of the
club, has already appointed William
Blum, C38, chairman of the dance.
Together with Theodore Bidd1e,. as-
sistant dean of men, they will choose
a committee to work with them.

The positions open are business
manager, publicity manager, and
places on the committee. Petitions

are available at the dean of men’s of- .

ﬁce, Room 801, Cathedral. They
must beireturned by noon Monday.

Applicants must have been con-
nected in some capacity with at least
one Cap and Gown production.

The Cap and Gown is an annual
musical comedy produced by the men
of the University. It wasbegun in
1908 with the show, “In Wupland.”

Dr. J. S. Ashbrook, professor of den- _

tal anatomy and honorary life presi-
dent of the graduate Cap and Gown
Club, was a member of the ﬁrst cast.
The latest show was “Out for the
Count.”

as a Panther football coach.
Originally carded for a usual push-
over starter, the Panther-Bishop game
has turned into something with a dif-
ferent outlook. The Ohio boys will
probably come to Pittsburgh and the
Panther game in the same frame of
mind in which they entered many
other big games. A glance at the record
books shows that the Bishops have
been responsible for many upsets,
including Michigan, Michigan State
and Syracuse, in pastseasons.
Something more important for the
Sutherland squad to think of, however,
is i-ts apparent weakness for the past
three years in the ﬁrst game of the
season. Tie this together with Ohio

’ Wesleyan’s 'pot-shot for a successful

season by licking a major team, and
there may be something there. Last
year the Golden Panthers took a 14-0
game from Waynesburg, and Panther
rooters didn’t celebrate much that
Saturday night. Three years ago the
Pitt boys waited until the ﬁnal quar-
ter to pull the fans out of a cloud of
suspense with a win over Wash-Jeff,
9-0. Panther, rooters sat home with
i Grandma that night also.

Tomorrow, though, is another day,
another year, and contains another
new opponent for the Panthers to paw
over. Reports from the home of the
Bishops in Delaware, Ohio, claim a
total of 13 lettermen who return this
year. Of these, eight will start for
Wesleyan while three are sophomores.

Perhaps the greatest single threat
the Bishop outﬁt offers is Pat Brooks,
a halfback who can throw passes, run,
and do everything that a good little
halfback should do. His passes are the
point of concern for the Panthers to-
morrow.

Up on the Trees practice ﬁeld
Sutherland will wind his team up for
the last time this afternoon so that
they won’t run down on the Stadium
turf tomorrow and make a mess of
things. The starting lineup, as it will
probably lineup tomorrow, contains
most of the pre-season scrimmage
favorites for the positions.

One important change will show Bill
Daddio, sophomore, at the end post in

''Little Man, What Now?"

ND NOW we have Men’s Council? According to reports the

ﬁrst meeting of the year is scheduled for next Tuesday. Per-
haps neither the officers nor lowly councilmen know the “score.”
One thing, however, we do know, and that is that the boys have N.
Robert Seidle, the late benedict, calling signals. From one year
of Interfrat Council maneuvers behind him, he has also learned
how to handle the sticks on the sidelines. He knows that the steel
wire stretched between’ the two poles is virtually inﬂexible. It
stretches very little even at the most vigorous tugs. Bob Seidle
also knows that when the ball is pushed goalward ten yards in the
required number of downs, there is one alternative. That alterna-
tive is to move the sideline sticks correspondingly ahead, and al-
low for more downs. This goes on and on, theoretically, at least,
but before we go into touchdowns, let's shift to the in-between
scene. After all, the game progresses for the most part inside the
white stripes, at least under normal conditions.

It's Not The Custom . . .

On Monday there will actually be only one team on that ﬁeld
unless some of the boys have worked out a few signals of their
own. The stiff ﬁght with the Bishops in nearby Pitt Stadium will
have been forgotten by that time. So will Men’s Council's tough
opener against Men’s Customs be forgotten.

But next Monday the two are scheduled to reach the parting of
the ways. While Pitt gridders prime for the Buckeyes and the
Irish, Men’s Council will be seeking games with Fifth Avenue and
Apollo. Another point, the same Men’s Customs team was last
year defeated by an SFA committee outﬁt that had no long con-
stitution to slow up the charge.

It was not a bad idea to use the double jumping-the-fence wing
back against an opponent that had no opponent one year ago. Men’s
Customs does have a very deﬁnite and important place in the Uni-
versity. But should Men’s Council, much like the Drake Gulls, at-
tempt to compete on the same ﬁeld'as the mowing-machine crew
of the late Knute Rockne some years back? The effect was disas-
trous, if we remember correctly, with the score up in the low
70’s. But this game is on the gridiron, not the fairways.

But back to Men’s Council. Those Irish do strange things, like
making us forget our Drake's, and Fifth Avenue’s.

And Now. Monday . . .

The ball is in play at midﬁeld. It always seems to be just about
there, yet it is hard to ﬁnd. Perhaps they need no ball in this sta-
dium. Yet there is no stadium, and only a few Pledges on the side-
lines indifferently mumbling strange signals. You know it must
be pig latin, but you don’t worry too much for you think perhaps
you may never use more than that wide end run from side-line to
side-line. The ball is still in midﬁeld. Once it moved past the
forty, but this was only to vary that side-line run a bit. Most play-
ers realize that downﬁeld plays are futile, that perhaps this work
should be left for another team of players.

Bob Seidle worked the sticks quite admirably from the sidelines
last campaign. His upperclass counselors stretched over just the
right space of freshmen. It, the ﬁrst venture, we thought, was ad-
mirably well handled, and most successful. But many people must
believe in this “Every girl and boy an office” creed, for lo last
spring, the wheel let loose from the SFA machine and there we
had a happy Jimmy Nicholas, beaming success.

In conclusion, we are back to the “now we have Men’s Council ?”.
Perhaps the question mark is even a bit fatter in the body . . . than
before.

Seminar Groups
To Hear Experts

Indust-rial, Technical Heads
Will Feature Meetings

Industrial and technical leaders in
the business world will give engineers
new ideas on work in their lines at
weekly seminars for engineering stu-
dents, to be conducted every Thurs-
day. First meetings of the engineer-
ing groups were held yesterday.

Among experts already lined up as
speakers for the mechanical and
aeronautical engineering seminars is
R. J. S. Piggott, head of the engi-
neering division of the Gulf Research
and Development corporation. Mr.
Piggott is nationally known for his
work in devising instruments for 10-
cating oil deposits, and is a nominee
for vice-president of the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers.

Other specialists who will be fea-
ture speakers at seminars are Mr.
William Butler, president of the Rust
Engineering Corporation, and Mr. J.

Newman Smoker,

Party Will Open
Club’s Activities

A men’s smoker, to be held Thurs-
day, September 29, at 8:30 o’clock in
Cathedral High Gym, will inaugurate
the season’s many activities spon-
sored by the Newman Club, a social
and religious organization of Catho-
lic students from the various Pitts-
burgh universities.

On Thursday, October 1, at 8:00
o’clock, the Women's group will hold
a “get-acquainted party” at the same
location.

The purpose of the Club, its social
and religious program, will be set
forth at these meetings, and old and
new students may make the ac-
quaintance of the Rev. Vincent F.
Burke, resident priest at St. Paul’s
Cathedral and newly appointed
Chaplain. All university students at-
tending the affairs will be invited to
join. Lew Bale, E37, director of
Freshman Camp, will act as toast-
master.

Institute Staff To Move

The Mellon Institute staff will
move into its new quarters on Fifth
Avenue and Belleﬁeld St. in the lat-
ter part of November, according to
present plans.

An Aspirin, Smigginsl
Panther Prowls Again!

Even a woman editor has the
right to change her mind, and Miss
Irene Matveak, C37, editor of the
Panther, proved this Wednesday
when her Panther failed to show
on the campus Wednesday as
scheduled.

Maybe it was because it was Miss
Irene’s birthday and the printer re-
fused to allow her to bring out a
Panther until she became of age.
Maybe it was because the printer
didn't have the Panther magazine
all set to go. We'll leave it go at
that anyway.

Regardless of the Wednesday
affair, the Panther is on sale today,
and if the student has the sales re-
sistance to refuse to buy a copy
from those persistent salesmen, we
believe Jock Sutherland could use
him to help his varsity resist Ohio
State, Notre Dame, and a few
others.

Future Plans Made

A new typewriting book has been
written by D. D. Lessenberry, asso-
ciate professor of commercial edu-
cation. The text, “Twentieth Cen-
tury Typewriting for College,” was
released from the press last week. It
is a revision of a text-book published
ﬁve years ago.

Mr. Lessenberry also announces
that a new method of shorthand, the
functional method, is being taught
this semester. The technique used
is a direct method of teaching lan-
guages. Emphasis is on mastery of
reading the vocabulary before the
writing is done.

Ohio Wesleyan Bishops Meet Panthers In Initial Game
Of Sutherland’s Thirteenth Season As Golden
Cat Head Football Coach

(Continued from Page 1)
Paul “Bomber” Shaw’s place. Shaw has not rounded into condition. At another
key position, center, in all probability will be Don Hensley, junior-letterman,
who was locked all even with Henry Adams for quite some time in the scram-

ble for the start.

Johnny Michelosen will probably start over Arnold Greene, who has come
up fast the last week of practice. Mike was the regular last season but
Greene, if he keeps up his present pace, will see action from elsewhere than

the bench this year. In weight, Greener

holds the advantage over Michelosen
with a 210 to 187-pound count.

At halfback will be the only other
sophomore, in addition to Daddio, in
the person of Marshall “Biggie” Gold-
berg, one of the most promising sec-
ond-year men to come up in recent
years. All that “Biggie” has done has
been to give off sensational exhibits in
both the spring and pre-season prac-
tice drills to earn his job. Weighing
175 pounds, Goldberg will be given his
ﬁrst chance in “big-time” tomorrow to
strut his stuff.

The remainder of the Panther start-
ers are all varsity men who received
plenty of experience from last sea-
son’s games. Frank Souchak, junior,

will team up with_Daddio on theends. _ , '-

‘~.‘Chow,” a heavy boy of 192 pounds,
is fast, aggressive, and a good pass
receiver. Ohio Wesleyan’s safety men
would be much safer in making free
catches here. - - -
« At the tackles are two of the
tougher Panther players, George De-
lich and Tony Matisi. Both boys have
the weight, experience, ' »-and ability.
Delich comes in at 192 pounds while
Matisi shoves the scales up to the 210-
pound mark.

Glassford Aggressive

 Showing the same characteristics
are the two guards, Biff Glassford-and

Dante Dalle Tezze, which rather leaves . .

the Panther line without much of a

loophole. Glassford is one of th'e_;_rnain-.
stays of the Pitt team. A senio?r;‘he»'

is a. two year letterman, aggressive, a
good blocker, and a great ﬁeld leader.
Dalle Tezze holds a year of experi-

ence and is a hardiiman to put~'out of 1.

any play. Both Glassford and Dalle
Tezze weigh 190 pounds.
3 Now back to the backﬁeld and the
two stars of last year that were omit-
ted, Bobby LaRue and Frank Patrick.
LaRue ‘is the running mate to Gold-
berg at the halfback position‘. He is
the lightest man on the team at 163
pounds and has the drive and speed
necessary for a good halfback. Bobby
can always be counted on for plenty
of yardage.
' Patrick, a possible starter at the
fullback post, comes from that full-
back family of the triple-threat spe-
cies. Frank can run, kick, and pass
and do all of them efficiently. Last
year, he was up among the leaders in
the scoring column of Eastern elevens.
Pat is an improved blocker and ball-
carrier over the 1935 season which
makes him even more valuable. He is
exceptionally good on the defense.
Put all these together and the 1936
Panther football team is all set on
paper for the opener tomorrow. Ac-
cording to sports writers from around
the country, the Panthers are due for
a good season. They have the material
and the power to plough through their
nine-game schedule. How well they
begin will be known tomorrow after-
noon a little after ﬁve o’clock. If they
get past Ohio Wesleyan, then they
have the happy thought that only
West Virginia, Ohio State, Duquesne,
Notre Dame, Fordham, Penn State,
Nebraska, and Carnegie Tech remain.

Pitt-Fins To Offer
Two Fins As Bait

Aquatic Club Will Sponsor
Contest For Scenario

 

 

With a ten dollar prize as bait,
the Pitt-Fins Club of WAA is cast-
ing its ﬁrst line to the woman who
submits the scenario best adapted for
a water pageant on or before mi-d-
night, Saturday, October 17.

The contest is open to any woman,
non-swimmer or swimmer, who is
registered at the University.

There are no hooks or strings at-
tached, but the following points will
be considered in judging: suitability
for production in a swimming pool;
opportunity presented for demonstra-
tion of swimming'and diving skill;
simplicity of costuming, lighting and
scenery; length of time required for
performance—1 to 2 hours; authen-
tic use of history or legend, particu-
larly of the Pittsburgh region; and
use of music.

Manuscripts should be submitted
to Eleanor Fedigan, Ed37, 6433
Monitor Street. '

Co-Tennis Champs

Because of the lack of a net in
the Stadium, Carl Kaufman, C40,
and Bob Burns, C40, share hon-ors as
tennis champs of Freshman Camp.
The playoff scheduled for last Mon-
day was called off with both ﬁnalists
content that the College score a com-
plete sweep in the athletic events on
the Camp card.

The College scored triumphs in
mushball and volley ball, and aided
Milt Lederstein, IKS and Fifth Ave-
nue swim champ, clinch the swim
meet. .

Strong 1936 Pitt

Of Scott High Athletes;

By LEONARD LITMAN
Nation Watching Pitt

Tomorrow the gridiron spotlight
will be focused on the Pitt Stadium.
Football coaches and experts all over
the country are waiting anxiously to
see what Jock Sutherland has devel-
oped from his promising crew of last
year. The coaches are holding their
tongues in the corner of their mouths
in bitter anticipation of another
Sutherland juggernaut that is ex-
pected to roll merrily on this year to
leave nine hapless opponents in its
wake. (Ten——counting the Rose

Bowl game.)

The experts are leaﬁng through
their frayed dictionaries to ﬁnd words
to describe another Pitt wonder team
as they prepare a ch-orus of cheers
to proclaim the Panther’s return to
the nation’s football throne. Ohio
Wesleyan will send to Pittsburgh an
ideal team for an opening day game
as the Battling Bishops are just rug-
ged enough to test the Pitt strength
and put the Panther ,machine into
gear f-or the very important journey
ahead.

Goldberg Shows Promise

The old-timers are happy again.
In happy retrospect, they are al-
lowing their minds to wander
back to the days of Tom Davies
and up through the years that gave
us Gibby Welch, Jimmy Hagan,
Toby Uansa, and Warren Heller to
see the ghosts of these gridiron
greats stalking the Panther prey
again as they gaze upon young
Marshall Goldberg, the dynamo
from West Virginia's forest coun-
try.

Never have the glasses of
at -unch Pitt supporters turned to
such a roseate hue in viewing the
prospects of a sophomore athlete.

by Pitt men that only superlative
adjectives could ever describe.

Scott High Again

Pitt has another debt to repay
Scott High School, of North Brad-
dock. Scott had only two men in
Pitt athletics last year and both were
captains of their sports, winners of
the Wettach awards, and leaders in
their classroom as a glance at the
records of Ted Roderick and Nick
Kliskey will attest.

The newest contribution from this
school that has not been beaten on
the football ﬁeld during their last
thirty-eight games is Elmer Merkov-
sky, the giant sophomore tackle who
is giving the veterans from last year
a merry battle for their first team
berth. Merkey was one of the out-
standing stars in the recent practice

the squad.

General Chatter

North Carolina is all a-twitter
over the Pitt-Duke game in 1937.

. . The Blue Devils are coming
along fast since Wallace Wade
took things over and will be just
about ready for Pitt next year .
A prominent Dixie coach was
quoted as saying, “No wonder Pitt
wins, they get ﬁrst call on the boys
right around Pittsburgh. Give me
a team of boys from Western Penn-
sylvania and l’ll clean up anything
they have down here!" . . . Just
like criticizing Cecil Rhodes for
picking up the diamonds that were
lying all around him.

Housing Course Given

A new course in housing is now
being offered by the department of
social work. This course is given by
Mr. Joseph Tufts, head of the Pitts-
burgh Housing Association. Mr.
Tufts is also active in the National
Association program. He was for-

Plans For Music,
Forensic Contests

 

Seven Committee Members
Picked To Issue Rules
For Tenth Season

Plans are being made for the tenth
season of statewide contests in music
and speech activities for the high
schools of Pennsylvania by C. Stan-
ton Belfour, assistant director of the
Extension Division of the University,
and executive secretary of the P-enn-
sylvania Forensic League.

The committee for the selection of
the test pieces for the forty-seven
music events in the contest is already
at work, and intends issuing the 1937
edition of the rules and regulations
early next month.

The members comprising this com-
mittee are: Dr. Will Earhart, direc-
tor of m-usic in Pittsburgh public
schools; Richard Grant, director of
music at Pennsylvania State College;
Huldah Kenley and Susan Canﬁeld,
department of music, Carnegie Insti-
tute of Technology; Lee M. Lock-
hart, director of the University band
and orchestra; Oscar Demmler, Fifth
Avenue high school; Hummel Fish-
burn, professor of music, Pennsyl-
Vania State College; and Dr. Charles
Boyd, director of the Pittsburgh
Musical Institute.

The material for the speech ac-
tivities, which makes up the other
half of these contests is being pre-
pared by Theresa Kahn and Charles
Lomas, instructors in English.

These contests have proven great
successes in past years, according to
Mr. Belfour. They are conducted
principally to stimulate music and
speech activities by competitive tests
and to recognize talents in the vari-
ous ﬁelds.

The ﬁnals for this 10th annual
state contest will be held next year
in Altoona.

Who Said?
‘Cock Robin Is Dead’

Phillip Barry’s “Cock Robin,” long
delayed production of the Pitt Play-
ers, will be staged at last on October
21 and 22.

Twice killed last year, first by the
ﬂood, and later by the indisposition
of its leading man, Ellis Tumpson,
BA36, this year's performance gives
promise of being successfully com-
pleted. Tumpson was to have had his
ﬁrst major lead of his career.

Following the opener, Carl Cass,
director of the Players, has scheduled
three additional plays for the year.

“The First Mrs. Fraser,” by St. John ,

Irvine, is to be given on November
23-24; “Square Peg,” by Louis Beach,

Lanfear Explains
Orientation Aims

Freshman Course Stresses
Personality Development

The aim of this year's college ori-
entation classes is to help freshmen
make the break from high school to
college with as few mistakes as pos-
sible, asserted Dr. Vincent W. Lan-
fear, dean of men, in an interview
yesterday.

“Education should be concerned
with the development of personality
as well as the development of the
mind and the course is planned to
do both,” he stated.

This year's course covers the his-
tory and the background of the Uni-
versity, the objectives and meanings
of education, the value and danger
of activities, how to study, how to
take notes, personality and its devel-
opment, the use of the library, health
and mental hygiene, and choosing a
vacation.

Members of the faculty who are
leaders of the classes include Dr.
Lanfear, Theodore Biddle and Robert
Seidle, assistant deans of men; Dr.
Charles S. Tippetts, dean of the
school of business administration;
J. C. Barton, head of the Placement
Bureau; Dr. H. C. Carlson, head of
the Student Health Service; Dr. Ken-
dall Tesh, head of the Johnstown cen-
ter; Dr. Omar C. Held, assistant
