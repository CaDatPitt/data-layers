Former Pitt Chancellor

Dr. Edward Litchﬁeld, former University chancellor, died Friday night when the plane

their search by the over-hanging fog. ,

in Chicago, to ﬂy on to a birthday reunion in Topeka, Kas. Mrs. Litchﬁeld, the former chancel-
lor’=s «second wife, is a native of Hiawatha, Kas., and had worked for the State Department and
Internation-al Co-operation Administration in Washington. P

sion and emerged with, another

PAUL MOYER
Will deliver Keynote Address

Litchﬁeld, University chancel-
lor from 1955 to 1965, was the
son of a Detroit postal official,
graduated from the University
of Michigan and shortly after-.
ward was defeated in a. cam-
paign for the state senate.

Four years later, he com-
pleted his doctorate in political
science and became an instruc-
tor at Brown University. Five
years after this, General Lucius
Clay called him to Germany to
help re-establish political unity.
General Clay praised Dr.Litch-
ﬁeld for his work there. Litch-
ﬁeld later attended conferences
of the Council of Foreign Min-
isters in Moscow and London.
He also served a-s consultant to
the Secretary of the Army and
taught at the University of Mich-
igan and at Cornell University
before -becoming chanchellor.

As chancellor, he began a vi-
sionary program of growth for
the University, but the ambiti-
ous program ran the University
into near-bankruipty. Litchﬁeld
resigned under pressure in July,
1965.

Langley,
Halls were constructed while he
was chancellor. The Schenley
Hotel was acquired and plans
for the Hillm-an Library were
drawn up during -his adminis-
tration. , ‘

Since then Litchﬁeld, 53 years
old, has lived on a 600-acre
farm named Tumble Run in Pot-
ter Oounty, near Coudersport,
Pa. Last December, US Senator
Joseph S. Clark named Ditch-
field his campaign chairman in
his drive for re-election. Clark
has said since the accident that
his personal «grief in the loss of
such a close ﬁriend by far out-
weight-s any campaign disap-
pointment he may meet.

‘The Tempest’ Conjures Mystery

by HOBART HARRIS
The University's newest pro-
duct:ion, The Tempest, is a com-
edy. You’re supposed to walk
in, find your seat, -sit down and
enjoy yourself. Since the Temp-

_ est is a Shakespearean comedy,

you are also supposed to under
stand the dialogue, watch while
the actors conjure up a proper
air of mystery and romance and
be convinced, no matter how
fast he skitters and jumps
around the stairs, Ariel isn’t go-
ing to fall off a step -and break
his neck.

The most striking part of the
University of Pittsburgh The-
atre’s (UPI) production was
the quality of the acting. The
play is particularly full of short,
one liners when one of the char-
acters suddenly realizes that he
has the other one -on t-he ropes,
or Vice versa. The temptation
to overact must be great, but

the actors seemed to have had.

an instinctive knowledge of how
far to go and how far to let the
absurdity of the situation brood
in the a-udlience’Is mind without

embellishment.

The actor most deserving of
praise was John Krich, who
played Prospero, the former
Duke of Milan whose throne
had been usurped by his broth-
er, Antonio. Krich plays the part
with the semi-comic assurance
that -presents Prospero as the
good father that hevwas. and
the good Duke that he on-ce had
been. Never faltering, Krich
leads the play right down to the
ﬁnal lsoliloquy Where the Duke
calls for the audience’s a.pplause,
with just the right mixture of
triumph and happiness so that
the triumph of the Duke over
his enemies, and the actor over
his part intermin-gle, and the
audience realizes that there are
two men speaking through the
voice of one. Karich was that
good.

Daniel Nalbach handled the
part of Caliban with equal skill.
Showing the reﬂection that
must have gone into preparing
for the part, Nalbach was able
to extract both the horror and
the humor within Caliban’s soul,
one moment plotting against
P1-ospero’s life, the next scurry-
ing across the stage, sure that
Prospero has sent snakes and
crabs after him to punish him
for his treachery. C ’

Gregory Lehane, as Ariel, was
also excel-lent, spending his t:ime
leapinig around the stage with
complete assurance. And the
stage, props, and costumes were
also good, doing much to set
the mood.

Page 4 — THE PIT!‘ NEWS — Monday, March 11, 1968,

WE sA1f spellbound in Car-
negiie Music Ha-ll September 8,
1964, our eyes fastened t-o the
man‘ towering over the speak-
er’-s rostrum in ﬂowing, purple
robes. The gold seal of the Chan-
cellor dangling from his neck
shone as he proclaimed us the
“langest, brightest, geographic-
ally -farthest- ﬂung freshman
class” in the University's his-
tory.

He told us" that this was a
“time of greatness for your in-
stitution/,’ and transformed us
from a group of high school
graduates i-nto active partici-

‘ pants in the University's road

to excellence. We felt that we
were contniibutors, when in ac-
tusality Dr. Edward H. Litch-
ﬁeld was almost -singularly re-
sponsible for putting Pitt on the
academic map.

For the University that fall
of 1964 was a school with one
goal in mind-to become the ﬁn-
est -urban University in the
country. The _,concepts of state-
relatedness and regionalism
were never even discussed.
'I'-h-ere was no doubt in our
minds four years ago that our
lSClh0O1 would remain a private
un:iversity—one »_on the road to
greatness.

WHEN WE left the Music
Hall our first day of school, we
knew why we came to Pitt.

‘What fnreshman orientation, bro-

chures and heresay had failed
t-o give u.s, Chancellor lliitchﬁ-eld
now provided — an allegiiance

S to the University of Pittsburgh. ’

«His past achievements had at-

tracted many of us here and_

the speech he delivered and im-
pression he created that warm
September day told us that his
grand design for excellence.
would not be redrawn.

-He stood above us in his gran-
deur, yet there was a kinship
between him and the lowluiest
freshma-n; he”wou-ld guide us
and we would follow him in
making the University of Pitts-
burgh synonymous with only

' th-e ﬁn-est. We placed him on a

pedestal we -believed he rightly
deserved, never expecting to
have everything s—h-attered less
than one year later when he re-
signd under ﬁre following the
announcement of our staggering
$1"-9.5 millsi-on debt.

HE WAS part of our educa-

tion at Pitt for one school year,
and when he left, we were in a
ﬁnancial crisis, yet to us his
only crime was that he had
grand dreams—and he told how
those who had promised to
match those dreams with the
money to ﬁnance them had let
him down. If this were the

cllities that were to be con-
structed by 1967. State-rel'ated-
ness was not even in our vocab-
ulary three years ago; now its
restrictions and implications
dominate the entire education-
al scene at this University.

Chanchellor Litchﬁeld was re-
placed by state-relatedness, a
supposed cure-a.ll to our prob-
lems. But you can’t replace the
dynamism of a Litchﬁeld with
the stagnation of a State Legis-
lature. Visions of greatness be-
come secondary when there's a
constant worry as -to whether
or not Pitt will even meet its
operating expenses.

Litchﬁeld’s last class will be

his visions of greatness for Pitt.
His death is a personal tragedy
to us, for though we may only
have said an occasional “hello’.’
to him, he was an integral part
of our education at Pitt, not
just for the one year he was
our Chancellor, but for the tone
he set that guided us through-

This is a moment of deep

grief for the University of?

Pittsburgh. Edward Litchﬁeld

is gone, and his vitality, in-

telligence, and creativity will
be missed by all who knew
him or have been affected by

-him in this institution.
While we mo-urn his loss,

we know that he has earned

a secure place as one of the

outstanding American educa-

tors of this generation, as
well as one _of the most pro-

ductivc leaders in the 180

year history of the Univer-

sity.

Under his guidance, the Uni-
vcrsitd made giant strides -in
education. We beneﬁt from
and will build upon the aca-
demic values that he created
here. These include a student
body of high ability and with a
thirst for scholarly challenge,
a faculty whose strong pres-
tige is exceeded only by its
competence for teaching and
research, and a pervasive in-
stitutional style of innova-
tion.

All members of the Univer-
sity community owe him
gratitude for these achieve-
ments. I, personally, have the
obligation not only to pre-
serve them, but to advance
them. For the basic character
of this University, so capably
enhanced by Edward Litch-
ﬁeld, is forward momentum.

Navy Sails To Easy Eastern Mat

2 Surprising Panthers Grab
Fifth Place In Team Battle

-W "u i ~‘1i..‘-(Q-."\‘ 7--

In Reversal of Last Year p

by MIKE BROURMAN
Assistant Sports Editor

As the bandplayed “Anchors Aweigh” for the sev-
enth time, little Ed Peery, Navy coach and former Panther
123 pound national champion, grinned broadly and accept-

1_ 2 ed atrophy -nearly as large as he.

. Amidst a tournament replete. with upsets, Peery"s Middies had
sailed to their first Eastern wrestling title in 22 years, by a comfort-

able mangin over runn-erup Penn
State.
But, «if rPeery was the hap-

piest man in the Field House,.
4 he was only s-lightly more con-
tent than Dave Adams. Not only .

had A-dams s-een some of the
wrestlers he recruited while as-

si-sting Peery at Navy aid the _

Middiie triumph. But, he Saw
the Panthens accomlp-li-sh the
most remarkable reversal in -the

? entire tournament.

After a humiliating 15th place
ﬁnish a year ago, when they

M scored minus two points, the

‘ matmen piled up 28 points this
time to ﬁnish a strong ﬁfth.

I I -And three wrestlers, Bruce Un-

angst, Ron Schuchert, and Ter-

Unangst’s

IyUpsct Bid ,
Falls Short

-Practically everybody at

[the Field House Saturday

A night, outside of Navy coach
Ed Peery, the Navy team, and
a few -others, was behind Bruce

“ Unlangst when he went out on

the mat to meet Navy's Gary
Burger for the.EIWA 123 pound
-title.

Both had fairly easy rides int-o

. l_ the title bout. Burger scored
‘-  two falls, then defeated Lehigh’s

Rich Meyer, 7-4, in the sem.i-ﬂ-
nals. U-nanngst had taken 13-1
and 14-3 decisions before out-
lasting Wayne Boyd of Temple,
_4-2.

 There they were—Un'an»gst,

. Pitt's undefeated sophomore, and

Burger, _.a two-time Easterns
runner-urp. The crowd, largely
Lehigh, was wa-itirug .to see what

j_ ‘ Bruice could’ do.
 , ~ . What Bruce did was take Bur-

ger down after only 30 seconds.
But Burger fought back and es-

"camped after a minute. He es-
 again at the start of the
second period to tie the match, p

2-2.

-In the last 5:16 neither wrest-
ler scored on any type of offen-
‘sive or defensive move. ‘Burger
picked up one point for riding
time, and one point for Unangst
stalling to win a 4-2 decision,
unpopular with the crowd.

Afterwards, Unangst called
the match “the biggest letdown
of -the evening. He's real tough
and he’ll probably win the na-

I ttionals.

He added, though, “Tonight
the was better than me. If I
wrestled him tomorrow, it might
be a. different story.” 6

Burger seemed very impress-

I I ed with Unangst.

“He’s the best man on his
feet I met all year,” he remark-
. ed. “He's the -only ‘fellow I met
W all year that I co-uldn’t take
down. He's better than I am on
his feet. I was lucky on that one
can't!

 

ry Hoover captured places in
the championships.

Unangst made it all the way
to the 123 pound ﬁnals before
bowing, 4-2, to Navy's Gary Bur-
ger. Hoover ﬁnished third at
heavyweight, an-d S-chuc’hert
pl-a»ced fourth at 137.

“We're pleased with what we
did,” said Adams. “Those guys
wrestled their hearts out.”

After two easy wins, Hoover
met Penn’s top-seeded Mike Haj-
jarlin the semi-ﬁnals. Terry con-
ceded his opponent‘50 pounds,
but still only lost, 7-4. “If I
weighed 35 more pounds, I could
have beaten him,” Hoover said.
“As far as wrestling -skills go, I
had the kid beat.”

Schuchert advanced to the
semi-ﬁnals where he met Frank-
l-in & Marshall's second-seed-ed
Jake H-om-iak. Despite the fact
that he was not taken down,
Schuchert lost, 4-1, when Homi-
ak scored a near fall in the sec-
ond period and an escape in the
third.

In the consolation match, Schu-

key, 2-0, at the start of the .sec-
ond period. As Comiskey ‘moved
to escape, Schuchert injured his
leg and, after a short resump-
tion, was forced to default.

It was only one of the bad‘
breaks -suffered by the Pan-
thers, but there were also a cou-
ple of unexpected victories.

Jim Rhone, whom Adams had
predicted could score a couple
upsets, won twice for two points.
Randy Kahler picked up a point
in the consolation bracket at
177, and Paul Allen scored two
points by pinning Lehighis Ron
Ries.

The Allen-Rlies ‘match was one
of the tournament's most excit-
ing. Paul had defeated Ries in
the dual meet, for his only win
of the regular season. Ries

with a 4-1 lead, when Allen es-
caped, scored a takedown, and
pinned Ries. The Lehigh wrest-
ler left the ﬂoor with tears in
his eyes and told coach Gerry
Leeman, “He's got my number,
coach.

Leeman was also involved in‘

the most controversial decision
of the meet, when the 4-3 vic-
tory of Lehigh’s Jack Bentz at
167 was disallowed because of
an improper ruling by the ref-
eree.

It was a courageous decision
by the meet officials, especially
in the face of a predominantly
Lehigh crowd, but when a three
minute wrestle-off between Bentz
and Yal-e’s Tom Mt-Ewan ended
scoreless, three judges award-
ed Bentz the title.

BRUCE UNANGST, undefeated in 12 matches this year, lost his first
in a 4-2 decision to Navy's Gary Burger in the finals of the 123 class.

The judges-’ decision was well
received by the crowd, but it
‘ did raise a few eyebrows.

Aside from that moment, and
a crowd-pleasing win by Navy's
Mark Kane over Hajjar in the
heavyweight ﬁnals, there were
few close matches. _

Besides Bu-rger, top-seed vic-
tors included Penn State's Wal-
1y Clark at 130, Dave Spinda at
137, Navy's defending champion
Pete Vandenlofske at 145, F&M’s
Jim Clair «at 152-, and State's

Lorenzo won all four matches
by pins, thus capturing the
Sheridan trophy for most pins.
He was also named Outstanding

Lane, 800 Relay Place In Swim

by ART ROSENGARTEN

The swim story this season was one of strong
personal performances by a few mermen. The story
ended that way this past weekend as those few
competed in the Eastern championships at Prince-
ton University. . s

“The boys were just terrific,” said head coach
Bill Grant, referring to the performances of John
Lane, Chris Price, and Howard and Richard Norris.
“They had nothing to be asha.med of the way they
swam.”

In a meet completely dominated by a Yale team,
minus Olympian Don Schollander, the swimmers
were only able to placein the consolation finals
twice.

Senior John Lane, in his last competitive meet
for the swimmers, placed tenth out of 32 swimmers
in the 400-yard individual medley and anchored
the 800-yard freestyle relay team to a fifth place
finish in the consolations.

V“This was one of John's top performances,”
praised Grant. “He was really ready for this one

\(

and he certainly showed it.” Lane swam his fast-
est time for the 200-yard freestyle while anchoring
the relay and clipped ﬁve seconds o-ff his best time
in the individual medley.

Lane’s individual medley time and the time of
the 800 relay were both new Pitt marks.

Co-captain Chris Price was nipped tw.ice in his
bid to reach the consolation finals. He finished in
13th place in both the 200-yard breastroke and the
200-yard individual medley.‘ Twelfth place is the
last qualifying spot for the consolation finals.

Both Norris twins were shut o-ut in their quest
for the finals, but their performances showed
Grant a great deal. “Howard swam a real good
200 butterﬂy, while Richard looked extremely
sharp on all three days of competition,” he said.
“I‘m certain that the story for them will be differ-
ent next year.” I

With his first Eastems behind him, Grant looks
forward to better things. And as one coach told
him, “The way your boys performed, it looks like
we will be hearing from Pitt very soon.”

  Holly Finishes Seventh  

Fr-osh Team Second to Villanova

Holly did a 1:12.8 in ﬁnishing
second to Villanov-a’s Larry
James in his preliminary heat,
and then did a 1212.9 in the ﬁ-

Two weeks ago, the freshman
medley relay team ran a 7140.1
in C‘al3’tUI“ing the Delaware In-
vitational title. Saturday night
they co-uld manage only a 7:576
in ﬁnishing second to Villanova
at the IC4A’s at the new Mada-
son Square Garden. 6

“We got in the hole early,” ex-
plained coach Jim Banner. “We
were way behind afte-r the first
two legs. We just couldn't catch
up. Then Jerry (Richey) got us
up to second, but ﬁrst was out
ah-ead so far that all we could
do was protect second place."

VillanoV.a’s winning time of
7247.3 was slow also, but the
Garden track was responsible
for that, according to Banner,
“The track is real slow,” he
commented. “None of the times
were up to par. The surface has
a lot to do with that, and then
the turns are real sharp. It cre-
ates a lot of problems.”

The medley relay consists of
two quartermile legs, one half
mile, and a mile. Smitty Brown
ran a 51.2 quarter, almost two
seconds off his frosh record,
while Wally :Swiger clocked a
52.2, also slower than his best
efforts. -

Neither Rudy Hufnaigl, who
ran the half, nor miler Richey
were up to their best times ei-
th-er. Hufnagl ran a 2:0O.5 half

mile, and Richey ﬁnshed with a
4:12 mile.

The long lead that Villanova
compiled in the first three legs
robbed Richey of a chance at a
rematch with Vilanova miller
Marty Lacouri. Lacouri had
edged the frosh star in the IC4A
cro-ss-country championships last
fall.

But, Richey may get one more
shot at Lacouri during the in-
door season. Banner may enter
him in the exhibition mile at
this week's NCAA champion-
ships in Detroit, and Lacouri
may also be entered. “I won’t
know if I’ll enter him until later
this week,” said Banner.

The other Panther entry in
the IC4A’s, Roger Holly, made
the ﬁnals in the 600 yard run,
and eventually ﬁnished seventh.

GOLFERS MEET TOMORROW

The golf team had a 6-8 record last year and would
have broken even except for two rained out matches.

Golf coach Rex Peery announces that all varsity and
and freshman Golfers are required to meet in Room
130 of Trees Hall tomorrow afternoon.

It you don't agree that
business destroys individuality,
maybe it's because you"rr:+ an
individual.

There’s certain campus talk that claims
individuality is dead in the business world.
That big business is a big brother destroy-
ing initiative.

But freedom of thought and action, when
backed with reason and conviction’s cour-
age, will keep and nurture individuality
whatever the scene: in the arts, the sciences,
and in business.

Scoffers to the contrary, the red corpus-
cles of individuality pay off. No mistake.

Encouraging individuality rather than
suppressing it is policy in a business like
Western Electric-—where we make and pro-

vide things Bell telephone companios need.
Because communications are changing fast,
these needs are great and diverse.

Being involved with a system that helps
keep people in touch, lets doctors send car-
diograms across country for quick analysis,
helps transmit news instantly, is demand-
ing. Demanding of individuals.

If your ambition is strong and your abili-
ties commensurate, you’ll never be truly
happy with the status quo. You’ll seek
ways to change it and—wonderful feeling!-—
some of them will work.

Could be at Western Electric.

“Want a company
where you can really
put your education

to work? See IBM
January 17th or 18t I’ ,

“Some of the engineers who graduated before me
complained that their education didn't mean much
in their jobs. That's not what I wanted," says IBM's
Jim Carr. (Jim is a Manager of Mechanical Process
Engineering. )
“At IBM I knew I'd be using what I learned. There's so

much diversity here that you can usually work in the speciﬁc
area you choose. In my own case, I majored in Mechanical
Engineering and minored in Metallurgy. Today my ME degree
means more than ever. And I often use my metallurgical
background. For example, I'm now working on a process
development program that requires a knowledge of machine
design, metallurgy, heat transfer, and chemistry, all of which

I studied in school.

“Another good thing about IBM's diversity is that it

creates an interdisciplinary environment. You got a chance

to work with and learn from people in many different ﬁelds.
Since our industry is growing so fast, the people you talk to

are likely to be working at state-of—the—art levels or beyond.”

There's a lot more to the IBM story than Jim has mentioned.
