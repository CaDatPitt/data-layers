TRAVEL TALK! .

Belfour F urnishes Statistics
On Extension Division

 

   

According’ to C. Stanton Belfour,
assistant director of the Extension
Division, University faculty members
who have taught extension courses
have traveled 85,000 miles during the
past nine years.

Among the ﬁrst schools to adopt
the ‘idea of extension divisions in the
East, the University-" maintains two
permanent centers in Johnstown and
Erie, and offers courses in 26 other
communities in Western Pennsyl-
vania. In one extension school, 3,458
credits have been earned, equivalent
to -more than 100 master-—degrees. and
if ’.the students from this center had
journeyed to the campus forthese
credits, they would have traveled
over 1,700,000 miles.

Most of the courses offered by the
Extension Division are graduate
courses, and many are designed for
school teachers.

Mr. Belfour also states that the
University believes that it should‘
make such courses possible for alumni
and others in order to "improve the
quality of ‘teaching in Western Penn-
sylvania. “It is a fact,” he says. “that
because of courses ‘offered in this
manner, secondary school teachers in
Western Pennsylvania are better pre-
pared than in many other sections of
the country." ‘

Reaches All Papers

During the past two months.
University news has been sand-

sity history and activities were dis-
tributed by the bureau to all types
of publications throughout the

land.

Instructor In Retail Training
' Emphasizes Fashion’s
Inﬂuence On Men

By Sue Donyni _
“Whether they will admit it or not,
men do follow the fashions.”

This is the statement of one of the
country’s front rank fashion authori-
ties, Miss Bernice Gertrude Cham-
bers, new instructor in the Univer-
sity’s Bureau of Retail Training.

“Men like to scoff at the inﬂuence
of styles,” Miss Chambers points out,
‘_‘but they will wear a certain kind
of suit, necktie, "or underwear be-
cause it is'fas'hionable.”

In discussing‘ modern styles for
both men and women, Miss Chambers
went on to say that our clothes now
are showing a romantic trend, a re-
sult of the inﬂuence of the Duke of
Windsor and Mrs. Simpson as a con-
versation topic.

Streamlining Sets Fashions

Dame Fashion holds absolute rule
over "more than clothes, according to
Miss Cliambc-rs. Fashion trends in lit-
erature at present imlicrrtc Llmt l1is-
torical books are most popular, “Gone
With the Wind” being a good exam-
ple. Streamlined trolley cars, which
are appearing in Pittsburgh more
frequently every day, are another ex-
ample of the demands of fashion.

“The averagespeed of city traﬂic
is only eight miles a.n hour,” declares
Miss C h a m b e r s. “Streamlining
doesn't speed up trolleys at all, but
because streamling is fashionable, we
apply it everywhere possible.”

When asked about the dirt-and-
smoke talk in the Pittsburgh district,
Miss Chambers promptly responded
with the statement that New York
was far dirtier than Pittsburgh, but
New Yorkers never mention dirt in
speaking of their city.

“Applied Chemistry and the World’s
History.”

Dr. Auleene M. Jamison, director

has this to say about the former
senior queen: “I cannot think of Ruth
without feeling a. well as seeing her
lovely smile—--a smile which revealed
her sweet-i1e.~:s, lier friendliness, her
true nobility of character. Somehow,
one could not feel lonely, or sad, or

BritishpP-arc-ifist Warns .

Against Foreign Wars

Cambridge Student‘ Leader

Legislation In._T,a1_k_,Before Combined Luncheon

Urges Stronger" "Neutrality

Meeting Of YM-YW Clubs, Peace Council

. By John Martinncoﬁ
Warning that the United States “will be doing nobody any
good” by going into a foreign war, R. L. Miall, British student
leader, Wednesday presented the ‘Emergency Peace Cam-
paign’s case for neutrality in a campus address.

Speaking at a combined

luncheon meeting of the Pitt

Peace Council and the YM-YWCA<‘z;

upperclass club, Miall declared, “For
goodness sake, keep the United States
out of war. If there will be another
war, nobody will win. The United
States must be kept as one place
where sanity may prevail.”

Miall commented on the fact that

the people of both America and Eng-
land are for peace. “But what par-
ticular virtue is there,” he declared,
“in being all for peace when to-
gether we own one-third of the
world? What good is our talking
peace, peace, peace, and not think-
ing of social justice? ~ Most of. the
smaller countries are for war because
it is an economic necessity. If you
are going to have peace, you must
make sacriﬁces.” ‘
' War, he stated, is brought about
not only by munitions make1's and
ﬁnanciers, but is caused mainly by
ordinary conduct of trade. As a re-
sult, he said, agitation for stronger
neutrality legislation is necessary.

All over the world, he reported,
young people are 11ot willing to ﬁght
in their country’s foreign wars. He
added that they are generally willing
to die for things in which they be-
lieve, but are not overly-enthusiastic
to engage in “wholesale murder.”
He stressed the need of debunking
war as a gallant thing.

He plotted three main courses of
action against war: education, organ-
ization, and legislation. Most im-
portant, he declared, are the ﬁrst two.
In the matter of organization, he
said, the most effective methods are
discussion groups, plays, plebiscites,
and distribution of literature. He
explained also that legislation favor-
_able to neutrality may be furthered
by pressure on senators and con-
gressmen. - -

, First Woman In‘ Long Line

Of Famous McMasters

To Receive Diploma

 

The name McMaster-—1ong a fa-
miliar one on rolls of the University

a diploma. But this time, the cur-
rent subject, Margery Louis McMas-
ter, Ed37, will achieve a singular
honor.

Miss McMaster, who will be gradu-
ated from the University this June,
will be the ﬁrst coed graduate in the
McMaster family. And members of
the McMaster family have been grad-
uating from the University regularly
during ‘the past 100 years.

Her great--grandfather,
McMaster, received a bachelor of arts
degree in 1837, exactly a century
ago. Andrew McMaster’s diploma is
now a prize collection of the Univer-
sity, the oldest original diploma in its
possession.

But the great-grandfather’s record
is surpassed by his brother John, who
ﬁnished his college work 110 years
ago.

The McMaster tradition was almost

broken in the 1850’s when John’s son
Gilbert attended Miami University.
The mistake was rectiﬁed in time.
however, and Gilbert returned to
Pittsburgh to study law.
- No more McMasters graduated un-
til 1872, when two members of the
family completed scholastic careers.
These were sons of Andrew, both
named Robert—-—Robert Barclay Mc-
Master and Robert R. l\/l'cMaster.

The next descendant was graduated
in 1895. This time it was A. Bar-

1?

A tentative playoff lineup has been
set by ‘Mr. Feely. In the upper

tered. First round battles .ﬁnd Theta

probably be hotter than the Interfrat

College. " - “

For years the metaphorical football
of the C.onference,' the team_ which
every other entry .could kick. about
practically at will,” Penn State has
this year been the dark“ horse of the
league. In fa_ct,~tl1e last Pitt-State
game was tied at .16-16 at half -time.

Panthers In Slump

And the. contest tomorrow. on the
Lion’s home ﬂfoor, should prove even
tougher for the Carlsonmen to win.

Although they snapped their three-
game «~_losing_» streak by defeating,
Georgetown Tuesday ‘night, the Pan-
thers still appear to be in a slump.
P-erli-aps it's staleness, maybe the
competition has been unusually.t.ough,_
but whatever the rcasoli, the Carlson-
men _ have been declining steadily
since -their all—time high in the ﬁrst
Duquesne .g'ame... . . . ..

Nevertheless, Pitt must be given
the edge in tomorrow’s encounter.
The Lions have nothing at stake,-
whilc the Panthers would be virtually
eliminated from Conference competi-

ity and the spirit to come througli
when it needs the points, and the re-
sults foreordain a Panther victory.

-.Jesko’s The Man. I '

Billy Jesko, Panther captain and
high scorer, should have an excellent
opportunity tom'or_row to “paid his
total and go a little farther toward
catching West Virginia’s Gocke, top
Conference point-getter.

State’s new coach, Johnny Lawther,
late of Westminster, has worked won-
ders with a sport which has always
been more or less in the background
at State College. He has made some
rather unorthodox moves, one of
which was to bench his captain and
star forward,_ but he seems to he get-
ting‘ results." - ’ T   I

Among the men he has developed
is S-.01 Miehoﬁ‘, a thorn in the Pan-
ther’s claw during the last Pitt-State
ga~me,.an'd acclaimed one of the best
forwards to perform at the Stadium
this season. i "   » .-

Dr. Carlson will in all probability
start Jesko, Joe Garcia, Joe Fabel,
Myles Zeleznick, and Bob Johnson,
wh1le_ Lawther sends out Miehoﬁ’,
McW1lliams, Smith, Kornick, and
Corbin.

To do this," I spent months talcing
singing lessons. And with this added
strain, my throat was not in good

that when choosing cigarettes, I select:

66 IGHTFUL ELECTOR of the crown of this

realm” were the words o_f introduction.
which "Betty Quarrie, as Alma Mater, used in;

presenting Ruth Farrell Bowser for coronation
as Senior Queen in June, 1934. ,Chosen for her
character,‘ personality,
leadership and service to Pitt, Ruth was invested
with the symbols of her rights—the imperial robe,
ensign of the garments of the mind; the orb,
symbol of the sphere of her inﬂuence; the ring,
emblem of her great circle of friends; the
scepter, ensign of the authority of her. mind and
heart; and ﬁnally, the crown of honor. "After
she had placed the crown on Ruth’s head, Alma
Mater gave this charge: ' .

“So lay hold
of the life of
the spirit that
when you have
ﬁnished your
c o u r s e, you
may then re-
c e i v e t h e
crown of glory,
that fadeth not
a w a y, which
God,‘the right-
e o u s J udge.
shall give you

R u t h’s an-
swering smile
and bow were
beautiful. She
was indeed “a
lovely 1 a d y,
garmented in
l i g h t, from
her own beau-
ty.” Then es-
corted to the throne by Truth an’d_Valor, _she
was enthroned in all hearts. The choir sang joy-
ously, “Rejoice, Rejoice, Give Thanks and Sing !”
and all joined heartily in praise of her and swore
allegiance in their hearts. And then Alma ,Mater
expressed her greatest wish:

“May you this day, the embodiment. of.the

womanhood of the University of Pittsburgh,

stand fast" forever more like as the sun.”
And Ruth’s face shone.

And she will “stand fast forever mor.e;” "So
long as University records of women endure,
whether in written‘ word or in tradition, the spirit
of Ruth Farrell Bowser will live and serve the
University she loved so well. Though heads are
bowed, and hearts are. grieved today, the "Uni-
versity rejoices in and gives thanks for Ruth
Bowser, conﬁdent that‘ shehas now achieved
“the crown that fadeth not away,” the immor-
tality of an undying spirit. -

Youvvho intend To Pledge:

0 YOU ARE DECIDING about fraternities.
You have been at the University long enough

RUTH FARRELL BOWSER

to know fraternities, fraternity women, and

whether or not you are interested in becoming
a fraternity woman. Panhellenic Council, by
deferring the rushing season until the second
semester has given_you the opportunity to gain
that knowledge. « -

If you wish to become a fraternity member
you know it ‘now. That decision is yours and
yours alone. No one should tell you what to
do, unless that person knows you and your re-
actions to group life and group thinking as well
as you yourself should know them. Now, if
you decide to pledge a fraternity, it is a matter
of determining'j_ust which fraternity it shall be.

In these,_‘thr,ee;"d-ays" of formal rushing you are
meeting the; fraternities’..as ..gi1ou—ps for the first
time—and’it is as groups that you should be
thinking of them. It is not any one woman, or two,
or evena whole class of women who count, but
the esprit-de-corps which uniﬁes the group; for
fraternity life is group social life, and it is this
coordination. that determines their success or
failure.  :

For every rushee there remains the danger
of being dazzled by the crowded days of rushing
season. Each of you should remember that the
fraternity, like the rushee, puts its best foot for-
ward during those three days. With that in
mind, you won’t be overwhelmed by the sudden
concentration of attention, but will think back
instead to those women whom you have come to
know in an informal way over the luncheon tables
for the pastvsemester.

Size, age, the pin, or even the reputation of
the fraternity—al1 those thingsyou have heard
discussed—are not the most important things in
selecting a fraternity. The important thing is
you. Choosing a fraternity is like ﬁtting together
the pieces of a jig-saw puzzle. You are the miss-
ing piece and must ﬁnd the place in which you
ﬁt best. For every rushee there is a right fra-
ternity, and that fraternity is the one in which
you can be your best self.

A fraternity is not a necessary requirement
to success or happiness on this campus, but, like
the many similar extra-curricular activities, it
offers op.portunit.y.—A. Fraternity Woman,

Back in the days4_(‘1908) when tlieundergrads were.

singing “After the" Ball Is Ove'i"”-'*i’.‘i‘oin their high white
collars, Dr. John ‘S’. A.sli_bi:ook ’11~be.gun_ to i*ccogni_:;c a
need‘ and demand on campus for a Varsity Show. ‘
That same year he gatlicrcd about him a niunbei’-of
loyal University rnenaiicl organized the Cap and Gown

Club. W ith- the initial Capand Gowniproduction _“Wup~..

land,” began the history of drama at the University. _
From 1908_'to 1912 the shows lasted but one night,

but froiii Lliese _pi-oiluclioiis ’(:2‘tl“mT:_l‘i‘u:l'i Sl1('l1’_ftS I)r, C, 

Hagan ,’1‘l, and Dix: '—l‘hu1'low W. Brand, 13, whose in-

terest in.Cap-and 2Gown was laigely responsible  the"

growth of the club’_s activities.

It is interesting, to note that “Here and Therc,’i’ 1910

production, gave tous the famous college song "Hail to
Pitt.” In 1912 and 1913 G.-Norman ,Re1S,_’16. and. Gus
Schnabel, ’15, began to collabora'.te'~on scriptsand they
have been doing it ever since. __ ' .- 

In 1916 “Suite 16” ;ran three nights and one after-
noon at the Schenley Theatre as well_ as a half dozen
trips to the hin_terlands of Western _-Pennsylvania. It
was not until‘ ‘1923 that the show ran a full week at
a downtown theatre. The beginning of the decade was
marked by the appearance of Regis Toomey on_gCap and
Gown stage. Toomey later became an outstandi.11g.ino_vie
star. ' ' . . ‘

Under '_:t;he- coaching regime of ‘Jtlie late _Wa;l.ter, ‘B.
Edmundsoir and Mrs. Gus Schnabel g-the all-mens show
achieved akfair measure of success" in the period from
1923 to 1929, but enthusiastic alumni‘ and underg'1‘aclu-
ates had broader ideas concerning the, group than were
being put into_practi'c"e -in those years. They wanted 
show to compare with-‘those of_the1_ large eastern uni-
versities. In the latter year application was made to the
governor of the stat'e_.fni' a ::r:r_:o1i(l class corporation. en-
titled “the Gi=aduatc ff-3.-liib of the University of Pitts-
burgh.” Since that time all affairs of the organization
have been handled by the Graduate ‘Club. _E_ve1'y_ year
some 300 students try out for about 100 positions in the
cast, chorus, managerial, and techni_ca.l ends of produc-
tion. The Uiidergraduate Cap and Gown Club, f_ormed 1]‘.
1926, rewards outstanding men with membership in the
organization. .

Several prominent di1'epto1*s have been in charge of
production during: the 1ast"s'eve1'al years, William Mai‘-
latt, Theodore Viehman and Gene Kelley. Iselley and
Carl B. Cass, Pitt Players director, th1s_week—-a year
after Nick Spanos and Bob Safl’ron revived the t1‘8.(lI.‘-‘
tion of student-written scripts with “Out for the Count‘
—bcgin tryouts for another show by the two under-
grads and G. Norman Reis, Cap and Gown’s thirtieth.

Pitt Players Grganiz ed

Eight years after Dr. Aslibrook conceived Cap «S:
Gown, Pitt Players appeared on campus. The ineniii
the University were forming Intercollegiate Proliibition
Association about the same time. Whether the liquor
problem was more important to the boys in those days
or whether the dyed-in-the-wool drama enthusiasts were
few and far between is a question. It is a fact, though.
that the Players group did nothing remarkable till 1920,
when they were 1‘COl‘g‘€t11lZed. One-act plays were the rule
until Mrs. McQueen and Mr. Whit-ed took charge. In
1924, they introduced the systein whereby three or four
major plays are produced each year.

Since then many notable productions have been listed

in the archives -of University drama liistory. We can
mention but a‘ few: “Midsummer Night’s Di‘eai'n,” di
rected by Miss Jane Ellen Ball, ’27, in her first year as
the thespians’ director, constitutes their first and only
attempt of Sliakespeaie; “The Cradle Song” had one
of its ﬁrst trials in a university theatre; Players gave
“Black Flamingo” its world premiere in 1929; Mr. Cass
assumed ‘his duties with the Players in 1930-1931. l'l9.l‘-
alded as one of the most capable directors in the ﬁeld.
his seven years of production at the University have
helped to place Pitt Players equal with the ranking
Little Theatre groups of the city. Perhaps his most nota-
ble production was the early nineteenth century comedy
“Fashion,” which rated a drama page streamer headline
in a downtown newspaper. This week, Mr. Cass’s assist-
ant, Mr. Charles Foreman, makes his debut as a Players
director with the current “Square Peg." - .

Fl_v’s Eye View!

Zoologists Investigate Image
Perception Of Insects

 

What constitutes a‘ ﬂy’s eye view
of the world is the basis of a major
experiment in the zoology ‘division of
the department of biology these days.
More technically__ speaking, it has to
do with image perception of insects.

Procedure for this experiment ne-
cessitates the use of several boxes
with different values of light shining
through an opening on the side. The
subject is placed in the box and light
is allowed to ﬁlter through the open-
mg.

As light enters the box, the inten-
sity is measured. The reaction of
the insect to diﬁ'erent.lights aids in
determining the amount of sight.

From the lighted box the subject is
taken to a dark one. If the reaction
to dark is the same as that to light,
the result is considered negative. If
it differs, the result is positive.
