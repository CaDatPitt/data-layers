Internships

By KAREN GRZYBICKI

Pitt students can leam firsthand
what a professional job is really like
through the university Internship
Office.

Brenda Manning, the university

intership co-ordinator, explained_

the intership program.

“The whole aim of the program"

is to get a student to look and
behave like a professional.” said
Manning. “The — student’s
marketability rises because they
learn‘ firsthand what a professional
job is. They know how to apply for
the job they want, and how to han-
dle an interview.”

There are 250 internships that a
student can consider. They are filed
in the Internship Office in 213

recognized as official university
organizations.

An organization "must be
recognized by the university in
order to use the university’s name,
reserve rooms, and seek funding,
according Clarke. 0

All new groups are granted par-
tial recognition during their first
term and are given $100.00 with
which to buy supplies, Clarke said.
If the group retains more than 25
members, it may be awarded full
recognition and may seek unlimited

Schenley Hall, corresponding to
academic majors. Within these
separate catalogues, the internships
are divided into four groups, from
those being the least difficult to ob-
tain to those being the most dif-
ficult. V

This cataloguing system is set up
to give a student an idea of what the
chances are of obtaining a par-

, -ticular internship. -

The minimum requirements for
each internship differ. Some re-
quire astudent, with a specific ma-
jor and a minimum quality point
average, who is in a certain year of
school, while others are open to
students- with any major in any year

of their undergraduate career.

- However, the best time to take an

internship is after the sophomore

year, including the summer prior to‘

the junior year, according to Man-
ning. Students on probation are not
recommended to apply, she added.

The first thing an interested stu-
dent should do is attend one of the
information meetings held by the
internship office. These meetings
are scheduled throughout the first

,six weeks of the Fall and Winter

terms. The hour—long sessions pro-
vide an orientation to the program,
and brieﬂy outline the procedures a

funds, she added.

Clarke said the guidelines follow-
ed in previous years were time-
consuming and often created un-

necessary work. Last year, stude1Lt__

organizations were required to sub-
mit an information packet that in-
cluded an updated constitution, an
updated set of by-laws, and a letter
from the advisor stating that he or
she would act in an advisory capaci-
ty, she said. The Allocations Com-
mittee then reviewed the informa-
tion and interviewed each organiza-

student must follow to enroll in the
program. Attendance is man-
datory. ’

The students then must become
familiar with the internships on file

\ in the counseling center, and make
a list of which are the most appeal-
ing. _An internship advisor will then
discuss these internships with the

students, along with the re-
quirements for obtaining them.

“The advisers are the heart of the
system,” Manning said. “The stu-
dent receives personal attention
and getsta chance to get the kind of
internships that will be the most
beneficial.” ‘

A student is then required to
prepare a resume and attend an in-
terview workshop. This will
prepare the student to interview the

"internship supervisor who_ will ad-
vise him on his job throughout the
course of the term.

Once the student has had an in‘-
terview with his prospective intern-
ship supervisor, hetmust attend a
contract workshop. There, the stu-
dent will learn to draft the contract
for the internship. The contract is
an agreement for independent
study, because the internship office,
as a counseling center, is not able to
a_ward__, academic credit.

tion and determined whether the
organization would be granted full
or partial recognition, according to
Clarke.

Under the Committee’s‘ new
guidelines, Clarke said, the fylly
recognized student organizations
have been divided into four parts,
one of which will be reviewed each
year. She added‘ that partially
recognized: organizations will be
‘reviewed every year, pending a
change in recognition status.

All organizations are still re-

The contract is written to gain
faculty sponsorship, and it must

‘ define specifically what the student

will submit as albasis for grading, as
well as the time each student expects
to -spend each week on the intern-
ship. '

Credit is granted on the quality of
the time spent--not quantity--and it
is up to the faculty sponsors to
decide how much credit the student
will be granted. Thetcontract that
the student draws up will be used to
negotiate for the number of credits
given. This, in effect, is the com-
pensation that the student receives.
The student, in most cases, does not
expect to be paid. The contract
‘must then be signed by both the
faculty sponsor and the internship
supervisor. Then the student is per-
mitted to register through indepen-

dent study.

The ‘student will receive two
grades, one -from the internship
supervisor: for on-the-job perfor-
mance, and one from his faculty
sponsor on the work submitted, ac-
cording to the terms of the contract.
The faculty sponsor then evaluates
both grades, and his decision on a
final grade is absolute. ' " ’

quired to submit an information
packet, Clarke said. The Alloca-
tions Committee will review the in-
formation from each organization
and will interview the organiza-
tionsthat are scheduled for review
that year, according to Clarke.
They will also interview all partially
recognized organizations, and any
whose information packets are not
complete or raise questions in the
Committee, Clarke said. All other
organizations will automatically re-
tain the same recognition they
received last year, she added.

Give Pitt Students A Taste of the Real World

The steps to obtaining an intern-
ship appear intimidating but Man-
ning maintains “motivation is the
most important thing: students who
are willing to go through the steps
can find an internship that they
want. The students that we see are
anxious about what they will be do-
ing after graduation. They want to
find out about their carreers.”

Many who complete an intern-
ship,,‘however, find out that the
kind of work that they did was not
what they thought it would be.

“It doesn’t matter if the intern-
ship 'isn’t it,” "Manning said.
“What is important is that the
students accept_the. knowledge of a
particular kind of job. The recep-
[tion anywhere will be much better
because of the internship ex-
perience..’ ’

The internship office will be con-
ducting two more information
meetings this week. Attendence at
one of these meetings is mandatory

to enroll in the program. These
meetings are scheduled on Thurs-
day, Oct. 16 from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m.
in 204 Student Union and Friday
from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. in 204 Stu-
dent Union.

SCRANTON, Pa.—Democratic

' . U.S. Senate candidate Pete Flaherty

turned on the radio in his rented
Oldsmobile, but didn’t seem to hear
the song blaring from the rock sta-
tion--“Have You Heard ‘About the_

_ Lonesome Loser.”

Two years ago, that was Pete
Flaherty, defeated in his lonely at-
tempt to win the governorship. Her

_ shunned the Democratic Partyand

tried to run the campaign _by
himself. ,.

Flaherty says he’s learned his
lesson for his latest contest against

, Republican Arlen Specter.

Flaherty is working with the par-
ty, has a 15-member staff to worry
about things such as scheduling and
research, and even has someone to
drive him to campaign stops.

“We have a more efficient.cam-
paign,” he said, sitting-in the front,

ed up Interstate 81 south of here.
“In. 1978, I spent half my time

running the campaign and the other -

half campaigning. I found out that
doesn't work,” he said.

As for the party, he said its
leadership has “undergone drastic
changes” in the past two years.
Gov; Milton Shapp ‘and
Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo
are out of office and the
Philadelphia Democrats have new
blood pumping in their system.

“I’m working closely with Mayor is
Bill Green and city Democrat chief

Dave Glancey...to have a big effort
in Philadelphia on my behalf,”
Flaherty said.

To win statewide, Flaherty «must
follow the strategy usually reserved

for Republicans: hold his opponent.

to under 100,00 in the city.
Glancey said he thinks the goal is

reachable, largely because ‘ of

Flaherty’s peace-making efforts.

In-the campaign’s closing weeks,

   

 

Flaherty said he will take aim at
what he feels are Repvblican at-
tempts to misrepresent his record as
mayor of Pittsburgh and his stands
on various national issues;
Flaherty said he has been incor-
rectly accused of opposing the MX
missile system and draft registra-
tion, not publishing position
papers, refusing to debate, allowing

Pittsburgh’s bridges to deteriorate

and costing the city 34,000 jobs.

“He’ll say anything,” Flaherty‘

said of Specter. “He just makes up

statistics as he goes along. I ’m going I

to straighten him out. I'm not going
to. let him get away with it.”

For his part, Flaherty repeatedly
chastises Specter for accepting a
$525,000 campaign contribution
from’ the Senate Republican cam-
paign fund, headed by Penn-
sylvania Sen. John Heinz.

Flaherty says the money came
straight from big oil, making
Specter a captive of special ‘in-

  ORGANIATIONS    

‘Without recognition, yo connot request funds or use Univer

terests. ~

“I think voters are tired of people
going to Washington who are tied
in with special interests,” Flaherty
said. “That’s where I place Specter;
he just fits‘ right in.”

In his defense, Specter says the
money came from small con-
tributors, althoughhe said some oil
company executives have given to
his campaign. "

Flaherty is not without his cor-
porate friends. U.S. Steel Chairman
David Roderick gave a $500 dona-
tion, but Flaherty says it's different

-because Roderick is a boyhood

friend and the amount was small.
For his own campaign, Flaherty

has raised about $350,000 to

ed for television advertising.

He hopes to convince voters that
his experience as Pittsburgh mayor
makes him the best choice for U.S.
Senate. , _ ~

During his term between 1970

and 1977, he dealt with problems of V

the poor, elderly, and unemployed
and balanced’ seven budgets, he

said.
He said outside auditors and"

researchers gave his administration
high marks and that he won
renomination to the job by both the
Democratic and Republican parties.

In contrast, Specter has served
only as a district attorney, said
Flaherty.

Ellen Gay Detlefsen, associate
professor in‘ithe department of
Library Science, School of Library
and Information Science (SLIS), is
editor of the‘ recently published
“National Directory of Mental
Health.” John Wiley and Sons is
publisher of this guide to adult out-
patient mental health facilities
prepared in cooperation with Neal-
Schuman Publishers, Inc.

The book’s “Directory of

Facilities and Services” lists 3600_

outpatient centers —- institutes,

if I hospitals, private facilities, clinics,

community health centers, and sup-
port groups. Additionally the
directory supplies addresses,
telephone numbers, services, types
of staff personnel and types of
therapy, types of referrals accepted,
fees, and waiting times. The book’s
‘Guide to Selecting Mental Health
Services and Practitioners” iden-
tifies seventeen types_ of mental
health workers and lists state men-
tal health associations and national
hotline numbers. It includes also an
“Index to Services and Therapies”

 identifying specific types of service.‘

Deltefsen began collecting data
from the directory when she was
associated with the libraryof itffe
Western Psychiatric Institute and

._’ J? V_ --

Later, graduate students at SLIS,
were employed as editorial

directory- information.
Dr. Martha Manheimer, pro-
fessor in the department of Library

Science, is the author of two recent "

publications: “OCLC: An In-
troduction to searching and Input,”
published by Neal—Schuman

edition of “Cataloging and

-Classification, A Workbook,”

from Marcel Dekker, Inc. Both
books were developed in response
to’a need for teaching materials and
guides suitable for classroom and
individual use.

“The Workbook” is volume 30
in the series “Books in Library and
Information Science.”Allen Kent,
associate dean of SLIS, acted as
general editor. Having met with
success in its original form, it has
been revised and expanded to con- i
‘form to the second edition of the
Anglo-American Cataloguing_

“OCLC: An Introduction” will be
of great value as a guide to working
professionals in their study and use
of new techniques and technologies,

as well as to students preparing to

enter the professional world.

violator, setting up a mandatory
meeting with the student and staff
members of the Office of Residence
Life. ~

‘The ORL brings the RHJB into
the picture after a student refuses to
attend the mandatory meeting or
continues to violate the policy,
Snyder said. '

A complaint is filed by the Office
of Residence Life to Charlene
Hunter, the coordinator of the
university Student Judicial System.

“They (ORL) have to allege with
specificity that the student has
violated at least one of the offenses -
under the code,” said Hunter.

' “They have to give me a factual

narrative of what actually happen-
ed: tell me_what witnesses saw
whatever happened, what evidence
they might submit at the hearing,
and they have to sign the

’ -- ..

 

/
complaint.”

After Hunter reviews‘ the com- a

plaint, she then assigns the case to
one of the two judicial advocates
(second year law students) who
serves as prosecutor and sets the
hearing date. Notice goes out tothe
student on-_ when and where the
hearing will be held, according to
Hunter. The student also receives a
copy of the code, a copy of the
complaint, and information stating
that the Legal Awareness Commit-
tee is available to represent them.

The RHJB is a standing body"
made up of 20 residence hall
students who are not on academic
or disciplinary probation, Hunter
said.

Five members serve on individual
cases and act as a jury. To recom-

_mend a sanction, a majority of

three members must agree.

“The RHJB has jurisdiction over
all resident students for non-
academic disciplinary matters,”said
Hunter.‘ “The maximum sanction
it can recommend is residence hall
dismissal.’ ’

Hunter reported that over spring
and summer term almost 40 com-
plaints concerning violations of the
visitation policy were filed, but
some were dismissed for technincal
reasons.

“All the cases that were filed
against students were repeat
violators,” she added. “They
violated the policy on the average of
at least five times before a com-’

plaint was filed and refused to meet
with staff members after repeated
letters.” _
. Sanctions recommended,‘ by the
R-HJ B for visiting policy violations
this summer were loss of visitation

By The Associated Press
Lebanon, Pa. - A mentally ill
Cuban refugee accused of fatally
assaulting a“ fellow Cuban at a reset-

sent to a federal institution in

said Tuesday.
Lebanon County D.A. .David
‘Brightbill said a six-week state

police investigation revealed that

19-year-old Manuel Rodriguez was
attacked by Rogelio Tellestoro Diaz
Rodriguez, 30, during Aug. 5 riots
at Fort Indiantown Gap. ‘
Manuel Rodriguez died Aug. 19
in the nearby Hershey Medical
Center, as a result of head injuries

“The investigation disclosed that
Diaz Rodriguez, the alleged slayer,
was not a member of any security-
type force at the time of the inci-
dent. The attack was not related to
the riots but was the result of a per-
sonal animosity between the par-
ties,” Brightbill said in a statement.

The Cubar_1—Haitian Task Force
of the U.S. State Department said
Diaz Rodriguez was transferred
Monday to the Medical Center for
Federal Prisoners in Springfield,

medical and mental evaluation.

esqueezing the

Middle class

The squeeze /on the‘ middle class is getting tighter

and tighter.

Pitt’s medical school received notification last
week that federal aid to the school will be cuf.

In addition, the Graduate Medical Education Na-
tional Advisory Committee has issued a report
predicting that at the present rate of enrollment,
there will be a surplus of 70,000 doctors by 1990.

The clean of Pitt’s medical school, Dr. Donald F.
Leon, said the grant reductions will cause a hike in

tuition.

The need to lower enrollments and raise tuition

means someone will have to suffer.

According to Francis Drew, the medical school’s
associate dean of student affairs, it is the middle in-
come studentwho will be hurt the most. -

Pitt medical school students believe that only the
afﬂuent will be able to enter med-ical schools, because
the aid reduction will result in lower minority
enrollments and higher tuition. .  .

However, Drew reasoned that lower income and ‘
minority students will have greater access to scholar-
ships and aid than middle class students.

‘Although it is inevitable that, in reducing a
surplus, cutbacks have to be made, one group or
class should not be singled out to bear the weight of

the reductions.

The government has the responsibility of ensuring
that, in easing the surplus, cutbacks are distributed

evenly among all groups.

The affluent can pay their own way and lower in-
come and minority students have access to federal aid
and scholarships._But,the middle class students, who
can’t afford rising tuition, should also be eligible to

' receive government money.

This, however, would not solve the problem of a
surplus of doctors. Therefore, enrollments should
consist of a representative percentage from the

economic groups.

The federal government has to realize that
eliminating a surplus of doctors should not mean

By LARRY LUNSFORD

The University of Pittsburgh has

' established itself as a perennial
-power in intercollegiate football.

The team is widely respected across
the country, but ironically, it ap-
pears as though the respect is.less in
Pittsburgh than it is elsewhere.
The first game I ever saw at Pitt

‘ ' was the Panthers’ contest against

 

\

Notre Dame the first game of the '

1977-78 season. Even though Pitt
lost. the stadium was packed to

‘capacity, and I was impressed with

the support for the Pitt football
team. That was the last time I saw
thestadium full at Pitt.

In 1976 Pittpwon the national
football championship. The Pan-
thers went 11-0 that year, beat

-E Georgia in the\Sugar Bowl, and

Tony Dorsett won the Heisman
Trophy. The average attendance
that year at home was 44,03l—in a
stadium that holds 56,500. ‘Where
‘were the fans?

The following year, for some odd
reason, the attendance increased to
an average of 47,978 per game. In
1978, it rose to 49,472, which hap-
pens to be the largest average home

K attendance in Pitt’s history, and last
year, the total fell to 44,951.

With the expectation that Pitt
had a shot at another national
championship this year, the fans
have been turning out for the home
games, and attendance for Pitt’s
first two home games was in the
mid-forties.’

For four years now I have been
surprised ‘at the ,relatively small
crowds at Pitt home football
games. If this was a school which
annually lost more games than it
won, then I could understand why
more fans don’t come out to sup-
port the team, but Pitt has proven
itself to be one of the topteamsin
the country each year. It _is very
rare to find _a home game of other
top teams in the country that is not
sold out. Try to get aticket to a
home Michigan, Penn State,
Florida State, Alabama, or even a
West Virginia football game. The

only home games that normally sell ‘

out at Pitt are against either Penn
State or Notre Dame.

Many folks in Pittsburgh were
surprised when Johnny Majors left
Pitt the same year that he won the
national championship. One of the

{reasons that Majors left, was

becausegof the lack of support for

\ ,,.,.,..._' ."

.~\-,.'_  ‘.

  Answers Needed to Problem of Little Support  

the Panthers’, grid team. In his first
year back at his alma mater, Ten-
nessee, Major’s average home at-
tendance was 74,000 for a team that
finished with a 4-7 record. Ten-I
nessee now boasts the second
largest stadium in the country with
around 99,000 seats, and every ~
game this year has been sold out
even though the Vols got off to an
0-2 start at home.

‘ I don’t buy the reasons that I
hear around Pittsburgh as to why
more people don’t go to Pitt games.
The student section sold out this
year——l0,000 seats, so I don’t
blame the students. I blame the
alumni and the other folks in Pitts-
burgh who should be coming out on
Saturday to watch the Panthers.
The biggest excuse I've heard is that
Pittsburghers don’t support the
Panthers because of the Steelers.
That can’t be the case because so
few’ people get the opportunity to
go‘ to a Steeler’s game. Every
Steeler game has been, is, and will
continue to be sold out, and only a
wait of years might afford an in-
dividual the chance to’ever.get on
the list to buy season tickets. The
latter is virtually impossible in that
those who have season tickets and
want to get rid of them normally
just pass the option on to 3 relative
or friend. There just isn’t any sensi-
ble reason to use the Steelersas an
excuse not to support the‘ Panthers.

The only viable reason ltcan see

g

      

that folks don’t want to come into
Oakland to a Pitt football game is
the tremendous hassle it is to come
into Oakland for anything, much
less a football game.

are always under construction (can.

you think of a single year in recerif
memory that Fifth Avenue hasn t

. been torn up?), and most folks
evidently just don’t want to have to 0

put up with the hassle of com-
muting to a Pitt game. . .
Undoubtedly the athletic depart-
ment officials are concerned about
the small numbers at home games.
Why else would they continually
sponsor youth days whereby kids
get in for a mere dollar? Why else
do they continue to have high
school band days and cheerleading
days and all the other kind of days
you can think of‘? Certainly it is
good public relations for Pitt, but it
also brings in the numbers to the
stands. Do you think that other
schools in the top twenty have to do
this? Not many.

Use Persuasion, Not Force

‘ By NICK ARNETT V
Pitt News Staff Writer

There’ ‘is a tendency emerging
from Pitt’s administration to bring
change about through coercion
rather than persuasion. Force is be-
ing substituted for encouragement.

Two recent administration pro-
jects have exemplified this
regressive attitude--the dormitory
visiting policies and the Student
Media and Publications Board.’
' The new dorm policies were ap-
parently spurred by amurder which
took place. in one of the Towers.

. However, The Pitt News has
written at length in the past about
the dorm policies. There is no point
in further criticizing them, I only
point them out as a manifestation
of -the -adminstration’s attitude.

Although coercion can teach, it is
not the proper means for a universi-
ty to educate. It implies nearly the

opposite’-.-that the coerced person
cannot learn, and thus must be
forced to behave in the proper man-

118!‘ '
In the form of the new Student

Media and Publications Board, the
administration has again
endeavored to bring about change
through coercion and supervision.
Although it" appears clear that the
university had the legal right to set
the dorm policies, it is clearer that

the university does not have any

right to inﬂuence the content of stu-
dent media. '

The board’s Constitution em-
powers it to approve the editorial.
policies of the student media, in-
cluding The Pitt News. _

It is completely against this coun-
try’s tradition of a free press to
have a newspaper, even a student
newspaper, beholden to any outside.
group. _

The Pitt News is a voice of the

university community. It is the stu-
dent newspaper, and control of the
content of the student newspaper
must rest exclusively in the hands of
students.

The Pitt News has been criticized
for a lack of journalistic quality. It

is far less than it could potentially-

be. The means toimpgove the paper
_is in the hands of the adminstration,
but it is not a forceful means.

The adrninstration of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh has the best
means available to improve the
quality of The Pitt News--teaching.
Teaching is the university’s primary
mission; it should be" used as the
university’s primary tool.

A Perhaps it would be- hypocritical
to suggest that the university force
students to learn to write. However,

“That (Saturday night against
Florida State) was the worst we've
ever played defensively,” said head

‘ coach Jackie Sherrill at yesterday’s

.-football _press conference. “We

‘ missed 19 tackles and had a lot of

penalties called on us.”

‘ The defensive mistakes will not
be the onlyxitem to correct on Sher-
“rill’s agenda. Offensively, the Pan-
thers turned the ball over seven
times. The Panther coach hinted

. that the sloppy play may have been

partially due to the distractions that
were evident. '

“Offensively, we turned the ball

over at the wrong place,” said Sher-
-rill. “The distractions got to the
point where it affected us.”

Pitt has many, players that come
from the south, especially from
‘around the state of Florida.
According to Sherrill, since — the
players do not have the opportunity
to go homefrequently, if at all, to
suddenly be able to see and visit
with family caused a distraction and

‘a lack of self-discipline.

“If I had to do it over again, I’d
have kept them 40 miles out of town
in some small mot/el,” said_Sherrill.

Coach Sherrill quickly turned his
attention from last Saturday to this
Saturday against West Virginia.

' West Virginia possesses a potent of-

fensive attack as evident from scor-

ing ill, 52, 31, and 45 points against ‘-

Cincinnati,. Colorado State, Rich-

’ mond - and-» Virginia, respectively.

The key ‘to the Mountie offense will

"be quarterback Oliver Luck.

“Oliver Luck is to their (WVU)
_ offense what Bill Hurley was to the
Syracuse offense,” Sherrill said.
Panther fans should remember Bill
Hurley very well as he was always a
thorn in Pitt’s side and, although he
never beat the Panthers, Hurley
always made it a close game.

Luck was limited in playing time
against Hawaii last week, so there
was some question to whether or
not he would be starting against
Pitt. ‘As West Virginia coach Don
Nehlen said, “If he’s not (starting),
I’m not coming.” _

West Virginia comes off a loss to
Hawaii by a score of 16-13, a game

“We’re better than Hawaii, we

According to the WVU coach,
the team is on schedule for what he
hoped to attain as the first year
head coach. Only problem is that
he would have liked to come into
the Panther game with a record of
5-1 instead of 4-2. But either way,
the Mounties are expected to enter
Pitt Stadium ready to play football.
‘ Said Nehlen, “Our kids will gear

With Pitt’s running game under
constant scrutiny, Joe Daniels,the

some things to say.

“I’m pleased with the backs as a

Whether or not McMillan is hit-.

there is no argumentthat he should

“Rooster” Jones has an ankle in-
jury and probably will not be able

to play. According to Daniels, Ar- .

trell Hawkins may start and Joe
McCall will be his back-up.
-When pressed to explain the cur-

. rent dilemma at the tailback psition
for Pitt, Daniels said that Jones is -

the number one back if he’s ready
to play. Although Joe McCall is
presently‘ the third string tailback
behind Jones and Hawkins, accor-
ding to Daniels, McCall would be
number one because of his poten-
tial.

“Joe McCall has a great potential
and if he progresses as he should,
he’ll be as good a back as there is
around,” said Daniels. “We’re try-
ing to play him a little more each
week.” ,

Daniels added that he doesn’t
think a tailback problem exists,

“Problems are created by people
talking about it (referring to the

with the backs where they said that
they wanted the ball more. Doing
everything (running and pass cat-
ching) is all part of playing
football, ” said Daniels.

Randy McMillan and Dwight
Collins reiterated the offensive
strategy that Daniels stated.

“We have‘ a good thing going
with the passing game so why mess
up a good thing?” said McMillan.
“I would like the ball more but
every back should say that. But we
should stay with it (passing).”

Dwight Collins said he enjoys
playing ﬂanker and really doesn’t
miss playing halfback.

“I was a little tall. for the
backfield but I’m' comfortable, at
flanker,” Collins said. “I’1l go
after it (ball) no matter where it is,”
he said, referring to his great leap-
ing ability. “‘It’s just Danny throw-
ing the ball and Dwight going after
it.” ’

The last factor to talk about is the

loss to the Seminoles. .

“A lot of players took it hard bu
we can still come back and win the
Eastern championship,” said
McMillan. “We were disappointed
real bad, especially the defensive
players.” ,

McMillan, because of that com-
ment, seemd to realize that maybe
the national championship was a bit

out of reach. But he also said that
being a veteran team, which Pitt is,
will help them to bounce back.

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Sports Writer

With IIVP consecutive wins under
their belt and an undefeated streak
at home, the Panther booters have a
number of things that they credit
their successful season to this fall.
Improvements- have been made in
leaps and bounds in both the
physical and the mental play of the
entire squad of 1980. An individual
player that has returned to the Pan-
ther lineup ready for any type of
opposition is junior goalkeeper
Scott Thunberg. The man who

‘ guards the nets for the 7-2_Panther

booters is only two shutouts short

of tying the Pitt record of six in a—

single season. In his "career to date,
Thpnberg has taken one of the big-

gest jumps of any Panther.

After having a losing career‘ in
high school at Neshaminy Maple
Point in Levittown, Pa., Thunberg
decided to give collegiate ball a try.
Thunberg I made this decision
despite some very disheartening
statistics that he had built up in high
school. His‘ senior year found the
Neshaminy team with a record of
1-13-1. The most amazing statistic
of all was that Thunberg had 501
shots taken at him in only 15 games

'- and _a total of 78 goals scored on

him. _

“I took losses too personallyin
my earlier years in high school,”
said Thunberg. “I.took them home
with me rather than leave them in
the locker room, I learned a lot

from that experience through high‘
school.

Until this season, Thunberg con-
tinued to take losses personally
when he played with the Panthers.
But, things have changed for
Thunberg, in both his physical
capabilities and his attitude towards
the game. Thunberg explains the
reason for such a noticeable
change.

“My_ hopes were built up
freshman year because I got to play

alot of games,” he said. “I .

thought that I would be receiving

more playing time sophomore year ‘

than I did. So I became very deter-
mined to prove myself to coach
(Leo) Bemis. I put in extra time
with Frank (Bucci) working out and

\‘

training before the indoor season.
This improved my reflexes. Indoor
season helped "build my confidence
and I think the team’s confidence in
me.

Thunberg then had the past sum-
mer ahead of him and four months
to put things together for this fall.
Although his playing scholarship
was taken away, he wanted to prove
that the team would benefit with

1 him in the nets.

‘ “I wanted to show the coach and
team that they wouldn’t be making

j any mistakes by putting me in goal

this fall. So I worked hard, joined a
league and played two nights a
_ week. I played with top quality peo-
ple, this just wasn’t some pick up
league, and I learned a great deal. It

Scott Thunberg Minds a Neat Net forBooters  

was the first time that I was playing
with people who worked as a team

\ and knew what they wanted to do.”

This season Thunberg has found‘
that the Panthers are quite similar
to the teams that he played with this
past summer.
has been established and success is

in store for the Panthers in the re— \

mainder of the season.
“Everybody is working together

as a unit, like all the gears of the .

machine are fitting together. Sure,
sometimes it needs a little lubrica-
"tion but everythinggets put back
together again. Sometimes the
team lets down a bit when we’re
ahead, because we’re not really us-
ed to having the big lead.

  Pitt Drops to 1 1th in poll, Alabama Remains First

_ Unranked Rutgershwas anything
but easy pickings for top—ranked
Alabama, but the Crimson Tide’s
17-13 victory over the Scarlet

V Knights was enough to keep Bear

Bryant’s team atop The Associated

Press college football rankings for _

the fifth consectutive week.

' The Tide, who handed Bryant his -

301st career coaching victory, did
lose some ‘support among those who
vote in the nationwide poll of sports
writers and broadcasters, however.
Southern California. Texas and
UCLA all received some first-place
votes. ‘

Alabama, 5-0, was named at the
top of 52 of 68 ballots. But erosion
of its position was evident in view
of the Tide getting 60 of 61 votes
prior to the Rutgers game. The
Tide rolled up 1,327 of a possible
1,360 points. I _

Coming off a 29-10 victory over

Arizona, Southern Cal, 5-0, receiv-
' ed eight first—place votes to compile
1,224 points and retain its No. 2
ranking. Texas, again ranked third,
and UCLA, .moving from ﬁfth to
fourth, each got four first-place
votes. Texas, 5-0, rolled up 1,201
points after. beating Oklahoma
20-13. UCLA, a 35-21 winner over
Stanford got 1,186 points to replace

Pittsburgh, -which fell to 11th after .
losing to Florida State 36-22.
Notre Dame, 4,-0, moved up two

notches to fifth with 1,052 points _

on the strength of its 32-14 pasting
of previously unbeaten Miami, Fla.
That loss dropped the Hurricanes to
18th. Georgia, 5-0, heldkon to the
sixth spot with ‘a 28-21 victory over
Mississippi to compile 1,028 points.

Florida State, 5-1, advanced from
11th position to seventh with ‘921
points thanks to its upset of Pitt.
No. 8 North Carolina; 5-0, held
its position and received 856 points
after whipping Wake Forest _27-9.

Ohio State, 4-1, crushed hapless»
Northwestern 63-0 to remain in‘

ninth place with 819 points, eight
 more than .l0th-ranked Nebraska,

4-1, which devastated Kansas 54-0.

The Second Ten consists of: Pitt,
4-1; Penn, State, 4-1; Baylor, 5-0;
Arkansas, 4-1; South Carolina, 5-1;
Missouri, 4-1; Oklahoma, 2-2;

Miami 4-1; Iowa State, 54), and

“Scalp .,‘Em” and “F-S-U” in
unison. That’s right, 50,000 people
chanting in unison, an eerie sound.
At worst, the fans were thunderous,
and they didn’t let up throughout
the game. ’

. After the win, the celebration.

continued. Not only did the fans_
stick around inside the stadium
after the final whistle had been
blown, but they hung-around out-
side the place for a while after that.
Reports were that the FSU campus
was unbelievable that evening as the
fans toasted their Seminoles long
into, the night and well into the next
morning.

Florida State enthusiasts are truly
football fans and with every game

that passes they prove it more and
more. To aft opposing team there
can be nothing more annoying than
these fans as they just don’t let up,
whether their. team is down by 14

with a minute to go, or up by 14’

"with 10 seconds to go. One reporter

‘ put it best, saying, “I’ve been asked
by many visiting journalists if we
can export our fans to their cities. I
always say ‘No way.”’

And rightly so.
