But there is a rumor that it is a
“bogus” organization-—that it has not

initiation fee. -

The girls have returned from Philly
and although they did not bring back
all the bacon they succeeded in bring-
ing back a nice lean strip and it
wasn’t yellow either. We are proud
of them just the same because--well,
didn’t they beat the team that licked
the other two teams by a large mar-
gin. Ain’t that sumpin’?
