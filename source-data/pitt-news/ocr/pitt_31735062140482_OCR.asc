Hospitalization Revised

To include Air Raids *

Editor’s note:

Following is the ﬁrsl of Ol series
of articles about student lwsp-ita.l-
ization, am, insurance for medical
care which covers everythmg from
‘illness to air mid" 'i'njm*ies. The
story t/oelay discusses tile origin
and benefits of this service.
ay SIDNEY KLEIN

In the last year and a half, the
‘student hospitalization’ service at
Pitt has grown from a small or-
ganization for the beneﬁt of rela-
tively few men and women who live
in fraternity or boarding houses to
a service for the entire student
body.

The service was originally insti-
futed for out-of-town students who

needed immediate hospital care and
did not have the necessary funds,
but the increased” number of local
students who enrolled last semes-
ter is an indication that the whole
student body realizes the bene-
ﬁts of such service.

Hospitalization insurance has

‘saved money. One student paid

$2.50 last October - for a semes-

. ‘bar's insiirance. That very evening
1, has was suddenly taken ill and rush-
ed to the hospital. His insurance

saved him nearly $100.

Because of the -trimester plan,
the $2.50 fee per semester has
been changed to $2.25 per trimes-
ter. This enables the student to
have year-round hospital service.

, The new plan also provides for

Applications for graduation

J

the continuation of the insurance
to the end of May for those seniors
who graduate in April.

Students who withdraw from
school to accept defense jobs will
receive the unexpired part of their
payment.

All injuries, even if caused by
an air-raid or other emergency,
are covered by the insurance.

Students may enroll this week
at the Student Health Service for
Women or the Men’s Student
Health service. The fee should be

aid at the treasurer’s office, 2409
Cathedral, before January 31
when insurance for the last sem-
ester will expire.

The student hospitalization ser-
" vice is sponsored by the Pitt News,
the Student Health Service for
Women under the direction of Dr.
Auleene M. Jamison, and the Men's
Student Health service under the
direction of Dr. H. C. Carlson; it is
made possible by the cooperation
of the Pittsburgh hospitals.

Fine Arts

 

R°°’" ope“ Passes $800 Mark

Tomorrow

Tomorrow evening the “ﬁne arts
lecture room, 324 Cathedral, will be
opened f o 1“ m a l 1 y, completing
months of work made more difficult
by war shortage of materials.

Invitations have been sent-for the
opening ceremony.

The room, “made possible
through the generosity and person-
al interest of Helen C. Frick,” will

. be used for fine arts lectures and
class room _work, according to
Walter R. Hovey, head of the fine
arts department.

The new auditorium will seat
about 170 persons and will be equip-
ped with motion picture and slide
projectors. The projectors will be
installed in a booth at the rear of
the room.

-Although lavish in rich appoint-
ments, it is digniﬁed and reserved
in its Italian Renaissance design,
Mr. Hovey stated. Brown wood-
work contrasts salmon-colored walls
and for more color contrast, Italian
green has been added.

Outstanding in the room are
the genuine ltalian antiques. The
ceiling is an original piece of a
palace near Cremona. Two of the
six wrought-iron lighting fixtures
came from an ltalian’s metal shop
of the “candle period." The lec-
turer’s table and chair are an-
tique imports.

“The glory of the room is its

rection by,Piero della Francesca,”
Prof. Hovey said. Its original can
be found in the Umbrian town of
Borgo San Sepolero. Few of the
masterpieces such as this have ever
,,found their way to America.

Art exhibits from Pitt’s outstand-
ing ﬁne arts departmentare now
being displayed at other colleges
and educational centers, a result of
a special service established re-
cently.

Five exhibits have been
ed for shipping and are
display throughout the United
States. Under this plan exhibits
from other universities will be dis-

‘ played at the University.

UDC Committee
To Assign Posts

Assignment of students and fac-
ulty members of the University to
civilian defense posts will begin
soon, it was announced today.

, Dr. Asher lsaacs, associate pro-
fessor of economics and head‘ of
. the special classroom committee,
said that a staff of volunteer cleri-
cal workers has been at work since
early Thursday sorting the defense
application blanks submitted dur-
ing registration.

Dr. Isaacs added that the com-
mittee would welcome the services
of other students to aid in the sort-
ing and tabulation of the forms.

More than 11,000 separate appli-
cation blanks were ﬁlled out by
students, faculty members, and em-
ployees of the University during
registration.

Dr. Isaac: commended the co-
operation with theucommittee, and
added that this cooperation was an
excellent indicationiof the morale
at Pitt. - - V

The Welter of information gath-
ered through the forms is now be-
ing broken doivn into separate
parts. Any need for personnel or
manpower by other University de-
fense committees, such as the black-
out squad, will be ﬁlled from these
ﬁles.

Defense volunteers have been
warned ..by University officials that

drills will be conducted at frequent.

intervals, but defense committee

members definitely have promised.

that any such drills will be given
adequate publicity through the Pitt
News. ~ _

While the primary purpose of the
committee is to supply the Uni-
versity with defense personnel, it
was pointed out that, in time of
crisis, the abilities of faculty and

Stamp Driveproceeds to be/lppiied  
To United States Battleship iowa 1 A

The United States battleship
Iowa was selected by the Pitt De-
fense Stamp Drive committee as
the object of their campaign to ob-
tain funds for the government dur-
ing the present crisis.

“It is deﬁnitely not the inten-
tion of the committee to subscribe

enough money to pay for the.con-

struction of an entire battleship,

for such a venture would run some-
where around seventy million dol-
lars,” Herbert Gall, M42, chair-
man, stated.

“in brief, the idea of the
plan is to collect as much as pos-
sible, through the purchase of de-
fense stamps, to defray the cost of
a mighty sea vessel." i

The money will besent directly
\ into the treasury just as do _the pro-
ceeds of the sale of any defense
stamps or bonds. The battleship is
merely used as’ a symbol so that
the money collected can be express-
.ed in terms of its relation to the

 

  

cost of a tangible defense project,
according to Gall.

Robert X. Graham, head of the
University News service, has offer-
ed to aid the campaign. He has
231 outlets through which «he can
distribute publicity for the commit-
tee, the Associated press, United
press, and international News ser-
vice included.-

The national publicity commit-
tee of the college defense stamp
drive will work with Mr. Graham,
whose local newspaper connections
will be utilized to build up a strong
drive ill this district.

The goal of the committee is to

‘ reach every one of the 1,699 col-

leges and universities in the Unit-
ed ‘States through a system of chain
communications with a few key
schools in each state. Mr. Graham
has been asked to publicize the
national movement and Gall hopes
that. hundreds of thousands of col-
1eg’e.stud_ents may be reached.

  

"To extract funds for’ the govt,“/.‘i.

ernment from college students ‘_
through the ordinary channels ofjé

bond and stamp sales is a difficult

matter for it involves the average ,-
student’: indifference in such mat-
ters,” Gall said. “Through an indie ‘V

vidual high-pressure campaign in ’

each school, however, it will be

more possible to arouse the patri-‘dc

otic feelings of the student body,
especially when the amount asked
is so small.”

The committee will not depend

on individual sales but on the total 7 A

The mile relay team will be the
only representatives that Pitt will
have in the Millrose games Satur-
day a week. On the basis of the
trials run—oﬂE' last week, the relay
team shapes up with Stickel, Car-
ter, .Peretic, and Smith carrying
the baton for the locals. However,
. Coach Olsop stated that these posi-
tions are not permanent and that
any boy can challenge this quar-
tet’s positions. _

In this combination of baton ex-
changers the Panthers have two
sophomores running, Peretic and
Smith. ‘Both of these boys have
been ﬂashing promising form in
practice sessions and should de-
ivelop\- into crack relay-men with
experience gained in competing
against the ﬁnest stock of runners

In addition to sharing the chores

PiKA'sWin Mark

Forging ahead in the last half
of the Friday night prelim,- Phi
Gamma Delta outlasted Pi Kappa
Alpha 27-22 to takethe lead in the
fraternity basketball league.

Thurbon was high. scorer for the

.Fiji’s with six points. Ralph Wilde »

and Miller topped the PiKA scor-
ers. The PiKA’s made a desperate
drive near the end of the game, but
.fell short of tieing the score.

With the half-way mark in the -

current basketball season having ‘ '

been reached andpassed last Fri-
day", Pitt’s hot and cold basketball
team gets a respite this week. The
next game on the Blue and Gold
schedule is with West Virginia next
Wednesday night "on the Stadium
ﬂoor.

Although the record compiled
by" the Panthers in. the first half
of the schedule is far from impres-
sive, iticould be a lot worse. Also
it is plain to see that the players
have been improving and a fast
ﬁnish is not ‘improbable.

Easily the standout performer this
season, has been Larry Pali‘rath,
co—captai.n o'fthe'team. Dubbed the
“Blond Bomber” by local sports
writers, Paffrath had an'a'vera.ge' of
better than 14 points per game un-
till. last Friday’s contestwith Cali-.
fornia State Teachers when.~.=l_1e
scored only ﬁve. However, he still
is the leading scorer. in the city,
boasting 106 tallies for the eight
games played thus far. . -

Paffrath was hottest against Gen-
eva as he rang up 24 points and
followed this great performance
three nights later with 20‘ more
points against Penn State. '
Another good reason why the sec-

ond half of the season should be
better is Bobby Artman, smallest
of the ﬁve regulars. When the sea-
son opened Artman played a good
ﬂoor game, but his shooting was
very erratic. In the last few games,
however, he hasfound the range,
and against‘California State he was
really eagle-eyed. _

Eddie Ziolkow_ski and Jimmy
Egan have been improving as the
season progressed and will be deﬁ-
nite aids in making a strong ﬁnish
possible this year.

4 However, the player who deserves
more praise than any other is Tay
Malarkey. He is the type of player
whom everybody takes for granted.-
Tay isn’t a high scorer;- he isn’t a

~ spectacular player; but he is a ball-

player’s player.

s

While the headlines and press

notices go to the high point men,‘
the ﬂashy floor stars, it is a player ,

like Malarkey who makes the dif-
ference when the chips are down.
.Mar-larkey is the type of player
who goes along game after game

playing a steady, dependable game

Unsung Hero

but is often overlooked when the

.sportswriters toss their praises

around.

In a 1'ec_e-int game, Malarkey play-
ed under physical handicaps that
would» have incapacitated many.

VTAhat nigh_tf_,he_ "played one of ,the
best ﬂoor ga-mes seen around here
in a long ‘time. Yet, not one of the

.downtown_ ,_'_,w[rite1‘s ’ had anything
about it in",thei1' accounts of the
contest;   _ .

Thus? farj‘th-is- season, the Pan-
thers have played both good and
bad basketball. It was deﬁnitely "a
badnight when the J unglecats blew
a 20-9 lead ‘against Penn State, and
ended up on the short end of 34-30
score. . ' -

The rest of the season will be
better, the players are conﬁ_den_t of
that. And -the improvement shown

. in the last few games bear this out.
The 500 average they have now
should be nearer 700 by the time
the curtain falls next month.

Status of medical students in the
draft was clariﬁed today by Dr.
William S. McEllroy, dean of the
School of Medicine.

In a statement sent to deans of

all the medical schools by General

' Lewis B. Hershey, director of se-

lective service, it was revealed that

both the Army and Navy‘ have

R adopted a policy under which com-

missions may be granted to third

and fourth year medical students

enrolled acceptable medical
schools.

in

 < , When so commissiondd, such
' men will be permitted to complete
their medical training, including
one year on internship, before be-
ing ordered to active duty. .

‘The local boards,” the letter stat-

- ed, “should, therefore, advise all
lihird and fourth year medical stu-
nt‘ dents and ﬁrst year internes who
9 come before them for classiﬁcation
that they may make application
-for commissions in either of the ser-
vices. Registrants so applying
‘should be deferred pursuant to the

 _ provisions of Memorandum to All

State Directors, I-18, pending re-
ceipts of their commissions. ~

M “The classiﬁcation of third and

" fourth year medical students and

i . internes who have been classiﬁed

in Class ll-A and who refuse to

apply for a commission in one of

the services may be reconsidered

by the local board, and such “per-

sons, if nototherwise deferred and

R if found physically qualiﬁed, may
be classiﬁed in Class I—A.

 Third and fourth year medical

, students and internes _who are re-
jected after applying for commis-
sions may be classiﬁed pursuant to

I  the provisions of Memorandum to

Al’! State Directors, I-91.

“First and second year medical
students and those who have been
accepted as students in the .medi-
cal school may be classiﬁed as here-
tofore, pursuant to the provisions
of the Memorandum to All State
Directors, I-91.” ‘

In a bulletin posted in the
School of Medicine, Dean McEllroy
urges third and fourth year medi-
cal students to comply with the
official letter.

The new Panther will be like

Students entering the University
School of Medicine at the next
registration——which is scheduled
for early this summer-—Will com-
plete the four year course in three
years. 0

Dr. William S. McEllroy, Medi-
cal school dean, explained this
week that further details of the
new accelerated program will be
made known after uniform pol-
icies have been established next
month’ at a meeting of the Asso-
ciation of American Medical Col-
leges.

The Association, which includes
as members all class A medical
schools in the United States and
Canada, and of which the Univer-
sity’s school is a member, will meet
February 14 in Chicago.

Among problems which will be
considered are scheduling of the
summer terms and the one year
internships, which willstill be re-
quired. Dean McEllroy indicated
that summer registration for the
University’: school will take place
either in late June or early July.

The’ executive committee of the
association, headed by Dr. Willard
C. Rappley, had been asked by the
United States public health service
to accelerate their medical school
programs,. to eliminate summer
vacations, and "allow the equivalent
two semesters to permit gradua-
tions early as possible.

Dr. Mclillroy warns all students
entering the School of Medicine to
deﬁnitely ascertain their financial
situation ‘and draft status with lo-
cal boards to relieve possible con-
fusion.

70 Men Begin  
First Aid Course

Approximately 70 men students

' gathered Monday in 24 Cathedral‘

to begin the special ﬁrst aid course

offered by the University under the

direction of Captain John Cameron,
medical corps, US army. '

For the ﬁrst twenty minutes of

the class hour, Capt. Cameron ex-

plained the purpose of the course
and its organization. He said that
the purpose would be to provide
men skilled in aiding people who

. have been the victim of accidents‘

caused by bombs, shock, and_ con-
cussions. -

He stressed the fact that the‘ stu-
dents would not be trained to treat
illnesses or to administer anything
but temporary aid before the ar-
rival of. a physician.

To permit demonstrations and to
make them clearer to the students,
the class was divided into squads
of four with a senior medical stu-

- dent as the demonstrator for each
squad.

After the explanation the class
ﬁled down to the Cathedral gym-
nasium where the practical demon-
strations are given. The squads
then were assigned sections of the
gymnasium for their permanent
working space.
