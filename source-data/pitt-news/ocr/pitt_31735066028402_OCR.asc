Prank could land fraternity pledges in jail

Charges pending against three from Zeta Beta Tau

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Pitt Police have issued
arrest warrants for three fra-
ternity pledges who allegedly
stormed through bathrooms
in Tower B taking snapshots
of naked women in the show-
er.
The pledges, from the Zeta
Beta Tau fraternity, will be
charged with criminal con-
spiracy, criminal trespassing
and harassment. Pitt adminis-
trators are also looking into
the case, .and ZBT has been
placed on interim suspen-
sion; an investigation is
forthcoming.

“This is a personal inva-

sion,” said Pitt Police Chief
Rick Boyd. “The victims
were pretty shook up about
the whole incident.”

Boyd said that around 2
p.m. on Sunday the pledges
ran through bathrooms
“armed with Polaroids.”
They ripped open shower
curtains and took pictures of
at least three different Pitt
students who were taking a
shower.

Pitt Police got descriptions
from the victims and stopped
three individuals on Fifth
Avenue and Bigelow
Boulevard. First the students
denied any involvement, but
after they were called in for
questioning, they confessed.

A Polaroid camera was
found in one of the student’s
backpacks, and the pictures
were later recovered and will
be kept as evidence, accord-.
ing to Boyd.

“The victims involved have
indicated that they would like
the individuals prosecuted,”
Boyd said.

Assistant Director of
Student Activities Dennis
Donham said he asked Greek
Adviser Kerry Daley to put
ZBT on suspension until “a
thorough investigation can be
completed.”

Daley could not be reached
for comment.

“The allegations thus far
are very serious,” Donham

said. “We will ask people to.

move quickly on this. We
know who to talk to and all
the relevant parties.”

“The individuals, as well
as the fraternity, can face
sanctions,” Pitt spokesman
Ken Service said. “An inter-
nal investigation is under-
way, and we hope to have it
completed as soon as we can,
hopefully by the end of the

-week.”

lnter—Fraternity Council
President Doug Siege] said
IFC has not made any deci-
sions yet.

"On Friday, this issue will
be resolved [by Pitt] and we
will wait until then to do

“Garbage — Can I help

too inviting of a business

Tom Petty takes special

This 47-year-old for-

simply selling vinyl to
having a store holding
over 60,000 CDS.

Walking into the store

No matter what type of

SGB goes to
Washington
for student aid

By Nicole Walz
Staff Writer

Last Thursday, members of the
Student Government Board trav-
elled to Washington in their contin-
ued efforts to oppose cuts in federal
student aid. They returned to cam-

‘ pus satisfied with the results.

The Kassebaum Amendment to
the Senate Budget Reconciliation
Bill restored $5.9 million to the stu-
dent aid program. This passed with
a 99-0 vote after the Simon-
Kennedy Amendment failed.

The Simon-Kennedy Amendment
would have achieved the following:

°restoring direct lending language
to the current law, allowing choice
and competition to remain between

V both loan programs

°restoring the interest-free six-
month grace period, striking the 85
percent tax charged to institutions
based on student loan volume

°striking the increase in interest
rates on PLUS (parent) loans

The Kassebaum Amendment,
however, restored all of these provi-
sions, except it retained a 20 percent
cap on direct lending programs.

Direct lending allows students to
get loans faster by cutting out the
“middle agencies” of banks, lenders,
and guarantee agencies. It would
also provide more flexible repay-
ment rates and lower interest rates

“I feel direct lending is a fiscally
sound program,” said SGB board
member Keith Campbell. “Direct
lending is in the students’ interest.”

Campbell considers this to be a
victory for students, but in coming
weeks there are still more decisions
to be made.

“We will be pressuring President

Clinton to veto the bill." said
Campbell. The U.S. House of

Quebec will remain Canadian providence

MONTREAL — Quebec’s
referendum to secede from
Canada lost 50.6 percent to
49.4 percent, leaving seces-

‘margin that could have grant-

It is such a narrow margin
that it could leave the country

Thousands cheered and waved

MOSCOW — The parlia-

Russia is in disarray due to a
ban on two prominent parties
and President Boris Yeltsin
being cut off from his top
advisors for the fifth consecu-

Yeltsin has been hospital-
ized for heart trouble since
Thursday and has yet to hand
power over to Prime Minister
Chernomyrdin. His doctors
have continued to forbid him
meeting with his officials due
to the stress.

In his absence, the election

‘RENO, Nev. — A Nevada

jury ordered Dow Chemical
Co. on Monday to award $10
million in punitive damages
for faulty breast implants
made by Dow Corning C0,, a
50-50 joint venture of Dow
Chemical and Coming Inc.

The award is on top of the
compensatory damages of
$4.1 million the company was
ordered to pay the plaintiff,
Charlotte Mahlum, and her
husband.

The case was the first
instance in which Dow
Chemical was named the lone
defendant. The plaintiff
argued that Dow Chemical
should be forced to pay the
damages even if Dow Corning
does not pay due to its filing

Dow Corning is the leading
maker of silicone breast
implants, and it filed for bank-

Paradigm Perverts

Well, well, well. It would seem that the good brothers of the Zeta
Beta Tau fraternity have taken time out of their busy philanthropic
schedules to include a little bit of model behavior in their daily routines.
Yes, those good brothers and new members of ZBT are true paragons
of upstanding citizenship, and their recent actions have proven that one
more time.

In case you haven’t heard about last week’s escapades, Tower B was
the site of ZBT’s good deed for the week. It would seem that some of
the fraternity’s members got the bright idea to run through the women’s
ﬂoors of the building with a Polaroid camera, pulling back shower cur-
tains and snapping quick shots of whoever might have been fortunate
' enough to be posing at the time.

Before anyone gets mad, yes, this is sarcasm. The associates of ZBT
have proven, with this asinine stunt, that they are members of the low-
est form of life on the planet, right below arnoebas on the evolutionary
scale. They are living, breathing proof that some peoplehave no con-
cept of decency, propriety or respect.

This kind of incident cannot be passed off as a college prank A

prank is something people, including the victim of the prank, can even-
‘ tually look back on and laugh about A prank is something that doesn’t
actually hurt anyone, physically or emotionally. This stunt by the mem-
' bers of ZBT was not a prank Rick Boyd, Pitt Police chief, said it per-
fectly: “This goes too far. This goes beyond acting like an idiot.”
9 The women who were unsuspectingly caught in the shower and cap-
‘ tured on ﬁlm were, to use a risky tenn, violated. Their sense of privacy,
security and decency were violated. No one should be afraid to. take a
shower in the building in which they live (especially not in one that is
supposed to be off limits to anyone who doesn’t live there and isn’t
speciﬁcally invited as a guest of a resident).

Fortrmately, Pitt Police did manage to identify three of the perverts
who were involved in this little stunt, and they were able to recover and
the photographs, which now will be used as evidence. So at least the
women who were violated can sleep without wonying about their pic-
tures being eyed by 60-some fratemity brothers.

But now comes the question of what should be done. This stunt,

without a doubt, requires punishment The men who took the pictures
will be charged with criminal trespass, harassment and criminal con-
spiracy. They should also be expelled from school. The men who did
this were pledges of ZBT, and the stunt was apparently caused by pres-
sure from brothers of the ﬁatemity. If so, those who were behind the
scenes should be punished just as much as those who actually took the
5,’ pictures.
 ,‘ It is time to take some action against the growing problem of fraterni-
 ty “pranks” turning criminal. The university needs to use this incident
 as a springboard to prove that this kind of behavior will no longer be
tolerated or swept under the rug. ZBT should be used as an example —
their chapter should be kicked off of Pitt’s campus,‘ and their charter
should be revoked. Until this kind of example is set, fraternities will
continue to pull stupid stunts which put people at risk, both physically
and mentally. So long, ZBT!

Wt the government says

 
   
   
   

i b e r a l s
don’t see
anything

appen unless
they see govem-
ent do it.”
his is a quote

~ rom Dick

Armey, the

Matt majority leader
Mills of the House of

Representatives.
It sums up the ridiculous growth
of government since the New
Deal. In case you haven’t taken
the time to analyze our govem-
ment’s ideas, I will take this
opportunity to interpret some of
the messages our govemment is
telling us.

You are too stupid to save
money. This is the premise
behind social security. Even if
the system worked as it was
designed, why shouldn’t we pre-
pare for retirement the way we
choose? It is no secret that, as it
is now, retired people only
receive a fraction of what they
have paid into the system. So
why not just give people guide-
lines concerning what they
should save for retirement, and
then let them do it? Besides,
money invested in the private
sector tends to make more
money, while money invested in
more government tends to disap-
pear.

Farmers, you are too stupid to
understand how a market works.
The U.S. Department of
Agriculture pays enormous sub-
sidies to American farmers and
directs the market as if we had a
planned economy. The bureau-
crats keep prices too high and
then pay farmers to produce
more than the artificial prices
dictate. Then, as the government
sees the product go to waste, it
has to ﬁnd ways to dispose of it.
As a result, the USDA then pays
farmers to idle land, which
amounts to an area the size of
Indiana, Ohio and half of Illinois
combined. Don’t feel stupid if
you can’t follow this logic. It
says here that farmers aren’t as

stupid as Woody Boyd would
have you believe. If the USDA
would just leave farmers alone,
everyone would be better off.
Consumers would not have to
pay for subsidies and could dic-
tate lower prices, the government
could lower taxes (in theory) and
farmers would use their previ-
ously unused lands to raise pro-
duction and exports.

You don ’t know how to run
public schooling. Theoretically,
we should be able to provide the
best public education inthe
world, and we certainly have the
money to pay for it. However, as
spending has increased, educa-
tion has gotten worse. Public
school spending in real terms has
quadrupled since 1950, rising to
$6,500 per student, compared to
just $4,100 per student in private
schools. But since 1960, SAT
scores have declined 73 points.
As we spend more and more, we
get dumber and dumber. So let’s
get rid of the group of commu-
nists known as the Department of
Education, provide for a system
of school choice and thus force
public schools to improve.

You are a bunch of racists. It
says here that white people aren’t
inherently racists. I recall hearing
Ice-T, the consummate social
philosopher, once say that if a
black boy and a white boy grew
up playing in the same sandbox,
they would never even notice
racial differences. So at some
point, society cultivates segrega-
tion and racial strife. This is
where the government comes in
to play. If we continue to focus
on race in the form of ‘quotas,
affirmative action, “cultural
diversity love-fests” and the like,
we will never be “color-blind.”
We’ve tried it the govemment’s
way, and racial tension is as bad
now as it has been in 30 years.
The government should take the
ﬁrst step toward color—blindness
by outlawing any mention of
race by any institution receiving
public funding. This means that
if we applied that to the
University of Pittsburgh, for

instance, they wouldn’t demand
to know what race we are. Why
should it matter? This would be
the best road to real racial inte-
gration. Of course, we would all
miss the Black Action Society
greatly, but I think life would go
on.

You don ’I want your own
health care, so we will force it on
you. President Clinton argued
that since health care is expen-
sive, we should just make it free.
It is expensive, but the answer is

I not more government, but less

government. In 1943, the IRS
decided that health insurance did
not have to be declared as
income. It sounds like a good
idea, just as Marxism sounds
good in theory, but it doesn’t
work. Because health insurance
is tax—deductib1e for employers,
it makes sense for them to pro-
vide it instead of more income.
Employees, in turn, don’t care
what they spend on health care or
what it costs. This allows doctors
to raise their rates. As a result,
self-employed and non-insured
workers rightfully complain
about the high prices of health
care. Insured employees become
afraid of leaving their jobs,
because they fear losing their
health care benefits. Again, a
well-intended government pro-
gram causes great trouble. If the
IRS would treat health care
insurance as normal income, then
workers would simply receive
cash. They would demand lower
prices for health care, since they
would all pay out-of-pocket.
Thus, health care would become
more reasonable without govem-
ment intervention.

Fortunately, the voters are
starting to wake up and realize
the downfalls of big government.
After next year’s elections. the
people will finally be on the way
to a release from the burdens of
excessive govemment interven-
tion.

nobodyk
liner

t was al-
most im-
possible,

but I think I
did it. I
thought of
s o m e t hi n g
p o s i t i v e
about the Pitt
f o o t b a l 1
‘team.

In a year like
the one the Panthers have had,
that’s no easy thing to do. Seven
straight losses. A shutout at the
hands of 2-5 Boston College. A
whipping from Ohio State. And
who could forget Temple grab-
bing its ﬁrst ever win in the Big
East. ‘

But there is something good to
think about involving Pitt foot-
ball, and in 11 days, when the
Panthers play their last home
game, it will all be over.

Dietrich Jells and Tom
Tumulty. The most explosive
offensive weapon this team has
seen in ﬁve years, and the most
dominant linebacker since Hugh
Green led the No. 1 Panthers in
1979.

Jells and Tumulty arrived in
1991 from Erie and Penn Hills,
respectively. The upcoming years
were full of promise for both
players.

But after starting off 5-0, the
Panthers dropped six of their last
seven that season. Since then,
they’ve won just 11 of 43 games.

But throughout it all Jells and
Tumulty have given everything
they had to this football team.

Jells will leave as Pitt’s all-time
leading receiver. No. 26 has made
some great catches, like the 91-
yard score against Rutgers in
1992.

Tumulty will leave his mark,
one of hustle and determination,
on the defense. He has fought off
many injuries, including a serious
chest injury _in 1992, to move into
Pitt’s top 10 tackles list.

Jells and Tumulty thought this
KXCHI would be different In train-
 camp the buzzwords were
“six wins” and “bowl game.”
Neither has happened, but these
two Panthers kept on going.

 Panthers are not going to win.

Most likely, they will get crushed.

But when you are getting ready
to leave at the beginning of the

stop.

Think about Dietrich Jells and
Tom Tumulty, two of the best-
ever Pitt Panthers playing in their
last home game. Cheer for them,

Crew wins Ilu-ee gold medals

By Nichole Gantshar
Stqﬁ Writer

Three gold medals accompa-
nied Pitt crew home from the Jack
Speakmon Regatta in Columbus,
Ohio, this past weekend. Pitt crew
joined approximately 25 schools
to test the varsity team. The ﬁrst
place ﬁnishes proved a dramatic
comeback for a team that last year
lost 75 percent of its boats in a
trailer accident.

“We’ve overcome many difﬁ-
culties and shortcomings,” men’s
varsity coach Todd Ridenour said

The boat damage “resulted in
lost water time,” Ridenour said,
and the wins demonstrated to the
crew, “It’s worth all the training
they have put into it.”

Before the Speakmon Regatta,
the crews, “hadn’t actually raced
and won recent races since the
accident,” Ridenour said. “This
race proved to them that they are
still competitive.”

The crew club also witnessed
the debut of the novice women’s
boats. The novice women had a
commendable showing with the
novice women’s eight boat A ﬁn-
ishing 12th out of 25. Novice
women’s eight boat B finished
17th out of 25 entries. A
respectable ﬁnish from the novice
women’s four reinforced the
novice team’s elforts.

They were not joined by novice
men’s victories, because the men’s
team stayed home to prepare for
the club’s next match.

Pitt took four vans of rowers to
compete in the regatta where
schools from throughout Ohio and
Michigan met to race. Carnegie
Mellon and Mercyhurst joined
several high school competitors
along with Pitt to represent
Pennsylvania at the competition.

Men’s varsity four finished
sixth out of 16 entries.

The men’s varsity eight “rowed
better than they ever had.”

Ridenour said. “Their perfor-
mance is the best I’ve seen to
date.”

Varsity men’s eight finished
llth out of 20 entries, despite the
fact that one of their rowers had a
collision with a duck.

“Usually the ducks get out of
the way,” club president Julie
Lambrou said.

The large groups of migrating
ducks only compounded the prob-
lems caused by a cold, windy and
rainy day-

Despite the problems, “the
water was remarkably calm,” said
Suzarmah Land, club vice presi-
dent.

The club was especially proud
of the varsity men’s lightweight
eight that finished first out of
seven entries, beating teams from
Ohio State and Michigan.

These schools host champi-
onship teams and have had their
clubs longer than Pitt. Varsity
men’s four also placed ﬁrst. The

at  M

_ "»“~»§- _m.., w .

last gold medal winner, women’s
varsity four, ﬁnished 1:14 ahead
of the second-place ﬁnisher.

Women’s lightweight four boat
A ﬁnished ninth, and boat B ﬁn-
ished eighth. “We had a good
start, but towards the end it was
like rowing through the mud,”
boat A member Lambrou said.

The teams competed in front of
a small crowd of local Ohio par-
ents and other team members. The
regattas often don’t garner large
crowds because “it’s difﬁcult to
watch head races,” Land said.
“The boats start every 10 sec-
onds,” making it difﬁcult to tell
which boat is winning.

The strong placements of each
boat gave the club “a positive out-
look for the next race,” and shows
“they know they can beat other
crews,” Ridenour said. '

Pitt crew travels to Virginia for
its next race, The Head of the
Occoquan, which will take place
on Saturday.

Anderson II1 I1
ups and d;UVIV1|?|S fiii'U)%C

By Geoff Moak
Staﬂ Writer

The idea of a story about
sophomore runner Stacey
Anderson confused Pitt cross
country coach-Dave Sobal at
ﬁrst. He wasn’t sure what to say
about Anderson, but there never
seems to be a dull moment for
Sobal when dealing with her.

“Sometimes she’s quiet, and
other times she’s vocal,” Sobal
said. “That’s characteristic of
where she’s been athletically,
too. She’s been up and down.”

The literal ups and downs of
hill running have posed prob-
lems for Anderson this season.
A nagging case of tendonitis in
her feet has made it difﬁcult to
run on the hills and poor footing
that characterizes many cross
country courses. Because of her
injury, many of Anderson’s
“ups” this season have come on
relatively flat courses. The
injury also has made Anderson
appreciate track more.

“In high school I loved cross
country, but now I’m starting to
like track more,” Anderson said.
“Two miles was the longest dis-

tance we ran on the track in
high school, but I’d like to try a
10,000 [meters] on the track.”
That’s a somewhat odd atti-
tude considering Anderson’s
high school running career. She
never qualified for states in
track. The qualifying time was
11:35 for two miles; Anderson’s
best time was 11:36. In cross
country, she ran at states, not
once but twice, ﬁnishing in 18th
place in both her junior and
senior years. She helped propel
her team from Greensburg
Salem High School to the state
championship in her senior year.
“I was the only senior on the
team that year,” Anderson said.

* “The coach said I had a lot to do

with it, but it was really a team
effort.”

Anderson got her start in run-
ning almost by accident. She
nearly became a basketball
player instead.

“My uncle_wanted me to try
basketball,” Anderson said. “I
played intramural basketball,
andvone of the phys ed teachers
said I had talent. But I was just

too short.”

Internet opens the
door for sports fans

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

Editor’s Note: This is the ﬁrst ofa two-part series about sports on

the internet.

When there was no such thing as television, sports fans would
crowd around a radio and listen to a ball game. Television put an
end to fans having to picture in their minds of what actually hap-
pened and opened up an entirely new perspective for fans. Sports
enthusiasts could now watch a sporting event as it happened.

Now there is a third wave of technology that has sports fans sali-
vating at its possibilities. What was originally designed as a com-
munication network for the defense department is now a harvest of
millions of pieces of information and is growing at a rate of 25 per-

cent per month.
- Welcome to the Internet.

“The Internet is estimated to be a trillion dollar industry by the
year 2000,” estimates Thomas & Poorbaugh and Associates, a local

Internet consulting ﬁrm.

Why would such a high-tech and computer—re1ated industry be
considered manna from heaven to sports enthusiasts?

The possibilities are endless, and you can see for yourself simply
by sampling a few Internet locations, or “sites,’-’ as they are affec-

tionately called.

First of all, there are some rules (not many at this time) to be
heeded when searching on the Internet, or “surfing the Net” as it is
nicknamed, especially when accessing the Net through your stu-

dent computer service account.

It is not recommended by Pitt’s Computer Information Services
Department to search the Net during peak hours. because doing so
can jam up the lines, as well as take up room for other students who

need to do what is considered by

the school to be more important
things. The best time to search

I I I the Net is early in the morning

or late at night.

Also, it is recommended only
to surf the Net when it can be
related to class work. But the Pitt
computer service department
does not want students to feel
they should avoid the Internet if
they are not taking Internet
classes.

“Searching the Net is how you
learn, so We’re not saying not to
go on the Net. We’re just saying
not to abuse your privileges,”
said a CIS official. “After all,
each student is assessed a com-
puter fee along with his or her
tuition each term, so each stu-
dent deserves computer access.”

For students who want to “use
their privileges and explore the
Net,” a quick lesson needs to be
taught.

First of all, for those of you
who do not know the ﬁrst thing
about computers and the Net, do
not be afraid. Simply go to a
computer lab and start exploring.

If you do not have a CIS
account, you should open one by
going to a lab and applying for
one. It takes about 24 hours to
open an account. Then you can
get started immediately, so grab
your surfboards and dive right
in.

You can search the Internet in
a variety of ways, but since this
is not a lesson in Internet tech-
niques, just take for granted that
Netscape is the best vehicle to
search with at this time. Also, it
is slightly easier to search on a
Macintosh than a DOS.-based
computer, so ﬁnd a lab that has
Macs.

Open up the folder that con-
tains Intemet tools, and you will
find Netscape inside. Open up
this connection, and you are on
your way to being swept away.
Just consider the Net as a collec-
tion of department stores on the
computer, and you are on a
shopping trip. In order to visit
each “store,” you must first

 
  

American

First A’
Red

know the address.

Ask your friends, classmates
anditeachers if they know any
good sports—related Internet
sites, and then look them up to
see if they serve your purposes.

Another useful tactic in col-
lecting Internet sites is to find
them in magazines or on televi-
sion and write them down.

For super-Net enthusiasts,
keeping a directory of Internet
sites similar to a regular tele-
phone directory is not uncom—
mon. There are even reference
guides such as anlnternet yel-
low pages that are useful when
looking for sites to visit.

To familiarize yourself with
the Net, a good place to start is
Pitt’s own Internet site.

Whenever you open up
Netscape, your computer should
automatically take you to Pitt’s
site. If that does not happen,
simply type in the go to window
at the top of the screen the fol-
lowing: http://www.pitt.edu/.

You will see the Cathedral of
Learning in the background and
several ovals down the left side
of the page. Click on the bottom
oval which reads, “Alumni.
Public Service and Athletics.”

Once you do that, another
series of ovals will appear in the
foreground of some Pitt clothing
paraphernalia. Click on the oval
that reads “Varsity Athletics.”

You will now be greeted by a
huge picture of the Pitt Panther’s
head with the following greet-
ing: “Welcome to the University
of Pittsburgh’s Sports
Homepage.”

From here, you can scroll
down and click on various ath-
letic department areas and find
general information regarding
sports at Pitt.

Beware, however, because
some of the sites within Pitt’s
sports homepage may be incom-
plete or under construction, but
touting this area is an excellent
way to familiarize yourself with
the Web and its possibilities.

Tomorrow we will review
some favorite sites and how to
get to them.

Anderson

‘From page 7
Running was Anderson’s
next shot at a high school sport.
“We ran a mile time trial in
my phys ed class in my fresh-

man year of high school. That .

was the first mile I ever ran,
and I did a 6:35. After that, the
cross country coach kind of
recruited me,” she said. “I start-
ed cross country as a sopho-
more, but I ran track my fresh-
man year. I liked running, and I
just found my niche.”

Pitt was a natural college
choice for Anderson. Pitt’s
location, only about 30 minutes
away from Greensburg, her
hometown, was the main
attraction. She didn’t want to
repeat mistakes that she’d Seen
before.

“My brother went away to
Wichita [Kansas}, and that just
didn’t work out,” Anderson
said. “I wanted to stay close to
home. And the scholarship
helped.”

Anderson is unenthusiastical- ‘

ly majoring in biology. She
wasn’t very happy to admit that
and was quick to add she is
considering changing her major
to nursing.

“I was originally thinking
about pre-med, but I don’t want
to be here any more than I have
to,” Anderson said.

That is not an attitude that
Anderson brings to her run-
ning. According to Sobal, she
almost works’ too hard.

“She’s the hardest worker on .

the team,” Sobal said.
“Sometimes I wonder if that’s
not to her detriment. It’s a chal-
lenge to balance her training
load and intensity so she can
train hard but pain-free.”

That balance sometimes
includes workouts in the pool,
an idea that does not appeal to
Anderson.

“I don’t like the pool.”
Anderson said. “I feel like I
have to work harder to get the
same effect as running.”

Anderson’s times have been .

steadily improving. Despite a
somewhat inconsistent season,
she has made improvements
since last year.

“She did a lot of work over
the summer, and that showed at
the beginning of the year,”
Sobal said. “Others have
caught up some, but she’s con-
tinued to improve.” '

There’s still more room for
improvement. Anderson’s ﬁn-
ish- at the Big East champi-
onships was disappointing to
Sobal. »

“She could’ve been in the top —

25. She has that potential,”
Sobal said. “She’s still learn-
ing. It’s been my experience
that it may take a few years for
a runner to get things worked
out and to run at their maxi-
mum potential.”
Anderson also sees herself
improving and also recognizes
_ that she can keep improving.
She would like to continue to
see improvement after her col-
‘ lege career is over.
“My times are getting bet-
ter,” Anderson said. “I’d like to
see how far I can go.”
