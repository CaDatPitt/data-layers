Men’s Fraternities To Open
Membership Campaign

“No member or members,
pledge or pledges, of a. frater-
mty, directly or indirectly,
shall approach on fraternity
matters, invite to fraternity
premises or entertain in any
way whatsoever any newly-reg-
istered students prior to Wed-
nesday, March 25, 1.931.”—UmI-
versity of Pittsburgh Rushing
Rules for Men’s Fraternities.

For nearly two months this rule
has inﬂuenced the relations of fra-
ternity men toward mid-year fresh-
men. But at 8:30 o’clock Wednes-
day morning, it will be discarded,
and that hectic period known as the
“rushing season” will commence.

Social Deluge

For four days the 118 freshmen
will be deluged with dances, smokers,
theater parties and other occasions
calculated to inﬂuence their ﬁnal
choice, but at the end of that time,
at 2 o’clock Sunday morning, it will
come to an end, and the silence or
bidding period will begin.

The rushing rules forbid any fra-
ternity to hold more than two rush-
ing affairs, and prohibit any rushee
from remaining overnight at a fra-
ternity house or at the home of a
fraternity member.

During the period of silence the
rushing rules forbid any fraternity
member to talk to any newly-regis-
tered student.

At any time during the, silence
period, before 9:30 o’clock Monday
morning, March 30, the fraternities
shall submit their sealed bids to the
office of the dean of men, after
which the dean of men will issue
these invitations.

At the conclusion of this period of
silence, the dean of men’s office will
transmit to the fraternities the ac-
ceptances and refusals received
from their rushees.

“12-12” Again

Although any male student in the
University is eligible for pledging
only those pledges who have earned
their twelve credits
quality points shall be eligible for
initiation. All those pledges not
meeting these requirements during
the ﬁrst semester following their
pledging must relinquish their
pledgeships and will be ineligible for
further pledging until they have
earned their “twelve-twelve” during
the semester immediately preceding
their pledging.

neering who have completed the
full summer term work with‘passing
grades and with a quality point
total for the summer term equaled
"seventy-ﬁve per cent of the work

It a symptom of an ailment that
goes deeper. If a symptom, what
then is the deeper ailment?” The
subject will be discussed by four of

Men To Sing.  
Next Friday

Radio Singer Added To

Annual Program

 

The Men’s Glee Club Home Con-
cert will be presented at Carnegie
Music Hall at 8:30, March 27. A
program, varied in scope and rang-
ing from ancient chorales to Bur-
leigh’s and Logan’s modern love

songs, is expected to please the larg-
est audience to which the Glee Club
has yet sung.

The success of last year’s con-
certs, and appreciation with which
they were met by the musical critics
who reviewed them, appears in fair
way to be duplicated by the club,
which is this year even larger and
more integrated than last ye-ar. Dr.
W. H. Wright, director of the organ-
ization, is well pleased with the de-
velopment of the club, and prom-
ises a concert which will engage the
favorable attention of music lovers
hereabouts.

One of the features of this year’s
program will be the singing of Mar-
tha Eaton Brickman, well-known ra-
dio singer, who will sing a solo group
of Russian numbers and “Le Nil”,
by Leroux. The last number of the
concert, “O Triumph, All Ye Ran-
somed,” from Beethoven’s Oratorio
“The Mount of Olives,” will ﬁnd
Miss Brickman singing the obligate
to a setting of male voices.
Shakespeare ﬁgures prominently
in this year’s concert, the lyrics to
two of the songs having been writ-
ten by him. “Hey Robin,” with the
musical setting by Geoffrey Shaw,
promises to be particularly interest-
ing to the laygaudience, as will the
Handl chorale, “Alleluia," to the
critic group. Vaughan William's

Joint Committee Of Men
And .Women Under New Plan

One year and four weeks after the proposal for the estab-
lishment of -a Men’s Self-Governing Association was ﬁrst made , 
in a Student Council meeting, the proposed constitution for this i
new organization will be submitted to_ a student referendum,

_ It was at a Council meeting on March 5, 1930, that Naomi
Ericson, Ed. ’31, still a member of the governing body,
serted, “Student Council is a wom—out tradition and the pres-
ent system of government permits but little co-operation be-
tween the student body and its representatives on Council.”

This rather. pungent statement of Miss Ericson precipi-

Revise Constitution
Coming back to school this fall, a
committee, headed by Emanuel Fis_h- .
kin, Bus. Ad. ’31, was appointed to
continue the work of composing the
constitution, but shortly afterward-~
this group decided that there was
no use in attempting to erect a per-
manent organization on a faulty, ,0
foundation, so the original consti-~'
tution was abandoned and a new‘: .
organic law was 1- begun. Several? 
meetings were held at which repre- ‘ _
sentative students from men’s a.c- 
tivities contributed suggestions, _
many of which have been incor-‘ 
porated in the ‘revamped constitu- ”
tion which goes to the polls a week
from next Monday. -' _ ‘
The movement for an M. S. G. A. .i
organization may be directly traced
back to a series of altepcations be-
tween Council and Norman Park, 0
Col. ’30, editor of the Pitt Weekly, ~
last year. Park aroused Council's--‘
ire when he published a number of
editorial bombshells charging the
governing body with failure to act
on needed campus legislation. Park '
was hauled before Council and
asked to set forth speciﬁc instances 7
of negligence, while the law-makers
began an investigation into his
charges. .
This action caused a split in the.
ranks of the student legislators and‘
before long several members agreed
that Mr. Park may have been cor-
rect in his assertions and they, in, .
turn, began to pick ﬂaws in their‘ '
own organization. The belief that '

For the past‘ two . weeks two
steamshovels have been engaged in
deepening and lengthening site on

bedrock, and now serve. only to load
the heavy trucks that crawl in and
out of the deep, elongated pit, cart-
ing away the rock that has been
loosened by compressed air drills.

At the center, the excavation has
reached back twenty-nine feet to
remove one corner of the old Por-

from Fifth avenue, next to the Clin-

‘Social Sciences W i I I
Make CenturyFamous’

“The nineteenth century became
famous for the great things that it
has done in science, invention and
industry. The twentieth century
will become even more famous for
the development of the social sci-
ences. The Columbia Conserve
Company is a new experiment, and
a difﬁcult one because there were
no experts and no textbooks to
guide us.”

» Jack Evans, personnel director of
the Columbia Conserve Company,
told members of the Tuesday Fresh-
man club at their regular meeting
in the Activities building last week.
“An Experiment in Modern Indus-
try]: was the subject of Mr. Evans’.

Mr. Evans said that the worst
fears of the skeptics have been
proved false by the continued suc-
cess of the experiment. He said
that he considered the experiment of
great importance to the social and
economic wellbeing of the United
States. He stressed the point that
a democracy doesn’t mean- a thing
until it treats every individual of
the democracy alike.

Bogart Talks
On War Debts

Economics Authority Talks to
Social Science Groups

Prof. E. L. Bogart, president of
the American Economics Associa-
tion and head of the department of
economics at the University of Illi-
nois, spoke at the University on two
occasions Friday.

Addressing the social science
seminar at 11:30 o’clock, he spoke

-on the subject, “International Debts

in the World Economy.” He was
introduced by Dr. iM.arion McKay,
head of the department of eco-
nomics. ’ .

In his speech, Dr. Bogart painted
an optimistic picture of the interna-
tional debt situation. Stating that
today nations have relatively light
foreign debts, iniproportion to their
ability to pay. the speaker held that

.the United States could alleviate

many strained ﬁnancial situations
which do exist, -by extending loans
in times of stress.

“Manners One Hundred Years
Ago” was the subject of Dr. Bo-
gart’s ,address in the afternoon to
an assembly of members of the fac-
ulty and students specializing in so-
cial science studies. Substantiating
his contentions‘by means of ample
illustrations drawn from the writ-
ings of a century ago, the distin-
guished visitor maintained that
many of the social characteristics
of a. hundred years ago are in evi-
dence today.

Following Dr. Bogart’s talk, S. K.
Ratcliff, the well-known English lec-
turer" and journalist, made some in-
teresting observations on the war
debt situation, concluding with the
allegation that the younger genera-
tion looks with dlsfavor on their ul-
tiinate payment.

to them goes the honor of being

as yet, there are no buttons to

many of the students have re-

Now, merely whistling may

will be moved to the campus near
the intersection of University Drive
and Center ‘avenue, and excavation
will be started for the new Fannie

. Dr. Petty Addresses

Y.W.C.A. Mon. Meet

Dr. C. Wallace Petty, of the First.
Baptist Church, will be the speaker
at the 12:30 meeting of Y. W. C. A.,
Monday, March 23. He will use as
the topic of his address, “The Mean-
ing of Easter.”

This meeting with Dr. Petty has
been arranged to help the women in
facing the Easter season with some
idea of the real meaning and pur-
pose of Easter. From questions
asked by the women, it was realized
by the committee that a discussion
of this topic would receive a ﬁne re-
sponse.

Dr. Petty has addressed the stu-
dents many times, both on and off
the campus and his understanding
and interest in student problems is

 

zoology departments.

Friday eve-
ning he is scheduled to address the
Educational Clinic. comP°S€d 0f ‘’3:'
rious deans and teachers of the_V1-
cinity. At the seminar his subject
will be “Stepping Back _Into Stone
Age Society.” His evening topic is
“Primitive Education.” _ ,

As an explorer, next Friday-s as-
sembly speaker has made valuable
contributions as to the nature of the
Far ‘North. Discovery of islands and
a river as large as the Hudson and
of the shallowness of the Polar Sea
have been reported by him. His ex-
peditions to the North have ex-
tended over more than twenty-one
years. Two of these lasted, over four
years each. One, lasting 53 months,
was spent among primitive Eskimos
whose culture still resembled. that of
the Stone Ave. This excursion cov-
ered from 1908 to 1912. Another
lengthy trip, from 1913 to 1918, in-
volved the exploration of over.100,-
000 square miles of Arctic territory.
Twenty thousand miles were trav-
eled by crude dog sleds then.

Steiansson and four others spent
eight months on a huge ice ﬂoe while
on this trip. Important explorations
of Wrangel Island, off the coast of

Siberia in 1923 and another to the

Spring Comes

With the spring tra-la and with
all the little robins and butterﬂies
tomorrow comes the innate feeling
to spread one’s self under the trees
in back of Alumni Hall and harken
to the voice of spring. . . .and the
factory whistles. Tomorrow is
spring. . . .Maybe. That is, according
to Dionysius Exiguus back in 532
A. D.

What we started out to say was,‘
that tomorrow is spring. Yes, beau-
tiful spring. And, according , to
Fr shman English, spring is a “con-
no’ ation.” Some people say it’s
rainy, but still, it’s a “connotation.”
It connotes a great many things.
Flowers'in spring, apple blossoms,
strawberry short cake, and Easter
vacation. In the spring the birds
sing (they tell us) and the sap runs,
yes the sap runs, to his locker for
his running trunks-or baseball suit
to hie out to the ﬁelds and pursue
“nature.” While, or whilst, we poor
students study while the sun makes
hay or a stitch in nine saves two‘
in the bush.

Spring starts on March 21 and
ends when college students are tired
writing love sonnets and madrigals
to. the fair maiden. Here we see
soulful-eyed poets scanning iambic
pentameters while the Cap and
Gown “ladies” trip it. lightly on the
Activities Hut ﬂoor.
be_dotted with dandelions, and vio-
lets. . . .and discarded mid-term test
papers. Everywhere one looks he
sees the vestiges of winter and the
calamities of spring.

Seranades

Fair senoritas will sit on their
“balconies” (second-story windows)
of sorority houses and listen to their
college caballeros strum away on a
borrowed guitar or a three-stringed
mandolin. Yes, romance is in the
air, and if you get near the cafe-
teria you're liable to smell Mulligan
Stew. The gallant cabellero would
be’ a great gag if he didn’t have to

face reality the next day when the

apparent. glamor of spring is gone and he

Describing his discoveries and ex-
periences in the North, Stefansson
has written several books. Among
these are: “My Life With the Eski-
mo,” “The Friendly Arctic,” and
“The Adventure of Wrangelolsland.”

Another of his books established
him as a humorist deserving recog-
nition. “The Standardization _,of Er-
ror,” published in 1927, has been re-
viewed as equal to anything Mark
Twain ever turned out. _ Since 1924
he has spent some of his time as a
traveling lecturer.

He has also been engaged as. a
lecturer at Tufts College and as an
associate in anthropology at_ Har-
vard. Contributions to scientiﬁc
journals have been made at the same
time.

Mr. Stefansson’s note as a linguist

comes from his knowledge, since in-
fancy, of the language of Iceland,
the home of his parents. While at

A.B. degree from Iowa in 1903, as
well as an honorary LL.D. there.
Michigan likewise has honored him
with an LL.D.

Continuous life in direct contact
with Eskimos has given him com-
mand of their language, containing a
vocabulary of more than 12,000
words. Stefansson describes it as a
language “more highly inflected than
the Greek.” '

Various honors bestowed upon him

-include a gold medal from geo-

graphical societies in New York,
Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington,
Paris, Berlin and London. For his
explorations from 1913 to 1918 he
received a vote of thanks from the
Canadian government. Honorary

also been given him.

Third Faculty
Dinner Today

Dean Sieg Honors English,
Journalism Departments

 

 

The third of a series of’ formal
dinners tendered to the faculty mem-
bers of the various departments will
take place tonight when Dr. Lee P.
Sieg, dean of the College, will be
host", to the English and journalism
departments at the University Club.

“These dinners,” said Dean Sieg,
“are an innovation. They are given
for ‘the purpose of bringing the
members of the department together.
We do not have any set program.
No one gives a speech; we, do not
evenplay anagrams or charades. We

just sit around and talk.”

Dinners for the chemistry and
physics departments were given dur-
mg the past week. Attendance of
one hundred per cent was reported.
All 43 members of the English and
journalism departments are ex-
pected.

this was _a novelty to him. A stu-

The excuse was presented by
Charles. Z. Keim, graduate stu-
dent in Greek,; who commute: to
his classes here every week by
aeroplane from his home in

. Wheeling. Leaving a New England
winter resort »after a week-end
for a late afternoon class, Mr.
Keim met the difficulties men'-
tioned.

While he comes to the University
and spends lﬁurs poring over
tomes of - Herodotus and Thucy-
dides. Mr. Keim stores his plane
at Bettis Field. There it is cared
for by his pilot, George Haldeman,
the aviator who piloted Ruth El-
der in her famous transatlantic
t!.i;._'.t a few years ago.

Mr. Keim has nothfng to say
about the future of aviation, for
which we should be duly’ thank-
ful, but he did note that the aero-
plane might be expected to do its
share in further muddling up Uni-

versity sched es, when commu-

To the Editor of The Pitt Weekly:

Let the sincerity of my interest
temper the over-zealousness of what
may appear a‘ somewhat acid com-
mentary. That The Pitt Weekly is a
college, not a commercial, publication
is so obvious as to make proof a
source of embarrassment.

What Every,Student Knows is that
the price of The Weekly is generous-
ly included in his tuition fee. Liter-
ally, he contributes to the support
of the paper whether or not he thinks
it is worth reading. ‘

Mournfully, one observes the com-

plete lack of space regularly devoted
to material of any artistic or intel-
lectual interest. here‘ is The Week-
iy's dank comment upon the calibre
of men and women the University is
educating. One finds no book re-
views, no dramatic criticism, no dis-
cussion of painting, or of music. One
sees little or no mention of" these vi-
tal elements in a cultured existence,
unless it be a comment heavily laden
with the unbelievable inanity which
masquerades as collegiate humor.

One is told: “There is not suificient
interest." “The ‘high-brow‘ group is
too small." Let us assume that only
two hundred students have any in-
tellectual interest equal to what the
Weekly, perhaps, assumes to be the
impassioned student interest in com-
mittee meetings. Yet the two hundred
are tacitly, it not summarily, made
supporters of your eminently prac-
tical and thoroughly predictable
journal. »

What can be the explanation of The
Weekly's determination to appear un-
cultured?

A poem may not appear in The
Weekly except as a Joke. This, how-
ever, is not true of the news items.
‘,'We cover a larger news area than
any Weekly for the last two or three
years," the Weekly admits. Yes. but
on what a level! Larger! Volume!
‘Quantity, the bright banner of mo-
ronic evaluation!

Technically, The Weekly may point
to itself with pride. The makeup is
usually commendable. Permit me,
also, to compliment your advertis-
ing staff, whose success ought to be
a source of inspiration to your edi-
torlal powers. Unfortunately, the ed-
itorial staff does not deem it neces-
sary to strike a higher mental or
cultural level than that of the dol-
lar-collecting ‘ad agents.’ ‘

One would imagine a certain
amount of selectivity in the reading
public of a University news sheet.
Are not the interests of a student
group a bit more diversiﬁed and in-
telligent than your paper implies?

But I shall stop. I am a senior;
thus it is with little pleasure and no
little surprise that I find myself
writing my first letter-to-the-press.
Even I, however, still a youthful en-
thusiast, can see the futility of eval-
uating your unaudacious, sheepish
journal.

Truly, I am sorry The Weekly
seems ‘so aggressively mundane.
hope that some day it am he at
iesast as readable as it was our years

Play Class
Shows Wares

Student Directors P r o d u c e
Four One-Act Plays

 

The play production class under
Carl Cass successfully began its sec-
ond semester's work by producing
four one-act plays on Wednesday
evening at the Frick Training
School auditorium. The students
who directed the playlets were John
St. Peter, Col. '31; Jessie A. Vi.ches-
tain, Col. '33; Margaret Morrow,
Col. ’32, and Bernadette Connelly,
Ed. '31.

John St. Peter directed a play
written by Edna Strachan entitled
“The Chinese Water Wheel.” He had
under his direction Edna Mae Debt-
ling, Col. '33; Zita Doberneck, Ed.
'32; Alex Fekula, Ed. '34; Gene
Whitlatch, Col. '32, and Robert Mc-
Clurkin, Grad.

Second Play
“Where But In America” was
written by Oscar McWolﬁ‘ and was
presented by Rhea Colker, Col. '34;

Cynthia Dean, Col. '31, directed by
Bernadette Connelly.

Five persons made up the cast of
the third playlet, “A Late Delivery,”
written by Ian Hay. The cast, di-
rected by Jessie  Vicliestain, was:
George Schmieler, Col. '32; Herbert
Lauterbach, Ed. '32; Rosalind Light,
Col. '33; Jane Stanger, Ed. ’32, and
Milton Lawrence, Bus. Ad. '32.
“The Marriage Proposal,” a Rus-
sian play written by Anton Chekov,

'31, Richard Kennedy, Bus. Ad. '31,
and Josette Ulrich, Ed. '32, under
the direction of Margaret Morrow.

Debate Twice
  During Week

Rutgers, Carleton S q u a  3
Guests Of Univdrsity

 

 

 

Intercollegiate debates with the
representatives of two. institutions,
Rutgers University and Carleton
College, held here Wednesday and
Thursday, featured the activity of
the Men’s Debating Association this
week.

Both visiting teams arrived in
Pittsburgh on Wednesday and were
the guests of the
dinner in the Fairfax Hotel the
same evening, after which the Carle-
ton,squad accompanied the other
teams to the Central Y. W. C. A..,
where-Pitt and Rutgers argued the
question, “Resolved: _
eral States Should ‘Enact. Legisla-
tion Providing‘ for Compulsory Un-
employment Insurance.”

Edward T. Crowder, J r., Col. '31-;
Jess Spirer, Col. '31, and Robert J,
McClurkin, Grad., 4 _ _
negative of the question, opposing,
three affirmative speakers for
Rutgers. Following the policy of the.
University debate program, the den-_
bate was not judged and no deci-
sion other than that revealed _by
the usual audience “change of opin-
ion” VOLG was made. _

The Rutgers team did not remain
to hear the Pitt-Carleton debate the
following day, departing .by train
Wednesday ni ht for its home cam-
pus at New runswick, N. J.

Members of the Men’s Debating
Association and the Carleton speak-
ers met together at luncheon in the
King Edward Coffee‘ Shop, Thurs-
day noon, and then disbanded until
that evening. Thursday- evening
the same three-man team of the
Univeisitv met Carleton’s traveling
forensic stars "in a lively discussion
of the unemployment question. Pitt
again presented the argument for
the negative. This debate was held
before the Dormitory Club of the
Downtown Y. M. C. A.

With these two college teams the
guests of the University at the
same time, and with the respective
contests scheduled within a day of
each other, this weeks’ program
was one of the most intensive of the
forensic season.‘ '

Monday evening, Crowder and
Spirer will oppose two speakers
from Boston University, debating
unemployment insurance before the
Crafton Knights of. Columbus". De-
bate Manager Crowder states ;that
plans for the eastern trip, which
will probably close the debate sea-
son at the University and which
will carry the speakers as far east
and north as Boston, are nearing
completion. “The

Four blue ribbons on fourmanly

 

‘ chests with the name, “Beta Gamma

Sigma,” printed in gold lettering,
indicate that four students in the
school _of Business Administration
will be initiated into that fraternity
in a ceremony being held in the
Ruskin Apartments tonight at six
o’clock.

The men to be initiated are Clyde
Williams, Malcomb Lambing, Fred-
erick Pﬁschner and Joseph Matan.
The threefold qualiﬁcations required
for admittance to this -national hon-
orary business administration fra-
ternity are a good moral character,
high scholastic record and promise
of marked business ability.

Mr. Carl F. Distelhorst, account-
ing instructor, who is in charge of
the affair, expects ﬁwenty fraternity
members from both the student body
and the faculty. Preceding the ini-
tiation, a banquet will be’ served.
The initiation consists mainly of a
series of addresses that have been
prepared by the pledges. Mr. Wil-
liams will discuss “Scientiﬁc Re-
search in the General Electric Com-
pany”; Mr. Lambing will outine :1
“Suggested Curricula for Business

present school year., Of all those
students pledged to fraternities dur-
ing the ﬁrst four months of school,
only slightly more than half, '53 per
cent to be‘ exact, were found to be
eligible for initiation when ﬁrst se-
mester grades were announced. No
student may be initiated into a fra-
ternity until he has obtained twelve
credits and twelve quality points_in
Fthe-immediately preceding semes-
ter.
 This rule which was adopted by
‘Interfraternity ‘Council last spring
was expectedto relieve conditions
among fraternal groups imposed
‘upon them .under the former regu-
.lations which prohibited 9. man from
pledging until he had obtained the“
necessary credits and quality points.
Immediately upon announcement
of the ﬁrst semester grades there
was a reaction among fraternities.
Those houses boasting of a high per-
centage of men eligible for initia-
tion found the rules rather satisfac-
tory, but the less fortunate groups
were long and loud in their wailing
at the existing regulations.
Because of the interest in the sit-
uation, the Pitt Weekly presents a
survey ‘of ‘fraternity opinion con-
ducted among presidents of the
various houses in conjunction with
the dean of men. _ ‘
Harry A. Neidig, president of
Lambda Chi Alpha, ﬁnds the present
rules satisfactory because as he

time to decide upon fraternity ques-
tions, andat the same time it gives
the fraternities a chance to help him
scholastically and -socially.”

‘Ad’ Billions
  A.K.Psi Topic

Advertising C o s t Discussed
By Worcester Tuesday

 

 

“Advertising Billions” was the
subject of the third lecture of a se-
ries, given by William L. Worcester
‘Jr., instructor in commerce, on last

Tuesday, March 17, to the Alpha
Kappa Psi, professional business
fraternity.

Mr, Worcester stated that the
amount of money spent annually for
advertising in the United States is
$2,000,000,000. He went on to say
that this amount is justiﬁed because
of the changing methods of mer-
chandising. In the past it was pri-
marily concerned with the local cen-
ters; at present, it is a world-wide
affair.

The main reason for this change
of policy is the Industrial Revolu-
tion. Other reasons are that we
have more money, education and
leisure time. These are directly re-
sponsible for the existance of a buy-
er's market today.

Economic Side

Taking up the economic side, Mr.
Worcester conclusively proved the
value of advertising. The relative
cost of advertising compared with
the total amount of business done is
not rowing larger, but is growing
smal er. Moreover, the price of ari-
vertised commodities has increased
less than the price of unadv'ertised'
commodities. /

Advertising pays for itself by sell-
ing goods more economically. It re-
duces the ﬁnal cost of producing the
goods, made possible, through mass
distribution which results in mass
production. .

Mr. Worcester has discovered
through his studies that the two

reatest evils -of the advertising pro-
Ai ession are, ﬁrst, the wide-s read
use of testimonials, and secon , the
granting of so-called allowances to
syndicate buyers. ,

“Chain Store Within the Commu-
nity” will be the subject of the next
talk by r. Worcester, on Tuesday,
March 24. It will take pla e at the
Alpha Kappa Psi priva dining
room at the Hotel Roosevelt.

Italian Students Plan
Dance At Schenley

The Italian club will meet today
in Room'315 Alumni Hall to dis-
cuss plans for a dance to be held,
May 22 at Schenley Hotel. At the

will also discuss plans for their

Tuesday evening, the club held a I

Sigma Pi fraternity, and E. Milton
Cohen, president of Phi Epsilon Pi.
The latter adds -“The system of
getting quality ridints for initiation
puts the, burden on the fraternity,
where it rightfully belongs. This is
one of the primary purposes of a
_fraternity-to improve the scholas-
tic average of its members and
pledges.” ,

Although not convinced that the
present rushing rules are success-
ful, but apparently unwilling to give
them up without further trial,
Eugene Pry, president of Phi‘ Gam-
mnf Delta andcalso lresident of 11111-
te ratemity ounci, stresses t e
thought that the present rules make
it possible for a man to pledge in
the early part -of the school year
when Pry thinks that he needs fra-
ternal association the most.

“The. scholastic requirements nec-
essary for each freshman to attain
before being eligible for initiation is
a very satisfactory regulation for ﬁt
aids materially in maintaining t e
scholastic standards the fraternities
have set,” says Harold L. Friedman,
Rex of Pi‘ Lambda Phi. .Mr. Fried-

Thgta . Chi, spealﬁing thronglh its
presi ent, W.“ A. amsey, e ieves
’;lhat the pgesent system of rushing

as prove to be much more suc-
cessful than the-system in force last
year. “The new system lgives 3
wider choice “ of materia , an
through earlier contact with the
pledges, the fraternity is able to as-
sist the freshmen ‘toward higher
scholastic attainment,” voices Ram-

se .

}Arthur George enrolls the Omega
Delta on the side of those favoring
the rules when he says: “The new
rules ive each fraternity the op-
portunity to ‘earn’ men rather than
bid for men.”

“A grab-bag system,” “too expen-

amples of phrases used by those
fraternities expressing discontent
with the regulations. _

Sigma Alpha Epsilon, under the
leadership of Daniel Butler, thinks
that the present system places ﬁrst
impression at a premium and rele-
gates scholarship to the background.

says: “Any advantages the system
may possess are more than coun-
teracted by the uncertainties of
temporary pledgeship."

Although dissatisﬁed with the rel-
atively small percentage of men eli-i
gible for initiation after the expense
incurred by fraternal groups during
rushing season, James B. Hanson,
until recently president of Kappa
Sigma, believes that the rules merit
a further trial.

Robert Kleeb, who guides the des-
tinies at the Phi Kappa house, is
emphatic in his disapproval of the
present set-up. He outlines his ob-
jections like this: “First, concentra-
tion of rushing by all houses causes
independence of pledges; second, el-
igibility of every freshman increases
the number of rushees enormously,
causing a terrific overhead expense
on each fraternity; third, it has
made fraternity control over pledges
almost an impossibility; fourth,
‘mud-slinging’ exists that never
was prevalent before; ﬁfth, the sys-
tem was meantto educate the fresh-
man and‘ it has educated him ‘too
much; sixth, fraternity life, because
of deferred rushing, is losing its en-
ticement." .

' George Boggs, president of Delta
Tau Delta, is not in favor of the
present system of pledging and sug-
gests that “rushing season be more
of a time when fraternities‘ and

instead of a series of events ‘at
which the freshman is ill at ease and
attends only because he feels it is
the thing to do.”

Sigma Chi enrolls on the side of
the opposition when Robert George,
president, says: “I favor the one
semester deferred rushing program

Butler, in expressing his sentiments, ate

After the Phi Delta Theta chap-
ter voted unanimously in opposition
to the rushing rules, Thomas W. Mc-
Lean, president, declared: “With
such a high percentage of ineligible
freshmen as the University has had,
not only this year but in previous
ones, deferred rushing gives 3
means of elimination and selection,
badly needed but not provided un-
der the present system. It is-ob-
viously impossible to weed out pros-
pective ineligibles in the heat of
rushing season."

Clarence Rogers, president of Del-
ta Sigma Phi, believes that the
newest rushing regulations are an
improvement over the former sys-

ferred rushing.

The most startling suggestion of
all those interviewed was that of
Edward Pugia, president of Alpha
Phi Delta, who favored a plan
whereby freshmen would have im-
mediate permission to move into
fraternity houses at the opening of
school, but would not be permitted

twelve quality points had been at-
tained.‘ If the freshman should fail
to obtain the necessary quality
points and credits he would have to
leave the fraternity house at the
end of “the semester.

Morris N aumoif, president of Sig-
ma Alpha Mu, completes the list
with a cheer for the present sys-
tem. He thinks that fraternity. men
have greater enthusiasm and spirit
during a rushing season of the ﬁrst
semester and that more men have
the opportunity of becoming affili-
ated with a fraternity which encour-
ages them to obtain a high scholas-

sive," “a system featured by care-
lessness ~ and overenthusiasm” are ex-

for pledging. I feel that these '.re-
quirements eliminate the carrying

How To Grade Students

By Maurice G. Gurin

Intelligence or actual work——upon
which should a student be‘ graded?

In an attempt to reach some conclu-

sion on this question, prominent‘ pro-

fessors of the University were in-

terviewed. '
Turner

Dr. Ralph E. Turner, associate
professor of history, looks upon in-
telligence from the point of view of
objective psychology:

‘'1 don't know anything about a.
student's intelligence, other than he
usually credits himself with hav-

ing more than he actually possesses.

All I know is about'his perform-
ance, which is relative, in the first
place, to what I expect and, in the
second place, to the performance of
other students judged by the same
standard.”

James C. Charlesworth, instructor
of political science, looks upon in-
telligence as an “index” in bio-chem-
istry: .

“There is no ‘such thing ‘as theo-
retical ‘A’ capacity, with actual ‘C’.
results, caused, e.g., by corporeal
laziness, All of the attributes of a
student constitute one ﬂuid whole;
hence the estimate of a student by a
professor should be based only upon
the results of a student's work, un-
inﬂuenced byliis ‘attitude; his prom-
ise,’ his ‘deep interest,’ etc.”

Ratio

Dr. Evan T. Sage, head ofthe de-
partment of Latin, bases his grad-
ing upon the ratio between astu-
dent’s actual. work and the profes-
sor’s conception of his capacity:

“There should be some agreement
betweenwork and ability. If I think
a student has ‘A’ capacit and if
he does ‘B’ work, I shoud grade
him ‘C’. My mark is my estimate of
the degree of’ success with which -a
student has utilized his capacity.”

Dr. John H. McFadden, instructor

personal method: I

“The number of students in the
average classroom makes the con-
sideration of subjective factors
quite impossible,‘ even if such con-
sideration were not subject to nu-
merous difficulties. I grade the stu-
dent on» the work he does. Assuming
that examinations are valid meas-
uring devices of a student's mastery
of the subject (and it isiverylikely.
that many times they are not), they
should give an objective ‘result..¥‘j I
don't‘ place ‘much conﬁdence in the
grade.” - ~

Dr. Mont R. Gabbert, head of the
department of philosophy, makes an’
interesting observations‘ I ; .-

“.If intelligence could be "meas-
ured, the student's I.Q. would de-
termine his grade. But then, what
about giving credit to those who.
don't go to college? It’ appears.
therefore, that. the grade should
measure achievement, what a stu-
dent does, not what he could do.”

Silverman
Dr. Alexander Silverrnan, head of

I the department of chemistry, also

favors performance as the basis of
grading:

“Ability is generally judged by
performance: evidence through the
spoken and written word and experi-
mentation. Ability is extremely ‘im-
portant; but unless a student uti-
lizes his capacity, he does not‘ con’-
tribute. Laziness can cause a good
mind to ‘ e to seed." It should be‘

in his performance. In judging the
performance of a student in the
chemistry department, a number of
the faculty members participate; the
result, then, is a composite rather
than an individual judgment.”

Ernest J. Wright, instructor in
English, also holds, more or less, to
the bio-chemical theory:

Bio-Chemical

“Actual work is a just and accu-
rate expression of a student's ca-
pacity. Any one piece of work is
the measure of his capacity at that
time, and all his work will give a
measureof his dependable, workable
capacity or norm. _A part of intel-
ligence is the utilization of itself.
There is no such thing as inactive
intelligence, intelligence in the ab-
stract. One’s capacity is his ability
to handle a situation. Lack of in-
terest, laziness, etc., are signs of
unintelligence.”

Marion K. McKay, head of the de-
partment of economics, excludes ca-
pacity from his consideration of a
student's grade: .

“The grade should represent a
student's accomplishments without
reference to his potentialities“ which
he hasn't exercised. There are indi-
cations of greater ability ‘in some
students, but innate ability that
isn't utilized has no use. Ye shall
be judged and rewarded by the work
you do and not by your possibili-
ties.” \

Dr. Archie G. Worthing, head of
the department of physics, feels
that endeavor should inﬂuence but
little the grade given in college:

“Performance, as a measure of ac-
complishment, is the main" factor.
That which a student gains from a
course, makes a part of himself,‘ in-
corporates into his thinkingself, is
the basis of my grading.”

At Conference

Noted Author To Lecture On
Present-Day Russia

 

 

Dr. Sherwood Eddy, noted author
and secretary for Asia in the Na-
tional Council of the Young Men’s
Christian Association, has been se-
cured as the principal speaker at a
Social and Religious Issues Confer-
ence to be held on the campus March
30 and April 1, under the auspices
of the Y. M. and W. C. A. ‘

Dr. Eddy has recently returned
from a speaking tour of the world,
traveling through some twenty
countries, and from conducting his
tenth annual tour of representative
American writers and speakers who
have endeavored to make an impar-
tial study of European and world
conditions. Mr. Eddy having touched
recently the principal countries of
Europe and Asia and having had
private exclusive interviews with
Ramsay MacDonald, Stanley Bald-
win, Lloyd George, G. Bernard
Shaw and other political and indus-
trial leaders, is qualiﬁed to speak at
the Social Conference. His recent
talks with President Hindenburg
and Prof. Einstein in Germany and
with Mr. Ghandi and the Viceroy in
India will be reviewed in the series
of speeches he will make on the
campus. _

Although internationally known as
a speaker, Dr. Eddy is almost as
equally well known as a writer and
constructive thinker. His most re-
cent books include “The Challenge
of Russia,” “Religion and Social
Justice,” “New Challenges to Faith,”
“Facing the Crisis,” “Everybody’s
World” and “The New World of
Labor.”

Dr. Eddy’s series of speeches here

Challenge of Russia,” “the Present
World Situation ” “Danger Zones of
the World” and Gandhi and India.”
His speeches hint that he has found
a “meaning in life” and are force-
ful messages for its interpretation.
The schedule for the conference «will
be announced in the*next issue of
the. Pitt Weekly. ‘

- S Congratulations are once more in order for Coach George
-I)_I_owallis and his successful freshman basketball team for their
successful season just completed with a record of fourteen vic-

tories against four defeats.

Coach Kowallis, has a record of

Glvvictories with but seven losses in his four years of coach-

an entirely new array of mate-

started the
season off by defeating South High
in -9. close game, 26-24. They next
tackled Johnstown and Eric Junior
Pitt Colleges, whom they easily de-
feated. Scott High, their next op-
I ent, gave the Panthers their
Iiiiltial setback, 28-22. The little
Panthers quickly recovered from
this defeat, and easily trounced
Erie, Uniontown and West Virginia
frosh, before being handed an un-

expected setback by the Tech plebes,

‘I Lose to State

A switch in the personnel of the
team resulted in another string of
victories being turned in against
Kiski (twice), Johnstown, W. & J.,
and Uniontown. The Penn State
frosh were the next to take the lit-
Panthers’ measure, defeating
them 24-23, in an overtime period.
The_ Panthers got revenge from
Tech plebes for their‘ early season

next to feel the sting of defeat, but
the West Virginia frosh pulled the
unexpected by soundly defeating
the‘ Panthers, 56-34. _ _

1 Thelittle Panthers, after winning
by low scores at the beginning of
the season, turned in some sizeable
scores to ﬁnish the season with ‘a
total of 491‘ points scored against

_ t_hei'r opponents’ 417.

The freshmen have a wealth of
material which will prove useful to
Coach Carlson for the next season.

A -. All the frosh have shown a. marked

ability in handling the ball, and
Coach Kowallis has developed some
of. the best shooters to wear Pan-
ther uniforms.

Ochsenhirt Looks Good
“Dutch” Ochsenhirt leads
freshmen prospects, with Hughes,
Hunt‘ and McBride following close-
_l_y. Ochsenhirt has played a great

ﬂoor game this year, and has shown

that he can pass, dribble and shoot
accurately. Inside the foul line, his

 shooting at the basket is nothing

short of miraculous. Ochsenhirt
should make a good guard for Carl-
son to pair up with Don Smith for
next year, as his height will make
him a valuable asset in getting the
ball on the board.

Hughes has played a consistent
game all season and should easily
fit in as a forward, as he has‘ both
the height and the ability to handle
the ball easily. He is a good shot
from the ﬂoor and from the char-
ity line. Neither Hunt nor McBride
were regulars at the beginning of
the season, but they showed their
worth to the team when put in as
reserves, and earned the coveted
regular berths. ‘

Hunt. is an exceptionally good
dribbler, and has the knack of
shooting with either hand. Mc-
Bride has shown himself to be an
excellent ﬂoor man and almost sin-
gle-handed won the ﬁrst West Vir-
ginia game. Both Hunt and »Mc-
Bride should see service next year.

McCamant Ails

Don McCamant, who was sick the
greater part of the ‘season, should
also see service next season, as he
showed himself to be a good steady-
ing inﬂuence on the ﬂoor as well as
aigood shot during the short time
he played. .

Ochsenhirt has led the scorers
throughout the greater part of the
season, scoring 128 points, eclipsing
Zola Alpert’s record of 126 points
made last year. Hughes

Duquesne In Opening

Of Athletic Relations

A ' Soft-spoken men

in hard-boiled

shirts and immaculate tuxedos

waited in vain for the expected thousands to attend the opening of ath-
letic relations between Pitt and Duquesne at the Duke gym_ last Sat-
urday night. The entire “active” part ,_of the Pittsburgh Police depart-
ment, four policemen -and a lieutenant, were on. hand and fully pre-
pared to keep the rival student bodies from rioting. The only flaw in

the whole plan was the total absence of a‘ student

riot of any so as

the'Pitt boxers went down to defeat '

at the hands of the Duke mittmen,
the score being four to three.

-‘Joe Miletus got off to a bad start
in the opening ﬁght of the evening,
in the 115-pound class, when he

. lost the decision to Fred Vitulla of

Duquesne. Miletus showed a de-

. A cided reverse, of form from his last
light, and after holding. the

ﬁrst
round even, lost the next two by
pretty large margins. Milt Bradley,
ﬁghtinglunder the handicap of a bad
rib; held Joe Vernacci of Duquesne
to a draw after three rounds. Brad-
ley’s smile, which Vernacci failed
toerase, seemed to discourage the
Duke man. Bradley showed lots of
improvement, especially in his box-
mg.
San-ticolo Victor

In one of the wildest swinging
ﬁghts of the evening, Marius San-
ticola brought victory to Pitt by
soundly beating Reuben Denmark.
Both boys were excited at the start
of the ﬁght, and with all the leather
swinging -in the first round, few
blows were landed. Santicola, how-
ever, calmed down and took the last
two rounds. He, like Bradley,
showed more speed and punch than
in his last appearance.

Henry Martin received a draw
against George Chacko of Duquesne
football fame. The ﬁrst two rounds
were identical in performance, with

 Chacko chancing a wild swing, miss-
: ing and racing around the ring with

Martin in full pursuit. These rounds,
although funny to the crowd, were

sisted upon catching up and pound-
ing him.

For the second successive week,
Jack Shricker brought victory to
Pitt,~besides showing the best brand
of boxing of the evening, Shricker
took all three rounds from Stepek
ofvDuquesne,v and the verdict was
never in doubt.

ended in technical knockouts, and
victories for Duquesne. Glen
Thomas scored a technical K.O. over
Zimmerman, in a one-sided ﬁght.
Zimmerman appeared groggy after
the ﬁrst, round. After he had showed
real promise against the Little Club,
Joe Tommins‘, suffered both a re-
versal of form and a technical
knockout at the hands of Carl Abing-
ton. Tommins was outclassed from
the beginning, and after he had hit
the canvas repeatedly in the last
two rounds, the referee wisely
stopped the ﬁght, giving it and «vic-
tory to Duquesne.

Turbyville Resigns;
Will Leave In June

Fred Turbyville, who takes care
of publicity at the stadium, has
tendered his resignation which is to
take effect this June. He was ap-
pointed last June to the position and
he will end one year stay then.

6 Looking Them Over
i with the ,
_ CAMPUS SCOUT  

Just before the Pitt basketball team left for.State College last week
V ‘of the season for both teams, we saw
Willie Kowallis and asked him to have the fellows pick an all-opponent

As usual, Willie was dependable in that hegmentioned the fact to the .
boys, but there was such a wide variance of opinion on who should occupy
the ﬁrst team position that the boys did not pick a ﬁrst team but they
mentioned the outstanding players against whom they played.

, From what Willie repo.rted,there were more good players at guard
positions this year than there were at the other posts. Five guards re-
tlie»Pitt‘ players, while four forwards and

The names of those mentioneidhare -as follows:

Katz, Syracuse, guard
Baldwin, Notre Dame, guard
Fergus, Carnegie Tech, guard
Fesler, Ohio State, guard
Hokuif, Nebraska, guard

/Nebraska and Notre Dame, both of whom were defeated by Pitt, l_
were the only schools to have more than one player mentioned in this

list. Creighton and City College of New York, two ofthe four teams which
defeated the Panthers, did not place a manin this select group.

When naming the forwards, the Pitt players remembered the ﬁne

showing made by the Western Reserve man who .wore the .number“‘six”
jersey, ‘but they were unable to recall his name. Not to slight him, we in-
clude the number of his jersey in‘ the list.

Maclay was recently chosen on the ﬁrst team of the all-star “Big

team._Katz was named on many. of the all-American basketball
selections in 1930, and from the form which he has displayed to

For the ﬁrst time since Jock.
Sutherland, football mentor.
~ has taken over the destiny of
the grid team here, he has is-
sued a call for aspirants to
football fame. Weight,‘ experi-
ence, speed, everything is. cast
to the winds in the University-
r wide challenge. Any‘ eligible
student who. knows he can, or
thinks he can,‘ play football is
requested to -report at the ‘sta-
dium at 3:45 o'clock Monday
afternoon. .

According to Bernard Windt,
. varsity football manager, all
meniireporting will be given a
uniform and a fair chance to
gain jobs on the varsity team
or bench. Men who show. ex-
ceptional ability will probably
be taken with the Panthers to
their lair next September at
Windber. ‘ v

Any freshman desiring to
try out for the frosh squad is
to report at the same time.

All ‘managers, and those
wishing to try out for appren-
tice managership are requested
to report to.Windt this after-
noon ’at.the stadium. This call

Enviable Records

-followers. With a record of

of the country the Pitt cagers, while
not able to claim the National Cham-
pionship, can well claim the East-

. ern Championship andwhave -their

claim substantiated by their record.
Beat Easterners

Winning fourteen out of I ﬁfteen
conflicts with Eastern opponents, the
list of victims convinces a person of
the justiﬁcation of Pitt’s claim.

The Panthers hold victories over
Dartmouth, conquerors of Colum-

bia, champions of the Eastern In-
tercollegiate League; Syracuse,
which had another strong team this
year; Fordham, N. Y. U., Penn ‘and
Army. Army was considered in the
running for Eastern honors until
the Pitt cagers beat them. The Pitt
team won all of their games in the
tri-state region, their record in-
.cluding victories over Carnegie,
Penn State, West Virginia and
Wash-Jeff. i . ,
C. C. N. Y. was the only Eastern
team able to beat the Panthers. In
Panthers, after
amassing a big lead in the ﬁrst half,
died away and scored only Htwo

. points in the second half. Notwith-

standing this defeat the Panthers
were able to defeat Fordham rather
easily. Fordham turned around
and beat C. C. N. Y. Thus, by the
process of elimination, the Panthers
h_ave a very good claim for_ the
Eastern Championship.

The three seniors, Baker, Arture
and Cohen, pjayed their last game
last Saturday and acquitted them-
selves nobly. All season these men
have done good work and next year

achievement.

In his work of getting points,
Lawry was well aided and abetted
by “Willie” Kowallis, who was only
eight points behind Lawry in total
points scored. Smith—,.a sophomore,
this year, was the man who made
the absence of Baker hardly notice-
able in the earlier part of the sea-
son. Smith hurt his knee and was
out for a good bit of the season,
but when he came back he started

' right in where he left off before he

was hurt. Allbright, another soph-
omore, was a stalwart on the de-
fense all season. Toward the end
of the season he started scoring and
made his presence felt.

Mountaineers
Get Revenge

West Virginia Rejoice: In
Boxing Victory

 

 

An experienced West Virginia
team proved to be too much for the
Pitt boxers at Morgantown ' on
Wednesday night and made a clean
sweep of the six bouts before a
crowd of 4,000 rabid Mountaineer
fans. The, victory gave the Moun-
taineers sweet revenge for the" set-
backs received in football and bas-
ketball, but the one-sided score does
not tell the true story of the ﬁghts.

Harry Conti, a newcomer to the
Panther boxers, opened up the fes-
tivities with a fast slugging bout
with Heatherman. Conti took the
ﬂrst round, lost the second by a
shade, and seemed to hold the last
round even. ‘ It was a case of wild
swinging on the part of both boys;
and when Heatherman decided to

, box it out, he got the decision.

Rib Handicap

With his rib. still in terrible
shape, “Smilin ” Milt Bradley put
up a game ﬁg t against Morrison.
Bradley decided to box the ﬁght out
and easily took the first round. Mor-
rison took the second, and the third
was even. Bradley fought under a
terrible handicap and must be rated
highly for the showing which he
made. 0

Overwhelming odds were personi-
fied in the Santicola-Hesse fight.
Hesse, who towered a foot over San-
ticola, bored in at the beginning of
the second round. Hesse landed
two on the nose, causing it to bleed.
The referee stopped the ﬁght at
this point and awarded it to Hesse,
who was leading by a. wide margin.
Both Santicola and Manager Ben
Sufrine protested the decision,
claim Santicola was not hurt, but
the ruling stuck.

Henry, Martin surprised the fans
by putting up a great ﬁght against
Captain Stunkard of the Mountain-
eers. Stunkard, a ring veteran with
an inch of beard, fought cleanly, as
did Martin, and the result was little
holding and much action. It was a
slugging match from the start, with
Martin taking Stunkard’s best and

' giving his own in return.

N 0 Decision Bout

In a no-decision bout, Jack
Schricker put up his usual fast
ﬁght, hitting Marty Brick with ev-

. erything but the mats and ring-

posts. Unfortunately, his one-sided
yictory did not count in the scor-

in .
iatham of West Virginia scored

 a knockout over Zimmerman of Pitt
 in the first round. One of Lathan’s

punches caught Zimmerman on the
eye, forcing the eye-lid inside out.
Zimmerman took a short count to
try to straighten it out and came
up to ﬁght with but one good eye.
This did not prove to be enough.
Johnny Luch put up a good ﬁght
against Hawkins. Luch rushed the
fighting, and when Hawkins, a vet
eran of 18 previous intercollegiate
bouts, decided to resort to boxing,
his superior ring neralship gave
him the decision. uch absorbed a

 lot of punishment but kept on com-
" ing back.

D is c a 1' cl Track House For
Stadium Field

 

Way up on top of the hill, over-
looking the present motionless in-
terior of the Stadium, there is a

wooden building referred to by those
in the know as the Track House.
The gentleman who directs the op-
erations which go on. within that
structure is the lawyer coach, Shea,
and of his subsequent monickers, the
jﬁrst is not of the slightest impor-
tance to those who daily gather
there.

The building serves’ as a retreat
for the Track Team and enables
them to continue their training
throughout the cold, snowy months.
When the rest of the world is win-
ter-prisoned, the members of the
Track Team go through their daily
routine unperturbed. Perhaps, un-
perturbed is not the Word, for fre-
quently when the weather"beconies
unusually frigid, the few stoves in
the building are found out to be too
few, and, as a result, chattering
teeth and resounding spikes unite to
produce a truly weird symphony.

But those days are just about over
for this season and in another week
the Track Team will move their
quarters down into the Stadium. And
that is when track men really be-
come track men! Th-en the trim legs
can let out all the speed which has
been restrained all these months;
then the hurdlers can leap over more
than one hurdle without worrying
about a bend in the track; and then
Coach_Shea can coach without night-
ly having to have his shoes scrubbed.

Barring those two bugbears, in-

the season. There is some doubt as
to the team which wound up in
third place due to the postponement
of the Omega Delta game last week.
This game will be played off next
Week. .

Delta Tau Delta caused a triple
tie for the leadership in section
by winning over Sigma Alpha Mu,
which had previously been unde-
feated, while the Kappa Sigs were
winning over the Phi‘ Kaps.

The Kappa Sigs had won over the

 

P Delts in the opening game of the
season for both teams, but they lost 0

a week later to Sigma Al ha Mu.
All three teams won th 1- other
games in the league.

The captains of these teams will
meet in the office of the dean of

for the playoffs for the champion-

ship.
Plil Gams Protest V

Phi Gamma Delta and Kappa Nu
are in the running for the cham-
pionship of section C, both being un-
defeated to date. The two teams
met last week with the Kappa Nus
winning 12-8, but after the game it
was discovered that Yoﬂ:‘e of the
winners had four personals before
the end of the third quarter which
ended 8-8, but due to an error on
the part of the scorekeeper, who
listed one of these fouls as a tech-
nical one, Yoffe was not put out of
the game. _

The Phi Gains protested the game
on this technicality, and their pro-
test was upheld by the athletic com-
mittee of interfraternity council.
The playoff will be held Tuesday
evening at 8:30 o’clock at either
Trees gym or at the stadium. At
7:30 o’clock at the same. place, Ome-
ga Delta and Sigma Pi will play
their game which was postponed due
to the former team’s members being
under quarantine at the time when
the game was originally scheduled
to be played.

These mixups will delay the play-
offs for the championship of the
whole loop. Both the winners and
the runner-ups will be awarded cups
which will ‘be held permanently.

juries and ineligibility, the pros-
pects of a winning track team this
year are rather bright, brighter, in
fact, than they were last year. Just
recently the Pitt team was forced
to cancel their engagement at the
Cleveland A. C. games because "of
the illness of their coach. But Mr.
Shea has already commenced to re-
cover and that cancellation should
in no wise retard_ the conditioning
of the team for the spring meets.
One of the brightest spots on the
Pitt team comes in the personage of
Everett Utterback, the versatile
broad-jumper, hurdler, s p r i nter,
high-jumper, decathlon luminary and
what not. Everett was hampered by
injuries last year and frequently
failed to perform in themanner of
which he is capable; but this sea-
son, barring unforeseen tough-luck
breaks, he is expected to prove a
tower of strength to the Pitt team,
and, incidntally, a stumbling block
between Mr. Berlinger of Penn and
his annual decathlon trophy. Al-
ready, Everett is preparing himself
for Berlinger and the Penn relays,
despite the fact that the relays are
not scheduled to be held until April

25.

Second Section Triple Tie
Holds Up Semi-Finals

 

 

Psi Omega, champions of the
dental interfraternity council, have
issued their annual challenge to the
winners of the inter-fraternity bas-
ketball leag-ue. This year, however,

they have gone further and asked
that they be admitted to the semi‘-
ﬁnal playoffs and if they win, be
pefmitted to participate in the fi-
na s.

Since there will be only three
teams in the semi-ﬁnals, they argue.
it will eliminate the handicap of one
team playing two games in succes-
sion. They challenge that if the real
winner of the various fraternities at
Pitt is desired, it is only fair that
they be included in the playoff.

However, the senii~ﬁnals seem
far in the distance, as the second
section was all knotted up when the
Delts defeated the Sigma Alpha Mus
last Wednesday evening. This leaves
the Kappa Sigs, who defeated the
Delts earlier in the season, and the
Sigma Alpha Mus, who defeated the
Kappa Sigs in the first skirmish all
up in the first post.

As yet, Mr. Dambach has not de-
cided when the playolfs will be, but
it probably will be held next week.
e winners of these matches will
meet the Phi Deltswho knocked off

the Sig Alpha last Tuesday night.

“I’d RatherBe In The Ring”

By AL. ALPERN

The '

general belief prevalent among the laymen concerning boxing is

ptioii to the rule was demonstrated

at the Duquesne match last Saturday.

While Ohacko of Duquesne
example of how not to ﬁght and

and Martin of Pitt were giving a good
how not to get hurt, several bystanders

were injured seriously enough to give the impression of having partici-

pated in a “Battle of the Century.”<‘x

I._am referring to Coach Orsini, As-
sistan-t Manager Bachrach and 9. Dn-
quesne manager Whose features
were so beyond recognition because
of his injuries that he was unrecog-
nizable.

It seems on the Duquesne ring
there was an insidious weapon that
managed to ensnare these men. We
do not know why, how or what put
it there. The snooper of this de-
partment believes that it was put
there by some ardent Duquesne sup-
porter in an effort to handicap the
Pitt team. Maybe he is right, may-
be he’s wrong. But there is one
thing we are certain of and that is
it was there. In description it cor-
responded to a marlin spike, what-
ever that is. Anyway, it protruded
from the riii in such a manner to
cut Orsini, achrach and the un-
known Duke man on the face.

Monday in school when I saw Or-
sini and Bachrach I did not see
them. That is, I saw them but ﬁrst
I saw huge patches of n_iercuro-

chrome spread longitudinally, hori-
zontally, and all the other ways you
learn about in freshman geometry.
When asked about their condition,
that story of the insidious spike came
ou .

The latest knowledge concerning
these men reveals they have taken
up boxing. I do not blame them.

Paul Zehfuss
F rosh Coach

Succeed: Kowallio, Cub Coach
For Three Years

 

 

Paul Zehfuss has been named
freshman basketball coach to replace
George Kowallis, who resigned nev-
oral weeks ago, it was announced
here last week.

Zehfuss, who is now in his first
year at Medical School, entered Pitt
in 1926 and immediately became I
valuable member of the freshman
ﬂoor team of that year. He then
played on the reat varsity teams of
'27, *’28, and ’ %, alongside of “Chip-
per” Charley Hyatt, “Les" Cohen,
and others. -. _

Zehfuss won fame during his stay
at Pitt as one of the best ﬂoor man
ever seen here. Although never at
the sensational type as Hyatt, he,
nevertheless, played an immeasur-
able part in the brilliant records Pitt
compiled in the years, ’27 to '29.“

Small in stature, he was-quick and
sure on his feet and had an unusu-
ally accurate efve for the basket. He
knew basketba lgin and out, was an
exceptionally able passer, and, de-
spite his small size, was tough and
rarely was out of the game -because
of injuries. ‘

Zehfuss will have a diii’icu1t'task
in measuring up to the standard set
him by Kowallis. Duriii three arc,
the teams coached by owallisfhavo
made a record of 60 games wonand
only 7 games lost. ' ‘
