UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

U.S. Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh said that the Soviet
Union still has a long way to go
for a “rule of law" in his speech at
the Law Building yesterday.

“The simple passage of new

laws is not enough,” he said.

“They need due process of law
for the reforms to work.”

Thornburgh, former governor
of Pennsyvania, said that the
Soviet Union must face some
problems with its culture before
it can get a system where law is
the supreme authority.

“The Soviet Union has suffered
through its own history of laws of
both the peasants and the czars,”
he said. “They have a naive belief
that passing laws will be enough.
They have no vision of a legal
culture. The only way they can
get one is by grounding the rules
into written laws and actively
enforcing them. True legal reform

must prevail.

“The civil rights of the people
of the Soviet Union are protected
by law except as exercised against
socialist and communist policies,”
he added.

He said that the Soviet Union
still suffers from what is known
as “telephone justice,” which was
started by Bolshevik leader
Vladimir Lenin. He said that Lenin
occasionally “rang up” judges in
the 1920s, and the judges would
come out with opinions in
agreement with Lenin. He also
noted some of the side effects
from this policy.

“Judges in the Soviet Union are
paid much less than the average
wage in the country,” he said. “In
fact, the only people paid less
than judges are commercial
lawyers.”

Thornburgh said that the
Soviets, during a meeting with
him last year in the Soviet Union,
were very impressed by how the
United States keeps its unity alive.

,.Tbornburgh raps Soviet reforms

“Ten years ago, the Soviets would
have attacked United States
policy,” he said. “Now, there is a
recitation of woes expressed
toward their system, and they
want more knowledge of ours.”

While in the Soviet Union,
Thornburgh said he met with
members of the Soviet Ministry of
Justice and even the KGB, the
Soviet secret police and
intelligence agency, in what he
called “historical and continuing
dialogue.” He said that they talked
about subjects such as a two-
party political system. He also
said that Soviet Minster ofjustice
Yakovlev would be visiting the
United States next month.

He called the recent events in
Eastern Europe a “seismic
disruption in a monolithic
empire,” and called on the Soviets
to recognize the human—rights
violations in Lithuania.

Thornburgh said that the Soviet
Union’s attempt at making new

just three months after inception, one of
Pitt’s newest student groups has made its
way into city politics.

At yesterday’s Pittsburgh City Council
meeting, Councilman Dan Cohen passed
a resolution recognizing Pitt’s Students

V’. Against Racism organization. Cohen

stressed ST AR’s large growth and purpose
in the resolution.

“Whereas STAR was founded at a
meeting of a few students concerned
about racism on Jan. 1, 1990, and [has]
already giown to almost 60 members, and
whereas [its] main goals [are] to end as
much racial prejudice  as possible and to
educate the community as to the cause

Dick Thomburgh (right) talks with President Wesley Posvar before his speech yesterday.

“City Council recognizes efforts of new student group

and effect of racism,” Cohen said,
“Pittsburgh [City Council] commends their
effort. They give us hope for the future.”

After the resolution was passed, four
members of STAR gave short presentations.
Matt Sipple, founder and president, talked
about his Vision of STAR.

“We as a school, we as a city and we as
a country have so many important issues
to deal with and problems to solve today,
yet we cannot even treat each other as
equal human beings,” Sipple said. ‘‘I
founded STAR in the hopes that it will
eventually become a group that can make
a difference.”

told the council that racism has been a
great obstacle to him in his four years at

policies criticized

The speech of U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh
was met by protestors criticizing his policies in Central America.
One of the protestors, Melanie Morris, ran up to the podium
in the Law Schoo1’s Teplitz Memorial Courtroom before the
speech and criticized the “Thornburgh, Doctrine,” announcing
to the crowd that the United States had become an outlaw

“This doctrine goes against the laws that the United States
was founded on,” she said. “According to this, the United States "
is allowed to violate the laws of other countries. This is the same
thing the Soviets are doing in Lithuania.” She was then taken
from the courtroom amidst many boos from the audience.

Morris was one of five protestors outside the Law School
yesterday who were carrying signs reading “LaRouche says:
Give Lithuania Independence, not Soviet Troops” and handing
out pro—LaRou che literature. One of the protestors was dressed
as the Grim Reaper as part of the protest.

Jon Anderson/The Pitt News

“There have been obstacles that have
stood in my path of achievement, and one
obstacle refused to be beaten; this obstacle
has great strength,” he said. “I’m not going
to go into the feelings of a black man living
in a white man’s world phase; that is not
what God had in mind when he created
this world. He gave it to us, the people, us
as one, not to individuals and not to one
race.”

Lara Cook, public-relations committee
chairwoman, and Luigi Giovine, SLAR»
planning—committee chairman, also spoke
at the meeting. Giovine said that the
resolution is an acknowledgement of all
the hard work that STAR has done and
could help the group in the future.

“It is a matter of principle. After the little
bit of time since we started, an official act

T EN SJIIEDJE2 National high school Wrestling tourney...page 10

by City Council is an indication of a certain
community response to our effort,” Giovine
said. “In the future, the resolution will
probably also mean a certain amount of
media coverage for us.”

STAR’s next big project is a symposium
on racism and segregation this Sunday at
6:50 p.m. in the ballroom of the William
Pitt Union. The symposium will host two
panels, one made up of student-
organization representatives, and the other
of faculty and community leaders. Tamara
Horowitz, philosophy professor, and Gail
Austin of University Challenge for
Excellence Program will speak, along with
representatives from the Black Action
Society and the University Honors College
Advisory Cabinet. Giovine said that more

THE prrr NEWS, Wednesday, April 4, 1990

 

April 2 — A student in Trees
Hall reported to an officer that
she had been feeling very dizzy
and sick for the past three or four
days. The officer told her that she
looked pale and suggested she
go to the Student Health Service.
The student refused to go there
or to a hospital. Her friend said
that she would watch the student
and would call the police if other
problems occurred. The officer
dropped the girls off at the corner
of Fifth Avenue and Bouquet
Street, and the student was able
to walk unassisted to her dorm.

April 2 — Over the weekend,
an unknown person(s) entered
Room 501 of the Cathedral of
Learning and removed computer
equipment. There was no sign of
forced entry, but the custodian
reported that upon entering Room

501, he discovered that the trash
cans, with the liners missing, were
placed on the tables. Trash had
spewed all over the floor.

April 2 —— A student reported
that on Friday, her Pa. driver’s
license fell out of her coat pocket
while she was walking on Forbes
Avenue. No others items were
reported missing.

April 2 — A reporting officer
was dispatched to 219 Oakland
Ave. to check on someone
impersonating a plumber. The
complainant, a student, said that
a suspicious-looking male
knocked on her door and said he
was a plumber. She looked
through the peephole and asked
for I.D. When the male didn’t
reply, she called her husband
and asked him to come home
from work. When she looked

again, the man was gone. Her
husband arrived and said that he
hadn't seen any suspicious-
looking characters in the hallway.
After contacting Property
Management, it was established
that the man was not an
employee. The couple was
advised to contact the police if
this type of incident should
happen again.

April 2 —-— A student stated that
she left her purse in Room 137 of
the Cathedral of Learning. When
she returned nearly two hours
later, the student discovered that
her $340 Gucci purse had been
stolen. The student has no
insurance to cover the loss.

April 3 —~A system malfunction
caused a Tower B fire alarm on
the fifth ﬂoor to falsely activate.

By Linda Marie Micco
Staff Writer

Some mornings, 42-year-old
Raoul Rapneth leaves his urban
home unshaven, wearing dirty,
faded jeans and a scruffy ﬂannel
s.hirt, a bandanna tied around his
head. Before he gets into his car,
he shoves his hands under the
hood to get grime under his
fingernails.

Today his work is in a low-

income housing project. Rapneth
finds the group of men he has
been looking for. In a tense
moment, he lifts his shirt, baring
his chest and back, denying that
«Jae is wearing a “wire” or
concealed weapon. After they
are convinced that he is not a
narcotics officer, Rapneth coolly
bargains for a bag of cocaine.

But Raoul Rapneth is a narc -
one of the best in the city. If the
plan goes smoothly, Rapneth will
make several more “buys,’f pump
the men for new leads on other

an arrest. Later, he will testify in
court to ensure a conviction.

He moves with a seasoned ease
which comes from logging long
hours on the stormy drug fronts.
Rapneth has been battling crime
as a Pittsburgh police detective
for more than 20 years, nearly
halfofthem spent in the Narcotics
Division.

Starting as a plainclothes
detective, he handled a variety of
violent crimes, but became
frustrated as criminals repeatedly
escaped prosecution because
witnesses and victims refused to
cooperate with investigations.

“T 0 go to court and make a
case, I have to check with
witnesses, victims, different
persons that may be involved or
may be indirectly involved,”
Rapneth says, referring to the
legwork necessary for general
criminal convictions. “Quite often
they don't want to make
themselves accessible. That is very
frustrating.”

promotions and commendations,
the police chief offered Rapneth
a new job. He took it. Now, as a
narcotics detective, he no longer
has to rely on the court testimony
of eyewitnesses.

“In this line ofwork, you either
have the dope or you don’t,”
Rapneth says. While he is pleased
about the recent law which
mandates prison sentences for
anyone caught possessing
narcotics, it means he now must
testify nearly every day, unless
he is working undercover on a
long-term operation. He is often
called as an expert narcotics
witness.

“We deal primarily with buying
drugs,” he says. “In so doing,
we’ve become familiar with the
way [they are] packaged, the
prices, how [they are] sold, how
Ithey arel Secreted, and in some
cases, like crack, how [they are]
prepared and utilized after that.”

Working undercover, Rapneth
and his partners have bought
everything from prescription

barbiturates to China White, the
deadly synthetic drug, and have
made arrests every place from
jewelry stores to motorcycle—gang
bars, from softball fields and late
night restaurants to the projects.
“I go out to meet them on their
own turf,” he says. “They don’t
know I’m a police officer, other
than the informants, and we try
to beat ‘em at their own game.”
And if their arrest and
conviction record is any indication
of success, Rapneth and his
partners, Claudia Selerno and
Barry Fox, have been winning
the game. Their narcotics team is
among the most active on the
force, and according to Rapneth,
99 percent of those they arrest
plead guilty or are convicted with
his testimony. Nearly every week,

Their success may well stem
from their street-smart cockiness
and their readiness to try anything

circles — such as when he and
his partner Fox donned softball
uniforms and rolled in the dirt on
a playing field before entering a
local bar. When they ordered a
couple ofbeers, they looked like
they had just finished a game.

“You look the part, act the part
and talk the part, and a lot of
times it works,” Rapneth
emphasizes. “Whatever it takes
when we’re on the streets to
blend in — and withinvthe laws
—— is what we’ll do.

“When we go into a bar,” he
says, “if you buy a draft beer and
sit there and nurse it for an hour
— and you’re all eyes and ears -
you’re a cop whether you’re a
cop or not. One thing I’ve found
effective is to go in and order
three shots of my favorite
schnapps and drink the first before
he's done pourin’ the third.

“That usually takes the chill off,
right off the bat,” Rapneth says
heartily. “In fact, I did exactly that

THE PI'IT NEWS, Wednesday, April 4, 1990

 

Foreign student finds it's easy to get lost inthe crowd,

By David W. Matta
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
gladly took his tuition, but it was
unwilling to look out for his
welfare, according to one
international student.

Ozer K. Unal came to Pitt from
Ankara, Turkey, this past fall to
start his undergraduate education
in the United States. When he
came alone with little knowledge
ofPittsburgh or the United States,
he had an open mind about the
whole experience. Pitt, however,
abandoned him as soon as his
money was paid, he said.

“No one ever said anything to
me about being an international
student,” said Unal. “I just came
to Pitt, took some advanced-
placement tests, registered for
classes, and that was it.”

Even Unal’s adviser has not
recommended that he talk to
someone about what it is like to
be a foreigner at Pitt. No one ever
made it clear to him that there are
programs and organizations to
help international students adjust
to life at a major American
university.

Unal managed to complete the
fall term by himself, but the first

two months of the winter term
have not been as pleasant.

Because he does not know
where to meet other students
who have similar problems, Unal
spends most of his time alone in
his South Oakland apartment
watching television and ordering
out for food when he gets hungry.
He does not like going to classes
because he said they are boring,
and he is lost on campus.

“I do not like going to classes
because they are not fun, and I
do not have any friends on
campus,” he said.

Unal only attends classes where
attendance is required because
he is proﬁcient enough in his
other classes not to need
classroom instruction, he said.
He is majoring in civil engineering,
and most of his classes are math
and science courses.

He took an English—writing
course during the first term and
did not attend all of the classes.
He did, however, begin attending
every class after his instructor
warned him halfway through the
term.

No one had told him that

/ attendance is mandatory in some

classes. No one had told him how
the university works.

“I do not understand what is
going on at Pitt. No one explained
anything to me, and I wish that
someone had,” Unal said.

It is a difficult thing to be a
foreign student at an American
university in terms of making

 

friends and taking care of yourself
without anyone to help you.
However, Unal thinks that the
university that welcomes you
should be somewhat responsible
for making sure that you are
successfully adjusting to your new
environment.

“I thought someone would talk
to me when I came here. I came
after freshman orientation, and

no one told me about how the
university worked and what I
had to do.”

Students at Pitt take for granted
their knowledge and
understanding of many basic
things in society. To someone
from a foreign country,
however, these things are not
necessarily a part of everyday
life. Unal does not even know
where the Towers cafeteria is.
Most of the things about life at
Pitt that he does know are things
that he has picked up by himself
as the school year has
progressed.

Joan Lucas, adviser to foreign
students and scholars, said that
international students need to
come to the international-
students department, located on
the seventh floor of the William
Pitt Union, to get assistance.
Unal is now getting the attention
and information that he should
have gotten six months ago.

“At a large, urban university
there is an element of
independence an international
student must deal with,” Lucas
said.

“You have to look for help. If
you inquire about it, we will
help you.”

Following freshman orientation,
there is a special international—
students orientation in August.
Foreign students must also go to
the department before they can
register or do’ anything else to
begin school. They are all given a
handbook on programs and
activities available to them at Pitt.

There also exists an international-
students club, and applicable to
Unal’s particular case, a Turkish
Students Club. To find out about
these available resources, students
must go to the department.

“It is not a small school. They
have to come in to find out what
they can do,” Lucas said. “You cans»
get lost ifyou do not know enough
about the campus.”

Lucas said that the department
does everything in its power to
assist the approximately 300
international students enro; ;ed Pitt.
She said that she wished that they
could do more, but the funding
and personnel are not available.

“It is almost too big a task for us 47
to do. I wish we could do more for
them.”

- She did say that she thought that
a mentor system would be much
better, but she did not think it
would be an easy program to
organize.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, April 4, 1990 ~

Narc

Continued from page 3
were workin’ the Pagans
motorcycle gang. A man wearing
a leather jacket I had never seen
before slapped me on the back
and said, ‘Hey man, I like the
way you drink. Wanna buy some
coke?”

 The team conducts a narcotics-
investigation seminar based on
their techniques for police officers
in local precincts and all over the
country. “Our method is to buy
drugs rather than kick doors
down,” he says.

Many of the team’s arrests
evolve from tips from informants;
they are the lifeblood of Rapneth’s
work. Even after hours, Rapneth
sits within arm’s reach of the
black “snitch” hot line in his
home, which is off-limits to the
rest of the family. His beeper lies
close to him.

An informant once told him
that a jewelry—store owner was
pushing more than just emeralds
and rubies. The results of the

*[«.»investigation he and his partners

conducted suggested the
informant was right, so Rapneth
and his team went into action.
“We got one of our female
partners a bunch of scrap gold;
we got her a full—length white fox
coat. We got her a Jaguar. We
borrowed a two—carat diamond
ring from someone, else. You

‘know, just look the part.

“All she did was open her
purse, money and gold falling
out everywhere, and she just
gave the guy $300 worth of gold

and said ‘I want you to make this
into a coke snorter for me,’ to
break the ice, and it broke the ice
perfectly,” he adds.

“Anybody and everybody can
be an informant,” Rapneth says
of the few people in the drug
culture who know his true
profession. “We have irate wives,
irate husbands, jilted girlfriends,
jilted boyfriends, neighbors. But
what does an informant look like?
Take a look up and down the
street. I know you know an
informant. You may not know it,
but I know you do.”

Informants do not make his job
easy, though. In fact, he must
continually chase the
experienced, elusive informants
to wheedle useful information
from them. He works long hours
and puts himself at more risk
than the average cop to maintain
his edge over the drug trafﬁckers.

Hex prides himself on his
superior firearms ability. He says
that the best information comes
from the streets, from the addicts.
He is willing to hunt them down
because he wants to get drugs off
the streets.

“Number one, I’ve got kids,
and some of these gumballs
would sell drugs to them just as
soon as they'd sell them to
someone else,” he says.

His daughtervavoided drugs,
although she was offered them at
her inner-city high school. She
now works as a salesperson and
remembers that during her teen
years, her father showed her

videos about drug abuse.

“My dad did things with us like
a family, even though he didn’t
have much time,” she recalls.
Every Halloween, her father
carves the most intricate jack—o’—
lanterns in the neighborhood.

“Come Friday, no matter what’s
happenin’, I just cut the wire, and
I’m gone,” he says. Rapneth and
his family often escape from the
stress during weekends at their
mountain cottage, where they
enjoy hunting and fishing.

“My brother and I practiced
shooting BB guns practically
before we could even walk,” his
daughter says of her firearms-
conscious family. While at home,
they have shared the
responsibility over the years for
many strange pets, including a
tarantula, several raccoons,
rabbits, a German shepherd police
dog forced into early retirement
due to shyness, parakeets, snakes,
lizards, a chicken and Daisy the
skunk, among others.

Ultimately, Rapneth is trying to
lessen the effect of the crimes on
his family and others resufting

, from the sale of drugs. ‘‘I know

that everybody around here is a
victim of drug abuse,” he says.
“I do what I can to try to stop
it, to put these guys away.
Sometimes it makes a difference
as far as their personal life goes,
but that’s not my concern. My

concern is to get ‘em off the street

for as long as I can. For good if at
all possible, if warranted, and
that’s that.”

Sorority gets ‘canned
during cbozrity eﬂoﬂ

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

Five sisters of the Delta Delta Delta sorority were canning in front
of the South Hills Village Mall Friday and ended up getting cannec},4,
for it. ‘ »

They were collecting money in Upper St. Clair for St. Francis
Medical Center as part of Greek Week when they were cited by Upper
St. Clair police.

According to Lt. Douglas Burkholder of the Upper St. Clair Police
Department, the sorority members were cited for soliciting on a
highway, which he said was against the Pennsylvania highway laws.

“This is basically like giving them a citation for going through a red
light,” he said. “The fine is the same as well.”

Bethany Blakey, one of the sisters who was fined, said that a police

car had passed them 15 minutes before they were cited. “Five or 10“."‘*"

minutes later, another [police] car came up to us. Then another
[police] car came up to us, and [the officers] said that we were being
cited for solicitation,” she said. I

Blakey said that she was vague about the laws about solicitation.
“We've never had a problem before,” she said. “I don’t think that it
was solicitation as such. We were doing this for charity.”

She also said that she thought the Upper St. Clair police were
intolerant of the situation. “We were ﬁned $52.50,” she said. “If they
didn’t want us to can there, OK. I thought they were being intolerant.

“We would have left if they had asked us. I don’t know why they
gave us a ﬁne. Maybe they were being greedy and wanted the money
for their police station,” she added.

laws will depend on economic American military in drug

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Conservatives are often derided
by the liberal left for not giving a
hoot about the environment. There
is, on the surface, much evidence
to justify such an accusation. One
can read columns and cartoons by
conservative syndicates which are
derogatory toward the perils of the
environmental movement. How-
ever, what must be realized is that
the snide remarks by conserva-
tives are not aimed at those al-
ways-noble attempts to raise envi-
ronmental awareness but instead
at the baseless demagogues who,
without proper certiﬁcation, label
themselves “environmentalists.”

The tag “environmentalist”
should be applied to someone
who has had the proper training,
usually through schooling, in an
ecology-related area. But the
people with accredited degrees in
biology or physics are not com-
monly the ones that we see pro-
testing the use of nuclear energy or
other environmental matters. In-
deed, the protestors usually aren't
qualified to be protesting what
they are protesting. Thus, we
should differentiate the conven-
tional environmental "protestors
from those who are actually quali-
fied; the qualified people are
“environmentalists,” whereas the
unqualified people are “environ-
mental freaks."

Now, granted, there's nothing
“freaky” about having a concern
for the ecological condition of our
planet, but suspicion should cur-

Please accept these comments as
a response and perhaps as a small
lesson, but not as a defense of
Oliver Stone's movie Born on the
Fourth ofjuly, for which I share
Paul Kengor’s dislike. My concern
with Mr. Kengor’s March .29 tract
against the ﬁlm is not that he trashed
it, but that he did so in much the
same way that Stone made his
movie: with hyped-up emotional
stridency and a bit of naivete. Both

' Mr. Stone and Mr. Kengor seem to

think their audiences are stupid,
and that bothers me.

Mr. Kengor writes: “The latest
canonized Hollywood director/
mythomaniac, Oliver Stone, is trying
to rewrite history to further his
claim that the Unitedlstates is a
‘fascist state.”’ I would ask Mr.
_Kengor to entertain the idea that a
“state” is by nature “fascist.” From
the great Western democracies to
the “people’s republics” of com-
munism, a few powerful men make
decisions for the many, usually in
consult with people who have a lot
of money. Mr. Stone needn’t go
too far out on an ideological limb
to make that case, andthough it’s

an arguable idea, as all ideas are, ‘

it’s hardly reason to call Stone a
“mythomaniac.” That sort of silly
language discredits the writer more
than it discredits the target of his
writing.

Mr. Kengor’s insistence upon

“truth” in fiction films is surpris-,,,

ingly naive. He holds up the 1941

film Sergeant Yorle as an example > .

tail the causes that environmental

freaks (to be polite, I’ll refer to
them as the environmental move-
ment) rally behind. A study by the
National Science Foundation found
that a large percentage of Ameri-
cans think that DNA is a food
additive, Chernobyl is a ski resort,
and 36 percent think that radioac-
tive milk can be ‘made safe by
boiling. According to the survey,

    

Pal
Kengor

fewer than 6 percent of American
adults can be considered scientifi-
cally literate. Jon Miller, director of
the Public Opinion Laboratory of
Northern Illinois University, states-
that “Only about one in 20 adults
know enough about science to
function effectively as a citizen and
consumer when asked to help
formulate public policy about is-
sueslike nuclear power or toxic
-waste.” .

Such a formulation by Miller leads

of la movie] from the “good old
days.” (I hope he intended to use
that cliche ironically.) But the only
thing “true” about Sergeant York is
that the central character actually
existed. The film is what it is: an
argument for being both a Chris-
tian and a soldier. It is not, how-
ever, history.

In making Born on the Fourth of
July, Mr. Stone fabricated events to
portray the world in a particular
way. Mr. Kengor objects to the
fabrication of a scene in which
Syracuse police break up an anti-
war demonstration with clubs. The
event, we now know, did not “really

us to perhaps the grandest display
of ignorance by the environmental
movement, the one which has had
the most profound impact and
probably has irreparably crippled
its reputations and clout: its relent-
less battles against the use of nu-
clear power.
“No Nukes!” has been the battle
cry of the wandering debris of
causeless ’60s—generation protestors
who lug their innocent, impres-
sionable 5-year-old children (un-
aware of the embarrassment that
their parents are causing them)
behind them as they carry, “Save
the Whales” signs and sport “Give
Peace a Chance”-decorated jean
jackets from anti-war, pot-smok-
ing, love-in days gone by. (“Hell,
no! Seabrook must go!”) One is
inclined to. wonder whether these
people realize that the other en-
ergy alternatives to nuclear power,
such as burning oil and coal, are
far less cost-efficient and much
more polluting than nuclear en-
ergy. Also, coal mining poses a
tremendous health risk —- black
lung, anyone?
There has never been an actual

nuclear “meltdown” in this coun-~

try; the Three Mile Island near-
meltdown was prevented by the
cooling—system technology that
promised to do so. Not a single
person in this country has died as
a result of the Three Mile Island
accident or any other nuclear dis-
aster. Furthermore, without nuclear
power we are forced to rely on oil

happen” in Syracuse as depicted in
the film. But did some police
somewhere ever beat protestors
with clubs? And if not, what is
Stone saying about . government/
. citizen relations by fabricating such
a scene? I hope Mr. Kengor can
come to realize that when you
watch a fiction film, you must ask
yourself: What if this happened?
That’s why they call it “fiction.”

Films like Born on the Fourth of

July only claim to be “based on a
true story.” Anyone who accepts
them as the gospel truth should
probably consider investing in
Florida swampland.

An Environmental Conservativis m: Part I

supplies from the hostile and tur-
bulent Middle East, which requires
a U.S. military presence to guaran-
tee their transportation. It's ironic
that the environmental movement,
which is integrated with the peace
movement, also calls for cuts in the
U.S. military arsenal. However, we
literally can’t afford to make those
military cuts because they are
necessary in protecting the Middle
East oil which we require because
of the adamant opposition by the
No Nukes! movement.

The end result of the efforts of
the No Nukes! crowd is an unnec-
essary U.S. reliance on inefficient
means of energy. This reliance
breeds not only tax increases,
higher military costs and risks, oil
and energy crises, Exxon Valdez
and other oil spills and old—fash-

ioned U.S. industries which lie

dormant in competing with Japa-
nese technology, but paradoxically,
more pollution-causing alternatives
such as coal and oil — the ecologi-
cally damaging pollutants the
environmental movement seeks to
eradicate.‘ .

It is precisely this type of glaring
ignorance that gives the‘ environ-
mental movement a bad name in
the eyes of conservative Republi-
cans, Conservatives are not op-
posed to helping the environment;
they are against uninformed and
ignorant groups that claim they are
supporting it.

Legalization only solution in War on Drugs...

The subject of drug legalization
has recently been getting a lot of at-
tention in the news media. How-
ever, the term “drug re-legaliza-
tion” is a much more ﬁtting name.
Believe it or not, drugs weren’t
always illegal. In fact, during most
of the existence of this nation, there
weren’t any laws at all that made
any drugs illegal.

During the 19th century, people
took drugs such as heroin and
cocaine whenever they so desired.
There was no crime or violence
associated with it. Those who chose
to take drugs did so peacefully.

Around the turn of the century,
people started to realize the ill
effects of such drugs. As more and
more people became aware of this,
they simply stopped using them.

However, some government ofﬁ—
cials decided that that wasn't
enough, and they wanted laws
against these harmful drugs. In May
of 1906, the first federal drug law
was passed: the District of Colum-
bia Pharmacy Act. This law was
enacted to protect pharmacists from
the competition of other sellers of
drugs. Later on, tighter controls
were passed, and eventually the
dangerous drugs were banned.

Over time, enforcement of the
drug laws has become stronger and
stronger. This has caused drug prices .

to shoot up tremendously. Cocaine ’

that would cost perhaps $2 if legal

costs $200 today.

Because dr/ugs are so expen-
sive, many addicts cannot afford
to support their habits just from
the money they make at work. In

Alman

order to finance their addictions,
many turn to crime. They steal
cars, burglarize homes and mug
little old ladies in the streets. If

you have ever been a victim of I

such a crime, it is quite likely that
the thief wanted money for drugs.

People don’t commit crimes to
get cigarettes or alcohol. Being
legal, these things are relatively
cheap. In addition, people who
sell these things don’t go around
killing each other with machine
guns.

Overdoses on illegal drug pres-
ently kill thousands of_ people a

year. Because they are illegal, the
user does not.know how strong the
drugs are. For example, a user of
cocaine might think that it is 2-
percent pure, when it is actually
10—percent pure. He ends up tak-
ing five times as much as he had
originally intended to take and dies
from the overdose. Our drug laws
are probably the single biggest
reason why people overdose on
drugs.

Similarly, contaminated drugs
abound. For example, the person
who buys marijuana illegally does
not know whether or not it is laced
with other drugs such as PCP.

During alcohol prohibition in the
1920s, many people died from
ingesting poisonous alcohol. There
was also a lot of crime involved
with alcohol. Alcohol dealers were
running around killing each other
and innocent bystanders. When
alcohol prohibition was repealed,
all of this ended.

Currently, one of the biggest
problems with illegal drugs is that
they are being sold in schools. It is
interesting to note that we don’t
have cigarette dealers or beer
dealers in schools; we just have
drug dealers. Re-legalizing dmgs
would get these dealers out of the
schools.

At present, people are realizing
that alcohol and cigarettes are very
dangerous things. Because they are

legal, the market is responding,
very well with safer versions of
them, such as wine coolers and
low-tar cigarettes. ,

With illegal drugs, the exact
opposite is happening. Crack,

China White and “ice,” which I

have all appeared only in the past
several years, show that in an
illegal marketplace, the quality of
the product often becomes worse.

Thousands of heroin users have
gotten AIDS from shooting up
with contaminated needles. Dia-
betics use the same kinds of
needles, but they don’t get AIDS
from them. If heroin were legal,

and if it were legal for non- .

diabetics to purchase needles,
then nobody would ever getAIDS
from shooting heroin.

There is a very simple reason
why drug prohibition doesn’t
work. In a free society, a person
should be able to put whatever
he or she wants into his or her
body. Drug prohibition goes
against this freedom. The more
the drug lawsare enforced, the
worse the problems get. lt’s like
throwing gasoline on a fire.

Re-legalizing drugs, that is,
giving each person the freedom
to choose what to do with his or
her own body, is something that
needs to be done.

...unless increases in drug crimes are a solution.

The two arguments most impor-
tant to the Libertarian position that
drugs should be legal are the be-
liefs that drug use is a liberty and
that the current epidemic of crime
in drug-infested neighborhoods is
related to the price of drugs and not
its use. Both arguments are ﬂaccid:
Drug addiction is fundamentally
dangerous to a free society.

Drug use is not a liberty that one
enjoys because “I own my body,”
to quote an avid Libertarian. The V

. right to ingest substances ends if it

interferes with someone else’s lib-
erty. Moreover, liberty is a mean-
ingless term unless we are talking
about rational individuals. To para-
phrase John Mill, society does not
grant liberty to madmen or chil-
dren —— because they are not ca-

pable of deciding what is best for
them. So a free society reserves the
right to proscribe actions or condi-
tions that interfere with individual
liberty. Drug use is such an action.

Daniel
Brawdy

First, an individual under the
inﬂuence of drugs is not in control
of his actions. A drug addict is
under the control of the drug.
Studies on adolescents and addicts
indicate that those who are likely
to become addicted have a history

«of psychological disturbances.

For drugs that are illegal, the

make things up. Life becomes
much more rewarding when I
challenge myself to find mean-
ing in the ﬁctional narrative

. events I'm presented rather than
bitching about what “really"
happened. If I want to know the
“truth,” I’ll read a history or watch
a documentary.

Let me say it again: Mr. Stone
was wrong, wrong, wrong to
insult moviegoers by thinking
they couldn’t be moved by a
more accurate representation of
Kovic’s life. But I didn’t know
about Mr. Stone’s. historical inac-
curacies when I saw the film. I
loathed it for other reasons en-
tirely.

Both Mr. Stone and Mr. Ken-

gor are so married to their no-
tions of right and wrong that
they seem to have lost all per-
spective as artists. My political
views are liberal/left, but I'm
turned off by liberal films ——
like Born on the Fourth of July
— that use emotional-assault
techniques to convince view-
ers of [their points] of view.
From Stone to Rambo Stallone,
the technique is the same, and
it’s insulting to an audience.
Moviegoers are not partners in
projects like these. They are
victims; they are being brain-
washed and theyare too often
unwilling to stand up for them-
selves.[...l

than that of alcohol. For drug users,
the primary reason for taking the
drug is intoxication. According to a
Scientific American article on mor-
phine, “Addiction seems to arise
only in some fraction of users who
take the drug for its psychological
effects, such as its ability to pro-
duce euphoria.” In addition, the
addictive potential of a drug ap-
pears related to the strength of its
intoxication. Crack, for example,
causes a much better high. It is also
much more addictive. V

A free society has the right to
curb the use of substances which
are physically addictive or mood
altering. This right stems from a
free societyls interest in ensuring
that every individual is capable of
making decisions and taking care
of himself or herself. Intoxication
temporarily removes the ability to
think rationally. Addiction to a
mood—altering drug completely
eliminates it.

Drugs such as cocaine and her-
oin are powerfully addictive. More
than 70 percent of first-time users
become addicted. Crack and “ice”
(a heroin derivative analogous to
crack) are even more addictive. By
comparison, only about 10 percent
of first-time users of alcohol be-
come alcoholics. And the “fact” that
drug prices are artiﬁcially high
because they are currently illegal is
not a fact at all but an opinion on
the state of the underground mar-
ket for drugs. Crack is made with a
very cheap and pure form of co-
caine — and it can be made at
home with some baking soda and
a typical kitchen pan. How much

cheaper can the process get? What
evidence is therethat prices will
come down?

Widespread drug use is a pre-
scription for social ruin. After pro-
hibition was repealed, alcohol
consumption tripled. Legalizing

drugs now would legitimize their ‘’

use. Consumption would increase,

and the violence would not de— y I

crease. .
The violence associated with
drug use is not related to the

price. Many of those killed by \

drug gangs in Los Angeles are
killed in drive-by shootings; gang
members drive by and shoot

innocent bystanders _to “mark I

territory.” If one pauses and re-
ﬂeets on why a dealer would kill
an addict who owes him a great
‘deal of money, it is obvious that
money isn’t really the issue. And
to reiterate a very important point:
Most addicts have a history of
psychological disturbance.

Drug abuse is not about the
“choice” to get high. It is not a
liberty that one has because, “I
own my body." The widespread
drug abuse and violence in the
inner-city ghetto are a product of
poverty and social sickness.

Drug use and its illegality has
been compared to Prohibition,

and many prominent politicians \

and advocates have spoken out
in favor of legalization.’But drug
use is not comparable to alcohol
use; it is much more serious. Drug
legalization is an overextension
of liberty, and it is one of the
actions that a free society needs
to proscribe to survive.

Distance runners not-so-lonely at this university

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

The loneliness of the long— distance runner won’t be a problem for
the Pitt Panthers’ track team at the Intercollegiate Association of

‘ Amateur Athletes of America Championships. That’sbecause three

Panther distance runners will make the trip to Yale University, having
qualified last weekend for the meet May 19 through 20. The IC4A,
stretching from Maine to North Carolina and as far west as Indiana,
has 110 member schools.

Keith Dowling (14: 15.46) and Scott Humphrey (14:22.00) qualiﬁed
in the 5,000—meter run, and Paul Friedrich (9:11.54) qualified in the
steeplechase. Humphrey also expects to qualify in the 10,000, in
which he qualified last year.

“Now that we’ve qualiﬁed, it takes a lot of pressure off of us for the
rest of the season,” Dowling said. “Now we can concentrate on
strategy together.” .

Men’s track coach John Vasvary said he is not looking for the trio
to reach a certain mark at the IC4As.

“I just want them to run the best race that they can. You really can't
put any stipulation on any kind of time,” Vasvary said. “If you’re a
football coach, you don’t ask your quarterback to throw 200 yards,
you ask him to play well enough to win.”

The three runners agreed that the IC4As are more for individual
than team performances, compared to the Big East Championships,
so the trio had some more specific goals.

“I’d like to finish in the top three; I think that's pretty realistic,” said
Dowling, who finished seventh last year in the 5,000 run. “Our
ultimate goal is to qualify for the national championships at the end
of May. We’re off to a good start, and to be a national—caliber runner,
you should at least score at IC4As.” _

“I’d just like to go there and score,” said Humphrey. “Last year was
my first year that I ran all three seasons [cross country, indoor track
and outdoor track], and I was tired. I just wanted to get done.”

The three contribute their success this spring to having an excellent
indoor season during the winter. ’

“Last year, I trained in longer, slower miles,” Humphrey said. “I’d
run five [miles] and try to make each about 4:45 to 4:48. This year I’m
only running three, but I’m trying for 4:30 instead. So I ’m going more
for quality instead of quantity." 0 .

“I had a good winter,” said Dowling, “landl except for one time, I've
had my personal best in every race since January. I’ve been a lot more
consistent, and I get good support from Scott [Humphrey] and Paul
[Friedrich].”

Panther Rowing Club christens four new shells

By John Iabriola
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh's
rowing club , christened four
racing shells this past weekend.

In an elaborate presentation,
the rowing club brought out the
shells one at a time.

The first of the four shells

christened was named Richard A

Follett after the father ‘of the
rowing club’s first women’s coach,
Kendra Follett. The RichardFollett
is the rowing club’s oldest boat.

“We are very proud , but he
would be so honored and proud
that the women’s team thought
that much of him to name a boat
after him, " said Mrs. Donna Follett.

The second of the shells
christened was named Richard
D. Day after the club’s faculty
advisor. Day has been the club’s
adviser for the past year and has
been rowing for about a year and
a half.

“They are great kids," said Day,
“and they have given me a chance
to work together with them
building up the club, which has
been really important.”

With their third shell, the crew
team honored Wesley W. Posvar,
president of the university, by
naming that shell after him. Posvar

was once an avid crewman at
Oxford University.

“I've supported the rowing club
since I first heard of Iitl,” said
Posvar. “It's a natural for
Pittsburgh because of the rivers,
and I think that rowing is one of
the finest sports in intercollegiate
athletics." .

“I think this is a great success.
We’re probably going to have the
best rowing club in the area, and
it’s just the beginning,” added
Posvar.

"When Posvar was asked
whether he felt that the rowing
club should become a varsity

sport, he said that is something
that only time will tell.

“I don't really think that it makes
that much difference,” he said,
“because a successful club sport
with committed volunteers
accomplishes exactly the same
thing.” '

Posvar continued by saying that
rowing is really for its members

.and its participants. It is also not

much of a spectator sport, except
on special occasions.

The Wesley W. Posvar as well
as the Richard Follett are shells
for the women’s crew team and
will be raced as such. When asked

how he felt about having a boat
named in his honor, Posvar
replied:

“Of course I'm deeply honored.
I hope it goes faster than all of the
others. I am delighted to see that
my crew also is women.”

The Student Government Board
was instrumental in the
acquisition of both of the Richard
D. Day and the Wesley W. Posvar.

The fourth and final boat
christened on Saturday was the
rowing club’s ﬂagship, the Adella
V. Sidehamer: This shell is named

for the grandmother of Todd A

Ridenour, the club’s ex-president.

Sidehamer donated the necessary 
funds needed to purchase the A 

shell.

Each of the racing shells, 
including oars, costs about $8,000. "

The rowing! club also has

purchased two cox boxes. Kehm 

explains that a cox box is a

microphone with a display (an 
inter-boat public—address system), I

and it also has a performance
meter that registers the strokes

perlsecond, elapsed time and I

strokes taken. They cost $550
each.

The National League West
should prove to be the most
interesting in all of baseball. The

. Giants are always questioned

about pitching and then at the
end of the season, they are
questioned about how they won
.__more than 85 games. The Reds
have a new manager in Lou
Pinella. The Padres trader, Jack
McKeon, has again participated
in the trade shows for 1990. The
Dodgers have the pitching. The
question lies with the ability of
0 manager Tom Lasorda to keep

stood pat, but that could prove to
 be the wisest move. The Braves,

Tony Gwynn, Jack Clark and

one of the best lineups in the

he took at the hands of the World
Champion Athletics last October
for the Giants to finish at the top.
Don Robinson, Kelly Downs and
Mike LaCoss round out the staff.
The hitting is no problem with
Will the Thrill Clark at first, MVP
Kevin Mitchell in left and Brett
Butler in center. Faces to watch
will be Don Robinson (Can he
recover from knee surgery again?)

The Houston Astros are the
same team that ﬁnished last year,
minus Bass. The pitching staff is
led by Mike Scott. He could
definitely win the Cy Young
Award. Jim Deshaies, Bill

Gullickson, Jim Clancy and Mark 0

Portugal round out_ the starting
staff. Dave Smith will continue to
be the most unsung stopper in
the NL. The hitting is coming
along. Glenn Wilson was acquired
at the end of the year to provide
first baseman Glenn Davis and
catcher Craig Biggio with lineup
protection. Eric Anthony could
be a superstar in this league. Last
year, he hit homeruns that may
still be in orbit.

The Los Angeles Dodgers are
deep in the outfield, but that may
be the place where they have the
most problems. The pitching staff

compares well with the Angels, ,

Mets and Royals. Orel Hershisher,
Tim Belcher, Fernando
Valenzuela, Ramon Martinez and
John‘ Wetteland, along with
stopper Jay Howell could push
the Dodgers to the top. The
outfield is a question, with Kal

Daniels in left, Juan Samuel or
John Shelby in center, with Kirk
Gibson and Hubie Brooks in right.
Gibson is still hurting; Brooks
wants back in theinfield, as does
Samuel. Lasorda has to be very
careful with the ego of these
players; otherwise, he’ll be yelling
“Look out below.” Faces to watch
will be Willie Randolph (Can he
hold on to his second-base job?),
Jim Gott (Can he help this club
like he did with the Pirates?) and
Valenzuela (Can he continue his
tough path back to his old
stature?) .

The Atlanta Braves are for
real. Barring" injury, they could
possibly see .500 for the first time
in many moons. They have the
best young pitching staff. Led by
John Smoltz, they are a staff that
has been together for two seasons
and has learned together. If GM
Bobby Cox can continue to help
the offense and defense without
trading away too much pitching,
the Braves will win the NL West at
least twice in the ’90s. After Smoltz,
Tom Glavine is the one to look at
along with Pirate John Smiley, as
the two best young 1eft—handed
pitchers in the NL. With the
addition of Ernie Whitt behind
the plate, the staff should be able
to gain even more knowledge on
what it takes to win. Additions to
the team were Nick Esasky at
first, Whitt at catcher and Jim
Presley at third. Those three, along
with Lonnie Smith and a happy

- Perhaps the most overlooked
coaching performance in all of
college basketball was the one
turned in by Clem Haskins of

Minnesota. Four years ago,
Haskins inherited a program
mired in total disarray and
controversy, one that the
university itself even
contemplated shutting down
temporarily.

Haskins has taken it to the
Final 16 the past two seasons.

-What is really the biggest
waste of time? Why, TV sports
journalism. All these people really
do is sit in front of their big
screens and criticize. So—and—so
pronounced this guy's name
wrong. This guys predictions
were way off Musburger didn’t

cry when he was signing off for

should do is have a weekly
segment which criticizes the print

media, show ‘em how it feels. (Of .

course, it’s probably the most
