 MC Calls For%Camlpus Po

 

Wants Student Political
Cluhs Sanctioned '.

By JOAN LISOTTO
The inﬂux of Taft buttons and Eisenhower banners on
other college campuses has stirred Men’s Council to action.

It passed a unanimous resolution Tuesday recommending .

that the University sanction the organization of national poli-

tical clubs on campus.

Dan Purdy who pro osed the resolution stated that the
clubs should be permitte on the basis of the student’s right

as a citizen. Purdy continued,
“The University does not have to
aid the clubs ﬁnancially, but
should recognize their existence
and permit their operation on
campus.’’
. Chances Slim--Biddle

According to Theodore W. Bid-
dle, dean of men, the probability
of their recognition is very slim.

Dean Biddle stated that polit-
ical clubs have never been per-
mitted on campus because the
University is not responsible for
any outside groups.

Dean Biddle continued, “The
University: is state endowed and
cannot show any political partial-
ity. Any political organization per-
mitted on campus would subject
the University to criticism as a
prejudiced institution.”

However Men’s Council is per-

mitted to submit its proposal to
the Student Organizations Com-
mittee which will render ﬁnal
decision.
Always Opposed

This long-standing committee,
composed of faculty members, has
turned down every political club
which has asked recognition. They
have in former years denied The
Young Republicans, The Young
Democrats and The Young Pro-
gressives any approval.

Phil Feinert, who seconded Pur-
dy’s proposal, said that the Uni-
versity is too conservative on its
viewpoints and should drop its
old fashioned attitudes and become
a modern institution.

Pope Selects Lynch,

lead roles of the next Pitt Player’s production, “You Touched
Me,” it was announced today by Director Harvey J. Pope.

iiCancer Grants Speed Work ’

Pitt is rapidly becomingone of the most important cen-

e ters for cancer research in the nation. ,

Working under grants from such sources as the Damon
Runyon ‘Fund, the Atomic Energy. Commission, and the Amer-
.ican Cancer Society, Pitt scientists are approaching the

problem of curing cancer from both the lamoratory and the
clinical points of view. . .

\

Projects range from the clinical treatment of leukemia

‘to investigation of the use of radioactive isotopes for the

treatment of lung cancer. . ~-
S Varied Projects

A summary released by the American Cancer
shows the following projects under way:

1) Dr. William M. Cooper, Working through the Addison
H. Gibson Laboratory, has been studying the effects of radio-

Society

active phosphorus in the treatment of various types of

leukemia and polycythemia. 168 cases of cancer have been

treated with these isotopes in this area in'the last few months; ’

Material ‘has been provided‘ by the Atomic Energy‘ Com-
mission.

 

 

RESEARCH—Dr. Francis  Cheever, professor of microbiology,
prepares a slide hemoglutination test on chick embroyos. Pitt has

Danowski Optimistic

In connection with his Work,
Dr. Danowski recently expressed
the opinion that research was get-
ting close to the cause of cancer.

Speaking before the state board
of directors of the American Can-
cér Society, Dr. Danowski said:
“When” you can interefere with
the growth of (cancerous) tum-
ors with such a wide variety of
(chemical) agents, you can’t help
feeling that you are getting-close
to the cause of the disease.”

   1.124 T rim:

The various Universal Military Training
bills which have been ﬂoating around in

:Washington committees for the past ﬁve
years, loom as one of the greatest threats

.‘ to the American way of life yet conceived.

f The avowed aim of these bills is to pro-
vide the country with a large reservoir of
trained personnel in the event of a large scale

"war. As planned UMT to Would serve as a
substitute for the draft laws.

_ The advantage of UMT over the draft
' laws is held, to be its continuity which would
‘be uninterrupted by changes in the inter-

national situation and in the political climate.

 Once enacted UMT would be part of the

7 American pattern. - ‘ .

e The bill will, in ‘effect, legislate militar-
ism into the American way of life. It is im-
possible to conceive that the six months in-
doctrination course for every 18-year-old
will not have an effect on our national atti-
tude towards the military.

The argument that exposure to the army
will turn Americans away from the uniform-
ed life is not borne out by the reaction after

3 the last war. Every veteran swore he would
never put a uniform on again, but look at
the American Legion and the VFW.

The enactment of UMT will give the mili-
tary,a role which no other branch of society
enjoys, except education. They will be able
to get across their ideals and aims to every
single youth in the country. Many of them

-will fall for it. . ‘

The cost of the program is incalcuable and
for those whoare worried about taxes, here
is another worry. » T

Finally, six months training is not even
remotely adequate for the highly technical
art of war. The only possible justiﬁcation
for the program is that it will indoctrinate
the troops. “ , —

If we are to use history as a guide, UMT
will certainly create a spirit of militarism
and ‘a large vocal support for it.

The bill should be enacted into law and
asstudents we should make this clear to the
legislators. We can do so by writing to our

T local representatives.’ ‘

  Ain't we Pure?

The Athletic,Department saw fit ‘recently to re-
’ lease the names of two freshman basketball play-
'ers wholwere dropped. from the Universitygbecause
.. of poor grades. ’  c
, In effect, the department was_s,ayin_g, “Hey, hey,
ain’t we the pure ones? Yes sir, if our brawn boys
don’t match their muscles with their mentals we
won’t let ’em play on our team.”
Big Time is Coming _

Just who the hell does the Athletic Department"
think it is, kidding? Tom Hamilton andCom-
pany are on the premises to elevate the Univer-
sity’s athletics to major-league status, and publi-
cizing the fact that a couple embryo basketball
players couldn’t make the grade strikes me as be-
ing both lousy taste and a personal affront to the
boys involved.

Let’s not delude ourselves. Ever since Hamil-
ton and his growing parade of professional brush-
beaters arrived on campus, the search for sports
stalwarts had been on.- Granted, the Captain has
observed certain boundaries: he has not gone west
of the flockies or south of Cuba for football play-
ers. This stands as a wise move; it removes the
possibility of bi-lingual difﬁculties.

A Personally, I’m all for this talent grab. My only
complaint concerning the football and basketball
picture at Pitt during the past decade is that we
failed to buy players of Maryland-Kentucky-
Michigan State calibre. In football, this, plus
scheduling that made most of the games look like.
mass suicide pacts on Pitt’s part, led to the thrash-
ings our teams absorbed.

Character Building?‘

Athletic directors spend part of their time as-
suring the public that out of athletics comes char-
acter building. I

Well, it looks like someone in the high com-
mand dropped the ball when they put the pan on

serious than ﬂunking out of school. '

A Plan for Action

JACK MARKOWITZ

This is about brotherhood, or
at least a corollary of it, and I
do not have a right to expect
many readers. Brotherhood has
been sold too much, and the law
of diminishing returns operates
nowhere as relentlessly as in the
ﬁeld of moral ‘
ideas. _

will ever agree anymore to beta I

Fourth of July orator?
Brotherhood is the same way.

No speaker can” face an audience‘
without some kind of a trick-
apology for the vague triteness

of speaking about brotherhood.
Yet each believes that his own

statement is new and important,

and that lt‘Ii‘light inspire some

‘action, from his listeners if all '

the»other hack speakers had just
shut up and not spoiled thei audi-
ence. I . ’
Brotherhood Essential?

iMy own opinion is that. all
change in the morality of ".the

audience need not be depended
upon to ‘prove the effectiveness
of brotherhood week. ' .

Anyone who believes that a
material improvement in the re-
lations, between races and relig-

ion is dependent upon the birth

of a feeling of brotherhood is on
the wrong track. ' 5
The week can. be effective in

the material action, if not in the

morality,‘ that it inspires.

I cannot condemn those who
end this week with a remnant of
religious and racial‘ bias still
within them. Prejudice is not a
thing that can be eradicated with
reason alone; bias is seated more

_deeply than in the cerebrum.

Blood Facts _

And the mere’ anthropological
data that there is no difference in
the blood of different races-and
that George Washington Carver,
Mordecai Caplan, and Fulton

A Sheen have contributed some-
‘ thing to American civilization-

is not enough to eradicate the
prejudice‘ that lies far beneath
the surface. '

Here is the point: Prejudice
does not need to’ be swept
away for us to act;

It seems to me that our hope
lies, not in-loving our, neighbor
as ourself, but in realizing, in-
tellectually, that we should love
our neighbor as ourself.

And..we will make that realiza-
tion mean something by seeing
to it, under law, that our unfor-
tunately ineradicable prejudices
do not ruin the ,lives and oppor-
tunities of those we are prejudic-
ed against.

Here at school, Student Con-
gress can legitimately work to-
ward the removal of racial and
religious questions from applica-
tions, for entrance into the
schools of the University.

7 The practical task before us
and the task very feasible of
accomplishment — is to levy
legal restrictions up our op-
portunities to gratify our
prejudices.

Though prejudice remains,
progress can be made.

Pitt T 0 Play Host to Olympic Triais  

A
V’

 

By DON SCHURMAN

The 1952 summer Olympics
——at least in part--is coming
to the Field House early in
April.

After two weeks of negotiating
with Olympic ofﬁcials, wrestling
Coach Rex Peery and Athletic Di-
rector Tom Hamilton today signed
a contract to hold the regional
Olympic wrestling tryouts at the
Field House on April 9-10.

There are eight other such tour-
nament sites in the United States
although Olympic ofﬁcials are at
present trying to contract six
more. The only other sites in the

East are at Princeton, N. J.; Dav-
idson, N. Car-.; Toledo, Ohio; and
Chicago.
Finals at Iowa

So far, only Penn State and

Waynesburg have promised to send

-their Olympic aspirants to the

Field House regionals. Other dis-
trict schools are expected to do the
same, however, because of the con-
venience of the location.

The two ﬁnalists in each weight
division from the regional tryouts
are eligible to enter the ﬁnal tour-
ney on April 18-19 at Ames, Iowa.
There the U.S. Olympic mat team
is chosen.

By GEORGE MEHAFFEY
Pitt’s Frosh-JV hoopsters

thirteen on Wednesday night ,

and came out on the losing end,
56-53.

Coach Edgar Jones’ proteges
went into the home ﬁnale seeking
their e1eventh’victory in thirteen

JV’s had other ideas, namely to
avenge an early season Pitt win,
54-45 on the Tech ﬂoor.

Lose 8-Point Lead
The Jungle Cubs led, 47-39, at

the close of the third stanza, but 1

blew the comparatively safe mar-
gin to the aroused plaid quintet in
the closing moments.

Phil J eske, Tech freshman from
Ferguson, Miss. paced the visitors
with 15 points. Teammate Bill
Dosey followed with 13 tallies.

Jumping Joe Resutek shared

The 1951-52 edition of the Pan-

Artman’s Pitt freshman ﬁve of last
season.

The Jungle Cubs will have their
last chance to improve on that
record when they journey to Mor-
gantown tonight to engage the
Mountaineer JV ’s. Last season
Artman’s dribblers were able to
gain an even split in two encounters
with the perennially powerful
West Virginians.

Financially, all proceeds from
the Field House tournament will
go toward paying the $18,200 ex-
pense of sending the U.S. mat
team to Helsinki. But the selec-
tion of the Field House as a re-
gional post is nevertheless a big
boost to local wrestling.

Break for Pitt

“Besides building up local in-
terest,” says Peery, “it will put
Pittsburgh on the national wrest-
ling map. Now we can also en-
ter our whole team in the tryouts
at very little expense.”

Previously, Peery had intended

to Send only  l‘nOSt 0utStandingyente1~ as rnany Candidates as he
Cafldldates t0 the T019110 I‘€gi0Y131S ' chooses. The cost for each wrestler

because of traveling expenses.

After concluding their regular‘

season at West Virginia tomorrow,
Peery’s matmen will devote at
least part of their practice sessions
to the Olympic style of wrestling,
which diﬁers considerably from

 

the intercollegiate version. l  '

however, Pitt is scheduled for en-

charged to the defense.

rather than the coaches.” And
that’s easily explained. When a
basketball team loses its key play-
ers through needless fouls, the
coach’s plans are ruined.~ And he
becomes a ‘slave’ to the official.

In a recent Duquesne game the
Dukes made 30 of 40 foul’conve'r-
sions. Good shooting, yes, but it
showed that the opposition in try-
ing to stop the Dukes had to foul.

With Duquesne controlling the
boards v its opposition takes to
the defense and with the local
oﬁicials giving all the breaks to
the offense, the opposition be-
comes a ‘slave’ to the whistle
tooter.

In the Midwest fewer fouls are
called because the ofﬁcials believe
in a race—horse type of game. The
defense is given the break, result-
ing in a faster game and a ore
entertaining evening for the spec-
tators. . . ,

Apparently Carlson likes this
style. After the Notre Dame game
he commented, “We had the best
oﬁicial I’ve seen in years. I’ve al-
ready rated him as excellent -on
the Western Conference rating
card.” Incidentally only 36 fouls
were shot in the Pitt-Irish tilt.

Fins Engage Columbia, Army
  In New York Appearance 1

Coach Ben Grady and his charges are in for a rough

weekend.

The Pitt tankers, looking for their sixth straight win, are
eastbound for New York City where they’ll take on Columbia‘
tonight. And tomorrow they move to West Point to meet a _

highly—favored Army crew.

“We don’t expect too much trouble from Columbia,” says

Grady, “but we’ll need the breaks:

  Ten Thinclads ‘

to beat Army.”
Columbia Weak
This is not a mere guess on the

.1 coach’s part, but the result‘ of
shrewd calculations from the sheet

ofup-to-date individual and team
records which he keeps at his ﬁn-
gertips. Swimming is a science to
Grady. p “

But it doesn?t take a scientist to
ﬁgure why Pitt should be favored
over the Ivy Leaguers; the anemic
2-5-1 record of the latter attests
to that. Their only strong man is

Student Homesick for Flat Lands

BY JOHN De NINNO

Although Jan Links, a 29

A
V’

year old research student in

bio-physics, is very fond of America, he is a bit homesick

for his family and hometown.

He came to Pitt from Leiden, Holland, where the land is

so ﬂat people travel by bicycle?

and, in winter, by ice skates on
the canals. _ 1

Jan is studying here on a fellow-
ship granted him by the Nether-

land-American Foundation for re- 1

Search in bio-‘physics. Jan says,
“The foundation chose Pittfor me
but I am sure if I had my choice I
too would have picked Pitt, since
I consider it theforemost univer-
sity in the world in the field I am
Working.”
,  Came Here in -October

e received his bachelor degree
from the University of Amsterdam
in 1947 and took his Doctorate ex-
am at the same place. He came to
Pitt~Oct. 1,‘ 1951.

_ Commenting on the American
method‘ of. education he said,
“American students are not free.
They are coached too much up

only are they allowed to develop

Internationalss
Start Dances

An International Dance’ Group
is being organized here at the Uni-
versity. This group will be un-
der the direction of Miss Margar-
et‘ E. Covert, director of required
physical education for women, and

tionalities. Representatives of dif-

ferent nations will teach their na-
tive ' dances.

This dance group is open to all n

women students who have some
training in dancing. The- ﬁrst
meeting will be heldion Thursday,
Feb». 28, at 3:30 p.m. in the Cathe-
dral Gym. At this time, authentic
-dances of Hawaii »will be taught
by a guest teapher.

their own thoughts. In Holland
students spend six years in ele-
mentary school, and six years in
secondary school where they re-
ceive the equivalent of a two
year American college educa-
tion. These years are spent
without all the advisors Ameri-
can students have. The teachers
simply instruct.”

Jan was in the Netherlands dur-
ing the German occupation of that
country. When the Nazis com-
manded him to sign a loya_lty oath
to their government, he ﬂed and
worked as a farmer for several
months, ,

_ Worked for British

In 1945 he worked for the
British army as an interpreter,

w

an achievement which accounts for
his surprising knowledge of Eng-

lish.

“The Germans,” he said, “com-
pletely destroyed the Dutch eco-
nomic system, besides, their other
atrocities, but the people of my
homeland are making great strides
forward in rebuilding it.”

On questions concerning differ-
ent phases of'Am‘erican life, Jan
said he found American men more
capable I and handier with tools
than the men of his country.. I

’ A Basketball ‘Elegant’ .

In sports he ﬁnds basketball
‘elegant,’ but cannot understand
football, “I cannot appreciate

Wrestling but I admire the skill,’’,

he added. 

Jan’s work at Pitt will soon be
ﬁnished. He, plans to’ return to his
fathefa two sisters, and brother
who are still in Leiden, in June of
this year. -

“But,” helisaid, .“I will never

0 forget the greatness and friend-

liness of the American people,
especially those at Pitt. You
certainly have \a country and
school to be very proud of.”

Bishop ‘Slaps
Brotherhood,
Hypocrisy

“'There’s a lot of bunk in this
idea of brotherhood,” declared
Bishop G. Bromley Oxnam in an
interview with the News last
week. A The nationally _. known
Methodist leader asserted that we
must not let “pretty speches” take
the place of facing the “speciﬁc is-

sues” that divide us.

Bishop Oxnam, American Presi-
dent of the World Council of
Churches, has, been a prominent
and controversial ﬁgure on the
national scene for years. '

The Bishop charged that many
rother-
hood, -but not practicing it. He
said: 0
.“It’s no good to talk. about
brotherhood and then practice
segregation. Much of the church,
by closing its doors to Negroes,
shows that it doesn’t really mean
too much of what it says.”

The Bishop, however, called the
progress towards brotherhood‘ in
the-past years “extraordinary.” He
cited the increasing number of
Negroes voting in the South as
partial evidence of this. _ ‘

Profs. Ware and Curtis

View New York ,Pllays

"By VINCE LEONARD
Dr. Ralph H. Ware and Dr. Ford E. Curtis of the English
department toured a large portion of the‘ New York theatri-
cal circuit wtih their Wives during the semester vacation,
seeing hit plays, musicals, and movies.

Two of the best plays they sawé

were “Point of No Return”, and

“The Shrike.” The better musicals
were “The King and I”, “Guys and
Dolls”, and “Paint Your Wagon.”
Two movies they enjoyed were
“The Greatest Show on Earth”
and the Japanese ﬁlm, “Rosho-
mon.” '

Fonda in ‘Point of No Return’ 0'

They opened their visit by at-

tending “Point of, No Return,”.

starring Henry Fonda. A 40-year-

iold bank clerk, Fonda devotes

most of his time striving to ac-

quire the vice presidency of the

bank; _But upon deciding to give
up his desire and remain a bank
c1erk,‘he realizes it is suddenly too
late to turn back;-hence, the title.

Although Dr. Ware enjoyed the,

play, he enjoyed more a lady’s
comment on thecramped condi-
tions of the theater. He overheard

her say, “I don’t ‘know what I’ll '

do with my legs. I think I’ll have
to wrap them around the woman
in front of me.”
Ferrer in ‘The Shrike’
“The Shrike” features Jose Fer-

rer, who has been extremely suc-

cessful on Broadway with his di-
recting of “Twentieth -Century”
and “Stalag 17.”. In this play he
produces, directs, and stars. .Dr.
Ware. describes the Shrike as a
predatory bird who takes the per-
son of Ferrer’s treacherous wife in
the play. The story is a psycho-
logical study of a man who at-
tempts suicide and is forced into
Bellevue Hospital by his wife.
“Guys and Dolls”, the Drama

Critics’ Prize -Musical with Sam.

Levene and Vivian Blaine as
Damon Runyon characters ’is as
“good as any I ever saw,” said Dr.
Ware. The songs he particularly
