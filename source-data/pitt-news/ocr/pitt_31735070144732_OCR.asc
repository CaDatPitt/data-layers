0 Iraq war anniversary, students reflect

by Richard Rosengarten
Staﬂ Writer

Six years after President George
W Bush initiated the shock and
awe campaign in Iraq, U.S. forces
will remain in Iraq under President
'Barack Obama’s withdrawal plan,
and their numbers will increase in
Afghanistan. ‘ "
Each year, theanriiversary of
the start of the war in Iraq —

which occurred on Thursday ——
brings some people together to
raise awareness of the Iraqi. and
American death tolls and" of the
billions of dollars spent on the

war..

And like Pittsburgh native Ed ‘

Bortz, they gather to say, “Enough
is enoug .” I -

“It’sV six years way too long,”
said Bortz, “It should have never
started. We should «have never be-

come an occupying country.”

Bortz’s is a voice shared by
many others, ‘frustrated by the
consequences of the U.S. military
presence abroad. '

In the throes of economic tur-
moil, people can forget that there’s
a war going on, he said, but U.S.
military activity is relevant to our
economic troubles.

Funding for the war on terror
has averaged $593 billion yearly

    

Friday

from 2003 to 2005, according to
the Congressional Budget Office.
Bush asked for $193 billion in
2008.

Pitt freshmen Taylor Buck and
Kevin Foley attended a candlelight
 in-East Liberty on Thursday
to rally support for the wars’ end.

“Anytime anyone goes to war,
it’s important to help stop people
from dying,” said Buck.

Foley added, “I feel a responsi-

Wed.ding planner knows his way around‘Heinz Chapel

by Tamara Braunstein

Senior Staﬂ Writer

Behind the Cathedral of Learn-
ing sits Heinz Memorial Chapel.
And behind the chapel is the
man who runs it, Tom Meisner.
Meisner, the chap_el’s docent,

and self—proclaimed .“jack-of—all =

trades,” spends his time at the cha-
pel giving tours, caring for the fa-
cility and coordinating weddings.
Every day atthe chapel is a little
different. And Meisner likes that.

“I’m very happy'to be here, I
have no slow days, and I’m happy
to provide information to stu-
dents, visitors, brides, grooms and
graduates,” he said.

Meisner most enjoys the wed-
dings in Heinz Chapel.

He and his wife, Elaine, got
married there almost 40 years ago.
. In the last eight years, Meisner’s
worked on somewhere between
600 and 700 weddings.

“Weddings are my favorite

part. of my job because everyone‘

leaves happy,” ‘said Meisner, who

. has three degrees from Pitt, in-

cluding -a doctorate in educational
administration. I

Meisner takes his job_ so seri-
ously that he often knows more

' about a bride’s wedding plans than

the mother of the bride, he said.
, Thankslto a four—page survey
he created for his brides, pertain-
ing to the logistics of the ceremo-
ny, Meisner said he has never been

asked a question that he has not
already discussed with the _bride.

' “He made sure everything ran
smoothly for the rehearsal  and
[during the wedding] he’s right
there, making ‘sure everything is in
order,” said Mary Beth Vasko of

‘Meisner’s help with her wedding

in 2096. _

Meisner said that he asks ques-
tions that often go overlooked,
such as the seating of step-par-
ents. ‘ -

“I assume nothing,” said Meis-
ner.. “I need to ask questions in
advance because issues »can’t wait

Riot cases
go to court

by Lindsay Carroll
Senior Staﬂ Writer

.\X/esley Plank entered court on
Monday  he was charged with
a misdemeanor crime for his involve-
ment in last month’s Super Bowl riots

But the police withdrew the origi-
nalchatgesforfailuretodisperseand
instead charged the Pit senior with
arson, not and causing or risking catas-
trophe, a felony crime with more seri-

‘We were both sutpiised,” said
Planl<_’s attorney, Turahn  “\X/e
tho.ught we’d be  the same deal
as everyone else”

By everyone else, he means the
44 people accused of crimes related
to the Super Bowl riots Forty-one of
them showed up in Pittsburgh’s Mu-
 Court Monday.

Two pleaded innocent and will
await later hearings, and seven pleaded
guilty to harassment and paid a fine of
$300, according to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette Thirty—one others had the op-
tion of performing 50 hours of com-
munity service, the paper reported.

Pitt’s Vice Chancellor of Public
Affairs Robert Hill said he couldn’t
conﬁrm the details of the proceed-
ings, or whether all of the 44 who at-

 

tended hearings on Monday were Pitt
students or elaborate on the details the

‘Keg registration
  a Hat proposal

State Sen. Stewart Green-

s leaf, R-Montgomery, just doesn’t

3 know when to quit.
a For 17 years — that’s every
' year since 1992 — Greenleaf has
proposed a keg-registration bill
‘ that would require people buy-
i ing beer kegs to complete a nurn-
i bered form listing their name and
 address. The keg then would be
 branded with an identiﬁcation tag
j matching it to its buyer.
, Greenleaf believes this pro-
 cedure would effectively curb
 underage drinking. If police can
 track a marked keg to its purchas-
 er, adults should be less inclined
j to buy kegs and pass them on to
_; minors. Additionally, a more rigid
 registration plan would dissuade
 those younger than 21 from mak-
: ing the initial keg purchase.

This year, Greenleaf said his
L pitch made it further along the
_ political process than it-ever has.
 Last Wednesday, the senate’s Law
' and justice Committee sent it to
 the full state senate for consider-
 ation.
3 Although Greenleaf’s policy
 exempliﬁes an earnest, well-
: intentioned attempt to diminish
 underage drinking, his plan soon
 ﬁzzles when thinking realistically.
V Aside from Greenleaf’s stub-
ll born persistence —— one would
 think he’d give up after 17 failures
’ —— this plan contains foreseeable
 shortcomings that explain the
 bill’s consistent rejections.
, Regardless of new legislation,
: minors will always ﬁnd ways to
 obtain and consume alcohol. ‘On
; any college campus —— not ex-
 cluding Pitt, of course — alco-
 hol ‘ﬂows through house parties
 like water. Because this proposal
 deals exclusively with kegs, its
 aimed more at reducing binge
 drinking at parties. Yet, the streets

of South Oakland wouldn’t sud-  I
denly empty on any given Friday 
night in response to this policy’s 

enactment.

Anyone older than 21 still 
could purchase a keg and throw  ,
a party where minors are served. 
If the party was thrown at the 
purchaser’s home and the keg 
was registered td that address, the 
provider. would be at no greater 
or less of a risk of being caught 
even with this law in place. There- 
fore, the group of people whose 
actions this law is supposed to 
regulate would probably ﬂat out 

disregard its implications.

Let’s not forget, beer comes in

ties would still go on even if all

Greehleaf also didn’t say what 
the cost would be to implement 
this procedure. We wonder if 
the cost, even if minimal, would 
measure up to how effective — 
or rather, ineffective —-— this law

Instead of trying to start 21 

policy that only concerns itself
with one aspect of underage

drinking, legislators shouldfocus 
on the full extent of the matter. i

Yet, among a culture ingrained
with a party mentality, perhaps
legislation isn’t the best way to

address this matter. A bill that’s )
failed 17 times reveals a struggle 3

in vain to counter one aspect of
an issue that’s still thriving even

under the inﬂuence of the law.

The episode last month involv-

mauled a woman and was eventu-

eclipsed by the controversy sur-
rounding a certain rather. careless

that seemingly implies a monkey

But there’s a matter unrelated
to the cartoon that’s been ef-
fectively‘ overlooked: Why in the
name of all that is good did some-

one have a chimpanzee as a pet? .

Perhaps keeping a wild animal
around the house expresses one’s
worldliness or appreciation for
the exotic. Or, maybe it’s just cruel
and hazardous to all creatures in-
volved, humans included.

I’d like to imagine that all own-
ers of wild animals reside on spa-
cious ranches somewhere between

you’ve heard of your neighbors

among other beasts, a herd of
bison, a few lions, a half-dozen
tigers, a giraffe, some breed of
eerily tiny deer, assorted snakes
and an elephant for the majority
of my childhood.

The bison escaped their decid-
edly shoddy fencing a few times
and roamed the countryside. This

caused some consternation in the

area since folks just didn’t feel safe
driving around while preying an
800—pound behemoth didn’t try
to mate with their Toyota.

All things considered though,
we were happy to tolerate a hand-
ful of overgrown cows if the al-
ternative was a collection of big
cats. While I worshipped my fa-
ther as _the embodiment of mas-
culinity and protection as much as
the kid next to me, I had no illu-
sions about his ability to defend
his family from a handful of tigers
should they break free.

If these people had raised
dogs, I wouldn’t have taken issue
with it. Sure, dogs get loose on oc-
casion. But they usually just dig up
gardens and relieve themselves in
your yard. Tigers, however, play a

« different game. I must admit that

a low point of my adolescence
came when I was legitimately wor-
ried about being guzzled down by

One cannot forget, though,
that a healthy habitat is in no
way the same as an ideal habitat,
which is all but impossible to fake
no matter the resources available.

Even with all his billions Warren,

Buffett couldn’t provide a pride

Zoos, obviously, also keeps

animals in an environment other
than their natural lone. Whether
zoos are ethical or not merits an-
other column entirely. But a re-
spectable zoo can at least simulate
an anirnal’s habitat.

Perhaps the greatest issue with
keeping feral animals in domestic
situations is that ‘they cannot be

a few years that eventually re-

from a tiger as an animal can get.
Ultimately, an individual wish-
ing to own a wild animal is similar

to an individual wishing to own
an automatic weapon. Why do
you need one?

The beneﬁts of owning a wild
animal are mostly limited to in-
consistent money earned from
festival, promotional and, with
luck, television appearances. The

owners probably take pleasure
in having some weird form of

* To the Editor,

Shannon Black, School of Arts and Sciences

Regarding yesterdays article “Pitt van policy an issue for students,” I was shocked by Dean Kathy Humphrey’s hypocrisy. She states that she will
help the student groups adversely affected by the new rules but then continues to say the policy will not be changed. The only way to truly help the
groups affected — many of which are important to the community, such as Jumpstart — is to compromise and change some of the more ridiculous

no sense. In a group of involved undergrads, it is rare to ﬁnd anyone older than the age of 22, let alone 25.
The chaperone rule is beyond patronizing and also equally improbable. Advisers will not want to jump in a van for every trip. Students —— who should
be considered adults by the University — will chafe under the idea of needing a chaperone. Unless these two aspects are changed, many out-of—state.
trips will slowly disappear. I ﬁnd it surprising that a clean who wants to amp up Pitt’s community service through events such as “Make a Difference

beings.

I disagree with the viewpoint expressed by Giles Howard in his article “Obama

First, I do not believe that Howard fully understands many of the terms and con-
cepts he uses in the article. For example, the headline refers to class warfare and sug-
gests that Obama supports it. Class warfare is inherent in any capitalist society such as
ours. It is represented by the struggles of the Third World to ﬁght against exploitation
by multi-national corporations. Here at home it is represented by labor unions ﬁghting
to receive just compensation for their services or the inner city population ﬁghting for
a better school system for America’s impoverished youth sirn_ila.r to the one enjoyed
by the children of America’s wealthy. This is the underlying concept of class warfare
V as deﬁned by experts on the topic, including Karl Marx and Max Weber. Therefore,
Obama’s recent policy proposals would actually combat class warfare, not promote it.

Howard labels Obama’s plan a “socialized medicine scheme.” This implies doctors
and hospitals work directly for the government. In Obama’s plan, he simply looks to
provide means for those without health care insurance to obtain it and even aims to
lower insurance costs for those who already have it. I ﬁnd it sad that Howard cannot
ﬁnd empathy for his fellow Americans and, to a greater extent, for his fellow human

Kevin Foley, School of Arts and Sciences

To the Editor,

I was shocked and appalled after reading Matt Diabes’
article titled “Market Central trays not all that bad.” The
rumor that the trays will be thrown out or given to other
universities is simply not true. We are still researching
what to do with the trays. This will be announced as soon
as a suitable idea is passed through Sodexho.

The scoff at the relevancy of removing trays is lu-
dicrous. If Diabes truly believes that 29,600 pounds of
wasted food is irrelevant, perhaps he should ask a starv-
ing village what they could do with 29,600 pounds of
food. He also mentions that water used to wash the trays
is “less than one gallon”. This is correct, it’s about one-
third gallon of water. With about 1,800 people coming to
Market Central just for lunch and dinner, that’s about 600
gallons of water wasted. There are people in the world
that must walk miles every day for water to drink that may
not even be safe. How could we justify wasting more than
600 gallons of water daily out of pure convenience?

by Margaret Krauss
Senior Staff [Writer

Holly Forsberg and Chelsea
Holmes led a warm-up from the
front of the room. While heavy
bass blasted from the back of Trees
Hall’s second—ﬂoor ballet studio, the
two made wide circles with their
hips as seven rows of students fol-
lowed their lead.

“Don’t hold yourself so stifﬂy!”
Forsberg shouted over her shoulder.
“Get loose, roll your hips!”

Her ponytail swished in coun-
terpoint to her hips, while the class
members did their best to imitate
her relaxed stance, laughing good-
naturedly at their reflections.

Welcome to Party Dance, maybe
the most unique class at Pitt;

Created several years ago by Su-
san Gillis Kruman, the head of Pitt’s

dance department, Party Dance is
meant to boost the waning dance
courage of our generation.
According to Courseweb, “The
class will focus on generic dance
movements that you can use in so-
cial dance situations. Hip—hop, line
dances like the Electric Slide and
Achey-Breaky and free form styles

will be highlighted. Understanding
rhythm and moving rhythmicallywill
also be included. Learn how to learn
dance so you can feel confident at
weddings, house parties and clubs.
This is strictly for non—dancers that
want to become dance conﬁdent”
The class was broken down into
distinct segments —— after a general
dance warm—up that included neck
rolls, pelvic thrusts and lunges, the
class moved to crunches and stretch-
ing. Finally, the class of 40 grouped

itself into ﬁve lines on one side of
the room. Forsberg took the floor.

“We’re going to get started with
some simple stuff. What you’re go-
ing to do is step, jump, step, jump,
step, jump.”

As she said it, she demonstrated.

Forsberg worked her way back
to the group. “Step, jump, step,
jump, step, jump, OK?” she faced
the class. “And if I see anyone just
jumping, I will point you out and
laugh, so get it right,” she said, gar-
nering a happy “boo” from the class
members, some bouncing their hips
while Holmes turned on the music.

“First group, go!” Forsberg
yelled. The first line made its way
across the floor, buoyed by chatter
coming from the lines waiting their
turn, friends  them on.

“Yeah, Amy!”

“C’mon, Kristal”

“Look at Steven,” a couple of
guys laughed, “he looks so excited.”

There were few faces that didn’t look excit-

self-doubt, the half-boy, half-girl demographic

‘appeared -‘equally glad to be 'step—_jum_ping

across the studio, some improvising a bit of

hip gyration -as they went, clowning for their

“The goal is to get people comfortable
—- to be comfortable moving their hips and
to be comfortable dancing. And I think most

of them really want to do it,” said Forsberg. -

“Wc’rc always at capacity, not that I want to
play it up, but,the people who take this class
want to be here.” _

Waiting her turn to cross the ﬂoor, junior
Krista Hclscl explained that Party Dance was a
break from the norm. ‘ -

“With all my other classes, this one keeps
me sane —— it’s just fun. No one judges you
because no one can dance,” shclaughed. Her.

as ‘The Hustle,” “Thriller” and even “Single

change from the normal grind of homework

one’s social life.

‘“The Hustle’ came ‘on at a party_I was at

it,” said junior Lorraine Fowler. “I don’t take
dance too seriously, and I’m horrible, but I
love this class.”

“When it’s timcto get up and walk up the

junior Carly Werner. “But once I get up here
and we get into lines, it puts me in such a good

That the class is taught by two fellow stu-
dents only serves to increase the class’s appeal.
“I think it’s better with. student teachers,”-

Senior Colin Gorman nodded.
’ “\X/c were just looking to have fun and take
a dance class. I love it — it’s so chill,” he said.
An enjoyable class is just what Forsberg
and Holmes want to create.
“We want to have as much fun as they do,”
said Forsberg.
The two welcome as many people who
want to come. Though the official cap is 40

“It makes people more comfortable if

“The more goofy wc are and the more
fun wc’rc having, the better the atmosphere
is. People feel like they can break loose and

She and Holmes sat on the stu_dio’s bleach-

Isaak's latest "album isn't so

March 20, 2009

Isaak ‘is Wicked

Isaak, page 10

But despite Isaak’s best effort to create
captivating vocals in the song, it is relatively
bland 4 mainly because of its topic. He sings

'_ about falling out of loving, leaving the “cheat-
er’s town” and debating if -he will ever return-

home.

Unfortunately, the album never truly picks A

up from the slow start. 10 of the next 13 songs
are about former loves and coping.
Thankfully, Isaak’s great singing keeps the
album bearable and almost enjoyable. He puts
on a clinic for vocalists as he showcases nearly
every type of vocal talent and technique.

In “We Got Tomorrow” (one of the few,

optimistic love songs), he puts his smooth and
soft voice on full display, which is striking con-
sidering that the previous song, “You Don’t
Cry Like I Do,” features incredibly power-

ful high notes, which he holds for ridiculous.

lengths after singing extremely softly in the
verses. ' '

Along -with the aforementioned falsettos,
he also showcases his_modern rocker voice. In
“Mr. Lonely Man,” which is ironically upbeat
considering the title, he switches from the fa-

miliar Elvis-style intro into a modern rocker \
that sounds very similar to ]et’s “Are You

Gonna Be My Girl.” _ —
Isaak is lookingin the mirror at his lone-

ly, depressing self and sings, “I don’t,usually .

It looks like you’re the only ﬁiend I’ve got.”

The song ends with Isaak shouting, “How am -

I gonna do it?” which tiiggers a  response

from the band; as it asks the same question.
“Mr. Lonely Man” is by far the most — if

not the only —— truly interesting song on the

_album in terms of substance. But “Breaking

Apart” takes the crown for vocal interest.
The song is a duet  Trisha Yearwood,

A and neither musician sings backup to the other

as their voices blend beautifully while belting
out this breakup song. They both sing about
how they pretend to be ﬁne after the break-

up.

without you / I’ll be all right,” Isaak redun-
dantly sings. M

Isaak and Yearwood take turns  to
convince themselves that they are OK, but
they ﬁnally give in.

‘Tm breaking apart inside / Cry in my
sleep at night,” they sing powerfully before
they switch into a beautifully harmonic fal-
setto. I '

Yearwood has recorded numerous du-
ets with her husband Garth Brooks, but the
couple’s vocals do not blend nearly as well as

games are getting rusty i

Isaak’s and Yearwood’s. Their equally power-

' ful voices make for adoubly powerful song.

The rest of the album is unfortunately

bland. Every song deals with love and most of . -

them are depressing. There are no profound

realizations about life or love, and each song’
V basically whines about a woman that did him -

wrong. .

Isaal<’s  vocals can’t save this al-
bum. So if you’re ever feeling too happy or
invincible, just pop this CD in and you’ll come
crashing back down to reality.

Pitt practiced in helmets for
a few hours inside the UPM/C

marily by position for a majority
of the afternoon before coming
together to run some offense-vss
defense drills to end the day.

“I was pleased with the effort

and the focus,” said Pitt coach

many people who have no idea
what he or she is talking about
do indeed participate. .It’s the
art of ﬁlling out your bracket.
It is the ofﬁce pool phenomena.
Its intrigue, founded in mon-
etary gains, yields the real reason
people catch college hoops fever
when March rolls around and a
huge part of why we consider the
month so “mad.”

Rebecca is just one of the
brave many who have volun-
teered themselves to organize a
pool and thus will be faced with
the task of painstakingly tallying
all the results of all the games for
all whom enter her pool. It will be
tedious, but oh it will be fun.

“It helps me pay attention
for the Tournament more,” said
Rebecca, who requested her last

basketball, so that’s good.”

Here, keep track of my picks. I got
a lot of money on this. Oh  here,

Student: This is a menu

Me: I want the chicken sub. And
get some onion  or something.

Then I would deﬁnitely get a
reputation among the other teach-
ers because all the dudes like me in
high school would take the hall pass
and ﬂock to my room to watch the

‘games and tell everybody that’s

where theyfre going because Mr. M
is cool.

Yeah.

- By the way, how awesome
would it have been to have all three
Division-I college basketball teams
from Pittsburgh — Pitt, Duquesne
and good old Bobby Mo — in the
Tournament? Nonetheless, Pitt and
Robert Morris made it and Duquesne
almost beat Virginia Tech in the NIT.

enough. But not everyone is John
Wooden. For the casual hoops
fan, it is the money put on the
line in bracket pools that reels
him in and heightens the hysteria
around one of the greatest Amer-
ican sporting events every year.

Next to the Super Bowl, the

.men’s tournament is the most

bet-on sporting event year in and
year out according to 1800sports.
com, a popular online betting site.
And it even lasts a whole month.

Bets are taken in various dif-
ferent forms, from Las Vegas ca-
sinos to personal computers and
the like. But it is the act of ﬁlling
out that paper bracket that has
become the true symbol of the
Tournament wagering.

And don’t expect the worst
economic crisis since the Great
Depression to hold betters back.

Coal): Pittsburgh Weather (inconsis-
tent but mostly ugly), Pittsburgh Pop
(short for the city’s declining popu-
lation, which the team’s attendance
would inevitably mimic), Pittsburgh
Carp (named for the three rivers’
most recognizable ﬁsh, not Karp of
“Mighty Ducks” fame).

Despite the ritual’s vast popu-

illegal. So while many think that
throwing up a measly $5 or $10
is harmless, every time someone
does, he is breaking the law. Pool
selling and bookrnaking are ﬁrst-
degree misdemeanors carrying a
maximum penalty of a $10,000
ﬁne and ﬁve years in prison.

The practice, however, is so
pervasive and popular that au-
thorities tend to let it fall by the

-wayside. It could become more

problematic if administrators set
up the pools for proﬁt, but most
people aren’t out to take a cut.

And so it began yesterday,
when the Tournament ofﬁcially
tipped off. For the ﬁrst few days,
game results will come in bunch-
es. People will check their paper
brackets, the Yahool, ESPN and
Facebook pools they’ve entered.
Some will have big bucks on the
line, and some will play for fun.

We may see a day when Inter-
net pools prove too much for the
old school paper bracket and it is
washed out.

But one thing is for certain:
People will continue to bet, con- ’
tinue to ﬁll out their brackets
and watch until the ﬁnal buzzer
sounds. Along with the school
lucky enough to be cutting down
the nets will be thousands of fans
just as excited that their bracket ‘
proved to be the best. It’s a long
shot, but it sure is worth it.

Win or lose, it will be a helluva
good time. ~

East Tennessee State has yet to play a
ranked opponent this season, though Bartow
— who was with the NCAA Tournament-
winning 1987 Indiana Hoosiers as a gradu-
ate assistant — knew March Madness would
change that.

“We knew that ﬁrst—round game was going
to be against probably a top-10 team what-
ever our seed was,” said Bartow. “We knew it
was going to be a good team, and we knew it
was going to be the best team we’d played all

year.

 

We're playing good right now. We're
playing our best basketball of the

YCEUT.

    

Despite the lack of quality opponents, the
school has a history of close NCAA Tourna-
ment games. The 1989 Buccaneers, a No. 16
seed, like the 2009 squad, came within a bas-
ket of knocking off No. 1 Oklahoma, losing
72-71. In their last Tournament appearance in
2004, they nearly upset No. 4—seeded Cincin-
nati, falling by three.

“I think as a team, we just got to take that
[history] and just feed off it,” said Pigram.

The victor of the game will face the winner
between No. 8 seed Oklahoma State and No.
9 seed Tennessee. Oklahoma State defeated
rival Oklahoma in the Big 12 tournament be-
fore bowing out, while the Volunteers are 3-0
in the ﬁrst round under coach Bruce Pearl.

“I think we got the toughest bracket, but
it:’s really not a problem to us,” said Pitt junior
Jermaine Dixon. “We expected that.”
