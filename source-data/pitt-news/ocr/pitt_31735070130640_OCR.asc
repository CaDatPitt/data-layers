Gore host 25,000

Brendan Hanis had been lining up portable fencing and 

up audio equipment at Point State Park since 2 am. Monday mom— _

mg

University Democrats, to ready the park for yesterday’s vice presi-
dential visit. -

He only had an “hour” and a half of sleep.

While U. S. Secret Service officials conducted a security sweep
of the park, Harris, the external vice president of the U.D.s, informed
members that most of them wo11ld be working on crowd control.

“Watching out for Republicans,»kinda,” he said,‘s_mirking.

Gore tore through ﬁve key cities yesterday, including
Philadelphia, Flint, Mich., and Tampa, Fla., before visiting
Pittsburgh on a Labor Day campaign swing titled “Al and Joe’s Hard
Day’s Night Tour.” The democratic presidential hopeful travelled to
Louisville after the rally at the Point. A V '

, President Stephanie Strazisar said Pitt democrats didn’t ﬁnd out
about the event until just ﬁve days prior.

Sophomore Samantha Bufﬁngton, a dual political science and

i Spanish major, said she ‘had just joined the ~U.D.s at the Activities

Fair, Aug. = 27.

“A week ago, I wasn’t anything, and now I’m here,” she said.

Point State Park was transformed into a major political grand-
stand, as not only Gore, but the Rev. Jesse Jackson, as well as
AFL—CIO President Jack Sweeney and the national press corps
descended on the city. A

Red, white and blue bunting hung from every available sur-
face, as American ﬂags whipped in the moist wind. A large
Pennsylvania commonwealth flag ﬂew over the stone bridge mark-
ing the entrance to‘ the park, reminding visitors how precious
Pennsylvania’s electoral votes are to the Nov. 7 election.

Harris was oneof 60 official U.D. volunteers at the event. While
most democrats were assigned to crowd control duty, which
involved directing pedestrian traﬁc, , he and senior Doug
Guggenheim were armed with confetti guns to punctuate Gore’s
speech. Other volunteers fed handfuls of red, white and blue paper
stars. into tanks of carbon dioxide, which propelled the confetti
throughout the crowd of 25,000. . »

Sports Editor-

Six players from the ‘Pitt football team S

were suspended from playing in Saturday’s
game against Kent State for disciplinary rea-
sons -dating back to last school year.‘ . _
Although no reason was _ given for the
suspensions, it has been ‘widely ‘speculated

by. local media that the players sat out thew
game as a result of their involvement in a

scandal last year dealing with’ phone access
codes. ‘ - A

Players fromlthe Pitt baseball,.”basketball P

and track teams were suspended last year for

the incident, in which athletesgallegedly gar- —

nered an illegal access code -for“ the campus

phones and racked up thousands of dollars in ‘

phone calls.
A The players, suspended were wide receiv-
er Antonio Bryant, defensive back Taron

Football players benched  

' -Clray,‘ linebacker Gerald Hayes,‘ ‘defensive

lineman Darrell McMurray, quarterback Rod

lRuth'”erfo,rd j and ‘defensive back Ramon

Walker. The penalties on the players were not
imposed until last weekend because there
had been no games since the misconduct
occurred. ‘ . _. .

The suspensions were all for the duration

of one game, except- in the case of Walker,

who was also suspended for the game this
Saturday against Bowling Green. Harris did
not say why Walker received a sharper penal-
ty than the other players.

. In fact, Harris didn’t'say muchat all

about the suspensions. In his post-gamepress
- conference, he read a statement to the media.

“As you know, we were without six key
_ players today,” Harris - said.
“Discipline and being accountable for one’s
actions are a -top priority for our program,
and myself  I will not comment any more
on this.” - - 0

It wasn’t a bird and it wasn't a
plane. Instead, it was four U.S. Air
Force specialists parachuting into Three
Rivers Stadium for the Panthers’ first
football game on Saturday.

The men were part of the U.S. Air
Force Special Tactics . And Rescue
Specialist Parachute" Demonstration
Team, which was in Pittsburgh to
encourage Air Force recruiting, in addi-
tion to delivering the game ball.

“It’s kind of like a live Air Force
ad,” said Staff Sgt. Ty Clark.

The ad [was an elaborate‘ one.
Around 3:00’ p.m. Saturday, Clark

jumped from a C-130 over Three »
Rivers, carrying the U.S. Air Force flag, _

"and Senior  Brad»_Bra‘ddock car-
ried a Pitt ﬂag in -addition to -the actual

Winds measuring more than 15
knots made landing too dangerous for
the men, in the already tricky Three
Rivers Stadium.

“It’s like a bowl,” Clark said, of the 1 .

difficulty of landing at the righ-Lspot on
the ﬁeld. ' - ,

Despite the difficulty, al1’four men
landed safely, amid loud cheering from
the nearly 30,000 assembled fans. 1

While the~Air Force STARS were ‘
in town to kick off the Panthers’ season,
they were also recruiting current Pitt
Air Force ROTC cadets for ‘combat ’
controller duty, which_can lead to train-
ing and commissioning within the high-
ly prestigious STARS team.

_ From’ a ﬁeld of ‘ 80 cadets, Clark
said one or ‘two may eventually see

Free tickets, ﬂee T—shirts, free music,
free food, and a neon-green goal post.

Pitt football fans took over the
Wrlliarn Pitt Union lawn Friday afternoon
celebrating the Pitt Program Council-
sponsored Countdown to Kickoff.

‘This is an exciting time for Pitt foot-
ball,” said Alby Oxenreiter, sports
reporter for Fox. “I feel real good about
the opening weeks and a lot of excitement
around the Penn State game. Walt Harris
has done a great job at building the pro-

gram right”

Friday, the excitement was conta-
gious.

Smiles and sweat covered the faces
of fans devouring Domino’s pizza and
jarmning to hip hop blasting from the disc
jockey booth on the Union patio. The
dance team and cheerleaders competed
with DMX and Will Smith as they chant-
ed “Let’s go Pitt.” .

Blue and gold paint saturated the
hands of the artists creating their own
unique — and free i —- Pitt T—shi1ts.
Determined fans painted their shirts, hop-
ing Harris would like their design the best
“Pitt Pride,” and “PSU Sucks” were com-
mon designs. Carrie Shultz, a  mem-

ber, was amazed at some of the more cre— '‘

ative slogans such as “In Walt We Trust,”
and one by a younger Panther fan, “I love
ducks, Penn State Sucks.”

Paul Miller, a CGS student, watched
his daughter make her shirt. He made the
kickoff a family event, bringing his wife
and two children. b 

‘This is so muchfun,” he said.

Despite the heat, some students used
the provided authentic Pitt gear to dress
up like a football star and pose with a
Heisman trophy, helmet and all.

Around 5:30 p.m., PantherV1sion,
the same display board from Pitt Stadium,
geared up the crowd with the 1999
‘Panther football highlights for the arrival
of Walt Harris. Two coach buses, ﬁlled

with members of the 2000 squad, parked ‘
on Bigelow Boulevard. Loud cheers ‘

greeted Harris, and football captains Jeff
McCur1ey, Ryan Gonsales, and Tim
Stein. _ S»

Harris armounced that since the hon-
orary l2th Man.Captains he was to select
wo11ld be sharing a room that night at the
Doubletree Hotel with the team, rte was
asked to pick two of the same gender.

“My mother and father taught me
one thing, girls always ﬁrst,” Harris said,

Five ladies stepped up to the rnicro—
phone with their decorated shirts. One by
one each contestant showed off her shirt.
The audience screamed as Harris studied
the designs, and ﬁnally decided on two
captains. ,

The winners jumped up and down
and squealed before being whisked onto
the waiting buses. ’ /

“See you tomorrow, nice and loud,”
said Harris before leaving with his players

‘and honorary captains.

The excitement of the evening mel- r

lowed as the buses left, and the team
waved out of tinted windows to its fans.
Sara Mrljack, the PPC member
responsible for putting Friday’s event
together was very happy at the turnout of
the ldckoff. ' _
' “It all really came together with the
help of the PPC special events committee,
and the SGB executive board,” she said.

Saturday’s game was a
consummate victory

So we did it -— we played the ﬁrst
game of the season in Three Rivers
Stadium. We challenged the Kent State
Golden Flashes and we beat them big-
tirne. What’s even better, a considerable
number of fans braved the rain and the
trek across town to watch our Panthers
emerge Victoriously.

Getting to the stadiutn was easier
than anyone could have hoped or
expected. The University should be
commended on carrying through with
its promise to make transportation to
and from the game as hass1e—free as
possible. As early as three hours prior to
kickoff, shuttles were departing ﬁe-
quently from Bigelow Boulevard.

Cards providing instructions on
three different ways to get back from
Three Rivers were issued to all shuttle
passengers; surely these proved invalu-
able to the number of out-of—town fans
and confused freshmen who attended
the game as well as those upperclass—
men who remain embarrassingly clue-
less about the bus system and
Pittsburgh geography.

The trafﬁc lights Downtown
seemed speckled with some sort of
magic dust that rendered them green
while the shuttles were passing
through. In reality this was not magic
but the work of city police who con-
trolled the lights to allow for the speedy

passage of the shuttles.

Getting back was a breeze as well,
as retum shuttles ran periodically
throughout the game and after.

Inside Three Rivers, the atrnos—
phere was festive and surprisingly Pitt
Stadium-esque. Even the ﬂags with the
jersey numbers of retired Panthers were
present. A Panther logo beckoned to
fans ﬁom the center of the ﬁeld, and the
end zones were dressed accordingly,
one proudly bearing the name
“Pittsburgh” and the other “Panthers.”

Regrettably, though, the students
and the Pitt band were again forced to
endure a painful separation. The band

. was situated at one end zone, while the

student section was on the opposite side
of the stadium. Consequently, when
Pitt scored, the ﬁght song echoed
throughout the student section as more
of a quiet murmur than a triumphant
blast. « . « »
But even so, a spirited mass of
young bodies suffered through two rain
delays, managed to sing the ﬁght song
loudly and cheered the Panthers on to
their eventual victory. Thanks to the
University’s cooperation and the sur-
dents’ vigor, the game was a success in
all respects — and perhaps only a
warm-up to the euphoric madness that
will ensue in two weeks when Penn
State is at last conquerexl. ‘

Will l.ieberman embrace Satanists?

-comfort in a tortured Christ or a smiling_
Buddha, these Satanists draw their inspira-

Vice President Al Gore, Democratic nomi-
nee for the presidency of the United States,
made history this summer. when he chose
Joe Lieberman, a U.S_. senator
from Connecticut, as his running
mate. As the first observant Jew
to be nominated for vice presi-
dent by a major political party,
Lieberman has inspired a
renewed discussion about the role of religion
in public life. .

Lieberman, for his part, -has been enthu-
siastic in discussing both his own faith and
religion in general. He reiterated his posi-
tions during an Aug. 27 campaign appear-
ance at Fellowship Chapel, a black Christian

. church in Detroit. Lieberman noted that his
religion has “provided a foundation, order

and purpose to my life.” He also declared,
“The Constitution guarantees freedom of

4 religion, not freedom from religion.”

To his credit, Lieberman appears to be
reaching. out beyond the ranks of Christians
and Jews. He also met privaiely with about
25 Arab—Americar_1 leaders in the Detroit
suburb of Southfreld. In his remarks at

.Fellowship Chapel, he made a point of not-

ingthat “our mission is not onezof intoler-
ance but one of love.” .

A But how far does Lieberrnan’s tolerance
extend? In an article published Aug. 28,
Washington Post staff writer Ceci Connolly
noted that the Connecticut senator has
“proven himself adept at speaking the lan-
guage of many religions.” _

So I wonder — does Liebennan’s inter-
faith multilingualism include the language
of Satanism?

As I have noted‘ in past columns, '

Satanism enjoys the same First_Amendment
protection as any other religion. And once
you peel past bogus urban legends about
Satanic child sacriﬁce, you will discover
varied communities of individuals who are

not unlike Lieberman — hard—working, law-‘ —«

abiding Americans who just happen to prac-
tice a minority religion. Rather than take

tion from the figure of Satan, the proud
rebel. ‘

And like Lieberman, many

of these religious Satanists have

compelling testimonies to share

One such testimony that moved
me greatly is that of the Rev. Matt Paradise,

an author and publisher who is also a priest V

of the California-based Church of Satan.

On his Web site http://www.purging—r

talon.com, Paradise discusses growing up
with a lesbian mother and seeing her con-
front the ugly reality of anti—gay bigotry.
This background led him “to start question-

ing  all of the /sacred cows and holy writs

to which people somindlessly bow.” This
iconoclastic bent ultimately led him to “The
Satanic Bible,” the modern classic written

by Church of Satanfounder Anton’ LaVey, "

and to the Church of Satan itself.

Paradise‘ is typical of many of the
Satanists whom I have met or corresponded
with over the years. I have discovered these
diabolical disciples to be responsible, intelli-

gent individuals who are, like Lieberman, ‘

making positive contributions to the com-
munities in which they live and work. Such

_ Satanists should not be unfairly stereotyped
any more than practicing Christians should

be lumped together with Jim J ones-style cult
leaders or Aryan Nations-style hate groups.

So I hope that Lieberman truly extends .
his message of spiritual inclusiveness to all _

Americans -4 to the Cliristian, the Jew, the

Muslim, the Hindu, the Wiccan, the “reli-

gious atheist” and the Satanist alike.

And who knows‘ —_— perhaps one day;

we’ll see a practicing Satanist nominated for
the presidency or vice presidency of the
United States. If she’s the best} candidate for
the job, she’ll get my vote. , '

Michael J..Mazza would like to invite you all
[too a “Satanic Bible ” stitdy sometime.

fronts — first, enviromnental—

Ecology is not merely a socialist agenda

' Politics is full of silly claims and pro-
paganda. One of the more laughable
claims has been the notion, advanced by
some conservatives and libertarians, that
environmentalism is part of a. socialistic
plot.

This belief is false on two

ism works just fine when cou-
pled with capitalism, and sec-
ondly, socialist countries have
done just as well at raping and destroying
the world God gave us.

The absurdity of the claim can reach
ludicrous levels. Some critics targeted
Tirne’s Earth Day edition as socialist. If
they had actually bothered to read the

magazine, they would have noticed exarn- '

ples of how environmentalism has a mutu-
ally beneﬁcial arrangement with capital-
ism (and no examples of such an arrange-
ment with socialism). .

For instance, Time pointed out that
Xerox, Compaq and 3M cut greenhouse
gas emissions in half and received 50 per-
cent or higher return on their investment.

‘The energy—efﬁcient complex of ING

Bank in Holland saved 20 percent on
energywith no additional cost.

One of the largest growing sectors of
today’s economy is that of enviromnental-
ly friend1y.companies.

Stonyﬁeld Farms, for instance, is the
fastest growing yogurt company in

— America, even as it spends much ofits

income on funding reforestation projects,
organic farming and other environmental
causes. Pennsylvanians can now get clean
energy from Green Mountain. Collins and

~ Ajkman Floorcoverings increased produc-

tion 85 percent as they decreased landﬁll
waste by 79 percent.

In 1999, sales of environmentally
friendly products rose 20 percent —— so
why is this $7.9 billion—a-year industry
never mentioned as part of the “New
Economy”? ,

Of course, some businesses see the
potential proﬁts but still do not want to
reform. They pretend to be environmen-
tally friendly, even as they wreak havoc on
our world. For instance, that issue of Time
was exclusively sponsored by Ford Motor
Company. This is the same Ford that has

the worst fuel eﬁciency trend, that pro- ’

duces the cars and sport utility vehicles

«that emit the most carbon and whose vehi-

cle emissions increased over the past
decade, making it the least environmental-
ly friendly company in. an industry
renowned for pollution. Such whitewash-
ing is so common it now has its own
uniquetenn —— greenwashing. ‘

. Other brand names are just as pathet-
ic as Ford. Royal Caribbean pleaded
guilty to 21 charges of pouring hazardous
chemicals into American waters even as it

. was claiming that nothing was ever,

dumped overboard. Coca-Cola sponsors

grows, so will such deception. Americans
must be on the lookout for such corporate .
fraud.

Just as enviromnentalism and capital-
ism can go hand in hand, so can socialism
and environmental devasta-
tion. The Soviet Union
destroyed nature efficiently,
just like America, and trends
in China are disastrous. Not
only did the governments
avoid doing or saying anything to stop
such abuse, they tended to encourage it

with environmentally destructive subsi-

dies, as Mark Hertsgaard points out in his
book “Earth Odyssey.” '
Between capitalist and socialist

. nations (and the wide range in between),

 

over $500 billion is given out in environ-
mentally destructive subsidies. Here, a
reduced governmental role would help the
planet, even as the libertarians claim envi-
ronmentalism equals big government.
Wait, the libertarians will respond —

‘environmentalism really does sometimes

mean big government. Who else, after all,
will enforce all the rules and regulations
designed to protect our planet? Besides,
they’ll add, any restrictions on business
are a barrier to a laissez-faire economy.
Such claims suike me as rather odd.
What would we rather have —— a few more
dollars or a healthy planet? In his book
“Fool’s Gold: The Fate of Values in a
World of Goods,” Andrew Bard
Schmookler draws a parallel to the myth

k More For ess!

  G W  Anytime
‘I’  Nights&Weekends

of King Midas. This character gave wealth
the utmost priority -— and as a result lost
his family, and eventually deprived him-
self of his ability to sustain himself.

Similarly, by fostering the idea that
the market is greater than the planet, we
destroy God’s creation and ensure worse
health and conditions for) future genera-
tions. Schmookler writes, “We forget that
a creature that destroys its environment
destroys itse .”

Let’s not destroy ourselves when we
have the means to prevent such destruc-
tion. Buy green.

Mischa’ Gelman is not c0l0r—blina'. Hevcan

see that environmentalism is green, not
red.

Not all writers want main-stream fame. Some, like
Sandi Ward, a senior history major at La Roche
University, prefer to start’ small and see where it takes
them Ward has been publishing a homemade zine called
Superette since she was in 8th grade, ‘and in the eight
years and 16 issues between then and now, has not only
created a substantial portfolio, but a running commen-
tary of her life and the world through her eyes.

The Pitt News: Where did you come up with the idea for
a zine at the tender age of 13 ? j
Ward: I found out about zines from reading .“Sassy.”

They used to publish alot of articles about them and

how you could order them. Ithought they were a really
cool idea so I started writing my own. Eventually I
ordered some, ‘but in the beginning I didn’t know what

they were supposed to look like, but I understood the-

meaning behind them.

TPN: What was your ﬁrst zine about?

Ward: It had really bad comics, some recipes and a few
music articles. I wrote things like, “Oooh, I like Velocity
Girl,” and I bitched about how I didn’t like school. I also
wrote about this diet some girls at school were on, this
cleansing diet. I think I wrote sorrlething like, “I
cleansed for a day. It was dumb.” They weren’t too
appreciative of that, especially since I distributed it
around school for free. I didn’t need to make up any

 

costs because my mom copied it at work for
me for free. No, one understood it, though.

TPN: How did your writing and your zines
evolve once you got into high school?

Ward: I wrote a lot about the stupidity of
high school culture, about how I didn’t want
to be there. I went to Bridgeport High
School in West Virginia — I think my high
school was exceptionally bad at accepting
people. I wrote stuff like,» “no one under-
standsme,” but I wasn’t that angsty. I did a
lot of music reviews, more than I do now.
Instead of ranting about stuff, though, I
eventually started analyzing things and
looking at the stuff in my life deeper. ,

TPN: Are you constantly working on a
zine? ,

Ward: It takes me a while to get

one together. I used to do them all

the time, but now‘ with school-

work the ' fact that I put it

together myself, do all the typ-

ing, I deﬁnitely take hiatuses. It

takes a couple of months per zine.

I tried to" keep a journal last summer,

might write about summer stuff in the next
issue, maybe do a big music issue. There
aren’t a lot of small zines anymore that are

JENNIFER MECCAR|Ll.'EN1E E dedicated to music.

TPN: Have you met anyone famous through your zine?
Ward: When I was in 9tl1 grade I was really into that

I show ‘The Adventures of Pete and Pete” and I wanted

to interview Big Pete, who’s name is really Mike, for the

zinc. I wrote him a letter and sent it off with a SASE and l.

he wrote back about a week later. We became pen-pals
and sometimes we’d talk on the phone. Eventually I
asked him to go the prom with me and he did. He kinda
wimped out on the dancing part, though —— although he
did dance with my friend-’s mom at a pre-prom party. He
‘actually just stopped by my house in West Virginia with
his girlfriend ﬂiis past summer. They were on their way
back from California where he ‘was ﬁlming and were
driving this beautiful 1960 El'Camino with ﬂames paint-
ed on the front. Very cool.

TPN: What do you think when you look back on your

old issues?

Ward: The really early ones are terribly embarrassing,
but the newer ones are like a diary, only not as personal.
I get to see how I felt about things by what I chose to
write about, not by what I wrote. They show how I’ve
changed my way of thinking. You can’t write any old
crap and call it a zine — you really have to think it
through. ‘ . .

Interview conducted by Jennifer Meccariello, arts &
entertainment editor:

but this summer it was just too hard, so I .

I wanted my TV

_ i I didn’t grow up watching
 MTV —— in fact, it wasn’t
‘ until l1tl1 grade that my
parents ﬁnally
broke down
and got wired
for sound  and
movies and sports
and everything else
that came with our new
RCA satellite pack-
age.

   
    
 
 

Yes, we
were one of the
I unfortunate
, families whose
driveway measured longer than the local cable ‘com-
pany was willing to, uh, cable. We were quite happy
watching our three networks and Fox, getting up
every 15 minutes or so to adjust the rabbit cars.
This lack of cable didn’t really affect my little
brother and me (although I’m not sure if it ever
affected him to the degree that it got to me) until we
hit middle school.

 

Suddenly it wasn’t enough to read “Seventeen” «

and the long-‘gone “Sassy” to get the scoop on my
favorite hair band, fall fashion and Whitney

— Houston’s latest ﬁlm. Kids were no longer playing

catch after school — they were sitting down with
remotes (gasp!) and a plate of cookies and tuning in
and deﬁnitely rocking out. ' I

By the time ninth grade rolled around I was‘
wallowing deep in cablelessness. Conversations
would go right over my head. —— no, I did not see the ’
last episode of “Clarissa Explains It All.” And no, I

don’t remember where I was when I heard that Skid

Row broke up (which is a‘dumb question, because
wouldn’t I have been in my living room, watching
TV?) — and I sat on the precipice of utter dorkdom.

So where do I get the nerve, the moxy, to
bestow upon myself the title of arts and entertain-
ment editor (I really didn’t bestow it upon myself,
there was a hiring process involved)? Research, my
pets, long and arduous research.

I have watched every MTV special there is that
chronicles its inception, baby"-sat at every home that
offered early bedtimes and unblocked charmels and
spent long nights on the Internet looking for the
answers to all of my pressing entertainment ques-
tions. It’s taken ﬁve long years, but I think I’ve man-

aged to catch up to where the average 21-year-old I

should be —-. the ones’ whose parents monitored their
intake and  them to so many hours a day.

So, did I plummet off the looming precipice of
dorkdom? Most would say, emphatically, yes.
That’s OK, though. It was a pleasant fall, and it land-
ed me in the cushy place I now call home .— nerd
land. L . A .

If you were lucky enough to catch Less
Than Jake on the Vans Warped Tour you
were given the opportunity to get a preview
of three songs —— “Suburban Myth,” “Hell

 
  

Looks A Lot Like L.A.”
and “Gainesville Rock
City” — off their upcoming
album, Borders and Boundaries.

The album, due in stores on Oct 24,
marks the band’s sixth full—length studio
album. Fans crowded around the listening
station in the Less Than Jake Warped Tour
tent, optimistic about the new release, con-
sidering that several changes have taken
place in the band recently.

Formed in 1992 as a punk trio .in
Gainesville, Fla, Less Than Jake toured
constantly and released multiple indie—label
albums. Said to be a key part of the

equipped Kitchens, cable TV, VCR, free local phone, parking

ska/punk explosion, they eventually gtadu-J

ated ﬁom basement shows and worked

their way up to large venues, where they

caught the attention of Capitol Records.

After spending ﬁve years on Capitol
Records, Less Than Jake opted to retum to
their independent roots, meaning a more
hands-on approach for the band, which is
something that has always been important
to them. Less Than Jake have always been
true to their DIY attitude, booking their
own shows, producing their own albums
and designing their own merchandise. The
band has always worked to keep merchan-
dise and ticket prices as low as possible,
making its music“ more accessible to its
fans, as well. ,

Their upcoming album will be released

on Fat Wreck Records, run by Fat

Mike, the frontman of

NOFX. Hello, Rockview,

the band’s last album, is

an explosive mix of

horns, punk, pop and

even a little metal thrown

in for good measure. The

music is fun, the messages are seri-

ous, and these. guys love every minute of
perfonning.

In the past few years Less Than Jake
have been evolving into a more political
band as well, playing With the Ska Against
Racism Tour and working with Anti-Racist
Action.

Irrespective of political seriousness,
Less Than Jake fans are guaranteed a show
that will kick ‘em in the pants and get ‘em
dancing. A

In 1984, while Britney

spears and Christina     t    

Aguilera were tod-  _
dling around in dia— 
pers biding their time, 
Dinosaur Jr, led by J 1  
Mascis, was releasing
their ﬁrst of seven albums.

The band was a precursor to the Seattle

  
  

TH: P111 News

The catchy “All The Girls” has a slow- '

er tempo than most of’ the songs on the

album, but don’t be fooled —_ Mascis is not ’

a rock ballad kindof guy. He’s here to make
you jam in your ﬂannel. “Wastin,” one of the
gooﬁer tunes, has a rolling intro that would
do Romper Room proud. Be sure to listen
for the chirping birds that suddenly appear
toward the end of the song.

If you own every Dinosaur Jr album,
even the live ones, More Light won’t disap-
point you. Even though today’s

Top 10 charts are domi-
nated by ex-
, Mouseketeers,

gone the way of Kurt Cobain, and so had
- Dinosaur Jr’s record sales.

The band dissolved in 1997 just as ‘N

‘power over mainstream radio waves.

More Light is Mascis’ ﬁrst solo album
of new material. He may have changed the
moniker to J Mascis + The Fog, but the
Dinosaur Jr sound is still there. Mascis has
stayed true to his roots dishing out 11 alter-
native/grunge ditties that hearken back to the
days of “Singles” and “Reality Bites.”

Mascis, who plays as though he were
the bastard son of Joe Satriani and Thurston

rs  
suspensions to top Kent State

DAVID TUKNER

Managing Editor

When you hear that the Golden Flashes are in town,
you may expect to see some lightning. True, there was a
great deal of lightning Saturday at Three Rivers Stadium,
but very little of it came ﬁom the Kent State team.

In a very strange game that feat11red multiple suspen-
sions, both of the game -4 which was delayed over an hour
due to lightning —— and of players, the visiting team was
unable to manage more than one score, losing to Pitt 30-7.

Itbecameapparentthatthe gamewouldbe anunusual
one before the band played the alma mater. Through .a
release, Pitt announced that six players on the team had been
suspended_ for the game for “disciplinary reasons dating
back to the prior school year.”

The Panthers had much better luck on the ﬁeld, scoring
in their second possession. After throwing his ﬁrst two pass-
es. incomplete to wide receiver Latef Grim, Turrnan hit
Grim on a 19-yard post pattern putting the Panthers on their
own 46-yard line. A

the task, steadily charging from its own side of the ﬁeld to

Pitt’s 39-yard line. Then, they fell apart. After incurring two .

consecutive false start penalties, quarterback Zach Wdlianrs
threw a sharp pass to ﬂanker Matt Cuny, who fell on the
play. Comerback Shawn Robinson jumped in front of the
fallen receiver and collected his ﬁrst career interception. .

Pitt?s offense was not able to take advantage -of the
momentum that it created. Turrnan became inconsistent at
best, throwing the ball short or to no one in particular, and
running back Kevan Barlow managed only 13 yards in the
opening period. -. V

The loudest cheer the crowds managed was when they
learned of Toledo’s 24-6 upset of Penn State. .

VV1th only 2:28 _left in the ﬁrst quarter, Kent’s Jurron
Kelly ﬁelded a Jay Junko punt at his own 32-yard line, only
to have «oﬁicials suspend the game with thunder and light-
ning overhead.

When the skies cleared a little — 19 minutes later —
game resumed and Kent took advantage of the time off and
marched down ﬁeld over the next four minutes

128 yards, which included an 80-yard touchdown
reception, courtesy of quarterback David Priestley.

Harris better
make a decision
on quarterbacks

" Does anyone know what goes
through the mind of Pitt head foot-

ball coach Walt Harris? I sure,
V don’t. A

This column isn’t meant to crit-
icize Harris, because he has done a
wonderful job in his three—plus sea-
sons atthe helm of the Panthers.
However, he
decisions that I just don’t under-
stand.

For instance,'look at the Pitt
quarterback situation. After seeing
the opening game against Kent
State, it became painfully obvious
to me that Harris has‘already made
his decision on who he wants to win
the job, and that’s David Priestley.

That doesn’t mean that Priestley
will be declared the starter for this
weekend’s game against Bowling
Green. I have no idea who Harris

"will choose. However, in the end,
1 Priestley will get the job. ‘

Priestley missed spring practice .
’ with a shoulder injury and was

clearly outplayed by Turman in pre-
season camp and ‘throughout the
first weeks of practice, but yet

Harris still alternated both quarter- _

backs in Saturday’s contest against
Kent State. Well, I guess you can
call it alternating when one player
(Turman). plays about one quarter
of the game, while the other
(Priestley) comes in during the sec-
ond quarter and doesn’t leave the
game. ‘

Both players had their moments .

against the Golden Flashes.
Turman, a senior, got the Panthers
into the end zone on their ‘second
possession with a long pass to R.J.
English followed by a 6—yard slant

. . to Lamar Slade.

Priestley, a junior, followed that
with touchdown passes to Slade and
English in the second half. Neither
quarterback was intercepted on the
afternoon.‘ ‘

ing both players an equal amount of
time to earn the starting spot, but if
they remain even in the coach’s
eyes, whatis the deciding factor?’

The encouraging factor for the
Panthers is the running of Kevan

No matter who is playing quar-

the long passes that Priestley and
Turman both completed Saturday.

Harris needs to decide on a

Syracuse with an uncertainty at the
most’ important position on the
field. ; A

istry with running back Kevan Barlow. That
is, until the heavens bellowed again.
Barlow rushed for gains of 18 and 8
yards and collected Pn'est1ey’s 16-yard pass,
before the game was again called for rain.

- The rain may have stopped the players,
but it did not prevent Pitt fans in the student
section from having a good time.

Amid a downpour so thick ‘that red
seats seemed pink from the other side of the
stadium, the faithful fans cheered when a

boom of thunder sounded and chanted,

“Penn State sucks” for no particular reason.
“That was a weird deal,” Hanis said.
“I’ve never experienced that before. I think

that had some effect on some of our conti-

nuity.”

When the game reconvened almost 45
minutes later, the Panthers were forced to
settle for a ﬁeld goal, and momentum was
once again lost.

Pitt scored another ﬁeld goal as the half

, ended and because of stiﬂing defense, kept

their opponents on their side of the ﬁeld.

The Panthers’ defensive efforts for the
rest of the game were tremendous, as the
team gave Kent short, quick passing plays
and screens, but forced receivers to earn
extra yards.

After trading futile series, the Panthers
were ﬁnally able to put the ball in the end
zone again shortly after the nine-minute
mark of the third quarter, led by the great
individual efforts of wide receiver Slade.

First, Priestley threw a low bullet to
Slade, who caught the ball from his knees
on the right sideline.

The next play, Slade ran a fade and
slipped behind‘ the defenders. Priestley hit
him in stride and Nick Lot2’s extra point
gave the Panthers a 20-7 lead.

Kent worked their way back to Pitt’s
30-yard line and sent their kicking squad out
to cut the lead to 10, but Ryan Smith put his
hand on the ball, blocking the kick and ruin-
ing the hopes of the visitors.

If that wasn’t enough, the Panthers
scored an 80-yard touchdown to open the
next series. English sprinted down the right
sideline behind comerback J acon Avery and
ﬁnished oﬁ" tying the fourth—longe-st touch-
down pass in Pitt’s histoiy.

Harris said after the game that English’s
play, which received more time than usual
because of the player suspensions, was crit-
ical to the team’s success. '

“[1-Ie] had two catches for 128 yards;

that looks awful good to me,” he said. ‘That .

80-yarder was huge. I think that was aback-
breaker.” 0
Harris also indicated ﬂiat the quarter-
back race probably is not over.
“We want to make the correct choice
because the best quarterback will allow us to
be as good as we can be on offense,” he

‘said. “So we’re still trying to decide on that

position. _ i

. “To me, I gotta see consistency,’.’ he
said of Turman and Priestley. “It’s diﬂicult
to call plays when you’re inconsistent, and
that’s my challenge to those guys.
Fortlmately, it didn’t haunt us today.”

later, Turman hooked up with Slade on a
6-yard quick slant, to put Pitt up 7-0.

f‘[He] had two catches for 128 yards;
that looks awful good to‘ me,” he said.
“That 80-yarder was huge. That was a
back breaker.” '

On Pitt’s eighth drive, Slade caught a 1

ball over the rriiddle for a 28-yard touch-
down to put Pitt up, 20-7. Slade, a 6-foot-
4-inch, 205-pound sophomore, did not see
much playing time last season with just
seven catches for 30 yards.

Before the catch, Kent State was still
lurking, down by the score of 20-7. The
English catch ended all hopes of keeping
the game within reach. ’

“That play was as easy as it gets,”

Priestley said. “R.J-. English is probably _

the fastest guy on the ﬁeld. All I had to do
was put it out there and he took off with
it.” ‘ A
English, a 6-foot—3—inch, 215-pound
junior, was redshirted last season after he
tore his anterior cruciate ligament .during
spring drills, and he said he was ready for
a breakthrough.
“After last year I needed something.
My knee wasn’t ready yet and I really
needed this game,” English said.
, Grim said that he was really excited
about how his counterparts stepped up.
“Lamar and R.J. dida beautiful job,
I’m really excited. about them,” Grim said.
“It means that teams can’t just key in on
one of us anymore.” ‘
