Talks Baseball

He will discuss “Pittsburgh

ORay King, assistant to the Dean of

Students, concerning the reasons
for the judgment handed--down in
this case_ ' _ _

At’ Monday's emeeting, Jim Har-
rison, treasurer of SGA, presented
the above motion in response to
the fraternity’s appeal to the new
of SGA.
Harrison gave
why'the judgment should be re-
considered.

Stude'nts»Not Asked

“No student judicial body was
invited to participate in this de-
cision,”V he stated, “and there was
no privilege of appeal ~-granted to
the involved fraternity. There has
been inconsistency in recent judg-

ments regarding other fraternity

violations of accepted conduct.
.“'l‘here is also an apparent
lack of clarity as to how such
violations, will be handled. It is
further suggested that a clariﬁ-
cation be made of the position
of the Dean of Students oliice
with regard to jurisdiction in

similar conditions,” Harrison
concluded.
In an interview with Miss

Reynolds, _Mr. King stated that the
ruling of social probation was im-
posed because the fraternity vio-
lated‘ three University rules, in
regards to social events on cam-
pus. ~
, 3 Rules Listed
The speciﬁc rules are: a frater-
nity is not allowed to serve alco-
holic beverages at social func-.
tions; any ‘ event- which involves
university women must be regis-
tered with the university; and all
social events must be chaperoned.
In regards to_ the recent expul-
sion of the three fraternities
from'Spring carnival, Mr. King
had this to say:
The fraternities -— Delta Tau
Delta, Phi Epsilon Pi and Pi
Kappa Alpha—were tried by the

. Interfraternity ‘Judiciary Council

because no University rule was
violated. He said there is no Uni-
versity rule that says “a frater-
nity shall not steal lumber for a
Spring Carnival front.”

“I TAKETT YOU'VE NEVER HAD FENCING LESSONE?”

  Explainf Increased Fee  

The doubling ofthe University fee is a most unpopular
moveby the University for a number of valid reasons.

.No student doubts the need of the University fofrnoney,

but their announcement of this increase did not show the

special need at this time. The student has a. right to know.

what provoked a ‘completely unexpected raise of this sort.
I The University fee -has increased more, proportionally,
-than has the tuition. In 1954-55, tuition was $14 per credit

'with a $12.50 University fee. . »

In 1955-56, tuition was raised to $16 per -credit"; still’ a
_$12.50 fee. In 1956-57,“ the fee remained the same, but an
emergency ﬁve dollar Student Union fee was added. V-It

, must .be remembered that no portion of the University fee

is used forstudent activities, as so. many students believe.
The big tuition raise and increase of'the—UI_1iversity fee

A I took place in June, 1957. Tution was upped to $23 per credit,
I ‘ University fee to two dollars per credit for. the ﬁrst 12
"credits. The fee amounted to $24 for all full-time students.

Now, two years after this raise, the University fee is_
again doubled. Since 1957, the University fee has succes-

» Asively jumped from $12.50 to $24 to $48 with no sufficient
‘reason why. ‘ - ‘

The second major reason why this seems an unwar-

iranted move to students was that administrators were ex-
» plicit ‘in statingrthere would be no tuition raise. To the stu-

dent, this is nothing buta disguised tuition increase of two
dollars per credit. ’ ' j ' _

Not only is it an increase, but it affects those able to pay
as well as those unable to pay. Most scholarships do not in-
clude payment of fees. Thus, even with all the discussion-
about increases in scholarship aid, the University is asking
many of its scholarship students to shell out nearly $150
in University fees for the three trimester of next year.

To a student short of funds, such an increase might
serve _-as reason enough not tojattend the third trimester.
Instead of encouraging attendance, this raise will help dis-
courage it. ‘

Spring Sparks Zany

By David Breakstone

I must have missed April, somehow. With storm
clouds and opaque wetness always in my eyes, I
saw few flowers, felt fewer gentle breezes, and
heard no turtle—(dov/e’s) voice in my. part of the
land. I blame the Russians for 
stealing April, but then, I us-
uallyblame the Russians for all
my disappointments. It’s not
only convenient to blame them,
but also patriotic.—.

.My theory is that the Bus-
sians have been given a special
extension on .the Geophysical
Year (G. O. Fizzicul, if you like
Kelly) in order to inaugurate a
new ﬁve-year plan. Anyway, their phny uicists are

'still up on an Arctic ice iloe manipulating the

clouds with missiles and muscatel,.perverting the
would-be spring weather with .red—eye.glee. So,
although April‘ has slipped casually by, I haven”:
noted a great deal of the kind of atmosphere which
might be described as “springy.”

- Despite the absence of the
weather, followers of the Muse on college campuses
kept their eyes on the calendar. When the 15th of
April ‘fell due, the ancient customs and traditions
began ‘to be resurrected. The pagan wedding of
Mother Earth and Father Sky had to start on

schedule. Carnivals, festivals, track meets, picnics, '

popped up like so‘ many wildly-sown» crocuses.

lvies. Hear Fidel ., - — i

The celebrations were bizarre in some‘ sections.’

of the country. In some instances, this was due to
the nature of the revelers. Take Princeton and
Harvard, for example. Admittedly, here the revel-
ers pride themselves on aptness and originality of
capers, in any season. _

_ The Tigersand the Cantabs scorned frolicking
in the rivers or attacking the “townies” with deep-
frozen snowballs. They eveniput aside the thought

of soft lights and Lester Lanin. -They brought off

the coup of the "spring by inviting Fidel Castro for
entertainment. And the hero.of the New Year’s Day
revolution proved a splendid selection. At Prince-
ton he talked to a “governmental seminar.” Har-
vard dispensed with the scholarly euphemism and
opened the college ﬁeld house for the spectacle.

With characteristic candor and dead-pan sin-
cerity, Fidel hailed Harvard youth as the leaders
of tomorrow’s America. This seemed to please
them, no end. He promised that Cuba would take
her place, eventually,‘ as one of the hemisphere’s
shining lights. The stiidents then were, permitted
to ask Castro “serious, screened questions}? Here
the Liberator sparkled. — . _

In justifying the prolonged string of ‘military

‘executions, in defending the reasons for re-trial of

acquitted prisoners, in explaining why there would
be no elections for at least 18 "months, Fidel was

  

characteristic 9

  
  
 

the perfect showman. Each answer was vague,
circular, and punctuated by clever asides.. The
audience was delighted and enthralled by the
bearded-one’s verve. It was better than any home-
made variety show. —
District Sees Carnivals

"Closer to home, the celebrating was more mun-
dane, butnonetheless enthusiastic. The Seotchmen
at Tech put on their spring review which turned
out to be a musical comedy, of sorts. “Two hundred
people worked on this year’s production,” crowed
the program blurb. They could have used 200 more,
a few of them blessed with a little talent. The
carnival outside was all cotton candy and side

show gaiety, with a little mud thrown in for the‘ 7'

exuberant engineers, in whitepjackets.
The local revelers will be holdiiig forth this

week, despite the police and with the help of the .

ﬁrst sunshine of the year. Displaying will—power
and a respect for history, they have waited until
the snow melted and the rain stopped. ~

It would have been “the most colossal extrava-
ganza in Pitt Festival history” if a few of the con-
struction engineers hadn’t been caught borrowing
supplies. It was unfortunate the majority of the
engineers were smoother in operation. Without
much effort the remaining tent shows will out-
shine, the Tech ﬁasco.
Writers Witness Farce _

The Writers‘ Conference of last week provided-
a ﬁtting preview of our Spring revels and uncon-

‘ sciously rivalledthe Tech festivities. The afternoon

sessions were marked by the normal amount of con-
fusion, noise, and inattention. The bestwas saved
for 'last,,however, as this space noted on Monday.

With manners beﬁtting a Swiftian “Wahoo” and

‘intelligence. enough for the ‘bright second grader,

a young “author” taunted the speaker of the eve-
ning, «Saul Bellow, prize-winning novelist. The
audience apparently was in a frivolous mood, and
rather‘ than shout the attention-seeker down, it
indulgently let him rant away. Freedom of speech
is one thing, but unbridled license is quite another.
The nasty h\ead of the reveler had" appeared in a
most inappropriate place.

Adding insult to the obvious injury was" the

_ comfort which the clown received» from a pro.fessed_
scholar. The performance in its entirety was an 

embarrassing one for the English Department and
the University. Mr. Bellow deserved better at our
hands for his'c_ritical observations.

Comparisons are odious, but if I were_ forced to
pick the most novel of all the rites of spring, I
suppose that our own affair was the unintentional
prize-winner. The spirit of the season is infectious,
I suppose. Just how infectious I never realized be-
fore. In the future we-ought to set 0UI”F.6S“tiV81
preview a couple of months back. Either that, or
invite our“'guests. Happy weekend, revelers!

Audience as lVr0ng
As Balcony ‘Rebel’

Editor, The Pitt News: ,

The ‘young Rebel in the
balcony -on the night of Saul
Bellow’s speech, who counted
the slumbering and noted the
number that left, won himselfa
great deal of prestige inwthe act.

He will henceforth be known
as the -man who told Saul he
was not the world’s most dazz-

ling speaker. The rebel effective-.

ly demonstrated that reputations
such. as Bellow’s do‘not move
him to awe.gHe_ demonstrated,
too that he has a mind of his
own—though, since he accused
Bellow of incoherence, I cannot
vouch_ for its quality.

The Rebel was under no obli-
gation to be impressed with Bel-
low’s speech. If it bored him, he
had the alternative of joining
the _ranks of those he so care-

’ fully counted. But he didn’t; he
sat through what must have
been, for him, a tiresome talk,
merely to get the chance of "say-
ing that it was a tiresome talk:
for he said little more.

But neither was the audience
above the diséourtesy of voicing
its impatience with the Rebel,
which, if he is what I think he
is, is exactly what he wanted.
“Choke him,” suggested one fac-
'ulty member, in tones
enough to be heard for some dis-

 
  
 
 

loud ‘

a student. By its failure to re-
ceive the Rebel’s. opinions -with

- the appropriate silence, the audi-

ence showed it could express its

own, contrary opinions with
equal discourtesy. 
A l s 0, when Bellow said,

“Bring on‘ the nails,” that should .
' have signalled the end of all

debate on"the' subject. But no.
Half the audience ‘felt. d_uty-
bound to “get up and make a

condolence speech, thereby giv-I

ing the Rebel yet more satisfac-
tion and prolonging an embar-

rassing situation for Bellow.
Now the Rebel’s friends will
make a fuss over him, and wish
that they, too, had had the cour-
age to make Bellow. uncomfort-
able,’while: if the audience had
not carried "on so, he would have
a hard time explaining just how
he had not made a fool of him-

Jarrell in Bounds On

Carnival Statements

Editor, The Pitt News:

In The Pitt News of April 27,
Chris Gillotti and Henry Craig
stated that Kent Jarrell was
wrong in condemning the three
fraternities involved in the
“Lumber incident." These two
gentlemen seem to have a total
misunderstanding of what was

’ said" and A-meant by -Mr._‘Jarrel_l'. 
a ‘Mr: .Gi11.°“i..;.imaint6in§: .9uite 

 

--95?? 3.’?

  
   

wholly ‘a fraternity affair. It

could have been such if the de-k ~_
cision handed down by IF Judi- -‘

eial Commission had involved
only fraternities. However, two
groups of girls were greatly af-
fected .by the decision.

It is clear to me that IF Judi-
ciary could not have had sole
jurisdiction in .this case. The
fact that at the time there was
no clearly defined judicial body
to which the case should have
been takendoes not mean that
IF had sole jurisdiction.

Mr. Gilotti also told Mr‘. Jar-
rell that he better recognize the
limits of" SGA’s power. I am
quite sure. that "Mr. Jarrell
realizes that all student organi-
zations and extra—curricular ac-
tivities at the University come
under the jurisdiction of SGA.

If Mr. Gilotti would read
‘SGA’s constitution, he would
learn"that SGA wasoperating
completely within its_, bounds.
The constitution states, “In cases
of conflict between SGA, acting
within its constitutional respon-
sibiliies, and other -student or-
ganizations, the SGA shall have
ultimate authority.” Some of the
responsibilities SGA has are
“jurisdiction over all university-
wide student activities,” power
to “delegate tostudent organiza-
tions the authority to carry out
ulate student“conduct.” . - . :

‘The Jungle Cats, who are cur-

a step in the right‘ direction this
afternoon when ~ they. clash with
the Clarion State Teachers at

Wayne University will provide
the opposition for the Blue and

wood, and on Saturday the Mid-
shipmen of Navy will put in an
appearance at the Panthers’ home
diamond. The tilt with Wayne be-
gins at 3:30 while Saturday’s en-
counter with Navy starts at 1:30
p.m.
The Panthers have a score to
settle with the Middies since
they dropped a 7-4 verdict at
Annapolis last season, and two
.years ago Navy won in Pitts-
burgh by a margin of 7-5.
Thirdbaseman Matulevic, a 6-1
sophomore from Shaler Town-
ship, has been the most‘ pleasant
surprise of the campaign for the
Jungle Cats. “I ﬁgured that Jerry
might have a little difficulty ‘with

'his hitting this season since he's

just a newcomer, but he has been
pounding the ball with authority
so far,” Lewis replied.

JERRY MATULEVIC, Panther
third baseman, goes into today’s
game with a .380 batting aver-
age, high for the localnine. He
also is tied with Pete Colangelo
for the most doubles.

“He was a little jittery in the
ﬁeld also but just look at him now
and you would think that his
name was ‘Pie Traynor’ instead of
Matu1evic,” continued the Panther
skipper.

Asfar as a bid to the NCAA
playoffs, Lewis had this to say.
“If we can keep a clean slate
until the Penn State games (May
20) I guess we can then be
rated strong contenders, but
we’ll have to win at least one
game from State.” ‘

‘ “Four teams are selected for the
District 2 playoffs. Usually one
team is chosen from the New York
Metropolitan League consisting of
teams such as St. John's, NYU
and Manhattan.

Delaware Good Again

“Another squad is selected from
the Middle Atlantic League which
is comprised of Temple,.Vil1anova,

*2 . St. Joseph’s, Penn, La Salle, Buck-

nell, Delaware and Drexel. Dela-

ware was last year’s representa-

tive, and I hear that they are also
tough this season.

“It is also possible that both
Pitt and Penn State could be
invited since this happened once
before. During that particular
season the two teams didn’t play‘
each other, and since both
schools had outstanding records, _
the selection committee had no
other choice than to invite both
of us,” Lewis stated.

Two earlier ‘postponed games
have been rescheduled by the
Panthers. One of the two games
with California State will be play-
ed at California on May 14 and
the St. Vincent encounter has

been reset for May 25 at Wild- ,

wood. \

The‘ only other tilt at Wildwood
this season will be on May 16
with intra-city rival Duquesne.

After 3rd W/in.
At Villanmza

By JACKOSMITH

With two dual. meet victor-
ies against one defeat, under
their belt, the Panther track-
men.will travel to" Philadel-
phia Saturday in hopes of up-
setting a favorite Villanova
-team. '

According to Coach Carl Rees,
though, the Cats look better on
paper. “We'look a little stronger
in the distant running andin ﬁeld
events,” he said. “But with sprint
runners like Ed Collymore, Joe
Manion and Charles’ Stead against
you anything can happen.” The
meet, as far as the Panthers are

depth.

.Last week the Wildcats
swamped St. Joseph, 851/4;-401/2.
Villanova took every running
event except the half mile, but
their times in the distance races
were far under that of Rees’
runners. '

In the sprints, however, the
Wildcats have Manion, who runs
the 100-yard dash in 9.7 seconds;
‘Collymore, who does the 440-yard
dash in 46-plus secondsand who
was the national 220-yard dash
champ last year; and Stead‘ who is
an allround trackman.

Rees will counter by running
Mel Barnwell, Jay Moody and
Bill Bannow against the Wild-
cats in the sprints.

In the ﬁeld events Rees will look-
for a ﬁrst and second place in the
discus and shot put from Dan
Kanell "and Larry Och. Ed Vamos,
who broad jumped 23 feet, 7%
inches in last week’s meet with
West Virginia, could upset Villa-
nova’s John Buckey who leaped
25 feet last year. '

Unblemished Panther Netme-n.

This Thursday the Panther net-
menlmwill put. their unblemished
4-0 record on the line when they
meet, for the second time, the
netters from Westminster. "In their
ﬁrst meet with Westminster, the
Panther netmen were just able to
squeak out ‘a 5-4 victory. -

“I’m expecting
again,” Coach Bill Summers re-
ported, “but the team has done
a lot of improving since then, and
I don’t think l’ll have to sweat
this one out.” It willbe noted also
that Westminster will have a dis-
tinct advantage in that the meet
will be played on its home court.

     
 
   

Saturday the Panthers will '

travel to Bethany, TV. Va., to
play the netters from ‘Bethany
College in what Coach Summers
predicts “will be one of the
toughest meets of the season.
