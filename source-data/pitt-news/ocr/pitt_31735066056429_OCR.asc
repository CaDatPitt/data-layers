Approval granted for shuttle system

Byjohn Temple
sum’ Writer

In an effort to increase campus
security, last month the Board of
Trustees approved transportation
system additions which will cost
full—time students 530 per temi and
part-timers 512.

The trial run during finals week
of the new all-clay North and South
Oakland shuttles and Sutherland
Hall bus helped iron out the details
of the 32 million improvements,
Director of Transportatio‘n john
Worgarr said.

“Because of the decreasing stu-
dent population cluiing finals week,
we didn’t have a whole lot of rid-
ers,” Morgan said, “but we learned

a lot about traffic patterns, street V

patterns and garbage pickup which
will help this term.”

The system has attiactecl increas-
ing numbers of students since the
spring term began last week,
Morgan said. Although the clepart-
ment has already pr'intecl’2l,()()()
schedules outlining the e.\'panclecl-
system, Morgan said that many stu-
dents do not understand all the
facilities the entire system has to
offer.

“\Vei‘e getting calls from people
who say they cliclnt even know we
have a shtrttlc system," Morgan
said.

An escort seiyice to begin opera-

Vice Chancellor for Student
Affairs, Dr. William Hannon, said
that there are times when he
wished students would go away;
but over the holidays he does miss
them.

He said that Pitt is a ghost town
without students. Even though he
can get a parking place and he
does not have to wait in line at the
 he still misses the students.

“\‘</hen the students are gone,”
he saicL "it really brings home the
basis for being here."

He said that the best thing about
his job is “interacting with an inter-
esting group of students —— the
wide ra.nge of activities and
involvement of the divisions is an
important aspect of what I do."

Hannon said that he is disturbed

that sometimes students make’

what he consiclers to be "inappro-

priate clecisions,“ like underage

drinking and excessive partying
"out in the community."

He said that these decisions
cause clif'fic'ultic-s for themselves

\

and Q[llCI‘S with which they have
contact.

According to Harmon, the per-
centage of students on campus
that make inappropriate decisions
is small but noticeable because Pitt

‘ has such a high percentage of stu-

dents who do want to make a
positive A difference for themselves,
the university and their peers.

.His advice for students is “get
involved in the university commu-
nity." '

“Become active participants in
education rather than recipients of
eclucation," he said. “The most
important factor, especially for first-
year students, is that it gets better.
And better means that as they
develop in the univ ‘rsity commu-
nity, lstuclentsl become selective
about those things that are impor-
tant.

“And while peer pressure is also
a factor‘, it becomes less of a pro-
hibiting factor as stuclent.s develop
their own goals and objectives," he
said.

Harmon admires a football
poster in his office that says, “You
don‘t always have to have the lead

if you have the heart to come from
behind."

Hannon’s main responsibility as
vice chancellor for Student Affairs
is being in charge of different Pitt
divisions: International Services,
Student Health Service, Student
Activities, Residence Life,
Counseling and Student
Development Center, Placement
Service and New Student
Programs. Then there are subsets
under each of those divisions.

“Essentially my role is in the
divisions and adding administrative
support for various departments. It
is to provide a level of support in
out—of-classroorn experiences,” he
said. “I enjoy what I do.”

He completed his undergradu-
ate work at a small, predorninantly
black school, Johnson C. Smith
University, in Charlotte, N.C. He
received his masters degree from
Seton Hall and his doctorate from
 State University.

Before he became involved in
the administration side of higher
education, he was onthe academ-
ic side. He taught in health aclmin—
istration at the University of

Medicine and Dentistry in New

Jersey.

He then started to advise stu-
dents and liked that aspect of high-
er education. He said the more
and more he became involved
with students, the more he
enjoyed that level of involvement.

He said maybe later in the
future, he will return to teaching
health administration, but he
would have to go back to school
because the discipline has
changed so much.

Before he came to Pitt, he

‘worked at Wichita State University.

He was assistant dean for
Academic and Student Affairs of
the College of Health Professions.
Then, he was promoted to clean of

University College (equivalent to

Pitfs College of Arts and Sciences)
and finally assistant president of
Student Affairs at Wichita.

“I see a. strong relationship
between academics and student
affairs,” he said. “You cannot sepa-

rate what happens to a student in

or outside the classroom.”

Retired persons leave the wor/e force and bead back to college

By Kelly B. Casey

Photography Editor

Editor’s Note: This is the first
part of a two part series.

When Elsie Fazekas was 7
years old, she and her father
boarded the trolley in
Homestead, which took them
into Oakland where they spent
the day at the Carnegie Museum.

Although that was over 60
years ago, she remembers the
day like it was yesterday. “It was

_ a rainy Sunday afternoon,” as

they walked down Forbes
Avenue past Forbes Field.

“My father pointed to a struc-
ture across the street and said,
‘See that building over there?

.That’s the school you’ll go to

someday?” He pointed to the
half-built Cathedral of Learning,
which that year had just begun
to be constructed.

Because of the Depression,
Fazekas could never afford to
send his daughter to the “sky—
scraper school.” In 1987, at the
age of 68, Fazekas finally went to
college.

She, along with a 614 students
over the age of 55, registered last
semester for Pitt classes ranging
from anthropology to theater
arts, said Jan White, the 60—Plus

Program coordinator. The num-
ber of students spending part of
their “golden years” at Pitt has
more than doubled over the last
five years.

Pitt’s increase in senior popula-
tion has kept up with Allegheny
County’s senior boom. Although
the county's population has
decreased by more than 100,000
during the past 10 years, the
over—60 population has grown to
around 500,000 — nearly 60 per-
cent of the total population.
Pennsylvania is second only to
Florida in its number of seniors.

All over the country thousand .
of retirees are hitting the books
rather than pool—side shuffle-
board and golf courses.

As of 1989 Census Bureau sta-
tistics estimate some 520,000
Americans over the age of 50
registered for classes.

When Wilfred King graduated
from Pitt in 1949 with a business
administration degree the last
thing he thought of was going
back to school. But when he
retired 10 years ago, it was the
first thing that came to mind
when he asked himself, “What
the hell am I going to do now?”

King is now carrying a five-
class load, including classes in
philosophy (which he laments is
“way over his head”), communi-

the past 10 years, King boasts he
has filled “thousands of note-
books full of notes,” although he
does not have to do any of the
homework or take any exams.

King and other older students
agree “that this is the way you
should go to school — no pres-
sures.”

World War II veteran Neil
Hamilton, who jokingly refers to
himself as an “old cuss,” said he

feels guilty because he has got it

so much easier than the younger
students.

dents‘ concerns were expressed
to the SGB. then the SGB
expressed them to the Task
Force and administration.

This all formulated a very big

part in the Task Force‘s recom- .

mendation, Bender said.

"Good communication," he
said. “This is the perfect example
of student government.”

Brody added that the new

' transpot'tation system came out

of the SGB office. He researched
the legal and libel sides of the
escort seryice.

-Not only did the board help
achieve the transportation and
safety goals, but so did the SGl$’s
Public Safety Committee. At the
beginning of their term. the SGB
members reorgani'/.ed this com-

mittee.

Committee chairperson Shahla
Eberhardt has done an excellent
job, many board members said.

SGB member Derrick St. Clair
said the committee never did
anything in the past, but that

Eberhardt took the committee

and made it visible.

“We built up the Safety
Committee from virtually noth-
ing," SGB member Christopher
Skutches said.

He said that currently the corn-
mittee is the most active commit-
tee under SGB, apart from the

Allocations Committee.

The Public Safety Committee
tested campus phones. increased
lighting around campus, deter-
mined safe walking routes,
established shuttles to parties,

petitioned against the 2.7 percent
reduction in public safety fund-
ing and designed a safety guide
which will be distributed this
month.

The committee also organized
“Take Back the Night" in April,
where 100 students marched
through North and South
Oakland and let their voices be
heard about crime and campus

safety.

The committee can get more
done, Golden said, because the
committee members are there
for longer than one year.

-During the middle of last
February, Brody worked on
implementing the Van Call ser-
vice so that students could be
picked up and taken anywhere
in North or South Oakland.

-After a female Pitt student
was sexually assaulted last March
coming home from a fraternity
party, SGB called for improved
campus safety, which resulted in
additional safety seminars and
forums for students.

-St. Clair and Bender worked
with the Crime Stop project.
Crime Stop is where students
can report crime to a captain,
who is located on each resi-
dence hall lloor. The captains
then report the crime to the
SGB.

Although it is still in the begin-
ning stage, Bender said that peo-
ple are participating. There were
two safety seminars for the vol-
unteers. Bender said he plans on
getting in touch with a new
board member to keepthis pro-

initiative of the SGB, St. Clair
said.

°St. Clair said that because of
a student’s concern of dulling
paint on the crosswalks, he
looked into the problem. He was
successful with that because
crosswalks were painted.

“Everything we have done
lwith safety and transportation]
has been incredible,” St. Clair
said.

“Board members are always
making voices known,” St. Clair
said.

The SGB worked to expand
Choice Dollars. Brody and board
member Dan Leichter went
around to a few restaurants and
wrote some letters. They took
their proposals to the administra-
tion and now Pizza Hut is under

_ Choice Dollars. Pamela’s and

The North Oakland computer
lab that was suggested by mem-
bers was shot down by the
administration. Leichter said that
the administration said it was
impossible; because of the
money and facilities.

The course evaluation, guide,
which was started by Golden,
has been passed to SGB’s
Academic Affairs committee and
is still in the planning process.
SGB member Ross Pasquale said
that Golden and he met with the
Educational Policies committee
and were given some critical
feedback.

An open forum between stu-

forums were held during the
fall where students voiced
their concerns about sexual
assaults, safety and trans-
portation to Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor, Assistant
Vice Chancellor of Business
and Finance John DeVitto,
Vice Chancellor of Student

Affairs William Harmon and’

other administrators.

A cultrrral diversity commit-
tee was established under
SGB to increase students’
awareness of Pitt’s culturally
diverse campus.

The improved
Miscellaneous guide did not
go too far. “It got out of con-
trol,” SGB member
Christopher Skrrtches said. He
said that it became a night-
mare and they ran into mone-
tary problems.

Leichter had proposed the
mural idea for the wall
between‘ Hemingway’s and
the Towers steps. It was shot

down by the administration.

There was an extension of
cafeteria hours by Marriott,
Pitt’s food service. In the
Towers, Lothrop Hall and
Sutherland Hall cafeterias
breakfast is served Monday
through Friday from 7 a.m.
until 9:30 a.m. A continental
breakfast is served from 9:30
a.1n. until 10 a.m., and lunch
is served between the hours
of 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. Dinner
is served on Monday through
Thursday from 4 p.m. until 7
p.m. Friday through Sunday
Dinner is sewed between the
hours of 4 p.m. and 6:30 pm.
Brunch is served on Saturday
and Sunday from 10:30 am.
until 1 p.m. Lothrop Hall’s
cafeteria is closed on the
weekend.

Board member Barbara
Rodriguez also said that she
talked to people at Roy
Rogers about the restaurant
being open on Sundays, but
nothing was established.

islands is much more of a reality
than a week-long cruise. Each
class costs only $15, although the
older students are not allowed to
take labs and they have to wait
until regular registration ends.

“Once they’re hooked, they’re
hooked,” said White, referring to
the large number of older stu-
dents who corne back every
semester with a seemingly insa-
tiable appetite for knowledge.
Most of them agree that they’ll
keep coming back “until the
undertaker comes after me.”

Still, going back isn’t all that
easy for some.

As 68-year-old Fazekas, who
had not been in class since 1955,
got off the bus and headed for
her class, she was so nervous

me."

She_ was so amtious she arrived
a half an hour early and got a
big surprise when the "curly-
lieaded youngster” who arrived
after her turned out to be her
professor.

Today she looks back on that
summer she spent two—and-a-half
hours a day, five. days a week
studying German with a dozen
other students, as one of the best
ever. “I enjoyed that summer
more than any other for many
years,” she said, noting that she'll
never forget the “youngsters” she
had met.

Hamilton agrees that the best
part of the program is the stu-
dents. “The young people are
phenomenal. They accept you
and you become one of them."

Other older students don’t
mingle as much. King said he
does not interact with many of
the younger students because
“they have their own lives to
worry about.”

“I got cold feet,” she said look-
ing back on that day. She said
she thoughtto herself, “How can
I go into this class with all these
young people? T hey’ll laugh at

On the lower campus,
Brennan is also looking into
designating South Oakland
“safe houses," meaning
homes or businesses that
students can enter when in
danger.

“Campus safety is our
number—one concern,"
Assistant Vice Chancellor for
Business John DeVitto said
about the security measures.
“We believe that the new
transportation system and
escort service will improve
campus security and make it
easier and more convenient
for students to get around."

We all know the famed battle cry of the American
.Revolution ~— taxation without representation. This single
expression represents the ideal of the American democra-
cy. that most of us have come to take for a given.

Yet. while we boast in the history books a-hout our illus-
trious accomplishments during this period, the whole
notion that with taxation comes representation remains
but an empty idea for many American citizens. Imagine if
Washington. D.C.. decided to split from the union. Most
Americans prohahly shudder at the thought. And while it
is hardly a likely scenario given our history. they have the
rationale for doing so. I _

Fr>ur-and-a-half million people live in what are referred
to as Americanterritories. For a variety of reasons (such as
certain provisions of the constitution may not apply) these
territories are not considered part of the United States, but
the people are considered US. citizens or U .S. nationals.

Congress is now considering whether these people
should be given equal representation on the floor of the
House and Senate. Those opposed say that it is unconsti-
tutional —— citing Article 1. section 2 of the Constitution
wlrichsays that only direct representatives of the Union
should be included in voting procedures. Those for equal
representation appeal mostly on moral grounds.

During the Vietnam War. the territory of Guam lost more
people per capita than any state in the union with the
exception of Alaska. More recently. they lost three young
men in a war (Operation Desert Storm) in which they had
no voice as to whether or not they wanted to participate.

l“urthermore. these citizens of the United States are sub-
ject to the laws of the supreme court and most have to
pay federal income tax. .

There is no questionthat many of the Democrats who
support this_ initiative do so because it means a 5:1 voting
block in Congress. The same reasoning goes for those
Republicans who are opposed to it. But politics aside.
there are <i.§ million American citizens subject to many of
the same laws as everybody else in a country who are not
granted equal representatit)n.

‘As one (‘ruamanian delegate put it to his quasi-col-
leagtres in the House of Representatives. "I fill out the
same tax forms that you do and pay the same percentage
of my income as you do."

This is hardly a question of partisanship. and the solu-
tion should he a constitutional amendment which would
grant to these people full representation. Given the dire
economic circumstances of this nation. and some other
pr‘essing' problems. it is understandable that this is not an
issue that is on the minds of most people. Nevertheless.
this is an issue which demands the attention of the
American public. and if it is taken to a constitutional
amendment it should he passed. Or as recent history has
shown us. for many the whole notion of the American
ideal remai_ns nothing but a lie. '

DON‘T WORRY...

Hypocrisy permeates liberalism

In the past few months we
have witnessed an abandon-
ment of mor'ality.a fervent
increase in hypocrisy and
decidedly new levels of intol-
erance. Who is responsible? To
lay the blame on any one indi-
vidual would he gross over-
simplification, yet it is ternpt—
ing. Many come to mind. But
this frightening decline in
human decency is not the
heinous plot of any particular
ne'er—do-well. Rather, it is the
work of the amoral, multicul-
tural liberal faction of our
nation.

“What ho!“ one may exclaim
at this statement. But allow me
to elaborate before judgment is
passed. dear reader. Let’s
make this an educational expe-
rience for both of us, for]
learn as much from your
response as you learn from my
dissertation.

First. allow me to address
hypocrisy. as this is the easiest
to exemplify and is. at present.
running rampant through the
ranks of liberalism. To accuse
an individual or group of
hypocrisy is a touchy game
and should only he applied to
blatantly hypocritical occur-
rences. There are two of these
in the public eye today, the
first being Bill Clinton‘s deci-
sion to send Chelsea to a pri-
vate school.

Now wait. before you tell
me that “a child is not a tool

5 for the symbolic advancement

of a political idea" let me clue
you in to a few things you
may not have heard from the
left—wing media. First. if Bill
Clinton really believes that
public schools are in a better-
than-acceptable condition. his
decision cannot he justified.
Second. Chelsea would he in
no danger even at l)C's tough-

est PS. See (IS.-l '/‘or/(l_1"s article

from Jan. 6. She is constantly
surrounded by secret service.
So where is the outrage? There
is none. Instead. the media go
to Chelsea's new school to get

student feedback. \"(/hat is this?!

Bill Clinton is sending his
daughter to one of the. most
expensive schools in the city
and at the same time telling all
citizens that their children
must bite the bullet and go to
the "enlightened“ public

 

is
Diersen

schools, which aren't good
enough for his kids. How

about vouchers? Clinton’s
opposed. Of course he is. He

doesn‘t want his child going to

school with the unwashed
masses, would you? Why of
course not! No, the American
public wants to hear the head-
lines from USA 'l'odcty —— "It’ll
be Cool to go to school with
Chelsea."

eWhat about your kid, John
Q. Public? ‘Who does your kid
go to school with. and what

are they teaching your kid in"

school? I’ll tell you. Your kids
are going tothe schools that

_ people. like Clinton create and
"then

shun like a pariah.
Clinton doesn’t want his
daughter getting free condoms
or learning that it‘s great to
have two moms or a father
who has a homosexual lover.
That‘s what they’re teaching
kids in our public schools. but
you can bet they're not teach-
ing it at the Sidwell Friends
School. No. that‘s a re/1‘g1'ous
school. Come on Bill. \\"hat
you're doing is tantamount to

V telling the American public to

bet on the San Jose Sharks
while you place your bet on
the Pittsburgh Penguins right

in front of their eyes. What
hypocrisy!

Let’s not forget the
Packwood incident either.
Packwood (my least favorite
Republican) can spend years
sneaking kisses, grabs and
pinches, while locking women

in his office, proliferating his

lecherous habits without hard-
ly a peep fr_om the left. Why is
this? Because Packwood was a
staunch advocate of “women’s"
rights. Because he pandered to

the liberals, who are now so

baffled by his inexplicable
behavior.

But what about Clarence
Thomas? All he did was make
a simple advance at Ms. Hill
and he was subjected to inqui-

"V sitions, hearings and criticisms

from the lunatic fringe. This
must be because he’s such a
bad man right? It probably had
nothing to do with the fact that
he is a conservative black man
and probably opposed to Roe
vs. Wade, right?

Wrong. Thomas was lain-
basted because he opposed
the, liberal philosophy.
Packwood went unscathed
(i.e. the pathetic demonstration
staged by NOW on Jan. 6)
because he has espoused the
liberal cause. Such hypocrisy
should not be tolerated, but an
apathetic ptrblic combined
with _a left—leaning media
which the public accepts as
purveyors of fact leads to the
ridiculously naive acceptance
of such downright hypocritical
behavior.

So, dear reader. we see shin-
ing examples of governmental

‘hypocrisy daily in our society.

Decidedly. many more can be
found without any great effort

on my part. But space and

time impose their limits. and I
am out of both. Perhaps later

The calendar reads 1993, but for the Pitt
wrestling team it was déja vu 1992.

Last season Panther dual meets devel-
oped a gut-wrenching habit of coming
down to the final match. Thursday night
at Fitzgerald Field House, Pitt trailed
Lehigh 17-12 with two bouts remaining.
Junior Jeff Kloiber needed to come up big
again in the 190—pound class. And redshirt
freshman Pat Wiltanger, Pitt’s talented
heavyweight prodigy, needed to seal the
deal. ‘

Both came through and Pitt began its
dual—meet season with a stirring 19-17
victory over a strong Lehigh club. Pitt
head coach Rande Stottlemyer said he
expected his youthful bunch to gel slow-
ly, but was encouraged by its total team
effort against the Engineers.

“There was definitely some similarities
to [last yearl," Stottlemyer said. “But I feel

Wrestlers come back to top Lehigh inf 

were definitely gonna win a lot more
matches down low.”

Those lower weight classes developed
into a huge headache for Stottlemyer the
last few seasons. Redshirt sophomore
Mike Moore is well on his way to solving
that problem. Wrestling at 118, Moore
racked up an impressive record during

tournaments and started the Panthers’ '

engine Thursday by pinning David
Hardwick 1:16 into the second period.

Moore redshirted last season, sitting out

with a dislocated thumb, and hopes to
sure up a weight class that plagued Pitt
throughout ‘92.

"I think last year we were just a little
inexperienced in the lower weights,“
Moore said. "I think that I could have
helped out last year down there.”

Another young Panther looking to step
up in 1993 is sophomore j.]. Fasnacht.
After an up—and-down ‘92 season,
Fasnacht came up huge with a hard-
fought 3-2 decision over john McCumber

in the 134—pound weight class. This bout"
was tight from the outset with two min-
utes elapsing before Fasnacht scored the
lone takedown of the match for a 2-0
lead. He carried a 3-1 margin into the
final period and held on to give Pitt 21 9-3
lead in the match.

Moore said many of the younger
wrestlers have matured a great deal, cit-
ing Fasnacht especially, and said
Fasnacht’s win was the key point of the
entire match.

“It was a good win for us to start things
off, especially against a team like Lehigh,”
Moore said. “We’re a young team, and
well just keep getting better as the year
goes." 9

Fasnacht admitted that his performance
last season was subpar at times and also
feels that maturity and confidence are the
key differences at this point. He said
adjusting to his first year at Pitt, both on
and off the mats, was a trying experience.

THE PIT'I‘ NEWS, Monday, January 11, 1993

Men is basketball rolls to seven straight victories

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther basketball team, com-
ing off of an 80-66 loss at Big Fast rival
Georgetown, headed into the me.at of its
so-called preseason schedule as Pitt stu-
dents ended their finals and headed home
for Christmas break.

Dec. 12 — West Virginia

In last year’s hoop game at Mountaineer
Coliseum, then-freshman Jerry McCullough
missed vital free throws down the stretch
to allow the Mountaineers to steal a victo-
ry from the jaws of the Panthers in the last
minute of the game. 1

This time, McCullough made up for last
year's debacle by going 8-8 on the free-
throw line in the final eight minutes of the
game, which added tohis career-high 28
points for the game.

The pattern of an apparent Panther vic-

tory-was put in jeopardy as some late Pitt .

turnovers led to a WVU run in the last sec-

onds of the game.

This time, however, the Panthers were
able to keep the Mountaineers at bay, as
they missed a shot to tie the game with
less than a minute left, and Chris Gant
converted a fastbreak for a layup as Pitt
made up for last years loss with an 82-78
victory.

Dec. 19 — Duquesne

The Panthers headed to the downtown
Pittsburgh Civic Arena to play the cross-
town rival Dukes of Duquesne University.
Some years ago, this game was one of the
top sporting events of the year in
Pittsburgh when Pitt and Duquesne would
square off at the Civic Arena as members
of the same league.

As an effort to bring back the popularity
of the rivalry in the city, Duquesne opted
to move the game from its hometown
gym, the 6,200 seat Palumbo Center, back
to the 16,000 seat Civic Arena.

Duquesne beat nationally-ranked Florida
State by tenacious pressing defense. It

tried the same tactics against Pitt in an ‘

effort to combat the Panthers‘ potential
firepower, but the Panthers were able to
reel off fast—break points with ease and
were able to break Duquesne’s press
almost at will.

The key to the Panther victory was the
point guard matchup, as Duquesne’s start-
ing point guard Kenya Turner was held at
bay and forced into foul trouble in an
attempt to guard McCullough, who set a
new career-best with 29 points.

Midway through the second half Duke
forward Niksa Tarle punched Pitt forward
Orlando Antigua, which resulted in a ﬂa-

grant foul. Antigua sank all four free

throws to all but curb any hopes of a
Duke comeback.

Reserve forward Brian Brush also had
career highs with 11 points and nine
rebounds as Pitt went on to break the cen-
tury mark for the first time this season to
win 102-91.

The Cornell Big Red of the Ivy
League came to Fitzgerald Field House

just four days before Christmas and the _

Panthers almost handed The Big Red an
early present.

The starting Pitt five of Mobley.
McNeal, Shareef, Jones and McCullough
was benched just five minutes into the
game as Evans inserted reserves to han-
dle Cornell.

The reserves ended up getting han-
dled by Cornell, however, as the Red
led by as much as 10 points in the first
half, ending the half with a 40-32 lead.

The second half did not start out

I much better for Pitt, as Cornell came

out with all cylinders firing and scored
the first five points of the second half
to pull out to a 13-point lead.

The Panthers slowly clawed their way

back into the game and Antoine _Iones~
put Pitt ahead for good as he hit two.

free throws with 5:29 left in the game.
Both Eric Mobley and Garrick

Thomas had career-high nights with

Mobley scoring 17 points anci Thomas

scoring 15 to help Pitt pull out an 80-72

win over Cornell.
Dec. 23 — Robert Morris
Local rival Robert Morris has never

conquered Pitt. so the team was hoping
to catch the Panthers thinking of head-
ing to Grandma's house instead of play-
ing basketball on the eve of Christmas
Eve.

Pitts first point did not come until the
17:20 mark, when Mobley rebounded a
Colonial miss and rifled a long bomb to
wide receiver lviccullough for an easy
layup.

After trailing this game early. Pitt
pulled ahead roughly .halfway through
the first half and never looked back.

Pitt easily cruised to an 87-63 victory,
its biggest winning margin of the sea-
son up to that point.

Panther Coach Paul Evans expressed
his concern with his team playing an
entire 40 minutes solidly.

“I’m pleased with the teams play so
far this year — in the second half.
However, there are 40 minutes to a ball
game, not 20,” Evans said.

Dec. 28 — UCLA .

The Panthers had their work cut out
for them in the next game as 1(_)th—
ranked UCLA came to town to play the
Panthers at Pitt’s second game this year
at the Civic Arena.

The Panthers had no choice but to
perform for an entire 40 minutes or else

this game would be a replay of the last
time. these two teams met. The Panthers
traveled to UCLA only to get blown all
the way back to Pittsburgh in an
embarrassing 112-85 loss on national
TV.

Pitt remembered that day by playing
with such tenacity that it led to what
was undoubtedly the best performance
of the season up to that point, if not
one of the best performances by a
Panther basketball squad in some years.

Chris McNeal, who had been slump-
ing profusely coming into this game,
scored only two points in the last two
games. He awoke like a sleeping giant,
and it could not have come at a better
time. He played one of his best games
as a Panther, scoring 26 points, 10 on
outside shots, and also pulled down 12
rebounds.

The Panthers were able to control the
boards and out-‘rebound the Bruins 59-
35, against a UCLA team that was big-
ger and taller than Pitt.

The Panthers came out on fire this
game and led by as much as 13 points
in the first half, but the Bruins clawed
back to pull within seven at half.

In the second half, Pitt picked up
where it left off, scoring almost at will

by executing excellent ball handling
and movement. UCLA pulled within
five points on two separate occasions.
However, with just 4:44 Ieftin the
game. the Panthers exploded for a 14-5
run to finish the Bruins and send them
home bleeding this time, with the
Panthers pulling off the big 91-79 victo-
ry.

Starting. Pitt two guard Ahmad
Shareef. sprained an ankle during the
game. And Marlon Rhymes did an
excellent job off the bench with 12
points. McCullough and Antoine Jones
also scored in double figures.

Jan. 2 — Providence

The Panthers played their first Big
East game since their one. loss of the
season at Georgetown as they hosted
the Friars of Providence.

The big‘ question of the night was
how well McNeal would play. A rap
against McNeal for years was his inabil-

ity to play well two games in a row, .

but he silenced the skeptics by scoring
25 points and pulling down 9
rebounds.

Providence led most of the first half,

and at one point was up by nine, but

tPitt clawed back to regain the lead

Wrestling

Continued from page 9

“I have a lot more confi-
dence than last year, and a lot
more heart,” Fasnacht said.
“Sometimes I was scared to
wrestle last year, and when I
got behind I didn’t care as
much. I care a lot more this
year. I feel a lot more com-
fortable this year.” I
‘ Things turned tough for Pitt
when senior Steve Budman
(150) suffered a tough 4-1
decision to junior Steve
Cassidy, who is currently
ranked 10th in the nation at
150. Then Lehigh moved out

to a 13—9 lead after Brian-

Cipollone scored a 7-3 deci-
sion over sophomore Joe
Plouse at 158.

Returning NCAA-qualifier
Sean Gibbs put Pitt back on
track at 167 with an 8-6 deci-
sion over Brian Strunck.
Gibbs’ leadership takes on
added importance this season,
with him and Budman the
only seniors in the lineup.
Gibbs was not satisfied by his
individual effort, but said the
team benefitted a great‘ deal
from winning a tough match.

“I cut too much weight. I
ranvout of gas,” Gibbs said. “I
should have beat lStrunck] by
10 points  I thought one of
the most important things
tonight was some of the confi-
dence the young guys got,
like J.) Fasnacht  they’re not
freshmen anymore. They’re
veterans. A lot of guys that
were borderline last year
gained a lot of confidence
tonight.” 1

But Lehigh again stretched
its lead, moving out to a 17-12
margin at the 177-pound
weight class with Rick Hepp
scoring a 15-4 major decision
over Panther first—year
wrestler John Gilbeaut.

However, the contributions
from the lower classes placed
Pitt in perfect position with
Kloiber and Wiltanger finish-

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, January 11, 1993

ing up.

Kloiber missed Pitt’s first
two tournaments of the sea-
son recovering from
September knee surgery. He
returned to win four of five
matches while taking a third
place finish at the Wilkes
Tournament. Like Gibbs,
Kloiber said he cut too much
weight just before the match
and felt extremely tired. But
Kloiber said his mental focus
and preparation helped pull
him through.

“The big thing Sean lGibbsl
and I have been talking about
is staying intense when you’re
out there. As long as I keep
my intensity up I should be
alright,” Kloiber said. “I know
I can hang with the best in
the country. I’ve learned from
last year how to turn my
intensity on and off. You can’t
get too worked up over"
matches. You have to stay
relaxed beforehand. You gotta
be able to turn it on and off
when you want to.”

Wiltanger wrestled his first
Fitzgerald match with the fate
of the entire evening on his
shoulders. All of the one-on-
one battles he waged with
departed Panther All-
American Perry Miller in prac-
tice helped prepare him, but
Wiltanger realizes how quick-
ly the spotlight has shifted
onto him.

“I’m still not used to the
pressure yet,” Wiltanger said.
“I thought I wrestled O.K. I
wrestled tentative" at first 
The pressure is a lot different
now. I know what Perry went
through last year.” _

Thursday’s win was satisfy-

ing, but the Panthers had no"

time to relax as Saturday they
travelled to the Nebraska
Open and returned home with
six placements. Performing at
that level against stern compe-
tition, the likes of Nebraska,
Oklahoma State, West

Virginia, Wyoming and
Central Oklahoma, was grati-
fying for Stottlemyer.

“I thought this was as fine a
performance as we’ve put
together in a long time,” he
said.

Gibbs claimed the title at
the 167—pound class, Moore
(118), Budman (150) and
Kloiber (190) all took third
place finishes, Wiltanger
(Hwt) finished fifth, while
Fasnacht grabbed seventh
place at 154.

“It was a good tournament
in terms of quality,”
Stottlemyer said. “We won the
matches we were supposed to
and we won a heck of a lot of
matches we weren’t supposed
to.”

He said the weekend indi-
cates the toughness and char-
acter that this team has
already developed and cited
the effort of Kloiber, who suf-
fered a dislocated finger dur-
ing his semi-final match yet
continued on and won it in
overtime. .

“The progress we’ve made
from the beginning of the
year has been phenomenal,
and I think we can’ get a
whole lot better,” Stottlemyer
said. “Wiltanger has improved
so much it’s unbelievable.
That’s not to say we’re not
gonna take our beatings. We
have a hellacious schedule."

Stottlemyer maintained cau-
tious optimism heading into
next weekend, when Pitt
hosts Clemson on Friday and
travels to nationally-ranked
Lock Haven for its Eastern

. Wrestling League opener on

Saturday. Four of seven EWL
teams find themselves ranked
among the nation’s Top 25 at
the moment, and the Panthers
are knocking on the door.

“If our young guys come
through, we’re probably
gonna be in the hunt,”
Stottlemyer said.

the Panther defense managed to hold
its own against the \\"ildcat onslaught.

Bruce said he took pride primarily-

in his teams defense against
\'illano\'a's superstar guard Nikki
Benedix. who needed just l-l points
to reach the coveted l.000—point
plateau. She was held to 12 before
fouling out late in the game.

Though not as effective as in the
first half, the Panther offense held its
own as well. Huemrich led all scorers
in the game with 20 points, and
Ransom finished with 17.

Julie Fornadel was Pitts spark off
the bench, contributing a crucial
seven points down the stretch.

 

Although their second—half scoring
fell short of the \\"ildcats' total. the
Panthers‘ held on and beat Villanova
61-36.

This victory gives Pitt :1 5-0 record
in the Big East as the Panthers look
forward to yet another critical Big
East matchup, this time against
Syracuse at the Carrier Dome.

While Bruce said he is confident
in his team's chances, he knows

that it will be a difficult test for his

team. .
"As with any Big East road game,“

Bruce said. "You can throw all the '

records and statistics out the window.
It will be a really tough game."

Brian Mahoney.

“Lamont has always
been a good offensive
player," Mahoney said.
“He has to always
play against a guy he’s
giving a few inches and a
lot of pounds to  but he
likes the contact of the
Big East style, and he’s
great at getting to the
line.”

Speaking of the foul
line, Middleton and his
teammates sealed their
21st consecutive’ home
win at a place appropri-
ately coined “the charity
stripe."

The Johnnies sank 24 of

Basketball

28 free throws overall (15
of their last 14) to thwart
a last-gasp rally by the
Panthers.

“Pittsburgh’s a pretty
good club,” Mahoney said.
“They're strong inside and
outside and they are going
to win a lot of games.

“This is the biggest win
so far [this seasonl.”

The Panthers’ road to
conference prominence
doesn’t get any easier.
Pitt’s next league tussle is
tomorrow night versus the
17th-ranked Connecticut
’Huskies.

Its next home game is
this Saturday against the

The Panthers never looked
back as they blasted ahead by
as much as '17 points. Some
Friar three—point prayers were
answered as they made the
game close, but Pitt free
throws down the stretch sealed
up the Panther victory, 91-85.

As school began once again

their Panther basketball team

coming off of a victory against
Georgetown. So this was not
the Miami team that Pitt blew
away at the Fitzgerald Field
Houseﬂlast year.

This was Pitt’s first official
day back to school, so most of
the students were on campus
with nothing to do and it
seemed like all of them chose
to go to the hoop game as this
was Pitt’s biggest student
turnout in years. Pitt’s record
probably helped spark the
interest as fans packed the sec-
tions, filled the aisles and even
resorted to sitting on the ﬂoor
along the ‘baselines.

The first half was relatively
close as Pitt didrmanage an
eight—point lead,» but the
Hurricanes whittled that down
to two at the half.

In the second half, Miami
hung tough. Hurricane head

coach Leonard Hamilton was
hit with a technical late in the
second half which helped to
seal Miami’s fate as a loss at
the hands of the Panthers.

The entire game it was
McCullough who resembled a
Hurricane, as he dished and
drove through Miami to spark
the Pitt victory, 85-78.
McCullough almost was a
Hurricane, literally, as Miami
recruited him heavily. But he
decided he did not want to go
to a Big East program that was
not yet established and had no
hopes of competing successful-
ly in the Big East in the near
future, so McCullough chose
Pitt instead.

So the Panthers solidified
their top—25 hopes by improv-
ing to 9-1 overall, and 2-1 in
the Big East as they headed to
Iamaica, New York, to play the

become a constant all season
for the team.

Even without two of their
top divers in senior
co-captain Donna Flatch and
sophomore Anne Marie "Rose,
the ‘divers still took
first in both diving competi-
tions.

First—year diver Sunday
Lewandowski continued

her outstanding efforts by

taking the one—meter and fin-
ishing second in the three-
mete_r.

Pitt sophomore Kara
Sixbury won the three-meter
competition and finished
third in the one—meter.

Head diving coach Julian
Krug said that he was happy
with Lewandowski’s and
Sixbury’s performances.

“They are both very good
divers, very talented. I’m
delighted with them, but at
the same time, we’ve got a
lot of work to do,"
said.

“It was the right kind of
test for right now, and it
turned out well,” Krug said.
“I want to score at NCAAs
this year, and I believe that
we can do it.”

As for the swimmers,
Walczak said that the teams
recent training trip to Puerto
Rico went well.

“We trained really hard in
Puerto Rico, and we just

Krug

gave it our best shot
(Sunday).

“We were together as a
team, and that is very

important,” Walczak said.
“We are still on track for Big
East and for what we want to
do.”

time lead eventually led to
the 14-point victory. in only
15 minutes on the floor Turia
Ransom netted 12 points and

at the center position, scor-
ing 51 points. Providence
guard Sonya Lewis scored 52

The Friars’ downfall proved

to be their shooting. They
threw up 68 shots, hitting
only 20 of them for a pathet-
ic 29 percent. The Panthers
were better, knocking down

Panthers continued their hot
play with a thrilling victory
over the Pirates. improving
to 2-() in the conference, Pitt
overcame poor shooting to
rally in the second half and
defeat The Hall in OT.

Huemrich and Ransom
each netted 18 points in the
Panther win. Dawn Johnson
led Seton Hall with 14.

Pittsburgh: (7-3), Seton
Hall: (7-4)

With three Big East victo-
ries under their belt (includ-
ing a win over Villanova
Saturday) the Panthers are in
great shape in the confer-
ence.

They will play three home
and three away games, all
within the Big East, before
the month is out and are

in an excellent position to '

stay in first place. By the
way, Bullwinkle forms and
ingenious plan to bring
down Badinov, but that’s for
