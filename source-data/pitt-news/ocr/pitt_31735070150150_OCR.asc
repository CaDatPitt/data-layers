Criminal
charges
filed against
two athletes

Cassidy Davis-
Staﬁ“ Writer

Two Pitt athletes face criminal
charges after separate incidents
last weekend. ‘
According to police com-
plaints, Pitt football player Ste-
phen Williams, 19, was charged‘
with simple assault on Saturday.
The next day, Pitt basketball player
Ernest “Trey” Zeigler III, 21, was
charged with driving under the
inﬂuence of alcohol or a cpntrolled
substance. Williams was dismissed
from the football team on Monday,
and Zeigler has been suspended
from the basketball team.
Williams, a redshirt freshman
from'Georgia, was a defensive
back for the Panthers. On Nov.
24 at 5:30 p.m., Pitt police ofﬁcer

q Thomas Lasky ﬁled a report con-

cerning Williams.

According to the complaint,
Williams was charged with-simple
assault, which by deﬁnition states
that “the actor attempted to cause
or intentionally, knowingly or
recklessly caused bodily injury.”

According to the court docu-
ments, the alleged crime was
committed at 206 S. Bouquet St.
in Williams’ Bouquet Gardens
apartment. ‘ P

In the report, Lasky stated that
at 1:40 p.m. on the 24th, hewas
ﬂagged down by a trembling and
distraught woman who claimed to
have been assaulted by Williams.
Lasky said he noticed red marks

Tucker Max draws protesters to second visit tztPz'tt

, .
The last time'Tucker Max was
at Pitt, a senior girl asked him
to pee on her-. '

That visit was part of Max’s
first book tour in 2006, which
included a book-signing stop
at the University. But Monday
night, Max returned _to Pitt to
instead provide students with
the knowledge he has said he ac-
cumulated throughout his col-
lege life and the years after. Max,
'now 36, appeared on stage in the

_ William Pitt Union Ballroom to
share advice he wished he had
been given while in college as
‘a part of Pitt Program Council’s
event, “An Evening with Tucker
Max.” «

Max, author of No. 1 New
York Times Best Seller “I Hope
They Serve Beer in Hell,” is
best known for his creation of
the genre “fratire.” A satirical
take on masculinity consisting
of memoirs written in the form
of short stories, the genre has
also been denduniéed for advo-
cating misogyny. Max received
his .bachelor’s degree in 1998
from the University of Chicago
and his law degree from Duke
Law School in 2001, two key lo-
cations from which the stories
in his booksderive.

His books are replete with‘

stories recounting. drunken
nights, having sex with random
strangers and partying hard. But

early this year, Max revealed that '

he was giving upthe game and
striving to become a more ma-
ture adult. It’s this new role‘ that
Max-presented to Pitt students.

From the moment Max-

emerged on stage, walking to

the vigorous cheers of the stu-
dent crowd, the audience knew
he would deliver a speech unlike
any other.

Max admitted that the di-
rector of Pitt Program Council
asked him not to curse. “That’s
not gonna f*cking last,” he said.

Despite his predominantly
warm reception from audience
members, Max’s PPC—sponsored
appearance on campus was
widely contested in the weeks
leading up to his talk. On Mon-
day evening, protesters waited
outside the Ballroom prior to the
author’s entrance.

Bella Salamone, president of
the Campus Women’s Organi-
zation, said she fo_und it disre-
spectful that Pitt, knowing his
controversial history, invited
him and paid him to speak to
students. She added that she
received dozens of emails from
students prior to the event ex-
pressing concern.

“It’s our job to represent these
voices,” she said, referring to the
group of about 30 students who
joined her outside of the Ball-
room for a “Things funnier than
Tucker Max” event. The group,
which included both men and
women, held up signs and hand-
ed out pamplets explaining why
Max shouldn’t have come to Pitt..

Following brief details about .
— his first visit to Pitt, Max pro-

ceeded to delve into the topic
at hand.

“It’s something about ﬁnding
your passion,” he said.

Max said that he wrote his h

speech on the plane to Pitts-
burgh. He crafted the speech in
order to provide students with
advice he wished he had when
he was in college. _

“I thought I was the big
swinging d*ck,” he said. “But

H The Student Government Board Al-

locations Committee‘has extended
its application deadline to Thursday,
Nov. 29, at 5 p.m.

Applications for committee mem-
ber positions were previously due
Tuesday, Nov. 20, but the deadline’
was extended because of a delay in
interviews for the Allocations ‘chair
position.

The Allocations Committee is
responsible for aiding SGB in dis-
tributing the more than $2 million
Student Activities Fund to certiﬁed
student groups around campus. Com-
mittee members serve a term that

spans from the first day of the spring‘

semester to the ﬁnal day of the fall
semester. ‘ -

Allocations Committee Chairman
Michael Nites said he has reviewed 40
or so submitted applications and is
lookingforvvard to holdinginterviews
to fill thef12 spots on the committee.

“There are a lot of different types
of applicants and many good appli-
cants, so it should be interesting to

‘ match faces to names on paper,” said

Nites, who will ﬁnish his term this
fall before starting as an SGB mem-
ber in the spring. “D elaying the chair
interviews gives more people time to
apply, and the longer that it is open,
the better.”

The application, which is acces-

I was utterly unprepared.”

Max asked the audience if it felt as
unprepared as hedid, and the majority of
the audience members raised their hands.

“Do any of you know how to negotiate
a rent? How many of you have more than
$100 in your checking account?” he asked.

Max said that the students arenot to
blame, but rather parents and schools are
at fault for not teaching students what
they need to function in the real world.

Had Max been speaking to a high
school audience, he said that he would
advise them not to attendcollege.

“This educational institution is built

to perpetuate its existence. It’s not built _

to serve you. You’re just a tuition-paying
unit. You are not the point of this institu-

. tion,” he said.

Max then outlined three things that
would prepare students for the world.

His first piece of advice was to “drink
and f*ck.” The second piece of advice Max
offered students was to ask questions.

“Everything you’ve been told is
bul1sh*t. They’re all liars, because all the

rules are made to help the powerful, not '

the individual,” he said.
His third recommendation followed

said she was hyperventilating while initially
recounting an incident she claimed had
taken place in Williams’ apartment.

Lasky then went to Williams’ apartment,
where he questioned Williams. According
to the court documents, Williams said he
asked the woman to leave so he could order
dinner, and she became upset. Later on,
Williams said that the woman was upset
because he refused to have sex with her.

At this point, the woman said that during
the incident, one of her earrings had been
ripped out, and Lasky noticed blood on her
right ear lobe. ‘

Williams was then handcuffed and taken
into custody.

On Monday, Pitt football head coach
Paul Chryst announced that Williams was
dismissed from the team for disciplinary
reasons. .

additional comment.

In a separate incident, Zeigler, a junior
who transferred from Central Michigan
University in the offseason, was charged
with a DUI-on Nov. 25 at 53:35 a.m.

Jeremy Skaggs, a Pittsburgh police of-
ﬁcer, was dispatched to Craft Avenue and
Boulevard of the Allies at 3:11 a.m. because
a man was reported to have passed out in
his vehicle at the intersection.

Medics arrived, awoke Zeigler and had
him examined by paramedics. '

According to the police report, Dave
Hyatt, a cab driver in Pittsburgh, said that
earlier that night he had seen a man sitting
in a red Hummer, seemingly asleep, while
Hyatt was transporting a group of people
to its destination. On his way back, Hyatt
saw that the same man — who turned out
to be Zeigler —— was still asleep, and Hyatt
called the police.

After performing a battery of ﬁeld sobri-
ety tests, Skaggs said in his report on the
incident, the officer administered a por-
table breath test, which tested positive for
the presence of alcohol. Breathalyzer tests
later in the evening indicated that Zeigler’s
blood alcohol content reached .129 percent.

Max explained that he became a writer
because he submerged himself in writing,

According to the Pennsylvania Department
of Transportation’s website, the legal limit
in the state is .08 percent.

After police contacted his parents, Zei-
gler wasreleased from custody at 5:05 a.m.

Pitt head basketball coach Jamie Dixon
said he was surprised by Zeigler’s arrest,
and that he understands the ‘consequences
he faces, according to a press release from
the athletics department.

' “The incident involving Trey Zeigler is
not only surprising, but incredibly disap-
pointing,” Dixon said. “Although I believe
it was out of character for Trey, he has been
immediately suspended until further no-
tice.” -

After news of his impending summons
arrest was released, Zeigler issued a state-
ment of apology. ‘ . '

“I want to apologize to my family, th
University of Pittsburgh, my teammates
and coaches and the entire Pittsburgh com-
munity,” Zeigler said. “This is not indicative
of the kind of person I am, not the kind of
person I want to be.” I

thus making himself into who he became.

“I started writing because all I wanted
to do was write emails to my friends and
make them laugh,” he said.

Max ended his speech admitting that
he made countless mistakes and that he

‘ has no true answers. He said that the only
thing he can tell his audience is how he
came to be.

“I’m worth a lot of money. I can do
anything I want. I’m a star — whatever.»
That’s the cool thing about having the
courage to take risks, always asking why
and deciding to make yourself into what
you want to become,” he said. “It doesn’t
necessarily mean you’ll be me, but you’ll

I have a life that works.”

The night thenopened to a question-
and—answer period.

One question prompted Max to speak
about the changes‘ in his lifestyle. He ex-
plained that life at 36 is different than it
was when he was 20. '

“Sh*t changes. At 30, you’ll be more
aboutﬁnding the right girl, not about as
many as you can,” he said.

A student asked what Max plans on do-
ing in his future,‘ now that he has retired
from writing fratire. Max responded that
he has plans to co-write a biography with
a movie star and continue investing.

“I ,don’t have any more stories to
write,” he added.  '

V Rohith Palli
Colummst

In grade school, we were told we
live in a representative democ-
racy. Examining the state of our
political system during the past
few months and listening to my
fellow students’ gripes with the
system, I asked myself: “Does
our government actually repre-
sent the people as a whole?”
There are several under-
standable failings in an admit-
tedly imperfect system —— for
example, the nonrepresentation
in the House of Representatives.
House members are meant to be
most directly responsible and
responsive to the public, being
re—e1ected every two years. Yet
the makeup of the House of Rep-

resentatives didnot change with

the electorate this election cycle.

V While the Democrats won
more than 50 percent of the pop-
ular vote, the Republicans have
almost 54 percent of the seats
in the House. This phenomenon

Gerrymandering needs to changeto make

percent of the vote but only 51 ‘

percent of the power.
There are many probable par-
tial causes for this effect, but

£1":/v V... — __.  L.

.” I asked
myself:
“Does our
government
actually
represent
people as a
whole?”

one comes to mind as easiest to
identify: gerrymandering. This
is best demonstrated at a state-
by-state level. Within California,

  

the Democrats received about

60.6 percent of thevotes cast

in House elections, but came

6 away with 38 of 53 seats (71.7

percent). On the flip side, in
Texas, Republicans won 57.4

percent of votes cast in House

elections but control 24 of 36

' ‘seats (66.7 percent).

Clearly, both parties beneﬁt

‘ greatly from gerrymandering in

different states, which creates
geographic and systemic bar-

riers to proper representation.

One disturbing aspect of this
is that state legislatures, often
elected every two years (as is the
case in the House), areable to
extend their reach eight more
years into the future via redis-
tricting in years following U.S.
Censuses. These representatives
are meant to constitute a snap-
shot in the evolution of society
and ideas. It is unconscionable
that this snapshot, by luck of the
year, is able to exert an undue
influence on the future of the

country (and each state).
'9 Changing the practice of gerryman-
dering is critical to ensuring that every
vote counts and every vote countsequally
every year. In order to ensure fairness,
redrawing of district lines must be taken
out of the hands of state legislatures.

' One option would be to -send the job

to the judiciary or to create “bipartisan” '

commissions, but these steps are likely to
be quite futile: The problem would simply
be pushed one step away from electoral
accountability.

A better option would be to write a
computer program to do it. The usual
problems would arise. Who gets to decide
the algorithm? How much do we trust the
computer program?

But there are deﬁnite upsides. The
lasting effect of_census—year legislatures
would b,e‘ﬁelirni7fi’ate,d. In addition, it is
likely that Idistrlcts will be set up in such
a way that the people will be ‘better rep-
resented. ,

The harder question, though, is what
would be the goal ofa computer program

a majority of minority voters? Maximize ’

geographic cohesiveness of-each district?

I propose that the goal should be to
create maximally cohesive contiguous
districts with equal numbers of voters.

In other words, thejprogram should put

people in the same neighborhood — and ,
possibly in the same city —— in the same’

that there are an equal number of vot-

a speciﬁc set ofvoters. ,
Though the ideal solution would be

" to ﬁx redistricting as outlined above,

Democrats like to hold California an_d
Republicans like to hold, Texas, so "such re-

form is highly unlikely. In the absence of
total reform, the oft-raised issue of party
identification could help mitigate the
deleterious effects of gerrymandering.

Currently, many people go to the bal-
lot and cast “straight Republican” or
“straight Democrat” votes. This ability,
and even the, identification on the ballot,
defeats the purpose of having local elec—.
tions. The purpose is for representatives
to be in touch with voters and accurately
reﬂect their concerns. I don’t_oppose
party afﬁliation, but at the polls, voters
should be choosing between candidates,
not parties. This applies even if they agree
completely with a particular party.

For this reason, one way to ‘attempt
to create more equal representatioh is to
eliminate party afﬁliationlfrom ballots.
This would in no way solve the problem;
people can stand 10 feet away handing
out flyers identifying the candidates from
each party, but it will give a symbolic shift
in the way that voting happens; Laudably,
several states already operate under this
policy, either not allowing straight party
voting or disallowing party identiﬁcation
altogether. This policy should be adopted
by all states. l . V

Takenindividually, or together, these
changes can help to reduce the level of
misrepresentation within our govern-
ment. _[ A -

To the Editor,

After I graduated, I picked up on the
disquiet growing among some Pitt stu-
dents with regards to the University Hon-
ors College. Having beneﬁted from UHC
activities myself, I became concerned
after reading the coverage in The Pitt
News on this issue.

’ First, I think the Pitt undergraduate

— community should maintain perspective.

After the passing of Dean Alec Stewart, a
replacement was needed. Naturally, un-
der Dean Edward Stricker, the UHC today

LETTER To THE EDITOR

That is simply the nature of leadership
and organization.

Second, I do not belieVe”there is as
much of a philosophical “divide” between

.the old and the new, as some students

might make it'out to seem. Sure, “intellec—
tual curiosity” is a warm sentiment that
is importantto any student. However, I
believe it’s reductive to separate it from
“academic achievement,” what is being
presented as the antithesis. To achieve
something, you must ﬁrst be curious. I
guarantee you that even pre—health stu-
dents ask “why?”

curiosity,” the UHC could be more inviting
to people of all academic backgrounds,
including the applied disciplines. For
example, it is less likely that anursing
student will pontiﬁcate on the existence
of God, but more likely he or she has
thoughts on how to improve health care
delivery. The aim of the UHC should be
to accommodate all scholarship, and by
removing a restrictive maxim, students
traditionally outside the liberal arts circle
would feel more welcome.

I think the com'ments added by Dr.
Lewis Jacobson are important to recall.

After Dean Stewart’s tragic passing, there '

was talk among students to rename the

UHC after him. However, as thoseclose _

to Stewart have shared, he wouldn’t have
wanted his ideologies to echo through
eternity. _

I wish you all luck in resolving this ‘

issue. Rernemberthe'tradition of com-
munity and excellence Pitt has always
been known for. '

“Empowering Women: Artisan Coop-
eratives that Transform Communities"
Carnegie Museum of Natural History
Through May 12

Admission: free with a Pitt ID

In Cuzco, Peru, a group of women
worked for months to create a hand-
woven quilt from sheep wool to keep an
old tradition alive. In Morocco, another
group of women used a Turk’s head knot
to make buttons into jewelry. And in
eight other countries across Africa, Asia
and South America, women formed co-
operatives to create artisan goods that
beneﬁt their countries’ economies.

“Empowering Women: Artisan Coop-
eratives that Transform Communities”
is an exhibition that demonstrates the
powerful effectsof 10 cooperatives, all
run by women, in 10 different countries.
As women in many countries strive to
play a more prominent role in society,
cooperatives run bywomen around the
world work to improve ﬁnancial condi-
tions for those without much opportu-
nity -- and they’re doing it artistically.
The exhibit, originally presented at the
Museum of International Folk Art in
Santa Fe, N.M., runs through May 12 at
the Carnegie Museum of Natural History
on Forbes Avenue.

‘Anupama Jain, the community pro-
grams coordinator for the Carnegie Mu-
seum of Natural History, explained that
the exhibition shows the variation" and
marked differences in traditions among
the countries.

“The way that they function varies
based on how people live in that place.

Women-based cooperatives help fuel societies,
improve qu ty of lifem C0mmllllllleS    

So what I think is really interesting,

rather than people [working] in some

unfamiliar way, like going to a factory
to work, they have made these centers
based on where the women live, anyway.

They work cooperatively, but they’re not ,

going to the city to sell their things. It’s
a littlebit more organic to their lives,”
Jain said. ‘ ‘

The exhibit is small and takes up only
a single room at the museum. But the
products from the 10 cooperatives cover
a broad expanse of geography, show-
ing off goodsgfrom African, Asian and
South American regions. The exhibit
features groups of women who have cre-
ated cooperatives in India, Nepal, Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, Bolivia,
Peru, South Africa, Morocco, Rwanda,

A Kenya and Swaziland._The original ex-

hibit, presented in Santa Fe, was curated
by anthropologist Suzanne Seriif.

The Carnegie museum’s represen-
tation of the exhibit includes “talking
circles,” in which groups discuss themes
that exist in the exhibition, such as gen-
der rights, market risks and other labor
issues. There are also video components
attached to each cooperative to accom-
pany the artwork.

Cooperatives, both in the United
States and abroad, tend to go against

the grain of what Jain calls “business "

as usual,” making it diﬂicult to compete
against companies that create similar,
less expensive products —- a phenom-
enon that will never cease to exist in a
global economy with a competitive
marketplace.

Erin Kaplan, a visiting lecturer in
the University’s economics department,
explained that a cooperative is “a group
of people who work togetherin order to

“If you’re just one person making
something, it’s very difficult to access
international markets. You don’t have
the ability to ship abroad or access ﬁ-
nances. When people work in a group,
they’re able to access markets overseas,”
she said. '

More people working toward a simi-
lar goal create more opportunity for
the cooperative, and in the cases of the
featured cooperatives, speciﬁcally cre-
ate more opportunity to interact with
international markets. ‘ ‘

The cooperatives aren’t solely,»
concerned with proﬁtabil-
ity, but it is a driving

Within the past decade, we have
witnessed an incredible evolution
in video gaming. Graphics reached
an unimaginable point only ﬁve
years ago, dynamic lighting and
physics are now the norm in ev-
ery game rather than a novelty and
artiﬁcial intelligence has become
more complex than previously
thought possible. The technology
has ﬁnally caught up to the ingenu-
ity of video-game developers.

But one gaming franchise con-
tinues to hold the gaming commu-
nity back. Its lack of creativity and

technological advancement its 

inept attempts Aattinnovaﬁonghave

done more harm tha‘lnilg:ood to‘_§§m—

“Call of Duty.” -

First released in October 2003,
the original “Call of Duty” was an
innovative ﬁrst-person shooter

set in World War II. Its immediate v

competition, the “Medal of Honor”
series, was the dominant shooter
game for ﬁve years prior to the
release of “Call of Duty.” But the
inaugural installment of the “Call
of Duty” series changed the way
gamers and developers thought
about ﬁrst-person shooting. Using
a dynamic AI squad system, “Call of
Duty” was the ﬁrst shooter to make
gamers feel like part of a team —— a

global signiﬁcance they have today, and
with years of practice, they began to cre-
ate the products that they create for the
marketplace.
. “These artworks are just beautiful.
They’re really, really gorgeous. They re-
quire a lot of expertise, years and years of
training. ~And~then these are success stories.
These are women who have really battled
some really challenging things,” she said.

The women use various materials to
produce their goods. One cooperative even
uses telephone wire, a human—produced
material, to create baskets.

“I would say that all of these people are ,

incredibly resourceful and sort of creat-

ing beauty even out of terrible things, and .

working together,” Jain said.

“Making art can be rewarding for the
individual. To some extent, people all over
the world create art to express themselves.
It just depends on what the goal of the co-
operative is,” Kaplan said. The other — and
possibly more important -— motivation is

' ﬁnancial in nature.

Despite the impressive achievements
these women have made in their respective
cooperatives, viewers are urged to consider

November 27, 2012 I ThePitt News I vvvwv,pittnevvs.com

the difficulties the women encounter. Jain
believes the exhibition is a “wonderful cel-
ebration,” but people still need to think
about the “global marketplace and what
does it mean to be in a cooperative in a
global capitalist economy,” she said.

Kaplan believes cooperatives assist their
respective societies and give economic op-
portunities to women who are likely to be
uneducated.

“The beneﬁt of these cooperatives, giv-
ing women the chance to be productive
and sell goods inthe larger marketplace, is
inevitably going to begood for the commu-

nity,” Kaplan said. “Giving [women] formal,

education gives them more opportunities.
These cooperatives give women who are not
educated and can’t participate in the formal
marketplace a chance to participate.” ‘
Kaplan also explained that more active
female participation in society creates a
better futgure for their children. 1 V

“Whe "women*are more involved in the

‘ economy? :when"they’re more educated,
children have better outcomes. women.

tend to advocate children’seducation and
health,” she said.

Jain stressed the impact this exhibition
has on the community.

“We’re talking about globalization. We’re
talking about culture and.homogenization
and inequality in the world and violence in
the world. This is a place wherepeople can
come and have productive conversation.”

Furthermore, “Call of Duty” created an
incredible atmosphere. Recreating classic
cinematic moments from ﬁlms such as “En—
emy at the Gates” and “Saving Private Ryan”
and the HBO miniseries “Band of Brothers,”
the initial “Call of Duty” game made the play-
er feel like part of a much more epic conﬂict
than just what was unfolding in the game. -

With the 2007 release of “Call of Duty
4: Modern Warfare,” franchise’s develop-
ment company Inﬁnity Ward and publisher
Activision started down a disastrous ﬁve-
year road. The initial release of “Modern

Warfare”-received positive reviews, and to
date, “Call of Duty 4” has sold more than
13 million copies. The modern setting} was
an antidote to the repetitive, largely WWII-
based ﬁrst—person shooting genre. Also, the
game’s multiplayer mode capitalized on the
successful model the original “Call of Duty”
introduced, and the developers were able to
mold it into an optimal product, which has
deﬁned online ﬁrst—person shooting games
since 2007.

Here lies the problem. While “Modern
Warfare” was a fantastic entry into the “Call
of Duty” series, Activision released it ﬁve
years ago. Now, when playing “Modern War-
fare 3” of the more recently released “Black
Ops II,” i ’s clear that “Call of Duty” has not
grown much since 2007. Graphically, the

game has not improved signiﬁcantly since
“Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2” (which
Activision released in 2009), and, despite-
minor improvements, the graphical engine
has begun to show its age, especially when
compared to games that run on the modern
Frostbite 2 game engine, including “Battle-
ﬁeld 3.” Similarly, the multiplayer remains
largely unchanged from that seen in “Mod—
ern Warfare 2,” following the same basic
formula pioneered in the original “Call of
Duty,” a nearly decade-old game.

Video gaming, like any digital industry,
relies on innovation. But'the commercial
success of “Call of Duty”_has permitted its
developers to succumb to lazy game design

~ and an oversimpliﬁcation of what made the

original “Call of Duty” great: epic, cinematic

battles involving squad cooperation. “Mod—
ern Warfare 3” and “Black Ops II,” the two
most recent releases in the franchise, rely
on cliche storylines and over-the—top action,
neither of which are in line with the sort of
realistic grit that the original “Call of Duty”
prided itself on. —

_While rehashing a proven formula may
make business sense for Activision and “Call
Of Duty” developers, it deprives the industry
of innovation. Unfortunately, gamers will
keep buying “Call of Duty” games. But it’s
becoming increasingly obvious that gamers
are waiting for the next franchise to take a
creative stance similar to that of the ﬁrst
“Call of Duty” — an intensely innovative,
revisionist game that could again chang
the industry. I Z » ,' '

The Pitt women’s basketball
team has more than put its dis-
appointing season—opening loss
to Youngstown State behind it.

With two more victories — one
a nailbiter, the other a blowout
—- in the past few days, the Pan-
thers (5-1) stretched their winning
streak to ﬁve games, meaning that
head coach Agnus Berenato needs
just one more victory to tie the
school’s wins record and two to
break it.

Pitt 58, Brown 57

Abby Dowd drained only three
of her 11 ﬁeld’-goal attempts for
the Pitt women’s basketball team
against Brown on Saturday after-
noon at the Petersen Events Cen-
ter. But the timing of the redshirt
junior guard’s ﬁnal basket was
perfect. I T .

Dowd hit a 3—pointer with
less than 10 seconds remaining,
propelling the Panthers (4-1) to a
58-57 triumph in their ﬁrst—ever
matchup against non-conference
opponent Brown (2-3).

On a poor shooting day for

V the Panthers’ 3-point specialist,

Dowd’s season-high nine points
did not come easily, but she said
it is her job to continue shooting
and hopefully catch a rhythm.

“I wasn’t shooting well in the
second half,” she said. “It’s pretty

frustrating as a shooter, because

that’s my role on the team. I’m
much better if I don’t have to
think. That was a practice shot
and we do that every day.”

column, they endured offensive
struggles against a tough Brown
defense. Dowd’s 27 percent shoot-
ing.success was representative of
the entire Pitt offense, which shot
just 28.4 percent from the ﬂoor.
Berenato recognized the lack-
luster offensive output, but,cred-
ited redshirt junior guard Ashlee

when you do that, you become
tentative. You can’t play tenta-
tively. Ashlee Anderson really got
us going in the second half. She
did not play tentatively.”
Anderson, who ﬁnished with

"a season-high 16 points, scored

six straight points for the Pan-
thers, forcing Brown head coach
Jean Marie Burr to call a timeout
to break Pitt’s momentum in the
second half.

Following the timeout, An- 4 7

freshman guardjordin Alexander
and ﬁnished the play with a layup.
The turnover-induced basket hap-
pened with less than nine minutes
remaining in the game and put
Anderson’s scoring streak up to
eight unanswered points. More
importantly, the layup gave the
Panthers their ﬁrst lead in the
contest.

Anderson felt like the onus was

on her to lead Pitt’s second—ha1f.-5

comeback.

“Somebody has to step up in_
the moment, and I felt like it was
my time,” she said. “I talked with

‘my coaches, and they said that

A GRAIN OF SAUL

Bold predictions for the

remainder of the NFL season

Isaac Saul
Senior Stayj’ Writer

The National Football League’s outlook took
some interesting turns over the last couple

C ' weeks, but don’t expect the surprises to stop

coming.

With the regular season’s ﬁnal few weeks
ahead of us, here are ﬁve things I bet you
don’t think will happen that I’m predicting
just might:

. Neither the San Francisco 49ers nor
the Chicago Bears will win a playoff game.

I know what you’re thinking: How could
I bet against the second— and th;ffd—best re-
cords in the NFCand two of the  defenses
in the NFL? Well, I’ll tell you.  ’  4

First, the 49ers are setting themselves
up for disaster by doing this quarterback

dance —— one that has been endorsed by their ‘

head coach. There are only ﬁve games left
in the season, and you expect me to bet on

a team who doesn’t know who its starting .
quarterback is? Sorry, but I just can’t do that.

Add to this the fact that San Francisco
just lost both running back Frank Gore and
wide receiver Kyle Williams to injury — on
thesame play, nonetheless — and my con-
ﬁdence in San Francisco is shaking with
every snap. ,

On the Chicago side of things, I’m just
playing the bracket. Even if the Bears win
the NFC North, chances are they’ll miss the
ﬁrst-round bye because the Atlanta Falcons

and 49ers have a lead in the standings. That .

could mean a wild-card matchup with either
the Packers or the winner of the NFC East
—— which we’ll get to in a minute,

If Chicago draws the Washington Red'-
skins, it’s in luck and should get an easy win.
But if the Bears see the New YorkGiants
or Green Bay Packers, their season looks
over to me.

The Pittsburgh Steelers will miss the
playoffs .

A few weeks ago, the Steelers looked
primed for another playoff run. But after
losing quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, put-
ting up a dismaleight turnovers against the
Browns and watching the AFC North slip into
the stranglehold of the Baltimore Ravens,
Pittsburgh could be watching its season start

to crumble.

. Meanwhile, the Indianapolis Colts, Cin-
cinnati Bengals and Miami Dolphins are all
coming off wins that propelled them into
the wild-card race. These four teams are
ﬁghting over two playoff spots, and it’s going
to come down to the wire — but I see the
Steelers being left out.

The Colts are playing for their leukemia-
stricken coach, and the Bengals feel it’s ﬁ-
nally their time to be a consistent contender
— it helps having a freak talent like wide
receiver A.j. Green.

The NFL will never make a worthwhile
suspension again

First,_we watched the New Orleans Saints
get torn to piece's,‘reprimanding players who
might not even be guilty of putting bounties
on other players. Then we saw their suspen-
sions lifted, only‘to be reinstated.

Then, Ravens safety Ed Reed got sus-
pended, appealed and won.

Now, two, of the Seahawks’ starting cor-
nerbacks are going down four games for
Adderall use in the-midst of their playoff run
and Detroit Lions defender Ndamukong Suh

- is being “evaluated” for what appeared to me

like themmjostincidental contact I’ve ever seen

 game. Suh literally kicked Texans
V  Matt Schaub in the groin as he
 was’bein‘g'rolled, ﬂipped and blinded on his

  

way to the ground.

Unfortunately, reputation is everything
to league commissioner Roger Goodell —— it
seems objective evaluation has gone out the
window ——_ and that could land Suh on the
bench by the end of the week. On my end,
Goodall is not inciting any kind of conﬁ-
dence that he will start spending his time
on worthwhile things.

The “NFC Least” will end with a tough
ﬁght between the Redskins and the Giants

Man, this division is horrendous. I mean

- really, the Giants picked up a big win against

the Packers on Sunday night, but they’ve also
been blown out by the Cincinnati Bengals.
Unfortunately for the G—Men, the rest of
their schedule includes'Atlanta, Baltimore,
New Orleans, Philadelphiaand, of course,
the Redskins. I
If the ’Skins can pulloff a victory on their
home ﬁeld against New York next week, it’ll
be a dead heat to the ﬁnish line. Instead of
Atlanta and New Orleans, the Redskins face
Dallas and Cleveland —— a trade I think any
team in the NFL would take right about now.
It ends this week if the Giants can pull off
a victory in D.C., but if they don’t 
The NFL’s best rookie quarterback is
going to get torched in the playoffs
Frankly, I’m not sure who the best rookie
quarterback in the league is. Iwant to say
Washington’s Robert Grifﬁn III, but I’m no
fool. In my eyes, whoever takes over down
the stretch and leads their team to the play-
offs is the man.‘ I
Andrew Luck has a head start, but the
Colts look to me like a team ripe to collapse.
Regardless, if the Colts make it, they are
going to get stomped by whoever they draw
in a strong AFC ﬁeld (anyone catch that Pa‘-
triots game?). ‘ - ~
On the NFC side, the Redskins have
proved their defense is a joke week—in and
week- out, so don’t expect much out of them if
they have to face any one of the high—scoring
NFC teams, such as the Packers", Bears, Saints
or 49ers. I

On Senior Day, Ray Graham played his ﬁnal home
football game-for Pitt, leading the Panthers to a
27-6 victory over No. 18 Rutgers at Heinz Field. With
his 123 yards on 23 carries, the senior running back
moved into third place on the Pitt all-time rush-
ing list behind only Tony Dorsett and Curvin Richards.

Abby Dowd, a redshirt junior guard on the women's
basketball team, ﬁnished with a season-highnine
points in Pitt's 58-57 victory over Brown, but her clutch
3-pointer with less than 10 seconds remaining made the
difference in the come—from-behind triumph. Dowd is
averaging 3.3 points per game for the 5-1 Panthers.

the free-throw line. Golden picked up those
necessary points, as star junior guard Asia
Logan was held to less than 10 points for
the ﬁrst time this season. Though Logan’s
offense was stymied, she collected a team-
high 10 rebounds, eight of which were of-
fensive boards.

Despite the offensive struggles, Coach
Berenato credited Pitt’s defense and re-
bounding late in the game for sparking
the Panthers’ come-from-behind victory.

Dowd’s game-winning shot occurred
after a half—court trap that resulted in An-
derson’s fourth steal of the game and, after

a missed shot, Logan grabbed Pitt’s 26th
offensive rebound on the day. _

“A win is a win and you take it and run
with it,” Berenato said. “This was without a
doubt the best game Brown has played. We
held them to 57 points, and any time you
can hold a team under 60, you should win.”

Pitt 86, Longwood 60

Nothing was ordinary about the ﬁrst
half of the Pitt women’s basketball team’s
victory over Longwood Monday night at
the Petersen Events Center.

’ The game began with an.administra—
tive technical foul on the Lancers for an
incorrect jersey number, resulting in two
converted free throws for guard Brianna

Kiesel and a 2-0 lead for the Panthers be-
fore the opening tip.

After the tipoff, Pitt "was able to open up
a 15-6 lead within the ﬁrst seven minutes
of play in a performance that appeared to

‘be destined for a routine double-digit vic-

tory for Pitt. But shortly after, Longwood
(1-5) stormed back with a 13-0 run to take
a three—point lead over the heavily favored
Panthers.

After the Panthers brought the Lancers’

. scoring run to a halt, a Loliya Briggs offen-

sive rebound and put—back bucket sparked
the Panthers. That would prove to be the
beginning of Va Pitt 9-0 run over the ﬁnal
three minutes of the ﬁrst half, helping the

Panthers lead 35-30 at halftime. ‘I

The second half provedto go as planned
for the Panthers, as they stretched their
winning streak to ﬁve games with an 86-
60 victory. ..

_ Kiesel, the star of the second half and
the game for the Panthers, scored a career-
high 27 points to help Berenato move closer
to the school’s all—time wins mark.

Berenato was pleased with her sopho-
more guard’s performance.

“I thought our coach on the court was

i back,” Berenatdsaid of Kiesel. “She went

through a time when she was struggling a
little bit on the court, but today she was
back with her game and her leadership.”

Golden recorded the ﬁrst double—dou-
ble of her career, ﬁnishing the game with
12 points and 10 rebounds, while junior
guard Marquel Davis’ 10 points off the
bench sparked the offensive outburst in
the second half.

In a sloppy game in which four ﬂagrant
fouls were called, the Panthers proved too

much to handle for the Lancers, whose

planned seven—hour bus trip from Virginia
turned into a 10-hour trek Monday night.

Logan, who recorded her second dou-
bleldouble of the season, said the Panthers
are playing well right now.

“We are really focused right now on each
and every game,” the junior said. “We’re
focused on what ‘each team does and getting
the job done against them.”

The Panthers will play their ﬁrst road

game of the season against Lafayette on T

Saturday,vDec. 1, at 2 p.m. and a win will
tie’Berenato for the school record in- coach-
ing wins. , V

Kiesel and the rest of the/Panthers are
looking forward to facing the Leopards
on the road.

“Playing at home gives us that extra
boost, knowing weare protecting our home
court and we need to protect it,” Kiesel said.
“But I’m excited for every home and road
game — just another chance for us to get
out there and get a win.” I
