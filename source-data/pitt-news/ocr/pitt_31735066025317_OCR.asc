Speaker cites societal bontophobia

By Heather York
Staff Writer

James Huggins always knew
he was different, but he convinced
himself that his attraction to men
was a phase. He joined a fraternity
in college and married his high-
school sweetheart. But at one
point he realized his phase would
not end.

He went to a bar supposedly
frequented by gay men and
lesbians and drank until he was
brave enough to follow a man
who looked gay into the
bathroom. When he got there, he
said, “I want to go home with
you.” »

But that’s not how it should be,
Huggins said. He shouldn’t have
been. scared to admit his

homosexuality; he shouldn’t have
pretended to be someone he
wasn’t; and he never should have
followed a total stranger into a
bathroom and invited himself
home with him, he said.
Huggins, who at 44 lives with
the man he has shared a
relationship with for 21 years,

frankly discussed gay men,

lesbians and homophobia with
students last night at the William
Pitt Union.

“I was so naive,” he said. “It
shouldn’t be that way now.”

As a gay man and as associate ,

director of Persad, a professional

. agency offering therapy for gay

men, lesbians and bisexuals,
Huggins has experienced
homophobia. '

“We think of ourselves as a

liberal country, above
stereotyping,” Huggins said. “But
in reality this is a racist,

homophobic, macho country‘

very uncomfortable with sexual
issues.” .
Heterosexism would be a better
word for homophobia, Huggins
said, because “it’s not a phobia,
being scared of something. It’s
treating a class of people
differently, like anti-semitism.”
“Many people ask, ‘How do
you i become homosexual?”
Huggins said “It's also good to
ask, ‘How do people turn out to

be heterosexual?’ And the answer ' C  ,
to both questions is that we don't I ’

know.”

Legal issue
Will prevent
IFC escorts

By Heather Gahres
sraﬁ Writer

Due to legal liability, the Greek
escort service that was proposed
Monday evening to the
Panhellenic Association will not
be implemented this semester.

Implementing the Greek
Guardian system could put the
entire Greek system at a risk of
being sued if anything happened
to persons being escorted home,
said Student Government Board
member Derrick St. Clair.

' St. Clair discussed the legal
ramifications of the program with
Jeremy Weiss and Douglas Siegel,
who proposed the plan.

“From an adrninistrative
viewpoint, if this thing is going‘ to
work, we want it to work right.
We have to make sure that every

Personal safety guide being developed @2563 Committee  

By Christine Hanna

‘News Assistant

A» Stay Safe Guide that will include
emergency and referral numbers, statistics
of crime spots on campus, maps and tips
on personal safety is underway’ by the
Student Government Board Public Safety
Committee.

' The committee announced its plans for
the guide at last night’s open public-safety

meeting. The committee members saide

they are hoping to get the guide done by
the end of the semester so it can be printed
over the summer.

Public Safety Director William Brennan
said he would like to see additional areas
touched on in the safety guide, including
sections on thefts with statistics and tips

_ telling what to do in the case of prank calls’

and lost credit cards. Brennan also

cautioned students about using their Mac
cards_ at outdoor banking centers late at
night and drinking alcohol if they do not
know its source. .

The committee also addressed the idea
of a protest against rape, “Take Back_ the
Night,” which is‘ scheduled for April 9 at
8:30 p.m. Students will meet in Schenley
Quadrangle to let the city know that
crimes of rape and date rape will not be
tolerated. The march will be sponsored by
both the SGB and the Campus Women’s
Organization. Public Safety will be
providing a police escort and traffic control.

“The March is a fabulous idea. It is a
great idea for students to gather together.
It will make students aware that this
campus will never be 100-percent safe,"

said SGB member and interim chair of the"

SGB Public Safety Committee, Derrick St.
Clair.

I

“Hopefully there will be a lot of
participation,” St. Clair said. _

Another plan for educating students
about rape will be implemented nextfall.
In the program, FEAR, Friends Educating
Against Rape, students will teach other
peers about rape.

Five sorority women and five fraternity
men will go through training at university’
and city rape-counseling centers so they
will be able to educate others, St. Clair
said. ,

“Everybody has heard of date rape, [but]
nobody reports it because no one knows
what it is,” St. Clair said. .

Many students would be surprised at
the definition of date rape, St. Clair said. It
needs to be put into the heads of fraternity
guys when they're sober because their
judgement can be clouded when
intoxicated, he said. -

In other matters, St. Clair said that the’

“ SGB will be checking all major emergency
phones around campus to insure that they
work. He said it will also take immediate
action in places that have lighting that
does not work. ' . ‘

Other issues that came up at the meeting
were the abuse of shuttles and police
service for the new hill-side dorm.

St. Clair said he has heard complaints

that the shuttle has been used to take a -
student to the gas station to buy cigarettes I

and to take students as far as Station
Square and Squirrel Hill. Brennan said that
he instructed the drivers to use discretion
of the outside boundary because of the
.PAT,strike. ,
“We have to wait until the budget is

reviewed," Brennan said. The 2.7-percent”

reduction in Public Safety's budget is

For The Pitt News

General Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
visited Pittsburgh Tuesday to speak about the importance of
staying in school. He was greeted by thousands of educators
from around the country assembled for the National Dropout
Conference.

At a luncheon held at the David Lawrence Convention Center,
Powell was the final speaker of the three-day event. He said that
the world belongs to the well trained and well educated
because “the technological era challenges us.

“The key to this new era is training and education,” Powell
said. “The lock to which that key fits is our youth.”

Powell said American businesses spent about $30 billion last
_ year to bring Americans up to literacy standards. He said it’s time
to take better care of our youth. 9

Powell told the educators he appreciates and applauds them
for the challenge they face. “Remember that you have the most
important job in the world.”

He also said young Americans can do anything with the right
tools. _

Ninety—seven percent of armed forces personnel have high
school diplomas. Powell said the military concentrates on high

ZBT to host boxing match

By Heather Gahres
Sta_[f Writer

Pitt’s Greeks will be duking it
out to prove which is the strongest
fraternity on campus this Friday
night.

Zeta Beta Tau members are
sponsoring the amateur boxing
tournament to help raise money
for United Cerebral Palsy. The
members came up with the Battle

of the Greeks idea from other

campuses.

“We had ‘seen the idea on
other campuses. We felt there
was no reason why it wouldn’t
work here. The Greek system
spends a lot of time competing
for points and money. This time
they will compete just for fun,
and hopefully the rest of the
university will enjoy seeing it.
[T he tournament] will be more of
a show than a match,” Lee Terkel,
co—chairperson of the
tournament, said.

This will be the first Greek
boxing tournament, but Zeta Beta

COUGH STUDY   A
Children's Hospital

The ENT Department is conducting a
study of coughing in adult (>18yrs)
patients with recent onset coughs (8-48
hrs). One hundred healthy adult patients
with cough due to a cold will be studied.
On the afternoon before the study, the
potential subjects will report to Children’s
Hospital of Pittsburgh for a physical
examination. On the following morning
the enrolled patients will remain in their
home for 24 hours and wear a microphone
which broadcasts cough sounds to a tape
recorder. During that period, patients will
take a test medication and must remain in
their homes, but are otherwise
unrestricted in their activities. Patients
will be reimbursed a total of $200.00 for

completing, the study. For more ‘
information call Children’s Hospital at

692-6037.

Tau is planning on making this
an annual event.

“This will be our first annual
Battle of the Greeks. Most likely
our charity will change. We like
to vary our philanthropy because
of the various organizations that
need our help,” Terkel said.

There will «be 24 men
participating in the event. All but
two of the participants have no
prior boxing experience. The
tournament will be conducted by
professional boxing promoters,
judges and areferee.

Jeff Strickland, who will be
representing Phi Sigma Kappa,
said he is looking forward to the
tournament.

“I’ve thought about boxing
before, but I’m too old to do it
seriously. It's a good opportunity
to get some amateur boxing
experience since there’s no
boxing club at Pitt,” he said.

Mark Lovett said he volunteered
to represent Sigma Alpha Epsilon
because he thought _it would be
fun. '

Women ’s studies marks 20 years

 

By Christine Hanna

News Assistant

Pitt's Women’s Studies Program
is celebrating 20 years of helping
to give students a more rounded
education in terms of accom-
plishments by women.

Through the program,
established in 1972,
undergraduate students can
obtain a Women’s Studies
Certiﬁcate with an undergraduate
degree, self—design a major
through liberal studies or take
women’s studies courses to meet
the education requirements.

A minimum of 18 credits of
WSP courses and a cumulative
2.00 QPA in those courses are
required to receive a certificate.
WSP Director Susan Hansen said
that at the present time there are
70 people in the various stages of

. the certificate program.

Hansen said the program does
not offer a major because it is not
a disciplinary department. WSP
is also not in the position to act
like other departments in regard
to tenure. The professors who
teach WSP courses already have
a home in other departments.
Hansen is a political science
professor.

“On the whole, werely for the
cross-listed program on
contributions from [Pitt’sl
departments. They have been
more than supportive,” she said.

ButHansen saidthatshe would
like to see more development in

the sciences and health sciences.

“We need more_women faculty
in those areas,” she said.

In addition, Hansen said that
Pitt does not provide as much in
respect to budget and staff support
as other universities do.

“We do not have resources
comparable to other universities.
We cannot even compete with
small colleges in Pennsylvania.
There is room for growth,” she
said.

Many major universities and
small colleges offer women’s
studies programs. Some programs
are very ambitious with majors
and full-time staff, but most are
like Pitt's program.

Undergraduate students
enlisted in 7,000 hours of WSP
cross-listed courses, Hansen said.
The enrollment is up 70 percent
over the last five years. _

“Many of the courses close as
soon as registration opens,” she
said.

Courses range from Sex and.

Racism to Women & Literature to
Psychological Aspect of Human

Sexuality to Women in Politics. 7

Hansen said women have made
changes in many fields, but there
is no disciplinary area or ﬁeld
that she has heard of where
women are paid more than men.
She added that the value of
women in this society is no where
near the value of men.

“We by no means exclude men.
Men are more than welcome in
our courses,” Hansen said. “Issues

of gender are a concern to

I everybody.”

She said that men should take
some of these courses because
they are increasingly working with
women; it would be in their best
interest. -

There is a 15 to 20 percent
enrollment of men in WSP
courses. “We have had a couple
of men receive certificates in the
past,” she said.

WSP also offers graduate
program options. Graduate
students may choose a minor in

women’s studies, a master’s

degree in Interdisciplinary Studies
or graduate elective courses.
Hansen said that she feels the
quality and quantity of research
on gender in all disciplines has
definitely improved. WSP has a
Women’s Studies Bibliography
in Hillman Library that contains
current and historical material.
WSP also offers internships and
an independent studies program,
sends out newsletters, sponsors
conferences and guest speakers
and is involved with the National
Women Studies Association.
Megan Terry of Omaha Magic
Theater will be coming April 13
to speak on “Women’s
Contributions to Contemporary
American Theatre: Generations
in the Continuum.” Also, Omaha
Magic Theater will combine
dance, sculpture, poetry, music
and visual installation in a
performance piece, about
censorship. ,

members of BAS’ Committee for a Black Cultural Center.

Committee members kicked off a distribution of historical
facts called “bullets” during their Great Slave—Holders Week,
February 17-21, held in response to the country’s celebration of
President’s Day and the University of Pittsburgh’s recognition of
Great American’s Day. I . H

“lIt’sl like you don’t even count when they call someone who’s
a slave master a ‘great American’ and don’t even put an asterisk
under it or don’t even discuss this person,” Justin Laing,
chairperson of the CBCC, said.

The bullets were invented to give students a better

’ understanding of the committee, present ideas not found in the

classrooms and enlightenstudents on the way history has been
presented compared to the way it really was, Laing said.

discovered that the best way to combat society’s ignorance is

‘ The Graduate and Professional .

Student Association will be
helping to promote public—safety
awareness at Pitt by purchasing
1.00 Quorum Personal Attack
Alarms to lend to graduate
students.

A PAAL is a portable alarm
system that emits an ear-piercing
alarm when the cord is pulled out
of the box. Once the pin is
replaced, the alarm will shut off.
PAAL comes with a nine-volt
battery that will continueto sound

for two hours, although the battery
should be tested once a month.

The main advantage of a PAAL
is that it cannot be used as a
weapon against you. ’

Graduate students who have to
be on campus at night or even
during the day will be able to sign
a PAAL out for the term. Graduate
students who wish to purchase
the security device can also get
them for $19 through the GPSA,
as opposed to the retail price of
$29.

GPSA President Steve Parks said
that many foreign teaching
assistants and graduate students

who are perceived to be gay have
experienced harassment and that
this is an immediate action to
protect all graduate students from
violence.

“I know a lot of graduate
students, especially women
graduates students, who spend
late nights in their offices until 1
or 2 a.m.,” GPSA Business
Manager David Fitz said.

“We think it is a good way to
use our Student Activities Fee for

graduate students,” Fitz said. The _

GPSA will be using reserved funds
from last year to finance the

project.

According to Fitz, the GPSA
Assembly, comprised of
representatives from individual
graduate schools, liked the idea
of investing in PAAL. _

Sergeant Charles Grier of the
Department of Public Safety said
that he thought PAAL is a
worthwhile device that students
should seriously consider
investing in. It has been proven
that criminals do not want to
attract attention, he said.

Brennan said that Public Safety
will be buying five of the devices
and officers will be familiar with
the sound. “We won’t ignore them
when we hear them,” he said.

Carnegie Mellon and Duquesne
University are both pushing the
devices. Pitt will be selling them

in the University Book Center for

the product. One device will be

“So now we have a whole

Huggins said.

This theory was eventually
abandoned, but people still have

mistaken ideas based on too little
evidence. He cited theories which
compare human reproduction to
that of other animals.

Undergraduate Research Fair

  Thursday, April 2, 1992
11:30 a.m.“to 2:00 p.m=.~[V
Assembley Room,
William Pitt Union

Undergraduate students from around the
University will present posters showing
their independent research. All interested
parties are welcome to attend!

The Undergraduate Research Fair is made
possible by a donation to the University
Honors College from the Teachers for an

Independent Faculty and is co—sponsored
by the University Honors College, the
College of Arts and Sciences, the School
of Engineering, the School of Library and
Information Science, and the School
of Nursing.

doesn’t'work when you say
humans are necessarily

programmed for reproduction.”

Other studies found that some
gay men had lower levels of
testosterone, so doctors tried
giving the men large doses of the
male hormone. They basically
ended up with “horny, hairy
homosexuals,” Huggins said.

The latest research indicates
that the hypothalamus, a part of
the brain associated with sexual
activity, may be smaller in gay
men. Nothing has been proven,
Huggins said, but the theory has
become a joke in the gay
community. x

“If someone is being a really
big [jerk], we’1l say, ‘Man, his
hypothalamus is simply too
large,”’ Huggins said.

Most people now believe that

being gay is a complex matter of
the physical self, which may be
oriented more to one sex, but
that the environment also plays a
part, Huggins said.

“Notice, though, that I never
said it was a choice,” he said. "It’s
not. That would be like asking
people if they chose to be left-
handed.”

Huggins then asked the

audience to envision the most
stereotypical “faggots” and
“dykes” they could. The list under
“faggot” included: nicely dressed,
effeminate, non—athletic, dancer
or hairdresser and very emotional.
In the “dyke” list: masculine,
wears men’s clothes, short hair,
truck driver or gym teacher,
American Gladiator and athletic.

“Now clear your minds and
picture the person I am

describing, ” Huggins said. He read
the lists and proved to the

audience that the list for “faggot” A

described a woman and the list
for “dyke” described a man. '

“It shows that a significant
amount of discrimination and
hatred is a result of a feeling that
‘These people are not like us,”’
Huggins said. -

The discrimination caused
Huggins many problems as he
was growing up. He used to try to
lower his voice when he talked,
and he made sure his legs were

spread in a “macho” way when r I
he sat down. Before he came out, I
. he used to save pills to try to kill

himself. At 21 he married his
hi gh—school sweetheart and lived

a monogamous, heterosexual life _

before he realized he couldn’t
continue to lie.

university," Guy said.

He stressed the importance
of academics in the black
community.

.“We all want a community
we can be proud of. We want
students to realize the world is
changing. The steel mill and
factory jobs are no longer
available,” he said

Guy was formerly involved
with Black Activist Students’
Intercollegiate Struggle.

He said the purpose of BASICS
is to create a network of African-
American students in
Pennsylvania which works as a
support mechanism for other

’ organizations in times of
difficulty.

As a first-year student, Guy
was a member of the political-
action committee, which, he
said, fights the injustices black
students must deal with.

“It’s like our Marines,” Guy
said. “We looked at the
university to see what was
wrong and organized protest
marches. It’s an important part
of BAS." ,

Tiwanda Taylor, formerly the
chairperson of the Black Action
Society's programming
committee, is the newly
appointed deputy chairperson
of the BAS.

Taylor’s duties as deputy
chairperson include developing
financial-aid workshops and

assisting in implementing
programs such as BASICS and
Community Outreach.

“Most students feel they are
too busy to get involved. By
being involved with BAS, I’ve
been to soup kitchens, high
schools and black businesses
in Homewood and the Hill
District, ” Taylor said. “Pm really
excited that I'm able to do
that."

Taylor is majoring in both
communications and black
studies.

She said she plans to teach in
inner-city schools, specializing
in either history or
English.

“Teaching is a profession
where you have an active role
in the development of a child,”
she said. “In the inner city,
especially, you don’t get
teachers who are interested and
enthusiastic. They don’t care,
and one of the most
important role models are
teachers."

Taylor, whose mother is
involved with various women’s
organizations and the church,
said she was not verbally taught
to become active in the
community.

“It was something unspoken,
something you should do. Both
my parents are satisfied with
the choices I’ve made," Taylor

said.

Taylor said the experience

she’s acquired through BAS has

carried over to her family life.
“I talk to my sister's children

about the Afro-American history

they don’t learn at school. It

strengthens the ties I have with
them," she said.

The local church, as well as
her family, is a significant part
of her life, Taylor said.

“The importance of the church
has been ongoing in my
family for many generations.
It is a basic institution in
my life and a strong
institution in the black
community.”

Taylor, who also works part
time at a mental-health agency,
said she had to learn good time
management and has put herself
on a strict schedule.

“I have work, tests and my
duties at BAS. There are times
when it gets to be too much, so
I delegate certain respon-
sibilities," she said.

“I have at least three or four
people I can definitely count
on. I don’t have excessive time
for parties or anything like that,”
she said.

Although she’s given up a lot
of her social life, Taylor said
she ’s excited to be a part of BAS
due to the caliber of the people
involved. _

“You will, in the next few
years, hear about them. They
will be productive in any ﬁeld
they go into,” Taylor said.

Brennan said that someone on

Public Safety will sponsor
security workshops on April 2, 3,

at these meetings will be an

Brennan said that a main topic

said.

He explained that the weapon
is only useful when it has the
proper information to contradict
popular misconceptions.

This is why the committee
named its bits of opposing data
“bullets.” ‘

Each bullet distributed by the
committee closes with the
statement, “Just another bullet
for your gun.”

According to committee
member Andre Mullings, this
means that “the mind is really the
weapon that needs to be used,
not physical weapons like bombs
and guns.”

While the first concern is to
educate African—American
students, Laing said he hopes
that the bullets will help everyone
“shake that paradigm of America
as a beautiful place for everyone.”

The bulk of the distribution is
done by members, who pass the
bullets out on their way to" and
from class.

Though they said they realize
that they cannot reach everyone
through this means, their budget
does not afford them enough
money to make a tremendous
amount of copies or obtain
advertising space in The Pitt
News.

Committee member Sydney
Westbrooks said she placed a

According to Westbrooks, many
students reacted belli-gerently
toward the bullets by ripping

them off the walls and
writing nasty letters in
response.

“That encouraged us even more
because we realized that this

information has to get out. People -

shouldn’t be afraid of facts,”
Westbrooks said.

 

Escort idea questioned

Campus-safety concerns have become a daily part of
campus discussion. Ideas, thoughts and advice to create
a safe campus concern students.

With numerous sexual assaults and armed robberies on
campus this past academic year, one idea bandied about,
to safeguard students, has been instituting a campus
escort_ service.

At Monday’s Panhellenic Association meeting, two
members of the Inter_-Fraternity Council judicial board,
Jeremy Weiss and Douglas Segal, proposed a strategy of
escorting.

A “Greek Guardian” system would have six to -10 male
escorts for guests at fraternity parties. The suggestion
recommended two men be stationed on the hill, two men
stationed in North Oakland and one in South Oakland.
Another male would serve as a dispatcher from the IFC’s
office. ‘ ,'

In response to Monday’s proposal, Jennifer Fink,
Panhellenic internal vice president, said, “I think the

escort service is a great idea. The Greek community is so ’

large that it will touch at least some people and cut down
on the safety problem. If the program works, we can
expand it to the rest of the college community.” _

Escort service is one option to address campus safety.
However certain considerations must be taken into account.

The proposal given at the Panhellenic Association
meeting demonstrates an active role students want to
have in relation to campus safety. By taking individual
action, a clear message is sent to the many campus-safety
committees and to the administration. Students are
confused and want solutions. ‘

Due to legal constraints, the “Greek Guardian” escort
service will not be ‘implemented this Friday as planned. It
won’t be used this semester. ,

‘ “From an administrative viewpoint, if this thing is going
to work, we want it to_work right. We have to make sure
that every avenue is covered,” Student Government
Board member Derrick St. Clair said.

In fact, the Student Government Board is working on a
proposal for an escort service. i _

Interestingly enough, Monday’s well-intentioned
proposal raises issues that will have to be worked out
before implementation. Legal responsibility for escorting
individuals will have to be ironed out. In addition, the
gender of the escorts should be mixed. All—male escorts
faced opposition from women at Miami University of
Ohio in the late 1980s. A V .

According to Weiss, “It was‘ not our intent to administer
[the escort program] without strict IFC approval. It was
only our intent to run the program on a trial basis with the
intention of foreseeing any glitches before wasting any
precious IFC time with regard in the matter of public
safety. All too often too many great ideas are brought
about with little or no exploration into possible difficulties
of implementing any such programs. We simply wanted
to cover all of the bases,” Weiss said.

Care should be used in the implementation of _such a
proposal. Sometimes trying to do the right thing may not
be “the right thing.” '

Presidential year oﬂers change,

Amazing things are happening
in the queer ol’ U.S. of A. Since
my coming out, all those years
ago .— just over three now —_—_I
routinely gointo shock at what
my queer brothers and sisters are
able to accomplish in a sometimes
very nasty homo—hating world.

Growing up gay in America
has never been a wonderful
experience. Completely silenced

and ignored, gay childhood in
America is a lonely time. But”

things are improving -—— greater
visibility has ignited the gay ’90s.

Politics this presidential year is
certainly a time for surprises.

First, I could have been seen
orbiting the moon last month
when I read The}! dvocate, an L.A.
based gay and lesbian oriented
newsmagazine. -“Righton Right
Winger” stood out as’ an
interesting headline.

In response to a query from
gay New Republic editor,_Andrew
Sullﬂixgap,‘ | an jcqngressional
representative responded, ’“I don’t
see any reason to expel someone
from the military, for purely private
sexual behavior. And I think if
you're heterosexual in the military
and you use your position to
exploit somebody you ought to
be similarly expelled.”

I am used to hearing statements
like this from Democrats, but
these words were uttered by the
Republican minority whip of the
U.S. House of Representatives,’
Newt Gingrich. This man is one
of the most high ranking

conservatives in the Republican
party. For him to show support
for a hot issue for queer liberation
is mind—boggling.

Gasping over the above-
mentioned news, last month
Pennsylvania Senator ‘Harris

Mark  
Smith

.Wofford became the 15th co-

sponsor of the federal gay and
lesbian civil rights bill.

Go Harris!

The '
legislation has 114 co—sponsors
in the House and 20—some in the
Senate. Without a peep from the
hetero-media, this marks another
key sponsor to a bill outlawing
discrimination in housing,
employment,public
accommodation and education
by amending the 1964 Civil Rights
Act. to include the words “sexual
orientation.”

Last month brought a great
shock to my system.» Officials
with the National Gay and Lesbian

Task Force met with the head of

President Bush's re—election
campaign, Robert Mosbacher.
They ‘discussed issues at the
forefront of the queer liberation
movement. This is believed to be
the first time in history that a
Republican incumbent met with
national lesbian. and gay civil
rights leaders.

At last I am beginning to see
the work of thousands of civil
‘rights activists pay off.
Withstanding the hard right
Reagan and now the Bush years
‘forced queers, as well as the
entire civil rights community, to
entrench and buttress for the_
storm. In the process, it made
queer activism stronger now than
even -
No longer do we have to be
horse-whipped for votes by
opportunistic politicians. For my
entire life, Ihave seen gay, lesbian

1*’ and bisexual people put into a

 three ring circus — having our
non—discrimination ’& lives reduced to a carnival act for
politicians hoping to feed off the

hate.

Pat Buchanan typiﬁes this with
his homo-art ads and . Bush.
Buchanan is treating America to
an advertising campaign
somehow linking Bush to
homoerotic art and the National

Endowment for the Arts. But news .

to Pat — this time it's going to
backfire and people will see these
actions as hate-inspired. Few
conservatives will make such
complete idiots out of themselves
in the public eye.

Those who are interested in
‘ issues of social and economic

justice should band together this
el_ection.\We have a chance to
break the conservative strangle-
hold around our throats".

Greek sing skit not ‘blatantly’ sexist

The issue of sexism and fraternities is a serious

One.

And I believe that the skit performed by Phi
Kappa Theta Fraternity at Greek Sing [March 26]
was no way an example of sexism.

Judging by the roar of the audience, as you

yourself said, I would say the
main point of entertainment was
successful.

Not the sexist ideology you
implied. In fact, after Thursday’s

performance, sorority members congratulated the
humor in the act without even mentioning the

sexist implications.

which improve college life and

Lacrosse wins league championship

By Jeremy Swarbrick

In its own version of the fabled
“Backyard Brawl,” the Pitt lacrosse
club overcame a slow start to rout
the Mountaineers from West

‘ At the outset of the game, it
looked as if Pitt was going to

Virginia grabbed an early lead
just 1:50 into the game on a goal
by Bill Rigney. WVU threatened
to increase its lead minutes later
while playing in a man-up
situation, but Pitt goaltender Scott

Mountaineer attack and keeping ‘
the game close.

Pitt broke into the scoring

The Pitt men's track team started itsoutdoor season  ~ -

Despite numerous injuries, P-itt’s

men's outdoor track and field"

team began the season on a good
note last weekend in the 1992
Panther Relays at Pitt Stadium,
according to head coach John
Vasvary. ‘
“We ran some good times and
used it as a workout, something
to 1. build onefosethe.a:est...of . the
season," Vasvary said. '
Senior Brett Shields missed the

meet because of the cold weather"

and his knee bothered him. “He’ll
be ready for next weekend,”
Vasvary said.

Meanwhile Wes Alexander was
also out because of a knee injury,
and Chris Douglas had a leg
injury. Both are not believed to
be severe. _

But Scott Humphrey," one of
Pitt’s'distance runners, will ‘miss

the remainder of the season with

a stress fracture. _
Instead of using seniors,Pitt

‘picked it up with some of its

younger athletes. Frank Nesko, a
_first-yearstudent, finished first in
the 5,000 meters with a time of 14
minutes, 49.9 seconds. He was

“followed by Jim Hamilton at

14:59.0 andJamie Hibell at 15:55.9
to give Pitt the top three finishers
in the event.

Sophomore Jim Monk finished
first in the shot put at 51 feet, 2
inches and second in the discus
at 132 feet.

Wayne Smith and Waddle

Panthers. ' -’

The competition will b
increasing next weekend as Pitt
will send some athletes to the
Colonial Relays at William and
Mary, and the Miami Gatorade
Invitational, at which Pitt did very
well last year.

“It’s a notch up, very good

-The Panthers have some

Women’s hoops signs
two high school stars

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Sports Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team is
looking forward already to playing next
season as a whole team, something it
never was last year. .

The, team lost all—time leading scorer
Lorri Johnson, center Connie Hurt and
reserve forward Whitney Mack to
graduation. Still, the Lady Panthers were a
good young team. Then 5-foot, 9~inch
guard/forward Jenine Joyce left the team
for medical reasons. Transfer Shannon
Davis, a highly regarded 6—3 forward, left
school. The worst loss came next, as point
guard Maureen.McConnell quit school.
The team never was able to replace her.

Now Pitt just might do it. Lady Panther
recruit Stephanie Petho, who can also play

shooting guard, might settle the point

guard position.

Petho averaged over 30 points per game
for her career and 37 per game last season
on her way to 2,667 career points at St.
John Central High School in Bel Aire,
Ohio. She made the all—state team last year
and was also recruited by West Virginia
and Syracuse.

“She’s an unbelievable scorer,” Pitt head
coach Kirk Bruce said. “She’s the kind of
player who can come in and help right
away. She can help us with other people,
moving Erin Maloy to two [guard] and
Jenine Uoycel to three [small forward].
There’s always a possibility [that she could
start]. She definitely has the ability to d
that.” y *

Petho will join at the point a_mix of
Maloy and Carol Morton, who started part

of the season as a walk-on first-year player
last year despite having never played
organized basketball. Morton, whom Bruce
said had a good year, all things considered,
will be on scholarship for the coming year.
Morton and Maloy were not able to solidify
the position last season.

Pitt’s also added some much-needed

size with its other recruit, 6-1 forward/ ,

center Teresa Bolfert from Homestead
High School in Mequon, Wis. Bruce
described her as a good player inside or
outside who runs the floor well and passes
well. Bolfert scored 20 points a game last
season as she made the first-team all-
North Shore Conference and honorable
mention all—Milwaukee Area. She was also
Ozaki County Player Of The Year the last
two seasons.

“Hopefully she can get some quality
playing time,” Bruce said. “We need inside
players. You can never have enough.”

Bruce said she will join five inside
players the team will count on next year.
That includes starting forward Jonna
Huemrich, starting center Carolyn Miller
and reserve forwards Turia Ransom, Julie
Fornadel and Tiffany Fingers.Ransom, a
Big East all—rookie selection in 1989-’90,
returned from after a lost sophomore year
due to academic problems to give Pitt a
solid scorer inside along with Huemrich
before being hobbled by an ankle injury.

Bruce said he was pleased with his
recruiting class, pointing out their academic
ability as well as their basketball ability.

“They are both excellent students.

S Stephanie was first in her class, and Teresa

was in the top 5 percent of her class,”

Football players not
stereotypical jocks

By Scott Kaplan
For T be Pitt News

Editors Note.- This is the second
of three articles in Scott Kaplan’s
series "From the Sidelines.”
Kaplan is a placeleicleer for Pitt’s

football team.

-Part 2 — Perceptions

Last week in one of my classes
the discussion was athletics, and
from the opposite side of the
room, one of . my classmates
blurted perhaps her most
prophetic words of the semester:
“The football players here have it
made: They don’t have to go to
class; they get their grades given
to them and have you seen the
cars they drive?"

My response to her was one of -

disbelief.

“Really,” I said.

“Really,” she said. “Some of the
players live on my floor, and they
don’t have to do a thing.” _

At this point of the argument, I
decided to enlighten my classmate
as to what it takes to be a football
player here at Pitt. My intention
with this column is to enlighten
some of you who may believe
the same thing about college

athletes.

First, I certainly do not blame
my classmate for thinking this
about football players. She is like
the rest of our society, which
sees and hears the controversy
but never reads about the good.

About five years ago, Sports
Illustrated did a preseason story

on Brian Bosworth, the linebacker

from Oklahoma who was
suspended from the Orange Bowl
for a positive steroid test. The
article in 31 said that he was a
good student, but people will
remember him for the bad

because they saw more of that. ’

In that same issue of SI, there
was a player mentioned by the
name of Robert Schilken. He
played at a school rich in football
tradition. He never was the great
football player he was expected
to be, but he made the most of his
college career  at Pitt. Long
forgotten, Schilken is now a
doctor. It is players‘ like Schilken
that give athletes a good name,
but we don’t hear enough about
guys like him.

Instead, we hear about Joey
Jock, who failed out of school, or

Baseball loses three to Redme

By Cory Walborn
Staff‘ Writer

The Pitt baseball team was so

close but not so far away from '

upsetting the top team in the
Big East: St.John’s,--The Panthers
ended up on the wrong side of
the error column and on the
wrong side of the scoreboard,
dropping three games to the
Redmen, 3-2, 4-3 and 7-4.

“St. John’s takes advantage
of every mistake you make,”
‘Pitt head coach Mark Jackson
said about the Redmen’s ability
to capitalize on the Panthers’
five defensive errors. “They
made fewer mistakes than we
did, and that is why they won.”

On Sunday, Pitt opened the
three-game series with a stellar
performance from junior right-
handed pitcher Bill Junker.
Pitching the first game of a
seven-inning double-header,
Junker (3-1) pitched seven
innings with the game tied at 2-

. 2, only to lose the game in the
eighth, 3-2. Three Pitt errors

hurtJunker’s chances atwinning
his fourth straight outing.

Junker took the Panthers into
extra innings while scattering
five hits and allowing three runs.
“Billy [Junker] pitched well in
the first game,” Jackson said. “It
was the best pitching
performance of the series.”

On the other side of the
mound, it was lefty Tom
Danulith (1-1) combining with
reliever Jeff Brown (1-0) who
held the Panthers to three hits
and two runs. Leading the
Redmen with the bat were
outfielders Joey Pulsonetti and
Mike Dicono.

In the second game of the
double-header,, Pitt busted out
of its first-game hitting slump
with 11 hits. Leading the Panthers
were catcherJerry Berteotti and
first baseman Greg Christman.
They combined for eight hits

and four RBIs throughout the

series.
But an 11-hit barrage was not
enough to stop St.John’s, which

again found a way to win in the
latter innings. Redmen pitcher
Mike Burke (1-0) picked up the
win with one inning of relief.

St. John’s managed only six
hits off the Pitt pitching staff,
but it made the hits count,
scoring one more run than the
Panthers and winning, 4-3.
Panther pitcher Jamie Goettler
(1-1) pitched two and two-thirds
innings while losing his first
game of the season. 1

After the double-header on
Sunday, Pitt and St. John’s got
together again on Monday,
finishing the three—game series
with a single nine—inning game.
This time it was St. John’s that
got an outstanding performance
from the starting pitcher, Ken
Grzeleczyk. Grzeieczyk hurled
seven strong innings to improve
his record to an impressive 3-0.

Both teams hit the ball well.
Combining‘ for 21 hits and 11
runs, this game provided more
offensive excitement and a

llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, April 1, 1992

By Brandy L. Simms
Staff Writer

-It was almost one year ago
that I attended a high-school all-
star game at the Civic Arena that
showcased several of the nation’s
top seniors. Among those featured
that evening were Pitt recruit
Orlando Antigua. But also
competing were four players
headed for the University of
Michigan: Chris Webber, Jalen
Rose, jimmy King and Juwan
Howard. When they signed with
Michigan it became apparent that
the Wolverines — at least for the
next few years — would be a
good team, but who could have
imagined that they would be this
good this soon?
Rayjackson is the ﬁnal member
of that class, which, has been
dubbed the Fab Five. The
Wolverines have a chance to go
_down in history as the youngest
team ever to win a national
championship. And just think:
They’ll be around for three more
years — unless anyone from that

group decides to turn pro.

-All the schools headed to the
Final Four in Minneapolis this
week have been there before.
Cincinnati, Michigan, Duke and
Indiana have all won national
championships in the past. Duke,
of course, is the defending
national champion but is making
its fifth consecutive trip to the
Final Four and its sixth in the past
seven years. Michigan I won a
national title in ’89, when it had
Glen Rice and Rumeal Robinson.
Cincinnati, which had great teams
in the ’60s, won- titles back-to-
back in '61 and ’62 but lost to
Loyola (III.) in ’63. Indiana
captured its first title in 1940 but
also won championships in ’S3,
'76, ’81 and ’87.

-If Michigan beats Cincinnati
and Duke beats Indiana, it would
set up a rematch of a game played
back in December inwhich the
Blue Devils prevailed in overtime,
88-85. However if Michigan and
Indiana win, it would set up a Big
Ten final. Ironically, the last time
there was a Big Ten final in the

national championship game was
back in ’76, when Indiana
stomped Michigan, 86-68.
oWhen Duke tips off against
Indiana Saturday evening, Blue
Devil I head coach Mike
Krzyzewski will be up against his
former coach and mentor Bobby
Knight. Krzyzewski played for
Knight at West Point in the late
’60s. Krzyzewski has already faced
PJ Carlesimo, a good friend and
fellow assistant coach on the U.S.
Olympic basketball team.
-What a tournament this has
been! Who'll ever forget the
individual performances turned
in by Shaquille O’Neal during

LSU’s brief title run? How about A

James Forrest’s buzzer-beater with
only eight—tenths of a second‘ left,
which gave Georgia Tech a trip
to the Sweet 16? And finally, who
will forget Christian Laettner’s.
fadeaway jumper, which stole an
upset victory away from Kentucky
and gave the Blue Devils a shot at
becoming the first team to repeat
since UCLA did it two decades
ago.

exception. The Panthers did
not wait around for the
Mountaineers to take control
of the game — they grabbed a
4-5 lead on Lehman’s second
goal just :58 into the new
period, giving Pitt a lead the
team would never surrender.

A minute later, Stember took
a pass from goaltender
Knowles and sped coast to
coast, depositing theball in
the the WVU net and doubling
Pitt’s lead to 5-3. Gochnauer
and Ed Croot would team up
to give Pitt its sixth goal of the
game on a one-timer from in
front of the crease.

The Pitt team appeared to
be in control, looking as if it
was going to kick another
league opponent out of Pitt
Stadium tagged with a

humbling defeat. But WVU

stubbornly came back, getting
two goals in a minute and a
half, leaving Pitt ahead by only
the slimmest of margins, 6-S.
Spurred on by their second
comeback of the game, the
Mountaineers came inches
from knotting the game up
and taking the lead when one
of their shots rang off the left
post and another almost found
its way to an empty Pitt goal,
left naked when Knowles was
caught out of position.

Pitt’s slim lead increased
when Gochnauer took a Daryll

Schmitt pass and again found
the back of the net with less
than two minutes remaining
in the half. The offense still
had a little more for the
Mountaineer defense when
Stember and Gochnauer
(again) rounded out the
scoring and gave Pitt a
comfortable 9-5 lead at the
half.

The second half began in
much the same fashion it
ended, as Dave Kounas ripped
a “worm-burner” past
Mountaineer back—up Nate

_ White just 54 seconds into the

young period, increasing the
bulge to five.

For the remainder of the
quarter, Pitt’s offense never let
up, rolling off six more goals

»in the third to take an

insurmountable 16-6 lead
into the game’s final period.

Goals by Croot, Craig Leslie
and Gochnauer (yes, another)
closed out the scoring for the
Panthers in the fourth_period.
Gochnauer led all scorers in
the game, tallying six goals
and four assists. Stember also
added six goals to the winning
effort.

“We took a good team in
West Virginia and dismantled
them,” Pitt head coach Gary
Neft said. “We set a goal to 4
win the championship in
January, we worked hard and

we got it. It just feels great.”

got arrested, or came in as a Prop
48. Those things are all negative
and all that people will remember.
Controversy is what people
remember, and that_is why they
think the way they do about

athletes.

I would like to tell you about
what it really takes to be a football
player at Pitt. I don’t know what
other schools do or how they
operate, but when you sign to
play football here at Pitt, you do
something (contrary to my
classmate’s belief).

In my first column I told you
about the 6:30 a.m. running, the
four-days-a—week of lifting
weights and the long hours put in
on the ﬁeld for practice. Forget
all of that because none of it

matters. There is a more important .
- ons.

issue here: life.

Whenl told my classmate about
the hours of running and lifting,
she rebutted with a great answer:
“It’s their choice.” i

Wrong! Playing here is not a
choice because when you, as a
player, decide to buy into this
program, it becomes a
responsibility.

We are the people now
responsible for representing this
university because when
someone turns on ESPN and sees
Pitt, we are who they see. We are
responsible for the whole place
and everybody associated with
it -— fromthe chancellor to the
guy who brings you a new
mattress in the Towers. And we
are responsible for you, the
students. Maybe you don’t see it
like that, but that is the way we
have to see it.

Are there more important things
than football? Of course. Do the
coaches care about us after
football? Of course. Outside of
the main meeting room in the
stadium is a list of all the Pitt
football records. Right next to
that is something more important
—a list of the top 10 QPAs on the
team.

In the Paul Hackett system of

football, academics are the’

priority. Why? So that when we
leave here, there is more than

football on our résumés.

Imagine taking 15 credits. Then
having to attend six hours of
study hall a week. Then having
to meet with various tutors six
hours a week. Then having to
practice six days a week. How
about learning a foreign language
called “offense and defense?”
What about dealing with the press
and the pressure of the big game?
What about all the hours of film
study? Aren’t. those things
something?

“But you guys get your school
paid for,” said my classmate.

True, but there are people on
academic scholarships who I am
sure will tell you that they don’t
put in this kind of time. And not
all of the players have their school
paid for.

Some guys are known as walk-
They don’t get any
scholarship moneys; they do it
because they love football and
want to contribute.

Think about that: You get no
money, and you put in all this
time. These are the people who
deserve credit and don’t deserve

I-lere is something to think
about: We have to live our lives

When Joe Fraternity fails out of

Joe Football fails out of school,
he gets to be nationally humiliated

news. .

How about whenJoe Frat gets

Bruce said. “That is just one

less thing you have to worry
about.”

Small forward could be less
of a worry with the return of
another player who did not
play for Pitt last season: Joyce.
She averaged only 5.8 points
per game as a first-year player,
but she came on strong late in
the year and was expected to
be a key player last season.

“She’ll be all right,” Bruce
said. “It’s not like someone

new coming in. She knows
what it takes.” -

Pitt returns every player
from last year’s team. Still,
Petho could be the key, filling
two problem areas for the
team last season.

“[The team] is looking
forward to next season,” Bruce
said. “They are looking
forward to having a full team.
The attitude is the best it has
been since this group has been
here. Everybody feels like they
have something to prove.”
