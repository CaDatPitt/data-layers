At Meeting

Group Will Warn
Absent Members
Of New Resolution

Beginning with less than a
quorum but working up to one,
the official moiitlily meeting of
SFA was held last Tuesday even-
ing in the eighth ﬂoor conference
room.

There was no discussion of any
kind concerning the recent SFA con-
ference with Dr. John Weber, secre-
tary of the University.

Presumably to bolster attendance
at the meetings, Francis Durkin,
BA39, moved that “all members ab-
sent for two consecutive meetings
should be sent letters asking them
to show reasons why they should not
be ejected.” Provision was made
that the places of members ejected
from the body should be ﬁlled in ac-
cordance to last year’s elections;
that the runners-up would be given
seats in accordance to the vote they
polled.

Suggestions concerning the Cath-
edral were given by the Building
and Grounds committee. These sug-
gestions, which include the sale of
cigarets in the Tuck Shop, men and
women smoking room on the third
ﬂoor, bulletin boards at the entrances
to the Cathedral, and better equipp-
ed smoking rooms will be forward-
ed to Dr. Weber. -

Discussion of the Tuck Shop
brought up the problem of card play-
ing. Jack Hoeveler, Ba40, suggested
that a room be set aside for bridge
with an “NYA supervisor to see that
there’s no gambling.”

Theodore Biddle, assistant to the
dean of men, announced that the
change in the University seal last
year necessitated a change in the
University ring. The new ring is
available to seniors and holders of
degrees from the University.

Registrar Releases
Complete Campus
Fund Drive Results

Ninety-eight and one-half per
cent of the University’s Commun-
ity Fund quota has been raised or
pledged, J. G. Quick, registrar and
chairman of the general University
drive, stated in releasing the total
results of the drive.

Missing the quota by $150,
$9,849.98 was raised by the faculty
drive, under Mr. Quick, and the
student drive, under Dr. Vincent
W. Lanfear, dean of men, and
William Mendenhall, executive
secretary of the YMCA.

In order to facilitate the payment
of the student pledges to the Com-
munity Fund, a booth has been
placed in the ground floor elevator
lobby of the Cathedral. Students
will not have to go to the treas-

Mr. Mendenhall said.

Last year’s drive went over its
quota by approximately the same
amount that this year’s is under-
subscribed, figures show. Al-
though the average contribution
this year was less than last year,
the number of contributors was
sufficiently large enough to main-
tain almost the same total of
money.

Fewer students contributed this
year, however, and the average of
97 cents which set a city-wide rec-
ord last year was lowered to 95
cents. A total of $2,654.58 was
received from 2,796 students,
$2,254.43 from 2,329 undergradu-
ates, $400.15 from 467 graduate
students.

A total of $7,195.49 was received
from 980 faculty and administra-
tion subscriptions.

News Reviewer Praises

‘Kind Lady’

By Dorothy L. Hughes

The opening of Edward Cho-
dorov’s “Kind Lady” Wednesday
evening in the Stephen Foster Me-
morial Theater proved that the Play-
ers are capable of presenting as pro-
fessional a play as any group of am-
ateurs in Pittsburgh.

The entire cast showed an extra-

ordinary ability for dramatic tim-é

ing, both in “getting over” comedy
and in working up to a tense dra-
matic climax. Throughout the play,
aesthetic distance was maintained to
the point of carrying the entire audi-
ence unrestrainedly into the life of
the characters.

Miriam Harter as Mary Herries,
the kind lady whose unwise charity
leads her into grave trouble, was
most convincing in the difficult
scenes where in she must appear to
be mentally unbalanced, yet hold
the audience to the belief that her
behavior is perfectly sane. The fact
that Miss Harter is not an actress by
profession was‘ apparent only in her
inability to avoid distracting atten-
tion from her lines by unnecessary
movements of her hands,

Bernard Mayer as the unscrupul-
ous Henry Abbott, who cleverly di-
rects the scheme to take possession
of Mary Herries’ property by impos-
ing on her kindness, puts into the
part all the conceited self-conﬁdence
and half-likeable, half-despicable
courage and charm that such a vil-
lain would need.

Laura Jean. Smith as Lucy Wes-
ton, an affected but rather lovable
English matron, created a character
of real charm.

Pegg ' Megee as sophisticated
Phyllis Glenning and Robert Botkin
as the very American Peter Santard
were delightful in their laugh-get-
ting team-work, which was aided by

Mr. Botkin’s remarkable comedy-
timing technique.
l‘.-lary Walter as Ada, Abbott’s

moron wile; Richard Frankel as Mr.
lidxvarcls. the jovial albeit determin-
ed Izencliinan to Abbott; Edna Kanti-
man as Mrs, F_dwarcl-s; Nancy Welfer
as Aggie, their incorrigible daughter,

were all indescribably funny, quite‘

irresistible rascals. ,
Roberta Webb as Rose, the loyal
maid to lviary Herries, was sincere
and believable. '.

All fraternity men are invited to
visit the ~Dithrid,ge street fraternity
houses during the evening of Jan-
uary 6, the ﬁrst of this year’s Inter-
fraternity progressive dances.

Phi, chairman of the dance commit-
tee, has announced that the follow-
ing fraternity houses will be hosts to
all fraternity men that evening:
Kappa Sigma, Sigma Chi, Phi Delta
Theta, Theta Chi, and Pi Lambda
Phi.

These dances were originated last
year by the Interfraternity Council
as a means of promoting friendship
and goodwill among fraternity men.

progressive dances will try to outdo
each other in arranging novel enter-
tainment and decorations for the
evening.

Eger has promised an enjoyable
evening for every fraternity man

United States in. great numbers, a

large majority of the college youth
of this country believes, the national
poll of the Student Opinion Surveys
of America reveals.

These ﬁgures are the ﬁrst an-
’nounced ‘by the new Student Opinion
Surveys, organized with The News
as one of the cooperating members
among college newspapers over the
nation.

Campus interviewers have ap-
proached students of every descrip-
tion. They have asked, “Should the
United States offer a haven in this
country for Jewish refugees from
Central Europe?”

YES, said . . . . . . . . . .31.2 per cent.
N0, said . . . . . . . . . ..68.8 per cent.

-But it was clear from the coast-
to—coast returns that students as a
whole would like to see the United
States help oppressed German minor-
ities in some Way, some suggesting
the offering of homes in U. S. posses-
sions. “No country should turn away
people who bring so much with
them,” said an Illinois senior.

“But where would we put them?”
asked a University of Minnesota
sophomore. Others deﬁnitely believed
none should be allowed admittance.
Noticeable was the qualiﬁcation, “If
other nations help also.”

gregated in the East Central states,

On the question of whether or
not professional football would re-

Pitt Puckmen Face Case,
Yale During Holiday

We’ll blame it on the 13th of the
month.

The Panther hockey team downed
Baldwin Wallace 4-0 last Tuesday
night in what was probably the slop-
piest game the Panthers have played
in the last two years.

To open the three-act comedy,
Coach Mcsorley started a line of
men who usually play defense. In-
experienced offensively, they were a
pitiful sight, and the harder they
tried the worse they got.

Dream Line Stars

When the next line, Lowe, Artz,
and Schuldecker went in, it seemed
unable to forget what it had just
seen; consequently it produced al-
most the same show.

At this point, Irv Artz settled
down and began making solo dashes
that brought hope to a now slightly
disgusted audience, but, not until the
Brittain - Friday - Schooley combina-
tion took the ice was anything like
real action to begin.

The “mighty mites” or “dream
line,” as they have been more re-
cently called, showed the superiori-
ty that so far this season has been
latent. Even though they, too, were
guilty of loaﬁng now and then, they
left no doubt that they were the best
trio on the ice.

At 7:30 in the ﬁrst period,
Schooley, taking a pass from Friday,
caught the B-W guard sleeping and
put the puck in the open corner of
the net.

Yale Plays Here

It wasn’t until 7:06 of the second
period, and not until a lot more bad
skating, passing, and stick work had
been digested by the onlookers, that
Dick Friday got loose to skate the
length of the ice and score the sec-
ond goal unassisted.

At 2:26, Friday again passed to
Schooley who had ample time and
openi.ng to push in the score.

At 8:08, Friday made another solo
dash to glance the puck off the goal-

‘§}tcnder’s glove and again score unas-

 The game ended—the Pitts had
Ewon 4-0, but everybody was very
lunhappy about the whole thing.
‘ There had been no team work.
§'l'he smooth offense that the Pan-
fithers have showed in previous con-
iflicts was entirely lacking. The stick
iwork and skating was lackadaisical.

Dick Friday on the offense and
Walt Lovett on the defense were the
;two redeeming features of the game.
lF'riday, having two assists and two
goals to his credit, was a spark.
Lovett, covering up and checking
hard and close, did his job so well
that Goalie Ellis had only one stop
to make in the whole game.

Tickets for the game with Yale
on January 2 may be secured in
the athletic ofﬁce, 27th ﬂoor, Ca-
thedral, for twenty-ﬁve cents up-
on presentation of an athletic
book.

In the third period, Friday and
Schooley repeated.

With two games scheduled-during
Christmas recess, the hockey team
will have no vacation from its ice
duties. Meeting Case in Cleveland,
December 29, the Panthers should
encounter very little trouble.

Yale at Duquesne Gardens on Jan-
uary 2 will be another story.

Yale, long a power in Eastern in-
tercollegiate hockey, wil probably
be the toughest team the Panthers
will encounter this year.

Panther Cagers

Duke, Cornell

Duke plays host to Pitt at Durham,
N. C., tomorrow night for the second
time within a month—only this time
Dr. H. C. Carlson’s basketballers will
be the visiting Panther entourage.

The Duke game will be one of

three scheduled for Christmas re-
cess. The “must we pay” Richmond
game at Virginia follows the Duke
encounter, and then the Panthers
swing north for the home-opener
with Cornell.
Injury has already cut into the
sophomore packed Pitt squad, and
Eddie-Stroloski, who starred against
Northwestern, may frequent the
bench during the Duke game. Strol-
oski injured his ankle against the
Wildcats, and George Kocheran will
move up to the varsity if Stroloski’s
ankle fails to mend. by game time.

The Duke team that the Panthers
face will be paced by veterans. These
Carlson teams have built a reputa-
tion that makes the provincial out-
ﬁts set themselves for a tough game.
They point for Pitt and cause the
Carlsonmen no end of trouble.

lvloving along at a fair pace, Phi
Gamma Delta has ﬁnally overtaken
the leaders, Kappa Sigma, in the
“All Point” race.

At the termination of touch foot-
ball, Kappa Sigma led the Phi Gams
by a single point. However, the Phi
Gains have scored 12 points in the
winter sports program to nine for
the Kappa Sigs to move ahead, 269
to 267.

The race is a four cornered affair
with Delta Tau Delta directly on the
heels of the ﬁrst two with a total of
265, and Phi Delta Theta is also in
the thick of the running with 260.

Phi Kappa Alpha still ranks in the
ﬁrst five with 2-17 points for their
total.

Phi Kappa has an excellent chance
of gaining during the program with
the additional points that their bask-

etball and ping pong team should
add.

THE PITT NEWS

;If I May Point

 Robert Saffron

Let us lay this ghost for good. I mean that- appari-
tion of The Chronic Dissenter which is raised when any
expression of opinion is made by a professor or student
here. ,

What is this education we are avidly pursuing?

Dr. Pickens E. Harris, associate professor of educa-
tion, speaking on “What Is,Progressive Education?” be-
fore the Social Science seminar this week, deﬁned edu-
cation as a dynamic concept, interpreting and making
signiﬁcant the whirl about us. As he put it:

The Truly Educated Student

“Questions and issues that are inevitably controver-
sial, because individuals see life differently, must consti-
tute a large part of the curriculum if it is to be prop-
erly realistic or faithful to the principle of experience.”

In this changing world, we must grope for new values.
It becomes increasingly obvious that the cultural ideo-
logy handed down to us from an agricultural society
simply does not ﬁt now. The concepts of personal in-
itiative, competition, freedom, with which we have been
indoctrinated, do notgapply in the same way to a ﬁnan-
cial-industrial economy. ' We may even suspect that
these concepts are an abracadabra cast by sincere high
priests over a‘ dark magic.

Youth Questions, Experiments

Fortunately, the temperament of youth looks for the
new idea, it questions and experiments. “But instead
of cherishing this faculty of youth, by ﬁring their imag-
ination of a better world, and by sustaining them in
their readiness to lose themselves in unselﬁsh service to
worthy causes, the academic school soon envelops them
in the paralyzing inertia of an unconsidered, calculating
morality, from which they may never escape,” Dr. Har-
ris said.

In short, I maintain that the encouragement of this
critical faculty is an essential function of educttion. In
a democracy, there is no progress without this prodding
and shoving. A wild idea is proposed; in the ensuing
argument a compromise is reached, and the new synthe-
sis may be adopted.

Even if most of our opinions are proved wrong, let
us strive to have a superabundance of them, for there
may be a few valid ones left. The ignorant man has
only one idea—-which may be wrong.

It is the obligation of the college student to his gen-
eration to be wisely skeptical, to enquire, at least——to
think.

“Safety Drive.”

For the first time the Student
Opinion Surveys of America have
uniﬁed campus opinion on a na-
tional scale. Student interviewers
from Maine to California and Ore-
gon to Florida, in every part of the
country and in schools of all kind
and: sizes, have asked, “Do -you be-
lievehprofessional football will some
day" become more popular than col-
lege football?”

YES, said . . . . . . . . ..24.2 per cent.
NO, said . . . . . . . . . ..75.8 per cent.

But although one in- every four
believes this is likely to come about,
not even that many would like to
see such a condition. Only 14.6 per

the Survey points out. In the Eastern
and Middle Atlantic states, students,
28 per cent of them, think the pos-
sibility of professional teams gain-
ing a greater following is acute. In
other sections the percentages are
much less.

Editor, The Pitt News. l
Dear Sir: I

I would like to spread a few bou-
quets and orchids for the ﬁne cooper-
ation given me in connection with
the Safety Drive on campus, which;
ends today. ‘

I want to thank you as editor ofi
The Pitt News which certainly coop-
erated to the fullest extent. Your
editorial and news items aided con- ‘
siderably in keeping the campus
“safety conscious.”

William Morton, C40, and Howard
Lazear, C40, deserve commendation
for their ﬁne work and assistance
sticking stickers and posting posters.
The SFA Traffic and Parking com--’
mittee proved its merit by its ﬁne
work, and can be justly proud of a
ﬁne campaign.

We are grateful for the coopera-
tion of the Tuck Shops, on the eighth
floor and on the ground floor, for
their enthusiastic support of the
The Building and
Grounds department came in for the
dirty work removing stickers after
the drive. I want to thank them for
the fine spirit in which they re-
ceived all this extra work, saying
“it’s a good thing.” l

‘Last but by no means the least, I
wish to thank the students for their
wholehearted support in this under-
taking. I hope you will keep your
posters on your cars during the hol-
idays. I wish you all a safe Merry
Christmas and a safer New Year.

Don’t forget “Be Happy —— Go
Safely.”

Edwin F. Ellis, C39,
Chairman of the Safety Drive.
