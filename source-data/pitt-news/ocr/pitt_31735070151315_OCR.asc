homicides to

Pitt researchers released a report
Tuesday in which they claim that
almost a third of homicides in Pitts-
burgh could have been prevented.

The Center for Health Equity
in Pitt’s Graduate School of Pub-
lic Health began conducting the
Community Violence Prevention
Project in August 2012. Through
the project, researchers analyzed

all 42 solved or unsolved homicides ’

— more than 95 percent of which
resulted from a gunshot wound
— that occurred within the city of
Pittsburgh in 2012.

Researchers aimed to identify
the underlying causes of homicides,
including peer conﬂict and other
social factors. They also traced
homicide patterns that indicated
a prevalence within certain demo-
graphic groups and neighborhoods.‘

According to the report, eight
of the 42 homicides resulted from
peer violence. The researchers
deﬁne peer violence as occurring’

between individuals who know one .

another.
“Perpetrators and victims often

I know each other and move in simi-

lar circles,” said Steven Albert, the
chairman of Pitt’s Department of
Behavioral and Community Health
Sciences.

The researchers argue that"

STUDENT GOVERNMENT _ jg _ — I
Board appoints new Webmaster to update site

Danielle Fox
Staﬁ’ Writer

Robert Burger started his own
website design and computer
graphics company during his
senior year of high school.

Now Burger, a freshman
majoring in computer sci-
ence, will design a new website
for the Student Government
Board, and he isn’t charging
them a’ single cent. But he
does want some recognition,
including his name listed on
the website.

“I’m hoping it will give me
some networking opportuni-
ties,” Burger said, who joked
that he was “doing it out of the

kindnessof [his] heart.”

The Board previously em-
ployed webmaster.Mahen Sen-
eviratne to manage the website
and_ update its behind-the-
scenes programming. Senevi—
ratne said that SGB paid him
roughly $7 per hour during
the 2012-2613 school year.

Burger said he does not plan
to_ seek compensation from
the Board or stay in the po-

-sition long-term. The Board
appointed Burger as webmas-
ter to update the current SGB
website and begin working on
a new, more manageable web-
site. He will use Wordpress,
a free content—management

system, which will allow the
Board members to make revi-
sions to the website without
a webmaster’_s help. Bhrger

initially met Board president

Gordon Louderback through

‘ Emerging Leaders, a program
that aims to foster leadership _
skills in students, where the‘
~ two discussed the state of

SGB’s-website and Burger’s
past computer experience.
Board member Mike Nites
said that it would be easier for
Board members to make an-
nouncements and maintain the
websitethiemselves — some-
thing that does not take ex-
tensive knowledge of HTML,

the website—programming
language — if Burger creates
a more intuitive webdesign.

“We can login [and make
changes], and we don’t have to
know how to [computer] pro-
gram to do that,” Nites said.

On Tuesday night, Burger
updated the page that displays
the timesof the board mem-
bers’ office hours.lThe page
had not been updated since
last semester.

All of the Board members
will have profiles on the new
website. Burger said that the
Board members will have the

ability to edit their pages by them-
selves, allowing them to add informa-
tion “ifa new member does something
extraordinary,” such as receiving an
award.

The Board hired Seneviratne in the

fall of 2012 to update the website and to ‘

build anew one. Louderback dismissed
Seneviratne in September.

Nites said Seneviratne was not mak-
ing sufficient progress on updating the
current site and building a new one at
the time of his dismissal. Louderback
was not available for comment at the
meeting because he is in Panama work-
ing on an engineering project. 1

Seneviratne said he could not keep
up with the workload when he began

another job over the summer because
he was not living in Pittsburgh. He also
needed access to Pitt’s servers to work
on the website. A

. Burger said he will see the website
through to completion before trans-

ferring the upkeepVresponsibilities '

and moving on to resume work with
his computer business, Burger Group,
which he started in 2012. ., . -

HOMICIDE

these peer-related homicides are prevent-
able through intervention. According to the
report, communities can encourage positive
inﬂuences in the lives of youth who are at risk
of engaging in violence. ’ ‘ ‘

Community organizations, religious in-
stitutions and behavioral programslcan also
reach out to engage at-risk youth and provide
appropriate services. 4

Another12 of the murders the researchers
reviewed were not peer or gang related. In
the report, the researchers said these deaths
resulted from isolated conﬂicts, such as rob-
beries or home invasions.

Only three of the homicides were de-
scribed as gang related.” '

In threeothers, the motives were listed
as unknown. . H -

Albert said that the researchers began to
review the circumstances of each murder by
reviewing information from official reports.

He also said that investigators working
on behalf of the researchers visited the com-
munities where homicide victims lived to get
information on each victim’s background,
such as whether he or she was involved with
a gang and whether he or she knew the per-
petrators of their homicides.

“We might try to ﬂesh out the police re-
port a little bit,” Albert said. “But we’re not
trying to do police wor .” . .

The project also found that homicides
were most common among Speciﬁc groups
and areas in Pittsburgh. More than 93 per-
cent of homicide victims were male, and
more than 83 percent of the victims were
black. The most common age range of victims ‘
was 18 to 25 years old. I

PALLIGRAPH

Change the rules Congress abides by
to prevent future manufactured crises

' Rohith Palli
Columnist

Recently, Speaker of the
House of Representativesjohn
Boehner, R—0hio, let the gov-
ernment shut down in order to
adhere to the informal “Hastert
Rule,” where the Speaker of the
House does not allow for a vote
on a bill unless a majority of the
congressmen in the majority
party of the House of Repre-
sentatives approves of legisla-
tion. When the “world’s oldest
democracy” is subjected to
blackmail and extortion, when
legislation is decided by a mere
25.01 percent of congressmen
and even fewer voters, some-

thing needs to change.

The causes of this travesty.
are systemic: the two—party sys-
tem, congressional rules and
our outdated Constitution.

Ideally, we could rewrite the
Constitution to reflect demo-
graphic realities by eliminat-
ing Congress as it is currently
organized. Interests are divided
more clearly by rural versus
urban versus suburban rather
than by state. Furthermore,
a mechanism must be imple-
mented in order to eliminate
gerrymandering, or the shifting
of the boundaries of electoral,
districts to exemplify demo-
graphics favorable to a particu-
lar party, and bring the politi-

cal narrative back to the middle

. ground on which itbelongs.

So what can we do to im-
prove and unjam the federal

government? Reducing polar— ’

ization could be a potential path

I to pursue, first and foremost.

By bringing politicians toward
the middle, we create a situa-
tion where they can find more»
common ground: the basis for
good compromise.

The most obvious way to
eliminate polarization is to
undermine gerrymandering,
making it less accessible of a
practice. Less secured districts
would mean" more politicians

' This can be accomplished fairly eas-

nately, some state governments have
proven to be partisan, unjust and all-

A better process would be an instant-
run-off ‘system, although entrenched
media interests would detest such an
idea. In an instant-runoff election, vot-
ers rank their choices for a particular
elected office. The votes are tallied and
candidates are eliminated sequentially
by an algorithm. As candidates are elimi-
nated, the votes cast for them are moved ,
to those voters’ next choices. Ultimately,
two candidates remain and one o.f them
has a higher vote tally.

Not only would thissystem amelio-
rate extreme polarization, but it would
also shorten the election cycle to one
election day each year (rather than two,
a fall and asspring). Although this may
seem like a detrimental quality, since
less time would be available to vet can-

MEN’S SOCCER

Panthers offense sty

Staff W'rz'ter

The Pitt men’s soccer team (0—7—4,
0-5-2 ACC) was defeated by the
William and Mary Tribe (6-3-1, 1-1
Colonial Athletic Association) by a
score of 2-0 on Tuesday evening.
The match, which took place at
Ambrose Urbanic Field, was the
fourth consecutive match that the
Panthers have been held scoreless
and the eighth time this season the
Panthers have been shut out. Pitt
has scored only one goal in their
last seven matches.

“We know our effort tonight
was just not good enough. We can
make, excuses that we’re tired, but
ourperformance was nowhere near
the level of our previous two perfor-
mances” junior midﬁelder Michael
Tuohy said.

The Panthers started out well,
but were unable to sustain their
early success, allowing William

box and sent/a drive toward the right

goalie Dan Lynd. ‘
After the Tribe goal, the Pan-
thers were unable to produce any

Following the halftime break,
the Panthers,‘ desperate to try and
score the equalizer point: became

FOOTBALL

  Former Pitt stars return to form in week 6 action of the NFL

Sean Corrado
Staff Wr2'ter

After a week of lackluster per-
formances, former Panthers
football players rebounded and
ranked among the league’s best
in week six of the NFL season.

Despite being questionable
to play because of a nagging
hamstring injury, Arizona Car-
dinals receiver Larry Fitzgerald
(Pitt 2002-2003) ﬁnally broke
out, notching his ﬁrst 100-yard
receiving game of the year. He
nearly reached the century
mark in one play with a 75-yard
touchdown pass from quarter-
back Carson Palmer toward the

end of the ﬁrst quarter, at which
point the Cardinals commanded
a steady lead over the San Fran-
cisco 49ers.

Things went south for
Fitzgerald and the Cardinals
late in the third quarter, when
49ers linebacker Patrick Willis

recovered Fitzgerald’s fumble as_

the receiver approachedthe red

zone. San Francisco used the mo— '-

mentum to score 10 unanswered
points and hold on to the lead
for a 32-20 victory. Fitzgerald
ﬁnished the game with 117 yards
on six catches and recorded a
carry on a misdirection play that
went for four yards.

Former Pitt running back

LeSean McCoy (Pitt 2007-2008)
and the Philadelphia Eagles had
better luck as they earned their
second consecutive win with a
31-20 victory against the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers. McCoy rushed
25 times for 116 yards and caught
two passes for 55 yards.

With his strong performance

Sunday, McCoy maintained his A

statuspas the league’s leader in
rushing yards. He now has 630
yards on the ground — 99 yards

more than second—place rusher.

Arian Foster. That total is good
for a Philadelphia franchise re-
cord for a running back through
the ﬁrst six games" of the season.

McCoy fumbled on the sec-

ond series of the game in his

team’s own territory, but the
Eagles defense was able to hold

the Buccaneers to a ﬁeld goal..

The ball was knocked out ofMc—
C0y’s hands and recovered by
another Pitt alum, cornerback
Darrelle Revis.

Revis (Pitt 2004-2006), al-

though still adjusting to playing

in Tampa Bay’s zone defense,
was a defensive force for the
Buccaneers.in week six. In ad-
dition to his forced fumble and
recovery, Revis had four open-
ﬁeld tackles. On the other hand,
Reviswas unable to contain Ea-
gles wideout DeSean Jackson,
who scored two touchdowns on

the day.

San Francisco punter Andy
Lee (Pitt 2000-2004) averaged
48 yards‘ on six punts and pinned
a season-high three punts inside
his opponents’ 20-yard line.

Lee’s teammate, wide receiv-
e\r_]on Baldwin (Pitt 2008-2010),
is still trying to work his way into
the starting lineup for the 49ers.
He was‘ targeted twice and had
one reception for nine yards in
the win against the Cardinals.

With Lions tight end Tony
Scheﬁler dealing with concus-
sion issues, Detroit has signed
free agent Dorin Dickerson (Pitt
2006-2009) for added depth at
the position. Q

a good team coming in, but the effort level
was just not there,” Coachjoe Luxbacher said. i

Following their second goal, the Tribe con-
tinued to sustain pressure inthe Panthers’ half
of the ﬁeld, which almost resulted inanotlfer
goal when Reilly Maw sent his third shot of
the game toward the Panthers net and forced
Lynd to make a diving save. This save was one
of four in the evening for Lynd.

The match was the third that Pitt has
played in a week and snapped the Panthers’
two-match conference point streak.

“We got outplayed tonight, but it’s because
a few of our guys did not show up with their
‘A’ game tonight. We’ve tried many different
things to score, but it’s just not happening.
The main thing we [constantly] tell the guys
is that we do not go forward when we have
a chance. There are times when we have a
chance to take a shot, but we pull it back and
start again. You’ve got to take your chances
and take shots in the offensive third, and we’ve
got to shoot more,” Luxbacher said.

Pitt has four matches remaining this sea-
son, and just one of those is a nonconference
matchup. Three of the ﬁnal four matches for
the Panthers will be played at Ambrose Ur-
banic Field, with the lone road game sched-
uled for this Friday evening against No. 16
Clemson. Kickoff is scheduled for 6 p.m. at
Riggs Field in Clemson, S.C. '

“We all believe that [the ACC Tournament]
is still a possibility, and we know that the next

that we need to win at least two, but more
likely all three. Going forward, it’s going to
depend on other teams some, but we have got
to look to ourselves to get three wins,” redshirt
junior forward Cory Werth said. E
