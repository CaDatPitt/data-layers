Council
Opens
Book Mart

Exchange
Will Continue
Through Week

Men’s Council starts its ﬁrst
campus-wide service project
this morning when the Council-
sponsored bookexchaiige opens
at 11:30 o’clock in front of
Room 801, Cathedral.

Open every day this week from
11:30 to 3:30 o'clock, the book ex-
change booth will receive used texts
from students for sale at the begin-
ning of next semester.

First student-spoiisored book ex-
change on campus to receive and sell
books directly, the Men’s Council proj-
ject, headed by John Glasser, BA38,
is expected to mark a great advance
toward solution of the used-book prob-
lem.

Students wishing to sell books may
set the prices at which they shall be
sold. Used books may be purchased
directly at the exchange.

In addition to receiving books all
this week, the exchange will take
books for sale at the beginning of
next semester. To avoid the September
rush, it is suggested that students
deposit their books to be sold during
this week.

Books will be received on a consign-
ment basis. Unsold books may be with-
drawn from the exchange at any
time.

If the student is undecided on the
price at which his book is to be sold,
he may allow the manager to dispose
of the book at any reasonable price.
This service, however, is optional.

To cover costs of operation, 15 per
cent of the sale price of each book
will be deducted by the exchange; any
amount within the 15 per cent in ex-
cess of expenses will be deposited in
the Men’s Council student loan fund.

11 Sessions
Scheduled

For Summer

This summer, eleven different ses-
sion periods will be sponsored by the
University, according to Frank W.
Shockley, director of the Extension
Division and Summer Sessions.

Classes will be held on the local
campus, at Eric, Johnstown, at the
Engineering camp at Windber, and at
Wood’s Hole, Massachusetts.

From various universities, colleges,
and secondary schools in the country,
eleven visiting professors will be add-
ed to the regular staff members of the
summer session. ' I
'Information regarding courses of-
fered in the various summer sessions
may be obtained from the office of
the registrar.

Also, through the cooperation of the
Board of Education and the Bclleﬁeld
Trade School, free secretarial summer
school courses are being offered to stu-
dents of the University.

The six-weeks’ course offers the
study of the following subjects: office
machines and transcription, typing,
and shorthand. It is also possible for
students to take two courses. '

Application to attend the summer
session should be made to Miss Jane
Bryce, principal of the Bcllcﬁeld Trade
School, located on Fifth Avenue near
the Frick Training School.

Sesquicentennial,
Athletic Conflict, Campus

Politics Feature Year

By HERB RACKOFF

Headlined by a Sesquicenten-
nial celebration, an athletic
squabble of nation-wide propor-
tions, and political developments
which even the wildest seer
would never have predicted, events
at the University during the past
semester took one amazing turn af-
ter another in what proved to be an
especially newsworthy half-year.

As forthegoutstanding “Man in the
News,” no one man has as complete-
ly blanketed the newspapers thefway
football star Biggie Goldberg did last
semester, yet there were at least three
or four who came fairly close.

Headliners Named

Undoubtedly Chancellor John G.
Bowman, with his part played in the
Scsqui events, and the dedications and
cornerstone — layings still to come
should rank in this group.

As far as students are concerned,
William Stark, debating standout,
father of SI<‘A book chats and con-
cert hours, speaker of the Intercol-
legiate Conference on Governinen't,
and, more recenly, SFA executive
coimnitteenian deserves the top spot.

For the production of the one best
news story of the year the trophy
should be split between Joe Garcia,
whose miraculous mid-ﬂoor sho't won
the wildest Pitt-Duquesne game in
history to give Pitt its first city bas-
ketball crown, and Ernest Rose, who
astounded the campus by overturn-
ing all political plans ‘to slip in as
new SFA president.

But, to get right down to facts, no
story relates more concisely just what
all has happened since February than
a chronological review of the news
through the columns of THE NEWS.
So, without further ado, 1ct’s swing
into it:

Beauty Contest Starts

February 5. Students returning
from vacations are startled to read,
in screaming headlines,’ that The Owl
will choose its own beauty queen,
breaking all precedent. One subscrip-
tion, one vote. Bill Kern, Eddie Baker
leave Pan'ther grid co'achin_g staff.

February 9. SFA recommends
that Publications Board be enlarged
to include students.

February 10. Garcia wills "great-
est” game from Duqucsiie by drop-
ping in long shot as gun ends extra
period. Score: Pitt 51, Dukes 50.

of Mount Lebanon. Bud was assistant
sports editor when a junior, and came
panting into The News office at un-
seemly hours from track meets, swim-
ming _meets, and the stadium. When
a senior, he was appointed editor of
The News, and developed progressive

around this firetrap for some time.

Shorty Says So Long

Publications Seniors Leave 809

By SHORTY LONG

It is tradition in newspaper Work to write at the end of an
article, no matter how insignificant or brilliant, the number 30—

signifying that the story is completed.
This year we have ten young ‘men and women who will write
“30” to a four ’year “story” by_graduatiiig from the University
and bidding adieu to the dusty, noisy \

With the aid of his editorial asso-
ciates, he voiced his belief that a
student newspaper should represent
student opinion . .. . and no't the opin-

’-lots of luck!

The News will not be complete
next year without the beaming coun-

'I\/Ian CI The News’

Although our news commentator has chosen
for his “men of the semester” individuals who
have been consistently active and consistently in-
teresting “copy,” editorially we
have another category to ﬁll, that
of “Man of the News, 1936-37.”

For that office we nominate
Edwin H. Beachler, editor of
The News for the past year, who-
has officially released these col-
umns to the new staff today.

Actually, The News’ columns
were released to the staff some-
time last fall when a democratic
policy was initiated, a policy
that gave members of the staff a
chance for expression and a hand
in determining the content of
The News.

The Pitt News to Bud Beachler has been an
expression of student opinion in both theory and
practice, and in trying to make it that, he has run
into obstacles for which he, himself, assumed re-
sponsibility.

We believe that he has instituted a commend-
able and necessary policy, that he has succeeded
in seeing his plans carried toward their goal.

We might even go on to tell of Edwin H.
Beachler as a personality, but such things tend
to verge on the sentimental and detract from the
main theme. We will only repeat our nomination
—‘‘Edwin H. Beachler for ‘The Man of The
N ews’--1936-37."

BEACHLER

 

Things To Come . . .

HIS issue of The News, Volume XXVIII,

Number 88, writes a ﬁnish to a year that has
been in many ways both hectic and interesting
to the staff and possibly to the whole campus. It
is also the preface of another year that will start
officially next September with Volumne XXIX,
Number 1.

In its editorial columns this year The News,
whether its topic has been conﬁned to campus sub-
jects or to issues of national or international im-
portance, has. made no pretense of being anything
but student opinion.

In presenting this opinion it has sometimes
caused offense, sometimes been opposed by those
who have held different views. All of which, looked
at objectively, can be seen as only natural.

Next year many of the same issues will con-
front the student body. But the trend of things
to come will also prescribe new issues and new
developments of the old. And again The News
will express and reflect student opinion and will
attempt to take its stand as objectively as possible.

vl Houesr,
WON'T Be'BAD‘

 

By Milton Lehman

It may seem presumptious for a columnist to justify
the existence of his column, especially after a year has
passed and several hundred inches of editorial vanity
have escaped him and been recorded for all those who
would read.

Someone asked me several weeks ago (as someone
always will), “What is the purpose of your column ?”
I might have tried to explain in detail, but, rather
then argue, I said simply, "‘If you have seen no pur-
pose, I guess there is none. ’ -

But nevertheless, I continued to talk to myself and
enjoyed it immensely. While the editorial “we” have
been filling our assignment with sketches, criticisms, and
reviews, “we” still had the problem of self-justification.

Literary justification is certainly not deﬁnite. We have
been unable to deﬁne literature, and, consequently, we
cannot possibly justify all forms of writing for all kinds
of people. But if we choose to pigeon-hole, we might
conclude that there are two fairly deﬁnite types of
writing.

One kind we may call “utilitarian.” Posters, directions
for use on the bottle in your medicine cabinet up to
social novels of the Dickensian stra-tum may be called
utilitarian if their purpose is to educate, convince, or
analyze. In other words, the writing has an explicit
“use” in mind as it pours from the writer's pen.

The other type we may call “idealized" writing.
Externally it has no “use;" internally it tries to ex-
press emotion. The eloserlit comes to the new ‘form of
expression, the new technique in picture painting, the
closer it comes to its only value. ‘ g ~

That value is inﬁnitely higher than the scope of the
so~called practical writing. An escapist form, to be sure,
it is the realization of such things that cause spin-cours-
ing chills. The very much overworked moon cutting a
pure white crescent through alayer of clouds may create.
it; a thrilling symphony may bring it forward.

But our practical friends will tell us that we are being
sobby and sissy an-d silly, and that we had better settle
down to writing ad copy. But we have had the audacity
to put into metal slugs of type thoughts that have no
practical value and no utilityﬂto boot. That may be the
reason we have written what we have written. That is
the reason, we fear, that we have talked to ourself.

At any rate, we know how to write a—-—30——-, close
up our typewriter until September, and say to ourself
that we have had a lot of fun.

Letter To The Editor

Editor, The Pitt News,

In view of the undesirable publicity attending the
recent election of Ernest Rose as president of SFA, I
feel it my duty to justify his position in the eyes of the
campus.

Mr. Rose's election undoubtedly came as a surprise
to him, and members of the Executive Committee will
attest as to the fairness of the ballot. He in no way
campaigned for the position and was not involved in
any “sell-outs” or “shady political deals.”

Mr. Rose deserves, and I am certain he will receive
the whole-hearted accord and cooperation of the
Executive Committee and the Assembly in the coming
year. I earnestly hope that The Pitt News will receive
him in a more cooperative mood than that recently

demonstrated.

'l'hat’s my fourth wife, there, a.
photograph I took on our honeymoon.
See how the photo people have en-
largcd it and printed it on the three-
way folding screen, behind’ which I
keep my ash tray from Prussia.

That's quite a feat, I consider.
They've touched it up a bit, here and
‘there, and added some color to‘ her
check: a great improvement.

The fold. I will admit, divides her
face so that she seems to look at this
and that together, but that is a tech-
nical necessity. It was a choice be-
tween division of her face and the
removal of a foot: she reclines, you'll
note, and almost stretches off" the
side. .

The sand? It was a beach in North
Carolina, where we spent the honey-
moon. Fourth time. you know. I’d
seen the Falls and Colorado and all
that.

Another ﬂaw, there: I asked them
to blot out the roller coaster in the
background; they forgot:

tort her nose. It must be considered,
however. One cannot have perfection
in first editions--notably in photog-
raphy. You disagree? I thought it
quite a phrase——-a first edition in
photography.

No matter. Perhaps you would en-
joy the Prussian ash tray, see, he-
hind thc screen on this teakwood
table? I’m thinking of having a shot
of the Eiffel Tower superimposed.
Quite a jolt to Old Frederick I, eh?

UNE 4, just eleven days more, will see the pre-

sentation and laying of the cornerstone of the
Cathedral’s Commons Room (shown above) by the
Class of 1937. Started eleven years ago, construc-
tion on the Cathedral (top right) moved swiftly
ahead until the advent of the depression years which
threw unpredictable obstacles in the way of its
completion. Today the road’s windings are about
to end. The Cathedral will soon stand---not only
as a symbol of the long struggle of one man, Chan-
cellor John G. Bowman (lower right), against great
odds but also as an achievement of artistic and-

I utilitarian value to the spirit of education.

g.Oldest Copy Of Pitt News

Lists Jock Sutherland
.As Third String Tackle

The beginning of a great football
team with a great coach, Pop Warner,
and the mention of the then future
great coach, Jock Sutherland, as third
string tackleis one angle to the old-
est single copy of the Pitt Weekly
on record.

The particular number, December

I 4, 1914, yellowed with age, is of pe-

culiar interest to its owner, Jimmy
Baldwin, CE40. First of all, that pa-
per carried a story on his father, J.

- M. Baldwin, president of the senior

class, .

‘Arid then the storyin; the lower
left hand corner on page one. Bald-
win, Jr.,.explains it: ' _

“The Student Athletic Board, which
collaborated -with the Athletic Asso-
ciation of the University, had much
to do with the activities of athletes
on ‘campus. Myi clad,” Jimmy says,
“was president of the Board, too.”

The-story is brief. Haskell Indian
College, which later became Carlisle,
was to be banned by '3-the government
and moved out West. .Mr. Baldwin,
who with ‘Jimmy forms the oldest

family of Delta Sigma ‘Pi (now Phi.

Delta Theta) got three of his athletic-
minded cohorts together; for a brief
session. -

“Somehow the quartet discovered
the intended closing of Haskell, some
time bef.o.r.e..the. .n.ew_s. was expected to
hit the “papers,” Jimmy tells. The
four fellows, realizing that Glenn
Warner would be_ without a job,
boarded a train at _l,_2;30 o'clock one
night, arrived at Haskell the next
morning. With a- contzrhct in their
hands, the boys so ‘surprised Warner
that he -signed up.” ,i- 

The story in the paper states sim-
ply that Warner is expected to be the
next coach at Pitt. He signed his con-
tract a few-days later. .

' Worthy of mention is the lineup for
the game. H. C. Carlson held down
left end on the varsity; “Chalky”
Williamson was quarterback; Bob
Peck, called the greatest center of. any
Pitt team, monopolized the midpoint
position. 

And thep,-_you, must remember,
Sutherland was a‘ s'ar.‘.b.‘' ‘‘
