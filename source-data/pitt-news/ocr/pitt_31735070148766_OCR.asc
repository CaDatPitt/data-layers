It’s Tuesday night, and the sound of
horns trumpets through the air. A
drurnline taps out a fast staccato.

More than 200 members of the
marching band mill through the Cost
Sports Center during a tri-weekly
practice, blasting songs reminiscent
of football games and school spirit.
They’re not athletes, but they’re just
as integral to sports culture.

Drum major Will Cowan said that
the band is just as dedicated as sports
players, putting in hours of practice
for shows that might only last a few
minutes.

“Since Pitt doesn’t have a music
school which requires marching band
participation, everyone that is here
wants to be here. The members have
a great amount of pride every time we
practice and run out of the smoke on
game day,” he said.

It’s been 100 years since the Pitt
MarchingBand had its musical debut‘.
And in the last century, the band has
transformedfromaminisculeoctettoa
musical powerhouse that helps lead the
cheers for Pitt’s athletic programs.

Amodest beginning .

The Pitt Marching Band first ap-
peared as an eight—man band at a Pitt-

Ohio Northern game on Oct. 14, 1911.
The men sported scarlet caps with blue
tassels and only played classical music
and military marches on their instru-

ments,whichwere borrowedfromthe
Becker’s Music Store.

During World War I, Pitt Band ac-
tivities wete placed on hold. In 1919,
the band was reinstated with 60 mu-

sicians who received their first “real”
uniforms: blue overcoats with blue
and gold caps, paid for by the Athletic
Council.

On April 5, 1922, the -band gave its
ﬁrst home concert at Carnegie Music
Hall. Bythe late 1920s, the band repre-
sented male musicians from multiple
schools of the university.

In a few years, band enrollment
wouldberestricted to ROTC members,
as Pitt’s Military Department took over
its direction in the 19305. All bands-

men woreclassic ROTC uniforms and ‘

had to pass rigid musical aptitude and
marching tests.

“It was a military band. The uni-
formwasvery military with cross belts,
because inthe ’5os and inthe late ’40s

alterthewar,thebandwasintheRO'IC_

department,” said Pitt alurrmus Jack
Andersomhead directorofPittMarch—

' ing Band since 1994.

Anderson began playing snare
drums in Pitt’s marching band as a
music major in 1964. He went on to

become the band’s assistant director

in 1986; _ V I

“The band had a national repu-
tation back in the ’40s,” Anderson
said. “At this point, Pitt, Ohio State
and Michigan were like the big three.
Whenwe played Ohio Stateinthe early
’5os. That’s when Pitt, Ohio State and
Michiganwere dubbedasthebigthree
in the country.”

Times‘, change, tradition re-
In1972, the organization receiveda
new addition: femalemusicians.

“Females were added, baton twirl-
ers —— the Golden Girls —— started in, I
think,1975, and itjustchangedto more

popular-style music,” Anderson said.

More changescame in 1985 when
a 16—member color guard joined the
band.

Although the Pitt band has un-
dergone, a series of transformations
in the past hundred years, Anderson
said some aspects ofthe 1911 bandhave
 over throughout the years. H H _

' “The traditions of the ‘band have
stayed the same —‘ the ﬁght songs 
Since I’ve been head director; the style
of the band has stayed the same,” he
said. ‘‘We’ve done more in mytenure
to relate to the student section, sothat
at the football games, the students par-
ticipate in the touchdown dances and
ﬁrst-down cheers.”

Geoffrey White, a2002 Pitt gradu-
ate and former band member, said that
the 2011 Pitt Bandhas more structure
now, Comparedtovyhenitplayedatthee

After every practice and every
game, a different senior leads the en-
tire band -— including the color guard
and the Golden Girls —— in singing the

favorite traditions.

Gunning for the Best Candy

This Halloween, the “felon”
costume came in ‘extra-small, Ac-
cording to The Augusta Chronicle,
in Aiken, S.C., a 10-year-old trick-
or-treater pulled a handgun on a
woman whoa joked about stealing
his candy. Although we can only
imagine the talking-to that ensued,
one things certain: The personwho
coined the expression “like taking
candy from a baby” never met this
child.

A Heated Competition

Pizza rivalries can sometimes
grow pretty ﬁerce, but they’ve
never come to a head like they did
in Lake City, Fla., where, according
to ABC News, a Don1ino’s manager
burned down anearby Papa]ohn’s.
Although owners of the latter res-
taurant are doubtlessly incensed,
we hope they take consolation in
knowing-they’ve validated the “bet-
ter ingredients, better pizza” slogan:
Every menu item at their branch is
now brick—oven roasted.

Hitching a Ride to the Big
Leagues, I .-

Jocks on the West Coast can
ﬁnally rest easy. The “Piggyback
Bandit,” notorious in Oregon and
Washington for leapingonthe backs
of high school athletes, was ﬁnally
apprehended in Montana, accord-
ing to Helena-based newspaper
The Independent Record. Although
we’re glad the acrobatic assailant
won’t traumatize any more aspiring

come him to campus. Pitt’s football
team, after all, needs as many men
on the ﬁeld as possible.

Arm Boleyn

Although the French Revolution
was hardly a resounding success,
its most infamous tradition is ap-
parently still en vogue. According
to The Seattle Times, a Washington
man admitted himself to a hospital
after deliberately severing his arm
with a homemade guillotine. Before
doctors reattach the limb, we hope
they consider the beneﬁts of leav-
ing it separated. At the very least, it
would make an excellent decoration
for next year’s Halloween. |

Not voting to fund the Carnegie Li-
brary of Pittsburgh is about as heart-
less as ripping out the last chapter
in every Nancy Drew novel on the
shelves, sci I have_ conﬁdence that
Nov. 8 will end in a celebration at
the library’s Oakland hub.

Then again, I had similar.conﬁ-
dence in voter turnout for last year’s
elections, especially when free do-
nuts and coffee were distributed
along Posvar Hall voting lines. Un-
fortunately, I was let down. So for
the love of John Steinbeck, DVDs,
Internet access, Cosmo magazines
and cookbooks, please vote “yes”
this Tuesday. ' ‘

In case you haven’t heard, voter
ballots next week will feature a‘ref—
erendum on whether to approve a
0.25 mills special tax on Pittsburgh
real estate. The tax would charge
property owners $2.09 per month
for every $100,000 of calculated

Allegheny'Reg?ional Asset District
and the Commonwealth’ of Penn-
sylvania. However, state sources
of funding have been declining for
years, while the cost of providing
necessary services has risen. Thus,
additional sources are required.
’ Althoughyoumighthavenoticed
some renovations to the library’s

ment. More troubling, the Library

ies of its size,” accordingto the CLP’s
2010 report. .

For Pitt students, the advantages
ofthe Carnegie Library are numerous.
First and foremost, we’re allowed to
rent books we would otherwise have
to buy — either because they’re not
available at the University, because
other students nabbed them ﬁrst or
because they’re non- circulating. This

The library’s beneﬁts extend be-
yond rentals. According to_ the same
study, the CLP generates a return of
more than $91 million in combined
economic output and customervalue.
Allegheny County receives $75 worth
of beneﬁts for each resident.

Of course, we all know that the
Carnegie Library promotes literacy
and contributes to the community.
What often goes unappreciated are
its computers, which the library’s
fact sheet says provided*391,o00
hours of free access last year. This
service is vital for Pittsburgh resi-
dents who don’t have the Internet,
or sometimes even computers, to
maintain email accounts,‘ search for
jobs and conduct onlineresearch,
among other things.

of quiet study spaces).

Letters to the editor

To the Editor,

I am writing in response to the
Nov. ,3 column, “Wall Street isn’t
as villainous as some protestors
believe.” This article misrepre-
sents the Occupy movement and
its intentions. The movement is a
political protest, interested not
in disbanding Wall Street, but in
emphasizing the issues faced by
the general population in today’s
economic climate. Despite hear-

. ing that the economy is improv-

ing,‘ the general population is not
seeing this. College graduates are
unable to find work, and those

with years of experience in their
ﬁelds are taking jobs for which

they are vastly overqualiﬁed. The
Occupy movement is a way of call-
ing attention to the fact that the

government is caring only for the

ﬁnancial concerns of the wealthy,
at the expense of the taxpayers,
or the “99 percent.”

As a libertarian, I believe ful-
ly in a free market economy, in
which a competitive spirit and
personal control is encouraged.
Unfortunately, when the govern-
ment aids corporations that are
“too big to fail,” instead of help-
ing the rest of the population to
succeed in their own ventures (or
better yet — not getting involved
at all), it sends a message that the
government is only interested
in the largest corporations. The

ﬁnancial issues in this country
begin and end with the govern-
ment, and this is the reason for
the Occupy protests. Financial
centers simply lend themselves
to a public and appropriate forum
for protest.

Sincerely,

Jessica Gardner

To the Editor,

Last night I witnessed a terri-
ble -event on Pitt’s campus. After
my night class, I joined the Occu-
py Pittsburgh march in Oakland.
The march was approached by

organizers of the “Confronting ,
‘Apartheid: Voices of the Joint-

Struggle” event. This event" was
organized by Pitt’s Students for
Justice in Palestine, and they'wel—
comed Occupy Pittsburgh. This

event had already started, and

the audience was filled with Pitt

students and community mem-

bers. When the Occupy Pitts-

burgh group (roughly 15 people)
approached the doors to David
Lawrence Hall, they were con-

fronted by eight Pitt police of-
ficers who told them that they
were not allowed in because it
was private property. The Occu-
piers did not move and insisted

on their right to attend this event.

The police officers refused to let
them in, even though the orga-
nizers_informed them that they
were allowed. The police called
Executive Vice Chancellorjerome
Cochran, who sided with the po-
lice. The police told event orga-
nizers that they had 30 minutes
before they were forced to leave
(despite the fact that the event
had one and a half hours left).
Eventually, the policeallowed
the Occupy members in, and the

event proceeded as planned.

What is happening at Pitt?
What message are we sending
our community? Are we going
to let our administrators rule
this campus like a fascist police
state?

Thank you,
Emily Standridge

point guards that came before him, taking
aggressiveness from Carl Krauser (2001-

debut. I

lHe ﬁnished with a game-high four blocks

against La Roche, and his blocking ability
—— combined with Birch’s defense — could
make it difficult for opponents to score inside
this season. '

“I think [the blocks] got the momentum mov-
ing a little bit, discouraged the [La Roche]
offense and got the team hyped,” Birch said in
a postgame press conference. “It also helped
in transition and scoring buckets.”

John Johnson
Class: Freshman

Position: Guard

Height: 6’1”,—Weight:‘175

Johnjohnson is a versatile guard who defends
hard, passes well and can cut to the basket.
His style is reminiscent in many ways of for-
mer guard Brad Wanamaker’s.

“Every day in practice, I go hard,”JohnJohn-
son said. “I go as hard as anybody else on the

team, and I know Coach Dixon sees me going:

hard, so I think I’m going to play.”

Johnson said he lovesto play defense —— an at-
tribute that will ﬁt in well with Dixon’s system
—— and he also likes toislash to the basket.

He added that he’s working on his point guard
skills and involving his teammates.

Durand Johnson

Class: Freshman

Position: Guard '
Height: 6’6”, Weight: 190

Pitt’s freshman class also features theJohn-
son guards,John and Durand. Although they
aren’t related, Durand said they might as
well be. ' I

“Me and John, that’s my brother,” he said.
“We call each other -the Johnson Brothers.
We got to get that going on.” I

Durand Johnson is a natural shooter with
uniquesize and strength for’ his position.

In the 2010-2011 season,lhe helped guide his
high school team at Brewster in New Hamp-
shire to a 31-3 overall record and a berth in the
National Prep Championship Semiﬁnals.

Khem Birch

Class: Freshman
Position: Forward
Height: 6’9”, Weight: 220

The freshman class brings moreof what
Dixon loves: size, defense and rebounding.

Khem Birch’s defensive skills were on display
at the Blue- Gold Scrimmage. The ﬁve-star
recruithad three blocks and another two that
were called goaltending. A native of Montreal,
Birch has the potential to see signiﬁcant time
on the court this season.

A McDonald’s.All-American in high school,
Birch led the Panthers with 16 points against
La Roche. '

“I started off-slow because it’s different from
high school, but then I got adjusted to it as
soon as I scored my ﬁrst point,” he said in a
post-game press conference. '

With a logjam in Pitt’s frontcourt, though,
Birch might have to ﬁght for minutes this
year. .

Sophomorestake on leadership roles for young team

Sophomores aren’t usually expected to take on

! leadership roles, but they also aren’t usually the

oldest players on theteam.

’ This year, the six sophomores — and oldest
players —- on the Pitt women’s basketball ‘team
face the arduous task of leading the youngest
team in Division I competition. The oldest play-
ers on the roster are the three redshirt sopho-
mores, Ashlee Anderson, Leeza Burdgess and
Abby Dowd.

Burdgess described holdingaleadership posi-
tion as a sophomore as “pretty weir .”

“I deﬁnitely had to work on my leadership
skills and become more vocal,” she added.

Pitt lost four starters and ﬁve of its top scorers
to graduation. With them went74.9 percent of the
team’s scoring ability, 75.8 percent of its assists,
64.1 percent of its rebounds and 68.8 percent of
its minutes played from last year.

“You can only go up [from lastyear], andyou
can teach,” Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato said
about handling the young team.

Dowd joined the team midway through last
season as awalk-on. She transferred from Buffalo
where she started 25 of 30 games while averaging
6.5 points per game, shooting47.8 percentfrom
3-point territory and compiling 66 assists.

Cincinnati quietly allowed a conference-
low 59.1 points per game last year under Mick
Cronin, who signed a three—year contract ex-

The Bearcats qualiﬁed for the NCAA Tour-

Coaching style bu

Sean Corrado
Staﬁ’ Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team has been one of
the most successful programs in the country
over the past decade.

While the Panthers haven’t won a national
championship or advanced to the Final Four, they
hold the nation’s ﬁfth highest winning percent-
age (.794) over the 10-year period whilewinning
six Big East titles, four regular—season and two
tournament championships. * ‘

Much of this success came after current Pitt
head coachjamie Dixon arrived at Pitt with for—
mer head coach Ben Howland in 1999. In 2003,
after Howland leftfor UCLA, the University pro-
moted Dixon to head coach. V

Sincethen,he’swon several national and Big C

East coaching awards. Most recently, he was

' named the 2011 Sporting News Coach of the

Year.

Many of the athletes point to the Panthers’
coaching as areason for the team’s consistent
success. Dixon focuses on developing Pitt’s ath-
letes from the day they arrive on campus to their
last game. .

i “We are all about where they are going to be
and where they canbe,” Dixon said. “With time
must come progress.” .

The progress shows. The Panthers produced
six Big'East Most Improved Players over the past
10 years: Ricardo Greer(2000), BrandinKnight
(2002), Carl Krauser (2004), Aaron Gray (2006),
Sam Young (2008) and current guard Ashton
Gibbs (2010). ’ ‘ . A C .

Freshman Khem Birch is one of thenext
players ready to develop in Dixon’s system. A
McDonald’s All~American, Birch found himself
recruitedby majorprograms across the country.

_ But he chose Pitt —- largely because of his love

for the coaching staff.
Birch,doesn’t want the hype surrounding

Since arriving at Pitt,_]amie Dixon has
helped build a successful program.

his recruitment to take anything away from the
team. He said that Gibbs, a senior, took on the

» leadership role for the Panthers.

Birch said he justwants to “be afreshman,”ﬁll
whatever role mightbé asked ofhim and not “try
to do everythingtliatasenior can do.” He saidhis
goal this year is simply to gain conﬁdence.

He’s gained more than conﬁdence since he
came to Pitt. Through tough conditioning and
weightlifting programs, Birch — who appears
lanky at 6-foot-9 and 200 pounds —— has already
put on 10 pounds since arriving at Pitt.

“'I‘hat’s just another reﬂection of our program

andthings thatwe’ve seen over the years,” Dixon
said of Birch’s hard work in the weight room.
“When guys get here, they get better.”
Redshift freshman Cameron Wright is well
awareof the intensity Dixon brings to the court,
but he also seestanother reason for Pitt’s contin-

' ued success.

“There are always high expectations [at Pitt],”
Wright said. “Thatiswhy recruits want to come
here.” A

He added that Dixon brings the team to-

gether, building a close bond throughout the '
