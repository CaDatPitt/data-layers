J. Loch, SU Director,

Anticipates Remodeling
Before Building New SU

The new Student Union. building has been planned to
include bowling alleys, an auditorium, and other leisutre
time recreational facilities, according "to John Loch, director

of the Student Union.

Loch stated that the length of time necessary for the
completion of the new Student Union depends on the meth-
od of financing. According to Loch, there are three project-
ed sources of income. These include a st-udentife-e, Univers-
ity p:>.rticipation, and fund raising. The student fee will
take care of part of the construction costs and will be fun-
neled intogitems such as bowling alleys and lounges. Uni-
versity participation will also encompass part of the later
rnaintenance of the Union. Finally, the fund raising, which will
be in the form of alumni drives and foundation grants will provide
for most of «the construction costs. Loch stressed that “all the‘,

funds  be used.”

“These plans,” maintained Loch, “are not deﬁnite because
we must wait until the Board of Trustees approves the site of
the Union on the University building plan.” Loch didn’t know

whether the subject of the new
Student Union had already come
up before the Board of _Trustees.

“N 0 one knows what Dr. Pos-
var’s intention on the proposed
Union is, or if we can expect
him to have an intention yet.
Right now the Schenley Hall 10-.
cation is Posvar’s proposed site.

_ But the site may change if the

center of the campus shifts. This
shift,” according to Loch, “is

- not likely to occur.”

. Loch stressed that “we are at

‘least four to six years ‘away

from a new Union; so I am look-
ing toward the limited or com-
plete remodeling of Schenley
Hall, and then the ‘building of
the new Union.” This remodel-
ing would include the purchas-.

ing of new chairs and the reup-,

holstering of the present furni-
ture in Schenley Hall. Accord-
ing to Loch, this investment
would irnp-rove the facilities in
Schenley Hall, making them
more attractive to both the stu-
dents and the faculty.

UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

New Student Union May Beef
Constructed In Five Years   

by PAUL STOLLER

A new student Union will
be constructed in about four
or five years according to-
Dr. David H. Kurtzman,
Chancellor of the University.
This statement disclaims ru-
‘mors that construction of
the new Student Union build-
ing might start in the fall.

According to ’ Kurtzman, .the
University is now in the process
of completing a master growth
plan. “This plan,” said Kurtz-
man, “provides for the expect-
ed growth of the University.”
The partially completed plan
provides for building facilities.
in the Forbes Field area. Yet,
“There has been no decision con-
cerning the location of the. pro-
posed Student Union building,"
added the Chancellor. Even
though no location has been se-
lected for the new Student

“ed on the present site of Schen-

Union, it will be constructed at
a central location on the Uni-
versity campus. ‘

Kurtzman cautioned that “the
construction of the new Student
Union will not begin next year.”
But he also stated that “both
the Administration and the
Board of Trustees are as com-
mitted as any group can be to
the construction of a new Stu-
dent,Union building.”

With the proposed construc-
tion of a new’ Student Union
building, many have oﬁ'-‘red
suggestions concerning the fu-
ture of Schenley Hall. Some
have suggested that the new
Student Union should be erect-

ley Hall. The Chancellor related
the suggestion’ that “Schenley
Hall might be converted into a
faculty clu .” M

A “Since the construction of the
new Student Union is a few
years away, we have planned to

Pitt’s Morality Supplement
Draws-Nationwide Coverage

The morality supplement
The Pitt News (March 22),
has been receiving coverage
from the United Press Inter-
national (UPI) national wire
service since its publication.

On March 29, only one week
after the supplement was re
leased, articles appeared in news-
papers in Ohio, Texas, Florida,
California, Michigan, Louisiana,
Wyoming, Philadelphia, Missis-
sippi and New Jersey.

Subsequent articles appeared
in many other states with such

headlines, “U. of Pittsburgh Has .

lUniversities Get "Report on

Cheating, Etc.,” and “Pitt News-
paper Reports on Sex, Dope,
Cheating.” The extreme head-
lines reveal how, distorted head-
lines are misleading and not
representative of the story.

The report was not termed
“sensational expose,” but did
show that the University is typi-
cal of other universities in the
country, as indicated by reports
from other campuses, UPI arti-
cles noted.

The supplement, containing!
articles on cheating, marijuana,

_ premarital sex, and shoplifting,

showed, according to UPI re-
porter Patricia McCormack, “that
the school has cornered more
than its fair share of campus
problems,” and, “such problems
are an integral part of contem-
porary life in the halls of high-
er learning.”

Miss McCormack added that
“For thi reason, the report has

The “era” has spanned almost-
40 years. In 1928, Graduate As-
sistant Peterson appeared be-
fore -students as one of those
English grad students that every-
body comes across in his fresh-
man English course. Since then,
Professor Peterson has taught
literally thousands of undergrad-
uates in courses as varied as a’

Victorian literature section he i

had for 20 years, in the full
freshman English lectures, and
-most recently, ﬁction writing for
English majors.

With all of this behind .him,
Professor Peterson has more
than enough material for the
book on college English teach-
ing he plans to write after his
retirement. This work will add
to the number of short stories
he has published over the years.
He also wrote a novel, No Life
So Happy, which came out in

1940. The trout ﬁshing back-‘

ground (‘if the novel is another
pastime the professor will get
to after he “_. . . drifts out as
quickly as I drifted in.”

A ﬁne teacher is “drifting out”
after this term with none of the
fanfare usually granted to a

' m.ore famous individual, but this

is the way he wants it. He will
be sad when it’s all over, but
so will the many students who
know and respect him.

College Newspapers 
Reject New ‘Courier’ 

The Reader’s Digest plans to print and distribute a_. 5
college paper supplement next year has been rejected in a _
letter to the Digest by a number of prominent collegiate -
newspapers across the country, including The Pitt News. 
Other student newspapers opposing the move include the
universities: Columbia, Colorado, Michigan, Oregon, Penn-
sylvania, Purdue, Rutgers, Temple and Utah. 

The Campus Courier, as the supplement is titled, would ._'
contain selections from the Digest, and other sources, and-_ 

would be offered to about 62
college and university newspa-
pers in 15 separate issues.

Objections to the Courier were
caused by its production by the
-same uni-t of the Digest opera-
tions that also acts as national
advertising representative for
928 college newspapers, the Na-
tional Educational Advertising
Services (NEAS). Linda Gold-
stein, editor-in-chief of The Pitt
News, stated that she was in-
formed that only those news-
papers subscribing to the Couri-
er would have access to certain
NEAS advertisers. Those not
utilizing the supplement could
possibly lose -these ads, thus suf-
fering a loss in income.

Miss Goldstein noted that “we
could conceivably make a size-
able profit by accepting the of-
fer to publish the Courier, but,-
we have our own interpretation
of what college news should be,
and printing a supplement of

, this nature would be a. violation

of our concept.”

PHOTOGRAPN BY LEWIS HINE

She called it her “burning”
poem. And it was. It helped
ignite a flame of opposition to
child labor throughout America.

“My quatrain was literally
true,” Sarah N. Cleghorn said.
“The mill I wrote about actually
stood in the midst of a golf
course.” '

Today the American people
owe a debt to people like Sarah
N. Cleghorn and Lewis Hine. the
photographer. \Vithout her, one

writer said, “the history of the
United States would have been a
different thing.” Hine’s
photography, showing children
working when they should have
been in school, “was more
responsible,” the National Child
Labor Committeesaid, “than all
other efforts in bringing the need
to public attention.”

\Vc, the 450,000 members of
the lnternational Ladies’
Garment \Vorkers’ Union, are
proud of Sarah N. Cleghorn and
Lewis Hine. We are also proud
of our union which has taken a
leading part in the campaign to
outlaw child labor and to
improve wages and working
conditions.

Our signature is the union
label, sewn into women’s and
children’s clothing. It is a symbol
of progress made; and more
progress to come.

 When we learned that there is as yet no blueprint for a new Union,
I The Pitt News decided to pose the question to "our Chancellor and ascertain
“ where we really stand in regard to our Student Union.
Dr. Kurtzman explained that our new Union will be “constructed in
about fouror five years,” which is a far cry from the impression that was
left .with, many of us that construction for the Student Unioniwould begin
almost immediately. “The University is now in the process of completing
. which provides for the expected growth of the
University,” Chancellor Kurtzman stated, adding that the construction will
not begin next year. This state of affairs has led to plans to improve the

committed as any group can be to the construction of a new Student Union -

the previous season, nine other

ability, his team didn’t break

During our stay at the University, we have been forced to cope with
the present inadequate facilities and have definite opinions as to what our
needs are and how they will best be served. We suggest that Student Gov-
ernment attempt to pool the resources of ideas of ‘our student body, with

 

particular attention to the various student organizations. An important

_Association, to provide for themselves’.

the mistakes, the, bald eagle
shortened the half time from
ten minutes to three minutes, of
course, we all appreciated this,
since we were dead on‘ our feet
from chasing them all over the
ﬁeld. We lost, 6-0, and after the
game he said one of our full-
backs played a terriﬁc game.
This particular fullback was
watching or was supposed to be
watching Quy Busch, axjunior
All-American.’ By way, Busch
scored two goals and hadvthree
assists; ﬁve out of six goals
isn’t too bad. Just imagine if
the entire team had watched
their men as well as the full-
back who played a great game!

Let’-s not forget the transpor-
tation to the Slippery Rock
game, the Campus Bus: we all

know how well the Campus Bus ,

functions. It's ashame that this
had to to happen toan NCAA
team, when the footb-all team
stays in a hotel for home games.
Leo will never learn, he'll al-
ways settle for Kenard Field,
which is as good as a concrete
playground any day, let high
high school teams practice there
on our time, ‘then we practice
late and miss dinner, and apolo-
gize to men for not playing
them, even if they are terrible.
The funniest thing, since he isn’t

for‘ real, is that for the past

three years and I imagine ever
since he has been the “coach,”
he has never set a deﬁnite time
for practice. Imagine, a varsity
“coach” for 13+ years, and he
can't set a time for practices.

These are a few of the “high-
lights” of the past season, there
-are an inﬁnite number of them.

Like dressing four team-s, our '

freshmen team and varsity team,
and opponents frosh and varsi-
ty in the same, I repeat the

same locker room. I think these ‘

indicate that Leo deserves as
much criticism if not more than
Bob Timmon-s.

This, of course, means that he
is by far the poorer of the two,
Leo that is. I hope that the read-
er has enjoyed this, however, it
wasn't funny at the time. If you

’ want to see the worst coach in

the University, watch a soccer
game next year, a Pitt soccer
game, and keep an eye on Leo,
watch him go completely blank
for 88 -minutes. However, if you

potent Frank Carver to be re-

someone like Frank Carver or-
dered him. Thank you very
much for your attention.

Phone Service

Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to think that the
telephone switchboard at “Pitt”
is a unique situation, First, I do
not know of any other school
that has the extensions in the

a girl's dormitories shut off at the

early hour of 11 p.m..(this just
may be the case in another
school, though, and I would sug-
gest then, that they, too, try to

remedy the situation). What in-.
tensiﬁes this problem is that at _

11 sharp (on weekends at 12)
the phones are disconnected,
with no apparent consideration

for any parties still engaged in.
conversation. Occasionally, one-

cf the more thoughtful opera-
tors will interrupt a conversa-

tion, prior to disconnecting the

phone, and explain that the
phones are being shut off. For
the most part, however, this is

group to poll is the commuters, who vitally need a new Student Union and
have been stymied in their attempts, specifically through the Commuter

Students should also have a voice in deciding where the new Union
will be located. Dr. Kurtzman indicated that there is a possibility it will
be built around the current Union, which we feel is the best possible loca-
tion, since it is a central spot.‘ However, the Chancellor stressed that the
new buildings, which will be utilized by the time: the Student Union is
ready, could conceivably demand another site.

These ‘questions and the countless others that will arise during the
formative stages of our Union are ones that should be explored by the
faculty, students, and the administration, as we are all directly involved
with the various aspects of student life. Although students are not equip-
ped to handlethe technical aspect of the U-nion, we are in a position to make
our contribution to the development of our new Union.

We ask the administration to recognize the students when questions
arise as to the students’ needs. We are in a position to know.

not the case and particularly
when the call is long distance
(although rudeness is rudeness
whether long distance or local)
-this is an obnoxious procedure.

The exact reasoning for this
policy is still somewhat nebu-
lous in my mind. If the discon-
necting of the phones is a mat-
ter of consideration so that girls
will not be disturbed by the ring
after 11 p.m., then, why not al-

‘low those people already en-

gaged to ﬁnish their conversaa
tions.

The second, and equally seri-
ous of my complaints has to do
with the irresponsibility of -the
operators on duty. I personally
have been involved in two rather
unfortunate incidents of this
sort. The ﬁrst of these situa-
tions arose when I had an im-
portant long distance phone call
from a member of my family
after the traditional 11 p.m. clos-

ing of the phones. My party, af- 
ter a rather unnecessary argu-

ment, was put through only on
the condition that the operator
would listen in on the call. The
second incident to which I re-
fer occurred when I received a
call and_ the operator put through
another call on top of the ﬁrst
one, and proceeded to allow the
second party to listen in on the
conversation. Both cases are in-
excusable and it is time that
something was done about this
type of inconsideration.

Controversy Over Talk 1 l

“ BostonCo1lege

BOSTON, Mass. (CPS) —
A speech by New York birth
control and legalized abor-
tion advocate William Baird
has led to disciplinary action
against five editorial -board
-members of the. Boston College
Heights.

The journalists, who were de-
nied the use of the school’s au-
ditorium to present Baird, held
the event in the newspaper's of-
fice. A public address system
transmitted Baird’s message to

more than 500 students who"

linedthe hall outside the office.

Baird, who was arrested two
weeks ago when he distributed
birth control devices during a
Boston University speech, “fo-r-
feited his right to an appear-
ance” because of his earlier ac-
tions, according to Rev. George
L. Drury, director of the Jesuit
school’s student personal serv
ices. '

Massachusetts law provides
only a registered physician may
distribute birth control informa-
tion or devices, and that only
to married persons over 21 years
of age.

Drury said the school did not
object to Baird's subject, but
took issue with the manner of
his presentation. “The idea we
would be fearful of his ideas is
totally false,” the administrator
stated.

The Rechargeable

40C

The editors’ actions will be re-
viewed by the school’s conduct
committee. No date has yetbeen
set for a hearing.

Stated Drury, “I do believe a
private institution does have the
right to actually -set som-e limits
to the type of person, his char-
acter and sense of responsibil-~
ily” who is allowed to speak.

Drury said that the college
“must do this if it is going to
fulﬁll its educational function.
He said in an interview that
Boston College had never re-
fused a speaker with a “truly
academic and profession opin-
ion.” ~

The administrator denied try-
ing “to inhibit a free and open
expression of ideas.”

Mike Barton, news editor of
the Heights, said he believed the
school had no right to make val-
ue judgments on particular

speakers. ‘

Netm-enHostDiuquesne,
Hope to Square Record

by ART ROSENGARTEN

The tennis team hopes to even their season record at
3-3 when they face Duquesne this afternoon at the new
courts.

The netman started the season off very slowly, as they
dropped their first three matches. Coach Ben Pope attribut-
ed this slow start to the cold, rainy weather which limited prac-
tice to the squash courts and the inability of some of the players
to attend practices and meets due to otheroutside committments.

In this “game of nerve and constant pressure,” coach Pope is
pleased with the team's progress so far this season. The team
has shown marked improvement from their early matches and if
th-is trend continues, coach Pope feels that this will be a winning
season for the netmen.

.He describes the team as being very well-balanced. The most
dependable man on the team has been sophomore Tom Stromp in
the fourth singles spot. He is undefeated in the three matches that
he has played this season. '

Senior Bill Nichols is having a ﬁne season in the tough ﬁrst
singles spot, with a 4-1 record. Second single’s main, junior Bill
Goldstein has come ‘back strong with two consecutive victories
after losing his ﬁrst three matches.

Saturday, the netmen rolled up an 8-1 victory over New York's
Hiram College. The top three singles players, Nichols (6-0, 6-3),
Goldstein (6-3, 6-1_), and Bob Salembier (6-0, 6-4), scored easy vic-
tories over their opponents, as did number four and ﬁve men,
Stro-mp (6-2, 6-1) and Erik Lieberman (6-4, 6-1).

The only loss occurred when Wilder of Hiram defeated Elliot
Sainer in a hard-fought match, 6-4, 4-6, and 6-3. Led by the number
one team of Nichols and Goldstein, all of the doubles teams were
victorious.

According to coach Pope, today’-s match against Duquesne
promises to be a very -close and exciting one. “Duquesne seems to
play over their heads when they meet us. A victory in the intra-
city rivalry means a great deal to the success of their season.”

“Dismal Year” Tag Dropped

  Tourneys

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Sports Editor

It’s the same old story.

When the track team,
coached by Jim Banner, be-
gan the outdoor ‘season, the
outlook appeared bleak. It
was s-aid there was not enough
against too much, competition-
wise.

But after a dis-ast-rous opening
meet loss to Navy, 131-23, the
tracksters did more than just
break from the gate in both the
Bowling Green and the Penn Re-
lays. ‘

7 For the second straight year

in Philadelphia, Villanova dom-
inated the 73 year old tourna-
ment before a crowd of 34,982.
But on Penn’s new rubberized
track, the track team had sev-
eral bright spots.

The sprint medley relay team,
comprised of Roger Holly, Frank
Handleman, Chet WojciechoW-
ski, and Keith Stoeber, ﬁnished
13 seconds behind Tennesse’s
record breaking -time of 3:17.8.
The trackmen's 3:31 clocking
earned them ﬁfth place in the
consolation bracket.

Wayne Bodenheimer, grabbed
a sixth place in the consolation
javelin throw. In the Ohio tour-

“Spotlight” Tracksters-   

ney, however, Bodenheimer toss-
ed the javelin 209 feet, eight
inches, good for ﬁrst place.

And too, the sprint medley
relay team ran a “slow” 3:33
time to pace the Ohio ﬁeld._ Sev-
eral other trackmen placed with
second and thirds.

“They're becoming real good,
and getting better,” noted Ban-
ner’ after the Penn meet. “Ev-
cryone’s improved. But you got-
ta have the horses in that Phil-
ly meet.

“Right now, although we're
shooting for the IC4A’s (May

27), we’re not making any de- '

cisions on crucial meets,” Ban-
ner said. “We'll just play them
one at a time.”

WASHINGTON, D. C. (CPC)
—The Commission on Federal
Relations of the American Coun-

cil on Education has urged th-at '

graduate and graduate leve ,”

be continued.

The Commission’s recommen-
dation was based “not for the
sake of the individuals concern-
ed, but for the national interest:
the needs of the civil-ian econo-_
my, the backup of our military

. effort, and production of highly

trained manpower for the mili-

Deferments

If all forms of deferment are
abandoned, however, the Com-
mission endorsed a draft by ran-
dom selection of the youngest
men, at age 19 or on completion
of high school, whichever comes
earlier. Students in college would
be added to the 19-year-old pool
upon completion of college, ac-
cording to the Commission's
plan. _

the report stated, “the -adoption
of a system that was not suffi-
ciently ﬂexible to adjust _to un-
foreseen circumstances.”

straight hair tell me I'm lucky to have natural curl.
They just don't know! I leave the house with smooth
hair...and get back home looking like curlylocks. In
the winter itsnows and—instant ringlets. And summer
humidity‘ makes my hair frizz up and go wild.

"I saw an ad for CURL FREE in a magazine. It said, ‘I
was a curly-headed baby, but baby look at me now!’
The results looked marvelous. I would like to try it.”
