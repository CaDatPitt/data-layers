I Mixing reminiscences of thedays
when he worked on newspapers, as
reporter and as editor, with a dis-
cussion of the Cathedral of Learn-

spoke at the Febru_ary dinner _of the
Pittsburgh Alumni Chapter of "Sigma

<-n the program of the new building.
taking up ‘the matter of faculty and-
student body. The plan presented
for development; in the matter of in-
struction was st,artli_-ng in its thor-
oughness. The_ building was de-
signed so that it might bring forth
the best in each student and that it
mightserve as an inspiration for
all students, he said. ' '
T. R. Williams, business manager
of ; the Pittsburgh Press, spoke on
the position Pittsburgh has held in
the eyes of the world. In -tracing
this ‘position, Mr, Wiliiams said that
a while back,*the' city was known for
its rich and reckless young million-~_
aires, then for its steel, and now
thanks to the Cathedral of Learning,
for its appreciation of educational
movements. . ‘ g
Cy .Hu'ng,erford, cartoonist for the
Pittsburgh Sun, ‘in’ commenting upon-
the“ wide spread publicity Pitt.sbur.gh'
has received from the proposed.
building, stated that while on a tour

. through Canada, he saw a picture of

Pitt's 52~story building in an edition
of the London Graphic._ M -
Charles Lewis, editorial writer of
the Pittsburgh Sun, in a short iI1f0I'1
mal talk, stressed the point that it
is not so much the mechanics of
journalism that .the,journalists shou d
acquire in college, but rather ‘t e
broad, fundamental principles of edu-
cation. - . ’
George Stall, secretary -of the
Pittsburgh Publishers Association.
spoke bi-ieﬂyof his” career in’ the
newspaper world. He: mentioned
Pitt's possibilities in inﬂuencing

Pitt Astronomer, Will See
Next Eclipse‘ in East .I1idies

 

Dr. I-Ieber'D. Curtis, director of the

, Allegheny Observatory of 'tl1e'Uni-

versity,-is preparing for the next total
eclipse of ‘the sun, which will take
him Soutlrto the, equator and half
way around the globe. The eclipse is
scheduled to appear in Sumatra in
the East Indies, January*‘14, 1926. I
Dr. Curtis will, probably, make the’
trip with Prof. John A. Miller_ of
Swarthmore College, -with whom he
worked- at New Haven, Conn., at the
last total“ eclipse in January. .

In order to reach Sumatra in‘ time
for the phenomenon the-. party will-
start from Pittsburgh sometime in
October. They will travel by .._way of
San Francisco, I-Iongkong, Manila and
-Singapore. The trip. will take more
than a month and another month will

‘be necessary -to set up instruments‘

and _ to get acclimated.» The eclipse.
will last three and one-half’ minutes,
giving the astronomers about twice
the time they had for observation at
New , Haven during ‘ the January
eclipse. . ‘ f ‘

This eclipse will be the eighth total
one visited by Dr. Curtis. , In addition
to his previous visit ._' ‘to the South’
Paciﬁc he has journeyed to Kiev,
Russia, Labrador, «Me-xico,V Georgia,
‘Connecticut and Washington, all for
a few minutes of daytime darl_:nes's._ -

“Why does a spherical bit of homo-

that it eventually. becomes an animal
with tissues that are highly special-
ized‘ and totally unlike?” _ _ I

It is an ‘age old question that has
not .been solved. Dr. H. H. Collins

“There is a great gapbetween the

The Blue and Gold Freshmen Swim-
mers, last Friday, beat the Greens-
Vburg‘.“Y” team, 31-30. The Pitt team.
with but four racers present besides
the plungers, fought against big odds
all the way, and did not cinch victory
until the ﬁnal‘ event———th,e 100-yard,
free-style, was won by Seeley, while
London took third, Before this event
began the score was 27-25 in honor
’ Pitt took
ﬁve out of ‘seven ﬁrsts, but lack 01’
men almost proved their undoing, the
Greensbulrgex-s taking a goodly share
of the seconds and thirds.

Ray started’ the Pittites on their
drive for another victory, when he
beat Lemmon of the “Y" in’ the
plunge, Facius taking third and mak-
ing the score 6-3 Pitt. Ray and Facius
have both been‘ doing fine work this
season, and have yet to see an op-
ponent cop the plunge. V
«The Greensburg crew came back
