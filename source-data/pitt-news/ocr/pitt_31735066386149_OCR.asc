Yolanda King spoke in the William Pitt Union last night.

King says education
key to end of racism

By Scot Ross
Editor in Chief

Although he made countless pleas for racial equality, Martin
Luther King Jr.’s most famous oratory came in 1963 when he told
a Washington, D.C. crowd that he had a dream that one day all
little black boys and girls could join hands together with all little
white boys and girls.

Over a quarter—century later, his youngest daughter Yolanda,
who spoke last night at Pitt, stressed the importance of education
and awareness on college campuses if this dream is to finally
become a reality. ii»

King's appearance was part of the Celebrate Diversity festival.
Stressing multi-cultural understanding, she said, “We must [reject]
our apathies and get back to the task at hand. We have
opportunities every day to make a difference. Here on this
campus, we can find the time and the place, and we must seize
the opportunities.”

Being informed about racism —— overt, inward and personal ——
is an important step, King said. Understanding and confronting
racial divisions can bring about a desired end. “There are all
kinds of prejudices we're not even conscious of. They have been
passed on to us. When we are willing to look at [this] honestly [we
can] do something about it.”

“In universities, [...] we need to find a society where people
can come together respecting their differences, appreciating
their commonalities,” she said. “Each and every university in this
country should institute a course that’s a required part of the
curriculum in the ethnic studies. You can call it ‘Multi-cultural
Dynamics.”’

“But if indeed we are going to go past ignorance and the fear
that results, we are going to have to have structured ways to do
[this] It's not just going to happen,” said King.

Adding that people were not just going to be “transformed,”
King said it is important to keep pressing the issue, to “jam it
down their throats” to end racial injustices.

As one facet of Pitt's rnulti-cultural awareness week, university
ofﬁcials are hoping that speakers like King can not only help to
bring these issues to light but also work to promote racial and
ethnic harmony on campus.

Joe Cavalla, student activities director, said, “I think that [an]
individual can give his or her perpective [to the Cultural Diversity
program], especially if this is an area that she or he was brought
up in and lived through. In the case of Yolanda King [...]her
whole life [has been inﬂuenced by] her father. Now she’s an
individual on her own way. She is not her dad; she’s not her mom
[Coretta Scott King], and she’s got her own message.”

Dr. William Harmon, vice president of StudentAffairs said, “It’s

The opening ceremonies for the
week-long Celebrate Diversity
program were opened yesterday
by Geoffrey Wood, director of
the Office of International
Services.

“These ceremonies [consist of]
five days of activities designed to
celebrate and demonstrate the
variety of cultures represented in
the university community,” he
said.

Wood ‘ introduced Associate
Provost Jack Daniel, Ph.D., who

spoke on diversity in terms of the
Middle East crisis.

“Today’s world focus on Iraq,
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait merely
underscores the reality that if we
have a fundamental problem in
one part of the world, [...] we have
a fundamental problem in all parts
of the world,” Daniel said.

“While much of the media
coverage has focused on [...] oil

and money, guns and other .

technological aspects of war, it
should be noted that we will never
resolve [.. .] the fundamental issues
there until we also address issues
that relate to such things as

Judaism, Islam and Christianity

said.

“Regardless of whatever

military and economic [victories '

we] might achieve, we will never
have peace in that region until we
understand the people, the

languages, the religions and the

rest of the cultures of what we call
the Middle East,” he said.

“On the domestic side, all of us
must understand what some have
been calling the ‘browning’ of
America. Across the United States,

Campus torn by rapist's sentence

By Jason Hillman
T be Pitt News

The capture and trial of Antoine
Hamilton, the 16-year-old
convicted of two rapes in
Oakland, has caused concern
among students and faculty at the
University of Pittsburgh.

Hamilton was sentenced
yesterday to four years in the sex-
offender program at Shuman
Center. His trial in a juvenile court
has sparked controversy about

juvenile criminals and rape as a

crime.

“I think it’s good that [Hamilton]
pleaded guilty, and people can
now walkthe streets safely,” said

/ junior Julie Kaufmann.

“[Hamilton’s conviction] was
horrible,” said junior Carol Mayer.
“I can’t believe he was tried as a
juvenile. He only got four years
— it’s amazing. What happened
to our criminal-justice system?”

“I think it’s great that he got
convicted,” freshman Jason
Walder said. “But I wouldn’t be
surprised if there were other
incidents in the future?’

“If he really did it, I think it’s sad
that whatever is wrong with him
[led him] to attack women,” said

C/oargesfilea’ in Fifth Ave. accident

By Jim_Wechsler
stag" Writer

Charges have been brought
against the driver of a blue
Chevrolet that allegedly caused a
two—car collision at the corner of
Fifth and Bellefield Avenues on
Sept. 4, leaving eight people
hospitalized.

Joseph Goodwin, 57, was
charged with aggravated assault,
reckless driving, and driving too
fast for conditions. A breathalyzer
detected alcohol on his breath,
and a blood sample was taken,
according to Police Lt. Richard
Dwyer, night supervisor ‘of
detectives for the city of
Pittsburgh. Dwyer said that a
drunken-driving charge may be

added, pending the results of the
blood test. If convicted, Goodwin
could face up to 10 years in jail.
Glenn Hardy, the reporting officer
at the scene, said,”I am confident
that he will be charged [with
drunken driving].”

Goodwin was released from
Mercy Hospital on Sept. 5. An
early speculation that he had
suffered a slight heart attack
before the accident occurred has
been disregarded. Hardy called
the suspicion “a rumor” and said
he believed that “[passengers in
Goodwin’s Chevy] started it
among themselves.”

Kokakyo Yoshida, the Pitt
graduate student injured in the
accident,’ remains in critical
condition at Presbyterian-

University Hospital.

Dwyer explained Yoshida’s
injuries: “I believe that part of
[her] pelvis was crushed.” Dwyer
said that both of Yoshida’s legs
had to be amputated; one was
amputated at the scene of the
accident. Yoshida sustained head
injuries and multiple trauma in
the accident as well.

Keith Stonebraker, building
manager of Webster Hall, where
Yoshida resided, has set up a fund
to aid in defraying the medical-
care equipment and hospital
costs.

Donations can be sent to the
Kayo Yoshida Fund at this

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, September 13, 1990

New VP brings experience, innovation

By Leon Fuksman
For The Pitt News-

Starting a newjob often involves
making new friends and adapting
to various tasks and
responsiblities, but for Edward
Hunia, the new vice president of
finance, none of these challenges
are a problem.

While spending 17 years at
Carnegie Mellon University as the
assistant to the treasurer, Hunia
became acquainted with Pitt’s
finance system and its employees.

“With all those years of higher-
education experience in finance,
I have become good at what I
do,” Hunia, who replaced 25-year
veteran Joseph Dutton on Aug.
20, said.

Hunia said he will try to combat
unpopular tuition increases by
asking the federal and state
governments for financial aid.

“My goal is to review the total
financial operations and try to
squeeze the most out of every
dollar,” he said.

Another way to increase the
university’s revenue is to
accelerate the procedure of
depositing checks into an account
in order to invest the money into
stocks, bonds, real estate and
other projects, according to
Hunia.

While working at CMU, Hunia
was known for his innovative
work with investing and is
credited with investing in high-
technology companies, according
to Angel Jordan, CMU provost
and vice—chairperson of Mellon
Pittsburgh Carnegie Corporation.

“He did an excellent job
investing the short—term funds so
that we were able to maintain a
position as to where [CMU] earned
it’s money,” said Richard Cyert,
president of the Carnegie Bosch
Institute of international
management and former
president of CMU.

Pitt President Wesley Posvar
agreed.

THE PIT!’ NEWS, Thursday, September 13, 1990,

g Pitt group lives in the past

By Andrea Barczykowski
Staff Writer

For most people, the Middle
Ages is only a memory from their
high-school history class, but for
the members of the Society for
Creative Anachronism, the Middle
Ages is still a way of life.

According to Jacqueline F.
Whitney, adviser of the
organization and a member of the
University of Pittsburgh’s
University . Challenge for
Excellence Program, the Society
for Creative Anachronism is “kind
of all things to all people, but
speciﬁcally, it’s a re—enactrnent of
the Middle Ages.”

The president of the Pitt chapter,
Pam Bolkovac, explains that the
group does not explore all aspects
of the Middle Ages.

“We are recreating the Middle
Ages the ‘way it should have been,
not the way it was.”

Problems such as the bubonic
plague, war and class struggle are
not included in the representation
of this time period. Instead,
members choose a particular area
of interest such as fighting,
dancing, artwork or
craftsmanship.

The organization holds events
approximately every month.
Embroidery, jewelry,

leatherwork, woodwork and

other art forms are displayed. A
fighting tourney is held, in which
real armor and fake weapons are
used. '

Center. From bold colors and sophisticated profiles in frames to Extended

“The idea is to out-finesse your
opponent, not to hurt him,”
Bolkovac said.

Although these fights are often
what people associate with the
society, they are only a small part
of what it does.

Bolkovac said, “The fighting is
the most visible aspect, but less
than 20 percent of the SCA
[members] fight.”

Both men and women
participate in the fighting.

Following the fights, there is a
three—course feast in which “every
course is a meal in itself,”
according to Bolkovac. Dancing
to live music, socializing, and
sometimes viewing a play are part
of the evening events.

Bolkovac described the events
as “a day of revelry spent with
good friends. There is something
for everyone to do no matter
where your interests are.”

Although research is involved,
the most important aspect of the
group is its moral code.

“The SCA is based on chivalry
and’ honor. Those are the only
things that really matter,”
Bolkovac said.

When a member becomes more
advanced in the group, so does
the research. A member chooses
a particular time period and
creates a persona. This persona
takes a long time to develop and
can always be expanded.

“The whole persona build-up
takes years. I've been in the group
for four years, and I’ve hardly

started,” said Bolkovac.
A wide variety of people belong

. to the society for many reasons.

“There’s a lot of research, if
that’s what you want to do. Some
people start from the theater, and
a few people are genuine artists
in the real world,” said Whitney.

She also realizes that some
“people are attracted by the idea
that‘it’s different, so they think
they’re playing {Dungeons and
Dragonsl.”

Although the members who
belong to the group have a variety
of careers and majors, they have
one thing in common.

“It's a very good’ place to meet
people because the SCA will not
judge you because of anything
you’ve done before you walk
through the door. If you walk into
your first meeting with a blank
look on your face, 15 people will
immediately come up to you and
introduce themselves,” Bolkovac
said.

The SCA originated 25 years
ago-in California. The national
society is comprised of 13
kingdoms, which are broken
down into ‘subsets. Pitt and
Carnegie Mellon University are a
joint chapter of the Pittsburgh
Kingdom.

About 15 members are active in
the Pitt chapter, and there are 20
participants in the CMU chapter.
There are 250 members in the
Pittsburgh Kingdom and 30,000
nationally.

women’s studies at Pitt, believes otherwise.

"1 believe there is a legitimate legal distinction made between
adults and children,” she said.

' However, Hansen was not completely satisfied‘ with the way
the justice system handled this case. “I think [the case] illustrates
that our society does not know what to do with [l6—year—olds].
They’re too old for compensatory education; they’re too old to
give up on.”

“I’m not in any way condoning or excusing what [Hamilton]
did,” said Marta Effinger, Black Action Society deputy
chairperson. “ButI don’t think that that sending him to prison is
necessarily the answer either. You have to look at his background
and maybe see what kind of problems he has. We have to take
this as a community problem, not just his problem.

“The entire community has to be involved in helping protect
the women because we are part of the community. You can’t
expect one group to do the job. So, as far as Pitt is concerned,
whether we live on or off campus, Pitt needs to do more to boost
up safety for women of all colors. 5

“Other things need to be done besides locking up people and
throwing away the key,” said Effinger.

Helsel, however, was angry that the sentence was only four
years. The district attorney’s office, as quoted inJ77eP1'ttsbmgb
Press, said that the four-year sentence was.“consistent” with the
probable penalty given in an adult trial.

“You get more [time] for robbing a bank then you do for raping
a woman,” Helsel said. ‘‘I think that is a really powerful statement
about the value that’s placed on women having autonomy over
their own bodies.” 5

A distinguished record at CMU,” he said.

Some of Hunia’s other duties include administering Pitt’s
stocks and bonds, managing the funds and property donated to

the university and serving as chairperson of the non—profit MPC

Corporation responsible for joint activities between Pitt and
CMU.

“He is an excellent professional who takes transactions of any
kind very seriously, “ Jordan said.

Before CMU hired Hunia in 1973, he worked five years as a
mechanical engineer for the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Corporation
until he realized that “engineering wasn’t my lifelong ambition.”

He received bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mechanical
engineering from CMU and a master's degree in business at Pitt.

“It’s very exciting being at Pitt,” Hunia said.

“Pitt’s a larger [institution than CMU], which will make the job
more interesting but yet more challenging,” he said.

Colleagues at CMU are not worried about Hunia’s competency
in his new job. “Pitt made an excellent choice by selecting
him,” Jordan said. _

“He is extremely loyal to people and very nice to have as a
friend.”

Cyert said Pitt is fortunate to have Hunia.

“He will probably be the best chief financial official Pitt ever
had,” he said.

which our public schools, our

increasingly made up of African,

Americans,” he said.

“Diversity for me is much more
than something to celebrate.
Diversity is something that
deserves to be at the forefront of
our national agenda,” he said.

Burkart Holzner, Ph.D., director
of the University Center for
International Studies, said, “The
university is a wonderful place to
experience and to study cultural
diversity. But we have to
remember that all over the world
and in our own city, cultural
diversity often leads to conﬂict

-and bitter energy, to inequality

and discrimination," he said.
“Therefore, an occasion as

festive as this one ought to present
an intellectual challenge to work
toward the establishment of
institutions that will lead to a
peaceful world in which cultural
diversity can be accomplished in
harmony and can reach its highest

fruition,” he said. “A university
has the task of being the spearhead
in this endeavor.” V

Natalie Freely, a student
representative of the committee
that planned Celebrate Diversity,
said, “It’s very important to learn
as much as we can during these
five days but not just learn it and
[forget it] when it ends on Sunday
[...], but hopefully to carry on some
of that knowledge to bring
together all the people in different
groups,” she said.

The program’s international
displays and food festival had to
be moved indoors from the
Bigelow porch to Room M—-18 of
the William Pitt Union because of
the weather.

Sandria Caines, who sold
“artifacts from all over the

spite of the rain, the festival was
better than last year’s. '

Caines said that many people

“When we came inside from

said Heather Neill of the Slavic

Stacey Coughenour said the rain
hurt the Slavic Club’s sales “a little,
because it was more of an
inconvenience to walk through

Connie Acosta of the Center for

program was excellent. “We’ve
been able to give out information
about our program and let people
know that we’re available, that

some people away. “I didn’t see

Sept. 11 — A woman alerted
police to a suspicious man
wearing a red plaid shirt and dark
pants who followed her from the
front of Clapp Hall to Lytton Street.
He tried to get her attention by
saying, “Hey, lady,” but the
woman told him, “Leave me
alone.” She and an officer looked
for the man, but could not find
him. The woman said that she
sees the man about every other
day on the same block between
8:15 and 8:30 a.m., and has seen
him approach other women.

Sept.12 —— Campus police,

received a call from two residents
of Tower A who had received an
off-campus phone call from

someone who claimed to be

Bryan Jacobs from campus

security. The caller said that he
received several noise complaints

about this room, and told the
residents to meet them in the
lobby in five minutes. Before

going to meet this person, the
residents called campus police,

and an officer told them that if a
complaint was filed about noise,

a campus police officer or a
resident assistant would come

directly to the room. The officer
advised the residents to keep a
log of the time the calls were
received and to report any
persisting calls to the police.

The final step has been taken for a major power to burst J    

back onto the world scene. .

Yesterday, the foreign ministers of the United States,
Great Britain, France and the Soviet Union, along with
delegates from East and West Germany, signed a treaty
sanctioning the reunification of Germany.

Germany was originally separated in 1945 at the end of
World War 11. At that time, the four powers divided the city
of Berlin, each partitioning off their own quadrants of that
historic city. I

With this agreement, East and West Germany will
reunite. Berlin will finally return to a city under one rule.

But this treaty, called the two—plus-four agreement, has
some stipulations. The Soviet Union has demanded that
built-in limit_s be imposed upon the German military.
Germany also cannot regain territory forfeited to Poland
after the war.

The Soviet Union, after much debate, will withdraw by
1994 all of its troops remaining in East Germany. These
sanctions prohibit the creation of an army to take their
place. A _

Even though Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has
spent his time in office attempting to change the Soviet
Union with economic reforms, he still holds some
reservations against the Western democracies. His country
has implicitly stated these reservations by demanding this
military stipulation.

This agreement was in jeopardy only hours before it was
signed. The Soviets had been arguing over a planned
military exercise "by NATO forces in what is now East
Germany after the Soviet pullout. Fortunately the situation
was resolved, and the treaty was signed.

In 1992, Europe will become one large economic ,

community. All economic barriers will be dropped.
However, this does not mean that it will also become one
diplomatic or military power as well. Therefore, Soviet
fears of a powerful European army rising against them are
unfounded.

According to East German Prime Minister Lothar de
Maiziere, “This treaty marks the end of the Cold War era.”
The Soviets, however, have a different perspective. By
enforcing these unfair sanctions, they are showing a clear
sign of of the continuing distrust that typified the Cold
War.

On Oct. 3, East and West Germany will reunite, less than
one year after the fall of the Berlin Wall. But Germany will
always be susceptible to foreign pressure, thanks largely
in part to the sanctions unfairly imposed by the four great
powers.

As a perspective writer for The
Pitt News, I have witnessed a lot
of stressful, striking and even just
strange things on and around the
Pitt campus. On Tuesday, I finally

got the dubious honor of
reporting a hard-news story. I
hadn’t planned on it. I was just
the right guy in the right place at
the right time. So I covered the
story. It was about an automobile
accident on Fifth and Bellefield
Avenues. .
When I initially heard about
the story, I was perusing The
Pittsburgh Press looking for a
good subject for a column. (That’s
how most of my articles come
about. I stopped watching
television when Connie Chung
went off the air.) Somebody threw
me a notebook and said, “Cover
it.” I did not know what I was
doing, nor what to expect. But I
am a budding journalist, and I
figured that I've got to learn
sometime. (Actually, I was pretty
excited about the whole thing:
two cameramen and_ myself
barrelling up Fifth Avenue in
search of. a piece of history.
Channel 11 News was also there.)
Professionals. I wondered how
they had gotten to the scene so
quickly. But not for long. There
was the accident, and it was time

to be a reporter.

I cannot recall a time when I
had as much difficulty performing
a task as I had that evening. The
paramedics had arrived, but not

everyone had been taken to the
hospital yet. I saw firsthand the
horrible results of that unfortunate
accident. I saw the pain and the

Wechsler

sorrow. And the blood. Oh, God,
the blood! I felt sick, both from
the nausea swelling up in my
throat and from the thought of all
those people standing around
gawking. It seemed so insensitive.
Bestial. . -

It got worse. I had to talk to the
victims as they were being
bandaged and secured. I was
trying to get an accurate
description of the accident and
maybe a good quote or two. The
police began roping off the area.
I moved into the crowd. Get the
crowd's reaction, yeah. Get some
human interest in the story. I felt
like a vulture preying on the
misfortunes of the suffering. I kept
telling myself that if I didn’t get all

I gathered what facts I could, and
I hurried back to the news room,
more to get away from the
accident than to get to anyplace. I
made the necessary phone calls
and confirmed the details. Iwrote
the story.

I knew I would be up studying,

to lose my humanity and become

I wish every reporter would get

censorship

violence is a crime. A few years

this law for publishing anti—Semitic

not harmed freedom in France.

On the contrary, it protects the

freedom of racial minorities.

Mr. Azinger says that people

are intelligent enough to make
their choices. He is wrong. Vast
numbers of people are so stupid
that they will believe any idea if
they hear it often enough and if it
doesn’t directly hurt them.

Centuries of racism and sexism

Panthers to face first real test this «Saturday

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

On paper there are plenty of reasons
’why Pitt vs. Oklahoma will be such a big
game.

First off, the Panthers are ranked 13th in
the Associated Press poll, while the Sooners
stand at No. 14. Enough said there.

Second, this will be Hackett’s first real
test this season against a nationally ranked
team. Although Hackett was most
displeased with his sputtering offense
against the Boston College Eagles last
week, he was quite impressed with the
defensive effort. Pitt has had two games to
“get its feet wet” and now that the Panthers

even scale.

Third, although Hackett has plenty of
coaching experience under his belt (three
NFL teams from 1981 through 1988,
assistant coach at California from 1972
through 1975 and Southern Cal from 1976
through 1980), he is a relative newcomer
to the modern college football scene. Prior
to being named head ‘coach last season, he
was Pitt’s offensive coordinator in 1989.

In contrast, Sooner coach Gary Gibbs
has been on the OU coaching staff for 15
seasons. He is in his second year as head
coach after replacing Barry Switzer on
June 21, 1989. Gibbs has been living and
breathing the Oklahoma system for quite
a while, for he was a former linebacker on
Oklahoma’s 1974 national championship

again. Pitt’s last visit to Oklahoma (1975)
resulted in a 46-10 loss in which Tony
Dorsett was held to a mere 17 yards rushing
on 12 carries —— the lowest rushing output
in his entire career at Pitt. The 36-point
deficit was the largest Pitt sustained during
the Johnny Majors era.

The last time the Panthers took on the
Sooners at Pitt Stadium (1984), the result
was much the same. Oklahoma limited Pitt
to just 32 yards rushing and 249 yards in
total offense in a 42-10 Sooner win.

“We are very impressed with their victory
over UCLA. They were overpowering,
overwhelming’ at times tremendous
strength and speed. This is an outstanding‘
offensive football team; very big up front,
and it’s a great test for us,” Hackett said.

formation includes an additional receiver

in the backfield who is a ﬂanker but also an
excellent runner. A hybrid known as a “Z-
back,” if you will. This extra back moves
across the I—formation and sets in it. In
short, the Colorado Buffaloes’ offense that
was so successful last season. _

Fullback Kenyon Rasheed and tailback
Dewell Brewer will anchor the I-formation,
while Z—backs Ted Long and Otis Taylor
will be alternating third men in the power-
I.

“These men are speed, option, wishbone
[offense] people. Oklahoma recruited that
way; they’ve played it all their lives; they
run on a field which has a huge hill in the
middle. That [offense] is tailor—made for
them,” Hackett added.

for bragging rights —
showdown in Okla.

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

Top 20 rankings. Bah!

East vs. West. Pshaw!

National television. Uh-uh!

What’s the most important thing
up for grabs at this Saturday's Pitt-
Oklahoma game to Curvin
Richards?

Why, neighborhood bragging
rights, of course. A

No, really. Richards grew up in
LaPorte, Tex. with Sooners’ Z-
back/split end,Otis Taylor, and
the two have waited three years
to play this game.

It’s a big deal to those two, but
others have also felt the
hometown pressure to win. Just
ask Ronald Redmon.

Redmon, a Miami, Fla. native,
is good friends with several
members of the Miami Hurricane
team from his days at Miami’s
Northwestern High. When the
‘Canes came to town last year,
Redmon said that if Pitt lost, he’d
never hear the end of it.

Unfortunately for the Panther
fullback, Miami won that game
24-3. Did he hear about the loss

, the next time he went" home?

“Oh, yeah. I heard about it.
From the time I stepped off the
plane, until the time I came back
to Pitt. They wouldn’t let me forget
about it,” said Redmon.

We’re talking serious rivalry
here.

And Curvin Richards will be in
much the same situation this
Saturday. Although the LaPorte
Bulldogs play approximately 450
miles from Norman, Okla., this is
almost a homecoming for the
Panther tailback. In addition to
Taylor, the Sooners have 42 other
down—home Texas boys on the
team.

“When we were seniors in high
school, we knew that he was
going to Oklahoma and I was
coming to Pitt, and we looked at

the schedule and saw that we
would meet in 1990,” said
Richards. “Now when I go back to
LaPorte, [one of us] will have the
right to brag. I told [him] that when
we played, we would beat him by
three touchdowns.”

That’s about 26 points less than
what the actual line is (Oklahoma
by five), but Richards doesn’t want
to take back the promise he made
four years ago.

“No, I think it would be neat to
beat them by three touchdowns,”
said Richards, smiling.

And what does Taylor have to
say about all this?

“I better take the “no comment”
rule on that one," laughed Taylor.
“No, seriously, tell him that I wish
him all the best and that I look
forward to seeing him when he
gets out here. 0

“It was a little, fun thing that we
did,” said Taylor. “We used to
tease each other about it, but now
that it’s here, yeah, it’s" grown a
little more serious.”

“We’ve known each other since
Little League. I lived five minutes
from his grandmother and 10
minutes from his mother,” said
Richards. “And he was always my
quarterback in high school."

But now he’s a Sooner, and
Richards is a Panther.

After the Boston College game,
Richards was disappointed with
his performance but seemed to
cheer up after he was asked about
this week’s contest. He was also
the first Panther to emerge from
the locker room clad in the now
famous ,“BEAT OKLAHOMA” T-
shirt.

“I'm looking at this as a personal
challenge between him and
myself," said Richards.

He hasn't been back to LaPorte
in a year and a half (he now lives
in Minnesota), but Richards has
already made plans to see Taylor
once the Panthers arrive in

now has the Pitt—BC game ball,
voted a unanimous recipient by

the Panther coaches.

What do his teammates think
of Carl Hagins? A lot.

“I don’t think you could say
enough nice things about Carl.
Nobody deserves as much credit
‘as he does; his work ethic is
unreal,” said tight end Eric
Seaman. “He is the consummate
team player. I’ll tell you, if there
was a team in the country that
had 22 Carl Haginses, they would
be untouchable. Come to think
of it, they would be downright
scary.

“He is such a great guy and
such a great team player. He is
what Pitt football is all about.”

That good? Scott Miller, Pitt’s
starting offensive right tackle said
about Hagins, “I was really
impressed with the way he
played; he made some great
blocks for Curvin [Richards] and
Glenn [Deveauxl, and he caught
the ball in some critical moments
of the game, which [kept] the BC
tacklers from keying on Curvin.”

Hagins is close to his family.
The first people he called when
he received word that he would
play were his parents. He told
them, “I think I’m going to play
this weekend, but I don’t know
how much.” It’s a good thing his
parents live in the Boston area,
because they were afforded the
opportunity to see their son play

the majority of the game. They
will get another chance on
Saturday; this time he’ll show off
his wares on national television.

Growing up, his idol was his
older brother, a star athlete at the
high school Carl would later earn
a combined 12 varsity letters at in
football, baseball and track. He
also admired former Panther and
Heisman Trophy winner Tony
Dorsett. However, with the body
Hagins has, as well as the position
he plays, he found a new idol, Bo
Jackson.

What does Carl Hagins dream
about now that he has started a
big-time college football game?

How about taking a hand-off
from -Alex Van Pelt, sweeping
outside, knocking an Oklahoma
linebacker ﬂat on his keister (too
bad Brian Bosworth isn’t still in
the Oklahoma crimson and
cream), and racing 65 yards for
the game winning touchdown?

“Oh man, that would be the
greatest. But to tell you the truth,
just beating them would be
sufficient enough for me,” Hagins
replied, smiling, and his eyes lit
up.

It’s going to take an all-out team
effort and hard work for the
Panthers to bring back a victory
from Oklahoma. If anybody on
the Pitt team has any questions
about what those words really
mean, they can look for No. 38,
and he’ll be gladto tell you.

OU

Taylor is a redshirt sophomore
at OU and is listed second on the
depth chart at Z—back (a third
player in the backﬁeld of the
Sooners’ Option—I offense). He
also returns kicks and punts for
the team, returning three punts
for a 73-yard average and one
kick for 36 yards in the Sooners’
34-14 victory over UCLA last
week.

Taylor also caught one pass for
12 yards in the game, which was
viewed by several Panthers in the
team’s lounge, including
Richards.

“Otis had a beautiful return
[against UCLA],” said Pitt coach
Paul Hackett. “Curvin was on the
edge of his seat on that one.

Entering the game, Richards
ranks 12th in the nation in rushing
(118 yards per game), but he’ll
have his work cut out for him if he
wants to impress his old friend on
Saturday. The Sooners held UCLA
to 28 yards rushing on 27 carries
in the team’s opener and are
known to stuff running backs

better than Julia Child can stuff a

turkey on Thanksgiving morning.
“We can’t play against
Oklahoma the way we played

against Boston College," said _

Richards. “[Oklahoma has] one of
the best defenses in the country.
I’ll just try to react to what the
defense does and try to get into
an open area.”

Hackett has been using Darnell

Dickerson at quarterback to

_represent Sooner ﬁeld general

Steve Collins. Also, walk—on
former wrestler Joe Conlon has
been moved to fullback with
reserve Danny Boyd, and
Jermaine and Kevin Williams have
been going through the motions
at tailback.

Also, Pitt Stadium loudspeakers
have been blaring with crowd
noise during practice sessions to
represent the 75,004 that will be
on hand this Saturday.

Teams that have been formerly
successful against Oklahoma have
tended to go to the pass. Most
notably, the Miami Hurricanes
have beaten the Sooners three
straight times, in 1985, 1986 and

1988 in the Orange‘ Bowl. But

Hackett is initially planning on
aborting a primary passing game.

“I think if you take that approach

with their speed and quickness,

you’re going to fall right into their

hands. They don’t give you

anything deep; they play it fairly

conservative, and then they attack
the football,” Hackett said.

“If they know you’re going to

pass, they’re probably as good a
passing defense as there is. They

key to this game is going to be the

Billy Bragg

, By Cheryl Neidlinger

For The Pitt News

His first European tour
beneﬁted striking British miners.
A year later, he went on another
tour, the British Labor Party’s “Jobs
For Youth“ tour. In 1988, he
recorded a single that raised
almost half a million pounds for
Childline, a crisis line for victims

_ of child abuse.

His music and his politics have
taken him to Nicaragua, the Soviet
Union and Berlin.

His latest album has caused
quite a stir among musical and
political figures all over the world.
When he sang a song from this
album on the steps of the Capitol

on Earth Day, The Washington I

Postcalled him a “communist.” In
a time when artists with a cause
are a dime a dozen, Bragg stands
out, not only because he chooses
to speak out, but also because he
places himself right in the middle
of each of the issues. That kind of
commitment is what Billy Bragg
prides himself on.

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1990

Born in a suburb of London and
raised by working—class parents,
Bragg quickly became aware that
life was offering him limited
options. His musical interest
began “shortly after being taken
to the Ford Motor Company’s main
body plant in Dagenham and
being told that this was where I
was going to work.” B i l l y
decided that he had better become
“either a soccer player or a
musiCian,” the traditional escapes
of the working—class youth. Bands
like the Clash and thejam, as well
as the songwriting of Elvis
Costello, all inﬂuenced Riff Raff,
his first band, described by Bragg
as a four—year project that
produced “about seven obscure
singles.”

After the project failed, Bragg
decided to do it alone, playing for
anyone who would listen. His first
big break came in 1985, when his
first album, comprised of live
recordings intended to be used as
demos, hit the British Top 50, and
Bragg began his first European
tour. The tour was a success, and
Bragg soon found himself touring
with the likes of Echo & The

Bunnymen, “who sat me in the

back of the bus and taught me a
lot about touring,” and The Smiths.
Since 1983 Billy Bragg can be
credited with a list of live and
studio albums, as well as an

equally long list of causes and

beneﬁts he has chosen to support.
The latest album in the Billy
Bragg collection is a project called

Thelntemationale, subtitled “La
Lucha Continua” (“The Struggle
Continues”). “ The Internationale
is not the next Billy Bra gg album, ”
he proclaims. Instead, “it’s a
project I’ve wanted to do for
awhile.” Previous albums have
been collections of self—penned
Bragg material drawing attention
to his own political/personal
viewpoints, but The
Internationale is different.

It is described by Bragg as a
landmark collection of
liberationist songs honoring
heroes and freedom fighters of
many generations from all over
the world. Billy decided that he
wanted to give new life to this
200-year collection of political
anthems. Included are songs like
“Blake’s Jerusalem,” a William
Blake poem set to music by Hubert
Parry; a popular song in England
known by every British school

' boy, “My Youngest Son Came
Home Today,” a song about the
war in Ireland; and the title «song,
“The Internationale,” performed
by Bragg on Earth Day.

“This is the correct time for an
international project like this,"
says Bragg. “As socialism is
rethought around the world, it’s
important that we don’t lose our
political culture. We can’t throw
the baby out with the bathwater”.

Billy Bragg will appear in an
all-age show at Graﬂiti on Sept.
18 with special guest 0 Positive.

A2/ant garde
jazz band
Curlew
plays CM U

By Steven Heineman
The Pitt News

Curlew is a quintet of world-
class improvising musicians
associated with New York City's
“downtown” scene. But don’t be
frightened. Curlew has become a
funk—rock-jazz-country-etc.
crowd—pleaser by building its
musical world on pleasingly terse
rhythms and simple, joyful
melodies.

The group is led by Mississippi-
born saxophonist/composer
George Cartwright. He’s been
working on the “downtown”
scene for over 10 years, but feels
that, although he was not exposed
to much of the blues around him
as a child, the deep-running
southern roots are the not—so—
secret ingredient in Curlew’s

cohesive stew. His playing

features an encyclopedic range,
from Ornette Coleman-style
melodic declarations, to a hard-
edged R&B tenor style, to Anthony
Braxton-like experimentation. In
his compositions, he seems to
like tightly weaving his melodies
through maniacally constructed
rhythm-section arrangements that
resemble a Chevy V8 engine.
Cartwright has only had a
regular lineup for Curlew for
about three years. Before, that
revolving door had brought
through such talents as Fred Frith,
Bill Laswell and Nicky Skopelitas,
but with slightly less-than-

Paths of Rhythm
RCA

On A Tribe Called Quest’s
debut release, you feel as though
you’re traveling with the group
down the road of rap music.

This travel through a musically
inclined world starts out with
“Push It Along.” You move with
the Tribe as they push it along,
and you flow with the music
and actual experiences of the
group. “After Hours” deals with
going out late at night, partying
and just having a good time. “I

an ear for the finer things in life

 

Left My Wallet in El Segundo” is
the standout track on the album.
This song deals with the Tribe's
travel across the Mexican border.
Surrounded by a kicking drum
set and a humorous story line,
this could be one of the year’s
sleepers.

“Bonita Applebum,” the
current single, expresses Tribe
member Q-Tip’s affection for a
certain young lady. Q-Tip raps
ever so softly on this rap/lullaby,
mixed with an exciting beat and
sitar. “Bonita Applebum" stands
out as another winner. “Can I
Kick It?” is in the same category.

“Tribe Called Quest one of rap’s

Centering on dancin’, Q-Tip
expands his feelings on the
subject of “the art of movin’
your butt.” Fellow rapper Phiff
also adds his ﬂair on the tune as
well as on “Ham ‘n Eggs.” One
of the record’s most innovating
songs, “Ham ‘n Eggs” states the
T ribe’s true inner soul. It has a
comic as well as a serious side.

This rounds off the Tribe’s
debut'LP. One should not forget
such tracks as “Footprints,”
“Youth Expressing,” “Mr.
Muhammed” and “Description
of a Fool [the last on tape and
CD onlyl.” Q-Tip, Phiff, Jarobi
and Mr. Muhammed make A

most promising new acts,
pushing Peoples Instinctive

to the top. It may also be one of
the best LPs of 1990.

THE PI'I'I' NEWS, Thursday, September 13, 1990

 

Miles and miles of smiles at the Pitt lmprov theater

Jim Wechsler
Staﬂ‘ Writer

“Welcome, everyone!” Jeffrey
DeVincent’s booming voice
echoes across the room, answered
by thunderous applause. It’s
Friday, and the Improvs have
begun.

DeVincent, manager of the
Studio Theatre and graduate-
student liaison to the faculty, along

TRACEY

with co—host Pattie Miles, a third-
year graduate student, are once
again the instigators of the
evening's festivities. In keeping
with tradition, the night of
improvisations, theater games and
miscellaneous entertainment

begins with a game of “freeze.”

Two volunteers are given a
relationship and a situation by
members of the audience. They
begin a scene involving these

characters that has a beginning,
a middle and progresses toward
an end. Eventually, someone in
the crowd calls for the volunteers
to freeze the action, tapping one
of them on the shoulder and
creating a new situation and
relationship which the remaining
volunteer must continue. This
can, and often does, last for up to

an hour. It’s a perennial favorite:

with the lmprov throngs.

Other games include: “first line/
last line,” “toys [object improvs]”
and “the two little people that
make things work.” These games
all help to develop different
aspects of the participant's acting
skills. But don’t tell them that!
They’re having too much fun.

DeVincent and Miles instituted
the Improvs as a program “to
give the [undergraduate students]
an outlet” and to inspire more

interest in the theatre-arts‘
department as a whole. The

original crowd of approximately

50 students has multiplied and
diversified. A typical crowd now
consists of members of all

academic backgrounds from Pitt
and surrounding schools and

universities, and even‘
neighborhood residents.

DeVincent couldn't be happier.

“It’s like an extended family," he

says.

The Improvs’ illustrious history
began ﬁve years ago when
DeVincent, then a sophomore at
Northern Illinois University,
gathered some friends together,
and proposed the concept. The
program was “second-rate,” he
confesses, because the audience
was almost solely theatre-arts and
art majors, who could and often
did just amble down to Second
City for professional
entertainment. Still, it fared
respectably, and when DeVincent

came to Pitt as a graduate student .

last year, he brought the Improvs
with him. They were a colossal
hit.

Over the summer, DeVincent
and friends experimented with
new ideas and games, like the
lmprov-o-tron computer, so this
season is not just the same old
hat. The modest admission charge
of one dollar is donated directly ‘

educator in rap music, KRS-One
and Boogie Down Productions.

KRS-One and BDP hit the rap
scene in early 1987. They returned
in 1988 with By All Means
Necessary and again in 1989 with
Blue Print of Hip Hop. On BDP’s
new release, Edutainment, KRS
and his crew pick up the
educational style of rap where
they left off.

Edutainment opens with
“Exhibit A,” a sampling of KRS’s
lecture tour. KRS sheds light on
many subjects (rap music, racism,
uplifting Africa, taxes, slavery and
the revolution) with “Examples
A-F.”

“Blackman In Effect” continues
with the idea of spreading
knowledge of black history. KRS-
One holds the key to spreading
this knowledge. His ability to rap
ideas, focusing on what he feels
black Americans need to hear, is
the one thing that sets BDP apart
from other rap groups.

“Beef” shows KRS’s feelings
about what meat goes through in
the process line. “Love’s Gonna
Get’cha (Material Love)” is the

-first single from Edutainment.

“Love” shows that love does not
have to do with material things
but with real—life experiences and
feelings from the inner soul.

Side Two of Edutainmentstarts
off with “Ya Strugglin,” featuring
comedian Kwane Towe. Here
KRS focuses on the “fake” black
man or commercial stereotype of
black men. KRS raps about and
criticizes new looks in fashion,
hairstyle and attitude. The title
track from Edutainment features
a unique “ska” beat and centers
around KRS’s position in the rap
industry and the real meaning
behind his music: BDP, peace
and unity.

“The Kenny Parker Show”
highlights none other than Kenny
Parker. “Original Lyrics [featuring
Special Kl” centers on rappers
who take original music and use
it for their own pursuit of fame.
“The Racist” closes Edutainment

All in all, BDP’s latest release is
a healthy one. KRS-One seems to
shared more of his knowledge
on this release than on his past
albums. Pick up Edutainment,
