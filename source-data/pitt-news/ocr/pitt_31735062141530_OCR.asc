Announcement made Friday

ave been found.
concerning the name selected by

« the executive board of the semi-weekly was to the effect that only
‘one name had been submitted, chosen as the name of the semi-weekly

_ paper.

A re-check of the 1,000 ballots re-v‘

turned in the contest, shows how-
ever that two‘ ballots were returned
bearing the name PIT’1‘.NEWS.
Miss Jean Howard, Ed. '34, 1452 Penn
' avenue, submitted the name in the
contest, besides that of Milton. 0.
Krochmal, Ed. '31, 3567 Cable place.
In order that each one may receive

the full, beneﬁt from the contest,“
K members of the executive board----
Wilfred" Berman, Thomas B. Cum-

mings, Franklin A. Kallfelz, and
William Theis~—ha.ve decided to ap-
-propriate an additional $10 from
their budget to award two prizes of
, equal value, instead of only one.

Today ﬁnal steps in the selection
of the name for the semi-weekly will
be made when checks are mailed to
both winners in the recent contest.
.More than 1,000" names were sub-
mitted in the Pitt Weekly “Name
Your Newspaper" contest, recently
closed, to determine the name of the
semi-weekly publication. In that to-
tal over one hundred’ different names
were submitted by students over the
campus. ' ' P
1 When the ‘contest closed, October 1,-
the. job {of trying to pick a suitable
nameibecame evident to members of
the executive board of the NEWS.

~ Names were set aside, then rejected.
Some were-4-rejected only to later be
set aside for consideration. ‘Long
names, short names, names that
seemed to balance one against an-
other,‘ names lettered beautifully on
paper exactly the masthead size of
the paper——all appeared on the ‘bal-
lots to be subject for consideration.

The most prominent names of the
total a.ppea.rin.g, were “The Pitt Bea-
con,” and “The Cathedral Beacon.”
More than one hundred ballots ap-
peared in the total for these names
alone. Others to appear in promi-
nence were “The Pitt Star,” “Cathe-

‘ dralesque,” “Pitt Semi-nar,” “Pitt
R‘ecord,”,“Pitt Herald,” “Pitt Times,”
and “Pitt Monitor.” ‘

The board felt that somehow none

‘ of these names seemed" to ﬁt. Some
were too long, others, were of a too
high sounding nature to be used as
the name of a newspaper, still others
seem to fall in being dtpplicable as
an “all campus” name. ‘

When the name of PITT NEWS
appeared among the thousand being
looked over, the judges hesitated.
“News” has a good sound, it wasl
short, seemed to typify what the
Weekly had tried to do in its four-
teen years of existence——gather the
student news over the campus——and
seemed to meet the qualiﬁcations set
up by the executive board.

Theﬁnal choice was not made until
a few hours before the semi-weekly
was to go to press Thursday. So it
was decided to announce the winner
in order that the paper might appear
last week under its new name.

Milton "C. Krochmal, is a graduate
ofthe University, having ﬁnished his
undergraduate work leading to a
bachelor of arts. degree in 1931. Last
year he completedhis work towards
a masters degree, majoring in Ger-
man.

This year Mr. ‘Krochmal is teach-

ing dramatic English at the Langley
evening high school.
 Miss Howard is a member of the
Panther staff, Women's Glee Club,
and Owens, honorary sophomore wo-
Ine1'1’s activity fraternity.

Several graduate students were

, Needy Young Men
~   Seen in ‘Register’

If you are a young, industrious, but
needy young man, how would you
like to work your way through school
by waiting on the table of «the Carle-
ton-Joneses? Or perhaps you would
like to chauffeur the young debutante
daughter of the Pen-dleton-Smythes?
Well’, if you are a young, industrious,
but needy youngiman, perhaps some
day you will be» able to do one of
these pleasant duties. Mr. Bennett,
director of the Employment Bureau
for men, is -working on a plan for
Pitt students who earn their way
through school. - ‘
You see, Mr. Bennett has been go-'
ing through Pittsburgh’s Blue Book
for the names of wea1thy"Pittsburgh-
ers who might be persuaded to aid
needy Pitt men. And if the scheme
succeeds—well, many engineers, doc-
tors, and possibly some lawyers will
.'be extremely grateful to the good
people of Pittsburgh who may coop-
erate in the plan.

THE ‘ rharr-r NEWS

Hound; Visions of Future

when deadlines are sta.ring them

INCHES is the password of all Mr.
Maulsby’s cub reporters. And
thought that theme writiiig was too
muchwork. ' ' ‘ « ~ _'
At least I could_ sit down in my
orange studio, gaze, soulfully out of
the windows and write _ Florence

day of journalism we learned that
ha.r‘d-boiled reporters] had to write
amid the" din of ~the_ News oﬂice.
“Izzy,” the curly-haired typist, is
blowing smoke in my face; but they
wo_n’t let me eat in the staff room.
Oh, to -be one of the privileged few!
Of course, when I signed up for re--

porting, I had visions ‘of being a sec-

ond Lee Tracy, but columns don’t
count for inches. , Maybe I'll be more
popular if I leave “blessed events”
alone. ’ '

-While I have been typing, hundreds
(oh, well, dozens anyway) of re-
porters have come in the oﬂice, typed
their stories, _* and sauntered out. I
can't understand why the copy for
the.Panther, Owl, and News isn’t
mixed up inthe process. There are a
lot of “big shots” around here,-but
they are never around’ when needed.
The reporters show each other their
leads and inquire how to spell. The
editors sit aroundwith pipes in their
mouths (the men, I mean-9-—--arrdl their
feet on the desk.

One cub reporter to another: “What

wrote are wrong?”
Second reporter:

Phelps Completes Text
On Sociology Problems

 

Dr. Harold A. Phelps, professor of
sociology, recently completed a. so-
ciological text book which is the sub-
ject of much discussion. His text
tries to state problems of sociology,
rather than to solve them. It empha-
sizes many problems that have been
too big to be adequately solved.

The ﬁrst of four sections ofthe

book takes the economic sources of
social disorganization and deals with
that phase of sociology. Physical and
mental sources of social problems
comprise the second -section, and the
third deals with the cultural sources
of social disorganization. A fourth
parte serves as the summary of both
the book and the problems presented.

Grid Schedule

Panthers to Play Nine Games;
‘ Will Schedule W. 6* J.

 

Vvith the exception of two dates,
which have not as yet been ﬁlled,
Pit'l;’s football schedule for 1933 is
complete. Nine games will be played]
next fall, instead of the ten~gam.e
schedule arranged this fall for the

Pitt's 1933 S’ClflE?P(llllf;b will begin one
week later than this year, the first
game announced to be played on Sep-
tember 30. The opponent for this
game has not as yet been selected,
but will be announced by the end of
this month.

The Panthers travel to Morgantown
the following week to meet West Vir-
ginia in the t'wenty—nintli game in the
series between the two schools.

Navy will play Pitt in the Stadium.
This game will re-
place the Army game of this and last
year.

Pitt will: meet its second Big Ten

travel to ‘Minneapolis to play Minne-
sota, the game being sclieduled for
October .31. The following week
Pitt’s opponent will be Notre'Dan1e
at South Bend. ' ' .

No opponent as yet. has been sched-

Give Walter Rome credit for be-
ing the first one to yell “Hooray”
after the Alma Mater was played.

The De’s have it on the Duke
squad with DeLuca, Decafbo,
and D-eCoster, but D-eLuca seems
to be the only one-of the three
that has any outstanding foot-
ball ability. , -
It must be admitted that Pitt looked

rather foolish on the underhand pass
the Dukes used, but the -second time
it was used, the receiver must have
thought plenty about the new rule
prohibiting “piling on.”

Opponents of Pitt'who have
been expecting the backs to be
the receivers of most of the pass-
es must have -gotten a surprise
when both Daily and Sklandany
grabbed a couple. '

four of the regular backs can throw
passes as well as receive them.
Reider’s leg was taped up just
in case he would be needed, but

Sebastian pnroved quite a capa-

ble“ understudy, and may see
 more action this year than Reid-

er. -

For some strange reason or other,
both the band and the student color
card secti-on looked exceptionally
good, a.nd its safe to. bet that the
band is thinking of the showing
that the Ohio State boys will make.

Incidentally, both the Ohio

‘State and Notre Dame bands,

two of the best collegiate organ-

izations of their kind in this
country, will appear at the Stadi-‘
urn this year.

Chacko, DeLuca, and Avington, of
the Dukes have done some boxing at
one timeor another, while the box-
ers on the Pitt squad include -Seigel,
Schricker, Heller, Luch, Sekay, Love,
Thompson, and Shotwell. The pub-
licity department‘ passed up a good
opportunity to. spring a "battle roy-
al" after the game. ‘

Pitt subs have not seen much
action ‘after the opener for the
past few years, but now they seem
to be getting-a break. Keep your
eye, or eyes, on O’D-ell‘, Ormiston, —

Simms, Brown,_ and. Timmons

among others. All will 'be.back

next year unless the depression

gets them. 
tire covers advertising the Panthers,
and a. brake company put out those
with a Duke ad on. Could you say
that the brakes weren't strong

Goodall:-2 Attends Meeting '
Of Am; Bureau of Welding

 

Dr. S. .-L. Goodale, of the Depart-.
ment of Metallurgy in the School of
Mines, attended the meeting of the
American Bureau of VVelding held in
Buffalo, N. Y., from October 3 to 7.

The meeting was held in conjunc-
tion with that of the American So-
ciety of Steel Treating. Dr. Goodale.

was continued as a member of the
committee on fundamental research
in welding. ‘

“W. & J. will play Pitt in 1933,” is
the statement made by Don W. Har-
rison, director of athletics, in announc-
ing the schedule yesterday. _

The rumor that there is a break
coming in the athletic departments of
W. «Sb J. and Pitt was branded false
by Harrison. “The 0nl.y thing hamper-
ing our arranging the game with W.
& J. for the coming year is our ina-
bility to agree on a date, and that is

the only thing holding that game un-

decided.” ,

While most of his. classmates were

coming back to college by motor car
ortrain, a Bucknell student paddled
his own canoe down the Susquehanna
river—a distance of 196 miles by road
—to the Lewisburg (Pa.) university.

Recently, a co-ed at the Louisiana
State U. arrived at Baton Rouge on
horseback, driving nine head of cattle
which she offered as payment for her

it that West Pointers are sniping for

these Army boys do not forget'—other

On the other hand, Jock ‘Suther-

weeks will be the appearance of Paul-

Reider, captain of the Panthers who
has ‘been sitting on the-bench since
his injury in. the Ohio Northern
game. - ’

And the Army reports to that
“They’ll need him, and many more.”
Somehow the Panthers believe that’s
just another way of expressing the
old army game——a fooler.

a person is safe from contagious
disease if he is intoxicated! 0

But no college man ever pulls
boners with a good pipe between his

teeth. There's something about a_

pipe and tobacco that soothes a man,
helps him think straight. That is, of
course, if: he uses the right tobacco.
A recent z'nvestigatz'on showed Edge-
worth to be the favorite tobacco at
42 out of 54 leading colleges.

If you’re not already an Edgeworth
smoker, there's new smoking satis-
