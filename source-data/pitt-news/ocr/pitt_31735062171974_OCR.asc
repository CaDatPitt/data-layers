day during a phone conversa-

The Citizenship Information Center (CIC) may fall victim to
Pitt‘s current fiscal crisis.

The University. already $12 million in debt and anticipating
a $4 million deficit for the 1971-72 fiscal year. is seeking to cut
certain “peripheral programs”. such as the CIC. to help ease its
financial woes.

At a recent Senate Council meet-
ing, Vice Chancellor for Finance
Edison Montgomery brought up
the idea of eliminating the CIC on

Ging charged that Lawson's
unilateral handling of the re-

more resources to do the job it
was intended to do.

Ms. Erma Meyerson, chair-
man of the Student Affairs Com-

Ratiﬁes Constitution

by LORETTA HORRELL

Delegates to the Pennsylvania Association of College and Uni-
versity Student Governments adopted a constitution during a meet-
ing at Pitt this weekend. I

The purposes of the organization as cited in the Constitution
are “to promote a high degree of cooperation and mutual help be-
tween the institutions of higher learning in the Commonwealth. to
provide opportunities for students to participate cooperatively and
collectively in state and national issues relevant to the member in-
stitutions and constituent student bodies. and to establish a student
interest advocate lobby in Harrisburg."

Of 136 accredited colleges and universities in Pennsylvania.
25 have actively participated in the conventions held at Penn State
and Pitt. The group represents a collection of over 8800 college
students. from Pennsylvania colleges.

Dennis Concilla, student Association (SA) Programs Commis-
sioner and one of the organizers of the conference described it as
productive. Besides adopting a Constitution, delegates gave sev-

eral reports , formed various new committees, and discussed plans‘

for the lobby’s office in

Representativesfrom Temple University reported on the pro-
gress of the Master Plan for High Education. The Master Plan. not
yet completed. recommends aid to individual students rather than
state aid’ to colleges.

The Temple group said there is a possibility the State Legis-
lature will pass the Plan.

Penn State representatives reported on a court case, “The De-
mocratic” “Party versus Center County”. in which a group of Penn
State students are involved. .

Harrisburg .

The case deals with voter registration. Because the Federal Cen-
sus counts college students as residents of the county in which
their school lies. the group said it feels that college students should
be eligible to register to vote in the county of their recorded resi-
dency. If the group wins the case. the eligible voting students at
Penn State would hold the majority of Center County's votes.

Also formed were a Legislative,Action Committee and a Cul-
tural and Social Committee of which Lenny Klavonic, SA Social
Commissioner, is chairman. . . 1 -

 

curate.” Ging also reported that
when two arrested students
sought funds under the bail bond
program. Lawson bypassed the
LAC and took the request direct-
ly to Director of Student Acti-
vities Bill Markus.

“To blunder into something
like this without contacting the
people doing the work is ridicu-
lous,”saidGing. .

Ging said that Lawson had
“misrepresented“ the findings
of the LAC when he presented
the bail bond project before
the administration. and that this
had jeopardized the future of the
program. According to Ging. the
bondsman. who did supply bail
for the two students. has yet to be
reimbursed by anyone from the
University.

“Lawson acted entirely on his
own initiative." said Ging. “and
the University is not responsible
for that debt.“

Ging, a former news editor of
the Pitt News. claimed that re-
lations between Lawson and the
LAC were hampered by a lack
of “downward communication.”
He said the problems were both
personal and systemic. .

“There's just no communica-
tion.“ said Ging. “I never knew
what the Social Commission.
Programs Commission. or Aca-
demic Commission was doing.
No communication ever came
down the lines."

Ging likened the SA admin-
istration to a _“dictatorship“.

RA ’s Protest

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor.

A committee of black Resident Assistants (R.A.’s) have sub-
mitted a list of requests to the Housing Office that would give black
viewpoints better representation within the area of student housing.-

John Vrana. Director of Housing. said the committee. headed

by R. A.'s Juan Lovelace and Everett Bannister, made two requests’: 
that a black housing administrator be hired. and that blacks be rep-—

resented on the various student
advisory boards that work with
the Housing Office.

“I think the requests made
are reasonable." said Vrana. They
will provide us with the input we
need in Housing to make de-
cisions for operating our pro-
grams.

“I have felt for a long tin“
that the housing staff _ uld have
a black administrator with broad
functions and responsibilities."
he said. “one who can provide
an input in our level of dece-
sion-making that makes in the
viewpoint of the black com-
munity."

Pointing out the growing per-
centage of black resident stud-
ents. the Housing Director said
the need for such input was “ob-
vious".

Vrana indicated that the Hous-

ing Office will hire a black ad-
ministrator before September.

He said he could see a simi-_“
lar need for black studer --p-g

resentatives on various . '.ng
committees.

“We‘ll try to nave more black
R. A.'s and add biE1\_t\ students

to such committees as the Food’

Service Committee.“ Vrana '_
said. '
The Housing Office is now

trying to organize a search com-
mittee to work in conjunction
with black RA’s in developing a

job description and a process for " .

interviewing prospective admin-
istrators. The committee will

also make a recommendation on i

Executive Assistant Johnstown Bouittlg

by LORETTA HORRELL

Jack E. Freeman. executive
assistant to the Chancellor, has
been named to succeed retiring
Dr. Theodore Biddle as President
of the University’s Johnstown ex-
tension, July 1.

Freeman summarized his
views on education and his plans
for the Johnstown Campus in a
recent Pitt News interview.

EDUCATION REFORM

Freeman said that the next 20
years of education will be re-
volutionary. He remarked, “A
reform for higher education, as

I see it. is desirable and in-
evitable.”
He has strongly supported

many changes in the college, for
example the establishment of a

lcredit—no entry system, the abo-

lishment of. a language require-
ment, and the establishment of
self-designed majors.

“Education must be defined as
training to deal with today‘s
problems.” said Freeman. Sup-
porting educational changes
that give a student the ability
to continue changes in his role.
Freeman “believes will enable
a student to change problems
in society.

“There’s always a role for ex-
perience in education as oppos-
ed to book learning,” asserted
Freeman.

“A total re-evaluation of the
educational process must begin
in the elementary and secondary
levels before revolutionary chan-

Freeman: Years of

ges can be made in higher edu-
cation,” explained Freeman.
“As the system permeates high-
er education must change also.”

Freeman indicate that he
doesn't believe in the present
“lock-step" curriculum. Stu-

dents should have an opportun-

'ity to decide their own course

structure. “Education must be
an individualized process,” he
said.

“Progress in the open-class-
room and non—graded systems
suggest that present concepts of
learning are wrong. “the admin-

Finance Office Revamped,

Vice Chancery Twinned

by RON LOZOWSKI

The office of Vice Chancellor
of Finance will soon be abolish-

—-ed, with duties formerly assign-

ed to this office being delegated
to two new posts: Vice Chan-
cellor for Operations, and Vice
Chancellor for Planning and
Budgeting.

Edison Montgomery, currrent-
ly Vice Chancellor for Finance,
will assume the latter position.

In the‘past. the Vice Chan-
cellor of Finance had been re-
sponsible for all internal ad-
ministrative services. In 1967. the
reorganization of the University
was featured by the creation of
the office of Director of Plan-
ning and Budgeting. This direc-
tor reported to the Vice Chan-
cellor of Finance.

According to Jack Freeman.
Executive Assistant to the Chan-
cellor, Chancellor‘ Wesley Pos-

cellor of Finance, Edison Mont-
gomery. were becoming exces-
sive. He therefore moved for
the creation of the new offices.

Under the new system. the
Planning and Budgeting officer
will handle matters relating’ to
planning. budgeting. architec-
tural planning. and space. The
remaining duties will be carried
out by the Vice Chancellor for
Operations.

A search committee appoint-
ed this past winter screened al-
most 1000 applicants for the Op-
erations post. The appointee to
the position will be announced
later this week. ans will assume
his new duties approximately
Augustl.

istrator commented. Freeman
expressed confidence that to-

days efforts in education will
produce better students and that
student.s will be keyed to a dif-
ferent approach for college.

CHANGES FOR JOI-INSTOWN

Freeman will_spend the next
six months planning philo-
sophies and objectives for Johns-
town .

His first priority at Johnstown
is to make it a four year college.

Johnstown, the oldest and lar-
gest campus branch in the U.S..
now accomodates 1800 full-time
and 600 part time undergradu-
ate students.

In .1963. an attempt to con-
vert it into a four year school
fell through due to financial dif-
ficulties. Since 1965. however, a
gradual developing process has
brought Johnstown closer to es-

tablishing itself as an accredit-'-

ed four year school. Currently.
students at Johnstown must
complete their studies at the
main campus.

Freeman plans to expand field
courses. “I hope to develop dis-
tinctive fields of education that
are different in kind." stated
Freeman. “not mere liberal arts.
but courses unique in design."

Programs will be initiated to
attract blacks. students from
Appalachia. and foreign students.

Dormitories will be enlarged
in an attempt to attract a cos-
mopolitan population. Johns-

Ileserve An Apartment Now

town presently has five dorms
housing 650 students.

A new and innovative program
in engineering technology will
begin in the fall. Freeman term-
ed it “a badly needed program
in terms of public service." The
program will be of high quality.
but different from regular en-
gineering schools.

CHANGE ON CAMPUS

Freeman abandoned a career
in the US.» Air Force in 1967 to
take the position of Executive As-
sistant. While in the military.
Freeman was the Assistant to
the Deputy of Planning and
International Affairs and also a
faculty member at the Air Force
Academy.

He received a B.A. degree in
political sciience and econo-
mics and is now completing his
doctorate in education at Pitt.

Freeman said he found a “pla-
cid. conservative campus," when
he arrived at Pitt in 1967. a
“1i1.V- white institution”.

In the four years he’s been at
Pitt. Freeman has been many
programs initiated to change

‘ that atmosphere. Major programs

A Freeman: Education Reform Inevitable

for disadvantaged students were
initiated. black educators as-
sumed roles on the faculty. and
students became more active in
administrative programs. For
example. students sit in on Fac-
ulty Senate meetings.

“Students play a much more
vital role inythe institution now.
because of the faculty and ad-
ministration’s willingness to lis-
ten to grievances." he said.

“In the last four years, the
principle achievement at the
University has been the crea-
tion of mechanisms in which
changes can be made.”

(Editor’s note: This is the
first in a series of articles on the
Learning Research and Develop-

Pitt News reporter Marlene
Znoy will examine some of the
experimental educational equip-
ment and methods employed by
the Center. In this initial article,
Znoy focuses on the Center's
background and purpose. .

Researchers have traditionally
focused their attention and tal-
ents upon solving, or at least
modifying, basic social problems.
A polio epidemic rages and a
Jonas Salk develops a vaccine.
However. in the field of educa-

little research has been done.

It was for this purpose that
the Learning Research and De-
velopment Center of the Univer-
sity (LRDC), a muIti-dimension-
al, intra-disciplinary facility for
the study of educational prob-
Iems and environments, was de-
veloped. The Center was the
brainchild of Drs. Robert Glas-
er and J. Steele Gow. .

The University began fund-
ing the Center in October, 1963.
Less than a year later, the Re-
search Branch of the United
States Office of Education sel-
ected it as one of the first of
nine such centers eligible for
government funding. Dr. Glaser,

a professor of psychology, re-
mains the director of the center

The Center's philosophy. he-
hind education rests on the
premise that learning is highly
individualized. “We try to set
up a particular social environ-
ment where children can man-
age their own instruction and
to according to their own pace
and accomplishments,” explain-
ed Glaser. .

The instructional programs de-
signed by the center. whether in
science, mathematics or lang-
uage arts, are geared so that
when the student stops working,
the learning process stops. The
student does not depend on the
teacher for input. In this way,
students. who must work for
mastery in their programs be-
fore they can go on, feel chal-
lenged and, as a result, attempt
competence.

On a recent visit to one of the
schools, a Harvard psychologist
was plesantly amused when he
asked a little girl a question and
she responded, “Can’t you see
that I’m working?”

Much of the Center's work
involves computer-assisted in-
struction. Lesson plans are pro-
grammed enabling three- and
four-year old. children to be
taught basic number concepts
via computer. Other develop-
ments such as the “talking type-
writer” can be used to teach
reading skills. .

Students in the pilot schools,

‘Glaser reports, do as well on

standardized tests as students
from traditional schools, “but
they do it all on their own.”

Oakland Pops Out 

~ Nostalgic sports buffs and visionary social- reformers, unite!
The University has decided to demolish Forbes Field, rejecting
’a People’s Oakland proposal to convert the Field into a learning-liv-
~in‘g-communication hub for students and members of the Oakland
community.

-With the demolition, memories of spit-balls and bean-balls may

  

"' fade, and dreams for meaningful interaction between the University

- and the community may be replaced by the incubus of an insatia-

ble, intransigent, expansionist Pitt. .
The razing of Forbes Field, which will probably lead to the

.P , _-successful completion of the University’s Forbes Phasevl plan. vir-

tually dooms an ambitious and imaginative People's Oakland pro-

- A posal.

. On the Forbes Field site, People’s Oakland would have construct-
ed educational and commercial facilities, dwelling units. a recrea-
tional park, an organic food garden. and a day-care center - an

'  ‘ idyllic link between Pitt and society.

_-In rejecting the People's Oakland plan. the University has
-displayed a notable lack of daring. patience. and concern. The For-
bes Phase I plan, to be funded by the state and already approved by

' the General State Authority, is a sure bet.

The recommendations of People’s Oakland, in contrast, are sket-
chy and risky. It might take People’s Oakland the entire summer, per-
haps longer, to come up with an acceptable alternative to the Forb-

‘. es Phase I program. .

.-_Nevertheless, the delay could prove worthwhile. With an

 (A additional ‘four months, People’s Oakland architects could revamp

'th“eir blueprints, and others could determine the views of Oakland
residents by ‘conducting a survey — something the University
‘did not consider necessary.

But the University appears bent on constructing a Law School,

I .’a Social Science complex. and a School of Education (Phase I)
2. ~A without further pause.

The University tries to console People‘s Oakland by offering to
listen to its plans for Phases II and III. when the time comes. But.

,_ , according to Vice—Chancellor Edison Montgomery, the University

will’ not finance People’s Oakland proposals for non-academic build-
ings — facilities that will ‘not be financed by the state either.
Thus. People’s‘Oakland must seek outside sources of financ-

ing. And. unless the University agrees to a People’s Oakland plan
for Phase II or Phase III, People’s Oakland must approach founda-

,_tions and financiers without University backing.

Moreover, People’s Oakland will undoubtedly encounter the

_ _'same obstacle with Phases II and III — a University much more sen-
' ’sitive to faculty pressure. The outlook for People’s Oakland is very

bleak, and the University knows it. .

With the odds in its favor, the University chose to

 I for two months. It gave People’s Oakland until May 14 to come up
. ‘ with an acceptable alternative to the Forbes Phase I plan devised
’ by the University. Once the deadline expired it proceeded to soli-

cit, bids for the demolition of Forbes Field.
The University also agreed to delay construction of the Hill-

I  side Dormitories. Later, it concurred with People’s Oakland that

the University’s planned high-rise. structures should be scrapped
in favor of terraced dorms — a commendable concessioni
“All men make mistakes,” Sophocles wrote. “But the wise
man yields when he knows his course is wrong, and repairs the
evil.’.’
In modifying its Hillside Dormitories plans, the University
has demonstrated a laudable willingness to reassess its course.

Inlclinging tenaciously to its Forbes Phase I design, the

  University’ has proved Sophocles right. Men do make mistakes.

Perhaps the University fears an adverse reaction from within
should it delay demolishing Forbes Field for four months.

_. Perhaps the University fears the wrath of alumni ‘shocked that
it should be seriously entertaining the notion of a “People’s Park.”

Most charitably, perhaps the University believes Forbes Phase
I should be constructed swiftly, for the sake of future students.

In any case, the University is behaving like an island. And. as
an urban university, it cannot.

People’s Oakland may not be representative of the Oakland com-
munity. But at least People's Oakland is anxious to discern the com-
munity’s view of new buildings that will inevitably affect Oak-
land residents.

“The fact that the wider community is passive," Kim Fellner. a
People’s Oakland member, emphasizes, “doesn't make the _Univers-
ity either approved or right.” »

I The Pitt News urges People’s Oakland. to continue its crusade.
If People’s Oakla_nd perseveres, the University may eventually re-

 I pair the evil’.

Trustees Should
Provide Leadership

by MIKE HALEY
Staff Columnist

(Second of a two-part series).

Last week I discussed what the leg-
islature and governor should do on a
macro-level to improve the plight of
the educational consumer. I suggested
the problem of burgeoning costs could
be handled partially" by instituting a
modified “Yale plan" for students.

More immediately. the state could
make educational planning more equi-
table by equalizing the tuition rates
at all the state-related universities
through its appropriation policies. (Pre-
sently Pennsylvania residents pay
$675 a year at Penn State, while at
Pitt they pay $850),

But in the long run we must rea-
lize that we cannot escape the fiscal
mess of universities with these fin-
ancial gimmicks alone.

So the incentives that I suggested
for improving services are not by them-
selves the final solution. They are not
the panaceas they seem since they go
around the problem instead of to it.

The basic problem of higher educa-
tion is leadership. When the top
management of a university sacrifices
its authority and responsibility to who-
ever grabs for it, all you get is educa-
tional and operational chaos. To pre-
vent this chaos, the leadership of uni-
versities should be held accountable
for their performance. O

According to Professor Perlman, who
was in charge of Pitt's Professional
Productivity study. the university man-
agement should begin to identify res-
ponsibility in its departments and
schools.

Instead, now at Pitt many depart-
ments operate in some respects in near
vacuums. But once you identify res-
ponsibility, as Dr. Perlman sees it,
the Deans could judge performance
with the use of consultants and re-es-
tablish control in the vacuums that
now exist. .

He feels that before any proper per-
formance criteria can be established,
some administrators will have to be
educated. They will have to be made
aware of what teacher productivity
is and what educational performance
means.

Another vacuum that exists in uni-
versities is the lack of supervision of
research. There is hardly any assess-
ment of the research work done by
members of a department except to may-
be notice if anyone published anything.

. One way of improving the situation
is to require each faculty member to

‘ decide the goals of his research that will

be achieved over‘ a period of time. Then

ﬂthe de__par.tm“e.n’t would be able to make ’

 

 

assessments of the researcher’s work
by seeing if he is accomplishing
the job he promised to perform.

From a larger point of view, Pitt
loses money on the research work we
perform for the federal government.
According to Vice Chancellor Mont-
gomery, we lose 20 cents for each doll-
ar of federal money Pitt receives for
research.

What is ironic about this situation
is that it is possible to make money
or at least break even from contracting
with the government. If private re-
search companies can‘ make money,
why can’t Pitt? All that's missing is
the proper management.

And we need this proper manage-
ment especially if you consider that
sponsored research, training, and con-
sulting services cost Pitt $25.8 million
out of expenditures which totalled
$106.7 million for theyear ending June
30, 1970.

If there are problems, the trustees
should find out what's wrong. Present-
ly at Pitt they do’ not.

One reason for this situation is that
many trustees consider their positions
just status symbols. Instead, what Pitt
and most universities need are" compe-
tent trustees who will lead.

In other words, Pitt needs a work-
ing Board.

If Pitt had one, it would hopefully
demand performance from its top man;
agement and get it. If it does not get
adequate performance, the Board should
fire the present management and hire
the necessary leadership that will per-
form effectively.

The state has the power to get the
responsible and responsive Board of
Trustees that Pitt needs. The governor
and the legislature should exercise this
influence as soon as possible.

In conclusion, the trouble with
Pitt and most universities is that hardly
any effective leadership is being ex-
ercised to find the necessary answers
and solutions. And worse, no one seems
willing to even ask the right questions.

The attitudes of not knowing what
to do or not wanting to know seem to
be the real crisis in leadership in high-
er education today.

These institutions may have worked

in the past, butlthey have since grown-

into modern dinosaurs with the large
infusions of money and students over
the years.

If we continue past policies of “be-
nign neglect,” we will be consumed
by these dinosaurs with their glutton-
ous inefficiency. Instead, we as educa-
tional consumers should demand per-

formance and get it. We" can no longer
K afford such waste. ~ — ‘

   

 

 

 , Whose

Drivel ls
Whose?

Editor:

The endless. personal disagree-
ments handled through the letters
to the editor of the Pitt News are
often boring. and I'd like to make
it clear that I do not wish to be-
gin one. But the letter in the
May 13th issue. by Paul Stef-
anick. prompts this reply and
comment.

To try to organize some kind of
rebuttal is just about impossi-
ble. Mr. Stefanick seems angry
at a great ‘many things ranging
from the Pitt News to Judy Col-
lins??!! '

I agree with what I assume
is Mr. Stefanick‘s major gripe.
the activities were pretty bad
this year. but I can’t agree with
his holding the Pitt News some-
how responsible.

.I must disagree with hisitotal
support of the SA commissioners.
I question the advisability of
their absolute control and un-
checked authority. "

Mr. Stefanick’s generalizations
and accusations are groundless
and’ absurd. Perhaps if he were
not so “wrapped up” in his gar-
bage in his Oakland apartment
and became an active part of the
campus and some of its many
fine organizations, Mr. Stefan-
ick would not lash out so vehe-
mently and foolishly. .

“Drive1“ is his choice of ad-
jective for the article he at-
tacked in the Pitt News. Per-
haps Mr. Stefanick was provid-
ing us with an example of dri-
vel when he submitted his let-
ter to the Pitt News?.

Pgh. Parks: For Explorers

by LEE mm...

I sense that for many Pitt stu-
dents the statements “Let's go to
the park“ and ‘=‘Let‘s go to Flag-
staff Hill“ are equivalent in
meaning. There is much more to
Schenley Park than Flagstaff and
their is much more to do in the
park than just sunbathing.

This article is published with
the hope that some people will
be spurred to get out and explore.

In the back of Schenley Na-
ture Museum there are steps
leading down into Panther Holl-
ow.

A few cindered nature paths
run on either side of the slopes.
One trail runs down to a marsh
on the valley floor. A round trip

up the valley on one trail and ‘

down it on the other takes about
11/: hours..

Picnic tables and secluded
groves are clustered in the area

across the Boulevard of the Al- _

lies. near Schenley Oval. Of all
the places in the park. this is
probably the prettiest.

Schenley Oval has a quarter

mile cinder track. expansive ball
playing grounds. tennis courts
and riding stables.

Schenley Park is the best place
to bicycle ride in Oakland. Traf-
fic is light. and potholes aren't
much of a problem. .

There is a magnificent view
of the sunset from the top of
the golf course.

Frick Park is a great place to
explore. The terrain is rugged
and there is a high degree of
ecological diversity. Some plac-
es look like tropical rain forests
with hanging vines and thick

vegetation. One grassy expanse.

looks a lot like savanah land.

For the nature lovers there is
a lot to discover at Frick. Last
year an .underground spring
popped out of the ground. Since
then it has dried up. A pheasant’s
squawk and wing beat often
startle hikers. Chipmunks and
rabbits scamper across trails.
There are mulberry trees and
black raspberry bushes to munch

Frick Park is about 112 miles
from campus. You can get there
by taking either the 61A or -61B
bus. getting off at either Forbes
and Beechwood or Forbes and
Braddock. The best bicycle
route is through the Schenley
Golf Course and/ on to Forbes
Avenue. ‘

Highland park is -the home of
the Pittsburgh Zoo. It has a few
picnic areas perched on top of
a bluff overlooking the Alle-
gheny River.

From campus by way of Neg-
ley Avenue, a bicycle ride takes
‘/2 hour. There is a 1.1 mile bicy-
.cling track around the reservoir.

The swimming pools at High-
land and Schenley Parks are fill-
ed after Memorial Day. At the
entrance to Frick near Forbes
and Beechwood. there is a bath-
ing fountain and a grassy area
that not many people use.

Playgrounds are found in ev-
ery park.

'New Leaf’: May Flowers Not

 ‘House’ Reaches Heights

By STEVE ZYCH

There have been many honor
anthologies made in Hollywood
Corman’s Tales of Terror and
Karloff's Black Sabbath, to name
a few. Most of them have been
simply ‘horrible (cinematically
speaking) with few exceptions.

House That Dripped Blood.
currently being shown at various
local theaters,_ is one of those
rare exceptions. Among other
things it features a literate script
by Robert Bloch (of Psycho fame ).
fine performances by all con-
cerned, craftsmanlike color pho-
tography, and a suitably menac-
ing setting.

The film contains four stories,
all set in an eerie mansion in
the somber British countryside,
which is to be expected for this
sort of film fare. What is ex-
ceptional is that most of the
stories are convincing.

The first tale concerns a mur-
der mystery writer who rents
the moldy manor so as to be in-
spired for his latest work. Not
only is he inspired but he be-
comes so involved in his work
that he begins to actually see
the main character, a demented
strangler, of his story. Or does
he?.

His headshrinker tells him that
the apparition is a manifestation
of his suppressed hostilities to-
wards his wife. but the writer

adamantly insists on the'reality
of his character.

The second story centers
around a hypnotic wax female
figure in a seedy museum of hor-
ors who turns out to be the em-
bodiment of the curator’s dead
wife. Her hypnotic stare brings
death to her admirers. a la Me-
dusa, who in this story happen
to be veteran horror star Peter
Cushing and newcomer Denhom
Elliot.

Unfortunately their talents are
largely wasted as the story does
not allow time for suspense to
mount. Also Cushing and Elliot
are mostly limited to facial ges-
tures and seem less alive than
the waxlike image they spend
so much time with..

The third tale is definitely the
best of the four. It concerns an
austere father and his darling
young daughter who seems afraid
of the towering and tyranical

old man, played to perfection by
six-foot-four Chris Lee. As the
tale thickens we realize that it is
Lee who is afraid of his devilish
daughter. It seems the little brat
(played beautifully by Chloe

     

Frank) is really a witch and the
old man knows it. The fiery end-
ing when the wily little witch
burns her progenitor to death is
the high point of the story as
well as the film.

The final fable is a sorry at-
tempt at camp humor which
doesn't quite come off. A val-
iant try by John Pertwee por-
traying an aging horror actor
who purchases a mysterious

cloak for his latest vampire pic
cannot save the script. It seems
that each time the old boy puts
the thing on. he actually be-
comes a full-blooded vampire.
It's strictly tongue-in-cheek and
highly inappropriate to the mood
and style of the film as a whole.
It destroys the authentic eerie
effect created by its three pre-
decessors.

On the whole, though, the an-
thology is superior stuff for
these type of films. if you
have any interest in horror or
murder mystery or even ribald
camp set in a Gothic background,
I recommend The House That
Dripped Blood.

The trite comedy was written
by Elaine May who directs and
co-stars in the film. Evidently
Ms. May is trying to follow in
the footsteps of her former com-
edy partner Mike Nichols. She
has a long way to go.

The film suffers from a time-

The script is not only time-

No matter what kind of car

not putting lead pollution in
the air. And you'll be helping

won't be lead deposits to foul

Only Amoco has two lead-
free grades of gasoline—one
for all cars, new or old.

Freshman star jumper Billy

Pitt on Tuesday afternoon. Rea
picked one of the young springs
finest days to set a new Pitt
long jump record which had stood
since 1948 to help pummel the
outclassed Owls, 102-41.

Rea’s jump, which was a foot
and a half better than any of his
previous jumps, measured 25
feet. seven inches. The old Pitt
record was 25-3. The jump also
shattered the Pitt Stadium set
two weeks ago at the Pitt Invi-
tational by Al Lanier of Cincin-
atti.

He also won the triple jump

Ten minutes before the start of last Friday’s second game
at Westminister, I approached Mike Fedoris after he had warmed
up. Jokingly, I said to him, “How about throwing a no-hitter so
I’ll have something to write about next week.”

Not only did Fedoris oblige by firing a no-hitter. but he sur-
passed my request by hurling the first perfect game ever in his ca-
reer. It was also the first ‘time that a Panther pitcher had thrown
a perfect game since Coach Bobby‘Lewis assumed the coaching
chores 16 years ago.

Until Friday afternoon Fedoris had been having control
problems and had an 0-4 record. From the outset of the game, it
was apparent that the Titan hitters were going to have problems
of their own trying to hit Fedoris’ fastball.

Before the contest, first game starting pitcher Rich Muse
had warned Fedoris about the condition of the mound.Accord-
ing to Muse, who fired a two-hitter in the opener, the mound
was in poor shape. It resembled more of a plateau than a regu-
lar bill.

This necessitated Fedoris to concentrate on bending his back
and following through with the delivery. His sometimes wild-
ness was nowhere to be seen. In fact, he went to the full count

with only one batter, but promptly
struck him out with a fast ball.

“I put it high-right under his chin,
but luckily he swung and missed.”
Fedoris said.

In the third inning, Fedoris and the
rest of the team became riled by a de-
cision by the plate umpire. This call,
coupled with previous questionable
calls gave Fedoris added incentive to
mow down the Titans. . . » is

“We were getting  home job’ by MIKE FEDORIS

the umps and I wanted to give them something to remember,”
recalled Fedoris after his brilliant performance.

The Panther defense complemented Fedoris’ pitching by
stowing away each batter that was lucky enough to get a piece
of the ball. Big Mike took care of ten Titans on strikeouts, while
the remainder of the squad put away the other eleven in the
seven inning game. '

“I couldn't have done it without the team-they played ter-
rifically.” .

As the outfielders took the field in the seventh. Lewis advised
them to take chances if necessary.

No sooner did he say this. but Westminister’s leadoff
man blooped a ball into short right field. Outfielder Bob Solon-
icktnﬁ beat the ball to the ground as he stabbed it with a diving
ea c . “

Throughout the game. Panthers on the bench remarked that
this was the fastest that Fedoris had been at Pitt. Guy Caprel-
li, who sat out the game in favor of Bill Schmitke at catcher.
said that they (Westminister) were swinging at the thump in
Schmitke’s glove.

 

-. Later that night in the motel in Cleveland, Mike showed me

ing;-the fact that this was the first time he had done so, he’ll

' i%fAt Number 1 Spot ‘ti?

By JAN FRY

When five foot six Gary Schwartz, top sing-
les player for Pitt, rushes the net he sometimes
wishes he was a giant so his next return would
be easier. However, in many ways he is a giant.

While visiting his brother in Philadelphia,
four years ago, Schwartz, who wrestled four
years at Shaler High and always enjoyed base-
ball, ping pong, and badmitton. became inter-
ested with the idea of hitting a ball after one
bounce. 0

“My brother is the sole one to get me inter-
ested in the sport,” remarked the Pitt junior.
“He put the racquet in my hand and taught me
the strokes.”

Now, only in his second year of competition-
his first being in number two singles at Slippery
Rock — Schwartz holds the number one spot at
Pitt, received the job as pro at Wildwood Coun-
try Club for the summer, and was invited to
play with the National Indoor Tennis team. .

“Everything is falling in place,” beamed the
secondary education major. “The job is terrific
and if I do well I’ll stay permanently. I’m hap-
py about playing number one and my average
even hit 3.0”. ‘

Schwartz missed a year of competition due to
mononucleosis. came home and-transfered to Pitt
due to his illness. “Fran Webster didn’t know
very much about me but I tried out for the team
and made it,” he said.

In the beginning of the season Schwartz play- ,

ed in the third spot and believes that his wind
and stroke have come back since his illness.

“I’ve tried hard this season and gave every
kid a tough fight,” explained Schwartz. “I can
be tough to beat on a slow hard true (clay)
court.”

The top Panther player, who has in the past
made the semi-finals in the North Park tourna-
ment, the third round in the Western Pennsyl-
vania competition, and finals in the South Park
tournament, believes that the key to winning is
determination and being psyched for a match.

“If you don’t worry how good you look. and
just enjoy the game concentrating on every
shot and placing it, you can win.”

Tennis is to Schwartz strenuous exercise, a‘
fun sport, and a way to enjoy life. He views his

invitation ‘to play ,.on the NIT team not only as _

Mitters’ Crusade:
DH With Penn State

By JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Unlike the Panther

but in Penn State.

When the mitters play the Nit-
tany Lions it’s something spe-
cial. “It’s not a game.” related
Pitt‘s coach Bob Lewis. “It's a

crusade.”

The Panthers will go crusad-
ing this Saturday as they travel
to Penn State to face the Lions

in a doubleheader.

Penn State has racked up a
10-4 season record, beating such
teams as Bucknell, Temple, and
Villanova. This record does not
a Southern Tour in
- which the Lions compiled a 1-5

include

record. .

Coach Chuck Medlar is get-
ting good pitching and hitting

from his Nittany Lion team.

Top hurlers, and possible start-

ers in Saturday’s doubleheader,
are team captain Roy Swanson

and Jim Conroy. Swanson, who
finished last season with a 4-4

record and an earned run average
of 1.48, is now 4-2 on the sea-
son with an ERA of 1.13.

The Panther baseball team
upped their record to 17-6
Wednesday afternoon with a
double victory over Indiana
State of Pennsylvania.

In the opener, the team gave
pitcher Rich Muse an 8-0 lead
going into the final inning, but

he needed help from Frank
Mincarelli to halt a 4 run In-
diana rally. The mitters came
up with three in the ninth to
edge the Indians 85, after blow-
ing a nearly 5-4 lead in the sec-
ond game.

er mitters find their big rival

Switches to outfield.

Conroy pitched his way to a
3-2 record last year with a 1.71
ERA. This season he stands at
3-2 with an ERA of 1.46..

Rounding out the Lions three
pitchers of record is Rick Sher-
kel now boasting a 3-0 record
and an ERA of 0.87.

All together, the Nittany Lion’s
team ERA is 1.44.
Mark Tanner, first baseman

and lefthanded batter, leads Penn
State in the hitting department.

Six Mitters Chosen
For All-Star Contest

Anyone who hasn’t gone to Three-Rivers Stadium because of
high prices has a golden opportunity to see the Stadium and an all-

star baseball game this Sunday afternoon at 1:30 for only one doll-E

ar.

The game is sponsored by the 'I‘ri-State Coaches Association
and will feature all-stars from local colleges competing in the an-

nual North-South game.

Seating in the park is on a
first serve basis. All seats will
be available for spectators.

Six mitters from the Panther
baseball squad will be members
of the North team. Catcher Guy
Caparelli, first baseman Ken
Macha, second baseman Bob
Livingston, shortstop Terry
Stokes, outfielder Bob Solonick-
ne, and pitcher Mike Niccols

schedule. we can’t afford to
lose six games.”

Freshman Rea Tops

M Stadium Jump Mark

by JERRY MYERS
Sports Editor
When a freshman reaches the status of being a varsity athlete.
his main concerns are usually integrating himself into the team and
improving on the special skills that qualify himself for the sport

in the first place.

For Bill Rea things extend past those basic criteria as he sets
his sights on things like. the NCAA‘s and ultimately the Olympics.

"I'm going to go to the Olym-
pics in Munich in ‘72 whether
I'm on. the team or not.“ con-
fides Rea. a native of Austria.
“But I‘m planning to be on it."
One big reason for wanting
to return to Europe is that his
grandmother lives in Europe, but

Rea’s ambitions reach past that-

single motive.

On Tuesday. at the Pitt-Tem-
ple outdoor track meet. Rea’s
chances of becoming a member
of the ’72 Olympic team were
put in a more realistic light.
With his record breaking jump
of 25 feet 7 inches in the long
jump. the graduate of Elizabeth
Forward High School in Eliza-
beth. Pa.. qualified for the Olym-
pic trials. The qualifying mark
is 25 feet 3 inches.

Warm weather and spring
breezes must agree with Rea.
His record breaking jump. dur-
ing Tuesday’s 80 degree heat
wave, surpassed his previous
longest jump by a full foot and
ahalf.

“This was the first good day
I've had. The weather was good
and everything else was good
too,” commented Rea after the
jump.

In his first year at Pitt. Rea
is already a veteran of indoor
track at the school. Training un-
der the now graduated, Bryant
Salter. Rea appears to have
found the key to a successful
track career. He competed in
the long jump during the win-
ter season.

Rea, a versatile competitor also
won the triple jump in Tues-
day's meet with a spring of 48
feet 81/2 inches.

Bill describes the exhilerating
feeling of soaring almost 26
feet in the air with a single
leap by saying. “I felt like a
bird today."

It’s 89 ways better than a Volkswagen.

The car you see before you has almost twice
as much trunk space as the Volkswagen Beetle.
lt gives you a smoother ride and a shotler turn-

ing radius than the Beetle.

lt even has a longer lasting, more powerful en-

gine than the Beetle.

All told, this car has 89 things you've never

seen inside the Beetle.

ln fact, it's so superior to the Beetle, we couldn't

call it the Beetle anymore.

So we gave this car, whose mild-mannered ex.
terior masks its true identity, a new name,
We call it SUPER BEETLE. '

 Elected MVP

byGEARY JOHNS

Most young college students
wouldn’t dream of becoming the
number one man and captain of
a sport. the Eastern champ in
that sport. then becoming the
NCAA champ and finally. mak-
ing it as a professional in that
sport. But then most college
students aren‘_t Steve Kosalac.

Steve. a freshman majoring in
Engineering, did not come to
Pitt because of the golf scholar-
ship he was offered. The money
situation was secondary because.
even with a partial scholarships
from the schools he applied to.
he would still be paying more
than he would have if he had
come to Pitt. The Pitt scholar-
ship was small incentive as com-
pared to the tuitions of the other
schools.

Steve. who is called the Snake
Killer. because he looks like he is
killing snakes when he hits the
ball says. “I had offers from a
few Southern schools. but I
would have had to pay a lot of
money myself, more than I would
pay going to Pitt."

“I wrote a couple of letters
to Coach Peery but I never got
any replies. That got me mad.
I didn’t know whether to go
south or try my luck here. But
the price decided it.”

When he says that golf is a
young man's game. he really
means it. A self—taught player.
Steve began his career at the
age of 11. At Bethel Park High.
he was team captain and first
man for all four years.

Playing unattached. but oc-
cassionally out of South Park
Golf Course. he has had a few
championships to boast about.

’l‘hursda_v, May 20, 197i—'rHi«:

 

Kosalac Keeps Hopes
High For Golf Future

“I‘ve qualified for the National
Publinks Championship. won a
few Chamber of Conference
tournaments and a couple of Ju-
nior tournaments."

The person who gets the most
excitement from his play is not
Steve but his mother. “She real-
ly gets a kick out of seeing my
name in the papers.” .

Steve. a zero handicapper. is
enthusiastically looking forward
to next season. He figures he
can become the number one man
on the team and then hopes to
become team captain.

“I’ll never become captain
while the older guys are on the
team. Most of them leave after
next year and then I have a
good chance to become captain."

He also hopes to become the

Eastern champion and then, the
NCAA champion. “I want to
become the NCAA champ. I
want to be known as the best
college golfer in the nation.” .

His final ambition. as he states
it. “I » want a PGA card. I
don‘t think there is any golfer
around who doesn’t want to be-
come a pro and go on tour.”

One of Steve’s many accom-
plishments this year was being
named MVP of the golf team.
“I was really pleased in being
selected. You know. the players
vote for that themselves. I didn’t
reallyhave fantastic scores but
I always came through in the
clutch.”

Finishing as top golfer with a
6-2-2 record. Steve‘s goals may
be closer than he thinks.
