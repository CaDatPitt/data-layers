Inquiry Group To Circulate
Inquiry Forum News
On Campus Today

One of the leaders in labor’s ﬁght
for organization, Philip Murray, will
speak before Inquiry Forum today on
the subject, “Labor and the CIO.”
The meeting will be held in R0-om
107, Alumni Hall, at 12:30 o’cl-ock.

Mr. Murray is chairman of the
Steel Workers’ Organizing Commit-
tee and International vice president
of the Unit-ed Mine Workers of
America. At the present time, he is
campaigning for the election of Presi-
dent Roosevelt.

The SWOC chairman is one of the
chief lieutenants of John L. Lewis in
the drive of the Committee for In-
dustrial Organization to univonize
along industrial union lines the work-
ers in steel, rubber, automobile, and
several othe'r m-ass-producti-on indus-
tries. Representing the insurgent
CIO labor group he will discuss the
phases of labor’s internal strife and
its position in the election campaign.

Mr. Murray was active in govern-
mental affairs during the past ad-
ministration, being a member of both
the National Industrial Recovery
Board and the NRA Advisory Coun-
cil. He has been a member of the
Board of Education in Pittsburgh
since 1918, and vice president of the
miners’ union since 1920. ,

Inquiry Forum will set a prece-
dent today by putting out the ﬁrst
issue of “Inquiry Forum News.”
Copies of the paper will be distribut-
ed during the ﬁrst, second, third, and
fourth hours on the campus.

Ducks And Dukes
Have Their Day

Nightriders Upset Panthers
For First Victory. 7-0

By Shorty Long

Saturday was a swell day for
ducks and Dukes!

Through sloshing, oozing mud and
drenching rain plodded and galloped
an inspired, great red and blue-clad
outﬁt from Duquesne University to
score a major upset in football his-
tory by outplaying the famed Golden
Panthers of Pitt, 7-0, in the Stadium.

The major gallop of the game be-
longs to George Matsik, of Ambridge,
who broke through his left tackle in
the second quarter to race for the
ﬁrst touchdown the Bluﬁites have
ever scored on any Pitt team, and
the touchdown that gave them their
well-deserved victory over the Blue
and Gold corps.

Duquesne students and fans went
wild as Matsik tore down the ﬁeld,
bowling over and evading the frantic
Pitt tacklers. Umbrellas, hats, rain-
coats, newspapers, programs, blank-
ets, and whatnot sailed with joyous
abandon into the dark, misty sky.
The bedlum grew as Brumbaugh
booted the point after touchdown.

Later in the period the Dukes
again got their mitts up with a ﬁrst
down on three line plays and then
another on a 17-yard ﬂight around
end by Beto Vairo, who left the hos-
pital to play in the game. Vairo
quick-kicked to the Pitt three-yard
stripe, but a 15-yard penalty gave the
Panthers a break and Vairo’s punt
was picked up by Bob LaRue on his
own 16.

Failing on their attack, Stapulis’
punt was a quick one and Brumbaugh
whipped up to the Pitt 30 with it.
The Dukes got a ﬁrst down on the
Panther 19 and Pitt was in a really
tackle-ish situation until Johnny
Karrs, Dukes fullback, fumbled dur-
ing the scrimmage and Hoffman re-

Pitt Observes
Blue Monday!

About all the consolation Pitt
can muster up today, in regard to
Saturday’s stunning defeat, is the
realization that SFA’s student
cheering bl-ock withstood all sorts
of weather handicaps to show the
Pittsburgh district that the stu-
dents of this University have some-
thing besides a ﬁghting football
team on fall Saturday’s.

It was heart-breaking, the Dukes’
7-0 victory, coming one week after
that ﬁne power display at Colum-
bus. It’s still a bit early to be
making predictions, but we think
Dr. Sutherland’s squad will come
back ﬁghting, and will go on to
have one of the greatest football
teams in the country.

Pitt passed, attempting to score,
for the ﬁrst time this season, and
several times it looked like suc-
cess. Basrak probably made All-
American at the Panthers’ expense,
but ahead of him we would nomi-
nate Boyd Brumbaugh as one of
the hardest running, and best de-
fensive backs in the country.

‘Cock Robin’

To Be Given
By Players

Murder Mystery Postponed
After Flood In Spring
Revived By Group

Not to be frustrated permanently
by the mere overﬂowing of three
mighty rivers, Pitt Players, whose
production of “Cock Robin” was post-
poned, and eventually abandoned last
year because of the St. Patrick's Day
ﬂood on March 17, will present the
Rice-Barry murder mystery Wednes-
day and Thursday of this week in the
Pittsburgh Playhouse on Craft Ave-
nue.

“Cock Robin” is constructed on the
“play-within-a-play” principle. Re-
hearsal by the Cope Valley Commu-
nity Players of a duel scene in a
nameless medieval romance consti-
tutes the ﬁrst act of the show, an act
in which strong antagonisms are re-
vealed, and motives are suggested for
the approaching murder.

George McAuliﬂ‘e is a hard-boiled
director, a professional hired by the
gentry of Cope Valley. He is direct-
ing the annual beneﬁt held for the
propagation of trees on the local hos-
pital lawn. McAulifl'e is rough and
tough and cynical. The part will be
played by Joseph Letteriello, C39.

Everybody hates Hancock Robin-
son, the man who gets killed. In ad-
dition to having nefarious designs on
one of the town belles, there are at
least a dozen other reasons why he
should be the butt of homicidal pas-
sions. Oscar Goodstein, C39, will
play Robinson.

Julian Cleveland is a digniﬁed, mid-
dle-aged lawyer, a business partner

Law School Students Cast
Largest Republican Vote
In Student Balloting

By William Stark

With complete returns available in
The News presidential poll, con-
ducted in collaboration with The
Pittsburgh Press and “America
Speaks,” President Rosevelt is a
“sure” winner as far as undergradu-
ate opini-on is concerned, if cross-
section surveys mean anything.

The President received 63.1 per
cent of all the votes cast in the pres-
ent poll; Governor Landon had 29.2
per cent; Norman Thomas had 4.4
per cent; and all other candidates
had 4.3 per cent.

Roosevelt polled 65.6 per cent of
the votes cast by the freshman class;
67.6 per cent in the sophomore class;
62.7 per cent in the junior class; and
51.8 per cent in the senior class.
Governor Landon polled 28.6, 24.4,
33.5, and 33.2 per cent in the fresh-
man, sophomore, junior, and senior
classes respectively.

Norman Thomas had 3.3 per cent
in the freshman class, 4.0 per cent
in the sophomore class, 1.9 per cent
in the junior class, and nine per cent
in the senior class.

Students in the School of Business
Administration gave President Roose-
velt 73 per cent of its votes. Gov-
ernor Landon polled 62 per cent of
the votes in the School of Medicine.
The School of Engineering and
Mines are split evenly between Gov-
ernor Landon, and the President.
Students in the School of Education
were almost unanimous for Roosevelt.

Both male and female students in
the College gave President Roosevelt
73 per cent of its votes, which repre-
sents an advance of 5.9 per cent over
the 1932 ﬁgures. Roosevelt polled
67.1 per cent in 1932, Hoover had
26.6 per cent, and Norman Thomas
had 6.3 per cent.

Of all students voting, 27 per cent
were of voting age. All results are
based on a sampling of ten per cent
of the undergraduate body.

Students in the School of Law
favor the President, indicated by
their casting 54 per cent for him,
against 45 per cent for Governor
Landon.

About Perfect!

School Hits Peak In
Finding Jobs

After gradually increasing for the
last ﬁve years, the percentage of
placement among the graduates of
the School of Engineering and Mines
reached an almost perfect peak when
113 of the 117 graduates of the 1936
class were holding positions in their
respective ﬁelds only two months
after graduation.

No other school in the country sur-
passed the percentage, which was a
decided improvement over previous
years at the University. In 1932,
at the peak of the depression, few
of the graduates could ﬁnd work.
Through the succeeding years the
number increased until, in 1935, 70
per cent of the graduates were placed.
However, it was not until this year
that the percentage reached 96 per
cent.

Petroleum engineering graduates
are placed the fartherest away, some
of them working in South America.
Electrical and chemical engineers can
now be found with such concerns as
the Bell Telephone Company and the
Du Pont laboratories. Most of the
mining graduates have found posi-
tions with Pennsylvania mining com-
panies, while the metallurgical stu-
dents are located in the local iron
and steel industries.

Civil engineering graduates are en-
gaged in construction work through-
out the country, while industrial and

mechanical engineers are working in
their own ﬁelds.

PM] To Open Season
On Thursday Evening'

Robert Owrey, baritone, and Helen
Young, soprano, will begin the 1936-
37 season of the Pittsburgh Musical
Institute with a song recital Thurs-
day evening at 8:30 o’clock in the
Institute recital room, 131 Belleﬁeld
Avenue. Marion Bollinger will ac-
company them at the piano.

Modern and classical songs com-
prise the program. No tickets are
needed and the public is cordially in-
vited to attend.

Language Fraternity
Will Hear Lohstoeter

Frederick Lohstoeter will speak at
the ﬁrst dinner meeting of Sigma
Kappa Phi, honorary foreign lan-
guage fraternity, tomorrow evening,
in the University Cafeteria.

Mr. Lohstoeter is speaking in place
of his wife, Dr. Lotte Lohstoeter,
assistant professor of modern lan-
guages, who will be unable to attend
the dinner because of her appoint-
ment to SFA Council.

A book by Andre Tardieu, former
premier of France, will be discussed
by Mr. Lohstoeter. The book, “Le
Souverain Captil,” reviews the pres-
ent economic and political situation in
France.

Jfessor of modern languages, will re-
place Miss Theresa Kahn, instructor
in English and coach of the Women’s
Debating Association, who has re-
signed.

Another change in faculty mem-
bership in the Association concerns
the replacement of Captain Donald
Tredennick, professor of military
science, who left the University at
the beginning of the school year to
assume a post at Fort Hannock in
New Jersey. Captain Tredennick will
be replaced by Dr. John McParland,
instructor in dental pathology. Dr.
McParland was president of Student
Council, Student Faculty Associ-
ation’s predecessor, three years ago.
as a ﬁfth-year dental student. He
is also a past president of Psi Omega,
social fraternity in the School of
Dentistry. Dr. McParland is the son
of Dr. P. V. McParland, associate
professor of operative dentistry.

The Assembly is scheduled to pass
on the action of the executive com-
mittee and its work in relation to the
16 committee reports which the lat-
ter body has been hearing at its past
few meetings.

The Assembly will probably con-
ﬁrm the appointment of Ernest Rose,

Just Not Our Day

HEN the Duquesne celebrators hit campus today, let them

have their fun. It is their day. After all, it is the dawn

of a new day for Duquesne football. It is the ﬁrst major upset vic-

tory for the Night-riders, a team that has been in the habit of

scoring miracle victories, but previously only over teams like the

Haskell Indians, West Virginia Wesleyan, Geneva, and even
George Washington.

Today they are City Champions. Had Pitt won there would
have been no celebration. However, the Dukes scored, and upset,
or at least temporarily derailed, the Rose Bowl Express—so
there you are.

Students are still strongly backing the Sutherland squad.
Saturday’s defeat can be best explained as just “one of those things
that couldn’t happen.” Pitt was ﬂ.ush from the Ohio State victory.
That Columbus affair took much drive from the legs of the Pitt
men, and probably the best explanation could be found by exam-
ining the turf of the Ohio State ﬁeld. Physically the boys absorbed
such terriﬁc punishment one week ago, that against the smashing
Dukes the portions stung “double.”

Although even tougher tests than the “Night-rider Mirage”
are yet in store for Dr. Sutherland, students at this University
know that Pitt football will come back, probably reaching greater
heights than before. Pitt football is still great.

First Down, Four Years To Go

S ILENCE IS GOLDEN for some days now. With the close of

rushing at approximately two o’clock Sunday morning, came
the return of most fraternity men to class. They can be normal
once more, but freshmen will ﬁnd it difficult to forget the bright
splotches for some time yet. For the freshman is the one who must
decide ﬁrst if he wants membership, then next, if he can afford it.

In all fraternities the situation is a cooperative one. True,
some may be more efficiently managed, better organized, or longer
established than some of the others. However, the thing is rela-
tively true that in any of these groups the freshman will receive
only as he gives. This goes for time, attitude, effort and money.
None of the houses “jack up” their various assessments and
charges, for by so doing they only make it expensive for them-
selves. They handle it as reasonably as possible.

This can be best illustrated by examining the Cooperative
Buying Association, an organization to lower, especially, the cost
of food. Most chapters also sponsor Mothers’ Clubs, beneﬁt and
social organizations that aid the respective groups in the purchase
of furniture and interior decoration. The plan is cooperative.

The common and misused question, “But what does a frater-
nity give you?” is usually asked before a boy considers pledging.
Often the pledgee would do better if he asked himself that very
question after he has pledged. For a fraternity offers nothing to
a person with that attitude, or a similar one, “Am I getting my
money’s worth?” Money merely provides the opportunity to re-
ceive some worth—while things from a group of this sort. You can
meet people, know them well, conﬁde in them, without belonging
to any Greek house. A fraternity is merely the crystallization of
associations.

An lmportant Angle
You like to climb to the top of a high hill. You are alone, and
it seems free and airy. The sun is bright and warm. You like
the ﬂeecy whiteness of the clouds. But here you stop. Your
climb has been long and steep, but what do you ﬁnd as you stand
there alone? The shape of that cloud to the west takes you to

. the corner store, where Bill spears a big, green pickle from the

jar in the corner. Another looks like a Pitt line engulfing the
charging backs from South Bend.

The sun is still warm, but now you want to sit down and talk
it over with someone. Perhaps that biggest ﬂeecy one looks more
like a history professor spread over the top of his desk than a
Pitt lineman. Someone may be able to convince you of that. But
you can never quite discover that alone.

At a metropolitan University such as this, sometimes we forget
that a fraternity does these things. Sometimes we do not realize
that they are being done every day. You do not have to climb to
the top of a hill to watch them. Joan’s smile is bright and con-
tagious, not only because you have watched it, but because Ed
and Don both agreed that it was bright and contagious. Pitt's
defeat is “awful” until Mike agrees that it is equally “awful” and
then suddenly you agree it is glorious to lose, sometimes. There
is, after all, very little that can be done, regardless of your theories
and diagnoses.

Some of the other phases of a fraternity—the ballyhooed, dis-
tinctive, sensational, famous and infamous ones——are well known
to at least most college students, and do not have a very deﬁnite
place. True, they do seem to monopolize the scene, but not so
much as most people would believe. That is the reason many
fraternity men are at a loss when asked to justify their existence.
Usually they unconsciously use a ﬂowery tirade that has their own
particular group, at least, on the threshold of brotherly immortality
and good will. The view from the top-of-the-hill angle is diffi-
cult to explain. But it is there, and as soon as many fraternity
men shift a bit more of their emphasis to this, the sooner they
will be able to give more rational explanations for existence.

The opportunity is there; but a fraternity only gives to those
who want to receive, and are willing to put out some effort to get it.
Many things are there to be “got.” The dues are merely “stock”
in the fraternity corporation. In this corporation it is strangely
up to the stockholders to declare their own dividends. The income
on tli.“ "“"estment may be great, or little, depending on the effort.

Diary Revealed As Evidence
  In IF Council, Rushee’s Case

Greek Supervising Body,
Standing On Ceremony,
Heckles Freshman

Immediately after the open season
for rushing ended on Sunday morn-
ing at 2 o’clock, Interfraternity Coun-
cil, it is rumored, brought suit
against a freshman for breach of con-
tract. The Council is said to contend
that the freshman, whose name is,
withheld because of his age, virtually
agreed to sign up with one of its
member fraternitie_s, but that after
feeds and dances and general mer-
riment, he reneged.

Determined to stamp out this mali-
cious practice, which for years has
set the houses back plenty, the plain-
tiﬁ’ has produced the following diary,
which will be exhibited in court after
the precedent set by the Affair Astor:

“Monday—Three frat men got me
in a corner at 8:30. I escaped and hid
under the prof’s lecture stand. He
came in and they invited him to
lunch. He refused, because he was a
Phi Beta Kappa. They tried to get
him to depledge. Then they saw me
and I accepted because I hadn’t eaten
for three days. By fourth hour, col-
lected bids for 3 lunches, 5 dinners,
10 house dances, and my athletic
book.

“Had tough time ﬁnding the house.

Seidle Speaks

“Industrial Vocations” was the
subject of a talk given by N. Robert
Seidle, head of the University Place-
ment Bureau, at the IE Seminar,
Thursday, October 15, in Room 204,
Cathedral.

One Of Two Manuscripts Submitted

To Be Selected .

The book of the 1937 Cap and
Gown show will probably be chosen
from the two scripts submitted to the
Graduate Club production committee,
according to Theodore W. Biddle, as-
sistant to the dean of men and sec-
retary of the club.

For Cap And Gown

nos, C38, and Robert Saffron, C38,
and is entitled “You Gotta Sell the
Women.”

Mr. Biddle asks that all music and
lyrics be submitted before the end
of this month.

At the present time the stories are:
being read by G. Norman Reis, Louisf
Fushan, Dr. Francis Brantlinger, and
Mr. Biddle, all of the graduate com--
mittee. One, entitled “The Cat’s-
Meow,” is written by two sophomores
in the College, William Colker and;
Sydney Shore. The other is by the!
authors of last year’s show, Nick Spa-I

Sutherland Entry ‘Eliminated
In Outstanding Grid Casualty

Clipper Smith And His Bluffmen Strike While The I.ron
_Is Hot, Take Advantage Of Breaks To Defeat
Panther Eleven—And Confound ‘Experts’

Clipper Smith is feeling chipper tonight. And he has every

right and some lefts for feeling so.

Clipper, th'e chipper, is head

coach of the Duquesne Dukes’ ﬁghting football team and it seems
that his team won a game last Saturday over here on the Panther

settlement, the Stadium.

In fact, Clipper the chipper’s outﬁt pulled the biggest upset
in the city’s history when his Dukes fought off Panther after

Panther rally to wind up out :’front,<=>

7-0, in a game that dripped with
mud and rain, 25,000 drenched fans,
and great Panther disappointment.
The Panther fo-otballers and the Pan-
ther followers were really upset after
the Duquesne “Blac‘vk Plague” had
«done it’s damage.

Bjefnorue the game only the most
rabid of Duke foll-owers disagre-ed
with the S'in'elair Lewis ‘idea, “It can’t
happen here.” Two hours later only
the most rabid of Seagram swallow-
vers wer-en’t convinced that it did
happen here and that the Dukes really
did it. The defeat was the Pan-
thers’ first of the 1935 season and
the ‘first in the three-game series
with ‘the Duquesne Night Riders.

First Downs, ll-3, Pitt!

Although outnumbered in ﬁrst
«downs, 11 to 3, the Dukes, led by
Brumlbaugh, Matsik, and Basrak,
‘played their cards right. They fought
hard, managed to shake_loose George
Matsik for a 72-yard touchdown
jaunt in the secon-d quarter, and then
settled down to hold that Panther.
And they di-d all of that.

?P.itt"s play was .
ragged. Time and
time again th e
Panthers seemed
on their way to
make Clipper feel
not so chipper only
to have the Piower
punch they showed
so effectively last
week against Ohio
State weake-n and
frizzle up. The
team that so con-
vincingly trounced
the Buckeyes last
week just wasn’t on the ﬁeld against
those Dukes last Saturday.

Early in the ﬁrst quarter the Pan-
thers l-ooked good when they took the
ball featured by two runs, one of 11
yards, one of 14, by Marshall Gold-
berg, down to the Dukes’ 13-yard
line. Then, someone turned off the
power. Late in the second quarter,
the Pitt powerhouse started moving
once more, this time reaching the
Duquesne six-yard line, ﬁrst and goal.
But once m-ore the spark failed, and
Malarkey fumbled on the two-yard
line.

Panthers Threaten Often

And so it Was during the whole
game. The Panthers were just like
the weather, except that the weather
threatened, then really did do some-
thing, while the Panthers only
threatened. Frequent fumbles and
pass interceptions were the Panthers’
greatest drawbacks, in addition to
the loss of power in their attack and
defense.

Matsik’s touchdown run in the mid-
dle of the second quarter came as a
complete surprise. The Dukes were
down on their own 20-yard line.
Matsik had substituted for Vairo just
on-e play before. Brumbaugh, who
played a bang-up game all the way
through, and ranks with the best
ball-carriers seen in the Stadium,
pounded twice at the Pitt line for a
total of eight yards.

Matsik then took the ball for the
first time that afternoon. Running
to the left, Matsik cut inside the
Panther right end, traveled 15 yards
straight down ﬁeld, and then raced
towards the side-line and the Pitt
;goal-line. Easily ﬁve Panthers had
opportunities to smear the run with
Daddio and LaRue chasing the Duke
all the way down to the 10-yard line.

With the run Went the game; it
just about blew Panther hopes of a
Rose Bowl team. It was : tough
_g:am.e for Sutherland and his squad
to lose, but there are ﬁve games re-

maining to rebuild Pitt glory.
Picking individual stars in the
Pitt-Duqu-esne struggle is like pick-
ing up a corner of the Cathedral.
It’s tough. The entire Duquesn-e
team played heads-up ball with Boyd
Brumbaugh outstanding. Brumbaugh
was a deﬁnite threat to the Panthers
all afternoon. Mike Basrak, Duke

‘center and captain, lived up to all

the nice things said about him and
played great defensive ball. Matsik
had just one run, but that was
enough.

Over on the Pitt side the “Black
Plague” really hit the Panthers’ row
of individual s-tars. The entire Pan-
ther team played hard but not good
enough. Marshall Goldberg contin-

ued his streak -of brilliant playing.
with runs of 11, 13, 14, and 26 yards9

Feely Announces
Intramural Rules
For Coming Year

 

=Intercollegiate Regulations
Used For All Contests;
Eligibility Stressed

Although the round robin touch
football schedule is not yet completed,
Martin Feely, director of intramural
athletics, has announced the rules
that will govern the formation of all
intramural games.

The six rules of ‘intramural sports
‘follow:

1. Only registered undergraduate
1 students carrying at least twelve cred-
its will be eligible to participate. How-
ever, no member of any varsity team
is eligible to play on any of these
teams during the time that the varsity
squad is practicing, or if he has
earned ‘a letter "in that particular
-sport.

2. Teams wishing to postpone their
game must give 48 hours notice with
a legitimate excuse. Any team that
fails to play a scheduled game will
be ﬁned one dollar and forfeiture of
the game. Formal withdrawal from
the league must be made a week in
advance to ‘become effective.

3. The intramural games will be
played according to the intercollegiate
rules for sport. Special additions and
rulings will ‘be made to ﬁt individual
sports needs at the University. Mr.
Feely will make all decisions in re-
gards to the appointment of officials
and eligibility.

4. Winners in each league shall be
determined by percentage of games
won. In case a team withdraws from
the league all games will be consid-
ered forfeited. Teams must be ready
to play within ten minutes of start-
ing ‘time. The official in charge of
» the game has power to declare a for-
feit in event of unnecessary or in-
tentional delay in starting the game.

5. All protests concerning games
must be presented at the Trees Gym
office within 24 hours after the game
has been played. In questions of fact
and happenings in -a game the offi-
cial’s decision will be ﬁnal. Protests
will be considered only on questions
of interpretation of rules. Such pro-
tests will be considered only where
the points under protest would mate-
rially affect the outcome of the game.

6. The health of each player must
be certiﬁed by the student health de-
partment. An entrance fee of one
dollar is required for each team.

Skibo Plebes Down Pitt F rosh
Aﬂlid Rain. Mud In 7-0 Battle

By Charles Lynch

Panther ' Cubs and Tech Plebes
sloshed through a sea of mud at the
Tartan bowl Saturday morning and
for the second straight year the
Skibos proved to be the best mud-
ders, getting seven more sjcoreb-oard
decorations than the Pitt yearlings.
Last year a ﬁeld goal by "Lee gave
the Techs a 3-0 Win.

Mud didn’t seem to bother the
Tech freshies during the ﬁrst quar-
ter when they ‘ploughed into Pitt ter-
ritory on the strength of three
straight ﬁrst downs, After this dis-
play of power, however, the Little
Panthers got into the offensive swing
and from then on both teams re-
sorted to hitting the line hard, and
often.

Although Pitt had more scoring
opportunities, the Tartans managed
to capitalize on their only real scor-
lng chance in the second quarter.
Carnegie gained possession of the ball
when Kish fumbled the slimy pigskin
on an attempted punt, recovere-d, but
lost the ball on downs.

After a, preliminary stab at the
lid?’ Cpntlit, Tech halfback, slid
through right tackle and scored
standing up after a 20-yard jaunt.
He also kicked the extra point from
placement, making the score 7-0.

The only scoring threats to follow

Condit’s run were made by the little
Panthers. They were able to move in-
side of the Tech twenty-yard stripe
twice in the last half, once by block-

ing a punt and once when they were
able to put together two ﬁrst downs.
But both efforts to reach pay dirt
were nulliﬁed by the ankle-deep mud
and the ability of the Tartan defense
to tighten when the occasion de-
manded.

Individual honors were grabbed by
the rival quarterbacks. In addition to
his backing-up-the-line duties, Kish,
Pitt signal-caller kept the Tech yearl-
ings back on their heels with his ac-
curate booting of the soggy ball.
Duns, the Tech ﬁeld-general, featured
Wltll brilliant 1"11nning', and savage
blocking.

Rugged line play held both teams
in check, the ﬁrst d-own chart giving
ﬁve to Pitt and four to Tech. Etze,
who backed up the line with Kish,
and Captain Dickinson, at end, were
standouts in the Pitt line. Gumbert
Hafer. Tech tackle, prevented the
Cub backs from taking any liberties
with his side of the line. The Pitt
freshies showed a big team and with
good defensive possibilities, but it
will take a lot of polishing up by
Coach Milligan to get the offense
clicking for the next game.

By Dave Hamilton

At 2:30 o'clock today Referee Joe
Garcia will blow the whistle, Dr. Carl-
son will release the stopwatch, scor-
ers will make a ﬁnal inspection of

§their pencil points, and the long

awaited novice basketball tournament
will get un-der way on the gym ﬂoor
of the Stadium.

Entrants, although they may have
played varsity ball in high school, will
be truly novices. Varsity men and
potential varsity material of the last
year's frosh quintet are ineligible to
handle a ball in this affair except in
the capacity of officials. The basket-
ball displayed will not always con-
form to the orthodox as set down in
the Spalding Basketball Handbook,
but all of the games are guaranteed
to be packed with enthusiasm.

The teams will be of the pick-up
variety, there being no set teams be-
fore the contests begin. Today Dr.
Carlson will line up the contestants
and, seeing them for the ﬁrst time, he
will attempt to choose squads of
somewhat equal power and ability.
After the teams are chosen the sched-
ule for the tourney will be made out.
All of the games must be played on

Dr. Jennings Leaves
For Research Work

Dr. 0. E. Jennings, head of the
department of biology, left yesterday
for Washington, D. C. While there
Dr. Jennings will do some research
for the Federal Forest Experiment
Station. He is a member of the ad-
visory council.

Last Monday, Earl B. Scott, grad-
uate assistant of the department, left
for Sligo, Pennsylvania. He will be
in charge of the educational work at
the Civilian Conservation Corps camp
there.

Dr. Coleman J. Harris, who re-
ceived his doctor’s degree here last
year, has been appointed professor of
botany at Morris Harvey College in
Charleston, West Virginia.

Dr. Lotte Lohstoeter
To Travel To Georgia
As University Delegate

Representing the University at the
Centennial celebration of Wesleyan
College of Macon, Georgia, next Fri-
day, will be Dr. Lotte Lohstoeter, as-
sistant professor of modern languages.

Dr. Lohstoeter has been asked by
Dr. John G. Bowman, chancellor, to
make the trip. During the centennial
celebra-tion, delegates from the lead-
ing universities of the country will
gather at Wesleyan College to honor
the oldest chartered college for
women.

Several meetings f-or the represent-
atives will be held durin-g the cele-
bration. An academic assembly to
be addressed by Dr. Henry Noble
MacCracken, president of Vassar
College, will climax the meetings. A
banquet in the evening will conclude
the events for the day.

Several Weeks ago Dr. Lohstoeter
represented the University at the
‘Harvard Tercentennial.

Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Fri-
day this week after 2 :30 o’clock. The
team winning the most games will be
awarded a prize and though it has not
been revealed what that prize may be,
Dr. Carlson does say that in former
tourneys the winners -have always
been satisﬁed wtih the awards.

Novice Referees, Too !

Although the entrants are novices,
they will not be allowed to make in-
fractions of the rules because of their
status. Garcia, Zeleznik, and Rad-
vansky, all members of the varsity
quintet, will be the officials of the
tournament. Conceding that they are
novices at officiating they should turn
in commendable jobs as they know
basketball rules and theories as taught
by Dr. Carlson. The stopwatch will
be attended by Carlson and the score-
books by scorers supplied by The
News.

To have a good time is the chief
purpose of the tournament with an
attempt to interest the freshmen in
basketball being the secondary rea-
son. During the entire tournament
good fellowship and clean sport will
be stressed.

The entry blank appearing in The
News today is the ﬁnal one to be pub-
lished. Interested basketball novices

o’clock at Heinz House, accord-
ing to Marion Messer, Ed38, so-
cial chairman at the recent Pan-

As at the High Tea, freshmen will

their senior mentors. ‘ At the end of
the line will be ten upperclass women
to introduce the freshmen to the fra-
ternity women present.

The hostesses are to include ten =

pus.

the ten.

Other features of the reception will
be the same as in previous years. For-
mal invitations will be sent out to all
freshmen designating the time they
are to attend. Because of the large
number of freshmen and in order that
accommodations can be made for all,
they will be received at different in-
tervals. Each invitation Will desig-
nate one of three periods for attend-
ance. These periods will be 8, 18:30,
and 9 o’clock. Every freshman is
asked to come at the time designated
on her invitation.

Formal attire is the accepted dress
to be worn by hostesses as Well as
guests. Wraps are to be checked .in
Alumni Hall.

A conference of all fraternity pres-
idents with the Panhellenic ‘Social

fore the reception. The exact date

‘Cock Robin’

(Continued from Page 1)
of the murdered man, with whom he
was not on good terms. Cleveland
will be played by Charles Blaker,
E37.

Richard Lane is an impetuous
young man, whose lady has repulsed
him for another, and who is continu-
ally drunk as a result thereof. The
lady of his affections is Carlotta, and
the interloper, Robinson. Naturally,
Lane shows a more than mild dislike
for Robinson. Lane will be played
by Arthur Kelley, C37. The ravish-

ing Carlotta will be played by Lea‘

Goldstein, C39.

John Jessup is good-looking and-

ordinary and a very good friend of
Lane.
play the part.

The dupe

is Clark Torrance,

scene of the play-Within-the-play, be-
cause Robinson objects to having a
gun pointed at him by Lane, deposed
lover of Carlotta. When the facti-
tious killing in the duel scene turns
out to be a real murder, it looks bad
for Mr. Torrance. He, too, was known
to dislike Robinson. The role will be
taken by John Glasser, BA38.

Henry Briggs is the stage director,
a timid, earnest young man. Since
he handled the guns that ﬁred the vol-
ley of the King’s henchmen offstage
just three seconds after the duel
shooting, he is also under suspicion.
Meyer Rabinovitz, C38, will play the
part.

Doctor Edward Grace is known
as a kindly, respectable old gentle-
man with a slightly nervous disposi-
tion. When he reveals a strong mo-
tive for killing Robinson, and even
admits he planned to shoot him, only
didn’t, because something which hap-
pened that evening made it unneces-
sary, everyone is ﬁabbergasted.

His reason for wishing to harm
Robinson had to do with the honor
of Carlotta, his niece, who had a mind
and will of her own, and spurned his
advice. Ralph Kessler, C38, will take
the part of Doctor Grace.

Alice Montgomery, a buxom, elder-
ly lady and chairman of the amateur
players, who is thought to be silly, al-
though in a very nice way, will be
portrayed by Helen Ackerman, C38.

Maria Scott, assistant to Director
McAuliffe, is the efficient young spin-
ster type. The lady is remarkable
for her ability to detect minor details.
She leads the Way in solving the

crime. Jeannette Swartz, C38, will
play the role.
Helen Maxwell, a middle—aged

widow, is the mother of Carlotta. She
is worried over her daughter’s infatu-
ation with Robinson; she, too, might
therefore wish his removal. Mary
Virginia Delph, G., will be Mrs. Max-
well.

A pair of white gloves worn by the
murdered man is the chief clue to the
solution of the crime.

Dr. Gabbert Speaks

Dr. Mont C. Gabbert, head of the
philosophy department, was one of

Social Workers Club of Allegheny

Exaggerated Panther
Appears Wednesday

Slightly exaggerated, as is be-
ﬁtting a political issue, the Pitt
Panther appears Wednesday as a
32—page number instead of 28
pages . . . for the same price.

Heading the list of feature
writers is Coach “Jock” Suther-
land, who tells about “The Team
We Have.” R. Xavier Graham, in-
structor in journalism, discloses
the results of some research in
Football, Then, Now—and How.”
Student contributors are John
Martinco, C39, with “Politics and
Lather,” and Robert Saffron, C38,
with “Life Begins for ’40.”

And that’s not all. The results of
the recent Panther Poll will be
revealed, showing the presidential
preferences of students by school,
age, cl-ass, and sex. And there will
be the usual “new” cover idea, and
scads of cartoons an-d jokes.

“This is a terriﬁc issue,” says
Miss Irene Matveak, Ed37.

Tell Of Berlin Victory

University Track Coach Explains To Combined Seminar
How Woodruff Conserved Strength In Early Heats;

Saw Other Runners

Crack Up In Finals

By Robert Adams

Johnny Woodruff’s Olympic victory in the 800 meter run was the
result of a carefully planned and well-run race, according to Carl Olson,
University track coach, who featured at the meeting of the combined aero-
nautical and mechanical engineering /Eminar Thursday, with a review of

his trip to the 1936 Olympic games.
“The decision to conserve his ef-

fort in the preliminary heats and

save his power for the ﬁnal one is

what enabled Johnny to come through
with the first American Olympic win
in the 800 meters since 1912,” Coach
Olson stated.

While the other American entries
i : the 800 ran both their preliminary
and semi—ﬁnal heats in fast time,
Woodruff, following Coach Olson’s
plans, ﬁnished third in the preliminary
and ﬁrst in his semi-ﬁnal, but record-
ed slow times in both heats.

Because of the showings made by
Williams, Hornbostel, and Woodruff,
America was believed to have a good
chance to sweep the ﬁrst three places
in the ﬁnal.

For the ﬁnal race, Coach Olson
and Wvoodruff decided that the best
plan would be to stay close behind
Edwards of Canada, veteran of two
other Olympics, who was expected to
set the pace in the ﬁrst half of the
race. Johnny stuck to Edward's heels
for the ﬁrst 600 meters, broke away
from a tight spot when he Wa.s boxed
by three other runners, and passed
Lanzi of Italy in the last 80 meters
to win. Hornbostel and Williams
had evidently run themselves out in
the qualifying heats, for neither one
placed.

'11-. Olson observed that in both
the Los Angeles and Berlin Olympics,
American runners very often made
record times in qualifying heats, but
failed to score in the ﬁnals.

After the Berlin games were over,
Mr. Olson accompanied Johnny to
meets in London, Oslo, and Paris.
Woodruff was voted the most valu-
able man to participate in the Oslo
meet, and the program of the Paris
meet was arranged in his honor.

“As far as I could see,” Mr. Olson
said, “there was no evidence of bad
feeling between the athletes of the
50 nations who participated. All of
the athletes were very friendly with
each other, and exhibited good sports-
manship at all times.”

covered for the Golden Cats on his
own 13.

From then on it was all for the
boys from the Bluff. They made their
touchdown. Later, Brumbaugh fum-
bled a punt on his own 28 and Averill
Daniell recovered the ball. Malarkey
passed to Stebbins and that put the
pigskin on the Dukes’ six-yard line.
But then Malarkey fumbled on an
off-tackle slant and Critchﬁeld recov-
ered for the Dukes on the three-yard
line.

Cheering Block Features

During the intermission between
halves, the new Pitt cheering block
wearing their reversible blue and
gold jackets went through some
maneuvers and had a lot of fun. Both
the Duquesne and Pitt bands maneu-
vered around. Pitt may not have it
all over the Dukes as far as football
is concerned, but believe you me
their band looked slightly fresh out
after our 120 boys with three gaily
dressed drum majors got through with
their spelling lesson down there on
the ﬁeld. However, that is beside the
point.

In the third quarter, the Dukes
just didn't let the Panthers get into
that Ohio State stride. It was a dif-
ferent Pitt team that played there in
that slippery, slidy mud Saturday
from the one that caught the Ohio
State Buckeyes on the chin a week
ago.

Goldberg Runs Again

The fourth period was more or
less of a frying pan for the Panthers.
Nervousness and anxiety made them
fumbly and uncollected. They drove
once from their 20 to the Duquesne
25 where they began an aerial attack
that failed through the interception
of Zopetti by the Dukes. Goldberg
sprinted 25 yards and sidestepped all
but the Duquesne safety man on one
run in that drive. The Dukes took
control from then on and the Pan-
thers cause was lost.

Captain Basrak of the Dukes
played a ﬁne defensive game at cen-
ter. He is being touted for All-Amer-
the whole team played one swell
