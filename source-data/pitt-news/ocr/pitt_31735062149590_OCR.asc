Dr. Farmer to Conduct
Services in Heinz Chapel

Theologian Leads ‘‘

Tri-Weekly Plan
Of Chapel Service

Arrangements for Dr. \Vi11iam
R. Farmer, professor of practical
theology at the VVestern Theologi-
cal Seminar-_v, to conduct services
at Heinz illemorial Chapel have
been completed, announced Rufus
D. Fitzgerald, provost of the Univer-
sity, today.

Chapel programs will be held three
times weekly, beginning Sunday,
February 19. Services will be con-

ducted on Wednesday and Friday
from 1 to 1:25 o’clock. However, be-
cause Wednesday, February 22, is
Washington’s birthday, no service
will be held on that date.

A Chapel choir under the direc-
tion of Theodore M. Finney, director
of Men’s Glee club, together with
Russell W ichmann, University organ-
ist, will provide the music for the
services.

Although Sunday services have
been held for the past few weeks, this
Sunday’s program, beginning with
its prelude by Wichmann at 2:30
o’clock will oﬁicially open the pro-
gram of the University chapel. The

‘processional hymn, immediately be-

fore the worship service, is sched-
uled for 2:45 o’clock.

Dr. Farmer received his Bachelor
of Arts degree at Washington and
Jefferson college in 1892 and went

on to post-braduate work at the Uni- A

versity of Marburg, Germany. A
graduate of the Western Theological
Seminary, he held‘ posts as pastor in
the First Presbyterian church in St.
Paul, Minnesota, and in the Edge-
wood Presbyterian church in Pitts-
burgh. In turn, he became assist-
ant professor at the Western Theo-
logical Seminary, professor, and pro-
fessor of practical theology.
Raymond F. Brittain, instructor in
history and in history of religion,
has charge of the general arrange-
ments for the chapel services.

A g a i 

An Editorial ——-

We Clarity

.HE. proposal to aid student refugees announced recently through
the columns of The News, has stirred up an unexpected storm of

debate.

Heated letters on both sides reach The News daily, sharp

discussions take place before ISFA and other student groups, and a
counter-movement has even been launched.

Much of the controversy, we are convinced, is unnecessary, being
the result of misconceptions and misinterpretations of the nature of

the proposed plan and its workings.

It seems, therefore, both neces-

sary and appropriate, to review the broad aspects of this project, in
the hope that some of these difficulties may be cleared up. First then a

Synopsis:

tims of educational, racial, and

controlled or dominated countries.

The plan, brieﬂy, would call for the sheltering at
the University, of several unfortunate. student vic-

religious persecution in Fascist-

Scholarships, it is hoped, would be, as has been the. case in about
70 schools throughout.‘ the country, offered by the University on the
condition that a committee of students and faculty members raise
the necessary funds for living expenses and make arrangements for

housing, etc.

Should such an arrangement be impossible, the com-

mittee would have to undertake the project alone.
Funds would be secured in a three-cornered drive among students

and student groups, faculty. and interested outsiders.

No general

canvass, on the order of the Community Fund, which is more or less

compulsory, would be held.

All-contributions would be strictly

VOLUNTARY, whether offered by individual contributors or ‘by
student organizations like fraternities, honoraries, student activities,

etc., or by faculty divisions.

A deﬁnite quota, of course, would be set, and, if needs be, un-

derwritten.

The size of this quota, however, would be dependent

upon the amount of cooperation shown by the University in the
matter of scholarships and the expression of student interest.

Details of the drive would be determined and administered by
a committee of student leaders, and an advisory faculty committee.
Approximately 35 students are already members of the general com-
mittee on campus; that committee has already met and has named
a11 executive board of seven members, composed of representatives
from SFA, Panhellenic Council, Interfraternity Council, The News,

and also three members elected at-large from the committee.

The

faculty committee, to be composed of 30 or more members, is now in

the process of formation.

This group, to function as an independent campus activity, would
set its goal, make plans for fund-raising, and be in charge of all sub-

sequent activities.

Once the goal had been reached, the committee,

in conjunction with the University and the Intercollegiate Committee
to Aid Student Refugees would make careful selection from appli-

cants for aid.

The intercollegiate committee is set up to coordinate and extend
the fund raising work being done by colleges and universities through-
out the country. It' has as its sponsors the National Intercollegiate
Christian Council, Federation of Catholic College Students, Inter-

Owl.

The contest will be judged by
Chancellor Bowman, Thomas M.
Jarrett, University photographer,_
and Philip C. Elliott, assistant pro-
fessor of ﬁne arts.

Rules are as follows:

1. Pictures must show student life
on the campus. There are no
other restrictions as to subject.

2. Pictures must be submitted to
Harold Viehman, C39, Owl ed-
itor, on or before March 1, with
proper identiﬁcation. The Owl

ner, but the Owl will not be
responsible for loss or-injury
to any photograph entered.

3. Students may submit one or
two pictures, but no more than
two. Pictures must be printed
to four inches by ﬁve inches or
larger and are not to be
mounted. '

4. The contest is open only to
freshman, sophomore, and jun-
iors.

Women Oppose
Wooster Today

Representatives from Wooster col-
lege will meet three members of the
University Women’s Debating Asso-

United States should form an alli-
ance with Great Britain,’-’ marks the
ﬁrst intercollegiate match of the year
at home.

Lorraine Simpson, C39, Ruth Neh-
er, Ed39, and Margaret Byrne, Ed39,
representing the association, will take

New Women Attend
Pure-Rushing Affair

Plans for the annual Panhellenic
Mass Meeting for freshmen women
and transfer students scheduled for
Monday have been completed, ac-
cording to Dorris Grennan, C40.

Fraternities will officially open
rushing activities Thursday, Mar. 2.

Qualifications for rushing are a
quality point average of 1.5.

Clubs to Hold

Group Parties

ln New Gym

The new \Vomen’s Gymnasium,
located in the. basement of the
Cathedral, will be open for use
Monday, according to Dr. Eliza-
beth Rearick, associate professor
of physical education.

University groups may reserve the
gym for parties and dances on Fri-
day and Saturday evenings and Sat-
urday afternoons. Reservations for

such parties and dances must be
made with Miss Helen Poole Rush,
assistant dean of women, must be
registered in the office of the dean of
women, and must comply with the
regulations of other University so-
cial events.

At no time is food to be served or
eaten in the gymnasium, but the
archery room just off the new gym
may be used for this, according to
Dr. Rearick.

There will be no charge for the use
of the gymnasium unless the ﬂoor is
waxed for dancing; in that case, a
fee will be charged covering cost of
removing of the wax. Permits for
use of the gym may be obtained in
1628 Cathedral from 10 to 12:30
o’clock daily.

Although all major classes and all
women’s classes in physical educa-
tion will be held in the new gym,
any women students in the Univer-
sity may use the gym during the
hours that no regular classes are
scheduled.

Organizations such as WAA, the
freshman women’s sports unit, and
any other group of University wo-
men may secure permission for reg-
ularly scheduled sport or play hours.

Dr. Rearick stated that she is anx-
ious that upperclass women, as well
as freshman women, make use of the
new gymnasium.

Freshmen Fete

freshmen women at a tea yesterday
afternoon, on the twelfth ﬂoor of the

men Council to show their gratitude
for the guidance they received dur-
ing the mentor period. Orientation
teachers were also invited.

among several others; and such individuals as Hon.
Bruce Barton, James Bryant Conant, Dr. Harry
Emerson Fosdick, Henry Noble l\'lacCracken, Rob-

This committee will help the local group in ob-
taining refugces who have superior scholastic qual-
iﬁcations eithcr from those already in this country
or those who have not yet been able to arrive in
this country. The local committee will, then, with
the funds available proceed to make living provi-
sions, and attempt to put the selected students on
their own feet.

The foregoing is the essence of the project; any
further details must await the committee’s action.
However, many misconceptions as to the plan have
arisen. VVe will refer to these point-by-point, in
the hopes that we may be able to clear up some of
the misunderstanding created partly by lack of
information and partly by deliberate misinforma-
tion circulated by loose-lipped opponents.

1 Contrary to the general notio11, no whole-
. sale immigration of refugees is planned. Only
a very limited number of students can possibly be
taken care of; the number would probably range
from two to ﬁve, according to the availability of
funds and administration cooperation. The com-
mittee will, rather than go in for a mass inﬂux,
make sure that those few who will be brought here
will be adequately cared for.
The funds to be provided would 110t be taken
from any source which would deprive worthy
local students of aid. No state funds, obtained
from taxation, would be used, as a vicious rumor
has charged. All money for living expenses and
incidentals would be raised independently and by
voluntary contribution. The only part the Univer-
sity could conceivably play would be to match
contributions with scholarships.
Refugee students would not be brought here
for a four—year “joy-ride.” In the ﬁrst place,
they will all be students who have already had a
certain amount of college education. The responsi-
bility of the committee will be to provide the op-
portunity for them to ﬁnish their training.

Secondly, deﬁnite provision would be made for
only one year. An emergency fund or some simi-
lar device might be set up to provide for later ex-
penses, in case the students are by that time not
self-supporting or are not at least partially pro
vided for by interested groups. '

Future provision, if necessary, will be antici-
pated by making the student committee more or
less a permanent organization which would carry
over from year-to-year just as long as its services
are necessary.

And thirdly every attempt will be made to assist
the students so that they may be “put on their
feet” and become self-supporting or nearly so a.nd
valuable additions to the 1 student body and
community.

4 _The, plan was deﬁnitely not inspired by the
' University administration and, as such, the
University has not committed itself as to its future
policy on the matter. Any University action will
await deﬁnite organization by student groups.
The Pitt News is not the sole sponsor of the
proposed drive. The News, interested from
the start, received appeals from many student and
faculty leaders to support such a project. Conse-
quently, The News has suggested the plan and has
been its most vigorous promoter. But the admin-
istration of the plan is now in the hands of a gen-
eral student committee, a11d an executive board of
seven, on which The News has only one representa-
tive.
The project would be distinctly non—sectarian
in its operation as well as it is in its support
and administration. Students would not be limited
to Germany or Italy or any one locality, race, or
religion. The sponsoring executive connnittee in-
cidentally, includes Protestant, Catholic, and J ew--
ish representation.
Any students, to qualify for scholarships,
would have to be of superior ability, would
have to meet all entrance requirements of the
University as well as any other requirements set up
by the various committees. Thus, only the cream
of the refugee students would be accepted.

Altogether, though the “charity begins at
home” argument has quite logically been raised
against it, the plan, however, seems a necessary
step if present-day conditions are to be alleviated.
The refugees, through no fault of our own, are with
us. \\~'l1eil1er we offer scholarships or not, they will
be here,’ competing for their human share of the
world’s goods.

If this is the case, why not give one or two of
the most outstanding a break, lift them from the
dregs of despair, play our part‘ in assimilating them
into our culture, in making them good Americans.

The problem, as has been charged, is not one of
aliens vs. Americans, or internationalisin vs. nation-
alism.

Pittpourri . . .

By jack Hoeveler

The brewings around these halls during the past few
days have been enough to discourage the strong in heart.
Sir Herbert Ames, speaking on regimentation in an ad-
dress Tuesday was treated to a local display of militar-
ism when in the middle of his talk 52 ROTC boys doing
their Riﬂes roadwcrk marched into the lecture .
the contingent looked like a Phi Ep election turnout.
Dan Cannon playing bridge at the sacred shelter of
DTD got every ace, king, queen, and jack in the deck
except one . . . when his partner laid down the miss-
ing jack, Dan fainted dead away . . . for a little miss-
ing jack I’d do that myself.

I-F Queen Predicted

Lush and lovely Jeanne Oodle, a gal that has trou-
ble with her connotations, has gotten the meaning
across to two late ﬂames, which causes the preﬁx
“late’ to be attached to their names . . . the waiting
line for new applicants reaches from one Commons
Room ﬁreplace to the other. This is a half scoop for
we learn that the I-F Ball Queen will probably be
Ethyl Apter, a Goucher gal who will ﬂy in for the big
affair . . . her papa owns a. candy factory which ac-
counts for the sugar on both sides. Herman Schmidt
has been twoing with Dotty Riseberg, a Duquesne
dramat, formerly the claim of Bill Colker.

The leading campus beauty to whom the Bud Hoff-
man musical hit “Nothing is Too Perfect for You” was
dedicated is Nancy Sundstrom, a freshie of no mean
repute. Jerry “Teeny” Black is phoning early for dance
dates these eves to the B. C. Cohen residence for fear
that Al Raizman will beat him to the draw . . Al is
circulation manager of The News . . . which may have
something to do with it.

Just Stringing Along

Betty Sapp, who isn’t, is up in the stratosphere
over Kal Klippinger . . . he of the Cord convertible

. . her slogan is “I’m not froth.” One of the most
notorious of new wolves on the campus is Bob Stod-
gel, the Peru feather-merchant . . for veriﬁcation
consult his best friend Mel Andrews. Freshman
quarterback Tom Murphy is asking his chums to call
him “Dimples” . . . we may be quoted as saying they
are rare in the backﬁeld though often found in the
line.

Dick Besch, Lambda Chi v—pres., has a little black

“What will I get from ICG?”

This question ﬂies at the campaigning Intercollegiate
Conference on Government delegate. “Is it just an-
other wieek-end away from home?” The questioner may
or may not know that a group from the University goes
to an ICG session at Harrisburg every April, and that
they ﬁnd out how the government is run by actually
participating in the governing processes.

“But won’t I learn just as much from my ﬁrst year
poli sci course?” Now, the ICG idea comes out in its
proper light.

Professors tell us that, of all the ways to learn, the
best is brought about when the student does the thing
which he is trying to understand.

When, in 1934, John Bracken and Genevieve Blatt
sponsored a model state constitutional convention as the
ﬁrst Intercollegiate Conference on Government, they
had this thought in mind.

This is the laboratory of political science; ICG is
a course in itself. Those who wish to learn politics come
to learn its connotations. Those who would know the
workings of their government come to try governing
for themselves.

At the University, John Jones sees on page 346 of
Ogg and Ray’s “Introduction to Political Science” that
the states hold constitutional conventions from time to
time as their civilization advances too far beyond the
government. Jack Doe goes to the ﬁrst ICG session at
Harrisburg. Jack ﬁnds what type of laws are constantly
needing amendment. With a group of 400 or more, he
proposes amendments to the constitution.

John reads again in Ogg and Ray, “Log—rolling is
found continually in the various state legislatures.”
Jack trips down to the ICG legislative assembly in 1935
for an April week—end. That night, the delegate from
Lafayette, who is running for student-chairman, drops
in on Jack and the University representatives at their
hotel room. He wants to know if the delegates from
Pittsburgh would vote for him tomorrow provided he
appoints two of them as parliamentarians for the as-
sembly. Jack’s experience supplements his political
science textbook.

In 1936, the presidential year, John Jones is off to
Harrisburg. He sees what Mr. Ogg and Mr. Ray meant
when they said that delegates to the political conven-
tions trade votes for favors in the process of nominating
a candidate.

University students founded the Intercollegiate Con-

Editor, The Pitt News,
Dear Sir:

The education of the German Ref-
ugees which you have taken upon
your hands is a question of hot de-
bate on this campus. I’d like you to
hear my argument.

I suppose that the instigators of
this drive are smiling smugly and
patting themselves on the back for
advocating this movement. No doubt
they think they are very broadmind-
ed and quite democratic. But they
are not. Even while they preach
against race prejudice, hatred, and
segregation, they are showing par-
tiality. There are many oppressed
groups on the earth today. Why fa-
vor German refugees? What’s their
claim to fame? Why not include a
few Italian refugees from Ethiopia,
or some Spanish Loyalist refugees.
And last but most important, a few
AMERICAN REFUGEES?

If you intend to ask the aid of
every nationality group on this camp-
us to help you with your refugee
movement, don’t you think you’d bet-
ter become more liberal in your ref-
ugee quest and forget about nation-
ality?

Sincerely yours,
NAOMI RAINEY, C41.

May we suggest that reader Rainey
be more careful of her facts.. In fact,
we issue a challenge that she produce
any issue of The News, in which the
project was referred to as one to pro-
vide for “German refugees.”

The object of the proposed drive is
much broader than one nationality
or creed or color. Distinctly non-
sectarian in nature, it will consider
the needs of scholastically superior
students of any nationality group set
adrift by conditions of intolerance.

As such it cannot, without deliber-
ate misinterpretation or distortion, be
considered “partial” or narrow.—The
Editor.

The Question:

What is your opinion of the
SFA policy of showing free
movies?

 

The Answers:

Brooks Sipes, BA39:
I think it has no place in a college.
In the words of Jack Hoeveler, how-

, ever, it might be wise to “sneak” an

industrial movie in
on us.
J 3. c k Cummings,
BA39:
I think it is a
good idea to take

I’d like to see

and “The -Lost
Horizon.”
Clint Sipe, BA39:

the University has made in the past
3 years. I

Rosenberg

Joe Fink, BA39:

I think the project is quite suc-

cessful as was evidenced by the
huge turnouts.

The expenses of showing these
ﬁlms are almost negligible and
therefore an admission charge
would be out of order unless the
proceeds went for so-me good cause.

Freda Jaffe, C41:

32-**

This is, I think, the ﬁrst non-con-
troversial question you have asked.
The free movie policy of SFA is a
grand opportunity for students to
see ﬁlms for the ﬁrst, the second, or
even the third time, provided SFA
keeps up the good work of getting
really outstanding pictures.

Shews lﬂoney Loss
Editor, The Pitt News:

In accordance with the previous
announcement by the Junior Prom
Committee, herewith is a ﬁnancial
statement of the Junior Prom.

We believe that the great social
success of the Prom offsets the ﬁnan-
cial loss of $81.37 and we feel sure

that this will be the concensus among
University students.

The loss can be attributed to the
desire of the Junior Prom Commit-
tee to keep faith with the student
body. The speciﬁc reasons are: 1.
The renting of an additional ball-
room on the day of the dance so that
the dancing would not be crowded;
2. Spending of additional money for
decorations; 3. Buying better pro-
grarn—favors; 4. Unfavorable
weather conditions which prevented
a number of people who had bought
reservation tickets from attending
the dance.

We wish to thank The Pitt News
and Pitt Panther for the publicity
which they gave, and all other or-
ganizations and persons who cooper-
ated in making the Prom a success,
especially Mr. Theodore W. Biddle,
whose guidance proved invaluable.

In conclusion, we again wish to say
that, even with a relatively small ﬁ-
nancial loss, this year’s Junior Prom
was one of the best dances held at
the University.

Sincerely,
EMIL E. NARICK,
on behalf of The Junior Prom
Committee.

Tuesday evening the Craig Street quintet defeated its nearest
rival for the crown, Phi Gamma Delta, 19-12, as Captain Dick Cassiano

player. the leading part.

“Dandy Dick” proved to be the same money ball player on the

basketball court that he was as a¢

member of Dr. Sutherland’s “dream”
backﬁeld. Dick dropped in three ﬁeld
goals and connected for two out of
three charity tosses for a total of
eight points.

The Fijis entered the game without
their ace, Bill Edmunds, and they
were unable to .

passing Phi Kaps.

with ﬁve points,

route.

Lambda Chi set a new high in scor-
ing in its battle with SAE. Others to
hit 60 points or better this year are
Phi Kappa, and Phi Delta Theta. The
Lambda Chi attack was led by Boras,
Thomas, and Lynch with 20, 19, and
12 points respectively. The game was
as one-sided as the SAE scoring, Don
Ceferratti getting 14 of the 15 points.

Delta Tau Delta still leads the Phi
Eps in ping pong and look like the
eventful winner. The Delts have
three matches left to play including
Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Kappa, and
PiKA.

Theta Chi still leads the bowling
league, but has a few stiff battles
ahead before it retains the ten-pin
championship. Bill Daddio, John
Chickerneo, and Hal Crippen com-
prise the backbone of the Theta Chi
pin-clippers.

Though a mathematical chance for
ithe city championship still remains,
lthe Panther ice sextet will leave for
'§Cleveland today fairly certain that
'Pitt’s only solace will be the divi-
sional playoffs at the end of the
season.

What started out as a bitter drive
to overcome Duquesne last Tuesday,
John Carroll tonight, and Western
Reserve next Tuesday and practical-
ly cement the Mcsorleymen in first
place has turned into a matter of
playing out the string.

Thanks to “sophomore” Dick Scul-
ly and an odd twist of luck, the
Dukes took over the Jungle Cats on
Tuesday 3-2, and increased their
eastern division lead to three points,
in a game spiced with another Panth-
er-Hansberry riot.

In the second session, Scully pick-
ed up a loose puck in center ice, out-
skated Lovett and Schildecker, and
ﬁred into the right corner of the net
at 2:27. Then, at 3:47, Scully tallied
again by shoving in a neat pass from
Vance after Ellis had been feinted
out’ of position.

The Schooley-Friday combination
ﬂashed the light at 9:23 as Bob took
a pass from Friday and lifted the
[puck over Iungerich while the goalie
lay prostrate on the ice.

After making several beautiful
saves early in the third period, Ellis
ﬁnally let Hansberry’s feeble but
tricky shot dribble between his legs
at 6:37. Less than a minute later,
Hansberry and Artz were pounding
away at each other in the middle of
the arena.

After both boys had been tossed in
the penalty box to cool off, Hansber-
ry for three minutes and Irv for one,
the battle broke out again with play-
ers of both teams, Garden attendants,
fans, and police joining in the fun.

Olson Asks Track-Minded
Students to Enter Meeti

Local track fans will get their ﬁrst¢

opportunity to see Coach Carl Olsons
latest collection of track and ﬁeld
stars next Saturday, February 25, at
the Pitt indoor track house when the
varsity and freshman athletes at-
tempt to set up new indoor standards
in the seventh annual University
Championships. All students desir-
ing to participate are asked to ﬁll out
the entry blank and return it to the
athletic office. Olson stresses the fact
that many varsity men got their start
through these meets.

iFreshman competition should also
prove interesting as some of the lead-
ing high school stars of last season
have enrolled at the University and
are anxious to show their ability.
Chief contenders among the ﬁrst year
men are Harold Stickel, William
and Bob Norton in the
sprints, John Brosky, Ben Foote, and
Walter Smith in the mile and the
half-mile, Leonard Powell and Will-
liam Cooper in the hurdles, Francis
Hill in the shot-put, and Bill Kelly
and Red Jessup in the high jump.
Probably the feature attraction of

the meet will be the freshman high-
jumping event in which Bill Kelly,
blind jumper who is being coached
by Pete Bennett, will attempt to win
a ﬁrst place for himself. ‘

Coach Olson will leave tonight for
New York and the N. Y. A. C. Games
with this crack relay team and with
Ken Ryden, hurdling star who has
been out of action due to illness but
who is now ready for action again.
Larry Tregonning will be taken
along in. place of Johnny Wcodruff,
who is still injured.

Frank S uchak
Named Coach

Frank Souchak, BA39, has been
appointed varsity end coach, it was
announced yesterday morning by
Dr. John Bam Sutherland, varsity
football coach.

Souchak succeeds
recently resigned.

A brilliant end on the undefeated
team of a year ago, Souchak re-
ceived All-American ranking. He
also was selected as a member of
the All-East team in the game with
New York Giants and was on the
squad of outstanding American foot-
ball players who toured France this
winter.

Heralded as a great prospect after
his freshman year, Souchak was
hampered by injuries during his
sophomore and junior seasons. In
his final year, he developed up to
All-American expectations.

He was an outstanding golfer
during his undergraduate days, play-
ing number one man of the Pitt
team for three years and also quali-
fymg for the National Open last
year. He is a member of Phi Kappa
and Druids.

‘Politics. 21 Nemess’

After much discussion on the ﬂoor
as to whether or not the various com-
mittee chairmen would be appointed
by the executive committe, a motion
was passed that, “all members of the
individual committee will choose
their own chairman.” ‘

Dr. James C. Charlesworth, asso-3
ciate professor of political science. 

I
I

advised the group that “the state
politics are a mess.”

He explained ‘that, “There should,
be a constitutional convention in:
America. It is impossible for anyi
reforms to be carried through that;
amount to anything in the legislative ,
or administrative ﬁeld until we getﬁ
a new constitution.” i

To fortify this statement, he citedi
three main reasons: 1. “It is high
time we ceased emanating further
be Federal analogy and distribution

f powers. Having separate agen-
ies,._ in government chosen without
_espect to their cooperation has got
to come to an ends.

End Anarchy

 “End “the anarchy in ﬁscal af-
fairs. No state has such an abomin-
a'_l tax and ﬁscal system as Pennsyl-
vania. No state in the United States
offers such a marvelous opportunity
for scientiﬁc taxation.
 3. “We need to revamp local gov-
ernment. Local ofﬁcers should be
chosen on merit. One of the greatest .
needs of the democratic political pro-
cess today is the election of officers
on a short ballot.” ii

In a parting suggestion to the stu-
dents comprising the executive com-
mittee, he advised them that after
their choice of other committees, they
should select one member of the fac-
ulty to meet with the group period-
ically and confer on the technical as-
pects of the proposed work of ICG.

Financial Statements

(See “In the Mail,” Page two)

Release of the financial results of
the Junior From which was held
on January 13, show that the dance
lost $81.37.

According to Emil Narick, BA40,
chairman, and Ray Walters, E40,
who drew up the statement and an
explanatory letter, the loss was
caused by last minute increases in
expenditures and by the bad
weather, which prevented a num-
ber of people who had bought res-
ervation tickets from attending.

The 533 tickets sold on campus
at $3, plus the 552 reservations at
$1, and the slight charge for comps.
produced a total of $2,155.80. Ex-
penditures amounted to $2,237.17.

Major expense item was the
$1,400 paid to Larry Clinton’s or-
chestra. Next largest item of ex-
pense were favors and ballroom

Psychologist Speaks on Plight
ﬁt‘ Suhnormoil Children in School

By Bill Colker

A
Y

“It is possible for a moron to get
to junior high school.”

This was the statement of Dr.
I..awrcnce F. Greenberger, principal
Of Lanﬂley high school at Monday’s
Psychology Forum, on “Meeting the
Needs of Non-Academic Pupils.”

Since last year's law was passed
requiring a student to remain in
high school until the age of 18 in-
stead of 16, he is now pushed on
after failing twice, regardless of
whether or not he has successfully
completed his work.

Under this set-up, the student re-
fuses to work after he has once
failed, on the grounds that he is go-
ing to pass even if he does nothing.
Thus, Q. E. D.

Remarking on individual capabili-
ties of students, Dr. Greenberger told ,
the story of the woman who ap-i

“Another mother speaking on this
said. ‘I know it’s my own daughter,

‘but when you have them like that,

it’s better to have them in a class by
themselves.’ ”

“There are other things this class
of student may do. They may be
proﬁcient at singing or drawing, or
woodwork. It essential that they
learn some activity they like in or
der to keep the respect of their fel-
low students.”

Citing illustrations of morons, Dr.
Greenberger mentioned the boy who,
at 17. didn’t know the number of
months in a year. He was familiar
with June because his birthday fell
‘n that month.

These children, although they are
inferior to the average are capable of

feelings such as a normal person and «

at times they are somewhat repress-
ed. It is the duty of the educator to

To Fine for Future

Violation of Rules

At the weekly meeting of the so-
cial committee of SFA in the Dean
of ‘Women’s office, a new ruling
with reference to social affairs was
passed because of recent violations
of the conm1ittee’s rules.

In the future any organization
assuming ﬁnancial obligations or
scheduling affairs by contract, with-
out first receiving approval of the
social committee of SFA will be
liable to fine. SFA will be empow-
ered to  a minimum ﬁne of not
less than $5.00 nor more than
$150.00, which ﬁne will be imposed
at the disgression of the social com-
mittee.

The severity of the ﬁne will de-
pend on the size of the organiza-
tion and the type of affair being
held.

According to Leo Griffith, C39,
chairman of the SFA social com-
mittee. “thc rule will be rigidly en-
forced.”

Wiley 1 Pulolishesi‘ Dr. Biacitwoodb
Elementary College Physics Text

By Jack Brady

Publication of a physics text “In-
troductory College Physics,” by Dr.
Oswald H. Blackwood, professor of
physics at the University, was re-
cently announced by the John Wiley
and Sons, Inc., publishing company.

According to Dr. Blackwood, the
book gives the non-technical student
an excellent opportunity to become
acquainted with physics and its re-
lation to everyday life.

Readily Understood

Most students have the impression
that physics is not a “snap course.”
Although it is a general belief that
intricate mathematical calculations
must be worked out in a physics
course, Dr. Blackwood’s book can be
readily understood by non-technical
students and be of value to them in
everyday life.

“Physics has guided progress in
the social world. The motion picture
and the radio, products of the physics
laboratory, are binding the world to-
gether in a more closely integrated
organism,” said Dr. Blackwood.

“All that a student need have for
the study of cultural physics is gen-
eral intelligence,” according to Dr.
Blackoowd, “but it is of decided ad-
vantage to have an interest in radio,
automobiles and the relation of sci-
ence to society.”

In his book, Dr. Blackwood says
that “the ﬁrst requirement of a
course in physics is that it should
stimulate the interest of the student
who has had little scientific training.
Illustrative material must be famil-
iar and of vital cc-ncen.”

Compares Favorably

He believes that the best source of
illustration is the automobile, skid-
ding on roads and the streamlined
body to red'..'.ce air friction are well
known to every driver.

Professor A. L. Hughes of Wash-
ington University describes the
book as, “comparing favorably with
,the best of the books on the market.

Speak Latin like everybody else.”

Now the fallacy is at once obvious.
First, students are not required to
“speak” Latin; and second, not all
students are able to complete the
same requirements.

“Looking at it from the opposite
extreme,” stated Dr. Greenberger,

It strikes a judicious balance be-
tween a complete omission of the
“new physics” and too much use of
it. The non-numerical problems are
a welcome feature.”

In a final summing up of the pur-
pose of ‘the book, Dr. Blackwood ex-
plained, “that it is to meet the needs
of the non-technical student.”

The material contained in the
book has been used at the Univer-
sity for the past ﬁve years in a
mimeographed form. Increased
emphasis is placed upon the reason-
ing of the student, rather than on
memory. Important principles be-
come familiar to the student though
repetition of fundamental facts.

elevator boys are feeling down after being up in the air about their defeat
in bowling. The library st:-ickmen pitted their strength against the com-
lcined force of the elevator boys and the Post Office department and came
out decisive victors. The stackmen would like another match in the near
future to justify another victory party. They formally challenge all bowlers.
