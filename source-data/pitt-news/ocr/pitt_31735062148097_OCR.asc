Trustee Group
Calls Special

Board M eeting

‘Group May Consider
Recent Survey Report
Of University Activities
‘Another special" meeting of the
Board of Trustees will be held in
about a week, according to Dr. John
Weber, secretary of the University,
presumably to renew consideration of
the recent report which commented
on the University’s administration.
Several special meetings have been

called in the period since the last
regular meeting in March to deal
with business which did not neces-
sitate a regular meeting.

Dr. Weber in substance denied ru-
mors printed in Pittsburgh newspa-
pers that no regular meeting had
been held in order to avoid seating
Floyd Rose, recently nominated by
the alumni to a vacant position on
the. board. The election of new
members, reserved to the trustees by
their constitution, can take place
only at regular meetings.

Acting under a suggestion made
by former Governor George H. Earle,
several years ago, the Board agreed
to elect to membership those individ-
uals nominated by the alumni to po-
sitions left vacant by members
‘whose terms » have expired. Under
this agreement Norman MacLeod was
elected last spring to succeed himself.

Mr. MacLeod, when contacted by
The News, refused to make any com-
ment on the rumors. The authors
of these rumors were not named by
the city papers but were spoken of
merely as “critics of the Board of
Trustees,” and were said to include
members of the board itself.

Next spring the General Alumni

leaders and Miss Amos will be host-
esses at the tea. 1

wrinkle in literature evaluation—

Coney, now rates its books and man-

eye to preserving its most valuable
material in times of war.

“A” books are to be protected
against air raids “at any cost,” “B”
books, if possible. “C” books con-
stitute the others, Mr. Coney said.

“We’ve been trying to collect only,
“A” books here,” the librarian of the

commented, “but it appears that the
Scots have devised a novel use for
“C" material.

FIIIIM THE

SIDELINES

By BILL McELWAlN
Sports Editor ,

THESE SOPHOMOR-E VVONDERS are always a bad gamble.
'l‘oo many of the boys who are picked for All-American before they
finish their freshman year just don ’t look that way when they get‘ a
«chance to “shine as varsity men.‘ —

Already a number of sophomore ﬂashes have turnedout to be
something less than super-colossal, and the season is only two weeks
old. Take, for example the two games Pitt has played against “Tash-
ington and \Vest Virginia, both of whom were supposed to have some
-brilliant sophomore prospects. . ' ‘

The Huskies spent most ofthe summer talking about their right
tackle, a 230 pound Hawaian named Wayiie Sterling. Sterling, it
was rumored, could break up any kind of interference, could block
with the best, and prarcti/call_v slept with a tackling dummy for a pil-
low. Pitt would be unable toiget past him on the ground, and even
the passers would take, a pounding as -he rushed in to break up
aerials before the play was properly started.’ ‘

Sterling, McCann F izzlc

lame the Panthers and miracle man Sterling became the most
disillusioned football player on the Paciﬁc coast. On the few ground
plays run in his direction, Sterling was outmaneuvered completely,
almost to the point of being ignored. When the Huskies took the
offense, Ste:-ling’s only distinction was his size. His efforts to stop
Pitt’s passing were matched in ineffectiveness only by those of his
ten team mates. '- ' , -

Last Saturday, Vtlest Virginia came to town. _ “Snake” rooters
gurgled l1appil_v.~a,s they masticated hot dogs and waited for sopho-
more Don McCa.nn to run the Panthers behind the ne.aI_'est eight ball.
McCann did not start, but that was expected for the previous week-
end he had been kept out until‘ well along in the game, when he
scored two touchdowns, one on a, 40 yard run, and generally gave
‘Nest Virginia \Vesle_van_ a bad afternoon.

Although the exact ﬁgures are not on hand, McCann’s work
against Pitt deﬁnitely would not put him in the “sensational” class.
In fact, when you compare him with his pre-game press notices, he
looked just about hopeless. VVhether “Sleepy” Glenn was saving
him for big games ahead or whether the competition was too much
for him, we don’t know, but he surely made the experts look over-
entluisiastiia , - 

A third case is Pitt’s Edgar “Special Delivery” Jones, “The
I)Q(.i()I'I'(‘.\’OIli off the East.” In his freshman year, he was “the” star
on one of l’itt’s best yearling elevens. Last spring, he still looked
pretty good. but this fall, an ankle injury slowed him up and he has
yet to show anything that would merit" him even a Second team spot.

Jones Not Up to Expectations

His debut as a varsity man was the least impressive that could be
imagined. Sent in late in the fourth period against the Huskies, he
ran into an official while trying to pass on the first play. \Vhen the
play was completed, Jones had been thrown for a loss of some 38
yards. The game ended a few plays later.‘

.-'\g‘alnst “lest Virginia, he fared little better. Emil Narick re-
fused him as a substitute just before the half ended, and he was
forced to wait until the final period before getting in. Time ran out
before he was given a chance to do anything offensively, although he
did break up a \Vcst Virginia pass on defense. Thus, after two games
the Scranton Scourge is still a long way from stardom.

l)on't give up on any of these boys yet, but remember that
(‘barley l’>o\\'.s(-‘r said, when one of his assistants described a freshman
halfback as “better than Goldberg,” “Yes, they all look like that
until tliey put on a uniforin.”

Boasting two impressive victories in as many tussles, the ‘Duke “Blue

Pitt Harriers F ace
Initial 1939 Test
In Schenley Park

Facing a revenge-stimulated Pur-
due squad, the University of Pitts-
burgh cross—country team lifts the §‘
lid of the 1939 season at Schenley
Park, Saturday morning. ._

The Boilermakers come to the ‘
Smoky City seeking to make amends 
for the 15-40 setback handed them ;'
by the Pitt harriers at Lafayette last 3.
October. According to reports ﬁlter- ‘L
ing from the headquarters of head ,
coach Phillips, he has a more formid- ‘g
able array of harriers than matched :

Holderman,/the _ace of the Purdue 
outﬁt promises .i to provide trouble,-

Sterner will probably be a little more '1
than he can handle at one time. Hold- _
erman’s closest running mate, Reeves, f
does not ﬁgure to oust either Frank '
McCabe or Lew Manuwal from the 
near-runner—up position. ConSe- 
quently, even though Purdue is im- '
proved over last season, the Blue and V
Gold thinclads appear too strong to _.
upset. ‘

Coach Olson has not deﬁnitely de-
cided on the seven men who will be
ﬁrst stringers for Saturday’s contest, 1
time trials being‘ scheduled for to- _
night.

Staff Member of Research Department
Predicts Improvement in Health, Safety

“The health and
working man will steadily improve
in the future,” E. C. Barnes, staff
member of the School of Medicine’s
department of Industrial Hygiene,
says.

Established a year ago as a service
laboratory for physicians and hos-
pitals, the University Industrial
Hygiene department studies individ-
ual cases of industrial diseases in
order to remedy weaknesses in in-
dustrial environments.

“We study the cases of poisonings
from occupational sources and make
no broad surveys,” Mr. Barnes says.
“That job is left to the government.
Our purpose is to increase the inter-
est in industrial hygiene.”

Employers have shown increased
interest in the problem, Barnes says.
Mine operators and industrial lead-
ers are anxious to __decrease the num-
ber of occupational diseases. The
greatest number of illnesses are from

safety of the¢

poisoning resulting in blood and
nervous disorders, blood poisoning
from benzol, and carbon monoxide
poisoning.

The Occupational Disease Com-
pensation law of 1938, recently re-
placed by a new statute, has made
for increased interest in the problem,
Barnes says.

Installs Study Library

For Interest Groups

Off to a ﬂying start on Monday,
the YWCA membership campaign is
now in full swing with the signed-
up members sporting blue and white
ribbons and urging their friends to
join.

The membership committee under
the direction of Betty Brunk, Ed40,
will culminate the drive with a
membership tea on Wednesday, Oc-
tober 18. Although this tea will end
the drive, it will in reality only be-
gin the year’s work of the YWCA,
Miss Brunk says.

Since the YWCA attempts to pro-
vide an interest group for each of its
members, its program includes work
in social service, public affairs, cul-
tural growth, study and worship. To
encourage the study program, the
YWCA has organized a library, avail-
able to all members, under the di-
rection of Marie Pragliola, C41.

This year, for the ﬁrst time, the
YWCA is charging a membership fee
of 50 cents to cover the organiza-
tion’s mailing costs. This fee is pay-
able in 1232 Cathedral at any time.
