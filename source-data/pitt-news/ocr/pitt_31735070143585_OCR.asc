in some of our favorite establishments and a brand new’Nationality Room in the Cathedral.‘

While plenty has changed over summer vacation, the  that make Pitt, well, “Pitt,”
have stayed just the way we remember. South Oakland is still awesome, our football team is
entering another season with its signature “also receiving votes” mantra, and half—off dimer
specials are still the best dealin town. ‘ A A A

a , ‘ Pitt loses

Jared Beiswenger 

Throughout his life, Jared Beiswenger loved
to play and watch sports of every kind. At Great
Valley  School in Malvern, Pa, he ran track
and ﬁeld. J —

When he arrived at the University of Pitts-
burgh, he played intramural basketball and foot-
ball.

Jared was a devoted Eagles, Phillies and Pitt ,

sports fan —- even during the teams’ tottering

advice, and he  particularly adept at 
advice without: you realizing he was doing so,”
Placone said. _

“His character was deﬁned by strength, loy-
alty and passion for life, and I can say without

hesitation that he epitomized the very notion of .

brotherhood.” - V
Additionally, Placone said Jared helped him
to understand when to take  seriously and

years — and he attended countless Pitt basket- when not to worry about the details.

brother Greg Placone I v to waste time 

« Beiswenger,'23, died’ 
suddenly on _ May 18, "1";
2008. He left behind
his parents, Robert and
Janet, and sisters, Rachel
and Roxanne
A Pitt graduate in April 2006, Jared’s‘ love
for sports was apparent to everyone who knew
him .

“He was a die-hard Philly fan,” said Placone.

“He went to probably more than 20 Phillies
games this season alone, and he wouldn’t miss
the Eages on Sunday for anything” '
Placone also remembered how hard Jared
took each loss that his favorite teams faced
“It was impossible to even talk to him after a
game was over,” hesaid. “I-Ie’d be too angry to

, even acknowledge your question.” .

Luke Fidler, another one of Jared’s fraternity
brothers, remembered Jared’s competitive, spirit
and hatred for losing. _

“I’ll. always remember  to Pitt basket-
ball games with him,” said Fidler.

. “He was the craziest fan I’ve ever been 
at a game, and the Zoo deﬁnitely lost one of its
biggest fans,” he said. .

‘Jared always got his choice of seats‘ at Pitt
basketball games by  at the gate several

hoursbefore ripoff, Placone added.

i “He liked to wear an Adidas headband, hark-
ing back to the Page da ” he said.

“He read the PittBlathe1;com daily, and we’d
always chat about the latest Pitt news posted on
there” .

Besides sports, Jared was a member of Delta
Phi fraternity and served as the ﬁaternitfs vice
president and pledge master throughout his col-
lege years 8 .

While  these leadership positions,

Placone recalled how Jared bettered and chal- _

lenged others and led with an unwavering ex-
ample. . ’ *
“He had the unique ability to give insightful

 

 the same mistakes, and
 his life_was very much
 deﬁned by 
every moment to make
the best out of daunt-
ing challenges” J - I A
In addition to sports and his fraternity, an-
other one of Jared’s interests included watching
the television show “Lost,” said Placone Jared
discussed the show’s complex mythology with
Placone through back and forth he-mails during
their free time at work
-- “He loved to rehash theories about the show
and its direction with any other ‘Lost’ fanatic,”

‘ he said.

Placone said that Jared, who majored in
communication and Spanish, planned to teach
English in Peru through the TEFL program
  2009. '

He already started the process with the certi-
ﬁcation program and spent lots of time research-
-ing where he wanted to teach in Latin America
and what program would be best to’ ‘do’ _so. _

He also recently applied for his passport and

was slated to leave for Peru in August

Although he never obtained the opportunity
to teach in Latin America, Jared’s friends will

' always remember the determination and drive

that led him m that direction.

-‘As far as his strengths go, he never gave up
on anything,” said Fidler. “He wasone of the
most determined people I’ve ever known. He
had an awesome sense of humor and could
make almost anyone laugh.”

Steve Grisanti, one of Jared’s fraternity
brothers who was in the same pledge class as
him, said thatJared was one of his only friends
that he could fully uust - ‘ -

“He never wanted anything in return,” he
said. “He was always  to sacriﬁce himself
for the betterment of his ﬁiends. I think of him
as one of my best friends, but so does everyone
else who was ‘close to him.” ‘

Possible’ Port Authoritystrike threatens county.

b_y_Jessel August Costa III .
Staﬂ W/riter

The Port Authority of Allegheny
County — the organization in charge
of the county’s bus, trolley and‘ incline
services, as well as the T —— and the
Amalgamated Transit Union’s Local
85 recently hit a pothole on the road to
a new labor agreement.

A strike at any time by Port Author-
ity’ employees would leave countiess

riders (about 230,000 trips perdayas_
. reported bythe PA’I) around Allegh-

enyCountystt'anded. - e
The-contract for Port Authority
employees ended on June 30, said the
Port Authorityfs “Pitisburgh Transit
Info” Web site, whidr was established
to inform the public of labor agree-
ment developments.
' Increasing gas  is one of
the issues  the  Authority
squirm and consider  back on

ﬁinds currently allocated to employees, 0

causing ﬁiction between the Port Au-.
thority and ATU Local 85.

The Port Authorityfs 2009 budget
undertakes“a  of $10 million
in cost reductions  will be 
through the collective  pro-
cess with ATULocal85,” accordingtao
a Port Authority press release

Much of this reduction would
come  from health care pen-
sions and post-retirement beneﬁts V

The Authorityfs Web site 
that under the current plan, employ-
ees’ average earnings per year are

$48,653.74,.and this would notchange .

as aresultof the proposed plan. Health
and wellness beneﬁts, however, would
undergo changes

Currentiy, Port Authority em-
ployees pay $501.92 annually for their
health coverage, while the Port Author-
ity picks up the slack— $14,533.96 per
employs: peryear:

Under Port Authoritys proposal,
employees would increase their invar-
ment in health benefits to $1,46327
with the Authority  the re-
maining$13,572.61. H ‘

Iikewise, employees currentlypay
$5,911.43  pension, Social Secu-

‘rityandotherretrm entsav1ngs,' while

Port Authority pays $6,796.93.

Under the new plan, employees
would pay $6,64123 and Port Author-
ity would pay $6,067.12.

The total cost reduction for Port

Authority under the new _plan would

be $1,691.16 per employee (from
$69,984.63 to $68,293.47 per employ-
es per year) 1 .

. Patrick McMahon, president-
business agent for Local 85, views the
expectation for such cuts as “absolutely
not fair.” . 1 _ «

‘Tm  to tell you something
right now, it’s not  to happen,” he
said. -

McMahon said that it is not reason-
able to expectworkers, manylof whom
5‘take the job for the beneﬁts [pension
and post-retirement package]” to be
cut off afteryearsof service

piece of the puzzle left and that can

he said ’

The Port Authority cited iri a press L

its budget for next: year is $350.3 mil- ’

the past ﬁscal year. . - ‘
“Every penny increase in the cost
of diesel fuel adds $80,000 in expense

This cost is in addition to a pen-
sion of 25 percent times the number

cording t0 the Pittsburgh Transit Info

Port Authority board memberjoan
Ellenbogen said that the 
costs are becoming a burden.

“Taxpayers and transit riders can-

Despite a required summer ac-

tivities fee for all summer students at

Pitt, just three student groups received
money from Student Government
Board’s summer activities fund

Only one of those activities oc-
curred this summer The other two are
scheduled to take place this fall.

Students  12 or more credits
during summer sessions paid $14 for
the undergraduate activities fee, and
students taking fewer than 12 credits
paid $7, said Terrence  a Stu-
dent Life aclrIliI]iSt1‘atOr. t

Former allocations committee

member Rhajiv Ratnatunga said that --

a summer activities fee is a necessary
expense _ '

“It’s one of those standard fees
you just have to payﬁ ’ said Ratnatiunga.
“It’s a pretty small fee ..; You’re a Pit:
student, ybu’re going to have to pay
it”. -

The committee approved three re-

‘queststhis summer: Hillel’s request for

$180 to attend the AZRA National
Assembly, the Mock Trial team’s re-
quest for $1,563 to attend the UVA In-
vitational Tournament in the fall; and
Panthers for Israels request for $1,115
to host the Maital Guttrnan program
in the fall. ‘

The allocations committee

also denied ‘four requests
The Catholic Anchor, a publica-
tion that releases a religious magazine

each semester, was denied a request ~

for $1,446 to publish a summer issue

/because the committeesaid most stu-
dents would not be on Pitt’s campus
to read it;

“We don’t really fund prograrn-
ming that doesn’t occur when the ma-
jority of students are on campus,” said
Handler c. ‘

‘ , Joanna Klapacz, editor in chief o

The Catholic Anchor; said “she was a

- disappointed about the committee’s

I denial. She said The Catholic Anchor ,
_ nonnallypubﬁshes a summer issue-

tomailtoincomingfreshmanandto
hand out at the student  
which occurs before the start of fall
classes '
Klapacz said her’ group  still

publish about 1,500 copies of its sum-

mer issue by  leftover funds, but
that there will not be many additional
copies to distiibute at the activities fair
and other areas on campus

' A  also questions the way the

undergraduate activities fees gathered A

during the summer are used.
‘fA complaint I have heard from
other students is that there aren’t

_ enough   onin the sum-
met, so sometimes you just have to"

wonder where the money is. going,”

The SGB allocations committee

Narissa Handler, vice chairperson"

of SGB’s allocations committee, said

that the committee puts the money ’

During the summer the allocations

‘committee voted on all of its requests

Handler said most groups spend
the summer planning for the fall se-
mester rather than hosting activities

“Iheyfre not going to have a pro-
gram in thesummer when students
aren’t around,” said Handler V

Handler said she does not see. a

problem with the fact that students still,

Three other student groups were
denied requests this summer.

The women’s Ultimate Frisbee
team’s request for $51,360 for the Col-
lege Sectionals and College. Contex
Tournaments was denied because it
was a request for deﬁcit 
meaning the tournaments had already
occurred .

Phi Sigma Rho, a social sorority
for women in the ﬁeld"of engineer-
ing, was denied a $1,060 request for a
leadership conference because it, too,
was for deficit spending. Handler

requests for deﬁcit spending are never

_ Kappa Kappa Psi, a coed frater-
nityy for students in the Pitt band, was
denied a request for $600 for new
ritual robes Handler, said that ritual
robes should be paid -for  other
sources, such as membership dues or
private accounts. ,
During the past academic year, the
student activities fee was 3580 per se-
mester for full-time students and $24 a

, semester for part-time students

Onorato:

i ‘by Holden  Slattery
Staff Wrtier

Since 1929, the city of Pitts-

burgh and Allegheny County gov- .
. ernments have considered merging, .

but‘ this summer, the discussion
about a city-county consolidation
heated up;

The goal of this consolidation ’

would be to . make‘ government

more effective and efficient in the "

Pittsburgh region and heal-some

of its economic woes.

The concept is to abolish the
Office of the Mayor, Pittsburgh
City Council, Office of the Coun-

ty Executive and the Allegheny.

County Council and then to create
a new governmental structure with
a new mayor and council of met-
ropolitan Pittsburgh, said Kevin
Evanto, a spokesman for Allegh-
eny County Chief Executive Dan
Onorato. - i

The plan would also eliminate.
. the duplication of services that

currently exists in the region. Right

now, Allegheny County and the .
_ city of Pittsburgheach have sepa— "
' rate departments for public works,

parks and recreation, telecommu- -

nications and many other. services.
.“We duplicate almost every-

thing,” said Evanto.

Pitt’s chancellor Mark Norden-
berg has played a major role in the

consolidation ‘discussion. Onorato .

and Pittsburglfs mayor. Luke Ra-
venstahl designed a cbmmittee in
2006 to analyze the idea and chose
Nordenberg as chair of the com-
mittee. a n i
As chair of the Citizens Advi-

t sory Committee.on the ‘Efficiency

and Effectiveness, of City-County
Government, ' Nordenberg has
played a signiﬁcant role in commu-

nicating to local officials that city— '

county consolidation is necessary
[On April 3, the committee re-
leased. a detailedreport that dis-
cussed reasons to consolidate and
listed other cities that consolidated
to fix problems similar to those

' Pittsburgh faces.

Then, on May 28, the House

Urban Affairs Cornrnittee, another .
committee jdesignedt to analyze
the implications and feasibility of ‘
lmerging the two governments,

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.coIn

held .a public hearing on the pro:
- posed’'Allegheny CountyConsoli—

dation at Point Park University’s

' Lawrence Hall. —

Onorato and  ad—i ;

\ dressed the committee by; reading

statements expressing  strong
support of the proposed merger.

_Onorato emphasized that the V

duplication of services makes for
less efﬁcient county and city gov-
ernments. iHe said that there is no
reason for the city and countyto.
have separate departments of pub-
lic works and parks and recreation.

, Pittsburgh’s. ' consolidation

. would most likely be modeled af-

ter the consolidation  Louisville,
Ky., which merged with Jefferson
County in 2000,'said Onorato. '
A merger is necessary to- ac-
commodate the current demo-

graphicsin the region, which have -

changed as people have continu-
ously moved from the city of Pitts-
burgh to other municipalities in.Al-
-legheny County, he said. ' ~

‘ , “Today, 75 percent of Allegh-
eny _County,_lives_ outside ' of Pitts-

both the other vendors and the stu-
dents who shop there. ,

, Martin Lynn, a student at the
Community College of Allegh-

Pitt" students lobby. for gender-neutral housing options

by“Jessel August Costa III
Staﬁ’ Writer

Counselors at summer camps
have asaying: ‘The girls’ rooms are
pink, the boys’ rooms are blue, and
no one should be making purple.”

Intermingling of the sexes might
have been taboo back in the camp
days of childhood, but in college,
many students might ﬁnd “purple”
housing more -practical.

Pitt’s Rainbow Alliance, with help
from members of the administra-
tion and faculty, has recently been
part of a growing movement seek-
ing gender—neutral accommodations
for collegians,

Gender—neutral housing consti-
tutes “providing the option for two
students to live together  without
restriction based on sex or gender”

and ‘restrooms “that may be used,

by a person of any gender or sex,”
according to the Gender Public Ad-

H vocacy Coalition’s Gender Equality

National Index for Universities and
Schools, or GENIUS index —— a
resource that “tracks andevaluates
the efforts of schools to ‘prohibit
discrimination.”

‘According to the index, “One-
third of college students ‘report be-
ing harassed or discnminated against
on campus for not ﬁtting expecta-
tions of masculinity or femininity.”

The Coalition recognizes that
student members of ethnic, racial
and sexual minorities face a number
of obstacles and says, “Protections

if for students who don’t fit expecta-

tions for, masculinity or femininity

. are especially important.”

Rainbow Alliance ‘President Aar-
on Arnold said, “Gender , is some-
thingunique to aperson  in that
sense, it can create a lot of . scary situ-
ations for people that do not wish to
express their gender in the traditional
binary” ’ C I ‘

Fear of,‘ uncomfortable situa-

tions, coupled with compassion for
those involvedinthern, has led many
of the top colleges and universities
across the country to reevaluate their
policies regarding student housing. A
Of the riation’s top 25- universi-
ties, 17 have nondiscrimination
policies that are inclusive of “gen-
der identity and expression,” as well
as “sexual orientation” (of the two
Pennsylvania’ schools on the list,

Carnegie Mellon University and the,
University of Pennsylvania, only

Penn had such a policy)_.

Seventeen of the 25 offered
gender-neutral restrooms _ 
and Penn included), and six schools
offered students a gender-neutral

housing option _——the ability to live
1 in the same 'c_lorrnitory room with’ a

member of the opposite sex. Again,

both CMU and Penn were among
those schools according to the in-’i

' dex.

Also according to theiindex, Pitt
has not implemented any of those

policies, while other schoolstwithin

the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
—- including Moravian, Muhlenberg,
Peirce and Swarthmore colleges, as

well as Bucknell, Lehigh  Penn

State universities —- have done so.
Arnold said, “Most schools [that
have implemented such policies]

f nold.  .

tend to be smaller, more liberal arts

schools with a progressive faculty.”
He added, however, that he is I

“not sure what will ﬂy in this re-

theless, pleading the “case to the Uni-

issue to the attention of Student Af— '

Pitt is the campus on the hillside,
an urban school hugging a ridge of
the Allegheny Mountains To most
students, this topographical _reality

' means a short—of—breath trek from

Fifth Avenue to Upper Campus or
hopping a University shuttle. But

' for students with physical disabilities,

this campus is a mountain to climb,
posing many ﬁtustrations for wheel-
chair—bound students. I

‘.‘There’s maybe three undergrad-
uates on campus who: use wheel-
chairs that we know of,” said Lynnet
Van Slyke, director of Pitt’s Disability
Resources and Services. The office
works to accommodate students
with physical, psychological or learn-
ing disabilities who request their as-
sistance. ‘ ~

“About 10 percent [of students I

ity issues, and the Pitt campus poses

a whole new set of challenges, she

plagues Pittsburgh. H

pus from her North Side apartment.

- She said she was lucky to procure a
' parking space for her family’s van:
in - Forbes Tower’s garage, where_

the ﬂoors above the_ parking spaces
house her graduate school. A

' “Otherwise, there’s no other way
I could park because of the wheel-

she said, rattling off her list of acces-

» ‘ Josie Badger, one of the few stu-

dents at Pitt who uses a wheelchair,
knows ﬁrsthand how tough it is -to
tackle Oakland with a wheelchair.

Badger, 24, is a rehabilitation
counseling student in the School of
Health and Rehabilitation _Sciences
and president of the National Youth
Leadership Network, a leadership
organization for young people 
with disabilities. She has myasthenia
gravis, a rare form of muscular dys-
trophy that causes loss of control of
all voluntary muscles. It conﬁnes her
to a motorizedlwheelchair

After growing up near Beaver

Falls, Pa., on her family’s, farm and —

graduating Valedictorian of her  '

“It takes more than twice the en-

Students in manual ‘wheelchairs face
the issue of exhaustion regularl , be-
coming so fatigued they struggle to
stay awake for class, she said. _

’ Because Badger stays mostly in-
side Forbes Tower, she doesn’t have
to worry about traversing campus
to get. to class, relying on shuttles to
reach a dorm or apartment or navi-

gating Oakland’s sidewalks.

But older, uneven pavement slabs
pose problems ‘for wheelchair users
_ hitting a bump in the sidewalk can
cause a person to fall out of a wheel-
chair. A few years ago the city put

. curb cuts in sideyvalks to make them

level with the streets, but the problem
is the sidewalks themselves, said Van
Slyke

The Americans with Disabilities

— Act, which Congress passed in 1990,

mandates that public  are
accessible to people with disabilities.
Public  now must include
ramps, parking spaces and curb cuts
in the sidewalks because of the law.

limited in mobility suffer it lack of

Pitt. _ - -;

Currently, Pitt offers no gradu-

for people with physical disabilities.
There are 19 University residence
buildings on and off campus, includ-

But Badger wasn’t eligible for this

in the summer, especially the trees
around the Cathedral, because they
make for premium study spots. How-
ever, she acknowledges that Pitt’s ur-
ban setting makes it difficult to com~
pare with other colleges _ A

“I think we stack up pretty damn
good,” said Trent “\We can’t do the
stuff they  State] do because
we’re in the middle of the city. Pitt is
like its own city” I

Teachers taking the time  

to teach teachers to teach

in other professional development’

‘by Elharn Khatami
Contributing Editor

Their students might have been
out of school for the summer, but
for 15 local teachers, there was still
a lot to learn.’

As participants in Pitt’s West-
ern Pennsylvania  Project
invitational summer institute, a re-
gional branch of the National Writ-
ing Project, the teachers focused on
learning how to improve their stu-
dents’ wtiting abilities. ,

Every summer, the WPWP re-
cruits a class of teachers from the
Western Pennsylvania area to take
part in the program. From July 7 to
Aug. 1, teachers of all grade levels
studied and practiced Various‘ writ-
ing styles, including poetiy opin-
ions and professional writing, 

the hope that by improving their
own skills, they "can improve their‘

students’ writing.
“We subscribe to two prin—
ciples,’’ said Don Bialostosky, the

  

_co—director-of the summer institute P

and a professor of English at Pitt.
“Teachers who write are the best
teachers, of writing, and the best
teachers of teachers are teachers.”

M The teachers learned about

writing across. the curriculum, peer
editing. and writing with a voice.
Guest visits from writers like poet
Lois Williams and Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette columnist Tony Norman

-- allowed participants to learn from
professionalwriters firsthand: - ~

“It was an intense five weeks,”
said Tamara Goldbogen, a partici-
pant in the summer institute and a
professor in Pitt’s theater depart-
ment.

“I’ had the chance to meet and
develop airelationshipiwith all these
classroom teachers across Western
Pennsylvania and got an under-
standing of the challenges they’re
facing.” . '

Upon completion of the sum-
mer invitational, WPWP fellows
have the opportunity to take‘ part

projects. ‘One such project is a
.week—long program called “Teach-
ing Writing  the Era of No Child
Left» Behind,” designed to ‘help in-
structors with teaching in an atmoé
sphere of highestakes testing. V ‘
“Once you go through it [the
summer institute], you then be-
come part of this family,” said
Goldbogen. “They have events,

‘retreats and opportunities to con— .
vwtinueito share wor ”~ J ‘ ’

During the second and last; day
of the invitational,_the participants
-took part in a “writing marathon”
in which they walked throughout
Oakland to write and share their
w‘ork,with_ one another.  so doing,
teachers were able to learn from
one another and better develop
their individual abilities.

“All you say after a reading is
thanks, there’s no critique,” said

_‘ Bialostosky. “It’s astonishing what

as powerful community-building
program that is.” '

been given the once—in—a—lifetime

_opportunity to reconnectwith

their religious roots in Israel.

Tagli't—Bi'rthright Israel is a
“historical - partnership,” the
group’s Web site says, “between
the people of Israel through their
government, local Jewish com-
munities and leading Jewish
“philanthropists” that provides
college students and adults be-
tween the ages of 18 and 26 the
gift of_ a trip to Israel._

The group’s Web site estab-
lishes that the program was cre-
ated “to send tens of thousands
of young Jewish adults from all
over the world to Israel as a gift
in order to diminish growing di_—
vision between Israel and Jewish‘
communities around the world.”

The gift itself covers “round-
trip airfare, hotel, transporthtion,
most meals and most other asso-I

~ ciated land costs for the approved

ll)‘-day trips to Israel,” the Web
site says. I
Pitt student Adam Perl, who

went on the trip, in ‘May,_relayed I

the experience of a young man
on a trip a world away, finally at-
home.

Perl first explained that the
trip is incredibly structured.

“Our schedule was planned to
the minute — when and where

we were supposed to be. The
only time we had for autonomous P

activity was during lunch or a few
shopping expeditions. , »
“We would wake upat 7 [a.m.]
for breakfast at 7:30,” he said,
“[and] depending on the place

[we] were staying, it could make,

or break [our] day.”

i From there, he said, “[There
was] maybe an hour bus ride to
[our] first destination, with tour
guide commentary along the
way.” Incidentally, = Perl said this
time was also where much of the
previous night’s missed sleep was
made up. —\- _

Most of the day’s physical ac-
tivity took place in the morning
hours to avoid the midday heat,

said Perl.

Lunch was one of the few
times that Perl’s group had time
to explore solo" in a downtown"
area or plaza. As far as dining was
concerned, A -“falafel or schwarma
were the big hits with us,” he

said.

66

I already knew I was aJew, i
but during my trip, I learned I
° what aJew was.

More traveling followed, as
well as more group activities —

“maybe a group togetherness ac- .

tivity like a talk, and some more
programming,” said Perl. .
Then it was back to the hotel
I for dinner.

There were some night pro— .

grams in. the city or- in a group
setting at the hotel, but those

ended early enough to allow for
socializing and bar hopping.
Still, Perl said, “I didn’t come
to Israel to get drunk.” he
The continual guidance and
supervision was a necessary hin-
drance to.Perl’s group, as the cur-
rent turmoil in the Middle East
created safety‘ concerns for for-
eigners abroad. I
i“I felt" safe, although every-
where [we] went, [we] saw an
IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) so1—_
diet with an assault riﬂe or a tour
guard with a’ rifle from World
War II,” said Perl. .“It was good
to knowithat the good people in
the country were armed.” '

On a day—by—day basis, howev—ii.

er, securitywas not as stringent.
In fact, most of the time spent
on security measures took place
in the airports. .
“We had to go through lots of

airport checkpoints to get inand
out, but once inside, there were"

only, two roadside checkpoints
(through the Golan Heights and

the West Bank) and only one bag

checkpoint in a crowded market
district,” said Perl. _ ‘

But what about the parts of

. the trip that .can’t be captured on

a trip itinerary? ,

Perl admits that he was 'never
really religious,-yet his experience,
in his own words, helped him to
experience cultural pride first-
hand. .

‘ “I never had [the feeling of]
Jewish pride that I was taught to
have in Hebrew school,” he said.
.“I already knew I was a Jew, but

during my trip, I learned what a’

Jew was.”

Insofar asthe effect that this
trip might have on his faith, Perl
said the trip has actually made
him less religious —— in the tradi-
tional sense. -

“Going to Israel and seeing
that 90 percent of the Jews there
were secular ——.in the ‘most holy
land’ —— made me feel Very com‘-
fortable,” he said. ‘ ’

“Being raised in an Orthodox
synagogue and a conservative
household, I always had a feel-
ing_ of alienation ‘within my own
people. In Israel, [I was in] as for-

eign land that gave me a feeling

of belonging.” -

Multicultural floor to be introduced

Dorms, page 18

currently at a standstill awaiting a de-
cision from the University’s board.

“Everything we can do is ex-
hausted until the Board of Trustees
adds ‘gender identiﬁcation and ex-
pression’ to its non-discrimination
policies,” said Arnold.

This is a difﬁcult task, consider-

.  the amount of work that must

go into the'process.

“There is a lot to be done,”
said Arnold. “[From a logistics
standpoint], handbooks need to be
changed, people need to be trained,
et cetera.” i

He added that the makeup of the
Board of Trustees, with members
ranging from University ofﬁcials and
prominent alumni, to members of
the community and local political
ﬁgures, adds yet another dimension
to the already multi-faceted issue

The first sign of progress will be
the introduction of a multicultural
ﬂoor instituted by ResLife whose
population will span across gender,
race, sexual orientation and other
distinctions, said Arnold.

Some opponents of gender-

TIIE DEPAR'rMEN’I' OF COMMUNGICMION

 

neutral housing contend that such
measures would open a loophole
through which romantic couples
would cohabitate in University build-
ings, break up — as young college
couples are prone to do — and thus
leave one of the students forced to
transfer rooms rnid—year/ semester
or suffer an uncomfortable 
situation.

Likewise, Counseling Center Di-
rector James Cox points out the fact
that if students “really want to live in
a coed situation, they can get a house
[after their freshman year] .”

Further, Cox said that the Uni-
versity only houses 7,000 students,
indicating the large percentage of
students who commute or live in
off—carnpus housing and thus al-
ready have the apartment autonomy
that they’re after.

_]ef&ey Chang, co—founder and

"associate director of the National

Student Genderblind Campaign,
agrees with the data but not with the
assertion

ultimately decide to live with a mem-

ber of a different gender in the same
room is quite small — only about 2
percent of the entire student body,”
said Chang. 4

“[However] allowing gender-

neutral rooming provides options

for all students and gives them the
freedom to choose who they feel
most comfortable with.”

Insofar as potential problems are i

concerned, Mr. Chang said, “Col-
lege students know the dangers with
rooming with their signiﬁcant other,
whether the couple is gay or straight
Under most status—quo, single—sex
rooming options, gay couples are
able to live together without any
questions  College students are
adults and, more often than not,
make the right decisions for [them-
selves].”

Student reaction to the issue was
mixed.

Pitt senior Will Vrth admits that
if  the choice, he would much
prefer to have a bit of diversity in his
dorm life.

“My close—knit group of friends
consists of both boys and   It

0 would make me more comfortable

to know that no matter who I am

friends with, I have the option of liv— ‘ ‘

ing with them,” he said. '
Likewise, graduating senior from
Pittsburgh Central Catholic High

.. School Michael Cratsley said, “[If

given the option] I would like to
live with some girls that I am good

ﬁiends with now, but if I was going_

to live with a stranger, I don’t think I

' would choose a girl  I’d be more

comfortable ﬁn that situation] 
with a guy.”

Finally, Zoe Hayden, a graduat-
ing senior at Iaurel Highlands 
School, imparted a bit of advice to
those who are, as are she and Crats-
ley, about to move off to college for
the first time.

“You should probably practice-

with people that you [were assigned
to live with] to test your limits and
learn how to live with others,” said
Hayden. “You wouldn’t want to lose
your best friend or [signiﬁcant other]
just because you’re inexperienced
and uncomfortable  on your

own.”

“[_The initiative] is in the process of

To those who retall a time when the
Penn Avenue corridor served as a gate-
waybetweenDowntownPit1sburghand
East  the goal is a feasible one

Decades ago, the areas were two

In the twodecade span between

disappearance of more than 50 small

of the city.

"Ihe PAAI was created to trans-
form the Penn Avenue corridor liom a.
strugglrng' business district into a 
thriving multicultural business district
with artists, arts organizations, arts-re-
lated businesses, ethnic restaurants and
neighborhoodserving businesses.

Collins seconded this sentiment.

“The location of the avenue allows
us to combine the interests of the sur-
rounding neighborhoods and their con-
stituents We look at Penn Avenue as a
zipper; connecting the"ndghborhoods”
she said.

Much of this area still boasts the
original architectural beauty of its heyday,
but years of maltreatment and neglect
havemadeitaforrnidablechallengefor
community activists and developersjto
take on. I

The Arts Initiative draws from the
strengths of  anchor businesses
in the district,  the Pittsburgh
Glass Center, Dance Alloy and Garﬁeld
Artworks, as well as the many small art
studios and galleries that have found a
home on Penn Avenue. A

The PAAI does not, however, envi-

ists create their work, but instead where
artists, residents of the  of Pittsburgh
and the region as a whole can come
together and  in a common
arena of creative energy.

To facilitate such interaction, the
PAAI offers avarietyof festivalsandac—
 throughout the year Among the

A most popular of these activities is Un-

blunred, a monthly event that highlights
local  artisans, art studios, galler-
ies, organizations and the Penn Avenue

_ Inits ﬁrstdecadeof servicetrothe
city of Pittsburgh, the PAAI has already
accomplished much. More than 30 art-
ists, arts businesses and arts organiza-
tions now call Penn Avenue home. Ten

around campus easier for people with
limited mobility. They developed and
published a map of campus detailing
wheelchair accessible entrances to
buildings The map is on Disabilitiy
Resources’ Web site.

In case of emergency

But no matter how helpful, no
map alone can provide safe, efﬁcient
evacuation from buildings during
emergencies

The Department of ’Environ-
ment Health and Safety addresses the
needs of people with disabilities in
preparing for those times. It encour-
ages students, faculty and staff to
come to it to develop a customized
action plan for emergency evacua-
tions.

wheelchairs so that others can get
around them, call the campus emer-
gency number, extension 42121, and
wait for assistance from the fire de-
partment.

Fitzgerald and her colleague in
the School of Health and Rehabili-
tation Sciences, Professor Katherine
Seelrnan, brought the issue of emer-
gency evacuation plans to the Uni-
versity Senate meeting last spring to
address the possibility that discrirni—
nation against people with disabilities
might occur

“If you don’t educate and com-
municate to address the problems,
we may have a terrible tragedy on our
hands,” said Seelman at the meeting.

_ Inside Forbes Tower, ﬁre—safe
wait areas, or “areas of rescue assis-
tance,” are designated on each floor.
Theoretically, if the building was
evacuated, a person in a wheelchair
would wait in one of the areas Uni-
versity staff would come to help take
the person out of the 

But not all buildings are as well-
equipped. The Cathedral of Learn-

ing, for example, stands 41 stories
high and relies on the service of 10
elevators ‘

“If there’s a ﬁre or explosion in
this building, getting everyone down
the steps is a disaster  to hap-
pen,” Fitzgerald said, referring to the
Cathedral

Rob Flannery, a graduate student
in the School of Health and Reha-
bilitation Sciences who has muscular
dystrophy and has used a wheelchair

he said, aren’t all completely acces-

seldom leaves Forbes Tower.

Flannery, 28, has not sought out
the Department of Environmental

He has used the Disability Re-

with accessibility in the past.

“Overall, people have been ac-
commodating and  to listen,”

Officer shoots man wielding cleaver

by Katelyn Polantz
Editor in C/zicf

A tense confrontation between
a landlord and a tenant wielding
a meat cleaver ended with a fatal
shooting on May 23.

A police officer shot the tenant,
Nang T. Nguyen, in the ‘chest just af-
ter 3 p.m. at the corner of Bates and
Atwood streets. Police then closed
the intersection for most of the af-
ternoon.

Nguyen, known as “Ricky” to
his friends, had a history of mental
instability, his long—time landlord,
Chong Won Kim, said. '

Kim, who owns the apartment
Nguyenarented above Kim’s Orien-
tal Grocery at 366 Atwood St, told
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that
he was working in his store when
Nguyen came down from his third-
ﬂoor apartment holding the meat
cleaver and mumbling with a vacant
look in his eyes.

Nguyen’s behavior alarmed Kim
andiprompted him to run outside

'13/gs21§,tLi5¢rty,ﬂr2cnue , -’Pr'tts6ur¢

as an ﬁe weli urwtrtcliurcﬁilirtuzcom

and call the police.

When an officer arrived, Nguyen
was holding the knife outside Mad
Mex restaurant and bar.

Dennis Raspunti, Sr. who
watched the scene unfold from his
porch at 347 Atwood St, said that
the officer repeatedly asked Nguyen
to drop the knife.

When he refused, the officer
shot him once in the chest

For hours after, Nguyen lay
handcuffed and dead on the side-
walk footsteps away from the entry
to Mad Mex. Bystanders watched
from the street and from porches
surrounding the intersection.

City police from Zone 4, the
unit from which the responding of-
ficer hailed, could not be reached to
comment on. the ofﬁcer’s actions
But Ron Bennett, the community
relations officer for Pitt police, said
that he felt the officer followed pro-
tocol.

“We don’t aim at elbows and
arms and all that,” said Bennett of
standard police protocol.

. “We purposely don’t. If we feel
our lives are in danger, we shoot at
the best target Stopping the person
means shooting at the center mass,
and that is what the officer did.”

Still, some feel that killing Nguy-
en was extreme.

Emil Lester, formerly the owner
of City Cafe on Market Square
Downtown, said he came to know
Nguyen through another frequent
customer who often cared for Nguy-
en and received some of Nguyen’s
Vietnamese cooking in return.

“I had a cafe Downtown, and my
place was the kind of place where
people went to talk,” said Lester.

It was in  with his frequent
customer, whom he called “Charles,”
that Lester learned of Nguyen and

if became familiar with his poor men-

tal health and financial problems.
Considering all of Nguyen’s ob-
stacles, Lester believes that the po-
liceman didn’t need to shoot to kill.
“Ricky was 100 pounds. The
policeman could’ve puffed and he
would’ve fallen over,” he said.

Many bars exempt

from _ smoking ban

by Holden Slattery
Staff Writer

When Oakland’s Mad Mex res—.

taurant and bar became exclusively
non—srrioking in March, it did so
for moral reasons. Now, some oth-
er Oakland establishments must
follow suit, a new state law says.
The Clean Indoor Air Act,
signed by Gov. Ed Rendell on
June 13, will ban smoking in most
public buildings and workplaces
throughout the state but will not
have a sweeping effect on Oakland

businesses because of an exemp-

tion. ,
Bars or taverns that make less
than 20 percent of their total sales
from food are immune from the
ban. ‘

Oakland venues, including

Boomerang’s, Garage Door Sa-
loon and Bootleggers, all of which
make little to no food sales, will

run as usual, while restaurant/ bars
like Peter’s Pub, Fuel & Fuddle,]oe
Mama’s and Primanti Brothers will
have to be smoke-free under the
law, which takes effect on Sept. 11
—- 90 days after Rendell’s signing.

“Unfortunately, we’re upset
there are exemptions,” said Tom
Baron, owner of big Burrito Res-
taurant Group, which includes
Mad Mex.

“I think what it says is that they
care about the health of some em-
ployees but not all employees,” he
said.

Baron made the switch to non-
smoking on March 1, when one
of his employees became preg-
nant. Baron said he was sick of
waiting for the state or county to
pass a smoking. ban and decided
to make all of his restaurants non-
smoking.

“It was the right  to do,”

During his time in college, john.

hand the beneﬁts that came from

Now, Pitt’s  Association
wants others to meet those people,
too.

To facilitate networking among
past Panthers, the association orga-
nized National Pitt Networking Day,

Voinski, who now. works as -a

' tax attorney in New York and is the
president of the New York Pitt Club
-4 the association’s New York chap-
ter ——+ said that networking is a tactic
that all students and alumni should
utilize

“More than likely, when I recom-

someone I know instead of using

said Voinski of the beneﬁts of net-

Fuel and F uddle steams ahead aft all pven fire

by Hayley Grgurich
Adaidta/zt New Editor

A rogue ember mused the ﬁiel be-
neath Fuel & Fuddle restaurant and
bars pizza oven to catch ﬁre Tuesday,
June 10. Thanks to the construction of
the oven and its ﬂame—retardant rnateri-
als,theﬁrewas contained,andtheres—
taurant reopmed the next 

Vic Bovalino, director of operations
for theirestaurant, was not present for
the ﬁre but spoke with oﬂicials from the
health and ﬁre departments 
following the incident;

“Our pizza ovens run about 700 de-
grees, and a small ember was trapped in
an oven brush———whichis an anomaly,
it never happens,’ ’ said Bovalino

“It fell undemeath a storage box
wherewe keep thewood forthe ﬁre”

Because of its steel outer shell and
blown ceramic interior, Bovalino said
there’s no danger of a ﬁre 
from an oven to the restaurant.

“That whole area [around the oven]
isagiant ﬁrebox, soifs setup tocontain
and handle ﬁre,” he said.

Before the restaurant could resume
business, it was  to  dear-
ance from the Allegheny County Health

Department.
“Itwasasmallstructuralﬁreinthe

any of the food service or the integrity
of the establishment,” said Dave Za7ac,
the spokesman for the health depart-
ment.

‘ﬁll of the exposed food was
thrown out, and they opened for busi-
ness the next  ’

The night of the ﬁre, Roy McDon-
ald, chief of Fire Battalion BC2, said he
thought the  was the result of a
wom brick in the pizza oven.

Bovalino 

“I believe the ﬁre chief alluded to
some structural damage in the oven, and
that’s just impossible,” said Bovalino.
“Thetewas nodamageat all”

When asked to comment, the ﬁre
department said only that the ﬁre was
accidental.

In addition to the unanticipated
post-ﬁre inspection W/ednesday,_]une 1 1,
Fuel & Fuddle was also due for a rou-
tine code inspection, which the health
department conducted all at once.

and thatthe emergencylightingwas op-
erational,” said Bovalino __

The restaurant passed each inspec- 
tion and lost only a few hours of busi-
ness the night of the incident. Still, had
the ﬂames been more severe and closed 
the restaurant for longer, Bovalino said a " ’
loss of revenue would be secondary to
safety. .
‘ the 20—plus years I’ve been do-
ing this, in several restaurants, there are
always situations that come up, and the

Upon  the ﬂames, Boval-
ino said his staff evacuated the restau-
rant by moving table to table, alerting the
patrons of the issue and  them to
evacuate. ’

On the whole, Bovalino said he felt
there was no reason to be concerned .'
about the ﬁ1t11re safety of the restau- 
rant, nor anyreason to anticipate further
problems .

Oakland landlords
getting police help‘

by Giles Howard .
Co/ztriéutiqg Editor

Pitt police chief Tim Delaney met
for the first time thisMay with mern-
bers 'of the Oakland Landlord Com-
mittee to address concerns raised by

SernpleFest and to discuss crime pre- '

vention in the area. Bob Eckenrode,
a landlord who has been a member

L of the committee since its inception

this January, wanted to know at the
start ofthe  therewas any
way to stop SernpleFest from hap-
“It’s gotten worse each year,” said
Eckenrode. V y -
Pitt police spokesperson Ron
Bennett was ‘quick to point out that
landlords must  more involved if
disruptions like student parties are to
be prevented in the ﬁiture.
“We can have landlords, police
and tenants  together in the

community —— that’s the point of this

meeting,” said Bennett

Bennett’s assertion informed the

rest of the meeting as Delaney, Ben-
nett and the four landlords in atten-
dance discussed how to reduce crime
and improve resident behavior in
South Oakland. «

Much of the discussion focused

on new ways to communicate the .

consequences of crimes such as un-
derage  to student members
of the South Oakland community
because, as Delaney said, “the plan
that we have is not  _

New ideas includedtaking out ads
in local media,  to theparents
of students and  to students
starting with orientation. T

“We need toadvertise and com-
municate,’7 said Delaney.

The possibility of reducing South
Oakland crime by placing surveillance
cameras in areas that experience bur-
glaries and graﬁﬁti was also raised dur-

John Croumer, an alumnus who _

earned an undergraduate and gradu-

liked  a supermarket in Oakland

“I think it’s awesom ” said

He said this willwork perfectly be-
cause most of his positions will only
be part-time, and most students only
want to work part-time.

The store’s location on thesecond

UPMC first to Warn of cell phone link to cancer

by Drew Singer
N€t('.1 Editor

The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute
issued an advisory July 23 detailing precautions
to take to avoid the potential health risks of cell
phones, the ﬁrst time a US. hospital has issued
such an advisory.

“Although the evidence is still controversial,
I am convinced that there are sufﬁcient data to
warrant issuing an advisory to share some pre-

cautionary advice on cell phone use,” said UPCI
director Dr. Ronald Herberman in the memo
randum.

“The most recent studies, which include sub-
jects with a history of cell phone usage for a du-
ration of at least 10 years, show a possible asso-
ciation between certain  tumors (acoustic
neuromas) and some brain cancers on the side
the device is used,” he said. I

The advisory, which was collaborated by a
23—member committee including three doctors

from the University of Pittsburgh, listed 10 pre-
cautions that cell phone users should take, includ-
ing avoiding usage in areas with a weak  and
not allowing children to use cell phones unless in
emergencies

Arlan Mintz, director of UPMC’s adult neu-
rosurgical oncology program, said that the advi-
sory needed to be issued now, despite the lack of
concrete evidence

“If there’s some evidence that suggests an
increased use of brain cancer among cell phone

users,” he said, “do we take a strong stand now, or
do we wait until we have an established link and
maybe it will be too late?

‘We should be prudent and precautious, it’s
probably the right  to do,” he said. “Brain
tumors don’t happen overnight”

The advisory called on cell phone manufac-
turers to address the health risks their products
might be causing.

“It is their responsibility to provide appliances
and equipment with the lowest possible risk and
to constantly evolve their technology in this direc-
tion,” said the advisory.

Mintz said that cell phone companies have
usage data that, if made available to researchers,
might prove a correlation between degrees of
usage and brain tumors, a link that Mintz said is
inevitable.

“We eventually ﬁgured out that smoking
caused lung cancer, and some of the tobacco
companies still deny it,” he said.

While the advisory specifically warned about
children  exposed to cell phones, college
students are not in the high—1:isk demographic

“The problem with children is the skin over
the scalp, the muscle and bone are thinner, so the
penetration of the electrornagnetic ﬁelds into the
brain is  to be larger,” said Mintz. “The pen—
etration of a college student is  to be very
similar, if not the same, to someone who’s 30 or
40 or 50.”

The advisory said that its purpose was not to
advocate for the total elimination of cell phones,
but to serve as fair  to their users

‘ “Our society will no longer do without cell
phones None of the members on the expert
committee has stopped or intends to stop 
cell phones This includes [Pitt School of Medi-
cine professor] Dr. David Servan—Schreiber, a 16-
year survivor of brain can ” it said

“However, we, the users, must all take precau-
tionary measures in view of recent scientiﬁc data
on the biological effects of cell phone use, espe-
cially those who already have cancer”

In addition to Herberman and Servan-
Schreiber, UPCI Center for Environmental On~
cology director Devra Davis represented Pitt on
the committee Of the 23 doctors on the com-
mittee, two were from the United States and not

‘from Pitt;

Similar advisories have been released in Eu-
rope, but this is believed to be the ﬁrst to be re-
leased by a major health care group in the United
States _ — i

This is the list of advice the advisory provided
to limit exposure to cell phone radiation:

1. Do not allow children to use a cell phone,

‘ except for emergencies The developing organs

of a fetus or child are the most likely to be sensi-
tive to any possible effects of exposure to electro

The poll did use, however, the highest-recorded

cording to the ALA. .

- InthewakeoftheALA’sreport,Pittsburgl'1has
submitted a plan to the EPA to ensure all monitor-
ing sites in the county reach federal standards for
particle pollution. 0 K ,

‘Most of the monitoring sites are meeting air-
pollution standards And we have aeplan to 
the rest of Allegheny County into standards of ﬁne

‘We have Liberty—Clairton by 2015 because

Some owners not happy, I

he said.

Instead of smoking sections and non-
smoking sections, Oakland’ customers will
have to choose between smoking bars and
non—smoking bars.

Peter Leventis, co—owner of Peter’s Pub
on Oakland Avenue, said he makes much
more than 20 percent of his sales from
food. ~ '

“I’m not happy with it, because I think it
should be across the board, not just 20 per-
cent food,” said Leventis.

He said he plans to comply but does not
think it can be enforced in every bar.

“It’s going to be enforced, but I don’t
know how strict at ﬁrst because they don’t
have enough people to do it,” he said.
“There’s over 2,000,liquor licenses in Allegh-
eny County.”

Seth Plyer, a manager at Primanti Broth-
ers, said he thinks the new state law is unfair
and creates an inconvenience for his employ-
ees, who all smoke, except for two.

“It creates an unlevel playing ﬁeld. Now
you can go to some places to smoke but not
others,” he said. “For the drinkers who want
to go,out and smoke, it will certainly send
business to the bars that make less than 20
percent of their sales from food.

“I think it should just be left up to the
individual business owners,” he said.

Chuck Ardo, a spokesperson for Rendell,
said that the law will reduce cases of second-
hand smoke.

“In the most practical terms, it will re-
duce medical costs as fewer Pennsylvanians
are subject to the diseases that exposure to
secondhand smoke causes,” he said.

\While the ban was enacted for health

’ reasons, Ardo said that owners of establish-

ments with low food sales lobbied for their
exemption with ﬁnancial arguments.

Vic Bovalino, director of operations for
Joe Mama’s, Fuel & Fuddle and Uncle Sam’s

Subs, all located on Oakland Avenue, said»

that because this is a statewide ban, he thinks
the ban will not harm hisibusiness.

Ardo said that Rendell would support
attempts in the legislature that would allow
Allegheny County and Scranton to impose

_ their own laws, which couldbe stronger than
. the state’s law. ' I

Both state Sen. jay Costa, D-Allegheny,
and state Rep. Dan Frankel, D—Allegheny,
have publicly said they will push for "legisla-
tion allowing Allegheny County and other

local governments to pass stricter smoking

bans.

Turnout high for networking events

to talk to one another,” said Voinski of his
New York City event, which attracted 75 at-
tendees. _

The idea for the gatherings came from
Alumni Outreach coordinator La.raine 
after a networking event held at Bossa Nova in
Pittsburgh last year.

Pittsburgh was slated as the sole host of the
event but after some thought it changed to in-
clude more locations.

“At a staff meeting, we were  about

different events, and I thought, ‘\Wouldn’t it
be really unique if we had  all around the
country?’’’ said Hlatky.

About 600 people participated in Network-
ing Day, a number the Alumni Association
considered a success.

Associate director of Alumni Outreach
Alyson Kavalukas said she was happy with the
evcnt’s outcome. ‘

“It was a terrific way for alumni to connect
with alumni,” she said. “It was a great oppor-

tunity for people to make professional connec-
tions. It was also great for alumni to promote
Pitt Career Network.”

Plans are now underway to expand the
event to even more cities in the future.

‘‘We’d like it to grow to 20 [locations] next
year,” said  ‘When we met with our
alumni professionals at the regional campuses,
we told them about the event, and next year
they may join in as well. Perhaps even our in-
ternational reps can get in on the act.”

“We extended itas longas we could. Itwas really
popular for young families and kids, but in order to
maintain it and keep providing it, we need the fund-
ing and the revenue’ ’ '

Carousel courts student riders

\V1th its 16 mirrors, rows of yellow light bulbs,
shiny golden posts and wooden ﬂoor, the $300,000
PNC carousel, which was made in \X71chita, Kan,
resides next to the Schenley Plaza Oval and attracts
approximately 500 riders each day.

In fact, Griffin said thejune 27 WYEP concert
brought the daily total up to 2,000 riders

In addition to PN C, Griffin also added that oth-
er people donated as much as $10,000 to $20,000
forthenaming1ightsofaparticularanimal,and
these names will never change .

Riders can see the donors’ names, as well as the
names of the animals, on a bronze plaque on the
floorof the carousel beside each animal.

To ride the carousel, each person must possess

WW3

Four or more tokens can be purchased from a
machine at the carousel’s entrance, which is credit
card friendly, or riders can obtain single tokens at the
Asia Tea House kiosk  the plaza Each token
costs $1.25. .

Tantrums aside, the carousel’s recent tight fund-
ing did littie to slow the demand for rides ﬁtom par-
ents, children and students , . ‘

“Riders are typically kids, with or without their
parentsj’ said McCaule3; noting that the carousel’s

_ close proximity to Carnegie Museum attracts visit-

ing families

Some studdits tide as well, she said, “mostiy stu-
dmts who vowed to ride the carousel before leaving
Pittsburgh or those who are just bored in Oakland

“Ihadatourcomethroughonce,andtheie
have also been several couples  engagement

a plaza lawn in 2006, Pitt StUd€I1lS have come to see
Schenley Plaza as an extension of the campus, a
sentiment Griﬂin encourages

“\X/ewanttohaveagreenspaee forPittstudents
since it’s ‘such an urban campus,’ ’ he said.

“We try.to keep it nice and safe, and we wel-

. come and encourage them to come down.” ‘

McCauley, a Pitt graduate, not only visited the
carousel, she got a job there. H

“It’s part-time, laid back, low pressure, littie re-
sponsibility and outside,” she said.

Landlords offer to install cameras to deter thieves

Landlords, page 62
ing the meeting

Eckenrode asked Delaney if police could
place cameras around South Oakland and of-
fered to have the cameras placed on his proper-
ties

“I’m wonied about kids  home for
Thanksgiving or Chtistmas and their places get
robbed,” said Eckenrode.

He hopes that cameras would deter or help
catch the burglars who stiike during breaks, as
well as the graffiti artists whom he said he has
“been  for years”

Delaney was receptive to the idea and said
that the blue—light emergency boxes and surveil-
lance cameras had not been placed in South
Oakland before because the University doesn’t
own any property in the area.

“Student Government Board has been en-

tertaining the idea of getting more emergency
call boxes in South Oakland,” said SGB presi-
dent Sumter Link.

Link said he supports the installation of
cameras in South Oakland if property owners
are  to have them placed on their build-

Kelly \X/awrzeniak, who works with the
committee as the community organizer at the
Oakland Planning and Development Corpora-
tion, said that she will invite representatives of
SGB to attend the June meeting.

Delaney and Eckenrode expressed interest
in meeting with representatives from SGB. Eek-
enrode said that getting everyone in Oakland
on the same page will help prevent crime in the
area.

Link said that he wants SGB to become in-

volved in discussions with the landlords and Pitt
police in the future.

“Some good has to come out of this: the
fact that we are communicating,” said Delaney.

June Oakland Landlord Committee meet-
iﬂg

Scheduling conﬂicts prevented representa-
tives of the Student Government Board from
attending]une’s meeting of the Oakland Land-
lord Committee.

Wawrzeniak invited board member Ryan
Haddad to the June 25 meeting weeks in ad-
Vance

“We definitely want to get [SGB] on board
for ﬁxture meetings,” said \X/awrzeniak.

Haddad, who could not attend the meeting
because of his full—time job Downtown, for-
warded the invitation to board member Ryan
Very, who also could not attend.

About half the board is in Pittsburgh for the
summer, but full—time jobs and course work pre-
vented board members from attending.

Haddad expressed interest in attending fu-
ture meetings but will be unable to attend ]uly’s
because he will be on vacation with his family.

“It’s important that SGB be in attendance to
serve as a voice for the students in these discus-
sions,” said Haddad..

Haddad said that landlords and student ten-
ants must talk to one another

“Unless both parties are able to sit down and
have a fair, honest discussion, very little can be
ﬁxe .”

Last semester, Haddad started to work to
resolve problems with mail delivery in South
Oakland. -

Haddad said that students were  their
mail stolen because their houses in South Oak-
land lacked the proper facilities to keep mail se-
cure.

“Off—campus students deserve the safe and
secure  that they were afforded on cam-
pus,” said Haddad. —

Cameras not to be in South Oakland

Pitt police spokesman Ron Bennett said that
the Pitt police will not be placing surveillance
cameras on private property in South Oakland
because of problems  placing University
equipment on private property.

For the same reason, the placement of
emergency call boxes in South Oakland is also
on hold. '

Games unite cross—state rivals to support organ donation

Transplant Games, page 68
— but it gets into your blood You make so
many new friends,” she said. ‘

\Xf1th the exception of the popular and elu-
sive alien pin ﬁrom New Mexico, a crab pin from
Maryland and a few others, Goughnour amassed
nétrly a complete set

But her favorites, which were a peach and
a live oak tree from Team  she pinned
near her left shoulder,  like a plum line
from the lanyard to the heart she received two
years ago from a young woman in Atlanta.

“I was just so blessed,” said Goughnour.
Monica Herr, a senior majoring in political sci-

ence and urban studies at Pitt; volunteered at the
expo and saw firsthand what the event meant
for the attendees

“I had never heard of [the Games] before,
but a friend of mine works at UPMC and told
me about it,” said Herr. ,

“Everybodyfs so wonderful. Theyre out
 pins, communicating It’s great And
the Hawaii people?” said Herr, picking up the
lei around her neck “These are real, and they
brought them all the way here to  out”

Pittsburgh, thanks to the innovations of
Dr Thomas Starzl and his colleagues who per-

formed the first liver transplant at UPMC in
1981, has long been a leader in transplant sur-
839’-

According to UPMC’s Transplantation Ser-
vices Web site, “more than 12,000 transplants
have been performed at UPMC Presbyterian

Athletes competed in  racquetball,

“It’s more about camaraderie than competi-

last night, and we schmoozed the whole time.”

Wayne Meyers, a Team Pittsburgh athlete

L. Breaking down Fall Break

While the newly created fall break initiated
by SGB will occur on a Monday, students will
actually miss the classes. scheduled for that Tues-

No classes will meet on Monday, Oct 13,
but all Monday classes scheduledfor that day
will meet the next day, Tuesday, Oct 14, instead.
All classes scheduled for that Tuesday are cah-
celed, a memo ﬁomthe Office of the Univer-
sity Registrar saidl ,

“The shifting of Monday classes to Tuesday
and the canceling of Tuesday classes during the
week of fall break may be conﬁlsing at first,” the
memo said. “However, the experience at other
institutions seems to be that this works as long
as everyone is well informed of the changes.”

In past years, Tuesday classes have met 15
times throughout the fall semester, while there
were 14 class days for all other weekdays, thanks
to Labor Day and  Break, which is
always a Wednesday through Sunday furlough.

Programs not following the academic calen-
dar — including professional degree programs
—— are not affected by the break. ,

All University buildings will remain open,
and University staff does not: receive a day off
of work,  the exception of those who do
not normally work on Mondays.

SGB president Sumter Link said he was
happy to see the break take effect in time for

the fall. "

‘The calendarwas so ﬁxed already, there was
very little ﬂexibility with it I’m very pleased with
the provost office and the calendar committee
to work around the limited flexibility,” he said.

Link said he would like to see the break ex-

2. While communicating  your cell
phone, try tokeep the cell phone away from the
body as much as possible The amplitude of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld is one—fourth the strength
at a distance of 2 inches and.50 times lower at 3
feet

Whenever possible, use the speaker—phone
mode or a wireless Bluetooth headset; which has
less thanl percent of the electromagnetic emis
sion of a normal cell phone Use of a hands—free
earpiece attachment might also reduce exposures

3. Avoid using your cell phone in places, like
a bus, where you can passively expose others to
your phone’s electromagnetic ﬁelds y

4. Avoid  your cell phone on your
body at all times Do not keep it near your body
at night, such as under the pillow or on a bedside
table, particularly if pregnant You can also put it
on “ ’ t” or “off—line” mode, which stops elec-
tromagnetic emissions

5. If you must carry your cell phone on you,
make sure that the keypad is positioned toward
your body and the back is positioned toward the
outside so that the transmitted electromagnetic

ﬁelds move away from you rather than through I

you.

6. Only use your cell phone to establish con-
tact or for conversations  a few minutes,
as the biological effects are directly related to the
duration of exposure For longer conversations,
use a landline with a corded phone, not a cordless
phone, which uses electromagnetic  tech-
nology similar to that of cell phones

7. Switch sides regularly while communicating
on your cell phone to spread out your exposure
Before putting your cell phone to the ‘ear, wait un-
til your correspondent has picked up This limits
the power of the electromagnetic ﬁeld emitted
near your ear and the duration of your exposure

8. Avoid using your cell phone when the signal
is weak or when moving at high speed, such as in
a car or train, as this automatically increases power
to a maximum as the phone repeatedly attempts
to connect to a new relay antenna

9. When possible, communicate through text
messaging rather than making a call,  the
duration of exposure and the proximity to the
body-

10. Choose a device with the lowest SAR
possible (SAR is the “speciﬁc absorption rate,”
which is a measure of the strength of the mag-
netic ﬁeld absorbed by the body). SAR ratings of
contemporary phones by different manufacturers
are available by searching for “SAR  cell

The Pitt News is keeping its ﬁngers crossed this year "

As summer slowly comes to a close, students gear up

, for classes and professors busily prepare syllabi. Mean-
? while, The Pitt News has come up with its annual wish
: list Some are new desires, others are repeated yet long-
i unheeded, requests We only hope that Pitt takes notice

W'ish#1:OnlineSehedulingandOnlineAdd/Drop

V_V1th swift advancements in technology and the Uni-
versit}/s gradually rising status, it’s truly shocking that Pitt

’ has not yet implemented online class scheduling In this
f respect, Pitt is  behind almost every other univer-
, sity inthe country.

The current system requests that students meet with
adviserstoenrollinclassesWhileweseethebeneﬁts of

3 regular advising, we believe that it’s largely unnecessary.

' Students can make the right decisions on their own. On-
line scheduling is obviously working at other universities.

There’s no reason it can’t work here.

If regular advising is of great importance to Pitt of-
ficials, we don’t have to lose it with the implementation

‘ of online scheduling. Pitt can ask that students meet with
: advisers before they sign up for classes This way, we can
; have the best of both worlds

However, if online scheduling is too much too soon,

: we’re willing to take baby steps. Perhaps Pitt can start by
 allowing students to simply drop and add classes online
. Currently, the paper-based system we have is convoluted
i and useless, unnecessarily  the time of students

and staff.  add/ drop weelg the line at Thackeray
Hall can stretch out the door, and the long wait to drop a
course can feel like the endless wait at the DMV to get a
drivefs license.

Oftcntimes, science majors have to wait in line for
hours on end, early in the morning, to ensure their en-

a try into a popular and required course. But with online

scheduling, this problem can be eliminated and students
can get some sleep.

In the meantime, it would be greatly appreciated if
someone could move the green add/ drop forms from

 the second floor of Thackeray down to the add/ drop
7 room on the first ﬂoor. Seriously

Welcome, faithful readers, to the

“the best section” — of The Pitt
News. The opinions section is where

stay safe Part of that responsibility is  SafeR- you can read all about the perspec-
ider to reach more neighborhoods in and around Oak- tives of fellow students on various is-
land sues  from local to national to

Many students live in Shadyside and Squirrel Hill,
areas not completely covered by SafeRider: This is lu-
dicrous, especially because SafeRider goes as far as
Chatham College Pitt should not only expand coverage
to these neighborhoods, but also it should employ more
phone operators and obtain more shuttles so that more
students can take advantage of the SafeRider service

We understand that expansion costs money, but with
responsible planning and budgeting, it is a reasonable re-
quest. And if it will guarantee students’ safety, it’s a wor-
thy investment.

W1sh#3: rass theUSATodayReadershipProgi-am

Last semester, 56 percent of 3,269 students voted
“yes” in a Student Government Board—issued refer-
endurn to adopt the USA Today Readership Program,
which would bring the USA Today and The New York
Times to campus every day for an annual fee of $5 per
student. But the Student Government Board decided
against it, saying that while the majority was in favor, it
was only a small majority. -
We’re asking SGB to reverse this decision and listen to
the majority, although small, of voters who want the
USA Today and The New York Times within reach ev-
ery day-

Five dollars a year is a small price to pay to stay up-to-
date and informed about current events While these
newspapers are available online, more students are likely
to read them when they are close at hand Furthermore,
the program not only offers newspapers but also brings
valuable CEO job fairs to campus, thus increasing job
opportunities for students. ‘

Well, there you have it! We’re  our ﬁngers crossed;
the rest is up to Pitt.

The editorial cartoon,’ located
right next to our editorial, usually
conveys a politicalor social message

You can also read the unique
opinions of our columnists, who
write about a variety of subjects in-

Turkish secularism is a model for America

    

by Giles Howard
Colummiu‘

 
 

After centuries of inquisi-

U tions, witch burnings and cru-

Isades, you’d think that the West
would realize that the separation
of church and state is important
to a healthy and free society.
You’d be wrong.

Be it through the display of
the Ten Commandments outside
of courthouses, the recitation of a
monotheistic pledge of allegiance
or the absurd exercise in religious
pandering that our presidential

,‘ election has become, the principle

of separation of church and state
is mocked in this nation daily.

So when I look for an example
of vibrant secularism, I do not
look at my own nation but instead
to the Middle East, where Musta-
fa Kemal Ataturk established the
secular Turkish Republic in 1923.

The founding of the Turkish
Republic might seem to be an ob-
scure and, for a U.S. college read-

I ership, pointless issue to bring up

in a column, but Turkey is one of
the most successful examples of
secular government in the world.

Politicians in our country might
get away with opposing abortion
or same-sex marriage on religious
grounds, but legislators in Turkey
have been executed in the past for
undermining the Turkish secular
tradition.

We could learn something
from Ataturk’s Turkey.

When Ataturk founded the
Turkish Republic, it was an inter-
national backwater. A remnant
of the Ottoman Empire, Turkish
social and political structure was
heavily dependent on Muslim in-
stitutions and laws.

But when Ataturk came to
power, he introduced sweeping re-
forms. He ended the Caliphate, in-

clerics.

The progress experienced .by
Turkey should serve as an exam-
ple not only to the Middle East
but also to Western nations who
have forgotten the lessons of the
Enlightenment.

The secular foundation of the
Turkish Republic has only been
protected by a vigilant military
willing to intervene in political af-
fairs and a class of elites who are

itary should depose governments
at will — the Turkish military has
overthrown four governments
since 1960 — but I am saying
that, in a nation where more than
50 percent of the population be-
lieves that the world was created
in six days, we should be wary of
accepting the will of the majority.

The Turkish system has its
flaws. It’s extremely ethnocentric
and paranoid. However, the Turk-

troduced ish pres-
new civil ident
and e-  never in-
nal coges vaded a
Efjgfpcfn“  in a nation where more than 50 ;:j;:: ‘
.....1.1. percent of the population believes God
anldddfhs; that the world was created in six tolflhim
:;;;;.. ° days we should be wa_ry_of accept- ° {?h:°'
 ing the will of the majority. ironic
He -  part
even P ’ of this
banned whole
traditional issue
religious is that

styles of dress in an attempt to
completely separate Turkish soci-
ety from its past Islamic culture.
Ataturk’s secular reforms made
Turkey a regional success story.
Unlike other Middle Eastern na-
tions, Turkish interests have never
been subordinated to the West by
puppet dictators, nor has Turkey’s
progress been inhibited by a suc-
cession of monarchs and their pet

more loyal to Ataturk’s memory
than to the will of the majority.

Whereas the interests of lib-
erty have consistently fallen prey
to the ignorance of the masses in
this country, the Turkish military
and political elite have been suc-
cessful in _combating what Alexis
de Tocqueville called the “tyranny
of the majority.”

I’m not saying that the U.S. mil-

Ataturk based his reforms on the
Enlightenment principles of men
such as Thomas Jefferson and
Thomas Paine, men who founded
this nation. The United States
must reconnect with our Enlight-
enment roots.

But regrettably, just as the Unit-
ed States has forgotten the teach-
ings of men such as Jefferson and
Paine, the Turks have abandoned

BUMPER STICKER

the hard line of Ataturk’s reform.
The ruling Justice and Develop-
ment Party of Turkey has actively
rolled back the secular protections
that have made Turkey such a suc-
cess story.

Members of the Turkish mili-
tary have recently been arrested
for plotting a coup against the
Islamist party whose very exis-
tence is a violation of separation
of church and state. But a coup in
defense of liberty is not a crime.

I hope that the Turks will come
to their senses and, regardless of
world opinion, dissolve this new
party that has betrayed secular-
ism.

The example of a secular Turk-
ish republic is too important to
progress in the region and around
the world for it to be destroyed.

Indeed, as we proceed through
this election year we must reﬂect
on whether we want a president
who will pander to the publicly
religious or one who will uphold
the memory of our founding and
deny religion a place in the public
sphere.

Let Americans have their pri-
vate faiths just as the Turks have
theirs. But if the United States is
to once again assume a position
of ascendance in world affairs, it
is reason alone that must guide
our decisions.

i'Apparently summer is the time 7

for road construction in Oakland, no

doubt to make things easier for Pitt
,1 students, who will  dominate

the streets come fall. ,
 however, makes  con-
" siderably not easier for summer stu?
dents at Pitt;

I therefore recount‘  you 

brief story of an qnfortunate-(‘little
girl named Polly.Brown as a 
to all those who dare walk the twisty,
manholed streets of Oakland in th

sumrnertime: A A

‘Polly, as happy, carefree. girl, had

thought she was a pro at 
foad construction. After all, she grew
up under the jurisdiction of the Penn-
sylvania, Department of Transporta-
‘ tion, or PennDot proud organizer
of the most incoherent construction
procedures ever. And according to
Darwinism, we adapt to extreme situ-
ations.‘ Kind of like how after eight

years under the Bush adrninist:ratior1,.

people have become really, really good

  

 

at interpreting unintelligible speech.
Unfortunately,  Avenue does
not have nearly the same consistency

as Bush’s grammar.

Things seemedto start off well
for Polly, who began her trek at the
intersection. of Fifth and Tennyson S
avenues Not far along, however, she
encountered a smattering of  or-
3086 Yidd Signs that had bedl draped
with gray tarps

Naively, Polly assumed that 
meant the construction was ﬁnished V
——e‘fWhy else conceal such tasteful
street decor?” she reasoned — and .
continued down the sidewalk, unsus-
pecting, only to be bombarded no
more than 50 feet later by a deluge of

fresh orange Orange cones, plastic
- orange fencing, orange blinking lights

and, of course, large uncovered or-
angeyidd Signs ' ‘
There was so much orange that

poor Polly could no ‘longer tell which

orange to acknowledge and which or-
angel to ignore * t A .
"And amid this sea of ﬂashing
color rose a great  a monument
really, like the \Washington Capitol
of construction, reading, “SIDE-

sign for

WALK CLOSED ——- USE OTHER
SID .” . . »

Well, easierread than done. Like in
all great stories, things just can’t be that
simple ‘

power, failed to considerwas that_

there was no crosswalk connecting to
this distant land of “other side”

This left Polly with two options:
double back or follow the stream

E of people who chose to ignore the

orange —_ god bless them —— and
continue ofiward, without fear of
potholes or whatever else is indicated
by a ﬂashing “DANGER” 

Ohdear,thisdoesrnakethi_ngsdifﬁ-

cult for our heroine, doesn’t it? . , , .

Polly‘ looked ahead, then behind,
then across the street “Gosh! This

' is the hardest work I’Ve had to do all

da ,” she lamented before finally mak-
ing her decision. ,

Perhaps it was tlneﬂashing lights
or her sudden lack of hope that she
would leave this venture unscathed,
but she continued forward.

As she approached the University
bookstore, she began to notice an odd
phenomenon. The group of people

 

 

who  front of her
was  “Where had they gone?”
she wondered. “Did they fall into the

manhole? Had the orange consumed

thern?”

Unfortunately, the answer. was
worse than both of those two possi-
bilities combined. To the side of the

' roped-0E area, she finally spotted the

group hastily  down the bus
lane with sad looks of futility on their
faces, no doubt knowing that at any
moment the 71D could come whiz-
zing by and end it all '

“Where was the sign to warn me
about this, huh? Nowhere” she spat,
literally onto the street —— for Polly
was a crude, savage type of 
. She supposed the construction
company must have been too ern—

c barrassed to, make one After all,

what would it say, “SIDE\Y/ALK
CLOSED —— USE BUS LANE”?

\3_(71th no other options, Polly be-
gan to lower herself under the metal
barner separating the sidewalk from
the street D" _

Still, this story might have had a
happy ending if Polly wasn’t such a
klutzy, uncoordinated  She was

 

. . ,   

not very flexible and “had the harm
 of an 80-year-old woman,” a
physician once told her:

frantically looking around the street
like the weakest member of a herd of
antelope  hunted by lions, won-

bus lane must, “Can the Port Author-

That might have been the end~

right there,.but our Polly is nothing if

not resilient and she’d be darnnedlii-*

she let those construction  win.
Slowly and painfully, she dug her

pulled her broken body up Fifth Av’-

out of sight, she reached the sidewalk,
where she was found by a couple of

answered by me, raised some
questions of my own. Well, just
one actually: If we as a country
were to build another monument
to our “great” presidents, post-
Teddy Roosevelt, whom would it
feature? ‘

As I pondered this question,
another arose in my mind; If we
had to elect a president’ based
on his or her potential for “Mt.
Rushmore—ness,” what kind of
qualities would that person have?

A very knowledgeable friend
of mine, who also happens, to
be a historian-in-training, once
said‘ that she did not believe there

would ever be another “great’
president. I honestly don’t re-"

member why ,she thought that,
but I can guess. It’s probably ‘be-
cause the four men featured on
Mt. Rushmore were beyond pres-

idential. They were revolutionar-

ies. '
Washington was indisputably
rebellious, you know, with the
_RevolutionaryWa_randeverything.

Jefferson focused on exploring
_ the-front:ier of the United States,

and'Roosevelt on protecting it.

Karadzic trial a victory  forhypocracy

    

by Giles Howard
Columruitt

 

The arrest of former Serbian -

president Radovan Karadzic on

i charges of war crimes has sent or-

gasmic shivers through the liberal
community. . H
The editorial board of The

t ' New York Times was gushing with

bleeding—heart optimism when
it wrote, “Mr. Karadzic’s capture
. should serve ‘as a warning to
other leaders who incite and abet
genocide and believe they can rely
on their neighbors’ complicity and
the world’s. inattention to escape
justice.”
Yes, the arrest of a former

president of an Eastern European
-  nation ‘on charges of war crimes

has sent a message to leaders in
Britain, the United States, Rus-
sia and‘China that human rights
abuses, war crimes and genocide
will no longer be tolerated by the
international community

Or maybe the arrest of Kara— I

dzic will change absolutely noth-

 

ing. ' '

To give Karadzic’s case some
international context let’s consider
the fact that George W Bush has
directed a campaign of torture for
the last seven years, killed hun-
dreds of thousands of civilians

in two wars and_ will

American liberals enjoy little more
than seeing the defunct leaders of
second and third world countries
go on trial for crimes against their
own people.

Of course, such justice doesn’t _

extend to the leaders of industri-

See the difference?

Unlike The Times, I won’t be
celebrating the capture and extradi-
tion of Karadzic, because until the
leaders of ﬁrst—world nations are
held accountable for their crimes,
the ICC is simply a manifestation

of an international dou-

never ‘have to face
international justice.
He doesn’t need his
neighbors’ complic-
ity .or the world’s in-
attention as long as
he lives in a country
with a nuclear arse-
nal.

The War in Iraq
has led to more ci-

rge W. Bush has

years... and will never have

ble standard rather 
international justice.

I understand
that the world will feel
better when Karadzic
is’ safely ensconced in
his Dutch cell. After all,
the world stood by and
watched thousands of
Bosnians sacrificed at
the altar of Serb nation-

Vilian deaths than
Karadzic’s cam-
paign of ethnic cleansing or Omar
al—Bashir’s campaign in Darfur,
but you’ll never see the ICC, indict
members of the Bush administra-
tion for their role in the deaths of

. Iraqis.

So why is The New York
Times so excited about the arrest

of Karadzic? Probably because

alized nations. When leaders of
industrialized nations murder ci-
vilians it’s called a humanitarian in-
tervention or a peace-keeping mis-
sion, because civilized leaders just
don’t kill thousands of civilians
out of ethnic prejudice ... they kill
hundreds of thousands of civilians
in the name of national interest.

   

alism and did nothing.
That has to in-
spire some sort of guilt.

But this sort of international
“justice,” whereby leaders are in-
dicted for their genocidal crimes
only after they’ve unfolded live on
CNN, constitutes more of an ex-
ercise in international theater than
an exercise in criminal procedure.

' The difference between the

  

two is that theater is entertaining
to the American left, whereas ex-
ercising justice tends toireveal ugly
skeletons in our liberal closets. I
mean, didn’t we liberals support
Mugabe as a paragon of anti—colo-
nial virtue? Haven’t we supported‘
the very ethnic nationalism that’s
caused such misery in the Balkans
and around the world? We even
supported Bill Clinton in his sanc-
tions regime against Iraq that led
to the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi chil-
dren in the 1990s.

These are things that we’d most
likely not want to see aired in some
courtroom in the Netherlands.
But untilwe own up to these past
crimes and put our criminal lead-I

ers on trial right next to Serbia’s, ‘

we might as well let Karadzic go,
because to prosecute him while
refusing to confront world leaders
of nations that actually matter is
shameful.

Anyway, this is why I no longer
read The New York Times editori-
als.

by Josh Green

Colum/ultt

    

In case you hadn’t heard, ‘Oliver
7Stone will be releasing a ﬁlm called
“W” in October. Pronounced “dub-
ya,” this film will detail the events of
our current presidenfs life leading
up to his eight-year stay in the White
House. Based on the teaser trailer, it
looks like an interesting ﬁlm. Dubya
will ﬁst ﬁght with his father, get drunk
in bars and chase hot chicks.

And surely the fact that the ﬁlm is
set for an October release, a month
before the election, is meant to have
some political impact Stone prob-
ably wants to remind people what we
ended up with in 2000 and what we
dealt with for eight years before we
step into the voting booth.

It is questionable whether or not
this ﬁlm will do well. Will people ig-
nore it or ﬂock to it?

In my opinion, the odds are not
stacked in Stone’s favor. Is he not
aware that an epic Bush biopic has

already been released during the sum-

-mer?

“The Dark Knight” was clearly
a ﬁlm meant to explore the heroism
of George W Bush and his decisions

Throughout recent U.S. his-
tory, many have maintained the
belief that the American youth
are an apathetic demographic
that does not truly care about the
political direction that the United
States takes. '

Although that notion is surely
a controversial one, as the Ameri-
can youth have often been at the
forefront of many of the most
signiﬁcant social and political
movements during the 20th and
21st centuries, perhaps that wide-
spread belief can be attributed to
another critical part of the United
States: the economy.

During the late 20th cen-
tury, one Of the greatest hip-

hop groups ever assembled, the.

Wu Tang Clan, released a track
that propelled them to stardom.
“C.R.E.A.M.,” or “Cash Rules

. Everything Around Me,” was

the track that raised the Wu Tang
Clan to iconic status in the hip-

 

hop community. The song was
and continues to be one of the

‘most popular tracks in hip-hop,

a culture largely populated by the
American youth. -

It seems, though, that those
youth have yet to realize the sig-
niﬁcance of the message behind
the track’s name: the all-impor-
tant role that theeconomy plays
in not only the United States but
also the international commu-
nitY-

Despite being old enough and
mature enough to manage the
daily routines of our own lives,
many college students are un-
aware and uninformed of eco-
nomic markets, Economics is of-
ten an overlooked topic for most
college—aged students for numer-
ous reasons.

Although many college stu-

—dents maintain jobs during the

school year and the summer,
much of the money that is ac-
cumulated through such jobs is
often immediately translated into
tuition, books, rent and other
items and liabilities of the sort.

Rarely is any money that is
made through summer jobs and
part—time jobs invested in any

sort of stock or bond. Accord- '

ingly, the inability for many young
people to be directly involved in
the markets turns them away

' from the sector entirely.

Notwithstanding not be-
ing “real” members of society
who bring in consistent income
necessary to be involved in the
investment markets, an interest-
ing phenomenon has occurred
throughout the past six months.

In March 2008, the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette reported that the
economy had replaced the war in
Iraq as the most important issue
in the 2008 presidential election.
Although the American youth
were previously perceived as be-
ing disconnected from the U.S.
economy, it appears that many
young Americans, including my-
self, share much of the same sen-
timents and concerns that older,
working Americans hold.

With increasing prices in food,
gas andyenergy, cause for concern

appears to be very high with an
age group that generates no real
income. Not only because those
increased prices will take away
from money available for spend-
ing, but because it appears that
the current economic recession
— and yes, it is a recession —
might affect the availability of
jobs and housing, as well as op-
portunities for economic growth
post-graduation. _

As commodity prices continue
to skyrocket and the economy
continues its decirnating down-
ward spiral, questions arise as to
how the current economic status
in the United States will affect the
presidential election in the fall.
Ultimately, it is clear that the eco-
nomic conditions that the United
States is currently experiencing
cannot continue.

Yet as the polls tighten be-
tween senators John McCain and

' Barack Obama for front-runner

status, there appears to be uncer-
tainty whether the economic funk
that we are currently experienc-
ing will end soon or will continue

through the next four years.

In the Post-Gazette’s report,
the majority of the young Ameri-
cans interviewed stated that they
disagreed with and were upset by
the economic policies of the Bush
administration. Yet what might
be more upsetting and unsettling
is that those economic policies,
which directly contributed to the

4-.0

recession we are all unfortunately

experiencing, will be perpetuated
under a conservative administra-
tion.

Although nothing is certain
until November when the elec-
tion takes place, the result of the
presidential election will surely
reﬂect whether young Americans
truly understand the importance
of the fact that “Cash Rules Ev-
erything Around Me.” Will they
vote to make the appropriate
changes in order to stimulate the
U.S. economy, or will they vote to
continue and potentially exacer-
bate the current economic reces-
sion?

In its attempt to prepare for the
upcoming Olympic Games, 
has endeavored to clean up its air pol-
lution, its humanitarian policies and,
now, its own citizens

To accomplish this, the city gov-
ernment issued 36-page booklets to
more than 4 million  house-
holds, which advised citizens on prop-
er etiquette and dress code: limited use
of colors, no white socks with black
shoes, no horizontal stripes for over-
weight people and absolutely no paja-
mas, according to an Associated Press
t‘€pO1't.

Among other restrictions the
booklet entailed were no public spit-
ting, no public displays of affection,
no garlic so as to prevent bad breath,
feet should be positioned a few inches
apart and in the shape of a “V” or
“Y,” no handshakes  for more
than three seconds and no  for-
eigners about their age, marital status,
income, past experience, address, per-
sonal life, religious beliefs or political

beliefs

_ Ihaveaproblemwiththesere—
SlIlCl.‘lOI1S, but it’s not with the pajama
or spitiingbans, orevenwith thealzr
surdly specific posture constraints

Althoughldothinkitwouldbe a
little over the top, and- certainly not the
finest example of China’s supposed
humanitarian “progress,” to enforce
these resttictions, I respect that China
is a culture that places great emphasis
on conformity, and to attempt to cri-
tique that from a heavily individualistic
Western perspective isn’t really fair.

It’s clear that the motivation for
the dress and etiquette code is to en-
sure that the city and its citizens reﬂect
Chinainagoodlight.Thisisacountry

that, to understate, has its problems -

withw0rldimageAndIhavet3oask,
is encouraging one’s citizens to be
on their best behavior while under
the world microscope such a terrible
I hate to say it, but some Ameri-
cans — myself included — could use
a book on etiquette.

What does bother me is the restric-
tion on interactions with foreigners
After all, I thought the whole point of

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

' the Olympics was to interact with and

embrace those of different cultures.

According to the Olympic Charter,
the goal of the Olympic Games is to
“place sport at the service of the har-
monious development of man, with
a view to promoting a peaceful soci-
ety concerned with the preservation
of human dignity  whichrequires
mutual understanding with a spirit of
ﬁiendship, solidarity and fair play.”

By  these codes, however,
the Chinese government is in fact

stripping its citizens of those possibili- «

ties How can one get past prior biases
and misconceptions of other cultures
without  questions about the
other persons life?

And with such vague topic restric-
tions as “past experience” and “per-
sonal life,” what is there left to talk
about?

According to Zheng Mojie, deputy

director of the Office of Capital Spiri- '

tual Civilization Construction Com-
mission, the goal of these limitations
was to create a “sound cultural and
social environment . . . for the success
of the  Olympic Games”
More like a culturally and socially

devoid environment

Not only do these restrictions
prevent  citizens from leaming
about those of other nations, but they
keep the rest of the world from leam—
ing more about Chinese citizens and
culture.

If China" is trying‘ to change its‘

world  wouldn’t the best way be
by allowing its citizens to speak openly
and candidly, to show that the Chinese
are just people like anyone else?

Instead, outsiders are left feeling

evenmore oﬁiputbywhat some might
consider “1 984”-esque policies (espe-
cially the eerie way citizens are asked
to repeat  and  the slogan,

ons only hinder its image

hide so  that it won’t allow its
own citizens to speak freely?”

Mojie assures us, “Such 
and educational activities are now grad-
ually irnprovinglives of  For
example, now you’ll find more smiling
faces and people are more properly
and elegantly dress .” How, though,
can the rest of the world truly believe
things have progressed, especially
when a city has been silenced and can-
not speak for itself? '

The mere  of smiling, well-
dressed Beijingers won’t be enough to

change foreigners’ negative opinions

Even listening to it now, I’m dis-
tracted by the quickened beat of my

heart, like little birds are beating in- -

side my chest, and I’m filled with the
desire to jump out of my chair and
on to this little cafe table and sing
out in a ﬂourish of unrestrain_ed,
sequined majesty that accompanies
only the best of the “best of.”

It was “Don’t Let the Sun Go
Down on Me” that I was 
of the night when I witnessed a very
informative interaction between the
author and environmentalist Rick
Bass and a woman I’ve affection-
ately  Old Lady. V

- I was at a Seattle book reading
by Bass, who is a prolific writer of
both fiction and essays, and who has
written a new collection of nonfic-
tion about his long-time home in
the Yaak Valley of Montana. The
Yaak Valley is a sparsely populated
area in northwest Montana that has
been the focus of many environ-
mental preservation efforts because
of its diverse ecosystem and beauti-

bears there. ' _
Old Lady was also in the audi-
ence, an image of youth and vital-
ity in a bright yellow sweatshirt and
matching trucker hat. Yes, trucker
hat. Both items advertised a Yaak
Valleytavern, and —after I mentally
forgave Old Lady for breaking the
cardinal rule of book-signings and
concerts —— never wear the art-
ist’st merchandise to the event + I

tuned right in to what she was ask-

ing Bass. .

She was  about 
in the Valley. ,

It seems that Old Lady’s husband
was an engineer in Libby, Mont,
another well-known‘ area, famous
not for its lovely wildlife" but for the
superfund site thatlis dedicated to
cleaning up the asbestos left in the
soil from a vermiculite  op-
eration there After Old Lady read
one of Bass’ books about Yaak Val-
ley, she asked her husband to pilot
her over the Valley, and after the
ﬂight the couple was informed that
they were lucky not to have been
shot down by marijuana growers.

- Elton John makes everything better

I chuckled at this. It’s not every

'._ day that you hear a really old lady

in a trucker hat  about weed,
but after my warmhearted giggle,
I took a look at Bass and noticed
that there was no humor in his face
And I wondered, who isn’t amused
by Old Lady? What kind of person
doesn’t at least smile at that?

Bass just looked tired; Not
tired in the sleepy way or the out-
too -long-in-the—sun way or even

the Seattle-caffeine-crash way. He‘

looked tired in-the “I have spent the
last 20years trying to preserve one
comer of the earth — a corner that
I see as a microcosm of the ‘entire
world — and it hasn’t been enough
and how can I know that and be
here?” Way. Along with that tired
comes the  thought that
if what we’ve put into something
feelslike everything,.and that just
hasn’t been enough, then nothing
will ever be enough.

Of course, I am being specula- A

But what seemed like the prob-

_ lem to me was that Bass had let the

sun go down on him.

I was concerned for Bass, and
not just because he writes good
short ﬁction. It was more that I was
worried that if someone who\could
be held up as a symbol of this coun-
try’s desire for action could look so

browbeaten, what does that mean.

for the movement itself? Is Bass
emblematic of a general feeling that
working toward good just isn’t cut-
tingit?

Very rarely in my capacity as ex-
cellent-advice-giver have I recom-
mended  to a funny looking
guy in a sparkly jumpsuit and pink
sunglasses for inspiration, but in the
case of Bass, I wish I had. I wish
that I had gone up «to him during

my “I’m on a roadtrip!” spiel, I had

 You can ﬁt 100  in the
space it takes to hold 20 Americans.
 Partly because Americans are way fat-
 ter. But also, Iatinos feel comfortable
1 with less personal space. Here is a
‘I situation that happens every day here:

But then the well-heeled business

side me both chuckle and press into
themass until we, too, become a part
of it all. People even clear a path to let
the pregnant lady sit down.

Inside the train, I count that I’m
touching at least eight people at the
same time And the Argentines, they
just laugh and make obvious com-
ments to ease tension, “A lot of
people, no?” “Ay!” ‘-‘Look at all the
people” “That’s a loﬂ” ,

How would this situation unfold
in the United States? Americans
wouldn’t even stand for this sort of
 in an evacuation We’d be
indignant and obsessed with 
pickpockets or nervously trying to re-

call the facts aboutT.B transmission. i
Also, if you’re American, you’ll

know what I mean when I say that a
lady with eye makeup and a Tweety
Bird sweatshirt would start pushing
and  people “buster.” _
The American idea is: “Give us

I believe Americans don’t dance
because to learn to dance, you occa-
sionally make a motion that looks stu-

When Americans do actually

dance, it’s an athletic event, and if

we dance with other people, it’s a’

“battie,” a competition. Our dances
— C-\X/alking, Hatiem Shake, Hard-
core  Crumping -— are ways
to show off strength, stamina and re-
ﬂex, not to experience how you can

make something pretty even with a’

total stranger.

Compare our dances with tango,
salsa, meringue and even the cumbia
from slums and you’ll see the dilfer—
ence in ethos: They’re  rela-

Still,  these social taxes
isn’t so much a criticism of America
as an affirmation of how smart the
United States has. been to open our

doors Immigrants shock us at first’ i

But as they run through our melt-

add in their own customs that make
no sense That process, more than
our norms and habits, might be our
proudest tradition of all.

Fifty—one thousand jobs were
lost in July, and the average price
for a gallon of gas is hovering
around $4. Unfortunately, the
current national dialogue focuses
on whether. Congress will open
up the United States’ shores to oil

drilling and if Alaska’s national ,

parks should be tapped. Yet, this
discussion is rooted in bygone
technology, and offers no long-

term solution as to how to transi-

tion away from fossil fuels. Let’s

; reject the lazy politics of offshore.
C ‘drilling and similar backward so-

lutions to embracean energy rev-
olution in the United States that
will create jobs, technology and

‘establish us as the 21 st century

energy capital of the world.

The economy is currently spi-
raling downward in the face of
inﬂation, high—energy prices and
theloss of a manufacturing sec-
tor. By starting a federally funded
program to research, develop and



construct the energy technology
of tomorrow, the economy will
be strengthened in the immediate
and long term. Not since the in-
dustrial revolution has the United
States had an opportunity to take
control of future industry in th

world. * ‘

There is substantial potential
to emerge as the global leader in
green technology. But if the cur-
rent talk about our energy crisis
doesn’t expand beyond where to
drill for oil, the United States will
miss out on a chance to stabilize
both the economy and the energy
sector.

The recent discourse of off-
shore drilling to lower gas prices
is misleading and bad policy. Ac-
cording to NPR, “The Depart-
ment of Energy says there may be
18 billion barrels of oil in coastal
waters, but they also say that
drilling for it would not have a
signiﬁcant impact on production
or prices until 2030.” This means
that if Congress removes the ban
on offshore drilling tomorrow,
despite its current recess, there

will be no decrease in the cost of
gasoline until 2030.

What’s the point of perusing‘

such backward policy? It’s obvi-
ously politically convenient since
intuitively one might think that
increased domestic drilling would
result in immediately cheaper gas,
but it’s the type of policy that will
handcuff the United States to
outdated technology.

Fossil fuels are on their way
out, and there is no need to rely
on them anymore. Continuing to
tie the nation to a ﬁnite resource

is dangerous and irresponsible, .

especially given bleak reports on
peak oil.

Instead, the United States
should position to become the
leader in alternative fuels and
establish an industry so that it
would not need to rely on hostile
nations for its energy.

End the millions in subsidies
given to farmers growing corn for
ethanol, an alternative fuel source
that has proven to be inefficient
and unable to effectively replace
oil, and transfer that money into

the construction of dams, wind
turbines, nuclear power plants,
geo-thermal energy facilities, so-
lar power ﬁelds and other alterna-
tive energy solutions.

Establish a program similar 4

to the Works Progress Adminis-
tration for the 21st century. The
next president should request that
Congress establish a program to
federally fund the construction
of these new technologies. Not
only would this spur investment,
economic growth and create bad-
ly needed jobs, but it would ac-
celerate the transition away from
fossil fuels. Establish the energy
sector as the largest sector in the
United States, and provide jobs
and career opportunities for mil-
lions of people.

W'hile this new energy sec-
tor would take time to establish,
Congress should create programs
to beneﬁt consumers immedi-
ately. More federal money should
be spent on helping the doinestic
auto industry develop affordable
hybrids and fund buy—bacl< pro-
grams that would pay a premium

Solutions to all the World's energy problems

for traditional internal combus—_
tion engines. ii

The United States is at a crisis
point with gas prices at some of

p their highest levels and foreclo-

sures still occurring at a record

pace. Congress and the president

cannot feud over how to move“
forward but must act now and
transcend silly partisan politics in
the face of a potential collapse of
the U.S. economy. The American
people deserve a comprehensive,
viable solution to a problem that
touches on every aspect of soci-
ety.

To allow political differences
to get in the way of what needs
to be a major effort on behalf of,_.,
the federal government is irre-
sponsible and unforgivable. De-
mand that the next president ap-
proach the economic and energy
predicament not as two separate
problems but as one crisis that
needs broad all—inclusive solu-

V‘ By William Shakespeare
Directed by‘Kar|a Boos .

‘ July 31 to Aug. 24, 2008
Outdoors in Mellon Park

When most people think Shakespeare, they
think of “Romeo and Juliet,” "The Merchant
of Venice” or “Macbe .” They dont think of
“Cymbeline,” a Shakespearean play alternately
classiﬁed as a tragedy, romance or comedy
 loosely based on the life of a ﬁrst—centuty British
 king. ‘
But Karla Boos isn’t most people; ,
Boos, director of Quantum T'heatre’s produc-
 tion of “Cymbe'line,” has wanted to produce the
2} play for a long time, and after  “Richard
H” in 2004, she decided that “Cymbeline’ ’ would
be the next work of Shakespeare she directed

‘-Tveloved ‘Cymbeline’ for a long time,” said
Boos.

But when asked why she decided to do
“Cyri‘tbeline” now, Boos was vague except for
the fact that it had nothing to do with anything
going on in the world today.

“My decisions to do  are personal,” said
Boos , i ‘

Although the decision to direct “Cymbe—
line” was a personal one, it will be performed in
the very public Venue of Mellon Park. The fact

. that this is Pittsburgh’s 250th anniversary was an

important factor in deciding to hold the perfor-
mance in Mellon Park, Boos said. _ _

She also emphasized that it’s important to
perform the play in a natural setting because
“[‘Cymbeline’s’] -about journeys through the nat-
uralworl .”

The play might be about such natural jour-
neys, but that didn’t stop Boos from working

with The Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon ,
g to incorporate technology into a play based on

ﬁrst—century Britain.

“[The’Robotics Institute] wanted to provide
some technology that would allow artists to go to
a different place,” said Boos She wouldn’t elabo-
rate except to say that the technology is used in
such a way as to control the audience

But incorporating modern technology into a
ﬁrst—century tale isn’t the only way Boos puts her
own twist on the performance of “Cymbeline”

‘heavy metal fronttnan

by Justin Jacobs
/1 0° E Editor

Though heavy metal is often one of the
most ignored genres in music, there’s no deny-
ing that the few bands that poke through to the
mainstream get there for a reason.

In Disrurbed’s case, that reason is consisten-
CY-

The band has consistently released album af-
ter album of hard—hitting, heavily percussive and
melodic heavy metal that’ll get you going at the
gym or on your way to class, not to mention as a
great alarm clock in the morning A

Though the band’s music isn’t the most com-
plex or inventive, Disturbed’s fans don’t seem to
care —— the band is one among only seven bands
to have three consecutive albums top the charts.
And considering that those other bands include
Metallica, U2 and Pearl jam, it’s clear that Dis-
turbed is here to stay.

I sat down with Disturbed’s frontman David
Drairnan at the Rockstar Mayhem  on
Aug 2 to talk about the state of the music scene,
the band’s new album and how religion can play
a roll, even in heavy metal.

.‘ u

first week sales from the last record is bucking
that trend. It deﬁnitely is  in a way. It puts

Ethical quanda-
ties are real pains.
On one hand,
, Disturbed’s Imme-
 _. like is probably the
 strongest album re-
leased by the band
' in recent memory.

 

 the otherhand, it ‘sounds like the same
i old Disturbed that many know and love, not

opening itself to irmovation and attracting

-  ewfans. _ V
-  I’m so conﬂicted.

 Disturbed’s strongest point is its music.

 i‘l"ve ever heard, courtesy of Dan Donegan.
ii David Draiman’s vocals are the same as they

ever were — booming and rhythmic —. which
works well with the band’s musical style. Plus,

i [with the album totaling almost 50 minutes,

you get your money’s worth. I
And the lyrics are as angry as ever, lead-
ing one to ponder why the band doesn’t just

L .call itself Angsty McAr1gst—Angst. Just check
-, it out: “Branded like an animal / I can still feel -

them  Burning my mind / I. do believe that

. D. you made your message clear / I think I am
? ii losingmymin .”

Both elements combine to make quite

‘ a fun, albeit angry album. This is definitely

something to blow out your car’s subwoofer.
As for its weak points, Disturbed falls vic-

if: tirn to its own hype. Donegan said the album
. , would be “ballsier’ ’ than previous installments,
-'3 and Draiman said it would have a darker, more 

evil tone. Granted, it’s hard to make mad metal

 albums sound even more evil. —‘

But the album doesn’t sound ballsier. It

. B sounds almost exactly like the group’s previ-
- ous albums, down to some of the rhythms and
in musical keys employed; The lytics, as said, are

as angry as ever, and that’s about it. They don’t
deviate from their normal path, not allowing

, for much introspection of current affairs.

For another bit of nitpicking, and probably
some weirdness, these songs drag. They’re not
to the point of going more than six minutes,
but they feeklike they border on six minutes
when thegfre really four minutes long.

How this kind of audio black hole is mani-

fest is anyone’s guess, but this album might be

one to skip if you’re bored in class (unless you
lll<C spending your time in a no passing zone).

 

Back to the hype, it’s the main reason why
the letter grade has been docked ‘a few points.
Despite it, the album falls ﬂat as the band set_~
tles for staying its traditional course rather than
carving its own swath for others to imitate

The album also restricts," the audience.
Metal bands tend to be so stuck in a niche that
the stereotype of nappy-haired head bangers
reigns supreme. \W1th just the slightest tweak
to its sound, Disturbed could obliterate the
dike and carve its path of destruction for a ris-
ing empire. Instead, the band members have
settled for sticking their ﬁngers in the leaky

hole.

That’s not to say this album’s bad. It’s prob—'

ably the group’s strongest to date. But to make
all the claims about more balls and evil and
not deliver, you have to expect some sort of
punishment.

Though maybe, in retrospect, it’s probably
for the best that it didn’t innovate. Some bands
have fallen victim to‘ experimentation, and it’s

hard to imagine how a metal band could rein— i

vent its sound while still retaining the energy
and darkness of which it’s made an empire.
So, Disturbed acquired a balance. It’s a

good album with great music (especially the 

solos) that sounds the same as its previous al-
bums

, Then  I guess the credo of “if it ain’t
broke, don’t fix it” exists for a reason.

In short, Disturbed fans are sure to eat it
up. For those who have never listened to them,
give this album a try first, and then follow up
with Believe, a close second. That’s right —
I’m a Disturbed fan and proud of it What I’m
not proud of is  it a bad grade, but when
promises are broken, someone’s bound to be
hurt.

DD: The metal scene ebbs and flows like the

in the past 20 years. If we were  the
times of early JudasiPriest, no one would bat
an eyelash at  Disturbed metal. But these

days,  by the overall vibe of the bands 1 75

populating the side stages, we might not fit in if

that category. It seems the majority of fans have

Eclectic improv troupe

has hustle and flow

by Anton Skerl
Staff [Writer

After a hard day’s work of managing a deli
or a Cold Stone Creamery, consulting ﬁnancial
sales, freelancing graphic design and writing,
most would settle for relaxing with drinks and
friends. The improv actors of comedy troupe
H ustlebot would rather perform with friends
than relax ~— though maybe with the occa-
sional drink.

“We can be method actors, absurdists,
cartoonish, dark, child~like and obscene, de-
pending on the show, and sometimes all those
things in one night,” said mcmberjohn Feight—
net in an interview.

They are ltlustlebot, a local improv quin-
tet that can be seen at Modernliormations on
Penn Avenue.

Members chat with the audience before
performances —— possibly in search of mate-
rial, but definitely displaying their appreciation
for their fans.

“We kind of blazed our collective trail and
would like to think that we are just_as original
as everyone else,” said Joe \X/ichryk II, who has

Worry--free parkin

been with Hustlebot since it began as a project
for a CMU masters degree.

Two years ago, the troupe’s first director,

Ryan Kiessling, arranged a comedy night in
Downtown Pittsburgh, and soon Hustlebot
was formed.

“As part of _this show, Ryan brought his
experience into the fold by teaching open
workshops in the Chicago—style long-form
of improv,” said member David Fedor. It was
from these workshops that the core group of
Hustlebot formed.”

The group now has a home in Modern-
Formations, a small art and theater space that
celebrates diversity and originality, from the
purple walls to the pink bathtub that some-
times doubles as a cooler. \With only about 25
chairs and three worn couches along the walls,
ifs a small performance space, but that’s ﬁne
with Hustlebot.

Its brand of long-form improv could be
likened to “Memento” — bits and pieces of a
story are played out at random until the ending
finally ties them together. The style is unlike
popular improvised shows like “Whose Line
is it Anyway?” and “Reno! 911,” but it still gets

The various road hazards could be the audi-

As thousands of people rubbed the hang-

the huge campground of the All Good Music
Festival in Masontown, W Va., Bill Remington
sat alone in a chair, his back upright, seemingly

prepared for the day.

“I feel wonderful. I’m relaxed, l’m chilled.
It’s been good — it’s been all good. I’ve no
plans of when to leave. Maybe today, maybe
not,” he said. “l’ve come for four years by my-
self. I always run into people I know. We’re a
very strong community, tight—knit. We’re alike
people, no matter how old you are.”

Remington was at least 55, with a gray
beard, square face and calm, almond eyes
scanning the scene behind his sunglasses. He
grinned peacefully, knowing, it seemed, that

It was two days and two nights after I’d ar-
rived at the All Good Music Festival, a huge,
non—stop collective of experimental, impro-
visational rock and funk and electronic and
bluegrass bands from all across the country.
I’d seen and experienced so much, felt and

heard so much more, that I might as well have 3

been in an entirely different world.
And for the 20,000 people camping out in
veritable tent cities around the beautiful Mar-

vin’s Mountaintop site, that was exactly the

point. p _
The scene was surreal: The same masses,

  

everything was in its right place.

labyrinth that ‘blared from the stage, were now
subdued, walking around like me, half asleep
and half wondering, “Did that all really hap-

But Remington’s tone was calm — his low
voice and his unfaltering  brought me back
down to earth. The weekend —~ the madness

of 20,000 bodies dancing and singing  .

talking and smoking and flying higher than

. Pitt alum makes magic
 with new fantasy novel

by Colleen Counihan
Staff [Writer

Cameo Rowe’s recently self—published novel
has been through a lot. First written in short
story form as a gift, the book has since been ac-
cidentally deleted from a floppy disk, critiqued
by numerous Pitt professors and repeatedly re-
written and revised.

Rowe, who graduated from Pitt last spring,
recalls working on the book, titled “Defenders
of the Realm I: The World Mystic Arts Tourna-
ment,” for six years before recently sealing its
destiny as the first published segment of his
“Defenders of the Realm” trilogy.

‘‘I wrote a short story as a gift for a retiring
English teacher during my senior year of 
school,” said Rowe. “From there, I just kept
working on it, and it got longer and longer.”

The version Rowe remembers from his
early years of college is very different from
what readers will ﬁnd in the final draft, though.
He references the accidental deletion of his
first draft, emotional maturation and a change
in writing style to be prominent factors in the
book’s transformation over the years.

- Rowe sent out pieces of his book to friends

Hoping to use the literary half of his double
major in  and English  at Pitt
to boost the novel’s growth, Rowe looked to his
teachers for direction.

“I showed it to a number of professors,
but the feedback wasn’t great, so I had to just
write different  in class and revise ‘Realm’
on the side as my style evolved,” he said. “The
book is now cleaner, more cohesive, and it deals
with more emotional issues” '0

During the 2005-06 school year, Rowe
worked as a co-editor in chief for B1ackLine lit-
erary magazine, the official publication of Pitt’s
Black Action Society.

and classmates for feedback.

Robert Boswell, R0we’s classmate, worked
on BlackLine with Rowe. Boswell has read
“Realm” and drafts for the upcoming sequel.
A self-described anti—fantasy reader, Boswell
was pessimistic about what Rowé’s book would
have to offer.

‘‘I figured it wouldn’t be that great, but I was
surprised,” he said. “I ended up really getting
into the characters.” '

" to an unrequited loveaffair with a stripper

 One lyrically creative surprise is “Here

  “I’d say this is the darkest songl ever

In short, this is a fun album. Listening to it

Modern Guilt

Beck

Released: July 8
lnterscope Records
Rocks Like: Beck

 

Beck
has done it
again with

Ma:/em Cm"//,
teaming up
with Danger
Mouse and

 

Cat Power tocreate a sound that
is all about creative expression
and tunes that hit the right note
every time. The sound is unmis-
takably Beck, and fans would ex-
pect nothing less from this music
industry institution.

Mot/er/1 Gail! is a bit off at
first glance. These songs should
not go together. There is little
that binds them in the traditional
sense, little that combines them
into one cohesive piece of an art-

ist’s music with a single stylistic
theme capturing the feelings of
the artist at the time. Still, there
is no doubt that each song em-
bodies Beck’s distinct style. The
essence of it pervades every track
to its core, binding the stylistic ri-
vals together and creating 21 won-
derfully grotesque monster of
off-kilter music that ﬁnds a home
anywhere it can. .

Every song is worthy of a sec-
ond listen, a lean in, a fully appre-
ciative, closed—eyed absorption
of every element comprising the
music, lyrics and tone.

Beck exceeds expectations
by meeting needs listeners never
knew they had until they heard
the ﬁnal product. This album
works. The perceived incongru-
ity of style, whether deliberate or
unintentional, will do no less than
blow your mind.

“Gamma Ray” succeeds in
this area, being equal parts ’60s-
era musical tribute and modern,
environmental awareness song.

While the video clearly cap-
tures the artistic movement of the
’60s, complete with kaleidoscope

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

faces and a fusion of fashion and
art, the music speaks for itself.
The keys alone conjure up these
characteristic images without the
blatant illustration. The phrase

~ “icecaps melting down” brings to

mind the threat of global warm-
ing in a subtle, lyrical reminder. If
nothing else, “Gamma Ray?’ has a
bass line that knocks you over the
head and an effortlessly cool cho-
rus that will send the song to the
top; of your playlist every time.
The instrumentals of
“Chemtrails” visit another, more
recent era, with its hard—edged
rock style reminiscent of the ’90s
alt-rock scene. The far-off, wispy
and echoing vocals blend seam-

lessly with the crashing percus-A

sion and electric guitar, proving
that opposite decibels attract.
The melancholy lyrics are a bit

' disturbing, especially with the re-

petitive images of drowning, as
in: “But all I can see in this night
is boats sinking / Down by the
sea swallowed by evil / We’ve al-
ready drowned.”

The music and lyrics are no
less moving because they are not

about happy times with friends
and fluffy woodland creatures. It
is better to use words to paint a
picture that stretches the mind to
a strange place rather than to con-
tinually revisit the same themes.
“Volcano” is the perfect end
to a perfect album, with pacing
that allows listeners to hear every
last meaningful word. It is difﬁ-

' cult to distract oneself from the

_lyrics long enough to appreciate
the music. There is no lack of tal-
ent here. Few musicians areso in
tune and introspective that they
can capture the exact emotions
of an event and translate them
into a song that leaves nothing to
be desired. There is just an unde-
niable feeling that this is right.
Can anyone else compare to
this? After all, who sounds lik

Not a guilty pleasure: Beck outdoes himselfiis  

shades of the artist are reﬂected
in each track. A different mood, a
different sentiment, but the same
poetic, intelligent, avant-garde
music is present at every turn.
The key to long-term survival
is holding onto oneself and de-
ﬁning one’s own boundaries and
conventions. Music cannot get

lost in the scuffle of changifig .

times if it never really belonged
there to begin with. Such is the '
music of Beck. It is [always a class
apart, never quite matching 
status quo of popular music but
ﬁnding a home there anyway.

Modern Guilt" is the perfect T

harmony of the artist’s self and

the outside world. It is the perfect

expression of unadulterated cre-
ative energy. There are no simple
rhymes to be found, if not "get
to music, each song could statid
alone as a notable piece of writ-
ing. The imagery is often  ;
but it no less poignant. It is the

for three too many measures. Though ari-
noying at first, the song has a fun message,

. and it grows on you. It’s one of those songs I
. that you try not to like, but youvﬁnd yourself

dancing along.

The rest of the album is surprisingly sub-

by‘ the group’s hit “Stay.” But the emotions
of “Stay” are one of a kindbecause of its
unique topic: an affair from the View of the

strikingly predictable. _ “Joey,” “Genevieve,”
“Keep You” and “What I’d Give” are all
about lost love. Nettles’ vocals work well with
these songs, but there is nothing else about
these songs that stands out. The instrumen-
tals are not very notable —— they mainly serve
to accompany Nettles’ voice.

The only one of these songs with poten-

tial is “joey,” which is at “what if” song that.

describes what is going through a woman’s
mind whenher boyfriend dies while driving

drunk. The song deﬁnitely makes the listener-
think.

Jennifer .

“What if I spoke up / What if I took the

keys,” she  “What if we never fell in

love ... would I know this hurt?”

On the other end of the emotional spec-
trum, Nettles and Bush wrote “Steve Earle,”
which is a tiibute of sorts to the country
rocker and political activist Some consider
Earle .a savior of country music in the ’80s.
Sugarland’s song is about his womanizing -
Earle had seven wives, and the song’s narra-
tor wishes to be one. s

“Well, I heard Steve Earle had lots of
wives / About as many‘ as cats have lives,”
Nettles sings. S

The narrator then goes on to describe how
Earle wrote a song about all of his women
and wrote “an even better one” when they
broke up.

“Steve Earle, Steve Earle, ‘please write a
song for me,” she sings.

The one song that stands out from the
mediocre pack is “We Run,” which is about
 that special someone who can help
you do  you never thought you could,
even if you know it’s not completely right.

“Old enough and should know better /
But doing what you shouldn’t is half the fun
/ So "we run,” Nettles sings. “You may never

know how fast you can go / ’Til someone
lifts your feet up off the ground.”

The only thing that could possibly save
this album is its musicianship, but even that
is,  The instrumentals are primarily
simple acoustic arrangements with the steel
guitar sneaking in every now and then. This

works with songs that have good vocals and A
a moving message — like “Stay” — but none i

of these songs combine everything together

as some of Sugarland’s previous hits.
Nettles and Bush must have set the bar

too high with their first two albums, because

~ Winning stories short and sweet

1’!/_ '

«C»

by Anton Skerl
Staff [Writer

"Out Loud"

Anthony Varallo
University of Pittsburgh Press
Release date: Sept. 98

Anthony Varallo’s “Out Loud,” winner
of Pitt’s Druc I-leinz Literature Prize, is an
example of the profound potential of the
written word —— a power that can educate,
sway opinions and still be fun to read.

The book is a collection of short stories
told from varying points of views, such as an
embarrassed middle school child and a de-
pressed divorcee starting a journal. They all
have a unifying theme, however: The charac-
ters tend to second-guess themselves and are
typically silent compared to their often—chatty
companions.

The stories themselves are not in any
form a manifestation of the fantastic — in
fact, the closest the book comes to unrealistic
is the mere mention that a hole in a garden
might lead to Narnia. Each character is a very
down-to-earth person with real fears, depres-

_, sions, concerns and epiphanies. Despite the

"\lHlU(ll l

 archetype of ordinary people in
an ordinary world, they don’t feel like stock
characters. They are driven, as Varallo has
said, “by a love of ordinary life.”

And it shows. Menial tasks such as ba-
by-sitting and mowing the lawn are given
newfound signiﬁcance as Varallo seamlessly
transitions from the activity itself to the scat-
ter—brained thought processes that surely grip
any person teetering on the jagged precipice
of self—inﬂicted boredom.

Varallo puts to words with eerie accu-
racy some of the most mundane thought
processes that many wouldn’t give a second
notice. This is perhaps epitomized in the sec-
ond story, “The Walkers.” It revolves around
a couple that, instead of learning their
neighbors’ names, gives them nicknames
and fabricated back-stories. They then have
impromptu, imagined conversations with
them, down to the most nuanced awkward
silence or inappropriate question. There’s no
real dialogue until the end, where the story
comes full circle in an ironic and rather clever
point. .

\While the stories don’t average more than
15 pages apiece, the characters are still well-

rounded. It’s amazing that with such little '

space Varallo has crafted real people, not just

actors who must react to every whim of their

creator. Every little bit of history is divulged
— even how one poor soul is blackmailed to
silence, lest his tearful encounter with “ET”
be known to the cruel school—going public.

However, some of the stories fall short
because of that reason. They’re not very
long, making for quick reads of about 20
minutes. Because of that, some of the stories
don’t seem to have a proper conclusion. Oth-
er times, some of the metaphors employed
are strange, even borderline ridiculous. How
does one feel, exactly, when “casually handed
a refrigerator?”

Some of the awkwardness can seem out
of place or’ just strange, such as a teacher re-
lating his personal life to one of his middle
school students.

The student doesn’t say much, while the
teacher fills in the gaps of silence with per-

sonal stoiies on the cruelty of kids, dating

and love (going so far as to divulge that his
first kiss was at 22 years of age). It feels like

i an unnecessarily-forced drama.

Nonetheless, this book is the work of
a borderline literary genius who ' certainly
showed why he deserved the award.

It’s an eyeglass to the every day, a micro-
scope to the mundane, an observatory to the
ordinary and an all—around good read to curl

create racial diversity in a literary genre that is
rarely associated with non-white characters.

“In particular with this book, you don’t
think of African American people, but this
book had an almost all-black cast,” said Bo-
swell.

Rowe doesn’t seem to be worried about
breaking political _or social ground, though. His
current barrier is getting his book out into the
public eye.

‘Since “Realm” is first and foremost a fanta-
sy novel, Rowe originally made the decision not
to delve too deeply into complicated subjects.

But he found that his many rewrites and his

own maturing lifestyle gave rise to a more com-
plex storyline, bringing emotional factors to the
foreﬁront along with action and imagery. .

“There is a love story in it, and you have ‘
several characters dealing with the loss of a i
loved one,” said Rowe. “You have people be— '

coming victim to an increase in technology and
a growing society.”

“Defenders of the Realm I,” though brand— 
ed by a long title, follows a fairly basic plotline t

that is reminiscent of other well—known sci-

  Rowe writes
 a book of the

Fantasy alum, page 14 6

 ence fiction and fantasy novels.

“When I was young, I read ‘Lord of the-
Rings’ and ‘Harry Potter’ and watched ‘Star

 Wars,’ so I had a good basis of how  '

should go,” said Rowe.
He believes these science fiction forefathers

 are only inﬂuences, not sources of replica-
~ tion. The characters, situations and emotions

of ‘-‘Realm” are originalgand  not

9 ‘lord of the Rings” rehashes.

“Realm”introduces readers to the story of
young mystics coming of age in the world of
Gaea. The main character is Aleron, a boy who

I‘ was separated from his family at an  age

and raised in the wilderness.

These students could be comparable to se-
niors in  school, but instead of graduating,
their powers are put to test in a “world mystic-
arts tournament.” The  of these mystics
symbolizes the  of a battleibetween
good and evil, between opposing forces known

I asthe“Kindr ”andthe_“Occult.” . _

“‘I had the basic outline of the trilogy in my

head,” said Rowe. ‘The most important  is I

having the characters get to the tournament at

the end of the first book, and then, as the other ‘

books unfold, it’s how has the world changed
and what kind of challenges will the characters
have to face.” . '

. Rowe saiid' that his personal work ethic

played a large role in  out pages during

the long  process.

‘Tm the kind of person that gets really into
things,” he said. “I have the kind of mentality
where I keep working and working if some-
thing needs done.” , V ‘

Along with self—motivation, Rowe said
he relied on certain kinds of music to set the

mood for his creativity and keep him focused. 2 , y , , .
We’relocated at 3412 Forbes Ave., Public safety a
Building, and we have two mini—stations on campus, st...

e 3800 block of Forbes Ave, Pa

Depending on the scene he was working on,
Rowe would choose from classical music and

 a other low—key tunes, always  to stray from

anything that would tempt him to sing along.

Whﬂe the novel has been done, for more
than a year now —— Rowe finished the most up-
dated versioniat the end of last summer —- he is
pushing for a release in online book vendors on
Nov. 15. As for real, live bookstores, a release
date is still up in‘ the air.

But the most difficult barricade for Rowe to
overcome in selling his book is ﬁnding his niche
among’sci—ﬁ readers.

“I just want to get out there and find people
who love fantasy. I can’t pretend everyone is go-
ing to want to read this book,” said Rowe: “I’m
gonna have to hit the streets.”

Fellini would talk about,” said Molinari be-
fore launching into allegories to acclaimed
Italian art film director Federico Fellini.

E7" Molinari’s brother and keeper of the
French horn, Robert Perlick Molinari, sat
next to him wearing large headphones_and
attempting to work out backtrack issues.
The computer ﬁle they were using didn’t
sound right, and both brothers were eager
to resolve the issue in an attempt to make
call time in the South Side W/orks. Still, he
had time to break away from his work for a
moment. “I don’t know what you’re talking
about,” said Robert Molinari in response to

/another explanation by David Molinari.

“ Two hours later, after the band before
them finished on the adjacent stage, FHR
prepared to tear into their set. The schedule
was running early, since bands preferred to
finish ahead of time rather than risk getting
the sound system cut off at the 25-minute
mark. ‘

Waiting with the Molinari brothers on-
stage were Paul Hammer on drums and
Deidre Muro on backing vocals. Ready to
rock, David and Robert Molinari bent over
their laptop computer screens and com-
menccd the show.

The speakers stumbled over the opening
seconds of the first backtrack. The Moli-
naris looked back and forth between their
screens and the sound booth. The crowd of

But after a few alterations and the sound

MGMT, a start-up band with ‘similar
synth sound and comparable exuberance
pervading each song, had it’s backtracks
produced by FHR as well. However, in a
performance attended ‘by David Molinari
in New Tork City last year, MGMT decided

August 19, 2008

to play the backtracks off of an iPod, with 
the only other stage fixtures being the band 

members and microphones. “They got a lot 
of shit for that,” said David Molinari. “Their 

approach to everything really inspired, espe-

cially Robert, to dive into what exactly you. i

do like.” .

The New American Music Union festival
gave FHR an opportunity to present that in-
spirational music to a new festival audience.
Though the band didn’t walk away with the
grand prize, it was still a crucial step in get-
ting more notice. l .

‘Tm just glad we’»'re on the back of a T-

said Robert Molinati.  ‘

After the performances, FHR headed to

audience members left after discovering his
voice isn’t the same as tracks off of “High-
way 61 Revisited" .” _ . V‘

Yet even as the tectonic plates of specta-
torship cracked open to allow the Molinati
brothers and their manager, Dan Harpaz,
closer to the stage, they simply stood as if

_ transﬁxed by the chronicle of time before

But the rapid tumaround didn’t start right away:

Pitt lost ﬁve of its ﬁrst games under its new coach

but the crowds remained thin. But for Berenato, the A

“That ﬁrstyearwas all about how you go about

Pitt to double-up against ,
W VHU, UConn, Nlarquette

by Zack Chakan
Aiwiata/It ‘Sparta Editor

Home games against West Virginia, Notre
Dame, Connecticut and Marquette highlight
the Pitt basketballiteam’s 2008-09 Big East
schedule. A

Although no dates have beenannounced
up to this point, the Panthers learned last
month which of their conference rivals will
travel to the Petersen Events Center in the
upcoming season.

Last year the Big East implemented a 8

scheduling change that upped each team’s

conference slate to 18 games. This allowed ‘

each team to play every school in the mas-

. sive conference at least once and three teams

twice. ’ _

West Virginia, Connecticut and DeP—
aul will battle Pitt both on the road and at
home. 4

Many factors are considered when deter-

, mining repeat opponents within the,confer-

ence. According to'bigeast.org, geography,

rivalries, television -and national interest are ‘

among the most important. " _
Those four certainly came into account
with the choice of West Virginia. The Moun-

taineers also squared off against the Panthers g’

twice last season, with the teams splitting the
contests. Last season, Pitt also faced Cincin-
nati and Villanova twice.

Most fans probably remember the ‘thrill-
ing 55-54 Pitt victory over West Virginia on
Feb. 7, when Pitt guard Ronald Ramon nailed
a 3-pointer at the buzzer to win the game.

The Panthers will face Connecticut twice A

in. the regular season —— sornething that
hasn’t happened often in the past. Led by
coach Calhoun, the Connecticut Huskies

have championship aspirations for next sea— _

son and could be a top-10 program.

Pitt may be that Notre Dame
and Marquette are venturing to Pittsburgh.‘
The Panthers lost by a combined 30 points
to the duo away from home last. year.

Cincinnati, St. John’s,_ South Florida and
Syracuse round out'Pitt’s home games.

The away schedule won’t do any favors
for the Panthers, either. Big East powerhous-
es Georgetown, Louisville and Villanova
headline Pitt’s road opponents. A 1

Along with the three home-and—home

series, Pitt will play Providence, Rutgers and ‘

Seton Hall away from the Petersen Events
Center.

Still,.Pitt enters 2008-09 with high expec-
tations because of three returning starters:
point guard Levance Fields, center Dejuan
Blair and forward Sam Young. A

That number could grow to four if Mike,

Cook is granted a sixth year of eligibility after
missing almost all of last season with a knee

0 injury suffered against Duke on Dec. 20., V
The Panthers are ranked as a preseason

top-10 pick on several Web sites, and there
could be as many as eight Big East teams
with a legitimate chance to make the field of
65 at the end of the season, many of which
could crack the 'top—25.

If point guard A. Price returns from a

' severe  he suffered in the Huskies’ final I E
gameiof the year in the'NCAA tournament,

Connecticut could join the Panthers in the
top 10. _ '

Notre Dame is receiving early accolades
as a possible top—10 program as well. With
returning Big East Player of the ‘Year Luke
Harangody and sweet—shooting Kyle McA-
larney, the Fighting Irish could have their
best season in years. '

Louisville, Marquette, Villanova and West

Virginia. are all favorites to enter the year in E.

the national rankings, with Georgetown and

' Syracuse lurking-not far behind.

In espn.com’s,Andy Katz’s most recent
preseason rankings, he slots the Panthers
as the No. 2 team in the country. K-atz gives
similar praise to the other Big East schools.
He rates Notre Dame at No. 4, Louisville at

. No. -5, Marquette at No. 14, Connecticut. at :9‘

No. 15, Villanova at No. 18 and West Vir-
ginia at No. 20. 8

Pitt’s nonconference schedule and dates it
‘should not be released until September, but

some other programs have announced their 

opponents and have the Panthers on their
slates. _ i
Vermont visits the Pete Dec. 6 for the
first time in three seasons. Pitt knocked off
the Catamounts, 63-52, on Dec.,17, 2005.
The Oakland Zoo willialso catch NCAA

its next game. _
Siena  Pitt will battle Dec. 18..

The only nonconferenceroad game for 

Pitt that has been announced thus far is a
contest‘ against Florida State of the ACC.
That game is scheduled for Dec. 21. '

The Panthers are also playing two neutral 
site games in Newark, N.]., for the Legends 
Classic. These games will take place Nov. 
28-29. Their opponents have not been de—

More than anything else, this summer showed

This summer he showed the skill set of a Pitt—style
basketball player \While he is a bit undersized for
a forward (6-5, 210 pounds), he’s a coach’s player
and his motor doesn’t stop He’s aggressive on
both sides of the court, and he knows how to
play the game Travon \X/oodall was impressive as
well Woodaﬂ is  quick and showed good
decision—making. He could challenge for minutes
as Fields’ primary  at point guard.

Dwight l\/ﬁller (6-8, 220) is raw but he’s also
intense. Miller’s offensive game needs_some polish-
ing, buthewas amaniac on theglass this summer.
Freshman Ashton Gibb‘s‘was, perhaps, the biggest
surprise this summer Gibbs showed the best range
of all of Pitt’s prospective guards It’s highly unlikely
Gibbs will get the opportunity to start, but he will
be a productive player for coach Dixon sooner
rather than later

Golﬁng with Giles

..Golf with

by Giles Howard‘
Contri/mtirrq E3it0/I‘

About a week or two ago I had
a ‘tee time with a friend to play
a nice course about 40 minutes
north of Pittsburgh.

It was going to be a nice break
from work and a good chance to
get away from the courses we nor-
mally play. V I

Then Pittsburgh weather in-
tervened. The forecast for that
dayiwas terrible. The radar looked

‘geven worse, and we decided we
didn’t want to drive 40 minutes
just to seeour tee time rained out.

But we really wanted to play
golf.

The solution: “Why not play
South Park,” my friend said. “Well,
why not,” I said.

The round we played at South
Park, entirely without rain by the
way, constituted a four-and—a—
half—hour answer to my rhetorical

"Question.

times; as W mill l$
M & ﬁEFEhEl§l3E W Flﬂl

(3!

 

 

I should start by explaining that
there are three things (and three
things only) that would make me
recommend South Park. It’s cheap
(about $15), it’s close, and it has
a good distribution of par threes
and par ﬁves.

But aside from these three
things, my last experience at South
Park was unpleasant. The tee box-
es weren’t well maintained, the
pin placement was simply mean-
spirited, and the starter was inef-
fectual.

But by far the worst part of my
experience at South Park was not
the fault of the course bgt instead
my own mistake: I decided to walk
the course.

Having spent the last few years
walking golf courses, I like to
think that I’ve developed a cer-
tain level of endurance. But lately
I’ve almost exclusively taken a cart
when playing 18 holes. I didn’t
even think of using a cart at South
Park because, after all, I never
used one there in years past.

 

IE an YEAR

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

I’m not even sure why walking
the course was so miserable that
day. It wasn’t too hot or muggy or
even too sunny, but I simply didn’t
have as much fun

And fun is really all that’s im-
portant when you play bogey or

’ double bogey golf the way I do.

So this is my new resolution: I
will always walk when playing nine
holes or fewer. But from now on,
I will take a cart when I play 18
holes.

This new policy has two draw— I

backs as far as I can tell.

First, -taking a cart is more ex-
pensive than simply  But
when you’re playing courses with
$30, $40 or $50 greens fees to be-
gin with, an extra $10 isn’t that big
of a deal. _ A I - '

Second, you experience the

course in greater depth when you
walk it than when you spend the

. day in a cart. - .

Still, I think-this is for the best.
I like to relax when I play golf, and

‘there is nothing relaxing about

DIANE TRESSA_
I . BAILBONDS

m:'r our
  0F JAIL  

no cart? N 0 thanks

walking ﬁverniles with a bag of
metal rods on one’s back.

But as far as this impacts the
game itself, I feel as though this
new principle will help my overall
score.

Think about it: If -you’re not
exerting yourself by walking the
course butinstead riding in a cart,
then you have more energy — en-

ergy that can instead be directed '

toward executing and maintaining
a proper swing. ' _

At least this is [how I’m justify-
ing what others might call laziness
on my part. I

There is, of course, one excep-
tion for this new rule: the golf

course at Schenley Park. As many
of you know, Schenley doesn’ti
~ have any golf carts on the course.

-But I’ll continue to play Schen-

ley, cart or not, because it’s too

cheap and convenienta course to
ignore. - _ . ' e V 0
After‘ all, at as for 18 holes I
can pretty much walk or limp off
at any point if I’m tired.

Pitt baseball team end

9:4,

by Adam Littman
Senior Staff Wrtter

It was the only ﬁtting way for

the Pitt baseball team to endiitsl
.1-season: two games decided by one I

and two runs, respectively, both
resulting in losses.

The doubleheader sweep
against Connecticut, combined
with a defeat the day before to
the Huskies, ended the Panthers’
season on a three-game losing
streak.

Streakiness was not a friend to
Pitt this past year.

.On three different occasions,
Qhe Panthers lost three games in
row.
Twice they had losing streaks
of four games, and one stretch
saw ﬁve consecutive losses.
Conversely, the Panthers’ lon-
gest winning streak this year was
two games, which was accom-
plished on ﬁve separate occa-
sions. '

’ But it wasn’t just the losing
streak to end the season_that was a

. J

.v

 

microcosm of the entire season.
The Panthers (19-34, 7-19 Big

East) had 19 games decided by

two runs or fewer. Pitt went 6-13

in those games, including six loss- '

es in 10 one-run games.

One major reason the Panthers
were able to keep many games
close was because of improved
play as the game entered its later
stages." '

In the ﬁrst six innings, op-
ponents outscored Pitt, 272-261.

5 But during innings 7-9, the Pan-

thers held a 98-69'runs—scored ad-
vantage over opponents.

While close losses and almost-
comebacks resulted in ' tough
defeats this past year, the experi-
ence in those close contests could
prove pivotal next season for the
Panthers, who constantly ﬁelded a
young team this year.

One of the Panthers’. top of-
fensive threats from a year ago,
University of Kentucky-transfer
Gary Bucuren, played in only two
games this year. '

In his first season at Pitt last "

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

year, Bucuren ledighe team with a
.319 batting average and tied for
second in home runs with ﬁve.

With his injury came an open- '

ing at third base, and in stepped
Joe Leonard.

The freshman, much like

Bucuren, ﬁnished the year with

the team’s highest batting aver-
age (.335) and tied for second in
home runs (7). .

“[He] had an exceptional year
as a true freshman,” said Jordano.
“In my opinion he was ﬂat-out
the freshman of the year in the

conference but also was one of ‘

the best players in the league.”

On the mound, the Panthers '

lost Ryan Dunford to injury.

Last season as a sophomore,
Dunford pitched ‘in 11 games,
compiling an ERA of 1.91.

Before the year even started,
the Panthers lost two of their top
pitchers from last year, Paul Nar-
dozzi and Kyle Landis, who were
both selected in last year’s Major
League Baseball draft. V

Freshman relief pitcher David

s season in slump

Kaye and starter Corey Baker ap-

. peared in’ alcombined 39 games;

Kaye’s ERA of 2.52 and Bak-

er’s of 5.15 were the two best ‘

on the team of any pitcher who

pitched more than 33 innings.
Sophomore Nate Reed led the

team with ﬁve wins, three com-

plete games and 70 strikeouts. .

Also seeing time on the mound
this year for Pitt were freshmen
Cole Taylor, Kevin Dooley and

. Hugh Henry. ~ .
“All of those guys should b .

prepared for even better numbers
next~se'ason because, of the ex-
perience they received this year,”
said Jordano. _, 9

While Pitt loses seniors Sean

- Conley, Nick ,Mullins and Dan
. Williams, it should return Danny

Lopez, who ﬁnished second on

the team in average (.319) and ‘

home runs  and ﬁrst on the
team in steals (21). 1
—Startersi]ordan_ Herr and Mor-
gan Kielty should also be back
next year, as well as John Schultz,
Chris Tonte and Zach Duggan. ,

N 0 safety zone: Fields vs. DeCicco

by Zack Chakan
Atatzlttant Sparta Editor

Dom DeCicco and Elijah Fields appear to be

I. ‘ quite similar football players

‘Their listed weights age 220 pounds apiece
DeCicco is 6 feet 3 inches — one inch taller than

 ‘ Fields Both are local products: DeCicco went to
I  Thomas Jefferson  School, while Fields is a

—: Duquesne High giad.

 Strong safeties  for the starting position in-

And most importantly, both are sophomore

 ' Pitt’s opener against Bowling Green Aug. 30.

DeCicco and Fields are considered by many

 as two of the most athletic kids in the program.

 Coaches have lauded both for outstanding
\

 springs

So who has the edge?
Both have similar ideas about it.
“We know the situation,” said DeCicco of the

 battle for the starting  ‘

“We’re both going to play no matter what

“ it We’re both going to come out here and compete
A to  each other better players, and- it’ll beneﬁt

I ' the whole team.”

Fields agreed >
‘‘It’s a nice, friendly competition,” he said

“Dom is my best friend. Both of us are  .

to play regardless It doesn’t matter who starts” a
Secondary coach Jeff Hafley echoes his safe-

'- ties’ assessments.

“If both do a great job and bothkeep work-

.__  ing hard and doing the right things like they’Ve
 done, they/ll both ﬁnd _a spot on the ﬁeld,” said

it. Haﬂey. .
 “If they deserve to play, we’re  to play
 lIl'lCI'Il.”

 

Q

t


 

Regardless of who comes out of camp vic-
torious, the Panthers will be pleased with the duo,
who each had very different seasons in 2007.
DeCicco might have the slightest of advan-
tages because of recent football exposure
The true sophomore from Jefferson Hills

playedin 10 games as a freshmanlastyear, with

most of those appearances coming on special
teams Hemadesixtackles and earnedaletter.

But DeCicco forced coaches to notice him
with a fantastic all-around  '

“He did ‘a nice job of learning the defense
and really improving from the first practice to the
last,” said Haﬂey.

“He took some great strides, not only in his

 physical ability on die ﬁeld, but really his mental
. ﬁbi1ity,aswell. It’s  see.”

DeCicco said he learned a lot from the veter-

‘ ans in the secondary during the spring,

“You’ve got to come out ready to practice ev-
ery day,’ ’ said DeCicco.

“There can’t be a day where you have your
mind on something else. You have to have your
mind ongettingbettereveryday.”

While DeCicco had an early start and saw

Playing time right away, Fields’ journey was a bit

tougher .
Fields had to withstand tough obstacles even

- to create a competition for the fall.

A redshirt sophomore, Fields appeared in
eight games during the 2006 season, mostly in
special teams situations

His stunning raw athleticism impressed the
Pitt coaching staff eliciting hopes. that he would
be a productive player in the Pitt secondary the
next year: ‘

iBut head coach "Dave W/annstedt suspended

Fields tot all of the 2007 season tot violating‘

team rules, delaying his impact and progression
another year.

After a full year off the football ﬁeld, Fields
is  to make his presence known on and off
the ﬁeld.

‘Tm real excited just to get back on the Field,”
said Fields “I haven’t played. I think this is the year
I can come out and show the people who I arn

“ljusthacltoleatzntodo therightthing,to

lean”

DeCicco and Fields won’t need to  solely
on their athleticism when battling for the starting
job. They have help from Halley, who’s entering

. his first season as secondary coach after 

two years as a defensive assistant
The strong safeties also can\simply look a few
yards away to senior free safety Eric Thatcher for
guidance.

, Although it was a disappointing football
:season for Pitt last year, the Panthers did
manage to produce some NFL talent.
Offensive linemen Jeff Otah and Mike
 McGlynn, along with cornerback Kennard

all have signed with their respective teams.
Otah was the only Panther taken on the
first day of the draft,’going. 19th overall- to,
ﬁttingly enough, the Carolina Panthers.
 He signed a contract for ﬁve years and
 $14 million with about $8.7 million of that
' V. guaranteed. ' T M _
 After transferring from junior college at
 Valley Forge Military Academy, Otah started
 all 24 games of his Pitt career and was an
"N All—Big East first-team selection last year. He
was also invited to play in the Senior Bowl at

 talent in the nation.
 Otah is expected to start at right tackle
 this year for Carolina. I ~

‘Although Otah won’t have to change the
name on the front of his jersey once he be-
gins his NFL career, McGlynn doesn’t have
to leave thestate to play professionally.
 In the fourth round with the 109th pick
 overall, McGlynn was drafted by the Phila-
: delphia Eagles. He signed a contract for four
3 years and an undisclosed amount.
i McGlynn was a three—time .All—Big _East
selection while at Pitt and showed a great
deal of versatility, ’ splitting time at both
guard and tackle. He also served at times as
«. the team’s long snapper during extra points
j and field goals. ‘ I I
 A Cox heads up north to Buffalo after being
' drafted in the seventh round with the 251st
overall pick. He’s also signed to a multi~year
j contract. . _
'* He started all 24 games his last two years
I with Pitt and.47 games total. Cox recorded
' 98 tackles and two interceptions. I I
i Cox has three cousins also playing in
the NFL. He joins his wide receiver Roscoe
: Parrish in Buffalo, and has also related to
_ cornerback Torrie Cox of the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers and former Pitt Panther Marcus
Hudson of the San Francisco 49ers.

Defensive end Joe Clermond and tight
end Darrell Strong weren’t selected in the
 draft, but both signed as free agents? Clet-
 mond signed with the Chicago Bears, while
. Strong signed with the Oakland Raiders.

 top performers to rebuild the farm system.

In the opposing corner, a faction of Pi-
rate diehards and media skeptics sits, criti-

productive Pirates for unproven youngsters.
Who is correct here? I

' It’s easy to sense the disdain of the latter

- group and sympathize with them. After all,

the Pirates had the best outﬁeld inbaseball '

offensively, andtwo—thirds of it was gone by

' the ﬁrstday of August. Only Nate McLouth

remains.

Bay was enjoying a fantastic comeback
from a truly disappointing 2007 campaign.
He was batting .282 with 22 home runs and
64 RBIs before the trade, numbers on par
with his career norms. A

Nady’s season was the most surprising of
all. He was ‘expected to be a key contributor
but not one of the most consistent offensive
forces in the National League.

With a .330 average (fifth in the NL), 13
home runs and 57 RBIs, Nady’s breakout
was integral to the league’s third_-best offense
(in runs) before July 25. _

Now, along with Matte, both are gone.
The main culprit? Affordable contracts‘ that
expired following the 2009 season.

But make no mistake: These trades were

not salary dumps, like some irate fans seem
to be claiming. ‘
. This isn’t the Aramis Ramirez and Kenny
Lofton to the Cubs trade of 2003, when the
two stars were dumped, for a sack of base-
balls and free coupons to a Chicago hot dog
shop. '

This was about building up Pittsburgh’s
minor league system.

Despite the Pirates’ surprising offensive
success, the club was still eight games under
.500 at the deadline. The pitching has been
absolutely putrid, performing even worse

ing rotation’s ERA is the worst in baseball. ‘

To go along with that, the Pirates’ minor-
league affiliates are among the worst of any
franchise. If you scan through a summary of

; their records, you’ll find that no squad has a

Winning record throughout all the ranks in
the system.
Worse yet, minor league scouts have only

-—.-_¢, ‘
:d‘4'fﬁ‘_‘

ly mixed. The raging battles have formulated.

than the newest "X-Files" movie. The start- .

projected a few Pirates’ prospects as having
a future major league impact, like Andrew
McCutchen, Steve Pearce and Neil Walker.

Walker has flat—out stunk in A, last
year’s ﬁrst—round choice Daniel Moskos is a
complete disaster as a starting pitcher, and
Brad Lincoln appears to be the only pitching
prospect with any hope of reaching the ma-
jors, let alone becoming a good player.

Dave Littleﬁeld left Pittsburgh’s minors
in shambles, with Huntingdon serving as the
housemaid to_ clean the mess.

The value for Bay and Nady was through
the roof because of their cheap contracts
with a year left on them. Neither is entering

free agency after the season, so their services
are not a two—month rental.

For the_Pirates to get maximum value in
return for Bay and Nady via trades, it had to
be done now. i 0

- So, did Huntingdon make the right moves

for these guys at his first trade deadline?

The Nady/Marte ‘deal to the Yankees
looks unspectacular at ﬁrst glance. All three

 

pitchers the Piratesreceived will turn 26 by.
the end of the year, hardly a restocking of I
the lower minor leagues.

Tabata, the only “high—end” prospect in
the trade, could prove to be the real jewel.
But the 19-year-old outﬁelder has shown
some maturity problems despite being on<;_.
of the Yankees’ top prospects for three years
running. He’s exactly the high—risk, high—re—
ward_player the Pirates’ system has lacked
for years.

Grading this trade may rest on Tabata’s

In your eyes, do the Pens need to make any
more moves before the season begins?

NL: Aside from a few depth acquisitions,

~ like Adam Hall last season, Pittsburgh’s roster

should be pretty much set

TH: If I were in general manager Ray She-
ro’s shoes, I’d work hard to get Staal signed for

.. .aI.1.0ther. few seasons. And, asalways, the longer ..

the contract, the better. Other than that, work on
signing the draft picks and make sure the other

prospects in the Penguinsafﬁliate programs are  :

happy and work on signing them, as well.

Early prediction time, where do the Pen-
 rank in the Eastern Conference right

now?

 \X/ith teams like the Flyers and Cana-
diens making strides, the Penguins rank in the top
three in the East However, alot is dependent on
the tearn’s secondary scoring and the develop-
ment of Staal into a consistent, all—at:ound player.

JH: I In all seriousness, I do see the Penguins
as the No. 1 team in the East Losing Hossa does
not hurt the team as many are  it out to
be, and aside from Tampa Bay, other teams in the
East did not improve as much this year.

' The West got better and the East stayed the

"same The Penguins still have the perfect blend

of ﬁrepower in the offensive department and an

effective defensive system. Along with Fleury’s

continued improvement, there is no reason why

along the way. I .
“When you have someone as good as 

you have to come out every day because he’s one I

of the most athletically  kids on the team,”
said DeCicco.

“It makes me such a better player ’cause he’s
so athletic and such a good competitor”

When told of _ DeCicco’s evaluation, Fields re-
turned the favor. , ' '

“It’s a nice honor, I’d say the same  about
him,” said Fields “We’re both the same player.”

-It’s just something else the two agree on.
