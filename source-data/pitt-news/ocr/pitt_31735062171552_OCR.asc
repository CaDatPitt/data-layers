Economy Debatetl

RS U , YAF quae   Of

by MARY ANN MARKO
Assistant News Editor

Approximately 100 people listened. applauded.
questioned. argued and hissed during a debate on
“Capitalism vs. Socialism" betweeen the Revolu-
tionary Socialist Union lRSU) and the Young Amer-
icans for Freedom (YAF) on Thursday evening.

The debate. between five-member panels. open-
ed with a 15-minute presentation from each side.

“FREEDOM VS. SLAVERY”

Maintaining that the U.S. has a “mixed economy"
rather than a free enterprise system, Dan Arico of
the YAF said. "There is no way of controlling the

economy without controling freedom. In socialism I

freedom is missing and people become domestic
animals.”

He went on to say. “Charity at the point of a gun
isn‘t charity——it‘s robbery. In the free market sys-
tem. there is no coercion. no way of gaining political
advantage.“

The first reaction from the audience came when
Arico said, “This debate should really be called
‘Freedom vs. Slavery,”’ whereupon somone in the
audience responded, “Which is which?”

Paul LeBlanc of the RSU opened his presenta-
tion with a quote from Eugene Debs. Stating that in
capitalism there are two major classes. the capi-
talists and the workers. he added. "Socialists think
of it (capitalism) as an economic dictatorship."

LeBlanc maintained that in a capitalistic sys-
tem. workers are oppressed. women are exploited
and the atmosphere is polluted. “Militarism is a
stimulus to and a pillar of a capitalistic economy."
he added.

Margaret Pexton of the RSU continued the pre-
sentation, stating, “Most people in this country
have very little control over their lives,” as a re-
sult of capitalism.

“Socialism is based on cooperation. while capi-
talism is based on competition.“ she said.
According to Pexton. “Socialism involves so-

cial ownership of industry. which is used to serve
society: rational use of production. i.e. what is pro-

-duced is what is needed; and democratic control

of industry."

POTENTIAL HORATIO ALGERS

During the panel question—answer period. in
which the audience subsequently joined. an RSU
member asked if the depression were not the result
of capitalism. Arico answered that government in-
terference. through wage controls and other meth-
ods. was the cause.

Arico claimed that it is possible for any individ-
ual to achieve success under a capitalistic economy.
citing Andrew Carnegie as an example. The RSU
countered with “Capitalism has changed since Car-
neg.ie's time." and asked how someone from the

ghetto could become another Carnegie.

The YAF’s reply was f‘By setting up his own
business,” to which the RSU queried, “Selling pret-
zels on a street corner?”

When Arico answered yes. the audience broke
into sarcastic laughter.

I THE CUBAN CASE

Jack Simmons of the YAF cited Cuba as an ex-
ample of a socialist country and read an excerpt of
an article in Dissent about the deplorable conditions
existing in Cuba.

Mark Cohen of the RSU stated that the illiteracy
rate had been greatly reduced under socialism and
that other gains had been made.

Simmons then asked, in reference to Pexton’s
claim that under socialism what is produced is what
is needed, “How are the needs of the people in Cuba
decided?”

Pexton answered that there is a Central Plan-
ning Board. but the “needs of the local community
are decided by the local community. “

LeBlanc added. "The kind of socialism we want
has not been achieved in the world to day. It is only
half-way there. in that the economy is not yet run by
the people.“

Stefan Patejak of the RSU stated, “The pur-
pose of capitalism is to produce profits, not goods.”

In response to a question from the audience.
Frank Donnatelli of the YAF defined the free enter-
prise system as “the system in which people‘ are
free to set up their own businesses. not one in which
business is free to do what it wants.“

Following the two-hour debate. informal discus-
sion groups were formed.

Throughout the debate, books, magazine arti-
cles and newspaper clipping were quoted, and books
and magazines recommended to the audience by
both sides.

Members of the panels were Mike Sauka. Barry
Wright. Donnatelli. Arico. and Simmons. YAF; and
Pat Dempsey. LeBlanc. Cohen. Patejak and Pex-
ton. RSU.

Bill Gormley was the moderator.

PSU Editor Suspended,
Calls It “Inappropriate”

by JANE HENDERSON

A 16. member faculty-student production committee of the Penn
State University newspaper. the Daily Collegian, suspended editor Bob
McHugh and reporter Rod Nordland from the paper last week.

The suspension came as the result of a story printed in the paper

about a “revolutionary" meeting of the Black Student Union (BSU)

Nordland went to the meeting as a reporter but was barred because he

is white.

Not giving up. he went to an adjoining room and overheard the BSU
discussing the use of “revolutionary tactics“ to confront and embar-
rass the new administration at Penn State. Since Norland considered it
a matter of interest to the campus population. the story was printed in

the paper's next issue.

As a result, the publishing commission suspended the two for “un-
ethical methods” used in obtaining the story.

In an interview. former editor McHugh commented. “I think the
suspension was inappropriate. The decision was the result of a personal
judgment backed up by a lot of professional opinion. The Board should
have recognized it as a personal opinion and taken that into account.
A censure would have been more appropriate than a suspension.”

According to McHugh, the meeting of the BSU had not been publi-

cized as a private one. “If it had been." he stated, “we would have rec-
ognized it as private. But the BSU admitted that had Norland been

black. they would have let him stay."

Although the managing editor, Larry Reibstein, is currently filling
McHugh’s post, he will be reinstated at the beginning of the winter
term. The suspension by the Board, he feels, was intended as a “mild

punishment.”

When asked if he feels this action will have an effect on freedom of
the press at Penn State. McHugh answered that he felt it would, but in

what manner he did not know.

"I thinkif it does set a precedent. it will be a very dangerous one.
The Commission acted only under pressure."

"Source Of Thought”

Transcendentalist Aim

David Katz. an authority on
Transcendential Meditation (Tm ).
presented an introductory lec-
ture on the topic Thursday night
at the first of two sessions. The
meditationalist spoke in 232 CL
before an enchanted audience of
more than 200.

He opened by defining the na-
ture of Transcendental Meditation
as “the process of spontaneously
going from a systematic level of
thinking to finer thinking levels.

rectly experiencing the source of

Kaufman Plugs Abortion

by KATE LOGAN

"Those of you who are in favor
of House Bill 2392 are going to
have a lot of work to do.“ declared
State Representative for the 23rd
Legislation District Gerald Kauf-
man. Kaufman. introducing House
Bill 2393. designed to liberalize
state abortion laws. spoke last
Thursday night about his bill and
its future.

Kaufman stated that being for
or against abortion is a “silly is-
sue.“ He said that he was not ad-
vocating abortion laws in regard
to morality. nor was he “sponsor-
ing murder." Instad. he stated
that his bill "was concerned with
the proper role of the state in
abortion.

Kaufman expressed concern for
the mother of an unwanted child.
saying that as society stands to-
day. there is no place for a wom-
an with an unwanted pregnancy to
turn.

. He said that “no woman should

not be passed." .

be forced to have an abortion out
of desperation.” Another purpose
of his proposed bill, Kaufman
said, was to “regulate non-
medical abortions.”

"The state should not regulate
what the physician does. It should
leave the matter up to the deci-
sion of the physician and the per-
sonal feelings of the woman."
said Kaufman.

In answer to questions from
the audience. Kaufman stated that
"if present abortion laws were de-
clared unconstitutional. anyone.
even you. could perform an abor-
tion.“ Kaufman said that his aim
was to “reform present abortion
laws.“

Kaufman also related many of
the political pressures which are
delaying the passage of the bill.
“Powerful members of the House
are against abortion legislation,”
Kaufman told his audience.

Kaufman concluded by saying.

ligious significance, he explained,
is to transcend the “relative field
of life," which consists of experi-
ences and constant changes, and
proceed to “the state of no ex-
perience and ultimate conscious-
nessf‘

Katz underlined the importance
of personal instruction. “The
mind tends to go in the direction of
the greater and more enjoyable
source of happiness,” he pointed
out. “Instruction is needed to di-
rect the mind properly.”

He stressed that it is not essen-
tial “to control behavior, but it is
possible for behavior itself to
changef'

Katz maintained that a notice-
able difference as a result of TM
is “a better relaxed pshyiological
state of the body” which leads to
an increase in creativity and pro-
ductivity. It eliminates a great
deal of tension and stress.”

Katz also asserted that this
change is behavior is exemplified
in interpersonal relations, and
said that its effect is beneficial.
“If people are unfulfilled,” he ar-
gued, “they cannot give fulfill-'
ment to others.

On Tuesday, Dr. Donald N.
Medearis, dean of the Univer- '
sity Medical School, will de-
liver the first of a series of
nine lectures designed to illus-
trate the role of the contem-_
porary health professional.

Dean Medearis will speak on
various aspects of medicine
with highlights upon the wom-
an’s role in the health profes-
sion. This lecture, sponsored
by Alpha Epsilon Delta, the
pre-medical and pre-dental
honor society, will be held at I

reports that the dog has since
passed away. and that he is having
the canine criminal stuffed.

Despite the enormous amount
of time his caperingiconsumes.
Borchin puts in a full week at his
Connellsville barber shop. Even
there, after 41 years at his
trade. he finds time to joke.

Borchin‘s customers have the
unique experience of being groom-
ed in an electric chair. “And I can
cut up to 12 heads an hour in that
chair." boasts Borchin, which
might make you wonder which is
the greater danger, the hair cut
or the chair.

Though the fun-loving Mr. Rain-
bow has a tender spot in his heart
for our University, his days as a
volunteer cheerleader are num-
bered. The Athletic Department,
which originally looked upon Bor-
chin with bemused indulgence,
has stopped laughing.

“This guy is some kind of kook,“
marvelled Sports Information Di-
rector Dean Billick. “We‘ve bent
over backwards to give him a
break, but he's gotten complete-
ly out of hand. He‘s not part of or
paid by the University; he has
appointed himself and seems to
want to take over the chores of
the cheerleaders.”

Billick said that Mr. Rainbow‘s
clowning during the Panther-Kent
State game evoked howls of pro-
test from the cheerleaders. band.
and fans alike. “We finally had to
ask him to stay in his seat," said
Billick. At Syracuse, Borchin was
thrown off the field.

Borchin claims that he is being
treated shabbily by the Universi-
ty. “I was asked by a Pitt stum-
nus to do this. During the Kent
State game, I was chased by a
Pinkerton’s detective, and my
sign was stolen. I'm giving Pitt
thousands of dollars woth of free
publicity.”

To demonstrate his plight. Bor-
chin staged a one-man picket of
Pitt Stadium during a football
practice session. It seems unlike-
ly though that the Athletic Depart-
ment willyield.

“We‘re not trying to stop enthu-
siasm," said Billick. “but this guy

Report Disappoints UCWR 

by SUE HOENSTINE

The University Committee for
Women’s Rights (UCWR) feels
that the administration has mere-
ly glossed over the problems of
sexual discrimination that exist at
Pitt in its Affirmative Action Pro-
gram. ~

In a letter sent to the Depart-
ment of Health, Education, and
Welfare on Nov. 16, Judy Cza-
chowski. president of UCWR.
stated. "Our understanding of an
Affirmative Action Plan includes
identifying existing problems.
originating and implementing pro-
cedures to relieve conditions that
exist based on practices of dis-
crimination. No goals, time tables
or ways to implement specific
methods are included in the Uni-
versity's report.

"Again." she continued, “we
have been disappointed by the
failure of the administration of
this University to take advantage
of what we consider to be a unique
opportunity to originate and car-
ry through on a plan of action that
would end discrimination here at
Pitt.“

Pat Roberts, a spokesman for
UCWR, argued that “the adminis-
didn’t really address
themselves to the problems since
salaries are not specifically men-
tioned in the program and there
are no specifications on the types
of positions the women hold.”

One of Miss Roberts main ob-
jection to the Affirmative Action
Program was that throughout the
224 page report “everything is
directed to either racial minori-
ties or women. We want to be re-
placed with and——we don't want to
be pitted against each other. This
is just a further attempt to sup-
press both groups."

staff (exclusive of faculty) are

women and 11 per cent are Black.
Fifty-one per cent of our 273 tech-
nicians are women and 28 per cent
are Black. The availability of
women is most pronounced in the
office and clerical fields. in which
93 per cent of the 1.234 individuals
are women and eight per cent are
Black.“

Miss Roberts criticized this
segment of the report because
there was no specific documenta-
tion of statistics, there was no
proof of how the administration
arrived at its figures, and because
the professional positions that
women hold were not specifically
defined.

In an analysis of employment
in the School of Dental Medicine.
the Action Program states.
“There are 136 employees. 66 per
cent of whom are females. Twelve
or approximately nine per cent
are minority persons. Goals for
the next year will be to allow a
minimum of three minority per-
sons and increase their utilization
at the secretarila level."

Stating that “this contradicts
the whole purpose of the Affirma-
tive Action Program which should
get women into more influential

positions." Miss Roberts also at-
tacked the administration for fall-
ing to specify the exact number of
women in clerical and profession-
al positions.

The Board of Trustees was not
elaborated upon in the program;
Miss Roberts feels that it repre-
sented a ‘laring exclusion since
no women are board members.

Miss Roberts labelled the adm-
ministration‘s plan to increase
the number of women in faculty
positions as “benign malevol-
encef‘

Since the report doesn‘t specify
that the new women faculty posi-
tions will be full professors. Miss
Roberts pointed out that the ad-
ministration could hire lecturers
and again fail to raise the status
of women. She also stated that a
woman with a Ph.D. gets a salary
comparable to that of a male lec-
turer.

The UCWR representative con-
cluded that the administration
may have done a more effective
job on the Program if they would
have asked HEW what needed to
be changed instead of composing
a wide range of blanket state-
ments to cover up the deficien-
cies.“

Most of the students who were

to mass produce the food. One stu-

that you cook on a mass basis but
you could do better than this.“

The general consensus of the

is very poor in quality. One stu-

Why doesn't

General Electric talk about
thermal pollution when they  

talk about nuclear

 
 

power plants?

General Electric pioneered the
development of nuclear-power plants
in 1957.

Right from the beginning, we felt
that the greatest advantage of nuclear
power was environmental. Unlike
fossil—fueled power plants, nuclear
plants don't burn-anything to make
electricity. And where there’s no fire,
there’s no smoke.

But there’s a possible
disadvantage as well. It, too, is
environmental. Thermal effects.

We recognize it.

One GE advertisement you may
have seen recently pointed out that
”all nuclear power plants discharge
heat, as do fossil-fueled plants.
America’s utilities, with many years
of experience, are working on
thermal problems at nuclear sites on
a plant-by-plant basis."

General flectric does talk about
thermal effects. Because they are
important, but also because we feel
the facts about them are perhaps too
little known.

Few people realize, for example,
that federal law requires utilities to

operate their plants within strict .
temperature limits. Thirty states have
even stricter laws. Utilities are
spending millions of dollars on
dilution flow systems, cooling ponds
and cooling towers to comply.

But, in addition, utilities are
sponsoring basic research on the
problem of heat exchange and its
effect on aquatic life. More than 97

-utilities have been financially

involved in over 300 such studies.
And each one adds a little to man’s
scientific understanding of the
problem.

Some interesting things have

already come of it. For one, it's been '

found that, in some cases, adding
heat to water can actually be
beneficial. Warm irrigation water has
extended growing seasons. Warm
water has created new wintering
ponds along waterfowl migration
routes.

Power—plant discharge water is
reviving Long islands oyster trade.
Florida is using it to grow shrimp and
lobster. In Texas, it's increasing the
weight of commercial catfish by as
much as 500%.

listing these benefits is not to
beg the issue. Thermal effects remain
a tough problem to solve at some
sites. Each plant must be considered

Hetalks about the flick and then gets into his soul

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

You’re both talking rapidly, discussing the merits of the dance, the party, the

concert or the flick. You like him because the air is filled with laughter and he seems '

_to think the ‘same way that you do about things. He's confortable to be with.

He asks you over to his place for a glass of wine and perhaps a smoke. You
agree; not everything has been said.

The room is small and cozy and you immediately notice his stereo unit. Three
speakers, each three feet high. He hands you a large glass of Chianti and begins rum-
maging through his record collection for the appropriate mood music. He spends sev-
eral minutes making the right choice: Wes Montgomery, Simon and Garfunkel, the
Doors. You both sit on the floor.

He talks more about the flick and then gets into his soul.

“You know, I really like going out with you. I have a feeling that you are not
the kind of person who would hurt me,” he begins with a look of pure earnestness in
his eyes. “I haven’t had so much fun with a girl for a long, long time. For a while
there, I though of becoming a monk.”

He speaks with pain and you question him. It's always interesting to find out
how you compare with other women.

“Well, I was going with this one girl for two years and she really screwed me;
went out one day behind my back and screwed another guy. . . . It took me a long time

He decides to take off his shoes and invites you to do the same.

During that whole time, I never enjoyed sex once. Just tried to make a score‘
with every girl I dated. Never cared about the other person. It was sick, I know that,
but my head was so fucked up, I tried to hurt every girl because I had been hurt. It was
.really fucked up." ‘

He insists on refilling your glass every time the level decreases. You refuse,
but he says that “I thought you'd like this wine. I bought it especially for you.” You
give in. ‘

He mentions that the lights are bothering his eyes and would-you—mind-if-i-put-
on-the-black-light? He does so without assent from you.

“You really have nice hair.” he begins, fingering it with his hands. “And I like
blue eyes in a girl” Without warning, he pushes you over and starts tickling you in the
stomach. You tell him loudly that you are not ticklish; he immediately apologizes.

“I want to ask your opinion about something” he says, changing the subject.
“Do you think that sex has to go along with marriage.” You don't want to lie, but at
this point you’re afraid to tell the truth. You opt for the truth: “No.”

“I didn’t think that you would. A lot of girls do, though. The pruitan ethic. But
let me ask you this: You don’t believe that a person has to be in love to have sex, do
you? Do you think that two people can have sex just for pleasure?"

You say yes and he begins to rub your leg. You want to tell him to leave you
alone. But you don't want him to accuse you of being frigid. You’ve heard that so many

 

to get over that one.»I became like a steel box, no emotions, no feeling at all. I never

dated a girl more than once for about a year.”

He leans forward and grabs your hair, bringing his forehead close to yours. He

smiles tenderly. “I was afraid to let myself go for so long,” he says.

He notices that you've drunk about an inclf of your glass of wine and he runs to
the kitchen to bring in the bottle. He refills the receptacle and toasts your health.

Your’re starting to feel it.

You glance obviously at your watch.

Financial crisis Worsens For Colleges

Some Close

Associated Press News Roundup
The financial crisis that peo-
ple in higher education have
been talking about for years may
finally have arrived.

While student unrest and cam-

. pus violence have been attract-

ing much of the time and atten-
tion of college administrators
and the public over the past two
years, several small colleges

have quietly closed their doors,,
-mostly due to financial problems",
and an alarming number of insti-

tutions—including many of na-

tional stature—are now report-:,

ing operating deficits.

“The Day of Judgment is up-
on us,” President Sharvy G.
Umbreck of Knox College told
the Instutute for Educational
Management this summer. “You
will note,” he added, “I did not
forecast its arrival at a future
time. It is here—now."

A. R. Chamberlain, president
of Colorado State University,
said that financing was “the
most serious problem — even
more serious than student dis-
sent — that higher education will
face in the. 1970’s. ”

MDC Accused Of
Shady Practices

Editor, The Pitt News:

In last week’s Pitt News Pres-
ident of MDC, Arnold Steinberg,
and Treasurer Dennis Concilla,
attempted to defend MDC
against recent allegations. Con-
cerning the rental of refrigera-
tors, Concilla “asserted that the
Council had only realized a $3
profit.”

Earlier the two, with MDC
executives Lynn Alstadt and Ru-
dy Potenzone, condemned the
Allocations Committee for pre-
sent practices which were unfair
to students. I

Isn’t it interesting that the
MDC budget which was submit-
ted to the Allocations Committee
in May stated that MDC was
only making a $2 profit, which
enabled MDC to get more money
from our activities fees, plus the
added income of an additional
dollar on every refrigerator
which was rented. , .

Higher education is “in deep
financial crisis,” said Robert W.
Morse, president of Case West-
ern Reserve University, whose
institution has had large deficits
in recent years. This is how
deep:

—Princeton University‘s deficit
in its most recent fiscal year
was $600,000. It projects a
deficit of more than $2-million
for the current fiscal year.

——Christian College in Missouri
is in such desperate financial
straits that it has offered to
rename the institution after
any benefactor who would give
it $5-million. So far, it has had
no takers, but the college has
changed its name anyway—to
Columbia College.

—Columbia University‘s retiring
president, Andrew W. Cor-
dier, said recently, “The defi-
cits started five years ago and
have tended to enlarge every
year." Columbia’s deficit may
reach $15-million this year.

-—St. Louis University has clos-
ed its school of dentistry and
‘is phasing out its engineering
school. The chief reason: in-

Steinberg claims that MDC
“sponsored the original open
houses in the dorms and has
brought many speakers, films
and forums to students." Wasn't
it the constant telephone calls to
the Dean two years ago by stu-
dents who wanted the social
rules changed that got us the
original open houses?

And we would like to know ex-
actly what films. what speakers
and what forums MDC has
brought to students? Perhaps
our memory is unclear, but we
can‘t remember any. The only
films in the dorms are the ones
that the individual houses put on
and not MDC.

Steinberg also claimed that
“MDC is presently involved in
sponsoring the January Concert
of the Month." We were under
the impression that this was a
co-operative effort on the parts
of the Student Union Board.
AWS, MDC, WHB, and Sg. with
the money coming from Student
Government and the Union
Board, not MDC.

Concilla claims that “the $750

adequate financing. In addi-
tion, the university’s trustees _
have instructed the adminis-
tration to lop $1—million from
this year's budget.

—Testifying before a congres-
sional committee this month.
Lloyd J. Elliott, president of
George Washington °Universi—
ty, said his institutions medi-
cal school might have to close
or be turned over to a federal
agency this fall unless it got
financial aid immediately.

—The Very Rev. Robert J. Hen-
le, president of Georgetown
University, said he was gam-
bling on federal funds “or an‘
act of God” to keep his institu-
tions medical school open.

—Preliminary results of a sur-
vey of the nation‘s state uni-

versities and land-grant col- .

leges indicated that 47 of 85
reporting institutions, which
have long prided themselves
on their low-tuition _ policies.
had raised student fees this
year. The most frequently
stated reasons: inflation, the
necessity of maintaining qual-
ity programs and inadequate
state appropriations.

   

that was allocated to MDC . . .
happened last week." At the June
27 meeting of the Student
Government Senate, MDC was
allocated $750 for dances, and
not just last week. Where were
the dances? MDC had a surplus
left of over $1,478.84 and alloca-
tions recommended calling back
$226 of this money as being ex-.
cessive for the needs of MDC.

At that meeting Steinberg ar-
gued against the callback but re-
ceived no new funding, leaving
MDC with the surplus of $1,-
478.84.

Present at that meeting were
also Concilla and Alstadt. MDC
executives, so there is no doubt
that MDC knew what was in
their budget.

Concilla claimed that he just
“received the comptroller sheets
last Monday.“ These sheets
come out once a month so Con-
cilla should have gotten six
monthly sets since June. Even
if the sheets are two months be-
hind Concilla should have still

Additionally we would like to

Concilla questioned Joseph

couldn't speak out against the

reason but when certain individ-

WCUC llefended

in CF, I am replying to the mas-
sive and emotional attack upon

(Continued from Page 4)

that group by Marc Hiller of En-
vironmental Action/Zero Popula-
tion Growth (EA/ZPG) in the
last issue of the Pitt News.

In his response to his attempt
to discredit the biological content
of the exhibit with such numerous
statements as 
been condemned on scientific
grounds by experts" and “Any
biologist will testify there was
misrepresentation of scientific
data," the following proposal is
made:

I personally, and WCUC, pub-
licly challenge Marc Hiller, as
spokesman and statewide co-ordi-
nator of EA/ZPG, to present his
specific allegations of biological
mis-information at_a University
panel discussion on human bio-
logical development and the med-
ical aspect of abortion, or, demand
from hims an apology to WCUC in
the next issue of the Pitt News for
his irresponsible remarks. Marc
Hiller is invited to extract any
statement from my exhibit that
he feels is false.

WCUC can, and has produced
full medical documentation of bio-
logical facts and medical proce-
dures contained in the exhibit and
can present recognized biologists
and geneticists for the above pro-
posed University discussion. Can
Marc Hiller of EA/ZPG do the
same, as he implies. It is curious
Hiller makes only generalized at-
tacks without stating one alleged
scientific mis-statement. A safe
position indeed-but one of cow-
ardess.

Let's quickly dispense with the
pretense by EA/ZPG that their
objective as simply an “education
week” and not indoctrinational
and political in nature. All EA/
ZPG participants were pro-abor-
tionists and the fact that they cir-
culated a petition in support of a
drastically liberalized abortion
bill presented in the Pennsylvania
State Legislature denies its non-
political nature.

EA/ZPG nobly states that “. . .
they are not trying to drown out
the opposition. They wish to meet
them head on.” At the same time
they are feverishly trying to re-
move the opposition (WCUC)
from the campus. This is a puz-
zling confrontation tactic.

WCUC, while not knowing the
personal views of Dr. William
McColough, Dean of the Graduate
School of Social Work, would like
to publicly thank him, as do many
others in the University, for in-
suring academic freedom and
freedom of speech on the Pitt
campus in the face of pressure
from EA/ZPG. Gratitude in in-
suring academic freedom is also
extended to Joseph Colangelo, di-
rector of public relations, and
James V. Cunningham, a lecturer
in GSSW.

It is WCUC’s contention that
they provided balance on an other-
wise biased “information" week
and should receive congratula-
tions from the University and
EA/ZPG for their contribution.

William A. Mogush

Hiller, EA-ZPG
Called Misinformed

Editor. The Pitt News:

In retort to the three articles
re Environmental Action/Zero
Population Growth (Pitt News,
Nov. 20) and their battle with
Women Concerned for the Unborn
Child. let me make a few points.

First. WCUC is not a group of
“professional mothers." Its
members include students and
faculty at Pitt as well as several
activists, who have been involved
in anti-war and radical politics.

Second, the signing of the Uni-
versity permit for the WCUC ex-
hibit by Social Work Dean Wil-
liam McCollough does not involve
approval or endorsement of the
stands of the women’s group. I
would think that the fact that ZPG

, I

. . it has already

has a campus office does not im-
ply University endorsement of
ZPG’s stangs.

Third. Marc Hiller complains
that ZPG planned an educational
program which was sabotaged by
WCUC and made into a political
circus. I question his use of the
word educational since the week's
program‘ as originally planned
was completely one-sided in favor
of abortion.

WCUC was given equal time
only after they requested it: they
were not asked to appear. For the
remainder of the week WCUC set
up literature tables. How is that
political?

Considering that Hiller made
the “politics" charge against
WCUC immediately following the
session where Gerald Kaufman
explained his Pennsylvania House
Bill on abortion—-an event I would
term political rather than educa-
tional—-I fail to see Hi1ler’s logic.

Certainly the poorest of Hi1ler’s
arguments is that he doesn't like
the literature WCUC handed out.
Hiller claims that the info is
scientifically inaccurate, citing.
his own belief that life begins at
birth.

I think that ZPG, instead of
claiming a priority on truth,
should read a few biology books
themselves. That is, if they have
any time, what with worrying
about the Great Pitt Confronta-
tion, starring four mothers. one
baby, two students, and one liter-
ature table.

Mary Quinn Kambic

24hr. Open House
Misdirected Decision

Editor, The Pitt News:

Having just been chased out of
the Hillman library at the 11
o’clock closing time, a certain
irony in the allocation of Universi-
ty funds came to mind.

I was very much in the midst of
an extremely important research
assignment which could have been
properly finished if the library
had only been open a bit longer.
Of course, keeping the libary open
longer would require extra funds
which I am sure you will be quck
to claim are not available.

However, ‘your case would to-
tally lack credibility in the light
of the latest absurd misallocation

which you have apparently per-
mitted without the slightest voice
of dissent.

I trust you are aware that
round-the-clock desk atﬁndents
will now be required in all the
“women‘s" housing because of
some preposterous resolution de-
manding a 24 hour open house.

During my three years at the
University it has become ever in-
creasingly clear that some heads
at the top should be reminded of
their grave responsibilities for
promoting education.

I am suggesting. of course. that
the extra thousands of dollars
which will be spent in salaries for
desk attendants will “benefit“ a
few in the expansion of their so-
cial lives. but in no way contri-
bute to the type of learning experi-
ence which is the responsibility
of University to further.

Cou1dn’t these extra thousands
be far better spent in keeping the
library open a few extra hours?

This housing resolution is but
one of a sizable number of in-
stances in which the University’s
priorities have been totally mis-
directed.

After three years here it should-
surprise me in the least if I were
to read one day that the Universi-
ty plans a progr-am to subsidize
brothels for their social rewards.

Communist Weirdos

Editor, The Pitt News:

It is evident that both Phyllis
Tine and Ben Hour (Wednesday,
Nov. 4, Pitt News) are real, hard-
core communists. They call for
destruction of America’s econom-
ic structure, but they probably
don’t realize how much they de-
pend on it.

What would they do, for in-
stance, without telephones, elec-
tricity, gas, housing, automobiles,
and a hundred other necessities
in a modern society? They are lit-
erally advocating a return to an
economic stone age.

At any rate, they are foolish, be-
cause only a few isolated weird-os
will give up their positions in this
giant economy anyway. It would

Harriers Race

In -NCAA  Meet

by MARTY HELLMAN

For the first time since Coach Jim Banner assumed the coaching '

role of the cross country team five years ago. his harriers have a shot
of taking the coveted national title today.

Earlier this morning at William and Mary College in Williamsburg.
Va.. between 30 and 40 teams raced over the six mile course in the an-
nual NCAA championship.

Afther last week‘s impressive second place showing at the eastern
championships in New York City. the squad established itself as one o
the teams that may place high in --

todaylsrace‘ Sink of Bowling Green Jim Ber-

telson of Ohio U.. John Bednarski
of UTEP and Gary Bjorklund of
Minnesota head the list of prime
candidates for top spot.

Defending champ University of
Texas at El Paso rates as the top
contender while Villanova, who
edged the harriers at the IC4A’s
last week, is another strong en-
try.

Besides these two teams. Ban-
ner cites Michigan State. Bowling
Green, USC, UCLA, Oregon. Ten-
nessee. and Western Michigan. as
the other tough teams.

Banners feels that there will be
a great number of talented indi-
viduals. Steve Prefontaine of Ore-
gon. Donal Walsh of Villanova, Sid

Banner also includes Jerry
Richey, Pitt’s leading runner, as
a potential victor. For the past
two years, Richey has placed in
the top 20 at the NCAA, thereby
giving him All-American status.

Because of the large number of
entrants in the race. Banner
thinks “anything can happen. We
have a good chance to very well in
the meet.“

If the speculating was true. a night's sleep and

have been great to beat Penn State with the riv-

think Syracuse was probably the biggest disappoint-

In a plea for help from

You’d be surprised.

The Paulists listen. But,

Ayers Passes F ms

Monday, November 23, 1970—THE PITT NEWS—Page 7 . 6 

Past Delta Sigma Chi

Delta Sigma Chi had hopes of
winning their first IM football frat
championship. They had played
good football and had upset Delta
Tau Delta and now seemed ready
for Phi Gamma Delta (Fiji). Fiji
however. was ready for another
one of its patented easy victories.

Delta Sigma Chi was blown out
of Pitt Stadium by both the wind
and Jim Ayers‘ fine passing arm.
19-6.

Led by Ayers' running and pass-
ing. Fiji scored first.

He dropped back and hit Wayne
Pile with a 15 yard pass for a
touchdown, the first of his two
first half TD passes.

The solid Fiji‘s came back with

another six-pointer shortly there-
after. This time. Ayers hit Bob

Hull with a 45 yard bomb for a
12-0 lead. The conversion again
failed and the score remained the
same.

In the second half. Fiji again
scored first. The Ayers—to-Pile
combination struck again. with an
eight-yard pass and Fiji‘s 18th
point. Fiji added to its cushion
with a successful conversion from
Ayers to Tom Bursca.

The Fiju defense then held Del-
ta Sigma Chi until the last two
minutes of the game. Delta Sig-
ma Chi scored on a five-yard
touchdown for the final points of
the day.

The confident Ayers and his
squad will now play Stratford
House. the dorm champs inan IM
playoffs.

“After we play Stratford. we
will play the winner of the Inde-
pendent leagues"
Campus championshipl. said. Ay-

ers later. “I'm assuming we beat  - 
Stratford. of course." he contin-  "  '
