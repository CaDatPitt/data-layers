UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

..All - purpose I. D. Cards
To Be Issued Next Term

DEAN HELEN RUSH
Announces ID Card

University students will
have an all-purpose identifi-
 cation (ID) card for the ﬁrst
time next fall. The ID card
will be used by the library,
athletic department, and all

other areas of the University for
veriﬁcation of an individual’s
status.

Dean of Student Aﬁairs Helen
Pool Rush said the University
will entirely ﬁnance the ID card

‘operation. The students will not
‘‘ have ..to pay for the ID cards and
the funds will not be taken from
the Student Activities Fee monies.

At the same time students have
their pictures taken for their ID

\

cards, they will ﬁll out a com-
puter card to be used for the
student directory. Dean Rush
feels this will lead to a more ac-
curate directory since at the time
of the photograph they will know
their Oakland address and phone
number. Students usually do not
know this at the time of registra-
tion. ' 0
Miss Rush has retained James
'G. Smith to direct the_ ID card
operations. smith, an April grad-
uate of _the University, will be

responsible for supervising the

taking of photographs for the ID
cards and will direct the distri-
bution of the completed cards. In-
cluding the area campus enroll-
ment, some 25,000 cards will have
to be made according to Dean
Rush. A

Smith’s office will be located
in the Student Union, since both
photography and card distribu-
tion will take place in the SU
ballroom.

Cards will be color coded so
that there will be a differently’,
colored card for undergraduate,
graduate and special students.
‘While full-time and part-time un-
dergraduate students will have
the same card color only the full-
time student will have his picture
on the card. The same procedure
is being used for graduate stu-
dents.

One of the major advantages
of the card is that it will be com-
puter punched so that it can be

machine-read. It can be used in.

Peace Corps Group  
‘>%To RecruitNext Week

Two Peace Corps volunteers will speak to interested
students tomorrow and Wednesday in the Student Union.
This program is part of a nationwide recruitment for vol-
unteers for the Trust Territory of the Paciﬁc (Micronesia).

tionally skilled peo-ple, because,
we are going to do the training,”

fairs officer of the Peace Corps.

 want about 400 individuals
"to go into training this July.”

The formal screening test which

measures intelligence and lan-

_guage aptitude will be waived
and abbreviated questionnaires
will be used in efforts to speed
up processing.

The new volunteers are being
especially sought for this area at
the request of the Secretary of
the Interior and Ambassador to
the United Nations in cooperation
with the Peace Corps. Micronesia,

, which consists of over 2,000 is- '

it ‘ands, including the'Mariannas,
the Marshalls, and the Carolines,

the United States has been ad-
‘ministering through the Depart-
ment of the Interior, which has
now requested Peace Corps assis-
tance. \

1,600 Freshmen

State - Relatedness Incr

By VICKI EPSTEIN

The University again ex-’

pects to admit a class of 1,-
600 students to the freshmen
class, (800 commuters, 800
residents)‘. When the state-
related program is outlined,

the admissions office may in-.

crease the number of students by
accepting 200 more commuters,
according to Jack- Critchﬁeld,
dean of admissions and director
of student aid. ,
Applications for the Fall tri-

mester will be accepted from the .

commuter students throughout the
summer, if thestate-related plan
is approved.

This year high school seniors
from Pennsylvania and out-of-
state have been admitted at a
proportion of 65 to 35, as in the
past. If the University becomes
state-related before July 1, the
approximated 200 -additional com-.

<1enft~°%’. will .

n .

   
 

.A large increase in the num-
ber of out-of-state students is not
expected until‘ new dormitories
are built. ’Money needed to pur-
chase land for these dormitories
depends on state-relatedness. As-
suming that the University be-
comes state-related this summer,

.Dean Critchﬁeld said, talks will
beheld next year and construc-
tion will begin in the summer.

State-relatedness means that
the University will add 1,000 stu-
dents in all classes; More trans-
fer students have already been
admitted for the fall, and this
spring trimester 52 transfer stu-
dents are enrolled. Transfer ap-
plicants numbered 119, and 55
were selected. These students
vary in classes and ﬁelds with
one in nu’:-‘sing, 43 in liberal arts
and 80 in engineering.

year's freshman class will be

- _ A unique service for evaluating
' and marketing college research
papers, called the Research Writ-
.. ers’ Bureau Ltd., has been estab-
7 lished in the New York area in
response to widespread demand
among publishers for articles on
academic subjects. The ﬁrm is re-
ported to be the first organization
‘ - of its kind to concentrate its ef-
forts entirely on selling campus-
_ written material.
’ According to Richard Fennerly,
director of the literary agency,
‘there are thousands upon thou-
sands of periodicals, ranging from
' , -the smallest journals to some of
the largest “slick” magazines,
which need well-researched stu-
dent manuscripts. He reports that
‘ some of these pay up to ten cents
per word for this material.

“Academic journals are usual-
ly the ﬁrst and too often the last
place students consider as an out-
let for their work,” Fennelly says.
“This is lamentable because there

_ are numerous semi-popular mag-
_ azines which pay decent money
for research writing. They cover

a wide ﬁeld of interest, including

science, religion, history, medi-

cine, and business.” Virtually

every area of college study has
___some representation in this type
of periodical, according to the
ﬁrm’s director.

The new agency, which does
not return manuscripts unless
first queried with description
of the paper, is located at 95-31

Replaces Pepsiifjeneration ,

 Byronic Bond begins Era

Associated Collegiate Press

With the coming of James
Bond, the Pepsi generation
seems to have changed to the

- Bond‘ era, says‘ the South

Coloradan, Adams State Col-

lege, Alamosa, Col. Not only
has the Byronic James Bond be-
come a hero but also an idol of
imitation. The colognes and the
after-shave lotions depict the
piercing eyes of Bond 007. From
sweat shirts to cigaret lighters to
pistols and deodorants . . . li-
censed to kill women. '

With the coming of the motion
picture Dr. No, a bold venture,
Bond was raved about and the
actor, as the image of James
Bond, became a celebrity. Now
one looks forward to the next
Bond episode. Now to go behind
the scenes to examine the geni-
us of two men, the writer Ian
Fleming and the actor Sean Con-
nery.

Fleming was a wartime assis-
tant to the director of Naval In-
telligence in Britain. A lover of
adventure and thrills, he was a
product of Eaton and Sandhurst
(the British parallel of West
Point) and for a time a reporter,
editor, columnist and ﬁnally au-
thor. He liked the excitement and
novel adventure of his job as a
Reuters correspondent in Russia.
As to the origin of James Bond,
Fleming said there “was such a
character” in the British Secret
Service but under a different
name. He wanted a dull-sounding
name, so he chose that of a for-
mer ornithologist, James Bond.

He wrote about 10 Bond novels;
four of them—Dr. No, From Rus-
sia with Love, Goldﬁnger and
Thunderball -— were made. into
movies. Fleming himself had a
spy-like background and wrote
with precise detail. He has been
criticized for overdoing sex and
violence in these novels, but that
is the world of the secret agent-
exotic living and quick thinking.

Sean Connery was surprised
when called upon to become
James Bond in Dr. No. The Scot-
tish-born actor was the son of a
mill worker. He had planned to
become a professional football
player, but instead diverted his
energy toward acting. Like many
British actors, he started his ca-
reer acting in Shakespearean
plays. Connery considers the.
Bond image a burden but “one
just has to learn to live with it.”
In real life, he is not the swash-
buckling, debonair James Bond.

Bond is a dedicated man. All
he does, in pleasure or pain, is
for “King and country.” Women
and sex are but a part of his
duty and assignments. Women
are infatuated by his aloof atti-
tude. He is a personiﬁcation of
the raw—musculine man, cruel
and ruthless if need be. He is
tender only when extracting in-
formation from a cooing female
victim. ,

Thunderball, the latest Bond
episode, set in the beauty of the

Except one,

~‘ A , Bold New Breed by

 

Bahamas, depicts nocturnal de-
lights of scanty-clad nymphs, add-
ed to a huge arsenal of marine
warfare. Lavish extravagance is
essential in Bond movies. This has
been criticized as being “too far
out,” but Sean Connery defended
it by saying, “It is all a. device
to remove time.” _,.

James Bond has a caliber of
his own, a taste different from
all other spies and secret agents.
The extravagance and precise-
ness hold him high above the
rest of the crowded spy era.

‘rug Usage Does
‘ Not Help Awareness

, The use of drugs——from mari-
1‘ juana and amphetamines to LSD,
 DMT and peyote-—is now a ma-
 jor controversy. Psychedelic or
_J “consciousness-expanding" drugs
 can provide experiences so im-
; pressive and profound that more
zaand more people are looking to
them as the most immediate and
effective way to deepen personal
insight and expand awareness.
That these experiences are im-
pressive is a well-established fact
with us; we have actively follow-
ed drug research from its earliest
 roots and are thoroughly fami-
 liar with the enchantments of
I almost every facet of psychedelic
. _i indulgence. Searching for lasting
1 positive value, however, we con-
 cluded that drugs constitute only
a subtle escape from the con-
scious effort that eventually must
be made.
i Although drug enthusiasts fre-
quently turn to Eastern philoso-
«phers and spiritual teachings for
metaphors to describe and justi-
fy their psychedelic experiences,

      
 

- have ever sanctioned the use of
.,_udrugs in the quest of increased
 awareness and enlightenment.
ff} Here the statements of Avatar

 Meher Baba are pertinent. Baba
'3 is a non-sectarian spiritual Mas-
 ter—living now in India-—who is
acknowledged East and West as
the authority on higher states of
consciousness. (For one, U.S. psy-
chedelic spokesman Dr. Richard
Alpert recognizes Baba’s mastery
in this ﬁeld.)

- ‘When consulted about psyche-.
delics, Baba replied: “The ex-
periences which drugs induce are
as far removed from reality as is
a mirage from water. No matter
how much you pursue the mirage-
you will never quench your thirst,

them elated. But this elation is
only temporary. It gives only ex-
perience of illusion, and serves to
take one farther away from real-
ity. The feeling of having had a
glimpse of higher states of con-
sciousness may only lull one into
a false security. Although LSD is
not a physically addicting drug,
one can become attached tothe
experiences arising from its use,
and one gets tempted to use it in
increased doses, again and again,
in the hope of deeper and deeper
experiences. But this can only
lead to madness.” .

Our experience corrobortaes
Baba’s statement: drugs of any
kind inevitably become a blind
alley for self-fulﬁllment. To rely
on external means is to ignore
one’s inherent capacity to realize
his own greatest potential.

Diligence Rewarded

In a world where it sometimes seems only the dramatic and publicized receives
raise, it is both refreshing and reassuring to see the quiet dignity of the Late Dr. S1tan-
-ton Crawford so honored by his peers. The recent actions of the Board of Trustees 8‘ 01'1-
fy a man who never sought praise but was always readily deserving of it. _

In his 43 years of service to the University Stanton Chapman Crawford altered lit-
tle his basic attitude toward life and or his manner of dealing with people. Essentially a
scholar, he gave to each new situation energy and verve in the hope of improving the world
around him. He never looked for recognition and only hoped to have accomplished some-
thing in the course of his duties. . ' _
 It is our hope that somewhere in -the new Stanton Chapman Crawford natural sci-
 ences building there would be placed a biography of Dr. Crawford. Let it. be a guide to
1. those who wonder if this world still has a place for the quiet and the diligent.

Playboy (Magazine

Wants Comments.
In the May issue of Playboy
magazine, Editor-Publisher Hugh
M. Hefner continues his discus-
sion of the inequities of U.S. sex
laws with an examination of the
dilemmas raised by prostitution.
Hefner outlines the basic faults

and contradictions of American .

laws governing. prostitution:

“Prostitution ﬂourishes speciﬁ-
cally because of the double stan-
dard that exists for male and fe-
male morality, and the prostitu-
tion laws of the United States
are, themselves, patently anti-fe-
male. If prostitution is consider-
ed a crime, then it is logical to
assume that both the participants
in the criminal act—the woman
who sells her sexual favors and
the man who purchases them —
are guilty. But in a number of
states, the prostitute—and every-

one associated with her in her_

profession except the cu_stomer—
is included under the law.” '

We would appreciate having
your comments on this complex
legal, moral and human problem
for publication in the Playboy
Forum or not, as you desire.

Drug Problem Viewed 
I By Vicki Epstein

College students throughout the country are experi-
menting with hallucinogenic drugs and marijuana. In this
age of new and different things they want to get to know
themselves better and LSD and pot may be one way.

While drugs are used by teenage slum dwellers as a
means of escaping their standard of living and environment, \
college students smoke pot or take pills to escape alienation
brought on by large metropolitan multiversities that id_en- ﬂ
tify them by IBM numbers. If drugs succeed in reaching  ~
that inner being, the experimenting coed develops a psychic
need. He is not a drug addict however. Addiction means that
the user has become physically dependent on the drug. But
students taking pills or smoking pot are doing it for psy-
chological needs and are able to stop any time they feel
mentally strong enough. _ .

For example, to create excitement before a big foot-
ball game or to keep awake while cramming or writing a
term paper, students take stimulants called “bennies”- and
“pep pills.” For relaxation or to promote sleep before ﬁnals,
a big date or when worried “goof balls” (barbiturates) are
available. I

Although stimulants and sedatives are the most com-
mon pills on campuses, pot is also abundant. Smoking mari-
juana does not lead to mental or physical deterioration. nor‘
to addiction. It is psychologically habit forming like “ben-

ies” and “goof balls.” There are no symptoms or with-

rawal and no deaths have resulted, according to the La-
Guardia Report of 1944 issued by the Academy of Medi-
cine. All sense of value is lost when affected -by pot and
promiscuity, without being‘ aware of it, is common but not
a direct result. A sensation of ultimate power may be
created and will be extremely dangerous to an abnormal per-
son phychically and mentally dependent. on marijuana.

The effects of marijuana, stimulants and sedatives are
known to doctors but the status of hallucinogenic drugs, 
drugs that affect the mind sometimes causing visions or .‘
hallucinations, is ambiguous. Although itwas ﬁrst manu-
factured by a Swiss laboratory in 1943, LSD is still in the
experimental and" research stages. Scientists know that one
dosage may lead to deep insights by some people, no reac-
tion by others and permanent mental changes, perceptual
distortion of time and space and distortion of one’s judg-
ment bydifferent people. Fantasies stimulated by LSD have
compelled victims to loaf, be apathetic towards external ob-
jects although feeling. intense color phenomena and to feel 
superior and personally insensitive. - "

The mystique of LSD has made experimentation by
college students even more daring. Undergraduates at Har-
vard University responded positively when two professors
tested LSD’s psychological effects. These men -gave LSD"
as capsules and sugar cubes costing $3-$5 and believed that
it was the cure for all psychological ills. Others found that
the ten to 12 hours under the inﬂuence of one dosage of LSD
is neither better nor worse, than standard psychotherapy.

-' :-

_.The number of students experimenting with pot or.» ,
LSD is estimated at ten per cent but that number is grow-@"
ing. These drugs are being illegally bought, sold and used.

If -caught charges set ‘by the Federal Narcotic Control Act

of 1956 would be for a ﬁrst offense imprisonment for not \
less than ﬁve years and much stricter for a second or subse-
quent offenses and offenses of transferring narcotic drugs
ormarijuana to a person under 18 years of age.

The ﬂr_st time they smoke pot or take drugs for kicks,
experimenting college students are not aware of these facts.
AdI_n1H1StI'at0rs may be horrified to discover drug usage on
their campus but the situation is nationwide. Policemen ’ .
throughout the country are testifying as Police Chief Johnﬁm

~ R. Juba did after a recent raid at Pennsylvania State Uni-K?-:-2

1versi_ty.h“We’re not saying it’s serious, but we feel the prob-
em ‘is ere. And we re not quitting now; we’re going to
continue on this thing.” He added that those arrested were
not what you (1 call habitual users.” The dean of a different

university said that he “doubts there is a college anywhere
in the country where narcotics is not a serious problem ”

The reason for drug usage are not. as important as
recognizing the situation. If_the problem is great on this
campus,.the only possible solution would be free discussion
and seminars.

 Attitude, Accelerates Times

By Tom Sacks
Sports Editor

, ,(,_The setting was the 220-yard dash at the second annual
' Big Four” track and ﬁeld meet at the Stadium last week.
, printer Dick Crout jumped into a quick lead from the
cks, but Syracuse’s Ron Manne overhauled Crout going
to the ﬁnal turn. Then something happened which Crout
ill ﬁnds hard to explain.
 _' Reminiscing about the‘ race, the senior from nearby
ilkinsburg, separated his hands by several inches. “I beat
m by this much,” grinned Crout. “Last year if the situa-
n‘ had been the same I would havesettled for second. But
I  for some reason I wanted the race a lot and
V I pushed for it.”

* If Crout ﬁnds his attitude hard to ex-
plain, observers must ﬁnd his winning time
of 22 seconds even harder to explain. For
in high school he once covered the same dis-
tance in 21.4 seconds.

It doesn’t take an Einstein to ﬁgure out
that a runner’s time should normally drop
. in college, but then again even Einstein
‘would be befuddled with the track situation at the Univer-
it/Y.

 At Wilkinsburg, Crout ran the 100-yard dash and the
3220. At Pitt he has been running the quartermile, followed
fby" the 220. Running the 440 prior to the 220 has hurt
‘Crout’s times in his specialty.

 But these reasons still aren’t enough to account for
Crout’s reversal since his high school days.

_ _ Despite eight years of coaching, Crout claims he “has-
 ’t reached his peak yet. I had natural speed in high school.
it ollege is -supposed to build you up, but I don’t think I’ve

-riefcchio, considered one of the ﬁnest sprinters to ever come

gh school and both were consistently clocked under ten
_ econds for the event.

' DelVecchio, who was a year ahead of Crout, held down
the starting berth for the 100 until he graduated last year.
0 _ Crout approached his coach, Carl Rees, at the beginning
f this season to offer to take DelVecchio’s place in the 100.
e never received an answer and in last week’s meet the win-
'ng time for the fast sprint was ten seconds ﬂat.'Pitt didn’t
ve an entrant.

.._,Crout, who also won the
40 that day besides the 220,
ould still rather have train-
dfor the dash than for the
uarter. He feels he could
ecuperate better for the 220

Training and motivation
e probably the two best
ids a runner can have work-
_ ng for him. Somewhere be-
tween his freshman and sen-
oryear Crout lost most of
is motivation. “When I was - '
high school I really loved DICK GROUT

_ck, but it hasn’t been till Strains at finish-

is year that I've started to regain that love for the sport.
“For some reason I didn’t feel that I was running for
he school or even a team. There was just a general attitude
nthe team of no one seeming to care. It was really de-
moralizing.

N .4 There is one reason for Crout’s sudden shift of attitude
his year. It’s the reason for which he gave that extra effort
n‘ the 220. The reason is DelVecchio.

 M ‘‘Bill has been tutoring me this year. His help has been
the biggest motivation that I’ve had since I’ve been at Pitt.
M-’ve got the right attitude back now. If my workouts had
nly’ been organized differently earlier, I probably would
ave developed a lot faster this year than I have.”

  
  
   
  

  

_ : At the pace he has been setting for himself and with
elVecchio pushing him, Crout has an excellent chance of
arning an invitation to the NCAA’s at the close of the sea-
Vgn. It’s quite a comeback considering that somewhere, some-
thing or somebody killed his love for his sport.

WVU Defeats Mitters, 2-0;

Rain, Cold Shatters Schedule

By GEORGE LIES

What a difference a year
makes. At this time last sea-
son, the baseball team own-
ed a 14-3 record and was headed
toward the NCAA playoffs. This
year, after being shutout for the
second time by West Virginia,
2-0, last Wednesday, the team
stands 5-5 and an NCAA bid is
merely a dream.

The calibre of pitching, com-
paring the two teams, could be
called equal. However, the hitting
this year can’t compare.

“wé don’t'have too many .300-
hitters this year,” coach Bobby
Lewis said. Last year Lewis had
Fred Mazurek, who hit .466. “The
team could count on Freddie get-
ting two hits every game. He
would either drive in that run or
get one and start a rally.

“This season thereis no con-
sistency with the batters,” con-
tinued Lewis. “Before the West
Virginia game, (Phil) Nasrallah

was hitting over .400 and so I in- ‘

sserted him fourth in the lineup.
He went 0-4, striking out three
times.” Third baseman Tom Beck-
ett saw his average drop from
.290 to .256 after going hitless in
five at bats against WVU’s strong
righthanders. ’
Against the Mountaineers, the
mitters had ample opportunities
to score. Three times the bases
were loaded. “All we needed was
a ﬂy ball to score a run,” Lewis
said.
Starting pitcher Dave Welty
completed the game, striking out
ten batters. He allowed only ﬁve
hits to four hits apiece given up
by Vaughn, Kovachs and winning
pitcher Jerry Meadows of WVU.
The Mountaineers made the
most of four Panther errors, two
each by Welty and Beckett, but
the mitters stranded 13 runners.
“There should be a column (in
the box score) reading ‘left on
base,”’ said Lewis. “Sure we got
the hits but we didn’t score;
they’re no good if you don't
bunch them.”

Inconsistent hitting is not the
only concern of Lewis. Poor

Tennis Team
Serves Ball  
To Bethany

In the past decade Bethany
College has been noted as being
one of the top small colleges in
the country when it comes to pro-
ducing tennis talent. This year is
no exception, as coach Ben Pope
and the tennis team must know.

The netters travel to Bethany
today after a week that ended in
one victory and one defeat. On
Tuesday they defeated Slippery
Rock by a 6-3 county. Marty Lie-
bowitz, Erik Lieberman, Bill Gold-
stein, and Tom Farben won sin-
gles matches for the netters, while
Bill Nichols and Lieberman, and
Liebowitz and Goldstein won.-in
the doubles. /

The tennis team had a match
with cornell scheduled for last
Thursday, but they were rained
out for the fourth time this year.

On Saturday_the netters went
to Syracuse and were defeated
by the Orangeman 5-4. Nichols
and Goldstein were the only win-
ners in singles, and Nichols and
Lieberman won their doubles
match as did Liebowitz and Gold-
stein. This defeat left the netters
't a ‘

  

weather conditions, since the be-
ginning of the campaign, have
cancelled seven games and num-
erous practices. Besides playing
the WVU game in a downpour,
weekend games with Colgate and

Two home games, against St.
Vincent and Allegheny, are sched-
uled at Leech Farm Roam (off
Washington Blvd.) this Wednes-
day and Saturday.

Syracuse were canceled.

“We want to play,” Lewis said
of his team. “There is nothing
more demoralizing than rain.”

Looking at the statistics, Lew-
is. ﬁgures this team should be un-
defeated “any .time four pitchers
have earned run averages under
3.00.” Through ten games the
pitching records are:
