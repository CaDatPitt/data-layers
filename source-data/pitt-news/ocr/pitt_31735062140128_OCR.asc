Badly outclassed and outweighedl
the Carnegie Tech team again suf-‘l
fered defeat at the hands of thel
Varsity on Saturday at Forbes Field.)
The ﬁnal score was 35 to 0, but it
looked at one time as if the Techites
were going to break in on the no-
score record of the season. It was
right at the beginning of the game
when Budd fumbled a punt on the
10-yard line and a Tech man recov-
ered it. No attempt was -made to
make a touchdown, but Hull immedi-
ately dropped back to kick a ﬁeld
goal. Nothing looked easier in the
world, but the ball failed to go be-
tween the uprights. Yet this Was
not to be the end. Referee Fry had
seen a Pitt man offside as he penal-
ized the Blue and Gold ﬁve yards,
and Tech found themselves in a still
better position to score three points.

boot the ball over the cross piece, but
in vain. The ball sailed far wide and
their golden opportunity to mar
Pitt’s clean record was forever lost.

With the spirit of ﬁght in their
veins at having so nearly been scored
upon, the Pitt team sailed in and in
three tries landed tne ball over the
line for the ﬁrst touchdown. Budd
was credited with the tally and Gal-
vin added the goal, making the score
6 to 0. V

In the second period it took but a
few minutes for the Pitt backﬁeld
men to rush the ball over the line
after Galvin had nabbed onto a Tech
forward pass. However, he failed to
kick goal, making the score 11 to O.
The. third touchdown came when
Peacock grabbed an onside kick on
the two-yard line and Brown carried
it over the line on the next play.
Soon after the subsequent kick-off,
Wagner, who played a very credit-
able game at fullback in the absence
of Captain Richards, got away for a
42-yard dash that made people sit up
and take notice. Quailey followed by
making a nice forward pass to Lind-
say and then carried it over from the
two-yard line. Peacock ﬁnishedthe
scoring of the ﬁrst’ half by recovering
a Tech punt that had- been blocked by
one of the Pitt linesmen and getting
over the line for a touchdown. The

lWE’speranto suffered a terrible blow

THE PRESENT AND THE
FUTURE.

The University of Pittsburgh was a
few years ago a quantity unknown in
this community because it did 'not
have thelmeans to expand properly,
but today it looms up as a wonder.-
ful factor in the future life of Pitts”-
burgh and its environs. No institu-
tion« has placed before it colors more
brilliant, prophesying a life that is to
be the power and moving force of the
western half of this State. In a few
short years the "hillside of the Schen-
ley estate will be adorned with an ar-
ray of structures quite in harmony
with the great institution they repre-

sent; what was once the rolling hill

will be the seat of a university, whose
bounds and inﬂuence will be measured
by the tongues of men over the vast

extent of earth.

‘Such is the future of our University.

Vastly more important is the ques-
tion, what are you doing for the Uni-
versity today! Are we making use of
every opportunity to advance the
cause of the institution? .

Are the hours spent here being util-

. ized for the future of our own lives.

so that the world may know the real
beneﬁtlderived from the work in the
class. room and the laboratory? In
the hum-drum of student life it ap-
pears that we are wearily plodding
on with no very deﬁnite destination,
just a merry little journey for the
amusement of the faculty and a nice
way for father to spend money- Such,
however, is not the purpose of the
stay‘ in the University a_nd it is to that
end we should look when the value
of our labor is being considered in
the light of the present.

. Student life is not, to be sure‘, a
very serious proposition and when "I
man becomes so occupied with his
serious bents, then he had best make
preparation to change his environ-
ment for the reasoning is all Wrong.
The successful student is not the one
who makes his work a continuous
grind, but, the man who ﬁnds a happy
medium is the really clever one after
all. It is possible, therefore, to get a
great deal of good from the Univer-
sity and at the same time be able by
deed and action to do a littleservice
that is.t0 the advancement of the in-
stitution in the eyes of the corn-
munity.

The future of the University of
Pittsburgh is certain to be a bright
one, but the duty of those nowwithin
her walls is to strive each day to do
something which will be of value to
the present.

Several people faint_ed last .weel<
during the parade on Fifth avenue on
account of the great congestion
caused by the University students.

Possibly  and J. is not so thank-
iful as we are. They should be glad
it was no worse.

We could eat with more satisfac-
tion tomorrow if we knew the out-

come. of that game.

.Ohl well the Fresh didn’t win a

game last year,—so 1914 is not so bad.

RULES NoT ATFFAULT.

Week before last the sad lesson. of
aifatality on the football ﬁeld was
learned bv a college not a great dis-
tance from the city, and while it is
not for us to comment on the pos-
sible points of law involved in the
case it is permissible to hazard an
opinion ‘on the new rules and their
part in the reduction of the accidents
on the ﬁeld this year- The new code
was established to avoid just such an
occurrence as took place at Wheel-
ing week before last and it is hardly
fair to attribute the result of the un-
fortunate affair to the working of the
revised rules. Football is primarily a
game for men who are able to control
their passions to such an extent that
the mere pass or touch of an arm is
not accepted as proof of a desire to
injure. ,New rules‘ or old ones can
not regulate the workings of human.
nature and so the pessimist must ﬁnd
some other- cause to trace the acci-
dent at Wheeling. The rules, as
formulated this season, have made it

possible to witness a clean, fast game V

without the piling up ,of previous‘
years, which was surely a large fac-
tor in the many distressing deaths
on the ﬁeld. There are defects in the
1910 rules, but it appearson the face
of the reasoning that they have im-
proved things materially. The splen-
did open game made possible by‘ the
new rules is an enjoyment both to the
players and the spectators alike, for it
permits the one to get in some very
excellent playing and the other a
chance to witness the ﬁne parts of the
contest. -

There have been deathsthis Vear.
and there will be as long as the
game is played, for no man is ab-
solutely immune to the working of
nature if her -laws are infringed upon»

From present indications the road-
way will be ﬁnished in time to cele-
brate along with the opening of the
Panama canal in 1915.

,' RESOLUTION IS PASSED.

,,,The student senate met in special ses-
siion last Friday -afternoon and passed
the following resolution:

To Dr: S. B. McCormick:

Whereas, God in his all-wise provi-
dence has seen fit 0 takeout of this
life William H.  McCormick, the
brother of our belovezd Chancellor.

Be it resolved, That?-_, the student sen-
ate in behalf of the sttident body of the
University of Pittsbvurgili, extend to Dr.
McCormick and his family their heart-
felt sympathy in this, the time of their
bereavement. Signed,

The Student ‘Senate.

CAUSES SCARE.

Dallenbach, the star Varsity linesman.
caused the University .students a huge
chill last week when the announcement
was made concerning his threatened ill-
ness. ’ For a time matters looked a triﬂe
squally, b-ut it is certain ‘fD.a.1ly” will be

_at his position tomorrow.

Mistake is Made.

State Sale of‘ Seats is Somewhat
Changed From The: First An-
nouncement.

The various places of seat Selling
for the State-Pitt game were be-
seiged by an anxious throng early last
Monday morning in the hope that the
early buyer gets the choice seats.
But the energetic ones were rudely
annoyed by the bland smile of the
man behind the counter who said.
“Not until Thursday, thank you.”

The original announcements were

wrong and the error naturally re- .

sulted from the incorrect statement.
The same scale of prices will prevail
for the Thanksgiving Day as at the
W. and J. game, tickets being on sale
at Spauldings, the Hotel Schenley
and the Atwood pharmacy, as usual.

GRADUATES OF LEADING
UNIVERSITIES DOING

WORK AT PITT, ‘

Appropos of a recent statement of
an institution in the city it may be
interesting to note the leading Uni-
versities which are represented in the
University of graduate students.
There are three Yale graduates, one

*1

graduate of Syracuse, ‘one graduate ,

of Cornell, one graduate of Engineer-
ing School, Laoben, Austria, two
from India, one from Alaska, are do-
ing special advanced metallurgical
work under Professor Goodale.

 

JUNIOR CLASS MEETING.

The Junior class of the college and
engineering departments met ‘ last
Monday morning for reports on the
progress of the Owl and the appoint-
ment of the Junior Prom. committee.
The second payment on the class
memorial fund falls due the early
part of the next month and the mem-
bers of the class were reminded of
the nearness of the date. The Owl
board reported splendid progress on
the annual and the excellent efforts

_of the editors to make the book in

keeping with the University.

STEPS -ARE ERECTED.

Steps Leading to Pennsylvania Hall
Are Erected to the Joy of the
Med. Students.

The long stretch extending from
Boquet street, in Oakland, ‘has been
greatly improved by the addition of
a ﬂight of stairs, which will make
the medical college of very easy ac-
cess from the Fifth and Forbes street
car lines. The steps have been con-
structed up the incline which was
used during the building operations
last winter.

ATTENDS CONFERENCE.‘

Rufus D. Smith, of the Department
of Sociology and Economics, was in
attendance at the conference held at
Altoona la_st week in the interest of
charitable work in this State.‘ Ad-
dresses. were made by many noted
authorities on the work being ‘dis-
cussed.

score at the end of the ﬁrst half was
29 to 0.

In the third half nothing was added
to the score by the Pitt team. Tech

played hard and, aided by several
penalties, managed to keep their
heavier opponents from scoring.

Lindsay attempted to negotiate a

"ﬁeld goal from the 37-yard line but

failed.

In the last quarter Dewar and Dave
Richards consistently worked the ball
down‘ the ﬁeld, making one ﬁrst down
after another until Dave Richards
went over for the ﬁnal tally. Galvin
kicked the goal, completing the score
of 35 to 0.

OTHER TECH GAMES.

Tech’s recent'defeat in the hands
of Pitt was by no means the ﬁrst.
In fact Tech has never won a game
from Pitt in its entire career. In
1906 they ﬁrst aspired to the gridiron
game and were badly beaten, 31 to 0.
The next year they did better, hold-
ing their rivals to a 0 to 0 score. but
in 1908 they dropped into mediocrity
again, when a 22 to 0 score was
rolled up against them. The game
was played in 1909, and this year they
have received the wqrst wolloping in
their history.

Nevertheless Tech has shown great
spirit and is worthy of a better team.

"May the time soon come when our

friends across the street will get to-
gether an aggregation that will prove
a worthy foe for the Blue and Gold
Varsity, and one that it will mean
something to defeat.

_TI—IE PITT WEEKLY

Penn On Our Schedule

Annual Game Between Pitt and
Penn Ought to Be" Feature.

The football season this year has been
the most prosperous in the history of
the University, and it is only ﬁtting that
some speculation be made for the Year
coming. When thinking along this line
one cannot fail to be impressed by the
fact that Pennsylvania’s three greatest
teams should meet each year to deter-
mine the championship of the State.
These three, being the University of

Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania State Col-

lege and the University of Pitts-
burgh. It is the custom each year
for the teams of Penn State to meet on
the gridiron both the representatives of
Penn and Pitt, but the two Universi-
ties of the Statehave never met in the
great outdoor sport. The present sea-
son has proved beyond all doubt that
we are to be reckoned with when a
football team is under consideration and
that means we are entitled to have a
chance to rank with our big Eastern
friend, the University of Pennsylvania.
The contest would be a big drawing
card for both of the teams, for the
down East Institution has a large num-
ber of friends and alumni in Pittsburgh,
which, coupled with the great outpour-
ing of Pitt adherents, would form one
of the largest crowdstever attending a
game in this city. The crowd would not
be the only satisfaction to be derived
from the contest, as it would also be
the means of determining without a
doubt the championship of the State.

Nothing oﬂicial can be secured from
the authorities, but there is a strong
undercurrent going the rounds these
days that points rather forcibly to the
possibility of Penn being scheduled next
season. Here’s hoping we do play the
Red and Blue.

Last Monday was declared an of-

that the students might enjoy the ex-

To »this end great preparations were
made for the proper observance of
the day; a permit-was askedfor the
parade and a band was engaged to
play sweet strains of music, that the
marchers might be inspired to walk
ill a straight and orderly line.

As a result of these gorgeous plans
the halls and corridors of the building
were literally jammed with students,

‘pressing in eager haste to join th-e

throngs of exultant marchers. At
times it was feared the ﬂoors might
collapse as a result of the terriﬁc

Where We Are Going but We Are

line of

curve swept into Fifth avenue- Traf-
lic on that thoroughfare was tied up
for a half an hour on account of the
University parade.

the tale. Suffice it to say the holiday
planned for last week was a colossal
failure, and the students are to‘ blame.
not the few hard workers who hustled
to make the day a success.

Vi/. H. H. MCCORMICK DIES.

VVilliam Henry Harrison McCormick
aged 46 years, a 'well—known telegraph
operator and a brot-her of Chancellor
S. B. McCormick, of the University

7628 Mulford street.- He was the son
of Dr. James I. McCormick and was
born in Faivrﬁeld, Westmoreland county.

Must Win to

  Hold Trophy

State Now Has Two Legs on the
Spalding Tropy—— Pitt's. Last
Chance Tomorrow.

The Spalding trophy, for which Pitt
and State will battle tomorrow, is in
danger of being lost to the Center
county collegians if the scor.e is unfavor-
able this year.

The trophy was offered by A. G.
Spalding & Bros. in 1908, under the
condition that the winner of the annual
Thanksgiving day game between P-itt
and State should have possession of it
each year, and at the end of ﬁve years
the _team_ having won the majority of
the games should gain permanent pos-
session.

In 1908 Penn State won its first leg
on the trophy, when Larry Vorhis
kicked three ﬁeld .goals against the Blue
and Gold and won the game for the
Center county collegians 12 to 6. Last
Thanksgiving it was brought to Pitts-
burgh for exhibition, but State’s 5-0 vic-
tory over the university eleven led by
Captain Homer Roe put it in their pos-
session for another year. Under, the
terms which the trophy was given, State.
by winning Thursday, would gain per-
manent possession of it after two more
years, even though Pitt should win in
1911 and 1912. On the other hand,
Pitt, by coming out victorious in this
year's Thanksgiving day struggle
would be in a position to even up with
State in l9ll. L

THE PITT WEEKLY

   

Big Game is On To-day

 

Fresh Meet the Sophs This Af-

ternoon.

The annual game between the Fresh
and the Sophs is to take place this aft-
ernoon at Forbes Field. Inasmuch as
the present Sophs made a record equally
as good as the Fresh of this year, name»
ly, the failure to win a game during
their career as ﬁrst year men, the betting
ought to be about even. The class teams
have not divulged their respective line-
ups, but we have been told that several
surprises may be looked for before the
game is over. Varsity men are barred
from competition in this contest.

NOTED PLAY IS DISCUSSED.
T-he class in the study of dramatic

‘literature was treated to a surpriseand

an op-portunity to enjoy a discussion -of
one of the most talked-"of plays of the

year last Friday morning when Profes—. _

sor "Gibbs delivered a lecture on the

~ - ' celebrated play by Rostand, “Chantecler.”

The lecture comprised a brief survey of
the entire play, and, while not compre-
hensive, owing to the short space of
time devoted to» the talk, the students
were able to gain an’ appreciation which
will aid materially in the reading of the

FRESH LOSE To INDIANA.

 

School Proves Too-
Strong for the University Fresh.

Last Monday the Freshmen football
team was defeated by the Indiana Nor-
mal eleven 44 to 0 on the latter’s ﬁeld.
The Freshmen were unable to do any-
thing against the heavy Normal team,
but, the score does not indicate. the
splendid playing which occurred at
times through the game.. The Normal
school has an unusually good team this
year and it is not to be wondered at that
the 1914 boys were so harshly treated.

DR‘. SMITH IS ELECTED.

 

Pleads for Leniency When Speech is
Called For.

C. In an outbur.st of enthusiasm at the
news of the election of Dr. Edgar F.
Smith as provost of the University of
Pennsylvania, 5,000 students paraded
about the campus in West Philadelphia
last Wednesday, broke -into class rooms,
separated students from their professors

’called upon the deﬁns of the various

departments for speeches and declared
a holiday.

GET , A PENNANT!

Hey fellows! Be sure you have a

pennant for the big State game. Each
student should have one.
_,_What an inspirin-g scene the Pitt
rootingsection would present with a
thousand waving pennants and :1
thousand cheering students as the
team appears on the ﬁeld. This oc-
casion is" one that will be long remem-
bered. '

The more youwave your pennant
the harder you can root!

5 Tech Receives Fine Gift

Andrew Carnegie Donates Mil-
lion and Half to School Bear-
ing His Name..

The practical completion of the Car-
negie Technical Schools, as originally
planned, was made possible last week by
a gift of $1,500,000 from Andrew Car-
negie. The ironmaster’s donation is a
birthday gift. October 24th was his
anniversary day and he intended the
magniﬁcent gift. to Carnegie “Tech”
in commemoration of the event.

Announcement of Mr. Carnegie’s gen-
eroustcontribution was made by VV. N.
Frew, following a meeting of the Car-
negie Technical Schools committee held
in Mr. Frew’s office in the Frick build-
ing. ~

CO-O'PERATION B E T W E E N
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
AND SCHOOL OF ‘ECO-
NOMICS.

At the last regular meeting of the
Chamber of Commerce, the following
recommendations made by the com-
mittee on foreign relations and com-
merce were adopted:

That the Chamber of Commerce
formally recognize that in the School
of Economics of the University of
Pittsburgh, the chamber has a most
effective co-operative agency for for-

matters of trade extension as well as
in sociological and economic better-
-ment in our community-V I
That the Chamber of Commerce
seeks to make known to the people
of the Pittsburg district the work the
School of Economics is doing in pre-

and service in the world of affairs
both at home and abroad.

SCHOOL OF MEDICINE

Pennsylvania Hall Now Being Oc-
cupied by Medical Students.
Moving Started Monday.

,The medical school of the University
is at last quartered in Pennsylvania
Hall, their new home on the campus
Classes were started Monday and from
this time on all the work will .be con-
ducted in the new building. The new
structure is one of the most complete
of its kind in the country, the facilities
for medical work being almot unsur-
passed.

SOPHS HOLD POW-WOW. I

The Sophomores met in executive ses-
sion last Friday morning, and while no
facts were given for the press, it is said
that the result of the meeting forebodes
evil for those gentlemen who are in
the habit of forgetting to wear their
green caps. '

‘FRESH TO HOLD BANQUET.

It is learned that the Freshmen are to
hold a banquet in the very near. future.
A committee has been appointed for the
conduct of the dinner, the date of which
is not for general knowledge, according
to the Freshmen reporter.

IN FINAL BATTLE

(Continued from page one.)

real basis for a true comparison. Pitt
is ready for the fray and with the
preparation comes the feeling that we
are going to win the annual contest,
all other opinions to the contrary.

State is planning to bring a large
delegation to Pittsburgh to root for
the team, which means that we must
muster our entire force to
the State men. The cheering and the
singing on Thanksgiving Day ought
to be the best-inthe history of our
football teams——sure'ly we have some-
thing to be thankful for this year and
even if the unexpected should happen,
let us shout as never before.

It is our team that is going to beat
State, if we are there to cheer, and
cheer we are going‘ to do. ‘

The State players will arrive in
town tonight and during their stay in
the city will bequartered at the Fort
Pitt Hotel. After the game the elec-
tion of a captain and the annual ban-
quet will be held. The Staterooters
and band will occupy sections one and
two in the grandstand tomorrow aft-
ernoon, ‘directly opposite the Pitts-
burgh contingent- I

The Pittsburgh rooters will meet at
Thaw Hall tomorrow afternoon and
march to Forbes Field in a body,
headed by Nirella’s band.

DEBATING TO _
‘ BE ENCOURAGED.

1

Meeting to Promote the Interest in
Debating is Held.

A meeting ‘under’ the direction of
Professor Fish was held last Wednes-
day morning for the ‘purpose of or-
ganizing a debating society in the
University- A large number of stu-
dents atten-ded the meeting and from
the spirit displayed it is likely the
debating club will be a very live af-
fair this year. This is a matter which
has been formerly neglected by the
students, but is worthy of greater
consideration than any other student
activity.

CHORUS IS ORGANIZED-

Mixed‘Chorus is Preparing a Num-
ber of Songs for Concert Work.

A mixed chorus under the direc-
tion "of Professor Berger has been
formed to promote interest in sing-
ing at the Univer-sity. The ﬁrst pub-
lic appearance of the new band of
singers occurred this morning in
chapel, where a program was ren-
dered. The work should attract many
who are interested in the Studv of
music. -

Tickets for the concert’ tomorroiiv
night may be obtained from the mem-
bers of the glee or mandolin clubs at thr
regular rate which is beinrr charged for

Plan to Gaze at Stars

Astronomical Society is To Be
Organized in Pittsburgh Under
Auspices of University.

It is proposed to establish in Pitts-
burgh _an astronomical society for the
beneﬁt of those who are interested in

 

' astronomy without necessarily having

a technical knowledge of it. For this
purpose the Allegheny observatory is
willing to offer the‘ society facilities
for headquarters, to loan such of its
books as can be spared from its li-
brary, and to give the members fre-
quent access to the public telescope
and lectures. In addition it may be
arranged to keep owners of small tel-
escopes informed with regard to inter-
esting occurrences. in the sky, such
as the location of comets, etc.

A meeting for the purpose of or-
ganizing the societviwas held at the
observatory, Riverview Park, Alle-

gheny, on the evening of Wednesday,

November 16th.

MUSICAL CLUBS ARE DENIED.

’. W. and J. -Faculty Refuses to Permit

Trips.

 Students at Washington and Jeffer-

son are greatly aroused over the re-

cent action of the faculty in refusing

the glee and mandolin clubs the priv-
ilege to make trips away from Wash-
ington. The action, it is said, is based
on the conduct of a few members of
the club while on a trip last year
when some things not verv creditable
to the college were allowed to trans-
pire. The opinion of the facultv seems
to be a little too harsh; give the men

a chance appears better.

SALE IS HEAVY.
The sale of seats for the game to-

- rnforrow has been the heaviest in the

history of the University, and it is like-

I 1y that the crowd will be the largest
I ‘witnessing ‘a game for many years. The
' Stated rooters have been allotted the sec-

tions opposite the University men, and
if the reports from State can be accept-
ed as a criterion, the cheering will be
very strong at the game tomorrow. As
was mentioned in a recent issue of the
weekly, it is the intention of the Blue
and the White to bring one thousand
undergraduates to Pittsburgh.

MASS MEETING THIS_
AFTERNOON THAW HALL

This afternoon on the steps of
Thaw Hall the mass meeting pre-
paratory to the game tomorrow will
be held- Songs and cheers will be
rehearsed for the occasion. It is the
duty of all students to be there. The
meeting is called for 3:30. We are
going to beat State. Are you on?

A CHEERFUL TALE.

A rumor has been heard recently
which indicates the possible erection
of two new buildings onlthe campus
by next commencement time. These
tales are by no means official and
we do not cite them as such, but it is
hoped such may be the case.

THE PITT WEEKLY

A BUSY MAN.

Tex. is Very Industrious in the Sale
of ‘Postcards.

Captain Richards is the busiest man
in the University these days, and it
all comes about through the post-
card business. These fads, you know,
are certainly very annoying when a
man must be kept at work all the
time trying to supply the demand of
the people. The cards, which Tex. is
selling, are very ﬁne and every stu-

dent ought to have one dozen in his

possession.

INVITATION IS NEAT.

Card Gotten Out by the School of‘

Pharmacy is Clever Piece
of Work.

The invitations which were gotten
out for the dance given by the School
of Pharmacy were decidedly unique
in character, in that they were ar-
ranged in' the form of a regular pre-
scription blank with the words writ-
ten in Latin. The Weekly acknowl-
edges the favor of the committee in
charge.

MARRIED.

Cole-Young.

Last Wednesday the marriage of
VValter Ray Cole, ’l0, and Miss Lucy
Young was solemnized in New
Castle, Pa. The groom is remem-
bered as the jovial King Cole of 1910
and was the most unlikely of the last
graduating class to fall before the
wiles of the little god. Immediately
after the ceremony Mr. and Mrs.
Cole left for a trip extending to sev-
eral of the Great Lake cities. '

ESPERANTO IS EXPOUNDED.

Disciples of the New Language Tell
‘ of its Wonders.

Last ‘Friday morning the students

listened with great interest to Messrs. -

J. "D. Hailman and John M. Clifford,
who essayed to interpret the possi-
bilities of the much talked of Esper-
anto. The géntlemen said a lot of
glowing things about the ‘language.
but it is not likely the tongue will be
included in the University’s curricu-
lum for the next term as a result of
the lectures of last week.

“TEX.” IN GAME.

Captain Richard’s injured leg has
fully recovered and the star Varsity
plunger will be found smashing the
State line tomorrow afternoon.

George M. Kirk was the leader of

Professor of Chemistry Reads Paper
Before the American Chemical

At the regular meeting of the Amer-
ican Chemical Society held last Thurs-
day evening in the rooms of the Ger-

man Club in Craft avenue, a paper of .

interest was read by Professor Sil-
verman on the topic, “Depression of

the Freezing Point by Vinegars. The
otherpaper of the evening was by

Mr. E. Blough, of the Aluminum
Company of America. Aside from
the meeting a dinner was served to
the members of the club and their
friends.

DEANS TO BE NOTIFIED.

Attention is called to thefollowing
regulation pertaining to the election
of studies which appears in the Uni-
versity catalog: “Choice of electives
for any term must be placed in the
hands of the dean of the school in.
which the student is registered, in

writing, not less than three weeks be-

fore the end of the preceding term.”
As the end of the term is rapidly ap-
proaching it might be well to make
note of the provision.

DANCE IS SUCCESSFUL.

The dance given by the School of

ments is to be congratulated.

PROGRAM FOR DAY.
The class in C. E. 19 will have the
following program today:

Musical Clubs of the University and
State College Men to Play.

The musical clubs of the University
and a contingent of State College
men will give the first concert of the
University season in Memorial Hall
Thursday evening after the State
game. The concert will be followed
by a dance, the tickets for admission
being available only through the mem-
bers of the clubs. The success of
the affair is’ dependent upon ‘the at-
tendance of the students, which it is
hoped will be large.

TWO-D_AY RECESS IS GRANTED

Sessions in the University Will Not
Begin Until Monday Morning.

Following the usual custom the
regular Thanksgiving holiday has
been granted the students which
means that no sessions of the Uni-
versity will be held until next Mon--A

sumed according to schedule. Many
of the out—of—town students are going
home for the annual turkey feast and
reunion.
