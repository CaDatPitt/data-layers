TUSDAY, MA 25, 1948

Pitt’s Delta chapter of Druids has been reactivated.

Probationary recognition was granted to a committee to reactivate Dru.id.<. at a meet-

ing last week of the Men’s Fraternity Coinniittee.

The local chapter of the honor-
ary scholastic and activities fra-
ternity for sophomore and junior
men went inactive in April 1946
after . an investigation revealed
that the organization had become
a political football.

‘Heading the new committee to
reactivate Druids are Bill Raines
and Mort Lerner, both former
members of the activities honor-
ary. , ‘ '

Under a new. constitution draft-
ed by Lerner and Raines, mem-
bership will be _accorded on the
basis of activities participation and
a basic requirement of a 1.75
quality point average. Strict new
provisions of_ the Druid constitu-
tion are designed to assure fair
elections, and tapping on a basis

Due to the late time of the pres-
ent semester, Druids will not hold
their first tapping until next fall.

The committee of former mem-
bers of Druids will be aided in the
reorganization by Dr. John Max-
well Ferguson, former advisor to
Druids and a committee represent-

tee and the office of the Dean of
Men. ‘

Queen Crowned In
Regal Color June 8

By Pat Seger

Queen Elect Corinne Nelan, accompanied by her court of
senior women, will enter the _Commons Room in a regal pro-
cession on the afternoon of June 8 to receive her crown from
the hands of Pitt Alma Mater, Mary Jane Mitchell Page.

The coro11ation.cere1non_v, akin to the eleven-century old
rite of English Monarchs, marks the apex of the life of Pitt

women.

This ritual, by far the most
beautiful traditional event in the
life of Pitt women, is actually
more than the mere crowning of
one person as queen. It is a-public
commemoration of the achieve-
ments of the senior women.

The chief. ﬁgureheads in the
ceremony, Queen Nelan and Alma
Mater Page, reign at the invita-
tion of the senior women who
named them as the class choice
at elections held early in the
spring.

In choosing one girl to receive
the official crown, the class not
only honors‘ her as a person, but
also honors in‘ her all their own
personal attainments. J

-Preparation for this event is
handled by the Traditions com-
mittee of WSGA. Jean Elliott is
the newly appointed committee
chairman. According to estima-
tions of former chairmen, time
consumed preparatory to the
crowning is easily the equivalent
of 100 women working forty hours
for one week, or 4,000 woman
hours of labor.

Smorgasbord for All
Alumni Homecoming week, with its smor-

gasbord specialty, tops the year for Pitt re-

cent and past graduates. The affair looks like

a big time. It merits the consideration of all
alumni.

The affair is the productof considerable-

effort on the part of Clyde Barton, secretary
of the General Alumni Association. This man
ha.s tried, for the past few years, to consoli-
date the work and ideas of the alumni all over
this fair la11d. Barton looks for a large turn-
out for his affairs and this affair, in particular.

Too often, Pitt alumni take the course of
“do‘ nothing - - say much” in their relations
with the University. \Ve felt this lack in the
recent football investigations, in the quest for

funds for the Student Union, in a hundred ,oth- '

er ways. This lack of active interest is a relic
of a past age. It shows the way of thinking
of the “practically-educated man.”

Barton has tried to overcome this. To a
great extent he is accomplishing his task. The
rolls of the Association and the “Giving Fund”
increase with each printing of the Alumni
News. Barton deserves a pat on the back. More,
he deserves the serious attention of each alum-
nus when he asks for support.

T00 New Maybe

‘' Something Went wrong. The Pitt Chest
Drive-ﬂopped. The drive actually netted about
one-third of its goal. As a consequence, if it is
to continue as a going institution, there ’ll have
to be some changes made.

VVe don ’t think that Pitt students are nig-
garjdly when it comes to ‘generosity. It’s just
possible, however, that the Pittites were not
made aware of the need for their generosity at
this time. We believe that the drive~failed be-
cause the organization back of it was not as
complete as it should have been.

The ‘fault, however, wefeel does not lie
with the sponsoring committee. _Rather,- the
committee did its best to put the drive across
successfully. Time worked against them. The
whole project was too rushed to enable it to

‘receive the planning necessary to make it a

success. Publicity for the drive was too meager,
instructors too eager tospeed the solicitors on
their respective ways so that class would not
be unduly disturbed. — ‘

The planning which has already started
‘under the direction of Abby Clark for next
year’s Pitt Chest Drive is a good indication

that the all important changes are being made.

Next year’s drive, we’ll wager, will be the
success that a project of this sort ought to be.

By Bill \,/eenis

Missing from the inner pages of the Pitt News
Tap Day edition was the listing of qualiﬁcations of
ﬁve publications appointees. This omission was not
an accident. Some people might think that these
men don’t; deserve to be placed with the immortal
tappees. Some people might, but we don’t.

The reason for the deletion is that we think
these people, who will weather the storms of
printers, deans, faculty, and students next
year, deserve a‘ niche -for themselves. They
have a‘ damn tough job to do.

First of these ﬁve men named -is a little guy
who has been kicking ‘around the eighth ﬂoor for
many years. Lee Karageorge takes over the Owl
editorship for next year and hasa lousy job to do.
Lee m.ust carry on in the footsteps of Walt Thomp-
son, a task in itself. He has a record to prove that
he is capable of doing-it;

The Karageorge side-kick is appointed Bus-
iness Manager Roy Barnes. This man has two
chief attributes in the drummer ﬁeld. The ﬁrst
centers around his ability to handle the stick
and skins for Bob Arthur’s marching and con-
cert bands. The second deals with his ability to
drum up ads for the Owl.

Johnny Schnapp takes over the reins of the
Panther from T. A. (Mr.- Alpha Sigma Sigma, him-
self) Perkinson. Johnny has a two year record with
the Panther in the Sports Editor spot. ‘The other
side of the staff ﬁnds a gaping hole to be ﬁlled by
the Publications Board sometime next month.

The third and last publication ﬁnds Ivan
Novick handling the business of our $20,000
per year baby, the Pitt News, Ivan’s chief
claim to fame, so he says, is astint in the ser-
vice as publications oﬁicer. He’s put in a year
with the News on the ad staff, too. ’ ‘

Last man on this totem pole is Don McCormack,
editor of the News, who answers to the call “Tally-
ho," from an old English joke of the same name.
Don has himself a task; he has a good staff com-
ing up; he should make the gradeiby alwide mar-
gin. The kid ‘has-more newspaper blood in him
than anyone of us up here. ‘ V -

He, along with the other poor fools who call

publications home, has a wish of good luck from
me. '

It has been impossible to mention favorably
many deserving people in the University athletic
world. Although I am,/gicertain they will continue
to excel despite any slights by this columnist, I
would like to comment on one man who has
done much to advance the prestige of Pitt.

He is Frank Carver, the director of athletic
publicity, who stays in the background and per-
forms his duties so expertly that ‘far too many
people are completely unaware of his capabilities.

Among the downtown sportswriters and our
own News sports staff, Carver  the most re-
spected and admired man in the athletic ad-
ministration.

He supplements his publicity activities by hand-
ling arrangements for swimming and track meets,
shepherds the baseball team through an abbreviat-
ed schedule, and supervises the press box during
basketball and football seasons. _

He is motivated’ in” all his work by a sincere
loyalty to the University. Publicity favorable to
Pitt, I wouldisay, is. mainly due to his efforts. The

irst, let us tell you who we are. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Beane are

tors of security issues.

We think it’s pretty important what people do with the money they save—-
so important that the job of helping them with their investments should be
handled only by men who are equipped for that work by character, intelligence,
and thorough training. The same holds true for men who help move our great
commodity crops to market. For qualiﬁed young men, we think there’s a real

opportunity in thejnvestment and commodity business.

Three years ago, we organized the ﬁrsticlass in the Merrill Lynch Training
School for approximately 30 carefully selectedxyoung men. We hired them to go
to school under top-ﬂight teachers for six months. Then they took jobs in various

of our 97 branch offices, most of them in or near their old home towns.

The Training School was a success. Six classes have now graduated, and a
seventh is in session. Almost 200 men (and two women) have completed the
course, and almost uniformly they have rolled up excellent selling records. .

Some of them have already advanced in the home or ﬁeld offices.

Because they have made good, we are organizing an Eighth

Training School Class.

In this class, beginning August 2 in New York City, we will give

* the course to the 35 best men (or women) we can ﬁnd.

These people will be paid while they learn. The rates of pay are

varied on the basis of marital status and working (or military)
experience. (Average for current class: $270 per month). -

On successful completion of the course, each of these people

will have a good job and, we hope, a good future.

If you would like to be considered for admission to this course, we obviously
have to know a good deal about you. For instance, as a starter, we want the fol-

lowing information: ~ . '

1.

Name, address, age, marital status

. Experience, working and military

3.

If you would like to apply formally for admission to the Eighth Merrill
Lynch Training School Class, write down the answers to these questions, plus any-_
thing else you’d like to tell us about yourself, and bring them to me or mail

The six weeks intensive train-

Track Team Travels

To |C4A's on Friday

A select group of Panther track and ﬁeld stars compete Fri-
day and Saturday in the IC4A championships at Randa11’s Island,

N. Y.

Among those expected to represent Pitt are Herb Douglas, 100-

yard dash and broad jump; Bill

Morton, 220-yard dash; Clarence

Doak, 220—yard low hurdles and quarter—mile; Bill Raney, high
hurdles; Dave Christopher, shot put and discus; and Chuck Thomas

and Pat Griﬂin in the javelin.

Last year, Doak and Douglas ﬁnished second in their top events,

the low hurdles and broad jump,¢

respectively.

Following the IC4As, the next
scheduled event for the team is
the National Collegiate meet at
Minneapolis, June 18 and 19. If
any Panthers qualify for the
Olympic tryouts, they will be at
Evanston, Ill., ‘July 9 and 10.

Lose to Miami

Injuries sustained by Herb
"Douglas in the 73-58 loss to Mi-
ami, Saturday at the Stadium,
may prevent his competing in the

,”1C4A broad‘ jump this weekend. A

pulled leg muscle may hinder his
Olympic chances as well, depend-
ing on recovery. «

One bright showing in the Mi-

ami, meet was Ed Sudzina’s con-
tinued rapid improvement in the
two-mile run. His time of 9251.1
was his best this year as he led
highly touted Mike Stavole to the
wire.

Reliable Clarence Doak ﬁnished
his college career unbeaten in dual
meet low hurdles, and ﬁnished the
season undefeated in the quarter-
mile. He also ran a leg on the un-
beaten mile relay team ,which has
taken this event in the \season’s
ﬁve duals.

Pat Griffin took the Panthers’
only ﬁrst in the ﬁeld events when
he propelled the javelin 171 feet,
ﬁve inches. Paul Goodwin and
Dave Christopher eachscored in
"two ﬁeld events. ‘

Minor Sports
Squads Finish
Poor Seasons

At Shannopin Thursday, Pitt’s
golf team closed its season by
dropping a 5 lé -3 1/2 decision to

,West Virginia.

The defeat by the Mountaineers
was number six’, as against only
two Panther victories. It marked
West Virginia’s second triumph of
the Spring over the Pitt linksmen.

In Thursday’s match, Mike Krak
and Bob Coulson ﬁred 73’s for the
Morgantown squad.

Competition in another sport,
tennis, will be concluded tomor-
row, as Pitt engages Allegheny
College at Meadville.

Should the Panther netters top
Allegheny, their record would
stand at three wins and four loss-
esfor the campaign.

On May 15, W 8: J handed Pitt
its fourth defeat, 6-2, on the
Prexies’ home courts. Three days
later, the Panthers bounced back
to upset West Virginia, 6-3, at
the Arsenal courts.

The double header comes after
a layoff of more than two weeks
for Mitterling’s crew. Such a lapse
often blunts whatever degree of
sharpness a team has.

Nevertheless, the Panthers are
extremely anxious to add a pair of
wins to their present record of
three wins and six losses, and
write into the 1948 books a re-
spectable account.
