celebrates 40 years

, Megan Kelly
For The Pitt News

Last night, about 30 “studen ’_’ took
over the University’s main computer
center and demanded equal civil
rights from the chancellor.

These “students” were actually a
group of actors from the Kuntu Rep-
ertory Theatre. They re—enacted an
event that took place onjan. 15, 1969,
that led to the founding of the Afri-
cana Studies Department.

. The real event, which took place
about 40 years ago, involved black
students barricading themselves in
the University’s computer center for
just more than seven hours. At the
time, there were 48 black students
on campus. The students demanded
more scholarships and ﬁnancial aid
for black students, as well as the es-
tablishment of a department where
students could learn more about their
heritage.

Chancellorwesley Posvar negoti-
ated with the students, which led to

the creation of Pitt’s Africana Studies S

Department. V

Last night, the department held a
celebration in the William Pitt Union’s
Lower Lounge to celebrate the 40th
anniversary of its unique and note-
worthy beginning.

The celebration featured the re-
enactment of the computer‘ center
takeover. Vemell Lillie, a professor
emeritus for the department, orga-
nized the re-enactment. -The Hillman
Library currently displays pictures
and articles from the original take-
over. '

Professor Oronde Sharif and his
dance troupe performed atraditional
African dance, and two faculty mem-

bers gave tribute to recently deceased
South African poet and former de-
partment chair, Dennis Brutus.

Brutus is best known for his time
in prison alongside Nelson Mandela
in the ’60s —— he emerged from the
experience with a collection of poems
he smuggled from prison on pieces of
toilet paper. He also worked in South
Africa to boycott sports that did not
allow minorities to participate, and
he later became the chair of Pitt’s Af-
ricana Studies Department.

Not to be confused with the Af-
rican studies department, which fo-
cuses speciﬁcally on the continent
of Africa, Africana studies is the
research of African-American, Af-
rican and Caribbean cultures. The
Africana Studies Department stresses
the idea that Africa is a major player
in the global market. It also deals

with areas such as history, intema— «

tional affairs and social work, and
all of these would be viable career
choices for someone qualiﬁed in the
department. The department also
offers drum and dance classes based
on the culture. There are about1,0oo
people enrolled in Africana Studies
classes this year. A

The rest of the department’s
history is also marked by success.
Professorjoseph Adjaye has won nu-
merous grants to run study abroad
programs in Ghana for Pittsburgh
public school teachers. Associate pro-
fessorjerome Taylor runs the Center
for Family Excellence, which helps
black farnillies in the Hill District,
and Professor Brenda Berrian has
won Rockefeller Fund Grants for her
research. M

Stephen Rapp discusses
human rights, wrongs

Richard Rosengarten

Stajfwriter 

For inspiration, Stephen Rapp
looks back about 65 years, to the
Nuremberg Trials.

He quotes former U.S. Supreme
Court Chiefjustice Robertjackson,
the man who helped lead the pros-
ecution of Nazis and other World
War II war criminals:

“The wrongs which we seek to
condemn and punish have been
so calculated, so malignant and so
devastating that civilization can-
not tolerate their being ignored,
because it cannot survive their be-
ing repeated.” '

Rapp, who spoke in the Teplitz
Memorial Courtroom of the law
school yesterday, has worked as
a prosecutor in numerous inter-

national courts and tribunals,"

achieving unprecedented con-
victions that recognized sexual
slavery and forced marriage as

crimes against humanity. He has 

also convicted people for the crime
of direct and public incitement to
commit genocide.

In September, Rapp became the
U.S. ambassador at—large for war

crimes issues, meaning he helps _,
bring alleged war criminals to trial.

His position, which was created by
the Clinton administration, exists

in few other governments.

So Rapp, who was appointed by I
President Barack Obama, works; 1

without appropriations, trying
when he can to marshal funds from
other organizations. ’

He spoke yesterday about the
role of the United States in interna-
tional criminal courts, which has
been complex and contentious.

“The idea of universal jurisdic-
tion is a_ controversial one,” Rapp
said.

International courts and tri-
bunals have sought to prosecute
people for crimes against human-
ity. There have been prosecutions
responding to conﬂicts in places
such as Rwanda, Sudan and the
Democratic Republic of the Con-
go.

The United States ratiﬁed a
treaty that created the Internation-
al Criminal Court in 2002, but later
“unsigned” it, relieving itself from
its commitment to refrain from
“acts which would defeat the object
and purpose” of the treaty.

It is one of only two countries
that has not ratiﬁed the U.N. Con-
vention on the Rights of the Child,
which was designed to protect chil-
dren’s rights. The other country is
Somalia, whose transitional gov-
ernment recently announced its
intent to become a member.

The United States has been cau-
tious of submitting to universal
standards of conduct, Rapp said.
The Bush administration adamant-

ly opposed involvement with the -

International Criminal Court.

Obama has adopted a more so-
licitous approach, but most policy
experts consider the United States-
far away from joining.

“I do not think we’ll see a presi-
dent in the foreseeable future sub-
mitting the treaty to the Senate for

Still, he said, the United States

ternational justice,.participating
in domestic debates on deﬁning

“If you remember the days of
the Bush administration, there
was the whole debate about ter-
rorism —— whether they should
be held incommunicado, whether
they’re people who should beneﬁt
from the Geneva Conventions or
whether they should be called un-
lawﬁil combatants,” Charlesjalloh,
a Pitt law professor who was born.
in Sierra Leone, said.

Jalloh invited Rapp to visit Pitt.
He met Rapp when they were on
opposing sides in the case against
former Liberian President Charles
Taylor, in the Special Court for Si-
erra Leone.Jalloh served as the de-
fense after Taylor ﬁred his counsel.
Rapp led the prosecution.

Rapp said he believes in the
power of international justice, but
that he wants to do more.

“People are not brought back,
and wounds are not healed by jus-
tice,” he said.

Rapp is busy extending his in-
ﬂuence.

After leaving Pittsburgh, he
will travel to New York to speak
at Pace Law School, hold meetings
on Rwanda and visit the Auschwitz
Institute for Peace and Reconcili-
ation. Later, he will stop in Tanza-
nia, Ethiopia and Baghdad.

He will be in Berlin by Feb. 16
for the Berlin Film Festival, where
he will host a reception, see a new
documentary about Nuremberg
and “shake down” the Russian
minister for funds for the Special
Court in Sierra Leone.

He said he hopes to be back in
the United States by Feb. 19.

Rapp said his goal is to make it
easier for individual countries to

crimes against humanity, making

Court is a last resort.

The international trials are

said, but they will only handle a

handful of cases.

“If it’s going to happen,” he
said, “it should happen in each

International courts can only
do so much. Rapp said his goal is
to make local systems more effec-
tive so that there’s a better chance
of justice at home.

[there was] a heavy thrust in the so-
cial’ sciences,” Berrian said. Berrian
pushed for more of an emphasis on
humanities, but because the’ depart-
ment has shrunk by 50 percent over
the years, she and her colleagues are
now tryingto balance the humanities
component.

Many of the audience members at
last night’s celebration were associat-
ed with the computer centertakeover
in19_69, and afew of them shed tears
at the end of the re-enactment. One of
the attendees who was indirectly in-
volved in the protest was Gwen Wat-
kins. Watkins, who initially worked
for the University as a secretary and
now works as a coordinator in the
Community Relations Ofﬁce, said she
doesn’t think she would have been
hired, were it not for the protest.

“I’m thanldiil for the courage of
the students to stand up for their
rights and equality. Without them,
none of us would be here,” she said.

Also in attendance at the event
was Gaﬂ Austin, who was involved
in the planning of the computer cen-
ter takeover when she was a student.
She left for a job interview during
the actual protest, but she wasvone
of the people responsible for com-
ing up with the clear and reasonable
demands the students presented to
Posvar that day. Austin believes the
University can still work on meeting
the demands students made about
40 years ago. '

“The University still needs to in-
crease the numbers ofblack students
and black professors,” she said.

Some Unconventional. Wisdom
Tea Parties lose grassroots appeal

Jacob Brown
Columnist

   

As atrue conservative, I have to admit
that I’ve been more excited about the
Tea Party movement over the last two
years thanl have been about anything
else in recent American politics.
Atlast, Ithought, herewas amove-
mentforaneveryday politico like me.
Iﬁnally hada place to turn that had its
interests in the U.S. Constitution and
individual liberties instead of partisan

, bickering.

In addition, the movement was
not; associated with special interest
groups, but instead with a bunch of

' Americans who had become disen-

franchised bybig government spend-
ing and the usual diatribe that spews

V ﬁ'om the mouths of politicians around

the country. It was truly a grassroots

movement. - 2
However, it now seems that some

‘of those special interests wantto crash

Accordingto Politico, shewillbe eam-
ing $100,000 for her time over the
weekend.

Tea Party Nation is a for-proﬁt
corporation run byjudson Phillips,
a Tennessee lawyer. His corporation
found several sponsorswho’ve pledged
$50,000 each to cover the costs, but
Freedomworks, one of the large-scale
organizers of the original Tea Party

movement won’t be one of them.

So what we have here is a bunch ,

of people with big wallets spending a
weekend with political hackastheyall

It sounds like every other Republican ‘

or Democratic convention.

While I’m sure it will give obnox-
ious leftists like Nancy Pelosi and
Harry Reid more fodder, I believe
this needs saying: This new direction
is to Tea Parties what New Coke was
to the carbonated beverage industry
in 1985.

Tea Parties have protested both
Republican and Democratic propos-
als. Lu Ann Busse, the head of Colo-
rado’s Tea Party brethren, called out

“Let it be known that we will not

cans abandoned conservative ideals
a long time ago. Steven Schier, a po-

Northfield, Minn., said to McClatchy

between Republicans and Democrats
is how they spend money -— not the
scale of it.

“With the Republicans, it’s defense.
With the Democrats, it’s education,
environment, health care, etc. That’s
been the major difference between
the two parties going back to Reagan,”
McClatchy said.

Fiefdom of Information

  

Dave Beitzel
Columnist

President Obama delivered his ﬁrst
State of the Union speech on Tuesday,
though it was his third address to a
joint session of Congress.

As I sat downtowatch, Iwondered
if he’d say the state of our union is
weak. I wondered ifNBC would move
the speechto midnight. Ialso sat down
ready for disappointmentinthe presi-
dent.

Obarna’s been gone. Don’t call it a
comeback, but the address had some
impact, especially if you’re a student
or jobless — ifthose terms aren’t syn-
onymous.

The State of the Union is built like
the Bill of Rights: The priorities come

ﬁrst. Which is why it was surprising...»

that it took him an hour to say all U.S.
combat troops will be out of Iraq by
September. It shows you how much
the U.S. populace cares about thatwar
right now.

The brief national security section
came long after sections on jobs, en-
ergy independence, higher education,
deﬁcit reduction and even renewed
bipartisanship. '

People don’t care about Osama

anymore. They want jobs.

College graduates are among those
most nervous about the j ob market. We
were told that we needed higher edu-
cation. And we were promised that, if
we got it, good jobs awaited. Yet, soon-
to—be alumni are now wondering if
their investment was worth it.

Debtthat soars inthe tens of thou-
sands of dollars is a massive burden.
Often, the cost is dismissed by older
Americans who say, “You’re young.
You have time.”Inourminds,we don’t.
Ask the crowd about to graduate in
the spring, and they’ll tell you tl1ey’re
worried. ‘ /

I’rn in that camp. Recently, I  I

talking to a relative who graduated
from college about seven years ago.
She said she felt bad for this year’s
batch of graduates. Though the job

~ market hasn’t been much better for
her, she said, “At least we had a feel-
ing of hope.”

The recession stole that from our
class.

Obama is tryinglto restore the
optimism graduates should hold, the
idea that the world is open and self-
ﬁrlﬁllment is possible. In his address,
he mentioned thatuiition has reached
“record highs.” Thankfully, Obama
called fora slew of new initiatives to

help students.

Ifsuidents can’t afford to pay for
college, some just don’t go, which re-
sults m a less educated populace —
not dumber, but certainly less doctors
and engineers. Other underprivileged

would-be students are forced to take .

out extra loans. That means more
debt, assuming banks will lend it to
begin with. Upon graduation, some
students have to take any job thatpays
the loan bills.

So itwas a relief to hear the presi-

denttalkaboutresolvingthis struggle. '

He said, “No one should go broke be-
cause they chose to go to college.” To
prevent bankruptcy or ruin, he pro-
posed ending tax subsidies to banks
that provide student loans. Instead, he
wantsto use that money fora$10,000
family tax credit toward four years

« of college. Even better, Obama sup-

ports loan-interestfbrgiveness, saying
students should only have to pay 10
percent of the total interest after 20
years and forgiveness after 10 years
if they go into public service.

Forthis governmental help, Obama
demanded that universities cut their
own costs, too. Hallelujah. Let’s'start
with textbooks. Get rid of them and
start issuing iPads. I’ll gladly spend
$500 on that instead of $500 per se-

mester on books.

These proposals are much more
alltuingthanhis campaign promise for
a$4,000 tuition creditinexchangefor
100 hours of community service. But
if he didn’t get that done — or much
else thatwas signiﬁcant—why should
we believe him now? The speech was
basicallya2008 campaign reclux, but
given after a year of little accomplish-
ment and shattered popularity.

We should trust and support him
now because the presidency needs
to be more than a whipping post.
Americans must do more than select
someone to blame for four years at a
time. Maybe it’s cathartic, but it’s not
constructive.

People, especially Democrats, are
mad at Obama because of an old les-
son from “The West Wmg.” It’s not
because he brokehis promises. Rather,
he made promises he couldn’t keep. It’s

the“deﬁcitoftrust”hespokeaboutin _
his address.

However, Obarna’s proposals for
college students are realistic. Unlike
endingpartisanship or massive indus-
try overhauls, tax credits and interest
forgiveness are tangible, attainable
goals. They are lush with long—term
beneﬁts with the addedvirtue of serv-
ing our self-interest.

Obama delivers sound educational proposals

The initiatives aren’t sexy, like a
cash-cow green economy orafomess
on Mars, but wonky efforts like them
will help millions of current and pro-
spective students. And a jobs bill, as
Obama demanded, should restore a
little of that old hope to graduates.

Obama spent almost as much time
talking about higher education as he
did national security. It showcases his
commitment. Now, students have to
meet him halfway by writing letters
to representatives and votingfor sup-
portive candidates. _

If students carmot rally around
the idea ofless debtgand lower tuition,
we cannot expect older Americans,
including the president, to continue
caring about skyrocketing university
expenses. ' ’

Lastweek, conservatives somehow

Lobster and steak dinners? TeaParties out of touch

Brown 4 3

of attending the traditionally presi-
dential candidate-saturated Conserva-
tive Political Action Conference taking
place Feb. 18-20 in Washington, DC‘,
she’s smartto skip it infavor ofthe Tea
Party Nation convention.

The Republican Party is stale.
However, not attending its event
doesn’t necessarily mean Palin’s a real
conservative.

Accordingto a Cato @ Liberty blog

entry posted byjeff Patch, her record
is spotty at best. Considering her re-
cord of leaving Wasilla, Alaska, $20
million in debtas mayor and beingfor
the $400 million “Bridgeto Nowhere”
before she was against it as Alaska’s
governor, I would have to agree. Al-
though I suppose sticking her in front
of a group of hberty-loving conser-
vatives instead of the normal, far-to-
the—right neocon crowd she usually

attracts couldbegoodforboth her and
the Tea Party movement, right‘?
Well, no. She “could potentially
harm the movement, because it’s a
premature national initiative that
doesn’thavethe supportofthe majori-
tyofwe the people,” Anthony Shreeve,
a former convention organizer, told
Politico.Aslongas she preaches about
religion’s place in her politics as it per-
tainsto the possibility oflimitingoth—

ers’ individual liberties, Palin has no
place in the movement.

Tea Parties have traditionally taken
place in front of government ofﬁce
buildings, atparks orinfront of monu-
ments. They’ve included people of all
ages, from senior citizens to young
children on the shoulders of their»
parents. .

They’ve been accessible to every- ,
one inthe past. But when they become

they’ve lost sight of their goal. -

I suppose I should have known a

Americans wouldn’t last forever. But
why must itsimminent demise come

Most daydream of wild ideas, but
not many follow through on them
like Point Park University students
Erin Kouwe andjami Shapiro.

Kouwe and Shapiro took their
“what if?” moment and transformed
it into a nonproﬁt organization called
the Threelo Moment and a dance
performance called “Inertia.”

With friends and roommates, the
girls came up with the Threelo Mo-
ment as a means to ﬁnd a way for all
forms of art to interact within the
Pittsburgh community. ‘

The name comes from Oct. 3 -
the date on which the girls decided
to make this happen — and the word
momentum.

The group settled on the idea

of staging a choreography festival. .

Any choreographer could apply, al-
though some were sent invitations.
After submitting applications and
videos, Threelo Moment-ended up
with the 10 choreographers they
have now. -

The group will put on its ﬁrst hour
and ahalf show, which consists of 10

short performances, lastingbetween
ﬁve and 12 minutes. The pieces vary,

- and each has a unique performance
and choreography to offer.

The high-energy show covers the
"spectrum of “where the dance indus-
try in Pittsburgh is going now.” Most
of the pieces have a contemporary

. feel, with the majority falling under

the jazz and modern dance umbrella,
yet they have something to please
even the most discerning.

Most remarkable is Heather
Ferri, who will perform a tap piece.
Ferri holds the Guinness record for
turning in tap shoes.

Bodiography will put on a con-
temporary ballet piece. Pillow Proj-
ect will premiere an innovative piece
called ‘jazz on the Radio,” a duet that
involves jazz dance and Radiohead
music.

The show has two student pieces,
but everything else comes from out-
side Point Park. Threelo Moment
hopes to establish more connections
between professionals and students
in the area. i .

Eddie Stockton, who also teaches
at the Ailey School in New York, and
Alison Seidenstricker, a Slippery
Rock alumna who has danced with
many New York dance companies,
have both choreographed pieces for
the program. ‘

Most choreographers brought
their own dancers, although audi-
tions were held for performers in the
Pittsburgh area. The show consists of
more than 70 dancers.

The program’s namesake, inertia,
“is the amount of force required to

produce movement,” Kouwe said.
“The idea [came] from Jamie and I
saying lets start something [that has
its] own experiment in inertia.”
Kouwe pulled the word inertia
from her background in physics. All
of the originators offered speciﬁc
areas of expertise to make the orga-

nization a reality, whether it was a.

background in marketing or sports
management.

' , The group has a good dynamic,

although it’s been a “major learning
process working with four friends
and remaining friends and living to-
gether all at the same time,” Kouwe
said. “We would love to see the pride
that Pittsburghers have for their
sports — Steelers, Penguins — and
see that come out in arts.”

Mary Muncil, director of market-
ing and development, agreed.

“Pittsburgh used to be a great arts
town,” she said, “and there’s a lot of
energy vibrating underground. We
want to bring that black and gold to
the arts scene.”

Threelo Moment has slowly’

generated funds from friends and

families. To help raise additional A

revenue, Kouwe and Shapiro held a

master class at Center Stage Dance '

Studio in Pittsburgh.

For those unable to get tickets
for “Inertia,” the run—through at
4:30 p.m. is open to the public for
a discounted price. Tickets for the
informal presentation cost $5 for stu-
dents, seniors and children and $10
for general admission. They can be

‘ reserved by calling (516) 286-0188

or by e-mailing info@three1omo-

ment.org.

Also, watch for the group’s next
show in March, called “Art of the Mo-
ment.” It will encompass the idea of
the creation of art in our time and
involve pieces based on improvisa-
tion. '

‘Inertia’ leapt to life from a mere daydream. ‘

The girls said they also hope to
incorporate more art media, such as
painting, into the performance. With
its strong choreographic pieces, this
ﬂedgling company should be well
on its way to helping Pittsburgh
strengthen its hold in the arts.

'’“"'‘’S by "“PP°°°"‘ brightest Star in soft rock

Philip Stevenson’ s Starless offers little enjoyment for listeners

Larissa Gula
Staff Writer

Philip Stevenson

Starless ’

Grade: C-

Record label: Night World

Sounds like: A deeper-voicedjesse
Malin C

It would be unfair to say an album called
Starless is as dark and depressing as a night
sky — it’s not quite that bleak.

But Philip Stevenson’s release is deﬁ-

V nitely not the brightest sky, either, so to

speak.
The ﬁrst track “Anatomy” opens with a

' smooth, soft rock feeling and an even softer

voice. Stevenson is barely distinguishable,
as he harmonizes with his guitar and loses

his vocals among the chords. .
In, the next track,_Stevenson follows a
similar pattern before ﬁnally slowing down

' from a rock guitar to an acoustic melody.

Titled “Fix Me,” there’s no saviorin sight.
Stevenson’s voice goes from harmonizing
to gravelly. L '

It’s not the music that’s bad. In fact,
if this review focused on the music, the
album would be much better overall. It
would be entirely comprised of a mixture
of soft rock to hard rock, frpm acoustic to
jazzy — an eclectic mix yet smooth and
refreshing product. '

The random 12-second jazz music inter-
vals inserted between three tracks would
sound ﬁne. Bad track titles like “I’m A Boy”
might even slide. ‘

But with a voice that is hardly remark-
able, very little supports Stevenson’s album

‘beyond some pleasant chords.

Techno band’s album
fails to come close  

Love Comes Close is no masterpiece from Cold Cave

Rocks like: The National
Grade: C+

c on

 

If you long for the days when Morrissey and
Robert Smith were cool and black, swishy
bangs were all the rage, then get ready to
dust off your eyeliner and\red lipstick and
give the latest release, Love Come Close,
from techno band Cold Cave a listen.

If none of the above appeals to you,
don’t bother.
Cold Cave, the brainchild of former

, hardcore rocker Wesley Eisold, is a techno

pop group, reminiscent of ’8os bands such

as The Cure, Echo& the Bunnymen and .

the synth—heavy Human League — only
not as good. “

Twentyyears ago, Eisold and company
would have been called innovative for their

mix of synthesizers, guitar and percussion. -

Nowadays, Cold Cave leaves listeners with
nothing more than a headache similar to
one from radio feedback.

Maybe this is an exaggeration. Songs
where Eisold sings lead vocals are, for the
most part, not half bad. He has an interest-
ing voice, similar to Echo & the Bunnymen
frontman Ian McCulloch, especially on title
track “Love Comes Close.”

Unfortunately, most songs featuring
female vocalist Caralee -McElroy, such as '

the opening track “Cebe and Me,” sound

annoying, almost grating. Her voice isn’t C

bad, but synthesizers overshadow it.

The best songs sound the most basic,
such as “LoveComes Close” and “Heaven
Was Fu1l,” while the rest —— to the untrained
ear — «sounds like melodic static.

Though it has some high points, Love
Come Close does nothing more than remind

A listeners of music they like a lot more. .

‘Lost’ delivers high-quality TV  

Brimmixng with subplots, mythology and stellar writing, the show deserves thumbs in the air

Layton 4 5

“Lost” has become asurprising but overjoy-
ing cultural phenomenon. “Twin Peaks” has
nothing on this show.

Practically redeﬁning what it means to
be a watercooler show, every episode of

the series presents so many mind-bending_

questions —— not to mention serious acting

credibility and emotional investment -— that A

it’s impossible not to ﬁnd fellow “Lost”-
philes wherever you are and subsequently
debate about that giant foot statue for hours
on end.

To try to sum up the past ﬁve seasons
of the show to the unengrossed would be
like trying to thoroughly explain the study
of thermodynamics to someone who has
never taken a physics course —— that is to
say, impossible;

Sure, you could explain the basics and
skirt over the subplots and sub-subplots,
but then not only would the listener become
inevitably confused but would also miss all
of the inter—character drama that has little
to do with the mythology, but everything to
do with what makes the show great.

There are plenty-of you out there who
probably despise the show, and despise even
more hearing fans discuss it. Does a conver-

‘ sation about thejack-Kate-Sawyer relation-

ship make you want to go. into convulsions?
A theory about Daniel Faraday and his crazy
b*tch of a mother induce-vomiting? Well,
you are obviously not a “Lost” fan.

To you haters out there, I say give it a
try. Sure, you’re a little late in the game, but
everyone has to start somewhere. Awarning
though: It is imperative, if you are to pursue
the ﬁve—season undertaking of catching up
with the show, that you start with season
one. If you ignore this advice and try to start
mid-series, your brain might literally ex-
plode. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

With this being the ﬁnal season, the
producers have a monumental task ahead
of them. They must tie up the hundreds of

  ‘Second - half surge propels Panthers

After trailing by four at the half, the Pitt men’s basketball out—scored St. John’s 39-25 in the second half to pull out the win

at Ben Duignan

Staff Writer

A silent, sold out Petersen Events
Center watched as senior Jer-
maine Dixon limped off the court
and into the locker room with
the Pitt men’s basketball team
trailing St. John’s in the second
half.

The crowd didn’t stay quiet
for long.

Pitt (16—4, 6-2 Big East) over-
came poor shooting in the first
period and used a second half
rally to down St.john’s 63-53 last
night.

The Panthers out-scored the
Red Storm (12-8, 2-6 Big East) by
14 after Dixon injured his right
ankle three minutes into the sec-
ond period. The senior guard did
not return to the game. Dixon
missed the season’s eight games
ﬁgfter breaking his right foot this

summer.

Pitt struggled offensively for
the third consecutive game, but
a much—improved defensive ef-
fort in the second half helped
seal the win.

The Panthers held the Red
Storm to just 33 percent shoot-

ing from the ﬁeld, while allowing
just eight made ﬁeld goals on 30
attempts in the second half.

Pitt coach Jamie Dixon be-
lieved defense was the key to the
comeback.

“We forced 15 turnovers and
frustrated some of their drivers,”
Dixon said. “We made adjust-
ments at halftime that helped
us immensely.”

Pitt junior Brad Wanamaker,
who led the Panthers in scoring
with 16, agreed that improved
defense was the turning point in
the contest.

“We were more intense, more
on the same page out there de-
fensively,” Wanamaker said. “We
talked more, and as a result they
shot a bad percentage.”

Pitt trailed by four at the half,
after shooting just 30 percent
from the ﬁeld and scoring 24
points in the opening half, its
second lowest output in a half
this season.

Pitt’s shooting woes, however,
weren’t apparent at the free-
throw line, as it converted 21 of
its 24 attempts. ,

The home team picked up the
scoring in the second half, shoot-
ing 52 percent from the floor and

scoring 39 points to put the game
away.

Pitt won the game despite
being heavily out—rebounded
throughout the contest. St.john’s
held the 41-31 edge over the Pan-
thers,‘ including a 19-8 edge on
the offensive glass. It was only
second time this season Pitt has
been out-rebounded.

Wanamaker helped fuel the
second half rally, scoring 13 of

his 16 points in the ﬁnal half. .-

The junior also ﬁnished with six
assists.

Pitt junior forward Gary
McGhee added 10 for the Pan-
thers, a personal season—high in
Big East play. Sophomore guard
Ashton Gibbs also tallied 14.

With eight minutes to go in the
game, Wanamaker threw down a
furious dunk that sent the crowd
into a frenzy and put the Pan-
thers up by seven. ‘

.“I saw the open lane and got
the dunk,” Wanamaker said. “I
was trying to make a statement.

» Enough was enough. I wanted to

let them know we wanted to win
this game, and we did.”

The Panthers return to action
Sunday at 1 p.m. when they travel
to South Florida.

tional championship.

The streak is the second lon-/,
gest in women’s NCAA Division

_ 2001-2003.
The Huskies have the number ‘

scoring defense (44.0 points per
game) in the Big East. Their av-
erage margin of victory is 39.2

The next closest is Nebraska,

South Florida has never been much of a bas- ..

ketball powerhouse.

Sure, the Bulls have stolen games from 1

teams treating their trips to Tampa more like
a vacation than a road game. * ‘ ‘

But this year, the Bulls are an upset threat
to any team willing to relax on them, thanks
in part to their relatively unknown leading
scorer. ' 1 ’

Jones. Never heard ofhim? That’s a shame, but
l’llhelp with that. ' '
,_ Justthis pastweek, the 6-foot-4 junior put up

"”c;£ié;o‘r-we most absurd stat lines of the season.

The game itself, a109-105 overtimewinagainst
Providence, was afast-paced afl'air.Jones should
know, as he played all 45 minutes, scoring 46

7 points. That’s right, 46 points in 45 minutes,
and that’s including nine of the team’s 14 points

in overtime. .

Jones ﬁnished the night withlo rebounds,
eight assists and three steals. »

Big East fans, and teams should get used to
this from Jones. He consistently puts up ex-
traordinary numbers against good Big East
teams.

Just this season Jones had a three-game‘

stretch where he scored 26 points against Notre
Dame, 30 points against Syracuse and 28 points
against West Virginia. 5'

He already has NBA analysts and scouts
praising him. Not only can he score — he av-
erages exactly 21 points per game on the year
—— but he also averages 4.4 assists per game.

the ﬁnal weeks of the regular season. -

Quick Hits: ,

“Final Destination” has nothing on the
r0ller—coaster season Connecticut is having.
The loss of coachJim Calhoun because of health
issues, coupled with athree-game losing streak,
seemed to decimate the team. Then the Huskies
regained their footing with a 75-59 win against
St.John’s. After that, all they did was go and
beat No. 1 Texas'88-74. Merely four days later
on Wednesday, Connecticut lost to Providence
by 15 points (81-66). It’s really hard to ﬁgure
out this team.

Syracuse improved to 20-1 overall and 7-1
in the Big East, extending the Orange’s streak
of consecutive 20-win seasons to 13 in a73-56
win over Georgetown last Monday. Moreover, it
is the 32nd 20-win season in 34 years for head
coachjim Boeheim, who moved ahead of Con-
necticut’sJim Calhoun for sixth on the all-time
Division I wins chart with his 819th victory.

Speaking of Syracuse, therewas a great story
on Orange sophomore Krisjoseph in the Wash-
ington" Post last week. The 6-foot—7 forward
lost 22 pounds over the summer while juggling
grueling workouts,strict dieting and attitude
adjustments. I don’t know about you, but my
summer involved none of those activities.

Big East Player of the Week:

Jerome Dyson, Connecticut — Dyson posted
a career-high 32 points in the win over Texas,

 East Team of the Week:

V, llanova — The Wildcats are quite simply

guard’-lScottie Reynolds scoring 18.7 points per
 and a team average of 85.2. Two easy
wins_.:over teams they were supposed to beat,
St. John’s and Notre Dame, shows this team is
motivated as well. The Wildcats are 19-1 for the
ﬁrst time ever. If you think they’re intimidating
now, just wait until March.

Big East Matchups to Watch:
No. 7 Duke vs. No. 11 Georgetown, Saturday:

’ Check this game out to get an early start on

scouting No. 1 seeds for your bracket come
March. Seriously, one of these two teams will
have a top seed, and we’ll look back on this
game as the divider. '
Louisville vs. No. 9 West Virginia, Saturday:
For two straight weeks, theMountaineers have
been on upset alert. This time it’s Louisville
coming to the Coliseum. The Cardinals have the
beef, with 6—foot—9 forward Sarnardo Samuels,
to rebound well against the Mountaineers. They
can also match West Virginia’s quickness in
the backcourt, and funny things seem to hap-

pen when the press is smothering opposing .

offenses.

'Who’s Hot:

Tim Abromaitis, Notre Dame — It turns
out people not named Harangody can score
for N otre Dame. Abromaitis has double-digit
point totals in six straight games, and he has
only scored in single digits twice all year. The
highlight was a 30-point, six—rebound game
against DePaul last Saturday.

Wh_o’s Cold: ’ '-

Rutgers — It seems that any second they’re
going to lose their coach, and who can blame
them? Coach Fred Hill’s team is terrible. They’re
15th in the Big East in rebounding and last in
turnovers (averaging 15.7 per game). It’s espe-
cially disheartening to Rutgers fans after the

— team improved last season andshowed hope

for this one. Now, Hill is raucously booed before
home games.

Panthers will try to limit turnovers

,.—_.

Connecticut < 10

nears double ﬁgures with 9.5

points per game.
13‘

When Connecticut played
then-No. 3 Notre Dame for the
ﬁrst women’s basketball College
GameDay event, the Huskies
dominated the Fighting Irish
70-46.

Earlier in the season, Connect-
icut played then-No. 2 Stanford
and won 80-68.

“It is almost a shame to wom-
en’s basketball that they do not
play in many competitive games,”
Stringer said. “[Connecticut coach

" Geno Auriemma] does not have to
bring the level of his team down,
but other teams have to be bet-
ter.”

Tomorrow, Pitt (12-7, 1-5 Big
East) will try to bethat team.

The Panthers earned their
first Big East win 72-58 over
Providence on Jan. 23, snapping
a ﬁve—game losing streak. * '

In the victory, the team found
the balanced scoring it had been

4

esensesaaaagnagngegaaaaaaaaaasaaaeaaaaaaaenaaaa

searching for since the begin-
ning of the Big East season.
Taneisha Harrison led the way
with 22 points, while Jania Sims
and Shayla Scott added 13 and 11
points, respectively.
Consequently, Harrison was
named to the Big East weekly
honor roll announced onjan. 25.
It was Harrison’s ﬁrst selection.
Besides leading the Panthers
against the Friars, Harrison
scored in double ﬁgures three
out of the last four games and
averaged 15.8 points during that
time. V
After Pitt’s 69-54 loss to West
Virginia onjan. 17, Sims said once
the Panthers get their ﬁrst victory
“there will be no lookingback.”
Unfortunately for’ the Pan-
thers, their ﬁrst Big East victory
came right before they face off
against basketball’s juggernaut.
If Pitt wants to put an end to
Connecticut’s winning streak,
they’ll have to ﬁnd a way to cure

a problem that plagued them
throughout their losing streak
and even in their victory over
Providence: turnovers.

Pitt has turned the ball over
118 times in the past six games,
averaging 18.8 turnovers per

_ contest.

Connecticut is third in the Big
East in turnover margin, turning
the ball over 7.67 times less than
their opponents. In contrast,
Pitt turns the ball over .47 times
more.

Pitt must work to limit Con-
necticut’s possessions — and the
amount of times the Huskies get
out in transition — by taking care
of the basketball.

It will be a battle of streaks
when Pitt and Connecticut tipoff
on Saturday. The Huskies will look
to add to their historic 59—game
win streak, while the Panthers
hope to build a win streak of two

skid even further behind them.
