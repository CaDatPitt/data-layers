Posvar Speaks, His Peace;

  Onlvliighty People i

A by SHERYLL ZIPPAY
Staff Coordinating Editor

(See editorial, pagefour and page 12forfurther information)
“I support "student power, if we define it as responsible
participation,” declared Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar at the

opening session of the Speak Your Peace Conference this past
Saturday.

Addressing a gathering of. approximately _50 students and
30 faculty members and administrators in the SU Ballroom the
Chancellor stressed that the University must play the role of
creative leadership both in short term active intervention and
long term research.

He spoke of student participation in affairs of the Univer-
sity and urged that the means of such participation not be con-
fused with the end goals.

“There are three elements of the University having special
interests,” the Chancellor said. “The first of these is the Board
of Trustees. The Trustees represent public interest in the insti-
tution and provide financial resources. They are not above criti-
cism and may deserve it, especially in recent years,” he added.

“The Trustees do not run the University,” _Posvar went on
to say. “They delegate the operation of the University, but they
require total information as to what is done,” he said.

The Chancellor stated the faculty as the second group of
special interests. “The faculty represent educational interests,”
he stated, “and maintain academic standards. They are the fin-
al authority on such standards and conserve and preserve the
values of scholarship,” he said.

“The. students represent their own interests as future use-
ful citizens ‘and have a natural innate concern for progress and
reform,-” he said.

“Administrators are concerned what their position should
be,” Posvarpointed out. “The administration should not have
interests of its own, but should serve the welfare of the institu-
tion as a whole,” he stated.

He went on to say that “theessence of the University is
the relation between faculty and students. When this relation-
ship is faulty, the institution breaks down. This is what hap-
pened at Columbia,” he added. -

“Many vital concerns of the students are at the level of the
individual school or department,” Posvar said. “I recognize the
existence of some University-wide problems such as commuter
parking, housing, fees, athletics, and I am committed to greater
participation and representation of students in these areas,” he
stressed. ~

“Using the context of the urban crisis,” Posvar stated, “We
should apply criteria of social relevance to the curriculum.”
He concluded by ‘declaring that “the University should not be
an obstacle to progress. When reformed, it can be the best in-
strument of progress.”

A coffee hour followed the Chancellor’s remarks and pro-
vided an opportunity for individual discussion between stu-
dents and faculty and administrators.

Group sessions centering on ten specific areas were then
offered in the Cathedral. Small core groups of faculty discussed
pertinent issues and problems with interested students. The
areas offered were social regulations, the commuter problem
and off-campus housing, language requirements, admissions
and counseling, the decision-making process, athletics, social
rules of fraternities and sororities, grades and teaching, the
role of Student Government, and academics. .

 

To unite the three unrelated
factions in our University-—the ad-
ministration, the faculty, and the
students — the SU Board has or-
ganized Project Thought, a series
of informal student—faculty for-
ums to held on Fridays at 7 p.m.

The unification of these fac-
tions is necessary “in order for
our University to grow academ-

ically and be regarded as a pro-

gressive institution of higher
,.lea\rning.” - iv  a . T

sity Provost; Dr. Jack B. Critchfield, Assistant Chancellor_:of_
Student Affairs; and Ken Schueler, president of Student Gov}
ernment, answered questions posed by the audience. in v» ‘

Schueler commented on the conception of many Univer-
sity students of fear and apprenhension toward “unapproach_-
able” persons (faculty and administrators). “The primary inten-
tion should be to reach understanding and to share ideas and
feelings without being caught up in the role situation,” he
stated. ‘ ‘

When asked about the proposals submitted by the Co 
mittee of Concerned Students, Peake stated that “everyone:in_
the administration intends to bring about rapid change.” He

negated. . '

The number of students present in proportion to the entire
student body was compared to the ratio of faculty members pre-
sent. “It shows that a lot of faculty have been thinking abo
student problems and are really interested," a member of the
audience noted. ‘ '  

The question of participation was attributed to apathy
and also to the institutionalization of the forum. Joe Kociubes
pointed out that the informal meetings of concerned students
gathered several hundred persons. ’

The major complaint of the students was that “everyone

some action‘? How long do we have to wait?” . ' '

The question of legitimacy of groups sponsoring ideas 
raised. Kociubes contended that the whole question of legitima-

nating from certain groups of people,” he declared.  _

 ge Want Priority

 

7 1,, _Many interesting developments came as a result of the
“Speak Your Peace” conference Saturday. The fact that the
faculty, administration and students had a chance to openly
‘discuss problems at the University was by far the most im-
portant development. As Dr. Critchfield noted in one of his
‘many answers to student questions, the conference was a be-
ginning—a step in the direction of student involvement. But
the conference also exposed the problems that must be en-
countered while the following steps are being taken.

; A consensus opinion seemed to indicate that the three
‘main steps to the ultimate goal of student rights are com-
inunication, representation, and action. The communication
is improving, but it has always been good. The administra-
tion has always listened to the problems of various student
groups, and although little or no action was taken, they have
responded. The faculty and administration seems to want
tocommunicate with the students as was evident when both
-factions were well represented at the conference.

The main problem of the student movement, in all three
steps, was exposed Saturday. There were a few hundred stu-
dents during the whole course of the day that cared enough

_Possibly those that didn’t come felt the conference wouldn’t
solve any of the problems. Possibly they had other things to
do that they considered more important. Possibly they just
didn’t give a damn about the quality of education they re-
s ceive here at the University. But the fact they weren’t there

portance to the whole subject of student rights.

The fact that many of the proposals students gave to the
administration and the faculty weren’t representative of the
entire student body, was used as an excuse by some admin-
istrators for not taking action on those proposals. But after
Saturday, it should be quite clear to all concerned that
representation can no longer be viewed in the same manner
as it has in the past. Student leaders should realize that if
the majority of students don’t care enough to initiate change,
then they won’t mind, or complain, or be concerned if
change is instituted. Administrators should realize that if
they wait for proposals to reach them that have the support
of the whole student body, then those proposals might be
similar to the ones of students at Columbia, Berkley, etc.

One of the students in the audience questioned the ab-

ball game at Syracuse) that received a higher priority than

student rights movement.

Although the administration has listened to the students
in the past, little action was taken because there were other
things that had a higher priority on the administrations long
list of daily actions. Many proposals have been shelved, lost,
, forgotten or just ignored. The fact that the proposals didn’t

represent the entire student body is a favorite excuse of

administration can’t be naive enough to think that because
the majority of students here don’t express their gripes they
don’t have problems; But they must feel this way, for Dr.
Critchfield frequently expressed his feelings that it is the
«responsibility of the interested students to get the others to

7 volved, and before the administration takes any action on
, student proposals, they will have to realize this fact.

bKS(:fc(i)£S'€d[;tI(E_S After getting into my apartment, I realized I

The clear, honest sounds of Simon and Garfunk-
el’s Sounds of Silence came across the car radio.
Ah, yes . . . suddenly I felt like Dustin Hoffman.

- The Graduate. Lucky Hoffman, the only problem

he had was Anne Bancroft. After he worked out that
problem, he was fine. But with me, the past two
weeks just do not seem real. It’s t_ that anything
little happened; rather it was lik I 
everything happened.

It all began on a chilly Frida
morn. After checking page proof
at the printer, I returned to m
car (which still hasn’t been re
paired from an accident at th
shore this summer) and found one
of those red tags which advises -
one to deposit a dollar in one of;
the little boxes in the lot because _ .
one’s car was parked five min-g
utes too long in one spot.  LIES ,

At the time, it was nothing. But it was the be-
ginning.

Then on another day, I left my apartment to
make a phone call. Naturally, as I closed the apart-
ment door, I remembered my key was inside the
room. That was nothing. To get a key, I went to the
landlady (who screamed that she does this at least
twice a day. We got in the elevator to go from the
first to the. second floor. The elevator door closed,

 

   
  
  
  

 

had lost my wallet. That wasn’t bad because I
found it in my car, but what was bad is that when
I got to The Pitt News office, I didn’t have my wal-
let. It was lost again.

That was the first week. Baby, the second week
was right behind it.

Last week, I got 50 per cent on an English lit
exam, failed to turn in an English article, skipped

a Spanish quiz and fell ‘behind in tow other courses. '

I learned I owe McGraw-Hill a few dollars, slept
through a noon class, and ran out of socks to wear.
I had to defrost a refrigerator, borrow $10, and lis-
ten to the second half of the Pitt game.

I thought I missed my mother’s birghday; so I
called to wish her happy birthday, and she said it
wasn’t her birthday.

I lost a buddy to matrimonial woes and flunked—
out on two consecutive Saturday nights (the past
one I still haven’t gotten over). '

There wasn’t a_ flood of letters or phone calls
from friends and well-wishers. There wasn’t a good
night’s sleep. And there wasn’t a place to hide, or
run away to.

It was two weeks that had to_be, and I guess two

Curfews: “V\7ho’hs Going To Take

by PEGGY ALLEN

The girls living in the dorms
should be grateful; their great
mother, the University, is watch-
ing out for all of them and pro-
tecting them from any evil. It’s
frightening to think that while
living away from their own
ho-mes and gr; -
mothers, , they
ma y have to
make some de-
cisions and _
tak e some 0
the responsibil
ity for thei
own lives. How
r e s u r i n g to .
know that the I
University will
do it for them.

Girls have curfews for their
own protection (who knows what
would happen to them if they
could chose their own hours). A
curfew violation is a very serious
offense they must be punished by
the University since it is, after
all, the University’s responsibil-
ity to make sure all the girls are
safely in bed on time. One such
violation was commited last week
by a girl in McCormick Hall. She
came in an hour and a half _after
curfew. This was a bad thing for

ALLEN

that they often stay awake past
midnight studying, or whatever.

I hope this incident will not be
repeated. If McCormick finds
that this hour will be necessary
again, I hope they will inform
their students, so we can prepare
for this unsightly soujourn.

her to do, but, being a student,
she did not have to take the re-
sponsibility for her own where-
abouts. The University did it for
her. Her senior assistant waited
up for her, and, when a room to
room search throughout the dorm

confirmed the fact that she real-

ly wasn’t there, the head resi-
dent was notified. The head resi-
dent, in turn, was forced to call
the girl’s parents, and, if the par-
ents had so decided, the Pitts’-
burgh Police and the Bureau of
Missing Persons would have then
been notified.

This girl (the criminal) was in-
vited to appear before the Judical
Board. This was only right and
proper since she did break the
rules and deserved to.be punish-
ed. But, again, the University
saved her from having to take too
much of the responsibility for
her punishment. She was not ex-
pected to face a real court of law,
where she would have been, al-
lowed to bring witnesses, some-
one to defend her, and have had
the opportunity to prepare her
case. Instead, she was allowed to
appear before a closed meeting
of the Judical Board.

“The girls on the Judical Board
were very kind to me,” she told

Care of Me When I Graduate”

the Pitt News, I guess they did-
n’t want to frighten me by treat-
ing me like an adult. They asked
me to tell them what happened,
and then began to question me-
‘Who were you with? . . . Have
you ever been out with this boy
before? . . . Where does he go to
school? . . . Did you double date?
. . . Who was the other girl? . . .
Where does she live? . . . Does
she go to school here? . . . Where
did you go, a party? . . . What’s
the name of the person who had
the party?’ . . .”

Isn’t it wonderful that the Uni-
versity is 'so concerned about the
welfare of the girls that it even
wants to know whom they date?
If this girl had been tried in a
real court of law, she would have
been judged only by whether or
not she broke the law. But, here,
Judicial Board even takes the

time to make sure the girls are,

leading a good, clean, moral life.
“I’ve learned my lesson,” ad-

mitted the girl. “I won’t break

curfew again. The administration

has too many other things to ‘wor-
ry about.”

“But,” she added, “one thing
is beginning to worry me. Who’s
going to take the responsibility
for my life after I graduate? . . .”

Major Richard Slife

“Citation, by direction of the
President, the Bronze Star Medal
is presented to Captain Richard
D. Slife, Corps of Engineers,
United States Army.” Slife, who is
now a Major, is assistant profes-
sor of military science at the Uni-
versity. He was presented this
high honor, for distinguishing
himself in connection with ground
operations in Vietnam.

Major Slife is a native of Pitts-
burgh and now lives in the Penn
Hills area with his “wife, one son
and one dog.” He graduated from
Carnegie - Mellon University in
1961 with a Bachelor of Science
degree in Civil Engineering. Af-
ter a year of service he found that
he liked the Army well enough to
make it his career.

In Vietnam, Major Slife, thena
Captain, was in charge as a batta-
lion maintenance officer. His

main responsibility was supply-

ing five companies. When Slife
was assigned to the battalion,
more than 25 per cent of all_ve-
hicles on the base would not run.
Within a period of about two and
one-half months Major Slife had
this reduced to only eight per
cent. Slife also had to build a
supply and equipment depot, and
even with a very small mainten-
ance unit and many adverse cir-
cumstances, he was able to com-
plete his mission quickly and- suc-
cessfully.

Slife received his officers com-
mission from Carnegie-Mellon, in
their ROTC program. He explain-
ed that when a young man comes

they can be for 1eadership’posi-
tions, but that they have a nine
month basic instructional course
that they take after they receive
their commissions, that “hones the
edge” on their ROTC training.
Slife explained that for a second
lieutenant, fresh out of basic train-
ing to go in and take over a pla-
toon, is just like going into any
new job, in that it takes a while
to get your feet on the ground.
But Slife feels that ROTC second
lieutenants are every bit as cap-
able as the West Point graduates.

In many cases they turn to George
Wallace w h o promises t h e m

problems.”

Kaufman predicted a major
change in local politics. “The ‘Old
Politics’ had its last gasp in Chi-
cago,” he commented. “If Wal-
lace shows his predicted strength
in t h e s e formerly Democratic
wards in this area, there will have
to be a rise of new leadership in
local politics. There may even be
a rise of political coalitions to
gather strength,” he added.

Representative Kaufman is cur-
rently seeking re—election his sec-
ond term. He noted that he had to
defeat the Democratic machine
in his District in the primary two
years ago in order to be elected.
He also mentioned that he was
the first elected official in Penn-
sylvania to support Eugene Mc-
Carthy. “Many of my fellow rep-
resentatives .in Harrisburg can’t
understand how I can be such _a
‘rebel.’ These people don’t under-
stand that an elected official must
be concerned with his constitu-
ents,” he concluded.

The Saigon government is still
far from offering equality of op-
portunity to poor Vietnamese in
the field of education.

Secondly, education i s. th e
means of moving into positions-of

responsibility, prestige and pow-.

er in the government, the mili-
tary and other spheres, and it has
traditionally been monopolized
by a privileged economic class.
One of the attractions of the Viet
Cong movement has been that it
has given poorer youths an oppor-

tunity for advancement which the’

legitimate social system denied
them.

The numbers of primary and
secondary students in South Viet-
nam have risen steadily over the
years. There are now almost five
times more primary school stu-
dents and more than six times
more secondary school students
than there were ten years ago. But
whereas primary school education

is now nearing the “saturation”
point of about 85 per cent of the
primary school — age population,
only about 15 to 20 per cent of the
secondary school age population
is being educated.

Furthermore, the growth in sec-
ondary education has been mostly
in private schools, which now ac-
count for two-thirds of all second-
ary school students. Public sec-
ondary schools have not grown
proportionately faster than private
schools. Only one village in five
has any public secondary school,
and most provinces have only one
public “high school.” Nine pro-
vinces have no high school at all.
A peasant family can-seldom af-
ford to' send its children to a pri-
vate school, or even a “semi-pub-
lic” school (which charges tui-
tions half those of private
schools).

Moreover, very few of those
who enter the first cycle of sec-
ondaryschool receive their bac-
calaureate, which is necessary for
prestige employment. Of the stu-
dents enrolled in secondary school
in region IV last year, only two
per cent were in the final grade.
Baccalaureates a r e in th e o r y
awarded only upon passing an ex-
amination, but according to one
educational adviser with long ex-
perience in Vietnam, they are
available to anyone with the mon-
ey to buy them.

lagued By Inequities

Saigon is not meeting the rising
demand for secondary education.
Last year, in the delta region,
which contains half the popula-
tion of South Vietnam, 41,413 stu-
dents sat for entrance into “sec—
ond cycle” of secondary school,
which corresponds to high school
in the U.S. education system. Of
these, only 9,285, or 22 per cent
of the total, were accepted.

There has been little change
in this percentage over the past
few years. In 1965 and 1966, 21
per cent of those who sat for the
examination were accepted. The
actual number of students accept-
ed into the secondary cycle last
year was less than it was in 1965.

In_ some provinces, the ratio of
those desiring secondary educa-
tion to those accepted is even
higher. In Tay Ninh province, ac-
cording to an American teaching
in the provincial high s c h 001 ,
there were 4,000 applying for the
school, but less than 400 were ac-
cepted.

' Most Americans in the field
agree that the Ministry of Educa-
tion has not really tried to provide
as much secondary education as
possible. An official source says
there have been pressures on the
Ministry of Education from the
U.S. mission to make more of an
effort in the area, but that Minis-

ter Nguyen Van Tho has not felt’

education is the best use of the
government’s resources.

Until now each province has
had to submit plans for secondary
school classroom construction to
the central government, and the
pace of construction has lagged.
Last year in the Delta region 48
classrooms were programmed by
the Minsistry of Education, but
none of them were even started.

This year, 77 classrooms have
been planned, and so far 19 are
either built or under construction.
According to a U.S. official, the
Ministry was reluctant to build.
that many classrooms, but was
overruled by the “Superministry”
for Revolutionary Development.

U.S.’ advisers in the field point
out that any great growth in high

school baccalaureates would mean _

tougher competition for middle-
and upper-class young people for
government and military. posi-
tions. “They don’t want the peas-
ants in on the action,” says one

province education adviser.

Another U. S. official believes
that the Saigon government has
feared the growing number of
well-educated youths without
jobs. This fear the U.S. mission
appears to have shared. In the
“Area Handbook for South Viet-
nam” issued to U.S. personnel last
year, it is noted that university
graduates who cannot find jobs
with the government are swelling
the numbers of an “intellectual
proletariat” which has been
“causing increased concern to the
government.” This is contrasted to
the situation in 1955, when the
government “had no particular
difficulty in placing the few hun-
dred graduates of the University
of Saigon.”

The same adviser notes, how-
ever, that there is another vested
interest in holding off on second-
ary education expansion. About
two-thirds of the 471,000 students
in secondary schools are in pri-
vate institutions, which are mon-
ey—making propositions. Those ed-
ucators who run them have little
interest in free public education,
since private school enrollments
may drop as public school enroll-
ments rise.

The reason cited by the Saigon
government for the slowness of
progress in secondary education
is the shortage of teachers.

Robbe-Grillet l\/Iocvie Peculiar

by‘ PAUL ANDERSON

Trans-Europ Express, now playing at the Squirrel Hill Theatre,
is one of the most peculiar movies I’ve seen in a long time. Written by
and co-starring the heady French novelist, Alain Robbe-Grillet (the
author of Last Year at Marienbad), the film hasa confusing experi-
mental aspect that had better be clarified before we proceed to what
you’ve all been waiting for, the sex-crime-sadism parts that the news-
paper ad promises you.

What Robbe-Grillet trys to do in Trans-Europ Express is present
us with a film in the raw: uncut and unedited’, flashed on the screen
the instant it is conceived. To achieve such an effect, Robbe-Grillet
integrates himself and two assistants discussing an idea for a film with
the actual acting out of the idea. This way, the film makers are con-
tinually stopping the action of the movie to ask Robbe-Grillet ques-
tions about ambiguous scenes or to edit‘ out the contradictory ones.

It seems as if Robbe-Grillet is poking fun at the critics of Last
Year at Marienbad who complained that the film didn’t make any
sense. In a typically high-handed sort of way the writer tells the phil-
istines to ignore certain scenes or, what’s more amusing, flatly con-
fesses that even he doesn’t know what’s going on sometimes.

This contextual confusion is consistent with Robbe-Grillet’s film
theory that a realistic movie, like the workings of the human mind,
must not follow a cause and effect course of action. Commenting upon
Marienbad Robbe-Grillet states that a film which follows a plot is
“novelized,” “old fashioned” and fails to produce the most convincing
effect, the effect of real life. To capture the stuff of reality, a film

must simultaneouly address the present, memory and the unconscious ,

to the viewer’s faculties of sight, hearing and feeling.

Robbe-Grillet says that if the spectator is willing to abandon his

“archaic” conceptions of time sequence and “let himself be carried ,

along by the images before him, by the actors’ voices, by the sound
track, by the music, by the rhythm of the cutting . . . to this viewer the
film will seem the easiest he has ever seen: a film directed exculsive—
ly towards his senses.” '

So much for film theory; now for the story: a gangster (Jean-Louis
Trintignant from A Man and A Woman) is hired by a gang to trans-
port a quantity of cocaine from Paris to Antwerp on the Trans-Europ
Express. Because he’s new at the job, the gang doesn’t trust him and
they subject the dope runnerto a series of ridiculous tests, rendezvous
with secret agents, sets of impossibly complicated instructionsto re-
member and a beautiful double agent (Marie—France Pisier) to resist.
Needless to say, he does everything except resist the beautiful spy
and that’s where the “erotic sadistic fantasies” promised in the news-
paper ad come in.

I hope eveyone detects an air of the simulacrum in this thing.
Here’s Robbe-Grillet explaining a film (something he said never
should be done) and a mystery, full of James Bondian cliches, of all

 

things. If you can get right in the swing of things at the beginning, 
that is, stop thinking lineally, everything falls out of place and you’re ’ '

left with a very funny confusing mystery farce.

  Stronger Orangemen Batter Panthers, 50- 1 '7 
Gridders Collapse in Second Half;

Havern Just Misses Pass Record

» by ROY JACOBS

Syracuse, N. Y. — a phy-
sical beating as well as grid-
iron lacing was‘ administered

‘ _ to the Panthers by Syracuse here

Saturday. The Orange caused as
many injuries as they scored
points in overwhelming the grid-
ders, 50-17.

“They just overpowered us in

the second half,” reflected head

coach___,Dave Hart, who saw an
abrupt”end come to his Panthers’
winning ways. “Look at them
physically, then look at us.
There’s no comparison.

“It was almost as if our offen-

sive line wasn’t there,’-’ he added.
“The combination of their pass
rush and our injuries just wilted

77

US.

Wilted seemed like a good
choice of words for Hart, because
the Panthers played top - notch
football throughout the first half,
only to have the offense fall apart
in the third period and the de-
fense come undone in the fourth.

At the close of the first half, the
Cats only trailed 24-17. Dave Hav-
ern had rallied the squad from a
17-0 deficit by firing touchdown
passes to Skip Orszulak (67 yards)
and George Medich (nine yards).
The defense came alive, too, in

Spéakout

50 Point Controversy:

Did Ben Roll It Up?

by Roy Jacobs
Sports Editor

The final score Saturday, 50-17, was both painful and
interesting. Anyone who paid careful attention to the game
knows that the score is not representative of the total game

. picture (although many of the players in the Syracuse locker

room would argue otherwise). It may have just been a case

of their second-stringers playing harder than the Panther-

Twenty-one of the Orange’s points were
scored in the fourth period. Coach Ben
Schwartzwalder’s team was passing until
the very end, looking for those extra scores.

Syracuse’s hustling for points makes one
recall some of the verbal darts Schwartz-
walder threw during a recent visit to Pitts-
, _ _ burgh. He questioned some of Dave Hart’s

"J  staff’s recruiting practices and warned that

second- iners.

...—-~- —g-—--.—......_,‘

     

 A; comes to Syracuse this year.
Through the first half Saturday, though, Schwartzwalder

‘ had his hands full with the Panthers. In the second half, the

Orange defense tightened and Syracuse had the game well
in hand. Still, they kept pushing, towards the Panther goal
line. Twice in the last five minutes Syracuse scored touch-
downs.

Was Schwartzwalder holding some sort of grudge against
Pitt? What was he trying to prove? Second team quarterback
Rich Panczyszyn admitted that the coach was calling all the
plays at the end.

_“We just wanted to show the people a few things,” said
Panczyszyn. “We wanted to show them we could pass.” With
the score 36-17 mid-way through the fourth quarter?

“We don’t hold any grudges,” said Schwartzwalder, dis-
missing any idea of a revenge motive. “We just like to beat
them'_,,real good.

“We just like to move the ball,” he added. “When we get
the football, we’re going to move it for 60 minutes. We have
second’ stringers, and we want them to learn to move it.”

Panther coach Hart concurred to a degree. He said,
“You don’t put your second team in so they can let up. They
are eager to show" what they can do.” But Hart sighed and
added that it seemed like other teams like to “stomp on us
when we’re down.”

Well, from here it didn’t seem like Schwartzwalder had
to “show the people a few things” as Panczyszyn put it.
The Homecoming crowd of 32,600 was in Archbold Stadium
for the whole 60 minutes, not just the fourth quarter.

The people in the stadium saw an even first held and
they saw the Syracuse offense thwarted in the third period,
too. The “people” Syracuse was interested in showing a few
things were the people who read or hear about the games and
vote in the national ranking polls.

Syracuse has an outstanding chance of going to a bowl
game this year. It doesn’t hurt any for a TV annoucer to say
on national TV, “. . . and Pittsburgh got bombed again, this
time by Syracuse, 50-17

The winner can be smug and complacent after a game.
He needn’t apologize for anything he did. It’s useless for the

’ loser to complain because nobody listens.

 

llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIllllllllllllllllllllllll

Pitt would have its hands full when it

the second period, stopping‘ the
Orange with just one first down
in the last 10 minutes of the quar-
ter.

“We played well enough in the
first half, especially in the second
period, to win,” remarked Hart.
“We played real fine football.”

Even Syracuse coach Ben
Schwartzwalder admitted that the
Panthers have him a hard time in

the first half. “Pitt has a real fine

offense,” he said, “and some good
players. That Havern’s a tough lit-
tle kid—he’s like an eelyout there.”

Actually, Havern was dropped
for losseslof 26 yards attempting
to pass, but his scrambling en-
abled him to pass for 343 yards
—two short of Bob Bestwick’s Pitt
record in 1951—on 21 completions
on 38 tosses. Havern now has 881
yards passing after four games,
ahead of the pace needed to break
Kenny Lucas’ 1965 record of 1,-
921 yards.

Still, Havern threw three cost-
ly interceptions. Two came at
crucial times. One halted the Pan-
ther’s opening drive at the Syra-
cuse 18. Nine plays later the
Orangemen went ahead, 7-0.

The second came when the
Panthers trailed 17-14 and drove
to midfield. Havern was rushed

hard and had to take a little off

his throw to George Medich. Sy-
racuse safety Cliff Ensley cut in
front of Medich and raced 53
yards with the interception for a
touchdown.

The third came midway through

'2 the third quarter when Havern

underthrew Skip’ Orszulark, but

it had little effect on the game’s ~

scoring.

What did have a great effect on
the game’s scoring was the phy-
sical beating the Panthers absorb-
ed. It rendered the offensive line
useless and the defensive line
helpless in the second half. Jeff
Barr led the Panthers in tackles, a
feat unusual for a member of the
secondary.

Hart was not very pleased with
the play of the defensive line and
the linebackers although Schwart-
walder did. admit Syracuse had
trouble coping with the new 5-3
alignment in the first half. '

More. than just the Panthers’
pride was hurt in Saturday’s
50-17 loss at Syracuse. Nearly
every player came away from the

game bruised in some way, and-

the squad agreed that Syracuse
was the hardest hitting team
they’ve faced all year.

“A lot of the injuries came
when our players got tired,” ana-
lyzed coach Dave Hart, “and
you’ve got to get tired when you
play Syracuse. You have to spell
everybody ‘a little ‘— give them a
chance to rest — but we’ couldn’
do that with everyone. '

Because of a lack of personnel,
several players played both ways.
“It’s not really fair to play a guy
both ways,” said Hart, “but when
you’re hurt like we are, you have
to.”

Those hurt seriously Saturday
and doubtuful for this week are:

injury.

Safetyman Barr Leads

Team In Tackles; Cites
ExcellentOrangeAttacl<

by MARTHA HARTLE

When the defense surrenders 50 points, it’s unusual to cite
an individual or outstanding defensive play. But in Saturday’s
loss to Syracuse, safetyman Jeff Barr covered a lot of territory
despite what the score may indicate.

The junior from Canton, Ohio led the team in tackles’ several of ’

which saved touchdowns at time. He also came up with a key intercep-
tion in the end zone. Barr explained that it’s very unusual for a safety-

man to be in on so many tackles.

“It shouldn’t happen,” he com-
mented. “It just seemed that they
always wound up downfield with
the ball. They had a real good'de-
fense. And the offensive line was
good too. It opened up a lot of
holes.”

The razzle-dazzle plays by the
usually conventional Orangemen
also surprised Barr. “They did
surprise me, expecially at the be-
ginning of the. game, with their re-
verses and reverse passes. But
I expected that fake punt pass play
by Art Thorns. We decided to rush
on that play, but I thought they
might throw and they did.”

Playing only his second game at
the free safety position, Barr ex-
plained that the Syracuse passing
game was not as good as others he
has faced. “They weren’t that
good, but they.._used their receivers
well and ran a lot of good patterns.
They put their receivers where it
was hard to cover them.”

For the first three quarters
Saturday, the defense played bet-
ter than it had all year. “When
we realized we could "stop them,
we played real good,” Barr com-
mented.

“But in the second half we
didn’t do our job, he added. “We
couldn’t stop their big play. Once
they got 29 points, our guys be-
gan to feel that it’s just another
game down. the drain-. Once it
seems we’re going to lose, we quit.
And Ben Swartzwalder wanted to
see as many points as he could
put up there.”

In playing what he considers
his best game of the year, Barr
didn’t comeout unscarred. He in-
jured his hand and may miss the
Navy game this week. “We took
X-rays and I think it’s just sprain-

Cats Hurting This,Week

—Ed Gallin —- shoulder separation.

——Mickey Hutchko — injured tibia,
fibia bones around the knee, but
probably none broken.

—Joe McCain —— suffered a muscle
rip in sternum-clavicle area.

——Lloyd Weston -— re-injured knee.

Many other players suffered
minor hurts that will impair their
efficiency during the coming
Week. This does not include John
Wozniak, Ken Schumaker, Ralph
Cindrich and Norm Smith who
were hurt earlier in the season.
Even if most of these players can
play against Navy next Satur-
day, and many can’t, they will

On Injured List
ed. I sure hope I don’t miss this
week’s game, but I can’t say for
sure.”

Barr was switched from corner-
back to safety two weeks ago. He
moved over to Bryant Salter’s
spot, while Salter switched to cor-
nerback.

“In the first couple of games, I
was having trouble outside and
Bryant was having trouble in-
side,” explained Barr’ “Bryant is
good in one on one situations,
which you get playing corner-
back. At safety, you have to be
more conscious of everything and
watch the receivers on both sides.

Skip Makes
Kyasky Look

Overrated  

If Syracuse defensive back
Tony Kyasky is an A1l-Ameri-
can, he would have had a hard
time convincing a lot of people
of it last Saturday. Panther
end Skip Orszulak gave Kya-
sky a rough afternoon, catching
six passes for 130 yards.

Included in Skip’s statistics
was a 67-yard touchdown catch.
Two other times Orszulak caught
the ball with nobody between him
and the goalline, but the muddy
area around the sidelines carried
him out of bounds. Afterwards,
Skip refused to demean Kyasky.

‘ “It’s hard on a defensive back,
whether he’s all American or not,
whenever you isolate him one-on
one,” he commented. “The of-
fense has the advantage and it’s
tough on anybody. If you don’t
have a good day against one-on-
one coverage, then you can consi-
der yourself the loser.”

Kyasky made a few appologies
afterwards, but also admitted that
Orszulak surprised him.

“I had a bad game altogether,"
he said. “Orszulak was a lot bet-
ter than I thought he’d be. He’s not
a bad receiver. but he’s good be-

v cause of his hands. not because of

his speed."

On the other hand. Skip — and _ 1

most of.the Panthers — thought
Orszulak had such a good day be-
cause he was faster-than Kyasky.

Despite Faster Times,  
Distancemen Finish 7th

By BILL NAAB

They ran their fastest times of the season. Yet, coach
Jim Banner’s cross country squad finished seventh among the
many rugged competitors at Friday’s Notre Dame Invitational.

Eastern Michigan, Western Michigan, and Michigan captured the
top three spots. Still, coach Banner mentioned that he was pleased with
his squad time-wise, but not place—wise.

“I didn’t think it would be that fast of a race,” said Banner. He in-
dicated that the flat course was the key factor which caused the fast
times. “They (the opposition) run over a flat course all the time. We’re
not used to flat land,” Banner explained. According to Banner’ the
barriers will not compete on a flat-type course again this seaso.n.

‘r

Overall, Banner stated that his squad performed well, but could l

have done better in a few places. Nonetheless, the distancemen beat out
most of the Big ten and Mid America Conference schools.

“We were definitely ahead of Purdue and Northwestern,” offered
Banner, “but the squad was disappointed. They hope to come back and
do better.” He indicated that it was a “funny kind of meet” in that the
colleges were permitted to run as many cross countrymen as they de-
sired. “Some schools ran ten or fifteen kids. In all, about 160 indivi-
duals entered the competition.”

Meanwhile, the really bright news, as usual, was Jerry Richey. }

Again, Richey set a new course record. His 23:58 time won the race,
but not without a stiff challenge. “Jerry really didn’t win the race until
about the last 150 yards,” Banner commented. Notre Dame’s junior
ace, Bob Watson, and Kent State’s Norris finished second and third
,§respectively. '

' Richey stated that he really wasn’t overly elated about winning the
tough Notre Dame Invitational, mainly because he felt confident be-
fore the race that he would win. " ‘ _
I’m not really surprised.” remarked Richey, “but I did have to

Soccermen Lose Defensive Duel to Temple, 1-0

by ED CONLEY

PHILADELPHIA—Nino Vitorio slapped a goal past kicker
goallie Len Harmon, who had come out on the play, at 6:20 of
the opening quarter; that was the last_of the scoring as the soccer
team lost here to Temple, 1-0, Saturday.

Temple followed the same game plan that they have used through-
out the young season —— play for one score, and then lay back on defense.
It has worked well, too. The Owls have a 3-1 record.

Their defense was so strong,
the booters had trouble getting
shots off. The Owl goalie, Walt
Wilkinson, was forced to make only
four stops.

However, the kicker defense
was not to be out-done. After that

GAME TOMORROW

The Booters visit Grove
City, tomorrow, in an attempt
to even their record with the
Grovers. Coach Leo Bemis’
team has won six and lost seven
previous meetings, and there has
been one tie.

Last fall the Grovers grabbed
an easy 3-0 victory and the boot-
ers would like to get some reven-
ge. The opportunity is there, too,
because the kickers have improved
consistently this season, despite
a not-too—impressive mark of 1-3.

“We can beat them,” Bemis re-
lates. “They beat Slippery Rock
4-2, and we beat them, 3-0.”

He realizes that comparing
scores doesn’t mean very much,

“They’re big and rugged,” the
coach continued. “They play a run-
over-you type of game.

“We may have to watch out for
the fast break, too,” he mention-
ed.

~ That is about all Bemis knows

iabout the Grovers. He expects

to find out a bit more before game
time. As of right now, however,-
he doesn’t expect them to be as
tough as teams- like West Chester
and Temple. ‘

“We know that we can move the
ball against teams» like Temple,
so we should be able to do it
against Grove.

  

one mistake, the booter backfield
matched their opposition practi-
cally play for play. Harmon was
credited with only five saves at
the end of the game.

Coach Leo Bemis insists that
his club was not_ playing a de-
fensive game, though.

“We weren’t. They were.” he
commented.

His offense just couldn’t cope
with the strategy of the Owls.
“I expected a little bit more. A lot
of the game was played at mid-
field and both teams kept the ball
up in the air” Bemis remarked.

The coach did find one thing a
bit more upsetting than the loss,
which he thought showed that his
team can play with the so-called
best.

“We should have kept the ball
away from (Bob) Pefﬂe. We kept

. going where he was,” Bemis said.

Peffle is the All-American in

the Owl backfield. “You’ve got to
be smart that way,” the coach em-
phasized.

He didn’t think the kickers’ of-

ifensive attack was as weak as it

appeared during the game, though.

He Mentioned, “When we passed,
we passed well. We’ll just have to
put it down more and make the ~
passes a bit more snappy.”

The coach still believes that one
of the reasons for the squad’.s'
passing problems is that they have
to practice on Kennard Field.

LEO BEMIS
Reviews Third Shut-out

“When you pass on the grass
(Kennard is a dirt field) the ball
moves differently; you have to ads
just after the first ten minutes._”

He added, however, “We should
have adjusted after the first ten
minutes.”

Bemis wasn’t bothered too much
by the fact that his team was
blamed for the third time in four
games _either.~.

“We can score. We’ll just have to

gor for it ( a goal ) and get it,” he _ , ’ A

remarked.

Referring to ‘the loss to Temple,
he pointed out, “We just weren't

getting the shots, and neither A

they.”

This has been the story for It
least one of the teams in each of the
booters’ games this fall. Every
game has resulted in a shut-out
for one of the teams. The kickers,
of course, have been that team
only once.

But, Bemis continued to stress
that the situation isn’t too bad.
He quipped, “Soccer is a defen-
sive game, anyway. ”

The freshman soccer team
proved on Saturday that it was
able to correct the mistakes
that had plagued it in its season’s
opener against Slippery Rock. In
beating Johnstown campus 3-1,
the booters displayed marked im-
provement in passing and defense.

Coach Pete Snyder was pleased
with the squad’s performance in
his first coaching career victory.

“The team looked real good to-'

day,” he stated.

“The boys were passing to the
wings and moving the ball better
than last week. Also, the fullbacks
were catching the opponent’s wing-
men faster,” he added.

The frosh started the contest in
high gear by outshooting UPJ 10-1
in the first quarter. However, the
concentrated shooting attack on
the visitor’s goal did not provide
a score.

The booter’s pressure on Johns-
town’s net continued in the sec-
ond stanza. With only minutes gone
in the period, Tony Nicholapoulos

set up the first tally. After drib- 

bling by two defenders, he passed
to center forward Leon Banegin
who was clear in front of the net.
His shot easily beat the goalie
to make the score 1-0.

Several minutes later, the fresh-
men received their biggest break
of the game. As Al Walcott, Johns-
town’s right fullback, tried to head
the ball out of his goal area, he ac-
cidently knocked it into the goal,
for the frosh’s second goal.

Near the end of the half, Nich-

Johnstown’s lone goal came in.
the third quarter. As the ball re-
bounded off the chest of fresh-
man goalie John Giorgio, Johns-
town’s Keyong Turk hit it intothe
open net.

Each team had many scoring
opportunities in the final period,
but neither one could put the ball
into the net. Unlike the first half,
the action was not centered in
Johnstown’s end. The frosh seem-

ed unwilling to keep the pressure I

Language Requirement System
Needs Flexibility, Practicability

Seven students were present at the 10la.m. session of the language‘

ry were on hand to answer questions pertinent to the topic.

‘In the opening opening remarks, Dr. Kehl stated that compe-

 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
     
  
   
     
   
  
     
     
  
      
  
    
   
  

decision - making power, how do you get them to
participate?”

Dr. Joseph Zasloff of the Political Science De-

partment answered that recognition of student pres-

sure and interests is the best assurance that useful
mechanisms will evolve to incorporate Students
into the decision-making process.

Schueler proposed the present system used in
the School of Engineering as a model for student
participation in academic decisions. He pointed out
that engineering students are required to attend
regular meetings and seminars which study curri-
clum needs and general issues. “This,” he explain-
ed, “gives all students a chance to express their de-
sire for change and innovation.”

Schueler added that “the ques-
tion of academic representation

Chancellor Wesley Posvar told an early morning audience Saturday in the SU
Ballroom, “It is up to the University community to play a part of creative leadership in

The Chancellor told the 80 people gathered that the confusion in universitites
across the country is a very bad problem. “Today’s educators are confused and criti-
cized,” he said, “but it is our intention at the University not to be confused but rather
concerned in a constructive way.” The Chancellor proceeded to relate this confusion in

the universitities to the urban crisis we are experi-
encing today. “Even if we achieve perfect com-
munication in the Universitythere will not get a
sense of fulfillment unless the University commun-
ity can contribute to helping the urban crisis,” he
commented. '

port of “student power” as long as it is “responsible

The Chancellor summarized his speech by say-

relating the University to society was again empha-

It was also pointed out that most students are here to learn, and giving students power to make de-

1‘ -tance is the major concern of the language departments in this univer-

ﬁeuducated person’s liberal education, because a deep understanding
-I of another culture, which is necessary, is basic in language.

- _ Many questions were raised as to whether or not mastery of a
‘language can be achieved in such a short space of time, and the gen-
‘ eral concensus of opinion was that it cannot be reached, but no better
. ‘method could beposed. The value is thought to be in how the language
’ V; is taught and what is taught.

, There were definitely dissatisfied people with the system of ed-
iucation. ‘For those who are not good in language, it pulls down the
QPA of the student. Also, language in levels one through four does not
— count in the distribution of studies. ‘

_ There were, however, some things that were liked about the lan-
guage requirements. For example, they do teach culture and a basic
 understanding of linguistics.

V The idea of flexibility was also brought up. It was stated that for

-quality in a liberal education, it is extremely difficult to make this

P system more flexible. Culture courses were not thought to be good in

themselves because there is a certain value in learning about people

, through their own language and its literature, and four terms are
necessary to come to this level of understanding. c

The basic conclusion of the seminar was that the system needs to
be more integrated, more flexible, and more practical interms of the
"average student.

In the discussion of Student
Government, two basic concepts
were formed concerning lack of
communication a m o n g the stu-
dents themselves and between the
students, faculty, and administra-
tion. Several theories were formu-
lated to try to rectify this situa-
tion.

The first suggestion was that

SG be abolished per se and some
type of system of small commit-
tees be initiated. Many people
felt that good ideas got lost in the
bureaucracy of an organization
such as SG. However, there was
some dissention. How do you get
a representative sample of the
people involved? How can you
bring such small groups together
to have a representative structure,
to incorporate ideas, and resolve
campus-wide problems? To solve
this problem, several people sug-
gested to have chairmen from
each group meet and incorporate
their ideas into a meaningful di-
rection.

Also, the point of the -Student
Power movement was mentioned

as a bargaining agent. but it was

identified as, a» movement_ with

, -. . very. little. ‘force behind it; N'one-  »

theless, the members of tha t
group who werepresent did have
suggestions—to formulate ideas, to
study them, to compile a report,

' to turn it into the authorities, and

then to have the authorities vote_
on it within a certain 'length of
time. -

Oh the other hand, there were
advocates of the SG system, but
they felt that there should be bet-
ter organization in the system.
Being as there are cabinets in SG
with members from areas of ma-
jor concern, and that SG is the of-
-ficial representative body of the
students. It therefore seems bet-
ter to work through these means
to avoid uncertainty to adequate
student body representation.

No real solution was agreed up-
on, but each side came to an un-
derstanding of the other sides val- ‘
ue in_ solving the problem of
change in this University.

The vulgarity of the Pitt News
was criticized and Tiernan coun-
tered that this was due to a “com-
bination of immaturity of the
writers and a lack of attention on
the part of the editors.”

The paper was also criticized

_ for inaccuracy and Tiernan once
again answered. He attributed this.

to inexperience. and emphasized
thatthe staff was working hard to
remove this as well as the stigma
of vulgarity. He also said that re-
fusal to talk to reporters would
not help solve the problem.

In the discussion on courses, the
academic, political, and social
pressures which compel one out
of three students to seek psychi-
atric help were mentioned.

Faculty and students both felt
that a serious re-evaluation of the
language requirement was need-
ed. Suggestions included reduc-
ing the requirement to only two
terms, adopting a pass-fail system
and introducing some cultural’
study into the course. .
