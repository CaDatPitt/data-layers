Press Strike Persists; .5.z“b0.T0 Arrive

Talks Resume Today

by RON ANKOWSKI

Negotiations will resume this
afternoon between spokesmen for
the Pittsburgh Press and repre-
sentatives of the Typographical
Union. Local 7, in an effort to end
the 18-day newspaper strike.

Although no apparent progress
toward settlement was made during
the second round of talks last
Friday. Federal mediator Arthur
Wellman cited the agreement to
meet again today as a “hopeful
sign."

“The Press and printers have
many difficult problems to solve."
he said, “but relations at the bar-
gaining table are good, and they‘re
seriously trying to find a way to
resolve the work stoppage."

Since Press facilities print
both city daily newspapers, Post-
Gazette publication is also sus-
pended, thus marking the second
time this year that Pittsburgh’s
two dailys have blacked out by
astrike-.

According to Press spokesman
the printers are reportedly seeking
a pay increase of more than $70
per week. Reportedly. the Press
has offered the union a weekly
raise in excess of $50.

Meanwhile the Press is con-
ducting talks with at least four
other craft unions whose contracts
are due to expire. Speculation is
that the present dispute will not
be settled until these additional
negotiations are finalized.

Another Pittsburgh newspaper,
The Forum. reported an increase
in circulation since the beginning
of the strike. '

Previous to the strike. the pa-
per had a subscription circulation
of 2.000 and a newsstand circula-
tion of 2.100. According to a For-
um reporter. overall circulation
has increased between 2.000 and
3.000.

No one was available at the
Courier, a Pittsburgh weekly. to
comment on possible circulation
increase of that paper.

Saga Eulogized, Scored

(Editor's Note: Szabo Food Serv-
ice will begin serving students this
summer, as Saga Food Service
ends an I l year stint with the Uni-
versity.

(Later this week, Szabo and
Saga representatives will make
arrangements for the transition,
which both companies are report-
edly anxious to expedite.

(According to John Vrana, direc-
tor of Housing, Szabo was selected
over Saga and two other food con-
tractors because of Szabo’s reput-
ation at other colleges and because
of specific provisions in its bid.

(For example, Szabo has agreed
in advance to make no more than a
three per cent basic profit on its
operations. Income beyond the
three per cent will be split 50-50
between Szabo and the Univer-
sity.

(In contrast, Sago offered to
make as much as a five per cent
profit. Saga would have kept 80
per cent of additional income for

Scott Marries Politics, Medicine

by MIKE MILLER

According to Pennsylvania Sen-
ator Hugh Scott. politicians and
doctors must collaborate to shape
a better world.

Senator Scott informed 96 grad-
uates of the School of Medicine
Thursday of a close relationship
between politics and medicine
which stems from responsibil-
ities incurred as a result of med-
ical advances.

Scott: Relates Socrates, Hippocrates

“Man has an intense aware-
ness of survival, and he demands
that his body politic minister to
his body temporal,” he said in a
speech entitled “Medicine—the
Fantastic Voyage.”

He also cited a number of gov-
ernment programs involving med-
ical education and medical care.

Following the ceremony. the
Republican leader expressed his
topics of current interest in a
Pitt News interview.

Considering the recent anti-
war protests in Washington, the
Senator said he felt that the Viet-
nam Veterans greatly impressed
Congress with their sincerity.

However. he considered later
protests in a different light.

“The first demonstrations were
encouraging. proper and accept-
able. but after the Trotsk_vites got
there everything went to hell.

The Senator referred to the
more militant demonstrators as
a “bad lot" of “nasties who were
there to cause trouble and make
headlines, and they erased the
good impression made by the
Vietnam Veterans.”

Senator Scott said he hoped.
however, that the Congress could
be as impressive as the Vietnam
Veterans in expressing their sin-
cerity towards ending the war.

He cited statistics which state
that the cost of the war has been
cut in half. that the troops in
Vietnam are being reduced to one-
third of previous totals. that the
casualities have been reduced by
one-tenth and that bombing mis-
sions now amount to only one-
third of the former total.

“These facts are too obvious
to warrant disbelief,” he said.
“but the public rejects all of
this.”

Senator Scott predicts that by
the end of next year there will be
no draftees in Vietnam and that a
volunteer army will then be feas-
able.

He said he feels. however. that
a two-year extension of the draft
will be necessary to gain time for
a phasing out of the present sys-
tem.

“I believe a two year extension
will pass,” he said. “I prefer a
volunteer army, but we're one
million men short. I hope this is
the last time around.”

He stated that student defer-
ments should be eliminated. Af-
ter a volunteer army becomes a
reality. he added. the present se-
lective service system should be
maintained on a stand-by basis.

The Senator also discussed do-
mestic problems. including the

SST controversy and the mass
transit problems in Pittsburgh.

Senator Scott voted in favor of
building two prototypes of the
Supersonic Transports (SST) be-
cause “the United States has no
right to turn its back on scienti-
fic progress.”

He said that if the United States
does not build the plane. France
and Russia will use “economic
blackmail“ to force the US into
buying their planes.

Thus. according to Scott. Amer-
icans will he riding the SST‘ and

itself, providing the University with
the remaining 20 per cent.

(Vrana revealed that, before the
University made its decision, a
group of students traveled to va-
rious college campuses served by
Szabo and were favorably im-
messed bv the food, the service,
and the attitude of student diners
toward Szabo.

(According to Vrana, a variety of
meal tickets will be available to
students this fall. Meal tickets at
various prices for differing num-
bers of meals will be available to
students.)

g by SALLIE ALLEN
The recent announcement of
Saga Food Service’s replace-
ment has left University students
with mixed emotions.

A random survey of students
following the announcement show-
ed the most common disagree-
ment among the students con-
cerning Saga: the quality of the
food in Schenley Cafeteria. where
spring resident students are fed.
"Fall and winter weren’t had."
said sophomore Laurie Rafkin.
"but spring is simply awful. You
get the same meals every day
disguised in different sauces. “

Sophomore Lance Wall agrees.
saying “any time they have Slop-
py Joes with no buns. you know
it's terrible."

Eugene Heintz, a senior, said
he thinks that it’s about time the
University got a new food service.
“Although the food isn’t that bad
compared to other places,” he
said, “they (Saga) always make
it good before the contract and
then it deteriorate s afterwards. I
hope the new food service doesn’t
disappoint me.”

Although most students said
that the University‘s food could
never replace a home-cooked

meal. many agreed that it is pret-
ty good for institutionalized food.

Therefore. it was not the cafe-
teria food that bothered them. but
the food in the Towers Snack Bar.
the Hunt Room, and the Tuck
Shop.

Graduate student Nancy Owens
said she thinks that “the Tuck
Shop is ridiculous-—-the only thing
it is good for is bagels. The ma-
chines don’t always work either.”

Prices were the concern of
many students. “I hope the food
improves without the prices go-
ing up.“ said graduate student
Bill Loebman.

Senior Michael Buncher added.
“It seems as though something
within the University could be es-
tablished for supplying a cheaper
lunch for students.

~ Many students aren’s satisfied
with the quality of the food for the
prices charged. They argue that
they can get the same quality food
for less at restaurants on campus.

Another grip against Saga is
that a student who lives in the
dorms had to buy a meal ticket
whether he ate in the cafeteria
or not. The students said they
should be able to choose for them-
selves whether or not they want
a meal ticket.

Pam Bier. a junior. said that
"it's about time we have a change
in management. The (Saga
would only make a change if the
students pressured them and then
it would only be for a few weeks.“

Senior Joel Parris summed up
the student's feelings when he
said "the new food service might
be worse. but a change now and
then is healthy. After all. we could
always switch back to Saga
again it itdidn twork.“

ASSISTANT DISTRICT Attorney James D. Zimmer addressed members of the Campus Police force who completed a 40
hour municipal police training course. Graduation ceremonies and a dinner were held for 29 graduates of the course
Jhursday evening at the Italian-American Club in Turtle Creek, Pa.

The course, which dealt with Pennsylvania criminal law and criminal procedures, lasted from Marchlb
to May 20. During their training the campus police discussed steps in criminal procedure, laws of arrest, evidence,
search and seizure, larceny and burglarly, and traffic patrol techniques.

course, his pursuit is futile, but
he proves that if the meek must

be meek, they may still inherit_

the mirth.

Pure mirth is Allen‘s message.
In Bananas, he blends a few one
liners and not much satire with
an array of sight gags and gim-
micks. Because it is so basic,
this type of humor can irritate
if allowed to ramble unbounded.
Fortunately, the film. runs little
longer than an hour, time enough
to enjoy Allen’s wistful wittiness.

Allen. who also wrote and di-
rected the feature now at the For-

technical aspects of the film to
its forte—Allenfs own comic tal-

Stones’ °Sticky Fingers’ Tasty Tidbits

by RON LOZOWSKI

With the Beatles’ departure
from the group scene. the way was
opened for the Rolling Stones to
assert their claim as the uncon-
tested royalty of rock. Unfortu-
nately. their latest release. Sticky
Fingers, still leaves some doubts
concerning the Stones’ supremacy.

The outlandish jacket arouses
fears that the group may be fall-
ing into the same sexist pitfalls
thatquickened the Doors’ down-

fall; purveyors of the groups so-
called "image" could have a field
day with this one. This cover
blatantly displays a pair of blue
jeans. topped off with an authen-
tic working zipper that opens'to
reveal—underwear?

But wait. all is not lost. The
Stones haven't quite yet lost their
grip. Sticky Fingers offers some
high—intensity rock, including the
number one single “Brown Su-
gar“—-a typical Stones‘ number
that rocks right along.

Page 4—THE PITT NEWS—Tuesday, June 1, 1971

GRI

by NANCY DEMPSEY
Special to the Pitt News

Earth Day 1970 was a much-publicized
event. It was designed to make Ameri-
cans aware of words such as “environ-
ment” and “ecology” and what they mean
to us collectively as citizens of the world,
and individually as inhabitants of the
earth. It was highly successful in achieving
this goal.

In contrast, Earth Week 1971 was in-
tended to fulfill a very different purpose.
There was no national coordination. All ef-
forts were locally-oriented and low-key,
with the focus on what specific progress
was made during the year, -and what still

\ needed to be done.

In Pittsburgh, collection centers for
solid waste materials—glass, newspapers.
and cans—-are provided by Grip )group
for Recycling in Pennsylvania). The Oak-
land depot is run by volunteers on
Sundays from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m.

. “Separation” is the key word in muni-
cipal solid-waste recycling, according to
James Weissburg, consulting engineer by
profession, and by inclination a volunteer
at the Fifth Ave. and South Craig St. grip
station.

"The more separate things can be
made,” Weissburg said, “the more value

_. ’ they have. Separation costs are very ex-
 ‘ pensive. The more people can do volun-
 ‘_ tarily, the better. if we don’t get individ-

uals to do it . .  he paused, “well, we can
never pay union scale to have it done.”

Four hundred cars each Sunday bring
materials to the station, proving that peo-
ple will separate their trash.

Average household trash consists of 50
per cent paper, 15 per cent glass and cans;
separating and recycling would mean a
two-thirds reduction in curb garbage
pick-up each week.

“Urban ore” is the new term being
applied to this municipal solid-waste:
“ore" because it has resources.

few cadillacs, many buses
Who brings their “urban ore” to the
GRIP station? Cars offer a reliable index
to the people who care.

There are a great many “little” cars,
and these are filled. Medium-sized cars
bring moderate loads; the station sees
few Cadillacs. Often neighborhood pools
are formed, with different drivers bring-
ing the collection each week. Many peo-
ple come by bus.

One lady from the nearby Pennsyl-
vania Association for the Blind comes reg-
ularly with her bag of cans and bottles, led
by a friend._ A large number of foreign stu-
dents come to the station; perhaps they
are more aware of the need than affluent.
apathetic Americans.

Newspapers are unacceptable unless
bundled. One car‘s load of papers was

 

turned away with this explanation. Two
hours later, the same car was back, the
newspapers neatly bundled.

The paper is given to the Salvation
Army, which in turn sends it to Chicago, the
nearest de-inking plant, a process neces-
sary prior to recycling.

Grip accepts clean bottles and jars.
Metal lids must be removed. Twist-off
rings on soft-drink bottles are a major
problem. They must come off before re-
cycling, and customers could help by re-
moving them at home.

Papterlabels are removed in a water-
wash at the glass plant. Deposit bottles
are separated and returned to re-users.

Colored glass cannot be melted with
clear glass because it_ muddies the clear,
so bottles are separated for color. The sep-
arated glass is smashed in a “churning”
process to make it more convenient for
packing. It is crated and trucked to a lo-
cal glass company which buys it for re-

Cans present another problem. After
both ends are removed and kept separate.
the can is pressed flat. Steel and alumi-
num cans must be separated before re-
cycling since steel' cans have leaded
seams. In the recycling furnaces, lead
melts rapidly and flows to one side. acting
as an insulator, a technical problem not
yet overcome.

Volunteers to Process “Urban Ore’

”taking care of the customers”

At the Oakland collection center, the
atmosphere is bustling and noisy, the feel-
ing is one of congenial corporate activ-
ity. No one seems unhappy, no quarrels
break out, though often the volunteers ap-
pear overworked.

The attitude towards customers is
cheerful. “Two things come first,“ a volun-
teer stated, “safety and taking care of the
customers. "

This is evident as volunteers direct cars
through the drive-in area, unload bundles,
boxes and bags; give directions—“Ma’am,
next time would you remove the lids,
please?”

The sound of breaking glass begins at
10 a.m. each Sunday but there have been
no complaints from occupants of the apart-
ments surrounding the Pittsburgh Nation-
al Bank drive-in area that serves as the
collection depot.

Financially, selling the glass and metal
to local outlets just about pays for truck
rental and insurance carried for the Oak-
land operation. On a given Sunday, collec-
tion totals equal one truckload of glass,
one of cans and two of newspapers.

Municipal solid-waste disposal might
be though of as an understanding problem.
People must ‘understand the processes at
work and then they may be ready to ask,
“What specifically can I do to help?”

GRIP has at least a partial answer.

 Messing Up System?

..

r by SALLIE ALLEN
Special to the Pitt News

Time was when you could sit in a lecture hall, take notes, split

A‘ them back during exams, and pass a course. You never got the impres-
sion you were learning very much, but at least you were headed some-

where—if only towards graduation.
Lately, though, they've been messing up the system with some-

I thing called the ”unstructured class,” where you have to decide what’s

to be done. Can you imagine, they actually expect us to think?
“I guess it’s just what’s to be expected ‘in hard times like these.

After all, if the state can’t afford to give the universities higher ap- .

propriations, then of course we'll just have to put with poorer pro-

’ fessors who can’t figure things out for themselves . . 

Whatever the reason, you happily melt into the unstructure, not to
be seen again till next semester, spending 15 weeks of class time pre-
tending to rap about what you’re going to do and never having time to
do it . . . not that you ever intended to do anything anyway.

“Our parents are paying hard for our credits, why should. we have
to work for them besides?"
And the beat goes on . . . . .

We're forever quoting and paraphrasing the infamous “I’m going
to college to get a degree—any education I get on the way is purely
coincidental” and yet when we finally do get something to do about it,
we sit there. ‘

“Oh, I .used to get enthusiastic about those things, that is, until I

.sat in on a couple of classes and found out I was the only one who had

visions of learning something.“

After a few classes of apathy, it’s hard to build up enthusiasm to
even try to make a new one work . . . chances are, everyone else in the
class feels that way too——but does that mean the system’s a flop?

What we have now is a chance to really learn things for ourselves
in a really interesting way . . . we have a chance to do things that stu-
dents even 20 years ago never dreamed about . . . a chance to de-
cide what we want to learn and not just what a professor thinks is in-
teresting and proper. -

Allwe have to do is think a little.

And put forth a bit of effort.

If everyone in the class» just tried a little harder, maybe college
would become a place to get an education.

Give a little.

Five and 'six—year—olds do it, why not us? Or did you enjoy mem-
orizing the Constitution?

l’ve had many heros in my life,
but I think my first was a life-
guard.

In Sayre, Pa., my small home
town, the community" swimming
pool is the only place that offers
supervised recreation during the
long, hot summer afternoons. And

so, when I was seven, I became a '

“pool rat.”

I ate, drank, and slept with only
one thing in mind, and that was
the swimming pool. I spent nearly
every waking hour there and
through the years, became a pro-
ficient swimmer.

At ll, I began taking lifesaving
courses so that I too would become
a lifeguard. The lifeguards, those
whistle-bedecked creatures, im-
pressed me to no end.

They taught me everything I
knew about the thing I loved best,
swimming. One guard had even
saved me when, at six, I over-
estimated my ability and jumped
into 11 feet of water. What could
I do but idealize them?

The whole point of this little
dissertation is that, after work-
ing my way up the aquatic ladder
(from beginner swimmer to wa-
ter safety instructor), I‘ve finally
reached the goal that l’ve held long-
est in my life. I’m a lifeguard.

And being a lifeguard scares
me sometimes. I’m not afraid of
the responsibilities that accom-
pany the job because I know I’m
capable of handling any emergen-
cy situation. That’s what I've been
trained to do.

It’s all that hero worship that
is floating around the pool that
bothers me. Maybe it‘s natural
for young children to look up to a
lifeguard or anyone else who
watches out for them five or six
hours a day for three months. But
I can‘t help but wonder if I'm
worthy of all that adulation.

The kids see lifeguards as
strong, capable, and someone to
impress. But I know that I’m just
as fallible as anyone else and
can’t convince the kids, especial-
ly the younger children, that a

Hero Wonshlip May ‘Be The
Biggest Responsibilty of All

lifeguard is anything but super-
human.

I’m, not putting down hero wor-
ship, but sometimes it becomes
very uncomfortable. The kids at
my swimming pool are some of
the finest younger people I've
ever met and, for this reason, they
make me very wary of falling short
of their expectations.

When I tell people that I’m em-
ployed as a lifeguard during the
summer, they just sort of laugh
and say, “Oh, you don’t ‘work’ dur-
ing the summer." But lifeguard-
ing isn't quite as easy as it may
seem, as I’ve pointed out in this
column.

I hold not only the lives but
the respect of many young chil-
dren in my hands and it's some-
times hard to cope with. I don’t
want to disillusion any of them
because I enjoyed the illusions of
my childhood. And besides that,
what this world of ours doesn’t
need is more disillusioned kids
from Sayre, Pa. ‘

Film Studies Rated “X”

by ROSSIE S. JACKSON
Special to the Pitt News

“Movies are a Bastard Cross-
-Fertilized Super Art,”

—Pauline Kael,
New Yorker Film Critic

Leave out Miss Kael’s last four
words and "bastard" exempli-
fies the Pitt administrations at-
titude toward an undergraduate
cinema communications school.
Film is the art with no depart-
ment at Pitt.

Its courses fall under various
headings at literature (Novel and
Film). speech (Film Aesthetics
and History), and anthropology
(Evolution of Man Through Film
Making).

If the University doesn't soon
get a communications school. one
will have to read the entire course
description book to find a film
course.

Schools from UCLA to Boston
University have film-study pro-

   

grams. Recently Temple University
in Philadelphia initiated a doc-
toral-level program.

Pitt is moving too slowly. Last
year, “The History of American
Cinema” was taught. This year it
was dropped and “The Aesthe-
tics of Film" took its place. Are
we only allowed one course per
term‘?

Not only are we short on
courses. we are short on films.
Numerous articles have appear-
ed in the Pitt News about our
glorious film library. But upon in-
spection, the Hillman Film Col-
lection contains only one aesthe-
tic-commercial film. The Blue
Angel, and it is not even Amer-
ican-made.

Does this imply that foreign
films are superior to American?
Maybe . . . American films are
looked down upon by various in-
structors as tasteless youth-ori-

ented popular culture. Film schol- ,

 

ars are viewed as movie buffs too
lazy to read.

This must end. Films on Pitt’s
campuses must have their place
in the sun with literature, music,
painting, and most of all, theater.

Why is a staunch theater advo-
cate teaching Pitt's only film
course? This man lectured last
term comparing screen acting to
stage acting, in which the latter
was praise to the heights.

The administration needs to
stop dragging its feet and give
this “bastard super art“ a father
in the name of a good film depart-
ment. a complete library. and a
qualified instructor.

1 Was it only two weeks ago that the Panthers were riding on
 a perfect game pitched by Mike Fedoris and then followed up
that feat by emerging victorious in the first annual Turnpike
_ Tournament held at Cleveland State‘?

; (In two weeks many things can happen to a ball team—and
V Penn State happened to Pitt. Last weekend the Panthers drop-
ped‘ a doubleheader to the Nittany Lions and subsequently lost
ggalli hope of geing selected to the District Two Tournament
 ‘at the NCAA. .
_ “Theguys played all year for the NCAA bid only to be
ﬂnosedout at- the last minute by Penn State,” explained Pan-
-._the.r..hurler Mike Niccols on the return trip from University
.. Park. - l - — --

A To compenstate for_the loss of the
(‘bid to the coveted NCAA Tournament
 ~the .mitters were to compete in the
3 . Akron Tournament.

g ! i:‘The Akron Tournament will mean
, a lot if we win.“ related Niccols. "It
V‘-‘will make the whole year meaningful."

 ‘_Befitting the run of luck «the Pan-
g thers have had in the last two weeks,
themitters never saw Akron, let alone
iwinthe tournament. At the last minute
, Ashland and Cleveland State pulled
out and the tournament was cancelled.

that “overall it was a good season-the guys did a pretty good
<jlob.‘” ’ ‘

”‘~_The-big question mark at the beginning of the season was
the infield. but the question was soon answered by shortstop
Terry Stokes. first baseman Ken Macha. second baseman Bob
_Livingston (all three players were selected to play in the
College All-Star game). and Paul Quarantillo and Danny Slain
alternating at third.

« “Our infield made some mental mistakes but did a good job
.‘throughout the season,” said Lewis. “I was anticipating having
this same infield back again, but if Stokes signs that leaves a
hole again at short that I hadn’t counted on” (Stokes is eligible
'to sign a professional contract).

, “We'll be losing Bob Solonickne and John Fredland in the
Tofutfield next year and they‘ll certainly be missed." stated

Lewis. "Sollie,‘s very dependable and you sometimes take him
for granted~he‘s always in the right spot at the right time.
_‘John”is also dependable on the bench and as a regular.”

, Lewis got the expected good pitching and will only lose two
of his hurlers——Frank Mincarelli and Niccols who produced the
igest record of 5-1 .< Niccols. a junior is ineligible to play his senior
3 year having already pitched three years).

The hitting wonder for the Panthers was Macha who bat-
ted over .400 all season and hammered seven homeruns and col-
; lected 31 RBI's.

" Regardless of these last two disasterous weeks the Panthers
do,n‘t,plan to lose any games next season. j I A

Mitters Use Reserves In Final
1 Victory Of 18-8/ Spring Season ~

Last Thursday. the Panther
baseball squad closed; out its
season with the a 5-1 victory over
Allegheny College. Coach Bobby
Lewis cleared his bench in the
contest and gave many rookies
and reserves a chance to play.

The five pitchers who started
games this season shared the
mound duties. Mike Niccols start-
ed and hurled two frames and was
followed by Frank Mincarelli. Al-
bie Sylanski. Rich Muse and Mike
Fedoris.

Niccols gave up the only Alle-
gheny run in the first inning. but
the mitters bounced back to grab
thelead for good with two tallies
in the bottom half of the inning.

The Panthers added two more
runs in the fifth and a single
score in the seventh to wrap up
the victory.

Len Raffa. a rookie who rode
the bench all season. socked a
double in his first turn at bat
and exhibited fine defensive play
by cutting down an Allegheny run-
ner at the plate.

Bill Schmitke. who saw limited
action at catcher behind Guy
Caparelli, also hit a double in
the fifth.

The win gave the squad a final
