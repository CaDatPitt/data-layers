Assistant News Editor

The Allegheny County Health Department
reported its ﬁndings Friday on the E. coli
investigation regarding The Porch restau-
rant in Oakland. On Oct. 30, the depart-
ment began asking health care providers
‘to test patients for the O157:H7 strain of
E. coli. ’

“There were 12 conﬁrmed cases of E.
coli O157:H7 and nine others with sug-
gestive symptoms who~could not be con-
ﬁrmed. We have been unable to pinpoint
the source of the E. coli — whether it
came from a particular food product, food
handling or a combination of both,” said
Health Department Director Karen Hacker.

Of the dozen cases, eight individuals
were hospitalized.

Pat Ritz, a spokesman for The Porch,
emphasized that the restaurant had
worked to ease concern among the com-
munity. The restaurant created a toll-free
hotline. '

Hacker conﬁrmed that the restaurant
had “fully cooperated” with the Health
Department. -

The investigation reported that most

Fundraiser requires contestants to don heels

Cristina Holtzer
Staff Writer

A group of Pitt men will walk a mile for charity
on Tuesday.

But instead of their usual sneakers, these
men will be wearing high heels.

The sisters of Pitt’s Gamma Sigma Sigma
service sorority will host “Walk a Mileiin
Her Shoes” at 9 p.m. Tuesday in 121 David
Lawrence Hall. Admission costs $1 and all
ticket—sale proceeds will go to the March of
Dimes, a nonproﬁt that beneﬁts families with
premature chﬂdren. , ‘

Junior rehabilitation sciences major and
Gamma Sigma Sigma Public Relations Co.-
ordinator Maria Lopez said she hopes the

silliness of the event will attract a large crowd
of students.

“We did not anticipate that so many guys
would be willing to do it,” Lopez said. “We’re
deﬁnitely trying to get the 1argest—size shoes
that we can.” V A s

The 10 to 15 male contestants represent
various campus organizations, including
Delta Chi fraternity, the club Quidditch team,
Triangle fraternity and Brazil Nuts, a Por-
tuguese and Brazilian culture club active on
Pitt’s campus. -

They will compete in several events: atu -
of—war, a race and a pageant—like promenade,
all in their high heels.

Senior Jenna Monocello, Gamma Sigma
Sigma president, said she is excited to see

how the contestants perform.

“They’re going to be graded on poise and
grace,” Monocello said.-5‘And how many times
they trip.” .

A panel of three Gamma Sigma Sigma sis-
ters will judge participants during each event.
The winner will receive a prize of $200 to go
to the charitable organization of his choice.
A second prize of $175 will go to the charity
selected by the student organization with the
most members present at the event.

“Wall<aMile inHer Shoes” is also the name
of a national organization that hosts similar
events to raise awareness for domestic vio-
lence and violence against women.

Monocello said the Gamma Sigma Sigma
event is in no way aﬂiliated with the national
Walk a Mile in Her Shoes organization, which
helps to coordinate similar events.

She said she was not aware that the event
she was planning shared its name with the
national organization.

Monocello said she ﬁrstthought of the idea
to host the event at Pitt after meetingamem-
ber of Gamma Sigma Sigma from a different
chapter at the sorority’s national convention
in St. Louis. Other chapters of Gamma Sigma
Sigma had been putting on similar events
to raise money for the March of Dimes, and
Monocello loved the idea.

“Being a group of 200-plus girls, we all
have the real possibility of beneﬁting from

this organization,” she said. “And a lot of guys
aren’t really exposed to it. It’s going to affect
them just as much if they’re in a family. We
might as well raise awareness now and get
them thinking.”

Todd Reeser, director of the women’s stud-
ies program at Pitt, said that an event like
this highlights how our society views gender.

Reeser said that when men wear tradi-
tionally feminine clothing such as dresses or
high heels, they are affirming that they are
not like women by presenting themselves
as distinctly conuasting with the feminine
clothing. Laughter, he said, is the audience’s
way of conﬁrming the absurdity of a man in
women’s clothing.

“Gender is always complicated, and there
is no single answer to what gender in this
situation means,” Reeser said. “Needless to
say, the fact that this gendered event is for
charity means that good will be produced.”

The restaurant Chipotle will provide re-
freshments, and Oakland community organi-
zations will be present to pass out literature.
Raffle tickets will be sold for prizes includ-
ing giftbaskets and gilt cards from Maggie &
Stella’s, the University Store on Fifth and Gap.

The Pitches and Tones, an a cappella
group, will also perform at the event.

Although Tuesday night’s event will be a
ﬁistfor Pitt’s chapter of Gamma Sigma Sigma,
the sorority’s members said they hope to hold
this event armually to beneﬁt the March of
Dimes if this year’s event is a success.

Regardless of the turnout, Lopez and
Monocello said it should be a worthwhile af-
fair for the male participants. T

“I think it’s only ﬁinny because they don’t
do it,” Monocello said. “'I‘hey’re not used to
the pain inthe front ofthe shoe and the wob-
bling around. It’s just going to be funny to see
them do what we do on a regular basis.” I

cases involved individuals who had ordered
hamburgers at the restaurant. Laboratory
results also found E. coli on a sample of
meats.

The Health Department didn’t deter-
mine whether the bacteria entered the
restaurant from the supply facility or if it
spread during handling.

“It doesn’t really require knowing a
source to act,” Ritz said. “There’s this ob-
servation in the community, and there’s a
commonality. The key is to stop any source
of contamination.”

The restaurant re—opened on Oct. 31,
and no further cases have been reported.
Before being cleared to return to work,
each employee was tested for the bacteria.

EDITORIAL

A return to moderacy: What politicians
can learn from Chris Christie 2-  

Matt Barnes
For The Pitt News

On Nov. 5, Republican New
Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was
overwhelmingly re—elected as
governor of a state that only a
year ago re—elected a Democrat,
President Barack Obama. How
could this be? 0

Since he took office in Janu-
ary 2010, Christie has balanced
budgets while cutting taxes, re-
formed teacher tenure and add-
ed nearly 60,000 jobs to New

Jersey’s private sector, all while
facing a strongly Democratic
state legislature. Rather than ob-
stinately delving into the world
of bitter partisanship, Christie
vigorously reached across the
aisle to simply get things done.

Even when Governor Chris-
tie opposed a popular issue, he
still made his approach rational
and respectable. Recently, de-
spite his personal opposition to
same-sex marriage, Christie an-
nounced that he would no longer
stand in the way of its progress
in his state, a state that contrasts
the Governor’s views regarding
the matter.

Regardless of one’s stance
on same-sex marriage, it is re-
freshing to see a politician un-
derstand that there is no point
in riding a losing horse at the
expense of progress. There is no
point in stalling the progress of
one’s agenda for the sake of ob-
sessing over one issue. Christie
understands that bipartisan co-
operation is the foundation upon
which good governance is built,

’ a notion evidently supported by

the success Newjersey has real-
ized under his leadership.

The political situation in

, Washington is not as harmoni-

ous. The political partisanship of
contemporary times is despica-
ble, culminating in last month’s
government shutdown and near
debt ceiling disaster. Neither
party deserves full blame, both
are at fault here. Perhaps current
representatives have forgotten
what it means to successfully do
their jobs.

When asked to describe the
characteristics of the govern-
ment he had framed,]ames Mad-
ison replied: “Three principles
— compromise, compromise
and compromise.”

Unfortunately in recent
years, compromise has become
a dirty word in Washington, at
the expenseof the American citi-
zen. Empty words and promises
do not lead to good governance.
Inaction and stagnation do not
lead to prosperity. Petty argu-
ments do not put people back to
work. Contemptuousness does
not foster education or promote

’ general welfare.

What Christie understands
is that Americans are not pieces
waiting to be maneuvered in a
game of politics. He understands
that the job of an elected oﬂicial
is to serve the people, not the
party. Though many Republi-
can pundits criticized him for
praising Obama’s response to
Hurricane Sandy near the 2012
election, his actions should be
applauded and his character
should be admired. He is the
governor of a state and the peo-
ple of that state elected him to
represent them. His chief inter-
est should be, and seemingly is,
the welfare of his constituency.

Because of his, enormous
popularity, Christie is widely
considered a strong candidate
for president in 2016. However,
he’s avoided the discussion of
2016 and instead has shifted
his focus to his top priority:
the people of the State of New
Jersey. Of course, dodging con-
troversial national issues is a

T smartpolitical move for a po-

tential presidential candidate.
(I direct you to Obama’s senate
voting record —- you’ll notice a
lot of“presents.”) Nevertheless,
Christie genuinely delivers on
what he preaches, and should be
commended for this, no matter
what one’s feelings are toward
his actual beliefs and actions.
This. year’s gubernatorial
elections were a harbinger that
signaled the return of moderate
inﬂuence in American politics.
While Christie proved comfort-
ably victorious in a Democratic-
leaning state, Republican Ken
Cuccinelli was unable to ascend
to the governorship of Virginia,
a traditionally red state. Cucci-
nelli embodies all that Christie
isn’t — partisan, ideologically
driven and overly obstinate in
his views — all qualities thank-
fully becoming unappealing to
the American people. There is
no place for extremism and dis-
dain in our system, nor should
there be. As corroborated by
this year’s gubernatorial elec-
tion results, moving away from
the center is not the answer —
moving toward it is.
For those looking ahead, the
prospect of a Christie presiden-
tial run doesn’t seem far—fetched

and, indeed, appears likely. However,
2016 is a political lifetime away and
cannot be accurately discussed at the
present moment. But, it is not too early
to recognize the fortunate trend begin-
ning to take place in the United States.
Americans are beginning to reject the
uncompromising attitudes of both ultra-
liberals and ultra—conservatives, and are
instead welcoming moderate voices while
requiring those elected to not only talk,

but to act.
Barry Goldwater famously said, “Extrem-
ism in the defense of liberty is no vice!”
Yet, it seems that moderateness in the
name of good governance is no vice.
Americans are tired of ideologues and
rhetoric. Nearly a century ago, Warren G.
Harding campaigned on a promise of a
return to “normalcy.” Perhaps Christie, if
he indeed decides to throw his hat in the
2016 presidential ring, should promise
a‘ return to “moderacy,” a promise that
will be welcomed by all rational voters
seeking true progress in Washington.I

Joshua Steele, known in the dubstep world as Flux Pavilion, is an English producer
and DJ. Steele is known best for both his original compositions and for his bass-
heavy adaptations of hit pop and hip hop songs.

Among the endless crowd surﬁng, beer—throwing, head—bobbing and shirtless
fans in attendance, security had its hands full. More than a few listeners were taken
from the crowd and ejected from the venue through the photography pit, which
only furthered the chaos created by fans who had fought their way to the front rows.

The performance of Flux Pavi1ion’s 2011 track “I Can’t Stop,” which was sampled
on]ay—Z and Kanye West’s Watch the Throne, sent fans into an even deeper frenzy
of jumping, singing and dancing. Even a broken arm was not enough to negate the
vibrating ‘effect Steele had on his adoring fan base.

Booming speakers, intense lights and lasers, hurled beer bottles and an 8—foot—
long “Flux Pavilion” light-up logo combined into a sensory overload that no doubt
impressed the entire crowd. E

Banjo playing draws an age-diverse '

crowd to the Northside on Wednesday
nights. Nikki Moriello | Multimedia Editor

In 1976, Frank Rossi joined an organiza-
tion that _had one goal: the preservation
of America’s instrument —— the banjo.

It is no surprise that Rossi’s very own
Pittsburgh Banjo Club shares the same
goal, 37 years after Rossi started playing
the instrument. But Rossi’s club has been
able to do something that most other
banjo clubs around the country haven’t:
get the youth of the city to come out to
rehearsals.

Drawn to the lively sound of the four-
string banjo, Rossi took to the instru-
ment immediately. The passion he devel-
oped while playing with the Long Island
Banjo Society in New York inspired him
to start a similar organization when he
relocated to Pittsburgh in 1988. The
Pittsburgh Banjo Club, however, is far
from the typical banjo club you will ﬁnd
in most American cities.

Five or six years ago, young music
lovers from Pittsburgh’s up—and—com-
ing neighborhoods discovered that the
dining room of Elks Lodge #339 on
the North Side was the place to be on
Wednesday nights. The sound of doz-
ens of four— and six—string banjos being

picked in unison could be heard as you

entered the room. The long tables are

mostly full, with those in front tapping
their feet and singing along, as those in

On this particular Wednesday night, The

the game was all but drowned out by the

crowd were not only the old — those

20-somethings made up a sizable part of
the Wednesday night audience.

BANJO

“There’s banjo clubs like this around
the country, but none of them meet in
an atmosphere like this. They meet at
senior citizen places or church halls, or
places not open to the public,” Rossi, of
Ambridge, Pa., said. For Rossi, the lively
sound of the banjo is what makes it so
special. “It’s America’s instrument,” he
said, proudly.

The banjo originated hundreds of

years ago on the African continent. Ac-
cording to Rossi, African slaves brought
the instrument to America during the
colonial period. By the early 1800s, some
white people were learning to play.

In the Civil War era, some musicians
shifted from the old style of playing
chords and began fingerpicking the
banjo. This was probably influenced by
the popular guitar method of the time.
Eventually, the banjo spread to the Ap-
palachian region of the U.S. and beyond.
When the Roaring ’2os rolled around,

TD34 pm.

young adults began taking to the banjo.

“Colleges before the 192 OS, 1930s, al-
ways had glee clubs. They also had banjo
clubs and mandolin clubs. A lot of old-
time doctors and other old-timers play

the banjo, because they played it while:

they were in college,” Rossi said.

The Pittsburgh Banjo Club is not just a
bunch of old-timers, however. The ages of
club members range from 13 to 95. Rossi

and his contingent of banjo, trumpet, .

tuba and bass players delight audiences
with Tin Pan Alley folk tunes, Americana,

Dixieland and polka melodies.
“Frank [Rossi] really makes it
unique,” said ].T. Chiodi, president of

a the Pittsburgh Banjo Club. “It’s rehearsal

in the beginning, for a little bit, but Frank
really runs it like a show.”

For Chiodi, the Pittsburgh Banjo Club
has become a family affair. His two sons
started singing onstage with the club at
ages 3 and 4.

In addition to rehearsals every

lWed‘nesday,.the club does about 30 per-

formances each year in the Pittsburgh

‘area. The club has played at Kennywood

Park, art_show_s, antique shows and com-

- l.g‘}imunityfgce_nters.. Prior to practic‘ifig;"'at

the'E’lks Lodge, the_'Pittsburgh Banjo
Club met at the James StreetiTaVv'ern on
the North Shore (now theJames Street
Gastropuband Speakeasy) for 13 years.

Rossi is most fond of the club’s;.cur—
rent location, however. “We lovevthis
place because it’s air-conditioned [and

-has] very few steps,” Rossi said. “It’s a

great venue for us because it, attracts

. everybody.”

_ Whether thelinjiectionh of youth into
the club was‘ caused by the populariza-

tion of the banjo ‘by folk-pop bands,

such as the Avett Brothers and Mum-
ford and Sons, or the atmosphere at the
Elks Lodge is hard to tell. Regardless,
the young intermingle with the old in a
remarkable way at banjo club rehearsals.

“What I like about this is it’s very au-
thentic. Especially for my generation,
irony is sort of the hip thing, and this is
the opposite of ironic. People are here
because they want to hear good music.
They want to have a good time. It’s just a
very genuine atmosphere,” said Lauren
Knapp, a 29-year-old freelance writer
who recently, moved to Pittsburgh.

“It’s multigenerational,” said Matt
Pickart-, 28. “I live in Lawrenceville and
the hipsters are all over it. [In Lawrencev-
ille] it’s a thing, you gotta go to banjo
night.” ’

Word of the club has spread through .

what is considered a relatively “un-hip”
medium these days: word of mouth. But.

Rossi isn’t surprised of the club’s new-
found popularity. Ultimately, it’s the mu-
sic that draws in the crowds.

“They love the music, they’ve never
heard it before. This is happy, lively mu-
sic, and they’re beginning to really like
it,” said Rossi. I

Chryst credits offensive line for win,

  Iooksfonivard to UNC

Dame. Ben Brownlee | Senior Staff Photographer

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Fresh off the signature win of Paul
Chryst’s young tenure as Pitt’s
head coach, the Panthers now
begin preparation for Saturday’s
game against North Carolina at
Heinz Field. The Panthers are
one win away from bowl eligibil-
ity after their 28-21‘ upset of No.
23 Notre Dame.

Chryst said the win last Sat-
urday was largely a byproduct
of consistent play all around the
ﬁeld.

“I thought we did some good
things up front,” Chryst said. “It
wasn’t all of a sudden this great
transformation. We. just made
some plays — for different rea-

I sons the O—line was a big part of

it.”
As a result of the offensive
line’s play, quarterback Tom Sav-

age threw for 243 yards and two
touchdowns and freshman run-
ning backjames Conner was able
to convert two goal-line carries
into touchdowns.

“We were able to get some run-
game going,” Chryst said. “Tommy
[Savage] did a good job  of get-
ting the ball out of his hands, he
found some checkdowns, espe-
cially early. I think there’s a lot of
reasons why we were able to be
successful offensively.”

Ryan Schlieper, who started
at left guard the past few weeks
because of an injury to Cory King,
said that the line has simply im-
proved with time. That was em-
bodied in this weekend’s results:
Savage enduredjust one sack Sat-

. urday, in stark contrast to contests

against Virginia and Virginia Tech.

“I don’t know if you can say
better, but deﬁnitely more expe-
rienced,” Schlieper said. “Every

0 Savage (7) enrd us oe sack Saturday, leading to a breakout performance against Notre

game you get more and more ex-
perience and more knowledge.
You understand the game better.”

Beyond the statistical perfor-
mance, Chryst also credited Sat-
urday’s sellout crowd of 65,500
for spurring the Panthers’ spirits.

“The atmosphere was one heck
of an atmosphere,” Chryst said. “I
know our kids got a lot of energy
from it.”

Moving forward, Pitt (5-4, 2-3
ACC) has a chance to catch the Tar
Heels (4-5, 3-3 ACC) in the Coastal
Division standings. North Caro-
lina is ahead of Pitt by a half—game
entering this week’s matchup.

“Just watching North Carolina,
I see an extremely talented team,”
Chryst said. “They’re athletic and
on a bit of a roll.” ’

Chryst is right.

After a 1-5 start, the Tar Heels

vi/Vheni Derrick Randall found out

that his ﬁrst game with Pitt would
also be his ﬁrst start at Pitt, his
focus didn’t change.

“Just go out and give it my all
and just do everything right,” Ran-
dall said.

As the largest player on the.’

ﬂoor against Savarmah State, Ran-
dall used his 6-foot—9, 240 -pound
frame to haul in 12 rebounds -

' . eight off the offensive side —- and

score 12 points for a double—double
in his Pitt debut. The spot start
for Randall came about because
redshirt senior center Talib Zarma
was serving a one—game suspen-
sion for an unspeciﬁed violation
of team rules. _

But Randall took advantage of
the opportunity and showed what
he was capable of doing.

“‘D’ is a force down low,” said
redshirt senior, Lamar Patterson,
of Randall’s performance “That’s
what we expect from him.”

A transfer from Rutgers, Ran-
dall wasn’t the only new face to
contribute to Pitt’s 88-55 win Fri-
day against Savannah State.

Head coachJamie Dixon ﬁnds
half of his rebounding and scoring
production from last year gone

3 because of transfers, graduation

and Steven Adams’ departure to
the NBA. The burden to replace
that statistical output lies on the
shoulders of a group of players
who played their ﬁrst games as
Panthers Friday.

“We’re going to play some
freshmen,” Dixon said. “I have

conﬁdence in them.”

‘ That group includes fresh‘-
men such as Michael Young, Josh
Newkirk and Jamel Artis. But Pitt
will also rely on the efforts of
newcomers such as Randall and
evenJosh K0 and Chrisjones, who
played a combined 18 minutes Fri-
day.

Led by Randall’s double-dou-
ble, the aforementioned group

collectively posted 42 points and
27, rebounds. The point total was
just under half the Panthers’ 88
total points, while the rebound-
ing accounted for over half their
47 boards. It was a good start for
a group that needs to consistently
produce.

“The new guys played great,”
Patterson said. ‘josh played great,
shot the ball well, ran the team
well. Mike andjamel played well,
so they got a lot of good practice
for it, with our early practices we
had going on, the early workouts
—— so they’re playing great right
now.”

Newkirk ﬁnished with 11 points
on 4-of-6 shooting and proved
more than capable of backing up
sophomore point guard James
Robinson, at least for one night.
Most impressive about Newkirk,
who stressed the need for an im-
proved jump shot, was his 3-for-3
shooting from 3-point range.

“I’ve just been in the gym work-
ing on it and when I get the op-
portunity, I make the most of it,”
he said of his long-range marks-
manship.

Young also started in his ﬁrst

have won three games in a row. Their latest
triumph came Saturday against Virginia,
when North Carolina soundly defeated the
Cavaliers, 45-14. But the Tar Heels are also
missing starting quarterback Bryn Renner,
who is sidelined for the rest of the season
with a separated shoulder.

“They’ve still got a big offensive line.
Their tight end is a heck of a player,” Chryst

said. “They have a number of skilled receiv-
ers that, no matter who’s playing quarter-
back, they’re dangerous.”

The tight end Chryst refers to is Eric
Ebron, whose name circulated as a pre-
season All—American at the position. The
junior has recorded 46 receptions for 690
yards and three scores this season.

Ebron is ranked as the best tight end in
the 2014 NFL Draft class by draft scouts,
and may merit a ﬁrst-round selection in
April.

Surrounding Ebron is Quinshad Davis,

who leads the team with eight touchdown
receptions, and Bug Howard, who has
scored four times. ’ "

Out of the backﬁeld, Chryst still sees
quarterback Marquise Williams as a threat
both through the air and on the ground.
Against Virginia, Williams threw for 185
yards and two touchdowns while rushing
for another 46 yards and a score.

“I’ve just been starting to watch [tape],
but he’s athletic, I think he’s got a live arm,”
Chryst said. “Obviously, they trust him quite
a bit, and I think he’s got good Weapons

around him. I think he’s dangerous.”

Ray Vinopal, named the ACC Defensive
Player of the Week for his two-interception
performance against Notre Dame, is con-
cerned only about preparing himself and
the rest of his team, regardless of what
position Williams or any player holds on
the depth chart.

“We’re just worrying about ourselves,”
Vinopal said. “We’re going to get into game
preptoday, but all these teams have great

athletes. Whether it’s ﬁrst string or third ’

string, they have capable players.”

As for Pitt’s offensive line, the challeng-
es North Carolina poses are of a different
breed than those posed last week by behe-
moth All-American tackle Louis Williams
and the rest of Notre Dame’s defensive line.

“I haven’t seen any tape yet on North
Carolina,” Schlieper said. “I talked to coach
[Jim] Hueber and he said they’re a faster
team.” '

Pitt enters the game with ﬁve wins, and
can nearly taste the fruits that bowl eligi-
bility will yield with the team’s sixth win.

“You play for the postseason whenever

' you’re in the season,” Vinopal said. “The
goal is to make a bowl and play in the best
bowl you can.”

After nine games, Pitt is predicted to
visit the Hyundai Sun Bowl, according to
ESPN’s ACC blog.

Schlieper said. “If we can get four, that’s a
whole different world.” I I

regular season game and chipped in nine
points and eight rebounds. Artis was the
ﬁrst man off the bench Friday and added
four points and ﬁve boards.

While Dixon relied primarily on two
freshmen last season in Robinson and Ad-
ams, this year will require his trust not only
in three freshmen, but also players such
as Randall and Jones, who hadn’t played

in a regular season game for Dixon before
Friday.

At the early stages, inexperience doesn’t
seem to be something with which Dixon is
concerned, let alone keen on making ex-
cuses to cover.

“We can’t point to it,” Dixon said. “I’ve
never done it and I’m not going to start this
year.” I
