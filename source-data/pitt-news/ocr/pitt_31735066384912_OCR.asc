freshmen

By Scot Ross

News Editor

Organized by the Office of Stu-
dent Activities and held in Forbes
Quadrangle, the 1988 Student
Activities Fair was held yesterday,
giving incoming freshmen as well
as interested upperclassmen the
opportunity to gain information
about the vast number of clubs
and organizations at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.

The availability of the
students is the key
here. Get the freshmen
when they're ready to

go.
— lames Raymond

ll

Groups represented at the fair
included the Society for a Crea-
tive Anachronism, Students for
Life, Dance Ensemble and the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance.

The assistant director of Student
Activities, James Raymond, said
that 135 organizations signed up
to participate in the annual event,
which coincides with the com-
pletion of freshman orientation.

Crews fighting forest fires
gained ground Tuesday in Yel-
lowstone National Park,
although fire blocked a plan to
reopen the south entrance.
Due to this incident, the Forest
Service went to employment
offices in the West in search of
more firefighters.

National Guardsmen in Ida-
ho were sent to the firelines,
and Wyoming Guard volun-
teers were sent for fire training.

A remote California town
mopped up after lightning-
sparked blazes swept within
feet of the community and
forced evacuation of the town
hospital for several hours.

Firefighters were at work
against fires charring wood-
land in Wyoming, California,
Montana, Idaho, Oregon,
Washington and Utah. And

dozens of fires have been al-
lowed to smolder for months
in the vast interior of Alaska.

Nationally, 18,000 firefight-
ers were on the job in one of
the nation's worst fire years,
reported the Boise |nteragen-
cy Fire Center, a central office
in Idaho that coordinates the
fighting of forest fires in the
West.

To date, 3.4 million acres of
forest have burned, slightly
ahead of last year's pace, but
2.1 million of that total is in
Alaska, where 30 fires smol-
dered Tuesday, the center
reported.

The fire center told Forest
Service regions affected by the
fires that temporary firefighters
may be hired on a contingen-
cy basis for about $7 an hour,

mel of Missoula, Mont.

Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus
placed his entire state under

New Armenian room
opens in Cathedral

By Mindy Boffemmyer

News Editor

After 10 years of design, con-
struction and other preparation,
the Armenian Nationality Class-
room is ready for the public eye.

The new nationality room is lo-
cated at room number 319 in the
Cathedral of Learning.

The Armenian Room officially
took its place among the 20 other
nationality rooms of the
Cathedral at its dedication on
Aug. 29.

Archbishop Torkom Manoo-
gian, Primate, Diocese of the
Armenian Church of America,
performed the blessing. Manoo-
gian is one of the world's fore-
most Armenian clergymen.

The room's design is based on
an 11th century library,_in‘t_he

monastery of Sanahin, Armenia
and is constructed entirely of
stone. Torkom Khrimian, a gradu-
ate of the Polytechnic Institute of
Yerevan, Armenia, U.S.S.R., is
the new nationality room's ar-
chitect and designer.

”The dramatic sweep of a
2,000 year history is evident in
the Armenian Nationality
Room,” said E. Maxine Bruhns,
director of the Nationality Rooms
Program. ”An architectural jewel,
enhanced by delicate stone and
wood carvings, proves worthy of
Armenia, the world's oldest
Christian nation."

An Armenian Nationality Class-
room Committee was established
by the Armenian-American Club
of Pittsburgh in 1978.

‘THE PirrNEws,wedoesaoy, August 31. 1988

 

PHILADELPHIA (AP)— A Tem-
ple University professor is de-

-veloping a one-legged, hopping

robot that may one day be used
by soldiers for reconnaissance.

The robot should be able to
move through a hostile environ-
ment while avoiding enemy fire
and physical obstacles, according
to Temple associate professor Dr.
John Helferty.

Helferty said his robot's
processing system is similar to
how neurons operate in the hu-

_ man brain.

The system, called an artificial
neural network, is a recent de-
velopment in computer science.
The network consists of large, in-
terconnecting groups of simple
computing devices, each adding
incoming signals from the others
before a decision is made.

The system is ideal for jobs re-

quiring visual pattern recogni-
tion, he said. Its ability to learn on
its own gives it the potential to
perform complex tasks.

The system is ideal for artificial
intelligence applications, Helferty
said, because it bypasses the limi-
tation inherent to standard com-
puter chips, which are unable to
work on a problem in any way
other than by processing bits of
data one by one.

He has applied to the U.S.
Army Research Office and the
National Science Foundation for
funds to build the robot and ex-
pects to have a working model
prepared sometime next year.

time of the year. Usually, I work
seven days a week, especially
during football season. Through-
out the weekdays, I get to work
at six. Monday is my day to see
patients. Usually, I see 60 to 80
patients on Monday. Afterwards,
I will go to the stadium to see the
players and trainers. Wednesdays
are similar to Mondays. Through-
out the weekdays, I get to work
at six. Tuesdays and Fridays are
my days to operate. The number
of operations vary from six to IO
each day. Finally, Thursday is my
day to do research. Also on
Thursdays, I see patients at the
Student Health Service at Pitt.
During the football season, Satur-
days are spent at the stadium.
Sunday mornings I go to see the
athletes at Mt. Lebanon High
School, and then I come back to
see more Pitt athletes.

Q: How do you have time to
see 60 to 80 patients on Mondays
and Wednesdays?

Fu: Most people that I see have
a specific injury, and it does not
take a long time to examine.
Also, many patients I have al-
ready seen before, and they are
just coming back so I can make
sure their progress is adequate.

Q: How much would it cost a
person to be examined in your
Falk Clinic?

Fu: Actually, this is quite ex-
pensive. There is an Initial fee of
$65. I do, however, see students
at the Student Health Office on
Thursdays. For many students this
is part of their health plan. If it is
possible, I will try not to charge
people who cannot afford to pay,
but it is not always In mv Dower

Fu: Yes, I am always very close
to the field during all of the foot-
ball games. If someone gets hurt

A scale model of the famed bat-
tleship U.S. Brig Niagara is on ex-
hibit in Mellon Bank's Union
Trust Building lobby to com-
memorate the 175th anniversary
of the U.S. victory in the Battle of
Lake Erie —— the bloodiest naval
battle of the War of 1812.

The model, which is eight feet
high and nine feet wide, is en-
cased in glass and was built by
Timothy Cole. Cole used plans
drawn by Melvourne Smith, who
was commissioned to restore the
original vessel. The model will be
housed in the lobby of the Mel-
Ion Center building at 501 Grant
Street as part of a series of
celebrations. . A

”The scale model is a visual
reminder, not only of this impor-
tant anniversary, but also of the
sense of community and patri-
otism surrounding the celebration
of this historic event," said San-
dra J. McLaughlin, senior vice
president and head of Mellon
Bank Corporation's Corporate Af-
fairs Group.

The celebrations began earlier

this month in -Erie, Pennsylvania 1

with the 13th annual “We Love "
Erie Days” festival.

The centerpiece of the Erie
celebration was the U.S. Brig
Niagara, which was rebuilt to ac-
tual sailing specifications on Er-

Campus security offers safety suggestions for Oakland

By Tarun Reddy
Staff Writer

Perhaps one facet of college life
which many freshmen fail to ap-
preciate is the subject of campus
security. More importantly, how
incoming students can make sure
they are not victims of crime;
whether it be in the dorms, aca-
demic buildings, or on the streets
of Oakland.

So what can new students do
to make sure they are not the next

victims of crime?

According to Charles Greer, as-
sistant director of campus securi-
ty, some simple practices can
help immensely in the prevention
of crime.

”As far as students’ dorm be-
longings, they should make it a
habit to lock their doors

whenever they leave the
premises, even if it's for only a
short while,” said Greer.

Campus phones are situated in
front of most of the academic
buildings and provide them quick
access to campus police. These
phones should be used to report
any medical emergencies or any
suspicious activity.

’’If a person has reason to be-
lieve an unauthorized individual
is in a particular area, the authori-
ties should be contacted immedi-
ately,” Greersaid. ’

As far as the number of report-
ed crimes on campus is con-
cerned, Greer indicated that there
has been a small decline in the
number of crimes. committed
within the university. Greer at-
tributed the decline to common
sense among students. He cited

people walking in groups as the
most effective means of safety
while walking tk streets at night.

If there has been one part of
Oakland which has received the
greatest _attention from campus as
well as city police, it is the inter-
section of Forbes Avenue and
Bouquet Street.

’’In response to incidents
which occurred in 1986, we de-
veloped a plan with city police to
help expedite the pedestrian
traffic in this corridor,” said
Greer.

The plan involved the deploy-

Chemical use augments greenhouse

WASHINGTON (AP)—- A
group of climate researchers has
warned that the”greenhouse ef-
fect” warming of the Earth will
continue even if there are sharp
cutbacks in the use of the chemi-
cals which‘ cause the problem.

The heatup ”appears to be in-
evitable, even with  drastic, and
probably unrealistic reductions,
of greenhouse forcing” by the
release of carbon dioxide and
other gases, the scientists report-
ed in the journal of Geophysical
Research—Atmospheres.

The group, led by James Han-

 sen of the National Aeronautical

and Space,’ Administration,
reached that conclusion after run-
ning computerized climate
models in an effort to predict the
climate in the future.

The models looked at the effect
of chemical releases at three
different levels: continuing rapid
release ofthe chemicals, as in re-
cent years; release at slower rates,
and a drastic cutback in those
chemicals. ’

In the first case, the Earth's
average temperature was calcu-
lated to rise by 1.6 degrees
Fahrenheit within 20 years.

It would take 2,5,", years for that.,.

increase in théisecond model.

.  A.nd even with the-clrasticaai-and .
probably unrealistic” cutback in '

chemical releases,-. the tempera-

 ture would rise that muﬁh even-
tually, and probably would climb

by 0.8 degrees within 15 years,
according to the study.

The greenhouse effect has
drawn increasing concern recent-
ly, although most meteorologists
contend that it is too early to de-

term i-ne.i.fi,t_ is responsible for the;
current drought and hot weather

affecting much of the nation.

It occurs when carbon dioxide,
largely from burning fossil fuels,
and other gases — such as
methane and nitrogen oxides —
increases in the atmosphere.
These gases let incoming heat
from the sun reach the Earth, but
they block the Earth's own heat
from-traveling into space, ;muq’h
as a greenhouse traps heat in-
doors. As the gases become more
abundant, more heat is trapped
and the planet's temperature
rises.

The National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration report-
ed late Tuesday that global
concentrations of carbon dioxide
have increased by 25 percent
since the mid-1800s. .

Pieter.P. Tans of NOAA’s.Boul-

dear, Colo., laboratoriessaid con-

centrations of the gas now top

350 parts per million in the at-
mosphere, up from about 280
parts per million in the mid-to
late-19th century. Analysis of air

tle if any -change in carbon diox-
ide for" many centuries before that
time.

Hansen told a congressional
subcommittee earlier in the sum-
mer that the current hot, dry con-
ditions are an example of things
to come. ’

In particular, he noted in the
new report that, while the aver-

mers. The chances of any partic-
ular summer being hotter than
normal would top 50 percent,
compared to a 33 percent chance
in the past.

the block decreased dramatical-
ly, according to Greer.

The campus police force con-
sists of 95 uniformed and 15
plain-clothed officers, a figure
which is average for an institution
of Pitt's size.

Another area of concern which
will receive greater attention is
the activity in and around the
William Pitt Student Union,
where a shooting and stabbing
occurred last year during two stu-
dent functions.

”We will increase our monitor-
ing efforts in the union to prevent
such incidents from happening
again,” said Greer. 1

Another area which will
receive increased police attention

is the area in and around Pitt
Stadium. In addition to providing
increased manpower, the lighting
on the streets flanking the stadi-
um will be increased.

So, is there any particular goal
campus police hope to achieve
for 1988?

’’Ultimately, the only goal
which really interests campus
police is satisfying the needs of
the community in and around the
university- Hopefully, students
will continue to increase their
awareness of their surroundings
at night, and additionally, we

[campus police] can continue to .

gain a better understanding with
the residents within the universi-
ty community.”

OP?‘ ‘“

Jon Wells/Pitt News

Students got a chance to talk to various campus organizations yesterday at the annual Student Activities Fair.

Continued from page 1

Raymond said, ”At least 3,000
[people attended], we've been
trying to figure. At least three or
four thousand, I would imagine.”

He explained that, because of
the several entrances into the
Quad, there is no way to ac-
curately calculate the actual num-
ber.

He noted, though, that the laid-

. back setting and the easy acces-

sibility of the fair allowed stu-
dents ”to come through and iust

see what's going on or come in
and stay all day.”

Raymond said the purpose of
the fair is to allow clubs and stu-
dents to make contact with one
another.

He added, ”We get different
responses from different types of
groups. The thing is, the students
at this time of the year are really
ready to get involved, and if you
want to find some students, this
would be the place to do it. it de-
pends on the follow—up the or-

ganizations do.

”The availability of the students
is the key thing here. Get the
freshmen when they're ready to
go, plus the upperclassmen
who've come back are ready to
get involved now, and this is the
first time to bring them together.”

With the overwhelming turn-
out the past few years, Raymond
said Student Activities may look
into the possibility of . moving
next year's fair to the William Pitt
Union.

This overwhelming response is
generated right back into the Pitt
clubs and organizations. Bob
Boucher, who sat at the fraterni-
ty table, said the Greeks use the
fair as an opportunity to have
registration for fall rush as well as
to show the Greeks are part of
Pitt, rather than a separate part of
the college. Panther Prints said
they use the fair for its free ex-
posure, and that it is a chance to
sign up new staff members.

Walesa meeting with Polish officials to end strike

GDANSK, Poland (AP) -
Solidarity founder Lech Walesa
will hold his first talks with the
Polish leadership in six years
Wednesday, in a government ef-
fort to end two weeks of labor tur-
moil, his advisers said.

Walesa will confer in Warsaw
with Interior Minister Czeslaw
Kiszczak at a meeting attended
by a representative of the Roman
Catholic Church but will not call
off the strike at his shipyard.in
Gdansk, the advisers said.

A communique from the Com-
munist Party's ruling Politburo,
distributed by the official news
agency PAP, mentioned a round-
table meeting, endorsed it and
said Kiszczak should ”carry on
with the mission entrusted to
him.”

It was not clear, however,
whether the reference was to the
Wednesday meeting or the
minister's original proposal on
Friday. No other official reference
was made to the Wa|esa—Kiszczak
talks.

Ten enterprises in Poland re-
mained on strike Tuesday. At its
height, the current labor trouble
involved 20 sites employing
100,000 people and was the
worst since 1980.

. Solidarity spokesmen said there
was no agreement for an immedi-
ate end to the strikes, in which a
central demand has been making
Solidarity legal again. It was sup-
pressed after the declaration of
martial law in December 1981
and outlawed in 1982.

On Tuesday evening, Walesa
left the strikebound Lenin ship-
yard, where he works as an elec-
trician, to confer with advisers
and Bishop Tadeusz.Goclowski
at nearby St. Brygida’s church.
He emerged from the rectory
with the bishop later to cheers
and chants from supporters.

He said Walesa would attend
the Wednesday meeting as presi-
dent of the Independent Self-
Governing Trade Union Solidar-
ity, the labor federation’s full
name.

While the government ex-
pressed its willingness to talk,
strikers at the Stalowa Wola steel
mill in southeastern Poland said
soldiers had moved into the
town, and helicopters flew over
the plant.

Workers are occupying the
shipyard and steel mill, as is cus-
tomary during strikes in Poland.

In a reference to the Stalowa
Wola strike, Kiszczak’s ministry
and the armed forces general staff
issued a statement saying: ”ln
case of the continuation of the
illegal strike action, appropriate
lawful measures will be taken.”

ing matured man is even harder,”
Gul Mohammad said in his
whispery voice as he counted
coins and handed sweets to chil-
dren much taller than he.

Mohammad is 3.3 inches short-
er than the shortest living adult
listed by the 1988 Guinness Book
of Records, Nelson de la Rosa of
Santo Domingo, Dominican
Republic.

’’I want to marry someone who
is of normal height so that she can
carry me around, feed me and
give me a bath.  I do not want
to live on the charity of my rela-
tives forever,” he said.

His arms are so short that his
hands ”can’t reach his head
while bathing,” said his aunt,
Nargis Begum. -

’’I could not do anything. I
have decided when I marry I will
ask my wife to sit with me in the
candy store,” he said with a
broad smile.

”Being the shortest man is not

a joke. It is a hard existence,”
Mohammad said.

Bridge collapses in
Germany, one dies

ASCHAFFENBURC, West Ger-
many (AP) — A bridge under con-
struction collapsed into the Main
River on Tuesday, killing one
worker and injuring six others,
police said.

Seven men were trapped in
iron debris from the collapsed
span, police said. They were
pulled from the debris and taken
to hospitals by helicopter.

One of the workers died of his
injuries shortly after being admit-
ted. The others did not suffer life-
threatening injuries.

Police gave no further details
on the accident.

Aschaffenburg is located about
25 miles east of Frankfurt.

Three locals injured
at airshow accident

RAMSTEIN, West Germany (AP)

 

— An Air Force sergeant from Bu-
tler County, his wife and their
1-year-old son were among those
injured when a jet crashed into
the crowd at an aviation exhibi-
tion in West Germany.

Sgt. Jeffrey McCanch, 23, of
Marwood, was attending Sun-
day's air show at the U.S. Air
Force Base in Ramstein, West
Germany, where he is stationed,
with his wife, Tammy, 23, and
their son, Jeffrey Jr., the officer's
parents said Monday from their
Marwood home. They were sit-
ting 30 feet from where the jet
crashed.

Forty—six people were killed,
and scores of others suffered crit-
ical burns.

George and Beverly McCanch
said their son and daughter—in—
law were hospitalized in West
Germany with minor burns but
were expected to be released
later this week.

The baby suffered burns over
20 percent to 50 percent of his
body and was hospitalized in crit-
ical condition,

you need specific exercises. For
example, a quarterback would
need special shoulder stretches.
The dancers in the Pittsburgh
Ballet Theater receive a total flex-
ibility profile so we know exact-
ly how loose they are.

Q: What is your connection
with the Pittsburgh Marathon?

Fu: About five years ago, I be-
came the medical doctor for the
marathon. Essentially, it was a
very difficult task because I had
no idea about running a sports
marathon. A few staff members
went to New York and Boston to
discuss how to run a marathon.
We actually have one of the best
marathon medical set—ups in the
country, because we have a very
good medical personnel to run-
ner ratio.

Q: How are you able to han-
dle medical emergencies during
the marathon?

Fu: We organized a complete
medical team which includes
podiatrists, trainers, massage peo-
ple, nurses, respiratory therapists,
orthopedic doctors and emergen-
cy medicine doctors. We have
about 20 medical tents. In the first
10 miles, there is a medical tent
every two miles. After that there
is a tent each mile. Also, after 15
miles there is a mini-hospital ev-
ery mile. A group of us meet ev-
ery two weeks throughout the
whole year to discuss how the
medical aspect of the marathon
will be handled.

Q: What do you do for ex-
ercize?

Fu: I play tennis, basketball,
and IskL

Q: What type of research do
you do?

Fu: I do research on knees and
shoulders. Right now, we are
building a biomedical-robotic
model of the human shoulder.
This is the first one in the world.

Q: Would you allow an under-
graduate to do research with
you?

Fu: I think he or she would
have to be highly motivated. I
would not want someone to
come in and waste my time just
so they could write my name
down on their resume. I want
people hard working and
dedicated.

Q: What is the future for sports
medicine in Pittsburgh?

Fu: Well, sports medicine is
new to Pittsburgh. I really started
Pittsburgh's sports medicine pro-
gram. In the future, I think the
program will turn even more aca-
demic and more research
oriented.

Q: What should students do to
keep in shape?

Fu: People should exercise at
least three times a week. Swim-
ming is good, so is running.
Women must worry about proper
iron amounts. A lot of warm—ups
and flexibility is necessary. Peo-
ple about 40 should see a doctor
before they start an exercise pro-
gram to make sure their heart and
lungs are working properly.

Commerce Index drop concerns economists

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ ‘The
government said Tuesday its chief
forecasting gauge of future eco-
nomic activity suffered the
steepest drop in eight months in
July, but few analysts expect a
substantial slackening in growth
‘anytime soon. ’

The 0.8 percent decline in the
Commerce Department's Index
of Leading Economic Indicators
was the biggest since last Novem-
ber, when the index dropped 1.0
percent in the aftermath of the
October stock market crash.

However, economists noted
that the index posted an excep-
tionally strong increase in June
and cautioned against reading
too much into a one—month
downturn. I

In a separate report, the Com-
merce Department said orders to

U.S. factories for manufactured
goods plunged 3.5 percent in
July, the worst decline in 18
months. But that drop followed a
very strong showing in June and
was heavily influenced by a wide
swing in orders for military
equipment.

The economy, as. measured by

at a 3.3 percent annual rate in the
three months endingin June and
at a 3.4 percent pace in the first
quarter.

White House spokesman B. Jay
Cooper, in California with the
vacationing President Reagan,
said, ”The data suggest continued
economic growth in the months
ahead,» although at a more
moderate ‘pace than in the first
half” of the year.

However, the very strength that

dispelled financial markets’ wor-
ries about a recession is fueling
concern that the economy is ex-
panding at a too—rapid pace that
will lead to faster inflation.

In an effort to easeinflationary
pressures, the Federal Reserve
Board has been attempting to
dampen economic growth by
pushing up short—term interest
rates since late March. On Aug.
9, it took its most dramatic

.inf|ation—fighting move by raising

the discount rate, its key bank
lending rate, by a half percentage
point.

man of the Wefa Group, a Bala

Construction of the new na-

1987.
The dedication ceremony on

0 Aug. 8 included remarks from Pitt

President Wesley Posvar, who
was then presented with a
ceremonial key symbolizing the

‘transfer of the room from the
'. Armenian community to the

university.

« There are currently three more
nationality rooms being planned,
including the Ukrainian, African
Heritage and Austrian
classrooms.

The Armenian Room is the se-

cond nationality room to be dedi-
cated in 30 years. The Israel
Heritage Classroom was dedicat-
ed in November of 1987.

The Armenian classroom is the
only nationality room to be con-
structed completely of stone, In-
diana limestone. It features a
yertik, a simulated opening to the
sky. It is the only known structure
based on 10th-12th century ar-
chitecture outside of historic
Armenia in the U.S.S.R.

The new classroom features a
basalt cornerstone from the Sana-
hin and a stone khatchkar, or

.cross, which were gifts from the

Armenian government. Etched
above the khatchkar is the date,
”301 A.D.”, which is the year
Armenia adopted Christianity, the
first nation to do so.

A Heritage Wall is also featured 7

in the Armenian Room.

However, bond and stock
traders had been anticipating the
declines, and the markets

, showed little reaction in trading
Tuesday.

In July, the weakness in the

leading indicators was

widespread, with seven of the
available nine components
registering declines. ,

The biggest drain came from an
11.3 percentjump in unemploy-
ment claims. Without that, the
overall retreat of the index would
have been only about 0.4
percent.

Other negative factors, in ord-

er of severity-, were a drop in new -

orders for consumer goods; a
decline in building permits; a
speedup ‘in business deliveries,

considered a sign of slackening-

demand; a drop in the Standard

& Poor’s index of 500 stocks; an '
inflation-adjusted contraction of

the money supply; and a slight
drop in plant and equipment
orders.

_ One indicator, a rise in prices
for raw materials, was read as a

sign of economic strength. The
length of the average work week
was unchanged in July.

The 0.8 percent overall decline

left the index at 192.1 percent of v

its 1967 base of 100.

The dip followed a 1.4 percent
jump in the index in June, the
biggest since December 1986.
The index was off a revised 0.7
percent in May.

Economists use the leading in-
dex. as an advance ‘signal of a
recession. It has declined three
times in a row six to nine months
in advance of all eight recessions
since 1948. However, on four oc-
casions the _index has declined
three months in a row, and only
slower growth but no recession
followed. —

later months. For instance, within

The PLO should be
allowed to be heard

In a fit of clear thinking, President Reagan has decided against ap-
pealing the decision of a Federal District judge which will allow the
Palestine Liberation Organization to maintain a non-voting, observ-
er mission at the U.N. Since 1974, when.PLO leader Yassir Arafat
addressed the assembly, the mission has been a point of contention

for the U.S.

‘ Some people, including Vice Presidential nominee J. Danforth
Quayle, have identified the PLO as a terrorist organization which
should not be permitted to enter the U.S. One major stumbling block,
however, has been the 1947 U.N. host agreement prohibiting Ameri-
ca from denying access to members of that body. At present, all PLO

officials but one (who is a U.S. citizen) are restricted from traveling

more than 25 miles outside New York city limits. _

It seems the better part of ration for the United States to continue
its recognition of the PLO U.N. mission. Since King Hussien of Jor-
dan relinquished Palestinian sovereignty to the PLO earlier this sum-
mer, the place of that organization in the world power structure has
changed. I

Justice Department officials have indicated a desire to keep mem-
bers of the PLO from entering the U.S., while the State Department,
according to Secretary of State George Shultz, supports the President's
position that action against the PLO would pose unacceptable difficul-
ties in Middle East policy.

It is easy to say that because the PLO engages in hostile action on
a reasonably large scale against sovereign nations, they are a terrorist
organization. Of course, action such as funding insurrections and
training discontented factions to disrupt legal governments is not even
remotely terrorist, for it is often carried out by a legitimate state. Be-

* sides, the floor of the U.N. could get a little barren if that group were

to begin barring groups with ties to illegitimate violence, whatever
‘thatis. ‘ ' i

A belated tribute to
a fine human being

The death of Art Rooney, Sr. was a blow not only to the Pitts-
burgh sporting community but the city and nation as well.

Rooney was the heart and soul of the Pittsburgh Steelers or-
ganization since it was founded in 1933. Rooney bought the
club for a paltry $2,500 and eventually became one of the
founding fathers of the professional football league we know
today, along with the late George ”Papa Bear” Halas and Ed
McCaskey.

Rooney's presence will undoubtedly be missed in Pittsburgh.
He was never at a loss for a kind word or deed, and his hum-
ble demeanor may never be equaled by someone who had at-

P tained his position.

- Although Rooney probably would have balked at the entire
process, his funeral services proved to all that Rooney was one
of the most beloved men in Pittsburgh, as well as in the sport-
ing world.

Relatives, friends, acquaintances and former players, whose
lives he may have touched more than anyone else’s, joumeyed
from around the country to pay tribute to Rooney last weekend.

Rooney claimed to be nothing more than a common man.
Many club owners are nothing more than businessmen. Rooney
was a friend to everyone around him, whether they were play-
ers, staff or the people of Pittsburgh.

Rooney probably would not have wanted his team to remem-
ber him in the way that the Pirates have memorialized the late
Mayor, Richard Caliguri, but the team will wear patches in his
honor this year. Undoubtedly, the team cannot forget what their
owner meant to them. Neither can the people who knew
Rooney, or just knew of him.

Finding a

A few days ago, I went back to
Penn Valley,Pa. to see my fami-
Iy, friends and loyal St. Bernard,
Sophie. As my plane landed at
Philadelphia International Air-
port, I vowed not to look at a
book or pick up a pen for the en-
tire duration of my visit. My days-
would consist of sleeping past 2
p.m., drinking till 3 a.m. and
watching television in-between.
The weather was warm, the
refrigerator stocked and the bars
were packed. It was after the se-
cond day that I wanted to go back
to Pittsburgh.

I couldn't really sleep my first
night at home. When I arrived, I
found my bed made, my room
vacuumed and my desk clean.
Pictures and other pieces of my
adolescense were neatly ar-
ranged throughout the room. My
sheets were freshly ironed and
matched the new bedspread my
mother bought at Bloomingdales.
_ As I stood in the doorway with
Sophie at my side, I felt like I was
checking in to Mom Duchin’s
Motel. I

The temptation of the

It seems that often the impor-
tance of controversy is lost on the
leaders and members of religious
institutions. Wherever The Last
Temptation of Christ has played,
it has been accompanied by
waves of protesters and boycot-
ters who wish to suppress the film
and thus keep it from corrupting
the faith of ”good, decent peo-
ple.” When it opened at the
King's Court theater in Oakland,
it was reported that 3,000 people
walked past the theater with light-
ed candles in protest. In many
communities, theaters suc-
cumbed to pressures from various
sources and declined to play the
film at all.

What these people fail to real-
ize is that a film like this can be
as powerful a tool for confirming
and strengthening faith as it can
be for weakening and destroying
it. ‘

For a person's faith to be worth
anything at all, it must be strong
enough to withstand outside in-
fluences of all kinds, many of
them more compelling than a
simple movie.

If a person is not tested, then it
is impossible to judge the quali-

They both seemed happier.

On the second day of my visit,
I had dinner with my mom and
her boyfriend, Garry. He and I
talked about sports, politics and
exchanged bad jokes. My mom
seemed a little nervous seeing us
together and I felt like her father

her. As dinner progressed, I no-
ticed how different Garry was

in insuring that the strength of
that commitment will atrophy
and eventually decay altogether.
To remain strong, one must be

Furthermore, by attempting to
shut out all beliefs other than

for themselves an image of in-

potential converts from taking

this will deter a curious non-
believer from making any further
effort to learn about and become
involved in their religion.
Religions which truly want to
intensify the faith of their follow-
ers should welcome the opportu-
nity to publicly re-evaluate their
long-held beliefs and truisms.
They must accept the challenge,

' and actually listen to what the op-

position has to say if they wish to
refute their arguments.

The same goes for the artists who
make a film, any film, not just a
religiously related one. One has
to be prepared to have one’s art
questionedtif he expects it to be
taken seriously. The producers of
The Last Temptation of Christ
should welcome opposition and
controversy as much as religious,
leaders should. Only by facing
this can they meet the challenges
inherent in being challenged. It is
not possible to triumph over an
opponent by pretending that he
is not there, nor by keeping him
locked away from human sight.
If his issues are valid, they will
arise again and again. If they are
not, then the only way for the
world to know is for them to see
for themselves.

Two cents worth of Quayle  

All you hear lately at parties is
talk about Dan Quayle. Everyone
seems to have an opinion, and
I've taken note of some of them.

’’I don't care if you went to the
Mekong Delta, the Indiana Na-
tional Guard or Canada during
the Vietnam War — as long as
you went somewhere.”

’’I think Quayle is lucky to have
a Dad who would use his in-
fluence to get him into the serv-
ice of his choice. Most fathers
would let their sons do it on their
own.”

”The National Guard plays an

important role during wartime,

especially if you have an ugly
strike in Indiana..”

”The press is making a big deal
out of Quayle’s lousy record in
college. But everyone knows that
you don't need a Ph.D. to be vice
president of the United States.”

”If Clint Eastwood had spent
six years in the National Guard in
Indiana, he never would have to
look for movie material again.”

”Quayle may not have a great
senatorial record, but don't forget
that he's awfully young to vote.”

”Sure, Quayle had lousy
grades when he was admitted to
law school. But there's nothing
wrong with that. He's running for
vice president — not for county
judge/’

ART W
BUCHWALD

”Bush knew he had the right
running mate when he asked
Dan Quayle whether he had
burned an American flag, and
Quayle said he hadn’t.”

”Another plus of having Dan
Quayle a heartbeat away from
the presidency is that if he ever
has trouble with Iran, he can call
up his father and mother and ask
them to fix it.”

”Dan Quayle is getting a bad
rap on his military service. If he
knew someday that he was going

to be the vice-presidential Candi-V

date he would have paid ‘his own
way to Vietnam to participate in
the Tet Offensive.”

”Dan is strong on Star Wars
and weak on veterans’ benefits,
but that doesn't mean he fooled
around with Paula Parkinson.”

”The question of influence
should not be a political issue.
You don't put people down be-
cause they have a bigger Rolodex
thaniyou do.” _

”The trouble with George Bush
is thathe is taking all the atten-
tion away from Danny. It’s the
vice-presidential campaign that

deserves the people's attention.”

”They say we should drop this
stuff about Dan's background and
deal with important issues such
as the economy and the com-
munist threat in Central America.
But they always say that when the
campaign isn't going well.”

”I don't know what it takes to
qualify for vice president of the
United States, but I believe once
you nominate a person you have
no right to embarrass him with a
lot of personal questions.”

”Bush could have chosen any-
one he wanted as his running
mate. The fact he picked Quayle
without checking him out means
Bush is his own man.”

”Quay|e may not make the
greatest VP, but at least he'll look
great at a state funeral.”

”I’m glad the brouhaha on
Quayle broke because it brings
the entire presidential race down
to the bottom level where it
belongs.” I

”The reason I would trust Dan
Quayle to put his finger on the
button in the Oval Office is that
he is probably one of the best gol-
fers in Washington.”

syndicated columnist from the
Los Angeles Times.

Many served on the home front

Like Dan Quayle, I wanted to S

avoid getting caught up in the un-
certainty ’of the draft during the
Vietnam period. So I enlisted in
the Army. My motives were less
than pure. As Quayle wanted to
pursue his interests in law school,
I wanted to pursue my interests
and budding career in jour-
nalism.

Approaching the Army as an
employer, I decided that Armed
Forces Radio and Television Serv-
ice would best allow me to be all
that I could be. Officers in charge
of the New York office told me
that there was an opening. They
said they were unable to guaran-
tee me the assignment, but my
chances would improve ifl enlist-
ed rather than wait for my num-
ber to come up in the draft.

My career had already begun.
I had gone to college and was
married. Taking a chance with
the draft and winding up in Viet-
nam (probably as a broadcaster in
Saigon and not an infantryman;
they usually match civilian ex-
perience and aptitude with mili-
tary assignments) seemed to be a
foolish and unnecessary risk.

I did get the assignment in New
York which, as I recall, paid me
$99 a month in salary and a small
housing allowance. I had to work
another full-time job and part-
time job to make ends meet.

I I suspect that Dan Quayle in
1969 harbored the same doubts
about the war thatl had in 1965.
Those were morally confusing
times. U.S. Senators like George
McGovern, Mark Hatfield and
Birch Bayh said that the war and
our involvement in it were im-
moral. Clergymen like William

Sloane Coffin and Daniel and

Phillip Berrigan helped young
men dodge the draft by escaping
to Canada or other countries.
Editorial writers for influential
newspapers denounced the war
and spoke of young lives being
needlessly sacrificed. Many of

CAL
THOMAS I

our classmates were demonstrat-
ing against the war.

Quayle and I heard those
voices. Like the vice-presidential
nominee, I wanted to serve my
country. But I felt that given the
gifts I had, myjpen was mightier
than my sword ever could be.

Quayle and I were not alone.
At least a dozen current members
of Congress joined local reserve
or national guard units and
served their military obligations
at home. _

Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), who
was touted by some as being
presidential or vice presidential
material this year, enlisted in the
Air Force Reserve in 1967, served
a six—month tour of duty (like
Quayle) and returned to New
York to play professional basket-
ball. Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D—N.M.)
served six years in the Army
Reserve from 1968 to 1974, after
finishing law school.

Many other members of Con-
gress did not serve in the military
in any capacity. According to
Congressional Quarterly, of the
131 members of Congress born
between 1942 and 1950, only 41
served some time in military
service.

Perhaps the reason the
Democratic ticket has remained

silent on the Quayle matter is be-
cause of a proclamation issued by
Gov. Michael Dukakis declaring
Feb. 22-29 ”Amnesty Weekin
the Commonwealth.” In that
proclamation, Dukakis granted
amnesty to. Massachusetts resi-
dents who had dodged the draft.
He equated the moral stand taken
by those who chose to serve in
the military during the Vietnam
period with the ”morality” of
those who left the country to es-
cape their obligation.

Dukakis also compared the

pain felt by families who had lost
a son inlVietnam with the suffer-
ing of those who ”lost” a son to
Canada: ”Many Americans lost
loved ones, killed or missing in
action in" Vietnam. Yet, those
who would not serve  suffered
the effects of separation of social
stigma as a result of their deci-
sion,” he said.

That proclamation, coming just
three years after the last U.S.
troops were ordered out of Viet-
nam and coming at a time when
our national psyche was still
hemorrhaging over the conflict,
ought to generate. a far greater
controversy than Dan Quayle’s
morally understandable and
defensive decision to serve in the

National Guard. After all, Quayle L

was in good company.

A surprise visitor

can change minds

I'm sick and tired of hear-
ing about the ’’plight of the
homeless.” To put it quite
simply, street people have
put themselves in the posi-
tion they are in. By their
own free will, they have de-
termined that they will
never amount to anything
and so should do the best
they can on their own,
however they can manage
to do it.

Up until Sunday, I was
somewhat sympathetic to

MATT
this problem. If a bum ap— 
proached me onthe street

and nicely asked for a quarter, I would occasionally give it to
him. Not that I'm any better than these people, but someone
asking me for money that I worked for usually doesn't appeal
to me. ’ ‘

But Sunday entirely changed my outlook on these saps we
always see on the street. '

I woke up to the rustling of newspapers and the squeak of
the refrigerator door being opened. Seemed kind of strange to
me, considering I was (or was supposed to be) the only person
in my Forbes Avenue apartment.

I rolled over in my bed and looked out the door of my room.
I heard the popping sound of an aluminum can being opened.
This also made me wonder, since the only cans I had in the
apartment were.Coors Light 16- ouncer_s. ’

 

” Maybe my roommates have come back from their weekend .

at home a little early,” I thought. _ . ..
I was wrong. As I looked out of my room, a face suddenly
peeked around the corner. Not a familar face, mind you. No,

it was the unshaven, dirty face of a man I had never seen be-'

fore. He was drinking oneof my beers and smoking a Marl-
boro he must have found on the floor.

He saw me looking at him, pulled his head backaround the
corner and didn't so much as breathe. I, in turn, reached back
behind my bed and pulled out the George Brett Slugger that
I keep on hand for any such incidents. '

He showed his face again, and by this time I was as mad as _
I was scared. Mayberthis guy had a knife or a bat of his;om_yn,,,’

But he was in my apartment, an uninvited guest, and I didn't
take too kindly to that. ’ to  «  = 7 « =

I slowly rolled out of bed with the intention of breaking his
kneecaps. But he must have known what I had in mind, be-
cause he darted out of the kitchen, beer and cigarette in hand,
and just as quickly dashed out the front door, his red Nikes
glistening in the morning sunlight.

I recovered my composure, threw on a shirt andshoes and

did my best Buford Pusser imitation. But as I walked out of my

apartment, this street urchin was nowhere to be found. He had
just disappeared.

Now, Irealized that he could not have just walked into my ,

apartment, so I figured that the door must have been unlocked
all night. Stupid of me, but still not a written invitation into my
humble abode. How did he get into the building, up to my third-
floor apartment? 9

The back door had been jimmied open to allow tenants to
move in and out, since leases are just beginning and ending.

_ The entire episode took less than five minutes, and I was lucky
that he didn't rob me blind before I woke up. All that was miss-
ing was a beer and a cigarette. My wallet and apartment key
were lying on the coffee table next to where he had been drink-
ing his liquid protein breakfast.

Thinking about it gave me a.who|e new insight into Oakland
and the street beggars. This guy could have made off with any-
thing he wanted, and no one would have been any wiser.

And if he had stolen, say, the stereo, I'm sure he wouldn't
have put it in a shopping cart and walked around the street with
it.

No. He would have sold it for five bucks if the opportunity
arose. Maybe a lot of the crimes committed in Oakland are not
carried out by your typical burglar. And if some of these bums
do indeed feel the need to break and enter,_ how can they be
tracked down by the police? They can't. The city is their home,

.not a numbered apartment or house. Easy pickings for street
people.

I was lucky. No harm came to anyone, and the missing items
didn't mean much to me.

But take notice. These ”people” aren't as stupid as they may
try to seem. They have the ability to rob you blind, whether
it's in your home or their ”home.”

SHOWCASE  

Lo’rTmton‘ion  ofChrist

Getting to the bottom of all that fuss

By Matthew Myers
For the Pitt News

In 1980, there was a movie
about Jesus called Jesus. The
producers of this straightforward
film on the life of Christ knocked
themselves out for the sake of
authenticity. Director Peter Sykes
actually shot the movie in the
Holy Land, and the screenplay
was adapted almost verbatim
from the Gospel of Luke; yet
Hollywood J occasionally
managed to slither in. British ac-
tor Brian Deacon, who plays the
role of Christ, looks as if he just
emerged from a beauty shop,
while Alexander Scourby’s dry
narration lags. There is about as

much drama here as in a Sunday
school lesson.

In 1973 there was Jesus Christ,
Superstar, a rather uneven screen
version of the Broadway rock
opera, once again filmed on lo-
cation in the Holy Land. The sto-
ry of Christ is enacted to the beat
of rock music and with some con-
temporary trappings. It is certain-
ly an oddball way of presenting
a portion of the Scriptures, but the
cast does a good Job, and the
music is invigorating, especially
if you happen to like this style.
Ted Neeley was Jesus, Norman
Jewison (/\gnes of (lot/, Moon-
struck) directed, and the music
was a jammin’.

Now, in 1988, it seems Holly-

wood is ready for another
cinematic account of the life and
times of Jesus Christ, this time
with one minor catch: it’s not
based on the Bible.

”This film is not based upon
the Gospels but upon the spiritu-
al confrontation with the Holy
conflict...” So begins The Last
Temptation of Christ, Martin
Scorsese's (The Color of /\/Ioney,
After Hours) film adaptation of
the Nikos Kazantzakis novel of
the same name. It is a movie
about the human Christ, the
suffering Messiah who goes on a
spiritual quest in search of his
own identity and the true mean-
ing of God's unselfish blessing.
The entire outline of Christ's jour-

ney to the Resurrection is illustrat-
ed meticulously, examining his
initial confusion of purpose and
subsequent spiritual acceptance
to, finally, the allurements
presented to him throughout his
ministry.

Whether or not Scorsese in-
tended to be controversial is im-
material (has it ever stopped him
before?), but the script itself tends
to settle unevenly, pe.riodica|ly
tossing out manufactured lines
that are designed to turn au-
dience heads toward each other,
gaping in shock and amazement.

The screenplay, written by Paul
Schrader, (he wrote Scorsese's
Taxi Driver and co—scripted Rag-
ing Bull) is chock full of little

quotes that would automatically

Jesus like, ”Cod loves me. e al-
ways loves me. I want hi to
stop. I want him to crucify all his
messiahs,” would probably be a
main course on more than a few
debates. It really seems like a
pretentious piece of script-writing
when you think about it, but
then, not everyone may get the
point of the movie. Which is?~
The film begins in Nazareth as
Jesus (Willem Dafoe), the car-
penter's son, builds crosses for
the Romans to use in their numer-
ous crucifixions. Lately, however,
Jesus has been suffering from very

hope is the beginning of a life-
long adventure in learning. I

ideals, hopes, and purposes bonded together by deep friend-
ship and mutual" understanding. Such a bond furnishes the
indispensible incentive which turns the college youth into
the poised and self conﬁdent man —— equipped with a keener
mind, a greater appreciation, and broader sympathies, and
fortiﬁed by a group of true and understanding friends which
will abide through life.

WHY JOIN A FRATERNITY?

Pitt’s fraternities can offer more to the new student than
most other campus organization. Each of the 20 national
fraternities on campus has its own unique charateristics and
personalities which means that there is a fraternity for
everyone. These fraternities have many things to offer that
will not only enhance your college life, but be valuable
throughout your entire life.

ACADEMIC

The reasons one comes to school in the ﬁrst place is for
an education. Pitt Geeks have a higher overall grade poiiint
average than that of the campus average. In each frateni-
ty, you will ﬁnd students with many different majors, stu-
dents that can help you with your classes and problems.
Having people that can help you with your education will
take a lot of pressure off of adjusting to a completely new
environment.

Paid for by your Student Activities fees.

A college fraternity is a select group of men with similar ,

SOCIAL -

Pitt Greeks use their membership as a founda-
tion for participation. In a fraternity, you have
many chances to make new friends through par-
ties, mixers, and involvement in such things as
Greek Week and Homecoming. There are
Greeks involved in every aspect of the univer-
sity such as Student Government,Resident As-
sistants, and numerous honoraries. Knowing
these people as friends makes college live a lit-
tle easier.

 Trophy awarded at the end of the year to the

chapter most successful in all of these sports.
Sports p1ay_a big part in the Greek system, by
participating, win or lose, we always have fun.

BROTHERHOOD

A fraternity gives the new student a-»startigng-

point. By becoming a member of a_ fraternity,
you have a base from which to grow at Pitt. It
is often hard for a new student to establish
friendships at a large university. Being Greek

provides you with a special group of friends. A

It is from this group that one grows academi-
cally and socially. These men won’t be just your

friends, but your brothers for life. Pitt Greeks g .

don’t limit themselves to their fraternities, but
use them as foundations for participation in
many other facets of university life.

FRATERNITY RUSH REGISTRATION

Fraternity Rush takes place from August — Sep-
tember 15. During this period fraternities will
host a variety of rush functions so that they can
get to know you and so that you will have the
opportunity to learn about their fraternities.
University policy prohibits the use of alcohol

at any rush function so please keep this in mind

when attending any activities.

Fraternity rush registration is free of charge
and will be taken at all IFC events. You may
also register in the IFC Ofﬁce, 628 William Pitt
Union, or at various sites on campus.

strange and painful dreams in
which he is crucified for acts of
sedition and revolution against
the state of Rome. Subsequently,
he becomes obsessed with
crucifixion and envisions himself
being led to his own horrible ex-
ecution. Judas Iscariot (Harvey
Keitel) fiercely rebukes Jesus for
his preoccupation with death: JE-
SUS: I'm struggling. JUDAS: No!
I struggle! You collaborate!
Later, Jesus visits the harem of
Mary Magdalene (Barbara Her-
shey) to ask for her forgiveness
before he leaves for the desert to
pray. As he leaves, she bitterly
mentions a nostalgic moment

from their childhood together,
hoping she can coerce him to
stay.

Jesus heads for the desert to a
hovel where he is greeted by the
spirit of the master of the house-
hold, who, unbeknownst to Je-
sus, has just recently died. The
next day, one of the members of
the house converses with Jesus
and tells him what a wonderful
thing it must be to know God's
intentions. Jesus replies, ”You
think it’s a blessing to know what
God wants? It isn't. Fear prevents
me from doing evil. Do you want
to know who my God is? Fear.
Fear is my God.”

Meanwhile, Paul (Harry Dean
Stanton) hires Judas to murderJe-
sus. Once informed of his immi-
nent plight, Jesus shows no
resistance and ostensibly wel-
comes his fate. Judas, distraught
over one man's wish for self-
sacrifice, accompanies Jesus on
his journey to Galilee.

After Mary Magdalene is near-
ly stoned to death, Jesus preaches

of the almighty power of love and

its ability to overcome evil;
however, John the Baptist (Andre
Gregory) later tells him that mere
love is not enough to conquer
hatred in this world of sorrow.
”Be careful,” he says. ”God is
not alone up there.”

While Jesus resides in the
desert for 40 days and nights, he
is visited by a serpent, a lion and
a talking flame. An apparition of
John the Baptist appears and

. later, afterJesus has returned from

the desert, he finds thatJohn has
been murdered by King Herod.

a normal life with Mary Magda-
lene as his wife. At last, Christ
resists and becomes the resurrect-
ed Messiah.

It should be a point to note that
The Last Temptation of Christ is
a remarkable display of richly
crafted filmmaking. It is a pro-
foundly different and utterly con-
temporary motion picture that
reaches new levels in the
cinematic art form.

But the major problem with the
film isn't so much directing as it
is writing and acting. Paul
Schrader (director of the upcom-
ing Patty Hearst) has written a
screenplay that simply begs for at-
tention. Lines stick out in various
places, trying to be dramatic
when it's obviously an attempt to
overwhelm the audience: Are
you the Messiah? JESUS: I see
men and I feel sorry for them,

. that's all.

A lot of the scenes from the
movie are tremendously hyperin-
tense. For example, while Christ
is fasting in the desert, an apple

-tree materializes beside him.

Christ then proceeds to pluck a
fruit from the tree and takes a bite
as two pints of fake blood run
down his chin. Effective? Maybe.
Later on the lion appears, giving

C.S. Lewis fans something to be -

proud of.

cial effects achievement,
however, comes when'Jesus in-
serts his hand into his chest a la

beating. heart just as easy you
please. Spellbinding. '

Last Supper and the Crucifixion.
As the camera pans across the
faces of the disciples gathered at
the Passover meal, we see that
Mary Magdalene and the Virgin
Mary have joined them. it is quite
a passionate and triumphant
scene. But the Crucifixion is un-
doubtedly the most moving and
poignant moment of the entire
film. What makes the scene so
memorable is its enormously
graphic and bloody execution of
Jesus, enhanced admirably by
Dafoe’s brilliant and powerful
performance. ,You can practical-
ly feel his tremendous agony and
despair as he is lifted on the cross
above a throng of mocking
Romans.

As incredibly vivid as this
scene is, it doesn’t last very long.
The much-talked—about fantasy
sequence takes up the next 20
minutes, practically putting the
audience to sleep with its depic-
tion of Christ leading a normal
life married to Mary Magdalene.
The steamy sex scene between
the two is brief, but scorching
enough for a gasp or two.

in terms of acting ability,
Willem Dafoe’s Jesus is remark-
ably convincing, his performance
very heroic and certainly one of
the  roles he has had since
Platoon, although his other big
movie was Off Limits (pun in-
tended). Barbara Hershey (Hoos-
iers, A World Apart) also delivers
a very fine portrayal of Mary Mag-

Now that a new schoolyear is under
way, we have an idea that’ll make both
you and your parents feel a bit more

pointment, however, as Judas ls-
cariot. He's done much better
work in his other films and it is
an absolute shame to see,him
making the contemporary dia-
logue of this movie seem awk-
ward and flat. I much preferred
his role in The /\/Ien’s Cluband
thought Judas was one of his most
inferior performances. Also,
Andre Gregory, fresh from his
preacher role in The Mosquito
Coast, gives an enthusiastic but
poor approach to John the Bap-
tist. Harry Dean Stanton is also
bearable as Paul, but he’s done
better. Although Sting was origi-
nally supposed to play the role,
(can you believe it?), David
Bowie (Merry Christmas, Mr.
Lawrence, Labyrinth) does a com-
pletely mediocre job in his
cameo as Pontius Pilate. Why he
is given substantial billing is be-
yond my capacity. That's
Hollywood. <

One of the movie's most beau-
tiful accomplishments is its
cinematography. Michael Ball-
haus, who was nominated -for an

Oscar last year for Broadcasty J
News, does a magnificent ‘job i

Ever since Barbara Hershey

Bertha back in 1971, the New
York director has been trying to
get the story onto film. His per-

a new, modern, and low Christol-
ogy film of Jesus, showing the
confusion and humanity of one
man's inner struggle to fulfill
God's prophesy and the tempta-
tions he must face on the road to
Salvation. Besides, controversy
means box office returns in
Universal City.

bum. It is a remake of the song
that appeared on Secret Treaties.
The newer version is slower,
more modern, and it has more of
a beat.

”Magna of Illusion”: An inter-
lude of spoken parts steals some
of the thunder of this song.

Vocally, BOC has gone for
more backing harmonies than be-
fore. While Eric Bloom still lends
his distinctive voice to the songs,
he relinquishes control of the
backing vocals to the group as a
whole. This results in a more
gothic sound on many tracks, and
quite a different feel for the end-
ing‘ of ”Astronomy” than the
previous version.

Producer and co—manager San-
dy Pearlman took a strong hand
in this album, not only exercising
the considerable influence of his
hyphenate roles, but also co-
writing every track on the album.

Strangely, while the narrative
on the record sleeve indicates the
specific order of songs given
above, the tracks on the album
do not conform to it. The order
in the writing tells the tale in what
seems the proper order, so I as-
sume that the order of songs on
the album is a result of the desire
of CBS or producer Pearlman to
juggle the tracks by some other
metric. They move the best origi-
nal track on the album, ’’I Am
The One You Warned Me Of,”
to the lead track, so I assume they
mixed the tracks up in the order
they normally do to ensure that
the best tracks are on side one at
the beginning and end. In this
case, however, I think that the al-
bum loses some coherence in the
process. Still, with most CD play-
ers, you can reprogram the album
to play in the intended order.

Incidentally, the album runs
55:31 in nine tracks on compact
disc, which, if the same on the al-
bum (which I am not sure would
fit), is a hefty amount of music.

In conclusion, this album,
while not living up to the halcyon
days of BOC, or their best album,
Fire Of Unknown Origin, it is a
swing back from their last album,
Club Ninja, and an interesting
concept album to boot. BOC fans
will want to add this one to their
collection even if they were not
impressed with Club Ninja. Fans
of hard rock with some thought

behind it. would also do well to.

give this album a listen.

Cleveland shapes up as top ”dawg” in AFC

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer

We hold these truths to be self-
evident, that all teams in the Na-
tional Football League try really
hard but are anything but equal.

Some clubs, like the Washing-
ton Redskins and the San Francis-
co 49ers, are highly talented and
execute the objectives of the
game to near perfection. Win-
ners. Determined collectors of
Lombardi trophies.

Others, like the Miami Dol-
phins and the Cincinnati Bengals,
are much less successful but also
highly talented and fun teams to
watch, ifyou like flying footballs
and lots of points but don't par-
ticularly have any concern over
the outcome of the games; they
act as the rodeo clowns of the
league while waddling in medi-
ocrity.

And yet others, like the Green
Bay Packers and the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, are much simpler
teams that have interesting little
designs on their helmets and kind
of sit back, relax and do their own
little thing each Sunday — lose or
sometimes tie.

There is no parity here. A party,
sure, every Sunday atyour local
stadium. But no parity. The last
20 years have proven that.

How many of us were abso-
lutely sure that last season's
league championship confronta-
tion between the Redskins and
the Denver Broncos would be a
hard-fought classic battle, one
that would end the long string of
NFC-AFC blowouts known as Su-
per Bowls?

Lots of folks. And it looked as
if it was going to turn outthat
way, until the ’Skins went out and
rocked the scoreboard for 35
points in a little less than the se-

cond quarter alone.

The best way to achieve ulti-
mate league balance would be to
dress all the teams up in Penn
State uniforms, distribute the ta-
lent throughout the league as
evenly as possible, via one of
those Strat-O-Matic board games,
and proceed to toss a two-headed
coin before each kick—off- heads
you win, heads you lose.

Sounds like football in Russia.

Tonight, the Kiev Halupkis ver-
sus the Chernobyl Charbroilers in
a rematch of last week's 0-0 tie.

Nope, parity doesn’t sound all
that heart-stopping, does it?,So
blame Denver coach Dan Reeves
for leading his team to slaughter
in the last two Super Bowls, not
Pete Rozelle.

As for the upcoming season,
don’t expect something exactly
like the iconoclastic year of 1981,
when the upstart Bengals and up-
start 49ers, two teams not even
predicted to have winning
records, charged out of the
depths and into a Cinderella Su-
per Bowl.

Underdog versus underdog. It
hasn't happened since, and it
shouldn’t happen this year. Gi-
ants, Redskins, 49ers, Dolphins,
Broncos —— all look good. But
here is a fresh, new idea to chew
on:

Dr. D’s prediction? Look for the
Minnesota Vikings to meet the
Cleveland Browns in Super Bowl
XXl|l.

Welcome to NFL '88, and
now, on with the show.

0 THE AFC EAST  .1

The Buffalo Bills don't" fool
around anymore, people. The
team now moves in quantum
leaps, not hopscotch jumps. First,
they drafted aplayer who has be-
come the second-best defensive
end in the game today (behind

Philadelphia's Reggie White),
Bruce Smith. Next, the team
picked up certainly one of the
most talented quarterbacks of the
decade in Jim Kelly. And then last
year, the Bills secured two of the
three top college linebackers
available in Cornelius Bennett
and Shane Conlan.

Talk about a foundation.

The Bills, absolute abomina-
tions only three seasons ago,
have quickly become the most
talented team in the AFC East.
Although the running back posi-
tion and the wide receivers leave
something to be desired, Kelly is
still capable of putting points on
the board. Coach Marv Levy pos-
sesses the most powerful team
he's ever had. lt’s now up to him

to get Buffalo out of its deep-

freeze and put it all ‘together.
Prediction — 10-6.

The addition of running back
Eric Dickerson to the Indianapo-
lis Colts last season totally rear-
ranged the face of this division.
Dickerson, acquired in a trade
with the Los Angeles Rams, is the
division’s most dominating rush-
er since Miami's Larry Csonka.
And with the shortage of solid run
defenses within the division, the
Colts automatically become a
legitimate favorite. Now Colt

head coach Ron Meyer is better a

able to disguise his team's poor
passing attack, guided by quarter-
backs Jack Trudeau and that in-
firmary frequenter known as Gary
Hogeboom.

Watch the Colts come to rely
on Dickerson more andmore as

each week goes by.lWatch Dick-A

erson break his old single-season
rushing record. And watch the
Colts get stuffed by the first run-
stuffing team they meet in the
playoffs. Prediction — 9-7.
.He’s been doing it for years.

Don Shula, head coach of the Mi-
ami Dolphins, has been trying
since 1983 to field a respectable
defensive unit, one capable of
simply preventing other teams
from scoring points. No outra-
geous request being made here.

But Shula, considered one of the

greatest coaches in the history of
the game, hasn't been able to do
It.

Since the team lost defensive
coordinator Bill Arnsparger after
the 1982 season, Miami's
defense has been downright
lousy. Oh, quarterback Dan Mar-
ino has taken them to the
playoffs, even to the Super‘Bowl,

on occasions. But stop —‘Marino, .

even slow Marino down, and you
stop the Dolphins. Rookie Eric
Kumerow, out of Ohio State, was
taken in the first round of the draft
this year to help matters, but he
won't do much. Say, weren't
these guys the San Diego Charg-
ers in a previous life? Prediction
—- 8-8.

It has been three years since the
New England Patriots made it all
the way to the Super Bowl. You
remember 1985, don't you? All
those great Patriot-lvisnebaekersgi
that powerful New En'gl.and’ru.Sh-,
ing attack, the sharp young pass-
er behind center named Tony
Eason, the upset win in the AFC
Championship.

Well, the Chicago Bears
wrecked the Pats so terribly in
S.B. XX that they have yet to
recover. Since, they've self-
destructed emotionally, as well as

helped ‘tlie.'sit1:+ation -much. Easori
keeps getting himself banged up,
which has seriously slowed his
development. Linebackers Don
Blackmon and Steve Nelson re-
tired over the off-season. The
once—feared Patriot running backs

have lost their roar. Off-the-field
problems abound. And the
team's drafts have been atro-
cious. Head coach Raymond Ber-
ry and linebacker Andre Tippett
do their best to keep it all
together, but it's not enough.
Some new Patriotism needs to
flow through those red, white and
blue uniforms..Prediction - 7-9.

The New York Jets will crash-
land in 1988. And if they don’t,
Jets fans on the USS Vincennes
might consider blowing this
year’s team out of the sky. For the
lets have their problems, and
even though head coach Joe Wal-
ton is desperately trying to save
his job with a thorough house-
cleaning, New York won't have
enough new talent to keep out of
the division cellar.

The once-famous Sack Ex-

change has permanently closed. .

The linebacking crew has been
decimated as badly as New En-
gland’s. Once—effective QB Ken
O'Brien has been dumped on his
head 50 times too many and is
now rather timid in the pocket.
Running back Freeman McNeil is

in the_«_twilight of his injury-
A  career.

 J‘,etls_7§do-‘boast one of the
league's bestreceiving duos in
Wesley Walker and Al Toon. But
that’s comparable to Roger Cle-
mens finding himself pitching for
the Baltimore Orioles. Prediction
——— 5-1 1.

kick the door down.”

The door held up quite nicely,
as the Oilers lost. For the second
year in a row. The Cleveland
Browns can relate to that very
easily.

After losing a heartbreaker in
overtime to Denver two years
ago, a case of the last—minute bad
breaks once again struck the
Brownies in their now-annual
championship showdown with
the Broncos.

Had Earnest Byner not fumbled
on the Bronco 3—yard line late in
the game, Cleveland would have
likely advanced to play the Red-
skins in the Super Bowl. Instead,
the Broncos racked up 38 points
to the Browns’ 31.

Again this year, Cleveland is
the most solid team in the AFC;
they have a 22-9 regular season
record over the past two seasons.
What will keep the team out of
the Big One this time will be
what has done it in the last two
seasons — pass defense.

John Elway made the Browns’
secondary look like something
the USFL’s Washington Federals
might have offered. But instead of
looking for defensive backs in the
draft, Cleveland went the pass
rush route and picked up three
potential starters in linebackers
Clifford Charlton and Van Wait-

. ers and defensive tackle Michael

V i"llil‘I-ll'I‘ll VIHVI-Vr'lV\l[ vvullw

that, despite their talent, makes
them the second best football
team in this division. It's not
cockiness or brashness, which is
what one finds on the Oilers. It's
toughness. The Steelers are plain
tough, especially on defense,
where big play guys like Delton
Hall, Thomas Everett and Rod
Woodson lurk in the secondary.
Now that Pittsburgh has found
itself a solid quarterback prospect
in Bubby Brister, coach Chuck
Noll can temporarily stop worry-
ing about the negative media at-
tention which has been directed
at that position. With a potential
passing threat in the backfield,
opponents will have to divert
their attention away from the run-
ning backs. Watch rookie half-
back Warren Williams bloom
quickly. Prediction -— 9-7.
Seems that the Houston Oilers
lucked into a wildcard spot last
season. A 2-1 replacement team
record didn't hurt matters much
in contributing to the team's 10-7
overall record. During the regu-
lar season against 1987 playoffs
teams, Houston lost 27--20 to San
Francisco, 40-7 to Cleveland,
51-27 to Indianapolis and 24-10
to New Orleans. Pair that with
zero wins against playoff teams,
except for a win over default en-
try Seattle in the wildcard match,
and Houston did nothing impres-
sive. Denver put the exclamation

_ _ ,,,_

than impressive. Prediction —
8-8.

As long as Sam Wyche is the
head coach of the Cincinnati
Bengals, this, again using the

word, talented ball team won't

amount to squat.

Quarterback Boomer Esiason is
a true gunslinger, a cross between
Jim Zorn and Kenny Stabler. But
a add a poor rushing attack
paired with an enigmatic porous
defense — Cincy failed to sign its
first round draft pick, cornerback
Ricky Dixon — and Boomer pret-
ty much has his hands tied. Cin-
cinnati should have snapped up
Jim Mora as its head coach while
he was still available, and this
would be an annual playoff team.
Prediction — 5-11.

0 THE AFC WEST

What will the Denver Broncos
and John Elway have in store for
us this year? The last two seasons,
the Broncos have battled all the
way to the Super Bowl, only to

Washington, Heard go
in different directions

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

Yusef Washington, a sopho-
more quarterback—defensive back
from Duquesne has been named
the starting punter for the Pan-
thers, at least for the season
opener against Northern Iowa.

”l think he'll be a good pun-
ter,” said head coach Mike Gott-
fried. ’’I think he’ll average what
a good punter will average.”

The opening was created when
two—year starter John Rasp quit
the team during drills at John-
stown in mid—August. ‘
Gottfried also expects Washing-
ton to possibly add another
dimension to the Panther offense
somewhere down the line. With
Washington's background at
quarterback, Gottfried said,
”We’ll run him out of there,
throw out of there.”

James Findley, a Pitt shotputter
who walked on when the vacan-
cy appeared, is second—string at
this time, with Erik Matheison

backing him up.
I I I

The Panther receiving corps,
one of the deepest positions of
the team, lost a key member this
week.

Gottfried said that split end
Hosea Heard ”will probably be
suspended indefinitely for team
rules.”

Freshman Baron Jackson has
moved into the second-string slot
behind junior Henry Tuten, and
Darrin Gillaspie will also see
time.

I I I

World-class sprinter Lee
McRae seems to have found a
home on the Pitt squad. McRae
is the third—string flanker, behind
Billy Osborn and Reggie Wil-
liams, and will also return
kickoffs.

Although McRae’s speed could
become a great asset for the Pan-
thers,-Gottfried said that McRae
is having problems learning the
system. ”The terminology is still

Changing times force Steelers to
change personnel for 1 988 season

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

He is beginning his 20th sea-
son as the Pittsburgh Steelers’
coach, but Chuck Noll can't be
accused of being inflexible or too
resistant to change.

The times are changing, and so
are Noll and the Steelers. The
Steelers have replaced eight start-
ers and 11 veterans since 1987 in
perhaps the most sweeping off-
season transition of Noll’s two-
decade tenure. ‘

Gone are quarterback Mark
Malone and his bounce passes,

running back Walter Abercrom— -

bie and his quick dashes to the
sidelines.

Gone are three of the most de-
pendable players in Steelers’ his-
tory — John Stallworth, Donnie
Shell and Gary Dunn —— and one
of the most undependable, tack-
le Mark Behning, who spent most
of his three NFL seasons on the
injured list.

The Steelers not only cut sever-
al of their most easily recogniza-
ble names but some of their
biggest salaries. Stallworth and
Shell, who retired, both made
about $400,000 a year; Ray Pin-
Edmund Nelson, Robin
Cole, Dunn and Abercrombie
were paid at least $240,000 a

A year.

But the Steelers are changing
faces not just to save money, but
to save face. Noll is stockpiling
the Steelers with aggressive,
young players to remain competi-
tive in a league where the best
teams often are the most physical.

"That's what we're looking for
 to be hard-hitting, aggressive,”
Noll said. "The teams that have
been winning the Super Bowls
play that way  we're on that
track."

When the Steelers began their
youth movement, perhaps not
even Noll envisioned that his
1988 opening day roster would
be populated by so many new
players.

Fifteen Steelers weren't there a
year ago, including probable
starters Warren Williams, Ben
Thomas and Cornell Gowdy.
And there are new backfield start-
ers in quarterback Bubby Brister
and running back Warren
Williams.

"We're going to have a better

. football team and we're going to

play the season to find out how
this better football team, is going
to function and where it's going
to finish," Noll said Tuesday.
"That's one of the joys of coach-
ing  that you don't know how

it's going to come out.

"We're going to have a very,
very competitive football team,
and the key is we have to get bet-
ter as we go along. We've got the
potential, but we've got to real-
ize the potential. We've got some
young people who are potential-
ly excellent football players and
are in the process of learning their
profession, because it's much
different than college football.

"We're going to have a differ-
ent challenge every week, we've
got 16 challenges coming up
right now, and it's going to be
more than any of these kids have
ever experienced. They're going
to have a lot of things that will af-
fect them, affect their concentra-
tion. [The media] may say
something good about them and
they'll get out of hand, and they
may say something bad about
them and they may get down in
the dumps.

"We've got to weather all of
those storms/'1

Opposing defensive lines have
been storming Brister the last two
weeks, so Noll has switched vete-
ran guard Craig Wolfley to left
tackle.

The Wolfley move allows 1986
first-round draft pick John Rien-
stra to start at left guard. Rienstra
has been the Steelers’ most im-
pressive offensive lineman since
returning to training camp last
month following treatment for a
stress problem.

"His open field blocking and
his judgments have been very
good,” Noll said. "That's the best
part of his game. We want to be
able to get him in there and take
advantage of that  When you're
aggressive and go after people,
that happens."

The Steelers, coming off their
best preseason since 1984, are
3-point favorites for Sunday's sea-
son opener against Dallas. The
Cowboys were blown out by
Houston 54-10 in their final
preseason game. ‘

Steroid use on the
rise despite NCAA
rulings against drugs

KANSAS CITY, MO. (AP)

An off-season program be-
gun last spring by the Nation-
al Collegiate Athletic
Association at 25 schools
found nearly one-third of foot-
ball players at some colleges
tested positive for steroids.

"The range we saw was
from zero to up to 30 percent
positive at some schools,"
Frank Uryasz, director of
sports sciences for the NCAA,
toldThe Kansas City Star. He
told The Associated Press that

the overall average of players .

who tested positive was be-
tween 3 and 4 percent.

Steroids, synthetic versions
of the male sex hormone
testosterone, have been linked
to increased sports injuries and
serious health risks.

NCAA officials said the find-
ings, to be released in greater

detail this fall, suggest the cur-
rent policy of testing players
only prior to NCAA champi-
onship events and bowl games
may deter steroid abuse but
has not ended it.

Last fall, only 1.3 percent of
1,589 athletes tested positive
for drugs before NCAA cham-
pionships and bowl games.
Only seven athletes tested
positive for steroids.

Uryasz said the off-season
testing confirmed suspicions
that college athletes are
switching from oil- to water-
based steroids to avoid detec-
tion. Some experts say water-
based steroids‘ usually wash
out of most athletes within 14
days, so players preparing for
bowl games have time to
clean their systems of the
drugs.

spectacular. Prediction — 10-5-1.

The Seattle Seahawks have
their share of problems but have
just enough talent to keep their
heads above water in the deteri-
orating AFC West.

The Ioss of Kenny Easley in the
secondary will hurt extremely.
Pro Bowl linebacker Fredd
Young's holdout is tainting what
could be a fine Iinebacking unit,
with second-year pros Tony
Woods, Dave Wyman and Brian
Bosworth. '

Offensively, quarterback Dave
Krieg must stop performing bi-
weekly to fight off rookie Kelly
Stouffer, acquired fromthe Phoe-
nix Cardinals. The team waived
wide receivers Byron Franklin
and Daryl Turner, hoping new-
comers Tommy Kane and Brian
Blades can complement All-Pro
Steve Largent. Can running back
Curt Warner play all 16 games?
Prediction —— 9-7.

Tim Brown. James Lofton. Bo
Jackson. Marcus Allen. Willie
Gault. A Pro Bowl roster? No,
only the names of guys who play
offense for the Los Angeles Raid-
ers. Too bad there is still no quar-

. terback to distribute the ball to
these guys. The Raiders waived .2 I

last season's 1-2-3 combination
of Rusty Hilger, Marc Wilson and
Jim Plunkett, leaving them with
Steve Beuerlein and retread
Vince Evans. Watch for Al Davis
to deal for Washington reserve
Jay Schroeder, who's unhappy
with his role on the Redskins.
Defensively, Howie Long is the

second-best lineman in the ‘AFC,

playing on one of football's best.

. Yet, the linebackers are aging, as

is the secondary.

If L.A. gets a competent quar-
terback, it could easily unseat
Denver for the AFC West crown.
If not, another losing season.
Prediction — 8-8.

Any team that looks to Mark"
Malone for quarterback help
must be in a jam. And that's ex-
actly what the San Diego Charg-
ers did over the off-season, in an
effort to find a reasonable
replacement for one of the best
passers in NFL history, Dan
Fouts. Well, Malone couldn't win
the job, but journeyman Babe
Laufenberg did.

Defensively, defensive end Les-
lie O'Neil must recover from a
knee injury to keep the Chargers
respectable. The team's 8-1
record through the first half of last
season was a mirage; the team
lost its last six to finish 8-7.
Prediction — 4-12.

The Kansas City. Chiefs had
their best team of the decade in
1986, one that advanced to the
playoffs with a wildcard birth. So
the Chief's front office decided
the best move would, be to fire

iiithe .head coach, John»Ma‘c-kovic.

They did, and his replacement,
Frank Gansz Sr., guided K.C. to
a 4-11 record.

First-round pick Neil Smith of
Nebraska will find his way to the
quarterback on pure strength and
talent alone, but overall, this
team has once again lost its sense
of direction. Prediction — 4-12.

Next, the NFC.

New rule changes detract from
quality of college football game

Not many may realize this, but
a few rule changes have been in-
stituted into college football for
the coming season.

0 It is now mandatory that all
goal-post supports have padding.

It has been common practice
for stadiums to install the padding
to protect the players. Those few
stadiums that don't have the pad-
ding should have it anyway. So
this really doesn't matter.

0 The penalty for holding is
now 10 yards, up from the previ-
ous five. A

What we have here is another
way for the referees to take the
game out of the hands of the
players.

First of all, referees miss most
of the holding that goes on dur-
ing the game. It could easily turn
the game around and make a
good, hard contest into just
another boring game.

Holding is not a serious infrac-
tion and should not betreated
that way. I've never seen any-
body carted off the field after be-
ing held.

0 On a fumble on a point-after-
touchdown attempt, if any offen-
sive player other than the player
who fumbled recovers the ball,
the play is dead.

Let me ask: How does this help

- the game?

Not at all. It just opens every-
thing up for more controversy.

Here's a hypothetical situation.
Team A scores a touchdown.
They set up to kick the PAT.
There is a high snap and nobody
touches it.

Does it now mean that the
center is the only one who can
get the ball? Is it the holder who

     

VINCE I
CAREY

”fumbIed” the ball? Is the play
automatically called dead, since
nobody fumbled the ball and by
the rule, nobody can grab it?

So now team A is not given the
chance to score the extra point,
and it could mean the game.

0 Now the big one, the one
that really rides me:

On a PAT attempt, if the defen-
sive team returns either an inter-
ception or a blocked kick to the
other end zone, the defensive
team will be awarded two points.

Oh boy! What a wonderful ad-
dition to the game. Not only does
team B stop team A from scoring
the ever-important extra point,

I but they can be doubly reward-

ed by gaining some points of their
own.
Give me a break.I
‘The rules committee had to be
out of their minds to put some-
thing like this down on paper.
The job of the PAT defense is to
stop the score. Nothing more.
They don't deserve the chance to
score points.
Gee, why nottake it a little far-

ther and give them one point for
taking the ball half of the way
back? Or better yet, how about a
point just for stopping the try? Or
maybe half a point if the other
team misses on its own.

Tennessee coach Johnny
Majors summed this rule.up best
when he said, ”That rule was
written by somebody who had
too much time on their hands.”

I'm all for changes that make
the game of football better or
more enjoyable, but to make it
ridiculous just takes away from its
purpose.

Birth control pills may
spoil Myers’ hopes of
swimming in Olympics

AMERICUS, Ga. (AP) - With
time running out before Friday's
certification deadline for U.S.
Olympic athletes, swimming star
Angel Myers worked on at least
two fronts Tuesday in an attempt
to get back on the team.

The 21-year-old Myers, expect-
ed to be a strong contender in
five swimming events in Seoul
next month, was dropped from
the Olympic team Sunday after
failing two drug tests.

Supporters of the swimmer
from Americus said the test mis-
takenly read her birth-control
pills as prohibited steroids,.but
U.S. Olympic Committee officials
said they doubted that.

Myers’ coach and father, Kirt
Myers, said she would go to In-
diana University’s Indianapolis
campus for an independent drug
test.

People at the facility were
aware of the case "but said they
had been told to make no com-
ment about it.

Only four facilities in North

make cuts

burgh Steelers:

0 Walter Abercrombie, RB.
0 Robin Cole, LB.
0 Lyneal Alston, WR.
0 Marc Zeno, WR-
0 Jim Boyle, OL. _
0 Jeff L~ucas,.OL. I
0 Brian Blankenship, OL.

' 0 Jim Quick, ‘OL. '
0 John Dominic," D’Er.1_
- Al Williams, -L8-DE.

America are equipped to perform
the specific test involved. The
other three — UCLA, Vanderbilt
and a center in Quebec, Canada
— turned her down because of
contractual ties to the USOC, the
father said.

”The procedures are not abso-
lutely standard everywhere,” said
attorney Michael Fennessey,
chief of Myers’ legal team and a
professor at Georgia South-
western College. ”We felt it im-
portant to get a second opinion.
There is some subjectivity in-
volved.”

The family also was pursuing
appeals with U.S. Swimming
Inc., the swimmers’ sanctioning
organization. U.S. Swimming
could ask the USOC to entertain
another appeal, although Myers
already has been turned aside in
an appeal to the U.S. Swim
Team. .

U.S. athletes must be certified
by 11 a.m. EDT Friday with the
Seoul Olympic Organizing Com-
mittee. . I _
