For Policy of I
Deferred Rush

The Senate proposed that a de-
ferred rushing program for fra-
ternities be established as a uni-
versity policy.

Under this program, fraternities
will not be able -to rush "a fresh-
man until he has completed one
trimester at the university. This

program will ge into effect imme-

diately unless vetoed bypresident
Chuck Isler. ‘

A1 Garﬁnkle presented this mo-.
tion to the Senate. He_ said that

this policy is needed because with
the new trimester, “students. have

enough trouble getting use to this

stepped-up pace without being
snowed by fraternities”. -

IF Committee Set
To Study Drinking
For Frats -Only

Interfraternity Council is set-
ting up a committee to make a
thorough study of the use of al-
coholic beverages on campus.

The council, at its Monday
meeting, made it quite clear that
this investigation will pertain to

' fraternities only.

The council realizes that the

' present policy of the university

has a lot of pros and cons which
they feel this investigation will be
able to iron out. '

Jim Groninger, IFC president,
and other members of the coun-
cil feel that this method of ap-
proaching the matter of drink-
ing oncampus is the only pos-
sible one.

After careful study has been
made, their proposal will be pre-
sented to the Student Affairs Com-
mittee. Decision on -this matter
will be completely the responsi-
bility of the committee. The SA
committee consists of ﬁve students
and ﬁve members of the adminis-

Secretary of State Christian . 

Herter will deliver the com-
mencement address at cere-
monies on June 8.
_ Since the address will be
given a few days before he is
scheduled to leave with President
Eisenhower on a tour of the S0-
viet Uniorf and Japan, it is expect-I
ed that Herter will make amajor
policy statement in his address.
Before succeeding the "late
John Foster Dulles as secretary
of state last year, Herter had
been undersecretary of state
since 1937. He was governor of

Massachusetts from 1953 to
1957.
. Beginning his public service‘

career in 1916 as an attache in the;
American Embassy in Berlin, Her-..

ter subsequently served as a "spec-2
ial assistant in the State Depart-
ment, as secretary to the Ameri-
can Commission to Negotiate

’Peace and as assistant to Secre-

tary of Commerce Herbert Hoover‘
from 1919 to 1924.

He also was executive secre-

tary of the European Relie'f_"'_. '

Council in 1920 and 1921. In"
1929 and 1930 he lectured at
Harvard on ‘international rela-
tions. 6
Herter was a representative -in
the Massachusetts legislature from

 

 

1931 ‘to 1943, serving as speaker . 

from 1939 to 1943. He was a mem.-'

ber of , Congress from Massachu- -‘

Bowers to Leave
For V.P. Post At
School in Midwest ’

James "L. Bowers, director of '

 

development for seven profes-- ' "

sional schools, will soon become.
vice president of a midwestern
university. .

Bowers declined to name the
institution to which he is headed.
The school’s board was expected
to meet today, he said, and a
formal announcement would be
forthcoming from that end.

His resignati-on as the univer-
sity’s director of development-,

submitted in January, is effective. 

May 1.

The 31-year Bowers stated
that his leaving “has no bearing
on the events here of the last
two or three weeks.” He evi-
dently referred to the announce- \
ments that Dr. Jonas E. Salk, Dr.
Frank J. Dixon and six other
members of the pathology de-
partment were leaving the uni-
versity. ‘ .

“I am reluctant to leave Pitt
and Pittsburgh,” Bowers said. ”I
have spent a happy , two years.
here. The university and the city
have made great strides and the
future for both looks really bright.‘
I leave with no bad feeling what-
soever.”

stitute has just applied for a gov-
ernment loan, which is expected

-to be granted on the same basis

as aid given to research here at
the university.
One pathologist will be left in
the university academic depart-

_. mcnt in addition to all the hos-

pital pathologists.

Dr. E. R. McCluskey, vice-chan-
cellor in charge of the Health
Professions, commented on the
departure of the pathologists: “Dr.
Dixon’s move has been negotiated
for some time, and certainly

comes as no surprise to us.”

Fill Gap

Dr. McCluskcy answered a
question as to how hard it would
be to ﬁll the gap created by the
departing pathologists. “Dr. Dixon
came here ten years ago, and the
opportunities then weren’t any-
thing like they are now. We have
an excellent chance to fill_ these
positions with competent people.
We have to.”

Dr. Dixon came to the univer-
sity in 1951. In 1952, he was
named the outstanding young
medical researcher by the Amer-
ican Association for the Advance-
ment of Science. In 1957, he won
the annual award of the American
Society for Experimental Path-
ology.

* . , o
A T wa- way Beneﬁt
. _ With extremely few gxceptions, those who have view-
ed the new Book Center have spoken very highly of it. Un-
doubtedly one of the ﬁnest centers of its kind, the Fifth
_ Avenue store is unparalleled in this community. V
'0 T ‘ Very _little has been omitted. Consisting of nine sections,
'-the center offers more than 50,000 volumes of textbooks and
reference works, some 3,000 paperback titles, paintings,
.sculptures, ‘comfortable chairs which permit leisurely
browsing, and many other items. I .
In speaking of the Book Center, Chancellor Litchﬁeld
. has said:
, “The true character of the modern educational ..process
. is reﬂected in our new Book Center.” ,
This very center makes us wonder if securing as high
a "business proﬁt as possible is part of “the modern educa-
tional process.” . A
While primarily for the members of the university, the
center caters to the community as well. Any individual, no
matter who he is or where he is from, many‘ purchase any-
«thing the bookstore sells. And he may purchase these items
‘ at the same_ prices at which they are oifered to university
students. ' A‘ _
g It is commendable‘ that the university is inviting
'*members of the community to use the center’s facilities,

«criminated against by having to pay higher prices than
students do. ' ’ p '

It is not commendable, however, that the students can-
i not pay lower prices than non-university customers. This
complaint is not new to _administrative ears. Although they
have heard it for years, they have done nothing about it
. except to say discounts for students are impossible.

It would seem to make good business sense that a bus-
iness establishment should cater as best it could to its larg-
est consumer group. The university Book Center does not
follow this practice. 0 -

ﬂceptable. If the university would like to grant a higher dis-
_ count, the students would not complain.

A reporter for one of/Pittsbu_rgh’s daily newspapers has
mentioned the tax exempt status of the center may be in
jeopardy. He observed that a ten per cent discount might
strengthen the university’s position for tax exemption. '

The proﬁts which the university realizes from increased
sales to the-general public would permit students to buy
materials they need at lower prices, he wrote. .

If this threat of the center’s being placed on the tax
rolls is the only thing which would prompt the university
to grant a student discount, then we say let the threat be-

come more of a reality.

Just a-Little Trying . . .‘

The Individual Effort  

By Murray Chass .
(This is the last of two articles on the subject
of cheating)

Students plagiarize papers or have papers
written for them. They use the “tried and true”
system of cheat notes for exams. Some faculty

.members and departments offer the same tests

every year, thus enabling the
students to obtain copies of the
tests themselves or the answers
from previous years.

,Solutions to these problems
discussed on Monday must be
found. Obviously, discovering
such solutions is an extremely
difficult task.

A university is unable to halt
the reader service of an encyclo-
pedia company or a writers’ bur-
eau. A university even is unable
to prevent a fraternity from keeping a ﬁleor pre-
vent students from “inheriting’_’ papers.

One of the numerous faults we ﬁnd with‘ fra-
ternities — those supposedly high-level organiza-
tions which supposedly make the individual a
better person — is their lack of interest in achiev-
ing higher academic standards. ’

Several Attack Fronts

By destroying current ﬁles and never reactivat-

ing them, the fraternities can do their members,
both present and future, a great service.

This suggestion, however, is only a small part

of the overall problem-. No sweeping panacea exists
or even ‘can be formulated. No system or “police
force“ can do an effective job. Nor is an honor
code the answer. 0
If a student deperately needs a good gtade on
a paper or a test andfhas no qualms‘ about cheat-
ing, he will do it and at the same time sign a
statement saying he didn’t.> It is even too un-
realistic to'believe that a student who sees another
cheating will report that person. Society today

frowns upon that sortiof thing.
' If'we are to ﬁnd a way to begin the end of

 

cheating, we must go back to‘ the beginning.) We
must dig deeper than a code or a system. Indi-'
viduals must reappraise the distorted values they
have in desiring to copy term papers or to use
cheat notes on an‘ exam. Educational ethics, .in
general, must be, raised.

Perhaps this suggestion seems too idealistic.
But we believe there is no other place to begin.
If individuals are not capable of raising their edu-
cational ethics, cheating will continue to be as
much a part of academic life as ever.

The solution to the faculty problem is much
easier to place in practice. Although certain _ethics
also are involved here, the answer doesn’t require
a raising of any kind of standards. It requires only
that teachers and departments quit‘ being lazy.’
Someone Should Be‘Tired

~ Surely, the amount of material covered in a
trimesterprovides more‘than three essay or 100
multiple choice questions.

Some teachers actually exhaust themselves pre-
paring an examination. Others merely pull out an
old stencil and have the department secretary
mimeograph another 100 copies. .7

In preparing for and taking an exam given by‘,
the ﬁrst type of teacher, the students exhaust

themselves .For thesecond, they merely pull out .

a copy of the test produced by the same stencil a
few years previous. There’ is no exhaustion what-
soever. :

We don’t want to see everyone staggering
through the halls of the university at exam time,
but we do think the exhaustive test is much better.
for everyone"concerned. This situation can exist
only rwhen teachers and departments take it upon

themselves to provide different exams each yea_r. 

As was said before, these problems are not
Pitt’s alone. And they are not problems which.
have arisen along with the ghost-writing racket-
They undoubtedly have been in existence as .long
as formalized education itself. ' 4 I .

This-university, as well as every other, must do

something about cheating, all Lforms Agf it. They A

must do something until they can say not, “It can’t ,‘

I see where my fellow class-

the “Be sociable, ‘let’s go. party

anti-intellectualism In a y’,
have entered the University via

_ the Tuck Shop. and that the sign

had a hidden message.’ - _

Actually, the real culprit-lies
beyond the gothic walls of this

“tower of intelligence.” The term’ is

“be sociable” was originated in
a New York advertising oﬁice in
order to_ induce the American
publicoto drink more Pepsi-Cola
(You ‘know the beverage made
from denatured cocain; a”.sim-
ilar product whose name escapes
me at this moment is served in
the Tuck Shop).

For only ten cents, 12 cents (2
cents deposit), or five empty pop
bottles you can vicariously join
the “Sociables” at the West
Chester Country Club or on the
terrace of thier Arizona ranch
house. Look on the back cover
of your favorite magazine to see
where the“‘sociables” and the
room- full of Pepsis are spend-

ing their time this month. Does.

this current advertising cam-
paign seem to indicate that so-
cialability is an ultimate goal of
“The American Way of Life?”
Could be.

As for the ad taking a swing
at intellectualism, it may be do-
ing so, if its aimed at the Amer-
ican public. The phrase “Be
young and fair and debonair”
may cause aunt Susan to drop
her Revlon spring. potion and
switch to Pepsi instead.

The person who drew up the
poster can’t be blamed for using
a phrase that has proved suc-

Student‘Wishes to Be
Taught by Teachers

Editor, the Pitt Newszi

There has recently been a big
turmoil about the quality of the
University’s -teaching staff. After
the evaluation booklet is pre-
sentedto the student body next
September, the University’s pro-

fessors and instructors are sup-’

posed to be of a higher caliber
than" at present. I am in favor of
the tuition hike if, and only if,
the student receives suﬁicient
compensation pertaining to the
caliber of instructors, faculty,

and administration.

The University’s expansion
program is one of great import-
ance. By being able to enlarge
our university, we will be bet-
ter qualiﬁed to educate the
masses of new people entering
our school in the years to come.

I believe that the student as-
sistantships which are given to
gradaute students may be bene-
ﬁcial to them, but they are cer-
tainly not beneﬁcial to the stu-
dents. Too often these students
are working for their masters
degree, and have no interest in
going into the teaching ﬁeld.

This I have found to exist in
the math department. When a
physics major is teaching math,
he does not possess the devotion
which is necessary for teaching
math. HE IS INTERESTED IN
PHYSICS!‘ ‘Although he probably

    

math teacher, he is? not as pro-_
ﬁcient as the .\Tath teacher "or.

professor. ,
” Whereas the professor is dedi-

eating. his life to the teaching-.. »

cause, the instructor is only
using ‘his ‘math classes, '-as step-
ping stones. to his masters de-

gree _and employment with, bet- — J

ter pay. If he does.not‘want‘to-

be a math teacher,‘ I can’t hold

that against him. I don’t want I;

to .be‘a math teacher either. I 3-_{

just want to point outrthat if we

students.are going to pay more
money for our education, then
we.must demand
ards. ' "

There is also a problem in the-‘
chemistry department. Many of’

the lab instructors are unable to

5.‘

better stand-‘A  _ .’

understand the thinking and ‘the-’ A

actions of their students. This is
not because they do not know
their subject material; as a mat-
ter of fact,‘ they are quite ‘pro-
ﬁcient. ‘ '1

Thus, I am confronting the. *

student body with these situ-f‘ .

ations for their own good. I.only ',

know that I don’t want to pay, 
for a course when I am going to . '

get an instructor who is inferior
to another. »

Hoffman, LaBarre

By LOIS DIAMOND

The Midday Series will pre-
sent Paul G. Hoffman, ﬁrst
administrator of the Marshall
Plan, this Friday in the SU
ballroom. On Monday, Wes-
ton La Barre, author of “The
Human Animals” will address the
Midday audience. ~

Hoffman who will discuss
“United Nations International Ec-
onomic Development” presently
holds theposition of ﬁrst Manag-
ing Director of the United Nations
Special Fund. It is one of several
UN agencies concerned with the
progress of the less developed
countries.

“The crucial decade . . . is al-
ready upon us,” says Hoffman.-
“In that decade half the world’s
people must ﬁnd proof that under
free institutions they can achieve
not only a free but a fullerlife . . .

“I suggest that the kind and
scale of economic growth we
need and seek are at the fron-
tiers of world poverty . . . It
could produce victory in the war
most worth ﬁghting—the war to
eradicate ignorance and‘ poverty
from the earth.”

_ Author of “Seven Roads to
Safety” and “Peace Can Be Won,”
Hoffman served as the U.S. dele-
gate to the Economic and Finan-
cial Committee, during the Elev-

yenth Session of the UN Assembly.

La Barre, who discussed “Hu-
man Biology: The Nature of Hu-
man Nature,” is professor of an-
thropology‘ at Duke University. He
graduated summa cum laude in
1933 from Princeton, where he
was a member of Phi Beta Kappa.
He was also a recipient of the
Princeton Club of Pittsburgh
Prize.

La Barre proceeded to do
graduate work on the Garland
Fellowship at Yale, where he re-
ceived his Ph.D. in 1937. Since
that time he has been awarded
numerous grants and fellow-
ships to do research in Santa Fe,
Bolivia, Topeka, China; India,
Ceylon, and the VVest Indies.

Swim Meet

they were not in contention.
Howevcer, in the ﬁnals they ran
away with the race while set-
ting a new record.

The tourney featured four
double gold medal winners in
Stan Ashare of NYU, Dan Goldin
of CCNY, Nick West of CCN_Y.
and Drury Gallagher of Fordham.
West won his medals in diving.
and Ashare got his from the 200

I backstroke and individual medley.

Records Broken

Drury Gallagher was probably
the best swimmer there. Prior to
this year he held six gold medals,
but chose to enter only two
events. He easily won both, the
220 and 440 freestyle, pulling
away. He could have won three

-medals, which would have tied
Panther Ron Gainsford’s record of
nine gold medals.

Dan Goldin clipped one-tenth
of a second oﬂ’ the 100 breast-
stroke record, but really had to
ﬁght for ﬁrst in the 200 over

, his teammate Mike Bayuk. '

Depth meant a lot at the meet.
CCNY had two’ double winners,

with 49 points.

Next year Coach Grady expects
ﬁto bring the team trophy back to
the university. ‘With the added
depth of this year’s freshmen he
feels the squad should be sound
enough to win.

The 1960 season, dismal as it
was, concluded on a happy note
when Dr. and Mrs. Charles M.
Hughes, parents of freshman an-
chor man. Bob Hughes, met the
homeward bound train at Harris-
burg and supplied the team with.

Wagner’s was dated March 19,
1959. .

The following is an excerpt
from the letter: “The new book-

only with books and supplies but
with records, with art materials,
and many other things that have’
to do with the transmission of
knowledge and inspiration othe

. To Serve Tea

“This bookstore is going to have
listening rooms for people who
want,.to.hear plays on records.
It’s going to have a ﬁreplace and
serve tea in the afternoon so peo-
ple who are skilled in book re-
viewing can be heard. ‘ .

“From all of this you will
guess several things. In the ﬁrst
place, I’m not at all sure it’s go-
ing to make any money. In fact,
it may lose money and, if it does,
I don’t mind. for I want this to
be not‘just a utilitarian kind of
place, ‘but also a real cultural
addition to the campus.

“This bookstore will be a focal
point for the stimulation of peo-
ple’s interest in knowledge, in
values, and in ideas.”
