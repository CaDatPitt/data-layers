UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

DePasquale
resigns as
member of

-Alcosan

By Jonathan Berr
Staff Writer

Councilman Eugene
DePasquale announced yester-
day that he is resigning from the
board of Alcosan effective July 1.

In a statement released to the
press, Mayor Richard Caliguiri
said, "[DePasquale] is willing to
step aside so to allow the other
board members to focus on the
many important issues facing Al-
cosan in the upcoming years.”

DePasquale will remain on the
board until July 1, ”so that he can
be assured that the longstanding
Saw Mill Run sewerage problem
is responsibly addressed,” said
Caliguiri.

DePasquale, two other Alcosan
board members and an Alcosan
engineer recently returned from
the Association of Metropolitan
Sewerage Agencies convention
in San Diego, Calif., and was
criticized by the City Council for
spending too much money on
travel expenses.

In the past, DePasquale has at-
tended conferences for Alcosan
in Greece, Austria and Italy. Ac-
cording to an audit by county
controller Frank Luccino,
DePasquale incurred over
$32,000 in travel expenditures,

' more than double of any other

Alcosan board member.

"Since when is it illegal for
someone to take a duly autho-
rized trip?" asked DePasquale.

Alcosan has been under fire for
the past year and a half for al-
Ieged travel abuses, contract and
purchasing irregularities and
nepotism.

Yesterday, Councilwoman
Michelle Maddoff, a vocal critic
of Alcosan, sent a letter to
Caliguiri that called for the dis-
missal of DePasquale from Alco-
san but was unable to get the
council's support for her letter.

Councilman Jack Wagner said
that the council does not have the
power to appoint or dismiss any-
one from Alcosan.

After she lost the vote, Maddoff
said, ”You're all scared, and I
think it's a disgrace."

Maddoff has initiated a ratepay-
er’s lawsuit charging gross mis-
management in Alcosan. She is
presently seeking refunds for all
Alcosan customers.

DePasquale was first appoint-
ed to the board of Alcosan in
1975. He served as chairman of
the board until last January.

Police arrest woman after killing

By Tara Bradley-Steck
Associated Press Writer

PITTSBURGH —— A social wor-
ker was killed and three people
were taken hostage at a hospital
Tuesday night before the assailant
was arrested by police, authori-
ties said.

The assailant, a young woman
who was not identified immedi-
ately, was arrested at St. Francis
Medical Center in the city's
Bloomfield neighborhood at
about 10:15 p.m., police said.

The assailant apparently was
sitting with an unidentified social
worker in the psychiatric waiting
area of the hospital's emergency
room at about 9:15 p.m. when

Transplant

(AP) — A 3-week-old boy who
underwent a heart transplant this
week has developed lung and
kidney complications and re-
mained in ”very" critical condi-
tion Tuesday, hospital officials
said.

Jonathan Stowe of Beaver Falls
remained in the intensive care
unit of Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh, where he underwent
10 hours of surgery to receive a
new heart Monday. _

Dr. William F. Donaldson, the
hospital's medical director, said
the infant's new heart ”is not
functioning well on its own,” and

she suddenly shot the social wor-
ker as they sat side-by-side, ac-
cording to hospital spokeswoman
Shirley Freyer.

”The social worker was talking
to this woman and  there didn't
seem to be any conflict and a
security guard turned around and
heard four gunshots. They were
sitting, I assume, side by side,”
Mrs. Fryer said.

The assailant then took three
people hostage, apparently other
outpatients, and held them in the
emergency room for more than
an hour before they were
released unharmed, police said.

”Everyone else in the emergen-
cy room was evacuated. The peo-

the 24 hours ending Wednesday
afternoon were important to his
recovery.

The boy is receiving extra cor-
poreal membrane oxygenation to
perform the major function of his
heart and lungs ”in the hope that
his newlheart will recover and
become strong_er," Donaldson
said.

Hospital spokeswoman Lynn
McMahon said doctors have
ruled out a second heart trans-
plant for the boy in his present
condition.

The hospital said the boy's par-
ents, Tabitha and David Stowe,

ple who were being seen in
treatment rooms were taken out,"
Mrs. Freyer said.

Margaret Rizza, spokeswoman
for the city Public Safety Depart-
ment, said the woman was about
30 years old. She said city para-
medics, apparently on a routine
call at the hospital, heard the
shots and radioed for police help.

Police Chief Ralph Pampena
said four to six shots were fired
in the hospital.

He said it ”appeared as though
she (the assailant) had a mental
history.”

Police said the woman was
taken to the Public Safety Build-
ing in downtown Pittsburgh

patient in critical state

remained at his bedside. They
have another other son, Chad,
who is 3.

Jonathan was born Jan. 25 at
the Medical Center of Beaver
County, weighing 7.9 pounds.
Doctors soon became worried
over the failure of his tissues to
receive enough oxygen.

He was transferred to Chil-
dren's Hospital of Pittsburgh two
days later, where doctors found
he had been born with a severe-
Iy underdeveloped left heart ven-
tricle that dangerously restricted
the heart's ability to pump blood.

Sorority
sponsors
eating
contest

By Rich Cholodofsky

Staff Writer

Sigma Delta Tau sorority held
their second annual M&M-athon
for the prevention of child abuse
last night in the William Pitt Un-
ion Ballroom.

Pitt fraternities and sororities
paid a $10 registration fee each
to have an ”eater" and a ”cheer-
er" represent their chapter in the
quest to eat more M&Ms in three
minutes than anyone else.

The money, raised through the
entry fee and a raffle to guess the
number of M&Ms in a jar, will be
sent to Sigma Delta Tau’s nation-
al organization to be distributed
to the Prevention of Child Abuse
charity.

Mindy Aaronson, SDT philan-
thropy chairperson, said, ”I am
really glad we have something
we can do yearly. Nationals have
been doing it for the last six
years."

Deirdre Sullivan, SDT vice
president, said, "Hopefully, in
years to come the M&M-athon
will be more familiar to people,
and the participants will be able
to get sponsors for each M&M
they eat. This will make more
money for the charity.

"Most importantly, we need to
have it every year so people
know about it," Sullivan added.

Randy Black, representing
Lamda Chi Alpha, said he partic-
ipated because "our fraternity
wanted to support a good cause."

"I entered because we try to do
anything to help another Greek
for a good cause," said Pat Harty,
a Sigma Alpha Mu brother.

When it was all over, Harty
was declared the winner by eat-
ing 494 M&Ms in three minutes,
surpassing last year's record of
270.

Upon learning of his victory,
Harty said, "It is a proud day."

He described his winning form
as swallowing them whole. "I
stuck them whole down my
throat," he said. ’’I found the red
ones the toughest to eat."

Aaronson said she was pleased
with the event. ”I was really hap-
py. It went better than last year.
We will be looking for more par-
ticipation in the future.”

Last year, the M&M—athon
raised close to $100 for charity.

”We raised more money than
we thought we would [this
year]," Aaronson said.

Q: How do you tactfully ask a
boyfriend how many women he
has had sex with ~— and get a
truthful answer?

A: There is no tactful way t() pry
this information out —— and if you
mean, how can you get a num-
ber and a list of names and some
confidences about intimacies
with women before you, I suggest
that you don't do it. This can
come between a couple and spoil
a time that should have been lov-
ing and joyful. There is no rule
about whether this will destroy a
relationship or not, but for most
couples, it is best avoided. Ifyou
want him, accept the fact that he
has had a past and let that past
bury itself.

if what you mean is not specif-
ics of his past sex life but impor-
tant information about whether
he has been exposed to a sexual-
ly transmitted disease, you are

definitely entitled to reassurance
on this point. It is common now
for partners to give each other
reassuring clinical clearances.
The couple can visit a doctor
together to take tests and receive
counseling about avoiding in-
fection.

There is something else you
may have in mind —- you may
feel very strongly that you want
a bridegroom who has never
shared sex with another woman.
This could be a religious con-
sideration. In that case, you have
to tell him that this is a serious
consideration with you, and you
want the truth from him. Not a list
of names, but simply a yes or no.
There is no ”tactful" way to ask.
You just have to ask -— seriously
and respectfully. '

Between people making a
commitment, there should be
enough frankness and under-

why trust someone who will not

Woman has trouble asking boyfriend about his past

A: Take a long bubble bath or
a shower with fancy soap. After-
ward, stand in front of a mirror,
and smooth oil or body lotion
over your entire body in the most
leisurely and enjoyable way you
can. This is a lovely-feeling thing
to do, so don't rush it. Feel your
skin and concentrate on those
parts you like the most. But don't
stay with them all the time —
smooth that oil or lotion every-
where, thoroughly.

The places that usually feel
nicest to touch are even nicer
with that softening and smooth-
ing liquid. Think how nice your
body is, and ignore the bad mes-
sages you get about how you
don't like your thighs or your
nose. Never mind that —— just en-
joy giving yourself this luxurious
treatment. Give yourself good
feelings, and send a message to
your brain about how nice you

A: It bothers me that you have
had this fantasy so long and that
it persists. Also, that you want to
reduce him to a condition that is

zachechi, an Italian major.

According to Pitt junior inclus-
trial engineering major Mary Tay-
lor, ”There will be [fewer]
blue-collar workers for efficien-
cy’s sake. Computers and robots
are on the rise.”

According to Dr. Jerome
Shultz, director of Pitt's new
Center for Biotechnology and

‘Bioengineering, new non-

invasive forms of looking inside
the body without having to put
the patient through the trauma of
surgery are fast becoming a real-
ity in hospitals around the world,
due in large part to research done
here in Oakland, such as ultra-
sonics and magnetic resonance
imaging.

Dr. Shultz feels that Pittsburgh
and Pitt in particular will con-
tinue to play an important role in
developing new biomedical tech-
nologies.

”Two universities [Pitt and
CMU] with a high profile locat-
ed close together along with the
close proximity of several quali-
ty hospitals_makes Pittsburgh raw
material for major development,"
said Shultz.

In the area of cancer research,
Shultz described a potential
cancer treatment being devel-
oped locally that would utilize
"activated cells” instead of drugs
in destroying tumors. ”Through
genetic engineering, these cells
can be manipulated into smart
cells that seek out diseased
regionsof the body,” said Shultz.

Approximately 20 to 25 per-
cent of the female population on
college campuses nationwide
have an eating disorder. That
means one out of every four or
five women that we see every
day is not receiving the correct
amount of nutrition and exercise
to remain healthy.

Most of these women find their
condition very hard to talk about,
for they see their illness as a ”very

”The primary problem [of these
disorders] lies in [a lack of] com-
munication,” said Bauer.

One victim of an eating disord-
er did come forward, though, to
talk of her struggle with anorexia
nervosa and how she overcame
that problem. Anorexia nervosa is
an intense fear of becoming fat
which does not diminish as
weight loss progresses.

’’I was sick of being sick,” said
Judy, a Pitt junior. ’’I started not
eating at 14 to gain control of my
life. it's an easy way to control
what's around you."

At 16, however, she chose to
be hospitalized. ’’l was so
depressed and knew I had a
problem,” she said. ’’I wanted to
get over those feelings but didn’t

wanted someone to help me.”

Judy said that her parents were
”mad when it [her hospitaliza-
tion] happened and denied that
I had a problem. They don't say
anything anymore. I get along
with them now.”

Judy is close to complete recov-
ery now, but she still sees a doc-
tor once every eight weeks.

”When I came to Pitt, i want-
ed a new image,” said Judy. ’’I

S Jﬂgf/77 shooting
 spree

By Jim Clifford
Associated Press Writer

SUNNYVALE, Calif. — A form?
er employee shot at least eight
people at a Silicon Valley com—
pany’s offices Tuesday, and two
were believed to be dead,
authorities said.

The man, who reportedly was
upset over a relationship with a
female employee he had been
dating, barricaded himself inside
the two—story ESL Corp. building.
Witnesses said employees hid
under desks and inside closets.

At least three employees were
reported holed up a computer’
room and making telephone calls
to police.

The gunman, who called
police from a telephone inside
the building, said he shot three

people on the first floor "and as
many on the se('()n(l floor," Capt.
llal Scott of the Sunnyvale Pub-
li( Safety Department said.

The man "shows a little bit of
remorse," said lt. Tom Moore of
the safety department.

The man, identified by police
as Richard Farley, 40, was armed
with at least two high-powered
weapons and might have an in-
cendiary device, Scott said. Some

incendiary devices were found

TH E PITT NEWS

As Americans everywhere turn
their eyes toward Calgary, All)er-
ta, Canada, North America, they
find so far, sadly, an almost em-
barrassing Olympiad showing by
the US. amateurs - except for,
of course, that heart-stopping
12th place cruise-on-the—luge fin-
ish two days back.

There are plenty of plausible
reasons and plausible excuses
why the American excavation for
silver, gold and bronze has so far

pyrite — the pull of professional
leagues, lack of funding, que
sera, etc.

So, to get your minds off all
that, let's tune in to the Pittsburgh

Pitt survives Civic
Center scare, shoot
down Friars, 87-86

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

PR()\/IDENCE, Rl —- The Provi-
dence Friars three-point shooting
went cold, and Pitt's Jason Mat-
thews got h()t. And that was the
deciding factor in the Panthers
87-86 win last night at the Provi-
dence Civic Center.

Matthews hit two 3—pointers in
the last 1:16, erasing two-point
Friar leads both times. ”For a
freshman, that's big, very big.
You got to give Jason credit. He
was our MVP,” said forward Jer-
ome Lane.

Pitt, the first place team in the
Big East conference, led 79-75
with 5:44 remaining when Del-
ray Brooks started the long range
bombing. He hit two 3—pointers,
giving the Friars an 81-79 ad-
vantage.

Charles Smith, who led Pitt
with 33 points‘, scored inside to
tie the game at 81. Providence
center Steve Wright answered,
putting the Friars back up by two.

That's when Matthews, who
was shooting two for 11 at the
time, started hitting. His first trey
put Pitt up by one, 84-83. Brooks
followed with a three. But Mat-
thews hit another trey, giving Pitt
an 87-86 lead with :36 left.

”Jason won it in there at the
end of the game. You knew he
was going to hit them,” Pitt assis-
tant coach John Calipari said.

’’I had to hit them," said Mat-
thews, who scored 12 points.
”Towards the end, Providence
looked tired and they vveren’t
coming out on me. I knew we

needed more points. They had to
be threes.”

Providence still had one final
chance. The Friars got off two
3-pointers, but missed them both
in the final :17 seconds. Eric Mur-
dock missed from the corner, but
the ball went out of bounds off
Lane. Quinton Burton’s trey with
three ticks left rolled around the
basket and fell out.

Relief for Pitt. Disappointment
for the Friars.

”When it rains, it pours. It's
Murphy's law. But we're deter-
nined to keep working hard,”
Providence coach Gordie Chiesa
said.

”[Burton'.s shot] looked awful-
ly close. 1 was down on my
knees,” Matthews said.

Pitt [ranked 8th by Associated
Press] is 8-2 in Big East and 18-3
overall. Pitt has a two-game lead
in the loss column over Syracuse
(7-4) and at least a three-game
lead over the rest of the league.

Providence is 4-8 and 10-13.

”Every win is a big win in the
Big East. If we win at least five of
our last six league games, we can
win the league title,” said Lane.

Actually, if Pitt wins five of its
last six league games they will
win the regular season title.

Lane dominated the back-
boards, but didn't break one this
time. He finished with 16 points
and 18 rebounds.

The game was entirely different
from the Panthers’ 90-56 win
over Providence Jan. 25 in Pitts-
burgh. However, the Pitt players
insisted they didn't take the Fri-

Drugs prove to

FORESTVILLE, Md. (AP) ~— A
suburban Washington, D.C. high
school on Tuesday mourned the
death of football star Rico Leroy
Marshall - a senior who idolized
Len Bias and faced an athletic
career just as promising until ap-
parent involvement with drugs
took him to the same end as his
hero.

Many students at Forestville
High School were in tears on
their first day of school since Mar-

shall’s death Saturday.

Marshall's family continued to
deny their son was involved in
drugs, despite the story of a girl-
friend who said that hours before
he died, he told her he had swal-
lowed six chunks of crack to hide
them from police —- and despite
his arrest in December for posses-
sion with intent to distribute
cocaine.

Marshall, 18, appeared to have
everything going for him.

Toxicology tests to determine

the cause of death were expect-

Death

Continued from page 7
when [Bias] died it tested him so
bad,” a friend, Rodney Simms,
19, said of Marshall. ”He just
couldn't understand how it could
happen/’

Bias, a basketball star from the
University of Maryland, died June
19, 1986, from cocaine intoxica-
tion two days after signing to play
with the Boston Celtics.

Simms said if Marshall did have
drugs and saw police coming he
might have panicked.

’’If he had something like that,
he knew he couldn't get caught
with it," said Simms.

According to police reports,
Marshall's girlfriend, Belinda Hill,
said Marshall picked her up at
2:15 a.m. Saturday and told her
he had swallowed the drugs
when he saw two uniformed
police officers approaching him
about an hour earlier on a street
known for drug transactions.

Although the police stopped
Marshall, they did not arrest him.

On Dec. 22, at the same loca-
tion, police said they arrested
Marshall. A minor at the time, he
was charged with possession
with intent to distribute cocaine
after police found 29 grams of the
cocaine derivative, crack, on him
in 66 plastic bags.

Police sources, quoted by the
journal, said he was released to
the custody of his parents after
receiving a reprimand and proba-
tion from a community arbitrator
in the Juvenile Services Unit.

His father, Leroy Marshall, de-
nies knowing about the arrest.

Forestville High School prin-
cipal Paul Lewis said Tuesday he
wished he had known.

He said Marshall was one of his
favorite students, one of the most
mature.

Would Lewis’ knowing about
the arrest have made a
difference?

’’I’d like to think yes,” he said.
’’I’d like to think ifwe’d received
the information, we could have
done something that would have
prevented his death.”

Smiley may be starting left-hander for Bucs

BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -
John Smiley, expected to be the
top left—hander in the Pittsburgh
Pirates’ bullpen this season, may
be tried as a starter during spring
training.

"It's an option that could hap-
pen,” said pitching coach Ray
Miller.

Smiley, 22, was a starter for his
first three professional seasons
but pitched only in relief for the
Pirates last year, when he was 5-5
with a 5.76 earned run average
and four saves in 63 games.

With spring training beginning
later this week, Pirates manager
Jim Leyland said his tentative ro-
tation is all right-handed: Mike
Dunne, Doug Drabek, Brian Fish-
er and Bob Walk. Fisher made

the transition from reliever to
starter last season.

”We know John can relieve,
but because of the quick way he
picked up the curveball and the
progress of his straight changeup
- plus the fact he’s throwing very
hard left—handed —— it's not out of
the question to suggest it [start-
ing],” Miller said.

Leyland and Miller will also
take long looks at three other pos-
sible left-handed starters, Bob Pat-
terson, Bob Kipper and Hipolito
Pena.

Patterson and Kipper began the
1987 season as starters - Patter-
son was the Pirates’ opening—day
pitcher —- but wound up spend-
ing most of the season at Class
AAA Vancouver.

Patterson, 28, was 1-4 with a
6.70 ERA with the Pirates. Kipper,
23, was 5-9 with a 5.94 ERA.

”The potential’s still there with
them,” Leyland said.

Leyland said right—handers
Mike Bielecki and Vicente Pala-
cios also will challenge for a spot
in the rotation. Bielecki has shut-
tled between the Pirates and the
minor leagues the last two sea-
sons, while Palacios was one of
the Pacific Coast League's top
starters at Vancouver in 1987.

"ideally, you'd like to change
the scenario in a series, so the
other team isn't facing a right-
hander all the time," Leyland
said. ”But there's no senseput—
ting a [left—handed] guy out there

sure we have a left—hander who
can be better than Palacios or
Bielecki.”

”We’re going into spring train-
ing with our feet much more
solidly on the ground in terms of
knowing what we can do,” Miller
said. ’’I think this is the best pitch-
ing I've had at this age —— the
youngest and the most talented.
l think it’s outstanding."

Through July 1 last season, the
Pirates were 34-43 with a 4.78
staff ERA. After that, the Pirates
were 46-39 with a 3.69 ERA.
Miller thinks the difference was
the maturing of a young staff and
a more solid defense after short-

stop Al Pedrique, second base-
man Jose Lind and third baseman
Bobby Bonilla won starting jobs.

Miller, the former Baltimore
Orioles’ pitching coach and Min-
nesota Twins’ manager, said,
"I'm excited about our defense.
The first half [of the I987 season],
we didn't have that. That was
very, very traumatic for a young
pitching staff.”

The Pirates tried unsuccessful-
ly during the winter to trade for
a left—handed starter, but Miller
said it may not make any
difference.

”l’ve seen less [pitching] talent
win,” he said.

guarantee jobs after graduation

Getting the job you want isn't easy. Especially for recent college grads.
Very few majors will prepare you for a specific career, and guarantee
you get hired right out of college. For the rest of you, finding some-
thing you like won’t be simple. You could contemplate grad school.
Or law school. Two or three more years of school, and student loans
comparable to the national debt. There are very few jobs out there
that require little or no experience. Jobs that you would enjoy, where
the only requirement is a college degree.

The Federal Aviation Administration is now hiring Air Traffic Control
Specialists. Over 3,000 of them. All you need to qualify for testing is a
college degree. Any major is welcome. You don’t even need any avia-
tion experience. Consider the benefits: 0Salaries to $50,000 plus OUp
to 26 days vacation :1 year 0Special retirement plan 0Locations na-
tionwide 0Equal Opportunity Employer.

Graduation will be here soon enough. Consider a civil service career
with the Federal Aviation Administration. For more information
about a career as an Air Traffic Control Specialist, including an appli-
cation, send your name and address on a postcard to:

’’It was a running and gunning
game in the first half and I liked
that. We just made too many mis-
takes. People can’t beat us, we
beat ourselves,” Lane said.

Pitt led 46--38 with 2:20 left in
the half. But Providence scored
the last nine points. A Steve
Wright tip in with :20 left gave
Providence a 47-46 halftime lead.

”l didn't think our defense was
good at all,” Pitt coach Paul
Evans said.

Wright scored 18 first-half
points and finished with 25. But
he wasn't the only dominating
big man in this game.

Smith scored 21 first—half
points, including 18 of Pitt's first
26.

Said Smith: ”What hurt Provi-
dence was they didn’t have weak
side help because they were so

lworried about Jerome on the

boards.”
Pitt led early in the game, but

_ Providence tied the score 20-20

on a jumper by Abdul
Shamsid—Deem.

The Panthers then ran off eight
straight points, four each from
Smith and Lane. Providence
called timeout at the 9:40 mark
with Pitt leading, 28-20.

The Friars were able to climb
back in the game. Brooks scored
seven straight points, pulling
Providence to within one, 31-30.

Brooks picked up his third per-
sonal foul at 6:38 and sat out the

rest of the half.

Smith also picked up his third
foul at 5:23. He went to the
bench with Pitt leading, 36-34.

Demetreus Gore scored on an
inbounds play and Sean Miller hit
two foul shots on a bench tech-
nical against Providence. Pitt led
40-38.

In Smith's absence, Lane took
over Pitt's scoring load. He
scored six straight points to give
Pitt a 46-38 lead.

Brooks added 22 points and
Darryl Wright had ten for
Providence.

Pitt was outscored 76-60 from
the field. But the Panthers made
27 foul shots to Providence’s 10.

PANTHER NOTES: Miller was
4-4 from the foul line. His 29
consecutive foul shots ties the Pitt
record set by Terry Knight in the
1977-78 season  Smith’s 33
points were a personal best in the
Big East Smith's 12-13 (.923)
shooting is a new Pitt single-game
fieldgoal percentage record. Lane
held the previous mark. He was
11-12 (.917) against Syracuse last
year Pitt is 10-3 in Big East road

nailed a great bar routine, win-
ning the event with a 9.25.

Another freshman, Kathy Wal-
lish, won the floor exercise with
a season high of 9.15.

Junior Trish Aser had a good
meet, placing second on two out
of three events. Aser scored a 9.2
on balance beam and a 9.15 on
vault (tying with Temple's Kris
Hollenbach).

Coach Debbie Yohman had
”real mixed feelings” about the
meet. ’’I was disapointed in some
performances, but others were
really good. We're still getting
better in some areas but we're not
maintaining in other places,” said
Yohman.

Even though injuries are still
hurting the team, three gymnasts
made it back into the line-up to
contribute to the win. Senior
co-captain Leann Vaughn, junior
Stephanie Megill and freshman
Robyn Borchers all turned in
good performances on vault
(Vaughn), floor(Megi|l) and bars
(Borchers).

Although Yohman was pleased
with the win, there were some
disappointments. ’’l was really
disappointed with the judging.
The scoring was a little low in
some cases,” she said.

reserve guard Pat Cavanaugh in
the dogsled competition. As the
race reached Flagstaff Hill, a
husky on Cavanaugh’s team of
canines, Scruffy, accidentally
stepped on an l.C. Light beer tab
and cut its paw and was unable
to continue on. Acting quickly,
Cavanaugh unleashed the dog
from the team, bandaged its
wound and placed it in the sled,
then leashed himselfto the team
and continued the race in that
fashion. And to top it off,
Cavanaugh cooly tossed the cul-
prit beer tab into a refuse can 75
feet away.

After all that, Cavanaugh
finished a respectable third be-
hind Ed Bozik’s and Kirk Bruce’s
teams. And as more results come
in to us, we hope to keep you up
dated and informed on the rest of
today's action. For ABC Sports,
