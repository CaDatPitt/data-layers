SGB committees offer behind-the-sceneshelp 

Marissa Meredyth
Senior Staﬁ‘ Writer

The 2011 Student Government Boardhas almost
completed its ﬁrst semestefs worth of work —
with some serious behind-the—scenes help from
a handful of committees.

SGB committees and their leaders work in
conjunctionwith atleast one Board member and
play an active role in assisting the Board with its
various initiatives. Some committee chairs create
and implement projects of their own. A -

BoardPresidentMollyStiebersaidcommittee _'

chairs are appointed by the Board following an

application process. This year’s committee chairs
were selected from a pool of 30 applicants and

‘named during the Feb. 1 Board meeting. So far

they have introduced projects in areas ranging
from web design to student civic engagement ——
complementing the Board’s work.

Only three of the current nine standing com-
mittees are written into SGB’s constitution. These

include the Elections, Judicial and Allocations ‘

committees. The Board, however, has the option

A tocreate“adhoc”committees thatarecentered

on current Board members’ projects.
Here is a rundown of the standing commit-
tees, their leaders and the various projects each

Environmental Chairwoman Re-
becca Schroeder-ajuniormajoring
in environmental studies as well as

dents could see some of her projects
being implemented in the Fall.

Schroederhasbeenworkingclose- '

ly with Board members Emily Hoover

and Ryan Gayman on a “green check- l

list” initiative. that student groups
will submit with allocation request
forms. ' ’ _ .
“For now,thiswould actas more of
a survey to indicate to us what student
groupsaredoingsustairiablyandwhat
they might not be that we might be
able to change,” Schroeder said in an
e-mail. “Also, we hope that it makes
them think more about sustainable
practices whenplanning the logistics
for their events.”

On—campus fraternity houses will
also receive recyclingbins soon, com-
pliments of an Environmental Com-
mittee project.

Elections

Elections has also completed the
legwork onanumber of initiativesthis
semester.

KariRosenkaimer—ajunior ma-

joring in psychology, who currently
serves as Elections chairwoman — is
working on making freshman more
aware of SGB elections to hopeﬁilly
increase voter turnout in the fall.
Additionally, she wants to spread
knowledge aboutthe electionprocess,
so if a student group memberwishes to
runfor SGB, hewill know how.
Stude_nttumoutinBoard elections
remains low, although it increased
from13 percent in2oo9 to almost 19
percent in 2010, when Lena Wicken-
den held the position.
Judicial e
Judicial Chairmanjohn Cole, work-
ingwith Rosenkaimer, hopes to imple-
ment last year’s failed change to the
SGB Constitution that would allow
students to vote for all eight Board
members, an increase from the cur-
rent ﬁve votes allowed. _
Cole — a sophomore who’ is
majoring in psychology — said the

' resolution will be voted on through a

campus-wide referendum during the
next election.
Governmental Relations
- Kyle Miller, Governmental Rela-
tions chairman, said Pitt Day in Har-

 his largest project by far, -

but his work isn’t completely done.
Thisyear’s Pitt Daytookplaceinearly
April and featured a‘bus.t1'ip to Har-

risburg for students to lobby against
education ﬁmding cuts.

Miller — a junior majoring in
political science and history —— said
he will continue to lobby against Re-
publican Gov. Tom Corbett’s proposed
budget cuts to higher education. He
will also work on voter registration
and get-out-the-vote efforts for the
‘municipal primary as well as gene
elections. —
’ Public Relations .
Public Relations Chairman Alex
Amati —,—. a sophomore majoring in
marketing and ﬁnance — said his
main goal has been to inform the Sill-
dent body of the Board’s lobbying ef-
forts over the proposed budget cuts.
“‘For the ﬁiture, I plan on getting
SGB involved with students and stu-
dent groups in a nonprofessional, out-
of-the-oﬂice way to build up moral
and support for elections come next
fall,” he said.‘ /

Alexander Zimmerman as Academic
Affairs chairwoman.

‘ She isworkingonextendinglibrary
hours, introducing an international

number of classes that satisfy gen-
eral education requirements — one
of Zimmerman’s popular campaign
promises. _ ’

Patel said she is still in the talking

if phases,butthatthe administrationhas

been willing to listen to her ideas.

“International” relations will be
deﬁnitely a long-term project, as it
_requires quite a bit to implement a
new major,” she said.

Award recipients are chosen based on world‘

V; ' reputation in their disciplines, but also on the

effect their disciplines have had on academia in
general, said Robert Brandom, a°co—worker of
McDowell’s who received the award in 2003.
Brandom described McDowell’s achieve-
ments and interests as broad, but also unusually
expert on all topics that he has written about.

-‘ Brandomwas the head of the Pitt philosophy
department when McDowell came to Pitt in
1986, and he said McDowell was well—known
as a world-class philosopher. At that time, Mc-
Dowell held a bachelor’s degree in philosophy
from Oxford, but nothing more.

Brandom explained that McDowell’s degree ~

makes his achievements even more impres-

sive. ’ . ' _ ' 4
“He doesn’t have a doctorate, but obtained

a permanent faculty position at Oxford by the

age of 23,” Brandom said.
McDowell’s studies focus on the work of phi-
losophers, such as Immanuel Kant and Ludwig

Wittgenstein, and the philosophy of the mind-

and language, but he is also interested in “ques-
tions that arise because of the idea thathuman
beings are special, among animals, in being re-
sponsive to reasons,”.as he has said. .

McDowell explained at the time of his un-
dergraduate education, British professors were
not expected to have a graduate educaﬁon. His
lack of a doctoral degree did not stop him from

‘ ‘obtaining faculty positions at both Oxford and

Pitt.

McDowell teaches undergraduate courses for
the School of Arts 8: Sciences, as well as courses
for Pitt’s graduate philosophy program.

Graduating Pitt Ph.D. studentjoshua Stuchlik
worked with McDowell on his dissertation on
philosophy of action. I . _ _

' McDowell’s book, “Mind and World,” in-
spired Stuchlik to attend Pitt for his Ph.D. in
philosophy in order to work directly with Mc-
Dowell. _

"‘He has been both an inspiration and a
mentor to me,” Stuchlik said. “Taking one of
his graduate seminars, .you truly feel you are in
the presence of a great philosopher.”

In 1991, McDowell also received the honor of A

McDowell makes
sense for students

deliveringthejohn Lockeseries oflectures, which
Brandom said is the most prestigious lecture
series in the philosophy ﬁeld.

As an educator, McDowell offers discussions
that leave his students impressed with his ability
to dissect arguments and philosophical theory.

“The thing that most impresses me about
his teaching is his ability to take a bad argument
that looks compelling and carefully dissect it to
show exactly how it goes wrong — usually in a
surprising way,” Stuchlik said.

Senior Adam Jones is currently taking Wit-
tgenstein, acourse McDowell teaches.Jones de-
scribes McDowell’s teaching style as advanced.

“He’_ll startwith somethingthatwittgenstein
wrote. Then he will try to explain it. The ideas
always seem so abstract, and then he reaches
some conclusion and we are all just like, ‘aha,
okay,”’Jones said. ‘

“He is the smartest. I have never seen him
make any mistakes; never seen him stumble
over his words,” Jones said, “It is just abstract
thoughts, directly turned to words.”

Despite its abstract concepts, McDowell de-
scribes philosophy as a fun discipline.

“My usual View is that the questions turn out
to be unreal when we think them through, so it
isn’t surprising that they have no answers,” Mc-
Dowell said. “It’s rewarding to understand why
smart people think there are questions where
there really aren’t.” A

Brandom said when McDowell was ﬁrst of-
fered the job at Pitt, he required one very speciﬁc
condition to be ﬁilﬁlled. ’

“Their cat — Archie — needed to come with
them, and they were not keen on him riding
in cargo. So, little Archie McDowell got to ride
to Pittsburgh in his own seat on the airplane,”

He said that the research was very interest-
ing, and that he was excited about the prospect
of working on a research project that could yield
such big discoveries.

“The sequence of my genome is goingto affect
my life,” he said, ‘And understanding how those
changes work is something we’re very bad at.”

 

He said that understanding how genetic

Frenchburqa ban
sets bad example

or some, France might

conjure up images of top-

less beaches, impeccable
fashion and free-ﬂowing armpit
hair. V '

But more recently, France
now conjures up images of rac-
ism and intolerance. At least for
us it does.

A law went into effect yester-
day banning Islamic burqas and
niqabs in the country. Breaking
that law results in a 15o—euro (or
$215) ﬁne, CNN reports. In addi-
tion, “forcing a woman to wear a
niqab or burqa is punishable by a
year in prison anda 30,oo0—euro
ﬁne (about $43,300)?’ The ban
also applies to foreigners visiting
France, according to The New
York Times.

Because France’s constitution
protects freedom of religion, we
ﬁnd this ban unacceptable. ’

For a country so progressive
in so many other ways —— such
as health care — this law takes
France a serious step back and
gives all of Europe a bad name.
After all, it was only a few de-
cades ago that some European
countries were prosecutingjews
and Roma —- the latter known
colloquially as gypsies. _

The law alienates migrants
rather than integrating them in
a nation that is cherished for its
multiculturalism. This alienation
is dangerous as it potentially en-
courages extremists rather than
moderates.

And for what purpose? What
interest does the ban serve?

The New York Times reports
that France’s President Nicolas
Sarkozy said, “The burqa is not
welcome in France because it is
contrary to our values and con-

trary to the ideals we have of a
woman’s dignity.”

And whereas some Muslim
women support the ban, those
who practice Islam have the
choice of whether they want to
wear the garment or not. France
takes the choice‘ away.

In addition, the bill is de‘-
fended on grounds of public se-
curity. ' - ‘

‘But France is not a country
generally suffering from extrem-
ist attacks. The United Kingdom
— which has suffered from ex-
tremist attacks more often —— did
not implement a similar ban indi-
cating that there are options for
public security other than limit-

_ ing freedoms.

According to ‘CNN, French
people supported the ban by a
ratio of more than 4—to -1 whereas
two out of three ‘Americans op-
posedit. Regardless of the clear
cultural gap that exists between’

the American and French popu-~ '
'lations, we can’t help but fear

the international implications
of such a ban.

This ban sets a precedent for

other countries and also damages
international relations — par-
ticularly with France serving as
a member of the European Union
and United Nations.
A USA Today reports that the
Muslim population is growing
at a faster rate than all other re-
ligious groups combined. For
a country to be passing racist
policies unsuccessfully disguised
as public safety to such a large
portion of the population is dis-
appointing in a nation that has
— until recently — taken such
great stridesin tolerance. I

We must be delusional!

L_EX AND THE-_GITY

HOW to succeed in blogging

_ Lexie Bond
Assistant Opinions Editor

So_me people say‘ blogs are on the

way out faster than fanny packs.

I don’t’really know much about A

trends, so I have no idea. I might
even be wearing a fanny pack now.
What can I say? It complements my
socks and sandals. _ _

But what I do have is an idea
about what makes a blog success-
ﬁll. This column will outline tips
for succeeding in blogging without
really trying, and it will also pro-
vide-examples of blogs that I think
properly illustrate the elements of
a good site.-

Offer a service — Unless you are

I a stunt double, your day-to—day ac-

tivities probably aren’t interesting
enough for people to want to read
about. Therefore, it’s best to "offer
some soft of service to your reader.

If I’ve picked up useful information -

from a blog before, I’m probably
more likely to come back.

Case in point: howsweeteats.
com. A Pittsburgh blogger, Jessica
from How Sweet brings a lot to the
table in terms of cupcake recipes
that will requireyou to bust out
your stretchy pants. You’ll also ﬁnd
plenty of recipes involving bacon
and chocolate — not necessarily

up together, but I wouldn’t rule it out.

One thing you probably won’t ﬁnd

o

is any recipe involving a vegetable.

Unless, of course, it’s smothered in

bacon or chocolate. _
Be attractive —- If you’re not

going to offer a service, this rule is

really important. From what I’ve
seen, one of the main purposes of
blogging is to just wh*re yourself
out there as much as possible. By
having 'a blog, you’re basically say-
ing, “I consider myself so special
that you should spend less time liv-
ing your life and more time reading
about mine.” And if that’s the case,
you better be nice to look at. ‘
Case in point: jseverydayfash-
ion.com.J offers a service by post-

ing about affordable fashion evel'y- _

day, and she also has the advantage
of being tall, tan, thin, blonde and
gorgeous. Sure she sells fashion, but
I’m sure she sells it better by looking
like a Floridian goddess. '

Be hilarious — If you have noth-
ing to offer the world and you hit
every branch falling out of the ugly
tree, you can still succeed in blog-
ging if you’re.ﬁ1nny. Sure, people
visit blogs for new information, but
they also want to be entertained.

Case in point: rachelwilkerson.
com. Rachel’s blog features her own
life lessons, but that’s not what
keeps people reading. She offers ex-
tremely ﬁmny, insight on topics like
whether it’s OK to get McDonald’s

breal(fast«.’after a night of drinking ‘
or who-should sleep on the wet spot.

on the bed aftersex. She’s just your
average Michigander-gone-Texan,
so it’s important for her to be ﬁmny.
I mean, why else would anyone care
about her life lessons?’

Post bikini pictures — I’ve re-
alized that everyone, and I mean
everyone, wants to look at every-

’ one else in a bikini. Men want to _

look at women in bikinis; women
want to look at women in bikinis;
and if a man put on a‘ bikini we’d
look at that, too. It doesn’t matter
if it’s pleasant or unpleasant '— we
just need to see what it looks like.’
If it looks good, we’re turned on, or
jealous, or motivated or. all three.
If it looks bad, we judge, we share
with others, we somehow feel better
about ourselves. You just can’t go
wrong posting bikini pictures.
‘ Case in point: theskinnyweb-’
site.com. This website actually has
a tab at the top for “celebs in biki-
nis,” which I ﬁnd myself frequent-
ing more than the other tabs. And
yes, I enjoy the unpleasant bikini
pictures just as. much, if not more,
than the pleasant ones. After all,
what made her think she had busi-
ness in a bikini, anyway? ‘ ,
Be unique ,—' Let’s‘ be real.
Chances are, someone else is blog-

- ging about the same thing you’re

blogging about, and they’re proba-
bly doing itbetter. So unless you are

TUESDAYS WITH MOLLY

Santorum Won’t care about the country

Molly Green
Columnist

  

Apparently, a dog once relieved itself
on former Sen. Rick Santorum. Upon
hearing this —— and as someone who
has often had atenuous relationship
with canines because of my lifelong
affection for cats —— I felt endeared to
the species for the ﬁrst time ever.
Santorum, a 2012- presidential
contender, recounted this story to
a group of GOP activists at the Spar-
tanburg County Republican Conven-

tionlastweek,accordingto_Politico. l

com. I suppose it was some sort of

attempt to garner some chuckles and '

show he’s just an average guy rather
thanavery self-interestedpolitician,
which he is. V

For those who don’t know Santo-
rum or don’t rememberhim— lucky
you. I remember all too clearly his
dark reign as a senator in Pennsyl-
vania —° which was noted more for
his outrageous and unapologetic
comments than his movement of
legislation.

I don’t"dislike Santorum so ve-
hemently because he is conserva-
tive andI am liberal. We disagree on

nearly every issue — abortion, gay 

rights, immigration, foreign policy,
Social Security and the list goes on.
But this is the United States, and I
understand that not-everyone, shares
my political beliefs. »

In fact, there are plenty of conser— ‘

vatives who I respect, despite such
diﬁerences of opinion — Mitt Rom-
ney, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R—Ky.,
Sen. Jim DeMint, R—S.C., and, yes,
even George W. Bush — because I
believe they care about their con-
stituents and believe their policies
will create a better country. '

I can’t say the same for Santo-
rum.

Never mind that he believes that

the legislative branch should have
power over the Supreme Court.
Never mind that he blamed the
people and culture of Boston for that
clergy-sexual-abuse scandal. >
Never mind that he wrote a bill
that would, in effect, prohibit the
National Weather Service from pro-
viding information to the public, in-

stead forcing them to pay for- such '
intel from a private-sector company, .

such as Accuweather —— conveniently
based out of State College, Pa. ' ‘
Never mind thatlsantorum and
his“wifé,”Karen, brought hornétiie
deceased fetus of their prematurely
born son so thattheir childrencould

spend the night withit, as 'detailed

ton, D.C. .
Here’s where it gets sketchy. Five
of Santorum’s seven children attend-
ed the Western Pennsylvania Cyber
Charter School, and 80 percent of
that tuitionwas paid for by the Penn
Hills School District, costing Penn
Hills taxpayers $38,000 per year, ac-

‘ cording to the Post-Gazette. And let’s

just say Penn Hills is no Mt. Lebanon
when it comes to money.

was notaPenn Hills resident and thus
should refund the money, Santorum
refused, and the state Department
of Education settled the dispute by
paying$55,000 to the school district,

. .. Santorum is the Worst
of the GOP presidential

in Karen’s book “Letters to Gabriel:
The True Story of Gabriel Michael
Santorum.” P " l_

What I can’t forget '— and what
I hope the rest of Pemisylvania has
not forgotten — is Santorum’s bla-

tantdisrespectandabuseofhis own _ .

constituents. »

-I’m speaking, of course, about
the Pennsylvania residency contro-
versy. Forthose who don’t remember,
whereas Santorum maintained ale-
gal address in Penn Hills, Pa., - a
tl1ree-bedroom house purchased for
$87,800—he, aswellashiswife and
children, spent the majority of their
time in a $643,000 house, located
in a Virginian suburb of Washing-

fcontenders —- "save for
maybe Donald Trump. ...

according to the Post— Gazette.

Santorum paid nothing, and con-
tinuedtothinkhewas inthe right on ’
this matter.

Given this, Santorum is the worst
of the GOP presidential contenders
— save for maybe Donald Trump
— because, frankly, he cares about
the people in this country about as
much as the average American cares
about algae or the most recent “X-
Files” movie.

For now, Santorum is a dark
horse. But then again, when The
Donald announced the possibility
of running for president, I laughed
my ass off. Now, according to a re-
cent NBC/Wall Streetjoumal poll,

he is tied with Arkansas Gov. Mike
Huckabee for second place with GOP
voters,with 17 percent. MittRomney
had 21 percent.

This scares me.

What’s more, according to P0-
litico, “Santorum scored a decisive
victory in a straw poll held Saturday
among Republicans in South Caro-
lina’s ‘largest county,” by receiving

v 31 percent of the votes.
V Ultimately, when the school dis- .
trict’s board argued that Santorum

If Boston is the “seat of academic,
political and cultural liberalism in
America” (Santorum’s words,.not
mine), then South Carolina —- one
could argue — is the conservative
yin to Boston’s yang, as well as be-

V ing the ﬁrst Southern state to vote

in the primary elections, making it
very inﬂuential. »

Santorum is making the rounds
in other states, too. According to the
Boston Herald, Santorumhasvisited
New Hampshire 12 times; Iowa and
South Carolina 13 times each and
Nevada once. "

In essence — don’t underestimate
Santorum’s position in this race.

The night Democratic Sen. Bob
Caseyjr. defeated Santorum almost
ﬁve years ago is still a vivid memory
for me. He lost by almost20 percent-

, age points, according to the Post-

Gazette, the largest margin of defeat
ever for ‘an incumbent Republican
Senator in Pennsylvania.

That night I was proud to be a
Pennsylvanian —— I should mention
that on the same night, Rep. Jason
Altmire, D-Pa.,' defeated the vile
Melissa Hart; way to go District 4!
Pennsylvania might be a swing state
that ﬁnds appeal in some of Santo-
rum’s social policies, but it doesn’t
take sh*t.

Hopeﬁilly the rest of the country
won’t, either.

At the intersection of religious

the winners of the Laasya inter-
collegiate Indian classical dance
competition: Nrityamala.

“These dances originated in
temples to tell these stories and
praise certain gods and goddess,”
said Shobhitha Ravi, captain of
Pitt’s classical Indian dance team,
Nrityamala. “Now it’s come out

Cold Cave LP  
abounds in contrasts

Swarna Sunkara
For The Pitt News

Cold Cave
Cherish the Light Years
Matador Records

Rocks like: Melodramatic goth- O

rock with an uptempo edge
Grade: B+ A

Exhilaratingly experimental is the
" ‘ begfway to describe Cold "c:.i<ie’§"

new album, C/Jeri;/J the Light Years.
Compared to the band’s 2009
debut, Love Comes C/ore, Cberzlrb
2‘/ye Lzgbz‘ Year; is much more self-
” assured, and the variety and range
of the album merit praise.
Cold Cave began as the solo
project of Wesley Eisold, a New
“ York City-based artist. Currently,
Eisold is the project’s singer and
songwriter, as well as the band’s
main director — although he also
often works with a small core of
other musicians.

The ﬁrst ‘track. on C.‘/.7€7Z.J'5 16:5
Lzg/22‘ Ye_a7‘.l', “The Great Pan is
Dead,” sounds like a statement,
with its powerful guitar chords,
radiant synths and emotional vo-
cals. In fact, in a blurb on his band’s
Tumblr, the singer wrote that the
song is about “magic, preserva-
tion, youthand movement” —
themes, he says, that encompass
everything his music and career

are about.

The song is, indeed, a blend of '

his previous and present sound,’
but it falls short of being a suitable
artistic thesis for his music, which
is characterized by change, variety
and a sense of restlessness that is
too ﬂuid to epitomize. Neverthe-
less, its bursting energy under-
neath a layer of emotional terror
— a sound that permeates all songs
on the album ——.is so gripping that

"it leaves‘ thelistener breathless. ’

Throughout the LP, dark poetry
underlies the intense score and

provides a melodramatic undef-

tone to Eisold’s goth-rock sensibili-
ties. His voiceoften sounds more
forced than raw.in this album,
however, which detracts from the
pathos he attempts to achieve.

From beginning to end, the
passion and variety of C/yerisb I/Je

to forget — and sometimes, hard

‘Love child’ an
exhilarating riot

Ella Riot
Love Child
Independent Release
Rocks Like: Passion Pit, of Man-
. treal, LMFAO
Grade: A

Mixing of Montreal’s frantic funk,
a touch of ’80s pop and the in-
die rock sensibility of groups like
Passion Pit, Ann Arbor, Michi-
gan, group Ella Riot — formerly

known as My Dear Disco — is
dancing its collective ass off while
kicking out some serious jams.

On Love Child, the group.
seems to. be making a deﬁning
statement about its sound, of-
ten skating on the edge of pum
pop—ecstasy with Michelle Cha-
muel’s cotton-candy vocals flow-
ingthrough trippy synths and a
rockin’ backbeat.

“Just One Way” moves like
an outtake by a Pat Benatar who
grew up on the Killers. Synthi-E
sized slabs are woven with up-
tight notes to make the strong,

TONY’S TOP 10

:\Vithout popular sports, fans need entertained during summer  

~MCTiCampus
Tiger Woods nearly completed a comeback at the Masters and seems
to have returned to the good graces of sports fans.

Tonyjovenitti
Senior Staff Writer

 

Its almost summertime, and that

means three of America’s_most
popular professional sports will
be on hiatus. Football is over —

' and might not return next year

because of a possible lockout -
and the NHL and NBA seasons
are winding down. So what’s a
sports fan to.do over the sum-
mer_?

Well, that’s why I’m here,

of course. I give you the top 10

sports to watch this summer.

10. Golf. In uncanny uni-
son, it appears that the nation
has jumped back on the Tiger
Woods bandwagon. Apparently,
just enough time has passed since
his sex scandal ‘that he is like-

-able again. I guess that means‘

the world will like Ben 'Roeth-
lisberger again in a few months.

" Woods -nearly completed an in-

credible comeback at the Masters
this weekend, and golf suddenly

got interesting again.

9. Tennis. This is an under—_

appreciated sport in the United

-States.‘It’s one of the most physi-
cally demanding athletic events,
as a tennis match can last several
hours, and players don’t have the
luxury of substitutions. If you’re
looking to see some live tennis,
you don’t need to go to New
York and splurge on tickets for
the U.S. Open’. There is actually
a professional tennis league that
features some great stars. The
Washington Kastles in D.C.ihave
signed the Williams sisters for
the summer, so you have a chance
to see legends without spending

_ a ridiculous amount of money V

on tickets.

8 . Baseball. There is still
one major professional sport in
season over the summer. And oh
yeah, it’s America’s national pas-
time. Sure, baseball can be bor-
ing, but nothing says summer like
spending $9 to sit in s.calding hot
bleachers in the outﬁeld at PNC
Park. Also, the Pitt baseball team
is pretty good this season. It’s
currently 19-11 and it just opened
up a beautiful’ new stadium atop
the hill in the Petersen Sports
Complex. P '

- 7. UFC. Mixed martial arts

have blown up in the past few

years. The ﬁghts can get pretty
intense, and if ESPN is a good
gauge, then plenty of Americans
are watching. Maybe it’s time to
see what all the fuss is about.

6 0 Quidditch. I know what
you’re thinking: Quidditch isn’t
a real sport. But don’t tell that
to the people who gather on
"the Cathedral of Learning lawn
to play. J.K. Rowling’s fictional
sport is officiallylnonfiction.

Leagues are popping up all over '

the country. Why not hop on the
bandwagon?

. 5' ' 3
5 .0 Softball. In addition to a

beautiful new baseball stadium
at the top of the hill, Pitt also

opened 'a new softball stadium. -

The women’s softball team is hav-
ing a great season. With a 24-11
record, the team has already
broken the single—season home

run record with its 33rd homer P
last weekend. Take a hike up the ,

hill and go see the Panthers ‘in
action. '

4. Soccer. I’ll admit, I
don’t know much about soccer, ‘

— other than the fact that ev-

ery country besides the United .

States is obsessed with it. ESPN

In each of the three games,
falling behind seemed to wake
up the Pitt bats. After trailing in
the first game, Pitt exploded for a

“combined 14 runs throughout the
next three innings, as the lineup

turned a two-run deﬁcit into a

commanding 15-6 win.

“We were very patient and dis-
ciplined at the plate,” Pitt head
coach Joe jordano wrote in an e-

““'i’nail. “We knew what to expect,
and we were ready for it.

It took a Villanova lead to.

of the doubleheader, as well. It
took a while for the Panthers to
(gfigure out Villanova pitcher Kyle
Helisek, but once they did,_the
ﬂoodgates opened.
Seniors John Schultz, Smith
and_'David Chestertjtll reached

base to begin the bottom of the
seventh inning, and Villanova
pulled Helisek. _

But the Helisek couldn’t stop
the Pitt rally, and the damage

_ wasn’t ﬁnished until Smith’s sec-

ond at—bat of the inning resulted
in two more Pitt runs, which made
the score 7-3. A ‘

Although the Panthers were
happy with the two wins on Sat-
urday, they refused to settle for-
anything less than a sweep.

“We try not to let one day af-

. feet the next day, win or lose,”

Jordano wrote. “We were in an
identical situation against Notre
Dame last weekend and had the
lead late in [Sunday’s] game, but
lost.”

It was pitching that made the
difference in the third game.

Pitt freshman Ethan Mildren
went eight innings and allowed
only two runs, both of which were
scored in the first, to pick up his

third win of the ‘season.

Down 2-0 in the second, Pitt

scored at least one run in ﬁve
straight innings. Freshman Casey
Roche pounded three hits, and
seniors Chester and Konieczny

each drove in two runs to pace

leads the league at 7-2.

He led_ the Big East with nine RBIs

and seven runs while hitting .409
and earning more than one hit in
four of the ﬁve games. Defensive-
ly, he didn’t commit any errors.

Smith leads the conference
with a .419 batting average,
while fellow senior Zach Duggan
is third in the Big East with at
.368. Chester is also in the top
10 in the conference in batting

career—best in the discus competition. '

The men’s throwers also competed in "

Arizona, with senior Garrett Larkin and
junior Dan Kwiatkowski ﬁnishing eighth
and 10th, respectively, in the shot. put
event. ‘ . .

Larkin said the warm weather and the

long trip made the competition difficult‘

for the athletes in Arizona.

“Overall, we were pretty happy as. a
group,” he said. “We were able to overcome
the. conditions we were in and succeed,
which I think says a lot about us.” A

There were no team scores tallied at
either of the meets. ,

While Webb is aware of the improve-
ments that the team needs to make as a
whole, he isconﬁdent that those changes
will occur soon. V

“We improve upon little things at each
meet, and these wereno different,” Webb
said. “We are not quite at the point where
everyone is at the level they need to be at
the same time to put together a complete

best throw in discus  

meet.” .

Webb, who is in his ninth year of coach-
ing at Pitt, traditionally looks to the up-
coming April 22 Morgan State Legacy Meet
for a standout performance.

“When we travel to Morgan State, I usu-
ally look for things to come together,”
Webb said. “Prior to that, we have pieces, of
success but not a whole team success.”

Webb’s athletes agree with him in re-
gard to piecing together a complete meet

and for Hill, it has a lot to do with a united

team focus. . E

“The biggest improvement I have seen
in the team so far is.in o'ur attitudes,” Hill
said. “We are all on the same page and
have a common goal, which is to win the

‘ Big East.” ‘

Both the women’s and men’s teamswill
look to continue toward that goal next
weekend at the Bison Outdoor Classic in
Lewisburg, Pa.,'and the Sea Ray Relays in
Knoxville, Tenn.‘ -

Footie anAustralian pastime

think there are about 431 different leagues,
andeach player plays in four different
leagues, then they all play each other in
_“friendly” matches, followed by interna-
tional play where the players go play for

their home country. ‘I don’t know if soc— i

ther end, and the aim of the game is to

‘ kick the ball through the center for six
‘ points or through the outside posts for

one point-. Players can make an attempt

tion never stops. This might be the most

hope it jumps across the ‘Paciﬁciand into
