Dorm Party Regulations Set

Resident students who have
large parties in their dorm rooms
now must serve an alternative
beverage along with alcohol,
supply an adequate amount of
food for guests and not charge
admission.

Those Office of Residence Life
(ORL) policies concerning parties
were announced to dorm residents
at floor meetings this past week.
Under the policies, residents
holding dorm parties must:

0 Have all members of the suite
hosting the party sign an event
responsibility sheet. This holds
them responsible for any damage
costs incurred by guests, requires
them to clean up after the party,
and holds them accountable for the
actions of their guests;

0 Provide an alternative
beverage at a party for those who
don’t want to drink alcohol;

0 Supply food refreshments at
the party;

0 Collect no money at the door
for the party.

Assistant director of ORL
Brenda Zagorac said the
regulations are designed to
encourage responsible drinking
and to prevent any problems from
occurringat large parties.

“People getting together and
having a good time is wonderful,”
Zagorac said. “But we don’t want
problems in the residence halls. We
always try to take a protective
approach and prevent problems
before they develop.”

The reason for the prohibition
on collecting money for parties is
that a resident must have a
mercantile license in order to do
that, according to Zagorac.

She added that the regulations
are not new.

“We’ve decided to emphasize
them this year,” she said.

Resident Assistants will enforce
the policies. McCormick RA Bob

Peters explained that the RA’s
conduct two tours of the floors each
night, and they will check parties
to see if the regulations are being
followed.

Students who violate the policy
may have their party privilege

‘ revoked or face “a small, restricted

type of punishment,’.’ Peters said.
Zagorac is confident the regula-
tions will be effective.
“We’re only asking mature college
students to do what they think is
reasonable,” Zagorac said.
The regulations, however, were
developed by the ORL staff
without student input. _]ay Nalli,

president of. the Resident Student ‘
V Association (RSA), said individual

RSA members have heard
complaints about the policy.
“They went through ORL
without anyone knowing about
them," Nalli said.
The RSA, however, is taking no
stand on the regulations, he said.

Geography

Future
In Limbo

By LAURIE MocLEOD

« A sub-committee of the Univer-
sity Senate held closed meetings
Wednesday and Thursday to dis-
cuss Faculty of Arts and Sciences

dean Jerome Rosenberg’s proposal.

to terminate the geography depart-
ment.

Committee chairman David
Engel said the committee is
required to issue a statement con-
cerning its recommendation
within a month.

Rosenberg proposed terminat-
ing the department, citing low
enrollment figures, departmental
overlap and research quality as
reasons.

That proposal must be approved
by Chancellor Wesley Posvar
before it can become. eﬂective.

The University Senate, however,
has 30 days to study Rosenberg’s
proposal and make its recommen-
dation about the department’s
future.

The committee consists of chair-
man Engel, Mary Scialabba, pro-
fessor of microbiology Robert
Atchinson, black st idies professor
Richard Blackett and Henry Block
of the mathematics department.

The committee will hear opin-
ions from, among others, former
geography chairman Hibberd
Kline, recommended chairman
Edward Muller and history profes-
sor Seymour Drescher, a member of
the Senate’s Social Science
Council.

After hearing these opinions the

committee will write a recommen- l

dation accepting or rejecting the
termination proposal.

This recommendation will be
sent to the Executive Senate Com-
mittee, chaired by Richard Tobias,
and then must be passed by Provost
Rhoten Smith before going to
Chancellor Wesley Posvar.

Geography graduate student
Mark Ozark said the students
involved have not yet been polled
on their opinions of the termina-
tion proposal and “they probably
won’t (be).”

He said there is an assumption
that the students’ opinions are
expressed through credit hours. He
is in the process of calculating the
student credit hours per faculty
member. Ozark said.

A supportive three and a half
page letter from the Association of
American Geographers to Provost
Smith stated that the number of
student credit hours per faculty
member was more than 150 percent
greater than the average for all
social sciences from 1978-80.

The Association said they have
been following the events leading
up to the termination proposal.

“The actions of the University of
Pittsburgh to terminate the
Department of Geography should
send an alarm to all scholars on
campus that in the wake of budget
restrictions their professional
future may be in jeopardy,” the
Association's letter said.

Forum:

——Page 3

Era

or

is Pitt’s Campus Conservative?

Remember the 19603? If you’re in

college today, you probably only~

remember kindergarten, the tooth
fairy and your first little league game
when you think back almost 20
years. But, of course, you've heard
enough about the period from

documentaries, “Edie" and your

older sister who used to live in a
commune. Anyway, Forum took the
trouble this week to find out what
people think of "today's college
students—are we as boring as
everyone says we are? Is it our fault or
just part of the natural cycle?

Scott Rex
Progressive Student
Network

Scott Rex, a senior com-
munications major, believes it is
accurate to characterize most
campuses as conservative.

He believes this conservativism is
caused in part by the actions of the
19605. '

“We saw at Kent State that our
own government was willing to shoot
people," Rex said. “That changed a
lot of minds about doing things. It's
one thing to stand up for what you
believe in, but it’s another thing to die
for it."

Rex said that although some
campus politicalgroups have either
formed or become active lately,
“most of them are still in the
mainstream of politics."

He would like to see the campus
newspaper concern itself with more
commentary on issues of national
concern. In addition, Rex thinks the
Student Government Board should
deal “with larger issues than
homecoming ﬂoats.

“I don't think students should be

protesting in the streets," Rex said.
“But I think they should at least make

. an effort to know what is going on in

the world."

Linda Hausman, an SGB member
and former chairman ofﬂthe
Commuter Affairs Committee,
thinks students have adopted
conservative attitudes that hamper
them when they deal with
administrators. But, she explained,
apathy is a problem as well.

She cited a low turnout at last
year's forum on student aid cuts as
an example.

Hausman also mentioned that
because the campus is made up of a
large number of commuters, there is
a problem encouraging student
activism.

“Commuters have a lot of outside
responsibilities," Hausman said.
“They don't have the time to really
get involved in what's going on.”

in addition, Hausman said student
groups and leaders are “deﬁnitely
conservative."

“in the past decade, the
administration has gotten the upper
hand over the students. lt gets worse
every year. I truly think the

administration believes it doesn't
have a responsibility to students,"
Hausman said.

She said student failures on the
visitation policy and the increase in
the health fee are examples of how
the administration ignores student
concerns.

According to Hausman, part of the
problem lies with the student leaders‘
being overly concerned about an
image rather than a cause.

She believes students can work
within the administration and still
accompllish their goals. Hausman
said students have to be persistent,
draw attention to problems and not
become discouraged.

 Smith
Director of Student
Activities

Andy Smith, director of student
activities, said the students that Pitt

draws are largely conservative, partly
because of their family backgrounds

and because they follow the national
political trend toward con-
servativism.

This differs from the ’60s and early
'70s in that “students then were
concerned about social issues. How
they are more concerned with their
own welfare and their position in the
job market."

The changes in attitudes, Smith
believes, are the result of natural
changes in trends: periods of
activism are often followed by less
active times.

"it's evolution,” Smith said.
"Personally, I found campuses more

alive when students were more

interested in social issues.”

He said students during that time
were more active in moving into
communities and working on
programs to aid them, such as
tutoring. /
programs here," Smith said. "Butwe
tutor ourselves, not the community.”

Smith added he would not '" be
surprised to see changes again in the
way students involve themselves in
politics.

Career Seminar Planned

By DON SIMKOVICH

Consumer advocate Ralph
Nader, resume and interview work-
shops and an employers fair for lib-

- eral arts candidates are part of this

year‘s career seminar.

The seminar, which will be held
Oct. 4 through 7, offers studetns
information about requirements
for technical and other career
fields.

“The purpose of the seminar is
to bring all students in the univer-
sity and surrounding community
to an awareness of the different
careers available,” said Linda

Cohen, student coordinator for the
seminar.

Cohen said that the seminar is
especialy helpful for students who
are unsure about what kind of
career they want.

“A lot of kids come in to school
not knowing what they want Or
they‘re not happy with what
they’re studying," she said. “The
seminar gives them a chance to
learn more about possible careers."

This year's seminar will include
two new careers: robotics and laser
art, Cohen said.

In addition, the seminar will
include an employers fair for lib-
eral arts candidates. Such compan-

One Long Year

Doonesbury is l_eaving, and it isn’t “far-
freakin’ out” at all‘. ‘

Gary Trudeau, the Pulitzer-Prize winning
cartoonist, is giving up Doonesbury for a while,
and his satirical, but understanding, jabs at
politics and our changing fads will be missed.

Now who is left to illuminate our absurdities
and , help us laugh at ourselves and our
government? His investigtive cartoons were
special and in time with political happenings
such as Watergate, Reagan, Vietnam and cloak-
and-dagger comic operas on Capitol Hill, in
addition to trendy preoccupations with plants,
communes, recreational drugsand the pursuit‘
of the perfect tan. J

He took risks when he poked fun at politicos
and politics, and once, his strip concerning the
search for Reagan’s brain was conspicuously-
absent from several papers. That was due, no
"loubt, to touchy and slightly cowardly editors.

In an offbeat way, he informed us, and the
worry is—now who will? In these , times, .
journalists, for one reason or another—the fear
of being labeled a “new liberal” or the recent
attempts to redefine the First Amendment and
national security-—are softer than usual. They
don’t criticize policies or politicians as strongly S
as they should.

Instead, they criticize each other when one of
the corps happens to touch a nerve-—note the
case of Texas journalist Sarah McClendon, who
dared to call the president’s bluff. Not only did
Reagan treat her with a condescending
manner—irritating in itself—but the other
journalists joined in the ridicule. So much for
an aggressive press.

An aggressive press is essential, if only to
keep politicians on their toes and aware that the
public knows who they are and what they are
doing. The idea is to report, not regurgitate. It
is ironic that some of the most straightforward
critical remarks come from the mouths of
cartoon character. Members of the press in the
Nixon years were not as afraid of calling bluffs
as they are now.

Consider Reagan’s economic policies,
budget cuts, defense strategies, and noticeable
lack of press conferences. Trudeau had the guts
to poke fun at the Reagan revelation that
ketchup could be a vegetable, but where was
everybody else? Journalists do not often point
out inconsistencies, in policy decisions, and
when they do, it is overly mild, almost
apologetic.

The New York Times, The Washington Post
and Doonesbury. Doonesbury was part of the
reading necessary to find out the current

Who’s To Blame For All This?

By scorr REX

The Babylon King, atop his

I white stallion, rides in solitude. He

smiles at the .TV cameras, telling
his people all is cool. In the land
that Jesus walked, Jews and Arabs
bury their latest dead. In El Salva-
dor, American bullets shatter
children's brains onto blood-
stained streets, courtesy of U.S. tax-
payers. Prophets with guitars cry
that governments all die, it’s all
just a matter of time. In New York,
angels in red roam subway ‘cars,
while ‘teen-agers carry lead to
school. “

Here at Pitt, opinions must fit
the standard journalistic rules.
University professors tell us to be
objective. Well, I’ve never yet met
one who is. Tell you what,
Freshmen—if you want that “A”
you'd best think the way they do.
The SDS is long dead, concern is
shown for Marino’s knees instead.
But the clouds that make rain pos-
sible are heavy and dark above our
heads.

The IRA blows up horses to
show'how effective they are, while
Arafat explains on the “Today”
show that he means no harm. Who
is in charge of this masquerade? I
want to talk with the main clown.
Why do we spend more than $19
million to overthrow a government
that taught its people to read?
Don’t tell_ me they're Commies
when only 7 percent of their trade is
with Communist bloc countries.
King Solomon would not survive

' around here.

I salute the Polish people for not
abandoning their quest to rid
themselves of Communist chains.
Why isn’t the CIA helping Solidar-
ity, or are they? I guess one never
knows. By the way, who killed
JFK?

If the rain falls we have only our-
selves to blame. We should get
some clues from German grand-
parents "to understand why we
never cared when there was still
time left to care.

One more thing, Freshmen-SGB
does not represent leaders, only
resume seekers. How many of them
stood out in the cold last winter,
collecting signatures against pro-
posed cuts in student aid? Not one.
They were much too busy for such
a pleasant task. Yet they discuss
how many floats each governance

group can have in the homecom-
ing parade. What a sham! Just once
in my four years at Pitt I would like
to see the SGB comment on some-
thing of more significance than
homecoming floats.

I also think that the freedom of
speech is one of the freedoms we
possess that make America what it
is. When I pick up The Pitt News
and see advertisements taking over

the substance of our paper, I’m dis-
appointed. Surely among all the
political science and English writ-
ing majors out there, a few must be
willing to keep this paper from
resembling the humdrumness that
characterises SGB members.

(Editor's note: Scott Rex is a senior
majoring in Speech/Rhetoric.)

fun than drinking beer,

But a friend of ours got cap-
tured and now he’s doing 30
years.

Maybe we should raise our
voices, ask somebody why.
But demonstrations are a drag,
and besides we’re much too
high. -

And I’m sure it wouldn’t inter-
est anybody outside of a small
circle of friends.—Phil Ochs

Some Pitt students like to
study, others like to party, and a
good number enjoy sleeping
during their spare time. But it
seems that one common activity
at Pitt is complaining. Not that
complaining, in and of itself, is

But complaints alone don't
cause change. Improvements
occur only after a complaint has
been transformed into action.
Sure, hundreds of people were
at a sit-in several years ago to
protest the latest version of the
visitation policy. And a lot of
people attended last year‘s SGB-
sponsored forum on financial
aid cutbacks. But those issues
specifically affected the stu-
dents who showed up. Similar
reactions didn't materialize
when the geography depart-
ment was disbanded, even
though this was as important
an issue as aid cutbacks or vis-
itation rights.

A letter to the editor of The

ing opinions is important for
personal growth and for imple-
menting change. But mostofus
are willing to let things slip
away from us, like the geo-
graphy department, and not
take action. We’ll complain
about it—after all, we’re not
apathetic, just lethargic. But we
don’t do anything to solve a
problem until it’s too late. This
year, it was the geography
department that was disbanded.
Next year, it might be yours,
and I’m sure it wouldn’t interest
anybody outside of a small cir-
cle of friends.

the chief engineer for campus
radio station WPGH.)

Ihe Go-G65 Grow up

 

‘ By JIM HOHMAN

In a recent article in Rolling
Stone, Steve Pond asserts that
the applause the Go-Go's
received at a Detroit concert
"wasn't for five comely girls but
a first—rate rock band.” Well, the

_ Go-Go's are comely, but a first
rate rock band? With memories
‘of their live spot on Saturday
Night Live, I couldn't help but
think Steve Pond a little biased
towards the Go-Go's. One has
to be fair; there were some
sound problems, but still——a
”first rate band?” I had my
doubts, at least as far as the G0-
Go's quality as a live band.

Now don't get me wrong. I
really love the group and have
been a fan ever since ”Our Lips
Are Sealed” first got some air-
play. Thus, I was more than wil—
ling to shell out the bucks for
tickets and gas to get to Blossom
Music Center, but I really didn't
expect too much of the Go-Go's
on stage.

With this attitude, I arrived at
Blossom and was undeniably
proved wrong. These ladies
really delivered! It was one of
the most entertaining concerts
I've been to. The band was sur-

, prisingly tight and seemed to be
just delighted to be playing for
the audience. The audience, in

 

By CHRISTOPHER APPLEGATE

we are in afairly sleazy nightclub in
a fairly sleazy section of Trujillo-
,Honduras. Pepe Hernandez, a fairly
sleazy local impresario, is about to
present his Parada de Estrellas, featur-
ing ”famous international cabaret
stars.” Not surprisingly, it turns out
to be a fairly sleazy show-—especially
considering that the ”international"
stars are all members of the Hernan-
dez family, under the sponsorship of
Hernadez’ uncle, manager of the
Trujillo Coca-Cola bottling plant. It is
also a perfectly delightful and wildly
funny evening in the theatre.

It is not necessary to book pasage
on a rickety Air Honduras DC—3 to
enjoy it,- either. El Grarzde de Coca—Cola
happens at the Pittsburgh Labora-
tory Theatre, 420 N. Craig St.,
through September 19. This very dif-
ferent musical revue was co-directed
by the team of Ken Gargaro and
Melanie Smith, who did Shakespeare on
Broadway for the Three Rivers Sha-
kespeare Festival this summer.

Gargaro and Smith prove them-
selves to be a winning team again, for

Coca—Cola presents a number of uni-k

que problems. The first is finding a
suitable cast. Coca-Cola is almost ludi-
crously demanding. Its actors must
dance, sing, perform on musical
instrumets, and all in a sort of ersatz
Spanish dialogue. Dont let this put
you off. Cora—CoIa's Spanish is attuned
to American ears. When a boot is pro-
duced (under outrageous circum-
stances), it is referred to as ”el booto.”

‘ Mark Vincent Morocco is nothing

its turn, was just as delighted to
be listening to the band.
I The group opened with
”Skidmarks On My Heart” from
Beauty And The Beat and played
songs from that album and their
new release, Vacation. The girls
were all in great form: lead sin-
ger Belinda Carlisle’s vocals
were often better than they
were on the albums (”Lust To
Love" and ”We Don't Get
Along," for example). In addi-
’tion', she seemed more confi-
dent and energetic. Gina Schock
anchored Lie band to her hard
driving, no-nonsense drum
playing, while, dancing around
the stage with seemingly limit-
less energy, Jane Wiedlin ‘
pounded out straight rhythm
guitar to which Charlott Caffey
added simple but effective leads.
The performances, rounded
out by Kathy Valentine's rock
steady bass, were just as good as '
or better than anything on the
two LPs. This bandwas hot and
had the audience in its hands.
When Carlisle yelled, ”Let’s
dance!,” the audience promptly
complied, and the ushers had to
move people back to their seats.
Of course, when ”We Got The
Beat” rolled around, even the
ushers were bouncing around.
The guest band was A Flock

$7‘/sans life!

short of superb as Senor Don Pepe
Hernandez. With the energy of a
steam locomotive, he offers us Span-
ish impressions of Jimmy Cagney and
E.T., a very funny Toulouse—Lautrec,
and a desperate attempt to keep the

J show going despite missed entrances,

flubbed cues, tempermental
actresses, and a hopelessly intoxi-
cated blues singer. Although Moroco
makes his performance look effort-
less, the sweat is literally streaming
off him by the end of the revue.
Michael J. Sherman is Miguel Her-
nandez, Pepe's nephew. Gifted with
cleft comic timing and an almost
bewilderingly diverse range, his per-
formance is a joy. Sherman's German
twist dancer is so funny it defies des-

cription (and he is also no mean piano,

player). Douglas Pona (last seen in
PLT’s Steambath) is equally fine as Juan
Rodriquez, Pepe's cousin. We can be
grateful that he isn't the Juan who
got away. As ”Blind Yoe Yackson,"
Pona offers a blues number with the
most risible lyrics this side of Dizzy
Gillespie. ‘Karen Volz and Judy Bier-
man turn in gem performances as
Consuela . and Maria Hernandez,
Pepe's daughters.

Mark Stephen Lamanna’s set is
perfectly suited to this evening of
Latin madness. Festooned with tacky
artificial flowers, phallic symbols, and
huge breasts thinly disguised as hills,
it is a veritable monument to poor
taste. I loved it.

One might wonder why the PLT,
which presented such gutsy and

of Seagulls who played well and
did an excellent rendition of
their single, ”I Ran.” However,
although they were well
received, they failed to generate
any of the enthusiasm that the
Go-Go's produced. The
audience wouldn't even start to
leave until the Go-Go's came
back for three encores. They
finished up with a rocked-up
version of the beautiful ”This
Old Feeling," which, like a good-
night kiss, only confirmed that
tonight's Go-Go's concert was a
date well worth keeping. L

Roxy's
Heavenly
Heartaches

AVALON
Roxy Music
EG (Warner Bros.)

This album shows that Roxy
Music is one of the consistently
excellent groups in contempor-
ary music. The 10 songs on
Avalon feature the unique voice
of Bryan Ferry, set like a
roughly cut jewel in the soo-
thingly rhythmic guitar work of
Phil Manzanera and accented by
the sparkling woodwind work
of Andrew Mackay.

Although most of the songs
deal with themes related to the
down side of love—boy doesn't
get girl, boy loses girI—or boy
would do anything to get girl,
the tremulous voice of Ferry
imparts a hopefulness to the
lyrics that few performers can

ROXY MUSIC

match. Lyrics such as "I was blind,
can't you see/ Through the long/lonely
night/Heaven knows I believe/ Won't
you take a chance with me," which
would be merely mediocre in
the hands of, say, the banal
Journey, are given a new fresh-
ness when pleaded by Ferry.
It's difficult to cite specific

songs as standouts since the
high quality extends though-
out, but personal favorites are
"The ‘Space Between,” dealing
with a deteriorating relation-
ship, "Take A Chance With
Me," touted on the cover as "the
hit song" (I try to avoid WDVE,

but I suppose anything’s possi-

ble.) and the title track, which is
more than vaguely reminiscent
of "Dance Away" from the

Wrabit
MCA

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, look
out! Wrabit is out to steal your
act.

Tracks, the group's second
album, has both soft, easy and
hard pounding traits. The heavy
metal and power-pop are much
expected from this group which
toured with Black Sabbath last
winter. The music is searing,
yet laced togetherwith melodic
ingenuity. Best of these cuts are
”Run For Cover,” "There Was A
Time” and ”Don't Lose That
Feeling.”

What is unexpected is the
sudden change in pace the band
makes on the middle track of

WRABIT

each side. ”I'll Never Run Away" '

and "Don't Stop Me Now” are
so firmly implanted in the Adult
Contemporary genre that they
would fit on KDKA’s play list.
Wrabit’s music is good, but
their schizophrenic pace
changes are too disturbing to let
you enjoy the album as a whole.

HEARTBEATS AND‘ TRIG-
GERS
Translator
Columbia

You've just quickened your
step because you are sure that
he is following you. You haven't
gotten a good look at him, but
you instinctively run from

shadows. Now you get this
overwhelming sense of being
alone, alone with your pursuer.
It's a strange intimacy that
overcomes your fear, and you
feel like submitting to your fate
when you find that you've both

stopped, and at that moment,

you've found a meaningful
friend.

Translator constructs these
settings by introducing strong,
rhythmic guitar melodies and
building upon them to create
tension that leads to release.
Their sound is comparable to
that of the Gang Of Four, but
they are different in that they
try to reach out and bridge the
distance between people, while
the Gang Of Four are less com-
passionate and tend to wallow
in their isolation.

In the first song, "Every—
where That I'm Not," singers
Steve Barton and Robert Dar-
lington face that age—old prob-
lem of a long-distance relation-
ship, and for most of the album,
they seem to be contemplating
it, brooding over it and finding
ways to overcome it. In "When I
Am With You," he states very
simply why he needs her, "Eve-
ryhody's screaming, everyone's divide-
d/Everyl7oaly's looking over their
shoulder/Everyone's searching for pro-
tection, everylzodys so afraid of want-
ing to be needed/ When lam with you, I
feel like smiling." "My Heart, Your
Heart" ends the album on a pen-
sive note, the singer sitting at
his window from daybreak to
dusk gazing at the people think-
ing, "It's my heart, it's your heart on
my mind/It's not money, not
revolution."

Translator should be heard by
people who think that New
Wave is pretentious and imper-
sonal. And paradoxically, since
Translator is less likely to shock,
they will probably have a diffi-
cult time being noticed, and
this would be an injustice to a
good album.

BAD TO THE BONE‘ _g
GEORGE THOROGOOD
EMI/AMERICA J

I doubt if anyone has ever
accused George Thorogood of
being too subtle. After all, this
man thought it_might be fun to
do a tour of all fifty states in
fifty days. So, Thorogood and
his band of Delaware Destroy-
ers piled five deep into a refur-
bished yellow cab one day and
did their thing for 50 consecu-
tive nights! '

That "thing," if you've never
seen or heard it, means some of
the hot, hot, hot hottest rock 'n
roll around. Thorogood and
Co.'s latest, Bad To The Bone, con-
tinues that tradition with
another helping of well-rooted,
blues—based, music.

Thorogood's sound blends
equal parts rhythm and blues in
the true sense of those forms,
not the pop-oriented and homo-
genized product that coupling
now represents. At the heart of
that sound lies his guitar and
the anthology of influences that
it embodies. Instances of those
influences include "No Particu-
lar Place To G0," which clearly
echoes Chuck Berry's "School's
In" and, reaching back even
further, "New Boogie Chillun"
on which Thorogood's hollow
body Gibson retains the hell-
born qualities of blues pioneer
Robert Johnson and his improv-
isational licks.

Other songs worth noting
include "Back To Wentzville",
"As The Years Go By" and
"Nobody But Me," an old
Human Beinz tune that, along
with songs like "Shout", "Louie,
Louie" and "Farmer John," made
up the genre known as "frater-
nity rock".

This is George Thorogood's
first album on the EMI/America
label, which will now distribute
his records. It is hoped that the
move to the "big time" will make
more folks aware of this cross-
bearer of the dying breed of
music known as the blues.

to face reality and come out of the Theatrical Closet.

\ Meet Us September 13!

What to do.

Join us. We are the Theatre Arts Department at the University of Pittsburgh. We; need actors, dancers, singers. musicians. stage
carpenters. stage managers. lighting crew, box office help—more theatre jobs than you can shake your Shakespeare at. And
don't worry if you think you've never set foot on a stage or struck a hammer blow in anger—or even it your parakeet doesn't think
you're funny. we're willing to teach it you're willing to learn.

The First Step.

It you are currently a Theatre major, thinking about it, or just want to do theatre work when you're not studying accounting, come
and talk to us. We'll be at the Stephen Foster Memorial Theatre (adjacent to the Cathedral of Learning) on Monday, September 13,
from 4 to 6 PM. Skilled or unskilled, interested in work on or off stage—we want to see you there. As a blatant bribe, we offer free
refreshments. we'll show you we"re not a clique of snotty artists. we need you—and if you're still reading this. you probably need
us. We’ll'tell you about allthe different and exciting ways you can get active in theatre. and give you some straight anwers 6B6llt . . 
our jobs and programs. »

The Second Step.

Audition. (Don't freeze— professional actors hate the word as much as you do.) Freshmen and Sophomores can get details at
the Monday meeting about a Fresh/Soph Revue to be presented as the first production in our studio Theatre. And everyone-
undergrads, grads, faculty and staff—is invited to come out for our opening mainstage production. Lygistrata by Aristophanes.

Lysistrata auditions are Monday and Tuesday, September 13 and 14. 7 to it PM, at the Stephen Foster Memorial Theatre. You'll
be asked to read from the script (familiarity helps) and to have a song prepared (preferably comic), with or without musical
accompaniment. All roles are open. " ’

If you're not ready to come out yet.

Come see our productions. You don't think we do all this work just for our egos. do you? (well,
actually we do, but it's no fun if you're not out there to applaud us.)

we offer generous student discounts on single tickets and subscriptions for our mainstage
productions, and our Studio Theatre shows are tree to all Pitt undergrads’ (compare that to the
price of a movies and a pizza). i

Let us entertain you. We're good at it.

its shape the way a creature takes its
shape. For example, no one was pro-
ducing Shakespeare Festival. No one
was doing theatre oriented towards
the workers. So we began our highly
successful documentary theatre pro-
gram, producing original works like
Steel City and Hearts and Diamonds.

"We do have a national reputa-
tion,” Favorini continues. ”Excerpts
from Steel City were featured on the
Today Show. Steel City was also invited
to the Smithsonian Institution's Fes-
tival of American Folk Life, where it
was very successful. And the Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival has been
featured in national publications,
such as The Shakespeare Quarterly and
the Wall Street Journal."

What impact does all this work
have on the average Pitt student?
"Almost none,” says Kathleen
George, a recently tenured professor
in the department and the director of
the Shakespeare Festival's smash hit,
Hamlet. "You don’t see many Pitt stu-
dents in the audiences at out produc-
tions. And though our auditions are
open to all Pitt students, faculty, and
staff, it's usually just the Depart-
ment members who show up.” When
I asked George why, she thought-
fully looked at her desk for a few
moments and replied, ”I don’t
know——beats me.”

The why is probably too complex a
question to deal with here. But it cer-

// .

tainly must be said that the Theatre
Arts Department offers rich resour-
ces to the university community-
resources which are largely
untapped.

Most obviously, there is the enter-
tainment resource. The University
Theatre Company and the City
Theatre Company offer generous
student discounts on single tickets or
subscriptions, and provide a wide
range of exciting, professional qual-
ity theatre. The mainstage season
this year includes, The Three Sisters,
while CTC will offer Working, How I
Got That Story, Ladyhouse Blues, and an

\

original work to be announced.

The biggest entertainment bar-
gain in Pittsburgh, however, is the
Studio Theatre. Last season its work
ranged from a musical (Wonderful
Town), to a mystery (Gaslight), to
drama (Sizwe Bansi is Dead, I Am A
Woman, The Death of Bessie Smith, and"
Cowboy Mouth, Part II), to comedy
(Table Settings). While this yea_r:s_sea-

David Bromberg is one of the
best and most unique solo per-
formers that can stand before
an audience with an acoustic
guitar, and on Sunday, Sept. 12,
PPC's Entertaining Diversions
and CMU’s AB Concerts will
bring him to Flagstaff Hill in
Schenley Park. In case you are
unfamiliar with his music, his
honors and accomplishments
will probably suffice to impress
you. In 1979, he won the Bay
Area Music Award for Best
Guitarist, and what makes this
so impressive is that those nom-
inated included the likes oflerry
Garcia, Carlos Santana, and
Craig Chaquico. Forvthis kind of
guitar virtuosity, he has been
termed the "m usician’s musi-
cian." What does that mean? It
means that, along with six or
seven solo albums, he has made

carpentry skills that are useful
around the house, and ‘there is little
difference between building a cos-
tume and making your own clothes.

And, of course, there are the per-
formance possiblities that exercise

versity and Studio Theatre auditions
are open to all members of the Uni-
versity community, and frequently
City Theatre Company auditions as
well.‘ Talent and a committment to
the work are more important than
experience; after all, a University is a
learning environment. The Studio
Theatre is producing a Freshman/So-
phomore musical revue, and
members or those classes are invited
to try out regardless of previous
show-biz experience. Lysistrata, to be
directed by Kathleen George for the
mainstage, has a huge cast, and the

side appearances on almost 100
albums, sitting in for everyone
from Bob Dylan to The Eagles
to Phoebe Snow.

Bromberg is immune to cate-
gorization, since he bridges the
gap between rock, folk, R&B
and bluegrass, and incorporates
them into his own distinct
blend. He dominates the stage
with a vibrant presence that
suggests humour and enthusi-
asm with every movement. His
voice and outrageous use of lan-
guage can be described as acro-
batic. He has a talent for finding
a groove in a song, and rambling
off strings of complicated words
sung so fast and with such detail
that he can leave your mouth
hanging open. His description
of the belly-dancer in ”Sharon"
is a good example: "She did some-
thing so phantasmagorieally incredu-
lous, so supernaturally incandescent, so
astronoinitally superfluous..." Many

all Pitt undergrads, grads, faculty,
and staff. George is looking for a
wide range of talents for her show;
her ideal cast member, she says,
would be _p"a reincarnation of the
1920's vaudeville comedian."
Finally, there are the academic
resources of the Theatre Arts
Department. Most courses are open
to non-majors. Education majors, for
example, frequently take Introduc-

V tion to Performance to satisfy one of

their departmental requirements.
Course offerings include acting on
all levels, directings, dramatic litera-
ture, voice and movement, and a var-
iety of technical theatre subjects
(stagecraft, lighting, design, etc.)
There are also courses in film and
theatre history.

of his songs are humorous, self-

mocking looks at boy—losing—girl

and subsequent sloppy drun-

kenness. Typical of this is his

poke at Firmin, his saxophonist,

"Look here, Firmin/God knows that

you're a mess/Folks, he says he don't_
drink any more, I know for sure he

won't drink no less."

Opening up the show will be
ex-Band-man Rick Danko, who
has had the most successful solo
career of the bunch, and it will
be clear why when you see how
much he enjoys playing his
music and how effectively he
captures his audience. It was
Danko’s voice that graced such
Band classics as ”Stage Fright,"
"This Wheel's On Fire ” and ’’It
Makes No Difference," and he
still performs them with equal
forceand dedication.

PETER FRAMPTON

THE ART OF CONTROL
Peter Frampton , ‘"
A&M .

-Here we find Peter Frampton
climbing from the depths of
rock-n-roll self-destruction and
trying to find his old perspec-
tive. The story is old hat...After
Frampton Comes Alive’, the ex-
Herd guitarist stepped off his
cloud and found he couldn't fly. ‘
Instead, he quickly plummeted
as he effortlessly churned out
three absolutely terrible follow-
up albums (I'm In You, Where I
Should Be and Breaking All the

' Rules) that dabbled in everything

from soft crooning to California
New Wave (Frampton? Blecchh).
The only result that came from
-these vinyl cow chips was the
realization that Peter Frampton
had burnt, out.

Ah, but wait, the phoenix is
rebuilding. Frampton has
returned, this time with ex-
Cretones leader Mark Golden-
berg and if anything, this album
shows promise. Sure, Frampton
Comes Alive is sickeningly over-
played but that was Frampton at _
his best. The Art of Control is a
return to those lines via a back
to basics approach (probably
due to Goldenberg). Most of the
album was recorded live in the
studios (.7) of Le Mobile. On the

album, Coldenberg and Framp-
ton share songwriting and gui-
tar duties with "I Read the
News,” "Sleepwalk," "Back to
Eden” and "Here Comes Caro- B
line" being the best tracks. Oh
yeah, Pete's guitar seems to .
have regained some of its edge
again.

So, for those who have Framp~
ton Comes Alive at the back of J
their record crates and are just
waiting for an excuse to bring it
back out—this should be it.

I like this band because:

a) No one knows how to pro-
nounce their name (personally, I
call ’em "hay-zee fawn-tay-
see" .

b) No one's ever heard of
them, except maybe two art stu-
dents who live in New‘ York's
Soho district and listen’ to
NYU’s radio station (that's how
I found out about them).

C) The A side is a song called
"John Wayne Is Big Leggy," and
if that's not funny, I don't know
what is. ' I

All I know about Haysi Fan-
taysi in concrete terms is that
they're a three piece band from,
yawn, Britain, and that their
two lead singers’ names are
Kate and Jeremiah. "John
Wayne Is Big Leggy” is a great,
upbeat piece which sounds
vaguely western, but the vocal
arrangement sounds a bit like
Annabella’s cooing on "Golly

Dire Straits

Vertigo

Change and upheaval has
suddenly become "a common-
place occurrence to the slowly
dwindling members of Dire
Straits. The group's release of
Making Movies saw the departure
of Dave Knopfler, rhythm guit-
arist and brother of the Strait’s
main vein, Mark Knopfler.
Now, on the eve of the band's
new release, drummer Pick
Withers has decided to turn in
his sticks, leaving only two orig-
inal members - behind: bassist
John Illsley and Knopfler.

With this rather shocking

news and the fact that the,

album's release has been
delayed, Dire Straits has finally

chosen to release a two-song.

single that evokes what may be
even more change in the band's
style and direction.

"Private Investigations" is as
quiet a song as it is searing.
Here, Knopfler chooses to ent-
wine his sultry, spoken/whis-
pered lyrics with some haunting
classical arpeggios that have a
Latin hue to them. At one point
in the song,_a heavy-fuzzed gui-
tar riff rips through these deli-
cate fingerings with the same
dishevelling effect that
Knopfler's lyrics manage to
depict a life torn apart.

The only problems with Coca—Cola ~

lie not in the areas of directing, act-
ing, or design, but with the writing
itself. A team effort by Ron House,
John Neville-Andrews, Alan Sher-
man, Diz White, and Sally Willis, it
occasionally wears a bit thin. This is
partially because some scenes are so
funny, they are impossible to follow,
and partially because the writers
sometimes permit, themselves to be
seduced by the obvious. Also, the
ladies are given short shrift by the
script. Female cast members Bierman
and Volz are the equals of their male
counterparts, but all the best bits of
schtick go to the men (shame on you,
Sally Willis).

Despite the minor problems with
the writing, I heartily recommend El
Grande ale Coca—Cola. Even one of the
best bits (and there are many) would
be worth the price of admission, and
you will even enjoy the frequent live
Coca—Cola commercials. Stuff your-
self with nachos, burritos, and tacos
before hand, and be prepared to laugh
a lot’.

Musical favorites from the turn of the century . . . .

"Badges, Posters, Stickers, T-

tans of Swing" was a rock 'n roll
song about a swing band,
"Badges..." is a swing song

about rock ’n roll bands and

their groupies who are groupies
for evidently materialistic rea-
sons. Although the Big Band
sound of this cut is a bit of a
turn—off, Knopfler's amusing
lyrics make this one worth-
while. Although the changes on
this single are evident, and the
rock 'n roll is a bit sparse, the
quality is nonetheless there, as
once more Dire Straits proves
that the Sultans still swing——if
only now to a different beat.

"Come On Eileen”
"Dubious"
Dexy’s Midnight Runners
Mercury/Phonogram (U.K.
import)

"Come On Eileen" was at the

No. 1 position last week on the .

British charts, but like a lot of
songs that find their way into
that enviable spot, it's no revela-
tion. Good beat, interesting lyr-
ics, nice music, butthe bottom
line is that no, it won't make you
jump up and scream "That's
incredible!" when you hear it.
On the other hand, God knows
worse songs have made it to No.
1 so maybe we should be thank-
ful for this.

Dexy’s Midnight Runners are
an established band overseas
whose roots are firm in R&B
tradition, making them some-
what of a rarity on the English
music scene where trend
abounds, even rules. "Come On
Eileen" is typical of their sound:
rhythm and blues that's dense
on instruments but sparse and
clean overall. "Dubious" is per-
haps more representative of the
group, for it's an instrumental
heavy on brass and horns, and,
while these guys know how to
play; it's pretty boring stuff.
But, this single is certainly bet-
ter than America's current
number one, "Hard To Say I'm
Sorry," and nothing to be
ashamed of.

For those who take pleasure in
low scoring football games, Three
Rivers Stadium was the place to be

‘last night.
3 . ._ In a massive defensive struggle,_

the top-ranked Pitt Panthers
derailed sixth-ranked North
Carolina 7-6.

A crowd of 54,449 sat through a
nationally televised game plagued
with penalties, incomplete passes,
interceptions, minus rushing
yardage and punts.

“It wasn’t pretty out there,” said
Pitt coach Foge Fazio. “The guys
were pressing too much——they

, were too fired up.

‘-‘The North Carolina defense
was outstanding,” Fazio told a

, .mass of media types in a post-game

“nopsis. “Danny was under a lot
of pressure all night.”

North Carolina scored the only
three points of the first‘half after a
roughing-the-kicker penalty gave
the Tar Heels a first down at the
Pitt 43-yard line.

North Carolina quarterback
Rod Elkins connected with tight
end Doug Sickels for l2 yards, then
threw to tailback Kelvin Bryantfor
five. .After Bryant carried up the
middle for four, Brooks Barwlck
booted a 39-yard field goal with 51
seconds remaining in the half.

The Panthers grabbed a 7-3 lead
t 6:26 of the third quarter_ on a
four-yard pass from Dan Marino to
Bryan Thomas. The drive began at

Ganzer Takes Two

By scorr DELLETT

-9- What looked like the weak link

in a national championshipfbid
turned out to be one of the strong
points last night. V

Punter Greg Ganzer, who, for
two years, sat on the Panther
sidelines waiting to get his chance
to prove what he could do, showed
54,449 people at Three Rivers
Stadium and a national television
audience that he, with his long,
high booming punts, contributed

to Pitt’s 7-6 win over North
Carolina.
Ganzer’s first punt gave an

indication of what would happen
during the game. His kick traveled
42 yards and was not returned, but
an illegal procedure call brought
the punt back. Ganzer then took
the snap and boomed one to the

_..same spot.

5* One might think that national
television and an important
opening game ‘might have sent a
cold sweat down Ganzer’s brow.
But Ganzer behaved like a cool,
confident veteran who could kick a
ball on a dime.

“I really didn’t feel any
pressure,” Ganzer said. A “I've
kicked on national television
before. It’s just a matter of
concentration.” ' ‘

Concentration—one of the most
important things to a punter,
along with consistency. For much

-“ml his collegiate career, Ganzer had

neither, and that kept him on the
bench‘. '

“When I was running second
and third string, I couldn't
concentrate as well,” Ganzer said.
“Sometimes I was punting as well
as I could.’’ i _

But in a game, the long-d1sta'ﬂ_C¢
punts never came. For examplegglﬂ.

Steps Forward  

1980, Ganzer got one chance to
punt. It went off the side of his foot
and landed 16 yards upfield. A seat
on the bench was reserved.

During the 1981 season, Ganzer
punted twice—once for 58 yards,
the other for 32. Back on the bench.

But a change occurred during
the Penn State game. Dave Hepler,
who handled the chores for most of
1981, tore knee ligaments after
stumbling to get a kick off. Second
string punter Tony Recchia came
in to replace Hepler, but a 32-yard
average is not‘a good one for a
Division I punter.

Ganzer enters_ the scene. After‘

winning the battle with Recchia
for the punting position, Ganzer
entered one of the biggest games of
his career and hit two punts for a
44.5 yard average.

Generally considered to have the I

strongest leg of the three Panther
punters, Ganzer had to go from a
three-step top a two-step style in
order to get the ball off more
rapidly.

“During camp, the coach
changed my style from three-step to
two,” Ganzer said. “I thought that
I was getting the ball off quickly
enough with three steps, but the
coaches said two step was better.

“Two years ago, they thought I
was too slow. It took a while to get
my timing down.”

When Ganzer did get his timing
right, the results began to show.
While head coach Foge Fazio
showed displeasure during the
early part of camp, Ganzer came on
towards the final scrimmage,

averaging 44.8 yards per punt. He

continued his progress when the
.’P’anthers_ reported back to campus,
and Fazio confidently announced
that he was going to be the starting

puntel; for the North Carolina

yard pass to Dwight Collins,
giving the Panthers a first down at
the Tar Heel 16-yard line.

Marino again found Collins over
the middle, setting up the

Greg Ganzer

game. .

During camp, Ganzer said he
kicked more footballs that he had
in the previous year, but a relaxing
week helped him out before last
night's game.

“We did more kicking than last
year," Ganzer said. “My leg was a
little more tired than ever before.”

He ‘added, “I had a pretty easy
week, and it benefited me.”

During the game, Ganzer moved
up from the customary 15 yards
behind center to 12. He said the
reason for this was to cut down the
angle of the rush.

touchdown pass to Thomas.

“We ‘had to scratch and bite to
get on the board.” Fazio
deadpanned. “Wedidn’t function
as a unit out there tonight. Eleven

’ guys didn’t come together.”

“I moved up closerito the line of
scrimmage in order. ‘to have the
outside guys go around,” Ganzer
said.

Ganzer credits his success last
night to his long snapper, Tony
Magnelli, and the offensive line.

“The snaps from Tony were
excellent," Ganzer I said. “The
blocking was really great.”

He added, “I also punted well.”

Ganzer now realizes the rough
times he faced the past two years
have benefited his kicking. ,

i“I was a little frustrated when I

Pitt’s Defense Ruffles TarHee|s’. Feathers  

What did gellwas the Panther
punting game, which- once was a
big question mark. Greg Ganzer
averaged 46-yards aipunt.

“I had to get the ball off quickly
because of the rush,” he said. “I
had to concentrate a lot; there was
no time to think about the
pressure.”

“The punting game really came

‘ together. Greg did a great job,”

said Fazio.

North Carolina moved within’
one point when Rob Rogers, the
T_ar Heels’ long distance kicker,
converted a 48-yard field goal

midway through the fourth
quarter.
After driving to the North

Carolina 31, the Panthers found
themselves in a fourth-and-one
situation. Fazio opted to go for the
first down, but when Pitt , was
penalized for illegal motion,
Marino took the snap from center
and kicked the ball downfield.

The Tar Heels took possession at
their 10-yard line and proceeded to
move backwards. While fading
back and looking for a receiver over
the middle, Elkins slipped and fell
to the turf at the goal line. The
referee ruled the play dead at the
one.

With time running out, Elkins
found a man open in Pitt territory,
but the defense was there to
smother him. The clock mercifully
ticked to an end for the offense-
oriented fans. For those who
cherish defense, another quarter
would have been\]ust fine.

was doing well in practice and still
sitting on the bench,” Ganzer said.
“I ‘learned that you have to perform

well in practice. You have to, try to»

treat practice as a game.”

While Fazio was displeased with
several parts of the Panthers’ play
against the Tar Heels, he has only
one remark about Ganzer’s
performance.

“He did a very nice job," Fazio
said. -.

These few words make all the
frustration and hard work‘ worth
while for Greg Ganzer.

occer Team Gains
Experience In Virginia  

By LISA GRENEVICKI

The Pitt soccer team had a diffi-
cult time in Virginia, losing 3-0 to
both George Mason and the Uni-
versity of Virginia this past
weekend.

Despite two opening losses, head
coach Leo Bemis believes the
Panthers gained experience and
learned more about the potential of
the team.

“We went in with our eyes
open,” Bemis said. “We knew what
we were getting into. The players
like to play strong teams. I believe
this experience strengthened the
team.”

In losing the season opener to
George Mason, the Panthers
played 80 minutes of scoreless
soccer before giving up the goals in
the last 10 minutes.

In that game, senior forward Eric
Tiedtke was hit from behind,

bruising the inside of his knee.

Tiedtke, last year’s top scorer, was .

unable to play against Virginia.

“The team played very timidly
against George Mason,” Bemis
said._ “We didn't quite have the
dash when we needed it.”

Both George Mason and Vir-
ginia are top caliber Division I
schools. Virginia, now ranked 15th
in the nation, went to the NCAA
playoffs last year.

Bemis had a very successful
recruiting year and it showed, as 10
new players made the trip.

Two freshmen played key»-roles
in the Panthers’ defense, stopper
Brian Casey and sweeper Mike
Russell. Both are from Virginia
and were familiar with their oppo-
nents’ high level of play.

“Casey and Russell were team-
mates down in Arlington,” Bemis
said. “Their unity showed and they
understood how those teams play
down there. They are two very

good ball players.’

As usual, the booters had fine
performances from seniors john
Hagenbuch and Tom Trempus,
junior Don Bowen and Freshman
Jim Steele.

The Pitt booters’ next game is
this Saturday, when they travel to

Grove City. The Panthers 

league foe Grove City 3-1 last year
and Bemis believes they are ready
for Pitt’s upcoming visit.

“It’s our first league game
against a fairly good club,” Bemis
said. “They’re returning most of
last year’s players.”

In order to chalk up a victory
against them, the Pitt booters must
find a scoring touch.

Junior transfer Matt Engle, com-
ing off an ankle injury, should be
ready. Bemis hopes Engle, who was
a scorer at West Virginia Wesleyan,
will ignite the Panther scoring.

“We have to have someone in
there who has the confidence to.
score some goals,” Bemis sai
“The team has to have a spark to
get the scoring started.”

In a fast ‘ paced arena of
lightning-fast ‘spikes and Mach 1
serves one would not imagine this
sport to be played by those of the
female persuasion. Don't bet your

the Cleveland State Classic and
meet Loyola for a 7:30 p.m.

It's a new season and as is gener-

tio marks. The team is coming off
a 3’8-l5year —one of the best marks
in team history. The record,
though, is of a deceiving nature.

And Pitt achieved the unique
distinction of becoming the first
team from the East to defeat a Cali-
fornia school. Pepperdine and Cal
State-Berkeley fell victim to the
Lady Panthers.

Once the first ball is served up
tonight a new picture will unfold
on Collier’s clean slate for the first
time in seven years. As has been the
case over the last several years, the
Lady Panthers have had one or/two
standouts to whom their team-
mates could consistently look for
production.

‘The two last year were Paula

of powerful spikers who were in

their senior year. And this year's
components?

“Nothing short of a balanced
team,” Collier said. “This season
we will stress offensive diversity
and expect big contributions from
everyone.”

up a force consisting of three

If there is a pilot to navigate this

Where are you, Ricky...

Earlier this week, it was reported
that former Duquesne center Ricky
Tunstall was going to the Univer-
sity of Georgia on a basketball
scholarship after having signed a
letter of intent to enroll at Youngs-
town State.

In a Past-Gazette report,
Youngstown State coach Mike
Rice, formerly with the Dukes, said
that Tunstall would enroll at the
university today.

According to Rice, Georgia
made a last-ditch effort to persuade
Tunstall to stay in Athens during
the Georgia-Clemson game, but he
said they just made a good try.

drug research and founder of the International
Federation for Internal Freedom, has long been
an advocate of nonconformity and uninhibited
behavior. His motto in the 1960’s was “turn on,
tune in, drop out.”
