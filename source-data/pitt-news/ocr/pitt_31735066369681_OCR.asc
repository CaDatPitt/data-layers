    Rubber-Stamping Pitt’s Budget

“I wish we wouldn’t have this same problem every

1 year.” _

This statement was made by William Rea, former
chairman of Pitt’s Board of Trustees, after the board
passed a $150 tuition increase last year. Rea was not
venting his frustration at the need for a fourth
straight tutions increase, but was instead chastising
“maverick” trustees who argued against the in-
crease. T

The “mavericks” last year were State Senator W.
Lewis Coppersmith and Alfred Lawson. In other
years, Judge Ruggero Aldisert had led the assault
against tuition increases. .

After four years of raising tuition, it came as a sur-

prise to no one when the trustees "made it five in a_ row V

Tuesday, again calling on students to share the bur-
den of inflation and low state funding.

much as $85 a term (depending on which stateibudget
Harrisburg passes) was approved with the same

showed a concrete objection by voting nay. Aldisert
and Coppersmith» were absent.

Coppersmith is busy in Harrisburg with the

‘Senate budget, hearing and Aldisert, absent for the

second straight year, may have just given up his fight

against tuition hikes.

There are two plans in Harrisburg for funding Pitt.

With a tuition increase hanging
over the heads (and the pocket-
books) of Pitt students, Student
Government Board ‘members ‘are
irate, disappointed, and frustrated
about a problem they can do little
to change.

SGB President Stan Galanski
said in an interview yesterday that

going here,” she said. “Some may
even be priced out of staying.”
According to some board mem-
bers, the blame for the tuition hike
lies between_the state legislature’
and the university administration.
“Whether the university or the
state legislature is to blame, you
tend to say let them both be
damned because there is no one
there. to stick up for ine (the
student),” Galanski, said.-
“Eventually, we’re going to lose

students ﬁnancially,

already wondering whether they -

will return to school in the fall.

“Itseems to me the increase
may serve to be the straw that
broke the camels back for students
already hard pressed to afford
attending Pitt,” Galanski said.

“I feel it will serve as a blow to
enrollment and personally, I know
people wondering whether they
should drop out,” he added.

Cindy DeMatteo, SGB president
pro tempore, agreed and said the
increase may result in students
leaving Pennsylvania for state
related or private schools in other
states.

“My little sister is starting to
think about colleges out of state.
because it is cheaper than coming

to Pitt and we only live 45 minutes
away,” said DeMatteo.

DeMatteo, who started attending
Pitt in 1974, said tuition and fees
were initially about $500 per term.

SGB member Rita Cordisco, who
said the increase is “uncalled for”
is concerned about how the average
student will make ends meet.

“Its going to make it a lot harder
for the average Pitt student to pay
tuition,” she said.

SGB member Kim Watterson
said the continuing increases may
have an adverse effect on recruit-
ment. ‘ ,

“If Pitt’s so worried about
recruitment, if tuition keeps going
up, people’ will be priced out of

to higher education at
institutions like this,” he added.
Cordisco places the blame more

on the university than the state.

legislature, although the latter
bears some responsibility, in her
opinion.

“I am ‘extremely upset at the
Administration,” she said.‘ “For
all our lobbying efforts, what did
we get? Was the effort worth-
while?

DeMatteo said the university had
little choice in raising tuition.

“I don’t think that the university
is at fault, although I have seen
some waste (where cuts could be
made),” she said.

The board is expected to further
address the issue of tuition hikes at
its public meeting Friday" at 4 p.m.

money Pitt will eventually receive.

Pitt administrators believe the House plan will
eventually be approved, and will most likely tack on
But. if the state
budget still is not approved by August, or if Thorn-

burgh’s 4.5 percent increase wins approval, the ad- . I

ditional raise (amounting to $85) will have to be
added. Oficials are uncertain, however, as to an
adequate plan for tacking on the extra increase. ,
“It’s an iffy kind of question,” said Jack
Freeman, vice chancellor for planning and budget.
Freeman is probably the man most responsible for
the “contingency” income budgets.
“We have envery reason to believe that the Senate
will go along with the House,” he said.
If the Senate doesn’t go along with the House?
“I don’t know how we’ll handle it,” Freeman said.
“We have to make a decision by July (the end of the
fiscal year). ” _
The senior at Pitt who enrolled in the fall of 1976

has now seen tuition skyrocket.over $600 in four

years. 1

Medical and dental students have had to stomach
astronomical increases. Medical students will pay
$8,200 in tuition next year'(up from $6,200) last year

while dental students will be forced to pay $7,200, an '

increase of $2,300 over last year.
What is happening here is an institution that is

pricing itself out of the educational market. -A

Someday it may become practical to attend state-
related schools in other states. The state-related
universities in Pennsylvania have the highest tuition
rates of all state-related schools in the country.

In the l930’s only the wealthy families could af-
ford Pitt. The industrialists who ruled Pittsburgh
also put Pitt on the map by pouring money into the
new Cathedral of Learning’.

In the 1950’s, and especially the 60’s, the com-
plexion of Pitt changed. -It became affordable -10

middle and lower class students and was a ticket ou "

of the coal mines and steel mills to a better life. Now

5 it is becoming impossible for the middle class family

to afford Pitt-

As long as the state determines the cost of
education and Pitt remains a “political hostage,” as '
Chancellor Wesley Posvar puts it, tuition will con-
tinue to rise. I

Instead of rubber-stamping all tuition increases,
trustees may do well to heed the advice of Lawson,
who claims Pitt might improve its chance at increased
state funding by refusing to‘raise tuition.

“I’m afraid unless we send the state a message that
we have our own house in order, we will be forced in-

. to closing our doors and having the state take us

over,” Lawson said Tuesday.
Point well taken.

Winnipeg General Manager Ferguson says ‘they Own Hull

MONTREAL AP—The National
'1-rockey League’s expansion raft
was enlivened Wednesday by the
latest chapter in the struggle
between the Chicago Black Hawks
and Winnipeg Jets over star left
wing Bobby Hull.

The Black Hawks had reclaimed
Hull from the Jets’ roster, hoping
to lure him out of retirement and
help improve the team’s faltering

-attendance at Chicago Stadium.

Hull played the first 15 seasons of

his glittering career with the Black
Hawks before leaving them in 1972
to become the first big name player
to sign with the World Hockey
Association.

Winnipeg General Manager
John Ferguson, insisting Hull is too
valuable to give up for free—in
spite of his retirement—made him
the Jets’ third selection in the
expansion draft.

“We own him and that’s it. If he
(Hull) wants to play hockey in

Chicago, they’ll just have to give us
something for him” said Ferguson.
Reportedly, the Winnipeg general
manager has demanded any of the
following players from Chicago in
exchange for Hull: defensemen
Greg Fox and Pat Ribbele, right
wings Blain Waigle and J.P.
Bordeleau.

“There's no question that
outside of right wing Peter Marsh,
Hull is the best layer available in
the draft,” said uson.

Black Hawks‘ general manager
Bob Pulford, referring to his trade

talks with Ferguson, said “The

players he was asking for were
some of the best players on our
It was ridiculous. We want
Bobby, but we realize and Bobby
realized that he’s 40 years old and
you can’t give up a 22-or 24-year-
old player to get him.”

Pulford said he will still continue
his attempts to make a deal but he
may have to hurry, since Ferguson

spoke of sending Hull to the New
York Rangers.

“He’d be the perfect guy to play
for the Rangers,” said Ferguson
who became general manager for
Winnipeg after a stint in a similar
position with New York.

“He could play with the Swedes

NBA Agrees to Adopt Three-Point Basket  

ASHINGTON AP—The National
Basketball Association general
managers and coaches voted
overwhelmingly Wednesday to
adopt the 3-point field goal next

season in an effort’ to create new‘

fan excitement and cut down on
physical play underneath the
basket.

Both groups expected the club
owners to approve the proposal at
their meeting next week.

The general mangers approved
the proposal by a vote of 15-7 while
the coaches voted 15-5 in favor of
the 3-point basket, one of the
mainstays of the old American
Basketball Association.

Both groups also‘ voted over-
whelmingly against a proposal to
legalize the zone defense, the other
major topic discussed during the
two-day annual meeting of the
NBA general managers, coaches,

team doctors, business managers
and public relations directors....

The general managers voted
down the zone defense 20-2; ‘the
coaches 19-1,

Jerry Colangelo of the Phoenix
Suns, chairman of the general
managers’ group, said the’GMS
were persuaded to vote for the
3-point plan because the “former
ABA people said it would add
excitement to the game. If you can
add excitement, then that is a
plus.”

‘However, Jack Ramsay of the .

Portland Trail Blazers, president of
the coaches association, said the
ABA coaches indicated the 3-point
basket “opened up the game, got
rid of the congestion in the basket
area. It not only rewards for the
long shot but forces the defensive
team to play the perimeter players
more honestly, thus opening up the
game.” ‘

The $125,000 tournament, at the
Queen’s Club, is one of the grass

Wimbledon.

Gerulaitis, the No. 2 seed in this
event and the winner recently of
the Italian Open, was humiliated.

Linda Siegel 6-0, Wednesday in the
rain-delayed first round of the

tournament.

Full of aggression after missing

Siegel, the U.S. Open junior
champion, to get into the match.

from an injury diagnosed as

ments and was expected to be
released from the hospital Thurs-
day. V

Guidry was in Fairview South-

Watson, Nicklaus Agree Comparisons are Unfair to Both

By The Associated Press

Many comparisons are being
made between Tom Watson,
currently golf’s outstanding per-
former, and Jack Nicklaus, the man
who dominated the game so long.

Watson, who at 29 is Nicklaus,’
junior by a decade. says such
comparions are difficult if not
impossible to make with any
degree of accuracy.

Nicklaus says it isn't even fair.

“It's almost like apples and
oranges at this stage,” Nicklaus
said before a practice round for the
79th United States Open Golf
Championship which begins Thurs-
day on the Inverness Club course.

“l’d won a couple of U.S.
Amateurs as well as the NCAA
national title before I turned pro
and then won the U.S. Open as my
first pro title.

“Tom had to do it differently.
He had to go through the PGA
Qualifying School. He had to learn
to qualify. Then he had to learn to
make the cut. Then he had to learn
to make a check. Then he had to
learn to win. .

‘ ‘‘He’s been out here for what?
Eight years? And he didn’t win for
the first two or three. So it's really
not quite fair to try to make a
comparison there."

The comparison is heavily

weighted in Nicklaus favor.
Watson at age 29, goes into the
American National Championship
with 15 PGA Tour titles to his
credit. His three major champion-
ships consist of two British Opens
and the 1977 Masters crown.

At age 29 Nicklaus went into the
1969 U.S. Open with 27 PGA Tour
titles. He had seven majors———two
U.S. Opens, three Masters one
PGA National Championship and
one British Open. In addition——and
not included in those figures-were
two Australian Open crowns and
three victories in the old World
Series of Golf.

‘‘I think if you asked Tom, he'd

tell you it's too soon to make any
comparisons,” Nicklaus said.
“There’s no question that he’s
been the outstanding player in the
game for the last 2% years. But I
think he’ll tell you his place in the
game depends on what he does in
the next few years, his record in the
majors over the next few years.
There seems to be no doubt that
he’ll make it, barring injury or
something like that. But it has to
be done.”

And that's exactly what Watson
said.

“You can compare players only

when their records are complete"
Watson said. “You can’t use
money as a yardstick. It changes so
much so often. You can only
compare them on such things as
scoring average, their records in
the majors, their records on the
great courses. And they can be
compared only on the long-haul.

“To be a great player you must
have a great record over a long
span of time, not just a few years.
You must have a scoring average
over a long period " of time.
You must win in the majors and yti‘.L’=
must win in the majors consis-
tently.”
