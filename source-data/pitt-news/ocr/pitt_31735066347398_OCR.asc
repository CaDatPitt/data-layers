Belonging on the Ballot

Rules traditionally are open to interpretation. The judicial system of
appeals inthis country is for the review of legal interpretations. Manya
plaintiff will appeal a case to a higher court in hopes the court will see a
rule in a different set of circumstances and reverse a previous decision.

In ‘other words, one shouldn’t interpret rules to mean exactly what
they say. There are hypothetical events that don’t exactly contradict the
reasons a rule was created, but they don’t follow the rule, either. The
system gets by because these hypothetical events usually don’t occur.

But one did at 4 p.m. last Friday afternoon. Prospective Student
Government Board candidates Michael Bates and Sally Shoup already

‘ had their petitions for ballot position turned in, but not their college -

transcripts. Their transcripts missed the four o’ clock deadline. But only
by 40 minutes. _ '

The Student Government Eections Committee ruled them ineligible
for ballot position Ivbnday because of those late transcripts.

The Student Government Elections Committee’s purpose is -to help
qualiﬁed candidates for Student Government Board reach the ballot.
But strict interpretation of deadlines, especially for a college transcript,
doesn’t follow this purpose and will not - guarantee placement of
qualiﬁed candidates or the ﬁltering out of  unqualiﬁed.

Remember, thiswas acollegetranscriptthat missedthe deadline, not

‘ the petition for placement. The Board candidates had to have 100

signatures by four o’clock. However, their transcripts contained the
same data at 3:30, 4:00 and 4:30. Transcripts, as long as candidates
have the required 2.0 average, are just not as important as completed
Both candidates were approximately 40 minutes late with their
transcripts. The SGEC'would not have lost anything by accepting them
that late. ltsjob is to put as many qualiﬁed candidates as it can onthe
ballot—-not to createas much red tape as possible’-for them.

Becausethe SGII.’ has nothingto lose, andthe other candidates have ~
nothingtolose andthe student bodyhas everythingto gainthroughthe
inclusion of two more candidates in the ﬁeld, the Student Government

I Judicial Board should overturn the SGEC decision when it meets tonight

and allow Bates and Shoup their place on the ballot.

Remembering King's PittTa|k ‘

BY CHUCK O’NElL

Ican never forget the visit that
Martin Luther King, Jr. made to
Pitt in 1964. The visit came right
after he had received the Nobel
Peace Prize. King was sponsored
by the Student Government Lec-
ture, Committee and spoke to an
overﬂowing capacity audience in
the Student Union Ballroom.

He was met at the airport by a
full entourage of chauffeured limou-
sines ﬁlled with community per-
sons and students, white and black.
In his address he spoke of the need
for moral commitment to the ‘Cause
of freedom. Many examples were
given of problems around the
country and the world in which
people should take a moral

‘ position.

While today, I can't remember
the speciﬁcs of his speech-I was
very young at the time——the effect
is still with me. Dr. Kinghad a way
of getting the complete attention of
an audience. I cannot remember
anyone who had been exposed to
him being unmoved by what the
man had to say. His logic was in

perfect order and he really knew’

how to show that peace made
better sense than war and that
racial integration was socially
superior to segregation.

Martin Luther King Jr. was the
ﬁrst person I had met who believed
and actively worked toward ideas
that many people believed to be
Utopian. He made dreams reality
and was a gladiator for peaceall
over the world.

The signiﬁcant thing about Dr ,
King’s method was that he did no I’
use abstract philosophy or way-out ,1»)
reasoning. Instead, he made it all .
very simple, very much insthe same
manner that Gandhi brought peace

to India. He gave the college
student a direction during the time
when the young sought image
identity. America at that time was
not morally bankrupt but merely
asleep, and he awakened us and
brought person-to-person relation-
ships to a new height. 1 1,

Black people have no monopoly‘
on Martin Luther King Jr., for he
was the champion of all ‘the
downtrodden and oppressed. ~
Happy birthday, Martin Luther,
King Jr.; the world will always hold
your memory dear. I

Nyden: Taking on Pitt Trustees

We are angry that the Posvar
administration is trying to ﬁre Dr.
Paul Nyden, a Sociology professor
who opposes racism on campus and
who actively supports the labor
movement. We believe this ﬁring
was politically motivated, for it is in
line with the administration’s policy
of trying to remove‘ Blacks, women,
pro-union and politically progres-
sive students, faculty. and staff.

But the Nyden case is a symptom
of a much larger crisis at Pitt. Over
100 students, professors, and staff
workers have race, sex, union, or
politicalcases pending against the
administration. Dr. Sharon John-
son, for example, is a biochemistry
professor who was ﬁred for being a
woman; she has had a four-year
court injunction. to keep her job
until her lawsuit is resolved.

The administration has harassed
black students and the Black Action
Society. It has made severe
cutbacks in vital programs like
Wome_n’s Studies and Black
Studies. We are especially upset
that Dean Rosenberg has just ﬁred
Prof." Yusef Ali, despite the fact that
the:Bla'c_k S_tudi_es.de_partment voted
unanimously to re-hire him. And
with the new.l5'-year retrenchment
plan, it appears that no one is

' S0l'S,

secure, not even professors with
tenure. .

Pitt may be the No. 1 anti-union
institution in Pittsburgh. It is the
city’s biggest employer, yet the
administration has systematically
opposed union organizing drives
among graduate students, profes-
secretaries, and ‘hospital
workers. While maintenance
workers do have a union, their
contract expires this month; if they
are forced to strike, as last time,
they certainly deserve campus

support. ~

Tuition hikes have made it harder

and harder for all students,
especially Black and working-class
students, to attend Pitt. The new
retrenchment plan may mean
another tuition hike this spring and
fewer admissions next fall. Yet if
the administration did not hire
high-priced lawyers to ﬁght campus
unions and discrimination suits
(they have spent over $1.5 million in
the Sharon Johnson case), they
could lower our tuition.

The upcoming Pitt Board v of
Trustees meeting is an opportunity

I for students, professors, and staff

workers to‘ present grievances
against the Posvar administration.
These meetings are public, as

provided for by the Pennsylvania ,1
‘ ‘Sunshine Law. ’ ’ Our delegation of
students, professors, steelworkers, 33“
coal miners and community leaders
will insist upon our right to speak.
Pitt is a public institution which
receives 62 percent of itsibudget
from taxpayers and is therefore
responsible to the public.

Finally, we ask you to join us in
demanding that the Board of
Trustees be elected and more.
representative. Of the 36 trustees,
the majority are the heads of big
corporations like U.S. Steel, ‘9
Consolidation Coal, Westinghouse,
Gulf Oil and Mellon Bank. There is
no worker, one student, only two,
Black people, a few women, and a '
handful of educators. Big Business

’ has a stranglehold on Pitt; corporate
executives, as trustees, carry their
racist, sexist, and anti-union
policies onto the campus. We

‘believe that a strong coalition of
campus and community organiza-
tions can begin to break this be
stranglehold, reverse discrimina-
tory practices, and make Pitt
address itself to the severe
problems facing the people of
western Pennsylvania. '

: Letter to the editor

Let's Throw the Bum Out

In the January 7 (Friday) issue of
the Pitt News, Cris Hall had an
excellent article about the source of
the problems with Pitt basketball.
That same night in the Pittsburgh

V Press, sportswriter Bob Smizik had

5‘:

an article about the same topic.
Here is a quote from both articles:
“My loyalty is to the program. If
our program needs a shot in the arm
from someone else....” This was
basketball coach Tim Grgurich’s
statement after the Panthers lost
their 9th game in 11 tries this
season, in this case a 100-91 loss to
the West Virginia Mountaineers.

SGB:
Time for

A Change?

As the Student Government
Board (SGB) elections approach
this month, it is time to review the
purpose and function of this
governing body.’ This year it seems

Qapparent that Student Govern-

it

ment, again, did not meet the
students’ needs. The Pitt News
has been deluged with grievances
concerned with the inadaquacy. of
the SGB. They arouse the anger of
the students when: they passed
remunerations, when at this time
there is no money available in the
emergency fund for student

groups; they arrogantly cut back
funds for student groups that they
deemed unworthy; they took the

P Uontrol of programming out of

students’ hands and into their own;
and they were unrepresentative of

women and black students. ‘SGB _

acted in the interests of the
administration, becoming an ad-

ministrative rather than a student‘
The demonstration of the '

voice.
Black’ Action Society had been

When one analyzes the talent on
the Panther squad along with their
dismal record, it is apparent that
something, somewhere is wrong.
Cris Hall, Bob Smizik, and
especially I have pinpointed the
problem. Grgurich is not cut out to
be a big-time basketball head
coach, especially when his team
faces opponents such as Cincinnati,
Maryland, Notre Dame, Syracuse,
and a host of other powerful teams.

First of all, there seems to be a
lack of fundamental teaching with
the Panthers. It is obvious that
there is a lack of picks and
designated plays.

Larry Harris, Sonny Lewis, Mike
Rice, Wayne Williams and all of the
players are good enough to play at
this level and they all have the talent
but all players need a coach to teach
them the strategies and fundamen-
tals of the game.

Another of Grgurich’s problems‘

is playing the wrong. men at the
wrong times. At crucial times
during the West Virginia game,
Harris, Rice, and David Washington
were all given rests when their
offensive efforts were needed. It
goes on and on. '

As for the offense, the Panthers
use a point-guard offense but with
the outside shooters they have in
Lewis and Scott Nedrow and the
driver ‘in David Washington (who
can play guard like Nate Archibald),
they should use a two-guard
offense. With the height and
outside shooting ability that Rice
and Ed Scheuermann have, either
one would begvery effective in a high

post. Larry Harris, Wayne
Williams, and either Rice or
Scheuermann are all capable of
being stellar forwards. This set-up
would be much more effective than
the present system.

The defense is the major
problem. The ‘Amoeba’ must go.
Rice and Scheuermann were both
quoted in the Pitt News as to having
trouble with the strange thing. The
Mountaineers were constantly open
for easy buckets and there were
excessive fouls in futile attempts to
stop these layups. The Panthers
can go man—to-man with anyone.
They can match-up with any team
on the basis of their height and
speed; The man-to-man defense is
the most effective in basketball and
according to the great former coach
of the Boston Celtics, Red
Auerbach, is intimidating since the
defenders play the man, not the
ball. .

Tim Grgurich is a good recruiter
but should be no higher than an
assistant coach. With the talent
that Pitt has, they should be able to
defeat teams of the likes of
Youngstown State and Ohio Univer-
sity but it could be tough while
Grgurich is still around. He has
indicated that his job may be in
jeopardy and why not‘? If this school
wants big-time NCAA basketball,
they are going to have to bring in a

good coach like a certain Number ‘

One in the country football team and

department was smart enough to do A

Pitt's Hoop ‘Fans’ Blasted from Bluff

The game of basketball is very
unique in that the fans can play a
direct role in the players’ perfor-
mance. It is a personal game, where

every encouraging word of support

from the crowd can boost the morale
of the team. With an improved
attitude, and knowing that its fans
back them all the way (win or lose),
the team then has reason to put out
a 100% effort to win a game. With
no support, the team sees its efforts
as wasteful and thus develops a
“lack of attitude.”

This “lack of attitude” has been
very evident with Pitt basketball

and its supposed fans during the
.past two years.

Even though the
team does not match the position of
prominence and power that the
1960’s UCLA Bruins and the
1955-1971 Duquesne Dukes had,
Pitt still hasthe ability to reach the
top.

But, in order to do so, one
essential element is necessary: that
of fan spirit/ support. ‘

This lack of fan support was
especially evident at the ’76
Pittsburgh Classic, and even more
so during the Duquesne-Pitt game
in particular.

An article in the Pitt News stated
that in the past, Pitt supporters
have bought only 300 tickets to the
event, while Duquesne fans get
over 1,000. Well, at the event this
year, people supposedly there to
support Pitt outnumbered Du-
quesne people by over 2-1. The only
way you could tell if the Pitt people
were alive, though, was when they
managed to cheer for a basket that
was finally made by a Pitt player.
And, it was not that often either.

- Pitt basketball fans definitely
demonstrated that night that they
were of the poorest quality, and that
explains the overall situation. They
showed a strong apathy, and just sat
there—doing nothing but twiddling
their thumbs or eyeing up both
side’s cheerleaders.

It was obvious that the Pitt

players were affected, since they
couldn’t‘ mount any strong and
sustained attack anytime during the
game. How can ateam be expected
to have any chance of winning when
its “fans” have no faith in it? In
order for a team to be ﬁred-up, it
must be supported every minute of
the game, and the fans must stay
until the final buzzer, win or lose.
Pitts fans utterly disgraced their
team when they left early during the
Southern Illinois game, showing
that they just didn’t give a damn
about anything but getting to their
cars. .
Duquesne basketball fans, on the
other hand, support their team
totally, and all the way. Pitt fans
didn’t know how to cheer, so they
left that job to their cheerleaders.
Duquesne fans, though outnum-
bered by over 2-1, were constantly
cheering, prodding their team on to
always do better. Duquesne fans

were complimented in 1973 by fans —

at the University of Maryland,
where the Dukes were beat bad that

year. I was part of the contingent
that was praised for being one of the
most vocal yet behaved visiting fans
that had ventured to Maryland in
years. That is a sign of
respectability which was earned.

In conclusion, I believe that it
would be a better game for Pitt and
whoever it plays if the Pitt fans
dropped their disgraceful, apathetic
attitude and became involved.

The game would then become
interesting for both sides. Just
think of what it would be like if Pitt
and Duquesne had a real rivalry

going, where both players and fans
actively participated in the game. _

Duquesne basketball supporters
have constantly showed their spirit,
in a most lively manner. True fans
and spirit are those qualities vital to
a team’s success. And that’s what
Pitt needs desperately——active
spirit behind dedicated fans...but
which it has been lacking for years.

true that students don't care about
and don't participate in the Student
Government elections. People
don't take ﬁve minutes to cast their
votes. because the election will ’
have no affect on their lives as Pitt‘
students. How can the Student
Government be representing StLl"g‘V
dents when: they are not a’
representative body of the student
population, there is no communi-
cation with students, and SGB
consists of only seven people?
Students can attend SGB meetings,
but they will not necessarily be put
on the agenda or allowed to speak
and are never permitted a vote.

If students are to be represented,
the structure of our governing bod at V
must be changed. A majority ofth
students must be involved in the
process, if it is to work for them.
There are other options to Student
Government as we know it, such as
a governing body of all students or
student unionization. In a
forthcoming issue these possibili-
ties will be explored.

Oakland is alive this winter
once more with the start of the tray
season. Record snows have
attracted people from all over the
country, and some slope owners are
predicting this will be the best
season yet.

Traying you say? You mean the
latest craze of the jet-set crowd?
The one safe way for Ford to enjoy
the snow? You bet. Oakland is
nothing less than a world centre
rivaling Vale Colorado and even
Seven Springs, and it’s all here for
your enjoyment.

To get the most out of your tray
vacation, here’s a beginner's guide
to the sport, the scene and the
lifestyle:

The important element of traying
is style. Actual skill comes second
or third. For instance, your gym
teachermay snigger, but if you tray
in a well-thought out wardrobe
you’ll be the giant of the slopes.

The cardinal rule in dress is
layering. Layers of anything.
Army-Navy store mark-downs are
big this season, as are matching
boots of any make, combined with
old heavy gloves and three or four
scarves, (avoid the stripes, they are
passe this year) as well as those big
knobby tossle caps with the yellow
ball on the top emblazoned with
Panthers or Steelers.

Don’t forget your shades. I
Aviators will pass, but wrap-
arounds with a bit of tape on the
stems will put you up there with the

-best. If you have hair, show it.

wardrobe, , the next step. is to get
your equipment. first, of course,
are the two arms God gave you.’
They should be perfectly aligned so
that when they hang at your sides
they just brush your knees. If they
do not (you can perform this simple
test in a washroom stall) get to the
Health Service quick, you are in
danger of a slow, painful death.
Even with many enlightened
doctors insisting this disorder is an
ailment, not a social deviancy, you
face "loss of citizenship and
imprisonment.

If you are normal (remember,
arms knee-length or longer) the
next choice facing the beginner is

selection of a tray. This is the point
where most people lose their heads.

‘ The result..snide snickers on the

slopes. Don’t get caughttwith your
unpolished naivete showing: make
a good choice now, and here’s how:

Although there is an on-going
debate in pro circles over the merits
of the Goodyear inner-tube versus
the Key Management plastique
tray, the beginner looking for social
points (and a cozy apres tray!) will
stick with the Key Management
equipment.

The Key Management gear is
easily available at cafeterias all over
the Oakland resort area and
provides a safe, stylish ride even for
the unenlightened, with the durabi-
lity to last the beginner well through
those ﬁrst falls into professional
skin-whipping and hot-shot acts.

With a hard-pack slope, the Key
Management equipment provides
all the speed a beginner can stand,
and, literally greased with bacon
fat, hamburger fat, chicken fat, or
any other sort of fat served in
cafeterias, the Key 1000 Tray does
well in powder too!

Professional squabbles aside,
most agree the normal derriere
should take up about ﬁve square
inches in the center of the tray. To
test, return to that good old
washroom and see if you can back
your buttocks into a tossle cap.
Again, doctors agree that most
normal, undeviant types can
perform this trick easily, so you
have nothing to fear, and learning
about your body is what ‘graying is

is all about.! If youcan’t.do it, it should
shed light on why people’ point at
i you and laugh out loud.

One’1,word of.~;4caut'ion;:‘j there 3 are

isnobsaround ‘who insist on using
imports (such as Duquesne, AAA?

Holy Ghostor the Chath am Breeze).
These are not, repeat, NOT for
beginners, and are usually of

if shoddy design. Stick with domestic

equipment, and help get this
country back on its feet!

Les Slopes

So, you’re decked out and ready
for action. Where to, you ask?
Well, glad rag, not for you the petty,
the cheap or the bourgeois!
Oakland is equipped with two of the
ﬁnest slopes in the world: The
Flagstaff Slopes and the Cathedral
Slopes, the latter within sight of the

famed miniature remains of the

Heinz Chapel in a Bottle, once the

largest religious structure ever’ put

in a tiny bottle!

I fear, though.

plenty steep and mighty wild, but a
beginner may do well to start on the
Cathedral Slopes. These are far

better, safety-wise.

A word to the wise: tray on
packed snow. Pack it yourself if
neccesary. Cathedral Slopes are
always well packed, Flagstaff less
so, at least, early in the season.

Standing at the summit of your
chosen slope, with all eyes rivetted
to your chic attire, you are now
ready for that first exhilirating leap,
the same leap taken by so many
existentialists before you; Don’t
Nietzsche ,was a
shrimp and look at all the fun he
had!

LeTechnique

The technique of traying was
developed at the turn of the century
by inexperienced Alpine climbers,
who, upon slipping their ropes
would plummet- down the face of a
glacier at thirty two feet per second,
terminating on the roof of a chalet, a

climbing partner below or an 

Hapke spent the past summer at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
Pasadena, Calif. where he assisted
the Viking landing team. His ﬁeld
of work is photometery, which is
the study of how light reflects off
objects. Hapke’s duty was to work
with the landing team to secure a
landing site for the unmanned
vehicles.

“We had a billion-dollar space-
craft,” Hapke remembers, “so we
wanted a safe place to land. 1t_ took
a long time——about three weeks-
before we found a smooth, safe
spot.” , ”

The two Vikings landed on
opposite sides of Mars on July 20
and September 3, respectively. ,

“Basically, _both sites were
thought to be smooth,” \Hapke
said, “but that was found from the
Orbiter photography and earth
radio scans. We were surprised at
the amounts of rocks and bolders
around the landing elipse.” V

The first Viking landed on the
floor of the Chryse basin, while’the
second touched down on the Utopia
Plains. '

Once aground, both Vikings
returned photographs, atmospheric
data and soil analyses back to
earth.

The material near the lander

sites was similar to the earth’s,

Arizona desert. The reddish color
of the regolith is caused by the iron

occasional young religious novice 

singing in a meadow.

it wasn’t very popular, but the
advent of the American University
changed all that. With cafeterias

came trays and with trays came ;

traying, and the entire tray culture

History aside, the ‘technique
involves hurtling yourself down the
slope, tucking t_he tray under your
bottomiebefore you hit the hardipack,
and sliding ‘as fastﬂanid as far as
possible. If you like your nose, you

avoid other trayers. If you like the
way you can bend and stretch at

parked cars, blocks of cement or
other ﬁxed objects.

Le Tricks pour In Hot Cliein

Naturally these basic skills soon
pail, and you'll be searching for new
thrills, new adventures and new
scars to show your friends.

The most popular is the
Choc-Choo Train, invented by a
Chinese revolutionary close to Mao
who was banished to a rather cold
and snowy region of Manchuria for
real ‘or imagined crimes. Simply
link up in a chain with your friends

oxide in the soil. The rocks were
found to be of volcanic origin and
were weathered by ‘strong Martian
sand blasts. Y

But the prime reason for Viking’s
launch was its search for life on
Mars. Both vehicles beamed
discouraging results back to earth.

“We found that life can't exist
on Mars as it stands now,” Hapke
“The chances are one-one

Antarctica. ' ’

The basic building-block of life,
liquid water, does not exist on
Mars. And the "Martian at-
mosphere is primarily carbon
dioxide.

Yet Hapke feels the lander team
did its best to ﬁnd life. “We
purposely aimed the two Vikings
toward the northern latitudes of the
planet to look for life. But we
struck out. We all felt the low
temperature would keep organisms
in a frozen state." ‘

Ironically, Hapke felt the sim-
plest biological tool was omitted
from Viking. “All we really needed
was a microscope; that’s it. But, I
guess it was too obvious and
scientists passed it by,” he said.

Despite negative reports on life
forms, Hapke felt a great deal of
knowledge was gained from the
mission. “By understanding the

weather patterns on Mars, for I

example, we can learn more about
the earth's fragile atmosphere.”

» Also the practical beneﬁts such
as a better understanding of
earthquakes, can be used for
geological studies.

After the success of the Vikings,
Hapke felt the future is more
exciting than ever. ‘ "I feel we could
effectively have a spacecraft
around every planet in the solar
system in the near future. We
could really learn a lot on the
properties of these planets.”

“The way space exploration is

going,” Hapke said, “I wouldn't

miss, for anything, what is going “to
happen in the years to’ come.”

Like, hello again. It sure is cold here in Pittsburgh. Like, I think the‘?
last _time I ran into weather this cold was when I was giving a
metaphysical lecture for the crown prince of Siberia in the middle of the
frozen tundra. (They had to ship me back to America in a giant
ice.-cube tray-—four cubes for my feet', and two more for my nose and

tail).

Anyway man, I know exactly what question  on your frostbitten

mind. “Should I plow through snow and Arctic winds just to attend my
classes? After all, my nose and ﬁngers might drop off from walking
around in sub-sub-zero weather. Then where would I be?” I
Well, I can dig where you're at. But this is really a moral issue.
Deciding whether to skip a class, and ignore your obligations to yourself,
your professor, and’ your fellow students is a tough, soul-searching

decision .

Like, here is how I would settle the question. First, ask yourself
‘ ‘Man-—do I want to freeze my butt off out there?’ ’ If the answer is no,

grab a pair of dice and let them roll.

An even number means you skip class and stay at home. An odd roll of '
the dice means you bundle up and go to class today. But skip it A

tomorrow. You dig?

One more thing. Like, the next time you have to go out into the cold,
don’t feel so sorry for yourself. I mean, I have to go out there just to go to

bad skin on the end and ﬂick him
into nearby trees!

Another trick, but for the initiate
only (experienced trayers have
more sense) is Traying by Feel.
Simply blind your eyes with a scarf
and have a few trusted companions
ﬂing you down the slopes. First,
make sure of your surroundings, for
instance, Bigelow Boulevard may
be a good ride, but it’s not worth it
in the long run.

Professionals of course have
entire repetoires of tricks, fancy and
plain, with which to dazzle and
provoke their peers on the slopes.
The essence of all tricks, from‘
standing on your head, to standing
on someone else’s head, is to bring
off a. dangerous stunt with as few
internal injuries as possible.

With your beginner’s experience
buttressed by a few easy, tricks, you
are well on your way to becoming
the darling of the slopes and the
season!

Apres Tray
After a few turns on the slopes,

it’s time to pay serious attention to ,

the offerings of the Oakland resort
area. Pick your bar, there are plenty
to offer, but choose wisely‘ and with
some working knowledge of the ~
clientele. Republicans might bloom
in the ambience of MacDonald’s,

but for the Social Democrat there’s 7

no replacing the,Black Angus for an
evening of warmth, conviviality,
naked boasting and of course,
finding someone to tuck you in.
Oakland nights are cold nights, and
never forget it. '

As a side note for those who
chronically overindulge, most Oak-
land establishments have the latest
in indoor plumbing. Know your
washrooms! For the adventurer
seasoned with caution, Oakland
includes one of the foremost health

I centers in any emerging nation.

Get to see the sights. Mingle with
the native population of tenured
professors, research scientists and
upper level administrators. Widen
your cultural horizons! There is no
need to be stand-ofﬁsh. After all,
they are just like us. A ﬁfty room
mansion with swimming pool is
really not that different from your
slovenly little hovel. People are the
same no matter what their income.

Don't forget the camera!
Oakland offers the home-slide bug
plenty of variety and those amusing
little anecdotes of a well-spent
season will stand you well in the
unemployment line.

Les NextYear

Naturally, after expending all this
time and effort, and with such a
wonderful experience behind you,
you’ll want to be back next year, and
for the rest of your life ‘too!

Well don’t hold back. Each year
the Oakland season becomes more
and more crowded, and its getting
to the point where any damn boor
can read a newspaper article and
take off for the slopes, dressed like
some kind of basket case and
endangering the right kind of
people with crazy _ stunts and
singing long, loud drunken epics

In short, plan now. Register early
with either of Oakland’s lodges:
Pitt or CMU. The longer you put it
off the harder it will be. Pitt once
took just about anybody, but word’s
out that some veteran members of
the tray crowd are pushing for
higher standards and that means
fewer people. ‘

Right now, to get a spot for the
season you’ll have to register for fall
too, but don’t let that stop you! The
lodge offers a number of amusing
spectacles, top-ﬂight entertainers
and self-improvement courses on
two-dimensional solids and Latin

Once you've registered, you can
rest safely knowing your place has
been reserved for the next exciting,

suburban home for $137,000 says
he considers Ford “the most

David Bowie, now thirty, has passed through glitter, disco, and soul,

to achieve ﬁnally thehigh-powered sound of his last album, Station To

Station.

BY JIM FARERI

Last Saturday was David Bowie’s
birthday. The mutable rock pioneer
begins his thirties with a lifetime of
accomplishment already logged to
his twenties.

I like to think of Bowie as the
product of sixties consciousness
gone decadent. Bowie has seen the
hopes of the -sixties dashed in the
seventies, but unlike any other
contemporary musician he inter-
prets his resulting pessimism via
futuristic revaltions of destruction.

 Symphony ls Moving

In Previn’s Direction

BY PAMELA EUSI

The Pittsburgh Symphony 0r- «
chestra has been transﬁgured
under the direction of Andre Previn.
Whether this transition has been for
the better or the worse only time,
the public and the director himself
will be able to tell.

‘The change was evident in the
symphony
weekend at Heinz Hall, although
more so in the three tone poems of
the first half of the program than
during the cello concerto of the
second half. »

If one listens to the series of
recordings Previn has made with
the London Symphony Orchestra,
efﬁcient precision and organization
immediately is noticed. One senses
an aloofness, too, a standoffish
mysticism that haunts the soul.

Yet ‘through it all the competence
of Previn and your intuition tell you
that he knows exactly where he’s
going with the music, and how far.
Also, you’ll know when he’s
reached his limits. He won’t go
beyond anything he, or whomever is
under his baton at the time, can’t
do. A trust emanates from this

continental director. This is what
has transformed the Pittsburgh
Symphony.

L’Apprenti sorcier [The Sorcer-
er’s Apprentice] by Paul Dukas put
one in the mood to see the movie
Fantasia. Just the title conjurs up

~ notions of Mickey Mouse in his
 pointy wizard cap cowering beneath
 the wake ofthe thundering horde of \
 uncontrollable brooms.‘.}.: T v‘
i The original material for the
 music comes by way-__of a Goethe
 poem by Lucian, a Greek satirist ’
’ who wrote a collection of tales called
“The Lie Fancier.” Composer
’ 1 Dukas employs dramatic instru-
mentation for this poem. g

Previn’s interpretation enter-
tained all the mysticism and relish
of a child playing with a new toy.
The plodding rhythm sounded by
the bassoons led to a_ world of
magic whose characteristics are
explored by every orchestral
instrument. Even the point in
which the horde becomes over-
whelming ‘to the apprentice be-
comes so explosive that the

Debussy patterned his Prelude a

Afternoon of a Faun] after a poem of
Stephane Mallarme. A faun is a
creature of Roman mythology-that is
half man and half animal and lives a
life of fantasy in some random
Roman forest.

The reveries of this strange beast

Stravinsky based an opera on a fairy
tale by Hans Christian Andersen
and transcribed a symphonic poem
from that. The tale is the Song of
the Nightingale and involves a nice
story about a nightingale that gets
its big chance to sing for the
emperor of China and is upstaged
by a mechanical dummy.

Stravinsky borrows material from
all three acts of his opera for the
symphonic poem and in doing so
transcribes elements of Chinese
music such as the pentatonic scale.
These elements color the piece and
provide interesting contrasts be-
tween marches and lyrical lines.

Some outstanding ﬂute and violin
solos, as well as oriental rhythms
and the use of the celesta, made this

Dvorak’s Concerto in B minor for

His rhythms, string crossings and

No doubt many of Bowie’s most
ardent admirers were won over in
his new wave of popularity, by what
some old fans call with‘ scorn the
commercialized “ Disco Bowie. ’ ’

V But most Bowieites spring from the

days of Ziggy Stardust, when Bowie
was just breaking in the states and
exploiting the bisexuality that he

has become famous for.

The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy
Stardust And The Spiders From
Mars is the biggest album of
Bowie’s career; his preceding LPs
were all extraordinary, but Ziggy
and the accompanying tour was
what seized the imagination in the
seventies as Dylan, Jefferson
Airplane and The Dead did in the
sixties. L _

-With the Ziggy concept, Bowie
introduced not only a tight, sensual,
not-known-before rock ‘n’ roll
sound, but also a complete
philosophy of life. Ziggy, who was
the urbane, asexual Bowie himself
(always photographed wearing
multi-color glitter while artfully

Bowie Thirty, Still Changing

portraying his character onstage),
,was something solid for the
alienated seventies teenager to

emulate.
After the Ziggy album and tour"

Bowie recorded Aladdin Sane,
another concept album, this time
based on his vision of afuture
America. Bowie was worn from
touring and this dreadfully over-
produced LP reﬂects it. However,
the characteristic Bowie genius
comes through and we are again
hypnotized by images of a
decadent, stagnant America, level-
ed by unexpected nuclear war.
Bowie’s most valuable and
astounding attribute is the ability to
change his image and artistic
direction without losing currency as
«an entertainer. Pin-ups, an album of
Bowie’s favorite sixties songs, was
unexpected by the segment of fans
weened on Ziggy, but for the
well-versed Bowieite it was no
surprise. This constant metamor-
phosis is not just something Bowie

  ’7 6: Not Vintage For Films

/

BY M. C. PILECKI

About this time of year, movie
movie critics all over the country
T take to their typewriters—through
choice or assignment—to select‘ the
best ﬁlms of the previous year.
Usually, this takes the form of. a
Top Ten or Top Twenty, as though
the ﬁlms of a given year win a
footrace or are charted like the
latest disco hits. It’s not all that
difficult to say one or more
particular movies are good (a
reasonable, amount of intelligence
and taste can do that), but to say
that one __film is better than another,
.11? t be tan another

   
  
  
  
 
  
   
       
   
   
   
   
 
  
 

 

  

and so on, is ludicrous. How can
one really compare excellent movies
with entirely different subjects,
approaches, etc?

Another problem of choosing the
“best” of a given year is that of
memory. Certainly the Christmas
releases stand out, and perhaps an

' All the-President’-‘s Men and The
Omen exist in the bunch. They
were ~big. _.enough‘ movies (in

us not forget them so easily. But

what of those ﬁlms that squeaked

through during the winter or the
“ summer dry season? It takes a lot
.more than memory.

If one were to choose from all the I

ﬁlms playing in local theatres last
year, one is sorely tempted to make
up a list solely from the ﬁlm
festivals at the Guild and South
Hills Theatres, not to mention the
Pittsburgh Filmmakers and Car-
negie Museum. None of the new
ﬁlms can really stand up to the best
of the past.

Anyway, here are one critic's
views of the most outstanding films

to open ﬁrst-run in Pittsburgh in_

1976. In alphabetical order, the
cream of the crop were All the
President’s Men, The Family Plot,

~ Marathon ~Mair, *Network~ and (The

Omen. All had solid scripts, good
acting and cohesive direction, and
all are ﬁlms this critic wouldn't
mind seeing (or already has seen)
more than once. L

Marathon Man and The Omen
stand out as truly scary movies——
although both did tend toeXCeSS-
both with a dreamlike quality and a
fine understanding of the medium.
Family Plot and Network, the two
comedies (although neither of the
straight ho-ho sort), show totally
different sides of humor. The latter
is an outrageous, sometimes angry
satire, while the former is a touch of
English black comedy mixed with
American slapstick and suspense.
All the President’s Men, of ‘course,
is a historical ﬁlm about the greatest
scandal ever uncovered in the
White House. It’s also responsible
for making a lotof kids think that
they, too, can be supermen for great
metropolitan newspapers.

Now for another list of outstand-
ing films (and nobody’s saying
these are inferior ﬁlms to the

Bruce Dem, Barbara Harris,
Dustin Hoffman, and Robert
Redford starred in three outstand-
ing films of A 1976: Family Plot,
Marathon’ Man, and All The
President's Men.

in
alphabetical order, Carrie, Hester
Street, Obsession, Seven Beauties,
The SevenPer-Cent Solution, silent

ious group): again

Movie, Small Change, Special ,
Section, The Story of Adele H., and
Taxi Driver. Obviously, these
aren’t the big-budget numbers of
the ﬁrst group, but still deserve‘
mention for being better than the
crowd. v
Carrie, an exploitative satire on
teen-age life, was a highly
manipulative comedy that has
turned the stomachs of many, and
thrilled many more./
"~+;Hester Street was’ a‘ poignant,‘

    

true-to-life tale of turn-of-the-
century immigrants to New York
City. The only black-and-white ﬁlm
of the year, it was starkly beautiful
in a way Technicolor can never hope
to match.

Obsession, the second Brian
DePalma ﬁlm (with Carrie) on the

list, is unlike his usual work. It’s a.

blatantly commercial attempt to get
back into the good graces of the
powers that be, but it remains

enjoyable as a romantic suspense

tale.

Seven Beauties, the most recent
of all the many Lina’ Wertmuller
ﬂicks to play town, is also the best
the controversial Italian director has
to offer. It’s a bizarre comedy of
life, uproaringly funny and
grotesque.

The Seven-Per-Cent Solution is a
beautiful, lush ﬁlm on the world’s
greatest detective, focusing on him
as a human being instead of as a
paragon. Silent Movie, the only
really funny “straight” comedy of

 

  

exploited. Still, the scenes with

Burt Reynolds and Anne Bancroft

make it worth seeing twice.

Small Change, one of two (with
Adele H.) Francoise Truffaut
movies, is his most gentle and
human ever. It’s a real story about
real kids, neither sweetened up not
exploitative; a “little” ﬁlm, but fun
to watch. Special Section, another
French entry, is a heavily political’
ﬁlm investigating guilt in the story

" of at special section of the French

court during the German occupation
of the World War II. Collaboration
or survival is a key question of the
ﬁlm.

The Story of Adele H. is one of
those rarities—~ a ﬁlm about a
woman. Inspired by the actual
tragic end of Adele Hugo (daughter
of Victor Hugo), the movie deals
with romantic ideals and the trials of

fame. Taxi Driver, a gritty
American ‘tale, also deals with those
ideas, but in an even more perverse
way.

Now for the corollary: the worst
ﬁlms of 1976. There are usually
more candidates for this dubious
honor, but let’s eliminate the ﬂicks
you know are losers just from the
titles and cheap publicity. Of those
major budget ﬂicks with‘the big
publicity campaigns, the most
outstanding fizzlers were (in
alphabetical order): Barry Lyndon,
Bluebird, The Man Who Fell to
Earth, A Matter of Time and The
Missouri Breaks.

Without a doubt these were the‘
biggest disappointments; boredom
almost without interruption. Barry
Lyndon, though a strikingly beauti-
ful ﬁlm, fell far short of the
expectations of the art. Pretty
pictures do not a ﬁlm make.
Bluebird was stuffed. Or should
have been. The Man Who Fell To
Earth really did fall—-such 2. boring,
pretensious piece of mishmosh. A
Matter of Time—well,you get the
idea the film’s a loser when the
director takes a full-page ad in
Variety disclaiming his association
with the ﬁlm, and sues to have his
name removed from the credits.
And then there’s The Missouri
Breaks, a pompous Western epic
single-handedly destroyed by the
disjointed, illogical performance of
Marlon Braﬁdo. _ ‘

Barring the movies already
mentioned,_ it was mostly a year for
mediocre ﬁlms suffering from a lack
of originality. There’s a list for this

category as well, namely Films That‘
_ Weren't Really That Good, And

Were Bombs At The Box Office, But
They Still Managed To Be
Entertaining. Sort of. Why not? A
list — of the most outstandingly
mediocre ﬁlms of 1976, speciﬁcally

and Cathouse Thursday, Inserts
and The Ritz.

There were many outstanding
achievements to be noted in 1976,
from actors, directors, set design-
ers, music directors, etc. Usually
the parts seem superior to the

-whole. All in all, 1976 was not such‘

a great year for ﬂicks. There were
several major-budget remakes,
even more sequels to previously
successful -ﬁlms, and hollow biopics
of several Hollywood idols. There
was more and more blood and guts,

less and less of qualiﬁed women in ’

good parts. One can only hope for
the future at this point.

(Continued from Page10)
does to gain success, in fact, change
is quite dangerous in those terms.
Bowie feels a need to keep
transforming, he’s impatient, bores
easily, and hates stagnation.

So after recording Diamond
Dogs, a last apocalyptic scrap
thrown to the Ziggy crowd, Bowie
abandoned glitter rock, a genre he
practically created, and headed for
the virgin soil of soul and R & B.

In the middle of the Diamond
Dogs tour Bowie changed his act
totally around and sung all his old
songs in the new way, as a soul
singer. Most of Bowie’s fans
couldn’t take such a fast transition.
When I ﬁrst heard the new Bowie on
David Live, I was ready to
pronounce David dead.

  Bowie: From Glitter to Soul

The number of people who were
sincerely hurt by Bowie’s quick-
change, testifying to the gap that
Ziggy ﬁlled in peoples’ lives, is
almost as uncanny as the number of
old-school fans who decided to keep
Bowie in their mythology. An
interest in Bowie, no matter where
you pick up his career, often entails
making a life hobby out of him.

Perhaps this is because there is
some element of greatness in Bowie
that shines through, no matter what
style he is currently assuming. It is
fairly obvious that Bowie believes
himself to be a superman, the
“Homo-superior” «of his lyrics
whose superior air with interview-
ers seems to stem from a legitimate
claim to being better than everyone
else. And after his performance

over the last ten years, I-c_ede—it’s a
proven claim.

Hardly anyone has, especially in

«this decade that is almost" sterile

creatively, managed to make an LP
that is an event, like a concert or
film, rather than just a “record.”
Bowie has: for each of his albums
he acts, assumes a character such as
Ziggy, and appeals to all the senses
as well as to speciﬁc needs that
people have. ‘His current interest in
acting (The Man Who Fell to Earth),
and even more so in directing, bear
witness to the presence in him of a

motivation, and consequent ability, .

to communicate with his audience
as totally as possible. This is
probably the most precious artistic
gift.

Wifim Grgurich Out?
“Never”--Grgurich

BY CRIS HALL

 

Pitt basketball coach Tim Grgurich’s recent remark that began with
‘‘If this program needs a shot in the arm” and ended with “...” had
everyone ﬁlling the dots with rumors of Grgurich quitting either at
season’s end, tomorrow, or three weeks ago. Well, you can forget it.
They’ll have to ﬁre Tim Grgurich if they want to tear him from Pitt
basketball.

“I’ll never quit a program, Grgurich said yesterday. “And
especially not this one. I’ve put in too much time. We’ve come too far.

“This program was a zero, and now we’ve built it into something
that’s good. I believe too strongly in too many things around here to
quit.”

With time to think (and read)
about it, Grgurich doesn’t agree
that Pitt’s program needs anything

7!

“I was just upset about losing,” he
said, explaining the week-old
remark. “This program doesn’t
need a shot in the arm from
anybody. It just has to grow.

‘ ‘They're going to be a great team
someday,” Grgurich said of his
talented, youthful and 2-10 team.
“It just may take more time than I
realized. I’m impatient and I
wanted those good things to happen
right away. It’s been hard, but I’m a
young coach and I’ll mature with
this team. We have to grow
together——and stick together.’ ’

“If we were winning, our food
would taste better and our clothes
would look nicer,” said guard Pete
Strickland, a sophomore. . “But
we’re not. I wish I knew why,but I
don't. There have been all kinds of
theories, but now it’s just a matter
of doing something. There comes a
point were you have tostop talking
and a lain— dw’ a
poinitnztvf. y g an e re “hat six-game losing streak.

“We really haven’t been playing, ” he added. ‘We do at time, but we
sure didn’t at Goerge Washington.” '

Sonny Lewis, on whose skinny legs much of Pitt’s basketball future
rests, concurred.

“We just aren’t playing together——we’re not playing team ball. We 1

do in spurts, but when we don't, we get our butts kicked.”

One thing of which the Panthers desperately are in need is a team
leader. Lewis has run one of the strongesticampaigns, but isn't looking
for the job. ‘ ‘I’d like to be team leader, but I’m not ready, ’ ’ he said. “I’d
rather be a team player. 1

“If I have to take that responsibility, I will,” he added.
rather see one of the older guys take it.”

Lewis, who played with Kelvin Smith and Wayne Williams on a
state—champion Schenley High team, has not enjoyed this season’s
early, uneasy going. “It’srough, man-—real rough. I've learned a lot,
but that’s beside the point. 9 I'd rather be learning and winning than
learning and losing.” P I

Reﬂecting again, Strickland came up with a solution to the current

“But I'd

Panthér woes. “What we need here is a disease,” he said. A disease? ~

“Yeah, the good-playing plague.”
And Tonight...

...at eight, Pitt will take on the Cleveland State Vikings in what
Grgurich calls ‘ ‘a very important game that will effect the makeup of our
team.”

According to Strickland, the Panthers will blow out the Vikings.
“Yeah.. .certainly.. .well, I sure hope so. We could use a win. The way
we beat them will be important.”

This will be Pitt’s easiest game in a long while, though Cleveland
State defeated a “brew ﬂu” plagued Pitt team, 60-56, last year. Also,
the Vikings sport a 6-10 center, Dave Kyle, who collected 24 rebounds
against Ohio University this season and averages close to 20 points per
game.

The Vikings went 6-19 last season—-the Pitt win was their
biggest—and are off to a 3-6 opening this year. Kyle is joined in the
starting ﬁve by seniors Charles Loving (6-6) and Larry Croom (6-5) and
freshman guards Ron Harris (5-10)_ and Andre Battle (6-4). This year,
having to contend with the entire Panther team--they faced only half the
squad last time——Cleveland State likely will ﬁnd itself outclassed by the
major-college Panthers, even if they are 2-10. 6 » . ~

Lycoming After Pitt

No one even knows where Lycoming
is located.

“I know they beat Princeton not
too long ago this season,” assistant
wrestling coach George Bryant said
helpfully. But that piece of
information seemed to be the extent
of the information on the darkhorse
Lycoming squad.

So it seems that Lycoming lives
the life of a shadow—always
glancing, evasive, impossible to
grab hold of. Pitt fans hope the
performance of the undefeated
Panthers (4-0) will-be the same.

“I think we’ll do well against
Lycoming,” Bryant stated. “our
weight problem is pretty much
under control now.” .

The weight problem referred to
was the one Pitt experienced going
into last weekend’s match in New
York against Eastern Wrestling
League rival Buffalo Bulls, a
surprisingly tough match that
resulted in a 20-19 Panther

' come-from behind victory, thanks to

the heroics of heavyweight Mark
Stepanovich. Stepanovich con-
quered the Bulls’ Joe Eirillo in a
12-1 super-decision, thus turning a_
19-16 deﬁcit into a — still-perfect
season.

“It was along, two-week vacation
for Christmas,” Bryant explained,
“plus, we are young—o-ur wrestlers
aren’t used to the Christmas break.
I don't think we wrestled our best
mate .”

‘ ‘Not to take anything away from
Buffalo,” he continued. “They
played a very smart match. They
were smart enough to keep the
matches they thought they’d lose
close.” '

During Christmas vacation, the

Pitt wound up on the short end of

It was close-closer than one’s
own shadow. Pitt did win, but
something bad may have come out
of the results-—Rande Stottlemyer,
All-American at 134 pounds who
wrestled against the Bulls, will
probably not wrestle against
mysterious Lycoming.

“No, Rande won’t be wrestling
Saturday,” Bryant conﬁrmed.
“Jim Gordon will probably replace
him, although we’re still holding
eliminations for the 126, 134 and
150 classes.” -

It will be the same starting lineup
that hunted Buffalo, including
freshman sensation Ed Brednaik
(158 pounds), who has yet to lose a
contest in college competition, Bill
Bailey, who is also unbeaten at the
190-pound slot; and Skip Bolin
(167), who came off the bench with a
fever to win and help set up
Stepanovich’s dramatics, against
the befuddled Bulls.

But can the Panthers overshadow
Lycoming, whoever or whatever
Lycoming may be? The home-mat

advantage will certainly be a factor 6

in Pitt’s favor. Why, just look at the
recent Buffalo battle.

“Buffalo kept the matches
close,”p Bryant reminded. “It’s
hard to beat Buffalo in Buffalo.”

And _it’s hard to beat Pitt in
Pittsburgh. But Lycoming is a total
question mark, so much so that it
will be a relief to see Lycoming leave
after the bout is over.

So if the Panthers win Saturday,
not even the dimmed lights in the
empty Field House after the bout
will extinguish the shadows of Pitt’s
smile.

Tracksters Open Doors To ‘‘In’’ Season

BY DAVE MCDONALD

The Pitt track team opens its
indoor season at 1 p.m. Saturday at
the Field House with a triangular
meet against Slippery Rock and
West Virginia.

‘This year’s team promises to
jump. throw and run higher,
longer, farther and faster than Pitt
has done in past years. The 1977
track team is compiled from quite a

, mixture of talent from 18-year-old

freshmen to Vietnam vets and
football players, along with a larger

group of underclassmen with a

handful of seniors to give depth to

' the:40-member team.
The Panthers are shaping up to

look like the talented teams of the
early '70s. with an abundance of
good quarter-milers and 880-yard
runners (which makes for good
one-and two-mile relays).

Starting off the ﬁeld of sub—50-
second quartermilers is sophomore
Kevin Carpenter, who has also run
a 6.3 in the 50-yard high hurdles.
Carpenter's senior counterpart.
Dan Schuerle, has run a 6.2 in the
highs and has also broken the
50-second barrier for the quarter-
mile.

The freshman crop of sprinters
includes Bud Cooper (from-. Beaver
High School), Larry Shippen (Lower
Merion) and Wayne Hursen (South
Hills Catholic).

Rounding out the sprinters is

Tankers Turn Tide: On
Buoyless Bisons, 73-40

BY JIM GEFSKY°

Although last Saturday’s swim

meet was held at Trees -Pool,”

Bucknell probably felt as if it were

facing a tidal wave. In a sense they.

were correct. as Pitt defeated the
Bisons 73-40. The rout couldihave
been worse. if the Panthers had not
chosen to run exhibitions in the
S00-yard freestyle and in the
400-yard freestyle relay. Neverthe-
less, Pitt still produced eleven
ﬁrsts and ﬁve‘ seconds.
Individual winners included

-freshman Dale Pﬂaumer in the

1000-yard freestyle, Dave Givis in
both the 100-and 200-yard free-
styles, Steve Leach in the 50-yard
freestlye, Bill Wagner in the 200-
yard individual medley, Bill Moser

in the 200 yardifly, Neal Wallace in ’
’ the 200-yardbackstroke, and Mark

Schuman in the 200-yard breast-
stroke.

The tankers also scored big in
the diving, taking first and second
in both the l-meter and 3-meter
dives. .Tom Fatyol and Dave
Reeder ﬁnished one-two in the
1-meter, while Scott Winkler and
Jeff Shaffer did the same in the
3-meter. _

Diving coach Al Coffey was

somewhat surprised at Bucknell's

, poor showing, especially in the

diving.

“I'm a bit surprised at how
overrated their divers are, especial-‘
ly their freshmen,” he said. “I was
rather pleased ‘with our perform-
ance, especially with Winkler who
is showing great promise. and

Fatyol who is ready to compete \
with the top level national divers,

But overall we're having some
problems with consistency, and a
mechanical problem on the 3-meter
board which stillhasnot been ﬁxed
could set our schedule behind
severely. But when these problems
are taken into consideration, I’m
pleased with our progress."

Pitt's record‘is now 2-0, but this
Friday head coach Dick Bradshaw‘
takes the tankers into-Columbus for
a match against Ohio State,
possibly ‘the toughest opponent
they will] face this year. The
following day the teams return to
Trees Pool for a match against

Penn State. / While the Nittany~

Lions do not pose the same threat
as do the Buckeyes, it will
nevertheless be no easy match.
The tankers are therefore planning
extensive workouts this week in
preparation.

This weekend they will definitely
have to sink or swim._

sophomore Keith Leckenby. who
has run the quarter-mile in‘ 48
seconds and grad student Willie
Walker, who has also turned in a
low 48.0 and holds Pitt’s 50-yard
dash record with a 5.3 clocking.

The half-miler staffis composed
of local Pittsburgh talent that
includes freshman Dan Dattilo
from Upper St. Clair, with a time of
1255.0 for the 880-yard run, and
Roger Winstanley from Gateway,
who holds a l:5S.2 to his credit. A
new face with the squad is
ever-improving senior Tom Fitz-

gerald. a 25-year-old Air Force’

veteran who has been showing a lot
of progress since his Central

Catholic High School days. Junior ’

  Princeton Crowns Pitt

BY JOHN FINN

Failing to register [its second
consecutive upset win over Prince-
ton, the Pantherette swimming
team fell two points short, 66-64,
in a meet Saturday at the Tigers’
home pool.

This was Pitt’s first meet since_it
captured its own invitational in

early December, and was the
Pantherettaes’ first dual meet of the I
- season. '

Princeton was hungry for revenge
after Pitt upset the Tigers last year
by one point.

The Pantherettes performed
admirably under the circumstances.
In addition to having a ﬁne nucleus
of returning swimmers, Princeton
realized an outstanding recruiting
year. ' But the biggest blow to Pitt
occurred at the beginning of the
season when ~All-American Angie
Lopez decided ' to retire from
swimming after competing for

Puerto Rico_ in the 1976 Summer
Olympics.

Pitt began and ended the meet on
a losing note. The Pantherettes
ﬁnished second in the 200-yard
medley and the 400-yard freestyle
relays. ‘ A

All-American Kathy Stetler turn-
ed in another outstanding perfor-
mance, placing first in the 50-and
200-yard freestyles. But she was
upset in what is probably her
strongest event, the 100-yard
freestyle.

Nila. DeJesus, another one of
Pitt’s ﬁne recruits from Puerto Rico,
won the‘50- and 200-yard butterfly
events.

Other exceptional 1 individual
performances were turned in by
Sandy Moran, Sue Guyer, Dianne
Kluglein and Debbie Schloder.
Moran, a freshman from North Hills

‘High School, won the 500-yard

freestyle and added a third in the
200-yard freestyle. Guyer, a
freshman from Roaring Springs,
captured the 200-yard breastroke.

Kluglein placed first in the 50-yard

I backstroke and third in the 100-yard
And Schloder, a _

freestyle.
freshman from Mercersburg Aca-
demy, ﬁnished first in the 50-yard
breastroke. _

Jamie Conley landed a pair of
second-place finishes. She ﬁnished
second in 200-yard butterﬂy and the
200-yard individual medley. She
also took a third in the 200-yard
breastroke.

Jennifer Price ﬁnished third
behind Conley in the 200-yard
individual medley. She added
another third in the 50-yard
butterﬂy and second in the 500-yard
freestyle.

Jenny Brooker and Linda Hamner
ﬁnished one-two in the one-meter
diving competition. Connie Heister
placed third in three-meter diving.

The young Pantherette squad,
with eight freshmen and seven
sophomores, looks to get back on
the winning track this Saturday at
noon, when they will face Wright
State College at Trees Hall.

Gymnasts Open Vault

BY MARK MURPHY

The 1977 gymnastics season
opens at Pitt Friday night when the
men’s and women’s team do battle
with West Virginia. This will be the
only dual meet of the season
featuring both squads and the
action at Trees Hall will begin at 7
p.m.

The men, who will complete their
short home schedule by hosting
Navy Saturday night, are led by
coach lg Perez, who looks for a big
improvement over last year’s
one-victory season.

“We were decimated by injuries
last year,” Perez said, “but we
gained some of those people back.
This sport gets only two-and-one-

V half scholarships every four years,

but we had the highest-scoring
team in Pitt’s history last year and
also the two highest-scoring
individuals ever.”

Those two men, seniors Bob
Pasterick and Don Stephenson, are
the top-ranked Panthers in the
all-around competition. To take
part in the all-around, one competes
in all six of the events-—the ﬂoor

1 exercise, side horse, rings, parallel

bars, vaulting and horizontal bar.
Although Perez’s two top people
are.set, the next few positions are
less certain. The third rated‘
all-arounder, Gus Papantonio, is
out for the year and will-be replaced

A by sophomore Doug Smith. The

ﬁnal all-arounder will be Frank
Klein, ﬁlling in for another hobbled

teammate, Ken Lunz.

Other Panthers to watch for are
Mike Petrosky, a top contender in
the side horse event, and Jim Colzar
on the parallel bars.

“If you can do the rings well it
does not mean you can do parallel
bars well or the vault well," Perez
claimed. “That is what makes
gymnastics so difficult.”

While men’s leader Perez has
injuries to worry about, women’s
coach Donna DeMarino is troubled
by inexperience, not to mention a

murderous schedule.

“We hav-e four returnees and
nine freshmen on the team,”
DeMarino said. “It will be difﬁcult
with nine freshmen, but everyone is
pretty healthy so that helps us.”

Last year the women went 6-5,
but this season they will take part in
only seven meets. Of their seven
opponents, three are national
powers.

“We face Clarion and they are
the number-one team in the
country,” DeMarino said. “We
also play Temple and Penn State,
and they are in the top ten.”

Sophomore. Clare Henry, last
year’s Most Valuable Player, leads
the team in the all-around
competition (vaulting, uneven bars,
balance beam and floor exercises).
However, on Friday she will take
part only in the uneven bars
competition due to a stress fracture
in her leg.

Other women to watch for include
freshman Regina Carson on the
balance beam, Alison Hoburg on

the uneven bars and floor exercise.
and junior Syndee Severyn who.
according to DeMarino, is in for her
best year.

‘ ‘ ‘Syndee was our high scorer last
year and this year should be even
better,” ’ DeMarino explained.
“We rely on her not only for her
scoring but also for her maturity,
since she is one of the oldest girls on
the team.”

The women’s next home meet
will not be until late next month,
February 26, when they play host to
Lock Haven.

Pitt Planning To
Bring Back ‘70’s

(Continued from Page14)

Also ﬁghting back after an injury
during cross-country season is Bob
Lee, a sophomore from Central
Catholic. Lee is ready to do battle
with the three-mile in quest of
dipping into the thirteen-minute
category.

Junior Mike McLaughlin from
Norwin. sophomore Bill Garver of
Central and freshman sensation
and City League two-mile champ
Wilbur Barnes from Westinghouse
are all prepared to hit the two-mile
circuit. '

Topping off the disciplined
three-and six—milers is a much
improved freshman from Hickory,

with Penn State-McKeesport, but
he aggravated the injury at a recent
practice and will be forced to sit out
the game. V
Guarding the Pitt goal now will be
left up to defensemen Rick Stein
and his “little” brother, Bob, who
will be returning to the lineup after
suffering torn ligaments in his ankle
early in the season. They will be
backed by veteran Bob Arturo and

Larry Gallick, while Billy Day, who I
has been with the team off and on, y

will again sign on at the ﬁfth
defensive post.

Freshman goalie Marty Bradley
will be an adequate replacement in
the nets, having won all three
games in which he has appeared
this season. After blanking
Cleveland State, 11-0, at the Civic
Arena in November, Bradley
topped Rockland College last
month, then played the majority of
the Pitt victory over the Rockland
Saints after the injury to Newell last
month.

“I think Marty is an excellent
goaltender,” Barcalow said. “He
showed his stuff up in New York and
he had that shutout down here
against Cleveland State. We’re all
very pleased with Marty.”

Barcalow believes the team will
offset the absences of Stump and

Newell by playing together and
listening to what it is told by the
coaches. Barcalow, along with
assistant coaches Bob Montgomery
and Bob Klemz, has been using a
system similar to that of Pittsburgh
Penguins General Manager Baz
Bastien and Coach Ken Schinkel,

watching intently and telling the

players their faults. The only
difference, Barcalow says, is that
the Penguins sometimes don’t
listen to the criticism from Bastien
and Schinkel.

“You’ve got to show them what
you want them to do,” Barcalow
maintains. “You can’t just tell
them and skate away and expect
them to do it. It just boils down that
if you don’t listen, you’re not going
to go too well. Our guys are
listening, but the Penguins are not
listening.”

That may be the main ingredient

in the Panther’s S-1-1 start, yet»

Barcalow also sees a definite
change in attitude on the team.

‘‘I thought we would jump out
after we made changes after the
Penn State game,” he said. “We
learned to play as a team and we

ironed out a lot of things. We got ‘

guys who want to win. They’re
really hockey players and they, have
a lot of spirit. y
