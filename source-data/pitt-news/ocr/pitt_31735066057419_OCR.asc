PISO introduces more cultures to students

By Stephanie Wright
F or The Pitt News

For the Pittsburgh International
Student Organization. a welcoming
reception is not just an annual proce-
dure.

“l love it here. I feel I'm at home."
said Saad Alkazemi. president of PISO.

American students as well as students
from all over the world said they ﬁnd
PISO to be the perfect environment for
learning and socializing.

Reactivated eight years ago. PISO
welcomes anyone who has an interest in
izitemationai cultures.

“Our main goal is to just mix people
together." said Joan Lucas. advisor of
PISO.

“You can meet anyone from the world.
places I‘ve never known about." said
senior Enrique Bazan from Mexico.

Members of the organization come
from familiar places like Japan. Mexico
and India. But others are from places
like Seychelles. a small group of islands
off the east coast of Africa near Somalia.

Coming to a new country can create
some problems like culture shock and
some international students may have
problems reiating to the .-\merica:‘.
Eifestyie. M80 is an opportunity: to get to

know American students more personal-
ly.

“Culture shock is when all the things
that you take for granted as the normal
way of doing things suddenly change."
said Lucas. “You're in a period of
adjustment until you know the new ways
and decide how you're going to handle
things."

The organization can be very helpful
during this adjustment period. Maysonet
explained.

“PlSO allows for students to find peo-
ple of their own home and culture." said
.\ta_\sonet.

Bankrupt

-From page I
require drastic cuts in a
country‘s budget. administra-
tion and education.
Sometimes the cuts can be as
high as 50 percent. and the
IMF determines how the
money is to be spent.

Countries go bankrupt
because most of their gross
national product is used to
pay the interest of the loan.

Brutus suggested reading
"Bank Check." a magazine
that analyzes the role of the
World Bank.

‘'It may be the most impor-
tant magazine in the world to
understand the global econo-
my." said Brutus.

“Five students from the
University of Pittsburgh will
be attending a meeting at
Harvard." Brutus said. “I
have evidence that this meet-

ing will in some way involve
Africans on this campus in
supporting a project which
will put them in the arms of
the IMF and the World
Bank.“ He added that he
believed Pitt will be paying
for this trip.

"If you wish to collaborate
with exploitation and oppres-
sion so that a few blacks get
rich and other blacks get
poor. it‘s your right." said
Brutus. “What you should
not do is make that choice in
ignorance."

"If South Africa is going in
the wrong direction. let us
have the guts to say so." said
Brutus.

He added. "The acceptance
of a New World Order ran on
market principles will be the
death of socialism and the
triumph of capitalism."

 will go to the gover-
nors office. Out of 10 pro-
posed. usually two or three
pass." Wion said. "Even after
the govemor passes it. to get
the funds it must pass through
the state legislature."

Included on the list of
requests were $25 million for
the "phase I construction of a
new basic sciences complex."

According to Wion. that pro-
ject is the long-temi future. but
the current proposal has resi-
dence facilities being built
where Engineering Hall and
Thaw Hall are located now
The new science complex
would then be built on an
undetermined property.

In addition to that request.
there is a call for S10 million
for phase ll of the renovation at
Trees Hall. and a call for $14
million for renovation at
Benedum Hall.

According to Wion. the
requests for these funds can
take a long time to become
reality.

“Every year. around the end
of September. every university
receiving money from
Harrisburg can submit 10 pro-
posals for state funds," Wion
said. “There is a backlog for
about 10 years," he added.

Wion opened the meeting by
calling the committee to elect
it's pro-tempore members.

“Generally, pro-tempore
members are people who have
attended the meetings and
showed an interest in budget
policy," Vfion said

Tom Anderson, Herb
Chesler. Sean Hughes,
Maureen McClure and Dave
Pratt were elected to serve as
pro-tempore members.

Also discussed at the meet-
ing:

-Wion said he contacted the
chancellor's office about
implementing the salary
implantation policy.

-Wion said the chancellor's
office has begun to evaluate
administrators, but a report hm
not been issued yet.

-Wion reported that the propos-
al on the capital budget was
approved by the University
Planning Budgeting
Committee.

Opinions
Small step on population

The United Nations population conference ended last week
with a general consensus on a new strategy for stabilizing the
world's population which goes beyond traditional family plan-
ning and attempts to give women more control over their lives.

The gains achieved by the population conference represent a

signiﬁcant step forward: however that step is merely one of
many which need to be taken. The final declaration. endorsed
without reservation by about 130 of the 150 conference partici-
pants. is non-binding and does not take precedence over nation-
al laws or religious beliefs.
The goal of the conference was to stabilize world population at
7.27 billion by 2015. What is being ignored by the conference
participants and those reporting on the conference. such as The
New York Tinies, is that this is likely an impossibility without
measures far more stringent than those endorsed by the confer-
ence.

For the world’s nations to rest on their laurels and think they
have really accomplished something significant would be a
travesty. Yet there are signs this is happening. In the wake of the
conference there has been far more discussion on who won and
lost than analysis of whether or not the action proposed will
even come close to meeting the goals which have been set.

The New York Times, in summarizing the ﬁnal plan of action.
said. “The conference accepted that many women and men. if
given adequate information. general health care and access to a
wide choice of contraceptive methods, will very often
make having fewer children a priority." This is true and will
result in a decline in the rate of population growth, but that
is a far cry from stabilizing the world population at 7.27 bil-
lion.

The world population is right now increasing by about 90
million people a year and has been growing at a rate of l.7 to
2.1 percent per year since the 19503. To put that rate of growth
in perspective, if there had only been two people on the face of
the earth 2,000 years ago and population had grown at a con-
stant rate of 2.0 percent a year, the current population would be
over 317 quadrillion people, 56 million times greater than the
actual population. ii»

And if the actual population 2.0()0 years ago (250 million)
had grown at 2.0 percent until now, the current population
would be around 39 sextillion people or about 2.5 million peo-
ple per square centimeter.

This is the magnitude of growth momentum which the world
needs to halt. The U.N. declaration moves towards those goals.
but is right now nothing more than words on paper. Much more
needs to be done. including active participation by the United
States and making population a more frequently discussed
issue at the United Nations rather than just once-a-decade con-
ferences. If the international community can maintain the spirit
of the population conference, then perhaps we can make signifi-
cant gains in stabilizing the world's population before it is too
late.

versity: I was
surprised to
find out that the margin was
about 4-3. But that statistic
didn't hit home until I read a
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette story
back in November about
Darwin Brown of Wilkinsburg,
who was arrested for stabbing
two people to death and, I am

the top sub.

Other than the facts that we
were teammates and both
black. we had nothing in com-
mon. Darwin was very much
the “homeboy;" he had the
swagger. the lip and the atti-
tude that one may expect from
someone whose education
came primarily from the
streets. On the other hand. I
had transferred at the begin-
ning of my junior year from
Central Catholic. taking col-
lege-prep-courses. playing in
the band and immersing
myself in other activities — no
surprise here. since my parents
were teachers who valued edu-
cation tremendously.

and Darwin was the first to let
out a big laugh. When I actual-
ly did it twice in the next
week. he had the gall to be
angry with me!

As I said earlier. our paths
didn't cross once we left the
court. I had enough credits to
graduate at the end of my
junior year and eventually
went on to college. while
Darwin eventually dropped out
of school entirely. I only saw
him once after that — I ran
into him on the street in the old
neighborhood about I2 years
ago and hadn't even
thought about him at all.

Until November.

It‘s not entirely for me to say

dramatic to say that he and I
grew up together as best
friends but that, while I found
my way in life. he couldn't get
out of the neighborhood and
we ended up drifting apart.
However. that's not what hap-
pened -- indeed. when we
met. we weren't friends at all.
My association with Darwin
started and ended on the bas-
ketball court of a neighbor-
hood church whose youth
leader was attempting to do
ministry to students at
Wilkinsburg High. where we
were both students. Pan of his
outreach was to recruit poten-
tial basketball players for a
church league team he founded
and coached; Darwin. 6-feet-4.
was our center and I was a
swingman, either a starter or

Because of these. I was con-
stantly razzed by my team-
mates. most of whom also
came from the ‘hood. I wore
glasses even on the court (and
I still do so today) and talked
properly and courteously much
of the time. although I could
certainly curse with the best of
them. And because I was
friendly with the few whites on
the team. my “ethnicity" was
also questioned.

Not only that. but my bas-
ketball ability was considered
suspect. I was used to playing
a half-court game. and the
other guys generally played an
up-tempo, fast-break style
which, at times. tired me out.
During one meeting after prac-
tice. I piped up that I could
score 20 points in a game —

survival was all that mattered
to him. Drugs. alcohol and
unbridled sex were not only
not frowned upon: they were
encouraged. On the other
hand.

I stayed away from those
things. became involved in that
church's youth group and. after
a couple of false starts. am try-
ing to make something of my
life.

However. I eventually
learned that I have the ultimate
responsibility for how my life
turns out. and that's not a
lesson easily learned in the
ghetto. Perhaps Darwin Brown
has finally learned that les-
son.The hard way.

“We just didn't take advan-

us."

It cost Pitt the game.

Being the gracious host that
the Buckeyes were. they
decided to make the game

sions.

But being the frugal guest.
Pitt refused all of Ohio State's
gifts. Offended that the
Panthers rudely didn't accept
their generosity. OSU treated
Pitt how ungrateful guests are
treated. by punishing them.

to the curb when it was done.

The main factor that
explained why the Panthers
didn't take the Buckeyes‘ free-
bees was penalties.

Three Pitt drives were killed
by Pitt's self-destruction. The
Panthers looked as tliougli
they u. ere going to frolic the

penalties always stopped them
dead in their tracks.

“We had some critical
penalties --- a lot of penal-
tieis.“ head coach Johnny
Majors said. “The penalty on
the l5- to 20-yard line. it was
a critical penalty of the game."

The penalty that Majors may
have been referring to was the
possession minutes after
David Merrick‘s 37-yard field
goal that brought the Panthers
as close as they would ever
get. 7-3.

l“or the second time 11‘tLl\
l11;i11_\ meetings. the Pitt soccer
lL‘LtIl1 40-1 in the Big East; 3-1
oxeralli tasted hitter defeat at
the hands of the (ieorgetow 11
Ht)};t\ 12-0. 5-1 1.

In late (.)etoher of last year.
it was the Hoyas who came to
Pitt Stadium and eliminated
the Panthers from competing
in the Big East Tournament.

The two teams met yester-
day for the first time since the
Panthers‘ elimination. in Pitt's
first Big East Conference
game of the year.

Looking for revenge. the Pitt
soccer team headed into Hoya
land and left defeated. again.
Yet. unlike last year's 3-()
shutout. the Panthers made it
close. losing by one. 3-2.

The rematch was marred
with 49 total penalties. The
Panthers had 29 and the Hoyas
had 20.

In goal. Pitt iietminder Kirk
Brodows had only two saves
while his counterpart. Phil
Wellington. had four in victo-
ry. Georgetown put pressure
on the Panthers. outshooting
them 17-10.

It was the Hoyas drawing
first blood in this rematch.
scoring twice in the first half.
Georgetown‘s Ben McKnight
was able to get the first shot
past Brodows at 5:49 of the
first period. Brodows. who had
battled Adam Spitzer in the
preseason for the starting job.
got the nod over Spitzer for
the third time this year.

The score increased to 2-0
when Chris Jones reached the
net at 37:52 of the first half on
an assist by Tim Keegan.

Scoreless in the first half.
the Panthers got back into
reach of the Hoyas with a goal
by Eric Prex at 51:22 of the
second half. Prex is Pitt's lead-
ing goal scorer with five on
the season.

No sooner had Prex put the
Panthers back into the game
then Tom Greaser shot what
would ttim out to be the game-
winning goal at 53:53.

Making a last effort drive in
hope of overcoming the two-
point deficit. John Lopus.
(who scored his first goal of
the season) got the Panthers
within one goal at 85:21 of the
match. Yet. for Lopus and the
Pitt soccer team. it was not
enough. and the memory of
last year still haunts them.

The Panthers are one of four
teams that fell victim to the
Hoyas. Only North Carolina
State was able to defeat
Georgetown. 2-1.

said. "\VC were H\Ct'pti\s cictl.
()ur qti;irtcrb;ic'k made good
plays but had to struggle at
times to stay alive."

The Panthers failed on third
and long in their attempt to turn
the Hoying interception itito
points. a trend that would
plague the Panthers all game.
Pitt wasn‘t able to convert any
of the five ()SLl turnovers into
scores.

The Buckeyes took the Pitt
punt and showed what they
could do when they weren‘t
turning the ball over. putting
together a l-1-play. 90-yard
drive that chewed up 6:48 of
clock. lt was one of four
extended scoring drives on the
day for the Buckeyes.

But despite Pitt‘s shortcom-
itigs. it stayed in the game.

“We were in the game for
three quarters. I’d say. to sortie
degree." Majors said.

“We were out of it in the first
quarter last year." he said.
referring to Pitt's 63-28 loss to
the Buckeyes in last season's
meeting. in which Pitt was
down 28-(l after the first quarter
and 35-0 at halftime.

Pitt‘s Mark Butler returned
the kickoff following the
Buckeyes‘ first score 4() yards
to the Pitt 45.

A West burst up the middle
for l7 yards on a draw play
highlighted the Panthers‘ move
into Buckeye territory. But after
a West run around left end for o
yards brought the Panthers to
the OSU 22. West was hit for a
3—yard loss. again by Brown.

On third and seven Fitzgerald
threw complete to wide receiv-
er Dietnch Jells. who was tack-
led 2 yards shy of the first
down marker. Pitt kicker David
Merrick's 37-yard field goal
attempt was good. cutting the
OSU lead to 7-3.

But with 10 minutes left in
the half. Ho_ving. who had
dropped back to throw. spotted
an open running lane and raced
down the OSU sideline for -15
yards. He was finally chased
down by linebacker Jason
Chavis at the Pitt 18.

Four plays later. Hoying hit
ﬂanker Buster Tillman slanting
into the end zone for the touch-
down and a 14-3 OSU lead.

With 1:33 left in the half. the
Panthers went to a strange for-
mation that .\la_iors called
“hull_\-gully football." trying to
catch the Buckeyes by surprise.

The unbalanced shotgun used
a quarterback. a wide receiver.
a center-eligible. and another

°From page 9

you are.

"The teams (at the RMC
tournament: kind of self-
destructed. Just when they
would start to make a run at
us. they would do something
to self-destruct. So it’s tough
to say if we've improved (our
concentration) or not."

The Panthers were led
throughout the Volle_\'Fest by
all—touniament team selections
.\lelanie (iustafson and Sara
Mitchell.

Senior middle hitter
Uustafsoii tore up the tourna-
ment field with -13 kills along
with sex en blocks over the
weekend matches. Against
Marshall in Pitt‘s second
match of the tournament.
Gustafson trampled the Lady
Herd with a blistering .900 hit-
ting percentage.

Senior outside hitter
Mitchell rifled through the
competition with 46 kills. 41
digs and four service aces.

Senior outside hitter Carrie
Thornton was another of Pitt’s
top perfonners over the week-
end. Against Duquesne. she
led both squads with I6 kills.

With the 4-0 weekend
sweep. the Panthers improved
their season record to 6-4.

Coach Alvear and the
Panthers should have an excel-
lent chance to judge their men-
tal toughness this Friday. when
they travel to Lincoln for the
University of Nebraska
Invitational Tournament.
There. the Panthers will take
on the host Comhuskers. who
are currently ranked No. 2 in
the nation. as well as the
Kansas Jayhawks team that
defeated the Panthers at
Fitzgerald Field House last
year.

Column-

°From page 9

Moments after the score, the
Pitt recovered a fumble on the
Ohio State 46-yard line. After
an 18-yard Fitzgerald strike to
Mark Butler, the Panthers
appeared that they might take
the lead. But a holding penalty
on the next play wiped out
Pitt's hopes. It forced a second
and I9 situation that Pitt could
never overcome.

“We got into too many see-
ond-and-long and third-and-
long situations." offensive
coordinator Ken Karcher said.

“I think sometimes we have
the tendency to allow the big
play or come up with a penal-
ty." linebacker Tom Tumulty
said. “We'll look at it. correct
it and put it behind us."

‘Regardless of the score. or
Pitt's ineptness to score. there
IS an invaluable moral in the
game: Take what is given.
because if you don‘t then you
will be left with a soggy cigar.

Sean Duncan is the assis-

tant sports editor of The Pitt
News.
