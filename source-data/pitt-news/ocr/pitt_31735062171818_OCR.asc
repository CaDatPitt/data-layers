Petition Being Circulaterl

Treaty Referendum
May Be Upcoming

A University stand on the con-

troversial People’s Peace Treaty

may be forthcoming.

According to Jerry Thomas of
the Peace Treaty Information
Committee, a petition asking for
an official referendum on the
Treaty is being circulated.

When 900 signatures are re-
ceived. the Student Association
(SA) will hold a referendum to de-
termine student policy. If the
treaty is approved in the contest,
the SA will exert pressure on the
University and the government
to end the war in May and to get
the military-industrial complex
off campus.

If it fails, the SA will oppose it.

The petition being circulated,
through, is not the treaty itself

but simply a request for a ref-
erendum.

According to Tom Overcash.
also of the Information Commit-
tee. the signatures are being rap-
idly accumulated. “We have a lit.-
tle over 500 after only two days.
It's just a matter of time now."

The referendum would be held
well before the current term is
over and hopefully only a week
after all 900 signatures are
gathered.

Thomas indicated also that the
ballot would probably have sev-
eral degrees of response. rather
than just yes-no answers.

The entire Peace Treaty opera-
tion is geared for action in the
first week of May, when a mas-
sive assembly in Washington.
D. C., will call for an immediate
end to the Vietnam war.

"Open for Business“ is more or
less the attitude in the Student As-
sociation office.

The success of the three newly
organized committees — Legal
Awareness. Off Campus Housing
and Student Health Organization
——can be measured in terms of
student participation.

Already the Student Health Or-
ganization has been working in
conjunction with the Health Serv-
ice to “devise vast reforms in the
present health services offered
to students.“ said Wade Lawson.
Committees Commissioner of the
Student Association.

The Student Health Organiza-
tion will announce its progress
early next week.

vestigated for substandard living
facilities and is now viable for

Yellow Submarine fans, disap-
pointed, were turned away into
the cold Winter Week-end, with
nothing to do . . . unless they want-
ed to watch the film shown to re-
place it.

The crowds who came to watch
The Gladiator last Saturday were
also out of luck. The Bicycle Thief
was shown instead and the second

.showing was completely elimin-

ated. So audience number two had
to go home.

Another audience who missed

And students have been ask-
ing, “What has been happening to
our flicks lately?” '

On March 3, the New Line Cine-

arrived. Its whereabouts are un-
known and perhaps it was lost in
transit.

Since its incipience not long
ago, the Legal Awareness Com-
mittee has dealt with three cases.
It involved itself with the two
most recent drug arrests, and
provided the legal information for
an off campus housing issue.

Legal Awareness is also plan-
ning to issue a pamphlet concern-
ing avenues of complaint
open to student renters.

Besides these three committees.
other resources are worthy of
student interest and awareness.

The Calendar Committee. head-
ed by Lee Elder. is trying to co-
ordinate all campus activities
onto a schedule. "If we get all
campus activities scheduled be-
forehand, they'll get the publicity
they deserve.“ Lawson said.
“Hopefully there won't be any
more mix-ups,“ he added.

Because the Spirit and Tradi-
tions Committees received only
two applications during the drive
for committee membership, Wade
Lawson considers these as “ter-
minated due to lack of interest.”

“Spirit is an aesthetic principle
which either exists or doesn‘t.“
Lawson said.

If an effort to keep students in-
formed about “what‘s going on“
in the Student Association. via the
media, two previous committees
—Community Relations and Pub-
lic Relations—have been merged.

One responsibility of the new

‘Community and Public Relation

Committee will be to deal exten-
sively with the Oakland Com-
munity, by contacting local news-
papers and organizations.

“I think this is essential.“ said
Lawson, “because the Commun-
ity‘s image of Pitt students is
very bad and completely nega-
tive. (“

“Also," he said. “there are
services open to community par-
ticipation, such as the leisure
learning programs at Trees Hall.“

A third responsibility of the
Community and Public Relations
Committee will be to act as a stu-
dent information resource.

“If we don’t have an answer to
a question, we’ll get it,” Lawson
promised. “We all know problems
exist,” he said. “but sometimes
we just don’t know where to get
an answer. I think this committee
is needed."

Lawson also commented on the
amount of criticism heaped upon
such student services as the Sig‘:
dent Association, Black Action
Society and Pitt News.

“If they closed down tomorrow,
who would provide the services?”
he asked.

“But without criticism. and es-
pecially without attitudes,
can‘t progress."

John Kerr. a Pitt junior. was
elected to the national presiden-
cy of the College I)emocratic
Clubs of America in February.

During his 12-month term. Kerr
hopes to mobilize young l)emo—
(rats and increase the number of
young delegates at the l)emo-
cratic convention of 1972.

"l<‘irst. we plan to raise enough

money to allow 100 young people
between the ages of 21 and 27 to
run for delegates.“ he explained.
A An investigation of the McGov-
ern and 0’Hara commissions is
part of the group’s plan to clarify
the methods of delegate selection
and to bring about a broader rep-
resentation of delegates. “We
want 25 per cent of the ’7?. del-
egation to be under 25 years of
age,” Kerr stated.

He went on to explain how the
young Democrats plan to influ-
ence the trend of delegate selec-
tion. Film stars Jane Fonda and
Paul Newman have agreed to help
the group‘ to raise money and to
attract young presidential candi-
dates. "Instead of going to them
for delegates. they’ll come to us

‘ for support.“ Kerr said.

College Democratic Clubs are
now active in 44 states. Kerr
hopes to expand the organization's
national membership with a pub-
lic relations drive. The young

,Ke1'1'Electe(l President
Of National Democ 'als

party president is anxious to see
the election “of someone who will
change things.” And with enough
support from _vouth. Kerr plans
to rock the party. “We‘ll threaten
them with the young. so they‘ll
have to make changes.

We want to define the goals of
the party," he commented.

I\'err. a prospective law stu-
dent. credits his own election to
“an ability to bring people togeth-
er.“ And he is optimistic about
strengthening yotiths involve-
ment in part_v politics during his
term. Commenting on his own
political stance. Kerr said. “I‘m
as liberal as I can be and still
work within the system.“

At a national convention of the
College Democratic Clubs Feb.
14. Kerr upset the incumbent fav-
orite Steve Dailey. a student f'rom
the University of Indiana. The
former president of Pitts Young
Democrats decided to run in De-
cember and. with the public rela-
tions ability of his campagin man-
ager.Ron Chesin. a Pitt law stu-
dent. Kerr was able to gain the en-
dorsement of both Milton Shapp
and the Democratic Party of Alle-
gheny County. ’

Kerr also credited his experi-
ence as a William Pitt Debater
and a published platform as aids
in helping him carry all the North-
eastern and Southern states rep-
resented at the convention.

Lately the Pitt News has been
publicizing a lot of information
concerning tenants rights. In are-
cent edition of the paper a state-
ment of the Rent Withholding Act
was printed which proved benefi-
cial to the residents of 69 Lawn
St.. the property of Kamin Realty.

A disconcerted tenant of the
building. Frank Little. who is
also chairman of the Off-Campus
Housing Committee. made sever-
al repair requests which were ig-
nored by his landlord. Concerned
about the perilous conditions of
his $150 plus apartment. Little
contacted the Allegheny Depart-
ment of Health about rent with-
holding.

According to the Health Depart-
ment. if a building merits a mini-
mum of 20 points it is liable for
rent withholding. Three apart-
ments at the Lawn St. premises
were assessed by an investiga-
tor at 44. 38 and 31 points.

Little described some of the
conditions that warranted the neg-
ative appraisal:

"First of all. there is no pro-
vision for heating in the bath-
room. The windows don‘t open.
some are even nailed shut (which
is in violation of the fire code) and

most of the window frames are
rotted.

"The hot water heater is in the

kitchen against the wall that ad-

joins the bathroom. They cut a
two foot ho.le in the wall to con-
nect the heater with the bath-
room plumbing and then stuffed
the area with newspapers. The in-
spector agreed that the set-up was
a definite fire hazard.

“In the apartment upstairs, the
back of the fireplace is the out-

side wall of the building. The
loose, crumbling mortar is the
cause of terrible drafts of cold
air. There is also a hole in the
floor under the rug that is large
enough to put your foot through.”

Little was surprised to discover
that his building is listed in the
off-campus housing office as “lux-
ury, remodeled apartments." He
suggested that perhaps the term
“remodeled" referred to the work
done on the building after it was
condemned.

Responsibility to the students and to
members of the community seems to have

0* hit,an all time low in the person of

Da’vid,Smith, University Treasurer.

Recently, Ralph Nader, America’s
consumer superstar,’ requested that the
University transfer», its proxy voting

A  privilege, from the 10,200-Pitt owned

shares of Union Carbide, to himself or
a Nader representative. Smith respond-

b ed that the University could not legally

delegate voting power, but had directly

contacted the management of Union

Carbide to express concern.

The reason for Nader’s appeal to the
University is that Carbide is a major
polluter, and one that has refused to
abide by many of the pollution laws. It
is ‘his hope that by rallying enough

; votes in the upcoming share holders el-

ection he can. force Union Carbide to
change it’s pollution habits.

, When Smith states that the Univer-
sity cannot legally delegate voting pow-
er he strikes avery disharmonious note.
I wonder whether Mr. Smith meant that
the University has no power to vote for
whom it pleases or whether Mr. Smith

0 means that no matter who best serves

tends to vote for management... Neither

interests of both the corporation and
pubhcf’

I wonder if Mr. Smith feels that the
contamination of this planet’s air with
300,000 pounds of pollutants a day,
that’s right, a day, is in the public inter-
est.

As far as the brilliant strategic mas-
terpiece. of having members of the
Board of Trustees contact Union Car-
bide to express concern over their pol-
lution, I wonder if Mr. Smith really be-
lieves that ittakes one ‘to know one. Af-
ter all, how many of the Trustees are
members of U._S. Steel, Gulf Oil’,
or some other corporation which ranks

high on the “Who’s Who in American A

Pollution?”

Mr. Smith continues in his letter.
“Should events lead the University to
question it’s confidence in management,

‘it will take appropriate action, includ-

ing further consultation with manage-
ment . . . ” Mr. Smith makes me cur-g

ious what would lead the University to »

question its confidence in management.
If 300,000 pounds of pollutants per day
are not enough to question the’confi-
dence of this University in Union Car-
bide’s management. . . .what is? .

I think what Mr. Smith, with his had-
ministrative arrogance and in his zeal
for the preservation of the status quo,
fails to realize is that the great major-.
ity of the students at this University are
here because it is the first step intheir
quest for a better life, for themselves and
for their children. The kind of ignorance
and disregard for life that Mr. Smith
has shown, will certainly never lend to
thatgoal.

:iuI'Iil0II carbide And Pin: Purinersln Pollution},

Carbide Nor Smith “Responsible”

(Editor's Note: Following is the reply of
University Treasurer David Smith .to Marc
Hiller”, Pitt SEA/ZPG head, after Hiller queried
the administration in the Union Carbide Cor-
poration.)

Let me respond to your specific ques-
tion of why the University purchased this
stock. This was done some time ago. (Our
investment, portfolio undergoes continuing
turnover as market conditions, prices,
opportunities change.) The selection was
made on the normal investment basis of
the anticipated dividend return and the pos-
sibilities for growth in value.

I

Our investment analyst is reponsible
for evaluating those financial factors. He.
of course, cannot be familiar with the

lmethods of operation and procedures at

each of the facilities owned by the major

companies in which the Universities,en- '

downment is invested, which at times num-

bers nearly 100. He must make his deci-

sions on the basis of the total performance
of the company.

Regarding voting rights of the Univer-
sity-owned stock, since it is the Universi-
ty investment policy to hold only securities
of corporations in whose management’ it
has confidence,- the University intends to

vote as a general rule its stock in favor of’

management.

While it is the fiduciary responsibility of
the Board of Trustees to make investments
that will preserve endowment capital and
provide a reasonable rate of income return,
we also feel that the securities of any cor-

 

   

poration that does not conduct its affairs
in keeping with the general public interest
is not likely to produce the best long-term
results.

The University, therefore, is perfectly
willing to make recommendations to man-
agement for improvement in policy when
it is felt that changes would be in the best
long-term interests of both the corpora-
tion and the public. Should events lead the
University to question its confidence in-
management, it will take appropriate ac-
tion, including further consultation with

management, to resolve any doubt and! ‘

failing this, will dispose of the security.

With regardto the two reported circum-

stances involving Union Carbide, one of the '

Trustees has been informed that manage-
ment now considers correction of such
problems to have very high priority.

As a stockholder, the University has
urged Union Carbide Corporation to deal
rapidly and effectively with the pollution
problem reported at some of its plants. We
shall continue to monitor this situation in

. accordance with the foregoing principles.

The Investment Committee of the Board
of Trustees has authorized me, the Treas-

urer of the University, to convey to the, "

management of any company in which the
University has an investment reasonable

. inquiries received from members of the

University community concerning com-
pany policies and actions. To this end,
please feel free to bring me any further
information or questions on our invest-
ments at any time.

The limits of the powers of
enforcement: '

Art. III: 2; 1. “The judicial_
power shall extend to all-cases, 47
in law & equity, arising under -_
‘this Constitution,
the United States, and Treaties‘, ,-
made, or which shall be made,.

Under their authority.”

Art. VI: 2. “This Constitutir3n,;

thereof, and all treaties made, '

Conclusion: Anything not men- C

Astro-turf ‘deleterious’

To the Editor, The Pitt News,

_ and Fellow Students:

Our campus sits along the north-
west edge of Escambia Bay,
which empties into the Gulf of
Mexico at Pensacola, Fla. So far
this year, Escambia Bay has suf-
fered over 60 major fish kills,
each one of close to or more than
a million fish—food fish, sport
fish, “commercial fish." you
name it.

ed, we have concluded that only
economic sanctions can force the
industries involved to recycle
sanctions can force the industries
involved to recycle their wastes
and quit using the Escambia Riv-
er — the public domain — for a
dump.

We intend to take sanctions
against all industries, of which
there are six locally, dumping into
the Escambia River and the bay.

 

These kills have been traced to
industries and municipalities just
just north of and on the bay, which
have been using the Escambia
River and the bay for a dump. One
such industry is Monsanto Co.,
which, as of January, 1970, was
dumping into the river and the
bay, the following wastes:

10,000 lbs/day 5 day biological ozygen de-
mand

3,900 lbs/ day total organic carbon

1,875 lbs/day TKN

1,331 lbs/day nitrite nitrogen

1,104 lbs/day ammonia nitrogen and nitrite
421 lbs/day total phosphate
264 lbs/day ortho phosphate

One of Monsanto’s most adver-

' tised and ecologically deleteri-

ous products is Astro Turf, an ar-
tificial grass; some of its other
products are Arochlor (1250)
compounds and herbicides.

Because our public officials
have been tragically slow to res-
pond, and because citizen initi-

ated “pollution control" legisla-.

tion is being successively weaken-
ed and stifled and will have only
moderate “success" if ever pass-

To establish our effectiveness, we
have decided to begin by calling
for a boycott of Astro Turf, the
Monsanto product that depends
most heavily on the college mar-
ket.

We desperately need your sup-
port. There is nothing less at
stake than the bay itself———the bay
which is a integral part of our bio-
sphere, is essential to a balanced
environment.

It docsn’t take much though to
realize that Escambia Bay IS
about as important to you as it is
to us. By supporting our boycott
you not only deny revenue to an
enemy of the bay, you also help
assert, for once, that our waters
and our skies are not dumps and
that even large industries must

be held responsible for their-

wastes.

—-We ask that you put up with nat-
ural grass for a good while long-
er.

_~—We ask that you compel your

frineds and local industries_not

Conley rapped
on CSO view”

To‘ the Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to comment on Mr.
Conley’s remarks concerning the

Committee on Student Organiza-.

tions. Outside of the fact that he is
completely wrong in his accusa-
tions, he did not even attempt to
verify them. As an editor of a pa-
per this is unforgiveable.

To answer these charges direct-
ly is a simple matter. First, there
are only two reasons why an or-
ganization’s recognition will be
held up.

Failure to complete the applica-

tion requirements, or a failure of .

the Student Association to meet
andratify the CSO’s actions.

The Committee meets once each
week and actson all complete ap-
plications. Mr. Conley never
bothered to check on this with any
of the Committee or our advisor,
Mrs. Haley.

It would seem that a salaried
member of a staff could do better
than this.

Pitt News Drama

If it were not as a dream, the
reality of the magic of the
“moonlit wood” would be too
stark to handle. It is always the

' case, that the undefinable spirits

which sway the emotions and
cause men to play “the ass" are
divided from reality, and in truth
they must be.

. How else may we explain
the supernatural “fairies of the
wood" from whose realm havoc
and delight are superimposed
upon the real life that is “in
dreams recalled.“ One realm.
the comic spirit, is where Puck
the prankish elf (the clown)
serves his master. He who is
the buffoon, the master of revels,
plays a develish cupid from
where the riddles that explain our
strange “creature” behavior are
to be found in creation—even as
their source is yet unexplained.

It is in this one realm, and yet
the other “real and rational one"
in which our lovers are found in
triangle, in trouble, and then
out again . . finding at last
glance their climatic partners.
“The players” are there, also
between the real and the wood,
making haste to prepare a
play for the wedding of the
Duke Thesius to Hippolyta.

Bottom, a member of the troop,
is turned “ass” between dream
and reality and the fairy queen
Titania makes love to “that ass”

. . but does not know why. It
is the secret of the flower that
Puck plays with, and causes
havoc with, among the mortals
that is the significance. It is
each character who delves into
the mystery yet can not solve
it-but are only vaguely aware
of the source of love’s effect on
their rational selves. It is the
flower that is love in dormancy

. inactivity. . . idleness. It is
the dream where man is crea-
ture and beyond the control of
reason for days or moments
between realms. an unex-
plained element in human af-
fairs.

   

When Philostrate becomes
Puck we are through the plane
that divides one realm from the
other. It is Puck. who in front
of our eyes gives us the “dream“

to spill over-as the shrewd elf g

steps forward into the rational
and back again, “flower of love"
in hand. Such a step is at odds
with the order of things.

It is Puck again, who in his
error, reveals love as a disturb-

ing element- a interruption
apart from life itself. From
these things, the comedy is
spun.

The joy of Shakespeare’s “Mid-
summer Night’s Dream” lingers
long after with the secret of
the preposterously absurd, but
very real comedy, whose mys-
tery calls to our minds the very
“dreamlike intangible force”
that in reality is the order of
our very\universe—still unyield-
ing the secrets it holds.

When Puck enters the stage,
his nimble feet and smile be-
guile us into thinking him only
the buffoon. Perhaps he is
more. Torn Spinella, _in a abso-

lutely supurb portrayal. presents ‘

this child of mischief in a fash-
ion that endears us to the elf
who creates mirth and mystery.
It is he who succumbs to error,
but who goes about correcting

his mistakes with as much glee"

as he did to create them.

He is there and not there.
His hands fly. . .his feet rev up
and zoom as Shakespeare’s
“road-runner“ is off and away.
His inflection is diverse, his
eyes twinkle and his hands flap.
This is Spinella’s most master-
ful portrayal.

A stage that is Shakespeare is
somewhere between the classic
form and what many directors
have said “must be updated for
modern audiences to under-
stand.” What of that thing
called “two realms?” Their dis-
appearance is easily accomplish-
ed, but at the expense of the
form itself. It is Leland Starne’s

conception of the “dream” and

“reality” apart and together and

his expression of the two super-
imposed upon the other that holds
the “form” intact yet makes this
play not only enjoyable but
meaningful and fun.

He has not changed Shakes-
peare, but clarified him and it
is this expression in superior
staging and timely expression in
movement and dialogue that he
has succeeded with. As the sev-
eral plots are intertwined, un-
raveled, and raveled it is still
the Shakespearian form that re-
mains: lightly meshed and ex-
pounded_with a total effect that
gives full light to the comedy
and gaiety of love and all its
mystery.

He has given two roles to one:
Theseus/Oberon (Bert Nemitz),
Hippolyta/Titania (Francine
Nemitz) and Philostrate/Puck
(Tom Spinella) with success,
serving to clarify and mystify
the dream for more understand-
ing. He has double cast Helena
(Linda Loxterman and Valerie
Ososky) and Hermia (Alice La
Rosa and Renee Giovane) almost
successfully.

It is Renee Giovane who toys
with her role a little too much.
She is not fine when she can not
seem to change moods nor enrich

.her character with a delicate

balance. She causes her charact-
er to punch at you. Hermia is to
be filled with the tiger . . but
never to thump . . . thump . . .
thump.

It is Alice LaRosa who de-
livers a beautiful and sensitively
energetic portrayal of Hermia,
so much so that her performance

is at times captivating. She is.

remarkably accurate in her de-
livery of a major role and excit-
ing on Foster’s stage.

Valerie Ososky is absolutely
marvelous in her role. She puts
her whole self into the charact-
er. . . her face wrinkles with con-
fusion as she hungers with a per-
fect thirst for the one whom she

. loves. She delivers an accurate

portrayal with a comic adept-
ness that makes her performance
superior and perhaps her finest
on the Pitt stage.

It is also Linda Loxterman who
seems to be at her best . . but at
the height of confusion looses
some of the comedian. In this

area she misses just a little, but

strikes a lovely pose and fine
characterization to give Helena
accuracy that is above average
in performance, but firing the
role with just a little less than
it may call for.

Bert Nemitz is strong in
every major aspect and it is in
this characterization that he

again delivers a portrayal con- _

sistent with his long list of suc-
cessful performances. On occas-
sion he speeds Elizabethian verse
should never be rushed to mis-
understanding but proved “cor-
rection” on my second view-
ing. Francine Nemitz is devast-
ingly impressive — delivering a
marvelous portrayal in the exe
cution of her role. She presents
perhaps her most impressive
portrayal for Pitt theatre.

Dennis Grossman as Demetr-
ius delivers his best perfor-
mance yet at this university.
He was “naturally" Demetrius

. and fell into the role with
such ease that delivery and phys-
ical movement combine to
make his performance superior to
his past and in the present.

Rick Applegate, as Lysander,
is richly deserving of praise. His
delivery and movement offer a
diversity in characterization that
is a joy to encounter.

Bill Campbell (Quince) is
at his best in this play. He is
superior in all aspects. and
consistently delivers the type
of performance that I‘ve been
waiting to see him do and that
is splendid stuff.

And of course Bottom.

marvelous on that stage. He re-
strains himself just enough to

Close, But
Not Quite

by MARTY HELLMAN
In the closing minutes of the Pitt-North Carolina State
basketball game many fans in the student section began chant-
ng "NIT, NIT“ as they watched the Panthers whip the Wolfpack
in convincing style.

For the first time in seven years, Pitt fans and the local me-
dia began speaking about the possibility of two Pittsburgh col-
lege hoop squads gaining national recognition and berths in
post-season tourneys.

Subsequent key losses by the Panthers shattered any hopes
for a bid, leaving the Duquesne Dukes as the only standard
bearer for the Steel City. 0

Although the Panther’s 14-
10 overall record is the best
achieved at the Field House
since the 1964 NIT club, their
inability to play tough in the
final moments of at least five
contests spelled the difference
between good and great.

In the earlier stages of the
campaign, defeats at both
Fordham and Kent State re-
sulted from the teams col-
lapsing in the last two—three
minutes. Recently, Temple, West Virginia and Penn State were
able to overcome Panther leads in the last minutes.

Coach Buzz ‘Ridl realizes that the Panthers lacked’ that lit-
tle bit extra. “We need to have our players gain more confi-
dence in themselves for the tough games so we can pull them
out," he stated. “They were not consistently shooting and scor-
ing under pressure."

 

BUZZ RIDL

Injuries played an important role in the Panthers’ perform?

ance. From the outset of practice, guard Cleveland Edwards
was unavailable due to knee problems. Ridl admits that Cleve’s
presence may have turned a few ball games around.

Two ankle injuries to Mike Paul and Buzzy Harrison hamp-
ered the teams performance down the home stretch. "Mikes
injury hurt us more than we realized and with Buzzy hurt for
West Virginia and Georgia Tech our effectiveness was cut
down." Ridl commented.

Nevertheless, there were many bright moments for the
club this season. Victories against Wisconsin. Duquesne. (who
really expected that‘?). Davidson and NC State proved that the
basketball Panther is on the long road back.

“Those were real fine wins,” said a smiling Ridl. “We
stayed in control of the game and we were a very tough ball
club.”

Individually, several ballplayers showed improvement
over last year and the sophomore additions to the squad show-
ed great promise. *

Fans may still smirk at Paul O'Gorek‘s semi—awkward
shooting style, but the big center’s aggressiveness and durabil-
ity under the boards give him claim to the most improved Pan-
ther since last year. Besides leading the team in reboundl OG
paced the scoring parade in six games.

Although Kent Scott’s scoring average is down from his
sophomore season, the “Hawk” contributed more on defense
and played less time, according to Ridl. Mike Paul, though in-
consistent, proved to be a top notch shooter.

Harrison, Carl Morris and Bill Sulkowski contributed great-
ly in their first varsity year. Buzzy received recognition in
Basketball Weekly‘s soph honorable mention and Morris and
Sulkowski were valuable assets underneath the boards.

The only regular missing from next year’s roster will be
senior Bill Downes, who excited the fans this year with his over-
ly aggressive defense and consistent shooting. Added to next
year‘s edition of Ridl’s squad could include several members of
this season’s remarkable freshman squad, which clobbered
most of its opponents enroute to a 13-4 mark.

Besides Jim Bolla, Sam Fleming and Mickey I Martin, Ridl
can count on Billy Knight, who will also be elgible to play.

The return of the majority of this year’s squad plus the new-
comers gives Ridl probably the nicest “problem" since his ar-
rival at Pitt: Decisions about the starting five and the remain-
der of the squad are going to be difficult at best.

Despite the encouraging aspects of next season. Ridl feels
that the past one was good. Perhaps he was pondering the last
few moments of one of those losses when he said wishfully.
“Two or three more wins would have been a nice way to end my
third year here——-we may have gone to the NIT."

The feeling here is that next year. Buzzy won't have to be
wishing and Pitt fans will get a chance to root for Pitt in a post-

season tourney.

' athletic career here at Pitt.

in fact that he was drafted by the
San Diego Chargers football team
in the fifth round of this year‘s
college draft.

As an athlete at South Hills
High, Salter concentrated on the
high jump and competed in the
triple jump on the side. At Pitt,
however, he likes both jumps
equally well. "

“I love the high jump,” he said.
“It requires a lot of finess. The
triple jump is more of a power-
type thing. It’s a matterof getting’
the skills down. As far as winning
goes I’ve done better in the triple
but I like the high jump equally
well.”

Four members of the swimming team left for Penn State this
morning for the annual Eastern Championships, an invitational tour-
nament sponsored by the Ivy League Schools. The competition, which
includes almost 30 schools on the eastern coast and inland, will be-
gin tomorrow and last through Saturday.

Acting Coach Dick Bradshaw has had the team on a tapering pro-
gram all week in order to ease up to the meet and the swimmers feel up
for the competition.

Team captain Dave Wessel, who
won’t be attending Easterns this
year due to the long trip (How-
ever, he will be going to Nation-
als), remarked, “The swimmers
really want to swim. They should

and deserve.” Last year at East-

ePasqua noticed one of his form-,

“Why' don't you come on out?"
ePasqua laughed. “You don’t

The Panther coach was joking

ast two seasons, but he admitted
ater that he is very concerned
bout his reserves as spring ball

It was football weatherat Pitt Stadium yesterday.

V The 1971 Pitt spring football drills were starting a day late be-
“cause of the low temperatures of the day before. but the mercury was
still as low as 30 degrees around 4:20 p.m. yesterday when 81 pros-
pects braved Carl DePasqua‘s workouts.

. You weren't there unless you had to be. with a few exceptions.
There were just a handful of onlookers at the Stadium. a couple high
chool gridders. some ex-Pitt football players who had played their
-final Panther game just a few months ago.

“Well, the thing we did then was
that we went downhill," DePas-

qua recalled after
opening drills.

yesterdays
“Fundamentally

we didn‘t have the men prepared I

to fill in for the injured guys. We‘ll
have to work more with our back-
up men this time."

Overall DePasqua probably
won‘t have as much depth to work
with this year, so an injury prob-
lem as severe as last fall’s could
once again be devastating. But
there‘s one area where he will
be very deep——and he plans on tak-
ing advantage.

There are five candidates at
quarterback and the talent is
there. Last season’s top two sig-
nal callers, Dave Havern and John
Hogan, are back and three top
challengers awaiting a chance
are Bob Medwid, Rod Huth and

Dan Rullo. The number three man

from last fall, Tom Hasbaugh, has

switched to defensive back where
-the opportunity for advancement
is greater.

Because of the quarterbacking
depth, DePasqua will follow
through on last falls plans of in-
stituting a new offense which will
include more of the triple option.

“We planned it last year, but
had to stop because Havern and
Hogan got chopped up (through

injuries).” the coach said. “Now _

we have the back-up people to do
it."

If the football weather wasn't
around to remind DePasqua about
problems like depth, he'd still be
worrying about finding back-up
men and starters for the future.

Last night after the first work-
out, he was telling assistant coach
Serafino “Foge” Fazio how to get
to a potential recruit’s house.
Fazio, who would soon be on his
way to talk to the high school star,
has been giving much of his time
to recruiting efforts lately. As a
change, he enjoyed getting back
out on the field yesterday.

“It was great, man,” he said.

“But you can’t let down on this
recruiting — it’s important.”

' Cir] Cagers
Capture ‘8th
Against State

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

The women cagers hammered
out a 66-31 victory over Penn

State, Beaver extension. Monday

night at Trees Hall Gym.

“We got a lot of points on our
fast breaks." explained Pitts co-
captain Phyllis Wojciechowski.

“Everyone was shooting and
most important everyone was hit-
ting.

Wojciechowski was high scorer,
coming in with 30 points. She is
also the season’s high scorer for
Pitt; her best game was against
Carnegie-Mellon when she cop-
ped 28 points.

The other top shooter for Pitt
was co-captain Elaine Kingas
with 12 points.

Although the starters played
only two quarters, Pitt never re-
linquished the lead. Pitt Coach
Sandra Bullman cleared the bench
as she has done in previous games
and everyone on the squad saw
action.

The win boosted Pitt’s season
record to 8-2. The only losses
were to West Chester and Kent
State.

The basketball season will end
in a home game tonight against
Slippery Rock State College.

“I’m really looking forward to
this game," stated Wojciechow-
ski. “It’s going to be a rough
game.

“The teams are equal in ability
and it’s going to be aclose game.

“The defense will play an,im-
portant part in the contest.“

Reggins, Flash 

 

To Semi-Finals

The Reggins defeated Phi Gamma Delta, 56-50, and the Black
Flash beat the Civil Engineers, 90-31. in the quarter—finals of the All-
Campus Intramural Basketball Championship Monday. The two win-
ners played Tuesday night in the semi-final round of the championship.

The Black Flashes took an ear-
ly lead and kept it throughout the
game. In the first half the Civil
Engineers struggled to make a
basket for every two baskets that.
the Flashes made. At the end of
the first period the score was 30-
13. Then in the second half. eight
minutes went by without the En-
gineers making a single point as
the A Flashes finally out scored
them 60-18 in that half.

Bill Knight of the Black Flash-
es had 40 points to claim scoring
honors. Dave Cosnek led the Engi-
neers with 11 points. Both teams
had 6-O records going into Mon-
day night’s game.

In the other game that night,
the Reggins‘won their right to

play the Junior Dents in the semi-
finals.

The game was close until the
last minute of playp at which
point Phi Gamma Delta pulled to
wintin four points of the Reggins.

But the Reggins refused to fold’

under pressure and the drive by
Fiji stopped.

John Lewis was unstoppable
for the Reggins for the entire
game. He led all scorers with 21
points. Dave Krugh led the Fijis
in ther efforts with long shots and
driving layups. Krugh led the
team’s scoring with 18 points.
Krugh and his squad were helped
greatly by the rebounding of Tom
Porecca. The backboards were
still controlled by Lewis, John
Simpson and Joe Carrol of the
Reggins.

After the game John Lewis com-
mented on his team saying, “It
took a great effort on our part to
win tonight, I'm sure we can do it
again tomorrow against the
Junior Dents.”

Both teams were undefeated go-
ing in Monday’s game. The win-
ner of the Reggis, Junior Dents
game will meet either the Black
Flash or the MBA for the All-
Campus Championship in Intra-
mural Basketball.

Phi Kaps Capture
IF C Swim Title

Splashing its way to three first
place finishes, one in record time,
Phi Kappa Theta captured the
1971 IFC swimming champion-
ships -with Phi Gamma Delta and
Sigma Chi following in second and
third place, respectively.

After winning the 100-yard med-
ley relay in 52.9, the Phi Kaps
took one-two in the 75 yard in-
dividual medley event with the
Murskey brothers leading the Phi
Kap sweep.

However, Phi Gamma Delta
came right back. Fiji (Phi Gam)
George Wenick took first in both
the 50 yard freestyle (24.8) and
50 yard breaststroke (32.0). His
time invthe breaststroke tied‘ the
IFC record.

Skaters, 1 7-3

The Pitt skaters lost their first
match of the season by the scary
score of 17-3 to the semi—profes-

sional Pittsburgh Knights.

The Knights, most of whom have
played together for eight years,
buried inexperienced Pitt goalie
Mark Liberman under an aval-
anche of shots. The line of Bill
Downey and Don and Dickie Riz-
20 each had a hat trick, account-
ing for over half of the Knights
goals.

Scorers for Pitt were Glenn
Hyde, Dave Bahnson and Bill
Glenville. Hyde’s goal was his
fifth in four games.

In addition to the total of 20
goals, there were three fights.
One of them involved Pitt’s Brown
brothers, Kerry and Denny, and
Kerry was ejected from the game.

The Pitt icers, now 2-1-1, take
on Johnstown Sunday at 7:15 p.m.
at the Alpine Ice Chalet. Admis-
sion will be 50¢. The rink is on Me-
Kelvey Road in Braddock Hills.

“I feel that I can do well on the
compulsory part of the competi-
tion,” Beatty said. "And if I do
well on the optional and have a
good day, I think I can place in the
top four."

The top four on the sidehorse
event are John Worthington of
Navy, Tony DeStefano of Syra-
cuse and the pair from Penn
State, Bob Koning and Marshall
Avener.

Beatty will also compete in long
horse vaulting.

This event has no top seeded in-
dividuals. Both Beatty and Coach
Neiger rate this event a toss up
which almost anyone can win.

Sophomore Dick Pribis will also
vault. He will compete in free ex-
ercise too.

“I hope I make the finals this
year,” Pribis remarked. “I fin-
ished 11th as a freshman and
would like to improve my place-
merit.”
