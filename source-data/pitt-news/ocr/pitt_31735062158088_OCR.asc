Student Ideas Vary

On Core Cirriculum

By BERNICE M. COHEN

" Next September the Core Curriculum will be inaugur-
ated on an experimental basis.

The new program will aﬁect

only students in the College at the onset, but is intended
to eventually include all schools in the University.

It will be mainly concerned with integrating freshman",
and sophomore students into university studies and will7

enable them to develop a broader general education.
A Pitt News poll produced varied studentopinions, but
showed that students were interested in the study program

l -Vincent Albo, Med. ’55: I took¢

my undergraduate work at Dart-
mouth where the program was

V in use. It gave me a broader back-

ground in many subjects that I
ordinarily would not have taken.

Phyllis Wolf, Col. ’57: The pro-
gram is excellent for the liberal
arts students and especially for
those who specialize. 4

Bill Welch, Col. ’55: It will be
a definite advantage. to new stu-
dents for it will give them a
broader background when they
graduate.

Adrienne Strathearn, Col. ’56: I
don’t feel that I would have bene-
fited from this program. Students

 should be permitted to specialize

upon their entrance as freshmen.

Robert Weaver, Col. ’57: It’s a
fine plan, but must be ‘modified
for pre-med and engineering stu-

dents..

Darrell Lewis, Col. ’57: Fine
idea for students in The College.

Toby Goldberg, Col. ’58: Re-
quired courses take the tang out

.,of learning. Students should be

required to take only courses in
which they have an interest.
Walter Jaap, Mines ’55: I be-
lieve students should not be forced
to take subjectsthat are not di-
rectly related to their ﬁelds.

think this program should be ap-
plied to all students. In a special-

Dr. Elizabeth Warga Honored
For Research With Light Rays

, By ROSE MARIE SCARPIELLO
It’s not really a “man’s world” when a woman faculty

member of the University of Pittsburgh is able to bring
distinction to the state and country by her outstanding work

in science.

Dr. Mary Elizabeth Warga, professor of physics at Pitt
and one of the few women in the country ‘considered an
authority in applied spectroscopy, will be honored this Sunday

at a buffet supper for three of theé
“1954 Distinguished Daughters of
Pennsylvania.”

Three hundred persons will at-
tend the supper in the Commons
Room which is the first of its kind
in the University. The Duquesne
Club is in charge of the affair
and all expenses are being paid
by Gimbel’s Dept. store.

. _ Colorful Job
.131‘. .Warga received the honor
for her oustanding work in the
ﬁeld of spectroscopy. The study
of light in which it is broken up
into different colors, as in a rain-

bow. .

The woman rphysicist, who per-
haps has the most colorful work
in the University, said she was
“pleasantly shocked” upon hear-
ing of the honor.» *

y Last spring‘, the United States
Air Force asked «Dr. Warga to
travel to Europe to study the
development of upper atmos-’
phere spectroseopy in foreign
laboratories. She‘ visited, the
Vatican Spectroscopy lab in
Rome and also laboratories in
Paris, and Louvain, Brussels,
and Liege in Belgium. A

This was the professor’s second
trip to Europe. She also attended
a spectroscopy conference there
immediately following World War
II. '

. . .  HOW IT STARTED. FRED BIRMINGHAM says: A
“I’ve wanted to be an editor ever since I worked on a boy’s magazine

8. After being an editor of the Dartmouth literary magazine (The Dart),.

‘I set my sights on Esquire. It took 18 years of hard work to achieve

the editorship — after. struggling as a newsmagazine cub, cartoon and
essay writer, advertising copy writer? and trade paper editor.”

  
  
  
  
 

   
 

SUCCESS STORY:
Camels —— America’s most,
popular cigarette . . . by far.’

Pity the poor student, not just here at-Pitt, but.in col-
leges and universities throughout the nation. _He IS eter-
nally besieged on all sides by what he considers unjust

demands upon his time, money, and ability.

He‘ will tell you that each instructor. assigns work as
though his course were the only one on the student’s sched-
ule. Instructors are notorious for demanding assignments
either before or after vacations. .And they refuse to award

‘ “high grades unless the student spends time on the papers.

Fraternity and sorority dues, dances, gasfor the car,
and cigarettes take theirpinevitablye toll on a non-existent
cash reserve thereby calling upon all the student’s ability
as a novelist when he composes the letter to his parents
which claims that he is malnourished,,maltreated, and ma-

ligned due to a lack of treasury notes.

And, of course, there are the myriad fund raising drives

S andcharity campaigns which rain upon his uncut hair every ._

semester. Fortunately for the sanity of the students such

is not the case here at Pitt.

«. There are a number of charitable organizations which
raise funds throughout the country, a portion of said funds
being raised at Pitt. But they don’t solicit individually.
Rather, we have the Pitt Chest, a collective effort designed
to take the impressof several donations from the student’s

_ check book.

A

This ‘year the drive has been modiﬁed, a modiﬁcation

.which will result in Pitt’s retention of "fully two thirds of

all money received to be apportioned among student charity

groups. p
The fact that there is only

one charity drive is justi-

ﬁcation in itself for a sizeable donation. But the beneﬁts
which accrue from the Pitt -Chest drive present an oppor-
tunity which cannot be overlooked. For there is no single
cause which derives all the proceeds. There are ‘a size-
able number of causes, each ofwhich stands as an excel-

lent reason for contributing.

Teachlng Program Paces Buildings . . .

Core Enhances Learning

By Irv Rothman

What the present building pro-
gram is to improved physical fa-
cilities, core curriculum will be
to improved mental faculties.

-And it seems appropriate at this
time that the university sees ﬁt
to liberalize its teaching proce-
dure as it is -
e x p a n d i n g ' 
structural as
sets. /

Core curri-
culum has as
its basis the
integration of
related sub-
jects to estab
lishisome as-
sociation b e r
t w e e n inﬂu-
encing envir-
onmental factors and the material
at hand. We are taught in edu-
‘cation theory classes that the stu-
;dent learns best who can realize
connections between, analagous
subject matter. From our own
experiences, we know thisto be
true. ‘

Man Studies Himself

A study of the humanities as
it has been“ interpreted by the
faculty core committee will in-
tegrate studies in modern liter-
ature, philosophy‘, music, ﬁne

 

 

arts, and religion. It is easy to.

see the relative associations.
Studies will center around the
nature and conditions of man, as
he, himself, has expressed them.

 

Yet, while many students. pres-p
ently take “an interest in litera-
ture or music or philosophy, few

haveifelt the need to combine ,

them. Their powers of“apprecia-
tion are‘ limited to the one phase.’
They miss’ out on the full con-
cept. They think in terms of un-
realisticspeciﬁcs, while a general
understanding would broaden

' their minds and attitudes toward

life’s situations. T
Students Too Limited

This is true of social studies,
communication skills, and espe-
cially so of students engaged in
physical sciences. In courses
where many lab hours are‘ re-
quired to learn how to mix sul-
phuric acid,
leave the modern literature of
contemporary minds or ,don’t
even know ‘names of guberna-
torial candidates.

Dr. Putnam F. Jones, general
coordinator of the core program,
expressed it well last year when

, ﬁnal test, the teacher will make ‘

students tend to .

the .curriculum was ﬁrst intro- ‘J

duced to.Pitt students, ‘when he
said, “chemists can talk to chem-
ists, journalists to journalists, but
there is no common ground.”

He c o n t in ued, “Education.
should be a preparation for liv-
ing.” Core curriculum will de-
velop a broader scope of knowl-
edge in the individual and cer-
tainly a more diversiﬁed one.
And most important of all,

By Cecy Lineoltf

All this recent to-do ‘over the

China has started quite a chain
reaction. . ’

Anyone viewing the Ed Mur-
row program last ,»week certainly
got an eye and earful from the
nation’s college _on the issue.

p The view given by Dartmouth
debate team, captain.Tom Wadell
seemed a most logical one. He

 

said that those students at the
army and Naval academies have
their nation to defend as their
ﬁrst duty. Heyquoted an excerpt
from the speech given by Dwight

‘D. Eisenhower at the 1953 Dart-

mouth commencement ‘on free-
dom of speech in which the Pres-
ident assured the people that they
have the inalienable right to
speak their minds without being
suppressed.

It seems odd that two institu-
tions preaching freedom and pro-
tection of their country wouldn’t
be the first volunteers to speak
_on such a controversial subject.

If the men who are willing to
ﬁght with guns for us .aren’t

. willing to sit down peaceably and .

discuss such national questions in
the best interest of the people,
what good are they?

The Annapolis head said that
our national policy is responsible
for the taboo on the Army—Navy
debate of the question.

Instructors Benefit

‘For the college instructor it
will be *a new experience. Yet it
should provide for him a wel-
come challenge ‘to break away
from a one-course‘ life to extend
his education. Of course, in the

of this university-,~in my opinion, .

is a very high caliber staff. How
many more, students would ben-
eﬁt from their abilities to de-

velop enthusiasm in subject ma-

terial through the new program.
It is signiﬁcant ‘that core cur-

Five Wolverine “Scorers

Show Balanced Attack

By GENE AROMATORIO

One thing that will be in the Panthers favor when they
meet Michigan at Ann Arbor tomorrow night is that the
Wolverines _won’t have a Robin Freeman.

Freeman is the guy7who put the damper on the Panther ,

hopesfor an opening night win by chucking in 42 points to
personally take chargepof Ohio State’s 98-87 win over the
Blue and "Gold the other night. ' »

Although the Wolverines don’t
have any Freemans, they do have
a well-balanced starting five—-
something the Bucks didn’t.

Top Scorers Back
An interesting fact about the

. quintetiis that their starting team

consists of last year’s top -five
scorers, led by 6-0 Jimmy Barron
-——last .winter.’s high pointmaker.

Speaking of things being high,
the Wolverines have 6-8 center
Harvey Williams back for his sec-
ond year and he’s only a junior.

If fans walked away from the
Buckeye game with the impres-
sion that it was all Freeman for
the Bucks, they needn’t_ question
their eyesight--it was. The
slightly-built 5-11 guard was
dunking them in from all over the
floor while the Pittite floormen
were all over his back trying to
stop him’.

Pavlik Sets Mark

There was a Panther eager,
however, Captain.Ed Pavlick, who
nearly matched Freeman point

for point all evening by parting

the cords for 40 points-——good
enough to break a couple of rec-
ords. '

‘bone standard that the Johns-

town Catholic hoopster felled was
the individual Panther
record of 37 points, held by Dodo
Canterna in the 1944-45 season at
the . old Stadium ‘pavilion.

The other mark that was passed

—by both Pavlick and Freeman-— ‘ 51--

was the Field House scoring rec-
ord of 33 tallies, set last year by
Geneva’s Pete Kinkaid.
Ball-Handling Poor

_ Although the first game of the
season, Timmons felt that the
locals played fairly good ball but
he pointed out -a few bad spots

that will need working on. The .

two Panther weakneses that stood
out in his mind were the spotty
ball-handling and the failure of
the big men to get their share of
rebounds. ,

The second-year mentor espe-
cially noted several bad passes
his boys made when they were
trailing ‘73-710 late in the game.
The loose play at this ‘point en-
abled the visitors to cash in with
a trio of field goals andopen a
margin that was too much for the

Panthers to overcome. As Tim-p

mons put “That was our

chance.”

For Hungry Freshmen

After whipping Westinghouse Apprentice, 69-50, Wednes-

day night, the Panther freshmen basketball squad appears’

to be a good bet to make it two in a row tomorrow even-

” ing against Johnstown Center at Johnstown.

- Led by sharpshooting Julius
Peques, the Panther Cubs tossed
in 33 ﬁeld goals in their rout of

(the vocational quintet. Peques, an
import from Tulsa, Oklahoma,

was high scorer wﬁh twenty
points. V \ D ,
The Apprentices jumped to an
early 13-11 lead but eight straight
points on two set shots by Peques,
a jump shot by Phil Kleinman,
and a lay—up by Bill Dillon put
the Pittites in the lead to stay.
High scorer for the Apprentices
was Don Dezort who hit for 14
points. Dezort did most of his
scoring on jump shots from the
foul line. Don Watt was second
‘ior Westinghouse with ten while
the second highest scorer for the

' Panther Frosh was Kleiman with

eleven. -

Coach Carl Peterson was a
little disturbed with his team’s
poor showing from the foul line
since the Frosh hit on only three
foul shots all evening.

Other freshmen besides Peques
and Klieman who stood out in
the 'Apprentice game‘ were sub
Fred Yee who hit six quick points
late in the ﬁrst half, Howie Lester
who put on a second half scoring

Coaching Job. . 0
Still Vacant;
Selection Soon

Who will be Pitt’s next football
coach still remains a mystery, but

' it could be answered in the very

near future. .

The Athletic Committee has had
one meeting to date, and since
Atheletic Director Tom Hamilton
leaves for the Eastern Collegiate
Athletic Conference meetings 1n
New York next Monday night,
they probably will meet again this
weekend. -

In a special meeting last Mon-V

day, the Varsity Lettermen. gave
their representative,_ Dr. Bobby
LaRue, a free hand in selecting
the new coach. These actions all
seem to point to an early choice.
Many candidates have been
mentione for the post, most
prominent of ‘whom are Acting
Coach Hamilton, Backﬁeld Coach
John Michelolsen, Dr.
Baker of Carnegie Tech, Eddie
-Erdelatz, coach of Navy’s Sugar
Bowl team, Biff Glassford, coach
of Nebraska’s Orange Bowlers.
and’ Miami’s Andy Gustafson.
All except Hamilton and Erde-
latz are Pitt graduates.

It may be of little consequence
but the Varsity Lettermen are
known to favor an alumnus as‘ the
new mentor even though they gave
LaRue his choice in voting.

Should the new mentor not be
a member of the present staff.
he will face the pr.oblem.s of
learning the Pitt athletiéiysetup,
and preparing for spring‘ ‘drills.
However, no matter whom’ the
new coach may be, he will in-
herit a fine nucleus for the 1955
season.

It is believed that the commit-
tee wants to pick the new mansas
soon as possible since he will have
to orient himself here and also get
his staff organized.

Panthers Rest
From Big Ten

Big Ten competition is the toughest in the nation is one thought
not many in the Panther athletic family will argue.

No matter what sport. it is, the Midwesterners usually .present
about the strongest teams across the country. In football, the Pan-
thers will readily attest to this and, as at least a temporary respite,
they will not face any Big‘ Teners next year.

The basketballers, however, started oﬁ Wednesday night with
Ohio State and follow with Michigan tomorrow. But after these two
opening contests, they too, get a rest’ from Conference teams and
ﬁnish the season against other strong, but not Big Ten, schools.

Hoop mentor Bob Timmons will certainly welcome this change.
Last semester, in his ﬁrst year as head coach, his squadfdropped
to Michigan State, and Ohio State. This season, his hoopsters lost
to the Buckeyes in the opener Wednesday night‘ and tomorrow even-
ing look for another hard time from the Wolverines at Ann Arbor.

“I just hope they don’t‘ have a Robin Freeman,” was the
coach’s reply_ as to the Michigans. This remark was prompted Just
after the Buckeye star had disappointed ﬁrst nighters at the Field

. House with a shooting exhibition that was close to perfectand had

3700 Veterans Attend Classes

Korean GI’s Swell‘ Enrollment

By GENE

FARKAS

 

Wars seem to come and go with increasing frequency
these days, and so do the men who ﬁght them. This year
Pitt has received a new generation of veteran students, the

second to come along in less

than a decade.

This new tide is the result of the rapid discharge of
men pulled into the armed forces during the Korean emer-

gency. The University's Bureau¢
of Veteran Affairs reports that
the number of students now at-

Korean GI Bill of Rights has
swelled from 1,200 enrolled last
Spring to nearly 2,000 this Fall.
This is in addition to the nearly
1,500 men still using World War
II beneﬁts to further their edu-

Surge Small

This latest surge of veterans is
almost too insigniﬁcant. to be
noticed when compared with the
11,000 veterans of W. W. II who
swarmed to Pitt for the Fall
semester of 1947, the peak year
for veteran attendance in colleges
across the nation. \ .

Current enrollment ﬁgures for
the various university schools
show that the College, with 356,
hasthe largest number of ex-
servicemen in its full-time pro-
gram. In 1947_the number stood
at close to 2500. The School of
Engineering and Mines now has
325 veterans compared to 2,000
in 1947. The School of Business
Administration has 249 full-
timers as against 1500 in 1947.

The ﬁgures also show that out
of the current crop of 2,000
ex-GI’s, 28 are
women and 1,720 are married.

However, to the Veteran Affairs
Bureau, and its secretary, Miss
Marilyn Malin, the few thousand
ex-soldiers: of the Korean emer-
gency mean more work and prob-
lems than the many thousands
more W.W. II men ever did.

Not GI’s Fault

It’s not the fault of the boys,
’Ch0ugh. It’s just the system.
Under Public Law‘ 346, the
Original GI Bill of Rights, every-
thing for the Coming semester is
taken care of at registration. After
he has ﬁlled out the necessary
Papers at registration, all the
W.W. II veteran has to do is to
go to school and wait for the
monthly checks to come in.

The Korean GI bill, known as
Pubhc Law 550, is a different
Story. Under its provisions, in
addition to signing up for bene-
ﬁts at registration, the student
must ﬁll out and turn in to the

now devotes her full time to the
P. L. 550 program, must Pmcess

of each month.

Miss Malin observes that be-
cause the $110 to $160 a month’
provided for under the Korean
bill is hardly enough to get
through college on, most of the
new group of veterans work while
they go to school. She also notes
that the members of this new
group are considerably younger
than their predecessors, and that
because of this, many more of
them will be inclined to join
fraternities then were the older

W.W. II veterans.

WHAT'S THIS DROODLE?

For solution see paragraph below.

, ACCORDING to THE LARGEST and latest coast-to-coast
college survey, college smokers prefer Luckies-and
by a wide margin. The No. 1 reason: Luckies taste
better. Thousands of students appreciate Luckies’
better taste almost as much as the pair in the Droodle
above, titled: Sweethearts attempting ‘to kiss‘ and
enjoy better-tasting Luckies at same time. Luckies
taste better for good reasons. First of all, Lucky
Strike means ﬁne tobacco‘. Then, “I t’s Toasted” to
taste better. This famous Lucky Strike process tones
up Luckies’ light, good-tasting tobacco to make it
taste even better-‘-—cleaner, fresher, smoother. So,

u enjoy the better-tasting cigarette . . . Lucky Strike.
