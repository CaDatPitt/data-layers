Indoor Track Season

A
\/

Six Olsonmen Participate In
‘Meet At.Madison Square
Garden Tomorrow

Coach Carl Olson certainly did not
pick any “breather” to open the Pitt
indoor track season when "he accepted
the invitation to send some of his
select cindermen to participate in the

Millrose Games at Madison.Square
Garden tomor-
row evening. A

Olson and six
of his ablest per-
formers will
leave tonight for
the trip to New
«York where the
year’s biggest in-
door track meet
will be their first
taste of competi-
'tion this season.
Johnny W o o d-
ruff, Art Thomas,
Alex Leggin,
Harold Tost, Ken
Ryden, and Dick
Mason will make

-up the delega-
tion.

Pitt ’ s best
chances lie with
the one-mile re-
lay team which
will run in the
Millrose Mile, the
game’s feature
event. ,

Art Thomas is the anchor man on
that team and he is the runner
around which the team was built.
Thomas is the present holder of the

I Art Thomas

IC4A indoor 60-meter championship,

and was a member of the Pitt mile
team last year, the team which ﬁn-
ished second, and in so doing pushed
Manhattan on to a new meet record.

Lots of Support

Thomas will be ably teannnated.
Johnny Woodruﬁ’, the long-striding

. Olympian, Harold Tost, cross-country

star, and Alex Leggin, another hill
and dale runner, will each take a
quarter mile for their chunk of the
Millrose Mile.

In speaking of sure things (even
though Olson is quite sure that noth-,
ing in this meet is sure), Johnny
Woodruﬁ should not be overlooked.
He is going to run in the 600-meter
event, another Millrose highlight.
Woodruff is the favorite, but his con1--
petition is made up of stern stuff.

Eddie O’Brien, the former Syra~
cuse satellite, will be in the chief
challenging position. As a ma'tter of
fact, he’s in the champion’s shoes, as
he was the winner last year. Charlie
Beetham, Ohio State track captain
who was the only man to beat Wood-
ruff in the Olympic tryouts, but who
missed the boat by a fall, is another
entry. ’

2 Mason To Sprint

Pitt's champion sprinter, Dick Ma-
son, who is the IC4A 200- and 100-
meter champion, will be racing in the
sprints. He’ll be running against Mar-
ty Glickman of Syracuse, who went
to’ Berlin with the team but at the
last minute was not chosen to run.
Ben Johnson of Columbia, Hopkins
of Virginia, and Wuest of Columbia
are also in the sprint running.

Ken Ryden is ‘the other Olsonman
going to the metropolis. He’s a
sophomore hurdler who has been
skimming the timbers in such a con-
vincing manner that he has beaten
out the veteran Andy Lasky. Ryden
will compete in the ,_ 60-meter high
hurdles.

The chief cause for wrinkles in the
Olson brow these days is the fact
that ﬁnal exams have taken his boys
out of the daily practice routine. In-
terrupted in their practice sessions,
the trackmen may not be in their
best shape for Saturday's meet.

Up At The Alleys
With The Greeks. . .

With the ﬁrst semester in its dying
moments, the frat bowling champs of
Leagues A and B, Lambda Chi Alpha
and Sigma Alpha Mu respectively,
clashed to decide upon whose mantle
the ﬁrst place "cup should rest.

The Lambda Chis took second place
last year, and went into the match
the big "favorite. But they lost.

Daniell, Jacobs, and their brothers
looked mighty good as they practi-
cally struck out to beat the Sammies
in the ﬁrst game, 736 to 718. But
Bernie Trumper, SAM president, sud-
denly became smoking hot, and“ fol-
lowing in his shoes, the Sammies
went on to break the three-game rec-
ord and take home the ﬁrst place cup.

Trumper hit 197 in the second
game and 193 in the third to pace
the ﬁeld. For the Lambda Chis,
Daniell, Sprowls and Jacobs were out-
standing. Scores of 748, 744, and
718 gave the SAMs the new record

The general public doesn’t seem to

coaches are the real contact men in

do the‘ position drilling, and handle

Kern was Suthei-land’s chief assist-

Schedule Shows Oddities. . .

A quick glnanceover the schedule
of indoor sports opponents, whom the
Panthers will meet, during February
reveals some startling facts.

Not only will they come up against
suchvaried elements of the nobility
and clergy as’ the Presidents, ‘the
Dukes, 'and_the Bishops, but they
must contest with such nations as the
Irish, the T'a_rtans, and even the
Neivoiiiaiis. _ 1

Going into , more animaliaii clinics,
Panther?-teams must. ﬁght variously
with the Flying Cardinals, the Lions,
thej“Re'd Cats, the Owls, and, not so
animalian but still beastly, the ’_Red
Devils. ' _ _ 

It’s "a good thing we had our inan-
ual handy; we wouldn’t have known
it eit-her.

Fosteriana Collection

Presented University

 

Relics Gathered By Josiah K.

Stephen C. Foster To Be

Lilly From Life, Works Of
Placed In Memorial For

Dedication During Sesquicentemiial

 

The music of Stephen Collins Foster belongs to the world,
but the possessions of the Pittsburgh tragic troubador now

belong to the city of his birth.

Under the supervision of Fletcher Hodges, the famed Lilly

is being“
stored under lock and key in the Ca-
thedral, awaiting the completion of
the Foster Memorial for its ﬁnal lo-
cation. _

Mr. Hodges has been aiding Josiah
K. Lilly of Indianapolis for six years
in gathering the priceless items of the
collection. Thousands of.'dollars have
been expended in collecting the man-
uscripts and rare editions. Mr. I_:111Y,
who presented them to the Univer-
sity, sent Mr. Hodges here to super-
vise their installation. _

Filling half a dozen head-higli see-
tional bookcases in the temporary
Cathedral headquarters, the volumes
containing references to Foster as
well as his personal effects, letters,
phonograph recordings, will be niove_d
to the Memorial in June at its dedi-
cation at the conclusion of the anni-
versary program.

A portrait of Foster by Thomas

poser, was recently donated to the
University by the Andrew W. Mellon
Educational and Charitable Trust,
and will be hung in the Memorial
during the sesquicenteiinial celebra-
tion.

Purchased two years ago by the
Mel1on.Trust, the portrait belonged
to the Thomas C. Clarke collection
of American portraits." The canvas
 .30 by 25 inches, and shows the
c'oinposer in ‘three - quarter length
pose.

Included in the Lilly collection 
the pocketbook Foster carried at his
death and its original contents, 38
cents in coins and “shin plasters.”
The‘ ‘get;-.~p of paper with the words

which--is believed to be the title of’

is also included.

Sik of the rarest items in the col-
lection‘ are manuscripts in Foster's
writing for the lyrics and music of
his compositions. One notebook in
the collection, 220 pages long, con-
tains practically all his drafts for
verses written between 1851 and
1860. '

Foster’s inelodcon, only four and a
half octaves in range, is one of the
valued articles.

Josiah K. Lilly began his collec-
tion in 1930. ‘ Soon he employed two
research workers in the Library of
Congress in Washington and eight
in Indianapolis. In 1934 he decideo
to present the collection to the. Uni-
versity as, Mr. Hodges explains,
“trustee for America.”

The dedication of the Memorial

of Foster, July 4, 1826. He died in
New York City','January 13, 1864..

“About three voyages before, one
night off the South Atlantic coast, it
happened. The helmsman was steer-
ing sleepily, when he heard a voice,
‘Steer east.’ Without turning around,
the helins-inan shifted his course.
tliinking it was the mate who had
spoken.

“In a little while the mate came
up. He wanted to know who had
told the niaiito change the course
‘You,’ said the helnisman. The mate
said he hadn’t. The voice came again,
and this time the helmsman called
the captain. ‘Steer ea..=t,’ the super
'2l2itia‘,Ill.i r-aptaiii said. And that

-A-CHURNING ﬂood had taken out the telephone line
across :1 Colorado stream. Repairmen couldn’t wade
it because of quicksand--couldn’t cross elsewhere and
bring back the line because of obstructions.

Then Kayo’s master had an idea. He went upstream,
crossed, came back and whistled. Kayo jumped in—swani
across with a cord tied to his collar. With this cord, the
wire was soon pulled over-—communication was restored.

A small incident. But it typiﬁes the ingenuity which
helps Bell System men and women to give you the world's
most dependable telephone service.

“Tu Talks
On Change
In   Europe

Authority Discusses Social
Transformation Before
Foreign Policy Body

The dominant factor in Europe to-
day is social transformation, accord-
ing to Raymond Leslie Buell, who ad-
dressed the Pittsburgh chapter of
the Foreign’ Policy Association, of
which he ispresident, last evening.

The new order, Mr. Buell pointed

out, will not be a Communist Utopia;
some form of capitalism will remain
its basis in most countries. But it
will be a capitalism tempered by
state intervention.
_ This social transformation, said‘
Buell, has gone furthest -in the
Scandinavian countries, which have
the highest standard of living in
Europe. In Britain it is taking place
more slowly and is related chieﬂy to
such problems as nutrition and
housing.

“_A, year ago,” Buell continued,
“France seemed to be dying of ane-
mia, but today it is showing dynamic
qualities. The conservatives shout
that recovery is impossible under a
Socialistic prime minister, but recov-
-ery is ‘slowly taking place. .

“The only states in Europe which
are moving rapidly into socialism are
the Fascist states,” Mr. Buell main-
tains. Germany is carrying out many
interesting social experiments, the
effect of which is to diminish class
distinctions. _“Nevertheless, the Nazi
regime will _fail in achieving its so-
cial objectives unless it expands by
force or accepts an international set-
tlement which will meet German
economic needs.

"Unless a constructive political and
economic settlement is soon made be-
tween Germ-any and the out-side
world,” said Buell, “the outbreak of
a general war ‘during the next few
years is not unlikely.”

Reasons why the United States
would ﬁnd it difficult to keep out of
a European war are, says Mr. Buell,
“First, the¢United States is unwill-
ing to abandon its neutral rights or
foreign trade.

“Second, the American belief in
democracy will -give rise to a strong
demand for America’s entrance into
a war against a Fascist opponent.

“T-hird, there is dangersuccessful
Fascist dictatorships may turn greedy
eyes upon the Western Hemisphere.

“The adoption of neutrality legis-
lation which will weaken France and
England in their struggle against the
three world dictatorships will in-
crease pressure within America to
come to the aid of the democracies;
and thus, paradoxically enough, has-
ten our_ entrance into the next war.”

Following Mr. -Buell’s discussion,
an open forum was conducted by Dr.
Albert Wright, dean of the School
of Business Administration at Du-
quesne University, and Dr. B. J.
Hovde, director of the City Depart-
ment of Welfare and associate pro-
fessor of history at the University.

An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women-— lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said
they smoke cigarettes, 87% stated they personally
prefer a light smoke.

Miss Colbert veriﬁes the wisdom of this pref-
erence, and so do other leading artists of the radio,
stage, screen, and opera. Their voices are their
fortunes. That’s why so many of them smoke
Luckies. You, too, can have the throat protection
of Luckies--a light smoke, free of certain harsh
irritants removed by the exclusive process “It’s

Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on the throat!
