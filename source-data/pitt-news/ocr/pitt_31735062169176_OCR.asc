UNIVERSITY   PTSBURGH

Kurtzman Announces

, Creation of Committee

To Study Book Center

by LINDA GOLDSTEIN
(See Ed2'torz'al,~
“The Need to Act”——Page 4)
Chancellor David H. Kurtz-
man has announced the es-
tablishment of a Committee
to Review Policies Regard-
ing the Future Operation of
the University Book Center.
At a recent Pitt News interview,
Dr. Kurtzman disclosed that the
Committee, which is now being
formed, will consist of three ad-

DR. DAVID II. KURTZMAN_
Chancellor of the University.

-m;inistratoI*s, three faculty mem-
bers, and three student repre-
sentatives.

"The purpose of this commi-t-
tee is. to resolve some of the
problems of the policies set up
when the Book Center was ﬁrst
established,” the C-h-an-cellor re-
marked. “We ought to take a
look at Whether there is ju.stiﬁ-
cation for any modiﬁcation of
the present Pblicy.”

Dr. Kurtzman added that the
Committee was formed “in re-
sponse to complaints from both
the students and the faculty. I

think if we are going to take i

something away from the fac-
ulty (-the proposed ﬁve per cent
uniform discount), they ought
to get involved and have an op-
portunity to see the students’
viewpoint. ’

Issues to be discussed by the
Committee include the follow-
ing tiopics: the discount policy;
the number of hours the Book
Center is open; and the policy
on returning books. “Students
are complaining that faculty
members change their minds on
textbooks, for example,” the

-Chancellor stated. He referred '

to the current policy where
books can be returned two weeks
after they are purchased only
if the student has an “add-and
drop slip.

DR. KURTZMAN SPEAKS‘
T0 PROFESSORS
The local chapter of the
American Asssociation of Uni-
versity Professors will hold its
annual meeting at 6:30 p.m.
today in the Student Union
Ballroom. Dr. David H. Kurtz-
man, Chancellor of the Uni-
versity, will speak at the meet-
ing. All faculty members are
requested to attend the meet-
mg.

Another area to be explored
by the Committee is whether
the Book Center is strictly for
the University or should serve a
community function.

The Committee will also eval-
uaste the Monnett-Vrana Agree-
ment, which provided for the
division of Book Center proﬁts
between the University and Stu-
dent Goverment (SG). S»G’s
share was to -be used for stu-
dent activities. “My own feel-
ing is that whatever we decide
to do in place of the Monett-
Vrana Agreement, I don’t be-
lieve in committing yourself be-
cause it’s not going to happen
so soon.” (The Monnett-Vrana
Agrement was made with the
understanding that the Book,
Center _wo-uld not be accruing
proﬁts for several years.)

Men’s Council Sets Draft,
Advisor,Leadershi p Programs

With the Recognition
Committee’s Oct. 2 ultima-
tum to plan elections and de-

_ ﬁne goals as primary busi-

ness, Men’s Council (MC)
met last night. The members
discussed a range of programs
including an upperclass advisor

program for men, a leadership
career conference, and a draft

symposium. MC President Dave
E-hrenwerth said that these pro-
grams and camp-us-wide elec-
tions “wiil make us (MC) rep-
resentative of all men and al-

low us to keep our position as

a major organization.”
Ehrenwerth outlined pro grams

when he p-lans the next Council
will take over. In the middle of

‘Free University’

Students Plan Curricula

A group of students and faculty from the University, Carnegie.
Tech, Duquesne, Chatham, and Mount Mercy is now working on
plans for a "free university” to- be started this fall in the Pittsburgh
area. A free university is an agreement between faculty and stu-
dents toorganize free, --non-credit classes in subjects of common in-
terest which are otherwise not available under existing university

Women Stage Strike
For Housing Rights

by DAN BOOKER
Post on bulletin boards i-n the
girls’ dorms are newspaper arti-

cles describing a hunger strike

by Radcliffe College seniors who
want the right to live off-cam-
pus. For the Pitt girls who may
read these articles, the demands
of the veteran Cliffies are old
hat. Two years /ago, the ﬁrst
break was made here in allow-
ing undergraduate women to
live in partment-s. Rules have
been liberalized until, effective
this fall, any woman with over
30 credits (and parental permis-
sion if under 21) may live off-
‘campus. _ _

- These kind of rules seem far
off for Radcliffe women. Despite
the ﬁve-day hunger strike, it is
unlikely that Radcliffe President
Bunt-ing will‘ give in to the stu.
dent demands. She contends that
the college losses $1,000 each
time a girl moves from college
housing. Radcliffe is already op-
erating at a deﬁcit.

This ﬁnancial factor never en-
tered into discussions of the
problem on this campus. If any-
thing, the situation is reversed.
According to Lorraine Si-bbett,
assistant dean of. women in
charge of housing, the Universi-
ty has a housing problem that
is “quite critical.” This consider-
ation, combined with. the de-
mands of a “certain element,”

said M-iss-Sibbett contributed to
the slackening of off-campus
housing rules, *

Nineteen Radcliffe girls par-
ticipated in the hunger‘ strike.
The method of protest they are
using seems to indicate a gen-
uine interest in living oﬂ’-cam-
pus, but their number makes it
doubtful whether they will win
a victory.‘

At the University, the num-
ber of women wanting to live
C-ff-campus in apartments also
seems relatively small. The num-
ber of each students is increas-
ing, however. In the previous
two terms, 70 women lived in
off-campus housing. An incom-
plete account for next year, com-
piled by the.Dean of Women's
office, shows that 102 women

-will live in apartments next fall.

' The Radcliffe demonstration,
dubbed a “starve-in,” has prompt-
ed ‘the formation of an arbitra-
tion committee to make recom-
mendation on the student de-
mands to the Board of Trustees.
Previously, only Mrs. Bunting
has made recommendations to
the Trustees.

Jacqueline Lindsay, one of the H

coordinators of the hunger strike,
said that she hoped the com-
mittee would become “a perma-
nent part of the decision mak-
ing sturcture at Radcliffe.”

curricula.

Two types of free universities
have sprung up in America
-since 1964. One type is largely
a product of the New Left po-
litical movement, and is there-
fore largely political in its aims.
The second type of free univer-
sity will be the type oﬁered by
the Pittsburgh Free University,
in which there is no political or
intellectual bias.

The ﬁrst free university in

‘Pittsburgh was initiated by stu-

dents and faculty at Mount Mer-
cy College this April. Almost
300 Mount Mercy students par-
ticipated, The University YMCA
conducted a similar experiment
-in Felbrua-ry and March, which
was called “Talk-Ins.”

The goal of the Pittsburgh
Free University is to offer a
broad range of stimulating sub-
jects under informal conditions.
Some of the courses which have
been taught in the free universi-
ties include: the New Left, the
Development of Conservative
Thought, American Negro His-
tory, Contemporary Marriage,
and Radical Theology.

This week faculty members ~

from the ﬁve colleges and uni-
versities are being asked to in-
dicate their interest in teaching
courses at the Pittsburgh Free
University this fall. Any faculty
member or student who would
like to participate in the free
university should send his name
and address and his subject of
interest to Pittsburgh Free Uni-
versity, 4307 Bigelow Blvd., 
burgh 15213.

Med Students

Four medical students from the
University presented award-win
ning papers at the medical
school's Annual Scientiﬁc Day
on Wednesday, May 17. The pro-
gram held at 4 p.m. in the au-
ditorium of Scaife Hall.

ed, MC  conduct a campus-
wide election for the 30 mem-
bers, Eve.ry undergraduate male
will be eligible to vote.

The ﬁrst ‘if the MC programs
to arise will be the traditional
Freshman Orientation Men’s
Host Program. The program
will run through eight summer
orientation sessions. As a new
program, the Co-u-n'cil will set"
up “upperclass advisor groups”
similar to the women’s mentor
grorups. ’

Ehrenwerth believed t h a. t .

such a program would offer a
less formal source of informa-
tion than the Dean of Men’s of-

ﬁce. “Basic questions such as

where things are” could be an-
swered by an upperclassman
that heads an advisor group,
said Ehrenwerth. He noted that
the advisor groups would be or-
ganized at the orientation ses-
sions and the advisors might be
drawn from the orientation
hosts.

He also added that the Fresh-,'

man Council program would be
altered this year. This is a sub-
sidiary of MC which deals with
problems of fresihman men.

Freshmen will «be informed of ’

the Freshman Council program
at the‘""orientartion sessions. Art
the end of September, said Eh-
renwerth, freshman men -will
vote for members of their coun-
cil. Previously, members were
appointed by a special commit-
tee. The members will either be
elected at large or from each
advisor group, E-hrenwertlh
started.

Another program Ehren-werth
stressed was a “leadership ca-
reer conference. He said, “this
will be an annual conference
when we will bring in govern-
ment and business ieaders -to
discuss how students can attain
leadership positions not only

while in school but also in indus- , H

try and government. The con-

ference will be done in conjunc-~

tion with the Placement Serv-
ice, he added and will cater to
junior and senior men.

A draft symposiumwith some-
one like Gen. Lewis Hershey is
another program Ehrenwerth
said was “deﬁnitely needed.”
Freshman Camp and Transfer
programs will continue to be
sponsored by MC.

» Ehrenwerth stressed that this
schedule of programming should
be sufficient to allow MC to re-
tain its “major organization”
staus. The chief advantage of
having such a status is that [it
-allows the president of the or-
ganization to sit in the Student
Affairs Advisory Committee
which meets regularly with the
Dean of Student Alfairs.

of the dull life, her parents, and

She is aware of her body and

*her to the pleasures of sexual
intercourse.‘ She dresses for

bed. Unfortunately, he falls in

marry him after he divorces his
wife. Siv likes sex, but not the

The NeedToAct   7

~Ohancellor'David H. Kurtzman’s decision to establish a Committee
‘to review policies regarding the future operati-on of the University Book
Center is just one more indicatio-n of his personal commitmentto respect
the students’ voice.‘

No one even had to request that such a Committee be formed. Dr.
.Kurtzman took the initiative to move beyond his promise to work for a
ﬁverper cent uniform discount for administrators, faculty, students, and
staff. In response to the stu-dents’ criticism of the Book Center policy late
last term, Dr. Kurtzman felt that the entire operation should be reap-
praised. We applaud him for his move. '

Other administrators W-ould pacify students with satisfying one re-
quest w=hile asking them to sacrifice other equally significant ones; our
Chancellor fortunately doesn’t subscribe to that all too prevalent practice.

Unlike other administrators at this University, Dr. Kurtzman be-
lieves in a straightforward approach. He is not_ one to play power politics
with students, attempting to incorporate them into his idea of what they
s-hould do and what their rights are. His policy of a free exchange of ideas
and sincere respect for the students is one reason for the formation of such
a Committee to explore the students’ dissatisfaction with the present Book
Center policy.

state of the University Book Center for yet another reason. The question
of John Langstaff’s dual capacities as director of Auxiliary Enterprises
(where he is responsible for the operation of the Book Center) and as
owner of Your Campus Store has not been resolved to the best of our
knowledge.

The series of articles which appeared in The Pitt News last term
revealed‘ a. very significant point: Your Campus Store, which is privately
owned by our own Auxiliary Enterprises director, carries items bearing
our University seal which are not available elsewhere. Theseitems are not

- available because of the policy of the Book Center to maintain a certain

“quality” in its whole concept.
The question of conflict of interest has not been dealt with in a satis-

factory manner. This is obviously closely linked with the questionof what --

function our Book Center should provide. We feel that both questions
should be answered as soon as possible and are hopeful that the newly-

. formed committee to review the current Book Center policies will explore
all aspects of this issue.

We are sure that everyone concerned realizes the importance of re-
viewing the entire Book Center question, and not just the more easily re-
solved areas. For only if the Committee has the jurisdiction to thoroughly
investigate the status quo will it be able to make the significant contribu-

Dr. Kurtzman is ‘correct in'his decision to re-evaluate the present

‘Loses’ Auto

Editor, The Pitt News:
I’m sure most Pitt sttidents

-'who’ve ever parked in Schenley

‘Plaza and have been 15 min-

, cu-tes overdue on meter time
.‘ have been greeted with the lit-
. tle "white message, “Mail in $2

or come to Traffic Court in

which case you may ‘qualify’ to
pay $5—if you lose!”
Wednesday afternoon I had
the “privilege” of parking in
oneo-f those nice “safe” spots—
in the back row toward the
Panther Hollow Bridge. About
3:20 p.m. I deposited 25c in the
meter, locked my car, dropped
the keys in my purse and walk-
ed blithely to my class in the
Cathedral of Learning.

If you recall, a hard-driving

"rain started around 4:30 which

continued until sometime after
6:30 p.m. As I came to school
when the sun was shining, I
was not prepared to go out in

V, the storm at the end of class at

5:40, I lingered at the Forbes

,Ave. Entrance for several min-
utes before I decided to “run _

for it.”
Upon approaching the spot

where my car should have-

been parked, there was a black
and white Chevy in my place. I
looked around, thinking maybe

 -_ I was in the wrongarea. Sup- .

pressing the panic that was
desperately trying to overtake

_my being, I ran back to the CL

where I calmly tried to think
what to do.

I looked for a “familiar face”
that might have an umbrella—
called -home to inform my hus-
b-and, “I think our car has ‘been
stolen,” came to conclusion I
would run out and check again

. . same thing—-no car!

I called t'he police and went
through the usual "‘Are you
sure you remember where you
parked?” .  “I’ll connect you

with the ‘Pound’ to see if it was ‘

towed, . etc.”

About 6:55 a policeman pull-
ed in front of the Cathedral, jot-
ted down the information I
gave him and took me (at my
request) to Where I had parked.
To my query, “How often does
this happen?” I was told about
35 cars a day are stolen. I didn’t
pursue this further, which I
should have done to see if this
is in Oakland alone, or the
whole city of Pittsburgh.

I object to meters- that tell '

“would-be” offenders how much

time they have to steal a car

and take a"“joy-ride.” It» takes
an experienced operator to break
into a car—“pop the ignition”
-and take off from a busy area
such as this without being de-
tected.

The police found my car in
the 900 block of Brownsville
Road. They called us at 10:50

Student Cuts
Honors Policy

Editor, The Pitt News:

The women of Tower C have
been left with a seemingly false
impression. They have been al-
most fgorcedto believe that the
Dean of Women’s office does
not want them to have an hon-
ors areathis summer. Or is this
a false ‘impression?

At the beginning of this ses-
sion, ‘the elected floor represen-
tatives from Tower C pursued
a. previousproposal that an hon-
ors area would be set up in that
dorm this summer. The 12th
floor’s response was that it was
“unfeasible.” No explanation
was given other than that the
honors area this pa.st year just
“didn’t work out.” If there was
a way that an honors area, with
few or no rules to be broken,
didn’t work out, I’d like to see
how. ‘

Recently the Dean of Wom-
en’s office granted the wom-
en of Tower C an honors area
for the summer session, but
it has stipulation which many
otherwise qualiﬁed women are
ﬁnding difficult to accept. The
12th floor has deemed it neces-
sary that anyone wishing to be
an honors area student must
move to another ﬂoor, i.e., take

apart a room which they have-

prob-ably just ﬁnished decorat-
ing, move to another room, and
attempt to re—establish the at-
mosphere there. Also, many
girls who have their own phones
will have to go through-the trou-
ble and expense of having them
transferred. Besides they must
again go through c the bother-
some change of address proce-
clure.

Why the move? The 12th ﬂoor
h-as given the superﬁcial reason

that the honors ,area will be run _
A better if all the . girls with no
‘ curfews '

’ t geth 0 - one,

tion so vital to resolving this problem.

feel that the present senior as-
sistants would have a difficult
time keeping track of the girls
«if some had curfews and some
had none, This is actuallyafalse
assumption; since the senior as-
sistants have already gotten to
know the girls on their ﬂoors,
they would have little trouble

. remembering which girls have

honors curfews and which do
not. Actually, this leaves fewer
girls that the senior assistants
would have _to supervise. In-
stead, however, the 12th ﬂoor
has chosen to move all qualiﬁed
girls out of their present rooms
(possibly necessita_ting the writ-
ing of new housing contracts),
and move new students (those
attending only the summer ses-
sionl into them. This act actual-
ly creates even more work for

the senior assistants on the up-_

per ﬂoors, who must get to
know the new girls and acquaint
them with the rules and proce-
dures.

Even though the women of
Tower C should be grateful for
being given a chance to have
an -honors area, it is unfair that
they should have to make an
unnecessary and illogical move,
in order to be granted the favor.
It reflects an unwilling and un-

coperative atitude of the 12th—

ﬂoor toward the women of the
University.

Late Fee Policy

Editor, The Pitt News:

I feel certain that one of the

unfortunate parts of the office

of the Chancellor at Pitt is that
a wide assortment of complaints
and criticisms of all aspects of
the University creep in his mail-
bag. This letter is but another.

The purpose of this letter is
to bring to your attention a par-
ticular policy of Student Rec-
ords that is both illogical and
unfair, I was charged a late fee
of $6 because I registered as
soon as I possibly could for a
course I failed last term. I was
scheduled to graduate, but due

to the last minute failure I had “A,

to register for the ﬁrst seven-
and-a-half week term this Sum-
mer. As was explained in the
Student Records office, if I had
registered in the alloted time
for every course I was carrying
last term and then dropped the
ones that I passed, I would not
have been charged a -late fee.
» In the event that I would
have graduated, then all Iwould
have had to do was drop all the
courses. If Student Records pre-

fers to have the confusion of ..

over 500 cancelled invoices every
term to waving the late fee, then
this is their privilege. The late
$6 fee charged to me is, in their
words, to “help defer the added
cost of processing your registra-
tion,” when in actuality by reg-
istering late a lot of money was
saved for student records.

I intend to do my best to see
that all students who plan to
graduate at the end of this term
register for ever ycourse they
have now, regardless how slight
the chances of them failing the
course they now have.

onfessions ofan Organization Man

Gentlemen:

The six of you have reviewed a wide range of business
issues in these open letters with me this year. Run-
ning through all our dialogue—sometimes stated,
more often‘ imp|icit—have been these two basic ques-
tions: 1. What turns a man on? 2. What is a life for?

Whether we were discussing specific management
training programs or the general responsibility of _
business for the welfare of mankind, we seldom
strayed far from what it is that really gets one particu-
lar individual engrossed, what he wants his life to
count for, where he will find his greateststrengths and
fullest meaning, and where he wants the world to_ go.

We agreed at the start that students could under-
stand business better and that business could better
understand students. We divided students into two
groups: men who eventuallywould enter business,
and men who would not. We hoped that the men
whom business would ”turn on” would not stay out
of business for the wrong reasons; we hoped that
men attracted to other occupations would under-
stand what had ”turned on” the first group.

We felt that fuller awareness of what business is and
what its actual and possible social roles are would
interest both these groups——the menwho would
carry out the roles, and the men who would.observe
and judge from outside. *

Your questions and comments this year have been
constantly thoughtful, often appreciative, occasion-
ally misinformed, a few times barbed. To judge by the
numbersof businessmen who have asked for reprints,
I shall not be the only one to profit from your

candor and your thinking.

Most of these other businessmen would agree that,
given today's range and variety of businesses and
businessmen, you probably could find a company or
an executive somewhere to justify even the most
disdainful of your comments. We would suggest,
however, that the great majority of companies and
businessmen do not-fit your most baleful stereotypes
——and you might wish to avoid the ones which do.
Unless, that is, you wished to join themwith
”reform” consciously in mind.

Which brings me to a point I hope you will consider
during this coming summer: The ”organization,” as
a central structuring of society, seems to be here

to stay for as far into the future as we now can see.

It is not a perfect structure but, especially with seven
billion people expected on earth by 2000 A.D., there
just does not seem any better way to operate. Like
all structures, moreover, the ”organization” is

most readily improved from within.

   

 

The organization has replaced the tribe, guild,

order, and economic dukedom. It is no longer rele-
vant to yearn fora Walden Pond or a family farm type
of economy—or for a worldlwhere sons inevitably
followed fathers down into the same mine.

What is relevant is to closely study the organization
wherever we find it—in business, government,
teaching, law, or medicine—to detect and_ correct
its weaknesses, note the increased freedoms it gives
us, evaluate the powers it is acquiring, and decide
what goals we want those powers directed toward.

. As we do this, we shall see with increasing clarity

that it is people who direct the organization.
Like the computer, the organization must be the
servant, not the master, of men.

l .
No organization, whether it be The Halls of lvy

A or the Executive Suite, is the stultifying, suffocating,

soul—destroying monster it has at times been painted
—except"to the degree it falls short of its special "
genius. That ”organization man” whose image

you find so repellent is a man who takes root

where the organization is failing its mission.

The special genius of the organization has several
features which should appeal to men of your calibre
and predilections. Each of the four points I mention
here is a goal toward which wise leadership aims.
Each_ can challenge youth.

1. The organization is aimed at the future. it is formed
to fill a future need; its officials are elected to
guide itsfuture progress; its most vital problems
are those which affect its future. You are oriented
toward the future, too.

2. The organization model is flexible and responsible.
You can see this in business when you thought-
fully read the financial news: A merger occurs
when changing conditions and changing needs call
for changing structures; new goals must be es-
tablished to satisfy new demands; new tal-
ents are required to accomplish
these goals; a new business
activity relates to new social
needs. You also prize flexibility,
the exercise of talent, social contri-
bution and involvement.

3. The organization does not demand total commit-
ment. An organization is an instrument for the
accomplishing of a certain set of a man's total
goals. When it begins to become the sum total of
life, it departs from its model, wastes its talents,
and can lose its talented men. You value freedom
now; you may soon come to appreciate
structure as well. 3

   
   

4. The organization is designed for, aimed at, and
directed by flesh-and~blood men and women.
Neither the gray-flannel man nor the beatnik can
have a real hand or final voice in the health or the
direction of such a structure because neither has
matured to its challenges. All participate to the
extent of individual capabilities. '

If a student has true and deeply rooted convictions
as to where he wants his life to take him and where
the world should be going, it behooves him to direct
his talents and energies toward these goals. He will
do this most effectively by becoming involved in
one of the several major moving forces or organiza-
tions in today's society. Business is one of these.

for discussion. These open letters between a
businessman and six different students are coming
to a halt for this semester year. But the thinking of
businessmen about students and the thinking of
students about business will not stop for the summer.

have appeared, there are 4°"

RECRUITING’S THE NAME or THE CAME..

;_ Those people who attended last month’s Spring foot-
 ball game probably paid more attention to what happened
' at halftime than to the game itself. And who could blame

_ Dave Hart used the intermission to introduce most of

- the 4 players he and his staff had recruited for next season's
'~ freshman team.-Lloyd Weston was there. The crowd knew-I .
all about his prowess on the gridiron. They also knew that
7 .Hart had outfought virtualy every collegiate football power

There were others on the field that Hart had Won over
in high-pressure recruiting battles, perhapsnot as publi-
fc_'ized, but just as intense as the Weston affair.

 .ONE OF THOSE involved Dave Garnett, a‘ 6-3, 210‘ lb.
a split end from.Buffalo. Garnett had run the hundred yard
;__,-dash the year before in 9.5 seconds, the N.Y. State high
'1 school- record. Pitt had never had anybody with Garnett’s
[speed before. And Hart had s-old -him on Pitt.

" ‘ Or so Hartthought that April afternoon. When the
daycame last Wednesday for the national letters of intent
to become official, Garnett’s letter hadn’t arrived. , 4
Several colleges had been to see Garnett and his parents
du.-rng the interim. Reportedly, an Eastern school had told
-the Garnetts that Dave.wasn’t qualified to enter Pitt’s.phar-
rnacy school and had suggested that he become a teacher in-
stead. The school in question doesn’t offer pharmacy.

7 ‘Hart didn’t give up. He arrange to have Garnett’s
parents fly down for the weekend .to see Pitt for the first
-time. On hand to meet them, in addition to the entire Pitt
coaching staff, were Dean Bianculli of the School of Phar-
 -macy; a local Negro pharmacist whose son went to Pitt
pharmacy; and Lloyd \7Veston, among others.

.. . WESTON INCIDENTALLY, had called Garnett sev-
_ eral times long distance to try to resolve his confusion. In
5 addition,“ Garnett hadreceived calls from Marty Schotten-
heimer, a former Pitt great,
 Bills, and Van Miller, a Buffalo sportscaster, whom Hart
' terms “‘the Bob Prince of Buffalo.”

,_ One of the new assistant coaches, Stan Zajdel, had
known Miller in Buffalo, and Hart just last Friday asked

Miller to put in a good word for Pitt.
' . Apparently Garnetts’ parents were impressed with
 what they saw here, and Garnett himself 'had made up his »
ttmind. Hart flew back to‘ Buffalo with them Sun-day and
Garnett signed the letter of intent Sun-da,y night.

 __ HART NOW HAS 32 of the original 34 coming here in
' ..the fall. He -hopes to commit Mike Connell, the 9.7 sprinter
from N.Y., sometime this week. But Rick Lewis, a Penn-
sylvania. quarterback, has been given an appointment to
a West Point which he probably won’t turn down.

"i But even without Lewis, this fall’s freshman team
promises to be the finest in Panther history. Credit that to

hit the ball solid it went right

, The one solid hit off of Welty
went for an out but it scored
the winning run as State won
the opener, 3-2.

Earlier the Nittany Lions had
ended Welty’-s scoreless streak
after 44% innings by _scoring
two runs in the sixth inning on
an inﬁeld hit, a walk and a
bloop single. That tied the game,
as the Panthers had scored sin-

innings.

In the seventh, State loaded

Welty got. the ball down low
again in the eighth, but the mit-
ters couldn’rt push over a run
against relief pitcher Phil Wil-
liams, and Welty suffered his
ﬁrst loss in six decisions.

His performance, however, was
enough to have Penn State coach
Chuck Medlar called him, “The

‘ best pitcher we've faced up here

in ten yeans.”
According to Lewis, the first

game was the key. “-Both teams-

were so keyed up that -the mo-
mentum carried over. If we had
won the ﬁrst one, we’d have
swept.”

Don Stock only allowed six
«hits in the nightcap, but State’-s
Jim Allgyer limited the mitters
-to three in the seven imiing
game, An error opened the way
for two unearned runs in the
fourth, and State went on to,
score a 3-Ovictory.

“AlIgyer’s tough,” said Lewis,
“he has a real good dueoe-( curve
ball). He keeps it right down
on the plate where you can't do
anything with it. But,” he added,
“we were down.”

Penn State received a bid to the
NCAA touranment along with
Rider, Ithaca and St. J ohn’s.

Before the meet, Banner ﬁ'g-

ured out that some of his run- v

ners would appear in three and
four races. Penn ‘State, however,
always entered a freshman in
every event. Most of_ the other
competitors were forced to dou-
ble-up, what with trials and ﬁ-
nals.

now. “We’re building,” said Ban-
ner, who is climaxing a gigantic
recruiting program. He says,
“wait two years, then Watch.”
