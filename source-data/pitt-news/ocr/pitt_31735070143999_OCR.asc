Marquardt
talks TV,

V Playboy

by Liz Williamson
Staﬂ Wrder

Searching for an idea for a Hal-

 loween costume?

TV personality Bridget Mar-

 quardt has a few suggestions.

A sexy, deranged clown. A mer-

1 maid bitten by a shark. A spacegirl
 ; Or Lily Munster in a short, hemmed
, dress.

Marquardt, 35, a cast member

 in the reality television show “The
 Girls Next Door,” spoke m the Wil~
‘ liam Pitt Union last night in an event
A hosted by the Pitt Program Council.
 Justin Jacobs of the Pitt News led
V  the conversation with Marquardt;

As a little  Marquardt said
she used to sneak peeks at her dad’s
Playboy magazines.

“I would think, ‘Those girls
are so beautiful,’ and. that’s how I
formed my standard of beauty,”
said Marquardt, who was visiting a
college campus as a guest speaker
for the ﬁrst time.

When she was 17, Marquardt
wrote a letter to Playboy to inquire
as to how to become a Bunny.

The letter was returned to send-
-er. P

“Maybe I was underage,” she
said

Marquardt, originally from the

town of Lodi, Calif., received a bach-
elor’s in communications from Cali-
fornia State University, Sacramento,
and‘ worked as a medical assistant;

Her favorite college memory, she
said, revolves around one particular
course in public relations.

“I hit it off with one of my pro-
fessors, and he inspired me to get a
graduate degree,” she said.

But one day, she received an issue
of Playboy in the mail as a joke from
one of her friends.

Coincidentally, perhaps, she
came across a casting call to test for
the Millennium Playmate

She grabbed her swimsuit and
heelsand headed to San Francisco

The black community is being infected
from within. h

Or so says rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs
in a YouTube video.

On Monday night, the members of. the
Black Action Society gathered in their first
general body meeting to try to deﬁne “bit-
chassness,” which Combs describes in one
of his videos as a sickness infecting the
black community. — ‘ .

Neither the panelists nor the audienc
members came up with a single deﬁnition
for “bitchassness.” ' i

“It is someone who is not being straight-
forward,” said one panelist. Others , said
it was “trying to be someone you’re not”
or “someone that brings someone else
down.”

opinions; san Francisco puts the J 0 Arts and Entertainment: Warhol screen

tests make‘ world premiere.

The moderators, Black Action Society ,
. members Keith Green and Ashley War-

ren, presented slides highlighting potential
examples of “bitchassness” to audience
members and eight society members, who
comprised a panel debating the term.
Audience members received signs read-

ing “I00”/o B*TCH@$$NE$$” or “NO _

B*TCH@$$NE$$” when they walked into
the William Pitt Union’s packed Assembly
Room. They held up their signs after each
scenario so that they too could participate
in the discussion. --

Each scenario stirred up a debate.

One of the scenarios was a “jump—i_n,”
in which two people have a conﬂict and
one person decides to retaliate with a group
instead of just one-on-one.

The panel and the audience disagreed as
to whether this was considered “bitchass—
ness.”‘Some people said that others should

stick up for their friends because of loyalty,
while others said they believe a disagree-
ment should be handled “mano a mano.”
Other topics discussed included “act-'
ing hood,” when students come to Pitt and
pretend to be from the inner city; handling
rejection; and two-timing, when people
date more then one person at a time.
Another issue was snitching, "which. a

slide described as a “codeiof conduct in the _

black community.” S
Green and Warren showed a clip of a

"60 Minutes" interview with rapper Cam- -

eron “Cam_’ron” Giles, who was shot at
least twice while he was visiting Washing-
ton, D.C., in 2005 for Howard University’s

homecoming. Giles ‘said in the interview

that he didn’t know who shot him but that
even if he did, he was raised not to tell on
other people and thus wouldn’t tell the po-
lice.

. The classiﬁed ads for Wednesday,
‘ Oct. 22, 2008. ’

Overall, audience members and panel-
ists seemed to agree that not snitching is
“bitchassness,” but many.said that snitch-
ing applies to all walks of life, not just gang-
sters. '

“Snitch on yourself and others,” said
one woman standing in the back of the
packed room. “If you are going to snitch,
make it 100 percent, not 50 or 75 percent.”

At the end of the event, the forum
turned into a discussion about domestic
violence.

Green and Warren presented a slide
titled “Love is a two-way street,” and meet-
ing attendees debated whether it was “bit—
chassness” if a woman retaliates after a
man hits her. V

All the panelists agreed that men hitting
women was not acceptable. However, some
male panelists warned. women not to pro-
voke men, especially if they have a history

Marquard Calls Hefner

Ben Filio / Assistant Photo Editor

Vt7hen she's not posing for Playboy or
ﬁlming her El reality show "Girls Next
Door," Bridgette Marquardt likes to speak
in the WPU Assembly Room.

for a Polaroid shoot

While she was waiting to be-
gin the shoot,_a photographer in-
formed her that he would ask her
to take her top off ,

“It never occurred to me,”
Marquardt said.

But she went through with it
And her shoot was a success.

She received a call at the medi-
cal ofﬁce. ‘

The magazine had invited her
to stay at the Playboy Mansion for
three days.

I “I was nervous and excite ,”
she said. “It was so much fun.”

Marquardt waited for 18
months, however, before 
out that she wasn’t selected as the
Millennium Playmate. I

“I was devastated,” she said.

mquardt went on to ﬁnish
her education and graduate from

the University of the Paciﬁc with ’

a master’s in communication.
“When I graduated, I had
to make a decision,”'she said. “I
could either give  a Play-
mate] a second try or get a real job

' and a career.”

She went with the second try.

Marquardt took her savings
and moved to Los Angeles to
purse her dream of becoming a
Playmate. '

_ She went to  in the Sun on
Sundays, dinner and movies on
the weekends and parties at the
Playboy Mansion until one day,
when the magazine’s editor—in—
chief Hugh Hefner, 82, called to
ask her to go on a date with him
and the girls. -

“Hef is a gentleman and very
traditional,” said Marquardt

She turned down his invita-
tion. _

“I just wanted to be a Play-
mate,” she said.

A couple of months later, she
gave in and went out with Hefner
and his 12 girlfriends.

Shortlythereafter, she moved

into the Playboy Mansion.
That was seven years" ago.

A call from a friend
Marquardt called Hefner on

speakerphone at 9 p.m., which
was 6 p.m. on the West Coast,
right before his cup of Soup.

After the two briefly caught
up, they said their goodbyes.

“I love you, baby,” said Hef-
fner.

“Now you can all say that you
were on the phone with Hugh
Heffner,” said Marquardt.

The ten other girlfriends left

quardt, Holly Madison and Kend-
ra Wilkinson —- formed a family.

“We were thrown into the
press, into celebrityism,” said Mar-

” quardt. “We were just the blonde

girls. No one knew our names or
asked us anything.” _

That experience, formed the
basis of the bond among the girls,
she said.

“The show doesn’t show how
deep our friendship is,” said Mar-
quardt.

"There is no typical day—in—
the—life,” She said.

On top of photo shoots, press
conferences and interviews, “The
Girls Next Door” ﬁlms twelve
hours per day, ﬁve daysiper week,
she said.

“The cameramen knock on
our doors to wake us up in the

morning and ﬁlm us as we change A

into pajamas and brush our teeth

before bed,” said Marquardt.
The show is ﬁnishing 

its ﬁlth season and might ﬁlm a

sixth. .
Meanwhile, Marquardt “is liv-
ing her dream of hosting her own

television show.

She  started  her
own show for the Travel Chan-
nel, “Bridget’s Sexiest Beaches,”

which will airin March 2009.

“Follow your dreams,” said
Marquardt. “I was told ‘no’ the

again. Finish your education, and

Students give grades to

presidential

by Nicole McIntyre
Staff Write/‘

If it were up to students, presidential candi-
date Barack Obama would make the dean’s list;
His opponent, John McCain, would fall sho
according to a report. 

The Presidential Report Card, a project
run by the United Press International news
service, allows 'college—aged voters to grade
the candidates based on their stances on abor-
tion; immigration; the economy; lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transgender issues; education;
Iraq and Iran; health care; and energy and the
environment

Young voters are able to read a short de—
scription on where each candidate stands and
then assign him a grade on an A to F scale.

Obama received a 3.63 grade point average,

W " . while McCain got a 3.31.

Nicholas Chiaia, the president of United
Press International; said in a news release that

candidates

he thinks the candidates can benefit from the
report card because it “show[s] them how they

' are doing” with young voters.

Pitt student Julie Stampﬂe said she agreed
with the grades.

“I deﬁnitely think the ‘grades are a pro-
jection of what the election will hold,” said
Stampﬂe. “The way students grade the candi-
dates directly reﬂects how they feel.”

The report card is part of a news feature
called “The Voice of Young Voters,” which
hit United Press Internationals Web site last
month.

College students can submit articles to the
Web site.

“We want young voters to know that their
voice and their vote counts,” said Chiaia. “The
stories submitted by students give our nation
a valuable insight into the concerns of young
Americans. -

San Francisco prostitutes
could be off the hook

Decriminalized prostitution has
costs and beneﬁts ‘

If the proponents of San

iFrancisco’s Proposition K get

 their way, prostitutes might soon
1 be able to walk the city’s streets
1 freely. The measure aims to for-
 bid local authorities from inves-
v tigating, arresting or prosecuting
: people for selling sex, according
 to an article published by the
 Associated Press yesterday.

I The measure does not fully
Elegalize prostitution, as it’s still
 prohibited by California law. But
i it would effectively decriminalize
3 the activity by making it impos-
Eivsible for authorities to enforce

i the law in the city.
' Prostitution is legal in other
5 cities and countries around

 the world. For instance, in the
0  Netherlands all sex workers are

 licensed and can join unions, pay

. income taxes and are allowed to

- take part in many health and so-

, cial services.

: Brothels are legal in some

vrural counties in Nevada, and
v Rhode Island allows consenting
adults to exchange money for
sex behind closed doors.

The difference between these
measures and Proposition K is
jthe level of regulation, which
is not a provision in the San
Francisco measure. The initia-
tive would simply decriminalize
prostitution across the board,
lwhich could only increase the

i  problems facing prostitutes cur-

5 rently. .

_ If the people of San Fran-
 cisco pass Proposition K, they
5 need to be sure to‘ pass accom-

that the industry they endorse
doesn’t run amok in the after-
math. Regulating prostitution is
the only viable way to legalize
the activity; otherwise, the dan-
gers to women and the nega-
tive social aspects could be too

great.

panying regulation to make sure ,

Francisco does regulate the sex 
industry, it could be a boon for 
those who work in it. The pros— 
pect of safe, legalized working 
environments and the ability to 3
‘report abuse or bad behavior

on the part of a client could
eliminate many of the problems
prostitutes face, such as aggres-
sive pimping and substance
abuse.

Proposition K is obviously a
controversial measure, and there
are a large number of unknown

aspects to the legislation. For ex- I

ample, some people oppose the
measure based on the idea that
decriminalizing prostitution will

increase the rate at which peo- -

ple take part in it, as well as the
number of prostitutes on the
streets. '

Other opposition, criticizes

the lack of accompanying regu—'

lation and the idea that_ it might
empower pimps and human
trafﬁckers because they would

not have to fear retribution from 

the police.

It is evident that there are 

problems with Proposition K as

it currently stands, and that oth- 3
er cities or states would probably 

be remiss in proposing similar
legislation. However, the con-
cept of decriminalization could
potentially help sex workers if
it’s accompanied by -regulation
and licensing.

The idea of prostitution is a
difficult moral issue for many
people, especially when -con-
sidering aspects such as sexual
slavery and drug addiction. But
judging from the records of
other countries and states where
forms of prostitution have been
decriminalized, regulation is a
better alternative than illegal ‘ac-
tivity in nearly all cases. Proposi-
tion K doesn’t provide for that
regulation, but it is'a step in that
direction.

SGB iswrong for d

    
 

Cola/n/uitt

I had always thought that Stu-
dent Government Board had no

impact on my daily life. This isn’t
meant as a criticism of SGB.
Until a few weeks -ago, I’d just
considered it to be a collection
of students with a penchant for
playing at government and an in-
comprehensible fetish for fiber-
glass cats. I .

But my opinion of SGB
changed for the better when,
back in September, SGB agreed
to release $17,500 to fund for-
mer vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferra"ro’s-_visit to Pitt.

By partnering with the Col-

lege Democrats to bring Ferraro

to our campus, S.GB demonstrat-
ed its ability to affect student

-life positivelyiand to contribute

to the education of students as
they prepare to vote in this year’s
presidential election.
SGB’became relevant to me
and many other. students on
campus when they approved this
funding. Saying that I was proud
of SGB would be an overstate-
ment, but I no longer considered
it to be inconsequential, and so I

started paying more attention to ‘
its weekly meetings.

Then, last week, SGB dashed
my newfound faith in its com-i
petence and- usefulness when it

,denied the College Democrats
access to this funding when it
tried to bring Democratic strate-
gist Donna Brazile to Pitt. _

Ferraro had to cancel her trip
to our campus for personal health
reasons. The College Democrats
sought to use the $17,500 allo-
cated to them by SGB to bring
in a new speaker. The executive
board of the College Demo-
crats decided on Donna Brazile,
who has played a leading role in
American politics over the last
two decades.

She was instrumental in the;
campaign to make Martin Lu-
ther King]r.’s birthday a national
holiday and served as Al Gore’s
campaign manager in 2000. Bra-
zile has taught at Harvard and
Georgetown and today is con-
sidered a leading expert on presi-
dential politics. ’

In short, Braz_ile’s experience
makes her the ideal speaker to

educate Pitt students about the .

electoral process as they prepare
to vote in two weeks.
But rather than work with

MCT Campus

enying funding

the College Democrats to bring
this speaker to Pitt, SGB, led by
board member Perry Servedio,
refused the group’s application
for a budget modiﬁcation and
effectively prevented the student
organization from bringing Bra-
zile to Pitt. '

But SGB didn’t stop there. -

Servedio read a prepared state-
ment at last Tuesday’s meeting

in which he called the College

Democrats unorganized and ac-
cused their leadership of being
incompetent. Servedio “also said
that he was offended that the

group -sent out an e-mailito its‘

members outlininghow he and

other members had voted during’ .

the Sept. 16' decision to fund the
Ferraro‘ event,” as reported‘ in
The Pitt News.

When I read this, I decided,
I had to look into it further. I’

called both_Servedio and Lissa
Geiger, the president of College
Democrats, so that I could hear
both sides of this issue. Geiger
returned my phone calls; Serve-
dio’ did not.

Geiger said that, contrary

to Servedio’s allegations, the
College Democrats had made

the" appropriate arrangements ,0

to host Brazile, including the

McCain's campaign is based on creating fear  

by Matthew Diabes

Columniat

I thought it couldn’t get any
worse. But as I’ve observed the
presidential campaigns, I’ve learned
never to say that again. '

I watched the ﬁnal debate be-
tween Sen. john McCain and Sen.
Barack Obama on CNN last week,
and I thought it would be full of
more cool, mildly boring discourse
that had the occasional comic relief
of a “Joe Six—Pa ” here and a “drill,
baby, drill” there. I was wrong: It
was “Joe the Plumber,” and the dis-
course wasn’t cool or mildly boring.

The American presidential de-
bate is no longer "a forum to learn
about candidates and their policies;
rather, it is the space in which we
watch the foul play of a Democrat
and a Republican as we try to make
sense of whose smears are actually
grounded in truth.

During the debate, McCain
vaguely referenced attack ads that
the Obama campaign had run, say-

reservation of a room for her

speech. She said that the College '

Democrats, are working with the
Obama campaign to bring in a
surrogate to speak ‘to students
now that SGB has denied them
funding for Brazile’s visit.

I worry that Servedio’s, re-
marks and SGB’s vote against
funding for Brazile’s visit will
prevent the two organizations
from cooperating "in the future
as they were prepared to do back
in September when trying to

ing they inaccurately represented
his positions on  stem—cell
research and immigration. He went
on to claim that Obama has spent
more money on negative campaign
ads than any other candidate in
American history. During the ‘de-
bate, he also commented on T—shirts
that were present at an Obama rally

that were “unacceptable.” McCain
then said, “Every time .there’s been
an out—of—bounds remark made by
a Republican, no matter where they
are, I have repudiated them.”

"Our opponent  is someone
who sees America, it seems, as being
so imperfect, imperfect enough, that
he’s palling around with terrorists
who would target their own coun-
try,” said Gov Sarah Palin, McCain’s
running mate, at an Oct. 4'rally in

Colorado. Her statement was not

repudiated. But Palin is not simply-

a “Republican” or a person at a rally
or a slogan on a T—shirt'or poster.
She’s McCain’s  mate, sec-
ond in line to command the United
States if his smears scare enough
people and he wins.

 rallies where Palin ~

SGB should play positive role _

bring Ferraro to Pitt.

SGB can play a positive role
in student life if it decides to
promote discourse on campus
and bring in speakers to educate
students about the issues of our
time.

Someone has to take leader-
ship in doing this: The Pitt Pro-
gram Council, which has brought
us Mo Rocca and a Playboy bun-
ny this semester, has completely
dropped the baH already.

But SGB can’_t do anything if

was present, Obama said during the
debate, “All the public reports indi-
cated [supporters] were shouting,
when my name came up, things
like ‘terrorist’ and ‘kill him,’ and that
your  mate didn’t mention,
didn’t stop, didn’t say, ‘Hold on a
second, that’s kind of out of line.’”
In response, McCain said, “\When-
ever you get a large rally  you’re
going to have some fringe peoples.”
I thought I had a low opinion of
Palin butapparently she is nothing
more than a “fringe person” at her
own rallies. '
Obama commented during the
debate that Americans are becom-
ing “cynical” about politics. That

is the greatest understatement of

the century. People aren’t cyni-
cal + they outwardly hate politics.
The debates have become some-

thing painful to watch, and no one.

feels as good as they want to when
they cast a vote because it is always

ﬂipped from “who I want as my

president” to “who I mind the least
as my president” No wonder so few
Americansvvote! Between an alleged
terrorist and his ever-smiling run-

it doesn’t have a positive work-
ing relationship with student
organizations like the College
Democrats. For this reason, SGB
should ofﬁcially refute Servedio’s
comments alleging disorganiza-
tion and incompetence on the

part of the College Democrats '

leadership. Such personal attacks
on campus leaders have no place
in the official business of our
student government.

ning mate, and a senile, grumpy old
man and his lunatic pet from Alaska,
I’ve become disillusioned with poli-
tics as well.

I used to be excited to voice my
opinion, to have a part in a decision
that affects the entire world. Barack
Obama is still clearly the ~ cleaner
‘candidate. I-Iis so-called negative

-once has he challenged the McCain

campaigns claim that McCain is a

' “hero” or an “honorable POW.”

During the debate, McCain

f misrepresented Obama, saying he

meant to raise taxes on “Joe the
Plurnber” ‘and to spread his wealth
to other people. He failed to men-
tion that “Joe the Plumber” would
be  more than $250,000 per
year if his taxes would be raised un-
der an O_bama administration. But
of course, who has time for facts
these days? ’ 0
McCain is an old dog, and you
can’t teach an old dog new tricks. He

posite of what the people need, he
has chosen to appeal to their fears.
For McCain, it’s about what can win
rather than what’s right

I used to think McCain was re-
spectable, but even after Obama
clarified his connections to Bill Ay-
ers and ACORN and the topic had»

_ beensettled during the final debate,

McCain persisted by quoting a com-
ment by Bill Ayers and retorted that
Obama’s ties needed further inves-
tigation. He said, ‘The American
people will make a judgment.” Then,
he quickly sobered and said that his

_ campaign is about a “brighter future

for America” Brighter doesn’t typi-
cally describe a future in which the
public is manipulated by lies and
rhetoric and pumped full of base-
less fears.

McCain -is out of ammo, so now
he’s pointing his empty gun at the
American people. He doesn’t want
peoplento think “Who will be best
for me?” or “Who will be best for

my children?” He wants ‘fear. Vote:

McCain or die.

"Andy'Warhol is the only genius I've ever

known  an IQ of 60."

- Gore Vidal

 

Pitt professor Sean Derry's inﬂatable cars are made of old bed sheets  latex. Onlookers observe the colorful cars  they overtake a parking lot in Braddock.

'Stillness' turns heads

by Colleen Counihan
Staﬂ IV/'iter

Interlude to Stillness

Sean Deny
Oct. 22 to 25
Braddock Avenue

What happens when one combines old
bed sheets, a coating‘ of latex, a good motor

scooter air pump and an empty  lot?‘

For Sean Derry, a Pitt sculpture professor, the
answer is simple: Art happens

From today until Friday on the 300 block
of Braddock Avenue, Derry will be displaying
what he deemed “An Interlude to Stillness”

Using an abandoned  lot as his
backdrop and the use of homemade air
pumps, he will inﬂate 30 multi-colored auto-

mobiles made from recycled bed sheets in the

parking spaces of the lot. _
“Ultimately you want people to see it,”

explained Derry. “The primary viewers are
people moving around the city on a regular
basis —— I want people to just happen onto
this, maybe  to work, maybe just walk-
ing around.”

Though visibility is important to him as
the creator and planner of the installation, the
meaning behind it is just as important. Derry
said he wants people to not only see the col-
orful  lot, but to think about its con-'

trast to the lots appearance before and what
this means for the surrounding area.

“It’s really more about  the question
and stepping into the process, and the ques-
tion is: What are the impacts of these spaces
that are empty’ and still, and how, as a com-
munity, do we deal with them, and is there a
potential to change them?” said Derry.

. But Braddock is not Derry’s first version
of “Stillness” He initiated the project while
 in the Midwest, and after the destruc-
tion of Hurricane Katrina, he decided to set
up the installation in a New Orleans neigh-
borhood where many locations had been
forcibly abandoned. ' " ‘

“One  that was incredible about New

Orleans was how much the ordinary citizen '

understood that these spaces had a potent
impact on their daily life, and they responded
to someone to do something in those
spaces,” he said.

The process of setting up the cars is not a
simple one. Derry spent about one year cut-
ting out patterns and sewing them together.
He constructed pumps in the form of auto
engines that will be controlled by motor
scooters to inﬂate the cars. This will need to

be done about every 45 minutes during the‘

showing.

An example of the car, one of the pumps
and a motor scooter will be out for  at
the University of Pittsburgh Department at

Live music will combine with Andy War-
hol’s pop—art ﬁlms this Friday at the Byham
Theater. _

To conclude The Pittsburgh Internation-
al Festival of Firsts, Pittsburgh will set the
stage for the world premiere of 13 of Andy
Warhol’s screen tests titled “13,Most Beauti-

- ml‘),

The event will showcase 13 of the more
than 500 screen tests that famous pop artist
and Pittsburgh native Andy .Warhol filmed
of guests who visited his famous Factory
workshop in the mid—’60s and add live mu-

‘sical performances to the previously silent

ﬁlms.

The subjects of Warhol’s screen tests‘

ranged from ﬁlmmakers to musicians to
actors to unknowns. Anyone who exuded
glamour or piqued the artist’s curiosity was
asked to sit in front of Warhol’s video cam-
era while he focused a close—up angle on
their face. I

Some of the most well-known subjects

include Bob Dylan, Edie Sedgwick, Dennis
Hopper and Salvador Dali.

Until this Friday, the screen tests have
only been shown in galleries, without audio
accompaniment.

The 13 chosen screen tests for this event
will be shown with a live musical score com-
posed and performed by Dean Wareham
and Britta Phillips, who scored several other
ﬁlms, including “The Squid and the Whale”
and “Just Like the Son.”

Wareham’s ﬁrst involvement with a War-
hol-related project arose in 1996, when he
composed a song for the ﬁlm “I Shot Andy
Warho .” '

More than a decade later, Wareham’s ca-
reer led him to a second encounter when he
and Phillips were approached by The Andy
Wmhol Museum to score the project “13
Most Beautiful  Songs for Andy Warhol’s
Screen Tests.”

“I’m a huge Warhol fan,” ‘said Wareham. I

“Sometimes I have to pinch myself when I
realize that I’m doing this.”
Joining them on stage will be Anthony

.Lal\/Iarca and Matt Sumrow, who complete

the foursome sometimes billed as Dean and
Britta with the Back Numbers.

Together, the musicians will provide the
ﬁrst musical accompaniment to the Pitts-
burgh legend’s short ﬁlms.

down to a console, writing customized C
scripts to control the large, programs that
run -on their spaceship’s main computer.

Why is this? Put simply, modern com-
puter interfaces are boring and utilitarian.
Macintosh OS X and Windows Vista have
made an effort to use neat animations and

pretty text smoothing to make their inter-‘ _

faces more attractive, but the fact remains
that in most practical applications, ‘these
little fripperies are immediately turned
off to gain better and faster performance,
as well as more reliability and simplicity.

Hewlett—Packard recently unveiled a new
line of computers designed to make the user
interface both practical and sexy.

The HP TouchSmart IQ series of desk-
tops are a new entry from

Hewlett-Packard into the all-in—one desk-
top market. The Apple iMac and-offerings

from Dell and Gateway add to the world of
all-in-ones. .

HP’s machine has a bit of an edge,
however. It comes standard with a
touch screen,  the user the abil-
ity to interact with the operating system

without using a mouse and keyboard.

The machine does come with the tradi-
tional fnouse and keyboard,  the user

the ﬂexibility to utilize non-touch applica-'

tions, or to control an application whose in-
terface is too awkward to use touch sensitivity.

0 You might be  -_— and rightfully
so — that the idea of touch screens isn’t new
anymore. Table notebook or laptop PCs have
been around for a good amount of time, and

a new science has already taken a foothold,"

developing applications to.‘ utilize most fully
the touch capabilities of tablet PCs.

Here at Pitt, dining facilities use touch-
screen point-of-sale machines to handle din-

/ing hall transactions. - I

The innovation of the computer lies not
in the touch screen, but in the fact that HP
designed it from the ground up to utilize one.
As such, the HP Touchsmart computer gives
users touch—screen technology affordably. ,

Until now, touch—screen monitors, for use
with traditional computer boxes, have been

somewhat expensive.

A 15-inch LCD touch screen from
Hewlett—Packardicosts about $500, a signiﬁ-
cant increase over a traditional 15-inch LCD
monitor from the same or a different manu-
facturer. .

" On top of this $500, a touch-screen en-
thusiast would have to build a CPUS box.

Although a CPU can be purchased inexpen— ‘

sively, the entire computer cost starts out at
$500, before the ﬁrst computer component
is even chosen. . _

Comparatively, the lower-end HP TouchS-

,mart IQ504t series machine costs $1299. By

lower—end, this does not mean the computer
is underpowered. The machine comes com-

I plete -with a 22-inch touch—screen LCD, a 2.0 . <

GHz Intel Core 2' Duo processor, 4 
bytes of memory, a 320 Gigabyte hard drive,
a DVD burner and a respectively performing
Intel Graphics Accelerator chip.

For users who wish to customize their
machines and sufficiently “trick them out,”
HP allows upgrades of up to a 2.1 GHz
T8100 Intel Core 2 Duo, 750 Gigabytesof
hard-drive space, blue-ray and DVD burner
combo drive, and a beefy GeForce 9600M
graphics card with 512 l\/[B of dedicated
graphics memory.

Touch screen brings HP intothe future

Some drawbacks of the machine must be
pointed out, however. Firstof all, although
touch screens are neat, there are relatively
few applications designed’ to take advantage
of them successfully. ‘i

It seems expected that paying the pre-

miumfor such a computer will only lead to-

continued use of the mouse and keyboard
and only rare utilization of the touch screen’s
full capabilities.

I The machine, although cheaper than
building a touch-screen machine from ran-
dom components,.is noticeably more expen-
sive than its equivalent “standard” computer.

_The equivalently conﬁgured Pavilion ma-

chine, complete with a 22” non-touch LCD
monitor, will cost $859, versus the $1300 for
a TouchSmart. ’

The HP Touchsmart does display a step
in the right direction. Computers seem to be

stagnating a bit in terms of human-computer.
interaction. With better, less expensive touch- ,

enabled hardware available on the market,
clever algorithms that take "advantage of the
touch capabilities will begin to appear.

With better programming, of course,
comes better applications, and with better
applications, comes a ‘generally better com-
putingexperience.

Pitt professor creates his

Because the installation is a large-scale proj-
ect, its opening in the giant grocery store park-

seeing it in full. - P '

‘This site is much smaller and tighter, so
it will enhance the surpiise of it and allow it

- to be more compact,” he said of his choice in

Braddock.
Derry is no stranger to workingwith uncon-

ventional mateiials He said _he enjoys working ~

He recently did a project in conjunction

with Pittsburgh’s Parking Day that involved
- covering an SUV with a quilt made from

In another public project in Indianapolis,
Ind., Derry marked the path of a stream that
once existed but had been diverted under-
neath the city. The completion of this venture

meant getting the permission of many owners '

The immense surrounding space ended up A

. — something that Derry said he believes to be

one of his greatest accomplishments.

The approval of the public regularly chal-
lenges him, and this battle is apparent in the
upcoming Braddock installation. The support
of Bradd0_ck’s mayor,]ohn Fetterman, and the
Braddock Youth Project made “Stillness” pos-
sible but Derry understands that not everyone
will be as enthusiastic

_ “Some _people don’t have time or interests
in stuff that doesn?t solve immediate problems,
but I think a’ lot of those ‘people are the ones
that will just drive by, so I don’t hear directly
from them,” he said. - I j I

Derry said that his use _of secondhand bed

Warhol screen tests premiere

five without — to complement each short
film.

They chose to include covers from The
Velvet Underground and Bob Dylan.

The four musicians will perform Dylan’s ’

song, “I’ll Keep it with Mine,” during the
screen test of Nico, a German actress / sing-
er/ model, to whom.Dylan actually gave the
song.

“I did research on each character that we
were trying to do music for,” said Wareham.
“I tried to figure out the mood of each.
Some of them are very somber, some are
quite playful, some are sad and some are
funny. So what’s going on on the screen
kind of dictates.” .

To preparefor scoring the pieces, Ware-
ham also did extensive research on Warhol.
Through the movies and documentaries he
watched and the books he read, he devel-
oped an even greater interest in Warhol and

the different people who frequented the"
‘Factory. _ -

Throughout the process of scoring the
event, Wareham contemplated what Warhol
himself would think of the musical accom-
paniment.

‘‘‘It’s like taking these great films" and
adding music to them, and you wonder if
you’re allowed to do that. But the more you

read about Warhol, you realize he’s always
OK with anything. He was like ‘Oh yeah,
that sounds glamorous, let’s just do it,”’ ex-
plained Wareham with a laugh.

The event will be performed in other cit-
ies next year, but the choice of Pittsburgh as
the premiere site was deliberate. .

_ “I think it’s probably going to look bet-
ter in Pittsburgh — I know we’re doing the

‘ show other places — but the level of atten-

tion  detail that’s being brought to the
production there, it’s just going to look bet-
ter in Pittsburgh than it is anywhere else,”

‘said Wareham. -

»“I _guess in Pittsburgh, you’re ‘lucky.

, You’ve got The Warhol Museum there, and

sometimes they show these [films], but you
won’t get to see them with music [at the mu-
seum],” he added. "Basically this is a once in
a lifetime opportunity.”

F The co-comrnissioners for the project
are The Warhol Museum, along with the
Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, which also orga-
nized the Festival of Firsts.

Veronica Corpuz, of the Cultural Trust,
reiterated Wareham’s excitement for pre-
rniering "13 Most Beautiful in Pittsburgh."

“It’s kind of a great event to close this
festival of interdisciplinary and genre-bend-
ing performances and events,” she said.

The Youngstown State Pen-

team, 5-3, two Fridays ago. But in
the end, that was secondary.

What was important had been

displayed ‘on posters scattered_

throughout campus in the weeks

. leading up to the event. The game

was in memory of Lauren Leigh
Ruud.

Ruud, who would have been
entering her sophomore year at
Pitt, passed away from cancer in
August after working ‘as game

Jackie White, one of Ruud’s
best friends, was at the game.-

“In the spring of ’08, Lauren
was diagnosed with Non—Hodg—
kin’s Lymphoma,” said White.

“She began her battle with only

words and thoughts of optimism,
in hopes that she would be back
here helping the team out today.”

“Aug. 11,. 2008, we received
a phone call saying she had 24

hours left’ to live. She struggled.

hard until Aug. _1 5, when she lost
the battle against cancer.”

“I’m a football player. I just
happen to be stuck in a kicker’s
body,” he said.

So in grade school, in Upper
St. Clair, Lee focused on soccer.
He played football, primarily as a
iunning back, but he didrft begin
seriously kicking until the end of
his high school career.

“I started to generate a love
for kicking,” said Lee. “I like go-

‘ i__ng out there when the pressure’s

on — being able to test yourself
in those clutch situations.”

He’s trained himself to do
just that.

All successful kickers, Lee
said, know howvto master the
mental aspect of the game.

“You can very easily get
caught up in the game and lose

You also need conﬁdence. In
Pitt’s recent 26-21 victory over

Finally healthy, Nlustakas starting to make impact

. ‘ Micha Heaterl Photo Editor
A knee  forced Gus Mustakas [95] to sit out for the majority of last season, but

the redshirt junior is ﬁnally healthy and making an impact on the defense.

 

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Ealto/' '

With an ice pack wrapped around his
left knee, Gus Mustakas held his bags and
answered questions beneath Navy—Marine
Corps Memorial Stadium on Saturday.

Mustakas, who tore the ACL in his left
knee last season, was feeling a bit sore. But
the grin on his face sure didn’t show it.
Aside from the ice on his knee, one thing
was evident as he made his way toward the
team bus: He was back.

Mustakas earned his first start of the
year on Saturday in place of Mick Wil-
liams, who went down during the week
with a concussion. Mustakas, avstarter two
years ago who had 15 games of starting
experience behind him, was happy to fi-

inally get back into the flow of the defense ,

and break loose.

_“I feel like I really needed this game,”
said Mustakas of Pitt’s 42-21 win over
Navy. “It felt" good to start making plays
again.”

Mustakas, a redshirt junior, finished the

Mustakas and his knee held up. ‘He said
that’s sonriething that couldn’t have hap-

“We had the bye week, and I had a little

knee not swelling up, it felt real good.

“_It was the worst feeling seeing [Pitt]
play last year, being on the sideline. But I
felt good. Hopefully I’ll be going for the
rest of the season.”

Pitt can deﬁnitely use Mustakas, who at
6-feet—3i—inches, 275 pounds, has proven in
the past that he can be aibrick in the mid-

line held Navy fullback Eric Kettani to

If the defensive line can continue to
see production from guys like ’Mustakas,

unit will help Pitt win a lot of games. .

Lee, page 160

Part of Lee’s secret is to ignore any
hype surrounding the team. A

Don’t focus on the fact that Pitt moves
in and out of the .top 25 rankings. Don’t
focus on the fact that ESPNU said ear-
lier this month that having “an automatic
kicker in Conor Lee” was a large part of
the team’s recent success.

Lee laughed when he heard about that
article. \ .
“I have two or three bad games, and
they’ll say the opposite,” he said. “Five
years from now, they aren’t going to re-
member me.”

So he takes life one game at a time, he
said, and measures his success by whether
the team wins or loses.

’ Lee said his role on the team is unlike.

that of most players, because he’s not out
there calling plays or running the defense.
Pitt coach Dave Wmmstedt said it’s im-
portant that Lee recognizes this, because
it helps" the players’ work together success-
In’ fact, that’s what sets Lee°apart from
previous Pitt kickers. '
. “Conor’s not your typical kicker,” said
Wannstedt. A _
“Most kickers area little strange, and

not all of them are oneaof the guys. Conor’s

different. He sees the big picture.”
Lee said he tries to motivate his team-
mates by quietly supporting them, both on

' and off the field,

‘_‘I’ve seen it all,” he said. .
Lee joined Pitt in 2004 but didn’t play
until 20.06. ~

He sat on the bench during the 2005_

Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, in which Pitt lost to
Utah, 35-7.

Lee said he remembers what it’s like to
be shocked transitioning into collegiate
football, and he can therefore help the

October 22, 2008

Lee staying dependable
both on and offpthefield ‘

younger players.

‘‘It’s a different culture. It’s a lot more
intense than high school,” he said. “You
need talent to play. But experience, it goes
a long way. People, with a few exceptions,
don’t just come in and play.”

Lee said his faith helped him -get
through his own transition into college.

“I have a strong faith in God;” said Lee.
“I practice it, and that’s helped me greatly
with my success in football and academ-
ics.” L

Lee said he reads and studies the Bible
when he can, and he always tries to do his
school work a week ahead of time, in case
something pops up at the last minute.

Lee graduated this past April with a
dual bachelor’s degree in business. and
economics. A .

He is currently working toward his
master of business administration in the
Katz Graduate School of Business. 0

Lee said he’d “love to play in the NFL,
but that’s a long shot for anybody.”

His other dream, he said, is to own a
business, though he’s not sure what type.

He said he’s fascinated by the way peo-
ple manipulate messages to promote their
products.

But pursuing business and discovering

' this interest, he said, was a bit of an ac-

cident. . .

“I didit because  my friends were do-
ingfit,” said Lee.

“I’ve gained an appreciation for it. I
like the idea of managing and motivating
people.” ‘

For now, his mind is focused on Pitt’s ..

next game, which is on Saturday against
Rutgers.

Football, he said quickly, is -his No. 1
priority. ' .

Pitt hockey raises funds

and cancer survivor Mario Lemieux. Per its
mission statement, it “continues to award
grants for cancer research and other wor-
thy causes.”

Game staff manager Kaitlin Mainwar-
ing said the donations are continuing to
come in.

“\X/e still have donations coming in on a 2

daily basis and will wrap up our fundraising
drive later this mont ,” said Mainwaring.
As Chinese auctions and raffles for au-
tographedi Mario Lemieux memorabilia
and Pittsburgh Penguins tickets went on
in the pavilion, on the ice Youngstown
State felled the Panthers in an unexpected
result. _ 
Pitt fell behind, but the team’s play
wasn’t the most visible thing in on the ice.
While the game went on, the green rib-
bon stickers visible on the players’ helmets
and the “Team Lauren” shirts in the crowd
served as a reminder to the meaningfulness
of the event.
Pitt coach Tom Rieck saidithe game was
more about Lauren than anything else.

is cu conducting clinical trials in the following areas:

“I thought the fundraiser was a big suc-
cess,” said Rieck. “We raised a lot of mon-
ey and I want to thank everybody that was
in. attendance.” _

Mainwaring continued the praise and
thanks.

“Lauren took every day after she was di-
agnosed with optimism and a smile, always
comforting everyone by thoughts of over-
coming her cancer,” said Mainwaring. “She
lived every day as if tomorrow would nev-
er come, but never believed for one second
that tomorrow wasn’t already there.”

Close friend and coworker Shayna
Stout summed up the young woman Fri-
day evening: “She had the most contagious
and warm smile, and was remembered by
anyone who was lucky enough to meet her.
She was a ﬁghter and always stayed posi-

tive, which inspired everyone. She was. a.

truly beautiful person who will stay in our
hearts forever.” ’

Watch out for more power

with tight ends, McCoy 

Gladysz, page 17

could see against Rutgers at Heinz Field
this coming Saturday.

Rutgers (2-5, 1-2 Big East) lost to Navy,
23-21, in late September. The only other
time Rutgers put up 20 or more points
came in a 38-0 blowout of Morgan State.
Still, the Scarlet Knights are coming off
a 12-10 win against Connecticut, and no
game should be looked at as an easy win
for Pitt.

There are a few things Pitt did well
against Navy offensively that it might con-
tinue against Rutgers to keep the running
game fresh and the defense guessing.

The Panthers used a lot of motion
from the tight ends, sometimes moving
two at once. During one play, Pitt lined up
in a set with two tight ends Oohn Pelusi
and Nate Byham), two backs (LeSean Mc-
Coy and Conredge Collins) and a receiver
(Cedric McGee). i

Pelusi and Byham started on the right
side, then motioned simultaneously to the

left. When the ball was snapped, Pitt had ,

both Pelusi and Byham to seal the hole,

along with Collins to lead the way. But this

play, while simple, can lead to big things "

for Pitt.

For one, McGee is a threat at receiver
on the outside. Both tight ends — especial-
ly Byham — have the skills to make plays
when covered by a linebacker or an under-
sized corner. Because of this, the defense
is at.a disadvantage. If the unit expects
the run, offensive coordinator Matt Ca-
vanaugh can make some changes and add
in a pass or two to keep the defense hon-

est. Add in a deep threat like freshman 1

Jonathan Baldwin on the outside, and the
play—action pass is just waiting there to
strike. .

McCoy will have a chance to eat up
some big yards on Saturday against a team
Without a great .rush defense. When Mc-
Coy starts bringing the defense up, that
outside man will open right up.
