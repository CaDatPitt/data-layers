Cap and Gown. after naming

tor, is hunting for? student talent.

Men interestedin any phase of
the production may see ﬁlms of
previous shows in room 332 C1 at
1:30 o’clock and 3:30 o’clock
this afternoon. Two smaller
groups saw the motion pictures
yesterday.

To stage its ﬁrst-post-war per-
formance, Cap and Gown needs
24 actors, 12 singers, 25-32 chorus
dancers, 14 musicians (including
several pianists), 25 production

~men, 25 stage hands, and 25 busi-

ness staff members. Except for the

U niversit yDi gs,
Consolidates

Heating Plan

That yawning chasm surround-
ing the Cathedral is not a trap for
enemy tanks or a big-inch pipe to
dump the campus- smoke on an
unsuspecting suburb.

The University architects mere-
ly are extending the Oakland
heating system to four medical
center hospitals.

Women’s, Presbyterian, Eye and

Ear, and Children’s hospitals will

have more economical heating fa-
cilities when the steam mains are
connected with the Cathedral. Ac-
cording to Glenn S. Peacock, Uni-
versity heating engineer, the
project should be completed dur-
ing the winter.

Two parallel steel mains will
carry “high pressure" steam. One
line will serve as an emergency
conduit and a third will return the
condensation . to the Belleﬁeld
boiler plant.

Steam pressure in the pipes at
the Cathedral will be approxi-
mately 170 pounds. It will be
down to 110 pounds by the'time it
reaches the hospitals, where the
pressure will be reduced further
for heating registers, water heat-
ers, and laundry service.

Eventually, the engineers hope
to extend the pipe-line to the plant
now in operation at Thaw hall.
The mains will continue to Alum-
ni hall, State hall, Falk school,
and the Dental inﬂrmary.

Manholes and safety valves in-
stalled at intervals above the lines
will facilitate repairs.

The units concerned will share
construction costs on a non-proﬁt,
pro—rat.a. basis, explains Peacock.
In each..building, steam ﬂow me-
ters will measure consumption.

Arthur Gaeth To Talk  
On Nuernberg Trials

Widely traveled newspaper cor-
respondent and radio commenta-
tor Arthur Gaeth will speak to
Pitt students on what "he saw at

the Neurenberg trials November
1 in Stephen Foster Memorial at
10:30 A. M. Mr. Gaeth was the
only American broadcaster per-
mitted to see the recent execu-
tion ol"; 10 high Nazis officials at
Neurnberg. ‘ '
Sent here by the Association of
American Colleges under the
sponsorship of Dean Stanton S.
Crawford of the college, he will
speak from two decades experi-
ences in Europe. During the cru-
cial years from 1926 to 1936 dur-
ing which the background of the

present war was developed Mr. '

Gaeth was in Germany, Austria,
and Czechoslovakia. where he be-
came closely associated with gov-
ernment and education leaders.
More recently he spent two
months at the San Francisco con-
ference for Mutual Broadcasting
system and the conference. of the
big four leaders whei. meeting in
Paris. This year he received the

Aﬁrst interview granted by ‘Yugo-

slavian Marshall Tito. Later he
saw the elections in Greece and
all parts of Europe and the trial
and conviction of General Mihaj-
lovic. _ ,

Born in Milwaukee, Mr. Gaeth
made his ﬁrst appearance on ra-
dio over Radio East Prussia, "in

'Koenigsbuerg, Germany. He lec-;

tured then ‘on’ “An American
Travelogue”. in the Germany

Athr Gaeth A

Language, and in 1933 began his
ﬁrst regular radio news.broad-
casts in the Czech language over
Radio Prague and Radio Brno.

He has become familiar to many
Americans through his political,
economic and historical lectures
on Europe which have been pre-
sented in his own popular style.
In 1939 his audience here was
greatly increased when he went on
the air at Provo, Utah over the
Intermountain Network. Since
1943 he has been heard daily from
coast to coast.over Mutual Broad-
casting system, originating from
Salt Lake City. This was .termin-
ated when he r,etu'rned' to Europe
in, November of 1945.

is the -vice-president. The other officers-elected were Blanche

I-l_erron, secretary, and Helen Reis, treasurer. . 4
Since the previous officers, who were elected in the spring

resigned their positions,
necessary for the association to
conduct another election. The
nominating committee chose an
entirely new slate from among
members of the council because
there was no ruling~in the Pan-
hellenic by-laws to meet with
such a situation.

sonnel work, Rusty, .a senior at
Pitt,’ is majoring in psychology.
In addition to being chaplain of
Delta Delta Delta, she is a senior

Board, Xylon, Quax, and the Pitt
News staff. She, also served as
editor of the 1945-46 Panhellenic
association handbook, “Who’s Who
in Sororities at Pitt.”

Charmaine, also a senior, is
majoring in business administra-
tion. She was secretary of the
Panhellenic association during the
past school year. This year she has
taken on several responsible posi-
tions including senior mentor,
member of the high school rela-
tions committee of WSGA, and
treasurer of Alpha Epsilon Phi.

A history major and practice
teacher at Schenley High school,
Blanche Herron, another senior,
intends to make teaching her ca-
reer. At the present time, she is
magazine chairman of Phi_l\/Iu,
senior mentor, and a member of
the freshman committee of the
YWCA. ,

Helen Reis, a junior majoring in
psychology, is corresponding sec-
retary of Kappa Kappa Gamma.

Men’s Rushing ~

Re-Scheduled

Two major changes have been
m.ade in the men’s fraternity rush-
ing rules:

1. Rushing .is now postponed».
one week until Monday, October 2'
28. _.

2. The rushing period has been

reduced from four to three weeks. a

Because of conditions resulting,
from the power strike, the Inter-«
fraternity Council made the-twﬁ"
changes. It was felt by the coun-
cil that due to the ‘two week strike
vacation neither the fraternities
nor the new students had had suf-
ﬁcient opportunity of m’ee.tingf
each other.

In the past the rushing period
extended only over three days.
This year because of the frater-
nities’ need lor knowing the
rushees better one lull month was <
set aside as a rush period. This
period was cut one week by the
IF council because it was running
too late in the school year.

Under present plans the rush
period will start at 8 o’clock Mon-
day morning, October 28. Through-
out the period only one mixed’
social event may be scheduled
during each week. No over-night
guests are permitted in the house.
during the rush period.

state of disrepair of the Panther uniform worn by Pitt’s famous
Tlfootball mascot. Since that time, word has reached us that a
"new Panther skin has been ordered. lt’s arrival has been de-

Confused Greek—let.ter men and women have been walkii.1g

Allan I. Roth, Sports;

the
was who. l/Vhen ‘one spokeof a fraternity to which a friend
belonged, he was immediately asked wheth_er the friend was a
man or a woman. English instructors have been trying to ‘make
excuses to their students for the peculiar acception at Pitt of
what seemed an out and out grammatical error. ‘

This semester attempts are being made by interested fac-
tions at Pitt to clarify the situation, to call wonien’s “frater-
nities”, sororities, thus relinquishing to the male Greeks on
campus the once all-en.compas_singname.

Theiwhole mix-up began some’2O years ago when the Na- .

tional Panhellenic council asked that local Panhellenic organi-
zations change their names to read fraternity instead of sorori-
ty. In suggesting this change, National felt the name was more
digniﬁed because at this time wom_en’s Greek-letter social
groups were in -their infancy while men ’s fraternities were older
and better established, and that by adopting the word frater-
Iiifty totheir name, women’s groups might gain prestige. '

I, When the news reached Pitt, the request was taken serious-
 An attempt was made to effect the change, and, as has been
evident, the change was a complete success. But few other
schools heeded the suggestion. This resulted in a half and half
situation which National Panhellenic council never tried to
remedy. Pitt, however, was so successful in changing the name
that many sororities are now chartered as “fraternities.”

9, This ye_ar Pitt sorority women are "tired of explaining their
strhnge name; they want to be conventional; So from here on
in Pitt women will belong to sororities and allow Pitt men to
retain the distinction of being fraternity members. _

, mAlong with the _troublesome problem of _liviiig quarters,
Pitt married_veterans voice considerable grief over the cur-
rent athletic activities card situation. ,

 Mainly, this “product of the times” group would like to
Wing their wivesﬂto the football games . . . to sit in -the stu-
dent section with them. At the time of printing, the athletic

ofﬁce has been unable to ﬁnd a satisfactory solution to the

We can well understand the difficulties involved. Opening
the student section to non-students could cause an increase of
gate crashing- It would necessitate enlarging again the already
overcrowded student section. Mr. Hagan has tried to meet the
bulging student body’s requirements by the addition of several
thous.and new seats. The proposed innovation might bring
pressure for further backward steps in University policy con-
cerning the cheering section. —

- ‘The fact remains, however, that these students would like
to. have an answer to an important personal problem. These
married students are as avid rooters as the single men and
women now occupying the student section. According to reports
from other colleges, theirwives are even more so. VVe think

that the University athletic ofﬁce might do something to meet '

this unusual situation.

, Our suggestion is that some consideration be given to;stu-
dents holding athletic tickets who want to sit in other sections
with persons who have bought. regular tickets. We know that
tax problems might present ‘themselves, but it is certainly worth
a» try to put a veteran’s or other married studentls life at the
iniversity on a par with the single st.udent’s. How about it,

3 * Q .

Why a Feline? It

By Bill cetrow

He’s a big part of Pitt. He goes
with the school as do the cheer-
leaders and the nationally re-
nowned band.
creature that perches precariously
on the goal posts and usually man-
ages to lie prostrate on the sward
after a well-planned “fall” from
the cross bar. He’s, nimble, he’s
humorous and, above all, he’s a
symbol’of»Pitt might, (erase from
your memory these past six mor-
bid years, if possible, on tl.
iron). He’s the Pitt Panther..

But where originated this tradi-
’tion_’of the frolicksome feline,_and
why not a bison or zebra or hippo?
The jungle cat became a" part of
Pitt lore back in 19i09—-the pre-
vious year had seen the Western
University of Pennsylvania emerge
into the collegiate world as the
University of Pittsburgh—when a
group of students and prominent
alumni met to determine some
Way in which to bolster the school
spirit that had ebbed miserably
low.

The Panther got the preferential
nod in light of the fact that the
species (felis concolor) was com-
mon in "local mountains in the
days when Fort Pitt was the west-
ern terminus of civilization. The
panther is a redoubtable beast
and, according to historians, has
always been regarded as a “noble
animal.”

-’Tis said that the scream of the
Panther may still‘ be heard in
some parts of the Alleghenies but
we’ve attempted no investigation
of that claim.

George M. P. Baird, civic leader

and Pitt graduate, ﬁrst supported
the qualiﬁcations of the Panther
The animal claimed alliance with
no other school, his golden fur
harmonized with school hues and
the accident of alliteration made
the name attractive; The Panther
began to, follow the team.
This is in the way of incidental
intelligence. Sliould someone ask
the “why” and “wherefore” of
that refugee from a zoo romping
about the stadium turf, you’ll have
all_the answers.

good to see something about some-

or not, but come to think of it, we
may lose our jobs if we don’t.

are having a Halloween Dance,

that they have two hams U0 raf-

be in mind for rushing or after.
It usually takes more than a lack
of power and house./-to achieve
that solemnity. But perhaps we
can swing their elections Mon-

Last, but not least, to be trite,
the Delts elected Dave Hughes

Blossom Henry
Says, ‘Oui, Oui’

Miss Blossom Henry, associate
professor of modern languages,
was married on August 20 in the
American Church at Buenos Aires,
Argentina to Philip B. Massey of
Buenos Aires.

Following the wedding, the cou-
ple paid a short visit to their
country home at Nor del Plata, a
sea resort 250 miles from the
capital. They are now living at
home at Calle Pampa 1851, Bel-
grano.

Mrs. Massey, now on leave of
absence, is one of Pitt’s best
known and loved faculty mem-
bers. She represented the Uni-
versity at the International Con-
gress of History at Brussels, Bel-
gium in 1923. She has been presi-
dent of -the Pittsburgh chapter,
Alliance Francaise.

Mr. Massey, a leading architect
of Buenos Aires, is originally from
Denver, Colorado, Miss Henry’s
home town. He has built many of
Buenos Aires’ famous buildings,
among them the Ward College
and a group of churches.

YMCA Lounge Receives

Furniture. Magazines

Twelve leather upholstered
chairs and four smoking stands
have been added to the YMCA
lounge, gifts of the Pittsburgh
YMCA. In addition, the Pittsburgh
Y has provided a double desk,
which was sandpapered and re-
surfaced with varnish by Dick
Wallace, house chairman, and
fourteen subscriptions to current
magazines for the beneﬁt of the
students.

In commenting on these im-
provements, J. Frederick Miller,
executive secretary, said, “The in-
crease of students at Pitt made
it necessary to increase our facili-
ties.’’ . '

Blame George

For all those people who
have had elevator doors shut on
their faces lately, there is a
reason why.

It is not that the elevator op-
erators cannot read the Depart-
ment of Labor And Industry’s
neat little plaque which legally
allows the cars to carry eighteen
people. The operator is_ not
holding it against you because
you stepped on his toe the last
time you got off.

The reason is the power strike.
With the available power now
cut down to its present amount,
it is impossible for each ele-
vator to carry its normal capac-
ity of passengers. Until the
strike is over cars which operate

between the ground and eigh-
teenth ﬂoors will carry ten peo-
ple instead of the usual eigh-
teen, and those which run to the
thirty-third ﬂoor will limit their
number to twelve. So next time
don’t grumble when that door
slides shut separating you from
your friends and making you
late for your next hour exam.
Just remember -- what if you
had to walk?

Freeman 1 Talks
To Educators

Douglas Southall Freeman, not-
ed biographer, addressed a ca-
pacity audience on “Human Val-

 

ues in Social Sciences“ last Fri_- .
day night in Stephen Foster me- ~
The program was the sec- '

morial.
0nd of a series’ provide-d by the
Pitcairn—Crabbe Foundation and
sponsored by -the School of Edu-

cation of the University of Pitts-A '

burgh. ' .

Winner of the 1934 Pulitzer
Prize for biography and current
editor of the Richmond News
leader, Dr. Freeman spoke of free-
dom in its connection with wars
and dictators. “A dictator’s first

act on the usurpation of authority ..

is to destroy the free press and
free radio without which no man’s
word can“carry far.” _

The speaker borrowed a phrase
from Robert E. Lee, the subject of
his great biography, when he con-
cluded, saying that “history
teaches us to hope.” ‘

In 1936 Dr. Freeman delivered
the commencement address here =
and was given the unusual hon-'
orary degree of doctor of the more
humane letters.

Admission was by ticket sup-
plied free to the educators of,
Western Pennsylvania.

’46 Best Year

1946 has been a greatyear for
Georgie. Starting in May, she won

third division with the Alcoma
team in the W. P. G. A. matches.
July brought the Lehman cup
ﬁnals in which she defeated Jane
Martin and set a new course rec-
ord; with a 78. The previous rec-
ord had been set the day before
at 79 by Mrs. Lee Mason.

The Lehman ﬁnal brought two
of the district’s top Women golf-
ers together-—.-Zinsser and Ma-
son. After 18 holes the match was
even and the air-tight battle con-
tinued to the 22nd hole when
Georgette won out brilliantly.

August presented the West
Penn Open and the same duo met
again, but Mrs. Mason beat
Georgette after 16 holes.

To round out a very promising
year, Georgette won the Alcoma
women’s title for the sixth
straight time this month.

Graduatedfrom the University.

tending graduate school for her
master’s degree in education.

Backﬁeld Problem

As this sheet goes‘ to press, it
is quite likely that the Pitt coach-
ing staff is viewing apractice that
may well change the grid outlook
for our club throughout its re-
maining schedule. Tailbacks

Bobby Lee and Jack Smodic have
recovered from their injuries suf-
ficiently to earn the doctor’s okay.
However, Wes Fesler ha emphat-
ically stated that he will not use
either man until they have proven
their readiness in one or two hot
scrimmage sessions.

If either or both men are de-
clared ﬁt for duty, the Blue and
Gold backﬁeld may take on an
entirely new coat of varnish. The
oﬁensive situation has reached a
sad state of affairs. The Pittmen
have never been able to operate
under full speed in their‘ backﬁeld
at any time during this season. In
fact, in the last two contests, they
have been operating under 50%

power with the starting fullback .

and left half on the shelf.

Fesler and backﬁeld boss, Dick
Fisher, have constantly been
forced to shift and reshift men in
the ball-carrying positions. As a
result, the Pitt ball—hauling corps
has been more scrambled than
ma’s morning eggs. _

Smodic is the speediest tailback
on the squad but Lee can also set
a-quick pace. Both men can pass
well, which will provide an added
threat in the Jungle Cat backﬁeld

when they return. It will also di-
vide the pitching responsibilities
which have been carried by Cec-
com and De Pasqua.

Thus the Panthers would have"

a more deceptive and _a more resil-
ient attack. This club of ours
has been performing with loads
of pluck and resolution and some-
thing should pop in their favor
soon. The Cats have been aiming
to put the skids under somebody
and perhaps refurnishing the tail-
back spot will set up the neces-
sary impetus.

Aerial, Circus
, This Marquette club which
will buzz over the stadium turf
tomorrow afternoon can cause
‘the Panthers plenty of grief.
They boast of an excellent pass-
ing attack. Any ball club that
can complete 55 out of 108
aerials against better than av-
erage competition is strictly big-
league. \

Didn’t Miss Much .
The thirty odd Temple football

fans who ﬂew across the state to

see the tussle at the stadium last
Saturday afternoon arrived safely
—just in time to see the last. one
and one-half minutes of the mud-
dy duel. Included in the party
was the gent that was supposed to
spot the Owls for the local play-
by—play broadcast. With all that
mud he wouldn’t have been much
help anyway.
