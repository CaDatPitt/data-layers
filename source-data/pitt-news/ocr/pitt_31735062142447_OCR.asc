f, ._ ; participation in the present conﬂict,
s_ ' i the deans of the various schools
,1 iv; have dismissed all fourth hour
 f classes.

‘lug-‘.4 Possibly the chief student con-
1 ' §'_ tribution’ to the war effort has been
in i the stamp and bond drive which has
0 5 brought in virtually $21,000 since
I , _February of this year.

Purpose of Monday's program
_ is“ to commemorate that morning
 ;of December 7, 1941, when the
 _ treacherous Japanese bombing of
 Pearl Harbor plunged the United

P ’ States into war.

Edward Tablac, BA43, in charge
of .Monday’s events, has announced
that the program is threefold: (a)
one student will express what he

5 believes the past year of war has

2‘ meant to the students of the Uni-
T versity, and what the future should
or will probably. mean to them.

,_(b) Administration through Vice

 

T Chancellor Rufus Fitzgerald will.

present to the students the Univer-
'sity”s position in the future and the
students’ position in relation to the
University.

T ' During the program, the Army

third semester at the University.
High spot of the first semester
campaign which netted $15,604.10
was MacArthur day held April 15,
when students bought $3,216.25 in
stamps and bonds.

With only a few sales days during
the summer, Druids, honorary ac-
tivities fraternity, brought in over
$600.

This semester, the committee is
headed ' by co-chairman Richard
Hartz, BA43, and Ruth Becker,
Ed44. SFA has aided the drive each
semester with a maintenance,allot-
ment, and various groups on cam-
pus have volunteered almost every
week to act as salesmen.

Up until last week, this semes-
ter’s totals stood at $4,551.20,
after Women’s Choral had helped

the committee bring in $242.50 -

the week before. Of this amount,
$130 was in bonds, and $112.50 in
stamps.

Acting in cooperation with Allan
F. Clark, Pennsylvania War Sav-
ings administrator, the committee
plans to inaugurate a “jeep a week”
program, with $500 being set as the
amount necessary to help the treas-
ury buy another jeep. Since students
and faculty have already purchased
over $4500 in stamps and bonds this
semester, the nine jeeps to be dis-
played with the University insignia
at Monday’s Commemoration Day
program will represent what we
have done so “far this term.

For each $500 the committee

‘turns over to the Treasury, a jeep

will be brought to the University
and inscribed with the University
insignia.

“Good Neighbors,” an exhibit on
Latin America is being offered at-
the present time by the War Infor-

University. ~ The exhibit covers
every phase of life in Latin Ameri- A

geography are just a few of the
phases of South American life
dealt with in the exhibit.

Of special interest in the display

al insignia of all Latin American
countries. Large color maps of
Latin America are also being

or plates -showing native Latin
American dress.

which have duplicates may be taken
from the library. Books in the dis-
play may not be taken from the li-

I 5-’ . For instance, our war aims. As long as they were in the
Atlantic Charter stage,_abstract, muddled, platitudinous, con-
tradictory, there was little and unviolent opposition. But as
8oo'_nas far-‘sighted Henry Wallace reduced these broad decla-
rations to simple, concrete terms—a quart of milk a day for
every human, a world-highway, an international public works

"  blending of the political democracy of the United States with
 the economic democracy of the Soviets———that’s when he ran

bine, the Tories and proto-fascists of this country tripped into
-the Vice-president. TIME called him “politely immature,”
2-LIFE called him a “glowing orator” and gave him “a richly
 deserved horselaugh.” Others attributed various shades of

° And at Pitt this week came the first student resolutions
~on their place in the war. Women’s Self Government Associ-
, ~ ation, WSGA, has listed a'set of war resolutions that are ﬁne,
 sensible,~constructive. They have listed, in simple, practical,‘
. unsensational fashion, just what they think must be done to
. ” further the University’s all-out participation in the War.

.  "They talk of things everyone of us can understand-
: “reduction of political squabbling, a cut in the number of organi-
‘ zation meetings, curtailing of the amount of activities that
 -any one student may be in, freshman unit participation in
 .; fciv-ilian defense work and morale, a training program for
3 , women to take their place -in industry.
  1 And because these women have come down into the
‘egg ;‘world of reality with their suggestions, they can expect a lot
 f of opposition. and ».obstruction to their plan. We fully expect the
“i .2fiactivities-as-usual” clique to resent the suggestions of
WSGA. _ i , .
g_1But we hope the women won’t be silenced by such oppo-
grsitpion. They’ve got something well thoughtout, intelligently
 "planned. Now comes the inﬁnitely harder task of putting their
 plans into the University set-up. ‘ "'

‘Arsenic and Old Lace’

“Arsenic and Old Lace” comes to
the Nixon The_atre~for one week’s
engagement beginning Monday, De-
cember 7. Matinees will be given"

-on Wednesday and Saturday. \

Written by Joseph Kesselring
and produced by Howard Lindsay
and.Russel Crouse, this hilarious
farce comes as an established
Broadway success. Heightening the
interest in its appearance is the
fact that we are to have the origi-
nal New York cast that has been
playing to crowded houses on
Broadway for the past two seasons.

That exceptionally ﬁne actor,
Boris Karloff, who created the role
of Jonathan Brewster, will be seen
in the star part, and in his support
will“ be found all the distinguished
players whohave shared honors in
the play’s success. These include
Josephine Hull, Jean/Adair, John
Alexander, Clinton Sundberg, Ed-
gar Stehli and others. I’

viously announced. The original
choice of the committee, Les Brown,
was not available because of con-
tract (lifiiculties. -

Dancing- will be from 9 to 1
o’clock in the main ball room of the
William Penn hotel.

The date, the last day before the
Christmas vacation, will provide a
Christmas theme for the decora-
tions.

In past years the dance was al-
ways held in March. This year the
date was advanced because of the
large number of students graduat-
ing or leaving for the army in Jan-
uary.

To break another tradition,
dancers will be dressed informal-
ly this year. As before, the dance
is open to fraternity men only.
Price of admission per couple will
be $3.50 and tax.

During intermission the annual
fraternity sing will be held. Fred
Lisfelt of the Sun-Telegraph, Ralph

University to Offer Speech  
Clinic Courses Saturdays

By_ JOSEPHINE GOODMAN

For the first time at the Univer-
sity a spc::h clinic, is being offered
for students to get practical ex-
perience in diagnosis and speech
instruction treatment for certiﬁca-
tion in speech correction work. The
course is under the direction of the
speech and psychology depart-
ments.

Students taking the course meet
at 10 o’clock Saturday mornings in
18 Cathedral to discuss develop-
ments in cases, plan techniques,
and corrective procedures, and set
up courses of instruction for the
special cases they are working on.
The actual clinic operates from 1].
to 12 o’clock in 2117 Cathedral,
which is divided into small rooms
so that the patients can get indi-
vidual attention.‘

Five persons who stutter and
ﬁve articulatory cases are now
enrolled for speech correction.
The stutterers are given instruc-
tion in progressive relaxation;
they learn speech controls to
overcome and prevent some of the
secondary elfects of stuttering.
The articulatory cases receive
individual instruction on sounds,
then attend the group conversa-
tion to use the sounds they have
been working on.

The students plan to continue
working on these same cases until
June. ,so that they can chart the

Pitt is one of the ‘few schools in. i
such a

Pennsylvania offer-ing
course in speech instruction treat-
ment, which enables teachers to be.-
come certiﬁed in speech correction.

Certiﬁed teachers are in particular ' ‘

demand because the state has spe-

cial grants set aside to pay part of,

their salaries.

Harriet May Dunn, lecturer in
psychology, teaches this course
at the University. She is also one
of the six speech correctionists
for the Pittsburgh public schools.

“We would be very glad to have
people visit the clinic on Saturday
mornings from 11 to 1.2 o’clock in
"small numbers by appointment
through the psychology depart-
ment.” Miss Dunn stated.

Band Completes Best Year
Under Arthur and Finnerty

By MIKE LEVINE

University marching band, con-
sidered by many people to be one

of the ﬁnest college bands in the
country, has just completed the
most successful season. in its his-
tory.

Largely responsible for the
tremendous success of the per-
formances at this season’s foot-
ball games was the new system
of formations, originated by
band directors Robert L. Arthur,
assistant dean of men, and Lieu-
tenant John Finnerty.

This method is entirely different
from that used by any other college
band in that it contains, according
to Lt. Finnerty “ . . . that element
of surprise that the audience likes
so much.”

Another new policy was to use
more swing music than has ever
been used in former years. Out-
standing swing selections were the
medley of “Blues In The Night,”
“Chattanooga Choo Choo,” “Saint
Louis Blues,” along with “Top Hat
White Tie and Tails,” and “Blue-
birds Over The White Cliffs Of
Dover” used in the Duke game.

One of the clevcrest maneuvers
was carried out at the Indiana
game. The theme of the routine
was the salute to the flag when
.120 small ﬂags were worn on the
caps of the bandsmen. It was also
during this routine that the band
made a cannon, complete with
moving wheels, and a recoil, that
made such a big hit with the stu-
dent bdoy. : -

Played during this performance
was “As The Caissons Go Rolling
Along,” and the first swing num-
ber, “I Left My Heart At The
Stage-Doo-r Canteen.”

Remembered by the students is
the “Hi Neighbor” routine of the
Pitt-Tech game. At this game the
band played “The Strip Polka” and
took oﬁ their overcoats to reveal
themselves wearing plaid shoulder
sashes \vhile spelling out “HOOT
MON” on the ﬁeld. When the band

fell into a ballet line that extended
the length of the ﬁeld the over-
coats were left spelling the words
“HOOT MON.”
l)uring the Southern Methodist
game the southerners were salut-
ed with a ten-gallon hat, a boot
and spur, a medley of cowboy
tunes and the song “1’ve Got
Spurs That Jingle Jangle Jinglef.’
At the Nebraska game tribute
was paid to the Red, White and
Blue with the band forming a red
cross, a white Christmas tree
complete with ﬁrework candles,
a blue star, a red white and blue
"V” and the official Pitt “P” that
was used in every Pitt game.
Playing with the hand this year
were approximately ﬁfty Freshmen
who were only recently formally
initiated into the organization.
These new men with the upper class
bandsmen celebrated the close of
the season with a banquet Tuesday
night at the Webster Hall hotel.
Featured at the banquet were
speakers from the various class
groups of the band and movies of
the season’s performances.

dies in Florida

Alumnus Killed
ln Auto Crash

Second Lieutenant RoyJ. Ru-ane.
of the U. S. Marines, last year’s
president of Student Faculty assem-
bly, was buried near his home last
Monday morning following fatal
injuries in an automobile accident
near Lee Field, auxiliary base of
the Jacksonville Naval Air Station,
Florida. B A

According to the navy’s report,
Lieutenant Ruane died after his
automobile overturned about one
and a half miles south of Lee Field.
He was alone at the time of the
accident.

A graduate of the College last
January, Lieutenant Ruane im-
mediately started training as a
naval air cadet. He received pre-
liminary training at Philadelphia
and Atlanta and later was ap-
pointed to the marine corps. Just
before his death, he had been
assigned to active duty as a
carrier ﬁghter pilot.

As a senior at Pitt, Lieutenant
Ruane was president of Phi Delta
Theta, and SFA. He was active on
the Pitt News, and worked for Pitt
Town In e e t in g , Interfraternity
"Council, and Freshman Camp. Dur-
-ing his junior year, he was an up-
perclass counsellor.

 Owl Extends

Picture Time
For Juniors

Because a two-day strike at Gim-
bel’s studios closed the studio to
juniors who wanted to have their

picture taken for the Owl, special
arrangements have been made for
advanced juniors to have their pic-.

tures taken Tuesday and Wednes-
day of next week.

All advanced juniors who will
graduate ’43
semester are thus given two more
days to have their photographs
taken for inclusion in the graduat-

from the summer

ing senior section of the yearbook.
Juniors who do not have their pic-
ture in the ’4-3 Owl will not be in-
cluded in the 1944 book.

A booth has been set up in the

ground floor elevator lobby where _

juniors may make a deposit of $2
and obtain a receipt entitling
them to have their picture taken.
James Hardie, circulation mana-
ger, explains that because of‘ the
short notice given juniors these two
additional days have been added.
Seniors may also take advantage of
this last opportunity to get their
picture in the yearbook.

. _ , Ohio State versus Pitt at the Stadium, December 31 will
lift the lid on the ﬁrst war-time basketball season in a quarter

"of agcentury, according to the 1942-43 schedule released last

week. The Buckeyes are the only non-eastern team on the

Pan_ther’s curtailed cage card.

_ Following the opening game with the Western Confer-
ence team, the Blue and Gold basketeers play 14 contests with

eastern opponents. There is a pos-
sibility that a game with Grove
City may precede the Ohio State
encounter.

Nothing is deﬁnite however, be-
cause of the diﬂiculty the teams will
‘face in traveling. Already three
games that had been carded by the

iCarlsonmen have been postponed.

G Pitt had been iduled to meet

Northwestern and Butler, Decem-
ber 19 and 21‘ respectively. These

games had to be canceled because
the two teams are governed by the
Western Conference and must face
only Conference teams this season.
A sch<~‘ ‘ad game with the Atlantic
City Army team carded for Feb-
ruary 11 was postponed by the
Army. A

Thus Pitt’s eleven man «team will
face a far different schedule than

_ they have had in former years. In
_ fact, the game with Army at West

Point, February 10, will provide
the Panther cagers with their long-
est trip of the season. -

At this writing‘, Tay Malarkey,
Bobby Artman, Paul Lohmeyer,
‘Johnny Swacus and Walt Jones
make up the first team. Malarkey
and Artman were ﬁrst stringers on
last season’s disappointing squad,
while Lohmeyer was the number
one reserve man. Swacus and Jones
.were both members of last’ year’s
team, but didn’t play much.

squad. The ﬁrst three were reserves
on last year’s outﬁt, while the last
three are up from last season’s
freshman team.

With little less than a month to
go before the season’s opening the
Panthers are playing a series of ex-
hibition games with local semi-pro
teams. In all the games the Blue
and Gold have demonstrated a scor-
ing punch that is sure’ to make
them a spectacular, if not an out-
standing team this year. In each of
the war*m—up tilts played they have
averaged over 50 points.

The players are all in favor of
the new “Blitz” system introduced
this season by. coach Carlson. The
system they’re using involves a fast
break with lots of passing. Only
possible problem in the present set-
up is the zone defense which many
teams used last season to complete-
ly bottle-up the Panther offense.

Traveling difficulties, a‘ small

squad, a curtailed schedule and pos-
sible loss of players to the armed
forces do not make the outlook too
bright for the coming season. One
thing is certain, however, and that
is that this year can’t be much
worse than last season when the
Panthers had one of their worst
campaigns. “so, every other cage
squad in the country is facing the
same problems that’ the Blue and
Gold . are encountering.
,.The schedule -is light and the
players like the new “blitz” sys-
tem of basketball. Maybe the Blue
and Gold can come back this year
and come through with a ﬁrst rate
campaign. Time will tell.

Bowser Declines Excuses’?  ii

Praises Minnesota, 0. S. 

By ELAINE KAHN

There really isn’t much you can
say or do about the 1942 Grid sea-
son except, maybe, forget about it.
But, anyway, we went up to get
Head Coach Charles Bowser’s opin-
ion on it all.

The coach, who announced that
his more immediate vocation was
recovering from the aforemention-
ed 1942 grid season, declined to
offer any excuses. “We just played
better teams,” he said. “In most
cases they were just a little too fast
and a little too good for us.”

Bowser had only praise for his
players. “They tried hard all sea-
son,”-he said. Everyone of them
gave his best and was in there try-
ing all the time.” As proof of this
the Coach cited the Penn State
game when the team, with absolute-
ly nothing to gain and worn out by
a long hard schedule, played a hang
up game of ball.

“We were in there all the
time,” said the Coach, “and if it
hadn’t been for the runback of
that kickoff for a touchdown, we
might have won.”

“Wild” Bill Dutton, the lone
bright spot of the campaign, won
unqualiﬁed praise from his coach.
“Bill is a great competitor,” he
stated. “He never gives up. He had
to do most of the work this year
and he did it well.” Particularly
pleasing to Bowser this year was
Dutton’s development as a passer
and punter.

The 50-7 defeat the Panthers
were handed by Minnesota's Gold-
en Gophers in the ﬁrst game of the
season was largely responsible for
the poor season that followed, ac-
cording to the Coach. “They got off
to a bad start and‘never did get

recalls hard-fought season

back on the right track,” he said.» 
The fact that Minnesota has \ 5
since lost four games is more ‘
than a little surprising to Bowser.
“When I saw them they looked M
like a truly unbeatable combina-  "'
tion. If they played against other
teams the way they played
against us I .don’t see how any-' =
one could beat them,” he added‘  .
ruefully. , ' . ‘
Coach Bowser did not have 
much to say about the 59-19 mas-'
sacre at Ohio tate_. “We. just [.
weren’t prepared to encounter a
game like that,” he said. They were’
superior in speed, and .manpower.'.
On the question of what the war -
is going to do to college football,» .,
the Coach said, “It’s all up tors:
Washington." His more immediate ‘T.
problem is transportation. He- came r I
to school from his Oakmont ‘homef '.
this morning via Greensburg. ' H

_ As a result of an assembly which met last Tuesday to
discuss the role of the college woman in the present crisis,
Women’s Self Government Association has drawn up a list
of suggestions which may be applied to activities for the

duration of the war.

The suggestions are embodied in
a resolution which also includes a
review of the wartime aims of wom-
en’s organizations on campus.

The resolution drawn up by the
VVomen’s Self Government Associa-
tion also urges all women’s organ-
izations to ﬁght against the pres-

.ent political situations on campus

and especially in SFA which it
terms “undemocratic, destructive
of unity and good will, inimical to

real student government and out of :

harmony with the ideals for which
we are all making sacriﬁces and
for which the men of the univer-
sity are being asked to risk their
very lives.”

It further suggests that to
save students time for war-im-
portant work, organizations cut
the number of meetings ﬁfty per
cent, that activity points be
raised for certain offices to limit
the extra-curricular work of stu-
dents; and that because of trans-
portation difﬁculties, meetings
should not be held in the evenings
if possible.

Among these aims are the follow-
ing: all freshman units will be or-
ganized to serve as integral parts
of the civilian defense of the Cathe-
dral, p_articularly as messengers.
Units will further serve in the war
effort in speciﬁc ways, viz: Acting
unit will present plays at hospitals,
schools, and for soldiers; Home
arts will bake cookies for army
Practical Mechanics will
'train women to do mechanical re-
pair work around the home for-
merly done by brothers or fathers;
Camera Arts will train women in
photography, which is required for
some work in the WAVES and
WAACS.

Included in the wartime plans

BETTY HALDEMAN
WSGA resolves . . .

of the activities groups is the
d e c i s i o n of the Employment
Council to make a complete sur-
vey of the undergraduate women
in order to list names of those
who can be placed or trained by
business or industry for the war
‘effort.
Major wartime change- listed
among the new suggestions is the
Inter-Class Sing which will be re-

placed by “Women’s Day” to be

held January 13.. The program on
this day will feature a mass meet-
ing on “College Women And The
War" with a nationally famous
speaker, and a series of vocational
conferences with speakers from the
ﬁelds in which there is urgent war
need for women. Deans will be re-
quested to excuse all women from
their sixth and seventh hours on
this day in order that they may at-
tend -these conferences.

Pitt Reaoly For Air   Raiols

;;:»».

  

C By‘ RUSSELL ROBINSON

University air raid protection has
developed from an investigating
committee into what is now con-
sidered to be perhaps the most ex-
tensive and eﬁective service of its
kind in American colleges.

After the British Air Raid Pie-
caution service had operated so
valiantly and successfully during
the battle for Britain, the adminis-
tration decided that a similar or-
ganization should be assembled
and put into operation.

A committee under the direction
of Dr. Einar W. Jacobsen, dean of
the school of education, was set up
to investigate and to make recom-
mendations for the installation of a
system of air raid protection.

After a period of investigation
the committee appointed Dr. John
J. Geise, associate professor of
history, as chief air raid warden

of the University. Dr. Geise was

empowered to select his assistants
and to put into operation a system
of air raid defense.

The military department under
the direction of Col. Edward L.
Kelly, professor of military science
and tactics, along with Dr. Geise
inspected the Cathedral and deter-
mined the places on each ﬂoor that
were the most bomb-proof. These
places were designated as shelter
areas.

It was decided that the classroom
would be the basic unit of all air
raid protection. Charts for each
room in the Cathedral that was in
use were drawn up. The instructor
in the class room was designated as
the warden of that room. He wa.s
made responsible for the evacua-
tion of the students in his class.

It was also his duty to appoint
a student lieutenant warden, who

of students, as well as several
students who were responsible for
closing the windows and blacking
out the rooms as much as possi-
ble. , l

A special set of evacuation
charts was drawn up for the eve-
ning school students.

The department of building and
grounds, under the direction of
superintendent Raymond L. Coss,
installed a system of emergency
lighting in the Cathedral, whereby
the entire building may be blacked
out from a single control switch.
After a slight delay because of a
lack of priority, twenty-three sirens
were procured and installed in the
Cathedral. These are in addition to
the two city sirens which were in-
stalled on the thirty-eighth ﬂoor of
the Cathedral by the Pittsburgh
branch of the Civilian Defense
C01pS. _

Warning is given in the various
other University buildings by the
operation of the class bells. All Uni-
versity buildings are connected with
the main office of" air raid protec-
tion in the Cathedral by a special
system of infra-building telephones.
Red blackout lights have also been
installed on each floor of the
Cathedral.

Upon the recommendation of
Mr. Roy Hadley, chief air raid
warden of Zone four in which the
University post is located, a ﬁre
watching post, manned by volun-
teer students and faculty mem-
bersxwas established on the roof
of the Cathedral. Dr. Benjamin J.
Williams, professor of political
science, is in charge of the fire
watching post.

There have been several air raid
