1» ably be sent to 0ﬂicer’s Naval
.._'I'raining.

1 ‘more year after which they will be_
' eligible, following an examination,
' for entance into V-12. V-1 is still

University Speech Contes
lnlormation, ls Released  

In cooperation with_several government agencies, a speech
contest for the promotion of inter-American aﬁairs is to be
conducted at the University during the latter part of March.

Subject of the contest is: “How
the American Republics are coop-
erating in winning the war.” It was
proposed and sponsored by the Of-
ﬁce of Coordination of Inter-Ameri-
can Affairs and the American Coun-
cil on Education. President Roose-
velt and other national ﬁgures have
given their endorsement to the con-
test.

The entrance procedure as outlin-
ed by Dr. Charles W. Lomas, head
of Men’s Debate, is as follows:

1. Secure a mimeographed sheet
giving details from teacher of his-
tory, English, political science,
speech, Spanish, or geography.

2. Submit a manuscript of a
speech to the person from whom you
get the rules. This speech will be on
the subject of the contest and will
have no more than one thousand
words. All sources of information
must be cited. _

3. Those submitting the best man-
uscripts will participate in an ex-
temporaneous speaking contest.
Two winners will ﬁnally be deter-
mined. ’

4. Deadline for submitting manu-
scripts will be March 26. The speak-
ing contest will be on or about April
10

This contest will be conducted
in conjunction with a Pan-Ameri-
can celebration to follow later in
April. Winners in the speaking
contest will participate in that
affair.

cups are still clinking when the
7:40 class begins. Pvt. Freeman
grabs his books and goes through
a conglomeration of medical aid,
history, and mathematics. This is
followed by a period of supervised
study, which simply means he
cannot fall asleep. At 11:40
o’clock, Pvt. Freeman beats his
way to the mess hall for chow. A
hurried smoke, an exchange of
gossip, and the lad in khaki is
once more wracking his brain.
This time it is in a military class
under officer instruction. A period
of study in quarters gives our
cadet an opportunity for forty
winks over an open text. At the
conclusion of classes at 2:50, he
indulges in a couple of hours of
calisthentics under merciless Pitt
instructors. Another hour of drill
in various military formations
round out the intensive course in
muscles. Pvt. Freeman wearily
mounts the Cathedral stairs for
his shower in preparation for
chow.

Six o’clock ﬁnds our hero again
playing the part of a gourmet.
He is at.liberty from 7 o’clock
until 9:45. During this time he
may visit the canteen (Tuck Shop
to you) or library for a couple
hours of leisure. Lights go out at

Coecls To Meet
Commander Hall

Today Pitt coeds will have the
opportunity to meet Wing Com-
monder Ashley Hall, of the British
Air Ministry, at 2:30 o’clock in
244 Cathedral. Following this meet-
ing, Miss Helen Pool Rush, Dean of
Women, and the girls will en-
tertain him in the Commons Room.

Later this afternoon, Wing
Commander Hall will address Air
Corps candidates in the Carnegie
Lecture Hall. His topic will be

“Pre-Entry Training for the
R.A.F.”
Before the war, Wing Com-

mander Hall was attached to the
Auxiliary Air Force. He has
served four years with a- bomber
squadron, and for the first six
months of the present war he was
in command of a balloon squadron
of the Royal Navy.

'_based on DuBose and

E , Many problems were presented with the coming of the
air corps cadets and not the least of which was the inevitable
"one of boy-rneets—girl. One of the first questions the cadets

[asked when they arrived at Pitt was “ls it coeducational.”
 This surprised no one, but the enthusiasm with which Pitt
A Women have greeted the arrival of the cadets has been little

short of amazing.

At present it is strictly a problem in hair line mathemat-
ics to ascertain just who is the pursuer and who the pursued.
Certainly neither primness nor reticence has been noted on

the part of Pitt’s young ladies. Indeedwhile their keen desire

to maintain the mora.le of the army has been heartening,it

-has also been disturbing to the men who must maintain the
‘discipline of the army.

Right now the cadets are in quarantine which means that

‘they are not allowed to have any associations with members
‘of the student body. But they are on guard duty, they do

Walk through the halls, and the co-eds do find ways of striking‘

I ‘ j up conversations with them.

There have also been instances of co—eds writing their
telephone numbers in lipstick on Tuck Shop tables just before

‘the cadets enter for their recreation period. Furthermore,

members of the army’s enlisted personnel are so overwhelmed
by feminine attentions when they are in the Tuck Shop that
they are reported seeking another place in which to eat.

' vNot that-the cadets have been particularly bashful or
backward in the matter. Several of them tossed a note from

‘the second ﬂoor onto the Common’s room where a group of

‘ girls were sitting. Written on it were the w-ords, “Will you

’ date us when the quarantine. is lifted? If yes, nod your head-;
‘ : if theanswer is no, run.” No one ran. _

The story is also told of the lonely sentry walking guard

  __jluty’)over.one of the restricted areas. A co-ed wandered along
' -‘ and the sentry made‘-it his duty to walkover to theyoungp lady
v’”a_nd inform her ofthe fact that she was approaching are-

Stamp and Banal   Committee

   Ca” For More Salesmen

Weekly stamp and bond sales have been declining recently.

Last week the stamp and

bond drive committee met to

’ consider the reasons for this decline in sales volume. Their con-

clusion was that the present lack of competent salesmen has
combined with several incidental factors in undermining the

, sales effort.

Harriet R. Glasser, assistant

dean of women, replaces Theodore

W. Biddle, dean of men as admin-
istrative adviser.

Holding to the assumption
that “The best students of all
move to old State Hall,” the
committee has designated an en-
tire sub-committee to, handle the
sales program in State Hall. Pres- '
ent plans call for a new red, white,
and blue booth to be set up on
the ﬁrst ﬂoor in the here-to-for
exclusive domain of the engineers.
Erma Block, Ed44, and Anita\Al-
man, C45, have full charge of this

' - . new booth, which will be operated

as entirely separate from the booth
in the Cathedral. The new booth will
be open from 9:30 until 3:30 o'clock.

‘A call has been issued for more

salesmen, by chairman Ruth Becker,_
4 Ed44, who urges those interested to

see her or Miss Glasser immediate-
ly. Freshmen are eligible. Students
who have free hours in_the morning

* or who have classes‘ in State Hall
are urged to help.

The totals since October have
passed the $14,000 mark’ already,

_ ‘with Alpha Epsilon Phi, women’s

social fraternity, adding a good
share of that amount last Wednes-
day. Next Wednesday, Zeta Tau
"Alpha will help the committee with
sales.

 

Men’: Council

Appoints New
Committees

At a dinner meeting held last
Monday at the Royal York, Men's
Council appointed several commit-
tees to deal with campus problems.

Art Thomson, C43; Bob Art-
man, Ed43, and Creighton Mc-
Clintock, C43, were appointed to
investigate the possibilities of ob-
taining a cheaper streetcar fare
from the Cathedral to Shadyside.
Many students have not been able
to get to classes on time because
of the long walk. The desired fare
for a round trip would be five
cents.

A morale committee consisting of
Stephen Miketic, E43; Kenneth
Fegley, E45, and John Patterson,
M44, was also appointed. It is the
purpose of this committee to try to
convince the increasing number of
science students joining the armed
forces'that theirplace is on “the
home front.”

It was decided to suspend Honor
Court for this semester because of
the lack of eight week grades and
a customs program.
