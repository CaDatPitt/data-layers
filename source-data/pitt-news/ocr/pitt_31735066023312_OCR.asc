Food Service Comes Under Scnrtiny of Task Force  

By BOB WARMKESSEL
Pitt News Staff Writer

A task force of Resident Student
Association Food Service Com-
mittee members, Student Govern-
ment Board members and organ-
izers of the recent food service
petition drive will meet next week
to draw up a list of cafeteria
problems to submit to the food
service management for their
response.

Stan Heleniak, chairman of the‘
RSA Food Service Committee, and
‘Kim Watterson, SGB' member,
agreed to the formation of the task
force at last night’s regular

meeting of the committee in the
Tower A conference room.

Watterson said the idea for a-
task force was suggested by Dr.
John Vrana, an assistant to the vice
chancellor for" business. '

- “Dr. Vrana suggested we form
this committee not as if we are
pressured to make complaints, but
if ‘there are situations in the
cafeteria that need attention, we
should address them in the
committee,” said W atterson.

The committee will discuss
various complaints that have been
voiced by students in recent weeks,
such as foreign objects in food, lack

of enough glasses and silverware,

‘and lukewarm food, according to

Wattersonl. These complaints, if
considered valid by the committee,
would be submitted in writing to
the food service management.

“This will be a mechanism to set
things on paper,” said Watterson.
‘-‘After we complete the list of
problems (in the cafeteria) and give.
it to the food service, we would
expect some kind of answer to each
specific problem—if you (the food
service) can‘ solve a problem, and if
so, when.” '

‘A proposal by WPGH Radio to

build an FM radio station at Pitt ~_

will be forwarded by the Office for
Student Affairs to Senior Vice
Chancellor‘ Jack Freeman next
week,’ according to Andy Smith,
‘director of the Office of Student
Activities.
Smith made the announcement
Thursday at a biweekly meeting of

‘ the Student Affairs Advisory

Committee.

_ “Dr. Freeman -will make a
recommendation to Chancellor
Posvar based on the merit of the
proposal and availability of funds, ’ ’

' Smith said.

WPGH operates through a
carrier current, a system of

 

telephone lines and small twenty-
watt transmitters located in Pitt’s
resident halls. Only the resident
halls can receive the station’s
broadcasts.

Before Pitt can send an
application for an FM license to the
Federal Communication Commis-
sion in Washington, Carnegie-
Mellon University must agree to
change its station’s frequency so
that a Pitt-owned station would not
interfere with C-MU’s broadcasts,
according to Dan Shalenko, WPGH
general manager.

If C-MU agrees to change its
frequency, a -consulting firm, in
Boston ‘will _ prepare ‘an FCC
application for a-construction
permit which the commission must

   

approve before Pitt_ can build‘ its 1

station, Shalenko said after the
meeting. .. ..

Shalenko told the committee

the university must _make a-

decision soon on whether to 
the new radio facility.

“We must resolve it (whether to
build a new station or not),”
Shalenko said. “Alf it is decided to
scrap the FM station, we must
pump some money into the carrier
current station (WPGH).”

“As it stands now, everything at
the carrier current station is old,”
Shalenko added.

Conney Kimbo, vice chancellor
for student affairs, said the
university’s, decision to build a new

station will probably be contingent 1'

“If the proposal is. rejected, and
that_’_s ajppssibility, it is because

’,there are no available dollars to

fund it,”; Kirnbo said.

The university will try to come to
a decisi_o_n- on the proposal before
January, Kimbo said.

In other business, Smith report-
ed that the Student Union
renovation proposal is being
reviewed by various members of

, the university’s senior staff.

The renovation project will" cost
an estimated $10.5 million.

of Trustees, may provide $4 million

On the face of it, the Administration appears to be
performing a service to the student body by looking
into the organizations’ complaints about the
allocations process.. It ‘seems every year there are

~ complaints aboutthe process that are not answered

sufficiently by SGB or the university administration.
‘ owever, a closer look "at the situation reveals-several
‘uestionabl‘e practices in the investigation.

First, Kimboand Andy Smith, director of student -

activities and chairman of the review committee, will

. not reveal the nature of the charges involved. Kimbo

said he would not publicly list the complaints because
it would be unfair to the. review committee and the

public to do so until the committee completes its ‘”

work.

We strongly disagree. '

The charges should be aired publicly now, not
later. The allocations process involves the
appropriation of thousands of dollars obtained from
students through their activities fee. It seems terribly
unfair to hide the charges from the student body
when it is the allocation of their money to various
student organizations that is being probed.

To compound the problem, the proceedings will be

held behind closed doors—students may not witness

the investigation of how their money is spent.

' Obviously, this means the media are_ also barred from

the committee proceedings and are unable to report
the group’s deliberations to the students. °

The entire proceeding is shrouded in secrecy for
reasons that are not clear.

What is clear is that Smith appears to be reneging
on his promise of an open Office of Student

I Activities, an office where students know‘ what is‘
He made that promise

being done_ at all times.
publicly in, August after assuming his duties as
director. . ‘

The entire situation is in line with what seems to be
the university’s policy of institution major policy
changes when students are not on campus, making
decisions without proper student input and generally
ignoring student needs. A

When will the administration learn their policies
and decisions directly affect students’ lives? In the
case of the Allocations Review Committee, the
process and funds involved are both. administered
and suppliedby students, yet only four students

' (review committee members) will have complete

knowledge of the investigation at all times.
The Allocations Review Committee’s proceedings

should be opened to the public to provide a potential -

student check on the investigation. Students should
demand that the committee's proceedings be open.

If the office for Student Affairs and the Office of
Student Activities‘ refuse, all findings of the review

committee should be rejected until all students are.

Page 6—Friday, October 26, 1979 ‘?‘r

' By JEFF DUROSKO

Asst. Pitt News Sports Editor .
It's possible that the Pitt
women's volleyball team might

have -a big problem this weekend at’

"the Maryland Invitational,. a
problem not shared by many teams
‘across the country. It’s a task of
gearing up for a tournament full of
weaker teams.»
' “I expect, that our biggest
problem will be keeping our
concentration,” said head coach
Mike Hebert. “We won't be
pushed like we wee by the teams in
California and Texas." V

The Pantherettes enter Friday's
competition‘ with a record of
21-14-3 after and easy victory
Wednesday over Slippery Rock
15-3, 15-3, 15-12. Freshman Ellen
Mangus started the match at the
setter position in place of Maria
Perez, who was ill.

“In terms of the freshmen, Ellen
did a great job along with Tina
Newton and Julie Gaul, who both
had a better than usual match,”
said Hebert.

Part of the Pantherettes’ prob-
lem this season is that after playing
a tough team like Houston on the

road, they must return home to-

play Slippery Rock or Edinboro-—-a
great letdown.

“I’m frightened because our
team seems to play very well
against stronger competition,” the
coach said. “But, we have
problems with teams that are
weaker, but really emotional and
geared up for the contest.”

In Pitt's loss to Ohio State. last
Saturday, the Pantherettes lacked
the emotion necessary in a big
game like that one, according to
Hebert.

“This week in practice, the team
showed much more emotion than in
past weeks,” he said. “And what
we need is less technique and more
emotion.”

The Maryland Invitational will be
a 20-team tournament with Pitt in a
pool with West Virginia, Rhode
Island, George Washington, and
North Carolina State, four of the
‘weaker teams in the tournament.

Among the stronger teams‘ in the
tournament are Rutgers, Maryland
and Georgetown. These teams will
all be looking to" knock off the
high-ﬂying Pantherettes, as Pitt
has yet to lose to an Eastern squad.

“This is an important tourna-
ment,” said Hebert, “in that we
need a win to help solidify our
standing as the No. 1 team in the
East and to get a good seed in the
regional tournament.”

  Superior Nittany Lion

By ANNA ARLOTTA

" Another Pitt-Penn State battle
-occurred Tuesday when the cross-
state rivalry was played soccer
style at State College. The Nittany
Lions have dominated Pittfor the
past decade (although Pitt had a
2-1 upset win last year) and this
year’s contest was no exception.
-The Panthers were bombed 6-0.

Although the Panthers’ efforts to

A win were evident throughout the

game, the team was totally
outclassed on the ﬁeld. The
superiority of the Penn State soccer
program was...'...exernplified from

beginning to end. Penn State came
equipped with everything from an
All-American midfielder, Jim
Stamatis, (who, assisted on three of
Penn State’s goals and scored one
himself) to Peter Jancevski, who
scored four of the Nittany Lion
goals. '
The initial Penn State goal came
with only three minutes gone in the
ﬁrst half after Panther sweeper
Tom Liebenguth was called for a
personal foul within the Penn State
penalty area. Stamatis. took the
penalty kick and scored to put the

Nittany Lions up 1-0. The game

 

Pitt spikers (pictured here left to right) Robin Kuklais, Kathy Sonricker, Andy Pletz and Paula Olsen all contributed to last

I

night's defeat of a weak Slippery Rock team.

Boaters Down Rival Panthers, 6-0    

could have ended at that point, ’

because the Panthers were unable
to score a goal all night.

With only ﬁve minutes gone in
the game Panther defender Tom
Kunkel, who had been hampered
with a calf injury, was ‘sent to the
bench after reinjuring the calf.
Kunkel satout the rest of the game
and found out later that the injury
was more seriousthan expected. A
torn muscle in Kunkel’s left leg will
knock him out of competition for
the remainder of the Panthers
games.— Also slightly injured ,was

Panther defender Jerry Tomasetti.

‘ ‘With Tom out and Jerry injured

_we may have a tough time

defeating the remainder of our
opponents,” said ‘Panther wing
Eric Tiedtke. “We know that Tom
will be out for the rest of the season
but we aren’t sure yet on the
severity of J erry’s injury.

-“Our defense has played just
great all season long and it’s just
too bad that something like this
had to happen to them,” Tiedke
added. ‘

Tiedtke and midfielder Troy
Norton also suffered slight injuries
in the contest. ’

A  Pitt Spikers Need More Emotion For Maryland llllin

;

Penn State ended the half up 2-0 ,
after Bob McDonald scored the ,

second goal of the game. With only 

four minutes gone in the second .
half Jancevski and Stamatis com-
bined for their ﬁrst of three goals
together. After J ancevski put a hat
trick under his belt, he added one
more goal to put him up to four on
the night. With 10 minutes left in
the game, Steve Bloominthal
scored the ﬁnal Nittany Lion goal.
Pitt’s next contest will certainly
be no easier than the Penn State '
game, as the Panthers will leave

= today to travel to Lock Haven.

Beaver Native   BobPowers to Quarterback Navy ,1?

Tomorrow’s Pitt-Navy game will be a home-

i coming for two of the starting 11 on the Midship-
; men. Quarterback Bob Powers hails from Beaver,
~. Pennsylvania, while offensive guard Frank
, McCallister is from local high school power Penn
Hills. ,
v -Powers, a senior who had seen little action at
jiquarterback while record-setting Bob Lesczynski led
" the Middies to a couple of big-winning seasons, is
;; said to be a better runner than thrower. At 6-foot-4,
1.1207 pounds, Powers would seem to have the ideal
build for a great passer, but his running ability is
";-more renowned. ‘ ’
Overall, Navy Coach George Welsh has been satis-
fied with Powers’ performance.

V “Our problems with the" passing game early this
. season were not all his fault,” Welsh said. “Don’t
§ forget, we were starting over in that area. We had
f lost the receivers- too. '

“He threw extremely well -in the
 second half against Virginia.” ,
‘ Welsh was referring to last week’s game at
. Annapolis, when the unheralded but vastly improved
Virginia Cavaliers had Navy tied 10-10 with only a
few minutes left to play. Powers completed eight of
. 12 passes in the second half and directed the game-
P winning drive «in 2:06, scoring the winning
touchdown himself with 1:20 left on a six-yard run

around the left end.

u ; “Bob looks. improved: with his passing no- H
j’ Welsh‘ added.

Instant, Replay

By SAMUEL SCIULLO

Becausemany teams have found running the ball

‘difficult against the Pitt defense. the Middies may be

forced to put the ball in the air more than they have
all year. Although Welsh insisted his team intends to
run the ball against the Panthers,’ Powers said he and
his receivers will be ready to use the passing game if
necessary.

“I think our passing offense is picking up now,”
Powers said. “We weren’t'putting it up a whole lot

‘in some early games. But I'm more confident with

my passing now. Also, I’m not running out of the_
pocket like I had a tendency_to do at times. I think I
gave up on receivers too soon. Some of this was all a
matter of time for some of us to get the feel for if.”

Itilttltllltlllkllllll

Now that the season has passed the halfway point,
bowl fever is starting to hit the college football scene.
Representatives from the Qrange, Gator and Holiday
bowls will be among the scouts at Pitt Stadium for
the game tomorrow. They will be keeping a keen eye

on both Pitt and Navy. The winner of tomorrow’s -

game could go on to finish/as the top team in the
East.

"III*******

This column reported several weeks ago that
“Tiger” Paul" Auslancief had de'cided”tof;__pack his 3
bags and head for Las Vegas. But public outcry
against Tiger leaving has been so great that he has

decided against moving, and will remain in Pitts-1:

burgh for many more years.

But, according _‘to ‘Tiger, he ‘is undecided on
whether or not he will ‘be back at the field house to
lead the Pitt student section in cheering. Nobody can
excite a Pitt crowd the way Tiger can, so if fan
response isn’t all it should be at Pitt basketball
games, Tiger may pop up towards the middle of the
season, just in time to bring the Panthers down the
home stretch’ of the Eastern Eight race.

****I|I*I|I*

In all probability, the Pitt-Penn State game, sched-

uled for Saturday, Nov. 24 at,Beaver Stadium, will“

be moved back one week, to Saturday, Dec. 1. This
