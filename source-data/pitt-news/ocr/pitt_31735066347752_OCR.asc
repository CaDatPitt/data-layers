Posvar Grants Nyden Review Penn Sidie FOCUHY

By MREA CSORBA‘

Chancellor Wesley Posvar, after
weeks of buffered silence on the
cases of professors Paul Nyden and «-
Yusef Ali, took action yesterday on a
number of demands made by the
two professors and their supporters
during recent demonstrations.

- In ahand-delivered letter, Posvar
notiﬁed assistant sociology profes-
sor Nyden that his appeal for a
review before a University Senate
Council hearing board has been
granted, with the hearing proce-
dures to begin next Wednesday.

A Responding to black studies
professor , Ali’s request for a
personal review, the Chancellor met
with Ali yesterday morning and
with black studies department
chairman Curtiss Porter in the
afternoon. Both meetings wereat
the request of Ali.

Pressured by requests from the
Student Committee to Defend Dr.
Paul Nyden and Yusef Ali‘
concerning the teachers’ termina-
tion, effective April 30, Posvar also
agreed to meet with six representa-
tives from the committeeyto discuss
the procedures involved in Nyden’s
case. The Chancellor, however,
stated in his letter that it would not
be appropriate for him to discuss

the merits or the substances of the
sociologist’s case while under
review.

The meeting was set for next
Tuesday.

The Nyden and Ali supporters
were informed of these develop-.
ments yesterday outside the
Chancellor’s office, where about 20
of them gathered forwhat was the
third planned sit-in on the
Chancellor’s office in as many
weeks.

Last week’s scheduled sit-in was
thwarted by locked doors and
campus police who were stationed
outside the Chancellor’s office.
Two weeks ago, some five
demonstrators occupied Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome
Rosenberg’s conference room for
about an hour, and the Chancel-
lor’s‘off1ce for about three hours,
demanding more student input into
University ﬁring and hiring pro-
cedures.

Yesterday, campus police once
again blocked the students seeking
to enter Posvar’s office, where an
honors reception was about to
begin. The Chancellor’s scholars
and twenty-five winter-term

undergraduate. teaching fellows
were present for a coffee hour

Questions concerning grad-
uate employe unionization, the
proposed, townhouses and lack of
University services were raised at
the Graduate and Professional
Students Association (GPSA) meet-
ing Monday with Chancellor
Wesley Posvar and Provost Rhoten
Smith.

At the meeting, which was the -
first of a series of meetings.planned
between GPSA and members of
Pitt's administration, GPSA mem-
ber William Voharas questioned
and Smith about the
proposed townhouses and thenuse
of Bruce Hall. 

He asked for answers to
questions‘ concerning who will
occupy those residences and when
such decisions will be made.

“Over 200 -graduate students lost
housing on campus last year and
they haven’t gotten it back yet,”
Voharas said.

Addressing Voharas’ questions,
Smith said, “The chancellor, in
conjunction with his senior staff,
will decide who will occupy the
townhouses.

“Housing has always been a
trouble spot," Posvar said. “We
were stymied by federal funding
and community opposition, as well
as by Pittsburgh city government
itself. Even if we have majority
support and a small but vocal group

_ feels threatened, that group can

sway a planning group if it is the
style ofwthe planning group to bend
to opposition."

In other business, Faculty of Arts’
and Sciences—Graduate Student
Organization (FAS-GSO) Repre-

sentative and Union of Graduate.

Employes (UGE). member Bob
Nelson reminded the Chancellor of
the results of the recent FAS-GSO-
sponsored mock election in which
graduate employes voted over-
whelmingly in favor of unionization
and a commitment made by
Posvar. In an earlier statement,
Posvar said that if any sector of the
University was confrontedby the
question of unionization, the
decision must be made by that
constituency.

Posvar said, “TAs and TFs are I

classified in Pennsylvania as being
primarily students. Until_the law
changes, I am not morally or legally
committed to - abide by these
results.”
earlier statements made by Posvar
concerning the election results.

Reading a prepared statement, V

GPSA member Adrienne Kaltman
voiced complaints about Pitt's
library system.

Kaltman said there is a lack of
phone lines for reference use in
Hillman Library. Presently, only
one phone, which is located inside
the library's ground floor entrance,
is available for dialing within the
University community.

She also said more certiﬁed
librarians should be assigned to
weekend and evening duty.

Smith agreed to “look into the
problems with the library system."

Kaltman also voiced the need for
increased advertising of materials

“There are many things avail-
able to both, graduate students and
undergrads, but they just don’t
know about them.”

Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Representative Dave Botto said
there is a lack of a University-wide
placement service and the need for
an overall coordinator of placement
for graduate students.

 

Rejects Unionization

UNIVERSITY PARK——Penn

‘ State University faculty rejected

unionization by an overwhelming
margin last Friday.

According to university officials,
1,712 of the 2,854 voting faculty
members cast their ballots for No
Representation while 642 chose the
Pennsylvania State Educational
Association (PSEA) affiliate, ‘the
Penn State Professional Associa- ,
tion. Five hundred cast their votes
for the American Association of
University Professors(AAUP).

‘Of the three state-related univer-
sities in Pennsylvania, Pitt, Penn
State and Temple, the latter
successfully unionized its faculty in
1973. Temple also was the first
large university in the state to
unionize. AAUP serves as its
representative in collective (bar-

under a four-year contract ‘and,

Temple’s news and public relations
department said, “some -— of my
faculty friends say the union doesn’t
do anything for assistant profes-
sors. Full professors don’t bother
to join the union. It’s certainly not
doing much for women. But there
certainly isn’t much dissension
concerning the union.”

. A year ago in March, Pitt faculty
members also rejected unioniza-
tion. The Pitt Professional Union
(PPU) took the runoff election spot
in the faculty elections early in the
month, narrowly defeating AAUP
by a margin of 11‘votes.

In the Provost’s area, the medical

school faculty voted to unionize ,
while the law school and graduate S

schools of health rejected unioniza-
tion. Since the No Representative
ballot option in the Provost’s area

_ received a simple majority (50 .

percent plus one vote), a runoff ‘

election was held between No
Representative and PPU, which
garnered the second, highest
number of votes. ‘
Provost area faculty rejected
unionization with 60 percent of its
votes cast for No Representation.

ti-Ieolth Fee  

Full-time School‘ of General 

Studies (SGS) students narrowly

approved the institution of a $16 I

per year health care fee during the
recent SGS Student Cabinet Coun-
cil elections.

The fee, in its first year, is
optional for part-time students and
mandatory for all full-time stud-

ents, except those enrolled in SGS. A

Full-time SGS students were
denied the health service option

when over 90 per cent of the SGS 

students surveyed indicated they
‘did not desire a health fee option.
Consequently, «full-time SGS stud-

ents were excluded from health .

center insurance services.
SGS President John Della Valle,
who was inaugurated last night,

said the council will be investigat-.

ing the issue further and possibly
issuing a full-scale referendum to
gather a broad-scale opinion on
instituting the health fee option.
Approximately six per cent of the
SGS student body voted in the
recent election.

Of the 144 full-time SGS voters
who answered the questionaire
issued during the cabinet elections,
54 percent favored the institution of
a mandatory health fee.

Approximately 43 percent of the
part-time students approved the
institution of a mandatory health
fee, with the remainder indicating

a preference for the option they

have now.

MINIMUM WAGE TUG-OF-WAR

WASHINGTON. AP¥As Presi-
dent Carter and organized labor
push their opposing views of how
high the minimum wage should be
raised, House Speaker Thomas P.
O’Neill predicted there will be a
compromise “somewhere in the‘
middle."

The minimum wage currently is
$2.20 an hour. The AFL-CIO had
advocated raising this to $3 .an hour
this year. The Carter administra-
tion has endorsed a $2.50 mini-
mum.

O’Neill said Carter spent a lot ‘of

time at a meeting yesterday with
congressional leaders talking about
inflation and how any large
increase in the minimum wage
would aggravate inflation.
, O’Neill said Carter told the
leaders he was going “to the
people” on the subject of inflation
after he is ﬁlled in by his Cabinet
advisors on the details of inﬂation’s
impact.’ ,

O’Neill

said Carter did not

indicate he was in a mood to

compromise on the minimum wage
issue. But he added, “Somewhere
aldng the line there will be a
minimum wage increase. And you
can almost‘ bet it will be somewhere
in the middle...a compromise
between the two."

STEEL APPEAL REJECTED

WASHINGTON (AP)——The
Supreme.Court has turned down an
appeal from the Bethlehem Steel
Corp. aimed at forestalling com-
pliance with air quality standards
at the ﬁrm’s Johnstown, Pa., plant.

The A justices refused without
comment Monday to hear argu-
ments by Bethlehem Steel that the
state Department of Environmental
Resources should not be permitted
to enforce a pollution-abatement
rule while that rule is being
challenged.

The Pennsylvania Supreme
Court ruled last November that the
state agency had such authority,
and the court's action Monday left
that ruling intact.

In 1972, the company ‘and
Pennsylvania authorities reached
an air pollution abatement agree-
ment concerning emissions from
Bethlehem’s' coke ovens at Johns-
town and Bethlehem, Pa. O

Among other things, the agree-
ment provided for the closing down

LEGIONNAIRES’ DISEASE
IMMIGRATES TO MICHIGAN

LANSING, Mich. (AP)—An
apparent case of ’ Legionnaires’
disease in Flint, Mich. is the second
Michigan case and the ﬁfth in the
nation discovered since the myster-
ious organism was identiﬁed in
January, a federal scientist said
yesterday.

All were isolatedvictims who had
no connection with the mysterious
outbreak of the disease in
Philadelphia last July, said Dr. Ted
Tsai, a federal Center for Disease
Control (CDC) epidemiologist in
Atlanta. S Tsai worked on the
Philadelphia case.

The sporadic cases tend to
support the theory that the
organism linked to the deaths of 29
persons connected with an Ameri-
can Legion convention in Philadel-
phia is “more common than we
think,” Tsai said.

Michigan health ofﬁcials dis-
closed yesterday that an organism
similar to the Legionnaires’ disease

had been identiﬁed in the case of a .

39-year-old woman who died of
pneumonia in Flint, Mich., on Dec.
31. The woman’s identity was
withheld by health officials at the
family’s request.

Tsai said the organisms in the
Flint case and in recently-discov-
ered cases in Detroit, Vermont,

Indiana and California are “related .

or identica ” to the one in
Philadelphia last July.

and Porter with the Chancellor, the
granting of Nyden’s appeal for a
hearing, and the proposed meeting
of the Chancellor with six students

from the group dispersed most of

the ralliers.

Nyden, who had not accompanied
the group to the planned disruption
of the honors program, as he had
done on the previous demonstra-
tions, responded favorably to the
Chancellor’s granting of his appeal,
but criticized the main focus of the
hearing as outlined in a seven-point
delineation of issues drawn by
members of the Chancellor’s staff.

“Every issue here, concentrates
on the fairness of previous review
proceedings,” he said. “My
scholarly work is the key question.
If the board doesn’t address that
issue, then they’ll come to the same

conclusion the previous ﬁve did.”

Nyden also criticized the proce- ’

dural tenets which speciﬁed that
each party may select three
observers of the hearings. ~ The

sociology professor had ‘requested ‘

the hearing to be public.

In regards to his morning
meeting with the Chancellor, Ali,
too responded favorably to the show
of University initiative. .“It’s the

professor said. “He (Posvar) is

Task Force Needed

The administration’s newly formed task force, charged with the
examination of the black student situation at Pitt is a committee

whose formation is long overdue.

No serious investigations or recommendations have been made
concerning the improvement of black student conditions at Pitt in
many a month. This resulted in a sit-in last term by black students
during a Student Government Board meeting, at which ‘time
demands were presented to draw attention to the plight of the

minority student.

It is easy to be optimistic about the possible success of the task

The real judge of success is results.

V" the problems can be viewed from the level at which they occur,
instead of from the ivy towers of academe.

And the investigation’s

results will depend on how’ vigorously it is willing to delve into

the needs of the black students.

A prime target is the eroding emphasis given the black
studies department. It’s bad enough a number of black students
have dropped out due to a series of tuition hikes, buljo Clltback the

more for less.

It is up to the task force to decide the level of emphasis that the
black studies department is to be given, and recommend ways to

raise the department to this level.

A related question is the non-renewal of instructor Yusef Ali’s

teaching contract.

The task force can answer once and for all

whether his non-renewal was due to lack of scholarly effort or an
attrition effort on the part of the administration. ;

These and other questions face the task force: Even if they
answer all of them the final responsibility rests on the
administration. . They must implement recommendations the task
force makes in order to improve the lot of the black. student at Pitt.

  Pitt and the Art of Confusion 

By VINCE ROBERTSON

There must be a master
stratagem in the art of confusion
i.e., “harass them, harass them,
make them relinquish control.”
And if such a device of schemes is in
force, Pitt must be the proving
grounds.» This personal conclusion
comes from quiet observation of Pitt
activities——observationi that impli-
cates a destructive social environ
which ranges from the Board of
Trustees all the way down to a
mediocre student body.

My observations have convinced
me that the only resolve of issues on
campus are the caprice of an

other people. As far as offensive
knowledge is concerned, what is
more offensive than the truth?
Conversely, administrative mani-

  Notes For an April Graduate

By ROSCOE DANDY

Graduation is a time of beginning
and reflection. There is warm
reﬂection in the fact that onehas
endured setbacks and trials and
tribulations in the pursuit of an
education. There is a feeling of
academic accomplishment in know-
ing thatthose rigorous four years
are ﬁnally paying off. On the other
side of the coin, graduation is a
beginning; it is a ticket to bargain
with.

I If my son or daughter “were
matriculating, “Notes to a Grad-
uate” would seek to devise a plan of

machine, I am also the first person
to attack it when I feel leary of its
actions. Needless to say, I feel leary
of Pitt’s administrative actions. I
believe it is a shrewd machine that
not only has abandoned its
obligation to the principles of
academic freedom but blatantly
distorts and deﬁes those principles,
which are the only justification for
the existence of a “liberal arts”
institution.
The primary result of this power
clique is this fact: no student
movement is powerful enough to

change an administrative decision, '

unless the administration throws it
out as an intentional ruse or decoy.
During the normal course of a
school term, the administration only
has to procrastinate on the issues at
hand, because the problems wil be
miraculously solved over the
summer break. It might be a
different story if the student body
was in full session on a year-round
basis. Then an issue could survive
long enough for an honest resolve.
But note I said “might.” Again,
might, because this part of the issue
and its resolve is contingent on the
attentiveness/ acumen of the stu-
dent body.

Can a mediocre student body be
effective? If (and only if) it is
aroused on a mass level to the point
of marked violence, and the issue
that would be able to do it would be
unworthy of the effort given it. Do
not take the statement as a joke or a
vicious slash. My point centers on a
fact of dupery. Namely, this
mediocrity I speak of is just the right
kind for building a dictatorship—in
Pitt’s case, administrative control of
knowledge and ideology, but in a
less speciﬁc case a control of
society.

Thus it has come to pass that a
well-oiled administrative machine
chosen by a more well-oiled board of

(Continued on Page 5)

perfectibility for their success. In a
sense, the message would involve a
mental ﬂight down endless corri-
dors of no exit signs encompassing
interacting patterns of life chances
intermixed with bait, choice and
uncertainty. I would tell him/ her to
challenge life's uncertainties by
setting goals in seven areas:
personal, family, ﬁna cial, educa-
tional, career, avocational and
spiritual.

SOARING

The time is now to make your
mark. The sky’s the limit. The
degree you have earned grants you
a license to soar to paths yet
unknown. Strive toward educa-

 tional and avocational goals. If you

aim high now, the certainty of
bumps, bruises and setback may be
alleviated. For example, this is the
most opportune ‘time to enter
graduate school. Such an
educational goal leads to reﬁne-
ment and focusing of skills in a
chosen area of study. Invaluable.
Beyond this goal, search for a
constructive hobby that will in-
crease in appeal as the years go by.
Avocational goal attainment is most
signiﬁcant when it is purposeful,

long living and costless. Gardening I

is a good example. Beyond botany’s
photosynthesis explanation, did you
ever wonder why a plant grows?
One can literally spend a lifetime
pursuing this puzzle and it’s
exciting because the endeavor
provides one with oxygen,‘purpose-
ful conduct and an endless array of
seeds to explore. Soar high.

LIFEUNFAllt

_ It is well to remember you were
not promised a rose garden and may
well be approaching a thorn bush.
Such a defensive orientation
cushions one for the imperfections"
in men, correlated with a lack of
certainty, insecurity and a search
for purpose in life. Three areas of
unfairness are employment, health
care and crime. “I would say,”
Paul Goodman notes in “Growing
Up Absurd,” “there is less to do in
society today. There are less jobs
and more people. With nothing to
do, one feels that they are indeed
nothing. Call it alienation.”

What about unfair health care? I
would note the report of the health
care policy advisory center on “The
American Health Empire.” The
report states that it’s costly to
become ill. It may well be too
expensive to die. The lack of quality
care for the uninsured reaches
astronomical proportions of $200-
plus per day for hospital care.
Added to this reality is unfair

victimization‘ in an ever increasing
crime-focused environment. Since
there is nothing to do for so many
young people, they react and
protest by way of random crime on
persons and property. The FBI
“Uniform Crime Reports” brings
this point home. Instant examples:
violent crimes (murder, rape,‘
assault) occurs every 30 seconds,
murder occurs every 25 minutes,
burglary “every 10 seconds and
robbery every 75 seconds.

In sum, I would say this trifold
unfairness could be challenged by
ﬁnance and career goals. One must
achieve. We are all participants in
this unfair world and consequently
at one point or another will be
affected by its aimlessness, illness
and crime. It seems to me that the
closest one can come to an immunity
system to this unfairness’ is by
having sound planning and training
leading to polished ﬁnancial and
career tools for survival.

ON YOUR OWN

-When you fall no one will be there
to catch you. You have to pass this
examination alone. Herein would
be my warmest words.

I would say, I cannot guarantee
you a success formula, nor can I
, prevent your failure. One has to
have the desire to steer his own
boat. Therefore, try and steer it in
the achievement of these goals:
personal, family, spiritual. These
are special goals because one has
maximum control here. They
cannot be realized on a time table
basis for they are ever evolving, in
need of revision at the 25th, 30th,
40th, 55 and 70th years. It is not
important that you do well in all
three goal areas. Rather, the
important thing is to begin with an
earnest heart and desire to do well.
Finally, notes to a graduate would
conclude: I did not make this
corrupt world of evil men. But I do
know this: if one has faith,
patience, constancy of pufpose,
consistency and moderation, there
is no conceivable way one can fail.
Time is your ally.

More On Comp
Sci TA List Q

In the March 30 issue of the Pitt
News, there appeared a letter
entitled “Why Couldn’t I Vote?”
from a teaching fellow in the
computer science department. This
letter stated that this person was
barred from voting in the FAS-GSO
mock election on unionization and
drew conclusions concerning the
reasons for this. The present letter
is intendedto clear up théiconfusion
surrounding this particular problem
by showing that the conclusions
reached were erroneous /because
they were based on misinformation.
To state my intention jn a
vernacular with which Mr. Quayle,
the computer science TF, might be’
more familiar, I will illustrate that
his letter is a case of “garbage in,
garbage out.’Z

— 1) The UGE is not the FAS-GSO.
Mr. Quayle implies that this is not
true or else he -does not know the
difference. The Faculty of Arts and
Sciences-Graduate Student Organi-
zation is a body made up of
representatives from each depart-
mental graduate student organiza-
tion in the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences.‘ As an organization’
independent from the Union of
Graduate‘Employes, we do share
with that organization an interest in

the present and future welfare of a

graduate students including those
who are TAs, TFs, GSAs and GSRs. _
As part of this concern for graduate
students, the representatives began
in December, 1976, to plan an
election that would measure the ‘
interest of TAs, TFs, GSAs and
GSRs in having an organization
which would bargain collectively
with the University about their
working conditions. L

From the beginning,__ the FAS-
GSO scrupulously maintained an
impartial stance about the basic’
issue of unionization. This can be
documented by examining the

V minutes of our meetings, the

O

O



articles covering the mock election
ii} the Pitt News, l and. the
announcement we placed in the Pitt
News. Therefore, there existed and
exists no reason why the past
relationship of the computer science
graduate students with the UGE
would affect Mr. Quayle’s eligibility
to vote in the mock election, as he
alleged in his letter.
2) As to Mr. Quayle’s assertion
that he found it “impossible to-
believe” that a list of computer
science TAs and TF5 could not be
found, he hadbetter believe it. The
FAS-GSO desired that the mock
election be as legitimate and
representative of the sentiment of
TAs, TFs, GSAs and GSRs as
possible. In order to accomplish
this, the representatives requested
a copy. of a master list of graduate‘
students in these categories from
the University. Since it is not my
purpose to rehash dead issues, I will
only say that the University
declined to supply the list.
Therefore, as the Graduate Student
Assistant of the FAS-GSO, I sent a
letter to all departmental graduate
student organizations and to all F AS
departmental. chairpersons request-
ing a current list of graduate
students in the above categories
and this can be verified. . Q
In. the case of all FAS
departments except computer
science, either the departmental
GSO or the chairperson or both were
able to send me the lists. I even V
telephoned twice to the computer
science department in the last week

before the mock_ election. and ‘Was
assured that the list would he sent. I

S .

am pleased that Mr. Quayle knows
that “There is a list of all graduate
employes posted in it our (CS)
department,” but it would have
been extremely difficult for me to
visit every department in FAS to
ﬁnd and obtain each list. If a
representative of the Computer

Science GSO regularly participated ‘

in the meetings of the FAS-GSO,

- then they would understand this, as

all other departments in FAS seem
to have.

Hence, it was, as Mr. Quayle
refused to believe, impossible to
obtain a list which would verify that
he was a TF in computer science.
when he attempted to vote in the
mock election. It was impossible
because a of the inability of his
graduate student organization and
his department to supply the proof
in the form of the list mentioned
above.

3) Finally, Mr. Quayle deﬂated
his own argument by admitting in
his letter that, in his case of there
not being a list which could verify
his employment status, “there was
an alternative.” This alternative
was for him to supply proof of his
being a teaching fellow by providing
his letter of appointment, a copy of
this letter, or a letter stating that he
was a TF from his chairperson.

I amafraid I will have to use his
own words in commenting that I
find it impossible to believe that ‘ ‘it
was impossiblefor me to fetch a
copy of it before the polls closed.’ ’ If
his desire to participate was strong
enough, he had the alternative to
provide proof that he was a teaching
fellow. Of course, if his interest in

the issue was intense, it was not of

sufﬁcient intensity to motivate him
to urge his GSO to participate in the
planning of the mock election by the
FAS-GSO, to which they belong, or
even to take the time to xerox a copy
of that list which so obviously was
“posted in our department” and
sent it to the FAS-GSO.

I would like to thank the Pitt News
for allowing me the time to set the
record straight for the Univeristy
community about the procedures
the FAS-GSO followed in assuring
the eligibility of every voter in”,the
mock election. I also appreciate the
opportunity of’ updating Mr.
Quayle’s understanding of why he
couldn't vote. _ ‘

Holiday Is
No Time Off

In reference to the letter to the
editor submitted by Sharon DePue

on March 30, we would like to’
"correct the many fallacies and

misconceptions to which she
referred. , V

First of all, it should be pointed
out i that Jewish students are
excused from. classes on Rosh
Hashanah and Yom Kippur, but
they are notlegal school holidays.

. Classes are still held and Jewish

students are responsible for any
work which they maysmiss. The
concept of ’ a make-up inherently
provides a penalty to those students
who follow their religious commit-
ments in the holiest days of the
year.

If Miss DePue believes that
non-Jewish students are being
discriminated against, she has
totally misconstrued the situation.
While it is true that Good Friday has
not been declared a legal University
holiday, the Jewish equivalent of
,,Easter, Passover, has  not been

fgrantgti holiday. status,” in addition

to many other Jewish holidays
throughout the school year.

Although it is a regrettable
situation, we do not propose that
one religious group be given legal
religious holidays in exclusion to
another group. Rather, in the
future, we would like to see a 6- or
7-man committee, composed of
various religious groups, coordinate
their efforts in finding a solution to
this problem.

Non-Conforrnists
N012 ‘Elitist’

To David Brock: Your compre-Y

hensive theory dealing with the new
elitists was ever so refreshing and
simply a delight to read. Your
attacks on. those dumb ole

‘non-conformists really made my

day. You and I are both smart
enough to realize that there isn't a
single person‘ who listens to WYEP
because they enjoy the music. All of
those radicals really hate jazzy and
folk music and miss all of the
wonderful commercials that one can
hear on the good radio stations that
you mentioned. I’ve been listening
to WYEP for almost nine months
now and I still haven’t won a prize
for answering my phone, “Hello, I
listen to WYEP.” In fact, those
ingrates never even sent me a
bumper sticker for becoming a
subscriber. All that I get is their
monthly pamphlet that describes
thetype of programming to expect
in the coming month. Sometimes
they even ask me for some input on
what type of programming I would
like the radio station to experiment
with. Personally, I _ feel that

important decisions involving pro-

gramming should be left up to
responsible persons such as the
advertising consultants for Leggs
Pantyhose, National Record ‘Mart,
McDonalds and so on.

The portion of your/article dealing
with those foolish Volkswagen
owners was even better. I am a
former VW owner and I had always
liked it because I could have
personal transportation and still
have enough money left to buy a few
luxuries such as food, shelter and
medicine. But now that you’ve
made me aware of the real reason
for my owning a Volkswagen, I’m
really ashamed. For the same price

- Icould have bought a 1968 Pontiac

Bonneville with a fairly new paint

I job and really big ﬁns. I must make

it clear, however, that while I owned
my humble Volkswagen, I never
once sneered at a motorist whose
car was moreelegant than my own. I
just honked and waved. Come to

   §yedn¢saays,iAprn 6, 1 977,-Tin:rITfrflNEws{3Page Q

  I Letters To The Editor  

think of it, I even listened to WPEZ
now and then on my car radio.

Let me make another thing clear.

I did not buy a VW just to rebel
against my father who happens to
drive a Cadillac. In fact he even lets
me drive his Cadillac once in a
while, and I think it’s just a

wonderful automobile—honest.

I certainly would like to agree
with everything you said, but that
just isn't possible. I don’t see any
correlation between “radio station
patronage and intelligence, and I
challenge you to produce any

“eviclence that indicates that WYEP

listeners feel that any such
correlation‘ exists.

As you have suggested, I will not
judge the tastes of people even
though you have done so. I will

embrace human diversity, even

though you have not done so. And I
will try to cultivate an attitude of
love towards everybody, even to
those who I feel were responsible
for my hurt feelings over, the
Vietnam involvement.

As for you... Mr. Brock, I feel that
you havejstepped on the toes of a lot
of Volkswagen owners and a lot of
WYEP-WQED listeners, and to
them you own an apology. Finally, I
doubt very seriously that you speak
accurately for the mainstream of the
American society. It seems to me
that you- are the one who has
allowed society to pass by you, To
put it bluntly, I think you’ve p missed
the boat. V

Rentor Cites Pitt
As Good Landlord

I would like to comment on the
statement made in the March 30,
1977 issue of the Pitt News by
Oakland Directions, Inc. President
James E. Ray; “Pitt has a poor
record of maintaining housing it
currently owns or has owned in

- Oakland. Renovation comes only

after intense pressure by the
community and tenants. ’ ’

As a former resident ‘of an
apartment building owned by Pitt, I

A for more student housing. lThe

  
  
   

ju-

 

. T  5

can only say that Pitt was a very‘  g  Q‘
goodlandlord, probably better than  I ’ ‘
any other landlord in the Oakland 2."  
area. When Ilhad a problem or.
requested something, immediate 
action was taken by the University.t.¢,-‘»,«
Also, the University made every: 
effort to keep the building in good

condition (e.g., ' steam cleaning

outside of building, landscapingVf*-’:;ip
ground around building and putting’ 1 i I
in new concrete walks, painting
apartments when requested, etc.).
They also provided a resident
custodian to maintain cleanliness in”
and around the building.

I feelthe community’s opposition if . p j
to the proposed townhouse project }.il-‘-3.
is unjustified and uncalled for. 
‘currently live next to the parking lot 
where theproposed townhouses are
to be built. In my opinion it should-
be a welcome addition to the
community. The new townhouses
would be like a rose in the middle of
a mud puddle.

As for the parking problem being
left by the loss of this parking lot, I
don’t see one. Sandy Phillips of
People’s Oakland claimed a misrep-
resentation of the facts by Pitt. This
is completely false. _ Even if'the
Forbes Quadrangle lot will be used
by faculty and staff now using the -
Syria Mosque and other lots, that
means that these lots will be empty.
So where is there a problem of the
University causing less parking
spaces? The best solution’ to
Oakland’s parking problem is to 
encourage people‘ to use public 7
transportation. ’. ‘

The University has a

 
 
  
   

   
  
  

great need

townhouses _are an excellent
solution. Not only dothey provide a 
‘ means for curbing the current 
housing crunch, but will always be : 
available for future use. In the ,
event that, some time in the future, A
student enrollment drops and the
townhouses are no longer necessary
for student housing, there is always
a need for housing for faculty
members from foreign countries to
whom these townhouses would be
quite suitable. I think the time has '
come for the people of Oaklandrto
end the conspiracy they have a
against the University and to begin
working with them "to achieve a
4 better environment for all. A

What’s It Worth?

By RICH HARRY

In the midst of rapidly-advanc-
ing finals, students find it
exceedingly self-destructive to put
work off until the last possible
moment. Nevertheless, many fall
victim to this quirk of human
nature——termed “cramming” in
academic circles—and stretch time
like a tense rubber band.

_ For instance, you roll out of bed
at eight in the morning, fully
determined to get down to business_
on that English ‘paper due the same
night. Yoﬁ laugh off the fact you
had an entire week to complete it.

But ﬁrst you shower, shave and
shampoo. You take time out to call
the airport for the weather report.
Ten minutes are then devoted to
choosing color-coordinated dress
suitable for the climate and another
half-hour is consumed by the
morning paper and a cup of coffee.

By the time you approach the
typewriter, three hours have been

clicked off since you got up, but you ‘

are not the least worried. In fact,

you turn on the radio and read a
book you were required to ﬁnish a _
week ago.

12 o’clock and there's no time for

lunch. You go to the library to do I

some inspirational writing and

position yourself at a table in the _

middle of the ﬁrst ﬂoor_so you can
watch for your friends and chew the
fat. K

At length pen meets paper. But
your first sentence invariably
sounds like the ﬁrst sentence of
your last English assignment, so
you crumple the paper and
hook-shot it into a nearby waste-
paper basket. Failure to produce a
satisfying opening paragraph ar-
rives with the next four attempts
and now you start to worry. The
paper's due at 8:00 and you don’t
have the slightest idea about what
to write.

A’couple whispers here and a

blown nose there sends you all the V

way up to some far-off corner on
the third floor where neatly-shelv-
ed back issues of Sports Illustrated
cage your eye. What about the
paper, you ask? After .a quick
evaluation of your priorities, you
spend the next two-and-one-half
hours reading about the ’6O World
Series, the 1975 Super Bowl and
the latest in swimming wear.

>

 

It is now 3:00. A philosophy

class ” (attendance required, of
course) adds to your dilemma and
for the ﬁrst time you admit you’re
in trouble. But you manage to sit
behind some bloated ﬁgure, free
from the prof’s darting glances,

and scratch a couple ideas on the —

back of your notebook. All the
while, of course, you are fully
aware the paper is due in a short,
crisp ﬁve hours.

You accomplish nothing and it’s
now 4330- You walk out of class
wondering where to go next: back

to Hillman? The Cathedral? The
Student Union? The doctor? It
takes you another 20 minutes to
ﬁnally decide to return to your
apartment.

But you miss the bus and get

~ back thirty minutes late, cursing.

It's late. very late. Life has become
as agreeable as an uncontrolled
bowell. You threaten to resort to‘

plagiarism. You trudge up to your \

room where it takes another ﬁfteen
precious minutes to force your
roommate to take his girlfriend
elsewhere for entertainment.

Bu ’s Gu

By DAVE McDONALD

If you’re an exercising nut like
a lot of people, it is time to don
T-shirts, gymshorts, sweat socks
and sneakers, now that spring may
have ﬁnally broken. Since your
athletic shoes provide your only
contact with the road or track it is a

good idea to invest in a good pair

that will suit your needs.

In running, which is the major
form of exercise, shoes are the only
major investment. The money you
will spend on shoes is very small
compared to skiing or bicycling,
where the costs for these sports can
run well over $100. But with a pair
of running ’ shoes costing about
$20-$40, it can become quite
expensive to try every running shoe
that comes down the track.

Since the few inches of rubber
below your feet can make a
difference in your pleasure and
health in running, invest in a good
pair; remember, it is hard to
exercise with sore feet, knees and
hips.

In buying the best shoe that is
right for you, there are three
general steps to follow:

1) Find a shoe that provides good
protection, traction and cushioning
from the ground, or generally a shoe
that will prevent bodily injury. A
proper shoe should provide support
and cupping of the heel, ﬁrm arch
support and protection for the ball
of your foot. The front sole should
be ﬂexible. It is also important you
avoid clodhoppers and ﬁnd a light
weight running shoe.

2) Pick a shoe that ﬁts your needs.
If you weigh 180 pounds or more, a
shoe with more cushioning is
advisable. If you are plagued by
foot trouble, you’ should take this
into account while buying shoes for
jogging. For example, if you get
pains in your achilles tendon, you
should ﬁnd a ﬂexible shoe with
cushioning of the bottom heel in
addition to good elevation. If you
are prone to ankle sprains, find

a shoe with good support and
balance at heel contact. If your
arches tend to bother you at times.
buy a shoe with good arch support
_that.conforms to your foot. Blisters

are hard to avoid. especsialljg in new‘

Terriﬁc. Your roomie hates you
for life, the typewriter is now

staring back at you with its jaws

open and the wall clock hangs
above you like a noose.

Five o’clock. You moisten your
mouth with your tongue, sense the
blood rush to your temples and feel
cold sweat leak from your pores.
You try to resist the urge to relieve
yourself of all the tension; but fail:

You rush down the long carpeted
hallway—propelled. by extreme
urgency—to the room where all
tensions, are inevitably relieved.

But sometimes the greatest
achievements of mankind are
formulated in that very same room.
Maybe it's the solitude. Whatever
it is, you get a brainstorm, an idea
of unprecedented proportions. You
hastily congratulate yourself, flush,
wash and conﬁdently strut back to
your typewriter.

Now the machine does not look

 |an Mi racu|ousOn Stage,

By BETSY NORMAN

After attending her concert
Monday night, it is a little hard to
believo Janis Ian prefers to write
rather than perform.

All four feet and 10 inches put out
100 percent as Ian turned on a near
capacity crowd of 2,200 at Heinz
Hall.

Ian combined a unique blend of
folk, rock and classical in her
two-hour performance.

Opening with “When the Party's
Over,’ ’ a cut from her ‘ ‘Between the
Lines’ ’ album, Ian set the stage for a
talent-packed night. After “From
Me to You, ” she laid out one of the
best songs she's ever done, namely

'“Jesse,” an emotional work in

which Ian longs for the return of a
lost lover. “Jesse, come home/
There's a hole in the bed where we
slept/Now, it’s growing cold...”
"With some great guitar work by
Jeff Layton and herself, Ian

' appealed to the audience in “I Want

to Make You Love Me.”

As Ian says, “That song is a love
song to the audience, who put up
with us when we’re ﬁghting fatigue
and help us take the chances we
must take in order to grow.”

Ian traded her guitar for the piano
and her 11 years of classical training

came through. With her posture ‘

perfect and only her ﬁngers and
voice showing the intense emotion,
Ian broke into another “Between
the Lines” cut, “In the Winter,” in
which she relates a disastrous
chance meeting with an ex-lover (‘ ‘I
met your friend/She’s very nice,
what can I say?”).

Ian, who has a great sense -of
humor, came off with some very
funny one-liners and then broke into
“her New York song,” entitled “I
like New York in the Springtime
When the Pimps Come Out to
Play.” She insists she’ll never
record it, because ‘ ‘It’s too dirty and
it will lose it’s impact.”

“Miracle Row/ Maria” was next,
a two-song grouping from the
album of the‘ same name built
around the life of a hooker. With
back-up vocalist Claire Bay coming
to front, “Miracle Row” has a
bouncy melody and Spanish-
inﬂuenced accompaniment.

Bay and Layton were superb in
this saucy tune and Layton

continued his great guitar work I

throughout the show.

From “Let Me Be Lonely” Ian
led right into a cut from her
“Aftertones” album (“Boyl Really
Tied One On”) and then into more
from her latest album, “Miracle
Row.”

Ian closed the show with her

.    ARTS/    
entertainment J

Grammy-winning “At Seventeen, ’ ’
and was called back "for two
encores.

Layton moved to piano for the
ﬁrst encore, “I Would Like to
Dance,” from Ian’s “Aftertones”
album. Layton proved his
all-around ability and Ian carried
the guitar section like a pro.

, , The second encore, which Ian did‘

alone, was a great one. Amid
shouts of ‘ ‘We want Stars’ ’ from the
audience, she did a social
commentary song and then broke
into another of her best, “Water-
colors’ ’ from ‘ ‘Between the Lines. ”

In an interview after the concert,
Ian explained the new style that
permeates “Miracle Row.”

“Being with the same band for
four years and producing the album
myself has a lot to do with it. The
band does inﬂuence me and this is
what resulted,” Ian said.

“I really do prefer writingsover
performing,” she said. “Iget a

bigger ﬂash from writing but when

I'm on the road, I can’t write and I
go, crazy. ’ ’ V

Ian announced she will start work
on a new album in May and it will be
produced by Joe Wissert, the
producer of Boz Scaggs’ lastest LP,
“Silk Degrees.” She also said a
new single, “I Want to Make You
Love Me,” wasjust released.

characters of Dick and Jane behind
with all your third-grade books, look
again. The whole slew of them has
appeared in sculptural form inithe
unlikely setting of the lobby of
Westinghouse’s downtown busi-
ness building.

In an exhibit of
sculptures by Charles Parks,
sponsored by Equitable - Life
Assurance Co., the familiar char-
acters are back, bringing with them
a neighborhood of friends and
relatives, together with a menager-
ie of lapping, purring and neighing
pets. ._

The description “realistic” is not
my term. True, the 60 pieces, which

“realistic” A

range from ﬁgurine scale to heights
three times my 5-feet-6 and which
have been cast in bronze and steel,
are done in a realist mode. (That
means Parks captures intimate
detail like clothing wrinkles and
ﬁngernails to render his ﬁgures a
highly representational image.)
Iwon’t quarrel with the realism of
his physical portrayal.’ But

regarding the representational-

accuracy of the real world around
us, I would term his works
“saccharinal.”

A little idyllic beauty is pleasing,
up-lifting and therefore necessary
to refresh us from the mundane
conditions of reality. But his
beach-combing bathers communing \
with seagulls, fair-haired maidens
piping a ﬂute while seated on the
golden spread of a sunﬂower stalk
and pig-tailed little girls with Tom
Sawyerish little boys whoopying
joyously on the back of a galloping
stallion, is a little too much for even
one who loves fairy tales.

Viewing bare-footed little girls
fondling tamed squirrels and
rabbits, or his high-forehead
philosopher-looking golden man,
who ponders the marvels of the
universe while idlely stroking the
subdued deer at his side, one has a
tinge of jealousy towards the artists
who evidently lives in such arcadian
surroundings.

' Evidently, because artists create
from their environment, and this
artist, the sculptural Normal
Rockwell, argues the reality of that

environment with syrupy persua-
sion.

But your logical doubts win out.
You’d like to believe in the
existence of Parks’ John-Boy
take-off, portraying a slender-
hipped youth shouldering a terri-

.ﬁed raccoon from the whining jaws
of two hunting dogs.

It must be happening in
Philadelphia, one guesses, on
viewin g the central, climactic ﬁgure
of the exhibition. It is a giant,
fully-uniformed policeman, protec-
tively holding a little girl, with a
stance which in body-language
deﬁes anyone to harm the pigtailed,
barefooted little angel. .

This work was commissioned by
Mayor Frank Rizzo of Philadelphia,
who enthused that the work
captures perfectly the spirit of his
town's force of blue. And me, a
crusted Pittsburgher who barely
survived the recent porno~guarding
incident involving her heroes,

Janis Ian’s performance at Heinz Hall Monday night was outstanding. (L-Fl Jefl
Layton, Claire Bay, Ian, Barry Lazarowitz, and Stu Woods.)

When asked how much of her
material comes from personal
experience, Ian said, “Almost all of
it. ‘Jesse’ is the only one not about a
particular person.”

Ian was questioned about ,the
high and low points of her
“comeback” after . her nervous
breakdown. “That's a difficult
question. Getting a Grammy was

’ pretty cool. Another high point was
when we did a concert in California
before 9,000 and every one of them
got up and danced. The low point
was when I heard the ‘Aftertones’
album. It just wasn’t what I wanted.

Derringer "

 

It didn’t sound anything like the ,
tape. The problem came in the
mixes of the tapes.”

Ian explained her choice of Tom
Chapin as the opener very simply.
“He’s good and he is doing this
whole tour with me.” —

Chapin earned his praise in the
concert. He did a large number of
folk and country tunes and ﬁnished
with the theme from “Make A
Wish,” his children’s show, which
was cancelled this year. Chapin
received a standing ovation and
even did an encore——highly unusual
for an opening act.

‘New Rock’ Hardhitting    

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN

Physically, Rick Derringer is a
small man; but as a rock’n’roll
performer, he is an absolute titanic
ﬁrebrand.

Derringer, and his band of the
same name, were deﬁnitely the
highlight act on ‘a ﬁne three-act bill
brought « into the Syria Mosque
Monday night by Pitt Program-
ming.

The Pousette-Dart Band, the
opening act, and Journey, the
headliner, weren't slouches by any
means, it’s just that Derringer was
the band that turned on the crowd
with its high energy roc ’n'roll
music and dynamic stage ﬂair.

Derringer, a 10-year rock veteran
who ' has" played with both Johnny
and Edgar Winter, let his
enthusiasm for performing rub off
on his fellow band members:
drummer Vinny Appice, guitarist/
vocalist Danny Johnson and bassist
Kenny Aaronson.

Onstage, Derringer bounced
around, glowing with rock’n’roll
exuberance and the band kept up
with him every step of the way.

Their set included songs from the
two most recent studio albums,
“One-Eyed Jack,” “Let Me In,”
“Across the Universe” and “Sittin’
By the Pool,” but was nicely
balanced with two of Derringer's
most famous tunes ‘ ‘ Still Alive and

 

Well” and “Rock’n’Roll I-Ioochie
Koo.” '
After. touring with Aerosmith in
the summer and early fall of 1976,
it’s obvious the inﬂuence of that
superstar band from Boston has had

‘ an effect on Derringer's pop-orient-

‘ed, hard driving rock’n’roll. and
cocky stage act. ‘ , . .
“I respect Aerosmith a great
deal,” Derringer said.
they're one of the few bands that are
saying, ‘hey look. the Stones, the

Yardbirds and Led Zeppelin were it

the innovators of a certain style and
sound of rock music, but now that
sound and style belongs to
everybody.’ What Aerosmith, and
what we’re trying to do, is play now
rock.” »

True, Aerosmith and Derringer
are definitely ‘taking aspects-
‘pioneered by the best of the British
bands. But when it’s delivered with
so much healthy conviction, the
future of rock music is in good shape
with them leading the new breed.

Journey, a four-man San Fran-
cisco based space-rock group, is
also a relatively new band whose
members all have long and lengthy
track records with groups and rock
superstars.

Organist‘ Greg Rolie and guitarist
Neal Schon used to play with
Santana in that group’s early days.
Bassist Ross Valery I worked with
Steve Miller, while drummer

' extraordinaire Aynsley Dunbar

played with the original Jeff Beck
Group, Frank Zappa and the
Mothers of Invention, David Bowie
and Ian Hunter.

Journey’s set was certainly _of
highmusical quality, but it seemed
they occasionally took it to the
audience a little too much in the
form of non-stop, maniacal, power-
house, space-rock jams. Concise-
ness could have helped.

Over a salad and a milkshake
before the show, Dunbar pointed
out how headlining a three-act bill
can be a problem for a band and an
audience that has paid to see them
perform.

A"The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre
performed “Giselle”. this past
weekend at Heinz Hall.
McCarthy, a dancer from Pitts-
burgh, played the leading role of
Giselle, a young peasant girl. The
leading male role, Count Albrecht,
was played by Alain Dubreuil. .

After an idle day last Thursday, \
the‘ Panthers were faced with a‘

second doubleheader in the rugged

tournament card-—this time with

in a complete game, but five errors
by Pitt and a strong mound
performance by BYU’s Tyler

Panthers’ downfall.

~ Panthers certainly opened their

at the Colonial Relays at William

The Panthers didn’t produce any

race in record-breaking fashion.
’Boyd’s time, of 14:13.6 eclipsed

Jerry Richey’s 1968 5,000 record of

the three.-quarter mile in 3:00.0 and
Boyd anchored the mile with a fine

Boyd, in breaking Richey’s
5,000-meter record (one of seven
held by Richey) was very satisﬁed
with his performance. “I felt real

Boyd explained. I “I thought I had a

outkicked by two experienced‘
distance runners.”

Another one of ~ the relays

Grgurich Gets Peavey
  While Chris Dodd-Ies

By CHRISTOPHER C‘. HOEL i

Anyone‘ who thought life was atought for Tim Grgurich during his«6-21
sophomore season as Pitt’s basketball coach ought to see him now, as
the recruiting year crawls and hurtles toward the April 14 binding-letter
deadline. ’ ' ,

For the next eight days, the thoughts of Grgurich and his staff will be
ﬁxed on obtaining non-binding letters of intentfrom prospects they’d
like to see in the Blue and Gold. That is, they’ll be busy worrying about
ﬁnding the next signature when they aren’t busy worrying about losing
the last one. High school seniors’ dream-induced promises are a fragile
thing. _

But Monday was a time for Grgurich to let out at least one sigh of
satisfaction and relief. A 6-4 guard able to handle theiball signed with
Pitt, and it’s unlikely he’ll go back onhis word after_ April 14. Terry
Peavey, a quick lefthander from Allegheny Community College who can
shoot, could be a needed addition to the Panther program,should he pan
out. But, at any rate, he seems a good gamble for any 6-21 team.

So Monday was a happy day for Pitt basketball, but Grgurich was
denied any pleasure he might have derived from even this minor
accomplishment, First, NCAA rules forbade his speaking a word of it;
ACC had to announce Peavey’s signing. Then, and worse yet,
Grgurich’s after-signing celebration consisted of packing up. and
heading out for still more recruits.

Still more recruits would be Chris Dodds and James Smith, in Pitt’s

 

' case. Grgurich is earnestly endeavoring to obtain Dodds’ promise to

shoot and score four years’ worth at Pitt. And Smith, who has signed a
Big 10 letter for Ohio State, was reported to still be considering Pitt over
the weekend. '

3 But Dodds’ ear may not be as rec

 

Roundball. His probable four-year V
stay at Pitt is being preceeded by a 
string of events that brand his case
as unique. A 30-point scorer at I
State College, Dodds expected to be
named a member of the Pennsyl-
vania team for the Dapper" Dan
Roundball Classic. He wasn’t; he
was, however, offered a berth in the
pre\liminary game.

He v refused, but his reason
changes as various parties offer
their version of the tale. The
Roundball folks say he’s a snotty
teenager with more than a little
growing up to do. (He waveréd, they say, -between not playing and
playing so often as to make enemies 125‘miles away, as the Turnpike
lies. ‘

But, counter Dodds’ backers, their kid had plenty of reason for

TIM GRGURICH
no signing celebration

standing up the Dapper Dans. They agree Dodds was upset at being

snubbed for the ﬁrst ‘game, but that he returned his invitation for the
opener because of pr1nciple,not aloofness. He was angered, they say,
by the ‘ ‘political” ‘selection process, and thus passed up a chance to play 7

as a protest.

as a defense that Sonny Vaccaro,
the man who has done an admirable
job of making the Roundball go each
year, ﬁlled one of Pennsylvania’s
. guard spots with 5-11 Tony
DeCello of Mount Lebanon, whose
father is Vaccaro’s lawyer.
Vaccaro’s explanation for De-
Cello’s inclusion is that it came

Macklin, Brashear’s diminutive guard. That really isn’t a good basis for
DeCe1los’s pick, since Macklin didn’t belong in the main event and will

- never play major-college basketball, but it doesn’t work against DeCello,

either. What does work againsthimiis the fact he showed nothing in the
Roundball to justify his inclusion. , 7

None of this, of course, means Dodds should have made the team‘, but
it could mean he may have had reason to pass up a chance for a good time
at the Classic. ,

But that’s not all to the Chris Dodds story. Now, it may be that Dodds
is playing games with Tim Grgurich, and if he is, that may be too much
for Pitt to take if it is wise. I _ A ‘

His pre-arrival character is not enhanced by his delay in signing. For
someone like James Smith, who is deciding between schools, a wait is
understandable, if not good. But for Dodds, who has been linked with no
other school, to prolong his game of visit-and-seek with Grgurich is hard
to understand. \ ,

If Chris Dodds—a good ball-player, though a bit skinny—gives
Grgurich any problems above those that could be expected with a normal
recruit, he could be more trouble than he’s worth, especially for a coach
with Larry Harris, Mike Rice, Sam Clancy and Co. ‘

Lord of the Rings

After much in-program worry and complaint, Cas Myslinski, lord of
the national championship rings, apparently has decided who will get
rings and who will getwbetter views of theirknuckles.

The only players who will not receive rings, which reportedly will cost I

Pitt $240 each, are walk-ons who didn’t play during the year, of whom
there are two or three. ‘Some players, especially réd-shirts‘ and
scholarship players who didn’t see action, were worried they might be
left out, remembering the problems managers and trainers had to go‘
through just" to get watches (or, in some cases, authorization just to
purchase watches for themselves).
It hasn’t been announced how many rings will be ordered (Pitt will pay
for the base rings), but it will be interesting to ﬁnd out who, excepting

The battle lines have been
drawn. The generals have
mobilized their troops. And

Pennsylvania looms as the number-
one battleground as “the fight
begins in less than 24 hours for the
National league’s Eastern Division
championship. '

It'll be the Pittsburgh Pirates
and the Philadelphia Phillies again
clashing for the title in what
promises to be the tightest
divisional race in the game.

The Bucs will unveil a new
offense, one that generates more
dispatch than salvo, while the Phils
‘remain with last season’s incend-
iary attack.

PITTSBURGH PIRATES

Mention the ‘Pittsburgh Pi-A
rates and an image immediately
ﬁlls the mind's eye: hitters of
gargantuan proportions rocketing
baseballs off outﬁeld fences like
hardened peas; those same hitters
transformed into laboring hulks
negotiating the basepaths as if
running through a tar pit; a
pitching staff populated by arms of
questionable talent, and perhaps
even purpose, in light of the
omnipotent attack.

Enter Chuck Tanner. Enter
wide-sweeping changes on the
club’s organizational and player
levels. Enter a winter’s harvest of
off-season transactions and the
above picture becomes accurate
only in retrospect.

For this is a newteam, ‘a team
owing a lot to new manager
Tanner's former employers, the
Oakland Athletics and Chicago
White Sox—two teams that at-
tempted to instill fright in the
opposition through churning legs in
lieu of waving bats.

Not- that the Pirate offense has _

been severely crippled as a result
of the new speed emphasis. Dave
Parker returns as do his 90 RBIs
and'.3l3 batting mark. Al Oliver is
back (albeit in leftﬁeld) along with
his .323 average. And Bill
Robinson (21 HRs) and Willie
Stargell (20 HRs)- can again be
expected to burn the horsehide.
But speed is now the name of the
Pirate game. The Bucs have two
potential 50-stolen-base threats ..in
shortstop Frank Taveras and
center-ﬁelder Omar Moreno. In

 

addition, third baseman Phil
Garner, who played under Tanner
at Oakland last season, swiped
35; he, along with second baseman
Rennie Stennett (18 SBs) ‘and
Parker (19 SBs) can be expected to-

  

increase last year’s totals if Tanner

infected with some new blood, they
just may run their way to a
pennant.

season as he did last year (.323 batting average) if Pittsburgh is to win the

follows past managerial trends. 3
managerial trends.

Only catcher Duffy Dyer cannot
be counted on to provide offense,
but he's better with the mitt than
his predecessor, Manny Sanguil-
lan.

The overall defensive picture
shapes up better than that of a year

ago, with swift Moreno in center-

and Garner replacing Richie
Hebner at third. But Taveras may
be the weakest shortstop in the
league —in the division at least.
Stennett’s ﬁelding average may not
rank among the league’s leaders
but he manages to glove more
grounders than most second
basemen.

At ﬁrst glance, the Pirate
pitching staff’s strength lies in
numbers. But starters John
Candeleria, Jim Rooker, Jerry
Reuss and Bruce Kison accumulat-
ed win totals last‘ season of 16, 15,
14 and 14 respectively. ,Summed
up, that totals quality, too. _

effects of advanced " age last
year—through the trade mart,

Wind, rain and cold weather
spoiled the spring debut of the Pitt
golf team ~Monday at Armco
Country Club in Slippery Rock.

The Panthers finished third in a
quadrangular match behind West
Virginia and Slippery Rock but
ahead of West Liberty. , ‘

Five of the best seven individual
scores for each team were computed
to reach a team total, and Bob
Kurey and freshman Alan English
both shot 76 to tie for the low net
score for the Panthers. Mean-
while, Jim Fitzsimmons shot a 77,
Kevin McCarthy turned in a 79 and
Jim McGrath, also a freshman,
posted an 82 to round out Pitt's top
five.

Pitt captain and last year’s MVP,
Bill Burkardt, who didn’t have one
of his better days, described the
course as short and tight. “It was a
nice but tough little course,” he
said. “And the elements made it
even tougher.”

Burkardt added that many of the
golfers had an especially difficult
time with the last six holes. ‘ ‘There
were quite a few bogies and double
bogies and even a few triple bogies
on those last six holes,” he said.
“On one hole, the wind was so
-strong that my nice straight shot all
of a sudden wasn’t so straight. The
wind had taken the ball at a
90-degree angle straight into the
woods.”

The bad weather didn’t seem to V

bother defending Eastern Regional
Champions, West Virginia Univer-
sity. The Mountaineers glided to an
easy victory and look like a strong
favorite to defend their title again
-this year. v
The Panthers resume their spring
schedule on Thursday in their ﬁrst
home match of the year when they
tee off against local rivals Robert
Morris and Duquesne at 12:30 at
Green “Oaks Country Club.
Burkardt said he is conﬁdent the
Panthers will fair much better in

their next match.

since 1950 the Phils won any type
of championship and one can bet
his bottom dollar they won't have
to wait as long a second time
around to win another title.
However, 1977 will not be the
second time around.

Philadelphia lost its entire right
side of the infield over the winter,
and while manager Danny Ozark
hesitates to bow to admission, the
departure of team leader Dave
Cash (.284) and Dick Allen must
have incurred many a sleepless
evening for the skipper.

Ozark will try to plug the holes
with Ridhie Hebner, who failed to
crack the .250 plateau the past two
years, and Ted Sizemore, a
utilityman coming over from Los
Angeles. This may prove to be the
weakest half-inﬁeld in the NL.

and Larry Bowa. Third baseman
Schmidt‘ has been the circuit’s
principle power source the past
three years, powdering 38 homers
in 1976. Bowa, a spray hitter, has
remarkable range at short.

Bob Boone (.271), an all-star, is
one of the top backstops in

\baseball.

The outﬁeld revolves around the
league’s best all-around center-
ﬁelder, Garry Maddox. He hit .330
a year ago, stole 29 bases and
carries the slickest ﬁelding glove in
the game.

Along with Maddox in the
garden will be Greg “The Bull”
Luzinski, a power-type (21 HRs, 95
RBIs) who hits for average (.304)
and Jay Johnstone, another swing-
ing flychaser (.318) who should
shed his platoon status.

The pitching ranks solid, both
front-line and bullpen, but age is
creeping into the rotation with Jim
Kaat (38) and Jim Lonborg (34).
Southpaw Steve Carlton -can be
relied on, again to threaten the
20-game mark which he achieved a
year ago.

Following these three will be
Tommy Underwood (10-5, -3.52)
and either Larry Christenson (13-8,
3.67) or spring sensation Randy
Lersh.

The bullpen provides Ozark with
some of the best ﬁremen in the
game, including Gene Garber (9-3,
2.81), Ron Reed (8-7, 2.46) and Tug
McGraw. .

The Phillies will be tough, to say
the least.

NEW YORK METS

It’s common knowledge the
Mets have some of the best
pitching talent in the game, but
they simultaneously sport an
offense that can be described only
as a handicap. The result is
numerous low-scoring games, with
New York usually holding the short
end» of the stick.

homerun punch in the Mets’

strikeout ratio at times tend to be a
liability. '

Backing Kingman in the power
department will be leftﬁelder John
Milner, a .271 hitter who added 17

The inﬁeld is the game's oldest.
First baseman Ed Kranepool and

By PATTY TASCARELLA

The lack ofethics in the women's sports program at
Pitt was the major reason for the resignation of head
volleyball coach Mary Kromer Picchi last season.

“The ﬁring of (former basketball coach) Jean
Condo was just the icing on the cake, ’ ’ Picchi said.- ‘ ‘I

that Sandy Bullman (Director of Women’s Athletics)
was very moody, very irrational. I couldn’t tolerate
whatever kindof principles she had. I thought her job
was in administration instead of interference.”

According to Picchi; whose team compiled a 30-5
record in her two years at Pitt including the two
regionals bids, Bullman meddled with the coaching of
the volleyball squad, and displayed favoritism
towards certain players.

“Basically the type of interference that was the

I most harmful was her saying things to the players

during time-outs, like they weren’t playing up to
par,” Picchi explained. “She personally chewed me
out over losing and (during the 1975 season) we only
lost two matches. I ﬁgured if she knew
volleyball—ﬁne. But she wasn’t there at the
practices; she didn’t know.”

In the volleyball team's ﬁrst season (1974), the
Pantherettes were eliminated in the quarterﬁnals of
the eastern play-offs.

“She (Bullman) tore into one of my players and
blamed her,” Picchi claimed. “After that, my kids
avoided her for the most part. When we lost to Ohio
State (one of Pitt’s two losses in 1975) she told me that
one girl was not playing up to her best and told me to
go swear at her.”

“I resented her ignoring nonscholarship players,”
Picchi continued. “She would just ignore them and
the kids themselves resented it.”

Agreeing with former basketball coaches Condo
and Pat Wallace, Picchi said Bullman stressed
winning.

“She told me, ‘I want a national championship-I
:lon't care if it’s in volleyball or tiddlywinks,’ ” Picchi

\

Rightﬁelder Dave Kingman will

couldn’t work for someone who played games. I felt ‘

(Continued on Page 

said. ‘ ‘ She would criticize when we didn’t win by a big
score; In volleyball, closeness doesn’t mean a thing.
It’s all psychological once the skill is there.”
Probably the most notorious of the problems during
Picchi’s ﬁnal season at Pitt was the case of Kathy
Hudgens. One of the co-captains of this season’s 23-3
squad, Hudgens suffered an ankle injury in 1975 and
therefore could not play at her old level. .
According to Hudgens, Bullman called her into her
ofﬁce and threatened to take away her scholarship
since she was not reaching her fullest skill potential.
The jurisdiction to terminate scholarships supposedly
belongs to the coach, but Picchi was not consulted in
the matter and, in fact, knew nothing about the

incident until Hudgens told her following Picchi’s 

resignation as coach.

‘ ‘She (Bullman) said, ‘We’ve given you something.
Now we expect something in return, ’ ’ ’ Hudgens said,
‘ ‘which sounds like an okay statement, but I wasn’t up
to par in terms of the season and thus there was no way
I could perform up to my past potential. And she knew
it.”

Picchi said that after Condo’s ﬁring, “they
(Bullman and Scheduling and Program Coordinator
Carol Sprague) called me. They were pretty panicky
that I might resign or something. They denied what
Jean told me. Iplayed dumb. I had already made up
my mind (about resigning) but I didn’t want the kids to
know about it until after the regionals.”

After her resignation, Picchi requested a meeting
with a member of the Athletic Council.

‘ ‘I told this member every reason why I resigned,”
Picchi explained. “Plus, I have a detailed report of
everything, which wasn’t required.”

Picchi said she decided she wanted to discuss her
experiences when she found out about Wallace’s
contract not being renewed. .

“I decided to talk about my experiences because I
was really upset about the trend athletes were taking.
It was really going down, ’ ’ Picchi admitted. ‘ ‘What do
you do—-ﬁre a coach every year because you don't like

her? -

Cup Tennis Tournament at the '

Alpine Racquet Club, the pressure
didn’t bother her one bit. Neither,

evidently, did. it bother Liebenguth

as he and DeCostro teamedto beat
the mixed doubles pair from OSU to
win the match and clinch the
prestigious Saranac Cup champion-
ship for the Panthers. -
i_“When there’s pressure, I
doubly put out my best effort,”
DeCostro said. ‘ ‘I love the pressure
and the incentive that a challenge
presents. I was really pumped up
for that match against Ohio State. It

I was a situation that I loved, a_

situation where everything’s on the
line. I loved it-—it was great.”

Loving a challenge is one thing,
but meeting it head on as DeCostro
and Liebenguth did against Ohio
State is another. Fortunately for
women's head coach Nancy Gordon
and the rest of the women’s tennis
team, DeCostro, since transferring
from Edinboro last fall, has proven

that meeting challenges isn’t a«

once-upon-a-time thing.
Headingeinto the spring portion of
this year’s schedule, the sophomore
netter from Midland, Pa.,- took a
10-0 record she registered in the fall
into Philadelphia last Monday,
where she and the rest of the
Pantherettes opened their spring

__slate against Penn.

QFNIVERSITY ORATORY  
THE HOLY SPIRIT PARISH

The‘ men’s baseball and tennis
teams will travel to Robert Morris
today for 1 p.m. contests. The
netters are fresh off a victory
against Carnegie-Mellon, while the
batters will open their season after a
visit to the west coach in the
University of California-Riverside
Tournament and follow the game
with a trip to Kent State tomorrow.

“She fulﬁlled the expectations I

tomorrow at Green Oak Country

had of her during the fall,” Gordon

stated. “Hey, a 10-0 record is the
best you can do. I’m hoping that
Janet can give us a similar
performance this spring. Knowing
Janet, I think she can do it.”

Spotless slates like -the one she
recorded last fall are nothing new to
DeCostro. Playing at Edinboro, she
rang up an 11-0 slate last season. Of
course, Edinboro competes on a
small-time scale compared to Pitt, a
fact DeCostro readily concedes.
Nevertheless, a perfect record is a
perfect record, regardless of the
competition.

“Pitt’s tennis program is more
developed that at Edinboro,”

DeCostro noted. “At Edinboro, -we

played more or less _small schools,
local schools. The only real
competition we had was Indiana
State and Slippery Rock—they were
the best competition. Here, we’re
playing teams like Michigan State,
Penn, Maryland, Penn State.
They’re all really strong. It’s more

' of a challenge playing here.”

Ridding herself of the apprehen-

4 sion she felt going into the fall '

schedule, DeCostro is optimistic
about both her and her team’s

“I really didn’t know what to

expect in the fall,” DeCostro
explained. “I didn’t know what the
season would be like. Especially
coming from Edinboro, which is a
small school to begin with. You
don’t have anything like Easterns or
things like that: ‘

“During the fall season, I just
didn’t know what to expect,” she
continued. “Now I know‘ what to
expect. I think the team is
together—all psyched-up for the
season. It’s going to be tough
competition. All the teams we’re
playing have a lot of depth, but
we’re just going to have to hold our
own against them.”

also includes oneehome match at
Trees Courts today, against Robert
Morris and a mid-month trip to the

having been ranked in the Middle
States top 20 ranking for the last six

Meanwhile, new Cards Mike
Caldwell and John D'Acquisto are
long shots to crack manager Vern
Rapp's starting staff of Peter
Falcone (12-16, 3.23), John Denny
(league-leading 2.52 ERA), Larry
Dierker (13-14, 3.69 at Houston),
Bob Forsh (8-10, 3.94) and Eric
Rasmussen (6-12, 3.54).

MONTREAL EXPOS

Montreal won't set the base-
ball world on fire this season and

-can’t be considered a team on the

upswing, but you have to give the
organization an A for effort for
trying to perk itself. up in the
standings.

Newly acquired second baseman
Cash and first baseman Tony Perez
hit .284 and .200 a season ago,
Perez adding 19 homers and 91
RBIs. In addition, they lend
experience and leadership to a club
teaming with youth.

Their infield mates will be Tim
Foli at short and Larry Parrish at
third. Another young Expo starter
is catcher Gary Carter who,
plagued with injuries last season,
hit a lackluster .219.

Ellis Valentine has one garden
position sewn after batting .309 in
the minors, then hitting .279 at the
major league level. Rookie Andre
Dawson, a .357 and .350 hitter, at
two minor league levels, will be

\.

posted at another spot. The third
position will go to either Jerry
White, Mike Jorgenson or Del
Unser.

Manager Dick Williams will
encounter problems with his
pitching, especially since Montreal
sacriﬁced its top pitcher——Woody
Fryman——toget Perez. That leaves
Steve Rogers (9-12, 3.77), Jackie
Brown (9-11, 4.25 at Cleveland)
and Dan Stanhouse (9-12, 3.77) as
the only dependable starters.

CHlCAGO CUBS

To the surprise of most people,
the Cubs ﬁnished a respectable
fourth-place last season, due
largely to the batting exploits of
league batting champ Bill Madlock
and centerﬁelder Rick Monday.

But Madlock (.359) and Monday
(32 homers) have been dispatched
elsewhere, taking with them any
hopes a similar finish in 1977.

This doesn’t mean their replace-
ments are lacking talent. Bill
Buckner, acquired from Los Ange-
les in return for Monday, stroked
the ball at a .301 clip last year and
gives Chicago its finest first—sacker
since Ernie Banks. Taking over
Monday's centerﬁeld roost will be
Bobby Murcer, coming over from
San Francisco, where he hit .259
with 23 HRS and 90 RBIs.

But the Madlock-Murcer trans-
action leaves a large gap at third
base. In addition to propelling the
Cub’s offense, Madlock worked a
fine glove at the hot corner but no
