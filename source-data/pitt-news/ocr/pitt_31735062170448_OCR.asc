PAUL MASONER: Retiring Dean of
the School of Education.

  
   

Convocation Honors Masoner

by DIANE HOLLINGSWORTH

A large and distinguished audi-
ence gathered in David Lawrence
Hall Wednesday for/the first an-
nual Paul H. Masoner Internation-
al Education Convocation. spon-
sored by the University‘s School
of Education in honor of its retir-
ing dean. Paul Masoner.
_ The gold-braided programs and
the ferns on the platform. usually
brought out only for dedication
ceremonies, set the tone of the af-
fair. '

Masoner, who plans to retire

Nixon, McGovern Spokesmen Lock Horns

by MIKE MILLER

The year 1968 marked the end
of an "era of good feeling“ toward
education in the United States. ac-
cording to Roger Campbell. a sur-
rogate spokesman for the Nixon

. administration. Campbell debated

Associate Professor Theodore
Windt. a spokesman for the Mc-
Govern campaign. Wednesday on
the question of federal aid to ed-
ucation.

Campbell said that the Nixon
administration came into office
with "a jaundiced eye- toward ed-
gg:ation." A survey reportedly
showed that educational systems
in this country were far below par
despite the massive federal ap-
propriations.

The administration, he said,
wants to “whittle down structures
and become more efficient” and

place emphasis on vocational ed-
ucation. The administration hopes
to provide every high school grad-
uate with at least one basic skill
by 1980, Campbell said.

He defended Nixon’s bussing
stance by saying that it did not
make a great deal of sense and
that people do not object to hav-
ing children ride buses but rather
"people feel the danger of chaotic
behavior of a lower class of life."

"'Teacher‘s jobs are going to be
more difficult and more challeng-
ing because the administration
didn‘t buy the dogma (that schools
are functioning at optimum capa-

city) that Lyndon Johnson bought."

Campbell said.

He also said that the Republi-
cans’ concerns with business man-
agement and profits made them
better administrators.

Parking atTrees Hall
Considered Dangerous,

by RICK EULER

Individuals who park in the area
of Trees Hall may be taking a
risk, especially if they leave their
car in the area late in- the eve-
ning. '

M-ike Corletti, assistant_ sup-
erintendent of Campus Police.
said that he has received reports
of cars being vandalized and arm-
ed robberies ‘in the vicinity of
Trees Hall.

“I_ would say that about 90 per
cent of-these incidents occur on
the city streets,” he noted, adding
that the area behind the Hall is
particularly troublesome.

The Trees Hall parking lot has
also been the scene of several in-
tgtents. Incidents have also oc-
curred on Saturdays during home
football games.

Corletti said that the area is
somewhat unprotected after 5
p.m. ‘

“It’s a different situation from
last year,” he explained. “Last
year there weren’t many cars
that remained in the lot afteri5
o’clock, but this year it’s not the
same.” i

Corletti added that the situation
is not an unusual one—"there are
always cars being vandalized"-
and that the situation is not so
severe as to require drastic action.

"Of course..one incident is just

,4-  .

  

Definite action has been taken,
according to Corletti, in that pa-
trolling of the area has been step-
ped up. In addition to the usual
spot checks, he explained, the de-
partment has been employing
other types of patrol.

It is hoped that there will, be a
toning down of these incidents as
a result of these measures. Ear-
ly indications are that this is hap-
pening.

Corletti emphasized that the
department would appreciate
more cooperation t'rom.individ-
u_als. however. especially in re-
porting crimes as soon as they
happen.

from the deanship to teach in the
Graduate School of Education,
has served as Dean since 1955. He
is being honored by the establish-
ment of this annual lecture series
and with the Paul H. Masoner

students in the Graduate School of _

Presiding over the ceremonies
was Dr. Theodore T. Polk. direc-
tor of the School of Education‘s

charter of the United Nations Ed-
ucational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO).

Dr. Johnson paid a tribute to
Dr. Masoner. then Masoner paid
tribute to the speaker, the Right
Honorable Frederick Peart. mem-
ber of Parliament and authority
on international education. a
friend of Dr. Masoner.

Peart began his lecture by
praising Dr. Masoner’s efforts in
the field of education, stating that
his work had helped to promote
world peace.

During the address, "Interna-
tional Aspects of Education."
Peart noted that world political
problems directly affect educa-
tion and that "education is condi-
tioned by the context of history."
He mentioned the UN as a posi-
tive force for peace in the world.
and quoted the preamble of the

UNESCO charter;
began‘ in the minds of men. it is in
the minds of men that peace must
be constructed.”

The two greatest evils that op- A

pose peace are illiteracy and

hunger. according to Peart. In or- -

der to combat the first, one must
alleviate the latter, he said. As he

put it. “One cannot teach starv— .

ing children." He again praised
the work of the UN, in particular
the World Health Organization.

In conclusion, Peart said, “The ‘

fundamental aim of education is
to develop to the full the creative
abilities of every child.” He as-
serted that a democracy is neces-
sary for education to flourish, but
that “a democracy is only as good
as its quality of education.”

It will require both vision and‘

purpose to fulfill rising expecta-
tions in this century.

Only Memories Remain

-by KAREN BURGIO

What can you say about a build-
ing that died? That it had to be
torn down to make way for pro-
gress and that fond memories of
rock groups. high school parties.
and conventions went with it.

The Civic Center Motel tso
named because Oakland is the
civic center of Pittsburgh). a gas
station. and a few small buildings
are now in the process of being
demolished to make way for the
Law School. And with it goes one
of Oakland’s' landmarks.

Wrecking crews started work

on the site Monday with ground:
breaking ceremonies for the new

building scheduled for early No-
vember. ~ '

Physical Plant Director Hunt
Martin said that using the motel
for other purposes. such as dorms
or offices was not practical. "The
building was not very well built.
which was obvious if you watched
the men wreck it," he said.

"It could have been used for
other purposes. but it’s a matter
of value. Everything is consider-
ed before knocking a building
down, especially the cost of con-
verting it and the usefulness of
service. An example of this is the
Student Union—the building struc-
ture is in fineshape but the in-
side needs renovation.“

Facility To /vleetiNeeds of Students

Complete

Remodeling

by JOHN CAPITMAN
The Student Union Task Force has decided to make a written pro-
posal to the L'niversity, suggesting either the remodeling of the present
Schenley Hall Student Union. building a new facility on the present loca-
tion. or a new one somewhere else on campus.

Task Force Chairman David Bluey said that "our primary recom-

mendation. however. will be the complete remodeling of the present fa-.

cility so that it more completely_ meets the needs of all Pitt students.
while incurring the smallest cost of the three possibilities.“ '

Bluey explained that this remodeling would entail a better utiliza-
tion 'of the ballroom and lounge areas, remodeling the Schenley Cafe-

teria as avgame room and snack bar, and guttingjhe basement Hunt and

  

Often times, rock groups stay-
ed in the Civic Center Motel when
performing in Oakland, Chicago
among them. Medical and reli-
gious conventions were held there.
High schoolers from the suburbs
spent weekends in Pittsburgh at
the Civic Center. Businessmen
too, frequented the place.

Next to the motel was Scotty's
—an ex-meeting place for night
people. It was here that pushers.
cops and street people met, for-

got their differences and spoke to
one another as friends over a cup

of coffee.

  (Continued from Page I)

I ‘ml-Ie pointed out that Nixon had
 vetoed three education bills be-
” ‘cause they were inflationary.

 ment that Democrats lacked ad-

    
  

to Campbells earlier statement to
-b "the effect that‘the administration
, ' wished to decrease the structures

I S.-Windt said, would make for in-
creased_ inefficiency in adminis-
.'tering’the school system.

this would maintain the present
structure of segregated schools.

On the bussing issue, Windt said.
“I grew up in the South and I've
‘heard the argument for years that
‘you can‘t achieve integration now
because peopleare too prejudiced.
We have to wait for the next gen-
eration] You never hear how in
the South black children were bus-
ed 10 or 15 miles to all black
schools." I

“The federal government is ask-
ing citizens to contribute $400 per
year in taxes for the military and
only $12 for education,” he said.
He also said that the administra-
tion “spends $21,000 to kill a
North Vietnames soldier and only
$12 to educate a child.” p

He stressed the need to reverse
priorities. to pull out of \'ietnam
and spend money on the United
States.

He pointed out that l\/IcGovern‘s
proposed defense cuts would leave
the United States with the capa-
city to destroy the Soviet Union
10 times rather than 20 times as
at present.

He also mentioned that the NEA
and the AFT, two teacher's un-
ions, endorsed a presidential can-
didate for the first time in their
history and that they backed Mc-
Govern. ..

upset.”
However. Masoner explained
that the School had misunderstood

and thought the girl was apply-_

which the deadline is long past.

the beginning of their second term

over previous years.

This decline is not new. having

Voters Face Gov't Study

by JOHN CAPITMAN

Among the many choices that the voters of Allegheny County will
have to make in this year’s election is whether -or not there will be a
county and municipal Government Study Commissions.

.The referenda result from Pennsylvania Act No.0 62 "permits lo-
cal governments to revise their form of government.“ but as Lew
Tronzo in the Office of Governmental Relations explained, "The com-
mission is set up to look at the form of government, not do away with
"it." ' '

Lew Tronzo is running for membership on the County Study Com-

_ mission, but two of his opponents‘ are also Pitt related . . . i.e. Joseph

James, Director of the Institute for Urban Policy and Administration,

V and Agnes Tuden, whose husband, Dr. Arthur Tuden, is a professor of
' _ _ _ ‘, ' _ 
Both Tronzo and James are "pessimistic about the success of the‘

anthropology at Pitt/._

Study Commission question, since as James said there is a "lack of

real feedback from the press and the non—partisan nature of the cam- ,

paign. _

Tuden, who is Chairman of ‘the Allegheny County Council of the
League of Women Voters feels. on the other hand. that the referenda
have "a better than 50, 50 chance of being passed because the people
who would vote yes probably won’t participate, since there has been lit-
tle well organized resistance to it."

This positive attitude is ‘shared by Christine Altenberger of the

Altenberger explained. "In our township there is a good chance for
reaching out to all segments of the community and the environment is
right for change, both of these factors will help."

"The point is not at this timewhether the people of Allegheny Coun-

'-ty want a home rule cha_rter or a new and different form"of govern-

ment." Tuden pointed out.‘ “at this election the only question is should

we study our government."

Jane Thompson in the Citizen Information used the analogy. "Its

like running for the state legislature at the same time as the people are-

deciding whether or not there will be a state legislature. the candidates
are running for an office that might not even exist."
Pitt has some history of interest in the study of local government,

and several local organizations, held a conference on “Local Govern-

ment Change, Do We Need It,” where Joseph James was a panel mem-

FROSTED MUGS

  

by JOHN CAPITMAN

The new Mellon professor went
on to explain that Durer was a
"renaissance man“ who believed
that "without the examination
of the real world there would be
no art."

Yet as Held explained the 16th
century artist believed that the
"function of art is (1) to depict
the passion of Christ, and (2) to
preserve the memory of people
after their deaths."

I

Held, however, showed Durer
as a “man "who surely k‘new fa-
tigue, lassitude, and despair, yet
with a. real sense of humor”
through tracing the development

. of his art from the “timid and
-~ overprecise style of youths to the

 

tt.t.tEx..mt...

free style of a complete dult.”

Dr. Held, editor of Art Bulle-
tin. is in the words of Dr. Don-
ald Gordon. Chairman of the De-
partment of Fine Arts, "a wise

and learned art historian who has -

given us an example of how art
history can be both a scholarly
and very human field.“

solutions to the problems it en-
tailed, "said,Dr. Julius Held,

The Franking Privilege

.. , by JOHN METCALFE
 I just got the word that my Congressman is alive and
 well and franking in Washington. I, along with other resi-
}? “fdents, of the fourteenth congressional district, got a tan ‘en-
 jfvelope in the mail. Inside, instead of the traditiona_l'-rec,1ta-
7-ilt’ tion of those parts of his record most likely to v_in_spire us to
_ ;-f_reelect' him, was a simple message from the congressman. It
‘ ' :'3f:"wa_s non-partisan.
..  It began: “If you or any member of your family is not
‘,{-yet registered to vote. . ‘ and ._went on to‘explain that the
Vdeadline for registration was October the tenth. A list of
..’:,_:e.places to register followed.

 __ Toward the end it said: “Don’t' lose this precious right”
1. “or something to that effect.

A Road By Any Other Name

, by DENNIS PALUMBO

Ah. sweet breath‘ of life, verily dost thy sharp
scent mine eyes smart, mine nostrils irritate. mine
evelashes singe, streaming mist-like upon ebon
wings from the exhaust pipe of yonger '57 Ford
as dost the aroma of newly-baked pies escape t.he
confines of a stout matron‘s glass-enclosed kit-
chen.

And. Lo! upon my very upraised thumb dost
the dark embers of ash settle gently as a drop
of sunlight upon the lily, ‘leaving only a hazy
smudge to adorn the curved, whorling epidermis.
and to attest the passing of said swift chariot.
whose garish vinyl top is even now dipping as
a gull into the foamy spray. dipping under the
pallid horizon line rolling to engage the Squirrel
Hill Tunnel which lay beyond.

And thusly dost the mind of the weary hitch-

' hiker lay open its vault of grave sorrows and bit-

ter ironies.

. . All of which is pretty demanding on a
fellow's sensibilities as he stands at the entrance
to the Parkway at 8:30 in the morning, his left
arm crooked around what seems like a ton of books.
his right arm leaden from the effort of holding
up an admittedly unenthusiastic thumb, his glasses
sliding down his nose. As car after car roars un-
caringly by, the hitchhiker ‘begins to notice a
fine layer of exhaust ash coating his entire body.
Realizing he now looks like a statue, the poor
fellow canonly pray for a cleansing rain. or per-
haps a depraved statue-molester in a '62 Pontiac
heading into Oakland and looking for a good time. . .

* * * * * * *

Being entirely sympathetic to the hitchhikers
plight, I am always on the alert for any new de-
velopments which might make it easier for a trav-
eler on foot to hitch a ride. Just last week. for ex-
ample, I ran across an article describing a system
being tried out in Sweden and Denmark. Accord-
ing to the report, a person intending to hitchhike
on the main roads could sign up at a special
government agency and receive a book of hitch-
hiker’s coupons and an official hitchhiker’s ID
badge. Then, on the road. the hitchhiker need only
wave his ID badge at passing motorists to assure

them of his official status; and. it ne was offered
a ride. he would hand the motorist one coupon

from the book. In turn. the motorist could save’

up the coupons and cash them in for appliances.
furniture, etc.. just like trading stamps-. And every-
body's happy. The drivers get some nice gifts, the

. hitchhikers get where they want to go. and nobody

mugs anybody.

Now this ought to work great in America, and
would surelylincrease the amount of rides given
to kids on the road. God knows, all you‘ve got to
do in this country is introduce the profit-motive
and Bang-O,‘we’ll do it faster and cheaper. Cou-
pons will be mass-produced by government-subsi-
dized industries, gasoline companies will give them
away with a 5—gallon purchase. and any little girl
or boy can own his very own Cap‘n Crunch Hitch-
hiker ID badge by mailing inthree boxtops from
specially-marked boxes of . . .

And of course, the whole affair can be given
that expressly American touch by certain elements
of our society who can always be counted on.

Counterfeit coupons would no doubt abound, stol-‘

en ID badges would whisk convicted mass mur-
derers into sunny Mexico, special hitchhikers‘
hamburger stands and pizzarias would spring up
out of the ground, and—last but not least——Mr. and
Mrs. Average Citizen would go on incredible
pick—up binges, forcible dragging groups of kids
off the road, slamming themiinto the back seat,
and then hurtling down the street in search of more
game, yelling to each other over the startled pro-
tests of their captives and the scream of spinning

, tires: "Hurry upgdammit! Three more coupons

and we can get that chaise lounge!"

"Wouldst that Providence might feign to prof-
fer an alternative to the actions so ingloriously
described,” sighs the One Steeped in Wisdom.

"Though mine wouldst be the first voice raised in
protest should the blessed alternative involveth
the services of the cursed Authority Transit of
His Lordship. Sir Port, well-known to all and, as
such, hath proven the veracity of that quaint no-
tion, namely, that familiarity indeed breedeth con-
tempt."-

Letters to the Editor

Editor:

This letter is addressed to the
people who once supported George
McGovern and have lately with-
drawn their support because he

is not “consistent” or not "radical"

enough.

You want a consistent Presi-
dent? 'You 'got one. Richard
Nixon. It is increasingly obvious
that in spite of all his fancy
election-year liberal footwork. his
heart is consistently with the
fatcats.

The recent series of unsavory
incidents demonstrate that he is
as crooked as he ever was. True.
both sides are apt to call foul in
an election. Unfortunately, Mc-
Govern's charges are pretty well
substantiated. Nixon’s excuses
might be credible if skulduggery
were not so damned consistent
with his record. In a field where
deceit merits no special distinc-
tion, he earned his nickname.
"Tricky Dick."

In case you have forgotten.

Nixon first got his name in the
papers hunting witches in the

McCarthy Era. In Six Crises he_

indicated that for him fighting
and winning wars is part of a

masculinity hang-up. If he wins‘

this election, he will be. in the
words of an aid, “unrestrained

. . . free to follow his natural con- f

victions.".. And you propose to do
nothing about this man because
his opponent has to "soft" a
radical! -

Shirley Chisholm urged us not
to go about
mills". but that is exactly what
you are doing. If you find a can-
didate who is as stubbornly radi-
cal as you want, you can bet you
have found yourself a Don Quixote
who has no chance of appealing
to half the voters. You can fritter
your time and your vote support-
ing some minor left wing candi-
date. or you can spend the next
month knocking "the system."

,Or you can make a serious effort

to throw that sneaky bastard out
of the White House.

Editor: _
George McGovern had pledged
to reduce the power of the Presi-
dency, and his actions back up
that claim. Even in a personal
campaign, he believes in letting
many others make ‘decisions,
and he has enlisted the support
of some pretty strong-willed peo-
ple. These people are more inter- '
ested in radicalizing the country
than in playing yes man in hopes
of receiving some political goodie.
In fact, his problem seems to be
that he delegates too much auth-
ority, resulting in inevitable in-
consistency and confusion. Of
the thousands of statements he
has allowed his underlings to
issue to the press, a few have gone
awry- Considering McGovern's
open style, I don’t think that is
a bad record. The squabbling has
been compared to the‘ way the cam-
paigns of Franklin Roosevelt and
Jack Kennedy were run. These‘
men, whose personalities were
similar to McGovern’s tightened
the reins once in office. Maybe
McGovern will, too. The Demo-
crats have always been famous for
disorderliness. so these problems
do not bother" me too much. At
any rate; we will have to choose
between McGovern's undisciplin-
ed crew and Nixon's slick machine.

Now. McGovern has shifted his
position since his nomination.
Of course! He says he is conduct-
ing a "listening" campaign. If he
never budged from his original
position. it would not appear that
he had done much listening.
wouldit‘?

Then there are the people who
are uptight because of his con-
versations with Humphrey. et. al.
Get serious! If a man can not sit
downand talk with his rivals, in

his own party,
maintain peaceable
with the nation‘s rivals?
This is the first time a major
candidate has been nominated by
a group in which-the powerless
had so large a voice. They nomin-
ated a man who had won the alle-
giance of conservative South
Dakota farmers through honesty.
If you can name one man in
Presidential politics who never
denied the obvious. I’ll be the
first to admit that man is more
trustworthy than McGovern. How-
ever, we do not have that man
opposing George McGovern—we
have Richard Nixon. Are you will-
ing to take a chance on a new
guy, or would you rather stick
with the same old sonofabitch?

Dear Editor,

I would like to clarify someof
the information presented in the
article about the EA-Szabo recy-
cling operation in last Monday's

Pitt News. According to the article,

the services of Vulcan Metal Com-
pany are being used to take the
prepared cans to the recycling
site. Actually. the cans_will be
trucked by drivers hired by Jim
Mook. The Vulcan Metal Com-
pany is recycling the cans. J

The article also included a com-
ment to the effect that members
of EA are displeased with "some
aspects of the food service." The
source of our displeasure.is their
use of plastic cups and paper
plates in place of the porcelain
ware. These plastic items contri-
bute unnecessarily to the county
solid waste problem. I havesince
learned that plastic cups are no
longer being used.

  Assembly of Israelites
Deliver Aurdl Diversify

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

The visit of an internationally acclaimed orchestra is an import-
ant event in the cultural life of any city. the performance of the Israel
Philharmonic at Heinz Hall last week was just such an event..Under
the baton of its young and vivacious music advertiser. Zubin Menta.
the ensemble presented three diverse compositions which reflected
the virtuosity of its musicians as well as that of its conductor.

Opening with the energetic strains of the Mozart Thirty-fourth
Symphony, the group had some. problems in keeping togethe_r.in
tempo at the outset of the initial movement. These irregularities
were luckily eradicated with little difficulty, and the composition
sped onward to a finale of finely proportioned music making.

Bartok’s Miraculous Mandarin Suite filled out the contemporary
portions of the program with a succession of syncopated rh_\'t_hins
that gave some musical headaches in the opening moments of the
work. Once again however, things quickly fell into place and the re-
mainder of the suite was spectacular, especially in its final por-
tion (entitled ‘The Chase‘), where the orchestral texture and tempo
increase to the proportions of a wild frenzy. ‘

Mr. Menta is a conductor who gets his point across without the
gymnastic exhibitions so common these days. His technique was smooth
and relaxed and" he rarely found it necessary to become so impas-
‘sioned as to fall from the podium. Except for the two brief instances
mentioned above, the ensemble was always under control, proving
his competency throughout the concert.’ ‘i A

The triumph of the evening was manifested through the Dvorak
Seventh Symphony. Plenty of “lightning and thunder" here as well
as those Brahmian echoes which please our impassioned Romanticists.
Brass and timpani play a most important role in this mammoth work;

 

/~,.when they don’t quite make it, neither does the remainder of the or-

chestra. Everyone contributed admirably however (the horns deserve
a special round of applause), and the overall product'brought down
the house. ‘

Many in the audience were so impressed that they responded with
a standing ovation. While not a1l'of-us were on our feet at the con-
clusion of the concert, the entire audience was treated to an encore
that displayed the orchestra’s tonalcolors.

In retrospect, the concert showed a welldiscipllned group of
musicians that may someday develop into one of the world's great
orchestras. If they come our way again, we should have little hesi-
tation in deciding to hear them.

_’’All The Conveniences Of Home And Then Some”

Gerdes,

by BILL SMITH
Entertainment Editor

Monday night found Carnegie
Mellon's Skibo Ballroom filled
with students eager -to be enter-.
tained by the University's first
"free.“ concert of the season.

The yellow ticket" said, “Unit-
ed Artist Records in conjunction
with WRCT Radio Present Spen-
cer Davis/George Gerdes. . . Free
in Concert.”

I remember the Spencer Davis"

Group with a fondness. Not for

their Gimme Some Lovin or I’m.

A Man hits out rather an obscure
45 B side titled Can’t Get Enough
of It which contained all the
elements so associated with
their sound.

The lights dimmed and the eve-
ning began with a “campus” group
named Becket. Their vocal har-
monies in the clean Batdorf and
Rodney style, coupled with a lilt-
ing acoustical accompaniment
and backed by a jazz" oriented
piano, solid bass and Latinized
percussion set a relaxed and light
mood for what was to follow.

What was to follow was
George Gerdes, a CMU graduate
(circa 1969) who “in spite of
that, has made it."

Standing» there backed by his
invisible band and smiling ear
to ear he set up a raggy shuffle
tempo that had the audience clap-
ping along from the start. By the
end of his first number I began
to think George Gerdes was some-

He sang of Sweet Janine a San
Francisco chanteuse who “sings
just like Sophie Tucker." He took
us on a Bruno Wolf tour of our
own "steel city," by doing.

. Have You Ever (Been to Pitts-

burgh.” We were then treated
to a sneak preview of the title
song from his second album, Son
of Obituary. Needless to say his
first album is titled, Obituary.

By the time he finished Ballad
of Kneeling Young, a satirical com-
ment on one of our "pop deities."
I knew what it was that made
him stand out and this concert
different from so many others I

had attended. George Gerdes makes

a sophisticated audience of highly
critical, disenchanted young peo
ple laugh. -

He’s not an intense stand up
(or "sit down) comic speeding
through his routines in the way
of a George‘Carlin. His monologues
are not done in the longwinded

.Guthrie sty1e'thougl1 at times his

voc_a_l°qua1ity takes on a Guthrie,
Dylan tinge.

After a surfer spoof and a Jew-
ish American folk song Gerdes
showed another facet of his multi-
talented personality. He imperson-
ated everyone from Walter Bren-
hen‘ to Cagney and including Dylan
in his rendition of You Ain’t Goin’
Nowhere.” ~

A standing ovation brought him
back for The Balad of Ali McGraw

and RyanO’Neal a luekemic love
story.

After securing some wine, Spen-
cer Davis and his "friend" Peter
(Jamison) came out and planted
themselves in a semi-circle of
acoustic guitars.

They shuffled around a bit.
and settled down to a comfortable
woody sound.

Tenement Row a cut from his new

album Mousetrap was first. Then
I Wash My Hands In Muddy
Water a tune done by the old
Spencer Davis Group followed.

After a 12 string version of Easy
Rider an informal version of Big
Bill Broonzy’s Goin Down the Road

was heard then How Long Blues * R 

featuring Peter doing some “nifty
bottle neck guitar.“

Leadbelly was a greatinfluence

on Spencer and inthe Ballad of _ 

Ella Speed he picked the 12 string
in typical leadbelly fashion. ‘

The crowd -wouldn’t let them go
so they came back and did a little
Dust My ‘Blues jam which featur-
ed the CMU All Star Blues Band.-

The concert took on an after- -
hours, feel with everything and
everybody loosening up.

After a distorted version of "I'm
A Man" done in funky half-time.
Spencer pleaded fatigue and sug-
gested that were they to be asked
back perhaps they could do this
sort of thing again.

I agreed with the audience in
their reply to this.

I liked the new Spencer Davis I

do more.

Offensively. Tom Clements. a

the Panthers turn over the ‘ball.-

Despite the Panthers humiliat-

ing grid record.to date and the

grueling task of holding _off the
Irish, Ostrowski. Pitt's junior
halfback is viewing the situation
with confidenceand hope.

"'We're going into Notre Dame
with the idea of winning.“ stated-
Ostrowski. "Realistically I know
that Notre Dame has a good team
but none of us on the'Pitt team
will say they are giving up.

“We’re going into the game with
the desire to play, a good ball game
or even to beat Notre Dame.”

Even after the ND contest to-
morrow, the Panthers’ schedule
does not let up, if anything, it gets
harder. The Cats have yet toplay
such rivals as West Virginia, Syra-
_cuse and Penn State. .

"These eastern teams that we'll
be playing are good but it really
doesn't matter where the teams
are from," said . Ostrowsi.
"They‘re, all quality football

teams and it'll take a good effort .

to beat them. But we plan to be
playing on a par with all the
teams.“ .

Looking at the halfback’s per-‘

sonal performance on the grid-.
iron, Ostrowski is considered to
be “a double threat as a runner
and a receiver.” ' '

' Last season Ostrowski attempt-

ed .42 carries and (picked up 157 ’
yards and one touchdown. On the"

receiving end be flagged down 14
passes for a total of I64 _vards.

So far this year he is 33 for 131
yards rushing and has pulled down
seven passesfor 114 yards.

This season Ostrowski has been
able to see more action due to the
number of injuries to Panther
starters. He feels, (however, that
he has not undergone additional

ed the Pitt gridder. "When you're
in there you always have to do the

Ostrowski is not really satisfied‘
with his showing so far this sea-

“Who can say that he’s pleased-
with his performance,” he said.
“You always have to strive to

  Pm   Harriers

Go After wvu

Out to avenge their last loss the Pitt 'liarr'iers will travel to West
Virginia on Saturday for theirsecond duel meet of the season. Willi a
record-of 0-1 the harriers will attempt a comeback from their 20-35
loss against the Kent State Golden Flashes.

Practicing hard this week the harriers will go into the meet with
five of their seven runners sick with a viru_s or colds. Only sophomore
Bob Steele and freshman Nick Martin remain healthy.

"It‘s a low grade virus." commented Head Coach Jim Banner.

“It’s going to be a rough meet,” he said. “The quality of the team
is very good, if we can just get over this virus.

"You can't fight illness or lack of depth." A

Unfamiliar with the course due to a change made in it from last
year, Coach Banner expects it to be the usual five to six mile course.
fairly hilly.

West Virginia has three outstanding runners, Sauer, Huntington,

’ and Nutter. They were the top three runners when West Virginia beat

Ohio State.

"We have a fine group of boys, dedicated. This is the best quality
team we‘ve had since I’ve been coach.“ commented Banner.

Satisfied with the teams performance. Coach Banner is focusing on
Micky Collins. the sophomore from East,on.‘Pa.. who has done espe-
cially well at practice this week. "

Banner stated, “They are all hard workers.”

When asked about the size of the team. Coach Banner said it is av-
erage in size. He would rather. have a smaller quality team than a

larger, not so quality. team.

Saturday's meet is a big one. The harriers are lookingfor their
first win of the season. Pitt and West Virginia have long been rivals so
both teams willbe up for the meet.

Last. year Pitt won the meet, 25-32, with Dave Szabat, who has
since departed, and Mike Schurko, a sophomore this year, placing first.
They almost set a Pitt cross country record, missing it by three sec-

,

V Coach Banner will be unable to attend the meet due to the fact that
he will have his knee operated on. Coach Brown and Coach Mollen-
hauer will go with the team. ' I

Hopefully this year's meet with the West Virginia Mountaineers
will be as successful as last years.

If the harriers put forth their best effort as they have all along.
despite the "bug" that's going around, they should come out on top.
Coach Banner is confident that effort will be there. I . .

  Akron Bla

FARROKH NOSRATI

(Cont-inued from Page 6)

Pitt battled right back with their
best offensiveeffort of the after-
noon. The booters just’ missed
connecting in a flurry of action in
front of the Zips goal that resulted
from a well placed corner kick.

This time it was Salmons turn
for the heroics. The kick was
headed right on. but Salmon stop-
ped that and the_rebound bounced
back into play. Pitt forward John
Curly took the ball and released a
screaming shot directly through
the crowd in front of the goal
cage. Salmon. however. leaped

ball and head it away from the
nets.

At the end of the first half Ak-
ron had outshot Pitt 11- .4. Those
four shots barely amounted a
threat to Akron and it looked as
if the Zips were intent on having
a field day.

But such was not the case. The
Zips. came out in the second half

expecting Pitt to roll over and
give up. When they found the
Pitt defense tougher than expect-
ed. the Zips seemed content to
just control the ball and work a
slower attack. At one pointthe
Akron coach. Bill.Killen. called
to his players "to attack and not
just keep control‘." V

Pitt managed to scare the__Zips
a few times -with some good
chances but Salmon and his de-
fensive teammates were too much
for‘ the booters offense to crack.

by PAUL DeVITO

Can you recall the fabled tale of
?_ David and Goliath‘? Or how about
Joe .Namath‘s leadership of the
New York Jets over the monolith-
ic. unbeatable. superior. almighty
_ -.\'F‘L Baltimore Colts in the Super
Bowl‘?
Can you even imagine the Pan-
_ thers defeating Notre Dame this
_v 'Satui‘day‘? Sound like miracles‘?
..Well a feat almost as miraculous
«as the ones above just happened
_ , this past weekend to one of Pitt's
,~"own teams.

That's right. miraculous.

. The team is the University’s
- road race team.

._, Wh_v and what is so miraculous
 about them? Well. first of all they
— won a championship. That in it-
». self is a miraculous achievement
 for a team at dear old Pittsburgh.
_a Along with that, they did it among
 giants.

_  The championship title is the
[3ﬂ.\.'ortheastei‘.ii United States
 Sportscar Championshp and Pitt
1;" is the first collegerace team to

A‘ The actual crowning of the
.. champions was anti-climatic since
 they weren’t even present at the
ceremony. But, there was a good
cause for that. . — A
.»‘}_This past weekend a race was
.held at the Indianapolis Speedway
Park, the last in the championship
: series. A strong finish at this race
,would -sew up the title for Pitt
since’ the team had a three point
lead of first place.

 f- _- _But. on Friday afternoon before
_tlie_Sunday race. driver Bob I-‘ry-
_';ei‘ was informed that the second
and third place cars. driven by
;.Ted Sullivan of. Massachussetts
