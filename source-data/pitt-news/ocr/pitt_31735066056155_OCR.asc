JFK assassination
theories discussed

By Cameron Harvey
staff Writer

The Warren Commission’s findings in the
Kennedy assassination were completely inaccurate,
according to forensicsspecialist Dr. Cyril Wecht.

“Just begin to read and study. Your mind will not
let you believe the Warren Commission if you have
a drop of intelligence,” Wechttold the standing
roomonly audience last night.

Sponsored by the University Democrats, Wecht
vacillated between a whisper and a roar describing

‘his theories to debunk not only the Warren

Commission"s report, but Gerald Posner’s new
book, Case Closed., which deals with JFK’s assassi-
nation.

According to Wecht, 75 to 80 percent of the
American public rejects the Warren Commission's
findings with this number steadily rising.

Posner’s credibility is questionable, according to
Wecht.

“Posner comes across as a radiologist,_a comput-
er specialist, a ballistics expert and a forensics spe-
cialist .. all this from a Wall Street lawyer with no
medical lawsuit experience of any kind,” Wecht
said.

Of the actual examination by 32 medical special-
ists at the time of Kennedy’s assassination, the
Warren Commission says that, “all 32 erred that
night [in the location of the would upon Kennedy’s
head]. What is the probability of that,” Wecht said.

Wecht questioned the audience.

Why would Lee Harvey Ozwald try to assassinate '

Kennedy from the vantage point at which
he allegedly did when trees were blocking the
shot? _

Wecht said that if Ozwald had attempted the shot
minutes before it would have been “Duck Soup,” as
there were no trees in his line of fire.

As to why the government would cover-up the

‘fact that more than one assassin might have acted,

Wecht mentioned that by definition Judicial Codes

define an illegal action by more than one person as‘

a conspiracy. By naming Lee Harvey O/zwald the
lone assassin, the government was saved the extra
task of trying to track down another assassin after
Ozwald’s assassination, Wecht said.

“lTl1e Warren Commission] cannot move from the
single—bullet theory because then it is finished,”
Wecht said.

Casey receives good report at check-up

By Brian Lehew
For The Pitt News

Doctors at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center reported
Gov. Robert P. Casey's condition
as “very good” following a rou-

tine checkup Tuesday — three
months after his double heart—liver
transplant.

The governor’s test results showed
his new heart had normal blood flow

and neither organ showed any signs
of rejection.

According to UPMC spokesperson.

Jane Duffield, doctors report-
ed Casey’s test results as encourag-
ing.

Doctors lowered Casey’s dosage
of the experimental drug FKSO6, used
to prevent rejection of the new
organs. Casey was placed on the
drug following his dual transplant in
June to enhance his chances of sur-

vival.

Since a previous heart biopsy
showed no signs of rejection, the
governor was able‘ to skip the biopsy
scheduled for this visit.

. The governor left Presbyterian
University Hospital at 12:50 pm. yes-
terday. He will return to UPMC in
two weeks for another checkup and
will receive another biopsy at that
time.

Committee narrows field of candidatesfor safety director

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

The field of candidates for
the Pitt’s director of Public
Safety position will “most likely”
be narrowed to 10 finalists
today as the director of Public
Safety search committee works
to fill one of several important
positions left vacant due to res-
ignation and retirement.

“We had hoped the process
would be further at this point,”
John C. DeVitto, assistant chan-
cellor for Business, said. “But
I would rather [the process]
be slow and methodical than
make any mistakes. The com-
mittee is doing a thorough job
of finding the most qualified

\An.—-)9\A)sA¢l¢QAQ

person.”

The director of Public Safety
position, which is in charge of
campus safety at Pitt, has been
without a permanent "replace-
ment since the resignation of
William Brennan in March. Walt

H. Waters is currently serving as

interim director.

According to Student
Government Board President
Jacob Brody, the search nearest
completion is for the public
safety director.

‘.‘We could possibly name a
new director by Jan. 1,” said
Brody, who serves on the direc-
tor of Public Safety search com-
mittee.

Director of Public Safety
search committee. Chairperson

.--.n.«...........-..

and assistant vice chancellor of
Real Estate Acquisition and
Finance James Watters, said the
committee reviewed 91 applica-
tions and resumes for the posi-
tion. He said it planned to agree
on ' 10 to 12 finalists at
Wednesday’s meeting.
Replacement searches for the
offices of provost and director
of the University Library System

are also currently being carried

out at Pitt.

The provost search committee
is still in the process of accept-
inglapplications, according to
Chairperson Mary Lou Soffa,
dean of graduate studies in the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
She said the public is invited to
open hearings on provost

replacement scheduled for Oct.
8 and Oct. 12.

“Students will have the
opportunity to express their
views concerning the type of
person they want as provost,”
Soffa said.

Soffa said she hoped to pre-
sent a short list of three to five
finalists to Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor by April 1.

Between now and when the
new provost is. hired, Interim
Provost Mark Nordenberg said
his work will not be hindered
due to the temporary status of
his title.

“Chancellor O’Connor made it
clear to me that the qualifying
adjective ‘interim’ applies only
to the time I will beserving as

provost,” Nordenberg said. “I
expect to shoulder the full
responsibilities of this position
while I’m in office.”

He said one drawback may
be the fact that he will not be
able to supervise the implemen-
tation of the initiatives he has
planned, depending on the
length of the search.

The search for a permanent
director of the University
Library System has been a very
lengthy one, spanning three
years since William Roselle
resigned in 1990.

The closest the position has
come to permanently being
filled was August, 1992, when a
search committee trimmed :1 list

SW/orldiof ma/ee-believe alive omdwell on the Fit Campus

By Courtney Chisholm
For The Pitt News

For everyone who misses the
good old days when they were
young and carefree and were
allowed childhood indulgences
such as new big wheels, Barbie
dolls and endless hours of
“Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,”
there is help. Pitt students have
the opportunity to once again
visit the land of make-believe
right here on campus. -

The official archives of the
“Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood”
television series, located in the
Elizabeth Nesbitt Room in the
Library , and Information
Sciences Building (SLIS) contain
scripts, document files, pub-
lished books, recordings,
résumés, videotapes and pup-
pets from the famous children’s
show.

“There aren’t too many collec-
tions of television programs at a
university library  none of a
children’s educational program,
and certainly none as presti-
gious as ‘Mister Rogers’
Neighborhood,” Perry Reeker,
special collection assistant and

director of the Elizabeth Nesbitt

Room, said. .

t The puppets that are a part of
the collection are on loan to
The Children’s Museum. They
include: Ana Platypus, King
Friday XIII, Lady Elaine
Fairchild and X The Owl.

The archives weregdonated in
1976 by Fred Rogers himself.

. Over the years the university

has collected more and more

Theft still

prevalent
on campus

By Christine Hanna
News Editor

Bikes, bookbags and wallets
were popular targets for thieves
this week. ,

A student’s bike, left unat-
tended for approximately 10
minutes in front of his residence
on McKee Place, was stolen.
A wallet was taken from an
unattended bookbag in the
Towers lobby. A student left her
wallet unattended on a William
Pitt Union table. When she
returned it was gone. These are
just a few of the» items stolen
this week. Assistant Public
Safety Director Gary Moses said
theft is a serious problem on
campus. .—

“Theft is the major crime com-
mitted on the campus area,
since items are left unattended
and rooms are left unlocked,”
Moses said.

Moses said that students
should never leave their back-
packs or other items unattended
anywhere on campus. Also, stu-
dents should always lock their
doors, even if they are just
going next door, he said.

According to Moses, students
with bikes should register with
the Department of Parking and
Transportation so the serial
number is on file. Also, he

See Tbeﬁ, page 6

#’n¥o%‘hb1:s5n§dt4‘£xI&¥.i3-:Id.*£SLIn:it3£u¥4u*s2‘.-nu‘-Jun

items.

“The objects were donated
primarily because the people on
the faculty of the university
befriended Rogers, and also
because we’re in his neighbor-
hood,” Reeker said. “[Rogersl is
also an adjunct faculty member
of the school of library and
information sciences.”

The university library system
is very proud of this collection,
Reeker said, andit has a com-
mitment to keep the archives.
“These unique artifacts make
Pitt interesting,” he said.

The show is produced by
Family Communications, Inc.,
who work out of \X7QED—TV,
which is a local television sta-
tion.

“One of the retired faculty
members of SLIS, Margaret
Hodges, used to do storytelling
on WQED and became associat-
ed with Rogers,” Reeker said.

“She also is the one who

came up with the idea of nam-

ing this room after Elizabeth
Nesbitt.”

Reeker said Pitt obtained a
grant from the Department of

-Education in 1983 that allowed

the cataloging of about 600 pro-

grams.

The programs listed can be

’ searched on PittCat. Students

can look up any episode that
they desire to see by simply
typing the episode, title or a
related subject into the comput-
er. _

If people know what was on
a specific episode, they ‘could
also search for an episode using

that person’s name. Episodes
can also be found by searching
for songs that were sung on a
particular show.

Since the show is directed to
the three- to five-year-old age
group, the episodes reflect
Rogers’ understanding of chil-
dren in that age group and the
cognitive process of a child’s
development, according to
Reeker. '

“Even some faculty members
have brought in their children
to see the episode where M ister
Rogers’ fish dies,” Reeker said.
“It shows them about death and
dying, so they can dealwith it.”

Everyone is welcome to use
the ‘archives for research or for
their own personal enjoyment,
Reeker said. I

The tapes can be watched in
the library or students can bring
in a blank: VHS tape and the
episode can be copied for edu-
cational purposes. Reeker said
they usually require a note from
the professor to copy a tape.

The episodes are mainly
resource materials in the fields
of education, communications,
art, music, political science and
literature, but no one is exclud-
ed from the use of them, Reeker
said.

Students often find that when
researching other topics, they
run across an episode of “Mister
Rogers’ Neighborhood” that
coincides with what they are
researching.

All materials in the library are
under the jurisdiction of the
University Library System.

Hands-on experience beneficial in job search

There’s an old saying that tells us “experi—
ence is the best teacher.” In today’s compet-
itive job market, it can also be said that
experience is the best employment refer-
ence. Increasingly, recruiters are selecting
graduating students who have combined
academics with practical, hands-on experi-
ence.

- Graduates with a work history have sev-
eral key advantages. Past or current

employment demonstrates a willingness to

put in the time and energy needed to be a
successful employee and provides a source
of references from former supervisors who
can attest to the candidate’s skills and abili-

_ ties. And if summer or part-time work

helped to pay the bills through college, it
gives potential employers an insight to your
character. C

Probably the best type of work experi-

ence is an internship or co-op assignment,
where you can work in a field or industry
that interests you. These types of jobs may
lead‘ to offers of permanent employment
after graduation. At the very least, they
allow you to develop skills that are valued
by many companies — writing, project
team experience or programming skills, just

to name a few. In many cases, you can even '

earn academic credits for successful corn-
pletion of the job. The School of

~ Engineering has its own co-op program —

information about opportunities and eligi-

bility can be obtained in room 749
Benedum Hall. Other students should stop
by the Internship Office in room 1-40
Thackeray Hall.

Some of the most valuable work experi-
ences can be found through volunteering. If
you can afford the time and don't need the
cash, you can often find an unpaid position
that gives you a lot of management respon-
sibility and administrative discretion. The
fact that it’s a volunteer experience won’t

The
Placement
Center

matter to recruiters — they’ll focus on what
you did, not how much you made. Best of
all, you’ll have a chance to perform some
worthwhile community service while you’re
building your resume. Contact some local

nonprofit organizations and find out what S

opportunities are available. An excellent
source for accessing these organizations is a
publication called Where To Turn, pub-
lished by the United Way. It’s available at
the reference desk in Hillman Library. And
don’t overlook the Pitt campus —— leader-
ship positions in activities are prime exam-
ples of unpaid experiences that can pay off

handsomely at graduation.

If your work experiences through college
will probably be limited to fast-food restau-
rants and landscaping crews, take heart.
Many of the corporate recruiters that you’ll
interview with probably did similar work
while they were in school. And you can still
get a lot of mileage out of “nonrelevant”
types of jobs. The trick is in how you pre-
sent your experiences to potential employ-
ers. _

For example, waitressing at a restaurant

can either be described to an interviewer as

“waiting on tables,” or as a position requir-
ing strong customer service, versatility, an
ability to work under pressure and the skills
to resolve problems quickly and profession-
ally. For an extensive listing of part-tiine
employment opportunities, visit the Student
Employment Office at room 200 in the
William Pitt Union.

One last tip. While you’re working a suin-
mer or part-time job, always keep your eyes
open for opportunities to expand your
knowledge. Take the time to find out what
other people in the organization do and
learn all that you can. 0

Discovering the basics of writing grant
proposals or using a computer software
package may .not increase your hourly
wage, but it can help turn that mundane job
into something special when you’re inter-
viewing during your senior year.

question
reality

By Rachel Barrett
and Monika Colbert
The Pitt News

Death, love, religion
and trauma are some of
the avenues through
which we are able to
reassess our values,
according to last night’s
Self—Knowledge
Symposium orientation

. meeting.

Encouraging introspec-
tion to oneself, guest
speaker Al Fitzpatrick
challenged students to
question personal truth,
reality and their own life’s
direction.

“SKS is for seekers,”
Fitzpatrick said.

“SKS is for people who
are beyond asking why
[and are now] asking
how.”

By throwing out every-
day topics such as being
in love, religious faith,
death and divorce,
Fitzpatrick aroused
intense discussion.

“By using others as a

-mirror to bounce ideas off

of  a group can take you
farther than what you can
do on your own,” mem-
ber Mike Donison said.

The goal of the SKS is
self_-examination through
exploration of individual
belief systems and values;
determining what is real,
important and true.

“The answers you get

out of it comes through »

questioning what
makes this different [from
church, for example] is
that you can’t go into
churches and raise your
hand to ask questions,”
Fitzpatrick said.

Students responded to
the ideas of SKS and
many expressed desires
to discuss practical means
related to values, accord-
ing to a survey taken by
the SKS.

SKS will meet on
Tuesdays in the Cathedral
of Learning.

One attendant, Steven
Werber, said, “I enjoyed
this and I think I’ll enjoy
the lectures. I’m always
seeking something and
hoping to learn some-
thing.”

Recruitment
looks good
for student
government

By Sam Gresock
For The Pitt News

Each September on Pitt’s cam-
pus, clubs, Greek organizations
and other student groups spend
time and energy seeking out
new members. The Student

.Govemment Board is no excep-

tion.
Approximately 45 first-year

‘ students have expressed an

interest in taking part in SGB’s
Freshmen Council, according to
SGB board member Tom
Grassia.

Grassia said he believes the
SGB could have a solid year of
recruitment.

“We’ve had a very, very posi-
tive response so far,” he said.
“We got allarge number of peo-
ple interested at the Activities
Fair, and seven people have
already made an effort to
give us their schedules so we
can set up times to meet with
them.”

Board member Brian Bolton
expressed a need for more stu-
dent involvement.

“Several students have asked
us about the SGB,” Bolton said.
“We could always use more
people.”

Bolton said SGB-sponsored
events such as open forums can
increase student interest in
becoming involved with the
SGB. Unlike some other stu-
dent organizations who adver-
tise recruitment events, the SGB
relies primarily on word of
mouth to get its name out to
prospective members.

“The time frame is too quick
[to advertise scheduled eventsl,”
said Grassia, who is the SGB
liaison to the Freshmen Council.
“By the time we get ads mm in
The Pitt News or things like
that, we have something else
going on.”

Grassia said current Freshmen
Council Chair Todd Neufeld is
in charge of publicizing SGB
recruitment and is “doing a real
good job.” —

According to Bolton, becom-

, ing involved in the SGB can be

an excellent learning experi-
ence for its members. I

“You can gain great knowl-
edge of what goes on at the uni-
versity and what you can do to
effect changes,” he said.

Grassia said students
who “want to help the campus
community, ' get involved
and get active” will find involve-
ment with the SGB to be invalu-
able. ‘

“We can’t bring people in and
tell them, ‘the SGB offers you
this particular thing,”’ Grassia
said. “But when people get
involved in the SGB, they get
organizational and leadership
skills. They get to see things go
from the idea to the end prod-
uct.”

Grassia added, “You get a lot
of hands-on experience. That’s
what college is allabout.” I

Counseling Center offers Variety of services

By Edward Cabana
For The Pitt News

‘Making an appointment at
Pitt’s Counseling Center
“doesn’t mean you’re crazy or
disturbed. We view itras very
healthy,” according to Dr.
Robert Gallagher, director of
the center.

Gallagher acknowledged
that some students might be
apprehensive about seeking
psychological counseling.
“There’s always some stigma,”
he said, “but many more peo-
ple admit openly now that
they’re in therapy or counsel-
ing and in some places it’s the
thing to do.”

The center is located in
room 334 of the William Pitt
Union and also offers career
and leaming-skills counseling.

Most of the psychological
counseling done at the center
is short—tenn (three to five ses-
sions), although more help
will be provided if a student

has a problem which
will require it and can’t get
help otherwise. All of the
counseling is confidential and
free.

“Students should keep this
in mind as a place to come if
conversations with friends and
other trusted people aren’t
adequate to help them with
crisis they’re experiencing," he
said.

The center offers both per-
sonal and group counseling
about personal problems
such as coping with university
life.

Also offered in career coun-
seling are classes like
“Explore,” which is a three-
session course where stu-
dents explore what their indi-
vidual tastes are in the career
world.

A career test is available for
a small fee for students who
want to see what careers they
are best suited for.

A learning skills center is

also located in the Counseling
Center.

It contains tutoring and help
with problems such as bad
study habits.

There is a computer lab
where students work directly
with a computer to help
them work on the problem
they are encountering in
school.

Gallagher said about
“25 percent of students will at
one time or another feel very
depressed  We suggest
that [students come to the cen-
terl whenever they get to a
point in their lives when their
problems are such that they
don’t feel they can handle
it on their own, and they want
a confidential setting to

talk openly about the con—'

cerns.”

The Counselling Center has
six psychologists, four student
intern counselors, two career
counselors and six additional
assistants for the learning skills

lab. Gallagher said they are
also planning to hire a sexual
assault coordinator.

Gallagher’s background
includes a bachelor in science
and education degree from
Fitchburg State University in
Mass. A

He then entered a competi-
tion at Harvard in the field of
counseling, won, and received
a grant which he used to
receive his doctorate at
Rutgers.

When asked why he chose
university counseling he
responded, “I thought this
would be the most interesting
population to work with.“

. Already with :1 Waiting list

for counseling, Gallagher said

the Counseling Center is busy
these days and appointments
are required.

There are, however, many
pamphlets available if stu-
dents want to stop by and
get some idea of what is
offered.

H isiory repeated

Although our generation stresses “education, it seems
we don’t want to learn from our mistakes. History is the
best teacher around, and it seems we’ve been sleeping
through class. 

Not even 50 years ago, atrocities like the ones now
happening in the former Yugoslavia were being com-
mitted in the same part of the world. And once again,
by and large, the international community is doing the
same thing. Nothing. 1

The U.S. Holocaust Museum opened this year in
Washington, D.C., to eternalize the memory of the mil-
lions of Jews, Poles, homosexuals, Gypsies and others
who were slaughtered during the wake of the Nazi
machine. ;

Yet, we want to turn the other cheek on the Bosnian-

Muslims who are meeting the same fate today.

We have a stake in the fate of these people. They are
a part of the human family. And if we don’t do some-
thing, who knows when it will end?

By this time, one would think that the human race
would be mature enough to realize this behavior cannot
go on. According to relief experts, there will be tens of
thousands of additional deaths on top of the tens of
thousands who are already dead.’

If there is no action taken, our generation will be full

of nothing but cowards with no sense of morality and .

compassion. -

Hopes were rekindled a few weeks ago with the for-
mulation of a partition plan in Geneva, Switzerland to
end the fighting between the Serbs, Croats and Muslims.
But recent developments show the Bosnian govern-
ment forces battling on.

According to the Sept. 13 issue of the US. News and
World Report, support is growing in Washington to lift
the arms embargo and formulate international policy to
defend the victims. _

No one wants to see any deployment of American
troops to the region for fear that American. lives might
be lost. But at certain times in history the moment will
arise when sacriﬁces must be made in order to have a
brighter future.

By no means should America carry the load itself.

However, the international community looks to the
United States for leadership. President Clinton, whether
he likes it or not,‘ has to be the man to provide the
impetus for an international effort to help bring about a
solution. , ’

We have many things on our minds today, and the
tendency to forget what is going on around us is
extremely common. I
‘ But the human race is in jeopardy.

Stand up for what is right and just. Let your voice be
heard by the decision makers in this country. Let’s make
it so colleges and universities set the tone for social con-
sciousness in America once again.

Crime rate taints U.S. credibility

Within the past several weeks, there appears to
have been a growing amount of media coverage
about the savageness of urban life in America.
Most of this coverage isn’t coming from the
American media, which seems much more inter-
ested in making excuses for criminals instead of
punishing them as the predators they are. Instead,
the extensive reporting of such crimes is being
done by news media overseas.

After yet another German tourist was merciless-
ly slain in Miami, the German govemment repeat-
ed its earlier warnings for German citizens to stay
away from Miami and to take caution when trav-
eling anywhere in the US. After this last act of
barbarianism, who can blame

administration, this policy is contradictory
because these are the very same values that help
to perpetuate violent crime in our society. The
statistics prove my point. In 1960, there were
“only” 666 victims of violent crime per day in the
U.S. In 1991, the number of victims per day had
risen to 5,213, an increase of 563 percent.
Between 1988-91 more people in the U.S. were
killed by guns than during the entire Vietnam War
(“CBS Morning News” 5-2-93). If these statistics
don’t make you stop and think what has gone
wrong with our society, you’re sick. Everyday in
this country 13 children are killed by handguns.
Do some quick multiplying and it becomes clear
that many parts of America are

them?

all over Germany. This murder comes right after
the murder of another German tourist in April and
the murder of a Japanese exchange student in San
Francisco. Clearly the U.S. “justice” system is on
trial throughout the world as it begins to look
more and more as if the only thing governing
American society is the law of the jungle.

This is a particularly cruel paradox considering
that it is the U.S. that is always advocating human
rights in other nations, while forgetting that in
many places in America it is not even safe to walk
the streets after dark. Drug dealers are every-
where, children are routinely kidnapped, carjack-
ings are on the rise, gang members rule many
parts of our cities, rape and murder are part of
daily life and many of ourjchildren can’t even
attend school without the fear of being shot in the
classroom. The American government and

American people had better wake up and fix the V

ed from society because they cannot be rehabili-
tated. If we don’t believe the consequences of a
decadent and immoral society, we need only look
at one of history’s greatest civilizations, the
Roman Empire, to see the inevitable results.

This country must have leaders and citizens
who have the courage and common sense to
make criminals pay for their crimes. In the case of
murderers, that can only mean ‘the death penalty.
Our “justice” system must start trying those juve-
nile thugs and hooligans as adults, because chil-
dren don’t go around blowing people away with
AK-47 assault rifles. People with no conscience
do. , .

It seems to be time that we as a nation question
just how civilized we are. Our society no longer
values life as the precious gift that it is when we
don’t make criminals pay.

When a predator serves “only an average of
seven years in jail for committing a murder, our
society has said that it values a human life to be
worth only seven years. If our society truly
believes that, then we are indeed in sad shape
and have no hope for the future. Think about it
and act on your conscience. . .

however, most of the hand

the Panthers’ number-one tail-

Upset win over
Bowling Green fires
up '93 team; season
openerSauuday

By Brett Fondrk.
For The Pitt News

The Pitt Rugby Club ended the season
last year by defeating national power-
house Bowling Green. That was the
highlight of a spring season that ended
with three wins and one loss. The team
hopes to continue its winning ways
when the fall season opens Saturday at
Shippensburg. G

The Bowling Green win is still fresh
in the minds of the 21 players returning.
from last season.

“Bowling Green is a national power,”
senior Ed Davis said. “It was a big win
for us. It gave us the recognition we
deserved.” .

Although expectations for the season
are high, the veterans have tried not to
put too much pressure on the 19 new
players.

“The new guys have a lot of talent,”
captain Dave Campion said. “This is the
first time I’ve seen this many. Hopefully
they can step up and help the team.
T hey’ve picked the game upiquickly.”

“The older guys have been very
patient,” rookie Rob Lewis said.

Senior John Lewis, who will be looked
upon to lead the team.

The team plays four regular season
games with the season ending Oct. 16
at the Allegheny Rugby Union
Championship. The team said it feels
that it has a good shot of advancing
past this to the Midwest Rugby Union
Championships. R

“The team is confident. We feel we
can beat anybody,” Davis said.

The confidence that Davis spoke of
can be seen throughout the team.
Enthusiastic practices and players help-
ing each other have been two character-
istics of the team. The emotional high
from the Bowling Green victory has car-
ried over to this season, and the veter-
ans have spread that emotion on into
the ranks of the younger players.

“The rookies are confident because of
the veterans,” senior Adam Brennan
said. 2 2
The outlook for the season is good
and the players are positive. What else
could a team ask for? .

“We are still looking for players,”
Campion said, noting that anyone inter-
ested in competing should call him at‘
621-6365. “Come out_and make an effort

prospective players should be prepared
to “work hard” and “run.”

Talented veterans, promising rookies
and positive attitudes, a good blend that
should make the Pitt Rugby Club a team «

all who know him.

But rare is it for such an ‘

event to identify a city. Each

town has its fires, ﬂoods, mass
murders and political scandals
that reeklfrom history books
2 on dusty library shelves. But
to‘have that one moment —

that one triumphant moment

to hold on to — is.rare and

cherished.
Pittsburgh has that one
moment.

In his new book “Mazl And
~ The ‘60 Bucs,” local author
Jim O’Brien chronicles the

events in the fall of 1960 that
immortalized Bill
Mazeroski in baseball lore. ,

It doesn’t take much expla-
nation, at least around these
‘parts. Only a few simple
words spoken with heart-felt
emotion:

3.-36p.m., 78 degrees.

A 2-0 pitch.

A bangi'n’slider.

Maz’s homer.

Bill Mazeroski, a man who

some say was the greatest
defensive second baseman in
history,_ clobbered Ralph
Terry’s ninth—inning offering

, the Pirates -to a 10-9 win and

sending them to their third

World Championship in histo-
ry.
The events on that Oct. 15
read like a storybook ending,
an improbable finish to an
improbable series.

Setting: Pittsburgh’s Forbes
Field, a cathedral of a ball-

~ park, immense in its dimen-

sions and dripping with leg-
endary players — Wagner,
T raynor, the Waner brothers
and Kiner.

Cast: David versus Goliath
— the Pittsburgh Pirates, base-
ball’s doormats for 35 years,
versus the mighty New York

Yankees. The New Yorkers
won 97'games that season
and owned

Pirate losses were legendary
in themselves. The Yankees
used an incredibly powerful
lineup to wallop the Bucs 16-
3, 10-0, and 12-0, in their
three wins. The Buccos
squeaked by in more tradi-
tional fashion, winning 6-4, 3-
2, and 5-2, with Vernon Law
and Harvey Haddix each col-
lecting two wins in the series.

days and over huge family

 

Terry threw with a high slid-
er.

Maz answered with a 457-
foot plus homer.

A winner.

A gamer.

The scenes of Maz circling
the bases are legendary.
Mobbed by fans and team-
mates when he landed on
home plate, Mazeroski circled
his arm in a triumphant arc as
he touched ‘em all. A tri-
umphant moment of
irrefutable glory for a city that
sorely needed a winner.

The only portion of Forbes
Field’s outfield wall that
remains is the ivy-covered

eled over and where Berra

knowing that he had been

beaten, but also knowing that
he had been a part of baseball
lore.

But despite the countless .

moments in that season,
O’Brien’s book doesn’t focus
on the season, or even the
series for that matter, but on

the scene in Pittsburgh’s col-

lege town: Oakland.

Young 7nen’stennz's team anxious

to escape Big East Conference cellar

Three rookies
set to challenge
for vacated _
starting spots;
season opens at

St. Francis

By Brady Slater '
For The Pitt News

Wielding catgut-strung rack- .

ets, the Pitt men’s tennis team
enters the new season intent
on clawing and scratching its

, way out of the conference dog-

house.

Entering the -season without
three of last year’s top six play-
ers, the Panthers will be relying
heavily on a touted cast of first—
year players to improve on last
season’s last place finish at the
Big East Conference
Championships. '

"We want to get out of last
place,” said head coach George
Dieffenbach. “That’s why we
recruited the players we did,
and why we’ll work real hard
this year.”

First-year recruits Braden
Doherty, Brad Wade and Matt
Mills all come into the season
with legitimate shots of break-
ing into the starting six before
the first match Thursday at St.

 

Francis. _

Doherty comes to Pitt as the
eighth-ranked junior player in
Ontario, Canada, while Wade is
a former WPIAL champion.

“I just want a stable place in
the starting lineup, so I can
contribute to a winning sea-
son,” Doherty said.

In addition to the recruits,
Pitt is returning Jeff Campbell,
James Chronister, David
Dumpel and Chris McShane
from last season's team, which,
despite the last-place Big East
finish, was 10-4 in head-to-
head matches.

Campbell, a senior, is the top
veteran after playing No. 4 last
season.

“We have a more cohesive
team this year,” said Campbell.
“Every person is equal on this

, team.”

With the potential of having
three first—year players in the
starting six, there is the ques-
tion of having an inexperi-
enced team. But Dieffenbach
dispels this notion.

“We have a nice combination
of experience and youth,” he
said. “Besides, the freshmen are
tough tournament competitors.
They have enough experience
to step in and play well.”

Doherty seems to believe his
coach. -
“We’re all really into it,” he
said. “It’s the first year of a new

cycle, and we’re going to work
hard at winning.”

Unlike Pitt’s revenue sports,
the tennis team doesn’t get to
play a regular season Big East
schedule. Pitt will face
Georgetown at the Pitt
Invitational in February and

. Rutgers in April, but won’t face

the other Big East teams until
the conference championships
at the end of April.

“We can’t afford to travel,”
said Campbell. “But we have a
competitive schedule outside
the conference. We’ll be
ready.”

Ready to fight its way out of
the Big East cellar? It’s going to
be a gut—check» year for the
Panther tennis program.

Buncher

Continued from page 8
Foster, Pittsburgh kept Pro
Bowl outside linebacker Greg
Lloyd from entering next year’s
free agent market by giving
him a three-year extension last
summer. When unproven line-
backer Jerrol Williams received
an oversized offer from San
Diego, the Steelers let him go
and spent their money on a
proven commodity — ex—Ram
Kevin Greene.

There is a down side to these
big-money moves, as evi-
denced when the Steelers
matched the three—year, $8.4
million offer sheet which
Tampa Bay extended to quar-

terback Neil O’Donnell.

O’Donnell seems to be the
only one who thinks he carried
the team to the playoffs last
year. Actually, he was a
mediocre _quarterback on a
good team. Now he is an over-
paid, mediocre quarterback on
a struggling team.

Whether the tendonitis in his
elbow is an excuse or not,
O’Donnell struggled in presea-
son. With the exception of the
single drive that passed for a
mini-comeback against the
49ers, he has been just as bad
in the real games.

If the injury is the reason, the
Steelers might as well rest

O’Donnell until he is healthy.
So far, he is not helping the
team. '

The problem there was the
belief that he is worth the
money. The Steelers could
have saved themselves some
cash, kept the equally mediocre
Bubby Brister and snagged a
number-one pick from Tampa
Bay to boot.

Coach Bill Cowher’s commit-
ment to O’Donnell cost the
Steelers in the playoff loss to
Buffalo last year and is still
costing them. Still, it is part of a
positive trend of Pittsburgh
spending the money to com-
pete with the rest of the NFL.

The Steelers began what may
or may not be a move back to
the top last season. Unlike the
Pirates’ situation, the fate of the
football occupants of Three
Rivers Stadium will be decided
on the field, not at the bank.

BRADY BITS: After Sunday’s
loss to the Rams, one important
question lingers — did Sean
Gilbert learn to dance like that
in Oakland’ .

-Another question — do you
think we could get him to
come back? Didn’t think so.

°Bobby Hebert turned up
the quarterback controversy
knob with a late comeback
against New Orleans Sunday.
Saint kicker Morten Anderson
nullified the comeback with a
game—winning kick as time ran
out, but the Cajun Cannon
(Hebert for those of you who
did not know" or care.) is show-
ing he could be the man to
lead the Falcons.

I What Atlanta needs to see is
whether Hebert or Chris Miller
is the right leader on thefield,
Jerry Glanville is the wrong
man on the sidelines.

°The Emmitt Smith-less
Cowboys are 0-2, and is it just
me, or can you just feel Jerry
Jones’ wallet getting lighter.
-Therewere actually newspa-
per stories about a Major
League Baseball game being
called due to snow in
Colorado. Wow, you mean it
snows in Denver?

-Sticking to baseball, some-
body is hearing footsteps in
Philadelphia. C’est les Expos!
The Phillies just can’t do any-
thing the easy way. The Giants
frittered away their advantage
in the NL West. Montreal is

    “

  

making a last-minute move in
the East. Texas is chasing down
Chicago in the AL West. All-Star
studded Toronto still hasn’t run
off with the crown in the East.
Call 1993 the Year of the
Blown Lead.

-Speaking of Toronto, those
of you enjoying the race in the
AL East should send your thank
you notes to Blue Jay Manager
Cito Gaston. Supreme talent
may win out as it did last year
for Toronto, but Gaston’s gaffes
have made it close.

No excuses now. The Blue
Jay pitching has been bad, but
New York and Baltimore
haven’t been much better, and
they are right in the race. The
Jays have a devastating lineup
but don’t get devastating
results.

Maybe moves such as using
Devon White, who walks about
as often as some dead people,
as the leadoff man instead of
Paul Molitor or Bobby Alomar
have something to do with it.

Trading for Rickey
Henderson solved the problem.
Nobody could have screwed
that up, but Gaston tried. He
put a slumping White in the
number two spot and dropped
Molitor to the number six slot.
John‘ Olerud leads the AL in
hitting and Molitor is second,
but Gaston had them batting
fifth and sixth.

Hmmm

comments on the Pitt football

said of his focusing. “It
really didn’t matter who
I did the coaching.”

With his more deter-
mined mind, Martin did

everything for the
Panthers in their opener
against Southern
Mississippi.

Scoring both Pitt touch-
downs, the first on a one-
yard jaunt and the other
on a nine—yard swing
pass, Martin stunned the
Golden Eagles.

In game two against a
tough Virginia Tech
team, things were a little
different.

“Virginia Tech came ‘in
with a good defensive
scheme,” Martin said.
“They put eight men on
the line of scrimmage
and it was tough to run
against them.”

«Until the second half
that is.

With the score well out
of Pitt’s reach, Martin
burst through one of the
few Hokie defensive’
holes and then seemed to
be stopped dead in his
tracks. But he didn’t quit
and broke free for a 51-
yard touchdown scam-
per.

“I knew something was
going to happen,” Martin
said about his run. “But it
was too late.”

The season, however,
is not. Especially if Martin
keeps racking up the
yardage.

“As of yesterday I
didn’t know how many
yards I had [in the first
two games],” Martin said.
“Somebody had to tell
me.”

Now tl1at’s focused.
