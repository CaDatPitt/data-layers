Ball Committee by George P.

After two hours of fun, dancing,
and tuneful melodies had been run
oﬁ for their .a.pproval,’the audience
agreed that “The Silver Domino”
would probably be the brightest
spot in twenty-ﬁve years of Cap
and Gown history.

It was a bit rough shod on the
edges last night, perhaps, but when
Bill Marlatt uses this week-end to
round an uncertain chorus number
or two into shape, the show is
bound to have a. smooth perform-
ance next week.

The Shrine audience went out
whistling a coupleof tunes, “Nertz
About You,’/’ and “Take a Little
Walk,” that are going to -be heard
a lot from fraternity house pianos
duringthe rest of the school year.
And, depression to the contrary,
the show last nightseemed from
a scenic and costuming standpoint
to be the’ most ambiious undertak-
ing Cap and Gown has done. The
show will be repeated at the
Mosque ‘tonight.
End of Rehearsals

-Then, seven, weeks of rehearsal,
routine drilling, and anticipation
will culminate Monday evening
when the show opens its week’s
run at the Nixon. The opening
night audience will be one of the
most colorful of the year, with the
Civic Club of Allegheny County
again sponsoring the show for the
third consecutive year. Including
among its membership some of-the
most prominent of Pittsburgh’s so-
cial ﬁgures, the Club is expected to
ﬁll the Nixon.

This year’s show, described as a
“musical masquerade in two acts"
and twelve scenes, has more than
100 men in the company. The book
and lyrics were written by Louis
M. Fushan, ’23, and G. Norman
Reis, ’16. Music was composed by
Gus A. Schnabel, ’19, and Dr. Ben-
jamin Levant, ’15. Additional tunes
were contributed by John St. Peter,
a featured player in" last year’s
production.

William Marlatt, who has staged
the -immediate past two shows,
“Manhattan Preferred” and
“What’s Up,” also directed “The
Silver Domino."

The show opens with a scene. in
a New York pent house, and before
the rather “surprise” finale, the au-
dience has been taken on a quick
swing around the world, stopping
for a Spanish fiesta, Venetian car-
nival, and a scene or two in the
African jungle.

The St01”Y concerns a rich eccen-
tric and his beautiful young ward,
whom he takes on a world cruise.

ducers goalong as managers of

Council Makes Exception
For R. O. T. C. Affair

Recinding the action of Student
Relations committee, Student
Council, at its meeting Wednesday
night, provided that no restriction

should be placed on the attendance:

at the Military Ball next year.

Following the recent Military
dance, Student Relations Commit-
tee had passed a blanket motion
that no University dance event
should be attended by more than
700 couples.

In, offering a motion excepting
the Military Ball from this limita-
tion, ‘Franklin Kallfelz, Eng. ’33,
maintained that in the military de-
partment alone, more than 900
students will probably be enrolled
next year. ,

Frank Yellig, Mines ‘$2, strenu-
ously opposed the motion to
change the rule of Student Rela-
tions committee and sought to ef-
fect a compromise by submitting a
motion that the limit on the Mill-
tary dance be raised to 900, the
R. O. T. C. enrollment total. This
motion, however, was voted down
by a secret ballot.

More than 1200 couples attended
the recent Military Ball which has
been subjected to criticism by both
alumni and students because of the

To Give Formal Program
In Morningside Church

The Women's Glee Club plans an-
other formal appearance Thursday

16, at 8:15 o'clock in the Morning-
side Methodist Episcopal Church.
The general program includes num-
bers by the chorus, readings, vocal
solos, dances and selections by the
Glee Club octette.

Among the numbers to be sung
by the chorus are: “Rosebud,” “Am-
aryllis," “Thou Art the Night Wind”
and two folk songs; “Wake Thee
Now Dearest,” and “Dark Eyes."
The octette will sing, “Blue Dan-
ube,” and “Passepied."

Among the special features is a
reading by Betty Quarrie, Col. '34;
two solos by Betty Bartley, Col. '32;

credit, having the same classiﬁca-
tion as the man dropped, shall take
his place.

Powers of Council, its purpose,
and officers were left unchanged
in the amendments as adopted.

The amendments were first pro-
posed at a special meeting called
Monday afternoon, on the petition
of five members of Council. This
action followed a referendum in
the Dental school on the question
of whether or not members ‘of that
school should’ withdraw entirely
from campus activities. The refer-
endum was defeated by a narrow
margin, the Dénts deciding that it
would be better to wait and watch
further developments in the hectic
ﬁght over reorganization of the
governing body.

An ultimatum signed by eight
students in the School of Engineer-
ing demanding that Council revise
its organization before April 13,
.with the implication that if it did
]not do so the Engineering School
would no longer consider it the
governing body, but would abide
only by divisions of the Engineer-
ing School Cabinet, also impelled
Council to immediate action. It
was understood that’ the amend-
ments, providing for equal repre-
sentation, had the support of the
Engineers, particularly since they
were formulated largely by their
representative in Council, Franklin
Kallfelz.

Paul Looms
Chess Victor

Expected To Recapture
1929-30 Laurels

 

 

Milton Paul, the inveterate Pitt
chess player, who won the Univer-
sity championships in 1929 and
1930, is expected by observers of
the present Chess Club invitation
tournament to capture first honors
again this year.

Paul has been one of the ablest
of the Pitt team in the matches
played during the highly successful
season just concluded. He has con-
tinued his excellent playing in this
tournament, although he has met
with two defeats, both administer-
ed by Roger Ilsley, present runner-
up in the standing.

The Pitt Chess Club, after sever-
al seasons of rather unsuccessful
effort to remain organized, has be-
come an intact and firmly estab-
lished body this year. Reorganized
by the Pitt “Y" at the start of the
year, it soon elected oﬁicers, and
has since functioned of its own ac-
cord. Invitations to the tourna-
ment were made by the club on
the basis of the showing made by
the players on the challenge rank-
ings. The matches are being con-
ducted in round robin style, each
player meeting all others in two
games.

The present standing of the con-
testants is listed below:

Newman Club Schedules

‘With the Activities Training In-

source of interest and enthusiasm
to the women who supervised it

seems to be every assurance that
W. S. G. A.’s newest project will
be continued next year.

ed the hope that it will become a
tradition.

During the last laboratory held‘
Friday afternoon, the women were
given an opportunity to suggest
ways in which the Institute might
be improved. Outstanding criti-
cisms made were that no invita-
tions be sent out next year so that
those who did not receive them
might not hesitate to attend. An-
other suggestion made was that
the Institute be arranged so as to
prevent attendants from missing
two days of. classes. The answer
made to this however, was that the
Institute itself was of an academic
nature and that only-‘women-whose

April showers (and snows) may
mean May ﬂowers to some people,
but they mean only muddy or
frozen workouts at Trees Field to
the Pitt gridders. In spite of the
rain and cold, the coaches are put-
ing the men through light drills
which are scarely more than lim-
bering-up settos. The players have
remarkable spirit, even though the
weather has knocked about two
weeks ofppractice out of the ses-
sions inaugurated six weeks ago.

Scout Says:

Now that all the hub-bub has subsided and people are in a better
frame of mind to consider the major problems of the country from a
more neutral standpoint, it behooves us this week just as it does every
other week to quit Winchelling on the athletes and to ﬂoat opinions
on the new basketball rules as they effect one who knows but who
has a tough time convincing anyone else that he does. Before going
further, however, we would like to explain that “ﬂoat” was used above
because the opinions of the past have usually turned out to be bubbles.
One of the boys on a downtown rag last year, Bob Hughes to be
speciﬁc, raked yours truly over the coals, or was it coke, because we
took exception to his remarks about the Pitt basketball team, we
said that the spectators be damned. We didn't use profanity then, but

remain on his feet until his man is
out of the play. Then too, Pitt. es-
capes the rule aimed at the illegal
use of the hands because the Suth-
erland system never has advocated
extensive use of the hands.
However, one rule which might
change football a. little is the one
which calls the ball dead when any
part of the runner’s body, except his
hands or; knees, touches thg ground.
’ “This'r'ul'e tends to’ take a great

American guard at Pitt in 1929.

system in the pavilion. We thought that if the spectator didn't
like the heat, or lack of it, he didn't have to attend games. We
still think so.

The coaches, however, at their annual meeting were think-
ing of the spectators. After all, if there weren’t any spectators,
there, wouldn't be any pay check, and even basketball coaches
must have'money although publicity men say that they eat,
sleep and drink basketball. That should cover the necessities
of life, but publicity men are that way.

Going back a little further, vlﬂ remember the opening of
the 1929-'30 basketball season here. Musklngum was Pitt’: op-
ponent; and with little doubt existing as to the ultimate result
of the game, the coaches of the two teams decided to try a
new plan in the second half. Instead of having a toss up at
center following each score, the team scored against was given
the ball on an out-of-bounds play under its own basket. The
innovation speeded up the game, but to such an extent that
Carlson who was endeavoring to have the rule considered by
the rules committee gave it up because ‘it demanded too much

This clinic will be in keeping

Other features include exception-

lhurdlers comparatively weak.

The 100 yard dash will be han-
dled by Harris, Milligan, and Vi-

ternate. Harris, Keller, and either
Milligan or Vitulla will run in the

By virtue of Delle1o’s two has-

Timinons and Dailey, the Kappa
Sigs reduced the lead of the Tech
champions to a mere three points
with the third period ending 15-12
in favor of Englebrecht Hall.

 

Shortly afterward Timmons and
Dailey broke through with a cou-
ple of two pointers, with less than
three minutes to go, as Tech called
for a time out. With but forty sec-
onds left, Burke of Tech, fonnd the
hoop for two points which brought
his team within two points of tie-

the game ended, 22-18, with the
trophy secure in the hands of the

Give It A Chance

 

HE PITT STUDENT is “soaking wet.”
« That is the interpretation placed by a Pittsburgh newspaper on

the Prohibition modiﬁcation plank adopted by deiegates to the

model political convention, last week. _

Exception is taken to this conclusion and in actual practice, it

is believed that an investigation would show that the Pitt student

idle boast, but is based on observations made at University dances
and various fraternity functions.

In sentiment, however, there is no denying the fact that tllie
Pitt student lsrill line with his college brethren throughout t e
country and’ is wet, almost rabidly so. Indeed, the act ofan over-
whelming majority at the convention in tossing out in quick _((;rd:1:
the prohibition committee's majority recommendation for rxgl e

'0 ‘I forcement and in adopting the minority recommendation for com-

lete abolition of the dry laws is indicative of the strong feeling
ggainst the Eighteenth Amendment. So intense was the wet senti-
ment that the Prohibition plank. was the only part of the coi(11veu-
tion platform that failed to receive a. fair and adequate consi era-
tion by the delegates. - _
For a long time college undergraduates have been struggling
under the burden of obeying the Eighteenth Amendment and the

 Volstead Act. ‘One questions, however, if this student opposition

' b ontaneous reaction.’ There is a strong suspicion that
élgghagesnoiigiliiized wets have made capital out of the college indi-

P' I S vidual. He has been the victim of a high-pressure propaganda pro-

 

gmmWets know that for better or for worse, the college man of to-
day and there are over a million of them, will be the leaders of to-
morrow. “It is incumbent on the anti-prohibitionists, therefore, to
plant the seeds of dissatisfaction in the hands of present-day un-
dergraduates. - . _ ,

Most college students are totally unfamiliar with tie Sltéllgtelgél
that existed prior to the passage of the Elglli‘.ee‘I‘l%5l t 316: cm”-
They see only the direful aspect of a law that the e s S Y

be enforced, and which newspapers, motion pictures, and the radio ,

hold up to youth as the great American plague. Prohibition has not
been given a fair chance with the college student.

 . .Order Out of Chaos,

 UT or CHAOS has come order!
No. one could have foreseen the remarkable political develop-

S ments that have taken place on the campus during: the 113311 Week-

Indeed, if one had’ ventured such a prediction seven days ago, he
would have been adjudged, at least, temporarily insane.

Strange things happen in politics, but there is no stranger sight
than that of erstwhile irreconcilable opponents now assiduously co-
operating on a form of government that is undoubtedly the anti-
'tbesis of the attitude held originally-by them both 0119 might add»

 that such a spectacle is also satisfying. ,

The new plan of student government, as adopted by Council,
Wednesday night, harks back to the days of the old Student Senate,

- overseer of undergraduate activities more than a decade ago. This

body was succeeded by Student Council which has held sway, de-
spite a-continued loss of _power and prestige until of late years, the
body has dwindled into little else but a group interested in pol tica
patronage.

 The plari of equal representation in the campus legislative or-
, .

ganizatlon, as adopted this week, may be contrary to the doctrines‘
of a. course in political science which preaches the dogma Of PTO-
portional representation, but at Pitt equal representation would
seem to be the only practical solution to a troublesome question.
It is more important to adjust the political organization to meet an

. existing emergency, than it is to follow a system, no matter how

theoretically practical it may appeal‘- ,_

Under the plan of equal representation every school will sgare
in the government. Such was not always the case when Stu 8!!
Council ruled.‘ With equal representation, it will no longer be pos-
sible for any one school to hold a preponderance of power and with
it the extra-legal authority to dictate the membership and 130110165
of the entire legislative organization. Under the new plan, also,
there need be no further hue and cry over illegal voting methods,
for each school may cast its vote in any waygthat meets its con-

. venience.

This compromise had to come. Petitions and referendums
might have gone on eternally with the same results every time. It
is a tribute to all parties concerned that just when clouds looked
darkest, they have met in good faith, composed their differences,
and evolved the new order of government.

The campus can relax once more!

Presidential Poll ,

HE RECENT POLL on presidential aspirants of the two major

parties, as conducted by the Pitt Weekly, met with commend-
able success. The interest shown by students and faculty members
and the serious attitude maintained in the balloting were praise-
worth .

There have been criticisms, however, criticisms that for the
most part are without foundation. It has been held that the poll
was unfair in that no opportunity wasgiven for ‘adherents to the
(slfdcialist and Communist parties to express their choice of can-

ates.

These critics, have evidently failed to see that the straw vote
was not an election, but merely an attempt to ascertain student
sentiment on the numerous candidates that are contesting for the
Republican and Democratic nominations. There is no contest in
the Communist and Socialist parties. William Z. Foster has been
tacitly granted the nomination of the former party, and it is gen-
erally recognized that Norman Thomas will again lead the So-
cialists.

, Model Political Convention ap-
proved a platform of ten Utopian
planks Sunday evening.

The‘ liberal group, headed by
Saul Shapira and Saul Welsberg,
Col. '34; -‘William Buttei-bach, Col.
'33 ; and Irving D. Robbins, Col. '35,
succeeded in passing virtually all
of the more radical elements of the
platform. ~

The only instance in which the
conservative group, which was led
by Cyril Jacobs, Bus. Ad. '32; John
Bracken, Col. '34; Abraham Bon-
der, Col. '34; and Rudolph Morgan,
Col. '34, succeeded in mustering a
majority was in the case of na-
tional defense. After orders of the
day had been set aside ﬁve times,
the convention voted to a tie on
the question of building up the bat-
tleship and aircraft forces. Acting
Chairman Morgan's “Yes” assured
the planks retention.

In spite of the pre-convention
dissention and talk of disbandment,
virtually all the insurgent dele-
gates were present at both the
committee meetings and the gen-
eral convention to lend their sup-
port to the passage of the liberal
platform.

The three-day "convention was
opened Friday evening with ad-

dresses by John Townley, John
Morrow, and Mark Shields, poli-
of the Pittsburgh
Press, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and
Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph.

Saturday the delegates met in
committees and drew up, with the
«technical assistance of faculty
members, the planks which they
presented to the convention the
following day.
