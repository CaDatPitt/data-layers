Newspaper Reporting
Of Labor Events

Shows Distortion

 

OFFICIAL STUDENT TRI-WEEKLY PUBLICATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

 

 

 

 

By ROBERT SAFFRON

You can blabber all you want
about the glorious tradition of
America ’s free and unkept
press, but its reporting of labor
news has now become its own
indictment.

To begin with, newspapers were
caught short on qualiﬁed labor re-
porters at the beginning of the
unionizational upsurge after the
NRA. Police reporters, society re-
porters, and sob sisters become ex-
pert observers of the union scene.

The everyday constructive work
of unions went unnoticed and only

the strikes and violence were
played up, since these were
“alive,” sensational, hot stuff.

(And they were so because vio-
lence was unusual and infre-
quent.)

From the very ﬁrst, newspaper
publishers resisted the organiza-

: tion of their editorial employees,

most of whom were working for
day laborers’ wages, on the theory
that membership in the American

‘Newspaper Guild would destroy

freedom of the press and objective
reporting of the news.
Employers Biased.

But the guild has been recruit-
ing men by the thousands and to-
day the reactionary publishers, if
they ever were open—minded to-
ward unions, ﬁnd it a bitter pill to
print the news fairly, when unions
in their own house have made
them cough up living wages.

An example of this obviously
intentional distortion of news
slightly favorable to labor is this
series of wire reports by the Unit-
ed Press, quoted in the Guild Re-
porter, organ of the ANG. The
UP corrected its error in two

hours and 21 minutes.

.At the present time the United
States Chamber of_ Commerce,
through its magazine Nation’s
Business, is buying quarter-page
advertisements in smaller dailies
and Weeklies throughout the coun-
try. These ads subtly explain the
omniscience of all businessmen
and the unnecessary disturbance
of the normal ﬂow of trade by
outside unions.

Eziitors Take Hint

The editors of these sheets usu-
ally take the hint to keep their
editorial policy in line with that
of the ads. They know they .Will
lose this proﬁtable income if they
do not. .

The National Association of
Manufacturers sends out its mes-
sage through the Six Star Syndi-
cate. This material consists main-
ly of columns? written‘ by eight
college professors and is sent free
to whatever papers will print
them. The profs interpret current
economic and political trends with
a vicious“anti—union slant.

And one of these writers is Wal- .

ter a Spahr, editor of Economic
Principles and Problems, textbook
used last year in the course at the
University.

By NORMAN GIBSON

One of the most colorful and
dixersiﬁed exiiibitions to visit
the dcpartincnt of fine arts is
the American Handicrafts sec-
tion of the 1937 Paris Interna-
tional Exhibition, now on dis-
play in the seve,ptl1 ﬂoor gal-
lcrics.

The show, which is to con-
tinue until March 28, has samples
of pottery, glass ceramics, wood-
carving, puppets, metalwork,
weaving, and jewelry, designed by
some of the most outstanding
American craftsmen. ‘

An animal group of unusual

vmerit includes Victor Schrecken-

gost’s “Young~Pegasus,” done in a
white glazed slip over a red-
brown base, and the austere green
Colt and the dull, sombre, black
panther created by Paul Bogatay.
Schreckengost has added youth-
ful Vigor and strength to his myth-
ical horse;
PUPPETS POPULAR

The life-like puppets of Mary
l\/Iinnick Grofe are a popular fa-
vorite. Four farmer ﬁgures, each
about 22 inches high, dressed in
realistic costume, are arranged to
suggest a country jig. .

The beaten copper fruit bowl
enameled with cobalt blue, done
by Harold Tishler is an outstand-
ing piece in the pottery group.
The simplicity of the design is
emphasized by the narrow strip
of gold trimming on the rim. >
 The pottery -on display is in the
form of dishes, bowls, urns, bot-
tles, and vases. The color group
composed of red bowl done by
Lili Shapiro; the light olive green
bowl by Aloys Sacksteader; and
the lustre Cat plate by Helen
Clark Phillips, serves as an inter-

« esting study in shade contrast.

Russell Aitken is represented in
the ceramic group with “Cactus
Kid”—-‘a mounted cowboy -with
ten—gallon hat and six-shooter,

‘Band Members

To Play On ice
At Puck Game

As the highlight of a crowded
week of musical activities, 25
members of the University Band
will go through special formations
on ice skates between periods of
the Pitt—Carnegie Tech hockey
game Saturday evening.

This will mark the first time
that any college band has ever ap-
peared on skates.

The formation will include a
“C” for Tech, followed by a “P”
for Pitt. While in formation, the
25 skaters will play the music,
but on entering and leaving the
ice, the rest of the band, which
is to remain in the stands during
the exhibition, will furnish the
music.

Included in the skating band
will be two bass horns and two
drums. According to manager A.
E. Bauman, “it is a difficult feat
to skate and play these instru-
ments at the same time.”

The skaters will be led through
their formations by coed captain
Mary “Sonja” Whitney. ,

Tomorrow afternoon, the band

Let Us Be Your
Quarterback, Jock

CCORDING to downtown newspapers, Dr.
John Bain (Jock) Sutherland, generally
recognized as the the top football coach in the
country over a span of years, has been offered
the Lieutenant—Governorship noinination of the
Republican party.

First published by a. “Republican” paper,
the rumor seems _well founded in view of the
fact that both Republican camps, the Pinchot
and the James —candidacies, are favorable to
Sutherland.

VVe understand that Dr. Sutherland has
answered “I ama football coach,” which is al-
most as indeﬁnite as saying “I do not choose
to run.” And so, as a basis for helping Dr.
Sutherland in hisﬁnal decision, if the situa-

'tion is not completely settled, may we offer
these salient points for his consideration.

1. One doesn’t have to have too much on
the ball to be a. lieutenant governor. Prac-
tically anyone could handle the job.

2. To be considered one of the best foot-
ball coaches in the country, is a position few
men can hold.

3. If you accept the Republican nomina-
tion for Lieutenant Governor, and are elect-
ed, you can no longer coach football teams
in this University, according to the principles
laid down by the University in the Hovde .
case, which provides that no one teaching
at the University may hold an outside posi-
tion. ~~ ‘

4. In entering a political campaign, you
subject yourself to all sorts of malicious po-
litical tricks.

5. The student body, the alumni, and your
fellow faculty men, generally, would hate
to see you leave‘ this University.

And ﬁnally, we do_ not believe that you
should allow the ‘Republican party to capital-
ize on your fame as 3. highly popular, and
highly successful football coach. Let some-
one else run their interference —— someone
slow with whom they can keep up.

Cultural Check-Up Tests
Could Beneﬁt Seniors

it  usually granted that acquisition of a
?broad and sound cultural background is one
of the aims of a student in college, yet few are
ever given an opportunity to measure their own
success or failure in this effort. This year
lrown university is giving its seniors “coin-
pi-clieiisive inventory” tests. Henry M. Wris-
toii, president of Brown, explains the tests as
“an attempt to measure what students know
today rather than what they have known—

I what they have retained and have available as

current resources.” _

The purpose of the tests, orginally drafted
bv the Carnegie Foundation for the Advance-
nientcof Teaching, is to.check .up on students’
general knowledge. But used in congunction
with the inventory tests ‘IS the Strong voca-
tional interest questionnaire, so that students
may discover, in addition to their intellectual
background, the vocations for which they are
best adapted. - .

The inventory tests appa.rently are very sim-
ilar to the sophomore culture tests given to
Arts college students at Minnesota. They cov-
er verbal aptitude, knowledge of aforeign
language, mathematics, physical and biological
sciences. social studies, literature and the arts.

’ though the senior year is a little late to
di. ver the vocational leanings of a student,
the :check-up idea is a valuable one. VVhile the
system at Brown does measure what‘ the stu-
dent. has retained from 4 years of college, it

Nationalism:
By Joseph 1l{cC1osky

Immediately following the Treaty of Versailles, with its
provisions for a Lcagueof Natioiis, a mandate «system, and local
self-determination, the optimists were predicting a new era of
peace in which all of the best aspects of nationalism should have
ful.l sway without giving vent to those emotional expressions of

The old bug-a-boo about the Third
International plotting the end of
democracy in the world today
elicits more laughs than fears.
_Moreover, the rise of Hitler has
led European diplomats to turn
to Stalin, possibly as the lesser of
two evils; at any rate, Russian
prestige has increased notably,
and Stalin has handled the situa-
tion skillfully. For him to en-

lengthmovie, Snow White and the
Seven - Dwa7‘fs, has critics all
over the country going superla-
tive and agreeing unanimously
that it is nothing short of stu-
pendous. r

For in this bewitching movie
fantasy, Mr. Disney has created a
masterpiece that rightfully belongs
in any listing of the best movies
of the century. In fact it belongs
at the top of the list.

Much of the effect in the pic-
ture is achieved by the coloring.
With an ingenious use of color
changes and shadings Mr. Disney
has succeeded in building up and
accenting the moods of the scenes.

No review— of Snow White
would be complete without men-
tioning the dwarfs and in particu-
lar, Dopey. Dopey is the lop-
eared little fellow who combines
all the poignant wistfulness of a
Charlie Chaplin with a stumbling,
blundering happy—go-luckiness all
his own.

Poor Dopey brings up the rear

~ in every procession. He can’t talk

because “he never tried,” and he
always manages to get directly in
the path of Sneezy’s cyclonic ex-
plosions. Whether or not his
creator intended him to be the star
doesn’t matter in the least, because
he goes right ahead and captures
the heart of everyone anyway.
And of the other dwarfs: Doc
who gets his Words twisted a la

but his latest ventures, the ful'.%
xtoy Atwell; Happy, who perpetu-'

ally bubbles over with good na-
ture; Sleepy, who can’t seem to

keep awake very long at a time;.

Bashful, who turns a beautiful
crimson at the slightest provoca-
tion; Sneezy, whom we have al-
ready mentioned; and the scroogy
one Grumpy; each contributes his
little bit to the mosaic of the
story.

Everyone seems to agree that
the prince, mostly because his
movements are slightly jerky, is
the one noticeable ﬂaw in the ﬁlm.
But since he has such a minor
part, it really doesn’t make much
difference. Anyway his singing
voice is compensation for any de-
feet in his makeup. And while
we are on the subject of voices,
we think the queen, in spite of her
being such a bad person, has a
beautiful voice. We liked it bet-
ter than Snow White’s.

We hope that no child old
enough to read fairy tales will
miss this picture because his par-
ents think he will be frightened.
Undoubtedly some of the scenes
are a little frightening, but cer-
tainly the beauty of the ﬁnal
scenes overbalances the
giuesome details in the queen’s
workshop. After all, make-be-
lieve is familiar to every child,
and he can understand it perhaps
better than some of the things in
his World of reality.

For The Very Young

By Milton G.

In which the Author, in the Midst of Inspiration, is
confronted by the Ghouls of his Creation.

The author mowed his ﬁngers through his hair,
And, puffed a bit upon his mecrschaum pipe,

And then declared aloud: “Well, I don’t care,
You characters must really fit my type.”

The hero spoke: “Pd like to say I wish
You’d rather let me keep my self-respect.
You make me mumble like a senseless ﬁsh,
You make me chatter. That’s where I object.

The heroine proclaimed: “Now, really, sir,

A girl in love would never act that way:
She wouldn’t run when one has glanced at her, 
She wouldn’t blush—for blushing is passe.” I

The author swore: “Be quiet! While I slave
To recreate you.will you please behave?”

An Impression
Is Corrected

By LEONARD LEVISON

Correction: Discussing Glenn
Cunningham ’s record run over
perfect indoor

‘course last week, we made the
;statement that even Cunning-
{ham himself must have been sur-

_-prised at his time.

This was in

-error. For, although, he was in a

=-deﬁnite minority in his reaction,

Cunningham was not surprised.
We have the information direct
from Lynn Callaway, the very ca-
pable sports editor of “The Dart-
mouth,” who interviewed Cun-
ningham in the dressing room right
after he stepped oﬁ of the track
in Dartmouth’s Alumni Gym. Ac-
cording to Mr. Callaway, Cunning-
ham said, “I thought it would be
about 4:05, as that second quarter
was a little slow. I wasn’t sur-

prised at the time, however. The
conditions were excellent.”

Coaches Agree

Substantiation: It was revealed
yesterday that the city basketball
«coaches are partially in accord
with the selection of the All-City
basketball ﬁve that the News’
hardwood critics picked. The tab-
ulated selection of Dr. Carlson,
"Davies, and Hannum included
Miller, Zeleznik, Stark, Johnson,
and Kreiling. The only differen-
tiation was that of Duquesne’s
“Pickles” Kreiling, -left - v off » the
News’ team in favor of the Bluff-
ites’ Joe O’Malley. Signicant fac-
tor in the election .was the ballot
-of Coach Chick Davies, who rated
O’lVialley above Kreiling in deﬁn-

ing the relative merits of his
players. V
Four Minutes

Wishful prediction: When it

comes to running a four minute
mile, there is only one man who
will be able to do it. And he will
accomplish it before his career is
ﬁnished. The runner, of course,
is Pitt’s Johnny Woodruff, now
the greatest half miler in the
world. Our belief in this point is
bolstered considerably by track
coach Carl Olson.

McBride, Scott ’
Made Varsity
Grid Managers

William McBride, C39,”has been

appointed senior varsity football
manager and Frank Scott, C39, se-
nior manager of equipment, for
the coming football season, it was
announced yesterday by James A.
Hagan, director of athletics.
‘ ‘These appointments were made
on the eve of the opening of spring
football practice so that the mana-
gers would be able to assume their
duties immediately. The short
spring drills will open Monday.

McBride succeeds Al Barr,
BA38. He has been an assistant
manager for the past three years.
A member of Phi Kappa social
fraternity, McBride’s other campus
activity has been on the business
staff of Cap and Gown.

The position as manager of
equipment that Scott assumes is
newly-created this year. Scott
will have complete student direc-
tion of and responsibility for the
gridiron equipment. One of the
major reasons for the establish-
ment of this type of managership
is the fact that a new equipment
custodian is to be installed this,

get a tie.
Changes are
very likely to
be made in the
starting line and
perhaps in the
defense if the
boys don’t start to perk up be-
fore the Carnegie Tech game Sat-
urday night. 5
The team as a whole, however,
except for the few offending gen-
tlemen, have the right spirit and.
are determined to catch the Dukes’
a well nigh impossible task, inci-
dentally. '

, DUKES MUST LOSE

The situation is’ this: Duquesne
mustlose one game for the, Pitt-
men to gain a tie, and the Panthers
are in far more danger of losing
than are the Bluffmen.

Duquesne has only two games
left, one with Fenn and the "other
with Western Reserve. The Dukes
have defeated both of these out-
ﬁts and there is no reason why
they shouldn’t do it again.

Pitt, however, must play three
games—Tech, Fenn and John Car-
roll——with all odds against them
winning over the Carrolls. Mc-

 

Captain Bob

Sorley’s strategy is to take the ﬁrst h
two games in stride and perhaps 1

experiment a little, meanwhile
aiming for the all-important John
Carroll’s.

“But the whole thing,” says Me-1

Sorley, “won’t matter too much,

— because of the quaint _hockey cus-

tom of playoffs.”
TWO IN PLAY-OFFS

Present plans, 1' which are only
tentative, call for the first two
teams in each of the two divisions
to have a playoff game after the
regular season, the winners of
these games to meet for the cham-
pionship. _

This would pit the Dukes and
Panthers against each other in the
eastern division and John Carroll
against Western Reserve in the

By BERT J AFFEE

Tonight’s battle royal, or vice
versa, between the Phi Kaps and
Pi Kappa Alpha will go a long
way in determining the winner of
League A in the Interfraternity
baskeball circle.

Both teams have been impres-

sive in previous engagements, and
there is little to choose from be-
tween them. However, if any
edge is to be conceded to either
club, the Phi Kaps would be the
probable choice because of size.

RECORDS SAME

Pi Kappa Alpha looked unbeat-
able in its ﬁrst two starts, trounc-
ing the Delts, 31-19, and _the Phi
Eps, 50-9. Intheir last encounter
the Pi KA’s humbled the Lambda
Chi Alpha’s in a close game, 15-13.
PhiKappa breezed through Lamb-
da Chi in its inaugural, 32-15, and
in the second game, against the

victorious, 24 to‘ 23. ‘ ‘ The Phi
Gamsiin their most recent game
conquered the Phi Eps 43 to 27,1
with a spirited second half rally. 

Comparative scores fail to show
superiority for either side. The
Phi Kap’s have totaled 104 points,
with Dandy Dick Cassiano leading
the attack. The Pi Kappa Alpha’s,
lead by George Davies, "have an-
nexed 96 markers.

team’s showing in last Satur-
day’s IC4A meet, Coach Olson
thinks Pitt ‘stands a good
chance to win the title next
Saturclay in South Bend at the
Central lntercollegiates, but
temporizes his predictions with
1-1 couple of ifs. If Notre Dame had
a weaker team and if Ken Ryden
was in condition to leap hurdles,
Olson wouldn’t have to temporize.

Pitt’s crack relay team showed
their heels to
NYU’s team, one
of the best,
Saturday at the

lead and then
handed the ba-
ton to striding

l satisfied with the track¢

the shot—put. Frank Ryan, Colum-
bia’s world record holder, took

ﬁrst and a couple other veteran,

weight men clogged second and
third. The other Pitt entries were
erased in the early heats.
Meanwhile Notre Dame, Pitt’s
main threat to the Central Inter-
collegiates, spent last Saturday
making a strong showing in one
of the Big Ten meets. N otre Dame
is strong in all events and has a
very well balanced squad. Their
mile relay team is one of the best
in the Mid—West. The Panther re-
lay team will have to keep mov-
ing that baton around very, very
fast or follow the South Benders

IC4A. McKee, , to the wire.

Olson will probably take the
same squad to South Bend that

made the New York trip. Frank
Ohl, Al Ferrara,.Al McKee, John-
ny, Woodruff, Ed Routsh, John
Bazyk, and Captain Dick Mason

will board‘ the west—bound choo-

choo.

For the ﬁrst time since the Mill-

rose games, held during the middle
of February, Johnny Woodruff will

essay the half-mile run. During

Woodruif ran the anchor
against Jim Herbert, NYU half

of outrunning Herbert.

_ Wrestlers Do Something
' Besides Grunt/Ind Groan

By BILL MOELWAIN
\Vhat does a wrestler do besides wrestle?
That ’s a question that had been bothering this reporter for
some time. So, he climbed Desota St. to ﬁnd out from the boys

themselves.

In common with a great many other people, he had thought I"
in some vague Way that the wrestlers did nothing else but

wrestle, because they were too

(1) dumb, (2) tired, (3) busy

wrestling. It turns out that Pitt
matmen, at least, fail to qualify in
any one of those particulars. Ac-
tually, it seems that they are well
up in the scale
when it comes
to activities.
Bill Hoeveler
heads the list
by being prac-
tically e v e r y-
thing but an as-
sistant to the
d e a n of men.
He’s in the Cap
and Gown cast,
a very active
member of Pitt
P l a y e r s (re-
member “Fresh
Fields?”), a
Druid, and a
member of SFA Men’s Council, and
I-F Council. Last year he wore the
Blue and Gold as a track man.
He sports a Kappa Sigma frat key.

RUDY GOOD STUDENT

A grappler who sticks close to
sports for his activities is Clem
Cambal. Clem is on Jock Suth-
erland’s football squad, and has
been fairly successful in the inter-
fraternity boxing tourney. Phi
Kappa claims him as a member.

If you read the Panther, and
who doesn’t, you have noticed an
attractive young lady peering at

   

Tomarelli

‘you from the’ cover‘ of the -rebru:

ary issue.
creationof the clever pen of Frank
Kristufek, Pitt heavyweight, who
doubles in brass ’. as _a footballer.
It’s rumored that Kristufek refuses
to. do another cover for Panther
until they give him a model.

Captain Rudy Tommarelli is a
hard-working Chem Special, but
in between experiments and half
Nelsons, he ﬁnds time to get in
some high kicks as a member .of
the Cap and Gown chorus. Also,
Rudy has never missed Frank Car-
ver’s honor roll.

QUITE VERSATILE

Ray Dimit, Whitey Kosinski, and
Sandy McLeod are not quite so ac-
tive in campus affairs as their fel-
low wrestlers, but they’re not back
row boys, either. Kosinski plays
football, while McLeod and Dimit
are both fraternity men, Dimit a
Phi Gamma Delta and McLeod a
Phi Delta Theta.

Not a wrestler but still a big
help to Coach Mazeski is Manager
Joe Kristufek. His freshman
track, cross country, basketball,
and tennis letters Won him a mem-
bership in Druids. As a tennis
player, he’s almost a sure bet for
No. 1 spot on the Pitt varsity. Joe
is an amateur photographer of
merit, and takes athletic pictures
for the Owl. . . I i .

League   Oﬂicer Cites

War F ear

Sir Herbert Ames
Believes Germany

Will Take Austria

By ROBERT ADAMS

Europe is ﬁlled with an all-
consuming fear of war today,
with Adolf Hitler’s Germany
casting her shadow over the
other nations of the continent,
in the opinion of Sir Herbert
Ames, ﬁrst' treasurer of the
League of Nations, who spoke at
Inquiry Forum Monday.

Austria is almost certain to fall
before the onslaught of Nazi inﬂu-
ence, Czechoslovakia is torn by
the agitation of the pro-Hitler
German element of her population,
and Poland is blissfully living in

a “fool’s paradise,” declared Sir
Herbert.

No hope for alleviating the pres-
sure of international ill—feeling in
central Europe exists, except for
the possibility that England may
be able to satisfy some of Ger-
many’s demands by a return of
her mandated colonies to the
Reich, Sir Herbert explained in an
interview following his speech.

CHAMBERLAIN MAY WIN

“Mr. Chamberlain, the British
prime minister, is attempting to
reach some kind of an agreement
with Germany, and he is likely to
succeed,” said Sir Herbert. “I
don’t know what proportion of the
British public agrees with Cham-
berlain’s view, but I do know that,
for the time being, he will have a

free hand in trying to work out

some solution.

“Anthony Eden, who lost his
post as foreign minister during
the recent cabinet crisis, is com-
pletely out of the picture for the
present. I can’t say whether he
will have the opportunity to regain
his place if Chamberlain’s plan
fails.”

In his address on “Is Czechoslo-
vakia Worth Saving?” Sir Herbert
admitted that the League of Na-
tions was powerless to do anything
effective in the European crisis.

LEAGUE IMPOTENT

“As long as the League is not
universal, or nearly so, its power
to protect a small state against the
aggression of a large state is
slight. At present, the power of
the League is temporarily in cold
storage,” stated the former treas-
urer.

Replying to a questioner, Sir
Herbert commented, “I’ve often
wondered what would happen if
someone should put a bullet
through Hitler. I believe that the
revolution that would follow his
assassination would cause tremen-
dous suffering and loss of life.

“I hope that no one does kill
Hitler. Of course, I’m not an en-
thusiast for his form of govern-
ment, but I think it is better than
the disorder which would follow
his death.”

Czechoslovakia’s rulers are de-
termined not to allow Nazi inﬂu-
ence to gain headway in their
country, asserted Sir .Herber_t.

Business Level
Remains Same

For Past Week '

The level of business activity in
the Pittsburgh district showed no
change during the past week, ac-
cording to the Bureau of Business
Research of the University.

Contrary to the previous three
weeks, when trade showed a rapid
decline, most ﬁelds of activity
were either on the same level, or
fractional points higher. What-
ever drops there were in various
lines of activity were counterbal-
anced by rises in other ﬁelds.

Originating freight shipments
fell sharply, while industrial pro-
duction and volume of business
advanced. With allowance made
for seasonal decline, the index of
electric power production rose
slightly, coal production decreased
slightly, and iron and steel pro-
duction remained on the same lev-
el as in the preceeding week.

Using the 1923-25 average as
100, the index of business activ-
ity at the present time is rated at
61.1. This ﬁgure is .3 below that
of the preceding week, 1.8 below
the week ended February 12,
1938, and 55 points below the level
one year ago.

All ﬁgures in this survey are
adjusted to seasonal variations in
business activity, and are taken
from approximately 11 counties in
Western Pennsylvania. With the
exception of the two-week period
following the St. Patrick’s day
ﬂood in 1936, business is at the

CONNICK EXHIBITION

The stained glass pieces have
been mounted on the windows of

they may be displayed to advant-
age. The “Dante” panel from
Princeton university was done by
Charles J . Connick who is design-
ing the windows for Heinz Chapel.
His smaller panels, Locomotive,
Fountain, Pegasus, Peacock, and
Swan, illustrate the effect which
can be attained by this art.

Other pieces, “Nativity,”
Henry Lee Willet, and “Primitive
Panel” by Earl Edward Sandborn,
complete the stained glass exhibit.

An unusual bit of pottery is the
vase and lid, Noah and the Flood

inscriptions telling the story of
the ﬁgures. The white vase tinted
with brown. is alongside another
of Miss Feldman’s pieces with in-
scriptions, a yellow bread plate.

NEEDLEWORK
