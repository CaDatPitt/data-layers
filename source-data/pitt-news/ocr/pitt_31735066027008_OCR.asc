sencls Pitt
budget to

legislature

By Paul Kogut
Staff Writer

Gov. Tom Ridge surprised
and disappointed many
University of Pittsburgh offi-
cials with his first budget pro-
posal, unveiled March 7.,Much

to the chagrin of Pitt’s admin- I

istration, there is no increase
over last year. '

Ridge’s budget gives Pitt the
same amount of money for fis-
cal year 1995-96
($144,036,000) as former
Gov. Robert Casey’s budget
did for fiscal year 1994-95.
Under the Tuition Challenge
Grant Program, the school
could qualify for an extra $100
per student if any tuition,
increase next year is held to no
more than 4.5 percent. That
could amount to $1.93 million
more for Pitt.

Considering that the univer-
sity is locked in battle with a
budget deficit of $5.7 million
this spring, it’s easy to under-
stand why Ridge’s budget pro-
posal was not well received by
Pitt’s administration.

They had requested an
increase of about 6 percent or
about $8.5 million. They
didn’t get it.

“The governor’s budget
didn’t look exactly like people
thought it would,” said Ann
Dykstra, director of Pitt’s
Commonwealth Relations.
“This is definitelynot a budget
that supports public higher
education institutions, Pitt
included.”

Ben Tuchi, senior vice chan-
cellor of business and finance,
said he was “surprised” by the
governor’s proposal. “I rather
thought it wouldn’t have been

“Students are not universi-

be forced to be responsible
or compromise for the uni-
versity’s errors,” said John
Callahan, SGB member.

SGB will be sending its
recommendations to the
housing office in theihopes
that its opinion will be taken
into consideration.

Also during the meeting,
SGB announced its recom-
mendations for improve-
ments of Food Services for
the upcoming year to

increase usage of the univer-
sity food plan and‘ to support

De ortment
to old
conference

By Mary Mares
For The Pitt News

The Department of
Africana Studies is present-
ing the first conference on
black popular culture at the
University of Pittsburgh on
April 6-8. V _ ‘

The conference will fea-
ture over 30 scholars from
Pitt, Carnegie Mellon
University and other univer-
sities including UCLA and
Harvard.

Dr. Joseph Adjaye, acting
chair of the Department of
Africana Studies, said not
enough attention has been
paid to black popular cul-
ture, and that this conference
hopefully will expand
awareness and knowledge of
those cultures in Africa, the
United States and the
Caribbean.

“There is still a tendency
for people to look on black
popular culture from a
Western view, which can
create distortions. Culture is
a complex of symbols,” -he
said. .

“This is an opportunity to
penetrate and find the true
meaning behind those sym-
bols — to try to understand
the connection between cul-

,tural symbols and class,‘

power, gender and race.”
Among the keynote speak-

ers at the conference will be '

Dr. Tricia Rose, a leading
authority on rap music and
youth culture, who is fea-
tured in the April 1995 issue
of Essence magazine.

There will also be dance
performances, discussion
panels and plays.

Adjaye said he hopes stu-
dentsiwill attend ‘this confer-
ence because it “provides a
chance to interact with fac-
ulty and to seehow scholars
interpret things like rap
music.”

One student who is look-
ing forward to the confer-
ence is sophomore Janera
Solomon.

“It’s not often that there is
such a conference,” she said.
“Students should take
advantage of this opportuni-
ty. [They] areia part of cul-
ture and [should attend] for
their own research and
knowledge.”

All events are open to the
public. For more information

Pitt information system up and running

By Matt Fentress
Staff Writer

Pittlnfo has been up and
running for almost a year and
a half, but it only began to be
a useful service a few
months ago, according to the
manager of a campus com-
puting group. A

Before December 1994,
.“there just weren’t really
enough information on it to

\ make it useful to anybody,”

said Bill Fithen, manager of
the Network Information
Services Group.

Now Pittlnfo, the campus
computer information net-
work, responds to 60,000
document requests every day,
half of which come from
sources outside of the uni-
versity, said Fithen.

Pittlnfo allows you to read
through university policies
and procedures, check out
monthly campus crime statis-
tics, research scholarship

Whichever direction you decide to
take, we can help you get there in style,
with a brand new Ford or Mercury.

If you're a graduating senior, or a graduate student,
you can get $400 Cash Back or a Special A.P.R7‘*

opportunities and check
Pitt’s help-wanted board
from the comfort of your
computer terminal. Users can
also roam‘ freely through the
Internet and World Wide
Web via Pittlnfo. 1

And whether you want to
check on course availability,
read the latest issue of the
University Times, organize
your next trip with an on-line
Amtrak schedule or just
refresh your memory ‘as to
what Mayor Tom. Murphy
looks like, Pittlnfo can pro-
vide.

Amy Brenen of Computing
and Information Services
said the amount of informa-
tion on the system continues
to grow.

“You’ll just see this explo-
sion soon,” when the many

Pittlnfo areas currently under '

construction are finished,

said Brenen. ~
Brenen said the goal of Pitt

Computing and Information

. Sciences is to have every-

body at the university take
advantage of the resources
that Pittlnfo has to offer.

But are Pitt students pay-
ing attention to the resources
available to them yet?

“Computer lab usage has
just taken off, really sky-
rocketed,” said Erin Walker,
a computer lab‘ supervisor.
“There’s a lot of stuff out
there, a lot of stuff that peo-
ple don’t know about.”

“In the beginning ofthe
year, [Pittlnfo] was really
dry. There really wasn't
much reason to use it,” said
freshman computer
science/history major Greg
Economou. But now, said
Economou, “they’ve put on a
lot of more useful stuf .”

Some students, though,
were less enthusiastic.

“I’ve never heard of it,”
said senior Kevin Vaccarella.

“Pitt is expanding what
they have,” ~ said -junior

direction to take, but we can

sure help you get there.

that severe. [Also,] the tuition
challenge grant numbers are
too small to really help us.”

Pitt spokesman Ken Service
said “disappointment is the
general feeling” about the bud-
get.

But, according to Dykstra,
Tuchi and their fellow admin-
istrators, the battle of the bud-
get is not finished just yet.

They are quick to point out
that the governor’s proposal
still has to pass through the
state’s Senate and House of
Representatives.

Before the houses take their
votes, representatives from Pitt
will have their say about the
governor’s budget proposal at
two hearings, one took place
last week,. which included a
presentation by Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor

School representatives also
plan to continue “vigorously”
lobbying Harrisburg for an
increase in funding until both
houses ‘take their votes,
Dykstra said. .

After the two hearings, both
houses could vote on the bud-
get at any time up until June
30, the end of ﬁscal year 1995.
They could even vote on it
beyond that date, although it’s
highly unlikely. When the
houses finally do take their
votes, the budget may have
undergone a complete face-
lift, thanks to state legislators.

“They could totally rewrite”
the budget, raising or lowering

.. the allotment to Pitt, said

Kevin Evanto, assistant direc-
tor of Commonwealth
Relations. “Hopefully raising,”
he added. P

So, what are the chances that
Pitt‘ will see a significant
increase in its allotment from
the state?

“Not great,” Tuchi said.

“Although any change would .
"be signiﬁcant.”

To the same question,
Dykstra answered: “At this

stage in the game it’s too early‘

to make predictions. But in the
best of all possible worlds, it
will happen.”

ter stood as mile markers,”
said 4 Stephanie Mescall,
Greek Week Historian. “We
all cheer on our own houses,
and when you walk it’s a

. mob.”

The real winner in the
event was Family House
Charities. Although numbers
will not be made available
until after next Saturday’s
formal, early indications are

_ the charity will be a big win-

Her;

“A lot of Family House
members took place in the
walk,” said Mescall.
“They’re very interactive.”

“We had different people
from the area participate in
the run,” said Angello.

“We were pleased [since]

' we haven’t always had that

great attendance the day of
the run. I mean we’ve always
had great attendance from
the Greeks, but as far as peo-
ple signing up that day we
had more- this year.”

“We’re raising money
everyday, we’re raising tons

‘ of money for Family House,”

said Mescall.
“Last year for.Special
Olympics we raised

$102,000, and over the past
Greek Weeks we’ve raised’
over $1,000,000”

Angello indicated that
advertising in several local
publications played a key
role in the success of the
Skrun/3kwalk.

After Saturday’s festivities
the Greeks held their annual
Olympiad, known as Fun-N-
Games this year. ‘

The event combined tradi-
tional Olympiad contests,
such as the tug-of-war, with
non-traditional off-beat com-
petitions, the messiest of
these being the cake-throw-
ing contest.

Mescall said this year’s _

format ‘for the Olympiad
changed to Fun—N-Games
because of university pres-
sure-to have clean fun.

“We don’t do the chariot
races anymore, because there
were so many complaints
about us taking up Bigelow
lastlyear,” said Mescall.

Both Mescall and Angello
agreed that the new format
gives the Greeks a chance to
get caught up on school
work.

Due to the rigid structure
of one week packed with
events, many Greeks found it
di-fficult to maintain their
grades and stay healthy.

“You gotta be ready for
Dance Marathon,” said
Mescall. “Because it’s 24
hours and you’re gonna drop
if you’re tired.” ‘

The marathon, being held
at the Fitzgerald Field House
this weekend, is open to all
students this year and con-
cludes the Greek Week com-
petition.

The week following the
Dance Marathon, Greeks will
hold a formal at the Vista
Hotel in downtown

According to Quinn, the

Rhode Island is bucking the neo-Victorian backlash
which is sweeping this country and seeking to force homo-
sexualsiback into the closet. The New York Times reported
today that the Rhode Island House of Representatives has
passed a bill to provide protection to homosexuals from
discrimination in housing, employment and credit.

Similar legislation has failed to be passed in Rhode
Island four times before. Gov. Lincoln C. Almond, a
Republican bucking the trend of conservatism, however,
said he will sign it if it reaches his desk. With states
attempting to pass laws requiring the registration of.homo‘-
sexuals if they are convicted of breaking sodomy laws,
this is a positive step in the direction of protecting civil
rights of all people.

It is important not to legalize intolerance. Some say that
because homosexuals tend to be better educated and more
well—off than other minorities, they should not.get special
protection. Yet, it cannot be denied that they are a margin-

alized group and face discrimination, including violence,_

because of their sexual orientation.

Other states should seek to follow Rhode Island’s exam- V

ple, or at least not to institute laws promoting discrimina-

tion. States such as Colorado, Ohio, Maine and Florida

should repeal the laws they have on the books which pro-
mote intolerance against homosexuality.

Plciy ball!

Well, sports fans, the‘ professional baseball players are
back. The owners have agreed not to lock out the players,
but no real solution has been reached. At any time, base-
ball fans could face the loss of their favorite sport by

‘another walkout. There are no guarantees that the season

will be completed or that there will be another World
Series.

The minor leaguers and replacement players who finally
got their chance to move up are now being replaced, on
what some hope is a permanent basis, by the professionals
who earlier showed no love for the sport. The owners
should keep these players in mind, as there was some tal-

. ent, including right here in Pittsburgh, which was discov-

ered in the strike. The Pittsburgh Pirates plan to have a 25-
member team which will include some of the replacement
players. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the
owners have not yet committed to compensating the
replacements with $25,000 apiece.

The owners were forced to this decision by the courts.
They should move toward a real resolution as soon as pos-
sible. The fans should consider striking until they receive
some guarantee that they will not have the rug jerked out
from under them again. Boycotting a few games would
help let the players know for whom they really work.

Angry Democrat

I’d like to take this time to
show some problems with
things I have recently read
and explain a few things
which are often overlooked.
The nature of the U.S. econo-
my forces a minimum of
about 6 percent of the eligible
workforce into unemploy-
ment. I think this merits the
need for the government and
the people who are members

of the economy to help these.

people.
A balanced budget amend-
ment is unconstitutional. It

places the power of taxing in‘

the hands of the court, not to
mention it’s like saying that
they are incapable of doing
their job. Even though
President Clinton seems to
like the line-item veto, it
obviously puts too much
power in the hands of one
man. This clearly treads on
the balance of powers.

The voucher system was
first introduced in Virginia and
a few other states after Brown
v. Board of Education. Public
schools were closed down and
vouchers were given to whites
for entrance into private
schools created in the closed
down public school buildings.

If you are trying to under-
stand the low percentage of
voting, it has steadily
decreased since Nixon.’s
shameful exit from office. The
low voting numbers are a sure
sign that people are fed up
with the actions of most of our
elected officials.

One of the best ways to
solve many of our problems —
crime, welfare, unemployment
or whatever — is education.
Unfortunately, there continues
to be threat of cuts in funding.
It’s scary to think that the gen-
erations to come might not be
able to find proper meals or
education.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR -

Screwdriver

It appears that Marriott has
managed to screw Pitt students
one final time for the year. At
a Food Service Committee
meeting last Thursday, Food
Service Director Betsy
Sallade-Farina announced that
no matter what meal plan was
implemented next year, “There
isgoing to be a substantial
increase in pricing, regardless
of what meal plan there is.”

What is the basis for this
increase? Sallade-Farina says
it’s justified because they
spent $5 million in renova-
tions last year (where?), and
built Eddie’s "with money they
didn’t even have! Why in the
world would you build a cafe-
teria you don’t even have
funding for? Who do you
think is going to pay for it?
Oh, silly me, WE’RE sup-
posed to foot the bill. What
was I thinking?

In addition, Marriott general
manager Jim Jenkins said they
lost money on the block plan
last year partly because the
block plan was “misunder-
stood.” I understand perfectly.
I buy 100 BLOCKS. You
charge me $4.50 a BLOCK.
You only let me use $84 a
BLOCK at lunch, $3.75 per
BLOCK at the C_Store, and
don’t refund my money when I
use less than the designated

amount. Any BLOCKS that I

don’t use by the end of the
year, you keep the money
from. Did I forget anything
Mr. Jenkins? I think you’d bet-
ter examine those books again.
You ought to be "making
money, especially since you
charge $4 a pound for salad at
Eddie’s.

If Marriott can’t manage its

ﬁnances and provide nutritious.

food at a reasonable price
without giving us the raw end
of the deal, maybe Pitt needs
to find someone else to feed
us. As for me, I’ll be cooking
for myself next year at half the
cost I pay now.

Keep the contract

In response to the protest
to the “Contract with
America” I am writing in
support of the group of
intellectually elevated and
insightful individuals who
so vibrantly protested the
Republican-led “Contract
with America.” We owe a
hardy “right on!” to those
who cannot stand a
Congress who is fast acting
and undiluted; one that isn’t

afraid to take a solid stand -

on an issue instead of walk-
ing the fence or running for
cover, or a Congress that is
willing to fight for those
who are victims of legal
abuse and attorney molesta-
tion. Let’s “vote out” those
representatives who are
attempting to shrink govern-
ment spending to a level that
actually equals what they
haveto spend in the first
place. Let’s cut the speeches
short of those who take the
radical view that crime is to
be paired with punishment
and not ‘costly rehabilitation
so that criminals may
acknowledge that what they
are about to do again may be
slightly more immoral than
what they had hoped for
before. Lastly, let’s round up
those who have the courage
and dedication to the institu-
tion to question whether
social policies have over-
stepped their original intent
and usefulness. No, let’s
keep those policies and add
on another to counteract the
first. What those most polit-
ically learned individuals
have done is rally the sup-

5 port for the stagnant status

quo that America voted to
change in the first place.
Maybe what we should real-
ly commend them for is

Columnist Vﬁfything YOU
Benjamin ~ are about to
Jackson read 1S true. No

names have been
changed because there are no inno-
cents. This story, however, begins
at the end, and not at the beginning.
The story is one about a city that
tries to keep its secrets
Washington D.C.:—- and people
who didn’t try to find them out -
the college media. Thursday, March
23, was College Media Day at the
White House. Editors of college
newspapers from all over the coun-

try, including Alaska and Hawaii, ,
‘converged at the White House to

meet with Cabinet members, admin-
istration officials and the president
himself. At the outset, the theme
underlying this whole event was
summed up nicely in the president’s
speech: “This is  a fascinating
time to be in our nation’s capital.
We are having a great debate about
how we can best assure the
American Dream for your genera-
tion and for your children well into
the next century. The choices we
make here will have a profound
effect on all of your lives.”

Most of these people were either
editors in chief or news editors with
photographers. As far as I know,
there was only one paper with the
courage, or lack of foresight, to
send their opinions editor. Your
own Pitt News sent its opinions edi-
tor to mix and mingle inside the
beltway. When the other conference
participants asked what I did, I told

_ them that I was the opinions editor

and that I made no pretensions
about objective journalism or get-
ting the facts, and I make none now.
The unfortunate thing is that many
of them did. Itseemed no one was
interested in getting a visceral feel
for the environment in which the

 

/

decisions were being made. They
tended to be more interested in their
narrow slice of the pie. So much so,
one editor was asking Cabinet
members about his school’s policy
on releasing statistics on alcohol
policy violations in the dorms. The
national perspective was lacking
but parochialism prevailed.

The Cabinet members were going
to give us what we asked for, at
least we could hope, but investiga-
tive journalism did notabound.
Dick Riley, secretary of education,
even shot us the tired, Jefferson
quote: “If I were asked to choose
between government without news-
papers or newspapers without gov-
ernment, I should not hesitate a
moment to choose the latter.” He
left out the most important part of
the quote: “But I should mean that
every man get those newspapers
and be capable of reading them.”
No one called him on this, probably
because they didn’t know them-

..selves, but they ought to have

known’. Instead, those participants
who were more conservative tried
to look for holes and directly attack
what the speakers were saying.

The speakers were brief so that
questions could be asked, but they
were often surprised by the depth of
a student’s knowledge when they
had the opportunity to address a
topic in which they were interested.
This shows there is some hope, but
the surprise of the membersof the
Cabinet did not bode well.

The final event in most people’s
minds was the forum with the presi-
dent. Thereris something which is a
bit awe inspiring when you realize
that you are in the East Room of the
White House where so many press
conferences have been held and that
you are in the presence of the presi-
dent. I’m a populist and not inter-

there is something special about the
leader of the country.
He spoke and took questions,

‘though some were planted. The

questions here varied, but were still
somewhat focused narrowly on stu-
dent concerns, but if you could say
anything to the president, or ask
him any question, what would it be?

Well, afterward, there was a receiv- ‘

ing line in which we got to shake
the president’s hand and speak
briefly with him. Since I only had

about 30 seconds, I told him the,

following joke: Two Cannibals were
eating a clown. One cannibal says
to the other: “Does this taste funny

world, but what was I going to say
“Bill, I’m a Republican, but I pray
for you anyway.” My reasoning
behind the joke was, since it was a
receiving line, not a conference,-
there wasn’t much time to say any-
thing of real substance.

At the end of the day, where it
was most likely to be missed
because it was after meeting the
president, there was a panel discus-
sion about the media itself. The
panel was composed of, from left to
right, George Stephanopoulos,
Kathryn Higgins and Mark Gearan.
It "was Stephanopoulos who made a

remark which I discounted at the’

time, but having given it some
thought, I now give it more cre-
dence.

He said that newspapers and the
media should discard their claims
of objectivity and report the news
from a particular perspective. We

were openly partisan, according to

that, I thought it was outlandish,
but then I recalled the conversations
I had heard going on around me and

the question and answer periods

throughout the day.
Oftentimes, the press prints an

article with a text which tries to

appear objective, but has a subtext
of bias. Or, editorials are masked as
analysis and printed as though they
were the truth. Objectivity is a use-
ful goal, but the media must
remember that people are counting
on them for information and treat
this information as fact. They
should not hide an opinion among
news in order to promote a view-
point. Since this is an increasing

trend in the media, perhaps it would

be better simply to put the biases
out in the open and leave facts to
the wire services.

College media, like the real
media, lacks perspective, suffers
under its editorship and lacks the
appropriate information. Not>exam-
ining things in a critical way is one
of the chief faults of our generation.
Too often, things are simply written

off out of cynicism and not truly .

examined.

As we move through the last
decade of the most destructive cen-
tury in world history, we as mem-
bers of the mediagand as students,
must attempt to maintain a holistic
perspective on where we are and
where we’re going. It is true that
we are at a pivotal point in history,
and unless we try to gain a real
understanding for what is happen-
ing and face the issues with that
understanding, we will drown in the
rising tide of time.

Last Saturday at the National
Independent Championships held at
Western Michigan, two Panther gymnasts
qualified for post-season action.

Keith Youndt tied a school record on
the parallel bars with a 9.75 and qualified
to attend next Saturday’s NCAA East
Regional, which will be held at Penn
State. Teammate Karl Chan will be join-
ing him after a 9.8 on the high bar.

“At the end it was tremendous, we did
so well,” said coach Frank D’Amico.
“And qualifying guys for NCAAs was a
oy.”

J The Panthers closed out their regular
season dropping their final two matches.
Western Michigan needed every bit of its
new school record 224.85 to edge out the
University of Illinois at Chicago which
tallied 224.60. Pitt was third with 219.75,
and the Panthers finished the season with
a final record of 19-10.

The preliminary round in the afternoon I

went well for the Panthers, as six gym-
nasts qualified for the finals later that
evening.

Jason Lannie and Youndt set the pace
on the still rings, both scoring 9.55 early
in the competition. Their scores were
enough for them to finish’ tied for first
and to notch berths in the finals.

Youndt also made the finals with a 9.55
on pommel-horse and a 9.60 on parallel
bars.

“Judges weren’t afraid to give out good
scores, which was nice,” D’Amico said.
“The scoring was good. We had quite a
few major breaks as a team in the after-
noon. Otherwise, it would’ve been real
close.” _

Lannie perhaps had the toughest day of
all. His second place 55.55 in the prelim-
inary all-around competition qualified
him for action later in the evening. With
only a short break, he was able to come
back and score a 55.7, often with only
two minutes to rest between events.

because I did so well in prelims,” Lannie

said. “But I’m killing — especially after
the seven-hour van trip.”

Other Panthers making it to the finals
were Andy Anderson and , Eric
Censoprano on floor with 9.3 and 9.2
respectively. Chris Sweeten qualified for
the pommel horse (9.25) and high bar
(9.45), and Karl Chan tied for second in
the prelims on high bar with a 9.65.

In the finals, the Pitt gymnasts didn’t
let down. Youndt (9.4), Lannie (9.3) and
Sweeten (8.85) finished third, fourth -and
sixth respectively on pommel horse.

Lannie was sixth on floor, behind
UIC’s Shannon Welker, who was first

with 9.75.

On rings, Youndt improved on his pre-
vious score and took top honors, finish-
ing with 9.75. Welker was next with 9.6,
and Lannie was third with 9.4.

Lannie was fifth on parallel bars with a’

9.45, which followed Youndt’s second-

place finish. He finished behind UIC’s _

Carey Reddick, who posted a 9.8.

Finally, on high bar, Sweeten and
Lannie scored 9.25 for sixth place behind
Chan’s second-place score. WMU’s
Brian Franson was first with 9.825.

“If you did well, you were rewarded
well,” said Lannie about the judging. “It
got a couple of guys into regionals too.”

_Sﬂff Writer

This past weekend, the men’s ten-
nis team trounced the Robert Morris
College Colonials 7-0. Then the
Panthers got a look at two Big East
rivals, Villanova and Georgetown,
and walked away with two black
eyes. The funny thing is that the
losses were probably more important
than the win for Pitt.

“[Those matches] give us an idea
of what’s going to happen at the Big
East Championship (April 21-23 at

V Miami),” coach George Dieffenbach-

said. Pitt is expected to be seeded
eighth among nine teams at the
championship. Villanova and
Georgetown will probably be seeded
fifth and sixth respectively.

Despite the losses, the future of
the men’s tennis team against the
Big East isn’t necessarily gloomy.
In fact, said Dieffenbach, those
matches were kind of encouraging,
odd as it may sound. “With a couple
of breaks and a better team
performance, we would have
awon those matches,” Dieffenbach
said.

The matches against Villanova and
Georgetown were close contests,
indeed.

On Sunday, the Georgetown Hoyas
met the Panthers (8-9) at a neutral
site, Bloomsburg in central
Pennsylvania, and edged them 4-3.
Dieffenbach, who is in the middle of
year 20 as Pitt’s varsity tennis coach,
called it the “best showing” that a
Pitt tennis team has ever had against

In singles, the Panthers won three
and .lost._thre,e_to_ the Hoyas. Brad
Wade, the team’s No. 2 seed, along
with No. 5 Matt Mills and No. 6

Stephen Rosenthal (who have been
struggling a bit) notched victories.
Rosenthal simply overpowered
Georgetown’s Jeff Breay, winning 6-
2, 6-0.

‘However, the Panthers were swept
in doubles competition. Even Pitt’s
team‘ of Braden Doherty, No. 1 seed,
and Wade suffered a loss (9-8).

The day before, the Panthers tan-
gled with the hosting Villanova
Wildcats and lost 5-2. The meet
started well for the Panthers;

.Doherty and Wade turned in an

8-6 doubles victory as did Christian
Frenza and Mike “Thor” Sullivan.
Even though the team of Mills
and Rosenthal lost, it was inconse-
quential. By taking
three double matches, the Panthers
earned a point (as per the rules of
tennis).

In singles play, the Wildcats took‘
their revenge. For Pitt; only Doherty
won his match (6-2, 6-3). The win
was his 16th of the year, the club
lead. Of the other Panthers, Frenza
came the closest to a win, losing 7-5,
7-6. . ,

On Friday, the Panthers merciless-
ly bullied the visiting Robert Morris
Colonials, winning ever match that
was played_— six singles and three
doubles. Doherty and Wade checked
in with an 8-6 win, Frenza and
Sullivan won 8-4 and Mills and
Rosenthal blasted their opponents 8-
3.

In singles, only Wade and
Rosenthal showed any signs of fal-
tering, but they still pulled out victo-
ries. Wade won 7-6, 6-4 and
Rosenthal beat his opponent 6-4, 7-5.
It was Rosentha1’s first victory this
year. _ _  _

Pinestof the Four

By Matt Groff

_ Senior Staff Writer

Twenty years and six
head coaches since their
last NCAA National
Championship, the UCLA
Bruins once again brought
home the top prize in col-
lege basketball last night
on the shoulders of NCAA
Player of the Year Ed
O’Bannon.

O’Bannon, a senior,
turned in a 30 point, 16
rebound performance in
a game which critics
did not expect the Bruins
to win without the services
of injured guard Tyus
Edney. '

However, UCLA’s quick
and crisp passing was too
much for the .Arkansas

pressure defense in the sec-
ond half.

~“We stayed positive,”
O’Bannon told CBS after
the game, “and put every-
thing in God’s hands.” A

After taking a time-
out with 12 minutes
left, the Razorbacks kept
themselves in the game
by capitalizing on the mis-
takes of the weary Bruins,
but a lack of consistent
rebounding and missed
free throws limited their
productivity. In their
last run, the Razorbacks cut
the Bruin lead to three
points with five minutes
left.

The momentum quickly
dispersed when Arkansas
committed three fouls in
the next minute, sending

The Pitt News, Tuesday, April 4, 1995

The outlook was not
so good for the Bruins
three minutes into the
game, however,- when
UCLA head coach Jim
Harrick -could see that
Edney was too injured to
play effectively against
Arkansas.

Edney, UCLA’s assist

' leader and their second

leading scorer, was treated
for a sprained wrist
after Saturday’s
but was expected to
play most of the game last
night.

“I started him but knew
he couldn’t play for lOng,”
Harrick told CBS after
commenting on Edney’s
problems during pregame
warmups.

Edney was named the

game-

lO'Bannon leads UCLA Bruins to their 1 lth National Championship

West Regional Most
Valuable Player and
O’Bannon called him the
team’s MVP just for getting
them to the championship
game. Without a healthy
Edney, who was critical in
each of the Bruins"five
previous tourney wins, the
chaos in the UCLA offense

was evident early in the

game.

Down 5-3, Arkansas
went on a lO-po.int run
and seemed to be beating
the Bruins at their
own game. However, slop-
py passing became an
early antagonist to the
Razorback attack and
allowed UCLA to pull
even. By halftime, the lead
was see—sawing back

is exactly what they did.

Davis played a very expe-
rienced player in Dillon and
won in straight sets (6-4, 6-
2).

Kalesnik won her first set
in a close tiebreaker (7-6).
She dropped the second set,
4-6, but came out and
changed the pace in the
third defeating Chris Grasso
using strong ground strokes
<6-2).    

“She played a smart
match,” said head coach
George Dieffenbach.

Kristin Siegel won her
first set easily, 6-2. She
became tentative in the sec-
ond set and lost, 5-7. She
then regrouped to win with a
solid 6-3 third set.

“She won by being very
determined, very persistent
and also very consistent,”
said Dieffenbach.

“George came over and
calmed me down and

gave me some advice,”

said Siegel. “I luckily pulled
out the win in the third
set.”

Baker lost to Barnes (6-0,
6-2) and Keister lost to Meg
Daniels (7-5; 6-2).

“If you look at Keister’s
match she had a close first
set and a fairly close second
set,” said Dieffenbach. “She
really fought until the bitter
end.”

Zielinski also had a close
match losing in three sets to
Tiff Geiser (7-5, 6-2, 6-2).

“The team has been

steadily improving all year.

ter and better,” said
Dieffenbach. “It seems
like we’re moving in
the right direction and
peaking for the end of the
season and the Big East
Championship.”

teams had at more
than 10 turnovers in
the half.

.For Arkansas,
defending national
champions who came
back from halftime
deficits in all five of
their previous victo-
ries in this year’s
tournament, there
would be no repeat
thanks to the stepped
up play by the
O’Bannons as well as
freshman sensation
Tobey Bailey.

“We sucked it up
and played hard,”
Harrick said.

“We ran everything
we wanted to and
guarded the [three-
point shot].”

In the semis, BU rolled past
the University of Minnesota,
7-3. However, Maine’s ticket
to the final was not as easy.
In one of the best games of
the tournament, Maine edged
the Michigan Wolverines, 4-3
in triple overtime.

The games were great,
even if you don’t know the
difference between a slap
shot or a shot of firewater
(my sister), and the best thing
about the tournament was
after the championship game,
the BU players lined up and
shook hands, one by one,
with every player from
Maine.

It’s a tradition in college
hockey, some people‘
might call it sportsmanship.
Just another reason to give
hockey a second look next
yean.
