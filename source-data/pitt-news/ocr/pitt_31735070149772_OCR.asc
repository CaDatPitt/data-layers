Kevin Booth is ﬁghting a war,
and he’s doing it with a camera.

Booth, the director of several
documentaries, met with ‘Pitt
students Wednesday afternoon
to discuss the _ legalization of
marijuana.

“This is not about partying
or drugs,” Booth, 50, said of le-
galization advocacy efforts. “It’s
about whether you think . the
governmenthas the right to tell
people what they can and can’t
do with their own bodies.”

Pitt NORML, a campus orga-
nization that advocates the' le-
galization .of marijuana, hosted
the two-hour event in the O’Hara
Student Center Ballroom. Pitt’s
Student Government Board ap-
proved the student‘group’s re-
quest of $3,650 to bring the

Much of the event centered

_ on Booth’s upcoming ﬁlm, a se-

quel to his‘ 2009 documentary.
In a continuation of themes ex-

plored in “American Drug War: '

The ‘Last White Hope,” “Ameri-
can Drug War II: Fight for Your

The clips Booth showed to
the small and supportive audi-
ence of 10 people focused on the
negative effects of legal phar-
maceutical drugs, the removal
of medical marijuana dispensa-
ries in California and the medi-
cal beneﬁts of marijuana.

Booth discussed the growth
of marijuana. for cannabidiol
(CBD), a molecule in the drug
that research has shown can in-
hibit cancer-cell growth.

Booth said the U.S. govern-
ment‘ patented CBDs in 2003
but that research in the ﬁeld of

“My wife referred -to it as my

He described the process as

it’s like, ‘Damn.”’

“You guys are going to be the
leaders of tomorrow. You’re the
next wave,” he said.

Booth’s visit marked one of

‘Pitt NORML’s ﬁrst organiﬁad ‘

events since its inception as a
SORC student group in 2009. ’ —

“[In past years] we were try-H

ing to ﬁnd our footing. Now we
have a good core group of people
who actually put in the time to
effect change,” said NORML vice

' president Michael Arkwright.

. Arkwright said that about

15 students regularly attend » '
NORML’s weekly Monday meet— _

ings in the Cathedral of Learn-

. ing, where they discuss current

events related to marijuana‘ le-
galization. » .
“We’re not only working to

‘ change policies in our state, but

to change perceptions about

marijuana

campuses to promote activism
for the legalization of marijua-
na.

marijuana,” NORML president
Julia Johnson said._“We’re doing
that with one—on—one conversa-
tions.”

Pitt NORML works on cam-

pus to educate students about t

the efforts to legalize marijuana,

often tabling in Litchﬁeld Tow- ’

ers Lobby. ‘-

“Whenever someone comes
-up to us at Towers Lobby and
sees the pot leaf, ‘they ask us
what we do. We really don’t

want people to treat us as the‘

. -really are I’ about education. If

you want a stoners’"'club, don’t
come to us. Wewant to effect

“This is not about partying

Thackeray Hall received the
day’s first threat Wednesday

morning. Pitt sent out an Emer--

gency Notiﬁcation System alert
around 10:15 a.m. notifying
people of the bomb threat and
advising them to evacuate the
building. The threat was cleared
about 45 minutes later.

Nearly six and a half hours
afterward, another ENS alert
notified the campus of three
‘more threats at the -Cathedral of
Learning, Posvar Hall and Litch-
ﬁeld Tower C. The buildings were
evacuated, and the threats were
all cleared by 7:30 p.m.

‘An _ENS alert said that Ca-
thedral would reopen at 6 a.m.
today. ' .

Two hours after the three
threats were cleared, Pitt sent out
another ENS alert at 9:20 p.m.

for three morebombthreats --
this time at Victoria Hall, Frick
Fine Arts and the Music Building.
The threatened buildings were
evacuated, although the Lothrop
Hall dormitory, which is attached
to Victoria Hall, was not evacu-

ated.

Around 11:50 p.m., an ENS
alert said that the three build-

ings had been cleared and normal S

operations would be resumed at
that time'. ‘ ,
Pitt spokesman Robert Hill
said in an email that the threat
at Thackeray Hall was written on

Delaney said that the threats
for the Cathedral of Learning,

C came from emails sent to Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette reporters.

Delaney also commented on
the “person of interest” whom
Hill said the University had pre-
viously identiﬁed in mid-March
after the ﬁrst four threats.

“We handed over their infor-‘

mation to the FBI,” he said.
Delaney also said that he did

different number of agencies that
are involved. He did say the Uni-

versity would attempt to calculate -
, the total cost at a later date.

“Right now, we’re just focused
on responding to the threats,”
he said. ' _

Pitt spokesman John Fedele
said in an email that the direct
costs associated with each in-
cident involve multiple factors,
including the secure evacuation
of each building and subsequent

investigations by Pitt police
and partners at the local, state,
county and federal levels.
Indirect costs of the threats
include interference with class
schedules and ‘the disruption

' of staff and faculty work days,

Fedele said. .
Pitt juniorjonathan Andrews

‘ said he was well aware‘ of what

Wednesday’s. Cathedral of Learn-
ing bomb threat cost him ——
“about 80 bucks.”

Andrews said that he lost two
hours of work to attend his night
class, plus the costs of parking,

He also cited other negative
effects of the ongoing threats,
including the monetary loss to
Pitt and the way the threats have

” nity. »

“It’s sad,” he said.

Shortly before the threats to
Posvar, Tower C and the Cathe-
dral, Shawn Brooks, the associate
deanof students and director of
Residence Life, sent out an email

‘to all residence hall students that

detailed the hours counselors

Resident Assistants in Tow-
ers have begun advising their
residents to pack backpacks
with supplies in the event that
another bomb threat occurs in
the middle of the night, as did
the one that emptied Towers at 4

a.m. on Tuesday morning. .

Freshman Kaylyn Farneth,
a resident of Tower A, said her
RA told residents to pack kits to

Pitt CWO holds panel
on genderstereotypmg

By Mahita Gajanan
Staff Writer

RaShall Brackney headed both the'SWAT
team and police force at the G-20 summit
in 2009.

But Brackney said co—workers advised
her to “be heard but not seen” so the rest
of the police in the team would take her se-
riously.

“That made me look less competent,
even though I was the one in charge of the
SWAT team,” Brackney said to an audience
of 47 students Wednesday night in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union. A

Brackney spoke at Pitt’s Campus Wom-
en’s Organization’s panel discussion with
three other professional women from dif-
ferent fields. The panelists primarily spoke
about the inﬂuence of media on gender
stereotypes and the way such stereotypes
make their way into the workplace.

Sherdina Harper, Pitt’s Cross Cultural
and Leadership Development program-
ming coordinator, moderated the event.

“We just give our own power away,”
Brackney sa°id, urging the largely female
audience not to run from challenges and
to stick to convictions even in the face of

 

opponents.

The two—day event also included a ﬁlm
screening on Tuesday. More than 40 stu-
dents gathered in the William Pitt Union

. to watch the 2011 documentary “Miss Rep-

resentation,” which follows the way media
shapes gender roles in society, politics and
violence. '

CWO President Gina Roussos orga-
nized the event through the Young People
For Fellowship program, run through the
American Way Foundation.

Questions from the audience on
Wednesday night varied from whether the
women faced gender stereotyping within
their own families to how a person can deal
with the way the media portrays women
and what stigmas working-class mothers
face.

Jennifer Cairns, a partner at McGuire-
Woods, a Pittsburgh-based law ﬁrm, said
men assume working mothers cannot han-
dle the pressures of working while raising

a child. She also said other women turn

against working women, thinking that
they are not spending enough time either
in the home or the workplace.

“We get it from both sides,” Cairns
said.

All four panelists emphasized that

Tyler Nalbach faced a similar situation
when his organic chemistry. exam in the
Chevron Science Center was postponed
on March 28 after the building received a
bomb threat. ' ,

“Having to cancel the OChem test was
frustrating because it was rescheduled

the same day as my physics exam, which

inhibited my ability to do my best, since
I was now dividing my study time among
two tests,” the sophomore said.

Nalbach’s organic chemistry professor,
Dennis Curran, was out of town when an
exam scheduled for his students was inter-
rupted by a Chevron bomb threat.

He said his test proctor made the deci-

sion to wait to hand out the exam during _V
the ﬁrst few minutes of class in case there '

was an evacuation. That way the students

didn’t see the exam, and it was held during .

the next class.

said. '

f To prevent exam cancellation, psychol-

ogy professor Melanie Shoup-Knox made

- alternative room plans.

On March 14, Shoup-Knox said she did
not know if the threat to the Cathedral of
Learning would be cleared by the time of

the class’s scheduled exam, so she told stu— '

dents to make sure to keep their eyes on
their inboxes for a new room assignment.

“These students deserve to have the

Knox said.

‘many have said they are not sure what de-

cisions they will make in the event that Pitt
receives bomb threats during ﬁnals week.
Pitt spokesman Robert Hill did not re-
spond to multiple requests for comment
on whether the University has a plan in
case a threat happens during ﬁnals week.
Shoup-Knox said that she would work
with her department to reschedule any
evacuated ﬁnal exams as soon as possible;
“If this should happen, it would most
certainly affect students negatively,” she
said. “It would be a shame if individuals
would be selﬁsh enough to disrupt the edu-
cation of so many students.”

to occur, but that different options are

He said some alternatives would be to
administer his ﬁnal after 8 p.m. when most
other_classes are dismissed or to give the
test the same day and time the following
week for students who can stay.

If students can’t stay the extra week,
he said one plan would be to give them an
“incomplete” grade and have them take a
new test the ﬁrst day of class the following
semester.

“We can always rewrite the exam, re-
schedule, etc., but many students have al-
ready bought air tickets and simply cannot
stay in town to retake it the following week
at the same time "of class,” Barroso said. “I
hope it won’t happen, but if it does, we may
be in a very complicated situation.” I

Harvard or Princeton requires
exceptional intelligence. But
what if Ivy League schools al-

lowed chance to dictate who A
’ they accepted and rejected?

In a Chronicle of Higher
Education op-ed this Sunday,
Dalton Conley, the dean of so-

_ cial sciences at New York Uni-

versity, proposed ‘a radical new
approach to college admissions:
Rather than evaluating applica-
tions _holistically, administra-
tors should establish a few pre-
requisites —— a top-10-percent
class ranking, for instance —
that all prospective students
must meet. Once they’ve elimi-
nated the ineligible candidates,
they can randomize their re-
maining decisions.

This “lottery” arrangement

—— which Conley believes would
reduce students’ anxieties
about, say, SAT scores —-\ isn’t
without its redeeming qualities.
For one thing, it would prevent
legacy students from gaining
an upper hand. For another,
it would immediately render
preferential treatment based on
race and sex a non—issue. l
Nevertheless, we think
implementing such a system
would be disastrous. Far from
diminishing the stress students
might feel about their GPAS,
test scores and other numeric
measures of aptitude, a simplis-
tic eligibility benchmark would
eliminate the opportunity for
them to distinguish themselves
in other areas. If, for instance,
Harvard made a 2300 SAT score
its minimum entry require-
ment, everyone with Ivy League

aspirations would devote their V

Schools shouldn't implement
‘lottenfadmissions system  

A Most people think getting into

entire. high‘ school ‘lives to
achieving that score, to the ex-
clusion of extracurriculars.
Furthermore, a lottery sys-
tem would by‘no means level
the socioeconomicplayingﬁeld.
Multiple studies have shown

that rich students, who have a -

wider variety of academic re-
sources at’ their " disposal, are

‘more likely to score higher on ,
V the SATs than their similarly in-

telligent, lower-income peers.
r .Last but not least, Conley is
naive to assume that students

_A don’t care which college they".

attend, so long as it affords
them a certain future income.
Many members of our commu-
nity, for instance,’ selected Pitt
over Penn State because they
preferred an urban campus,

despite the slight advantage the I

latter holds in alumni lifetime
earnings, according to, Pay-
Scale.com. If both institutions
admitted people via a lottery,
high schoolers might not have
the opportunity to choose be-
tween one or the other based on
important factors like location
and size. V

We’ll acknowledge that ad——

missions criteria, especially
for elite universities, are often
arbitrary and inane. -But a lot-
tery system would create more
problems than it would elimi-
nate. Human judgment might
be imperfect, but we’d much
prefer to have trained adminis-
trators rather than a computer
algorithm evaluating students’
applications. If you devote your
entire high school career to im-
proving your chances of attend-
ing an elite school, you deserve
some personal attention.

EDITORIAL S A THE STAMATTACK

TSA should rethink its approach
  to national security

By Nick Starnatakis
Columnist

I. have a solution to the bomb threat problem: full-
body pat-downs in front of every bathroom’.

Since many of the notices seem to be coming
via black-marker scribbles on bathroom stalls, ac-

cording to the Pittsburgh Post- Gazette, a full—body.
pat—down will make all of us feel safer. Profession— -

als at every door will feel us up as we enter a rest-
room, and, when they ﬁnd a black marker, they’ll
putit in a special box and the campus will besafe
again. _ ‘

A few other measures would also have to be
taken. Students will need to remove their shoes
(somebody might use them to slip in a marker),
and they’ll need to give up anything that might

serve the same function as a marker. Just comply,

and ﬂy up those elevators.

Wait, -you have a problem with this because it’s
hard to ﬁnd a marker through a pat—down? You’re
claiming that more than 70 percent of markers
would still make it through anyway? To you nay-
sayers, I say: Shame on you. Even if this system
is only 30 percent effective, we can all agree it’s
still a useful procedure: It would have reduced the

number of threats in the past months from x to y. A »

small beneﬁt, but a legitimate one nonetheless.

Wait, you say you have a problem with this be-
cause it might be expensive? You’re claiming that a
series of bomb threats doesn’t justify a $2.4 billion
pat—down program? Shame on you again. If you‘
consider yourself a real Pitt student, you should
cherish the incremental beneﬁts that might theo-
retically result from aggressive pat-downs.

Wait, you say that this won’t even address the
issue at hand? You’re claiming that potential bomb
threateners will just learn how to smuggle in mark-
ers, or that people will simply phone in threats
or write them on chalkboards rather than stalls‘?
Once more, I say shame on you, because you are
once again missing the point. We will simply go
wherever they go, creating security checkpoints
at all doors and parking garages until you feel 100
percent safe.

Then we’ll ﬁnally be out of harm’s way. It might
take 40 minutes to enter a University building, but
at least we’ll know that we might possibly be a bit
safer.

And if you don’t like my idea, I will simply have
to join the Transportation Security Administra-
tion.

The TSA, the post—9/11 governmental orga-
nization tasked with keeping our skies safe, ac-
tually performs about as well in real life as this
hypothetical bathroom security, with 70 percent
of weapons escaping detection at some major air-
ports, according to ABC News, and an estimated
$2.5 billion slated to fund full—body X-raypscanners
that can’t detect certain explosives and weapons.
If there is an actual money pit within the federal

MCT Campus 1

government, the TSA is it.

Yet the public doesn’t seem to care. Support
for the scanners, which blogger Jonathan Corbett
demonstrated can’t even detect metals in certain

situations, is at 81 percent, according to a CBS .
News poll. And while the TSA’s overall 38 percent ‘
approval rating in a Reason-Rupe poll might seem .

low, it still exceeds Congress’s and is comparable
to the president’s. Funding-wise, the TSA is a gov-
ernmental prom queen, enjoying rare bipartisan
support even amid the bitterest funding ﬁghts.
The organization’s popularity is confusing — if
any other agency yielded the same high costs and

low beneﬁts, it would be met with widespread pro-

test. Imagine if the Pitt police actuallyrdecided that
pat-downs at every door were a good idea. It’s hard
to imagine a world where 81 percent of students

would ﬁnd this OK. Even discounting privacy

concerns, we would all consider these measures

Summer 2012: The college students guide

By Sarah Reagle
Columnist

We’re in the ﬁnal few weeks be-
fore the semester ends, so there’s
really only one thing weighing on
people’s minds: how to spend the
summer. Most of you probably
have jobs, classes or internships
lined up that will make the sea-
son less fun than your inner-tub-
ing and ice—cream-truck-chasing
days. But don’t let this get you
down. You can still have a pretty
decent summer even with your
semi—adult responsibilities.

Here are_ a few, suggestions

to make yourupcoming months‘

inner-tubing,

ice-cream-truck-
chasing great: '

Prepare for bikini season

One of the most dreadedlas-y

pects of summer for a lot of wom-
en — and men, for that matter a
is the thought of spending-time
in public wearing a bathing suit.
The besgway to combatthis fear
is to remain conﬁdent. If you like
the way you look, it’ll show. Feel
good; look good.

Before you run out to buy a
new bathing suit, remind your-
self that the vast majority of peo-

ple don’t look amazing wearing’

swimsuits. Try to take a friend
shopping with you who’s honest

and whom you won’tget mad at

for truth—telling. If he or she can’t
tell you that you have a saggy el-
ephant butt in those bottoms,
who can‘? Find a suit that you re-
ally like and that ﬁts you well, and
rock it. P .

If 'you’ve spent the , entire
winter coopedl up inside, now
is the time to start ‘exercising
again. As a sage quote on Pinter-
est.com notes, “Losing weight
makes you look good in clothes;
exercise makes you look good
naked.” Since bathing suits are
a step away from being naked,
you should probably head to the
gym. There’s no reason not to
exercise. You likely have free ac-
cess to machinery on campus, it’s
beautiful outside, and even Netf—
lix has mediocre workout videos.
You don’t have to leave the house
if you don’t want to. If you start
rightnow, you’ll notice.a change

. in yourself bygthe time the semes-

ter ends.

If you want to lo_se some weight
quickly and in a healthy way, pay
attention to what you’re drinking
every weekend. Most of your fa-
vorite beers are at least 150 calo-

, ries, and shots are around 100
calories each — without mixers.

Consider cutting a couple unnec-
essary beers or shots from your
weekends, and the saved calories
quickly add  ’

Planning vacations

Vacations are arguably the

most fun part of summer. You get
to go somewhere out of the norm,
pretend that you won’t gain
weight from eating ice cream dai-
ly and shirk all real-life responsi-
bilities. It’s great. But if you don’t
have a wealthy benefactor, a fam-
ily beach house or friends with a
family beach house, it could be
difficult to plan a vacation at all.
If you want to rent’ a beach
house for cheap, book it for the
offseason. The semester ends by
May, so that entire month is fair
game and generally included in
offseason pricing. Costs are ex-

ponentially cheaper for any va-

cation you book during that time
period, and beachhouses are no
exception. The ocean might be a
little colder, but it’ll still be warm
and beautiful outside.

If at all possible, try to con-
tact the owner of a vacation
house directly rather than going
through a rental company. I’ve
found that the best — and only
slightly sketchy —-way to do this
is through “vacation rentals” on
Craigslist. Just be extra careful
that you’re not being scammed.

As summer draws nearer, people“

get desperate and would rather
give you a discounted week than
rent to no one at all. Be willing
to ask property owners if they’ll
rent to you for prices cheaper
than they’re advertising —— the
worst that can happen is they say
no. If you go this_route, it also
helps to have more people vaca-

tioning with you to split costs, so
make some friends.

Takeamini-vacation ‘
/

Sometimes even discounted
rates are too much money, or
sometimes you can’t spend an
entire week on vacation. If you
really can’t afford to go on a big

. vacation, plan a mini—vacation.

There are plenty of places worth
visiting thatare close enough to
Pittsburgh that you can spend a
weekend or even take a day trip
there. Ohiopyle and the Laurel
Highlands are good choices for
the adventure-seeker and camp-
ing enthusiast. You could even
take a drive up to Moraine ‘State
Park, rent a kayak for a few hours
and enjoy a picnic. It doesn’t take
a lot of time or money to escape
real life for a little bit._]ust be cre-
ative, and learn to love the out-
doors.

Another option is to visit a
theme park. Kennywood is prac-
tically within walking distance,
and there are other parks close

- enough to drive to. Cedar Point

— literally the Best Amusement
Park in the World, according to .
magazine Amusement Today —
is a three-hour drive from Pitts-
burgh. Wake up early and go for
a day. Book a hotel for a night if
you want to go roller—coaster cra-
zy. Just remember to wear shorts
that dry quickly for when you
pee your pants on the Top Thrill

Dragster. Really.

If you want to shell out a little
more money for a mini-vacation,
go on a weekend trip to Orlando
to visit Universal Studios. Sure,
Universal got a bad rap when you
were a kid; Disney was right next

, to it and so much cooler. Not only

is Universal ridiculously cheap
compared to Disney, but here are
six words that should make you
want to go more than any amount
of princesses or dwarves: The
Wizarding World of Harry Pot-
ter. It’s incredible. You can spend
your days sipping butterbeer and
talking in a British accent. Book a
package to save money, and make
sure to get a hotel that offers free
shuttle service and a complimen-
tary-breakfast. '

My last essential tip: Once
you’re at a theme park, don’t be
afraid to whip out that fanny
pack. It holds certain crucial
items, and you don’t have to take
it off to go on most rides. Plus, it’s
obviously super cool.

Now that you’re armed with _

knowledge, power through these
last few weeks of classes with the
thought that you’re in for a good
summer. And when you’re pro-
crastinating writing a -paper or
studying for a test, make sure to
book those vacation homes. I

wasteful. Of course, groundless
bomb threats and a major terror-

‘ ist attack are two entirely differ-

ent crimes — TSA was created,

after 9/11, and the enormity of
that tragedy probably accounts
for the extensiveness of their cur-
rent security measures.
Nevertheless, the University
has developed a policy that the

federal government should ad- A

here to. Based on news reports,
the administration and local law
enforcement seem to be holding

an exhaustive investigation. And

when a threat is discovered,- the
police respond quickly and ef-

ﬁciently, conducting thorough‘

searches while allowing the

community to act appropriately
— the equivalent of the police’s
response to the thwarted under-
wear and Times Square bombings
of 2009 and 2010, respectively.
What the Pitt police do not do
is try to catch those responsible
right before a threat occurs. They

realize this strategy is ineffective,
both ﬁnancially and practically.
The federal government and the
TSA, sadly, do not seem to realize
this. I

*Avoid had documentaries, take this advice and be entertained

etteaeeeseé

By Pat McAteer
Staff Writer

No one deserves to get half way through a
documentary only to discover that it’s aw-
ful. To help viewers avoid something so
traumatic, I’ve taken the liberty of writing
a list of 10 documentaries worth watch-
ing. Most of these are available on Netflix
‘instantly.

Here are the ﬁrst ﬁve. Tune in next week

for the next half of the list.

10. “Beats, Rhymes and Life: The
Travels of A Tribe Called Quest”
College-age hip-hop fans often forget
that the genre existed before Lil Wayne
I and Wiz Khalifa. With song themes includ-
ing sex, moneyjand drugs, hip-hop fans
with a more reﬁned taste ‘in’ lyrical and
musical content migjht-‘ask: ‘Is there more
outthere?  in  _
n _ Fortunately for j’these.. fans, director
Michael Rapaport presents the saga of
legendary hip-hop group A Tribe Called
Quest, consisting of Q-Tip, Phife Dawg,
Jarobi White and Ali Shaheed Muhammad.
With interviews from admiring artists such
as Kanye West and whimsical Afrocentric
animations, Rapaport chronicles the rise
and fall of A Tribe Called Quest and the al-
ternative hip-hop scene.
Because of its focus on the intricacies of
hip-hop and the trials and tribulations of
a group of friends who happened to hit it

 

big, “Beats, Rhymes and Life” is a must-see
for fans of The Tribe and music fans alike.

9. “More Than a Game”
For those who have participated in a
team sport, the feeling of camaraderie

after a crucial win is like nothing else. In .

“More Than a Game,” director Kristopher
Belman examines this bond between team-
mates ‘bye followingffour young’ basketball
playerston their journeys to success. It
begins with Akron, 0hio’s Amateur Ath-
letic Union squad, the Shooting Stars, and
moves to the team’s success at state and
national championships in Saint Vincent-
Saint Mary’s High School.

Throughout their time together the
team members face a multitude of chal-
lenges, including racial tension in a nearly
all-white Catholic school, the diminutive
stature of pointguard Dru Joyce III, per-
sonal issues of power forward Romeo Tra-
vis and eligibility diﬂiculties of teammate

and current. NBA.sup<érstar“LeBron]ames. '

The ﬁlm portrays how coach Dru Joyce
II leads the team through its triumphs and
tribulations, culminating in one of the
greatest amateur basketball teams ever as-
sembled.

8. “Best Worst Movie”

If you were to a read a description of a
movie including vegetarian goblins trans-
forming humans into plants in order to
consume them, would you watch it?

In “Best Worst Movie,” director Michael
Stephenson answers that very question by
examining the cult following behind “Troll
2,” a ﬁlm considered the worst movie ever
made. Stephenson, who performed in the
ﬁlm, follows Alabama dentist George Har-
dy, who starred in the ﬁlm while working
as a dentist in Utah.

Along with the other members of the
cast and director Claudio Fragasso, Hardy
tours the country to visit screenings of
“Troll 2” in front of raucous and adoring
fans. Undoubtedly, the most enduring im-
pression of the ﬁlm is the humility of the
movies actors and their reaction to the
cult fame. '

By combining hilarious re—enactments
of the ﬁlm by the amateur actors with real
footage from the insanely awful ﬁlm, the
director creates a thoughtful and good-na-
tured chronicle of a group of average joes.

7. “Bowling for Columbine”
Michael Moore, director of “Bowling
for Columbine,” will never be mistaken

for a credible journalist because of his lack-

of balance and professionalism. Despite
these ﬂaws, Moore presents a documen-
tary in “Bowling for Columbine” with a
curious dichotomy; it’s both hilarious and
terrifying at the same time.

Traveling to different corners of the
country, Moore exposes the gun-clinging
culture iniAmerica that factored into the
deaths of 12 students and one teacher at
Columbine High School in Colorado on
April 20, 1999.

Moore accomplishes this in a humor-
ous manner, opening an account at a bank
in Michigan in order to receive a free gun
and speaking with members of the Michi-
gan Militia who published a calendar wit

‘women holding heavy ﬁrearms. '

Rather than simply attacking the Sec-
ond Amendment, Moore examines how

‘news stations disproportionately show

murder stories despite a drop in the crime
rate overthe .last 20 years. I V

Essentially, Moore portrays the indoc-
trination of fear into the minds of Ameri-
cans, creating a documentary that appeals
to anyone, regardless of his political ideol-
ogy. -

6. “Maxed Out”

For incoming college students, receiv-
ing a credit card represents freedom from
paycheck to paycheck purchases. Unfor-

tunately, a majority of these students are

unaware of the dire consequencesof irre-
sponsible credit card use. Even fewer are
aware that this debt is exactly what credit
card companies hope to maximize.

“More Than .1 «mm-

 

Not only does “Maxed Out” explore the
predatory practices, of credit card com-
panies, it also examines the relationship
between the federal government and the
ﬁnancial service industry.

In order to explore the impact of these
predatory practices at an individual level,
directorjames Scurlock contrasts the lives
of credit card company employees with
people who are suffering ﬁnancial ruin be-
cause of the predation. ' .» ‘ _

“Maxed Out” provides a cautionary tale
to all who -seek the buying-on-credit life-
style. § ‘

You step into the bar, eyes auto-
matically scanning the scene for

, familiar faces. Suddenly, they
land on an interesting sight.
Your stomach starts to turn and
a thin ﬁlm of sweat forms on
your brow.

But this isn’t any sort ‘of at-
traction you’re feeling. No, clad
in a bright‘ ﬂannel shirt and
jeans cut just north of the knee,
this person is instilling in you
the utmost disdain. Suppressing
this wave of emotions, you man-
age to coolly remark to a nearby
friend, “Well,would you look at
that f**king hipster.” p

I’ll wager. many of youican
identify with this scenario, and
at the very least you’ve probably
calledsomeone a hipster before.
The mainstream culture has
found it can boast its hipness by
taking notice of an underground
scene with the word “hipster.”

But does this attention actu-
ally provide any insight? The an-
swer is no. It’s just a stale trend
that needs to make way for more
discerning cultural critiques.

As a member of the self-pro-
claimed “Pittsburgh’s Progres-
sive FM,” I’ve seen ﬁrsthand
how easy it is to cross the ﬁne
line between progressive and
pretentious. I’ve' discovered

that the problem lies in a mis-

guided sense of authenticity. By
tryingto constantly categorize
the trends that surround them,
people develop a subconscious
elitism that ends up manifesting
itself in the phrase “hipster.”

It’s worth noting the elusive
nature of the word’s deﬁnition.
Asking ﬁve diife°rent people
what a hipster is will likely yield
ﬁve differing descriptions with
a, few overlapping characteris-
tics. This inconsistency further
suggests how little purpose the
word actually serves as a prag-
matic classiﬁcation. ‘ 1

There’s no way around -it;

.Whether we’re talking musical

genres (chillwave, witch—house,

'slut—wave), fashion (ironic T-

shirts, grandpa glasses, seapunk)

or other miscellaneous trends‘

(used book stores, quinoa, PBR),

there is a constant ebb and ﬂow _

of ideas. Categorizing and keep-
ing up with these. trends often
leads to an oversimpliﬁcation
that everyone — from amateur
blogs to reputable media sourc-
es —- buys into. ,

This desire to keep with the
trends combines with the need
to feel authentic. It results in a
slew of blogs covering extreme-
ly diverse topics, ranging from
hipsters in music to hipsters in
Portland.

fend one’s authenticity than by V

‘Salmon Fishing’ not a mainstreamromantic-comedy

By Anna Weldon‘
Senior Staff Writer

“Salmon~Fishin'g in the Yemen” isn’t just
for those with an affinity for ﬁsh.

Cultures collide and mesh in this ro-
mantic comedy that brings an unrealistic,
dream tolife. Intertwining Western and
Middle Eastern cultures, the ﬁlm. success-
fully unravels a plot that has much more to
offer than simple commentary on the art
of ﬁshing. .

The movie brings three unlikely char-
acters together as they try to make salmon
ﬁshing possible in the dry regions of Ye-
men. The' visionary Sheikh Muhammed
(Amr -Waked)Awants to bring the sport of
salmon ﬁshing to his’ home country —
which consists almost entirely of desert —
despite many conservative dissenters he
encounters while pursuing the project.

Dr. Alfred Jones (Ewan McGregor) is
Britain’s leading ﬁsh expert, and because
of his vast knowledge of salmon ﬁshing,
he gets reeled in to the sheikh’s‘plan. The
sheikh’s representative, Harriet (Em-
ily Blunt), coaxes him to participate in the
project, which he initially believes to be
impossible. * 7

Once Dr. Jones reluctantly agrees to

lead the project, but he makes outlandish ‘

demands in return. for his services. The
over—welcoming actions of the sheikh force
Dr. Jones and Harriet to have more faith in

his vision, which he throws away his job

and wife for by the movie’s end.

But the ﬁlm holds deeper meaning than
can be found solely in salmon ﬁshing. The
combination of Western and Middle East-
ern cultures, clearly attempts to make a
statement. _

The sheikh, whose modern views align
with his traditional Islamic beliefs, wants
to bring a part of his Western lifestyle to
share with his people. The movie creates
an optimistic perception ‘of the differ-
ing views between the two cultures. This
grand theme separates the ﬁlm from the

traditional romantic comedy, giving; it

more depth. It demonstrates a very cul-
tural perspective through each character’s
distinct background ‘and the- diverse set-
tings, which range from Britain to Yemen.

*But the ﬁlm= doesn’t° totally focus on-

this meshing of cultures — it has many
relatable moments for the audience. Even

' though the title implies a strong ﬁshing
component, the movie seemsto make a

statement about the hilarity of ﬁshing as
a sport. These subtle hints at comedy help
lighten the intense nature of the movie.

In its best moments, the “American Pie”
movies provided a slice of life for suburban

franchise’s ability to connect with young

only explanation for a series reboot.

Unfortunately, thesincere moments in
“American Reunion” are too few and the

nostalgic "pandering too plentiﬁil for the '

movie to be a success.

ing of “Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.”
Harriet’s exaggerated relationship with a
British soldier takes away from the cultural
commentary and even makes the movie
feel overwrought at times.

Dr. Jones also struggles in his personal
relationship, which leads him to Harriet.
This inclusion does not seem necessary
among the many other aspects of the mov-
ie, but it does appeal to a certain audience.
For those interested in a love story, “Salm—
on Fishing in the Yemen” includes a few
mainstream facets to appeal to a broader
audience.

Regardless of the inanity of several of
the characters’ relationships, the movie
continues to deliver something more than
a typical romantic comedy. The cultural
facets and vaguely funny moments pull the
less-than—desirable instances along and
keep viewers interested. _

But for those who want simply to watch
a movie about the principles of salmon
ﬁshing, it’s best to return to the television

tual approach risks sucking some char-
acter out of the topic.

As much as the term “hipster” is
abused, I will acknowledge that it has
some usefulness. After all, there are
people who make it their sole purpose to
listen to hands before anyone else does,
and “hipster” has become a convenient
way ofclassifying that pretentious mind-
set. .

Still, the overuse of the word has made
it even more irritating than the hipsters
themselves ever were. Most irksome is
when someone is a self-proclaimed hip-

ster, laughing at his or her affinity for
thrift stores, ﬁxies and obscure coffee
while making a visit to thatsnotironic.
corn. '

It’s our generation’s pale attempt of
approximating culture into a series of
hollow memes, blogs and other jokes
that ultimately overuses the word. I’ll ad-
mit that at ﬁrst these jabs at hipsterdom
can be entertaining, but now they have
overstayed their welcome. I

Let’s cut to the chase: If you used the
term freely before, you probably aren’t
going to stop after reading this article.
In the end, you choose your own vocabu-
lary, and each person has his or her own
personal deﬁnition for the colloquial-
ism. -

All I ask is that before you decry the
next mustachioed, twentysomething you
see holding a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon,
take a second to ponder what the word
really means and what you’re actually

trying to say. Consider that maybe this , ,

guy is just a poor, college student —
hence the PBR —- and looks damn good
with a mustache —— hence the mustache.

Most importantly, remember this:
Hipsters can be people too. §

Isaiah Epps   to trans)‘

By Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt men’s basketball head coach
Jamie Dixon announced the trans-
fer of Isaiah Epps on Wednesday.
Epps, a redshirt freshman
guard from Plainﬁeld, N.J., is
transferring due to family-related
reasons, according to the Univer-

sity. Epps spent the season play-
ing behind starting point guard
Travon Woodall and backup John
Johnson.

“We have been in constant

communication with Isaiah re- -

garding his family’s well-being,”
Dixon said in a press release.

“We believe that it is best for '

Isaiah to be close to home, and
we will assist him in ﬁnding the

er for family-related reasons

best possible situation to reach '

his goals -— both academically
and athletically. He’s a great kid,
hard worker and good player. We
thank Isaiah for his contribution
to our program over thelast two
years and wish him much success
in the future.” .
Epps_ will get a full release
from his scholarship. The release
is granted by University ofﬁcials,

who have the right to prevent
Epps from leaving if they want.
Because the release is being made
after the season, Epps’ eligibility
for next year won’t be affected.
Epps is the second player, to
transfer from Pitt this year, and
the team hasn’t announced where
he will end up, although Athletic
Department representatives in-
dicated it will be closer to home.

Fortunately,‘ the Panthers al-
ready addressed the guard situa-
tion-for next season. James Rob-
inson, a 6—foot-3 point guard from

9 DeMatha Catholic High School in

Hyattsville, Md., is a member of

two games and played in 19 for
the Panthers, averaging 0.1 points
and 0.2 rebounds per game. I

Pens, Flyers set for
  brawl in playoffs

By Donnie Tasser
Staff Writer

Bring on Filthadelphia.

With their win over the
Flyers on Tuesday, the New York
Rangers clinched the Atlantic
Division and the top seed in the
NHL’s Eastern Conference, which
sets the stage for another classic
Penguins—Flyers playoff matchup.
'And I can’t wait, especially after
Sunday’s 6-4 Flyer victory was
marred by an entertaining free-
for-all at the end of the game. _

It’s only natural that the
pre—playoff atmosphere caused
tensions to be high most of the
game. Sidney Crosby got away
with a slash on Flyer’s star Claude

'Giroux, then took a cheap shot,

cross-check by Brayden Schenn.

Penguins chose to play their

Schenn’s “cheap shot” on Crosby
and the fact that after the Vitale
hit, Laviolette broke a stick ——
part of which ended up in the
Penguins’ bench area. After the
game, the Flyers announced that
Briere was out indeﬁnitely with

’l'hr: Penguins and Flyers have made it a habit to play ]>lI,\4’sical hockey this season.

And seeing as the two teams
are virtually cemented into the
fourth andlﬁfth seeds, we’ll get
to witness an exciting Keystone
State matchup featuring the best
rivalry in the game. The only
question at this point is, if there
is a Game 7, at which end of the
state will it be located?

Pittsburgh currently holds

, the higher seed, with a three-

point edge over the Flyers and
two games to play. However, this
situation might actually bode
well for Philadelphia, as the team
is 5-0 thus far at Consol Energy
Center.

me while it excites me. On one
hand, there is nothing better than
eliminating your bitter rival from
the playoffs (remember 2008 and
2009, Flyers fans?). But at the

worthy of an Eastern Conference

Kings’ youth, future draft  
    picks bring hope    

By Nate Barnes;
Staff Writer ' “

After spending much of the past 10 years
in a downward spiral, things are starting
to look up for the Sacramento Kings
franchise. , "

Not only will the team be staying in
Sacramento after experiencing questions
regarding the franchise’s ﬁnances and
arena situation,‘ the Kings also have a
young core of players who will continue

to restore strength to one of the greatest -

basketballtowns in America.
Despite what their record indicates, the

- Kings have had some success this season. At

19-35, the majority of their wins have come
against teams who will be participating in
the playoffs. 

Sacramento defeated the Los Angeles
Lakers in their season opener 100-91 on
Dec. 26. On Jan. 20, the Kings eked out an
88-86 win over the San Antonio Spurs, who
currently hold the Western Conference’s
No. 2 seed» in this year’s playoffs.

On Feb. 9, the Kings =§1efeated arguably
the best team in the league with a 106-101
win over the‘ Oklaho‘ma"City Thunder. A
month later they defeated the defending
champion Dallas Mavericks, another team
set to make a trip to the postseason.

Unlike any of these teams, however, the
Kings will not see the playoﬂ°s this year.
But the end of the season should bring

excitement to the city’s fans. With their

record at 19—35, the Kings should end up
with a top—10 pick in this year’s NBA Draft.
This year’s draft class features an especially
high level of talent, and the Kings will
be able to select from players like Andre
Drummond, Harrison Barnes, the Zeller
brothers and Perryjones. A I A; _
Any one of those players could
contribute immediately and help add to
the Kings’ wintotal next season. What will

certainly add to that total is the experience

gained by the Kings’ younger p1ayers,jwho
form a core that will be formidable for
years to come. A  '

Combo guard,'I‘yreke Evans» heads up 7
the Kings young talent. Drafted with the.
No. 4 overall pick in 2009 out of Memphis,‘
Evans has contributed. from the moment’.

he arrivedgin Sacramento. Evans /possesses

the ability to penetrate to the basket a'_tany_

cost with his incredible. combination of
strength and speed. '

In his rookie season, ‘Evans averaged"

Final, not its ﬁrst round. Although I believe
that the Penguins will win (in seven, if you
must know), there is not a team in the East
that I believe can beat the Pens — except
for theiBullies across the state.

But before all of this goes down, we
get another playoff preview. Regardless of
whether or not the fourth seed is up in the
air, expect a heated battle between the two
teams in the regular seasonyﬁnale Saturday

that will only serve as further kindling for ‘

the rivalry. Which team is going to sign the

team in scoring with 16.9 points per game
and still leads the team in assists with 4.8 a
game, despite not running the point.

Speaking of Thomas, the rookie out of

S Washington has spurred more revival in
Sacramento. Selected as the last pick in the
most recent NBA Draft,’ Thomas averages

_ 11 points and 3.8 assists per game and has

started in 25 games so far.

His backcourt mate Thornton provides
the scoring ﬂare that prevents defenses
from keying in on Evans alone. Sacramento
acquired Thornton in a trade with the New
Orleans Hornets‘ prior to last season’s
trade deadline, exchanging power forward
Carl Landry for the guard.

The 24-year-old guard out of Louisiana
State leads the Kings in scoring at 18.7
points per game. Kings fans saw Thornton’s
scoring potential when he arrived last
season and was .afforded the chance at
consistent minutes after being buried

on New Orleans’ bench. After the -trade,
Thornton averaged 21.3 points per game
and shot 45 percent from the ﬁeld.

In the paint, the Kings are anchored by
power forward DeMarcus Cousins. Drafted
out of Kentucky in‘ the 2010 NBA Draft
with‘ the No.5 pick, Cousins faced high
expectations his rookie year. In his rookie
campaign, Cousins “fulﬁlled fans’ hopes
by starting 62 games, scoring 14.1 points
per game and pulling down 8.7 rebounds
a night.

With the promise he showed, Cousins
continued to develop. But of concern to
Kings fans is Cousins’ bad attitude, which
resulted in his sitting out a_string of games
early this year. .

_ Fortunately, Cousins is beginning t
put those questions to rest and is putting
together a spectacular season. Averaging
a double—double on the season, Cousins is
second on the team in scoring (averaging

.18.2 points) and leads the team in

rebounding at 11.1 rebounds per game. N
‘With these players in place and

continuing to develop, expect the Kings.

to become playoff contenders within the
near future. The addition of one of the very
talented players available in this year’s

1 draft will further the restoration process

in Sacramento and continue to revitalize
one of basketball’s best cities. ﬂ
