CORRECTION

Veterans who are recalled to
active service will have only the
remainder of the semester's time
added to their GI Bill. However,
it a veteran volunteers or drops
out of school because of illness,
he automatically loses the entire
semester.

In addition, only men drafted
into the armed forces will receive
benefit of a tuition refund.

A

Civil Defense Progam"

On Tap for Next Monti

An integated program for the

the event of an air attack on the city is already on the books, and
will be ready for operation by mid-
Based on the plan developed during the last war by Dr. ‘John J.

protection of the University in

January. ‘

Geise, professor of history the Atomic Age version is being

plotted by Viers Adams, Director

of the Ellsworth Center.

Mr. Adams, appointed to the post
last summer by Chancellor Rufus H.
Fitzgerald, showed evidence that

institutions in its preparation for
possible all-out air warfare.

A Start At Least

When national educators met in
Washington late this summer, Pitt
was the only university represented
which had even gone as far as
appointing a civil defense director.

Locally, the University's pro-
gram has been delayed somewhat
by the city and -
countrywide organ-
ization, which is
still in the outline
stage.

Mr. Adams indi-
cated that the pro-
gram is aimed at
enabling each in-
dividual to take
care of himself in
case of an air raid,
rather than count-
ing on wardens or

 

_ dams
aid teams who themselves might be-

injiried by an atomic attack.

Personnel Needed
The program, however, will re-
quire service ‘by both faculty and
student volunteers, in capacities
ranging from messengers to radia-
tion control specialists.
ACommittees directing preparations
in individual areas have been meet-
ing regularly, and should have their
plans completed by the middle of
next month. The over-all program,
handled directly by Mr. Adams, will
be» completed and ready for publi-
cation at that time, also.

Debaters Cop
High Ratingsl

Six Pitt debaters won “excel
ent” ratings in the thirdannu
Pitt cross-examination deba
tournament last weekend. “

A total of 14 colleges were re
presented with 93 debaters partic
paring. No superior scores we
compiled, the highest being 89. ll

The "excellent” Pitt debater
were: varsitymen, Edward Burte
and Eugene Weinstein; i3-Y'Ve
members, Cyril Wecht and Ros
Reese; and women; Ann Prisuta an
Dorothy Gessner.

Pitt students debating were: val
sity: Edward Burtell, Eugene Weir
stein, Bernard McGowan, and Larr
Moreau; junior varsity: Cyril Wecht
Ross Reese, Roy Nelson, and Lud
wig Lippert; novices: ElmerSchust-e
Daniel Berger, Samuel Seigle, an
Raymond Moran; women: Ann Pri
suta, Dorothy Gessner, Doris Lyda
and Louise Edge. :

The subject discussed was, “Re
solved, that the Non-communis
Nat-ions Should Form a New Inter
national Organization.”

GRADE CHECK

Seniors in the College who ex-
pect to graduate in June and'whoa_
have not had their records check-
ed in recent months, should at-
range for appointments at the Col-
lege Office, 1801 Cathedral of
Learning. The record should be
checked between now and Janu-
ary 15.

SC Opens Spring Festival Jobs

Earl Jacob, chairman of Student Congress’ Appointments Com-
mittee, bad news of interest this week for anyone who aspires to
position on two of the spring’s most important social events.

He announced at Monday's SC meeting that applications are

being accepted for the posts of
chairman, business manager, and
publicity chairman for both the
Military Ball and the Spring Festi-
va .

Applications Available

Those interested in the Spring
Festival may obtain applications
and the necessary information from
Miss Thomas in the\Dean of Men's
office. The applications should be
returned to her by Jan. 5, 1951.

The students who are eventually
chosen for the Festival posts will
have the record set by last year's
Festival to shoot for.

Financially at least, it was a
success. The big event, the Car-
nival, was attended by over 10,000
people and netted a profit of about
$1600. This was enough to cover
loses by several of the other events
and the overall profit for the Week
was 3230.

Those interested in the Military
Ball may pick upapplications from
Capt. Hall at ROTC headquarters
on the 4th floor. These, too, should
be returned to him by Jan. 5.

Jacob said that this year more

emphasis will be put on the military

aspect of the ball than was the
case last year. The three campus
military fraternities’ Scabbard and
Blade, the Arnold Air Society, and
the Pershing Rifles will be urged
to give full support to the affair.

Herman Levy then reported as a
committee of one on his investiga-
tion into the problem of what Con-
gress can do for Pitt men called to
the services.

Levy, who has a particularly keen
interest in the problem, (he took his
physical on Monday) said that so
far he sees.four possible projects
which, Congress might promote:

 

(1) establish an honor roll; (2) give
each serviceman a subscription t ‘
the Pitt News; (3) collect campu:l
news items of a personal nature foil
the News; and (4) give an award to
the campus organization whichﬁisl
most active in the program.

Vew Photo Library Records Life

By JAY AUSLANDER
Pitt’s new Photographic Library, established last June on the
36th floor Cl.,, is doing an amazing job of accomplishing its pur-
pose. That aim is to develop a documentary collection of photo-
graphs on the life, activities, and achievements of the people of
Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, and Western Pennsylvania with

relation to their physical environ-
ment.

The Pitt photo-project's director
is Roy E. Stryker, ex-chief of the
photographic division of public
relations of the Standard Oil Com-
pany of New Jersey. Hr. Stryker
was also director of photographic
projects for the Farm Security Ad-
ministration of the United States
Department of Agriculture, prior to
his appointment with Standard Oil
in 1943. During World War II he

I‘ruman Talks

On {Children

President Harry S. Truman, in an
address to the Mid-Century White
House Conference on Children and
Youth, attended by members of the
‘University Faculty last week,
stressed the importance of mental
health and well being in our child-
ren.

Among the Faculty who attended

the conference were: Wilbur I. New‘-
stettgr, dean of the school of Soc-
i.al Work; Miss Eleanor Cockerill,
also a professor in the School of
iisocial Work and Dr. Maurice'].
’é:Thomas’, professor of education.
 The, general theme of the con-
;:ference concerned ‘all of the things
;‘%that promote the development of a
ihealthy personality in the nation’s
jlchildren.
_ Emphasis was placed on the im-
portance of mental health for child-
ren and on the importance of ap-
proaching problems by using all of
the material and information avail-
able.

supervised the gathering of 250,000
photographs depicting the ‘-'Ameri-
can scene” for the Office of War
Information.

“Photographer's Paradise"

Assisting Mr. Stryker with his
work is his close friend and as-
sociate at Standard Oil, Harold
Cassini, nationally famous free
lance "photog.”

Project director Stryker says he's
happy to be in Pittsburgh, and part-
icularly at Pitt, where he can help
Pitt to further its place in com-
munity life.

Mr. Stryker considers Pitts-
burgh's physical layout” a magnifi-
cent and fascinating site for camera
work.”

“It's literally a photographers
paradise” he said while glancing
out at the view from his office on
the technical "top floor” of the
Cathedral.

"When I was with Standard Oil
my photo-coverage was world-wide,
now it's just one county, with most

of my work being done right here
in this office,” Mr. Stryker ex-
claimed.

Published by LIFE

The Photo Library's first assign-
ment was the extensive photography
for the Pittsburgh Community Chest
drive. The job came just after Mr.
Stryker set up his office in the Cl.
Two photographers, friends and
past employees of Mr. Stryker, were
hurriedly summoned from New York
to help with the assignment. The
job was just recently completed,
although Life magazine earlier
published part of the survey.

Offers Many Services

Under Mr. Stryker’s guidance the
project hopes to prove its educa-
tional and social value to the Uni-
verstiy and the community so that
it will become a permanent part of
the University's service to the area.

Mr. Stryker hopes to have work
available soon for Pitt students
with photographic ability on a full
or part-time basis.

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests

Number 9...'l'l-IE MARSH HEN

“For a while they had me swamped!”

Seems like this confused fowl got mixed in a metaphor *-1--———-*

and was almost turned into a guinea pig. The story goes she

got caught in a welter of quick-trick cigarette tests . . . one
puff of this brand, then a puff of that . . . a sniff, a whiff ——.a fast

inhale and exhale. And then she was supposed to know all about

cigarette mildnessl Is that the way to treat a lady?

And is that the way to judge a cigarette?

We think not. That’s why we suggest:

The sensible test — The 30-Day Camel Mildness Test,

which simply asks you to try Camels as your steady smoke —

on a pack after pack, day after day basis. No snap

judgments needed. After you’ve enjoyed Camels — and

only Camels - for 30 days in your “T-Zone” (T for

Throat, T for Taste) we believe you’ll know why . . .

More People Smoke Camels

than any other cigarette!

Relaxation, Not Study, Pro f Suggests

B5’ CLARK SUTTON
Drop that book on efficient study methods, the scholar’s

“millenium has arrived!

Dr. Samuel Lowery, of Bowling Green University has news
that should send all date-hungry, schedule-loaded men scuttling

for the nearest telephone.

Pension Law

Affects Profs

All college personnel will be
effected by the change in the Social
,Security law enacted at the last
session of Congress. If the change

goes into effect here, personnel
will receive Social Security bene-
fits instead of Teachers Insurance
and Annuity Association benefits.
Previously no school was elig-
ible under the Federal Social Sec-
iurity benefits. Now all school
personnel will be covered.

He says that male students, in:
order to pass their subjects, should
relax. ,

But that isn’t all.

He also advocates that they go
out on more dates. "More dates
mean better marks,” he says, “and
frequent dating enlarges a student's
interests.”

Do you like to putter, go out on
dates, collect bottle caps, or simply
enjoy the feeling of ease and well
being of abandoning yourself to a
good cigar and a pet day dream?

Dr. Lowery says you should.

To make certain, you can relax,
perhaps you’d better double check

yourself on the following quiz ad-

vanced by the Bowling Green prof:

1) Do you plan your time so that
even under the most hectic sched-
ule, you get a chance for a real
breather?

2) Do you have several hobbies?
They need not run to formal collec-
tions like stamps, (but can involve
girls.)

3) Can you forget work problems
out on a date?

4) Can you cat-nap?

_ 5) Can you sleep at night, even

Clothes to Korea

By today the YWCA had sent 12
boxes of clothing to Korea. The Y

more by me end of this week.

The clothingis being sent through
the YWCA Emergency Committee. Dr.

faculty at a north Korean university,
is now in South Korea helping to
distribute the food and clothing.

Longsoo Song, a foreign student

from Korea, has been helping the
Y members to prepare their clothing
packages. Faculty and students are
asked to help by bringing in old
clothing to the 12th floor YWCA

~ Med School Doubletatlk ,

, By MYRON KOPELMAN

‘You had to feel sorry for Dr. Richard Horn, assistant dean of
themedical school. Doctor Horn was up there at the lectern, dur-
ing the Pre-Med Forum last week, trying to defend intelligently an

unintelligent situation.

Dr. llorn had b-een asked the whys
and wherefores of the racial and

‘religious questions contained in the

application forms of the medical
school.

What followed was a display of

verbal gymnastics which left_ the
listener with perhaps less enlight-
enment than he had previously pos-

ll words, Dr. Horn handled himself
beautifully. From there on in, you
had to be on your toes to follow him.

Asked why the application form
contains racial and religious ques-
tions, Dr. Horn replied that they
"had been in the form since 1909.,’

"Is that, then, the reason?” he

S€SS€d- . was pressed. J
t - ’
No Quofg‘, ‘ ‘That is oneof the reasons,” the

Dr. Horn started out, in answer to doctor answered-
an ‘inquiry, by declaring, "There is Statements Ul|d|'OISOd

We asked in the most convincing manner possible. And what did

We got eight people to sign up to donate a pint of blood each

Director of Publications, the other was a friend of the editor. .

brethren, you have done it unto me.”
Thank you. i

A wise Solution

As we contemplate another Christmas recess, we’d like to
extend a pat on the back to the Chancellor and the University
Deans who left the recess untouched, even though students and
faculty had already enjoyed an unofficial week's vacation due to
the ‘big snow.’

The extending of classes through examination week, rather
than taking‘ time from the scheduled Christmas vacation or the
mid-term recess was the best possible solution to all the pro-
blems brought on by the late, great snowfall.

It satisfied the state and accrediting demands for a fifteen-
week semester, yet permitted students to work or rest during the
pre- and post-Christmas holidays. It left the mid-term free for
grades to be recorded, and kept the already-planned 1950 Uni-
versity schedule from getting jammed up.

All in all, it was a wise solution.

* 3|! * * * * * *

We’ve heard that officials and students of other institutions
of higher learning have been looking down their noses at Pitt
because recess time was not cut for make-up purposes. If so, we
can only point out that Pitt has lost no class time, nor has its
solution worked hardship with anyone. And we predict that, while
Pitt takes the interruption in stride, these other schools will be
paying for their holiday twice over in extra time, expense, and

I can only undress his statements of
their extraneous, roundabout diver-
gences and produce, in so many
words, the core. And the core has it
that members of the community con-
sider re ligious and racial background
when selecting their physicians,
ard that after all, it is the duty of
the medical schools to’ supply the
wants of the community.

If that is‘ the duty of a medical
school, then Pitt’s certainly should
have quotas. Yet the good doctor
says it does not.

Actually, he left the impression
that Pitt does have a quota system,
but that it is one which is not down
on paper so as to provide critics
with proof positive. It seems to be
filed away conveniently in the heads
of those who process the applications.

Circular Talk

Myimpre ssion may be 100 per cent
wrong, but until such time as medi-
cal school spokesmen quit talking
in circles, no other explanation is
acceptable.

Still, as I said before, you had to

pity Dr. Horn. He had to explain the
inexplicable.
The fact is that Dr. Hogn is not
responsible for the Medical School’s
deplorable enrollment practices.
Nor is Dr. William McEllroy,'dean
of the med school. The ultimate
blame falls on the Board of Trus-
tees, for its members are the boys
who can see to a change if they so
desire.

Western Tourto Test Panthers

\.

Minnesota First Stop
011 Eight Game Trip

By WILL DOERGE
The real test of Pitt’s basketball team begins this Saturday '
when the Panthers play at Minnesota, the first stop on their eight
game western tour over the Christmas holidays.
Pitt now has a 1-1 record in collegiate play after beating
Gettysburg, 65-50, at Gettysburg last Saturday.
. Following the Minnesota game, Dr. H.C. Carlson’s hoopsters

will take a sightseeing trip by train
to the West Coast. They’ll play
some basketball, too, meeting some
of the best teams the Pacific
Coast has to offer.

Nothing But Best

Washington, rated to win the Con-
ference crown by most observers, is
Pitt’s first opponent for a two-game
stand, followed by Oregon State for
two games, California, and UCLA.

Then, to finish off the tour, the
Panthers meet Iowa on the way back
from the Coast. Iowa, by the way, is
only rated the best team in the ‘Big
Ten.

If the Panthers can return home
with a fairly respectable record af-
ter these games, they’ll have won
their spurs for the 1950-51 cam-
paign. ‘3ut it’s going to be plenty
tough.

Twelve to Go

A party of twelve will make the
trip - Carlson, llead Manager Jim
Harper, and ten players. They will

week.”

Belich on Fire

Certain to make the trip, how-
ever, are Regulars Mike Belich,
George Hromanik, Bob Yurko, and
Mickey 7.ernich.

Belich, 5-7 guard from Duquesne,
has been the sparkplug of theiPan-
thers in their first two games.
Against Gettysburg, Mike made 11
of 19 shots from the field, scor-
ing a total of 24 points to bring his’
season’s output to 39 points in two
games.

Sophomores will probably domin-i

are the remainder of the Pitt squad
making the trip.
To Face All-Americans

On the trip, Pitt will oppose ‘se-'

veral players who have been pre-
season All-American candidates,
such as Whitey Skoog of Minne-
Sota, Frank Calsbeek of Iowa,
Frank Guisness of Washington, and
Eddie Sheldrake of UCLA.

Carlson has not yet decided on
the players he will take along. To-
day is the big day for his team, for
Doc will decide which players to
take.

“Picking the ten is going to be a
very difficult job,” said Carlson.

By MYRON KOPELMAN

Sports Editor

Almost. That's as far as Dr. H.C. Carlson is going to get in
his effort to regain a respectable name for Pitt in basketball
circles. Almost, butgnot far enough.

Not since 1941, when the Pan-
thers went to the Eastern Colleg-
iates, has Carlson had a "loaded”
team. His material, for the most
part, has consisted of seconds. A
exceptions
would usuallyturn
up on his squads,
and he would par-
lay these men plus
a configuration of
clever play pat-
terns into periodic
major upsets, thus
preserving a mini-
mum of self-dig-1
nity for Cathedral
__ U.
adson In the last analy-
sis, though, the Panthers were con-
sistently minor league.

Remedy Started

Last year the first remedialsteps
were taken. The Athletic Office
gave Doc the word. to go ahead and
recruit a few high school stars. He
was not empowered to stage a goon
harvest, mind you, but he was able
to attract a group of freshmen who
scaled more than six feet and
possessed moderate ability.

Well, the frosh lost only three
games last year, and while their

, record provided no indication that

Pitt would shortly be back in the
big time, their success undeniably
represented a start in the right di-
rection.

Now those same frosh are on the

varsity. One of them, Forward
Mickey Zemich, shows all the
signs of stardom. But like the

others, he is a mere sophomore, and
his ilk do not set the world on fire
when confronted with a schedule
which has them playing almost 75
per cent of their contests on the
road. ‘

But they will gain valuable ex-

perience. They will assuredlyyripen.

Fieldhouse III-fated, Too
Coincidental with the improve-
ment in material has been the form-
ing of plans for a fieldhouse to
house any strong teams which the

future might produce. After two
fumbling years, pockmarked by
labor strikes, blueprint revisions,
and what not else, the construction

work is finally rolling and should
be finished in time for next season.
But the fieldhouse, like Doc
Carlson, is destined to fall short
of its mark. It will not be the scene
of high caliber
contests, next
year, not the year
after. No glorious
fate immediately
awaits it.
For while many
persons in sports
I are having diffi-
ulty reconciling

  
 
 
  
  
   
 
 
  

"on. Full-scale

Zemich
mobilization is imminent. Right _now
sports is having its last fling.

Whether Doc Carlson could have

proved his “continuity” system
would work with the proper mater-
ial will remain a moot question. I
prefer to think it would have, and
for evidence I refer you to Miss-
ouri’s 54-37 thumping of a super-
ior CCNY team Saturday night.

Missouri played scientifically,
like a Carlson team -- only with
material.

Wrestlers In
First Meet

The 1950-51 edition of Coach Rex
Peery’s wrestling team will be un-
veiled this weekend at Gettysburg
on Friday and Indiana Teachers
Saturday.

“We are simply bound to improve
this year, if only because of added
experience,” Peery- commented this
week. His team went winless last
year.

The short-sized coach was loud
in his praise of sophomore John
George, 123-pound grappler. "He’s
come along as well as any man on
the squad,” said Peery.

Last year the Panthers were
beaten by both Gettysburg and
Indiana Teachers.

Pitt's probable starting lineup
Friday .will include: John George,
123-pound class; Ray Cappelli,
130; Harold. Miller, 137; Mike Pappas,
147; Jim Conklin, 157; Tony Raz-
anno, 167; A1 Martini or Bill Ewing,
177, and John Masarik, unlimited.

Record Broken

» The game for the IM champion-
ship has already been postponed
four times, breaking the all-time
Pitt record set just two weeks ago.

Transferred from the week of the

_big snow to last week, several ten-

_/

tative dates were set but these came

. and passed with no game.

Then this week was decided upon.
Again inclement weather prevailed,
and the issiie is still in doubt.

Getting Tiresome

Undoubtedly the Psi O and Delt
squads are getting tired of being
hepped up over the big game, then
having another anti-climax.

To add to the present baffle, af-
ter the Pitt IM championship is de-
cided the IM champs meet the best
team from Tech to decide the all-
Oakland Championship. It is hoped
that this game will be finished be-
fore baseball season.

But all rumors to the effect that
the IM title tilt will be moved to the
Orange Bowl in Miami are flatly
denied‘.

IM, Hoopsters
Getting Set

With the start of the new year,
the intramural sports scene at Pitt
will see the beginning of the major
winter sport. That sport, of course,
is basketball.

This year’s scene will probably
see some familiar faces and jet-
sies on the floor. Phi Epsilon Pi,
fraternity league champions for
the last three years, will prob-
ably again enter another‘power-
house, with three of last year’s
first stringers back. Holdovers
are Herb Schultz, Stewie Klein,
and Nat Landerman. I

Last year, in addition to their
IF laurels, they were also runners-
up in the all-campus tilt.

The ’49-’50 all—campus kings,
the Dazzling Dukes, have combin-
ed with the Gophers this season
due to the graduation of many
players on both squads.

Lost One Game

' The Dukes lost only one game
during the regular season, and
finished second in their section.
But during the playoffs,
burned up the court, handing the
Phi Eps a decisive 43'33 defeat to
take the IM title.

They also met the Tech IM
champs, the Emanons, in the All-
Oakland battle. Again they finish-
ed on top, 57"54, and kept the title
of All-Oakland Champions at Pitt
for the fourth straight year.

Nine Loops

Though the complete schedule of
basketball games has not been an-
nounced, there probably will be
eight leagues again this year, as,
last.

Locker Rooml Talks Denied

Male Coach by Girl’s Team

B)’ DAVE GROTJOHAN

While going to Johnstown Center,
D.A. "Red” Paterick, now a Pitt
senior, gritted his teeth, opened his
eyes wider, conceded reluctantly to
being the head coach of the girls’
basketball team.

During the infancy of his coach-
ing career, he had his first headache
before the initial game. Head coach
Paterick was not allowed in the
locker room to fire the girls up for
their game.

While sitting on the bench during
a tight game, one of his top players
suddenly rushed off the floor and
pleaded with him to take her out.
When asked why, the girl replied,
'fMy boy friend just came in, and
I’rn too embarrassed to play in front

of him.
‘Hard to Handle’
These were the problems con-
fronting Coach Paterick. He had the

I'M Too EHBARRASSED To PLAY. MY BOY
’rm€ma is m -rue sT/was.

  

right idea when '1: said "Girls are
hard to handle."(Here he was not
referring solely to basketball.)

The girls’ basketball games were
preliminaries to the regular games
that Johnstown Center played. Big
crowds came out to see the girls
indulge in the art of basketball.

One thing discovered by Paterick
was that girls are just as much hogs
for glory as boys. The -only position
the girls ever tried out for was for-
ward. The forward is permitted to

in girls’ basketball.

Clean Players

"Something in their favor, though,
is the fact that girls are cleaner
players. I was a little disappointed
that there wasn’t any hair pulling or
slapping,” Paterick mused. R

The girls had an enviable record
of 20 wins with 1 defeat.

Most of the girls were disappointed
when they came to Pitt to discover
that the University had no facilities
for girls’ bask'etbgl_l_,

Likes Coaching

Paterick, now no worse off than
when he started, coaching, hopes
that heimay be able to continue his
coaching career in some way.

He is now a senior in Education,
majoring in geography.

THE DU PONT

DIGEST

  

The 'l'eflon* Problem:

 
   

Given a plastic for which there is no known solvent,
how would you turn it into a coating?

Some time ago Du Pont research dis-
covered a new plastic— “Teﬂon” tet-
raﬂuoroethylene resin. It had tem-
perature resistance beyond the range
of any previous plastic, excellent elec-
trical characteristics, and the highest
degree of chemical inertness among
commercial plastics.

But tough-guy "Teflon” was
almost too tough. It wouldn’t melt
and flow like other plastics. Hence,
it could be molded only in simple
shapes. ‘There was no existing tech-
nique by which it could be made into
thin coatings. Unless this difficulty
could be overcome, the very proper-
ties that made “Teﬂon” so promis-
ing narrowed its usefulness.

"Teflon" Won’? Dissolve

In the past, problems like this have
been handled by dissolving plastics
in a suitable solvent and using them
as the base for enamels and similar
coatings. But "Teﬂon” will not dis-
solve in any solvent yet known. It
even stands up to nitric acid.

At this point Du Pont physical
chemists suggested dispersions-
minute particles suspended in a/ liq-
uid——as the answer. After much
study, scientists of the Polychemicals
Department learned how to suspend
"Teﬂon” particles about 1,125,000
of an inch in diameter. Aided by the
fundamental studies of Chemical
Department scientists. they devised
today's commercial scale process.

Meanwhile Du Pont’s Fabrics and
Finishes Department was keeping
pace with the development. Their
contributions to formulating the new
products did much to establish "Tef-
lon” polytetraﬂuoroethylene coat-
ings and wire enamels in many
special uses.

In electric motors, for instance,
these enamels are used on wire so
the motor can be operated at higher
temperatures and will deliver more
power per unit of weight. Such motors
are more compact and sometimes
cost less.

Other uses include non-sticking
coatings that cut costs when applied
to bakery rolls, rubber molds, heat-
sealing machinery and similar equip-
ment. Corrosion-resistant “Teﬂon"
coatings for special uses are currently
being investigated.

Product of Teamwork .

"Teﬂon" ﬁnishes are a typical fruit
of the close teamwork of Du Pont
technicalmenofdiverse backgrounds.
Organic and physical chemists played
a major role. Physicists participated
by developing fundamental informa-
tion on the nature of the dispersion.
Chemical and mechanical engineers
designed the manufacturing appara-
tus.Working together,they made pos-
sible this new and important addi-
tion to the Du Pont family of "Better
Things for Better Living . . . through

Chemistry." ‘ t * Reg. u. s. Patent on:

Offer Yule Suggestions

3}’ LOIS FOIGHT
Footsore shoppers save their energy if they decide what
they’re looking for beforehand. ‘And Pitt coeds picking up holiday
cash behind the counters this Christmas have many suggestions

to offer for "different” gifts.

Probably the newest kind of gift
this year comes out of Pittsburgh's
two years of television. Carol
Hinds, working with lingerie down-
town, suggests a satin quilted
‘television’ jacket for women of all
ages.

Hopalong for Kids

Children’s toys, too, have a tele-
vision slant... Hopalong Cassidy
suits and pajamas, with a picture
of the hero on the front that glows
in the dark, lead the list. Brenda
McCauley, selling toys in Mt. Leba-
non, suggests a gun handled um-
brella that shoots open for older
children, and stuffed plastic toys
for the infant’s tub.

Hosiery for Coeds

To please the coeds the shopping
list contains decorated hosiery for
special occasions. From her coun-
ter, Pat Gillard offers hand painted
hose and nylons decked with rhine-
stones and pearls. Pat Moffat, a
downtown model, suggests jewelry,
and describes a new, adjustable
necklace which drapes to pin at the
waist.

Older women, who remember the
ornate Christmas tree ornaments of
long ago, might like one for a gift.
According to Anne Curran, many
old-fashioned ornaments “from
grandmother’s day” have been re-
vived this year.
