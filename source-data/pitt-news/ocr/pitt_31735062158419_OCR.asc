New Oakland Plan .

Campus Expansion

By ROSALIE GLAND ¢

The Oakland Chamber of Com-
merce’s proposal to relocate Forbes
Field has no bearing on the Uni-
versity's expansion and redevel-
opment program. Instead it is an
alternate proposal to the planned
North Side site of the city’s muni-
cipal stadium. '

The Chamber met last week
with Park Martin, consultant to
the Chancellor on campus devel-
opment, to discuss a plan sub-
mitted by an 80-year-old engineer,
Charles E. Williams.

Williams’ plan calls for the re-
location of Forbes Field from its
present site to Panther Hollow at
a point between Carnegie Insti-
tute and the Bureau.-of Mines.

Local merchants feel a severe
set-back to the community as
well as a loss of business will re-
sult from the loss of the ball
park. They blame this loss on
the University's proposed rede-
velopment program, which in
fact can be implemented only by
the elimination of Forbes Field
and the rerouting of Forbes Ave.

However, the fact is that the

elimination is not a result of the

Culver Analyzes Beat Generation
As ‘Conforming In Different Way’

, By INA AMDUR

“Since the “Beat Genera-
tion” has received much pub-
licity through their books and
magazines, people should sep-
arate the fact from the-fiction
concerning them.

At a recent meeting of the In-
quiry Club Professor Monty Cul-
ver delivered a lecture on the sub-
ject of the “Beat Generation." ’

First -Culver stated that the
beats, whose dwelling places are
usually in large cities, have “dis-_

affiliated” themselves from our
materialistic society. Anyone who
has not disaﬁiliated himself in
the same manner is labeled a
square.

There is categorical contempt
for anyone in the outside world.
The Beat men usually dress in
dark sweaters and pants, while
the women have long hair and
tight pants also.

Culver disputed the validity
of clothes as a mark of distinc-
tion. He stated, “One can also
write in a Brook Brothers suit.”

The beat language is also
unique. Everyone is called man
whether he be man or woman.
When a man is “gone,” he has
had a vision. Cool means that
successful disafﬁliation has been
accomplished.

The Beats are also character-
ized by certain kicks. These include
sex, narcotics, and Zen Buddhism.
They are solely keepers of them-
selves and are possessed with
what Culver called a “horrifying
self-absorption.” -

One of their “cool” authors is'
Marcel Proust, author of “Re-
membrance of Things Past.”

However, theirs is a superﬁcial
appreciation.

A typical conversation may run
something like this: One man may
say to another, “Do you dig
Proust?” The other says that he
does. The subject is closed and
as'Culver says it may cloak a
world of ignorance.

Perhaps the final kick is insan-
ity. But the beats do not realize
that “schizoprhenia does not equal
genius.” Socrates, Plato, and
Rembrandt have all been included
in the pernicious realm of sanity.

‘Thus the beats are all con-

forming in a different way than
the gray ﬂannel suit method.
This generation seems to con-
fuse “eccentricity .with individ-
uality;” They are obviously not
the same.

Finally, Culver came to this

conclusion; if the Beats would do
something that would give them
pleasure instead of merely show-
ing contempt for materialistic so-
ciety, their contribution would be
far greater.
_ Instead of their becoming cool
with marijuana, perhaps they
could have real visoins of beauty
and truth from something like
reading great poetry.

It is true ‘that the Beats are
showing symptoms of a diseased
society. Some of the things against
which they are revolting are real
and vital problems. We can only
criticize the immature, childish
manner in which they chose to
show their disapproval.

University’s plan. On the con-
trary, the Cllal'lC€llUI"S proposal to
buy Forbes Field arose only after
the eventual construction of a
municipal stadium on the North
Side became apparent. It is the
new stadium that will result in
the demise of Forbes Field. ‘

Williams submitted his proposal
together with a blueprint to the
Chamber of Commerce, the Uni-
versity, and Joe L. Brown, of the
Pittsburgh Pirates.

This plan does not call for the
rerouting of Forbes Ave. but in-
stead would depress it. The
present site of Bigelow Blvd. be-
tween Forbes and Fifth would
serve as a raised viaduct for the
campus.

A new part of Bigelow would
cut off the corner of the Cathedral
lawn at Forbes and Belleﬁeld, and
the latter street would serve as
a connecting point between
Forbes, Fifth, and the upper sec-
tion of Bigelow.

John Katsur, executive director
of the Chamber, said that the as-
sociation was not taking a stand
against the University’s expansion
plans, but that the losing of the
baseball field would be a severe
set-back to the_ community.

According to the blueprint,
parking space for the 70,000 to
80,000-seat stadium would be
provided by avparking garage
over the B&O Railroad lines
which pass through Panther
Hollow beneath the proposed
stadium site.

It is over the parking issue that
Martin and Katsur differ. The
parking garage as planned would
have to accommodate 12-15 thou-
sand cars,_ making it the largest
in the world ($37.5 million)

“The proposal would continue
to perpetuate the parking and
traffic problems in the Oakland
area, not solve it,” Martin claims.

The blueprint now calls for
two entrances and two exits.
“At that rate,” Martin added,
“it would take two hours to get
the cars out of the area.”

However, Katsur commented,
“There is a vast area of land in
the Hollow that would not involve
big costs, and furthermore, with
the stadium here, traffic could
easily move over the parkways
and other fringe roads, keeping
congestion to a minimum.”

A ANYONE FoR FOOTEALL?

When Pancho Sigafoos, sophomore, pale and _sensitive, first saw
Willa Ludowic, fresl1m_a.n, lithe as a hazel wand and rosy as the
dawn, he hemmed not; neither did he how. “I adore you,” he
said without preliminary.
“Thanks, hey,” said Willa, ﬂinging her apron over her face
modestly. “What position do you play?” ,
“Posit.ion?’—’ said Pancho, looking at her askancc. (The
_ askance is a ligament just behind the ear.)
.“On the football team,” said Willa.

“Football !” sneered Pancho, his young lip curling. “Football
is violence, and violence is the death of the mind. I am not a
football player. I am a poet!”

.“So long, buster,” "said Willa.
.“Wait!” cried Pancho, clutching her damask forearm.

She’ placed a. foot on--his pelvis and wrenched herself ‘free.
"I only go with football players,” she said, and walked, shimmer-
ing, into the gathering dusk. I

Pancho went to his room and lit a cigarette and pondered his
dread dilemma. What kind of cigarette did Pancho light? Why,
Philip Morris, of corris! _

Philip Morris isalways welcome, but never more than when
you are sore beset, When a fellow needsa friend, when the heart
is dull and the blood runs like sorghum, then, then above all,

is the time for the mildness, the serenity, that only Philip Morris’
1 can ‘supply. , . L ‘
' Pancho Sigafoos, his broken psyche welded, his fevered brow’
cooled, his synapses restored, after smoking a ﬁne Philip Morris, _

came to a decision. Though he was a bit small for football (an

even four feet) and somewhat overweight (427 pounds), he tried‘

out for the tea.m—-and tried out with suchgrit‘ and gumption
that he made it. ‘

Pancho’s college opened the season against the Manliattan
School of Mines, always a mettlesomc foe, but strengthened
this year by four exchange students from Gibraltar who had been
suoklcd by she-apes. By the middle of the second quarter the
Miners had wrought such havoc upon’ Pa.ncho’s team that there
was nobody left on the bench but Pancho. And when the
quarterback was sent to the infirma.ry— with his head driven
straight down into his esophagus, the coach had no choice but
to put Pancho in. ' V '

Pancho’s teammates were not conspicuously cheered as the
little fellow took his place in the huddle. '

“Gentleman,” said Pancho, “some of you may regard poetry

.as sissy stuff, but now in our most trying hour, let us hark to

these words from Paradise Lost: ‘All is not lost; the uncon-
. querable will and study of_ revenge, immortal hate, and courage
never to submit or yield!’ .’.’ ‘
So stirred was Pancho’s team by this ﬁery exhortation that
they threw themselves into the fray with utter abandon. As

. a consequence, the entire squad was hospitalized before the half.

The college was forced to drop football. Willa Ludowic, not
having any football players to choose from, took up with Pancho

and soon discovered the beauty of his soul. Today they are seen _

everywhere——dancing, holding hands, nuzzling, smoking.

Kaliden’s Run
. Gives Panthers

22.9-26 Victory

By LARRY HAGGERTY

“Notre_Dame may have the
~ luck of the Irish, but we have
the ﬁght of the.Panthers” was
the chorus ringing out in the
Blue and Gold dressing room
following 1 a s t Saturday’s
thrilling last minute 29-26 win
over Terry Brennan’s Notre Dame

squad. .
With eleven seconds remaining

. in the game, the Panthers had a

fourth down and goal-to-go situa-
tion on the Notre Dame five—yard
line. Quarterback Bill Kaliden
then made himself the “toast of the
‘whole Pittsburgh football area.”
Kaliden, behind beautiful block-
ing raced ﬁve yards around right
end to score the game—winning

touchdown after it had appeared"

that the Jungle Cats were doomed

to go down to their second con-

secutive defeat‘. .

“It was the most perfectly

executed play of the whole
game,” muttered a ’ dejected
Brennan in the Irish dressing

. room after the high-scoring af-
fair had terminated. “It had
to be a desperation play too,”
he continued. ’

Kaliden just did make the flag
though on his game-saving jaunt
The key blocks on the play were
thrown by Fullback Jim Cunning-
ham and End Ron Delfine.

“Cunningham hit Nick Pietro-
sante with a bone—crushing block
that put the Irish fullback on his
face while Delfine hit the tackle
that was drifting over towards the
corner. John Guzik also chipped in
when he chopped the end out of
the play,” announced a happy Jack
Wiley, the Panthers’ line ‘coach.

The Jungle cats surprised the
crowd of 55,330 when they took
a 15-0 lead midway through the
second quarter. Guzik recovered
a George Izo fumble‘ on the
Notre Dame‘ one to set up the

The frosh tallied two touch-

18 points. Ed Clark, who started
at quarterback for the ﬁrst time,

Tunisian Editors Visit University

Country Continues
Refusal To Join
Nasser Republic

“Although Tunisia is by no
means against the United
Arab Republic, it refuses to
join until the values and
aims 'of the Republic equal
those of the United Natio'ns.”

Attesting to this fact are three
Tunisian journalists who
touring the United States by spe-
cial invitation of the U.S. State
Department.

At a recent interview the jour-

nalists disclosed that Tunisia, a
North African country bordering
on the southern shores of the
Mediterranian Sea, now an inde-
pendent country, is enjoying its
full freedom after many years of
French Colonial control. ,
' A thirst for equality is obvi-
ously more than a desire with
the Tunisians for they have in-
corporated the equal represen-
tation idea into their very con-
stitution.

“Our assembly is elected by the
direct vote of the people. The as-
sembly in turn votes for the Pres-
ident,” said the Moslem editor of
the “Depeche Tunisienne” and
Dean of Journalism,  Nac-
eur Djellouli,

Pro—Western attitudes can be
seen in the similarity between the
Tunisian Constitution and the
first draft of the United States
Constitution. “The President shall
be elected by the legislature.”

When Yvan Chemla, Jewish
editor of the “La Presse de Tun-
isie," was asked if there was
any dissention between the ‘Jews
and Arabs, he aptly replied,
“There is no dissention between
the, different sects that make up
Tunisia.

“The Jews and Arabs live in
peace. In fact, two Jews have been
elected to the Government Assem-
bly by Arabs.” Women are not be-
ing ignored in the l§ountry’s cul-
tural improvement program. The
women, by a recent proclamation,
have been given equal ‘voting
rights. ~

“Why just before I left my
country, my wife went to the polls
to vote,” smiled Naceur Djellouli.

Radwan Foudhaily, Moslem ed-

itor ofthe As-Sabah, an Arabic

newspaper, disclosed’ that the

Tunisian women are learning

advanced and modern methods

in every ﬁeld from household
chores to education through an
organization known as the “As-
sociation of Women of Tunisia.”

He also said that many Tunis-
ian women are even active in gov-
ernment affairs.

On the whole the country of
Tunisia, from the assertions of
the three Journalists, is being
motivated by a growing demo-
cratic spirit that can be seen not
only in the hearts and minds of
the people, but in every phase of
their cultural life.
