FRIDAY, NOV. 22, ‘I974

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

In the first campus forum to
discuss whether Pitt's faculty
should unionize for collective
bargaining purposes, four panelists
debated their views before approx-'
imately 80 persons Wednesday

night in the Graduate School of

Public Health Auditorium.
The purpose of the forum was not

to debate the merits of any of the -
zugkofaculty organizations presently
 seeking to become bargaining

agent for the faculty. Rather it was
the first time, with the exception of
a Pitt News editorial, the major
issues of faculty unionization were
brought to public light.
Advocating faculty efforts to
officially organize were David
Bramhall, professor of economics,

4%,, 3‘) and Stephanie Brooks, a member of

the Young Socialist Alliance who is
the only student panelist. On the
negative, political science profes-
sor Richard Cottom spoke out
against the need to unionize, and
was supported by Assistant Vice-
Chancellor of Business and Finance
John Vrana. .

The speakers initially spoke for 12

k?"}:I~«;ninutes, and after a question-

answer period which lasted about
an hour, each wrapped up with a
three minute summary.’

The ‘arguments on both sides
seemed characterized depending
on the particular attitude towards
the administration and the univer-
sity community. Bramhall and
Brooks, for instance, viewed if the
administration and the University
as I a corporate structure with
corporate interests --
negative sense of the word -- and
believed the faculty and admini-

'j'.. _ stration shared a basic worker--

employer relationship.

But Cottom and Vrana thought a
collegial atmosphere existed, with
faculty, administration and stu-
dents partners in the learning
process.

Bramhall, leading off the discus-
sion, brought out fundamental
reasons why there should be

. faculty union. They included: 1) to

have the ability to bargain for
decent wages, particularly in light
of the declining economy, 2) to
insure teachers have an appropri-
ate work load, where they are not

burdened,. 3) to have a better

position in bargaining for job
security (tenure), 4) to have greater
central authority over the education

BY HARRIS LEVI

Noted feminist Germaine Greer
spoke of “population control as the
new fascism" in a Thursday night
Speech at Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial Hall.

Greer, famous for her 1970 book,
The Female Eunuch, blasted
current population control efforts
funded by wealthy countries as
attempts _ “to cover up the
consequences of our own mis-
takes” which were intended “to
destroy the stake of those we
regard as. aliens in the future.”

She likened advocation of an
overpopulation crisis “in which all
kinds of emergency measures, are
taken” to “the warfare threats
used by governments to limit
liberties ot citizens." Greer cited
United States‘ fear of a “commun-
ist threat" as an analogous
example.

“We’re now in a similar situation

population. Population control is

Pitt Implementing Tactics

BY PETE BUTCH
Pitt has implemented the first in
a series of contingency plans to
conserve coal during the current
,coal strike. This ﬁrststep, detailed

 - by Hunt Martin, director of Pitt’s
» Physical

Plant, calls for the
Belleﬁeld steam plant to burn as
much natural gas as possible to
create steam without using coal.

“The Bellefield steam plant,
where Pitt gets steam'for heat, is
mostly coal fired and partly gas
fired,” said Martin. “They have
about 60 carloads of coal in stock,
which is enough for 90 days.
However, on the warmer days
there is less of a demand for steam
and it can be produced by burning
only gas. On colder days, like today
[Thursday] some coal must be
burned to produce the steam in
demand.”

Martin said that the 90 day supply
depends on average weather. If
warmer, the coal will last longer,
colder it will go sooner.

“The idea of burning mostly gas
is usually not done since gas is not
our‘least expensive fuel. But we’re
spending the money to conserve
our coal supply."

iproviding impecunious candidates
{with resources to run for a position.
i The SG Elections Committee
‘invited any ideas for or against
"such funding of elections, as well
as specific suggestions as to how
‘this financing might be carried out.
Speaking in favor of the proposal
was SG Board member Bruce
Keeler, who expressed his views
from personal convictions rather
"than within any official capacity.
Keeler pointed out that the
purpose of using student activities
"fees to fund SG elections would "be
to “enable candidates without
ﬁnancial capabilities to have an
‘equal opportunity in running for
«elective office, and to eliminate the
_large contributions which make
candidates beholden to special
interest groups.”
, However, he stressed that the
purpose of public financing is not to
“limit the capabilities of a
 candidate’s creativity or to mani-
P pulate all aspects of the campaigns
V of candidates.”
Keeler suggested a rebate system
_ by which candidates who provide
‘complete receipts of their expen-
ses, could receive up to a $20

, over. This, he maintained, would
 allow students who could not
‘ ‘ otherwise afford the costs of

campaigning, the ﬁnancial help
__  » necessary to conduct a reasonable
 Lcampaign. .
' Keeler further proposed a ceiling
; of $50 in total expenditures be
 leveled on all candidates, ensuring

that no person would have an
unfair advantage over his oppon-
ents because of financial status.

Doug Yauger, President of Pitt’s
College Young Republicans, also
speaking only for himself, asserted
that using activities fees to fund
elections would be “like robbing
the blind,” and would also be
ineffective in curtailing abuse of
the campaign process.

“If funds are taken from the
student activities fee, you are
taxing the whole student body. It
forces an individual to pay for
candidates he might not approve
of,” he said.

Yauger substantiated this claim
by noting that most of the student
body does not even participate in
the SG election. “Last year only
2,284 of 12,800 students voted.”
Extracting funds from this.,large
group of nonvoters, he said, was
“taking money from people who
aren’t going to benefit from it.”

More importantly, Yauger felt,
such measures would accomplish
little in curbing excess spending in
elections. ‘‘I don’t think limiting a
person in this way will stop people
from spending more. What’s to
stop an individual from supple-
menting what the SG gives him? It
would just cause spending rates to
go higher and higher.” \

The Student Government Elec-
tions Committee took an impartial
stance in hearing the suggestions
of these students, and will discuss
the matter, taking these proposals
into consideration. ’

After the Committee votes on the
question of ‘public funding for
elections on Monday, the proposal
faces further approval by SG
Judicial Board. A

ulation were lambasted by Greer as
the fears of people surrounded by
aliens they didn’t understand.

“The fact that there’s not enough’

food is not caused by excessive
procreation.”

Greer chastized those who judge‘

foreign standards of living in terms
of their own. “Some people
probably thought that the popula-
tion of BanglaDesh wasn't being
fed properly because they didn’t
eat hamburgers."

According to Greer, if the US and
other major food-producing nations
were serious about sharing a food
surplus, “they wouldn’t produce a
surplus in the grains that they do.
They’d produce it in grains that
others eat.” _She noted that 16% of
the world population uses 75% of
the resources. “It’s not the
‘overpopulated’ countries that are
using up the resources,” she said.

Greer noted the relevance of
population control to feminism.
“Regarding fertility, the rights of
women have never been recognized
as we’ve gone for compulsory
child’-bearing for husbands to
compulsory sterility for the state.”

She suggested that “no forced
sterilization” would become an
important rallying cry in the near
future.” There was a time when
there was not talk of enforced
sterilization. Now the same things
that were called, wicked, unlawful
and wrong are being forced upon
us.”

For Greer, the enforced preven-

tion of child-bearing has begun in
America’ as well as other countries.
“If you haven't had children, you'll
find it extremely difficult to get
sterilized.”

She commented on Dr. William.

Shockley’s proposal of offering
cash incentives to blacks to
encourage sterilization. “Half-
educated scientists bid to become
some of the world's worst tyrants.
Children are considered as an
investment in terms of their cost to
the state. The poverty of certain
groups is being exploited to
deprive them of their stake in the
future. 0 ..
“The blueprint of Fascism is the
‘ army,” Greer said as she compared

the army’s abandonment of the
individual’s right of choice to the
practices of the American Medical.
Association (AMA) and hospitals.

“In this country of the hard sell,

"there’s a point when giving of.

information and persuasion stops
and bullying begins.” Greer said
women who have just given birth
are pressurized into being steri-
lized. “Feminists will be more
active in the future,” Greer
forecasts. “It’s hard to track these
things down but the price of liberty

. is eternal vigilance.”

She analyzed influences on other
forms of birth control: “The church
and the laws have increased
suffering by adding guilt and
despair to the load for women who
fall from grace in their own eyes,”
she said. regarding abortion.
“Women have been ‘carrying the
can’ for male dominated contra-

ceptive production.”

“The pill has been hailed as the
perfect contraceptive because of
the demand for an easier way.
Birth control methods won’t be
used until there’s a. demand for
them.” Greer said. I

and had a savings in energy.

“We've also reduced our demand‘

for steam, which means Bellefield
can keep less boilers in operation.
By the old method we would start
heating all buildings at the same
time creating a tremendous de‘-
mand for steam at one time, while
at other times there would be little
demand at all.

“Now we start heating some
buildings a little earlier, some a
little_ later and we/use less boilers
for a little longer. This is

?'~i;‘\economical for it takes energy to
prepare a boiler and to keep‘ it
ready to produce steam. So we
have less boilers to maintain at a
‘standby’ state.” >
Martin also outlined tentative
plans’ to lower temperatures in
buildings, close_down some _build-
ings partially or completely, or
reduce the hours in some build-
ings. But Martin emphasized that
no buildings had been singled out
and no definite plans have been

GPSA Studies Fee Decrease

The Graduate and Professional
Students Association (GPSA) con-
sidered decreasing its share of the
graduate activity fee by 40% at its
meeting last night. The move
would eliminate the free Xeroxing
service which interim chairperson
Nick Axten called “a heavy drain
on the GPSA resources.” The
GPSA presently has a 55% share of
the $2 per term graduate activity
fee.

Axten went on to show that a‘

nominal charge of 2-2 % cents per
copy would “subsidize the services
and eliminate the $800-900 losses
suffered every month due to the
free copying service.”

The question of adequate cover-
age of graduate events by the Pitt
News was also discussed. Georgh

Blank of the GPSIA said,‘ “News
coverage by the Pitt News is highly
undergrad oriented. Perhaps they
need to change policy.”

In other business, Axten des-
cribed the Health Insurance situa-
tion as “deplorable. No media has
attempted to portray the true
picture.”- Blank wanted represen-
tation on the Health committee and
expressed the general sentiment

when he said, “This is a matter
which affects us all.”

Advisor Lou McClinden said,
“The GPSA should be allowed to
evolve. Let’s see what has to be
done and then decide how to do it.”

General consensus at the meeting
was to~make GPSA more effective
as the voice of the graduates. As
Axten put it, “Let’s have more
communication--from both sides."

Early Bowl Invitations

’_j It is truly amazing that the Pitt Panther football squad, known for its
_, pride and enthusiasm, has not been invited to a national bowl game.
The Panthers already have improved on last year’s record of 6-4-1
which garnered an invitation to the Fiesta Bowl, a minor bowl bid. The
~ team has proven its ability throughout the season, compiling a record
‘_ so far of 7-3 with. only Penn State left on the schedule.
The Panthers came very close just last weekend to defeating fourth
' ranked Notre Dame. And yet, the Panthers have not been invited to a
bowl deserving of their stature. The team, however, still is under
 consideration at last report for the Tangerine Bowl, yet chances seem
‘ slight the circumstances which must lead to Pitt’s invitation will ever
. occur. -
" But, the case of the Panthers is only a symptom of the idiocy of the
bowl system. Pitt would have been a good ticket‘ seller for most bowls,
_ since it is privileged to have such a capable and nationally known and
. respected coach as Johnny Majors. And rlmning back Tony Dorsett,
«though plagued somewhat with injuries, has succeeded once again this
year in being the spark of the Panther offense. .
Quite clearly bowl omcials acted too swiftly in ﬁlling slots for their
 football classics. Perhaps, one of the best examples of the
1 idiocy of this year’s bowl lmtch ups is the invitation of Penn State to
the Cotton Bowl. Penn State has been defeated by Navy and
. North Carolina, which is proof that Penn State no_ longer reigns
- supreme in the East. _

are raising the cost of our utility
bill—th-is is what we are led to
believe. Can we seriously place the
blame on the miners for the
economy which is falling down on
top of our head? In the automobile
industry, for example, workers are

being laid off at a quickening pace. _

The same is true in construction.
These problems, as well as pro-
blems of antiquated plants, are
responsible for much of the layoffs
in steel—we see some mills ‘laying
off workers, while others_are going
full blast—"but the wire services,"
carried by the Pitt Newsblame the
miners.

Can we blame miners for the mine
owner’s reluctance to meet- the
needs of the miners? In the last
year, coal prices have gone up’
61%; the profits of the 10 largest
coal companies rose an incredible
181%; the buying power of the
miners has fallen 4% in the same
year. It is, and has been, in the
power of the coal companies (many
of which are owned by the steel
companies themselves, as well as
by the oil monopolies and the
metal-mining monopolies, and a
few independents) to grant the

Letters tothe Editor  

  UN Dinner_ -
Misrepresented

Dear Mr. MacLeod:

The article of November 13 by
Mohammed Sidky referring to" the
United Nations Association Diner
of October 4 prompts me to make
the following observations.

I am sorry that Mr. Sidky was
offended by the fact that an
evening ‘meal was the occasion for
discussion the problems of “World
Hunger.” A dinner was held by
our association each October to
commemorate United Nations
Month. It is a primary means by
which we communicate with the
Pittsburgh Community on topics of
universal importance. As usual,
the dinner was very well attended
and the general topic was vigor-
ously and candidly discussed.
Certainly the menu was not extra-
vagant, and, if a dinner devoted to
hunger seems incongrous it was
not so under these circumstances.

The general tenor of Mr. Mair’s

remarks have been misrepresented '

by Mr. Sidky. Mr. Mair was
invited to speak because of his
position as Advisor to the US
Delegation to the United Nations
Food Conference in Rome. His

speech concentrated upon the ‘pro- ‘

blems of that Conference rather
than, as Mr. Sidky implies, United
States foreign policy. Mr. Mair did
advocate that third world countries
should concentrate more upon agr-
iculture than they have in the
immediate past. I believe that
there is a consensus on the need for
such concentration. To blame the
. United ‘States for the emphasis

miners’ demands immediately,
with no rise in prices, in spite of (or
because of) the inﬂation and layoffs
that are hurting us all. If the price
of coal is raised anyway, it will .be
because, as Lou Antal (president,
Distric 5, UMW) is quoted in the
Nov. 25 TIME (p. 27-8), “Every
time in the past when they’ve given
(the miners) two bucks,‘ they raised
the price of coal by threeﬂ,’ We can
not allow the media, including the
Pitt News to make it seem as if the
miners are ﬁghting against us,
competing with us.

The same anti-union argument
has appeared in these pages op-
posing the right of professionals on
the Pitt campus to organize, to
fight for better pay and working
conditions. The argument runs
that this union is somehow against
our interests. is it the profession-
als‘ rights that are against’ our
interests, or is it the refusal of the
administration to recognize these

rights that damages the_“academic '

community?”
The same defense holds true for
the miners’ rights, which are more

‘icallously and dangerously ignored

by the operators. Can anyone
argue that it is in our interests to
have 100,000 miners killed since
1900, one dead miner every other
working day of 1974, 39 dead since
the contract talks began? It is in
our interests to have the coal
owners make huge profits by
charging us more and more, and
giving the miners, subject to the

which developing countries» have
placed upon industry is a gross
oversimpliﬁcation.

Very truly yours,

Professor Cornelius.F. Murphy, Jr.

PTU Says It's
Not Defunct

Dear Editor:

In a recent editorial regardingethe
Homecoming Student Leadership
Dinner, Tom Smith made the
statement that the Pitt Tenant
Union is a “practically defunct”
student government organization.
Therefore, he could not understand
why the chairman of the committee
was invited to the dinner.

We, of Pitt Tenant Union, feel"
that Tom Smith has made a

most dangerous and unhealthy
working conditions in the country,
only $150 a month pension, low
pay, no sick pay, few holidays, a
speeded-up and more dangerous
working day? Can we expect
President Ford’s government to
defend the miners’ rights. No. We
have 'to support the right of
working people to use their own
organizations and their‘ own

‘ strength to fight against the infla--

tion, the huge proﬁts, the reces-
sion, the death in the mines. In a
very real sense, their fight is our
fight. '

protest the picture so far presented
in this ‘newspaper, in the wire
services, etc., of the ‘coal miners’
strike. We must support their
demands for safety, for democracy

in the mines, against racial and

sexual discrimination in the mines,
and against the inﬂation that
cripples us all. For all these
reasons, we must oppose any
attempt to make it seem as if it will
be in our interest to have the
federal or state government use
Taft-Hartley injunctions, or mili-‘
tary troops, .or any coercive mea-

sures that will interfeie withthe

miners’ right to fight for their

"legitimate demands, against the

power of a few monopolies, in all
our interests.

mistake. Our. organization is not
defunct; in fact, far from it.
Obviously, ‘Smith did not even
"bother to investigate the status of
the organization prior tq writing the
editorial. This negligence is a
ﬂagrant disregard for journalistic
principles, and is absolutely
inexcusable. --

The_ Pitt Tenant Union has been

effectively aiding University stu-
dents with their off-campus hous-
ing problems. Since the beginning
of -this term, PTU has helped
students inover two hundred and
ﬁfty cases, ranging from landlord-
tenant problems to small claims
-co\urt procedures. '

With one sweep of his pen Tom
Smith has made the actively
successful Pitt Tenant Union out to
be a practically defunct organiza-
tion. We deplore this propensity for
irresponsible journalism.

a faculty union_which could have
great lobbying power in Harris-
burg.

He quoted the recent Pitt News
editorial which did not support the
unionization efforts, and disagreed
with a section which read, “Pitt
faculty are not iyrannized labor-
ers.”

“Anyone who has been around
here very long and had dealings
with the administration would

know that this was just not true,” I
57. }~B.ramhall said. Analogizing the

University to a corporation, he
added, “Sure, this is a non-profit
corporation,‘ but so was the
Committee to Re-elect the Presi-
dent." V ' /

Vrana, who became the first
member of the Pitt administration
to put~his views on the public
record, feltlthe atmosphere at Pitt
was collegial, and very free, with

- an emphasis on informality. He
|believed.a faculty union would

begin tearing apart this atmo-

sphere.

William Kunstler, civil liberties

attorney and spokesman for minor- '

ity interests will speak at Benedum
Hall Auditorium Monday Night.

Kunstler, noted for his early
attacks, on what he called the
“immorality” of the Nixon Admin-

 ,/Frstration is currently Defense

Lawyer for the Attica Brothers
Defense and will present the film
“Attica” at the eight pm lecture.

Kunstler, 52, has a long record of

“At this point, the decision
making‘ of educational policy is
shared,” Vrana said. “Faculty,
students, and administrators par-
ticipate on the faculty senate. and
its respective committees. But in
collective bargaining,” he added,
“there is a formal, legal relation-
ship. And it is a two party
relationship -- between the em-
ployer and the employee. This is
bound to leave the students out.”

Raising issues that “would
concern me as a student," Vrana
questioned what would happen to
the students’ role in the university
governance system if collective
bargaining were voted at Pitt.'He
was also concerned that possible
involvement by the courts and
labor arbiters at Pitt in case of
disputes would seriously hinder the
academic world on campus.

Vrana also raised the possibility of
the “professionals sanction, -- the
strike.

“Here you are going to have the
educational process interrupted,
with lost time, and the necessity to

black leaders as Stokely Car-
michael, Adam Clayton Powell,
and H. Rap Brown. ‘ '

He defended Daniel Berrigan and
eight other Roman Catholics
against charges of destroying draft
records and he was the chief
attorney in the Chicago Seven trial.
Kunstler was also involved in the
negotiations during the Wounded
Knee takeover.

dinated by Alternative Curriculum,

have academic calendars revised,”
he said.

Brooks spoke next and listed
several deficiencies in the univer-

-sity structure and process which

could possibly be eliminated by a A
faculty union. ‘

She viewed the University as a
“corporation by law and practice,”
condemning Pitt’s Board of \Trus-
tees as a group of men who
represent the industrial and cor-
porate interests of the communi-
ty. “This has nothing to do with
quality of education,” she added. '

Additionally, Brooks pointed to
the School of Education where the I
dean recently instructed the
teachers to account for all their
teaching time on special forms.
“This is just another example,”
Brooks said, “that the University
emphasizes productivity over qual-
ity education.

“And the University presently has
no adequate grievance procedure,”
she continued, citing the cases of
medical school professor Sharon
Johnson, who in a noted case was
allegedly denied tenure because of
her sex. Brooks also mentioned the
controversial ease of Curtiss
Porter, a professor who seeks the
chair of the black studies depart-
ment, but will not be appointed by
administrators despite vocal sup-
port by students.

“For these reasons,”’ Brooks

"concluded/‘we as students should

support the faculty’s goals today, I

for they are our goals tomorrow.” '

Finally, Professor Cottom warned
that a faculty union would begin to
erode the creative atmosphere of -

-discovery that characterizes uni- .

versities. .

‘.§We can not afford to be»
routinized,” he said, referring to
the faculty. “We can not be

creative in a bureaucratic model.”
Cottom expressed the fear if a
union, were voted, quality faculty
members would not want to be Pitt
faculty, and therefore the quality of
education would drop.

But Cottom was not satisfied with
the present conditions at Pitt, and
was quick to blame his collegues in
the faculty for the problems. He did
not think the tenure system worked
well, and he put most of the blame

on a faculty which has not involved ’

itself intensely in the University’s
governance process, “This shows
they just aren't interested in the

University of Pittsburgh,” Cottom

said.

‘He added, however, that a faculty
union was not the solution, but
rather an increased activism on the
part of the faculty in Pitt’s decision
making process. Cottom said that

structure at present is satisfactory ‘~

but, all that is needed is" a faculty
willing to work within it.

Efforts to unionize Pitt faculty
began in March 1973 when the Pitt
Professional Union (PPU) began

.I_‘.

soliciting “authorization eards.i"
from faculty members who de-if

clared they would be interested in‘

having a union represent them-..i

Since then, ﬁve other faculty

unionization process.

Pennsylvania Labor Relation-s,-E

Pitt. Then the Board will determine,

which groups of faculty and otherjé

An election of employees in the
to-be-designated unit could come

as early as fall term,1975, when 

Pitt faculty would have a chance to

elect one of the agents vying. to:

BY BILL MOORE

 “Oh! This is so groovy.” The
 woman speaking is 22 or'so, she

has long," black hair and is wearing
Nothing else,
just purple sunglasses.

Ah unattractive male, similarly

 unclothed, is busy attacking her

more intimate parts. The two met
at a black mass, following the

- group rape of a young virgin by the

mass participants, and it has been

_ one sex act after another for the

happly couple ever since.

Flicks like “Switchcraft” abound
in the Liberty Avenue movie the-
aters, but few people ever get the
chance to see them. The average
person is afraid to venture down to

A. “the fleshpots of Pittsburgh” be-

cause they’re not sure what really
happens on Liberty Avenue.

But the best antidote for fear is
understanding. If the masses knew

, what to expect behind the ﬂashing

‘ “Art Cinema” signs, they wouldn’t
need to fear visiting these theaters.
So, in’ order to clear up the
unhealthy mystery, here is the Pitt

, News Guide to Liberty Avenue.:

FEATURE FILMS

Liberty Avenue is lined with adult
ﬁlms shown in the back of various
magazine‘ and book shops. Film
titles, sometimes the most enter-
taining aspect of the whole 'movie,

range from the vaguely suggest-
ive—“Switchcraft"—to the direct-
ly obscene—“Rings of Passion."
“Switchcraft” was the feature a
few weeks back at the Bizarre Art
Theatre. The plot is simple. Seven
people, both male and female, rape
a “young virgin,” tell her she
handles herself well, and then split
into pairs (or triads) and retire to
separate rooms to begin attacking
each other. The ending is up to you
to find out, for’ various reasons I
didn’t stay that long.
“Switchcraft” is shown in a
medium-sized viewing room in the
back of the Bizarre Art Theatre.
The seats are clean and comfort-
able and the floors are cleaner than
most since no popcorn is sold.

aisles offering anyone erotic plea-
sure. Chances are good that, if you
do go to see an adult movie, you’ll
never know there is anything out of
the ordinary about the theater until
you look up at the screen.

The front of the Bizarre Art
Theater is also interesting. Direct-
ly inside the front door, enclosed in
a glass case like the type they use
at Gimbels, is the nicest collection
of leather accessories around. I’m
not sure exactly what some of these
contraptions are used for, but they
are all made with nice leather and
are all well stitched.

Further back in the store is the
magazine and book section. Think
of an obscene word—it is probably
the title of one of these adult books.

Prices range from 50 cents for a
pornographist newspaper, to a few
bucks for the pictorial history of
various perversions., '

The movies, by the way, cost
about $4.50, but many theaters
allow escorted women in free.
Bizarre Art Theatre, and I presume
most of the others, gives everyone
a neat little “National Adult Movie
Club” membership card. The card
attests to the fact that you realize
the movies you are about. to see
“exhibit all forms of human sex-
uality” and that the holder of the
card is not “a police officer, vice
squad member, nor the member of
any other law enforcement agency
on official business.”

You may also be asked to sign a
form attesting to both of these
facts, but don’t bother to sign your
real name because no one checks
ID’s. A

PEEP_ snows

After the movies you might want
to pay a visit to one of the
numerous short features shown on
Liberty Avenue. Two types of peep
shows are prevalent—the binocular
type and the booth type. The
booths are probably the best buy
since you can cram as many as five,
people in for the same quarter,
while only one person can see into
the binocular-type at a time.

The short features are essentially
the same as the full-length features

I only shorter.‘ The one difference is

that the close-ups tend to be a little
closer. Watch yourself if you go to
see these peep shows, because
they use the old. trick of_ ending
halfway through the action, and it
will cost you an extra quarter or two

if you want to know how they end.

Once again, the titles of the short
films are‘ the best‘ thing about
them. The best title I saw was
“Whip me, Baby” at the Pent-
house Burlesk. ,

There is an all-male peep show
section at the Roman V massage
parlor. I didn't see them, but odds
are they are the same as the rest
except for the lack of females. The
Roman V charges
admission fee in addition to the
quarter payed for each film. The
Penthouse Burlesk has no extra
admission fee. A

SEXUAL AIDS
Various. contraptions aimed at
increasing your sexual ability or
enjoyment are available at many

_stores along Liberty Avenue for

those who are interested.‘

MASSAGE PARLORS

There are many massage parlors

_in and around Liberty Avenue,

some classier than. others, but all
offering the same services. I
visited only one—The Roman V.
The Roman V.massage parlor is
located on the third floor, above the
peep shows. _ ‘V
A nice feature at the Roman V is
the small window provided to allow
prospective massage patrons to
look in at the masseuses on duty.
The window, about one foot
square, looks into a small, taste-
lessly decorated room. The night I

visited there were four masseuses

on duty.

“It’ll cost ya 20 dollahs or 30
dollahs," said one overweight,

answer to my query about prices.

a 25 cent-

STRIP JOINTS

Liberty Avenue, along with every-
thing else, has a fine array of
strippers. In case you don’t know,
what happens at these shows is
that someone rips, strips, peels or
drops his or her clothes and
The
better ones dance around a little.
The audience just stares.

Prices differ greatly. The Pent-
house Burlesk has a male strip
show for $6 and a female strip show
for $5, which must be discrimina-
tory against someone. Bars some-
times have "strippers for as little as
a $1 cover charge, but drinks
usually cost a bundle at these
places. ~~

PROSTITUTION

Liberty Avenue is also said to be
the center of activity for Pittsburgh
practicioners of the worlds oldest
profession—1adies, and men, of the
evening.

A friend tells me the best way to
contact prostitutes or pimps is to
stand by a Liberty Avenue phone
booth until it rings, answer it, ask

/.

whomever is on the other 

where the action is, and go. I tried“-‘ "9’

this and the phone never rang, so
this may be a mere fallacy.

The other method of contact is to
hand around back alleys looking for
fancy Cadillacs or Lincohis. This
sounds reasonable, but it is also an
easy way to get mugged. '

So that is what Liberty Avenue is
all about. Some nights my be
busier, and some ﬁlms may be

more obscene, but the essence is 

the same. -

One last thing, some people say
that pornography is cheap enter-
tainment. It isn’t cheap—l blew
$10 on this story. «Porno isn’t for
everyone. Many people ﬁnd it
boring, if not offensive. If you
can't stand the heat, keep out of
the kitchen, and stay away from

ORIGINS OF MARVEL COMICS,
by Stan Lee L

Simon & Schuster, New York
Paperback, $5.95, 254 pages

Beowulf is dead. So are Hercules,
St. George and John Kennedy.

Leaping into the -vacuum are the
heros of the comic book industry, '
who, even if weakened by green
kryptonité, are invulnerable to the
assassinations of our society.

The‘ last decade has seen the
arrival of comic books as a
recognizable force in fictional
literature. No other media besides
television has the same wide-
spread impact on Americans. You
might forget who Aaron Burr was,
or who Thomas Jefferson was, but.
characters like Spiderman and the -
Incredible Hulk are living elements
of heroism inside the mind.

Where did the comic book_

. characters come from?

Once born they developed from
children’s -entertainment to a
sophisticated level which appeals
to all ranges of intelligence and
philosophy.

In the year 8000, after the.
cockroaches have inherited the
earth, their’ archeologists will turn.
to comic books as social artifacts.

Every -recent phase of this
country, the jihad of_ the Second
World War, the paranoia of the
anti-communist era, the current
disillusionment with the traditional

I circlesjof power have all been

captured in the comic medium.
Theyare a consistent history of this
country and its people.

When black people finally “ar-
rived-” in our culture, they began
appearing in comic books. When
social concern was assimilated into
the fabric of America, Captain
America started living in Harlem as
a social worker.

surrealistic detachment of super-
heros from the real world was taken
in the 60’s. The barrier to their
acceptance’ by the reader was
broken. They became elements of
unparalleled intensity in fictional
literature. One of the mysteries of
the comic industry is its successful
competition with television, using

what is basically a reading media, a

non-kinetic visual expression.

Television, which cut so deeply
into fictional writing, into the
movie industry__and into theatre
arts, has been unable-to damage
the popularity of the good old comic
book.

Where did the super-heros come
from? In Origins of Marvel Comics,
Stan Lee, a Marvel editor, provides
an answer. ‘

Written in the same smart-ass
tone used in editorial writingiwithin
the actual comic magazines, Lee
doesn’t strike out on a metaphysi-
cal limb in his analysis. Hetalks

business.

The inspirations which lead to the
creation of characters like the Hulk
are sketchily presented. The artists
who were involved, the divine
revelations in back-rooms and the
pressures of making a hero come
alive for the reader are. all
described, briefly.

' Too briefly, maybe.

But Lee seems to have recognized
the book belongs to the super-heros
themselves and real-live-color-
original issues of each hero’s

‘ history are there to enjoy, with all

of the mistakes, and all of the
promise.

With a nod to_ the personal
development of the heros, Lee
includes a second, later issue [also
in it’s,entirety] to offer the reader a
sense of scope in the characters.
Lee obviously sensed what the

— The club members sang the final

practiced several other numbers.

Risers were set up in the L-shaped

heads of the men on the top row

Pitt basketball fans will have their
ﬁrst opportunity to get a look at the
1974-75 version of the Pitt Panther
basketball squad tomorrow night at
8 pm when the Cats hold their

annual Blue-Gold contest.
There are a few interesting
changes in the Pitt program the
most obvious of which will be
evident upon entering old Fitz-

 Improved Season

BY TOM HALL

The Varsity Swimming and Diving
Te/am opens its 1974-75 season
Saturday, November 30 at 2 pm
with a dual meet against Temple.
With all but one of last year’s
tankers returning, coaches Dick
Bradshaw and Al Coffey look
forward to another fine season..A

“I hate to be too overconfident,
but I expect this team to swim
competitively with anyone in the

East. We should improve on last '

year’s 7-3 record,” Coach Brad-
shaw stated.

And rightly so. In dual meets last
year, Pitt outpointed its oppo-
nents, 638-379.

Coach Bradshaw pointed out that
with the abundant talent this year,
A1 Coffey’s diving squad, “could
be'the .best in the East.”

Leading the Pitt attack will be
MVP John Schepner, who scored
74 points in dual competition last
year. Alsoretuming to the squad
is Mark Wallace, MVP of the

‘K 1972-73 season.

Pitt looks tofhave another fine
time this year. And as Bradshaw

be without the services of last
year’s leading scorers and re-
bounders, Billy Knigh and Mickey
Martin. Nevertheless, head coach
Buzz Ridl doesn’t foresee any
serious weaknesses in this year’s
squad. _

“We lost both our senior starting
forwards, Bill,Knight and Mickey
Martin, and they were our strength
last year,” said Ridl. “That’s a gib
void to fill. Scoring-wise, we
expect our guards Tom Richards,
Kirk Bruce" and Keith Starr to pick
up the offense. We’re not looking
for one man to step in and take over
Knight’s scoring; instead we’re
looking for overall improvement in
that department.

After last year’s great success,
Ridl is reluctant togchange the
‘Panthers’ style of play which left
’their opponents in a dazed condi-X
tion. Their running offense and
flowing amoeba defense enable the
Cats to win despite their lack of
height.

‘~‘We will maintain the quickness
and fast break which were so
helpful last year,” said Ridl. “And
we’ll use the same defense that
season.” ' i
' Tomorrow’s contest will be the
first opportunity for Pitt fans to get
a look of Ridl’s crop of recruits.

to add some rebounding strength
this season. Freshmen Larry

also add some excitement to to-
morrow’s contest. .

Besides Richards, Starr, and
Bruce, three other top Panthers
from last season will return to
acton. Lew Hill, Willie Kelly, and
Jim Bolla all return for another
season of valuable service. In
addition, Lucius Keese, who sat out
last season with a leg injury, will
also be in uniform tomorrow and it
is hopeful that his size (6-10)_will be
a valuable asset in the coming
months. i

The Pitt Football squad has its
own Rip Van Winkle in the person
of senior quarterback Bob Medwid,
who will start in place of the injured
Billy Daniels in the “Turkey Bowl"-
against Penn State next Thursday.
Remember Rip Van Winkle, the
leading character who manages to
fall asleep for twenty years, wakes
_up, returns to his village and finds
Tévervthinlg has changed? It takes a
While-..)f0l'\ the ' people to remember
him b1ft- he is recognized and
re-accepted.
Remember Bob Mepwid? He was
part of the quarterback triumvirate

pof Havern-Hogan-Medwid which
finished the lasii_y'ears of Carl

DePasqua”s footbalffiasco. During
that time Pitt was regalrded as one
of the 10 worst football teams in
the country.

‘ Times have changed for both Pitt
.and Bob Medwid. When DePasqua
was released after the ‘.72 season
things looked relatively good for
Medwid's senior year, thanks to a
new coach and a new ‘football
program. Instead came a two year
“sleep" period.

Last season Bill Daniels, then a
junior, managed to wrest the
starting QB job from Medwid. To
compound problems Medwid suf-
fered a knee injury. Thus it was
decided to bred-shirt him which
meant an added year of eligibility.

This season: Medwid's ﬁfth-‘at
Pitt, didn't seem to be progressing
well either as the former Sto Rox

.“Rip Van I Medwid” Set For Turkey Bowl

quarterback spent the year on the
sidelines hollering encouragement
to Billy Daniels. When Daniels was
injured against Notre Dame,
Medwid filled in admirably in the
tight loss.

Shaking off the Cobwebs will be
Medwid’s biggest problem against
Penn State, his first starting
assignment since the Pitt-Florida
State matchup of 1972.

The 1972 season doesn’t seem

long ago but to Bob Medwid and.

Pitt Football, the difference is
clearer than that of night and day.
The main change is the difference
in attitude between the old and the
present football programs.

“Back then, on the team bus
going to the Notre Dame game the
offensive linemen would say ‘Good
Luck!’ and then begin to laugh.”
explained Medwid. It seemed those
players knew what was coming and
didn’t really give a damn. Now the
emphasis of course is on ‘pride and
enthusiasm’.

Medwid's pride and enthusiasm
-were more than evident‘ in last
Saturday’s struggle in South Bend
as he did more than could be
expected for a quarterback in such
a situation. Yet he stated, “I’m[not
satisfied with the performance,”
citing room for improvement,
especially in passing accuracy.

The chance for improvement has
come in this week’s closed
practices. For the first-time in quite
a while Medwid has had the chance
to run the offense on every play

instead of every other, as had been
the case earlier in the season. The
reason of course is the ill-timed
knee injury which ended Billy
Daniel’s Pitt career a week earlier
than Billy had hoped.

“The practices are a little
different, you get a little more
personal attention and get a chance
to start working off the rust,” said
Medwid who is approaching the
Thanksgiving Day game with the
calm of a professional football
veteran. After all, he’s the old man
of the squad and the rest of the
players don’t let him forget it.
Medwid recently turned 22.

Coach Majors may or may not
know if Bob Medwid is old as far as

Back in the beginning of the
season, both Pitt’s Johnny Majors
and Penn State’s Joe Paterno cried
about the potential of their
respective team to such a degree
that if they had both been pointed
towards each other, they would

 

have flooded out Johnstown.

Now with the season down to the
wire and Pitt barely trailing the
-"‘-Q, Nittany Lions in the popular
Akopinion of most college football
“experts”, the crying has been
reduced to no more ‘than a

"supporters, possibly even __to the
point where the old, “well let’s
wait and see” attitude may have
set in.

Personally, I couldn’t blame
anybody for bailing out right now.
That’s not doubting Bob Medwid’s
ability" to show his stuff after two
years of what has to be dissatis-
fying bench warming. The odds
and percentages just don’t look as
good as they used to, that’s all.

Majors, like Medwid,. is merely a
victim of circumstance, since he
has no real choice in the matter.

Patemo is saying much about the
“Turkey Bowl” that will settle once
and for all just who is tops in the
East. ‘ _

The general acclamation by both
coaches regarding the upcoming
meeting is that the game will do
wonders for the credibility and
reputation of Eastern footba1l--
nothing more and nothing less.
The pre-game bullshit has re-
mained the traditional pre-game
bullshit.

Naturally the loss of Billy Daniels
has to dishearten quite a few Pitt ‘

Medwid, although he has seen very
little game action, (when was the

But Pitt has more going for it to
overshadow the switch at quarter-

the Lambert Trophy.

I keep looking back to the Penn
State games against Maryland and
North Carolina State, and a
particular remark made by one of
the officials from the Orange Bowl
Committee for the evaluation that
has Pitt topping the Nittany Lions.

Paterno_’s constant complaining at
the beginning of the season was not
without due cause. This is not a
banner year in State College. In
fact, that Orange Bowl representa-

But optimistically thinking,
Majors has had some pretty good
luck when it comes to relying on a
backup man this season. Bob

“We've sung the national anthem
at a few baseball games and on the
TV signoffs. Starting in October,
we went through a lot of channels,
I'm just disappointed that it didn’t
work out..Maybe next year."

Ritchie elaborated some of the
Club’s future plans which include a
tour in February which will stop at
Caldwell College and Mt. Holyoke.
“The home concert in April will
feature the second half which will

‘have songs from Sweet Charity,

Pippin and Minnie’s Boys. I’m
working with Doc and a choreo-
grapher...the numbers will be

Jstages, choreographed and cos-

tumed. We have a good-sized club
now but we’re constantly looking
for new people.”

“Those little side trips to the
breweries are nice,” interjected
Club member Dave Deely.

According to Ritchie and the other
members, “Doc” presents one
image at rehearsals and another
“on the outside.” “lt’s like we’re
getting voice lessons,” Ritchie
remarked, “Doc won’t let a song go
on stage if there’s the slightest
chance of a mistake. Personally
he’s become one of the club in a
remarkably short time. Both club
and director hope they’re together
for many more years.” He added
with a smile, “Eons upon Eons.”

“ ‘Doc’ always reminds us that
stage presence is important.
You’re supposed to smile. Well, at
one concert on the tour we were
tired..‘.we’d done 3 concerts the
day before—-and it was showing in
our faces. Out of nowhere ‘Doc’
flashed a nude pinup. The club
perked up."
