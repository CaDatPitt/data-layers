New YMCA President

Homer Wadsworth
ABINET MEMBER of the YMCA,

dent of the YMCA to succeed John B.
Holbrook, E34, who will be graduated
this June.

Wadsworth As
YMCA President

Pitt News Prediction Upheld As
Members Rush Election
At Easter Retreat

Homer C. Wadsworth, C35, will be,
as the Pitt News predicted, the presi-
dent of the YMCA for the coming
year. He was elected at the Easter
vacation retreatof the Cabinet at
Trinity Manor,

The motion for election of presi-
dent was made by John Holbrook,
E34, this year's president, in order
that discussion of the organization’s
activities be done by those persons
who would be in charge for the new
year,

This move was objected to by King
Derr, C35, on the grounds that proper
representation was lacking. Derr was
particularly concerned about “any one
going to feel as though they hadn’t
enough say in the matter” and that
several members of the cabinet and
committee of management couldn’t be
there. However Derr’s objections were
overridden and John P. Bracken, C34,
moved the election take place and was
seconded by Jack Kurtz, C35.

Upon passing of the motion for

elect \Vadsworth by acclamation. This
motion was immediately seconded and
passed.

Derr then said, “I have only one
objection to this election. The Pitt
News beat us in announcing our own
president.”

Earlier in the day the new presi-
dent and Bracken squabbled over the
decided liberal views taken by the
YMCA. Bracken contended that the
conservative side of questions wasn’t
given fair consideration, To prove
his point Bracken claimed that the
ibook rack in the YMCA hut was ﬁlled
‘with liberal books, pamphlets and
imagazines that gave only one side of
the picture, and there was no litera-
ture there to defend the conservative
issues.

Wadsworth contended that it was
Ionly the natural reaction to facts
fairly presented that made the fellows
in the YMCA liberal minded and if
Bracken had any suggestions for the
[literature racks in the YMCA hut
lthey would gladly be received.

To insure co-operation of all mem-
bers of the YMCA on all the major
,projects, at least, a new division in
lthe YMCA has been created, the coun-
icil. It will be the work of the mem-
bers  the council to sell every major
move of the YMCA to the campus. All
members of the cabinet are automat-
aically members of the council.

_Vote Stands 310-150 .

“Does it not seem strange,” de-l
clared James Danahey, C34, at the
Student council meeting last Wednes-
day evening, “that 500 students peti-
tioned council for a change in govern-,
ment, and yet only 460 took thei
trouble to vote on the issue at all?”

Danahey referred to the special elec-
tion conducted on the campus last
week to decide upon the approval or
rejection of the new Student—Faculty
association of the University. After
all ballots had been counted by a
group working under Richard Wet-
tach, BA34, it was found that the
change had been approved, 310 to 150.

At only one balloting place did
students voting favor the present gov-
ernmental system. Dental students
polled eighty-four votes to eighty back-
ing an unchanged Student council. ’l‘he
vote at State hall was 61 to 11; at
Alumni hall, 62 to 27; at Thaw hall,
35 to 16; and at the Cathedral, 72 to
12, all approving the change.

Faculty association will now continue
its plans for the spring elections.

In order to see if graduation ex-
penses might not be reduced, Mc-
Parland appointed Danahey to see
John. W. Vveber, business manager of
the University, in regard to possible
reductions in diploma and cap and
gown costs.

Through the president, council was
to recommend to Eugene Haverty,
E34, chairman of the Spring Festival,
that all activities participating in the
spring tapping ceremonies contribute
toward the expenses of the event.

A recommendation will be presented
to Chancellor John G. Bowman, as a
result of a council discussion, that
both activities and scholastic tapping
take place together this year. In ad-
dition, the members decided that ap-
plicants for the position of permanent
class secretary should be selected
through John W. I-Iallock, secretary
of the General Alumni association.
rather than through the dean of men’s
ofﬁce.

First Laurels Of ‘Torch Bearers’ Go To Carl Cassi
For Splendid Staging Of Last Production Of Year

C o in p e t e n t Cast, Finished
Set, Combine To Give
Hilarious Satire

By Maxine Garrison

Our plaudits to Pitt Players for
their ﬁnal production this season are
necessarily late, but none the less
hearty. It was a completely satisfied
audience that left the YM-WHA
auditorium last Wednesday evening,
after seeing the Players’ splendid
work in George Kelly's farce on em-
ateur dramatic productions, “The
'l‘orchbeai‘ers.”

To Carl B. Cass, director, go the
first laurels, for one of the best pieces
of stage management we have seen.
During the first act, when nine or
ten people remained on the stage, Cass
grouped and moved his clearacters so
skillfully that not once was the audi-
ence’s attention focused wrong The
backstage scene of the second act

(credit for the clever setting goes to.

Alice Elson and Charles Foreman),
with the continuous, entrances and ex-

its was handled just as well, and the
actors made good liilariously in their
minor acrobatic stunts of tripping over
properties. .

The generally commendable acting
makes it difficult to select the best
performances, but Carolyn Hall and
Helen Rose C-ibson, both appearing for
the first time, deserve especially high
ranking. Miss Hall as the thrice-
married Nellie Fell, was delightful,
with her infectious high-pitched
laugh and ingratiating simple—minded-
ness. Miss Gibson as the stage-struck
wife was pleasingly confused in her
attempts to reconcile her “gift” with
her home duties. Vvilliam Pigott, the
cruelly frank young husband, gave a
restrained but effective performance.
(Betty Quarrie did not disappoint with
{her ﬁnal performance for the Players;
as the imperious Mrs. Pampinelli she
was splendid in her denunciation
scene in the last act. Alice Elson, as

-in the Players’ last show this year

the maid, and Marquis Patterson, as
the artistic Mr. Spindler, were equally i in Ke1ly’S hit comedy,

Large Audience Completely

convincing. Nelson Mills, Ben Struble,
Barbara Mateer, Charles Blaker and
Fern VVolf rounded out the excellent
cast.

The Players have never been bet-
ter in delivering their lines_ Not a
punch-line, and there were many, was
muffed. Mrs. Pampinelli’s rendition
of, “There will still be actresses.
long after husbands are a thing of
the past," was something to be re-
membered. No production details were
slighted; the startlingly crude make-
up on the Little Theater aspirants in
the second act was a particularly good
touch,

The careful workmanship evident
marks them as being an exceptionally
efﬁcient group. They drew to the last
drop all the entertainment to be found

l Must Fraternities Go?

YOUNG LADY at the. University of Wisconsin had difficulty at her soror-
A ity. She left the campus with the intention never to see her family or
friends again. A nation-wide search instigated by her disappearance is still
being carried on. Her father, grief—stric.ken, demanded that fraternities be
abolished at the University of VVisconsin.

Such is the incident which raises the question, “Must fraternities go?”
Along with inevitable sweeping reforms in our educational methods for the
approaching few decades will there be a general movement among colleges
and universities to do away with fraternities To the Pitt News it appears
as though fraternities are soon to undergo either radical changes or complete
abolition.

To those of our friends who will shout that the recent VVisconsin inci-
dent is not sufficient reason to ask that fraternities be completely abolished,
we might point out the short—comings of fraternities as we have seen them:

1. Most important, they breed clannishness and snobbery among the
population of a school, creating an unwholesome social environment.

2. They create cliques and take part in campus politics, thus widen-
ing the breach between groups of students who should in reality be work-
ing together for the welfare of the school.

3. Most colleges, and Pitt may be included here, do not NEED fra-

ternities. Because of physical environment at Pitt and other schools like
it, a real campus spirit cannot be made to exist. A

4. In many cases they sidetrack loyalty. A Pitt freshman lately
publically informed the writer that his fraternity meant more to him
than the University or anything else.

5. They do not seek to allow men of their membership to get them-
selves interested in activities, but bait freshmen with promises of jobs on
campus activities, jobs for which the youngsters are rarely ﬁtted.

These and many other reasons have made fraternities more or less un-
popular on many campuses. Certain schools will allow no fraternities to
exist on their premises. So far as we have been able to observe, these
schools have not been injured the slightest iota by the removal of these
“indispensable” social centers. , .

The Wisconsin incident, others of its type, and hundreds of other affairs
which have not reached the public prints, indicate that there is something
deﬁnitely not so wholesome in Denmark. Colleges that do not NEED frater-
nities should get rid of them. Others who think they NEED them could
follow Yale’s example. The University of Pittsburgh could well appoint a
committee to weigh the fraternities in the balance of service to the school
and see whether or not somebody’s thumb has been pressing on the main
spring.

i Pitt's New Government

 

AST WEDNESDAY the students of the University by a vote of two to

one changed the legislative set-up of the campus. A change for which
the student body asked many times in the past was ﬁnally effected. We feel
as though the move is the most important legislative change in University
undergraduate circles in the last 25 years.

James Danahey, vice president of Student council, at a meeting of that
group on the evening of the election, asked what had happened to the 500
students who signed the petition to change the student government since
only 460 students voted at the polls. Two reasons may be given for the light
vote: . . .

1. The failure of the Pitt News to properly pu-blicize the election in
the Friday issue in which the constitution of the new form was offered.
Most students weren’t aware of the election until last Wednesday and
were unable to get their registration cards.

2. In order to have general campus elections before May 1, the ap-
proval vote was hurried by council. This gave approximately one week
from the day the special committee oﬂered the by-laws to council and the
day of the election.

However, the new student form was passed. Although the vote was un-
usually light, the margin by which the form was approved is an indication of
the wish of the student body in general. The outstanding features of the
new form are:

Abolition of internal elections.

Insurance of representation of minorities.
Representation of faculty and administration.
Enlarged powers and broadened scope of activities.
New and improved nominating system.

The spring elections which will take place shortly will determine the
personnel of the new setup. VVith personalities taking the center of the
stage, it is expected that a huge number of voters will be attracted to the
polls. The Pitt News will continue its ﬁght in the interests of the student
body in general and of the unorganized mass of students in particular. The
new form of government must have the best men and women that the
campus can offer. It is imperative that students of ability and none others
be chosen to ﬁll seats in the University assembly.

The day of political privateering on the Pitt campus is past. Let it be
everyone's expressed ideal that the University assembly will be a University
group interested in the University’s welfare. We ought not to allow self-
interest groups to again dominate the scene. These groups themselves must

.v*e.w.w.H

forget their own welfare and rededicate themselves to the University. Stu-.

dents of merit and of ability must ﬁll assembly seats. “Nice” boys and girls
who comb their hair right and dance the Carioca may be excellent dinner
company, but it will take more than that to become a University assembly-
nian. For this the Pitt News will constantly ﬁght. '

An Editorial

What Great Illusion?

1 ECRGE HORACE LORIMER-, editor of the
- Saturday Evening Post, or one of his editorial
writers, joined the chorus
Roosevelt's brain trust with a long-winded edito-
rial labeled “The Great Illusion.”

Asserting‘ that “the country is headed to the left

’ and “instead of

labor and capital working together there is a drift
toward impossible conditions for capital,” the edi-

“college boys, irrespective of

their age” who make up Mr. Roc-.sevelt’s advisory
board. The editorial is not only excited and Vitu-
perative, it is pointless to the end, offerhig no sug-
gestions to replace the NRA, the AAA, and the
brain trust.

It is sad that a paper so widely read as the Post
should speak of the President ’s advisers as “these
smart, shallow young men who are so cocksure
and so determined to make us all over in ﬁve or
ten minutes.” And it is sad that an editorial
writer show his lack of information by asking the
question, “Do we want a democratic or a collec-
tive system?” Oswald Spengler, the greatest
enemy of democracy, time and time again has an-

and millions of distressed, bankrupt farmers give a

full, and while “liberty” cannot guarantee shelter

Frosh Women Revert
To Type In Recent
Fashion Show

 

The SRO sign was hung on the
l.-Icinz House door VVednesday after-
noon when about 200 coeds gathered
there to see the fashion show spon-
sored by the freshman class. The
girls can now talk. glibly to their
friends about that new windblown
silhouette and the fact that King Cot-
ton will reign supreme this summer.

They learned that to be in style at
' that next formal they should be heard
as well as seen. All of which does
not mean that our coeds will burst
forth with a plentitude of verbiage,
but that the rustling sound made by
the swishing of taffeta is the latest
mode. _

There was considerable arguing
about which creation brought forth
the most oohs and ahs. Some were
in favor of a “perfectly darling"
spring formal of yellow organdie with
very full wing-like sleeves. A long,
fitted cocktail dress of black with
white organdie Queen Christina ‘col-
lar and cuffs brought forth the sighs
from some of the more sophisticated
members of the audience. (Editor’s
note: Do sophisticated women sigh?)

Rasketeers Win
Coaches’ Conclave 0
Cage Tourney

 

South Carolina. Shatters Pitt’s
Thirteen Game Winning
Streak In Close Tilt

By Charles A. Ruch

“lt: was great!” “Boy, what a. trip!”
“I wish I could have brought back a
bushel of those grape fruits at 49
cents a bushel." “Talk about southern
hospitality." These and similar re-
marks are just about all that can be
had at an_v one time from the Golden
Panlzlier basketeers as they reflect.
upon that trip to Georgia for the
coaches’ convention during the Easter
vacation.

Froin all reports, the trip was a
great. success and there are none to
say nay. Starting out on March 27
amid a pouring rain, the gang jour-
neyed on tlirough that rain until they
hit Durham, North Carolina. After a
hit of trouble in locating the home of
the Duke Blue Devils, the party re-
mained there over night. The end of
the second day found the team and
followers in Columbia, South Carolina,
where a game was played with the
South Carolina Gamecocks. The Car-
olinans came out ahead after a torrid
game, shattering a Pitt win streak
that had gone to precisely thirteen
straight.

Once the boys got into Atlanta and
had a chance to rest up a bit, the
results became quite different. In
their game with [)e Kalb Teachers‘
college on the opening night of the
tournament, Tliursday night, the Cats
showed the people of the south just
how a real basketball aggregation
works. It took the Teachers 11 min-
utes of a 20-minute encounter to ﬁnd
the hoop for their ﬁrst ﬁeld goal,
while the Panthers put on a bewilder-
ing passing attack that aroused no
little comment aniong the coaches
present. Illinois Wesleyan won from
the South Carolina boys in the pre-
liniinary event of the evening.

Friday night brought together the
winners of 'l‘liursday night's games
and once again Skip Hiighes broke
loose to lead the Paiitlicr scorers to
victory in another half-length game.
The coiiipetitioii this time was a bit
tougher but Pitt held the upper hand
throughout and came out the winner,
18-15. Weper, Wesleyan forward, net-
ted 13 of his teanis' points. The Carl-
sonmen were thus adjudged the win-
ners of the convention tournament.

The business part of the conven-
tion brought forth much controversy,
especially in regards to the use of a
zone defense. This type of play, it is
agreed, is tending to slow up the game
considerably. While no moves were
made to outlaw the zone defense for
the coming season, it is very evident
that something will be done shortly
to cope with this situation. Several
rules of radical sort, from raising the
baskets two feet higher to marking
off “stalls” on the court in which each
player must remain until after the
tlpoﬁ’, were suggested, although it is
very unlikely that any of them will
get ofﬁcial sanction. Generally, the
coaches appeared very well satisﬁed
with the rules code as it stands.

The Golden Cats have now deﬁnite-
ly brought down the curtain on their
basketball activities for the year. The
three co-captains, Charley Hughes,
I)on McCamant and Russ Ochsenhirt
have wound up their careers with the
Blue and Gold, as Dr. Carlson watches
three-ﬁfths of a very great basketball
team forsake Panther spangles after
four years of brilliant service,

Panthers Meet
Six New Rivals

Total Of Twenty-three Games
Comprises New Schedule

 

 

Pitt’s ofﬁcial basketball schedule
for the 1934-35 season has six new
opponents on the list of Panther op-
ponents. A total of twenty-three
games comprises the new card, ten
of which are included in the Eastern
Intercollegiate conference.

’l‘lie Panthers will meet Bucknell
in two games in the conference, this
being the ﬁrst time Pitt has opposed
the Bisons in recent years. Other
new rivals on the coming season's
schedule include Iowa, Wisconsin,
Fordham, Navy and Penn State.

Once more Pitt Will take its “suicide"
swing through the 1nid—west early in
the season. Northwestern, Iowa and
Butler will be met in four successive
nights. Twelve days later the Cats
will again journey westward to meet
the Wisconsin Badgers.

Although the official announcement
must be forthcoming from the Uni-
versity Athletic commission, Coach
Carlson is recommending that Skip
Hughes and Claire Cribbs, the sole re-
maining members of the varsity ﬁve,
be chosen co-captains for the coming
season. Both will be playing their
last year in competition at Pitt.

The complete schedule follows:

December 8 ________ .._ Bucknell at Pittsburgh
December 14 ____ __Northwestern at Evanston
December 15 ............. -_Iowa at Iowa City

Collegiate Meet
To Feature Clinic

Outdoor Track And Field Handi-
caps Planned For April 14

With the ﬁrst annual indoor inter-
-iraternity track and ﬁeld meet taking
place too late last night to make to-
.iay’s edition, the indoor track season
has come to an end and preparations
are now under way for the opening
of the outdoor season, scheduled for
April 14,
(‘oincidental with the announcement
of the annual track and ﬁeld handi-
;'.’l.1lH on that date, comes the state-
ment from Coach Carl Olson that Pitt
will sponsor an intercollegiate meet
at the Stadium on June 2. Several en-
tries for the latter affair have been
received from local and district col-
lege teams and Olson expects a fine
turnout of entries from all sections
of the country.
The annual handicap meet will go
on as a part of Olsoii’s track and ﬁeld
clinic, scheduled to begin at 10 o’glock
on Saturday a week. This clinic falls
in line with other athletic clinics:
sponsored with so much success by‘
the University. Olson’s clinic will
feature a series of slow—motion pic-
tures of actual track action, which
will be interpolated with the discus-
sions of training and instruction
methods.
After the morning session and a
recess for lunch, those attending the
;:linic will reconvene at the Stadium
for the handicaps track meet. Olson
is now arranging a list of “scratch”
men and ﬁguring out the handicaps
which will be allowed for each entry.
The “scratch” men are the varsity
men who will be required to go the
full distance in events. Other entries
will be given handicaps of varied dis-
tance, according to their abilities,

Olson is anxious that any men who
have not yet “taken a crack at track”
come out for the affair on April 14.
Novices have quite a fair chance in a
handicap meet as the track coaches
are not the least bit stingy with their
handicaps for their “stars.” As Olson
says, “Anything can happen in a
handicap meet.”

Ball Plans Deferred

A deﬁnite statement was announced
this week that plans for the Interna-
tional Ball have been cancelled due
to all efforts at present being concen-
trated on the Cathedral campaign.

The varsity swimming team coin-,
peted in its final meet of the season!

in the National Collegiate c.liampion—t
ships whicli took place last Saturday

in the Ohio State pool in Columbus,
Ohio, Coach Corr entered only four
men, who competed in only one
£3"v'€lli., the 400-yard freestyle relay.

the Panther team was composed of:
Jack Denny, Paul Stinner, Russell
L.ll‘i(ll)el‘g', and Jack Hanna. The team
iiiiislied in sixth place. Michigan won
the race, followed by Rutgers, gioiitlli»
ern California, Yale, Iowa an tie
Panthers in sixth place. ’ I
The Michigan team was the winner
~3f.tl1e meet having scored 30 points],
Southern California was second wit
1.9 points, and Rutgers third with 14
points.

Jack Medica, of Washington was
the high individual scorer winning
three Oﬁrst places for a tdtal of 15
points. In winning the 440—yard free-
style race M,edica set a new world
record, 4.46:8 seconds. He also won
ﬁrsts in the 220-yard freestyle and the
1500 meter race. _ _
The National meet climaxed the
most successful swimming season in
the history of the, sport at Pitt.
The team tied for first place in the
Eastern Swimming association con-
ference, won third place in the East-
ern Championships, and won its four
scheduled dual n1eets_ _ I t
The Panthers won their dua mee s
against conference competitors easily
Carnegie Tech was defeated
54 to 20, I<‘ranklin and Marshall 44 to
27, and the Universitytof Dglﬁixiage 45
to 14. The swimmers ‘rom io a. e
university gave the Panthers the
toughest meet of the season, in which
the ﬁnal event determined the win-
ner. The Pitt team by winning the
relay won the meet by a 42 to 29
score.

In the Carnegie Tech meet the
Panthers made a clean sweep of first
places, taking firsts in all of the in-
dividual events, and losiiig the rleilay
on a disqualiﬁcation. Athougi er-
man Adlersberg and Jack Dennty werle
the high scorers of the mee , eaci
winning two first places, the D€‘1"f01‘111‘

on Ti'e-es’ Pool records as in the Pitt-
Ohio State meet. Four new times
were made in this meet. Ohio State
making two and the Paiitliers also
setting up two new time records. Rus-
sell Lindberg bettered the record in
the 220—yard freestyle event, covering
the distance in 2.21:3/5 seconds, and
the Pitt relay team of Hanna, Stin-
ner, Chambers, and Madden set ?’iTew'
pool record for the 400-yard relay.
I‘-‘ela, Ohio State backstroker hung up
one new mark for the visitors, and
Colville, the Ohio State brcaststrokei-
bettered the record in the 200-yard
bieaststroke race. The record break-
ing time of the relay team was needed
to give the Panthers 3. 42 to 29 point
victory.

Franklin and Marshall was the only
team to win more than two first
places against the Panthers in dual
meets. The F and M team won the
dive, relay and backstroke events.
John Carik, saw his perfect record for
first place in three years of div-
ing for the Pitt team [all in this meet.
Judges found something wrong with
the approach used by Carik, and con-
sequently marked down his score
considerably. Gordon Clialmers, mem-
ber of the last Olympic team won the
backstroke, and the F and M relay
team won by a hand’s length, Adlers-
berg and Denny again led the scorers
with 10 points apiece.

In the meet with Delaware the
visitors were considerably outclassed.
Delaware won only one first place,
and the ﬁnal score 45 to 14 in the
Pantlier’s favor indicates that fact.
Herman Adlersberg turned in a better
time for the
than the record made by Colville, of
Ohio State, and brought the breast-
stroke record back to Pitt. His time
was 2.36:3/5 which bettered the for-
mer mark by 1/5 of a second.

In the Eastern championships which
took place in the Delaware pool, the
Pitt team won third place. Rutgers
won ﬁrst place, and New York univer-
sity won second place. The relay
team of Lindberg, Hanna, Denny, and
Adlersberg won second place, Lind-
llfg‘ took second place in the back-
stroke event and Hanna won second
place. in the 440-yard freestyle race.

By Robert: E. Badger
Pitt: News Sports Editor

What with the sound of toe meeting leather and all that sort of thing
as the good old varsity gridders grunt and groan in their spring drills, it
does not seem inappropriate to talk of the grand old American game of feets-
ball. Dr. Sutherland-‘s prospects for the coming season are a mixture of good
and had.

011 the unfavorable side of the ledger are the loss of eight reg'1il:11's from
last season’s team, an extremely difficult schedule for the coming season,
and a be1ow—par freshman squad coming up. Perhaps the greatest losses in
red ink are the eight regulars who ﬁnished
their VL.ll'Slty careers last fall. Skladany,
"Walton, Onder, l\lereditli, Hogan, Sebas-
tian, ()’Dell, and ’l‘imnioiis are going to be
missed very much. Add to this the loss
of sucli valuable subs as Dick Matesic,
and the red ink coiiipanies can declare
dividends.

’l‘liere is no arguing about. wliether or
not tlie I-’a.iitlier scliedule for next year is
a toiigli one. VVasliiiigtoii and .l’efferson,
VVest Virgiiiia, Southern (‘.alil'ornia, l\«Iiniie-
sota, VVestniinsto.r, Nebraska, Notre Dame.
Carnegie Tech, and Navy promise to
make some very good attempts at tweak-
ing the tail of the Panther. The only one
not liaviiig a good cliaiice. to be Si‘lt"1('eSSftll
is '\Vestniinster. The Panthers will enter
the Soiit.hei'n California and Miiiiiesota
games on the short end of the betting and
will probably be no better than even bets
against Nebraska. Usually Coach Suther-
land is able to recruit anywhere from six
to ten good prospects from the ranks of
the previous season's freshman team. This
year only three, Quarantello, O’Niel, and
Avizienis have shown enough to warrant

D“ Jahn B‘ Sutherland predicting a bright future for them. This-
should not be taken too seriously, however, for the memory of Warren Heller
who was not able to make the freshman team and who later developed into
an All-American is still fresh in mind. Another frosli star upon whom the
Panther coaches were counting heavily was VVilliam Dorsey who surprised
everybody here by leaving and enrolling at West Point.

But, now for the brighter side. Back from last year are Kliskey, Shot-
well, Rooker, Captain Hartwig, \-Veinstock, Weisenbaugli, Ormiston, Oleoj-
nisak, Baxter, Detzel, Hoel, Kutz, Munjas, Nicksick, Randour, and Shedlosky.
From the freshman squad of two years ago are Greene, Mal-arkey and La
Rue, all bright prospects. Two positions about which Dr. Sutherland will not
have to worry are fullback and center. Weinstock will take good care of
the fullback position and Kliskey and Shotwell should do quite well at
center. The ends are a problem. Right now, Baxter, Rocker, and Quaran-
tello seem to have the inside track. The light for the tackle posts is wide
open with Hoel, Oleojnisak, and Detzel leading the pack. Captain I’-lartwig
is a ﬁxture at one guard. Kutz and Ormiston are leading in the light for the
other guard post. The qiiartei-back position will be taken care of by Miiiijas
and Greene. Vveisenbaugh, Shedlosky, Randour, and Nit-ksick are leading
candidates for the halfbacks, but there is a good cliziiice that some of the
other less heralded candidates will come up and cop a first team bertli.

One thing that is absolutely necessary to the success of any football
team, and it most certainly holds true for next year here, is that there be
close cooperation between those in charge of the team and the student body.
Too often the athletic department goes its way; the student body its way.
Result . . complete lack of what we call “school spirit!” In most cases
the fault is not with one or the other of the two parties, but is partly the
fault of each. The athletic department should make the utmost effort to have
the good will of the student body, and the student body should take more in-
terest in the affairs of its school. When we have each side exerting a maxi-
mum effort we have the ideal athletic arrangement. Next year's team, with
the hardest schedule in Pitt history, will need all the encouragement that can
be given it. We, for one, hope it gets it.

Spring Training Discloses Keen Competition For Varsity Football Posts

 

Coaches Stress Fundamentals;
Wcisenbaugh Shifted To Halfback

 

Quarantillo, Out For
Wing Position

 

he weather, which was just right
for spring football practice, until
VVednesday’s rainy spell put some-
what of a halt to the organized spring
training sessions. VVorkouts consist—l
ed of individual instruction in funda-
mentals as much as possible with so
large a squad. Backﬁeld men were
passing to ends and other backs, line-i
men were instructed in the funda-'
mentals of line Dlay.

After three Scrimmages it is still
safe to say that none of the varsity
berths are cinched. End positions
were thrown wide open, by the sur-:

l
I

urising ability of Eddie Quarantello,
who played quarterback on last
year's freshman eleven. Quarantello

has the making of a ﬁne end, and will;
give the veteran Booker at close race!

when it is time to select a starting;
line-up, Quarantello is rather heavy,i
but his heftiness in no way impedes,
his speed, and comes in quite handy]
in defense work. {

Arthur Detzel, heavyweight on the
wrestling team, is pushing the much
heavier and experienced veteran,
Stanley Olejnisak for a position at
tackle on the right side of the line!
What Detzel lacks in weight and?
experience to Olejnisak, he makes up;
in speed and aggressiveness. Nick
Kliskey and George Sho-twell, both
veterans, are ﬁghting it out for the
center position.

The two fullbacks, Weinstock and
Vfeisenbaugh from last year, are back
for another year. There is littile to_
choose from between these players.
Vlfeinstock is much heavier than Wei-
senbaugh, but the la.tter is a-sprinter.
and for that reason may be shifted to
halfback. We-isenbaugh ﬁnished a
ﬁfty-yard sprint about a yard ahead
of any of the other backﬁeld candi-
dates. Should Vveisenbaugh be shift-
ed to half a suitable replacement for
\Veinstock would be lacking, ‘although
Rector may come through well
enough to handle‘ the relief duties.

By shifting Weisenbaugh from full-
back to halfback the Panthers will
have three high class performers for
each of the halfback posts. _Bob
LaRue and Leon Shedlosky, besides
VVeisenbaugh are candidates for the
right halfback position_ At the other
half Hub Randour, Leo Malarkey, and
Mike Nicksick are ﬁghting for a start-
ing berth. ‘

Miller Munjas and Arnold Greene
head the list of candidatees. for the
quarterback berth. Munjas, who
gained quite a lot of experience last
season, has that advantage over
Greene. Both men are good forward
passers, and punters.

winner of the Skibo title, 22 to 19, at
the Tartan ﬂoor Tuesday of last

Hartwig of Pitt took a pass from
Hogan and dribbled in under the
basket to score the ﬁrst two points of
the game; Greene of the same team,
added a ﬁeld goal soon after. Joe,
Mihm of Tech scored the only points;
for his ﬁve in the quarter, when he;
got loose for a two—pointer under the?
basket. A foul and a. ﬁeld goal put[
Pitt Delta Tau ahead 7 to 2 at then
quarter_ E

The Pitt players stayed in the lead}
until the third period, when with his}
side trailing 15 to 12, Douglas of Tech}
sank a ﬁeld goal and being fouled in;
the act of shooting, made good the?
foul. The score remained tied until}
the end of the quarter_ ;

In the ﬁnal stanza the Pitt Delts

In the preliminary game played be-

of Pitt defeated the Tech runner up,
Beta Theta Pi, 25 to 24. Heckler of
the Phi Delts made 15 points.

No Tour Director

Frank Carver, director of athletic publicity
at the University, may be very capable in
handling matters at that post. There are
several members of the basketball team and
a couple of coaches who are doubting Frank's
ability at directing trips. Carver offered to
rearrange the return itinerary and did so.
Carlson and Kowallis had each two ﬂat tires
and director Frank had none.

First Varsity Wrestling Team A
Since 1917 Completes Season

 

\Vrestling reappeared on the var-
sity sports calendar this year for the
ﬁrst time since 1917. Considering
that fact, the season was much more
successful than was expected. The
coaches, Dr. Sutherland and Joe
Orsini, had practically no experienced
wrestlers around whom they could
build a team. Enough interest was'
shown by the students to make the
fact apparent that there is a place
in sports for the mat game.

In matches won and lost the team
came through with a good enough av-
erage for the ﬁrst year. The team
lost two and evened it up by winning
the same number. It was very no-
ticeable that the wrestlers improved
considerably as the season progress-
ed.

The team lost a close match to the
wrestlers from Washington and Jef-
ferson. The fact that the Panthers,
had to forfeit in the 175-pound weight
class had a lot to do with the NV. and
J_ 21 to 13 point victory. The win-
ners won only one more match than
the Panthers and another on the for-
feit to win the match. Evans, Cap-
tain Bradford llsley, and Arthur Det-
zel were the three winners on the
Pitt team.

The West Virginia Mountaineers,
who (supported an exceptionally
strong team, humbled the Panthers,
26 to 10. illinchberger and Barr were
the winners for Pitt in this match.
Ilsley moved up to the 145-pound
weight division, which is ten pounds

they entered the ﬁnal match of the
season against the Waynesburg Yel-
low Jackets, won a close 16 to 12
point victory. Each team won four
of the eight matches. Pitt won the
victory however because two of the
Panther wrestlers won their matches
on falls. Cox and Detzel were the
two men who won their matches on
falls which ultimately decided the
out-come of the match. Ilsley and
Nicksick won their matches on time
advantages.

The team usually lined-up with
either Norman Evans or Rhinehart
Theissen wrestling in the 115-pound
division. Paul Hinchberger wrestled
in the 125-pound berth, Captain Ilsley
represented the Panthers in the 135-
pound class, Milliard Cox wrestled in
the 145-pound class, Albert Barr ﬁlled
the 155—pound class, Arthur Willets
wrestled in the 165-pound ranks, Mike
Nicksick wrestled in the 75-pound
division, and Arthur Detzel represent-
ed the Panthers i11 the heavyweight
class.

Arthur Detzel, who was one of the
best wrestlers on the team was named
captain of the team for next year.
Detzel lost only one match all sea-
son. Besides winning his three col-
lege matches he won the heavy-weight
title in a Junior Allegheny Mountain
association meet.

Relations Cited

Inquiry Club Members Hear
Dean Laud Cathedral As
Solution To Problems

 

Speaking before his ﬁrst Student
Inquiry group, Dr. Vincent W‘. Lan-
fear, (lean of men, expressed in what
he terms, “a few general assumptions"
his desire for better student faculty
relations and a freer exchange of
opinions.

“There are a lot of problems in this
University and other universities that
can best be answered and solved by
an open honest exchange of informa-
tion and opinion between the student
and faculty. There are many things
that go on at Pitt the professors can’t
possibly see or realize and many that
students don’t see or realize. Solution
of remedies for these things can only
come about when both groups realize
the facts and make some cooperative
effort to bring about the remedy.”

Dean Lanfear was very optimistic
about the value of the Cathedral in
serving to bring about closer student-
faculty friendships. To the students
who believed the faculty members did
not want to bother with students out-
side of class hours, Dean Lanfear
said, “The faculty members are in-
terested in student problems and the
students but many of them feel that
they would not be welcome if they
entered into student discussions other
than those in the class room.”

In answer to a student’s question
of how such an exchange of ideas
can come about he said, “Would it not
be well to furnish a room

Druids Announce
Regulations For
Spring Tapping
Petitions Available Now In Dean

Of lVIen’s Oﬂiee; Must Be
Returned Next Friday

 

Druids, national sophomore men's
honorary activities fraternity, an-
nounced today the regulations regard-
ing non;ine..tions for the spring tap-
ping ceremony to take place on activ-
ities tap day, Friday, May 4. Petitions
may be obtained at the dean of men's
office, in Room 801, Cathedral, today
and must be returned by next Friday
noon, according to Edward Durkin,
C, president.

Two major changes in the tapping
proceedings and one change in the
nominating regulations will be in-
augurated in this year’s selection of
Druids. Heretofore the honorary so-
ciety has adhered to a policy of tap-
ping twelve men each spring. Accord-
ing to a revision in the constitution,
the full quota of twelve men need
not be tapped. This procedure may
result if the present Druid group does
not feel that twelve eligible men ful-

in thelﬁn the qualiﬁcations of Druids. The

Cathedral. Where the students and Iother tapping change calls for a pub-

faculty could get together and in an
informal way talk about the problems
of the University? In a room such as
this regular sessions of this kind could
take place.

“After May 1, when I move into my
new home, I shall hold open house
for all the students who have prob-
lems to talk about or suggestions to
make about the problems of the Uni-
versity.

“The University has one of the
finest groups of men assembled in
any one school in the country,” con-
cluded Dean Lanfear, “and I don’t
speak from hearsay for I’ve taught at
the University of Texas, Columbia uni-
versity, Princeton and other schools.”

Howard Cohen, C34, ex-chairman of
the Inquiry club, announced the next
series of meetings: Next Vvednesday
in Heinz House Dr. Bevin, former of-

ﬁcer of the Federal Council of
Churches, will speak about reli-
gion; on April 18, Eli Hughes, an

attorney, will defend the sales tax,
and George Evans, president of the
Pittsburgh Henry George club, will
oppose the sales tax; on April 25,
Dr. Ralph Turner, professor of his-
tory, will talk about the AAA, and
the concluding meeting will be ad-
dressed by the Rev. Bernard C. Claus-
en of the First Baptist church.

Meda Will Meet Today
To Elect Class Conveners

 

Today at 12:30 o’clock at Heinz
House all members of Meda, women's
scholastic fraternity, will meet to
elect their class conveners, to serve
for a term of one year,

Nominees are as follows: Fresh-
men, Dorothy Dresser, C37, and Ruth
Shapiro, C37; sophomore, Nona
Monks, C36, and Jane Robertson, C36;
juniors, Alice Roth, Ed35, and Mil-
dred Hopkins, Ed35; and seniors,
Marjorie Collins, C34, and Phyllis
Cook, C34.

The nominating committee included:
Freshmen, Dorothy Odenheimer,C37;
sophomore, Leah Stark, C36; juniors,
Frieda Goldstein, C35; and seniors,
Bertha Bailey, Ed34.

lic reading of a tappee’s list of activ-
ities at the time he is tapped.

In the matter of nomination peti-
tions, the regulation in force last year
which required each candidate to
write a statement concerning his
merits for election has been dis-
carded. This change is designed to
encourage more applications for elec-
tion_

The nominations meeting of the
present Druid body will take place
next Friday afternoon, at which time
all petitions will be read and acted
upon. Meanwhile a committee under
the direction of Russell Connolly, C,
will obtain a letter from each of the
heads of the various campus activ-
ities. These letters will contain the
recommendations of each activity
head as to the degree of participation
of freshmen and ﬁrst semester soph-
omores in his activity, The letters will
be read as a part of the nominations
meeting.

The full list of eligible candidates
will then be checked by a committee
consisting of Durkin, William Dornen-
burg, C, and Charles Ruch, C.

In a statement made yesterday,
Durkin said, “I have learned from
the various activity leaders that the
degree of participation in activities by
freshmen this year is much above the
average. With this in view, there ap-
pears to be no reason that the Druid
group cannot tap this spring a list of
men whose qualiﬁcations are entirely
adequate for membership in Druids.
Also, I believe all this can be done
in a manner which will be in direct
keepingiwith the high standards for
which the Druids of this year are
aiming.”

Each petition must include the fol-
lowing:

(1) A statement of the petitioner’s
activities and the degree of his par-
ticipation,

(2) An accurate and complete rec-
ord of his scholarship for the preced-

ing semester.

(3) The signatures of ﬁve male

Coeds Wipe Out Male
Opponents In Last
Bridge Tourney

Two coeds made the bridge
team to represent the University
of Pittsburgh at the Contract
Bridge club “duplicate” tourna-
ment on ‘Wednesday afternoon,
March 28, in the Faculty Club,
Hotel Schenley. Finessing and
discarding their way through
“stiff” male opposition, and at
the same time applying psychic
bids, end-plays, and various coups,
Josephine Pollock, C34, and Jane
Mitchel, C35, cleverly nosed out
the rest of the ﬁeld in the East
and West positions. Four “tops,”
ﬁve “seconds,” and one tie for
“top” enabled them to amass a
total of 14% points against 13‘-,2
for their closest rivals.

Sitting in the North and South
positions, Franklin Hockensmith,
C36, and Leonard Seder, C37, de-
cisively outclassed all their op-
ponents with a. score of 19; their
closest rivals had a score of 9%.
Out of 12 boards Hockensmith
and Seder scored nine “tops,” and
were the only pair in the tourna-
mcnt who were successful in mak-
ing a small slam in no trump (re-
doubled) for one of these “tops."
