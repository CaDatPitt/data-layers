Safety head Brennan

By Lou Grieco
Staff Writer

Actions speak louder than
words. 50, Bill Brennan, the new
director of Public Safety at the
University of Pittsburgh, began
his plan of action.

At an awards ceremony for
Campus Police officers held in
the Faculty Club last night, Bren-
nan brought together campus
police, city police, local business-
men, administration officials and
students. '

After two weeks on the job,
Brennan said he is beginning to
form the ”community partner-
ships” he has stressed as being
crucial to preventing crime in
Oakland. This is the main objec-
tive of Brennan's plan for the
Campus Police.

”Without communications,
barriers form between people of
different organizations,” Brennan
said. ”When you bring people
together in an informal setting,
you break down the barriers."

Part of the ceremony involved

outlines police plan

the promotion of personnel who
Brennan said were key to his suc-
cess. Walter V. Waters was
promoted to first assistant direc-
tor; Janet D. Thomas was promot-
ed to assistant director of
administration; and Timothy R.
Delaney was promoted to captain
for field operations. _

Gary A. Moses will retain the
title of assistant director of field
services, but his duties will be ex-
panded to include training plain-
clothes and detective units.
Brennan also gave out commen-
dations for good service and
20-year certificates to qualifying
officers.

”We’re quick to criticize these
people when they make a mis-

take,” Brennan said. ”But often, ,

we're not so quick to recognize
the good things they do.

”These people are uniformed
professionals who are out there
day after day, doing a very impor-
tant job: protecting your life and
property.”

Brennan continued to stress the

-The winter term is passing
quickly, and April is drawing
nearer. April means graduation
time, and for seniors without a
job awaiting them in the ”real
world,” this couI_d be a time for
panic.

To alleviate some of this bur-
den, Pitt's placement center is
working on bringing over 500

’ companies to campus this year.

The placement center's main

function is to coordinate'job~in- '_

terviews for Pitt students. It also
sponsors resume and interview-
ing workshops, does‘ resume
referrals, and delivers recruiter
mail,-all to strengthen students’
chances of receiving quality job

For The Pitt News

Among the various pro-
grams and services designed
to educate and _ enhance
campus-wide health practices,
Pitt's Student Health Service is
also providing a cardiopulmo-
nary resuscitation training
seminar for. interested
students.

CPR training provides the
student with certification by
the American Heart Associa-
tion. Training is offered in
either a basic four-hour or an
advanced eight-hour course.

The courses begin with a
lecture session in which par-
ticipants are taught anatomy in
the area of the heart and lungs.
Coronary artery and heart dis-
eases are discussed.

Topics of prudent health |iv- ‘
ing, or tips on improving one's
health, how to recognize heart
attacks and what to do, and
cardiac arrest are also ad-
dressed.

After the lecture portion of-

the course, the actual CPR

Health Service offers CPR lessons

technique is taught. Each stu-
dent practices_ his skills, and
testing is completed at the end
of, the second session. The
written test deals with materi-
al covered in lecture and con-
sists of 50 multiple choice
questions. In these classes, the
emphasis is on skill and the
prevention of heart attacks.
The instructors of the class,
Jeff Hackman and Chris Mazi-
arz, are both certified by the
AHA in CPR techniques.
Hackman has been involved
in the ‘emergency medica-I
field for five years and is certi-
fied as an instructor and a

trainer in CPR, as well as an ‘

emergency medical techni-

cian. This EMT certification al-

lows Hackman to be a part of
an ambulance team and re-
quires 80 to 100 hours of train-
ing and 10 hours of clinical
experience.

' The information presented
in this course provides par-
ticipants with knowledge of
how to live healthier lives and
prevent heartattacks, as well

It has been estimated by the
AHA that if CPR were started
before an emergency vehicle
arrived, 100,000 to 200,000
lives could be saved per year.

In the AHA course present-
ly being offered, freshman
nursing students are put
through eight hours of train-
ing. They are led through ex-
ercises on the resuscitation
measures to be used on an
adult, a child and an infant.
Specific techniques to use on’
obstructed airways are also
taught.

These CPR classes are taught
to all university pharmacy and
nursing students and are also
open to the general public.

Offered during the fall and
winter terms, the classes are
also open to all Universityof
Pittsburgh students and faculty
members at no cost. After
passing the course, the par-
ticipants will be certiﬁed by
the AHA, for a three-year
period.

On Feb. 24 and 25, a course
will be offered to teach those

as CPR procedures.

Israeli militarypolicy
an ineffectivesolution

Israel has established a new method to quiet Palestini-
ans uprising in the West Bank that is comparable to ter-
rorism.

Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said soldiers would be
allowed to fire at demonstrators to ”punish” them, but
the rubber-covered and plastic bullets the Israelis are us-
ing have frequently been fired at close range and have
proven to be as lethal as the real thing. Recently, Israeli-
controlled hospitals in the West Bank have been turning
away wounded Palestinians because the government re-
fuses to pay for their medical care.

Israel finds itself practicing the same oppression which
historically led to the need for its own existence. Shamir’s
justification of Palestinian treatment has received nega-
tive responses from Israeli soldiers and has left the coun-
try with a bad taste in its mouth. Israel's current actions
are crude attempts to ignore a problem it must deal with.

Israeli hard-liners have kept Israel from dealing with the
PLO and Yasir Arafat, who, at this moment, are the Pales-
tinians’ only representatives. Industry Minister Ariel Sha-
ron said that there will be no peace as long as Arafat ”runs
around aIive.” Killing does not beget peace, as Arafat him-
self seems to have realized. The Israeli government should
learn a similar lesson. ,

.-If Israel is truly concerned with peace, then the only
choice seems to be to negotiate with the PLO and the
Palestinians. The policy of not negotiating with terrorists
works when the terrorists act like terrorists. The PLO is
playing a new game, and Israel should think about chang-

ing its attitude. The possibilities of peace are too high not
to take the chance.

In a nutshell...

”Ordinary people in the, four corners of the globe
do love me.” -

—— Col. Moammar Gadhafi

. ”If I were one of my husband's victims, I'd want
to have him killed.”

——Jane Hamlin, whose husband, Carl Hamlin, was ‘
arrested for three sexual assaults in Pittsburgh last
Tuesday and has a history of sexual assaults.

Affirmative action worthwhile

The Jan. 25 editorial titled
”Racial-based quotas should get
the axe” shows the prevalence of
ignorance surrounding affirma-
tive action policies. At the center
of the misconceptions is the fear

LETTERS I

that minority quota systems are a
threat to employment or business
opportunities for whites. We
have yet to see the staggering rise
in the employment rate of minori-
ties at the expense of whites to
account for this paranoia. No
white people are being hurt by
quotas. In fact, though African-
Americans have been the stron-
gest proponents for affirmative
action, they have benefited [less]
from it than have white women.

Another myth ‘about affirmative
action is that it places race or sex
before qualifications. Affirmative
action is not an argument against
hiring based on merit, but it takes
into consideration that minorities
have systematically been denied

the means of achieving that merit, ~ '

and often the means of measur-
ing mérit is biased. It is [impossi-
ble for a minority to earn seniority
if 15 years before, the firm for
which he works didn't hire
minorities. [...] '
Affirmative action seeks that a
reasonable amount of the pool
[of] qualified minorities and
women be given access to oppor-
tunities. The subject of the
editorial, Richmond's ”set-aside"
policy which [was] laid waste by
the Supreme Court recently, was
a policy in which city contractors
were required to offer 30 percent
of its subcontracts to minority-run

 businesses. What is hardly men-

tioned is that that policy offered
a waiver if the requirement- was
not fulfilled due to a lack of quali-
fied minority subcontractors. I
mention that to say that quota sys-
tems do not ”send employers
scurrying to find minorities to fill '
jobs.” Quotas and set-asides are
set to‘ secure the employment of
a reasonable amount of the pool
of qualified minorities.’ To make
sure that qualified minorities are
given an equal chance, these goal
systems are determined based on

an analysis of the numberof .

available skilled women and
minoritiesiin the job market and
their [skill levels; In a city’. like
Rich_rn"o_nd, I.-where’ "minority-run

bus_inessesJare“few and most..ar'e.,‘

YOU, 3

 

very young, it is difficult for
minority contractors to compete
with the more well-known con-
tractors no matter how qualified
they may be.

. A badly aimed shotgun

Mario O|iverio’s anti-abortion
piece in The Pi'tt‘News [Ian. 30]
was one of the most dogmatical-

ly reasoned, ill-written pieces I

have ever had the pleasure (?) of
reading. First of all, Mr. Oliverio,
you skirt one of the most impor-
tant issues in the entire abortion
debate, that of the ’’personhood’’

, of the fetus by including the

phrase, ”future children's bod-
ies,” in your first paragraph. This
assumes that the readers of this
article share in your beliefs

I (which many donot) and that you

will convince anyone with any
clarity of reasoning at all with this
kind of shoddy intellectualism
(which you will not). To avoid
discussing this issue shows only
the most profound of intellectual
cowardice. ’ -‘

After this initial blunder, you
travel blithely further down the
road of unreason, attacking a
presidential cabinet member, The
Pittsburgh Press, the women
demonstrating in support of the
right to [have] an abortion, and fi-
nally a _I 3 year old for the audaci-
ty to have a view on an issue
which ”to be completely neutral
on  is to be neutral on your own
life.” Come on, Mr. Oliverio, if
s’oon-to-be-college-
educated male, can't reason
clearly, why should she, a child
who probably hasn't entered high
school, have to do so? As for her

' immaturity, so what —— she. is only

I 3. .
Further, if’ the women
demonstrating for their right to an
abortion are fanatics, at least they
do not bomb those who disagree
with them, as do some ’.’pro-
lifers." I'd rather a person hold a
sign or a coat hanger in demon-

Starting a nuclear confrontation by remote control

The president has a new car.
He rode in it just after his swear-
ing—in on Inauguration Day.
News commentators gushed over
its capabilities. As I understand it,
the custom—built limousine is bul-

ART
BUCHWALD

K let-proof, dust-proof, has tilted

seats, a smoke producer, a loud-
speaker, a bar, a large—screen tel-
evision, a kitchen (capable of
cooking a meal for 40), a Jacuz-
zi, a steam room and a squash
coun.

What_frightens me the most
about this car is something Dan
Rather said. He mentioned that
the limo, and I am not making
this up, was constructed in such

a way that the president could

conduct a nuclear war from it.
If true, this is very worrying.
I can just imagine the scene
where the car salesman briefs the
president on the features of his
new automobile.
"Now, Mr. President, this but-

ton here controls the tempera- ~

ture, this one opens up the roof,
this is the light dimmer and this
one launches every ICBM in our
stockpile.”

’’I see. Let me get it straight —
this button opens the roof."

"No, sir, that's the temperature
gauge. The one that operates the
roof is next to it."

"I see. Then this button dims
the lights."

"No, that one launches the
nuclear missiles. The light dim-
mer is over here.”

The handwriting is on the
abortion clinic wall. Roe vs.
Wade, the landmark Supreme
Court decision of 16 years ago
[last] week which ushered in
abortion on demand, could be
on its way to the legal dustbin.

Nearingtheend of
legalized abortion?

at CAL

’ THOMAS

The "smoking gun” in the
case against Roe has come in
the discovery by Washington
Post reporter Bob Woodward
of memos exchanged by
Justice Harry Blackmun, who
wrote the majority decision,
and Justice Potter Stewart. The
two 1972 memos reveal how
shaky _was the foundation of
medical and legal thought on
which the decision was based.

.Woodward discovered in
the files of the late Justice Wil-
liam O. Douglas that Black-
mun wrote to Stewart, "You
will observe that I have con-
cluded that the end of the first
trimester is critical. This is ar-
bitrary, but perhaps any other
selected point, such as quick-
ening or viability, is equally ar-

-' bitrary.”

Responded Stewart,
wonder about the desirability
of the dicta being quite so in-
flexibly 'legis|ative.’ ”

Arbitrary? Legislative? Isn't
this what pro-lifers have said
of the Roe vs. Wade decision
for‘ 16 years?

‘ Abortion proponents began
by setting the rules for the de-
bate. Now that they seem to
be losing, they say the rules
don't matter. Abortion on de-
mand, they say, should
conﬁnue. ,

In commenting on the Rea-
gan administration's successful

. effort to get the Supreme Court
to hear’a Missouri case which

III

tion of abortion, a Los Angeles
Times editorial acknowledged
that Roe vs. Wade ”was
pegged not to the text of the
Constitution but to vague con-

' the Reagan administration and

could include a reconsidera- ~

cepts of liberty ‘and, privacy.” -

A. similar argument by
Robert "Bork about the absence
of a specific right to privacy in
the Constitution was enough
to deny him a seat on the
Supreme COUIT.‘

Continued the Times editori-
al, "The scientific basis for the
decision has become shaky as
medical technology has made
it possible to save smaller and.
smaller babies.”

Yet the Times is not about to
allow facts to get in the way of
liberal thinking: "Whatever-
the shortcomings of Roe vs.
Wade, the justices should ig-
nore the zealous pleas from

the state of Missourito over-
turn’ it." " '

But significantly, public
opinion is begining to change.

Tom Smith, director- of
general social surveys for the
National_ Opinion. Research
Center in Chicago, reports that '
since 1984 therelhave been
significant declines in support

for legalized abortion: ”We- *

have looked at it [the research]
to make sure it is reliable, and
there has been a decrease in
support for legalized abortion
in all  circumstances we ask
about”

In many cases, pro- V
abortionists have been able to
maintain the status quo by
keeping women ignorant of
the details of abortion and the
physical, emotional and psy-
chological effects that accom-
pany it. Increasingly that
information is becoming
available.

Faced with such opposition,
pro-abortionists are reacting
frantically, taking out full-page
newspaper ads featuring coat
hangers, suggesting that the
bloodied-«corpses of women
who havéhad illegal abortions
will be’ "littering back alleys '
again if Roe is overturned.

It: is increasingly evident that
the pro"-choicers' case has '
been punctured —- medically I
and legal-ly —— and may run out
of breath.

"Why can't the nuclear button
be seperated from the others so
I don't get them mixed up?"

"That would have added to the
cost of the car, and the budget
planners felt that since you would
be using the nuclear button so
seldom, it wasn't worth the
money.”

"What's this button for?"

”With that, you can either start
a conventional war or roll down

- your windows.”

"Do you think that's the best
place for it since my grandchil-
dren may be riding in the car?"

"If we put it higher, it could get
confused with the stereo buttons.
There was some talk of installing
it in the glove compartment, but
then It would be hard to reach
from the back seat."

’'I am pleased to have such de-

terrent capability in my car, but
what kind of signal are we send-
ing the Soviet Union when half
the controls in the back can start
a war?” '

"It was the ClA's idea. They
told us that Gorbachev's limo has
been equipped with four SS20s
on the exhaust pipe, and that they
are aimed directly at the United
States.”

"Well, all right. ‘How do I
receive the signal to launch my
nuclear weapons?”

"It will come over this country
music station. We're assuming
that you will be listening to coun-
try music whenever you are be-
ing driven to and from the White
House. As soon as you hear the
announcer say ‘a kinder, gentler
mushroom cloud,’ you'll push
the button."

"This one?”

"No, sir. That button is to
defrost the rear window.”

"I'll get it right. What happens
if_| push this one over here?”

"That turns on the car's flame
thrower in case you're caught in
a traffic gridlock.”

"You people have thought of
everything. I imagine that this
button must be important."

''It could be the most important
one in the car. It activates the ra-
dar detector and warns you about I
every speed trap the police have.
set up on any highway in the
United States.” . ' V

BOFFEMMYER

Though many people walk
through the doors of.our office

. every day, very few crawl in. _

A little baby has been visiting
uslately. One of our reporters is
writing an article about her and
her parents. She's adorable. We
allsit and play with her while
she's here. 4

She's got blond hair and blue

' eyes. She's alert and happy and

absolutely tiny. .
So,’ I've been thinking about
babies. I think they're great.
‘ Iwatch all of the people whom
I work withevery day running
around, screaming and swearing
while they perform their respec-
tive functions for the paper.

Everyone is genera|ly,comp|ete— .

Iy caught up in putting the paper
together.

But when this little girl is
around, all eyes are on her. It's
really something to watch —
adults dropping the ”important"

work they have to do, all for the

. attention of a little baby.

A friend and I were discussing
this very phenomenon yesterday.
We were trying to figure out what
it is, exactly, that makes babies so
neat

This friend and I value writing I

poetry more than anything else
that we do. But we were saying
that to have a baby someday
would be even more wonderful
than all of the poems we've com-
posed piled together.

. We weretsaying, in fact, that
we'd give up the lives that we're
planning for ourselves right now
—— the whole starving artist bit —
and play responsible roles, with
real jobs and everything, to have
kids of our own someday.

That sort of willing sacrifice
amazes me. And the fact that my
parents did it, the fact that it has
been going on for centuries,
amazes me further still.

I guess there's just nothing so
valuable as life. It's worth
everything. , ‘‘

Yesterday, Mario Oliverio said
in his column that "the right to
life must be protected above the
woman's right to have ‘freedom
of choice.’ " Let's talk about a ba-

Staff Writer

Date rape will be addressed
tonight during the third Our
Choice program to be spon-
sored by the Inter-Fraternity
Council and the Panhellenic
Association during this aca-
demic year.

”People don't really know a
lot about  where the bound-
aries lie,” said IFC President
Jim Venturella. _

Our Choice stands for Our
Concerns Harboring Over In-
creased Campus Education. It
was founded last term as a

way to educate Pitt Greeks, as
well as all university students,
about important social issues,
such as AIDS awareness,
drinking responsibility and
tonight's topic, date rape.
According to Venturella, all
of the Our Choice programs
were well—received. ”We
haven't had trouble with atten-
dance,” Venturella said. The
first two programs drew au-
diences of over 200 people.
He expects this one to be the
most effective program so far.
Originally, Our Choice was
developed to reach the Pitt
Greeks but has always been

open to the entire student
body. Venturella said that
while fraternity and sorority
pledges are not required to‘ at-
tend, they are encouraged to,
and their attendance has not
been a problem so far.
Venturella said the program
addresses issues of importance
to college students and the
public in general. -

”All of these issues have
been in the news,” he said.

The topic of date rape was
chosen before it became a
prominent and publicized is-
sue, according to Venturella.

The ship carried a cargo of-07

PHILADELPHIA (AP) —— Col-
lege students who are prone to
stress, especially freshmen, can
avoid it by learning some simple
techniques,-‘ according to a Tem-
ple University psychologist. A

”The trick is to master these
techniques so that you can «fall
into them automatically when

- you’r_econfronted witha stressful
‘ situation," said Dr. Herbert J.

‘ counseling center.

Without any help, Horikawa

' "said, "Many people have'a'ten-

dency to wait until their lives are
totally out of control with stress
before they do something about
it.” ,
When happens then, he said, is

A that people ”make frantic efforts

to learn how to control their stress
which, of course, leads to just
more stress.” _ ‘

Glenn commented, ”I can't be-

dent to signup for recruiter inter-
views at the beginning of each
week, when job announcements
are posted on the center's bulle-
tin board. By that Thursday, a
schedule is made up with student
interview times,

There are several factors that
decide whether a student re-
ceives an interview. First priority
goes to students graduating in the
present term. Also considered are
the number of interviews a senior
has had up to that point.

”We try to keep it even,” Col-
lins said, ”so one person doesn't
have a lot more interviews than
another.”

Each student also receives two
high—priority schedules per
semester. They can be used to
help a student interview with a
company, even when there are ,
more than enough people signed
up for the available slots.

Sometimes an interview sched-
ule has open slots available after
the sign-up period. In this case,
a student can sign up for a ”free-
bie.” According to Collins, a free-
bie doesn’t count against a
student in figuring the number of
interviews received.

Once a student receives an in-
terview slot, it is his responsibili-
ty to show up at the scheduled
time. Only one no—show is per-
mitted, and that's with an apolo-
gy letter to the company. More

than one no-show, without ad— 0

vance notice, can result in dismis-

sal from the placement center.
Even if a student doesn't get an

interview with a particular com-

pany, the placement center fiir—
nishes resumes and delivers

cover letters to the company's
recruiters before they leave the
university.

With all these services availa-
ble, Collins said that ”any student
who begins a job search early in
the year and uses our services
will get a job much quicker than
other students will.”

Pitt senior Timothy Conigy, a
client of the placement center,
said, ”I think the placement
center is pretty well organized. It
seems fair, the way they distrib-
ute the interviews. They attract a
good variety of companies.”

”Not using" the placement

center would be foolish. Even if ,

your choice employers aren't in-
terviewing at Pitt, the placement.
Center can help you write an ef-
fective cover letter to reach
t-hem,” said senior Ken Riek.
However, some students have
opposing viewpoints. Senior bus-
iness major Larry Miller said, ”It’s
a good place to start your job
hunt. You gain -practical ex-
perience in interviewing, but the
chances of actually landing a job
seem slim, when you consider

. the large number of people inter-

viewing.” --

Continued from page 1
already certified in CPR to be-
come instructors themselves.
Interviews are presently taking '_‘
place, and those interested can
obtain information at the
Health Education Office locat-
ed in Holland South.

In addition to the CPR class-

es, the SHS also provides stu-
dents with various other free
programs. Among theseﬁare
classes in stress management,

abuse, nutrition and eating

workshops. Academic courses

Hockey

By john Labriola
Staff Writer

The Panther Hockey Club
retained its undefeated record
with a 10-4 win over the West
Virginia Mountaineers at
Golden Mile Ice Center on
Sunday evening.

The Mountaineers, 1-5-1 in
West Penn College Hockey
Association play, challenged
the league-leading Panthers
(8-4 overall, 8-0) throughout
the first two periods, trailing
only 5-4 as the third period got
underway.

But the Panthers, who had
surrendered two goals in each-
of the first two periods, decid-

club routs Mountaineers, 10-4

ed to steady their defense, and
consequentially brought an
unstoppable offense along.

Panther freshman center
Dave Koval notched his fourth
hat trick in the past five games
with 14:52 left in the contest.
Two, minutes later, Verne
Shavers shot got by WVU
goaltender Dan Hollis, who
was pulled after a Brian
Owens score two minutes
later.

BrianvWoyt scored to give
the Panthers a 9-4 lead at 6:16,
and Koval tallied his fourth at
1:23 to close out the scoring.

”We decided to tighten up
our defense, and our offense

exploded when [Koval] scored
seconds after the period be-
gan,” said senior left wing
John Carlins. ”From then on

_ there was no stopping us.”

Added defense captain Eric

, Anderson, ”Our defense was
a little sloppy at the net, but‘

we tightened up by the third
period. We have cut down on
our pena|ties,_which helped us
tonight.

”We had most of our men

on the ice and not in the box-,” .

Anderson said.

‘Despite the final score, the
Panthers had no easy time
containing the Mountaineers

in the first two periods. After
a game—opening score by Tony
Travato at 14:42, WVU
notched two consecutive
goals at 12:27 and 9:08 to take
a 2-1 lead, their last of the
game.

The Panthers roared back,
bringing the score to 4-2 on
goals by Koval and Shavers.

WVU scored two midsec-
ond-period goals to tie the
game 4-4 with 5:45 remaining
in the second period. Panther
freshman right wing Eugene
Barilla added his team's last
goal of the period at 1:16 to
give the Panthers a lead they
would never relinquish.

Hockey Notes:

ing east to take on the Apaches

three—game road trip

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

JAMAICA, NY —— At times it
looked like the Pitt Panthers were
doing all that they could to lose

"alast night's. game against St.

John's. _

They shot poorly (43 percent
from the field and 25 percent
from the charity stripe), couldn't
convert on many of St. John's 21
turnovers and, at times, looked to
be outmatched.

Yet, they didn't fold. They were

‘able to score the first 1 1 points in
overtime for an 85-81 victory be-

ﬁfore 6,008 fans at Alumni Hall.

”We were fortunate to get out
of here with a win,” Pitt Coach
‘Paul Evans said. ”Our big people
didn't play well in the first half,
but they made up for it in the se-
eond half. In the second half [Bri-
an] Shorter and [Bobby] Martin
played much better.” a
. The Panthers improved to 11-8
overall, 4-4 in Big East play. St.
John's dropped to 12-7 and 4-5
in the conference. -
Pitt forward Rod ‘_ Brookin
couldn't sink a jumper with five

a ‘_ seconds leftin the game, but that
didn't seemto bother the Pan-

thers during the overtime period.

They came out and did every-'

thing they didn’t do in the first

half and quickly jumped out to an.

84-73 lead before St. John's could
score a point, P ’

”Everybody wants to play well
for national TV,” said Shorter,
who had a game-high 20 points

to go with nine rebounds. ”We »
Q needed this win in a big way. In

the Big East we are struggling
right now..’,’ , . .

After a slow first half, the Pan-
thers scored quickly and took

their first lead of the game on a

Brookin layup just two minutes .

into the second half. But St.
John's wasn't about to roll over.

After trading baskets for awhile,
the Redmen suddenly came back

 to life. After a St’. John's timeout,

the. Redmen went on a seven

point run to take _a' 950-43’ lead,»
. A their biggest-of the.ga'me.’ 1

 

The St. John's defense was the
key to the run, holding the Pan-
thers scoreless for four minutes.

”We should have won,” St.
John's Coach Lou Carnesecca
said. ”We made a lot of mistakes
and-let Pitt stay in the game. We
did a lot of things to win the

game, and on. the other side off-

the‘ ledger, we did a lot of things
to lose it.” __
‘The Panthers really couldn't
bite into the lead untl late in the
half. .Then, thanks to a number of
St.’John’s miscues, Pitt cam roar-

ing back. First, guard Terrence

Mullin missed a wide open layup

and then fouled Darelle Portter. -'

Porter hit both ‘ensuing free
throws.

After that, St. John's Jayson Wil-
liams, who had a. team high 19
points and a game-best 13 re-
bounds, dunked the ball but was
called for walking.

Jason Matthews followed with
a Panther layup to tie the score
at 69. It. was touch and go from
there on out. _ p.

’-’It was loose balls and missed

. .free ‘throwsthat cost us the;

~ game,” Carnesecca'said. ”The7
gut reaction has to be replaced -
with intelligence. That is some.-

‘thing wehavle to learn.”
_ When all was said and done,
Pitt was not that bad off in the first
half; in fact, they really should
have been ahead. .,

The Panther defense continual-
ly stole the ball.from the Redmen,

but had a hardtime convertng_

those steals into points. During
one span, Pitt stole the ballfive
straight times but could only con-
vert one takeaway into a basket.
”We didn't do much in the first
half,” Evans said. ’

St. John's started the game off..”a“

fast,‘ winning the opening tap,
and Williams put them up 4-0 be-
fore -Pitt could catch its breath.
They stretched their lead to
eightpoints when guard Jason
Buchanan hit a jumper right in-
side the three-point line at the 15
minute mark. It looked like they

Football team tentatively set for  

Emerald Isle game in December

By Erik Kridle

Staff Writer

Diehard fans of Pitt football will
have to travel farther than ever
before next season if they want to
catch the Panthers’ every game.

Pitt administrators have tenta-
tively accepted an invitation to
take part in‘ the second annual
Emerald Isle Football Classic to
be played in Dublin, Ireland on
Dec. 2.

”As it stands right now,” said
Pitt atheletic director Edward Bo-
zik, ”we are going to Dublin, but
there are still a lot of contract de-
tails to be worked out.”

According to Jack Freeman, Pitt
executive vice president, the
event is being sponsored by a
group of Boston-based promoters
who had been noticing a ”grow-
ing interest in American-style
football” over the past several
years and decided to capitalize
on that interest. The first Emerald
Isle Classic was played by Boston
College and Navy. The second,

in December, will match Pitt
against Rutgers.

Freeman said the university
stands to come away from the
game with approximately
$300,000. ”The offer is very
financially attractive, about the
same as a small bowl game,” he
said.

The promoters will pay for all

record time of 2:22.21. She
also placed second in the 100
breaststroke and third in the

  THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, January 31, 1989

Doughty denieskthat Bucs don ’t want to win

By Alan Robinson

9 AP Sports Writer

General Manager Larry Dough-

ty denied Monday that a lack of

off-season trades and free agent
signings means the Pittsburgh
Pirates’ budget-conscious owners
aren't interested in winning.

Doughty, responding to criti-
cism by outfielder Andy Van
Slyke and several columnists that
the Pirates aren't willing to pay
the price to win, said, ”We’ve
been competitive with [wealthy
teamowners] Gene Autry, Ted
Turner, George Steinbrenner. 
To say we're not competitive is
a slander against us."

Van Slyke questioned whether
former GM Syd Thrift’s firing, af-
ter he traded forfour high-priced
players, and the absence of new
talent? mean the owners care
more about the bottom line than
their lineup.

The Pirates’ ownership consor-
tium has been reluctant to sign
big-ticket free agents since buy-
ing the then-financially troubled
franchise in 1985.

”I’m disturbed that I've read
the Pirates’ management isn't
committed to winning and sign-
ing players,” Doughty said.
”We’ve spent a great deal of
money [in the off-season] to com-
pete.  We signed four [poten-
tial] free agents and signed eight
of our 10 arbitration cases; and it
wasn't for peanuts, it was for
competitive money in a bull mar-
ket for free agents.”

Van Slyke, who is trying to
negotiate a three-year, $5.5 mil-
lion contract, ”made some com-
ments and innuendoes [about
money], but I’d hope he'd re-
evaluate his statements,” Dough-

'ty said. ”Our perspective is we

are trying to keep our players and
pay them fairly.”

The Pirates’ payroll, less than
$5 million only two years ago, is
expected to top $10 million in
1989.

”We are committed to win-
ning, and I'm disturbed when I
read that we're not,” Doughty
said. ”Some people are tearing
down the club even before the
season starts  but we are com-

"VVVVVVVVVV-vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvq

mitted to a strong club.”

The Pirates lost free agent
pitcher Dave LaPoint, who
signed with the New York
Yankees, but signed potential free
agents Junior Ortiz, Gary Redus,
Bob Walk and Glenn Wilson. Of
10 possible arbitration cases, the
only unsigned players are Van
Slyke and pitcher Bob Kipper.

Doughty is ’’hopeful  but op-
timistic may be too strong a
word” that Van Slyke, The Sport-
ing News’ 1988 National League

Player of the Year, will sign a

multiyear contract. before his
scheduled Feb. 20 arbitration
hearing.

The two sides have agreed on
money, but Van Slyke wants to
be paid if the owners lock out the
players in 1990. The Pirates have
refused to include a lockout
clause in his contract and have
offered ”neu'tra| Ianguage,”
meaning an arbitrator would de-
cide if Van Slyke would be paid
during a lockout.

Van Slyke has warned he will
sign with another club in 1990 if
Doughty and the Pirates don't

sign him to a new contract and
he goes to arbitration.

’’I’m hoping he signs for three
years and is here for 10 more
years,” Doughty’ said. ”I don't
think he'd go to another club [in
1990] just for more money. I
think Andy wants to be a Pirate.”

Pitcher Jim Gott, who is ap-
pearing in a week-long, team-
sponsored promotional tour that
began Monday, agreed Thrift’s fir-
ing shou|dn’t upset the Pirates’
off—field chemistry.

”A lot of ushad good feelings
about Syd, but we don't know
what goes on in the front office,”
he said. ”To us, Jim Leyland is
our manager and that's all that
matters to us. Syd is moving on
and Larry is moving in, and we
don't doubt the ability he has.”

Meanwhile, Doughty hasn't
given up on trading for a proven
shortstop but is resigned to begin-
ning the season ”with a shortstop
who won't hit .300, maybe one
who won't hit .260 or .250.”

Leyland plans to rotate.slick-
fielding but weak-hitting short-

stops Felix Fermin and Rafael Bel-

liard, and Doughty said former
starter Sammy Khalifa, who has
spent the last two seasons in the
minors, is another possibility.
”His bat is starting to come
around,” Doughty said. ”He
showed us some things last sea-
son.  He's made a resurgence.
He played as good a third base

in the minors as I've seen, but _

we'd use him at shortstop here.”

The Pirates, who finished 15
games behind the NL East cham-
pion New York Mets last season,
”aren’t going to make up those
games by ourselves; we've got to
have some help,” Doughty said.

”But we're a year older and
we're going to be a year better.
Maybe we can catch the Mets
halfway by making up seven or
eight games and hoping for some
help from the rest of the di-
vision.”

THE PITT NEVVS, Tuesday, January 31, T989

l Kimbail foundguilty
of manslaughter, gets
17 years in prison

By Pat Leisner
Associated Press Writer

TAMPA, Fla. — Olympic
diver Bruce Kimball was sen-
tenced today to 17 years in
prison for killing two people
and injuring four others when
his car plowed into a group of
teenagers last August.

The 1984 Olympic silver
medalist, who was legally
drunk at the time, must serve
an additional 15 years proba-
tion, Hillsborough Circuit
Judge Harry Lee Coe ruled.

”You must be punished,”
Coe told Kimball after the
2‘/2-hour sentencing hearing.
”You must suffer the conse-
quences of drunken driving,
and we must stop it.”

Kimball has been in jail
since earlier this month, when
he pleaded guilty to two
drunken driving manslaughter
and three great bodily injury
counts.

Today, he changed the plea
to no contest, a technical
move aimed at making it easi-
er for victims to recover
damages from his automobile
insurance company.

Kimball, 25, dressed in a
blue jail uniform, stood impas-
sively before the judge during
the hearing. He did not react

visibly when the sentence was
read.

Under state sentencing
guidelines, Kimball’s penalty
had to fall between seven and
22 years.

Coe, who also revoked Kim-
ball’s license, noted that most
prisoners serve only 20 per-
cent to 30 percent of their sen-
tences. Under those cir-
cumstances, Kimball could be
free in as few as three years.

Prosecutors said Kimball,
who had a blood alcohol
count of twice the legal limit,
was driving 75_ mph on a dark-
ened road near Brandon, just
outside of Tampa, on Aug. 1
when his car plowed into a
group of teenagers gathered at
a dead end. '

Assistant State Attorney John
Skye said Kimball ”was not
just a little careless, he was not
just a little negligent.”

The accident occurred while
Kimball was in training to
qualify for the 1988 U.S.
Olympic team. He was re-
leased on bond. Families of
the victims attended the
Olympic trials in Indianapolis
to protest his quest for a place
on the team. Kimball failed to

qualify.

was able to get within one point
when Brookin hit a jumper
around the eight minute mark.

The Redmen defense did a
good job of keeping the Panthers
at bay, though, and went into the
half with a 37-34 lead.

Shorter had a tough first half,
never getting into the flow, and

left the game when he commit-
ted his third foul at the nine
minute mark.

Yet, _Shorter was able to hold
on, not committing any fouls the
rest of the game to lead the Pan-
thers to victory.

”We mad a lot of stupid mis-
takes in the beginning,” Shorter
said. ”They shouldn't haveeven
been out on the court with is.”

Pirates tix
moving at

brisk pace

(AP) — The Pittsburgh Pirates, _

baseball's worst—drawing team
only four years ago, expect to sell
1 million tickets by opening day.

The Pirates have sold more
than 500,000 tickets, compared
to about 300,000 on Jan. 30 last
year, and expect to pass the mil-
lion mark by their April 11 home
opener against the New York
Mets.

The Pirates sold 913,000 tick-
ets by last year's opener.

”Usually, we see a lull in tick-
et, sales between the Super Bowl

and the start of spring training, '

but sales haven't slowed this year
and we're very encouraged,”
Senior Vice President Bernie Mul-
lin said Monday.
