Hospital Care
Begins With
Fee Payment

Students Must’ File
Applications with
School Treasurer

Actual protection for Univer-
sity students enrolled in the Pitt
News-Student Health Service
group ' hospitalization plan begins
this week. Collection of the
first semester’s fee, amounting
to $2.50, is payable in the treas-
urer’s office, State Hall.

Although the deadline for pay-
ment of the insurance fee is not
until October 1, Dr. H. C. Carlson
director of the University Student
‘Health Service today emphasized
the importance of an early pay-.
ment as he said: . '

“No student is protected under
the hospitalization plan UNTIL HE
HAS PAID HIS FIRST SEMES-
TER’S FEES. The signing of a
blue application card means noth-
ing unless it is now followed up
with the payment. I-"advise every
student enrolled under the plan to
take full advantage of i.t now, and
not delap, which may prove re-
grettable later. Why wait?”

Adding emphasis to the words of
her colleague Dr. Carlson, Dr. Au-
leene M. Jamison, director of the
Women’s Division of the Student
Health Service also stressed the
advisabilitty of Dr. Carlson’s “Why
wait?” suggestion as she stated:

“There is deﬁnitely a need for
such a plan as group hospitaliza-
tion at the University. The sooner
students take. active cognizance of
this need by protecting themselves
against the lack of suitable cura-
tive facilities in time of illness, the
easier it will be to maintain a high-
er standard of student health on
campus. It would be well if every
student were protected under the
plan. To pay your fees now, and
thus be insured for 21 daays of free
hospitalization is to take the step

toward the solution of a vittal sttu-'

dent problef.”

Service rendered to all paid-up 

enrollees of the hospitalization plan,
given free in time of illness upon
the recommendation of Dr. Carlson,
include:

(1) Room and board in. ward

accommodations for a total of 21.

days each school year in any of

Pittsburgh’s 25 largest hospitals." 

The student may select accommo-

dations in a semi-private or pri- _
vate room with an allowance" of $3

per day toward the purchase of
these better accommodations.
(2) Anesthesia as often as nec-
essary.
(3) Ordinary drugs and medi-
cations. «. ' '
(4) Use of the operating room
as often as necessary. I 1
(5) Necessary dressings and
casts. ‘ '
(6) Routine laboratory services.
(7) Ordinary X-ray.

Students to Relax
At First Social ‘A
Wednesday

After the three-day grind of the
new semester, the College Associa-
tion offers students a chance to
relax their jangled ‘nerves at the
annual Howdy Hop Wednesday aft-
ernoon in Hotel Wester Hall Im-
perial room.

The dance, running from 2:30 un-
til 6 o’clock, will feature Rusty
Williams and his orchestra, and the
admission will be 25 cents.

As an extra added attraction, the
committee offers the ﬁrst oppor-
tunity for our-—men-about—campus
——to introduce themselves to the
famous “green armband brigade,”
terror of the upperclass woman’s
heart. '

Quickly following up that ﬁrst
advantage, the CA’s Kick-Off dance
is scheduled for Friday night, Oc-
tober 4, at the Hotel Schenley ball-
room. Neil Buckley and his or-
chestra will be the visitors on
campus that night before the Mis-
souri game. Mr. Buckley, you will
recall, was formerly vocalist with
the Don Bestor outﬁt. The time is
from nine until one.

Cheerleader Candidates
To Report Tomorrow

Dick Sonnenfeld, C41, chairman
of the cheerleaders has issued a
call for all candidates to report to-
morrow at 4 o’clock, at gate 3 of
the stadium. No previous experi-
ence is needed to be eligible for one
of the cheeleading jobs. William
Brinker will coach the cheerleaders
this year and he will be assisted
by Karl Oerman as tumbling coach.

  

Lifts Come
To Light"
And Life

By Jack de Benedictis

Things are looking up-—as far
as the elevator situation is con-
cerned.

For if somebody doesn’t catch up
with the electricians, the new dis-
patcher system on the ground ﬂoor
for the elevatbrs will be ready for
use in two weeks.

The dispatcher might not make
service any better, but think of
the fun you can have while whil-

ing away the idle hours of wait-
ing for a car.

A system of lights on a switch-
board follows each elevator on its
erstwhile passage up and down the
Cathedral. Just imagine that
blonde, who has been waiting ﬁve
minutes for a car, consoling her-
self by taking bets on whether No.
3 will beat No. 7 to the ground
floor.

In fact we predict the formation
of a gambling syndicate, probably
called University, Projects, Inc.,
which will organize daily pools,
sub rosa, of course. Then some-
time during the day, lunch time
preferably, the main event will be
run off. And if all the poolees can’t
get on the ground floor, messenger
boys can relay the results to "the
Commons Room Herd, to Tuck
Shoppe Society, and .in special
cases, to the Faculty Dining Room
habituees.‘ A

A private poll of elevator ope-
erators shows conclusively that,
though they haven’t yet been ap-
proached by any syndicate, they
might consider throwing a few trips
if their palms were crossed ac-
cordingly.

Incidentally, if the new system
does make the service smoother
and faster, we won’t have to give
the Freshmen our usual advice—
namely, that as far as the Univer-
sity elevators are concerned, pati-
ence isn’t a virtue, it’s .a career.

Introduced

To Pitt at Lantern Night

One of the oldest traditions. of the University will be continued this
week, when freshman women participate in the twenty-ﬁfth Lantern
' Night ceremony Wednesday evening.

 The ceremony, under the direction of :_‘:Martha Wandrisco, C42, chair-

man, of the WSGA traditions committee,-:‘ formally introduces freshman ,

women to life at the Universitty
and “by the symbol of light, in-
tends to create thought, feeling, and
desire for spiritual light of knowl-

 edge and wisdom which the Uni-

versity fosters.”

For the second year, the program
will be divided into two parts—-
the pageant in the Stephen Foster
auditorium and the procession with
lighted" lanterns on the quadrangle
before Heinz Chapel.

« In the ﬁrst part, caalled the
Passing on of the Lanterns, Miss
Wandrisco will explain to the fresh-
men how the ritual was adapted
from the Chinese feast of the lan-
terns celebrating the new year.
Senior Queen Mary Gregg will pre-
sent the lanterns to the girls, and
after a speech of welcome, Father
Pitt, played by Harriett Glasser,
C41, Chief Justice of the senior
court, will lead the procession to
the quadrangle.

_ There they will be presented to
Alma Mater, Mary Ruth Hosey,
E-d41, president of WSGA, who will
give the order for the lighting of
the lanterns on the altar of Truth.
After a procession around the lawn
with the junior class, sister class to
the freshmen, they will be led into
the Commons Room through the
“gate of eternal youth.”

Commuting Students Pay Special

Students who commute from
points beyond the city limits of
Pittsburgh will be charged a special
fee of three dollars per year for
borrowing privileges in the Carne-
gie Library.

The library’s lending department
explained that the heavy demand
for books made by out-of-town
borrowers could no longer be han-
dled without inconveniece to the
holders of resident cards.

,“The Carnegie library of Pitts-
burgh is a public library, maintain-
ed exclusively by city taxes for the

Fee for Use of Carnegie Library

free use of all residents of Pitts-
burgh,” the notice reads. “But,” it
goes on to saay, “students who re-
side within the city limits of Pitts-
burgh during the school year will
be given free borrowers’ cards upon
presentation of their University
registration cards.”

Student commutors are expected
to use the library facilities of the
city in which they live, or, if they
are not complete enough to supple-
ment the University library, to pay
the new fee.

For the summer session only, the
charge to non-residents is one dol-
lar. '

Calls Fledglings

CAA Students
Meet Today  

. In a letter addressed to students
interested in the Civil Aeronautics
Authority ground and ﬂight train-
ing course, E. A. Holbrook, dean
of the School of Engineering and
l\/lines and chairman of the Univer-
sity committee, calls for a meeting
of those who want to take the
course in 202 State Hall this after-
noon at four o’clock. A A

Full instructions and. regulations
governing the couse, provided for
under the CAA program for pilot
training, will be given at that time,
the letter states.

Dean Holbrook’s letter follows:

“To the Student Addressed:

“Some weeks ago you made in-
formal application for enrollment
in the University of Pittsburgh
Civil Aeronautics .ground and
flight training course for this
semester.

“Last week the Civil Aeronaut-
ics Authority notiﬁed us that cer-
tain regulations‘ and conditions

forefibut to wait until we knew 

what the new conditions were to
be.

“It now appears that we can give
you full information about the
course. If youare still interested,
please come to a meeting at 4:00 p.
m. on Monday, September 23, at
Room 202 State Hall. '

“I wish to inform you that un-
der the new program there will be

Also, if you are under age, you
must have your parts written con-

sent on the application blank which
we shall furnish. '

“Also, you must sign a state-
ment which includes the statement
—“I pledge myself to apply for
ﬂight training in the military
training of the United States.”

Very truly yours,
E. A. HOLBROOK,
‘ Chairman.
The clause-‘in the-statement to be
signed by applicants for ﬂight -train-
ing which states that the trainee
will “apply for. ﬂight training in
the military service of the United
States” in effect excludes women
at the University from taking the
course, Dean Holbrook declared.
Copies of the new rules govern-
ing the training program can be ob-
tained at the meeting todaay.

ROTC Registrations

Soar over Allotment

Number of Enrollees Exceeds

School Quota by 1744

Spurred by the national emergency and recent enactment of
the Selective Training and Service act, enrollment in ROTC mili-
tary service courses has reached unprecedented totals.

Enrollment last Friday afternoon reached 1203 men, accord-
ing to ﬁgures released by Colonel Ralph XV. Wilson, professor and

head of the department of mili-
tary service and tactics.

Registration in the Coast Ar-
tillery Corps, however, exceeds
total authorizations by 144. For
the school year 1940-41, alloca-
tions by the_ War Department
amount to only 698 in the basic—
freshman and sophomore-—-course,
and 133 in the advanced-—junior
and senior-—course.

Excess Registrations

So far, 493 freshmen and 306
sophomores have registered in the
basic course,‘ an excess of 99 fresh-
men. 101, juniors and 77 seniors
have registered for the advanced
course, an excess of 45 juniors. If
the University ‘-authorization is not
increased by the War department,
144 students will be eliminated.

All ROTC schools in the country
must report before October 5 the
number of excess students who
have registered for military train-
ing. Pending any increase in
quotas by the War department
after October 5, Colonel Wilson is
meanwhile authorized to tentative-
ly enroll all men who have regis-
tered and met the physical qualiﬁ-
cations.

For the ﬁrst time in ROTC his-
tory, incoming freshmen must pass
a rigid physical test. “We are
primarily interested in training
men for a four-year course, result-
ing in graduation as a commission-
ed oﬁioer,” Colonel Wilson explain-
ed, ,“there is no sense allowing a
physically unﬁt student to com-
plete two years of ROTC, ‘only "to
be disqualiﬁed from entering his

...third..year becausehe cannot. meet-

the Regular Army physical quali-
fications for commissioned officers.”
Stiffer Physical Exam- " ‘ ‘

Because of the physical qualiﬁ-
cations, almost 25 % of all fresh-
men who have applied for enroll-
ment in military science have been
rejected. If an increase in the
University quota is not granted to
accommodate the increased enroll-
ment, the surplus freshmen will be
eliminated by -giving the entire
freshman class a more strict physic-
al test.

Colonel Wilson meanwhile has
repeatedly communicated with the
War department concerning an in-‘
crease in University allocations‘.
“Pending any furtherdecision, ac-
tivities will carry on as usual,” the
Colonel assured, “but we do not
wish to deny military training to
any physically ﬁt, eligible men.”

As expected, all four classes of
ROTC have exoeededlall previous
enrollment ﬁgures. “Thesituation
at Pitt is much the same as at Car-
negie Tech and Duquesne.” The‘
largest A increase has been in the
third year, where the enrollment
almost doubled over last year. Ex-

News Publishes First Edition
0f Unofficial Pitt Dictionary

(It should be understood that
this is not an attempt to replace
the Compass or Vadc Mecum as a
guide tothe iUnive'rsity, but only
as a supplement to those valuable
little reference books. Iferein, the
News shall attempt to deﬁne and
to explain a. few terms which the
freshman may encounter these next
few weeks.——Ed2'to7'.)

To the average freshman, there
are a number of ways and means
afforded to explain University whys
and wherefores. Neither your ori-
entation classes nor Brady’s hand-
book, not even your upperclass ad-
visers can explain everything. Thus,
the Pitt dictionary.

Around campus you may hear a
man referred to as a BMOC. That
means, simply, that he is a Big
Man On Campus, a guy who has
made ODK, Pi Tau Phi, or a couple
of letters. The female of the BMOC
is the BWOC. That can be taken
either way.

Druids (pronounced Droowidz)
are a group of sophomore men who
have been recognized for their ex-
cellence in activities and, incidental-
ly, their work for either the fra-
ternity or independent parties. They
may be identiﬁed by the black
sweaters surrounding gold emblems

which they occasionally wear, or‘
by the earnest looks on their faces.
The Druid builds its nest on the
eighth ﬂoor, although the more do-
mesticated specimens may be found
sipping cokes in the Tuck Shoppe.
Tops among activities men and
women are the members of Omi-

- cron Delta Kappa and Mortar Board,

respectively. ODK men can be
found nearly everywhere and are
identiﬁed by the single-breasted
suits they wear. Strung along their
vests is a silver or gold chain from
which is suspended a gold key, the
envy of all activities men. Mortar
Board members wear mortars only
occasionally, but do have pins with
that insigniaa.

The w-ord “blueprints” has been
used to lend credence to the rumor
that all freshmen will be required
to enlist in a classroom-—plastering
drive. Let us assure you that the
blueprint, in its milder forms, is
nothing more vicious than a glori-
ﬁned, technicolor report card. Each
blueprint contains the complete
scholastic record of the student, re-
vealing everything but the approx-
imate number of calories in his Sun-
day dinner.

Conversation Piece

To keep up with the changes in the world
political and economic situation, University stu-
dents and faculty members should supplement
their academic courses and academic classes with
forums and discussions.

The changes taking place in America and in
the world affect more than any other group, the
youth of America. That’s us.

These changes are not scheduled for the dim,
distant future.

Conscription is an alteration going to come to
many young men next month; to college men, next
July. Other changes wrought by the national de-
fense program are setting in.

VVl1ere is this year’s college student going to
ﬁt into the picture a year from now? Shall he
plan to re-enter school for another year, or shall
he decide that this year is the last college year—
for a time?

Assuming that the United States exempts itself
from actual combat from October 16, 1940 until
the same date in 1941—and this is purely an as-
sumption——what’ effect will the release of 900,000
men back to private life make upon us college
students now making plans for the future?

Next October, in the eyes of the employer, will
a job seeker, backed by the United States gov-
ernment with a year’s military training, have a
better recommendation for the job than a college
‘graduate backed by the University a11d the official
diploma?

Shall the university student of today make
deﬁnite plans to enlist next year or shall he post-
pone making plans till “that day” comes‘!

To keep up with these changes; to attempt to
“be in the know,” is just as important a job for
this year’s college student as going to class.

A program of open forums and discussions on
this subject should be promoted.

This summer, a group of University professors
organized among, themselves a Current Affairs
Seminar. They discussed before students, current
aﬁairs; the progress of the war; American poli-
tics; domestic American problems. This should
be continued and enlarged this fall.

We recommend that such loosely coordinated
organizations as Inquiry Forum, Men ’s Debating

Association, Women’s Speech Association, Inter-,

national Relations Club, and Peace Council get
together and develop a ﬁrst‘ rate program-—such
a program not to be limited to members only, but
open‘ to the expression of querying lay students as
well."

Current Comments  
Atlee, Streit, Lindbergh?
—-A nd the ‘A nschluss’

By Edgar Beige!

Latest brainstorm of the warlorn British govern-
ment was a revelation in the House of Commons last
week that “Prime Minister Churchill is prepared to
give full opportunity for debate on any proposal for
union between Great Britain and the United States.”
The question was planted in Parliament by the power-
ful British Labor party, by its war cabinet leader,
Major Atlee.

Proposal .for anschluss between the U. S. and Great
Britain is nothing new. University debaters talked
about it, three years ago. Clarence Streit talked about
“Union Now” in Stephen Foster Memorial last Novem-
ber. As an anti-climax to the recent secret naval base-
destroyer deal with the U. S., this latest British gesture
suggests that University history students may soon be
learning how the American Empire won the World
War of 1939-41.

‘As long ago as 1781 the ﬁrst U. S. Constitution pro-
vided for anschluss with Canada. Canadian radicals
have been talking about it ever since. Recently Colonel
Lindbergh adopted the idea as part of his corallary to
the Monroe Doctrine. But so far the U. S. has been
imperialistic in a quiet sort of way. This new British
proposal however has been sprung on the U. S. public
wel.l camouﬂaged by air raid headlines; experts say
it’s “nothing serious.”

The British government takes this super-anschluss
so serious, however, that they tried to pull the same
thing on the French last June, before France dropped
out of the war." Anschluss between the U. S. and
Britain would mean automatic entrance into the war;
a common army, -navy, and air force; pooling of all
industrial and monetary resources; common citizenship
and freedom of travel between the two countries.

Today this whole idea is repulsive to the average
U. S. public opinion. But a year ago Congress refused
to repeal the arms embargo; and only six months ago
compulsory military service was taboo in the U. S.
mind. In a few months, with a few nods from Wash-
ington, Anglo-American anschluss should make good
after-dinner conversation.

Lecture No. 1: Advice
To the Little Greenies
By Robert D. Hamilton

’Tis not so many years since we were a freshman,
so we can sympathize with what goes on in the murky
small minds of the Little Green Unplucked. Wherefor
this column.

Taking advantage of our position among the social
outcasts who write for the News, we are therefore go-
ing to expound words of wisdom designed to save the
poor frosh from a few of the many pitfalls that line
his crooked path.

With which introduction we herewith present the
ﬁrst edition of Hamilton’s Advice to Freshmen, volume
1, number 1.

War Is Better Than Gym!

First we address the boys taking military science.
You poor lads are.on the horns of a dilemma. Your
problem is to be good enough at drill that you don’t
ﬂunk out of college and get taken in by the draft
board, and at the same time remain bad enough so
that you won’t get promoted into the army. A sad
case, only to be solved by taking the dilemma by the
horns and living clean, boys, living clean. You can take
comfort in the knowledge that even being killed in
war is better than walking up to Trees Gym in the
winter. In war you get it quick.

Then there is the course every student must take,
Anthropology Lab IGG, designed to prove to the stu-
dent that the faculty are human. Most students ﬂunk
this course. Lab materials consist of a large hat pin.
This is to be secreted up the sleeve, and when one se<|
a particularly inhuman looking prof, he is to doubt
the evidence of his eyes, and, sneaking up behind said
prof, tickle him with an inch or so of pin. This will
produce much foul language, and, as every college
student knows, apes can do everything college profs
can except make profane remarks and“ go to war.

Abie Was Allergic To Tea!

The wise freshman will lay in a stock of false
mustaches and skin dyes, for use at the Commons
Room teas. By slipping behind a pillar and putting on
an Imperial and waxed mustache a freshman can get
Mrs. Miller to give him slathers of cookies and oceans
of tea. He can then change to another disguise and
repeat. This is very good when it comes to saving
lunch money. If one has large pockets and likes tea
and cookies he need not spend a cent on food‘ while
in school.

But alas, the plan has its drawbacks. We offer as
a case in point the sad tale of Abie O’Gurk, freshman
in ’36. Abie was hit by the depression, and to get
through college he had to give up eating for a‘ while.
Therefore he heeded the siren call of the teas and
laid in a stock of disguises. But one sad day, the
tears are running down my cheeks as I w-rite, Abie
drank one cup too. many of Mrs. Miller’s tea. Poor
lad, the doctors could do nothing. He turned green,
then lavender, swelled up like a balloon and burst
with a terriﬁc bang. You can still ﬁnd bits of Abie
stuck to the Commons Room walls.

Humility Leads To High Places

One last point. We counsel that you practice fall-
ing on your noses at home. Then when you meet a
Personage wearing an ODK key you can ﬂop with the
proper touch of humility and crawl backwards out of
The Presence on your knees, distributing sundry bows,
curtsies, and salaams as you crawl. This makes a good
impression on The Men Who Run Things,,and leads
to entree to the highest circles, both social and intel-
lectual.

 

Well, we have done our best for you now, and if-

bers could stand replenishing. '

Frosh Football

Tryouts Today

First Year Players
Study Fundamentals
Of University System

Any freshman reporting for foot-
ball this afternoon at gate three of
the Stadium will be given complete
equipment it was announced by
freshman coach Nick Kliskey. Pre-
vious experience is neither required
nor essential in order for a first
year man to report, it was pointed
out by the athletic oﬁice.

Since the adherence of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh to the rules of
the Western Conference prohibits
the competition of ireshman ath-
letes in intercollegiate athletics,
those frosh on the squad will have
to be content to spending their
first year learning the fundamentals
of the Pitt system. The decision of
Pitt oﬁicials to operate their ath-
letic code under the rules of the
Western Conference was reached
last year.

According to Coach Kliskey, this
year will differ from previous years
in that every aspirtant for the
squad will deﬁnitely be kept for
the entire season. The work of the

"coaching staff will be primarily to

drill the frosh candidates in the
ground work of the Panther meth-
od. Following this a four or ﬁve
team league will be formed depend-
ing on the number of students re-
sponding to the call.

Throughout the past few weeks,
invitations have been sent out to
all those men entering the Univer-
sity who have indicated iootb-all
experience on their entrance appli-
cation, thus leading to the predic-
tion that at least seventty-ﬁve can-
didates will report. Participation.
will not be restricted to those stu-
dents receiving letters, however.
Lack of football training in high
school need not eliminate anyone
since it must be remembered that
several past players have carved
admirable niches in Pitt football
history without ever competing in
high school.

The lack of freshman football
competition will not hinder Pitt
teams of the future to any great ex-
tent it was explained by the coach-
ing staff. Head of the football
board of brains, Charley Bowser,
said that three years of participa-
tion by any individual should pro-
vide plenty of hard football. The
first season should be devoted, he

stated, to getting the new players

acquainted to the Pitt system of
play. .

For the second straiglit year
the Pitt grid team goes into its
opening assignment as the un-
derdog when the Bowser-coacln
ed outfit battles a powerful
Ohio State eleven at Columbus
Saturday afternoon.

In last year’s lidlifter, Panther
fans will well recall, Charley Bows-
er’s debut found the local football
squad winning an aerial circus,
which included a transcontinental
sky journey to Seattle and some
brilliant air maneuvers on the grid-
iron itself. In that contest the un-
derdog Panthers soundly trounced
the Washington Huskies, 27-6.
Panthers Rated Lower

Saturday’s engagement ﬁnds the
Pittites rated even lower than they
were at the same date in 1939. The
dopesters were crossed up in their
promise of the ﬁrst opening day loss
in Pitt history, but they claim that
their unfulﬁlled predictions will
surely be realized this week.

Loaded with high-geared pigskin
machinery, the Buckeye roster
reads like an All-American check
list. Big Ten crown bearer from
1939. Francis Schmidt’s 1940 squad
lost but four regulars and is top-
heavy favorite to repeat despite the
shadow of Fritz Crisler’s Michigan
team on the title path.

Meanwhile, at Trees Field Coach
Bowser is putting his charges
through their paces twice daily. No
visitors have been allowed recently,
so Bowser may be planning a sur-
prise party for the Bucks Saturday.

Last spring his squad started out
minus seven ﬁrst team regulars and
eleven lettermen. Irreplacable gaps
had seemingly been opened in the
lineup. Physically the Panthers
were far from top shape, and rain
curtailed large portions of the prac-
tice grind.

However, fall sessions show a
rugged group of young pigskin war-
riors, every bit as big and possibly
as good as the 1939 eleven. George
Kracum. 20 pounds heavier than
last year, has displayed great poten-
tiality at fullback, a spot woefully
weak in 1939.

Bar-kﬁeld Setup

Big Ge0rge’s passing abilitv com-
bined with his added weight and
no perceptible loss of speed give
him all the attributes of a great
fullback. Another great passing arm,
that of Edgar Jones, promises to
c_ause many headaches to rival elev-
ens. The newly-christened “Regu-
lar Delivery” is also expected to do
plenty of mail carrying. He, too, is

‘Cl 1isel’s’ In for a Tough Time Again

Grid Team ‘Signs U for Suicide Schedule

By BILL McELWAIN
Sports Editor

If Charley Bowser can bring this
year’s football team through with
any kind of a respectable winning
record, the Pitt News wants to be
the ﬁrst to nominate “Chisel” ‘for
coach of the year. A, V _

It’s not that the Panthers will be
a poor ball club. They should be
much better than average. But
there is probably no eleven in the
country with a tougher schedule.
You would be hard-pressed to name
a half-dozen teams with schedules
equal to Pitt’s.

Dismal Picture

Just picture meeting seven out-
ﬁts who were included in the best
30 teams in the country, six of them

3 in the ﬁrst ﬁfteen. And then add a

clash with your deadliest rival.
That’s the picture for Bowser this
year.

The Jungle Cats will be deﬁnite
pre—season underdogs against Ohio
State, Missouri, Fordham, Southern
Methodist, Nebraska, and Duke.
Penn State and Carnegie Tech com-
plete the list.

Last year the Lions trimmed Pitt
for the ﬁrst time in 20 years. Ob-
viously, State‘ will be no pushover.
As every Pittsburgh fan, even the
most casual follower of the game,
knows, the Panthers have never
really swamped Tech. The Skibos
will give Pitt a battle, no matter
what kind of a team they have.

Playing Ohio State at all this
year would be no picnic, but open-
ing with them is just about un-
heard—of. Yet that’s what Pitt does
next Saturday at Columbus. Francis
Schmidt has a veteran squad and
few backﬁelds can match the Buck-
eye’s foursome of Scott, Langhurst,
Srasbaugh and Sweeney.

‘At Home’ to Missouri

Just to keep in the mood of
things, the Panther’s home opener
ﬁnds them meeting Missouri. All
Missouri did last year was win the
Big Six title and place Paul Chris-
nian on the All-American roster.
Cliristnizzn is back and even with-
out his pass catching ends, Roland
and Robert Orf, both of whom
graduated, the Dizzy Dean of foot-

ball is something of a one-man

‘ gang.

Southern Methodist drifts into
the Stadium for the third game and
the Mustangs are seen as the only
team capable of beating Taxes A. &
M. in the Southwest Conference.
SMU’s ball carrying quartet of
Malloy, Johnston, Clement, and Mul-
lenweg almost matches Ohio State’s
wrecking crew, and how those Mus-
tangs can whip a ball around!

Number four on the Pitt parade
is Fordham. The Rams look like
one of the East's best after a fair
year in 1939. Lou de Filipo and
John Kuzman are ﬁne linemen, and
backs Len Eshmont and Jim Blu-
menstock are looking forward to
their biggest. year yet.
Gruesome, Isn’t It? ,

After two successive open dates
and a three week’s gap during
which the Bowserites do nothing
but apply arnica and bandages the

Summer Months See Faculty
Changes

MakeUp, Cathedral

Work on New
Lunch Boom

Already Begun

By Betty Schoeller

After three months’ absence
from our University, several
students have already complain-
ed that they no longer recognize
the place.

Now We assure you that that
is gross exaggeration, but to put
your mind at ease and to reac-
quaint our bewildered friends with
the Cathedral, we have put down
here every important event of the
summer months.

Aside ‘from the impressive gate
which has beautifully served as an
obstacle to keep us from sneaking
into registration a day early, the
material changes are not startling.
Three nationality rooms were put
under construction and will be dedi-
cated in several weeks. They are
the Lithuanian room, the Italian
room, and the Greek room. The
22nd and 32nd ﬂoors have been
completed to house the School of
Applied Social Sciences and several
other ﬂoors are being rearranged
for changes in offices.

Physical Changes

But the big news is a secret, and
we shouldn't tell you, but behind
those iron doors on the Fifth ave-

'nue side Iofthe ground floor is a

bigger and better Tuck Shop under
construction. The room will. run
from the Fifth avenue stairs to the
Belleﬁeld stairs and will seat ap-
proximately three times as many
stuclents as the old one. Decoration
and food serving facilities will be
much on the same line as the Kathe-
dral Kitchenette. Building
Grounds department have threat-
ened nothing short of torture for
anyone who tries to ﬁnd out the
date of completion.

In case you haven’t been able to
see through the clouds of smoke
which make life in the Kathedral
Kitchenette miserable, there is an
enormous wall nlaoue on the
Forbes street end which vaguely re-
sembles a poll parrot.

Early in the summer, a remedial
reading laboratory found its way
to our 26th floor. Under the di-
rection of Dr. Gerald A. Ynakam,
professor of education, the labora-
tory enables teachers to diagnose
the reading difficulties of students
through the work of a machine
which photographs the movement
of the child’s eye as he reads.

too. Dr. Putman F. Jones, associate

professor of English, marketed his
