H. J. Heinz Company Invites
Faculty and Students to Great
Dinner Celebration on Mon-
day, Feb. 22.

ALL DAY TRIP PLANNED

Board of Control Tenders Vote
of Tha‘hks——Have Begun
Preparations “for Students’
Share of Celebration.

The H. J. Heinz Company has ex-
tended to the students and faculty of
the University of Pittsburgh an in-
vitation to make Monday, February
22nd, a big “Pitt: Day” at the Heinz
main plant on the North Side. This
invitation includes all the schools of
the university. The student senate
and the student board of control, act-
ing on behalf of the students, have
accepted the invitation, and arrange-
ments are now- under way to make
this day a big event in the university
calendar. vi

It is planned that the students will
assemble in the Administration build-
ing at the Heinz plant promptly at
11:00 A. M. At this time, a group
photograph of the entire party will be
taken. A large mounted copy of this
photograph will be presented as a
souvenir to every member of the party.
After the photograph has been taken,
a special luncheon will be served in
the Heinz auditorium. Arrangements
have been made for the Heinz lecturer
to give an illustrated talk covering
methods of pure food making. The
students will be welcomed by an
oﬂicial of the company, and Chancellor
McCormick, who has arranged to be
present at the occasion, will respond
with a short talk. The rest of the
afternoon is in the hands of the stud-
ent organization. Musical numbers,
readings» and a rousing session of
rooting are to be a part of the pro-
gram, the details of which will be
announced later.

At the conclusion of these exercises,
the entire party will be turned‘ over
to a reception committee, who will
conduct the students through the
various departments where the Heinz
pure food products are prepared. This
last part of the entertainment will be
both proﬁtable and highly enjoyable
to all members of the party.

To enable the company in its pre-
parations for the reception of the
students, next Friday morning, Febru-
ary 12th, registration cards will be
distributed at the student assembly.
It is requested that all, who expect
to make the visit sign these cards,
but those in charge of the affair, re-
quest that the cards be signed only
by those students who are reasonably
sure of attending. On account of the
expense involved, it is desirable to
make arrangements for as nearly as
possible the exact number.

The Heinz plant may be reached by
taking an Etna or Troy Hill car at
Federal and Penn, a Millvale or Spring
Garden avenue car at Seventh and
Liberty, or by taking any Penn avenue
car, getting off at Sixteenth street and
crossing the bridge.

EVENING MEN cLnsE  
FIRST TERM’S WORK

With the examinations ending last
week, the Evening School of Eco-
nomics ended the first half of
the work for the school year. The
past term has been the most success-
ful since the opening of the school.
The enrollment for last term was 475,
exclusive’ of a special class in banking
law, which has an enrollment of 180
students, and meets in the rooms of
the Pittsburgh Chapter of the Ameri-
can Institute. of Banking. This makes
a grand total of 655, a number which
is exceeded only by the evening courses
in the Universities of New York an
Pennsylvania. "

The work of the second semester
started Monday. Students will be
permitted to enter the course in
banking, journalism, business english,
advertising, accountancy of invest-
ment and sociology. If _the new stud-‘Y
ent has had previous instruction in
business law and the principles of
economics, he will also be permitted
to enter these courses. Registration
for 1the new term is being made this
wee .

MovING PICTURES
AT JOINT CHAPEL.

The wonders of Glacier Park were
presented in an excellent manner to‘
the students of the schools of econom-
ice and engineering at their joint
chapel exercises last Wednesday by
means of both steroptican and moving
pictures. An interesting lecture by
a man well versed in his subject ac-
companied the pictures and made the

exhibition one of the_ best ever given

RELIGIOUS ACTIVITY or UNIVERSITY 0120 WS

EonwANnllﬁvEMENI  
LAUNGHEI] MONDAY

The forwardmovement being con-
ducted by the Christion Associations
was opened at a large mass meeting
in Thaw hall last‘ Monday morning
when over three hundred students,
professors and ministers crowded into
107 Thaw to hear the discussions of
the religious and missionary cam-
paigns which the associations recently
formulated.

The meetingvwas opened with an
address by Chancellor McCormick who
Spoke on the three-fold work, abroad,
at home, and in the university itself.
He said that although we were greatly
handicapped for facilities at the pres-
ent time, preparations should be made
so that when the student building is
erected and a religious , secretary is
secured,- rapid’ progress could be
effected along these lines.

In comparing the work of other
institutions, Dr. McCormick read parts
of a report of the religious work at
the University of Pennsylvania, show-
ing among other things that $38,112.00
was given for the furthering of
missions in foreign ﬁelds.

Dr. Hugh T. Kerr, pastor‘ of the
Shadyside ‘Presbyterian church and

leader of the Pitkin Club, next spoke,

of his interest in the student life at
the university, especially through the
mission study class. He stated that
the critical place for service is not In
Europe" or Asia, but in America, and
spoke» on the splendid opportumty
which was available for the student

body. ‘AS a means of arousing inter--

est in the work, he suggested that a
campaign headed by John R. Mott,
Robert E. Spear or. Sherwood Eddy be
launched and he pledged his aid and
interest in such a movement.

George 0. Reemsnyder, the leader
of the meeting, next remarked on the
lack of cooperation of faculty and
student body; and said that because
there was no secretary this year, the
association was greatly handicapped
and expressed the appreciation of the
body for any suggestionsgand advice
which the faculty from time to time
might submit.

The social work was then brought
before the assemblage by J. S. Gow,

who said that the non-members re-E

sponded better than the members. He
also outlined several opportunities for
this kind of work.

Dr. C. C. Coyle, of the Belleﬁeld
Presbyterian Church next offered _a
suggestion that another day later In
the week be set aside for the religious
work. He spo.ke on the various diffi-
culties connected with Monday and
pledged the assistance of the ministers
of the city. Dr. A. J. Todd, head of
the sociology department remarked

that the faculty were never invited to‘

attend the cabinet meetings and sug-
gested that such an _invitation might

bring good results. Prof. A. N. Lucian‘

also emphasized the opportunity for

social Service, ’ especially here in
Pittsburgh. . _ _ _ ”

will be the topic for discussion next
Monday morning-at the regular meet-
ing of the Y. M. Cs» A.

CHEMISTS DISCUSS .
GLASS PROCESSES.

The lectures on Chemical Engineer-
ing given Monday evening, Feb. ﬁrst,
in 302 Thaw hall, were of the nature
of a Symposium on Glass.

Mr. Charles‘ H. Kerr "of the Pitts-
burgh Plate Glass Co. was unable to
be present because of illness.

Director Silvérman, of the Depart-
ment of Chemistry, spoke on the
“Manufacture of Colored and Clouded
Glasses,” illustrating his remarks
with specimens of the various glasses
discussed and drawing analogies be-
tween conditions in the glasses and
in ordinary aqueous solutions.

Dr. S. R. Scholes of the Mollon In-
stitute, spoke on the “Relation of the
Glass to the Pot.” Dr. Scholes dis-
cussed the manufacture of pots, their
dimensions, position in the furnace,
types of furnaces and the action of
glass on the pot walls.

A considerable number of glass and
pot manufacturers and professional
men were present and the meeting was
the best attended of any yet held in
the series.

RABBI

 

ADDRESSES
MENORAH SOCIETY.

Dr. Rudolph I. Colfee, Rabbi of the

Tree of, Life Congregation, spoke to —

the members of the Pitt Menorah Sol
ciety last Tuesdayxevening on “Why
I Should Remain a Jew.”

_Dr. oifee presented his argument
in ‘plain convincing manner which car-
ried the audience right with the speak-
er. In part he said that we should
study the Bible in the broadest light
possible so that we may have no fear
of a clash between religion and
science. He added that if any part
of our religion were to conﬂict with
science we should give up that part
of our faith. The speaker made it as
evident as he could that the Bible is
not to be taken literally but we should
understand its moral ‘teachings. It
was also made clear that the Jew
has much of his own trouble because
he is misunderstood.

The oﬂicers of the society are: Harry
J. Applestein, president; A. C. Hepps,
vice-president; Jerome L. Levy, secre-
tary-treasurer. The Executive Board
is composed of Mr. L. Sapper, H.
Franks and M. Heatter.

PAR'I‘ OF BIG MOVEMENT

Social Service Departments of
Christian Association Under-
take Large Work Among the
Working Men and Women.

By Prof. A. IN. Lucian.

The work of the Y. M. C. A. in the
University of Pittsburgh seems to be
a rather diﬂicult one in general and
in the ‘face of very tangible obstacles
the success attained and the results
,achieved are certainly worthy of ad-
A miration and praise. There is, how-
ever, one phase of the activities of
the Y. M. C. A., a very practical phase
indeed, which seems to be neglected,
or better perhaps, not taken earnest-
ly by the student body. I refer to the
industrial service work. This import-
ant activity was brought to the at-
tention of the University sometime
ago ‘in one of the assembly meetings
when the chairman of the Social Serv_
ice Committee made a forecful appeal
to the student body for their cooper-
ation in this supremely important
activity.

As a newcomer to the University,
the apparent lack of interest in this
unselﬁsh and fruitful Student activity,
caused me not a little surprise, espec-
ially when I Stopped to consider the
fact that the University is located in
this wonderful industrial ‘center with
its armies of foreigners, helpless im-
migrants and ignorant English-speak-
ing working men and women——-a ﬁeld,
the like of which can be found no-
where else in the country and perhaps
in. the world.‘ ~

And now, ﬁrst of all, every one will

work? It is not very easy _.to deﬁne,
for any deﬁnition in the sense that
deﬁnitions are ordinarily applied,
would cover only one aspect of this
multiphase problem." One could, how-
ever, withoutsgrave danger of contra-
diction, say in general terms, that In-
dustrial service Work comprises all
those phases of useful activity on the
part of College and University stud-
ents and all educated men toward the
betterment and broadening of the
social life of the great masses of the
Industrial workers of the country and
for the mutual beneﬁt and understand-
ing of both Student and worker. I
shall here attempt to sketch very
brieﬂy, the main features of this
movement, as I understand it through
what scant personal experience I had
at Yale and through the literature re-
ceived from the general secretary in
New York. I shall ﬁrst refer to a
paper on the subject read before the
American Society of Mechanical En-
gineers by Professor Joseph Roe, who
is one of the founders and the chief
exponent of the movement at Yale.
Although the paper is written for en-
gineers and engineering students, yet
its arguments and applications are by
no means restricted to that depart-
ment.of education alone. Here is a
short abstract of the paper. _
“A live work has sprung up in the
American Engineering schools in the
past six years, the object of which is
to bring students into friendly contact
with workmen and to develop a feel-
ing of conﬁdence and goodwill on the

AT STATE GDLLEGE

Responding to the invitation of the
Y. M. C. A. at State College to attend
the annual religious campaign this
week, J. D. Stark, Co. '16, H. N.
Mawhinney, Col., ’16, B. M. Lowther,
Col ’16, and C. A. Wagner, Col '18,
left for State College early yesterday
morning. -

This is the ﬁrst year that invitation
has been extended to outside institu-
tions; but great interest .'has been
manifested in the recipient, especially
since John R. Mott, president of the
international board of Y.\M. C. .A.’s,
and classed as “one of the world's
three more inﬂuential men,” will be
in charge.

Delegates will attend from all the
large eastern schools. Dr. Mott's son,
John Mott will head the Princeton
delegation which will

DEBATING TEAMS
FINALLY CHOSEN.

After many months of hard, active,
but quiet work, the debaters have

again emerged from their haunts with
the announcement that the - Pitt-.

Wooster-Allegheny debate will be held
March 12th. After an extensive
“weeding-out” process, the men who
will uphold Pitt’s prestige in the ﬁeld
of oratory have ﬁnally been determin-
ed upon: namely. W. C. Arthur.. Ec.
’17; C. W. Florence, Co. ’18; S. N.
Bazel, Col. ’18; Arthur Kornhauser,
Col. ’18; L.“ H. Criep, Col. ’18; and S.
A. Melnick, Col. ’18.

While these men have been chosen
for this annual triangular debate, the
above mentioned are not all the de-
baters. Three more men will be
selected to represent Pitt in the spring
debates with Westminster, W.- &. J.,
and State. A ‘co-ed’ team will also
be chosen to debate for honors with a
representation from Geneva. An-
nouncement of thefpersonnel of these
teams will appear in a later issue of
the WEEKLY. ‘ ‘

The Subject this year is: Resolved,
That the United States Should Initiate
a Policy of Increasing the Government
Responsibility of the Philipines to
Culminate in Independence by 1925.
Great interest has been shown by the
men in the ‘preparation of the Subject,
and the teams should be able to give
good accounts for themselves. .

The Allegheny team will come _to
Pittsburgh to oppose Messrs. Criep,
Florence and Melnick; while the Pitt
team composed of Messrs. Arthur,
Bazel and Kornhauser will travel to
Wooster.

It is interesting to note that the
Westminster teams have been elected.
They consist of Ralph Patterson,
Charles McQuiston, Lawrence Stewart,
Frank Orr, Arthur Jewell and Daniel
McQuiston. Which three of these will
oppose Pitt is not yet known.

“AL” HAMILTON NOW .
PRESIDENT OF P. A. A.

Alfred Reed Hamilton, '94, was hon-
ored at the annual meeting of the
Pittsburgh Athletic Association last
Monday night by being chosen presi-
dent for the ensuing year.

Mr. Hamilton is largely responsible
for Pitt’s great achievement in the
line of athletics, and for its great rep-
utation during the last few years.
“Clean athletics” has been his motto.
It was Mr. Hamilton who was instru-
mental in bringing about the one year
migratory rule which the Athletic
Council installed a few week ago.

NATIUNALSUGIETY
INSTALLS PITT BRANGH

The American Institute of Electrical
Engineers, a national organization, has
installed a "branch at the University.
This is the ﬁrst national organization
to establish a branch at‘Pitt. This
organization is made up of practicing
engineers and the student branches
are run in conjunction with the older
institute. About forty of the best

electrical engineering schools in the
country belong to this organization.

The ﬁnal organization meeting was
held last Thursday, January 21, with
a full attendance of Senior and Junior
Electrical Engineers. All students in
the department of electrical engineers
are eligible. The following oﬂicers
were“elected: chairman, G. W. Flaccus;
vice chairman H. H. Tinch; secretary-
treasurer, R. C. Zindel.

‘The ﬁrst regular meeting of the
branch will be held next week.
President P. -M. Lincoln, head of
Electrical Engineering department,
will be present and will deliver an
address. Prof. Lincoln is also Con-
sulting Engineer of the Westinghouse
Electric & Manufacturing Company.

The branch will meet every two
weeks. Its work will consist of the
presentation of original papers in
part and also the discussion of papers
presented before the national society.

 

CENSOR RESTRICTS
DANCE PROGRAMS.

Deleted by the censor and riddled by
the ultimatums of the faculty, the
program of the coed dance were but
the mere skeletons of their former
selves, but nevertheless the event
proved to be a great success. Under
the keen and Searching gaze of tho
chaperons, the girls donned the an-
cient dance styles of last year and
enjoyed themselves in spite of the loss
of the maxixe, the humbug and the
gravotte.

While the committee in charge was
adding the ﬁnishing touches to the
arrangements for the best coed dance
of the year, the members of the
faculty dropped the usual unexpected
bomb into the midst of those fond
expectations with their decree that
ail the more extreme of the modern
‘dances would not be permitted. In
spite of a stout resistance with both
tears and prayers, the rule held and
the dance was just a little bit old
fashioned. With the best possible
grace, the girls bowed to the necessity
and made the best of it—which best
proved to be quite suﬁicient. ‘

PROM ARRANGEMENTS
NEARIN G - COMPLETION.

Without exception the Promenade
of the class of 1916, will be the great-
est ever held in the University of
Pittsburgh according to the word
from the committee.

The students are responding nobly
and the patrons are adding the pres-
tige which patrons alone can afford.

The rules, as stated in an earlier
edition of THE PITT WEEKLY will
be religiously enforced. A

No tickets for admission will be sold
after six ofclock of Thursday, the day
of the Prom.

No ﬂowers will be permitted to be
worn. A special request is made for
those attending the dance to notice
and‘ apply this rule so that no em-
barrassing situation may arise.

No person, not connected with the
University is invited to attend.

If you have not completed your ar-
rangements for the Prom you will aid
those in charge by avoiding the rush
at the end of the stated time. Se-
cure tickets from your school repre-
sentation only.

“There has been an increase in at-
tendance in colleges and universities
in this country this year and if the
present period of ﬁnancial depression
proves Still more disastrous, the effect
will be to continue this increased at-
tendance'of students, at least until
lack of resources comes in to operate
in the opposite direction,” said Chan-
cellor McCormick in an interview this
week.

The Chancellor stated further in
connection with the efl'ect,of the war
on university attendance that in
Great Britain the attendance is about
forty per cent below normal and in
Germany and France much lower. In
answering this and other questions,
the Chancellor said that the answers
were necessarily speculative and in-
volved a large amount of pure guess-
work. _

The Chancellor continued:

“The effect of the war upon the at-
tendance of our own American stu-
dents is related to the question as to
how far the .-war will affect the
ﬁnancial situation of the country.
Past experience has demonstrated that
in periods of ﬁnancial depression in-
stitutions of learning are crowded
with students, because, thrown out of
productive employment, they seize the
opportunity of study, The present
period of depression_has been another
illustration of this fact, as the in-
crease, in the number of students

East and West-llias. demonstrated.

“Regarding the manufacture of
instruments, used so largely in the
scientiﬁc work in American institu-
tions, every facility has been offered
for their importation. How far the
manufacture of these instruments
may continue, one could not State with-
out more complete information as to
the actual facts. Most of these come
from Germany, and we are informed
that conditions in Germany are for
the most part normal. One would
infer that many skilled instrument-
makers are beyond the age of military
service, and therefore that the manu-
facture of such commodities would
continue at a moderate rate.

“In the matter of courses of study
in our\ universities, designed to pre-
pare young men for service in diplo-
matic and commercial affairs, one
would be inclined to. answer that
greater emphasis will be ‘put upon
them.‘ If it is impossible at this time
to foretell the termination of the war,
it is equally impossible to forecast
the situation which will be produced
by the war.’ At the same time, it
seems quite clear that one natural
result will be the closer relationship
of the two Americas. Every indica-
tion points to the fact that at this
time, by necessity, and later one, by
inclination, these countries will come
into a better understanding and a
more sympathetic relationshi than
has been possible up to this time. If

this prophecy is justified, it is quite

evident that the universities must
have a share in bringing it about.
Obviously, courses of study in lan-
guage, in history, in commerce, in
diplomacy, in literature, and in all the
subjects which have a bearing upon
the broad subject of our relationship
anal dmutual interests must be pro-
vi e .

“It is quite clear,_also, that a new

interest is now arising among the
people in‘ the subject of international
law, and in all the problems which
have an international bearing‘. These
and multitudes of other questions
will doubtless ﬁnd a place in the
curriculum of the university, and will
just as certainly ﬁnd a large body of
students thoroughly interested in
them.

“One of the most interesting things
at this time, when our hearts are so
strangely stirred by what is going on
in Europe, is to note the rapid pro-
gress our own people are making in
what we may call education in in-
ternational relationships. - America
must not only determine what will
be her policy as to the army and navy,
but what is to be her policy as an
inﬂuential world power. Bad as is
the war, and horrible as it is in its
work of destruction, it is accomplish-
ing, perhaps, many good things; and
our hope is that if it shall result in
the ﬁnal elimination of war, it will

even justify itself in its ultimate
outcome.” ' . .

At the regular meeting of the
Student Chemical ‘Society held in
room 302 Thaw hall, Monday, Febru-.
ary ﬁrst, Director Alexander Silver-
man of the department of chemistry
presented‘ the following plan which
was adopted by the society. ‘A com-
mittee was appointed to note all
necessary details for record in the
constitution and‘ on the minutes. The
plan is substantially as follows:

“That the name of the society be
changed to_the Chemical Society of
the University of Pittsburgh.” _

“That all Alumni in Chemistry and
Chemical Engineering shall be includ-
ed in the membership.”

“That Alumni be asked to ﬁle with
the society a copy of all publications
with miniature models.”

“That all members of the teaching
staff in chemistry and chemical en-
gineering and fellows in the Mellon
Institute shall be included in the
membership." ‘

“That there shall be one evening
meeting each month, instead of the
present morning meetings, so that all
almuni who desire may attend.”.

“That there shall be no assessment A

on any member of the society, but

scribe towards a fund to defray
expenses,‘ only that part of the
subscription to be called for which is
actually needed.” '

“That announcements of meetings
be sent to alumni.”

“That the president of the society
shall be a student in Chemistry and
Chemical Engineering.”

The alumni list has been prepared
by_ Dr. F. C. Phillips and notices are
being. sent every almnus who special-
Ized_in Chemistry while at the uni-
versity.

This plan will serve to interest the
alumni In the university and ‘enable
students to get acquainted with them.
From time to time papers will be
presented by the Chemical Alumni

the ﬁrst business transaction was the
election of W. L. Simmen, temporary
secretary.

Because of the various conﬂicts in - «

the shape of Charter Day, Cap and

it was decided not to have the election

for cheer leader and assistants before

March. However, the petitions for,
assistants, regularly signed by ten

hands of temporary secretary, W. L.

Simmen before March 1st..

A special ‘meeting will be held

Tuesday evening in the chancellor's A‘

a committee will report on a. new
constitution for the “Owl” board.

The trip to “Heinz plant was held

under advisement and a’ program  hi

system was also discussed, but no r 

deﬁnite action was taken.

Regular meetings are to be held
every Thursday evening in the
chancellor’s office at 7 :00.- ~ his
change was decided upon because of‘
the inconvenience attendant upon
those held in the Schenley Hotel. At
the meeting next Thursday, the or-

“BULL.” '

Prom,

. “Bull” is ...an expressive term more
current among the masculine mem-
bers of student society than among
If it did not
contain a core of trenchant truth, we
would not consider it worthy of our
editorial‘ dignity. There recently ap-
peared upon our university campus a
desultory and somewhat disguised
publication which circulated through
A ysterious channels but obtained a

ther, widespread audience- We in-

..l'1.d to make neither defense nor

criticism of the authors of “The
omb” nor any of its doctrines or
hdictments. The point we wish to
t -at is ‘one on which “The Bomb”
, seemed slightly overwrought, but at
"the same time one which comes home

to the business and bosoms ofevery
...-individual. That ‘‘Bull’’ is the under-
lying principle of the Administration

of this university we do not beli _e.

But that “bull” is in serious dange of

becoming the underlying principle of

the student body, we can not blink.
:. With that. phase of the university
life only are we called upon to deal,
and when the beam in the - under-
igraduate eye become so enlarged
as to obscure the note in the pro-
1: ieésorial or executive or graduate
optic, we believe that the student

’ blication has a function and a duty
-discharge which can come from no

ther organ.

} “Bull” we would deﬁne as: Any
'tten, spoken, or even unexpressed
ought, uttered in a spirit of in-

incerity, personal pride, or tainted

otive. That we are all guilty of
ul.l," -whether sinner or saint, is
ly too sadly apparent. That a
olemn obligation rests upon all of

_ to strive for its eradication goes

without saying. We frankly admit,

-moralistic tone. But every social

rder, howsoever sophisticated, must

have its priests and prophets. A
college, according to Mark Hopkins,
consists of a teacher, a student, and

«log to sit on. All of them are in-

fjfpensible ingredients, no one more

_  another. But the chain is no

htronger than its weakest link. The

"udent body of any institution of

_niing must learn tolerance, self-

uiigment, and sincerity of thought»

" speech, before it can become a
ortion of the world of men._

LETTER   BOX 

. Feb. 2, 1915.
To the Student Body of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh: -

Permit us to call your attention to
certain facts in connection with the
matter of student self-government in
this University.

There has been no meeting of the
Board of Control since Dec. ninth.
This means that there has been no
meeting during the present term,
which is more than four week old, and
that there has been no meeting since
the present member of the Board from
the ‘School’ of Medicine (Mr. Fouse)
was chosen. At the ﬁrst meeting of
the Board during the present school
yead it was voted that meetings
should be held at 12:30 each Wednes-
day throughout the year, and. at the
Hotel Schenley unless notiﬁed as to
change of place. The only attempt at
a meeting since Dec. ninth was on
Jan. 20, when Mr. Morgan, acting as
Chairman of the Board, issued notice
of a meeting, which was attended by
only two members, Messrs. Hoehl and
Meisel: Mr. Morgan was notpresent
nor were Messrs. Ashe, Fouse, Sim-
men and Flaccus. No other meeting
of any sort has been held.

Article VI, Sectionl, Part b, of the
Constitution of the Student Senate
provides that “The Board of Control
shall elect at its ﬁrst meeting a Chair-
man, Vice Chairman and Secretary-
Treasurer, who shall hold oﬂice for
one year.” Up to this time no Sec-
retary-Treasurer has ever been elect-
ed. No official record has been kept
during the-present year covering any
proceedings of the Board of Control.

The same section of the same article
provides that “The position of‘Chair-
man shall carry with it no preroga-
tives beyond those of an ordinary
member, except in the case when the
Chairman shall be authorized and in-
structed by the Board.” We believe
that this provision has been ignored
throughout the present year.

Article VI, again, provides that
“Each representative (in the Senate)
shall serve for one year, or until his
successor is elected, unless his term
shall be terminated by dismissal or
graduation from the University.” By
the provisions of this article there is
at present no member of the Board
of Control from the’ School of Eco-
nomics, as the term of Mr. Morgan,’
incumbent, expired at the time of the
annual elections in January, 1915,-
since which time there has been no
election to the position of President of
the ,Economics Senate—-hence that
school is unrepresented on the Board
of Control at this time. Hence there
is ,also no Chairman of the Board of
Control, Mr. Morgan having occupied
that position up to the time of the
expiration of his term of goﬁice as sen-
ator a month ago.

Three members" of the Board of
Control have signiﬁed their intention
to resign from that body unless there
is an immediate improvement in con-
ditions.

The rules for the election.of Cheer-
leader, which are a part of the Con-
stiution of the Student Senate, states
as follows: .

“Nominations for Head Cheerleader
be signed by ten qualiﬁed students and
given to the Secretary of the Board
of Control on or before the last
Tuesday of the Fall Term.

“Only Seniors or Juniors shall be
eligible for the position of Head
Cheerleader, and the candidates shall
have had at least one year of exper-
ience in .. college cheerleading or its
equivalent.

“The Head Cheerleader shall be,el-
ected at large during the second Week
of January.

“Three assistant cheerleaders shall
be elected at large at least two weeks
after the election of Head Cheerleader.

“The Head Cheerleader shall attend
all home contests and, in the event
of absence, one of his assistants shall
be instructed to take his place.”

The above sections of the rules of
the Senate have been disregarded both
by the Board of Control and by the
Head Cheerleader.

Copies of this letter have been sent
to the -president of each class in the
Undergraduate Schools, to the Presi-
dent of the Senate in the School of
Medicine and in the School of ., Den-
tistry, to the Editor of THE PITT
WEEKLY,_and aﬂixed to the various
bulletin boards in the University build-

A special meeting of .the General
Alumni Association was held in room
302 Thaw hall, Saturday evening, Jan-
uary 30, to act on therevised Consti-
tution and—By-Laws proposed by Al-
umni" Council. The recommendation
of Council were passed and will go
in effect at once. The principal al-
terations are as follows: _‘

A. A change in the election sys-
tem, by having a Nominating Com-
mittee, prepare a ballot for oﬂicers of
the General Alumni Association and
members‘ of Alumni Council. By-
Laws 3, which covers this now, reads,
as follows:

“Nominations for officers of the As-
sociation and for members of Alumni
Council should be made by a Nominat-
ing Committee, appointed by the
Chairman of Council and consisting
of one representative of each of the
following schools: College, Engineer-
ing, Law, Medical, Pharmacy, Dental,
Mines, Education and Economics.-
Said Committee shall prepare a list
of nominations containing at least
one name for each vacancy. The list
of nominations shall be published in
the official organ of the Association
at least sixty days before the annual
meeting, and each Week thereafter
until within ﬁfteen days of said meet-
ing. Other nominations may be made
by petition of ﬁve or more alumni,
same to be placed in the hands of the
Secretary at least ﬁfteen days before
the date of the annual meeting.
Names of additional candidate con-
tained in such petition or petitions to
be added to the list of nominations
and to be printed in the oﬂicial organ
of the Association, from week to week,
as they are received. Conditions gov-
erning method of adding names to bal-
lot by petition shall appear in said
oﬂicial organ, with each list of nomin-
ations published.” .

It .is believed that with the Nom-
inting Committee to select men who
are interested in alumni affairs and
with the restrictions which govern
their selections, the Alumni Council
can be made an efficient body. The
effort will be made to secure men who
have the time and inclination to at-
tend all the meetings and enter into
the work. Under the old system of
electing members to Council, men
were often chosen who really did not
have the time to devote.to the work
and who preferred not to serve.

B. Under the revised Constitution,
Alumni Council will be composed of
32 members at large and two mem-
bers from each of the nine schools re-
ferred to above. This makes a total

GENERAL ALUMNI ASSOCIATION MEETING

‘Constitution. calls for the election of

of 50 members, 25 to be elected each
year and members serving for two
years. At present, Council is com-
posed of 14 members at large and six
members from six schools. .No pro-
visionwas made in the"old code‘ for
representation from the Mines, Edu-
cation and Economics schools, they
having been- organized since that code
went into effect.

C. In order to take care of well
known alumni who should be honored
by the Alumni Association, the new

ten honorary Vice Presidents, they
having no speciﬁc duties. It is speci-
ﬁed that men shall only be chosen for
these offices who have graduated at
least ten years previous to date of
their nomination. '

D. In accordance with action of
,Council, the revised code calls for the
ﬁscal year of the Association to start
July 1,‘ instead of January 1.

An important addition calls for
the starting of an “Annual Subscrip-
tion Fund” to help carry on the work
of the Association, ~It is a voluntary
activity, the section relating to it be-
ing as follows:

“All additional money required for
the work of the Association shall be
obtained by calls upon the “Annual
Subscription Fund,” to which any
members "may subscribe such ‘maxi-
mum amount per year as he is will-
ing to pay, if needed. Calls upon such
fund shall be made only by a three-
fourths aﬂirmative vote of those pres-
ent at a meeting called by written not-
ice stating that such call will be pro-
posed. Every call shall be made pro
rata upon all subscriptions then in
force. All subscriptions shall contin-
ue in force throughout the ﬁscal year
and from year to year, and may be
cancelled or reduced only as of the
date of the annual meeting, and by
the written notice to the Secretary
before said date or within ﬁve days
thereafter, provided, however, that on
the death of any subscriber his sub-
scription shall terminate forthwith.”

The matter of electing women to
membership in the Association having
beenbrought up, the Association voted
that nothing in the Constitution or
By-Laws shall be construed to debar
Women from membership.”

The revised “Rules of the Alumni
Council” will be acted on at the March

been done, the complete Constitution
and By-Laws, and Rules of Council
will be published and each member of
the Alumni Association provided with

a copy.

Alumni are specially asked to note
the addition to the Association’s By-
Laws, calling for the inauguration of
an annual subscription fund to assist
in maintaining alumni activities at
the University. This is a VOLUN-
TARY affair entirely, there being no
change in the annual dues of $2.00.

At the present time, with the in-
creased activities which have been
started and are planned for the fut-
ure, itis essential that we be able to
ﬁgure on some income, in addition
to the annual dues. Each new activ-
ity adds to the running expenses of
the Association and if some provision
is not made for extra funds, the work
of the organization will be limited.

nus who is inclined can subscribe a
certain maximum amount that he or
she is willing to pay per year, if it
is_ needed. At the end of the year,
when the expenses have all been ﬁg-
ured out, calls will be made on the
subscribers‘ pro rata to take care of
these expenses which could not be paid
from the dues.

For instance,.if, after the money
from dues. was exhausted there was
$1000 in bills to be paid. Suppose we
have 20 subscribers of $100 maximum
each per year. We would have $2000
to take care of the‘ $1000 and each
subscriber would be asked to pay but
$50.00.

This plan is followed by many or-
ganizations similar to ours and has
always worked most satisfactorily.
We have many alumni who, we feel
sure, will be willing to enter into an
arrangement of this kind. Cards will
be printed to be signed by subscrib-

Who wish to enter into it may volun-

tarily do so. _ "

5  The Chartero-Day Banquetﬁat Hoteli‘ .

Schenley Feb. 26th, should bea big
“boost” for alumni affairs at the Uni-
versity. Many out, of town alumni
will be here on that day for the double
purpose of witnessing the dedication
of the new Mellon Institute and at-

tending the banquet". As has been an-

nounced, the banquet will start at 6:30
P. M. sharp and will be over in time
for those present to attend the recep-
tion in the Mellon Institute at 9 P. M.
or attend the Cap and Gown Club
show at the Schenley theater.

The Entertainment Committee is
perfecting its plans for the banquet.
Notices, with blank orders for.reser-
vations enclosed, will be mailed in the
near future to alumni. .

‘The list of speakers will soon be
completed. Several of the noted visi-
tors will be on this list.‘ As announced
in the last issue o_f THE WEEKLY,
Charles W. Scovel, '83, will be toast
master. -1 . l
7 An attractive souvenir menu card
program and songster is being de-
signed( for the affair.

The rate per plate is $2.00. The
Entertainment Committee announces
that ladies are welcome to attend this
banquet.

THE JUNIOR PROM.

   

 

Quite "a number of alumni have
ordered their tickets from the General
Secretary for the “Junior Prom”
Thursday night of next week. Others
who desire to be supplied phone or
send their orders by mail at once and
ticket will be mailed. The rate per
couple is $5.00. This will be the best
social event of the college year and
we want a good representation of
alumni. Indica.tions point to the
largest turn out of any “Prom.” It
is an affair where undergraduates and
alumni have a good chance to mingle
and get to know each other better.

To the list of alumni and students
who - attended the ,Westmoreland

the name of E. D. Seitz, of Trafford

of the Trafford City Tennis Associa-

have gone to Mr. Seitz, and he has

however, and it was found that the

ficiently to play there. A hurried call

to Mr.‘ Seitz brought back the re- .

    oMASTE|l IAN VARSITY

Pitt’s easiest job of the season came
last Friday night, when the Varsity
subdued West Virginia in a rather
listless game at Trees gym. The
Snakes were never dangerous,_ and as
a result Flint’s pupils w’ereAinAclined to
be careless. The ﬁnal score, 042 to
18, was made" possibly by individual
play, rather than by any ﬁnished team-
work. . ' ‘
The Blue and Gold started oﬂ with
a good lead, which increased through.-
out the game. West‘ Virginia played
a remarkably‘ cleangame, only four
fouls being marked up against them,
while the Varsity ’was convicted of
only twelve infractions of the rules.
As a consequence, fouls played-little
-part in thesscoring‘. . ' ,,
‘For Pitt, Matson ledin the scoring,
with ﬁve ﬁeld goals to his credit. One
of Joe's shots, from near the center-
ofthe floor, was a scream. Matson
was also successful in out jumping
Ice, though Keatley held Pitt’s’ center
more nearly even. A L ‘
Lubic and Graham excelled in ﬂoor
work, while Healy also did Well, in
the few minutes he was in the lineup.
Lubic caged three shots, while holding
his opposing forward scoreless. Every
member of the Varsity squad got into
the game, and every man scored at
least once.  A ~
West Virginia was weak in shoot-
ing, and missed several easy chances
to score. Their best bet was Race,
who also had the distinction of being
the smallest man of their ﬁve. His
long shot from down the ﬂoor was
the visitors’ best attempt of .the even-
ing.  ‘

BECOMING PLENTAIFUL.

sonality of Charles Reinecke, the new-
ly signed wrestling coach, are working
wonders‘ in the men who have thus
far reported for work. A tremendous
amount of interest has been aroused

‘and new men are being added each

day to the already large squad. There

good men, and it is expected- that the
complement of aspirants will increase,
with every work out. Among the new

‘men reporting for practice are Wilson,

a 219 pound man from the School of
Economics and “Ted” Fry from the
College, who is to enter the 158«pound
class. ‘

Barrett and Blaustein, who have
been out o fthe game for a‘ week past,
arenow nearly ready to resume‘ work
on the mat. " Reilley, who. has been.
laid up for the past few weeks, is
now back onthe job and ‘will make a
strenuous attempt _to overcome any
lead that the others in his class may
have gained during his retirement
from practice. »

-The ﬁrst real test of the Blue and
Gold grapplers will ,come with the
Middle Atlantic Championship Meet
at the P. A. A. on February 19 and
20A,, in - which Coach 1 Reinecke an-
nounces he will enteg a. complete team.
The combat with Lehigh ‘has: been
called off and Lafayette maybe en-
tered in their stead. It isalso» hoped
that W. & J. will be added tothe
schedule before the close of the seas-
on.

    FRENZIED FANAATIGS»

With ‘the Penn game still nine
months off, plans are already under
way to insure a big delegation from
Pittsburgh. Never have Pitt men been
so interested in a_n out-of-town game,
and while it is too early to do any-
thing but make a wild guess, it ap-
pears that the Varsity will be ac-
companied to the city of Morpheus-
by a large crowd of rooters. B

the Dental School, and which has for
its purpose the securing of fans to
make the Philadelphia trip, is model-
ed after the Christmas Savings Funds
operated by local banks. By this plan,
one dollar is deposited each week from
Feb. 1st to June 15th, making a total
of twenty dollars. This amount is left
at interest, and is withdrawn. in
October, when it will meet all the ex-
penses of the trip, including -rilroad
and Pullman fare, admission to the
game, and some incidentals. '
Heretofore, one of the principal dif-
ﬁculties in .the_wayof- promoters of a

average student, raising twenty or
twent-ﬁve dollars all at once is next
to impossible. If this scheme is fol-
lowed"-, the process _is more gradual,
and the -suffering“ much less intense.‘
A ‘special train can‘be secui-edlfor one
hundred or more persons, and it is
quite likely that the number will go
well above the century mark. Such a
delegation would make it possible to
secure a special section at Franklin
ﬁeld, as well. - .
Active work‘ will
if the. results are at all encouraging,

. the plan will be extended generallq,

so that students wil have an oppor-
tunity to get in‘ on the. good ‘thing.

inthese columns from time to time. K

more than 100 schools are engaged in

“The work has proved of advantage
to the workman, the student, the em-
ployer and the community- It is not
to be confused with regular sett1-e-
ment work, as one of the main ob-
jectivesis the development’ of. the
studentwho is A doing the teaching.
Reﬁned tools of production make pos-
sible high social development, but
they by no means insure it unless they
are directed in a spirit of fairness,
goodwill and social responsibility.
The development -Of this spirit is the
object of the movernent.”

' It will be noticed that the cooper-
ative plan followed by many ‘engineer-
ing schools, is a direct recognition and
extension of the principles mentioned
in the above paper. , But industrial
Service work does not and should not
stop here. Its call is not for the en-
gineeringstudents alone; ‘it is for the
‘college student as well and for the
medical men, for the student of edu-
cation, ‘ economics, - pharmacy, ‘ yes,
even law; in short, every one. Let
us see then brieﬂy what are the chief
features of the movement and how
they can be applied’ at the University
Of*Pittsburgh.‘ V  u

1. The movement was started by a
few engineering students in .the Shef-
ﬁ‘ie1d_ Scientiﬁc School of Yale Uni-
versity in the winter of 1907 and 1908.
Living, and working conditions among
the great mass of Working men in the
-city of New Haven were studied and
it was found that for the foreigners
the knowledge of the English langu-
age was the most necessary and press-

cool affairs the atmosphere is quite
warm. In fact scorched. " This is be-
cause of the epithetical hot air'that

ing e1ement.~ Immediately, a system.
of. instruction in Englishwas evolved,
based miainly on the phases of every

A day life, which did notrequire a knoW- ' ‘

ledge of the foreign languages on the
part of the teacher. Classes of four
or ﬁve were organized in the Various
parts of the city and the students
went to m‘eet their classes .on certain.
nights rather than have the men come
to the school, thus inspiring in ‘the
men full conﬁdence as ‘to the altruistic
purpose and goodwill of the students.
Later groups became so large that it
was necessary to have some more ad-
vanced classes to come up to the Y.
M. . C.. A. building of the Sheffield
Scientiﬁc School. Soon the inspira-
tion of the work spreadamong the
students of the whole -Universityand

‘beyond expectation. In fact students
of all classes, athletes, engineers, lit-
erary aspirers, social lights, all seem-
ed to take pride in joining the work
and found in it the deep joy and sat-
isfaction which comes from service
rendered. -  A

” 2. The movement has since been
proceeding with unparalleled success.
It has ‘been’ everywhere afliliated with
the‘. Y. M. C. »A. institutions and thus
has been able to reach a~-much greater

dAo'ne,oAthAe'rwise. And _.now, according
to the latest statistics 600,000 men are
‘being reached every week by 3500
students from 160 colleges, working
under the auspices of the city and col-
.lege Y. M. C. A.’s. ‘

‘ 3. The’ activities included in the
Industrial Service Movement are in a
general way as follows-: '

- ‘a. ‘ Investigation of c o n d i ti O n s
‘existing in shops,’ mines and other
places of industrial‘ work, and ,A the
study of means of approach and social
uplift without interfering in any way
with the (activity of other social or-
ganizations. This has been accomplish-
ed most satisfactorily - by arranging

the faculty; These lectures are given
by competent managers, engineers and
by men who have made a special study
of the subject.  .

'b.~ Actual personal contact with the
workmen in some line of service. This
is by far the most important and
tangible side of the movement. It
has thus far taken the form of giving
instruction too» the . workmen, through
the voluntary work of the «students,
mainly in’ the study of English,
Elementary 0‘ , Mathematics, Drawing,
Citizenship, etc. AWith the immigrants
and at large portion of the‘ foreign
born workmen, English is the crying
