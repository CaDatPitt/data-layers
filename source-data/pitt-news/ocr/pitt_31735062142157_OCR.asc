‘By IRWIN ROSEN

Over sixty percent of the
general student body has re-
turned for the summer semes-
ter.

And the summer semester en-
rollment is sixty-five percent of
what it was last year.

These are the latest registration

ﬁgures, released by Vice-Chancel- _

lor Rufus H. Fitzgerald. “Sixty per-
cent is a higher ﬁgure than any of
us hoped for,” declared Mr. Fitz-
gerald, “and it shows that acceler-
ation can work and is working.”
Vice-Chancellor Fitzgerald also
"explained the administration’s
policy on extra-curricular activi-
ties during the summer. Accord-
ing to him, “the University in-
tends to comply with the govern-
ment request that all schools and
colleges throughout the country
curtail all extra-curricular activi-
ties not directly connected with
the war effort.
“From now on in, for the fall and
winter and spring terms, as well as

f. during the summer, the University

must, along with all other Ameri-
can colleges, consider itself a place
of intense effort and accomplish-
ment. To this end, there can no
longer to be encouraged the normal,
peace-time activities that students
may have heretofore enjoyed.”

In further carrying out this pro-
gram of activities curtailment for
the summer, the new University
budget, it was learned, makes no
appropriation to any activity oth-
er than the Pitt News. And since
all University activities rely, at
least in part, upon the University
for their ﬁnancial existence this
newest budget allotment will deﬁ-
nitely force regular fall and winter
extra-curricular activities out of
the picture as far as summer oper-
ation is concerned.

The budget calls for payment of
faculty salaries during the sum-
mer semester on a. pooled basis.
That is, salaries from each school
of the University will be put into a
pool and paid commensurately with
the hours taught by each faculty
member. Thus, the salary paid eacn
faculty member will depend first
upon the number of hours he teach-
es this summer, and second upon
what he ordinarily receives during
the fall and winter terms.

“Thus,” explained Mr. Fitzgerald,
“any money taken and diverted into
activities, would have to come from
other, far more vital University
needs.

That little man , who walks
around the campus hooting at peo-
ple has a lot on his mind. A pile
of Owls to be exact. His name is
Trovaioli, August.

“Hoot mon, have you claimed
your 1942 Owl yet?” If not Tro-
vaioli would like for you to do so
before August. He can understand
why C. A. Helferman does not
claim his yearbook, for he is in
the Army air corps.

And the two girls who live in
Erie, Pa., and Detroit, Michigan.
naturally are not here to get their
yearbooks. There are a few stu-
dents, however, who are living near
here who can get their books at
any time.

More could be said, but it. too,
would be uncalled for.

Speaker Discusses
Malay Significance

At a luncheon for commercial
education students at the Fairfax
hotel last Wednesday, Miss Virginia
Lake, guest speaker, discussed the
signiﬁcance of Malay in relation

l  to the fall of Singapore.

Miss Lake, with ﬁve years] of ex-

 perience in Malay, gave a compre-
. L hensive speech dealing with tthe
 customs of the country, the native

habits, the educational program
which had been in effect, and the
situation of Malay today in the war.

Students’ War Attitude
Helpful, Stimulating--Oliver

By BILL LEVIN

Helpful and stimulating. That’s how Dr. John Oliver,
head of the department of history, and in charge of Pitt’s
morale institute, ﬁnds the attitude of students toward the war.

“They"re serious, really determined to accomplish what

they can while they have a chance.
They realize that they are attend-
ing school on borrowed time.” Dr.
Oliver shook his head. “Oh. I know
students are puzzled and undecid-
ed, but who isn’t? And at least stu-
dents are honest with themselves.

“And that’s what we want this
morale institute to be—honest——
an honest exprcmion and defense
of this war-” Dr. Oliver feels deﬁ-
nitely that the people want no part
of, and have no need for cushioned
accounts of the truth, that they
realize the fight on their hands
realize there. can only be one out-
come if they hope for a decent
post-war world. ‘

“Either we win, or they win.
And this threat to the principles of
our democratic world is certainly
enough cause for fighting."

“Morale, on the whole, in the
United States? It's good, there can
be-no doubt about that. Before the
war, there was, naturally enough.
grumbling on the part of some sol-
diers and workers who were train-
ing for theyuknew-not-what. But
since the war-—."

“President Roosevclt does a fine
job of morale building through his
ﬁreside chats. People like to hear
information straight from the
boss, and Roosevelt has a sincere
way of talking.”

According to Dr. Oliver, the
morale institute has been planned
primarily for teachers and group
leaders, to show those who want to
know how to combat false informa-
tion and faulty attitudes. A few
people still lack basic understand-
ing as to what our country faces;
and through this training course‘,
sponsored by the United States Olf-
fice of Education and the Univer-
sity, these teachers and leaders will
be better equipped to do their job.

“But we want as many student.-'
who can to attend these meetings.
The more who have an understand-
ing of the true facts, the better off
our country will be.”

The institute began Wednesday,
when the program was divided into
two sessions, the morning‘ one, con-
cerned with leadership training in
civilian morale, and the afternoon
session, which investigated educa-
tional, political and journalistic
problems of morale.

As a follow-up of these panel
discussions and talks last Wednes-
day, lectures and demonstrations
will be presented at the Foster Me-
morial in the next several weeks.

Registration For
Reserve Corps
To Continue

l

Registration of students in
the Enlisted reserve. corps will
probably continue through the
next two weeks so that most
of the eligible students. can be cata-
logued.

Although a time limit for this
semester has not been established,
it is expedient for an applicant to
get his registration card in as soon
as possible so that he may be con-
sidered thoroughly.

The system used for selection is’

as follows: For the first week a cer-
tain percentage of the applicants
are selected for enlistment by
means of scholastic averages. This
percentage is in proportion to the
amount of the quota for each class
the military department wishes to
ﬁll that week.

These names are then posted on
the bulletin board on the ground
floor where all applicants may see
the names. of the se-lectees.

However. the quota. designated
for the summer will probably not
be filled during the first week.
Some selcctc-cs will be unable to
pass the physical examination,
which will leave more room for
applicants who have been left of
of the list and for other applicants
who . might have sent in reg-
istration caris. in the meanwhile.

According to  plan, the en-
listing will continue until the quota
is ﬁlled. Registration cards may be
obtaizned in the oliﬁace of the deans
of the respective schools and in the
military oﬁee, 435 Cathedral.

The quota for each class in the
University, not affected by enlist-
ment of Advance: course ROTC stu-
dents in the Enlisted corps reserve,
is: for freshmen, 279 istudents;
sophomores, 267 students; juniors,
183 s.tu=d:ents.; seniors, 1278 students;
and for special students. 1%’ selec-

Studcnts, who are not selected
during the SIDDCI’ for enlistment
but who have applied, will be
eligible during the fall recruiting.

Students. will enlist in the Enlist-
ed reserve‘ unassigned except as
follows: students accepted for the
air corps will he enlisted in the
air corps reserve; students taking
electrical engineering will be en-
listed in the Signal corps reserve,
and students taking coast artil-
le'Iy.—ROVfC will he enlisted in the
coast artillery reserve.

starting at 7 o’clock"”and continu-
ing until 9 o’clock.

Robert Arthur, director of’ the
University band, has consented to
have his concert orchestra play for
the gathering.

There will be no set program
scheduled. Instead there will be
approximately 200 upperclass stu-
dents, both men and women, serv-
ing as aides, who will act the part
of hosts and rostess-es.

Chancellor John G. Bowman,
Vice»Chanccllor Rufus Fitzgerald,
and Frank Shockley, director of
the stunner sessions, will be pres-
ent to receive the students.

At the conclusion of the evenin g,
refreshments will be served on the

Hoping to stray ‘from the usual
stiff, formal gatherings of the past,
Deans. Rush and Biddle expressed
the hope that every student would

F- ,-

 

 , SPORTS EDITOR

:,Guest‘ ‘Columnist: Bud Henclel, Michigan Daily

J _When colleague Zelenski asked this typewriter athlete
to take over the column on today’s sports page, we heartily
accepted his invitation. But when we hauled out the faithful
portable we found that writing a guest column is a far cry
from the regular daily stint. In short, we didn’t know what
to write about which would be of interest to the readers of
the Pitt News.

_ ‘The’astute Mr. Zelenski does far too good a job of bring-

ing you news of Pitt in the sphere of collegiate athletics to

allow any intruder to broach upon his realm. So we decided
not to write about the Cathedral Panther. Then we thought
pf a column on Fielding H. Yost, but the fact that every
fai_thful sports scanner knows the story of old “Hurry Up”

_ruled out that one. Next came the idea of explaining the

physical hardening program which has been established at

(practically every Midwestern university for all undergradu-

ate male students in order to make them better prepared

to carry the war to a successful conclusion. But that makes

for dry reading at best.

_ So we decided to‘ relate the story of little Peter Solar. It’s

not a story which will ever rate bold, black headlines on any
sports page, but it does show the value of sports in overcom-
ing hitherto hopeless physical inﬁrmities. It’s a tale of a great
swimming team, a great swimming coach and mostly of a
great little kid who didn’t know what it meant to quit. -

‘ Pete Solar had spent half of his six years in a hospital
bed, the victim of infantile paralysis. His parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Reeves R. Solar of Ann Arbor, Mich., had discovered the af-
ﬂiction when he was three years old and for the next three
years little Pete had fretted under the care of specialists who
were unable to make him walk or raise his left arm above the
Waist. Science couldn’t help him. _ -

Frantic with worry, his parents didn’t know where to
turn. Then Mrs. Solar remembered an article she had read
somewhere on how swimming could aid in regaining the use
of paralyzed muscles. Doctors, when queried, told her it could
do her son no harm-—they themselves could do him no good.
So, Mrs. Solar enlisted the services of Matt Mann, coach of
Michigan’s then national champions and dean of the nation’s
natatorial mentors, and his entire crew.‘

At ﬁrst it wasn’t easy for Pete, but somehow he must
have known that he was fighting for a healthy, normal life
because he never whimpered and he never stopped trying. Be-
sides it was fun, more fun than he had ever had before in his":
life. . ’

Almost before he knew it, he was able to swim—to/move
the muscles that were for so long unmovable. Matt and his
mermen had been patient with him, but they never had to
coax him. When varsity practice would start, little Pete was
in-variably the first one in thenpool, clamoring for instruction.
Today he is able to walk and run, and even ride a bike. He can
swim any stroke, and is able to dive from the high board.

The Wolverine swimmers all helped him. Dobby Burton
and Gus Sharemet taught him the freestyle, Dick Riedl the
backstroke, Jim Skinner the breast-stroke and Strother Mar-
tin diving. His particular idol is Skinner, national breast-
stroke titleholder, and someday nine-year old Pete hopes t
equal Skinner’s feats. And someday he might. *

. Mrs. Solar says it was a miracle that restored her‘ child to
health. But Matt Mann comes closer to the truth. He claims
it was Pete himself who did it. According to Matt, if Pete had
ever quit trying he would be still a hopeless cripple. His sheer
desire to learn to swim, coupled with the b'eneﬁts derived
from the sport itself, brought living to his life in the place of
=exist.ence. We’ve met little Pete and we agree with Matt Mann.
 He’s‘a great little kid, Pete Solar, a great~little kid who
‘overcame an insurmountable physical handicap simply be-
iizause he was never handicapped for lack of determination.

Physical Education, Athletic Programs
Not To Suffer By Wartime Priorities

, School physical education and
athletic programs will not suffer
for want of equipment and trans-
portation due to the war, Dr. E. C.
Davis, head of the physical educa-

tion department at the University, '

3111101111085.

Dr. Davis, vice-president of the ‘

American Association for Health,
Physical Education, and Recrea-
tion last year and a member of the
board of directors of the associa
tion this year, says that his group
has the word of Donald Nelson
that such supplies and facilities
will be available.

In reply to a letter from the as- A

sociation, N. G. Burleigh, chief of
the services branch, War Production
board, said, “Individual gymnas-

iums, playgrounds, and swimming 3

Unit Leaves

For Unknown Destination

Mobilization of General. Hospital
27 at Pitt will be completed next
Wednesday, July 15, when the unit
will leave for an unknown destina-
tion.

General Hospital 27 is a reorgan-
ization of Base Hospital 27 organ-
ized by the University to serve in
Angers, France, duringthe World
War. The personnel is greater than
that of the 1_91’7-191s Pitt unit. It
has 48 medical doctors, seven den-
tists, two chaplains, 120 nurses, and
ﬁve commissioned and five non-com-
missioned non-medical men. The
Pitt unit will be equipped to handle
1,000 beds. 5

Reorganization was. ordered by
the Surgeon Genera_l’s oﬂice more

than a year ago. Lieutenant-Cob
nel Harry, E. Feather, . assistant
professor of surgery, will be in
charge of the unit; and Lieutenant-
Colonel George E. Martin, assist-
ant professor of medicine, will be
in charge of the medical service
division.

The personnel will be trained for‘

a period of time before going to
battle base. Equipment will be ship-
ped with the unit when it sails.
Most of the personnel are alumni of
Pitt or have been associated with
the School of Medicine or the Uni-
versity’s Medical Center.

Base Hospital 27 in the World
War was organized on the campus
in 1917, sailed on the Red Star liner
Lapland early in September of 1917,
arrived in Angers, France, and by
November was ready for the ﬁrst
patients, 20 American soldiers.

By January, 1919, after 15 months
in France, the unit had cared for
a total of 19,582 men as well as
many outpatients
ca_mps. The hospital at Angers,

take care of 5,000 patients.

chartered buses for the transporta-
tion of athletic teams will havejp;

Dr. Davis says that school 
letic coaches, directors of physical
education, and other school adminis-
trators have been informed of this
interpretation of the War Produc-
tion board so that physical educa-
tion, recreation. and athletic pro-
grams will not suffer.

Retail Research bureau at the
University is oifering for the first
time a concentrated session for de-
».;partment store employees this sum-
mer. The "courses started last Mon-
day and will continue until July 31.
.. Since the Retail bureau originat-
. ed in 1918 from conditions‘ much
the same as they are today, the
bureau recognized the need to
train store employees quickly for
responsible positions. Bishop

«Brown, director of the department,
stated. a

Training in leadership techniques,
personnel management problems,
legislation, job coordination, mer-
chandising, advertising and sales
promotion, fashion merchandise in-

. formation, customer relations, and

 research techniques is being given,

Mr. Brown said. No credit will be
allowed for the courses.

Regular members of the stall’ are
teaching the courses. Included
among these are: Mr. Brown; Lil-
lian Friedman, assistant professor
ofrpersonnel management; Fred A.
Egmore, assistant professor of mer-
jchandising and research; Ruth
Branigan, assistant professor of
advertising; Nancy L. Larson, in-
structor in salesmanship; Albert:

-‘B. Smith, instructor in {operating

methods and research; and Walter
Sobotka, instructor in textiles and
applied arts.

L The classrooms, library, and lab-
oratory of the bureau, located on
the nineteenth ﬂoor of the Cathe-
dral, are being used for the session.

Normally co-eds on the Michigan
campulsare outnumbered two to one
by the men. During the summer
term the masculine element is going
to be more dominant, according to
a survey recently completed by the
University's War board.

Fifty-one percent of the male
students who replied to a question-
naire indicated they planned to en-

roll in the summer term, 35 per ‘

cent were uncertain and 14 per
cent indicated they expect to re-
enroll in the University at some
time during the 1942-43 year but

disastrous defeats in Northern
Africa, Dr. Graper said that the
opposition of the two extremes, the
independents of the conservative
party and the left-wing laborites
against Prime Minister Winston
Churhill, came to a head and re-
sulted in the debate over the im-
portant issue of conﬁdence.

However, the overwhelming vote
of conﬁdence whiclrthe House of
Commons gave the ministry, the

count being 475 to 25, proved de-
cisively how strong the position
of Churchill was even after the
reveraes he had endured, he said.
One of “the main criticisms of
the Churchill government is that
he has not democratized the army
enough. One laborite, Dr. Graper
said, told Churchill on the Commons
floor that under the British system
Rommel, who is ﬁeld marshall of
the German forces in Africa, would
be no more than a sergeant.

A strong point in Chourchilfs
favor, however, Dr. Graper said,
is that a suitable man can not be
found to take his place. Anthony
Eden is not wanted the way af-
fairs stand and Sir Stalford Cripps,
the logical choice, is a member of
no party in England.

Also in his discussion of England,
Dr. Graper stated facts on the con-
ditions of food rationing, transpor-
tation, hours of work, and blackouts,
the people of England are enduring.

Speaking on American politics,
he declared that there is a need of
fundamental reform in the direc-
tion of centralization. Under the
present set-up, national oﬂicers
must bargain with local political
bosses.

In’ explanation he cited the case
of the appointment to a federal
judgeship of Thomas Meaney of
New Jersey. Although many na-

I tional and local olﬁcers objected to

Meaney’s appointment, he was se-
lected and conﬁrmed by the Senate
because Mayor Frank I-Iague’s in-
ﬂuence was enough to merit both
President Roosevellfs support and
the aid of Senator Smathers, dem-

- ocratic senator from New Jersey.

_ In answer to a question from the
audience as to how this problem
could be solved, Dr. Graper said
that on an issue of political con-
troversy a national election should
be held to determine whether the
critics or the President should! be
sustained. -
