Unitedjewis/9 Federation aids Sovzetjews CORRECHON

By Matt Goldstein

Fleeing to the United States or

Is_rael is the only source of hope '

for many Soviet Jews to escape
the anti-Semitism which threatens
their lives.

“Anti-Semitic stories or physical
threats give a person refugee
status and allows them to come
[to the United States] right away
without waiting for a green card,"
said Janet Engelhart of the
Pittsburgh Chapter of the United
Jewish Federation.

They can also get a job right
away and have access to medical
attention and food stamps,
according to Engelhart.

Forty thousand SovietJews are
allowed into the United States
each year.

“Right now the only way for a
Soviet Jew to come to the U.S. is
by invitation from a close relative,”
Engelhart said.

Half of all Soviet Jewish
immigrants who come to America
settle in New York. Many also
immigrate to Boston, Chicago,
San Francisco, Los Angeles and

popul-ations,
Engelhart said.

According to her estimates,
Pittsburgh falls about two—thirds
down the list.

The Hebrew Immigration Aid
Society in New York coordinates
all 40,000 resettlements in the
country and then notifies the UJF
in Pittsburgh how many families
will be coming.

Currently this country is seeing
its largest “wave” of SovietJewish
immigration since the 1970s, with
more people discovering
Pittsburgh each year. Since 1988,
419 Soviet Jews coming to
Pittsburgh.

the United States are reuniting for
the first time with other family
members already living here.The
last wave of immigration
separated many families,
Engelhart said.

Though one or two families
may settle in small cities, such as

, Erie or Altoona, most Soviet

families are lured to the major
cities, where job prospects are
better. Pittsburgh provides a big-
city atmosphere yet isn’t
overwhelming for them,
according to Engelhart.

The UJF is just one of several
organizations which aids in the
resettlement process. The Jewish

Weisberg, who also leads a
shopping tour around the city
once a month.

English classes are taught at the
JCC, and job-placement services
are provided where new Jewish

Americans polish their résumés I

and practice interviewing skills.
“We want the families to become
as self-Sufficient as possible,”
Engelhart said.

Weisberg said she agrees and
she stresses street smarts. “I want
them to be able to go to the
doctor, take a bus, ask for
directions,” she said.

Crime Stop is a network of communications between on-
campus resident directors and the Department of Public Safety.
The resident directors relay the information they receive from
the safety department to the resident assistants, who then give
the reports to the students. Students can also report crime
information to the campus police using the same procedure.

According to Eric Shiner, president of the Resident Student
Association, “The program has potential.” However Shiner said
he doesn’t believe the crime reports are getting to all of the

Rozin came to the U.S. 12 years
ago from the Ukraine.

Weisberg said that Rozin serves
as a leader and role model for all
Jewish immigrants in Pittsburgh.
.“Nobody comes to Pittsburgh
without working with her,”
Weisberg said.

Rozin is now working on the
Jewish New American Hanukkah
Festival, which is to take place on
Nov. 24 at the JCC, featuring
world-renowned violinist Galina
Heifetz. ‘fShe’s the creme de la

' Weisberg and Rozin expressed
their thanks to the Buncher Family ,

All three women emphasize
that the organizations do not
compete against one another, but
rather work together toward the

“Gorbachev has recently

The Department of Public

According to Waters, the

Carnegie passes free to CAS students

By Dan Darragh
For T be Pitt News

Connoisseurs of the fine arts
and students who just enjoy art
museums may want to pick up a
free pass to the Carnegie Museum
offered by the Student
Government Board.

The SGB, in conjunction with
the Office of Student Affairs,
purchased 3,700 student term
passes to the Carnegie .Art
Museum in Oakland. These are
available on a first-come, first-
serve basis to all non—CGS
undergraduate students.

They are free and can be
picked up in the Student
Government Board office in 639
William Pitt Union.

Students with passes receive
free admission to the museum
and are also entitled to a 10-
percent discount on items in the
museum’s giftshop. ‘

would cost “students three
dollars. '
The pass is good until June

1992.

In the future there is a possibility
the museum café will be open to
the students on Friday evenings.
Different features will be offered
each weekend, such as an ice
cream bar or a buffet.

SGB recently selected a student
committee to look into this
development. It will be meeting
this weekend with Doris Carson
Williams, director of the Office of
Business Enterprises.

Passes were given to art and
theater majors at Pitt, many of
whom practice drawing at the
museum. Passes were also given
to all Freshmen Studies 001
professors to hand out in their
classes.

“There are lots left  We hope
the passes will appeal to the
under-21 crowd. This will give

Free AIDS testing available locally

By Carolyn Oliver
For The Pitt News

AIDS struck 650 people in Allegheny county in
1990. It is estimated that for every reported case
of AIDS, there are 10 to 15 other cases that have
not been diagnosed, according to county health-
department figures.

If someone suspects they have been exposed
to the AIDS virus, there are several places that
person can go for free testing. V

Patients who want to ensure complete
anonymity should pay attention to test lingo.

A confidential test requires that patients state
their names and sign a consent form for the test.

“While we do have to have the person sign a
consent form, we do consider the results
conﬁdential," said Mary Weber of the health
department. “People could give us wrong
information, and as long as they remembered it,
we wouldn't know,” she added.

Also, there is anonymous testing where the
patient is only identified by a number, and the

clinic does not ask for a name.

Pennsylvania law requires a person taking an
AIDS test to have counseling before and after the
test to make sure the patient understands the test
and the results.

According to Risa Sherman of the Pittsburgh A

AIDS Task Force, the counselors “not only
discuss what the results mean technically but
how they will affect [the personl.”

The Allegheny County Health Department
provides free, confidential testing. It offers walk-
in and appointment testing in Oakland. It takes
seven to 10 working days to receive test results.

Family Planning Services of Pittsburgh offers
conﬁdential, free AIDS testing. Results come
back within two to three weeks.

The Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force has free,
confidential testing and counselors available on
nights and weekends. Its results take seven to 10
working days to come back.

Student Health Services offers free testing for
students,but they usually refer people to the
county health department.

Resident director Mary Ellen
Hiotakis said there was a lack of
participation last year, and as a
result a lot of information about
the program hasn’t gotten out yet.
“We’re doing a lot of planning
now, and we're encouraging
students of residence halls to get
involved,” Hiotakis said.
She also said the Resident
Student Association and campus
police are organizing workshops
and training programs this year
A and are asking for volunteers from
all the residence halls to attend.
According to campus police
Sgt. Charlie Grier, theeducation
and training module will explain
the goals of Crime Stop and train
the student participants.
Workshops will address what
action students should take if
they observe a crime in their area.
Pitt senior Brian Meyer, an off-
campus resident of Oakland, said

he’s never heard of Crime Stop
but thinks it should be just as
much a part of off-campus life.
“Ever since they started
withholding campus—police
reports, we don’t know what’s
going on anymore,” he said.
Gould said he tried to expand
the program to South Oakland,
but there is a gap between the
permanent residents.
permanent residents don’t want
to work with us,” Gould said.
William Brennan, director of
Public Safety, who worked with
Gould on the program, said they
will continue to try and expand
the program to South Oakland.
“We haven’t given up,” Grier
said about expanding the program
to off-campus residents. “We are
encouraging off-campus student
residents to join similar crime-
watch programs in their
neighborhoods and keep the
communication lines open."

Bullwinkle, Gumby,

Groucho Marx, Imelda
Marcos and Richard Nixon
were a few of the write—in
candidates for the Student
Government Board election
last night.

Many students’ names
were‘ also written in,
according to Theresa
Wilson, the elections-
committee chairperson.

“There were more write-
ins this _year than in the
past. The amount for board
and president were about
equal,” Wilson said. I

“I wish a lot more students
would take the time to run
a write—in campaign.
Students do actually take
the time to write candidates’
names \in, ” she said.

A student’S ballot
becomes invalid when a
candidate that does not -
meet the eligibility
requirements is written in,
according to Wilson.

A student wishing to be a
write—in candidate must

. submit an official transcript
24 hours prior to elections,
she said.

The only candidate
eligible to be written in was

_ Michael Zercher, who
received no votes.

votes is just too small,” she said.
“Students did vote in places
where the turnout is usually small.
Voting in Towers decreased, but

 

smaller locations pulled in more ,

votes than in previous years,”
Wilson said.

A factor that may increase
Student voting would bea bigger

‘selection of candidates. “We

always encourage students to
run for the SGB. In the early ’80s,
we had as many as six presidential
candidates and 12 to 13
candidates for board,” Wilson

The decision to implement a
North Oakland shuttle will be
made based On the outcome of
yesterday's election referendum.

The question On yesterday's
ballot asked students whether
there was a need for a North
Oakland shuttle.

The referendum passed with
1,362 votes for and 122 votes
against.

Representatives from the
Student Government Board and
the Department Of Public

 

Safety will also be meeting soon
to determine whether there is a
need for a North Oakland
shuttle.

The shuttle will cost roughly
$25,000 for the first year of
operation.

According to Brent Saunders,
president of SGB, a survey taken
lastjanuary to determine the need
for a North Oakland shuttle did
not get an overwhelming
response.

The SGB decided to postpone
implementing the shuttle until
students demonstrated a sufficient
need. \

Because Of the amount of
money the shuttle will cost, the

. SGB is focusing On coordinating

the schedules of the various
shuttle services already existing
in Oakland.

“We don’t want to spend the
money if the students aren’t going
to use it. If we can coordinate a
really efficient transportation
system with the other shuttle
services, we wouldn’t have to
buy another shuttle,” Saunders
said. ' -

Another factor that will
influence the outcome of the
North Oakland shuttle depends

on how much money tlhegj
Department of Public Safety
will commit to the proposed, .1

project.

Department of Public Safety

' Director Bill Brennan Said, “The

project is still very premature.

We need to see if enough '

money.”

Currently there is a shuttle that‘ I —

further need is proven.

Sex assault at Pitt

Pitt, which claimed in an annual report to have had no
cases of rape reported on the main campus for the 1990-

= 1991 school year, makes the campus sound as if no sex
" crimes ever occur here.

Sadly, this assumption was proven wrong Tuesday.
_ Though not considered a rape, a female Pitt student was

‘sexually assaulted at gunpoint earlier this week.

The victim had just finished studying in Forbes
Quadrangle when an assailant approached and forced

 0 her to Mazeroski Field, ‘across the street from the
 Quadrangle.

After telling her that she would be shot if she moved, he
assaulted her and then ﬂed towards the Frick Fine Arts
building. '

 i . . The Department of Public Safety has a detailed description
, of the assailant but has no “solid leads,”

according to
Public Safety Director Walt Waters. “
Flyers describing the crime and assailant have been
distributed to all campus buildings. Hopefully, this action
might prevent a repeat of the crime.
The ﬂyer program is relatively new, but awareness is
always vital to the prevention of such violations in the

future.

Also alarming is the fact that this crime occurred just as
the student had completed her studies for the evening.

Sexual-assault cases should not be taken lightly.

In an area with an abundance of college students who
study by themselves late at night, more security is
necessary around campus buildings.

Finding a secluded area in which to study at the
University of Pittsburgh is not an easy task. However- quiet
areas which are open late at night
should not be without police protection.

Campus -police officer Mike Pampena told The Pitt News
that on a “normal” night Forbes Quadrangle is patrolled

_' by one beat officer, one police car andone guard in the

building. The fact that the campus police are housed in
the same location where the sexual assault occurred
should instill discomfort in students. '

A “normal” night consists of one that has no officer
calling off for illness or other personal reasons.

Even more atrocious, though, there is only one beat

officer assigned to patrol the Litchfield Towers, Bruce

Hall, Brackenridge Hall, Amos Hall, McCormick Hall and
Holland Hall.

More than 3,000 students are housed in these dormitories.
Although Crime Stop is a major safety-communication
network and any student who is near a phone can contact
the campus police by dialing 624-2121, one patrol officer
is not adequate to ensure the safety of these people.

With additional officers, this crime may have been
prevented.

The Department‘ of Public Safety deserves to be
commended for their attempt to make the university
community aware of the situation, but it should also keep
in mind that prevention is its first priority. ‘

The present disorder in Yugoslavia shows what

happens when small and otherwise minor “states”,

like Croatia break contracts with their neighbors.
In 1918 Croatia not only agreed to join the other
South Slavs in creating Yugoslavia, but it insisted
that Serbia's reluctant head of state, Nikola Pasich,
do the same.
At that time the union of the Slavic states in
southeast Europe seemed the best

Grant Serbian territories freedom

staggering, the Serbs no longer object to the
breakup of Yugoslavia.‘ They have every reason to
be displeased with Croatia. Not only did the Croats
betray their fellow Slavs during World War II
(Serbs, Macedonians, Poles, Czechs, Slovaks,
Russians, Carpatho-Russians, Ukranians and others)
by denouncing their Slavic origins and marching
with the Germans, but even more distressing, they

way to protect all from foreign
hegemony.

In addition, for the Croats, A
creating Yugoslavia provided a

  Scott
Winovich

have continued to engage inan
extensive mud—slinging campaign
ever since. While Nazi Germany
and Imperial Japan lost the
military war of the 19403 only to

good way to avoid paying war
reparations to the United States, Serbia and the
other Allied nations that they had fought against
during the Great War. Like the states of America

.. before them, the kingdoms of Serbia and

Montenegro, along with the regions of Macedonia,
Bosnia, Slovenia and Croatia, united to form a new
world entity: the kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and
Slovenes.

Contemporary Croatia, however, resembles the
slave-owning South of pre-Civil War America.

First, its leadership has decided that preserving
the Yugoslav union is no longer in Croatia’s best
interest. and has thus unilaterally declared its
secession. ,

Second, the leadership in today's Croatia
increasingly resembles its fascist predecessors of
World War II.

The Nazi-controlled Independent State of Croatia
attempted to achieve racial purity by encouraging
its own Ustashi killing squads to brutally murder
more than 500,000 Serbs, 60,000 Jews and 28,000
Gypsies.

Croatia’s current head of state, Franjo Tudjman,
has actually defended genocide as a natural and
useful tool for the propagation of racial and religious
superiority, publicly thanked God that his wife is
neither a Serb nor aJew and invited Croatia’s Nazi
war criminals —— condemned by the Nuremberg
[rials — back to their fatherland not onlylto live in
peace but to be honored as esteemed veterans.
T udjman won last year’s election by a landslide.

Minority groups in Croatia — especially the 1.2
million Serbs and the many Italians who live» in
Istria and Trieste (most of which was stolen by Tito
in the 1940s and '50s and gifted to Croatia) — fear
Tudjman as much as any Catholic, Jew or African-
American would fear violence in an active enclave
of the Ku Klux Klan.

Justice screams for Yugoslavia’s presidency to
follow President Lincoln's lead and forcibly preserve
the union (which was, after all, the brainchild of
Croatia) and then to use the federal army in backing
up Yugoslavia’s federal judiciary as it wipes out
discrimination in Croatia.

Although their investment in Yugoslavia — both
in terms of lives lost and finances spent —— is

 

win the economic ‘ war of the
1980s and ’90s, Nazi Croatia lost the military war of
the 1940s only to make a bid at winning the public-
relations war of the 1990s.

They have hired professional ‘PR ﬁrms to defame
their neighbors, the Serbs and Montenegrins, and
are attempting to create an atmosphere wherein
they could freely suppress the minority rights of the
Serbs, Italians, Hungarians and Gypsies, who live
in those areas still under Croatian domination and
hegemony. Serbia is not amused.

Seventy years of pent-up martyrdom has pushed
Serbia into relinquishing the noble vision of a South
Slav’ melting pot — inspired by U.S. President
Woodrow Wilson — and to declare its indifference
over what Croatia becomes or where it goes.
Nevertheless, all those Croatian extremists who
first slaughtered hundreds of thousands of innocent
Alliedcivilians during World War II escaped to the
West and rewrote their own history and now seek
to blacken the name of the Serbs, should take
caution.

Croatia is free to go, but all Serbian territories
within Croatia that seek union with Serbia must be

' extended the same right of self—determination. _

The 1.2 million Serbs who live in Croatia will
never rest otherwise. (The Croatian government
insists that only 600,000 Serbs live in Croatia. This
figure, however, comes from the 1980 census,
wherein many Serbs declared themselves to be
Yugoslavs. , ’

According to the 1990 census, there are over 1.2
million Serbs in the Serbian Krajina region of
Croatia.) These Serbs have _the support of all the
Serbs throughout Yugoslavia.

If the Croats insist on forcing so many frightened
people into becoming part of the “new” Croatia,
they face the possibility of a backlash which could
leave thousands of Croation troops dead and end
up costing much unnecessary pain and suffering.

Croatia is free to go, but the Krajina wants out of
Croatia. Given the value of the real estate involved,
the Croats would be fools to resist.

Showcase Editor

   

Yo, I remember when “Me,
Myself And I” first dropped, and
I knew De La Soul was something
big. When the album 3 FeetHz'gl7
And Rising fell, that was it; no
one was bustin’ grooves like that,
ever. De La was a revolution.
And that’s the way it stayed for
about a year or so; “Say No G0”
was still slammin’, and “Buddy”
came crazy late with ‘a hype
remix, and clubs were all over it.
But then new vinyl from Paris, A
.»Tribe Called Quest, Brand
Nubians and others took charge,
and De La started to slip. It was
two years later, and the soul was
still unaccounted for, and 3 Feet V
High had no where else to rise.
Then “Ring, Ring, Ring” fell out
tha sky and dented many skulls,
and De ‘La was back. i

I was in Las Vegas when De La
Soul 15 Dead hit tha racks, and I
remember droppin’ the evening’s

Meadowlands program sol could
lay in a big Bally’s bed listenin’ to
tha new.

The rest of the summer zipped

A funky peace of mind with De La Soul.

MB Bookings bid farewell vvith bonanza(s)

Staff Writer

Two nervous and tense phone dialings,
an “I’ll be over,” and soon the editor of
one such Showcase section is high-

steppin’ in mid—’80s, ankle-high Nike "

hightops at my front door. I inquire
about foresaid footgear. He replies, “I
waz playin’ ball, shootin’ hoops.” He
hands me a fat package of alleged press
bufoonery and begins his spiel about the
beauty and stonedness of_ Monster
Magnet. 1 agree, then pose, “When do
you need this?” He ignores and proceeds
to whitebot me through the raps he saw
in NYC that weekend. “When?” I say. He
shrugs, “Uh, tomorrow morning.”
Thanks.

And so begins the last week of Greg
Panchisin (i.e. MB Bookings) that will
give to you the palatable offerings of
three — yes, three — all together and
differently separable shows in his last
week of existence. From urban disco/
grind-to—national-rawk rock to word, it’s
all here in one week of last-ditch blowout
for your ears to soak.

Strike one: This brings us two noteable

Brits with a beat, the U.K.’s Head of David. O

techno-gizmo ensembles: Foetus and Ruin has transformed what was once a
DieWarzau. Foetus is the project/hickey synthetic-like unit into a powered—out
of onejim Thirwell——er, Clint Ruin. Mr. “rock” thing in the last several years. '

Whether it’s been Foetus Corruptus,
Interuptus or the All New Nude revue,
Ruin and Co. have put torch to wax and
burnt fat holes through the whole genre
that lets the computer do the walkin’.
Live, the band will feature ex-Swans
Algis Kizys (now with Of Cabbages And
Kings) and Norman/westburg as well as
former Cop Shoot Cop dial-turner Dave
Ouimet.

Obviously not fearing to tread on land,
such heavies OCAK and the Cops stand
tall upon and slightly other—side~of—the—
nickel lie Die Warzau. They represent
that growing constituency of danceable,

; _. By Larry Chough

 

Staﬂ‘ Writer

The folks at WPTS are celebrating their seventh annual
Birthday Bash this Saturday, Nov; 9, at Graffiti, and you're all
invited to attend. The bash offers a triple~bill show with the local
1 Pittsburgh band, the Distractions, the Frampton Brothers and the
national recording act, Toad the Wet Sprocket.

To celebrate the birthday bash, WPT S has invited: bassist,
keyboardist and vocalist Dean Dinning; drummer Randy Guss;
guitarist and vocalist Todd Nichols and guitarist and
mandolin player Glen Phillips, all of whom comprise Toad the
Wet Sprocket, which will headline the show.

The Santa Barbara-based band has recently released its third
album under Columbia Records, titled Fear.

“We've been billed as being kind of alternative, but I don't
know if that’s really accurate,” said Nichols. “Our music is an
alternative to normal Top 40, but other than that I’d just say that
the way we’ve recorded has maybe been alternative.”

Toad the Wet Sprocket has released two prior independent

“I’m like you; I’m always on the

verge of death.”

“How'd you guess?”
Quips like that typify all of the

characters in Raul Ruiz’s The

Golden Boat. Some are closer to

the verge than others. .

Inspired by American police

television and soap operas, Boat
beats ‘em all down. Thinking the
worst, we imagined a combo of

“Car 54, Where Are You?” and
“The Bold And The Beautiful.”
It's all that and more. Throw in
Daniel Clowes’ surreal plot

structure and characterization,

Scorcese’s A/lerHours ramblings
with the pacing of Evil Dead 2,
and you ’ve got a pop noir comedy
(black plot comedy for yunz
bilinguals) for the '90s (as the,
trailer advertises).

“This is director Ruiz’s first U.S.
release after over 40 ﬁlms in
foreign lands. Drawing on a
gaggle of New York downtown .
shakers, including composerjohn
Zorn (who scored the sound),.'

manifested in the devoutly
warped Doc (Brett Alexander)
and an avenging Don Brockett
look—alike, Austin (Micheal Kirby),
who seems to drop in like a bad
uncle.

Caught in the bizarre love
triangle between Doc, Austin and
the slinky Mexican soap star
Amalia (Kate Valk) hangs Israel
Williams (Federico Muchnik), a
Village Voice rock critic—slash—
philosophy student. Austin is a
poetic, homeless assassin;
representative of death and
indeed is immortally dying like
some greek god,- perpetually
kniﬁng himself and everyone else.
“You’re bleeding all over the
place, but you never die,’? says a
potential victim. “These things
happen,” he deadpans.

Doc, a scotch-stashing street
surgeon, is the symbolic image of
numb, God—fearing faith in Good.
Dig this: “God is a virus. There’s
no way to kill him. He pretends
he’s dead, and then there he is
again. It's so beautiful.”

Enough analysis, and on to
some action, which this ﬂick
doesn't lack.. -

Israel literally “walking in
everyone’s footsteps” until he
comes upon Austin, down-and”-

the beginning of a beautiful and
terrifying friendship. Israel moves
on, tagged by Austin, who,
unprovoked, knifes anyone who
he feels deserves it.

And then there’s Amalia,
hounded by lunatics but perhaps
harried most by her paranoid,
Maxwell Smart of a husband,
Tony, played brilliantly by
Michael Stumm.

She is the source of everybody’s
pain —even the seemingly
impartial Israel — Everyman; you
‘n’ me ‘n’ we.

Don't take us or Ruiz that
seriously. There’s enough good
ol’ satiric schlock here to keep
you quoting for days: “I know
you’re gonna love the sushi dog,”
and on and ‘on, The real humor is
the spontaneity of the dialogue.
Stuff comin’ outta left field.

Ruiz’s cinematography hops
between color (the soap section)
and black and white (the Bogart
spiel.). Distracting?_ Maybe.
Pretentious? Nah  6 '

All and all, Ruiz has landed
large in the New York downtown-
cinema scene with a brutally
violent caricature of some of the

albums, “Bread and Circus”
and “Pale,” prior to being
signed to Columbia Records.
Credited for offering a blend
of rock and folk music With
often poignant and thoughtful
lyrics on the earlier albums,
the band decided to go one
step further than capturing
the live atmosphere of their
music and take on more pre-
production steps toward more

. elaborate arrangements.

Thetband formed in 1986
and adopted its unusual name
from a Monty Python skit,
and after gaining the attention
of major record labels with its
own independently recorded
and sold cassettes in the Los
Angeles area, the band signed
with Columbia in 1989.

Since the band started, it
has attracted a loyal following.
The members stress an
intimate relationship with
their fans. ,

“We got one letter from a
girl who said that our music
kept her‘ from committing

A suicide,” Dinning said.— “That’s

pretty heavy. It weighs a real
responsibility on you.” .
Phillips summed up the
band’s attitude by saying, “We
make our music to make
ourselves happy;° that’s the
core of it. That some of our
songs have special meaning
to some people, well, that
takes care of whatever guilt
‘ any of us may feel about
making a living writing songs
and playing music. We’d be
doing this if it didn’t touch
anybody. The fact that it does
makes it more worthwhile.
lt’s like we’re really creating
something. We’re giving
something back.”

bass and drums sewn together
purrfectly at each seam makes
for dense rock with no escape
routes. Last year’s Roundhouse

‘was an okey—dokey debut LP

and the recently released jacleson
feels even better. Guitars buzz

minimalist-rock lessonry that

jacks like Leaders Of The New
School, who have reworked rap
back to high school wit’ much

An image was created, one De

thus the title De La Soul Is Dead.
As Posdonus puts it about how
the Da I.S.Y. (it stands for da

misrepresented: “People were.

the Da I.S.Y. age does not exist,
talkin’ about flowers or whatever,

— they try to make it seem like
dat. I guess we’re putting De La
Soul aside, which is saying De La
Soul is dead, ‘cause people put
us with one with the Da I.S.Y.
age.”

with their culture.” In a world
where everyone is trying to be
harder than the next, De La made
it hip to be the opposite without
even wanting to. Says Maseo, “I
don’t think we’d ever do a song
where we’d come out and say,
‘We are brothers’ or ‘we are
Africans.’ So I guess it’s just a
sense of mind, a frame of mind
that just comes out in little bits
and pieces.” .
De La Soul (Posdonus, Trugoy
the Dove and P.A. Mase) is
another piece of the puzzle from
(strong) Long Island, home to
Eric B., EPMD and Public Enemy
— all acts that came out slammin’
on their maiden releases, creating
new styles for others to perpetrate.
And De La did it, too, proving
that ya don’t gotta be hoe-
slammin’ and crotch—grabbing
hard to be funky.

Now it’s the NOW step. The Da
I.S.Y. age is officially over,
although its dent will be
permanently marked in hip—hop.
The NOW step, the “Shwing—
alokate,” as in the fly jam on De
La Soul [5 Dead, the latest wax.
When Dead dropped, it wasn’t as
blatant as 3 Feet High. It was
subtle funk — sum’en not quite
as groundbreaking but still hype
and groovydeep in tha funk.

Regardless, that was way back
in late May, and the wax is still
bumpin’, and De La is headed to
the house oftha ‘Burgh. So till De .
La drops some new wax to turn
us all out, we gotta hold onto
what they givin’ out. ‘

Rutgers brings struggling of ense into Pitt Stadium

Asst. Sports Editor

 

  

It should be pretty easy for the
Pitt defense to prepare for Rutgers
this week.

After all, the Scarlet Knights’
offense is very similar to Pitt’s
both in terms of patterns and
results. “They started fast like us,”
said Pitt head coach Paul Hackett.
“They have struggled recently.
They did a very fine job in the first
half against Penn State, but from
that point on they’ve been
somewhat of an erratic team.”

Take out the words “Penn State”

and substitute “Syracuse,” and
those particular statements could
easily apply to the Panthers.
Rutgers’ offensive output has
ranged from 40 points against
Maine to three points last week
versus West Virginia University.

Rutgers -definitely has been
struggling of late. It has scored

1,, just 10 points in the previous two
News games, and the team has lost
three straight. Injuries have also

been a factor, limiting the depth
at receiver and the offensive line
as well as affecting the
quarterback, T om T arver. But
head coach Doug Graber does
not plan to change anything for
this week’s game. “No, I think
that’s the worst thing you can
do,” Graber said. .

The offensive leader has been
the senior signal-caller, Tarver.
He has been naggedby injuries
which have limited his mobility
but has still managed a solid
season, statistically. Coming into
the game, T arver has completed
over 52 percent of his passes for
1,548 yards and seven
touchdowns but has also been
intercepted 13 times. “T om T arver
is a more experienced player,”
Hackett said, “and he appears to
be a more confident player.”

Tarver’s backup is a player
who Pitt fans should remember.
In last year’s game Derek McCord
came off the Knights’ bench in
the second half and tossed three
touchdowns. The junior has not
started a game this year but he
has seen some action and could
play Saturday, depending on
Tarver’s condition _ and
performance. “Neither. one are
mobile players,” Graber_said.
“[Tarver’s injury] has greatly
reduced his effectiveness, and
we’re not sure what we’re going
to do with that spot this week.

We played both of them against ‘

West Virginia, and we may do
the same this week.”

Like Pitt, Rutgers can run and
pass, but Rutgers has more
success in the air. The Scarlet
Knights average over 187 yards
passing and just 108 on the
ground despite having a big
backfield. Tailback ‘Antoine
Moore is 215 pounds, while
fullback Tekay Dorsey weighs in
at 220. Dorsey ran well against
the Panthers last year, but the
team has yet to put together a
200—yard rushing effort all season.
They managed a meager 34 yards
rushing against Syracuse. '

The offensive line has been
solid, but the injury bug has
struck there, too. Guard Joe
Ciaffoni should miss Saturday’s
game with. an ankle injury he
suffered against Syracuse.

But_ Graber can take some
consolation in the fact that, as a
unit, the line has more seniors
than any other position on the
team. Of course they only have
two, but they are both on the
right side, so expect Rutgers to
run that way. Tim Christ and
Allen Mitchell both weigh over
290 pounds on that right side,
and the addition of a tight end on
the end of the line makes it a
formidable group. '

The receivers have also been
nicked a bit, but Gary Melton’s
hand injury should be healed in
time to play this week. Melton
and James Guarantano give
Tarver and McCord two
possession-type targets
downﬁeld.

Guarantano is the favorite
receiver by far, having hauled in
51 passes so far this year, which
is tops in the Big East. Rutgers
does throw to its backs fairly
often, utilizing screens a lot.

Panthers face attacking Rutgers defense

By Derek Willis
Asst. Sports Editor

The Rutgers defense, lousy in
past years, is bad no longer.
Instead, it is nasty.

Utilizing a strong linebacking
corps and an attacking secondary,
the Scarlet Knights have been
shutting down many of their
opponents. While they have given
up 42 points to Duke and 37 to
Penn State, they have also limited
Syracuse to 21, Michigan State to
seven and Boston College to 13
points.

“They play so hard," said Pitt
head Coach Paul Hackett. .“They
Come after you; they attack you
the whole time.”

In the pastothe Pitt offense has
rolled up some impressive
numbers against Rutgers. Just a
year ago the Panthers put 45
points on the board, scoring six
touchdowns. The scores of other
games in this series produced a

 general trend: 46-29, 38-10, 52-6,

   

17-0, 20-6. By the way, Pitt has
never lost to Rutgers.

But this year Rutgers has beaten
some teams it was not expected

to. And while it has not been V

consistent on offense, the defense
has been a steadying influence

for second-year head coach Doug
Graber. Currently ranked 23rd in
the nation in total defense, Rutgers
is allowing 310 yards a game.
This is Somewhat surprising
when you consider that the
defense is so young and injury-
depleted. Two senior
cornerbacks, Ron Allen and Ron
Bugg, are out after suffering
injuries in recent weeks. And
three more defensive players went
down last week against West
Virginia: defensive linemen Kory
Kozak and Darren Howell and
linebacker Elnardo Webster,
Webster, who is listed as
doubtful for Saturday’s contest, is

_ the Knights’ leading tackler with

72, including 46 solo stops.
Webster also has six sacks this
season. According to Graber,

Webster has a rotator cuff injury _

and might not practice all week.
If he is unable to perform game
day, it would be a big loss for
Rutgers. His backup, sophomore
Josh Hedgeman, has one tackle.

Webster’s counterpart at
outside linebacker is Shawn
Williams, who is also enjoying a

banner season. Williams ranks _

second in tackles, with 65, and
has a remarkable 51 solo stops.
Williams also leads the team with

11 sacks.

“In Webster and Williams, they
have two of the best outside
linebackers we’ll face this year,”
Hackett said. _

Another anchor on the defense
is sophomore strong safety Malik
Jackson, who started as a first-
year Knight last year. Jackson
was one of the nation’s top recruits
two years ago and today is a force
in the secondary. Jackson has 6]
tackles (third On the team) along
with ﬁve pass deflections and
one interception. At‘ 6—feet, 1-
inch and 218 pounds, Jackson is
a fierce hitter and is almost always
around the ball.

The front line is young and
thin, but the linebackers make
most of the tackles anyway. The
main job of Andrew Beckett, Mike
Spitzer and Ken Bryant is to
occupy the offensive line and
allow Webster and Williams to
wreak havoc. Again, if Webster is
unable to play, it creates an extra
burden on the front three. Beckett,
who is also slightly banged—up,
and Spitzer are sophomores,

while Bryant is a fIrst—year player.

The secondary will be hurting
without the two experienced
corners, but it is_ not a "ball-
hawking group anyway, with only
eight interceptions.

Marshall Roberts leads the team
with three picks, but the other
corner, redshirt freshman Keith
Price, is inexperienced. Free safety
Jay Bellamy has 30 solo stops,
but he is not a tough hitter like
Jackson.

Jackson’s brother, Jamil, and
Todd Lane are the inside ‘backers
who round out the defense. Both
are solid but unspectacular
players who are similar in size
and style of play.

This squad has put up some
impressive numbers against some
quality opponents, but if it is

forced to play without Webster.

and a few other defensive leaders,
the Scarlet Knights could be in
some trouble. -

The bright side is that this group
is not overly talentedbut simply
plays hard every minute of every
game.

 ; E.P-4&. I
  jermozine Williams eme

By Brandy L. Simms
Staﬁ’ Writer

It’s been an up-and-down
season for the 1991 Pitt Panthers.
They began the campaign with
five straight victories and hopes
of a New Year’s Day bowl. Now
with four straight losses, those
hopes have suddenly gone sour.

After falling to Notre Dame

back on Oct. 12, the Panthers

bounced back with an impressive
performance against Syracuse the
following wee k. However

' Syracuse scored a touchdown in

the ﬁnal minute and escaped Pitt
Stadium ‘with a 31-27 victory.

East Carolina was Pitt's next
opponent. But once again the
Panthers fell to defeat in the final
seconds and lost 24-23. Saturday
they were trounced by Boston
College 38-12.

“I’ve been very, very proud of
how we-fought in the Syracuse

, game and East Carolina against

very_ good teams,” head coach
Paul I-Iackettsaid. “This past week
[Boston College] wanted it more
than we did. They went out and
took it to us in every phase of the
game, and we suffered the

consequences — a very painful
loss."

Against BC, there weren't too
many bright spots for Pitt. This
was a game that many players,
coaches and fans would like to
soon forget. But tailbackjermaine
Williams will probably remember
this game for a while. The redshirt
sophomore mshed for a career-
high 146 yards on 20 carries and
established himself as a force to
be reckoned with among Big
East Conference runners.

“I think his performance against
Boston College was outstanding,”
Hackett said. “He was breaking
tackles. He was running hard. He
was running around. I’m really
pleased with Jermaine right now.”

Last year Williams injured his
left ankle early in the fall camp
and was forced to watch from the
sidelines. This year he's getting a
chance to perform and show what
he can do. ’

‘‘I think Jermaine has been a
slow starter only because he didn't
play at all last year and the year
before he only played one game,”
Hackett said. “What we're seeing
now in the last couple of weeks

Continued from page P-2

Reserve Chris Brantley has two -

touchdown catches (as does’

Moore) to lead the team in that
category. ‘ V‘ _

The punting game is solid with
‘David Dunne, but he has kicked
the ball 58 times this season,
which indicates the inefficiency
of the offense at times.

With both these teams’ records
at 5-4 and their offensive
similarities, Hackett expects a tight
game. “I expect a fierce ball
game,” he Said. “A good, tough
game because we’re both pretty
much in the same situation.”

TEE PI'I'I' NEWS, Saturday, November 9, 1991

By Rob Pugliese
Staﬂ“ Writer

Look at any list of college
football’s top 1991 recruiting
classes, and you certainly won’t
find Pitt among them.

The recruiting “gurus” didn’t
expect any players from this class
to make an immediate impact,
but wide receiver Dietrich Jells
and tailback Curtis Martin are
two of the players who have
proven otherwise.

Panther head coach Paul
Hackett isn’t surprised that the
class of ’91 has reaped proﬁts and
disregards the preseason rankings
of his class.

“They look at it from a distance,”

.g§«Hackett said of the “experts”.
“They can’t get inside the style of

the offense, the opportunity, the
coaching. These people picked
Pitt for the right reasons. They
knew what their opportunity
would be here, that their style
would fit.”

Martin, from‘ Pittsburgh's

:$\Al.lc‘.erdice High School, won the

Most Valuable Player in the
Pennsylvania—Maryland Big 33
Football Classic this summer and
burst onto the scene at fall camp

injohnstown ready to contribute. ‘

“He came in ready to play —
not just to be a part of this football
team, but ready to play and to
win,” Hackett said.

“I thought I would make a
contribution to the team, but I
didn’t expect this much,” Martin
said. “I didn’t expect to even start

a game."

Martin impressed the coaches
from day one and earned the
starting tailback role after a huge
effort at Minnesota in which he
rambled for 170 yards on 18
carries, including a 36-yard
touchdown that lifted Pitt to a 14-
13 win. Martin was named the
Big East Offensive Player of the
Week for this performance.

The following week against
Maryland, Martin rolled to another
big day, finishing with 121 yards
on 23 carries and also pulling in
six receptions for 66 yards. But
on the first series of the Notre
Dame game, Martin limped off
with a sprained toe in his right
foot, which turned out to be
more severe than expected and
has prevented him from suiting
up for the past three games.
Martin’s injury has been a major
setback and hindered Pitt’s
rushing attack against both Notre
Dame and Syracuse. But another
first—year Panther, Tim Colicchio,
has stepped up with sophomore
Jermaine Williams to ease the
woes. Martin said his foot is
“feeling pretty good now” and he
should return for Saturday’s clash
with Rutgers.

This is welcome news to Pitt,
since Martin racked up 381 yards
on 71 carries for a 5.4 average
and two touchdowns before the
injury, placing him among the
top runners in the Big East.

Despite the injury, Martin has
continued to learn about the
offense and himself as a runner.

Martin credited running backs
Coach Skip Peete with taking a
lot of time to work with him.

“We watch film, and Coach
Peete points out things to me,”
Martin said. “He does anything in
his power to help us get better as
running backs. He’s one of the
finest running back coaches
anywhere. He’s the man that we
owe a lot of credit to.”

Martin said he believes the

Panthers’ young group of backs 2

will mature into a fine corps and
lend strong depth to this spot,

one this team is usually lacking N:

in.
“If one goes down, we won’t
have to worry about the other
picking up the slack,” he said.
Martin, Colicchio _and Vince
Williams and sophomores
Jermaine and Kevin Williams form
a close—knit group that pushes
each player to improve. Martin

As Pitt and Rutgers square
off for Saturday's game with
identical S-4 records, Pitt fans
are probably thankful that
college basketball season is
upon us. Pitt basketball is a

. greatway for the fans to drown
their sorrows from the last
month of Pitt football. It would
seem the fans aren’t the only

_'ones disappointed, however.

’ Football head coach Paul
Hackett came down hard on

- the players also — by running
them through some extra drills
this week. ‘

Comparing the second
month of the season and the
first month of the season is
definitely comparing night and
day. But what if Pitt had lost its
first four games and then won
its next five for a 5-4 record up
to now? Wouldn't this season
seem to be not so bad instead
of being a big disappointment?
There are still two games left,
and if Pitt wins one of them, it
will end up with a winning

Stephen
Flin n

record. If Pitt should manage to
beat Penn State, the season will
be judged as successful by Pitt
fans. So all is not lost.

Right now the Panthers must
consider’ this a two-game season
with their record being 0-0 and
the possibility of becoming 2-0. If
they can accomplish that, this
season can still be considered a
success, considering what they
had to work with. Remember this
is not only a young team when
considering the players, but it is
also ' a young team when
considering the coaches. This is
Paul Hackett’s first head—coaching
job, so he still has a great deal to
learn about being a college~
football head coach. The youth
and inexperience of both players
and coaches has really shown all
season at Pitt.

\Vait and see about Pitt football

The Minnesota game and
the Maryland game were
victories which could just as
easily have been losses on the
last plays of the games. On the
same note, the Syracuse loss
and the East Carolina loss could
just as easily have been wins if
it weren’t for the last few
minutes of the games. It seems
the coaching staff needs to
work on analyzing the other
teams’ strengths and
weaknesses during the games.
This was apparent in more
than one loss this season, when
Pitt’s» opponents were
successful in running the same
few plays the entire game.

If you recall, last year’s
meeting with Rutgers was
probably Pitt's best
performance. Hopefully that
will be an omen for this week's
game, but we’ll just have to
wait and see. That was the
sentiment for every Pitt football
game this year: Just wait and
see.

the backs.

“The freshman group is close,"
Martin said.

“We’re all team players, and
the sky’s the limit for us when we
play as a team. We don’t compete;
it’s a team thing. We’re all just
like brothers. We like to see the
others do well. If I mess up,4I like
to see one of the other guys pick
up the slack for me.”

“Curtis is a detail guy. He wants

to learn everything he can,”'

Hackett said.

“Curtis isn’t gonna let an injury
slow him down from his
development. ”

Jells came out of Erie's Tech
Memorial High School carrying
the label of a burner, but he
wasn’t pegged as a big-impact
player.

He started very slowly, but he
improves as each week passes
and has a promising future.
Although he had problems
catching the football early on, he
never lost confidence in himself.

down,” Jells said. “That wasn’t a
problem with me.”

“This young man brought to us
a dimension of speed we have
not had on this team,” Hackett
said.

“He’s gotten more and more 0

involved in the offense and has a
marvelous future here."

Jells began the season on the?‘
sidelines for all but a couple

plays each game.

Hackett then jumpedjells’ time
up to seven or eight plays a
game, then 20 plays per game
until last week against Boston
College, when Jells participated
in 40 plays.

Hackett said that 35 or 40 plays
would be the maximum number

‘ ~a

forjells because a player with his 

type of speed needsto remain
fresh at all times.

“I've progressed a lot,” Jells
said. ‘

“When I first came in, I didn’t
know anything. I couldn't read a
coverage or anything, but I've
learned. It’s just been a matter of
time.” '

Jells has just five receptions,
but they’ve gone for 172 yards

(21.5 avg) and two long,

touchdowns: a 46—yarder against
Minnesota and a 58-yard score
against Maryland.

The Panthers have yet to design
any special plays to get Jells the
ball and haven’t used him on any
screens. .

He onlycarried the ball on one
reverse, and one safety blitz
ruined that, but the time will
come over the next three years
when Jells will be a featured
weapon in the offense.

“We want to be sure to build
confidence,” Hackett said. “We’ll
continue to search for ways to get
him the ball.”

“I just try to prepare myself for
this year and try to learn the
offense for now,” Jells said. “I
haven't reﬁned all of my abilities
yet.” A

These offensive weapons and
inside linebacker Tom Tumulty

(75 tackles) have made this classjgi, 4

a pleasant surprise.

“These guys have just leaped
into the middle of it,” Hackett
said. “They're gonna do nothing
but get better.”

“I think the freshman class is
doing great,” Jells said. “I don’t
think the expectations were this
high. I’m not sure if any of us
thought we’d be in this position.”

Hackett is looking forward to

_ building Pitt's program around

these players and recruits wit%r

the basic philosophy of giving a
first—year player an immediate
chance to contribute. V
‘ “If you want an opportunity,
come to Pitt,” he said. “We’re
gonna give guys a chance. We’re
gonna let guys go."

“It’s definitely exciting for me
that I’ll be part of the future,” Jells
said. “I think he’s put all the
weight on our shoulders to
succeed, and I think we’ll come
through with ﬂying colors."

.. Injured Bray to rem
    ' By Bob Maselli
E ' Sta_[}“Writer

It was business as usual for the
Pitt football team Wednesday
afternoon. The team was getting
ready for its game against Rutgers
on Saturday showing some mu ch-
needed intensity that was missing
last weekend.

All seemed to be normal, except
for one thing.

Senior linebacker Curtis Bray
wasn’t present for the afternoon
workout, and won’t be present
for this week’s game.

The Pittsburgh Press reported
yesterday that during ‘Sunday
practice, thenormally quiet, mild-
mannered Bray got into a shouting
match with assistant coaches Fred
vonAppen and Marvin Lewis
because Bray, who has arthritis
in his knees, reportedly was
having pain and couldn’t run.

According to the Press, both
Lewis and vonAppen told Bray

that if he did not run, he would

After Bray told vonAppen that
he didn’t play against Boston
College, he told Bray to leave the
field.

Lewis and vonAppen declined
comment on the matter, but head
coach Paul Hackett was willing
to speak after practice. According
to Hackett, he and Bray were to
meet last night to talk about the
matter at hand, and Hackett said
he hoped to have everything
resolved by the end of the
discussion. '

“I’m concerned, and he’s
concerned about the situation.
I'm disappointed, and he’s
disappointed about iwhat has
happened,” Hackett said. “I am
going to have a meeting tonight
with him and we are going to
work things out. It's questionable
whether he’s going to play this
weekend, but he will be back [on
the team].

“Right now our mind is on this
week’s game, and this is an
isolated case between the

coaches, myself and_Curtis. It’s a

such as Curtis, who is an asset to
this team as a leader and excellent

defensive player, is sidelined, and-

there and do anything about it,"

Hackett said. Bray did not play »

against Boston College last week
because of his injured hand

“When older guys can’t
contribute, things such as this
sometimes happen. Atleast he
gets a chance‘ to play, unlike
Ronald Redmon. [Redmon is out
for the rest of the season with a
foot injury.] This situation will
not affect the team at all. I do not
see any problems," Hackett
added.

At last night’s basketball game,
Bray said that he had met with
Hackett and that everything “went
well."

Jermaine."

As a true ﬁrst—year player in
1989, Williams contributed to a
team that finished the season 8-3-
1, including a 31-28 victory over
Texas A&M in the John Hancock
Bowl. That year he compiled 63
yards rushing on 12 carries. His
best performance came in the
season opener against Pacific, in
which he rushed for 33yards in
seven attempts, including an 18-
yard scamper. He was assigned
to return kickoffs and responded
by running back seven kicks for
114 yards. His longest kickoff
return was a 27-yard run against
Penn State. - _

This season Pitt has relied
heavily on its running game in
order to take some of the pressure
off quarterback Alex Van Pelt.
But the running game has been
hit hard with the loss of a couple
of key players. Williams has had
to carry muchof the load.

“He’s been in a tough,
competitive situation with Curtis,
and that’s good for him; And
Curtis has been out, and

Jerm‘aine’s made the most of it,”
Hackett said. '

‘Tony Dorsett

The 6-foot, 2-inch, 210-pound
tailback has scored three
touchdowns and leads the team
in rushing with 568 yards on 125
carries. He’s the Big East
Conference’s third-leading rusher
behind West Virginia’s Adrian

’Murrell and David Walker of

Syracuse.

“I just try to go out there and
work hard,” Williams said. “I
worked harder [this] summer than
I did the previous summer.”

The Pitt coaches are pleased
with his strength and size. They’re
also delighted that he’ll be around
for a couple of more years.

“I think nowjerrnaine is coming g

into his own,” Hackett said. “I
think now as you look toward
next year, now you’ve got a guy
who’s back into the swing of
things.”

If Williams continues to perform’

like he did in the BC game, he’ll
get a chance to see‘ more action.
and Craig
“Ironhead” Heyward are just two
of the several tailbacks that have
donned the Pitt uniform.

» “Pitt was always known as a

good running—backs school,” ..

Williams said. ”I just want to keep
up the tradition.”

Pitt ﬂies by Canadian tem in exhibition romp

By Derek Wﬂlis
Asst. Sports Editor

Darren Morningstar had 19
points and four steals, leading
the Pitt basketball team to a 103-
67 exhibition victory over a
touring Canadian National team
last night at Fitzgerald Field
House.

The Panthers unveiled a tight
pressure defense which garnered
16 steals and forced 31 turnovers.
Pitt also enjoyed a 43-29
advantage on the boards.

Sophomore transfer Eric
Mobley added 13 points in 12
minutes of play. Ahmad Shareef
had 12 points, and Gandhijordan
had 11. Al Kristmanson led the
Canadians with 15.

“We had a lot of kids do a lot of
pretty good things,” said head
coach Paul Evans. “I was pleased
with their effort, but it's a
preseason game, and they’re not
the kind of competition we’ll be
facing in a couple of weeks.”

Ten players saw over 10

minutes in court _action;
Morningstar led with 26 minutes.
Evans credited the frontcourt of
Morningstar, Mobley, Chris
McNeal and first-year player
Orlando Antigua with good
defensive play. “No one here is
going to play the whole game,”
said point guard Jerry
McCullough. “We have a good
rotation, and when we get out
there we give it all we got.”
Senior point guard Sean Miller
had nine points and five assists
and split time at the point with
McCullough, another first-year
player. McCullough finished with
10 points, six assists and two
steals. “[Evans] has been stressing
defense everyday in practice,”
McCullough said. “That was the
first thing that came to mind
when I stepped out on the court.”
The first half was a mix of
dunks, turnovers and fouls. The
Canadians had trouble with Pitt’s

effective in pressuring were
Jordan, Antigua, McCullough and
Shareef. The pressure created
numerous fast—break opport-
unities for the Panthers, which
led to many shots from short
range.

Shareef had two follow—up
slams, and Mobley had his first
two baskets — both dunks — in
the middle of the half. For the
first period Pitt shot 50 percent
from the field, while they limited
the Canadian team to just 37
percent. The visitors kept the
score close by hitting 12 of 13
free ‘throws before intermission.

The teams traded baskets for
most of the half, but Pitt was able
to put together a scoring spurt of
11 straight points midway through
the half. McCullough started the
run with a three—pointer and a
spinning layup in the lane. McNeal
and Antigua then hit baskets
before Miller finished the run
with a nifty running shot from the
baseline to give the Panthers a

Morningstar led the Panthers with
eight points at intermission, while

all six of his points in the second
period, while McCullough
grabbed both of his steals and
dished off two assists in a 54-

pounds, Bettis is like a huge
cannonball that builds
momentum and ﬂattens anything
its way. It won’t be long until he
eclipses the 1,000—yard mark. He
has 826 yards and 12 TDs with a
whopping 6.4 average per carry.
If that ain’t enough, he also pulled

V in four TD passes from Irish QB

Rick Mirer. Mirer is getting better
each week, and believe it or not,
No. 3 has surpassed a former No.
3, Joe Montana, in TD passes
thrown by a Dame gunslinger in
a single season. To make it simple,
Montana heaved 16, while Mirer
has connected 17 times in 9 games
this campaign. Mirer is dope. The
Irish running game might be the
nation’s strongest, rolling up much
damage and yardage week after
week, while Mirer continues to
make the right decisions when
throwing.

The Vols have held the
opposition to 3.3 yards per carry
and boast a devastating pass-
rush. Tennessee will benefit
significantly if they force Mirer
into definite passing situations
on third down for two reasons.
First, the Vol secondary is very
solid with the likes of FS Dale
Carter and CB Jeremy Lincoln
and should blanket the ND
receivers. Secondly, the Vols have
been deploying a new pass—rush
scheme, in which they insert four
defensive ends into thelineup at
once.

Chuck Smith could be the finest
pass-rushing end in the nation.
Kacy Rodgershas been steady all
season, and Chris Mims has
shown no effects of a layoff since
returning from his suspension in
mid-September.

Newcomer Todd Howard
rounds out the fierce quartet.
They will pressure Mirer, and
he’ll take a pounding.

in the season it didn’t seem too

blown out of proportion.”

Bray said that he would not
play this weekend but expected
to be back at practice next week.

Despite Hackett’s comments,
the Pressalso reported the players
conducted a meeting yesterday
because they were upset with the
coaches’ treatment of‘ Bray. All
indications, though, seemed to
lean in Hackett’s direction, as
team enthusiasm and unity
between coaches and players
seemed strong on the practice
field yesterday. On that note,

Hackett expressed his approval '

at the team’s work yesterday,
saying, “We are looking good,
and things are working out well
on both sides.”

Bray, a Parade All—American
from Gateway High School in
Monroeville, came to Pitt in 1988,
and since his first days as a Panther

football player he has battled _

various ailments. He has always
had problems with his knees, but
last year he nursed an elbow

' injury, and most recently he has

had a practice injury which led to
a hand infection. '

big a deal with the Vols’ other
weapons, but lately it has hurt
big time. Florida picked him off
four times, and he already has
thrown 13 INTs against nine
touchdowns. But don’t discount
Kelly. His completion rate is still
solid at 64.5 percent, and 2,050
yards in seven games is
outstanding. Kelly ﬁred for 306
yards last week and has the
dynamic Carl Pickens ready for
this prime-time bustout.

Pickens appears relegated to a
distant third behind Desmond
Howard and Casey Weldon in
the Heisman race, but he deserves

major, major props, with over,

100 yards per contest. His
numbers are sure—fire All-
American: 38 catches, 702 yards,

18.5 avg., and four touchdowns. _.

If Pickens gets the mandatory
double or triple coverage, then

Kelly might have learned not to
force the ball into it, like at Florida.
If he forces the ball, the Vols
could find themselves frustrated,
but if he looks off to Craig
Faulkner (22 catches) and JJ.
McCluskey (24 catches), the ND
defense will be groping for
answers.

Unfortunately, this game is on
the Notre Dame Broadcasting,
Network, with the atrocious Bill
Walsh and the “Let’s go, Irish”
enthusiasm of Dick Enberg, so
we’ll have to suffer.

Tennessee has more offensive
versatility than any team the Irish
has faced this year. Look for a
high-scoring shindig in South
Bend, and if Kelly doesn’t throw
the ball to the Irish d—backs, UT
should avenge last year's loss.
Regardless, we’ll take Tennessee
and the numbers. Take the

Volunteers + 6 1/2.

(+9 1/2) Rutgers (5-4) at Pitt (5-
4), Saturday, 12:00.

Two teams desperate for a
victory meet at Pitt Stadium. As
we all know, except those who
have been out of the country,‘Pitt
started 5-0 but has dropped four
straight. Rutgers started 1-1, reeled
off four wins in a row, and then
dropped three straight. Both
squads are spiraling downward
fast.

To be_ honest, who knows what
these teams are going to do?
Both were blown off the field last
week. Boston College destroyed
_Pitt 38-12, while West Virginia
went into Giants Stadium and
smashed the Scarlet Knights 28-
3.

To make matters tougher,
Rutgers beat BC earlier in the
season, while Pitt smashed WVU

times, Hackett will run an injured
Jermaine Williams on a second
and 10 only to gain three. Then
on third and long, Van Pelt will
complete a pass for about five or
six yards, and Pitt will be forced
to punt by not throwing past the
marker.

We’ve seen this crap too many
times this year. Pitt needs their
‘backs to get healthy. Pitt hasn’t

‘had a healthy back in years,
despite having excellent depth
and talent at the position.

The last healthy back was
Curvin Richards, who replaced
the injured Adam Walker.

Pitt has to punch the ball past

_the pylon. They have failed to
capitalize when in the red zone
and have settled for too many
field goals, which cost them a

few games (Syracuse, East
Carolina). The key for Pitt the rest
of the way is gonna be ball control
— keepin’ their defense off the
field, for the above, obvious
reasons.

Rutgers comes in struggling and
battered. Mountaineer QB Darren
Studstill threw for a career—high
197 yards last week against Doug
Graber’s Knights.

Like Pitt, the Rutgers D is
woeful, as evidenced by Studstill’s
(monumental for him) day. QB
Tom Tarver threw for only 34
yards last week, and Rutgers hasn’t
scored an offensive touchdown
in 10 quarters, a stat they are sure
to break againstPitt.

If Tarver slips, look for Graber
to call on Derek McCord to run
the show.

McCord threw for three scores

against Pitt last year. Whoever’s
throwing the rock will have the
Big East's leading receiver, James
Guarantano to toss it to.
Guarantano has 51 catches, which
ranks him 14th in the nation.

‘ The Panthers are 8-0 all time
against the Knights and have
outscored ‘em 285-85 in the series,
although Rutgers has scored 50
of those points in the last two
meetings. Take Rutgers +9 1/2.

opponents and swallowed only
four rushing TDs all season, so
the Dawgs may need to take to
the air.

Georgia enters the clash ranked
22nd and looking to enhance its
bargaining position with the
major bowl scouts. Georgia lost a
tough 10-0 battle at Alabama
early, then bounced back with
three wins, punctuated by an
impressive 27-12 toasting of arch-
rival Clemson on national
television. Thenlthe Dawgs
suffered a bitter upset at the
hands of Vanderbilt, but last week
they cranked up the O in a 49-27
romp over Kentucky.

Remember this name: Eric

Zeier? Georgia has brought the
first-year player along slowly,
and he has played in only six
contests, but he has‘ looked very
good, especially against the
vaunted Clemson defense.

The Greek god Zeier has been
picked off just twice in 192
attempts and has connected 57
percent ofthe time for over 1,400
yards and six scores. His favorite
target is sensational soph Andre
Hastings.

Hastings was one of the most
highly recruited players in the
nation two years ago and snubbed
Notre Dame for Georgia.

Thus far he’s lived up to all I

that billing. Once Carl Pickens

"takes his game to the NFL,

Hastings will rise as the top gun
among SEC wideouts. He’s hauled
in 36 passes for 489 yards and
four T Ds so far, and like Pickens,
he can take it the distance at any
moment. . Tailback Garrison

‘Hearst is slammin’. He has

emerged as a big-time running
back with 640 yards and 6.5
yards per carry while scoring,
seven touchdowns.

The Dawg D is solid but not
spectacular. Linebacker Dwayne
Simmons is an All-American. If
he’s _not, then the voters should
be investigated. Simmons has 102
total tackles, including 59 solo. If
you missed Simmons’
performance when
singlehandedly devouring the
Clemson attack, you might have
missed the top defensive effort
by an individual this -year. The

. Butkus is a possibility.

Despite this, the Gators are all
that and more, much too much
for Georgia to handle.

Florida on ESPN makes for a
hot dawg in Georgia Coach Ray
Goff and another big night for
Matthews. Take Florida -12.

Eric Mobley’s first shot as a Pitt
Panther was a missed dunk off an
attempted alley-oop from Sean
Miller. '

His next attempt was a power
slam dunk following a missed
shot

Not much later Mobley grabbed
a rebound about three feet from
the basket and rose up for another
monster slam that showed the
purpose of the breakaway rim
and actually shook it out of place
brieﬂy.

Mobley enjoys dunking. His
 teammates enjoyed watching his

finest jam of the night, one that
left the Pitt bench howling with
delight and the Fitzgerald Field

He took a feed from Jermaine
Morgan and threw it down with
authority to punctuate Pitt’s 103-
67 thrashing of the Canadian
National Team.

The 6-foot, 1 1-inch sophomore
scored 13 points and grabbed
eight rebounds in just 12 minutes
of action.

All of his field goals came from
within inches of the rim. His
enthusiasm extended to the
defensive end of the floor as
well, but as expected he lacked
the polished results of a more
experienced big man, as he tried
to swat nearly every shot within
his range.

“I thought he had a good start,”
said Pitt Coach Paul Evans. “He’s
a kid that hasn't played much,
and he needed to get some
confidence and have some things

go his way.”

Mobley was just one of the
prominent new faces donning
the Panther uniform for the first
time.

First-year point guard Jerry
McCullough saw 17 minutes of
action and sparked the Panthers’
pressure defense, which forced
31 turnovers bythe Canadians.
McCullough excited the crowd,
running the offense with an up-
tempo pace that will be a Panther
trademark this season.

He finished with 10 points

-and six assists while playing very

tight defense, something he
concentrated on from the
moment he stepped on the floor.

“Coach has been stressing
defense everyday in practice for
three hours,” McCullough said.
“If you’re not up there in the

guy’s shorts, he’ll take you out.
So that was the first thing that
came to mind when we stepped
on the court, to play hard.”

McCullough stripped the
opposing point guard twice in
the open court, turning both
opportunities in to points for his
team.

First—year forward Orlando
Antigua also expressed the
importance of playing tough
defense.

“We weren’t really tight; we
just had a couple jitters,” Antigua
said. “We just wanted to come
out there and play hard defense,
and the rest would take care of
itself.”

Antigua and Chris Gant made
solid contributions to Evans’ deep
rotation in the absence of the
injured forward Antoine Jones.

Antigua scored five points,
including a three-pointer to close
the first half and grabbed three
rebounds, while Gant scored six
points to go with two boards.

“At first I was surprised that I ‘

was getting the open shot so
easily,” Antigua said. “That’s why
the first couple of shots I was
nervous shooting it, and I missed.
Most of us just wanted to get that
first game over with. I know
especially the freshmen did.”

He also said he felt the new
Panthers played well in their
debut.

“I think we did pretty good. We
made a lot of turnovers and a
couple of mistakes, but for the
first game I think we did pretty
good,” he said.
