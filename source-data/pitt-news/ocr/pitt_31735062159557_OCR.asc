The aforementioned fast buck could be made
by walking through the narrow, winding halls of
the Hall (the remodeled Palmer Hotel) and look-
ing for open doors. The open doors aren't hard to
find, either, for in two days of ’casing’ the dorm,
I found almost a score of rooms easily accessible
and with a wealth of tempting loot inside.

Although most DeSoto Hall residents lock
their doors when they leave to go to classes, it
is practically unheard of for a tenant to lock his
door if he is going to a buddy’s room for a card
game or down to play a game of ping-pong in the

cellar.
Theft Made Easy

Since the dorm is open most of the time, it is
‘simple for anyone who looks something like a
student to walk in and browse around. Newsboys,
too, circulate around the halls in the evenings.

The layout of the place is a point in any pro-
spective thief"s favor. The halls are dimly-lit,
and have many closets and corners. The_re are

EXPENSIVE PLAY -- DeSoto Hall students get some exer-
cise while their unlocked room exhibits some valuable loot for
any strolling stranger upstairs. The students’ property was ‘taken’

a thief, in this case.

Reporter Finds De Soto Thief’   Parad

DeSoto Hall, besides being a men's dormi-
tory, is also an easy haul for a man who wants

ise  

 

also numerous easily-reached exits. Thus, even
though an interloper might be questioned if seen,
he could easily find a place to hide or escape
through a convenient exit,

Proving the above points was not hard in the
two days I spent at DeSoto Hall. After obtaining
the permission of J. Edward Ricart, assistant
dean of men in charge of housing, I walked into
the dormitory and literally made myself at home.

No Questions Asked A

The only time I was questioned by anyone
was when I’ had a cameraman with me. On my first
visit I passed the janitor without question and
tried every door on the third floor—and no one
stopped me or asked me my business.

A wide open door lured me to one of the
‘rooms. I stopped in. Lying about the room were a
portable typewriter, worth about $100; aportable
radio, valued at about $50; a multitude of foun-
tain pens, a slide rule and books--all of which
would probably be valued near 340.

I picked up the typewriter and carried it out
of the building and then returned it without being
challenged. The fountain pens and slide rule I

WHERE’RE THEIR DINKS.

PIT

ﬂélll

 

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, PITTSBURGH, PA.

- Freshmen‘ Tom Erwin, Wat Zieg,

George Westerman, Ace O’Keefe, and Alex McRae, are a few of the
many whose dinks are stored in their pockets.

Freshmen Don’t Let Dinks Go

To Heads; Keep ’em Poeketed

Freshman dinks, ostensibly worn

~ on the head, are to be found in the

respective pockets ofl50 freshmen.
This fact was uncovered by Men's
Council orientation heads, Joe
Wolfe and Tom Burkhart, in a sur-
vey of freshman classes to deter-
mine why few dinks have been
seen on the campus. _
The survey was part of the in-
quiry into the success or failure
of the present orientation program.
Some upperclassmen report seeing
freshman wearing their dinks only
during the early part of the sem-
ester -- most have never seen one.
Burkhart and Wolfe found that
most of the freshmen carriedtheir
dinks with them, at least partly
refuting the idea that the new”frosh
are ignoring the “dink'edic.t. _
Commenting on the dink situation,
Edwin J. McIntosh, director ‘of
orientation, said that his office
has not yet determined the attitude

of the new frosh toward their dinks.

Last semester each freshman
answered a questionaire on which
one of the questions was "What
was your opinion of the wearing of
Freshman» Caps?” A typical reply
was that the caps were "a good
idea but the project was poorly
administered.”

This type of answer was unex-
pected , as McIntosh had anticipated
a negative response. The survey
convinced him that the frosh them-
selves have accepted the dinks
and now need only efficient ad-
ministration to insure everyday
wearing of the caps.

Last semester the dink program
was partly successful. At Ellsworth‘
Center it was almost a complete
success, said Mclntosh. There, the
upperclassmen knew all the frosh
and were able to enforce "dinks
for everybody.”

Heating, Light
Normal Again

Steaming radiators proclaim Pitt
heating back at normal. With the
settling of the prolonged national
coal strike Sunday night, Bellefield
boiler plant which supplies heat
to the University heating system
almost immediately began to pump
steam at normal flow into the
buildings on campus.

Raymond L. Coss, superintend-
ent of the Buildings and Grounds
department, reports that all restric-
tions have been lifted in the Uni-
versity. Necessity for the dimout
order throughout all Pitt buildings
has passed also since coal is now
available at Duquesne Light Co.
boiler plants.

In an effort toconserve dwindling
coal supplies, the University was
closed completely over the weekend.

At the height of the coal short-
age Bellefield boiler plant had to
cut heat to all Pitt buildings. Aux-
iliary boilers were started up in
Thaw and Alumni Halls to supply
heat to the upper campus.

In the Cathedral where the steam
was being felt heavily in corridors
and large rooms tle heating system
was connected to a gas boiler in

the basement of the building.

StudentCenter,FieldHouse,Gyni  
Assured by 5 Million “Dollar Loan

Construction of Pitt's field
house, student center, and gymna-
si’um—a large segment of the Uni-
versity's expansion program-—was'
assured late yesterday. A 

Chancellor R. H. Fitzgerald an-
nounced the completion of arrange- i
ments for financing these three
buildings _through a $5,000,000
mortgage loan from the New York
Life Insurance Company.

One million dollars will be ap-
plied to assume the debtinqurred
with the Mellon National Bank and
Trust Company, when the remain-

e ing unpaid bonds covering Pitt Sta- 

dium were refinanced Dec. 1,1949.
The remainder will be applied to
the three proposed structures.
Gradual Retirement Seen
Previously these buildings were
to be financed on a direct bond-
issue basis.

  

‘However, the University will now
pay for the buildings over a period
of years by gradually retiring the
mortgage. ‘

The University Fee, paid by the
students at registration, as well
as other receipts and University
income will be applied to a sinking _
fund to retirethe mortgage” bonds
at maturity.

Architects Delaying Start “

The bonds will pay 3% percent A
interest and will mature March 1,
1975. The old Stadium bonds (to
which the 331,000,000 was applied)
paid 6 percent interest. This inter-L [
est was met for 25 years.

According to the Chancellor, the
new buildings will be started as
soon as architectural plans are
completed. Much of the Pitt student
life will center around the three...
structures.

University authorities have been ,
contemplating using a part of the
Grace Memorial Church as a site
for a temporary student center. The
field house will filla need for prac-
tice space for athletic teams while
the new gym will take over for
Trees Gym, which is soon to be H
hospital, and the outmoded facil- 
within the Stadium. W

Formication, Plato, and babies
thrown over cliffs are just a few
things an inquirer bumps into when
curiousity prompts him to search
for the definitions of two strange
terms in the recent mercy-killing
fuss. A

The New Hampshire trial of Dr.
Hermann Sander, accused of mur-
dering cancer-patient Mrs. Abbie
Borroto by injecting air into her
issue involved. But "euthanasia”
and "air embolism” are becoming
a part of the American vocabulary.
Do you know the definition of
euthanasia and of air embolism,

 

the alleged cans of Mrs. Borroto’s
death?

Air-embolism is defined by the
American Illustrated Medical Dic-
tionary as: a condition found in
aviators who rise to high altitudes,

nitrogen in the blood and spinal
fluid.

Symptoms are: "rash, pain in the
joints and lungs, neuritis and for-
mication.” Formication is "a sen-
sation like that produced by ants
and other insects crawling over the
skin.”

Maybe Mrs. Borroto’s death wasn’t.
so peaceful, huh?

Greeks find a Word

«Most everyone could tell you
now that euthanasia is a synonym
for mercy-killing, the act of putting

a suffering human out of his misery.

"Twas not always so.

The Greeks of antiquity from
whom we borrowed the word gave
it a very different meaning, butﬂthe
idea of mercy-killing itself was not
unknown to them.

In Greek, "eu” -meaning "well”
and "thanatos”
were combined to mean "being hap-
py and opportune in the time of
one’s death,” according to the En‘-.
cyclopedia Americana. The related
Greek adjective was applied to the
man who died for his country.

State-enforced euthanasia in the

rmodern sense was actually prac-

tised in the ancient Greek state of
Sparta. Plutarch says, "The father
had no authority to tear the child.”

that can be bought only in Canada
for the small price of a quarter. It
was full of original features that
have appeared only three times be-

Would you like to attend class

to use quill pens and homemade

Ex-German Fraulein

Terms U.S. Wonderful’

By ELIZABETH KNOX:

, His fingers touched the familiar notes of Pitt's Alma Mater,
but his thoughts centered on the pretty, blue-eyed German girl
near him. ~Cliff Harmon, staff-sergeant with the American Army
of Occupation, glanced again across the Red Cross recreation

Startled, the sergeant watyched as
she hurried to the piano and ex-
plained: "Thatis our German Na-
tional Anthein, and it is forbidden
since the war ended.”

Not one to waste an opport_unity,
Cliff laughingly informed her that
it also was the tune of his univer-
sity’s AlmagMater, and, if she were
interested, he'd certainly like to
teach her the words. ‘

Good Reason to Sing

Today that same German girl,
Eve Althaus, sings Pitt’s Alma
Mater with good reason; she is a
student here.

Although sure that Pitt was the
most confusing thing in the world
on the first day of spring semester
classes and still dreading the ele-
vators, Evé is “overjoyed.” En-
rolled as a special student,‘ she is
taking two English courses and one A
in shorthand, but her favorite is
speech. - ,

Born in Berchtesgarden, which
is well-known as the site of Hitler’s
summer home, Eve attended a Cath-
olic boarding school and received
an education comparable to a high
school graduate’s. There she learned
the King’s English which, she ad-
mits, hadn’t much appeal for her
then. It was after the war while
working as an information clerk for
the American Red'Cross in Dachau
that she learned to speak English
well.

and Brutus, although their reasons
are different, all conspire against
him.

The costumes for the play,rented
from a New York costumer, will be
Elizabethan "in style, since plays
in Shakespeare's time were done in
costumes of the day.

Veteran Players

Most of the leading characters in
“Caesar” will be portrayed by
veteran Players. ]ack Ingrim, who
plays Caesar, has appeared before
in "George Washington Slept Here,”
“Dark of the Moon,” and "The
Flies.“ '

Cassius will be played by Mel
Silver who appeared in “Philadel-
phia Story” and had the lead in
"Dark of the Moon.” p

This will be the first Players
production for Dick Costanza who
plays Brutus.
S ]a.ck Schano who portrays Mark

who is also active with the Y-
Triangle Players.

Three Women in Cast

The only women in the cast are
Elaine Teifield, Diane Dimon, and
Gloria Brodie as Portia, Calpurnia,
and Lucius, respectively. Miss
Brodie, who played Barbara Allen
in “Dark of the Moon,” plays a
boy in “Caesar” since the charac-
ter is very young and his voice has
not yet changed.

day run, “Caesar” will tour to
Brentwood, Etna, Braddock, and
other neighboring localities.

Renovated ‘Pill Rollers’
Join School Socially

By BERTRAM KATZ .9
Though remote from the thoughts and knowledge of most Uni-
versity students, the pill rolling boys and girls of the School of
‘Pharmacy know Pitt in the form of the renovated mansion that has
become as much a part of the University as the Commons Room or

Foster Memorial.

The '72 year old Pharmacy School
building, located on the Boulevard
of the Allies at'Pride Street, was
added to the University over two
years ago, on Jan. 26, 1948.

Formerly the school, complete
in one building, was the independent
College of Pharmacy.

Have Conveniences

Present day Pharmacy students’

have all the conveniences of the
Cathedral’s modern campus. The
men's and women's lounges,
equipped like miniature automats,
resemble the Tuck Shops. Machines
for coke, candy, ice cream and
canned fruit juice are all included.
Students can even play cards in
these lounges. V

Other rooms for leisure use in-
clude a study room and the third
floor library. This library, which
contains 80,000 volumes, has very
few books of general interest, most
of them being of a technical nature.

Educational life in Pharmacy
School centers around the lecture
hall, called '03 Hall because it
was donated by the class of 1903;
and the four recitation laboratories.

Four Complete Labs
These labs include the organic
chemistry lab; the qualitative and
quantitative lab; the pharmacy lab,

= used for Galenical, dispensing and

operative pharmacy; and the phar-
macology lab, which is also used
for pharmacognosy, M0108)’ and
physics experiments.

Two years ago when the Fred

in their extra curricular schedule.
At present, all third hour classes
are dismissed, and faculty and stu-
dents use this time as an activities
period, while Student Congress
has only recently conducted a poll
in the Cathedral to find out senti-
ment on a similar plan.

Unique in Field

Almost unique in the pharmacy
field is Dr. Stephen Wilson‘, vice-
dean of the school, whospecializes
In economics.

Considering the comparatively
short time the school of pharmacy
has been affiliated with Pitt, itghas
proved itself a real child prodigy.
With both studies and extracurricu-
lar life closely paralleling that in
the Cathedral, Pharmacy students
have become as much a part of Pitt
as the Oakland Skyscraper or the
ground floor Tuck Shops.

TB’ STAN KAPLAN

Len Casanova has made a long
trek from Redwood City to the smo-
key city. It's a long way from tiny
Sequoia High to the mighty Univer-
sity ofPittsburgh, but he made that
jump with none of the Devil’s wea-
pons.

He is the diametric opposite of
the caricatured cussing and hard-as-
nails football coach. He seldom, if
ever, cusses in the grand old style
of the Doc Carlson type coach.

He hasn't the dramatic appeal of
the Rockne type; his boys aren’t
subject to half-time tear-jerking
speeches. lleis not bombastic, and
does not shout and drive his players.

Dynamic wife

Casanova is complemented in
life by a wife who is as dynamic
as he is shy. Dixie Casanova talks
animatedly, enjoys people, and
loves a party. She will be a most
enthusiastic addition to the Uni-
versity cheering section.

The Casanova children are a
study of their parents.

School in Redwood, California, his
star halfback was Jack Roache.
Six weeks before the end of
Roache’.s senior year, his parents
moved to another state. Roache,
who was to enter Santa Clara the
next year, did not want to leave
California; so, Casanova took the
boy into his home, and he has lit-

When the coach moved to Sa-nta
Clara to assist Buck Shaw, Roache
went with him and became a star

that went to the Sugar bowl and
beat LSU, 6-0.

After the war, when Santa Clara

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. The
basketball loss to West Virginia
in the season's finale here Satur-

end” for Pitt sports teams.

Mountaineer _rooters finally saw
their “Beat the hell out of Pitt”
chant become a reality, as West

five sports events between the
two schools. I

Pitt teams are just getting over
their “hangover” caused by wrest-
ling, rifle, and freshmen and var-
sity basketball defeats. Only a
freshmen wrestling victory pre-
vented a complete blackout.

Hillbillies Get Happy _
As each score of the day in the
Mounties’ favor was announced to
the capacity field house crowd of
7,000 preceding the varsity hoop
contest, the hillbillies roared and
filled the auditorium with spirited
cheers.
Pitt’s

hoop loss brought its
record to four wins and

for the Panthers were Captain
George McCrossin and Lou “Bim-
bo” Cecconi, graduating seniors.
Ironically, Pitt's valiant attempt
to overtake the Mounties in the
second half was impeded by the
erratic passing of the usually re-
liable Cecconi. This, coupled with
the Mounties’ close guarding of
the high scoring McCrossin which.

stalled the Panthers’ belated rally.

Workman Nemesis Again
Pitt had come from 13 points
behind with two minutes remaining.»
to within four points ogwest Virgin-
ia, 57-53. There were still 54 sec-

missed otherechances to score. 

Six-foot-eight Mark Workman was
again the thorn in Pitt’s side. The
big hillbilly’s 24 points and height
under the boards whipped
visitors into submission.

Best performance -for the Pan-
thers was turned in by Bob Yurko,

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. - Pitt’s wrestlers, who trekked into the wild-
erness of West Virginia Saturday in a final effort to win their first vic-
tory in ten meets, will have to wait until next year to emerge from the’
wilderness ‘of losses. The Mounties edged the Panth'ers,*'14-12, in the
best and last Pitt performance of the season. ,

If Saturday's meet is any indication of mat events to come, Coach
Rex Peery’s matmen aren't long for the world of darkness and defeat.

   

The pill-roller administered some bitter medicine to
Murphy when he decisioned the West Virginian, 3-0.
Clark’s decision was one of four that the Panthers
won as they lost to the Mountaineers, 14-12.

Ml)RGANTOWN, W.Va. -- Coacih
Watts Shablowski’s Pitt riflemen
lost a shoulder-to-shoulder match
to West Virginia here Saturday,
1388-1366.

The Panthers’ top sharpshooter
was Newman Howard with a score
of 278. West Virginia’s high score
was 282.

This and the fact that Peery
has promising» freshmen in Dave
Davis, Hal Miller, Gayle Ellis,
John George, and Mike Pappas
points to a more successful sec-
ond year.

THE DU PONT

DIGEST

Science Makes a Better Mop

 

Cleaning tasks lightened by new

Du Pom cellulose sponge yarn

An ordinary mop has a bad habit of
unraveling. It often leaves a trail of
lint. And it wears out fast. A man
who sold yarn to mop manufacturers
decided to do something about these
nuisances. Perhaps some reinforcing
material might be combined with the
yarn. He did some experimental work
of his own but more and more he
wondered if it might be possible to
use a cellulose sponge coating.

THREE YEARS OF RESEARCH

So the man called on Du Pont, the
company that had introduced the
cellulose sponge to America in 1936.
The suggestion of a sponge yarn pre-
sented a challenging problem.

Some way would have to be found
to extrude a tightly ﬁtting cellulose
sponge jacket around eachfstrand of

 

Athe.yarn. The whole sponge process

would have to be adjusted for use
in an especially designed machine.
Du Pont chemists and engineers
tackled these problems.

Even the very ﬁrst cellulose sponge
yarn produced experimentally made
mops that were strong, absorbent
and durable. But the process had to
be changed and improved time and
time again. Then the mops were
tested in places where they would
get the hardest usage-—railroad sta-
tions, for example.

manufactured the yarn on a small
scale. Only after three years of study
and testing was Du Pont able to . .

I

  

cnoss.s:c1'|oN of the new mop _yarn. Each «
cotton ﬁber strand is jacketed with cellulose
sponge material.

' offer mop Nmanufacturers the yarn
in commercial quantities.

FASTER AND CLEANER

Mops made with cellulose sponge
yarn pick up and retain so much
water they need wringing less often. ,
You can mop a ﬂoor, with them in
far less time than it formerly took.
They dry quickly, leave no lint. They
outwear other mops three to ﬁve
times. Best of all, perhaps, they stay
dirt-free longer than ordinary mops. .
Here is something women will ap-
preciate———a clean mop!

The introduction of these new
cleaning tools is another example of
how business ﬁrms of all sizes depend
on each other. The Du Pont Com-
pany had facilities for specialized re-
search on cellulose sponge. Because
Du Pont could supply sponge yarn
economically, some twenty mop man-
ufacturers today have a better prod-
uct that saves maintenance people

and the American housewife time,

98, Delaware.

The mops performed so well that
Du Pont built a pilot plant near
Buffalo and, under a license from
the man who had the original idea,

labor and money.

Seekers to °Sell Yourself’

.3)’ LOIS FOIGHT
L Selling yourselfduring a job interview needs the same techniques you
use in selling any product. And a good first impression is one of the
most important, according to George A. Palmer, personal director at

Joseph Ilorne’s.

Mr. Palmer, who supervises em-
ployment, training, employees ser-
vices and labor relations at the
downtown department store, will
close this ‘week's 15 Vocational
Guidance Conferences for women
in a. talk Friday at 3:30 p.m. in
Stephen Foster Social Room.

Continuing, Mr.Palmer notes that
interviewees are judged on what
they look like, what they can do,
what they sayland how they say it.

Experience Not Essential

Although he agrees that most Col-
lege students now looking for part
time and summer employment have
little experience with which to sell
themselves, he warns against con-
fusing ability with experience, since
sincere interest, enthusiasm, and
native talent are of primary impor-
tance.

Mr. Palmer has outlined four im-
portant points to use in preparing
for an interview in his twelve years
of interviewing over 200,000 appli-
Cants.

sneak—thief’s eye.
And in all these rooms the dress-

drawers were without locks.
In one of the rooms where we
took pictures, the photographer
arranged the loot to suitihimself.
He had posed his picture and taken
it, before anyone bothered him.

The janitor interrupted him in

the room for ten minutes.

One of the residents I queried on
his seeming carelessness in leav-

Still NoOK
On Center

Complications have set into the
plans for a student center in Grace
Reformed Church.

The University has not yet ap-
proved the establishment of the
center proposed by the Student
Christian Federation. According to
Dick Campbell, chairman of the
SCF, University approval hinges
on two things: the setting up of a
workable system of supervision for
the center and a favorable opinion
of the suitability of the church fa-
cilities to be arrived at by the dean
of men and the dean of women after
a tour of inspection.

Supervision a Problem

The SCF, according toCampbell,
first approached the student pas-
tors on the question of supervision.
The pastors replied that they were
unable to assume full-time re spon-
sibility for the center. Therefore,
the Federation is now seeking the
aid of a group of women to supple-
ment the work of the pastors at
Grace Church.
~ However, even if they did not
receive the new plans for super-
vision, the dean of men and the
dean of women were to inspect the
center sometime this week.

Opening Doubtful

At present it is doubtful that the
center will open until at least a
week after March 13, which was the
tentative opening date.

Meanwhile renovation of the
wing of the Grace Church, in which
the center is to be located,is being
continued.After cleaning and paint-
ing is done, the center will still be
in need of furniture, says Campbell,
and the University will probably
be asked forhelpin that connection.
