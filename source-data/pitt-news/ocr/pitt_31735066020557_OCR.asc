. This is the story of ’Pitt’s oldest
existing student organization and

‘ how, after 90 years of history and

tradition, it came precariously close“

‘ to extinction.

The Pitt Men’s.G1ee Club was
founded in 1890 as the Banjo and

Mandolin Club. Overthe years, the .

club imbued itself with a rich" tradi-
tion while combining the centuries-
old male choral tradition of Europe
with American music forms such as
folk songs, spirituals, barbershop
style and football ﬁght songs. The
club developed a diverse repertoire
—— virtually everything from Bach to
bebop. - , '

But‘ it became more than a per-
forming group. It was a fraternity
with a rigid class structure complete
with upper-class hazing of freshmen
members thatculminated in an initi-
ation ceremony.

Initiation would take place during
a tour, which the ‘Glee Club for
decades made twice yearly in the
spring and‘ fall (they would tour

small, private w'omen’s colleges in an"

"effort to compensate for the lack of
female _membership). This was in

addition to the spring and fall con-_ , ,

certs, which for decades ‘were-per-
formed at Carnegie ,Music Hall,
usually accompanied by a’ small
orchestra. V '

. Membership would average
between 40 and 50 men. In 1974, the
group toured Mexico, and two years
later it toured Europe.

In the fall of 1982, the Pitt Men’s

Glee Club had one, solitary, lone
-’ returning member. * - ~

So what happened?

The year after ‘its successful 1976 ,

European tour, the club’s budget
was slashed by'90 percent in an aus-
terity move by the university. The
group went from annual budgets of
several thousand dollars to an
appropriation ofjust afew hundred.

The membership went from having as

per diem of $4 while on tour to hav-
ing to pay dues. —
Shortly after. that, the club was hit

_ by federal statute Title IX. Title IX

prohibits any -institution receiving
federal monies to engage in sex dis-
crimination. Being a recipient of fed-
eralmoney, the university told the

club‘ to delete the word “Men’s”
from its name and ordered it to join

’ ranks with. the Women’s Choralto

form a new group to be called The
Pitt Choral Ensemble. '
, The groupthen-had to move from

; its office in the student union to the

choral’s office. To the membership

. at that ‘time, this was an enormous

indignity. They would move from
their long-occupied office’, but they
refused to change a name they had
adopted ‘over 70 years previously
(the Woman's Choral did change its
name and is now known as the Pitt
Choral Ensemble). The club’s stub-
bornness only intensiﬁed the mount-
ing tensions among them, the
student government and the music
department. I

In a further austerity move, the

money appropriated for the club’s
director was eliminated. The group
went from having a highly talented
director with a Ph.D. in choral tech-
nique to performing under inexpe-
rienced graduate students from the

V music department; .-

Without money, the Glee Club
could no longer afford to tour.
Without the glamour and excite-

ment of touring, much of the allure .

On the road   

Voter group - .

stresses

By‘ Dave Hooker
The Pitt News

A bus painted red, white. and blue
with the slogan “You can make a
difference -—- vote on issues”on both
sides parked in front of the Towers
on Forbes avenue between 12:30 and
1 p.m. yesterday.

The bus is owned by the Pennsyl-

vania chapter of a group called The‘

Difference in ’84. The group is a
nonpartisan organization commit-
ted, according to-its coordinator
Gene Stilp, “to. make people think
about issues ,— local, state and
federal." - '

The Pennsylvania Difference in
'84 group has been on the road try-

ing to stir up debate and discussion

on the issues and elections "for six
weeks. During this time, they have
logged over 7,000 miles all of which,
except for a trip to the presidential
debate in Louisville, have been trav-
eled in Pennsylvania.

According to Sti1p,'many of the
stopsthey have madehave been on
college campuses, which he says
tend to be very conservative. The

   Pitt   G1eeClubbrought backto life  

of belonging to the group was lost
and membership began to decline.
Without qualified leadership, the‘
musicality of the club withered."
Without the ability to create good
music, the Pitt Men’s Glee Club col-

lapsed like a house of playing cards. '

‘Four years after the European
tour, the Glee Club was struggling to
stay above 15- in« number, and by

.1982, only one member signed on.

So what happened then?

The group was fortunate to get
John Yankee as its director.

Yankee,‘ a doctoral student in
music composition, said it was sheer
luck that he happened to get the
position. i

“I decided at the last minute to
study at Pitt. The Glee Club was the
only TA [teaching assistant] posi-
tion left.”

Having studied for his master’s
degree at Yale, Yankee was familiar
with traditional glee" club singing.
The Yale»G1ee Club is the standard
to which a glee club. aspires. _

“I did a lot of work," said Yankee,
“to make the group a viable music
organization again.” ‘

Yankee and the lone member re-
cruited two‘ others from the Heinz

issues in

students at Penn State, he said, are

“brain dead. They don't think. One 

student said that he couldn't registe
to vote because he had to g
raquetball class.”

Stilp said he feels as if his group is‘ _.
accomplishing something, having~.l'A“,";
registered-2,000 people to vote. Only 
52_percent of registered voters actu- 

ally voted in 1980.

“Students have a_ big stake in this

election,“ he said, “and it’s impor-

tant that they know the candidates

before voting.“ ,
Stilp continued, “I wonder ho

many students can get through all _i:.

the rhetoric. lt’s a challenge to find
out about the issues.”

Although the Difference in '84 has
groups in many states, no other

group goes about their business on - :

the road. Stilp explained the reason‘
for the bus: “We want to spark peo-
ple with something that’s different,

colorful. Wejust went about it [edu_- 

cating voters] differently.”

The Difference in '84 bus willcon-_ 
tinue its mission until Election Day, .

Nov. 6.

Chapel Choir and club alumnus. ’—i;..-.‘
The five formed the nucleus of the'_ V,‘

rebirth.

In an effort to gain exposure and
recruit, “We worked hard,” said 
Yankee, “and sang everywhere we};

could ...'” .

The hard work slowly paid'off.~By 
the end of that year, there were .11}? ';
members performing a spring con- 
cert. By the end of the next year, the"?

number had risen to 18. .

Today, there are 24 members of 
the Pitt Men’s Glee Club. They are_ 

busy preparing for a fall concert

(Nov. 11, 4 p.m. at Heinz’Chapel) 
and are planning their first _tour in 
six years for the spring. ' .‘

.‘‘We’re working our way up the

musical ladder, so to speak,”isaid Ed‘; if
Helgerman, the current presiucm or 

the Glee Club.

“We can be bigger, but it’s a nice 
size,” said Yankee, “and we’re de_ve1-_ 

oping exposure." ‘

Hoping to maintain this momen- 3."
tum, the Glee Club is looking for-
ward to 1990 when it will celebrate-
its centennial. But the same pr/ob-ff.-._
lems that dragged the club d0Wﬂ:,~’;
before may resurface after _Yankeej”-.

I The Pitt News

Governor Thornburgh signed a
bill last week that appropriated $2.5
million.to Pitt’s Falk Clinic for ﬁscal
year I984-85 in an effo_rt to help curb
the clinic’s increasing deficit.

Q

The deficit seriously jeopardizes
the effective continuation of the
clinic, according to Senator D.
Michael Fisher (R-Allegheny
County), who introduced the
legislation.

- Falk clinic is an out-patient facil-
ity that provides medical services to
at least 120,000 low-income resi-
dents a year whoiare unemployed,"
have no medical insurance or are
ineligible. for medical assistance. I’
Since 1931, the clinic has provided
care for all patients regardless of
their ability to pay, " Fisher
explained, but “recession inthe area

I  The Pitt ‘N¢i;s..wcdncsaa9.ember 24, i984

-.   . Clinic to get $2.5 million

has put a burden on the clinic that
threatens co_ntinued operation.”

Fisher pointed out that although
reimbursement for Medicaid is $15
per visit to the clinic actual cost is
$33 to the clinic, thus resulting in the
-current annual deficit of around $1.4
million.

Fisher seemed satisfied with the
appropriation. ‘fl am truly pleased
that the governor signed this appro-
priation,” he said. “It assures’ the
continuation of what, for thousands
of persons throughout the Alleghe-
ny county area, is a vital source of
medical care."

Falk Clinic Administrator Jeffrey
Romoff was also happy that the
commonwealth and legislatures had
supported the clinic. He said that it
was “wonderful, good news” to hear
about the appropriation.

“The clinic traditionally has
financial difficulties,” Romoff
explained. Although the -actual

deficit is difficult to estimate, many
millions of dollars have been spent
in the past at the clinic to provide
services, he said.

According to Romoff, Falk Clinic
has many present and future needs,
but the appropriation “will meet
many needs that not having $2.5 mil-
lion would not meet.” First, how-
ever, they must explore whether
there are any administrative restric-
tions as to what the money could be
used for, he added.

Fisher expressed his concern for A

the clinic’s survival.“I dread to think
of what might happen if Falk Clinic

was ever forced to close or even cur- .

tail its services,” he said.

Romoff wasn’t worried. “I am
very confident that it [the clinic] will

survive. ”

Cheap Apples  

Computer discount offered

By Dan Taylor
The Pitt News

If you’ve been waiting to join the
ranks of the personal computer
crowd but just can‘t afford it, Pitt’s

new discount arrangement might be I

for you. The arrangement, made
with Apple Computer, Inc. and
Mace Computer Center, enables
faculty, staff and full-time students
to buy Apple and 'l.B.M. personal
computers and accessories at 25 to
35 percent off list price. These com-
puters can be hooked up to the uni-
versity computer center, also.

The deal on l.B.M. products was
struck solely with Mace, centered in

Erie, Pa. The discount on Apple
computers was made possible by a
nationwide movement of the Apple
Computer company known as the
Apple University Consortium. ‘

As a “second wave” university,
Pitt was not among the schools orig-
ipally chosen by Apple to take part
in the program and, consequently,
doesn’t get quite the discount those
schools do. Associate Senior Vice
President David Forejt, the man
who negotiated the arrangement,
explained that after being passed
over for the first wave, “we sought
them” the second time around.

Students at Carnegie-Mellon Uni-
versity have had personal computers
available at a discount rate for some

time now. C.M.U. is recognized as a
leader with regard to the use of the
personal computer as a _learning
tool, and’ as such was invited by
Apple to join the first wave of the

consortium. Students at C.M.U.,

shop for computers at their own,
newly constructed computer store.
According to Vice President
Forejt, Pitt will not make personal
computers mandatory in the fore-
seeable future but wanted to make
them available to students who wish
to use them. '

With the increasing importance of "

the computer in education, this
arrangement comes none too soon.
It puts the personal computer within
the reach of the Pitt students. .

Rockin’ campaign?
Candidate makes video  

(USPS) — TV commercials have
long been a politician’s most impor-
tant way to reach the voting public.
But one candidate is taking the pro-
cess one step further. Governor
Robert Orr of Indiana has produced
America’s first political rock video.

' The two-minute “Governor Orr
Music, Video" began airing on both
MTV and commercial television on
Friday, Oct. 5, I984. The title song
from recording artist Henry Lee
Summer’s new album, “Stay With
Me,” is the music soundtrack for the
video. The video revolves around a
fortune-telling theme and features
both Governor Orr and Summer.

Governor Orr commented on the
.video at an Indianapolis press con-
ference last week. “This video is a

unique effort to reach young voters
with our central message —— that the

real issue of this campaign is lndia- /

na’s future, and that the Orr-Mutz
team is the most qualified, most
experienced and best prepared to
lead Indiana into that future.”

The governor based his strategy
on statistics from a recent Market
Opinion Research poll of younger
voters. The poll, commissioned by
the Orr-Mutz campaign, found the
18- to 24-year-old age group com-
prises 12 percent of the electorate. In

‘that age group, 41 percent are

Republicans and 39 percent are

independents. Only 20 percent are .
Democrats. Of the independents, 56’

percent are more likely to vote
Republican. Approximately 40 per-

“checkout our: mm-:o CLUB!”

cent of the 18-24 age group votes on
election day.

“We know from our polling that
young voters are more likely to vote
for us and for Republicans gener-
ally,” Orr said. “We aren’t going to
take that support for granted. We
are going to aggressively seek their
support and deliver on those issues
which are most important to them
— economic growth, education and
environmental protection?’

The video was directed by
Andrew Rippy and created and pro-
duced by John Hammond III and
Donna Hammond.

Now that Sunday’s debate is three days behind us and the

I very few upset specks of dust have settled, one is left with a few
‘ nagging questions. The first —— most obvious — question con-

cerns something that was virtually ignored by each candidate in
its entirety; a subject that, to many minds, is of significant
relevance to any confrontation between candidates and, ulti- -

‘ mately, to the election: the issues. The president did not at any

gr” time during Sunday’s debate address an issue in more than the

, ' most vague and peripheral way. Not only did Walter ‘Mondale

 not seem.to find this troubling, he did the same thing.

‘ When asked what he thought to be the fundamental and
underpinning principles explaining the nature of the presid-
ency, and the extension of his perceived role therein, -Mondale

I replied by demanding that Vice President George Bush apolog-

: ‘ ize forrnisrepresenting a statementof Mondale’s. When asked

l what he planned to do about the escalation of nuclear arms

 over the next four years, the president whined about Mondale’s
repetition of his statement that submarine-launched missiles

can be recalled. This theme — the demand for contrition — was
the overriding theme of the whole debate. - _
Furthermore, at no time during the debate did Mondale

V explain‘ in any rational, logical’ orclear way his qualificatioins
for the job of Chief Executive of the United States of America;

' instead, he explained why Ronald Reagan is not qualified (or
even competent) to hold his present position. Mondale did’ not
state his position on Central America, he only criticized the, _
president’s. He did not outline a plan for the future of the U.S.

’ economy, he only criticized the president’s. And so it went the

VFW-same way~with,i_ssues of__m_ilitary spending, the now tiresome

2 “age issue” and what to do about rising deficits." -

 ‘ *-s‘As_laclEing' as ’Mondale’s performance was, however, Rea-

. gan’s was even more shallow and less self-supporting. R_eagan’s

 _ statements relating to Central America and the Middle East .
were in no way able to be interpreted as explanations of a policy’
that he can define as sound. Nor were they plans for change or
continuation of such policies as they stand. Instead,ihis state-
ments tended toward an emotional defense of sacred actions

that ought not to be challenged by any moral human being.

The second nagging question, which a rises from the above

w facts, concerns the reasons for such smoke screening. Do the

After reading Steve- Morrison’s
“Lukewarm Socialism” article in
The Pitt News, (Oct. 19, 1984), I too_
feel the urge to write. Can it be possi-
ble that WPTS suffers from a dis- -
ease? Perhaps only the ignorant
listeners who criticize what WPTS is
doing suffer from this disease. '
_Chris Kramer’s defense-a_nd sup- _
port of WPTS isabsolutelyjusti/ﬂed. _.
We, the students of the University of
Pittsburgh, want W PTS to continue
the programming format that they
have been using. Non-stop requests
is not a stupid theory, but in essence
gives the student‘ body the freedom
to choose the music that it wants to
hear. Need we ask for more? Who
cares if the same song is heard two or
C, three times within ’ a two-hour
,..pe_i-iod? Because the music does not
suit yourtastes, why donft you just
turn it off and let those of us who
want to listen to it listen?
Why do you also find the need to
criticize the WPTS disc jockeys?
- They definitely are students and
function off of our input. They cer-
tainly cannot be judged on the basis
of the music they play, as it is our
requests whichdictate what is or is
not played. These students whom
you refer to as “go-getters” function
to please the listeners, and that is
their first priority. If you do not like
what they are playing, why don't you
call the station and tell them? WPTS '
responds to the requests of the stu-
dents and always listens to reasona-
ble input from listeners. ~
The number of students that
attend Pitt is no unknown fact.
Those students who take the time to
spend a few extra seconds out of
their lives to call up our radio station
get to listen to what they want to ‘
hear. Those of you who just sit and
vegetate are the ones who are com-
plaining about what is or is not
played on the radio. Why don't you
call WPTS at 624-5930 and talk with
the disc jockeys? They are people
just like you and me, with the same
intelligence. How can a student-run
radio station play the requests of the
whole student body if some of you
know-it-al_ls don’t tell them what
you prefer? if you don't have the
guts to call the station, then simply
write them a letter. You seem to
know how to do that at least.
College radio is one of the last
methods of public expression for
freedom in music. Freedom, how-
ever, is based on democracy, and
therefore the input and free choice of
those who believe in it is needed.
Each member is free to do as he
chooses.‘ Those of ‘us whobelieve in '

’ slanderous- remarks made about Pi
Kappa Alpha fraternityin The Pitt
News (Oct. 22, 1984). First of all, I -
think the university has made a big
mistake by putting the ‘fraternities
-‘ up on the hill. I"don't think they
examined what the long-running
effects of that move would be. SAE
and Pika have never gotten along
too well. . The other houses have ,
some ill feelings for each other too.
What does a little singing matter? So I
someone sang to you at night? It’s
only words. It doesn’t hurt, unless
you know it’s true. And this bit
about breaking into houses and
stealing things has got to go. We, the
fraternities on the ‘hill, are supposed
to set an example for the rest of the
students. .

What it really comes down to is
this: We're all going to be there for a
long time, so let's act like human
beings and keep the rivalry on the
sports field where it belongs.

How much “artistic license” is a
presidential candidate allowed to
take when trying to appeal to his
audience, especially when a candi-
date is an incumbent, as is Ronald
Reagan? Events like Sunday night’s
presidential debate on foreign policy
will naturally focus on that presi-
dent’s record for the four years of his
term. In a democratic election pro-
cess, the media has a responsibility
to bring the facts concerning the
strong points and shortcomings of a
candidate’s record to the public eye
and to make the facts obvious to the
voting public so they can make an
intelligent choice as to who will lead
their nation for the following four-
yearrterm.

We all know that President Rea-
gan’s forte has always been his show-
manship, and a candidate’s ability
for showmanship despite a lack. of
knowledge of the ins and outs of his
own administration can be, unfortu-
nately, a legitimate inﬂuence on
voters in the democratic process.
Likewise, Walter Mondale’s com-
parative inability to be a showman
despite his knowledge and expe-
rience can also be a legitimate reason

in a free-election for failing to attract _

the interest of the voters. What is
unacceptable and not legitimate,
however, is how far this--newly-
established “showman approach”

The Pitt News, Wednesday, October 24, 1984 L
From Under the Desk/ by Vincent Murphy
Reagan: License to Lie?

has gone with Reagan in this year’s
campaign, and especially in Sunday
night's foreign policy debate.

The polls show that Reagan was
much more “on his toes” for this
debate than he was in his domestic
policy debate~two weeks ago, and
people responded to that. There

SCCITIS IO b6 3 COIISCIISUS among '

major newspapers that the Ameri-
can public sees the most recent
debate as a “draw.” Reagan had
snappy answers to many of the

corners that his opponent backed .

him into and, in a publicly judged
debate, snappylanswers mean vic-
tory. For most American voters, the
debate was the single most decisive
factor in their choice for Nov. 6th.

Reagan effectively delivered
answers of sometimes extremely
misinformed or even false content,
knowing that there would be little
repercussion for his showmanship
approach. In other words, he knew
that not even a fraction of the televi-
sion viewing audience would pick up
a New York Times or a Washington
Post the next day to see the astound-
ing rebuttals to the content of his

answers, which were referred to by —

the American CIA, Phillipine offi-
cials and other involved groups as,
plain and simply, “not true.”

‘ The controversy over manuals
distributed by the CIA in Nicaragua

which instructed citizens how to use
guerilla tactics to effectively assassi-
nate members of the Sandinista
regime was a major criticism against
Reagan in Sunday’s debate. Reagan
responded that he felt the matter had
been sensationalized and that all
material in violation of U.S. policy
was deleted in an editing process.
“But some way or another there
were 12 of the original copies that
got down there,” he said. The fol-
lowing day, the front page of the
New York Times featured an article
that read: “Central Intelligence
Agency officialstold two senators
today that no copies of the CIA
manual on guerilla warfare were
edited...” And further on in the same
article was the statement that,
“White House officials said the pres-
ident had misspoken." Misspoken?
How about “the president had fabri-
cated the story?"

Reagan also defended the U.S.
backing of the Marcos government
in the Phillipines by stating that “the
alternative is a large communist
movement to take over the Philli-
pines." On the third page of the New
York Times on Oct. 23 we find a
statement that he had badly “mis-
read the situation,” and later, “a

state department spokesman said.

that Mr. Reagan had not meant to
suggest that communism was the

only alternative to Marcos."

These are only a few examples of
Reagan’s use of his “poetic license.”
Sunday night’s debate also con-
tained a well-known denial by Rea-
gan that he had never commented
that submarine-based missiles could
be recalled after being launched. ‘‘I
never said any such thing," he said.
Taking a very rare stand, NBCjour-
nalists cleared this up immediately
after the debate had finished, read-
ing the statement taken from a I982
press conference.

The point is that this cool “show-
manship” which is the very base of
the Reagan campaign is being used
as an excuse to dodge any dilemma
that the president -faces with a
haphazard blunder or an outright
falsehood.

Cleaning women tell  “untoldstory”  

By Mike Nicol
The Pitt News

Faster than dirt builds up! More

powerful than a Hoover vacuum!
Able to dust tall bookshelves in a
single bound! They’re*employees of
the university dorms — more affec-
tionately known as “cleaning
ladies.” Whether you've seen them at
work or not, you've been directly
affected by the work they've done.
The bathrooms are cleaned thor-
oughly .each day, as well as the
lounge areas in the Towers, while
individual rooms are scoured once a
month. -

‘ Along with the 8:30 to 4:30, five-
days-a-week upkeep of the dorms
come quite a few surprises. A few of
the Towers’ cleaning ladies, who
chose to remain anonymous,
revealed some of their more unique
experiences here at Pitt.

According to one cleaning lady,
some students a few years back

' thought it would be cute to scare her

by letting whitemice loose in their
room before she cleaned it. How-
ever, she said that it didn’t scare her
because '“I’m quite used to that sort

of thing after ten years here. Stu-V

dents would even have birds flying
around their rooms before I came in,

«and I’d have to sweeprfeathers up

 

from all over the room."

According to the same cleaning
lady, some girls in Tower C even
managed to keep a snake (appar-
ently non-venomous) in their room.
Although these stories are common,
pets are not permitted in the dorms.

Another
Tower B related atale concerning a
student who was rettrrning tohis
room after a shower: “His room-
mate suddenly took his towel from
him and locked him out of the
room,” said the cleaning lady. “After
watching him run around the floor
trying to find a towel for a while, I
finally gave him a towel from the
storage room.” ‘

cleaning lady from.

Some of the things that are con-
sidered normal by college students
often appear very abnormal to a
cleaning lady. For instance, a third
cleaning lady said she had seen stu-
dents breakdancing with only towels
on, and girls treating Cabbage Patch
dolls like human ‘beings seemed
strange to a fourth. .

Many unusual incidents have
made their way into these ladies’
lives. Perhaps the strangest of all
was told by another Tower B clean-
ing lady.

She happened to be in a male‘s
room doing herjob while he was on
the telephone with his girlfriend. “As
I was leaving his room,” said the

cleaning lady, “he said goodbye to 
me, but his girlfriend would not 
believe that he was saying goodbye
to his maid. She insisted that he was ; 
cheating on her. I had to get on the. 7?;
phone and tell her my age, then talk 
for a while to get her to believe it." 
Eventually the girlfriend realized the! ‘if
truth, and invited the cleaning lady 
to a “happy hour“ with them. The 

lady refused the invitation.

For enduring these sorts of she-‘ 
nanigans, maybe the ‘cleaning ladies 27',
do deserve to be referred to as 
“superwomen." To be sure, as lon’g_e, ‘
as there are college students around, :*._3
their experiences can only become *2"

more unusual.

 “The biggest problem is that most

that affect the club] know nothing

Yankee said that the advising cen-

inform registering students that the
group does exist. Any student inter-
ested in singing may receive one
credit every other term by singing
with the group.

But perhaps the Pitt Men’s Glee
Club's greatest untapped resource is
its many loyal alumni. In the recent
student union renovation, many of
the club's records were lost, so an
appeal was made in the Alumni
Times for any club alumni to get in
touch. The response was
tremendous. ' .

'“People don’t know what they’re
missing until they hear us,” said
Yankee. “They’ll be surprised.”

The Famous Rider Cultural Cen-
ter in Oakland has announced its
1984-85 season. This year the ‘Fa-
mous Rider will present three
contemporary classics as well as a
series of workshops for the actor and
photographer. The Famous Rider
season, with the theme of “A Classic
Alternative,” will once again be co-
produced by “We’re Entertain-
ment.”

The first offering of the season is

“Slueth” by Anthony Shaffer. This

play which won the Mystery Writers
of America award in 1970 will run
from Oct. 26 through Nov. 17. “Of
Mice and Men" by John Steinbeck is
the second selection. The play is
taken ‘directly from the award. win-
ning novel and is truly a masterpiece
of the stage. “Of Mice and Men”
runs from Feb. 8 through March 2.

I The final selection will be John

Osborne's “The Entertainer.” This
moving, serio~comical piece is an
allegory of the demise of" the old
burlesque houses. “The Entertainer”
runs from April 19 through May 11.

The Fall Workshop series begins

A Nov. 3. The first Workshop to be

offered is “For the Actor.” Actor,
director and designer John Don-
nelly -will teach techniques for

improving awareness and improving
skills in observation, recall concen-
tration and expression. Bill Ram-Z

theatre season please call 681-1476.

At present there are 14,000 to
17,000 Jews struggling to survive in
the northwestern Ethiopian moun-
tains and in Sudanese refugee
camps. These Ethiopian Jews, who
claim to, be descendents of King
Solomon and the Queen of Sheba,
are surrounded by many legends.
Some suggest that they were left
behind when Moses brought the
children of Israel across the Red
Sea, while others believe that they
are the lost tribe of Dan. Most
importantly, these Ethiopian Jews
have been practicing Judaism for
2,500 years, isolated from the rest of
world Jewry, and are now facing the
threat of extinction.

This month’s “From the Four
Corners” World Jewry forum for
Social Action and Awareness, spon-
sored by the Jewish University Cen-

The Pitt News, Wednesday, 'October.24, "1984-‘~

 

 

Bertrand Russell smiles down from his perch high above a neat
desk. A life-size, lifelike Albert Einstein strides out of the opposite
ofﬁcewall, happily intent on getting from one end of the campus to
another. The late great professor grins sheepishly from under a purple
baseball cap emblazoned with the name of another academic giant.
Freud. '

According to pop psychologists, office decor strongly reﬁects the
interests and character of the occupant. With such a superﬁcial exami-
nation, it is doubtful that the less visible “P factor" would be consi-
dered in developing a proﬁle of Pitt professor Adolf Grunbaum: that
is P for philosophy (B.A. Wesleyan University, 1943; Ph.D., Yale
University. 1951), physics (M.S., Yale, 1948) and psychiatry (secon-
dary appointment, Pitt, I979). '

P does not appear to be an over-used letter in Adolf Grunbaum’s
vocabulary. To the contrary, the ofﬁce, with its quiet furnishings, neat
desk and bookshelves, speaks of a man more concerned with intellec-
tual pursuits than creature or ego comforts. The only sign of that
capital P, Academic Privilege, is an ancient and cranky Whirlpool air
condt'tioner.~ _ _

Grunbaum was born on May 15, 1923, in Cologne, West Germany,

‘ and ﬂed Nazi Germany with his family in 1938. According to Dr. «

Robert S. C ohen, Grunbaum ‘s long-time friend and editor of a collec-
tion of essays honoring the professors 60th birthday, this immigrant
family, uprooted from its native land, was unable to send Grunbaum
to college. Through scholarships and personal effort, Grunbaum was
able to enroll in Wesleyan University in the foothills of Connecticut.

Grunbaum completed his doctoral studies at Yale in nearby New
Haven in 195 I and joined the philsophy department of Lehigh Univer-

sity, where he remained until 1960. Grunbaum was made William’

Wilson Selfridge Professor of Philosophy at Lehigh at age 33 and was
a visiting research professor at the University of Minnesota during
1956 and 1959. . ,

He began his career at Pitt in 1960 as the Andrew Mellon Professor
of Philosophy. He was the director of the Center for Philosophy of
Science at Pitt from I 960 to 1978 and now serves as chairman of the
center. He was appointed research professor of psychiatry in 1979.

Grunbaumis ﬁrst academic paper was published in the Yale Law
Journal in 1948, and since then he has produced over 130 scholarly
articles and ﬁve books. His most recent volume, ". The Foundations of
Psychoanalysis: A Philosophical Critique, " was released this year to
resounding critical acclaim.

Grunbaum recently took time out from his hectic schedule to meet
with The Pitt News and discuss his lt'fe and career both in and outside
of Oakland.

Q: I noticed that you have degrees or interests in a lot of different
areas: mathematics, philosophy, physics. How did you come to com-
bine these different interests?

A: When I started out, I knew that I was interested in what is called
the philosophy of science. I think the philosophy of science without
the firsthand knowledge of science tends to be very shallow. So, from
the beginning, I wanted to study some of the sciences in which I had a
philosophical interest. Mathematicalphysics was the crucial one. It's
not that I didn't like mathematics and physics for their/own sake -
which I did — but they were all part of my main thrust, which was to
prepare myself for technical work in the philosophy of science. As an
undergraduate‘, what I did was to have a double major in mathematics

and philosophy, and then I took my masters degree in'7theoretical '

physics at Yale while also part-time already working for a Ph.D. in
philosophy. _

Q: You were working on two degrees at the same time?

A: That’s what I liked at Yale. Duringthe first two years, I took half
my courses in the physics department, half in the philosophy depart-
ment; then I picked up my master's degree in physics enroute. Very few
universities, if any universities, in this country had an arrangement
where by each of the two concerned departments made an allowance
for the fact that you were also working part-time in the other.

Q: While you were at Yale, were there any particular professors the
layman might know of that inﬂuenced your work?

A: One very notable onehwho is a world figure in the philosophy of
science was my teacher Carl G. Hempel, who, I am proud to say, has
been in our department during the last decade. He was a magnificent
and beloved teacher of mine.

I

Q: Were any of your interests fostered by your family? Were your

. parents involved with mathematics. physics or philosophy?

A: No, I don't quite know how I got interested in it. I was interested

' in it from boyhood on. I tried to read in it when I wasa kid; how much

of itl understood, how much of what I read I understood, I'm not sure
of.

Q: As your resume notes, there was a ﬁve- year period between the
time you earned your bachelor's and your master’s. What were you
doing then? ’

A: I was in the United States Army in the Military Intelligence
Service. I was in Europe in general and then in Germany, and after the
Nazi surrender, I was busy interrogating prominent Germans who had
been prominent in some way or other in the Nazi period for the U.S.
Intelligence Service. In fact, earlier today; a man from Berlin was here
to ask me about some things Iremember from that period because he
happens to be writing a book on that —- on the Nazi distortion of
scientific activity. ‘ I

Q: Were you involved in the Nuremburg Trials? .
A: No, not with the political side; it was with the scientific side.

Q: How did you end up in military intelligence? —

A: I am a native speaker of German, and when I went through the
regular army infantry training, I guess they gathered from my back-
ground that I might be suitable for that, and so I went to a training
school, as did a lot of people. with a similar background. It so
happened that Sigmund Freud’s' nephew was in the outfit — you
know, people who had a native command of German and who were
otherwise deemed trainable for that sort of work, interrogation of
prisoners of war. I

Q: Did you enlist, or were you drafted? ' . _

A: The‘ draft was on,_ but I enlisted anyway. I first worked brieﬂy in
the radiation laboratory of the Columbia University division of war
research, and then I went into the army and had the regular full
infantry training. Then -I ‘was sent for intelligence training and then
went overseas. I was with the advance party of the American army that
went into Berlin just before the bulk of our troops came in.

Q: When you were working in the radiation lab, was that in any way
related to the Manhattan Project? , ‘~
' A: No, that was just electronics. It was justradar electronics; it was
mostly just vacuum tube work. I was still pretty —— what shall I say —

' immature youngster. After ‘all, I'hadn’t,had graduate training yet. I

learned a lot, of course.

Q: How did you come to the University of Pittsburgh? Why did you
choose Pitt? - '

A: Because of then Vice Chancellor Charles H. Peake, who was an
extremely exciting administrator and recruiter. He told me that we
could build a first-class philosophy department here; that is, that there
would be support for buildinga first-class philosophy department
here. He was a marvelously persuasive recruiter and madeit very
exciting, and it turned out to be very exciting. He said that if I could
attract gifted people, the university would support their appointment.
So I set outto do just that when I came here. It has certainly worked
out. "

Q: Were you the ﬁfst member ofthe philosophy department, or did
you join an existing department? I .

A; There was an existing department. But none of the people from
that department save one remained at the university for any great
length of time. I have been here since 1960, so I am the most senior —
not the oldest in ‘age but the earliest appointee of the current
department. ' .

Q: .Why have you chosen to. remain at Pitt? I'm sure you have

. received offers from philosophy departments around the world.

A: Yes, I did. In__fact, I was offered a full professorship at Yale,
where I got my Ph.D., soon afterwards. It is a tremendously exciting
thing to be able to build a first-class department here of people who
were very congenial and where one felt thatione could make a major
contribution to a very exciting development. The university at that
time, the early ’60s, was in a tremendously expanding state both
actually and psychologically. It was an enormously challenging and
constructive adventure. ' - '

Q: Do you have any experience in clinical psychiatry? In treating

A: No, I don’t do empirical work. I keep abreast of a lot of the

Recently, several books and articles appeared concerning the Sig-

daughter, and Dr. Kurt Eissler. The most damaging shot was ﬁred by
Jeffrey, Masson, the scholar retained by the archive administrators.
Masson charged that Sigmund Freud repressed his true opinions
concerning the long-term effects of childhood sexual abuse for career
and professional reasons and then penned a book attempting to setthe

. psychoanalytic record straight. His efforts were met with stiff opposi-

tion from the Freudian community. Dr. Grunbaum ‘s most. recent

lCt6d by Lisa B. Keer

Q: I wanted to ask you about the problems surrounding the Freud
archives. What role- did you play in the shake-up that occured there?

A: Fortunately none, merely as an observer, a bystander. Janet
Malcolm wrote about the whole “scandal” in The New Yorker in reply
to the efforts by Jeffrey Masson and Peter Swales. The interesting
thing is that most of this has to do with the politics of psychoanalysis.
It may have something to do with F reud’s personal integrity. In so far
as his personal integrity has something to do with the credibility of
what he reported in his writing, it has an indirect bearing on that also.

Let's be very concrete about Jeffrey Masson. His claim is that Freud
knew at one time that all neuroses are due to childhood sexual abuse.
First of . all, this was never established either by Freud or by Masson.
He has no hard evidence for this because the kind of thing he thinks is
evidence is, in fact, not evidence. He doesn't have a case. He is so
naive, he believes all neuroses, which are very diverse in form, are due
to sexual child abuse. Well, if life were so simple that all disorders had
a single cause, we would ha/v,e a much easier time than we do. The only
reason it got so much publicity is because it involved scandal. And,
what one is discovering now, unfortunately, is that there is a good deal
of sexual abuse of children. . . ' \

It's‘ one thing to say someone had a painful experience. It's quite

another thing to prove that that painful experience in addition to

leaving a'painful memory also causes a disorder. Those are quite

different things. Not every painful experience causes people to be
dysfunctional in later life. If that were so, all of us would be raving

luriatics because we have all been through, in varying degrees, of
course-, painful experiences in childhood — disappointments, humili-
ations. Everybody goes through things of that sort,_you see. .
The difficulty with Masson is he assumed that Freud had originally
been right, that childhood seduction was the cause of hysterical neuro-
sis, and that then Freud thought it was not politically desirable to put

forward and so he gave it up for reasons of careerism and personal and
professional ambition, not becauseof a real conviction of change in

view.
Then what Masson goes on to say is therefore analysts since then.

only beginning to go into press. That is a book called “Validation of
Clinical Psychoanalysis: Disputations and Appreciations.” It will
come out in 1985.

Q: I consider what you doto be creative. As a creative individual how
do you create? ‘How do you go about getting the inspiration for these
works and putting them down? What is this process?

A: I wish-I knew. There are hundreds of thousands of people who
create a work of one sort or another. The psychology of creativity is
actually a branch of study. They themselves,[the creators] may not
know how they do such things. I have no special information other
than just superficial impressions of how I go about doing what I do.
I’m puzzled about a lot of things, and then I try to think my way
through them.

Q: There has always been this "publish or perish ”myth surround-
ing academic institutions. As a member of one of the top three
philosophy departments in the country, have you ever felt there is
pressure on you to do more research or publishing than there is
teaching?

A: As far as writing; is concerned, any pressure that I have felt to
write has been entirely internally generated. I have never tried to write
anything because I needed to do it in order to get promoted.I wouldn‘t
have gone into academic work if I didn't have the desire to think things
through and then_ to write them up. I have never felt any external
pressure to write anything. In fact, I think it's unfortunate that there is
such pressure on people who really don't feel like doing it or don’t have
anything on their mind that they really want to say. I do not believe it's
a good idea to put pressure on people to publish when they are just
going to fill the journals with busy work.

Q: Have you seen a lot of changes in undergraduates over the last 24
years? l_f so, what are the changes?

A: I would say that when we became state-related, the quality of
students improved. In the old days when tuition was not low, there
were an awful lot of students who went to Pitt who were not interested
in anything and went because their parents could afford it and because
it was fashionable to have a degree. After Pitt became state-related
and a lot ofstudents were able to afford to go, in my own opinion, I felt

_ that there was a definite improvement in the interest and motivation of

the students. Which is not to say that the motivation is as strong as I
would like it to be. Becoming state-related was a significant factor in
improving undergraduate quality and attitudes.

 

think that when women talk about sexual experiences as children with
male members of the family that these are only fantasies and not true.
All of this is speculation. There is no proof that that [childhood abuse]
caused adult neuroses. It may have, but Masson doesn’t know that to
be true and .pf course assumes it to be true. He charged Freud with
intellectual dishonesty. Given that it involved sex and scandal, this
became a natural for a big publicity stunt. Masson claims that a-failure
of nerve rather than contrary evidence prompted Freud‘s disavowal
[of the childhood seduction theory].‘ . ~

Q: Has the dispute been resolved?
A: I don’t really know.

Q: I'd like to change the subject. What are you working on now?

A: I have another book coming out that I have ﬁnished but which is

iWin holds significance

for Ziener, Rupp

.By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

A ten-day break is in store for the .

Pitt women's volleyball team, which
defeated Ohio University last night
at North Allegheny High School 15-
8,’ 15-_lO, 15-8. The match held spe-
cial significance for freshman Krista
Ziener, an NAHS alumna, and
senior Cathy Rupp, who transferred
from Ohio U.

“I was a little nervous playing in
front of all those people ‘that I
know,” said Ziener. “I didn’t really
play the way I wanted to, but it was a
good experience anyway. It feels like
I never left.”

“Our primary motivationlin the
match was to recognize Krista in
front 'of friends and family,”
remarked Pitt co’ach Shelton Col-
lier. “When I get a chance to help an
athlete get recognized, I like to take

. that opportunity.”

i“_This match got a lot of people
out,” Ziener said. “The girls’ and the
boys’ team came out. It helps both
Pitt and North‘ Allegheny, and I 1

think it would be great if we could do

this with more schools. Maybe even _

smaller schools, because it's really
exciting to have college teams play
at a high school.”

“We respect (Pitt). They're a
nice club, defensively but I
think they were more. power-
ful last year.” 0U coach
Jamie Ianni

Ziener‘s high school team finished
second at the PIAA championship
in the spring in Class AAA after ﬁn-
ishing fourth in the WPIAL.

When Rupp set for the OU team
in 1980 and 1981 seasons, the team
had» a different coach. Rupp says
that Jamie Ianni, Ohio’s head coach,
is “definitely more knowledgable.
They use basically the same offenses
as when I was there, but they’ve
improved since then. I have no
regrets whatsoever [about coming to
Pitt].’.’ '

Rupp indicated that the match
was not on the same level as those
Pitt played over the weekend‘.,“We
could’ve been more energetic. When
the other side of the net is not exe-
cuting real well, it's difficult at times

The contrast is about as stark as
can be imagined. It is about a pic-
neer —— one of the first immortals to
set and leave his mark on Pitt foot-
ball — and a team‘ that nowadays is
reeling faster than .a trout fisher-
man’s favorite ﬂyrod. .

City of Pittsburgh.

Yes, they’re going to rename the
lane straddling Pitt Stadium Suther-
land Drive. It couldn’t happen to a
better person.

After entering Pitt Dental School
in 1914, Sutherland played for four
seasons, losing only one game all
along. An All-America guard,
Sutherland went on to coach the

Panthers from 1924-38,and led the '

that won't evoke any images of the

Jock ‘Sutherland years. -But four

prevalent too often thisseason —
A anything can happen.

“The Naval Academy’s already
played Lehigh [31-l4] and Princeton
[41-3] to really sharpen their skills,"

Fazio-said. “'It’s nice to know the
Naval Academy is executing the
plans they have. I’d like to see us
pick some of those passes off.”
Indeed, Midshipmen coach Gary
Tranquill may have gone more to
the passing lanes ever since losing

for us to play our gameon our side
of the net.”

The setter said that OU middle
blocker Margaret Garwood had
improved, greatly since she was a
freshman and Rupp was a sopho-
more. “She passed and blocked
really nice."

Ohio coach Ianni, whose team fell‘

to 6-12, said that Pitt played well
defensively. “We always respect
them. They’re a nice club defen-
sively, but I think they were more
powerful last year." Ianni said that
Pitt_’s forced conversion to the 5-1, a
one-setter attack, is not as effective
as the 6-2 Pitt utilized last season.
Ironically, Rupp did not play in that
match due to injury. ' -

Ianni said that her team took Mid
American Conference leader West-

ern Michigan (who Pitt plays at‘

Thanksgiving) tofour games —— one
of only two teams to do so. “Today
just wasn’t one of their days,” she
said following the match.

Collier said that it was “psycho-
logically" good to have this weekend
off before the Pitt Classic on Nov. 2
and 3. “We’re looking forward to
another shot at Penn State.”

The Pitt,News, Wednesday, October 24, 1984

Students should elect coach

By Dale Moore
The Pitt News

Another week has passed and
another loss has been added to the
Panthers‘ already lopsided record.
E‘»"e'ryone agrees that something
should be done: While I was watch-
ing the presidential debates the other
night I came up with the idea to solve
all of the Panthers‘ problems in the
future. (I wasn't watchingthe debate
to get educated or anything, it just
happened to be on before the
Cowboys-Saints football game.)

As 1 was saying, I have the solu-

' tion to Pitt's problems in the future.

We elect the football coach.

Why not have the alumni elect the
coach of the Panthers? We are the
ones who have to put up with the
embarrassment when the Panthers
lose. We are the ones who have to
listen to the Penn Staters and, worst
of all, those Hoopies from West Vir-
ginia. We deserve the right to pick
the man that will guide us,.'our com-
mander in chief. ‘

The coach could be elected to a
four-year term, time enough to
recruit his own team, then be up for
re-election to a two-year term. Of
course, any losing season would be
grounds for impeachment, where
the alumni would decide whether to
give the coach another chance or
send him packing.

When would we hold this elec-
tion? It could be at the start of the
second term,.but this really wouldn't
be very fair. Imagine the Panthers‘
going 12-0 during the regular season
(Try hard, you can do it. It wasn't
that long ago that the Panthers
could, too.): They go to New
Orleans and lose to someb_ody in the
Sugar Bowl. That coach went 12-1
and will come home to find out he
doesn't have a home anymore.
Holding them after the bowl games
would be a bad idea.

The best time to have this race,
then, would be right after the regular
season was over. Things would still
be fresh in the alumni’s minds and
since the last game of the season is
against Penn State, it would be a
great incentive to beat the Lions.

Anyone could enter the race for
football coach, experienced or not,
just like real politics. There could be
debates sponsored by the Golden
Panthers where, instead of such
depressing topics as nuclear war and
unemployment, the arguments
would center around a two tight end
attack and why the coach didn't go
for the first down on fourth-and-one
against Oklahoma. Much more rele-
vant to Panther fans.

Another thing that this process
would do for the Panther fans would
be to get them more involved in the
game. The coach would listen more
to alumni. And when a section stood

up and held up a sign that said
“Pass." you’d better believe that he
would pass.

However, some special rules
would have to be proposed. Coaches
wouldn‘t be allowed to schedule
their own opponents — or else we
would always be playing West Vir-
ginia Wesleyan or someone like that.
Another rule that would be a must is
that a coach could not be impeached
while the game was in progress. So a
coach would have piece of mind
knowing that if he starts a game as
coach he will finish it as coach. Talk
about job security.

This system should eliminate all
the problems with the Panther foot-
ball team, and if it does, it could
spread across college campuses like
wildfire. Pitt would be known as the
home of democracy and football
freedom. Congress might even tack
something onto the Constitution
about this new inalienable freedom.
With the Panther’s fans picking their
coach, they would be the best team
in the country. Why, they would
have to be. Panther fans are never
wrong, are they?

0Although I'm not a person who
often gloats, I would like to take this
time to remind my readers that a
couple of weeks back I told them
that the Steelers with David Wood-
ley were little better off then the
Steelers with Cliff Stoudt. Ivhate to
say I told you so, but! told you so.

 ounsr...

n,-,; 13:4:

This week's excursion to Indiana- -

polis turned out to be a vintage Mr.
Hyde performance by Woodley, as
hisﬂinconsistency kept the Steelers
frcﬁh the end zone, and in the end,
from the win.

Woodley, who got the starting
nod even after backup Mark
Malone filled in for him the week
before and handed the San Fran-
cisco 49ers their only loss of the sea-

son, took the Steelers into the end

zone only once all day before being
relieved on the last two series by
Malone. -

Why Steeler coach Chuck Noll
started Woodley over Malone is a‘
mystery to me but I did hear a rumor
that Woodley is Noll‘s nephew on
his wife’s side. That might explain it.
My sympathy to Mrs. N011, and to
Steeler fans as long as Woodley is
starting.

0A friend (yes, I do have one or
two) suggested to me that I add a
new feature to this weekly column.
He said, “Why don’t you pick a
game of the week? That way every-
one could bet against it and make a
lot of money.” . ‘

I have shaken offthat insult on my
ability to pick a winner and would
like to-remind my friend that laugh-

ing at someone else’s misfortunes is -

cruel. However, I am going to take
his advice and start the new segment

A of Moore Ideas.

Big East
tough for ;

racquet
women
By Bob Travers K;

The Pitt News

Welcome to Big Time. It’s a place
filled with scholarships and year-
round training. It’s a place where the
citizens play tennis with visions of
future rankings in their heads. Big
Time was not kind to the members
of the Pitt women's tennis team.

The Lady Panthers finished last in

the Big East Championships heldsﬁ

this past weekend at Syracuse, New
York. They simply could not com-
pete with the scholarship and talent-
laden schools like Syracuse and
Boston College. Most disappointing
for the team was its failure to give up ,
to head coach George Dieffenbach’s
pre-tournament goal of finishing
eighth or higher. ‘

‘i

The only Pitt player able to win

even a single match was freshman '

Carrie deVera, whose early wins

propelled her into the semi-finals 0251

the No. 5 singles bracket, where she’
finally was defeated. “I did really
well,” said deVera, who raised more
than a few eyebrows with her play. “I
was surprised at how well I played,
but I always go out there with the
attitude that I can win no matter
who I’m playing. It’s just that at the
Big East, the competition is so much
tougher than we’ve faced all year.”

Just as tough for deVera was a
shot she took in the neck by an
errant tennis ball. “It wasn’t even a
shot that I got hit with,” deVera said,

explaining the freak accident. “It .

was in a doubles match, and Ste-
phanie [Nelson] and I had won two
games in a row to tie the score. Well,
a girl on St. John's who had an atti-
tude problem got mad and threw the
ball toward us. It was accidental that
it hit me, but she shouldn’t have
done it.”,St. John’s was penalizeﬁ}
one game for the incident.

Upon returning to singles play,
deVera found herself bothered by
the injury. “It bothered me some. It
really hurt then, and it still hurts
now, but I don’t think I could have
won even if I,didn’t get hurt.”

Other Lady Panthers did not-meet
with the samesuccess as deVera’.
“They have a way of making you
play bad,” said Stephanie Nelson in
summing up the competition. “You

can’t be as consistent because they‘:

are so good." .

Still, the team had reason for

"optimism despite the disappointing

season finale. “We played well, but
we didn’t do well,” said Jenny

. Leach, who played in the No. 3 posi-

tion. “Everybody played hard and it
was disappointing after having such
a good season [the team finished 9-
4]. We’ll just have to do better next
year. The thing is, we weren't that
much worse than these other teams,"
It’s frustrating because you really-
want to win, but you can’t always
rise to the occasion and do it. But we .
did gain a lot of good experience; it
was a really great weekend. We
learned a lot and saw some terriﬁc
tennis.” i

%S%oc:Cer
team
finally
scores

By Kirsten Gostony
The Pitt News

After scoring only 12 goals in their
previous 11 games,-the Pitt soccer
team couldn’t reasonably brag
about being an offensive machine.
But with an impressive 5-1 victory

AV ovegt-Edinboro on Saturday morn-

ing, however, they may_have finally
conquered their scoring drought.

The game got off to a slow start,
with Pitt not playing up to par. Their
sole goal of the half came from jun-
ior Rick Burkholder, sending them
into the locker room with a ‘l-l tie at
the half.

So _what sparked the ﬁre? “Two‘
things,” claims Burkholder. “First of
all, when we went into the locker

R roo at halftime, Coach Luxbacher
" tolo"us he didn’t have anything to

say to us. That’s when we realized we
had to do thingsfor ourselves if we
wanted to make things happen.

Secondly,” he continued, “was the
move of Dave Moss to center mid-
fielder, which made everything
click.”

Less than a minute into the second

 Moss scored his first of two

goals, which triggered the scoring
drive.» Within 20 minutes the Panth-
ers beefed up the score with goals
fromjunior Victor Hugo and sopho-
more David Van Newkirk, as well as
Moss’ second. “Scoring is conta-
gious,” said Luxbacher. “Once we
started scoring everyone wanted in
on theyact.”

“This game gaveus a lot of confi-
dence,” said Scott Reimer. “It’s the
firsqgame in which we scored more‘
than two goals. Plus, almost eve-

ryone got to play, which helped our

overall morale.”

But the Panthers will face some
strong defensive challenges starting
with West Virginia. today at 3:30
p.m. “As of last week they were
ranked no. I in the N. A. l. A., ”
stated Luxbacher,” and they've
beaten two teams which are ranked
in the.Top— 10 in the nation, Division
I, — the University of North Caroli-
na and_Geo_rge Mason University.”

“We’re coming up against great
‘deigfisive teams, such as WVW.
Grove City and CMU, who has had
8 out of 10 shutouts,” stated Burk-
.holder. “But this is the first time
we’ve really scored well and I think
we’ve finally captured the feeling.”

They'll have to play their best to stay
' in this afternoon's match at Wes-
leyan, but with a strong effort there's
no reason they can’t be competitive.

Joe Luxbacher

Luxbacher leads well

By Teresa Varley
The Pitt News

Joe Luxbacher is only in his
first season ashead coach of the
University of Pittsburgh soccer
team,but he is already receiving
rave reviews from his players.

“Joe has really had a positive
effect on the team,” said junior
Vic Hugo. “The enthusiasm of

the team has improved 100 per- .

cent. There is also a lot more
unity on the team. I am
impressed with the way Joe has
worked to make us as strong as
we are on the field as well as off.”

Luxbacher, of Upper Saint
Clair, took over the helm of the
Panther soccer team after Leo
Bemis retired. No stranger to the
Pitt scene, Luxbacher served as
an assistant coach in 1975 and
1983 and is a former member of

~ the Panther soccer squad. Being

a head coach means added
responsibilities for Luxbacher,

_ “Everyone tries a lot harder now.

but that doesn’t bother him.

“I am really enjoying myself,”
Luxbacher said. “It is a new
experience. It is a real challenge
and a lot of work. There are

many ups and downs and it can
be frustrating. But I am enjoying
it."

Luxbacher is not the only one
enioving it. The Panthers got off
to a 6-4-1 record, and his players
are happy to_ have him as their
coach.
with the soccer program," said
junior Rick Burkholder. “I am
sorry that I am ajunior and I will
be leaving soon. It is a great pro-
gram and Joe is going to take it
to the top.”

Luxbacher has a winning atti-
tude, and that has rubbed off on
the team. -

“Joe has had a great effect,”
said senior Jamie Katzin.

We want to win more. There is a
much better attitude among the

players and we _care about
winning.”

The first season is always
tough for a head coach, and
making things even harder for
Luxbacher is all ofthe young tal-
ent on his team.

' “We have a very young team,”
Luxbacher said. “You have to try
and find the best positions for
everybody to. play. It is not easy.”

Some of the young players on
Luxbachers’s team include fresh-
man Craig Freund and Dan
Liberati. Both of them are mak-
ing strong contributions to the
program already and they are
happy to be playing for
Luxbacher.

‘‘I got offers from a lot of
schools,” Liberati explained. “I
am glad I came to Pitt. Joe was a
big inﬂuence on my decision. He
is a great coach. He is real easy to
get along with and has a lot. of
class.”

Although they are young, the
Panthers are loaded with talent
and should be ab}e to attain the
goals Luxbacher has set.

“Hopefully we will play as well
as we can,” Luxbacher said. “We
have to develop consistency and
play up to our capability. I .am
hoping that we have a pretty suc-

cessful season. The main goal

though is to try to constantly
improve.”

Saturday against Miami.

“They were throwing early, firing
at us right off the bat,” Fazio said,
probably referring to quarterback
Bernie Kosar. “Unfortunately we
weren’t'applying the pressure and
they took advantage ofthat. This
week we have to be in the right
spots.”

v After linebacker Troy Benson’s
l 10 tackles there's a cliff-like drop to
fellow linebacker Caesar Aldisert’s

,. ?'_38, Steve Apke’s 57 and safety Bill

Callahan’s 48. All four had played in
the Panther’s seven games to date,
but defensive end Chris Doleman
hasn’t._ His 36 tackles after missing
two games due to turf toe points up
the less than imposing strike force
-capability on the front line.
Contributing, too, has been the
absence of sophomore Chuckie Wil-
liams, a 6-6, 245-lb. hellion whose
knees lately have been plastered with

red and white F RAGILE warnings.-

After going down against South
Qrolina two week_s ago, the defen-
sive end will miss the—Navy game in
“a week-by-week thing,” Fazio said.

- “He loses a lot [by not playing],”
he continued. “The big thing with

him, he has to get his ﬂuidity back, '

move around in traffic and not drag
the leg. If he hadn't gotten hurt two
games ago we‘d have had a pretty
good pass rush last week against
Miami.” _ »

The drought-like point produc-
tion aside this year, the Pitt defense
has turned inone of those Jekyll-
ﬁyde debacles. The opposition has
been outgaining the Panthers’ 370
yards to 29§.4;;"In a complete turna-
round, Pitt last year posted 376.3

yards per ‘game to the opponents
289 8 ‘

Which brings up an offense which

turned in “the worst performance of —

the year” against Miami, Fazio
admitted. “[Quarterback] Chris
Jelic] had some success early, par-

:»»(-aecularly on two plays that could

have made his day better. A dropped
pass early in the game would have
given him a first down and another
was complete bu ;alled back on an
illegal procedure.“

Jelic_eventually threw three inter- _

ceptions and kept the passing totals
below 200 once again with 170
through the air. Even though the
man he replaced, John Congemi, is
healthy again, Jelic will start against
Navy, not necessarily guaranteed 60
playing minutes.

“Johnny had a complete rest,”
Fazio_ said of thejunior who’s gimpy
ankle, ransacked shoulder and bat-
tered head» have succumbed to heal-
ing. “Any ailments he did have are
cleared up.-I’d be very suprised if he

' were not able to play against Navy. I

don't know when I’d go to him. You
have to see how the game goes. If the
situation arises, he has started games
and has played."

GRID BITS: Middle guard Bob
Schilken (ankle), center Ed Miller
(shoulder) and defensive end Apke
(shoulder) will ' not play against
Navy. _

A crowd of 30,000 is expected Sat-
urday afternoon on what will be
Banner Day sponsored by the
Golden Panthers. Several cash
prizes are in the offing for the most
creative. All, those wishing to have
their banners judged must register
