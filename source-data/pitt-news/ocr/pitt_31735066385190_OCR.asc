local
support

By Lou Grieco

Staff Writer

Standing in front of a statue of
John F. Kennedy,
Dukakis compared himself to the
slain president while speaking at
a rally in McKeesport on Friday.

”Please remember 1960. They
were a strong ticket, weren't
they?” Dukakis asked the crowd
inJFK Memorial Park.

Dukakis said that although he
is behind in the polls, he is still
in the race. He noted that Kenne-
dy won in 1960 by a margin of
120,000 votes out of more than
70 million cast. ' L

”Remember, we're the under-
dogs. So were the Los Angeles
Dodgers,” Dukakis said.

Dukakis promised to create
new jobs in Western Pennsylva-
nia, saying that the steel industry
could be revitalized in this coun-
try. He also mentioned the new
trade bill that his running mate,
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, helped push
through the Senate.

Dukakis attacked Vice Presi-
dent Bush for giving tax breaks to
the wealthy and for failing to fight
drugs effectively.

”Cocaine is about the only
thing that is cheaper today than
eight years ago,” Dukakis said.
”We’re going to have a real
[drug] war instead of a phony
war.”

Dukakis said that he took full
responsibility for the crimes com-
mitted by a Massachusetts

prisoner on a weekend furlough.
He added that his father was once
beaten and robbed, and his only
brother was killed in a hit-and-run
car accident.

’’I don't need any lectures

[about crime victims] from Mr.
Bush,” Dukakis said, calling Bus
”cynical.”

The Software Engineering
Institute was once again the
target of protesters seeking to
expose ”Star Wars” research.
A vigil for peace, followed by
a press conference, was held
at Warner Hall on Carnegie
Mellon’s campus last Thurs-

, day and Friday.

Vince Eirene, one of the pro—
test organizers, stated that he
was ”morally outraged that it
[Carnegie Mellon] was origi-
nally an art school” but has
been ”turned into a war
college."

According to research con-
ducted for the protesters by Ed
Pervin, ”SEI has been caught

in the act of supplying soft-
ware products for the planning
of nuclear war.”

According to the Council on
Economic Priorities, ”Between
1983 and 1986, Carnegie Mel-
lon accepted no less than six
‘Star Wars’ research con-
tracts.”

It still has not been deter-
mined if any of the contracts
are connected to research
done by the SEI.

According to Pervin, the SEI
is writing software for an iner-
tial navigation system in which
information is gathered about
a ship's position and relative
motion.

”SEl is writing the parts up
to, but not including, the part
that actually f_ires these mis-

siles,” said Pervin,

The press conference was
held Friday afternoon in front
of Warner Hall. The protesters
held a banner that said, ”Earth
Peace — No Star Wars.”

Eirene said that Provost An-
gel Jordan promised to give
copies of six SEI contracts to
Carnegie Mellon’s under-
ground newspaper The Stu-
dent Union, but has not yet
done so.

Eirene said that Carnegie
Mellon and SE! are teaming up
to become a vital part of the
U.S. military. Eirene feels that
CMU should not be involved
because.”academia should be
about preserving lives, not
destroying them.”

president of the College Young
Democrats at Pitt.

Frank Poff of Beaver County
said, ’’I think the rally was great,
especially about the steel

problem. I don't think the steel in-

dustry is dead.” Poff said he’

blamed President Reagan for the
economic problems in Western
Pennsylvania.

CAS faculty examines
entrance requirements

By Mike Seperack

For The Pitt News

While the profile of entering

freshmen in the College of Arts _

and Sciences is good, there are
still many freshmen with poor
skills, CAS Dean Mary Briscoe
reported at the CAS faculty meet-
ing Thursday in the David
Lawrence Auditorium.
According to Briscoe, 85 per-
cent of CAS freshmen graduated
in the top 40 percent of their
class. Also, average SAT scores
for entering freshmen increased
from 990 to 1,010 this year. Bris-
coe pointed out that despite these
increases, there was a larger per-
centage of students who tested

into basic writing and algebra
courses.

CAS will be taking a number of
steps to combat this problem, in-
cluding beginning a program
next summer for ”high risk but
talented” students who will be
freshmen in the fall of 1989.

CAS is also considering rein-
troducing freshman seminars.

The goal of these seminars is to

”get the kids into a real class with
a real faculty member,” accord-
ing to Briscoe. ”They should see
a faculty member up close, not
just from the back of a lecture
hall,” she added.

Briscoe also pointed out that

Hurricane Joan kills at least 50 in Nicaragua

MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) —
Hurricane Joan killed at least 50
people and left 300,000 home-
less in its rampage across Nic-
aragua, officials said Sunday.
Rain drenched the country while
the government tried to organize
rescue efforts and restore com-
munications. .

The storm left another 21 peo-
ple dead in Costa Rica and four
dead in Panama, bringing the
death toll for its six-day trip across
the Caribbean to at least 111.

More than 150 people were
missing.

Joan slowly weakened into a
tropical storm over land but
strengthened again when it
reached the Pacific. No longer an
Atlantic hurricane, it was given a
new name in the sequence of this
year's Pacific storms — Tropical
Storm Miriam.

Hurricane Joan blasted into the
east coast city of Bluefields with
125,, mph winds early Saturday
and marched across the Iowa-
sized country of 3 million, leav-
ing a trail of death and destruc-
tion before reaching Managua
about 10 p.m. Saturday.

Whales hesitate as
Eskimos clear route

BARROW, Alaska (AP) — Two
young whales trapped by ice
balked Sunday at following a nar-
row escape route to open water
that was being carved with chain
saws by Eskimos who ordinarily
hunt whales.

Rescuers said that even if
everything went as planned, it
would be at least Wednesday
night before they could get the
whales as far as the ridge.

While high-technology equip-
ment poured into Barrow during
the weekend, Eskimos using
chain saws and strong backs
made the most progress at free-
ing the California gray whales
from a tiny breathing hole.

Rescuers said they feared the
whales were spooked by an un-
derwater shoal. North Slope
Borough biologist Geoff Carroll
said most of the water in the area
is about 20 feet deep, compared
to only 12 or 13feet of water in
the shoal.

Mine fire victim
tired of relocating

KULPMONT, Pa. (AP) ~ Near-
Iy two years ago, the federal
government paid 76-year-old
Anna Panikarcheck to move from
her home, which was threatened
by an underground mine fire in
Centralia.

With a separate underground
fire closing in on her new home
in a rustic Northumberland
County development five miles
from Centralia, Panikarcheck told
her son she was staying put.

”I don't want to go through

Contras questioned

WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Contras, the Nicaraguan rebels
President Reagan lauded as ”free-

policy, are fading into history.

Supporters and opponents alike
say the rebels, who once claimed
to be inflicting severe damage on

refugees huddled in camps along
the Honduran border.

Rain interferes with
Homecoming events

By Laurie Lehosky
Staff Writer

This year's Homecoming
theme was ”Under the Big Top,”
and a big top was needed to keep
the festivities dry as rain drizzled
on Pitt's Homecoming, 1988.

Due to the rain, the Homecom-
ing Parade was canceled, official-
ly making Homecoming begin

with the Pitt vs. Navy game at-

1:30 p.m. The stadium was filled
with blue and gold ponchos as
fans endured, ignoring the rain.

A special halftime ceremony
was prepared by the Pitt Varsity
Band and the Alumni Band for
the return of former Panther
Rodger Kingdom and the crown-
ing of the Homecoming Queen

university-wide statistics for en-
tering scale, graduation, and
retention/attrition rates, which are
higher than the national average,
may be deceiving because many
students at Pitt require more than
four years to graduate. In addition
to low skills, Briscoe attributes
this to the number of students
who work while attending Pitt.

many students who work 18 to

These students often take only 12
credits a semester in order to
balance work with school. ”You
just can’t graduate in four ars
on 12 credits per semester.

In a separate report at the meet-
ing, CAS Dean of Faculty Peter
Koehler said that the need for
space is the primary concern of
CAS right now, and that it is even
more important than the budget.

”You can't just write a check

for space,” said Koehler. ”Some—
times it’s like fighting World War
I all over again, trying to gain a
foot here and a foot there.”

When asked about the goals of
President Posvar as he saw them
in a recent meeting with the
president, Koehler said, ’’I did not
find a discrepancy with the goals.
The problem is one of finding the
means.”

After Kingdom's victory lap,
university President Wesley Pos-
'\/ar. presented Kingdom and his
mother with pictures of Kingdom
jumping the hurdle on his way to
the gold.

‘'1 feel really good about Pitt
giving me this homecoming. It
shows the amount of respect that
Pitt gives their athletes,” said
Kingdom.

According to Kingdom, when
he was attending Pitt, he was, at
first, uncertain about things in his
life. Kingdom said that Pitt helped ‘
him to grow and achieve his
dreams.

”When I won the gold medal
in the 1i0—meter hurdles, it was
exciting and overwhelming; but
when I won the second gold me-

.dal, I felt better to be the best in
the world," said Kingdom.

Concerning advice to young
athletes, Kingdom added, ”Hold
on to your dreams, and believe

faith, and your dreams will come
true.” .

Homecoming didn't end with
Pitt’s victory of 52-6 over Navy.
It continued with the formal,
which began at 11 p.m. on the
Gateway Clipper.

According tosenior Kim Tay-
lor, member of the Pitt Program
Council's Homecoming Commit-
tee, the formal was successful.
Over lOO tickets were sold for the
formal. ‘ ‘

Steelers break slide, defeat Broncos 39-21

By Tom Danyluk
Staff Writer

”You have to fire the steel a lit-
tle bit to make it hard,” Pittsburgh
Steelers head coach Chuck Noll
said after his team's 39-21 past-
ing of the Denver Broncos at
Three Rivers Stadium yesterday.

The late John Facenda, in one
of his epic NFL Films pieces,
couldn't have said it any better.

But then again, with the way
the Steelers have been playing for
the last month, the narrator of that
potential video wouldmore fit-
tingly be Daffy Duck and
produced by Looney Tunes, not
NFL Films.

What the Emperor was talking
about was the method of coer-
cion that he and his fellow

Steelers from a sorry, six—game
losing streak.

After last week's 34-14 whip-
ping at the hands of the Houston
Oilers, the Steelers had dropped
to 1-6, the worst record in_ the
_league, and unquestionably were
in the city's doghouse, with Noll,
Old Yeller himself, the first
hound stuffed inside.

Many cried for Noll’s resigna-
tion. Others cried for the team's
resignation. Former Steelers
defensive end Dwight White said
the team lacked ”gizzards.”

One Steelers supporter, wrap-
ped up in all of his fanaticism
was, heard screaming for the
return of gulp, Mark Malone as
a solution.

Yep, that bad.

”At the beginning of the week,

we were a very depressed foot-
ball team,” said Noll after yester-
day's win. ”There was no
question about it. It's no fun with
that kind of streak, but I think [the
players] worked very well and
worked very hard at just recover-
ing. The way we practiced, the
way we did everything was in an
upbeat manner.  I think they got
a bit of that this week.”

And, in turn, Denvergot that
and a lot more stuffed down its
throat on Sunday.

Said Broncos coach Dan

Reeves, ’’I knew we were com- —

ing into a hornets nest. We knew
that coming into the ballgame.
That’s the reason I felt we would
play extremely hard because if
we didn't, we were going to get
beat.”

”They outplayed us, out-hit us,
everything,” said running back
Tony Dorsett.

One thing to remember was
that this wasn't your typical Bron-
cos football club. This team was
injured, i.e., fireballing quarter-
back John Elway was sidelined
with a bum ankle he suffered last
week against Atlanta. So behind
the center was a sixth-year play-
er named Gary Kubiak.

Kubiak is" a’ steady guy. He's
been in Denver as long as Elway
and knows Reeves’ system very
well. And he’s pulled out some
dramatic wins for the Broncos
when Elway has gone down on
previous occasions.

Sunday was not one of those
occasions, as the Steelers relent-
lessly buried Kubiak and the Den-

ver offense, while unleashing an
unexpectedly ferocious rushing
attack, one that helped put the
game away for Pittsburgh not too
long after the third play from
scrimmage.

On third—and-one at its own
36-yard line, Pittsburgh called for
an off—right tackle running play.
Rodney Carter took the handoff
from quarterback Todd Black-
ledge and raced 64 yards for a 7-0
lead.

”He just broke through the
line, and when you break
through the line in short—yardage
situations, you don't have anyone
back there helping out,” said
Denver linebacker Karl Meck|en-

burg. ”That play really helped '9;

their confidence.”

NBA exhibitions not at all like the real thing

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

Friday night's Second Annual
Cameron Coca—Cola NBA Chal-
lenge at the Civic Arena was a
sight for the sore eyes of starved,
pro hoops fans in Pittsburgh,
even though only a half-capacity
crowd viewed the Atlanta
Hawks’ 103-96 come—from—
behind victory over the Detroit
Pistons.

While the fans enjoyed perfor-
mances by the likes of Isiah Tho-
mas, Dominique Wilkins, Glenn
”Doc" Rivers, Bill Laimbeer and
Darryl Dawkins, among others,
the players themselves viewed
the exhibition game as nothing
more than a warm—up for the
regular season, which begins
Nov. 6.

’’I think you can't really tell
how good a team we are because
we're playing a lot of people; see
how fit the rookies are —— experi-

ment,” said Wilkins.

”The win or the loss does not
mean anything,” Hawks guard
Reggie Theus said.

Theus added that ”if you come
here to play a game, you might
as well try to win it. You don't put
a tremendous emphasis on the
‘you gotta win’ kind of stuff, be-
cause you're trying to use differ-
ent combinations; you're trying to
play different people. But your
objective is to try to use presea-
son the best that you can.”

Theus commented that profes-
sional pride sometimes makes a
player forget that he is playing in
an exhibition game, not the
world championship.

”As a professional, I think you
have to have professional pride,
and when you come and step on
the floor, you do everything you
can to do the right things to win
the basketball game within the
limitations of what you're trying
to do as a team.”

Atlanta coach Mike Fratello
said he just likes to see his team
trying to win during the presea-
son, whether they ultimately win
or lose the contest.

’’If a team comes out on the
floor and lays down, then I think
a message can be sent that way,
where the other team [doesn't]
even want to play with us,”
Fratello commented.

Pistons forward—center John
Salley, a two—year NBA veteran,
added that the exhibition games
are a means of gaining fan sup-
port from around the country,
particularly in cities without
professional franchises.

”|t’s good to have fans all over
the place. Even though this‘ is not
an NBA town, it's still a part of
the United States, and it's better
to have fans,” Salley said.

The game saw the Pistons jump
out to an early lead and hold a
5-10 point margin until midway

"We’ve been giving up a lot of
yards in the running game, and
we've been able to keep people
from scoring touchdowns and
been holding the field goals,”
said Reeves. "I knew if we came
out and gave them confidence
early [on] we were going to be in
trouble.”

Carter rushed for a career—high
105 yards, while teammate Mer-
ril Hoge contributed 94.

Said Carter on the longest run
of his pro career, ''It was
designed to cross them up. We
practiced it all week, and I'm glad
that I didn't run out of gas.”

That scamper gave the Steelers
confidence, all right. Fromthat
point on, Pittsburgh unreserved-
ly led the 4-4 Broncos to
slaughter.

pleased with the efficiency of
his team, consisting mostly of
reserves filling in for a plethora
of injured starters.

"Each week I think we're
getting better as a team, and I
think the thing you can't meas-
ure right now is the ex-
perience that all these players
are getting,” Gottfried said.

''I said before the season
that we were a good young
football team. I thought that
we'd eventually get some ex-
perience and develop into
that. Somewhere down the
line, all this is going to pay off.
Right now they're becoming
seasoned  not veterans, but
they're getting so much ex-

perience. We're just getting gs

some people on the field that
the future holds very bright."

Perhaps the finest perfor-
mance was turned in by not
one, but six Panther running
backs. Richards led the way
with 207 yards and two touch-

ldowns on the ground, fol-

lowed by Dan Crossman's 50
yards and one touchdown;
Ricky Turner's 37-yard perfor-

mance; David Moore's two Q)

rushes for 11 yards; and full-

_ back Ronald Redmon's seven

yards and two touchdowns.

This behind a patchwork
offensive line decimated by in-
juries.

"I believe the strengths of
our ballclub are sideline-to-
sideline and deep. We've just

got some pretty good speed 3‘

back there," Gottfried said.

But the offensive attack
didn't stop there. Quarterback
Darnell Dickerson connected
on six of 16 passes for 135
yards, including a 57-yard

bomb to Reggie Williams, V‘

playing in place of an injured
Billy Osborn, that set up
Richards’ second score.

The Panthers churned out
489 total yards, averaging 7.0
yards per play.

"Darnell's a threat throwing
the ball, he's a threat running
the option," Gottfried said.

Defensively, the Panthers al- _

lowed only 124 total yards —
33 on the ground —— and held
Navy QB Gary Mclntosh to
five completions.

Linebacker Jerry Olsavsky
led the way with 10 tackles,
giving him 86 on the year.
Prentiss Wright and Tom Sims
combined for 11 tackles and
four sacks that amounted to 37
yards lost.

The Panthers ran through a
Navy offensive line that has
seen five players undergo
season-ending surgery, sack-
ing Mclntosh seven times for
a loss of 64 yards.

Although the Panthers have
been back on track, winning
their last two games after los-
ing three in a row, Gottfried
stressed that the most impor-
tant aspect of the day came af-
ter the game ended.

''If there was ever a time that
an open date was needed, it is
surely needed here," Gottfried
said, referring to next Satur-
day, open thanks to the
rescheduling of the Syracuse
game, to be played Dec. 3.

through the fourth quarter,’ when \

DTheus and forward Cliff Leving-
ston went on a scoring spree. The
two combined for 21 points in
the second half.

When asked how this game
comparedyto a regular season
contest between the same two
teams, Theus said, ”From what I
understand — I'm speaking sec-
ond hand Atlanta—Detroit

games are not real exciting.

They're usually trench games, not _

balls. The game, for a good por-
tion of tonight, was very com-
petitive.” ’

Theus was obtained in an off-
season trade with the Sacramen-
to Kings, and this was his first
game against the Pistons in an At-
lanta uniform. '

The victory moved Atlanta's
record to 2-3, while Detroit lost
its first game against four wins.

points before the first Denver
score — 256 total yards rushing
—— nearly 400 yards in total
offense, many of which came
from an array of trick plays —
reverses, halfback option passes,
screen passes, that, according to
Blackledge, ”we’ve had in our
book all along. For some reason,
the coaches decided to use
them.”

’’I got those in the mail from
this fan, and we thought we’d put
[them] in,” explained Noll. ’’I
don't reveal my sources. Think
I'm going to share this guy with
anybody else? You're crazy.”

”They opened every door they
had today,” said Elway, who

could only watch helplessly in _

street clothes from the sideline.

The Steeler defense had its part
in the victory as well, allowing
Denver only 45 yards on the
ground, far below its season aver-

age of 128.4, and 285 yards

through the air, 74 of those com-
ing on a late fourth-quarter touch-
down pass from Kubiak’s backup,
Ken Karcher, to Ricky Nattiel.
Pittsburgh's defense also forced
four turnovers and stopped the
Broncos offense 13 of the 15

times it was in third or fourth-

down situations.

’’I played poorly,” said Kubiak.
”They didn't blitz. They just
dropped eight men back and only
rushed three and let me make the
mistakes, which I did by throw-
ing the interceptions.” Kubiak
completed only 15 of 27 passes
for 157 yards.

Steelers kicker Gary Anderson
broke a team record by booting
six field goals in one game,
eclipsing his old record of five.

Alongside Anderson's kicks,
Pittsburgh scored on a 1—yard
plunge by Blackledge and a
24-yard pass to Carter, both in the
first half. “

Freshman Richards adds to impressive sta ts.

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

A few notes from Pitt's 52-6
win over Navy last Saturday:

0 ”Swervin’ ” Curvin Richards
continued to dazzle with 207
yards on 17 carries and two
touchdowns. His most exciting
run of the afternoon was a
68—yarder up the gut for a touch-
down. Richards broke numerous
tackles and further solidified him-
self as the Panthers’ No. 1 run-
ning back.

”Curvin is really an exciting
player,” Pitt coach Mike Gott-
fried said. ”He has so much leg

strength; it just seems like he
breaks so many tackles. He's a

’ long-ball threat every time he gets

the ball.’’

. 0 The 52-point score marked
the fourth time this season that
the Panther offense has scored
over 42 points. It is also the fourth
time that the Panther defense has
held opponents to 10 points or
lower. All this in the same four
games.

0 Linebacker Jerry Olsavsky
again led the.Pitt defense with 10
tackles, five unassisted. This gives
Olsavsky 86 for the season.

Walker said. ’’I just didn't have

cut the sleeves off my yellow

to me, ‘Who do you think we are,
the Miami Dolphins?’ ”

   
      

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, October 24, i988

0 Pitt gained 353 total yards on
the ground; Navy gained only 33.
The Panthers threw for 135 yards;
the Middies gained just 90 via the
air. Total offensive domination,
any way you look at it.

0 One of the most ingenious
plays that Pitt ran on Saturday
was a counter—play to fullback
Dan Crossman.

Quarterback Darnell Dickerson
shoves the ball into Crossman’s
stomach, then turns to fake a
handoff to the tailback. Mean-
while, Crossman acts as if he is
blocking, then takes off down the
field. It worked to- perfection
against Navy, with Crossman run-

for your time.

ning for a 40-yard touchdown.
”Just me and Darnell know
when the play is coming," Cross-
man said. ”He gives me a little
signal, and we run it. Everybody
else thinks it will be a counter to
the other back, but I get the ball.”

\
0 Dickerson had another solid

game, completing six of 16 for
135 yards. This included a
57—yarder to the revitalized Reg-
gie Williams (two catches for 94
yards), in which Dickerson was
almost sacked twice before un-
loading the ball. It was a perfect
throw and led to the Panthers’
second TD.
