and which will do much to settle the
question of supremacy throughout the

‘The result of the game 1S of_ course
beyond any power of prognosticatlon.
W. &. J.’s chief advantage lies m.the

collegiate participation, nd in the

, conﬁdence begotten of connection for

several years with a winning combina-
tion. On the other-hand, Pitt has not

morrow imbued with a grim deter-
mination to ﬁght hard,‘ andato win.
Both Pitt and W. & J. have devel-
oped open play to a high point, and
theengagement tomorrow will abound
with thrills. The new lateral pass,

‘ which has not appeared in Pittsburgh

as yet, will probably make its debut,
and ‘many novel and weird formations
will be on trial.. W. & J. scored two
touchdowns on Yale and one against
Harvard, as a result of forward pass-
.es, so it will be up to_ Pitts ends and
backs to do some spilling.
Heil Plays Quarterback

Pitt goes into the game tomorrow
minus one of the a greatest players
who ever wore the Blue and Gold.
“Chalky” Williamson, known_to foo_t-
ball fandom all over America, will
not be able to take part in the battle
with the -followers of Fowell, since his
injured leg has not healed suﬂiciently
to permit his return to harness. The
blow is softened, however, by the
knowledge that in Hell the Varsity
has a field director who will get out
of the team every last ounce of energy
and fight. If W. & J. expect Pitt_to
display any weakness at this position
tomorrow, ,they are scheduled for a
great disappointment.

Every indication point to a crowd
that will make the turnstiles dizzy.
Interest- in the annual struggle be-
tween these rivals has never lagged;
but never before has it been so in-
tense as this year. The entire_foOt—
ball world is “watchfully waiting”
for the result of this conﬂict. The
showing made by both-of the contest-
‘ing elevens against some of the
strongest eastern teams has caused
the game tomorrow to’ be considered
by many critics not only as a Western
Pennsylvania championship battle, but
as 9.. national one as well.

Students Will Parade

The Wash-Jeﬂ’ aggregation will be
accompanied, as usual, by a host of
rooters. A few of the inhabitants
will be left behind to answer ﬁre
alarms; but with that single exception
the population of Washington on Sat-
urday will be nil. «

The rooting duel between the stu-
dents of Pitt and W. & J. will be not
the least of the features of the day.

‘The student bodies of both institutions

‘will parade the downtown section be-

«fore the game, and at Forbes field

the rooting argument will be second
only to the debate on the ﬁeld. An-
other cheering duel will be held at the
Nixon theater in t evening, when

post-game doings, and they are de-
termined to hold fast to the trophy.
W. & J. Betting Favorite.

Betting on the game slightly favors
the Red and Black, but this in itself
signiﬁes nothing. If all this year’s
favorites had won there would be
fewer empty pocketbooks among sport
fans. For further information along
this line, the reader is referred to
those-who bet on the Athletics against
the Braves, those who picked Yale to
smash W. &‘J., the unfortunates who
thought Penn’s game with F. & 
was a practice event for the Phila-
dqlphians, ‘and. for the unsophisti-
cated ones who surmised that the
Freshmen would win the class scrap.
Pitt fans are optimistic; in spite of the
bi-colored cloud on the horizon; and
if the supporters of the Varsity have
any fear of defeat tomorrow, they are
not showing it.

No 'matter how the battle gdes, it
will be some game. f it is Pitt’s' lot
to lose, Pitt can be a good loser; if
she wins, there is .no better winner.

DELTA nus TO BE  
INSTALLED T0-NIGHT

Gamma Sigma chapter of. Delta
Tau Delta will be installed this even-
ing at the Conservatory of _Music,
Dithridge st.’ This chapter was for-
merly the Alpha Alpha fraternity,_for
twelve years a prominent organiza-
tion at the Western ‘University of
Pennsylvania, and the Uniyersity of
Pittsburgh. The installation exer-
cises will be in charge of President
Jas. B. Curtis, Frank F. Rodgers and
the Washington & Jefferson chapter
of the Delta» Tau Delta fraternity.
Members of the fraternity from _all
over the country will be present, in-
cluding men prominent in national,
literary and religious life. The Pitts-
burgh Alumni Chapter will be well
represented at the installation.

Last evening an informal smoker
was held at the house, and many were
present. Besides the members of the
Delta Tau ' Delta fraternity, many
members of _ the University faculty
were present. .Chancellor Samuel B.
McCormick and Dr. S. Linhart atten-
ded. No formal exercises or regular
program was carried out, and every
one enjoyed himself fiilly. The Chan-
cellor expressed himself as with
the granting of the chapter V ,
the University, .and hoped that the
other local organizations will _in time
be equally successful. Music was
furnished by an orchestra, composed
of the members of the active chapter.

The visiting members will occupy a
block of seats in the ﬁrst section at
the W. & J.-Pitt game. Dr. Linhart
will entertain the Arch Chapter of the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity by giving
a box party in their honor. Preced-
ing the game, a general round-up will

 

Brother James 'B. Curtis will be the‘
honor guest at a banquet to be held

evening... Brother Samuel B. Linhart
will act as toastmaster, and speeches
will be made. by’ prominent members.

Dr. Linhart will conduct the visi-
tors through the University buildings
this afternoon, and special exhibits
and demonstrations have been pre-
pared for their beneﬁt .As these men
are prominent in educational and in-
dustrial circles,- the importance of
their visit is very evident. The fact
that a chapter of the fraternity has
been granted to the school is a sign
that the nation has recognized the
importance of the University and the
scope of its work.

In honor of the new chapter, Sigma
Chi will entertain at -its house on
Belleﬁeld ave., on Monday evening,
November 9.

PANTHERRECEIVES
‘ CONTRIBUTIONS?

The deluge of contributions 3 the
new Panther from the pens of Pitt’s
jokesmiths has been so voluminous
that S. S. Hoehl, the editor‘ of the
publication, has been. unable ‘to ﬁn_d
them with a searchlight and a magni-
fying glass. The co-operation of the
students is necessary in the compila-
tion of the weird and humorous things
that happen on the campus. Make sure
that you get the worth of your ﬁfty
cents by sending in a campus joke or
a humorous article, or a cartoon
exemplifying some event of the term.
Contributions should be handed to Mr.
Hoehl, or to George Ketchum.

CADET CORPS ORGANIZED.

Under the direction of three of last
year’s officers, a successful attempt
has been made to reorganize the
cadet corps which did so much good
work the last two years. Over forty
men were present at the initial meet-
ing last Monday noon. This was one
of the requiriments set by the depart-
ment of Physical Educationpwhen the
project was started this year. Direc-

-v

 

‘ tor Miller placed the matter ‘before the

deans last Wednesday, and ‘they
authorized the ~ organization’ and
agreed to allow gymnasium credit for
this work. Sophomores‘ who have
passed their swimming tests may take
three hours of drill, but freshmen are
required to take one hour of
swimming and the other‘ two in-drill,
if they elect drill in preference to
gymnasium work. Drills will be held
as formerly, in the Eighteenth Regi-
ment armory. Notice-of the first drill
will be placed on the bulletin boards.

Y. W. C. A. MEETING.

The Y. W. C. A. girls heard a very
interesting discussion at the regular
meeting last Monday morning, which
was led by Miss Holliday. Miss Hol-
liday showed the inﬂuence of every
girl in act and deed. Special music
was rendered by a quartette.

The subject next Monday morning

is “The Give and Take College Life.”

G THE TEAM THAT MADE NEVV HAVEN FAMOUS

BRIGHT ounoox
I run CAP Ann sown

That this will be the greatest Cap
and Gown year that the University
has ever experienced, is assured, ac-
cording to one of those high in author-
ity in that organization. Prof. H. B.
Meller, the faculty adviser of the club,
believes that “The Maxixe Girl,” the
club’s play for this year, will have a
week’s run, either in one of the down-
town theaters or in the new Schenley
theater. Prof. Meller is -also of the
opinion that the caliber of the talent
and the merit of the production ep-
titles. the club’ to recognition in
larger‘ cities than the club has been
accustomed to visit.

“I feel conﬁdent,” said the head of
the School of Mines, yesterday, “that
after the turnout of last Monday, the
Cap and Gown club faces a most’
auspicious year. The executive com-
mittee of the club feels, too, that with
the excellent work of Messrs. Reis and
Schnabel have given us in the compo-
sition, the successes of former Cap
and Gown clubs will pale into in§ig-
niﬁcance when compared to this’ sea-
son’s show. I may say personally,
that of all the musical comedies, I
have ever seen, composed by college
students, “The _Maxixe Girl” ranks
among the ﬁnest. This will be a great
Cap and Gown year.”

The ﬁrst call for candidates for
the show took place last Monday even-
ing. The coaches were much encour-
aged with the material, and expressed
great satisfaction for the talent in
hand. They said that the number
which turned out did not meet their
expectations, but that the mere birth
of the 1914-1915 season could not be
expected to produce a club full-grown
in talent and numerical strength.

NOTED ORATOR SPEAKS
ON EUROPEAN CRISIS.

The regular student assembly was
addressed yesterday morning by Doc-
tor Thos. E. Green of Chicago. The
speaker gave a very spirited talk, and
showed a rare knowledge of hﬁ ﬁeld.
He displayed exceptional ability as an
orator. A .- .

Dr. Green said that Europe explod-
ed because Europe was loaded. She
was in arms so rushed to arms when
the opportunity came. The different
nations did not take into consideration
the dreadful debt, famine, and pesti-
lence that would result but rushed
into battle making use of every ounce
of military preparation.

JOURNALIST ADDRESSES
‘MINISTERS’ ASSOCIATION
Referring to a paper read by T.

R. Williams, instructor in the depart-

ment of Journalism, the “United

Presbyterian,” of October. 31, said:

“Mr. T. R. Wiliams, managing‘ editor

of the Pittsburgh Press, read a

masterly paper before the_Ministerial

Association last Monday morning on

“The Editor’s Viewpoint of the Pres-

ent-Day Criticism of the Press.” He

gave a clear statement of the reasons
why so many inaccuracies occur in
the news columns. He noted the
change ~ in the editorial department
since the days of Horace Greeley and
why there was not so much emphasis
laid on editorials as formerly. For
beauty of diction and scholarly pre-
sentation the paper was unexcelled.

Mr. Williams is a regular instructor

in journalism in the University, of

Pittsburgh.”

MENORAH SOCIETY MEETS.
The Menorah society of the Uni-

versity of Pittsburgh will hold a meet-

ing at the Fort Pitt hotel Thursday,
Nov. 12, at 8 P. M. All students .in
the University who are interested in
-the society are urged to be"present at

that time.

PARADE AND BONTEST
FEATURE   BELEBRATIDN

Complete arrangements have been
made for a ig student parade to take
place before the game tomorrow.

The parade will start from New
Grant st. near the Union station at
12:45 ‘sharp. Headed by the student
band of thirty-ﬁve pieces the parade
will march out Fifth ave. to Forbes
ﬁeld. The gates to the student sec-
tion will not be opened until the par-
ade reaches the ﬁeld.

The fact that W. & J . are to parade
at the same time should be an incen-
tive for every student to be present
to make a good showing. Wear arm
bands, or Pitt colors, and Freshmen
wear their regular hats.

All those who own machines are
requested to decoratethem and join
the parade. , . “ '

The Nixon Theater will be the scene
of a rooting contest between Pitt and
W. & J. for the Geo. H. Cohan cup.
There must be a large representation
of students if the cup is to ‘ be held
as a Pitt trophy.

The ‘Cohan cup will be presented to
the cheerleaderof the winning root-
ers by Miss Msrtlia Hedman of the
“Prodigal Husband” Company.’

The J. M. Roberts cup will .b re-
sented to the Captain of the victor-
ious team by Congressman James
Francis Burke. -

The cheering contest will be judged
by the sporting editors of the various
Pittsburgh Papers.

Seat reservations can be made at
the University Bookstore, or at the
Nixon theater box office. '

“MANHOOD’S ELEMENTS”
THEME OF DR. WARD.

“Watch you, stand fast “in faith,
quit you like men, be strong.” Tak-
ing this passage from the Gospel of
St. Paul to the Corinthians, as his
text, Rev. Dr.  Ward, pastor of
St. Peter’s Protestant Episcopal
church, spoke before the members of
the Y. M. C. A. last Monday morn-
ing.

Enumerating the several elements
of manhood, the speaker said in part:

“Reason, will and affection consti-

tute personality and this is man in

God’s sight. The business of man is

. to bring into play the latent powers

of good and reject the evil. What

‘ you do, you become.

“The ﬁrst element of manhood is
the love of truth. We‘ have to search
for truth. This is a rare achievement
but one will always ﬁnd it who search-
es with the right ;motives. Truth
never reveals its beauties until one
ﬁnd it. E '

“The second element of manhood is
righteousness, the fair dealing of man
with man. Without it, no develop-
ment of man along _any pleasing line
can be acomplished. Right should
prevail at all times.

“The third element of manhood is
moral purity. As the World is full
of temptations, purity is necessary to
the highest manliness. Purity is
strength, impurity weakness.

“The fourth and" last element of

manhood is courage. Moral cowards
are in every station of life; but peo-
ple hate them, they have no respect
for them.

“And” so in closing, let me say: to
be a man, be truthful, be rightous, be
pure, and above all, be brave.”

Next Monday morning, C. V. Ree-
der, of the Western Theological Semi-
nary, will address the Y.~M. C. rA."»‘As
yet, he has not announced his 'sub'eci;‘;
butlie will have a. message for those

FORMER PITT PROFESSOR
RECEIVES APPOINTMENT.

Profesor L. H. Harris, formerly As-
sociate Professor of Electrical Engin-
eering at the University has.been ap-
pointed consulting engineer to the
Public Service Commission of Penn-
sylvania. In this position Prof. Har-
ris comes intocontact with all public
service corporations .throughout_ the
state. During the past summer, he
made an extensive preliminary exam-
ination of the larger concerns operat-
ing in the state, the reports of which
are now in the hands of the commis-
sion. Professor Harris in conjunction
with Prof. R. H. Fernald, professor
and head of the Department of Me-
chanical Engineering at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, have just com-
pleted the Commission’s ﬁrst import-
ant publication,‘ a booklet on service
rules and regulations pertaining to
electricity, gas, water and heat.

All the electrical standardizing
work is in charge of Prof. Harris.
The calibration‘ work of all primary
standards will be conducted in the
standardizing “laboratory of the de-
partment of Electrical Engineering
of the University.

H. B. Pratt, former head of the
standardizing laboratory of the Du-
quesne,Light Co., has been retained
by Prof. Harris to take immediate
charge of all standardizing. work.‘

The work of Prof. Harris has al-
ready established a close relation be-
tween the Engineering Department
and the various public service‘ corpor-
ations throughout the state. This ar-
rangement will tend to develop a much
larger ﬁeld for the electrical engineer-

ing graduates of the University, and

exhibits further evidence of the close
cooperation maintained between Pitt
and our state industries.

ELECTION AFFEBTS    
UNIVERSITY GLASSES

Classes on Tuesday morning were

sadly depleted in many cases on ac- .

count of election.

In the professional schools this day A

was a regular holiday and in the Law
school the future politicians started

their career in public life by declar- .

ing Monday a holiday- as well.

Many students who live out" of town
went home to vote while many men
worked on election boards and for the
Tri-State news bur-eau. For these fel-
lows their work meant an all night
vigil and the -result was over—sleep-
ing on Wednesday.

Many others were to be seen at the,
polls working for their favorite can-
didates and the looks seen on their
faces the following day showed wheth-

er or not they were on the winning“

side.

SENATE ANNOUNCES I
FOOTBALL BANQUET.

At the regular meeting of the stud-
ent senate held last Monday morning
in room 107 Thaw hall, it was decided
to hold a student football banquet on
Saturday evening, Dec. 5. 

The plan of the banquet was not
decided upon until the Board of Con-
trol which is the banquet committee,
secures prices from the various hotels.
It is “planned to have a program of

athletic talks, speeches from the mem- _

bers of the football squad, and a big
time in ,general in celebration of Pitt
gridiron victories this season. is '

The senate also went on record as
not favoring the yell which some stud-
ents are using, especially in the ad-
vent of the W. & J. game. That yell
is “What’s” the answer”? The senate
feels that anything conducive to bad
spirit between the student. bodies of
the two institutions should not be
tolerated, and asks every student's
assistance in breaking up the use of
the ungentlemanly epithet.

ADVISORY BOARD MEETING

The regular monthly meeting of the
A(lVlSOI?17 Board on student activities
will be eld Tuesday evening, Nov. 10,
at 8 p. m., in the Chancellor’s oﬂice in
State hall.

This meeting is very important as
managers of the various clubs .will
give reports at that time. Several
musical club dates have been secured
and are up to the board for ratiﬁca-
tion. The board bases its decision
upon the size of the guarantees se-
cured by the club manager. Another
thing to be considered with relation

to the musical club is the scholastic.

standing of some of themembers.
The Panther will receive ﬁnal con-
sideration, and if sufficient funds have
been secured the staff will be author-
ized to publish the comic monthly.

The proper way to root is to follow

ling vile language at random.

An enormous crowd will be present
at tomorrow’s game and Pitt students
should show .what they» are made of.
W. & J. can be outrooted and it be-

exercise is good for everybody, and if

Let us do everything we can to help
on the victory, but let us help in a
clean sportsmanlike way and choke

Answer.”

FOOTBALL BANQUET.

 

. The Senate is again on the job and
promises to act as the student govern-
ing body in. a way that will bring
credit toiit. Its ﬁrst act of merit was
the announcement of a student foot-
ball banquet.

This banquet will give every Uni-
versity student a chance to pay his
respects to the players, and to show
that their work on the gridiron dur-
ing the season was appreciated.

The life of a football man is not
He makes many sacri-
ﬁces, and spends hours -in hard man-
ual labor. The students should ap-
preciate this and the banquet will af-
ford, the opportunity.

_ We cannot all be players, but we

can be admirers and show our spirit,
and we owe to the team our presence
at the banquet on Dec. 5.

THE-CHEMICAL SOCIETY

Pitt has one society that is especi-
ally active,iand which should be given
special recognition. This society com-
monly knownas the chemical society
is made up of students especially
interested in this science and they
have gained much from the weekly
meetings. 7

The organization is .unus;;1ally ac-
tive, and is setting‘ a pace for the
other organizations. It is the only
student chemical organization in the
United States that is able to hold
successful meeting weekly.

The society has become well—known
and the speakers are men who are
vauthoritiesvin their chosen lines. ‘As a
result a large number of men who are
members .of the American Chemical
Society in this district, attend the
meetings regularly. Such. an organi-
zation shows what can be accom-
plished if everyone takes an interest,
and other societies in the University
should wake up and do'likewise. '

ALUMNI AT _
FOOTBALL GAMES.

The remarkable interest shown in
football by the alumni of the Univer-
sity has been evidenced in no uncer-
tain way by the demand for ticket
reservationswhich have come toithe
ofﬁce of the Graduate Manager of
Athletics du 'ng the past two weeks
for the W. & J. game. From all
parts of Western Pennsylvania orders
have been sent in by the “old grads”
of the University. From alumni of
a decade ago and from the more re-
cent graduates these orders have been
received. ' .

The alumni mail order system of
ticket sales was inauguarated some
years ago and has been growing
steadily every year. By this system,
the men who attended the University

‘WERE YOU AT THE
JUNE BANQUET?

If you are a 1914 graduate and at-
tended the~University banquet in June
at the hotel Schenley and if you aren’t
getting the WEEKLY, advise the Gen-
eral Secretary at once. .Some time
ago the Alumni Council voted that all
of the year’s graduates who attended
the Commencement banquet should be
given free membership in the Alumni
asosciation until the following Janu-
ary and receive the WEEKLY free for
this period of time. The idea was to
start the young graduates in the
proper direction, ﬁguring that they
would continue as paid up members
thereafter. .

The General Secretary is meeting
many 1914 men who attended the ban-
quet .last June who state they aren’t
getting the Weekly. If such men will

are given ﬁrst choice of tickets for
the big games of the y r, the sale;
continuing for a week he ore the tick-
ets are put on public sale. With the
increasing demand for tie“
these games and the enormou owds
which are attending, this is quite an
advantage for the “grads.”v

Each September, letters explaining
the mail order system are sent to al-i
unmi,- with blanks enclosed for order-
ing, etc. This season special care-
was taken to cover all the graduates.
although many were missed due to
incomplete records, etc. Alumni are
sure to know all the details of this
feature if they SUBSCRIBE FOR
THE PITT WEEKLY. Membership
in the Alumni association will take
care of this. The weekly contains in-
structions week by week regarding

those who get the paper and read the
Alumni column will know just what
to do. _

The writer realizes’ that the men
who are members of the association
and get the weekly are the “old stand-
bys” who are usually on the mailing
list for all University publications and
notices. This article, therefore, does
not concern them directly. These men
can help, however, by talking up the
Alumni association and the weekly to
those on the outside. If you meet
a Pitt man who says: “I am never
able to ‘get in’ on the Alumni football
sales—I never receive any notices of
the sales, tc.,” just tell him to write
the Genera Secretary for application
card, join the association and get all
the instructions.

is FOOTBALL I -  
WORTH WHILE?

The advantages of athletic sports,
such as football, are often questioned
by educators, the position being taken
by some that athletics take up ‘too
much -of the student’s time, that in
many cases class room work is a min.-
or consideration, etc. We at Pitt are

. ﬁrmly convinced that these claims are

fallacious. ,

Without going further into that
part of the discussion,. we want to
branch off to another point~——-the value
of athletics, notably football, as a
means of cementing the bonds be-
,tween the University and the gradu-
at ‘- No activity has the wonderful
‘in uenceof keeping the “grad” in

football. -
Coming in close contact with the

while undergraduates, almost every
student these days is a real football
fan. The players are all manly fel-
lows that everyone respects.) When he
graduates and takes up his profession,
this interest is kept up. He reads
about the team and the University
in the newspapers daily. He attends
the games———at least one or two of
them every year and joins in the songs
and yells. He-goes around to see the
fraternity bunch after the game. He
makes an inspection of the campus
and notes the improvements. He sees
the old “Profs.” And when "he returns
home, he has a warmer feeling than
ever for the old school. The spirit
of the game gets in everyonesi blood.
It is certainly worth while.

At the W. & J. and State game,

Pitt graduates to the number of per-
haps ﬁve thousand will be in at-
tendance. And they will be stronger
Pitt men as a result,

Fortunate indeed is the University
to have a , Chancellor and Board of
.Trustees that see the advantage of
encouraging such activities. It is
their inﬂuence that has helped more

At the last meeting of Alumni
-Council, it was decided to’. send let-
ters to all 1914 graduates in order to
check up this feature and secure ac-
-curate recordqof-all who attended. The
names of ‘men who were omitted will
then be added to the list.

If yousee a 1914 man who was
overlooked in this ,way, advise him
to write the General Secretary at
once.
