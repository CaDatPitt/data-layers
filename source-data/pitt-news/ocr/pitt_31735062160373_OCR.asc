Proposed Pa. Drug BiII 

BY MARC RUDOLPH
‘A bill demanding harsher penal-
ties -for drug pushers has been
introduced in the Pennsylvania
The bill is similar to

York September 1. _
The new bill, proposed by

‘Senator Rovner (R-Phila.), calls for
‘a mandatory, life sentence for

non-addict pushers over 18. con-

victed of selling two ounces or more »

of narcotics, with a minimum
sentence of not less than 10. years.
For less than two ounces, a 10-20
year sentence is. imposed.

Under a mandatory life sentence
a judge ’must sentence‘ the
defendent to life, but could specify
that he be paroled after serving the
necessary minimum sentence.

Under the present Pa. law, the
judge determines a suitable penal-
ty. ‘

Sen.. Rovner sees a great need
for a mandatory sentence. “Within
the last 30 months in Philadelphia,
428 pushers were" convicted.

Sixty-two percent of them were put-'
on probation or received suspended-

sentences. Now they’re out
pushing again.
“Our bill is fairer than the New
York bill, in that it distinguishes.
between the addicted and the
non-addicted pusher. Also, mari-
juana.does not come under our
bill--it does. in the New York law.
Our bill doesn’t include possession.
We're making the penalties harder
for the non-addict pusher.”
Rovner says there are 31

Hits Non- addict Pushers x

co-sponsors in the Senate--21 votes
are needed-to pass the bill.
A similar bill was introduced to

‘the U.S. Senate by Senators Hubert

Humphrey and Richard Schweiker
June 8. It is currently pending in

the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The Pa. bill is largely a copy of that

bill says_Rovner. ,

The New York: law does not
distinguish between addict and
non-addict pushers. The New York
penalties include: . I
--Mandatory life with possibility of
parole after 15-20 years for sale of
one ounce or possession of two
ounces or more of heroin, cocaine,
morphine, oropium.

--Mandatory life with parole
after six to eight years for sale of
1/8 ounce to one -ounce of major
narcotices; five gr. or more or
amphetamines; ﬁve‘ milligrams or

_ Addressing an audience of about
80, Cottam saidtlie Arabs initiated
the conflict “because they needed
to show the world that they were
serious in their_ attempt to regain
the territory they had lost in 1967.”
He assumes the Arabs want the
land not to extinguish the state of
Israel but rather to restore “the
Arab sense of dignity.” The Arabs
want to change their image as “bad
fighters," Cottam said and added
their strong showing in the present
war has erased that image.
Going back to 1948 and the
original creation of theslsraeli state,
Cottam said to. understand the war
“one must understand the agony of
the two peoples." He said the
Arabs realized the persecution of
the Jews by the Western ‘world

Arabs should pay the price for

Thursday between Secretary Henry

dor Anatoly F. Dobrynin.

U.S. officials said Washington
and Moscow have not narrowed
their differences to the point where
the two countries were considering
a specific proposal to be put before
the U.N. Security Council. '

These ofﬁcials said Israel’s Arab
foes evidently have reached a
uniform position regarding a
negotiated settlement. But an
Arab source at the United Nations
in New York said. Nixon and
Kissinger left the impression with
Arab diplomats with whom they
"talked Wednesday that the ‘United
States would delay a Middle.East
peace move until it built up Israel’s
military strength. The source said
he expected this resupply process
to take at least two weeks.

studied reports from American“
representatives in Israel and Egypt

In a speech at Pitt Tuesday,
Nakrin, a Jew himself, critized
Israel for “desiring a new war to
expand her territories.” He
ridiculed Zionism for “offering to
help imperialists in return for
support of the Jewish state,”
opposed "the widely held view that
Israel has a right to exist.

“A state does not have the right to
oppress other nations,” Nakrin
said, “and the basis of the Jewish
state of Israel is to drive out and
oppress the Palestinian Arabs who
livethereu I consider Israel proper
occupied territory also.”

Recounting the history of Zion-
ism, Nakrin explained it is based 'on

V the assumption that anti-semitism
' is inevitable. “With this thought,

Zionists forceably kicked the
Palestinians in 1948 in order to gain
V control of that area.”
Paul-LeBlanc, Socialist Workers

cartons in the Towers cafeteria.

Posvar said at the meeting
Wednesday, “The commitment
was broken through sloppy admin-
istrative procedures.”

The _University has drawn up a

written statement‘ to prevent

misunderstandingsin the future.

“The Farmworker’s supporters.

are very overjoyed (about the
University’s statement),” said
Grace Cisneros, coordinator of the
Pittsburgh boycott for the UFW.
Cisneros thought there had been
plenty of misunderstanding on both

sides, but the fact it is cleared up is

a good sign.

“For a while we thought we were ’

getting the runaround from the
University, but having this meeting

solved it,” she explained. “I hope \

we don't have any more broken
promises with Pitt.”

After hearing of the written
statement that ldid not include a
policy on grapes, Cisneros said,
“We’ll have to get something

about getting the grapes in there. —

If the people are going to support
us in the lettuce boycott, they
should be able to support the grape
boycott too.”

The meeting Wednesday was
attended by 50 to 60 people,
including the Pitt United Farm-
workers Support Committee.

Academic Freedom Issue in   Jensen   Debate     

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
Jensenism, the theory that
blacks are inferior to whites, was

the subject of a debate yesterday-

between Professor Robert Perloff

Professor Robert Perloff
' phto by Wilson

and Professor Erwin Schulman.

Both Perloff and Schulman have’

been involved in the University
debate on the matter of Jensenism.’

Jensenism, a theorgy proposed
by‘ Arthur Jensen, psychologist,
claims that blacks are genetically
less intelligent than whites. The
theory is based on a series of hotly
debated tests and studies.

The argument, as indicated by
Schulman, was the issue of

academic freedom in reference to,

the Jensen debate. “The issue,"
Schulman said, “is that whether
Jensen is right or wrong should be
decided by people who understand
the ﬁeld...not by faculty senates.”
Schulman referred to the petition
raised by Students for Democatic
Society (SDS) at the meeting of the
Faculty Senate last term. At the
meeting, a motion to condemn
Jensenism was tabled by
Faculty Senate. _

Senate,” said Perloff. He
expressed relief that the issue was
tabled because of its sensitive
ramifications. “I was afraid that if
the resolution did notgpass, it would
put the Faculty Senate on record as

Both professors noted the danger
of setting precedents for supres-
sion of research in universities.
Politically-oriented action or
censorship would disrupt, Perloff
noted, “The view of the university
as center for the unfettered pursuit
of truth.” ‘

The credence Jensenism could

the debate. Both debaters saw this

Slithering like a cobra through the underbrush of American society
is a book that no establishment or even “underground" publisher or

reviewer will touch.

It ignites an auto-da-té under the Torquemadas ofthe |iberal—minor-
ity inquisition, while showing up modern conservatives as the worst
enemies of conservatism. it makes everybody look bad except the “bad
guys"—the Wasps and other Majority members who have been on the
wrong end of the intellectual slugfest for these manyyears.

lmaglne, if you can, a scholarly work that takes the Majority side
in the great ethnic debate, that discusses the unassimilable minorities
objectively, that goes into such forbidden subjects as the biology of
revolution, that finds the chief cause of America's decline to be genetic.

Social science teachers don't answer the book. They just start

screaming. ~

Why not order this time bomb and start it ticking under the desks of
the liberal fantasts, Freudian trumps, conservative psychos, and Marxist
and Marcusian madhatters that infest your classrooms?

You'll scare the dogma out of them.

You'll also undogmatize yourself, and acquire a new sense of pur-
pose, as you suddenly see your country, your history and your people in

a totally new light.

;t Dear Sir:
"‘ _The Oakland Chapter ~- of the
National Organization for -Women
‘ysupports Kathleen Gentilcore in
égheri suit against the University. We
believe that:
 Theiback pay due Ms. Gentilcore
._fs_lio'uld be paid for the period from
-June 1 to the present, rather than
from June 1 to September 1 as the
University proposes, because the
discrimination against her‘ did not
 stop when the man who previously
 filled the position resigned.
:. The evening positions of Library
{Assistant I that Ms. Gentilcore has
named in her suit should not be
_’ downgraded, but rather the day
,position should be upgraded. This
‘jfis a fairer solution since it will
“beneﬁt all ‘present and future
-”holders of the job.
As. an effort in concilliation, the
I formerly‘ denied job has been
_ offered to Ms. Gentilcore.
‘ However, it seems that this is more
A-. of a favor_to her than as a positive

‘against women in the University.
This‘ position should always be
‘open to women, rather than as a
gone-time, favor to an aggrieved
"party- ,

, Finally, we believe the University
"should acknowledge its guilt in the

 points of reconcilliation drawn up
 O by the Equal Employment Oppor-

 V.-‘Dear Editor: J
4' The October 15 NEWS carried an
 article about my Winter Term
 course’ in parapsychology‘ that
somehow missed telling what was
if  to bejin the course and how to
 "enroll." May I supply that
 I’ information since the course is not
 i 4 in the Catalogue or Time Schedule?

 
  
  

  

 

’ Course CAS-42 (one credit,
 -Tuesday, 10 a.m.) will be a series
1 "I" I, ._ of original lectures plus required
” outside reading that will cover the
-— ‘V ' entire field of scientiﬁc para-
 ‘psychology. It will include such

“ -topics as: spiritualist mediumship,

7‘ shock avoidance by caged rodents,
- spontaneous psychic phenomena,
 multiple personality, beating an
K‘  "electronic: roulette wheel, and

3 , “mind over matter.” The main
I  questions to which we shall be

seeking answers are: How . much

‘ The treatment will be non-

Timed Tests

Dear Pitt News.

Timed tests really shit!

I'm a freshman and I.noticed just
recently that every damn test is
timed. Even quizzes. I’ve gone up
to every /teacher that gives these
timed tests, I’ve told them that

these types of tests were no good.

The reasons for my anger are
many, but. all hinging from the
basic fact that grades are important
for myfuture.

Just because a student can read
faster, write faster, work a ‘slide
rule better, and remember quicker,
doesn’t mean he should get a
better grade
Chemistry. As the final result is
that ‘he is getting graded on just

technical advancement in regur-. - -
gitating-information. If a person ’

can think out a problem and finally
answer it correctly, well, this
seems to be the whole point of it.
Thinking requires time and when
time is cut short, the thinker is at a
loss. ' _‘
These time limited tests also
cause anxiety and unnecessary
frustration, Many times I will be
going along smoothly on a test and
then I realize that I have to move
quickly, for time is of the essence.
I worry and my mindis taken off
the test and instead channeled

‘towards worrying about ﬁnishing.

This is unfair and it can get me sick
besi_des. V . .
My conclusion is that fairness in

r‘ testing should not be sacrificed for

convenience. I realize that in a
university of this size that letting
each individual student work until
he is done would be impractical,
but the way it is now is terribly

I wrong, except if timed tests are

ruled out as grading tools and
instead are just used as tests to
show the student how fast he is
working.

I can't begin .to tell ‘you how»

pissed-off and upset and mad and
angry and frustrated, etc., I am.
Testing should be revised and if
there is anyone out there that has
an idea on how to revise the testing
system here at Pitt,‘ please contact
me and I will work with you to offer
up a proposal to the Dean or
someone. \

Thank you,

  Guilt for War Rests with Israel

BY BILL WADDEL, YSA

“The responsibility for the
current war in the Middle ‘East
rests squarely on the Israeli
government. Zionist accusations
that Egypt, Syria and the other
Arab nations are_at fault smack of
the same kind of racist hypocrisy
that would blame the American
Indians for the white man’s
genocidal wars against them‘.

“Israel is a colonial-set_tler state
which has ruthlessly carved a niche
for itself in the Middle East by
stealing Arab lands and trampling
upon the rights of the Arab. people.

dissent within Israel. outrageous
actions such as the assassination of
Palestinian resistance leaders by
Israeli commandos in Lebanon last
April and the shooting down of a
Libyan passenger airliner by
Israelis in February--all give lie to
the myth that Israel is a ‘peaceful,
democratic’ state.

“The real aims of the Israeli

‘ capitalists have become increasing-

ly clear since the 1967 war in which
Israel seized control of the Sinai
Peninsula, the Golan Heights and
the West Bank of, Jordan. “Israel
has since belligerently refused to
return these Arab lands and has, in
fact, firmly planted thousands of
Israeli colonizersi in them. _ Since
the new war began, Israeli officials
have threatened to steal even more
land from the Arab people.

“-The United-States government
has Israel to the teeth and helped to
finance its expansionist policies in
order to assure the continued
existence of a, guardian of the
capitalist order in the Middle East. '

Greensburg would not have consti-
tuted ,“help” on my part.

I’m sure I wouldn’t have offered‘

any relief to the young beggar by
lecturing him in the fine art of fiscal
responsibility. ‘Besides not even
stopping long enough to hear his
whole sob story, I ‘sincerely
doubted I could have discouraged
him fromcoming to the Big City on
inadequate funds.

In fact, telling him the timetable
for Lincoln Coach service to
Greensburg would not have been
help. So I left the boy to wander
about Oakland, longing to again
see his homeland on Route 30 East.

Heart-rending.

The bum probably had never seen
Greensburg.

Alternatively, the beggars request
or offer services that aren’t-
normally requested or offered on
street comers. I heard of one

‘fellow who was approached on

Downtown’s Liberty Avenue by a
man with a really good deal .on a
diamond ring. Ka’1ppel’s, take note.

same as those used by the U.S.
against the Vietnamese, people.

And Israel is using them’ for the
same reason--to deny an oppressed
people the right to control their
own lands and determine their own
destiny. Just as the existence of
the racist state of South Africa is
based ~on the oppression and
exploitation of millions of native
Africans, the continued existence 0

the state of Israel is completely 

incompatible with the rights and
desires of millions of Palestinians
and other Arabs. I

“The Young‘ Socialist Alliance
calls on all those who desire peace
in the Middle East to support the
just struggle of the Palestinians
and other Arab peoples for
self-determination and national

Arab countries in their fight

A person can always try avoiding

When you’re a Pitt student at the

in porno ﬂicks or army surplus, '

you’ll find it hard to steer clear ,of

around downtown. Some of your
best bargains are to be found, quite
literally, on Liberty Avenue.

The social issues involved in
panhandling could keep .a con-

cerned citizen busy for the rest of

his humanitarian life. But since
I'm not out to clean up society, my
problem is simply one of learning
how to deal with the beggar next
time I come upon one. _

Maybe I'll hand him a bus

more of LSD; for possession of 1-2

ounces of major narcotics; ten gr.

or greater of amphetamines or 25
milligrams of LSD.

The bill was initiated by New
York Governor Nelson Rockefeller.

‘According to the New York Times,

Rockefeller said “We have spent
almost a billion dollars in this "state
on treatment in the last 10- years.
We have tried every_ kind. of
treatment and about 80% of those
who are treated go back.”

The New York law has come
under harsh criticism. In a letter of ‘
the New York Times September 8,,
New York State Supreme Court
Justice James J. Leff described the
law as the “latest exercise in
barbarism."

“The Judicial system is being
debased,” wrote ‘Leff. “The courts
are being told that.they have been
given the power to ‘do their job,
and that it will be their responsi-
bility if they fail’.”

The law also limits plea
bargaining to cases where the
pleader will assist in other drug
prosecutions. '

Under the New York law, a
housewife found guilty of possess-
ion of two ounces of heroin would
receive a mandatory life sentence

' with possibility of parole only after
'15-25 years.

The judge cannot
make the sentence lighter.

More jury trials for drug cases
are predicted due to the harshness
of penalties. According to the New
York Times New York City will
need 158 new courts to handle the
increased loads. Each new court
will cost $600,000 Archibald
Murray, Commissioner of the (New
York) State Division of Criminal
Justice. ' . . _ .

The __ New York. - law has ._ been
criticized by Pennsylvania V con-

gressmen considering the Pe_nnsyl- .

vania bill. Representative [Joseph

V. Zord ]r., chairman of the House --

Committee, on ‘Justice and

In the Pennsylvania Senate, the
bill is in the Public Health and
Welfare Committee. Senator Louis
Coppersmith, chairman, has his
doubts as to when the bill will reach
the_Senate floor.

“I don’t know if it will get out of
committee," says Coppersmith.
“The serious question I ask is ‘are
mandatory sentences constitu-
tional?’ My lawyers are working to‘

decide if it is.

“We had a mandatory law on
marijuana a few years ago and it
was declared_ unconstitutional. If
this is constitutionaland. the New
York law is working then we can
see what to do about it.”

Money will be needed to increase
the number ‘of courts in New York,
but Rovner, does not see the
problem occurring in Pennsylvania.
“We’ve established 52 more courts
from a bill last year that I
introduced,” he said. “I think the
need for 158 new courtsjin New
York City is an exaggeration.”

Israel understood the Arab
anger, stated Cottam, but felt the’
necessity of a “haven for Jews, a
homeland.” He spoke of the
“profound isolation of the Jews,...
underlined by Hitler, but several
centuries deep.”  I

In order to assure their security,‘

Cottam alleged Israel had “to
communicate to the Arabs that the
price of Israel's defeat was greater
than the Arabs ‘could pay.” -He
said the Middle East clashes of ’56

and '67 attempted to prove this 4

point.

_ Returning to the present strife,
Cottam does not think the Russian
and U.S. airlifts are necessarily
bad. He said Russian aid to the
Arabs is good “if only used to
prevent humiliation” from a
devastating defeat.

U.S. aid to Israel is also good he
said. “if not used to humiliate

 

Arabs butito attack Israel’s belief of
their isolation. The airlift is an
indication that the peoples of the
Western world do care for them.”

Cottam does not believe that the,
,,State Department ‘sponsored; the

airlifts» to reduce Israel’s isola-
tionist ideas“: He accused Secretary

of State Henry Kissinger of doing it

through a ‘ipavlovian sense of Cold
War stimuli. The Russians do it so
we do it.” This kind of reasoning
could lead I to 'a confrontation
between the major powers Cottam
aﬂeged.

Commenting on the continual

breakdown of direct negotiations.

between Israel and the Arab states,

Cottam said neither side wanted to

sit.at the peace table as the

"‘vanquished to the victor.”

_. Reiterating his position that the
Arab. nations want only a restored
sense of dignity, Cottam’ outlined
his program for peace in the
Middle East. First, hesuggested

Second, he advocated a Palest

recognized the difficulty of .ﬁnding
a lpcation for such a state.  
Cottam said that it is irnperativ,

believes it is in the interest of the
United States to play such _a role.

The United States needs oil and

Middle East, Dr. Cottam said. He
felt the inﬂuence of the ‘Jewish
vote’ should. also sway 
politicians to backlsrael. , I  ,

the “talking typewriter."

The Moore-Kobler “Talking
Typewriter” is a $50,000 computer,
run typewriter, which ‘helps make
the process of learning to read,
both English -. and foreign langu-

' ages, much more efficient. When a

key on the “Talking Typewriter” is
depressed, the machine pronoun-
ces the sound phonetically, by the
use of speakers. Also, a picture of
the letter pronounced is ﬂashed on

. a screen. The student not only sees

what letter he has produced, but
also hears it almost instantaneously
after he depresses the key.

The “Talking Typewriter" is one
of the products of a 20 year
research development, which is in
its 12th year. called the Clarifying
Environments Program, of which
Dr. ‘Moore is the head of reseach.

There are 55 centers all over the

hospitals. in which the typewriter is
used to aid in the teaching process
of the emotionally disturbed and
mentally retarded. Dr. Moore
explained its use in the instruction
of the emotionally disturbed.

“Some severely emotionally dis-
turbed children" cannot relate to
’ humans. so_they relate to the
Talking Typewriter. and slowly
‘they begin to relate to a human
teacherf'

   

.VVith normal children the “Talk-

ing Typewriter." along with the
“Talking Page." another Moore
invention, can teach the child in
first grade to read on a fifth grade
level.

-The “Talking Typewriter” is
merely a tool, which if used by
trained personnel, can be very
useful in the field of education. Dr.
Moore explained, “Most people
know me for my ‘Talking
Typewriter,’ but hat is only a
small part of my program. The
‘Talking Typewriter,’ like any

' other piece of technical equipment,

if used by trained personnel can
prove very useful, but in the hands
of non-trained operators, can b
totally useless.” '
Dr. Moore is very concerned

"about the lack of proper education

in the Black Ghetto. “The Ghetto
schools in the inner-city -are
approximately four years behind
the college-bound high school in
suburbia." ' . ‘

Dr. Moore, along with a number
of associates, has put his training

_they

and inventions to good use by
setting up a five year educational

laboratory program, under contract -

with The Pittsburgh Model Cities
Agency, at ' Letsche Elementary
School in Pittsburgh’s Hill District,
which was torn by riots a few years
ago.

At Letsche. Dr. Moore trained
local paraprofessionals to operate
the education lab. By using local
people in the labs. the children
were familiar with the people that
interacted with in this
program. Many of the childrens’
reading abilities were brought up
to. or exceeded standard levels.

They also taught Black History._

and other culturally relevant
courses. to these black. children.
The children learned to operate
desk top computers. and acquired
skills unheard of in other public
schools. Before the program at
Letsche was barely running
smoothly. the five year contract
expired. V

As a result of this program at
Letsche. Dr. Moore edited a film

entitled “Black Excellence." which I

illustrated-how black children from
the deprived ghetto can learn. ' It
shows the children learning in the
lab. and using the equipment.

Last Saturday night- the Music
Department presented a concert of
viola music performed by Jerry
Horner, principal violist with the
Pittsburgh Symphony and Marvin
Tartak, his accompanist who is a
professor of musicology at the
University. Jerry» Homer, began
playing with the Symphony just
this September, and this concert
was the first opportunity for many
to hear him perform.

The viola is not the most common
instrument to hear in this type of
concert. The solo repertoire is

quite small. probably because its-

soft. mellow tone can be so easily
lost in the fuller sonorities of the
piano and other chamber instru-
ments. Unlike the violin and cello.
the sound of this “middle-range"
instrument doessuch a successful
job of blending that it never
received the “soloistic" attention
that has been ‘given to other
orchestral instruments.

The_ concert suffered in two ways
from this problem. First of all, of

the four pieces presented on the‘

program, two were not originally
written for’ the viola: a Bach Sonata
for Viola da Gamba and Continuo,
and the Brahms Sonata in'E-flat
Major, op. 120, written for clarinet
and piano.

place on a warm September night
before the two can leave for school.
The film is an honest, humanly
humorous look at that night in
1962, with all the madness of an
era. Le Mat. while trying to pick up
girls, is stuck'with a 13-year old
chick -looking for the excitement

' A football team isjgoing to be brought back down, to earth tomorrow.

 

llllllllllllllllllllIIIIIllIllllllllllllllllllllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE

Which team it will be won’t be determined until the game at Chestnut _

Hill, Mass. comes to an end. p « 1,
I strongly believe that it will be the Boston_ College .Eagles. They
have been talking more than the Panthers have. A recent Boston paper

' quoted several BC players as saying that the Eagles will not lose a

game the rest of the year.— - V ,
The performance of the team to date is not indicative of a squad that

can win six games in a row, even if the opponents include" Villanova, J

Massachusetts, and Holy Cross.

Boston College coach Joe Yukica summed up his teams efforts when
he said, “A good team scores when it is inside the Eve yard-line.”.
Boston College is not a good team by his definition.

Unlike the Johnny Majors “Children Crusade,” BC’s major strength
is its experience. The mistakes that cost Boston College the Miami
game can not be -blamedon youth. Failing to score on two different
‘drives inside the five yard-line is themark of a team that chokes.

Of course the Boston College people .don’t call it choking. They call
it almost pulling off upsets. You can bet that if a Pitt team that is not
full of freshman like this year’s is were to lose a game the way BC lost
to Miami, Johnny Majors would“ be plenty mad.

This will be the first day game that Boston College will be playing,
having played all five of its previous games under lights. _Since Pitt has

played all of its games in the day, this will ‘bean advantage for the

Panthers._ . . .

Boston College is quite proud of its fourth quarter scoring ability.‘
They have netted 56 points in the ﬁnal stanza, while holding its
opponents to 16. Since the~Cats pride themselves on their fourth
quarterplay, the game should offer 60 minutes of exciting football."

Pitt is rated a seven point underdog for the clash; ' The
ever-improving Panthers put together their ﬁrst complete game
against West Virginia, and as the young Panthers mature, their
performances should improve from. week to week.

Pitt is undefeated on the road and winless at home. Hopefully, this
trend will continue for just one more week," as the Cats play three
games in a row at Pitt Stadium beginning next Saturday.

I None of the Pitt regular players will miss the trip, but a handful will

be playing below 100% . “There are some players that we ‘hoped would r

be healthier than they are,” said defensive coordinator Jackie Sherrill.

The starting Tulane and West Virginia quarterbacks watched the
end of the games from the sidelines, and the Cats have been rated the
most physical team that each opponent has faced.

Any team that beats Pitt from here on will need to have some depth.
Boston College has not played a really physical team yet, and this could
be a factor tomorrow. ' - »

ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR.
Even though coach Johnny

Majors has stated time and time
again that a single game doesn’t
make a season, the emphasis of
tomorrow's tilt with Boston College
in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts
has indicated that this will be the
most important contest for the
Panthers so far.

“Which ever team wins this
ball game can easily go on «and have
a’ successful season,” Majors
commented. “Theother will have
to fight back to remain respect-
able." ' A

The game has also developed
into a test to see who the most
improved team in the East is. Last
year, the Eagles were the only

. victims of Pitt but this season is a

completely different story in
Boston. My
“Boston College is a good
looking football team,” Majors said
after viewing films of the Eagles.
“We’ll be playing a team that is

‘J the best. executing and best
blocking team th_at we have "faced.

so far this year.” M _ ’

Boston College will carry a
record of 3-2 into the clash but
those two loses were byuless than a

. touchdown each and came at the

hands of some worthy opponents.
The Eagles went down to'Tulane,
21-16, at New. Orleans.
coach Bob Leahy, who scouted the
game for Majors, stated that the
Eagles did not look up to par.

Undefeated Tulane is ranked 17 in
the nation. '

The Eagles reportedly gave
Miami (Fla.) their victory last
week. Boston College failed to

move the ball in from inside. the
Miami five yard line and actually
lost the game in the ﬁnaliquarter.
Miami is ranked 15 nationally.
“Boston College could very well
be undefeated right now, except for
a few breaks here and there,”
Majors remarked. “They played

Charles ‘Buzz’ Ridl rang the bell
on the 1973 edition of the Pitt

House. Ridl called together his 10

what promises to be a tough

name associated with hockey in the
Hub, .but on the- Boston College

Esposito has been tabbed as one of

“Their-offensive running game ' 

compares favorably with Baylor, a
team that ran the ball down our
throats some three weeks ago,”
Majors claims. “Esposito is a ﬁne

that can ‘take him to the outside.”

experimenting in the centerislot

Mickey Martin and newcomer
Lou Hill will team with Knight to
give the Cats strength and depth at

averaged 12.5 points in '72 and Hill
averaged 15 points at Ferrum Jr.

Ridl seems to have a lot of depth

Pitt'sjunior varsity football team
will travel to Ambridge. Pa. to

.' encounter what can be considered

the biggest team the Panther Cubs

 will face this year, when they take
 the field tomorrow against the
_ West Virginia junior varsity.

The Cubs will be traveling light
and not because of injuries, but

, . rather by virtue of the fact that

approximately eight of Coach Bob
_-Leahy's charges will travel .to

~ -Boston with the Varsity.

Leahy has worked diligently
repairing and preparing his squad

‘ , forthe West Virginians who in his

words “Throw well, run well, and
hit well." Anyone who was in
Morgantown last Saturday knows

. ,that these people are quite anxious

_to mix it with anything that
domiciles in Pittsburgh.

' The Cubs are facing an offense
that rolled up 47 points against
Fairmont State JVs and Little
Mountaineer coach Jim Young-

“blood would like to keep that.

momentum after their first three

 ‘ games. Coach Leahy’s 5-2 defense

"I

 "has allowed three T.D.’s thus far

and need to maintain this stature
against the balanced attack of the
Mountaineers.

We should see Dave Migliore
starting at quarterback rotating
with Pat Carey. “Dave has been
showing some promise and we're
anxious to see how he'll react to a
starting assignment- We haven’t
had a frosh quarterback who can
run the option and stop and throw
the baIl."\-conceded the Cub
mentor. ' V

Last week the Cub punting game
could muster just 25 yards per
attempt. It will be Michael Curley
doing the punting chores again this
week. “I have conﬁdence that
Mike can do the job for us,” said
Leahy. The kicking game must be
up to par to avoid giving away field
position to the offensive minded
West Virginians.

Unlike last week,’ the Cubs must i

hit and hit hard to move a club that

outsizes Pitt's Varsity. It seems'of _

paramount importance for the
junior Panthers to avoid turning the
ball over to the opposition as did
happen in last Saturday's defeat at
the hands of Kent State junior

On Wednesday night, a powerful

showed poise and confidence
throughout the game and slowly
ground their opponent down.
' Piso wasted no time in scoring in
the game. with approximately 3
minutes gone‘in the first half they
put together a fine power play to
drive home the first point. After a
few exchanges at midﬁeld Piso
came right back for two more quick
goals and ended the half leading

slightly when I overheard Alpha
Epsilon's goalie say, “What am I
doing out here?" and he couldn't
think of an answer.

Piso scored their fifth goal as the
ball skidded right through the
goalie's hands. Although they
never gave up, Alpha Epsilon,
looking tired and cold afterjbeing

Whenever knowledgable athele-
tic critics discuss what is happen-
ing in collegiate ‘tract, the
University of Pittsburgh is one of
few names that holds attention.
The main factor in Pitt's highly
successful track program is a four
lettered one: WORK‘.

In a highly technological society ,

where man continually seeks to
reduce this concept; there are
/people who will take work head on
and beat it to death: such is
Nickolas Martin of both the cross
country team and track team at the
University of Pittsburgh.

Nick became interested in
running while attending Carrick
High School, located in nearby
South Hills. At Carrick, track
coach Bill Cooper worked with and
secured him an engagement in the
State Track and Field Champion-
ships where Nick just missed being
the state's class “A” mile champ
by one tenth of a second.

“Nick is pretty much a self made
athelete,” commented Coach

 — Cooper. “By winning the city cross

country championship three times
plus being the city’s mile champion
for as many years,,and half mile

_ champ his last two years, Nick can

be thought of as Pittsburgh’s most

“dominant distance runner. Then as

now, Nick continues to help our
runners here at Carrick on a
personal basis.”

As a freshman at Pitt, Nick

suffered a freak leg injury that cost ,
V him three weeks of valuable

training time last January at the
start of the indoor track season. “It
was at this time that former Pitt
All-American Jerry Richey helped
me immensely,” related the poised
sophmore.

“After the injury I came back
running, but my confidence was
gone. Jerry talked with me for
several hours just on what" it takes
to get back my confidence. He
stressed consistency, with the idea

"that good preparation is 90% of a

race.

Now when I enter races 1. don’t
think twice of whether I’m ready to
go. Being only human its
inevitable that a bad race will come
my way. But with good preparation
those occurences will be cut to a
minimum. Jerry’s a fantastic
person, I love the guy; he didn’t
leave me when I was down.”

Presently, Nick’s performance
with the cross country team has
been impressive. Last Friday, He
led his fellow harriers to victory
over West Virginia University
despite developing a stomach
cramp half-way through_ the six
mile course he finished in a time of
32 minutes and 2 seconds.

“Pain is one thing I’ve met in
practice as well as in competition.
Each time it happens, like in the
West Virginia meet, it does a lot for
my confidence” admitted Nick.
“No runner can afford to worry
himself about pain. Nick is a

‘fabulous competitor,” claims Pitt

- Harriermartin Takes

head track ‘mentor, “He’s a hard
worker and fights off challengers.
He's our distance star of the
future.” . ‘

When questioned about how he
felt concerning working with
Banner, who has produced many_
All-Americans, Nick replied,
“Coach Banner is excellent on
techniques. He knows exactly.
where we should be in our training
program. I ‘believe in Coach
Banner like the football team
believes in Johnny Majors. Right ‘
now, I wouldn’t trust any other
coach to work with me.” '
