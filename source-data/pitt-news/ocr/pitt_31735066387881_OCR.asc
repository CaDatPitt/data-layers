Lawhead blasts SGB
for lack of ambition

By Brendan Kevenides

Staff Writer

As Pitt’s Student Government
Board reconvenes for the new
term, the frustration of getting
the ball rolling again has become
apparent.

At its first meeting of the term

.st Wednesday, Board member
Justin Lawhead let his frustration
show with harsh words for
returning colleagues.

“When I was first elected to this
position, I was told that this Board
was the most ambitious in recent
times. I haven’t been able to find
any board members that merit
this description,” he said at the
meeting.

Lawhead explained after his

 speech that although his words

may have seemed harsh, he did
not mean to offend anyone, nor
was he directing his comments
toward any board members. in
particular.

“I just wanted to fire people up
and get them to realize that we
have a lot to do over the next
three months [when the present
Board’s term endsl,” he said.

Board member Julie Shepard

explained what she thought was
the reason for Lawhead’s concern.
With many members away for
the summer, “he and I carried
most of the weight this summer.
A lot of little things kept us
constantly busy,” she said.
A By the end of August, she and
Lawhead were into the full swing
of SGB business while many
others were just beginning to re-
establish thernselves. “

“We were already doing things
while everyone else was just
starting up,” Shepard said.

Lawhead explained that these
two opposing forces frustrated

 Although all the rosters are not
yet, it appears that this
emester’s rush may be one of
he most successful that Pitt has
een in recent years, according to
im Venturella, president of the
nterfraternity Council.

Q “It’s going to be the greatest

rush we ever had, but not by
great numbers,” said Venturella.
“It seems that the fraternities did
better than they ever did lbeforel.”

him and compelled him to
prepare the speech. .

In the speech, Lawhead
commented, “This Board has
fallen by the wayside in terms of
responsibility and respect for
position. Our commitment to
ideals has to be shown.”

He explained that his concern
for the Board’s well—being
outweighed his apprehension
about airing his anxiety publicly.

“I debated about giving the
speech, but I was concerned that
the Board was faltering,” Lawhead
said. “By faltering, I mean that
we’re not realizing that we’ll be
out of here in three months.”

Shepard reiterated, “I agreed

. with Justin that we needed to get

ourselves in gear. We have a big
responsibility.”

Reactions to Lawhead’s
statements by other members of
the Board were -generally
receptive. _

SGB President Kent Bauldauf
said, “Traditionally, getting back
into the swing of things is tough.
Justin was just forewarning the
board and reminding us of what
we have to do.”

Board member Anastasia
Kawalic said that although she
appreciated Lawhead’s
statements, she wishes that he
had spoken to the Board in private
first. And Robin Dion commented
that she did not feel Lawhead
was acting out of line but was just
acting concerned.

According to Shepard, business
at the SGB is getting back to
normal this week. She also said
that there are a lot more people
in their offices this week “although
that could be attributed to a lot of
things,” she added.

Sigma Chi and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon have all increased the
number of pledges they received
from the last term, according to
representatives of the fraternities.

Kenneth Bonner, president of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity,
said this rush period brought his
house the largest pledge class in
at least six years.

“We weren’t really concerned
with the numbers,” he said. “It
just happen to turn out that we
did very well. I

“From what I understand by
talking with brothers from other
houses, we’re in the upper half,
and maybe in the top five in the

size of our new pledge class.”
Bonner said it’s not the number
of pledges a house gets, but the
character quality of the pledges
that really matters. But numbers,
he adds, are nice to have.
Unlike Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
other fraternity representatives
indicated that their houses saw a
decrease or no noticeable change
in the number of pledges. These
include Phi Delta Theta, Phi
Gamma Theta, Triangle, Theta
Chi, Pi Kappa Alpha and Phi
Kappa Theta. Jerry O’Rourke,
Internal Vice President of IFC,
listed a probable cause of the
decrease as “Normally a large

percentage of guys who register
for rush end up pledging next
term because. of grades and
financial stability.”

The sororities, however, have
not yet completed their rush
events and are holding an
informal rush at this time. Debby
Staudt, president of Sigma Delta
Tau, explained, “We’ll be done
rushing in a couple of weeks or
less.”

The rush period has been
extended because only seven
houses were able to meet their
quotas. According to Tracy Susan,
rush chairman for Alpha Delta Pi,
many sororities failed to meet

iiiraternities count pledges as rushing comes to an end

this number because
approximately one hundred girls
dropped out of rush, and some of
the sororities feel that the quota is
set too early in the rush events.

In response to this argument,
Bridget S.’ Guernsey the Greek
Advisor, commented, “We do it
the way the National Panhellenic
Conference has it written in their
policies.”

Despite the difficulties faced
by some of the houses, still others
were able to meet or exceed their
quotas. These include Chi Omega,
Delta Zeta, Alpha Epsilon Pi,
Kappa Kappa Gamma and Kappa
Alpha Theta.

THE PI'IT NEWS, Tuesday, September 19, 1989 3

By Laurie Lehosky
Staff Writer

Standing on the corner of
Forbes Avenue and Bouquet
Street, its neon signs light up the
Oakland night. Perhaps it is the
smell from inside that draws large
crowds in front. It’s a Pitt original.
It’s The Original Hot Dog Shop.

Being a fast food stop, the “O,”
as it is known to Panther veterans,
sells a variety of foods, such as
hot dogs, hamburgers, subs and
pizza. However, it is for the french
fries that the restaurant is most
well known.

“We use 30,000 pounds of
potatoes weekly, and each week
a trailer directly from Idaho
delivers our potatoes; so you
know they are fresh,” says
Manager Ron Kosko. He added
that as many as 2,000 hot dogs
are sold per day.

“Our food speaks for itself. We
use only the best quality foods
such as Heinz Ketchup, Kraft
Cheese Whiz and Kraft Gravy,”
he adds. .

Another product that is used in
cooking the fries is Kraft Peanut
Oil. It has a zero percentage in
cholesterol, which Kosko says is

7709 Original Hot Dog Sloop

indicative that the products used
at the “O” are top quality.

New to the “O” is pizza, which
can be bought by the slice or by
the pie. Catfish products are also
a new choice sold in fillets, strips
and Cajun sea nuggets.

“During the day it is more cut-
and-dried, with customers ranging
from Pitt students to employees
and hospital workers,” said
Kosko. The busiest night at the
“O” is Friday, with the rush at 2
a.m.

“Fries are the biggest with
college students,” Kosko said.

The “O” also features movie
nights, which will be on Tuesday
and Wednesday evenings at the
Top of the “O.” On movie nights,
three related films are shown on
the big—screen television. Kosko
says previous movie nights
included comedy, Mel Gibson
and Alfred Hitchcock nights.

Another big day is Sunday,
which Kosko says is “quite
different than other days; it is our
biggest beer day.”

The “O” hasn’t been around as
long as the university itself;
however, when one thinks of the
sights and smells of Oakland, the
“O” invariably comes to mind.

Pitt’ s lady volleyballers ﬁnd help Uptown

Canadian trio sets sights
on Panther victories
‘South of the Border’

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

Quick, if you had to recruit a
volleyball player, what area of

North America would you look .

to? California?

Possibly, after all, that’s where
all those tanned and oiled bodies
spend countless hours jumping
around the beach. Or maybe
you would stay local, in order to
minimize costs and to develop
the area for future recruiting.

But how about Canada?
“Canada?” you ask. Yes, Canada,
the land where Mario Lemieux
and Molsons come from -— you
know, Alaska’s neighbor.

The Pitt women’s volleyball
team has heard of it and has
imported three players from the
Great White North for its current
squad.

In fact, Heather Hollands, Dee
and Michelle
Adamson all grew up within 40
minutes of each other in the
Toronto area.

“I’m sure [volleyball] is bigger I

in other areas, especially the
West Coast, but it’s definitely
growing in Canada,” said
MacAuley.

The current chain of Canadian
Lady Panthers started several
years ago, when former coach
Shelton Collier recruited Louise

 O’Shaughnessy from the Toronto
1 area. Collier told O’Shaughnessy

to keep an eye out for any local
talent while she was home.
O’Shaughnessy mentioned
Adarnson’s name to Collier and
he offered her a scholarship
without ever seeing her play.
Adamson accepted the
scholarship and began her Pitt
career in the fall of 1987.
“Shelton then asked me to do
the same thing as Louise, to let

‘him know of anybody who I

Pitt,” said Adamson.

Adamson coaxed Hollands
and MacAuley, with whom she
had been teammates on an
Ontario Summer Games
championship team, to look at
Pitt, and the Canadian link
continued.

All three cite the fact that
Canadian universities do not give
athletic scholarships as a major
reason for coming to this
country.

“That was a major reason, and
Canadian schools hate to lose
players to the states,” said
MacAuley.

In fact, MacAuley and
Hollands played on the Ontarian
provincial team in 1987, and
from that team, seven members

A left their home country to play

Division I volleyball in the United
States. Schools such as Louisiana
State University and Ohio State
now have Canadians on their
squads this year.

The provincial team that won
the silver medal at the Canada
games wasn’t the first team the
girls had been on. MacAuley
and Hollands also played

A few personal thoughts on what
happened this weekend in sports:

0 Let me start with Pitt football. The
team probably doesn’t mind too much,
but doesn’t it make for a long weekend
when the team you follow has the week
off? It’s like when your favorite professional

“--football team plays on Monday night. May
as well just sleep all day Sunday.

0 Four of the toughest teams that Pitt
has coming up on their schedule won big
this weekend. Penn State destroyed Temple
42-3; Blair Thomas rushed for 138. I still
don’t think Thomas has lived up to his pre-
season hype. Hey Blair, I'm not convinced
y .

West Virginia beat South Carolina 45-
21. Major Harris had a big day completing

17-20 passes for 239 yards. Pitt meets the
Mountaineers in West Virginia on Sept. 30.

Miami bombed another team that
shouldn’t even be on the field with them

in the first place. California had a .500
winning percentage last year, which is
rare for a Miami opponent this year. Miami
won by four touchdowns and four extra
points.

Notre Dame didn’t win ‘by as big a
margin, but give them a break; they played
the No. 2 team in the nation, Michigan.
Raghib Ismail, from Wilkes-Barre, Pa.,

 

returned two second—half kickoffs for
touchdowns to key the Irish win, 24-19.
Two notable statistics to the game: the
attendance was 105,912, almost IWiC€ 35
many people that can fit in Pitt Stadium,
and Tony Rice threw only two passes.

Syracuse, Pitt’s next opponent, who
was ranked 11th coming into the week,
deserves to drop in the ranking this week.
Their mediocre performance in their 10-7
victory over Army, didn’t look like a team
that has had a 23-2-1 record since 1987.

0 Our neighbors in Indiana, Pa.‘, have
something to be proud of. Their IUP
Indians defeated Towson State 27-0. IUP
will probably improve on their No. 6
national Division 11 ranking.

0 In other —non—local college football,

Arizona upset the No. 6 ranked Oklahoma
Sooners. It’s amazing what probation can
do.

Florida State narrowly missed a 0-3
start by beating LSU 31-21. They were
ranked in the top ﬁve in preseason.

0 With only three top 20 teams losing
this week, it will be interesting to see what
happens to Pitt’s No. 14 national ranking.
There’s a good chance Pitt and Syracuse
will be right next to each other, setting up
an interesting contest in five days.

- Turning to professional sports, the
Steelers looked a lot better than last week.
Sure they lost by another million, this time
to the Cincinnati Bengals, but there were
some goodsigns. Louis Lipps proved that
he can stillcatch the ball in a crowd, for

Getting an education in the city requires more than study

When you packed up your stuffed
animals in Farmville, Iowa, and
headed for the University of Pitts-
burgh, you expected to learn
from books — for a change. You
forgot what it’s like to wake up to
a rooster and learned how to
wake up to the buzz of your
wonderful roomie’s alarm four

_ hours before your first class.

I guess mostpeople think that
they can cope with their own
sense of culture shock and that

,_ the big city is really a fun sort of

town. And it is, until Bobbie Jean
makes that first fatal mistake of

walking alone. It may not hap-

pen on Bobbie’s first venture into
the jungles of Oakland.‘ It may
even be on her thousandth. But
there is a 99.9 percent chance
that one night or day, it will.

Bigotry stands in the way of our American ideology

Some words inspire fear. Some
inspire hatred. Some inspire of-
fense.

These are ourdirty words, our
obscenities. They shake things
up, break up the ﬂow of words
that normally streams through
our minds.

Usually these words are sexual
in nature or refer to some bodily
function. They range from the
mild oath to the explicit epithet.

But some of the dirtiest words I

are entirely different. Some words,
when used in certain contexts,
can ensure that one is never
taken seriously. One word in
particular can turn someone with
a valid concern into a monster —-
dangerous, threatening, malicious
 dirty.

This word is “radical.”

In Webster's brave New World,
to be radical means that you are
“favoring basic change, as in the
social or economic structure.”

Sounds relatively tame, doesn’t
it? But take a politically aware
and involved group, label them
radicals and watch how quickly
the “huddled masses,” who were
themselves brought together by
a group of radicals (Iefferson,
Washington, Adams, etc.) huddle
themselves against the offending
group. To these people, radical is

Throughout American history,
radicals have typically espoused
such radical causes as rights for
women, blacks, Native Ameri-
cans and other minorities. They
have encouraged such radical
reforms as the end of slavery, an
end to discrimination, the right to
vote and an end to war. I

Pittsburgh has its own share of

radicals. One group which has
been in the spotlight in the last
week is the gay and lesbian group
Cry Out!, which has been vocal in
its stand on the recent beating
death of David Piergalski in
Schenley Park, just blocks away
from our campus.

They have expressed a belief
that Piergalski, who was gay, was

told to leave Dithridge Street, a

through her body to finally reach
her book-smart brain. She will

eyes will dart from left to right

(quicker than at any tennis match)

until she sees what has caused

this electrifying terror to gnaw at
her heart. With any luck, she will

react in the proper way (which

means that she must outsmart the

other person, who is probably a

professional at this game).

They have also charted a dras-
tic increase in incidents of dis-
crimination and violence against
gays, with this murder being the
most recent and dramatic ex-
ample.

On Saturday night, members of
Pittsburgh’s gay community and
other supporters of the gay rights
movement held a candlelight
procession walking down Craig
Street, circling the block to
Dithridge. They were there to
grieve the death of Piergalski and
to protest the harassment of gays
in that area of Oakland by the
police. They were expressing their
concerns over the homophobia
that has been manifesting itself in
Pittsburgh.

And that homophobia is strong.

“When the city council voted

against a ' gay-rights ordinance,
most of the members who op-
posed gave as their reason their
belief that the legislature was
unnecessary, that there was not a
significant problem. But Otis
Lyons, the council member whose
change of mind deadlocked the
legislation in a 4-4 tie, told The

God doesn’t want that abomi- '

nation? Godjseems to spend a.
great deal of time providing a
rationale for people to be closed-
minded, bigoted and afraid.
Wasn’t it God who told white
slave-owners that blacks were
the children of Cain, the first
murderer? Wasn't it God who
passed along, through St. Paul,
the edict “Wives, be subject to
your husbands?”

And that is what the issue really
comes down to, bigotry and fear.
The human race is notoriously
intolerant of anyone who differs
from the “norm.” When a group
of gay and lesbian men and
women band together to protect
their way of life, when a group of
blacks unite to fight for equal

a rights, when a group of women

join in solidarity to speak out for
their rights — the easiest thing to
do is to label them “radicals” and
ignore them.

my case, Shadyside) who care

grateful I was and still am. I also
hope that there are other men
(and women) out there reading
this who may not have realized
what a shame it is that a woman,
young or old, cannot even walk
to the store without being afraid.
Bobbie Jean, and every other
person out there who may be
placed in this terrible situation,
believe your instincts, do what-
ever it takes to save your skin;
and above all, don’t give up hope.

she is gay — this cannot be
allowed to continue.

When a man is beaten to death
because he is a homosexual ——
this must not be allowed to con-
tinue. ‘

When someone is denied a job
or a place to live because of their
sexual orientation, then the world
becomes that much’ poorer a
place. I

And when “gay” is a dirty word,
people need" to reassess their
values. Society is always looking

for those who are different. How ,

long will it take for society to stop

.viewing these people as threats?

America prides itself on individu-
ality but is intolerant of it when it
occurs. As long as this double
standard is allowed to continue,
America can never be a great
nation. The foundation of our
society is freedom, and without a
strong foundation, the structure
can never be strong. So far, all
that Americans have earned for
posterity is an entry in ‘some
future history book saying, “The
nation was characterized by inter-
nal hatred and prejudice, the very
things it was founded to fight.”
From the Civil .War to’ civil

found an internal peace. Until
bigotry is a thing of the past, it

-never will.

,,The truth and some lies about the college relationship

Relationships with members of
the opposite sex are always ex-
citing and well worth the time
they crave. OK——- so I lied.

When you first come to Pitt as
a freshman, you may be lonely
and in need of someone to spend
every waking moment with. Or,
worse yet, you may be dragging
your high school sweetie into

‘your new life at college. Either

9.

way, it is not a good idea to have
a boyfriend/ girlfriend while you
are at school.

There are lots of obvious rea-
sons why spending time with
your friends and your books is
geferable to walking dreamily
along thinking about that special
someone in your life. Among

these is the fact that you have
come to college for one main
reason ——- to get an education.
,With the ups and downs a rela-
tionship causes, studying is
commonly the last thing on your
mind.

Aside from the boost to your
GPA that remaining unattatched
causes, it is good for your emo-

tional stability and promotes self-
learning (as corny as that may
sound). And it is hoped that self-
confidence will follow when you
realize than you can be by your-
self and still have a good ol’ time.

Speaking from experience, I
know that members of the male
species can be demanding of
your time and your energy —

and I suspect that females can
also be guilty of the same things.
In college, especially in your first

year or two, you need all the time
you can get to become accli-
mated to the new environment
and the concept of studying.
Besides, girls need to go out
with just “the girls” as much as
boys ‘(excuse me, men) need to
go out with just “the boys." It's
awfully difficult to go to a party
with the person you are dating

 

L and still meet other people ——- in

fact, it’s next to impossible.
And of course, I’m leaving out
the most obvious of all the rea-
sons: the fact that there are -just
loads of hunks (and I suppose

. that there must be some attrac-

tive females out there too,) wait-
ing to be met. Who am I to turn
my back on a job that I was
destined for? It is a tough job, but
as the saying goes...

So, if you are one of the many
freshmen out there who left your
high school girlfriend/boyfriend
behind when you came to Pitt,
my prediction is that you’ll be
lucky to last out the year. I know
that you think you are different,
and you and your honey will be

one of the few that stay together
through thick and thin. Believe
me, most of you will be swinging
singles by the time you are so-
phomores. I know, you don’t
believe me. That’s OK, I didn’t
believe it either.

But don’t fret. The single life is
not as bad as it may first appear.
I don’t act like those people on
the dating service commercials
and walk around looking sad
and lost, and I doubt you will
either. Like I said before, the
entire population of Pitt is at your
command. There are plenty more
sharks in the ocean.

Campus cop Smith inducted into U.S. Martial Arts Hall of Fame

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

Chuck Norris lands another
drop kick and wipes out the last
remaining evil-doing gangster.
Bruce Lee just threw a villain
twice his size over his shoulder
and turns to hurl some quick jabs
at the villain’s oncoming friend.

The Karate Kid goes into his

crane method and wins the local

championship.
Martial arts is a fast—growing

area of interest in America, and A

the movie business is making
sure to keep up with the public’s
interest.

Curtis Smith, of the University
of Pittsburgh’s Department of
Public Safety, is Pitt’s own version

’ of Chuck Norris.

Smith, who is a martial arts
instructor at Pitt, was elected to

the United States Martial Arts Hall

of Fame this summer. Smith was
selected under the competitive
aspect in the weapons division,
Smith first got interested in
martial arts in his high school
days. He continued practicing in
the field through his college days

i at Pitt. He was also a blocking

back on the Pitt football team in
the days of Tony Dorsett and
Matt Cavanaugh.

“After football practice I would
limp and go train for my martial
arts, unless I was really beat up
said Smith.

“Beyond that, I would spend the

1

rest of the night studying.”

Srnith’s dedication to the martial
arts has earned him over 200
competition awards. In 1977 he
was the national AAU runner-up.
Along with that silver medal, he
was part of the 1977 National
Champion Lake Erie Association
tae kwon do team.

He was also a many-time
Pennsylvania state champion in
self defense. A self—defense
committee also selected Smith to
be listed in Vt’/790's Who in
American Martial Arts.

Smith took some years off
competing, but continued to
develop his instructional skills.
He returned to the competitive
field a few years ago, and his
performance is not showing signs
of dropping off.

In 1986, Smith was the
Pennsylvania Karate Belt
Champion. Since his return to
competition, Smith has earned
about 60 more trophies. He is
now a fourth-degree black. belt

Smith said the sporting aspect
of martial arts hasn’t changed
much in the years he has been
involved with it. One difference,
however, is that there are more
and better people competing.

“In fact, that’s why I came back
competing. There’s a lot of new,
young competitiors out there and,
of course, they say, ‘Who’s this C.
Smith?’ So I came back out, and
once again showed them who

“The young ones are trying to
look up to someone who would
represent that mystic that they
have of a high-level master.
Sometimes you don’t always get
that; they get out of shape and
live on reputation alone. It helps
not [to live in the past so much
but to] get something current
going,” said Smith.

According to Smith, the reason
for the increased popularity of
self-defense is due mainly to ESPN
showing martial arts competitions,
the Olympic glamor (T ae Kwon
Do was an Olympic exhibition
sport in 1988) and the Norris and
Lee movies.

Smith is also having fun with
martial arts and is getting into the
entertainment act. He puts on
shows throughout the university
in which he performs
choreographed martial arts to
music with an international group.

He was «also part of a fantasy
music video with the Cleveland
Browns football team, called the
Matters of tbe Gridiron- Part of
the video, which supported the
United Way, was a fight scene
between Smith and‘ the Browns
ex-center Mike Baab. V

Smith has a recently published
martial arts instructional book,
called BYAM (Buy Yourself A
Minute). The book goes along

with his training method of the I

same name. 5

Smith is also an adviser and
instructor at the East-West Martial
Arts Club. Smith describes his
style of training as innovative and
not conservative.

“The club has grown a lot and,
in fact, sometimes has taken the
forefront as a club, because we ’re
innovative,” said Smith. “We get
into many different facets of
martial arts, including weaponry
training. We get into both the
ancient -and modern-type
weapons that you can utilize for
self- protection.”

Smith has proven himself just
as competent an instructor as
competitor. He recently coached
a team of Pitt students at the
Police Athletic League nationals.
Dave Schurz was a national

 

champion in his category. Brian
Volp and Brad Benz were bronze
medal winners. ,
He strives to make his students
balanced in their martial arts. He
doesn’t encourage them to be

strictly Judo or Karate. He likes 9

his students to be equally adept
at using their hands and feet.

Smith added that to have a he-
man and macho approach to
martial arts is something he likes
to avoid. In fact, having that
approach actually shows poor
training, according to Smith.

“Most of all I like to build up
my student's character and self
conﬁdence,” said Smith.

Men's
tennis
finishes
fifth

By Adam Kamras
(1 For The Pitt News

Despite a difficult draw
and a rough start, the men’s
tennis team rebounded
from zero points on the ﬁrst
day of the Men's Big East
Tennis Tournament to ﬁnish
fifth with 14 points in the

J eight team contest.

if», The Georgetown Hoyas
won the tourney with 38
points, followed closely by
Providence, who earned 36
points.

Pitt coach George
Dieffenbach was very
pleased with the way his
team fought back on the
second day of the
tournament. He calledthe
tournament a complete
team effort with‘ every
member of the squad
contributing to the team’s
14 points. A ,

Dieffenbach said that the
finest individual Pitt
performance of the
tournament was Paul
Maben’s tough three set loss
to Mike Rafferty of Boston
° College; 4-6, 7-6, 6-1. In the
second set he was just a

pulling off a very big win
for the Panthers; Maben also
lost to Providence’s Jeff
Mornesh; 6-2, 3-6, 6-3.
Maben came back in the
doubles competition with
his partner Vivek Kumar to
1.} win matches against
 Villanova and Connecticut
only to lose in the ﬁnals
against Georgetown; 7-5,
6-2. ’

Kumar also fared well in
his singles matches as he
won consolation matches
against Keith Callahan . of
Seton Hall; .6-3, 7-6 and
Mark Pi-zzi of Villanova; 6-
3, 7-5.

Dieffenbach’ was also
pleased that his squad
improved upon last year’s

* ‘gbsixth-place performance by
beating out cross-state rival
Villanova for fifth place. He
was happy with the way his
team fared well in head-to-
head matches with
Villanova, defeating them
by one point.

In other matches, No. 1
Pitt player Terrence
Rosenthal -lost his opening

Georgetown; 7-5, 6-2. He

For The Pitt News

This past weekend’s IUP
Invitational seemed like any other

I cross country meet for the Pitt

Panthers. At the conclusion of
the meet, the results sounded
normal. Pitt, although
disappointed, made! a good
showing among tough
competition and placed sixth
overall. ' '
Sophomore Stacy Wyzykowski
placed third overall in the race,
with a time of 19 minutes, thirty-
seven seconds. On a normal
Saturday afternoon it would have
been a good day for Wyzykowski,
but today it was one full of
disappointment. '
Wyzykowski was running a

great, controlled race, staying near 9

eventual winner Claire Forbes of
Virginia. A
Then disaster struck for
Wyzykowski. The Pitt sophomore
took a wrong turn.
“Everyone was screaming at

the Virginia girl to follow me,"
said Wyzykowski, who felt she
was running a great race until
that point.

“The way they explained it to
us I thought I was going the right
way. No one told me anything.
The only thing I heard was

someone yelling ‘Hey girl.’ I didn’t

think that it was the best way to
get me back on the course. I had
no idea who they were talking to.
By the time I realizedl was off the
course, I was 25 yards and 10 to
15 seconds behind,” added
Wyzykowski. L
Pitt coach John Vasvary was
also a little disappointed.
“Stacy was running right up
there with the girl from Virginia.
We thought she went the right
way. Even the Virginia coaches
were telling their girl to follow
Stacy. She would have deﬁnitely
taken at least second if she hadn’t
gotten off the course. She was
running a good race,” said
Vasvary.
Wyzykowski also thought she

would have had a shot at being
the first across the ﬁnish line if
she hadn’t gotten off track.

“I was running better than last
week, and the course was in
better shape. It would have went
down to the ﬁnish, I think,” said
Wyzykowski.

The rest of the Pitt team didn’t
manage to place in the top ten,

ran in good competition.

The Pitt women’s tennis squad
suffered two consecutive setbacks
on Sunday, bowing to Bucknell
and West Virginia on the road by
scores of 7-2 and 8-1 , respectively.

Panther head coach George
Dieffenbach took a
predominantly young team to
West Virginia for a pair of matches
against two of the better squads
in the Tri—State area. He feels that
although the setbacks were not
enjoyable for the program, Pitt
can benefit from the losses.

“I’m disappointed that we
lost both matches, but we were
competitive,” Dieffenbach said at
practice yesterday. “It appears
that Bucknell and  were
much tougher than we
anticipated, but at least it shows

have to play at if we’re going to

one. I’d think of another, but it
was hard enough to come up
with one.

0 I thought the Vikings were
unbeatable, but I was obviously
wrong. Their lack of a running
game really hurt. They had about
as many yards running the ball as
the Bengals had sacks. Anthony
Carter is unstoppable, why not
throw to him on, say, every down?

-‘ Game of the week:
Philadelphia and Washington.
Washington held a 30-14 half-
time lead, only to have the Eagles
score 28 in the second half and
come up the winner. The Eagles
had only 65 yards rushing but
didn't need any more with Randall
Cunningham's 400+ yards
passing. Gerald Riggs ran for 200+
yards for the ‘Skins.

- Dan Marino threw for his
200th touchdown on Sunday. He
reached that mark faster than
anyone else in NFL history. His
Dolphins beat New England 24-
10.

- I almost forgot. Baseball
season is still going on. They
really need to do something about
the seasonal overlap. By the time

baseball comes to its dramatic -

finish, nardly anyone cares.

However, there are still some

points of interest left.
0 The American'League races
are tight with Toronto and
Oakland leading their respective
divisions. I The underdog
Baltimore Orioles and California
Angels are still within striking
range. ‘Look for the leaders to
‘extend their leads this week.
0 Another interesting race in
baseball is who will get that ever-

coveted _100th loss of the season I
‘R .. first, the Detroit Tigers or the

Atlanta Braves. Both teams seem
to want the distinction real bad.
Good Luck, Guys.

0 The Cubs and Giants will
hold on to their leads in the

National League. The Mets_ will A
give the Cubs one more run, but 

they won't get there, I hope.

0 Last year’s World Series‘

champs, the Dodgers, will fall
even further below .500 this
week.. With L.A. still trying to
rely on old-timers like Eddie
Murray, Rick Dempsey and Micky
Hatcher, it doesn't look like they’ll
be back in contention for a while

0 The Pirates have been hot
lately; too bad it’s mid-September.

“We don’t see Michelle that
much because she lives farther
away, but I see Dee quite a bit,
although not that much this past
summer,” said Hollands.

First-year head coach Sue
Woodstra indicated that she will
continue recruiting up north with

‘£916 help of the Canadian trio.

“I’ve asked them to keep-an eye
open... and to let me know,” said
Woodstra.

 

     

Chuck Noll has had his ups and downs in the 21 seasons
he's coached the Steelers. None may be more telling

1 this year, which if the team does not pick up from its
lackluster performances of the past two weeks, may be his
ﬁnal with the team.

Later that day, the traditionally

little trouble in dropping the Pitt
season record to 3-2.

The highlight for Pitt came early
on when LoPrinzi won a thrilling
