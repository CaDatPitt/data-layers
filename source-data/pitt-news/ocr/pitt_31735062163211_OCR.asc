breaking the “no alco-
hol” rush rule.

The central rush com-
mittee‘ furthermore in-
tends to enforce_ the rules
through the strict punish-
ment of violators; Special
attention was brought to
the ruling concerning the
usage of alcohol on cam-
pus.

More Scholarship Student

Parker Enright, new as-
sistant dean of men and
advisor to the fraternities,
brought the attention of

the council to a set of
ﬁgures indicating the in-
creased push among stu- '
dents on scholarships. The
present freshman class,
where 86 per cent of fresh-
man men were in the top
two—ﬁfths of their gradu-
ating classes, has indicat-
ed an especially strong"
scholastic intent.

The fraternities are
planning on giving scho-
lastics a stronger consid-
eration in present and
future dealings. '

olksingers Show

BY LARRY BERNFELD
A Hootenanny rehearsal at

F’ "Fitzgerald Music Hall’ sounds

like a. meeting of all the North-
ern Ozark “geetars” in the

l'world’s largest chicken house.

Though the accoustics of Tos-
canini’s home-away-from-home
were better suited for wrestling
matches, a rehearsal time seem-
ed to be the right time to catch

1-the .spirit of the good folks

‘ gathered tosing a Hootenanny.

The ABC cameras, a neces-
sary evil, were a major distrac-

‘tion from an expected “take off
. your shoes .

, come on and sit
a while” feeling. The fo1ksing-
ers, themselves, however, were
a-friendly and informal group.

Josh White, the "elder states-
man” or the “hootenanniers,”
refused to be addressed as

ABob Flick. All four attended

the University of Washington
in Seattle.’ Getting their start
like many amateur groups
across the country, they sang

 on campus and about Seattle
_‘town. In 1959, the “brothers”

turned pro, and a year later;
they cut their ﬁrst album.
Kirkland remarked that

the Brothers Four had sung
at “at least 600 colleges.”
Eric Weissberg of the Tar-
riers, not to be outdone, then
cut in, “Well, the Tarriers
have been to ‘at least’ six
colleges.” Weissberg, who
Kirkland called “the best
‘banjo player in the entire
universe” rejoined Marshall
Brickman and Clarence
Cooper on stage and exhibit-
ed some, realﬁne banjo pic-
kin.’

The Tarriers, Weissberg later i

said, won’t be on tour long be-
cause of a three month engage-
ment at the “Bitter End” in

ucessful white group, and who
did not have to do their share

for the “March” unless they _

really wanted_to.

Stuart Scharf is Bibb’s guitar‘
accompanist. A Phi’ Beta Kappa
math major from City College,
New York, he gave up math for
his ﬁrst love, music. Scharf and

Bibb met through a mutual
guitar shop owner in Brooklyn.
Making Money «Nowl

“I’m making money‘ this
year,” Scharf said. “Next year
I _might starve, but'I’ll be hap-
py doing it. I’ve talked to a lot
of ‘almost’ musicians, but they
really don’t exist. If you’re go-
ing to ‘make the break into the
‘arts’ it. has to be clean and
complete.” . '

. The Roof Top Singers, re-

presented by Erik ‘Darling of
.New York City who wears
“finger picks "at all times ex-
cept when I sleep,” summed"
up the effects of folksinging ‘
on college campuses, “It is
getting an enthusiastic recep.-
tion, encouraging amateur
groups and is still growing.”

Flick of the Brothers Four,
capped the summary on the ef-,
fests of folksinging with “It
sure has sold a lot of guitars
and banjos.” '

BY MATTHEW SWETONIC

An acquaintance -of mine
once told me that hootenannies
are simply loads of fun and that
the television variety was a
good example of a bonaﬁde
hoot. He must have been either
an unmittigated liar or a real
loony, for no one who had to
clap, sing, and shout his way
through the almost two hours
of rehearsed spontaneity which

gutted a redecorated ﬁeld house -

last Wednesday evening could
call such an event anything but
ridiculous.

The evening even started out
wrong. ,

[- i   Expansion Halted A *

The idea of an expanding university isa rather pleasant

' picture for any of us to imagine. In our own case, we can

see part of this as a reality rather than merely assome gran-

diose plan for the future. In the past few years, a number
_. of new structures have been. erected on this campus, the

latest of which being the three circular men’s dormitories.
In other parts of the state, the University has set about
the establishment of regional campuses to service the educa-
tional needs of all of western Pennsylvania.
I Personnel-wise, the University has done a thorough job
of cleaning out the undesirable elements in its teaching and
administrative facilities and is constantly striving to im-
prove the quality of the instructors coming into the school.
And now, plans are in the hands of architects and con-
tractors for an even more extensive expansion program" the

A likes of which this section o the country has never seen.

   

 

The cry of the hour is “Expansion!” However, there ap-

- pears to be one direction in which the University is not
willing to permit the growing fever to take hold, and that

is in the ﬁeld of student affairs. By this is not meant affairs

I handled by the University for the sake of the students, but

the affairs of the students as handled by themselves.

V Last week the annual allocations were distributed to 4
‘the various student organizations on campus, and they were, -_

in every case, a disappointment to the bodies concerned.‘

' In an expanding University, it -is a crime when a differ-
entation is made between the institution and its student

I body,'and when one islencouraged to expand while the

 A The

 

     
 

other is asked to stand still. In this case, the milk was taken

I from the organizations to feed the new dorms.

It is not that money was taken away from the student
bodies, just that the additional money needed to ﬁnance
new or improved projects was cut from the budgets.

What this will mean this year in terms of service to the
students is certainly not very promising, and it appears
that before the student organizations are able to themselves
expand in conjunction with the institution as a whole, some-
thing will have to be done to convince the University that
there are more things of importance to the student body
than just giving them a new place to sleep.

Who's to Say? . . .

A Skeptic's Skeptic

By Pat Pollino

In a welcoming address delivered to some 200 ‘

transfer students and an army of incoming fresh-
men, Chancellor Litchﬁeld underscored skepticism

as an attitude worth possessing.. However, he was
quick to point out that one.
must not be overbearingly ,
skeptical.

Perchance he realized that
if a number of those students
within earshot of his remarks
had been unduly skeptical to-
ward the idea of entering the
University of Pittsburgh, his
audience could well have been
minus a few heads.

This kind of skepticism
would be hard to swallow for s _
the University, for —— indeed existing as a money-
making machine which turns out an assembly
line of graduates — it would suffer the pangs of
ﬁnancial hollowness. V

 

But to be an individual is, as the Chancellor

noted, fo be skeptical. Then’ there_are those‘in-
dividuals who are skeptical about skepticism.
More speciﬁcally skeptical of . . .

Way back when the engineers decided that the
University would shoot for the moon in the ‘form
of a skyscraper, a section of the populace ‘ex-
claimed it couldn’t be done. Some people are
afraid of heights, they say. .

Half-time pep talks can do wonders at times.

To be loved is to be yourself. Can an agnostic‘

look through a mirror both ways? Repeat: Skep-
ticism is a reflection of the individual. '

Should we accept everything with a grain? If
so, who’s to say whether we should or should not?

Seeds of Apathy . . .

  The   Anti — Pitt

The anti-Pitt is a strange breed of the Student
Cool. His world is a grumbling mass of dissatis-

» faction and This primary asset is the ability to

spread his discontent to the naive or the gullible.

This composite personality '
type often arises when per-
sonal failure 'is unattributable
to open or tangible forces. vA
low mark on a paper is most
easily blamed on a school sym-
bol -— the poor prof, bad study
conditions, uninteresting course
material — never on the three
beers preceding the all-nighter
he had to pull to complete the
paper.

Third Manifestation

Still a third manifestation of the anti-Pitt is
found in a segment of commutingistudents. Dis-
satisﬁed and possibly feeling cheated because they
do not have the addedjconvenience and pleasure
of living on campus, the grumblers complain that
the University is little more than an extension
of high school. There is little stimulation to work
and the social life is completely nil. The com-
munity, often anxious for ﬁrst-hand information
straight from the proverbial horse’s mouth, form

their judgments from the noises made by the p

strong voiced minority.

There is an interesting “why” behind the
actions of the anti-Pitt. To compensate for their
personal dissatisfaction, they magnify and spread
their complaints, thereby obtaining their “cools.”
The unknowing community often views the .anti-
Pitt as Candide saw Pococurante —— “What a
genius this Pococurante is. Nothing can please
him.” The truth of the matter also lies in a later
“The pleasure of the dissatisﬁed is
in not being pleased.” . A

I do not mean to imply that the insuﬂicient
instructor or bad meals do not exist. There is
deﬁnitely" room for improvement in many phases
of University life. Furthermore, there always will
be room for improvement. Nor have I written

anti-Pitt. He exists now and will continue to

comforting assurance of a basic democratic
freedom.

Learn By Experience

The uninitiated, however, should not too
quickly involve himself in Pococurante’s pseudo-
sophistication. Learn the facts through experi-
ence. Meet the people and the school before
making judgments. A I

This past summer, the Student Union Board

and the upper class counsellors worked voluntar-

ily and diligently through six freshmen orienta-

tion periods in order to present the University in
a more accurate light. As a result of their eﬁorts,
one-fourth" (rt the undergraduate student body
came to school this fall on a positive footing,

‘with the desire to make their own experiences_

known.

An overview of this problem may offer a par-
tial account of student apathy. On" many occa-
sions the anti-Pitt and the apathetic student are
one and the ‘same —— willing to complain, but,un-
willing to aid in making the corrections. As a
local editor-in-chief once remarked, “Why hold
forums on student apathy when only the un-
apathetic will attend?” ' '

The solution to this problem lies in its pre- »

vention, notin trying to halt the rolling tide once
it has begun to spread.

A: quiet school pride from the start is the most
effective preventative for later apathy. The desire
to voice an honest and objective complaint and
the ability to stay with the problem to its solution
will arise from an enlightened student body.

The orientation sessions were-a two-fold step
in the direction of dispelling the anti-Pitt propa-

ganda and in eliminating the seeds of apathy.‘

More efforts of this type, however, are necessary,
and in the future a larger part‘ of this task will
fall to the freshman of the present.

Finances Needed ‘
To Help Student

Expansion Cut

(Continued from Page 1) ,
much money to work with as we
have requested, and this year is
no exception, Martha Holstein,
Student Union Board vice-presi-
dent, stated. “We have resigned
ourselves to maneuvering as well
as possible within a framework we
cannot control.

“The programs which have
been planned already will not
have to be cancelled in the light
of our budget, nor will they be
reduced in scope. ,We feel that we
can still contribute adequately -
if not impressively —— to the over-
all impressive University scene.”

I and .F Pessimistic

Bonnie Klepper, b us in e ss
manager of Ideas and Figures
was less optimistic. She applied
for four times the amount she
received last year. “It doesn't
reflect the growth of the maga-
zine. I personally feel that the
University ' is doing nothing to
help the magazine survive.”

She continued, ‘.‘We can’t make
up the cut by soliciting more ads.
"As things stand now we can’t
bring out any issues this year. All
our appropriations will go for last
year’s expenses.” _

WPGI-I general manager, James
Kleinberg, said that he was hap-
py on one hand that they have
been recognized and have been
given something of a budget, but
on _the other hand it was no-
where near the budget we re-
quested. We still have to cut
our ‘program schedule instead of
expanding it as we were hoping
to do.”

He summed up the views of
all interviewed thus: “It is un-
fortunate that the University
which is trying‘ to establish a
national reputation for itself

_lacks the funds for ‘student ac-

‘tivities which would allow them

to keep pace with the growth
of the University even though

. the students show Interest and

are willing to devote time to
them.” " ‘

Office Space Available

For Student Groups

By LUCY’ CORRENTI

Larry Heller, director of Stu-
dent Union activities, has an-
nounced that office space is now
available in the SU for use by
student organizations.

In addition to space already be-
ing used by student organizations,
several rooms on the ﬁfth floor,
SU will be appropriated for use
by those organizations most in
need of them. Space on the ﬁrst
four of the Union is also being
cleared by moving those organiza-
tions already holding offices.

Arrording to Heller, space will
be allocated on the basis of need
for any type of office facility,
what use the organizationdesires
to make of the space, and the or-
ganization’s need for maintaining
a regularly staffed office;

Might Share Offices‘

He also stated, “Several organi-
zations might make use of the
same room. One- organization
might use an office in the morn-
ing and another in the afternoon.
Or an organization may need
nothing more than a desk or ﬁl-
ing space. In such a case this
space could bemade available to
them in a room already being
used by one or more organiza-
tions.

“There is also a. great need
for meeting and. conference
space. Last year 104,000 people
were granted permission by the
SU Committee to use space for
meetings nad conferences.
..This great number does not in-
clude those who were refused.”
Thus. the number of now vacant
offices available for student use
will depend largely on the de-
mand for meeting and conference
space. '

Difficulty Task
Although the task of appropri-

ating office space a fair and help-
ful way is a difficult one, efforts

are being made to use the space .

in the most economical and con-
venient way.

As an example of this, Heller
said" “The Chaplain’s "office and
young Men’s-Young Women's
Hebrew Association have been

, moved to the fifth ﬂoor. with the
Dean of Men’s office, releasing
that space for student ‘organi-
zations.

“We could not, however, have
moved very busy, noisy organiza-
tion such as WPGH to thatﬂoor
and still have kept the situation
to everyone’s convenience.”

By MARV ZELKOWITZ

, When Jim Irwin was a
_ freshman football player,
he_ wanted to play full-
, ‘back, but was assigned to
g '  guard position. He was
i dissatisﬁed with the
“change, but accepted it. He
is now battling Ed Adam-
_chi_k for the right guard
I starting spot.

._ .“I remember when I was
’a freshman and saw my
name up on the list as a

    
 

heart dropped to my feet.

7 “Then one of the coaches
asked me if I’d rather be a
starting guard. or a ﬁfth
{string fullback. I told him I’d

guard,”‘ Irwin recalled. “My

rather play fullback,” he said.

“Then the coach told me
that my.attitude was wrong,
and that Jock Suther1and’s
boys wouldn’t complain like
that. So I told him that Jock
Sutherland wasn’t at’ Pitt
anymore, and that we should
not be playing the kind of
football that was" played 30
years ago.” '

But since then, Irwin’s at-

titude has changed, accord-W

ing to guard coach Steve
Petro. “He didn’t like the

change at ﬁrst,” Petro said,
“but he’s been cooperating

-ever since. ~

“We switched him to guard
because we didn’t think he

- had the speed or the ability

to be at college fullback, al-

though he played fullback
in high school,” Petro said.
Although Irwin has coop-
erated with the coaching staff
on his playing the guard posi-
tion, he is not happy- with
the change._“I’d still rather
play fullback” he said.
Irwin, who made honorable

mention ‘all - America 1 a s t -

year_ w h i l e a ﬁfth string
guard,‘has done “pretty well”
in the spring and summer

practice sessions, according to

Petro. ‘ ' .
“He’s much better thanlast
year,” the guard coach said.
‘‘He’s improved in his (ﬁen-
sive maneuvers and he knows
more of his assignment. De-
fensively,‘ of course, there’s

always something to learn.

“Of course, Irwin has his
weaknesses,” P e t r o contin-
ued, “but everybody has some
weaknesses. He is deﬁnitely
a very worthy prospect. He
will make the right guard
position very competitive.”

Irwin, who gained his all-
American recognition for his
performance in the Army
game, played ﬁfth string
guardin the following game
against Penn State. Petro ex-'
plained why: “Irwin actually A
played a lot less in the Army
game than most people rea-
lize. He only was in for four-
teen plays. Then, ‘too, he
didn’t know his offensive as-
signment.”

Our Purpose:

 

Sophs Seek Starting Positions
To Aid Varsity Soccer Team"

The ﬁrst large group of freshman soccer scholarship holders
has moved up to the varsity this year and promise much in the’

way of talent. .

Freshman coach Bob McNulty cited George Jamolenko, Dom
Milillo, George Sommer and Jim Cuddy as sophomores that

should be able to help the varsity.

“Jarmolenko will probably draw a lot of attention from the

defenses since he was our,.big scorer last year,” McNulty said.

McNulty called Milillo “the second best ball-handler coming
up,” and_ said he “showed great improvement over last season

when he was injured a great deal of the time.”

McNulty’ felt confident ‘that Sornmer could break into the
starting lineup. “He has some nicemovés,” the coach said,.“and
is the kind of boy that goes all out. He is an example to everyone

on the team.”

Cuddy was also praised by the coach. Although he played
fullback last year McNulty feels that

halfback.

New Fraternity Adviser Convinced Greek System

Parker Enwright has come

By MARCIA BERNSTEIN

Can Be Beneficial‘ Source On University’s Campus

to the University bringing with him the conviction that

fraternities can be a deﬁnite positivesource on the University’s campus socially, emotional-
ly, and ‘intellectually for the men involved.

Convinced that the University is not anti-fraternity, Enwright, assistant Dean of Men,
adviser to the fraternities, and the latest addition to the Dean of Men’s staff, feels that all
positive contributions‘ that the fraternities can make to the » University and_ the student

body would be welcomed. 6

He personally would be de-
lighted to see the Greeks take
in the sun in
constructive ways.”

Rewarding Experience

“For the- right man,” says

Enwright; “the right fraternity

_can be a very rewarding experi-

ence. »It contributes to his social
maturity and the development of
his character. It can be one of
the most effective methods for
teaching human relations.

“As' the University increases
in excellence, fraternities will
be‘ increasingly important for
the emotional needs of the stu-
dents to be. met,” contends En-
wright. “There is a need in col-
lege men and women to be-
long to a group small enough
to identify with. Fraternities ‘are
an important and «effective way
of meeting this need.”

and well rounded operation,”
Enwright feels. “It has the pri-
mary responsibility for the in-
tellectual welfare and'gdevelop-
ment of its members.

“This is the point at which its
objectives most directly corres-
pond with those of its. institu-
tion. The University itself is in
a condition of almost unprece-
dented change in every way. The
fraternities which are part of the
University are inevitably in a
state of change, too. They. are
making and will be making ad-
justments as long as the Univer-
sity is.”

  B0b   iz:  
Popp, Mazurek, Long
 Surprise at Grid Camp

/.,_

Things we’ve heard.
A A few surprises evoled out of the Panther football,‘
team’s pre-season practice at Meadville, Pa. One of the
biggest was the emergence of Bob Long as the ﬁrst string
right end. Long started out last season as a regular but
soon fell behind Gene Sobelewski and John Jenkins. With
these two returning the prospects for Long did not look
good, but he is apparently long on the abilities that make
a regular. .

The emergence of Ray -Poppon the ﬁrst string was
also somewhat of a surprise. Popp showed ﬁne potential
as a sophomore, but was used infrequently last year due

. to injuries. He has, however, managed to beat off Jeﬁ Ware
and Bernie LaQuinta, both of,whom- played very well on
defense last year. V

Another unusual development had ‘Fred Mazurek

50-yard. dash. The two halfbacks were heralded to be the
fastest men on the team. Mazurek’s stocky build and strut-

The construction of a new physical
education plant on the varsity practice
ﬁeld has forced both the varsity’ and_ frosh
grid teams to use Trees Field. According
to freshmencoach Bill Kaliden the prob-
lem “isn’t too bad now since the freshmen

P are running UCLA plays”. When the frosh
break off among themselves it should pro-
duce some diﬁ'icult situations. 1

Anothervrenovation on the hill caused

a remark from wrestling coach Rex Peery.
The campus police have taken over Varsity Hall, the former
dormitory for many of the wrestlers. Peery said, “They
ﬁnally got the right idea. They should have had the police
up there with the boy a long time ago.”

Vikings on the -basis of the ﬁne kicking he has done in

exhibition contests.

The latest report from the New York Giants gives
Lou Slaby a good chance’ of making the team. Slaby has
worked at both offensive guard and linebacker. Other
Panthers‘ have not fared as well-. Former‘ halfback Bob
Clemens had the unique experience of being cut by two
teams. Clemens was originally cut by the Baltimore Colts,
a team he played for last year, and then was unsuccessful

in trying out for the New York Jets.

C iCr'0pss-Country Team

By ART FLEISCHNER.

A _ Five lettermen return to this year’s cross country team
with hopes of giving the Panthers their ﬁrst winning season

in ‘three years. Seniors Larry Robinson, Bill Mocnik and Steve-
Waslo, plus juniors John Bailey and Ralph Basinski give

’ icoach Carl Rees an experienced squad.

’ Rees said, “Although only the

fscore points, the sixth and sev-
-ferith men are very important. I

am \hoping "that sophomores Dave
Eich_enlaub, ]Don_ Hinchberger and

A _:Torn Sullivan can help. in these

he

*4

 

 

 

spots, if not higher.” . -

Waslo, who had a poor year
lastseason due to a jaw opera-
tion and a poor attitude, should
be able to give Larry Robinson
some support. Robinson was the
Panthers .only consistent runner
last- year. " '

Bees is also hopeful that Bailey
will be improved. “John should
do much better with a year’s
experience. He has the potential
to be a good runner.”

' Basinski should also proﬁt from - '

a years experience. After a fairly
good’ freshman. year, he did not
live up to expectations last sea-
son. ’ ' - .

“I 'am counting upon Eichen-

A-laub, Hinchberger and Sullivan

to give .us some depth,” said
Rees. “In a meet the sixth ‘and
seventh ﬁnishers on our team

_ can prevent the opposition from

getting points, but they do not
score for the_team.”
The cross country team has

been working out at the stadium 

for about ten days. They have
this same length of time to pre-
pare for their -"opening meet
against Slippery Rock on Septem-
ber 21. Last year the Panthers
wonthe meet, 23-33.

“We use to defeat these‘ small
schools like Slippery Rock and
Ohio fairly regularly, but re-
cently they have been putting
a lot of emphasis on cross‘ coun-
try and we ‘have had a rough
time of it,” said Rees.

This year the Panthers have
added Ohio State to their sched-
ule of six meets.

Frosh Football Positions Open

Coach Bill Kaliden’s fresh-
man football team —— although
limitedto only 24 players ——
has more out of state players
than most recent teams have
had.

Nineteen of the gridders are
from Pennsylvania and ﬁveifrom
out of state. The out of state
continent includes two from
Ohio, two from New Jersey and
one ‘from Maryland. -

One of the major problems of
freshman football _here continues

. to.be the lack of sufﬁcent~no,n-
scholarship ‘players. Last season.

the ‘squad was forced, to reduce
their schedule to two games’ be‘-
causeof the shortage of personnel.
Linder Made Captain _, _
It is, not impossible: for former
high ‘school athletes to make the
team if they‘ try out. Former
Pitt captain, Bill Linder was one
of those who started here on
his own.
Thus far this season only four
new players have tried to make
the grade. They are Warren

.3

Sordill, John Wills, Jim Garrett,

who is on a partial scholarship
and Frank Clark. Clark, who

is akickingspecialist and his

addition ,. could give the Pan-

thers an added threat in the

next few seasons.

Commenting on the insufficient
player problem coach Bill Kali-
den said, “We would welcome
the addition of any athlete with
high school experience. We prob-
ably won’t have time to work

with a_boy who has never played

but we are very anxious to give

any interested boy a chance.”   V
Since practice began last Wed.-..-:

nesday the Cubs have been work-
ing against the -varsity. There

have been a number of dummy

scrimmages with the frosh as-
suming the role of UCLA..-

With the beginning of the foot-  
ball year _not far off Kaliderr
feels that the school spirit’ is '3 J

high. He stated, “The spirit has
improved recently, probably‘ due
to increased dorm space.” This

new incentive could become evi- .
