LA Executive Council

Will Decide Next Week  

About Pass-Fail Option

by DAN BOOKER

The Executive Council of the School of Liberal Arts
will decide, probably next week, whether or notto approve
the proposed pass-fail option of the Liberal Arts Cabinet,

according to Dr. James A. Kehl, dean of the school. Ap--

proval would mean that students with more than 64 credits
would be able to take a maximum of six credits for which
he would not receive a letter grade, but rather a pass or fail

grade.

In an afternoon session yesterday, the Liberal Arts
Academic Assembly discussed the pass-fail option, but de-
cided to leave ﬁnal action in the hands of the Executive
Council. Dean Kehl reported that the proposal received op-

posite reactions from the assem-
bled faculty members. Some of
the members asked why a stu-
dent shouldn't have to put his
“academi-2 reputation” on the
line by taking a letter grade.

Other faculty members seemed
to feel that the idea was great,
noted Dean Kehl. Some even
asked, “ Why only two courses
on this basis, why not four?”
Dean Kehl described the overall
discussion as expressing “strong
comments both ways.” The As-
sembly recommended that the
Executive Council review both
extremes of the problem and
make the ﬁnal decision.

Besides being limited to upper-
classmen and a maximum of six
credits, the proposal limits courses
taken on this basis to those not
in a student major or related
ﬁelds. The course credits would

0;, be counted towards graduation,

(‘V

but would not be ﬁgured in the
quality point average of the stu-
dent.

The plan also provides that in-
structors would not- know which,
if any, of the students in his
classes are taking the class on
the pass-fail‘ basis. At the end
of the term, the teacher would
submit a regular letter grade to
the Student Records Office. If
the grade is a “D” or above the
student will receive a “P” (pass)
on his grade sheet and trans-
cript. If the grade is “F,” it will
be recorded as such. Once a stu-
dent has exercised the pass-fail
option for a course, he cannot
change it to a letter grade basis.

The Academic Assembly is
composed of anyone who teaches
in the undergraduate courses in
the School of Liberal Arts.

under the direction of Tom Rush

qualiﬁed students. The Center re-
cently published a list of over
50 companies offering training
jobs, “where a boy can get ex-
perience in his major or minor
ﬁeld,” stated Rush. The employ-
ment is open mainly to juniors
and seniors, particularly in chem-
ical engineering. _

Rush noted that only two years
ago very few of these job oppor-
tunities were available to college
students, but “due to the efforts
of the Placement Center, and the
relatively good times of the coun-

openings.

Friday, January 20, 19677*i

by LINDA GOLDSTEIN

The bitterness provoked by
by a heated political cam-
paign was apparent to even
the casual onlooker at’ yes-
terday’s Men’s Dormitory-":~
Council (MDC) candidates’
forum. Signs displaying “Ken 
back” and “Vote PPP+” were‘
mild indicators of personal pref-
erence. The blatant likes 
dislikes were revealed in the
pointed questions directed to there-
presidential and vice-presidential‘ .
candidates from the vocal audi;
ence. Om

Dealing with the issues, how- ’
ever the candidates presented the
important points of their respec- ,
tive campaigns to those in at-
tendance. PPP presidential can-
didate John V Ruskay began,» “I
am here to discuss the office of
president of Student Government
(SG). It seems to me that the"
president must do more to offer-
leadership and direction to the-
student body.” He pointed out;
“It is my belief that students 3
have the right to be involved in >
the decision-making process it-_,»
self.” Ruskay listed two “impor-V ;
tant” problems as “the question”:
of quality education” and “the. .
need for student leaders to re- ’
latelto the student body."

ARA presidential nominee Ken 
Frederick stated that “sonie 
ple are questioning where the“. A
student leaders are.” In reply, he 
listed the following “acoomplish- .
ments” of the past year: the
cleaning up of the current Stu-
dent Union (SU); the definite;
promise of a new SU in the near
future; and the likelihood of the T
out-of-state fee being dropped."
Frederick emphasized that “this '
is just a start" and declared the . l__.
ARA?s intentions to “go beyond
these achievements. On the out-‘7
of state students’ issue, we want”:
to go as far as Penn. State and 2
Temple in reducing the tuition,”
he announced.

Vice-presidential candidate for 
the PPP, Terry Hyman, listed .-
some of the PPP’s goals: students, ;
faculty and administrators
working together; student reprc~. v.
senttaives on the University Plan. 
ning Board; the establishmentlof
President’s Monthly Newsletter. 
He stated that Ruskay “is striv- ,
ing toward goals which we ‘must
strive for.”

The ﬁnal speaker, ARA vice. .
presidential candidate Tom Meis- y
ner, made the following state-~~~
ment: “SG is ideas; SG is proj.».-_-_‘
ects. The new Constitution has
been approved by all of us.” He
asked the voters to’ decide ’on they;

to lead your Student Government.
These candidates have focused their energies on plausible and re-
sponsible ideas. But most importantly, they have demonstrated leadership
capabilities which will produce important results. To elect their opponents
would be a needless gamble. PPP candidates John Ruskay and Terry Hy-
man have lackluster records of campus achievement. When they should
have dealt with speciﬁc issues in the campaign, they chose to talk about
ideals for which they offered no practical means of implementation.
The ARA candidates both have effectively lead major campus
groups, while their opponents have not had the intense responsibilities
_, of directing such a -complex organization. Frederick, this year, directed
, Infraternity Council through a period of growth and achievement. Fra-
’ It ternity membership increased, a new‘ national fraternity~- has come on
. campus and two other nationalsare expected to establish colonies ‘shortly.
, Under Frederick’s presidency, Greek Week plans have run smoothly and
7 they should make for one of the best all-fraternity events in recent years.

Meisner added new respect to the organization he was elected to
head—Men’-s Dormitory Council. Caught in the midst of a campus cross
I .ﬁre over distribution. of literature, Meisner skillfully ironed out a solution
. which maintained resident privacy -and protected campus freedoms. The
I Dormitory Weekend represents an innovation in the social life of inde-
pendents which began under Meisner’s presidency.

This is exactly the type of experience their opponents lack. The
_ J PPP candidates have not been faced with the myriad problems of sched-
 uling celebrity entertainment and handling the ﬁnances for major cam-
I -pus events. The students deserve assurance that their Student Govern-
, ment executives have the ability to administer such projects as Home-
 coming, Winter Weekend and Freshmen Outing. Frederick and Meisner’s
qualiﬁcations promise this type of ability.
; The PPP presidential candidate John Ruskay has apparently been
. ‘ on sabbatical from student activities. He has not been a member of one
‘major campus organization or worked on one major event during 1966-67.

Editor, The Pitt News:

" -r We, as Senators of the "1965-66
Student Government from both
.\ the PPP, the Able Party, and
vice-presidents of organizations
J wish to respond to a letter in
the Pitt News, Wednesday, Jan.
‘‘18,1967, entitled “Ex-SG Officers
iTell of Ruskay.” We feel that
the record of Senator Ruskay and
the 1965-66 Senate must be clear-
ly set forth.

 There was confusion in the
Student Government of 1965-66.
]_,Yet it was in this atmosphere
.--that John Ruskay, then a sopho-

"meaningless that it had never
.-even received a proper deﬁnition,

. for six weeks he worked with
f_'a:; fellow senator to produce a
‘Constitution that would provide
{the structure for a truly mean-
" "lngful Student Government—one
that could effectively represent
Pstudent opinions, needs, and in-
 terests. In recognition of his
rk, ‘John received an “Out-
tanding Senator of the Year
Award.” He was chosen to re-
eive this award by Jerry Hogan
and Marsha Bernstein, president

Government that year.

Contrary to what is implied in
the aforementioned letter," John
Ruskay publicly denounced the
resignation and walk-out of Eric
Stern. In this instance and
throughout his term of office, he
assumed leadership and won the
respect of senators from both
parties.
certain inidividuals have misin-
terpreted John’s efforts to make
Student Government a more ef-
fective and functioning organiza-
tion. In viewing John’s record as
one which cast ridicule upon the
University, ' this individuals are
distorting a positive and con-

structive term of office that was _

responsible for the writing of a
new constitution and the redeﬁ-
nition of the meaning and po-
tential of Student Government

lKen     Frederick -- To Lead SG   Onward   

Any election must ultimately be decided on the experience and
achievement that the candidates bring to their positions. These are the
. /only realistic criteria; party platform and propaganda full of impractical
proposals are not. The Pitt News has used these ideas in observing the
1; campaign and the differences have become eminently clear between can-
didates. ARA candidates Ken Frederick and Tom Meisner must be elected

All of a sudden he has regained an interest in campus life. His accomplish-
ments as a senator during the 1.965-66,Student Government were certainly
so questionable that he could never expect to be elected solely on the basis
of his record during that year. ‘
Ruskay in effect seeks your vote because of the advancements in —
student decision-making he promises. We can not disagree with the PPP

desire for students to be a part of policy-making that will effect their

lives. But we must point out to voters that the PPP has failed to pro-
mote any c-oncrete proposals which would mean the student will would be
better articulated in the future. . ,
Student expression on crucial problems will be listened to if the repre-
sentatives of the students are respected by the administration. The Chancel-
lor’s Advisory Committee made the greatest strides ever realized on this
campus toward closing the student-administration communication gap.
The inclusion of the new Student Union in the University master
plan and the forthcoming reduction of out-of-state tuition are direct re-
sults of the advisory group’s massive effort to communicate student opin-
ion to the Chancellor. Ken Frederick and Tom Meisner were part of that
group. Let them continue to gain this progress which they have proved
themselves capable of achieving. _
Any voter must be sure to look at the balance of the tickets. John
Ruskay’s running mate Terry Hyman is attempting to be elected on the
coattails of his more vociferous partner: Hyman has demonstrated that
he has a meager knowledge of campaign issues‘. Moreover, we must doubt
Hyman’s deep interest in the problems he discusses for he failed to raise
many -of these questions during his recent term as an SG senator.
Tom Meisner, on the other hand, has proven himself fully capable
of completing his leadership role. During Frederick’s illness, Meisner led

the ARA campaign with an ease and‘securityl which would be worthy

of any presidential candidate. A slate. must be elected where both men
have proper potential. Ken Frederick and Tom Meisner together repre-
\sent a fully qualiﬁed team.

Finally, we ask you to look at the candidates and consider these
questions. Which slate best reflects your opinion on major issues? Which
slate has shown the best promise of effective administration of your Stu-

dent Government? And lastly, which slate can best articulate your views

on the highest levels of this University? We are certain if the voters
will only rationally answer these questions in their minds, a majority of
the ballots will be cast for Ken Frederick and Tom Meisner.

Ruskay: Practical Ideals  

. by Marsha Rehns, Toni Sacks, Hobart Harris

CREATIVITY, responsibil-
ity and concern are synon-
ymous wit-h John Ruskay
and the tone of his campaign
for the leadership of Student

Government (SG). His prac-

tical proposals and personal
ideals necessitate his election
to the only office where his
goals can be implemented.
Ruskay seeks effective and
responsible student expres-
sion to make each student a
vital part of the rapidly
growing University commun-
ity. The productive interac-
tion of student representa-
tives, faculty, and adminis-

trators is a key issue in the

larger question of student in-
volvement. ‘

Ruskay’s program does not
represent an elitist approach,
but a pervasive concern for
mutual respect and empathy
between faculty administra-
tion and faculty.

AS THE UNIVERSITY ex-
pands both in enrollment and
physical plant, issues direct-
ly affecting students will con-
tinue to arise. Students, as

‘a’ group, willoutlast any in-

dividual’s four ‘years at the»
University. The sentiments
and suggestions of this group
must be heard and consider-
ed when the University Plan-
ning Board decides such is-
sues. .

There may be no alterna-
tive to the site of the new
dormitories, but the hostile
reaction to the hilltop loca-
tion could have been replaced
with constructive s u g ge s -
tions had students known

that their representatives’
were involved in the decision.

pressly concerned with main-
taining the quality of edu-
cation at the University. His
proposal of a “senior assem-
bly of students and faculty
to review courses is a major
area for united action. He
has cited consideration of ef-
ﬁcent use of the new library
facilities ‘as another oppor-
gigiity for joint action by

ONCE STUDENT partici-
pation is achieved, students
must be kept informed of
SG activities. This goal would
be achieved by the PPP-plus’s
proposal for an SG newslet-
ter and bulletin boards in-
forming students, from
nurses to commuters, of the
work of other groups.

Ruskay’s suggestion that
a member of the administra-
tion remain on the Alloca-
tions Committee is a mature
conclusion to his proposal
for student involvement at
all levels. If we are to ask
that student opinions be re-
spected in University deci-
sion-making, we must

acknowledge the ideas of the-

administration in student
planning. A ,
Ruskay’s innovation of the
University Review Board to
air student criticism illus-
trates his ability to realis-
tically convey student senti-
ment to the administration.

Theformation of the board 9

involved -numerous meetings

between Ruskay and the

Dean of Student Affairs.
AWARE OF THE require-

.ments of students and their

leaders, Ruskay co—authored

  
   

d’ e ion;-to.

the SG Collstitugion. He gave _

I representat

for his achievements was
awarded an Outstanding
Senator Award by senator
of bot_h parties. ‘

His leadership ability was
acknowledged even last sum-
mer in Norway where he was
elected a senator from North
America in meetings at the
International Summer School
in Oslo.

Ruskay proposes a dynam-

ic but practical method of
assessing and fulﬁlling stu-
dent needs. It embodies an
ideal that students, ,.faculty,
and administration are re-
spectful enough of one an-
other’s powers and opinions
to make decisions together.
It acknowledges the hard
fact that students must be
intelligently informed of the
issues if their representa-
tives are to effectively rep-
resent them and elicit ad-
ministration respect and con-
sideration. »
_ SG has not been idle dur-
ing the past year, but it can
be allowed neither .to be-
come self-satisﬁed nor to
represent an increasing mass
of uniformed and indifferent
students. Ruskay’s proposals
are lengthy, but they repre-
sent the direction which SG
must take in the years to
come. Ruskay has both ar-
ticulated the issues in a num-
ber of areas and given guide-
lines for resolving them.

" John Ruskay and Terry
Hyman, through their per-
sonal qualiﬁcations and their
public proposals, will "be able
to move SG forward in the
direction ‘of effective and

Banner Anticipates

Close Track iMeet

Track coach Jim Banner wavers between pessimism and
optimism about Saturday’s meet with Kent State. The only
thing Banner is certain about is that the ﬁrst indoor meet

oRebound

 —After suffering their ﬁrst .

not be so easy. Coach Tim Grgu-.

   

»Banner knows that Kent has a top sprinter,‘ two pow-
-erful shot putters and the boy who holds the Fitzgerald
fl-‘Field House record for the mile. Other than this, all he can
{say about the Golden Flashes is, “I just don’t know.”

, E His meet strategy is also uncertain. “We just have to

play it event by event and shuf-
ﬂe what boys we have.” The
track team’s lack of depth will
force Banner to select partici-
pants for each event immediate-
ly before its running instead of
before the meet. ' "

He will have to decide whether
to overload a certain event to
pick up the maximum points or
to save his best runners and use
them individually to avoid a
blank in another event-

He ‘does know his strong points.
“The two mile relay is our
strongest event with Roger Holly
in shape.” Holly strained a ham-
string muscle on his right leg
and has only had light workouts

‘for the past week. Banner feels

_he will probably be all right for
the meet. Ken Lawton, Larry
Hubner and Frank .Handelman
will complete that relay team.

The mile’ relay is another po-
tential strong point. Banner has
six boys to choose from includ-
ing Jack Neyer, Tom Christie,
Paul Lambert, Keith Stoeber,
Carl Wooten and Kingman Da-
vis. This is a luxury Banner_ has
in few other events.

 

 
   
   
   
  
  
  
    
  
  
  
   
   
  
  
   
  
   
 

The Pitt Progressive Party has a plus after its name to

emphasize 3 facts about this year's PPP-plus.

1. The PPP-plus slate includes students from all areas
of the campus.

2. Three of the_most active SURE S_G members —
Senators Hyman, Hershey, and Singer have joined
with JQHN RUSKAY in the hope of making next

E year’s”"SG a more important spokesman. of student
opinion.

3. PPP-plus means not just a slate of candidates . . .
but alsothe STUDENTS they will represent. It
means DIRECT communication between students
and SG, by the President’s newsletters, ‘SG bulletin
boards, formal and informal discussions: —not just
a Week before elections, but THROUGHOUT THE
SCHOOL YEAR.

Panthers Now 3910

St. John’s Greets Hoopsters

by JAY ROSENSTEIN
Assistant Sports Editor
The economic axiom that
states the rich get, richer
while the poor get poorer of-

ten holds true in collegiate
basketball. The Panther quintet,
now at 3-10, present ample evi-
dence for it.

West Virgina simply overpow-
ered the cagers Wednesday night,
fast-«breaking to a 102-78 win.
Tomorrow night in New York, it
will be St._John’s turn to try to
fatten their ﬁne record at the
cagers’ expense.

Last year, the Redmen .coasted
to a 75-51 victory behind the
scoring of Ken McIntyre and
Sonny Dove. McIntyre has grad-
uated but Dove has led the-
the Johnnies to an 11-1 mark_ so
far this season.

Panther. coach Bob Timmons
said of St. John’s, “It'll be a
tough g'ame.for us,” and then
he smiled, “but we have to show
up for it.”

Actually in Tirmnons’ view, St.-
John’s can be no better than
West Virginia. “Carl Head, Dave
Reaser and Ron ,Wil.liams are
three ballplayers as good as we’ll
see anywhere,” he said.

“Everytime we let Head or
Reaser get inside it was two
points for them,” marveled Tim-

mons. Reaser’ scored 34 points
and Head chipped in 28 to pace
the Mountaineer attack. Williams
seemed content to spark WVU’s
fast-break downcourt, but he still
contributed 18.

Twenty of Reaser’s points came
in the ﬁrst half when West Vir-
ginia built up an insurmountable
53-31 lead.

“It was the men against the
boys,” was the ﬁrst thing Tim-
mons said after the game. He
added, “If We could play their
second team, it would be an even
game. “They’re good,” he con-
tinued. “They had too much and
we had too little.” A

Ironically, the scoring statis-
tics indicate that the Panthers
played one of their better ball
games. They shot 50.7 per cent
from the ﬁeld as compared to the
Mountaineers’ 31.6 per cent. And
the 78 points the cagers piled up
represents their high for the
year. _ 

West Virginia had only three
more ﬁeld goals but it was a
different story from the foul line.
There WVU” sank 32 of 45 free

throws to a mere 14 of 25 for
the cagers.

"We were trying not to foul,”
said Timmons, shaking his head.
“We were laying back, picking
up their forwards, and still we’d
get called.

“I think we showed a little

' spark, a‘ little spirit anyway,” he
a d d e d .  “Sylvester Stevenson’s
getting into shape. He played a
game for us.”

Stevenson scored 14 points on
six of 10 from the floor, plus he
had the -unenviaible task of guard-
ing Williams throughout the
game.
