Fraternity flipsfor penny-pinhing pancakes

Delta Chi fraternity makes $2 all—you—ca'n-eat
pancakes every Thursday night for a cause

Natalie Bigley
For The Pitt News

Every Thursday, some of the
guys in Delta Chi fraternity sit
down for dinner. However, it’s
not the usual meal of meat and
potatoes. .

Instead, the guys enjoy break-
fast in the evening, drowning
themselves in an ocean of maple
syrup and a bottomless stack of
pancakes.

You don’t have to be greek to
get a taste of Mrs. Butterworth
on your plate at Delta Chi’s Un-
limited Pancake Thursdays. The
brothers invite everyone, and
the all—you—can—eat pancakes cost
$2. They also sell hot chocolate
for 25 cents and two hashbrowns
for a dollar.

Ben Minkoff, a senior in Delta
Chi, said the pancake donation is
a delicious investment.

“You can’t beat that price
in today’s failing economy,” he
said.

The endless pancake idea
started about a year ago with a
suggestion from Eddie Hujber,
now a Pitt senior and member
of Delta Chi. The idea came to
him one day when he ‘realized
how cheap and easy it was to
make pancakes. Combining those
ideas with his love of cooking,
he thought, would be the start
ofa new tradition, and so began
unlimited pancake night.

An aroma of maple syrup lin-
gers in the air at the Delta Chi
house on pancake night. More
than 40 showed up at last night’s
event — brothers as well as so-

rority members and non-Greeks,
all craving a breakfast fix.

The house is animated with
hungry people, but the action
takes place in the kitchen. Ben
is in charge of the griddles while
Eddie, the Chef Boyardee of the
Delta Chi house, mixes the bat-
ter and flips the pancakes. He
estimated that the fraternity uses
about a half gallon of syrup and
ﬁve pounds of pancake mix every
Thursday.

The guys toss the pancakes
high into the air with precision.
Senior Dari Thomas said that one
night, Eddie tossed a pancake
across the room, giving someone
an opportunity to catch it with
their plate.

Eddie has developed a‘ tech-
nique for the perfect pancake.

“Much ofit is a trade secret,”
Eddie said. “We employ the dou-
ble flip technique to cook each
side twice to make sure it’s crispy
on the outside but well done in
the middle.”

Technique is important, but
the brothers view making pan-
cakes as an art. They cook stan-
dard circular pancakes, but Ed-
die said he and Ben have made
giraffes, a snowman and Mickey
Mouse in the past, among other
creatures. Once, Ben used his
creative genius to make a pan-
cake in the shape of a hydrogen
atom, complete with orbitals.

But if enjoying animal-shaped
pancakes is not enough, there’s
more. Pancake eaters are en-
couraged to BYOT —— bring your
own toppings. Ben said as long
as it’s logistically possible, it can

V (and will) be put into a pancake.

Health care legislation and young people

Local experts say new health care laws might not affect college students until they graduate — but the extent remains unknown

Julie Percha
Contributing Editor

Local policy experts say a new
plan to overhaul the United
States’ health care system will
probably have little effect on stu-
dents until they graduate.

After nearly four months
of ﬂoor debate, H.R. 3962, or
the Affordable Health Care for
America Act, squeaked by the
House with a narrow 220-215
vote on Saturday , sending the
bill to the Senate and kicking po-
tential health insurance reform
into action.

Among the bill’s largest pro-
posals is the requirement for all
Americans to purchase health
insurance —— a provision which
could leave young people hurting
for coverage.

“When this mandate of ‘ev-
eryone must buy insurance’ hits,
then people who just recently
graduated  will be required to
purchase insurance, even if you

P don’t have a job,” said Beaufort

Longest, director of Pitt’s Health
Policy Institute at the graduate
school of public health. “It’s
tough.”

Young people historically ac-
count for the highest percentage

Because this age group in-
cludes recent graduates - who
tend to not have high incomes,
let alone stable jobs — the effect
of the government-mandated.in-
surance would have a dispropor-
tionate impact on young people,

students, won’t be particularly
affected,” Longest said, adding
that the bill could actually in-
crease student access to health
care options. '

The passed House bill includes
a provision that would allow stu-

Well, it’s 2,000 pages, so there’s a lot of other provisions, and [it’s]

probably impossible to say what they all are.

of uninsured Americans.’Accord—
ing to The New York Times, 30
percent of people ages 19-24
did not have health insurance
in 2007, while 26 percent of
Americans aged 25-34 were un-
insured.

 ﬁx  ,        $23:

Longest said._

But while the proposed legis-
lation would force new graduates
to purchase insurance, the bill
as written would have a minimal
impact on students. 7 '

“Students, while they are

    

dents to remain on their parents’
health care insurance plans until
age 26, thereby extending the age
of coverage. A similar version of
the bill proposed in the Senate
would extend dependency cover-
age to age 27.

Currently, UPMC offers stu-
dent health insurance options
to Pitt students whose parents’
insurance plans do not provide
dependency coverage.

The plans — which are of-
fered exclusively to, full-time
Pitt students — allow students
coverage for “extensive medical
treatment or emergency care”
that is not covered by the Pitt
Student Health Fee, according
to the UPMC website.

The annual premiums for
the 2009-10 academic year cost
$1,318.32 for full—time Pitt stu-
dents, and the plan allows access
to both UPMC physicians and
out-of-network providers.

UPMC spokesman Jeffrey
Nelson said he isn’t sure how the
proposed Congressional legisla-
tion would affect student health
care plans.

“It is certainly too early to
know exactly what will happen
with health care reform, and
we would not want to speculate

Pancake eating    
record up for grabs  

House record stands at 22 pancakes eaten in one sitting

Pancakes 4 2

They’ve used M&M’s, fruit and candy bars.

Chocolate chips can be added for-free.

“Pancakes are more or less the great-
est invention of God — God’s magnum
opus,” Eddie said. “Every time you bite
into pancakes, they remind you of mom’s
pancakes.”

For one brother, this feeling hits very
close to home. Pancake eating has become
his forte and claim to fame.

King, likes his pancakes with chocolate
chips and soaked in syrup. He also must
have ketchup on his hash browns.
“People are afraid of the ketchup and
syrup mix, but it’s like a combination of
sweet and salty,” Dan said. “I’ve always put
weird things on my breakfast foods.” —
Despite charging $2 per person, Eddie
said the house makes money fromﬂthe pan~
cakes. It’s nice to make a proﬁt, he said.

Last February, junior Rob Hackett set a
record of eating the most-pancakes inone
sitting. The 6—foot-2 pancake destroyer
ate 20 whole pancakes and recently broke
his own record by eating 22. Brother Matt

Balsbaugh saidsomeone tries to beat Rob’s ~
record every few weeks, but they don’t '

even get close. v '

As a reward for his efforts, Rob re-
ceived a small’ trophy of a bottle of maple
syrup. _ '

“The first time I set the record, I went
upstairs and laid on my bed and thought
I was going to die. I didn’t know if 'IAwas
going to make it,” he said.

When it comes to pancake personal
preference, each brother has his own way

' to eat them.

Dan, recently crowned Homecoming

V l The proﬁts originally went to buying I

more pancake supplies, but as more people
come, the fraternity mightstart donating
part of its profits to Delta Chi’s national
philanthropy, The V Foundation for Cancer
Research. _ '

But for Ben, pancake night is less about
the money and more about the actual pan-
cake eating. '

“Pancakes are a great way to havea

,,good time, bring people together and

spend a Thursday evening,” he said.
Although Market Central’s annual
Thanksgiving Dinner rivaled Delta Chi’s

pancake nightyesterday, Eddie said he i"

was happy with the turnout. ‘

“Only a fully Thanksgiving feast "can
even have a chance of pulling people away
from unlimited pancakes,” he said. i

about what it eventually will look
like,” he said in an e—mail.

Nevertheless, Nelson said
that UPMC supports insurance
reform measures that would in-
crease quality health care access
to Pitt students.

Because the ﬁnal impact of the
legislation is unknown, he said,
students should follow the bill as
it moves to the Senate. S

“It is in the best interest of
college students, and all Ameri-

..cans, to follow the health care

debate and determine how it will
affect them in the years ahead,”
he said.

The University provides its
own insurance options to its
employees, covering roughly
11,000 — or 90 percent —,— of
its employees, according to the
University Times. ‘ ,

‘ Under the insurance plan,
children of University employees
are also eligible for health plan

coverage, excluding vision and
dental care.

But-while Congress’ health
care legislation is pending, a new
Pennsylvania law — known as
Act 4 —- allows people to stay on
their parents’ health insurance
plans until they turn 30.

,Gov. Ed Rendell said in a state-
ment this summer that this leg-
islation_provides “the answer
to the prayers of parents whose
kids will be graduating from col-
lege and will be kicked off their
health insurance policies because

they’ve reached the maximum.

age.”

Jeanne Stoner, Pitt’s assistant
vice chancellor of federal govern-
ment relations, said that if the
health care reform bill passes the
Senate, it will have little impact
on the University’s insurance
plans.

The ultimate effect of the House legis-

Even with the passage of the House’s

legislation is still pending.

compromise bill would go to the Senate
ﬂoor for a vote. If passed, the bill would
then go to a conference committee, where
a group of representatives and senators
would work to reconcile the House and
Senate bill into one piece of legislation.

The reconciled bill would be present-
ed to both the House and Senate for a
majority vote and, if passed, would go to
President Barack Obama for signature
into law.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-
Nev., said that the bill should be finished
by Christmas, although Senate floor de-
bates have yet to be scheduled, The New
York Times reported. '

Despite the tight time frame, Longest
said he is optimistic of the bill’s passage
in the Senate.

“It’s likely that something will come
out of the Senate, and it will be similar, but
not necessarily the same, as what comes
out of the House,” he said. “[The bill rec-
onciliation process] allows for many views
and opinions to come into play, and that’s
what’sIbeing worked out now.”

In addition to insurance reform, the a

bill calls for health care measures that
would extend coverage and decrease
health care costs.

The House billincludes proposed cuts

to the Medicare program, which could '

generate a $500 billion government sav-
ings over the bill’s 10-year implementa-
tion.
. It offers the much— debated “public op-
tion” of purchasing government-spon-
sored health insurance, and it would also
eliminate insurance discrimination based
on pre-existing conditions — such as
chronic illness — to provide wider access
to health care coverage. 0
While somepprovisions of the bill are
known, Longest said it’s not so simple.
“Well, it’s 2,000 pages, so there’s a
lot of other provisions, and [it’s] prob-
ably impossible to say what they all are,”
he said. V .
While it might be difficult for Senate
Democrats to form a cohesive voting bloc
with their members’ varied opinions of
the bill, Longest said he remains opti-
mistic. ‘ L

“I think the bill would pass -'-— I do,” he i I
‘ said. “We’ve got to get health care costs .

more under control, and everyone is now
starting to recognize this.”

Ever since the ﬁrst Australopith-
ecine ape fell out of a tree and
found he could stand upright,
hominids have looked upward
with a sense of awe and wonder,
and not without a sense of their
own insigniﬁcance. The thousands
of tiny specks we can see in the
sky, and the modern realization

‘ of the countless more that can-

that to those “thousand points of
light,” we are undetectable. .An

us feel lucky.

Andvery, very alone.

This loneliness has led story-
tellers and astronomers to “popu-
late” our universe with all manner

green men” to Keanu Reeves. Mars
especially has attracted great at-

tention. Perceval Lowell staked his
entire reputation on Martian civi-
lization, and the writers of science

Robert Heinlein, Ray Bradbury
and others, make Mars a happen-

However, since Mariner 4 made

Mars, the Vastitas Borealis, might
be the seabed of an ocean that

of the planet. Four billion years

hospitable than Earth at the same
time. Lately, however, life seems
long gone.

Trimble: Don’ t jump for the rebound relationship

In a rebound, be careful of exes, emotional roller coasters and classic shenanigans

 
   

Leah Trimble
For The Pitt News

The ﬁrst date was amazing  din-
ner, a movie and that popcorn
with extra butter. The picnic in
Schenley Park for a second date
made my butterﬂies even worse.
And the third?

It really was a charm watching
the Steelers game with all your
friends. Bring on the fourth, ﬁfth
and sixth. Bring on the lovey,
dovey text messages and phone

calls, e—mails and  pictures of .

you and your ex kissing on Face-
bookl? Wait just one second! ‘

' I thought you told me it’s been
“awhile” since you’ve seen him or
her last. This was taken maybe a
month ago, and that’s giving you
the beneﬁt of the doubt.

This is a common occurrence
among new flings who think they
might have a grasp on the sta-
tus of their new relationship.

On life lessons, teens can be teachers too

One minute you’re in la-la land
thinking that you have found “the
one,” and the next minute, you
realize that maybe you’re just a
rebound. , 7

Rebound relationships hap-
pen all the time for several di-
verse reasons. A break—up ends
a serious relationship, and one
or both parties ﬁnd someone
else to quickly latch onto. Two
people contribute to this com-
mon bond:

The Rebounder

The Rebounder is the person
who recently was dumped or
ended a relationship. They are
using their new-found‘ love as a
distraction to their broken heart,
whether they realize it or not.
Those who “love to be in love”
tend to be the biggest culprits-,
for they can’t fathom living for
one second without a lover. A

In this quickly cultivated new
romance, the rebounder can re-

route their emotions and avoid
pain. It’s a quick ﬁx to a bigger
problem. Who wouldn’t want
to be in love instead of crying
yourself to sleep every night? It’s
understandable.

The problem is that several
of the people who ﬁnd new part-

start to feel empty again. Is this
exactly what you want? Here
come the contradictory opin-
ions about the success of your
new partnership. You can predict
what happens from here.

, Other issues aside, the biggest
predicament is pushingyour hurt

and you’re not special enough to
be able to drag someone along
on your emotional roller coaster
ride. '

You don’t have to go far to learn the importance of expressing your own belief in yourself 5

Carolyn Gerecht
Columnist

  
 

A while back, I wrote a column
enumerating some life lessons I’d
learned from my campers, mostly
8- and 9-year-old girls who taught
me how to laugh at myself, how
to solve problems and how to be
very, very patient.

Now, more than two years lat-
er, my days as a camp counselor
have faded into the past.

I’ve moved onto a job as a youth
group adviser at a local syna-
gogue, working with teenagers
who are much older but not really

any wiser ~— most of the time.-

Sometimes, though, these
teenagers can be as insightful as
the elementary school kids of my
past. (Who would have thought
it possible? I know!) Their dem-
onstrations of compassion, drive
and humor are remarkable," just
like those of their younger coun-
terparts. And they’re wo rth shar-
ing.

For instance, one of the more
popular youth group activities is
an ongoing basketball tourna-
ment. - I

Each week, four teams play_

in two games. Eventually, their
team records will be used to cre-

ate a bracket and then a cham-
pionship game. It isn’t religious
programming, but it’s a chance to
practice what are essentially, but
not exclusively, religious values.
And these teenagers do practice
them.

When one student scored a I

game-winning buzzer—beater one
night — as much to his surprise
as to anyone else’s — no one con-
gratulated him more thoroughly
than his peers.

A week later, at their student
board meeting, one of his friends
interrupted the agenda to retell
the story Sports Center-style -
much to the joy of the tomato—red

My ﬁrstinclination was to be annoyed. Who does
this kid think he is?

student, who listened bashfully.

These teens ﬁnd real happiness .

in each other’s successes and I
admire that. K »

Whereas my elementary camp-
ers taught me to Valuesilliness
and never to take myself too seri-
ously, these high school students
are role models of self-conﬁdence
and drive. .

They take themselves seriously '

enough. They want to be respect-
ed by their family and friends,
and contrary to the stereotype of
their age group '— they want you
to care. i i
That desire is so frank and
honest that it’s endearing. I want
the world to be proud of me, too.
The high school students I work

with teach me to admit that —

and to act on it.

In a discussion group one
morning, one student, inspired

Space bacteria Worthy of study

Kozlowski < 7

tion hammers Mars’ atmosphere_,
which is unprotected by a magnet-
ic ﬁeld. This destroys methane in a
short period of time, so something
would have to be actively produc-
ing methane for us to detect any.

Researchers at the Jet Propul-
sion Labs (JPL) think they have
detected traces of methane in
the Martian atmosphere. This
might just be the result of plan-
etal processes, but it also could
mean bacteria exist deep in the
Martian crust, shielded from the
sun and in residual warmth from
Mars’ cooling core.

A life. However, this research brings

it close to home, and it takes the
idea of extraterrestrials from the
realm of probability to the realm
of possibility.

Of course, thisdoes not mean
that Will Smith will have to ﬂy
planes against gigantic ﬂying
saucers that vaporize the White
House. A civilization 100 light-
years away, which is an extraor-
dinarily generous estimate, just
heard Guglielmo Marconi’s ﬁrst
dots and dashes and probably
aren’t impressed. Imagine our
surprise if they show up in 300

being the only intelligent life out
there. Well, maybe not so intel-
ligent 

Scientiﬁcally, how much evi-
dence is needed to support the
idea of a life form on a particu-
larvworld? We. can’t just say “Oh,
there’s methane, ergo life,” as
that’s not proper science. How-
ever, we are realizing that an
analysis of conditions on a planet -
is not always‘ enough to rule out
life. Bacteria persist in. some of

‘ the most inhospitable climates

imaginable on Earth, outside of
hot water vents, eating hydro-

  We can’t just say ‘Oh, there’s methane, ergo life.’

_Bacteria cannot be cited as
the source of methane, but they
cannot be ruled out, either. This
development is exciting and prob-
lematic at the same time. It’s excit-
ing because it lends credibility to
the obscure ﬁeld of astrobiology.

It also makes the idea of life
"on other moons of the solar sys-
tem sound more plausible, like
Saturn’s moons, Enceladus and
Titan, andJupiter’s moons, Europa
and Ganymede. Now the odds of

life elsewhere in the universe are

overwhelming: There are so many
stars, many that might have plan-
ets, that it is incredibly unlikely
that only Earth" is able to sustain

‘ years to answer the Titanic’s dis-

tress calls.

However, extraterrestrial life,
no matter how primitive, could
have large implications for phi-
losophers and theologians. First,
some people don’t want their chil-
dren to read the ﬁrst sentence of

this article in a public school be-

cause it assumes Darwin was right.
Now ask these folks to swallow
instruction about space aliens in
school — and not in- the form of
science ﬁction. Philosophically, we
will have to come to grips with the
loss of the ﬁnal thing that allows
us to claim a vague importance in
the vastness of -the ﬁrmament: of

gen sulﬁde — and all this under
hundreds of atmospheres of pres-
sure. So how can we conclusively
disprove the existence of life on a
given planet? We can probably rule
out, say, Mercury, and especially
Venus, but when can we rule out
Europa?

No matter how we answer these
questions, one thing is clear. We
will never look at the stars the

same way again. Yet it’s that sense _

of wonder and captivation that
will keep us peering at the sky for
as long as man walks the Earth.

something special is what you re!’
ally desire, think twice, because
you probably won’t find it in a
rebound relationship.

Be careful in this situation.
“Wear the pants,” and don’t give
in to anything other than what
you expect and deserve. If you
keep having insecure thoughts
about the relationship, move on.
Those worries will never cease.

If you ﬁnd yourself in this situ-
ation and the rebounder kicks you
to the curb, you have the right tﬁ
be really upset. You gave the per-
son a chance, even though they
reassured you that their old love
has ended.

If you had no clue that your
partner was recently attached and
he or she dumps you, you have

the right to be irate. Minus the .

few who are upfront about their
situations, why can’t people just
be honest about how they feel?
It’s so much easier to say, “I really
like you, but, I’m not going to lie:
I still have some feelings for my
ex.” It’s that simple. Emotional
catastrophe avoided.

Be honest about your current

situation and how you feel toward _

it. Know that rebound relation-
ships usually don’t work out. For
the few who do survive, congratu-
lations. You’ve overcome the in-
securities, lies and doubts.

And if you haven’t already,
take down those darn pictures
of you and your ex. They’re not
helping your situation.

"Side: Too much for the typical col-
lege kid to aiford on a regular ba-
sis.

Tucked away, in the isolated
depths of the deep south —— South
Oakland, that is —— is a transcen-
dent bar aptly named The Hideout.
At 45 Bates St., behind the decep-
tively discreet’ front _door, lies just
the kind of bar the neighborhood
had previously lacked.

While it’s only been open for a
few weeks, local residents already

“ﬂock to enjoy cheap booze ($1.25 _

for a Miller Lite is as cheap as it gets
in this area), pool tables and one
behemoth dance ﬂoor.

Owner Mark Cook is looking to

. ﬁll a new niche with The Hideout.

When asked how his place differs
from other bars in town, he doesn’t
hold back.

“It’s the biggest  I’ve had
people come back and say it’s the
greatest,” Cook said.

“The bartenders will actually
come and talk to you here. Though
that’s probably just because I’m
standing here,” he said. “It’s doubt-
ﬁil his looming presence is the only

reason, though. The staff is a genu— '

inely friendly bunch, eager to make
conversation with patrons.”
Whitney Camp, a freshman at
Carlow and one of The Hideout’s
bartenders, insists that the place

- has more to offer than anywhere

else in town.

“Here, you get Oakland prices
with a South Side or Station Square
atmosphere,” Camp said.

The best difference, sh_e ex-

plained, is that “when you go to
some Station Square bars, you get
those gross greasy guys up on you.
Here, you can have a girl’s night of
dancing without worrying about
them.” '

The Hideout, which consists of
two bars, a lounge area, a dance
ﬂoor and a private room available
for rent, certainly seems to have
something for everyone.

The Dear Hunter.

S *" With its newest album, Act III.-

Life and Death, and a stop at the

South Side’s Diesel this Sunday, the
band hopes to show Pittsburgh that
it’s better than the average furry-
faced hipsters.

’ Since The Receiving End of
Sirens’s vocalist and multi-instru-

mentalist Casey Crescenzo created
the band in 2005, The Dear Hunter
grew from a demo tape made in the
winter of that year to a sextet that
cracked the Billboard Top 200 in
July of 2oo9.

“It’s nice for our label, family

zo said of tl1is recent success, “[but]
our validation comes from the cre-
ativity in what we do.” '
That creative spirit is what al-
lowed the six-member group to ex-

that might seem out of place to the
average alternative rock fan. From
lighter songs with doo-wop ﬂavor

about touring with new bands.
“Over theyears, we’ve toured
with a lot of the same bands over

becomes like a family after a while.
But on this tour, I thought it was
nice to get out of our comfort zone

“Sometimes ‘people don’t

“2o12”

Starring: John Cusack, Amanda
Peet ‘

Director: Roland Emmerich
Studio: Columbia Pictures

"F NG

According to Roland Emmerich,
the world will end not with a bang,
not with a whimper, but rather with
a screamingjohn Cusack.

Emmerich, the cataclysmic-

minded director behind such _

blockbusters as “Independence
Day” and “The Day After»Tomor-
row,” returns with more of the
same with “2012,” the disaster ﬁlm
to end all disaster ﬁlms.
Unfortunately, taking a front-
row seat to the end of the world

isn’t as exciting as one would
hope.

Cashing in on the Y2K—esque
hoopla surrounding Dec. 21, 2012,
Emmerich molds a lackluster script
around scene after scene of truly
awesome special effects.

When Los Angeles isn’t literally
sinking into the Paciﬁc Ocean, the
ﬁlm’s plot and mediocre character
assortment drag the experience
down.

Opening with a series of scenes
that supposedly explain why the

- world will end on the now-infa— .

mous date in December 2012 -
something silly about neutrinos,
the Mayan calendar and all the
planets aligning —— the ﬁlm then
shifts to triﬂing family scenes
with Cusack as the distant father/
husband and Amanda Peet as his
estranged wife. .

Needless to say, these introduc-
tory scenes are totally perﬁmctory,
and soon enough, the world is liter-
ally imploding and all is right (and
mindless).

The questionable plot focuses

No sane person would buy

Cusack’s “acting.” I can’t thinkof
a more miscast role this ﬁlm sea-

where a miscast role matters so

freedom he has in expressing him-
self with The Dear Hunter.

“Whatever comes out just comes
out,” he said. “I think that’s much
more rewarding than just saying,
‘I’m in a pop—punk band’.”

The album tells an expansive
story that allows Crescenzo to ex-
plore “a large scope of experiences
and emotions.” The Act series —
which plans to span six installments
— represents titular character The
Dear Hunter and his “life from
birth to death and everything in
between,” Crescenzo said.

Admitting to" the seemingly
grandiose nature of such an expan-
sive project, Crescenzo said that/la‘
III is “not excessive, but deﬁnitely
intense.”

This intensity isn’t just some-
thing that exists in the studio‘ for

The Dear Hunter, but also on the ‘

road. Since they are very different,
Crescenzo and the band don’t try to

do exactly the same thing in both H

settings.

“Live is a different kind of ani'—
mal than a record,” Crescenzo said.
“We get a lot out of playing live, and
we hope that the people watching
us do too.”

On~/lot III, other members.of
the group contributed musical ideas
for the album, as well.

“It’s great to have people around
who respect my vision,” he said.

With his eye toward his future,
Crescenzo looks forward to the
holiday season and what lies be-

« yond it. From production work fdl‘

other bands to more work for The
Dear Hunter and even some family
time, he’s got a busy schedule. But
his ambitions — from orchestral
music to long form ﬁlm —— keeps
him exploring more ways of self-
expression. ’

“If I didn’t feel like I had any un-
fulﬁlled ambitions at this point,”

’ he said, “I’d feel like I should give

The Academy Is  tours on bus withfour other bands

Academy 4 10

The Academy Is“... going up the West Coast
and down the East Coast, but Siska says
his favorite city to play in varies from tour
to tour. ' ‘

“One of my favorite cities in the country
is San Francisco, [and] I always have a good
timeat Mr. Small’s in Pittsburgh,” he said.

In—between cities, Siska said the band
worked on its" new EP, Lori in Paciﬁc Time.
Most of the songs were written over the
summer and recorded on the tour bus in
their back lounge.

“There was [only] one song on the EP
out of the ﬁve — that was something we
wrote during the sessions for the last re-
cord. We just never really ﬁnished it, [but]
we kept coming back to it. It’s called ‘New
York (Saint in the City),’” he said.

Aside from getting closer to the group’s
own music, Siska said being on tour allows
him to reconnect with someold favorites.

He said that the “don’t look back mental-
ity” of the music of Bob Dylan, Neil Young,
Tom Wade and others keeps/him sane on

‘tour. Butihis general music taste is very

eclectic. ' -

“I grew up in the Caribbean, so I’m a .

big fanof dub-music, reggae music and all
that stuff is a big part of me. I like classical
music as well, and I listen to a lot of the
old country records like Hank Williams,”

Siska said. “I have a full 120GB iPod, so 

I’m always listening to new things.”
Even though Siska notes-that The Acad-

l emy Is  is a band that takes pride in that

it’s dedicated torbeing a great live band, he
and his band mates are looking forward

to a much—needed break at the end of the .

tour. - '

“Our agenda after this tour is just to take ‘

some time for our personal and musical

growth for a minute and come back and

record an album whenever we’re ready,”
he said. “We don’t want to rush the next
album or feel like there’s any sort of pres-

sure or preconceptions of what the records »
supposed to be. We want our next record

to be our best.”

Lewis still in ‘running’ for national award

Freshman a semi-finalist for the Doak Wa.lkerAwa.'rd,» which is given to the nation’s_ best running back

nalists for the Doak Walker Award,
which is presented annually to the
nation’s top running back.

freshman Ryan Williams is also a
semiﬁnalist. Through nine games,
Lewis has rushed for 1,139 yards
and 12 touchdowns on‘203 car-
ries. Lewis also has- one receiving
touchdown. -.

Lewis matched Tony Dorsett’s
Pitt record of rushing for 1,000
yards as a freshman in just eight
games. The NCAA record is seven
games, achieved by only ﬁve play-
ers. .
Last week, Lewis was named a
semiﬁnalist for the Maxwell Award

for the college football player of the 9 R

year.
Three ﬁnalists for the award
will be announced on Nov. 23. The

New -look Panthers start year with Wofford

Ben Duignan
Stajf Writer

When the Elite Eight banner is
raised just before tonight’s regu-
lar season opener for the men’s
basketball team against Wofford
College, the players and fans will
have a moment to remember last
season’s successes.

But after the lights have ﬁn-
ished shining on the banner in the
rafters, they will quickly shift their
attention to center court. ’

Sam Young, Levance Fields and
Tyrell Biggs, all senior starters,

are gone. Co-Big East player of the
year Dejuan Blair left early for the
NBA. ‘

This year, there are no proven
leaders. The two seniors on the
team, Jermaine Dixon and Chase
Adams, have a combined one
year of Big East playing‘experi-
ence. Pitt’s lineup wo"n’t feature
one starter from a year ago, as

Dixon is still recovering from a" r

broken foot.

Nevertheless, Pitt coachjamie
Dixon believes the expectations for
this year’s team are no different.

“Our challenge is always to be
the best team we can be,” Dixon

 

We decide how good we’re going to be.

It’s not our youth or it’s not how we’re

picked to ﬁnish.

Jamie Dixon,

said. “We decide how good we’re
going to be. It’s not our youth or
it’s not how we’re picked to ﬁn-
ish.”.  «

One of the challenges every
team encounters is ﬁnding a lead-
er. That leader has to emerge, and
this year’s team has two players
ready to do just that.

Junior Brad Wanamaker and
sophomore Ashton Gibbs are em-
bracing the leadership role.

“I consider myself one of the
main leaders on this team,” Wa-
namaker said. “I want the team to
go as I go. [Coach Dixon] tells me
that ifl get going early, the team
will follow my lead.”

Currently, Gibbs is the only
active Panther that has started a
game for Pitt. 4 l

“I consider myself a leader. Be-
ing a point guard, you want to be a
leader, and [Coach Dixon] stresses
it,” Gibbs said.

The Wofford College Terriers

enter the 2009-10 season return-
ing all ﬁve starters from a year ago,
and they are coming off their most
successful season since joining the
Southernconference in 1997, go-
ing 16-13.

Wofford is led by two veteran
scorers, junior forward Noah
Dahlman and senior guardjunior
Salters. Dahlman led the team in
scoring with 17.8 points per con-
test, while Salters tallied 15 points
per game a year ago. Both players
were in the top ﬁve in scoring in
the Southern Conference.

“They’re a very good team,
they’re very experienced,” Gibbs
said. “They have some good shoot-
ers, some good attackers and some
big men as well. They’re very ver-
satile.” '

Pitt will have to counter Wof-
f0rd’s dynamic offense with solid
defensive ball pressure. After los-
ing four of its top ﬁve scorers from
a year ago, Pitt will need improved

defensive play in 2009.

“We’ve got to ﬁnd different
ways to win this year, and this year;
it’s going to be about how we play
defense,” Wanamaker said.

The Panthers will oppose Wof-
ford’s veteran squad with a young
starting lineup. Wanamaker, Gibbs,
sophomore Nasir Robinson, junior
Gary McGhee and redshirt freslﬁ
man Travon Woodall are the likely
starters for Pitt, as they started
both of Pitt’s exhibition games.

Pitt will embark on the 2009-
10 campaign with a lower rank-
ing than it had heading into lasg

_ year, but expectations remain the

same. Dixon thinks this team has
potential to live up to those ex-
pectations.

“I have conﬁdence in this group
in where they’re going to be,”
said Dixon. “I’m very impresse
with what they’ve done and what
they’ve committed themselves to
doing.”

To beat Irish, Pitt must overcome history

Greg Trietley
Staﬂ’Wri ter

itt climbed to No. 8 in tl1eAP
Top 25 this week, but don’t
tell that to Dave Wannstedt.

“It doesn’t have any bearing on
anything that we have to do Satur-
day,” Wannstedt said. “It’s a nice re-
ward for [our players], but we’ve got
three games left.”

Nonetheless, asthe regularseason
nears its close, Pitt will try to keep its
highest BCS ranking in school his-
tory when Notre Dame (6-3) squares
off against the Warmstedt’s Panthers
(8-1, 5-0 Big East) Saturday night.

Pitt hasn’t defeated Notre Dame
at home since 1999.

The Fighting Irish enter Heinz

Field with one of this season’s top .

quarterbacks at the helm, juniorJim-
my Clausen. Clausen has 20 touch-
down passes and just three intercep-
tions this season.

“Clausen is playing as good as any
quarterback around,” Wannstedt
said. “There are no holes in this guy.”

Much of the Fighting Irish’s of-
fense comes from the connection
of Clausen to wide receiver Golden
Tate, whose 10 touchdowns this sea-
son put him in a ﬁve-way tie for sec-
ond in the nation — along with Pitt’s
Dorin Dickerson and three others.

Warmstedt praised the junior
wide receiver’s toughness.

“Without a doubt, Golden is the
best player that we have faced,”
Wannstedt said. “This guy is excep-
tional at catching the ball, exception-
al at making guys miss.”

Notre Dame will disappoint far1s

looking for another Pitt opponent to '

run the wildcat formation on offense.
Unlike South Florida and Syracuse,
the Fighting Irish do not utilize the
quarterback in the running game,
Wannstedt said. Clausen has nega-
tive rushing yards on the season.
“Their run game is very similar to
ours,” Wannstedt said. “They’re go-
ing to run the power, the toss. They

aren’t going to be one of those teams
that run the quarterback a lot.”
Notre Dame starting running
back Armando Allen, who averages
4.9 yards per carry, is expected to re-
turn to action against Pitt after miss-
ing two games with an ankle injury.

Meanwhile, Pitt’s offense contin-
ues to click ‘under offensive coordi-
nator Frank Cignetti. Last weekend’s
37-10 win over Syracuse marked
Dion Lewis’ fourth straight 100—yard
rushing performance and Bill Stull’s
ninth straight game with a passing

touchdown.

The maturation on the other
side of the ball, though, impressed
Wannstedt the most. Pitt gave up 500
yards of offense in each game against
North Carolina State and Buffalo in
September, but now leads the Big

 is S East in total defense.

“We’ve settled in a bit more as
the year has gone on, defensively,”
Wannstedt said. “I think our players
have a little bit more conﬁdence.”

Wannstedt wants to mind tum-

» overs against Notre Dame. The Fight-

ing Irish have forced 17 of them this
season, and senior safety Kyle Mc-
Carthy has ﬁve interceptions alone
this year.

“They try to create bad plays, neg-
ative plays,” Wannstedt said. “With
the skill that they have on defense,

i = particularly in their secondary with

some of the speed and experience
they have back there, they can latch
on to receivers and give you a lot of
bad plays.”

The Fighting Irish lost to Navy
last week, 23-21, and fell outside the
AP Top 25 as a result. Wannstedt said
Notre Dame will come out looking
for redemption.

“I’m expecting that we are going
to be getting an angry, tough, hun-
gry, football team in here on Satur-
day night,” Wannstedt said. “When
you’re dealing with good coaches,
and you’re dealing with good players
and high character people, and you
have a setback, you better be expect-
ing their best effort”

A much—anticipated matchup,
ABC will nationally televise the
game Saturday night. In addition,
Pittsburgh mayor Luke Ravenstahl
declared Friday “Tum It Blue Day”
to rally up fan support for the game.
Those in attendance are once again
encouraged to wear Pitt navy blue.

The game is the ﬁrst time Pitt has
sold-out Heinz Field since its game
againstwestvirginialastyear. Before
that, Pitt last sold out the stadium in
2005, when it hosted Notre Dame.

Still, Wannstedt reminded his
players that the off-ﬁeld hype won’t
matter come game time.

“We’re going to keep our feet on
the ground,” Wannstedt said. “It’s not
going to be the people in the stands.
It’s not going to be the TV people. It’s
going to come down to blocking and
tackling.”

Itwas the longest game played inthe his-

“Playing in Notre Dame Stadium was surreal

and to beat them the way we did was like a

storybook ending.”

The Panthers entered the game 6—2,b1it
had just suffered a disappointing loss to Rut-
gerstheweekbefore inPittsburgh.Thiswould
become acareergamefor senior placekicker
Conor Lee, andbothteams set school records
in a dramatic, quadruple—overtime battle.

“It was surreal,” Lee recalled. “You grow
up hearing about Notre Dame as a kid, espe-
cially with my parents, and you know how
big of a national power they are. Playing in
Notre Dame Stadiumwas surreal and to beat
them the way we did was like a storybook
ending,”

Following the Rutgers loss, Notre Dame
didn’t make things any easier for Pitt as two

second-quarterjimmy Clausen touchdown "

Fighting Irish up 17-3 at halftime.

Butthe Panthers fought back and tied the
game at 24-24lateinthefourth quarcerto send
the game into overtime —- four overtimes to
be exact.

The overtimeperiods were ground battles,
asbothnmningbacks inchedtheirteams clos-
er to an elusive touchdown. Lee and Notre
Dame kicker Brandon Walker kicked back
and forth until Walker failed to convert on a
38-yard ﬁeld goal.

' The victory markedthe Panthers second
wininNotre Dame since 1986,withthe other
win occuring four  prior in the 2004
matchup.

Any victory over the Fighting Irish is irn—
portant to the Panthers, but at 6-2, the Pan-
thers were desperate for anotherwin.

The season before, the Panthers jumped
out to a 6-1 record, but lost  consecutive
games and failed to earn aBowl invite.

“Wewantedtowinandwehadtowin,”
Lee said. “Plus we were playing Notre Dame
 and we were really anxious to get that sev-

n 2006, the Panthers and Fighting
Irish agreed to an eight-game, 10-year
