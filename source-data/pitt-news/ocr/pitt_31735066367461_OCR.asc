Annual Greek Week Program

Features ‘The Brothers"Four’
The University’s annual Greek Week will be held this

year from Feb. 13 to 18.

Co-chairman Ron.Miller- commented: “We feel very con-
ﬁdentthat this year’s Greek Week program will be extreme-
ly successful because of the cooperation shown by fraterni-

ties and sororities.
“The biggest change in this

year’s program is the appearance V

of the “Brothers Four,” a group
that is noted "for singing folk
songs. I also think the entire pro-
gram will be more meaningful be-
cause of the emphasis being plac-
ed on the Saturday workshops.”

The Queen’s Contest and the

selection of the Court Jester will
be held on Mon. Feb. 13. A chapel
and basketball game is scheduled
for Tuesday while Wednesday is
an open day.

The Brothers Four concert and
Exchange Dinners will be held
on Thursday and a Greek sing

scheduled for Friday will end the

week.

Saturday will be‘ devoted to
work shops, Fun Day, and as a
ﬁnale, the Greek Week Dance.

The Queen will be chosen on
the basis of her performance in
the contest from a standpointnof
originality, ability and poise. She

will be crowned’ Monday night.

Each fraternity may enter a
nominee for the post of Court.

Statement Supports Freedom of Speech

Students Sponsor Colodny Petition

A student-sponsored petition
protesting the recent attacks on
Dr. Robert G. Colodny is being
circulated on campus.

Ronald Caplan, Arts, soph, and
others whose names have not
been released at this writing, have
expanded an original letter to the
Chancellor into a public petition
for the defense of Colodny’-s free-
dom of speech.

Five copies of the statement are
in circulation in. the main build-
ings of the University. The peti-
tion readsyas folows.

 

“Dear Chancellor Litchﬁeld:

“We, the undersigned, members
of student body at the University
of Pittsburgh, subscribe to the
following:

_ “l. That Professor Robert G.
Colodny be retained as Professor
of History at the University of
Pittsburgh, in spite of his opin-
ions on the present Cuban contro-
versy, in spite of his past affilia-
tions,“ whatever they may have
been, and in spite of pressures
from individuals and factions out-
side the University community to

,’t_

    

“2. That the decision to re-
tain Dr. Colodny as a faculty
member of the University of
Pittsburgh be clearly the result
of a ﬁrm insistence on the part
of the University that any fac-
lllty member here has the right
to think as he wishes and say
what he wishes to whom and
whenever he wishes, just as any
American has this same right.
“3. That we would find odious,

intolerable and morally invalid

l have him dismissed.

‘Ideas & Figures’ to Feature
3 New Departments in Spring

“Ideas & Figures," a magazine
of the liberal arts, will have three
new departments in the Spring is-
sue, William Bennett, editor, said
today.

The program of “Ideas & Fig-
ures" covers a far wider ﬁeld than
a “literary magazine,” Bennett ex-
plained. In the past the student
publication has had, in’ addition to
student fiction, poetry and reviews,
photographic r e p r oductions of
sculpture, drawings and other ex-
amples of the graphic arts; drama,
and articles on music and philoso-
phy.

‘To expand even further the
scope of Ideas & Figures, there
have been instituted three new

“Ideas & Figures” hopes to pub-
lish photography in the future.
Any type of photography is being
solicited.

A third new department in the
magazine is poetry in foreign lan-
guages; new translations of for-
eign poems as well as original po-
ems written in languages other
than English with an accompany-
ing English translation.

“Ideas & Figures” exists to
provide an outlet for talented
and interested students. “I’m
certain that there are talented
people in the University who
haven't shown themselves,” the
editor commented. He added
that interest in the magazine has
been very low so far.

own opinions, no matter what
they are, run ‘counter to popular
opinion; that we believe that such
actions subvert both academic
ideals and the ideals upon which
this nation was founded and upon
which it allegedly functions to-

Ex-Campus Cop Tells 1111!

Keeping college students under control can be a tough,

is Captain Tom Creamer -— ex-chief of police at a large
university. In his long career, he’s handled everything
from outrageous pranks to some of the biggest riots in

In this week’s Saturday Evening Post, Captain Creamer
tells how he matched wits with students. You’ll learn
‘ how a famous actor once led a wild fist and ﬁre-hose

8,000 Management Opportunities!

That’s right. There will be 8,000 supervisory
jobs filled from within the \Vestern Electric
Company by college graduates in just the next
ten years! How come? Because therc’s the
kind of upward movement at VVestcrn Electric
that spells execzztive opportunity. Young men
in engineering and other profession-.11 work can
choose between two paths of atlvancernent-
one within their own technical ﬁeld and one
within over-all management.

Your progress up-the-ladder to executive
positions will be aided by a number of special
programs. The annual company-wide person-
nel survey helps select management prospects.
This ties in with planned rotational develop-
ment, including transfers between Bell Com-
panies and experience in a wide variety of
ﬁelds. VVestern Electric maintains its own full-
time graduate engineering training program,
seven formal management courses, and a tui-
tion refund plan for college study.

After joining Western Electric, you’ll be
planning production of a steady stream of

communications products-—clectronic switch-
ing, carrier, microwave and missile guidance
systems and components such as transistors,
diodes, ferrites, etc. Every day, engineers at
our manufacturing plants are xvorking to bring
new developments of our associates at Bell
Telephone Laboratories into practical reality.
In short, “the sky’s your limit” at Western
Electric.

Opportunities exist for electrical, mechanical, indus-
trial, civil and chemical engineers, as well as physical
science, liberal arts, and business majors. For more
information, go! your copy of Consider a Career at
Western Electric from your’ Placement Officer. Or write

0n Freedom

Follow-the-leader is a game that children play, but
some even play it when they getolder. ‘

[The Pittsburgh chapter of the American Association
of University Professors issueda statement last week in
which they stated they would defend any professor, re-
gardless of his associations, against any attack upon his
expression of ideas, from whatever source and however
unpopular these ideas maybe.

Some students are now sponsoring a petition protest-
ing the recent attack on Dr. "Robert G. Colodny. In signing
it a student agrees that any faculty member has the right
to think as he wishes and say what he wishes to whomever
and whenever he wishes, just as any American has this
same right.

Since freedom of the press andfreedom of speech
should be equal, then Mr. William Gill of the Pittsburgh

Press is free also to write anything he wants. If this is true, _

then what right has anyone to criticize the news story he
wrote concerning Dr. Colodny.

‘Wedo not believe he has this right, however, because
we believe that every freedom’ has a boundary. When one
does harm to another individual, as Mr. Gill has. done to
Dr. Colodny, then he has stepped beyond this boundary.

We, therefore, cannot sanction a freedom of speech
that hasno boundaries, even if we feel that we may have
been unjustly chastised. If individuals outside of this Uni-
versity believe that University instructors are harming
students by the way they are instructing them, then we are
stepping beyond the boundary of freedom of speech if we
qdogmatically assert that our University should have no
boundaries; that we should not be subject to criticism
when there is doubt. ,

The AAUP’s statement and the exaggerated and elabo-
rated follow-up statement of the student petitioners fail
to live up to the academic idealsthat our University pur-
ports to have. These groups have assumed a god-like author-
ity in deciding what academic ideals and processes are.

It is disheartening to us to ﬁnd that the majority, of
students to whom we talk and- who gave us quotes last
week so ﬁrmly believe in this irrational concept/of com-
plete freedom of speech.

This freedomcannot exist anywhere, even in a uni-
versity. Chancellor Litchﬁeld’.s policy of investigating the
University is the only solution to the present accusations of
the state assembly. In following this policy we can prove
that our instructors are not teaching material that will
harm anyone and at the same time we will prove to the
public that we know what academic freedom is.

An ’ANif.erati§fe ‘Effort 

A Social Problem

By Maﬂhew Nesvisky

People in the Tuck Shop are persistently pre-
arranged into two particular portions: patrons and
parasites. _

Patrons are primarily people who presume that
a public eating place is where prepared and pre-
heated products are to be pur-
chased. Their perspicacity is
perfect. Parasites are pests who
prance from patron to patron,
pedantically popping with point-
less patter while probably
pocketing peanuts or pilfering
particles of pretzels from their
poor prey, Their penny-pinch-
ing presence is poignantly un-
pleasant. Period.

Some of these social slobs
seem to have no sense of sagac-
ity. As soon as they spy some unsuspecting student
who has simply stopped in to satisfy the stirrings
of his starving stomach, these sickening blood-
suckers strike. Sparkling with a “Such-a-long-
time-since-I’ve-seen-you” style salutation, the
social skunk‘ simultaneously starts snitching sec-
tions of sandwiches. The simple sucker is solidly
stymied; certain to ‘simmer in a sorrowful-state.
For sure, he is too civilized to/snarl or snap at
his psychotic seat-mate.

"C" Them There

Capriciously copping coke or candy, our con-
niving clod clatters consistently: calm, cool, but
quick conversation concerning college, calories,
creepy chemistry courses, clothes, cars, classes and
Mr. Clean, and concluding with a close-up of /the

his captive classmates to crave crawling into. the

concern on their coffee-cup.

Lickety-split, the lecherous leech is leaping
away, leaving his luncher who lugubriously lowers
his leadened eye-lids and languishes limply for
Litchﬁeld to levy some law to make the likes of
this lackadaisical loon illegal. But our limoculous
loon lightly laughs. Leering ludicrously he levels
off, looking over the lay of the land for the next
likely loser.‘-

I guess you will agree when I grant that a
great many of these garrulous gabbers are girls.
Gawking and gossiping, a gang will go galloping
into a group which has gathered for gastronomical
Grandly gregarious, a gauche gasbag
giggles grandiose greetings and gets glazed gazes
of grief in return. The good gals give in glumly
to the gallons of gushing, garbagey gossip of this
gross go-getter. “Great God, if only this glutton-
ous growth would go!” they grumble and groan,
glimpsing their “guest” as she grabs her ungiven
gifts and gobbles the graft of her craft.

Evil as this egotistical Epicurean is, everyone

is evidently too easy-going to entreat him to end »

his energetic eating, elbowing and ear-bending.

A Even the most educated are ensnared when the

problem of ejecting hi_m from our ediﬁce enters.
The enigma of engineering an effective egress is
enticing, but equally esoteric. Everyone’s effort

our Emperor of Ego eludes extradition.

Much has been made of the mode of this
moocher whose monstrous manners mystify most
men, but mainly, most maintain that this mirthful,
masticating microcephalic makes a mockery of
the mores and manners of modern man. More-
over, maniacal or merciless, mad or merely mer-
cenary, the multitude must maintain a marvelous
method to his madness.

Letters to the Editor

Professor Quest-ions
‘Freedom of Press’

Editor, The Pitt News:

The position taken by The
Pittsburgh" Press and Rep. Walsh
in the Colodny case raise some
rather basic issues which may
not have been realized even by
themselves.

Apparently the Press and Rep.
Walsh take the position that
while Prof. Colodny may have
a constitutional right to his own
opinions as a private citizen, in
“the sensitive position of teach-
ing young people” he should be
ﬁred unless he is able and will-
ing to' “see ‘facts whole and
straight” — as the_Press sees

them.

I wonder if the Press would
be willing to apply the same
principle to newspapers, which
hold another very “sensitive”
position in a democratic society.
For the average citizen, a single
daily newspaper often, in prac-
tice, provides the only source of

information upon which he bases '
‘ his “public opinion” which is so

important in determining public
policy. .

Should an editor -— or a re-
porter—be ﬁred whenever he
fails to present the facts “whole
and straight”—perhaps according

to some university professor (or.

legislator) who is an expert in
that ﬁeld?
Would the Press reject this

_ sort of censorship .. as an un-

warranted invasion of “freedom
of the press,” pointing out that
alternative .‘sources of informa-

'tion are available to the reader

who will. merely take the time

_and trouble to look for them?

Then is not the same thing
even more true of a college pro-

fessor? In college, a student is,

exposed to a great many points

of view. If he isiso stupid as to V

 

swallow whole the opinions of
any one professor without mak-
ing an effort to weight them
against other points of view, he
is "hardly worthy of a college
education.

Pitt is indeed fortunate in hav-
ing a Chancellor who believes so
strongly in the principle of aca-
demic freedom. This will un-
doubtedly be an important factor
in making’Pitt “one of the na-
tion’s great universities.”

Bennett's ' Thoughts

Criticized by Reader

Editor, The Pitt News:

Mr-. William Bennett’s state-
ments on “The Crux of Idealogy”
were illogical and based on false
premises. Mr. Bennett’s com-
ments on liberalism, conserva-
tism, and apathy were based on
an untruthful assertion; name-
ly, that old men are apathetic
to enthusiastic movements.

He stated that most idealogies
have their founders in young

‘men, naming such liberals as

Lenin, Hitler, Christ, and Con-
fucius. He then used William F.
Buckley as his example of a
young conservative, to prove his
point that liberals and conserva-
tives are found among youths.
His use of two older men, Josef
Stalin and William Jennings
Bryan, do not prove his main
point that old men are apathetic.
Mr. Bennett used only one ex-
ample of a young conservative
to two examples of older men
who were not apathetic, which
seems to disprove his point by
the very number of examples.
Mr. Bennett’s remarks about
Christianity are completely un-

true and unfounded. Stating that

Christianity neglects the basic

 

»«. j.’.. .- :. 14,;-has Iéw.-...,,;.r.~,‘,’*-3,," -L..." .  ~  .‘~?‘:‘

reality that not every human

- moral code can conform with the
the \"

Ten Commandments and
Beatitudes, Mr. Bennett fails to
realize that the Sacrament of
Penance in the Catholic and
Orthodox Churches, and various

‘confession prayers used by Pro-

testant denominations are un-
deniable proofs that Christianity
does recognize man’s failings.
Mr. Bennett, using as his ex-
ample of Chris-tianity’s failure
to realize that not every human
moral code can conform to the
Ten Commandments and the
Beatitudes, states that “God’s
Kingdom on Earth becomes

 

I

~..»

Catholic Spain of the bestial-In- ,

quisition.” This statement again
illustrates illogical thinking, as
the Inquisition did not judge on
‘morals,’ but on ‘Church doc-
trine.’  .
Such a reference as “Catholic
Spain of the bestial Inquisition,”
only reflects a bitter tinge of
bigotry in the author. In short,
Mr. Bennett should labor at
greater length to make what
should be obvious historical

points.

Woodrow Wilson once stated,
“Justice has nothing to do with

Writer Wants To
Hear Both Sides

Editor, The Pitt News:

ram writing this letter in the
hope that it will encourage those
who are responsible for schedul-
ing our extra-curricular lectures
to present a wider range of poli-
tical thought; more speciﬁcally,
conservative political thought.

In the past, whenever anyone
at the University has had the
audacity to suggest such heresy,
he has apparently been dismissed
as a member of a small but fana-
tical band of hard—core Gold-
waterites. I hope that the atten-
dance and the enthusiasm dis-
played at the recent lecture giv-
en by William F. Buckley has
ﬁnally dispelled this fallacy.

Although it had to be given
at 8:30
speech by an avowed conserva-
tive was attended by a standing-
room-only audience composed
largely of avowed liberals (my-
self included). Consequently,
much of the enthusiasm display-
ed, especially during the ques-
tion period, was hostile to Mr.
Buckley.

But what of it? The important
thing is that this was the ﬁrst
time that many of us had had
the opportunity to see a real live
conservative spokesman on cam-
pus. I for one would like to see
more of them; even in the day-
time if this is not asking too
much.

Certainly an institution which

in the evening, this

has so recently declared its de- .
“academic freedom”-

votion to
should give some concern to the
academic freedoms of its stu-
dents—the freedom to‘ hear both
sides of the story.

Colodny Defense

Receives Praise

Editor, The Pitt News:

Congratulations on your stand
taken in the defense of Dr. Co-
lodny. You and those in a sim-
ilar position are the bulwark
against the onrushing tide of fear
which threatens to engulf our
nation.

Keep up the good fight for
freedom and justice, and please,
carry on these high ideals on
into your adult life. We all need
someone to look to for moral
support.

Cleland Slates

Views on New

Administration 

By KATHY GRANT

At the same moment that

John F. Kennedy was being

sworn in as President of the; .

United States, Dr. Hugh 
Cleland, assistant professor;

of history, was presenting
his expectations of the coming ad-
ministration.

Dr. Cleland began his predic-
tions by asking the question “What
is Kennedy?” Answering the
question himself, he said that.
Kennedy represented the man who
could win back the votes of the
middleuclass Catholics who had
moved to the suburbs, prospered,
and became Republicans.

His family life, asserted Dr.
Clelenc‘, also played an important
part in his campaign. The attrac-
tive Kennedy family life is par-
allel to that of a European royal
family.

It appeals psychologically to the
dull lives of the masses, he said.

In America, Hollywood substi-
tuted for this effect until recently
when the trend shifted to the po-
litical scene.

Promises Good

Dr. Cleland also discussed sev-
eral aspects of Kennedy’s plat-
form: “The promises for Civil
Rights were good during the cam-
paign.” But he added “I think a
party who was serious about Civil
Rights would have appointed a
Republican to the office of At-
torney General.”

The history professor feels
that one-half of the campaign
promises will come about.

He also noted that in the top
three cabinet posts, the Secre-
taries of State, Defense and the
Treasury, two are Republicans.

Kennedy’s failure to appoint

Luther Hodges, a labor leader, to
a post which had been promised

(to him, does not favor the labor
;movement, according to Dr. Cle-
5 land.

Hodges was instead given the
ambassadorship to New Zealand.
No New Frontiers

In summing up his talk, Dr.
Cleland stated that there are
really no new frontiers to con-
quer. Instead, he said, there are
new methods proposed for deal-
ing with the old and familiar
frontiers which have been in ex-
istence.

He compared the change-over
from the oldest president to
serve the United States, to the
youngest president elected to the
office, to that of a corporation:

A young man replaces an old
man and brings in new ideas; he
is more alert and perhaps more
efficient, but the basis of the or-
ganization remains -the same.

Indians Invad

Cagers After

1 Eighth Win In

VillanovaGame

Miami of Ohio Posts
Next Obstacle for
Hoopsters Saturday

Coach Bobby Timmons’
cagers will put their modest
one game win streak on the
line tonight when the Indians
from Villanova go on the
Warpath at 8 p.m. in the Field
House. The Panther Frosh, own-
ing a six game streak of their
own, will take on Youngstown in
the preliminary starting at 6 p.m.

Coach A1 Severance enters the
Field House with an astute round-
ball aggregation which should be
in the top ten national rankings,
but because of one downfall,
therein lies the hope for the Blue
and Gold. '

The Philadelphia five’s weak-
ness is their routine tendency to
relax against an underdog, an
epithet which is a routine ad-
dress for Bob Timmons’ crew.

Rousing Win

The Cats battled West Virginia
down to the wire in their an-
nual version of the fabled Mc-,
Coy vs. Hatﬁeld feud before suc-
cumbing, 73-68 last week. Then
they emerged from the Penn Pa-
lestra with a rousing overtime
win, 80-75 over Temple Satur-
day. ’

The possibility gains momen-
tum when one considers these
additional factors: the Wildcats
were ambushed by Army, 64-59,
and the Cadets only edged Tim-
mons’ ﬁve, 84-80. Penn eked out
a 63-62 win over Villanova. last
week, and thus far the Panthers *
have enjoyed great success
against Ivy League representa-
tives.

Severance’s b oys, however,
knocked off George King’s Moun-
taineers, 82-77, as Jim Huggard
tossed in 28 points for Villanova.

Strong Conteder

Severance also has Hubie White,
a strong contender for All-Amer-
ican recognition, and Tom Galia,
a sixifoot sophomore, who can
dunk a ball like a player 6-9. An-
other secret weapon is Severance’s
own mannerisms. .

Mermen Host Bucknell; First

Battle Between

Swim Teams

Panther swimmers take on a new opponent when they
meet the mermen of Bucknell for the first time Saturday,
2:30 p.m., at the Carnegie Tech pool. '

“We have no idea of what to expect from Buckne11,”
says Blue and Gold Coach Ben Grady. “The only possible
way to judge would‘ be by comparative times.” .

The Bucknell times are very 6

good. Chuck Maunz swims the
200-yard breaststroke in 2:37,
better than any Panther time
for the same distance.

The visitors’ Bill Dearstyne is
intercollegiate backstroke cham-
pion, and his times for the hun-
dred and two hundred will give
the locals a lot to think about.

The Panthers, edged by Mary-
land last week, still have hopes
for ' an outstanding year. ‘Their
record now stands 1-2.

“It’s good for the boys to com-
pete against stiff competition
like Maryland,” says Coach
Grady. “We’re not at all dis-
couragcd. Our times have been
improving all year, and I ex-
pect these improvements to pay
off with victories.

Grady called Bart Haas, only
individual winner against Mary-
land, “one of the most improved
swimmers on the team.” Haas is

a freestyler. Tony Sarsﬁeld is ten ‘

seconds under his best time of last
year in the 200-yard butterﬂy.
Everything points to an im-
proved Panther team giving _a
strong battle to their new foes.

Frosh Trackmen
Vie at West Point

Army frosh possess what .the
Cadets consider to be their ﬁnest
track teams in recent years. The
Panther frosh will meet the Cadets
Saturday at West Point.

“I don’t think any freshmen
team could beat a yearling team
from the Point or Annapolis,”
Coach Carl Rees said. “They are
loaded with talent .. and usually
ﬁeld a team of 60 men. We don’t
have the depth necessary to com-
pete with them.

Rees, however, expects Gary
Meckley, pole vault; Al Thomas,
35-pound weight; Steve Waslo,
two-mile; Joe Friend, hurdles and
Bill Mocnik, 1000-yard dash to
gain points for the Panther Cubs.

Panthers Seek 1st Win Saturday
At Home, Army Rated Strong

By LARRY HAGGERTY
Since last November, Panther athletic teams have felt
the wrath of Army in football,
while no letup appears to be in sight on Saturday afternoon
when the Cadets encounter the Panther gymnasts at 2 o’clock

basketball and squash. Mean-

EIGL team champions and

Point last year 62-34. Leading the
Cadets into town will be Jon
Aaronson who has -captured the
Eastern flying rings championship
for the past two seasons.

The meet with Army, the sec-
ond of the campaign for the Blue
and Gold, will mark the last con-
test at home for Coach Warren
Neiger’s P_anthers in 1961. The
Jungle Cat gymnasts lost to Navy
in their opening meet, also at the
Field House, 66-30.

Much Better Showing
Neiger, however, is conﬁdent
that his squad will make a much
better showing against the Cadets.
“Army just did get by Syracuse
by two points and if our boys can
hit we might make the score a
lot closer than some people
think,” declared the Panther coach
after Monday’s practice session.
Sharing the spotlight with
Aaronson on Saturday will be
the Jungle Cats’ crack tumbler,
Earl McConnell, who downed
Navy’s EIGL tumbling champ,
Joe Marshall, to open the cam-
paign, successfully. s
Joining McConnell to comprise
the Panthers’ trio of tumblersare
co-captain Joe Battaglia and,Bob
Pingatore. Coach Tom Maloney
of Army will counter with Bob
Dickinson, Sandy Walters and Bill
Chandler. McConnell ﬁgures to
win easily.
Weakest Event
The Blue and Gold’s weakest
event is the difficult side horse,’
therefore the Cadets’ Ralph Gar-
ens, Steve Foote and Ken Wal-
lace may sweep. this event from
the Panthers’ McConnell, ‘Ron
Daugherty and Ed Zamecnik.
Co-captain Jack Rainaldi

Athletic‘ Dept.
Cures 2Pains
With One Pill

Executive Sports Editor
By JACK SMITH

 

An asphalt ﬂoor and an indoor board track for runners
was put in’ the Field House this Fall which has enabled the
Athletic Department to cure two headaches with one pill.

For many years the Field House had been known as the
“Dust Bowl.” The ﬂoor was made of dirt and both workers
and sports fans left the building with enough dirt on their
clothes to grow ﬂowers. ‘

Maintenance costs were high and often laborers were
kept busy sweeping ofﬁces and the basketball court. Many
sports fans refused to come to the Field House because of
the unpleasant conditions.

Trackmen had to run on a dirt track that was often
uneven. Track'Coach Carl Rees said that this caused
unnecessary ankle and foot injuries.

All these problems apparently were solved with the new
ﬂoor and board track that cost Pitt almost $13,000. And,
from all indications the beneﬁts were worth the costs.

Maintenance costs due to dirt have diminished, Workers
are now able to complete jobs that were often put aside
because of cleaning problems.

Coach Rees claims that the board track has been a
valuable asset to his trackmen. Injuries that plagued
the Panthers in the past have decreased. Runners are
making faster times than ever before.

Sophomore Harry Stokes, the Panther’s top runner, was
running the indoor 440-yard dash in 49 seconds on the dirt
track; now he is doing the quarter-mile in 47.5 seconds. In»
the half-mile distance the board track cut four seconds from
his time.

Although this may not seem to be very much time -to
the non-track fan, it’s time that could only.be reduced by
months of training and hard work on the dirt ﬂoor. ’

It also helps give the Panther track team practice
conditions that are similar to meet conditions. The only
drawback of the board track is that it is not banked on
the turns, therefore home meets cannot be scheduled.
The good points, however, far outweight these few
shortcomings.

Already Frank Carver, Panther Athletic Director, has
received many favorable comments from sports fans who
traveled to the Field House and were pleased by the im-
proved conditions. .

No, we don’t expect that a cleaner Field House will
help set attendance records, but it has wiped out a black
eye in University sports. Hats off to the Athletic Department
which has helped rid sports reporters of cleaning bills.

Track Team "Seeks First Win
In Indoor Meet At West Point

Depth May Prove Difference in Outcome;
Rees.Rates Cats Stronger in Field Events

A win is needed in both the
mile and two—mile relays this
week if the indoor Panther
trackmen hope to come home
with a win in a dual meet
with Army Saturday, accord-

ing to Coach Carl Rees. ,

Depth proved to be the ‘differ-
ence in the Panthers, 71-38, loss to
Navy two weeks ago. It may once
again prove a factor Saturday at
Army, for Army,» like Navy, usu-
ally has three fresh men for every
race. The Panthers, on the other
hand, are forced to use runners in
several races.

Steve Munter, Bob Shanafelt
and Bill Markowitz have been
"selected by Coach Carl Rees to
run the 60-yard dash.

Vance Carter and Harry Stokes
are listed to run the 600—yard run
and mile run respectively. Stokes
ran the 600—yard run at Navy and
posted ‘a time of 1:12.5. Carter ran
the 1000 yard race in 2:l3.8 at
Navy, both men won their race.

“Stokes and Carter are not our
key men,” Rees said, “I know I.
can put these two runners in
any race and know they could
win. But we must get top per-
formances from runners like
Captain Bill Hinchber er, Reed _
Clarke and Don Ada in order

Against Navy, four of the Pan-
thers’ men in ﬁeld events turned
in the best performances of their
college careers. Dan Kanell threw
the shot 51 feet, one inch. Dick
Clark threw the 35-pound weight
57 feet, seven inches. Ed Sher-

vaulted 13 feet. Each of these men

Line-up

Matmen Battle Tough Army

Martin Zolikoffi
Still Unbeaten;
Cadets Ready

I By TED COLTON
‘With three ..wins already
tucked under their belts the
Panther matmen will try for
number four this weekend

when they invade the un-
friendly conﬁnes » of that
Castle on the Hudson, Army, which
always provides stiff competition
for the Panthers, and who will try
to hand the Cats their second loss.

The Army-Panther rivalry has
seen the two schools meeting nine
times and the Blue and Gold cap-
turing eight wins.

Last year the Panthers defeated
the Cadets in a close 19-11 contest
by jumping off to an early lead
and wrapping up the meet in, the
opening matches. This year Coach
Rex Peery’s grapplers have been
having their troubles in the lower
weight classes.

Won First Four

Last year during the regular
dual meet campaign the Panthers
won the first four matches of
every meet except one. That one
was the Syracuse match in which
John Zolikoﬁ battled Les Austin
to a tie.

This year Coach Peery has

been forced to move his wrest- 9

lers around to different weight
classes thus resulting in losses,
in the early matches.

Daryl Kelvington, Cat regular
137 pounder, lost his ﬁrst dual
meet match _against Michigan
when he was entered in the" 157
pound division- Larry Lauchle,
wrestling in his regular class, also
lost his first match against Michi-
gan.

.. Osmun at 137

Dick Martin and Zolikoff are
the only~Panthers to remain un-
beaten. Dave Osmun has been in-
serted in the 137 pound class when
Kelvington is moved up. ‘ Against
Army, Peery will probably go with
this arrangement.

In the heavier classes Peery

will have Jim Harrison, a sopho-
more, wrestle in either the 167
or 177 pcund division. Harrison
has a 4-1 record and has looked
good in his first ﬁve varsity
matches. His only loss came
when he was wrestling 20
pounds over his usual weight
class.
. Augie Arrigone, may be wrest-
ling in the 177 or 191 pound class
against Army. Arrigone has posted
one win this year but he too has
to take on heavier opponents.

In the heavyweight class Bob
Guzik still has the inside track.

Although he lost a close one to,

Northwestern, Peery still feels
Guzik can become one of the top
heavyweights in the country.

F rosh Hoopers Hope to Extend
Winil Skein in 2 Tilts This Week

In quest _of their seventh

and eighth consecutive wins,

the Panther freshmen host Youngstown tonight at the Field
House, then travel to Indiana State College for a game

Saturday.

Coach Carl Peterson’s frosh defeated both of these teams

soundly..earlier in the season.

The defeats are part of the

six-game win skien the little Cats?

possess.
The’ freshmen have gained
momentum over the past few
weeks, picking up wins over
Kent State and previously -un-
defeated West Virginia. But the
Frosh are yet to hit the rough-
est part of their schedule.
Duquesne must be played twice
and there is Slippery Rock, the
only team to defeat the Panther
Cubs. The Panthers must face
both Slippery Rock and West Vir-

courts.

In previous years the Panthers
have defeated West Virginia at
the Field House by 30 points, only
to lose to them at Morgantown.

But unlike other years, Coach
Peterson possesses a balanced
team with any one of‘ eight
players able to break into
double ﬁgures. Brian Generalo-
vich, Cal Sheﬂield and Dave

Sauer have paced the Cubs in

scoring to date. Generalovich
and Sheffield have been averag-
ing close to 20 points a game
while Sauer has been hitting
about 18.

Other top players have been
Paul Martha, Paul Kreger, John
Jenkins, Al Riccuti and Dave Bly-
shak. _ '
