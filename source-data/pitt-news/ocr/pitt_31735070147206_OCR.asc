Professor analyzes conﬂict in Egypt

Olivia Garber
Assistant News Editor

Fifteen minutes after the start of an
on—campus lecture about the ﬁiture
ofEgypt, Hosni Mubarak made inter-
national headlines when he pledged
to step down from his 30-year reign
as Egyptian president amidst pres-

, . sure from hundreds‘ of thousands of

protesters.
But the 75 people gathered on the
fourth ﬂoor of Posvar Hall missed the

His predictions proved to be un-
cannily accurate. Although professor
Herzawi was hesitant to make any deﬁ-
nite claims about the country’s ﬁiture,
he said that ifMubarak stepped down,

Instead, Herzawi predicted that
Mubarak would stay in power until
September, when Egypt is scheduled

to hold its next election. Herzawi made

Tomei
earns
100th win
in victory

Mike Furlong
Stajf Writer

Earning 100 victories is not an
easy task for any person in colle-
giate wrestling. Yet Pitt currently
has two such accomplished wres-
tlers on its roster. .

When senior Ryan Tomei had
his hand raised for the 100th
time as a Panther after a win over
Bloomsburg Sunday, it marked
the second time this January that
a Pitt wrestler has achieved that
milestone — redshirt junior Ty-
ler Nauman reached his 100th
win a few weeks back.

“It’s not an easy thing to do,”
Pitt head coach Rande Stottle-
myer said. “Especially for the
“situation that [Tomei] was in —
he doesn’t start wrestling until
his senior year [in high school].
He’s a remarkable story in a lot

. of ways. I just wish he had more

time. He’s doing the best he can,
and he’s doing a pretty good job
of it.” '

Thanks in part to Tornei’s per-
sonal career milestone, the Pan-
thers (9-6, 2-0 EWL) dismantled
the Bloomsburg Huskies (11-5,
0-3 EWL) by a score of 22-8 at
home in the Fitzgerald Field

’ House.

The Panthers jumped out
early with sophomore Anthony
Zanetta pulling in a 6-4 overtime
victory over Bloomsburg fresh-
man Sean Boylan.

Zanetta was able to fight back
hard against Boylan, using two

Unlike Pitt, some Pa. schools haveamnesty policies

Philip Bombara
' Staﬁ’ Writer

While some universities in the state
have had amnesty policies for under-
age drinkers for years, Pitt officials
have maintained that such a policy
would not work here.

Amnesty policies at universities
generally state that students will
not be cited for underage drinking
when seeking medical attention.
Both Carnegie Mellon and Temple
universities have ‘similar amnesty
policies for underage students. Pitt
ofﬁcials have said on multiple occa-

sions that the University does not a

have plans to implement an anmesty
policy of its own.

Currently, Pitt’s policy does not
address students seeking medical
attention. Underage Pitt students
found drinking by University police
are subject to criminal citations and
University judicial sanctions. In ad-
dition, any students found “know-

ingly present” of an alcohol viola-
tion on campus are also subject to
University sanctions, according to
the Student Code of Conduct.

The Alcohol Medical Assistance A

Procedure, an administrative policy
at CMU, officially grants amnesty to
students seeking medical attention
as a result of alcohol consumption.
Students at CMU are told of the
policy both during student orien-
tation and in their ﬁrst meetings

"with their RAs in residence halls,

said Holly Hippensteel, the assistant
dean of Student Affairs at Carnegi
Mellon. ‘ ‘

Hippensteel said that the univer-
sity wanted the policy to remove the
fear of punishment associated with
seeking help.

“If it saves a life, then it is some-
thing I feel good about. It doesn’t
address the problem directly, but
it does help address an existing is-
sue. It is one tool, not a cure-all,”
she said. ‘

She also said that it is important

to note that even though the pro-
tocol grants amnesty to students
seeking medical attention, any case
of an intoxicated student who is bel-
ligerent or vandalizing university
property is not within thebounds of

the protocol, and the studentwill be
reprimanded as the officers on the
scene and the university see ﬁt.

In addition, any student that
uses the amnesty policy is required
to take part in the alcohol educa-
tion programs that the university
offers.

“This really needed to be a joint
effort with all parts of the university

working together. From the admin-

assistance for the effects of drugs or

alcohol will not be charged with any v

violations of the Student Conduct
Code by university police. The am_-
nesty applies to both the student in
need of assistance andthe person
or persons seeking medical assis-
tance on the intoxicated student’s
behalf. - ' — g I
Andrea Seiss, senior assistant

dean of students at Temple Univer- I

sity, said that the school’s policy has
been in effect for about ﬁve years.
In the past few years, she said, she N
hasseen an increase in the number ’
of students taking advantage of the
policy, though she could not point
to statistics.

According to Temple Universi-
ty’s- 2010 Annual Security and Fire ‘

_ Safety Report, there have been only

18-arrests at on~campus residence
halls for alcohol law violations in
the .past three years. But, in 2009
alone, there were 233 disciplinary
actions/referrals made with regards
to liquor law violations.
Comparatively, Pitt reported
119 liquor law violations in 2009,

' with 108 citation arrests and 11

disciplinary referrals, according
to the University’s published crime
statistics.

Temple informs all students of
the university’s amnesty policy dur-
ing freshmen orientation. Resident
assistants also discuss the policy

Studentl,GOVe,rnment Board appoints Committee chairs

Marissa Meredyth
Senior Staff Writer

The newly appointed Student Gov-
ernment Board committee chairs
easily stood out amid the slew of
disappointed faces last night in
Nordy’s Place.

In a meeting that lasted about
an hour and a half, SGB denied
almost $15,000 in requests from
various student organizations; But
the news wasn’t bad for all those in
attendance, as the Board took time
to appoint seven students to lead

committees  the Board.

SGB has the power to allocate '

the Student Activities Fund —
about $2.3 million —— to certiﬁed
student organizations. About $1.1
million of the ﬁind is left for the 350
non-formula certiﬁed student orga-

nizations after “formula groups” ‘

like WPTS, Pitt Program Council
and Panther Prints get their shares.
The fund is replenished by the $80
fee non-College of General Studies
students pay each semester.

One hotly contended request

last night involved the Women’s'

Fastpitch Softball Club’s request to

go to Florida for a spring training
tournament.

Club president Lauren Rupert
and student coach and fundrais-

ing executive Hyla Wallis asked I
the Board to uphold the Allocation t

Committee’s recommendation to
approve the $5,569.02 they re-
quested.

But the Board voiced concern
with a $5,000 “guideline” for club
sports. In 2009, the $5,000-per-
year cap for club sports was re-
pealed and has since remained as
a guideline — normally broken in
cases when a team made it to na-

tionals. _ .
SGB president Molly Stieber has

previously mentioned-the new 2011 7 

Board’s interest in reinstating this
cap. Stieber said after Allocations
101 a few weeks ago that this is un-

likely to occur.

Still, Board member Zach We-
ber mentioned the guideline and
asked Allocations Chair Mike Bane
how much the club has received this
ﬁscal year. Bane estimated $7,800

— or $3,000 for tournaments and ‘'

$4,800 for practices.

“This would put you very far '

over that $5,000 guideline,” Weber

.—(A-51...,

‘said. “lt’s tough to give that much
over.” ’ ' ' - ,
Weber motioned to amendithe

_ _ request and completely deny trans-
portation and gas. ' ‘

Board member Emily Hoover
said this request was extremely
similar to Club Baseball’s request

' to attend spring training. She said

transportation for the club should
be provided during the Florida
trip.’ ' I - ‘

When Stieber called for avote on
the amended request, Weber was
the only member tovote in favor

1 of denying transportation and gas.

moved ﬁom oﬂice. Because Mubarak
has been in control for 30 years, the
questioner suggested the possibility
of another authoritarian party taking
control. V

Herzawi said most people’ aren’t
thinking that far into the ﬁiture just
yet. Instead, they arefocused on Muba-
rak.

IfMubarakwere to concede power,
Herzawi said, new leaders would have

to incorporate some structures of the .

old regime.

A transition period is necessary if
Egyptwants to avoid a “political vacu-
um,” he said. “The U.S. does not want
to ﬁnd itself with another Iran.”

President Barack Obarna echoed
those sentiments in a brief White
Housefaddress yesterday evening.

“An orderly transition must be
meaningful, it must be peaceful and
it must begin now,” he said. '

On campus, Herzawi delivered a
brief history of the nation beginning
with Mubarak’s assent into an au-
thoritarian role in the 1980s. He also
described the people’s rise to activism
on the street.

As an Egyptian who works with
Cairo University and the Center for

   

Strategic and International Studies
in Washington, D.C., Herzawi offered
suidentsanintimate perspective on the
current conflicts‘ rising in the streets
of '
Onjan. 25, more than 100,000
protesters marched in downtown

Cairo, shouting for democracy and

an end to Mubarak’s 30-year regime.
Since then, the Egyptian police and
army have clashed with the protest-
ers, culminating in more than 100
deaths. _
Communicationfrom the country
hasbeenlirnited duringtheuirmoil, es-
pecially since Egyptian authorities shut

. off the Internet last Friday, spurring

some students to attend the lecture in
anattemptto glean more information
about the situation.

A trio of juniors who were lucky
enough to nab seats said they came to
get more information about the pro-
tests in Egypt. More than 20 people
were left standing or sittinginbetween

the rows of chairs while others milled .

outside the doorway, unable to see
Herzawi or his slides. .-

A large part of the movement in-

She went on to say that the University’s stu-

in close unison with one another. When there
is an incident involving intoxicated underage
students, campus safety does not issue aformal

“A question along the lines of, “How did you

The university then looks into the situation

of seeking medical attention when Campus
Safety became involved. If this is the case, then
the situation is within the bounds of the am-
nesty policy and the Office of Student Conduct

Uncle Sam takes

merican Apparel had

Apeople peeved last sum-

mer when it sold a T-

shirt ﬂaunting the message “eat
less.”

Now, the U.S. Department of

Agriculture and U.S. Department

of Health and Human Services a

are mimicking those trendy tops
by telling people to cut down on

. their portions, and surprisingly,

it’s the best dietary advice they’ve
ever forwarded. ,

According to The New York
Times, the major difference be-
tween the new dietary guidelines
and those from past years is that
“this time the government sug-
gests that Americans  just eat
less.”

Although a concept so sim-
ple probably won’t serve as an
“aha!” moment for next season’s
potential “Biggest Loser” can-
didates, the message is a step in
the fewer—heart—attacks-during-
the-Super-Bowl direction for the
government. ’

Why? Because as The New

York.Times pointed out, the new

guidelines demonstrate the gov-
ernment’s willingness to sever
ties with powerful food lobby-
ists. _ ‘ '

The process of creating the
dietary guidelines is viewed as
highly political, and rightfully so
in our opinion. Instead of saying
-“eat less red meat,” the govern—
ment can say “eat less saturated
fat.” It’s a‘win—win situation for
meat lobbyists and government

. officials, but not necessarily for

for legitimate advice about what
to _eat in what proportions.
Though some citizens might
not study the guidelines the same
way they study their ex—boyfriend
or ex-girlfriend’s Facebook up-l
dates, food manufacturers and
distributors take notice.

substituted whole grains for re-
ﬁned grains in its guidelines for
breakfast cereals.
b In addition, Walmart -—— the
world’s largest retailer —— re-
cently revealed a five-year plan»
for selling more nutritional food,
according to CNN.

We hope that the “eat less” » ‘

guidelines will also encour-
age restaurants to reduce john
Goodman—sized portions — a
contributor to the obesity epi-
demic in the country, according
to the National Heart,.Lung and
Blood Institute.

*Of course, if you still fear po-

guidelines, you can always con-
sult a nutritionist or registered

The new guidelines are avail-
able in a 112—page PDF at www.

As the Super Bowl approaches,

many of your peers are switching
their Facebook default proﬁle photos
to the logo of our beloved hometown
Steelers. Now you’re faced with a
terrible choice: Should you jump on
the bandwagon or remain a rugged

tion you choose, the fact remains
that selecting your Facebook proﬁle
photo — far from being a privilege
— is a tremendous burden.
Although the recent Facebook

and importance of the proﬁle photo,
picking the right one still demands
careful consideration. This is the
“face” that you’re going to show the

to divine your darkest secrets. Tothis

end, we’ve decided to come to your
assistance with a handful of tips and

pose for duringsurmnertimevisits to

tryingto be ironic, in which case ev-
eryone will totally get it, and you’re
totally within your rights to do it.
Perhaps you’re a bit too modest
and retiring to put your own face
out there. In that case, select your
favorite academic celebrity to rep-
resent you. Gilles Deleuze, Jacques
Derrida and Kurt Vonnegut all have
great hair. Leo Tolstoy might be a bit
too old school and anarcho—Christian
for most, but that wild heard of his

can’t be denied. Michel Foucault is

' a smart choice, because people who

aren’t as smart as you might wind up
mistaking him for Picasso, Stravin-
sky, Lex Luthor or some other dead
bald guy.

However, we recognize that this
nerdy stuff won’t work for many of
you. You people are painﬁilly at-
tractive and need to share your rare

beauty with the world. If this rare .

beauty happens to be marred by an
inelegant chin or a Kirsten Dunst-like
snaggletooth, you can disguise that
with a few well—angled shots from
the iPhone’s Hipstamatic app. We
mustcaution, however, that a vanity-
based approach to Facebook photos
will require constant vigilance. To
truly succeed, you must scrutinize all
of the images of you, de—tagging or
deleting the ones that fail to present
you at the pinnacle of your ravishing
good looks. And guys, here’s a special
hint for you: Nothing says drop—dead

Worlqvs best country could use some kicks  

Andrew Kaback

Columnist I

London is kind of dreary. I know that
I’m not exactly reinventing the wheel
with that realization, but it’s terribly
disappointing. I’m still conﬁised as to

” why I haven’t had Peter Pan fairy dust

sprinkled on me. And wherethe hellis
Mary Poppins? I can’t even go out to a
restaurant — no, the food doesn’t ac-
tually taste thatbad; it’sjustaSweeney
Todd thing. The sixth time thatl sent
soon—to—be Princess Kate Middleton
my phone number and received no re-
sponsewas the moment thatl started
to reconsider this trip. '

All right, living in London isn’t all

that bad. It’s better than a romantic '

evening with David Ca_rradine.lStill
ids absolute rubbish to haveto pay for
all of this crap in pounds sterling. The
dollar needs to step its game up be-

cause my wallet is weighing less than '

Keira Knightley right now. Again, I’m
not just tryingto complain about how
bloody awﬁil London is, I’m simply
saying that David Beckham wouldn’t
be the most metrosexual man in this
city.

I can’t pretend for too long that I

don’t love livingin London. It’s arnaz-
ing to be in Europe, and London has
some of the greatest sights and experi-

ences that the world can offer. Yes, I ‘

mean Tower Bridge and Westminster
Abbey and allthatjazz, butlreallyam
talking about soccer. Wait — what
did I just say?

Ilove the United States. People who
love the US. don’t love soccer. Saying
Ilove soccerwould be like sayingthat
my favorite kind ofbreakfast food is a
crepe. Amllettiiig my country down?
Do I like football? Did I just refer to
soccer as football?.I’m supposed to
be all about baseball and real football.
I’rn supposed to be all about Peyton
Mamiingand AlbertPujols—I’m sup-
posed to think soccer is lame.

No matter how hard I try to keep
my American reputation going, I don’t
thinkl canmakeitthroughthe semes-
ter. I’ve tried to be as loudas I can, and
I’ve made a fool out of myself at ev-
ery pub. Even more so, I’ve said more
words on the London Underground
thanevery English person combined.
I am doing my damdest to make my
country proud, but soccer is just de-
stroying my patriotism. '

Now I usually consider myself

quite the American sports fan. I am
all about cold weather, hot dogs and

* drunken public displays of affection.

Some NASCAR fans might need to
put their shirts back on, but still,
Americans are some of the best fans
in the world. Sure, Canadians can get
excited about their hockey, but I’d take

‘ difference between an English person

and a hooligan is game day, and it is
brilliant

Why doesn’t the U.S. have a legiti-
mate interest in soccer? The longer
I’m here, the more convinced I am that
soccer would be perfect for our great
nation. Here’s the thing about soc-

beard any day of the week. Between
“Field of Dreams” and “Angels in the
Outﬁe1d,”Ihave shed more tearsthan
viewers ofjames Cameron movies.
A soccer stadium in England is
like a great church, only with less-
comfortable seats and a higher at-
tendance rate. The Brits care about
soccer more than Ryan Seacrest does
about his hair. It’s like everybody in

— the entire country put down their tea

and picked up a soccer ball. The only

cer: It’s awesome! Well, it’s still kind of
ﬁlledwith crying and short-shorts, but
then again I lovejersey Shore too. Soc‘-.
cer is excellent because it combines all

of this country’s favorite sports into

one beautiﬁil game:

It has all of the drama of basket- _
ball, the crowds of football and the
bore of baseball.

I understand that just because
British people like sometliingdoesn’t
make it awesome _—l you know I’rn
talkingabout cucumber sandwiches.

ButI promise that soccer is different. I
don’t mean differentlike Michael]ack—
son’s choices late in life, but more like
Lady Gaga different. We love cheers
and spectacular showings of athleti-
cism, and soccerwould give that to us.
London might be dreary, but don’t we
Pittsburghers know that dreary days
are the best for sports?

London hasn’t been everything
that I wished it would be. There’s a
serious lack of Shakespearean c1otl1—
ing and usage of the word “cheerio.”
Iﬁgured thatlwould be in the CSI lab
with Sherlock Hohnes and pickpock-
etingwith Oliver Twist, but the closest
that Londonhas come to fulﬁllingmy
expectations has been in the abun-
dance of jokes about the French.

London has given me one thing
that I never imagined —— an apprecia-
tionforthe game that the entire world
loves. I realize that the United States is
the best country in the world, but it’s
timeforusto make the realizationthat
the rest of the universe already has:

lame, but at least it’s not cricket. I

In the event that none of these

suggestions do it for you, opt for a '

Keep in mind, though, that what
we’ve produced here is far from an

to get really crazy, you could use a
picture of a 1980s cartoon character
or a photo of you that’s been Simp-

very little can compete with that

-Larissa Gula
Staff Writer

For most girls, the end of a relation-
ship means calling up the girlfriends
to watch a movie or two —— ice cream
Optional but recommended. But not
for  Instead, she develops fan-
tastic powers and is recruited for a‘
battle in space. . '
Kell is the creation of Pitt student
Azia Squire, and the main character
in her upcoming fantasy novel, “Liq—
uid: The Uni ” The idea for Kell, her
powers and her battle has been seven
years in the making. But the upcom-
ing publication of “Liquid: The Unit”
isn’t the ﬁrst for Squire. '

' Another piece, titled “Affect-Ef- _

feet”, was published in 2008. Squire
noted that herwriting style has
evolved and improved vastly since
then. ' ‘

“I plan to keep publishing, and
this was just the first,” Squire said
in reference to “Liquid: The Unit,”
which she considers her ﬁrst true
novel because she’s taken more
critical direction with the writing in
this work than she did with ‘Affect-
Effect.”

, Squire is a junior studying English

writing, philosophy and anthropol-

ogy. The 2.0-year-o1d_Atlanta native
chose to study at Pitt because of the
prestige of its philosophy department

and the full scholarship she earned as _

a Gates Millennium Scholar.
Though Squire had developed and
revised the story of Kell by.the time
she arrived at college, she only had
“vague ideas, images and scenes” in
her mind for the story when she be-
gan writing seven years ago. It took
time to ﬂesh out the story and speciﬁc
details, including what KeH’s power
would be: the ability to turn her body
into _a mercurial substance that burns
through almost any material.

“I wrote the original idea when I
was 13,” said Squire, who submitted
the short story version of her latest
work to a writing contest at Stock-
bridge Middle School. “I  came

‘back to it later after I won the con-
test. I looked at it and began writing
a couple more drafts.” ‘

Her reinvented version expanded
on the idea Squire originally created
with a new story and new charac-
ters. The story is based heavily in her
imagination rather than in research.
But despite Kell beingastrange char-
acter in a fantasy story, Squire de-
scribed her as a universal person.

“When you read the story, she’s

3

whoever youwant her to be, ’ Squire

said. “She’s your eyes into the story, A

and I would hope that she would be a
role model for anyone. It’s notfor any ‘

speciﬁc demographic. It deals with ’

themes and issues that any person
can relate to.”

Such themes include the idea of
creating and understanding identity
as well as growing up and maturing
— which Kell is forced to do pretty
quickly. _

I “It’s about how the people and the
experiences that you have lay a hand

in shaping you as a person,” Squire .

said. “It’s also about being swept up
in things that you can’t control. And

a yes, I’ve had experiences like this, but

I think we all have. Identity and loss
of control are things that everyone
can relate to.” A . o a

Songs that are completely silent
can ring far louder than even your
favorite hardcore band’s signature
tunes. _ .
There have always been divergent
strains in music; people shading the
musical landscape with off—colored
crayons far outside the lines. With
every successive generation the kids
put out something weirder, and it

sibility. ' ‘ o

Amid all the musical tinkerers
of the 20th century, John Cage was
the most notorious for breaking the
rules. Overaso-year career, his com-
positions incorporated sounds from
found materials — like car horns
and paperclips placed between piano
strings — and played with listeners’
expectations of time and space.

_ Cage believed everything we
hear — on the chart or not -—— is

MOVIE REVIEW

‘The Illusionist’ mesmerizes with little dialogue

Ben Labe
A Staff Writer

“The Illusionist”

Starring Jean-Claude Donda, Eilidh
Rankin and Duncan MacNeil

Directed by Sylvain Chomet

Grade: A

French director Sylvain Chomet’s exqui~
sitely animated ﬁlm “The Illusionist”
moves forward brilliantly — and almost
completely without dialogue.

When the movie’s characters do Com— .

municate audibly, they do so through
grunts, sighs and other crude noises. Most
of the communication during the 80-min-
ute ﬁlm is visual, operating through the
characters’ demeanors, expressions and
gesticulations.

Nonetheless, the director of “The Trip-
lets of Belleville” manages to convey the
characters’ thoughts and emotions poi-
gnantly and precisely, giving us enough
information to understand the events that
transpire. '

Originally written but unproduced in
1956 by the French ﬁlm legend Jacques

Tati, who died in 1982, “The Illusionist”
tells the story of a washed-up magician
who travels from one dilapidated theater
to the next performing his craft.

When a whimsical Scottish drunk hires
him to perform in a town that is only now
celebrating its first electric light bulb,
the magician encounters a young, naive
housemaid. It is likely that the housemaid
genuinely believes in his magic. When he
produces a,brand—new pair of shoes in
front of her — seemingly by magic -
she decides that he ought to be her new
caretaker. Either too kind or too proud
to confess to the girl that his magic is not
real, the magician continues to conjure
expensive clothes for the girl until he can
afford it no more.

Chomet is a master animator, and he
uses every advantage that his medium of-
fers. His images are highly detailed -— each
communicates to the audience through
color, light, perspective and the physical
shapes of the characters.

Every character is an embodiment of
his or her personality. The magician is
drawn to resemble Tati, yet his every line
emanates sadness and nostalgia. Some of

ALBUM REVIEW

Tiger Bones rattles ears

‘Sara Pecora
Staff Writer

Tiger Bones
Go OverHere
Dedd Foxx

Rocks  The Cure, Joy Division, _

Thesmiths
Grade: B ‘

The post-punk sound ofthe’80s is alive
and well again in the debut EP of Chi-
cago band Tiger Bones. ,

Unlike many current post-punk

bands, '1‘igerBones manages to capture »

the essence of the original movement,
sounding very similar to bands such
asjoy Division and The Cure while still
maintaininga modern feel.   »

T The album’s lyrical materialisdark,
evokinganimage of a ratherdepressing
life overthe deep, low melancholic rock
of yesteiyear, while adding a modern

ﬂavor of dreamy pop. The combina-

tion creates a lovely, simple sound. The
guitarandbassriffsin“Ki1lThem,”for
example, has a sinister sound attimes,
ﬁtting of the song’s title. Songs like the
rathersho1t“Nothing,”meanwhile,are

 

bouncy andfast-pacedwhilestillretain— -

ingthe moody feel of tlie genre.
One big tripping point is vocalist
Jonathan Burden: He sounds like a
low-rate Ian Curtis ofjoy Division. His
intonation is awkward, andhis singing

inﬂection is bothersome, distracting .

from the music with its droning, dis-

» comﬁted quality.

All in all, if you’re a fan of the ’8os
post-punk scene and want to hear a
modern take on it, this album might
ﬁt in with your collection.Their album

ten to theirﬁrst single “Kill Them” out

Cage impacts Cale’s work  

Wagner 4 9

mid—196os, brought together a num-
ber of other sympathetic artists to
create the Theatre of Eternal Music
(otherwise known as The Dream
Syndicate).

True to its name, the group played

drones (sustained single notes) for .

hours on end, philosophizing on
how the improvisational composi-
tions could last for hundreds of years

at a time. Followers of the Theatre’

borrowed heavily from Indian and

Middle Eastern musical traditions.

while employing hand drums,
throat—sung vocals and Young’s
occasional sax. They also had ex-
perimental methods of amplifying
stringed instruments.

; Because the lineup changed fre-

‘A quently while the group was together

in the mid—1960s, several alumni
were able to carry the avant—garde
ideas to the wider world. One of
Young’s gifted students, John Cale,

would go on to form a group con-

sidered the patriarch of alternative
music, the Velvet Underground.
Born in the coal—mining village

V of Garnant, Wales, Cale proved to
be a child prodigy on the viola. Af-

ter studying music in England, as a
young man he traveled to America
where he met his childhood hero,
John Cage, and continued to pursue
an academic path in composition.

Eventually his concentration
turned to Young’s dro_nes,. which
Cale modiﬁed and played with in
his own recordings. Even as his time
with Young’s group waned, he was
collaborating with Lou Reed to play
rock ’n’ roll in a way that used the
same experimental attitude. Reed’s
contemporary sense of language
combined with Cale’s contemporary
sense of sound, and together they
wrote and arranged songs that are
the ﬁrst traces of punk.

The Velvet Undergro.und’s “Ve—
nus in Furs” relies on Cale’s moan

' of a drone throughthe viola while

“All Tomorrow’s Parties” makes use

 of a prepared piano, ﬂuctuating be-

tween two notes that resonate with
‘all the connected strings surround-
ing them. A

« The way the two met even cen-
tered on experimentation -— Reed’s
“Ostrich” guitartuning, making ev-
ery string a “D” while played open

—— which is when you play without
touching the fret board. Cale _Was
impressed by this nod to a resonant
form of drone. '

Cage is pervasive in his DNA, even

on songs that sound like they could a

have been written by a delinquent
’50s teen. The collaboration between
Cale and Reed continued through
one more album before Cale left
to spread the seeds of avant—garde
music throughout a solo career and
various production gigs.

From the drones and noise on
The Stooges’ self-titled album to the
lucid artistry of Patti Smith’s Horses,
which Cale produced, he never for-
got his musical past and has lived

to see numerous bands cite avant— -=

garde via the Velvet Underground
as a major source ‘of inspiration. The
different has neared the norm.
New York experimental rockers
Sonic Youth continue the mantra
today, adding a third bridge to their

guitars and preparing their instru— .

ments to create audible textures
otherwise unavailable.

Though it might be avant—garde,
it’s deﬁnitely still rock ’n’ roll.

Rohan returned the ﬁles with notes, leading

friends.

“On a scale of Stephenie Meyer to Stephen
King, she’s an F..Scott Fitzgerald,” Rohan said
in an e—mail. “I like the sense of raw urgency
coupled with the sleek, modern sensibility. Her
writing is well-dressed, which is a quality that ,
few modern writers possess.”

does its work to help you build this universe in
your mind.” .

With the book ﬁnally approaching release,
Rohan looks forward to seeing its impact.

“I envision it taking the genre in a new direc— ‘
‘ tion and really challenging preconceived con-

ceptions of the genre’s parameters, which until

now have been rather limiting,” she said.

creating the layout of the paperback edition

Squire continues to prepare for the ongoing
publishing and marketing process with man-
ager and publicist Latonia Hodo inAtlanta, who
is assisting with setting up book signings and
school readings. The book is “original,” Hodo
said, explaining that the novel ﬁts some clas-

genres but also reaches beyond them.

“There’s a lot happening in it,” Hodo said in
an e—mail. “It’s rapid, but it doesn’t rush through

Sims hits
1,000
points in
Pitt win

Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ Writer

After falling in four consecutive
contests, most recently a 4-point
overtime loss to .

Marquette, the Pitt women’s
basketball team was desperately
seeking a conference win.

They found it Tuesday night
against Cincinnati with an impres-
sive 79 -48 rout of the Bearcats at the
Petersen Events Center.

The offensive play of Panther se-
nior guard Jania Sims was equally
impressive. Sims contributed 24
points and, in doing so, reached
the 1,o00—point milestone in her
Pitt career.

Sims was the second Panther
to accomplish the feat this season
—- Taneisha Harrison earned her
1,o0o“‘ point on Dec. 11 againstVal-
paraiso. Sims is the 17”‘ Pitt player
to join the 1000'-point club in Pitt
women’s basketball history.

Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato
acknowledged Sims’ accomplish-
ment for the Panthers (10-11, 2-6)
after the game.

“I am very proud of Jania,” Be-
renato said. “It is great when good
people get rewards, and this is a
great rewar .”

Sims was not aware of how many
points she needed for the milestone
throughout the game, but she was
nonetheless pleased with the out-
come.

“This accomplishment feels so
good,” Sims said after the game. “I
have been in an offensive slump, so
it feels even better.”

Historically, Pitt has thrived
when Cincinnati (8-13, 1-8) comes
to town, and 'I‘uesday’s victory ex-
tended the Panthers’ winning streak
over the Bearcats to eight games.

The Panthers’ dominance was
evident early in the game. After
jumping out to an early 7-0 advan-
tage, the Panthers were able to build

Tomei achieves milestone in Panthers win

Pitt senior Ryan Tomei competes in a match against Lock Haven last season. Tomei recorded his looth collegiate win Sunday against Bloomsburg.

Wrestling ( 1

penalty points awarded for Boylan
locking hands and for an illegal
use of hands to the face. Zanetta
capped off the bout with a sweep-
single takedown for the win.

‘ “I always try to get the match
started off the right way,” Zanetta
said. “Not so much for myself, but
for the team. The energy level for
the fans and for the other guys,
it all plays into being the starting
guy. I like the role. It’s a little bit of
pressure on me and a little pres-
sure never hurt anyone.”

Stottlemyer said Zanetta es-
tablishes a rhythm for the other
Panthers on the team.

“That ﬁrst guy, he’s always got
to set the tone for us,” Stottlemyer
said. “Zanetta is a go-go-go guy.
’He’s always got energy and you
always want momentum coming
from that ﬁrst match.”

At one point during the match,
Huskies head coach John Stutz-
man argued calls with the referee
over the hands—to-the-face and
locking—hands penalties which cost
Bloomsburg a team point.

Pitt freshman Shelton Mack fol-

lowed up at 133 pounds with an-
other 6-4 victory. Mack was able
to win the bout without the use of
extra time. Heading into the third
period, Mack was down by a score
of 4-1 to fellow freshman Nick Wil-
cox. Mack used a bear hug toss to
take Wilcox to his back, scoring
ﬁve points with the throw.

With the Panthers leading 6-0,
Nauman picked apart freshman
Derek Shingara with a series of
takedowns on the way to a 15-4
major-decision victory.

At_157 pounds,‘ redshirt soph-
omore Donnie Tasser dropped a

close match to No. 26 Frank Hick- 2

man by a score of 7-6. Tasser, now
ranked No. 33 by the Coaches’ Pan-
el poll, lost the match on riding
time, after Hickman rode on top
for more than one minute.

Entering the 165—pound match,
the Panthers still held control with
a score of 13-2. Redshirt junior
Ethan Headlee came out on top
of a mostly defensive match with
No. 32_]osh Veltre. The victory was
Headlee’s team—leading 22nd of the
season.

Headlee, wrestling in his 12th
match at 165 pounds this season
after wrestling the rest of the sea-
son at 174 pounds, has amassed a
9-3 record since dropping weight
classes.

“It began really as an experi-
ment,” assistant coach Jason

_ Peters said earlier in the week
- about Headlee’s change of weight

class. “Ethan started losing a little
weight, and it really kind of solidi-
ﬁed itself. He started having some
success at 165 [pounds] and we
kept him there. In the past Ethan
has had the most success at that
weight so it was really all about

‘ getting him back to his most suc-

cessful spot.”

The Panthers held onto a
firm lead of 16-5 entering the
184—pound match. Freshman Max
Thomusseit scored a 3-1 decision
over Nate Graham. Thomusseit
required overtime to score the
winning single-leg takedown over
Graham.

At 197 pounds, senior Phil Sor-
rentino dropped a tough decision
to redshirt freshman Richard Perry

by a- score of 7-4. Sorrentino, who
has been ﬁlling in at 197 pounds
since Zac Thomusseit was injured,
wrestled another tough match, de-
spite being listed on the roster as
a 165-pounder.

Then Tomei took the mat _
with a career record of 99-32. He
dominated the bout with junior
Zac Walsh securing a 5-1 decision.
Tomei’s 100th win as a Panther
brought the Fitzgerald Field House
crowd to its feet to applaud the
heavyweight on his accomplish- ‘
ment.

Next up for the Panthers is the
wrestling installment of the Back-
yard Brawl, with a matchup Friday
night at home against West Virgin-

ia. The match is being promoted as .

“Fill the Fitz” for the rivalry.
“Anytime you wrestle West Vir-
ginia, it’s going to be fun,” Zanetta
said. “It’s going to be a great crowd
and a great time. You get pumped
up for those types of matches, I

think that’s when everyone wres— ‘

tles their best.” ‘

TH RQWINQ A KIRSCHBALL

Counting down the premier destinations for sports fans

Lauren Kirschman
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Everyone has a list of places they want to
see before they die — places to travel to,

. " Wonders of the World to take in and famous

buildings to explore and photograph.

But for sports fans, the list is a little dif-
ferent. Our lists are made up of sporting
events we want to attend. There are certain
ﬁelds and stadiums, certain atmospheres
that we just have to see and experience.be-
fore we no longer have the chance.

I’ve seen more than my fair share of
sporting events, and I’ve been fortunate
enough to check a few of those dream
destinations off my list. But my “Sports
Bucket List” is still pretty long. Here is just

" a part:

1. The Final Four — I’d love it if Pitt
were playing, but I’d settle for just attending
period. It’s the place to be in college basket-
ball. Nothing else really even comes close.
College basketball is my favorite sports
league, so there are few things more excit-
ing to me than the prospect of seeing the
last four teams battle it out for a National
Championship. ‘

2. Game seven of a World Series —— It
seems like a lot of my generation has forgot-

 

ten about America’s pastime in favor of foot-
ball, but I love this sport and I want to go to
a baseball game that means something. To
me, there are few moments in sports more
nerve—wracking and exciting than the end of
a close game seven. That’s something I want °
to experience in person. I don’t care which
teams are playing or where it is, although I

goose bumps to see in person.

4. Rose Bowl — “The Granddaddy of
Them All.” Of all the bowl games, this is the
one I want to go to. It’s held on New Year’s
Day in Pasadena, Calif., on what always
seems like the most perfect day humanly
possible, complete with a cloudless, bright-
blue sky. Add in 90,000 passionate fans and

would love to see the Pirates. _ L

3. Kansas basketball game on senior
night — Any game at Allen Fieldhouse
would do, but senior night is special. You’d
be hard pressed to ﬁnd a better overall at-
mosphere or a more knowledgeable fan
base. College basketball is life in Kansas
and who wouldn’t want to experience the
haunting Rock Chalk chant in person? On
senior night, the last-year players each give
a speech and roses decorate the ﬂoor. It’s
the kind of night that would give sports fans

— Texas vs. Oklahoma almost made this
list, but the Iron Bowl edged that game out.
There are few rivalries in college sports
more intense than Alabama vs. Auburn.

‘There is little doubt that the SEC is the best

conference in college football, and these
two perennially sit at the top of the confer-

ence. So not only is this a matchup between ‘

teams whose fans can’t stand each other,

but it’s usually a game between two of the .

nation’s top squads. Plus, it’s football in
the South —— where fans really love their
football.

Honorable mentions:

College World Series —— Like I said, I
love baseball. I’m also a huge fan of college
sports. This is the best of both worlds, and
it’s played annually in Omaha, Neb. My dad
has traveled to a lot of states for sporting
events and he still says Nebraska natives
were the nicest hosts. Great baseball and
good people? Sounds like a plan to me.

Kentucky Derby —- It’s the Kentucky
Derby. It’d be worth it to look at the hats
alone. But really, a horse race has to be an
incredible thing to see in person. Why not
take in a race on the sport’s biggest stage?

Field of Dreams — If you build it, they
will come. I sure would ifI was given the
chance. This isn’t really a sporting event,
but I still want to go. I want to throw a ball
around on the ﬁeld, too.

Super Bowl — Just to say I’ve done it.
I’m not the biggest NFL fan in the world,
which is why no pro—football events made
it very high on the list. But it’s still the Sn-
per Bowl and any sports fan can appreciate-
what attending an event as high—proﬁle as
this would mean. I7

TONY’S TOP 10

Best men’s college

   

Tonyjovenitti
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

In the words of the famous college

basketball commentator Dick Vitale,
6 this week was “upset city, baby!”

Top-10 men’s college basketball
teams Pitt, Duke, Connecticut, Vil-
lanova, Syracuse, BYU and San Diego

State all lost. And let’s face it -— that’s 4

why we all watch college basketball.
Besides cheering for your own team,
you watch to see if Wyoming can
maybe pull off the upset over a pe-
rennial top -10 power.

So in the spirit of upsets, here
are the top 10 upsets of tl1e 2010-11
season so far.

10. Stetson 89, Wake Forest 79.
This was one of the ﬁrst upsets of the
year. Itwas cute at the time, but itwas
actually a warning sign of just how
bad the ACC would be. The Demon
Deacons were the ﬁrst ACC team to
be upset by anon-Big Six conference
team, but they certainly weren’t the
last. Boston College lost to Yale and

to Kennesaw State. Big East fans
should rub it in this year while they
can, because we can’t expect: the ACC
to be this awﬁil for very long.

9. Temple 68, Georgetown 65.
This was a huge win for the Owls.
Granted, it wasn’t that big of a sur-
prise for Temple. The Owls typically
beat one top—1o team per year. But it

was a major home loss for George-

town, as the Hoyas allowed Ramone
Moore to put up 30 points for the
Owls. Luckily for Georgetown, the
Hoyas have bounced back, just re-
cently besting Villanova in Phila-
delphia.

8. Tennessee losing to every-
one. Tennessee truly looked like a
title contender at the beginning of
the year. The Volunteers won their
ﬁrst 10 games, including a big win
over Pitt. But then Tennessee went on
a losing spree — falling to Oakland,
Charlotte ‘and Charleston. The ﬁrst
loss was .shocking and excited the
college basketball world, but the next
several losses just left everyone shak-
ing their heads at the Vols.

7. Penn State 66, Michigan State

62. The Spartans were ranked No.

2 early in the season, but a brutal
schedule caused Tom Izzo’s team to
lose several games early on. All of
these losses were to ranked teams,
though, so they were understand-
able: But when the Spartans fell to
Penn State in Happy Valley, it led
everyone to think, “Maybe they’re
just not very good.”

6. New Mexico 86, BYU 77.
Brigham Young was a top—1o team
heading into the week. The Cougars
knocked off previously undefeated
No. 4 San Diego State on Wednesday.
But then they traveled to New Mexico
and suffered a huge letdown at the
hands of the Lobos.

5. Providence 83, Villanova
68. Providence has become quite
the giant-killer lately. The Friars have
never been that great, and so they
rarely contend for an NCAA Tourna-
ment spot —but somehow theyﬁnd
a way to knock off a quality, ranked

teamevery year. Two years ago, the —

Friars beat No. 1 Pitt, and last year

they beat No. 18 Connecticut. This.

year they beat No. 8 Villanova, right
after taking down No. 19 Louisville.

Syracuse was off to its best start in
years —— the Orange were 18-0 before
they fell to Pitt two weeks ago. But the
loss at the Pete sent the Orange into
a skid, and they have now lost four
straight. Losses to Pitt, Villanova and
Marquette are understandable, but
Syracuse getting crushed at home
by Seton Hall made for the biggest
upset in Big East play so far.

3. Illinois-Chicago 57, Illinois
54. This was the ultimate story of a
little brother ﬁnally besting  big
brother. Priorto the Flames’ victory
over the Illini, Illinois-Chicago had
only defeated Illinois once -— 21
years ago. The Flames came back
from eight points down in the second
halfto stun the 12th-ranked Illini.

2. St. _]ohn’s 93, Duke 78. The
Red Storm handed the Blue Devils
their second loss of the season, end-
ingaweekwhere the No. 2, No. 3, No.
4 and No. 5 teams in the rankings all
lost. Prior to the season, St. John’s
was many experts’ sleeper pick for
a Tournament bid, but after losing
to St. Bonaventure, St. Mary’s and
Fordham, the Red Storm fell off the
radar. » '

basketball upsets of the year ,9

Now St._]ohn’s is back on the map,
as the win over Duke marked the Red

’ Storm’s third victory over a top—10

team this year. It also ignited a lot

of conference debates. It’s tough Q

to judge conferences based on one
game, but it’s also tough not to notice
when the Big East’s 11th-place team
crushes the ACC’s best.

1. Marshall 75, West Virginia
71. This was simply the biggest feel-
good upset of the year. Perhaps this is

‘ just my Pitt bias, but the Thundering

Herd are always in the Mountaineers’
shadow — both in football and bas-
ketball. And after Marshall’s football
team came oh—so—close to knocking

off West Virginia, it was nice to see ,

the Thundering Herd ﬁnally pull
one off. . _

And oh yeah, Marhall’s head
coach — Pitt’s former assistant
coach Tom Herrion — got a bit of
revenge on the Mountaineers. If you
remember last year, when WVU de-
feated the Panthers in Morgantown,
an unruly crowd got so out of control

— that Herrion was hit in the face with

a coin. WVU, meet karma. 5

Rhode Island, and Georgia Tech lost

     

4. Seton Hall 90, Syracuse 68.

Panthers continue
  dominance over Cincinnati

Women’s basketball 4 13

Courtesy Pete Madia, Pitt Athletics

Pitt guard Jania Sims controls the ball against Cincinnati last night. Sims reached the
. 1,000-career—point mark with her 17 points in the game.

their lead to 37-19 before halftime.

The Panthers showed no intention of let-
ting the Bearcats back into the game during
the second half. A ﬁ1ll—court press coupled with

rebounding success allowed the Panthers to

limit the Bearcats’ scoring opportunities.
Pitt ﬁnished the game with 22 points off

turnovers and 39 rebounds, whereas Cincin- V

nati earned nine points from nine Pitt tum-
overs and secured 32 rebounds.

The Panthers’ nine turnbvers marks their

fewest this season.

Senior forward Chelsea Cole dominated the
glass with 14 rebounds. Cole currently ranks
ﬁrst inthe Big East in rebounds, averaging
more than nine per game. She also holds the
top spot in the conference for double-doubles,
earning her 11th against the Bearcats with
19 points.

Sims and Cole were joined by fellow senior.
Shayla Scott in double-digit scoring totals. ’

Scott turned in 15 points, including a perfect
3-for-3 from three-point range. Scott leads the
team with 33 three-pointers on the season-
Berenato noted that the play of Scott and
Cole was instrumental in securing the victo
for the Panthers. «
“Shayla and Chelsea worked the high—low
game as well as they have all year,” Berenato

said. “Chelsea was shooting well and that was ,

made possible by--Shayla’s—efforts.”v « « ~
Dressing only seven players due to team

injuries, Cincinnati has struggled all season,
dropping seven games in a row.

Senior Shareese Ulis has led the Bearcats
throughout the season with 15 points per

game, but the Panthers held her to just seven ,

points in Tuesday’s contest with their defen-
sive efforts.

Cincinnati guard Bjonee Reaves picked up
some of that scoring slack and was the leading
Bearcats scorer with 22 points. Reaves played

the entire 40-minute game forthe Bearcats. ‘

In contrast to the Bearcats -limited line-
up, all 11 players played for the Panthers.
The bench accounted for 14 of the ﬁnal 79
points. ‘

Pitt also took advantage of free-throw op-
portunities, converting 19 of its 21 attempts
for a 90.5 percent ﬁgure. Cincinnati earned 21
trips to the line, but managed only 13 points.

For Berenato, the win was one which
showed the resiliency of her team and its
ability to rebound after the tough loss to
Marquette.

“As a coach, you are not sure how your team
will respond after a heartbreaking loss,” Ber-

. enato said. “We have made improvements that

have not shown in the win-loss column, but
this game did and I am proud of the team.”
Hoping to earn their third conference vic-

. tory, the Panthers will travel to West Virginia
~ to-face their Big East rivals, the No. 14tMoun--

taineers, on Saturday. I
