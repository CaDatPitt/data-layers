c agreement

 

Irish politician says
peace is not final

Nora O'Neill
Staff Wrlter

Contrary to the thoughts of many
world leaders, peace has not arrived in
Ireland, at .least not according to a
major Irish political ﬁgure.

Gerry Adams, a member of the
British parliament and the president of
Sinn Fein, an Irish Republican party,
spoke to _a group of nearly 1,000 peo-
ple assembled at Duquesne University
Monday.

He discussed the years of injustice
that Catholics in Northern Ireland
have endured and compared their
struggle to the
civil rights move-
ment in_ the United
States. Although
he felt the forma-
tion of the
Northern Ireland
assembly was a
step in the right
direction, the
does"
not translate into
justice for Adams.

“The Good
Friday Agreement"
is the best thing
all the parties
could get at the
time,” said
Adams. “We put
together a range
of methods which
are about revers-
ing the discrimi-
nation and the

are about chang-

ing the social, economic, political and
cultural ethos in which we live in the
North of Ireland. It was about creating
a level playing field.”

Adams said he feels the violent
events of the summer — including the
fire—bombing that killed three small
children during the marching season
and the Omagh bombing that claimed
28 lives — serve as evidence that the
peace process still has a long way to
go.

“Peace isn’t just a cessation, isn’t
just the absence of conflict — it is the
presence of justice,” he said.

According to Adams, that justice
can be achieved if the individuals who

keep their word. They must follow
through with their promises regarding
the pullout of British troops, release of
political prisoners and police force
reform, he said.

Adams answered questions from
the audience about the likelihood of
the Nationalist and Unionist paramili-
tary groups keeping their end of the
agreement as well. He said he feels
that those groups would comply due to
the pressure of public opinion.

“The vast majority of the people
voted for it [the agreement], so the

answer to those ‘people in the loyalist

and factional
groups is that the
people want to
give this a

“They should fol-
_ low the example
of the IRA that has
called a cessation
and kept a cessa-
tion.”
Adams
voiced his appre-
ciation for the
C 1 i IL t o 11
Administration
and Senator
George Mitchell’s
interest in Ireland
and urged the
Irish-American
people to support
their _ ancestral
land’s quest for
freedom, unity
and indepen-
dence.

“It is my duty that we get that, but
now we need your help,” Adams said.
“We are here to try and enlist support
for peace and justice in our country.”

Adams said he feels that focusing
on the future is thekey to justice in
Ireland “This agreement is about the
children of Ireland,” he said.

For Adams to see the agreement as

valid, he said it must have a noticeable
effect on the daily lives of those young
people. He invoked the words of
Bobby Sands, a hunger striker and
Irish Patriot, to explain what he would
see as a successful agreement:

“Our revenge be the laughter ‘of
our children,” Adams quoted.

After renting enough hives to hold the

apple trees‘ and pruning the blossoms so
they would produce the biggest apples pos-

The family, owners of Buchholz

first Oakland farmers’ market held in
Panther Hollow near Joncaire Street. The

weather. After a winter break, the market
will resume in April.

CBS sports announcer will
speak at awards ceremony

Dan Sauder
Staff Writer

His name may not be as recog-
nizable as his voice, but in his busi-
ness that’s OK. '

“Everybody tunes in to watch the
game and not me,‘ except for maybe
my family,” said CBS sportscaster
Sean McDonough during a phone
interview from his home in Quincy,
Mass. ’

McDonough is the lead play-by-
play announcer for college football
on CBS and ‘has covered many other
sporting events during his eight-year
tenure with CBS, including some
Pirates baseball and Pitt football
games. '

McDonough and sports anchor
Bob Pompeani from KDKA-TV will

be talking college sports Wednesday ,

evening from 7 to 9 p.m in the
William Pitt Union.

The event is part of the Al
McDowell Media Forum, named in

‘honor of the late KDKA reporter

who, in memoriam, has a scholarship
funded through the English
Department at Pitt.

The scholarship is awarded annu-
ally to a student of English writing
chosen by the English department
faculty. McDonough will present the
award to this year’s winner during

his talk.

McDonough was pleased that he
was asked to speak at the assembly
and hopes he can live up to the .
expectations CBS correspondent Bob ;
Sheiffer set at last year’s discussion. g

. “News to sports is a little bit of al
difference. They dramatically went:
downhill from last year by choosing;
me,” McDonough joked. I

McDonough said he is looking
forward to the event and to his return 
to Pittsburgh. _i

“Whatever they want to talk I
about is open fire." [The question-

enjoy most,” he said.

McDonough should be in good:

form Wednesday night, since he said
he thinks this is probably the most‘
exciting time of the year for sports. _

back to Pitt since broadcasting last:
year’s Pitt football game against
Notre Dame. 1 -
“Pittsburgh is a nice city and I_
have a lot of respect for Pitt,” he
said. “Steve Pederson is a bright, go-

Anti-ga slurs stun Michigan State campus

Mary Sell

State News

EAST LANSING, Mich. (U-
WIRE) — Thursday, the rock on Farm
Lane became a canvas for hate—speech
directed at some Michigan State
University students.

On Wednesday, the Alliance of
Lesbian-Bi-Gay and Transgendered
Students painted the rock in honor of
National Coming Out Days, a celebra-
tion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans-
gendered people.

They woke Thursday morning to
see that the rock had been repainted
with anti—gay slurs. The front of the
rock read, “no packing zone.” Other
slurs on the rock and garbage can next
to it read, “I kill -fags,” “Kill ﬂames,”
and “Fags.” Those messages stayed on
the rock until after noon, when it was

V painted over by university workers.

“My first concern is the content of
the message. Advocating violence and
murder is a despicable one, -no matter
to whom it is directed,”said Val
Meyers, president of the Gay, Lesbian,
Bisexual and Transgender Faculty and
Staff Association.

Meyers said that seeing the mes-
sage. was like “hitting a brick wall.”

“It kind of makes you sick to your '

stomach,” she said, her voice cracking.

' “You go around all feeling that you are

respected as a human being. Then I
find out that people want to kill me,
not for anything I have done, but for
who I am.”

MSU police Chief Bruce ‘Benson
said police still are investigating the
matter. I 1

Thursday night, a group of lesbian,
bisexual, gay and transgendered stu-
dents, faculty, and supporters met to
discuss the issue. MSU President M.
Peter McPherson and Lee June, assis-
tant provost for academic student ser-
vices and multicultural issues, attend-
ed the gathering.

“I just wanted to be here to show
my support,” June said.

.McPherson, who left a few min-
utes into the meeting, has issued an
ofﬁcial statement saying, “I condemn
this hateful speech. This campus must
be a safe place where all can learn and
grow with dignity.”

Meyers said the reaction among
students is mixed. .

“Students are angry, they are hurt
and some of them are frightened,” she
said. 

More- importantly, she said, stu-
dents are more determined to speak out
on this injustice.

“The purpose of National Coming

‘Out Days is to educate people that

there is diversity on this campus,”she
said. a .
Brent Bilodeau, assistant for les-

bian—bisexual—gay and transgendered
concerns, said that Thursday’s meeting
was not the end of the issue.

“My hope is that this will be the
first of many discussions on hate
issues,” he said.

Bilodeau said that he went into the
discussion feeling upset, but left feel-
ing a lot of hope.

Penny Gardner, an American stud-
ies graduate student, said the writings
on the rock felt like a loss.

“It felt like a funeral. It felt a little
bit like a death,” said Gardner, a Gay,
Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender
Faculty and Staff Association board
member.

.Meyers said she was very pleased
with the response of the MSU police.

Elba Santiago-Labonte, assistant
vice president for student services and
director of Student Life, said that the

action today does not affect just les-

bian, bisexual, gay and transgendered
students. ‘ .

“I grieve what happened at the
rock today,” she said. “This intoler-
ance is not confined to just one group.”

If the person who painted the rock
is ever Caught, Gardner would know
what she’d say.

“I’d say, ‘Look at me. I’m your sis-
ter, I’m your mother, I’m your friend.’
That’s what I’d say.,’f she said.

Students incorporate first NAACP chapter at Harvard

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (U-WIRE) —
History was made Thursday night when
about 40 students of varied race and eth-
nicity came together in the Barker Center’s

Thompson Room to incorporate the ﬁrst-V

ever Harvard chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.

The meeting was the follow-up to a
meeting held the previous week with
Julian Bond, the NAACP’s national chair-
man. At the earlier meeting, Bond stressed
that the NAACP is not just an organization
for blacks, and encouraged people of all

own notions about the NAACP.

Latham said the organization is differ- -
ent from ethnic organizations on campus ‘

simply because “it is not an ethnic organi-
zation. It is just the hub of a bicycle wheel.
It is for anyone who’s interested in the

“[The NAACP] is for the

Driskell said the organi-

that “it’s not a social club.”
Tawney B. Pearson said she hoped the
chapter would serve as an umbrella orga-
nization, connecting related groups in the
college and the various graduate schools.
“I think it will take on [the task of a]
minority students’ alliance throughout the
entire University,” she said.

a central group to handle problems that had -

previously been shufﬂed between groups.

“Ihese are everybody’s problems,”
she said. “We can’t just push them aside as
problems of speciﬁc groups.”

One possible obstacle the chapter
faces is the university’s refusal to recog-
nize nationally afﬁliated student groups.
Hazel T. Edney, moderator of 'Ihursday’s
meeting and a KSG student, said the group
plans to forge ahead whether or not it is
oﬂicially recognized. '

“This should in no way be construed
as an attack on Harvard,” she said. “It is an
attempt to make Harvard a better place.”

In her opening remarks, Edney cited
several statistics and recent incidents as
evidence of discriminatory policies and
mindsets in _ the Boston area and at
Harvard.

Roberta D. Edwards, a KSG student
who also ran for chapter president, told the
group in her speech that she was ﬁred from
her job at the Metropolitan Boston Transit
Association for actively advocating civil

rights. She also pointed to hearings held by '
the Boston City Council Thursday to_
: reconsider existing affirmative action

employment programs in-the city’s ﬁre and
police departments.
Edwards said the dynamic nature of

. Harvard makes its chapter especially like-

ly to be at the forefront of change. “ T h e
success of the civil rights movement hap-
pens. because of the support of college stu_—'
dents,” she said.

Rev. Jamal Bryant, national youth‘

director for the NAACP, agreed that the
university would lose out on a crucial
opportunity by failing to open a chapter.

“I think, in that Harvard is allegedly
the larnplight of progressive thinking in the
nation, to have students forward intellectu-
ally and backward socially would be a
grave hypocrisy,” he said.

Latham said Cambridge’s NAACP
chapter exists in name only, making the
task even tougher — and even more essen-
tial -— for Harvard students.

Sophomore Chanda K. Ho said she
thinks the organization will pack more
clout because of its multi-dimensional
demographic diversity. ,

“It’s important that you have an orga-
nization that works to promote social
equality and racial justice not just for a
speciﬁc ethnic group but for all people,”
said Ho, who is Asian American. “Because
there are grad students involved as well as
undergrads, we will have more resources
andiwill be able to get more done.

“Minority and racism are becoming
buzzwords. Instead of acting on them we
just talk about them. The NAACP can help
us ﬁnd commonalities and move in the
direction_of truly dismantling racism.”

Both Edney and Latham noted the
importance of a diverse and inclusive
membership body.

, “We need everyone’s energy and
everyone’s support,” Latham said.

McDonough was also in town for
what he ‘deemed one of themost

cast ——‘ game seven of the National
League Championship Series in
1992, which pitted the Pirates
against the Atlanta Braves. .

— In addition, McDonough broad
cast the 1993 World Series game in
which Joe Carter hit a home run to
clinch the championship for the Blue

University and Duquesne University joined
community residents who browsed through
the market.

Farmers offered pumpkins, fresh
honey, pies and various meat products, in
addition to the standard fare such as apples,
pears and peaches. Shoppers left with full
bags. A , _ i _ ‘ '

“We enjoy working with city people,
and we’re learning as much as you are,”
said Elaine Steele, a farmer who ‘sold her
dairy herd a few years ago in order to start
Purity Pork Products.

A lot of the produce for sale at the mar-
ket was grown without the use of pesticides
or other chemicals. Joe Krill, of Schramm’s
Farms and Orchards in Westrnoreland
County, said that is just the way it should be.

“There ought to be a law passed so gro-
cery stores, in [their] produce sections, are
required to post signs with the country or

origin of fresh vegetables and fruits so you
know where they’re coming ﬁom,” he said.

“In the United States, we are heavily regu- _

lated. Home—grown vegetables are better
for you since in places like Mexico, they
use pesticides.”

Betty Sam agreed, saying the vegeta-
bles her family grows— on their farm are
chemical—free. But they have no choice
other than to spray their apple trees to pre-
vent disease and worms.‘ _

She said her son insists ‘that “every-

body eats with their eyes and not with their V

mouths,” thus the need to present the ﬁnest—
looking fruit. '

Krill added that supermarket prices are
another reason to buy produce at local mar-
kets.

“Go to Giant Eagle and compare the-
' prices,” Krill said when one customer com- V

plained his prices were too high. “You go to

a local supermarket and you’ll pay a  L:

more for a lot less.” 
5 Some people said that the farrnersff

market was more convenient than going tr 

the grocery store. I.
g “I live on Centre Avenue and this is In;

short cut to the Parkway [East],” said Bo’ 1 
Peters, manager of the Chalfont Apartment - ' _
in North Oakland. “I think it’s a good ides 

that there is some place close by here.”

The_ farmers all agreed the Oaldan; 
market would provide them with a needeu~'_ ‘ ;
opportunity to sell more of their products; s .

Starn said the tornadoes this sprin
damaged a lot of crops. 

“The hail made marks on a lot of -‘thni
apples,” she said.. . ,

Congress last week to pass the
Federal Hate Crimes Prevention
Act, saying that “there is nothing
more important to the future of
this country than our standing
together against intolerance,
prejudice and violent bigotry.”

‘ The very premise of National
Coming Out Week proves that
having to admit one is homosex-
ual is still a harrowing prospect.
This should not be so.
Homosexuals should not have to
fear for their lives just for the
sake of their sexual preference.

The intolerance in America
needs to stop. Now.

Marriott: a corporation one loves to hate

It seems to be a curse of universities that
they, like elementary andhigh schools, have
to suffer student complaints about the food.
Nearly everyone on this campus has gripes

about Sodexho - its decision to change the A

meal -plan, its inﬂated prices that in some
locations are not even posted, etc. .

I’m going to put aside this line of whin-
ing for now, but I’m nevertheless going to
complain about our campus food-service
contractor — only this time the complaint is
substantial. _

. As is well-known, Sodexho merged with
Marriott last year. And Marriott, as should be
well-krrown, is one of the most notoriously
anti-union employers in the country. The
company pulls out all the stops to ensure that
none of its employees can unionize. The few
Marriott hotels that are unionized had unions
in place before the corporation
bought them, and no union has yet
won a contract while the company
owned and operated a hotel.

In the labor movement,
though, there are always some
people who are willing to challenge the‘ odds.
I have before me a series of_ articles by David
Bacon, an independent labor reporter based
in California. He tells the story of the work-
ers at the Marriott hotel in downtown San
Francisco, who have been ﬁghting for a

' union _ contract for an incredible 18 years.
When the hotel’s construction was ﬁrst pro-
posed in 1980, the company agreed to hire
local residents and promised not to interfere
with union-organizing attempts. When the
hotel opened in 1989, Local 2 of the Hotel
and Restaurant Employees Union sought to
organize the employees. Predictably,
Marriott violated its agreement and fought
with the union in court. '

It took until 1995 for the hotel to agree in
writing to a recognition process in which the
hotel would refrain ’ from campaigning
against the union and recognize it if an arbi-
trator certiﬁed that a majority of its 1,000-
plus employees had signed union cards.
When the organizing campaign began in
January 1996, the hotel immediately violated
the agreement again, holding no fewer than
22 mandatory employee meetings to intimi-
date them into not signing union cards. This

did not break the workers’ resolve, however,
and in August 1996, organizers began hand-
ing out union cards. Within eight days, they
had a majority, and the union was recog-
nized. ‘

The time arrived for contract negotia-
tions, but the hotel has been stalling ever
since. In January 1997, the hotel raised the
wages of its non-union employees, such as
clerical workers, engineers and others. In the
fall of that year, management held mandato-
ry meetings in which workers were. told,
effectively, that they would receive raises if
the union went away. Around the same time,
non-union employees began circulating a
petition to decertify Local 2. Hotel human
relations director Donna Shepherd denies
that hotel management -had any connection to
the petition — which would be highly illegal
.— yet workers have reported that
the non-union employees circulat-
r ing the petition have been provid-
ed with computer printouts listing
the names and working hours of
union employees.

Marriott’s conduct has been so gratu- -

itously illegal that the hotel is likely to be
cited even by this conservative National
Labor Relations Board. Earlier this month,
the hotel reversed its previous policy by
increasing the wages and health beneﬁts of
Local 2 members. Shepherd — for whom the
brazen lie has become the equivalent of a
daily prayer. — denies that the raise was
designed so the hotel could avoid unfair
labor-practice charges. Local 2 still does not
have a contract, but union activists have sol.-
diered on, courageously in the face of palpa-
ble management hostility and appear to have
halted the decertiﬁcation campaign.

The lesson I am trying to draw out of all
of this is that a proﬁt-seeking corporation’
that has been so duplicitous with its workers
is not likely to be honest or fair with anyone

else. This is as good an argument _as any for '

the practice of solidarity, even if — -in Upton
Sinclair style — I may be aiming for the stu-
dent body’s heart and hitting its stomach.

John Lacny is for waging uncompromising

ideological struggle against the Trotskyite ‘

Wreckers.

A night at the Opera
Poem by Kevin Carey

It’s a wednesday, and my forearms are sore. who

I arrived moments ago, drunk from the antics of

‘ a good ol’ wensy eve!

the same “bloody” alley that I damn near watch
a ‘cat o’mine fall to, cat, tha’s right, a cat. ’

meow no more, for that’s too damn cool fo dis

“ what’s dealin’_? , ,

waiting for a promised land? possibly, but, prob-

Kevin Carey

Columnist

In so many ways, what you’ve just read is poem. I
prefer to see it as an exploration, an insight of what I have
come to classify as “urban dank poetry.” The title seems
trite; in fact, it is. But for me, it holds a signiﬁcant amount
of truth, for I have walked many a city street. Yes, it is a
bizarre confession to make, but a true one nonetheless,
and my interpretation of the truth is the oxygen that per-
mits such poetry to exist. .

It’s an exploration, it’s not a worthless pile of ebonics
puked up by some f--ing Irish Catholic white boy. It’s
about the artist, his scene and the serpent that feeds him:
a pragmatical circle of chaos that every artist must sur-
vive. .

I grew up in South Oakland ——' in fact, on the same
street as Darmy (everybody’s All—American) Marino. As
a young boy, my brothers and I watched Darmy smoke on
the comer. We strolled through the streets stepping over
drunken panhandlers. We are the products of the city.

My friend Eric and I are notorious for spotting pan-
handlers a beer, pulling up a seat on a termite-infested
porch, and ensuing conversation with those  bas-
tards that jingle the cup.” You should try’it some time —
it is indeed the cornerstone of my poetry. It’s a ﬂavor of
storytelling; it is no different from that of the folk singer.

Our poetry, like any poetry, is an exhibition of the power .

that “wor ” contains. .

This is our exploration, the era that is upon’ us. It
delves into all human emotion, and the product that fol-
lows is nothing more than astory. '

Kevin Carey remains, until next time, down and out in

South Oakland, real close to bein’ up.

 

  October means
sports dominate
the scene '

It’s October. V

Sports are taking over the country right
now. Baseball playoffs. NHL hockey.
NCAA football. NFL football.

There is even a slight chance that we
will see some professional basketball. As I
began to dwell on all of these sports, I
thought I would pass on some of my feel-
mgs.
In the major—league“baseball playoffs,
I must say that I am rooting for whatever
team the Atlanta Braves are playing. I have
hated the Braves since they defeatedthe
Pittsburgh Pirates in the NLCS in 1991 and
1992. I watched Andres Galarraga hit a

. grand slam Sunday to keep the Braves

alive against the San Diego Padres, and I
got ﬂashbacks to the nightmares of
Francisco Cabrera against Stan Belinda in
1992. Therefore, I am cheering against
Atlanta. '

The Yankees seem to have the best sto-

ryline, since they set the AL record for

wins. In addition, they have the ‘added

.motivation of Darryl Strawber1y’s ﬁght

with colon cancer. .
Cleveland hasn’t won the World Series

. since the days of Dwight Eisenhower. The
Indians are the team everyone writes off,

but they somehow ﬁnd a way to win. They
had the Yankees in a tight spot, but New
York came back to win games four and ﬁve
over the weekend to take_a 3-2 lead back to
Yankee Stadium. ‘

Intl1eend,Itl1inkImayhavetopull
for the San Diego Padres. San Diego’s
65,000-plus crowds for the last few games
at Qualcomm Stadium have epitomized
the great American game of baseball. It
would be a ﬁtting end to the summer of ‘98'
if the Padres could clinch the World Series
in front of those crazed fans.

Saturday night marked the start of the
NHL season. It will be interesting to see
what happens to the Pittsburgh Penguins.
The Pens are in a new division this year,
which will make it a lot tougher for them to
win another division title under Kevin

, Constantine. Jaromir J agr has accepted the
. “C” on his jersey after the departure of Ron

Francis, but many people don’t feel that he
can handle the role. I am one of the few
who think that the Pens will thrive under
adversity this year. I’m not saying they will
overtake New Jersey and Philadelphia to
win the division, but I don’t think they will
be far behind. -

negotiated the agreement that got the Pac
10 and the Big Ten into the new Bowl

Harris tries to explain Pitt’s|ac of ofensive

David Turner
Staff Wrlter

After a week—long vacation from
having to justify the poor execution
of his offense, head football coach
Walt Harris has quickly returned to

. his normal routine.

“We’re shooting ourselves in the
foot with execution mistakes and
some turnovers,” Harris said yester-
day at his weekly press conference.

Saturday’s 29-10 loss to North

_ Carolina featured five UNC sacks for
‘ a total loss of 47 yards and three
Pittsburgh fumbles. ,
. Harris also said he was disap-
pointed with “the inability to mount
2 a consistent running attack.” Pitt
gained only 48 yards on the ground..
Senior quarterback Matt Lytle
received mixed reviews from his
coach. Harris put a‘ great deal of
blame on Lytle for a sack he took in
Pitt’s end zone in theethird quarter - a
play that gave « North Carolina
momentum for the remainder of the
game.

“The safety was, without ques-
tion, not a play that should ever have
happened,” Harris said. “He ﬂubbed
up on that play big time.”

But it was the success of the
quarterback option which, for second
time in three games, earned Lytle
praise from Harris.

“I thought we ran the option from
the quarterback position about as
well as we’re ever going to run it. He
did a great job on the option,” Harris
said.

 Harris plans to make some offen-
‘ _V sive changes for Saturday’s
’ j Homecoming _‘ game against the

I" 7.: Rutgers Scarlet Knights, including
»i"-"moving freshman fullback Mark,
Moothart up the depth charts over ‘V

1 “freshman Rickey Mendenhall.
“We can’t -turn the ball over,”

A Harris said of ‘his decision. “That’s

it.” v .
Nearly lost in all of the offensive
_ troubles of the team was the news
 that Pitt’s defense moved up one spot
‘to ninth in the NCAA, allowing its
opponents 270.6 total yards per
game.

Onereason for the high national
ranking has been the play of junior
‘cornerback Hank Poteat, who now is
ranked first in the Big East and sec-
ond in the country with four inter-
ceptions. l

“The one thing that he will do, he
will intercept the football,” Harris
said proudly. “Anytime you’re
nationally ranked I think that
makes a quarterback coach or offen-
sive coordinator tend to try to throw
it to the other side.”

He also praised Poteat’s efforts

on special teams as a kick returner.
Poteat averages 22.5 yards per
return. '
Returning to another common
theme, Harris talked about the
impact the 12th Man and a big
Homecoming crowd at Pitt Stadium

'' could have on Saturday’s game.

“Our goal is to make this a tough
place to play for the opponents,” he
said. “And ‘as was witnessed in one
game so far this year, it was obvious-
ly a tough game for the opponent to
play in. But that’s up to us, too. We
have got to provide the excitement

, and the enthusiasm and the results in

order-to get people to come out.”

The biggest meet of the year is
over for Pitt’s men’s.and women’s
cross country teams. The Panthers
25th Paul Short
Invitational at Lehigh University
Oct. 3. '

Forty-three men’s teams and 39
women’s teams competed in_ the
meet, including some nationally
ranked squads. ‘

“It’s a meet that will have nation-
al implications further down the
road,” said Pi-tt head coach Dave
Sobal.

The race may have especially
important implications in the state of
Michigan. In the men’s race, the
University. of Michigan and
Michigan State tied for first place,
each with 90 points. The Wolverines’
won the tiebreaker with their sixth
runner finishing ahead of Michigan
State’s.

In the women’s race, Cornell fin-
ished in first place, comfortably

ahead of a group of five tightly

packed teams.

For both the men and the women,
the race went exactly as Sobal
thought it would.

“I told [the runners] before the
race that you’re going to be running
really fast and not even know it

because you’re buried in the pack,”
Sobal said.

"The men proved Sobal’s predic-
tion to be true. All five Panthers who
competed set personal records, led by
Mike Orzechowski’s time of 25:32.2
for the. eight-kilometer course. Still,
Orzechowski’s time left him buried
in 124th place. None of the other men
placed in the top 200.

As a team, the men placed 37th
out of 43 teams, scoring 1,120 points.

“We scored a lot of points, but
when all five guys have a PR‘ [per-
sonal record], you can’t say anything
bad,” Sobal said. _

The women didn’t set any
records but still ran fast times. Pitt’s
top finisher was Lauren Fittz, who
finished the five—kilometer race in
18:40.4. That time put_ her in 90th
place overall.» Wendy Lampart
stormed out of theipack to finish sec-
ond among Pitt runners and 137th
overall with a time of 19:04.9.

“That was a very very competi-
tive race,” Sobal said. “Our women
ran pretty fast, but everybody ran
fast.” ' '

Last Saturday, the women trav-
eled to St. Francis College to com-
pete in the Red Flash Invitational,»

The depleted men’s team did not
run. With only four healthy true dis-
tance runners, _Sobal felt that it was-
n’t a good idea to enter the team in an
unnecessary race.

“It’s a tough course. The guys
didn’t- need that added stress. The
women run the shorter distance and

can recover quicker, so we sent them. .

And the women responded well at
that meet,” Sobal said.

The women recovered well
enough from the Lehigh meet to win
at St. Francis, edging Duquesne by a
score of 33-37, despite having three

of the team’s top-six runners injured , ’

and unable to compete. ,
“I thought we could "win any-

way,” Sobal said. “We needed all five

runners to do it.” I
Fittz and Lampart were the top-

' two finishers in the race, with times

of 19:24 and 19:30. Both were run-
ning on the course for the first time,
which affected their strategy.
“Lauren wanted to run behind the
top runner from St. Francis for a

I while,’’ Sobal said. “About a half-

mile into the race, Lauren decided
she was too slow, so she took the lead
and led the rest of the way.”

Another Lady Panther, Amanda
Schmidt, finished fifth in the race

with a time of 19:59. Tamika Dorin .

and Chantee Earl, both of whom are
better known as half-milers on the
Pitt track team, sealed the victory for
the Panthers. They finished .12th and
13th with times of 20:45 and 20:46
respectively.

Championship Series should  ﬁred. In
previous years, the Rose Bowl pitted tl1e
Big Ten champion against the Pac 10

champ. This year, that would amount to a-

rnatchup of top—ranked Ohio State and
number-two «UCLA. However, under the
new agreement, the Fiesta Bowl gets the
top’ two teams at the end of the season. So
instead of having the dream matchup of
number one versus number two, the grand-
daddy of them all is now faced with a
matchup that could feature a team like
Florida State or Kansas State. Nothing
against those schools, but I’m sure that the
Rose Bowl would much rather have the
Buckeyes and the Bruins.

When it comes to the NFL, all that has
been on my mind for the past 24 hours is
Sunday’s Steelers-Bengals game. You

THE Pin NEws

would think that if these professional foot-
ball players are getting paid millions of dol-
lars for the game, they could at least play
the whole time. At the end of Sunday’s con-
test, the Steeler defenders were caught
sleeping as Neil O’Donnell completed two
big passes to’ Carl Pickens to lead the
Bengals to the upset. Now the Steelers face
the prospect of being two games behind the
Jacksonville Jaguars, pending the outcome
of the Jacksonville-Miami Monday night
game.

Dewayne Washington was the player
Pickens beat on both of the passes on the
ﬁnal drive, but he should not have to shoul-
der all of the blame. The Steelers comn1it—
ted 11 penalties, which isunacceptable. The
defensive ‘ line put no pressure on
O’Donnell during that last drive. Any true
Steeler fan knows what happens to
O’Donnell when you put pressure on him.

The outcome of that game is a shame,‘

because the Steeler offense tumed in its
most consistent performance of the year.
Kordell Stewart returned to his multi-
dimensional role, with 103 rushing yards
on the afternoon. Jerome Bettis and
Richard Huntley each ran well behind a
makeshift oﬁensive line that featured two
players making their ﬁrst starts of the year.

All I’m asking for is effort. If the

Steeler defense would have shown half the
effort the Pitt Panther defense did against

Penn State, the Bengals wouldn’t have
been close at the end of the game. Guys like
Phil Clarke and Hank Poteat are out there
playing their hardest, and they aren’t even
getting paid. I guess that shows you what
money does to someone. '
