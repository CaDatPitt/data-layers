To Our Readers: In this space, The Pitt News was going to run a story,
which said that Governor Nelson Rockefeller, a Presidential candidate, would speak
at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow on the Unicersity’s Student Union porch.

But the good Governor changed his mind AGAIN. He will not be here.
Instead, he switched his engagement to Penn State at noon tomorrow.

For those readers who still want to see the good Governor, he will be in
Pittsburgh between 4 and 5 p.m. at the Hilton Hotel.

That is, if he doesn ’t change his mind.

On the Scene Report

Lack of Communication Causes Columbia Protest ”

by MIKETBROURMAN
NEW YORK-—-Columbia Uni-
versity is a complex of red brick
buildings separated f r om the

teeming ghetto of Harlem by an,

iron fence. That fence has sym-
bolized more than the physical
separation of Columbia from its
neighbor. It has also come to
stand for the lack of communi-
cation between the two commun-
ities.

Never was the communications
gap more evident than in the
controversy surrounding the gym
that Columbia proposed to build
in Harlem's Morningside Park;
the controversy that ignited the
spark which touched off the ex-
plosion that rocked Columbia
three weeks ago. And the fires
from that explosion have not
simmered down in the interven-
ing period.

However, the Columbia gyrn

controversy did not cause the
melee at the University; it was
merely the cataylst. An eruption
had been building for over a
year and the eventual connection
of that eruption to Columbia's
problems with Harlem was mere
ly by chance.

For over a year the Students
for a Democratic Society has

i been fomenting unrest at C0--

lumbia. During that span their
activities have become increas-
ingly more bold.

The explosion that finally took
pla c e was the culmination of
those activities. And, it came
about primarily for two reasons.
First, the administration at C0-
lumlbia continually appeased SDS
and its brother organizations.

Second, the administration fail-
ed to correct the legitimate grie-
vances that students had against
the structuring of the school; grie-
vances that SDS exploited in its
bid for power. The administration
failed to open channels of com-

munication with the students,
just as it similarly failed with
Harlem.

A year ago, SDS forcibly occu-
pied Dodge Hall, one of the com-
plex of campus buildings. Only
one of the demonstrators was
given any type of punishment-—
a one term suspension.

The Committee for the Defense
of Property Rights, another Co-
lumbia organization warned the
administration that such appease-
ment “will be an ominous prece-
dent for the future of Columbia
as an institution of learning. The
disruption of our lives will grow
with every temporization, every
acquiesence, every appeasement."

As it turned out, they were
right. SDS became increasingly
more bold. Shortly later, another
campus room was forcibly occu-
pied. SDS was learning that co-
ercient worked at Columbia.

Late last year SDS demanded
that the university cancel the
scheduled recruiting interviews
by the U. S. Army. The admin-
istration cancelled them.

“That was a typical SDS move,”
said one student. “They believe
in freedom and democracy—the
freedom to agree with SDS and
the right to do what they say.”

Bolstered by their successes,
SDS announced a shift in tactics
from protest to “active resist-
ance.” A number of incidents
took place, and the administra-
-tion acted with token or no pun-
ishment.

At the same time that law

Columbia, nothing was being done
to correct the real problems that
exist. The university’s antiquated
structure is not conducive to the
necessary dialogue between stu-
dents, faculty,. and administra-
tion. There is a great lack of
communication.

However, the administration
made no real changes in the
structure, and the communication
gap is even wider today.

SDS inspired mob rule erupted
at Columbia three weeks ago.
Five buildings were occupied, uni-
versity officials were imprisoned,
and offices were vandalized. Edu-
cation was brought to a total
halt. After six days of such rule,
the demonstrators were forcibly
ejected by police.

But, order has not returned to
Columbia. Classes are still shut
down, and daily confrontations
take place between supporters
and opposers of the demonstra-
tion.

Support for SDS is meager both
on the Columbia campus and in
the New York area. 710 students
took part in the demonstration;
26,000 did not.

Most of those 26,000 still show
up at Columbia every day, al-
though they have no classes.
They ride the subway and en-

ter the gate at 116th Street. Then.

they mill about. “I’m just hop-
ing that something will happen
and the school will open again,”
said a Barnard girl. “That’s why
we're all here.”

Nothing happened last Friday.

SDS took its customary position
on the steps of the barricaded
Low Library and launched a mas-
sive oral tirade against the whole
structure of American society.
The national secretary delivered
an incomprehensible speech re-
lating all the trouble to the Mar-
shall Plan.

Fifty supporters of SDS sat on
the setps at Lo wand applauded
methodically. About twice that
number of students stood around
and heckled. Most people just
ignored the whole thing.

An SDS sponsored booth was
trying to sell copies of a maga-
zine sponsored by the Socialist
Workers Party with out success.
The SDS Mathematics Commune,
a tent set up outside the barri-
c aded Mathematics building
stood slightly bent by the brisk
wind. Surrounding it were red
flags and signs proclaiming that
“Lenin won, Fidel won, We will
win.”

A booth sponsored by the Com-
mittee for the Defense of Prop-
erty Rights was doing a big bus-
iness selling various buttons. The
“Stop SDS Fascism” button sold
out at 50 cents apiece. “I am a
SCAB” pins and buttons boost-
ing SDS leader Mark Rudd for
Fuehrer were doing well. In one

hour 400 signatures were obtain-
ed for a petition to expel all 710
demonstrators from school.

But although the backlash was
much bigger than the frontlash,
most students were ignoring
both. They walked around or eat
on the grass. They chatted and
tried to laugh. The laugh was
hollow.

Columbia was closed. SDS had
succeeded in causing chaos. The
administration had failed to take
decisive action on all fronts. And,
the losers were 26,000 stunned
students.

Gulf of Tonkin Controversy

Reports Hit Invalidit

I-‘uurl/I Purl 0] l“lH' 171"’ ~“"'l""'

by PAUL STOLLER, EDITOR
The initial bombing of North Vietnam was directly related to
the alleged naval incident in the Gulf of Tonkin. In the short span
of six hours the Johnson Administration decided that it was certain
that the attack had taken place. But there are a great many distor-
tions and innacuracies in the evidence presented by the administra-

tion which cloud the actuality of
the second attack.

In reporting the government
evidence to the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Secretary
McNamara presented a seemingly
cogent and convincing case prov-
ing the validity of the second at-
tack, However, with careful ex-
amination of these points another
conclusion is quite obvious-the
second attack did not occur!

Mr. McNamara contended that
the ships radar sets had reported
a number of vessels that were
shadowing their course. Eyewit-
ness reports, however, reveal con-
fusion rather than certainity
about McNamara’s claim. Cap-
tain Robert Barnhart, the skip-
per of the Turner Joy said: “As
I turned to see it (radar blip),
we picked up another contact
12,000 yards astern. We opened
up fire again and the contact
went off the scope.”

IT IS SOMEWHAT strange for
radar contacts to suddenly blip
on and off radar scopes. This,
to be sure, provided a great deal
ofconfusion on board the Mad-
dox. None. of this information,
however, wasover mentioned by
Secretary McNamara.

The data concerning these ra-
dar contacts becomes more sig-
nificant when the odd events on
board the Maddox are described.
While the radar scopes of the
Turner Joy were filled with
blips, the Maddox’s radar failed
to make any contact. Oddly
enough, the two ships were only
six miles apart. In fact, the Mad-
dox did not fire a single round
during the alleged incident.

Adding to the confusion, Mad-
dox Weapons Officer James Con-
nell believed that the radar blips
were really US aircraft. “We
called in for air support, and

we concluded that those were

aircraft coming in, dodging
through the periphery of our
surface search radar. We dis-
covered that this was our own
aircraft coming through.”

THUS, ACCORDING to an eye-
witness, Mr. McNamara’s enemy
contacts‘ were US aircraft giving
air support to the Maddox and
Turner Joy. ‘

Mr. McNamara also maintain.
ed that the ships reported that
they Were under a “continuous
torpedo attack." But this claim
is innacurate. Most of the men
of board the Maddox believe
that most of the torpedo reports
were actually “noise spokes”
Caused by the movement of the
ship at high rates of speed. This
fact caused some doubt as to the
actual presence of targets on
August 4. Lieutenant John Lee-
man was in charge of the Mad-
dox sonar room that night and
he didn"t know if there were
targets in the Gulf A that‘ night,
“I don’t know, I really don’t
know,” he said.

Even Commodore Herrick ad-
mitted his doubt. “I think we
were picking up some of our own
noises.” However, H e r r 1 c k
whisrtled another tune, today.

ALL OF THE statements of the
eyewitnesses maintain that there

was a great deal of confusion
concerning details of the second
incident. How could the Mad-
dox be certain that they were
under a “continuous torpedo at-
tack“ when their sonar sets were
reporting sounds that were admit-
tedly being made by the hull of
the ship? Mr. McNamara offered
no explanation for this, because
he simply chose not to mention
it in his testimony.

The Defense Secretary report-

ed to the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee that the ships
had reported small weapons fire
and specifically that the attack-
1118 ‘craft was using three inch
guns against the Maddox and
the Turner Joy. One begins to
wonder about the credibility of
the Defense Secretary's testimony
when Captain Barnhart, an eye-
witness, said that his ship, the
Turner Joy, was not fired on by
machine guns (or any other
weapons) all night. Captain Barn-
hart did not know of any firings
of automatic weapons.

What was true of the Turner
Joy was also true of the Maddox.
Maddox Skipper Herbert Ogier
reported that no small weapons
fire had~been directed at his
ship. Here again, it is quite clear
that Mr. McNamara did not.real-

The March

Demonstrators participating in the Poor People’s March.

on Washington will be coming through Pittsburgh tomorrow.
Originally, the city agreed to house the demonstrators in the
Hunt Armory. This facility, however, seemed inadequate to
Rev. Donald W. Mcllvane, one of the campaign’s directors.

Rev. Mcllvane maintained that “its (Hunt Armory) facil-
ities are very much inadequate; furthmore, there are no near-
by eating units to accommodate the marchers.”

Reacting to this situation, a number of faculty membersi
and SG President Ken Schueler recommended to the Univer-
sity that itprovide a number of the 1400 9acant rooms avail-
able in the quadrangle and Tower A.

Rev. McIlvane,.when confronted with this offer, made
it quite clear that the Poor People’s Campaign would be will-'
ing to pay the University for all expenses incurred. They
have raised $2,500 for this very purpose.

Responding to these requests, the University has agreed
to supply 200 rooms and food service to the incoming march-
ers. We must maintain, however, that the University should
supply more rooms to the marchers. '

SG President Ken Schueler recently stated that “we all
recognize the need for an urban university to act as a innovat-
ing force within its own community.” Is the University act-
ing. as an innovator when it merely supplies 200 rooms out
of a total of 1,400?

The Poor People’s Campaign is a non-violent march
whose goals seek out social justice for the disadvantaged.
This is a worthy cause that must be supported fully by the
University. An urban university must take cognizance to the
dire problems of the poor. It is with this in mind that The
Pitt News and Student Government demand that more of the
unoccupied rooms in the dormitories be made available to
the incoming marchers.

Columbia Protest

The protest strike at Columbia University sparked a new
phase of student demonstrations—the forceful take-over of uni-
versity buildings by student groups.

Bob Fitzgerald, a member of the Strike Steering Com-
mittee at Columbia, suggested that student demands were
not being met by Columbia’s Administration. He maintained
that students “want a voice and a certain kind of power-
power to determine the type of environment they live under.”

The PittNews must agree with Fitzgerald’s ideals but
we strongly disagree with his tactics. University students

Students, to be sure, must ‘take part in the decision making
process-on their respective campuses. But students must also
respect the tenets of our societal heritage.

Society guarantees us the rights of free speech and
thought. These rights carry with them a responsibility—the
responsibility of not impinging on the rights of others.

Those individ-uals who actively participated in the Col-
umbia protest apparently do not recognize this responsibility.
Is it right for 200 students in their pursuit of certain goals to
close down an institution whose population numbers 27,000?
Is it right for the minority, in its fervor, to destroy private
property and descrate personal belongings?

We believe that the tactics used by the Columbia Strike
Committee are ill-conceived and anarchistic. These tactics,
very definitely, are simply not the way to go about achieving
a group’s goals. ‘

The American system is one which explicitly provides
for the diliberation of ideas. It is through debate and verbal
conflict, that our best policies are discovered. By adhering
to the tactics of the Columbia Strike Steering Committee. the
concept of free speech and thought is negated. And we can’t
accept such a negation.

 

]udaism’s Dilemma

The Continuing Legacy of Purim

by HOBART HARRIS

This is a story about the Jews.
The Jewish Jews. Me. It's not a
whole lot of fun to write about.
but its been a long time coming
and needs to be said. The Jews
have been kicked out of almost
every country that they've ever
been in. Are there more on the
way? i »

I remember my earliest real
contact with Judiaism. It was
when I went to my first Seder.
It was really great. I got to ask
the Four Questions (I forgot one).
beat my cousins to the Matzoh
(my grandfather had hid it under
his chair). and complained about
the fact that us kids only got
grape juice. while the grown-ups
got wine (although God knows I
couldn't stand wine at that age.
and thought grape juice was just
great). Being Jewish was groovy.

Then when I was in second
grade I went off to Sunday school
prepared for the worst. armed
with a Mongle No. 2 pencil. a
Spiral notebook. and an abiding
hatred of little girls. What the
hell. I was seven years old. and
five days of school was more than
enough in any week.

But as it turned out, Sunday
School wasn’t all that bad. All
we had to do was read a couple
of chapters a week in something
called My Jewish Reader. which
turned out to really be interest-
ing. Rather than talking about a
lot of religious junk, it talked
about wars, pestilences and op-
pressions. It turned out that read-
ing about Jewish history was just
like reading the paper, except the
names were harder to pronounce.

It was really a fun time. Sun-
day School. You could read about
the Jews getting kicked out of
Egypt. Israel. Persia. Spain. or
England. You could read the story
of Esther and Mordecai. who
talked King Ashasuaras out of
stringing up the Jews on the next
gallows because Hamen said that
we were not paying our taxes. or
you could read about the secret
Morenos. Jews who lived in Spain
during the Inquisition who were
forced to hold their services un-
derground. Pretty soon I caught
on to the idea that Jews were the
persecuted people. the ones that
nobody liked and everybody was
trying either to hang. shoot. or
exile. I'd get to the next chapter

State of Gumball: It’s Perplexing

Editor. The Pitt News:

Over the weekend I took. as a
lark. a trip to the State of Mouth.
While there I observed a fantasy
too real to be believed. too fan-
tastic not to be believed. I relate
my obervations to you for what
they are worth. I observed a trag-

V edy so profound that good con-

science allows me to tell only
the lighter side. I call the hap-
penings in that State. The Case
of Gumball.

A gumball has a chewable.
sticky interior covered by a hard
shell produced by the Gum Sys-
tem for the purpose of achieving
the ultimate -— salivation. It sooths
the nerves and strengthens the
teeth to cope with any possible
invader of the Mouth. The State
of the Mouth is the all encom-
passing and everything is done
for it.

Friday evening. the night of my
arrival. D. Gumball had found
some non -gumballs scurrilously
questioning the health of the
Mouth. He was especially incens-
ed by the attack on the teeth area
where he believed the strength of
the Mouth to be. Not knowing
anything of the constitution of
the gum area. where the real fun-
damental strength of the Mouth
was. he set forth. in true sticky
gumball fashion. to rectify the
Mouth by attacking at the un-
mouthing activities of the non-
gumballs.

Denty. as he likes to be called.
in the fourth year of the reign of
John. son of Lindin. cryed out
the sacred word “un-mouthers“
and set forth to challenge the
non-gumballs who were resisting
the pulling out of the teeth. The
non-gumballs were resisting this
and the teeth replacement by
false ones because. as I was told.
the gums were decaying and only
resistance to the decay could save
the Mouth. Denty Gumball call-
ed for a mouthwashing by the
School of Un—Mouthing Activ-
ities.

But Denty Gumball could not
wait. he jumped into the foray.

Upon chewing Gumball. the

stickyvésubstance began spreading

teeth for not conforming to the
other teeth.

They began falling out being
replaced by false teeth approved
by Gumball as having the prop-
er strength to withstand the eye
teeth. At the time the saliva be-
gan building. the eye teeth were
in league with the constitution
of the gums. the history of the
Mouth. and the goals of keeping
the Mouth open to breath. for to
close it meant the nose would
take over with its sinus problems.
The saliva filling the Mouth in-
fected all, even the eye teeth;
The School of Un—Mouthing Ac-
tivities injected novacaine and
laughing gas. It makes good copy
as the Mouths newsmen gleeful-
ly told me when I interrupted
them from their ecstasies.

The tongue which was the ar-
britor of whether to swallow or
not to swallow did not try to pro-
tect the eye teeth from being
forced to go where they had no
right being — in the stomach to
be washed away for no purpose
for the stomach was a penisula
of emptiness and darkness with-
out meaning.

Denty finally restricted the
Mouth to suit his gumball taste.
The eye teeth became sharper
and more far ranging in their
hopes of changing the Mouth. But
the false teeth insured only the
gums would be the eye teeth al-
lies for the teeth being false did

in the book wondering what was
going to happen to us next.

At the time. I didn‘t make much
of it. That's just the way it is. I
thought. We Jews just had to
watch out. But looking back. I'm
beginning to wonder whether this
is the right way that I. or any
other Jewish child should be so-
cialized. We learned that other
people couldn't be trusted. that
we were always in danger. al-
ways threatened. We used to sing
“America the Beautiful“ a lot.
but I don't think that it was real-
ly in celebration of America. but
almost as a plea to non-Jews.
"Look at us." we‘d say. “we‘re
really not bad at all- We even
sing patriotic songs."

What this all is leading up to
is that the manner in which a
child is socialized has much to
do with the formation of his per-
sonality. Much work has been
done on the negative self-image
of the Negro. Its time to do the
same with the Jew. Stop and
think about it. Unravel the main
threads of what we were taught
to expect from the world. Ana-
lyze our expectations. our beliefs.
our values. Something is wrong.

To be Continued)

 

gums any longer. Thus. the eye
teeth revolted to prevent more no-
vocaine and laughing gas which
had become the antiseptic of the
State of the Mouth.

The outcome‘? Denty Gumball
became the Grand Babeller in the
reign of John. son of Lindin. The
eye teeth became ever sharper
and more cynical for Gumball
and the Mouth he was trying to
create did not have nor deserved
any respect.

The passing way of the State
of the Mouth this weekend leaves
me saddened. Once it was a great
state. In the end. it was no bet-
ter than the other Mouths. I came
away disheartened from the igni-
minous death of the state by
gumballs. The gumballs insured
the State of Mouth would never
be great let alone just in its ac-
tivities.

I have had to define my own
reality so I could tell you this
short horror story. Denty Gum-
ball was real. so real that I have
concluded he had to be fantasy
for he was able in the State to de-
fine what was not there.

Editor, The Pitt News:

_ Your coverage and editorial on former state representa-

First, I am afraid that any publicity you gave to his in-
temperate and perhaps politically motivated charges will
serve only to rescue him from the oblivion he so richly de-

Second. and of more importance, you have taken him to
task over the issue of opposing the draft.

The real issue is much more important and that is the

Reflections-5?

  

..._

By ROY JACOBS
In the locker room, following Sat-
in-‘day’s spring football game, most
of the Panthers on the defensive
units were hoopin’ and hollerin’—
and rightly so. They had just stop-
ped the offensive 32-13, in the mud.

But on the other side, the offense
wasn’t feeling too badly either.
They knew it wasn’t their type of
day, and the coaches, the defense,
and most everybody else agreed
that there wasn’t much the offense
could have done under the conditions
present Saturday afternoon.

There were scouts on hand too,
from West Virginia and Air Force,
so coach Dave Hart didn’t want to
give away too many secrets. As it
was, most of Mountaineer coach Jim
Carlen’s notes were about the Pan-
thers’ defenses. And it was the de-
fense that stole the show.

THE PANTHER running attack bogged gain by J. D. Lewis (303:-John Wozniak
(44), John Stevens (75), and Ed Sinesky
(42). Sprignoli gained 18 yards on five

 

carries.

The defense held the offense on
downs 11 times (11 points), recov-
ered three fumbles (9 points), and
intercepted four passes (12 points).
Defensive coach Dan Sekanovich,
who made his first spring at Pitt an
interesting one for all the Panthers,
said his squad did a good job, but
suggested that the players themselv-
es could discuss their performance
better than he could.

“We had a good day,” reviewed
linebacker Ed Gallin, co-captain a-
long with Ed Whitaker and Skip
Orszulak of the offense. “t was the
first time since I’ve been here that
when a starter got tired, we had

and wingback Joe McCain, who
caught a combined 11 passes for 107
yards. The first touchdown was scor-
ed by second-team wingback J. D.
Lewis late in the first half on a 13-
yard pass from sophomore Dave
Havern.

Havern was the starting quarter-
back, but he never could get un-
tracked from the mud. Before Sat-
urday, Havern had been the biggest
surprise of spring practice.

“It was a real shame that Dave
couldn’t show everybody ‘what he
can do,” remarked Hart. “How
many times did he go to cut and
shp?”

But as disappointed as Hart may
have been about the weather and
the crowd for the game Saturday,
the rain didn’t dampen any feelings
about the success of the entire
spring program.

Blue offense.

“We made progress in many re-
spects this Spring,” commented
Hart. “One, we got more work done.
Two, we had a green squad, and it
learned a lot. Three, because of the
good weather, our quarterbacks had
the best passing spring we’ve ever
had. And four, we learned to know
our personnel better. I think every-
body’s been pretty well placed. May-

be the weather was a blessing in

disguise.”

But for anybody who didn’t come
to any of the spring practices ex-
cept the final game, spring football
was a letdown. That group includes
most of the fans and many mem-
bers of the news media. These are
the people who will remain uncon-
vinced until the fall. But after all,
spring football is for the coaches
and the players; the fans’ proof is in
the winning.

By BILL NAAB
Despite mud and constant rain, coach Jim Banner’s
tracksters crushed Wayne State Saturday at Detroit, 84-61.

Banner believes that the entire team earned the victory. “They’re a

good bunch,” said Banner.

, Both Chuck Reisen and Chet
Wojiechowski were double win-
ners. Neither performance sur-
prised Banner. He described Rei
sen as a great competitor and
said Wojiiechowski did exception-
ally well in running the 100-yard
dash in :09.9 and the 220 in:23.4.

Reisen had entered four events.

He won the 120-yard high hur-'

dules and the 440 intermediate
hurdles and came in third in the

, triple jump. The coach also com-

qnirr womzcnowsm
Double Winner

mented that he did a real fine
job in the mile relay.

Jerry Richey scampered victor-
iously in the mile and finished
second in the half mile despite
slipping and slidding on the mud-
dy track. Banner didn’t even use
Bryant Salter because his legs
were bothering him in addition
to the poor prevailing conditions.

Jay Neyer and Wayne Boden-
heimer also impressed Banner.
Neyer dashed to second place fin-
ishes in the 220 and 440, while
Bodenheimer won in the javelin.
“Because of the bad conditions,
he threw only three times and
won,” remarked Banner. These
poor conditions at Detroit cost
Banner the services of a fine
performer, Bob McElhenny. Bob
placed second in the shotput, and
slipped in the high jump. He
wrenched a knee and may have
a broken ankle.

“His loss would hurt us. He
can do so many things,” cited
Banner. Before McElhenny incur-
red the injury, he was expected
to compete in at least five events.
The coach says he doesn't believe
he has anyone who can really
take McElhenny’s place.

The mud and rain also ham-
pered Wayne State. Banner stated
that the Detroiters have plenty
of good jumpers and knows that
the mud must have hurt them.

In the rough Quadrangular
Meet at Syracuse next week, Ban-
ner believes that his field events

and lack of depth could be his
big problems.

Mitters Top Buffalo, Orange,
Oppose Clarion State, Today

As of last week, the baseball
teams of Buffalo Univesity and
Syracuse University both had
hopes of receiving bids to the Na-
tional Collegiate Baseball Toum-
ament. But the Panther baseball-
ers beat Buffalo, 5-1, Friday, and
swept both ends of a doublehead-
er at Syracuse, 12-8 and 10-9-

“We played the role of spoil-
ers this past weekend,” explained
baseball coach Bobby Lewis.
“Buffalo had a 14-3 record and
they had an outside chance of
getting a bid to the Tournament
if they kept winning. And Syra-
cuse also thought they had a
chance to get a bid with their
15-5 record. But the two losses
probably ‘killed their chances.”

The “spoilers” finaly played
the brand of baseball that was
predicted of them before the sea-
son started; a bid to the Tourna-
ment was also a pre-season goal
of the mitters.

“We played great baseball
against Buffalo Friday,” said
Lewis happily. “We only made
one error and George Medich
pitched real well.” ’

Medich, who has had his prob-
lems alternating as a tight- end
and a pitcher, surprised Lewis.

“Medich looked like the pitch-

‘er he was on the Coast,” said

Lewis, referring to the 18 score-
less innings the footballer flung
in the California Tournament.
“He’s been wild lately because
football practices has prevented
him from practicing his pitching.
But Medich had real good control
against Buffalo.”

In the doubleheader sweep at
Syracuse, the mitters pleased
Lewis with the amount of hit-
ting that he has expected of them.

“We hit real well,” said Lew-
is. “It was a wild doubleheader,
Syracuse scored 17 runs and still
lost both games.”

In the first game at least one
run was scored in every inning,
but the Panthers scored four
runs in the first frame and never
behind. But the second game was
wilder.

With two out in the bottom half
of the sixth inning, shortstop
Rick Cassata, who quarterbacks
the Orange football team, tried
to score from second base on a
base-hit was thrown out at the
plate. Cassata barreled into
catcher Sammy Glass, but Glass
held on to the ball, and the mit-

ters went on to win the game
in the eighth inning of the sev-
en-inning g a m e. Centerfielder
George McKenzie provided the
winning blow with a blast that
landed at the base of the center-
field fence, approximately 500
feet away.

The baseball team is slated to
play Clarion today and Allegheny
Thursday afternoon. Lewis is
confident of two more wins..

“I’m the hitting coach, and the
hitting has been fine lately,” ex-
plained Lewis, “but our pitching
coach Dean Billick hasn’t been

coach Willie Myers has been too
busy with football practice. But
the good showing against Buffalo
and Syracuse should help our
confidence for the remainedr of
the schedule.”

 

 

Netters Meet Unbeaten
CMU in Grudge Match;
Split Pair in New York

The tennis team faces Carnegie—Mellon today in the tra-
ditional grudge battle between cross-city rivals. But today’s

match has an added attraction.

CMU has won nine straight matches this season and expects to

record the first undefeated season
in its net history. Coach Ben
Pope’s boys, however, would like
nothing better than to spoil those
plans.

“Carnegie has a very good
team,” explained Coach Pope,”
but J. D. Lewis will be playing
for us today and he should be
a big help.” Lewis has been di-
viding his time between football
and tennis this spring and Lewis
has seen limited action for the
netters. In his only match of the
season however, he won a de-
cisive victory.

The netters split a p air of
matches over the weekend in
New York, shuttingout Buffalo
9-0 Friday before faling to Syra-
cuse 6-3 the folowing afternoon.

“The boys played well in both
matches,”‘ added the coach, “but
Syracuse was a little too strong,
and, of course, they had the home
court advantage.”

Tom Stromp and captain Bob
Salembier accounted for all of
the netters’ scoring at Syracuse.
Stromp defeated Larry Garinger
63, 6-2 while Salembrier downed
Jeff Shankman 4-6, 6-0, 6-1. In
doubles, they teamed up to de-
feat Garinger and Ken Ritzen-
berg 6-3, 61.

“Stromp’s win in singles was
a good one,’commented Pope.
“His opponent, Garinger, was
Syracuse’s most valuable player
in l966.”

Bill Nichols and Elliot Sainer
both dropped close matches at
Syracuse. Nichols lost his first
set to Ritzenberg 7-5, but rallied
to take the second easily 6-1.
In the deciding set, Nichols was
outsteadied and lost 6-2.

Sainer won his first set from

the coach.

Four Away Matches

Golfers Prepare For ‘Busiest Week’

Four matches on the road,
beginning today at Clarion
present Rex Perry’s golf
team With their busiest week
of the spring. It, could not
have come at a Worse time.

The squad has just returned
from a trip to Princeton, one that
they would like to forget. Not
a single one of them made the
final cut in the Eastern Intercol-
legiate Golf Association Tourney.

Bill Bryan came closest, shoot-

Harvard won the team title,
edging Princeton by ten points
and Penn State, the defending
champ, by 11. Bob Porter of
Princeton took the indiv.idual hon-
ors.

Peery thought that a rain storm
that occurred during the second
round, and some very long par
four holes hurt his team, but
he does not place all the blame
here. He said, “We were no good
when the weather was good.”

However, at least one of the
golfers has not given up. Mike

McGuire claims, “I think next 5

year will be better.” ' I

Next year is not the problem
at the moment. There is a rugged

week ahead. After today’s match I

the team must travel to the In-
diana Invitational Tourney to-g
morrow and then visit Duquesne
and Allegheny on Thursday and
Friday, respectively.

 

ing a two-round score of 161.
Mike McGuire fired a 162 in the
rounds where a 158 was needed
to survive the out.

“It was bad. I figured they’d
be better . . . not a one,” mut-
tered Peery.

Rick Golden, team captain, add-
ed that his team finished next
to last in the final standings.

“The way it was raining, the
we‘; we played, we were gald
to get away,” Perry said. “But,
we did beat Syracuse.”

VIETNAM TRIANGLE:

Moscow, Peking, Hanoi
Donald S. Zagoria

Improving prospects for a negotiated settlement of the Vietnam war
make all the more urgent a clariﬁcation of the relationships of the
different Communist factions involved. Vietnam Triangle is perhaps the
most thoroughly informed and documented analysis available on this
complex matter. ”A plea for understanding that there are a variety of
plausible options open for peace in Vietnam. Few American experts are
more qualified to examine the alternatives to present United States
policy in Vietnam than Donald Zagoria, new Director of the Modern
Asia Research Institute at Hunter College, and author of The Sina-
Soviet Canﬂict, a classic on the crack-up of the Communist camp.”

THE POLITICS OF POVERTY

John C. Donovan

”What ever happened to the War on Poverty? John C. Donovan's
analysis of the conception, evaluation and eventual enfeeblement of
Lyndon Iohnson’s offensive leads one to believe that nothing is likely
to revive it. Chairman of the Department gf Government at Bowdoin
College and a‘ former New Frontiersman, Donovan served as an aide to
Labor Secretary Willard Wirtz from 1962-65 . . . he communicates
something of the sense of urgency and desperation that was shared by
so many of the anti-poverty workers who enlisted for what they thought
might be a glorious fight.” —-The New Leader
”Highly recommended. The ﬂames of Detroit have shown dramatically
how vital it is for us to understand why the Negro poor are angry. Mr.
Donovan's book is one that will help us achieve that understanding.”

YEARS OF PROTEST “‘
A Collection of American Writings of the 1930's

Edited by Jack Salzman with Barry Wallenstein

The excitement, the anger and the anguish of the Depression Era, its
issues, struggles and movements, are magnificently evoked in this
illustrated anthology of stories, songs, poems, plays and reviews by
leading writers of the period, among them Agee, Algren, Anderson,
Benet, Caldwell, Cowley, Cummings, Dos Passos, Farrell, Gold, Hayes,
Hemingway, MacLeish, Maltz, Millay, Miller, Odets, Pound, Saroyan,
Stevens, Steinbeck, Wolfe, Wright, Vorse, West, and others. With
photos, cartoons, paintings, and drawings of the period. ”A collector's

item . . . required reading for anyone studying that period of our
history." —The Chicago Tribune
”l.IsefuI and faithful . . . the heart of this literature lies in its protest

—against the men and institutions that made a national disaster out of
greed, inertia, and mendacity.” —The Nation

THE WAR MYTH
Donald A. Wells

”An incisive attack upon modem war-making, an attack aimed not so
much against the methods as the attitudes of the war-makers.”
—The Los Angeles Times
”Equally at home with Dr. Strangelove and St. Thomas Aquinas, Wells
quotes pertinently to prove.his point that war must be made illegal if
the human race is to survive. Perhaps the most appalling part of this
history of 2,500 years of war is the demonstration that Christian leaders,
throughout the ages, have apologized for and defended their nations’
right to wage war."
-—Prof. Ralph Spitzer, University of British Columbia
"To my knowledge, the best book on the subject, especially valuable
because of the extensive and thorough documentation.”
—Prof. Herbert Marcuse, University of California at San Diego

Rockefeller Policies Clarified

Since Nelson Rockefeller enter-
ed the presidenial primary race
at a rather late date, many of
his policies are not well known.
The following points should help
to clarify the Governor's posi-
tion.

Concerning the Vietnam and
Asian situation;

>China, the Soviet Union,
North Vietnam, and all of the
Asian countries must be consult-
ed to provide lasting peace in
Vietnam.

Tb “India should be a stabiliz-
ing factor in Asia . . . We have
not done enough to help stabil-
ize India.”

> Hypothetically, opening com-
munications with China should
immediately change present cir-
cumstances.
> Escalation is not the right
answer. So far, the Soviet Union,
China, and North Vietnam “have
been able to match us right up
to the ultimate.”
>“We 'don‘t have absolute
power, and you can’t talk in
terms of total military victory in
Vietnam.
At home: -
>Rockefeller has talked to
Harlem super militant Charles
Kenyatta, leader of Harlem Mau
Mau group to solved area prob-

lems. This led to an investiga-
tion into narcotics traffic and
police corruption in New York
City.

5 “You can’t have order with-
out progress.” (Nixon has been
quoted as saying, “You can’t
have progress without order.”)

>Before entering politics, he
proved himself successful in bus-
iness. He turned “Rockefeller’s
Folly” (Rockefeller Center) into
a financial success and a central
drawing point in the city.

Politically;
»> He’s entering a race with-
out the full backing of his party,
