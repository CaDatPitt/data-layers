the 'Burgh

  unbeatable,

says   poll r

by Jamar Thrasher
Staﬁ’ Writerr

The clear skies hanging
over Pittsburgh in recent days
are, a new poll said, not so
clear after all. ‘

Pittsburgh has secured its
spot as the No. 1 city in the
“Top 10 U.S. Cities Most Pol-
luted by Short-Term Particle
Pollution, ” a poll adminis-
tered by the American Lung
Association.

The declaration of Pitts-
burgh as the country’s premier
in air pollution comes less than

one year after Places Rated‘

Almanac named it “America’s
Most Livable City.”

This title can be attributed
to surrounding areas of Pitts-
burgh, not particularly to the
city itself, said Allegheny
County Health Department
spokesman Guillermo Cole".

“The fact of -the matteris
that the ranking only applies
accurately to the Liberty-
Clairton area, and Pittsburgh,
the rest of the county and the
surrounding‘ counties
much better air,” said Cole in a
recent interview with the Pitts-
burgh.Post—Gazette.

According to Cole, the as-
sessment of area of the Ameri-
can Lung Association has
been misguided, and attention
should be turned .toward U.S.
Steel’s Clairtoin ‘Coke Works
plant, which deposits» soot in
the Monongahela River Val-
ley. A - _

surrounding areas are not _on
any future lists and to improve

feel comfortable. She was con-
stantly using accents and making-
jokes.”

Besides languages, Meghan
also loved to travel and experience
diﬁerent cultures, said her mother,
Brenda Eppley.

“She embraced the idea of
diversity and loved meeting in-
dividuals from every culture and
ethnic background,” she said. “It
was only natural for her to pursue
international travel. She had been
to Egypt, England and the Caribbe-
an and spent six weeks last summer
living with a family in Turkey.”

When Meghan was in fourth
grade, she moved from Carlisle
to Camp Hill and lived there with

"her mother and stepfather, said

Anna West, one of Meghan’s best
friends. on weekends, she visited
her father and stepmother in Bal-
timore, Md. Freas was also very
close with her stepbrother and half-
sister.

In high school, West recalled
how Meghan helped to plan all of
the school’s spirit activities, includ-
ing homecoming, as a member of
the Pep Club. She also participated
in Quiz Bowl and theater. A

“She was just an all—around
great person who loved life,” said
West “She was the very deﬁnition
of joie de vivre.”

Clare Ferrari, Meghan’s best
friend since sixth grade, said that

Meghan’s fun-

' loving, ﬁiendly personality espe-

cially stood out to Jones when they
attended a Christmas party together
in Pittsburgh last December. Even
though Meghan, did not know
many people there, Jones said she
instantly made friends and con-

‘ nected with nearly everyone in the

room.
“She was a remarkably loyal
person to her friends, and she was
so caring even about people that
she’ didn’t know very well,” said
Jones. ' *
Even though she transferred to

that Meghan always
cherished her close

. “Meghan was .
the best person to go to when you _

were having a rough day,” she
said. “She would just randomly

say something to make you smile. I

will miss the random text messages
that I used to get from her.” «

Meghan was the master of catch

_ phrases. She remembered how she

would say expressions like ‘These
are my words; use your words!”
and “Hey, I know you!” to her
ﬁiends. A t 4

“I swear every, week she would
have a new thing to say,” said
Kearnmerer.

Like many young ‘ people,
Meghan’s Facebook proﬁle dis-
plays her collage of interests. Some
of her favorite bands included The

Doors, Pink Floyd, The Velvet Un- t

derground, Jelferson Airplane and
The Guess Who. \ I‘ _ ‘

“Meghan loved all music," said
Keammere_r. “When we would
work together in the box ofﬁce, we
would listen to anything from tech-
no, Feist, rap and Celtic music.”

Meghan’s love for music was
even apparent when West used
to drive Meghan to school during
their junior and senior years of high
school. West recalled how Meghan
would scold her for not listening to
good radio stations in the car. '

“96.1 was her favorite,” she
said. “It was an oldies station; She
loved old music, especially Ella
Fitzgerald.” _

In addition to music, Meghan
enjoyed reading the Harry Pot-
ter series and went with West to
Barnes and Noble for the midnight
release of the sixth book

“We both ﬁnished it within 24
hours,” said West. “Then we went
back to the same Barnes and Noble

_ and dissected the book chapter by

chapter. It was the nerdiest, most
awesome thing that I have ever
done.” _
Meghan never ﬁnished the
seventh Harry Potter book since it

that she was in the process of read-
ing each chapter out loud to her at
night.

Although Meghan Freas want-
ed, to learn more languages and
dreamed about traveling to other
places during her lifetime, she
wrote on her Facebookproﬁle that
“the simpler things in life go unap-
preciated by most people.”

“I don’t think I enjoy anything
in life more than laughing and
laughter,” she wrote. “Life’s not
worth living without it.”

i “I will always remember her ﬁ-

her deﬁning physical characteris-
tic. And her smile and laugh. She
had the best teeth thatl have ever

Eppley said her daughter taught

. her forgiveness and unconditional

love.

“She didn’t hold grudges and
preferred to see the positive side in
every-situation,” she said.

V To Ferrari, Meghan’s sparkling
personality and sky-lighting smile
allowed her to become a part of ev-
eryone who surrounded her.

. “I feel so privileged for ev-
ery second that I had the honor‘ of

knowing that gir ,” she said. “She _
will always be my best friend, the _

one who knows everything about
me. She was the most trustworthy

$1 billion upgrade. The upgrade will
include for the first new battery of coke
ovens. This could be issued as early as
the end of June.

“Our projection is that the Liberty-
Clairton area will come into attain-
ment for airborne particles by 2015,”
said Cole, “while the rest of the region,
where particulate levels are much low-
er, will come into attainment by 2010.
We have a plan in place, and the new
coke batteries and pollution controls
will improve the air dramatically.”

Much to the chagrin of the Allegh-
eny Health Department, Kevin Stewart,
director of environmental health for the
American Lung Association of Penn-
sylvania, said there still is much more
work to be done in the area to decrease
air pollution.

“I respect the Allegheny County
Health Department, and the lung asso-
ciation supports what the health depart-
ment and U.S. Steel are doing to clean
up the place,” said Stewart.

“But the importance of the report is
to get the word out to the general public
about these serious pollution issues.”

According to a joint report issued by
The Group Against Smog and Pollution
and Clean Water Action, the region’s
problem is more devastating than ex-
pected.

The report estimates that more than
10 million Pennsylvanians — five out
of every six statewide — live in smog-

with Wikipedia

Professors use the online

encyclopedia as educational tool I

Even though professors

 might not like it or let students
i use it, Wikipedia is making
, a comeback in some univer-
j sity classrooms — but not as a
 source. Instead, some profes-

sors are having their students

; write articles for the popular
j encyclopedia Web site as a re-

placement for term papers or

I other traditional assignments.

An article from Agence
France-Presse said that teachers
in the University -of British Co-
lumbia in Vancouver, Canada,
have started requiring their stu-
dents to write well—researched
articles as graded assignments

; in their courses.

Overall, this seems like an

l excellent program. Wikipedia,

whether professors like it or

. not, has become one of the larg-
 est repositories of knowledge

in the world, with more than 10
million articles in 253 languag-
es hosted on the site. Unfortu-
nately, it also has a reputation as

 an inaccurate and academically

unsuitable means for acquir-
ing information, especially as
a source for papers and other
projects.

Programs like the one at
UBC could help to change that
paradigm and make the site a
resource not only for research

; but also for encouraging stu-
 dents to contribute to the aggre-
 gate knowledge of the Internet-

based community.
Studies conducted by the

; science journal “Nature” found

I Wikipedia to be about as ac-

3 curate as the Encyclopedia
 Britannica on most issues, and
j the site’s creators have said that
 Wikipedia has always strived
 for greater accuracy. Programs
3 such as the one at the UBC
 could help Wikipedia reach
 these goals.

That does not mean that

i Wikipedia is,’or ever will be,

an acceptable academic source.
Most professors bar traditional
encyclopedias from research re-

ports as well, and tales of large- '

scale errors on Wikipedia pages

have sparked controversy in the T

past.

There are also some pissuesf

with the content itself: When a 
student writes a paper, she writes 
it entirely by herself. Wikipedia 
offers the possibility of group?
writing, as well as the fact that 

errors or erroneous information

could be added to the page over
time, things that could not hap-
pen with a traditional paper.

Given the rates of vandalism 
and the fact that many contro— 
versial pages on Wikipedia are 5
often restricted to administra—j
tors only, it could be that this 
type of assignment is not right 

problems with controversy.
Additionally, some students

a for issues that mightrun into;

have had their work deleted by 
Wikipedia’s administrators be-l
cause their articles do not meet 
with the site’s notability guide— 

lines, something that could be
a problem if a student chooses
to write about a topic that might
not be covered extensively in
the media or isn’t as well known
as other issues.

Despite the problems, these
assignments seem to be right in

principle. Wikipedia has already 
proven itself to be a valuable re-

Did you hear? Gas prices could
hit $4 per gallon this summer, ac— ,
cording to the U.S. Department
of Energy. Add in the swelter-
ing summer heat and Americans’
inexplicable love for enormous
gas—guzzling vehicles, and we’re
looking at one unhappy nation.

In other news, the government
is trying to solve this problem in
the most inefﬁcient way possible.
Again.

Keeping in tradition (another
thing we love in America) with
our long history of concessions,
special exceptions and bad deci-
sions when it comes to "getting oil,
the government is attempting -
yet again — to. soothe relations
with the crazy and ethically ques-

member here> instead of invest-
ing money in alternative energy
sources and attempting to ﬁnally
make a clean break from our de-
pendence on oil—producing coun-
tries.

This month’s lucky OPEC
member of choice is everyone’s
favorite South American dictator:
Hugo Chavez. ,

“Elected” as president of Ven-

 ezuela in 1998, Chavez is a 54-

‘ year-old ﬁrecracker and two-tirne

winner of Time Magazine’s 100
most inﬂuential people. He has

been accused of multiple counts,

of election fraud in his own coun-
try and others, using his power
and oil money to seat political al-
lies in the neighboring countries
of Ecuador, Bolivia and Nicara-
gua and is often likened to Louis
XIV of France (ouch).

Chavez also allegedly once
referred to President George W.
Bush as “the devil.”

Despite these claims, the U.S. .

government has played nice with
Chavez, offering up the lack of
hard evidence in proving any of
the above allegations as an excuse
to’ continue importing approxi-
mately 12, percent of our oil from

’ Chavez’s sticky ﬁngers, making

Venezuela our third largest source
of petroleum.

But last week, ironically amid
a bout of record—breaking gas
prices, The Wall Street Journal
reported that U.S. ofﬁcials have
authenticated" a collection of comi’
puter ﬁles “closely tying Ven-
ezuela’s President Hugo Chavez
to communist rebels seeking to
topple Colombia’s governmentf’

Ladies and gentlemen, I give
you hard evidence.

This puts the United States in
an extremely delicate position.

The documents report that Chavez
offered to arm the guerillas with
rocket-propelled grenades and
ground-to-air missiles, which in

' the classic deﬁnition of the term,

makes the Venezuelan V govem—
ment a state sponsor of terrorism.
Normally, as in the case of
Cuba and North Korea, this would
call for U.S. sanctions against the
country and a ban on its exports.
But an embargo on Venezu-
elan oil might hurt the United
States as much or more than it

hurts Chavez, especially with gas.

prices already climbing to new
and ridiculously high rates. It
could effectively throw the U.S.
economy into chaos, and it goes
without saying that the American
people won’t be happy when they

have to pay $5—plus for a gallon of"

gas. Not happy at all.

Forget about Columbia, the
U.S. government will have to
worry about a revolt within its
own borders (most likely led by
angry Nascar dads), instead.

Yet taking no action against
the Venezuelan government
makes us hypocrites. To punish
one country foraiding terrorists
and not another only weakens our
international position (not that the
restof the world currently views
us as the beacon of fairness and
justice that we purport ourselves

Candidates lacking clear energy policies

by  Camardat

Colummldt

Recently, I sat watching an ep-
isode of the ﬁrst season of HBO’s
“The Sopranos.” I noticed that in
the introduction, ﬁlmed around
1999, there was a quick shot of
a gasoline station sign. Realizing

that today’s price per barrel of oil

is upward of $120, I decided to
pause the DVD to see just how
far the price per gallon of gas has
risen in‘ less than a decade. When
I saw it was $0.98 a ‘gallon, all I
could do was laugh.

Of late, reports of global
warming and the effects of cli-
mate change have dominated the
debate about energy policy. While
these are extremely important is-
sues that need to be addressed,
the United States is facing a more
immediate crisis: peak oil. Re-
ports of peak oil, when maximum
global oil production is reached,
have been around since 1956,
when geologist M. King Hubbert
completed his research detail-
ing the dwindling supply of oil.
Speculation that we’re at peak

oil is a major reason why today’s'
price per barrel is beyond $120.
Assuming this speculation is

accurate, and the global supply _

of oil is running low, the United

_ States is facing a crisis. Being in

the middle of a heated presiden-
tial primary, one would expect
vast and immediate solutions to
what President George W. Bush
in 2006 called the United States’
“addiction to oil.”

Yet in this 2008 primary sea-
son, energy policy has taken a
backseat to issues like the econ-
omy and the War in Iraq. Hillary
Clinton and Barack Obama have
energy policies that focus on re-
ducing oil importation 20 to 30
years from now. Both support
further investment in ethanol and
biodiesel. A recent analysis done
by Cornell arid the University of
California at Berkeley concluded
that ethanol and biodiesel do not
provide the same amount of ener-
gy as is needed for their produc-
tion. McCain joins their support
of ethanol and biodiesel,‘ stating
in a 2007 speech that they are
“promising and available altema—
tives to 0' .”

In order to ﬁnd out about the

_ candidates’ respective plans, one

has to go to their Web sites. Their
stump speeches and television
commercials talk more about
creating jobs and lowering gas
prices than they do about devel-
oping a lasting energy resource.
On the Web sites, they offer sum-
maries of their plans littered with
expansive statements that are

lofty and unlikely to pass through .

Congress.

For instance, on Clinton’s Web
site, she promises “a plan to cata-
lyze athriving green building in-
dustry by investing in green col-
lar jobs and helping to modernize
and retroﬁt 20 million low-in-
come homes to makethem more
energy efﬁcient” along with other
promises to increase fuel efﬁcien-
cy and building federal buildings
that are zero emission. But with
relation to alternatives for oﬂ,
there is little to be found other
than plans to invest in alternative
fuel research. Obama makes sirn—
ilar promises, outlining ambitious
plans to reduce carbon emissions,
invest in green technologies and
provide incentives to purchase

about the need to improve fuel

massive, national effort to create
alternative power sources. Solar
power, hydro—electric generation,
geothermal programs and nuclear
power are all currently possible.
Nuclear power is perhaps the
most realistic solution because of
the available technology.
McCain and Obarna touch on
nuclear power brieﬂy, but neither
embraces it as a solution. Clin-

dangerous. That thought process
is outdated, as shown by a 2007
Nuclear, Energy Institute report
that states that 79 percent of
Americans believe it is “appro-
priate for the federal government
to provide some ﬁnancial assis-
tance to jurnpstart nuclear, solar,
wind and other carbon-free en-
ergy technologies.” Furthermore,
the World Nuclear Association
has reported that countries like
France rely on nuclear power for
75 percent of their energy. The
longer the United States waits
to invest in nuclear energy, the
less competitive it will become
economically because of the high
price of oil. Instead of nuclear
power being a hallmark of an
energy program, it’s cast aside in
favor of ethanol and other lack-
luster programs.

We should demand from our
candidates a comprehensive, re-
alistic energy plan before it’s too

late. We need to have foresight ’

and plan for the inevitable life
without oil.

Nestled in Downtown Pitts-
burgh, SPACE stands out among
the buildings around it. Since its
exterior is made almost entirely
out of glass, people can peer in
and see some of the art gallery’s
latest showings. Its newest exhi-
bition, Pittsburgh Now, encom-
passes every wall of the one—room
venue, and the artists behind it
have utilized everything from pa-
per to marble for their showcased
works.

Murray Horne, Pittsburgh
Now’s curator, has been a curator
for the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust
for 12 years and has been involved
with SPACE since its opening in
2003.

Home said that SPACE differs

from the other galleries he works
with, 707 Penn and Wood Street
galleries, because of its content
and its size.

' “SPACE traditionally hosts
group shows by local and national
artists,” he said. “Penn shows 10-
cal art work like SPACE but is
much smaller and usually has solo
shows.”

Currently within SPACE, one
wall is covered in black swirls
and shapes that resemble ma-
chines or monsters of some kind,
but this scene is only the back-
drop for small, framed paintings.
Each painting is ﬁlled with black
paint and ink, making scenes of
abstract human bodies while the
addition of random drops of color
counteract these dark characters.

The guys in that cage don’t just go

Using a more varied range of

with accompanying stories and
meanings. One of Rostek’s works,
a dark painting with a small yel-

translation of William B1ake’s
poem, “The Tyger.” Another one
of his paintings, involving a black
background covered with strips of
white marble, resembles a lonely
game board or maze, the single
spot of color being the only player
in the game.

can compete under deadline and
muster creativity and a high
level of production in the team
setting.

Pittsburgh is one of 65 cities
the 48 Hour Film Project will
tour nationally in addition to its
12 international stops.

Teams are given only 48
hours to try to create the best
overall four— to seven—minute

A meet-and-greet at Cefalo’s
Restaurant and Night Club aims
to collect more‘ 48 Hour Film
participants at 7 p.m. Wednes-

Individuals can go to the
restaurant in Carnegie to hear
a guest speaker, participate in
a question—and—answer session
for an hour and then be part of
a casting call for producers and
actors. Actors should bring cop-
ies of their bios and headshots.
Teams only partially assembled
should add clout to their team,
and those looking to get involved
should audition for a team.

The kickoff will take place
back at Cefalo’s on Friday, June
6 at 5 p.m. Teams will blindly
pick a character, a prop, a line of
dialog and a genre before 7 p.m.,
when they are cut loose for two

Paranormal Activity:

 Read all aboutit

by Anton Skerl ,
Staff Wrtter

A look back at historyreveals
intense wars and ﬁghts that would
make “Saving Private Ryan” look
like an episode of “Teletubbies.”
Nearly every minute of every day
in history, people have been at war.

‘But according to Christopher
Carter and his book, “Parapsychol-
ogy and the Skeptics,” no war has
contained more tum—arounds, sur-
prises, victories and defeats than
the struggle to legitimize the study
of the paranormal.

“The book deals with the l1istor-
ical and experimental evidence for
psychic phenomena, the arguments
that attempt to debunk the subject,
the scientiﬁc and philosophical is-
sues and the dark history of the so-
called skeptical movement,” said
Carter.

“While a, student in Oxford, I

lived in an old farmhouse that was .
_ said to be haunted. The strange ex-

periences we had there sparked my

interest, and I beganreading books i

in the ﬁeld.”

From there, his curiosity in
things that go bump in the night has
butted heads against skeptics who
refuse to believe in otherworldly
phenomena such as ghosts, elec-
tronic voice phenomenon and psy-

_ chic powers. '

“The dogmatic skeptics have

. gone to the most extraordinary

lengths to deny, distort and sup-
press the evidence, merely because
the evidence "

doesn’t believe in going blindly
into a ﬁght with both barrels blaz-
ing gunpowder and little else. His
artillery consists of data painstak-
ingly collected over the years, turn-

ing his argument into a 21st-centu- .

ry‘ ordinance that would make the

- unprepared opposing troops quake

in their boots.‘ '

“An argument with a dogmatic
skeptic made me realize the weak-
ness of their position,” said _Carter,
“so I decided a book was needed to
challenge -these biased and preju-
diced opinions.” .

Parapsychology has been ac-
cepted into the American Associa-
tion fortheAdvancement of Science
since 1969 and has been studied by
the government. Some universities
even offer parapsychology courses
and majors, with Carter’s book as

. supplemental material. .
But Carter believes that one rea- A
son that parapsychology will con- V

tinue to attract attention, whether
for or against its study, is because
of its popularity. People continue to

' be intrigued by what they don’t un-

derstand, even if they don’t believe
it.
' Thanks .to ﬁlms like‘ “The
Sixth Sense,” Carter believes that
parapsychology will continue to
ignite interest for quite some time.
“I enjoyed ‘The Sixth Sense.’ I
thought the writers did their home-

work before writing the story. I‘

think ﬁlms like that ‘are popular

with psychic phenomena.”_y

block of programming will attest

almost-‘surrealist sense of humor.

an. evolution of “Tom.”
Both shows revolve aroundthe

experiences of two characters in a.

near-depressing rural setting, which
is the source of both shows’ humor.
Everything in both shows is entire-
ly run-down ‘and low—quality, from
Tom’s‘pathetic attempts at chang-
ing his town in “Tom” to any of the
numerous setting sketches in “Awe-
some Show” (“Gravy Robbers” -
a series of sketches about a restau-
rant where the food is so terrible it
needs to be drowned in gravy, and"
yet workers try to steal this essential
gravy as customers eat — immedi-
ately comes to mind). .

This rural-pathos theme is only

.. emphasized by, the appearance of

both shows. “Tom” was‘ barely
animated and always looked like
raw, uncolored drawings, while
“Awesome Show” looks as if it is
shot on a hand camera and is highly

  

reminiscent of late—night infomer-
cials and local commercial spots
(the special effects in some skits
are particularly faughable). But this
is all clearly intentional - there
are moments in both shows where
they break out of the rural—pathos
and have legitimately impressive
scenes. -

However, all this purpose-",

ﬁil manipulation of appearance
and subject matter plays into Tim
and .Eric’s comedic strengths. The
duo is at its best when they repre-
sent the people that populate the

mercial advertising some terrible
restaurant is funny — it’s because
of what the existence of these im-
plies about the people behind them.

Tom in “Tom” is especially
good at this -— he’s just a normal

"guy trying to improve his town

but is constantly thwarted by a de-
ranged mayor and the ridiculous
citizenry of said town. “Awesome
Show?’ has many characters like
this, including Casey Tatum, a hid-
eously sun—bumt singer on the late-
night telethon musical act “Uncle
Muscle’s Hour.” Casey is perhaps
the only character who has "a story
are, as he becomesincreasingly in-
effective in his performances and
eventually runs" away. Casey is so
awkward and pathetic that it’s prac-
tically impossible not to laugh and
reer terribleiabout it at the same time.

Where“Awesome Show” really
distinguishes itself from “T‘om” is in

its format. Unlike “T'orn,” which had

The Pitt softball team’s latest
foray into the Big East‘Champion-
ships was an epic battle, featuring
outstanding pitching, shoddy de-
fense and extra—inning dramatics.

But it also ended in severe heart- -

ache. .
The Panthers scored three runs in

the ﬁrst inning against DePaul in the

quarterﬁnals of the Big East Charn—

pionships Thursday but didn’t score '

again as the Blue Demons moved
on with a garne—winning single in
the 11th inning, 4-3.

Despite the defeat,'Pitt (31-25)
soaked in the success of one of the

best seasons in the program’s his- ,

tory.

The Panthers ﬁnished the season
with 31 wins, their second 30-win
campaign in the past three years.
They also captured 12 Big East vic-
tories, the most in schoolhistory for
one season. _ ' '

Coach Michelle Phalen was
proud of her club’s effort through-
out the year. _ _

“We had a pretty good season’? A

said Phalen. “We fought through
some adversity early on and came
out a stronger and more disciplined
team in the end. I thought the se-
niors really pushed the team and

p kept us together and focused on go-
ing in the right direction.”

Still, Pitt is left to wonder what
could have been after the loss to
DePaul. -

The Panthers offense mustered
only four hits, two apiece by seniors
Jessica Dignon and Mary Hecker.
Two of those hits came in the three-

.“Honestly, we needed a few
more hits,” said Phalen. “Offen-
sively, we were quiet from the ﬁfth
or sixth inning on. We started to
press at the plate and chased pitches
out of the zone that really helped
their pitcher.”

Pitt hung with the nationally
ranked Blue Demons thanks to
strong pitching. performances from
three diiferent hurlers.

As of Monday night, the
Pittsburgh Penguins hold a 2-0
lead in their Eastern Conference
Final series against the Philadel-
phia Flyers.

This, however, is nothing
new for this young team, as they
have had that same lead in each
of the previous two series.

While Sunday’s game might
not have been the team’s best
effort, as some of the players
themselves have said, it still
found a way to pull out a win.

That’s what separates a good
team from a great team. The
Penguins, despite a lackluster
effort in the ﬁrst two periods,
were able to capitalize when
they needed to.

The Flyers are a good team,
and we saw their best perfor-

mance in game two. It just,

wasn’t good enough.

Although the Penguins got
goals from Sidney Crosby and
Marian Hossa in game two, they
twice gave up two—goal leads

and gave life back to a dorni—

nated Flyers team.

Maxime Talbot, an often—un-
derrated player, was able to beat
Martin Biron at the 8:31 mark of
the third period to break a 2-2 tie
on Sunday. It was his ﬁrst game
back since suffering an ankle
injury that forced him to miss
three games.

It’s all about your chances.

With game two complete, the

series shifted back to Philadel-

phia last night, where the Pen-

guins hoped their hot streak in: _
the playoffs would _continu_e,?

Talbot knows this. In a Pitts-

bot stressed that “the Wachovia

son doesn’t mean anything.

The Penguins will have to
visit‘ the City of Brotherly Love
at least twice in this series, in-
cluding last night with a possible
game six in Philadelphia.

As game two ﬁnally ‘heated
up, the series saw its ﬁrst ﬁght,
between middle-weights Tyler
Kennedy and Scottie Upshall.
Look for the rest of these games
to get even more physical —
from both teams.

) They might not be “The I
‘ Broad Street Bullies” from the

1970s, but these Philadelphia
Flyers are still a physical team

,-that isn’t afraid to throw in a
“cheap shot. Mike Knuble took an

undisciplined crosscheck in the
ﬁrst period of game two, which

allowed for Sidney Crosby to \

capitalize on the power play.
Don’t discount the Penguins’
physicality, though. They have
the best ﬁghter in the league in
Georges Laraque if and menacing
players, like J arkko Ruutu, who
aren’t afraidto get into the face
of the opponent. The key for the
Penguins is to stay focused and

A disciplined. ‘ '

But if they do cross the line,

the penalty-killing unit has been
something of a strong point for
the Penguins. Not including
game three, Pittsburgh holds
the best penalty kill percentage
of any of the remaining playoff
teams at 88.6 percent.

Penguins Notes

-With an announced atten-
dance of 17,132 in game two,
the Penguins sold out their 63rd
straight home game, an ongoing
franchise record.

-Pending last night’s game,
the Penguins hold the best re-
cord in the playoffs at 10-1. This
includes a 7-0 record at home,
which is a new franchise record.
The 1992 Stanley Cup Champi-
on team set the previous record
of six consecutive home wins.

-Not including game three’s
statistics, Marc-Andre Fleury is
the playoff leader with 10 wins
and second ‘with a 1.80 goals
against average. On the offensive
side, Sidney Crosby and Evgeni
Malkin are tied for second in the
playoffs with 17 points.

Pirates to Victories

by Zack Chakan
Aaazidtant Sparta E3itor

  

The Pittsburgh Pirates won
six games in a row.

You read that correctly, it’s
not a misprint.

Of course, the winning
streak only lasted a grand total
of three hours or so, thanks to
a defeat in the second game of
a doubleheader to the Atlanta
Braves on Monday, but the sta-
tistic means an awful lot.

How much? The last time
the Pirates conjured up that
many consecutive victories,
John Kerry ﬁgured to knock
George W. Bush out of the
White House.

Kerry’s~ quest failed, much
like the Pirates’ after winning
10 straight from June 26 to July
5, 2004. That team ended up
72-89.

Since Pittsburgh’s last win-
ning and playoff season in
1992, the team has struggled
mightily to play any kind of
consistent baseball. Every time
the Pirates run up a few victo-
ries in a row, they seem to lose
just as many immediately fol-
lowing the stretch.

A perfect example: The Pi-
rates won four straight, April
11 to 14. In typical fashion, the
Bucs lost six consecutive con-
tests, giving up at least 10 runs
in four of those games.

This leads into the exact
reason why the Pirates have
‘climbed within two games of
the .500 mark as of Monday
night. ~‘

Ironically, and almost ﬁt-
tingly, it might have been the
cause of the team’s rough start.

Look no further than the
starting pitching.

Sure, Jack Wilson’s injury
at shortstop and the subsequent
horrifying displays of defense
by his backups is an easy target,
as well as the putrid offensive
slumps by Freddy Sanchez and
Adam LaRoche in April.

But it cannot be ignored
how poorly the Pirates’ starters
pitched throughout April, and
how well they bounced back

'~->Lr~-jr-1:1 <r_:--‘ ‘ 1'
The Pitt News 0 wvvw.p1ttnews.com

during the winning streak.

Pittsburgh’s rotation of Ian
Snell, Tom Gorzelanny, Paul
Maholm, Zach Duke and Matt
Morris fell behind opposing git-
ters early and often, resulting in
hot smashes in gaps, barrels of
walks and insurmountable early
deﬁcits.

The release of Morris, the
team’s most highly paid player,
in late April seemed to ﬂick on
the light'bulb. Since. Morris’
departure, the Pirates’ record
stands at 9-5. v

The new management, head-
ed by general manager Negal
Huntingdon, stressed account-
ability from the get-go, and
manager John Russell echoed

I the mantra. Ridding the club of

Morris provided the message
loud and clear.

Pirate starters gave up only
10 runs during the six-game
winning streak. Highlighted by
two wins from Duke, the staff
might be turning the corner,
although Pittsburgh’s ERA are-
mains the league’s highest.

Early runs doomed the Bucs
throughout the ﬁrst month. The
starters took too long to get in
a rhythm, and by the time they
settled down and got outs, the
team would be down 6-0 in the
second inning. v

Early—inning deﬁcits were
absent during the streak.

Command continues to elude L

the Pirate pitchers, however."As
of Monday night, Pittsburgh
has allowed the eighth most
walks in all of baseball. It also
is last in the National League in

WHIP, or walks plus hits per in—‘

nings pitched.
A few pitchers in particular
are the main culprits.
Gorzelanny’s numbers
sounded alarms until Saturday
night’s win. He’s walked 39
batters to only 21 strikeouts "so

far, including 16 in 12 2/3 in— .

nings before only walking two
on Saturday.

Snell, the opening day start-
er, has struggled to ﬁnd the
zone as well. With 21 walks in
almost 48 innings, Snell is on
pace to walk almost 200 hitters
by the end of the season. He

after first inning

Softball, page 12

Junior Kaitlyn Schuster entered in a jam in
the seventh inning and got the hitter to ground
into a force play. She pitched two innings
overall, allowing only one hit.

Freshman standout Cory Berliner pitched
the ﬁnal 1 2/3 innings, but gave up the ﬁnal
11111.
All three Pitt batters struck out in the top of
the 11th inning against DePaul pitcher Becca
Heteniak, who pitched an 11-irming complete
game. V . ,
Berliner walked the leadoff batter in the
bottom of the frame. After a stolen base, Blue
Demon Marcy Wilus hit a single up the mid-
dle to bring home the winning run.

“We both had great defense and pitching,”
said Phalen.‘ “They were able to put the ball
in play a little more than us, and that was the
dijference in the 11th [ir1ning].”

Three Panthers runs crossed the plate in
the ﬁrst inning. Reba T utt reached on a throw-
ing error and advanced to second base. Ashley
Arnistade walked, and Dignon followed with
an RBI single to center.

Junior Sam Card found herself on ﬁrst
after another DePaul error. Hecker singled to
right ﬁeld to plate Arnistade and Dignon to put
Pitt up by three. . - P

But a key DePaul defensive stop halted
Pitt’s chances of additional scoring. Pitt at-

tempted a double steal, but Card was called

out at home. Hecker was stranded at second,

base.

DePaul manufactured a run in the bottom
of the ﬁrst inning after having no one on and
two outs. The Blue Demons drew even with
the Panﬂiers with a two-run second, aided by
two Pitt errors. Both runs were unearned.

DePaul out—hit the Panthers 10-4.

Neither squad scored again until the fateful

11th inning. Hecker led oﬁ the fourth with a.

single, and Dignon copied the feat in the sixth,
but the Panthers couldn’t move the runners
past ﬁrst base.

Dignon was the last base runner of the
game for Pitt. I

DePaul knocked off Connecticut and top-
seeded South Florida to earn the Big East
Championship crown. 1

Phalen placed the credit on her team for
sticking with the powerful Blue Demons.

“I told them I was proud of the way they
played and they are a great team,” said Phalen.
“We came up a little short against a very good
top—20 DePaul team.” —

Card, Dignon and Zinger were honored
by the Big East last week as well. Card and
Dignon were named to the conference’s ﬁrst
team, while Zinger made the third team.

Pitt hopes to carry its successful season
over to next season. The club returns all of its
pitchers and graduates six seniors.

Panthers crush

singled with two outs, Danny Lopez
drove in Shultz with a single, and Kielty
did the same to plate Conley. The lead
was down to two with two runners on
when Dan Williams walked to load the
bases, but Joe Leonard grounded out too
short to end the game.

Pitt 25, Coppin State 5

In the ﬁnal game of the Panther Clas-
sic, it seemed the only thing that could
stop the Panthers was Mother Nature.

Backed by a 15 spot in the ﬁfth, Pitt
unloaded for 25 runs in six innings when
the game was called for rain.

Jordan Herr went 3 for 4, scoring three
runs and driving in ﬁve.

Lopez hit a two-run homer in the ﬁfth
inning. He ﬁnished the game 2 for 5 with

four RBIs and three runs scored.

Kielty and Leonard both had two hits
and three RBIs.

Freshmen Brian Trymbiski and Zach
Duggan also had two RBIs apiece.

Thanks to outstanding run support, a
solid start byfreshman Hugh Henry re-
sulted in the ﬁrst win of his Panther ca-
reer. Henry went all six innings, giving
up ﬁve runs on ﬁve hits, while also strik-
ing out ﬁve. I .

Notre Dame 5, Pitt 4 (10 innings)

A few Panthers might have had some
new bruises the next day, but that was
the price to pay for tying the game in the
ninth inning. .

Trailing by two runs, Chris Warner
was hit by a pitch to open the ninth. Nick

Mullins was hit by a pitch soon after.
Schultz singled to load the bases, and
then an inﬁeld single by Lopez cut the
lead in half.

With the bases still loaded, Kielty tied
the game after he was hit by a pitch.

Chris Tonte scored the go—ahead run
on a dropped ﬂy by the center ﬁelder off
the bat of Philip Konieczny.

Notre Dame answered back with an
RBI double with two outs to tie the game
and then the winning run, scored on a
dropped pop—up to Lopez at short.

“He had a beat on it. I think at the last
second he took his eye off it, and it hit
the heel of his glove and popped out,”
said Dombkowski, also noting Lopez had
made a few great plays in the ﬁeld earlier
in the game, and heavy wind might have
hurt Lopez’s effort.

Pitt 5, Notre Dame 3

With the game tied at three in the sev-
enth, sloppy defense from the previous
day carried over to help the Panthers.

Duggan reached on an error by the
shortstop with one out. Lopez singled to
put runners on ﬁrst and second, and then
Conley doubled to score Duggan. Tonte
came in to pinch run for Lopez and soon
scored on a groundout by Williams.

Although starter Rob Brant didn’t get
the win, he went 6 1/3 innings, giving up
three runs on three hits. Coming into the
game, the senior was 1-5 with an ERA
over ﬁve.

“He’s been having a tough year, but
he gutted it out,” said Dombkowski. “He
also ﬁelded his position well.”

Dombkowski noted the last batter that
Brant faced as an example of the pitcher’s
defensive prowess on the mound. After
hitting the leadoff man and walking the
next batter, a bunt was attempted to move
both runners into scoring position. Brant
raced forward, ﬁelded the ball, spun and
threw out the lead runner at third.

Ricky Breymier came in and got out
of the jam to end the threat and the in-

earned the victory Friday night against
Atlanta, giving up only two hits and one
run in seven innings, but he also walked
six, narrowly escaping danger several
times.

The winning stretch ended in Mon-
day’s loss in the second game of the dou-
bleheader to Atlanta. Why‘? Spot starter
John Van Benschoten was torched for
nine hits and seven runs in four innings.

He was sent back down to the minors

immediately following the defeat.

If the Pirates have any realistic chance
at a winning campaign, those types of
performances must be a rarity, not the
norm. They won with starting pitching
during the streak, and they’ll win with it
if they perform to their capabilities.

Now at 18-20, Pittsburgh faces a two-
headed monster in St. Louis and Chica-
go on a six—game road trip. The Pirates

the Cubs this year and do not fare well
against the Cardinals away from home.

If they win three of these games, next
week’s home stand looks all the more
promising.

The next 22 games are all against
NL Central foes. If the Pirates can hang
around .500 by the time June 6 arrives,
the city might have something to cheer
about upon the conclusion of the Pen-
guins’ season.
