WWII bomber that crashecl42 years
ago into Monongahela still a mystery

Hillary Stevenson

Staff Wrlter
Bob Sherna cast a long gaze at the

Monongahela. He’s sure the aluminum ,

remains of a World War II B-25 Mitchell
bomber that crashed into the murky waters
42 years ago still lie deep within the river.

Shema anxiously glanced at his watch.
Along with Steve Byers and Pitt graduate
Matt Ptmdzak, Shema has 30 seconds to
get to the middle of the Homestead High
Level Bridge by 4:09 p.m., the approxi-
mate time the plane crashed on Jan. 31,
1956.

"Let's pick up the pace," he mentioned
to his three friends. "We're barely going to
make it before it turns 4:09."

The plane was traveling from Nevada
to Washington, D.C., but crashed into the
river when it ran out of fuel. Six men were
aboard the plane piloted by William
Dotson. Two died from exposure to the
below-freezing temperatures of the Mon.

"The ﬂight plan was to travel from
Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada to Tinker
Air Force Base in Oklahoma, then on to

B-25 RECOVERY

was a Russian defector.

- The plane transported Maﬁa money.

- The notorious Howard Hughes was on

board. Hughes is a "mystery man" from

photos taken shortly after the crash.

- Crew members wanted some company

while ﬂying so they took some Las Vegas

showgirls along with them. '
While much speculation still exists

about the cargo, members of the B-25

Recovery Group are focusing on learning

whether the plane is still in the river. They

think it is.

Because the plane was made with
inexpensive aluminum, which would dete-
riorate in water, Byers said they'll probably
find only the cockpit and an engine or two.

For the last six years they have fought
rumors claiming that the military secretly
removed the plane late at night shortly
after the crash.

"One of the ﬁrst steps in this research
program was to evaluate the issue of
‘covert recovery’ versus ‘mysterious disap-
pearance,-' the latter meaning that the plane
was still in the river, but for reasons
beyond anyone's capability couldn't be
located," said John Uldrich, the group's
founder. "Over time, the issue had become
locked into the mind and consciousness of
Pittsburghers that the 'covert'theory' was
the prevailing one. Looking for the bomber
in the river was deemed the act of a slight-
ly retarded person."

The members of the group certainly
are not abnormal. Byers, the owner of an
area computer business, is an experienced
pilot. Uldrich received a masters degree in
Asian studies from Pitt and currently
teaches marketing in China; Pundzak, a
systems engineer for a Virginia-based
company that handles many government
clients, is a fonner U.S. Air Force pilot.
Shema, who functions-as the group's oper-
ations director, is the senior project manag-
er for Aquatic Systems, located in
Pittsburgh.

"We are all unique, individuals work-
ing toward a common goal," said Pundzak
over a drink at Chiodo's Tavern, which is

Shema and Steve Byers think they can find the B-2 .

located on the river and is known as the
birthplace of many of the theories. "We all
come from different walks of life that

allow us to give something of signiﬁcance ’

to this project."

Pundzak and Byers agree, however, -

that Shema has made much of the group's
work possible.

"Bob knows a great deal about under-
water investigations. Through his work
with side-scan sonars, we think we have
found the plane's ﬁnal resting place," said
Byers.

They believe the plane’s grave to be a
hole created by local companies who were
taking ﬁll out of the river. Because you
need a permitto remove ﬁll ﬁom the river,
and because many companies didn't have
one, no one will admit to there being a
depression in the river, Byers explained. ,

According to Byers and Plmdzak,
rusted broken pieces of cable now drooped
over concrete blocks lining the Mon prove
that efforts "were made to raise the bomber
but failed because the plane had fallen too
deeply into the hole for salvagers to reach.

Thanks to Shema's efforts, all that
remains to be done are diving expeditions
to see if the plane can be located. ‘

Pundzak said that divers from Marion «

Hill Associates went into the Mon when
they started their project, but stopped
because they had no concrete leads. Now
that they have a general location, they may
begin diving again.

Another factor working in the B-25
Recovery Group’s favor is that its mem-
bers have, managed to secure federal pro-
tection of the area of the Mon where they
think the plane lies. Thismeans that no one
except for the group can touch the area.

Beneath _gray clouds and a setting vvin- .

te'r‘s sun that drips rays into the Mon,
Shema and the others stare into a river that
has cradled the truth about what happened
to the B-25 bomber over 42 years ago.
"The most important thing to remem-
ber," said Shema, "is that two people died.
What we have here is confusion, not a con-

CAMPUSFUNDS

"It gets armoying that they put limits
on what I can buy, even though it's my
money," said freshman Liz Pearson. She
also mentioned the fact that
CampusFunds do not allow her to pur-
chase cigarettes — a common complaint
among students.

According to Brinza, cigarettes can't
be purchased with CampusFunds because
it is a violation against the University's
tobacco and alcohol policy.

Brinza said that in retum for restric-
tions on what students can buy,
CampusFunds “provide safety, conve-
nience, and security.”

CampusFunds’ main on—carnpus uses are

in dining halls and at some vending and
laundry areas. "It's convenient that now I
can use CampusFunds for laundry and
don't have to scrounge for quarters any-
more," said freshman Moira McCarthy.
Brinza also said the system that han-
dles CampusFunds, Access 2000, man-

' ages the machines that scan student IDs

for residence hall eligibility, meal plans,
student events, and SGB and
Homecoming voting. Brinza said this is a
major reason no more connections can be
made.

Brinza said she plans to add more olf-
campus customers to the 40 that already
have CampusFunds, but that it will

require extensive lobbying for more hard-

ware to accommodate them. Until more,

equipment is bought, those on the waiting
list will be added if present customers
drop the service.

Also, many laundry and vending
machine areas still don’t offer
CampusFunds.

Some students don’t see the necessity
for a switch, however.

"If you're going to have to pay the
money anyway, why not just pay cas ,”
said Chris Wheeler, a sophomore.

Still others see CampusFunds in a
diiferent light.

Chris McCarthy, a freshman, said
"the school controls enough of my money

already, why should I let them control

more?”

This newspaper often tries to make demands of the
University in these editorials. Usually, we attempt to appeal
to the administration’s senses of logic, justice, fairness and
compassion.

Sometimes that doesn’t work.

But for once, we have an idea that is a win-win scenario

Expand the network for CampusFunds.

If it means ripping out the old network and putting a new
one in,‘ do so, so that more businesses and facilities can make
use of this invention. .

Think about it: As students, we could have more options
for where to spend our money and what to spend it on. The
Oakland business community could ﬁnd a lot more con-
sumers in students if more stores had access to the scanning
equipment

And Pitt’s central intelligence office could keep better
track of students —— where we go, what we buy and what we
do. .
Every transaction we make with our ID cards, every time
we enter our residence halls, every single time we swipe our
cards, somewhere, a computer screen ﬂashes saying who did
what.

We don’t_ know what use this information is to Pitt
Maybe the University decides what mailing lists to sell our
names to. But there’s a plethora of information about us that
somebody, somewhere can access.

, It probably wouldn’t be too difﬁcult for campus police,
if they wanted, to track somebody down, knowing exactly
where to ﬁnd him eating lunch, how long he spends in the
Union pool hall or what time he goes back to his dorm at
night .
So, if Pitt wants to expand this database on students,
tl1ere’s only one way to do it: give us more services.

We’ve been begging for the longest time for a full Zone
1 bus pass to be worked into our Pitt IDs. How about putting
scanners on PAT buses?» Then Pitt could know everywhere
students go and when. . '

. And why this ban on using CarnpusFunds to buy ciga-
rettes or alcohol? Many students thrive on these human
necessities. As long as this information is registered some-
where, Pitt could know what students are prone to addictions,
possible drug use, and whose name to sell to Marlboro’s
mailing list for those gear catalogs.

Pitt could track students better with just our ID cards than
the federal government does with Visa, Mastercard andAIM
transactions, all while improving student life.

For all the scandals
Clinton has been part of
(Whitewater, Paula Jones,
“coffee tapes”), the current
one is the most serious thus
far. No other scandal has
posed as much of a threat to
Clinton’s presidency as
Monica Lewinsky will if she
testifies against him.

Now, the issue here isn’t
how many women Clinton
does or does not sleep with.
He may be a jerk for cheating
on his wife, but it isn’t
grounds for an impeachment.

Don’t get me wrong.
There is nothing I would like
better than for Clinton to get
convicted and forced out of
the Oval‘Office, I just want
to make clear what the real
issues’ are: whether Clinton
committed criminal perjury
by denying under oath having
a sexual relationship with
Lewinsky, and whether he
asked’ her to lie about it while

she was under oath; both of

which are crimes.

_ Former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky was
offered full immunity last
week by federal investiga-
tors. If she accepts and
agrees to testify against the
president, she will ‘not be
prosecuted for perjury.

If she withdraws her Jan.
7 sworn affidavit denying a
sexual -relationship with the
president and provides evi-
dence that he and his close

The Pitt News

friend Vernon Jordan Jr.
asked her to lie about it (it is
obstruction of justice to ask
someone to commit perjury),
it would contradict what
Clinton said in his sworn
deposition in the Paula Jones
case. This may leave him fac-
ing a criminal perjury charge
since, according to
Newsweek, he has‘ denied
having an affair with
Lewinsky under oath.

Clinton may have been
smart enough to get elected
to two terms in office, but he
has made some stupid mis-
takes. The man has absolute-
ly no common sense!
Cheating on his wife may
suggest Clinton has very low
moral .values, and he’s
already ‘admitted to doing
that with Gennifer Flowers.
But the only legal issue, and
the only really important one
to the presidency, concerns
whether he lied under oath
about having an affair with
Lewinsky or‘ asking her to
lie. ‘

The truth might hurt,_but
the truth is always better than
a lie. Honesty is one of the
most important qualities a
person can possess, because
it defines his integrity which,
in the case of the president,
affects every decision he
makes. If you can’t trust the
president to make decisions
with integrity, how confident
can you be that he’s doing
what’s best for the American.
people? ,

I grew up in a very con-

THE PITT NEWS

 

 What’s important, what's peripheral

servative family and was
taught that the presidency
was supposed to represent
integrity. I was taught to
always respect the man who
held that office, knowing
how much the decisions he
makes affect the country.

.Now that a man like Clinton

is president, this ideal has
been destroyed. I can honest-
ly say that I don’t respect

Clinton because he doesn’t

deserve any respect.

vThe public has both a
need and a right to know
what Clinton does because,
as president, his actions and
decisions can affect the
whole country. Now whether
Clinton watches» E.R. and
likes to eat pizza in his free
time isn’t necessary for the
public to know. On the other
hand, if he smokes crack and
makes illegal arms deals (I’m
not implying "Clinton does
this, although it wouldn’t

surprise me) it is necessary-

for the public to be aware of.

Therefore, we do have the"

right to know if the president
cheats on his wife because,
not only does it provide

insight into his character, but

it also affects what he does as
president, such as possibly
committing criminal perjury
and asking someone else to
do the same. _
Right now, Clinton is in
huge trouble. If convicted of
criminal perjury, he will be
impeached and Al Gore will
take over as president.

Corporate types
and hockey
fans don ’t mix

I was covering ‘the Bruins-
Penguins game last weekend when
a revelation occurred to me while
that go0fy—looking plush penguin
mascot was tossing out Bud Ice T-
shirts to all the fans who shelled
out $125 a ticket to sit in the VIP
section of the Civic Arena.

Well, it wasn’t a revelation.
More like a slap in the face. The
game of hockey is becoming unbe-
lievably commercialized.

Between the years of 1987 and
1994, Mario Lemieux would score
and the cheers and shouts were
deafening. Now when Jaromir Jagr
scores, I only hear a faint buzzing
in my ears. And the only time that
sound gets close to deafening is
when the Dick’s Sporting Goods
Fan-O-Meter begs’ the crowd to
cheer loud  LOUDER  LOUD-
which, unfortunately for the Civic
Arena crowd, is still just a distant
ringing sound. _

Ten years ago, how many NHL
players had advertising endorse-
ments for Nike, Wendy’s or Dodge
trucks?

None. Now they do, but at least.

for the time being, Red Wing hold-
out Sergei Fedorov won’t be lacing
up his Nike Air Excel Elites any-
time soon. New York Ranger goal-
tender Mike Richter is still playing
like he ate one too many Junior
Bacon Cheeseburgers, but Mighty

Duck Teemu Selanne drove off in a 1

brand new Durango after winning
the All-Star game MVP. Mad props
to him. .

How many arenas today have
names that don’t include corporate
references? .

Nine of “the 26 respective arenas

" still remain virginal, but if they

ever rename Madison Square
Garden the SONY Center‘ — or
even worse, The House that Wayne
Renovated — then ladies and gen-
tlemen, we know that the corporate
apocalypse has come upon us. ’

How many of you reading this
column have shelled out beaucoup
bucks to see a hockey game at the
soon—to-be Allegheny Energy
Dome? (And don’t include your
student rush prices!)

The Pitt News

Senlor Staff Writer

All indications pointed to a competitive second
half in the men’s basketball Panthers’ 84-73 loss
yesterday to the Syracuse Orangemen. A late ﬁrst-
half rally inched the Panthers to within one point of
the 18th ranked Orangemen at 29-28, and seem-
ingly put the momentum in the home team’s hands.

But four minutes into the second half, the
quicker and more experienced Orangemen explod-

ed for a 16-0 run that buried the Panthers.

“That was the game,” Panther guard Vonteego
Cummings said of Syracuse’s streak “We came
out ﬂat [in the second half] and they took advantage

ofit.” -

Syracuse’s Head Coach Jim Boeheim praised

his squad for the explosion. ‘

“We played as well as we can play for those
seven or eight minutes,” he said “Our defense was
exceptional and every open chance we had, we

Wrestlers dominate four-match weekend

Pitt matmen come two bouts short of perfection, score 33 wins .

Brian Knavish
Staff Wrlter

The combined score in Pitt’s four
wrestling matches this weekend was
Pitt 173 ——- opponents 9. ' .

These numbers are even more
impressive considering the Panthers
inserted some backups into the line-
up against this weekend’s four weak
teams, including Cleveland State,
George Mason,
Duquesne.

In total, Pitt won 38 of 40 indi-
vidual matches, collected nine pins
and five technical falls.

Pitt 43 Cleveland State 0

’ The Panthers started their week-
end of domination early with
Thursday’s 43-0 romping of Eastern
Wrestling League foe Cleveland
State. «

“We went at them pretty hard,”

Marquette and .

Head Coach Rande Stottlemyersaid.
“I always tell the guys that a league
match is a double match. A win is
like a double‘ win and a loss is like a
double 1oss.”

Pitt freshman Shawn Amistade
pulled out a 2-1 win at the 118-pound
weight class to start everything off.

Rob Loper followed by recording
a forfeit at 126, and Blaise-Mucci
(134) and Mike Ziska (142) pinned
their opponents to give Pitta com-
fortable 21-0 lead just four matches
into the contest.

Brian Pardini kept the momen-

tum going with a major—decision vic- -

tory at 150. Pitt followed up that win
with four straight minor-decision
vi_ctories by Jake Schaus (158), Nick

‘ Mengerink (167), John Withrow

(l77),_ and Mark Bodo (190) to sup
their"1ead,to 37-0.

Matt Mueller collected a forfeit
at heavyweight to seal the score at
43-0. -' ‘

Pitt 48 George Mason 0

After Thursday night’s slaugh— .

tering, the Panthers traveled to
Duquesne University on Saturday
for a four-team meet in the spacious
A.J-. Palumbo Center Auxiliary Gym.
Pitt destroyed its first opponent,
the George Mason Patriots, 48-0.
Amistade’ again started things

off with a win,‘ this time an 11-4 8

major decision. Pitt’s Scott Britton
collected a forfeit at 126,’ and Loper

‘ moved up a weight class to 134 and

earned a'12-4 major decision.-

“He was pretty strong. I went out
there and was like, .‘Holy [exple-
tive],~this guy’s got some big arms’,”
Loper said of his opponent Nate

‘Becker. “I figured I was quicker and

faster and could use that to my
advantage.” - ' r

$yracuse’s16-0 second-half
start puts Panthers away

Matt Townsend
Asslstant Sports Edltor

Heading into halftime at yesterday’s tilt
against at the Civic Arena Syracuse, Pitt
trailed 29-28. .

The Panther match-up_ zone defense held
Syracuse to 8-23 (.348) shooting from the
floor. Pitt’s young inside duo of Isaac Hawkins
and Attila Cosby outscored and outrebounded
Syracuse’s more experienced front line.

Pitt was in good shape.

The Panthers led for the ﬁrst 10 minutes
of the game, not giving up the lead until Todd
Burgan drained a wide-open three-pointer
with 10:13 remaining to put the Orangemen
up 16-13. V

Behind freshman Ricardo Greer’s 11
points and six rebounds, Pitt stuck with
Syracuse throughout the first half. Vonteego
Cummings had a chance to give Pitt the half-
time lead, but a shot-clock violation sounded
before he could get off a shot.

“In the ﬁrst half, our defense played well
and we hit some open shots,” said Pitt Head
Coach Ralph Willard.

Then, the domed roof of the Igloo came
tumbling down.

Twenty seconds into the half, Ryan
Blackwell began a redundant second half
theme by scoring an inside bucket to put the
Orange up 31-28.

The nightmare began.

After two free throws by point guard
Jason Hart gave Syracuse a 33-28 lead,
Burgan bothered a pass away from Greer on
Pitt’s next possession and dealt to Hart for an
easy 10-foot jumper.

Following a Pitt timeout, Burgan contin-
ued his thievery after the next Panther posses-
sion, but this time Jarrett Lockhart was the vic-
tim. Burgan sailed in for a easy bucket and a
37-28 bulge.

Pitt was still in good shape.

After 20 seconds on offense, Pitt couldn’t
find an open shot and Hart broke up a
Cummings pass. Hart then dribbled down

court, drove to his right and kicked out a pass '

to an open Burgan, who rainbowed his third

successful three-pointer of the game in as '

many attempts.

“I thought our defense was the dilference

Jim Boeheirn. “Our defense was exception .”

22-48 run by West Virginia  

clooms Lady, Panther hoops

Kevin Lilley
Sports Editor

Shortly after Saturday’s game
against West Virginia, Lady Panther
Head Coach Kirk Bruce leaned back
in his office chair and chuckled.

Then he leaned forward and
grabbed the stat sheet. His smile was
gone.

“Laugh to keep from crying, I
guess,” he said.

Not a bad idea, considering the
women’s hoops team had just
dropped a 86-61 decision to the
Mountaineers in a contest that was
supposed to kick oﬁ” a triumphant
three-game homestand.

Any thoughts of triumph on
Saturday went away early, as the
Mountaineers started the contest
with a 22-4 run and never slowed up.
The run started with two fast, easy
layups, one from West Virginia sea-
son-scoring leader Talisha Hargis
(16 points) and the second from the
game’s scoring leader, Christine
Lambert (23 points). The scoring
would just get faster.

Lambert scored her 23 points in
just 23 minutes of play, hitting on
ﬁve of seven three-pointers and

missing just two of 10 shots on the
day. She was one of ﬁve
Mountaineers in double-digits. Pitt’s
Alecia Balich was the only Panther
in that category, scoring 13 points 011“
the bench.

Bruce was pleased with Balich’s
offensive effort, but quickly added
that, “there are two sides to the ﬂoor,
and we didn’t play much defense.”

WVU scored 16 points in just
over ﬁve minutes, putting the score
at 16-2 at the ﬁrst media timeout. Pitt
sophomore Michelle Katkowski, still
battling the ﬂu, answered by driving
the lane ﬁercely on the tearn’s next
possession, then dishing to Kenosha
Chastang for an easy lay-in.

Before there could be any
momentum swing, though, Lambert
and teammate Rebecca Burbridge
each hit a three-pointer, giving the
Mountaineers an 18-point lead.

“This was hard to stomach,”
Bruce said. “We have no answers to
this puzzle. And we are puzzl .”

The most puzzling stat of the
afternoon, according to Bruce, was
West Virginia’s three-point shooting.
The Mountaineers made nine of 15
shots from behind the are, good for a

cheaper, while the average family
of four will drop almost $300 in
one night at the old pond after pay-
ing for tickets, parking, refresh-
ments, programs, souvenirs and the
like.

Hockey is a sport that is out-
pricing itself. The first Penguin
game I ever went to, 10 years ago,
my father paid $60 for_ three tickets

in section C. If he would have.

bought them at the gate for
tonight’s game against the dismal
New York Islanders, it would have
cost him $200. That’s a pretty
penny for Big Ray Hockey Fan and
his two kids.

And instead of relying on cor-
porate sponsorship to rake in big
bucks for a franchise, the manage-
ment is kicking up' ticket costs to
pay million-dollar contracts to no-
names like Bill Houlde-r, Brent
Gilchrist and Luke Richardson.

To me, those names have some.
significance. To you, Joe and
Joanne Reader, they don’t mean
squat. So why are they making
more money now than any of us
could imagine? ,

Now I am going off on a tan-
gent. Let’s go back to the ripple
effect of commercialization.

The beer-drinking, card—play-
ing, blue—collar NHL audience of

 10 years ago has been replaced by

the Armani—wearing, cell-phone-
owning, martini-drinking crowd
who wouldn’t know who Mark
Messier was if he skated in and
cross-checked one of them upside
the head.

Everywhere I’ look, I see some-
thing corporation-affiliated. The

ceiling of the Civic Arena advertis- ’

es USAirways and Mastercard —
the,Penguins Mastercard. On the
ice, Dodge -hawks its trucks and
Bud Ice urges you to buy its beer —
but beware the Penguins. '

And in the stands, advertise-
ments appear for Ethan Allen,
Coca-Cola and WDVE — which
ROCKS the Pens.

Now come on, how many peo-

ple at Ethan Allen know the differ-
ence between a bed post and a goal

post? And how many million-dollar

NHL men are going to drop their
hard-earned money at the comer
furniture store?

But despite these ad campaigns
and $10" million-a-year contracts,
you know what? I still love this

game.

made it.” V

Along with Syracuse’s hot shooting

(nearly 70 percent in the second half), four
consecutive rniscues by the Panthers fueled
the Orangemen run.
_ “We came out and turned it over four
times,” Pitt Head Coach Ralph Willard
said. “’lhat’s what took the wind out of our
sails.”

Pitt, now 7-9 (2-7 in the Big East), has
lost four straight games and ﬁve of the past
six. The Panthers are in the midst of their
most diﬁicult week of the season, a stretch
including two games versus nationally
ranked West Virginia (one of which is
already a loss) before retuming home to
play Duquesne on Thursday.

The Panthers weren’t able to contain

Syracuse’s leading scorer Todd Burgan,
who connected on all ﬁve of his three—point
attempts to lead the Orange with 27 points.
Syracuse sophomore center Etan Thomas,
who continues to make a name for himself
in the Big East, added 14 points and three
blocks to the win. Cummings had his usual
tremendous game for the Panthers, scoring
23 points while dishing out ﬁve assists.

An inspired ﬁrst half against the more
experienced Orangemen caused reason for
excitement Led by aggressive rebounding

I and a swarming defense early in the game,
Pitt looked poised to pull 011" the upset.

Ricardo Greer’s put-back left Attila
Cosby’s miss put the Panthers ahead 11-5
with 13:24 left in the ﬁrst half. The
Panthers, however, couldn’t ﬁnd a way to
stop Buigan, whose thnee—pointer from the
top ofthe key capped an 11-2 Syracuse 11111

Pitt scrapped back to cut a six-point
deﬁcit to one point with an emphatic dunk
by Cummings. Pitt barely missed an oppor-
tunity to go ahead at the half, failing to get
a shot off with 36 seconds left.

“I thought we were in good shape
going into the half,” Willard said.

But after a competitive ﬁrst half, the
16-0 Orangemen run turned the game into
a rout. Syracuse led by as many as 24 points
in the second half, following a dunk by for-
ward Ryan Blackwell that made the score
60-38 with 10 minutes remaining.

Pitt triedto ﬁght back with a 10-2run,
highlighted by a slashing jumper by
Cummings at 8:40. But two subsequent
Panther tumovers allowed the visitors to
build an insurmountable lead

“We have to pick it up,” Cummings
said “I think we’re playing not to lose

I rather than playing to win.”

Mengerink took all of 43 seconds
for his pin at 167, and Withrow put
together a 17-0 technical fall at 177,
and Bodo matched him with his own
16-0 tech at 190.

Mueller earned a third period pin
at heavyweight to put an exclamation
point at the end of the 48-0 final
score.

“I went out there just looking for
a win,” Mueller explains. “I didn’t
expect a pin to come along, but I’m
sure glad it did.”

The next team in line to battle the

Pitt could only manage a 47-point
margin of victory.

Zach Hasse took over at 118 and
jump—started things with_a pin before

Pitt 35 Duquesne 9

There isn’t much question to
who’s the best wrestling team in
Pittsburgh, and Pitt proved that by

the day.

Brian Legarth, the third 118-

Things returned to normal after

jump the Pitt lead to 19-3.

Mengerink earned a forfeit at
167, Withrow got a pin at 177, and
Bodo received a major—decision win

60 percent shooting performance.

The surprising thing was that Bruce
had diagramed his press defense to com-
bat the three—point threat. The quickness
of West Virginia guards Hargis and
Mandy Ronay served to break the press,
moving the ball up the court before the
Panthers could regroup and retreat to
their own end.

This allowed WVU some open
looks at the basket, including three—point
shots that were often so unchallenged
that Mountaineer shooters could set,
check the basket, check their feet, check
the basket again, and then shoot.

Naturally, this helped explain the
high shooting percentage. Lambert was
the frequent beneﬁciary of such open
looks — three of her ﬁve three-pointers

were virtually uncontested.

“They made us pay [for the press],7’
Bruce said. “They made us pay a lot ‘
today.” ~

The fast—moving Mountaineers also
took Pitt center Nickeia Morris out of the
contest early. At 6-foot—7, the sophomore '
towered over the WVU lineup, but could
not run the ﬂoor fast enough to keep up.
The result was a 39-34 rebounding
advantage for the Mountaineers despite a ,
sizeable height disadvantage. _'

Bruce’s trap was designed to slow i_

_up the game, but proved unsuccessful

Saturday —— not good news for the
Panthers, who will play a speedy f
Georgetown team Tuesday night at the

jumper from just inside the three—point
line. Syracuse now led 43-28.

Another two missed jumpers by the
Panthers, a steal by Marius Janulis off
Cummings and an assist for a Burgan
lay-up increased the advantage to 45-28.

Now, Pitt was in really bad shape.

The Panthers went nearly ﬁve min-
utes without scoring. In the same span
Syracuse connected for 16 points. The
Orange hit two layups, three free throws,
two jumpers and one three-pointer to
Pitt’s ﬁve turnovers and two fouls.

A 16-0 run started the second half,—;_:
and even though there was still a ton of£._§=
game left, it was over. ' 

“We came out and gave up fourg?

turnovers that led to easy baskets,” said‘-E . _

Willard. ‘That just killed us.” -'

. Pitt’s lackluster defensive ,eﬁort sur-
rendered a 17-25 (.680) shooting per.-..
centage. Offense went 2-for-11 from,-'
behind the three—point are: that was the"?
difference in the second half. 

“We just came out ﬂat, and they;
came out with more energy,” said’;-
Cumrnings. “They took advantage of the‘ ‘-’
situation and we didn’t.”
