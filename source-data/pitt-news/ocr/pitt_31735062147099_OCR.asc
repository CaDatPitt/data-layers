Vacancies Filled
_ In Falk Faculty

University Student To Conduct
Physical Education Classes

With the opening of the ‘Falk Ele-
mentary School of the University of
Pittsburgh, Mr. Martin P. Chworows-
ky, principal, announces several
changes in staff.

Accepting a position as director of
the senior house of the Nursery
School of Western Reserve University
in Cleveland, Miss Marie Louise Allen,
author of children's verse, resigned
from her work in charge of kinder-
garten teaching at the Falk School,
which post she has held for the past
three years. Miss ll-Ielen Koepel, grad-
uate of the Child Development Insti-
tute of the Teachers College, Columbia
University, will replace Miss Allen.

Before her ‘appointment, Miss Kee-
pel had been teaching the ﬁrst grade
classes. Her work will be assumed by
Miss Esther Starks, who has been
teaching in the New York City schools
and recently at the Lincoln School of
Columbia University.

Resigning from the physical educa-
tion department to accept a position
in one of the Cincinnati high schools,
Cleon J. Wingard, who recently mar-
ried Lenore Kight, national swim-
ming champion, left vacant his posi-
tion at the Falk School. His work is
now being conducted by M. D. Nilli-
gan, who is majoring in the physical
education department of the Univer-
sity.

Other _appointees to the Falk staff
include Mrs. Anne Davies, formerly
a teacher in the Aliquippa schools, and
now in charge of the third grade
class; and Wilfred Kelly as a teach-
er in the ﬁfth grade, following his
resignation from the Erie County
Day School.

1,300 Students
File Application
For N YA Jobs

The Na.tional Youth Administration
has announced that new freshmen
will be given preference over upper-
class students in the dispensation of
NYA jobs at the University. Mr. J.
G. Quick, University registrar and
head of the NYA committee, said that
40 per cent of the available jobs will

‘go to freshmen.

The NYA Committee is faced with
the problem of assigning 500 positions
to the 1,300 students who have ap-
plied.

“The main thing,” said Mr. Quick,
“is to impress the project directors
with the fact that the freshmen are

I to be given preference.”

Schriloer Heads
Business Group

Elmer E. Schriber, ’37, was elected
president of Pitt Business Institute,
business administration student organ-
ization, at a meeting of the executive
board Friday.

Other officers elected were: vice
Dresident, D. C. Schultz, ’38; treasur-
er, J-ohn Devine, ’36; secretary, Bar-
bara Thomas, ’37; and chairman of
program committee, Janet Wilson, "38.
Besides these officers, the executive
board includes Henry CE-Ialler, ’36.

Continuing the policy of last year,
the board has made arrangements for
a “buzzer” on October 17. The “buz-
zer," according to Schriber, will be a
“general get-together of faculty and
business administration students.”

Students may procure membership
cards from any member of the execu-
tive board or from booth to be set up
tomorrow on the ﬁrst floor of Alumni
Hall.

Faculty sponsor of the group is Carl

Distelhorst, instructor in accounting.

‘ODK Men Approve Of New
Customs Plan,’ Says Head

“Although Group As  Whole Cannot Take Action,
Members Individually Favor The Idea,” Declares
Connolly; Committee For Honorary Body Named

“Members of ODK have gone on rec-
ord as favoring the men’s orientation
and customs program,” says Russell
Connolly, C36, president of Gamma
circle of the men’s honorary all-activ-
ities fraternity,

“The men,” he continued, “did not
wish to pass a resolution favoring the"
plan, because ODK as a group cannot
aid in its furtherance. They did, how-
ever, point out that as individuals they
will do all they can to aid.”

Omicron Delta Kappa, which in-
cludes activity leaders in The Pitt

News, the Panther, the Owl, Men's De- _

bating Association, Pitt Players, bas-
ketball, track, and Cap and Gown, also
ﬁnds its members listed as upperclass
counselors to the ﬁrst-year men. “It
is only in the latter capacity that we
can assist in the program,” Connolly
stressed.

“But it is in that capacity that we
are lending full support,” he conclud-
ed.

The freshman men’s customs pro-
gram introduced this year features
green buttons which entering students
wear until they pass their orientation
test at the end of several weeks. Those
passing the examination, which in-
cludes study of University songs, tra-
ditions, cheers, and administrative of-
ﬁcials, receive blue and gold pins
which they will wear until Thanksgiv-
1ng.

day’s News, in which his name ﬁgured

.prominentl.y,...Paul Keiser, C36, presias.

dent of the College Association, could
not be restrained from making the
following statement:

“It’ll be some dance, you bet.
boy!”

Keiser was speaking of the coming
“Kickoff Informal,” scheduled for Fri-
day night at the Northside Grotto ball-
room. -

Whether or not it will be “some
dance, you bet. Oh boy!” remains to
be seen Friday night, say around 9
o’clock. Dance chairman and College
Association presidents, generally, are
known to get over-enthusiastic.

But the fact does remain that in the
past few years College Association
dances have been exteremely well at-
tended, and have always been consid-
ered the best dance buys on campus.

This year, instead of selling combin-
ation tickets for the two dances to be
conducted during the semester, the
Association has put individual tickets
for Friday’s dance on the market at $1
a couple. It is conceded to be the
most inexpensive assessment of any
major dance here in years.

Fran Eichler’s ten-piece band has
been booked for the four hours of
dancing at the Informal. Eichler has
played for numerous campus affairs in
recent semesters.

Tickets are available in the oﬁice
of the College, [Room 205, State Hall,
in the office of the dean of men, Room
801, Cathedral, and may also be pur-
chased from members of the cabinet.

week upon the Founder's Day initia-
tion and banquet early in December.

Appointed by Connolly, N. Robert
Seidle, Israel L. Goldberg, C36, and
Fred Kiger, ‘C36, will plan for the an-
nual »Founder’s banquet at which fall
tappees will be inducted.

The nominations committee, which
will recommend eligible men for con-
sideration in the ﬁrst-semester elec-
tion, includes Ellis H. Tumpson, BA36,
Theodore W. Biddle, assistant dean of
men, Joseph Madden, C36, and Peter
Noon, C36.

Chosen to recommend honorary tap-
pees were Connolly, 1He‘rrymon Maur-
er, C37, and C. -Stanton Belfour, as-
sistant director of extension division.
Charles Holstein, C36, will attempt to
ﬁnd suitable meeting time for all mem-
bers.

Action was taken at the ﬁrst group
meeting last week to amend the elec-
tion_code, raising scholastic standards
for men considered. The revision,
consonant with new national regula-
tions calls for a minimum quality
point record for the all-University
men’s average. -

Such a change, which would mean
an approximate minimum of 1.25 or
1.3, represents a substantial increase
over the present 1.0 requirement.
Other qualiﬁcations for membership,
which are more subjective than the
scholastic standard, will remain un-
changed.

Employment Rise
Notedln August

Statistics Released By Business
Bureau Show Summer Boom

According to the Bureau of Busi-
ness Research of the University, the
month of August showed a decided in-
crease in employment in the Pitts-
burgh district. The total payrolls of
Augu_st._e.X.Qeed_every month but March
of this year. Another good indication
is that the average earnings last
month were substantially higher than
those of August, 1934. August pay-
rolls were 13.8 per cent higher than
those of August last year.

Despite the slackening of factory
operations usually experienced in the
month of August, the total manufac-
turing did a little better than hold its
own. The iron and steel groups, as
well as glass products, showed an in-
crease of more than one per cent in
employment, and an even greater rise
in payrolls.

In the number of man—hours worked
in manufacturing industries, an in-
crease of 5.1 per cent was noted. The
index advanced from 58.8 in July to
61.8 in August. Increases were re-
ported by all groups except three. The
clay products group, the steel works
and rolling mills, and the machinery
group reported the largest increases.
The number of man-hours worked in
indust_ries_ in August was 15.3 per
cent more than the number in August
last year.

In spite of good indications for the
month of August, last week showed
a. decided drop in business volume
from the level of the preceding week.
In the week ending September 14 the

index of business activity stood at '

72.3. It dropped'to 69.3 in the week
ending September 21.

vice president; junior man, Dale Van
Ormer; junior woman, Lois Follans-
bee; and faculty members, Miss

On News, Owl, Panther Staffs;
Board Votes Its Approval

C36, to the editorship of the Owl, fea-
tured the meeting Thursday afternoon
of the Publication Board, it was an-
nounced Friday. Miss Elmer suc-
ceeds ll-Ierrymon Maurer, C36, who re-
signed because of an unexpectedly
heavy academic schedule.

Maurer told The Pitt News Friday:
“The plans for the 1936 book which
have already been completed have
been turned over to the new editor.
Miss Elmer, however, begins work
early enough in the year to make the
book her own. I look forward to a
1936 volume in the Owl tradition.”

Miss Elmer, who until her appoint-
ment was associate editor, said: “Our
ﬁrst aim will be to make the seniors
feel that this is their own book, an
integral part of their University life.
VVe shall try to capture as much of
that life as possible, through snap-
shots, campus photographs, and dis-
cussions of undergraduate activities.
For the class of 1936, the Owl should
be not only a yearbook,_ but a four-
year-book.”

pointee is the
ﬁrst woman in
eight years to
head the Owl as
independent edi-
tor. The last pre-
vious one in the

Dr. John B. Sutherland

SATURDAY AFTERNOON a. tall, impressive-

looking niansat on one of the several chairs

_ placed in front of the Panther football
squad’s benches. Dr. John B. Sutherland was
watching the twelfth opening game of his career
at the University. _

Less than half a dozen coaches can equal the
record Dr. Sutherland has compiled over that pe-
riod of years. His teams have won 79 games, lost
16, and tied eight times. They have won the East-
ern title in 1927, 1929, 1931, 1932, and 1933. They
tied for that honor in 1925. Not since 1928 has an
Eastern opponent sent one of the Panther teams
down to defeat. That is a great record.

.Yet it is not that record alone which has kept
Dr. Sutherland at the University for a period of
years that, with but two exceptions, is the longest
time any coach in the country has been at his pres-
ent post. Dr. Sutherland is a great football coach,
but he is more than that. . .

A survey of the success his former players are
having in medicine, dentistry, and the business
world proves that the Panther coach was develop-
ing something in . his men other than football
prowess. Many former players now hold coaching
roles and hold them .cap.ab1y . and S110<3eSSfl111Y-
Others of his men, in recent years, have entered
professional football. Coaches of these teams are
prone to admit that Pitt football players are bet-
ter trained than those who come to them from any
other university. _

Dr. Sutherland has never been known to alibi.
Nor has he ever bemoaned in news columns the
fact that graduation has riddled his team beyond
all hope. Dr. Sutherland is not like that. He 1S
sincere andfair in all his work, he is respected_by
The fact that coaches assisting
him—all of them former players of his—always
address him as “Dr. Sutherland” typiﬁes the re-
spect his men have for him.

He is a coach who strives for perfection at all
times and in all things. His players recall occa-
sions when a certain play was run over and over
and over again in practice until the last minute
detail of timing was worked out to perfection. If
it can ’t be done perfectly, Dr. Sutherland doesn’t
want it done. That ’s an incentive to any fellow.

The Panther coach always has the welfare of his
players uppermost in his mind. Pitt teams travel
in style; Dr. Sutherland wants ‘it that way. Rare
are the occasions when a Panther player sleeps in
an upper berth on train trips. At Nebraska last
fall, the hotel at which the team intended to stop
was crowded with delegates to a convention and
the management arranged for the Pitt boys to
sleep on cots in a large room.. When Dr. Suther-
land learned this he promptly marched the team
to another hotel where comfortable beds were
available.

The incident is but one in thousands of those
which show that the man who guides Pitt gridiron

destinies is a man interested in more things than
just winning football games. Pitt can well be
proud of Dr. Sutherland ’s record; Pitt can be still
more proud of Dr. Sutherland.

For his record as a coach, he deserves all the
support students can lend him in the present cam-
paign. For his record as a man, Dr. Sutherland
deserves to stand in the top rank among those who
develop young men.

The Gift Of The word

S SIGNIFICANT of freshman men and wo-

men as are the green button and green

armband, is the little paper-backed book
they carry, titled “Student Themes.” Very soon
these books and the work connected with them
are going tocause some of the ﬁrst year people a
little grief. If they don’t this year, it will be
amazing.

Freshmen at the University, compelled to take
English composition, are apt to _consider the course
and its work a little trying. They have had much
English in high school. They may be fed up on
writing themes. The Pitt News counsels them to
reflect and have a little patience.

The ability to express one’s thoughts on paper
is essential to arounded life in any profession. To
write easily and well is an ability that only too few
possess. The doctor, the lawyer, the engineer, the
business man, the teacher . .. . all must write. They
may write only letters, but those letters they will
need to write well.

Then there are the chosen few who have the gift
of the word. They may write stories, histories,
biographies, editorials, state papers. There will
not be many. Perhaps one in a freshman class of
a thousand will write a novel, a great essay, or a
poem.

The needs of all are met in the University’s de-
partment of English. Percival Hunt, head of _the
department, is a great teacher of English. He is
surrounded by able teachers. These men and wo-
men have made English at the University not a
chore but an opportunity.

If you area vocational freshman, a boy or girl
preparing for a stated role in life, English is one
of your greatest aids. If youare in arts and let-
ters, English is the lampvby the light of which you
may make your way upward. ,

Don’t, then, become disheartened, when the ﬁrst
theme shows that a lot of improvement is neces-
sary. You will never regret the efforts you make
in writing freshman compositions.

Panthers To Meet Westerners
Here In 1937, There In 1938

Freshman football men who are
looking ahead to their three years as
possible varsity regulars can also look
forward to seeing plenty of the Ne-
braska Cornhuskers during that same
period of time. A new two-year agree-
ment drawn up by the athletic de-
partments of the two schools recent-
ly insures annual Pitt-Nebraska grid
battles through the 1938 season.

The former contract would have

ended next year when the Panthers
travel to Lincoln, Nebraska. However,
this latest move will bring the mid-
western eleven to Pittsburgh in 1937,
and the local team will repay that
visit at Nebraska the following year.
This season’s game will be played
here on November 16.

Football relations between Pitt and
Nebraska were started in 1921 whczi
a strong eleven came out of the west
to hand the Panthers a 10-0 white-
washing. Hostilities were not resumed
until the 1927 season, at which time
the set—up of Welch, Hagan, and
company made amends for that earlier
loss by defeating the Cornhuskers,
21-13, in a spectacular battle. From
1927 on, the game with Nebraska has
been an annual event, with the Pan-
thers holding a decided edge as far
as records show. During that time,
the Blue and Gold representatives
have won six out of eight games
played, the other two affairs resulting
in scoreless ties.

Korean Medical Students
Hold A Happyﬂeunion
At Dental School

Two Korean Youths, Long Woon
Whong, a junior in the School of Medi-
cine, and Yu Kyung Lee, a junior in
the School of Dentistry, who played
marbles, or its Korean equivalent, in
their Asiatic village of Pyeng Yang,
were recently reunited at the Univer-
sity after several years of separation.
Wong and Lee are studying to
equip themselves for professional
careers in their native lands, where
they will return upon graduation. The
story behind their reunion at the Uni-
versity brings home the veracity of
that old bromide, “Truth is stranger
than ﬁction.”

Having taken his preparatory col-
lege work at Mt. Union College, Alli-
ance, Ohio, Whong gained a recom-
mendation to Dr. John G. Bowman,
Chancellor of the University, from Dr.
H. McMasters, president of Mt. Union,
in whose home he earned his board
and room.

Whong was the ﬁrst to learn of the
possible meeting with his friendat
the University. Dr. John L. Boots,
former teacher here, had Yu Kyung
Lee as a laboratory assistant at the
Severance Union Medical College in
Seoul, Korea. D_r. Boots recognized
Lee’s excellence and recommended
him for advanced work here.

Consequently, ‘Lee corresponded
with Dean H. E. Friesell of the School
of Dentistry and the latter asked,
Whong to translate. .Whong was de-
lighted to learn that the Writer was
his old friend in the village of Pyeng
Y,ang,.in good old Korea.

Star Cross-Country Runner
Lost To Olson For Season

Sam Musico Undergoes Appendix Operation Thursday;

100 Competitors Race

In Time-Trials Today

Coach 0lson’s prospects for a. successful cross-country season were dealt
a. severe setback Thursday with the announcement that Sam Musico, ace-

performer, would be out for the season
tion.

as the result of an appendicitis opera-

Musico was reported to be resting comfortably Friday, following the re-
moval of his appendix in St. John’s hospital on the previous day. However,
he will be deﬁnitely lost to the cross-country team for the current season.

This loss leaves Olson with just one
letterman, Red Tost, as a nucleus from
which to construct his 1935 varsity
team. It was Musico last year who
paced the Panthers to victory over
Navy, at the same time cracking the
Annapolis record for the four-mile
course with a mark of 19 minutes
and 36 seconds.

Time-Trials Today

Time-trials will be held today over
the Schenley Park course for both
freshman and varsity candidates.
Charley Groat, University record-
holder in the half-mile, and Red Tost,
junior letterman in both track and
cross-country, are favored for two of
theﬁve varsity positions. Gust, Glass-
port High star, and Jim Filson, a11-
other yearling candidate, are good
prospects for the frosh outﬁt.

According to Olson, approximately
100 candidates will strive for positions
in the time-trials. James Potts, as-
sistant track coach, and Charley Gong-
loff, national intercollegiate javelin
champ, are aiding Olson in the track
and cross-country workouts.

Two meets have been secured for
the “B” team with VVest Virginia Wes-
leyan- The ﬁrstcontest will be run
overthe Schenley Park course on Oc-
tober 12. Then, on November 2,; the
Panther reserves will travel to Buch-
annon, West,Virginia, for a return en-
gagement. vThe call is still out for
new men. Equipment will be issued at
3:30 o’clock_ each afternoon.

The blue and gold varsity opens the
season at South Bend, Indiana, a.gainst
the Notre Dame runners on October
1-9. Last year, Pitt treated the Irish

hill-and-dalers to a 15-40 shellacking
over the Schenley Park layout. How-
ever, witn only Tost left from the
championship combination, the Pan-
thers should have a battle on their
hands.

During the week of the Notre Dame
meet, Olson has also planned his
fourth annual All-University novice
track and ﬁeld meet. Competition
opens on Vvednesday, October 16, with
races on the Stadium track. The pro-
gram calls for the following events:
100-yard dash, 440'-yard dash, 220-y_ard
dash, half-mile, one-mile and two-
mile runs, low and high hurdles, run-
ning broad jump and running high
jump.

Included in the ﬁeld events for
Thursday, October 17, are: 12-pound
shot put, 12-pound hammer throw, jav-
elin, discus and pole vault.

Competition is closed to varsity let-
ter or frosh numerals winners of the
past year. Freshmen are urged to re-
port to the Stadium immediately for
equipment. Gold, silver, and bronze
awards will be made in each event to
the ﬁrst three performers:

 

Nifty Nicknames

Pitt football players pick up some
very peculiar nicknames. Johnny
‘Woods is sometimes addressed as the
“\Vest Virginia Snake;” Leon Shed-
losky gets the appropriate “Snake-
hips Shedlosky”; Dante Dalle-Tezze is
better known to some as “Santo”;
and Eddie Quaranti1lo’s name is some-
times shortened to “Eddie Q.”

' fullback Frank Patrick

Panthers Topple
Wolfpack, 14-0

Waynesburg Team Puts Up Game
Fight Through Entire Contest

“Our start today was anything but
auspicious,” said Head Coach Dr.
John B. Sutherland immediately after
Saturday’s game when the Panthers
scored twice on VVay11esbu1'g’s Yellow
Jackets to win, 14-0. Dr. Sutherland’s
remark tells perhaps the whole story
of Pitt's opening game of the season.

The remainder of the story of the
game deals with the ﬁne defensive
play shown by Coach Frank Wolf's
Yellow Jackets. Battling in their own
territory during all of the game but
for a few plays in the ﬁnal quarter,
the visitors managed to stiffen their
defensive bulwarks at just the proper
timesto prevent any high-scoring ac-
tivities by the Panthers.

After a ﬁrst quarter advance which
saw Shedlosky and Randour taking
turns at carrying the ball only to lose
it on downs at the one-yard line, the
Pitt reserves took the ﬁeld and went
right on to a touchdown with but three
minutes gone in the second period.
La Rue, Rector, and Stapulis ﬁgured
prominently in the drive, with Stapulis
going over from the one-yard line for
the ﬁrst touchdown. Rector’s kick for
the extra point was good.

The Panthers’ second scoring spree
came in the third quarter after. a pass,
from Patrick to Randour, placed the
ball on the 22-yard mark. A few
moments later it was ﬁrst down on
the one-foot line and then sophomore
smashed
through center for a great deal more
than the necessary 12 inches. Patrick
missed an attempt for the extra point,
but a penalty against Waynesburg
gave him another try and he made
that one good.

That’s all there was to the scoring.
Statistics show that the Panthers col-
lected 16 ﬁrst downs to three for the
Waynesburg boys and amassed a net
total of 331 yards gained carrying the
ball as against the losers’ total of 116.
Pitt just couldn’t put on the steam at
the right points and the Jackets be-
came tough at the same places.

Pit.t’s two sets of halfbacks sparkled
upon occasions but at other times
they followed interference with little
more system than is used in a rush
for a. Cathedral elevator. The line
did only fairly well defensively and
offensively didn’t appear to be crack-
ing down the opposing outﬁt with any-
thing resembling prompt dispatch.

Pitt's passing attack was far of”
form, the Panthers connecting on
only two of nine attempts. Another
thing which hurt was a total of 50
yards which they lost in penalties.

Coach Wolf should. be ‘entertaining
a few smiles today over the perform-
ances of quite a few of-his men.
notably Koepke, Wasko, and Criss.
Koepke set the Panthers back on their
heels time and again with well-placed
kicks and did a great defensive job.
Wasko, at right end, smeared Pitt
plays with a great deal of regularity.
Criss played a ﬁne game in the sec-
ondary defense lines.

It goes without saying that the
lights will be burning long on the
practice ﬁeld tonight as Dr Suther-
land seeks to iron out the wrinkles in
his 1935 machine. Meanwhile, dO\‘l-ll
at VVaynesburg Coach Wolf will likely
be giving his Yellow Jackets a day off

to rest. They certainly deserved it.-

Intramural Card
Features Three
Autumn Events

Intramural athletics are well on the
way to the top of the sports program
here at the University, promises Mar-
tin J. Feeley, energetic director of in-
tramural activities. To substantiate
this, Feeley points to his record chart
and newspaper clippings recording the

athletic competition during the past
school year.

A total of 1,392 undergraduates par-
licipated in the 10-event program of
last year. Touch football, starting its
second consecutive year of competi-
tion, will again open the novice sea-
son. At virtually the same time,
leagues in soccer will be organized.

Any team desiring entry blanks may
secure them at either the ofﬁce of the
dean of men, Room 801, Cathedral or in
Feeley’s ofﬁce on the third ﬂoor of
Trees Gymnasium. A fee of one dol-
lar must accompany each team entry.
Individual competitors must secure
Dr. Carlson"s OK for physical el-
igibility.

Scholastically, each man must be
carrying 12 credits or more and also
must have passed the same number
during the previous semester. Fresh-

men are excepted in the latter re-
quirement. All groups, includin:-1'
schools, clubs, fraternities, and all

other organizations, are urged to form
teams for the intramural play-offs.
Leagues will be formed with the loop-
leaders entering the ﬁnal eliminations
for the title. Individual awards will
be made to the champions and run-
ners-up.

Social fraternity team entries will
again we handled by the Interfrater-
nity Athletic committee, headed by
Harry Zinsser, Med38, and William
Housel, C37.

The Panther run, an innovation in
this type of competition, will prob-
ably be held during the 10-day rush-
ing period, according to Director
Feeley. This contest will be run for
an individual title over an approx-
imate two-niile on-campus course.
Complete plans for the event will be
announced at a later date. »

‘Fashion Reporter’ Predicts

Latest Styles For Campus

 

Students who were formerly ex-
cluded from the privilege of reading
up on the latest fashion ﬂashes in
the “Fashion Reporter,” semi-monthly
style bulletin published by the Re-
search Bureau for Retail Training, will
this year be admitted to the ranks of
the elite.

Until this year, the elite meant the
salespeople of large downtown depart-
ment stores, to whom the pamphlet
was distributed as an aid in selling.
Now students may get their fashion
tips direct from the eleventh ﬂoor of
the Cathedral, where the Retail Train-
ing Bureau is located, for a small
sum.

The “Fashion Reporter” tells in a
nut shell the latest fashion trends
dealing with feminine needs. In this
month’s fashion sheet, military re-
galia, Grecian modes and the grandeur
and opulence of the Renaissance
period influence the fall fashions.

be seen all day on the campus. Braids,
ﬁles of brass buttons and epaulets will
make the coed’s dresses vie with the
men’s ROTC uniforms.

Incidentally, a frock suitable for the
coming University formal dance would
be a gown with contrasting fabric and
color combinations, such as silver
lame bodice on a black velvet gown,
or maybe a draped evening gown of
the Grecian mode made of reversible
satin crepe, heavy sheer lame, or a
metal shot fabric, according to the
dictates of the “Fashion Reporter.”

eds follow Dame Fashion.

toms Committee, the questions most

No More Slides
To Stadium

Last year the gas lamps on the
University drives were replaced
by modern electric lights. This
summer, another portion of the
campus acquired modern improve-
ments.

For years, students have had to
slip and slide along a mud path to
reach the campus from the Sta-
dium or from fraternity and student
houses on Terrace and Darragh
streets. But no more, for now the
narrow lane which connects De-
Soto street to the upper campus
has been converted into a wide
brick pathway, bridged on both
ends by the conventional Univer-
sity steps.

Freshman Woman Achieves

New All-Scholastic Record

By Idella Rome

Daphne Land, who boasts an Eng-
lish accent and a list of 15 schools
which she has attended during her
14 years of education, is among the
freshman group entering the Univer-
sity.

Enrolled as a pre-medical student in
the College, Miss Land will tell you
that the University is the sixteenth
school at which she has been a stu-
dent.

The opening football game with
Waynesburg on Saturday was the ﬁrst
football game which Miss Land has
attended. But the uniforms of the
Reserve Ofﬁcers Training Corps is
nothing new to her for the ROTC is

also a leading organization in her
native England.
Maidenhead, England, which is

about 30 miles from London, was the
birthplace of Miss Land. Beginning her
education at the age of six, she was
sent to France to a boarding school.
where no English was spoken. And
as the young lady could not under-
stand a word of French, little wonder
she stayed there only two mont.hs.
Some of the numerous schools
which Miss Land attended were: the

Transfers, Junior Women
To Attend Doughnut Party

Transfers will be invited to meet
the other members of their class at
the second annual Doughnut Dunker
for junior women on Friday, October
18, at 12:30 o’clock at Heinz House.

Handbooks containing the program
of events and the news of the class
for the forthcoming year will be dis-
tributed to the junior women at the
Dunker. Mary Gealy, Ed37, chairman
of the social committee, is in charge.

Junior class committee chairmen for
the year are: social, Miss Gealy; ac-
tivities, Mary Losey Rudd, C37; pub-
licity, Martha Bedsworth, C37; sports,
Dolores Hoffman, Ed37 ; ﬁnance, Helen
Snyder, Ed37; and interclass sing,
Betty Bryson, C37.

“Side Lights” Staff

Upperclass women interested in
poster work, writing slogans, or doing
editorial work on the “Sports Side-
Lights,” WAA news bulletin, are re-
quested to meet with Ruth Belle
Strothers, publicity chairman, in
Room 821, Cathedral, at 2230 today.

 

Lycee de Saint Germain-en-laye, near
Paris, the lviaidenhead County High
School, from which she graduated; a
convent called Carresbrook House,
where she spent two years, and a
business school in Massachusetts.
which was her ﬁrst co-educational
school. She also gained some of her
education on the quaint English Isle
of VVright, where people from the
mainland are considered outlanders
to the secluded ﬁsher-folk.

The amount of her schooling in
France and England is about equal.
Nevertheless, the freedom of Ameri-
can schools appeals especially to Miss
Land. While she attended the Lycee
de Saint Germain-en—laye, her brother
pursued his studies at a nearby
school. When the students went to
church on Sunday the boys walked on
one side of the street and the girls
on the other. Therefore, in order to
speak to her brother Miss Land had
to ask for permission to cross the
street and do so.

Although Miss Land has witnessed
many school spectacles in foreign
lands, she declared that Lantern Night
at the University is the ﬁnest school
ceremony she has ever attended.
