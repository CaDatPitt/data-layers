it will not be the staff’s fault. We

have completed our part of the L.

0b1igation.” I

f; The ’47 Owl will clearits books
without red ink, according to
business manager Grover Mc-
Cann, who also handled the ’46
issue. This marks the second ﬁn-'
ancial success since pre-war days.
' The editors have not spared ex-

penses in introducing new fea- '

tures in the year bookﬁlncluded
among the many improvements
are color photographs of the Ca-
thedral, Heinz Chapel, and Ste-
phen Foster memorial.-The sports
section has been enlarged for

more complete coverage. Greater.
stress has been laid upon the tra-

ditional informal photographs’ of

Prom Awards.  
Lucky Couple
Trip to Heaven

When most Pitt.students ﬁnish

classes Friday, April 11, they will .

leave their fancies and interests
of the towering heights of the

I ,.Cathedral domain behin-d them

for another week—e.nd. Such will
not be the case that night with
one Pitt couple attending the
“Seventh Heaven’? Junior prom
at the Hotel Schenley ballroom.
This couple will remain in‘ their
lofty realm when a wish will be
granted to them as winners of the
wishing-well drawing, a. feature
of the dance. A

Morton Lerner. publicity chair-

‘man, announces that in addition

to ‘the granting of a wishﬂto one

couple, each girl will receive an

engraved gold compact at the
door as a favor.

For the beneﬁt of students at-
tending this formal dance, gener-
a1‘ chairman Helen Reis states that
the sale of tickets is limited to
325 to avoid ‘a crowded ballroom.
The adva.n-ce sale price is $4 per

couple, including tax: those sold.

at the door will cost.$4.40. .
Individual students will handle
the advance sales which begin
Monday, March 31. They can also
be ‘obtained
room on the ﬁrst ﬂoor. During the
Week of April 7, tickets will be
on sale at the ground ﬂoor booth.
At this time, those who -bought
their tickets earlier can place
their wishes in the well which
.will then be set up. As the wish
is deposited. the ticket will be
punched to show that the couple

I has made their wish.

Uncle John

Turns Over

John Whitman’s stone has been
rolled again --— it gathers no moss.
Identity ~ of the miscreants who
overturned the slab of concrete
marking John’s position on ODK
walk has not been determined, al-
though persons in no position to
talk have their suspicions.

Back in 1945, Whitman (Uncle
John, as he was known in the Pitt
News ofiice) was a campus wheel
———a very big wheel. In recognition
of his sundry activities, both of-
ﬁci_al and undercover, he was
named man of the year. His name
was-inscribed on a sidewalk slab
and placed with the other im-
mortal names on ‘ODK walk.

Last spring the stone was over-
turned. This week it happened
again. the vile deed being dis-
covered by an alert News re-

A porter who is accustomed to pause

for 60 seconds on his way to’ the
Boot and Saddle to pay homage
to the memory of John.

Special investigators have been
assigned the case by the office
of the dean ‘of’ men. Rumors that
certain faculty members had been
digging for worms in anticipa-
tion of the shark. spawning sea-
‘son in Youghiogheny have been
discounted.

.May Whitman henceforth rest

in peace! .

On Education
Here Tonight

Dr. Robert M. I-lutchins, chan- —,

cellor of the University of Chi-
cago and one of the leading fig-
ures in progressive education in

America, will deliver the ﬁfth in 

the series of Pitcairn-Crabbe
foundation lectures at 8:15 tonight
in the Stephen Foster memorial.

His subject will be .“Is Our Edu- 

cation Obsolete‘?”_ A
One of the pioneers of the re-
cent trend for the education of
adults‘: for leadership in the world
of today, Dr. Hutchins has been

quoted as saying that the world 

may not last long enough for the
youth in our schools to affect the
course of events, and if a choice
must be made between youth and
adults, “the urgency of theetimes
gives priority. to adults.”

He recently took a nine-month
leave from Chicago to advance

two projects. One was the revi-

sion of 24 films which the Ency-
clopedia Britanica issues annu-
ally. He called them “too timid
and too unimagina.tive.” ‘

His second job was to edit some V A

of the great booksof the world.
The new series will be “The Hun-
dred‘Books,” some of which are
out of print. They will be ampli-
fied with intro-dtfctions and es-
says by living world leaders. '
The lecture will be open to the’?
public. * ~ ‘

 I /witénce, ﬂlea4e./ Y

Back in October the Community Chest Fund drive swept the
'.Pitt’campus. At the time students were told thatthis fund
"would be the only to one to which they would be asked to
contribute during the school year. The fund was supposed to
cover the needs of the YMCA and YWCA, and a bushel-basket
full of other worthy groups. ' ~ . ‘

Since that time, students have been maced by the World
Student Service Fund, the Red Cross Drive, and now, accord-
ing to a news story in this week's News, the YMCA-World
Your Fund campaign is out to glean $2000 from the meager
bank accounts, of Pitt students. " 1

Possibly the cynicism of this age is causing us to pro-
test against such organized raids on our collective purses;
-possibly our apathy is the result of such recent literature as
}Sinclair Lewis’ “Gideon P1anish.” _

_ This is not to be‘ construed as a protest against "charitable
organizations, but merely a protest against their methods inso-
V far as We at Pitt are concerned. If the Community Chest Fund
drive is to represent all ‘charitable organizations, then it should
-represent them completely, and not only for the months of
Octobervand November. I ' '

Regardless of the bitterness expressed by Mr. Lewis in.
his widely readnovel, “Gideon P1anish,” we still believe there
is a place for, and a use for, such fund-raising campaigns, and
_ Wouldcontribute gladly if there were one all-inclusive drive
early in the fall semester which would include all organizations
planning to usexstudent purses and wallets as a source of in-
come.

Other colleges in the country have one such drive which

 
 
  
    
    
 
  
  
 
    
   
   
   
  
   
   
   
    
  
   
   
    
   
  
 
  
  
    
   
   
   
     
     
  
    
   
 
    
   
   
   
    
   
   
   
  
   
  
   
   
 

be organized at -Pitt‘! x

Perhaps our newly elected Student congress _can investi-
I gate the possibilities for next year and produce some concrete‘
results to justify the conﬁdence their fellow students ‘have
vested in them. ’

Let’s keep it, in mind for the time being and put it on
‘ the agenda for the ﬁrst meeting next September.
In the meantime the World Youth Fund still wants $2000
. from us.

Dear Editor,

If it is true, as stated in the
Tuesday, March 25,, Pitt News,
that a good student attendance is
necessary at the Nixon Theater
to enable us to continue receiving
reduced «rates why isn’t the
ticket office at 809 C1 kept. open
during the speciﬁed hours as pub-
lished in the paper? _ _. -

On .Wednesday, ticket sales were
closed by 1:15 p. m. when the of-
ﬁce was supposed to be open un-
til 1:30 p. in. We were"casua1ly
told to, come back on Thursday.
The same situation was true re-
garding Henry V tickets. “

Because it’s the Junior prom
doesn’t mean thatwfrosh, sophs,

After all, lots of you went to
the Heart Hop and all of you
don’t have hearts. Do you?

The only closed dances are
those that have tickets avail-
able to exclusive groups such
asthe frats’_ Spartan ball or the

sells tickets at the ground ﬂoor

‘ booth is open to "the entire stu-

if the student [leftthe body and

center in 1943, there’ has been no
graduate : work offered there ex-
cept in biology at the Lake lab on

thepeople who lived in nineteenth century Oakland), people who

One of the families typical

of the era, was the James M.

occupied by the towering Cathed-
ral. The Browne room ‘built in
memory of Mr. Browne and his

Yesterday in a small, old-fash-

memorial to her parents. , '

Beginning at 11’ a. ‘m.,,the ded-

brief.‘ It was concluded with a
prayer by the Reverend Lock-

First ’ Presbyterian‘ church of
Sewickley. f

Miss Browne, who died in 1945,

requested that a room in the

building be set aside as a memor-
ial to her parents and the home
which was located Where the Ca-

W eekend

Pitt Greeks will wear formals
tonight at the IF Spartan ball in
the main ballroom ‘of Hotel Wil-
liam Penn. From 9 p. m. to 1
a. m. the fraternity men and their
dates will dance to the music of
Elliott Lawrence, the ﬁrst nation-
ally-known maestro to play for
a campus event in several years.

Under the direction of SAE’s
Herb Mansmann, plans for the ex-
clusive affair include the crown-
ing of a Phi Kap king and queen
to reign for the evening. Mans-
mann and his committee intend
to make the Ball the year's high
spot in fraternity activities. ‘

Elliot Lawrence is well-known
in the East for his unique style
of dance music and his unusual
combination of the symphonic
with the popular.

The Phi Kaps won the chance
to select one of their brothers and
his girl as king and queen by a
lottery among the fraternities.
The royal couple will be presented
at the opening‘ of the dance to-
night.

at the Lower Merion high schoo1,~

tion. Out of 957 voters, only 400
could ﬁnd, or saw ﬁt to vote on,
the two proposed revisions to the
constitution. ‘

The Battisti measure advocated
that the two-thirds majority re-
quired to pass incoming amend-
ments be based on the actual
votes cast on the issue and no-t on
the total vote count. After a 25
minute argument, the motion was
carried by a six to two vote of
the Congress members present.

Betty Jane Wood an-d Tillie
Sanker contested the move on the
grounds that it violated the word-
ing .of the constitution: “an affirm-
ative vote of two-thirds of the
ballots cast at each respective
election . . .” Miss Wood argued
that the passage of the motion
would make the ‘constitution a
plaything in the hands of each re-
spective congress, and not a deﬁ-
nite standard.

Battisti,’ backed by president
Marshall Levy, contended, “The
loose wording of the constitution
necessitates interpretation by Con-

Congress   Interpret
Constitution —- 6 to 2

Interpretation of» the amendments clause of the Student
congress constitution brought Congress members Bob Battisti,
Betty Jane Wood, and Tillie Sanker into bitter debate, last
Tuesday when Battisti moved to change the previous congress
decision concerning the passage of amendments.

Debate was touched off by the announcement of voting

totals from the recent men’s elec-9- .
gress now and 1n the future-. If a I

precedent must be set, now is the p

    

P .

'— ‘

timevto start.”

Actual life or death of the two ‘.
amendments, (I) a convenience ,
move for the deans oﬁices, and _
(2) a change in the introduction 
of new amendments to the Con»

gress constitution, hinged on the
decision of the Congress. If the
motion had been defeated, the
amendments would have been

killed and no vote would have ’
-been taken at next week’s wom- ,

en’s elections.

John G. Brosky’s recent ap-
pointment to the Carnegie school-
board has made him the youngest
man ever to hold apolitical ofﬁce
in Scott township. After assuming

a his oﬁice, Brosky stated he desir-
ed 'an increase in teachers sal-
aries to place them on a profes-
sional level, and a better educa-
tional system.

In addition to mulling over law
books at Pitt in the morning,
Brosky interviews veterans in the

A afternoon for admission to the
University. His evenings are spent
studying educ-ational programs
and the legal aspects of salary
promotions to keep on his toes in
his duties as a’ school director.

Although his activities have
broadened to include civic re-
sponsibility, Brosky remains ac-
tive in many campus organiza-
tions. Recalling his undergradu-
 ate days, he can tell you about
-Phi Eta Sigma, Delta Tau Delta,
John Marshall, Phi Alpha Theta,
 Omicron Delta Kappa, Scabbard
1 and Blade, ROTC, Pitt News, and
J the Owl. ‘

_ A dual personality is not un-
.. Vdcommongbut Brosky’s seems to
it be three—sided. A graduate of
the College in 1942, he entered
’ law school last fall, and became
assistant to the dean of men short-
ly after school began. Within
three months, the student—coun--
. selor had received the appoint-
.‘ . ment to direct the policies of his

home—town high school. ‘
_While in the Philippines for 39
' months, Brosky wrote a seriesof
magazine and newspaper articles
 about the islands. Following his

SC Crants
Chess F unds

The Pitt Chess club, most re-
cent addition to the activities list,
was presented an allotment by
Student congress last Tuesday to
purchase 10 complete chess sets.

The decision on the part of the
student legislative group to back
the clu-b introduced a marked de-
viation from Congress policy to
date. In preliminary discussion,
Tillie Sanker, editor of the News,
stated, “It’s time that we turned
to activities other than dances.
By alloting $10 to $15 to a group
like this, we’ve made a step to-
ward an activities program to
encompass all students;”

Ralph Mason, president of the
club, made the original request to
Congress at the opening of the
session. Melrose Fleming, presi-
dent of WSGA, moved the grant
with the proviso that the equip-
ment be stored on the twelfth
ﬂoor when not in use. Congress
Voted unanimously to allot the
funds.

There will be no meeting of
the Pre-med forum today, due
to the Scholars’ day program,
or Friday, April 4, because of
the Easter recess.’

Bernard Lefkowitz,
president.

This Phil Seabright-Anna Fich-
ter deal looks pretty good. Being
as they both have convertibles,
especially.

By popular acclaim, Dave May-
hew and Phyl Oesterling have
been nominated the most starry-
eyed couple in school.

Pitt civilization is zooming on-
ward and upward, it seems, with
these pinnings:

Some people still think that
marriage is the thing to do,
though. For instance, Johnny
Wyant and Dolores Harris. The
big event will be in June, prob-
ably in New York, where John
plans to break a_ precedent for
himself and go to work.

Jack Green gets the prize. Every
time he sits down in la streetcar

cause he hates to see all the old

l'llS genius gave wings to words
It was an historic moment. Alexander Graham Bell's telephone
had just spoken its first words——"Mr. Watson, come here, I want you!'.’

That evening in Boston——March 10, 1876--Dr. Bell’s crude

instrument transmitted his voice only to the next room. But out

"~ of it was destined toicome a whole new era-the era of quick, easy
nation-wide telephony, of radio telephony in all its varied forms,
of talking pictures, voice, and music reproduction systems and
electrical aids for the hard of hearing. Few inventions have played
a greater part in shaping the world we live in!

Since 1877~ just one year after Bell's long experimentation was
crowned with success——it has been Western Electric’s privilege to
help carry forward his great idea which gave wings to words. In
that year Western Electric made its ﬁrst telephone. More than
45,000,000 have followed it— over 4,000,000 of them in 1946 alone.

Today, from coast to coast, in factories, oiiices, distributing

' houses and central office installation crews, there are more than
110,000 Western Electric workers. Imbued with the Bell System
spirit of service, they are helping to provide equipment in record
quantities to meet telephone needs far beyond any envisioned by

This year marks the 100th Anniversary of Bell’s birth is
Edinburgh, Scotland, on March 3, 1847. From early youth,
he was keenly interested in aiding the hard of hearing. He _
became 2. teacher of "visible speech" when 18 years old.
This work led to experiments with “telegraphing"
sound, out of which, in 1876, came his greatest invention

Dr. Bell was a great humanitarian as well as a great sci-
entist. His accomplishments——in aiding the deaf, in com-
munications, in aviation and other f1elds—were outstand-
ing. His rich life—which had an incalculably great inﬂu-
ence on the world—came to an end on August 2, 1922.

Oratorical Victory Places
Rozanski In County Finals

, :3 .

History is all set to repeat it-

self Wednesday, April 2, when 

John Rozanski will carry the Pitt
colors into the Allegheny county
ﬁnals of the Hearst oratorical
contest for the second consecutive
year.

In the competition scheduled
for 8 p.m. in Stephen Foster me-
morial, students selected from the
ﬁve Pittsburgh colleges will vie
for the honor of representing Al-
legheny county in the collegiate
division of the mid—western zone
ﬁnals.

Rozanski, pre-law student in
the College, is a man of various
talents. He has always been in-
terested in dramatics and discus-
sion groups, and for two years
played tackle on the varsity foot-
ball team at Pitt. Last year, as
county representative to the zone
ﬁnals in Chicago, he came home
with third place h-onors.

In the speech which won the
Pitt semi-ﬁnals for him, Rozan-
ski emphasized Patrick Henry’s
ﬁght for the issue of human lib-
erties. “We should all be individ-
ual Patrick Henrys and ﬁght for
a World of peace and liberty,” he

declared.

Davis Yohe was chosen as al-
ternate delegate to the county ﬁn-
als. The Pittsburgh student who
wins this competition has a chance
to be a hero in his own city, since
winners of the zone contests will
meet in Pittsburgh Thursday,
May 1, in the national ﬁnals.

A $250 savings bond
prize in the college division. Oth-
er awards are U.S. Savings bonds
of $100, $75, $50, and $25 de-
nomination.

Spring Football Practice

Hampered by inclement «Weather, Coach Mike Milligan is

hilltop practice ﬁeld above Pitt

stadium with approximately a hundred candidates working out.
Most of the work during the past two weeks has been

running, and conditioning.

The backﬁeld men have been running from the single wing

selves with Milligan’s system.
Coaches Dick Cassiano and Josh
Williams have been working with
the backs and have been consid-
ering every man for the open po-
sitions.

Among the backﬁeld candidates,
Paul Rickards, Wheeling, and
Tony DeMatteo, Pittsburgh, are
beginning to show some of the old
form. Bob Hum, Columbiana, and
Tom Kennedy, Midland, up from
last year’s Jayvees look very
promising and may move into
varsity positions.

On the line, tackle replacements
present the ‘greatest problem for
Coach Milligan to solve. During
practice sessions to date, Sam De-
Fede, Martins Ferry, and Ferdi-
' nand Wieclaw, Donora, have
shown a lot of ﬁght and ability.

Another group of 30 men will
report to the Panther,mentor on
Monday. This group will include
most of the 1946 lettermen.

Practice uniforms are still
scarce. Although about 15 men
have dropped from the list of
original candidates, more than
that number are seeking suits.

First Round

The ﬁrst round of the univer-
sity intramural 'basketbal1 play-
offs have been completed. Eight
teams survive out of a field of
sixteen.

This process of elimination will
continue until the number of
eligibles has been narrowed down
to two. The ﬁnalists will square
off at Pitt stadium on Monday
night at 7 o’clock for the ﬁnal
reckoning.

The eventual winner will rep-
resent Pitt in the inter-school
playoﬁs with Carnegie Tech. Par-
ticipants in the present playoffs

' consist of the winning ﬁves in the

various intramural leagues and
several top—ranking independent
teams. 1

. The tip-off against Tech has
-been set for Tuesday evening,
April 8, on the Tartans ﬂoor.

In the initial round, only one
champ, the Benedetti club of the
phys ed loop, was knocked out of
the running. A strong YMCA en-
try dropped the Bennies, 49-35.

Ironically enough, the Douglas
ﬁve, which ﬁnished second to the
Benedettis in phys ed league play,
remained in the playoffs by
dumping the Isentropi-cs, 43-25.

Other league, titleholders who
captured victories were PiKA,
frat king; Bus. Ad., All-Star loop
champions; and Psi Omega, den-
tal league titlists. '

If you can tag a baseball, gen-
tlemen, the man to see is Ralph
Mitterling.

A telling deﬁciency of last sea-

son’s baseball team was the fact

that so few men could apply the
wood to the cowhide with any
real authority. “Wewere awfully
weak in hitting,” said Coach Mit-
terling rather dejectedly.
Smodic and Art Barnes were our
only long-ball hitters, so we’ll
need more this year.” ’
Coach Mitterling, however, is
fortunate in that practically all
of last season’s team, plus Veter-
ans of other years, are back for

‘another season of ball.

Although it is still too early to
judge the effectiveness of the
pitchers, several holdovers are
ﬂashing plenty of speed and hop
on the ball. Daryl Calder, whom
Mitterling describes as “a good
boy,” George Goldberg, returned
from the ’44 squad, and Bobby
Lucchino, a southpaw returned
from the ’45 team, have been par-
ticularly impressive. The only ac-

curate test, however, will not‘

come until batters are placed in
the paths of their pitches. Just
h.-ow soon that will be is strictly
up to the weatherman.

Only one member of the 1946
inﬁeld was missing when the call
for inﬁelders was issued last
week. That was ﬁrst baseman
Clyde Marciglio, who has gradu-
ated.

Art Barnes returns to try to
hold the fort at secon-d, while
John Kuzio will defend his hot
corner job. John Wascieko, the
other inﬁelder, has cast his lot
with the catching candidates.
Originally a‘ catcher, Wascieko
was shifted to the inﬁeld during
the latter part of last season.

Football managers a r e

becoming. a manager should
report to Val Castrodale any
