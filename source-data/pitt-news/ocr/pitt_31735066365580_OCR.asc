Uncle Sam wants Little s i’

Student drafted for draft board

by -DON NA ADOMITES

Frank Little recently got the
word. Curtis Tarr, head of the Se-
lective Service System. wants
him.

Little is one of three new mem-
bers of local draft board number
14, a five-member board serving
the district encompassing Oak-
land. the Hill, Downtown, and
part of the North Side.

Acting on an article in the Post-
Gazette, Little, a senior at Pitt.
forwarded a letter and application
through the network of 10 local
draft boards to the Pennsylvania
Selective Service Commission for
processing and certification.

The basis of his appointment,
along with thousands of others
across the nation, is the draft ex-
tension bill which lowered the
minimum age requirement for a
place on the boards from 30 to 19.
It also stipulated compulsory re-

 tirement at 64 or after 20 years
of service and required that com-

position of the board reflect the
racial and ethnic composition of
the community under its jurisdic-
tion. .
Because of the institution of the
lottery system, Little views his
job as essentially administrative.
with much of the arbitrariness
removed. ’

“The only opportunitvfor a val-
ue judgment is with the Hardship‘
Deferral File,” he said, “where
value judgments occur, I see my-
self as being more lenient. You
don’t have tofbe a preacher to be
a CO. Still, if a guy came across
in an appeal as insincere, I would-
n’t give it to him. Someone has to
go. If I voted in favor of the un-
deserving, that means someone
with a higher number—maybe 11
or maybe 13Q—would have to go.”

. “I would love to go in there with

two other .. freaky. radical mem-
bers and take over,” Little con-
tinued. “I would provide moral
support for the other new appoin-
tees. I heard many, members are
quitting in outrage at the pros-
pect of 19-year-olds_on the boards.
It all depends on the other two
members.” A ’
MAKING THE SYSTEM WORK

Can a man who supports the con-
cept of a volunteer army and who.
in fact, regrets the need for

armies, find happiness on his 10-,

cal draft board? Little seems to
think so. ‘

LITTLE
“Someone Has to Go”

“All the talk about tearing down
the system never got us any-
where. Like Kent State. Wegot
heads busted and people killed.
that’s all. I was very upset about
the number of people who didn’t
vote in the last election. People
worked so hard for the 18-year-old
vote. then said it didn’t mean
anything.” ‘

“You’ve got to make the sys- A

William Kunstler Wednesday at 8

speakers will debate the topic:
“The rulings of the Supreme

* Court tend to be protecting crim-

inals at the expense of law-abiding
citizens and society in general.”

thers. He has lately specialized

and civil disobedience. notably in

defense of Baltimore draft-rec-
ord burners and in the "Chicago

Each speaker will give a 20-min-
ute speech. After both speeches,
questions from the audience,
which need not be limited to the
debate topic, will be entertained.
Cross examination by the speak-
ers will not be permitted.

In addition the chair will re-
quest each speaker to comment
briefly upon the following ques-
tion: "What effect will the ap-

Court have upon its future deci-

“The thing I would like to see

ed in Berkeley, where students in

radicals—gained majority control
of the city council. But Pittsburgh
is different from Berkeley. There
councilmen are elected by dis-
trict. With Pittsburgh’s at-large
system, five guys from the same
part of town could get elected.”

The re-organized local 14 has
yet to schedule its first monthly
meeting. Meanwhile. Little has
done some preliminary investi-
gating of his fellow members but
has rooted out‘ little information.
For now. he’s reserving judg-
ment. citing the attitude of' pros-
pective employers who stereo-
type students as an example of
what he seeks to avoid.

“They could be Archie Bunkers.
or they could be really hip." he
said. While admitting that he has
his suspicions, he intends to let
the interaction of the-“meetings
themselves confirm or refute his
opinions. _ .

RESPONSIBILITIES
LIKE CREDIT CARDS

If any one factor could be said
to govern Litt1e’s involvement in
extra-curricular activities on
campus, and now his venture into
community action. it is his curi-
osity. laced through with a meas-
ure of self-interest. I

Little collects responsibilities
like some people collect credit
cards. The Student Association’s

ball and basketball. and the Uni-

“A lot of the parking problemshave been solved
with the installment of the parking lot near Tree’s
Hall and the expansion of the lot in Panther Hollow,”
she said, “so this is a good time to concentrate on

social activities. "

Masilunas explained the difficulties commu--
ters have in traveling to and from the campus in in or-
der to attend any offered social functionsyas a rea-

son for many feeling “out of it.”

“Since over 60 per cent of the students at Pitt
are commuters and pay the same activities fee
that the people on campus do, they deserve equal
participation in campus events,” she said. -

A special project Masilunas plans to undertake
is to make overnight facilities available to com-

muters.

ends that could be used by commuters who want to

Attributing the foul-up to the

"said that the programming of ex-

and a leaky vessel.

Along with 13 other Pittsburgh-
ers, Mary Ann and Campie set out
for Miami Dec. 18. Armed with

' sleeping bag, a pillow, a duffle

bag, plenty of T-shirts and jeans.
the women arrived in Miami 26
hours later.

This little excursion itself was
noteworthy as six others, along
with Campisano and Gunselman,
traveled to Miami in two cars, a
Volkswagen and a Volvo.

At their first stop, Bimini, the
awed travels began to encounter
the first of their many difficul-
ties.

Trying _to dock their 50 foot sail-
boat at Bimini, the crew got stuck
in a small sand bar and, as they
tried to thrust their way out. the

mation, said Dutton, might allevi-
ate the registration problem.

He also proposed a Registration
Invoicing Complaint Center, sep-
arate from the registration office,
where students could go to air
gripes and problems.

At last week’s open hearings on
registration, Dutton noted that it
would be impossible to "sell. de-
sign, and implement a new sys-
tem by March,” and that "we
must continue patching the pre-
sent system.”

The effectiveness of class sched-
uling, close-outs, and the add/’
drop procedure was also discuss-
ed by the Council.

Gene Richardson, assistant to

Dutton, said that “add/drop is

rising at a phenomenal rate.

Because of» scheduling conflicts
and the increasing number of
closeouts, he said, the system "en-
courages students to sign for ev-
erything and then add/drop.”



rear of the boat leaned perilously
toward some jagged rocks. This
‘"minor” problem was ironed out
though, and the women were
ready for a swim.

"We weren’t even in the water
when the others came running out
of the water yelling, 'Shark!"
said Campisano.

At this point, Gunselman was

. attacked by a swarm of mosquito

type bugs, which had never been
encountered on any of the pre-
vious trips.

"Iwas bitten all over my body,"
she said. "The natives called
them ‘no see ‘ems’ because you
couldn’t see them. I looked like a
pickle." ~

By then, it was time to move on
to another island. Cat Cay. L

Along the way their boat, Shark
6, bypassed millionaire Howard
Hughes’ private island. .

"What a dissappointment." re-
lated Campisano, “there couldn’t
have been more than two huts on
the whole island.”

LIKE A MacDONALDLESS
MOVIE

About this time it began to rain.
The forecasters termed it a mild
rain and Shark 6 saw no reason not
to continue.

"The mild rain turned. into'a
near hurricane,” said Campisano.
"It was a ‘code 3‘ storm. A ‘code
4‘ is a hurricane. We had to esti-
mate our speed and location as
well as cope with 50 mph winds.”

“We were supposed to find Rus-
sel Beacon,” continued Gunsel-
man, “and we couldn’t locate it.” ‘

Not being able to find Russel
Beacon in the middle of a “code
3” storm at midnight in the At-

lantic Ocean sounds like more
than the women bargained for. but
it was probablya blessing in dis-
guise.

"About 12:30, we came to a
crunching stop,” said Gunselman.
"We were caught in four feet of
sand. We couldn’t get help from
the Coast Guard because there

were approximantly 30 ‘maydays’
from other boats.”

“Yeah,” said Campisano, a
mayday means you’re sinking and
we were only distressed. I wasn’t
afraid. I knew we couldn’t sink in
three feet of water. I knew we .
weren’t going anywhere, but I
knew we wouldn’t sink.” I

“It was like being at a movie,”
added Gunselman. “The only dif-
ference was that after a movie,
you can always go to MacDonald’s
for a hamburger. There weren’t
any MacDonald’s out there though.”

Being in shallow water was com-
mon for the crew. At least they
weren’t at the tongue of the ocean

dampen Xmas cruise

where the water was 6,000 feet
deep. Yet. ,

During their stay in the stand,
Shark 6 heroically assisted the
Coast Guard in locating other
ships who were sinking. Using the
longitude and latitude of Shark 6,
other ships were located. Shark 6,
onthe other hand had to wait for
high tide the next day, Dec. 23.

As the tide lifted them from the
sand bar, the ship spent the next
day trying to reach Chub Cay. As
it got dark. the crew was trying
to find Belle Bouy. Not being suc-
cessful, they anchored at what
they though was Belle Bouy and
spent the night. ;

In the morning they found that
they were actually anchored in 6,-
000 feet of water at the tongue of
the Ocean.

“I’m so gladl didn’t know that
until next morning,” said Campi-
sano.

When the ship finally made it
to Nassau, they found that the
boat had sprung a minor leak and
that one of the members had come
down with hepatitis.

They-went to a Christmas party, .

pumped the boat, and headed back
to Miami.

Not after they all paid a visit to
the hospital, however.

The trip back to Miami and
Pittsburgh was “uneventful”
compared to the first half. Ex-
cept, someone had to constantly
operate the hand pump. But, both
women agree that the trip was a
beautiful experience. Both would
and plan to do it again.

“It’s the only way to see the is-
lands," concluded Campisano.

Ah, Christmas in the Bahamas.

Approximately 3,300 University
non-union staff employees will
soon acquire representation
through a Staff Advisory Board to
Personnel.

The Board will be a representa-
tive body in that it will be an elect-
ed rather than an appointed body.

The Board’s objectives, which
will generally involve decisions af-
fecting the University staff. will
be drawn up by the Staff Advisory
Board itself. A .set of operative
recommendations will be present-
ed to the Board from the various
committees leading to the elec-
tion, particularly those guidelines
of the Ad Hoc Committee.

However, it is expected that the
Board will take its direction from
the constituency of the 3,300 staff
members.

Delegates, committee workers wanted

Young Dems 0 seek active students 

by RICH EULER

As the 1972 elections approach. Pitt‘s College
Young Democrats are encouraging students to run
for positions as delegates or party committee work-

€I‘S.

Ron Brown. president of the Young Democrats.
stated. “Since there will be nine candidates in the
Pennsylvania primary and each will place his own‘
delegates. there should be plenty of positions avail-
able. Because these primaries are so important. we
want to insure a fair representation of young peo-
ple, and are anxious to meet any students who would

be interested.”

Brown added that the Young Democrats are
also interested in having students run for positions

as committeemen or women.

“Most students have a negative conception of
the committee worker,” said Brown. “They tend to
think of him as a ‘yes man,’ but, actually, the com-
mittee worker has a great deal of freedom. Work-
ing within his voting district, he can influence the
selection of candidates and become an independent

force on the local level.”

As yet. the Young Democrats have not voiced
support for any of the announced Democratic presi-
dential hopefuls. Such an endorsement is expected
within a month but until that time. the Young

The issues in this election are
not apathy on the part of students
or honesty in government.

The issues are whether or not
the student body is going to con-
tinue to get'so little for so much
at this University; whether we
will accept a reduction in services
at an increase. in price at the

Health Center; whether we will “

continue to accept.the Universi-
ty’s refusal to put any money into
aadecaying Student Union, using
as an excuse the promise to build
a new one (a promise that‘ cannot
realistically, be realized for at
least 15 years); whether we will
accept a Campus _Police force

plagued by inter-departmental "

bickering and sometimes ignoran

. of basic civil liberties. I . '
This year, Student Government‘ ’

attempted to move in these,areas.s
We re-established the Legal

’ Awareness Committee and under ,
Bob Ging they handled hundreds ‘

of cases ranging from parking
tickets‘ to felonies. We have a
Health Service Committee that is
trained to handle health referrals
ranging from eye glasses to abor-
tions. - .

I succeeded in breaking a 60-

year old monopoly held "by the
manufacturer of the Pitt ring. to
establish competition and greatly
reduce the cost of the ring.

These are the student services
that make the real issues for my-
self and my party,‘ the Student

Service Party. I know them be-

cause I,_ have been fighting for
them for two years and I have the

tial aspect of student life. Unfor-
tunately it has broken d'own‘in its

ability to assume this role. This

has been caused by its own bu-‘

_ reaucracy and the personal inter-

ests of the students" involved. SG
must improve-its communication
with students and must make its
programming work to earn the
respect and involvement of stu-
dents. .

I am an engineer. It. like many
other sections of our student
body. is more or less ignored. It is
too easy for SG to pick up a popu-
lar cause or special interests and
pretend to be a relevant governing
body.

'It’was disappointing to me that
voting booths were not in Bene-
dum Hall, especially'when there is
great need for student involve-.
ment. I-have been in the dorms for
three years and I unders_tand the

food service conditions, the secur- '

ity conditions, especially the
growing harassment of women,
residents. ’

It is unfortunate the “who you .

know” qualification for .RA’s. I
am presently a member of the
Committee on Student Organiza-
tions for SG and have come in con-
tactwith a wide cross section of
student interests. Students should
be- made aware of the activities
-available to them and SG should
provide increasing service to or-

ganizations whether it be finan-

cially. or‘ increasing facilities for
meetings, or other means. ’

I hope to accomplish two basic
goals through my election to the
Board: 1) to bring function, -util-
ity, and purpose to the Student
Government, and 2) to serve as a
liaison between the SG and the

. student body, especially in regard

to the utilization of student mon-
ey.

SG has, for the most part, been
removed from student contact,
looked upon as useless, and some-
thing to to entertained with as
read about in the Pitt News. I
thinklall candidates wish to solve
the SG, "usefullness-—-credibility
gap” and if those elected cannot
provide the solution, the SG can
find no reason for existence.

As business director of WPGH
and account director for the CA, I
have gained a high degree of un-
derstanding and an avid interest
in the allocation of the activities
fee. The students at this Universi-
_ty don't know the ‘gross amount

collected,‘ under what criterion,‘

priority, or method it is allocated,
or where it is distributed.

From my position on the board
I can find and release this infor-
mation, complete and in an organ-
ized fashion. Up to now the only
source of such information has
been a series of-irregular “leaks”
that have splashed through the
Pitt News — destroying the cred-
ibility of'SG and harming that of

I the publication-

I will support broad-based pro-
grams beneficial to the students,
but these proposals requiring ad-

  

\

— ditional direct payment by the-'

student will come under close ex-

amination, and if possible be op-

tional (i.e. student health insur-
ance).

As an office seeker, my biggest
concern is the budget. Yearly
there is a $250,000 fund to be
used to allocate for various and
to various student activities. ‘

Through the use of a guaranteed
student survey, I propose to find
out where the correct amount of
money should be appropriated. I
strongly feel that a great deal of
the $250,000 yearly should go to
improvements in the Student Un-
l0l’l.

Improvements in the Student
Union would benefit the commu-
ters, the dorm students,,and the
off-campus students. General pro-
posed improvements include a
new color TV with an antenna, a

separate pin ball room with the.

acquisition of new pin ball ma-
chines, thus also fixing up the
games room. Through this bridge
tournaments, checkers tourna-
ments and even, yes even propos-
ed pin ball tournaments.

Not only would this create bet-
ter facilities but better harmony
among students. These improve-
ments in the long run would pay
for themselves. In the Trees Hall
building plan, there were original-
ly plans calling for a bowling al-
ley. Ten alleys could still be built
at a nominal cost as the space is
still there, yet only the alleys wait
to be put down at approximately
a cost of $50,000.

Expenditure of the "campus ra-
dio station is alsovery important;
WPGH has the capability and the
people to become a top-notch sta-
tion. If they could go FM on a
large scale, it would be a big
boon to the entire University.

Myldecision to run for the office of SG Board

member is based on a strong dissatisfaction with

both the image and substance of student govern-
ment at Pitt, and a desire to initiate programs which

‘ would involve more students in the proceedings of

student government.

The current common image of student govern-
ment as a behind-doors operation removed from
most students and their interests can only be dis-
pelled by. student government activity seeking ‘to
involve as many‘ students as possible in its func-
tions of committees must be enlarged, and the dates
of meetings and topic for discussion should be wide-
l,y publicized. Perhaps a large advisory committee
of students, chosen by lot, could be convened twice
a term to provide the SG Board with suggestions
and opinions.

While campaigning for the office of Board
member, I discovered that many students were not
aware that elections had been scheduled. I believe
that the elections should have received extensive
advertisement at least three weeks before the elec-
tions were to be held, and personal letters should
have been sent to students informing them of the
offices to be contested, the procedure for declaring
candidacy, and the time and places of the elections.

Such important questions as improved services
for commuters, fair treatment for nursing students
by student government, and a more just distribu-
tion of allocations are to be decidedon Wednesday.

‘Student Government at Pitt is
at a crucial point. In recent years,
i.ts legitimacy and necessity have
come under question by the stu-

_dent body. Therefore, this new

Student Government should be

1 elected to be more sensitive to the

feelings of the students.

This new Student Govern-

_ ment can begin to reestablish its
T" legitimacy by becoming a forum
V  g of expression for student opinion.
 This Board should actively pro-
_ mote the interests of the student
body in anything that affects them _

on campus.

 , This is what I would like to do,
 for you on this Board—express ‘
' ‘*viewpoints of the students with-
in this University.

 

It is a fact of nature that the butterfly, in its life
as a caterpillar, has consumption as its sole aim.
After its metamorphosis, the butterfly lives on that
which has been consumed in its previous stage, and
concentrates on the "art of reproduction.

I have spent two and one-half years at Pitt liv-
ing in a cocoon, observing Student Governments
and absorbing ideas and opinions of what exactly
this University needs in a Student Government.

I would now like to capitalize on what I’ve ab-
sorbed working with the Pitt News, WPGH, and
simple conversations with my fellow students, by
working through Student Government to produce
those actions which we, the students, want.

I would like to see Student Government apply
itself in the area of the Student Health Service,
working either to reduce, or preferably obliterate,
the recently declared fees for certain services for
which the students are already paying the Univer-
sity. ’ ,

The word apathy is on the brink of becoming
cliche. However, it is still a force with which we
must contend. This year a new SG has come into be-
ing, allowing for a new, more centralized Student
Government. -

This government may work, but only if we, the
student body, become involved.

So, more than I ask for your support, I ask you

Just what is the purpose of Student Govern-
ment? Is it supposed to provide services to the stu-
dent body, services such as Student Health and Le-
gal Awareness? Or is the government, to provide just
entertainment? '

Pitt will never have an effective government
until the students start getting involved.

Now you say “here is the old apathy bit” and it
is. But this is the maintproblem with Pitt’s Student
Government. The Student Government has to work
within the administration. The administration looks
at the Student Government and laughs, but for good
reason. Out of several thousand students only some
900 voted in last year’s election for Student Gov-
ernment. '

Why should the administration listen to a few
students who have a title, but don't represent any-
body? We the students must work to make the
Student Government legitimate.

Now we here at Pitt have a new constitution
for student government to work within. There were
eight people who wrote this document, I was one of

them. I felt we did a good job. But all my work

could be destroyed if the wrong type of people took
office. ‘ “

That is why I’m running, to follow up on the
constitution and to get in on the right foot. I want
to make Student Government strong. But I need
your vote. So on Jan. 19 vote for Charles Steeber.
Or if you feel Student Government should be weak
and useless, vote against me. But please vote.

A BlQPHYSIClST'S ANSWER TO WALDEN TWO

Ken

éﬁoa/ul

I would like very much to be-
come a member of the Board of
Student Government at Pitt. The
new constitution is a great oppor-
tunity for change and improve-
ment in Student Government here
and I think I can help in instituting
the necessary changes and im-
provements. _

.-I have been involved in Student
Government at Pitt for over‘ a‘
year. By being president of Men’s
Dormitory Council the past year
has given me the opportunity to
gain valuable experience and has
enabled me to sit in on many
other committees throughout the
University-. Some of these are Res-
ident Housing Advisory Board,‘
Men’s Council, and Student Af- 4
fairs ‘Advisory Committee.

By being on SAAC I was able to
work closely with the Constitu-
tional Review Committee in its
writing of the new Constitution.
Although I presently hold other
positions in Student Government,
they will not deter from my abil-
ity to sit on the Board because
the term of offices for them run
out next month.

CURRICULUM
GUIDE

-

by R. A. McConnell, University of Pittsburgh

Is 8. F. Skinner right? Or is there something inside the
human black box that" transcends sensory conditioning? Are
human freedom and dignity outmoded concepts as Skinner

' now declares? Or is there‘ a. rigorous, experimental basis for
neo-behaviorism is incomplete? These are
questions whose answers may come from the study of extra-
sensory perception and psychokinesis-—if, as some believe,

In his ESP Curriculum Guide, Professor McConnell does
not discuss philosophy. Instead, he shows what can be taught
in high-school and college classrooms about parapsychology
as a science without criticism or denial by scientists who
be|ieve~in the theoretical-empirical method. .

I enjoy participatin-EgEI_instudent '

government activities. As a Sena-
tor and a member of the Univer-
sity Senate Council two years ago
and as the Chairman of the Con-
stitutional Review, Committee
last term, I was exposed to a great
number of intriguing experienc-
es’. In addition, I was introduced
to a varied group of people.

Idealistically, I have defined
my role in student government.
Through the supposed prestige
of the office and the accompany-
ing personal contacts, I can help
individuals.

Admittedly, I can claim that I
will continue the services started
in previous administrations with
which I have been associated (Le-
gal Awareness, Tenants’ Union,
etc.). Yet, SG has more poten-
tial.

It is an organization which has
contacts, powers, and a purpose to
combat problems in the various
phases of college life.

Moreover, since transactions
with the faculty and the admin-
istration are necessary, I would
hope that my accrued knowledge,
association, and respect devel-
oped over the years with these

Also, SG has another role. That

V is, to represent the student body,

to serve as a watchdog over pol-

icies, whether academic social or

financial (from tenure to tuition).
We pay the bills."

We spend a large part of our
lives in this community. We de-

‘ serve to know its inner-workings

and to participate in University
decision-making.

ia (SNAP). ~

Elizabeth “Lee” Tyson is pre-
sently a student representative on
one of the nursing faculty com-
mittees, and active in the Stud-
ent Health Professions Union,
Alpha Tau Delta, "SNAP and the
track team. As a- Pitt student at
the Johnstown campus, Lee was
a member of Dorm Council and
the Newman Club. .

Terri Weaver is activities co-
ordinator of Chi Omega sorority.
Her other current activities in-
clude: working with the Admis-

sions Office in Phase I (high

school recruitment) and being a
student representative on the Un-
dergraduate Nursing Steering

~» Committee. Last term Terri was-

chairman of Lantern Night," a

wish to have establis ed in he
programming of activities and
services. Having established-
these priorities, we will design
the programs with the view of
making them conveniently avail-'
able to the maximum number of
students. In pursuit of this goal
we intend to take every step pos-
sible to -establish the following
programs:

(1) — To give the students a
voice in determining the activi-

ties programming for the upcom-'

ing year through the use of ques-
tionnaires.

(2) — To make campus organ-
izations more viable by increas-
ing student participation. SG will
provide expanded publicity for
membership recruitment in or-
ganizations. Activities of the var-
ious student groups will be made
known. In granting allocation re-
quests the number of people
involved in an organization and

the amount of service provided‘

will be taken into consideration.
Increased emphasis will be plac-
ed on the cooperative nature of
funding and self-sufficiency will
be stressed. “

(3) —- To coordinate the pro-
gram of the various student or-
ganizations in order to prevent
duplication of effort and thereby
economize the financing of these
programs.

(4) — To take into consideration
all segments of the campus when
planning‘ activities, and to sup-
port special interest program-
ming on a cooperative basis.

(_5) —To make arrangements
with the Pitt News to provide on
an ad needed basis a maximum of

would also be employed to pub-

Led by freshmen George Bry-

with two falls apiece, the Panther
matmen wrestled aggressively.
driving for pins and constantly
‘getting that-important first per-
iod takedown.

Since weigh-ins were only one.
hour before the match,,each par‘-.
ticipant received a three pound
weight allowance. ‘Pitt Head
Coach Dave‘ Adams thought this
fact definitely contributed to John

' “Bimbo” Chatman’s outstanding
ﬂ performance at 158.

I "“Bimbo’ has had problems mak-

ing 158,” related Adams. “Against
Kent State, he had to workout the
day of the match and cut weight. "
But John looked great at West

 VirginiaJ(withv a 1:40 pin and a
. 13-1 decision).” '

Upping his season“record to 11-
2-1, Bryant flattened both his foes

ard Bradshaw after the meet.
“But without Mark Wallace I did-
n’t feel we could beat them.”

Freshman Wallace, the gem of
Bradshaw’s recruiting efforts,
has beenired-shirtedifor the sea-
son. Wallace, who established two
varsity records in first meet, con-
tracted mononeculosis over

» Christmas vacation.

“We could -have stacked the 400
yard medley relay with Wallace
and easily won it,” commented
Bradshaw. “And we would have
taken first in the 200 yard back-
stroke and taken the 400 yard
freestyle relay at the end of the
meet.” ' *

Wallace set the school record‘

in the 200 back with a time of
2:03 which was two seconds bet-
ter than any Bison swimmer. In
the record breaking 400 yard free-
style relay in the Clarion meet he
swam a48 second leg; Adding all

toutskates C-MU club  

to lengthen win streak

by BART MACK

Playing shorthanded for over
16 minutes of the game. the Pitt
Hockey Club needed a strong de-
fensive effort to defeat the skat-
ers of Carnegie-Mellon Universi-
ty. 3-1. at the Alpine Ice Chalet
last Saturday.

Those 16 minutes seemed to
come in clumps during the second
and third periods. as one Pitt play-
er was whistled off after another.
At one point in the third period
C-MU held a manpower advan-
tage for five straight minutes.

However. the first period be-
longed completely to Pitt. as it
dominated all of the action. Billy
Glanville opened the scoring at
the 1:11 mark, knocking in’ the re-
bound of Kerry Browne’s shot.

The play remained in theC-MU
end during most of the period,

‘forcing the Tartans to ice the puck

several times. Dave Bahnson_ got
the second Pitt goal at 9:41 on a
pass from Glenn Hyde.

Hyde carried the puck into the
corner and. while taking‘a hard
check from a C-MU defender.
fired a perfect pass to Bahnson.
who was stationed in front of the
goal cage. Bahnson took the puck
and easily flipped it by the goalie.

Mark Lieberman was called
upon to make only four saves dur-
ing the period but one was a bril-
liant effort to stop a C-MU break-
away. Pitt kept the pressure on.
firing 13 shots on goal and led 2-0
at the end of the first frame.

The C-MU skaters picked up

second period as they stymied two
consecutive power plays. It was
then their turn to have the man
advantage as the parade of Pitt
skaters to the penalty box began.
Only strong defensive skating and
solid goaltending held C-MU off
-the §c_6reboard.

Pitt started the third period a
man short. but Frank Williams in-
tercepted a clearing pass by the
C-MU goalie (who had come 40
feet out of the net ). He fired it by
him for the third Pitt goal.

C-MU added its own shorthand-
ed goal at the 9:05 mark to spoil
Lieberman’sbid for his first shut-
out.

The pressure was not off Pitt
as the penalty box seemed ,tovat-
tract the icers. -The stream of

.-punished skaters started at 9:36

and at the 10:11 mark, C-MU
even held a two-man advantage.

But the momentum stayed with
Pitt as it continued to control the
play even though down a man. Pitt
outshot C-MU 12 to nine during the
third period and 34 to 23 through-
out the game. '

The Club is now 4-0 in league
play and 4-1 overall. Its only loss
came at the hands of Gannon Col-
lege at Erie in "exhibition. Pitt
will play its next league encoun--
ter against Penn State of McKees-

’ port on Jan. 29.

Dr

Rogers, Pribis pave
way to gymnasts’ win

by RICK ROSENTHAL

The Pitt gymnastic squad cap-
tured its first victory Saturday at
Slippery Rock, 113.85-110.90-‘as
Dick Pribis and Bob Rogers cap-
tured firsts.

Coach Neiger’s gymnasts were
plagued by injuries the week prior
to the meet, as three of the
squad‘s top performers were un-
able to compete. The three were
Joe Gracik (side horse special-
list), Christ Gardner (all-around
performer). and John Gelormini
(parallel bars). However, their
replacements were equal to the
task.

In the first event of the meet,
the floor exercise, Dick Pribis
turned in one of his usual fine per-

‘ formances, registering an 8.3. Ed

Swerdlow then turned in a 7.1 and
freshman Mark Boyett rated a
6.9 from the judges. Their com-
bined efforts enabled Pitt to take
the event by four points.

Steve Heasley of Slippery Rock
finished first in the floor exercise
with an 87.55 score but receiyed lit-
tle support from his teammates.
Ron Sopato and Dennis Sciullo
scored 6.0 and? 5.0, respectively.

The Neigermen led by Bob Rog-
ers (7.0) first place finish, took
the side/horse event 16.90-13.05.
The squad’s performance in the
side horse was poorer than usual
due to the loss of Gracik.

The Rockets took the next event,
the steel rings, 21.55-17.05, led
by Bob Wallender’s 7.5 first place
finish. John Hornick -(6.5) and
Mike Matthews (6.3) were high
scorers for the Pitt squad in that
event.

came in the vaulting. D'ick Pribis

Pitt lost the last event, the hori-

"with the performances of Camp-

who he said, “They both perform-

C ed admirably.”

Bruce content at home

by VINCE DI NARDO

When it was publicized last summer that Kirk
Bruce had decided to attend Pitt on a basketball
scholarship. the city’s sports writers referred to
the event as the signing of "one that didn’t get
away."

Bruce,'who was a star at South Hills High School.
was very much in demand in every part of the coun-
try.

Jacksonville was very much interested in him.
In the East, La Salle put in a strong bid to land him.
Michigan State wanted him in the Midwest and Stan-
ford desired his services on the West Coast.

But, Kirk knew all along where he wanted to
go, Pitt.

“I think Pitt is really moving up in basketball."

he said. “I liked the schedules it was making and I '

believed it would be ranked soon. Besides I thought
I could play for them.”

After only five games as a Cub. Bruce has al-
ready proven that he can play here. Bruce can play
either forward or guard. though he has been a for-
ward so far, and has uncanny jumping ability. When
Bruce jumps, he can extend his whole hand above
the ten foot rim. He stands at only 6-4.

So far, with a slick jump shot as his main tool,
Kirk has accumulated a 21 point average. He has
also been skying for eight rebounds a game as well
as doing his part in the pressing zone defense that
the Cubs apply. ’

For that defense, Bruce had to make some ad-
justments.

“Offensively we play a lot like I did at South
Hills,” he commented, ‘but we use a lot more de-
fense here. We’ve got to run a lot and help the other
guy and as a result I guess—I hope—I’ve been getting
better defensively and more aggressive overall."

Kirk Bruce enjoys athletics. His room in the
Towers is plastered with posters of sports heores in
the various sports. I

“I don’t have any collegiate basketball heroes.“
he said, “but in the pros,  like Oscar Robertson.“

 I Janua‘ryi-I71’: All

 

 

 

V Strangely enough his hero is one of. if not the’-
most. all around players in the sport. which is indi-”'

cative of the ideal Bruce has been aiming at.

Someday, Bruce would like to join Oscar in the _V
pro ranks, but he is in no particular hurry. Rather, - 
he questions if he will be good enough when the time ’ 2;,

COIIICS. \

"The idea sounds great. but I’ll have to wait and 
see about that. Right now. I'll be tr_ving to break in

here.“ .

Asked if his coach. Tim Grgurich. has helped him
so far, Kirk answered‘. "Hell yeah.’ -

When Bruce, who looks like he is 6-7 with

his abundant Afro, selected Pitt he was the one that
didn’t get away. 0

Jacksonville. La Salle. Michigan State. and

Stanford were the ones that let him get away.
