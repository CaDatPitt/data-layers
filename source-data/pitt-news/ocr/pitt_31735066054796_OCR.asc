Freshmen appl

Assistant News Editor
Last year’s freshman class was the

biggest in Pitt’s history, so big that the .

University quickly ran out of housing.
"Pitt administration was “pleasantly
surprised” by the last year’s number of
in—coming freshman, Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg said. .

And the number of students submit-
ting applications to study at Pitt keeps
going up. In fact, freshman applications
for the fall 1999 semester are at an all-
time high.

So far, the ofﬁce of admissions and
financial aid has received 13,480 appli-
cations, 1483 more than last year and
about 9700 more than in thefall term of
1995. Q ’
‘ “The increase in both the number
and quality of the freshman is a clear
indication of the growing recognition,
both statewide and nationally, of the
quality of the academic programs at
[Pitt],” Provost James Maher said.

To coincide with the rising number

of applications, the University has seen a .

similar increase in the academic qualiﬁ-
cations of the students applying.
SAT scores and class rank of

enrolling freshman are also at an all time

high. This fall’s incoming freshmen
boast an average SAT score of 1160, an
increase of 19 points over last year.
When it comes to class standing, 55 per-
cent of this ‘fall’s freshmen rank in the
top 20 percent of their high school class-
es, up 47 percent from last year.

This fall 601 freshmen will be-“hon-
ors—eligible” —— meaning that they
scored 1270 or above on the SAT and
ranked in the top 10_percent of their high
school classes. Last year 557 students
were “honors—eligible.”

“These are the students who are
most serious about the quality of the edu-
cation they will receive and Pitt is
attracting them in steadily increasing
numbers,” Maher said.

So many students have applied that
the University has had to cut the number
of applications it will accept. Last year,
3,157 of the almost 12,000 applicants
began their college careers at Pitt. Out of
the more than 13,000 applicants this

_ year, Pitt is accepting only 2,979.

African Americans will make up
335 of that number, 11.2 percent, up
from 9.2 percent last year.

The smaller freshman class will help
the University avoid last year’ s housing
crunch.

more accurately,” Nordenberg said.
Nordenberg added that the smaller

number of freshmen will also help Pitt

keep class sizes from getting too big.
Fu1l—time undergraduate enrollment

1 this fall will be 14,646 students. Pitt’s

overall full—time enrollment — including
graduate students and students at satel-
lite campuses — will be 27,017.
All-in-all, full-time , enrollment has
edged up by 309 students over last year. .

Parking and Transportation tried
in vain to set up a program for stu-
dents to ride Port Authority buses by

. showing their ID cards when Robert

Harkins became director five years
ago.
. “We went to the Port Authority to
see what we could do,” he said.
“[But] the cost was prohibitive.”~

So Harkins and the University

settled for a compromise: the U—zone,

a triangular area between Squirrel
Hill, Shadyside and Craft Avenue in
Oakland where students could ﬂash
their ID cards to ride the bus.

But now the U-zone is an element

of the past and Harkins’ goal has

finally been realized.

The Port Authority of Allegheny
County board of directors voted in
July to approve a 5-year, multimil-
lion-dollar plan to let Pitt students
and faculty ride buses and light rail
vehicles

The program took effect Aug. 1.

“This is clearly —a win-win situa-
tion for both Port Authority and the

University of Pittsburgh,” said Port -

Authority Executive Director Paul
Skoutelas. ‘ 3 i A

dents and faculty to use mass transit
to reach- a greater array of destina-
tions for a lower cost and Port
Authority’s expectation of increased

' ridership. '

Students no longer need to pay
fares or buy transfers but they pay for

{the service in fees added to their

tuition.

According to Port Authority, the
service will cost approximately $8.3
million over five years. Pitt adminis-
tration raised students’ security, safe-
ty and transportation fee to $55 a
semester for both full— and part-time
students and will use the money to
pay Port Authority for the service.

Previously, full-time students
paid $37 per semester and part-time
students paid $16 per semester.

University administration chose a
ﬂat fee for all students because it was
ultimately more equitable, according
to Spokesman Ken Service.

“The feeling was that both full—
and part-time students will get the
same benefit regardless of the num-
ber of courses they’re taking,” he
said.

Students have long been able to
buy discounted monthly bus passes

Oakland merchants petition
against moving Backyard Brawl

Hal Turner .

Editor in Chief

In his 18-month effort to
dust off Pitt sports, the new ath-
letic director has made several
visible changes to attract more
fans, especially to a once—ﬂoun—
dering football program.

But Pederson’s latest move
to expand the program has
come under fire from South
Oakland’s business community.

' The annual “Backyard
Brawl,” named for Pitt’s ongo-
ing bout with geographically
close Big East conference rival
West Virginia University, will
move out of Pitt’s backyard to
Three Rivers- Stadium down-
town Nov. 27,. It‘will be Pitt’s
first game there since 1982.

Pederson ﬂatly denied that
this game is part of a pilot pro-
gram to test how Panther games
work out in a downtown setting.

“This is a one-game deal,”
he said. “This isn’t a trial bal-
loon for anything.”

But the move still has much
of the South Oakland business

 

owners fuming.

“Mr. Pederson’s decision
proves that he has no idea what
Pitt Football in Oakland is all
about,” wrote Michael Hanley,
co—owner of restaurant/bar Fuel
& Fuddle, in a petition sent to
Pitt Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg on Aug. 13, asking
him to reverse Pederson’s deci-
sion.

It took about three hours '

over three days for Hanley to
get 45 signatures of South
Oakland merchants, he said.
But more than 45 business-
es operate in South Oakland,
including Schlotzsky’s Deli,

‘ owned by Dave Carl, who isn’t

upset by Pederson’s strategy.
“There’s two sides to every
story no matter how you skin
it,” Carl said. “I’m not signing
until knowing both sides.” _
Hanley approached Carl for
his signature, but when Carl
refused and asked Hanley Pitt’s,
reason for moving the game,
Hanley wasn’t sure, Carl said. '
Carl said he wanted to talk

to Pederson first because he ‘

And Carl knows — a healthy

Besides, Carl added, the

students are out of Oakland on ’

Thanksgiving vacation that
weekend and fan traffic would
be minimum.

But Hanley compares the
one-game move to unethical
bartenders. Relocating down-
town to attract Black Friday
shoppers and Steelers fans who
dread the Oakland traffic night-
mare equates to a bartender
serving "underage patrons to

make a few bucks; sure, there ‘

are short-terrn ‘benefits, but at
what moral cost?

Hanley argues students will , if

- Pitt-Bradford psychology professor
acknowledged “a grave error in
'udgement” after offering students

extra credit if they bought her recently pub-
lished book, one not required for class.
Kimberly Young, assistant professor of

   
 

psychology at The University of Pittsburgh-

Bradford campus, received national atten-
tion ﬁom such outlets as Newsweek, USA
Today and ABC’s World News Tonight
after publishing “Caught in the Net” which
deals with Internet addiction.

Students in Young’s classes said she

"offered them 10 points to be added to their

Young recanted her offer and and said
she had received some bad advise. ,

“lmadeabaderrorwhiletiyingtodo
something beneﬁcial for my students,” she
said .“I know I am an ethical person and I
feel like I tried to handle it in the best way
possible.”

'tt trustees approved nearly $27 mil-
"on of campus improvements, includ-
ing $1.4 million for convocation cen-
’ ter blueprints and $5.3 million for a new res-
idence hall.

The new housing will be garden-style
apartments to accommodate 204 students,
and Pitt is aiming to have them open by fall

Oakland residents later protested the
building of the new dorms saying they will
block out the sun in South Oakland

This is the ﬁrst step in the University’s
10-year facilities plan that promises to pro-

Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg said
he doesn’t think Oakland will become a big
construction site when work starts because
many of the improvements will occur
indoors.

 

'tt’s Delta Delta Delta Sorority chapter

was slapped with a temporary suspen-

sion for throwing a party where a
teenage pledge allegedly got drunk and left
with her teenage date. She accused him of
sexually assaulting her later in his dormito-
ry room. _

The incident occurred on April 17, but
didn’t come into media spotlight until.
Pittsburgh Judge Daniel Butler sent a letter
to Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg calling
for the sorority’s decertiﬁcation. He said he
was shocked by the testimony of an 18-
year-old woman who said she had full
access to beer and booze at a Tri-Delta “date

-party-”

The woman and her date, Pitt student
Jonathan Wairick, were allegedly served at
Loafers, a restaurant and bar downtown.

Warrick, of Moscow, Pa. was later
charged with sexual assault.

Tri—Delta remains suspended indeﬁ-
nitely pending Pitt’s investigation of the
incident. 4

Contributing Editor

Incoming students from rural
Pennsylvania may feel alien to the rat-
race atmosphere of college life in
Pittsburgh, but students from other
countries have double the problems,
especially when English is their second
language. _

This fall, 57 international students

H‘ have been accepted and have been

issued the necessary visas.

, The University of Pittsburgh’s
Office of International Services (OIS)
helps by giving advice to international
students regarding American college
life, immigration issues —— especially

since there are 48 different visa classiﬁ-
cations — and important information
on living in the U.S.

“We’re here as a general resource
to assist foreign students with whatever
they bring to our attention,” said
Geoffrey Wood, director of
International Services. “We’re not
(always) the ﬁnal solution, but we can
show them where to take it.”

During OIS’s International Student
Orientation, sessions on banking, hous-
ing,‘ immigration issues, health insur-
ance, the U.S. educational system, and
Pitt services are held.

One of the major concerns for inter-
national students is the issuing of visas,
Wood said. OIS helps students negoti-

ate the jungle of letters and numbers
that make up the F-1, J-1, I-20, IAP-66
and I-94 visas — not to mention numer-
ous others if the student is bringing over
spouses, ﬁances or children.

“We are a repository of information
on the U.S. Information Agency,
Internal Revenue Service, Department
of State, ‘ Immigration and
Naturalization Services, - and the
Department of Labor,” said Wood.

OIS functions are broken down into
two areas: admissions and advising.

The admissions ofﬁce evaluates the
credits international students earned
before coming to Pitt, and enters them
into the program to which the prospec-
tive international students have applied.

Directors of those programs are then
able to discern between the intemation-
al applicant and his or_ her American
counterpart.

The advising section is available
for general assistance to international
students. .

There is, however, a limit as to how
much OIS can do to help.

“In an extreme case, such as a stu-
dent receiving a deportation order, we
won’t act in a legal capacity,” Wood

- said. “But we will recommend an immi-

gration attorney. There are professional
limitations.” '

A “We also work with student organi-
zations based on religion, where they
come from, language, and culture,”
Wood said.

Organizations such as the
International Student Fellowship (ISF),
Muslim Student Association, Asian
Studies Club, the African Student
Organization, as well as ethnic and
nationality student groups, provide an
atmosphere where overseas students
can get together and socialize.

“We’re hereto help and assist for-
eign students. We have meetings on the
first Friday of each month in Parran
Hall to provide a friendly atmosphere
for international students,” said Terry
Tiberio, ISF assistant director. “We help
provide a home away from home.”

tion.

The first year of the service is,
however, a trial period. Pitt and Port
Authority administrators will study
how well the service functions to
decide whether to continue it. If, for
instance, not enough students take
advantage of the service to justify the
cost, Pitt could discontinue it for the
remaining four years.’ The contract
can be renegotiated every year at the
request of either party.

While the U-zone was a conve-
nience, Harkins said it didn’t always
extend far enough to meet every stu-
dent’s needs. Parking and
Transportation received telephone
calls and e—mails requesting that the
U-zone be expanded one block here
and another block there, he said.

Pitt couldn’t honor every request,
Harkins said, so to be fair the
University resumed talks with Port
Authority about a county-wide pro-
gram. <

‘The’ new service will have no
impact on present University shuttle
bus routes, which students and facul-
ty can also ride by showing their ID
cards.

Harkins applauded approval of
the service and its benefits.

“In effect, it expands our campus
through the entire county,” he said.

PETITION

Thanksgiving can attract more ticket-
buyers with a change of venue.

“I don’t care if you play it on the
Parkway East, you’re not going to get
more (fans),” Hanley said. Pitt’s last
day-after—Thanksgiving home game
was in 1996, and the attendance was
21,772. The attendance at other games
in Pitt Stadium that year ranged from as
high as 54,612 to no lower than 24,374.

Hanley and Carl agreed this is the
best game to move downtown in terms
of lost Oakland business. Both thought
moving the Penn State game Sept. 19
would be devastating. '

and Panther memorabilia vendor, has to

“I would like to see CBS show the

ness. They have to do what’s best,”
Bonasorte added. Bonasorte said he’d
like to see the game played in Oakland
for the students’ convenience, to bolster
student pride and for the business com-
munity’s sake.

But Pederson said this move is def-
initely what’s optimum for Pitt expan-

horrible to those who see it that way.

Exposure to more potential corpo-
rate sponsors is a downtown possibility,
too, Pederson said. Corporate and luxu-

pitch, Carl noted.

Pederson said he fully expects

new things,” Pederson said. “We’re
going to make it fun.”

Cathedral of

Learning

The Cathedral of Learning soars 42
stories over’ Pitt’s Oakland campus, high
enough to claim the title of tallest acade—I
mic building in the Western ’
Hemisphere.

‘But the Cathedral has lots of com-
pany. Oak1and’s 13l—acre campus is
bursting with 56 buildings, many of
which —— like Heinz Chapel, William
Pitt Union and Pennsylvania Hall ‘—
have unique architecture or compelling
histories. '

John Bowman, chancellor from 1921
to 1945, had the original inspiration for
the Cathedral of Learning. He made
grand plans for the “tall building,” as the
Cathedral was initially known, envision-
ing a 52—story ediﬁce surrounded by a
cluster of smaller buildings.

Financier Andrew Mellon bought 14
acres of land and donated it to Pitt.
Various local corporations donated steel,
cement, glass, plumbing and ' heating
materials. Some 17,000 city residents
gave money as did 97,000 local school
children, each of whom donated 10 cents
to “buy a brick” of the Cathedral.

Building the Cathedral of Learning
posed problems from the start. Funding
was scarce despite the donations; the pro-
ject ran out of money halfway through
construction and was delayed for 6 years.

I ' Some residents worried that without any

surrounding skyscrapers to shield the

— Cathedral, it might topple in a stiff wind.

But construction commenced, and
work was completed June 4, 1937,
almost 11 years after workers dug the
foundation Sept. 27, 1926.

‘The result was a 42—story structure
that stood without any of the surrounding
buildings Bowman had originally

planned.

The class of 1937 donated a hollow
comerstone to finish, the ﬂoor of the
expansive Commons Room. Inside the
stone, Pitt dignitaries‘ buried a sort of
time capsule containing papers bearing
the signatures of the graduating students,
the names of the men who built the
Cathedral, photographs of the construc-
tion and a copy of the The Pitt News.

The 535-foot high Cathedral is nine
million cubic feet in volume. It is expect-
ed to be structurally sound for 500 years.

athedral of Learning coo a th ti flor ad head up.

Note the base is unfinished in this photo. -

William Pitt Union

Right across the street from the
Cathedral is the William Pitt Union, which
will turn 100 years old this fall. ‘

Originally the Schenley Hotel, the
building has a glamorous past. Opera
singer Enrico Caruso once rented an entire
ﬂoor. Presidents Woodrow Wilson,
Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard
Taft dined there. In 1942, Spencer Tracy
visited Katherine Hepburn while she was a
guest at the hotel. »

_The University paid $1.8 million for
the building in August of 1957, renamed it
Schenley. Hall and immediately remodeled

g the interior to accommodate student activ-

ities. The 6th through 9th ﬂoors were ren-
ovated into dormitory rooms, which held
204 men.

On September 24, 1959 the Soviet
leader Nikita Khrushchev and his family
came to Pitt for a luncheon in Schenley
Hall’s Venetian Room. Khrushchev, who
was on an 11-day American tour before
visiting Washington for talks with
President Eisenhower, was accompanied
by four ambassadors and 325 news corre-
spondents, all of whom arrived in
Pittsburgh _on three Air Force jets.

Every police ofﬁcer in the city was on
duty. Students and faculty were told not to

Govemor David Lawrence, Mayor
Thomas Gallagher and Chancellor Edward
Litchﬁeld presided over the luncheon,
which included speeches by all three lead-
ers and by Khrushchev himself.
Newspapers from The Pittsburgh Press to
The New York Times covered the event..

Heinz Chapel.

University trustee Henry Heinz,
founder of the HJ. Heinz company, origi-
nally conceived the idea for a nonsectarian
chapel to be built on the Cathedral campus.

When he died in 1909, he left

  
 
  

 

$100,000 in his will for the University to
build the chapel; his children increased that
amount to $570,000. They later made an
additional allotment of $50,000 to pur-
chase an organ.

Construction of the chapel, named for
Henry and his mother Margaretha Smith
Heinz, began in August of 1933. The cost

of the project soared to $1 million,-»

$200,0()0 of which was used to buy 23
stained glass windows. Heinz Chapel was
ﬁnished m 1938, with the spire in the cen-
ter of the chapel rising to. 17 stories.

Schenley Quad

The ‘ residence halls that comprise
Schenley Quad were originally the Schenley
Apartments, built in 1924 for approximately
$4.5 million. The University sold bonds and
raised tuition in 1955 when it purchased the
complex for $3 million.

Pitt’s acquisition of the buildings raised ’

the apartment residents’ ire; ﬂrey were angry
because Pitt notiﬁed them of the evictions
duringwhatwas supposedtobeamerry
Christmas week of 1955. . V

At a cost of $1 million, Pitt converted
the 238 apartments into dorms, which were
ready to receive students at the beginning of

the 1957-1958 school year.

Brackenridge Hall housed 101 female
students whom the University kept on a
shortleash.Allthewomenhadtobeintheir
rooms by 8:30 pm. on weekdays, and
sophomore, jrmior and senior women were
allowed to stay out until 12:30 am. — once
a week Male students living -in nearby
dorms were subject to no such regulation.

Pennsylvania Hall

Construction of Pennsylvania Hall
began in 1910 as part of an ambitious plan
to erect 30 new buildings on campus —— a
plan that ultimately fell well short of its
goal, as only ﬁve were ever built

Pitt initially used Pemrsylvania Hall as
the medical school. The building quickly
fell out of favor, however, because it was in

  

poor physical condition — a leaky roofs

made studying inside the building a soggy
proposition —g and because. itwas not‘cen-
traltoahbspital. T ' * ‘ ‘
Today Pennsylvania Hall is largely
vacant; it continues to fall into disrepair.
The University plans to demolish the
building to construct a parking lot and ten-
nis courts. 
That plan has drawn sharp criticism
from 3 some community members who
insist Pemrsylvania Hall could be convert-
ed for student housing. Pitt disagrees, say-
ing the buﬂding’s age, physical condition
and interior designate
not conducive to such
a use. Community
activists have peti-
tioned the city plan-
ning commission to
block Pitt’s plans on

Some stuff left out of Pitt's? brochures

Freshmen, may I be of the ﬁrsts to welcome
you to this ever-diverse campus we so lovingly
call the University of Pittsburgh.

Obviously, by the size of your ﬁeshman
class, Pitt has done a dandy of a job ushering
you into Oakland Such a bizarre location for a
college campus, eh?

The task before me is to welcome you. A
personal hope in my welcoming you, is that it
rivals the subtle levels of discourse that Pitt_’s
recruiting wizards have sent you all summer
long. The signiﬁcant dilference in my welcome
is the degree of subtlety.

In standard bohemian fashion I reﬁise to
waste ink on “how fantastic Pitt is during the
foliage days,” or “the convenience of having a

campus where you can get to everything on foot .

or by bus!” _ .
. Fuck the insipid conventions of a brochure
manual; they never tell you what areas to stay

clear of at night anyhow. (The H-Rule: avoid all

areas that begin with the letter H
at night, i.e., Hazelwood, K EV | N
Homestead, Homewood and the
Hill District.) ‘

My missive will begin with a
creed that you must live by: any-
thing written by the University is a falsehood,
anything heard at parties is a lie, anything told to
a friend is misunderstood, ajump ﬁom the top
ofthe Cathedralis the ultimate demise. Ifyou
abidebythatcreed,yourstintatPittwillbenoth-
ing more than a few laughs.

Now, I’d like to speak of two spots where

r you will -be most likely to witness a homicide.

The ﬁrst, and more obvious location, is the
Original Hot Dog Shop. The “O” is ahappening
scene where patrons can be caught sinking their
teeth into peculiar substances that contain high
enough levels of grease to keep all of NASCAR
lubed _

The “O”is infact unique. Itis theonly place
in Oaldand where you can get a hot dog, an
orderofﬁies, a40ouncebeer, andamild assault
for just under $20! I have never been able to ﬁg-
me out why it is such a hot locality, butpthen
again, I’ve never hung out there long enough.
And the reason why?

’ Itseemsthatatleastonceamonththereis
some type of altercation that goes down on the
comer of Forbes Avenue and Bouquet Street
The agitation behind such ruckus could possibly
be the extreme weather changes that we endure

' throughout the year in Pittsburgh A more logi-

cal explanation could be that the police allow for
an overabundance of patrons to test the concrete

COLUMNIST

foundation of that intersection there.

The other location to view a homicide
would have to be the Financial Aid olﬁce. I
don’t know if it’s just me, but there is something
about those people that test every. ounce of san-
ity the gene-pool had to give.

The average employee at the ﬁnancial aid
ofﬁce comes across as sweet and considerate.
Two very ﬁne characteristics to possess —— it’s
just a damn shame that neither compensates for
their lack of competence. The succinct way of
describing the Financial Aid ofﬁce is that it epit-

. omizes the sheer simplicity and eﬁiciency of

bureaucracy. (Their little bureau controls my
college education, so I’m actually a little timid to
disclose the way I really feel.)
The Financial Aid oﬂice is the only oﬂice
oncampusthatyoucan: a)goto,presentingto
them a letter that is printed on University letter-
head, from their department, b) explain how the
letter includes a message ﬁorn one of their
employees, c) ask for an explanation
about the letter, and d) be told that,

emment, your best bet would be to get
in touch with them.”

So you’re left standing there thinking
to yourself, “is this person brain-dead, or is the
systemso smoothly operatedthatthisis standard
procedme?” As your patience exhausts, and
your blood pressure rises, you ﬁnd yourself in a
very bent position. Yes, you could become irate
andswearandscream,butthenyouhavetoreal-
ize that they have your social security number,
whichintummeans thatthey couldtamperwith
a number or two, totally ruining your chances of
any aid whatsoever. ‘ ‘

The frightening element: of this systematic
glitchthatlﬁndtobegenuinelytrueisthatthese
people fail to realize how much students rely on
ﬁnancial supporttopursuetheirdegrees. Ireally
don’t think they get it! A

That alone infiniates me enough to attain
postal madness. Thus, I’m conﬁdent in saying
thatthishasnotonly happenedtomeforthepast
two years.There are others out there, and I’m
calling on all of you to rally behind me on this.
We can start a support group.

In closing, I’d suggest enjoying your stay at
Pitt, and take advantage of anything that comes
your way!

Kevin Carey believes that if you fall down
steps in an altered stupor and are prescribed
narcoticsfor the pain, then by all means suck it
up and save the pills for a rainy day.

Welcome to Hell.

Ha ha. Seriously, welcome to
Pittsburgh.

For those of you who like this sort of
thing, here's some raw statistical data:

Population: 358,883 (1997). Size: 55.5
sq. miles. Altitude: 1,240 ft. (high point), 715
ft. (low point). City rank (population): 46th
in the nation. Location: right smack in the
middle of nowhere.

Of course, the above tidbits of infonr1a—
tion are the tip of the iceberg. There is much
more to a city than population rank and ele-
vation and per capita personal income
(which is $21,175, by the way). Personally, I
think that a city like Pittsburgh can be

THE Prrr Nraws: OPINIONS SI=.crIoN

described in an overly generalized, some-
what limited metaphor, and between you
and me, that’s what I do best.

Imagine, if you will, a city ﬁlled with
people who built their homes on the side of
what could only be called’ a “bowl.” Stay
with me for a moment. Then imagine that
these same people are waiting for a monsoon
or a strong wind to scrape their houses off the
side of the bowl like a spatula in cake batter
and throw them into the mighty
Monongohela.

, Contrary to what this metaphor seems
to indicate, Pittsburghers are not overly sui-
cidal. However, the transplants from other
parts of the country (such as those who
attend Pitt) have noticed some elements of
life here, such as weather, do not exactly say
“Venice Beach,” or even “Fargo, ND.”

The most common weather pattern I
have observed is overcast, with an occasion-
al chance of rain. In fact, Pittsburgh is over-
cast more days in a year than Seattle — it just
doesn’t rain as much The unlikely chance
thatahurricanewillhitPittsburghisequalto
the chance that Pittsburgh will see sustained
sunshine for more than an hour at a time.

. You might be asking yourselves why
this columnist is spending so much time
describing everything that has to do with
Pittsburgh but the University of Pittsburgh
itself.

The simple answer is that you new stu-
dents, you freshly minted, ignorant freshmen
and transfer students should quite simply
know what you’re getting into. When I
arrived in January of this year as a transfer
student, no one ever told Pitt’s version of

“the facts of life.”

I was then stuck in the dead of winter
trying to ﬁgure out why the weather -had
multiple personalities; why Iron City Beer
tastes like beechwood-aged aluminum cans;
why the natives say “yinz”; why the USX
building looks like the black monolith from
2001: A Space Odyssey; etc. etc. So if it
sounds like I understand your confusion, feel
conﬁdent that I do. Mostly because I am still
conﬁrsed myself.

It all comes down to quality of life
issues and what I can tell you to prepare you
for what Pittsburgh is. Mr. Rogers lives here.
The Steelers, Penguins, and Pirates play their
respective sports here. Steel was — and to a
limited degree, still is — manufactured here.
Andy Warhol was born here and graduated
from what is now Carnegie-Mellon
University, but he left to go to New York
(Which is also a very telling sign).

But perhaps it is “not what is here, but
how you use what’s here” that counts the
most. So along with the usual collection of

_. what your parents shipped you olf with
(paper clips, staplers, phone cards, prophy-

lactics), here’s my list of things you will need
to put your best foot forward:

A good street map: This cannot be
emphasized enough. Because of the terrain,
streets are not laid out in a normal -perpen-
dicular fashion. Roads coalesce and disap-
pear when people sneeze. More highways

run through Pittsburgh than in the entire state ;
of Utah. And Jimmy Hoffa is rumored not to
be dead,.but only stuck in traﬂic at the Fort I

Pitt tunnel. ’

A good set of legs: Start small. Walk a
few blocks from your dorm or apartment the
ﬁrst few days, then branch out. You’ll soon

cuisine department. You might not have ever
had sauerkraut or a “Wedgie” before, but it’s
surprising how good food products named
after the action of yanking underwear over
the head can be. , -

However, this sense of adventure does

not apply to living dangerously with the

city’s inhabitants, or playing chicken with.

PAT buses. IfI was limited to one piece of

information, it would be to look both ways
before you cross a street. Very childish, but it
would be shocking for you to know how
many ﬁeshmen have “bit it” in this fashion.
‘And ﬁnally, a sense of humor: When the
street people on Forbes Avenue ask you for
change, smile. If the textbook you need for

And when the Campus Socialists ask
you to attend a rally, pause a brief second,

Heather Barnett

Columnist

This is a time of discovery for you
freshmen. New ﬁelds of study, a new
rigor of thought, a community of ideas
await you. All are yours to discover and
wonder at. So take some pearls of wis-
dom from me, someone who has ﬁgured
out how to get paid for being a smartass.

One thing you may be wondering:
“What the hell is that smell coming from
the end of the hall in my dorm?” The
answer is, weed. You may note the same
odor as you walk past the Beehive on
Friday night, or any other night, come to
think of it.

The upperclassman who makes you

play humiliating little “get acquainted”
games your first night in the dorm is-

called your RA, or -resident adviser. His
or her job is to ignore the marijuana
stench, while busting you for the beer
poster and unlit candle in your room. Pitt
has a housing shortage, so it has to do
everything in its power to keep you from
having any desire whatsoever to live on
campus again next year. *

The same rationale applies to cafete-
ria food. The goal is monotony, heavi-

ness, greasiness, costliness. ‘Now, I.

“only” had to live on campus food for
one year. At that time, our “caterer”bwas
Marriott. Well, they sucked. So they got
ﬁred, and a replacement outﬁt called
Sodexho took over. I am told there was
at least marginal improvement.

Then — here’s the kicker -4 MAR-
RIOTT MERGED WITH SODEXHO.
Clearly, it appeared to be nothing more
or less than an extremely expensive
revenge tactic.

You get used to the grand farce of a
huge bureaucracy very quickly. Either
that, or you transfer to some associates’
degree mill with a name like “Deer
Flatus Creek Community College and
Acrylic Nail'Styling House,” where the
main recreational activities involve live-
stock and/or cheap booze. '

Speaking of cheap booze, ‘allow me
to catch you up on the Student
Government Board of 1997/8, memo-
rable both as a source of both real, live,
even—the-Post-Gazette—covered-it .cor-
ruption and_endless cheap shot one—lin—
ers in crappy columns such‘ as this one.

What happened was... .

God, I wouldn’t believe this if I had-
n’t been here. Just be assured that, in the
words of the great Dave Barry, I am not
making this up.

It all started way back in the summer
of ‘97, when the SGB ﬁled an “emer-
gency request” for funding to go to a

‘leadership retreat. (That should have

been a tipoff right there, because nobody
ever had to go to an emergency leader-
ship retreat.) Nobody knows what
important matters were discussed over
those days at Seven Springs Mountain
Resort, but we do know tliat, while they

were perfectly happy to ditch large wads

_ of student activity money on their vaca-
.tio—— retreat, when it came time to pay

for their own slosh, they went for the
Natty Ice.

How do I know this, you ask, in awe
of my omniscience? Second sight?
Precognition? Remote viewing?

Umm, well... they sort of took a pic-
ture. Which went on to be printed in this
ﬁne paper. Which kept us humble scribes
supplied with the aforementioned cheap
shot one-liners for the better part of a
year.

Yes, the SGB was in a downward
spiral. Even George Stephanopoulos
couldn’t have corrected their spin.
Perhaps assessing the unwinnability of

the PR war, Board member Christa
Douaihy had this to say when asked for
comment by The Pitt News:

“Screw them all.”

Well, that just about summed up that
particular SGB’s philosophy. After that
shining moment in the - sun, the
Allocations Committee Chairman
Gerald Klayman was busted for embez-
zling several thousand dollars from the
student activity fund. (Just be advised
that if you were interested in joining the
University Darting Club, you may have
a little bit of trouble finding the presi-
dent. Ditto on the Boxing Club, the
Automobile Lovers Club and the
Captain’s_Crew Club.)

Then we had an SGB election in

which architectural details became very
serious campaign issues, various campus
leaders accused others of being “mon-
sters,” and stuff got set on ﬁre a lot.
Our new SGB is a lot quieter,

though. A LOT quieter, seeing as the '

main recreational activity of President
Alyson Wallach is to avoid. reporters for
weeksat a time. (Personally, I think she’s
hiding out with Waldo.)

'I‘hat’s what happened last year, at
least the entertaining parts. You can now
enjoy the inside jokes in the Opinions
section just like an upperclassman.
Consider it my gift from me to you.

Heather Barnett shall henceforth be
known as “Ymzer Spice. ”

Schaible

By the time you reach this humble arti-
cle, the words “Freshman orientation” have
been ringing in your ears as well as jumping
oil’ the pages of nearly every brochure, ban-
ner, and poster on campus.

, However, there’s a lot to be said for the
fact that a signiﬁcant percentage of new stu-
dents at Pitt this year aren’t freshmen. You
may be transfer students, like I was, or grad-
uate students. Some of you may even be
returning undergraduates that spent the pre-
vious year or two at Pitt in such a dazed stu-
por that carnpus might as well be a grand
new adventure for you to explore as well.

But, by all means, don’t fall into the trap

  

Satisfy your wand

that so many of my ﬁrst-year counterparts
last year fell into: limiting your University
experience to the cozy conﬁnes between
Bigelow Boulevard and Bouquet Street
The routine should be familiar by now:
wake up in the Towers ten minutes before
class starts, go to a class or two, grab lunch
at Eddie’s, head back to class, do homework

if you feel like it, ‘grab dinner, play Nintendo ,

or watch TV, then hit the sack This is lame!
Stop it! Get out and do something!

One of things being relentlessly beaten
into the heads of not only all Pitt students, but
faculty and staff as well, is that Port
Authority is giving fare-free rides to anyone
with a Pitt ID. Call me crazy, but I actually

like going on a bus and seeing where it goes,
never having been on its particular route

 

before. _ .

Afunbus totIythiswithistheleg—
endary 54C. This is actually a bus that takes
you PLACES. Head north out of Oakland
and you pass through the quaint neighbor-
hood of Bloomﬁeld, where $1.25 second-
11111 movie theaters, 24-hour diners featuring
“home cooking,” and dusty, cramped news-
stands predominate. Then you head down
Main Street (yes, Pittsburgh’s Main Street is
a narrow lane in Bloomﬁeld) to the wonders
of the Strip District. The Port Authority route
map shows an apple and a ﬁsh next to
Liberty Avenue. This is only a small sam-
pling of the amazing variety" of goods one
can purchase along Liberty Ave. The 54C
eventually winds up across_ tl_1e Allegheny

Ifyou take the 54C south from Oakland,
you will eventually wind up on,. yes, the
South Side, inall its bar—, thrift—store— and
specialty-store glory. It eventually progress-
es into the South Hills. ’ ‘

. However, when venturing into the -

South Hills, I prefer to take the elusive 44U.

On this -bus, you may encounter your '

English professor riding home to her quiet
home in Mount Lebanon if her Volvo’s in the
shop.

The ‘main reason most people ride the
bus to begin with is that they don’t have
access to a car. VV1th a car, you can explore
_all the hidden crevices of the city that Port
Authority buses never reach. You’ll be
amazed at how quickly the urban landscape
turns into wilderness, even. within what are
regarded as the “city limits.” This approach
to exploring Pittsburgh also has the added
beneﬁt of allowing you‘ to reach places that
do not actually require you to spend money
to have a good time. Frick Park is a forest
that creeps up the eastern limits of the city,
culminating in wide meadows and basket-
ball courts next to its Squirrel Hill entrance.

Once you have access to a car, howev-
er, the allure of the many attractions in
Pittsburgh may not be enough to satisfy your
Wanderlust.

This brings about the ultimate expres-
sion of college-age freedom: the road trip. I
suggest you take road trips early and often,
whether you have resources or not. Road

trips are also ideal for the Pit student who ,

has called the area home for most of his or
her life. ‘

_ The ideal road trip target is, welL anoth-
er college. There’s the hip, bohemian appeal
of Ohio University to the west, the controlled
anarchy of our backyard cousins in
Morgantown to the south, and IUP to the
east. I like IUP, with tennis courts, bars, and
state game ranges all within ﬁve miles of one
another, there’s something for everyone, or
in my case, everything for someone.

The ﬁnal road trip option is a journey to
the frozen north. Cleveland is just over two
hours away, Canada about four, and seclud-
ed spots in the Allegheny Forest even’ closer.
Take that special someone to a bed and
breakfast in Cook Forest State Park near
Clarion. The feds’ll never ﬁnd you there.
While you’re there, take a trip east to the
“city” of St. Mary’s (pop. 5,000). You won’t
uncover the fountain of youth, but you might
ﬁnd the “Eternal Tap” if you’re lucky.

The one thing you need to keep in the

‘back of your mind during all this‘ is to

remember that there are plenty of fun, ﬁne
diversions in Oakland itself. By adding a lit-
tle spice to your life with healthy, regular
trips away from campus, Oakland will seem
vital, interesting, and amusing for many long
weeks after orientation It might even seem
like home. Just remember where to ﬁnd the
“home cooking,” though.

Toasting Ihe folly olyouih

Dave Madden

Columnist

This here column will probably be
read by many as “old hate” and evoke the
hip phrase of the ‘90s: “Been there, done
that.” If such a response comes and this col-
umn annoys and/or bores you, then stop
reading. This here column isn’t for you.

Anyway, to the point. I’ve turned 20
and it’s a lot more important to me than my
other birthdays have been. Yes, 16 meant I
could drive, and 18 meant I could own’ the
world. This 20, though, means a whole lot
of bad things are now on deck to happen;
bad things I’ve been trying to ignore for
several years now.

Of course, there’s the obvious fact that
I’m no longer a teenager; this doesn’t both-
er me much. Yes, the teenage years were
ﬁne and dandy, but, knowing what I like to
think I know about teenagers nowadays,
I’m quite eager to be a part of this cool 20-

_ something club I see so much on the TV.

The 20—something -club may not be the
ones in the news every day, but we all
know that they’re the ones everyone pays
the most attention to. I think I’m ready to
get some attention. _

The twenty—something club, I’ve come
to realize, pays bills — a lot more bills than
teenagers. Not everyone of course, as some
“club-goers” still get money from their
folks. I, on the other hand, have this stupid
notion that I don’t want my parents’ help,
that I can do this on my own. Oh yeah, the
20—sometl1ing ‘club seems to like its inde-
pendence. .

In actuality though, the idea of bills
and running out of money and not being
able to buy what I want to buy when I want
to buy it is here and now and scary. This
past summer was my ﬁrst time living away
from my folks without University regula-
tions (and wonderfully convenient cleaning
services and food plans), and I’m slowly
having to deal with the weight of my won
personal world being on my own personal
shoulders. I get by every day knowing that
if I can’t get through this, I can in fact (like
I’ve been planning to ever since my failed
attempt when I turned 18) conquer the
world at age 21.

Pending debts aside, the 20—something
club is the club that gets married. Granted,
my folks got married during their member-
ship in the 30-something club, but that was

back in the ‘70s and you and I both know ,

how times have changed since then (I
mean, they only dated for three months or
so before getting engaged How crazy is
that?). For the most part, people many
while in the 20—something club, like my
friend from down home recently did.
Sounds lovely, but what it really means is
that young Dave Madden has friends who
are getting married This in turn can only
naturally cause the said friends to ask me
and themselves, “When’s Dave going to
get married?” So now, due to my newfound
membership in this all-encompassing club,
IhavetostartthinkingaboLtmauiage—

maybe not seriously, but somewhat. This,
in turn, means that I should start having
somewhat-serious relationships with the
ladies, which maybe isn’t that bad at all 

Of course, none of this is self-irnposed.
There just exists within today’s media-dri-
ven society by which I am so. genuinely
fascinated an idea of the 20—something
club, And I, as a newfound member, feel
the need to live up to the world’s expecta-
tions of me. It’s deﬁnitely a new feel-
ing of responsibility. I’ve never really cared
about societal expectations before, but I’m
20 now. The number itself carries an awful
lot of weight

Hours spent lying awake at night have
driven me to come up with two options: 1)
Fmther develop the Peter Pan complex I

have seen festering in what I believe is
called my “psyche,” or 2) Accept my age,
but deny society’s expectations while still
holding on to my maturity. To me, though,
these both seem connected as an attempt to
run away from the 20—something club, and
that doesn’t seem to be an option.

Again, to the point of this seemingly
premature apologia, the 20—something club
can be a scary place. However, I’ve just
now become a member, and you really
don’t see 20-year—olds across the country
committing suicide, so it can’t be that
scary. While I have my independence from
my folks down home, I haven’t been
excommunicated from their church of “I
just love giving my son ‘whatever he
needs.”

I assume, therefore, that my folks are
here to get me through this pothole I’ve got
myself stuck in. I can always solicit the
help of my friends who have been 20 for
quite some time, who, like many readers
out there, are probably laughing at the con-
fused writings of a “club newbie.”

I’ll just sit here at my computer in the
neighborhood of a city not at all threaten-
ing, patiently awaiting my share of the wis-
dom. Until then, here’s to the folly of
youth.

LaRouche’s neo-Nazi ideology more than the ramblings of a kook

John Lacny

columnlst .

Every Saturday morning on the
Oakland campus, a strange thing hap-
pens: almost magically, stacks of a news-
paper called The New Federalist, accom-
panied by other related forms of propa-
ganda, appear in huge quantities at strate-
gic localities frequented by students.
Many pick them up in passing curiosity;
few realize that they are publications of a
network run by America’s most danger-
ous neo—Nazi: Lyndon LaRouche.

The LaRouchites are not immediate-
ly recognizable as a fascist sect, especial-
ly since they like to turn the tables on
their political opponents by referring to
their enemies as “Nazis.” Nevertheless,
as LaRouche himself has stated: “It is not
necessary to wear brown shirts to be a
fascist It is not necessary to wear a
swastika to be a fascist  It is not neces-
sary to call oneself a fascist to be a fascist.
It is simply necessary to be one!”

LaRouche’s political odyssey is a tor-
tured one, but one not unlike that of old-
time fascists, including Benito Mussolini.
LaRouche started out on the far left as
part of the Trotskyite milieu, and then as
a sort of guru to a small faction of stu-
dents during the legendary rebellion at
Columbia University in 1968. .

However, LaRouche’s organization
always had many of the attributes of a
cult, with its leader exerting a hypnotic

inﬂuence over his followers through
sophisticated brainwashing techniques.
LaRouche ﬁrst tested the loyalty of his
cadres in 1973, when he ordered the infa-
mous “Operation Mop-Up.” LaRouchites
used lead pipes, chains, and clubs to
physically. assault members of the
Communist Party_ and the Socialist
Workers Party. It was shortly after this
that the LaRouche organization took a
sharp turn to the right. LaRouche devel-
oped and instilled in his followers a con-
spiratorial worldview of incredibly para-
noid proportions.

While the LaRouchites proclaim
their “anti-Zionism,” make no mistake
about it: they do so not out of any princi-
pled opposition to Israeli policies, but out
of plain old-fashioned anti-Semitism.
LaRouchite propaganda is often designed

to conceal this; many simply dismiss

LaRouche’s statements as the unconnect-
ed ramblings of a kook. But in fact, they
represent a purposeful, coherent fascist
ideology.

Those who pick up a copy of The
New Federalist may be bewildered by the
LaRouchites’ apparent belief in a world-
wide conspiracy directed by the Queen of
England. However, such allegations have
been a mainstay of anti-Semitic propa-
ganda for decades. Some of LaRouche’s
most obscure writings have spelled this
out: he places the house of Rothschild (an
ancient Jewish banking house and a long-
time target of anti-Semites) at the head of

helping others.

a worldwide conspiracy centered in
London.

So when The New Federalist fumes
about the latest action of the “London oli-
garchy” or the “British,” all of these are
coded references to the Jews. The
LaRouchites’ anti-Semitic code is one
that is read easily by their fellow fascists,
however, which is why the LaRouche
organization has attracted a huge number
of overt Nazis and Klansmen, including
Roy Frankhouser — a former Grand
Dragon of the Pennsylvania Klan — who
became one of LaRouche’s top advisers
in the 1980s.

While many of LaRouche’s closest
collaborators are Jewish, and while the
LaRouche organization has appealed to
some African-Americans with tales of
genocidal U.S. government plots, this
should not detract from the group’s thor-
oughly neo-Nazi character. All the ele-
ments are present, ﬁom Holocaust “revi-
sionism” (LaRouche claims only 1.5 mil-
lion Jews died in the Holocaust) to the
worship of German culture as the highest
achievement of humanity.

However, none of this stopped the
Reagan Administration from coddling
LaRouche, especially in the early 1980s.
LaRouche is a ﬁerce advocate of nuclear
power and an even more staunch promot-
er of Reagan’s notorious Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI, or “Star Wars”),
the fantastical space-based missile-
defense system which Reagan and the

LaRouchites wanted to create at the cost
of untold billions of dollars for the sake of
legitimizing a “first strike” against the
Soviet Union. Reagan Administration

ofﬁcials made use of LaRouchite .

“experts” to promote SDI for years.

The LaRouchites were able to seri-
ously appeal to wealthy conservatives
and senior citizens as promoters of the
president’s defense policies, and they did
so profusely. 8

Similarly — with a few notable
exceptions such as Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan (D., NY) — the Democratic
party took no firm line against the
LaRouchites even as they used the
Democratic party as an electoral vehicle
in numerous places around the country,
sometimes actually - getting candidates
elected to prominent party posts. g

For further information on this nefar-
ious cult, see Lyndon IaRouche and the
New American Fascism, by Dennis King.
It is true that the LaRouche organization
lost a lot of steam in 1988, when its top
leaders were convicted for fraud after
years of embezzling millions of dollars

from senior citizens in “loans” which '

were never .repaid. Nevertheless, the
organization remains alive and well, as its
obviously lavishly funded publications
lying on the ﬂoor in the Towers lobby
attest.

John Lacny is not part of London 3' plot to
get LaRouche.

STAFF REPORT

Football Head Coach Walt Harris uttered eight
words as his players limped and straggled back
to the locker room after a steamy afternoon
practice.

“This camp isn’t for the faint of heart.”

After a sumrner-long conditioning program
of sprinting up stairs, pushing around cars, and
hours in the weight room, the Pitt football team
made its armual journey into the hills of
Johnstown for 12 solid days of football training.

The players literally lived football every
minute of every day. While enduring the swel-
tering heat of late August, they went through an
intense three-per-day practice schedule with the
time between practices consumed by a full slate
of meetings and film study.

The mornings started early with a 6 a.m.
wake-up call. After breakfast and some brief
meetings, the players took the ﬁeld for the day’s
ﬁrst practice at 8 a.m. During this practice, the
position coaches worked with players on devel-
oping solid football technique.

If a player made a mis-
take, a coach exploded
with some individual in-
your-face critiquing.

You can’t take it person-
al,” starting center
Andrew Grischow said.
“You have to take coach-
ing in a positive manner.

‘ at you or complimenting
you, they’re there to
teach you.”

After practice ended,
players immediately
jumped into more meet-
ings, where they’d
review ﬁlms of the last
practice to ﬁne-tune

Now you are part of the Pitt team

Patrick Robertson

Sports Editor

Pittsburgh’s win over Miami last year in
a Thursday night nationally televised game
has always been attributed in a great deal to
the fans by both the coaching statf and the
rest of the athletic department.

“”We played Miami and when I came
out before the game I thought the students
were more into it than any other game,”
Head Coach Walt Harris said, “I was
tremendously surprised and excited

“I heard Steve [Pederson] had a get
together for the students before the game and
Iaskedhimwhatheputintheirdrinksl
thought_our students had their game face
on.”

The coaching staﬂ’ has hung pictures of

already an established organization in regard
to Pittsburgh Panther sports, the Pittsburgh
Athletic Department has started a new pro-
gram called ﬂie Twelfth Man for the sur-
dents. _

This new program came to the attention
of some students when a mailing went home
late in the summer outlining the new pro-

gram and the beneﬁts of becoming a mem-

ber.

The Twelfth Man members will receive
a Twelfth Man T—shirt, mailings from the
athletic department and other special gifts.
The membership extends into basketball
season with Sixth man T-shirts and added
beneﬁts.

Members have to donate a small fee, a
minimum of $10 per membership, to the
Athletic Department to becorrre a member.

Harris believed that the students made
the difference in many games including the
contest with  He said that the students
yelling kept his team going after Miami
surged early and the Panthers ran a double
pass that caused the students to, “erupt”

W*ﬁ°h8aVe.the¥e?m4gr¢aIﬁﬁ~. .,,,, ..

The athletic department was so excited
aftertheMiamigamethatHarrisand
Pederson posted a sign on Lower Campus to
thank the fans for their support.

Pittsburgh has taken advantage of this
new idea by painting all of the student sec-
tions with the number 12 in honor of the
Twelfth Man and by erecting a 20-foot-high
number 12 Panther jersey in Pitt Stadium.

The student sections were labeled sec-
tions 12-17 last year and this year they have
all changed to the Twelfth Section of the sta-
dium. These sections encompass almost
9000 seats, and the ground under the seats
has been painted blue to set it apart even far-
ther.

“The great thing about a student body is
that they all comes together and they’re all
one, so we said that whole section becomes

from the fans and a new commitment from
the team to play for the fans. Fans began

turning out in great numbers as the Panthers

marched toward their ﬁrst Bowl Appearance
in nine years.

Over 80,000 fans showed up for
Pittsburgh’s last two regular season home
games, with an average-sized contingent
maldng the trip to Morgantown to see the
Panthers win the Backyard Brawl.

The athletic department offered free
Liberty Bowl tickets to any student who
could get to the game and 2200 student took
the offer.

“I have a pretty good history of student
ticket sales in Bowl Games at a lot of differ-
ent institutions and I have never seen 2200

students at a Bowl Game,” Pederson said.

This is an exciting time for freshmen
getting their ﬁrst experience of college, but I
don’t have to tell you it can also be armoying.
Every time you turn around, someone else is
there to tell you about more rules you have to
follow. A

Your RA tells you there’s no smoking in
the dorms. The bouncer tells you you’re not
allowed in if you’re under 21. Your room-
mate tells you not to touch his stuff and
explains what the necktie on the doorknob
means.

Well, sorry, but I’m going to lay anoth-
er rule on you. Pitt is the school where you’re
choosing to spend (at least) the next four
years of your life, so now it’s your obligation

to develop some deep, burning school pride. 
Any true fan knows how orgasmic a ‘

feeling it was when Pete Gonzalez threw that
triple—overtime touchdown pass to beat West
Virginia last year, the day after
Thanksgiving, to send Pitt to its ﬁrst bowl

Pitt Pride 101: how to be a Panther fan

 

For over 100 years, Penn State has been
our school’s biggest rival To actually wear
their colors while walking around this cam-
pus is an insult to everyone who ever
enrolled for a class at this University.

But without fail, people will still wear
Penn State garb, even during the week
before that game. But what’s just as bad is
that scores of Pitt folks have grown to accept
that atrocity and don’t give ashit. Stand up
for your school and let those people know
that is just unacceptable.

It was refreshing to see the beginnings
of a resurgence of school pride last year.
Now, more than ever, there’s reason to have
pridein the Panthers. There’s energy and
excitement buzzing all around the
University Walt Harris is the best football

game since 1989. The more pride you had,  j I

the more intense the orgasm was.

Our athletes sweat,- bleed, puke and    
basicallybusttheirballs,allbecauseofthe "

pride have in their school. YOUR  

SCHOOL.

At summer camp in Johnstown, the 

football players battled their way through
three grueling practices a day. Their 250
pound bodies smashed into each other at full
speed You could hear the screams of agony
as the players gasped for air during the end-
less sets of sprints.

The players bring every ounce of their
souls on the ﬁeld; that attitude demands

respect, admiration and support. It should be A
your honor to proudly proclaim you’re a Pitt :

fan.

With the players busting their butts to 
defend the honor of our school, what kind of ;
a message do you think it sends them when '

they look up on game day and see the stadi-
um half empty? What about “fans” and ﬂre

media making jokes and ripping on them iii: ,. 
after a loss? What kind of a message does :  _ 
this send the public at large about our 

school?

Pitt supporters, as was evident in last year’s
nationally televised upset of Miami when we
swarmed the ﬁeld and ripped down the goal
post. But there are always those few cynics.
I get as mad as anybody after we lose,
but the anger is a hatred of losing and a desire

to do better, the same feeling the players .
themse1ves_have. It’s not a cynical bad- , '
mouthing of the team. There’s a big dilfer- A 

ence.
The negativity of many Pitt “fans”
spreads like cancer. At times people don’t

seemto even remember what school pride is. P ;

join Hillgrove courtside to call

0 football for the last 25 years.

The Panther Radio Network
will call KQV (1410 AM) home
as its ﬂagship station. KQV
recently switched to an all—sports
format and snatched the rights
from WTAE, who had broadcast
the Panthers for nearly 30 years.

“It’s unfortunate that such. a
long—standing relationship should
come to an end, but the broadcast
business right now is in a state of
flux,” Hillgrove said.

WTAE also lost the Penguins
this year, and there is doubt that it
will be around in 1999 after
switching to all—sports just a cou-
ple of years ago.

The station has had many
problems in the last few years and
it was not giving Pitt everything it

A needed in a ﬂagship station.

“The situation was very unset-
tled at WTAE, and still is fairly
unsettled. WTAE kept saying ‘be
patient,’ and for whatever reason,
Steve.Pederson said ‘we have to
sell our. product,’ and he went a
different way,” Hillgrove said.

The Panther Radio Network
will be run by Pinnacle Sports
Productions which is based in

Omaha, Neb. Pinnacle Sports‘

hold the rights to University of
Nebraska games as well.

“The creation of the new
Panther Sports Radio Network is
a wonderful development for the
University and its many sports
fans,” Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg said. _

During the football season,
fans will have the chance to listen
to more Panther talk than ever

before, in addition to a radio call- .

in show with head coach Walt
Harris.

This move also gives listeners
from- more places a chance to hear
the games with many more affili-
ates planned all over Pittsburgh
pennsylvania.

“I want Panther fans from
around the state of Pennsylvania
to hear our broadcasts and a
strong network is essential to the
growth of our program,” Athletics
Director Steve Pederson said.

The president of Pinnacle
Sports Productions, Paul Aaron,
graduated from Pittsburgh, so he
has strong ties to the school and
the city. _

“I’m delighted and excited
about working _ with the
University of Pittsburgh Athletic
Department,”iAaron said. “It’s a
particular thrill to be able to come
back to my alma mater and partic-
ipate in the program. Having
worked with Steve Pederson at
Nebraska, I believe that there are
some tremendously positive
things in store for the University
of Pittsburgh.” I

New recruits look to help Panther football early

Kevin Lilley‘

' ' Senior Football Wrlter

Ike is happy.

In one 90-minute practice at
Panther football camp, Isaac “Ike”
Williams got to greet four of his new
teammates personally.

First, fellow recruit Amir Purifoy
met Ike helmet—on—helmet in an open-
field hit, sending the 205-pounder
skidding across the J ohnstown grass.
Then it was letter-winning ' junior
Karim Thompson with a shoulder to
Ike’s ribs, followed by Charlie
Steffey with a bone‘-jarring shot to
Ike’s chin, complete with post-tackle
celebration.

Finally, transfer defensive line-
man Nigel Neal clobbered Ike in
post-practice drills, jamming his
hand under Williams’ face mask and
shoving him backward until coaches
whistled the drill to a close.

Ike is happy. A transfer from
Pasadena City College, he is one of
over 25 new faces on the 1998
Panther roster.

“I’m loving it,” said the junior. “I
got a couple nagging injuries that
I’ve got to take care of, but I’m real-
ly enjoying myself.” A

Williams played his high school
ball in Maryland (a big reason for his
move to Pitt — his fiancee, son, and

parents all live on the East Coast),
but he joins a class of 12 players
coming to Pitt from California junior
colleges. ' ' '
‘Of that dozen, Williams and
offensive lineman Mark Browne
should see the most playing time,
with Browne playing left tackle on
the first unit and Williams slated for
backup tailback and kick—return duty.
Another Golden State lineman, 6-
foot—7, 290-pound Ryan Hansen, may
see action at right tackle, facing off
with fifth-year vet Jason Dugger for
the starting nod. .
Neal, from California’s Cerritos
College, could see action on the
defensive line, and John "Turman, a

"junior from Los Medanos College,

fought what looks like a losing battle
for the starting quarterback job with
Matt Lytle. .

The West Coast recruiting drive
focused on junior college products
only — no high school newcomers
made the cross-country trip this sea-
son. The strength of the high school
class comes from close to home, with
linebacker Purifoy and running back
Brandon Williams leading a group of
highly touted local players.

Williams averaged 10.2 yards per
carry over four years at Valley High
in nearby New Kensington. His
senior season his averaged slipped to

just below a first down per attempt,
but his 9.9—yard average made him
the second—ranked recruit in the state.

Pitt Head Coach Walt Harris said
the Valley grad has “more maturity
than a true freshman,” claiming that

‘the physical workout presented more

of a challenge to Williams than the
mental strain of adjusting to college
football.

« “There’s a lot to learn, a ton to
memorize, (but) I feel I’m carrying
along pretty well,” Williams agreed.

Purifoy joined Williams and
Plum High _ School grad Joe
Manganello at the Big 33 All Star
game this season, reserved for high
school standouts in Pennsylvania and
Ohio. In summer workouts, Ike was-
n’t the only. running back to feel
Purifoy’s shoulder pads —— the Steel
Valley, Pa. alum worked his way onto
the first unit in the first week of
camp. ‘ '

Off the field, Purifoy is less of a
monster. Instead of discussing
schemes and formations, he focused
on the charity work that he and his
teammates did before the Big 33 con-
test, visiting hospitals and talking to
mentally challenged children.

“It makes you thank God for the
ability and the talent that you have,”
he said.

Manganello’s ability may equal

his impressive 285—pound frame, but
he may not be able to showcase it this
season — with Hansen, Browne and
redshirt—freshman Mike Bosnic see-
ing the most plays at tackle,
PrepStar’s eighth-ranked offensive
lineman could be redshirted.

West Allegheny’s Brandon
Dewey entered camp without the
hype of Williams or Purifoy, but has
played with the first unit at defensive
end. Veterans Marlin Young and
Julian Graham look to nail down
starting jobs, but Graham called
Dewey one of the top three freshmen
in camp this summer.

Dewey’s path became easier with
just a week left in camp, after transfer
Pete Simonian went down with a
knee injury. Simonian, a starter last
season for the now-defunct Boston
University football team, dueled
Young for the right-end spot all
spring, and may have had it won
before the injury.

Three local walk-ons could also
make an impact. Steffey, from
Oakmont High, helps fill out ‘a thin
defensive line corps with his 255
pounds. Upper St. C1air’s Tim Stein
returned punts for much of the

' J ohnstown camp, and Woodland Hills

graduate Tyler Novak may figure into
the open quarterback race in the 1999
season.

CAMP

FROM PAGE 29

mechanics and footwork. Immediately
following the meeting, the team took the
ﬁeld again for practice number two.

This practice involves everything
from passing drills to blocking schemes
to defensive formation work. Under the
watchful eyes of a coaching staff with
over 170 years of combined college and
professional experience, the Panther
players attacked the football and each
other with a mix of discipline and feroci-
ty.

“The intensity, that’s been estab-
lished,” said defensive line coach Bob
Junko. “It’s got to keep going. The
youngsters have to understand that.”

Junko, one of those in—your—face
coaches, set the pace of the camp with
obscenity laden tirades directed at devel-
oping and molding the players.

The afternoon was ﬁlled with more
meetings designed to develop and
expand the offensive and defensive pack-
ages. Plays were dissected and film was
reviewed before the team took the ﬁeld
for the final practice of the day around 5
p.m.

The evening practice involved live
scrimmaging and full—contact, offense-
versus—drills, which had a way of really
firing up the team.‘

The practice ﬁnished with what
seemed like endless sets of wind sprints.
Sweat dripped off of the exhausted play-
ers as they pushed their bodies to the
limit, running up and down the ﬁeld so
many times that even the spectators got
tired.

But after a summer of the condition-
ing practices of Strength Coach Buddy
Morris — pushing dumpsters, carrying
cinder blocks, and running, running, run-
ning —— the players know how important
it is and were more than prepared for the
grueling sprints.

“Sprints are second nature now,”
Grischow explained. “Buddy Morris is
the reason we’re in such good shape.”

After sprints and a few more meet-
ings, the players enjoyed a late dinner
before collapsing into bed only to start
the process over again the next morning
at 6. .

For the coaches, summer camp is a

time to ‘evaluate players and begin to.

piece together a starting lineup. Foremost
on everyone’s’ mind was the competition
at quarterback, where officially it was a
tl1ree—man race between ﬁfth-year senior
Matt Lytle and junior college transfers
John Turman and Matt O’Connor.

But unofﬁcially, Lytle wrapped up
the starting job early. The strong throw-
ing lefty sparkled in camp, displaying
pin-point accuracy and an experienced
knowledge of the intricate West Coast
Offense. \

“He put his time in [working in the
offseason], and I believe that’s paid off in
his knowledge of our. offense,” Hanis
said of his quarterback. _

Another topic on the minds of many
Panther fans was the progress of high

' proﬁle freshmen Brandon Williams, a

speedy running back, andAmir Purifoy, a
hard hitting linebacker. The two local
stars highlighted Pitt’s highest—rated
recruiting classesin years.

“We are pleased with them,” Harris
said of the progress of his prize recruits,
who both ﬁgure to see signiﬁcant playing
time this season. “Amir is going to be a
good football player for us. He is real
serious about doing a good job for us.

“One thing we like about Brandon is
that he is very focused. He works hard on
trying to do the little things, and you
don’t have to tell him many times.” '

Hanis and his staff worked hard to
develop this team both "mentally and
physically. They realize that developing a
winning attitude is just as important than
any on—the-ﬁeld work. ,

The in-your-face style of coaching
paid off last year as a number of unher-
alded freshmen and scrap—heap veterans
developed into primary contributors to
the Liberty Bowl season.

The players and coaches all hope top
see the results of all the hard work and
dedication earlier than last year, when the
team gelled in the fourth quarter of the
ninth game against Syracuse. '

Coach Harris and his staff have said
all along that “champions are made when
no one is looking and in order to be a
champion you have to love the
process”...as grueling as it may be.

Kevin Lilley, Brian Knavish and
Patrick Robertson contributed at this
report.

to pay respect to the people who came out to
see them and the team would sing the ﬁght

Negotiate the buses

By BONNIE HEWITT

No driving or sitting in rush—hour
traffic. No worrying about being late
for work or school. No hassles of fmd-
ing. a parking space or change for a
meter. No parking tickets from our
loyal Parking Enforcement Agents. But
that’s only if you catch the bus.

Port Authority can get you to just
about anywhere you want to ‘go. The
best thing about it,’ with the new
Pitt/Port Authority deal, is students and
faculty can go anywhere in Allegheny
County for free with a valid University
of Pittsburgh ID and a small fee added
to tuition.

Port Authority offers a wide selec-
tion of bus service, the T-system (sub-
way) and the Duquesne and
Monongehela inclines, but not every-
thing about Port Authority comes up
roses.

Sure, Port Authority can get you

     
 

. to Highland Park. 71C takes passengers
down Ellsworth Avenue to the heart of

Oakland for the commuter

through Greenﬁeld and Squirrel hill, to

Shadyside, and 71D goes via Fifth Avenue, _
bypassing Shadyside for a quicker ride.
The Bad:
-Tangled trafﬁc slows the 71A more
than most buses.
The Ugly:
, -The 71s don’t really get ugly because
they run until 2 a.m., later than most buses,
which makes up for the shortcomings.

54C — Oakland-Mt. Oliver
The Good:
-It’s the beeline to the South Side in a

‘ quick_ten minutes.

The Bad: _

-The last bus leaves the South Side at
1:13 a.m., so it’s not good for a late
night-
The Ugly:

,—It is one of the most erratic buses
and is rarely on time, making it poor for
a tight schedule.

56U — Oakland-Greenﬁeld
The Good:
-It’s a quick run from Hazelwood,

The Bad:

The Ugly:

-It doesn’t run on Saturday, Sunday.

just about anywhere, but it’s. almost
guaranteed to take twice as long, if not
longer, than any other mode. During
rush hour, passengers are packed in like
a bunch of sardines.

Port Authority’s new public rela-
tions campaign to become more con-
sumer-oriented will result in aesthetic
changes. The company plans to paint all
of its buses gold and change the logo.
But the insides of the buses are worn,
too. People might appreciate a clean red
and white bus more than a dirty gold
one. _ ’

Some drivers just don’t carry
through on company mandates. The
sign at the front of the bus clearly reads:

No open food or drink. No radios with-

out headphones. No open strollers. No
littering. No smoking. But the bus dri-

vers are tolerant as long as passengers .

behave and have their fares ready. Open
beverages and half-eaten sandwiches
are common sights.

ow that PAT buses will get you most every-
where with a simple ﬂash of a Pitt ID, the incentive has
increased to explore Pittsburgh in its entirety. Restaurants,
clubs, bars, shops, concert venues and art exhibitions
inhabit the surrounding areas — some good, some bad.
There are enough activities and places to visit to ﬁll many a
weekend and off day. To help you avoid the occasional
turkey, a list of highlights for each neighborhood have been
compiled as a guide to some new hot spots, the classics and
those that persist under the radar. We've omitted chain
’ stores, for the most part, because they are predictable in

what they offer. By no means are these lists totally compre-
hensive. It’ s only a guide toget newcomers started.

OAKLAND

1. Carnegie Library, Museum and Music Hall (4400 Forbes
Ave.) — A classic getaway for both Pitt and CMU students.
Lose yourself in the catacombs of the library, catch a lec-
ture or performance at the music hall, or dodge third-
graders in the art 8: natural history museums. One of the
most overlooked aspects of the museum is, its cinema
series, which shows rare, controve._rsial,. and fo’re_ign’films,»
many of which never made. it to ‘video.  .

2. Phipps Conservatory (Schenley Park)~- An oasis in a
grimy, post-industrial town. Phipps is expanding as we
speak, and Schenley Park has enough attractions to keep
anyone busy year-round. Ice skating,‘ tennis, golf and hik-
ing are just the beginning in this park that separates
Oakland from Squirrel Hill. ‘

3. Mad Mex (370 Atwood St.) - Cheap food (half-price :
:after 11 p.m.), expensive beer and prompt service are the
order at Mad .Mex. Watch how much Habanero sauce you
put on that burrito - there's not much light in the place.
Wait for a server to burst forth from the kitchen with food
and light, then shake. '

4. Fuel 8: Fuddle (214 Oakland Ave.) - Another place to
get heaps of food atreasona-ble prices, this time with bet-
ter lighting and a beautifully renovated brick interior and
exterior. Try to make a deal with the servers for some
extra nacho cheese. ' '

5. Original Hot Dog Shop (3901 Forbes Ave.) -
;”Originally,” a place to grab a bite to eat before or after a
§Bucs game at what used to be Forbes Field across the
‘street. Now, it's a bit more existential. Watch the half-life
;on those french fries.

T6. Classic Video (418 S. Craig St.) - This is the place to get
those obscure videos. -The atmosphere is familiar as a total
contrast to the corporate monster that is Blockbuster.

.7. Dave's Music Mine (3710 Forbes Ave.) - Not under-
;ground, as the name may lead you to believe, but at the
itop of a rickety staircase. They've bought out Aunt Hilda’sr
‘across the street recently, so expect an even greater collec-
tion of musical gems. V

8. Avalon (115 Atwood St.) - Hype trends are abound. The
clothes are great, but the prices stink. If you've got the
cash, it's the place to shop. .

9. Tela Ropa (116 Atwood St.) — Stoner chic is back in
§style, and Tela Ropa’s the place to gear up. Grateful Dead

Tuunsmv, 21 Aucusr 1998

}belt buckles, hemp neckwear, and the inevitable tie-dye
silkscreens compete for space with more contemporary fashions.
10. Laga (3609 Forbes Ave.) - The rules are turned upside down.
The barflies sit in a cage while the kiddies rule the dance floor.

See a band before they make it big, or see a band who might break-

up next week. Anything goes at Laga.

SQUIRREL HILL

1. Squirrel Hill Cafe (5802 Forbes Ave.) — This bar, located on the
corner of Murray and Forbes Avenues in the very heart of the
neighborhood,~is known colloquially as the ”Squirrel Cage” or
simply ”The Cage” because of all the activity inside that leads
absolutely nowhere, much as a squirrel on a wheel. Food and
drinks are cheap, but beware the jukebox which may replace your
request for Jimi Hendrix with Nirvana if your karma is bad.

2. Barnes 8: Noble Booksellers (.1723 Murray Ave.) - Go there for
the books, stay for the coffee at the small Starbucks inside. It's
good for special-ordering that book for your lit class that they ran
out of at the Book Center, as well as the amusing woodcuts of
famous authors on the shopping-bags. Open until 11 p.m. helps.
3. Gullifty’s (1922 Murray Ave.) - The meals are average, but the
desserts are second to none. Try the carrot cake "and the multiple
cheesecakes. Always voted Best in Pittsburgh. _ 2 .

4. Giant Eagle (1901 Murray Ave.) - Not the largest Giant Eagle,
but it's right on the 61C bus route so it's worth going to if you
don't have a car. The selection here is uniquely tailored to
Squirrel Hill's vibrant Jewish population. _

5. Jewish Community Center (5738 Forbes Ave.) - Has numerous
recreational facilities as well as providing a common meeting
place for Squirrel Hill's diverse Jewish population (Orthodox,
Conservative, Reformed.) Artistic and educational presentations
make the JCC a worthwhile place to visit for citizens of all faiths.
6. Manor Theatre (1729 Murray Ave.) 8: Squirrel Hill Theatre
(5824 Forward Ave.) - Together, these jointly-owned theatres com-
bine for a 10 screen ”multiplex,” with the four-screen Manor“ '
always showing films different from its six-screen sister on
Forward Avenue. The Manor is closer to Pitt; the Squirrel Hill
Theatre has been recently renovated.

7. 61C Cafe (1839 Murray Ave.) -Named for the Port Authority
bus route, of course, it's a clean, locally owned alternative to
Starbucks that provides a welcome jolt to morning commuters as
well as a sustaining buzz for insomniacs.

8. Wissman’s Forward Lanes (5844 Forward Ave.) - Located in the
same row of buildings as the Squirrel Hill Theatre (thanks to the
wonders of soundproofing), Woody Harrelson learned to bowl
here before filming ”Kingpin.” Its quirky second-floor location
and food and beverages provided by Champs’ Sports Bar down-'
stairs make it a favorite among yinzers of all ages.

9. Heads Together/ Bookworm (1914 Murray Ave.) - Small-time
movie rental still thrives in Squirrel Hill, thanks to Heads

selection of used books at affordable prices, and has an under-
ground feel you won't find on the second floor of Barnes 8: Noble.
10. Jerry's Records (2136 Murray Ave.) - It's, by far, the best place

’* in town to find your favorite groups on vinyl. The store occupies

a massive second floor with albums lining the walls and filling

E1‘.

Together’s eclectic selection of videos. The Bookworm has a great g

. SOUTH SIDE
1. Randy's Alternative Music (1210 E. Carson St.) -All kinds of -
music, new and used, are there for the taking. Even the most

I obscure albums are within these walls. And more popular used cds

are easy to find because they're kept on_a center table, like a glori-
ous Noah's Ark.

1 2.. Smokin’ Joe's (2001 E. Carson St.) — For good wings and a wide
1 selection of beer, Joe's is at the top of the heap. They sport good
1 bar food and the right stuff to wash it down. The long bar sports

enough seats for quite a few people to belly up to it.
3. Nick's Fat City (1601 E. Carson St.) - The best local bands can
found behind the doors at Nick's. The venue showcases mostly —

4. Lava Lounge (2204 E. Carson St.) - Tuesday nights are packed at
Lava as DJ Spike spins the vinyl. Both the bar and the dance floor
are small, penning in the energy. Plus, the lounge has some wicked
cave-like designs. .

5. Beehive (1327_ E. Carson St.) - The coffeehouse offers the under-
age crowd a hip place to hang, since the Oakland Beehive opened‘
a bar. The coffee is notthe greatest, but it's a place to see and be
seen if you're younger. ‘ J

6. The Pretzel Shop (2316 E. Carson St.) - Have a pizza pretzel or
just a plain pretzel. This inexpensive restaurant offers them in
every form. It's quick and tasty, beating out a stale fast food burg-
er any day.

  Bringing out thenew
breed in hardcore

By D. SUMMERS

Not since the days of Biohazard,
primo Bad Brains and prime Slayer
has there been a band as brutal,
intense or ﬁerce as Hatebreed.

The New Haven, Conn., group
produces an extreme that would
reduce the daredevils in Mountain
Dew commercials to tears. Hatebreed
deals with the dark underbelly of life.
The lyrics espoused by frontman
Jamie Iasta look at life through a dark
set of glasses.

Hatebreed’s new album
Satisfaction Is The Death Of Desire,
released by Chicago-based hardcore
specialists Victory Records, proves
that in spades. This Sunday,
Hatebreed brings the darkness to
Club Laga on Forbes Avenue in
Oakland. .

‘ They don't let up from the ﬁrstriff
and the first shout of vocals until the
end. Virgin ears will bleed profusely
throughout the show and blistered
feet are likely to be the result of
inevitable moshing. But beneath the
physical pain the CD may cause,

V

there's a point to
the music.
Underneath the
lyrics and the riffs,
there's a liberating

catharsis to
unabashed mad-
ness.

The band's
inspiration for its
current album came
when things

weren't going well
on the last tour.
Jasta saw a TV
show on
Muhammad Ali in
whichAli said thatif

he'd stayed in the ghetto, he never .

would have achieved his status. It was
that kind of thinking that inspired
Jasta along with Lou Richards (gui-
tar), Chris Beattie (bass), Matt
Macintosh (guitar) and Jamie

Muckinhaumpt (drums) to saunter on '

despite the troubles.

The secret reason Hatebreed is
one of the up-and-comers in hardcore
is that they're obsessive metal fans.

Sonia Dada set to bring
eclectic sound to town

By D. SUMMERS

They may well be Chicago's answer to the
Neville Brothers. Their base is funk, but they add
rock, world beat, gospel and Sly and The Family
Stone harmonies to the mix making it an inter-
esting musical melting pot that has fans dancing
in‘ the aisles.

And this Saturday, Sonia Dada bring their
groove to Grafitti Showcase to promote their
new album, My Secret Life.

For those of you wondering who is Sonia’

Dada, no one in the band is named Sonia. The
name belongs to an old Jordanian friend of band
leader Dan Pritzker (guitar). There are eight
members in.Sonia, three of them are vocalists,

A which may remind some of Three Dog Night's

classic lineup and the Neville Brothers. Their
eclectic form of music has been gaining accep-
tance at Adult Album Alternative stations like

WYEP, but Pritzker would like to start pulling in,

the rock fans. Touring venues like Grafitti is a
means to that end.

Sonia Dada formed in Chicago at the start of
1990. The original members were Pritzker, Erik
Scott (bass), Hank Guaglianone (drums), Dave
Resnik (guitar), Chris Cameron(keyboards) and
a variety of lead singers. Just like any other band,

they had the usual ambitions of MTV, big hits on -

the radio, SRO shows, etc., but they didn't work
out as planned.

 

PEMAN ECAR E

Their changing suc-
cession of vocalists did
not help. Pritzker_ was
on his way to a "baseball
game when he heard
Michael Scott, Paris
Delane and Sam Hogan
harmonizing at a sub-
way stop. They were
the missing link to what
Pritzker, wanted. The
three gospel-trained ’
singers and the other
members formed Sonia
Dada and released their
self-titled debut CD in
1992. By that time, they .
were gaining a following in Chicago and on the
east coast, attracting the attention of Capricorn
Records.

Their next CD, A Day at the Beach, became a
favorite on AAA radio with tracks -such as
”Screaming John” and ”Planes and Satellites.”
Their live sets became known for their intensity
and their ”all over the place” showmanship.
However, just before they started work on their
current CD, Hogan left to pursue a solo career.
They could have gotten another gospel-inﬂu-
enced singer but they selected the club veteran
Shawn Christopher as a new vocalist.

Reborn and recharged, Sonia Dada came

L -The memrs of Soniaqda harbor a wealth of talent.

back with My Secret Life, which has all members
of the group contributing to the songs and guests
such as Lester Bowie and Kahil El Zabar helping
out. It’ s that kind of eclecticism that works well
with a multi-racial outﬁt like Sonia Dada. They
can wear their inﬂuences on -their sleeves and use
it to good effect. A '
Christopher's sweeping vocals draw the
spotlight to the ballad ”Don’t Go (Giving Your
Love Away).” Then, the next track, ”Phases of

blues ﬂavor. The sudden shift symbolizes Sonia
Dada’s vast sound.
A live show has something for everybody.

Jocelyn Montgomery adds her incomparable soprano to Lux Vixens.

David Lynch

By D. Summers

David Lynch dug around in the past
and found something to bring back with

It’ s never certain what a man who uses
animal carcasses and ants in his hanging
art will unearth or create. For example, he
has directed truly mesmerizing ﬁlms from
Eraserhead to Blue Velvet. This time he has
scraped up some old songs, dusted them
off and recruited a talented songstress to
add the perfect polish. The new album Lux
Vixens is the result.

David Lynch came up with a beautiful
new album that explores a few familiar
themes —— religion, Vindication and the con-
temporizing the past. His artful production
presents a smooth, unified recording.

Despite the album's ingenuity, it surely
won't be played on B-94 until they start
playing 12th Century German sacred music
alongside Matchbox 20 and Hanson. In
fact, this album not only marks Lynch's
return to music; it is also the debut of
Jocelyn Montgomery, the album's vocalist.

’ Lux Vixens came about through Lynch's
fascination with the music of an outspoken,

L ' 12th century nun. Hﬂdegard Von Bingen

was one of the most radical feminists of her

 ’ time. She was also thought to be a child

prophet whose visions culminated in the
text ”SciVias — Know the Ways.” She was

Tnunsomr, 27 Auousr 1998

goes sacred

even challenged by Pope Eugene III to fur-
' ther prophesy, and eventually was con-

ﬁrmed as a visionary by the pope.

’ Lynch needed a singer who could make
Von Bingen’s music her own. Although she
had no interest in a recording deal, Jocelyn
Montgomery’ s vocal style attracted Lynch
and Lux Vixens is their debut. A

Lynch opens the album with ”Flame
and Vision,” which evokes images of a
fiery sky and landscapes ravaged ‘by
storms. It works to jolt the listener into a
curiously introspective mind-set. Each song
consumes and haunts you with -its surreal-
ism. It’ s a beautiful revival of an artistic
expression that’ s nine centuries old. This is

1 art in its beauty and texture —- layered and
complex.

Montgomery’ s voice echoes as though
she were singing in a large abandoned
cathedral in outstanding pieces like ”Lux
Vixens,” the title track, and ”Sapientie.”
Montgomery’ s soprano touches the soul
with Von Bingen’s words, deeper each time
you press play.

Lux Vixens is incredibly unique. There

are no hooks, no gloss and no sheento the .

music. It is designed to be as faithful to Von
Bingen’s Latin originals. But it’ s still a Very
interesting period piece that someone like
David Lynch can filter through his vision.
Listen with an open mind and leave your
prejudices about sacred music at the door.

Pittsburgh. .

8. Fat Head's (E. Carson St.) - Great wings and 21 beers on tap

earn this joint a place on the list. Only a less—inspired atmos-
here keeps it below Smokin’ ]oe’s.

. Station Square boasts a slew of shops and restaurants, includ-
ing Woodson’s, a worthwhile sports bar. It can be busy, but
.patience is rewarded.

10. Thrift shops populate the South Side. Grab a yellow pages
and take a few hours to sift through the riches at each one.

SHADYSIDE,
1. Ritters Diner (5221 Baum Blvd.) - It's open 24 hours and the
food beats Eat ‘N Park, hands down. Try the corned beef hash.
2. Taco Bell (5205 Baum Blvd.) - This is the closest Taco Bell to
Oakland in case you get that craving for imitation Mexican food.
3. Buffalo Blues (216 S. Highland Ave.) - As the area's premiere
blues venue, the bar does not rest on its laurels. The wings could
make a vegan drool and it's one of the top ten places to watch
Monday Night Football. ,
4. Soba Lounge (5847 Ellsworth Ave.) - Wednesday is the best
night for Soba with a packed house. The bar is expensive and the
cover hovers around three bucks, but it's a trendy club, which are
not prolific in Pittsburgh. . '

_ 5. Harris Grill (5747 Ellsworth Ave.) - Good food and fair prices
are OK, but the large patio is the selling point. Entire evenings can
be spent lounging under the looming umbrellas.

6. Doc's Place (5442 Walnut St.) - This is the most collegiate of the
Shadyside bars with a fraternity atmosphere. ’ A

7. Hey Betty (5892 Ellsworth Ave.) - An awesome thrift shop
inspired by everything '50s. . .
8. Dancing Goats Coffee Co. (5830 Ellsworth Ave.) — A spacious
cafe with a healthy number of outdoor seats.

9. Years Ago-GO (Ellsworth Ave.) — When you walk in" the door,
it's like tacky antiques blew up in front of you in all of their col-
orful glory. The prices are not small. A’

10. Walnut Street shops — Pottery Barn is coming and Victoria's
Secret is already there, but Walnut offers shopping the way it was
before the birth of the mall.
