U.S. Rep.]oe Sestak beat ﬁve-term
U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter yesterday
in a close Democratic primary
election that I received national
and international attention. I

Sestak, D-Delaware County,‘

won by a 7-percent margin, tak-
ing 53.8 percent of the vote, while
Specter received 46.2 percent of
the vote, with almost 99 percent
of precincts reporting.

Sestak will take on Republican
Pat Toomey, who received 80.9
percent of vote, in November for
Pennsylvania’s only Senate seat
up for election. Democratic Sen.
Bob Casey, who will be up for re-

election in 2012, holds the other

A seat.

A Quinnipiac University poll
taken Monday put the Toomey—

Sestak contest within ﬁve percent- I
I age points.

Specter pledged his support of
Sestak in the fall against Toomey,
who nearly defeated Specter in
a close Republican primary in

tweeted his support shortly af-
ter conceding at his Philadelphia
headquarters; _

The special election in Dis-
trict 12, which includes nearby

Four voting machines stood ready
in Posvar Hall yesterday. Pitt juniors
Brittany Quinn and Kate Fricchione
sat nearby, prepared to assist vot-
ers as election judge and inspector,
respectively, for Oak]and’s Ward 4,
District 8. The only thing missing
were the voters. .. _, .

“I think we’ve had 10 voters,”
Quinn said shortly after noon. “And
two of them were us.”

Yesterday marked primary elec-
tion day in Pennsylvania. Voters
chose Republican and Democratic
candidates to run for U.S. senator,
governor and lieutenant governor,
among other positions, in the No-
vember general elections.

Historically, primary elections

represent a smaller voter turnout

The county elections division re-

From QB

Just three seasons ago, Kevan
Smith was a quarterback for Pitt,
starting three games that season.

Smith is still throwing a ball in a
Panthers uniform, but there’s one
difference — it’s a baseball.

Now in his second season as
a catcher and designated hitter
on the baseball team, Smith is re-
minding everyone why he was a
two-sport star in high school.

He was a catcher at Seneca Val-
ley High School, about 40 minutes
north of Pittsburgh. He was pro-
jected by some to be drafted into
the major leagues, being named
the class AAAA Player of the Year
by the WPIAL Baseball Coaches
Association. But he was also a
standout quarterback.

Despite his football success, he

I still wasn’t sure he had a future in

the sport. _

“I actually didn’t think I was go-
ing to play football before my high
school football coach said he’d get
me a scholarship,” Smith said. “I
didn’t believe him, and he got me
one just through playing in camps
and everything.” .

Unsure of what his baseball fu-
ture might hold, he took advantage
of the attention from colleges. that

Senior Brandon Miller remembers
waiting in lines that were “out the
door” during the 2008 primaries,

i when Barack Obama ran against

Hillary Clinton for the Democratic
presidential nomination.

' “I knew it wouldn’t be nearly as
bad, but there’s no one here,’.’ Miller
said, adding that the lack of turnout
makes each individual vote more
important.

Miller was not the only person
who noticed a low turnout among
young voters.

“Typically, when you look at the-

numbers, it is hard to get the 18-25
electoral out there,” said Chet Harhut,
Pennsylvania’s state commissioner
of elections.

Harhut, a Pitt alumnus, said the
state governmenttried to incite young

voters to participate in elections by
sending out voting reminders in text
messages and by using Facebook. He
felt that the tight Democratic Senate
race between incumbent Sen. Arlen

4 Specter and challenger Rep. Joe Ses-

tak might also improve the turnout.

Pitt senior Vince Schiarelli was
speciﬁcally excited to vote in the
senatorial contest. He said he .voted_
for Sestak.

“It took me a while, but I ﬁgured
Arlen’s getting old,” said Schiarelli,
who votes regularly in the primary
elections. “Sometimes, the vote for

your partyis more important than

the general election.”
Though some students came to

election centers with the intent to .

vote, others found themselves casting

ballots after they saw the machines

set up on their way to classes.

After a close race in the polls
leading up to the primary, former
congressional aide Mark Critz
took an early lead in the reported
precincts and never let up. Critz
took in 53.4 percent of the vote,

followed shortly by the Associated
Press, MSNBC and other media
outlets. '
About the possibility of taking

Allegheny County Executive
Dan Onorato took the Democratic
nomination for governor with 45.1
percent of the vote.

“Harrisburg culture has eroded

ing his celebration at International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers

headquarters in the South Side.

“Pennsylvania needs a governor

A reason to vote: taxes

“It seems like most of our voters
are coming through for classes, see
us here and decide to vote,” Fricchi-
one said.

Senior Adam Stough said he votes
in every election but honestly didn’t
remember that Tuesdaywas an elec—
tion day until passingby the machines
in Posvar Hall. He ended up voting
for Auditor Generaljack Wagner in-
stead of Allegheny County Executive
Dan Onorato, the other candidate he
was considering in the gubernatorial
race. State Sen. Anthony Williams and
Montgomery County Commissioner

Joe Hoeffel also ran for the Demo-
cratic nomination for governor.

Voter turnout inprimary elections
has decreased signiﬁcantly across
the county since the 2008 elections.
In 2008, 379,238 ofthe 913,628 reg-
istered voters in Allegheny County
voted. During last year’s primary for
mayor and other oﬂices, only 183,918
of 902,976 registeredvoters entered
the voting booth.

Pitt political science professor Su-

san Hansen gives students two words
when asked about the importance
of student participation in primary
elections: t11itionta_x. '

 

Hansen said the Fair Share Tax, a '

taxproposedlastyearby Mayor Luke
Ravenstahl, nearly passed because of
students’ apathy at the polls.

“What really elected the mayor
wasthe primary,” Hansen said of the
2009 primary.”Students just didn’t
come ou .” .

Hansenfeels thatthe poor student
turnout in primary elections can be
attributed in large part to a lack of
media coverage. “There hasn’t been
nearly enough hype and ads,” she
said. “Just comparing this to 2008.”

She also said that registration
presents a problem for college stu-
dents, because of the frequent chang-
es in address associated with college
life. Despite these challenges, Hansen
encourages students to pay atten-

tion to local and state governmental ~

elections, especially with the impact
the upcoming general election will
have on higher education and Port
Authority funding.

Sitting and waiting for voters to
come late in the day at the Posvar
election site, Quinn and Fricchione
recalled the time they spent in politi-
cal science classrooms. Today they
leamed a new lesson.

“We learned people don’t vote,”
Fricchione said. '

For The Pitt News

The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh is
not in “immediate danger” of closing
any of its branches, according to one
of its administrators. But the orga-
nization is still seeking donations to
help cover the $1 million in funding
that won’t come through because
theituition tax failed. '
Suzanne Thinnes, communica-
tion manager for the libraries, said
late last week that the CLP is not
in immediate danger of closing or
merging any branches and is “in a

is “workingwith.the communityand

says that the CLP is committed to

it needs need the public’s help. She
said people need to let their elected
officials know how important the
Carnegie library system is to them,
and that the CLP will greatly rely on
individual donations.

Her words came after City Coun-
cil voted to postpone legislation that
would have given $600,000 to
bolster the suffering branches, and
about a week after a letter from the
library’s chairwoman to the mayor
was released. A

State Rep. Dan Frankel, D-Allegheny was on ,
 Monday’s forum. He said that, unlike 

sorrieéf his colleagues, he does not view the
 M budget as adiscretionary item. As the
fede:
in strictlyinondiscretionary items — such as
basic education, cdriféctions, criminal justice
and medicine — the library system has seen its
funding cut. With Pennsylvania state revenues
now around $1 billion, the only remaining way
to balance the budget is to reduce expenses,
Frankel said.

“We need to ﬁnd a balance between 'ﬁs-
cal responsibility and generating additional
revenue. It’s not just about cutting spending all
the time,” he said. Frankel suggested that the
budget shortfalls could be made up by taxing
tobacco products, other than cigarettes, and by
taxing energy extraction for coal and Marcel-
lus Shale gas, saying that Pennsylvania is the
only state that taxes neither of these.

The only new source of revenue for Al-

’ legheny County’s library systems came in the
form of tax revenue from casino gaming, with‘
a 1 percent pledge, which Frankel says experts

estimate will be about $1 million per year. This k
money would be split between the Allegheny.

Nicole Swerhun, a facilitator for the CLP,

Ringingthe alarm   Browsing through
the neighborhood

on engagements _

ven if you like it, you might want to
reconsider putting a ring on it.
If the engagement gets called off,
you might not getit back.
A New York man recently sued his former

ﬁancee after she called off their four-month

engagement and refused to return the $17,500
ring, according to Slate. ’ »

The case called into question whether an
engagement ring constitutes simply a gift or
a conuact — ‘-‘the exchange of a ring for the

. promise to wed,” Slate reports.

After marriage, such things are considered
marital property and divided inhalf. But before

marriage ,we have to rely on rules of etiquette. ‘

Unless, of course, we sue, inwhich case it seems
necessary to view such trials on a case- -case
basis.

There are many situations during which it _

‘ can be argued that either party should get to

keep the ring, depending, for example, on who

called off the engagement orwhether one party .

wronged the other. But in most cases, it doesn’t
seem socially acceptable to keep the ring, even
if it is viewed as a gift.

But mature adults, who at least used to care ‘

about each other, should not need a courtroom
to resolve these issues. Ifthis was someone you
could tolerate enough to consider spendingthe
rest of your life with, why can’t you settle matters
using rules of etiquette instead of suing? if you
can’t, maybe you shouldn’t go around popping
the question or accepting marriage propos-
als.Just like getting married shouldn’t be taken

'lightly,~neither should engagements.

When an expensive ring is involved, it might
be safestto spend extratime making sure you’re
giving it to, or taking it from, the right person.

ittsburgh has been on the national

stage a lot lately, whether for the

recent.“Most Livable City” rank-

ing by Forbes.com, our successful
sports teams or the Big Ben scandal. For a
smaller city, we have an impressive, pictur-
esque skyline —— one that’s the seemingly
default image when it comes to showing
off the city.

If you’re from the area, you know that

.some of Pittsburgh’s most vibrant, cultural

- and happening areas are found away from

the city’s center. And if you’re not, you’re
likely not as familiar with its personality-
packed, distinctive neighborhoods. Here’s
where the new website, pittsburghcityliv-
ing.com, could come in handy. It’s a site
that showcases Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods
and helps those moving to Pittsburgh ﬁnd

a suitable area to live.

Hopefully, Pittsburgh’s successes will
attract people to the area. But unless they
take a full-blown tour, they might miss out
on some of the city’s most exciting —-I and
most livable —- areas. Plus, Pittsburgh’s
image as a smoggy, steel city just won’t

blow over. That’s a very outdated image,‘

especially in the neighborhoods. We hope
the site will help curb these beliefs.
Actually going to neighborhoods is the
best way to check them out, but online
is the next best option. Although it’s in-

tended for new residents, the site could be,

equally helpful for new Pitt — or any area
college .——‘ students. Current students and
residents would probably learn a few new
things, too, and could adventure to some
new areas.

Columnist

 

I still remember the first few words my
high school teacher Ms. McCarthy said to
me after I found out I had been accepted
to Pitt, the words that came shortly after
“congratulations.” . I

They weren’t about the school or attrac-
tions of the big city. No, she talked about
the hills, the drivers and her adventures
navigating the city in the old stick shift
she had when she was college aged.

“If you can drive there, you can drive
anywhere,” she said.

Ain’t that the truth.

Each day that I make my commute to
work, I feel like I’m re-enacting the cli-
mactic chase scene from the classic Steve
McQueen movie “Bullitt.” My green beater
of a car substitutes for Frank Bullitt’s Mus-
tang, and everyone else on the road gets
to play the role of the baddie in the Dodge
Charger. ~ .

And just like Bullitt with the bad guys,
I fear for my life every time I have to share
the roads with Pittsburghers. Overall, I
don’t mind driving in Pennsylvania, but
there’s something — a lot of things, ac-
tually —— about Pittsburgh driving that
drives me crazy. I

Being from other

states can create

a college identity

Writer recognizes his Rhode Island roots

Abdul-Kareem Ahmed
Columnist

Coming to college means starting anew.
Whatever your reputation in high school,
you have the chance to rebuild it. But that
doesn’t mean reputations don’t exist in

' college too. We all have some little fact

or skill or trait that we’re known for in
residence halls and classroom chatter. You

~ could be that skateboarder, that writer, the

guy that’s always traveling or just about
anything. As for me, I’m the guy from
Rhode Island.

Growing up in Rhode Island was enjoy-
able. I was a few miles from the beach, and
everything was always close to home.

Coming to Pitt and going from quaint
suburbs to the hubbub of the city was a
major transition. _I quickly realized how
unusual it was to be from the Ocean State
and go to Pitt.

But I’ve started to appreciate this fact
and have since learned more about my
state. When you’re from as small a state,

‘you’ve got to know your territory.

Rhode Island has a peculiar history.

It was the ﬁrst state to declare indepen-
dence from Great Britain and the last to
ratify the Constitution. The first military
action against Britain occurredoff the
shores of Warwick, R.I., when Providence
residents sank the Gaspee, a British schoo-
ner. Indeed, Rhode Island has become
synonymous with rebellion.

Of course, Rhode Island is also the
smallest state, for which it is probably
most known. I’ve heard it being used as
a unit of measurement. I guess you can
estimate the area of a state by how many
Rhode Islands ﬁt into it. How long does

. it take to drive across the state? A half-

houn

What’s really funny to me is that some
people_don’t even know it exists. I’ve met
people from other states, and sometimes
when I tell them where I’m from, I have to
explain that it’s one of the 50 states. Sure,
that’s rare, but it still happens. “Family
Guy” has popularized Rhode Island in
recent years, though Quahog, R.I., isn’t
real.

The state also has some random quali-
ties. For one, the Environmental Working
Group, an organization aimed at protect-
ing public health and environment, ranked
Providence as the second best city for

water quality this year. _ _ .

Every state has its highs and lows and
its quirky history and qualities. I.’m lucky
enough to get to ‘experience both Rhode
Island and Pennsylvania, particularly
Pittsburgh.

Pitt is in the midst of the city, and that
gives it some advantages. I

The large UPMC system permeates the
campus and holds a lot of opportunity

for pre_-health students. Additionally, the

public transportation system is strong
and convenient. Where I live in Rhode
Island, there isn’t much like what Pitt’s
campus offers. ‘

Then again, Rhode Island has more
green than Pittsburgh — and I mean more
grass and parks. Schenley Plaza,‘ Schenley
Park and the Cathedral lawn are about all
of the grass I know to exist in the general

66

There’s a welcoming
sense about my state, I
because it’s what Pm n
known for in college.

99

area..Back at home, there’s an open space
of turf every few blocks.

Inevitably, each place haslits advan-
tages and disadvantages. I’m still from
Rhode Island and always will be that guy
while I’m at Pitt — and I love it.

If you’re a talented skateboarder, then
don’t give it up.

If you write beautifully, continue. It’s-
a strength or characteristic of yours that
you’ve acquired or inherited. As you’re
probably known for one quality or another
in college, why not embrace that identity
rather than try to escape it? That is, if
it’s a positive characteristic. It’s a way of
bringing identity to us students at a school
as massive as Pitt.

1 always love coming home. There’s a
welcoming sense about my state, because
it’s what I’m known for in college. Last
fact: Rhode Island’s state bird is a chicken.
Beat that.

Turn signals‘ not an option  

 driving made coniplicated‘by uj1iiuritten=A ‘rules ’

Brown< 5 '

Motorists in Pittsburgh adhere to a differ-
ent set of laws than the rest of the state.
The differences could be attributed to
Pittsburgh’s old infrastructure, narrow
roads and navigational challenges, com-
plemented by hundreds of bridges. But
there’s a lot more to it than that.

. Take the “Pittsburgh Left” for instance,
otherwise known as “Right of way? What’s
that?’-’ The processinvolves racing against
oncoming traffic to make a left as soon as
therlight turns green — sort of like Frog-
ger with a car. ' . I

Its prevalence is now largely driving
lore, though it does, have a Wikipedia ar-
ticle devoted to explaining its intricacies.
And it’s just the way you’re supposed to
drive apparently. ~

The first time I.witnessed a Pittsburgh
Left, I was forced to stop midway through
an intersection, slamming on my brakes
out of necessity and awe. Why wasn’t I ever

taught something so useful back home in

suburbia?

When moving a little slower, such as
during rush hour on Fifth Avenue, differ-
ent rules apply. If you’re on the same road
as a driver who needsto change lanes,
it’s important to cut him off, ignore turn
signals — real Pittsburghers don’t use
them anyway — and then proceed. to
honk incessantly to demonstrate your
machismo. ' _

The uniquedriving behavior in __Pitt_s—
burgh could possibly be attributed to the
city’s lack of an interstate beltway, leaving
its two main interstates heavily crowded.
Perhaps Pittsburghers are simply accus-
tomed to not being able to get anywhere

_ quickly. Nor can they get there very ef-
ficiently, because the alternative to the A

interstates consists of a circuitous colored

belt system around the city. That’s why '
they say, “You can’t get from there to here ‘

in Pittsburg .”' . _

At highway speeds, proper etiquette
seems to dictate that the left lane isn’t
a passing lane. Rather, it’s a moseying
lane designed for drivers to pull along-
side those right of them to check out the
Steelers and Pens garb glued onto their

dashboards.

After sitting in a left lane waiting for
the driver ahead of me to switch lanes on
several occasions, I began to notice what’s

popular these days —— mostly gold—and— _

black beads hanging on rearview mirrors
and miniature Stanley Cups rightunder

, them. When you can’t face Heinz Field or

Mellon Arena ﬁve times a day to pray, I
guess the dashboard is the next best op-

, tion.

. On the highway, much like in slower
driving, changing lanes is a task best com-
pleted without turn signals across multiple
lanes at once. Only girly men and those
with poorupjbringings use signals, so it’s
best toavoid any unnecessary wear on the
turn signal stalk. . - j

And when all of the moving is said and
done, parking should be done wherever
there’s room, evidenced by the battle scar
on my car’s rear bumper. But I didn’t need

_ that paint on my car anyway.

\ Real men forge their own parking

. spaces. It’s every man for himself.

Because the city was built before the
invention of automobiles, many residenc-
es are without driveways, leaving their
inhabitants to fend forstreet parking.

This. past winter highlighted this diffi- “
culty, as residents attempted to lay claim .

to parking spaces by planting chairs on

the curb Vinlfront of their houses. Mov- ,

ing these placeimarkers evens resulted in
some creative forms of vengeance. As the
Pittsburgh Channel reported, a. car was
left buried under an avalanche during the
recent Snowpocalypse after the driver

‘ presumably moved a chair and stole the

spot. On top of the covered car in ques-
tion, the owner found a note that read,

“Now yinz know not to break the rules.” I

Classy, very classy. . .
After driving here fortwo years, now,

1 I’ve given up on trying to understan_d all of

the absurd little unwritten "rules. There’s
no point in trying to make sense of it. .

I just go with the flow — turn signals
or not.

Bethie tries to answer the question, hownmuch skin is too much

Bethie Girmai
Staﬂ’ Writer

We’ve all seen them — the hal-
ter tops that accentuate a girl’s
back fat, the low rise cutoffs that
expose that muffin-top and the
midriff bearing tank tops embla-
zoned with something like “sexy
mama.” .

It can’t be denied, summer at-
tire can be tricky and hemlines
have a tendency of rising with the
temperature.

The truth is that most of us
aren’t built like supermodels, so
skimpy clothes just aren’t right for
some people. For clothes to really
work, sometimes it’s more impor-

tantto dress to ﬂatter your body
shape rather than your dream
body.

Soif you ﬁnd something from
Dolce and Gabbana’s summer col-
lection that catches your eye, but
isn’t appropriate for work —- or
anything for that matter — ﬁnd
a cheaper alternative that in-
corporates certain details of the
outﬁt. . .

There are certain items a girl
should always invest in when the

seasons transition from- spring to

summer. These staples will guide
you through the summer and hold
over your shopping needs well
into the fall. ‘

First, we’ll tackle the shorts.

Every girl should have a pair of
white, khaki and denim shorts to

' wear in the summer. When you go

out to purchase said items, there
are some guidelines to take into
consideration.

For white, shorts, look for a

. pair that is thick enough so no one

will spy your days—of-the-week
underwear, but airy enough that
you won’t suffocate in the sum-
mer heat.

Khakis are great because there
is no wrong way to wear them
— unless they’re too short. Any
shade of khaki is acceptable be-
cause it’s such a versatile color,

THEATER '

otheuo takes

P|CT’s

V Alison Smyth‘

Staﬁ"Writer

About 400 years after it was
written, the Shakespearean play
“Othello” was featured in more
than 60 theaters throughout the
country. This week, it will come
to campus in a production put on
by Pitt’s Pittsburgh Irish and Clas-
sical Theatre.

“Now, I don’t know how that
connects with Obama,” said An-
drew S. Paul, the_ play’s director
and the co—founder- of PICT. “In a
lot of ways, I don’t think it does.

' But it is interesting that the year

Obama got elected, there was
something like 62 productions
of ‘Othello’ in American Theatre

. magazine. On an average year,

there might be 15. People jump to
the idea that now we can do a play
about race because we have a black
president,” Paul said.

The play follows Othello, a
Moorish general in the Venetian

,. _ V Army, as he falls_in,love with, and .. .
 ». _, then whisks away, Desdemona. Vil-

li an Iago, who works for Othello,

hatc a plan to make it look like
. his own _  1, Cassie, is having an

rts and summer styles

opposite of such a pair. Cutoffs are
far from ﬂattering.

Here are a few rules for suc-
cessfully wearing jorts: No jeans
shorts with frayed hems! The only
exception are jorts with a longer
hem. If the shorts run longer,
frayed hems are acceptable. Fur-
thermore, jorts should beslightly
looser than most other shorts,
because the fabric is so heavy. J.
Crew makes a great pair that falls
mid-thigh, is double-cuffed and
has a destroyed look. Finally, the
No. 1 rule of shorts is to,err on
the side of caution when it comes
to length. .

The next itemsareopen to in

terpretation, because there are so .

stage

affair with Desdemona. After sev-
eral plot twists and a misplaced
handkerchief, four characters die
in true Shakespearean fashion.

1 Paul said Javon Johnson, who
plays Othello in the PICT produc-
tion, captures the title character
physically and psychologically.

“ [Johnson] has a lithe, panther-
like presence. He’s very quick on

his feet too, for a big guy. He’s .

about 6 foot 1, 240 — he’s like
a fullback, but [Othello]’s also a
beautiful speaker and, for the most
part, a very reasonable, rational
human being in a way that almost
no one else in the play really is,”
he said.

Iago’s irrational motives are in-
ﬂuenced by more than just race,
although Othello’s feeling of “oth—
emess” is an important element in
the play, Paul said.

.“I think it’s much more about
the fact that this guy is not only
black, but is also his boss. [Othello]

passed him over for a promotion 

that he really wanted, and the guy

. that got the job is sort of a pretty

boy,” he said.

sure you have alight Sundress for

Invest in a pair of rain boots for

Always have a white Oxford shirt

Pornographers make

While Neko Case is a known collaboration

with The New Pornographers, as is dem-
onstrated on its new album Togetber.

A decade into The New Pornographers’
reign as an indie superstar, fans have come
to expect great things from the band, and

its new album doesn’t disappoint. It isn’t ’

particularly standout among its impres-
sive discography, but it’s without a doubt
a worthy addition to the collection.
Together sticks to the jaunty, j angly and
upbeat songs that the band is known for.

7 But throughoutthefcourse of.the album,

more songs than usual are a little morose
but by no means disappointing. Some of
the album’s most notable tracks are “Crash
Years” and “If You Can‘See My Mirrors,”
with a track or two like “Daughters of Sor-
row” being slightly less catchy.

The New Pornographers welcomed a
few extra additions, like St. Vincent’s An-
nie Clark, Beirut’s Zach Condon and Will
Sheff from Okkervil River, to collaborate
on Toget/yer, and it proved to work well for
the group.

To be honest, after The National released

low voice of lead singer Matt Berninger

carrying each song over quick beats and

mellow instrumentals. The most distinct

difference is that the new album has a sort .

of lo—ﬁ, ethereal quality that fans haven’t
heard before. '

The most striking aspect of the album
is how real The Nationa1’s songs are.

They’re not about extraordinary cir-
cumstances or rnind—boggling love. They’re
about drugs, real «relationships and coping
with everyday life. '

So while it’s tough to debate whether
Hzg/2 Violet topped The National’s other

Othello ( 7

Race still matters in

400 years after Shakespeare, Othello is still relevant

The pretty boy, Cassid, and Othello’s wife,
Desdemona, fall victim to Iago’s plot, even
if Iago’s original intention was only to foil
Othello. , .

Ironically, Jay Stratton and Allison Mc-
Lemore, who play the suspected lovers, are
actually married.

Contrary to their current roles, their own

‘lives sometimes readcloser to comedy than
. tragedy. Stratton searched for an engage-

ment ring for McLemore by slipping out to
shops secretly with one of her friends.

-“I remember thinking that this could
be the beginning of a really great play by
Shakespeare or a really tedious sitcom,”
Stratton said.

The play “Othello” is more dramatic,
although it sometimes resembles real life
more than TV shows or ﬁlms do. ,

“It all seems very plausible in the two and
a half hours in the theater, but I think if you
take the time to digest this as a sequence
of events you’d ﬁnd it very implausible. But
then, if you ever watch these true crime
shows like ‘48 Hours,’ it always seems im-
plausible,” Paul said. “This is how murders
happen.” A V

Some of the lesson from “Othello” can
be carried over into real life.

“If your best friend comes up to you and

V says, ‘Hey man, I think maybe your wife

is running around,’ it’s never going to be
good news. But it can behoove you to not
say,_ ‘Well, then you must be lying to me,
3t.1‘at1?9I1S3id-_. ..   .  
“But it could also behoove you to go ask
your wife,” McLemore said.
Through her role asDesdemona, McLem-

ore learned “what can be gained from being

9” '

forthright, from trying your best to look at
a circumstance for what it is and keeping
your doubtful mind quiet enough to look at
a situation for what it is,” she said. ‘

The truth of the situation in “Othello,” of
course, is a difficult and tragic one.

“It’s very harrowing experience for the
audience and it’s, at times, a very unwatch-
able play because we don’t want to see it
happen,” he said. “That makes it, in a twisted
way, equivocally compelling theater.” .

Quoting Chicago actor Harry Lennix,
Paul said that it’s impossible for a black actor
to successﬁilly play the part of Othello be-
cause the character is a white man’s fantasy
of what it means to be black.

“There’s a lot of truth in that. Clearly
Shakespeare wouldn’t have known black
people. He may have come across a few in
his life, but he wouldn’t have had friends
who were black or have had any context for
writing a black character that would be in
touch with his culture,” Paul said.

Shakespeare scholar Stephanie Thomp-
son spoke about the play at Pitt last year,
citing a‘ Peter Sellers production with John
Ortiz, a Latino actor in the titlerole and an
Obarnalook—alike as the Duke. The produc-
tion was terrible without the race element,

. Paul said.

Othello faced challenges from the Vene-
tian citizens speciﬁcally as a black man.
“They didn’t really think of him as a Chris-

tian, even though he probably convert[ed] to
j ,ma_rr_'ygDesdernona_.,They consiglered.him a

Muslim. There is a strong sense of complete
isolation there, and yet he’s in a position of
authority in a culture that’s not his own.” i

Pitt hires another coach

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

The Pitt women’s basketball team hired

..its second assistant coach in two weeks T

when it announced the hiring of Khadija

_Head on Monday. - .

The hiring of Head, who had worked as
an assistant coach and recruiting coordi-
nator at Middle Tennessee State since the
2007 season, comes just one week after the
team hired assistant Patty Coyle.

Head helped lead Middle Tennessee to

consecutive NCAA Tournament appear- '

ances the last two seasons as well as a top-
25 recruiting class in 2009. She brought
in two NJCAA All-Americans in 2008 after
helping recruit Kansas Gatorade Player of
the Year Morgan Boyd the prior year. -
She has recruiting ties in southern
states, which will allow the Panthers to ac-
tively recruit players they might not have

previously had a chance to bring in.

“I’m originally from the South,” Head
said. “So I have a lot of connections with
the high school coaches as well with the
AAU coaches.”

‘Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato said

. Head completes the staff and gives it bal-

ance going into this season.

1 “She has a professional skill level and a
very motivational personality that I believe
will relate very well to the student~athletes
here at Pitt and those we look to bring in,”
Berenato said in a press release.

Head has high hopes for the program
and is excited to get to work. ’

“I’m just going to get in with that staff,
hopefully bring in a top—10 recruiting
class, put together a great group of young

. ladies on the court to get usiback to the

NCAA Tournament and compete for a Big
East title,” Head said.

‘TRACK AND FIELD .

Women sucee
men falter ,

Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

The women’s track and ﬁeld team placed

fourth out of nearly 50 teams last week-

end, whereas the men were hindered by

injuriesf But everyone will‘have to wait

until Friday to know exactly where they’
stand going forward for the rest of the

season.

The new format for the NCAA Regional
Championship — which features only
two regions instead of four —— does not
have qualifying standards. Instead, the
top 48 athletes in each event qualify for
the regional competition.

Head coach Alonzo Webb said that
there are six Panthers who should be in-
vited‘, whereas several others are on the
bubble.

Last weekend, the Panthers traveled
to Princeton, NJ, where the ‘men com-
peted in the Intercollegiate Association of
Amateur Athletes of America Champion-
ships (IC4A), and the women competed in
the Eastern College Athletic Conference
Championships (ECAC). The women took
fourth, while the men stumbled into 41st
place dueto injuries. » I

“The idea wasn’t to do well as a team,”
Webb ‘said. ‘_‘We were just trying to im-
prove individual performances. Since the
regionals are different, our focus was dif-
ferent than in the past.” -

“The women just so happened to ﬁnish
in fourth,” he said.

Both the men and women had 15 quali-
ﬁers for last weekend’s meet, but several
men couldn’t compete because of injuries,
as only eight men ﬁnished their races or
posted scores in their events.

The m_en’s 4x800-meter relay team
had the second fastest qualifying time,
but could not run.

both Wait

'-3

Still, Webb said he was -surprised at 4

how well some of the men did, notably
Folarin Ijelu, who was coming off a ham-
string injury and earned sixth in the triple
jump. «

“I was surprised he did as well as he
did,” Webb said. “Garrett Larkin had his
season best and Tashaun Hill had his per-
sonal best.”

Hill took seventh in the 110 hurdles
earning the Panthers two team points.
Ijelu earned three points with his sixth

place ﬁnish and Jermaine Lowery tool?

eighth in the 400-meter hurdles to earn '
one point for the team. '

The women’s track team finished in
the top eight in seven different events, ‘

including Da’Lynn Mills in the 200 and -

the 4x100 relay team, which consisted of
Ashley Woodford, Mills, Jonnique Law-
rence and Cambryajones. '

Mills also took fourth in the 100, and
Jones took ﬁfth and sixth in the 100 and
200, respectively. Brianna Broyles took
fourth in the 400 hurdles, and Rachae;
McIntosh ‘took third in the heptathlon.

This meet marks the end of the season
for many Panthers, while some await invi-
tations to the NCAA Regional Champion-
ships, which takes place Memorial Day
weekend-in Greensboro, N.C.- .
' Webb said he expects Broyles,_]ones,
Mills and the 4x100 relay team to qualify
for the women and Lowery for the men.
But there are ﬁve others that are on the
bubble. Dontave Cowsette, Ijelu, Hill and
McIntosh are on the maybe list.

“Overall, I think it’s been an up~and5s
down season because of injuries and
youth,” Webb said. “Right now, we’re just
hoping to qualify for N.C. We’re excited
to get these next two weeks of practice
started.”

Pitt wins series
against Cincinnati

The Panthers are only 1 game behind fLrst— place Connecticut

Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ' Writer

It’s hunting season. ,
By taking two of three games from Big
East opponent Cincinnati, the Pitt baseball
team remains on the prowl for the regu-
lar season conference title, now just one
game behind the ﬁrst place Connecticut
Huskies.

The two Pitt wins in the weekend series
were dominated by impressive offensive
production and consistent pitching, and it
showed in the 12-2 and 8-5 ﬁnal scores.

In the team’s 12-2 rout, junior pitcher
Corey Baker turned in a complete game
performance, giving up just seven hits to
earn his 11”‘ victory.’ '

“Baker was great,” head coach JoeJor—
dano said. “We needed a complete game
out of him, and he delivered big time.
He always competes hard and gives us a
chance to win.” 5

Baker’s work from the mound allowed
the Panther offense to emerge, with junior
John Schultz leading the way. ,

Schultz finished the series opening
game with two hits in three at—bats and
also drove in three of the Panthers’ 12
runs.

“Schultz is a very solid and consistent
player and a very unselﬁsh hitter,” Jor-
dano said.

In addition to his two hits, Schultz also

managed to draw three walks, a statistic .

that Jordano values greatly.

“Schultz broke the single-season re-
cord for walks this year, which proves
what a great eyeihe has and his willingness
to be patient’ at the plate,” Jordano said.
“That record is not as heralded as some
other offensive records, but it is certainly
of equal importance.”

The second game against the Bearcats
resulted in the 10th victory for Pitt sopho-

more pitcher Matt Iannazzo, who went six '

and two-thirds innings.

The Panthers’ relief pitching was strong
in the game, as J.R. Leonardi completed
two innings of scoreless work, and Joe
Leonard closed out the victory in the ninth
inning. ,

Leonard, a junior pitcher, set another
Pitt record: the single-season record for
saves with eight, while also contributing
two hits and three RBIs on offense.

“Leonard is a special player,” Jordano
said. “He has been great for us at the plate
and on the mound.”

With the second win of the series, the
Panthers earned their 17“‘ Big East victory
of the year, matching the most conference

wins in the team’s history. A

But the third and ﬁnal game against
Cincinnati did not add to that total, asthe
Panthers fell to the Bearcats 3-1.

2 The one run produced by the Panther
offense was a season low and one Jorda-
no attributes to outstanding opposing
pitcher. ;

“Our offense was solid in games one
and two, but we ran into a hot pitcher in
Andrew Strenge,”Jordano said. “He did
the same thing to Connecticut last week-
end in a 3-2 complete game, and he was
good again today.” .

Leonardi was credited with the loss
after conceding two runs on two hits in
his relief effort in the eighth inning. 5

Freshman pitcher Alex Caravella made
his-third start of the season for Pitt and
gave up only one run while striking out
four batters. . 2

Even Schultz’s 3-for-4 performance
at the plate could not generate the runs
needed to overcome the two-run deﬁcit
as the Panthers failed to record the sweep
of the Bearcats.

66

Anyone on this team will tell
you we are not done yet and
have a lot more to prove.

9?

joejordano

Despite less offensive plays in the ﬁnal
game of the series,Jordano noted that the
situation was not cause for panic.

“Basically, the game came down to one

*pitch in the eighth inning, and Cincinnati
delivered with a two-run double,”Jordano
said. “I think that shows how special this
team has been at the plate allseason and
that coach Lopaze and coach Leahy have
done a great job with, our offense.”

The Panthers (36-14, 17-6 BigtEast)
have one conference series remaining
against the South Florida Bulls at home
this weekend before they advance to the
Big East tournament. 1

“We are very pleased with our season

-thus far, and our club has competed well

in the conference,” Jordano said. “Our
players have worked very_hard and have
stayed very focused. Anyone on this team
willtell you we are not done yet and have
a lot more left to prove.”
