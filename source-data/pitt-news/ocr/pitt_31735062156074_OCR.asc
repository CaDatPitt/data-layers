Goldmann and his committee

in price resulted.

' - The 16 people who have bought

tickets for the game may either
pay two dollars at the Student
Desk for a new ticket or return
their tickets and have ‘ their

. Oldest Tradition

The Lantern Night ceremony is
the oldest of Pitt traditions, hav-
ing ﬁrsttaken place in 1921. The
lanterns given the freshmen are
replicas of ‘the ones used at the
time of the founding of-the Uni-.
versity, while the lighting ‘of the
flame symbolizes to each fresh-
man her beginning in the search
for the light of truth.

Parents and friends of fresh-
men are invited to «view the cere-
mony from the balconies of Foster

Memorial and the Commons
Room. ’

been refused is a disturbing situ-

l ation,” but he stressed‘ that “more

information may give cause for
City Council to give the problem
more consideration.”

“It is my hope that city council
will give the panthers fair con-
sideration,’’ he added, “However,
I do appreciate their concern for
the safety of the citizens.”

Council Fears Scare

City Council outlawed the pan-
thers because someone would be
“scared to death.” Whether it
would be the people or the pan-
thers is the question they have not
decided.

Since then, Dean Biddle has
written a letter to Mayor David L.
Lawrence. He pointed _out that the
University has gone ahead in the
matter, and that the panthers have
already been officially dedicated,
in the ‘presence of the Mayor and
the Chancellor of the University.

Cage Strong Enough

Zoo officials‘ have assured Coun-
cil that the cage which was pre-
pared for the panthers by the
Alpha Phi Omega fraternity is
strong enough to hold th_e animals.

Dean Biddle said, however, tha
the zoo officials and the mayor
cannot be held accountable for the
state of the situation. He reas-
serted that_the ﬁnal word ,rests
;with Council.

While it is the fashion nowadays to cry’ out _

a number of’ professions. The medical profession

owes its tremendous prestige
partly to strict licensing of doc-
tors which has set up high stand-
ards for the profession as a
whole. ‘- '

Naturally‘ the. profession
which would have the most con-

to it would be the one where
the state acts as employer, the

In order to'get a certiﬁcate to teach, in. the
‘public schools the student must wade through as-
sorted courses in methods, theory, etc.

Semester of Teaching

The culmination of this work is a semester of
student’ teaching during which the ‘new teacher is
observed all semester by a critic teacher and at in-
tervals by asupervisor. ‘Each week- there are two
one-hour conferences ‘with twolsupervisors.

Being a guinea pig can be very rewarding-—a guinea

Under a_’Fulbright scholarship, Dr. George B. Fowler,

museums and monasteries on the
trail of aiBenedictine abbott.

Dr.-Fowler was on the trail of
Engelbert of Admont, an abbott
of, the 14th -century who recorded
much of his teachings and philo-
sophy, still applicable today. E_n—
gelbert has been called “the great-

Italy, where Englebert lived for

Cain Visiitorsis

By -Cathedral/1 rchitecture

By JOAN" BLACK
This summer‘ 179 foreign visitors from 33 countries tour-

ed the University. Many had

heard of Pitt through its Na-

tionality Rooms before coming, but to many others the ex-
istence of the Cathedral of Learning was unknown.

A group of Swiss architects from:

Zurich who annually tour the
United States had allotedonly one
day "of their journey to seeing
Pittsburgh. They were so im-
pressed with the Cathedral that
they made plans to spend at least
ﬁve days here next summer.

This attitude’ is reflected over
and over again, according to Miss
Madlyn Martucci, assistant to the
dean of women in charge of the in-
foimation room. “Most visitors
from overseas ‘think of Pittsburgh

~ as merely an industrial center.

They are constantly amazed at the
city’s cultural aspects,” Miss Mar-
tucci said. _
Diplomats Here
Some of the visitors this sum-
mer included the Yugoslavian
consul-general, the director of the
Malayan motion picture industry,
the Cuban athletic commissioner,
besides many other diplomats, stu-

dents, and private citizens from

overseas. '

Sparked by the accurate throw-
ing arm of Bud Spangler, who
tossed six touchdown passes,
Sigma Chi trounced Theta Chi,
47-6, for its second straight vic-
tory. ~

The spirited Sigs, 1951 champs
of the interfraternity league, con-
sistently bafﬁed the Thetas with

their smooth oﬁense.

Spangler jumped off to a quick
start in the ﬁrst quarter. when
he hit Don, Clark, ’51 intramural
all-star end, for- the ﬁrst six-
pointer. Bud then lobbed an easy
spiral to Tom Blosser for the ex-
tra point that clinched a victory.

Late in the same stanza Herk

Harriers Open

Today Against '

Westminster

Coach Carl Olson’s 1952
cross country team swings in-
to action today and tomorrow,
facing Westminster and Geneva in
its ﬁrst two dual meets.

Today’s race begins at 4 p.m.
and tomorrow’s at 11 a.m. Both
races will be run over the scenic
Schenley Park courses. _

Olson has selected Captain Ber-
nie Luterancik, Don Delli Gatti,
Dick Weber, Dan Sommer, Ron
Sallade, Don Doyle, and Chuck
Wivel as his seven starters.

However, Olson hopes -to obtain
permission from the Westminster
coach to run the entire squad in
today’s meet-so they can get some
experience in competition.

In this way, if anyone who is

not a starter runs well against "

Westminster, Olson can place him

among the starters in tomorrow’s '

encounter.

Next Saturday, the harriers will
compete against annually strong
Ohio State in the ﬁrst of a home-
and—home series.

The Blue‘-and-“Gold took six of
seven dual meets last year, win-
ning theﬁnal ﬁve. The only loss
was inﬂicted early in the season
by Penn State at State College.

The ﬁrst four contests for the
harriers will be at home and the
remaining four on the road. *

no slouch in the record column,
either, with 46 wins against six
losses since he took over four» sea-
sons ago. Wilkinson played under
Dawson while the latter coached
at Minnesota in 1935.

Red. 3.... Predict
Only Fair Seasons

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
Sports Editor

  

Like Bud Wilkinson, athletic director and head coach
at Oklahoma, Red Dawson wraps the turbin around his
thinning mop and prognostigates _about his team’s chances.

Dawson took a crack at itbefore fall drills began and

» ﬂatly stated ‘that the great teams aren’t built around sopho-

he said, “if there has ever
been a great football team
 °“'°“"“" comprised predominantly of
s‘ophornore talent.

“It’s the seniors and
juniors who carrya team
—if it’s going to be tough.”
Dawson, unfortunately,
ﬁelds an overweighted so-
phomore squad and de-

 — pends on the second-year

. 9'" men to carry the load.

Sticking to his theory, then, he predicts a rough season
ahead. One which should ﬁnd his gridders taking plenty of
licks but “giving everyone a helluva ﬁght.”

The rough stuﬁ will ‘start tomorrow with Oklahoma,
followed by a strong Notre Dame team -and Army, a “sleeper
in the East.” Ohio State, too, is on the schedule and, al-
though Dawson doesn’t come right out and says it, his Pan-
thers could lose these four quite easily. 0

Surprisingly Wilkinson isn’t over-optimistic either.
In fact, considering his excellent teams that have ‘never
lost a Big Seven conference game since 1947, he’s crying.

“Kansas will be the best team in the Big Seven in 1952,”
he predicts. “Colorado should be second. Nebraska, Okla-
homa, and the others will follow in a third group.” ‘

His report card so far is A. Kansas hasn’t played a con-
ference game as yet but they have defeated opponents on
two successive weekends. Colorado tied the Sooners last

mores. “I doubt very much,”

  

~ week, 21-21.

It might be that by bowl time the Sooners will be
a lowly third in the conference standings.
