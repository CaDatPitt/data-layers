Bus Strike Binds Commuters State Colleges’ Students

BY MONICA A. CIROCCO

The Port Authority Transit (PAT)
employee strike, involving the
walkout of 2,600 bus and trolley
operators at midnight Sunday, has
forced 330,000 daily commuters to
find alternative means of transpor-
tation.

State law requires that the county
employees and the Authority take
any ‘contract disagreements into
binding arbitration and prohibits

members of Division 85 of the
Amalgamated Transit Union voted
overwhelmingly to walk out.

Since the walkout, the employees
have ignored both'a temporary
restraining order and a court
injunction issued by Allegheny
County Judge Richard Wentley,
and a request to return to work
from union officials. ,

Despite the strike. city schools,
colleges and universities remain
open. leaving thousands of
students.-who depend on PAT
services, in a difficult position.
This includes the majority of 65
percent of Pitt’s student body.

In view of this fact. Provost
Rhoten A. Smith issued a state-

ment Monday concerning adminis-
tration considerations during the

strike.
Students are urged to “make all
reasonable efforts to attend

classes, but if transportation,
problems prevent ‘attendance. in- V
structors should be informed.

“Faculty .members who have
commuters in their classes may
wish to make reasonable schedule
changes responsive to student
needs created by this situation.
“Certainly no student should be
penalized or prevented from
making up work which was
interrupted by this serious trans-
portation problem."

HARRISBURG AP--Some 2,000
students repeatedly jeered Educa-
tion Secretary John C. Pittenger as
he addressed their rally Tuesday
for better funding of state-owned
colleges.

Representing campus govern-
ments from the 14 state’ in-
stitutions, the students jammed the
Capitol steps to hear from their
own leaders and government
officials.

were slim that striking bus and
trolley operators would end their
crippling walk-out today following
a dramatic rank-and-file meeting in
which all eleven members of the
union's executive board resigned.
Some l.500~of 1,700 members of
Division 85. Amalgamated Transit
Union
shouts and comments Tuesday
night that they wouldn't show up
for work for the third straight day

unless they have a contract.
However. no formal vote was
taken.

‘The union’s executive board
resigned one by one at the meeting
rather than be placed
position of endorsing an appeal by
union officers to return to work.

The four officers did not resign.
The mass meeting at Soldiers and
Sailors Hall in Oakland followed a
day of legal action in Allegheny
Common Pleas Court that included
the threat of criminal contempt
charges against the union if it did
not abide by a court order to return
to V w or k .
to work.

But union members seemed ready
to accept drastic consequences.

“The majority said they would go
to jail en masse before they would
go to work without a contract."
said Joseph Pass, the union's legal
counsel.

Pass also asked the union
members to return to work and he
explained what legal action could
be taken against the union if they
didn't.

But he was constantly interrupted
by boos and catcalls.

county's public transit. Judge
Richard T. Wentle-y took these

Boycott Slicing‘ Former Profit

BY LARRY PLATT

The lettuce and grape boycott has cost the Coachella
Valley (California) farmers !5 million in investment
money according to Cesar Chavez

Speaking yesterday at a Pittsburgh press
conference, the leader of the United Farm Workers
[UFW] said the effects of the boycott have varied, but
on the whole, “it has kept growers from making any
profit and if it goes another year, it will cut into their
investment.”

Requesting that people not buy grapes, non-union
iceberg lettuce and Gallo wine, Chavez predicted “If
the boycott continues going the way it is, I expect the
growers will make up their minds no later than
April." ,

The growers must decide if they will renew their
contracts with UFW or replace them with the
Teamsters.

The,UFW, explained Chavez, “has been fighting
the Teamsters since the beginning of the
movement.” When asked about an apparent
agreement with the Teamsters Union this summer
which later fell through, Chavez answered, “It could
have been a gimmick to get them past the‘ AFL-CIO’s
convention without being condemned.”

the students verbally jumped- on
Pittenger the moment he was
introduced and frequently inter-
rupted his remarks.

Parts of Pittenger’s impromptu
address were critical of the
students. ‘

“You need, in addition to this
demonstration, a permanent pre-
sence in Harrisburg,” he said. ‘l‘I

leaders of state college government
associations to do this.
suggest that you talk in terms of
establishing an office” to bring
pressures on government leaders.

Pittenger then commented--to a
chorus of boos--such an office
would be less expensive than the

cost of bringing 2,000 students to '

Harrisburg.

Earlier,’ a House Democratic
leader said the state should offer
free higher education.

“We ought to institute free
public education....right straight
through to ‘graduate school if

necessary,” said Rep. K. Leroy:

lrvis, the minority whip.

“Unless we change the trend, we
are going to put the state college
system out of business. If we_do,’

we'll be turning education over to
the‘ private enterprise boys, and 
' that would be disastrous. ‘

“We are still equating the. dollar

with education. It’s still left to the '

pocketbooks of the father or mother
as to who gets the best education,
and that's wrong." .

Attack underserved, speaker says

Academia Sells Bad Business Image

BY RICHARD SWARTZ

A “spineless” American
business community has apparent-
ly been made the victim of an
“undeserved attack” by certain
segments of society, according to
the Chairman of the Board of
Bethany College.

Dr. Perry Graham, a featured
speaker at a University business
seminar last Saturday, said the

towards major corporations lies in
the “pervasive” influence of such
academicians as Karl Marx, C.
Wright Mills, and John Kenneth
Galbraith.

He described the average
-businessman today as a “belea-
guered individual who has re-
sponded to these attacks with a
failure of nerve and has suffered
the loss of his self-respect as a
result. _

“He has been criticized from
seven different quarters, for
reasons which he can hardly be
held responsible," Graham told the
“The environ-
mentalists, the consumer crusa-
ders, the publicists, scholars,
politicians, intellectuals, and trade
unionists--all have been attacking
the businessman of late.

“Galbraith calls him part of the

new ‘tech-no-structure elite’ who
operate on the most important level
of international relations."

THE MARRY-G0-WRONG

The “warlords" notion can be
traced to the writings of C. Wright
Mills, Graham claimed, since it
was one of Mills’s “widely-
circulated books” that first intro-
duced the concept of a military-
industrial complex. He also
criticized Marx for “still causing
trouble in the world today” and
said his philosophy has become
ﬁrmly ensconced in the academic
environment of the nation's uni-
versities.

“These people have the crack of
doom sounding around their ears,”
noted Graham, referring to critics
of the corporate interest.” The
ecologists, for instance, are more
concerned with attacking business
than they are with cleaning up the
land, sea, or air.

“I'd only like to be in one place
with Ralph Nader, and that's at the
pearly gates, because when St.
Peter tells him to go to hell, then
he'll have to go. Mr. Nader's not
my most admired friend.”

A substantial amount of mis-
information is present in textbooks,
Graham alleged, particularly in the
fields of political economy and
philosophy. He accused teachers
of having been seduced by the
trade unionist mentality found in
such works, and said students are

of the same temper as their
instructors “generally".
He also censured the

"publicists” and members of the

“What they don't understand is
that a rational answer is not the
answer that's needed," contended
Graham. a former philosophy
professor.

“We've got a political problem,
because what the republic is about
is justice--having and doing what is
one's_ own is provided for us in the
Constitution. Businessman must
show the people the failure of
government to solve__ their pro-
blenis."

‘ He characterized the public’s
relationship with Washington as a
“false love affair” ‘and maintained
the bureaucracy of Government is
far more difficult to deal with than
the bureaucracy of a corporation.
However, Graham added, “Our,
government’s done better than

’ most.”

A strategy for the corporate
man's survival in the midst of such
an “assault" was submitted before
the audience as a “line of
defense". Graham implored
businessmen to impute more
honesty and social responsibility
into their work and to develop their

popular image as “servants of the ,

The measure wold prohibit sale or
distribution of allegedly
“obscene” material when:

--“The average person, applying
contemporary community
standards. would find that the
subject matter taken as a whole
appeals to the prurient interest.”
Juries hearing individual cases
would decide the standards in each
instance. '

--“The subject matter depicts or

way, ultimate sexual acts, normal

All three criteria wold have to be
met, in a jury's opinion, for a
finding that certain material is
obscene. The.district attorneys in

If the district attorney obtains a

Before sending the bill to the
House floor, the committee reject-
ed a proposal by Rep. Marvin
Miller, R-Lancaster, seeking to

apply the prohibition on sales to .

minors rather than adults.

Miller indicated he would offer
the proposal again on the House
floor.

Current state law bans sales of
obscene material to adults, but
deﬁnes obscene according topthe
old legal guidelines that the
Supreme Court voided in its
opinions on pornography earlier
this year.

The energy crisis may mean
turning down the heat or foregoing
Christmas lights, but for Thomas
Pawlak it means a deﬁnite and
not-too-voluntary cutback in the
gasoline—and-service business he's

been building for 18 years.
Pawlak is the Gulf Oil dealer at
Centre Avenue and Millvale Street,

 across the street from Haddon Hall
' Hotel. A no-nonsense man with

a kindly smile. he is also manager
of one of the company’s official
dealer-training centers. There's
not a huge demand for that line of
work today.

i _ Out of seven service stations from

Centre Avenue to Forbes, only
three were selling gasoline by mid-

afternoon Saturday. Une dealer

daily quota, two were out of
gasoline completely, and one, a
Mobil station on Centre" Avenue
seemed to be abandoned.
“People just don't wanna believe

Stuckert's Exxon has already laid

many of them full—time students at
Pitt. A sign announcing 24-hour
service is a running joke at the
station: “We haven't been open all
day long for months." Wiegle
declared flatly.

Station hours were cut back to
midnight. then to 9 p.m.; when
there's no gas to sell. the station
stays open for repairs and body
work.

Some form of self-ini_t_i_ated ra-
tioning is in effect at most service
stations in Oakland. “So far." says
Pawlak. “I'm getting about the
same amount of gasoline that l got
last year. But when that's gone. I
can't get any more."‘

Pawlak has a 5-gallon limit per
car. so that “I can stay open the
whole month."

Another Exxon dealer at Forbes
and S. Craig was closed for the
afternoon, and worried about it: “I
sold a thousand gallons o’ver my
limit for two days straight. I had to
close,” he explained. “I won’t be
getting any more gas until next
month. I should never’ve sold over
what I did.”

Dealer Pawlak took off on the oil

'companies' role in the crisis:

“From my standpoint. there's a
crisis. from the oil companies‘--no.

“What the company is doing isn't
fair." Pawlak explained. “but I'll
have to qualify that and say
why...at the beginning of the
shortage. way back, Gulf took on
new accounts like the Bi-Rite

stations that got dropped by their

own companies. Now Gulf's giving
them full--it's not fair.
“Those guys can sell their gas for

- less than l do. and I've been in the

business for 18 years. and l have to

be out of gas for 3 days in

“In my opinion, Gulf should take

care of their established dealers ~

first. What I get now is a drop in
the bucket."

The possibility of black market in
gasoline among dealers was ruled
“lt’s
against the law to sell another
brand of gas from my pumps and I
personally don’t know many
dealers who’d consider it, no
matter how bad things got.”

Pawlak and the other dealers
consider rationing as the best
alternative open to them.
Admitting that any measure would
severely curtail their business. few
thought they would be_ forced to
close as a result of the crisis.

“This will last several months.

prophesied.

“The oil companies want to get
the prices up to a certain point and
then they'll ease up."

- Echocd Exxon employee Scott:

“Prices will go up some, but not
much at all; I don‘t think people
will stand for it.

“A few of the smaller stations '

might have to close up, but this one
only opened up about a year ago
and it’s pretty big. We had to cut
back a lot to stay open, but there’s
no real chance of us closing down.”

The dealers were compensating
temporarily. the consensus being
to wait for President Nixon's
further announcements concerning
the energy crisis and then cutback
some more.

One dealer. however, grumbled.
half-jokingly: “I wish there‘d be
no more cars on the road at all. Tell

Transportation Troubles

(Continued from Page I)

Commuter Association (CA) Pres-
ident Margie Masilunas was
pleased with the Provost's action,
but added. “It should have been
taken sooner. There should be a
definite University policy concern-
ing such matters. I hope the strike
inspires the University ‘to make
such a policy."

The CA set up an emergency car
pool system in the Student Union
(SU) Monday. They are continuing
to take requests from commuters in
need of a ride and offers from
volunteer ‘drivers in room 518 SU.

However. many commuters are
still forced to find their own
alternative to the bus or trolley.
Some hitchhike. others cycle. and a
few even take taxis, but many
manage to get a ride from their
parent, a friend. or neighbor:

father drives us to class. but for me
it means leaving at 7 am for a noon
class and waiting, until 4:30 after
my classes are over at 2. for a ride
home." said Yvonne Niehie. a
junior from Carrick.

Although the majority of com-

muters seek rides. there are some

who are able to provide them. Bob
Depner. a sophomore from Ingram,
has been giving friends and
neighbors a ride since the strike
started. ’

So has Andy Marcinko, a
freshman from McKees Rocks. He
has a car, but before the strike took
the bus because of parking
difficulties. Such problems have
grown even worse since the strike.

“I'm lucky; I had my car to use. I
called some friends'Sunday night
to make sure they had a ride. On
the ride in, we see gangs of

students standing at the bus stops '

trying to get rides.” __
Some of them never do make it.

to the woman next to me. A collage
with grade school neatness,
solemnly presents pictures of
police assaulting demonsrtration
workers. Banners and signs read
like a telegram from California:
Please Help-Farmworkers-Boycott-
Grapes & Lettuce.

But, the mood of the workers at
the rally is high. Chavez carries a
kind ofelectricity with him. His
name brings buzzing of newspaper
stories and television appearances
and Father Joseph O’Malley
doesn’t dampen the mood when he
says that the 70s aren't like the
60's. He thinks the audience is the
hard core support.

“This crowd may not look so big.
But, take this crowd up the to A &
P on Forbes Avenue and they’ll
think it's large enough.”

There was a small group of folk
singers, students with blue work
shirts and jeans and thin voices,
singing, “You can't scare me. I’m
sticking to the Union!" But
they’ve been d_isplaced by the
preli\minary,speakers. Oliver
Montgomery, a spokesman for the
United Steelworkers,’ and William
Hill, an organizer of the wildcat
National Association of Steel-
haulers, ‘are both poised in their

business suits, to attack familiar‘
- Teamsters.

enemies.

“Until all workers are organized..
no worker will be free,” shouts Hill
as the applause ushers in Bill Hill.

“We have to support people like

Chavez and the United Farm-
workers against the corrupt Team-
ster goons who by making deals
with the companies are trying to
rob poor people of the right to make
a decent living.”

Bernice Black, a civil rights
organizer and member of the
Pittsburgh boycott team, gets to
the hard facts. “Some of you come
into the A & P and look at those
picket lines as if they’re pigs. But,
l’ve been on those lines and it isn't
easy to stand in the cold and ﬁght.

“You, you young people. We
were together before. You people
should come out and picket. Tell
everybody to stop going to the A &
P stores and buying grapes and
lettuce.”

Frank Ortiz, coordinator of the
Pittsburgh boycott organizes the
hand clapping to thank everyone in
unison, and presents several
worker-families from the untion
picket lines. So, when Chavez
ﬁnally steps onto the stage, he
almost seems mild mannered.

Chavez almost looks out of place.
His yellowand blue ski jacket,
plaid shirt and flared trousers
match his opening words. “Since
April when the United Farm
Workers’ contract ran out, farmers
have been bargaining with the
‘We don't say that all
our brothers in E the Teamsters
Union are trying to hurt us. We
recognize it is a problem of the
national leadership.”

A “Nixon Eats Lettuce"

Chavez hasn’t come to grind an
axe with the teamsters. But, he
wants to win support for his union.
With a curious lack of invective he
outlines the casualty list’ since
April. Six thousand people jailed,
42 people shot out, countless
beaten, and two men killed.

“It is one of the great tragedies of
this country,” says Chavez, “that
the men, women and children who
make up the labor force that feeds
the nation don't have enough food
to feed themselves. These people
are moved thousands of miles to
uncertain homes for uncertain
wages.”

Although the other speakers drew
sporadic applause, the audience
listens to Cesar Chavez. The crowd
is much larger now. Over a
thousand people easily.

“Now again we are appealing to
you. Don’t buy non-union lettuce.
Don’t buy non-union grapes or
drink Gallo wine.” Chavez points
out that Christian Brothers signed
with the UFW.

“But, most of all we need people
to be concerned. The beginning of
the end of all this suffering should

. begin right here, tonight."

His speech was the shortest of the
program. Surprisingly, he didn't
even shout menacing warnings to

the growers. His approach was to s

the sense of moral justice,
whatever and wherever it is.

_ ART-S EDITOR
 Inspiration can strike anywhere.
f_'t_'om a crowded street to a deserted
oifest. It may come in the form of a
‘divine. inexplicable breath or from
,_;i hu-man mouth.

5 .0 An inspiring conversation with
dancer Paul Sanasardo falls into
the latter category. I know he is
-human, I spoke with him in the
subdued light of the Boot and
"Saddle Lounge. There, surrounded
:by pictures of horses, he smoked
»fiIter‘cigarettes, sipped whiskey
isours, and munched potato chips as
‘we talked for over an hour on the
facets and directions of his art.

1 ‘Paul Sanasardo is origina_lly from
Chicago - and has been dancing

.:H  ,,W'e _iiesd'ay'i,-Dleeemlierifi’, 

asardo's Conversation Inspiring

since he was twelve.

“Not professionally. just for fun.
But it didn't take me too long to
realize that that was what I wanted
to do. After a while. I felt as
though I had worn out Chicago. so
the next stop was New York.

“There weren't as many oppor-
tunities for a dancer to get a start
then as there are today. I wanted
to be a dancer and I had to eat. So,
I danced every chance. from
broadway to eommercials--
anything I could get."

“Later, I got the chance to study
with Martha Graham and Anna
Sokolow.” Eventually, Sanasardo
was to break away from these
masters and set up a school of his
own. He rented a place in the city

 

of New York, found himself some
students, and in I963, the
Sanasardo Dance Company was
formed.

Currently. Sanasardo is the
artistic director of both the Modern
Dance Artists in New York. and the
annual Summer School of Modern
Dance at the Saratoga Performing
Arts Center. He has also appeared
as principle dancer for the
Washington Dance Theatre in
Washington. DC. along with film.
television and stage productions.

The ‘dancers life and rise to ‘
distinction was as encouraging as
any famous biography. Inspiration
came from the discussion of the
dance as an art. Voice and
gestures enforce his declaration of
devotion to the form.

PITTSBURGH, PA. 15222

“I consider myself a traditionalist,
even though I’ve been called
avant-garde by some critics.
Structure is very important to the
ideas I try to present.” ,

This tradition is not in the sense of
classical ballet, but of dance as a
pure art, capable ‘of evoking
interplay between performer and
audience.

“That's why film and TV don't
appeal to me. although I have tried
both. But I also feel thatywe have to
adapt ourperformanees to various
circumstances. although most of
the time I prefer procenium stage.
If where we're going doesn't have
any more than a gymnasium, we
use the gymnasium."

When asked how he gets his ideas
for a dance number. he called

himself a collector.

Paul Sanasardo, director of his own New York-based Dance Company.

"I collect ideas from everywhere.
I see a person. here, there. and
the ideas form. When I'm asked to
choreograph something I can just
pull the idea from my head." .

To become a Sanasardo dancer
might be one of the easiest or one
of the most difficult of tasks.

“It all depends on whether I feel a
person has something to offer. If
someone walks in off the street and
I think they’ve got it, they’re in.

Some of my students have been
with me for years but they’re not in
the company. It may sound unfair,
but that’s the way it works best.”

If the troupe‘s performance is
half as illuminating as the

conversation with Sanasardo. it will

have been well worth the time to
attend his free concert. Wednes-

endorsed by autograph. Backstage
with Cheech & Chong.

Cheech looked tired. Anyone
who saw what he goes through on
stage knows why. Chong looked
somewhat bored. At any rate,
Cheech & Chong in the dressing
room are not the same as Cheech &
Chong on stage.

Pitt News: eYou usually do a
conversation‘ type act. Suppose
Basketball Jones (their new musi-
cal single.) gets to .be a big thing
and everybody wants you to do
Basketball Jones all the time?
What are you going to do?

Cheech: Basketball Jones.

Chong: It's like the audience is
like a woman, right? And we're the
man making love to the audience.
and...

Cheech: Yeah. sometimes you
got to sing to them before you lay
them.

Chong: No. no. (he laughs) So
the woman says ‘Do it this way.'
what'd you say? No? You do it that
way. What ever the audience

demands. that's what you do.

Pitt News: You don’t care about
an image thing‘?

Cheech: Well. we were
Christian Scientists when we first
started. and it didn't tit the image.
so...
Chong: They excommunicated

us.

Cheech: So we changed our
religion to the Be High religion.
Our motto is ‘We'll always be
high.’

Pitt News: What would happen
if somebody gave you a television
series? _

Cheech: They have. We turned
it down. That's the truth. CBS.

Pitt News: How come you turned
it down‘?

Cheech: Thc_v wanted to censor
us too much. you know? What they
want us to do is too lame.

Chong: lt’s funny, in Canadian
television you can get away with
everything and it hasn't corrupted
anybody. The whole thing with
television is money. Well, we don’t
need money. We're rich the way
we are with records. .

"New Brunswick. New Jersey--
With the Pitt basketball team off to
perhaps its ﬁnest performance in
recent years. a mob of about four
hundred black students poured on
to the Rutgers basketball court last
night causing the game to
eventually be forfeited. with Pitt
ahead 36-21.
' The blacks storned the court with
exactly three minutes left in the
first half in an apparently well

The group apparently was from

other things that the college had

only one black full-time professor.

TONY DORSETT came yesterday
as the phenominal Pitt freshmen
running. back was selected by the

Associated Press to their first
team. Dorsett was the ﬁrst

‘ freshman selected to the team in 29
years to_ receive the honor.

Two Mickey Martin shots put the
Panthers ahead 4-0. Vinnie
Roundtree sunk a free throw for
Rutgers to make it 4-1 seconds
later. but that was as close as the
Scarlet Knights ever got.

Center Jim Bolla and Guard Kirk
Bruce sunk hoops before Rutgers
called time out to regroup, that
didn't help. though. as four
different Panthers hit on ﬁeld goals
to make the score '16-1. before
Roundtree connected for the first
Rutgers ﬁeld goal.

Rutgers began putting points on
the board, but Pitt didn’t lose its
cool and was maintaining its lead.
Rutgers tried a full court press, but
this resulted in more Pitt break-
aways than turnovers.

The variating Panther defense

continued to stymie the Scarlet-

Knight offense which had trouble
getting the ball in for a good shot.

When Rutgers did get the ball in, a
combination of tight Pitt defense

V and poor Rutgers shooting resulted

in many missed shots.

Pitt had gone to a 36-17 lead on a
steal and layup by Keith Starr and
after two quick Rutgers hoops. the
students stormed the floor.

“I was really pleased the way our
team was handling them,” said
Ridl. “I was pleased the way we

did against a’ quick team Iike_

“After that loss at West Virginia,

the nation to become the ﬁrst
freshman named to the AP
All-American squad in 29 years.

He finished with 1,586 yards
rushing, erasing the old NCAA
freshman record of 1,291 yards set
by Ron “Po” James of New Mexico
State in 1968. .

“Dorsett is the most outstanding
back I've ever witnessed," said Pitt
Coach Johnny Majors- “I'm not
pushing him for the Heisman
Trophy because he is a fresh, but if
you're picking the best in the
country’ he should be a deﬁnite
candidate." .

The Heisman winner will be
announced Tuesday in New York.
and Dorsett is expected to receive
some votes. but he doesn't expect
to win.

“I know that being a freshman
makes it unlikely, and I really don’t
think I have much of a chance,”
said the 5-foot-11, 175 pounder. '

“But fhei Heisman is something
to dream about," he added. “It
goes to the best and that's what I'd
like to aim for. That and a national
championship for_ Pitt. They're
things to work toward." .

Dorsett. who scored 23 touch-
downs in his senior season at
Hopewell High School, is described
by Pitt backﬁeld Coach Harry
Jones as “quick as a hic-cup."

“Fantastic moves. I-Ie’s there
one second and he’s gone,” Notre
Dame All-American defensive back
Mick Townsend said after Dorsett
rushed for 209 yards in a 31-10 loss
to the Irish.

It was the most yards by one
player ever against Notre Dame.
and Coach Ara Parseghian was
impressed. '

added. This was the ﬁrst time we
have won here."

The takeover of the ﬁoor was not
entirely unexpected. As soon as
Roundtree and Rutgers sophomore
Phil Sellers saw the students
moving on to the ﬁoor, they held up
their hands as if to say. “Oh. No!
They didn't do it." Apparently
they knew something was going to
happen.

Sellers immediately grabbed the
microphone and pleaded with the
students to return to their seats. —
“Come on brothers and sisters,”
Sellers said. “How about giving us
brothers a chance.”

Sellers was ignored by the mob
and was actually pushed away from
the mike. Both teams were then
ordered to their locker rooms by.the
ofﬁcials. who called the forfeit
about 15 minutes later.

During that time school ofﬁcials
talked to the students. but they
refused to leave the court. No

That
speaks for itself."

Dorsett scored 12 touchdowns
this season and rushed for over 100
yards in nine games. His best day
came against Northwestern when
he piled up 265 yards and -he also

Ron Selfridge was applying a salve on his soring leg muscles.

He was getting himself ready for his match this Thursday night at
eight o’clock at the Pitt Field House, as the 1973-74 Pitt Panther
wrestling team opens its season against a tough Michigan squad.

When considering what Selfridge had to go through to get in the

he needed a heating compound for his muscles.

teammate and rival Jeff Weis in the weekly wrestle-offs two out of

three times.

It wasn't easy. Weis could just as easily have won.

Ron defeated Jeff in the ﬁrst match, 5-3, shooting a takedown with
less than ﬁve seconds to go. Never changing his facial expressions,
Selfridge walked off the mat as if he had won 10-0. Weis,‘ a more
excitable dude. came out with vengeance last Friday night and

He shot_ a reversal and near pin in the last 15

seconds (5_ points) to seemingly coast to a 7-2 win. Weis was aroused.
Then in a classic ﬁnale, Selfridge insured his s.,1rting berth against

the Wolverines by downing Weis 3-2

winning point.

in overtime, escaping for the

In view of the fact that you have to win in the eliminations in order to
wrestle in the varsity matches, one might expect Selfridge to be overly

excited. Actually. he isn't.

“You can’t draw any comparison between the varsity matches and
the eliminations,” he said, as he applied more salve. “I can’t get up,
for the eliminations. You wrestle the same guy every day and you both’
know what the other guy has. There's a big difference. I think Schuck
is going to be a lot tougher. They’re just as important though.”

Schuck is Bill Schuck, the Michigan_142 pounder, who will oppose
Selfridge Thursday. A sophomore, Schuck was the Ohio State champ

before going to Michigan.

It’s formidable opposition.

“I have a lot of moves Schuck doesn't know of," the 5-10 Selfridge
added. “The people in the stands are going to inspire me. I wrestle a

lot better against good people.

I'm going to win."

One of the people in the stands will be Weis and Selfridge is assured

of at least one fan.

- "If Jeff beats me in the eliminations I'd be rooting for him in the

match.

And if he won I'd feel I could. have won too." Selfridge
“We're close despite being opponents in practice.

He's sure Weis feels the same way. Besides. there will be other

eliminations.

Two NEw DOCUMENTS To
EXPEDITE AND IMPROVE

The University is introducing .

two new documents with the
Winter term of the 1973-1974
school year to speed-up student
registration. They are a person-
alized Class Schedule Card and
a combination Statement, Valida-
tion Certificate which itemizes
charges,

The Class Schedule Card will
be mailed to all registered stud-
ents as verification of the
courses chosen and should be
checked for accuracy.

The Class Schedule Card must
be p_resented to,the Advisor and
or the Registration Office when
a student makes a change in his
or her schedule during the Add

ber 3. 1973 and ending January
22. 1974. A new card-will be

retained until all grades are re-

fice will accept grades for only
those courses and sections indi-
cated on these cards.

The Statement and Validation

other function of the former Ac-
ademic Invoice. that of inform-

ed to his registration. and a great
deal more. This single document
will list both the academic and
housing charges for each term.
It will also list any unpaid
charges for prior terms. While
not appearing on the Winter state-
ment. within the next year.
Scholarship and Loan Aid award-
ed and recorded prior to the
billing of the student's registra-
tion will also be included.

This si_mplified consolidated
billing should provide many
benefits:

1. A single document will list in
detail and summarize a stud-
_ent's entire financial status
with the University. This
should eliminate a great deal

Joe Paterno of Penn State, who
has coached such stars as Franco
Harris, Lenny Moore, Lydell
Mitchell, Jack Ham, Mike Reid,
Ted Kwalick and John Hufnagel,
calls Cappelletti “the greatest
player I’ve ever been around.”

Cappelletti, who played defen-
sive back as a sophomore, carried
286 times for 1,522 yards this
season and scored 17 touchdowns,

He is the 37th offensive back but
the first Penn State player to win
the Heisman Trophy in the 39-year
history ofthe award. He also is the
first player from an Eastern school
to win it since Roger Staubach of
Navy in 1963.

Last year’s winner was ﬂanker
Johnny Rodgers of Nebraska.

The Heisman voters, who tra-
ditionally have favored seniors and
men who played offensive backﬁeld
positions. maintained those feel-
ings this year. No interior lineman
has ever won the trophy, which,
incidentally, is a 17‘/2-inch bronze

1972 and responded by gaining
1,117 yards.

“No matter how bad things go,"
says Paterno, “you'll always be in
the football game. That’s why he’s
the best player I've ever been
around. He's faster than Mitchell
and probably faster over 40 yards
than Harris. He runs a 4.6 40 in

In expressing his feelings before
the announcement why Cappelletti
was a more deserving candidate
than John Hicks, Ohio State's
two-time All-American offensive
tackle, Paterno referred to Penn
State's ﬁnal regular season contest
against Pitt. The Nittany Lions
trailed 13-3 at halftime but rallied
in the final two periods with
Cappelletti providing some strong
running. J

“Hicks couldn’t have won that
game for us," Paterno said.
“Hicks couldn’t have gotten Pitt
out of cloud 9; Cappy did.”

REMEMBER
Last S.U.B. films of the term!!!

 

Now my Daddy, I treat him right.

. When he comes dragging home at

night I fluff up his ego. Slip off his
shoes. Hand him his pipe. And head
for the Akadama wine. Forget those
tooty-fruity wines. They’re for boys,
not for my Old Man. So I get out my
Akadama recipe card and mix him
one of my love potions. You’d be sur-
prised how fine at Saturday can be
when you start it off with Akadama
Red and orange juice. And the sec-
ond best way I know to end the day
is with Akadama Red and cham-
pagne. So if you Want my advice, Ms.
