Pittsburgh mayor and candi-
date for re-election Richard Cali-
guiri met Monday with student
government leaders and campus
newspaper reporters from Alle-

f};>gheny’s nine colleges and universi-

ties to discuss issues concerning
their campus constituents.

The hour-long discussion in the
mayor’s office covered a broad
range of topics of student concern.
From Oakland zoning to Commun-
ity College stop signs, the mayor
promised action.

As to the ongoing battle between
Oakland community groups and the
University, Caliguiri urged all
factions to pull together. ‘ ‘I believe
in community groups,” he said,
‘ ‘but the groups involved have been
treated too diversely.”
cited .a $100,000 study of Oakland

hat will involve “everyone who is a
permanent ﬁxture. We must
collectively involve everyone to
solve this problem.

‘ ‘I hope this will be the last study
concerning the direction of Oakland
for a while,” Caliguiri added.

The purposes of the Oakland
study, the mayor said, is to gather
all the facts before a decision is
made concerning Oakland’s future.
He promised to involve Pitt’s
Student Government Board in the
study.

“When questioned about pay-
ments Pitt’s Student Government
Board in the study.

When questioned about pay-

nts, Pitt, 8. non-taxable institu-

The mayor-

services, Caliguiri explained that 33
percent of city property was
non-taxable. “That’s quite a slice
of taxable land,” he said. In lieu of
taxes, Caliguiri said, the city has set
up funding to collect revenues for
services rendered. “All the city
wants is enough‘ money to warrant
service paid for exclusively by
taxpayerS;” he said.

Caliguiri pointed out this comes
to $60,000 per yearfor Pitt. “That’s
not too much to ask from a $200
million budget,” he said.

The mayor confessed to need a
briefing to answer a question about
Robert Morris College's non-tax
exemption. “I don’t understand
why the city would discriminate
against Robert Morris. they should
be treated like Pitt or Duquesne,”
he saulbontintted on Page 2}

His partner, who goes by the
name “Bob,” is still at large.

According to campus police,
Surrpat and his partner approached
four male freshmen, who had come
to register and look at their
dormitory rooms, in the Towers
lobby Aug. 15, and asked them if
they were interested in buying
warehouse goods. The freshmen
expressed interest and made a deal
to pay Surrapt and his partner $300
in cash for a television and three
stereos.

After a visit to Mellon Bank, the
students paid the dealers $240, then
drove them to Swissvale to pick up a
key to the warehouse where the
dealers told them the goods’ were
stored. Then they returned to on
an alley behind Fifth Avenue High
School on the 1800 block of Watson
Street. Surrapt and his partners got
out of the car, allegedly to get the
equipment for the students, but
never returned.

The students did not speak of the
incident until Labor Day, when they
spotted the dealers on the Towers
patio and asked where their
merchandise was. Surrapt and his
partner told the students they could
have the television and stereos if
they paid $150 more. The
freshmen paid the sum and took the
dealers to the 1800 block of Watson
Street.

Again, the dealers left and the
students receivedno equipment.

On Sept. 6, a 19-year-old Pitt
sophomore was approached by
Surrapt and his partner in his
third-floor Webster Hall room. The
student agreed to pay $150 for
stereo equipment, and, with a
friend, met the dealers outside the
hotel at 8 p.m. The four men then

caught a bus on the corner of Fifth
and Bellefield to the same behind
Fifth Avenue High School. Surrapt
and his partner told the sophomore
and his friend to wait there while
they got the equipment, but did not
return. S

Last Wednesday, some of the
student victims spotted the dealers
in the Student Union and -called
campus police. The officers picked

up Surrapt and his partner, but
released them due to a lack of
evidence. After interviewing the
victims, police issued warrants for
the two 'men the following day.

Surrept’s partner, who escaped
arrest, is described as being a black
22 to 25-year-old male, 6-3 and
150-160 lbs. “Bob”. has long
sideburns and wears a wide-
brimmed hat.

SG Assembly Meets,
Members Disgruntled

I By MAGGIE McKAY

Pitt News Staff Writer

Arguments over organizational
purpose, voting procedures and
by-laws marked the ﬁrst fall term
meeting of the Student Government
Assembly yesterday.

Representatives from 35 of 117
recognized student organizations
attended, some of whom stated
their presence was due only to
Student Government Board threats
to freeze group budgets for
non-attendance.

Last May, the SGB froze the
budgets of 59 student organizations
when these groups neglected to
name representatives to the Assem-
bly, formed after a referendum was
passed in last year’s student
government elections.

“lthink wepha-ve to deal with why
people aren't here. Is it because
they are forced‘ to come? I have a
lot of questions about the purpose of

this assembly,” Collective for
Alternative Education member
Barry Glunt said.

According to Student Govem-

ment Assembly by-laws formally-

approved at this meeting. the
Assembly is to represent a
“consolidated opinion of the
recognized undergraduate student
organizations on campus, concern-
ing position and policy statements
for the Student Government
Board’s consideration and action.”

The Assembly gathers three
times during the school year with its
next meeting scheduled for Janu-
ary. A Student Assembly Council
will meet monthly and will consist of
representatives from the Engineer-
-ing Student Cabinet, Black Action
Society, Resident Student Associa-

tion, Interfraternity Council, Pan-

hellenic Association, Nursing Stu-
dent Organization and Association

of Undergraduates in Education.

SG Assembly Members Meet  

(Continued from Page 1)

Any decisions made by the
council can be reversed by the
Assembly, according to Assembly
chairman Josh Baylson. All actions
ultimately must pass the full
assembly, which is structured like
the Faculty Assembly in this
respect.

Five general assembly members
were elected to be at-large
representatives in the assembly
council in addition to the seven’

permanent groups.
Though most of the meeting was
concerned with making changes in

the by-laws and member voting
procedures, the Assembly did vote
to set up task forces dealing with
commuter problems and the
allocation of office space in the
Student Union.

The Assembly also approved a
resolution stating student organiza-
tions should be allocated adequate

working space in Schenley,Hall and
that the Assembly have some input
into future office-shuffling deci-
sions.

Last year, 16 student organiza-
tions were forced to share ofﬁce
space. Many organizations have
been evicted from their rooms in the
Student Union and are now
complaining that while they can
meet in designated meeting rooms,
they do not have room to store
records and ﬁles.

Concerning Oakland police pro-

committed to ﬁll every vacancy in
Pittsburgh’s police department. “I
want 1,500 in the police force,” he
said. “I’ve ﬁlled every patrol

all districts, including Oakland

“I plan to deal with crime in two

said, “and crime that is imagined.

Mayor Turns Attention

A plan to equip cab drivers with
two-way radios so they could
watch for suspicious activity now Is
under consideration. Caliguiri said
the system is in effect in other cities
and would receive ﬁnancial aid.
The cab drivers would have no
an-est powers but would contact
police’ if they saw anything
suspicious.

Caliguiri also expressed concern .

“9

‘,

over public transit. “In the near . '

future, it will have to be subsidized
by the Federal government.
There’s no way it can make money
without budget cuts and deteriorat-
ing service.”

The mayor promised to try to
make landlords live up to city
standards. “There's no reason why
the city cannot put student legal
associations in direct contact with
building inspectors,” he said.

Caliguiri also promised a review
of parking meter distribution in
Oakland. “Meters provide parking
turnover, and some areas merit this
kind of activity."

 Alternative Curriculum
‘Now Full-Time Program

v" ‘V.

BY PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Alternative Curriculum (AC)
program became a full-time pro-
gram this year after four years as an
experimental program. The in-
creased budget and full scale
acceptance obtained from the
University Senate last March has
made it possible for the AC to
encompass second year students. In
the past, the program was limited to
freshmen.

According to Dr. Gloria Frazier,
one of the program’s founders, the
AC provides the student with the
freedom of choice necessary to
select classes. It also is beneﬁcial to
the student who has not decided
upon a major, as one of the
program’s aims is to expose the
student to a. wider variety of
subjects than is normally available.

“AC provides a choice the
student normally would not have,”
Frazier said. “There is more
individualized attention for stu-
dents because the staff is able to
work closely with them.”

According to a 1973 survey that

ompared AC students to a control

group of non AC students, the»

students were fairly similar: AC
students are no more likely to drop
out of college than non AC students,
both groups had similar Scholastic
Aptitude Test (SAT) scores and
both earned similar QPAs.

The survey also revealed AC
students are more likely to major in
the humanitiesand tend to avoid the
natural sciences. It is suspected
some professional degree which
generally require natural science
credits strongly discourage stu-
dents from taking AC or any other
non-traditional program.

The study also revealed that AC
students chose from 23 different

majors while the control group..

chose from only 15. This is
attributed to the wider range of
course choices.

“Students in the AC do tend to
major in the humanities, but there
also is a good number of who take
social sciences, «particularly eco-
nomics, and natural sciences,
especially psychology,” Frazier
said.

At present, there are no plans to
expand AC beyond the sophomore
year, Frazier said.

       
   
   
  

Is experience really the best
teacher? This fall. the Pitt/Oak-

chance to find out.

The YMCA service organization
has dozens of opportunities for
students who want to volunteer
their time to help “bridgethe gap
between student and community.”
These opportunities in areas such
as education. mental health. health
care. care for the disabled and
corrections. enable anyone who
wants to become involved.

"For as little as one hour a week.
you can help someone in need and
at the same time. help discover

“72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

SGB Review-Part II

Last February we called upon the Student Government
Board (SGB) to take adynamic stand against a tuition hike.
With nary a protest a tuition hike went through last May and
budget cuts were made, also with little student input.

Today the University faces another fiscal obstacle. The
state legislature has held up Pitt’s $60—some million
appropriation until a tax can be passed to fund it. The
administration has included SGB in its lobbying effort in
Harrisburg. The lobbying planned is so massive that it is
natural for the administration toiinclude SGB in its effort.
But SGB should keep three points in mind.

When contacting the governor and legislature, an activist
stand is necessary. Activism is not synonymous with violence,
but SGB must have the state believe it is dealing with a
representative student government that is ready to sit down
and discuss fiscal matters.

The formation of a student lobby with Pennsylvania’s
other state-related schools promised by last January’s
candidates. Most of the lobby has fallen through because of
internal squabbling at Lincoln and Temple.‘The board must
go ahead with Penn State and rally student support for higher
education funding, and continue to search for a way to fund

In the event its effort is not completely successful and Pitt
is short-changed by a few million dollars, one of the
alternatives the administration will have is to cut the budget.
The board must not let the administration snip away as it did
last summer. Instead, SGB must exercise its right to sit down
with the administration and look over the budget.

We argued last February and still believe it true that SGB
.should_ not have to hear second-hand what gets cut and by
how much. Now is the time to go out and discuss priorities
with deans and department heads.

The new student assembly, which met yesterday, can
present a large enough work force to gather data to oppose
the legislature’s budget-carvers and those in the
administration. This new assembly represents all facets of
student involvement and can be a valuable resource when
drawing up academic priorities. ' V

, Friday’s editorial will examine the issue of increased
student input. Has SGB lived up to campaign promises?

Letters to the Editor

History Slated for Bulldozer

On June 10, 1942, the small
Czech town of Lidice was literally
levelled by Nazi bulldozers in
retaliation for the assassination of
the SS chief, Heinrich Heydrich.
Hitler thought that the eradication
of Lidice from the face of the earth
was necessary not only to terrorize
the general populace and hence
insure their continued submission
but, more importantly, to eliminate
the memory of any opposition to his
regime. Just as the true nature of
the “ﬁnal solution” was hidden
from the German people in order to
keep conscience, questions and
criticisms ‘to a minimum, so the
physical presence of this town was
wiped out in yet another sinister
application of the principle, “out of
sight, out of mind.”

On Sept.. 19, 1977-35 years
later—bulldozers once again began
to efface a memory. This time the
machines were not operated by
Nazis and the levelling job was not
in retaliation for a speciﬁc act of
terrorism, but the purpose was the
same: to destroy the past, to
extirpate the remembrance of
opposition to the regime.

Anyone who cannot see the
connection between these events
should, in the words of Bob Dylan,
“hereby take two steps to the right,
paint your teeth and go to sleep.”
If the destruction (under the
pretext of the need for a new gym)
of the ﬁeld on which four Kent
State students were murdered
seven years ago does not appear to
be effected in the grand fascist
tradition, it is only because
manipulation of the collective
memory in the United States works

a bit differently. Here in the land
of Disney World, forgetfulness is
not necessarily induced at gun-
point. Rather, it has been deeply
ingrained in our way of life. As
soon as the Vietnam War ended,
we were told to forget it. to mend
the rips in our national fabric. The
minute Watergate was over and
Nixon resigned, President Ford
told us to forget it; and in order to
help us forget, Nixon was pardoned
and the conspirators were given
sentences so light that all of them
are presently out of jail. The return
of Eldridge Cleaver, Mark Rudd
and others to the light of day has

led news commentators to sigh

with relief that that terrible era of
unrest in the l960’s is gradually
being forgotten. Now the
government would have us forget
that we ever resisted their criminal
plans and that four of us were shot
to death for that resistance.

To forget, however, by its very
deﬁnition, means not to learn. And
a country that buries its history
with bulldozers faces only stagna-
tion and despotism. if it is not
already in the grip of both. The

struggle to preserve, the site of the 9

Kent State shootings should not,
therefore, be seen as one waged by
sentimental leftists for possession
of a -morbid shrine. It is, in fact, a
battle to prevent not only the
destruction of part of the rightful
heritage of America’s oppostion,
but also the erasure of the
recognition that the causes for
which those students protested that
spring day still stand and cannot be
so easily buried. Hitler razed
Lidice so that men and women

preclude its serving us as an
inspiration and an education as
well as to help us forget that you
get shot here when you try to
change things.

Despite Hitler’s temporary suc-
cess in wiping out the memories of
Lidice. it was resurrected upon his
defeat and serves today as a lesson
about the brutal excesses, of
totalitarianism. If we lose the ﬁeld ‘
at Kent today, however, who will
defeat our tyrants and restore our
history? We have both a duty and a
right to learn the lessons of Kent
State. for our tuition has been paid
in blood.

Paul (Who? Announces \‘/ictory

By R. DAVID TIVE

_ The announcement stunned all
those at the press conference. There
was Paul Nyden, resplendent in his

' new $250 Pierre Cardin suit, telling

the world that he had ﬁnally won his
battle against the University of
Pittsburgh.

‘ ‘I feel this is the most signiﬁcant
victory for political freedom since
George McGovem’s smashing de-
feat of Richard Nixon in 1972 or
Salvadore Allende’s successful
resistance to the coup attempt in
Chile,” Nyden said.

When a reporter questioned
Nyden’s victory and pointed out
that 1835 than one month ago, he
had signed an agreement with Pitt
to aceegt a reported $50,000 in

mama in mm 'dub&g tthéir

dpforstep again, Nyden shrugged it
o .

“That agreement is meaning-
less,” he said. “What’s important
is that during the struggle, which I
skillfully dragged out as long as I
could, we brought out issues and
principles of concern to all students
at Pitt and all taxpayers in
Penn sylvania. ’ ’

In response to another reporter's
comment that it might be hard to
justify that last claim, since the only
time Nyden drew a large crowd was
when he provided free music on the
Student Union lawn on a nice spring
day, Nyden smiled patronizingly.

“I’ve heard that charge before,
and you are simply misinterpreting
the facts. You fail to notice that the
band and the nice spring day were

at our last rally. and we did our

more students than ever before.
This proves that as we reached the
end of our struggle, our support was
peaking.”

A spokesperson for the West
Pennsylvanian Citizens for Justice
at Pitt (WPCJ P) expressed surprise
at the apparent shock on the part of
the press concerning Nyden’s claim
of victory. ' -

“Given the magnitude of our
victory,” she said, “I would think it
would be. visible to the most
disinterested and uninformed ob-
server. We have decisively beaten
what is perhaps the most racist,
sexist and politically repressive
institution in the modern world.
Surely you must have noticed.”

A reporter for the Canonoburg
Notes, the senior correspondent
present, asked Nyden what the

long-range effects of his victory
would be.

“We anticipate there will be a
complete change of leadership at
Pitt,” Nyden replied. “As WPCJP
announced in a letter to the Pitt
News on Monday, a letter that also
announced my victory, we now are
asking for the resignation of
Chancellor Posvar. The University
was so damaged by our charges,
principles and mass turnouts at
rallies that by the end of the month
we expect not only Posvar’s
resignation, but that of all the
capitalist stooges on the Board
of Trustees as well.

“Let's take the Allende thing as
an example,” Nyden said. ‘ ‘He won
a victory because what he was
saying was right. His truths were so
powerful, and won him so much

support, that his opponents just had
to kill him. That’s how he won his ,
victory.” 
The spokesperson for
stated, in response to a question,
that since Nyden’s ﬁght had been
brought to a satisfactory conclusion,
the group was looking for new
horizons to conquer. -
“We have tentatively decided t

abolish all racism, sexism and
political repression throughout the
world,” she proclaimed. “We
realize that this is a signiﬁcantly
larger task than the Nyden case, but
our membership is up to 25 people
now, and by dynamic articulation of
our principles we expect to be able

to see results by Easter.” 1
A University spokesman, asked

to comment on Nyden’s claim of
victory, could only respond, “Paul

“Ithink we have to be accessible
to students because we are here to
serve them,” said Pitt’s new
director of ﬁnancial aid, Frank M.
Dutkovich’Jr. ‘‘I feel this strongly.
Were it not for the students, we
would not have to be here.”

Dutkovich was appointed to his
post be a search committee formed
to ﬁll the vacancy made by the
resignation of former ﬁnancial aid
director Charles Dees. Dees
resigned last September to accept a

We urgently need your records on file before first sign up date,

postion as assistant to the
president of Wheeling College.

Upon Dee’s departure from the
University, Dutkovich was made
acting director while the search
committee began accepting appli-
cations for the director’s position.
On July 1, the search committee
informed Dutkovich his application
had been approved and that he was
the permanently director of ﬁnan-
cial aid.

Among the changes imple-
mented und_er Dutkovich are
standardization, of the hourly wage
for students in the work-study
program, automatic mailing of
renewal applications to students
already receiving assistance and an
increased emphasis on communica-
tions with students.

Two dollars and ﬁfty cents an
hour is now the standard wage for
all work-study students.

To achieve his goal of increased

communication, Dutkovich will

make a reprinted edition of an
informative pamphlet, “General
Information,” available to students
“within a month or so.” The
four-page pamphlet, originally
prepared by Dees, lists deadlines,
explanations and qualiﬁcations for
the various grants and loans
available to students. “We refer to
it as the throwaway,” Dutkovich
added.

The Financial Aid Ofﬁce also
prints a longer, in-depth brochure,
“Student Aid at the University of
Pittsburgh.” This booklet is

- geared primarily to freshmen and

transfer students. It focuses on
questions such as how to apply to
the University, what costs will be
and what funds are available.

In response to the generally
negative attitude toward the
Financial Aid Office he perceives in
students, Dutkovich‘ said, “We’re
bound by Federal regulations of
various types, so while it may seem
we’re being punitive to the
students, we’re just trying to
adhere to the regulations.”

DutkovichNew Aid Director

Deadlines reinforce the negative 5-

image of the Financial Aid Ofﬁce.
Despite the aggravation deadlines
sometimes cause, the'ofﬁce will try
to adhere to deadlines that ~» are
ofﬁcially set. “I think our ﬁrst
obligation is to the students who
ﬁle on time,” Dutkovich said.

“That is not to preclude a family
that has a sudden change of
circumstances,” he added.

Dutkovich would like to have the
chance to “be available to a
student for an interview, if he or
she really has a problem in
ﬁnancing an education.”

But there are difficulties with
group discussions on this topic,
Dutkovich explained. “You can’t
get to the core of the problem
because many people would feel
the same way; they’d be reluctant
to discuss their speciﬁc, individual
circumstances with large groups.”

“We are primarily an under-
graduate aid office,” Dutkovich
said, “but we will award Federal

funds to graduate students when

they’re eligible.”
Discussing federal and state
educational grants, Dutkovich said

the only obstacle preventing a $400
increase in the maximum basic

grant is approval by the Congress. ‘

This approval would raise the grant

to $1,800 for the 1977-78 academic 

year.

For the same year, the Penn-
sylvania Higher Education As-
sistance Agency (P.H«.«E.A.A.) will
make no signiﬁcant change in the
amount "of money they allocate.

“They (P.H.E.A.A.) will meet
up to one-third of a Pitt student’s
need, and pay a maximum of 80

percent of tuition,” Dutkovich said. i

This ﬁgure of $1,025.50 also
applies to other state-related
universities such as Penn State and
Temple.

Students at
institutions like Carnegie-Mellon
and Duquesne are eligible for up to
$1,500 from the state agency.

Rich Gives Impressive Show

By DAN McKAY

Famed drummer Buddy Rich will
bring his band into the Pittsburgh
area for two shows this Friday
night at the Great Gatsby Supper
Club in Cheswick.

The band, just back from a tour
of Japan, is expected to sell out
both the 9:30 p.m. and midnight
shows. They are always cohesive
and tight, whether on vinyl or on
stage, probably because they
spend eight to 10 months on tour
each year. The band will leave for

a European tour right after this
current American tour ends.

Buddy Rich began his profes-
sional career back in 1938 as the
drummer for the Joe Marsellos

Buddy Rich
Band, but he first started playing
drums as a 2-year old musical

prodigy.

From the Marsellos band, Rich
moved on to play for Bunny
Berrigan and his hand. Then,
Tommy Dorsey wanted him. The
word was out on Buddy Rich and he
was much in demand.

Tommy Dorsey wanted him, and
he joined that orchestra at the same
time Frank Sinatra was singing for
them. Then he played for Artie
Shaw until he formed his own band
in 1966.

The current lineup in Rich's
band is made up of men young
enough to be his sons. The four
trumpets. three trombones and ﬁve
Saxophones comprising the band
are propelled by the drumming of
Rich himself. This is the same
basic orchestration Count Basic
and Woody Herman used in their
bands.

Buddy has been married to his
wife. Marie, for 25 years. While
the Riches have no son who could
follow in his father’s footsteps.
their only daughter Cathy, 21,
formerly sang with the band.

As most of his followers know,
Rich holds a black belt in karate.
This is his main avocation, and he
says he became interested in it to
keep in shape. If his drumming is
any kind of indication, he is ﬁt as a

ﬁddle. _
Joe Jones, of the Count Basie

Orchestra, and Chip Webb were
early idols of Buddy’s. Today, he
needs no idols. But among the
current ﬁeld of popular drummers,
Rich says that he likes Bobby
Colomby of Blood, Sweat & Tears,
Steve Gadd of Stuff and Danny
Seraphine of Chicago.

The latest album by Buddy Rich
and the band is called “Buddy Rich
Plays and Plays and Plays.”

  Film ‘MacAurther’

Can’t Beat ‘Patton’ 

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN
Pitt News Staffwriler
MacArthur
Directed by Joseph Sargent

It's inevitable that comparisons
are drawn between the recently
released “.‘MacArthur” and the
7-year-old “Patton,” since both
ﬁlms proﬁle the military and private
lives of two of America’s greatest
generals and heroes of World War
II.

‘ ‘MacArthur, ’ ’ the handsomely
made character study of ﬁve-star
General Douglas MacArthur that is
currently at the Fulton Theater,
unfortunately will be the ﬁlmithat
will not endure over time. It is
simply not the blockbuster

“Patton” was.

Although Gregory Peck’s somber
and methodical portrayal of
MacArthur is an accurate reflection
of the man’s personality, it is
nowhere near as entertaining or
engrossing as George C. Scott's
Academy award-winning portrayal

of Patton.
In reality, MacArthur was the

more important general, in terms of
the World War II pecking order. H

was the supreme commander of
both the American and Allied forces
in the Paciﬁc theater, while Patton

I!

was just a regional commander in-

Europe and later in North Africa.

Admittedly, both were highly
vain, ambitious and brilliant
military strategists, famous, or
infamous, for their maverick
challenges of authority and daring
wartime decisions.

What -makes Patton the more
entertaining ﬁlm subject is his
outrageous ﬂamboyance. He was
the more colorful and entertaining
maverick general.

Patton used to strap Wild West
six-guns to his side—MacArthur
smoked ornately carved pipes.
Patton was rude and used salty
language—MacArthur was arti-
culate and mannerly. These
differences also explain the comedy
levels of both ﬁlms.

“MacArthur” is a highly serious
study of the general’s relationships
with Presidents Roosevelt and
Truman, love for his attractive wife
and young son and overwhelming
concern with “duty, honor and

country.” Laughs are few and farfag

between. .

The most important scenes in
“MacArthur” show MacArthur’s
major role in the American
evacuation of and triumphant
return to the Philippines, the
reconstruction of Japan after the
dropping of the atomic bomb, the
subsequent surrender and the
interaction with Roosevelt and
Truman.

Although Peck is the
unquestioned focus of attention,
both Dan O’Herlihy as Franklin
Delano Roosevelt and Ed Flanders
as Harry S. Truman turn in

amazingly realistic portrayals. _,\ “‘

Flanders in particular captures?

the fiery Truman spirit in scenes at
the White House with his advisers
and in the Paciﬁc for a face-to-face
conference with MacArthur over
policy.

Joseph Sargent’s concise direc-
tion packs in the most important
aspects of the general’s life, from
the Philippines until his farewell
speech in front of mesmerized
cadets at his beloved West Point.
MacArthur’s family background,
religious convictions and attitudes
toward life and war are subtly and
effectively worked in during various
parts of the ﬁlm.

In particular, MacArthur’s view‘ of
war is somewhat disturbing. WE;
shown to be capable of compassion,
embracing wounded soldiers and
old colleagues from the Philippines
encounter, MacArthur seems an
almost holy and healing man, one
who attracts love and respect from
entire nations of men and women.

Yet, when the Korean War
breaks out in the early 50’s, '
MacArthur, in a scene with his wife,
expresses gratitude that “an old
warrior will ﬁnally get another
chance” to make the history books.

MacArthur was greatly cone’?
ned with his role in the history of

'war and his place among other great
. commanders in history like Caesar,

Hannibal and Robert E. Lee.

In fact,_he felt Truman had robbed
him of the glory that would have
been his, had the President allowed
him to end the war from the ground
instead of dropping the atomic
bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Lovers of war action may be
disappointed with ‘ ‘ MacArthur. ’ ’

Perhaps the most effective war
scene shows the general making an

carrier during the surrender

Wanted: Point Totals
To Impress Pollsters

By 3013 EVANS ‘

,y-_, ,x, -v._ ,v,,:- I\4- 4 u -
4 v r_

Last year, Tom Brzoza, Pitt’s all-America offensive lineup, stated a
simple fact: “College football is big business.”
Like any other business, it is at times complex. And certainly one of

\ the most complex, aspects of college football are the Top 20 polls, those

weekly edicts from the heavens that proclaim who reigns sumpreme in
the NCAA’s kingdom.

As a for-instance, follow this piece of _battered logic from the
Associated Press’ (AP) ﬁrst two weekly rankings: Houston and UCLA,
both pre-season Top 10 teams, met in their opening game and Houston
one. Houston thereby solidiﬁed a
lock among the nation's top teams.
Pitt, pre-season number seven, lost
to Notre Dame (then rated in the.top
three) and fell to 16th. So far, ‘so
good.

Then came the results and
subsequent rankings from Week
Two of the season. Pitt beat
William and Mary, 28-6, and
dropped completely out of the Top
20; Houston got swamped by Penn
State, 32-14, and hung on as
19th-ranked.

This is not to imply Pitt should be
rated number one, or that
Michigan, currently number one, is
actually a limp ﬁsh in a great
white’s clothing. The point is that
polls must be viewed in their true
context: a consensus from sports
writers across the country.

It would be nice there were a
football god to bless us with divine
inspiration about the true rankings,
or a computer that could logically
unravel the mess, or some
omniscient sports writer who could
see the true light. But, like the
ﬁve-cent cigar, such thing don’t
exist. What, then, are we left with?
To answer that question, I consulted my chief pigskin advisor.

‘ ‘What we have,” he said, “is a bunch of writers who can look only at

the scores from most of the games. .

»“Like Texas. They’re unranked in pre-season, in the low teens after
beating Boston College in the opener, 44-0, and ninth after destroying
Virginia, 68-0. It's the same team that was completely out of the picture
a couple of weeks ago, but those big numbers impress the voters.”

Did Pitt descend from grace by holding down the score against
William and Mary? A

“I think so,” he answered. “West Coast writers aren’t impressed
with a 28-6 victory over a team like that—Pitt had to show they had an

offense capable of rolling up the score. I know Sherrill said he didn’t

want to do that, but even though you might not like it, you have to do it to
impress the ‘writers who do the voting. ’ ’

What effect will Pitt’s,future schedule have on their ability to get back
in the national championship picture? -

“Teams like Temple, Army and Navy aren’t the toughest teams, ’ ’ my
expert said. “So, in order to move up by beating them, Pitt has to show
total domination of the game—offensively, defensively and particularly
on the scoreboard. ‘ -

“On the other hand,” he noted, “Pitt stillPlws three highly-ranked
teams: Florida, West Virginia and Penn State. They deﬁnitely can use
those games to move up. But they can't afford to look ahead to these
games——Michigan did that last year, and Purdue nailed them.”

It also must be noted that last season, Southern Cal lost its ﬁrst game,
won the ﬁnal 10 and finished a close second to Pitt in the ﬁnal rankings.
It is best to a game—if, indeed, a game must be lost at all—early in the
year, for then a team can work its way up. And it appears that this year
it’s going to be tough for any team to remain undefeated.

Oklahoma must play Ohio State and Nebraska, Michigan meets Ohio
State and the winner of that game probably will meet Southern Cal in the
Rose Bowl. So, Panther fans, take heart——if the players are up for it, and
it appears they are, perhaps the teams presently at the top will cooperate
by spreading the losses around. _

Can Rick Trocano maintain the high standard of play he showed
against William and Mary? I asked my expert.

‘ ‘The most impressive part of Trocano’s game was the way he ran the
option—-absolutely no hesitancy. The quarterback has got to force the
defense to commit itself for the optionto be successful, and Trocano was
making them do that. He’s fast, he's strong and he showed a lot of poise
in the way he followed his blockers. This will be a perfect complement to
Elliot Walker, who has not only been running around and away from
people, but also over a few.” -

Add to this dangerous offense the remarkable play of the defense and
you come up with some solid ground for optimism.

But if the Panthers wish to move to the top, it appears they will have to
come up with victories designed to impress the pollsters.
And although Jackie Sherrill believes a one-point victory over the
Indians was the same as winning 50-0, Pitt must consider the criteria
used by those voters. And like it or not, it seems tl§_at’§ the name of the
tune. ' A

_ BY PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer
There’s an old sports cliche that
the best offense is a good defense.
With a major part of the Pitt football

squad lost to graduation and the—

loss of quarterback Matt Cavan-
augh in the season opener, the
Panthers will have to prove the truth
behind the old saw if they expect a
winning season. And when the
pressure is on the defense, it’s
handy to have a player like Bob Jury
, _

to head that still intact defensive
secondary.

Last season, Pitt had the leading
interceptng secondary in the
country. The unit nabbed 28 passes
and Jury swiped 10 of them alone,
the second highest total in the
nation. One more, hopefully against
Temple, and he’ll set a new record.
Jury made third team all-America
and all-East last year. What’s more,
he loves pressure.

“I like to play under pressure
because it makes us play better,”
the 6-0 senior said. “We can make
things happen.

“The way it was last year, the
defense carried six of 11 games,”
Jury continued. A lot of people were
saying the pressure wasn’t on us
but Ithink it was. They’re going to
rely on the defense a lot now
because the offense was based

around Matt and he won't be here

from two to ﬁve weeks. So the

Piflls Gordon Jones (24), Tom Yewcnc (13) and Elliott Walker (34) scamper for
fumble recovery in last Saturday’s William & Mary game. Although the
Panthers recovered here, it was instances like this that kept Pitt from running
up the score and thus dropping out of the Associated Press’ Top 20 poll.
Srakocic photo

 

pressure’s going to be on us. We're
going to have to cause turnovers.”

The redeeming win over William
and Mary “turned things around”
for the Panthers, Jury feels. “It
determined what kind of team we
are—whether we were going to fall
or pick our heads up.”

“The fact is—all my life I wanted
to be on a number one team,” Jury
said. “It was just a great feeling
being part of it. I’ll tell you, Iwent in
this year with the attitude that I
wanted to win to show people we
could win without Tony Dorsett. I
mean, no offense to Tony—he’s
great, he was a big asset to our team
last.'.year—but everyone said that
Tony was Pitt. But it wasn’t the‘
way. It takes 22 players to win. And
that’s why if we win (big it
would mean just as much to me as
last year.”

Theebig questions surrounding
Jury now are his chances at making
all-American and/or going to the
pros.

 

‘ ‘Everyone would love to become
an all-American,” he shrugged.
“Really, my goal is to have an
exceptional year. If I possibly could,
I’d like to have a better year than
last year. But if it’s just the same,
I’d be satisﬁed. The pros—that’s a
dream everyone works for.”

If dreams don’t come true, Jury?
will opt for a career in line with his
major of criminology.

ProBasketball Dunked?

' In recent years, professional basketball in
Pittsburgh has always been treated as a joke.
Considering the caliber of the leagues in which
the three city pro teams played, this is not
surprising. The renaissance, for example, was
part of a makeshift, eight-team league called the
American Basketball League (ABL). The league
was established in 1961 by Abe Saperstein, then-

owner of the Harlem Globetrotters. At the time, ,

many good players
were not employed

Again, the pro fans were disappointed. When
a club finally did return to Pittsburgh in the early
70’s, it was more of a haunting than a revival.
Although the Condors, as they were called,
played in a league that was steadily making its
way up to the NBA level, the team itself was
bush.

Promotional gimmicks, such as glV€‘q‘3ay‘
nights where fans received ABA basketballs,

did not exactly
enhance public

by the National K
Basketball Associa-
tion (NBA), so the
ABL had its pick of
quality athletes.
The main problem,

dismay of the die-
hard pro fans.

A few years later, the American Basketball
Association (ABA) was established and the
Pittsburgh franchise, the Pipers, was actually
worth watching. Players like Connie Hawkins
(who had been a member of the Rens), Chico
Vaughn and Art Heyman (perhaps the best-
known “superflake” ever to palm a basketball),
kept fans interested in the team, if not the action
down on the court.

Lo and behold, this team actually won the
1968 ABA championship‘. Even more astonishing
was the paid attendance figure of 11,500 for the
Pipers’ title-clincher against New Orleans.

Just when it looked as if the pro game might
have found a home in the Steel City, financial
problems caused the Pipers to move to
Minnesota. The team only drew around 3,500
fans a game, which fell below the break-even
average of 5,000.

were laughable.

The contests were livened up by John Brisker,
one of the few players who had a fan club.
Brisker often would engage in fights, which
usually led to his getting thrown out of the game.
Another player, Mickey Davis, reportedly
munched popcorn while on the bench. Along
with Skeeter Swift, Bob Verga and Mike Lewis,
the Condors floundered into relative obscurity
and existing as quoth the Raven, “nevermore.”

Today, it doesn’t seem likely that pro
roundball will ever return. There is reason to
doubt any attempts to do so——college games have
a tough enough time drawing crowds and the
news media have never seemed particul

interested in the pros. Most of all, someo‘ ., or "

namely an owner, has to be willing to lose a small
fortune investing in such a risky operation.

Anyone have a couple million dollars to spare?

Place I-Tfth At

Youngstown Invite

BY GARY GRAFF

If achievement is measured by
how much one improves, give the
Pitt golf teamhigh marks. In a
ﬁfth-place finish a ﬁeld of 12 at
Monday’s match in Youngstown,
the duffers improved on last year’s

 X performance by 30 strokes.

Led by Bob Kurey’s two-over-par
73, the Pitt squad finished at 390,
only 22 strokes behind first-place
Edinboro. Kurey’s performance
earned him fourth place in the
individual competition.

‘‘I was very pleased by the fact
that they’ve improved,” said Pitt
coach Steve Petro. “We bettered
ourselves by 30 strokes over last
year. When you think that 80
percent of the teams there were

subsidized, our showing is even -

more impressive.”

Pitt’s golf program is not
subsidized, it does not offer

 scholarships and compensation to

its players.

The golf team was rounded out by
Andrew Boyle at 75, Jim McGrath
at 78, Kevin McCarthy at 79 and
Alan English at 85. Larry Smore’s
high score of 90 was dropped.

The Annual Pitt Invitational will
take place this Friday at Cherry
Hills Inn and Country Club in
McDonald, Pa. Twenty top teams
from the East will be on hand for the
competition.

‘ ‘I’d work with juvenile delin-

A private person off the playing

pressure of living in a gold fish bowl
during the season, although he
admits that “at times it kind of gets
to you.”

‘ ‘Sometimes when people come

you, if you’re not in a good mood.
Because people will say, ‘Well, he’s
too good to talk.’ But it’s not like
that. There’s a time and a place for‘
that,” Jury said.

It’s a good thing Jury’s got a
mature outlook, because the
Panthers have a long season ahead
of them. And who’s to say it won’t
be nearly as successful as last
year—after all, the Panthers have
Jury for the defense.

We at Fifth Avenue invite our readers
to open the pages of a new type of
publication at Pitt. The possibility of this
type of magazine has haunted the Pitt
News offices for several years, but only
recently has the right combination of
staff and finances made publication
possible. Fifth Avenue will be published
by the Pitt News, but will offer a
different look at the University and the
surrounding community.

Legislature that repeatedly tried to
renege on financial promises made to:
Pitt when it went state-related.

We may not agree with everything

the Chancellor has done in his 10 years
here, but we would be willing to bet he
has taken those positions that he felt
would benefit both the students and the
corporate structure of the University. A
look at the past 10 years shows a
number of times that the Chancellor has
defended the University’s students
against outside critics. .

A look back also reveals his
mistakes; the times he could have been
more responsive to students’ concerns
and more sympathetic to their needs.

This week’s cover story (see page
6) gives a glimpse into the present as it
takes the reader through one day in the
life of the Chancellor, a man many
people at Pitt‘ do not see after a
handshake during their first week at Pitt.

  A Day and the Life of a Chancellor

By Cristopher C. Hoel

Breaking from a meeting that left him
short on time and into a run for Fifth
Avenue that will leave him short of

A breath, Wesley Posvar makes his

hurried way through a Cathedral of
Learning lobby filled with Iunching
students.

As Posvar steps from the revolving
door and into the wet, chilly afternoon,

.a mid-sized silver Oldsmobile luxury
. sedan pulls into the “no parking” area at

theend of the Fifth Avenue walk.

Pitt’s 15th chancellor is on his way to
a meeting of the WQED board of
directors, of which he is a member.
“This could be interesting,” he says,
rushing for the car. “They’ve been

-doing some great things with public

television.
“And at least,” he continues, smiling,

-“we'll get a free |unch...l hope.”

He reaches the car and takes the
seat next to that of his driver, Bill. “Take
me to Pittsburgh’s most luxurious

hotel,” he says, still smiling, meaning /

theWi||ian Penn.

Bill is aggressive at the wheel,
moving forward with purpose through
heavy traffic, apparently practiced at
transporting Posvar when time is
treasured.

Posvar uses the Fifth Avenue stretch
of the trip downtown to adjust his

. schedule, calling his office with the

telephone that occupies the space
normally reserved for an 8-track stereo.
“Hello?” he says, without identifying
himself. “How does the schedule
look?” He looks out the window,

, thinking. “No, I don't think that will do.

Can you make Dr. Holzner a little later,

‘- Despite the Long Hours,

He ’s Still Ahead of Everyone ’

say 15 minutes? Great. OK. l’l| call on
my way back.” ~

He makes a notation on a small blue
index card that documents the day
before him. “They give me one of these
every day,” he_says. “Comes in very
handy...seems we're always making
alterations.”

The car pulls into a spot directly in
front of the William Penn's front door
and Posvar, grabbing his raincoat,
slides out of the car. “Don’t let me
forget this, all right?” he asks Bill, who
promises to remember. ’

“Give us half an hour,” are his parting
words as he rushes to the lobby.

‘‘I’m not sure of exactly where this
thing is,” he remembers as he
approaches the elevators. From his
many visits, however, he has a good
idea. .

“Seventeenth floor,” he says to
himself, as he enters an elevator.
Apparently his choice is a poor one,
since a push of the button effects no
response. After a second push, Posvar
begins to scan the elevator and the
lobby, seeking a solution. His rapid
glances and thought produce nothing,
however, so he begins to walk out. The
door begins to close.

“Always works,” he says.

¥ 9! -K -I

Were Wesley Posvar to claim he’s
enjoyed every minute of his 10 years as
chancellor at Pitt, one would be wise to

Wesley Wentz Posvar...

’--Born in Topeka, Kansas in 1925, Chancellor Posvar attended . public‘

schools in Cleveland, Ohio;

--Graduated first in his class at West Point in 1946 as an engineering major.
-—He was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University where he earned Masters’
degrees in philosophy, political science and economies.

-—Posvar later was awarded a Masters degree in Public adminstration and a

PhD. in political science from Harvard University.

take him at his word. Not just because

.he’s happy with his job, but also

because every minute is measured in
his carefully constructed, demanding
schedule. .
His mornings begin with a one-mile
run though Shadyside. ‘‘I run to get
winded,” he says, as if he did not know
the remainder of his day would be
enough to exhaust most people.»
His workdayoften stretches well into

the evening or across the country with ‘

meetings, appearances and other work
tucked into each hour. “lt never ends,”
says an aide. “He starts at 10 and often
is still going at midnight.

“But despite the hours, he’s still way
ahead of everyone else.” A

Posvar agrees the schedule is
heavy, but says he enjoys it. “I enjoy
accepting and fulfilling the
responsibility,” he says, “it’s just that
there are always twogor three times as
many important things to do as can be

done in the time available. But I find that‘

makes the job all the more stimulating.” ‘

Posvar was elected Chancellor in
1967 and took office June 1. His
“job,” according to Pitt’s corporate by-
laws, consisted of the
“superintendence, protection and
development of the welfare and
reputation of the University,” along with
all the powers and duties of corporate
president.

His mission, in reality, was to guide
Pitt’s escape from a financial quagmire
that threatened the University’s

Chamber of Commerce in 1 959.

existence. An expansion program
engineered by Posvar’s predecessor,
Edward Litchfield, left Pitt in debt up to
the Cathedral's 40th floor—the entire
building was later used as collateral for a
mucheneeded Ioan—when expected
financial support for that program
evaporated.

“Those were tough times," Posvar

says now, the last of the debt having’7’

been retired recently. “We had to
tighten budgets and run a disciplined
program, but once we had that
accomplished it was easy to move
aheadf’

In the near-decade it took to right
Pitt’s financial course, Posvar also
sought to improve the school’s stature
in academics, athletics and the public
eye. The school was elected to the
American Association of Universities, a
50-plus member group that bases
membership on academic standards
centered around research and graduate
study. The 1976 football team brought

Pitt its ninth national championship an 

its first Heisman Trophy. ‘And, throu
several programs that aid the
community, Pitt has muffled some
criticism from the community, though
not all. ‘

Meanwhile, faculty and students
have double in number; the budget, now
balanced, has tripled, to $200 million.

“We’ve improved,” Posvar says. “I
know we need some fine-tuning, but
things have been accomplished.

“§“3",“ 

Posvar, having found his way to the
WQED meeting, has finished lunch and
has pulled his chair, farthest from the
speaker, away from the table. A

--From 1954 to 1 957, he served as a member of a small long-range strategic

planning staff in the Pentagon.

—-Before coming to Pitt, Posvar was a tenured political science professor at

the Air Force Academy in Colorado.

—He is a trustee of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a

trustee of the Rand Corporation, a director of Eastern Airlines and a director of
several mutual funds affiliated with federated investors, lnc. .

cig‘ar—he allows himself one only
occasionally, while sticking to diet pop
and jogging—is customarily affected in
situations such as this, and Posvar leans
back to listen, with mild interest, about
public broadcasting’s year in Pittsburgh.

After the meeting is adjourned,
Posvar makes the obligatory
reacquaintances and, remembering his
raincoat, leaves quickly.

‘‘I really shouldn't have stayed that
long, but it was so interesting,” Posvar
says, heading for the front door. Once
outside, however, the silver sedan is
waiting across the street. Posvar
reaches for his schedule.

As the driver moves through
downtown traffic, Posvar picks upthe
phone and summons the operator

impatiently. “This thing is incredibly
handy," he says, hand over
mouthpiece. “Saves more time than

you'd believe.”

After reaching the secretary, Posvar
is told of a problem with the afternoon’s
schedule. Burkhart Holzner, chairman
of the sociology department, has a class
at 2 p.m., the time Posvar wishes
to meet him. .

“Does he have an umbrella? Tell him
we’ll meet him with the car and drive him
to class. Five minutes—we’re coming
into Oakland now.”

The driver approaches the Fifth
Avenue side of the Cathedral, asking,
“Are you sure you don't want to go
underneath, sir?” The rain has picked
up and even a short walk would leave
him wet. '

“No, no—that’s another five minutes.
Don’t -have that kind of time,” says
Posvar, leaning forward in the war. “ls
that umbrella in the trunk?”

The driver makes a sharp turn onto
Fifth and into the “no parking” spot. By

the time the umbrella is out of the trunk,

Posvar, trotting, is 30 feet up the
walkway. “Forget it,” he says, “by the
time it's open, we’ll be inside.”

A student recognizes Posvar as he
approaches the revolving door. “Put a
hat on that man,” he laughs, making

Posvar is happy with his job, which,
at Pitt, involves two vastly different
-are_as of administration. He must
oversee the University’s finances, tight
for the past 10 years, while maintaining
Pitt’s standing as a good educational
buy. lt’s a mixture of
phi|osophy—“Tuition should be free to
every student able to do the work,”
he’s frequently H said—and
practicality—tuition has increased in
each of the past three years. _ ’

But juggling academics and

‘ﬁcounting should pose no problem for

Posvar, a man who has "earned five
academic degrees. His
accomplishments (Rhodes Scholar, first
in West Point’s largest graduating class,
Littauer Fellow at Harvard, strategist at
the Pentagon) are of such combined
weight as to threaten to dissipate the
impact of the individual attainment. But,
says Posvar, “each came from a
different time of my life, so |’ve been
able to enjoy and learn from them all.”
Posvar did not come to his current

Qature from a background of wealth.

His father, a newspaperman still
employed in the Midwest moved often
during Posvar’s childhood, though
Posvar’s education came in the
Cleveland schools. ‘‘I still am interested
in journalism and writing,” the
Chancellor says, remembering that “my
father was even jailed by Trujillo once
while on the job in the Dominican
Republic.” _

Never prodded in school, Posvar
says he “always enjoyed learning and
achieving in the classroom.

‘‘I still enjoy it,” he says. “Much of
what I do now is not unlike learning in a
classroom. l have to research, read and
organize information, with the only

 

difference from academics being that

it's on a more specialized level."

Posvar meets Holzner and the
sociology chairman, interested in a
proposed exchange program involving
his department and a European school,
takes the front seat.

“Mervis Hall, sir?” inquires the driver.

.Posvar nods and, once the car has

eased onto Bigelow Boulevard, he
listens to Holzner’s advice on the
proposal.

As the car nears Mervis, Posvar asks

“lt’s _a small

chairman replies. “Today, one of the
students is presenting’ a lecture on
symbolism. Can you stay?”

His schedule says no, but Posvar
says yes.

“l’ve been occupied‘ with things in

this office before,” Posvar says,
apparently referring to a sit-in staged
at Holzner’s office by supporters of an
ousted instructor. ‘‘I’d like to see it

Mrs. Posvar still performs frequently, although she is not singing “half as much

She» rehearses every day, and meets periodically with her voice

arrangements for Posvar’s upcoming
trip to Germany. '
Posvar is introduced to the class
and, taking a photocopied sheet from
the student who is to speak, stands
against the wall. He listens for several

' minutes and then with a glance at his

watch, moved toward the door. ‘‘I'd
love to stay,” he says, “but l’m afraid l’m
running a bit late.’’

Hurrying back to his office, Posvar
arrives comfortably close to schedule.
He holds a meeting with members of an
engineering program’s
discussing Pitt’s chances at a federal
grant for a research center. Since only
one such grant exists per state, Pitt is
competing mainly with Penn State.
Though the men agree Penn State has
wider support across the state, they
believe Pitt can compete because of its
program’s quality. _

Posvar makes-a friendly, “Hi, this is
Wes Posvar, chancellor at Pitt," phone
call to a lawmaker, and delegates
responsibilities for several actions
necessary to Pitt’s pursuance of the
research facility. The meeting adjourns.
Another quick trip downtown takes
Posvar to a reunion and organizational
meeting of a local Eagle Scouts. He has
another appointment in 20 minutes, a
fact known to his host, but when
reminded of his schedule by a fellow
scout, he replies, “Oh, l have plenty of
time.”

, He has 18 minutes to saylgello, have
a few beers, say goodbye and make it
back to Oakland. -

More than one person familiar with

a computer. “He listens to everything,”
one said, “but he always can sift out the
important information and provide a
logical answer that fits the problem.”

“He just thinks faster than everyone
else,” said an aide. “He’s always way
out in front. And I've never known him»
to forget something, either. He may put
it on the back burner for awhile, but
when you think he’s forgotten
something that must be done, you find
he’s taken care of it.”

Posvar is aided in the task of running
one of the country’s largest academic
institutions by a staff led by Dr. Edward
Bozik, his chief assistant,
administrative assistant Helen Knox.
Much of the staff's job is to enable
Posvar to concern himself with issues
that can be considered by no one else.
“We’re here,” said an aide, “to make

substantive matters.”

“That’s partly my personal style,”
says Posvar, “but my job is so wide in
scope that I think it's desirable to beas
involved as l can—sensibIy.

“There is a chance, of course, that I
overdo it a bit.”

His inquisitive streak yields benefits
in other areas, though. He has become

_ something of an expert in many areas

that really are not his field, including
photography, architecture, art and

":1 medicine.

An area in which his thirst for fact

: becomes an asset is that of public

opinion at Pitt. Several student and staff

advisory boards have been established '

during Posvar’s tenure, and senior staff

meetings with his vice chancellors are I

held regularly.

“He wants to be in touch with faculty,
staff and students,” an aide said. “He
wants to know what the prevailing
attitudes are around campus and he
does a pretty good job of it through his
various meetings and so forth.”

Posvar

to

Posvar is sitting at the head of the long
confence table that dpminates the huge
corner of the Cathedral's first floor that
is the chancellor's office. High-
ceilinged and the size of three
classrooms, it is “a little too large for
comfort, but nice for meetings,
receptions and the like,” according to
Posvar.

Around the massive table sit some
dozen of the University's highest
officials. Among them are Bozik, the
vice chancellors, the athletic director
and a representative of the computer
center asked to attend and discuss a
Jolicy matter regarding his area.

As he is wont to do when in his office
with friends or advisors, Posvar" has
removed his green jacket and put on his
glasses. Bozik is at the,Chancellor’s
right side, assisting him with the
agenda. The staff appears relaxed, but
concentrates on the matters being
discussed. Some take notes; no
secretary is present. '

The discussion centers around
details—often requested by
Posvar—and philosophy or direction.
Some of the assembled officials are
silent, others lively in their presentation
of reports. But these people, some of
whom wield tremendous authority in
parts of the University, direct their
attention to Posvar most of the time,
even when talking about themselves.

When a decision is to be made,
Posvar is the man to whom this group of
decision-makers looks. Often, the
decision is merely a decision to
delegate reponsibility for an action or
even for a decision.

Posvar questions when something is
unclear, quick in his interruptions.
When he is talking, everyone listens.

Most matters discussed are serious;
some affecting millions of dollars (the
University's investment program),
others affecting large numbers of
people (the placement service’s recent
performance. The only interruptions,
save Pos_var’s, come when his
secretary silently delivers messages
after traveling a healthy 20 or 25 yards
from the room's entrance.

 

‘I like to be around students —- they
give me some of my happiest moments. ’

One matter that comes up is that of
an agreement that must be signed
outside the United States. Posvar
wonders if the act can’t. be
accomplished on a plane over the
ocean. “lf we flew out past the 12-mile
limit, couldn’t we just do it out there? I
mean, that would save a whole « day.”

‘K ‘K ‘K i

A whole day is an unheard-of period
of time when Posvar’s schedule is being
considered. He deals in minutes, often
running behind. Fifteen minutes is a

considerable block on his agenda,
which often falls to expediency as
university matters press.

Planning almost by necessity, is one
of Posvar’s passions and strengths. He
derives much pleasure by moving past
the necessary bureaucracy, though the
constant battles take their toll.

“l get exhausted sometimes and fall
into bed a bit early, but on the whole I
don't mind the fast schedule.

“lt pays off, it really does,” he

continues. ‘‘I receive tremendous
enjoyment from meeting students and

seeing them come back as happy,
interested alumni...and it’s nice to think
that we've improved.‘ I think we have
improved in the area of providing
education, and there’s~evidence that we
have.”

Posvar is “not content" with his’ work
at Pitt thus far, however, and plans to
add to it.

‘‘I’m going to improve my priorities
somewhat, I hope,” he says. That’s
always a problem in a job like this where
there’s just so much to do. But l’ve
given up things like time to myself and
time with my family while trying to do
other things—-yesterday was the first
day l’ve had completely free in a
month.”

Posvar, having led the University
from the edge of disaster to a relatively
calm existence, is secure in his position
as chancellor.

“l want to stay here as long as I feel
useful and productive,” he says,
implying he’ll make the decision
concerning the time at which his term
will end. «

“Surely there will come a time...but I
can’t see‘that time yet.’’

If and when he leaves his post,
Posvar will be able to pursue one of
several paths.
involving presidencies at other
institutions or perhaps a job in
Washington, but l’ve turned them all off.

“Whatever I do will have to have a lot
of intellectual activity~,” he adds. “And
I’d like to be around students—they give
me some of my happiest moments.”

That combination would seem to
spell out a future as a professor. “That
would be a fulfillment,” says Posvar.
“l’ve always argued that the highest-
ranking position at a university is that of
professor. ‘

“l’d like to do that, and I’d like to do it
here at Pitt. There would be a transition 8

/'

involved—l’drhave to catch up on some97

reading-—but that would be a great thing
to do.”

Posvar, putting his future ‘aside, is
now ready to resume preparations for a
trip to Europe and the days prior to his

departure. ‘‘I enjoy this job,” he says,
preparing to leave. “I enjoy it very
much.

‘‘I'm just impatient to get on with the
future...”
