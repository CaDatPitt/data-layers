PITT OUTPLAYS  CARLISLE, WINNING 10--3.

DEHART’§ RUN

GIVESGAME
T0 VARSITY

The expected happened last Satur-
day, in Pitt’s victory over the Indians.
The score of 10-3 is some what disap-
pointing to those Pitt men who had
anticipated victory by a wider margin;
but the Varsity was e_v.ideiitl_y under
wraps, and the redskins’ failure to
apply harder pressure kept the Blue
and Gold from working too ‘hard.

Penalties ﬁgured largely in the re-
sult. The Indians suffered seldom
from this cause, but one offense cost
them a touchdown, when they were
set back ﬁve yards for offside play
after Calacls pass to Broker had car-
ried the ball over Pitts goal._ Penal-
tise of one sort or another d1d‘In1'1Cll
to keep the Varsity from scoring
oftener, since it seemed that every
long run by a Pitt man was accom-
panied by- a severe penalty for some
infraction of .the rules. . 4

From the local viewpoint, DeHart
was the bright and shining’ light of
the game. The Reynoldsville boy, sub-

 

bing for Williamson, ran the team in

good style, and ran the Indians’ ends

~ almost faultlessly. Pitt’s only touch-

down was at the end of a 27-yard run
by DeHart, in which he eluded nearly
every member of _the Carlislenteam,
On several occasions “Jimmy was

' responsible for substantial gains, and

he was not above essaying a try at
the line.

Hastings and Miller both_performed
well at‘ halfback, and Hastings’ punt-
ing was all that could _be desired.
Collins and Hanley both did consider-
able damage to the Indian me, Col-
lins in particular being har to stop.
Pitt made many substitutions behind
the line, but every combination seemed
to work well. “Steve” Dillon got in
late in the game, and tore up things
in his characteristic fashion. _

For the visitors Calac was the _big
noise, with his powerfuldinebucking.
The Indian fullback, who in the morn-
ing before the game had been elected

' captain in place of Busch, scored Car-

lisle’s only points by means of a field
goal in the ﬁnal quarter, booting it
over from Pitt’s 30-yard mark. Calac
was troublesome all through_the game,
but was especially so early in the sec-
ond quarter, when Carlisle threatened

to demolish the Varsity defense.

Fumbling marred the contest, both
teams being re eated offen_ders‘in this
particular. —he Varsity’s ﬁrst
score came as a result of a recovered
fumble, early in the game. Hastings
punt went over the Indians’ goal, and
the ball was put in play on the 20-
yard line. On the ﬁrst play Broker

. fumbled, and Collins recovered for

Pitt. After three plays had advanced
the ball six yards, Hastings took
Peck’s éss on the 25-yard line and
booted he oval between the bars for
three points. _
After an exchange of kicks Carlisle
advanced the ball to within 15 yards
of Pitt’s goal, where it rested at the
end of the first quarter. After two

’fruitless attempts at the Blue and

Gold line, Calac made a neat pass to
Broker, over Pitt’s goal; but Broker
had taken too early a start, and Car-
lisle was penalized ﬁve yards for off-
side play. Peck and Miller broke up
the play when Calac attempted an-
other forward pass, and Pitt took the
ball. A fumble gave the Indians’ pos-

-session of the pigskin, and Calac tried

for a ﬁeld goal, but missed.
Sensational work by Collins, Miller
and‘ DeHart advanced the ball to the’
Indians’ 27-yard line. Here DeHart
took the ball, and skirted the end be-
hind good interference. Dodging
tackler, after tackler, ﬁnally worming
out of the-grasp of Calac, “Jimmy”
shot over the, redskins’ goal for _a
touchdown, assuring Pitt of its spe-
ondconsecutive victory over the Car-
lisle aggregation. V
Following this touchdown Pitt fought
Carlisle hard, forcing the-Indians to
punt once from behind their own goal
line. The quarter and half ended
with the pigskin in Carlis1e’s posses-
sion, only ﬁve yards away from their
“last ditch.” The last few minutes
of this period was featured by De-
Hart’s beautiful 35-yard return of
Calac’-s punt—-a run which was ma" I
almost vain by a penalty of 25 yards
on a Pitt man. ‘ .
The ‘ third quarter was almost
featureless, being occupied by advan_-
ces and retreats by both teams. Calac

‘again failed in an attempt at a ﬁeld

goal, w_hile Hastings’ two long runs
were both rendered useless by penal-
ties, one for offside and one for hold-

in . -

In the ﬁnal period Carlisle» scored
three points when Calac made good
on his third try at a ﬁeld goal. Fol-
lowing this score Pitt kicked off to
Carlisle, who punted after a few
downs. Pitt began a steady advance
up the ﬁeld, and had the ball on Car-

lisle’s 13-yard line when the whistle

blew, ending the combat.

After watching Lee Collins wade
into opposing linesthe last two or
three Saturdays, we think we know

his guns.

If Pitt should by any chance play
Central High school, we lay odds of
two to one that the score would be
close. This year’s football team can’t
be beaten as a promoter of heart fail-
ure among it supporters. A close
score every Saturday is much too?
much. I

From the Carlisle Arrow, of Oct.
16: “The team left for Pittsburg
this morning and will be up against an
unbeaten team tomorrow———the only
team which was ableato defeat Car-
lisle last year. Not much hope is
entertained of a Carlisle victory.”

Passed by the National Board of
Censorship. ‘

There are no doubt times and oc-
casions when “What’s the answer”?
and the customary response are, if not
appropriate, at least 1-permissible. But
they can easily be spared on occasions
such as last Saturday—three .weeks
before the W. & J. game, with not a
Red and Black fan in sight, and with
the student body linediup on the ﬁeld
as a special exhibition for the crowd.
The newspaper men who criticised
Pitt for this partciular performance
were 99% per cent right.

Somebody spread the report in
Martins Ferry last Saturday, that the
Pitt Freshmen had defeated Greens-
burg the week previous by a score of
105 to 0. Before the high school
authorities could call in the S. P. C. A.
to prevent the certain slaughter of the
local boys, Coach Ammons of the 1918
team issued an 'oflicial denial, and the
game went on. _ ‘ '

If Tech keew on at its present pace,
Pitt mayhave a busy afternoon of it
on November 14. Students who are
commencing to guessat the size of
Pitt’s score that day will do well to
gaze on the result of the Tech-Lehigh
contest last Saturday. '

Anxious Reader——-No, DeHart has
never done the 100 in less than nine
seconds—that is, igootball togs. '

Now that Carlisle has left the city,
Pitt fans may be ,glad to know that
Joe Guyon, the wonderful halfback of
the 1913 Indian team, is expected to
play in the game with Penn this week.
His teammates were looking for the
arrival of the missing Joe last Satur-
day. ’ - '
About the only fault to be found
with Pitt’s backﬁeld in the Indian
game was their proneness to present
too gentle a variety of interference.
Except for Miller, not a man seemed
willing to leave his feet in taking a
ma_n out of the defense. ,

In substantiation of some of the
nice things we have omitted with re-
gard to Pitt’s backﬁeld, we might men-«
tion the fact that “Chalky” William-
son was hardly missed last Saturday.
We know it’s impossible, but it’s true.

1913 TEAM. PLAYS  
THIEL GGLLEGE

To-morrow the undefeated Fresh-
men team travels to Greenville to play,
the formidable Thiel College. The
ﬁrst year men have been practising
faithfully and are in good condition,
Twenty players will be taken along,
and the team will be accompanied by
Coach .A:nmons and Manager Brad-
ford. ’

Just before last‘ Saturday’s game at
Martins Ferry, the Freshmen elected
Stahlman, of Char1eroi., as their capt-
ain. The result lay between Stahl-
-man and Meadows, but the Washing-
ton county man won out. Stahlman
is one of the fastest men in the enter-
ing class, and was captain of his high
school team.

FIRST GAIL FUR

As soon as the installation of the
new tile lining in the pool has been
completed, a call will be issued for
candidates for the Varsity swimming
team. With last year’s team intact,
and with a number of. new men of
established reputation, Coach Taylor
is sanguine of a successful outcome
to the 1914-15 season.

The ﬁrst chance for the Blue and
Gold natators to show will come Mon-
day night, in the open meet held at
the" Oakland Natatonium. Two relay
teams will probably be entered, to be
picked from the following men:
Manager Sweet, '1.‘-anney, Swope,
Buckland, Brown,
Swenson, and Ludwig. McDiarmid is

swimmers will compete in the various
events on the program. Teams will
be entered from P. A. A., Carnegie
Tech, East Liberty Y. M. C. A., Hill
Top Y. M. C. A. and ‘P. A. C., so the
opposition will be of a character ,to
test the Pitt representatives‘ to the

FRESHMAN nuox  
  MEET iouonnow

Tomorrow morning the big Fresh-
man track meet will be held on Trees
Stadium. The program will begin at
10 o’clock and the events will be run
off in rapid succession. Entries have
been pouring in fast and rivalry
promises to be keen. A number of
good men are entered in every event,
and a new University record or two
should result.

Director of Athletics, Charles S.
Miller will be in charge of the most
and will act as referee. Coach Kerr
will be there to look over prospective
candidates for the meets to beheld in
the winter and spring. The student
manager; of the track team and his as-
sistants will act as starters and
timers. u

The material this year ‘is of very
high calibre and includes many prep
school record holders. Members of
the Varsity and Freshman football
teams will not be able to get into the
meet, but will enter track work as
soon as the gridiron season is over.
Some of the better known men who
will be seen in action are Murry, the
Indiana Normal hurdler and pole
vaulter; Applestein and Mays, in the
100; Chapel, with a record of 5-9% in
the high’ jump, and Sutherland, of
Sewickley, in the discus and hammer.
The winner of each event will be pre-
sented with a pair of track shoes.

FRESHMAN TEAM
AGAIN VIGTIIS

Playing with a vim and snap that
there was no stopping, the Pitt fresh-
man team last Saturday defeated the

score of 18 to 0. The result was
never in doubt after the ﬁrst quarter,
although the Pittites had to play their
best ball in order to hold the Ohioans.

Again,-. as in the Aspinwal.l game,
the Pitt backﬁeld carried everything
before them. Time after time Cook
and McClelland hit the line for sub-
stantial gains. The outstanding fea-
ture of the game, however, was the
open ﬁeld running of Meadows and
Capt. Stahlman. The latter especi-
ally, ran the opponent’s ends at will.
Small, wiry and fast, he is a man of
the DeHart type, and by his brilliant

playing‘ did much to run up the score.

The Freshmen scored in the ﬁrst
and again in the third and last quar-
ters. Martins Ferry had an excep-
tionally strong line, andit was only
by the fiercest kind of playing that
the ‘ﬁrst year men scored as they did.
The Buckeyes could not make any-
thing through the Pitt line, and were
continualy forced to punt. It was on
the receiving and carrying back of
thelse punts that Meadows showed up
we . I .
Freshmen’s teamwork showed a
marked improvement over previoug
week’s game. Although the" game
was rough the players received noth-
ing worse than minor bruises.

WHEHEIIS THE PEP
GF YESTERYEAII?

We quote the following» from ‘the
“Dispatch” of Oct. 19:

“The spirit of the Freshman class
at the University of Pittsburg was
put, to the test Saturday and found
not wanting, while at the same time
undergraduates of the three upper
classes failed to stand the test. Dur-
ing the second half if the Indian game
a slight drizzle set in.
the sophs, juniors and seniors, who
occupied the eastern stand, started in
a mad race for shelter. In less than
two minutes the bleachers were prac-
tically deserted, despite the cries of
the cheerleaders to stick. But not so
with the ﬁrst-year-men. They stuck
to their posts. Throughout the entire
second half they kept up their cheers
of encouragement to their standard-
signal‘ announced the close of the game
bearers, and .not_ until the timer’s
did they leave their stand.”

The only objection we have to this
paragraph is that it is true. Some-
thing, we don’t know what, seems to
beradically wrong with the essence
of paprika, which formerly lurked in
the system of Pitt students. This is
especially true of the upper class-
men. In the parade before the game
last Saturday, ﬁve out of every six
men were from the class of 1918.
When the parade formed on the ﬁeld
between halves, only about half the
occupants of the left field cheering
section left their places. There was
little enough cheering at any stage of
the gameybut after the grand entry
into the grandstand, hardly a sound
was audible from the students.

Certainly spirit is not altogether
dead. The Freshman class showed
that they had the punch last Satur-
day.» and‘ will probably continue to
show it, unless their elder brethren
discourage. them. But why in the
name “of common sense should our
“cheering sections” resemble deaf and
dumb conventions; and why should
“parades” consist of six parts Fresh-
men and one part band; and why
should our “rooters” desert the
bleachers as soon as a sprinkle starts ?
Pitt students never did this before,
and they don’t need to begin it now.
Let’s start tomorrow to get back to
the old system.
