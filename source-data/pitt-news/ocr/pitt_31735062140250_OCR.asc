The most important University
functionof the year took place last

The decorations were carried out in
the University colors, a ‘profusion of
pennants adorning the Walls.

Promptly at seven o’clock the long

Lecture by Mr. Bregg Makes;
Deep Impression-Strikes Vi-i
ta] Point of Theatre Question. i

One of the~ most interesting andi
convincing lectures presented to the}

students was delivered last Friday;

morning by Mr. Bregg, dramatic edi-,

tor of the “Pittsburgh Gazette,’
Times,” on the subject of “Thel
Proper Use of the Theatre.” In com-

parison with universities and otheri
institutions, says Mr. Bregg, the the-j
atre has far the greatest drawing:
power. It is a place for amusement,.f
though this is a low and dangerous;
conception, it is a place for stimulat-1‘
ing recreation, but there is growingl
up a vast volume of thought that the:;
theatre is to be considered as an im-,'
portant civic and social factor in the
development of human character. It
is an educational institution, the func—"
tion of which is to mold conduct and
character. The stage is to be the

social problems are to be fought out,
since it reache_s people that the church
and‘ school does not. Mr. Bregg
drew attention to the vulgarity and
indecency which characterizes many

of the dramas that appear on the‘
stage here and made an eloquent and!

impassioned appeal to t-he students toi

do all in their power to use the the-
atre rightly and condemn bad plays.1
The theatre, he says, does more harm!
than the bar—room. 

The speaker thinks we have no!
great actors today as we had twenty-E
five years ago. We have, however,§
many actors who are doing-‘good andé
artisticwork, and the stage is doing;
more now to weld literature and thei
theatre together than ever before. _ I

A remedy for present evils 
Bregg suggests in an alliance,.such asl
exists in a few of our-cities, which
will endeavor to have presented onlyj
elevating and educational plays and{
which will indicate to the public what;
is best, urging or discouraging at-g

dependence of the theatre is the pub—_;

THE THEATER AND THE COL-
_LEGE. MAN.

the "‘Use of the Theater,” by Mr.
Ctliarles M. Bregg, dramatic critic of
the Pittsburgh Gazette Times. The
character of the talk was the power
for‘good and evil that the modern
playhouse has in its possession and
its «consequent effect upon the minds
of the masses. Quiteiapart from the
use made of the theater by the popu-

selection of the college rnian in things
dramatic. Did youever notice a. real,
-live crowd of college men after a foot-
iball victory, form a theater party of
two or three hundred to celebrate the
occasion? Did you see them descend
upon the playhouse offering as its
week’s attraction Ia. very clever in-
terpretation of some Ibsen drama?
The house advertising the

ties is the *mecca of the care-free
youth.of the college. But, that -is an
extreme case. Just a.s an. every-dla.y

that the stage is a force, which is fast
making inroads «into the minds ofthe
people, simply because the time of the

THE PITT WEEKLY.

Official Football Schedule Containing .

!

Eight Games is Announced;
3

Cornell, Notre Dame, Carlisle Indians, W. & J. and State?

Appear on Most Excellent Schedule Arranged ' by Man-1

ager Hurst. -

Graduate Manager Lawrence B.
Hurst formally announced the 1911
football schedule last week, and from
a standpoint of relative merit it is
the best card in the -history of the
University. Eight games are in-
cluded in the list, seven of them be-
ing signed for, and negotiations are
still pending for the other contest.
All the games are played at home,

_with one exception, the Cornell en-

gagement, it "being arranged" for

Ithaca.
The schedule contains but two of

the so—called minor struggles, and in '

fact one" of them, the Westminster
game, can scarcely -be included in that
category, as the New Wilmington

‘line-up fought the hardest of any of

the elevens encountered last fall. The
season opens on October 7 and closes
on Thanksgiving Day, November 30,
with the annual Pitt-State ‘contest.
Westminster College is the opening
attraction, appearing here on the
7th of October, followed one week
later by Buchtel College. of Akron,
Ohio. Little is known of the latter
team, except that_the championship
of Eastern Ohio was ‘awarded them
last season. VVith the two prepara-

tory brushes over, the remainder of-

the season is a succession of “big”
games, beginning with the Indians on
the 21st of October, and in rapid or-

der Cornell, Notre Dame, VV. & In
and State College.

Regarding the open date, Manager
Hurst, in conversation with a repre-
sentative of the VVeekly, said: “I
have about concluded negotiations
with a11 eastern college for that day,
but at the present moment I am un-
able to divulge the name of the in-
stitution.” When questioned concern-
ing the Penn game, Mr. Hurst replied
as follows: “I have been negotiating
for that ‘game since last November,
and we simply could not get it.”

It will be seen the official schedule
tallies identically with the prediction
made last week in these columns.

Manager Hurst has given the Uni-
versity~a schedule that is a credit to
the institution and himself, for which
the Weekly heartily lauds the ener-
getic graduate manager. It now de-
volves upon the students to whoop

things up for the 1911 team—the

eleven which will defeat the following

colleges in the respective dates given

below: '
October 7, Westminster College.
October 14, Buchtel College.

- October 21, Carlisle Indians.
October 28, Cornell "University.

DEBATE NEXT FRIDAY NIGHT.

 

Intercollegiate Debate to be Held In
Conjunction With High School"
Reception. Allegheny Col-

. lege, Here.

The annual intercollegiate debate
between the colleges of Vi/estern
Pennsylvania and Ohio will take place
next Friday evening a week, in the

‘ assembly room of Thaw Hall. The

event this year will be held in con-
junction with the reception given the
High and Preparatory schools of this
section. Allegheny College will be the
opponents of the University, while
the other section of the Pitt debaters
will clash with Wooster at Wooster.

The subject for discussion is, “The
Income Tax,” which at the present
moment is arousing considerable in-
terest over the nation.

The arrangement of the debate in
c-onnection with the reception
good idea as it insures debaters a
large audience, which otherwise would
not hear the argument.

Basketball for the season of 1910-11 M
is fast drawing to a close. most of-the 
important games have been played,i
and but two more remain on the?
schedule. Hiram College plays herel
this comling Saturdnay evening in the;
second game, of the series. The Uni-E

versity team met defeat a few weeks.
ago at the hands of the Ohio team,5

but it is not likely the act will be re-  ‘

peate-d as the Blue and Gold will be!
in good shape for the coming gameu
Captain Weger will be in the lineup}
again, which will give the players;
more conﬁdence in their ability. f

On the seventeenth of March the}
ﬁnal game of the year takes place with 
Waynesburg college as the opponents l
of the University. The strength ofg
the Greene’ county‘ collegians is not 
known, but it may be expected their!
team is fast and light.
