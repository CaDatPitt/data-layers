In short, they are making a
movie of the entire production of
“Golden Boy” by Clifford Odets.

From now until the opening night,
March 19, the cast will be heeding
“cut” and “action” while the scen-
ario writers and photographers
struggle with close-ups and lap dis-
solves.

When ﬁnished, the movie will be
a complete record -of the production
of a play, from the time it is un-
wound from Odets’ typewriter till
the opening night at Foster memor-
ial. Technical aspects, including
the building of scenery, properties,
publicity, and ticket selling, will be
presented in detail.

In making the movie, the Players
will be doing no more work than
is required in the ordinary produc-
tion of a regular, full-length play.
Technical work for “Golden Boy”
will be done by student technicians
under the direction of Frank Mason.
technical director. Properties will
be handled by Jane Lintleman,
Ed42, and publicity by Alvin Glass,
BA42.

Second semester fraternity rush-
ing period will officially begin at 8
o’clock tomorrow morning, an-
nounces Alvin Ludwig, BA41, presi-
dent of Interfraternity council.

However, before the rushing pe-
riod begins, Ludwig cautions fra-
ternity men to observe strictly the
pre—rushing rules.

Prior to the rushing period to-
morrow, no iraternity member or
pledge is permitted to approach new
students on any phase of fraternity
matters, invite him to the frater-
nity house, or entertain him in any
way. This rule is enforced so that
no fraternity can induce a prospect
before the other fraternities have
their chance during the regular
rushing period.

The rushing period will end at 2
o’clock Sunday morning at which
time the silence _period begins,
states Robert Corley, assistant dean
of men.

The silence period, in which fra-
ternities submit sealed bids for can-
dates to the dean of men, will end
Wednesday evening, February 26,
at 5 o’clock.

During this period, in which can-
didates will be called up to the dean
of men’s office to be questioned as to
their choice, fraternity members or
pledges are not permitted to ap-
proach in any way the newly regis-
tered and rushed students.

Roberts Calls
SFA Meeting
For Tonight

Debate on Revisions
To Occupy Evening

With the postponement of its
regular scheduled meeting of a
week ago still veiled in political
mystery, SFA will meet this eve-
ning at 8 o’clock on the twelfth
ﬂoor. Chief reason for last week’s
postponement, according to Joe
Roberts, BA4l, president, was the
constitution committee’s inability to
make a deﬁnite report.

Dave Tucker, C41, vice president
of the organization and chairman
of the constitution committee, claim-
ed, however, that the deferment was
due to an anticipated drop in at-
tendance at the meeting, rather
than the failure of the committee to
produce a report.

Revision of Constitution

At tonight’s meeting the most
signiﬁcant piece of business will be
centered around Tucker’s report on
revision of the SFA constitution.
“Although the constitution is still
not ready for ratiﬁcation,” said
Tucker, “steps along certain lines
have been taken, which should prove
the basis for a discussion in which
SFA members may offer suggestions
to the committee.”

The ﬁrst major revision in the
constitution, according to Tucker,
will be a clause granting represen-
tation to the various student activi-
ties. This, he believes, will bring
SFA closer to the activities and
their problems.

Second innovation in the new con-
stitution will call for the removal
of the faculty members from the
assembly. The dean of men and
the dean of women will retain their
positions on the executive commit-
tee, however. If the faculty remov-
al clause 's adopted by the mem-
bers, the organization will have to
change its name to one other than
Student Faculty association.
Committee Training __

The ﬁnal innovation in the docu-
ment suggested by the committee
recommends a training program for
personnel in the committee of the
organization. This would initiate
a system of “political apprentice-
ship” in SFA, whereby committee
chairmen are to have served on their
particular committee for some time
prior to their appointment.

“These suggested items constitute
goals, rather than actual ends with-
in themselves,” commented Tucker.
“We know what we are setting out
to do, but the actual methods and
laws by which we can accomplish
our purposes are still somewhat
hazy.” A

SFA statistics committee, under
the chairmanship of Tom Grogan,
BA42, is at present conducting a poll
to gather questions that are to be
asked of Chancellor John G. Bow-
man, at the ﬁrst Chancellor's as-
sembly, a week from Friday.

this afternoon, don’t you think?

Dr. Wendell Otey, Pitt Composer, Recommends
Coffee, ot Towels for Enterprising Musicians

The young man with the baton
was good.

When he descended the podium,
the ovation was terriﬁc.

He did Pitt proud.

Now, Dr. Wendell Otey, instruc-
tor in music appreciation who con-
ducted the Pittsburgh Symphony
orchestra on February 7 and 9 in
his own composition “V£11‘iati0I1S
for the Orchestra,” at Syria Mos-
quc, has compiled a rather unique
set of rules for composing music.

First. he recommended coffee and
hot towels.

“They’re apt to come in more
handy than white tie and tails,” he
explained. “Especially if you write
a piece for orchestra, where you not
only compose the music and prepare
a conductor’s score showing what
part every instrument is supposed
to play, but also copy separate parts
for each player.”

It’s a back-breaking job to copy
by hand all those separate parts, Dr.
Otey declared. “You get a won-

derful case of writer’s cramp, in
addition to burning plenty of mid-
night oil.”

“Then there’s proof-reading,” Dr.
otey went on to say. “You’ve pre-
pared the conductor’s score and
copied off the players’ parts, but
you’ve probably made some mis-
take such as leaving out ten meas-
ures of the clarinet part or writing
a couple of trombone notes on the
wrong line.”

You really have to be on your
toes.

If you haven’t corrected these
mistakes by the ﬁrst rehearsal, the
composer continued, you’re in for
some choice surprises: Clarinets
vani:h into thin air at the place
where you wrote a nice tune for
them, and the trombones come in
with a “messy discord.”

When this happens a composer is
very likely to tear his hair while
the musicians swear and try fran-
tically to patch up their mistakes
with the right notes.

It’s no fun.

After you've had a minor brain-
storm composing a piece, produced
a hen—egg on the inside of your
middle finger copying it, sat up till
six a. in. a couple of times reading
proof, and soaked yourseii to the
skin at rehearsals trying to whip
the piece into shape, then getting
into a stiff shirt and tails offers no
difficulties.

Asked whether he was nervous
on the podium at the ﬁnal perform-
ance, Dr. Otey pooh—poohed the
idea.

Said he, ‘‘I had the easiest job of
anyone. All I did was wave the
stick: the men did the playing. The
finest conductor in the world can
have his performances sabotaged
if an orchestra takes a notion to do
it. The Pittsburgh men did a swell
job for me. They didn’t miss a
cue.”

Regarding future compositions,
Dr. Otey smiled and thumped a very
loud discord on his piano.

“Wait a while,” he pleaded, “I'm
still recovering from this one.”

Accomplishments

Famous for his work in photome-
try, science of measurement of
light intensities, Dr. Jordan was di-
rector of the Allegheny observatory
since 1930 and professor of astron-
omy since 1920, when he was also
assistant director of the observa-
tory.

“Dr. Jordan was a man who
worked on star-1evels,” declared
Chancellor John G. Bowman. “By
his colleagues in the University he
was held in highest respect for his
character, his scholarship, and for
the charm of his personality. He and
Mrs. Jordan had become, as it seem-
ed, permanent ﬁxtures at the Uni-
versity. They will both be greatly
missed.”

Active Scholar

Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, dean of
the college, said, “Dr. Jordan repre-
sented the best in University life.
An active scholar, he had broad in-
terests, and kept a ﬁne sense of per-
spective.

“His valued contributions to sci-
ence added to the reputation of Al-
legheny observatory for accurate
and signicant work.

“He enjoyed meeting with his
colleagues and exchanging view-
points with workers in other ﬁelds.
He was interested in the whole pro-
gram of the University, and in the
cultural life of the community as a
whole.”

A Slight Case
(If Suppression

WE THOUGHT for a while that maybe all
those liberals who were hollering about free
speech were stretching the point a little until
we chanced to read the Congressional Record.

In Washington the other day a slight case of
suppression occurred.

In the process of re—electing the Dies com-
mittee to its third term, the remarks of a mem-
ber of Congress were struck from the record.
These remarks were not ﬂattering to the major-
ity on the Dies committee, it is true, although
many other congressmen have been accused of
consorting with fascists or with fascist ideas be-
fore without suppression resulting.

Mr. Dickstein of New York was granted ﬁve
minutes in which to address the house in oppo-
sition to the bill. But his remarks were ex-
punged from the Congressional Record.

A representative from the most backward
state in the union—Mississippi—had the colossal
nerve to stand up on his hind legs and say out
loud where everybody could hear him, “Mr.
Speaker, we are not going to stand for every-
thing . . . I move to expunge the entire speech
of the member from New York from the Rec-
ord . . .”

Mr. Dickstein had said, and the gentleman
from Mississippi was riled by, the following:
“I also charge, Mr. Speaker, that 110 Fascist or-
ganizations in this country had the back key,
and have now the back key to the back door of
the Dies committee.”

Mr. Dickstein had also charged that the com-
mittee had violated the Constitution and the
Bill of Rights. And his remarks were censored
-—-suppressed—with aid of the parliamentary
maneuvering of speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas,
who by the way comes from the same state as
Dies. Just a coincidence, probably not.

Our stand is that this suppression is a sup-
pression of free speech, a suppression of criti-
cism of fascism in America as well as a sup-
pression of valuable information.

It is beside the point whether or not Mr. Dick-
stein could prove the validity of his statements.
The point is this: whether a member of Congress
can or cannot say in the halls of Congress and
have printed in the Congressional Record what
he believes without subjecting his words to the
censorship of a poll-taxer from Mississippi.

And the issue is even more complicated than
this. To accuse a committee supposedly investi-
gating un-American activities of indulging in
these same un-American activities is a serious
charge and should not be suppressed. If the Dies
committee is adopting the methods of fascism
we want to hear all about it and we don’t want
it covered up now, only to have the inner rot-
tenness exposed too late. And considering some
of the company Mr. Dies and the majority on
the committee keep, Mr. Dickstein’s statement
has a ring of authenticity not to be overlooked.
Then too something must be wrong when half-
fascist Cox of Georgia defends the committee.
This attempt to allay criticism of the committee
shows that somebody is afraid of having some-
thing come out.

We can’t excuse this act of suppression merely
because the statements happened to hurt the
feelings of poor Mr. Dies. Deliberate suppres-
sion of a popular source of information is a damn
fine thing to go on in a democracy which may
soon ﬁght in the defense of free speech.

Free speech is the most precious of all our
rights. From free speech flow all the possibili-
ties of democracy. We youth are very jealous
of this right, for ourselves, and for others, so
that we in turn may enjoy and live by it. That’s
why we’re quibbling now. If we don’t maybe
we’ll never get another chance to.

The Pitt News

A Man and a School;

Stairway to the Stars

IN THEIR COMMENT upon the passing of
Dr. Frank C. Jordan, the downtown papers com-
mitted a technical error.

Dr. Jordan, they said, was the director of
Allegheny observatory and a professor at the
University of Pittsburgh. Actually, the observa-
tory is a part of the University, as much so as
are the Cathedral and its surrounding buildings.

, The error is more than an omission of fact.
Itiis a failure to recognize the signiﬁcance of the
University; it is an ignoring of the value of men
like Dr. Jordan.

The University sends its arms around the
world. It begins in the area bounded by Forbes
street, Bigelow boulevard, Fifth avenue, and
Belleﬁeld avenue.

It extends outwards into the cobblestone
streets of China.

This it “has accomplished through the activi-
ties of the men it sends forth. Of these ~.men,
Dr. Jordan was one of the greatest and his work
was among the most important.

He was a dreamer, in the tradition that is
Pitt.

He was one of those who believe that a man
may be old at 50 or young at 75. Another sun-
set, to him, was but the token of a new day yet
to come.

Too many there are who, old in years, live
by habit, conducting themselves mechanically,
treading the beaten path.

Frank Jordan conformed to no such strict
regimen. He worked whenever the impulse
struck him, and that was often enough to make
him great.

His was a timeless philosophy. In the young

ones about him he saw no great variation from
the ways of the young ones of his own day.

He is gone now, gone, perhaps, out to those
stars he studied and loved. One fact remains.
He brings to them no contribution greater than

Success or Flop
--It’ll Be Colossal

INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION which was
organized last Friday, will seek oiﬁcial recogni-
tion from SFA executive committee tomorrow.
It can be one of the most successful ventures
ever attempted on campus. It can be one of the
most colossal flops. This will depend on two
things: the attitude of independent leaders and,
the reception granted the new group by frater-
nity spokesmen.

lf president Robie and company administer
their organization as a constructive association
giving to the streetcar students the tangible
beneﬁts of a social group, they will be satisfying
a need which has been long apparent on the Uni-
versity campus. Under these circumstances the
organization may have a fairly decent chance of
surviving.

If Independent association, however, is or-
ganized simply to buck the fraternities, simply
as a political medium to pour forth invective
criticism, the association will kill itself before it
gets started.

The constitution drawn up for the Inde-
pendent association sets up the group as a con-
structive social and educational organization, de-
signed for those students who cannot afford to
go fraternity. Greek letter men must realize
that such an organization is entirely compatible
with their houses and will in no way interfere
with their present program. Fraternity men
will not be cutting their own throats to assist
their less ﬁnancially-stable fellow students. In
fact, they will be revealing themselves as true
representatives of the fraternalism of which their
charters so proudly boast.

We sincerely hope that Independent associa-
tion will succeed. It can if its leaders recognize
the difference between non-fraternity men and
anti-fraternity men.

Personalized lIistory--

Yarnell, Benes, Koo

TODAY’S MARCH OF EVENTS is double
timing through the University with Monday’s
campus appearance of Czech-leader Benes, with
today’s inspection-tour of Admiral Yarnell, and
with a rumored visit next week of T. Z. Koo,
Chinese biggee.

All of these men have acted in the sometimes
tragic, sometimes brave, always momentous in-
ternational scenario of the past few years. Benes
saw his country sold down the river Danube to
Germany. Yarnell, one-time commander of the
Asiatic ﬂeet, is the sailor-diplomat who helped
keep Nippon from running completely amuck,

while Koo has been and is one of the leaders of
embattled China.

The University appearance of these three not
only helps lighten the bloody mystery that is
the world today, but also lightens the criticism
that has been directed at the school policy to-
ward speakers. If speakers of the caliber of
Benes, Yarnell, Koo continue to ascend Univer-
sity lecture platforms, there can be few justiﬁed
complaints that the University, as far as speak-
ers are concerned, is a cloister.

  
   
   

The last of the unreconstructed
rebels, Henry Ford, still carries on
his single-handed struggle to thwart
the wheels of social progress.
Adamantly. he continues to ﬁire
workers for union activities. He
still retains a former convict to di-
rect thugs and strong-arm bullies
to enforce company “policy.” Con-
temptuously, he ﬂouts federal law
and seeks to evade social responsi-
bility through a maze of court ap-
peals and counter appeals.

This man, whose industrial organ-
ization is synonymous with effi-
ciency and modernity, takes pride
in his eighteenth century attitude
toward labor. He calls himself an
individualist. He spurns workers
appeals for freedom to unionize.
“Any man who has a grievances
can straighten _it out with the boss,”
he says. ~Meanwhile terror and fear
pervades his plants. One hundred
and twenty thousand workers are
denied the simple prerogative of or-
ganizing and choosing representa-
tives for collective bargaining.

0 Farmer Ford

In his social outlook, Henry Ford
is pathetically provincial. His phil-
osophy, plain as spit and tobacco,
reﬂects the views of a back-country
farmer who never went outside his
hundred acre farm. He is obsessed
with innumerable prejudices and
peeves which dominate his limited
intellectual horizon. He hates

unions.
bankers. He dislikes “school-E>re‘~”

international

people. He blames the present war
on international bankers, and so he
refuses to manufacture planes for
Britain.

Old-fashioned to the core, and
ﬁercely intolerant of differing be-
liefs and groups, he ruthlessly push-
es others around in his pursuance
of “rugged individualism.”

At this moment the question of
what to do with Henry Ford is of
paramount significance. America is
dead-set on a gigantic program of
rearmament. We must produce
guns, tanks, planes, and ships at
once. And we know that the Ford
plants stanl out as a mighty poten-
tial source of armament supply. If
turned over to armament construc-
tion, these plants could supply Bri-
tain and ourselves with a vital in-
exhaustible arsenal.

O Brooding Oveir New Deal Eggs

But Henry Ford broods. He
broods over New Deal reform laws.
He broods over America’s policy of
aid to Britain. He looks askance at
the rising tide of unionism. And
because he ﬁghts industrial democ-
racy in his plants, our government
must delay and revoke defense con-
tracts.

Of course the Supreme court
gradually imposes a certain labor
minima upon Mr. Ford. But even
in the face of judicial pronounce-

Henry Ford: The Last: Rebel
Recognized No Appomattox

ments, Henry Ford technically bows
to the law b t evades its spirit. He
re-employes the 30 workers ousted
for union activity, but subjects these
workers to such discriminatory and
humiliating conditions that they
gladly leave of their own volition.

O Obstructs Defense

I’m afraid that America has pass-
ed the stage where one man can be
allowed to obstruct a major nation-
31 Drograrn. Because Mr. Ford is
an “individualist” is not reason
why the American people are going
to cast aside their concepts of social
morality in preference to the out-
moded rule of tooth and claw. Cer-
tainly our government must not
grant defense orders to a company
determined to smash free unionism.

Whether Henry Ford is plain
dumb or deliberately brutal in his
social philosophy, I don’t know. But
I do now that*the Ford plants must
at once begin armament production
under twentieth century labor
standards. This country is deter-
mined to defend its freedom. And
this country will not revoke its so-
cial gains to cater to a choleric old
man. Should Mr. Ford accommo-
date himself to these speciﬁcations,
well and good. If Mr. Ford can’t go
along with America, then America.
must do its duty by operating the
F0111 plants for the defense and
freedom of America.

It looks as though the punch that Floyd “Scotty” Hamilton
of “last Virginia threw at Pitt’s Eddie Straloski last week was an

expensive one.

The Mountaineers announced Saturday that Ham-

ilton has been suspended from basketball competition for the dura-

tion of the season.

cident, we think that \Vest Virginia's disciplinary move was rather

So far as we know. Hamilton was not usually a trouble-
His KO wallop on Straloski’s jaw was his ﬁrst offense of

Add to this the consideration that Hamilton was playing at
top speed in a fast, close game and that he was playing opposite a
man who occasionally gives his opponents cause for annoyance, and
his slip seems less unjust-iﬁable. We realize that swinging from the
ﬂoor should be limited to the boxing rin.g, but we also consider
suspension a pretty stiﬁ punishment.

After the game Hamilton apologized to Straloski and seemed

genuinely sorry for his act.

There was no bitterness over the in-

cident’ among members of either team; neither Pitt men nor coach
Carlson hold a grudge against the \Nest Virginians.

Regardless of whether or 11ot the suspension was justiﬁed,
VVest Virginia deserves credit. for carrying out the move at the
expense of their own team. Hamilton was not only a regular but
a valuable ﬂoor man and a good shot, and his absence will hurt

the Mountaineers’ chances in future games.

Several times they de-

faulted the heavyweight match, relying on lighter men like Ralph
Dorand., Ralph Caruso, and Ray Bombe for enough points to win.
But on one occasion footba.ller Ted Schmidt fought as a Pitt

lieavyweight.

The story is brief. Schmidt was at least 25 pounds overweight,

his Temple opponent only about 15 pounds out of shape.

Both

big boys waved at each other futilely a few times and then the Tem-
ple boxer caught big Ted with a backhand. Theodore did a back-
flop and got’ up at the count of ﬁve. The Temple man laid one glove
gently against Ted ’s cheek and let go from about 18 inches out with
the other hand. The entire extra 25 pounds jumped a foot, and the
ﬁght was over in slightly more than a minute of the ﬁrst round.

Sammies Hope to Gain Victory
Against Wcalscncd Piiam Sguad

Sporting the best record in intra-
mural basketba.ll, Sigma Alpha Mu
will strive to retain their clean
slate tomorrow night when they
square off against a disappointing
Pi Lambda Phi team.

Opening the season with three
straiglit victories, the Pilams looked
like a championship contender, but
successive defeats by Lambda Chi
Alpha and Phi Epsilon Pi left them
high and dry in the second division.

The Sammies ﬁnished the first
half of the league play leading their
closest contender by a full game.
This was achieved when they pulled
one of the biggest surprises of the
season by beating the Phi Kap team
in a close game.

“Specs” Greenberg, Marty Fa-
berman, and Lenny Wolk have car-
ried the burden of the Pilam at-
tack thus far this season, and should
be the ones to bear watching.

For the undefeated team, their
Colton - Abramovitz-Frank- Mayer-
White combination is tops for
ﬁnesse in defensive play. This game
is scheduled to start at 8o’clock in
the Stadium.

Sharing the spotlight with the
SAM-Pilam game will be the tilt
between the second place Phi Gam
team and the second division Phi Ep
team.

The Phi Eps should put out all
they have tomorrow night for they
have nothing to lose, and a lot to
gain if they win. The Fijis need
this game to remain in the running
for the championship trophy.

Pitt Track and Field Troupe
Meets Michigan Friday Night

Although coach Carl Olson’s in-
dividual track and ﬁeld stars have
been turning in some scintillating
indoor performances, his entire
troupe makes its first team per-
formance this Friday night at Ann
Arbor where the Panthers attempt
to score their second straight upset
over mighty Michigan.

Last spring an underdog Pitt
squad rose to the heights in their
test with Michigan and scored a
brilliant 67-64 triumph over the fa-
vored Wolverines before a capacity
crowd. An avenging squad of Big
Ten champions will attempt to keep
the Blue and Gold thinclads from
duplicating this upset.

The task of the Panther spiked-
shoe brigade took on a more fore-
boding aspect last Saturday when
Hap Stickel, the fair haired boy in
last spring’s win, pulled a muscle
in the ﬁnals of the New York AC
60,-yard sprint. Stickel was being
counted on heavily for points in the
dashes, low hurdles, and mile relay.
His status remains doubtful, but
trainers Howard White and Bill
Smith hope to have him ready for
Friday’s fray.

Bullet Bill Carter will bear the
brunt of the sprint chores, if Stickel
is unable to compete. Carter’s chief
competition will come from Bud
Piel and Bob Ufer, a Pittsburgh
district boy who smashed every
Michigan freshman record at 220‘
yards to 830 yards last spring.

The speedy Ufer is also the Maize
and Blue’s best entry in the 440,
and with teammate Jack Leutritz
should make things very tough for
Larry Tregoning, Bud Graf, and
Regis Larkin: Warren Breidenbach,
Michigan’s crack senior quarter-
miler, has not been competing with
the squal and will probably not be
in the lineup this week either.

In the half-mile the Panthers
stand an even chance of winning
the event, for Del Anderson, the
long-striding senior has been show-
ing the best indoor form of his ca-
reer. He has been running fast
races as anchor man on the mile

Now the Doctor Says He’s

relay team, and last week clipped
off a 33.9 two lap dash, the fastest
run in the Pitt track house this
year. Sophomore Bob Davis has
yet to hit his top form in the half.

Inexperience will probably cost
the Panthers ﬁrst and second place
in the mile. Marcus Allias, sopho-
more cross country star, has yet to
run the kind of race he is capable
of; his lack of pace judgment is his
chief fault. Zeke Sterner, the plug-

ging senior distance star, is a good
ﬁrst place bet in the two mile. He
turned in a 10.06 last week under
most unfavorable conditions.

In the ﬁeld events, Carter can
hold his own in the broad jump;
Dave McDowell ﬁgures to do no
better than second against Dan
Canham, Big Ten champ, in the
high jump Dusty Rhoades and Red
Jessup have a good chance of plac-
ing one-two in the pole vault.

Swimming Team Topples Lions

Brady. Brady’s brilliant shooting
was all that saved the Yellow Jack-

Something ought to be done about
the physical hazards of the Stadium

accurate distribution of posts. one

present danger that a player will
ride clear into the wall on a scrim-
mage under the basket.

George Kocheran, Sam Milane-

been banged up this year in battles
with the walls of the Stadium court.
Three accidents are three too many.

Saturday, February 22, the

Disintegration. Kills

Votja Benes Presents Plans

F or Federated Middle Europe

Q By IRVVIN C. ROSEN

Disintegration killed the democ-
racies. A union following a desir-
able outcome of this war is the only
thing that will protect them in the
future!

Presenting an impassioned plea
for a united Europe to protect the
“rights and independence” of the
smaller nations, Senator Votja
Benes, Czechoslovakian statesman
and brother of Dr Edouard Benes,
former president of Czechoslovakia,
told one of Pitt Town meeting’s
largest audiences that such a union
was “demanded by history and
sanctioned by tradition.”

“The primary purpose of union
is that of defense, not of conquest
or aggression——and that purpose
will remain so throughout the ages,”
Senator Benes said. “The small na-
tions of central Europe, disunited
anti squabbling among themselves
for centuries, have in the past found
themselves easy targets for the
Turks and Germans who have

been constant aggressors throughout

history,” he added.
Union Principle ,

“This union is no dream of the
future, it is rather a lesson from the
past,” Senator Benes declared, “for,
in 1526, after the nations had been
united for a time in protection
aga.inst the Turks and Prussians, it
vms the ‘divide and rule’ campaign
of the Hapsburgs that subjugated
'=m. The union principle worked
tl1“n.« It can work now.”

The plan proposed by Senator
Benes calls for a federal union of
approximately twel.ve of Europe’s
smaller nations whose geographic
positions lie from the Baltic to the
Aegean. The nations would be di-
vided into three regional divisions:
a ‘5Vestern bloc, a Central sector,
a1:=:l a union of the Balkans.

Section Members

The western area, including such
nations as Belgium, Holland,
Sweden, Norway, and Denmark,
would have thirty million members.
The central section would include
Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary,
and Rumania, and, l.inked close to-
gether to the Balkan states, could
produce a solid front of over one
hundred million people.

“The ﬁrst move in any union
plan,” Senator Benes explained, “is
a Czechosolvakian-Polish alliance.
This alliance was declared neces-
sary for the welfare of both nations
by Thomas Masaryk in his book,
‘The New Europe,’ but, before
Munich, an over-conﬁdent Poland
spurned Czech proposals for the
union. The tragic fate of both
countries is the result.”

Predicts Victory

Although the Czechoslovakian
statesman held the audience in rapt
attention throughout the speech by
his deep, moving sincerity, he was
never more eloquent than when he
spoke of his own country and its
fate.

“We were prepared to ﬁght in
1938,” he said, “our armies were
.eq_uipped, for we Czechs have al-
ways had to live in fear of a Ger-
ﬁman attempt to conquer us. The

iv/orld put Hitler’s promise of peace

;-against the struggle for life of the
Czech nation and we see the tragic

result in every newspaper article
that comes from Europe.”

As vehement as he was in his ap-
peals for help to Czechoslovakia,
Senator Benes was equally as arous-
ing in his bitterness against Ger-
many. He declared, “I know that
the democracies are going to win
this war. Just as a man canal-
ways defeat a beast, so will the
forces of right demonstrate that the
truth shall prove victorious.”
Votja’s Brother

The speech, serious as it was,

was not without it.s humorous mo-
ments. When William Hammaker,
executive secretary of the YMCA.
introduced Senator Benes he called
him “ the brother of Dr.
Edouard Benes, president of Czech-
oslovakia . . . ” In his introduc-
tion, Senator Benes declared, “I am
not the brother of Edouard. He is
my brother. I am older and bigger
than he is, whereas he is only
greater than I am.”

Still on another instance, when
Senator Benes fumbled momentar-
ily for a word, he excused himself
saying, “Ah well, good-will is more
important than good English!”

Poll Indicates
Student Desire
To Study ‘Isms’

By Student Opinion Surveys of America

AUSTIN, Tex., Feb. 19.-—If dem-
ocracy is to be safeguarded, it is
important and necessary that Amer-
ican colleges and universities teach
the youth of the nation the facts
about foreign “isms” that threaten
the world today. That is the opin-
ion of two-thirds of collegians the
country over, reﬂected in a scienti-
ﬁc manner through Student Opin-
ion Surveys of America.

The Pitt News is one of the spon-
soring undergraduate newspapers,
that make possible. the accurate
measurement of American collegiate
thought. The polls are conducted
locally by each ‘newspaper by
means of representative sampling,
and the national returns are then
tabulated at the Survey’s head-
quarters at the University of Texas.

The European debacle has forced
attention on a long—evaded problem:
how to inform Americans of totali-
tarian ideology and at the same time
not endanger ou.r democratic insti-
tutions. “Stop teaching these
‘isms’ in our colleges” has been
the demand most often heard. But
men of greater discernment have
questioned the wisdom of prohibit-
ing ‘ instruction in these forms ‘of
government. What do students
themselves think about this, they
who are actually taking the courses‘?
Should the colleges continue to pre-
sent “the facts about communism,
socialism, naz.i!'sm, and fascism?”
With that question Surveys inter-
viewers approached a cross section
of collegians. Here are the answers:

NO, do not teach them . . . . . 34%

YES, teach them . . . . . . . . . ..66%

It is in the comments made by
students that one finds the real sig-
niﬁcance of this study. While a
deﬁnite two-thirds majority believes
it is necessary that youth he told
what these “isms” are about if we
are to know what democracy really
means—this provision is often
expressed: “It is important that
only the facts be taught; we don’t
want any ‘isms’ being spread
through the class room. College is
primarily a place for instructors to
teach, not to preach.”

Streamlined Education
Government Investigates Plans
F or Brief Engineering Course

Under direction of the United
States Office of Education, the So-
ciety for the Promotion of Engi-
neering Education is conducting an
inquiry among the 135 engineering
schools of the nation to determine
the desirability and feasibility of
accelerating the training of engi-
neering students. The government
agency  suggested a 12 months a
year education program with grad-
uat’on in three years.

Dr. F. 1‘... Bishop, professor of
physics and secretary of the nation-
al society, has sent questionnaires
to all the engineering schools, but
explains that results of the inquiry
will not be released until next
month.

In addition to a full three-year
program instead of the present four
years, the plan includes various
means of tuition assistance.

WAA party for February fresh-

When the ﬁndings of the society
are complete, the Office of Educa-
tion will ask Congress for neces-
sary appropriations. The Ofﬁce of
Education is developing the plan at
the request of the Social Security
agency, which feels a greatly in-
creased supply of fully-trained en-
gineers is necessary for the nation-
al defense program.

Government and industry now
need between 40,000 and 50,000 en-
gineers a year, according to the so-
ciety. At present, the total gradu-
ation of all the engineering schools
in the United States amounts to
about 12,000 to 15,000 a year. By
lengthening the school terms and
thus combining four years into
three, engineering colleges could
graduate engineers more rapidly to
speed up the national program.

all the equipment has been in-

When asked to predict an open-
ing date for the new smoke ’n coke
spot, Mr. Klimchek replied thusly,
“Work on a cafeteria, restaurant, or
Tuck shop is a specialty. It is like
designing a woman’s hat. Every
job is different. Specialties take
time. Therefore, on this job, the
time is unpredictable.”

Mr. Klimchek reports, however,
that the work is progressing. After
waiting a month for the plaster to
dry, the painters have now begun
their work. The carpenters and
plumbers will follow in a short
time. The furniture, chromium
legs for the tables, and the formica
for the table tops are all on order.

The new eatery will be about
three times the size of the present
new Tuck shop. “It will be opened
some time this semester,” says
Klimchek cautiously. Luncheon
dates at this time are a bit prema-
ture.

If the University were to announce that all stu-
dent publications cease, the student body would be
quick to rise and protest. Student publications here
at Pitt, just as anywhere in America, are dependent on
the students themselves. They must edit, they read
and they support.

The success of student publications, financially,

directly depends upon the students. The money paid
b the student for his co ice is triﬂina‘ com ared to
P ‘U P
the cost of 1'unn1ng the Individual magazine or news-
paper. The ii.npor°iar1t source of revenue comes from
advertising, national and local.
