Dear Sirs:—
It has occurred to me several times

that perhaps you desire to_ keep track

of graduates -in the war theatre. so. I
will remark about myself. . . .

I got my degree in June, 1911 (M.
D.), and was at New Castle, Pennsyl-
vania for awhile-—went to Manila, P. 1.,
on. a. sugar plantation in 19:16, and when
the’'- British ‘Consul there asked .me. to

va‘c_co’mpany 9. ship.§.of Chinese to France,

1- ,jaceepte'dw<..(ALu‘gu‘st1,128; '-§1°9‘17.).'1 and «aim.-

Perhaps-‘you do not know thatthe
Philippines are exempt,‘ and as I had
poliomyelitis-and got a. drop foot‘ out
of it,.-I would not have been admitted
if an examination (physically) had been
given me. ‘ As I was so anxious to be
here I accepted.

I shall not seek to be transferred to"
an American Unit, as I would probably
be discharged as I -am not. Class .A
physically. I want you to know I am
doing ~my part and thoroughly enjoy my
associates.

Yesterday, we had a beautiful demon-
stration of im ediate surgical case of
complibated f actures by a. d'i.stln‘-
guished militarysurgeon of rank. His
apparatuses were remarkably ingeni-
ous, simple and_valua.bl~e. .

DEATH CALLS.
   SIMMENQI6

V\/"alter S. Simmen, ‘l6, of 234 44th
street, Pittsburgh, died last Thurs-
day, February 7, from heart trouble.
The funeral services were held Mon-
day at 2 o’.c'lock and were atten-dc-d
by many of his former associates at
Pitt. He was a n1e1nb.er- of .;the Delta
Sigma PiA(Phi Delta Theta) Fra-
ternity, and his deatlh is the first in
that brotherhood.’ M‘em'bers of the
-active chapter of the fraternity acted
as pallbearers. _

After graduating from the School
of Mines he went to work at Benton,
VVis., and while there, became so ill
that he had to return to Pittsburgh.
As an underg{ad\u‘at.e he was ‘a ‘mem-
ber of the Student Senate, of the Ad-
visory B-oard on Student Activities,
and was a member of othe football
squaldz. He was able to attend the
Pitt-State football game last Thanks-
g.iv.in;g Day, but his convditrion became
more serious from that time on.
DR. G. J. SMITH .

Dr. George J. Smith, who gradu-
ated in 1899 from the School -of Med-
ieine, -one of -the -best-known physi-
cians of Niles, 0.,’ was killed Febru-
ary 6, when his automobile was
struck by an Erie railroad .«train at
Niles. A -The‘ Youngstown “Vin-di-
-cator” ha-s the following account of
the Iacclidentt . i " ,

NILES, Feb. 6.—The North Main
street crossing of the Erie known as
the “death trap," claimed another vic-
tim last evening at 5:30, when Dr.
George J. Smith, one of the best known
and most highly esteemed physicians
and citizens of Niles, was struck by
train No. 620. and suffered injuries
which caused. deathwithin a half hour.
Dr. Smith had been makings-a call on
I-Ieajon avenue and was returning to
his residence on Park avenue, when the
train came in sight, and evidently he
failed to hear the warning, for he drove
directly on the track. .I-Iis, automobile
was struck squarely inthe middle and

demolished. ~’I_‘he. doctor was thrown to
one side. of. the‘-_tra.cl;, a.-ndg_wa’s: injured in

on the ‘streetiat the ‘time witnessed the
accident. I-Ioll.ow'ay’s‘ .“amb.ulan'ce» was
summoned and started for the hospital‘
‘with the doctor, who .was conscious at
the time. He inquiredvwhere they were
going, and when informed that they
were driving to the hospital, requested
that they turn and take him to his
home, which was ‘done. . » '

Dr. Smith had- resided in Niles the
last seventeen years and had a. wide ex-
perience as a. physician, who was al-
ways faithful in the discharge of his
duties. He was born in Cincinnati on
May 8, 1875,. the son of Mr. and .Mrs.
Henry Smith, who now reside in Birm-
ingham, Ala. He received his educa-
tion ln the north, graduating from the
high school in Pittsburgh, from the
University of’ Pittsburgh, and from the
West Penn Medical college. Later he
received the degree of A. M. from the
‘University of Duquesne. He ﬁrst took
up practice as the house surgeon in St.
Franpis hospital in Pittsburgh, and'on
leaving the hospital came directly to
Niles where he had practiced ever since.
He was a'member of St. Stephen's
church, a. most faithful worker and
supporter of the church, a. member of
‘the K. of C., the A. O. H. and the Niles
He took an‘ active in-
terest in the d'eve’bpm,ent of many. pro-
je(cts in Niles and was always interested
in its industrial welfare. On July 19,
1900, he was united in marriage to Miss
Katherine McLaughlin of Rochester,
Pa.., who survives with his aged parents.
The entire community .mourns today the
loss it has suffered. and hundreds of
friends thronged the house on Park ave-
nue last night and this morning, extend-
ing their sympathy to the family.

The funeral will be held on Friday
morning"at ‘St. St_ephen’s church, when
a. solemn high mass will be celebrated,
in which Rev. D. B. Crotty will be as-
sisted by Rev. Leo Schweirin of Can-
ton and other priests. The Trumbull
Medical association will attend the serv-
ices ina body. -_ . I - 1

. guards, _Garbish and Tressell, effec-
,_,,""ii.‘tively covered every attempt of the
p  "Pitti forwards and it_was -rarely that
 they could get away with an °-open
‘ ' -shot- ' , .

Pit—t came back in the second half
 and baskets by Penman, Levine and

i

Robinson, coupled with some fouls,
put Pitt ahead, 21-20. During this
time W. & J. relaxed a bit on their
guarding and seemed to care nothing

but the offense, piling up the score. .

With Pitt in the lead they tightened
up again and held Pitt, while‘ they
rolled in a few. W'it‘h. the close guard-
ing it was impossible for Pitt to get
near enough for a‘ good shot at the
basket and resorted to some long
ones. They were lucky in this ‘re-
spect and Penman and Levine caged
three from the middle of the floor.
One of _Penman’s shots from the side-
lines in the center of the ﬂoor went
in the basket without touchinglthe
rim. In the meantime Pitt’s guard-
ing had tightened up and it was im-
possible for W. & J. to get -cI'ose to
the‘ basketieither. ‘Carroll took “shot
after shot from back of -the'~fou1 circle
but was unable -to get one safe.

_These long shots. of Pitt took the
heart out of the Red and Black and
put pep into the Pitt ﬁve. They went
like a house aﬁre and there was no
stopping them. They continued till
they had a lead of seven points on
their opponents, 35-28. The game was
drawing to a close and the Red and
Black made one last desperate effort
to win, but they were short when the
timekeeper’s whistle blew.

No substitutions were made by
either team during -the game. Robin-
son started his ﬁrst game at center
in place, of Nicholas and he showed
up in great form. Though he was
outju-mped ‘most of the time he kept
