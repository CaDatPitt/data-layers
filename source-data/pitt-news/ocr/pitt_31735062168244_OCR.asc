The 5.4 CA saga.

G SAGA to Return -- 1 Student Contro

by BOB BONN g .

SAGA food service will be back
again next year. but changes are
in the air for the Universitys
board situation.

According to Housing Director
John Vrana, SAGA’s contract has

been renewed for another year, ‘

starting in September. Included
in the’ contract for the first time,
however, will be direct supervis-
ory control over,-SAGA by a stu-
dent-faculty committee.

The decision to retain SAGA
was made by a special board.
appointed by Vice-Chancellor
Bernard Kobosky. Five bids were
received. «

__l3lans Run Gainut

 

SAGA. and _the other companies
vying for the food service job.
Interstate L'nited. Professional
Food Management. SZABO. and
Automatic Retail Association.
were all thoroughly considered.

Of prime importance to the de-
cision were'three major areas:
financial (the amount the -f-ood

‘ service ‘agreed to pay back to the

University for space rental. and
equipment feesi. operational

':familiarity with facilities and.

relations with local unions). and
service (unlimited seconds. spec-
ial menus. eggs for breakfast
each morning. etc. i.

The committee felt that SAGA
madethe best _offer of all bidders,

and thus was awarded the con-
tract. Vrana emphasized, how-
ever, that the decision was not
simple for the student-faculty-
;administrative committee, since
‘each company went into great
detail in explaining what it could
provide over and above the Univ-
ersity’s basic requirements.

An especially important facet
of food service operation next
year. differing from the past.
will be actual student control

over ‘SAGA. A central Food Serv—» ,

ice Committee. chaired by Vrana.
will have separate divisions. com-
posed mainly of students. to
‘investigate V both boarding and
‘non-boarding operation.

The committees will be res-
ponsible for evaluation of food

Politicking in the Fall

*>

‘by BILL GORMLEY
News Editor

Students across the nation be-
came interested again in Amer-
ica’s political processes last
month. President Nixon's Cam-
bodia decision and the slaying of
four Kent State undergraduates
.sparked a movement on many
campuses to employ once more
the tactics of 1968.

Princeton University set the
pace as it provided for a two week
shutdown prior to November 10.
Election Day. In Pittsburgh.
Chatham College announced that
classes would be canceled during

‘the ten day period immediately
preceding elections.

Pitt has not yet taken a stand
on the matter, but a decision is
expected soon. i

13 Week Term

Because the fall term at the Univ-
ersity is a mere 13 weeks long.
Pitt is not likely to declare a pre-
election recess. as Princeton and
Chatham have done. without

stipulating that academic work

be made up. “The calendar is-

already abominably short."
Physics Professor John Town-
send noted. probably expressing
the sentiments of. the majority
of his colleagues. g
Privately. many faculty mem-
bers and administrators argue
that students who want. to parti-
cipate; in political campaigns
should be willing to make personal
s_a crifices. They add that students
have such options as receiving
"1" ilncompletei grades ,for
courses; obtaining credit for poli-
tical ‘work from —~ the Political
Science Department. or even‘ tak-
ing ‘the term 'off to canvass. if
sufficiently motivated.
Nevertheless. most appear
willing to go along with some
sort of arrangement whereby
/ students would be encouraged to
.get involved in politics this fall
and a sympathetic glance would

be extended to those who choose '

to do so. . .
,'gS'eve.ral suggestions are cur-
. . . . . . by Eh
. .;h__.

19, the Senate will reach a decis-

faculty will deliberate and come

All ; the proposals that have
been advanced have one thing in
common‘: they call for an inten-
sive series of speeches. seminars.
and programs designed to famil-

 ILS. Overpopulationz

 Considering the problems of air and
t._erj pollution. poverty. clogged highways-. _, .

hundreds of thousands of people from their de-
vastated towns and villages or forced them to
live in tunnels and caves.

Okinawa. Guam. the Phillipines. the sur-
rounding oceans have all served as sanctuaries
for the American war. . V

The invasion of Cambodia. in brazen defiance
of international law. is simply another step in
this escalation.

The United States in Cambodia finds itself
supporting a right-wing government that clearly
cannot gain popular support.

This is the substantive meaning of the Amer-
ican invasion. If we do not intervene. the gov-
ernment will no doubt be overthrown by forces
loyal to Siha nouk. ‘

As news reports make clear. many Cambodi-
an peasants are joining the left-wing Cambodian
guerrillas. ‘

In the words of the outstanding correspondent
of Le Monde, J. C. Pomonti. “The conditions for
an active rebellion have been fulfilled one by
one." -

AN ELITE

Therefore the l'nited ‘States is forced to adopt‘
the same methods it has used. in Vietnam and
Laos when faced by popular forces that canhot
be controlled by the tiny elite that the L'.S. in-
evitably backs: invasion and occupation. or in-
tensive and destructive bombardment.

In Cambodia. as in Laos and Vietnam. we
will no doubt discover. soon enought. that this
bombardment is aimed at civilian targets." that
is. at the popular base for the guerillas.

Meanwhilethe U.S. government willlcontinue
to pretend. as in Laos and South Vietnam. that it
is fighting only North Vietnamese. ‘

There is little doubt that the Cambodian popu-
lation remains loyal to Sihanouk. An Indochina
front including Sihanouk. the NLP‘. the Pathet
Lao. an the North Vietnamese is apparently be-
ing trained to fight. in a unified fashion. against
the right-wing government we have installed and
backed. and against the American expeditionary
force with its vast technological‘resources of
destruction. -

The United States can conft-bat these popular
forces only by endless and undiminshedlwar
fought in the most brutal fashion. The recent
events in Cambodia. including the American in-
vasion. demonstrate. once more. these obvious.
lacts. ‘ -

and rides-‘to concerts in other cities as well as
demonstrations."

The only drawback to the venture. they find.
is that people don‘t seem willing to support them.

"We figured that things would be rough in the
summer." said Anderson. "but we're really los-
ing what we've put into it. And we don't have any
money ourselves."

“But if we can survive the summer, we’ll
make it,_” he added optimistically.

The Free Peoples‘ Store is located adjacent
to Environment II. although Anderson joked that
the store "has no contact with it. socially. poli-
tically or otherwise. 

Besides records. which can be purchased
there for $2 less than anywhere else. the store is
selling posters. head trappings and in the fu-
ture. arts and crafts.‘ I . .

_ The Art Institute is planning to exhibit some.
of its works there, according to the former Pitt
News staff member. . '

"Any artist can do it." he continued. "And we
only ask for l5 per cent commission for the main-
tenance of the store. Every other place requires
35-50 per cent of the ‘selling price. but we think
that the artist should make the money."

It's a life style kind of thing. he concluded.
‘It's something we believe in. " 

Fact 0r Fiction?

the United States has more people than it can

adequately maintain.

But even if we were not overpopulated at
home. we could not stand detached from the rest
of the world. We are completely dependent on im-
ports l'or our affluence.

We use roughly half of all the raw materials
produced on the face of the earth every year.

“And I Closed
My Record Book”

by DON MARBURY
Editor

There is a comic book character called “The Watcher."
Oh he's not one of those super beings with all sorts of super-
ior powers, in fact he‘s not even a being. "The Watcher is an
ethereal god-like personage, whose only job is to look down on
our world and recordthe events in our lives. He is not per-
mitted to interfere in the life of anyone, no matter how badly
things are going for him. He must simply watch and record
the things that happen.

Well one night I dreamed I was “The Watcher." And I
was watching the day break on the world which I had written
about for ages and had grown to love. My thoughts drifted

‘back into past centuries—on.the bad and often catastrophic

scenes I had to record. And I smiled because I knew that
earth had always bounced back—that somehow these humans
had found solutions, no matter how conditional and momen-
tary they were‘, to the problems that plagued them. V _

But on this‘ day Inoticedthat I couldn’t see my earth well. ‘
I looked at the sun next tome. but it was out full and shining.

I then_saw that there was a thick black mass hovering above a

the world, and came to the horrifying-recognition thatthis
filth, that now surrounded it, had once been it’s atmosphere.’

‘I noticed that the air was still constantly being supplied with

dirt deposits, but I didn‘t get alarmed, for I could still see and
record the earth, and I knew thatit would come up with a
solution. -‘-

And I scanned over America, one of my favorite spots, so
beautiful to look at; a feat for my sometimes tired eyes.’ But
the beauty was gone, and in its place was refuse, mountains

‘of discarded items, sewers overflowing with garbage. grass-
‘es and fields battling tissues, dixie cups and beer cans, in

stead of weeds. I grimaced but I knew that this country would
come up with something to alleviate the problem.

I started looking at the peop1_e——the magnificant. Ameri-
can people. And I saw an American, Vietnamese and Chinese
soldier all grab their stomachs at the same time and topple to
blood-smeared battlegrounds; dead of bullet wounds. And it
bothered me that they had not seen the senselessness of this
long ago. But my optimism for them still prevailed.

I scanned the colleges (I loved to look at the youth of the
country getting knowledge) but I saw them too in battle,

’ many with their fathersfwho were dressed in police and mili-

tary uniforms. And they were killing each other. I could see
the hate in their eyes, just as I had seen it in the eyes of the
dead American soldiers ‘and their allies and enemies, I
I‘ started to reach out a hand to help them, to showthem
the way, but realizing I could not, ‘I consoled myself with “no
they’ll straighten things out.” _ . .
Turning my eyes to America’s-black ghettos, a short un-

anticipated gasp was emitted from my throat. ‘I had not look-'

ed at this part of my earth for a long time, and the last time I
did, it had depressed me very much. But I had amired the
people and their strength under the conditions in which they
lived, the frustrations that they went.-through, and had just as-

sumed that the next time I recorded them, their problems ,

would be solved. But I look at them, and saw Iwas wrong.
The homes they lived in were still the same. ,They still were
hungry, jobless, looked on with disdain by the rest of Ameri-
ca, exploited, and unnoticed. I‘ shuddered as I witnessed
rats and vermin attacking their children. And yes they too

'had taken up arms. .

Ineeded a better scene, so turning my eyes away qyickly,
just knowing I would find some pleasant sights, I cam upon an
old man sitting in front of his window in a rocking chair look-
ing at the many people walking by. I wanted to yell as he put a
pistol tohis head, but I had no power to stop "him. And I won-
dered why America was not taking care of its older people. _

And I looked to the streams and rivers and oceans and
saw that the abundant life in them was dying from grease and

chemical slickened water. The wildlife was extinct. Of the in-.
~sects, even the hated mosquito was gone from the air. P

All about me in Americawas death, hatred, hunger, dis-
ease, filth, and violence. And the few I saw that seemed un-
touched by all these things sat back in what seemed to be huge

_ palaces, smoking expensive cigars, or stuffing their already

obese bodies with food.

I could not bear my favorite country anymore. I turned
to the other lands. the other peoples and countries of my
earth. But I found the situations were the same as in Ameri-
ca. And I was shaking with almost uncontrollable remorse,
and disallusionment, when I heard what seemed to be an ex-
plosion. only louder and more intensified than a combination

of sounds from all the earths wars I had recorded, and I had to .

turn my eyes__ away for a blinding fiery light had encompass-

ed it.

I looked back at my earth.’ And there was nothing. I\turn-
ed back and closed myrecord book. i

The Pitt News:

The May 19th issue of The Pitt
News carried an article entitled
LRDC Aims to Stymie Defense.

The article. written by Lee Ter-
kel. reported that "The center
collectively expressed its dis-
approval of President Nixonlx
decision to move troops into Cam-
bodia and of the killings at Kent
State. Jackson State and Augusta
Ga."

‘gal wish to take exception to the

use of the word collectively.
Mr. Terkel reported that about 30
people. most of them-LRDC re-

searchers. participated in the ses-

SIOIT.

LRDC employes between 190 to
200 people. which means that
only one-sixth or less of the total
LRDC personnel attended the ses-
sion. ’

How then. I ask. does,.Vlr. Ter-
kel rationalize that the center
collectively expressed its disap-
proval when in truth only a small '
minority of LRDC personnel chose '
to express disapproval‘? .

.i .":BRYANSALER, wh has won the triple jump at four different meets this

year, became the first athlete in the East to jump over 50 feet in the jump’
in the IC4A’s at Penn. Salter, howerever, fouled and was disqualified.

by VINCE Di NARDO

The Pitt track squad has had
more to cope with this outdoor
season than the numerous injuries
which it has suffered. Along with
gthe physical drawbacks. the
-1.-lracksters have had some prob-
Lilems with the officials.

Bryant Salter. who has starred

' for Pitt in both the triple jump and

the high jump all season. had his
best performance this year wiped
out by an official's call at the IC4A
Eastern championships at Penn
Saturday. His jum. 52 ft.. one
inch. marked the first time that
anyone in the East had ever clear-
ed 50 feet. However. Salter was
disqualified for fouling. He was
ruled a quarter-inch over the al-
loted line at thetake-off point.

"I was quite disappointed." said
Salter. "it was a judgment call

‘ and the official called it as he saw

it."

Salter was pleased by the jump,
regardless. “Nowyl know that I
can do it. Even though it didn’t
count, I know I can do it.”

 lﬂedich, Solonickne Named To

Tri-State All-Stars First Team;

Five Panther baseball players
,have been selected to play in the
second annual Tri-State Baseball
Coaches Association All-Star

, game at Forbes Field June 14.

The Associations's commision—
er. Owen Daugherty of Indiana.
made the announcement over the

weekend. as‘the group of district

coaches completed plans for their
game.

George Medich. the Panthers
pace moundsman. and Bob Solon-

: . ickne. right-fielder and leading

hitter. led the Panthers in the bal-
loting. Medich was named as the
league's outstanding right—handed
_ pitcher. and Solonickne was chos-
‘en as the district's top rightfield-
er for the second consecutive year.

Three other Pitt players were
named to the North squad in the
All-Star encounter, along with
Medich and Solonickne.

Panther captain and second
baseman Cliff Brown_ was select-
ed in his best of three seasons un-
der Pitt coach Bobby Lewis. It

w_as his first selection to the squad.

L The other Panthers named to
the North team were outfielder
._Terry Stokes and shortstop Ron

' — 'O‘Godnik.

Stokes will also be making his
first appearance in the game af-
ter starting in centerfield for the
Panthers as, a freshman, filling a
big whole in the line-up when Joe
McCain, a selection to the All-
Star game in centerfield last sea-
son, broke his leg and missed this
spring’s action.

The All-Star game; which was
originally scheduled for June 15
at Three Rivers Stadium before
construction difficulties at the
North Side park. will be played un-
der the same format as last spring
with at least one player from each
of the schools in the association. .

The North squad will be com-
prised of players from Gannon,

"Maybe I can do it the next
time.” continued the discouraged
athlete.

The decision was not just dis-
appointing to Salter. Pitt ended in
a tie for sixth place in the meet. A
Salter victory would have added
four points to the Pitt total. which
would have given them a total of
17 points and a fourth place fin-
ish. one point from third place.

The thinclads suffered an ear-
lier disqualification at the Big
Four meet at West Virgina, which
also cost Pitt a victory.

_ The Salter disqualification cou-
;:pled with the fact that Jerry Rich-
Eey was not healthy for the meet
fprobably denited Pitt the chance
3,10 challenge Villanova. who has
-{been the winner in ten of the last
??14 years. Richey. with an ankle in-
jury. didn‘t even place for the
tracksters.

In spite of these two negative
aspects. the Bannermen had some
good performances. Dan Kouvolo
set anew meet record in the jav-
elin throw with a_ hurl of 251 ft..
five inces. Kouvolo‘s throw broke

' the old record of 149 ft.

Kouvolo along with Salter has
been a consistent performer for
Jim Banner this spring.

Greg Rodgers. who has been
hampered by injuries. was back in
form and finished fourth in the
steeplechase. Steve Hein also
3__scored for Pitt as he placed fifth
;in thp discus. Dave Cheseborough
gbroke Jerry Richey's old record
«in the six mile‘ run with a time of
19:21.5 and finished sixth. Rich-
ey‘s old record was 29:23.

Smittie Brown qualified for the
finals in the 440 yard run and 
Pitt mile relayteam finished fifth’.

Carlos Riesen was replaced by
Elliot Drysdale in the mile relay
team when he pulled a ‘muscle
while running in the intermediate
hurdles. Risen was leading in the
event when the injury occurred,
but failed to score. This probably
had an effect on the mile relay‘
team’s performance in the trials;
they finished one-tenth of a second
behind winner Villanova.

Salter‘s “next time“ will come
June 19 as the thinclads travel to
Drake for the national champion-
ships. The IC4A's were the East-
tern championships. -

by MARTY HELLMAN

Pitt sports fans may be in store for a full day of action on two Sat-
urdays this fall. Because of the new .AstroTurf that will be carpeting
Pitt Stadium_ this year, the Athletic Department is considering sched-
uling a "football" doubleheader on Oct. 3 and Oct. 17. .

The first game of the twinbill would be a soccergame, which mgsﬁtf

countries classify as football. The Pitt hooters are scheduled to  H

Carnegie-Mellon on Oct. 3. the day of a Panther football game against

-Kent State. On Homecoming Day.

overlap. Ath-.

letic’ Director
Casmir Myslin- :
sk-i wants to take
advantage of the?
situation.

   
 

The problems that Myslinski
refers to can be summarized by
considering the time element in-

, volved in the situation. “First of

‘all." the AD commented. "we

- have to consider whether the peo-
ple want to sit for that long a per-
iod of time. P i

"Also. we have to think in terms

of clearing thefield for the 'foot- ‘
7 ._ball_game.". - ' P ’

e ‘Soccer Coach Leo Bemis would
like to see the proposal-come ,to
fruition. “We’d“like to get;__’?;é‘

-"A5"0f Tight “OW: We are going _game beforeas ‘many people as

to try to play both the soccer
game and the football game at the
Stadium those days,” he said.
“However, if we can’t work a few
things out, the soccer games will
have ‘to beeither played at an-

V, other field or at another time.-”

possible,” he remarked. “In past
years we have been unable to play
at a field wherestudents and in-
terested people could attend.”

.Although all other soccer games
will ’be.played at the Stadium» this i
year, Bemis hopes that these two

5“games can also be arranged for ‘

the Stadium.

‘'1' hope -that by playing.— the.
game at a~time when many people»
will be around or coming to the
Stadium." he said.‘ “we may be.
able to interest mor_e people into
coming to other soccer games‘
during the year.” I ’

If timing can beiarranged by the
Athletic Department, the only
other obstacles to‘ the doublehead-
er will be the lining of the_field'and
the positioning of the goals.

"These problems can be work-
ed out easily." said Bemis. “Al-
ready at the University of Penn-
sylvania. the football and soccer

lines are permanently placed on

the artificial turf and they haven‘t
had any problems there.” i

Golf Team

Ends Even
For Spring

The golf team ended its 1970
season last Thursday in a dis-
appointing 5-2 defeat to Penn
State at the Pitt squads home
course. the Shannopin Country
Club.

The loss dropped the record to
.')'-3-1. as the golfers shot well.
but not as good as the tough Penn
State team. Everyone of their
losses this season have come on

 playing‘ days. surprisingly.

"We even had a guy to shoot
over 78." Peery said after the
finale. "And we got beat. 5-2.
'l‘hat’s some golf. “

Nick Raash led Penn State to
the triumph with a 70.

The Pitt golfers were bunched
as they have been often in their
first .500 season in quite awhile.

Charles Patrick and Tim Crist
were low scorers for Peery's
team. shooting 74s. John Jubala

and Rick Plonkafollowed with 75 .

" ,g7b'. respectively. Mike Jones
;‘sf'ot, a 77. and Hay George and
Mike McGuire fired the 78's.

Peery noted that despite the
final loss his team could have
finished well-over the .500 mark
this spring.

“It's the first time in several
years we've reached .500. butwe
would have probably been bet-
ter than .500 if it weren’t for the
rain."' he said. “We had so many
called off." »

 of the golfers’ matches
were ,cancelled this spring be-
cause of rain.

Netters Take Drubbing
At University Park

by MIKE MILLER

The Pitt tennis team bowed
to a powerful Penn State squad.
Saturday. taking a 9-0 drubbing
at L7niversity Park.

.\'one of the matches were hot-
ly contested. Tom’ Stromp was the
last man off

Mike Dzadow- '
ski and Doug .\lc
liee suffered
similar fates.

Coach
Webster stat-
ed, however,
that the three of .
them turned in
the best perform-
ances of the day. "

Fran

The courts at ~ » -
State were of a sand composition
and much softer than the team is
used to.

Webster stated that. though this
was a minor handicap. the re-
sults would have been the same on
any type of play'ing surface.

“They are the best team we’ve
played all year,” stated the coach.
“They have a fine team made up
of all freshmen and sophomores.
They are going to be our toughest
opponents for two or three years.”

However Webster has hopes
for the future which. if fulfilled.
will enhance his ability to deal with
such rugged competition.

He plans a vast recruiting cam-
paign to attract some of the areas
talent.

Though he is handicapped by

lack of funds and facilities he 7

hopes to interest prospective
players in Pitt’s academic pro-
gram.

If he can attract some good
players in this way and can ob-
tain decent facilities he will have
an attractive program to offer
to prospective players.

 

 

 

The improved facilities will
include courts with a better drain-
age systems and wind breaks to
eliminate some of the weather
factors.

Some type of indoor practice
facilities would enable the play-
ers to deep their game in shape
during the winter months.

When the team is able to com-
pete with tougher schools an ear-
ly season Southern tour might be
feasable.

Webster‘ says that he knows that
the tennis team will never get as
much attention from the Athletic
Department in the form of scholar-

ships and equipment that the
basketball. football and track
teams receive.

However. given a. fighting

chance. he feels that his team has
a future.
