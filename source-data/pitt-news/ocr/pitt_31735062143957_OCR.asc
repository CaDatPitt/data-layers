graduate pictures will be an-
nounced later. Gimbel’s photo stu-
dio will stay open tomorrow
‘evening from 7:15 to 9 o’lock for
the convenience of the students.

“Every senior will want a 1945
Owl as a lasting remembrance of
his college days,” said LaRue
Moss, editor. “Get your yearbook
either from Owl salesmen, identi-
ﬁed by an Owl dogtag, or in the
Owl office.”

Gimbel’s has asked that all ap-
pointments be made for sittings

English Classes

Use Records

If you think you hear Orson
Welles talking in the next class-
room, you may be right, for the
department of English bought a
recording machine and a number
of records to use in the literature
courses.

Mr. Welles of the Mercury The-
atre Group, reads the Shakes-
pearean plays Macbeth and Othel-
lo; and John Gielgud, a well-
known ‘English actor, interprets
a complete record anthology of
assorted English and American
poems. The purpose of using rec-
ords, according to Maurice Weil,
assistant professor of English, is
that the stu-dents get the value of
professional reading.

Besides the professional actors,
Carl Sandburg, Robert Frost, and
Gertrude Stein read their own
works.

Leav_ing the poetry, the depart-
ment has volumes of Old English
and'Early American ballads sung
by John Jacob Niles, and the Gil-
bert and Sullivan operetta, Pt-
rates of Penzance, which is done
by the D’Oyley Carte Opera Com-
pany of London. This operetta
along with Iolanthe is given an-
nually in the Victorian Literature
clas-sesilby Mr. Weil.

There will be a meeting of
all those interested in the re-
vival of a Pitt monthly maga-
zine on Thursday, November 8,
in 132 CL at 3:00 o’clock. Po-
tential staﬁ members, please at-
tend.

Pitt Medical Unit
Awarded Plaque

A meritorious service unit
plaque has been awarded‘.-the Uni-
versity’s General Hospital 27 in
Hollandia, Dutch New Guinea. The
award was made by Commanding
General Edmond H. Leavey for the
year ending July 24. _ '

The unit, which was "organized
in 1941, is composed of Pitt med-
ical_and dental faculty and nurses
from Base Hospital 27. The group
went overseas in 1943,;and has
made a number of achievements
which were cited by Gen. Leavey.
The unit established the ﬁrst blood
bank in the theater “which was
used as a model for subsequent
banks and won-high praise from
numerous sources.” It provided
all its own equipment for-its med-
ical and surgical patients.

ager, Bernard Puett, the Recon-

most novel dances Pitt has had
for some time. “The committee
heads and members have worked
hard to make the evening a big
success,” he said. “We have tried
to accentuate the unusual in dec-
orations, and wewould like to
see the student body turn out and
really support this ﬁrst evening

This year with World War II over and veterans and former
students returning to Pitt, We, the student body should be get-
ting back :to normalcy. It is granted that in the past. three years

we were deprived of some of our old campus activities--lack
of available space and decrease in enrollment being the princi-
pal reasons for such departure from the usual extra—cu-rricular
schedule. But now that the problem of space facilities is relieved
and a deﬁnite increa.se in enrollment is noted, Student Congress
has again planned a student program, and all we are asked of
is to COOPERATE.

For illustration let us review the student assembly that
took place last Thursday in the Stephen Foster Memorial.
Looking out over the audience there were more empty red seats
than students. The meager attendance was scattered over the

I ﬁrst floor; the balcony was empty. ‘

In contrast, let us return to a scene in the Cathedral where
general confusion reigns over the Tuck Shop. There, not a blue
seat is vacant. The continual droning and humming of conver-
sation rises above the smoke haze.

 These two pictures certainly do not infer that the Pitt
 v student is willing to support his school ’s activities.

Student Congress does its best to present the best speakers
possible for these assemblies. The orchestra takes time to prac-
tice for the musical part of the program. The guest speakers
give their time for the students. CAN WE THE STUDENT

A BODY NOT GIVE ONE HOUR OF OUR TIME IN RETURN
. TO‘ SIT AND LISTEN TO SOMETHING THAT WILLPROVE
I _AN ‘ENJOYMENT AS WELL AS AN EDUCATION‘! '
For the Notre Dame pep rally the student body turned out
in full strength. There was plenty of enthusiasm apparent in
the ‘noisy cheering. The Memorial was overcrowded. 'Why can’t
you same men and women support these student assemblies?
Two common excuses heard over the campus were: (1)
fourth hour classes were not excused, and (2) that no one knew
,1, A anything about the assembly. In answer to the ﬁrst, fourth hour

  classes were not dismissed for the pep rally but the Pitt student
b_ody was well represented regardless. Secondly, the Pitt News
carried a lead story with all the details in an issue on the day
the assembly took place, and an editorial was also written in
regard to the purpose of such a gathering.

To our University we owe a great deal of loyalty. To our
student government we owe the same loyalty. If in the future
Pitt men and women want more assemblies, plays, dances, and
other campus activities, they are going to have to do a better
job of supporting them. In such case support and cooperation
are almost synonymous. Thus, COOPERATE with Student Con-
», ress, and respect their efforts to give the student body a
 . beneﬁcial activity program.» I

(A notice appears on the ﬁrst page of this issue concerning a
meeting for men and women‘ interested in the revival of a Pitt
monthly magazine.)

Basically, what is the capacity of student literary talent
and judgement at this University? What proﬁciencies in writ-
ing have‘ we here? Sincethere is no campus publication that
engendersthe desire in a student to write creatively from a per-
sonal standpoint, through what outlet may the would-be ﬁction
writer present his embryonic work? _

_’ ‘ Fused with the wish of seeing Pitt achieve a postwar activi-
ties status, these questions are the factors that have led to the
attempt of organizing for a monthly student magazine. The
, men and women involved in the primary organization have suc-

ceeded in doing some preliminary ground work. Major student

‘ action of the literary minded is yet to be determined.

 is neither the ‘intention nor. the desire of the few who
haveinstigated and developed plans thus far for a monthly pub-
lication, to ask University support «for an activity unsupported
by a recognizable amount of students. The situation would not
 be feasible to any degree.
 a_Therefore, is-it not apparent that the power behind this
iprogect lies in the hands of many‘! If there is sufﬁcient, appli-

Vet GI Zette

By 33284396

TPA’s-take a big long bow.
Your open house for vets last Fri-
day was great. Hope the idea
spreads to the other sororities.
About 200 vets attended and made
good use of the refreshments and
entertainment provided. Seen at
one time or another were such
campus luminaries as Owney Mc-
Manus, who had the little TPA’s
mystiﬁed with his ability to make
doughnuts and cider disappear;

the Gigolotti brothers who didn’t _

let their long Army time hinder
their knack of enjoying them-
selves; beating the drum, for the
Soph Hop was ‘Bernie Puett; Bar-
ket Haddad selling the Vets Assoc.;
and, Jack Bailey, Bill Zeffiro and
Jack Ellis just plain having a good
time. All departing vets were
awarded Good Conduct Medals as

as leave was taken. Swell done,
TPAs!! ‘

Well, men’s fraternity rushing is
all over, isn’t it? Guess they

didn’t want me, I wasn’t rushed, I
was brushed. A lot of good boys
were garnered by the frats and
you’ll be hearing from them. Ex-
GI guys going fraternity include
Jim Maclntyre, Phi Delt; Dave
Morgan, Pi KA; Ted Huminsky,
Delt; Herbert Tauberg and Tom

Dental School Elects
New Class Officers

Results of the class elections of
the Dental school, which took
place Monday, October 22, have
just been released and are as fol-
lows:

Senior class: Howard Schiffer, presi-
dent; Robert Barr, vice-president; Ger-
aldine Fay, secretary; Ben Alpert. treas-
urer; Harold Dexter, and Murray
Schwartz. class representatives to Dental
Student Council.

Junior class: William Jordan, presi-
dent; Abraham Rothman, vice-president;
Lena Giannini, secretary-treasurer; Nath-
an Apple and Dennis Brault, class rep-
resentatives to Dental Student Council.

Freshman class: Alfred Scuillo, presi-
dent; Ray Richard, vice-president; Doris
Stewart, secretary-treasurer; Anthony
Perrone and Saul Greenwald, class repre-
sentatives to Dental Student Council.

The sophomore class of the
Dental school organized and held
class elections on Monday, Octo-
ber 29. The elected ofﬁcers are:

Abraham Fischer, president; Leonard
Fox, vice-president; Nancy LeFevre, sec-
retary-treasurer; and Joseph Haller, class
representative to Dental Student Council.

and if such talented persons would submit their writings con-
sistently, .‘the need of a monthly magazine would be obvious.
Adequate ﬁnances would support the need. However, unless
these three conditions prevail, it is not our prerogative to ask

for the magazine.

 

Had the great pleasure of lis-
tening tlo Bishop Pardue speak last
Thursday. Some of you vets who
have a free fourth hour should
take advantage of the speakers
regularly -provided: by’ the Uni-
versity. Next is Dr. T. Z. Koo, in-
ternational citizen, who will speak
December 7. No fooling, they don’t
try to sell you a thing and it sure
beats the ‘Tuck "Shop chatter.

Seeing that Penn State, Colorado
U., and other universities are at-
tempting to provide housing for
married G.I.’s made us wonder
about the situation nere at Pitt.
Well, the dean’s oiﬁ-ce h-as been
thinking about it too, but the
drawback thus far h-as been the
lack of available land space. A
census last semester revealed that
25% of the vets at school are
married. There are no ﬁgures on
the present enrollment but in-
dications are that the institution of
matrimony has quite a few’ in-
mates.

Letter To Editor

To the Editor:

Perhaps Messrs. Maclntyre,
Kerins, and Weston are really
anxious to build a substantial
United Nations government. Per-
haps they are really interested» in
maintaining world peace, but their
comments make me doubt that.

All three of them have done
their part in widening the rift
which is spreading between us
and our allies. The grounds upon
which they base their animosity
may be valid, but is this the time
for the airing of these animosi-
ties?

The time and place to begin
the purposeful discussion of in-
ternational policy is in a stable,
strong United Nations organiza-
tion. "

All I ask is how are we going to
get that organization without sub-
merging our controversies until
we have a civilized peaceable
method for settling them?

It is presumed that when a Uni-
versity provides one of its student
activities with ﬁnancial support,
the University will also back that
organization by providing a place
in which to work. This, however,
seems to be more philosophical
conjecture when applied to the
treatment by the University of
Pittsburgh of one of its largest
and ‘most active organizations,
PITT PLAYERS.

In peace times. the players. pro-
duced an average of three plays
a year. In this postwar year of
1945-46, there were plans for two
productions. The membership of
players totals one hundred stu-
dents; its audience should total a
minimum of two thousand during
the year, and yet this organization
must remain inactive because the
administration has not seen fit to
provide a technical workshop
which is both satisfactory and
adequate.

The administration “sympa-
thizes with the Players”, but
claims that the possibility of pro-
viding adequate and satisfactory
facilities is not in their immediate
consideration. The Players do not
want sympathy; they want a

To be sure, there is one place
available which is an area in the
University Printing office on the
top of the hill beyond the Tree’s
Gym. This place, however, will
not be available until Monday,
November 12—which would lim-
it the production time to two
weeks. It would be adequate but
not satisfactory, because it would
necessitate the administration’s
appointing a technical director to
work with the students. (This was
always‘ included» in the peace-time
program), and. the Players would
have to pay out of their meager
budget the money to transport
scenery in University trucks to
and from the proposed workship.

Yet, the Pitt Players have
had) a workship in the spring of
1945. Perhaps the past tense is
more suitable, for Players had a
workshop until the administration
appropriated it to house materials
from the Schenley Mansion ball-

room. Packing cases full of crys-
tal prisms and old panelling now
occupy the space formerly used
by the Players. It is estimated that
it would take at least $1000» to
move the ball room material else-
where, and even that action
would require precious production
time.

The production of “The Playboy
of the Western World”, formerly
scheduled for December 1, is'at a
standstill. The director, the ac-
tors, the technical and business
staffs can do nothing until work-
ing space is assured. For these rea-
sons the executive committee of
the Pitt Players has called a mass
meeting of all people interested in
Players at 3:30 o’clock today in
room 1312 CL. If you, the Univer-
sity students, want Players to con-
tinue on campus, come to the
meeting. , Egg

Effective postwar functioning in campus and community life and

Brieﬂy, the principles upone
which the interfraternity confer-
ence is basing its postwar plans are
these:

“l. The goal of the college fra-
ternity, in harmony with the goal
of the college, is to provide train-
ing and discipline. of the individual
who, in seeking an education, de-
sires to make of himself a useful
member of society, possessing
knowledge, trained skill, and ca-
pacity for accomplishment.

“2. The college fraternity must
regard itself as an integral part of
the institution in‘ which it is sit-
uated. It not only must be amen-
able to the rules and regulations
of the college institution, but also
share in all the college responsi-
bilities of the undergraduates.

“3. The college fraternity is also
a business organization. Success-
ful management requires sound
ﬁnancial practices and good house-
keeping methods.

“4. The college fraternity stands
for excellence in scholarship. It

MORE TRANSCONTINENTAL
TELEPHONE CIRCUITS

With wire scarce and wartime calls increasing,
telephone engineers made existing pairs of long
distance wires carry nearly four times as many
calls as before. This was done through installa-
tion of additional carrier equipment, requiring
closer spacing of the wires on the line and trans-
positions at shorter intervals.

Three pairs on the Southern Transcontinental
Route were rearranged, and in a 430—mile section
this had to be done while keeping the urgently

study by the fraternity member,
not only in order that the require-
ments of the college be met, but
also that achievement above the
average level may be maintained.

-,“5. The college fraternity ac-
cepts its role in the individual’s
moral and spiritual development.

“6: The college fraternity recog-
nizes that culture goes hand in

fore, seeks to broaden the frater-
nity member’s growth by encour-
aging the acquisition of knowl-
edge and training in cultural sub-
jeets.

“7. The college fraternity is the
center of the individual mem er’s
social life. It seeks to develop the
social graces, the art of good liv-
ing, the" development of courtesy
and kindness.

Now that Halloween is over and
all the fences have been put back
and the soap washed off the win-
dows, the boys in Fraternity Row
can settle back to normal again.

The Sigma Chi’s have gotten
three new pledges, Glenn Burg-
german, Dave Ahwesh, and Ronald
Confer. After the Ohio State game
Saturday some of the boys are
going to have a hay ride with ten
“lucky” girls from Ohio.

The Phi Gams have elected Bob
Jones, an ex G.I., as President.
Bob Was a Fiji at Pitt before en-
tering the service. A celebration
is going to take place in honor of
their twenty-eight new pledges
at Jones’s farm next week.

Speaking of pledge celebrations,
the Phi Eps had a stag in honor of
their pledges last Friday at. their
apartment.

The Delts had a dessert dance
with the Thetas at the Delt house
on Wednesday. On Saturday they
had a hot bowling party at the

The Pi Lams. re-elected Sam Far-
her as their ‘president. They‘ are
going to have a hay ride on the
Saturday of the Ohio State game

night. It seems they had a dance
at theirho-use.

The SAE’s attended a dance at

A house dance at the Phi Delts

Having survived Halloween (without our false-faces) and Sadie
Hawkins Day (polish your runnin’ shoes, girls, for next year and try
again!) we stagger in with the latest in what gives with the social
wolves and wolverines roaming around through Pitt.‘

The thought of the week: If some of you cats just ain’t on the
beam, we know what’s wrong, you’ve been cookin’ with cream. If
you want a beat that’s rugged and hard. Just fry me cookie! in a
can of Lard.

Now off to Press!!! ‘

Halloween Department:

For the occasion Mary Lou McFall had a party at her home.
Prominent couples were Fijis Kit Carson and Ted Hall with Kappas
Bunny Crawford and Judy Richmond respectively. '

The attraction that the three Kappas had at the SAE Halloween
presented a season skit in which the WOLF depicted the Zeta dates
and the SLICK CHICK, the MISS ZTA.

We betcha’ that “Lennie” at the YE GOLD BAR has the writers’
cramp from signing his John Henry on eggs from the Phi Mu
scavenger hunt.

Came Home Department:

That smile on Betsy Briant’s face is for her pop, a Lt. Colonel
who came home for good this week.

Jug Crock is wailing around in a swoon because her hunk of man
is home for 45 wooo—onderfu1 days.

Romance Department:

(This is the thing that in Spring your thoughts turn to).

Phi Kap prexy, Bob Battiste and his Squirrel Hill squirrel Ruth
Rank, are at the bubbling pointl!

Bill Raines and Abbie Westerman, a steady twosome were seen
stuck in Schenley Park for 1% hours. What’s matter Bill, couldn’t
you get the car started?

Pinning Department:

Long over—due announcements are the pinning of Dodie Hurrell
to Dan Natali, a Phi Rho in Med School. And next on the bandwagon
is the pinning of Mary Carolyn Daum to Jim Ludwig now with Uncle
Sammie. '

Another Pittite who took the ﬁnal step was Betty Fink. She was
married on October 5th. Another, Marietta Kennedy, is planning the
ﬁnal step on November 22nd.

Travel Department:

Three SAE’s; Frank Essick, Barket Haddad, Chris Luccy and their
dates ﬂew up Saturday to the OHIO STATE-NORTHWESTERN game.

To Nicholas Kalmer
-charge of the organization of the
Army Cafeteria before the coming
of the men in February, 1943, was
a man-sized job, and serving 2,500
meals three times a day was no
bed of roses. But on August 2-0»,
1944, this tall, dark-hair-ed man
left his “man-siz-ed” job for one
that was destined to demand much
more of him.

In October, 1944, after (being
named Director of Foreign Op-
erations for Greek War Relief,
he left the states and arrived in
Greece on ‘November 1. The duty
of the organization he representes
is to assist in the relief and re-
habilitation of Greece. Upon ar-
rival there Mr. Kalmer was ap-

By the way of the choo-choo, three DZ’s saw the Notre Dame-
Navy game in Cleveland. Was the attraction the game, ‘or the boys
in blue? »

Goings On In The Blue:

There was merry-making in the TPA booth as Marion Donahue
celebrated her .?th birthday.

. Flash! that Tennessee “Streak” Sig Max “Squeaky” Weethe is
proof alone that good things come in smallvpackages as he roams the
Blue.

them. Seven out of every hurnzdred

were enlisting at the Mfllitary

down because their x-Rays ﬂ1ow—

The Greek War Relief ha$ :four
jobs, Mr. Kalmer points outt, the
ﬁrst of which is to feed one mil-

second undertaking is to takeeacare
of the war veterans, espaxiially
those who have lost limbs-, asmd to
educate and reorient them ti) ci-
vilian life. The third job is to
look after war orphans to place
them in homes of relatives, our in
institutions. The fourth job iis to
clothe the people. The Greekm are
destitute. A million pairs of silhoes
were shipped from the Ulnited
States and distributed among the
people, and even now a halﬁ1mil-
lion are barefoot.

Mr. Kalmer, a 1929 graduate of
Pitt, and Chairman of the Gireek
Nationality Room Committee; has
one remark to make to us. lid is:
“Pray every morning and every

Musicians Act
As Guinea Pigs

By Arnold Steinman

The scientiﬁc world has been
paying heed to the marijuana
problem and has been attacking it
from a musician’s viewpoint. A-c-
cording to reliable sources, re-
search doctors attached to govern—.
ment prison—hospitals where drug
addicts are conﬁned for care have
been Working on a series of exper-
iments with marijuana, using mu-
sicians as guinea pigs. The ex-
periments are designed to ﬁnd out
the effect, if any, the drug has on
the quality of a musician’s Work.

Volunteers for the tests have
been taken from among inmates
with a musical background. A
musical aptitude test is given each
subject, both while he is in a
normal condition and again while
under the inﬂuence of marijuana.
In this manner the doctors hope to
determine why some musicians are
attracted to the drug and whether
it -improves the quality of their
playing.

It is no secret that many musi-
cians have been oﬁenders against
the Marijuana Tax Act. The rec-
ords show this but the facts have
been over-stated to the point
where the public believes all mu-
sicians and thir friends live in a
perpetual narcotic whirl.

Marijuana derives its name from A

a Mexican slang—word, meaning,
“Mary Jane.” In the United
States, the drug is known as tea,
weed, gauge, reefers, or hemp. In
many sections of the United
States, the plant is grown com-
mercially for the manufacture of
rope, hats, and paper. It can be
cultivated easily in any back yard
or ﬂower pot. Due to its rapid
spread as a stimulant, the Mari-
juana Tax Act was passed in 1937
and a curb put on the growing in-
ﬂuenc of the weed.

Medical men and sociologists re-
gard the drug as a stimulant, hav-
ing the same physical and mental
effects as alcohol. Unlike drugs
such as cocaine and heroin, Mari-
juana does not addict its user with
an insatiable craving. Stories and
movies about marijuana users have
misinterpreted the drug habit.

In contrast to the accepted pr

The Sailors mopped up virtually
all opposition, both college and
service, last year and were ranked
third among the nation’s service

teams. Ohio State’s reputation in

itself.

In preparation for the opener at

into the following teams:

The ranks of the Panthers were

Glad to see that Pitt women
perked up and took notice of last

looked more like the real thing
last Friday. There is still room for
more girls, so let’s see some more
of that grand spirit.

The Volleyball tournament will
deﬁnitely begin next Monday at
3:30 o’clock. There will be a sign
on the bulletin board on the
ground floor of the Cathedral
where all women interested in
entering the tournament can sign
up. Mrs. Butler in the girls’ lock-

Features Pitt-O.S. U. Battle

By Al Roth

Clark Shaughnessy has brought his injury—riddled Panthers back to Pittsburgh for their
ﬁnal home stay of the current season, with hopes for an upset over one of the ﬁnal three oppon-
ents. Such a victory would somewhat brighten what has been a dismal season for the Oakland
Jungle Cats. This Saturday afternoon the Panther coaching staﬁ will send their patch—quilt

lineup against the

Western Conference champs have
only been beaten once, on a sur-
prise uprising by Purdue who
swamped the Bucks 36-13. On
the other hand they have taken

the measure of ﬁve other oppon-
ents and again are in the chase
for the title. The Ohioans are
under the rein-s of Carroll C‘. Wid-
does, ex-side-kick of Paul Brown.

Among the Buckeye squad mak-
ing the trip from Columbus are
416 returning lettermen. Severest
losses from last year’s champion
club were a quartet of All-Ameri-
cans, back Les Hor-vath, end Jack
Dugger, tackle Bill Willis, and
guard Hackett. O-thers who left
the campus were such- stalwarts
as center Gordon Appleby, half-
back Bob Brugge, quartenback
Tom Keane, and end “u_Cy” Soud-

Pitt will {be Ohio letter-"winners;
end Don Steinberg, tackles Russ
Thomas, and Thornton Dixon,
guards Warren Amling’ and Bob
McGinnis, quarterback Robin Pri-
day, half-back Dick Fisher and
fullback Ollie Cline. The remain-
ing three starters are 17 year old
freshmen; center Jack Lininger
is a 193 pounder from Van Wert,
Ohio, end Tom Watson from Ur-
bana, Ohio, and shifty Harold
Daugherty hails from Weirton,
W. Va., and ﬁlls the left half post.
Left tackle Thomas, -at 223
-pounds is the heaviest man on the
Buck’s roster, and is another citi-
zen from the mountaineer state,
having starred at ,Huntin.gton.
Fisher carries the most p-oundage
in the Ohio State backﬁeld, hov-
ering around the ZOO--pound mark.
This contest with Ohio State
-will be part of the celebration
commemorating the 170th anni-
versary of the founding of the
United States Marine Corps.

‘Panthers Fight Hard;

Lose to Purdue, 28-O  

Led by the hard driving Ed‘:
Cody, the Purdue Boilermakers
crushed the Pitt Panthers, 28-0,
Saturday. It was the -Purdue bat-
tering ram, Cody, that spoiled
the Panthers’ chances as early as
the ﬁrst quarter. Climaxing two
drives, he scampered over from
the 10 and the 13 yard line.

The Pitt eleven was outclassed
all the way and’ never threatened
the Purdue goa.l seriously. The
Panthers have a legitimate excuse
though, since Wolff, Zimmovan,
and Mattioli were out with injur-
ies and Kosh was not fully recov-
ered from his hip injury.

If anyone starred for Pitt it was
little Vince Manuzzi, who played
his ﬁrst game of the year against
Purdue, and! dashed for several
long gains. Pitt fans should see a
lot of Vince this week -against Ohio
State.

After an exchange of kicks in
the opening quarter -Purdue took
over in Pitt territory and march-
ed, in six plays, into the end zone.
Shortly afterwards Coach Isbell’s
boys again took over in Pitt terri-
tory and in eight plays had scor-
ed again. The Boilermakers’ next
touchdown came as a result of the
“heads up” play of Paul Gilbert,
right end, who stole the ball from
J-ack Smodic and} raced 56 yards
for a score.

Dave Shaw scored: the ﬁnal
touchdown on a sensational run
that covered 50 yards.

Rifle Practice

The Panthers took another one on the chin, but in so doing

played a bang-up game of ball.

Coach Shaughnessy cleaned the

bench and gave everyone a chance to play, except those who received

injuries in the Temple fracus.

In so doing the Pitt mentor found a

left end who will share the duty with Leo Skladany. Al Zellman
played a heads up game of ball and stopped the Boilermakers every-
time they tried to get through the spot between end and tackles.

Another outstanding lineman wase

Mike Rous-sos. Mike is backat
his tackle post and more or less
lunged at the Purdue ball carriers.
According to Mr. Shaughnessy
Mike is at tackle to stay. The
third discovery was that of Tony
Chufﬁ, a former tackle. Tony is
going to be our regular guard, as
long as Fran Mattioli is sidelined.
Tony seems to be a natural at the
guard spot, and we all should be
happy that Shag is discovering
where his ball players belong, for

iwhen next season comes around

the stage of experimentation will
have ended.
Shag Turns Table

At the Monday Press and Radio
football luncheons held at the
University Club in order to keep
everyone posted on the happen-
ings of Pitt football, Clark
Shaughnessy did the unexpected
and asked the sports writers and
announcers what kind of ball to
play against Ohio State. Mr.
Shaughnessy asked, “Should we
gamble or should we play a con-
servative game of ball?” The
writers and announcers fumbled
the question around and came up
with a couple of answers. Pie
Traynor is for gambling. Go out
and score a couple of times even
though Ohio State scores a few
more times. Joe Tucker is for
playing a conservative game of
ball, the type we played against
Purdue. What brand should we
play? Tell Shaughnessy at the
Pep Rally.

What is a Gamble?

No doubt you want to know
what Coach Shaughnessy means
by a gamble; here goes. The ball
is resting on our 25 yard line,
third down and six to go. The
teams are evenly matched and the
score 0 to 0. The quarterback can
either call a running play or kick.
If we wait until fourth down to
punt, the entire team will be in
at you and according to Shaugh-
nessy, that in college football is
“Inviting Disaster.” Well, you
ﬁgure it out.

A Referee’s Gift

Purdue was given seven points
by the referees Saturday after-
noon. A few minutes before the
ﬁrst half ended Pitt quarterback,
Jack Smodic went back to pass.
A Purdue man hit his hand and
the football fell to the turf only
to bounce chest high into the hands
of a Boilermaker who scampered
over 50 yards for the third touch-
down. Shaughnessy protested this
decision on the grounds that the
ball hit the earth; therefore, it’s
dead, and Purdue recovered a Pitt
fumble. The referee claimed that
the ball didn’t touch; therefore it’s
an intercepted pass, yet the lines-
man dropped his handkerchief at
the spot where he saw the ball
land. Pretty complicated. Isn’t
it? ‘

Word has been received from
the athletic publicity director of
Ohio State University that the
Ohio State band will be at the
game on ‘Saturday.

Olson Awaits Hagan’s Okay

To Organize Track Team

Carl Olson, Pitt track coach, has recently been discharged from the Navy and is now the

head of the University’s physical

education department.

Coach Olson entered the Navy in Sep-

tember of 1942 and served as a lieutenant commander for almost three years and was dis-
charged in August. While in the Navy, he was the head of the physical ﬁtness program for the
first naval district, which includes all New England. His job was to direct the physical train-
ing ofover 300,000 Navy men, among whom were included V—12 trainees.

Coach Olson, who is president of the Track Coaches’ Association of America, started his

Meet the Team

 

For freshmen, both these Pitt boys are doing a swell job and will
be out to stop the Buckeyes come Saturday.

Now that you knvow ﬁve of Pitt’s
seven man line, it is only proper
that you meet the other two
tackles George Johnson and
Anthony Chufﬁ, the tallest and
shortest linemen on the squad.
George stands 6 feet 3% inches
while Anthony is -only 5 feet 7
inches.

George, a Physical Education
major, hails from German ‘Town-
ship Highi where he played» guard,
tackle, and end':. Of the three posi-
tions, he prefers tackle for he be-
lieves it’-s the roughest spot. Be-
sid-es playing footba-ll, George was

a letterman in track, basketball
and baseball. He likes football,
though especially college football,
because “it’s faster and rougher.”

Anthony, also a Physical Educa-
tion major, graduated from Pea-
body High where he played tackle
for two years and did a little tracl-:
work. He feels right at home play-
ing the tackle position for the
Pitt eleven. Anthony was a little
leary about answering questions
for the News, but he didn’t hesi-
tate to admit that ‘the Notre Dame
squad was the toughest team he
has run up against in a long time.

‘athletic career in high schoo1.at

Ashtabula, Ohio, where he par-

ticipated in football, basketball,
and track. Olson continued his
schooling at Springﬁeld State

Teachers’ College in Massachusetts
where again he participated in the
major sports. Upon completion of
his college career, he became a
coach at Frobel High School in
Gary, Indiana, where his teams
copped seven straightgstate track
championships and one ﬁeld cham-
pionship. »

In 1932 Carl Olson was appoint-
ed Pitt track coach. He came here
with the slogan “Track for Fun
and Health.” The track program
was planned so that everyone who
possibly could would participate’.
Hundreds of thinclads practiced
religiously. Weather permitting,
the stadium was ﬁlled with sprint-
ers, and the hillsides in Schenley
Park were dotted with cross-coun-
try runners. Came winter and
ﬁeld meets were held every Sat-
urday afternoon in the ﬁeld house
by Trees Field. Track became
popular. Coach Olson distributed
cards reading “Take a Crack at
Track.” More boys came out. Two
practice squads were set up-one
for the freshmen and one for the
upperclassmen. A record board
was set up in the ﬁeld house and
two sets kept—one for the fresh-
men and one for the varsity.
Coach Olson had his eyes open——-
slowly but surely he singled out
the boys he considered varsity ma-
terial, but even after the varsity
squad was chosen, the meets con-
tinued and those track enthusi-
asts who weren’t chosen still kept
up their interest.

Through this plan, Coach Olson
developed many famous stars.
Johnny Woodruff, the miler, Hap
Stickel, low hurdler, and Bill Car-
ter, who ran the 60 yard dash and
broad-jumped are some of the
boys who have shined under 01--
son’s tutelage here at Pitt. Now
that the war is over perhaps we
will again have track here at the
University. We have the coach
who is tops in his ﬁeld. We have
the facilities——-a huge stadium and
indoor track. Last but most im-
portant of all we have the ma-
terial. You just can’t miss having
a fairly good track team with
speedsters like Jimmy Joe Robin-
son, Herb Douglas, and Allan Car-

Reconvoision Hits Pitt Campus;

Co-eds Playing Hard to Get

The conﬂict is climaxed and “reconversion” is here! If you don’t
believe it, just meander and take a gander. For instance, campus
males no longer wear that air of bored predominance, so noticeable
during past semesters, as they realize that the proportions of the two
sexes are gradually approaching a more even ratio. Even the cor-
ridors have a different atmosphere, and no longer do gay clusters of
fraternity men gallop along while fervidly baritoning in unison, “We

Don’t Care Who Knows It, We’re°
In Love With Us.”
Women’s fraternities no longer

stretch low wires from booth to
booth. in the ‘Tuck Shop in an at-
tempt to shanghai a fair turnout
for awftahnoon tea dzawnces. The
girls, themselves, are slowly
learning all ove-r again to give out
with the pre-war clinging vine at-
titude in contrast to the “O. K.
bud, you’re mine” method. of the
past four years. Profs are getting
downright touchy about -cuts and
even go so far as to expect as-
signments on time». There is even
a rumor going around that two

around to watch them too. Among
the lighter sides of this era call-
ed “reconvoision” is the return of
cigarettes to their former abund-
ance which means the sweet young
things, to young to die, no longer

or savage maiming in Tuck Shop
