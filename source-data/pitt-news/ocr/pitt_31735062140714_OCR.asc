To Active Duty
in Air Corps

Army Air Forces began calling _,
Pitt Students enrolled as APLly.v":;

Air Corps Reserves to active serv-

ice on Monday, February 15. Let-, 
ters ordering the reservists to ac- _ ¢
tive duty are ‘still being mailed, 
but no advance lists of selectees "

have been given to Lawrence Ir-. 

win, liaison oﬂicer at the University.

Some letters received by Pitt re-‘ 
servists are six to twelve hour, 
alerts; the remainder are straight:
calls to service on Monday, Feb-_V
ruary 22. These boys will be sen ‘

to Miami, Florida for their Avi‘:-it
tion Cadet Technical training.

No further information’ is avail-:,

lem as the Navy program has not
yet reached the stage of comple-

tion.

The Army has recently re-_.
scinded an order stating that

vides transportation for these

boys from their homes as well as _, '0

Hospitalization

Time Extended

Saturday, February 27, is the I
last day to register for hospital- '-
ization, according to Dr. H. C» ‘

Carlson and Dr. Aulene M. Jami-

son of the Student Health Serv- A

ices.

This plan, sponsored by The
Pitt News and the health services,
gives the student room and board
in ward accommodations for 21
days of the school year or an al-
lowance of $3 per day toward pri-
vate or semi-private rooms.

The charge is $2.25 per semes- 

ter, and is payable at the Treas-

urer’s Office-, 2409 Cathedral.
Due to the uncertainty of stu-

dent’s terms, a provision has been

made for a refunding of money . » i
when a student is called into the , at

armed forces. The unexpired porv 
tion will be refunded on a weekly 1 0

basis‘ of payment.

On Monday, February 22, in

ception of the Schools of Medicine

,- _.  Again the students of the world are asked to contribute to
:3 World Student Service Fund, an agency set up to alleviate
the problems of students and teachers who through_ the catas-
rtrophe of war have become prisoners, refugees, and internees.
 ' " The Fund works on the principle that through “helping

  

   

_-the. world is building for the future, for certainly the world
.“of tomorrow will need leaders withjsound minds and bodies.
Today’s military officers mostly former students, will be to-
morrow’s civil leaders of reconstruction. And many of these
officers have been captured and interned to be released only at
  the completion of the war.

' _ But what will they do during the days, months, and
' maybe years before armistice is signed and prisoners of war
exchanged? Days of tense excitement of battle are suddenly
supplanted by days of quiet and ennui. With-out books, news-

papers these men endure their silence which could be greatly
helped by little outside aids which we consider commonplace.

The World Student Service Fund endeavors to help such
prisoners by giving them books and also food a.nd clothing
‘ when the necessity demands. It can accomplish these deeds
because of the treaty signed at the Geneva Convention of 1929
which provided that only the International Red Cross and the
War Prisoner’s Aid of the YMCA are permitted to enter prison
camps. Although their basic physical needs are provided by
the captor governments, these student risoners of war and
enternees are in desperate need of inte lectual‘relief—--other-
wise they face moral disintegration and the morose feeling
, that _no onevis concerned about them. »»

Stamp, Bond Committee
Sets Goal For Fourth Year

Culmination of a successful year
came yesterday for the War Stamp

and Bond Committee as it moved
along on its fourth year.

Although, on several occasions,
sales have approximated the
‘ $3200 mark established on Mac-
Arthur Day. That mark still
stands as the top sales record in
the history of the drive. Only
recently, highest commendation
for the University drive has come
from Mrs. Charlotte Young, the
executive secretary of Allegheny
war savings-stamp staﬂ'.

Sales totals for the entire drive
have already eclipsed the $30,000
mark, and present indications are
that the drive has lost none of its
popularity.

Under present plans, a diﬁerent
women’s fraternity aids the sales
committee each week, and at the
same time, all of the men’s frater-
nities are maintaining a constant
competition among themselves in
sales of stamps and bonds.

Based on an arbitrary price of
