Lucey Predicts Win for Anderson
VP Candidate Speaks at Lawrence Hall

By NICK ARNETT
Pitt News Staff Writer
John Anderson is going to win

LUcey, Anderson’s running mate,
“in a way the Jimmy Carter and
Ronald "Reagan would never dream
of - he’s goint to win it on the
issues.”

The vice-presidential candidate

was on campus courting the student
vote in David Lawrence Hall.
Lucey, former governor of Wiscon-
sin and ambassador to Mexico,
came at the invitation of Dr. Trevor
Melia and Mark Patterson, a Pitt
student.
‘ Lucey said Carter is “hiding
from the American people in the
Rose-Garden,” while Reagan, if
elected, “will apply 19th century
solutions to late 20th century pro-
blems. ‘

“There is a good reason Jimmy
Carter refuses to debate,” Lucey
said. “He knows he can’t defend-
his ideas or his record. And _the're’s
a good reason Ronald Reagan
agrees to debate--he doesn’t have
any ideas to defend.”

Lucey attacked those who label
Anderson the “spoiler” in this elec-
tion by saying, “It is the candidate
who won’t appear before the people
in free and open debate who spoils

according to Pat .

the political process,” drawing ap-
plause from the standing-room-
only crowd.

Lucey said it is a “myth” that
Carter is a “nice, decent, honest
man.” He accused Carter of abus-
ing the “dignity of his office” by
awarding federal grant money to
cities and states whose leaders have
supported him. Lucey quoted
former president Richard Nixon as

having said, “He (Carter) is very‘

tough, and very shrewd. . .and he’s
going to use the presidency to the
hilt.” -

“He _(Nixon)‘ought to know.”
Lucey quipped. V

Lucey cited another “myth”

about the president--that Carter is a
democrat. Lucey accused Carter of
failing to live up to a 1976 campaign
promise of never using “unemploy-
ment and recession as a tool to fight
inflation.” Lucey said that’s just
what Carter has done.

Anderson’s partner devoted
much less time to attacking Ronald
Reagan. Lucey said Reagan “has
not even come up with a new cliche

in the last 12 years, let alone a new .

idea. I think he will enjoy many
more years of happy retirement,

. watching ‘Little House, on the

79!,

Prairie. : — - _ , _
In a question-and-answer session

after his speech, Lucey was asked
what he and Anderson would do to
ease financial burdens on_ college
students. '

“Principally it would be an ex-
pansion of ‘the loan program for
students,” he said, “and the
possibility of qualifying for a loan
program even when the families are

_ middle-class families.” Lucey said

Anderson has demonstrated a firm

commitment to aiding education in _

the past. *

Asked about military spending,
Lucey responded, “John Ander-
son’s position is that he is opposed
to draft registration. He feels that
we ‘should have some increase in the
Pentagon budget, and a very high
priority in this budget would be an
increase in compenstion‘ amd fringe
benefits to people in the volunteer
army so you could attract quality
people and so you could keep them
once they are trained.” Lucey said
he doesn’t think the volunteer army
has “been adequately tested,

” because we haven’t compensated

'well enough to attract bright young
people into it.”

, Professor Melia, who introduced
Lucey as ‘.‘possibly the next vice-
president~of the United States,”

.said‘heinvit_ed Lucey as part of “an Anderson’s going to “win it on the issues. .

Campaign '80: iProfesso’r, Editor Analyze Candidates, Press  

By MARY KANE
Pitt News Staff Writer

The 1980 presidential candidates
are “sadly inarticulate” concerning
the future of this country, and the
objectivity « of press coverage is
questionable, according to two lec-
turers who spoke separatelyat Pitt
this week. V

Theodore Windt, a,profcssor of
rhetoric and communication in
Pitt’s speech department, talked

, about the candidates and the issues,

and Michael McGough, the Pitt-
sburgh Post-Gazette associate
editor, spoke on press coverage of
the campaign.

Windt told the Phi Eta Sigma
honor society that he looks at the
1980 campaign -with “confusion,
apprehension, indecision and

‘ fear.”

“Although the candidates have
been specific about specific issues, I
find them sadly inarticulate concer-
ning the greaterissue of the direc-
tion of this country,” Windt said.
“We are entering into a critical period
in American history,” and major
changes have to occur in domestic
and foreign policy for the U.S. to
prepare for the 21st century.
Windt, in analyzing the campaign,
said the issues are divided into

media issues and policy issues:

“Media issues are issues that last
only through the campaign,” he
said. “They have no ramifications
beyond the campaign.” Such issiies
arise in the media-because they are
striking. He added that in 1976, 60
percent of television and newspaper
coverage was devoted to these

, media issues.

President Carter’s statement in a
1976 playboy interview that he
“lusted in his heart” after other
women and Gerald Ford’s remark
that Eastern Europe was not under
Soviet domination were cited by
Windt as examples of media issues.

Police Look for Suspect in Walker Murder

By MIKE MALLINGER
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pittsburgh homicide detectives
are searching for a clean-shaven 6
foot 3 inch, 145 pound black man
as a suspect in the execution—style
slaying of Pitt senior Robert
Walker.

The 21 year-old theater arts ma- .

jor was slain Saturday in an ap-

parent robbery at Martini Imports,
a shoe store located at 119 Meyran

. Ave. in Oakland.

Walker, an employee of the store
since the beginning of September
was found in the basement of the
store with his arms and legs tied and
a cloth wrapped around his head at
approximately 2:40 p.m. Saturday.

Police have no other leads as to i

the identity of the person or persons
responsible for Walker’s death, ac-
cording to homicide detective John
McLaughlin.

Police were alerted to the
possibility of the robbery-murder
when attempts by the store’s owner,
Sumner Goodwin, to reach .Walker
by phone failed. , _

Finding for State-Relateds to   be Restored

- By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG - Gov. .Thorn-
burgh said Tuesday he will sign
legislation that would restore $336
million in funding cuts thaty he
made in budgets for state-related
universities and institutions.

That announcement, in the wake
of House passage of the funding
bills, means that Penn State,
University of Pittsburgh and Tem-

ple University will receive the full
budgets approved by the
Legislature—last June.

The additional funding was made
available by the state Liquor Con-
trol Board, when it approved a new
pricing system that raised prices for
some 1,200 inexpensiv brands of
wine and liquor.

“While I do not totally embrace

the final action of the LCB which

paved the way for the final resolu-
tion of this problem, I am pleased
that these institutions will not face
budgetary cutbacks,” Thornburgh
said.

The bills approved by the House
and Senate do not actually providee
the $336 million in funding. They
just authorize the governor to use
any extra that he has to restore the
funding cuts. -

“(Carter’s remark) got terrific
media play” Windt said. “What
did it have to do‘ with electing a
gentleman to run the country?”

Windt explained that there are
clear choices among the candidates
on these specific issues:

—Establishing some kind of ar-
rangement beyond SALT VI and
detente with the Soviet Union:

Windt explained -that Anderson
and Carter seem to recognize a need

for such an agreement, and want to »

avoid the possibility of a confronta-
tion with the Soviet Union.
Reagan, on the other hand, prefers
taking a hard line against the
Soviets, and previously stated that

he thought the ‘U.S. should have
blockaded Cuba in retaliation for

the Russian invasion of
Afghanistan. ' ’
-Relations with the People's

Republic of China: _

‘Anderson and Carter hold similar
views on this subject, according to
Windt. Carter has recognized the
People's Republic and broken
Taiwan relations. Reagan has sug-
gested establishing relations with
Taiwan, which will violate the
previous China agreement, Windt
said. - ‘

-Middle East:

The strongest supporter of Israel
is Anderson, who has stated that if
Israel moved her ,capital to
Jerusalem, the U.S. should
recognize it as the capital and move
its embassy there, Windt said.
Carter has a record of active and
personal involvement in the Middle
East situation, but Reagan does not
believe it is in our best interest to be

directly involved in the situation
and would limit involvement.

-Arms Race: «

Windt said Reagan would at-
tempt to fuel the arms race,'and
supports building of the BA
bomber and the MX missile. Windt
believes Carter will continue with
his previous spending policy,
although (due to) the Afghanistan
invasion the president has been
spending more on arms.

‘‘I don’t see him spending the
kinds of money I anticipate Reagan
will be spending,” Windt said.

Anderson opposes the MX missile, ‘

and would attempt to ‘wind down
spending, he added. ’-
“To me, this is one of the most
important issues,” Windt said.‘
,“The United States and Russia are
gearing up the arms race.” If the
U.S. continues to spend money on
arms, prices will continue to rise
and there will be less and less money

available in a shrinking economy _

for domestic needs, Windt said.
Concerning domestic policies,

' Windt explained that there are clear

differences among the candidates
also.

“Reagan’s domestic policy
hinges on two issues,” he stated.-
Reagan plans to make a 30 percent
tax cut over the next three years,
and wants to de-emphasize the
federal government's role in the
private sector of the economy.

“That is his domestic program in
its entirety,” according to Windt.
Reagan believes government in-
volvement in the private sector
causesinflation, and that if the in-

New Director of

Getting to the root of campus
crime before it occurs will'be the
top priority of William Tucker,
recently appointed director kof
Pitts department of public saftey,
formerly known as the campus
police department.

“In addition to crime prevention,
we will focus on such thingsas pro-
perty recovery and informing
students what their rights are in
terms of the law,” Tucker, who is a
21 year veteran of the Washington
D.C.’ Metropolitan police said.

Tucker said ‘that larceny of
university and students property
seems to be the largest source of
crime on campus.

He said he will work to educate
all members of the university com-
munity to /protect themselves
against such crimes.

“People have to realize that if

4 they leave their purse in an unlock-

ed office where 1,000 other people

pass through during the day. there's _

a good ‘chance that _it’s not going to
last too long,” Tucker said.
Tucker, who has only been on the
job a week, said that he will rely
heavily on students, faculty and

other members of the university ‘

community to carry out his hopes
for lower rates of campus crime.
“Saftey ‘is not the sole respon-

i sibility of any one department. It is

a combined responsibility,” Tucker
said. “We can only be as effective
as the students, faculty and staff
help us to be.”_

Tucker said that in some cases
members of the community must
serve as the eyes and ‘ears of the

police department, reporting
suspicious sightings to the’ depart-
ment when police are not in the
area.

“I’d like students to believe that
we provide a high quality profes-
sional service, serving the im-
mediate ‘community as best we
can/T,’ Tucker said.

Tucker would not comment on-
whether Pitts budgetary crush has
affected the department by way of
decreased or insufficent manpower.

' ‘‘It appears right now that we
have suitable manpower, but this is
something that needs to be reviewed
in the future,” Tucker said. He ad-
ded that although the department
does have sufficient personnel at
persent, he may implement some
changes in placement of patrol of-
ficers concentrate them in needed
areas depending on different times
of the day, ‘

Tucker said that he can forsee no
“insurmountable” problems in im-
plementing his policies for opera-
tion of the department. Because of
past experience working with
universities in the Washington area,
he is familiar with crime prevention

. on large urban university campus.

Thus far, Tucker has been im-

pressed with the reception of his‘

ideas here at Pitt. “I was told that
Pitsburgh was a very friendly city
with the people being very together

. and very close,” Tucker said.

“And thus far there appears to be
some truth to this. Those students
that I have come in contact with
during the short time I have been
here have been very cooperative and
polite.” .

Middle States Evaluation to Focus

Pitt News Staff Writer

Undergraduate education will be
the focus of a four-day evaluation
to‘be conducted on Pitt’s five cam-
puses next month, according to
Associate Provost Robert Nossen.

Ten evaluators representing the
Middle States Association of Col-
leges and Schools, a regional ac-
creditation organization, will visit

_ the main and b;anch campuses
Nov. 9-12 to take a first-hand look
at Pitt’s’ nine undergraduate
schools. The evaluating team will
meet with administration, faculty,
staff and students during its stay,
Nossen said.

The primary tool to be used by

the Middle States team in‘ its evalua-
tion will be a self-study that has
conducted by Pitt’s
undergraduate schools, support ser-
vice organizations ‘ and academic

“The most important fact is that
we've done the study ourselves,”
Nossen said. When the members of
the evaluating team visit Pitt next
month, they. will have read the
document and will be able to com-
ment on how well university depart-
ments and services seem to be
meeting their stated objectives.

The self-study will be mailed to
the_ evaluators as soon as
Chancellor Wesley Posvar approves
the document. As of yesterday
morning, the chancellor was still
reviewing the report, according to
Nossen’s office.

Posvar said in a July interview
with The Pitt News that the self-
study would be valuable to the
university because it will “result...
(in) a better look at ourselves.”

said. He noted that although par-

students, benefits from taking part

e “It’s a consumer protection to a

‘He pointed out that ac-
creditation by Middle States shows
that the university meets the
minimum standards, of the
organization. In addition, ac-
creditation makes Pitt eligible for
certain grants and student aid pro-
grams, and it facilitates transferral
of Pitt academic credit to other
universities and colleges.

Nossen said that the university’s
decision to have the evaluating team
concentrate on undergraduate
education was made because
“undergraduates are the most im-

portant constituency we have. They S

evaluation because each school has
its own accrediting body, according
to Nossen. Despite the concentra-

however, a favorable evaluation by
Middle States would mean that the
entire university would be reac-
credited.

University of Maryland President
John Toll will chair the visiting
evaluating team when it convenes
for the first time in Pittsburgh Nov.
9. All team members serve on the
administration or faculty of large
universities in the northeast, in-

York. According to Nossen, the
team members have all evaluated at
least one other university or college

Federal Government to Revise  

__..

lnﬂatedHousiigCostFg1res

By GENE GRABOWSKI
Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON-The federal
government says it goofed when it
published inflated Pennsylvania
housing cost estimates this summer.
but it will produce corrected ﬁgures

bythe end of the year,

The erroneous statistics, compil-
ed by the Department of ‘Housing
and Urban Development, had
shown that an average‘ western
Pennsylvania home costs more than
$80,000 to build.

Home builders familiar with that
region’s housing market challenged
those figures after they were picked
up by the press. .

Mike Spera, a supervisor of th
Department of Housing and Urban
Developm‘ent’s Pittsburgh office,
said Tuesday that the errorwas “an
honest mathematical mistake”

made when two of his employees '

were gathering data in February.
“We have a limited amount of

staff, only so much can get done‘
up’

and things get mixed
sometimes,” said Spera, whose of-
ﬁce employs more than 140 people.
. “The staff was at a minimum at
the time and as a result the project
had a low priority. I’m not going to
pin the blame on anybody,” he
said. 0

Spera refused to specify the
nature of the error, saying only that
correct figures would be submitted
to HUD by November. HUD of-
ficials said they are awaiting Spera’s
new data, but were unfamiliar with
cause of the mistake.

According to statistics originally
compiled by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development,
it costs $87,000 to build an average
three bedroom home in Pittsburgh.

n
:

In September 1979, that same

a single-family dwelling in the City

would have cost $50,000, about
$10,000 below l979’s national
average, HUD reported in its an-
nual schedule of prototype housing
costs.

Prototype housing costs, intend-
ed as a loose guide to consumers,
are published annually by -HUD
under congressional mandate.

Housing costs in other western
Pennsylvania communities also
demonstrated startling increases,
according to the erroneous data.

For instance, an average three
bedroom -house in Altoona costs
about $81,600, the Pittsburgh HUD
office reported. Last year, a similar

home would have cost about ~

$44,300, federal figures show.

The incorrect HUD figures also
showed that a modest three-
bedroom home in Johnstown costs
about $71,600.

“The field staffers get this infor-
mation after talking to developers,
people with new mortgages, the
Farmers Home Administration and
the Veterans Administration,” said
HUD spokesman Andy Gasparich.

“This error was spotted in the
Pittsburgh office and the main of-
fice authorized them to send cor-
rected data,” Gasparich said.

Officials refused to speculate on
what the new figures might be. .

“It doesn’t mean a damn thing. I
don’t know why we even do the
damn thing. This is just a range of
what houses cost in a particular
area,” Spera said.

Localism, Special Interests Important to Third Party Candidates

By SCOT STONE
Pitt News Staff Writer

Since the Civil War only four
minor party presidential
candidates-John 'Weaver, Teddy
Roosevelt, Robert La Follette, and
George Wallace-haverpolled more
than '10 percent of the national
vote. This year, John Anderson
hopes to boost that figure to‘ five.
According to Frank Sorauf,
author of “Political Parties in the
American System,” third parties in
the United States, throughout
history, have been parties of
“localism,” and “special
interests.’ ’ ..=
While american history is full of a
rich variety_ of minor parties, only
two, according to Sorauf, have pos-
ed much of a threat to the two-party
system-the States’ Rights Party of ‘

1948, or the Dixiecrats, brokelaway S

educational process.” He added,
“Neither I nor the university en-
dorse any particular candidate.”

“are classes which deal with
rhetoric in a allegedly free society.
My assumption is that students will
benefit from getting a close-up of
the sorts of processes which pro-
duce our leaders.”

tional convention. They ran Strom
Thurmond for President, receiving
1,160,000 popular votes ‘and ‘39
electoral votes from deep south
states. -
George Wallace inherited the
southern constituency of the Dix-
iecrats when he organized the
American Independent Party. Bas-
ed on reaction to federal desegraga-
tion policies and the urban racial
conflict of the late sixties, Wallace
advocated states’ rights as a priority
in his campaign. Running with
Curtis Le May in 1968, Wallace got
the largest return of any indepen-
dent in the twentieth century-13.2
percent of the popular vote and 45
electoral votes. 4
The first attempt by the pro-
gressives to capture the White
House was in 1912, under the ban-
ner of Teddy Roosevelt’s Bull
Moose Party. The Progressives
broke away from the Republicans

-over the tariff issue and regulation

of business. This divisiveness bet-
ween mainstream Republicans and
the Bull Moose Party handed the
election to Democrat Woodrow
Wilson, with 42 percent, of the
popular vote.

The next attempt came for the
Progressives in 1924, when Robert
La Follette again took liberal
Republicans from the party and
fashioned an independent ticket.
With a base of support from small
farmers and labor, he got 4,822,000
popular votes.

The progressives surfaced once
more in 1948, this time as a
Democratic splinter group. Their
candidate, former vice president
Henry Wallace, ran on a platform
of pro-Sovietism and Civil Rights.
Wallace managed to get over a

million popular votes, half of which
came from New York City. -

The Anderson “National Unity
Campaign” is unique in that it has
not formed a party, but follows in a
long tradition of splinter groups
and dissatisfied party bolters.

- “The_choice between Reagan and
Carter did not satisfy. a large
number of voters,” Nan Mathews,

for Western Pennsylvania said, “so

dependent candidacy. But ‘it is not"

Parking tickets are a familiar
headache for many of Pitt’s 28,000
commuters. And it seems to many
commuters that the meter maid
delights in dealing out tickets for
ﬁve-dollar contributions to the city.
But it is the lack of adequateipark-'
ing that causes the problem, not the
meter-maids, according to the meter
maids. I

About 100-150 tickets are written
each day. Since most of the
Oakland‘ parking is taken by
students, it is probably safe to
assume that a majority of those
tickets go to students. Many
students complain that the city
should provide more parking in
Oakland or change all the meters to
four hours.

    

BOY! WAS O

 
 

“This is a real sore spot with us,”

said Rita Garland at the meter maid '

office downtown. _

“The university is responsible for
parking for the students. They
build all those beautiful new
buildings and don’t provide three or
four floors of underground park-
ing. I think the problem iisgthey just
don’t care. .

“The city is only responsible for
providing parking for people com-
ing into the city to visit hospitals or
cultural events or things of that
sort. Those people have a hard time
parking because students use all the

spaces . ’ ’

Garland said there are many
violations that could be written up,
but are not because of the volume
of offenders. ‘

“Legally, we can tag cars for

staying in a space longer than the
signs indicate. If it says two hours,
legally we can time and tag a car for
staying longer. You’re supposed to
park two hours and then get out

and give someone else a chance to 

park,” Garland said.
Garland discussed the problem of
students jamming parking meters.

“It got to the point where there in

were four or five hundred broken
meters a day. *1 wish you would tell
the students that they will no longer
get time at a broken meter. The
meter repairman used to put time
on the meters, but he was told not
to do that anymore.”

Anyone caught jamming the
meters is subject to a fine and a jail
sentence. Garland said that several
people have been arrested for jam-
ming meters and there have been
detectives around the Oakland area

watching for offenders.

- _ Anyone who gets a ticket should

check several things:

—make sure the car make and
license number on the ticket match
yours; ‘ - ‘

—make sure the meter number
on your ticket matches the number
on your meter-. There is a red
number under the glass dome of
every meter;

—before you make a complaint
make sure you know what you’ve
been ticketed for. There are many
violations, of which an expired
meter is only one. ’

If ‘you think your meter ran out

early, don’t send the ticket in. Call

the meter maid office and the meter _

will be checked. If the_ meter is
defective, you will not be responsi-
ble for the ticket.

If you want a ‘hearing with the
meter maid present, call traffic

Campaign
rolvement is s_topped, inﬂation will
:ease, Windt said.

Reagan’s assertions that he will

get government out of the private
ector will be impossible for him to

Harry through if he is elected,
' iecause changes

in government
egulations must come through Con-
;ress. Carter, in 1976, promised, he
vould remove regulations but was
unable to do this because of the
ongress, according to Windt.
Also, Windt explained that
{eagan’s plan to turn over major
axing responsibilities to state and

ocal governments should not be in- ‘
erpreted as a form of revenue shar- -

mg. Reagan’s plan would result in

‘absolute chaos” because federal ,

xcise taxes would then vary from
tate to state, Windt said. States
aving financial difficulties, like
'ennsylvania would have the
ighest taxes.

Windt said that Carter is faced
rith the continual problem of a
3.5 percent inflation rate, and
ight percent unemployment.
Iarter is developing only “band—
id” policies to deal with these pro-
lems. ' ,

Concerning Anderson, Windt
aid that “Anderson made it in the
iedia on two issues.” Anderson
aoke on gun control before a
roup that was strongly against gun
antrol, and the media praised him

Windt. Anderson also proposed a
50 ‘cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline
to offset social security taxes.

Windt said Anderson’s gas tax
plan appears inflationary because if it
carries through, buses, cabs and
trucks would have increased costs
which would be passed on to con-
sumers.

Windt also discussed each can-
didate’s image.

“Carter’s major difficulty is that
he appears to be incompetant and
indecisive.” Windt said. He added
Carter’s competancy was a major
issue in the campaign.

However, Windt said that Carter
is‘ a member of the majority party
and has the power of the incum-
bent.

“I think Jimmy Carter is much '

more at home talking about the
values of America than policies,”
Windt commented. .

Windt also said he believes the
race is basically between Carter and
Reagan.

“I don’t believe he has a
chance,” Windt said of Anderson.
Anderson has no power base, while
Reagan has a base in the West and
Carter has a political base among
Southern Democrats.

Thusfar, Windt believes the 1980
campaign has been a “dirty-cam-
paign.” He cited Reagan’s accusa-
tion that Carter’s, policies were
responsible for the Iran-Iraq war,

and Carter’s charge that Reagan was
a racist as examples.

Windt concluded by saying the
candidates offered no real vision of
America’s future, and no
assurances that the world his
children grow up in will be any bet-
ter.

“I look to the future with ap-
prehension, not without hope, and
jinai1lerrne1trniqi1<.’es;naim,”liesairL

Media coverage of the campaign,
in particular newspaper reporting,
was dealt with by McGough in a
speech sponsored by the University
J.-Ionors Program.

McGough explained that
newspapers are restricted by certain
journalistic conventions from
reporting what they believe to be
the actual- truth about a candidate
or issue. _

Reporters . covering this year’s
campaign are frustrated, especially
by Reagan, according to McGough.
Journalists are required to be objec-
tive, but in some instances,
“reporters are cheating their
readers” because of this.

“The problem is one of objectivi-
'.ty and attribution,” McGough said.
He explained that campaign
:reporters have told him they believe
Reagan to be “intellectually light”,
and that his policies and programs
are basically. developed by speech
writers and advisors.

However, McGough said jour-

nalistic conventions force the
reporter to only state the “who,
what, when, where, and why” of
the situation, therefore mislieading

readers into thinking Reagan had‘

responsibility for the program and
policy.

McGough also said newspapers
tend to cover recent events and
forget what happened in the past.

“There is at fettish in news
coverage with what happened
recently instead of what happened
in the past," McGough said. Daily
newpapers don’t pay too much atten-
tion to what happened in the past.”

McGough believes this tendency
was reflected in the “especially
poor job” reporters did in covering
the early months of John Ander-
son’s campaign.

“News correspondents did a very
poor job of telling what someone
who had been in Congress for
decades had done up until the time
of his candidacy,” McGough said.

“It would be nice if newspapers A’

could do a better job,” he con-
tinued. ’ “But this is difficult with
journalistic conventions.”

McGough added he does not
know if there is a solution to the
problem of adhering to conventions

and reporting accuratelv.

High kicks, broken boards and
Pitt. . .what do they have in com-
mon?. . .The answer: a Karate club
at Pitt. At least this is the hope of
Rich Allison, himself an advanced-
degree black belt and organizer of a
Karate club at Pitt.

Karate is “more than a way of
fighting, more than breaking
boards. It becomes a way, a
philosophy, a way of dealing
with things,” Allison said.

Allison has studied karate for
nine years and has taught profes-
sionallly for seven years in two
schools. He ran a summer camp
program in Mt. Lebanon in 1976,
and is affiliated with the Penn-
sylvania Karate Academy where his
former teacher instructs. Though
still awaiting approval of the club
by the Student Government Board,
he is optimistic that things will be
underway soon in Trees Hall.

While there are “all different
systems of karate and all different
rankings within the system,” the
beginner will start as a first degree
white belt, signifying an empty
vessel, progress through the purple,
green and brown belts and eventual-
ly become a third-degree black belt
if the beginner stays to the end. As
the student advances, he will find
that it takes much more time to

become proficient at each level,
Allison said; I

Because of the diversity in karate
styles, the sport has yet to be
recognized in the Olympics,
although the Amateur Athletics
Union has standardized styles on an
amateur level. ‘

Karate can develop physical,
mental, and spiritual well-being.
The beginner spends part of the
lesson doing calisthenics and part
stretching to prevent muscle pulls.
This comes. after the initial
ceremonial bow. \

In karate “flexibility is a
must,”Allison said. To kick with
power at full speed, the body must

be conditioned to take the assault.
A Women, unlike men, are natural-
ly flexible and able to kick above
their heads.

Karate developed in the Orient
after masters of self-defense watch-
ed thermovements of animals: the
tiger, bear, deer, monkey and bird.
From the tiger they adopted the cat-
like stance for springing when cor-
nered. The open claws of the tiger
were adopted as the open hand for
its gouging ability. The side stance,
which is called closing your
centerline, protects the vital organs.

The phrase “empty hand” is
synonomous with karate. An
emperor, to avoid insurrection,
confiscated weapons from the
peasantry in an attempt to unite the

   

samauri. Without weapons an
empty-handed form of fighting
developed.

To toughen the hands, ancient
karate enthusiasts placed them into
boiling rice. The scar tissue on
toughened hands could crush the
bamboo armour of invading war-
riors.

“Karate is not static. It
developed to fit situations at the
time. Today we have different cir-
cumstances,” Allison said.

Full-contact fighting in America
developed from the Marine Corps
style of training in Korea during the
l950’s. The soldiers returning from
the war found that they had a
marketable skill. Karate became
more scientific as time progressed
with stretching, weight training,
and macrobiotic diets evolving. It
became the skill of self defense.

Monks in the Oriental
monasteries found karate to be a
physical part of a multi-faceted
training. While we expect college to
produce students with diversified
interests, the monasteries tried to
upgrade humanity on all levels.
They found karate to be a means
to spiritual enlightenment.

Registration for the Karate club
will take place in 509 Cathedral of

When unable to reach Walker,
the store-owner phoned a clerk at a
nearby store asking her to check on
Walker’s whereabouts.

The unidentified clerk went to
the store and was greeted by a
stranger who said the Walker has
gone to lunch.

Apparently suspicious of
Walker’s absence, the woman sum-
moned police to the scene who
found Walker, approximately $50
missing from the cash register and
the victims’s wallet gone from his
pocket.

The Bethel Park High School
graduate died at Presbyterian
Hospital late Sunday evening of
wounds inflicted by a small caliber
handgun.

According to Attilio Favorini,
chairman of Pitts speech and
theater arts department, plans are
being made to establish a memorial
scholarship in Walker’s name.

Walker had served as an officer
of Pitts Studio Theater andgserved
as stage manager for Pitts produc-
tion of Hearts and Diamonds last
year.

Pledge Against Isroel Central in Syria/Libya Merger:

By LARRY LUNSFORD

Imagine Pennsylvania and

Florida becoming one state. Pretty

ridiculous you say? True, and
about as ridiculous as Syria and
Libya becoming one country.

In late September, Damascus
Radio broadcast a joint communi-

_ que reporting that Syrian President

Hafez Assad and Libyan leader
Col. Moammar Khadafy had
agreed to merge the two countries.
The unification of the two govern-
ments is expected to be completed

by the end of this month.

If the two countries bordered
each other, more attention might be
paid the planned merger in that it
could offer a true threat to Israel,

against who the merger was
developed; however, Syria and
Libya are more than 800 miles
apart, and the chances of success
for the uniﬁcation are slim to
nothing.

Assad and Khadafy agreed to the
merger on the grounds that the new,
combined Arab state of over 11
million people would be a stronger
force to fight against Israel than
two separate states. It is presumed
that such a combined attack on
Israel would have ‘to come from
Syria since it shares a border with
the Jewish state, and it must also be
pointed out that Libya has never
supplied troops to fight Israel and
there is skepticism as to whether or
not they will start now.

Although the two leaders have

not announced who will_reside over
the new nation nor whatit will be
called, a “Revolutionary
Congress” will assume legislature
powers in the uniﬁed state which
‘will have a single international en-
tity. Analysts of the situation
believe that a joint presiding council
headed by Assad and Khadafy on a
rotating basis will lead the new na-
tion.

Although the pledge against

Israel is the leading factor for the
merger, undoubtedly both leaders
have other reasons for giving up

solitary rule to create a new nation.

Perhaps Khadafy’° oil-rich North
African nation is attractive to the
less

Campus Calendar  

prosperous Syrian nation’s

economy which has been drained

by its decades-old war with Israel.

The growing unrest in this region
that has been heightened by the new
war between Iraq and Iran also may
be an incentive to merge in that the
psychological knowledge that two
countries are better than one in
itself may add incentive to the new
nanon.

This is not the first attempt by
Khadafy at a~merger. An earlier
plan to merge Syria with Egypt and
Tunisia ended in failure, and the in-
dolent Khadafy has never given up
hope of finding another with which
to merge. This newest attempt ap-
pears to be doomed from the start
although the common enemies and
goals of the unified leaders will in-
crease their persistence to make the

unification work. Bringing about
total economic, political, and
military unification should prove
impossible for the two nations so
distant from each other. The
pledge to continue the fighting
against Israel is in itself enough
reason to hope that the new merger
is not successful. ‘ g

Fighting has gone on .in this
volatile region long enough. There
can be .no true victor in the many
battles that seem to erupt almost
daily in a different section of the
region. No country there has been
left untouched by war with either its
neighbor or with another foe in the
region. This new merger is only
another negative force that seems
destined to draw the superpowers
into anotl_i_e_r_ world war.

“The bottom line is to win and
get across the goal-line,” said Pan-
ther head coach Jackie Sherrill at
yesterday’s football press con-
ference. He was referring to a ques-
tion concerning a lack of rushing
explosiveness by ‘the Pitt offense.

with only 51’ yards" on the ground

Pitt’s offense was mostly gained

might get dressed and run this
week.”

Pitt’s offense will meet a
Seminole defense that is nationally
ranked right behind Pitt’s in every
major category. Florida State is
ﬁfth against the score (6.2 points
per game), ninth in total defense

  Split end Willie Collier was the outstanding player

Between Dan 4
Marino and Dan Daniels, the pass-'

(211.2 yards per game), and 14th
against the rush (99.0 yards per
game).

The big gun for the Seminole
defense is _ consensus all-america
Ron Simmons, a 6-1, 242-pound-
senior. Only problem is that Sim- .
mons has been hampered by an
ankle sprain since the first game of
the year.

“Our defense has played well so
far,” said Seminole head coach
Bobby Bowden. ‘.‘Ron Simmons
has been hurt by the sprained ankle,
and even though he played against
Miami two weeks ago, he was not
effective and came out of the game
worse than he went in.” ' '

Bowden will decide whether Sim-
mons will start against Pitt depen-
ding upon how ‘well Simmons can
practice this week. According to
the Seminole coach, however, Sim-
fnons is a good bet to start.

“If he can walk by Friday, yeah,
he’ll‘start.”

Florida State’s defense seems to
be the biggest problem on Pitt’s
hands this week. Coming off an
18-14 win" over then third-ranked
Nebraska, a game which State trail-
ed 14-0 at one point, the defense
looks to be at its peak, with or
without Simmons.

“It (the win over Nebraska) was
the biggest on a national scale ever’
at Florida State,” said Bowden.
“We got key turnoversand really
tightened up in the second half.”

Bowden was not as pleased with!
his offense, however.

“We’re not very good offensive-
ly,” the Seminole coach said. “Our
quarterback has more running abili- »
ty but he doesn't pass as well.”
Bowden was referring to this year’s
starting quarterback, Rick ~

Stockstill, compared to last year’s
tandem of Wally Woodham and
Jimmy Jordon. Florida State lived
by the pass last season because
Woodham and Jordon were classic
drop-back passers. Despite the dif-

against Maryland offensively with seven catches

121 yards and one touchdown.

'tt-FSU Could Be Aerial Show

Pitt’s defensive end coach Ray Zinglertells the media about his two
prize ends, Hugh Green and Ricky Jackson, at yesterday s press

conference.

ferent look at Florida State, Sherrill
expects a wide-open game.

“The kicking game has helped
them this year because they’re not
as explosive as last year,” Sherrill
said. “They’re working up to it. I
think. they will open it up this week
air.” '

The Seminole kicking game is in-
deed very strong. According to
Sherrill, that was what kept them in
the game against Nebraska. Punter
Rohn Stark averaged 48.4 yards a
kick and placekicker Bill Capece
kicked four field goals, two from
outside 40 yards, to keep the
Seminoles in the game.

According to Bowden,_ the
Seminoles have never played two
such good teams back. to back
(Nebraska and Pitt).

“This is the toughest schedule at
Florida State,” he said.

Bowden said he had other things
to worry about than the tough
schedule. He guarantees the team
won’t let down, but he admitted
that Pitt’s defense is better than
that of Nebraska, and the Corn-
huskers have the best defense the
Seminoles have played thus far this
year. Bowden cited the Panther’s
quickness and aggressiveness while
on defense.

Offensively, the coach has to
contend with the right arm of Dan
Marino. According to- Bowden, he
has never faced a quarterback com-
parable to Marino. .

“Dan Marino will dominate
quarterback the next three years,”
he said. In addition to Marino,
Pitt’s offensive line worries Bowden
because “they’re so big physically,

I'm worried we won’t get to the .

passer.”

Pitt’s defense has been awesome
in recent weeks. The unit is present-
ly second in the nation against the

rush (31.0 yards per game), (third,

 

and 'we’ll see a lot of balls in the

against scoring (5.0 points per
game), and fourth in total defense
(177.7 yards per game). The Pan-
thers have been led on defense by
the “book-ends”, Ricky Jackso
and Hugh Green. —
“They are two of the best-maybe
identical-ends in the country,” said
Pitt defensive end coach Ray
Zingler. “I don’t know if I coach

. them. I learn from them as much as

I give them as coach.”

They both play with such intensi-
ty to the point of intimidation.
Hugh and Ricky are the best foot-
ball players in the country,” Zingler
continued.

“It’s nice playing with Hugh,”
said senior Ricky Jackson, referring
to playing in Green’s shadow at
Pitt. “We-help each other out as
we go.”

The Florida State game is a kind
of homecoming . for Jackson,
originally hailing form that state_
But he keeps it in perspective.

“I take every game the same; I
know what I got to do and I do it,”
he said.

Not only has the Panther defense
been playing well, but the offense
has vastly improved. The passing
attack for Sherrill’s team is simply
spectacular. Marino had a splendid
day against Maryland, going i6 for
34 with 282 yards and three
touchdowns. The receiving tandem
of Willie Collier and Dwight Collins
has given Marino two threats: Col-
lins, the flashy freshman with
outstanding speed and the senior
Collier, a sly master at catching the
ball in traffic. Collier caught seven
passes for 121 yards and one
touchdown, while Collins caught
two passes for 86 yards, both
touchdowns. “

Outside of Simmons, Sherrill is
concerned with the Florida State
secondary. That unit returns three
starters from last ,years_ squad“, in-

eluding Bobby Butler who, accor-
ding to Sherrill, is “probably the
best defensive corner in the coun-
try.” The Seminoles also play their
linebackers five yards deeper than
usual on pass coverage to make it
more difficult to throw.

Bobby Bowden, as most Pitt
followers remember, was the coach
at West Virginia before he took
over at Florida State in 1977. When
told that his former team was
traveling to Hawaii this week, he
said “I think I should "be there with
them.”

Soccer Team Wins Fifth Consecutive Game

By ANNA ARLOTTA

The Pitt soccer team put in
another very successful weekend
with two consecutive ‘shutouts over
Gannon College and Grove City.
The wins on Friday and Monday
respectively marked ~ three ac-
complishments for the Panther
booters in their winning 1980
season: one, the Panthers are now
sporting a 7-2 record; two, the team
has now won five consecutive
games; and three, the Panthers are
undefeated at home after nine
games. These three fetes are
something that the Pitt booters
have not been exposed to for quite
some years.

A week ago the Panthers were
given an honorable mention in their
_district which consists of all teams
in the states of Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, and Delaware. This week
that is expected to move into the
top ten on the list. Heading up that
list of top teams in the mid-atlantic
region is Panther rival Penn State.
Pitt and the Nittany Lions will go
head to head when the Panthers
return home on Wednesday, Oc-
tober'22. A win over the Nittany
Lions could be a gigantic jump for

,the_Panther booters in the mid-

atlantic ratings. If the season ends
with Pitt in the top four on that list
the Panthers will move on to post
season play; something that Pitt has
not been involved with since 1965.
Also on the list of ac-
complishments this fall of 1980 is
the team’s high ranking in the
Western Pennsylvania Inter-
collegiate Soccer Conference. That
encompasses all the local clubs that
Pitt faces separated into two divi-
sions. Pitt is now in second place in
Division One play since they have
been defeated earlier in the season
by Slippery Rock. That loss to Slip-
pery Rock was the last the Panthers
have had. .
Individually, the Panthers booter
are faring well. Sophomore wing
Eric Tiedtke is leading the WPISC
scorers with a total of ten _points.
Tiedtke has scored seven goals and
assisted on three others. Also in the
top ten scoring leaders from the
Panther squad is center forward
Bob Hughes with six goals and two
assists from a total of eight points,
and Troy Norton, Pitt’s other wing,

with two goals and two assists for a
total of four_points. The three com-
pose the front line of the Panther’s
attack. Also, Panther keeper Scott
Thunberg, with four shutouts is just
two away from tying the Pitt season
record of six.
against Grove City on Monday, the
Panther’s start in the first half was
likened to fighting against a storm,
by sweeperback Don Bowen.

“We weathered a strong Grove
City storm in the first half and suc-
cessfully ended the first half of play
with a 0-0 tie,” he said. “Then we
came storming out ourselves in the
second half and Grove City just
couldn’t handle the pressing team
attack‘ that we were giving out.”

Pitt started to jell together at the
end of the first half of play against
Grove City_. -A good deal of action
took place around the goal mouth
guarded by Panther keeper
Thunberg. Although the
Wolverines did not take many
shots, Thunberg only had to save
one ball all afternoon; that one
coming in the half. Once again the
Panther defensive unit Bowen, Tom
Treupus, Tom Kunkel and Jim
Hackworth, reigned supreme.

Going back into the second half
of play, the Panthers decided that
too much time had gone by for no

scoring to have taken place. That .

matter was cleared up when Tiedtke
and Hughes combined for a
beautiful shot past the outstretched
arms of Grove City goalkeeper
Frank _Cerminara. Hughes took a
ball from Tiedtke on the right wing
and ' headed it into the nets.
Hughes, who is an excellent jumper
for head balls, was in the air and
ready for contact. Four minutes
later, freshman Nick Wilson, who
started the second half in place of -
the injured Chris Richmond, scored
the second goal of his young Pan-
ther career. Wilson powered one
from the left side of the field to the
far post which Cerminara couldn’t
control. The Panthers were up 2-0
and very secure; Although ‘there
was no further scoring in the re-
maining minutes of the game, Pitt
continued to out shoot Grove City
and dominate play. The first half
had ended with the Panthers on top
of shooting ten shots to nine. The

- game ended with Pitt in the lead 23

In Pitt’s contest-

shots to 12 for Grove City.

“We finally found a way to link
all the lines of play together,” said
co-captain Al Adellmann. “We put
together the defense, the midfield
and the attackers along with Scotty
back in the goal and everything is
working out excellent. Last season

we hada good defense and offense ‘

but this year we're finally putting
those all together.”

In Friday’s contest against Gan-
non the Panthers displayed a
similar type of controlled play.
Distribution throughout the lines
has improved so extensively from a
year ago that the Panthers are able

-to think about more advanced types
of play than simple passing of the
ball among team members.

Scoring did not begin until ‘ten

minutes into the second half when

the wing Tiedtke took a ball from
fullback Tom Kunkel, broke away
nd u‘shed the ball ast Gannon’s

  

      

Nick Sala in the nets. The goal was
Tiedtke’s seventh, posing a threat
to all his opponents. Despite his
small size (5-7 and 130 pounds)
Tiedtke is able to speed past the
much bigger defenders and power
his way to the goal.

Another threat to the Panthers
competition is the play just to the
left of Tiedtke, center forward
Hughes. The junior had been play-
ing exceptional soccer throughout

the season, scoring as he did against A

Gannon. After the Tiedtke goal,
Hughes took a pass from midfielder
Adelmann, controlled the ball to
the goal mouth and popped one
past the goalie.

Pitt was unsuccessful a number
of times in the first half as the
booters totally dominated Gannon
outshooting them 21-4: Most of the
game was played around the Gan-
non net.

“One of the keys to the win over
Gannon,” said fresman Chris Rich-

mond, “was the offense being so ef- '

fective. I think that a good part of -
that was due to the play of Danny
(Hamm). , He played center
halfback just great. He layed back
as he was supposed to and marked
up very well on his man. I think he
played the best game of the
season.” ,

The two teams played in a
downpour throughout the entire
first half. The rain was reminiscent
of a year ago when the Panthers
season was filled with Friday night
play on wet turf. The dampness
caused a good deal of slipping and
sliding, although Pitt was still able
to take every bit of control. Pitt
considered itself a bit lucky at times
last year on the wet turf, but this
season the luck was changed to a

hindrance.

EVENING STUDENTS

  

 

The next season, Green began
four years as a defensive end who
could bring the Pitt crowd to its feet
by putting a quarterback on his
seat. Now he’s a senior, aiming to
lead Pitt to the top again.

“I just wish I could stay here
three or four more years. I, wish
this all could continue,” Green said
this week.

It’s the nature of the game that
offensive players like Dorsett draw
more attention than defenders like
Green. Rut Sherrill will tell you
that professional football scouts

I hold Green in the same high regard

as they did Dorsett.

“The pro scouts who come in
here and watch Hugh on film say
he’s the most productive college
player in America today down for
down,” said Sherrill, who was a
Pitt assistant when he helped recruit
Dorsett and then signed. Green in
his-first year head coach.

Like Dorsett, Green does not
possess imposing size. He’s 6 feet

' '2, 222 pounds. But his muscles are

lean and hard, he has the strength
of a player 40 pounds heavier, and
his time of 4.5 in the 40 yard dash

puts him in a category with most

‘running backs.

‘ Beyond his speed, _ Green" has
great strength. Though he has only
recently gotten into weight-lifting,
he can fight most blockers off with
his hands.

“I really feel sorry for an offen-
sive tackle going against him,” says
Sherrill. “He is just so quick and so
strong.”

Though he is listed as a defensive
end, Green sometimes plays in the
middle as a line backer, and

_ sometimes he aligns himself as an

outside linebacker and drops into
pass coverages.

But Green's most spectacular
playscome when he is chasing the
passer. He leads Pitt with six sacks
this season.

“When they are gonna’ pass, my
job is to get in the quarterback’s
face and bring him down,” said

J Green.

Whenever he makes a thudding
tackle, the Pitt crowd booms
“Hugh” in unison, sending a wave
of excitement through the stadium.

four years,” Green noted. ‘‘It’s a

“Hugh Green played another just

said after the Maryland game.

“If he keeps playing well, we
keep winning and the defense keeps
gaining national recognition, he has
a chance to win the Heisman.” Just
like Tony Dorsett.

The Pantherette netters suffered
their second loss of the season, this
Qime to West Virginia University by
a score of 8-1. The loss drops the
Pantherette’s record to 2-3 with
four dual matches rem_aining.
The Lady Mountaineers clinched
the match in the singles competi-
tion, garnering five of six wins.
Randi Belkin was the only Pan-
therette to earn a win by defeating
Laura Burdell. 3-6. 6-2. 6-0.

“Randi started out slow, due to
the cold weather,” said Coach Fran
Webster of his stalwart’s perfor-
mance. “She made her adjustments

for the second set. and then
outclassed Burdell for the win.”

Belkin has yet to be beaten in
singles competition this season.

After this initial victory, Pitt
could not muster an attack. West
Virginia completely dominated

play. Cathy Jacobson Pitt's

“Instead of the rain keeping us in
the game like it did so many times
last season, it hindered us,” said
Hughes. “Last year we were lucky
being at our. home field when their
was so much_ rain throughtout the
season, because we had the advan-
tage. Against Gannon, it kept us
from scoring so many goals. We
should have had about eight goals
against them.”

The Panther defense, led in goal

’ by T hunberg, played phenomenally

against Gannon. When the offense
was dominating around the Pitt
goal mouth, the defense was tack-
ing, working, and totally outpower-
ing the’Gannon attackers, allowing
them only four attempts at scoring
in the entire game. According to
Thunberg, the hardest shots that he
had all evening came from his own
defenders tapping the ball back to
start another play.

“We were the offense and they
were the defense throughout the en-
tire game, said Richmond.‘ “We
have many of the injured players
back in action. And even if we are
playing with some people who are a
little sick, we are still tough. I don't
think that we have a weakness one
the field. The midfield is taking
control of the defense. The defense
is so solid they didn’t even give
Gannon a chance. The attackers
are scoring a lot of goals, and Scott
looks just great in the nets.

A big difference in the Panthers
success this season comes from a
change of attitude on the field. It’s
a unaminous belief among the Pan-‘
ther booters that a great deal of
their winning comes from that

   

change. The games aren’t a
business for the Pitt booters; it’s
playing and having fun. It’s also
winning.

“For the first time in a long while
we’re confident that we can take it
to a team and we know what our
teammates can do around us.” said
Hamm. “We don’t just anitcipate,
we know. We aren’t subbing a lot,
but the guys on the bench are so
tremendous. They are so into the
winning and they add so much to
the confidence and optimism that
we have. Those who do play a lot,
like Jerry Wasson, and Nick Wilson
have developed that same
understanding on the field. They‘

éare able to work into the lineup
really well.

“The attitude is just so good,”
said Richmond. “We’re all playing
really loose, but when we go out on
that field, we know just what we
have to do to win. And we do it.
Gannon was a blowout, just as
Grove City was. We've been totally
dominating our opposition, I've
developed a new term to describe
our season; that is we are beginning

to Akron-ize our opponents. We '

are doing to everyone what Akron
did to us in our first game. (Akron
beat the Panthers back in early
September 4-1)

The Panthers can keep on
Akron-izing opponents next week
when they will go on the road again
to meet rival Bethany.

The team in West Virginia may
prove to be another stepping stone
for Pitt in their bid for success in
eastern soccer.

Pitt News Sports Writer
Mike Dombroski has come a long
way. Four years ago, he set out to
prove himself by being a walk-on at

Pitt. For a walk-on to achieve
recognition is rare. Mike Dom-
broski has. \

Walk-ons are players who are in-
vited to play but do so on their own
initiative. If the coaches are to
notice a walk-on, he must, show
them that he really _is something
special. It is then that the walk-on
becomes a scholarshipplayer. To-

@day, Mike Dombroski is a scholar-

Offensive tackle Larry Brown of -

ship player.

The story does not stop there,
however. Making it was one thing,
playing another.

“When I was a walk on, I reallv

set out to prove myself._ That was
my first goal. I never really
doubted that I was a major college
player,” said Dombroski. “My
first two years I backed up Steve
Gaustad and Benjie Pryor.”
Dombroski waits no more. Bas-
A ed on his performance, he has earn-
ed himself a spot in the offense.

Last year "Dombroski played
mostly on third-and-short situa-
tions, mostly to block. It was about
the middle of the season that he
began to assert himself as‘ more
than just an extra blocker. Dom-
broski showed he could get‘ open
and catch passes. ,

Pitt ran a two-tight-end offense
against Penn State and, finally, it
was in the Fiesta Bowl that Dom-

3

broski had his finest hour of 1979.
In that game, he made several key
grabs and paved the way for a Pan-
ther victory.

That has continued so far this
season. The season is only three
games old but already Dombroski
has caught three passes and scored a
touchdown. His six-pointer came
in his only start, against Kansas.
How does Dombroski feel about
suddenly being in the limelight?

“It feels great. I worked hard for
it and I consider it my reward, but
I’m not going to get big-headed
about it,” he said.

Now that he has established

himself as a weapon in the Panther‘

offense, Dombroski can look to
every game and know that_he will be

in there. The frustration of not
playing is gone.

“Right now I’m the second-team
tight end and that’s very hard for
me to accept, but I know that I will
play a great deal in a game.”

The Panther offense has been
under some criticism lately, due to
the fact that they have not been able
to establish a running attack. Dom-
broski does not agree with the
criticism. "

“I don’t think it's bad at all that
we throw a'lot. Look at the San
Diego Chargers; they throw a lot.
Brigham Young also has a lot of
success in throwing the ball,” he
said. “We” have good running
backs and we'll run the ball more

weanesday, October 8, useo_ti.ge is

but, right now, we’ve been effec-
tive.” -

Dombroski has but one personal
goal and that is to win.

“Personally, I'd like to win every
game. If I can contribute to that,
I’d be happy. Team effort is really
what counts.”

“We’ve been improving each,

week. We really needed the playing
experience and Boston College and
Kansas were sort of sleepers,” the
Panther tight end said. “If we stay
healthy, we'll be okay.” I

It has been a hard fight for Mike
Dombroski but he has triumphed.
His dream is to play professional
football and if he puts as much ef-
fort in that as he did here at Pitt,
then he will have a good chance.

the Pittsburgh Steelers will tell you
that pass protection is no picnic.

“I wish I could say pass protec-
on was easy and fun,” the

6-foot-4, 270-pounder said with a
laugh.

“You are sitting there and you

you. He has all the advantages
because he can see the quarterback,
can move in different directions and
can use his hands.”

But Brown counters with finesse
and brute force of his own, and he

is one big reason why opponents ,

have only sacked Steeler quarter-
back Terry Bradshaw five times this

season going into Sunday’s game

And Brown’s accomplishments
are heightened by the fact that he
has played. offensive tackle for only

four of his 10 National Football .

League seasons with Pittsburgh. _

He was a tight end in six Steeler
seasons before that a 230-pound
tight end. And he's added about 40
pounds of muscle through
weightlifting the past four years,
while still mainitaining a 32-inch
waist. '

“Since moving to tackle, I’ve
tried to add. seven or eight solid
pounds each year,” he said. “Part
of that isematurity, but part of it is
eating a lot and hitting the
weights.”

He does his weightlifting year

linemen, including All-Pro center
Mike Webster and guard Steve
Courson. ‘

“As a tight end, I worked out a
little on my own at a spa,” Brown
said. “As a tackle, I've had tolearn
and fully understand the principles
of weights as far as gaining weight
and adding the right kind of
strength.” '

During his college career at Kan-
sas, Brown played defensive end,
offensive tackle, linebacer and tight
end. And Pittsburgh drafted him on
the fifth round in 1971.

Now, he has found a permanent
position.

“I’m really still learning, but I do
feel‘ more comfortable now as com-
pared to a few seasons ago,” said
