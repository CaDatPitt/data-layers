Series Of Five Movie Programs

‘The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari’
Opens Latest Showing
Of Foreign Films

 

By William R. Murray

With the showing tomorrow eve-
ning in Frick Auditorium of “The
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,” celebrated
foreign ﬁlm, and “Spring Class,”
movie produced on the University
campus, the department of ﬁne arts
will ofiicially begin its new season of
motion pictures. '

German and French ﬁlms tracing
the rise of the cinema in Europe
from 1896 to the present, including
both silent and sound movies, will
be shown in a series of ﬁve programs,
of which tomorrow night’s is the ﬁrst.

Most Widely Known German Film

“The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,” pro-
duced in 1919 by Decla-Bioscop, is
by far the most widely known of
the German ﬁlms. Directed by Rob-
ert Weine, the cast includes Conrad
Veidt in ‘the role of Cesare, the*Som-
nambulist, and Werner Kraus as Dr.
Caligari. Through the medium of
blocks and planes, in the manner of
a cubist painting, the story of an
inmate of an insane asylum is told.

Warm, Rohrig, and Reimann de-
signed and executed the settings sur-
realistically to suggest rather than
depict atmosphere and feeling. Pho-
tography is by Hameister.

“Spring Class” was conceived, di-
rected and photographed on campus
last year by Philip C. Elliott, asso-
ciate professor of ﬁne arts. The
movie is an impressionistic view of

Photographs of winter scenes in
the South, dinner at Heinz House,
and a visit to the Pitt-Notre Danie

basketball game are high spots on
the program for the joint YM-YWCA
Association Night,
5:15 o’clock this evening.

After dinner has been served, be-
ginning at 5:15 o’clock, Dr. 0. E.
Jennings, professor of biology and
head of the department, will give a
lecture on “January in the South,”
illustrated with slides of photographs
which he has taken on his 12 trips
to the South.

At 7 o’clock the Association Night-
ers will leave Heinz House for the
Stadium to see the Pitt-Notre Dame
basketball game.

Dorothy Kerr, C37, and Robert
Worthing, C37, are chairmen of ar-
rangements for Association Night.
Any students interested are welcome
to attend. The only charge is 30
cents for the dinner.

Miss Thralls F etes Quax

Members of Quax, women's honor-
ary science. fraternity, will be the
guests of Miss Zoe Thralls, assistant
professor of geography a.nd adviser
to the group, at her home tomorrow
evening.

 

Panhellenic Formal
Banquet Postponed

Instead of the lead spot, and a cut,
the Panhellenic Council story rates
nothing more than a two inch notice
that the annual formal banquet
sponsored by the Council has been
postponed until the second semester.

The banquet, originally scheduled
for tomorrow night, has been delayed
because of the great number of
absences due to illness, and also be-

cause fraternity women as well as the‘

rest of the students are spending; all
their spare time at this season of the
year studying for exams.

Those who have purchased tickets
for the affair, may return them and
get their money back from their
Council representative, who in turn
will give the tickets to Marian Messer,
Ed37, chairman of the banquet.

Barbara ' Thomas, ’ BA37, ' president
of the senior Womensclass, as‘ is
customary, is chairman of~'the affair.
 it is her opinioiithat: :“Fo;_-‘p,ll

men and women who are unfamiliar
with the custom, it should be gen-

free to ask any man to the affair.
Don’t let that nodding acquaintance
come to nodding at all. Ask him to

Ione Williams, Ed38, treasurer of
WSGA, has been appointed business
manager .,and she feels that: “Coeds
should have begun to chalk up the

G-Man Stuff!

Federal Agents Finger Print
Engineers Tomorrow

   

Two hundred engineers will be ﬁn-
gerprinted by a Federal Bureau of
Investigation agent tomorrow morn-
ing.

Ah, but it isn't what you think!
Not a single engineer has ever been
convicted in a la.w court. The pur-
pose of the ﬁngerprinting is merely
to enlarge the personal ﬁles of the
bureau at Washington, whose plan it
is to catalogue as many of the Amer-
ican public as will submit, so that
‘fewer persons will be on the “un-
identiﬁed” list of fatalities.

A real, live “G Man” will do the
ﬁngerprinting. L. V. Boardman, spe-
cial investigator of the Pittsburgh
division of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, will speak at the CE
seminar tomorrow at 11:30 o’clock,
in Room 313, Cathedral, on “The
FBI Burcau——How It Operates.”

Following this talk those engineers
who volunteer to have their names
and ﬁngerprints listed in the personal
ﬁles at Washington will be given the
opportunity by Mr. Boardman to have
this done.

Mr. Boardman, explaining this pro-

cedure, says that each year the hu-
reau has been asked to investigate
many missing persons, cases or peo-
ple in accidents, who cannot be iden-
tiﬁed.

As this is something of a novelty,
the Civil Engineering department has
invited all the students to attend the
meeting, and, if the time permits, to
be ﬁngerprinted.

Classes Dismissed

Notice to members of the Fac-
ulties of the College and the
School of Business Administration:

Students of the School of Busi-
ness Administration will join with
College students in Friday's as-
sembly. College and Business Ad-'
ministration classes, except those-
enrolling chieﬂy students from
Engineering, Mines and Education,
will be omitted the fourth hour on
Friday in order that the students
and members of the two faculties
may attend the assembly.

We should appreciate it very
much if faculty members in other
schools will also excuse College and
Business Administration students
during that period so that they
may attend the assembly. ‘

is made of symbolism.

Several students and graduates of
the University comprise the cast.
Charles Foreman, graduate assistant
in the department of English, plays
the lea-d opposite Jean Lawson, C37 .
Also in a prominent part is Sarabel
Browarski, of the Drama School of
Carnegie Institute of Technology.
Dr.- Benjamin Williams, professor of
political science, appears in the role
of the teacher.

“The Golem” on Program

Three other ﬁlms as well as a few
primitive German ﬁlms by the pioneer
Skladonowsky, will be shown tomor-
row evening. These are “Don Juan's
Wedding,” “Misunderstood” and “The
Golem.”

“Don Juan's Wedding” is a comedy
starring Giampetro. “Misunderstood"
is a melodrama with Henny Porten,
famous German actress.

One sequence only of “The Golem”
will be shown. Directed by Paul
Wegener for UFA in 1920, it is a
picturization with expressionist set-
ting of the ancient Jewish legend of
a monster created by a certain “Rab-
bi Loew,-” played by Albert ‘Stein-
ruck. Wegener himself plays the
part of “The Goleni.” Karl Freund
photographed the movie.

Corsages, Nichols
Included In Price
Of Prom Tickets

Committee Expects Record
Crowd At ‘Top’ Event
On Social Calendar

 

 

“A lovely three-gardenia corsage,
the Hotel William Penn, and ‘Red’
Nichols and his 17 Pennies—.-the top
bargain for the year’s top social
event, all for four dollars,” says
Thyrsa Agness Amos, C, chairman of
the Junior Prom committee.

“That the University students have
wanted a really ‘ace’ band on cam-
pus is certain now,-' for, since tickets
went on sale, the committee has had
little or no diflicultywith sales.”

The dance, to be held January 15,
is traditionally formal, but has not
had a “name” band for several years.
The committee felt that-the time was
ripe on campus to bring in a band
which would cause probably the
largest dance budget in University
history.

Chaperones Announced

The dean of men’s oﬂice concurred
in allowing this large budget, but only
with the warning that “if the dance
fails to go over it will be a long time
before another expensive band is
brought here.”

A chaperone list of four members
of the faculty and their wives, was
announced today. The list includes
Dr. and Mrs. Carroll'R. Daugherty,
Dr. and Mrs. Omar C. Held, Dr. and
Mrs. Richard Hope and Major and
Mrs. Harry B. Gant't.

A ﬁnal opportunity to hear the
Nichols’ orchestra as they play over
a nation-wide hookup from the May-
fair-Casino in Cleveland, will be to-
morrow night at 11:30 o’clock, over
WJAS.

It is barely possible that a nation-
wide network broadcast . from the
William Penn duringthe dance will
be accomplished. The Columbia
Broadcasting System is trying to
work out an arrangement whereby
they can spare a half-hour for the
Sesqui-Centennial dance broadcast.

EA Sgmokeir Set
For Trees Gym
Tomorrow Night

 

The Engineering Association smok-
er, the second event of the associa-
tion’s social calendar, will be held at
the Trees Gym tomorrow evening at
8 o’clock.

Admission to the smoker was in-
cluded in the ticket to the Engineer-
ing Association dance in October.
Due to the postponement of the has-
ketball tournament, the presentation
of the basketball trophy will not be
held as scheduled, but Chairman Wil-
liam Kurtz, '37, promises to have on
the program a group of varied enter-
tainers, including a magician, a car-
toonist from one of the local news-
papers, and several musicians.

Cwens, Druids
Ready Today

For Dance

Billy Hall's Orchestra Plays
For Traditional Affair
At Webster Hall

 

Tradition will be reestablished this
afternoon at 3 o’clock in the Rain-
bow Room of Webster Hall when
Druids, national sophomore honorary
activities fraternity, joins hands with
its sister organization, Cwens, and
sponsors a tea dance. ’

Allverbal disagreements have been
ironed out. “Why, it was preposter-
ous,” said Leonard Levison, C39,
president of Druids. “I didn't mean
to belittle our orchestra. I only
meant that Billy Hall wasn’t quite as
good as Kemp or Whiteman. I’m
misunderstood.”

Levison got together with Dorothey
Deering, C39, president of Cwens,
and they found that they were both
in agreement on one point. In a joint
statement they said: “This is going
to be the best tea dance that the
campus has ever seen. We have a
swell orchestra, a swell place to
dance, and we are going to have a
swell dance. And besides, the presi-
dent of Druids is a gentleman.”

Tickets At Door

Billy Hall, a'newcomer to the Pitt
campus, will provide the music in
the newly decorated Rainbow Room.
His smooth rhythms, which are some-
what on the order of Wayne King
or Meredith Wilson’s, will last until 6
o’clock.

There has been no advance sale
of tickets. All admissions will be
‘taken care of at the door. The price
is 25 cents, a tea dance low.

Collaborating on the arrangements
for this affair have been a committee
of Cwens and Druids. Rosemary
Lutz, chairman, Mary Jane Patter-
son and Marion Patterson represented
Cwens. William Hoeveler, chairman,
Louis Reilly and John Downie are the
Druid members of the committee.

Chambers Will Retire

Real Speech At Record
Testimonial Dinner

 

By Westbook Kegler

Last Monday evening’s pep talks.
clipped and stolen -from the school.
of “Now get in there and ﬁght!”,
should cause many a grey-haired
alumnus and Pittsburghers to brush
away a tear in remembrance of that
patriotic event during the years to
come.

Mixed in with one of the most
beautiful exhibitions of ﬁlibustering
this side of Washington, as presented
by an old and tried hand, Senator
James J. Davis, E. V. Babcock, mem-
ber of the board of trustees and ex-
mayor, staged the largest and most
ambitious testimonial banquet ever
atempted in these parts.

Heroes Squirm

The scene was 17 floors up in one
of Pittsburgh's better hotel. The
theme, we mentioned before, was:
“Boys, you were great out there when
you drove thevictory torch of Pitts-
burgh, Allegheny County, Western
Pennsylvania, and all points east of
the Mississippi (the city of Pitts-
burgh came in twice for its share of
the spoils) to the top of the highest
peak in the Rocky Mountain area."

While 30—odd heroes squirmed in
their chairs, itching to make use of
dance tickets presented by a national
chain store, they were told no less
than 17 times, one for each floor in
the hotel, by eight different speakers,
that they had the finest coach in the
country, that they were the greatest
football team in the country, though
(slyly) that Duquesne, too, must
come in for its share of the spoils.

We counted 565 players reporting
at the starting whistle, hungry and
jostled, but still beaming with pride.
These included seven guys from
Dartmouth who sat at our table, good
fellows all.

The Good Uninebriate Judge of
“You better look out, or Musinanno
will get you” fame, came in late
for his 500 handshakes, with soft,
ﬂowing hair a’waving, ﬁre in his eye,
and a soft pat of vote-for-me love

Claims Vested Interests '
Oppose Projects

9 Plans before the current session of
the State Legislature for reorganiza-
tion of relief administration in Penn-
sylvania are opposed only by “vested
interests,” Curtis A. Williams, secre-
tary of the State Public Charities
Association, declared Monday at In-
quiry Forum. 

Mr. Williams, who is also a mem-
ber of the Pennsylvania Citizens’
Committee for the Studyof the Good-
rich Report, discredited some of the
criticisms that have recently been
"leveled at the plan" drawn up by a
Governor’s committee? headed by
Dean Herbert F. Goodrich of the
University of Pennsylvania Law
School. 

“The only opposition so far,” he
said, “has come from those who
would lose their jobs through- its
adoption. Furtl1ern1o1'e,’.’ he added.
“this is not a social,‘ _V,wo1'k racket.
There is not a» single" 'social_worker
on ‘the Goodrich committee.” _

The relief executive quoted; some_
statistics in attempting to prove that

stituted in Elizabethan days, is inade-
quate "to administer present-day re-
lief. At present, he said, there are
425 poor districts in Pennsylvania,
embracing nine different forms of re-
lief administered in_ each county by
ﬁve separate agencies; nearly .t,000
directors or overseers of .the poor,
and an administration cost of 18 mil-
liondollars a year. In addition, he
revealed, there is no uniform system
of bookkeeping, a condition conducive
‘tograft. , r ~- .-
The “one bright spot”. iI1,~t11e,Stat..%f
welfare system, he. said, is the'lVloth--
ers’ Assistance Fund. Even this, he
reported, is not state—wide, and makes‘
provision for only half the eligible
populace. _ , . _
A “Relief,”. he declared, ‘-‘must; be
given’ in a statesmanlike, scientiﬁc
and humane way. The relief problem
will be’:wi'th us for a long time.”
The “Goodrich report‘,~“advocated by
the speaker,‘ proposesaa state-wide
program of public assistance to.be
administered through a single public
organization in each county under the
supervision of a single permanent
department of the state government
to be called the Department of Assist-
ance. It would also call for assump-
tion of the ﬁnancial cost of ‘public
assistance by the state, merit system

No, Mister, these‘ are not sign-a‘is.
We just found them chalked on_..one’
of the_ cement posts in our new
oﬂice, in Room 809, Cathedral, and
we’re puzzled as you must be. And
we’ve inquired, too.

We asked RXG and his secretary,
Maxie Christensen, and they knew
nothing about it. Couldn’t even at-
tempt to explain it. Claimed they‘
never noticed it before, although they
occupied our quarters before we mi-
grated from the seventh ﬂoor during..-
the lioliclays. We interrogated fur-
ther. Mr. Graham started to type a
news release. " ._ '

Maxie answered: I -.,

“You know, maybe, it had stame-
thing to do with the number racket.
That might explain the 690

say a “few words,” to quote Mr. Bab-

the life history of every inventor

A New Sport . . .

It was sometime last week
that 12?. Pitt boys got out ‘of bed
between 6 and 6 :30 111 the
morning. Now there’s nothing so un-
usual about that. hlaybe there are a
thousand students that make the su-
preme gesture at the same hour. In
-‘fact, we know a few that get up at
ﬁve. And then_a_§y.in we know a few
that don’t get to bed until that time.

But we're not interested so much

in the thousand or so and we're
going to _do something theY..hope
theirprofs do . . . pass them . . .
and go back‘ and trail the 12 Pitt
pboysllthat we’re;more interested in
at the moment. The trail takes us
directly , to _the doors of Johnny
_._l*_'Iar_1-is’ D_uquesne_G_arde_n, which in
case you _have forgotten, is the
home of,-the Pittsburgh ice. _hoc_ke_'-,'
teams.

Inside -of the chilly Gardeil. the

_ lads laced on their skates and for the
_-better part ofan heur skated up and

dow,n—-even experts go down-—fol-
lowing pa little’ round rubber disc.
When the time came to go to classes,
the dozen Pitt boys slid out of their
skates and went to school. And
Pitt’s _ﬁrst unofficial hockey _ practice
session ended.
_It_ all started when Johnny --—Har-
ris offered the ice, for practice and
for games,»to the three Pittsburgh
college,s,_Pitt, Tech, _and Duquesne.
His plan waste. start athree-team
hockey league made up of the three
schools. Of course, Johnny has
some plan book of it all . . ., it may
be publicity . . . it ,may be just
plain good-heartedness . .’ . but we
feel that Johnny would like nothing
better than to stage a preliminary
college hockey game before-every
one of his professional and amateur
.-league games. But whatever it may
be, the plan is still. a good one.

Approved . . .

There have been hockey teams at
Pitt before, ‘the majority of them.
“back in the days when.” And it was
only a few years ago that a similar
plan tothe one proposed by M1‘...Har-

. ris was given a_.chance.- But all efforts
-' for. a lasting hockey team at Pitt have

failed.

Since _the.-_ present-.hockey -league
plan has begun, several more prac-
tices have gone by the ice boards.
Enthusiasm here is shown by the
amount of boys that. appear at the
odd-houred practices. Enthusiasm
has been shownhby each» of the.,di-
rectors of athletics -of _the three
schools in their approval of -the
plan. There is__h._ar_dly a doubt that,
with properbacking in the wr;/_of
adequate equipment, the idea
will be a. success, and hockey will
add itsgname to _the long list of
sports at the University.

ing‘ on for one score and seven
years now, with things just about
even. .
again. Tonight Notre Dame sends
its powerful basketball club against

Dr. Carlson’s, Panthers at the Stadium’ -
stamping grounds at exactly 8, o'clock.‘

Athletic prowess and*.Notre Dame
are just about synonymous. This “is

From. all reports that have b_lown
in from the West, there is .-no -ﬁeld
goal drought this year out around
South Bend. In the beginning there

was a little diﬂiculty. For one r-ease‘;-1

or another,’ ranging from _a. broken
jaw to _a tender appendix, three‘ cf
Koegan’s regulars were stationed on
the sidelines. Thataccounts for an
ea.rly.season setback by able Nor‘.'n--
western.

Irish Start Clicking

It wasn’t long before all tlie.-boys
were in their uniforms and doing
more than"just cheeri_ng for old Notre
Dame, however. When that day came,
Notre Dame’s opponents were on the
casualty list, as far as winning games
went, anyway.

Northwestern, who beat Pitt in the
Panther inaugural, was trounced in
a return game. The Wildcat defeat
was only one of four straight th;-.t—th3
Irishers have handed o11t in consecu-
tive sessions in the past few weeks.
Chicago, Kentucky, and Butler were
beaten in rapid succession and Notre
Dame will be right in the -midst of

that streak when they bound into Pitt '

tonight.

Those boys who were on the in--
jured list"-are the bulwark of the

still wears a special head‘guard to pro-
tect his broken jaw, is an All-Ameri-
can forward and only a junior at
that. Ernie Nowak, the appendicitis
victim, is an All-American center and
the term All-American isn’t being
tossed about ﬂippantly when it is

applied to these two boys. Nowak, in

the ﬁrst victory over Pitt at the Sta-
dium last year, scored 16 points.
Wrestles , In Prelim
,Cap,t.ain Ray‘-_Meyer, another vet-
eran, will team up with Moir.a_ttl1e

be Elmer Brown, who is heralded as a
“sophomore sensation.” In the recent
Northwestern game he held’ Mike Mc-
Michael, the Wildcat’s,.and also the
Big Ten’s scoring ace,,to a1_1'evenin‘g'—s
totalof no points. Wukowits, -who has
also seen -basketball se-rvic-e against

Track Te am
Received ,_:B'£d§
To -.Milil,r-08 9

Ever since‘ cross-country romped
into the ﬁnal tape late last Novem-
ber, the Pitt trackmen have ' been
drilling in ‘the indoor ‘track house.
Cross-country c_ompetitors were-given
a vacation over the holidays, but the
remainder of Olson’s outﬁt'has'be"en
out since the opening.‘

First goal in sightfor the track-

men is the annual Millrose’ Games,
scheduled for February 6.’ "Again
this year Pitt has received a bid to
participate in the Millrose Mile, the
feature event of these games and a
highlight of the indoor track season.
It is_ an exclusive affair with the com-
petition limited to those who are
proffered an invitation by the Mill-
rose committee.
The Millrose Mile is a-relay event,
with each man having 440 yards as
his share. Competition for the four
places on that team has kept the
track house warm for the past few
weeks. Two men clinched half of the
positions when Art” Thomas and
Johnny Woodruff received the official
nod from Olson.

- Six capable Olsonmen are still very
muchgin the run for the other two
places. Hurdlers Andy Lasky, Red'-
mon Oden and Ken Ryden, together
with long distance runners Harold
Tost, George Cook, and Jim Filson,
are’ making" a determined effort to
run in the Millrose. Tost, who was
the ace in the cross-country, hole this
year and who is also a good miler,

has turned in the best time among
these six. .

Pitt}-Iockey History Dating
From WUP‘ Reviewed

Another practice at 7 o’clock will
have gone over the ice by the time
the campus wakes this morning. A
group of Pitt, Tech and Duquesne
students are showing exactly how
much they want an intercollegiate
hockey league with these “before-
breakfast” practices. A ,_

As things stand now Johnny Har-
ris has offered the Duqucsne Garden
rink to the schools provided they
show‘ promise. Bob Schooley, who
with Bill Marshall, is pushing the Pitt
interests, sees a promising future. Al-
though he anticipates little action this
year, he believes that, with the
groundwork done, the idea should
catch and something deﬁnite take
form by next year. ' ’

It's History Here

Hockeyand Pitt are not cx.ac=..l_v
strangers, forback in the days of
WUP there was a nice team repre-
senting the University.
two—g'ame schedule found WUP play-
ing a scoreless season against one
point for Rensselaer and two points
-for Yale. The following season ‘the
Pitt hockey team played a heavier
schedule with a somewhat better out-
come. Two games with Tech result-
ed in one deadlock, 1-1, and a 2-1
victory for the team from across the
hollow. ’Another'Ivy leaguer, Yale,
disappointed the Pittites by dishing
out a 4-2 defeat. More favorable was
the 2-1 victory over the Pennsylvania
club. ,

.-Records for 'the 1910 season are
rather meager, showing only the rela-
tive standings‘0f a Pitt-I-’c1m State-
Tech league. ‘ Where Pitt -won one
game, lost two and tied another, a
Tech club went unde'feated.. Penn
State wound up "the season with ‘two
loses, one to I’itt,‘o11evto 'l‘-ech.

Hockey disappeared from. the
sport annuals after 1910 until a team
was organized in 1916 that had two
disastrous ‘meetings with Princeton
and Yale. The Tigers tore 21 Pan-
ther team,'6-0,_while old Eli made
4 goals to none for Pitt.

-Kappa Sigs, lrish
Play Tea Bowl Game

-We had ‘Rose, ‘Orange, Sugar,
Cotton, and Pineapple bowls, each
proclaiming that the winner of its
individual grid feature would be
the mythical champion of the grid-
iron in the United States. New
Year's Day came along and the
-slate_was-wiped clean, the losers,
the winners, and the promoters all
walking. off the field either very
happy or very sad and things went
back to normal. vi _

But there are some people who
delight in disturbing the peaceful
dreams of the. sports writers and
Martin J. Feely is one. He tosses
a cannoncracker into things byi
announcing his Panther Tea Bowl
to be played off tomorrow after-
noon on the Trees Gym Field at
4 o'clock. The two teams invited
to play are Kappa Sigs, champs
from the Inter-fraternity League
and the Irish, champions of the
Med League and victors over the
Newman Club, Independent League
champions.

Although tilic-enp;i)1ee.rs.’ intramural
basketball schedule has been made
up, plans for the independent and
inter-fraternity leagues are still in
the embryonic stage ofvdevelopment.

When Martin J. Fecly, intramural
activities head, issued his call for
entrants in the basketball league the

engineers responded by entering four"
teams, the *AI'l.<a and MES combining,"

and the chemical, industrial, clectri-’
cal and civil engim-.r.>rs each forming-:1
team, all ﬁve-Voutﬁts woven_.into an

will be played on the 'l‘rees Gym floor
at 4:30 o'clock beginning January 18.

The independent leagues will get
under way as soon as enough quin-
tefts to form a schedule are entered.
Any group on the. campus may form
a league 01' enough independents may
band together to form four or five
teams in their own league. The
games will be "played on the Trees

Protection

DURING'and immediately after_tl-ie World
War the craze among the States of the
United States was to pass what are known. as
Criminal Syndicalist L£.‘.".‘JS. The fad was so ap-
pealing that no less than thirty-seven states took
it up. To most of us this means absolutely noth-
ing. But it is interesting to note that it was not
until 1933 that the State of Oregon passed a
Criminal Syndicalist law. In 1935 the Longshore_-
men were on strike, and the’Communist Party
held a protest meeting against some illegal tac-
tics of the police. The police broke up the pro-
test meeting and a Mr. dejong was arrested.
He appealed his arrest to the State Supreme
Court, which upheld the state statute calling for
seven years’ imprisonment for anyone belonging
to an organization which even advocated a
change in the government of the United States.

A further appeal was carried to the United_

States“Supreme Court, and just last week this
body declared the Oregon Criminal Syndicalist

. Law unconstitutional.

We are so accustomed to hearing about the
Supreme Court declaring necessary social legis-
lation unconstitutional, that it is particularly
gratifying to hear of that august body actually
doing something to enforce some of our more
fundamental civil rights as set down in the Con-
stitution of the United States. -

Regardless of whether or not we agree with
the Communists, or the Longshoremen, or any
other radical organization, we cannot deny their
right, as American citizens, to express themselves
in protest‘ against obviously unconstitutional
laws. Our pleasure is unbounded in hearing
that the Supreme Court has declared a Criminal
Syndicalist Law unconstitutional, because this
action makes all of the other laws of a similar
nature unconstitutional also. We all should feel
gratiﬁed because we can never tell when anyone
of us will have a new philosophy of government,
and will demand the right to advance our ideas.

From now on all of us will look at the Supreme
Court in a different light, and reach the con-

_ clusion that maybe the- Court does justify its ex-

istence, if for no other reason than it ‘can and
will protect our civil liberties, and our funda-
mental rights as ‘deﬁned in the Constitution.

9 u "‘ ‘ .
Efficiency ln Government
THE Republican Party, when out of power,

preaches efficiency in government. The
Democratic Party, when out of power, preaches
efficiency in government. When either party is
in power we are confronted with an entirely dif-
ferent situation.

When we read of the organization of the Penn-
sylvania State House of Representatives at its
opening session, we observe with resigned placid-
ity that each member of the maj-=:ity party is on
eleven committees, and each member of the
minority is on ten committees. There are no less
than 208 members of the Lower House. This
statement takes on greater signiﬁcance when we
stop to consider that the British House of Com-
mons, with 615 members manages to legislate for
an entire country with ﬁve or six standing com-
mittees, and seems to accomplish enough to keep
that country going. .

When we add the committees in the Pennsyl-
vania State Legislature to those in the other
forty-seven states, and to those in the Congress
of the United States, and to those committees
and boards and commissions in every one of these
political entities, and to those in the. hundreds
of towns, cities, and counties of the entire coun-
try, we ﬁnd that we have real bureaucracy. And
bureaucracy is inimical to all ideals of efficiency
in politics. _

As a solution to this problem we have several
alternatives——one is to follow the lead of Nebras-
ka and to set up a unicameral "legislature, with
probably ﬁfty legislators, elected for four‘ years,
and receiving such remuneration that legislating
becomes a profession, and men above petty brib-
ery will gladly vie for responsible. positions, so
that organization can be simpliﬁed with ease. A
second alternative is the plan be_ing_proposed for
the establishment of nine economic spheres cov-
ering the entire'United States. This plan calls
for the abolishment of states, and the redivision
of the country with regard to economic inter-
ests. This plan, althou-gh' faulty in‘ many re-
spects, has much to .commend itself from the
point of view of efficiency. .

With present developments in our society all
tending toward greater efficiency, we should not
be prone to neglect’ efficiency in government as
one of the more important essentials of a civil-
ized society. . ’ _ —

At any rate, if Director Hovde,_is as 7

This arrangement of teaching and .

holding a
position is not unique here, by the
way. Dr-. Elmer Graper, head of the
department of political science, di-
vides his time between his poly sci
and membership on the board of Tax
Assessment and Revision of Alle-
gheny County. And Dr. Marian Mc-
Kay, professor of economics, advises
the state on certain taxation inat-
ters. ' '
Dr. Hovde is not a novice in prac-
tical government. Two years ago, he
was public relations director for the
Allegheny County Emergency Relief

Board, and in ‘this c'ap'a‘city received.

recognition for the t'actful_ way in
which he handled pressure groups.
Here. he also probably learned to
overcome the first pitfall of liberals,
who try to apply t00ill1uCl1'.l(l8a.llSll1_‘
too quickly. “You can’t:.ma.kc changes

And Dr. Hovde is a._liberal,_‘make
no mistake about ‘that.-“He is recog-'
nized as one of the most progressive
and forward looking men at the Uni-
versity. In fact, it was this progres-
sive thinking that almost. ruined his
opportunity for the position.’ He had
served on a committee of sponsors
for a meeting in which representa-
tives of the Spanish government pre-
sented their side of the conﬂict.

others protested when his name was

iwith-drew his name so as to not eni-
barrass the city a.dm_inis't1'ation. But
his popularity for the "job was shown
:in the number of recommendations
;he received. After 1'cc0nsi(le1‘ation,
ilie was appointed by Mayor Scully.
‘The doctor’s ideal of liberalism was
well. expressed in a statement in

Rain In’ The Cemetery I

The cemetery seems to belong to the iiiglrt, to the
morbid night. It dreams in thedarkness. It is over-
filled with silent noises that are. neither dull nor bright.
Something like the gull that soars on frozen wings,
around and around, cutting waves of silence into the
sound, and sliding over the smooth limestone blocks.
Gliding over the ﬂush stone plates, sunk in the ground.

An imperceptible hush. And then the moon plays
a slender ray of light over the blocks, but soon it
slides behind a bank of clouds, and the; blank of
darkness is complete. Stark silence is everywhere.
An old are light sputters feebly down the road, but
it almost fails to meet the blackness. Now it is
clammy cold, and rain seems to be in the._air.

There against the hillside is the mausoleum, cutting
a sharp black hole into the night.~ Jutting off to t-he
right is the jagged outline of an elm, ragged at the

peak and sleek toward the base, where it is met by the.

earth. A sentinel silhouette, a post, relieving the sharp-
ness of the building. ,  _ .
Across the lgr-avel=road, the worthy oldicaretaker
sullenly, grimly, moves, drifts‘ like a wave," like a_
wayward ghost hunting for the grave. And~then ‘he

crackles over the gravel, making a muffled'grinding'  1

noise, and disappears through the door of a ‘small hut}

All is completely stilled; a silencethat is more ﬁlled.
