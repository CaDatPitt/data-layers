index reading of more than 75 is
deﬁned as “unhealthy" or “hazar-
dous”.

A public review of the County air
pollution program was suggested
by Walter Goldburg, Pitt physics
professor, and on February 12, the
Allegheny County Board of Health
held a meeting in the County
Courthouse to review air pollution
control in Allegheny County.

Goldburg said. “At the heart of
the problem. as I see it. is the

(‘failure of the Health Department
‘and the County Commissioners to

perceive air pollution as a severe
health problem.’ .

“The same may be said for the
public. who have long since
adjusted to what they see is the
inescapable--a sore throat in the
morning. a pain in the chest or a
headache on bad days. the

and, regardless of cost the product
is removed from the market,”
Goldburg said. “But when local

 Less Commuters

BY RITA VITOLO
As the fuel shortage sputtered
into its third month aggravated by

‘ a nationwide truckers strike. the

Port Authority of Allegheny County
introduced 90 emergency transit
routes to aid struggling commut-
ers. A

Ridership was up an estimated
25% during the first l0 days of
February, the period of the strike.
Passenger Iogdsincreased by
600,000 during January, an 8.8%
increase over 1973.

The 40 cent non-permit fare will
not be reduced although ridership
has increased. but PAT promises to
“do everything possible to hold the
line on fares. The last two times
fares went up (in I969 and l97l) we
lost passengers. That's not our
business." PAT lost 14 million
passengers during the two-year
period.

   

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

An alternative to the 25 cents
time schedule charge, which was
slated to go into effect about
February 19. should be reached
sometime next week. Chancellor
Wesley W. Posvar said yesterday.

Two alternatives to the fee,»

which was the object of student
protest this week, were offered to
administrators and students Thurs-
day at two meetings. The ﬁrst was
a meeting between vice-chancellor
of Operations Joseph A. Dutton
and Student Government Board
(SGB) representatives, the second
a well-attended Student Affairs
Advisory Committee (SAAC)
meeting.

Student Government (SG) Presi-
dent Mike Furick took an SGB
proposal to Dutton at the first
meeting yesterday after Dutton had
refused to offer his alternatives in a
meeting Tuesday because the Pitt
News was present.

Claiming the University “is
attempting to recharge the stu-
dents for a service that is included
in tuition costs," the Board's
proposal included ﬁve points:

1--Time schedules could be
distributed. either through one
centralized or several» different
locations.

2--University ‘clerks will punch
validation cards to insure only one
time schedule is distributed per
student. .

3--Students who require and
receive a second copy would be
charged 50 cents to cover costs.

4--The system would only
necessitate printing 10-12.000
copies. the same estimate Opera-

The 90 emergency trips supple-
ment existing routes to the city's
distant suburbs. and will continue
until the fuel situation eases. PAT
would like to see the routes
continued indeﬁnitely.

“We hope to keep them on as
long as they're necessary; our
ridership has increased so much
that we're hoping the people of
Pittsburgh have finally caught on to
taking the bus. They must either
like it, or decided it’s the best thing
for them,” said PAT spokesman
Robert Beachler yesterday.

Despite a week-long strike by
drivers" in December. 92 million
Pittsburghers were convinced to go

" PAT in 1973. a net increase of one

million over the previous year.
"Every available piece of equip-
ment" is being used to beef up
PAT's service during the energy
crisis. and Beachler is anticipating

tions reported their budget would

permit. -
5--The “validation card distri-

bution" system would eliminate

waste as effectively as the’

University's system of charging 25
cents for time schedules.

Dutton listened to Furick’s
proposal, raised some objections to
it, and then presented his own
plan. He reportedly released his
plan to Furick Wednesday after the
breakdown in the negotiations
Tuesday afternoon.

The three unofﬁcial points in
Dutton’s proposal are:

l--Distribute 2.500 time
schedules to advisors in the
advising center and in the College.

2--Distribute 2.500 time
schedules to convenient locations
such as: reference areas in the 19
University libraries; posts in the

various student occupied buildings, .

and bulletin boards in the
registration area.

3--The remaining estimated 5000
time schedules would be leased to
students for 25 cents due back in
2-3 days. The due date would be
stamped on the schedule.

Dutton and Student Government

‘each charged the other's plan was

“too cumbersome.". .

Furick maintained the Board‘s
plan was not awkward or burden-
some. citing the process of
stamping validation cards is used
for every home football and
basketball game. A

“At the games, 5,000 students
fill the stands in an hour. It doesn’t
take days,” Furick said. “The
Athletic Department is doing it and
it is working.”

Go PAT

no curtailments.

“Mass transit has been given
priority in fuel allotments, and we
don’t forsee any immediate diff‘ -
cultv in keeping the buses running.
We have contract for 8.6 million
gallons of diesel fuel as it stands.”
Another 600,000 gallons would be
helpful, Beachler said, to meet the
additional demand.

A week-end family fare package
inaugurated the ﬁrst weekend in
February is the only ﬁnancial break
PAT has planned for commuters
according to Superintendent of
Rates and Services. Harold Norris.
The pass. which costs $1 from the
driver. is valid from 10 am
Saturday until 4 am Monday for
two adults and two children under
16. or one adult and three children.
The group pass is valid for the
entire weekend period on every
Port Authority bus and trolley.

/.

Holding that his system is only a
matter of “shuffling quarters back
‘and forth," Dutton said the
validation checking would be
confusing because the clerk in-
volved must punch the correct
number and correlate the valida-
tion and the ID card with the

person requesting a time schedule. ’

Dutton maintained cost savings
is a principle factor in his proposal
to rent the time schedules. In
reviewing the Board’s«proposal he
said. “I'll have to check my clerical
costs." .

The administration said it had
anticipated a savings of $10,000
this year in the time schedule
operation.

These following objections to
SG’s plan were raised by the
Vice-chancellorzi

—-Students with special loans and
aid may have difﬁculty obtaining a
validation card.

--Waste" would‘ not be reduced.

Cause of New Admissions

The movie The Exorcist was not
the major cause of mental
disturbance in the 12 persons
seeking psychiatric help at Wes-
tern Psychiatric Institute and Clinic
in the past monthfaccording to Dr.
Jack A. Wolford. chief of adult
services.

Contrary to ‘earlier reports,
Wolford said-“The movie was only
one factor among the complex
problems which led these people

to seek help.

as "Furick maintained. Dutton

explained students would get their 

free time schedule in March with a
validation card. but it was unlikely
they would keep it until September,
almost six months away, when
schedules are needed for add-drop.
For this reason, Dutton said, more
time schedules would be needed
and there would be no reduction in

.waste. .
Members of SG and other

students at the SAAC meeting
voiced these objections to Dutton’s
plan:

--It was too inconvenient.

--It would create a dangerous
shortage because many students
would not return their time
schedule for the 25 cents deposit
therefore eliminating the “bank"
of time schedules available.

--Students could easily tear out
parts of the time schedule that

..suited their particular needs and

experience which is as vivid’ as The
Exorcist might trigger people to
request help for other long--
standing mental troubles.

Jeffrey Romoff. spokesman for

of media. and The Exorcist in
particular. could not be viewed as a
direct cause of mental illness. "In

The fate of several campus

i “ organizations remained undecided

Wednesday as the new Student

I {Government Board (SGB) voted to

table three requests for University
recognition.

The Board members expressed
uncertainty over what direction
they will take in recognizing new
groups. They expect to establish
.. new standards for recognition and
to determine .“what groups will be
low-priority with regard to fund-

S ~ ing” by the February 28 meeting

with campus organizations. The
Board will explain the allocations
procedure at this meeting, which is
mandatory for all organizations
desiring funding for the next year.
The Committee on Student
Organizations (CSO) recommended
the Board recognize all six groups
under consideration Wednesday.
The groups were: Alpha Epsilon

’ Delta (AED). Fellowship of Chris-

tian Athletes (FCA), Campus
Crusade for Christ (CCC), Top Hat
Club. Fencing Club. and Third
World Coalition (TWC).

The Board and several students
at the meeting questioned F CA and
CCC representatives about the
overlapping natures of their groups
and that of the University of
Pittsburgh Christian Fellowship, a
currently recognized activity. CCC
campus director Bill Malick main-
tained there is a fine line of

distinction and said each of the
three groups has its own nation--
wide body.

Malick said the CCC requested
recognition “to be able to provide
our students with a room they can
use every week and to...provide an
opportunity to bring on speakers."

When asked whether the func-
tion of his group is to convert
students to Christianity. Malick
said it is to inform students about
Christianity.

SGB member Pat Kablach
motioned the Board table the CCC
and FCA requests until “the fine
line” could be further studied,
probably by next Wednesday’s
meeting.

She added the TWC request to
her tabling motion because of
possible overlapping with other
political groups recognized by the
University. The motion was
unanimously passed.

AED, a pre-med. -dent, and -vet
honorary group. was granted
recognition by a 3-1 vote. Bruce
Keeler and Nguyen Thi Kim Loan
abstained.

When Board President Mike
Furick declared AED recognized,
Keeler protested the group’s
request had not_received a majority
of the votes. An argument
followed concerning the status of
abstentions.

Furick said. “The vote's going to

r-..g'..4_=1-um PITT Ni§Ws—Friday, February is, 1974

Editorial

A Two alternatives to the time schedule fee, one from the ad-

. liministration and one from students,-have evolved out of this
I  past week’s negotiations.

’ The student proposal, as submitted by Student Government,
addresses student concern for maximum convenience, it avoids

‘ establishing what student leaders termed a “dangerous preci-

dent,” and insures students have a personal copy of the sched-
ule. “It is at the same time, an adquate response to the admin-
istration’s valid concern to reduce waste and expense.

The administration proposal is unsatisfactory. It fails to
consider two essential student requirements: convenience and
use of the time schedule from the time of registration until the
end of the term.

The proposal, as presented by Vice-Chancellor of Operations
Joseph Dutton, will involve waiting in line for a schedule, pay-
ing 250; for it and having the schedule stamped due in 2-3 days.
After using the schedule for 2-3 days the student would line up

-again, wait to return the schedule and collect the 25¢ deposit.

It is doubtful a student will be finished with the schedule
within 2-3 days. If he returns the schedule late he will be as-
sessed an extra fee? If he returns the book with coffee stains
will the 25¢ be returned? With maple syrup? Who will be re-
sponsible for distinguishing between the acceptable and the mis-_
treated schedule?

When the student decides to add-drop it will be back in
line again to check out another schedule and back in line in an-
other 2-3 days to return it, not to mention back in line to add and
back in line to drop. 1

It is highly unlikely that the student who values his time will
submit himself to this endless series of lines. Any student who
can afford the 25¢ will make the investment and never return the
schedule.

If this proves true, we will have far fewer students than an-
ticipated recycling the schedules. The eventuality of a sched-

A ule shortage is very likely.

If students fail to return the schedule because they feel they
need their own personal copy to refer to from the time of reg-
istration until the end of the term and because they want to save
themselves the time and trouble of waiting in lines, we will, in
effect be paying for the schedules as originally proposed by the
administration.

In sharp contrast, the proposal presented by Student Gov-

Energy ttrﬁsﬁsa

(Ed. Note: The following article
was condensed by Dan Cronin, a
member of Pitt’s YSA, from an
article which appeared in the
international socialist review]

Did you ever wonder during
these last few months how the most
advanced industrialized system
could allow itself to run short of its
lifeblood. oil? The most orthodox
answer is to believe that a natural
shortage exists, but there is little
evidence to support the govern-
ment's and oil industry's claim of
innocence and powerlessness to
alleviate the current crises.

A 1972 Department of Interior
report states, “Our nation has been
bountifully endowed with a large
resource base of fuel minerals,
which include petroleum, natural
gas. coal, oil, shale, uranium, and
thorium. The energy content of the
known resources of these fuel
minerals amounts to quadrillion
B.T.U. s (British Thermal Units),
enough to last 190 years at the rate
of energy use in 1970." Later in
the same report. “...the potential

-resources of fuel minerals that are

on the verge of use but await
technologic advance will last 16,500
years at the rate of energy use in
1970." It is clear that there would
be no shortage if we had chosen to
develop our available resources.
What would concern us at the
moment, however. is the availabil-
ity of oil’ products now. Again the
resources are available. A report
prepared for a Senate committee
states, “it has been estimated that
the ultimate reserves of oil in the
lower 48 states could be between
575 billion and 2,400 barrels.
Present_proven reserves are 36.5
billion barrels. The ultimate
natural gas reserves have been
estimated to be between 1,250
trillion and 2.175 trillion cubic feet.
Present proven reserves are
estimated at about 275 trillion cubic
feet." (emphasis added) These
prove reserves can be extracted
now at current prices. The Wall
Street Journal commented on Dec.
27: “...a few dollars per barrel
price increase would likely have the
effect of tripling U.S. oil reserves."
A belief in a national shortage of oil
products is a delusion. Evidently

the answer to the how and why of"

the energy crises must be found
elsewhere.

The answer is in the deliberate
restriction of (refinery output and
production. The major oil
companies have been able to
acquire a stranglehold on the
American consumer with the direct
aid of the Federal Government in
its special tax provisions and oil
depletion allowances.

The special tax breaks are
accorded to oil producers in order
to “encourage" resource develop-
ment. The reﬁning companies are
not accorded this proﬁt protection;
only producers are. The major
ﬁrms are integrated. that is, they
produce, reﬁne. retail. and domi-
nate. An F.T.C. report maintains
that “it pays (the major integrated
ﬁrms) to raise crude prices up to a
point where reﬁning proﬁts have
been reduced to zero." The major
ﬁrms then. can (with a little help
from their tax breaks) afford to
reﬁne oil for virtually nothing.

Unfortunately for the indepen-

dent refiners, they can’t afford to.

keep their profit margins so low.
This has had a monopolizing effect.
Even though there are 129
independent U.S. companies en-
gaged in refining, -the top eight oil
firms accounted for 58 per cent of
total capacity. The top twenty
accounted for 86 per cent of
capacity. In addition to this
concentration, there has not been
one new entrant into refining of any
significant size since 1950. The
latest price jump in crude oil should
put many of the remaining
independents out of business, and
consolidate the oil cartel’s hold on
refining.
In addition to establishing and
expanding a monopoly on reﬁning

‘crude oil. they have planned a

reﬁnery shortage in order to insure
a long term energy crisis and the
resulting high proﬁts.

The dress rehearsal for the
year’s crisis was the heating fuel
shortage of last winter. From the
New York Post of Nov. 9, 1973, “As
outlined in the Senate study, the
ten largest reﬁning operators in the
U.S. made last week’s shortage
‘inevitable’ a year earlier...by
reducing operation of their re-
ﬁneries in the first four months (of
1972) from 92 per cent of
capacity--regarded as the max-
imum production sustainable over
a long period--to an average 89 per
cent of capacity."

Moreover, the study found the
ten leaders--Exxon, American
[Standard of Ind.], Texaco, Shell,
Gulf, Mobil, Atlantic Richfield,
Sunoco, Standard of Ohio, and
Standard of Calif.--deliberately
reduced their inventories of oil
products until by Sept. 1972, stocks
of heating oil were as much as ten
per cent below 1971 listings.”

The reason for this cutback is
made clear by the oil companies
themselves. “Humble (Exxon)
spokesman acknowledged that the
oil industry would have to run at
93.9 per cent capacity for the rest of
the year to produce adequate
distillate supplies.” But, “eco-
nomic incentive to operate at that
level does not exist." Shell
demanded that steps be taken “to
provide the industry with sufﬁcient
economic incentive to maximize
No. 2 fuel manufacture...While
the precise amount of incentive is
difficult to predict, it is our best
estimate that an increase of about
1% cents per gallon in ‘ceiling
prices would be adequate to
produce an average refining
utilization of 93%.

This is a modest extortion from
the American public in exchange
for a warm winter. We should be
grateful to Shell Oil for being so
modest in its demands. But the
shortages in the past and present
will seem modest in comparison to
what the “big eight" have planned

 

in order to increase their take. As
shown above a deﬁciency of only a
few percentage points in produc-
tion capacity can cause a shortage
and increased proﬁts.

“In the _five years ended last

‘Dec. 31, there were 1.9 million

barrels a day added to domestic

- refining capacity, according to the

American Petroleum Institute, the

industry’s trade association. in their?» ‘.1

same period, demand for petrol-
eum products climbed 3 million
barrels a day.” The oil cartel is not
ignorant of these developing
shortages; unfortunately they are
too well aware of their power to
manipulate both the market and
the government to further their
interests.

“The A.I.P. estimates that the
nation will need the equivalent of
60 new reﬁneries with a total
capacity of 9 million barrels a day
by 1985 to meet projected demand.
That. time table is unlikely to be
met. Not one new reﬁnery is being

built in the United States today."x L
Only the integrated ﬁrms have the‘.

capital to build the necessary new
reﬁneries. but to meet the needs of
the American people would not be
as proﬁtable as allowing a shortage
to develop.

The energy crisis, then,. is a
proﬁt drive of the major oil
corporations at the expense of the
public. Those government ofﬁcials
that see little evidence of a
conspiracy are closing their eyes
for those that control them, the
economic oligarchy of America. To
counter this the public
mobilize in a series of mass actions
and strikes in order to force the
government to deal with the oil
cartel. ' 1

The most basic public demand is
that all ﬁnancial records and ﬁles,
all proﬁts. production statistics,
estimates of reserves, and secret
dealings, be made known to the
American people. Another im-
mediate and appropriate action is
the transformation of the oil
industry into a public utility. But
regardless of what is revealed or
done, due to the present crisis, the
public eyes are being opened to the
realization that capitalistindustry
is becoming increasingly incapable
of meeting the needs of an
advanced technological society. A
private corporation cannot, under
the capitalist system, subordinate
its needs to those of society. Thus
we see the beginnings of economic
dislocation and ecological destruc-
tion on a world scale. The
necessary effort to tap the
remaining fossil fuels and develop
alternate energy sources will be an
imposing task under the present
anarchy of production for private

proﬁt.
economy for the_beneﬁt of the
whole society, not just the

necessitates a socialist American as
a part of a world socialist
community working together for
the beneﬁt of all.

Utopian? No, required and
inevitable for our future survival,
but the oil barons. and the other
sectors of this privileged society
will not give up without a ﬁght,

“ls There Life on Other

discussion in the Student Union
ballroom. The speaker, Dr. Albert
Hibbs, a Cal Tech Physics
professor who is also a member of

the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
former NBC radio science editor,

and winner of the Peabody-

Broadcasting Award, seemed per-
fectly at ease as he spoke to the

Several minutes later it was

recognition became official.

The Top Hat Club, described as
“a social dance group,” and the
Fencing Club were also granted
recognition. The first vote for the
Fencing Club produced a 2-2 tie,
with Keeler and Mary Heider
abstaining. A second vote
recognized the Club.

Heider explained the issue was
“not the Fencing Club, but that we
should get our priorities down.”

Keeler expressed his disillusion
with the recognition procedure. ‘‘I
intend to abstain [from all
recognition votes] until we review
the CS0 by-laws." I think any 10
kids could get together and start
any club they wanted to. You could
start a prostitution club on this
campus.”

In other business, the Board
approved allocations requests for
the Legal Awareness Committee
(LAC), Pitt Dance Ensemble
(PDE), and College Young Repub-
licans(CYR). The PDE request was
for payment of a special instructor
to train the group members for
their March recital.

Furick also proposed installing a
Code-a-Phone system for the
University on a trial basis. He
likened the plan to the Dial-the--
Weather system, but said the
recorded message would list
University-sponsored speakers,
concerts, and general events
during the succeeding week.

The system would cost about
$150 for three months (April-June),
according to Furick. “There’ll be a
counter so we’ll know how many
people call. It's not very expensive
and I think it's worth a try.”

Furick felt the Code-a-Phone
could become permanent next

“Suppose,” he said, “that these
beings are more intelligent than we
are; how would they treat us? The
pig has the highest intelligence of
any domestic animal-'-and we use
him as a source of protein.”

In a low-key, informal, but often
provocative way, Hibbs reviewed
the possibilities open to the
observer, and the way in which

serious scientists go about testing

these speculations. Radio tele-
scopes are used to scan space for
radio signals, and one scientist
surveyed the surface of Mars for

_city lights, but so far nothing has

been found.

Although the chances of intel-
ligent life on Mars are practically
nil, Hibbs said there may be lower
organisms. The NASA package
scheduled to land on Mars July 4,
1976, will do much toward settling
this question.

Possibilities are similiarly slim
for Mercury and Venus. It has
been determined by» radio wave
techniques that Venus has surface
temperatures of 800 degrees
Farenheit, which makes survival
difﬁcult for life forms as we know
them. Mercury has no liquid.
Explains Hibbs: “Reaction rates
necessary for evolution depend on
the proper molecules bumping into
one another; usually this means a
liquid medium. It doesn’t have to
be water. It could be liquid
ammonia.” 1

Jupiter, he asserts, is almost
entirely gas, with a hot liquid core.

And The Crowd Listens

BY JIM MALONEY

Willie Dixon and his Chicago
Blues All Stars blew into town this
week and razed the SU Annex
three nights in a row. The former
Golden Gloves heavyweight champ
of Chicago packed a blues punch
that floored everyone within
earshot. '

Dixon is the most prolific
composer in blues. Over 300
songs, many the biggest hits of
other artists, are to his credit. He
has written for and recorded with
Muddy Waters, Howlin’ "Wolf,
Sonny Boy Williamson, Little
Walter and every Chicago blues-
man imaginable. That’s Willie
Dixon’s bass on Chuck Berry‘s
“Maybelline,” “Roll Over Bee-
thoven,” and “School Days”:

The All-Stars are just that. On
drums, Clifton James, a Chicago
veteran. Buster Benton on guitar.
Willie's son Freddy Dixon on
electric bass, Cary Bell Harrington
on harmonica and the hard driving
blues piano of Lafayette Leake.
which you migh remember from
"Johnny B. Goode". Tight and
just right they play powerhouse
blues at its finest.

Their three night stand ended
Wednesday and Oakland will never
be the same. Everything came
together. the sights. the sounds
and the feel of a mid-fifties cellar
club on Chicago's Southside. The
first set swung through several full
band shufﬂes and then turned to a
Buster Benton showpiece. “Stormy
Monday Blues". Sparks ﬂew from
the strings as he laid out his best
guitar solo of the night. His

exceptional vocal was comple-
mented by Harrington's mellow
harp line. Then, Leake took the
spotlight for (a moving rendition of
the standard “Trouble in Mind".

The crowd was ready as Willie
moved into everybody's request,

“Spoonful". Dixon's original
probably warped every Cream
record within ten miles. He

followed with a fine “Crazy ‘Bout
My Baby" and the night was his.

An overflow crowd packed into
the small building for the second
set. Word traveled fast and that
night Willie Dixon was the word. If
the first set cooked, the second
brought the house to a full boil.
Carey Bell was electric, slipping
and sliding across the stage like a
fish out of water. He hung over the
stage at times, twisting and
jumping from foot to foot. Clifton
James rocked steady on the stool
throughout, his foot beating in
blues time.

Lafayette Leake‘s number,
“Back Home in Indiana,'’ built to a
rousing climax with great inter-
action between Dixon's bass and
Leake‘s tinkling piano. Then to
Buster Benton for “Best Chicken I
Ever Had".

soul,‘ and as stirring as anything by
Otis Redding. Benton followed
with a pleading version of B.B.
King's “Thrill is Gone", a gem
from start to finish.

Then up stepped big Willie, with
a smile that comes out of nowhere,
wide enough" to light the first five
rows.- He did the much requested

Review of “/VICQ"

Is it John Eosiwood or Clint Wayne?“

BY M.C. PILECKI
When the student departs from
the path his teacher has laid and

surpasses his mentor, it's simply,

natural in the course of human
events. But when that teacher, on
the wane, does a turnabout and
scrambles to emulate his former
pupil. it's kind of sad.

And that's pretty much the story
with John Wayne's new flick McQ.

Now, which younger star made
his name as a strong, silent
(because he's also lousy with
dialogue) cowboy who spoke with
his fists and his guns and made the
world a safer place for himself?
Who was hanging ‘em high for a
fistful of dollars (and quite a roll) in
a chain of sadistic spaghetti
westerns that made him the top
international drawing card (as
decided by the people who book
films) at the box ofﬂce?

Got it? Quiz time isn't over yet,
though. Which top draw star took
his sadistic. strong and silent
character out of the dustbowls and
put him behﬁid the badge of a
modern police department. clean-
ing up a hilly West Coast city and
at box offices all over the world?

If you guessed all those right,
you've already seen McQ and don't
have to bother with the ﬂick. Just
take the plot of Dirty Harry in one
hand. put Magnum Force in the
other. and whomp! Add a lot of

Moorhead Impeoches The Evidence 

BY CONNIE GIEL

I glared at the snowﬂakesjthat
ﬂoated down on my head. Hardly
suitable weather for a drive down
to Washington. If the gas shortage
didn't get us, the icy roads
undoubtedly would. But my
misgivings mattered little to the
rest of the group--seven deter-
mined lobbyists from the New
American Movement (NAM) and
one best friend. All were dead-set
on making their impeachment
views known to Western Pennsyl-
vania Congressmen. To this end.
we loaded into a shaky Datsun and
a racy-looking station wagon.

The conversaion on the road
vaccillated from the irreverent to
the deadly serious.

“They’ll have to try him outside
the country.”

“Yeah...like South Africa or—
Brazil.” A

“I’m afraid that in raising the
question of impeachment, it won’t
be the Nixon Administration on
.trial, but instead the Republican
Party; a situation that won’t resolve
anything.”

Station-hopping with the Dat-
sun’s radio dial rewarded us by
announcing that Nixon's popularity
rating had dropped to 26%, an
all-time low. This gem was greeted

with snorts, “Twenty-six per-
cent--that's just about all the rich
people in the United States!"

lmused, “Just think, only a year
ago, Nixon was enjoying his
highest poll ratings..." But since
I'm not one to cry over spilled milk,
I didn't pursue this line of thought
very far.

The trip wasn’t without sober
reminders. National Guardsmen
patrolled the turnpike bridges,
protecting the few truckers still on
the road. “Wonder what Moor-
head’s progress report on THAT’s
gonna be?”

With the two cars practically
glued to one another, we tailgated
our way through the D.C. streets,
afraid of being separated. Sources
of ironic reflecitdn: the ﬂag atop
the Justice Building hanging
limply; the Watergate complex
dark and massive. '

Arriving at the Rayburn House
Office Building five minutes late
for our 2:30 appointment, we
ushered ourselves into Rep. Wil-
liam Moo_rhead’s (D-Pgh) ofﬁce.
Wasting little time on formalities,
Moorhead obligingly presented his
“position” on impeachment.

“I think that the evidence they

produces will persuade me to vote

going on.‘ V
Aside from watching Wayne in
his dotage, the ﬁlm is still pretty
bad. The" plot, besides being a
carbon of Magnum Force, is weak
out-of-date and with enough holes
to sink a Swiss cheese. It's
supposed to be a
mystery detective story, with each
deviation brightly labeled “red
herring.” '

And the characters. Besides
being ﬂat, anachronistic (a bunch
of “radicals” rounded up as
suspects in the police murders look
like mothballed leftovers .from

sometimes hysterical portrayal of
Diana Muldour as Lois Boyle, the
love-starved widow. Al Lettieri, as
drug leader Santiago, is probably
one of the best screen heavies to
come along recently, and is not
overly wasted here. '

The photography is often faulty,
and veteran Harry Stradling,
director of photography, should
have no excuse. There are light
changes from shot to shot within
scenes that are disconcerting even
to the casual viewer. And several
shots of the “chase scenes” have
an inappropriate graininess, as

sized, however. that the recom-
mendation has not yet been made.

Mark Cohen and Pam Harding,
Pittsubrgh members of NAM
pressed on, digging with more
substantial questions. “What do
you consider proper grounds for

impeachment?"

“...Treason. high crimes and
misdemeanors...," Moorhead
made a stab at an Ervinish.

constitution-upholding stance.
NAM insisted that Nixon's actions
of impounding funds and the
illegal. secret bombing of Cam-
bodia are inexcusable, unjustified,
and certainly grounds for impeach-
ment. Moorhead replied’ that while
both actions were wrong, they were
also too “fuzzy" and would weaken
the case for impeachment. He
stressed the need for a working
redefinition of the constitutional
impeachment clause.

At this point, Rep. John Dent
(D-Greensburg) bustled into the
meeting, toting a cigar and
sporting "a handlebar mustache.
Dent tried to steer the conversation
to safer territory. Not wanting to
dwell on the constitutional issues
of questionable legality, Dent,
nevertheless asserted, “if Nixon
didn’t know-what was going on--he,
doesn't belong in office."

When NAM protested that the
majority of the Watergate figures
were lightly penalized for their
illegal activities. Dent grinned.

Both Moorhead and Dent agreed
that ‘ a resolution is needed
forbidding presidential pardon of
those connected with the scandal.
But. as NAM pointed out. a
president on trial would hardly be
in a position to pardon.

Dent stopped grinning long
enough to tell us. “If the courts
become discredited, who in the
devil is going to worry about
crime." At that. Moorhead joined
in and reminded us of the dangers
that lie in setting precedent. The
meeting ended on a somber note
from Dent.

“If he gets away with this, who's
gonna stop the next president?”

if 20 straight

Panthers Massacre Vikings, 106-5 5

 

BY RON SIEGEL
SPORTS EDITOR

It was the St. Valentine's day
massacre all over again. The only
death that occurred was Cleveland
S_tate’s dreams of national fame by
breaking Pitt's win streak. That
streak is now up to 20, as the
Panthers rolled over the Vikings at
the Field House last night, 106-55.

“We were destroyed," said CSU
coach Ray Dieringer, who lost six
players, including three starters
from his season-opening squad.

It was a total team effort that
gave the Cats their largest victory
margin of the season. Six players
hit double ﬁgures, with Billy
Knight and, Lew Hill leading the
way with 17 points apiece.

Knight started at center in place
of Jim Bolla, who suffered a
partially dislocated shoulder in a
practice session accident. Typical
to form, the Braddock‘ senior did
not have one of his better games,
shooting eight for 17 from the floor.

“I can’t play my best in games

like this,” he admitted. Pitt coach‘

Buzz Ridl usually lets Knight stay
in the game until he reaches his
average (24 points), but the score
was so lopsided with 12 minutes to
go (72-35), Ridl had practically no
choice but to take Knight out.

Bolla’s injury meant Hill got one
of his rare starting assignments.
The Ferrum Junior College transfer
sank eight of 15 shots and led both
teams with 9 rebounds.

“It’s like old times again,”
smiled Hill in the locker room after
the game. Hill was a starter and
the leading scorer for Ferrum, but
is used by Ridl as the sixth man.

The game opened up very
monotonously, with the teams
trading ﬁve ﬁeld goals. Pitt

jumped ahead 12-10 on a Knight
jump shot, and never fell behind.

Ridl went to his bench as he has
done so successfully all season
long. With 11:54 left in the half,
Keith L Starr replaced Kirk Bruck
and the Cats rolled off 11 straight
points. Starr made one steal, one
ﬁeld goal, and got two assists in
that two minute binge.

“It was pretty obvious what was
going to happen from there,” said
Dieringer, who called a timeout
with 9:31 to go. It was the only
time out the CSU mentor called the
entire game.

Ridl also sent Ken Wagoner in
during the Pitt outburst. He
stressed that Wagoner and Starr
aren't really better (or worse) than
starters Tommy Richards and
Bruce. “Tommy and Kirk wear
down the opposition,” said Ridl.
“Then Keith and Kenny come in
fresh and make it look easy."

Richards shot seven for nine,
picking up 14 points, and notched
seven assists, giving him 80 on the
year, a team high.

Many of Richards passes went to
Knight, who put on a dazzling
demonstration of his skills. He

sent the" crowd reeling with a
reverse back-to-the-hoop layup at
5:42 of the first half.

Ridl began emptying his bench
in the ﬁrst half. He made
wholesale changes throughout the
second stanza, and the subs
performed as well as the regulars.

Freshman Wayne Talbot sunk all
three of his outside jumpers,
scoring Pitt's 100th point to send
the fans home. '

" Greg McBride, a sophomore who
has played sparingly throughout
the season, proved he wasn't stale
as he sunk three of four buckets.

BY RICK STOUFFER
While everyone is cheering on Pitt's fantastic basketball team to an
NCAA tourney bid in the wake of the “Major Change" that brought
football back to respectability, there is one sport which in seven years
has compiled a record short of phenominal.

What sport could it be? It's track and since Jim Banner took over as
head coach, Pitt has had a .615 average including two undefeated
seasons.

Banner has coached nine All-Americans, 2 NCAA champs, 3 athletes
in the Olympic trials. His men broke 14 of 16 school records and set
one American record which still stands. He was also selected to coach
the American team which met the Soviet Union last March and was the
assistant coach with the Americans as they toured Africa and Europe
last summer.

Good coaching is a must to have a good team, but dedication by the

guys is needed too. Not many people spend their summers running
1,000-1200 miles just to keep in shape, or begin practice in September
never to stop until graduation or quitting the team. .

Track men are alike everywhere. To succeed in track takes unheard
of loyalty to the sport, a pride in what you are doing, determination, a
desire to make it, but above all the gut-breaking hard work making one
literally sick.

With an approximate on-campus enrollment of 8,000, Pitt is a track
leader in every respect. Ohio State, with an enrollment or 45,000 won't
meet the tracksters in a head to head meet because they know the only
event they would win would be the pole vault. When a school that
gives out ‘/3 as many scholarships wins dual meets, as Pitt does, it is a
winner.

Good coaching, good personnel, there's still something missing. It's
facillities. Pitt's outdoor track is a good one, so good in fact that the
Eastern track championships are held here while for indoor the Pitt
Invitational is ranked as one of the East's best indoor meets with small
schools begging just to use the track. '

Even with such a great record the team hasn't gotten the coverage it
deserves. Track just doesn't draw big crowds although last year the
outdoor championship drew well due to extensive radio and TV
coverage.

Future coverage should get better. This year's team “is the best
I've had and that includes some great ones," says Banner. The
excellent record. facilities, and coaching draw explosive freshman like
honey draws bees. _

Maybe if the teams keep getting better, the tracksters and
especially Banner will ﬁnally get the recognition they deserve.

Mickey Knights Draws Fame

illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIIlllllIIllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll l-4

BY LEE GUTKIND

In the English Dept. where I teach, there's hardly
any interest in Pitt's amazing basketball team--
despite national ranking and All-American candidate
Bill Knight. Or so it seems.

As far as I can gather, most department members
think Buzz’s Bombers is a John Wayne movie about
World War II and Knight and Martin are obscure

17th century poets.

Of course. there are some notable exceptions. Bob
(CAS Dean) Marshall is spotted periodically by
shocked colleagues dribbling an imaginery basket-
ball dow the hall and executing a perfect lay-up,
overwhelming the deft defensive efforts of Chris
(Assistant Professor) Rawson.

Marshall and Rawson are interested in other sports
as -well. They are, for example, co-founders of the
University of Pittsburgh Dept. of English Chapter of
the Rico Petrocelli Fan Club. Petrocelli is a
journeyman shortstop on the verge of journeying his
way to minor league obscurity, although he’s had a
few lucky seasons. . _

Nita and Andy Solomon are also worth mentioning
as departmental sports buffs. Andy, a graduate
teaching fellow, is the author of the Semi-Annual
Dept. of English Softball Handbood and Nita, last
season, led the Faculty Intramural Softball League in
walks.

As for me. I have been working on the Pitt Writers’
Conference (February 22 and 23) and haven't had
much time for sports lately. In a letter accepting my
invitation to attend the conference, however, C.
Michael Curtis, Associate Editor of The Atlantic
Monthly, wrote that he hoped to meet Mickey
Knights while in Pittsburgh.

“Mickey Knights???" I wrote back.

“Did I say Mickey Knights?” Curtis replied a few
days later. “It’sjust that it’s been so long since Pitt
had a basketball team worth mentioning that I got a

' little confused.”

That's understandalbe. After all, Curtis is from
Boston, but what I can't understand is why my

The Indiana squad might have
moved up in the standings but it
appears that the WPIHA is a clear
CU! two team race. Pitt goalie
Mark Lieberman had an easy ‘night
in the nets as the Panther ieers
pounded away at Indiana net-
minder Ken Richcrt.

Back in uniform after sitting out
a four game suspension,
Vernon turned in another fantastic
performance scoring five goals. It
was the second time this season
Vernon has recorded a five goal
night.

Dcfcnseman Russ Stttmp lit the
redlight twice for his first scoring
binge ofthe year while Bob Arturo.
Denny Browne and Joe Testa each
added a goal to the Pitt total.

For the first time in 1974. the
sticks atid gloves were dropped
during a Pitt lcagttc encottnter and
the Panthers got off easy for a
change. Bob Arturo crossed sticks
with Indiana's Phil Russell on a
faceoff and the two went into the
corner hard after the pttck.

Russell slashed at Arturo and the
Pitt wing responded by flicking off
the gloves and pummeling his
opponcttt to the ice. Arturo wound
tip drawittg a five minute ﬁghting
ma_ior while Rttsscll drew a double
minor. Bttt Pitt received a break
when Arturo was not ejected from
the gatnc. as the new league rttles
regarding lighting require.

George "Fu(l(ly”Brymtt: I

I)ieting’ To Be A Wittiter

BY G.W. STEVENS

When George “Fuddy” Bry,ant
pinned Dave Shreck at 6:35 of their
match last Saturday afternoon.
Lock Haven coach Dr. Ken Cox was
shocked. Shreck hadn't won all of
his matches. but he had wrestled
well against some of the best
I18-pounders in the country. His
loss to Bryant marked the first time
this season that he had been caught
on his back. _

“Bryant completely dominated
tny ll8-pounder." said Cox. “I
honestly have to  that he's the
best II8-pound wrestler in the
country."

Bryant hasn't had it too easy so
far this year. He was ineligible
during the first term due to
scholastic difficulties. He returned
to action in time for the four-way
meet at Lehigh College in which
he won three matches. He followed
that up with his fourth victory in
the West Virginia dual meet.
However. he was soon forced out of
the lineup by weight problems.
missing both the Clarion and
Franklin & Marshall meets.

With the addition to this year’s
squad of 126-pound freshman
sensation Rande Stottlemyer, Bry-
ant found it necessary to remain at
the 118-pound weight class.
Therefore, he went on a strict diet
of eggs and meat, losing 14 pounds
in one week. He weighed in at 3/4
of a pound under the limit on
Saturday but didn’t seem to be
weakened at all by the crash diet as
he raised his record to 5-0.
Nevertheless, he was a little
surprised by coach Cox’s compli-
ment.

‘'1 think I'm one of the top six in
the country." Fuddy said after
receiving treatment for a cut below
the eye at the conclusion of the
match. “I just have to work hard
and do alot of running. I've never
had to lose so much weight at one
time. Ijust made up my mind that I
was going to get down to 118. so I
stayed on the high protein diet and
spent a lot of time in the sauna."

Pitt coach Dave Adams looks at it
differently. He fully agrees that
Bryant is the best in the country

and considers him to be«the best
wrestler he has coached in a long
time. He was quite impressed by
Fuddy‘s effort to get back in the
lineup.

“A "coach has to evaluate the

effort the kid is making to lose the I

weight,” Adams said. “With
Bryant, here’s never any question
about his motives. He’s made a lot

of personal sacrifices to help this
team. He’ll be OK now.”

Bryant. a Washington. Pa. native.
will have an opportunity to gain
another victory tomorrow when the
Panthers host Syracuse (8-3) in a 2
pm contest. His opponent will
probably be Tim Meredith who will
bring a personal record of 7-7 to
tomorrow’s contest.

Whether George Bryant can claim
to be the best I18-pound wrestler
in the country will be decided in the

post-season tournaments. The
Eastern championships will be held
in two weeks. at the Naval

Academy. with the National tourn-
ament being held in Ames. Iowa
two weeks later. The champion-
ship is the goal of every college
wrestler. and Bryant has to be
considered a top contender; just
ask coach Cox. .

Wom. Hoopers Lose,

46-44

Inexperienee Takes Toll

BY KEVIN NOWE

Inexperience took its toll on the
young women's varsity basketball
team, as they lost a close one to
Indiana, 46-44. Tuesday night. The
squad was able to maintain an 8 to
10 point lead throughout most of
the game. but lost the lead and the
game in the closing minutes of the
fourth quarter.

Pitt came out in a~man-to-man
defense and was able to keep the
scoring potential of Indiana at a
minimum. In an offense adopted
from Buzz Ridl. the women
constantly weaved, picked and cut
for the hoop. The women Panthers
have been working with the new
offensive attack for less than one
month. I

The battle was somewhat marred
by the sun. Because Pitt was the
home team, they had to pick the
side of the court with the sun
glaring in. The offense, usually

geared for underneath the hoop.
had to depend on outside shooting.
At one point in the game. with the
aid of the blinding sun. the women
threw two passes at the referee.

The second half saw no relief as_

the sun followed the team to the
other end of the court.

Mary Ellen Klobchar led all
scorers with 14 points, below her 20
points per game average. Captain
Sue Tweardy pulled down 8
offensive and 11' defensive re-
bounds, to lead the statistics in that
category.

Coach Sandy Bullman believed
that they could have beaten
Indiana. ‘The score doesn't always
indicate the better team. Sure. I
could use the sun as an excuse. but
we have a very young team.",

Bullman went on to say that with _

the 8-10 point lead the team lagged
on offense and were not aggressive
on defense.

Irish Romp

New York AP -- Freshman ﬂash
Adrian Dantley triggered a race-
horse offense for Notre Dame with
27 points. leading the third-ranked
Frighting Irish to a 79-69 college
basketball victory over Fordham
Thursday night at Madison Square
Garden.

In the first game of the
doubleheader. Ralph Rehn started
Fairﬁeld on a 13-2 scoring burst
that helped the Stags to a 62-44

victory over outclassed Fairleigh

Dickinson.
The brawny Fighting Irish put
away their 19th victory in 20 starts
early in the game. running away to
an 18-point lead in the first half
behind their fabulous freshman.
Dantley scored 14 of his points to
lead the hot-handed Fighting Irish
into a 46-31 halftime lead. The
closest that Fordham, 6-14, was
able to come after that was eight
points with less than a minute to
play in the game.

Notre Dame center John Shu-

a teammate under the basket late
in the game and lay on his back for
nearly three minutes while the
crowd of 14.683 remained quiet.
Shumate was given a standing
ovation when he ﬁnally got up. He
finished with 16 points.

Darryl Brown led Fordham with
23 points.

The women's varsity basketball
team has 11 or 13 new members on
the team. and Bullman believes
that this is the year for rebuilding.
But. she is quick to point out that
they are vastly improving with each
game.

Bullman was duly impressed
with the performances of freshman
Gail Evans and Joyce Bajuszik.
who were instrumental in the
victory over Duquesne. “They are
fundamental basketball players.
They hustle the entire time they're
on the court. They just don't give

Syracuse F orfeits

  Meet To

BY YAIER LEHRER

The Panther swimmers have
officially won their fifth meet of the
season as the Syracuse team
informed the Cats that they will not
be coming to the meet scheduled
tomorrow. thus forfeiting by an
11-0 score.

“I've gotten two different stories
aboutthis." said Coach Bradshaw.
“One was from the coach and one
was from the athletic director."

“According to the Syracuse
coach. he was informed that he
could not take his entire team on
the bus to Pittsburgh. Every year.
the swim, gynmastics. and wrest-
ling teams from either Pitt or
Syracuse make the trek to the
opposing city all at once. This
year. the swim coach was told that
there were not enough seats on the
bus for the whole team. The coach
decided to take. a stand and said
that he would take his whole team
or none of it. Therefore. the
Syracuse swimmers will not be able
to make it here for the scheduled
contest.

“‘The athletic director is blaming
it on the energy crisis,” said Coach
Bradshaw. “He says that if they

Tankers

take the whole team they would I, _.
have to take a station wagon and  
they could not be assured of getting '

gas.”
According to Governor Shapp's
new program of rationing. every-

one can get gas on Saturday. the . 
are . 

day the Syracuse people
supposed to come out here.
“Their team

said Coach Bradshaw. “It's very

‘possible that they are afraid to face __
us. because they know we would « ff
destroy them ifthey did come here.   V
and this gives them a chance to rest 

they've 

from the tough meets
had."
The tankers can only

forward to next Wednesday’s meet

against Kent State at home. This ~

meet will be the ﬁnal big test for
the tankers, and if they pass this
one and beat Kent State, or at least
make it close, then they will have

proven that Pitt does indeed have a , 

good swim team.

“They look better than us on I

paper." said Coach Bradshaw.

“but I haven't had a chance to. 

really look over the figures. We

still have a chance to pull it out."
